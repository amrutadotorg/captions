00:14.559 --> 00:20.000
in this

00:15.360 --> 00:20.000
108 names if you have noticed

00:20.160 --> 00:26.320
they have shown that

00:23.199 --> 00:29.359
kartikeya is the innocence

00:26.320 --> 00:32.960
that is acting on the right hand side

00:29.359 --> 00:37.440
in the pingala and that is

00:32.960 --> 00:41.120
also it is very much related to prana

00:37.440 --> 00:44.239
it gives you prana prana is the vital

00:41.120 --> 00:46.559
breath that we take

00:44.239 --> 00:48.879
breathe in and breathe out so it is

00:46.559 --> 00:51.280
related to the right side

00:48.879 --> 00:52.719
then also it is related to eternity

00:51.280 --> 00:57.840
anantari

00:52.719 --> 01:01.680
ananta is the snake or the

00:57.840 --> 01:05.600
which is the brother of vishnu

01:01.680 --> 01:09.040
so it is he who is represented here

01:05.600 --> 01:12.640
as kartikey he is called as ananta

01:09.040 --> 01:17.200
so he is the fire

01:12.640 --> 01:21.680
he is the one who ignites within you

01:17.200 --> 01:25.680
the capacity to consume the force

01:21.680 --> 01:28.720
also the capacity to command

01:25.680 --> 01:33.200
the people and

01:28.720 --> 01:37.040
also the capacity to be

01:33.200 --> 01:39.840
a person full of brilliance

01:37.040 --> 01:41.520
you see an innocent person could be very

01:39.840 --> 01:43.759
brilliant

01:41.520 --> 01:46.640
all these capacities are expressed in

01:43.759 --> 01:50.000
karthikeya's

01:46.640 --> 01:52.880
swarupa in his state

01:50.000 --> 01:54.399
today by parship worshipping karthikeya

01:52.880 --> 01:59.439
we have to know

01:54.399 --> 02:03.119
that kartikeya is now awakened within us

01:59.439 --> 02:05.920
and with that capacity

02:03.119 --> 02:06.960
we have to fight ultimately he is the

02:05.920 --> 02:10.479
nishkalanka

02:06.960 --> 02:13.760
he's the one who's the final so

02:10.479 --> 02:17.680
from ganesha to christ to nishkalanka

02:13.760 --> 02:20.800
these are the three stages into which

02:17.680 --> 02:25.120
the innocence has gone from ganesha

02:20.800 --> 02:25.120
to karthikeya and now

02:26.160 --> 02:33.680
to christ and from christ

02:29.599 --> 02:35.920
to nishkalaka in the form of nishkalanka

02:33.680 --> 02:36.959
he is innocent so he there's no kalanka

02:35.920 --> 02:38.640
there's no

02:36.959 --> 02:40.080
spot on him nothing he's absolutely

02:38.640 --> 02:44.000
clean immaculate

02:40.080 --> 02:47.599
plus he's fiery

02:44.000 --> 02:50.640
plus he has all the qualities of

02:47.599 --> 02:54.160
means the 11 qualities or the forces

02:50.640 --> 02:57.200
of shiva which can kill

02:54.160 --> 03:00.640
so he has a capacity to kill

02:57.200 --> 03:03.840
and destroy that is evil

03:00.640 --> 03:07.920
and to give blessings

03:03.840 --> 03:07.920
and courage to his followers

03:08.560 --> 03:12.159
this is the last incarnation which is

03:10.959 --> 03:14.239
called as kalaki

03:12.159 --> 03:16.720
in normal words you call it kalaki is

03:14.239 --> 03:16.720
actually

03:16.800 --> 03:21.040
in the white house so it is the

03:19.680 --> 03:24.640
kartikeya

03:21.040 --> 03:28.080
who sits on the white horse so how

03:24.640 --> 03:31.360
innocence grows within you now is

03:28.080 --> 03:34.879
up to the point of karthikeya

03:31.360 --> 03:37.760
this has been today done on this land

03:34.879 --> 03:38.720
jewish land as you call it where

03:37.760 --> 03:40.640
karthikeya

03:38.720 --> 03:41.920
is to be born within you to be awakened

03:40.640 --> 03:46.000
within you

03:41.920 --> 03:46.000
may god bless you
