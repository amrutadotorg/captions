00:00:07.877 --> 00:00:10.680
Now, in this system yesterday&nbsp;
I was telling you about is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.200
there are three type of channels you can see&nbsp;
clearly – have you talked about that to them?

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.160
No.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.315
Now, these channels are, the first one is, is&nbsp;
the left-side channel, which is called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.260
which supplies to the left-side&nbsp;
sympathetic nervous system&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.240
but in Sanskrit language it&nbsp;
is called as the Ida Nadi.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.540
Also it is called as the Moon channel –&nbsp;
is the left-side, which caters to your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.300
Sub-conscious mind and to&nbsp;
your Collective Sub-conscious.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:54.120
On the right hand side there’s another&nbsp;
area which, we can call it as the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.180
one which nourishes the Right&nbsp;
Sympathetic Nervous System.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.940
This one is for your future.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:16.020
So, we can say that, the left one is&nbsp;
the one, which emits the power of desire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.400
and the right one emits the power of action&nbsp;
through your physical and mental being.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.540
So, we have these two Sympathetic&nbsp;
Nervous Systems within us.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.380
In the center is the&nbsp;
Parasympathetic Nervous System&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.020
which in Sanskrit called as the Sushumna Nadi.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.760
So, the left is the Ida Nadi&nbsp;
which is the Moon channel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:52.800
left, right is the Pingala Nadi which is the Sun’s&nbsp;
channel and the central one is the Sushumna Nadi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:00.060
through which we have now come&nbsp;
to this stage of human awareness.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.840
From Amoeba to this stage we have arrived&nbsp;
through this system of Parasympathetic activity.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.660
And whatever we have achieved&nbsp;
through our evolution,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.680
we can feel it on our Central Nervous System.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:21.420
For example, if you have some dog or a&nbsp;
animal, any, say a horse, it can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.940
pass through any dirty lane – it doesn’t see&nbsp;
the beauty of a building, it just goes through.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.891
But it’s only, a human-being can feel the&nbsp;
filth and the dirt and also the beauty.

00:02:34.891 --> 00:02:38.700
So, in our awareness we have&nbsp;
achieved a lot but still,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.700
there’s something more we have to achieve&nbsp;
and that achievement is, the Absolute Truth.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.600
So far, whatever truth we have, is all relative.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.100
We’re finding this is nice,&nbsp;
somebody says this is very nice,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.600
somebody says that’s very nice – somebody says&nbsp;
Communism is good somebody says Capitalism is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.320
good – somebody says this religion is&nbsp;
good, somebody says that religion is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.700
good – it’s all relative terminology,&nbsp;
there’s nothing Absolute about it.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.853
So, whatever is Absolute, we have to&nbsp;
know on our Central Nervous System.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.520
That’s what is called as bodha in&nbsp;
the Buddha religion and

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:26.100
as vid in the Vedas, also what the early&nbsp;
Christians called themselves as Gnostic.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.827
‘Gna’ the word ‘Gna’ comes&nbsp;
from the word ‘Gnya’, ‘Gnya’.

00:03:29.827 --> 00:03:33.365
Some people call it Gyana,&nbsp;
some people call it Gyan.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.820
So the ‘Gyna’, from the ‘Gyna’ means the one&nbsp;
who has known on the Central Nervous System,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.080
not mentally, not reading something.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.920
It is something that you have to&nbsp;
know on your Central Nervous System.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.620
And what do you have to know,&nbsp;
is the All-Pervading power,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.778
which is described by all the saints,&nbsp;
prophets and all the Incarnations.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:08.624
You have to feel that subtle power&nbsp;
which works out all that is living.

00:04:08.624 --> 00:04:10.680
We cannot explain how it works out.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.440
A little seed sprouts, becomes a big tree&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.940
and the tree bears all so many&nbsp;
seeds which has so many trees.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.160
So the one little seed has all the maps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.660
of all the progeny it is going to&nbsp;
produce – it’s a tremendous thing.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.920
And this Infinity, all that is&nbsp;
built-in, in one little seed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.322 --> 00:04:35.280
is like a, something, is beyond our&nbsp;
imagination, beyond our understanding.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:45.000
In the same way, within us lies this very subtle&nbsp;
system, which works out the last ascent.
