00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:55.680
Merry Christmas and all the blessings for
the next year.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:03.850
Today we are not going to have a very long
puja, but there are certain things which we

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.990
have to understand from the life of Christ.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:30.240
Christ was born in a very poor conditions,
just to show that spirituality can live in

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.240
any circumstances and under any problems.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.000
And He had to face so much opposition from
His own clan.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.600
He was born in a Jew family and that time
the Jews would not accept Him.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.570
But they did not kill Him, that's the main
point, we should understand.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.650
They did not kill Him.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.360
Under no law a multitude can kill.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:06.380
Is the judge, who was a Roman judge from the
Roman Empire who actually ordered His death.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:17.520
It is very difficult to follow His life because
He was absolutely a Divine personality, absolutely.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:25.459
And that's why He - whatever rules and regulations
He has passed for the Christians are really

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.440
very difficult to follow, very difficult.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.680
I don't think very few people are even able
to follow His life.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:43.740
It's very difficult because He said that if
you commit any adultery with your eyes, you

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.450
better take out.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:53.050
You cut your hand if you do any crime with
it.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.720
For Him, the crime was also a very subtle
thing.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.090
Turn your left cheek if somebody slaps you
on the right cheek.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.310
To follow this kind of a difficult, very,
very difficult thing was impossible.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.950
And also He said that you have to do it, not
others.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.210
He lived for such a short time.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.240
He visited India and stayed here.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:30.100
I've read a book about it and I was surprised
that in the Puranas, is written very clearly

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:37.410
in Sanskrit language, which perhaps the writer
didn't understand, and where Shalivanha, My

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:46.820
forefathers, he met Him, and he said to Him
that what is Your name?

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:54.180
He said, "My name is Issa Massih", and I have
come to this country because My country is

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.400
full of melechas.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:02.069
Melecha means Mal ich, those have only tendencies
toward collecting filth.

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.570
So he said, "But what are you doing here?

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.820
You go back to your own country and teach
them the "Nirmala Param Tatwam."

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.840
It's very surprisingly; he used these words
so clearly.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.510
So the whole thing was printed in Sanskrit.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.079
Perhaps the writer never understood what was
in Sanskrit language.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.360
And then he said, "It is - You can only go
and reform them and You can clear them."

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:33.940
But look at it, He tried to do the good and
people crucified him.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:41.770
If you see the Christian religion now, you
don't know what to say about it.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:49.009
They have been always opposing Sahaja Yoga
and also they have never tried to understand

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:53.310
that Christ has said that I will send you
the Holy Ghost.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.680
Also, some Sahaja Yogis who are supposed to
be coming from Christian conditionings stick

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.680
to that.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.680
Now no more.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.719
There is no Christ.

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:09.569
Of course, we accept that it was very important
for Him to come on this Earth and to help

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:10.569
us out.

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:14.740
The steps on which you are, you have to leave
that step to go out to the higher stage.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.500
That doesn't mean you should not worship Christ.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:24.580
You should worship, but it is not the way
some people are still very much fond of sticking

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.509
on to it.

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:41.800
while He is the one who prepared you for Sahaja
Yoga.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.831
I don't know what you can adapt from His life.

00:05:43.831 --> 00:05:52.659
He was the greatest Sahaja Yogi, but He had
so many powers, which are difficult for human

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:54.289
beings to have.

00:05:54.289 --> 00:06:05.069
But His sacrifices, His adjustments, acceptance
of whatever was told to Him, He accepted.

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:13.599
His love for His Mother and on the cross He
said, "Behold the Mother!", He just said,

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:15.469
"Behold the Mother."

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:22.169
Whatever it is, we have to know also that
the Bible is not completely representing Christ,

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:26.699
as it has happened with every book.

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:35.680
So, there are problems and, as in every religion,
people have gone astray from their right path,

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:41.479
and are spoiling the name of the people who
have been Divine and who started those religions.

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:44.099
Also is happened in the Christian nation.

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:49.979
Just the opposite of what Christ has said,
they are doing.

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:59.780
For us, one has to realize that He came on
this Earth to open our Agnya chakra, which

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.500
is a very difficult thing.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.360
Sahasrara is not difficult as Agnya.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:12.449
Agnya chakra is a very constricted chakra
on which He resides.

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:21.900
And He has said, "You have to forgive yourself
and forgive others."

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:34.939
This is the mantra of the Agnya chakra.

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:40.569
That is in the Beejakshara we call it "Ham
Sham."

00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:43.469
Sham is to forgive others.

00:07:43.469 --> 00:07:46.520
Ham is to forgive yourself.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.590
These are the two Beejaksharas are used for
Agnya chakra opening.

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.940
To open the Agnya chakra best is to go into
thoughtless awareness.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.780
To be in thoughtless awareness, Agnya can
open.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:02.879
But Agnya, if it is closed, it can be very
dangerous, very dangerous, and can harm you

00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:04.229
or harm others.

00:08:04.229 --> 00:08:11.180
Sometimes, people who are possessed also get
those possessions in their Agnya chakra and

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:19.870
they'll start acting according to the mutation
of these horrible, evil forces within them.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:26.070
As a result, these evil forces take over and
we don't know why such a person is behaving

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:27.389
in this manner.

00:08:27.389 --> 00:08:36.280
Now, as we know that in America they have
been doing lots of research, this this genes.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:41.010
They're talking about so many things, which
they never talked about.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:47.529
Despite that, all the horrible, terrible diseases
are coming back with vengeance.

00:08:47.529 --> 00:08:50.630
They can't understand why it is happening.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:56.860
With all this research, with all this work,
people are getting very sick and it is beyond

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.170
them to understand why these things are happening.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:07.000
The main thing is, you have to be under the
protection of spirituality, under the protection

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.700
of morality, under the protection of Divine
Laws.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:18.650
If you're not under that protection, you can
get caught up into anything.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:24.750
America especially, I find, is gone really
amuck as far as religion is concerned.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:30.150
They have all kinds of religions, they have
even religions of the devil, religions of

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.870
the witchcraft.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:35.020
Every sort of religion they have.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:40.640
Though they have advanced so much in science,
they are living in terror all the time.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:50.170
Firstly, one must accept, that morality is
what Christ has taught us, of a very deep

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:52.220
essential nature, very deep.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.450
He said, "Thou shall not have adulterous eyes."

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:56.150
Even in the eyes, there should not be adultery.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:59.350
You look at one woman, all right.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:06.020
Second time, if you look at that woman, then
you are adulterous.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:12.960
Such strict rules he has passed about his
own idea of a moral personality.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:22.840
Now, as you are Sahaja Yogis, you are already
quite equipped, you are quite equipped and

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:27.260
you can follow His principles easily than
other people can.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:34.340
But still, some things I have to tell you,
as Christ has said that I will tolerate everything

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:43.630
against Me, but nothing against 
the Holy Ghost.

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.540
It's very remarkable thing to say.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:50.590
He's the Ocean of Forgiveness, and there He
says, "Everything I'll tolerate, but nothing

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:54.490
against the Holy Ghost."

00:10:54.490 --> 00:11:04.460
So many things are happening, So many things
are happening, which amazes people.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:13.660
For example, here only, in Ganapatipule, there
was one funny fellow who came up with some

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:18.130
sort of a opposition to Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:27.631
And he got hold of the village man called
as the Mamlatdar, means he's an officer and

00:11:27.631 --> 00:11:31.950
both of them combined together started troubling
us.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:36.430
Just before our coming ten days, this Mamlatdar
was suspended.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:38.040
Nobody could understand.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.980
How was he suspended suddenly?

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:41.980
How?

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:42.980
What happened?

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:49.220
Like that - is this is Christ, is His work,
Ganesha's work.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:53.480
Left and right, so many people - I, I am not
bothered about it.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.700
I don't want anybody to be destroyed.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:12:03.910
But it is They, who are trying to destroy
all those who come in the way of Sahaja Yoga

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:09.260
and it is very amazing how things are happening
and how it is working out.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:14.820
So we should have no fear at all, if people
oppose us, they try to do anything.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:20.790
Suddenly, you'll find some solution will come
out and you'll be amazed at it.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:26.350
So many things happen like that and have been
happening all over and I have so many letters

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:34.510
from people saying how they have been helped
by our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:40.720
I don't have to tell them, they know their
job very well.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:48.320
But as Sahaja Yogis, what should we have as
our code of conduct?

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:52.540
It's very important, as they call "Acharsahita."

00:12:52.540 --> 00:13:01.930
The first thing in today's modern Sahaja Yoga,
you have to know that you have to recognize

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:03.870
Me.

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.350
That is very important.

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:11.900
Very humbly, I have to tell you - you have
to recognize Me and you have to respect Me

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.470
and love Me.

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:26.010
If in these words, if I can explain to you,
that you cannot have a double life.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:30.690
You cannot show love and another side you
try to trouble Me.

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:40.160
First thing is that so far there has been
no en-mass realization, no en-mass realization

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:46.870
and when there is no en-mass realization,
we cannot blame the people if they did not

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:53.630
recognize these incarnations, because without
realization, how can they recognize?

00:13:53.630 --> 00:14:03.250
But after en-mass realization, if you do not
recognize, then it's a serious thing.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:07.730
You should not be addicted to your previous
nonsensical stuff that you had.

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:17.970
In the same, same like some, there are Hindus,
if I tell them that now finish with all these

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:25.120
temples and this fasting and all those brahmic
nonsense, they don't like it.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.120
You have to.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.750
Now you have become saints.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:33.030
For saints, there is no caste, no community,
no race.

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:36.880
Anyway, and you tell to anyone, they don't
like it.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.610
If you tell it to Jains, they won't like.

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:43.400
If you tell it to Buddhists, they won't like.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:47.660
They just want to stick on to the old style
which their forefather's, their forefather's,

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.450
forefathers have been doing so far.

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:57.640
So recognition only mean, doesn't mean that
you recognize Me as Adi Shakti, but recognition

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:08.120
means that in every part of your life, you
should know that I am with you.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:16.990
Disciplining in Sahaja Yoga has to be automatic.

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:25.820
I don't have to tell you about disciplining,
but it doesn't work out, then I have to tell

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:26.820
you.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:30.670
The first discipline, is that you have to
recognize Me and respect Me.

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:39.930
Then the second discipline, is you have to
learn how to be a Sahaja Yogi.

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:49.670
Think of Christ, if He is sitting here, how
would He behave towards Me or He would behave

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:52.090
towards others who are here.

00:15:52.090 --> 00:16:00.300
Very difficult for Him to accept all, any
kind of nonsense from anyone.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:04.250
He would not tolerate.

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:05.250
I don't mind many things, I say, "All right.

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:06.250
Gradually it will be solved.

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:09.320
Things will be all right."

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:16.010
But what I find, that still there are so many
Sahaja Yogis who don't really realize the

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:21.000
responsibility that they have.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.620
He carried the cross.

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:26.980
In Sahaja Yoga, you don't have to carry cross.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:33.390
You have to wear only garlands, but you must
be worthy of garlands.

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:36.250
Nobody has to suffer.

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:41.670
Everything is made very well for them, paved
with gold as they say, but only thing you

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:44.620
should know, how to walk on them.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:54.090
So the second point, as I said, that you should
not have a double personality.

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:56.310
Single dedication.

00:16:56.310 --> 00:17:05.919
You need not be twenty-four hours in it, you
have your own families, your own children,

00:17:05.919 --> 00:17:07.640
you have own your life.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:15.189
With that, you have to be all the time connected,
but not to get so much involved, that you

00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:18.159
harm the collectivity of Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:18.159 --> 00:17:26.319
Your relations - brothers, sisters, mother,
father, they're all right, but your main responsibility

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:27.620
is Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:33.540
Instead of that, you get involved into these
things, you will definitely harm the collectivity

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:39.460
of Sahaja Yoga and create a politics out of
it.

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:47.050
The second discipline, is that your relationship
is only with Sahaja Yogis and with nobody

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:49.460
else.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:52.870
This is very important.

00:17:52.870 --> 00:18:02.180
This is what I have to tell you very clearly
that nobody is important but Sahaja Yogis.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:08.690
Of course, you have to meet others, you have
to talk to others, you have to deal with them,

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:12.370
you have to bring them to Sahaja Yoga, that
is there, no doubt.

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:15.620
But, you cannot let down a Sahaja Yogi.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:25.290
Among yourself if you have differences, sort
them out and when you are outside, then you

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:27.910
should appear as one.

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:30.940
If you know the truth, there should be no
differences.

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:32.480
Why should there be differences?

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:37.920
If there are differences, then you should
find out that something is wrong with you,

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:43.440
definitely, and what is, is wrong is, that
you are self-centered or you're worried about

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:50.220
something, which is, which is not Sahaja.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:56.940
Even to follow my example may be difficult.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:00.710
Now I have My children and My grandchildren,
I never telephone to them, never.

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:07.809
As it is, I never telephone to them.

00:19:07.809 --> 00:19:11.230
I am never bothered.

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:15.630
I see my husband so much worried about them,
always telephones them.

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:17.240
I never.

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:21.210
Firstly, I know they are all right.

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:34.420
Firstly, I know I've done my duty, and I'm
not going to waste My life only on My children

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:42.830
or on My husband or on My family because My
family is the whole universe.

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:45.720
So you have to expand.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.020
Sahaja Yogis have to expand themselves.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:56.230
If they're just interested in their own family,
in their own children, in their own properties,

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:58.430
is going to be difficult.

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:01.760
So this self-centeredness has to go.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:10.490
This self-centeredness has to go completely
and you have to have a very wider vision of

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:17.610
life.

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:39.640
This is a very big compulsion for us, as Sahaja
Yogis that we belong to the family of the

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.370
universe.

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:47.060
So, just like in the marriages now.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:54.130
We started saying, "I don't like, I don't
want to marry an Indian."

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:57.160
Some Indians say, "I don't want to marry a
foreigner."

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:03.850
If you are so small-minded, you should not
ask for marriage.

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:13.190
You should not ask me that I should marry
you because we have to transcend completely,

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:18.660
all these petty ideas about our own religion,
about our own race, about our own country.

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:25.000
If you cannot do it, you are not a Sahaja
Yogi.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.880
From your heart, you must expand.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.000
That is very important.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:43.340
Thus, the problem in India is of, say, caste
system, which is - I can't understand.

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:50.040
I've told hundred times that in the Gita,
it's described that in everybody resides the

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.040
spirit.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.559
So how can you have caste?

00:21:52.559 --> 00:21:58.040
But you can have according to your aptitude,
that's different.

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:02.730
But you cannot have caste according to birth.

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:09.670
There's so many examples to prove that, but
in India we have this curse of caste system.

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:13.550
And in the West, is even worse, is the racialism.

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:18.080
It is such a horrible thing called racialism.

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:25.640
For example, I went to Romania and I saw so
many Gypsies there.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.680
They're treated just like dogs.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.790
So low they were looked upon.

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:35.670
These Gypsies are really nice people, nothing
wrong with them.

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:39.800
At least their character is good.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:50.040
They have certain principle for their women
and they lead a good life of morality.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:58.700
They are collective people, but they are treated
so badly, so shabbily, that even in India,

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:04.240
I won't find that kind of a thing happening.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.240
Racialism.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:09.900
Now, Romanians have no particular race, as
such.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:18.220
You cannot say they are Germans or English
or Anglo-Saxons, nothing.

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:20.970
I was surprised there more than anywhere else.

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:24.340
Also in England, the same thing.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:31.270
They are treated very badly and these are
people of great art and very loving.

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:37.160
And I was surprised that so many came to our
program also.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:45.550
So the attention should be on a wider vision
of life and towards the people who are suffering,

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:48.890
is very important.

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:57.171
You must look after the people who are suffering,
who are in trouble, who need your help, not

00:23:57.171 --> 00:24:04.800
to make friends with people who will help
you in money or in any other way but be friendly

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.630
with the people who are downtrodden.

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:12.590
We have become Sahaja Yogis to help them to
come up.

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:21.630
We have to do something for them and in Vashi
I'm starting a center where the poor people

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:26.660
will be treated free.

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:36.750
Though we are in the middle, we have to help
the people who are not enjoying any benefit

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:37.980
of life.

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:44.480
We have to take them to Sahaja Yoga, We have
to help them in every way that is possible.

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:52.340
Now, you must have noticed that in the wedding
lists, what I have done is to create a balance

00:24:52.340 --> 00:25:00.170
between, say, the developing countries and
the developed countries, to make an proper

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:01.890
exchange.

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:09.140
Then I find there are people who are very
arrogant about it.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:15.049
Now, English girls are supposed to be Christians,
French girls are supposed to be Christians

00:25:15.049 --> 00:25:16.450
and so many others.

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:22.210
Christ, who did so much for the downtrodden,
these people, when they get married, they

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:29.429
try to show off and look down upon people,
they are Sahaja Yogis and now we have turned

00:25:29.429 --> 00:25:33.600
down all the Christian girls from England
because for the same reason.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:44.090
A funny type of a superiority complex if you
develop, that's not being Christian at all.

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:48.910
And that's why we have to understand, as Sahaja
Yogis, that the one of the principle of Sahaja

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:56.860
Yoga is that you should get over all these
minor things and all these limitations from

00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:07.110
which we have been suffering and others have
been suffering.

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:13.679
When we come to this collective happening,
we have to understand that people have to

00:26:13.679 --> 00:26:17.809
be collective.

00:26:17.809 --> 00:26:23.130
Because we should have big palaces where we
can go and meditate or should we have huge

00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:24.130
things?

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:25.380
Not necessary.

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:31.940
To pray and to meditate, any place is all
right.

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.890
Anywhere you are there, you can enjoy, you
should enjoy there.

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:38.170
You should not demand things.

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:42.760
Like when you come to Ganapatipule, I know
it's not very comfortable.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:52.490
It's not even a three star hotel arrangement,
but you enjoy each other and you love each

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:59.590
other, and the company of every one of you
is the comfort giving.

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:12.059
What gives you comfort is the love, affection,
oneness, the unity between yourself.

00:27:12.059 --> 00:27:17.530
Then you don't care, you don't care what comforts
you have, what happiness you have.

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:26.530
This time, suddenly, you know, there were
250 more came than expected, so we had to

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:32.210
put the, these temporary things for you and
you didn't mind.

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:36.510
I am very thankful to you for that.

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:44.460
So complete tolerance and comfort of the body
is not important - comfort of the spirit.

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:53.130
If your body wants comfort, you try to make
it learn to give up that.

00:27:53.130 --> 00:28:05.520
Try to make your body your slave and not you
the slave of the body.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:08.610
This if you don't try, then in Sahaja Yoga,
you are nowhere because then you will again

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:17.390
say, "I must have a beautiful car, then must
I have a house, then I must have this, must

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:18.390
have that."

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:27.419
If you care for your body too much, then the
spirit, the light of the spirit goes down.

00:28:27.419 --> 00:28:36.370
There's no glow on your face and there's no
peace in your mind because, all the time,

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:40.650
you're worried about your body, about your
comforts, about your food, about this, about

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:41.650
that.

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:51.309
You can leave all these things to the Divine.

00:28:51.309 --> 00:28:57.250
What you have to do to see yourself, that
in your behavior, you should be honest, you

00:28:57.250 --> 00:29:01.559
should be spiritual and you should be surrendering.

00:29:01.559 --> 00:29:03.470
That's your job.

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:06.950
You have to see, "Am I surrendering or not?

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:11.169
Am I fully with Sahaja Yoga or not?

00:29:11.169 --> 00:29:13.580
What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:15.790
What I should do for Sahaja Yoga?"

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:19.110
If you don't do this way, the mind will work
the other way round.

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:22.929
It will start thinking, "Oh, this is not good
for my child.

00:29:22.929 --> 00:29:24.080
That's not good.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.220
This is this."

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:27.870
Once you start thinking what have I to do
for Sahaja Yoga?

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:29.810
What have I to work out for Sahaja Yoga?

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:36.510
How I have to spread Sahaja Yoga?, you'll
be surprised your mind will get into the aura

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:45.840
of spirituality and nobody has to tell you
anything, it will just work automatically.

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:52.470
You have the power, you have everything, you
have the fountain, which has to be opened

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:53.470
out.

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:58.140
So we come to another point that we should
realize what we are.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:02.110
This is very important for Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:05.500
Christ has said, "I am the Son of God."

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:06.500
All right.

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:16.440
He said it openly, though people crucified
Him for that, but He said it.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:22.900
He said it openly, "I am the Son of God.

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:24.220
Do what you like."

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:27.670
Which was a fact, which was the truth He was
supposed to say.

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:36.410
So now, the Sahaj Yogis have to say, "I am
the son or daughter of Adi Shakti."

00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:48.919
Once you say to yourself that, suddenly you'll
start changing because it's a very big position.

00:30:48.919 --> 00:30:55.520
It's a very anointed position.

00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:01.240
Once you start saying that, then you'll start
understanding what is your responsibility.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.590
You'll be amazed.

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:09.919
Those people have been to wrong gurus, when
they come to Sahaja Yoga, they become extremely

00:31:09.919 --> 00:31:15.770
generous and extremely dedicated, extremely
humble because they have suffered so much.

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:23.340
Sometimes, those who come directly do not
have that feeling.

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:27.980
What you have got, you know better when you
have gone through some ordeals, but if you

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:31.680
get it Sahaja, then they don't understand.

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:38.450
So, we have to also introspect all the time.

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:47.570
The first introspection is that, Am I humble?

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:54.070
Can I humble down myself before anyone?

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:59.299
That's very important, but temper is the worst
thing.

00:31:59.299 --> 00:32:03.890
Krishna has said, "From the temper, everything
bad starts."

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:09.230
Temper starts from liver; so you can cure
your liver.

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:16.480
But temper you can see yourself, how your
temper is bad and how you want to get rid

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.240
of the temper.

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.030
Temper will kill all the collectivity.

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:23.970
Temper will blur all the beauty of spirituality.

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:35.630
A person who is very hot tempered and talks
of God, people will say, "Let's run away from

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:36.630
this man."

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:39.620
So the temper you have to get rid of.

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:46.620
It's very important to introspect on what
points you get angry.

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:49.580
Some people think it's a matter of right for
them to get angry.

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:56.269
All right, but not in Sahaj Yoga.

00:32:56.269 --> 00:32:58.260
You don't have to get angry.

00:32:58.260 --> 00:32:59.280
You don't have to shout at anyone.

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:02.940
You don't have to beat anyone.

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:04.940
If there is any problem, you can tell Me.

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:12.799
But I have seen people fighting, quarrelling
sometime and I'm amazed how these people are

00:33:12.799 --> 00:33:14.780
quarrelling among themselves.

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:22.610
Gradually, I'm sure, as you'll grow in spirituality,
all these fights and quarrels and what you

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:27.660
call the different grouping ideas will drop
out.

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:35.680
But Sahaja Yoga will not allow you to stay
in it.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.270
You'll be exposed immediately.

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:39.260
People will know about you.

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:47.549
So try to understand why you get angry, why
you have temper, what is the reason, what

00:33:47.549 --> 00:33:50.770
you don't like in other people may be within
you.

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:54.049
Same thing may be existing within you.

00:33:54.049 --> 00:34:00.570
So, is a cleansing process in Sahaja Yoga,
which is very important and we need the help

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:03.380
of Christ very much.

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:09.079
Because there is rationality that covers your
Agnya.

00:34:09.079 --> 00:34:12.109
You can rationalize everything.

00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:13.109
Everything.

00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:18.359
Even if you kill somebody, you can rationalize
it.

00:34:18.359 --> 00:34:24.830
So this Agnya is also our enemy if we cannot
keep it open.

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:25.830
Absolutely.

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:28.409
Because we can justify ourself.

00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:32.590
We can say, "What can I do?

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:37.030
It happened like that and this thing."

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:42.599
Once you start, get after yourself; all these
things will go away.

00:34:42.599 --> 00:34:50.950
If you're getting angry very much, stand before
the mirror and try to get angry with yourself.

00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:56.780
Then attachments.

00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:01.710
Attachments are very subtle.

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:07.280
Formerly, what I had known about the western
Sahaja Yogis, they didn't love their children

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:08.490
very well.

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:09.835
Now, I find they're glued to their children.

00:35:09.835 --> 00:35:17.890
And they want to move the whole movement of
Sahaja Yoga according to the whims of their

00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:18.910
children.

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:26.020
Also, Indian Sahaja Yogis are like that.

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:28.300
They're very attached to their children.

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:33.230
They are, they have been always very attached
to their children.

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:37.780
I've already explained to you that attachment
is the death of love.

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:44.520
If you love somebody, then love everyone according
to the need of that person.

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:45.590
You have to move.

00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:48.520
You cannot just stick into one point.

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:51.950
That is not your responsibility.

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:58.869
That is the responsibility of the Divine and
leave it to Divine and you will see.

00:35:58.869 --> 00:36:03.849
Your children will improve, your relationships
will improve, everything will improve because

00:36:03.849 --> 00:36:06.670
it's not your responsibility.

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:18.470
Your limitations will affect all these relations
and I should actually say that this limited

00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:22.790
relationship will, might, also suffocate the
relations.

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:34.660
So I have a very wider vision and a wider
understanding how far you are.

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:40.460
If you come in the nature, you can learn it
very well.

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:41.650
See the water.

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:43.300
It's coming to all the trees.

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:44.300
Everyone is blessed.

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:47.180
It doesn't stick to any, any one tree or anywhere.

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:52.180
If it does that, the whole thing will be finished.

00:36:52.180 --> 00:37:01.940
If you have to think of collectivity, you
have to be very much detached and not driven

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:12.550
or persuaded into some sort of a small little
relationships.

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:20.430
It's much easier for you to follow Sahaja
Yoga than anybody else in the world could

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:27.270
have followed because others were not realized
souls.

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:34.599
You are all realized souls.

00:37:34.599 --> 00:37:42.000
There are other attachments - attachments
to money.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:54.450
Very surprising, like they treat Sahaja Yoga
sometimes like a shop or a market.

00:37:54.450 --> 00:38:01.260
So they'll say, "Mother, can You make it half
rate?

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:03.619
Can You make it quarter rate?

00:38:03.619 --> 00:38:08.130
Can You give us some concession?

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:11.580
Some sale, you know."

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:16.920
There are at least thirty-five percent people
are coming free.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:28.550
And those who can pay want to have half, less
than half, but I don't know what to say to

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:29.550
them.

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:37.470
I mean this is the only chance where you can
really give some money, which is, of course,

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:38.859
shared, I agree.

00:38:38.859 --> 00:38:44.410
It's not all that money is needed for one
person, but you can share, very easily with

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:48.940
others, because they don't have that much
money to come to this country, they don't

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:51.770
have that much money to live here.

00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:58.840
As we are talking about global life, we have
to understand that we have to share money

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:00.000
with them.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.580
If you start understanding only this much,
I tell you, your attachment to money will

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:05.580
go away.

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:11.290
That you have to share.

00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:12.430
You don't want to share anything.

00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:16.670
You may have crores, but you don't want to
share.

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:23.770
In Sahaja Yoga, so many people have become
very rich, but they don't want to share.

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:28.500
I'm not saying that we are here for money
or anything, but main point is, fundamental

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:33.880
point, is the attitude should be of sharing
with others.

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:36.970
Sahaja Yoga has given us so much.

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:40.349
What have we done for it?

00:39:40.349 --> 00:39:43.380
Where are we sharing?

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:49.580
On the other side, we have people who are
very - very greedy who want more.

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:56.530
There are some people who go on borrowing
money, some people who go on using people

00:39:56.530 --> 00:40:00.850
for their own purposes.

00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:05.580
All these petty, nonsensical things are not
for Sahaja Yogis.

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:06.580
You don't need.

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:10.480
Whatever you need, you just ask, you'll get
it.

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:17.720
So some people are trying to exploit some
people and some people are trying to save

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.240
themselves.

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:24.360
There should be an open mind.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:33.010
As your Sahasrara is open here - you know,
this is the Heart Chakra here and this Heart

00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:36.820
Chakra opens, then the Sahasrara opens.

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:44.000
Open your hearts, open your hearts, then only
you can enjoy yourself.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.599
Now supposing I want to see something with
My eyes and My eyes are closed, can I see

00:40:49.599 --> 00:40:51.599
something and enjoy that?

00:40:51.599 --> 00:40:56.869
If you have to feel something from your heart,
your heart is closed, how can you?

00:40:56.869 --> 00:41:02.840
How can you feel that?

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:04.980
So open your heart.

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:07.240
Open your heart.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:16.080
In this way, you'll realize that things are
not so difficult.

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:21.090
It's all for us very easy, but we have to
open our heart and respect each other.

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:25.940
Sahaja Yogis must respect each other.

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:35.280
Somebody is black, somebody is white, somebody
is tall, somebody is short, somebody is like

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.280
that.

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:42.030
God has made a variety otherwise we would
all have been like a regimentation.

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:50.140
So we should enjoy the variety that makes
the beauty, beauty of creation.

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:57.940
So all these outward things should not in
any way impress you.

00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:05.880
People should be clean, neat, tidy - that's
different.

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:09.520
But everybody should be like you is wrong.

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:18.030
In India especially, if you speak English
not very correctly, then he is condemned,

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:23.890
as a scheduled caste.

00:42:23.890 --> 00:42:27.560
It's such slavish mentality, very slavish.

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:31.880
Whether you know your language or not, your
mother tongue or not, Hindi or not, doesn't

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:32.880
matter.

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:33.880
You must know English.

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.369
If somebody says "English", he is finished.

00:42:35.369 --> 00:42:47.470
Well, I have seen Japanese, Chinese, French,
anyone else speaks horrible, I mean funny

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:57.970
English, I should say, but the worst are the
English themselves.

00:42:57.970 --> 00:43:03.600
English have lost the sense of English completely,
but what's so much in that?

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:10.540
It's nothing but a slavish mentality to one
regime, which was here for three hundred years

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:21.349
and did nothing good to themselves, went empty
handed from here.

00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:25.890
Even the Christians in India believe that
Christ was born in England, do you believe

00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:26.890
that?

00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:27.890
Most of them.

00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:41.220
So the essence of a life is to be proud of
whatever country we are born of, we must love

00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:46.920
our own country, but we should not identify
with it.

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:50.930
All the wrongs of that country we should criticize
and we should see.

00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:56.420
We should not accept them and should not become
a part and parcel of those absurd people who

00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:58.599
have their limitations.

00:43:58.599 --> 00:44:02.240
Do you transcend your countries?

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:05.890
You transcend all these limitations.

00:44:05.890 --> 00:44:08.440
You have become great now.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:12.480
How can you remain in a small little pond?

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:13.480
You need an ocean.

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:15.190
You'll get suffocated.

00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:28.510
Another thing is, you should not use things
made by machine so much.

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:33.770
Try to avoid, as far as possible.

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:37.520
These machines have created so many problems
for us.

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:46.690
We should wear something that is made by hand
or by people who are using small, little,

00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:53.560
sort of, we can call, ordinary machines, which
does not require so much of smoke to come

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:54.580
out.

00:44:54.580 --> 00:45:00.099
We should be very conscious of ecological
problems as Sahaja Yogis.

00:45:00.099 --> 00:45:06.010
But one thing I know, where there are Sahaja
Yogis the ecological problems also gets solved

00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:08.700
because of vibrations.

00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:12.760
But vibrations will only fight when you are
willing to fight ecology.

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:21.060
Everywhere you go, you find so much of pollution,
so much of pollution.

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:24.750
How to fight this pollution?

00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:31.330
Is to be paying attention to the ecology.

00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:34.140
Are we producing all those things, which is
spoiling the atmosphere?

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:38.470
We are responsible, we have to do it.

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:44.660
Who is going to do it?

00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:52.580
So one side, as I told you, we have to look
after the people who are poorer than us, who

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:53.580
are unfortunate.

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:59.451
We have to look after the atmosphere which
is filled with all nonsensical things and

00:45:59.451 --> 00:46:11.170
take to a lifestyle, which lifestyle will
be simpler, by which we don't use so many,

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:18.070
so many vehicles and so many things which
are creating problems.

00:46:18.070 --> 00:46:25.200
Like in Dehra Dhun they told me they have
so many of these three-wheelers that the buses

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.200
have stopped.

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.200
Why?

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:32.290
Because in the three-wheeler you pay some
money less, so they go by the three-wheeler

00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:39.330
and it creates all the black soot all over.

00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:42.750
A Sahaja Yogi should never sit in a three-wheeler
to save some money.

00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:50.160
It's better to walk or use a vehicle which
doesn't give much of these things.

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:59.339
They are so many ways by which we can really
be very supportive of this ecological problem

00:46:59.339 --> 00:47:02.839
because it is a part of our, part of our responsibility.

00:47:02.839 --> 00:47:16.640
Till the age of forty-seven, I was wearing
only pure khadi, pure khadi, not even silk,

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:20.220
till the age of forty-seven.

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:28.530
Then when this Sahasrara was broken, then
I started wearing other clothes.

00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:35.730
Our life should be such that we should feel
sensitive to every growth around us.

00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:43.060
It is only our attention, how you put your
attention to things.

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:50.570
Like now, there are so many new things are
coming up in India, everywhere.

00:47:50.570 --> 00:48:00.140
One day, I told somebody that why didn't you
get some quails from Germany?

00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:01.570
He said, "I don't know.

00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:02.570
There is quail in Germany?"

00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:03.570
I said, "There is a big industry of quails.

00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:04.570
What do you say?"

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:06.560
"How do you know, Mother?"

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:08.470
I said, "I know."

00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:16.070
Once I go to a country, I know everything
about that, all the details about it.

00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:23.780
I was surprised that such a big industry they
had, they never knew they had quails.

00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:28.670
In the same way, in our own country, we don't
know what we have, what artistic things we

00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:34.589
have, what is, what is the one that is, that
will help the poor.

00:48:34.589 --> 00:48:38.700
We never know about it.

00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:49.280
Why Christ was born in those conditions because
He wanted to give blessings to those poor

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:53.849
people, to help them with spirituality.

00:48:53.849 --> 00:48:58.620
But we are not bothered, we are not bothered
to see where the poverty is and how we can

00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:00.930
help.

00:49:00.930 --> 00:49:07.630
You can, by all means, you can help them in
every corner, in every way.

00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:15.410
It's very simple to understand about your
own country, where the problem is, why people

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:20.560
are poor and we cannot help them.

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:23.109
We have to take to this.

00:49:23.109 --> 00:49:28.829
Unless and until your light shines in the
society, we are doing nothing.

00:49:28.829 --> 00:49:34.230
We are just enjoying our own Sahaja Yoga,
Ganapatipule and all that.

00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:36.360
But what about others?

00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:43.720
So sensitivity to art, sensitivity to music,
sensitivity to all creative things that are

00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:52.300
there and what can we do with these creative
things for others.

00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:58.060
The attention should be more towards these
things than about useless things.

00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:00.420
Politics you shouldn't worry so much.

00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:03.450
It will be all exposed and finished and it
will be alright.

00:50:03.450 --> 00:50:05.940
Let them fight, let them do what they like.

00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:09.380
They're stupid people.

00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:18.170
Your attention should be how you can be creative,
how you can help people, how what you can

00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:19.170
do.

00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:28.260
In everything there's one thing - is Love,
what you call is compassion, Anukampa, just

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:34.820
out of love and affection and that should
be an real innate expression of every Sahaja

00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:37.680
Yogi in every field of life.

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:41.420
I don't like this, I don't like that, this
kind of a person is never a Sahaja Yogi.

00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:45.470
The one who says, "I like."

00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:52.190
My throat was not all right, but somebody
brought some fruit.

00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:56.660
Just to please, I ate it.

00:50:56.660 --> 00:51:03.360
Doesn't matter what, little bit, I did eat.

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:07.710
Just to please you, I wore such a heavy saree.

00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:13.190
None of you can wear it, I can tell you.

00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:14.300
Just to please you.

00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:16.079
So what are we doing to please others?

00:51:16.079 --> 00:51:17.500
You should be a pleasing personality.

00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:22.350
Instead of thinking about how you should be
pleased, I don't like this, I don't do like

00:51:22.350 --> 00:51:26.280
that, instead of, what have I done to please
others?

00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:38.849
To please the Divine, our character, our behavior
should be absolutely clean.

00:51:38.849 --> 00:51:44.280
I know Sahaja Yogis have done wonders and
they are doing very well, but they can do

00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:46.470
much, much, much more than what they are doing.

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:53.480
So on this day of Christ's birthday, I have
to tell you that it is not possible to follow

00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:55.150
His life, I agree.

00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:56.150
Very difficult.

00:51:56.150 --> 00:52:05.910
But at least, one has to learn from Him that
He is before us and let us try to go forward

00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:13.050
towards Him, in His simplicity, in His honesty
and the sacrifices He could make.

00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:15.050
May God bless you.
