00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.400
Today is a very

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.240
joyous that all of us are here in Turkey,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:18.400
to celebrate the Puja of Fatima.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.360
As you know about Her that She was the daughter

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.680
of Mohammed Sahib and was married to Ali,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.640
and She had two children, Hassan and Hussein,

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.400
who were ultimately killed in Karbala

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.080
by the fanatics,

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.280
who were that time called themselves Sunnis.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:07.440
All this happened because there were fanaticism,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.000
and the fanaticism

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.200
that makes person thinks always

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.720
that they are on the right

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.720
and they have every right to be

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.360
angry, to persuade, to convince another party,

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.240
another person.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.000
And these fanaticisms grew

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.240
since long – it’s not a new thing.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.440
It is so obvious now that our main problem

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.480
in this world is of fanaticism.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.680
Fatima lost Her two children,

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.760
and She was the embodiment of

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.160
Gruha Lakshmi.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.280
She resides in our Left Nabhi.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.360
So for all the diseases that are connected with the spleen,

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.800
all the problems that are connected with your Left Nabhi

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.440
can be only corrected by Fatima.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.600
So you have to keep Fatima awakened within yourself.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.400
That we are here in the Islamic culture,

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.280
we can say, this is place of Islamic culture;

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.720
and in the Islamic culture a housewife was given

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.120
a very, very important place.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.000
At the time of Mohammed Sahib

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.120
there were struggles and fights

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.760
and wars going on between different tribes.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.720
As a result many, many

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.720
young men were killed.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.480
Only quite old people survived,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.040
and also so many women.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.920
This is the reason why Mohammed said that

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.160
“You can marry four wives, five wives;

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.160
but you cannot allow them to remain

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.840
unmarried or they will have extramarital relationships.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.400
That will be the greatest fall for Islam,

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.760
for that religion.”

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.800
So He understood that unless and until

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
women are kept absolutely chaste,

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.000
absolutely pure,

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.960
there cannot be the Kingdom of God.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.720
In Sanskrit there’s a saying,

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.440
“Yatra narya pujyante, tatra ramante devata”:

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.360
meaning “Where the women are respected,

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.840
are worshipped and they are worshipful” –

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.080
not that they are to be worshipped,

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.120
but they are respectable –

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.520
“there only exists the Kingdom of God.”

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.200
So, so much responsibility is on women.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.400
So from Fatima’s life we have to know that

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.440
She did not go out of Her house

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.120
and She remained a housewife,

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.760
and She made Her two children grow up

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.080
in such a manner that they had to fight the war

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.720
against fanaticism.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.800
Her husband also was there.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.960
This is how a woman of a housewife

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.760
is shown to be so powerful that though

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.400
she’s in the house, though she’s –

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.440
looks to be just a mother,

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.240
but how powerful she is.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.480
But these days a new type of ideas have come up.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.160
Men also have been very nasty

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.120
and very aggressive with women.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.480
As a result we find there’s a big

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.720
opposition to men,

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.480
and a kind of a big rift has been created

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.680
between men and women.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.760
Also the men, the way they started becoming licentious,

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.400
perverted,

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.360
going to bad women,

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.280
the good women also thought,

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.160
“Why not we also become like that?”

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.120
and they also started doing wrong things

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.720
which they should not have done.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.240
That’s how the whole society crumbled down.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.120
Now, the men are responsible for the politics and the economics

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.640
and also the nation, as administrators,

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.680
but women are responsible for the society.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.880
Whether she’s in the house or she’s outside,

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.520
whether she’s working in the house or outside,

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.080
she is responsible for

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.280
the maintenance of the society.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.640
And there it looks as, sometimes to a woman,

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.160
that she’s dominated,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.160
that her husband dominates her,

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.080
that the husband’s family dominates her,

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.840
but it’s the quality of a woman

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.800
that brings up the level of the society.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.240
Not only the level,

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.600
but also in the family she is then respected.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.480
It’s a very important role as a housewife;

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.360
perhaps we never realize it.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.960
Now we see so many lights here,

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.760
electricity is there running.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.680
But what is the source of this electricity?

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.280
Is it not much more important than these lights?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.960
So men are nothing but, we can say, the kinetic energy,

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.920
but what is the potential is the woman of the house.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.640
But these days it’s becoming a very funny situation.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.680
I was surprised when I went to

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.280
Italy also, that

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.400
how women have made themself cheap.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.520
And they want to look attractive to every man.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.960
What is the need?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.800
It’s a joyless pursuit into which men are going,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.160
and women are making themselves absolutely cheap.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.840
This cheapness of women

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.760
is not going to give them any strength or joy.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.720
I know one feels very unhappy

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.400
the way men treat them.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.280
But you must have your own personality,

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.920
you must have your own understanding

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.000
that you are a woman, you are shakti,

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.400
and nobody can suppress the shakti.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:57.760
But if you do not keep to your own

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.120
personality or your chastity,

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.680
then you cannot achieve

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.200
your goal in life.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:12.600
And your goal in life is to give power to your son,

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.960
to your husband,

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.240
to all the society the woman gives power.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.480
I am also a woman, as you know,

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.400
and I also have a family.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.160
With all the powers that I have,

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:32.800
I never showed them that I have those powers.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.320
I always listened to My husband, obeyed him

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.720
though sometimes he was very unreasonable also.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.040
And he also came from a society

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.680
which was more Islamic-oriented.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.240
But that was just a joke for Me,

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.240
because I thought

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.200
“He’s just like a child

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.920
and I have to be

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.320
very patient with him.”

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.600
He always says that because of My powers

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.480
he earned everything in life.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.360
Always, in the presence of everyone he says so.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.920
I don’t know that part, but definitely

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.640
I feel very satisfied with My own married life.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.400
I never think the way other people think

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.720
that we must try to dominate the husband,

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.400
we must fight him, we must have a right to do this.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.640
Our right is within ourselves, within our powers.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:38.320
Also the men must realize that they have to respect women.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.800
I mean, not to such an extent that she tells you

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.120
to do something wrong,

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.800
and you just get lost with this – that’s not the way.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.080
That’s slavishness.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.520
Men have to be men.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.160
It in no way means the women are dominated by men.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.240
I do not say it that way;

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.960
because if you have your own powers,

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.920
ultimately whatever may be the husband,

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.840
he’ll have to come and

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.200
understand what you want.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.360
He’ll have to know what you are.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.440
I have seen it many-a-times in My own lifetime

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.640
that it has done that way.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.160
I would never say anything.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.080
Supposing he gets angry, I would keep quiet.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.920
All right.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.960
After all he has to fight outside

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.120
and he has to take out temper on Me

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.440
that he couldn’t do:

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.160
if he does this to others they will beat him,

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.920
so it’s better he takes out temper on Me.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.600
And I never, never felt that way

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.040
that he’s dominating Me.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.120
Only thing I thought, he’s taking out his temper.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.960
But I’ve seen that whenever

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:51.320
I said something to him, he thought about it.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.600
In his lifetime I’ve taken eleven decisions;

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.000
and all these decisions

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.320
he still remembers one by one

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.760
and knows that it was very, very important.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.280
Other things I never tell him what to do.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:13.440
Whatever was most important is the principle.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.200
Now, he also realized that

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.000
I have a very important mission.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.400
So he gave Me money, he gave Me time, gave Me all freedom.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.480
But first I had to establish Myself

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.680
as a very sensible, devoted wife.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.840
The men as a whole are very different type,

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.840
you must understand.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.320
They are extroverts,

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.160
and whatever the women care

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.080
too much for, they do not.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.800
It’s all right,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.040
because women and men are complementary.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.400
Like Ali was there outside working everything out,

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:01.280
while Fatima Bi in the house, home,

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.000
who never went out,

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.760
but he knew his source of energy

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.480
from where it was coming.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.320
Because women were never respected as shakti,

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:20.280
they started getting drifted into this Western modern ideas

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.800
that “we have to fight men,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.840
they are problematic, they are troubling us

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.800
and we should take revenge.”

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.200
That’s how society cannot work out.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.680
Responsibility of the women is much greater

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.200
than that of men.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.080
Men have to just go to offices,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.720
work it out something, come back home.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:53.480
Women have to lifelong generate the energy

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.800
for the growth of the children,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.760
the protection of the husband,

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.200
for all the sensible things that she has to do.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.360
That’s why in India we say,

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.680
“A woman is to be absolutely respected,

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.160
and she has to be respectable.”

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.600
Moreover it is not only in India,

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.200
I’ve seen it all over that women

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.240
are always respected if they are housewives.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.440
For example,

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.640
I go with My husband to some function.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.480
I’m respected as much as he is respected.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.520
For example,

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.920
his deputy won’t be respected as I am respected,

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.160
his secretary won’t be respected.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:38.920
No one.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:44.240
I, as his wife, is respected the same way because I’m his wife.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.240
Nobody looks down upon Me

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.600
because I’m somebody’s wife.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.840
Is all over it is like this.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.800
I’ll give you a case of a lady I knew.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.680
She used to think she’s a very smart person, you know,

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.880
always looked after her body and just

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.800
to be thin and all that,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.440
and she wanted to attract all the men

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.680
and all kinds of things,

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.560
she would wear, you see, jeans and,

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.000
you know, quite old lady.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.440
And her husband was a big man

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.960
he was a chief cabinet secretary,

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.200
very senior to us.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.920
So one day we were all invited for a dinner.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.760
So, she was not there.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.320
So many asked him, so many people,

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.280
“Where is your wife, where is your wife?”

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.320
He said, “I don’t know where she is.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.840
She was to come here.”

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.800
I was also thinking where is she, where is she gone,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.800
because there was a seat for her, a special seat.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.400
So before sitting for the dinner

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.080
I went for, I went into the bathroom.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.840
And there the poor thing was sitting on one corner.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.680
I said, “Why are you sitting here?”

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.080
So she said, “They made me sit here.

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.320
I don’t know what to do.”

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.360
So I brought her out. I said,

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.160
“Why did you make her sit there?”

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.960
And she was thinking she’s very smart

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.600
she’s done her hair nicely,

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.360
she’s looking like an actress.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.040
“Oh, is she the wife?” I said, “Yes.”

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.680
“Oh, my God! We thought she’s the secretary.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.280
How could she be? She has no dignity of her own,

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.000
the way she was dressed stupidly.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.600
How can we believe that she’s the wife?

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.840
She has no dignity as a wife of a Indian

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.040
gentleman so highly placed.”

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.000
And poor thing was sitting there for half-an-hour,

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.280
smoking.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.800
They couldn’t believe it. Then they asked Me,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.920
“Are You sure she’s his wife?”

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.680
I said, “Yes, I’m sure.”

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.960
I mean, she came to the table, nobody got up for her.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.400
And they still thought, all the rest,

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.240
she’s the secretary who has come.

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.160
Then we had to tell them, “that’s his wife.”

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.680
She was thinking she’s a smart young lady, you know;

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.360
at that old age behaving stupidly.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.000
So even in the West a woman is respected

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.640
if she’s a good housewife.

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.400
Anywhere, she is respected.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.840
I was surprised also that

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.800
I knew somebody very highly placed,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.520
a minister in the cabinet

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:29.040
of England,

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.040
and he was

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:36.120
supposed to be little wayward

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.080
and nobody would take notice of him.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.160
Nobody would. “Don’t look at him!”

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.520
I was not so good at the scandals

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.120
that they had in the all diplomatic circles,

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.840
but I said that “Why don’t you talk to this man?”

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.800
“No, not worth it.”

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.080
I said, “Why?”

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:03.600
They said, “He’s horrible. He is not a good man.”

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.080
“Yes, but why? What has he done?”

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.800
They said, “He’s a flirt,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.040
and he is looking at other women

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.120
and he’s doing all kinds of things,”

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.960
and they told stories about him. My God!

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.160
Such a big man like a minister –

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.840
why is he behaving like this?

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.800
Like a stupid donkey, he is going about …

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.640
Nobody would shake hands with him.

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.840
Even men would not look at him.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.640
Now, of course, a new society is forming of all these

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.440
stupid people. That’s different.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:44.320
But one Sahaja Yogi

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.880
who will visit these places

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:50.080
will be amazed how stupid they are.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.520
They can make it out.

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:56.040
All of them catch on their Left Nabhi,

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.800
whether they are women or men.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.840
But it’s more dangerous for men if they have a wife like that.

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:07.440
Now, the Left Nabhi if it catches, what happens?

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.040
What diseases you'll have?

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:14.880
The first and foremost is blood cancer.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.360
With the Left Nabhi you can get blood cancer.

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.280
Women think they can dominate their husband,

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.160
they can do this to their husband,

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.960
they can put them right, but they don’t know

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:30.440
they are causing a serious disease like blood cancer.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.760
I know of somebody who was suffering

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.440
from blood cancer, but we cured him

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.520
and then we discovered his Left Nabhi was still bad.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.800
Again and again he was getting relapse.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.760
Then we found out it was his wife.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.200
She was such a dangerous woman for him.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.400
And he wouldn’t leave her, wouldn’t leave her.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.880
So I told him, “I will not treat you again

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.400
if you live with that woman.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.960
Better throw her out, or you send her somewhere else.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.680
But if you are going to live with this woman,

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.680
I’m not going to treat you.”

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.640
He also called her and I told her on her face

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:15.080
that “You’re a very dominating, horrible shrew woman,

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.960
and if you try to torture your husband,

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.840
he cannot be cured.”

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.120
But she went on.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:27.800
And then, the end result was horrible, horrible, horrible.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.880
He developed a big spleen like that,

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.000
all of it was taken out, and doctors told that

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.080
“within six months you’ll be finished.”

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.280
So on both the cases, I would say,

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.400
the wife tried to dominate the husband,

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:46.040
and husband getting attached to that wife still.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.920
It’s recent case I’m telling you.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.320
Now, we are husband and wife

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.160
because we love each other, we are complementary.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.880
Woman is a woman, man is a man.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:02.600
Men should not expect women to be like you – very fast,

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.520
and women should not expect men to be like you –

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:12.320
very, I should say, noble.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.400
They are qualities of a woman and the qualities of a man.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.000
But the greatest power of a woman is her chastity.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.640
If her chastity is disturbed,

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:29.600
then she is a dangerous person,

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.680
very dangerous.

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.200
She can not only harm her husband,

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.440
but also her children, her society.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.000
We come from a culture which is very akin

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.200
to Islamic culture also.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:49.480
Indian culture is like that.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.800
In the Indian culture women respect their chastity

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.560
more than anything in this world.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:58.200
They can give up everything, but not their chastity.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.880
And once - there’s a story

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.880
I must tell you, very interesting,

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:06.080
about a very beautiful woman called Padmini.

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.040
She was the wife of a king.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.400
And there was a horrible Muslim king who wanted

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.800
to see this woman, because he heard she was very beautiful.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.080
See, this is, was a funny thing.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.960
And she came, and he came to that kingdom

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.520
and he said, “I must look at this lady, otherwise

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.200
I’ll destroy the whole kingdom.”

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:30.520
Now people said, “This he can’t do, she’s our queen.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:34.040
She can’t, he can’t see our queen like that.”

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:37.600
She just thought, “All right. He need not see me,

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.400
but he might see my reflection.”

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.760
So she stood before a mirror

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.800
and he saw her reflection.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.040
Then he became even more mad

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.560
and he said, “I must have this woman.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.720
If you don’t give her to me,

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.600
then I’ll destroy all of you.”

00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:01.000
Imagine a king doing all this nonsense for a woman –

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.040
shows what a useless fellow he was.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.320
So he brought all his army, everything,

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.720
and settled down near the fort

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.960
where these people were, and sent a message that

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.440
“if you don’t send this lady to me,

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.120
then I’m going to attack.”

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:22.720
They were not prepared, didn’t know what to do,

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:26.880
so they said that “Let us go and fight him.

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:30.280
We cannot allow our queen to be given to him.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.680
This is a question of our prestige.”

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:39.520
They took a hundred palanquin.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.640
Do you understand palanquin?

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.720
They took a hundred palanquin.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:47.880
And in those hundred palanquins there were four warriors

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:50.440
sitting with these arms and their machines,

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.720
and there were two who were carrying them.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.200
And they said, “All right. The queen is coming with her

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.600
hundred maids.”

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:02.080
The Muslims that time were, the Muslim king was

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.840
having his drinks and things, very happy

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.240
that the queen is going to come.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.640
So these people went there

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:15.000
and came out of their palanquins and started fighting.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:20.360
They had told these women that “In case we win,

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:24.280
by five o’clock in the morning we’ll lit a fire

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.400
and you will see the fire,

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.200
then you’ll know that we have won the case.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:33.160
But if we do not win, then you should know

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:37.040
for definite that we have not won the battle.”

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.040
They were only, say, four hundred people or six hundred people,

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.560
and thousands were with this man and he had

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.320
guns and cannons and everything.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.560
So they started fighting.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.520
In that fight

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:57.080
that Muslim king won -

00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:00.160
because he had so much of power -

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:05.120
and most of these people died. Even the king was killed.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:09.440
There was no fire lit at five o’clock,

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:13.280
so these women saw there’s no fire lit.

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:18.120
So they made a huge big platform, a pyre,

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.720
they climbed down to the pyre and lit the fire,

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:26.600
and they all died. Three thousand women died,

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.880
because they didn’t want other men to touch them.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.520
Any other man coming and touching them

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.720
means their chastity is finished.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:38.640
There are many, many stories of this kind in India.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.720
So, how they respected their chastity!

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:47.560
It’s easy, you see, to fall to some sort of a,

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.880
another

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.400
temptation,

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:57.080
but if this is your power,

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.800
why you should submit yourself

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.880
to something which is so useless?

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.040
In Sahaja Yoga we have to realize.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.720
Men also must know that if their

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.960
wives are so chaste and so good,

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.280
they must respect them.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:18.280
They should also realize that they have also rakhi sisters,

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.520
which is that we are very chaste people.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:25.120
We respect the chastity of a rakhi sister

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:30.720
and we do not want to in any way to comply with anyone

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.320
who does not respect the chastity.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.240
Then the men also become chaste.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.400
When the women are chaste men also become chaste.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.880
And this chastity is your main power,

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:48.120
is this chastity is the one is the power of Shri Ganesha.

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:51.200
And when you get this Shri Ganesha’s power,

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.960
you know how powerful you become

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:58.840
with the innocence that is awakened within you.

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:02.200
So without the chastity the women cannot achieve

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:06.120
anything in Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:09.800
One has to give up all the past ideas,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.400
all the past things, and also the way there is bombardment

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:18.960
from the newspapers, from the media, from everything.

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.880
Recently I read a beautiful book,

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:26.760
so big as that, has come out that Media Versus America.

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:32.400
In that they have said that how this media has put

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:37.720
ideas into the heads of women and men,

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:43.200
decrying the utility of married life

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:46.400
how they have killed the married life.

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:51.440
They marry, then divorce; they marry, then divorce.

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.960
The same thing goes on all the time.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.480
In Sahaja Yoga, of course, it’s not that bad.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:01.720
We had eighty-six weddings this time. Eighty-six.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.920
Out of which one was about to fizzle out;

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:08.080
that also is established.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.800
In Sahaja Yoga it’s much better.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.720
People understand the importance of married life.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:18.080
It’s a drama, but also it is tapas,

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:23.000
it is a tapasya with which you understand

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.000
your own powers.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:30.000
I would say a man is like the sun, but

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.200
the woman is like the Mother Earth.

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.040
The difference is like this:

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.200
that the sun shines, gives light,

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:44.240
it gives also nourishment to the Mother Earth in a way;

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.280
and the Mother Earth gives everything,

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:49.840
she bears so much of things,

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.600
she bears all our sins.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:58.080
So a housewife is like the Mother Earth.

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.720
She gives joy to everyone, to her husband,

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:03.880
to her children. She doesn’t think about herself.

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:08.200
She doesn’t think "how I could achieve great things

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.080
through my beauty maybe, through my body,

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.600
through my education,

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:17.160
through my

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.280
powers that I’ve got" – no, she doesn’t.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:25.280
What she thinks, "how I can make others powerful,

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:30.480
how I can give them power, how I can help them."

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:35.320
This is the typical

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:38.800
ideology of a woman.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.160
If it is not so, then she’s not a woman.

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:46.000
I mean, she feels – if somebody says,

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.040
“I want to come to your house for dinner,”

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.640
she feels very happy. “Oh, that’s very good.

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.640
Now then, what should I cook? What should I do?”

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.600
This is a woman’s attitude.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:00.040
Once we had a group of people, about twenty-five

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.840
of them had come to see Me.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:05.000
I was sitting with them in an open space,

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.120
and then I sent word to My daughter that they are here and

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.080
it might be late, so better prepare dinner for them.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:14.000
After the thing I said, “There dinner is for you, let's go.”

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.320
They said, “How?” I said, “All right.”

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.440
She was so overjoyed, My daughter.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.440
She had prepared all kinds of things,

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.600
her friends also came to help her.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.560
And they were surprised, all these foreigners, that

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.920
“How, Mother, she’s so happy about it?

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:32.040
If I tell my wife” – that’s the beginning of Sahaja Yoga –

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.120
“that even three persons are coming for dinner,

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:38.280
she’d go round and round and round ...”

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:42.080
I said, “Why?”

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.560
“ … and she’d grudge and grumble,

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:48.280
and she’d show all her temper with the people.”

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.040
I was quite surprised.

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:58.000
In Sahaja Yoga that’s how we live.

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:01.040
We want to give love, and

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:06.160
men have to appreciate that love and enjoy that love;

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:09.240
whether you are a brother or a husband

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:14.040
or a son, any way, the woman’s love is for you.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:18.720
And she gives you that love that makes you absolutely,

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:23.400
not only joyous but also religious.

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:27.120
Because it’s a relative thing.

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.040
If a woman starts misbehaving,

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.400
that’s the worst for the society:

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.160
men also start misbehaving.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.480
Men, as it is, are extroverts.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:37.760
So to control them,

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:41.000
put them as householders,

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.880
women must know how to keep them.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.320
It’s not easy to run a house,

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:51.760
it’s not easy to run your family,

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:56.280
it’s not easy to look after your children – very difficult.

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:01.200
And those who have those qualities are the best women

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.880
and they really achieve it.

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:09.000
I mean, you can think of your mothers,

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.800
how much they loved you,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.880
all the men and the women.

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:15.240
Why? Why do you think of your mother so much?

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.680
Because she sacrificed everything,

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:21.920
but without showing that she was sacrificing.

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:25.320
She did so much for you, so you could...

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:31.800
Woman’s potential to love is tremendous,

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.680
tremendous!

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:38.080
And this is what we have to learn from Fatima.

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:41.840
She gave Her two children to be killed.

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:46.480
She knew, because She was, after all, Vishnumaya.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.200
She was the incarnation of Vishnumaya.

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.160
She knew Her children will be killed,

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.240
but still She sent Her children,

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.240
“All right. Doesn’t matter.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:01.040
Even if I know that they are going to die, it’s all right."

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.640
Such bravery, such courage,

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:10.160
such understanding of the duty of Her children.

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:14.160
Today we remember them as Hassan and Hussein.

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:17.560
Supposing She had said, “No, no, no, no, don’t go

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.840
for the war. Stay at home.”

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:24.840
And if She had forced them not to go,

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.160
then they would not have gone.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.880
We would not have talked about them today, isn’t it?

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:32.920
In any case, they would have been dead sometime,

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:37.520
but the death of a hero they got because of their mother.

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:40.640
Of course, they were also a kind of incarnations,

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:45.040
but the way She gave them absolutely complete

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:49.880
encouragement, “Go and fight for the right thing.”

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.840
Because these fundamentalists

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:57.320
were trying to bring their fanaticism.

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:03.600
So today is a day I have to tell men also

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:09.080
that you must learn to respect a woman who is chaste.

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:13.560
Please understand, if your wife is a chaste woman,

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:18.840
then you have no right, in no way to trouble her.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:22.040
Not that she should be respectable

00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:24.760
but you should see that everyone respects her,

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:28.200
nobody insults her, should stand by her,

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.800
be identified with her.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.600
But if she’s not a chaste woman

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:37.360
and if she is that kind, better keep out.

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.800
I do not have that much courage to say that

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.480
“All right. Go ahead with her and I’ll look after.”

00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:45.320
It’s very difficult.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.960
I don’t know what complications might come.

00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:53.720
With all these experiences

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.040
one learns one thing for definite,

00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:01.560
that woman is much more inward,

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:04.880
she has much more powers,

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:08.760
she is much more wiser than other people are,

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:12.080
if she keeps to her chastity.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:17.520
That’s the point on which all her

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:22.400
movement rotates, all her personality rotates.

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.600
She may be anything.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.640
We had women – like there was a lady who was

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:31.080
only seventeen years of age, and she became a widow.

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:34.000
Widow she became at the age of seventeen,

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:37.560
and she fought a very horrible king called as

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.640
Aurangzeb, and she saw to it that he was battled;

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.400
her name was Tarabai.

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.520
We have women in India of different, different,

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.800
say, characters in a way,

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.840
fighting in different, different ways,

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:57.400
but they were first and foremost were housewives.

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:02.240
All their powers were there as housewives.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:05.680
So do not look down upon

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.560
the housewife.

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:10.760
When I’m traveling in the plane,

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.800
they ask Me, “Mother, what is your profession?”

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.240
“Housewife.”

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.760
My profession is housewife.

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:21.600
I’m a housewife of a very, very big family.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:27.800
I’m looking after My children,

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000
I’m loving them, they love Me,

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:37.680
and this profession is the best, I think,

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:41.520
because it is so joy-giving,

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:45.480
it’s so beautiful.

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.320
It’s love.

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:51.000
It’s so energy-giving.

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:56.240
And at this age also I never feel My age,

00:36:56.440 --> 00:37:00.440
because I am the Mother of so many of you.

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:04.800
And it never comes to My head that I’m old now

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.720
and I must do so-and-so, I must take rest

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:11.360
and I must not do this work or that...

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:17.280
Because this feeling of love

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:20.560
for My children: I have to nourish them,

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.640
I have to look after them,

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:25.680
because all My powers I have to give them.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:29.520
I never try to show off My powers to you in any way.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.200
It’s only you, who should imbibe all My powers.

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.600
That’s the only desire I have,

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:39.000
that you should be as powerful as Myself.

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.520
Of course you discover it that I have powers,

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.320
but as far as I am concerned

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:49.080
I want that you should forget as to

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:52.320
what powers I have, but you should yourself

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.840
have all these powers within yourself,

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:57.400
so that you can save the world.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.760
That’s the only thing I want to give you.

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:05.040
And I want to assure you that you all can have

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.880
everything that I have; only thing if you can retain –

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:12.200
simple thing in life – that we have to be righteous people.

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:17.320
We cannot play about, we cannot misbehave.

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.000
Nowadays so many things are coming up,

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.680
things that men are doing and women are doing;

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.640
we are not.

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:27.240
In the evolutionary process,

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:30.560
as we may say that there were some monkeys - chimpanzees

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:33.840
that became human beings. But no,

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.040
in between there were some other human beings

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:39.240
that came in, which vanished.

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:43.080
So, very few people will become Sahaja Yogis,

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.200
who will be saved.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.680
All the rest will be not there -

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:50.000
they’ll be neither monkeys nor human beings, finished.

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:54.600
These are all self-destroying things

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:56.760
which kills the family,

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.760
which kills the chastity within us,

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.880
and then we are left high and dry.

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.920
We are nowhere. We have diseases, we have troubles,

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:10.640
we have problems. So be careful,

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.280
very, very careful.

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:18.080
And this special puja for

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:20.120
Fatima Bi is

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.920
puja of Vishnumaya.

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:25.600
Also the guilt that works on the Left Vishuddhi

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.280
can be cured if you develop your chastity.

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:31.720
You’ll never feel guilty,

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:34.080
because that’s such a virtue you have.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.800
In that virtue you will never, never feel guilty,

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.880
and you can stand up to any nonsense

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:45.320
because you are standing on the truth of chastity.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.760
Today it’s special day, I would say, when we are

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:55.440
worshipping this great ideal of chastity that is Fatima Bi.

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:58.640
May God bless you.
