00:02.520 --> 00:06.400
Today is a very

00:07.200 --> 00:11.240
joyous that all of us are here in Turkey,

00:11.960 --> 00:18.400
to celebrate the Puja of Fatima.

00:27.160 --> 00:33.360
As you know about Her that She was the daughter

00:33.600 --> 00:38.680
of Mohammed Sahib and was married to Ali,

00:38.880 --> 00:42.640
and She had two children, Hassan and Hussein,

00:43.240 --> 00:47.400
who were ultimately killed in Karbala

00:47.640 --> 00:50.080
by the fanatics,

00:50.280 --> 00:54.280
who were that time called themselves Sunnis.

00:59.960 --> 01:07.440
All this happened because there were fanaticism,

01:09.400 --> 01:12.000
and the fanaticism

01:12.200 --> 01:15.200
that makes person thinks always

01:15.680 --> 01:18.720
that they are on the right

01:18.920 --> 01:23.720
and they have every right to be

01:26.600 --> 01:31.360
angry, to persuade, to convince another party,

01:31.600 --> 01:33.240
another person.

01:34.800 --> 01:38.000
And these fanaticisms grew

01:38.200 --> 01:41.240
since long – it’s not a new thing.

01:44.640 --> 01:49.440
It is so obvious now that our main problem

01:49.640 --> 01:53.480
in this world is of fanaticism.

01:54.760 --> 01:57.680
Fatima lost Her two children,

01:57.880 --> 02:01.760
and She was the embodiment of

02:01.960 --> 02:04.160
Gruha Lakshmi.

02:04.680 --> 02:08.280
She resides in our Left Nabhi.

02:08.760 --> 02:13.360
So for all the diseases that are connected with the spleen,

02:16.640 --> 02:21.800
all the problems that are connected with your Left Nabhi

02:22.000 --> 02:27.440
can be only corrected by Fatima.

02:27.680 --> 02:31.600
So you have to keep Fatima awakened within yourself.

02:32.680 --> 02:35.400
That we are here in the Islamic culture,

02:35.640 --> 02:39.280
we can say, this is place of Islamic culture;

02:44.440 --> 02:47.720
and in the Islamic culture a housewife was given

02:47.920 --> 02:51.120
a very, very important place.

02:53.880 --> 02:57.000
At the time of Mohammed Sahib

02:57.200 --> 03:01.120
there were struggles and fights

03:01.320 --> 03:04.760
and wars going on between different tribes.

03:05.400 --> 03:09.720
As a result many, many

03:11.160 --> 03:13.720
young men were killed.

03:15.960 --> 03:20.480
Only quite old people survived,

03:21.000 --> 03:25.040
and also so many women.

03:25.240 --> 03:29.920
This is the reason why Mohammed said that

03:30.120 --> 03:33.160
“You can marry four wives, five wives;

03:34.080 --> 03:39.160
but you cannot allow them to remain

03:41.160 --> 03:47.840
unmarried or they will have extramarital relationships.

03:48.880 --> 03:53.400
That will be the greatest fall for Islam,

03:53.840 --> 03:55.760
for that religion.”

03:57.240 --> 04:00.800
So He understood that unless and until

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
women are kept absolutely chaste,

04:06.480 --> 04:09.000
absolutely pure,

04:11.680 --> 04:13.960
there cannot be the Kingdom of God.

04:14.160 --> 04:15.720
In Sanskrit there’s a saying,

04:15.920 --> 04:19.440
“Yatra narya pujyante, tatra ramante devata”:

04:19.680 --> 04:23.360
meaning “Where the women are respected,

04:24.080 --> 04:26.840
are worshipped and they are worshipful” –

04:27.040 --> 04:29.080
not that they are to be worshipped,

04:29.280 --> 04:32.120
but they are respectable –

04:32.320 --> 04:37.520
“there only exists the Kingdom of God.”

04:38.520 --> 04:43.200
So, so much responsibility is on women.

04:44.960 --> 04:47.400
So from Fatima’s life we have to know that

04:47.960 --> 04:51.440
She did not go out of Her house

04:51.680 --> 04:55.120
and She remained a housewife,

04:55.720 --> 04:58.760
and She made Her two children grow up

04:59.280 --> 05:03.080
in such a manner that they had to fight the war

05:03.280 --> 05:05.720
against fanaticism.

05:06.880 --> 05:09.800
Her husband also was there.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.960
This is how a woman of a housewife

05:14.600 --> 05:17.760
is shown to be so powerful that though

05:17.960 --> 05:20.400
she’s in the house, though she’s –

05:20.640 --> 05:22.440
looks to be just a mother,

05:22.680 --> 05:25.240
but how powerful she is.

05:29.800 --> 05:35.480
But these days a new type of ideas have come up.

05:35.720 --> 05:38.160
Men also have been very nasty

05:38.360 --> 05:41.120
and very aggressive with women.

05:41.320 --> 05:45.480
As a result we find there’s a big

05:46.520 --> 05:50.720
opposition to men,

05:51.280 --> 05:54.480
and a kind of a big rift has been created

05:54.720 --> 05:57.680
between men and women.

05:59.840 --> 06:03.760
Also the men, the way they started becoming licentious,

06:03.960 --> 06:06.400
perverted,

06:06.640 --> 06:09.360
going to bad women,

06:10.080 --> 06:11.280
the good women also thought,

06:11.480 --> 06:14.160
“Why not we also become like that?”

06:14.600 --> 06:18.120
and they also started doing wrong things

06:18.320 --> 06:20.720
which they should not have done.

06:20.920 --> 06:25.240
That’s how the whole society crumbled down.

06:26.600 --> 06:31.120
Now, the men are responsible for the politics and the economics

06:31.320 --> 06:36.640
and also the nation, as administrators,

06:37.280 --> 06:40.680
but women are responsible for the society.

06:42.520 --> 06:45.880
Whether she’s in the house or she’s outside,

06:46.080 --> 06:49.520
whether she’s working in the house or outside,

06:49.720 --> 06:53.080
she is responsible for

06:53.720 --> 06:57.280
the maintenance of the society.

06:58.840 --> 07:01.640
And there it looks as, sometimes to a woman,

07:01.840 --> 07:04.160
that she’s dominated,

07:04.360 --> 07:06.160
that her husband dominates her,

07:06.360 --> 07:09.080
that the husband’s family dominates her,

07:09.280 --> 07:11.840
but it’s the quality of a woman

07:12.040 --> 07:15.800
that brings up the level of the society.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.240
Not only the level,

07:17.440 --> 07:21.600
but also in the family she is then respected.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.480
It’s a very important role as a housewife;

07:27.720 --> 07:30.360
perhaps we never realize it.

07:30.720 --> 07:32.960
Now we see so many lights here,

07:33.160 --> 07:35.760
electricity is there running.

07:35.960 --> 07:38.680
But what is the source of this electricity?

07:39.360 --> 07:43.280
Is it not much more important than these lights?

07:44.000 --> 07:48.960
So men are nothing but, we can say, the kinetic energy,

07:49.360 --> 07:52.920
but what is the potential is the woman of the house.

07:53.960 --> 07:58.640
But these days it’s becoming a very funny situation.

07:59.480 --> 08:02.680
I was surprised when I went to

08:02.880 --> 08:05.280
Italy also, that

08:06.000 --> 08:09.400
how women have made themself cheap.

08:10.280 --> 08:14.520
And they want to look attractive to every man.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.960
What is the need?

08:18.000 --> 08:20.800
It’s a joyless pursuit into which men are going,

08:21.000 --> 08:25.160
and women are making themselves absolutely cheap.

08:26.440 --> 08:29.840
This cheapness of women

08:30.040 --> 08:33.760
is not going to give them any strength or joy.

08:33.960 --> 08:36.720
I know one feels very unhappy

08:36.920 --> 08:39.400
the way men treat them.

08:39.640 --> 08:42.280
But you must have your own personality,

08:42.480 --> 08:45.920
you must have your own understanding

08:46.120 --> 08:49.000
that you are a woman, you are shakti,

08:50.160 --> 08:53.400
and nobody can suppress the shakti.

08:53.640 --> 08:57.760
But if you do not keep to your own

08:57.960 --> 09:00.120
personality or your chastity,

09:01.120 --> 09:03.680
then you cannot achieve

09:05.080 --> 09:07.200
your goal in life.

09:07.400 --> 09:12.600
And your goal in life is to give power to your son,

09:12.800 --> 09:14.960
to your husband,

09:15.520 --> 09:19.240
to all the society the woman gives power.

09:19.440 --> 09:21.480
I am also a woman, as you know,

09:21.720 --> 09:24.400
and I also have a family.

09:25.640 --> 09:28.160
With all the powers that I have,

09:28.360 --> 09:32.800
I never showed them that I have those powers.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.320
I always listened to My husband, obeyed him

09:35.520 --> 09:38.720
though sometimes he was very unreasonable also.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.040
And he also came from a society

09:42.240 --> 09:45.680
which was more Islamic-oriented.

09:46.880 --> 09:50.240
But that was just a joke for Me,

09:51.480 --> 09:53.240
because I thought

09:53.440 --> 09:56.200
“He’s just like a child

09:56.400 --> 09:58.920
and I have to be

10:00.920 --> 10:03.320
very patient with him.”

10:04.200 --> 10:06.600
He always says that because of My powers

10:06.800 --> 10:08.480
he earned everything in life.

10:08.720 --> 10:11.360
Always, in the presence of everyone he says so.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.920
I don’t know that part, but definitely

10:14.120 --> 10:18.640
I feel very satisfied with My own married life.

10:19.240 --> 10:22.400
I never think the way other people think

10:22.600 --> 10:24.720
that we must try to dominate the husband,

10:24.920 --> 10:28.400
we must fight him, we must have a right to do this.

10:28.640 --> 10:32.640
Our right is within ourselves, within our powers.

10:33.920 --> 10:38.320
Also the men must realize that they have to respect women.

10:38.920 --> 10:40.800
I mean, not to such an extent that she tells you

10:41.000 --> 10:42.120
to do something wrong,

10:42.320 --> 10:44.800
and you just get lost with this – that’s not the way.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.080
That’s slavishness.

10:46.280 --> 10:48.520
Men have to be men.

10:49.800 --> 10:53.160
It in no way means the women are dominated by men.

10:53.360 --> 10:56.240
I do not say it that way;

10:56.440 --> 10:58.960
because if you have your own powers,

10:59.160 --> 11:00.920
ultimately whatever may be the husband,

11:01.120 --> 11:04.840
he’ll have to come and

11:05.480 --> 11:09.200
understand what you want.

11:09.800 --> 11:12.360
He’ll have to know what you are.

11:12.600 --> 11:15.440
I have seen it many-a-times in My own lifetime

11:15.680 --> 11:18.640
that it has done that way.

11:18.840 --> 11:21.160
I would never say anything.

11:22.040 --> 11:24.080
Supposing he gets angry, I would keep quiet.

11:24.280 --> 11:25.920
All right.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.960
After all he has to fight outside

11:28.160 --> 11:30.120
and he has to take out temper on Me

11:30.320 --> 11:31.440
that he couldn’t do:

11:31.640 --> 11:33.160
if he does this to others they will beat him,

11:33.360 --> 11:35.920
so it’s better he takes out temper on Me.

11:36.120 --> 11:38.600
And I never, never felt that way

11:38.800 --> 11:40.040
that he’s dominating Me.

11:40.240 --> 11:43.120
Only thing I thought, he’s taking out his temper.

11:43.320 --> 11:45.960
But I’ve seen that whenever

11:46.160 --> 11:51.320
I said something to him, he thought about it.

11:51.520 --> 11:55.600
In his lifetime I’ve taken eleven decisions;

11:56.320 --> 11:59.000
and all these decisions

11:59.200 --> 12:02.320
he still remembers one by one

12:02.520 --> 12:05.760
and knows that it was very, very important.

12:05.960 --> 12:09.280
Other things I never tell him what to do.

12:09.480 --> 12:13.440
Whatever was most important is the principle.

12:14.400 --> 12:18.200
Now, he also realized that

12:18.400 --> 12:21.000
I have a very important mission.

12:21.200 --> 12:24.400
So he gave Me money, he gave Me time, gave Me all freedom.

12:24.600 --> 12:27.480
But first I had to establish Myself

12:27.720 --> 12:31.680
as a very sensible, devoted wife.

12:34.320 --> 12:37.840
The men as a whole are very different type,

12:38.040 --> 12:39.840
you must understand.

12:40.080 --> 12:42.320
They are extroverts,

12:42.520 --> 12:44.160
and whatever the women care

12:44.360 --> 12:46.080
too much for, they do not.

12:46.280 --> 12:47.800
It’s all right,

12:48.000 --> 12:52.040
because women and men are complementary.

12:52.800 --> 12:56.400
Like Ali was there outside working everything out,

12:56.640 --> 13:01.280
while Fatima Bi in the house, home,

13:01.480 --> 13:03.000
who never went out,

13:03.200 --> 13:05.760
but he knew his source of energy

13:05.960 --> 13:08.480
from where it was coming.

13:11.120 --> 13:14.320
Because women were never respected as shakti,

13:14.600 --> 13:20.280
they started getting drifted into this Western modern ideas

13:20.480 --> 13:22.800
that “we have to fight men,

13:23.000 --> 13:25.840
they are problematic, they are troubling us

13:26.040 --> 13:29.800
and we should take revenge.”

13:30.000 --> 13:33.200
That’s how society cannot work out.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.680
Responsibility of the women is much greater

13:37.880 --> 13:40.200
than that of men.

13:40.400 --> 13:43.080
Men have to just go to offices,

13:45.000 --> 13:47.720
work it out something, come back home.

13:48.280 --> 13:53.480
Women have to lifelong generate the energy

13:53.720 --> 13:55.800
for the growth of the children,

13:56.000 --> 13:57.760
the protection of the husband,

13:57.960 --> 14:01.200
for all the sensible things that she has to do.

14:01.640 --> 14:03.360
That’s why in India we say,

14:03.600 --> 14:07.680
“A woman is to be absolutely respected,

14:08.520 --> 14:11.160
and she has to be respectable.”

14:11.360 --> 14:13.600
Moreover it is not only in India,

14:13.800 --> 14:17.200
I’ve seen it all over that women

14:17.400 --> 14:20.240
are always respected if they are housewives.

14:20.440 --> 14:22.440
For example,

14:22.880 --> 14:26.640
I go with My husband to some function.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.480
I’m respected as much as he is respected.

14:30.720 --> 14:31.520
For example,

14:31.720 --> 14:34.920
his deputy won’t be respected as I am respected,

14:35.200 --> 14:37.160
his secretary won’t be respected.

14:37.960 --> 14:38.920
No one.

14:39.120 --> 14:44.240
I, as his wife, is respected the same way because I’m his wife.

14:46.160 --> 14:49.240
Nobody looks down upon Me

14:49.440 --> 14:51.600
because I’m somebody’s wife.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.840
Is all over it is like this.

14:54.040 --> 14:56.800
I’ll give you a case of a lady I knew.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.680
She used to think she’s a very smart person, you know,

14:59.880 --> 15:01.880
always looked after her body and just

15:02.080 --> 15:03.800
to be thin and all that,

15:04.000 --> 15:05.440
and she wanted to attract all the men

15:05.640 --> 15:07.680
and all kinds of things,

15:07.920 --> 15:09.560
she would wear, you see, jeans and,

15:09.760 --> 15:12.000
you know, quite old lady.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.440
And her husband was a big man

15:14.680 --> 15:16.960
he was a chief cabinet secretary,

15:17.160 --> 15:19.200
very senior to us.

15:19.400 --> 15:22.920
So one day we were all invited for a dinner.

15:25.120 --> 15:27.760
So, she was not there.

15:27.960 --> 15:29.320
So many asked him, so many people,

15:29.520 --> 15:32.280
“Where is your wife, where is your wife?”

15:32.480 --> 15:34.320
He said, “I don’t know where she is.

15:34.520 --> 15:36.840
She was to come here.”

15:37.040 --> 15:39.800
I was also thinking where is she, where is she gone,

15:40.000 --> 15:43.800
because there was a seat for her, a special seat.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.400
So before sitting for the dinner

15:46.640 --> 15:50.080
I went for, I went into the bathroom.

15:50.280 --> 15:52.840
And there the poor thing was sitting on one corner.

15:53.040 --> 15:55.680
I said, “Why are you sitting here?”

15:56.680 --> 15:59.080
So she said, “They made me sit here.

15:59.280 --> 16:01.320
I don’t know what to do.”

16:01.520 --> 16:04.360
So I brought her out. I said,

16:04.600 --> 16:06.160
“Why did you make her sit there?”

16:06.360 --> 16:07.960
And she was thinking she’s very smart

16:08.160 --> 16:09.600
she’s done her hair nicely,

16:09.800 --> 16:12.360
she’s looking like an actress.

16:12.600 --> 16:15.040
“Oh, is she the wife?” I said, “Yes.”

16:15.240 --> 16:18.680
“Oh, my God! We thought she’s the secretary.

16:18.880 --> 16:21.280
How could she be? She has no dignity of her own,

16:21.480 --> 16:24.000
the way she was dressed stupidly.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.600
How can we believe that she’s the wife?

16:26.800 --> 16:29.840
She has no dignity as a wife of a Indian

16:30.040 --> 16:32.040
gentleman so highly placed.”

16:32.240 --> 16:35.000
And poor thing was sitting there for half-an-hour,

16:35.200 --> 16:37.280
smoking.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.800
They couldn’t believe it. Then they asked Me,

16:43.000 --> 16:44.920
“Are You sure she’s his wife?”

16:45.120 --> 16:47.680
I said, “Yes, I’m sure.”

16:48.160 --> 16:51.960
I mean, she came to the table, nobody got up for her.

16:52.160 --> 16:54.400
And they still thought, all the rest,

16:54.640 --> 16:57.240
she’s the secretary who has come.

16:57.880 --> 17:00.160
Then we had to tell them, “that’s his wife.”

17:00.360 --> 17:03.680
She was thinking she’s a smart young lady, you know;

17:03.880 --> 17:07.360
at that old age behaving stupidly.

17:07.880 --> 17:11.000
So even in the West a woman is respected

17:11.200 --> 17:13.640
if she’s a good housewife.

17:13.840 --> 17:17.400
Anywhere, she is respected.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.840
I was surprised also that

17:20.040 --> 17:22.800
I knew somebody very highly placed,

17:23.000 --> 17:26.520
a minister in the cabinet

17:26.760 --> 17:29.040
of England,

17:29.240 --> 17:32.040
and he was

17:32.280 --> 17:36.120
supposed to be little wayward

17:39.160 --> 17:42.080
and nobody would take notice of him.

17:43.080 --> 17:46.160
Nobody would. “Don’t look at him!”

17:46.360 --> 17:48.520
I was not so good at the scandals

17:48.760 --> 17:52.120
that they had in the all diplomatic circles,

17:53.200 --> 17:54.840
but I said that “Why don’t you talk to this man?”

17:55.040 --> 17:56.800
“No, not worth it.”

17:57.000 --> 17:58.080
I said, “Why?”

17:58.280 --> 18:03.600
They said, “He’s horrible. He is not a good man.”

18:04.080 --> 18:06.080
“Yes, but why? What has he done?”

18:06.280 --> 18:07.800
They said, “He’s a flirt,

18:08.000 --> 18:12.040
and he is looking at other women

18:12.240 --> 18:15.120
and he’s doing all kinds of things,”

18:15.320 --> 18:17.960
and they told stories about him. My God!

18:18.160 --> 18:21.160
Such a big man like a minister –

18:21.480 --> 18:23.840
why is he behaving like this?

18:24.040 --> 18:27.800
Like a stupid donkey, he is going about …

18:28.000 --> 18:29.640
Nobody would shake hands with him.

18:29.840 --> 18:32.840
Even men would not look at him.

18:35.120 --> 18:38.640
Now, of course, a new society is forming of all these

18:38.840 --> 18:41.440
stupid people. That’s different.

18:41.680 --> 18:44.320
But one Sahaja Yogi

18:44.520 --> 18:46.880
who will visit these places

18:47.080 --> 18:50.080
will be amazed how stupid they are.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.520
They can make it out.

18:52.760 --> 18:56.040
All of them catch on their Left Nabhi,

18:56.240 --> 18:58.800
whether they are women or men.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.840
But it’s more dangerous for men if they have a wife like that.

19:04.040 --> 19:07.440
Now, the Left Nabhi if it catches, what happens?

19:07.680 --> 19:10.040
What diseases you'll have?

19:10.240 --> 19:14.880
The first and foremost is blood cancer.

19:15.360 --> 19:18.360
With the Left Nabhi you can get blood cancer.

19:18.680 --> 19:21.280
Women think they can dominate their husband,

19:21.480 --> 19:23.160
they can do this to their husband,

19:23.360 --> 19:24.960
they can put them right, but they don’t know

19:25.160 --> 19:30.440
they are causing a serious disease like blood cancer.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.760
I know of somebody who was suffering

19:35.960 --> 19:38.440
from blood cancer, but we cured him

19:38.640 --> 19:41.520
and then we discovered his Left Nabhi was still bad.

19:41.760 --> 19:43.800
Again and again he was getting relapse.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.760
Then we found out it was his wife.

19:49.960 --> 19:53.200
She was such a dangerous woman for him.

19:53.400 --> 19:56.400
And he wouldn’t leave her, wouldn’t leave her.

19:56.640 --> 19:58.880
So I told him, “I will not treat you again

19:59.080 --> 20:00.400
if you live with that woman.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.960
Better throw her out, or you send her somewhere else.

20:04.160 --> 20:06.680
But if you are going to live with this woman,

20:06.880 --> 20:08.680
I’m not going to treat you.”

20:08.880 --> 20:11.640
He also called her and I told her on her face

20:11.840 --> 20:15.080
that “You’re a very dominating, horrible shrew woman,

20:15.280 --> 20:17.960
and if you try to torture your husband,

20:18.160 --> 20:20.840
he cannot be cured.”

20:21.640 --> 20:23.120
But she went on.

20:23.320 --> 20:27.800
And then, the end result was horrible, horrible, horrible.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.880
He developed a big spleen like that,

20:31.080 --> 20:34.000
all of it was taken out, and doctors told that

20:34.200 --> 20:37.080
“within six months you’ll be finished.”

20:37.840 --> 20:40.280
So on both the cases, I would say,

20:40.480 --> 20:42.400
the wife tried to dominate the husband,

20:42.600 --> 20:46.040
and husband getting attached to that wife still.

20:46.240 --> 20:48.920
It’s recent case I’m telling you.

20:49.120 --> 20:51.320
Now, we are husband and wife

20:51.520 --> 20:55.160
because we love each other, we are complementary.

20:55.360 --> 20:57.880
Woman is a woman, man is a man.

20:58.080 --> 21:02.600
Men should not expect women to be like you – very fast,

21:02.800 --> 21:06.520
and women should not expect men to be like you –

21:07.600 --> 21:12.320
very, I should say, noble.

21:13.000 --> 21:17.400
They are qualities of a woman and the qualities of a man.

21:17.760 --> 21:22.000
But the greatest power of a woman is her chastity.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.640
If her chastity is disturbed,

21:26.120 --> 21:29.600
then she is a dangerous person,

21:29.800 --> 21:31.680
very dangerous.

21:32.320 --> 21:35.200
She can not only harm her husband,

21:35.400 --> 21:38.440
but also her children, her society.

21:39.960 --> 21:43.000
We come from a culture which is very akin

21:43.200 --> 21:46.200
to Islamic culture also.

21:46.880 --> 21:49.480
Indian culture is like that.

21:49.920 --> 21:52.800
In the Indian culture women respect their chastity

21:53.000 --> 21:54.560
more than anything in this world.

21:54.760 --> 21:58.200
They can give up everything, but not their chastity.

21:59.400 --> 22:00.880
And once - there’s a story

22:01.080 --> 22:02.880
I must tell you, very interesting,

22:03.080 --> 22:06.080
about a very beautiful woman called Padmini.

22:06.280 --> 22:08.040
She was the wife of a king.

22:08.240 --> 22:11.400
And there was a horrible Muslim king who wanted

22:11.600 --> 22:14.800
to see this woman, because he heard she was very beautiful.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.080
See, this is, was a funny thing.

22:18.520 --> 22:21.960
And she came, and he came to that kingdom

22:22.160 --> 22:24.520
and he said, “I must look at this lady, otherwise

22:24.720 --> 22:27.200
I’ll destroy the whole kingdom.”

22:27.400 --> 22:30.520
Now people said, “This he can’t do, she’s our queen.

22:30.720 --> 22:34.040
She can’t, he can’t see our queen like that.”

22:35.160 --> 22:37.600
She just thought, “All right. He need not see me,

22:37.800 --> 22:40.400
but he might see my reflection.”

22:40.640 --> 22:43.760
So she stood before a mirror

22:43.960 --> 22:46.800
and he saw her reflection.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.040
Then he became even more mad

22:49.240 --> 22:51.560
and he said, “I must have this woman.

22:51.760 --> 22:53.720
If you don’t give her to me,

22:53.920 --> 22:56.600
then I’ll destroy all of you.”

22:56.800 --> 23:01.000
Imagine a king doing all this nonsense for a woman –

23:01.200 --> 23:04.040
shows what a useless fellow he was.

23:04.240 --> 23:07.320
So he brought all his army, everything,

23:07.520 --> 23:09.720
and settled down near the fort

23:09.920 --> 23:12.960
where these people were, and sent a message that

23:13.160 --> 23:15.440
“if you don’t send this lady to me,

23:15.640 --> 23:18.120
then I’m going to attack.”

23:18.320 --> 23:22.720
They were not prepared, didn’t know what to do,

23:22.920 --> 23:26.880
so they said that “Let us go and fight him.

23:27.080 --> 23:30.280
We cannot allow our queen to be given to him.

23:30.480 --> 23:33.680
This is a question of our prestige.”

23:34.920 --> 23:39.520
They took a hundred palanquin.

23:39.720 --> 23:42.640
Do you understand palanquin?

23:42.840 --> 23:44.720
They took a hundred palanquin.

23:44.920 --> 23:47.880
And in those hundred palanquins there were four warriors

23:48.080 --> 23:50.440
sitting with these arms and their machines,

23:50.640 --> 23:52.720
and there were two who were carrying them.

23:52.920 --> 23:55.200
And they said, “All right. The queen is coming with her

23:55.400 --> 23:57.600
hundred maids.”

23:57.880 --> 24:02.080
The Muslims that time were, the Muslim king was

24:02.280 --> 24:04.840
having his drinks and things, very happy

24:05.040 --> 24:07.240
that the queen is going to come.

24:07.440 --> 24:10.640
So these people went there

24:10.840 --> 24:15.000
and came out of their palanquins and started fighting.

24:15.200 --> 24:20.360
They had told these women that “In case we win,

24:20.600 --> 24:24.280
by five o’clock in the morning we’ll lit a fire

24:24.480 --> 24:25.400
and you will see the fire,

24:25.600 --> 24:28.200
then you’ll know that we have won the case.

24:28.400 --> 24:33.160
But if we do not win, then you should know

24:33.360 --> 24:37.040
for definite that we have not won the battle.”

24:37.880 --> 24:41.040
They were only, say, four hundred people or six hundred people,

24:41.240 --> 24:43.560
and thousands were with this man and he had

24:43.760 --> 24:46.320
guns and cannons and everything.

24:47.640 --> 24:49.560
So they started fighting.

24:49.760 --> 24:51.520
In that fight

24:52.840 --> 24:57.080
that Muslim king won -

24:57.280 --> 25:00.160
because he had so much of power -

25:01.360 --> 25:05.120
and most of these people died. Even the king was killed.

25:06.040 --> 25:09.440
There was no fire lit at five o’clock,

25:09.840 --> 25:13.280
so these women saw there’s no fire lit.

25:13.880 --> 25:18.120
So they made a huge big platform, a pyre,

25:18.680 --> 25:21.720
they climbed down to the pyre and lit the fire,

25:21.920 --> 25:26.600
and they all died. Three thousand women died,

25:26.800 --> 25:29.880
because they didn’t want other men to touch them.

25:30.080 --> 25:32.520
Any other man coming and touching them

25:32.720 --> 25:34.720
means their chastity is finished.

25:34.920 --> 25:38.640
There are many, many stories of this kind in India.

25:39.200 --> 25:42.720
So, how they respected their chastity!

25:43.520 --> 25:47.560
It’s easy, you see, to fall to some sort of a,

25:47.760 --> 25:49.880
another

25:50.080 --> 25:52.400
temptation,

25:53.680 --> 25:57.080
but if this is your power,

25:57.640 --> 25:59.800
why you should submit yourself

26:00.000 --> 26:02.880
to something which is so useless?

26:03.160 --> 26:06.040
In Sahaja Yoga we have to realize.

26:06.240 --> 26:08.720
Men also must know that if their

26:08.920 --> 26:11.960
wives are so chaste and so good,

26:12.160 --> 26:14.280
they must respect them.

26:14.480 --> 26:18.280
They should also realize that they have also rakhi sisters,

26:18.480 --> 26:21.520
which is that we are very chaste people.

26:21.720 --> 26:25.120
We respect the chastity of a rakhi sister

26:25.520 --> 26:30.720
and we do not want to in any way to comply with anyone

26:30.920 --> 26:33.320
who does not respect the chastity.

26:33.520 --> 26:36.240
Then the men also become chaste.

26:36.440 --> 26:39.400
When the women are chaste men also become chaste.

26:39.600 --> 26:42.880
And this chastity is your main power,

26:43.080 --> 26:48.120
is this chastity is the one is the power of Shri Ganesha.

26:48.320 --> 26:51.200
And when you get this Shri Ganesha’s power,

26:51.400 --> 26:54.960
you know how powerful you become

26:55.160 --> 26:58.840
with the innocence that is awakened within you.

26:59.040 --> 27:02.200
So without the chastity the women cannot achieve

27:02.400 --> 27:06.120
anything in Sahaja Yoga.

27:06.320 --> 27:09.800
One has to give up all the past ideas,

27:10.000 --> 27:14.400
all the past things, and also the way there is bombardment

27:14.600 --> 27:18.960
from the newspapers, from the media, from everything.

27:19.160 --> 27:20.880
Recently I read a beautiful book,

27:21.080 --> 27:26.760
so big as that, has come out that Media Versus America.

27:27.480 --> 27:32.400
In that they have said that how this media has put

27:32.600 --> 27:37.720
ideas into the heads of women and men,

27:37.920 --> 27:43.200
decrying the utility of married life

27:43.520 --> 27:46.400
how they have killed the married life.

27:47.640 --> 27:51.440
They marry, then divorce; they marry, then divorce.

27:51.640 --> 27:54.960
The same thing goes on all the time.

27:55.160 --> 27:57.480
In Sahaja Yoga, of course, it’s not that bad.

27:57.680 --> 28:01.720
We had eighty-six weddings this time. Eighty-six.

28:01.920 --> 28:04.920
Out of which one was about to fizzle out;

28:05.120 --> 28:08.080
that also is established.

28:08.280 --> 28:10.800
In Sahaja Yoga it’s much better.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.720
People understand the importance of married life.

28:13.920 --> 28:18.080
It’s a drama, but also it is tapas,

28:18.280 --> 28:23.000
it is a tapasya with which you understand

28:23.440 --> 28:26.000
your own powers.

28:26.200 --> 28:30.000
I would say a man is like the sun, but

28:30.200 --> 28:33.200
the woman is like the Mother Earth.

28:33.400 --> 28:36.040
The difference is like this:

28:36.240 --> 28:39.200
that the sun shines, gives light,

28:39.400 --> 28:44.240
it gives also nourishment to the Mother Earth in a way;

28:45.000 --> 28:47.280
and the Mother Earth gives everything,

28:47.680 --> 28:49.840
she bears so much of things,

28:51.040 --> 28:53.600
she bears all our sins.

28:53.800 --> 28:58.080
So a housewife is like the Mother Earth.

28:58.280 --> 29:00.720
She gives joy to everyone, to her husband,

29:00.920 --> 29:03.880
to her children. She doesn’t think about herself.

29:04.080 --> 29:08.200
She doesn’t think "how I could achieve great things

29:08.400 --> 29:11.080
through my beauty maybe, through my body,

29:11.280 --> 29:13.600
through my education,

29:13.800 --> 29:17.160
through my

29:17.440 --> 29:20.280
powers that I’ve got" – no, she doesn’t.

29:20.480 --> 29:25.280
What she thinks, "how I can make others powerful,

29:26.360 --> 29:30.480
how I can give them power, how I can help them."

29:30.680 --> 29:35.320
This is the typical

29:35.520 --> 29:38.800
ideology of a woman.

29:39.000 --> 29:43.160
If it is not so, then she’s not a woman.

29:43.720 --> 29:46.000
I mean, she feels – if somebody says,

29:46.200 --> 29:48.040
“I want to come to your house for dinner,”

29:48.240 --> 29:50.640
she feels very happy. “Oh, that’s very good.

29:50.840 --> 29:52.640
Now then, what should I cook? What should I do?”

29:52.840 --> 29:55.600
This is a woman’s attitude.

29:56.840 --> 30:00.040
Once we had a group of people, about twenty-five

30:00.240 --> 30:01.840
of them had come to see Me.

30:02.040 --> 30:05.000
I was sitting with them in an open space,

30:05.200 --> 30:08.120
and then I sent word to My daughter that they are here and

30:08.320 --> 30:11.080
it might be late, so better prepare dinner for them.

30:11.280 --> 30:14.000
After the thing I said, “There dinner is for you, let's go.”

30:14.200 --> 30:16.320
They said, “How?” I said, “All right.”

30:16.520 --> 30:18.440
She was so overjoyed, My daughter.

30:18.640 --> 30:20.440
She had prepared all kinds of things,

30:20.720 --> 30:22.600
her friends also came to help her.

30:22.800 --> 30:25.560
And they were surprised, all these foreigners, that

30:25.760 --> 30:27.920
“How, Mother, she’s so happy about it?

30:28.120 --> 30:32.040
If I tell my wife” – that’s the beginning of Sahaja Yoga –

30:32.240 --> 30:35.120
“that even three persons are coming for dinner,

30:35.320 --> 30:38.280
she’d go round and round and round ...”

30:38.480 --> 30:42.080
I said, “Why?”

30:42.280 --> 30:44.560
“ … and she’d grudge and grumble,

30:44.760 --> 30:48.280
and she’d show all her temper with the people.”

30:49.680 --> 30:52.040
I was quite surprised.

30:54.360 --> 30:58.000
In Sahaja Yoga that’s how we live.

30:58.280 --> 31:01.040
We want to give love, and

31:02.520 --> 31:06.160
men have to appreciate that love and enjoy that love;

31:06.360 --> 31:09.240
whether you are a brother or a husband

31:09.440 --> 31:14.040
or a son, any way, the woman’s love is for you.

31:14.240 --> 31:18.720
And she gives you that love that makes you absolutely,

31:19.640 --> 31:23.400
not only joyous but also religious.

31:24.760 --> 31:27.120
Because it’s a relative thing.

31:27.320 --> 31:29.040
If a woman starts misbehaving,

31:29.240 --> 31:31.400
that’s the worst for the society:

31:31.760 --> 31:33.160
men also start misbehaving.

31:33.360 --> 31:35.480
Men, as it is, are extroverts.

31:35.680 --> 31:37.760
So to control them,

31:37.960 --> 31:41.000
put them as householders,

31:41.200 --> 31:44.880
women must know how to keep them.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.320
It’s not easy to run a house,

31:48.520 --> 31:51.760
it’s not easy to run your family,

31:52.120 --> 31:56.280
it’s not easy to look after your children – very difficult.

31:57.520 --> 32:01.200
And those who have those qualities are the best women

32:01.400 --> 32:04.880
and they really achieve it.

32:05.080 --> 32:09.000
I mean, you can think of your mothers,

32:09.240 --> 32:10.800
how much they loved you,

32:11.000 --> 32:12.880
all the men and the women.

32:13.120 --> 32:15.240
Why? Why do you think of your mother so much?

32:15.440 --> 32:18.680
Because she sacrificed everything,

32:18.880 --> 32:21.920
but without showing that she was sacrificing.

32:22.120 --> 32:25.320
She did so much for you, so you could...

32:26.880 --> 32:31.800
Woman’s potential to love is tremendous,

32:32.960 --> 32:34.680
tremendous!

32:34.880 --> 32:38.080
And this is what we have to learn from Fatima.

32:38.280 --> 32:41.840
She gave Her two children to be killed.

32:42.040 --> 32:46.480
She knew, because She was, after all, Vishnumaya.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.200
She was the incarnation of Vishnumaya.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.160
She knew Her children will be killed,

32:51.360 --> 32:53.240
but still She sent Her children,

32:53.760 --> 32:55.240
“All right. Doesn’t matter.

32:55.440 --> 33:01.040
Even if I know that they are going to die, it’s all right."

33:01.880 --> 33:04.640
Such bravery, such courage,

33:04.840 --> 33:10.160
such understanding of the duty of Her children.

33:10.360 --> 33:14.160
Today we remember them as Hassan and Hussein.

33:14.360 --> 33:17.560
Supposing She had said, “No, no, no, no, don’t go

33:17.760 --> 33:20.840
for the war. Stay at home.”

33:21.760 --> 33:24.840
And if She had forced them not to go,

33:25.040 --> 33:27.160
then they would not have gone.

33:27.360 --> 33:29.880
We would not have talked about them today, isn’t it?

33:30.080 --> 33:32.920
In any case, they would have been dead sometime,

33:33.120 --> 33:37.520
but the death of a hero they got because of their mother.

33:37.880 --> 33:40.640
Of course, they were also a kind of incarnations,

33:40.840 --> 33:45.040
but the way She gave them absolutely complete

33:45.240 --> 33:49.880
encouragement, “Go and fight for the right thing.”

33:50.960 --> 33:53.840
Because these fundamentalists

33:54.040 --> 33:57.320
were trying to bring their fanaticism.

33:59.040 --> 34:03.600
So today is a day I have to tell men also

34:03.800 --> 34:09.080
that you must learn to respect a woman who is chaste.

34:09.840 --> 34:13.560
Please understand, if your wife is a chaste woman,

34:13.760 --> 34:18.840
then you have no right, in no way to trouble her.

34:19.400 --> 34:22.040
Not that she should be respectable

34:22.240 --> 34:24.760
but you should see that everyone respects her,

34:24.960 --> 34:28.200
nobody insults her, should stand by her,

34:28.400 --> 34:30.800
be identified with her.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.600
But if she’s not a chaste woman

34:33.920 --> 34:37.360
and if she is that kind, better keep out.

34:37.800 --> 34:40.800
I do not have that much courage to say that

34:41.000 --> 34:43.480
“All right. Go ahead with her and I’ll look after.”

34:43.680 --> 34:45.320
It’s very difficult.

34:45.520 --> 34:48.960
I don’t know what complications might come.

34:49.160 --> 34:53.720
With all these experiences

34:54.320 --> 34:57.040
one learns one thing for definite,

34:57.240 --> 35:01.560
that woman is much more inward,

35:01.760 --> 35:04.880
she has much more powers,

35:05.080 --> 35:08.760
she is much more wiser than other people are,

35:08.960 --> 35:12.080
if she keeps to her chastity.

35:12.840 --> 35:17.520
That’s the point on which all her

35:17.720 --> 35:22.400
movement rotates, all her personality rotates.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.600
She may be anything.

35:24.800 --> 35:27.640
We had women – like there was a lady who was

35:27.840 --> 35:31.080
only seventeen years of age, and she became a widow.

35:31.280 --> 35:34.000
Widow she became at the age of seventeen,

35:34.200 --> 35:37.560
and she fought a very horrible king called as

35:37.760 --> 35:40.640
Aurangzeb, and she saw to it that he was battled;

35:41.000 --> 35:43.400
her name was Tarabai.

35:43.600 --> 35:46.520
We have women in India of different, different,

35:48.120 --> 35:50.800
say, characters in a way,

35:51.000 --> 35:53.840
fighting in different, different ways,

35:54.040 --> 35:57.400
but they were first and foremost were housewives.

35:58.840 --> 36:02.240
All their powers were there as housewives.

36:02.440 --> 36:05.680
So do not look down upon

36:07.000 --> 36:08.560
the housewife.

36:08.760 --> 36:10.760
When I’m traveling in the plane,

36:10.960 --> 36:12.800
they ask Me, “Mother, what is your profession?”

36:13.000 --> 36:15.240
“Housewife.”

36:15.800 --> 36:17.760
My profession is housewife.

36:17.960 --> 36:21.600
I’m a housewife of a very, very big family.

36:25.320 --> 36:27.800
I’m looking after My children,

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
I’m loving them, they love Me,

36:31.720 --> 36:37.680
and this profession is the best, I think,

36:37.880 --> 36:41.520
because it is so joy-giving,

36:42.960 --> 36:45.480
it’s so beautiful.

36:45.680 --> 36:47.320
It’s love.

36:47.520 --> 36:51.000
It’s so energy-giving.

36:53.120 --> 36:56.240
And at this age also I never feel My age,

36:56.440 --> 37:00.440
because I am the Mother of so many of you.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.800
And it never comes to My head that I’m old now

37:05.000 --> 37:07.720
and I must do so-and-so, I must take rest

37:07.920 --> 37:11.360
and I must not do this work or that...

37:13.600 --> 37:17.280
Because this feeling of love

37:17.480 --> 37:20.560
for My children: I have to nourish them,

37:20.760 --> 37:22.640
I have to look after them,

37:22.840 --> 37:25.680
because all My powers I have to give them.

37:25.880 --> 37:29.520
I never try to show off My powers to you in any way.

37:30.360 --> 37:33.200
It’s only you, who should imbibe all My powers.

37:33.400 --> 37:35.600
That’s the only desire I have,

37:35.800 --> 37:39.000
that you should be as powerful as Myself.

37:39.640 --> 37:42.520
Of course you discover it that I have powers,

37:42.720 --> 37:45.320
but as far as I am concerned

37:45.640 --> 37:49.080
I want that you should forget as to

37:49.280 --> 37:52.320
what powers I have, but you should yourself

37:52.520 --> 37:54.840
have all these powers within yourself,

37:55.040 --> 37:57.400
so that you can save the world.

37:57.600 --> 38:00.760
That’s the only thing I want to give you.

38:01.280 --> 38:05.040
And I want to assure you that you all can have

38:05.240 --> 38:07.880
everything that I have; only thing if you can retain –

38:08.080 --> 38:12.200
simple thing in life – that we have to be righteous people.

38:13.240 --> 38:17.320
We cannot play about, we cannot misbehave.

38:17.520 --> 38:20.000
Nowadays so many things are coming up,

38:20.200 --> 38:22.680
things that men are doing and women are doing;

38:22.880 --> 38:24.640
we are not.

38:24.920 --> 38:27.240
In the evolutionary process,

38:27.440 --> 38:30.560
as we may say that there were some monkeys - chimpanzees

38:30.760 --> 38:33.840
that became human beings. But no,

38:34.040 --> 38:36.040
in between there were some other human beings

38:36.240 --> 38:39.240
that came in, which vanished.

38:39.760 --> 38:43.080
So, very few people will become Sahaja Yogis,

38:43.280 --> 38:44.200
who will be saved.

38:44.400 --> 38:46.680
All the rest will be not there -

38:46.880 --> 38:50.000
they’ll be neither monkeys nor human beings, finished.

38:51.160 --> 38:54.600
These are all self-destroying things

38:54.920 --> 38:56.760
which kills the family,

38:56.960 --> 38:59.760
which kills the chastity within us,

38:59.960 --> 39:02.880
and then we are left high and dry.

39:03.520 --> 39:06.920
We are nowhere. We have diseases, we have troubles,

39:07.120 --> 39:10.640
we have problems. So be careful,

39:11.600 --> 39:13.280
very, very careful.

39:13.480 --> 39:18.080
And this special puja for

39:18.600 --> 39:20.120
Fatima Bi is

39:20.320 --> 39:21.920
puja of Vishnumaya.

39:22.120 --> 39:25.600
Also the guilt that works on the Left Vishuddhi

39:26.000 --> 39:30.280
can be cured if you develop your chastity.

39:30.480 --> 39:31.720
You’ll never feel guilty,

39:31.920 --> 39:34.080
because that’s such a virtue you have.

39:34.400 --> 39:37.800
In that virtue you will never, never feel guilty,

39:38.000 --> 39:40.880
and you can stand up to any nonsense

39:41.080 --> 39:45.320
because you are standing on the truth of chastity.

39:45.520 --> 39:48.760
Today it’s special day, I would say, when we are

39:48.960 --> 39:55.440
worshipping this great ideal of chastity that is Fatima Bi.

39:55.640 --> 39:58.640
May God bless you.
