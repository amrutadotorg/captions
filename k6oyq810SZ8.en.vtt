00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.567
But the second very bad curse

00:00:09.546 --> 00:00:14.075
of the Western acquisition instinct is

00:00:14.155 --> 00:00:19.155
that they want to acquire, aggress, others.

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:26.255
Aggression, the aggressiveness.

00:00:28.188 --> 00:00:31.275
They think they have a right to aggress other countries,

00:00:31.355 --> 00:00:35.141
I mean they aggressed our country 
for three hundred years.

00:00:35.221 --> 00:00:38.355
Why? Why did they aggress? 
We are not bad people.

00:00:39.155 --> 00:00:43.221
Because we had gold, we had diamonds,

00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:47.242
we had pearls,

00:00:47.322 --> 00:00:49.208
we had lots of things

00:00:49.288 --> 00:00:53.175
which were just material things for which they aggressed us,

00:00:53.255 --> 00:00:56.322
and they didn't take any spirituality from India.

00:00:57.221 --> 00:01:00.907
So the French aggressed, these aggressed, all the time aggressing.

00:01:00.987 --> 00:01:03.987
Japanese are also following you.

00:01:06.443 --> 00:01:09.430
This aggression then moves the whole society

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.430
into a very destructive force.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.151
You can see every day the wars are going on, 
this is fighting that, that is fighting that,

00:01:19.231 --> 00:01:21.464
they want this, they want that.

00:01:21.544 --> 00:01:24.430
And this aggression has also penetrated

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.303
the developing countries, the third world also.

00:01:27.383 --> 00:01:31.450
So, nicely the disease is on.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.410
But Kundalini kills that acquisition.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.410
How? By giving you joy.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.510
You enjoy everything.

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:53.430
You are sitting in a jungle, you are enjoying,

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.464
here in uncomfortable conditions, you enjoy

00:01:56.544 --> 00:02:00.430
because you seek the comfort of your spirit,

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.297
because that gives you joy

00:02:02.377 --> 00:02:05.497
- ultimately that's what you get out of everything.

00:02:05.577 --> 00:02:08.577
You think you get joy by acquisition; you do not.

00:02:11.104 --> 00:02:15.057
But through Kundalini awakening you get that joy,

00:02:15.137 --> 00:02:19.237
and in that joy you don't want anything,

00:02:21.137 --> 00:02:24.463
you don't ask for anything; you just enjoy yourself;

00:02:24.543 --> 00:02:28.677
you are the property of enjoyment.

00:02:28.757 --> 00:02:31.790
Sanskrit they say, “Atmanyeva atmane ahrushta”

00:02:32.336 --> 00:02:36.403
- “The Spirit is satisfied by its own spirit.”

00:02:40.323 --> 00:02:45.389
So into small things you must see joy,

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:50.550
and you must watch it, the whole universe, with that thing.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.029
I mean when I am traveling I'll ask,
“What is this tree?”

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.816
“Mother, we don't know.”
“Well, you lived here for so many years, you don't know?”

00:02:57.896 --> 00:02:59.923
“No Mother, we don't know much about trees.”

00:03:00.003 --> 00:03:02.438
I say, “What are these flowers?”
“We don't know.”

00:03:02.518 --> 00:03:06.610
I mean what are you doing, what have you been doing,
you don't know what are the trees,

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.782
every day you watch them;
you don't know what is the tree is?

00:03:13.204 --> 00:03:17.224
But if you ask them, “Where do you get this wine?” they will know.

00:03:17.304 --> 00:03:21.024
“Mother, this is the place where they produced the best wines.”

00:03:21.104 --> 00:03:27.456
“All right, I'll see to it.”
And next year they had no fermentation.

00:03:31.204 --> 00:03:36.024
So, this is the acquisition instinct which is very,

00:03:36.104 --> 00:03:40.038
sort of a, which becomes a political asset

00:03:40.118 --> 00:03:47.920
that you go and aggress other countries,
aggress other people and use all kinds of things.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.397
And that really is killing.

00:03:54.104 --> 00:03:57.124
So the whole attitude of human beings changes,

00:03:57.204 --> 00:03:58.690
they think we are the Lord,

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.057
we can hate anyone, we can aggress anyone,

00:04:02.137 --> 00:04:03.990
we could be arrogant with anyone,

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.396
we can demand anything, we can take away anybody's wife,

00:04:07.476 --> 00:04:12.410
take away anybody's child, take away 
anything, we can kill our children.

00:04:13.916 --> 00:04:18.884
As a result the love is lost;

00:04:18.964 --> 00:04:22.057
no question of compassion.

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:26.674
Love is lost, compassion is lost; no love.

00:04:28.223 --> 00:04:32.124
And with that you also developed “my” and “mine”,

00:04:32.204 --> 00:04:34.958
sense of “my and mine”

00:04:35.763 --> 00:04:39.024
- is that this is my child,

00:04:39.104 --> 00:04:41.453
this is my country,

00:04:42.104 --> 00:04:46.544
this is... As you know in Yugoslavia what they are doing.

00:04:46.624 --> 00:04:51.057
I don't know who gave the name of Yugo, Yugo means Yoga.

00:04:51.137 --> 00:04:55.224
This is the Yoga people, fighting among themselves.

00:04:55.304 --> 00:05:00.191
This has come from the same root that,

00:05:00.271 --> 00:05:05.381
“This is mine, this is my country”.
Why? How is it your country?

00:05:05.461 --> 00:05:08.496
You can't create one leaf, so who are you?

00:05:08.576 --> 00:05:12.709
You can't create little mud, can you?

00:05:14.482 --> 00:05:18.316
How do you say, “This is my country?” How dare?

00:05:18.396 --> 00:05:21.024
This all belongs to God.

00:05:21.104 --> 00:05:25.057
He has created, or you can say Adi Shakti has created.

00:05:25.137 --> 00:05:27.257
You have not created even so much;

00:05:27.337 --> 00:05:31.596
how do you say, “This is mine and I should have it?”

00:05:31.676 --> 00:05:37.057
So the “my” and “mine” thing also develops, very strong.

00:05:37.137 --> 00:05:41.506
And the same thing happens with, sometimes, Sahaja Yogis, very much.

00:05:41.586 --> 00:05:45.170
“My children”, this is the first curse.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:53.224
“These are my children, my wife, my family”,

00:05:54.616 --> 00:05:57.516
it starts growing like that.

00:05:59.296 --> 00:06:02.463
Then the heart shrinks.

00:06:03.457 --> 00:06:07.956
For a large-hearted man the whole world is the universe,

00:06:08.036 --> 00:06:11.570
the whole thing is within,

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.483
the whole thing is yours.

00:06:16.885 --> 00:06:21.224
When such a heart you experience within yourself

00:06:21.304 --> 00:06:23.690
then Kundalini just shoots off because,

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.404
as you know, the Sahasrara is the Heart Chakra.

00:06:27.304 --> 00:06:30.271
No question of Sahasrara catching

00:06:31.443 --> 00:06:33.477
if you have a large heart.

00:06:34.316 --> 00:06:37.057
And to keep the Sahasrara open

00:06:37.137 --> 00:06:42.090
- is just develop that sense, that wisdom,

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.324
that: "Nobody's mine, everybody belongs to God.

00:06:45.404 --> 00:06:47.404
Who is mine?

00:06:49.137 --> 00:06:51.237
Whatever God wants, let Him do."

00:06:51.894 --> 00:06:55.034
So get out of this small feeling.

00:06:55.114 --> 00:06:59.309
Sahaja Yogis do, I must say, I have seen it.

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:02.456
They get confined to their families.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.203
“My son hasn't got Realization,

00:07:06.283 --> 00:07:09.191
my brother hasn't got Realization, my this thing.”

00:07:09.271 --> 00:07:13.090
After that it moves, when they get Realization,

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:16.090
“This is my son, my brother, my sister, this thing.”

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:20.057
This “my” has to drop, which is very, very subtle thing,

00:07:20.137 --> 00:07:23.523
and that's why the Sahasrara catches.

00:07:23.603 --> 00:07:26.536
Everyone is yours

00:07:28.771 --> 00:07:36.804
because the Kundalini of Sahaja Yogis is made of love,

00:07:38.501 --> 00:07:40.769
pure love.

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:45.517
The pure love has only pure desire, is to love,

00:07:45.597 --> 00:07:48.631
love everyone equally.
