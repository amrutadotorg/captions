00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:15.711
Today we have gathered here to do
the Navaratri Puja.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.183
There were nine times when the major
incarnations

00:02:24.384 --> 00:02:29.323
of the Mother of this universe

00:02:31.825 --> 00:02:37.956
were manifested. They were manifested
with a purpose.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:48.145
That purpose is to protect Her bhaktas,
Her disciples, Her children.

00:02:48.417 --> 00:02:51.347
This was

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:07.210
a binding love, She could not escape it.

00:03:07.411 --> 00:03:12.982
Mother's love is binding, She cannot
escape it

00:03:13.183 --> 00:03:19.308
and She has to manifest it, work it out

00:03:19.516 --> 00:03:24.590
and give that protection to all
Her children.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.949
This protection in the modern times
has taken another form.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.356
In those days, the evil was trying

00:03:40.557 --> 00:03:46.704
to harm, to destroy the people who were
righteous,

00:03:46.905 --> 00:03:50.771
who were bhaktas, who were doing
good things,

00:03:50.972 --> 00:03:56.537
who wanted to lead a very religious life.

00:03:56.738 --> 00:04:02.305
So to save them, She incarnated.
To protect them, She incarnated.

00:04:02.506 --> 00:04:07.057
But they knew what was good, they knew
what was wrong.

00:04:08.154 --> 00:04:13.716
And they wanted to preserve their good
life, their precious life.

00:04:13.917 --> 00:04:17.640
They didn't care for money, they didn't
care for power,

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:21.582
but just they wanted their life,

00:04:21.783 --> 00:04:26.838
means they wanted to be alive to worship
the Goddess.

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:31.387
And when they were troubled or harmed
or destroyed

00:04:31.588 --> 00:04:35.088
by these evil forces, She had to manifest.

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:39.308
But in modern times it's become
very complicated

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.946
as the modern times are complicated.

00:04:43.154 --> 00:04:45.900
First of all,

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:52.717
in the mind, in the lifestyle,
in the society

00:04:52.918 --> 00:04:59.287
of good human beings, righteous human
beings,

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.469
fear of the wrong has entered.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.376
Like they are afraid say of their priests,
of their churches,

00:05:10.577 --> 00:05:15.030
of their temples, of their mosques,
which are all false.

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:19.243
They are not afraid of God, they don't
believe in God.

00:05:19.412 --> 00:05:24.599
They think they have created God and they
can manage God. So who is God?

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.738
The way they behave you can see clearly
that they do not recognize

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:34.486
the existence of God, God Almighty who is
a wrathful God.

00:05:34.687 --> 00:05:38.447
They are not at all worried as to what
will happen to them.

00:05:38.648 --> 00:05:43.444
They don't even believe in the second life,
they don't believe in the resurrection.

00:05:43.645 --> 00:05:50.163
They are very short-sighted, evil people
doing all kinds of evil things.

00:05:50.364 --> 00:05:54.884
So somehow or other, as soon as you
are born,

00:05:55.085 --> 00:05:58.611
you are born into some sort of a brand,

00:05:58.812 --> 00:06:04.304
you are this, you are that, you are that,
you are that, as soon as you are born.

00:06:04.505 --> 00:06:07.173
So the first brand comes onto this
modern man,

00:06:07.374 --> 00:06:11.926
is of what religion to which he belongs.

00:06:12.324 --> 00:06:18.184
He can't avoid it, he has to be jolly well
belonging to some religion.

00:06:18.385 --> 00:06:21.930
You go anywhere, even in the passport -
nowadays they have stopped it -

00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:26.791
otherwise they used to ask: "What is
your religion?"

00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:33.203
And in India if you said you had no
religion they would not give you a passport

00:06:33.404 --> 00:06:36.984
because you are not yet qualified
evil person,

00:06:37.185 --> 00:06:41.545
or you are not following qualified
evil people.

00:06:41.746 --> 00:06:50.195
So that very simple gullible good people,
very righteous believers of God,

00:06:50.396 --> 00:06:57.282
developed this kind of a fear which was put
into their heads by these false people.

00:06:57.483 --> 00:07:00.142
That if you don't do like this, if you
don't pay money to us,

00:07:00.343 --> 00:07:02.781
then God will be wrathful.

00:07:02.982 --> 00:07:11.790
If you do not come to the confession,
then God will be angry with you,

00:07:11.991 --> 00:07:16.122
if you do not tolerate our nonsense,
God will be angry with you.

00:07:16.323 --> 00:07:22.908
All these things started going into
the brains of the people very easily.

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:27.713
In some religion they believe there is
no sin in drinking.

00:07:27.914 --> 00:07:32.926
In some religion they believe there is
no sin in marrying many women.

00:07:33.127 --> 00:07:37.375
In some religion they believe that you
can have caste system.

00:07:37.576 --> 00:07:45.831
All is anti-God, absolutely anti-God
activity perpetuated into the society

00:07:46.032 --> 00:07:52.153
by these priests who are supposed to be
in charge of the religion.

00:07:52.354 --> 00:07:59.277
So the first horrible conditioning we have
when we start Sahaja Yoga is this.

00:08:01.724 --> 00:08:06.219
So to start something afresh they find it
very difficult.

00:08:07.491 --> 00:08:15.346
So the first protection Mother had
to render is from this conditioning.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.495
The second one is that of the country.

00:08:19.696 --> 00:08:23.405
Either you belong to this country,
to that country, or to that country.

00:08:23.606 --> 00:08:33.814
And these days every country is competing
with each other in all kinds of

00:08:36.171 --> 00:08:41.985
corruption, mafia, all kinds of things,
every country.

00:08:42.186 --> 00:08:45.019
Suddenly you discover.

00:08:45.712 --> 00:08:48.774
You have faith in one country, you find,
oh no, no, they were supporting

00:08:48.975 --> 00:08:53.357
certain person secretly.

00:08:53.558 --> 00:08:56.219
So whether they are democratic or anything,

00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:01.311
there is a kind of a mafia working
everywhere under some name.

00:09:01.512 --> 00:09:07.813
So the so-called laws also are only
for people who are simple, gullible,

00:09:08.014 --> 00:09:12.460
pure citizens, and not for the people
who put those laws on them.

00:09:12.661 --> 00:09:16.060
They take bribes, they take all kinds
of things, but still

00:09:16.261 --> 00:09:21.226
they are supposed to be in charge of law,
doing all kinds of illegal things,

00:09:21.427 --> 00:09:25.635
because they have made the law, so they
know how to be illegal.

00:09:25.836 --> 00:09:31.325
So this is the second type of fear that is
in the minds of the modern time.

00:09:31.526 --> 00:09:37.442
Then the third thing was the war.
Wars after wars came in,

00:09:37.643 --> 00:09:43.209
so many people developed a kind of a fear
about war,

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:48.693
and as a reaction they developed a kind
of a stupid ego,

00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:52.600
just they said, to protect themselves.

00:09:53.611 --> 00:09:59.646
In protection, themselves, they have
built up a big ego

00:09:59.847 --> 00:10:07.512
and they are now becoming very,
we should say, aggressive people.

00:10:09.696 --> 00:10:19.446
So this kind of a wider range,
I should say, of fear,

00:10:19.647 --> 00:10:25.825
it can be directed into any direction,
it can be directed towards anyone.

00:10:26.026 --> 00:10:33.973
Then comes - is the fear of race -
racialism.

00:10:34.174 --> 00:10:39.744
Now I'm told that neo-nazism is taking
its own course

00:10:39.945 --> 00:10:43.582
and is coming up like a little snake.

00:10:46.216 --> 00:10:52.063
So this is another area which is very
dangerous now, working out.

00:10:54.699 --> 00:10:59.812
Now in the minds of seekers -
in their seeking,

00:11:00.013 --> 00:11:02.570
they have been to many gurus, they have
read all kinds of books

00:11:02.771 --> 00:11:06.563
but they were seeking, you know.
They can, they were seeking, yet...

00:11:06.764 --> 00:11:10.113
drink any kind of water, develop all kinds
of diseases, what can you do?

00:11:10.314 --> 00:11:15.458
You are seeking after all, you are thirsty.
It has to be excused.

00:11:15.659 --> 00:11:18.426
And that's how they develop lots
of problems,

00:11:18.627 --> 00:11:21.762
not only in their body but also
in their brain.

00:11:21.963 --> 00:11:25.680
And now it's a very delicate thing.
If you tell somebody

00:11:25.881 --> 00:11:29.048
that you have been to such and such guru,
he doesn't want to hear

00:11:29.249 --> 00:11:32.591
because for him now the guru has become
the last word.

00:11:32.792 --> 00:11:35.913
You cannot say anything against his guru.

00:11:36.114 --> 00:11:39.662
Now when he starts suffering, then he may
accept,

00:11:39.863 --> 00:11:42.851
but to take it out that guru is also
very delicate

00:11:43.052 --> 00:11:47.248
because if you want to take out that guru,
then he might be hurt.

00:11:47.449 --> 00:11:51.237
So it's a very delicate operation.

00:11:52.675 --> 00:11:57.085
Then the modern society, the less said
the better.

00:11:57.286 --> 00:12:01.701
The norms of modern society are given
to us by people

00:12:01.902 --> 00:12:08.274
who were characterless like Freud, who had
no sense of morality,

00:12:08.475 --> 00:12:12.777
or by drunkards, though they don't have
any statues of drunkards.

00:12:12.978 --> 00:12:19.386
But most of them, if you see the abandonment
of our value system comes through drinking.

00:12:19.587 --> 00:12:22.740
And the drinking was there but not
to this extent, I mean,

00:12:22.941 --> 00:12:26.188
everybody was not a drunkard, these days
everybody can be a drunkard.

00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:29.428
And there's no shame about it.
With that drinking

00:12:29.599 --> 00:12:37.487
our value system started dropping down
and people have accepted now,

00:12:37.688 --> 00:12:42.274
the normal thing is abandonment.
This is another way.

00:12:44.918 --> 00:12:49.707
Formerly the parents used to support
the person if he would take to God,

00:12:49.908 --> 00:12:53.613
if he would take to righteous life
or to something higher.

00:12:53.814 --> 00:12:57.596
And if they saw these qualities in their
child they used to be happy,

00:12:57.797 --> 00:13:02.473
but these days the other way round,
the parents don't like it.

00:13:03.959 --> 00:13:07.513
As if the parents have lost everything
in themselves,

00:13:07.714 --> 00:13:13.034
so they want to hold on to their children,
grandchildren and possess them.

00:13:13.723 --> 00:13:17.266
And brainless creatures, because their
brain has been already washed out,

00:13:17.467 --> 00:13:23.224
there's nothing in their brains. To fight
the parents also is a big problem.

00:13:23.425 --> 00:13:27.125
So this kind of a fear is also there, that:
"My mother should not know,

00:13:27.326 --> 00:13:31.192
my father should not know," this, that.

00:13:31.964 --> 00:13:35.298
You can say from all sides

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:42.736
the fear is burning, like flames.

00:13:42.937 --> 00:13:50.219
And we are now here, in Kali Yuga, we have
started Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:53.157 --> 00:14:02.449
So the way we have to work out
our protection has to be mutual.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:09.351
Mother of course is there to protect you
all the time,

00:14:09.552 --> 00:14:12.740
Her powers are there to protect you.

00:14:12.941 --> 00:14:17.432
But surprisingly in the modern times,

00:14:17.633 --> 00:14:22.469
there's one condition which has to be
fulfilled.

00:14:24.279 --> 00:14:29.624
Because in those days good were good

00:14:29.825 --> 00:14:34.845
and evil were evil, there was no mixing up.

00:14:35.554 --> 00:14:38.478
So once they asked for Goddess, they
accepted Her,

00:14:38.679 --> 00:14:42.066
She came in Her real form and She worked
it out.

00:14:42.267 --> 00:14:47.187
But in modern times, you must know that
all these evil things

00:14:47.388 --> 00:14:51.696
are also lingering in your head, little bit
here and there.

00:14:51.897 --> 00:14:54.311
People are extremely superficial,

00:14:54.512 --> 00:15:01.709
they are very much prone to the mass
attitude, fashions, things like that.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:06.914
Sort of, their personality is not that
developed as that

00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:11.614
of those bhaktas who knew they were right,
who knew they were righteous,

00:15:11.815 --> 00:15:13.864
who knew whatever they were doing
was correct

00:15:14.065 --> 00:15:21.015
and were standing on their legs firm.

00:15:21.216 --> 00:15:30.028
So the modern Sahaja Yogi is very different
from the Sahaja Yogi of olden times.

00:15:30.229 --> 00:15:36.774
Because in the olden times it was not easy
to get Realization.

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:41.876
One in a billion, or in a trillion.

00:15:43.242 --> 00:15:47.970
And they had to work very hard, so as they
worked hard, very hard,

00:15:48.171 --> 00:15:52.996
they got cleansed and built up themselves,
you see, and toiled.

00:15:53.197 --> 00:15:57.931
Like any art piece which takes time,
is done with care,

00:15:58.102 --> 00:16:01.196
is definitely thousand times better than
these modern artists

00:16:01.397 --> 00:16:04.153
just putting two, three lines like this.

00:16:04.354 --> 00:16:08.649
So the today's human being is like a modern
artist, you see.

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:12.406
You put one line and you say: "You must
see this into that person,

00:16:12.607 --> 00:16:15.928
you must have an identity." I mean,
what identity people can have?

00:16:16.129 --> 00:16:20.614
With one line, you say, find out
the identity.

00:16:23.145 --> 00:16:27.767
So the Sahaja Yogis which are today here,
have to realize

00:16:27.968 --> 00:16:35.338
that all these things are surrounding us,
and these evil forces are also there.

00:16:35.539 --> 00:16:39.787
There are some within us, some are without.

00:16:40.376 --> 00:16:45.850
So it's a - looks to be very difficult
task, but it's not.

00:16:48.424 --> 00:16:53.533
Because one condition if you can
understand,

00:16:54.948 --> 00:16:58.339
is that you have to recognize Me.

00:16:58.548 --> 00:17:03.757
I know I am Mahamaya, I'm really very
clever at it.

00:17:09.551 --> 00:17:15.834
But I am truthful, I do not have crocodile
tears, I cannot have.

00:17:16.201 --> 00:17:21.814
I am truthful, but still I am Mahamaya.

00:17:22.015 --> 00:17:27.309
So to recognize Me what should we do?

00:17:28.208 --> 00:17:32.749
If we recognize then you are protected.

00:17:35.536 --> 00:17:42.872
And the cleansing is the simplest thing
in Sahaja Yoga is to be collective.

00:17:43.073 --> 00:17:49.236
If you are not collective then know that
something wrong with you.

00:17:49.563 --> 00:17:55.678
If you are collective then as if you are
taking your bath in the river Ganges.

00:17:55.879 --> 00:17:59.700
You don't have to go to Himalayas, you
don't have to do individual sadhana much,

00:17:59.901 --> 00:18:03.015
you don't have to... just be collective.
If you are collective,

00:18:03.216 --> 00:18:09.423
if you are enjoying the collective, then
you should know that you are clean.

00:18:09.624 --> 00:18:15.508
No blemishes there, you are absolutely
all right.

00:18:17.565 --> 00:18:22.547
Now the second part of is - this Mahamaya
business.

00:18:22.747 --> 00:18:27.243
I had to be very close to you, I had to be
extremely close,

00:18:27.444 --> 00:18:31.702
talk to you, to have a rapport, to tell you
everything about Yoga

00:18:31.903 --> 00:18:37.722
to make you absolutely aware of yourself.
This had to be done,

00:18:37.923 --> 00:18:41.536
and with all these complications within
your mind,

00:18:41.745 --> 00:18:47.200
within your heart, within your body, I had
to work it out.

00:18:47.401 --> 00:18:54.772
To come close in the real form would have
been very dangerous,

00:18:54.973 --> 00:19:00.945
so One had to be a Mahamaya. But
despite that,

00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:10.674
if you could recognize Me,
to understand Me,

00:19:10.875 --> 00:19:17.143
that I am Divine personality,
it's an Incarnation -

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:23.769
that's all the Deities want. Then they'll
look after you in every way.

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:29.054
They'll give you all the powers, they'll
give you all the satisfaction,

00:19:29.255 --> 00:19:35.115
all the protection that you want. This is
the condition

00:19:36.014 --> 00:19:39.728
which for a rational mind is very difficult
to understand,

00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:45.781
that how can Adi Shakti be in one body?

00:19:46.815 --> 00:19:51.196
How can the Infinite can become finite?

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:56.318
But human beings cannot do that.

00:19:57.002 --> 00:20:03.041
Only human beings. God can do it. He is God
after all.

00:20:04.265 --> 00:20:10.467
And if so, you have so many miracles,
you have so many photographs,

00:20:10.668 --> 00:20:16.435
so many things to see, but this is what
one has to recognize.

00:20:17.048 --> 00:20:21.796
Now I see people, when I talk to them

00:20:21.997 --> 00:20:26.992
they start talking to Me a little
frivolously,

00:20:27.193 --> 00:20:33.641
not with that depth, not with that feeling
that I am Mahamaya.

00:20:33.849 --> 00:20:38.624
Then some of them even answer Me. Some
of them, if I tell them something,

00:20:38.825 --> 00:20:45.003
they are ready to give an answer,
explanation.

00:20:45.204 --> 00:20:49.961
Of course this freedom I have given you
deliberately,

00:20:51.026 --> 00:20:58.716
but must understand that you have
to talk to Me

00:20:58.917 --> 00:21:05.580
in a way that is, you would talk
to Adi Shakti.

00:21:06.154 --> 00:21:08.655
Very important.

00:21:14.038 --> 00:21:20.939
Then how you behave is very important.
You should not be artificial,

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:27.233
you should not be superficial, but best is
to put your hand on your heart,

00:21:27.434 --> 00:21:33.003
both the hands, and just try to feel it.

00:21:33.981 --> 00:21:37.452
Your Mother is Adi Shakti.

00:21:37.922 --> 00:21:44.411
She has created all this Universe, She
has created all this world,

00:21:45.127 --> 00:21:52.875
She is for your protection. Even
Shri Krishna could not protect

00:21:53.751 --> 00:21:59.146
Pandavas - they had to go in the forest,
they had to suffer.

00:21:59.347 --> 00:22:02.887
But not Sahaja Yogis.

00:22:03.826 --> 00:22:10.277
As soon as I come to know about your
problems, My attention can work out.

00:22:10.478 --> 00:22:14.600
Shri Rama Himself had to go to jungles.

00:22:14.801 --> 00:22:23.081
All this is given to you, this protection,
because you are seekers of truth,

00:22:23.282 --> 00:22:31.546
and the truth is that I am the Adi Shakti
incarnated.

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:43.678
Once this truth becomes one with yourself

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:49.710
there is nothing to fear, because
all the Deities know this fact,

00:22:49.918 --> 00:22:54.823
they know about this Incarnation very well.
They are all prepared for it,

00:22:55.024 --> 00:23:03.945
and they'll do anything to substantiate
your belief.

00:23:04.685 --> 00:23:09.971
In every way they are trying to give you
My photographs, in the sky, this, that,

00:23:10.172 --> 00:23:14.816
I mean all sorts of things. God knows what
they are going to do today.

00:23:15.278 --> 00:23:18.229
They are so anxious.

00:23:18.523 --> 00:23:22.774
They are behind the stage, before
the stage, all sides of the stage,

00:23:22.975 --> 00:23:28.604
listening to Me, feeling happy that I am
telling you the truth.

00:23:28.805 --> 00:23:36.025
But the way they recognize and the way
they act, they never disobey.

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:43.000
If you behave in the same manner

00:23:43.201 --> 00:23:48.844
you are completely protected from all these
problems I have told you about.

00:23:50.505 --> 00:23:56.821
Now I won't say you shouldn't hate anyone,
you shouldn't do.., nothing of the kind.

00:24:00.204 --> 00:24:04.290
I wouldn't say you should not steal
something.

00:24:04.491 --> 00:24:10.898
I wouldn't say that you make money, don't
make money out of Sahaja Yoga, nothing.

00:24:11.099 --> 00:24:15.109
I don't even say don't drink, don't smoke,
I never said so.

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:20.179
But automatically once you know whom
you are facing,

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:24.580
in whose protection you are, automatically
you will do that.

00:24:24.781 --> 00:24:27.695
Automatically. You will have no fear.

00:24:27.896 --> 00:24:32.636
Once you have recognized you will have
no fear from anyone.

00:24:32.837 --> 00:24:40.445
And the more you show that recognition,
the more you realize it,

00:24:40.646 --> 00:24:46.642
you get higher and higher. Not only
spiritually,

00:24:46.843 --> 00:24:53.015
but every way - mentally, socially,
economically, politically.

00:24:55.834 --> 00:24:59.212
It's very remarkable

00:25:00.745 --> 00:25:06.989
that not only that you recognize Me
as a Mother who loves you very much,

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:14.846
but a Mother who is powerful to protect
you, She’s very powerful.

00:25:18.141 --> 00:25:22.582
If you realize that, and if you feel that
within your heart,

00:25:22.783 --> 00:25:27.952
supposing I correct you sometime, instead
of feeling sad you should see it

00:25:28.153 --> 00:25:32.417
that "How fortunate I am that Adi Shakti
Herself is correcting me.

00:25:32.618 --> 00:25:35.922
She is taking interest in me.

00:25:36.123 --> 00:25:40.727
How fortunate I am to be born at this time,

00:25:40.928 --> 00:25:47.187
to be with Her in Her great work, what
have I done?"

00:25:49.927 --> 00:25:58.135
This recognition itself will fulfil all
the incarnations of Navaratri.

00:25:58.336 --> 00:26:04.139
So today we are worshipping the Durga,
Kali,

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:08.863
all these great Goddesses, these Powers,
even Radha.

00:26:09.064 --> 00:26:12.236
It was Radha who killed Kamsa not
Shri Krishna.

00:26:12.452 --> 00:26:19.099
He had to ask Radha to come and kill him.
It's the Power that kills.

00:26:25.837 --> 00:26:30.330
So if you realize

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:37.544
that your Mother is the Adi Shakti.

00:26:37.745 --> 00:26:40.989
I know of so many people.

00:26:41.625 --> 00:26:46.335
There's one gentleman who is working
in London airport.

00:26:46.702 --> 00:26:49.197
Somebody tried to trouble him. He said:
"You see, be careful of?ah...

00:26:49.398 --> 00:26:52.756
my Mother is very powerful, you don't
know."

00:26:52.925 --> 00:26:58.095
Next day that man lost his job, lost
his business, lost this, lost this,

00:26:58.296 --> 00:27:03.465
and he came to him and said: "Now which
is your Mother, let me see Her?"

00:27:08.584 --> 00:27:15.122
There was a farmer in, near Rahuri,

00:27:15.323 --> 00:27:22.215
and in the night three men came to steal
some sugar cane.

00:27:23.662 --> 00:27:30.834
And next day they came and they said:
"Which Goddess do you worship?"

00:27:31.035 --> 00:27:40.104
He said: "Why?". "There were three hefty
people watching your - guarding your field,

00:27:40.312 --> 00:27:43.570
and we came just to... and we thought,
better take some of this sugar cane,

00:27:43.771 --> 00:27:51.097
after all, it looks so nice, and they beat
us. Of course we never got hurt."

00:27:54.434 --> 00:27:59.497
So just behind this recognition is
all the powers.

00:27:59.698 --> 00:28:03.812
There's so many, so many stories I can
tell you,

00:28:04.013 --> 00:28:08.038
how things have happened, how it has
worked out.

00:28:10.905 --> 00:28:18.234
But if you are doubting, still halfway,
this, that, then things won't be all right.

00:28:20.093 --> 00:28:23.339
You shouldn't worry about your reputation.

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:30.811
Just go with full speed into any direction,
knowing one thing -

00:28:31.012 --> 00:28:39.722
that you are My child, and that I am
Adi Shakti.

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.072
Everything that looks horrible will become
better.

00:28:44.273 --> 00:28:49.616
We have seen it now in this France case,
and all that, what has happened.

00:28:49.817 --> 00:28:54.798
Don't worry about anything, just know that

00:28:56.767 --> 00:28:59.574
I am the Adi Shakti.

00:28:59.775 --> 00:29:06.842
That all the powers of Gods and Goddesses
and all that are within Me,

00:29:07.043 --> 00:29:11.243
and they are within Me, and they are all
looking after you.

00:29:11.444 --> 00:29:17.079
But if that recognition is not there, they
are not going to recognize you either.

00:29:23.501 --> 00:29:28.829
So for today's Navaratri I have to tell you
that just try to keep in mind

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:34.692
that today you are worshipping
the Adi Shakti and not only Durga.

00:29:36.449 --> 00:29:40.867
And you are worshipping Durga and all
these Goddesses to thank them.

00:29:41.068 --> 00:29:44.914
Because if they had not saved you that time
you would have been so frightened,

00:29:45.115 --> 00:29:48.911
you would have become bad people and
you would not have been here.

00:29:49.112 --> 00:29:53.090
That is why we are thankful to them
for saving us

00:29:53.299 --> 00:29:59.817
and giving us this protection at that time
when we were very helpless.

00:30:04.986 --> 00:30:07.856
May God bless you all.
