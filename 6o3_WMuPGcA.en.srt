1
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:11,340
Today we are going to do the worship of Shri Krishna.

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,100
Shri Krishna came at a time on this earth

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:26,140
when in India the people were very much ritualistic.

4
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:33,980
They had become slaves of the so-called Brahmins

5
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,260
who had no idea about God at all

6
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,140
because they started a theme

7
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:47,140
that a Brahmin can have a Brahmin son.

8
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:54,540
So, the birth determined the caste of a person.

9
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,700
Before that,

10
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:03,980
it was not that a Brahmin would have a Brahmin as his son.

11
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,780
It’s also true that if you are a Realized soul,

12
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,460
in the real sense, if you are a really Realized soul,

13
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,580
then you must have a child which is a Realized soul.

14
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,100
And that is how also

15
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,140
if it was said that if the father is a Brahmin, is a Realized soul,

16
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,940
his son also becomes a Brahmin.

17
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,620
Because you are a Sahaja Yogi now you can understand

18
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:34,540
that a Sahaja Yogi’s son normally becomes a Sahaja Yogi.

19
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,340
So it was agreed that

20
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:43,700
children of a Brahmin will be called as a Brahmin.

21
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,900
Gradually, it amounted to this

22
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,740
that any child born out

23
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,060
of a Brahmin was called as Brahmin.

24
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,940
Now, we have seen that many Sahaja Yogis also don’t have

25
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,660
Realized souls as their children.

26
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,940
Maybe their own karmas,

27
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,260
maybe the child, anything it is,

28
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:07,620
but even I have seen some Sahaja Yogis having horribly

29
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,020
devilish children.

30
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:20,700
So, it shows that it is not through your birth

31
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,180
you can claim that you are a Brahmin

32
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,660
or the one who has known the Brahma.

33
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,500
Brahma is the All-pervading power.

34
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,020
So you have to be a Brahmin by your karma,

35
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,860
by what you do.

36
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:42,300
That is how we have got Valmiki who was just a fisherman.

37
00:02:42,572 --> 00:02:45,045
He wrote Ramayana, he was a great Brahmin.

38
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:48,232
Then you have got Vyasa who wrote Gita.

39
00:02:48,353 --> 00:02:55,326
He was an illegitimate son of a fisherwoman and he wrote Gita.

40
00:02:55,806 --> 00:03:02,406
So this idea was flouted by Shri Krishna's incarnation.

41
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:07,446
He wanted to flout this idea that Brahmins are the ones

42
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:10,646
who can only worship God.

43
00:03:11,046 --> 00:03:16,846
So to put another extreme

44
00:03:17,086 --> 00:03:21,046
to what Rama has created,

45
00:03:21,726 --> 00:03:23,966
to bring people into the centre,

46
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:28,006
because through Rama they went to another rigid form

47
00:03:28,326 --> 00:03:30,406
and rigidity of ritualism

48
00:03:30,726 --> 00:03:36,486
and too much of fundamentalism.

49
00:03:36,806 --> 00:03:38,486
So to put an end to that

50
00:03:38,726 --> 00:03:41,526
he wanted to bring the society to another extreme.

51
00:03:41,726 --> 00:03:47,566
Of course Shri Rama himself incarnated as Shri Krishna.

52
00:03:47,926 --> 00:03:52,326
So he started a new theme of,

53
00:03:52,526 --> 00:03:58,766
which was absolutely eventual, it was just absolutely evolutionary

54
00:03:58,966 --> 00:04:01,366
that such a new theme should come up.

55
00:04:01,606 --> 00:04:06,566
And this new theme was that the whole thing is nothing but a Leela.

56
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:09,766
It's just a play, it's a Leela.

57
00:04:10,006 --> 00:04:13,526
So not to be taken that seriously, not to be so rigid,

58
00:04:13,726 --> 00:04:20,206
not to be fundamental, not to be so particular about something.

59
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,926
So, the whole thing is a Leela.

60
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:27,526
And on this theme he worked out everything

61
00:04:27,846 --> 00:04:30,886
to establish that it is a play.

62
00:04:31,566 --> 00:04:34,526
And that is what you see in America,

63
00:04:34,726 --> 00:04:37,886
very common that for people it has become a joke,

64
00:04:38,126 --> 00:04:40,646
life has become a joke.

65
00:04:40,926 --> 00:04:43,606
And they think that life is not to be taken seriously,

66
00:04:43,846 --> 00:04:47,886
there is more fun in doing all kinds of things

67
00:04:48,126 --> 00:04:54,006
than in getting into any kind of inhibitions, as they call it,

68
00:04:54,246 --> 00:04:59,726
or maybe some sort of forms or patterns.

69
00:05:00,086 --> 00:05:02,966
But it is a myth with Americans now

70
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:06,006
because for that you have to have Shri Krishna,

71
00:05:06,246 --> 00:05:08,046
you have to have realisation.

72
00:05:08,286 --> 00:05:11,086
Like if you are standing in the water,

73
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:18,286
the waves of the water are there absolutely real for you and you,

74
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:24,206
if you think it's a illusion you'll be completely finished.

75
00:05:24,886 --> 00:05:28,326
The illusion will prove that it's not an illusion

76
00:05:28,526 --> 00:05:30,606
by asserting itself.

77
00:05:30,846 --> 00:05:32,726
But if you're in the boat

78
00:05:33,006 --> 00:05:36,886
then the water that is around is an illusion.

79
00:05:37,126 --> 00:05:39,566
So, it's the state at which you are.

80
00:05:39,846 --> 00:05:44,246
If you are in the state of self-realised mind,

81
00:05:44,446 --> 00:05:48,846
then everything is an illusion, but otherwise it is not.

82
00:05:49,086 --> 00:05:52,926
It is a reality. So, what they forgot this point,

83
00:05:53,126 --> 00:05:56,166
that you are not in that state to call it an illusion.

84
00:05:56,446 --> 00:06:00,286
So to call everything an illusion is just to delude yourself,

85
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:02,046
thinking that it's an illusion

86
00:06:02,246 --> 00:06:06,246
and doesn't matter, what's wrong, so what.

87
00:06:07,606 --> 00:06:10,366
It's quite symbolic that in Shri Krishna's place

88
00:06:10,566 --> 00:06:11,926
this thing should be so

89
00:06:12,126 --> 00:06:15,486
commonly accepted that everything is an illusion.

90
00:06:15,686 --> 00:06:18,926
So who is wrong, who is bad, nothing is wrong.

91
00:06:19,126 --> 00:06:22,926
There is nothing like evil, nothing like good.

92
00:06:23,206 --> 00:06:25,326
And some people go to that limit to say

93
00:06:25,526 --> 00:06:28,286
that there's nothing like a bhoot, nothing like a rakshasa,

94
00:06:28,526 --> 00:06:30,806
nothing like a evil force.

95
00:06:31,086 --> 00:06:34,726
Now for Shri Krishna how did he look at things was this way

96
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:40,806
that for him even to kill a rakshasa was a play.

97
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:46,086
To destroy a rakshasa was also a play.

98
00:06:46,926 --> 00:06:50,846
In that play he was to be destroyed.

99
00:06:51,486 --> 00:06:56,926
So, he discriminated in a way that what play is to be destroyed,

100
00:06:57,126 --> 00:06:59,526
what not to be destroyed.

101
00:06:59,726 --> 00:07:03,166
The play of the evil he destroyed by his own play.

102
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:06,006
So, to say there was nothing evil is also wrong.

103
00:07:06,206 --> 00:07:09,366
Like even if you think everything is a play,

104
00:07:09,566 --> 00:07:13,806
what happens that your attitude towards it is like a spectator.

105
00:07:14,086 --> 00:07:16,846
You see the whole thing as a spectator,

106
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:18,606
like in a drama you sit down

107
00:07:18,846 --> 00:07:20,926
and you watch everything as a spectator,

108
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:27,086
but you know what is depicting tragedy and what is depicting comedy.

109
00:07:27,486 --> 00:07:31,566
You are not inert to that then you are good for nothing.

110
00:07:31,806 --> 00:07:34,966
That doesn't mean that you become inert to that.

111
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,606
You have a sense of discretion to know

112
00:07:37,806 --> 00:07:40,366
what is a comedy and what is a tragedy.

113
00:07:40,606 --> 00:07:45,166
But if you are an actor, then to you it is not,

114
00:07:45,686 --> 00:07:50,166
it is not a comedy or a tragedy, it is a work for you.

115
00:07:50,406 --> 00:07:53,566
If you're acting then you're acting and you're an actor,

116
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,886
you're involved in it. So, it is not,

117
00:07:57,206 --> 00:07:58,926
for you do not know the discretion

118
00:07:59,126 --> 00:08:00,726
between the tragedy and the comedy.

119
00:08:00,926 --> 00:08:04,006
For you, you're just an actor as long as you're paid well,

120
00:08:04,246 --> 00:08:07,726
if you do your job well then, it's a comedy,

121
00:08:07,926 --> 00:08:10,806
otherwise it's a tragedy.

122
00:08:11,326 --> 00:08:15,086
So, there are two types of awareness, now of one of a spectator,

123
00:08:15,326 --> 00:08:18,926
another of the one who is in it.

124
00:08:19,246 --> 00:08:21,886
So, one has to understand in that light,

125
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:25,046
that when Krishna said the whole thing is a play,

126
00:08:25,246 --> 00:08:30,286
he was meaning for him, not for others.

127
00:08:30,846 --> 00:08:32,286
For him it is a play.

128
00:08:32,486 --> 00:08:36,286
And that's why when they talk to you about the play and the illusion

129
00:08:36,486 --> 00:08:39,646
you must tell them then why did he kill Kamsa.

130
00:08:39,846 --> 00:08:42,646
Why did he kill Jarasandha?

131
00:08:42,846 --> 00:08:48,166
Why did he kill all the people who were following Kamsa?

132
00:08:48,526 --> 00:08:51,806
So, to him it was a play, everything was a play

133
00:08:52,006 --> 00:08:56,726
and he did it in his own attitude of a play.

134
00:08:57,206 --> 00:09:02,046
So, the first thing if you are

135
00:09:02,366 --> 00:09:04,526
awakened by Shri Krishna's powers,

136
00:09:04,726 --> 00:09:09,046
then the first thing that should happen to you is wisdom.

137
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:14,126
Now the wisdom is something you cannot describe.

138
00:09:14,326 --> 00:09:16,686
You cannot say what is wisdom.

139
00:09:16,926 --> 00:09:20,806
It's very difficult to describe it or to delimit it.

140
00:09:21,006 --> 00:09:24,366
Wisdom is a temperament,

141
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,846
is a quality of a personality

142
00:09:28,206 --> 00:09:33,206
which comes to you by balancing yourself, by trial and error method.

143
00:09:33,446 --> 00:09:37,446
All traditional countries innately have much more wisdom than people

144
00:09:37,686 --> 00:09:39,446
who are not traditional.

145
00:09:39,686 --> 00:09:42,566
But Krishna broke all the traditions.

146
00:09:42,766 --> 00:09:45,886
That's why you people are here without much tradition.

147
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:50,126
He broke all the traditions, but he was Shri Krishna,

148
00:09:50,326 --> 00:09:52,846
so he did not need any tradition at all.

149
00:09:53,046 --> 00:09:56,206
But for you, you have to understand from the people

150
00:09:56,406 --> 00:09:58,566
who have tradition what is wisdom.

151
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:03,006
So, we do trial and error. We make mistakes, from that we learn.

152
00:10:03,246 --> 00:10:08,526
But when the ego is so strong in a country like America,

153
00:10:08,726 --> 00:10:13,406
when we do wrong, we do not want to accept it was wrong,¨

154
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:20,286
it was against our ascent, it was against our higher goals.

155
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,326
We get satisfied with the lower goals,

156
00:10:22,566 --> 00:10:26,966
like I've seen people who do some funny things in Sahaja Yoga.

157
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:31,046
They don't realise that this is absolutely against them,

158
00:10:31,406 --> 00:10:34,446
whatever they are doing is against them, they should not do this,

159
00:10:34,646 --> 00:10:37,206
it was wrong to do it. On the contrary,

160
00:10:37,406 --> 00:10:38,846
they catch on the left Vishuddhi

161
00:10:39,046 --> 00:10:42,286
that is another catch they have on the Vishuddhi chakra.

162
00:10:42,646 --> 00:10:46,606
So, because you're indiscreet, you do wrong things.

163
00:10:46,886 --> 00:10:51,406
To develop discretion, outcome of all this is discretion.

164
00:10:51,606 --> 00:10:54,566
You make mistakes. When you make mistakes,

165
00:10:54,766 --> 00:10:55,686
instead of

166
00:10:55,886 --> 00:10:58,046
developing the discretionabout it that this was a mistake,

167
00:10:58,246 --> 00:11:00,846
next time we should not do it, facing up to it,

168
00:11:01,046 --> 00:11:04,726
what we do is to feel guilty about it, so you escape it,

169
00:11:04,926 --> 00:11:07,966
spoiling the other chakra also.

170
00:11:08,206 --> 00:11:15,886
That is how people get a problem on the left Vishuddhi,

171
00:11:16,406 --> 00:11:18,726
and left Vishuddhi is that you feel guilty.

172
00:11:18,966 --> 00:11:22,926
It's very good to feel guilty than to do anything about it.

173
00:11:23,446 --> 00:11:25,686
That's the best way to escape it.

174
00:11:25,966 --> 00:11:30,366
Actually we have seen that mostly left Vishuddhi comes from ego.

175
00:11:30,686 --> 00:11:33,286
When ego is too much, you can't bear your ego,

176
00:11:33,486 --> 00:11:36,246
so you put it in the guilty side of it,

177
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:40,166
and you say, "I'm very guilty, I should not have done it."

178
00:11:40,446 --> 00:11:41,486
Now the another side

179
00:11:41,686 --> 00:11:44,526
which is also very dangerous is the right Vishuddhi.

180
00:11:44,726 --> 00:11:46,806
Right Vishuddhi is the one by which

181
00:11:47,046 --> 00:11:51,366
we try to justify all our indiscreet behaviour.

182
00:11:52,126 --> 00:11:54,926
So, "What's wrong?"

183
00:11:56,606 --> 00:12:00,326
"What is wrong in this?" "So what!"

184
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,286
All these things are right Vishuddhi problems.

185
00:12:03,526 --> 00:12:07,926
So, it's very common you tell somebody that it is wrong to do,

186
00:12:08,126 --> 00:12:10,286
for example they paint their hair.

187
00:12:10,526 --> 00:12:13,926
You tell them, "Don't do this, it will spoil your eyes,"

188
00:12:14,126 --> 00:12:19,086
they will say, "So what, we have a right to spoil ourselves,

189
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,806
we have a right to destroy ourselves," as if they are Shri Krishna,

190
00:12:22,006 --> 00:12:25,006
that they can destroy themselves, can they?

191
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:31,726
They cannot even create a little ant,

192
00:12:32,006 --> 00:12:35,646
leave alone ant, they can't even create a stone.

193
00:12:36,086 --> 00:12:38,406
And how do they have right to destroy themselves?

194
00:12:38,646 --> 00:12:40,086
So, this is the right side thing

195
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:46,606
where we think that we have the right to destroy.

196
00:12:48,246 --> 00:12:51,926
As I told you about eyes yesterday, it's very important

197
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:56,526
that eyes are the ones

198
00:12:56,726 --> 00:12:59,566
which gives you the play of Shri Krishna,

199
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:01,366
the power of Shri Krishna.

200
00:13:01,646 --> 00:13:06,886
Even a glance, a little glance of a person

201
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,846
who has Krishna consciousness, as they call it,

202
00:13:10,046 --> 00:13:11,726
if he has Krishna consciousness,

203
00:13:11,926 --> 00:13:14,686
then should be able to awaken the Kundalini,

204
00:13:14,886 --> 00:13:18,286
should be able to redeem, should be able to comfort,

205
00:13:18,526 --> 00:13:19,966
should be able to cure anyone.

206
00:13:20,206 --> 00:13:22,846
Even a glance, a side glance can do it,

207
00:13:23,086 --> 00:13:24,886
if it has Krishna consciousness,

208
00:13:25,126 --> 00:13:28,966
but not self-certified ones who say, "We are Krishna consciousness,"

209
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:33,486
all the time taking the name of Shri Krishna or any mantra.

210
00:13:33,726 --> 00:13:38,006
So, on the left hand side the escape is feeling guilty.

211
00:13:38,246 --> 00:13:39,286
When you feel guilty,

212
00:13:39,526 --> 00:13:42,526
they try to find out some method of expression.

213
00:13:42,726 --> 00:13:44,526
So they say they go to some guru

214
00:13:44,726 --> 00:13:47,326
and then the guru gives them some sort of a mantra,

215
00:13:47,566 --> 00:13:50,006
and they accept that mantra, they go on saying.

216
00:13:50,206 --> 00:13:53,926
As a result of that they catch more on the left Vishuddhi.

217
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:57,166
Because if you go on saying mantra without the connection,

218
00:13:57,366 --> 00:13:59,686
you get completely caught-up.

219
00:13:59,886 --> 00:14:02,086
So the left Vishuddhi is again gone

220
00:14:02,326 --> 00:14:05,766
and your mantras are absolutely useless, they're destroying them.

221
00:14:06,006 --> 00:14:09,526
Actually many people I've seen who get to heart attacks,

222
00:14:09,726 --> 00:14:14,926
who get anginas and also who get cancer

223
00:14:15,126 --> 00:14:17,286
are the people who have been doing mantras like this,

224
00:14:17,486 --> 00:14:20,166
without the connection with the Divine.

225
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:23,046
If you're not connected, say for example this is not connected

226
00:14:23,246 --> 00:14:26,046
and I start using it too much, it will get spoilt.

227
00:14:26,246 --> 00:14:29,566
In the same way the centre on the left hand side gets spoilt

228
00:14:29,806 --> 00:14:34,966
when you start saying any mantra without being connected,

229
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:39,646
without feeling the power of that mantra.

230
00:14:40,326 --> 00:14:42,486
So, in Sahaja Yoga we've got mantras

231
00:14:42,686 --> 00:14:45,446
to neutralise these mantras on the left hand side.

232
00:14:45,686 --> 00:14:48,046
Right hand side comes when we talk big.

233
00:14:48,286 --> 00:14:51,566
It's a common thing with your politicians, they talk very big.

234
00:14:51,806 --> 00:14:53,486
They think they're very responsible people

235
00:14:53,686 --> 00:14:55,806
and do all irresponsible things.

236
00:14:56,006 --> 00:14:58,526
So, when you want to spoil that chakra,

237
00:14:58,726 --> 00:15:02,726
one has to do some irresponsible talk.

238
00:15:02,926 --> 00:15:07,366
So like that we can say, "I will do this for you, I will do that.

239
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:13,486
I like it, I can find this, I can manage this," finished.

240
00:15:14,286 --> 00:15:17,286
When you start saying in the ego form that,

241
00:15:17,526 --> 00:15:22,726
"I have to do this, I will do this," then our ego shows up.

242
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:27,086
But on the contrary, if you say, "I have to do for you, Father;

243
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:31,166
I have to do for you, Mother, it's your work I'm doing,"

244
00:15:31,446 --> 00:15:33,046
then the whole thing disappears

245
00:15:33,286 --> 00:15:37,326
and you get that beautiful thing called surrender which is Islam.

246
00:15:37,566 --> 00:15:40,006
Islam is nothing but surrender.

247
00:15:40,246 --> 00:15:44,046
So you surrender yourself by saying, "This is your work, Father;

248
00:15:44,286 --> 00:15:49,006
I'm working for you, I'm your instrument, I'm your flute."

249
00:15:49,246 --> 00:15:52,046
So, you play the melody of God.

250
00:15:52,246 --> 00:15:56,526
But for that also the central point of discretion has to be used.

251
00:15:56,766 --> 00:15:59,086
Every time you go back to discretion.

252
00:15:59,286 --> 00:16:01,726
Like some people do all kinds of wrong things

253
00:16:01,966 --> 00:16:05,006
and they say, "Mother, we did it for you." How can it be?

254
00:16:05,246 --> 00:16:06,846
Like somebody wants to drink.

255
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:12,366
He says, "I got drunk because Mother I wanted to help you."

256
00:16:13,326 --> 00:16:16,326
Or Hitler can say that, "I killed so many people

257
00:16:16,606 --> 00:16:21,406
because I wanted to remove all the Jews who killed Christ."

258
00:16:22,086 --> 00:16:26,846
So, this right Vishuddhi gives you a kind of a mind

259
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:32,886
which tries to justify everything and tries to explain everything.

260
00:16:33,086 --> 00:16:36,126
Every action can be explained. "Why did you murder?" "Because this."

261
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:38,086
"Why did you do that?" "Because of this."

262
00:16:38,326 --> 00:16:41,206
Once you start justifying your wrong deeds,

263
00:16:41,406 --> 00:16:44,326
right Vishuddhi goes up to your brain.

264
00:16:44,566 --> 00:16:47,246
And then whatever you do has a justification.

265
00:16:47,486 --> 00:16:52,726
Like, if I say that the Americans came to this country,

266
00:16:52,926 --> 00:16:54,846
they actually robbed the other people of their land

267
00:16:55,046 --> 00:16:57,406
and now very nicely settled down.

268
00:16:57,646 --> 00:16:58,886
Now, when I say that,

269
00:16:59,126 --> 00:17:01,606
immediately most of them will go to the left Vishuddhi.

270
00:17:01,846 --> 00:17:05,846
"Oh, we are very guilty, we did this, we did that."

271
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:08,366
But a real Sahaja Yogi won't do that.

272
00:17:08,606 --> 00:17:11,006
A real Sahaja Yogi, what he will do, he'll say, "Alright,

273
00:17:11,246 --> 00:17:14,006
this is done by my fore-fathers, I did not do it.

274
00:17:14,246 --> 00:17:19,526
But I can try to rectify it, I'll try to be beyond racialism;

275
00:17:19,726 --> 00:17:22,286
I'll look after these people who have been robbed,

276
00:17:22,486 --> 00:17:25,006
I'll try to give them whatever is possible."

277
00:17:25,246 --> 00:17:28,406
This is the way you face and not just to say,

278
00:17:28,606 --> 00:17:32,886
"Oh, I'm so guilty that my fore-fathers did this and all that."

279
00:17:33,126 --> 00:17:35,366
But what are you doing about it?

280
00:17:35,606 --> 00:17:39,166
Like I went to Switzerland and I said, "Don't feel guilty."

281
00:17:39,366 --> 00:17:42,886
So one lady said that "I'm feeling guilty for Vietnam."

282
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:45,206
I said, "What did you do there?

283
00:17:45,446 --> 00:17:47,846
Why are you feeling guilty for Vietnam, of all the things,

284
00:17:48,086 --> 00:17:50,486
at least you did not go to fight there.

285
00:17:50,686 --> 00:17:52,326
Why did you feel guilty about it?"

286
00:17:52,566 --> 00:17:54,686
So she says, "I'm feeling just guilty

287
00:17:54,886 --> 00:17:59,846
because I think we have done a wrong thing."

288
00:18:00,126 --> 00:18:02,486
I said, "But how do call yourself 'we'?"

289
00:18:02,686 --> 00:18:07,086
So this is also another point which comes out of indiscretion

290
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:12,206
that we suddenly become a personality

291
00:18:12,446 --> 00:18:15,566
which is a part and parcel of the whole.

292
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:20,606
So we think that "Oh, we Americans are of the world."

293
00:18:20,806 --> 00:18:23,846
Alright, how?

294
00:18:24,206 --> 00:18:29,046
The day you become the world most of the problems will be solved.

295
00:18:29,326 --> 00:18:32,966
They're the greatest headaches, like Russians are.

296
00:18:33,206 --> 00:18:35,726
Both are headaches to the whole world.

297
00:18:35,966 --> 00:18:39,126
If they become the whole world, there's no problem,

298
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:43,286
there's no problem, because then they become the love.

299
00:18:43,606 --> 00:18:50,046
But just assuming a situation where we think, we are, we.

300
00:18:50,486 --> 00:18:55,246
Who are the 'we'?  Husband and wife can't live together.

301
00:18:55,526 --> 00:18:57,926
Children and father cannot live together.

302
00:18:58,126 --> 00:18:59,886
Mother cannot live with the children.

303
00:19:00,086 --> 00:19:03,166
What are 'we'? Where are 'we'?

304
00:19:03,406 --> 00:19:07,446
Such fragmentations. They'll fight over small things

305
00:19:07,686 --> 00:19:12,566
like a pen-knife or something, which pen-knife to be bought.

306
00:19:12,846 --> 00:19:14,846
For that they will fight. How are they 'we'?

307
00:19:15,046 --> 00:19:17,326
There's no unison, there is no concord.

308
00:19:17,566 --> 00:19:21,246
Just the opposite of all that is the Vishuddhi chakra.

309
00:19:21,446 --> 00:19:25,846
So from the very beginning, if you see that a person

310
00:19:26,046 --> 00:19:31,486
who is a realised soul should see everything as a play.

311
00:19:31,726 --> 00:19:34,926
Even the destruction of evil is important,

312
00:19:35,246 --> 00:19:38,326
even the killing of the evil is important.

313
00:19:38,566 --> 00:19:42,006
If you do not kill the evil, the evil will rule.

314
00:19:42,206 --> 00:19:43,606
Do you think Hitler should have been saved

315
00:19:43,806 --> 00:19:47,926
and should have been put in charge of God?

316
00:19:49,086 --> 00:19:51,366
He's saved by killing him.

317
00:19:51,606 --> 00:19:53,366
Because he was destroyed,

318
00:19:53,566 --> 00:19:58,486
because everything was destroyed, he's saved.

319
00:19:58,966 --> 00:20:02,246
This is to be understood in his life, Krishna's life,

320
00:20:02,446 --> 00:20:05,726
that this is first thing happens, so that for you people,

321
00:20:05,926 --> 00:20:08,246
evil is to be finished.

322
00:20:08,526 --> 00:20:09,606
So, what you have to pray

323
00:20:09,806 --> 00:20:12,606
that, "O Lord, finish all the evil of the world,

324
00:20:12,846 --> 00:20:17,326
all the destruction of the world,

325
00:20:17,526 --> 00:20:21,086
all the minds which build up our destruction,

326
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:23,926
please try to neutralise it."

327
00:20:24,126 --> 00:20:26,446
This is what a Sahaja Yogi should ask for.

328
00:20:26,646 --> 00:20:27,446
Instead of that,

329
00:20:27,646 --> 00:20:32,606
they try to sometimes identify themselves with these ideas.

330
00:20:32,846 --> 00:20:34,966
That's not correct . You have to stand up

331
00:20:35,206 --> 00:20:37,126
and you have to say, "That it's wrong",

332
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:40,726
"We are not to destroy anyone, we are not to kill anybody,

333
00:20:40,966 --> 00:20:42,246
we have no right."

334
00:20:42,446 --> 00:20:47,006
So when Krishna told Arjuna that, "You kill everyone

335
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,766
who are related to you, who are your friends

336
00:20:50,006 --> 00:20:55,046
and who look like your gurus, but they're already dead."

337
00:20:55,246 --> 00:20:57,406
It was Shri Krishna who said,

338
00:20:57,686 --> 00:21:01,926
it was the incarnation of Shri Krishna said it.

339
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,446
That doesn't that you start killing everybody,

340
00:21:04,646 --> 00:21:09,726
becoming Arjuna, you're not Arjuna.

341
00:21:10,806 --> 00:21:14,806
That is how Anand Marg, this thing organisation came up,

342
00:21:15,006 --> 00:21:17,046
which started killing everyone,

343
00:21:17,246 --> 00:21:21,286
thinking that they have a right to kill. How?

344
00:21:21,646 --> 00:21:23,246
You have no sense of right and wrong.

345
00:21:23,486 --> 00:21:26,926
How can you kill anyone or how can you save any.

346
00:21:27,126 --> 00:21:29,406
First of all try to save instead of killing.

347
00:21:29,646 --> 00:21:34,126
Supposing you are faced with a boat which is in danger,

348
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:35,646
people are getting drowned

349
00:21:35,846 --> 00:21:38,006
and you find that you have to save the people.

350
00:21:38,246 --> 00:21:42,086
Will you kill the people there or you try to salvage them?

351
00:21:42,286 --> 00:21:44,206
There is no occasion for killing now.

352
00:21:44,406 --> 00:21:47,446
You don't have to worry about killing, let God do that job.

353
00:21:47,646 --> 00:21:50,126
What you have to do is to save people,

354
00:21:50,326 --> 00:21:54,406
you have to save as many as possible all the time.

355
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:59,206
And those who are wrong type of people, you just forget about them.

356
00:21:59,446 --> 00:22:02,646
You just move them out. Take them away.

357
00:22:02,926 --> 00:22:04,046
Have nothing to do with them.

358
00:22:04,246 --> 00:22:07,406
Do what you like, but do not kill them.

359
00:22:07,646 --> 00:22:11,286
So that is one thing one has to understand as Sahaja Yogis,

360
00:22:11,526 --> 00:22:15,126
that you are not here to kill anyone, to destroy anyone,

361
00:22:15,366 --> 00:22:19,046
to trouble anyone or to do something that is not proper.

362
00:22:19,286 --> 00:22:22,606
Even there is no need to say harsh words.

363
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,966
God is going to look after. He's so anxious today,

364
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:30,406
you are on the stage and He's so anxious to help you in every way

365
00:22:30,606 --> 00:22:32,966
because you're doing His work. But doing His work

366
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:33,886
you don't take up

367
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:37,766
His sword into your hands and start killing everyone.

368
00:22:38,006 --> 00:22:40,926
That's a very common thing we do it, in Sahaja Yoga,

369
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:43,246
I've seen people become very aggressive,

370
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:45,086
they talk very aggressively.

371
00:22:45,286 --> 00:22:48,406
Specially the new-comers who come in, in a programme.

372
00:22:48,646 --> 00:22:52,486
Instead of being kind, nice, compassionate, good to them,

373
00:22:52,686 --> 00:22:55,206
immediately they'll say, "You're a bhoot!"

374
00:22:55,446 --> 00:22:58,246
Very common.

375
00:22:59,446 --> 00:23:03,886
You won't find me doing that anytime, do I?

376
00:23:04,326 --> 00:23:06,726
Then you start aggressing each other also,

377
00:23:06,926 --> 00:23:09,766
which is against the principle of Vishuddhi.

378
00:23:09,966 --> 00:23:10,886
You're not to aggress.

379
00:23:11,086 --> 00:23:13,846
You see, because whole thing becomes discretion.

380
00:23:14,046 --> 00:23:17,166
What is discretion is diplomacy.

381
00:23:17,446 --> 00:23:20,566
The divine diplomacy is expressed through your discretion.

382
00:23:20,806 --> 00:23:22,846
If you have a sense of discretion, now you know -

383
00:23:23,046 --> 00:23:24,766
this man is dangerous,

384
00:23:25,006 --> 00:23:26,366
he is troubling you,

385
00:23:26,566 --> 00:23:28,246
now if you have a proper sense,

386
00:23:28,446 --> 00:23:31,886
you will remove that person in such a way from amidst yourself

387
00:23:32,126 --> 00:23:36,926
that there won't be any more discussion or destruction.

388
00:23:37,126 --> 00:23:41,766
But on the contrary, what you do is to challenge that person,

389
00:23:42,006 --> 00:23:44,726
and a big fight starts. And Sahaja Yogis can fight,

390
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:49,286
I tell you sometimes I don't know what to say about their fights.

391
00:23:49,646 --> 00:23:51,646
So must have discretion, must understand.

392
00:23:51,846 --> 00:23:54,846
A situation develops, for example, a situation develops

393
00:23:55,046 --> 00:23:56,926
where you find somebody is telling you,

394
00:23:57,126 --> 00:23:59,846
"You see, this person has said this about you."

395
00:24:00,086 --> 00:24:02,566
Then the same person goes and tells another person,

396
00:24:02,806 --> 00:24:05,286
"That person has said this about you."

397
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:07,206
Then you start quarelling

398
00:24:07,406 --> 00:24:11,566
instead of finding out the basic reason, instead of finding out,

399
00:24:11,726 --> 00:24:14,686
"Why, why this is happening,

400
00:24:14,926 --> 00:24:17,366
why such a situation has come between ourselves.

401
00:24:17,606 --> 00:24:19,166
We were friends, what has happened?"

402
00:24:19,366 --> 00:24:22,286
Instead of that, one starts fighting, getting angry.

403
00:24:22,486 --> 00:24:28,846
That's not the sign of any realised soul expression.

404
00:24:29,086 --> 00:24:33,846
Realised souls expressions have to be extremely discreet,

405
00:24:34,086 --> 00:24:36,126
delicate, beautiful.

406
00:24:36,326 --> 00:24:40,006
Nobody should notice

407
00:24:40,206 --> 00:24:46,286
that you have been in any way effective,

408
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:50,206
and that's how you'll work it out.

409
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:53,246
So, the incarnation of Shri Krishna as we say

410
00:24:53,446 --> 00:24:57,006
is the incarnation of the divine diplomacy.

411
00:24:57,406 --> 00:24:59,886
So, he plays.

412
00:25:00,086 --> 00:25:02,126
Give you an example how he plays.

413
00:25:02,326 --> 00:25:07,686
There was a rakshasa, a devil,

414
00:25:08,086 --> 00:25:13,166
who had a blessing from Shiva

415
00:25:13,406 --> 00:25:19,486
that nobody can kill him.

416
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:26,286
And only a saint who has never opened his eyes all his life,

417
00:25:26,646 --> 00:25:30,046
if he puts his eyes on him, he will be killed.

418
00:25:30,486 --> 00:25:34,966
So, there was a saint who had a blessing

419
00:25:35,286 --> 00:25:38,886
that you go into your yoga, yoga nidra,

420
00:25:39,086 --> 00:25:43,006
sleep in your yoga sleep,

421
00:25:43,206 --> 00:25:46,086
and once you open your eyes

422
00:25:46,286 --> 00:25:51,766
on whomsoever it will fall, such a person will die.

423
00:25:54,006 --> 00:25:57,246
Alright, so Shri Krishna was very clever.

424
00:25:57,526 --> 00:26:00,406
He was fighting this devil

425
00:26:00,606 --> 00:26:04,286
and this devil was about to kill Shri Krishna.

426
00:26:04,486 --> 00:26:08,326
And Shri Krishna knew all about this, his background.

427
00:26:08,726 --> 00:26:11,486
So he started running away from the field,

428
00:26:11,726 --> 00:26:13,726
so he's got a name called Ranchodas,

429
00:26:13,926 --> 00:26:16,486
the one who runs away from the battle field,

430
00:26:16,726 --> 00:26:19,326
is regarded as something really derogatory,

431
00:26:19,526 --> 00:26:23,166
because it's not something great to run away from the battle field.

432
00:26:23,406 --> 00:26:24,286
So, he didn't mind,

433
00:26:24,486 --> 00:26:28,126
he ran away and then this devil started following him

434
00:26:28,326 --> 00:26:29,446
And he went into the cave

435
00:26:29,646 --> 00:26:33,806
where this great saint was sleeping in his yoga nidra.

436
00:26:34,446 --> 00:26:37,406
And he removed his shawl

437
00:26:37,606 --> 00:26:41,726
and put it slowly, delicately, on that saint

438
00:26:42,006 --> 00:26:43,686
and hid himself.

439
00:26:43,926 --> 00:26:45,966
So, this rakshasa came behind him.

440
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:49,846
He saw him lying down there. He thought this was Shri Krishna.

441
00:26:50,086 --> 00:26:53,726
He said, "Ah so now you're tired, you're lying down here.

442
00:26:53,966 --> 00:26:56,006
Come along now, open your eyes!"

443
00:26:56,246 --> 00:27:02,206
And as soon as he pulled the shawl with little strength,

444
00:27:02,446 --> 00:27:05,246
this fellow got up and his eyes looked at him

445
00:27:05,446 --> 00:27:08,486
and he just was burnt.

446
00:27:11,486 --> 00:27:15,286
And he did not mind getting the bad name of Ranchodas.

447
00:27:15,566 --> 00:27:18,886
That is the sign of diplomacy.

448
00:27:19,086 --> 00:27:24,286
So the whole discretion of his is plain throughout his life,

449
00:27:24,486 --> 00:27:27,086
the whole discretion, what he should do,

450
00:27:27,286 --> 00:27:29,006
what is right, what is wrong,

451
00:27:29,246 --> 00:27:32,806
is he doesn't have this problem.

452
00:27:33,086 --> 00:27:37,926
Then he had to have his powers, all of them brought on this earth.

453
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:39,646
So, he played a trick .

454
00:27:39,846 --> 00:27:45,606
He got all those powers in the form of women, young women.

455
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:51,846
And he made one king - you see-

456
00:27:52,806 --> 00:28:00,086
drag these women into his own court for him to use them.

457
00:28:00,286 --> 00:28:02,806
But he could never touch them.

458
00:28:03,006 --> 00:28:05,846
So, Shri Krishna went and defeated this man.

459
00:28:06,046 --> 00:28:07,966
He has to have justification also;

460
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:10,766
he has to have a religious justification for doing something.

461
00:28:11,086 --> 00:28:13,646
So he killed this king, brought all these women

462
00:28:13,886 --> 00:28:19,726
and they all became his wives, so-called.

463
00:28:21,286 --> 00:28:23,406
All kinds of tricks he used to play.

464
00:28:23,606 --> 00:28:26,126
I'll tell you the Radha's trick that he played.

465
00:28:26,326 --> 00:28:29,566
Today I'm wearing a dress like Radha because she's Viratangana,

466
00:28:29,846 --> 00:28:32,766
she's the one who protects our Sushumna Nadi.

467
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:37,046
She's the Mahalakshmi and she wears the sari like this to protect.

468
00:28:37,286 --> 00:28:40,726
She wears this way, while she leaves her left hand open

469
00:28:40,926 --> 00:28:45,086
because this is the Shakti of Mahakali and the right hand she closes

470
00:28:45,286 --> 00:28:49,406
because the right hand is the Shakti of Mahasaraswati,

471
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:52,726
meaning the power of creation,

472
00:28:52,966 --> 00:28:55,046
because creation has been done already.

473
00:28:55,286 --> 00:28:58,246
She's created the earth and she's created human beings,

474
00:28:58,446 --> 00:29:00,286
everything is done . Now that is stopped.

475
00:29:00,486 --> 00:29:02,446
And in India, Brahmadeva is not worshipped

476
00:29:02,646 --> 00:29:05,886
except there's one temple where they worship Brahmadeva,

477
00:29:06,086 --> 00:29:09,086
otherwise Brahmadeva has no temple or anything.

478
00:29:09,326 --> 00:29:12,446
So she closes this side, she preserves it within herself

479
00:29:12,686 --> 00:29:14,406
and she opens her left side.

480
00:29:14,646 --> 00:29:16,486
And in front of her

481
00:29:16,726 --> 00:29:20,726
is the complete protection made for all her disciples.

482
00:29:20,966 --> 00:29:23,606
This is the whole big 'archal' she makes,

483
00:29:23,806 --> 00:29:26,086
normally the 'archal' is other side of it,

484
00:29:26,286 --> 00:29:30,526
where the child is kept inside, hidden in other sari.

485
00:29:30,726 --> 00:29:33,646
But in this one, the one that they have here

486
00:29:33,886 --> 00:29:35,806
is the child is kept underneath this,

487
00:29:36,046 --> 00:29:39,326
so the whole ascent takes place of Mahalakshmi.

488
00:29:39,526 --> 00:29:43,526
And that's why this is the Radha's powers is shown.

489
00:29:43,726 --> 00:29:46,526
So I'll tell you the last story about her

490
00:29:46,726 --> 00:29:53,166
which will conclude this talk about

491
00:29:53,406 --> 00:29:55,126
Radha and Shri Krishna.

492
00:29:55,366 --> 00:29:57,806
That one day,

493
00:29:58,606 --> 00:30:04,246
one of the wives of Shri Krishna was befooled by Narada,

494
00:30:04,486 --> 00:30:06,206
and Narada said, "See,

495
00:30:06,446 --> 00:30:08,926
Krishna doesn't love you, he only loves Radha.

496
00:30:09,126 --> 00:30:11,406
He's just telling you stories that he loves you,

497
00:30:11,606 --> 00:30:16,246
that you are his wives but he is not. He is only attached to Radha."

498
00:30:16,486 --> 00:30:21,166
So, the rumour, you see, went into the women.

499
00:30:21,406 --> 00:30:25,126
All of them started feeling that, "O really, it is so."

500
00:30:25,326 --> 00:30:28,366
So they went and told Shri Krishna that

501
00:30:28,566 --> 00:30:31,486
"You don't love us, you just love Radha."

502
00:30:31,686 --> 00:30:33,366
He said, "Who told you?" They said, "Narada."

503
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:36,646
"No, no, who told you this." They said, "Narada."

504
00:30:36,846 --> 00:30:38,246
He said, "Narada is just telling you lies, you see,

505
00:30:38,446 --> 00:30:42,166
he is just trying to make some quarrel between you and me,

506
00:30:42,366 --> 00:30:44,126
so don't listen to him."

507
00:30:44,326 --> 00:30:46,446
They said, "No, no, it's true, we can prove it."

508
00:30:46,686 --> 00:30:48,246
He said, "Alright. I don't know that,

509
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:50,406
but just now I got terrible pain in the stomach,

510
00:30:50,606 --> 00:30:53,966
terrible pain, I can't get over it." So they got all worried.

511
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:57,726
They said, "What's the matter? what sort of a pain it is,

512
00:30:57,966 --> 00:31:00,926
what can we do to overcome this pain?"

513
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:02,886
He said, "There's very simple thing that

514
00:31:03,086 --> 00:31:07,806
you'll have to give me the dust of your feet to drink.

515
00:31:08,046 --> 00:31:11,566
If you can take out the dust of your feet and give me to drink,

516
00:31:11,806 --> 00:31:13,366
then I'll be saved."

517
00:31:13,566 --> 00:31:17,006
So, these ladies used their brains. They said that

518
00:31:17,206 --> 00:31:18,726
"Already he doesn't love us

519
00:31:18,966 --> 00:31:20,966
and then if we give him the dust of our feet,

520
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:24,926
we'll be committing sins and then it is going to be much worse.

521
00:31:25,126 --> 00:31:28,006
So, what's the use of playing into his hands, he's very diplomatic,

522
00:31:28,206 --> 00:31:29,646
it's better to forget about it."

523
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:32,166
They said, "No, no, no we don't want to do such a sinful thing,

524
00:31:32,366 --> 00:31:35,766
is to give you the dust of our feet, it's non-protocolish,

525
00:31:35,966 --> 00:31:38,966
we have nothing to do like that, you don't teach us all bad things."

526
00:31:39,166 --> 00:31:42,206
So they stopped it. So Narada came, he said, "Now what to do,

527
00:31:42,406 --> 00:31:44,686
how to get rid of your pain in the stomach."

528
00:31:44,926 --> 00:31:47,206
He said, "There's only way out, you go to Radha

529
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,766
and tell her that I've got a pain in the stomach

530
00:31:49,966 --> 00:31:52,606
and this is the medicine." So, he went to Radhaji

531
00:31:52,806 --> 00:31:55,846
and he said to her that,

532
00:31:56,046 --> 00:31:59,126
"You see, Shri Krishna is very sick, he's got pain in the stomach

533
00:31:59,326 --> 00:32:04,326
and what you have to do is to give the dust of your feet."

534
00:32:04,886 --> 00:32:07,366
She said, "Yes, why not, take it,

535
00:32:07,686 --> 00:32:10,406
for that pain, of course, why not?"

536
00:32:11,206 --> 00:32:16,846
So, he said, "Aren't you worried about your punyas,

537
00:32:17,086 --> 00:32:19,046
aren't you worried that you're committing sin."

538
00:32:19,286 --> 00:32:21,366
He said, "You don't know this Shri Krishna,

539
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,366
he has no sense of sin at all.

540
00:32:23,606 --> 00:32:25,646
He makes me do sin morning till evening,

541
00:32:25,886 --> 00:32:27,206
what am I to worry about sins.

542
00:32:27,406 --> 00:32:30,566
I'm not going to worry about that, you better take this for him,

543
00:32:30,766 --> 00:32:31,886
this is his worry."

544
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:34,686
So, he took the dust of Radha's feet

545
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:37,206
and took it down to Shri Krishna.

546
00:32:37,446 --> 00:32:40,246
Shri Krishna: "Did she give you." He said, "Did she give you?"

547
00:32:40,446 --> 00:32:42,606
He said, "Yes, she has, I'm surprised,

548
00:32:42,846 --> 00:32:46,126
but she's not worried about her sins, she's not worried."

549
00:32:46,366 --> 00:32:49,206
He said, "That I know." So, he said, "But how do you explain it?"

550
00:32:49,406 --> 00:32:51,126
He said, "You'll understand just now."

551
00:32:51,406 --> 00:32:53,686
He took the dust of Radha's feet,

552
00:32:53,926 --> 00:32:58,926
you see Radha's feet were dusted

553
00:32:59,126 --> 00:33:01,126
or were full of dust of Vrindavan,

554
00:33:01,326 --> 00:33:07,566
and Vrindavan has got yellow kind of clay,

555
00:33:07,766 --> 00:33:10,246
you see, the soil is yellowish

556
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:14,606
and the whole yellow thing was on her feet

557
00:33:14,806 --> 00:33:17,086
which she removed and took it.

558
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:22,326
So when Shri Krishna drank that dust,

559
00:33:22,806 --> 00:33:26,366
Narada saw in the heart of Shri Krishna,

560
00:33:26,566 --> 00:33:31,326
Radha was lying down and playing with her feet

561
00:33:31,566 --> 00:33:33,606
on the lotus of his heart.

562
00:33:33,806 --> 00:33:39,806
The lotus had the pollen,

563
00:33:40,286 --> 00:33:42,326
the pollen of the lotus was touching her feet

564
00:33:42,526 --> 00:33:44,206
and was making it yellow.

565
00:33:44,526 --> 00:33:47,926
That's what she said that "What is it when I'm in his heart,

566
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:54,126
my feet are in his heart, so what is the sin I can commit?"

567
00:33:56,246 --> 00:34:00,766
And when the ladies heard this, they realised that

568
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:03,966
their idea about Shri Krishna is still not sufficient.

569
00:34:04,206 --> 00:34:07,526
They have to be Radha to understand him.

570
00:34:07,766 --> 00:34:10,006
And this is how he plays diplomacy,

571
00:34:10,246 --> 00:34:12,966
simple tricks here and there by which he did it.

572
00:34:13,206 --> 00:34:18,846
And to introduce the beauty of Leela, he started Ras;

573
00:34:19,046 --> 00:34:22,246
Ra is energy, Sa means 'with'.

574
00:34:22,526 --> 00:34:25,646
So, he made Radha dance, stand there with him,

575
00:34:25,886 --> 00:34:28,446
give him the the power and everybody danced.

576
00:34:28,686 --> 00:34:32,246
And they looked like as if Radha and Krishna dancing.

577
00:34:32,526 --> 00:34:35,966
And this is what he started, and then to make it, culminate it,

578
00:34:36,166 --> 00:34:40,206
he made a festival of Holi in which he said, "Abandon everything!

579
00:34:40,446 --> 00:34:42,286
For a minute you abandon everything."

580
00:34:42,526 --> 00:34:45,366
And that abandonment has now become a,

581
00:34:45,606 --> 00:34:47,486
that's for only one day you have to abandon,

582
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:51,486
here it has become a year-long Holi.

583
00:34:51,726 --> 00:34:53,566
So, people are busy with a year-long Holi

584
00:34:53,766 --> 00:34:55,446
without Shri Krishna and Radha.

585
00:34:55,686 --> 00:34:58,926
So, what will be the situation of such a place?

586
00:34:59,126 --> 00:35:01,726
And that's why I think, what happens that

587
00:35:01,926 --> 00:35:05,806
when you try to attract others by all these stupid things,

588
00:35:06,046 --> 00:35:09,046
only the bhoots are attracted and they get into you.

589
00:35:09,286 --> 00:35:12,286
And once they get into you, you get funny,

590
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:14,006
you don't know why you behave like this,

591
00:35:14,206 --> 00:35:16,566
why things work out that way.

592
00:35:16,846 --> 00:35:18,726
This is why we have to understand

593
00:35:18,926 --> 00:35:21,566
that we have to be attractive to God.

594
00:35:21,806 --> 00:35:26,126
And you'll be only attractive to God if you have got your spirit.

595
00:35:26,406 --> 00:35:30,126
If the spirit is shining, then only you can get into it.

596
00:35:30,606 --> 00:35:33,286
So May God Bless You.
