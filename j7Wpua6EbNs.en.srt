1
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:26,616
Today, we are going to worship
the Mahalakshmi

2
00:05:26,817 --> 00:05:32,675
which I think is very much worshipped
in this country

3
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:36,715
where they worship Her as Maria

4
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:42,903
and also there’s a swayambhu of Maria,
you must have seen.

5
00:05:43,104 --> 00:05:49,522
And also there was an apparition of Her.
First I never believed that it could be,

6
00:05:49,723 --> 00:05:55,935
but then after feeling the vibrations,
now I know it was true,

7
00:05:56,136 --> 00:05:59,691
that She did appear here in an apparition.

8
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:05,517
She appeared before Me, also, you must
have seen, in a photograph.

9
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:19,364
This is the principle by which you have
risen to this state.

10
00:06:19,565 --> 00:06:25,952
The central path of your ascent is created
by Mahalakshmi power

11
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:29,920
for the Kundalini to rise.

12
00:06:30,121 --> 00:06:33,593
In the temple of Mahalakshmi in Kolhapur

13
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:37,556
they always sing the song of “Ude, Ude,
Ambe.”

14
00:06:37,757 --> 00:06:46,295
So I asked the people there, “Why do you
sing Ambe’s song in Mahalakshmi’s temple?”

15
00:06:46,496 --> 00:06:53,456
So they said that, “We don’t know why
we do it, but is it wrong?”

16
00:06:53,657 --> 00:07:01,752
I said, “No, because only in the
Mahalakshmi channel

17
00:07:01,953 --> 00:07:07,632
Kundalini can rise and Kundalini is
the Amba.”

18
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:11,973
That’s how, you see, they understood
and they were really amazed

19
00:07:12,174 --> 00:07:16,059
that I explained it very well ‘cause
from ancient times

20
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:23,358
this song has been sung there and they
never knew why this song is sung.

21
00:07:25,267 --> 00:07:33,513
Coming to the point of Mahalakshmi, we have
to understand what does it do,

22
00:07:33,714 --> 00:07:41,687
what it’s help is that this Mahalakshmi
channel or the Mahalakshmi’s powers

23
00:07:41,888 --> 00:07:54,057
have created within us a proper balance,
a proper route for Kundalini to rise.

24
00:07:54,258 --> 00:07:59,880
Left and right has been balanced and She
is the one who creates

25
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:09,338
and makes a wider path for Kundalini
to rise.

26
00:08:09,544 --> 00:08:16,941
This is the path of compassion and love.

27
00:08:17,142 --> 00:08:21,600
Through that compassion and love
She creates this path

28
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:29,665
because She knows that if the path is not
wide enough the Kundalini cannot rise.

29
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:36,300
Ultimately, one reaches a state where you
start seeking

30
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:41,924
and when you start seeking, your
Mahalakshmi principle has been awakened.

31
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:46,767
That is awakened and sometimes it is
very strong.

32
00:08:46,968 --> 00:08:50,274
Then you start seeking in a mad way.

33
00:08:50,475 --> 00:08:54,475
I am sorry to say that many are already
lost in seeking,

34
00:08:54,676 --> 00:09:03,765
but there are so many who have now come
to the right path and to the right ascent.

35
00:09:03,966 --> 00:09:08,615
The another thing this Mahalakshmi
principle does is to allow

36
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:14,345
the Kundalini’s power to go to different
chakras also,

37
00:09:14,546 --> 00:09:19,433
to make a way to different chakras and
corrects all the chakras.

38
00:09:19,634 --> 00:09:23,329
She is a very flexible force, I should say,

39
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:27,812
which guides the Kundalini into different
chakras

40
00:09:28,013 --> 00:09:33,082
and She understands which chakra needs
the help of the Kundalini.

41
00:09:33,283 --> 00:09:38,008
So you must have seen that when
the Kundalini rises how She pulsates,

42
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:45,286
where She goes, where She shows the need
is of your awakening.

43
00:09:45,674 --> 00:09:52,796
All this works out because She is full
of compassion

44
00:09:52,997 --> 00:09:59,574
and love that you should get your absolute
truth.

45
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:03,265
We have many problems as it is, you know,

46
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:06,624
in Sahaja Yoga because when people
are ascending

47
00:10:06,825 --> 00:10:14,817
they carry on with them some of their
past stones and they cannot climb.

48
00:10:15,018 --> 00:10:20,845
They try then they fall, they try then they
fall, then they go up again, they fall.

49
00:10:21,046 --> 00:10:29,285
But today I’m going to tell you about what
is the state one has to achieve.

50
00:10:30,476 --> 00:10:35,168
As Shri Krishna has said it in the “Gita,”

51
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:38,881
describes Stitha Pragya, the second
chapter,

52
00:10:39,082 --> 00:10:43,427
but it’s very difficult to understand Him,
He is not so clear cut as your Mother is.

53
00:10:43,628 --> 00:10:48,721
So people don’t understand what He is
saying. (Aside: “Can you close the...?”)

54
00:10:54,989 --> 00:11:00,854
And they ask the question, “How, how do you
reach that state of Stitha Pragya?

55
00:11:01,055 --> 00:11:05,047
How do you get to that stage?”

56
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:08,158
But Gyaneshwara, when he wrote
his “Gyaneshwari,”

57
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:15,731
he called it as the Sahaja Stithi, means
the state of Sahaj.

58
00:11:16,723 --> 00:11:22,748
He didn’t call Stitha Pragya. He called it
as Sahaja Stithi,

59
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:29,417
meaning the state of Sahaj.

60
00:11:29,618 --> 00:11:35,415
So he describes the Sahaj in a very
beautiful manner and very subtle.

61
00:11:35,615 --> 00:11:40,639
Of course, Gyaneshwara also, very few
people understand, I think.

62
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:49,665
A person who reaches that state is like
a mirror

63
00:11:49,951 --> 00:11:56,711
and so many faces pass over that mirror,
so many look into that mirror,

64
00:11:56,912 --> 00:12:06,235
so many decorate in front of the mirror,
but mirror is the same as it is.

65
00:12:06,436 --> 00:12:12,051
So the person who is a Stitha Pragya
or the person who is Sahaja

66
00:12:12,252 --> 00:12:21,196
is not bothered about what is facing him,
who is facing whom, where he is.

67
00:12:21,397 --> 00:12:28,346
He stays within himself. He contains
within himself.

68
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:37,206
Like the sun. If the sun plays with
his different rays,

69
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:42,007
he is not lost. All the rays again return
to him.

70
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:52,330
In the same way, all the senses that we
have, all the senses

71
00:12:52,531 --> 00:13:00,451
that are there do play around, but for
a person who is in a Sahaja state

72
00:13:00,652 --> 00:13:05,203
it doesn’t matter, it makes no difference.
He’s not involved. He just plays around.

73
00:13:05,404 --> 00:13:12,346
Again, all of them come back to him.
This is a state you all have to achieve.

74
00:13:12,547 --> 00:13:16,930
Then you are really Sahaja Yogis.
But I still find people lost,

75
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:22,853
getting money out of Sahaja Yoga, some
people lost getting out of leaderships,

76
00:13:23,054 --> 00:13:28,708
some are lost in getting jealousies
and envies and all that.

77
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:33,828
So that means a lot of work has to be done,
still, within.

78
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:39,468
There is no need to work as such if you
leave everything.

79
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:43,171
That’s why I always say meditate, because
when you meditate,

80
00:13:43,372 --> 00:13:51,266
what happens, that all these things that
are pulling you down are finished.

81
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:56,440
Gradually they disappear because you
become your Self.

82
00:13:56,641 --> 00:14:00,665
You get contained by yourself and you are
never bored.

83
00:14:00,865 --> 00:14:04,091
I am never bored. I don’t know what
boring word means, you see.

84
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:09,732
When it is with you or alone, I never get
bored. What is there to get bored?

85
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:14,522
If you are not involved into anything
you never get bored.

86
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:19,957
Another thing is you rise above all these
things, like greed.

87
00:14:20,158 --> 00:14:24,192
Now people who are greedy are still
involved making money here,

88
00:14:24,393 --> 00:14:29,118
making money there, all that thing.
Those people who are still full of lust

89
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:34,782
are still making, organizing, some things
like that.

90
00:14:34,983 --> 00:14:40,931
But in a Sahaj Stithi you just watch.
You are just a witness.

91
00:14:41,132 --> 00:14:47,423
You are not lost into anything that is
pulling you down.

92
00:14:47,624 --> 00:14:51,857
This state is not difficult to achieve
for you, at all,

93
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,914
because you have crossed over your mind.

94
00:14:55,115 --> 00:14:58,990
Now all these things come to you through
your mind.

95
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:04,599
I’ve already said that mind is a myth,
which you must accept.

96
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,774
Myth is that this mind gives you ideas.

97
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:12,488
Some people think, “Yes Mother, but -
yes Mother, but - .”

98
00:15:12,689 --> 00:15:17,987
This “but” is coming from your brain,
from your mind.

99
00:15:18,188 --> 00:15:23,779
The brain is reality, but not the mind.
The mind says “but”

100
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:28,306
and then you start feeling very depressed
sometimes, unhappy,

101
00:15:28,507 --> 00:15:32,373
because some people feel even bad because
they are very good people,

102
00:15:32,574 --> 00:15:37,168
that there are so few Sahaja Yogis.
Doesn’t matter.

103
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:45,142
Just watch and this watching state, this
witness state is the Sahaja Stithi.

104
00:15:45,343 --> 00:15:49,623
In that you become so subtle, you become
your Self,

105
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:56,050
meaning so subtle that nothing can disturb
you, nothing can change you.

106
00:15:56,251 --> 00:16:02,986
Now see the nature as it is. You know
there are ninety-two elements

107
00:16:03,187 --> 00:16:06,618
and ninety-two elements, none of them
can be...

108
00:16:06,819 --> 00:16:16,150
say for example, you cannot make silver
into gold. Gold into silver.

109
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:21,999
The atoms are so arranged that they have
certain valencies

110
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,326
and apart from atom, even molecules
are so arranged

111
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:30,792
that they have their own structure.
You cannot change.

112
00:16:30,993 --> 00:16:33,608
If you try to change then you will create
bombs,

113
00:16:33,816 --> 00:16:38,437
atomic bomb, this bomb. It’s absolutely
destructive.

114
00:16:38,638 --> 00:16:42,666
It’s only human beings who can change,
who can transform.

115
00:16:42,867 --> 00:16:48,932
Now look at the blessings that you are
a human being and you can be transformed

116
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:55,526
and you can be made into a new element
that is the Self.

117
00:16:55,727 --> 00:16:58,385
This is the specialty of human beings.

118
00:16:58,586 --> 00:17:01,366
But if somebody there is a false guru
or somebody,

119
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:04,575
he tries to do something, you’ll explode.

120
00:17:04,776 --> 00:17:09,312
I have seen people who have been to false
gurus, they still faint,

121
00:17:09,513 --> 00:17:13,382
they still have problems, they still get
troubled

122
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:18,628
more than people who have been without
them.

123
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,697
They are also all right now, much of them
are improved;

124
00:17:21,898 --> 00:17:28,390
but this is one thing one should
understand, that in one way

125
00:17:28,591 --> 00:17:32,778
when you are analyzing and when you are
breaking an atom

126
00:17:32,979 --> 00:17:38,113
or you are breaking a molecule and trying
to transform,

127
00:17:38,314 --> 00:17:43,277
it explodes. It doesn’t work out.

128
00:17:43,478 --> 00:17:48,470
The other way round is that when you
try to synthesize,

129
00:17:48,671 --> 00:17:51,689
then you can form anything in the nature.

130
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:55,681
Like, this has now been brought out
by synthesizing,

131
00:17:55,882 --> 00:18:00,015
this plastic is created by synthesizing.

132
00:18:00,216 --> 00:18:05,171
Matter can be synthesized and can be
brought together

133
00:18:05,372 --> 00:18:11,202
and human beings have to get synthesized
also.

134
00:18:11,403 --> 00:18:20,162
They can be synthesized better than matter
because they change, they transform.

135
00:18:20,363 --> 00:18:29,329
Now say example, there is gold. You make
gold into ornaments, make into anything.

136
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:37,721
It remains all the time, all the time gold.
Gold is gold. It is there.

137
00:18:37,922 --> 00:18:42,230
It is not that by changing them into
ornaments it changes.

138
00:18:42,431 --> 00:18:45,022
Its element is there. Gold is there.

139
00:18:45,223 --> 00:18:49,831
But for human beings they get transformed
when they are synthesized.

140
00:18:50,032 --> 00:18:59,329
This is a very big difference between the
matter and the nature and human beings.

141
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:05,795
Matter, nature are different absolutely
from human beings.

142
00:19:05,996 --> 00:19:13,255
Human beings, once they are transformed,
it’s like a living process.

143
00:19:13,456 --> 00:19:20,366
They become like flowers but still it is
not that you see in the nature.

144
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:26,868
It’s not the same as you see in the nature
because nature doesn’t have a mind.

145
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:33,822
It doesn’t have a mind. It just is under
the control

146
00:19:34,023 --> 00:19:38,605
of the Divine or nature that it’s working
out that way.

147
00:19:38,806 --> 00:19:43,962
But here you are under your own control.

148
00:19:45,073 --> 00:19:48,924
Here you can control yourself.

149
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:54,503
In this synthesis which is growing inside
you what you find,

150
00:19:54,704 --> 00:19:59,006
that you are completely in control
of yourself.

151
00:19:59,207 --> 00:20:02,183
You know what is happening to you.

152
00:20:02,384 --> 00:20:07,525
Now you start seeing yourself separating
from all these things.

153
00:20:07,726 --> 00:20:13,320
Some people come and tell Me, “Mother, see,
my ego is very bad, you just take it out.”

154
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,866
He sees his ego, he sees what is
the problem is.

155
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:22,288
Somebody says, “Mother, my Nabhi is
very bad,I’m still busy with the money.”

156
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:29,105
He sees it. First starts the knowledge
about yourself,

157
00:20:29,306 --> 00:20:36,194
we call as self-knowledge. But one has
to even go beyond self-knowledge.

158
00:20:36,395 --> 00:20:40,635
By that knowledge, what do you do,
we have to see.

159
00:20:43,023 --> 00:20:48,764
When you have the knowledge, first we say
there’s no knowledge,

160
00:20:48,965 --> 00:20:52,213
people have no knowledge, they are
ignorant, there’s darkness, all that.

161
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:58,770
Now the light has come, you can see.
You can know what’s wrong with you.

162
00:20:58,971 --> 00:21:05,416
Now you start separating yourself from all
those things that you see as wrong with you.

163
00:21:05,617 --> 00:21:11,006
You see them getting out. So many
nonsensical things there are.

164
00:21:11,207 --> 00:21:15,904
Like, we have jealousies, envy, greed
and lust.

165
00:21:16,105 --> 00:21:20,257
I mean, it’s horrible things to say
on a Diwali function, see.

166
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:27,267
So the Diwali is that one by one so many
lights are enlightened

167
00:21:27,467 --> 00:21:30,304
and you start seeing it first.

168
00:21:30,505 --> 00:21:34,315
First you start seeing what is wrong
within you,

169
00:21:34,517 --> 00:21:38,074
and then as you see it, you don’t want it.

170
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:45,698
Then you work out to get rid of it,
to become clean.

171
00:21:45,899 --> 00:21:50,512
Now this also knowledge disappears.

172
00:21:50,713 --> 00:21:57,457
You don’t have to have any knowledge.
You are there. You are there.

173
00:21:57,658 --> 00:22:02,486
There is no need to know about your
chakras, you are just there.

174
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:06,638
At that stage nothing matters.

175
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:11,282
You become just like a stone, I can say.

176
00:22:11,483 --> 00:22:18,027
Stone with a brain intact and a heart
intact and a liver intact.

177
00:22:18,228 --> 00:22:23,206
You just don’t mind anything, don’t get
upset with anything.

178
00:22:23,407 --> 00:22:32,050
You just enjoy the love and compassion
that’s flowing.

179
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:37,006
And the ripples that come back to you,
even that is lost after some time

180
00:22:37,207 --> 00:22:41,356
and you are just nothing but Sahaj.

181
00:22:42,205 --> 00:22:47,350
That is the state people achieved. In those
days they achieved this state.

182
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:50,658
But with that, what lacking happened,
that they’d get lost.

183
00:22:50,859 --> 00:22:54,600
They all got lost. They couldn’t do
anything to others.

184
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:00,307
One person getting it, becoming great,
finished. Or two persons at the most.

185
00:23:00,508 --> 00:23:04,287
So now Sahaja Yoga stands, first of all,

186
00:23:04,488 --> 00:23:08,686
at the knowledge state, where you have
the knowledge.

187
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:13,568
First, you should first of all have full
knowledge about yourself.

188
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:17,090
The self-knowledge should be complete.

189
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:21,635
Then in the third stage we should say
that when the knowledge is full

190
00:23:21,836 --> 00:23:26,891
you should get rid of all those things
that you know about yourself,

191
00:23:27,092 --> 00:23:31,562
which are useless, which are hampering
your progress, which you know is wrong.

192
00:23:31,763 --> 00:23:37,310
Like, I see some dirt falling on my sari,
I’ll just clean it out like that.

193
00:23:37,511 --> 00:23:43,072
Then you start separating yourself
into that Sahaja state.

194
00:23:43,273 --> 00:23:49,258
But still in Sahaja Yoga you develop
another dimension

195
00:23:49,496 --> 00:23:56,379
which is collective consciousness. That is
the modern Sahaja Yoga.

196
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:02,313
In the olden days they didn’t have this,
so they just all got lost.

197
00:24:02,514 --> 00:24:07,744
Now you have collective consciousness
and in that collective consciousness

198
00:24:07,945 --> 00:24:13,222
you start feeling others, feeling
for others, compassion for others

199
00:24:13,423 --> 00:24:19,871
and you start working out for others.
In that also, sometimes, you know,

200
00:24:20,072 --> 00:24:23,151
when you are working around, you think,
"How much money I can make?

201
00:24:23,352 --> 00:24:29,953
What I can achieve as a leader?" -
or some sort of thing is still there.

202
00:24:30,154 --> 00:24:33,981
But this collective consciousness starts
growing.

203
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:37,450
When it starts growing, then you become
as I said,

204
00:24:37,651 --> 00:24:42,723
drop in the ocean, means complete ocean,
you become.

205
00:24:43,869 --> 00:24:51,151
You become complete ocean. So the ocean
has its own mariadas. It doesn’t bother.

206
00:24:51,352 --> 00:24:54,849
It has to live with its mariadas, it lives
with its mariadas.

207
00:24:55,049 --> 00:24:57,796
It doesn’t want to cross any boundaries,
all right.

208
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:01,789
Accept it. It will not cross its
boundaries.

209
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:06,663
In the same way it happens that you are
very self-contained.

210
00:25:06,864 --> 00:25:11,946
You are not selfish, but you become
very self-contained.

211
00:25:12,147 --> 00:25:15,891
You are contained within yourself.

212
00:25:16,092 --> 00:25:20,699
I know many Sahaja Yogis are angry that
I have not punished many horrible people

213
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,972
who have been troubling Sahaja Yoga.
I don’t have to bother.

214
00:25:25,173 --> 00:25:28,177
There’s Paramchaitanya which is doing
a lot of work.

215
00:25:28,378 --> 00:25:32,971
Let it look after it. Why should I bother
about anyone?

216
00:25:33,172 --> 00:25:38,319
You see, after all, things are working out
so why to interfere?

217
00:25:39,216 --> 00:25:47,996
My job is just to watch, just to see.
That’s sufficient.

218
00:25:48,197 --> 00:25:54,639
There’s no need for Me to kill anybody
in this lifetime or to destroy.

219
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,072
They are destroyed by themselves.
I have told you that

220
00:25:59,273 --> 00:26:03,641
I need not expose people, but whichever
country I go,

221
00:26:03,842 --> 00:26:07,501
I find people get exposed. I run away
from there, really, sometimes,

222
00:26:07,702 --> 00:26:11,402
thinking, "God knows what more is going
to come."

223
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:17,382
Even little attention on any country,
it just works out.

224
00:26:17,583 --> 00:26:23,090
Even without My knowledge, “Oh My God,”
I said, “When did I do that?”

225
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:31,894
So one has to become, of course, he becomes
the power of Divine love, no doubt.

226
00:26:32,095 --> 00:26:37,599
He becomes the power of Divine love,
but he doesn’t handle it.

227
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,731
Left to this Divine power which is working,

228
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:46,862
which is also separated from Me, you’ll be
surprised. I am alone.

229
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:52,236
Absolutely alone. Even this power is
separated from Me,

230
00:26:52,437 --> 00:26:56,334
but this power knows what is good for
human beings,

231
00:26:56,535 --> 00:27:00,372
what is good for Sahaja Yoga. It works
on its own.

232
00:27:00,573 --> 00:27:05,332
I don’t interfere. It’s a reflex action,
believe Me, it’s a reflex action.

233
00:27:05,533 --> 00:27:09,979
Maybe you might say, “Mother, you have
made it.” All right, whatever it is,

234
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:15,558
but I don’t interfere with it. I don’t have
to tell anything to it.

235
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,786
It just works and it’s working so well.

236
00:27:18,987 --> 00:27:22,552
I’ll give you an example. Once in England
long time back,

237
00:27:22,753 --> 00:27:24,682
they said, “Mother, we want to have
a very long summer.”

238
00:27:24,883 --> 00:27:26,779
I said, “Why do you want to ask such
things?”

239
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,951
 “No, no, Mother, we must have a long
summer, a very long summer, very - “

240
00:27:31,152 --> 00:27:38,661
Three or four times they said it and it was
a very long, horrible summer in London.

241
00:27:38,862 --> 00:27:42,583
And it’s not like India where we have
air conditioning, fans,

242
00:27:42,784 --> 00:27:47,078
something we have, at least hand fans.
There was nothing there.

243
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,845
So we didn’t know. We had a little gallery,
we used to sleep in that.

244
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:59,092
So we went to the shop in England and
we asked in London City, for a fan.

245
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:03,141
So they said, “All right, after three
months. You order us.”

246
00:28:03,342 --> 00:28:07,466
After three months when it will be very
cold they will give us the fan.

247
00:28:07,667 --> 00:28:12,884
We said, “We don’t want any fans.”
So My daughter sent two fans by plane.

248
00:28:13,085 --> 00:28:16,282
And that’s how we managed. You see,
Indians, we feel very hot

249
00:28:16,483 --> 00:28:19,167
because we have had a lot of sun
in our country,

250
00:28:19,368 --> 00:28:22,684
we feel much hotter than any one of you.
The way you sit in the sun,

251
00:28:22,885 --> 00:28:26,728
you know, we can’t understand.
You know, in India they used to say,

252
00:28:26,929 --> 00:28:31,464
"An Englishman and a mad dog can only
go in the sun."

253
00:28:31,665 --> 00:28:34,971
So our situation is like that,

254
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:38,086
that we cannot go in the sun because we
have had too much.

255
00:28:38,324 --> 00:28:43,307
And this summer, you see, was so
tremendous, so tremendous

256
00:28:43,508 --> 00:28:50,230
that after that one thing good happened.
That ochre color appeared on the leaves

257
00:28:50,431 --> 00:28:54,535
and then gradually the red and all that
of the autumn season

258
00:28:54,736 --> 00:28:59,135
was best at that time and then one Sahaja
Yogi dreamt that,

259
00:28:59,336 --> 00:29:03,040
“Mother asked me to drive in Her
back yard.”

260
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:09,600
So he told everybody that, “Mother has been
asking me to drive in the back yard.”

261
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,234
So I telephoned to him, I didn’t know
he had dreamt like that,

262
00:29:13,472 --> 00:29:17,866
that, “Can you come along for a while,
I want to go and see this autumn

263
00:29:18,067 --> 00:29:23,013
all over England.” So he came and we were
driving, miles together

264
00:29:23,214 --> 00:29:27,906
and then they told Me, “Mother, it was so,
he told us that that was My back yard.”

265
00:29:28,107 --> 00:29:32,317
Can you imagine that he was driving
for miles together, beautiful,

266
00:29:32,531 --> 00:29:38,472
just like Canada, the whole England
was filled with the beauty of autumn.

267
00:29:38,673 --> 00:29:43,891
So even if there’s something like that
happens, it is compensated.

268
00:29:44,053 --> 00:29:49,731
It is compensated and so beautiful it was,
all the people were out in the autumn

269
00:29:49,932 --> 00:29:54,734
to see the beautiful colors of the nature,
of different greenery,

270
00:29:54,935 --> 00:29:59,264
yellow, ochre, all kinds of colors were
there.

271
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:03,037
Surprisingly, in that country you never
see all that.

272
00:30:03,238 --> 00:30:08,837
And because of the sun shining so bright,
it was compensated.

273
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:16,606
It was compensated by this Paramchaitanya.
So the Paramchaitanya is looking after this.

274
00:30:16,807 --> 00:30:23,419
All these things are managed by
Paramchaitanya. I am doing nothing.

275
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:27,190
I am Nishkriya. I’m just sitting down
and watching.

276
00:30:27,391 --> 00:30:32,142
To Me nothing matters. You see,
it’s working out slowly and steadily.

277
00:30:32,343 --> 00:30:34,971
Ha, if you tell Me something supposing,
they said,

278
00:30:35,172 --> 00:30:37,932
“Mother, we prayed to You and it happened.”
All right, maybe,

279
00:30:38,133 --> 00:30:43,225
these people must have heard, around Me.
Not me, you see,

280
00:30:43,426 --> 00:30:49,875
and they must have done the job and for
that I’m not responsible, in no way.

281
00:30:50,076 --> 00:30:55,275
Like one lady in Mexico had a son, was
very sick and was about to die.

282
00:30:55,476 --> 00:30:58,557
She wrote a letter to Me, three letters
she wrote

283
00:30:58,758 --> 00:31:03,568
that, “My son is going to die, he’s a young
fellow, studying in Harvard.”

284
00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:06,550
I didn’t do anything. I never wrote to her.

285
00:31:06,751 --> 00:31:10,180
Fourth letter came that he’s completely
cured. Now I didn’t do that

286
00:31:10,381 --> 00:31:14,592
because I was just sitting in one place
and how is it, it has worked out?

287
00:31:14,793 --> 00:31:19,786
So everything, you see, you think I do
is not done by Me.

288
00:31:19,987 --> 00:31:24,931
Is done by this Paramchaitanya. Because
I’m also separated from you, completely,

289
00:31:25,132 --> 00:31:29,563
absolutely separated. So they say,
“You pray, now.” You can pray.

290
00:31:29,764 --> 00:31:32,647
If you pray, you pray to these deities
that are around,

291
00:31:32,848 --> 00:31:36,572
you pray to all these ganas and all that,
not to Me.

292
00:31:36,773 --> 00:31:39,349
Because I have nothing to do with it.

293
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:43,016
You see, they don’t tell Me that I have
to do this or I have to do that.

294
00:31:43,217 --> 00:31:46,941
So why should I tell them do this
or do that? It is like that.

295
00:31:47,142 --> 00:31:51,318
And in that state only we can say you are
in a Sahaja state,

296
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,592
where you don’t desire anything, you don’t
want anything.

297
00:31:54,793 --> 00:31:59,695
I do everything. All kinds of things,
I am doing. Like the sun is doing,

298
00:31:59,896 --> 00:32:07,725
I am also doing in the sense that I’m
looking after things, flowers, this that.

299
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:13,012
I am also receiving presents from you,
I’m receiving this from you

300
00:32:13,213 --> 00:32:17,321
and then see, I don’t receive anything.

301
00:32:17,522 --> 00:32:21,635
I don’t have anything. I have no
interest in it.

302
00:32:21,836 --> 00:32:24,489
But you want to give for your joy,
all right, have it.

303
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:27,189
You want to put flowers, all right, you can
have flowers.

304
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:32,683
Even if there’s flowers or not makes no
difference to Me as a person, I’m saying.

305
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:38,960
But as Your Mother I love you.
All of you I love.

306
00:32:39,214 --> 00:32:42,206
But I don’t do anything as such to love
you. And everybody says,

307
00:32:42,407 --> 00:32:47,140
“Mother, You love us so much.” When? When
did I love you? I never even kissed you.

308
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:51,124
But you always say I love you very much.
So what is this?

309
00:32:51,325 --> 00:32:56,987
Who is working it out, this? Is something
which is not Me, beyond Me.

310
00:32:57,188 --> 00:33:01,822
This is the state in which, once we rise,
we call it as Sahaja Stithi.

311
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:07,375
In the Sahaja Stithi you think you are
doing nothing. Everything is working out.

312
00:33:07,576 --> 00:33:11,501
But at this stage if I tell you, you say,
“Oh, we are not doing anything.

313
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:15,455
Why should we spread Sahaja Yoga?
It’s not our job.”

314
00:33:15,656 --> 00:33:20,177
Just now, that’s not your stithi,
that’s why.

315
00:33:20,378 --> 00:33:23,367
So you have to rise up to that state.

316
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:29,268
That’s only possible when you are
in the knowledge state,

317
00:33:29,469 --> 00:33:32,609
where you have self-knowledge, the knowledge
of the whole world.

318
00:33:32,836 --> 00:33:36,398
But if you go beyond knowledge then you
must have seen many a times,

319
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:42,076
I just say something. I just say something
and it is there.

320
00:33:42,277 --> 00:33:45,425
I never feel vibrations of anyone
or anything.

321
00:33:45,626 --> 00:33:48,931
I don’t feel My Kundalini, either nor
any chakras, nothing,

322
00:33:49,132 --> 00:33:52,633
but I know, know automatically like
a computer.

323
00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:58,063
But that computer also I am not. Just it’s
trouble, it’s difficult to explain to you

324
00:33:58,264 --> 00:34:01,700
what is this stithi is because you have
to achieve it.

325
00:34:01,901 --> 00:34:06,386
Once you achieve it then you are
in a very subtle state

326
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:15,432
and that subtle state is nothing but bliss.
But that bliss also you cannot enjoy.

327
00:34:15,662 --> 00:34:23,073
I don’t know how to enjoy everything.
Supposing now you say, “Jai Mataji.”

328
00:34:23,274 --> 00:34:29,215
I forget even you are calling Me.
I also say, “Jai Mataji,” finished.

329
00:34:29,416 --> 00:34:34,058
See it is such a simple thing one has
to understand

330
00:34:34,258 --> 00:34:37,728
that the state in which one has to rise

331
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:42,049
is a state where without doing anything,
everything works out.

332
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:45,546
If that is your state, all right. But it’s
not so.

333
00:34:45,747 --> 00:34:50,523
So you have to rise up to that state
by doing. First you have to do it.

334
00:34:50,724 --> 00:34:57,397
First you have to know and then knowledge
has no need, you don’t have to know,

335
00:34:57,598 --> 00:35:01,925
but first that has to be worked out
and brought to that level.

336
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:07,019
Now Diwali has the significance that
on Diwali day, what we do,

337
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:15,137
we put lights all over. So that we put
Sahaja Yoga everywhere.

338
00:35:15,338 --> 00:35:19,946
But does the light know about itself?

339
00:35:23,136 --> 00:35:31,712
Does the candle knows about itself? She
enlightens everything but she doesn’t know.

340
00:35:34,506 --> 00:35:41,370
Like the moon, which is giving moonlight,
does it know itself?

341
00:35:41,571 --> 00:35:46,242
Does he enjoy? Nothing.

342
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:51,700
In the same way it happens that
on a Diwali day you are,

343
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:55,505
what you are doing is enlightening people,
you are enlightening them,

344
00:35:55,706 --> 00:36:00,828
you are doing all this for them,
it’s a good idea. You must do it.

345
00:36:01,029 --> 00:36:07,447
But also know that you have to become the
lamp yourself which doesn’t know yourself.

346
00:36:08,701 --> 00:36:14,063
So there are two messages. The first one is
that we have to enlighten the world,

347
00:36:14,264 --> 00:36:17,130
we have to enlighten others. This is
the first one.

348
00:36:17,331 --> 00:36:25,243
Then we have to become that which is the
light itself and light itself doesn’t know.

349
00:36:25,444 --> 00:36:28,749
Yesterday you were singing, “You are
the light,” you are this thing.

350
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:36,300
All right, so what? I was just saying,
‘Yes, I am the light, I don’t know Myself.”

351
00:36:36,501 --> 00:36:40,220
That’s the state where you don’t know
you are the light.

352
00:36:40,421 --> 00:36:43,454
You just don’t know that. It doesn’t come
into your head.

353
00:36:43,655 --> 00:36:47,722
Even so many times you have sung, you have
said thousand names there are, everything,

354
00:36:47,923 --> 00:36:53,949
but it doesn’t come into My head that
this is Me you are talking about.

355
00:36:54,306 --> 00:36:58,240
Now when I say this I don’t know how
you will react.

356
00:36:58,441 --> 00:37:02,869
Because human beings are queer birds,
you see. You tell them something.

357
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:09,828
Maybe that your ego might come up and you
say, “Yes, yes, I am also just the same.”

358
00:37:10,029 --> 00:37:13,606
There are many, many who came like
that, that, “I am higher than Mataji.”

359
00:37:13,807 --> 00:37:20,832
Ba, ba maybe, I don’t know. There are
many who said that, “I am Kalki.”

360
00:37:21,033 --> 00:37:25,245
Nowadays there’s one fellow going round
saying, “I am Kalki, I am this, I am that.”

361
00:37:25,446 --> 00:37:30,869
All right, doesn’t matter. You be that,
very good idea.

362
00:37:41,386 --> 00:37:49,814
But if I say I am Adi Shakti that means
I don’t know what I am, really.

363
00:37:50,015 --> 00:37:52,776
I had to say because people said,
“Mother, you have to declare.”

364
00:37:52,977 --> 00:37:57,189
Declare what? Whatever I am, that I am.

365
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:01,728
Now I find by declaration you people
started

366
00:38:01,929 --> 00:38:05,500
growing more, so all right, have it
that way.

367
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:11,253
But there is no need for anyone to declare
anything or to say anything.

368
00:38:11,454 --> 00:38:18,839
That is the state one has to achieve.
But to get to that state you have to work.

369
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:25,153
And work is to spread Sahaja Yoga.
You have to enlighten many lights.

370
00:38:25,354 --> 00:38:30,368
That means you will realize that you are
the light which is enlightening all that,

371
00:38:30,569 --> 00:38:36,254
and then in a subtle way you will realize
that, “I am the light.”

372
00:38:36,455 --> 00:38:40,863
Many Sahaja Yogis are doing a lot of work
and working it out,

373
00:38:41,064 --> 00:38:45,794
spreading Sahaja Yoga. It’s a very great
thing that has happened.

374
00:38:45,995 --> 00:38:48,855
In so many countries, the way it has
spread,

375
00:38:49,056 --> 00:38:54,324
it has removed the darkness of religion
which was outside.

376
00:38:54,525 --> 00:39:02,917
It was darkness of so many - racialism,
thisism, thatism, all it has removed.

377
00:39:03,118 --> 00:39:10,418
So this has worked out, the cleansing.
For you to have the clean water to swim.

378
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:17,323
Once you start doing that then you realize
gradually

379
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:24,462
that now the sea is clean, we just watch,
we just see how it is working.

380
00:39:24,663 --> 00:39:28,519
I hope in your lifetime only, you achieve
this state

381
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:36,914
where you achieve your complete work
of self-realization to others.

382
00:39:37,115 --> 00:39:41,133
Those who do not give self-realization
to others, who just come for the pujas,

383
00:39:41,334 --> 00:39:45,712
this thing, are mediocres. They cannot
rise very high.

384
00:39:45,913 --> 00:39:49,278
This coming to puja is what, like, you just
rise higher with the puja

385
00:39:49,479 --> 00:39:53,345
then again you go down. But those
who steadily grow

386
00:39:53,546 --> 00:39:57,491
will grow into this state, I am sure,
in My lifetime

387
00:39:57,692 --> 00:40:02,189
I should be able to see such people
who are such that if they stand here

388
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:07,531
they emit peace, they emit light, they emit
everything. Because they are the light.

389
00:40:07,732 --> 00:40:11,005
They don’t have to enlighten, but they
are the light.

390
00:40:11,206 --> 00:40:16,726
Such a stage has to be developed
and to be worked out within yourself.

391
00:40:16,927 --> 00:40:20,336
And this state has been described
by so many poets,

392
00:40:20,537 --> 00:40:24,709
so many saints and everything, but they
were at that stage

393
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:27,913
and people thought, what is this they
are talking? They thought they were mad.

394
00:40:28,114 --> 00:40:30,555
Even for Christ, they thought He is to be
crucified,

395
00:40:30,756 --> 00:40:34,815
because they couldn’t understand it.
Now you are gradually growing

396
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:39,573
one by one, step by step, step by step,
so now you understand this.

397
00:40:39,774 --> 00:40:42,332
You understand Christ, you understand
all these people

398
00:40:42,533 --> 00:40:46,391
and at this stage you have still to work.

399
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:49,976
Those who do not work for Sahaja Yoga
cannot rise higher.

400
00:40:50,177 --> 00:40:54,841
You have to work for Sahaja Yoga, you have
to spread it more,

401
00:40:55,042 --> 00:41:00,038
you have to work it out, enjoy each other,
this brotherhood, everything.

402
00:41:00,244 --> 00:41:08,161
All the qualities of a beautiful
personality should be there.

403
00:41:08,362 --> 00:41:15,900
Unless and until you achieve that state,
then you can only rise higher to that stage

404
00:41:16,101 --> 00:41:20,979
which I am describing is a Sahaja Stithi.
In that state you will be perfect.

405
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:28,494
But you must get rid of all these things
and today is a day, also of Mahalakshmi.

406
00:41:28,732 --> 00:41:33,129
The first thing is, I think, this madness
about money.

407
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:37,063
This should be understood that it’s
real madness.

408
00:41:37,264 --> 00:41:40,103
Those who are rich have no money.
You ask a rich man, he’ll say,

409
00:41:40,304 --> 00:41:45,224
“Oh, I have no money.” Why? What is this
all this? This is no money.

410
00:41:45,425 --> 00:41:49,292
You ask the poor man, he has no money.
A rich man has no money.

411
00:41:49,493 --> 00:41:56,744
So it’s a kind of a greed which is never
satisfied, which never helps you.

412
00:41:56,945 --> 00:42:01,844
All these little, little things have
to first drop out.

413
00:42:02,045 --> 00:42:04,801
Then your work should cleanse you.
In your work you will know

414
00:42:05,002 --> 00:42:07,639
whether you are cleansing or not.
In the work you will know

415
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:14,095
how you are doing your work. Once that
is done, then I think I am sure

416
00:42:14,296 --> 00:42:19,663
some of you will achieve that state
in My lifetime, in your lifetime.

417
00:42:19,864 --> 00:42:23,257
That’s what I want today to tell you,
on a Diwali day,

418
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:28,158
that we have to become subtler and subtler
and subtler.

419
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:32,322
We should not be influenced by outside
things.

420
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:39,439
Like, the outside thing is that, some sort
of a fashion starts.

421
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:45,892
People who follow fashions are stupid.
They are like blind mices.

422
00:42:46,093 --> 00:42:50,531
Anybody can lead them into anything,
now do this, they do it. That, they do it.

423
00:42:50,732 --> 00:42:55,628
So if you try to follow any kind
of a thought

424
00:42:55,829 --> 00:42:58,841
which is given to us by somebody else,

425
00:42:59,042 --> 00:43:03,054
in that thought you’ll completely lose
yourself and you'll become,

426
00:43:03,255 --> 00:43:10,551
"I am this, I am Christian, I am Hindu,
I am Muslim, I am Muss leman." Stupidity.

427
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:19,361
You are your Self. You are the Spirit.
And when you become the Spirit

428
00:43:19,562 --> 00:43:24,875
then you start knowing so much and that
knowledge is very important.

429
00:43:25,076 --> 00:43:30,717
This is the gap between a saint and
a normal human being,

430
00:43:30,918 --> 00:43:34,227
which you have crossed gradually so you
know what are the problems

431
00:43:34,428 --> 00:43:37,774
of the human beings are and dealing
with human beings,

432
00:43:37,975 --> 00:43:41,293
you know how to deal with them.

433
00:43:41,531 --> 00:43:46,251
In Sahaja Yoga only the collective
consciousness, in modern times, has come.

434
00:43:46,452 --> 00:43:52,746
This collective consciousness, also
the saints had, but they would not say.

435
00:43:52,947 --> 00:43:57,213
They would not say anything. They would
not bother.

436
00:43:57,414 --> 00:44:02,059
All right, this fellow has this chakra,
let him go to hell. Doesn’t care.

437
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:05,286
It’s not a question of not caring, but
not bothered.

438
00:44:05,487 --> 00:44:10,254
They were sitting in a state which
was just recording, all right.

439
00:44:10,455 --> 00:44:13,670
An ugly man goes before the mirror,
all right,

440
00:44:13,871 --> 00:44:17,775
if a beautiful person goes before
the mirror is all right.

441
00:44:17,976 --> 00:44:25,101
In the same way these people start
allowing people to pass through

442
00:44:25,302 --> 00:44:28,167
but we have to understand, still we
have to grow.

443
00:44:28,368 --> 00:44:31,863
We have to still grow by working it out.

444
00:44:32,064 --> 00:44:38,050
Those people who are working it out
and spreading it all over

445
00:44:38,251 --> 00:44:43,599
are the ones which are really very
much there

446
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:53,439
and to them, I must say, the Paramchaitanya
is just their servant.

447
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:59,517
I have seen people who desire something,
it works out.

448
00:44:59,718 --> 00:45:02,761
They ask for something, it works out.

449
00:45:02,931 --> 00:45:06,563
For that, now, what should we have,
is the point.

450
00:45:06,764 --> 00:45:11,878
After getting realization, after getting
everything, what should we have

451
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:17,908
that we develop is the faith.
Faith in yourself.

452
00:45:18,109 --> 00:45:24,508
Faith in that you are the Spirit,

453
00:45:24,709 --> 00:45:30,507
that you have the light and you have
to enlighten others.

454
00:45:32,721 --> 00:45:37,016
This faith when it grows deeper and
deeper then you think,

455
00:45:37,216 --> 00:45:42,805
"Oh, what I am? I am the Spirit."

456
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:48,317
If you are the Spirit then this whole
nature is with you.

457
00:45:48,518 --> 00:45:55,126
I know of some Sahaja Yogis. One of them
was a fisherman.

458
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:59,520
He was doing Sahaja Yoga work. He has
tremendous faith in Me

459
00:45:59,721 --> 00:46:05,773
and somehow he was going to another
village to do Sahaja Yoga work.

460
00:46:05,974 --> 00:46:14,060
When he came out of his little hut he found
it’s all full of clouds, black clouds.

461
00:46:14,261 --> 00:46:17,197
So he raised his hand and said, “See now,
I’m going for Mother’s work.

462
00:46:17,383 --> 00:46:22,392
And you dare not start raining. You keep
as you are, hanging there

463
00:46:22,593 --> 00:46:26,948
till I finish my work,” you see. Because
he was going by boat.

464
00:46:27,149 --> 00:46:30,561
And other Sahaja Yogis thought,
“What is he talking about?”

465
00:46:30,762 --> 00:46:34,041
They all got into the boat, they reached
the other village.

466
00:46:34,242 --> 00:46:37,803
They gave realization to others,
he finished his lecturing, everything,

467
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:41,068
he came back on the shore and he entered
his house.

468
00:46:41,269 --> 00:46:47,062
When he was closing the door, “All right,
so go ahead,” he said. And he managed.

469
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:52,624
So the complete faith that this
Paramchaitanya is like your servant,

470
00:46:52,825 --> 00:46:58,789
is all the time waiting there to serve you.
Whatever you say will happen.

471
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:05,097
But first you must have complete faith
in yourself that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

472
00:47:05,298 --> 00:47:08,521
Even now I find, you see, people have
some lust,

473
00:47:08,722 --> 00:47:12,867
some sort of a horrible things in them.

474
00:47:13,068 --> 00:47:18,972
So first you must be established in Dharma.
Dharma, is, as you know, is righteousness.

475
00:47:19,173 --> 00:47:22,520
If you are in the righteousness, there’s
no question.

476
00:47:22,721 --> 00:47:26,079
There’s no question that this
Paramchaitanya won’t obey you.

477
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:31,585
But supposing you want today something
and it doesn’t work out,

478
00:47:31,786 --> 00:47:36,068
then even to get disappointed itself
is not a very good thing.

479
00:47:36,269 --> 00:47:45,108
Disappointment also is a sign of your
immaturity.

480
00:47:45,309 --> 00:47:48,595
What is there to be disappointed?

481
00:47:50,321 --> 00:47:55,602
Maybe that that was good for you. Supposing
I lose My way.

482
00:47:55,803 --> 00:48:00,360
I’m going this way and I lose My way,
I don’t know where to go.

483
00:48:00,561 --> 00:48:05,007
So I get lost, it’s all right. What is
there? Wherever I am, I am there.

484
00:48:05,208 --> 00:48:08,388
How can I be lost to Myself? And then
what I find,

485
00:48:08,589 --> 00:48:12,809
that I had to go that way because I was
to meet somebody,

486
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:16,860
I’ve been wanting to meet somebody and
meet that person there.

487
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:21,041
Can you imagine? Such things happen
with Me,

488
00:48:21,242 --> 00:48:24,806
and even if I don’t meet, so what? I was
to go that side.

489
00:48:25,007 --> 00:48:28,176
I have to leave some vibrations, perhaps.
It’s like that.

490
00:48:28,377 --> 00:48:35,898
So once you know that whatever you are
doing in command, full command,

491
00:48:36,099 --> 00:48:43,087
full faith, actually the whole authority
comes to you through your faith

492
00:48:43,288 --> 00:48:47,975
which word is satta in Sanskrit, meaning
the truth.

493
00:48:48,176 --> 00:48:52,082
The truth gives you the authority. If you
have the truth with you,

494
00:48:52,283 --> 00:48:55,396
you have the absolute truth with you
then you have the authority

495
00:48:55,597 --> 00:49:02,826
and the authority is such that that
authorizes you, not others, but to you.

496
00:49:03,027 --> 00:49:07,244
This authority that you have works
and works.

497
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:11,476
I've seen with simple Sahaja Yogis,
very simple uneducated also,

498
00:49:11,677 --> 00:49:16,777
are very powerful Sahaja Yogis, are very
powerful Sahaja Yogis.

499
00:49:16,978 --> 00:49:21,306
But they have one thing, is faith,
complete faith.

500
00:49:21,507 --> 00:49:27,221
Then another word in Sanskrit is titiksha,
means patience,

501
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:32,967
saburi - patience. You must have patience.

502
00:49:33,168 --> 00:49:35,959
If you don't have patience, you want
immediately something to be done.

503
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,717
How will you see the whole thing
working out?

504
00:49:38,926 --> 00:49:46,509
Many people are extremely jittery and
very fast-running.

505
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:52,640
This world is running so fast and you are
the ones who have stood out

506
00:49:52,841 --> 00:49:56,263
and watching this rat race. You are not
one of them.

507
00:49:56,464 --> 00:50:00,682
So must have titiksha, means you must
have patience.

508
00:50:00,883 --> 00:50:05,285
So you must have faith in yourself fully
and also patience,

509
00:50:05,486 --> 00:50:11,464
how Sahaja Yoga is working out or how
this Paramchaitanya is working out.

510
00:50:11,665 --> 00:50:15,807
If it works this way, all right, that way,
all right. It is some meaning.

511
00:50:16,008 --> 00:50:22,402
If it works this way, there's some meaning.
If it is that way it has some meaning.

512
00:50:22,612 --> 00:50:31,793
Now the another thing which is important
is the faith in your guru.

513
00:50:31,994 --> 00:50:38,699
If you have faith in your guru,
Paramchaitanya is kind to you.

514
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:44,380
It’s very helpful. But if you doubt, then
Paramchaitanya also doubts you

515
00:50:44,581 --> 00:50:47,932
because Paramchaitanya knows you through
your guru,

516
00:50:48,133 --> 00:50:53,069
whether it is Me or any other real guru,
it’s the same.

517
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:57,179
But with Me, of course, because, you know,
I’m very forgiving

518
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:03,293
so people start taking liberties. With
another guru, you see, he will beat them.

519
00:51:03,494 --> 00:51:07,937
He’ll do all kinds of horrible things
to you if you are not there.

520
00:51:08,138 --> 00:51:11,028
So I’ve told you many stories about
the gurus, how they treat -

521
00:51:11,229 --> 00:51:14,791
good gurus - their disciples.
But I forgive.

522
00:51:14,992 --> 00:51:17,857
I don’t say anything. Let it be,
it doesn’t matter.

523
00:51:18,058 --> 00:51:21,092
Because I think by leaving them alone only
they will rise

524
00:51:21,293 --> 00:51:23,428
and they will come up to this stage.

525
00:51:23,629 --> 00:51:27,801
But it happens sometimes that it may work
the other way round,

526
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:36,710
that if they are forgiven, then they take
it for granted. It's all right.

527
00:51:36,911 --> 00:51:40,207
There is freedom, you can take it for
granted, you can do what you like.

528
00:51:40,408 --> 00:51:44,839
You can get lost, you can... I have nothing
to say.

529
00:51:45,389 --> 00:51:50,064
So the faith in yourself is with patience
you watch

530
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:54,280
and do not get disappointed with anything
whatsoever.

531
00:51:54,481 --> 00:51:57,860
Now, just imagine so many people have got
realization,

532
00:51:58,061 --> 00:52:00,859
so many saints in this world, have you
seen?

533
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:05,538
Yesterday I was surprised the way
the French were singing so well.

534
00:52:05,738 --> 00:52:08,322
You know, first time I had to take
a harmonium

535
00:52:08,523 --> 00:52:14,914
to teach them how to sing one line.
Half an hour I tried, I couldn’t do.

536
00:52:16,701 --> 00:52:21,437
The same French have reached that state
of creativity.

537
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:26,847
You see, all your potential will rise.
It will express itself,

538
00:52:27,048 --> 00:52:30,915
but be careful not to get into ego
about it.

539
00:52:31,116 --> 00:52:35,678
Gradually it will flower and others
who are surrounding you

540
00:52:35,879 --> 00:52:39,471
will get the fragrance of it and they’ll
come to Sahaja Yoga.

541
00:52:39,672 --> 00:52:44,819
That is the blessing at that time,
the blessing of the real Divine will be

542
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:51,982
that you’ll be raised to the state which we
call as a perfect, ‘purnatva’, complete.

543
00:52:52,183 --> 00:52:56,505
That completeness will come. But you
judge yourself.

544
00:52:56,706 --> 00:53:04,144
Are you absolutely one with Sahaj? Are you
absolutely dedicated to Sahaj?

545
00:53:04,358 --> 00:53:10,935
Or other things are more important to you
than Sahaja Yoga? Then, go ahead.

546
00:53:13,916 --> 00:53:17,997
There is something to be understood
very clearly

547
00:53:18,198 --> 00:53:21,638
that there’s no competition in Sahaja Yoga.
Cannot be.

548
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:28,781
There’s no competition. There’s no envy,
there is no back biting, nothing.

549
00:53:28,982 --> 00:53:32,266
It is, you are different people. You are
saints.

550
00:53:32,467 --> 00:53:38,725
Your style is different. You are absolutely
above all these things.

551
00:53:38,926 --> 00:53:43,340
You cannot be dishonest, you cannot cheat
people, you cannot do this.

552
00:53:43,541 --> 00:53:47,724
And if you are doing that, even now,
then please try to understand

553
00:53:47,925 --> 00:53:52,214
that you have still to grow into it.

554
00:53:52,415 --> 00:53:56,892
Some big people think they are very
high up in Sahaja Yoga.

555
00:53:57,093 --> 00:54:01,304
It’s not so, it’s not so.

556
00:54:01,505 --> 00:54:08,455
If by thinking what you are, then
you are lost.

557
00:54:09,225 --> 00:54:13,482
What you have to do is to understand
“What have I done?

558
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:18,519
How many people have I given realization,
to how many people have talked about it?”

559
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,476
People are shy, even, to talk about
Sahaja Yoga.

560
00:54:21,677 --> 00:54:24,899
I have seen one lady was traveling
with Me. Very hot. I said, “Ba, ba

561
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:28,684
who is she, this one? I don’t know.”
So she told Me the name of her guru.

562
00:54:28,885 --> 00:54:32,132
She said, “My guru is like this, guru
like that, like that.”

563
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:36,453
I said, “My God, this heat coming out
of this woman and she’s talking so much.”

564
00:54:36,654 --> 00:54:40,936
But a Sahaja Yogi will not tell anybody
what is Sahaja Yoga.

565
00:54:41,137 --> 00:54:45,417
They feel shy. They’ll have a hundred
friends, they’ll meet a hundred friends

566
00:54:45,618 --> 00:54:49,748
but they will never tell them what Sahaja
Yoga is. They’ll be shy to tell them.

567
00:54:49,949 --> 00:54:53,782
Ah, they wouldn’t mind going to parties,
you see, if the others are drinking,

568
00:54:53,983 --> 00:54:57,713
they’ll say, “All right, I don’t drink.”
But they’ll not say, “I’m a Sahaja Yogi,

569
00:54:57,914 --> 00:55:03,678
I cannot drink, by nature I cannot drink.”
They will not say that.

570
00:55:03,879 --> 00:55:09,256
So this is the third point, one has to know
the announcement.

571
00:55:09,457 --> 00:55:13,126
You must have faith in yourself and you
must announce.

572
00:55:13,327 --> 00:55:16,283
All the saints announced. They were
killed for that,

573
00:55:16,484 --> 00:55:21,142
you saw how Socrates was given poison.
Doesn’t matter.

574
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:23,963
Nobody’s going to kill you now, in these
modern times,

575
00:55:24,164 --> 00:55:26,062
there’s fundamental rights to exist.

576
00:55:26,263 --> 00:55:29,506
So nobody can kill you, take it from Me,
but you must announce.

577
00:55:29,707 --> 00:55:32,436
And the announcement should be
with full faith

578
00:55:32,637 --> 00:55:38,549
and understanding about Sahaja Yoga,
how important it is.

579
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:44,549
The purpose is to transform the whole
world.

580
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:48,154
With your transformation the whole world
transforms.

581
00:55:48,355 --> 00:55:54,733
It’s a very complicated thing, otherwise,
Sahaja Yoga is extremely complicated

582
00:55:54,934 --> 00:56:01,647
because how it works. The other day, you
remember, the mike had failed completely

583
00:56:01,848 --> 00:56:06,332
and I was giving the lecture and still
I was talking.

584
00:56:06,533 --> 00:56:12,315
The mike had failed but everybody was
listening to Me. What had happened?

585
00:56:12,516 --> 00:56:16,407
Did I enter into the ether? What happened?
I don’t know.

586
00:56:16,608 --> 00:56:20,825
I didn’t even know that mike had failed.
I was thinking there is mike,

587
00:56:21,026 --> 00:56:24,212
that the way people were listening to Me,

588
00:56:24,427 --> 00:56:28,230
but then they told that half lecture was
without the mike.

589
00:56:28,431 --> 00:56:34,314
And everybody was absolutely listening
to Me.

590
00:56:34,515 --> 00:56:45,770
You see, it is something that one has
to wonder and appreciate

591
00:56:45,971 --> 00:56:49,221
what things are happening now, where are
we going.

592
00:56:49,422 --> 00:56:52,428
We are going into the Kingdom of God

593
00:56:52,629 --> 00:56:56,894
and all the blessings, all the bliss
will be on you.

594
00:56:57,095 --> 00:57:04,537
Then this bliss, knowledge, everything
becomes one, nothing but bliss

595
00:57:04,738 --> 00:57:12,044
and you are in that state of bliss which
you don’t even know, we are just there.

596
00:57:12,245 --> 00:57:18,202
The greatest bliss is that you don’t know
even anything, you’re just there.

597
00:57:18,403 --> 00:57:23,371
I hope all of you achieve that state with
this Diwali being done in Portugal,

598
00:57:23,571 --> 00:57:26,969
which is a special place, I think,
of Mahalakshmi

599
00:57:27,215 --> 00:57:32,154
because She appeared here as they say
and also this swayambhu that we have,

600
00:57:32,355 --> 00:57:37,580
also is that of Mahalakshmi face, so I’m
sure it will work out for all of you.

601
00:57:37,743 --> 00:57:44,767
It’s a little subtle state I’m talking
about but it is, I have to tell you,

602
00:57:44,968 --> 00:57:47,971
that one has to rise up to that state

603
00:57:48,172 --> 00:57:52,961
and that state is very, very easy
to achieve for you.

604
00:57:53,162 --> 00:57:56,747
It slowly, gradually it - then you don’t
have to do anything,

605
00:57:56,947 --> 00:58:00,580
you go into a village and everything would
be there. See, now, what happened.

606
00:58:00,781 --> 00:58:06,021
I went to Cairo. Everybody was saluting Me.
I was wondering, what has happened to them?

607
00:58:06,222 --> 00:58:09,363
I went to Leningrad, thousands came
to My program.

608
00:58:09,564 --> 00:58:11,966
I asked them, “How did you come
to My program?” They said,

609
00:58:12,167 --> 00:58:15,600
“It’s obvious from Your face, it’s
obvious.”

610
00:58:15,769 --> 00:58:18,727
They just saw a small, little advertisement
in the newspaper,

611
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:23,563
“It’s obvious that You are Divine.”
That should happen.

612
00:58:23,764 --> 00:58:29,040
And then you can announce that Sahaja Yoga
is the only way, then you can announce.

613
00:58:29,241 --> 00:58:34,427
There’s no harm. People feel very shy to say
something to their friends and things.

614
00:58:34,628 --> 00:58:38,454
And you must know that all of those
who you love, who you know,

615
00:58:38,655 --> 00:58:42,633
will go to hell or where - they’ll hang
in the limbo or what?

616
00:58:42,834 --> 00:58:45,652
If you have achieved it you should pull
them out also.

617
00:58:45,853 --> 00:58:49,584
They may not. They may not be seekers,
doesn’t matter now.

618
00:58:49,785 --> 00:58:52,604
I think we are finished with the seekers
now, must be -

619
00:58:52,805 --> 00:58:58,450
we must have people who are not so seeking,
it looks like that.

620
00:58:58,651 --> 00:59:02,242
So, may God bless you all.
