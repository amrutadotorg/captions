1994-1016 Public Program, Sao Paulo, Brazil

00:01:32.286 --> 00:01:37.129
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:01:42.308 --> 00:01:49.372
At the very outset, I have to say that truth is what it is.

00:01:54.443 --> 00:01:59.091
Can they hear Me? Ask them.

00:02:06.513 --> 00:02:12.046
You cannot change it. You cannot challenge it,

00:02:12.246 --> 00:02:19.066
and unfortunately, with this human awareness you cannot know it.

00:02:27.984 --> 00:02:34.469
In our evolutionary process, we have become human beings,

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:40.138
but still we don’t know the absolute truth.

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.686
A little slowly, you have to speak, it is fast, perhaps.

00:02:56.037 --> 00:02:59.363
Something more has to happen to us

00:02:59.563 --> 00:03:05.305
that we all know the absolute truth.

00:03:09.925 --> 00:03:13.459
Because we don’t know the absolute truth,

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:18.209
that’s why we have arguments.

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:24.240
We have problems, we quarrel and fight,

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.649
and ultimately we have wars.

00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:44.884
In all the scriptures, it is written that you are to be born again.

00:03:53.088 --> 00:03:56.200
Whatever I am going to tell you,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.480
you should not take it for granted.

00:04:06.394 --> 00:04:11.257
This blind faith has brought lots of problems to us.

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:21.503
But, you should keep your mind open as scientist

00:04:21.703 --> 00:04:26.730
and if you find what I am saying has been proved,

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.125
then as honest people you have to accept it.

00:04:40.972 --> 00:04:43.382
Because it is for your benevolence,

00:04:43.582 --> 00:04:48.858
for the benevolence of your family,
for the benevolence of your country,

00:04:49.058 --> 00:04:53.600
and for the benevolence of the whole World.

00:05:00.794 --> 00:05:04.148
Unfortunately, most of the problems come

00:05:04.348 --> 00:05:08.583
from human beings in this World.

00:05:13.174 --> 00:05:18.721
And almost all the problems of human beings

00:05:18.921 --> 00:05:23.510
come from these centres being in jeopardy.

00:05:31.281 --> 00:05:34.081
These subtle centres are responsible

00:05:34.281 --> 00:05:40.446
for our physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual being.

00:05:47.968 --> 00:05:55.482
You have been already told about this power
Kundalini, which resides in the sacrum bone.

00:06:01.443 --> 00:06:05.490
That means the Greek knew it’s a sacred bone.

00:06:09.865 --> 00:06:15.775
This power is the power of pure desire within you.

00:06:19.017 --> 00:06:23.091
All other desires are not pure,

00:06:24.943 --> 00:06:29.990
because we want to have, say for example,

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:35.307
today we want to have a house,
then tomorrow we want to have a car,

00:06:35.507 --> 00:06:42.228
then we want to have a helicopter, it
goes on like this from one to another.

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:54.070
According to economics, wants are not satiable in general.

00:06:59.038 --> 00:07:01.979
But, whether you are aware or not,

00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:08.483
the pure desire to become one with the divine is within you.

00:07:16.135 --> 00:07:18.842
In modern times, as predicted,

00:07:19.042 --> 00:07:24.489
many people who are seeking the truth have been born.

00:07:32.262 --> 00:07:39.660
I call it as a blossom time, but they
have called it by many other names.

00:07:44.509 --> 00:07:49.063
In the Koran, it is called as Ruh.

00:07:49.264 --> 00:07:56.237
No, I am sorry Kiyama, is Kiyama. Is called as Kiyama.

00:07:58.237 --> 00:08:02.440
And in the Bible, as the Last Judgement.

00:08:03.206 --> 00:08:07.567
So, it is left to your freedom, whether you want to go to Heaven

00:08:07.767 --> 00:08:11.806
or you want to go to Hell.

00:08:16.853 --> 00:08:19.410
If we look at the science,

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:24.314
we should know that it has its own limitations.

00:08:27.929 --> 00:08:35.726
And while seeking the truth, we will
not know because it is so limited.

00:08:40.382 --> 00:08:42.768
Firstly, it is amoral

00:08:42.968 --> 00:08:47.742
and secondly, it cannot answer many questions.

00:08:53.673 --> 00:08:58.055
It cannot say why are we on this Earth.

00:09:01.048 --> 00:09:05.134
It cannot say what is our identity.

00:09:06.954 --> 00:09:09.559
So, people are changing their dresses,

00:09:09.759 --> 00:09:13.230
changing their hairstyles, all kinds of things they do

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:17.500
thinking that is their identity.

00:09:25.671 --> 00:09:29.726
But the identity is within you.

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:37.968
That is, you are not this body, this mind, this intellect,

00:09:38.168 --> 00:09:44.291
these emotions, these conditionings, this ego.

00:09:52.337 --> 00:09:56.614
But you are the pure spirit.

00:09:58.184 --> 00:10:01.453
When we say my intellect, my body,

00:10:01.653 --> 00:10:05.801
who is the owner of this "my"?

00:10:10.676 --> 00:10:19.122
The second truth is that there is a
all-pervading divine power of love,

00:10:23.621 --> 00:10:27.933
which does all the living work.

00:10:30.347 --> 00:10:34.252
We have never felt this divine power before.

00:10:36.064 --> 00:10:40.796
It is also called by different names.

00:10:44.913 --> 00:10:48.010
Some call it the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost,

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:55.827
and some call it as the all-pervading divine power of love.

00:11:02.567 --> 00:11:07.130
And some call it as Paramchaitanya.

00:11:09.255 --> 00:11:13.461
So, the second important thing at this time is that

00:11:13.661 --> 00:11:17.977
you have to become the spirit and you have to feel

00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:23.098
this all-pervading power on your central nervous system.

00:11:33.111 --> 00:11:37.473
If this does not happen, you will be restless.

00:11:37.673 --> 00:11:44.868
You’ll have all the problems and you will never feel satisfied in life.

00:11:52.888 --> 00:11:59.013
People have been seeking everywhere in these special times.

00:12:02.569 --> 00:12:06.197
They have been taking frantically so many things

00:12:06.397 --> 00:12:11.647
but they have not been able to understand what they are seeking.

00:12:18.849 --> 00:12:25.820
Firstly, we must know that it is a living process of evolution.

00:12:30.906 --> 00:12:34.605
You cannot pay for it.

00:12:34.805 --> 00:12:37.925
This is your own power

00:12:38.125 --> 00:12:45.391
and is your own potential glory has to be manifested.

00:12:53.596 --> 00:12:59.604
When this power rises within you it passes through six centres.

00:13:03.823 --> 00:13:07.663
It nourishes your six centres by which you get

00:13:07.863 --> 00:13:13.293
your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual problem solved.

00:13:20.855 --> 00:13:25.705
In India, in the Delhi University, there are four doctors now

00:13:25.906 --> 00:13:33.339
who have got their M.D. with Sahaja Yoga curing.

00:13:41.003 --> 00:13:46.303
It cures many diseases

00:13:46.503 --> 00:13:52.550
and is by your own power.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:00.448
Is very easy to know what diseases you have.

00:14:03.874 --> 00:14:08.218
Or, to know if you have mental problems

00:14:10.256 --> 00:14:16.072
because on your fingertips you can feel your centres.

00:14:22.728 --> 00:14:28.831
These centres are, he has shown as it is,

00:14:29.031 --> 00:14:33.391
even a child can make it out.

00:14:38.658 --> 00:14:46.274
Now, if you know how to cure these centres, you get alright.

00:14:52.149 --> 00:14:56.392
You can also feel the centres of others.

00:14:58.056 --> 00:15:02.041
Thus, you can cure others also

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:10.096
because you develop a new dimension in your awareness,

00:15:10.296 --> 00:15:14.631
which is called as collective consciousness.

00:15:22.021 --> 00:15:24.416
Second thing that happens to you,

00:15:24.616 --> 00:15:33.452
that you become absolutely thoughtlessly aware.

00:15:39.461 --> 00:15:45.078
If I say you that pay attention to yourself, you cannot pay.

00:15:49.983 --> 00:15:57.080
If I say that you stand in your presence, you cannot – present.

00:16:03.089 --> 00:16:08.263
We only think about the future or about the past.

00:16:10.708 --> 00:16:14.880
The past is finished and future doesn’t exist.

00:16:17.157 --> 00:16:21.785
So, to be in the present, something more has to happen

00:16:21.985 --> 00:16:26.203
because present is the reality.

00:16:31.024 --> 00:16:34.902
So, when this Kundalini rises, she elongates our thoughts

00:16:35.102 --> 00:16:39.730
and we become thoughtlessly aware.

00:16:47.648 --> 00:16:54.351
We are fully aware but there is no thought.

00:16:57.543 --> 00:16:59.866
If you want to think, you can think

00:17:00.066 --> 00:17:05.690
but actually you get divine inspirations.

00:17:13.766 --> 00:17:16.037
When you are thoughtlessly aware,

00:17:16.237 --> 00:17:20.784
you are absolutely peaceful within yourself.

00:17:26.628 --> 00:17:32.589
You watch the whole World like a drama and you are a witness.

00:17:37.057 --> 00:17:40.740
All your worries disappear, all your problems disappear,

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:45.018
you get out of them.

00:17:50.406 --> 00:17:55.266
As if the divine power takes over.

00:17:58.994 --> 00:18:01.161
Like this instrument [the mic] has no meaning

00:18:01.361 --> 00:18:03.958
unless and until it is connected to the mains,

00:18:04.158 --> 00:18:06.613
in the same way, our life has no meaning

00:18:06.813 --> 00:18:11.782
unless and until we are connected to this all-pervading power.

00:18:23.334 --> 00:18:28.410
Your attention also becomes very innocent,

00:18:31.011 --> 00:18:35.425
devoid of any lust or greed.

00:18:37.892 --> 00:18:42.176
When we take to religions, we should understand that

00:18:42.376 --> 00:18:47.939
today the religions have reached another state of perversion.

00:18:55.564 --> 00:18:58.134
They are money-orientated or power-orientated,

00:18:58.334 --> 00:19:02.467
and are fighting among themselves.

00:19:07.233 --> 00:19:12.555
One may call yourself as Christian, Hindu, Muslim, anything,

00:19:12.755 --> 00:19:17.365
anybody can commit any sin.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.394
Also, people like Christ and Mohammed Sahib,

00:19:26.594 --> 00:19:29.920
all such great people were really so pure

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:34.386
and did not know what sort of people they are facing.

00:19:43.024 --> 00:19:46.398
Whatever they have commanded is for the saints,

00:19:46.598 --> 00:19:52.153
for the enlightened ones but not for normal human beings.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:04.028
Normal beings cannot, normal human beings, cannot follow them.

00:20:06.978 --> 00:20:11.294
Like Christ has said in the 5th chapter of Matthews,

00:20:11.494 --> 00:20:16.651
that if your one eye commits a sin, you take it out.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:31.578
Or, if your hand does any sinful thing, you cut your hand.

00:20:36.002 --> 00:20:41.416
If somebody slaps on one cheek, turn the other cheek.

00:20:44.721 --> 00:20:50.776
I haven’t seen any Christian without eyes and without hands, so far.

00:20:53.198 --> 00:20:55.592
That means Christians are not Christians,

00:20:55.792 --> 00:20:59.940
they are not following Christ at all.

00:21:03.214 --> 00:21:06.870
Even Mohammed Sahib was worse.

00:21:09.214 --> 00:21:12.889
He thought all the rules and regulations are only for men,

00:21:13.089 --> 00:21:17.183
so do something more for women.

00:21:28.469 --> 00:21:32.222
So, he said any woman who has bad intentions

00:21:32.422 --> 00:21:37.299
about any man should be buried in the Mother Earth half-way

00:21:37.499 --> 00:21:42.742
and should be put to death with stones.

00:21:50.129 --> 00:21:56.363
Now, please tell me in America,
how many would live, American women?

00:22:00.044 --> 00:22:04.164
So, this kind of serious, very strict rules

00:22:04.364 --> 00:22:08.971
were made for ordinary human beings.

00:22:16.643 --> 00:22:20.177
Because they did not know what human beings are like,

00:22:20.377 --> 00:22:24.393
that’s why they crucified him.

00:22:26.974 --> 00:22:32.154
They had no sensitivity of spirituality.

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:40.834
So first, one has to become an enlightened soul, a saint,

00:22:41.034 --> 00:22:46.002
then only one can follow Christ or Mohammed Sahib.

00:22:53.809 --> 00:22:56.876
A normal human being is full of weaknesses

00:22:57.076 --> 00:23:03.083
and it’s too much to follow these great, great people.

00:23:10.498 --> 00:23:15.943
In Sahaja Yoga, we have no punishments.

00:23:18.882 --> 00:23:23.046
There’s only divine love.

00:23:23.484 --> 00:23:28.666
Because we understand as human beings as they are.

00:23:32.401 --> 00:23:34.426
But with the Kundalini awakening,

00:23:34.627 --> 00:23:40.092
you become exactly what Christ has asked you to be.

00:23:45.951 --> 00:23:52.697
That is, your attention becomes absolutely innocent,

00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:01.748
devoid of lust and greed.

00:24:03.138 --> 00:24:07.804
And this pure attention becomes very powerful.

00:24:13.148 --> 00:24:18.312
With this attention, which is so pure,

00:24:18.513 --> 00:24:22.515
the person emits peace and joy.

00:24:26.304 --> 00:24:30.440
And creates a very holy atmosphere.

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:36.885
It’s not talking but it’s a happening.

00:24:40.543 --> 00:24:46.348
It is no sermon but actualisation of the baptism.

00:24:51.597 --> 00:24:57.112
One has to know that you cannot pay for this living process.

00:25:01.797 --> 00:25:05.722
God does not understand money.

00:25:05.922 --> 00:25:11.913
You can pay for this hall but you cannot pay for your self-realisation.

00:25:17.616 --> 00:25:21.318
Or, for your enlightenment.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:27.086
If you just apply this test, to people, you will know

00:25:27.286 --> 00:25:31.002
who are false and who are real.

00:25:40.413 --> 00:25:44.056
In this short lecture, I may not be able to tell you

00:25:44.256 --> 00:25:48.186
all about Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:53.173 --> 00:25:55.403
Saha means ‘with’ and ja mean ‘born’.

00:25:55.603 --> 00:25:58.336
Born with you is the right to have this Yoga,

00:25:58.536 --> 00:26:02.559
means the union with the divine power.

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:18.068
This is your right; this is your birth right to have it.

00:26:23.107 --> 00:26:28.453
Last time, when I was driving, I went over São Paulo.

00:26:32.938 --> 00:26:40.909
And I felt there are many seekers here
because there were holy vibrations.

00:26:46.011 --> 00:26:52.575
And I asked them, please organize some program in São Paulo.

00:27:00.679 --> 00:27:05.468
Because there are so many real seekers here.

00:27:11.346 --> 00:27:18.683
And I am happy that you all have come for your self-realisation.

00:27:23.284 --> 00:27:29.795
Above all, you jump into the ocean of joy.

00:27:36.678 --> 00:27:43.196
Happiness and unhappiness are the two coins of one coin…

00:27:43.396 --> 00:27:47.458
I should say two sides of one coin.

00:27:51.075 --> 00:27:53.719
When your ego is pampered you feel happy

00:27:53.919 --> 00:27:57.724
and when it is punctured you feel unhappy.

00:28:06.437 --> 00:28:10.227
But joy is singular,

00:28:12.562 --> 00:28:16.688
where you witness the whole World

00:28:20.048 --> 00:28:26.273
and you see everything as a beautiful creation of God.

00:28:30.836 --> 00:28:33.062
And your attention is so powerful

00:28:33.263 --> 00:28:37.867
that you can solve so many problems of the World.

00:28:44.956 --> 00:28:50.077
You reach another state, which we call as doubtless awareness,

00:28:54.212 --> 00:28:58.387
where you get all the powers to raise the Kundalini of others,

00:28:58.587 --> 00:29:03.040
give them their self-knowledge.

00:29:11.698 --> 00:29:17.646
You can cure others, you can create peace on this Earth.

00:29:22.294 --> 00:29:26.530
Because you become innately righteous.

00:29:30.084 --> 00:29:34.305
I don’t have to tell you, "don’t do this, don’t do that."

00:29:37.547 --> 00:29:40.933
It’s like this, if I have a snake in my hand

00:29:41.133 --> 00:29:44.840
and I am very adamant; if you tell me there is a snake,

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:49.102
I won’t believe, I’ll say it’s a rope.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:30:00.361
Because, because there is darkness, I can’t see.

00:30:00.585 --> 00:30:04.628
because there is darkness, I can’t see.

00:30:07.792 --> 00:30:14.959
And I am adamant, I don’t want to believe
till the snake bites me, I don’t believe.

00:30:21.058 --> 00:30:27.154
But as soon as there is some light, I myself throw away the snake.

00:30:31.514 --> 00:30:36.107
All that is destructive in me, I give up.

00:30:38.332 --> 00:30:42.051
Nobody has to tell me.

00:30:43.262 --> 00:30:48.893
Such a state of righteousness, you have within yourself,

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:58.616
which is manifested.

00:30:58.816 --> 00:31:03.038
And then you come to know that all the religions were born

00:31:03.238 --> 00:31:08.571
as beautiful flowers on the same tree of spirituality.

00:31:15.758 --> 00:31:21.952
We pluck the flowers and we are fighting with the dead flowers.

00:31:27.192 --> 00:31:34.518
Thus, you transcend all these
limitations of racialism, of communalism,

00:31:34.719 --> 00:31:40.053
of all kinds of nonsense that we have been adhering to.

00:31:49.181 --> 00:31:52.838
All this is your own.

00:31:56.408 --> 00:32:02.806
Tonight, you all can get your enlightenment.

00:32:06.247 --> 00:32:13.802
You all can feel the all-pervading power of divine love.

00:32:16.963 --> 00:32:21.885
Only thing you have to have the pure desire

00:32:29.085 --> 00:32:33.483
and full confidence in yourself.

00:32:36.397 --> 00:32:40.452
Of course, I cannot force it on you.

00:32:41.944 --> 00:32:46.006
I respect your freedom as human beings.

00:32:48.156 --> 00:32:54.117
If you don’t want to have, you can leave the hall.

00:32:59.869 --> 00:33:04.080
It will hardly take 10-15 minutes.

00:33:06.665 --> 00:33:12.743
I know the people here are seekers, earnest seekers.

00:33:15.766 --> 00:33:21.538
And is your right to have your ascent.

00:33:25.616 --> 00:33:33.365
Firstly, this Kundalini is your own
mother, is your individual mother.

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:41.095
She knows all about you.

00:33:41.295 --> 00:33:48.071
She knows what mistakes you have committed and also she knows your aspirations.

00:33:53.063 --> 00:33:57.380
And she is very anxious to give you your second birth.

00:34:01.169 --> 00:34:07.483
So, you don’t have to worry about
yourself, please don’t judge yourself.

00:34:11.436 --> 00:34:14.655
Let her judge.

00:34:16.452 --> 00:34:20.386
So, you should be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

00:34:24.652 --> 00:34:34.252
So, the first and the foremost thing
we should have is self-confidence.

00:34:40.142 --> 00:34:44.230
And should not feel guilty about anything.

00:34:46.996 --> 00:34:50.862
This guilt is a horrible thing.

00:34:52.706 --> 00:34:54.949
This creates a problem on the left-hand side here

00:34:55.149 --> 00:35:01.972
on the left centre [showing left vishuddhi] and can give you lots of troubles.

00:35:08.234 --> 00:35:14.054
It gives you spondylitis, angina,

00:35:17.147 --> 00:35:20.923
it gives you lethargic organs,

00:35:21.853 --> 00:35:26.025
diseases like tuberculosis.

00:35:27.517 --> 00:35:31.135
So, why to have guilt?

00:35:33.408 --> 00:35:38.307
Whatever was wrong in the past is over now, finished.

00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:44.618
We are talking about the present.

00:35:46.266 --> 00:35:49.542
Please don’t feel guilty.

00:35:52.073 --> 00:35:59.596
Because if this centre is in problem,
the Kundalini won’t pass through.

00:36:05.018 --> 00:36:09.251
As I love you, you have to love yourself.

00:36:12.931 --> 00:36:17.462
Then another condition is that, you should not,

00:36:17.663 --> 00:36:22.840
you should forgive everyone.

00:36:27.996 --> 00:36:32.155
Some people think it is difficult.

00:36:34.053 --> 00:36:40.443
But logically, whether you forgive or
don’t forgive, you don’t do anything.

00:36:43.709 --> 00:36:48.084
But if you don’t forgive, then you torture yourself

00:36:51.741 --> 00:36:56.276
and play into wrong hands.

00:36:56.476 --> 00:37:01.319
But at this moment, it is very important to forgive.

00:37:03.857 --> 00:37:10.989
Because the centre at the optic chiasma
is constricted like this, like a cross.

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:19.247
And if you don’t forgive, it won’t open like this [shows square-shaped opening with fingers].

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:29.793
And at this important moment, Kundalini cannot pass through.

00:37:33.837 --> 00:37:41.238
As it is, you have tortured yourself
with this myth of not forgiving.

00:37:47.097 --> 00:37:52.901
And at this moment, you should not miss

00:37:53.101 --> 00:37:58.930
this great important thing of your life, is enlightenment.

00:38:05.327 --> 00:38:10.468
Also, you need not think about people whom you have to forgive

00:38:12.996 --> 00:38:16.835
because it’s a headache.

00:38:17.035 --> 00:38:20.937
In general, you have to forgive everyone.

00:38:24.046 --> 00:38:30.702
The third condition is that you have to take out your shoes.

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:37.759
I know it is very simple

00:38:38.814 --> 00:38:41.509
but in London, first time when I had a program,

00:38:41.709 --> 00:38:48.826
I asked them they have to take their shoes,
they walked out of the hall, half of them.

00:38:59.748 --> 00:39:04.086
So, Sahaja Yoga is not meant for stupid people.

00:39:06.101 --> 00:39:10.273
Is not meant for idiots, I should say.

00:39:12.722 --> 00:39:16.699
Also, it is not meant for arrogant people.

00:39:18.652 --> 00:39:22.994
You have to ask for your self-realisation,

00:39:23.194 --> 00:39:27.397
otherwise I cannot force it on you.

00:39:32.013 --> 00:39:36.044
But firstly, you should be humble.

00:39:44.401 --> 00:39:49.178
With so little advertisement and everything,

00:39:49.378 --> 00:39:55.254
so many of you have come, it’s very encouraging for all of us.

00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:06.880
You will get your sprouting, I would say, like a seed sprouts.

00:40:12.427 --> 00:40:16.467
Because it is all built-in within you.

00:40:18.677 --> 00:40:23.088
But it is a collective happening.

00:40:26.885 --> 00:40:32.602
You cannot be working it out in your homes and houses,

00:40:32.802 --> 00:40:37.052
you have to come to the collective to grow.

00:40:42.751 --> 00:40:49.082
What surprises me that when I go to any country,

00:40:49.282 --> 00:40:52.935
there are thousands who come.

00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:02.382
I don’t know how they have so much trust in Me,

00:41:02.582 --> 00:41:06.348
I am a foreigner for you.

00:41:10.254 --> 00:41:17.399
But later on, they don’t trust their
own people who are here to help you.

00:41:25.141 --> 00:41:29.060
They can help you to grow.

00:41:34.617 --> 00:41:39.070
Because after this, who is the other?

00:41:39.271 --> 00:41:42.975
Who is the other?

00:41:45.475 --> 00:41:49.725
You become collectively conscious.

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:57.567
The microcosm becomes macrocosm.

00:41:59.621 --> 00:42:03.434
A drop becomes the ocean.

00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:11.398
Such love, such friendship, such pure relationship

00:42:11.598 --> 00:42:16.704
develops that our society improves tremendously.

00:42:26.237 --> 00:42:33.742
There’s a lot to be said but I think first let us have our enlightenment.

00:42:41.133 --> 00:42:43.914
There are so many lights here,

00:42:44.114 --> 00:42:48.108
you have to just switch on and they come out

00:42:53.577 --> 00:42:57.681
because it is already built in.

00:43:00.524 --> 00:43:03.737
If I have to tell, you all the history of electricity

00:43:03.937 --> 00:43:08.882
and how it was brought here, you will be bored stiff.

00:43:14.713 --> 00:43:18.752
So, is better to put the lights on first.

00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:35.860
Now, it’s very simple as I told you.

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:42.131
I am happy you all have taken out your shoes without any grudges.

00:43:48.374 --> 00:43:52.765
You should be very pleasantly placed towards yourself.

00:43:56.013 --> 00:44:02.005
As I have told you, you don’t have to do anything, it’s spontaneous.

00:44:05.894 --> 00:44:09.686
Only for tonight, you’ll have to nourish your centres

00:44:09.886 --> 00:44:15.865
with your self-confidence which I’ll tell you how to do it.
