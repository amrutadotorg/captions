WEBVTT

00:14.009 --> 00:19.278
There are so many of you who have got realization very recently.

00:19.303 --> 00:22.882
Some people are such who have got their realization a few days back

00:22.907 --> 00:26.576
and there are some who have got their realization long back

00:26.783 --> 00:29.207
those who have understood

00:29.232 --> 00:34.117
what is one's own consciousness and how does it work?

00:34.142 --> 00:36.050
How does it work?

00:36.075 --> 00:40.375
And how do we go on adopting it.

00:40.955 --> 00:44.197
Because of being three types of people here

00:44.222 --> 00:46.646
I will have to repeat some of the points and tell you

00:46.671 --> 00:51.577
so that you will be able to understand, what does realzation mean

00:52.202 --> 00:54.792
What are the qualities of a realized person?

00:54.817 --> 00:56.927
Last time also I have told you a lot about

00:56.952 --> 00:59.066
what are the qualities of a realized person?

00:59.543 --> 01:06.100
And next, how should we be in our realized state

01:07.549 --> 01:10.044
In this way I will tell you about these three categories.

01:13.601 --> 01:15.324
This at least should be done

01:15.349 --> 01:17.047
that whatever you have studied currently

01:17.072 --> 01:19.834
whatever you have read here as well, forget that this moment.

01:27.020 --> 01:32.621
First of all, the question is what is the meaning of realization?

01:32.955 --> 01:36.061
When you come to My feet

01:38.465 --> 01:43.910
many people are told that they haven't got their realization

01:43.935 --> 01:47.853
and many are told that they have got their realization.

01:47.878 --> 01:54.358
It means first of all that realization has no connection with

01:54.398 --> 02:01.633
your outward body, mind or intellect but with some inner being

02:01.658 --> 02:05.618
which in some people gets connected, whereas in others doesn't.

02:08.909 --> 02:14.599
During your realization, when you are at My feet, at that time

02:14.624 --> 02:17.198
those who feel on the hands

02:17.223 --> 02:21.735
they feel the flow coming with a greater force on their hands.

02:22.338 --> 02:28.579
And you also feel something going into your feet.

02:30.294 --> 02:35.832
All around yourself, man's environment's

02:35.857 --> 02:39.885
and all around the whole world

02:39.910 --> 02:41.016
the CHAITANYA SHAKTI ( power of consciousness)

02:41.041 --> 02:44.686
is playing, inside and outside.

02:45.210 --> 02:48.284
For example, every tree has power of consciousness inside it.

02:48.309 --> 02:50.396
Its leaves also have the power of consciousness.

02:50.421 --> 02:52.574
Its root also has.

02:52.599 --> 02:53.967
In the same way

02:53.992 --> 02:59.384
the power of consciousness resides even in the whole universe.

02:59.670 --> 03:01.967
Just as Ether is present all around

03:01.992 --> 03:05.441
in the same way, this CHAITANYA SHAKTI is moving all around

03:05.466 --> 03:09.235
and inside, outside, everywhere is its abode.

03:13.358 --> 03:14.513
And the same shakti (CHAITANYA)

03:14.538 --> 03:19.820
goes on doing whatever complete work of JAD SHAKTI is to be done.

03:20.480 --> 03:27.542
Now this power within us is known as kundalini.

03:27.709 --> 03:32.649
But Kundalini is a word

03:32.674 --> 03:34.507
although, God has not

03:34.532 --> 03:38.378
given any meaning of anything, nor has He given any word

03:38.403 --> 03:39.680
For example, (God) has not named  anything

03:39.705 --> 03:43.561
but human beings have named it Kundalini.

03:43.862 --> 03:55.202
The power called Kundalini inside our being

03:55.227 --> 04:00.072
is situated at the base of our spine in the triangular bone.

04:00.097 --> 04:05.410
I am about to release an article about that in Manohar Shakti.

04:05.435 --> 04:08.065
You better read all the details of that

04:08.090 --> 04:12.256
and you will come to know the scietific names of that too.

04:12.281 --> 04:14.291
Many of you know that

04:15.827 --> 04:18.886
your attention

04:27.012 --> 04:35.692
your attention when you are an ordinary human being

04:38.811 --> 04:41.482
is on your body, intellect and mind, all the three.

04:41.507 --> 04:46.406
You go on seeking that thing which gives you joy.

04:48.628 --> 04:54.882
When you are at one with that CHAITANYA SHAKTI

04:58.522 --> 05:01.876
because of kundalini awakening

05:01.901 --> 05:06.347
at Sahastrara, your attention gets one with that

05:06.372 --> 05:13.416
then your attention goes to your Kundalini.

05:13.441 --> 05:16.228
And the moment it goes to your own kundalini

05:16.426 --> 05:20.317
your attention goes to other's kundalini as well.

05:21.729 --> 05:25.199
That means, till now your attention could go to three places

05:26.312 --> 05:28.818
and now it goes to fourth place

05:28.843 --> 05:31.126
which is NIRAKAR SHAKTI ( formless power).

05:31.151 --> 05:35.872
And the moment you go into that state, you go beyond your thoughts

05:35.897 --> 05:39.992
and watch you mind, intellect and body in the witness state.

05:42.299 --> 05:49.901
Now those from whose hands the cool breeze is flowing

05:53.634 --> 05:59.214
these vibrations we have got so effortlessly

05:59.239 --> 06:02.535
that we don't know what a great thing we have got!

06:02.560 --> 06:07.684
The first biggest problem is

06:07.709 --> 06:10.898
'How did we get such a great thing so easily?'

06:11.422 --> 06:13.924
For example, just understand like this

06:13.949 --> 06:19.213
that a human birth we get so easily

06:19.238 --> 06:24.026
that we don't know that to get a human birth

06:24.051 --> 06:27.067
after struggling for so many births

06:27.092 --> 06:30.034
with great difficulty we get human birth

06:30.725 --> 06:32.726
and its rebirth

06:33.284 --> 06:36.344
after a great struggle for all the births we had

06:36.403 --> 06:38.703
and after a lot of seeking, one can get rebirth.

06:39.347 --> 06:41.925
But this is happening so easily

06:41.950 --> 06:45.490
that we are not able to understand its value.

06:46.191 --> 06:50.048
We also think that how did it happen so quickly.

06:52.155 --> 06:56.633
The reason was that until now you were seeking everything outside

06:56.658 --> 06:59.021
and it is within you.

06:59.109 --> 07:01.730
For example, there is a diamond within you

07:01.755 --> 07:04.064
and you are searching for it all over the world

07:04.089 --> 07:05.948
and it was found lying within you only.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.647
Then someone tells you that the diamond is here only

07:08.672 --> 07:10.151
and tells you even the route.

07:10.176 --> 07:11.296
You pick up the diamond.

07:11.321 --> 07:14.642
Will you say,"How did i get it in no time?"

07:14.667 --> 07:15.758
You will only say

07:15.783 --> 07:19.057
"I was here only and why i was searching for it all over the world?"

07:19.658 --> 07:23.403
This is actually happening.

07:23.428 --> 07:26.699
When we get such a state on account of Sahaj Yoga

07:26.724 --> 07:33.790
actually we get it so easily

07:33.815 --> 07:36.396
that we cannot understand how did we achieve this state?

07:38.217 --> 07:45.543
Or say, that in the modern age, as you suddenly reach Moon

07:46.829 --> 07:47.865
You may not even know

07:47.890 --> 07:49.683
if you could reach Moon in a moment.

07:49.708 --> 07:52.859
If such an arrangement could be made

07:52.884 --> 07:58.307
it is quite possible that you will feel

07:58.332 --> 08:03.498
where did we reach?

08:03.523 --> 08:04.731
How is it possible?

08:04.756 --> 08:08.111
How did we reach Moon in a moment?

08:08.136 --> 08:12.016
In the same way this incident

08:12.112 --> 08:15.917
takes place so easily

08:16.619 --> 08:19.014
this incident takes place so easily

08:19.039 --> 08:22.172
that it is quite natural for you to feel so.

08:22.197 --> 08:26.146
But, if something happens easily

08:26.436 --> 08:29.506
or with a great difficulty

08:29.531 --> 08:32.784
you remember one which takes place with a great difficulty.

08:32.809 --> 08:35.841
And one can understand that, which happens with difficulty.

08:35.866 --> 08:37.997
It is man's nature.

08:38.022 --> 08:41.134
And a man considers himself blessed in that

08:41.159 --> 08:44.007
which he gets by doing his duty.

08:44.032 --> 08:47.035
Even if his father gives him one lakh rupees

08:47.060 --> 08:49.195
he doesn't understand its importance.

08:49.220 --> 08:52.556
If he earns even two rupees by dint of his hard work

08:52.581 --> 08:53.582
he has great importance for it

08:53.607 --> 08:55.238
as he feels it is because of his own effort.

08:55.245 --> 08:57.554
It is an indication of his own ego.

08:57.579 --> 09:00.025
It is the nature of his Ego.

09:00.050 --> 09:03.488
But in Sahaj Yoga when there is no Ego

09:03.513 --> 09:06.512
there is no question of getting anything because of Ego.

09:06.769 --> 09:09.927
So ego being dissatisfied

09:09.952 --> 09:12.433
raises such doubts within

09:12.458 --> 09:15.155
that why it is so in Sahaj?

09:16.818 --> 09:20.314
Methods of your own realization

09:20.339 --> 09:21.511
and all that happens

09:21.536 --> 09:23.473
(NOT CLEAR)

09:23.498 --> 09:25.914
many of you have felt it.

09:25.939 --> 09:29.775
you will find a new method in each book

09:29.800 --> 09:31.718
that when self realization takes place

09:31.743 --> 09:34.184
it happens like this, like that.

09:34.280 --> 09:37.697
Now how many of them are realized and how many are not, God knows.

09:39.259 --> 09:41.029
Out of you, those who have got realization

09:41.054 --> 09:43.922
and have acquired your ascent slowly

09:43.947 --> 09:46.754
you know that when a person gets realization

09:46.779 --> 09:48.750
only his Sahatrara breaks

09:48.775 --> 09:52.506
and he gets one with the vibrartions.

09:53.943 --> 09:58.770
After that he remains still here only

09:58.795 --> 10:02.654
and his attention goes to his own and other's kundalini

10:02.679 --> 10:05.850
but the vibrations that are coming inside his own self

10:05.875 --> 10:07.402
sometimes stop suddenly.

10:07.427 --> 10:10.151
And if he puts his hand on his head, he will find

10:10.176 --> 10:14.538
that the spot which had become soft, has become hard again

10:14.578 --> 10:15.578
gets calcified.

10:18.637 --> 10:20.934
(NOT CLEAR)

10:20.959 --> 10:25.315
You have got realization just yesterday and it has calcified.

10:25.340 --> 10:27.345
What is the reason?

10:27.370 --> 10:28.583
The reason is that

10:28.608 --> 10:34.421
our ego and superego inside us are definitely removed

10:34.446 --> 10:37.025
our attention comes in the center definitely

10:37.050 --> 10:40.789
but it grows again and and become one.

10:46.108 --> 10:48.909
It grows again becomes one

10:51.557 --> 10:54.657
and when it grows and becomes one

10:54.682 --> 10:58.277
the calcification takes place again and the flow stops

10:58.302 --> 11:00.793
but even then you can feel kundalini.

11:01.564 --> 11:02.743
But how?

11:02.768 --> 11:06.212
If after that you meditate and put your hands towards ME

11:06.562 --> 11:11.253
you will feel that this hand or thumb has caught up.

11:11.446 --> 11:12.802
They have got realization

11:13.065 --> 11:15.391
because those who are not realized

11:15.416 --> 11:18.421
those who are not realized, if they put their hands towards ME

11:18.468 --> 11:20.745
they won't feel anything.

11:20.770 --> 11:22.628
But those who have got their realization

11:22.653 --> 11:27.245
they will say ,"Mataji my this finger has caught up."

11:29.731 --> 11:32.889
They will feel that this finger of mine has caught up.

11:33.031 --> 11:35.329
or this finger of mine has caught up

11:35.354 --> 11:36.078
i am not getting in this

11:36.103 --> 11:36.894
i am getting in this (Pointing to particular fingers).

11:37.533 --> 11:40.724
Out of those who will be knowledgeable, they will understand

11:40.749 --> 11:44.217
which finger points to which chakra

11:44.744 --> 11:46.737
It is not an imaginary situation.

11:46.762 --> 11:49.188
This cannot be known through mental calculations.

11:49.213 --> 11:50.415
I didn't tell you.

11:50.440 --> 11:51.946
Because had I told you so

11:51.971 --> 11:54.078
people would have said, " Mataji is just talking uselessly."

11:54.103 --> 11:56.345
I said,"you find out."

11:56.370 --> 11:58.322
And when he put his hands like this

11:58.347 --> 12:00.534
and his this finger started burning

12:00.576 --> 12:03.339
I said, (To some sahaj yogi) put your hand on his Nabhi Chakra

12:03.364 --> 12:04.957
Nabhi Chakra was working.

12:04.982 --> 12:06.767
Close your eyes and feel within

12:06.792 --> 12:08.461
which chakra of yours is working?

12:08.486 --> 12:09.590
Nabhi Chakra is working

12:09.615 --> 12:11.312
and when you put your hand towards him

12:11.337 --> 12:12.848
which finger is burning, this finger is burning.

12:13.007 --> 12:15.988
It means that this finger corresponds to his Nabhi Chakra

12:16.304 --> 12:23.155
and everybody's this finger will catch.

12:23.180 --> 12:25.138
So without any discussion the point is that

12:25.163 --> 12:27.019
you may write a book or whatever you like to write

12:27.044 --> 12:31.464
the way a thing happens, it happens like that only.

12:31.489 --> 12:33.285
Yesterday, regarding Gyaneshwar ji

12:33.310 --> 12:35.790
a gentleman was arguing too much with me.

12:35.815 --> 12:37.110
Had Gyaneshwar ji been alive today

12:37.135 --> 12:39.453
I would have talked to Him Myself.

12:39.478 --> 12:41.469
He was also searching the method

12:41.494 --> 12:43.548
how to make this to understand

12:43.573 --> 12:47.980
but it was not possible as he died at a very young age.

12:48.005 --> 12:50.152
Like this, because of many such untimely deaths

12:50.177 --> 12:53.195
a lot of misconceptions have spread in the world.

12:53.220 --> 12:56.005
And he wrote a book, this was his another mistake.

12:56.030 --> 12:58.024
Because of that, I am scared of writing a book

12:58.049 --> 13:00.611
as just on writing a book, people will start learning it by heart

13:00.636 --> 13:03.419
and that too may condition people.

13:06.970 --> 13:09.963
And in this what happens and what does not happen

13:09.988 --> 13:11.769
exactly you must think

13:11.794 --> 13:15.535
that every minute i have a new experience, it is a new thing.

13:15.560 --> 13:17.932
We are new people, everything is new.

13:17.957 --> 13:20.860
We have to know everything new, we will settle down as new (people).

13:20.885 --> 13:22.637
Like a small child from his childhood

13:22.662 --> 13:25.044
listens a single word and goes on learning it

13:25.251 --> 13:27.572
checks repeatedly and understands it.

13:27.597 --> 13:30.449
In the same way those who are new

13:30.474 --> 13:34.465
those who have come in this kingdom of God

13:34.490 --> 13:37.509
should understand the divinity of this kingdom.

13:37.534 --> 13:39.886
His vision should be different.

13:39.911 --> 13:42.485
It has a great speciality that it has been named DIVYALOK.

13:42.510 --> 13:45.195
I would pass by here and would feel joyous to read its name

13:45.220 --> 13:47.420
Some great thoughtful person has named it.

13:47.445 --> 13:50.003
How beautiful the name is DIVYALOK?

13:51.629 --> 13:54.542
I didn't know that God will make all the arrangements here itself.

13:54.567 --> 13:58.111
Wish the other kindness be bestowed on us.

13:58.136 --> 14:01.410
It is a very beautiful place.

14:01.435 --> 14:04.089
The divine kingdom in which you have descended

14:04.114 --> 14:08.096
to know its divinity, you should think

14:08.121 --> 14:10.422
that all this is new.

14:10.447 --> 14:11.737
It is all original.

14:11.762 --> 14:13.814
There is all new experience.

14:13.839 --> 14:17.075
Somewhere written, old, shattered

14:17.100 --> 14:19.627
what others have experienced, it is not that.

14:19.652 --> 14:22.912
It is what we have to experience.

14:25.249 --> 14:31.125
So, absolutely new, like a new child

14:31.150 --> 14:33.690
in the same way, you come to a new form.

14:33.715 --> 14:35.866
The first thing important is that

14:35.891 --> 14:41.063
you pay attention to the newest concepts, all new.

14:41.088 --> 14:45.238
Till date nobody has experienced such a thing anywhere.

14:45.263 --> 14:49.496
This experiment was never successful so speedily, in this world.

14:49.521 --> 14:52.214
Because I too have come to this world many times

14:52.239 --> 14:55.337
and I tried to do this work many times.

14:55.362 --> 14:59.127
This work was successful for the first time in this birth (of Mine).

14:59.152 --> 15:05.369
So, the little incompleteness that has remained in everybody

15:05.394 --> 15:06.968
you have to complete that.

15:06.993 --> 15:10.869
You have come to complete that incompleteness.

15:10.894 --> 15:13.357
You have not come to overpower or reduce anyone

15:13.382 --> 15:20.829
You have come to complete whatever incompleteness has been left out.

15:20.854 --> 15:22.838
Now you think that

15:22.863 --> 15:32.454
you are new people of a new world and new dimension

15:32.479 --> 15:37.017
and you have to give guidance for the whole world.

15:37.042 --> 15:43.501
So, many realized people sitting under one roof

15:43.526 --> 15:47.946
are being blessed by that Divine Power

15:47.971 --> 15:54.200
How much powerful energy flows specially from.

15:54.225 --> 15:57.616
It is not so from other people of the world.

15:57.641 --> 16:01.898
You are aware of it. There is no doubt about it now.

16:01.923 --> 16:03.328
Some people have a little bit doubt.

16:03.353 --> 16:03.940
Its reason is that

16:03.965 --> 16:05.009
they have got their realization a few days back only.

16:05.034 --> 16:12.042
Within a few days they too will feel it.

16:12.067 --> 16:16.342
Then it becomes necessary

16:16.367 --> 16:22.171
that you understand your importance.

16:22.196 --> 16:27.267
Your greatest quality is that now you are in fourth dimension.

16:27.292 --> 16:30.266
which fourth dimension have you got?

16:32.759 --> 16:35.100
which fourth dimension have you got?

16:35.125 --> 16:37.756
The Chaitanya Shakti that is flowing in you

16:37.781 --> 16:40.806
you are standing in that.

16:40.831 --> 16:43.524
Now how can you go from this to that?

16:43.549 --> 16:48.207
it is a great important point, you try to understand it.

16:48.232 --> 16:54.400
Now how you can get off into it, manage to be in that state

16:54.425 --> 16:57.965
is an important point.

16:57.990 --> 17:00.683
Now if you observe your attention

17:00.708 --> 17:03.893
you will observe that there occurs a type of expansion

17:03.918 --> 17:05.723
it also stretches within itself.

17:05.748 --> 17:07.318
Feel your attention

17:07.343 --> 17:09.414
introspect your attention

17:09.439 --> 17:12.665
It seems as if it goes somewhere else

17:12.690 --> 17:13.885
and if you want you can get it back.

17:15.593 --> 17:19.492
Its expansion is going on and if you want you can get it back also.

17:19.517 --> 17:27.189
It is like a baloon which is called in Marathi 'phuga'.

17:27.214 --> 17:30.909
You blow it and it will go like this and then come back.

17:32.293 --> 17:35.131
In the same way you watch your attention

17:35.156 --> 17:40.452
your attention can go towards anything as well as return back

17:40.477 --> 17:44.175
NOT CLEAR

17:44.200 --> 17:47.710
See our attention has gone towards some object.

17:47.734 --> 17:52.258
For example, your attention is on some saree.

17:52.283 --> 17:57.777
Your attention has gone towards saree but you can pull it back.

17:57.802 --> 18:03.337
As per your desire, you can minimize or maximize your attention

18:03.362 --> 18:05.902
and you can take it wherever you want.

18:05.927 --> 18:08.543
But you are fully involved in the center.

18:08.568 --> 18:09.793
For example, take the case of sea.

18:09.818 --> 18:13.944
the water from the sea overflows all its banks and returns back.

18:13.969 --> 18:16.988
but in the center, everything of the sea

18:17.013 --> 18:19.968
has its own abode (VASTAVYA)

18:19.993 --> 18:23.464
all that is VASTAVYA

18:23.489 --> 18:25.647
that which is going to happen, is inside.

18:25.672 --> 18:29.464
Its reaction is awareness.

18:29.489 --> 18:32.518
It goes to something and returns back.

18:32.543 --> 18:36.007
You learn detachment from this.

18:36.032 --> 18:39.217
From this only we tell you to get detatched.

18:39.242 --> 18:41.873
For example that car came here.

18:41.898 --> 18:45.190
It is a minor issue. it is giving out some smell

18:45.215 --> 18:47.777
First of all, it gave out foul smell, o.k!

18:47.802 --> 18:51.059
If you pay attention to the foul smell, we will feel it.

18:51.084 --> 18:52.373
You divert your attention, you will not feel foul smell.

18:55.695 --> 18:58.959
You are getting the power of detachment within you.

18:58.984 --> 19:02.249
By and by you practice over your attention

19:02.274 --> 19:09.975
Man endowed with all religious knowledge is sitting in the center.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.825
He is paying attention to everything.

19:11.850 --> 19:14.471
What is this, what is this, what is this?

19:14.496 --> 19:17.348
This is also,This is also, people say all this is mine.

19:17.373 --> 19:19.146
Pay your attention to that

19:19.171 --> 19:21.697
and the moment you pay attention to that

19:21.722 --> 19:24.324
you know very well that I can take it back as well from there.

19:24.349 --> 19:27.094
Your attention cannot get involved in any such thing

19:30.399 --> 19:36.065
and whatever love you will attatch to it or do anything

19:36.090 --> 19:39.086
that will only hit it with a stone and come back

19:39.111 --> 19:42.877
but will not get attatched to it.

19:42.902 --> 19:44.379
Try to understand it.

19:44.404 --> 19:47.097
Eirlier when you would pay your attention to a thing

19:47.122 --> 19:48.302
with the help of your thoughts.

19:48.327 --> 19:50.742
For example, if anything moves from here

19:50.767 --> 19:54.165
that will go on moving as a whole and its range will be maintained.

19:54.190 --> 19:55.896
NOT CLEAR

19:55.921 --> 19:57.868
Now the one that will get released from here

19:57.893 --> 20:00.076
will take a round turn and then will come towards you.

20:00.101 --> 20:01.445
There is nothing in the center.

20:01.473 --> 20:01.935
It is all vacant.

20:06.220 --> 20:07.901
Nowhere it will put a hurdle.

20:07.926 --> 20:11.147
In this way attatchment attracts everything.

20:11.172 --> 20:13.945
One gets rid of  body, mind and intellect definitely

20:13.970 --> 20:17.874
but of other misidentifications within us too.

20:17.899 --> 20:19.950
We are human beings first

20:19.975 --> 20:25.067
and finally this truth, and this truth also detaches from us

20:25.092 --> 20:29.826
because we do not give up our attatchment

20:29.851 --> 20:32.597
and the method to give up attatchment during meditation is

20:32.622 --> 20:36.304
that you increase your attention and enjoy it.

20:36.329 --> 20:37.106
Now it has increased.

20:37.131 --> 20:39.996
Go there and you get it back.

20:40.021 --> 20:44.543
This special power you got after your realization

20:44.568 --> 20:47.695
I have already told you a lot of things

20:47.720 --> 20:51.912
Apart from this, keep in mind that

20:51.937 --> 20:55.574
in deeper meditation you have to do

20:55.599 --> 20:59.747
expansion and stretching of your attention.

20:59.772 --> 21:03.015
When you will be stretching and expanding your attention

21:03.040 --> 21:06.706
you will be surprised that your depth has increased.

21:06.731 --> 21:12.159
Just imagine that if you spread a lot of wheat here

21:12.184 --> 21:16.111
the person who has spread a lot of wheat, his stretch will be more

21:16.135 --> 21:19.252
then when you collected wheat and piled up

21:19.410 --> 21:21.491
has its height increased or not?

21:21.516 --> 21:26.748
In the same way when you have wrapped up your attention

21:26.773 --> 21:29.115
your inner depth will increase

21:29.139 --> 21:31.514
and what knowledge you got

21:31.553 --> 21:33.020
it excited my laughter to know

21:33.045 --> 21:35.511
was i wrapped in this?

21:35.536 --> 21:37.861
Was it worth getting wrapped up into?

21:37.886 --> 21:40.581
Means it will appear that it was not so important.

21:40.606 --> 21:43.767
These are not at all very important issues of the world.

21:43.792 --> 21:47.041
In our country there is a boy who had got realization.

21:47.066 --> 21:48.783
He went for an interview.

21:48.808 --> 21:49.840
When he returned back

21:49.865 --> 21:51.124
I asked him have you got through the interview or not?

21:51.149 --> 21:53.449
He said," I don't feel anything, if i have got through or not.

21:53.474 --> 21:55.188
In case i get through, it is good, if not, no problem."

21:55.213 --> 21:57.430
Finally he was selected.

21:57.455 --> 22:00.288
Board people told ME

22:00.313 --> 22:03.806
He was a special boy. He came and was not afraid at all.

22:03.831 --> 22:08.712
He gave straight forward answers and left, he was not afraid at all.

22:09.629 --> 22:11.397
How is he so?

22:11.422 --> 22:13.754
I said,"I had told you that he is realized.

22:13.779 --> 22:17.201
You examine him specially to find out, what is so special about him?"

22:17.226 --> 22:19.393
He said,  "We observed that

22:19.418 --> 22:22.163
he came, he answered straight forwardly the questions he was put to."

22:22.188 --> 22:24.163
He didn't have any trickery, nor anything.

22:24.188 --> 22:27.074
He was very straight forward, talked straight forwardly

22:27.099 --> 22:28.999
and then he kept standing

22:29.024 --> 22:32.707
and said, if he gets through, well and good, otherwise no problem.

22:32.732 --> 22:35.610
Neither he disrespected us in any way

22:35.635 --> 22:39.923
nor he wagged his tail behind us.

22:42.155 --> 22:43.395
Attention is also like that.

22:43.420 --> 22:45.879
When there is deformation in attention

22:45.904 --> 22:49.455
man gets divinity when he gets realized.

22:49.480 --> 22:52.669
When his attention is messy everywhere

22:52.694 --> 22:54.701
his attention distorts.

22:54.726 --> 22:57.345
Just try to understand

22:57.370 --> 23:02.197
you must have seen, just as tendrils come out of many trees

23:02.222 --> 23:06.624
specially the creepers

23:06.649 --> 23:11.233
(tendrils) come out and catch hold of this, catch hold of that

23:11.258 --> 23:15.027
then slowly and slowly it climbs up.

23:15.066 --> 23:18.219
In the same way, a man who is not realized

23:18.244 --> 23:22.037
he also catches sometimes this, sometimes that and sometimes that.

23:22.062 --> 23:24.247
In this way he some how stands up.

23:24.272 --> 23:27.054
Sometimes he thinks that he doesn't have a position.

23:27.079 --> 23:28.734
How will i survive on the earth?

23:28.759 --> 23:30.076
Oh! i don't have money.

23:30.101 --> 23:31.648
How will i survive in the world?

23:31.673 --> 23:33.047
Oh! i don't have this

23:33.072 --> 23:34.564
How will i survive in the world?

23:34.589 --> 23:37.256
But the tree that stands on its trunk

23:37.281 --> 23:39.791
looks quite independant.

23:39.816 --> 23:42.426
But the same thing is happening to you too.

23:43.280 --> 23:45.384
You are no doubt standing on your trunk

23:45.408 --> 23:48.923
but because of fear you take out tentricles from inside

23:48.948 --> 23:54.264
catch hold of this, catch hold of that and so on.

23:54.289 --> 23:56.560
For example, you know where you are standing

23:56.585 --> 23:58.159
this is the second thing which you should know.

23:58.458 --> 24:01.913
First thing is that you should not control your attention.

24:01.938 --> 24:03.576
It should not be controlled.

24:03.601 --> 24:05.528
Attention will not be tangled at all.

24:05.553 --> 24:08.434
You try, it will never tangle

24:08.459 --> 24:10.772
You try in deep meditation.

24:10.796 --> 24:12.590
You may have any major question.

24:12.615 --> 24:14.935
You look at it.

24:14.960 --> 24:17.626
Just on looking at it, you will be surprised that

24:17.651 --> 24:19.760
your attention goes there and returns back.

24:19.785 --> 24:21.332
Attention cannot entangle anywhere.

24:21.357 --> 24:22.988
Then you just think.

24:23.013 --> 24:25.792
For example, a great sad incident has taken place.

24:25.817 --> 24:28.073
You think that here a very sad incident has taken place

24:28.098 --> 24:30.371
but the world is going on as usual.

24:30.396 --> 24:35.297
Sorrow and happiness is our mind's creation.

24:35.900 --> 24:42.139
What is it, that makes us very sad or very happy.

24:42.164 --> 24:49.877
Or what is it that we hate someone or love another.

24:49.901 --> 24:52.626
There is no such thing which should lead to it.

24:52.651 --> 24:59.493
By and by your attention will circulate with a great speed.

24:59.518 --> 25:03.807
and then when attention gets fixed, gets absolutely fixed

25:03.832 --> 25:06.292
whosoever we look at

25:07.022 --> 25:10.661
you have also seen that by touching somebody, our hands burn

25:10.686 --> 25:13.636
by working on somebody, we catch.

25:13.661 --> 25:16.183
In the beginning it will happen so.

25:16.935 --> 25:18.105
Be away from him.

25:18.130 --> 25:20.553
As far as possible, do not put your hand in the furnace.

25:20.578 --> 25:22.787
When a girl learns to cook food

25:22.812 --> 25:27.485
first of all she cooks on a small oven by wrapping a small cloth.

25:27.510 --> 25:32.316
when she learns to manage a little, then she starts cooking on a big oven.

25:32.341 --> 25:34.946
In that too, she first holds tongs

25:34.971 --> 25:36.776
then handles a TAWA (iron plate to bake bread)

25:36.801 --> 25:37.819
and bakes a ROTI (Indian bread) on it.

25:37.844 --> 25:42.093
When she becomes an expert, she makes ROTI with hands.

25:42.118 --> 25:45.107
She can put her hand in the oven as well.

25:45.132 --> 25:49.262
In the same way, in the beginning what we call an evil

25:49.287 --> 25:52.726
what we call bad even that will  (NOT CLEAR).

25:52.751 --> 25:57.695
And what we call evil, will by itself go out wherever you stand.

25:57.720 --> 26:00.423
It won't effect you.

26:00.448 --> 26:02.328
When you will be in such a state

26:02.353 --> 26:04.015
what is the need of Mother's protection?

26:04.040 --> 26:05.964
You will grow yourself.

26:08.802 --> 26:11.840
Then you won't catch from anyone , nothing

26:11.865 --> 26:13.098
whosoever may be at whatever place

26:13.123 --> 26:14.583
you go and find out nothing.

26:14.608 --> 26:17.486
He who reaches there, is running away from there.

26:17.511 --> 26:19.057
They themselves are not going to stay there.

26:19.082 --> 26:21.459
When you achieve that ability

26:21.484 --> 26:24.844
that day, these questions are appropriate for all times to come.

26:26.360 --> 26:28.672
But as I had told you that

26:28.697 --> 26:29.789
there are only two methods of it.

26:29.814 --> 26:33.669
One is inside meditation, and the other is external (NOT CLEAR).

26:33.694 --> 26:36.929
Now something is going out of your hand.

26:36.954 --> 26:41.532
First of all they speak of good KARMAS

26:41.557 --> 26:44.034
do good, do bad

26:44.059 --> 26:49.310
good or bad is man's thought process.

26:49.335 --> 26:51.250
When KARMA becomes AKARMA

26:51.275 --> 26:53.925
means if there is no such feeling that we are doing KARMA

26:53.950 --> 26:55.004
for example, there is light of the Sun

26:55.029 --> 26:56.236
what Karma is HE doing?

26:56.261 --> 26:58.660
HE is in AKARMA, but He is doing KARMA.

27:01.428 --> 27:03.816
When there is complete AKARMA

27:03.841 --> 27:06.647
that something is flowing in hand and happening

27:06.672 --> 27:10.212
whatever KARMAS of the past have accumulated inside us

27:10.237 --> 27:12.361
it is said that you will have to bear the reward of your actions.

27:12.386 --> 27:13.601
Many sick people come here

27:13.626 --> 27:15.245
saying, Mataji these are the rewards of our KARMAS.

27:15.270 --> 27:16.172
Will you take out these?

27:16.196 --> 27:19.004
I say, yes I will take these. Don't worry.

27:19.029 --> 27:21.658
When we come to Ganga ji, these should get washed off.

27:21.684 --> 27:24.882
If on account of your Karmas your hands and feet are paining

27:24.907 --> 27:26.760
if you have fallen sick and then got some trouble

27:26.785 --> 27:30.123
it hardly matters, I can take that.

27:30.148 --> 27:33.571
But your Karmas have travelled from your body to your mind.

27:35.719 --> 27:38.178
How will karmas from your mind dissolve?

27:40.932 --> 27:42.332
These are standing outside.

27:42.357 --> 27:44.405
Because of Mataji, your health has improved

27:44.430 --> 27:46.874
but these karmas are settled in the mind.

27:46.899 --> 27:48.082
You have got your realization

27:48.107 --> 27:50.142
still how will this filth come out?

27:50.167 --> 27:52.670
So, when you will be doing this karma

27:52.695 --> 27:54.735
it will all flow down into akarma.

27:56.705 --> 27:59.171
And as much you will do in this lifetime

27:59.196 --> 28:07.890
your karma will come to an end.

28:07.915 --> 28:10.739
By and by, when you will go on doing Karmas

28:10.764 --> 28:12.054
these will go on quiting like this.

28:12.078 --> 28:14.969
After all the cleanliness of your inside being is over

28:14.994 --> 28:17.333
the same feeling of pity inside your being

28:17.359 --> 28:21.465
liking and disliking nothing remains there.

28:21.490 --> 28:25.763
You are sitting, you may or may not get food to eat.

28:25.788 --> 28:26.946
Whatever work you are doing

28:26.971 --> 28:30.057
if you are an executive, or any entity of the world

28:30.082 --> 28:33.576
you are doing that work only which is of God.

28:33.601 --> 28:36.006
You are not doing any of your personal work.

28:36.031 --> 28:39.957
Its work is being done by your hands and you are unaware of it.

28:40.005 --> 28:42.964
For example, Sun is giving its own light.

28:42.989 --> 28:46.747
Moon is enjoying Sun's light within itself.

28:46.772 --> 28:52.572
The sea is ascending, descending and sending out clouds.

28:52.597 --> 28:54.157
Their karmas are active

28:54.182 --> 28:59.347
but nobody thinks that he is doing anything.

28:59.372 --> 29:01.723
There are trees, from trees fruits come out

29:01.748 --> 29:04.259
seeds come out of trees and then trees come out of these.

29:04.284 --> 29:06.198
How much occupied they are in such a major work?

29:06.223 --> 29:08.979
But none of them that they are doing anything.

29:09.004 --> 29:10.833
Everything goes on smoothly.

29:10.858 --> 29:13.163
Only man has a question.

29:13.188 --> 29:15.028
All of them are in harmony.

29:15.053 --> 29:16.538
We have questions

29:16.563 --> 29:21.501
because God Himself has given specially this boon of ego to mankind

29:21.526 --> 29:23.098
so that we know Him.

29:24.019 --> 29:27.245
But we have seen that ego doesn't die by striking it

29:27.270 --> 29:30.108
So it should depart by itself.

29:30.133 --> 29:31.891
That is the method of Sahajyoga.

29:31.916 --> 29:34.068
It exits by itself, that too you have seen.

29:34.093 --> 29:35.601
But what should be done?

29:35.626 --> 29:38.473
You should do yourself as much karma as you can

29:38.791 --> 29:42.350
and another is to go into deep meditation.

29:42.375 --> 29:47.700
unless you reach that stage where there is nothing called good or bad.

29:47.725 --> 29:49.546
You have seen ME, I go anywhere

29:49.571 --> 29:52.461
neither any negativity catches ME, nor any Bhoot

29:52.486 --> 29:54.709
neither MY finger, nor MY hand.

29:54.734 --> 29:56.555
Everytime there should be such flow only.

29:56.580 --> 29:59.246
Iif you feel any heat from MY head

29:59.271 --> 30:02.669
that means it is some negativity within you only

30:02.694 --> 30:06.070
it is an example in front of you.

30:06.095 --> 30:09.888
I am also like you only, but an example in front of you.

30:09.913 --> 30:12.235
In the same way, when you will be Shivji

30:12.260 --> 30:15.447
neither there will be any devil nor a bad being.

30:15.472 --> 30:18.293
Whosoever comes in front of you, should get mingled in your love

30:18.318 --> 30:20.058
and if he doesn't get, he will run away.

30:20.083 --> 30:21.630
When there will be such a situation

30:21.655 --> 30:25.868
that day you won't need this protection.

30:25.893 --> 30:29.428
You only have found out many ways to protect yourself.

30:29.453 --> 30:31.767
Whatever the methods are there

30:31.792 --> 30:35.860
if you want they can tell you what they use.

30:35.885 --> 30:38.551
Whatever they use or you can ask them

30:38.575 --> 30:44.221
for example, (MY) photograph, foot soak, giving bandhan to yourself

30:44.246 --> 30:48.879
to take different names and many other things

30:48.904 --> 30:51.640
for that if you want, you can talk to them

30:51.665 --> 30:52.963
and they will tell you everything.

30:52.988 --> 30:56.412
But a realized person during meditation

30:56.437 --> 30:59.131
first after sitting must introspect

30:59.156 --> 31:01.769
if there is any catch from what he is receiving.

31:01.794 --> 31:03.641
If we are getting vibrations

31:03.666 --> 31:05.356
If there are no vibrations, he should get rid of catches.

31:05.381 --> 31:07.498
How should he take it out and what should he do

31:07.523 --> 31:09.201
Sharad also can tell you, these people can tell you

31:09.226 --> 31:11.436
how the blocked vibrations have to be cleared.

31:11.461 --> 31:14.424
If there is burning sensation in hands, how should it be taken out.

31:14.449 --> 31:16.295
Take it out that time

31:16.320 --> 31:17.162
by taking the name (of the Diety of that chakra)

31:17.187 --> 31:18.682
it will come out.

31:18.707 --> 31:21.741
it will come out in such a way that you will feel it was never there.

31:21.766 --> 31:24.926
You catch from the atmosphere, from plants, from everywhere

31:24.951 --> 31:28.702
Your situation is just like a small girl who learns cooking food.

31:30.166 --> 31:33.228
When you will be expert in this field

31:33.253 --> 31:35.209
then only you will be real yogi.

31:35.234 --> 31:37.384
Because there will be complete efficiency

31:37.409 --> 31:39.398
you will have perfect knowledge

31:39.423 --> 31:41.909
and when you will have perfect knowledge

31:41.934 --> 31:43.703
then you yourself become the knowledge.

31:43.728 --> 31:48.365
Tthat means you don't do anything, all this works by itself.

31:48.390 --> 31:50.733
For example, if this (mike) becomes perfect

31:50.758 --> 31:54.107
and if MY voice is going perfectly into it

31:54.132 --> 31:56.128
it doesn't have to do anything, doesn't have to know anything

31:56.153 --> 31:58.207
it is recorded automatically.

31:58.231 --> 32:03.884
Because the speaker and the doer, care taker of all is God

32:03.909 --> 32:06.240
and is hovering over everybody's head.

32:07.002 --> 32:10.304
Realized souls should know one more thing

32:10.329 --> 32:12.703
it is very important

32:12.728 --> 32:16.104
after knowing this you in a way become dependant on it.

32:16.129 --> 32:19.339
God hovers over every realized soul.

32:19.364 --> 32:24.837
For example, just as spirits hover over any evil man

32:24.909 --> 32:34.820
in the same way, all the Gods are very eager to help

32:34.845 --> 32:36.441
those who are realized.

32:37.306 --> 32:41.731
They get the fragrance and continuously hover around them.

32:41.756 --> 32:45.363
Out of you, those who must have experienced it recently

32:45.388 --> 32:47.370
that day she was telling because

32:47.395 --> 32:51.524
her brother in law had been caught up by some spirit

32:51.549 --> 32:55.055
and around 3.30 p.m, he started feeling very uneasy

32:55.080 --> 32:56.387
and he started shouting and screeming.

32:56.412 --> 32:58.328
The outsiders too started shouting and screeming

32:58.352 --> 33:02.460
and said that after that, such bad ordour and bad smell came inside

33:02.485 --> 33:04.318
they could not understand what to do.

33:04.343 --> 33:06.731
They started taking the name of that

33:06.756 --> 33:08.149
and after that they started giving vibrations

33:08.174 --> 33:10.214
and as soon as he became cool

33:10.239 --> 33:14.134
great fragrance started coming and he became cool.

33:15.388 --> 33:17.879
In meditation, many of you too

33:17.904 --> 33:21.070
before or after realization, get fragrance multiple times.

33:21.095 --> 33:23.825
Vibrations give fragrance.

33:23.850 --> 33:26.097
Vibrations give lot of fragrance

33:26.122 --> 33:28.511
and mostly ALHAAD DAYINI (inner joy)

33:28.536 --> 33:30.191
that gives you fragrance.

33:30.216 --> 33:32.194
So whatever is non fragrant

33:32.219 --> 33:34.292
that can dissolve by itself

33:34.317 --> 33:37.753
when you keep your meditative state alright.

33:37.778 --> 33:39.210
Means you are correcting yourself.

33:39.235 --> 33:41.563
So, there is nothing to feel bad about it.

33:41.588 --> 33:43.084
You have seen that now a days

33:43.109 --> 33:44.337
while meditating your level is much higher

33:44.362 --> 33:47.602
Modi is of a higher level, he and Devde are of higher level.

33:47.627 --> 33:50.235
Chandu Bhai is there and there are many such people you know

33:50.260 --> 33:51.539
Shroff Sahib too has ascended much higher.

33:51.564 --> 33:53.082
Our Lal Sahab has ascended a lot

33:53.107 --> 33:55.583
Many people have ascended a lot.

33:55.608 --> 33:56.652
If I name them

33:56.677 --> 33:59.486
I feel mostly people have ascended a lot.

34:00.510 --> 34:03.652
Even then all of them catch a little bit.

34:03.677 --> 34:05.053
Whose name shall I take?

34:05.078 --> 34:06.924
Every body catches a little.

34:06.949 --> 34:09.123
Sharad had caught up very badly.

34:09.148 --> 34:11.556
Three days back, he had caught up very badly.

34:11.581 --> 34:13.012
Ok, it doesn't matter even if you catch.

34:13.037 --> 34:14.995
But you can understand that you have been caught up.

34:15.020 --> 34:16.365
That is why this is the situation.

34:16.390 --> 34:17.980
That you have caught up, is understood

34:18.005 --> 34:19.285
It is easy to take it out.

34:19.310 --> 34:21.118
For a realized person it is very easy.

34:21.402 --> 34:23.365
Somehow it should be taken out.

34:23.390 --> 34:25.588
How to take it out, what should be done

34:25.613 --> 34:27.358
what are the methods to take it out, these people know.

34:27.383 --> 34:29.931
You should experiment it with your ownself.

34:29.956 --> 34:33.137
You can take out even by standing in the sea

34:33.162 --> 34:36.710
because on getting realization, people would do foot soak.

34:36.735 --> 34:38.650
It is good because

34:38.675 --> 34:41.686
they used to get so much worried, their fingers would start burning.

34:41.711 --> 34:43.496
There is one Gagan Bhawda Maharaj.

34:43.521 --> 34:46.428
When he got his realization, he would sit in water.

34:46.453 --> 34:49.369
His fingers' size dimished because of getting burnt.

34:49.394 --> 34:51.698
He had acquired curative powers.

34:51.723 --> 34:52.669
But he didn't know

34:52.694 --> 34:55.202
why his fingers got burnt and why their size minimized.

34:57.164 --> 34:59.819
His fingers got shortened on account of burning

34:59.844 --> 35:02.206
because you know, your hands too go on burning.

35:02.231 --> 35:03.361
The innocent person didn't know(why it happened).

35:03.386 --> 35:05.178
Now he doesn't come to Mumbai.

35:05.203 --> 35:07.966
Because in Mumbai city hands burn so much

35:07.991 --> 35:10.423
because his hands may have been burning too much

35:10.448 --> 35:12.547
poor fellow didn't know how to set these right.

35:12.572 --> 35:14.264
Poor fellow moved and settled there.

35:14.875 --> 35:16.444
(NOT CLEAR)

35:16.469 --> 35:17.789
He settled there.

35:17.814 --> 35:20.414
He would keep sitting in water.

35:20.439 --> 35:21.894
At least you have somebody to tell you.

35:21.919 --> 35:22.936
Some knowledgeable person is there

35:22.961 --> 35:24.921
to make you understand that there is no harm if your hands burn.

35:24.946 --> 35:25.972
Take it (burning sensation) out this way

35:25.997 --> 35:27.700
and protect yourself.

35:27.725 --> 35:29.215
My brother in law's hands

35:29.240 --> 35:32.319
got burnt very badly on account of some people.

35:32.344 --> 35:34.760
He becomes absolutely nervous on seeing some people

35:34.785 --> 35:40.212
NOT CLEAR

35:41.632 --> 35:45.105
You think yourself that there is someone to give you this knowledge

35:45.130 --> 35:46.182
some one to convince you

35:46.207 --> 35:50.097
that after realization, how much dangerous the situation is.

35:50.122 --> 35:53.474
Anyone can catch you , you are absolutely small children

35:53.499 --> 35:59.469
and such small children

36:01.263 --> 36:05.276
it is necessary

36:05.300 --> 36:08.907
to safeguard your state

36:08.931 --> 36:13.799
You are always under MY protection

36:13.824 --> 36:16.363
and everytime I take care of you

36:16.388 --> 36:19.256
and a lot of love for all of you.

36:19.701 --> 36:22.813
Feel proud and also enjoy myself a lot.

36:22.838 --> 36:25.734
That is why I have sons and children.

36:25.759 --> 36:27.947
It is a matter of pride for ME

36:27.972 --> 36:28.976
(NOT CLEAR)

36:29.001 --> 36:33.044
But what you have got, don't waste that on useless things.

36:37.076 --> 36:39.281
All of you have experienced it.

36:39.306 --> 36:41.832
Sometime you ask Yadav, he will tell you.

36:41.857 --> 36:43.970
Just now Mr. Patil came and he was telling ME.

36:44.540 --> 36:46.714
Here are ladies, many of them can relate their experiences.

36:46.739 --> 36:49.530
How did they experience and how did they correct themselves.

36:49.840 --> 36:53.095
If there is any problem, I can definitely solve that

36:53.120 --> 36:54.820
but you also learn to do so a little bit.

36:54.845 --> 36:57.776
You also do, you also learn, you also know.

36:57.801 --> 37:00.661
You are the doctor and you are the medicine.

37:01.877 --> 37:04.741
It is going to flow from you only.

37:04.766 --> 37:06.763
Even if you get injured a little bit, doesn't matter.

37:06.788 --> 37:08.253
Mother is there to set you right.

37:08.278 --> 37:10.768
It is not a matter of worry.

37:10.792 --> 37:13.106
Such people were not existing earlier.

37:13.131 --> 37:15.935
Because even the people who have got their realization

37:15.960 --> 37:18.101
say how did we get realization, God save us.

37:18.800 --> 37:21.090
Such were the people in earlier days.

37:21.115 --> 37:23.642
After getting realization, they would sit with tongs in their hands.

37:23.667 --> 37:27.265
It was not their fault. They would beat them mercilessly.

37:27.290 --> 37:29.251
If somebody would come who would burn them

37:29.276 --> 37:31.415
from whom they would get heat

37:31.440 --> 37:33.177
they would beat him with tongs.

37:33.202 --> 37:35.553
They were called CHIMTEWALLA BABA (an ascetic carrying tongs).

37:35.578 --> 37:37.177
I have seen them in MY childhood

37:37.202 --> 37:40.646
I am so surprised that whosoever comes is hit with tongs.

37:40.671 --> 37:43.090
Whosoever is there call ME with great love.

37:43.115 --> 37:46.015
I have never hit anyone by any tong.

37:46.040 --> 37:47.539
Who will go to them?

37:47.564 --> 37:51.776
Its reason is that there was nobody to explain and make them understand.

37:51.801 --> 37:54.031
Now you are curing so many diseases of people

37:54.056 --> 37:56.460
you have cured even diseases like cancer.

37:56.485 --> 37:58.935
Such type of diseases you have cured just easily.

37:58.960 --> 38:00.698
So many types of negativities you have removed

38:00.723 --> 38:02.061
because you have done such a lot of work.

38:02.086 --> 38:05.368
It is sure that you will catch something or the other

38:05.393 --> 38:08.967
but there is a dispensary for that also.

38:08.992 --> 38:12.248
For you too there is a dispensary and a person who can tell you

38:12.273 --> 38:14.414
and also one who can explain the minutest details.

38:14.439 --> 38:16.518
There is nothing to be afraid of.

38:16.543 --> 38:17.931
Even then, if you are scared

38:17.956 --> 38:22.217
that means you cannot proceed further in this life.

38:22.242 --> 38:24.840
This is about realized people.

38:24.865 --> 38:28.225
But we should understand one more thing.

38:28.250 --> 38:31.356
There are many such saints who have died

38:31.381 --> 38:33.016
but they are not able to take their birth.

38:33.041 --> 38:34.134
Many people are trying

38:34.159 --> 38:35.427
but they are not able to take their birth.

38:35.452 --> 38:37.927
Because they are not getting such a being

38:37.999 --> 38:39.336
or may be there is some other problem.

38:39.361 --> 38:43.161
Such saints are planning like this

38:43.186 --> 38:46.911
that those who can never get realization among us

38:46.936 --> 38:48.788
there are so many in our country (INDIA)

38:48.813 --> 38:49.889
those who will never get realization

38:49.914 --> 38:52.300
because they have their such previous karmas.

38:52.325 --> 38:56.792
Some have done planchette [calling spirits]  where they have got stuck up

38:56.817 --> 38:59.202
or any such thing.

39:00.285 --> 39:02.786
They say that we should come into them.

39:03.757 --> 39:05.917
You will feel some negativity in them

39:05.942 --> 39:07.768
but they are not harmful.

39:07.793 --> 39:09.107
There is no need to quarrel with them.

39:09.132 --> 39:11.341
Although very clerical people among you

39:11.366 --> 39:14.095
will feel it quite strange that how is MATAJI saying such a thing.

39:14.209 --> 39:15.020
Don’t provoke them

39:15.045 --> 39:16.377
because if you provoke them then

39:16.402 --> 39:17.742
it can happen that the bhoots can go into them.

39:17.767 --> 39:19.841
Bhoots are already within them.

39:19.866 --> 39:21.530
If there will be no bhoots then the saints will come.

39:21.555 --> 39:23.681
When the saints come, our work will be done.

39:23.706 --> 39:26.439
That is why in many people the saints have resided.

39:26.464 --> 39:27.698
They have a great desire.

39:27.723 --> 39:31.784
They have expressed it to ME that they want to come.

39:31.809 --> 39:34.479
But if we come in the form of small children

39:34.504 --> 39:36.337
how can they help you?

39:36.690 --> 39:39.224
So it is better that such people who come to you

39:39.249 --> 39:41.551
and those who are unable to get realization

39:41.739 --> 39:42.444
can't see

39:42.468 --> 39:43.846
there are many people like that.

39:43.871 --> 39:45.613
Even if they are not getting realization

39:45.638 --> 39:47.096
there is no need to argue with them.

39:47.121 --> 39:48.407
They will keep on coming always.

39:48.432 --> 39:52.026
They will come for four years, for six years or even for ten years

39:52.051 --> 39:54.305
but don't argue with them.

39:54.330 --> 39:55.943
They are coming, let them sit.

39:55.968 --> 39:58.415
You know they have not got their realization.

39:58.440 --> 40:00.674
A person who has got realization once, will go on getting realization.

40:00.699 --> 40:03.298
But the one who has not got realization and is going in and out

40:03.323 --> 40:04.590
there is no need to get involved with him.

40:04.615 --> 40:07.015
Do you remember (NOT CLEAR)

40:07.040 --> 40:08.939
Only the saints will work on them

40:08.964 --> 40:11.007
because without that the work is not getting accomplished.

40:11.032 --> 40:15.217
All negativities will be removed only by saints

40:15.242 --> 40:17.834
because you cannot see these

40:17.859 --> 40:20.574
and you cannot go to the other world.

40:20.599 --> 40:22.642
So allow them to do this work.

40:22.667 --> 40:25.542
They say that they will come and go on doing the work

40:25.567 --> 40:27.407
and go on spreading MY work.

40:27.432 --> 40:30.229
They will not cure any one of you or do anything

40:30.254 --> 40:32.171
but they will do such type of work

40:32.196 --> 40:34.642
that they are for example such people with others

40:34.667 --> 40:36.947
they will be more strong in language.

40:36.972 --> 40:40.126
They will speak, will drag people ( to Sahajyoga)

40:40.151 --> 40:42.511
and bring many more people who want to come.

40:42.536 --> 40:45.856
There was such a person who had even written an article about ME.

40:45.881 --> 40:49.201
But he was too much scared and he ran away.

40:49.226 --> 40:51.078
They are never going to get realization.

40:51.103 --> 40:52.907
A decision was taken in his name

40:52.932 --> 40:55.003
and he was told to write about ME and he started writing about ME.

40:55.028 --> 40:59.209
After that the poor fellow got involved in some case

40:59.233 --> 41:01.173
that there was a different environment

41:01.198 --> 41:02.595
and he got involved in that.

41:02.620 --> 41:04.709
Such people should be saved.

41:04.734 --> 41:07.888
Keep them with saints. Atleast they will be well behaved

41:07.913 --> 41:09.010
and by coming to Sahajyoga

41:09.035 --> 41:10.782
they will never be attacked by any negativity

41:10.807 --> 41:12.131
they won't have any physical trouble

41:12.156 --> 41:13.348
they won't have any mental trouble

41:13.373 --> 41:14.510
and they will have wisdom

41:14.535 --> 41:16.630
because the saints do not trouble anyone.

41:16.655 --> 41:18.921
That is why saints are within them.

41:18.946 --> 41:20.691
but those who are heads of some religious establishment

41:20.716 --> 41:22.132
they too are hovering over you.

41:22.157 --> 41:23.426
They will help you.

41:23.451 --> 41:25.447
They are also helping you.

41:25.472 --> 41:28.141
They will protect you a lot.

41:28.166 --> 41:31.778
You will have physical, mental and intellectual protection.

41:31.950 --> 41:34.108
He will look after your worldly affairs.

41:34.133 --> 41:36.412
He will pay attention to your household

41:36.437 --> 41:38.941
will take care of your family and household.

41:38.966 --> 41:42.413
But you should completely surrender to God.

41:42.438 --> 41:44.798
There is a great responsibility on you.

41:44.823 --> 41:46.851
Today I wanted that

41:46.818 --> 41:49.925
if anyone has any question or wants to discuss anything

41:49.950 --> 41:50.544
they can do.

41:50.568 --> 41:56.288
Mr. Shroff told ME

41:56.313 --> 42:00.393
and you be like a gardener in a garden

42:00.418 --> 42:04.321
You have to see how to maintain this garden

42:04.346 --> 42:09.111
how to set it, how to plant it, how to maintain it

42:09.136 --> 42:11.052
everything you have to think.

42:11.077 --> 42:13.826
You think about it and tell ME how it can be done.

42:13.851 --> 42:15.939
One thing he said was correct.

42:15.964 --> 42:18.392
He was saying that if we give realization

42:18.417 --> 42:21.742
and don't do the follow ups

42:21.767 --> 42:23.775
then realization gets lost.

42:24.160 --> 42:25.160
It is a fact.

42:27.662 --> 42:31.659
if we even after giving realization

42:31.684 --> 42:35.115
don’t follow up and protect them

42:35.140 --> 42:38.163
we don't take them forward, take care of them

42:38.188 --> 42:41.762
it is quite possible that their realization will be lost

42:41.787 --> 42:43.711
And then it will awaken after a very long time

42:43.736 --> 42:44.944
till then they will be in trouble.

42:44.969 --> 42:46.976
So, all of you have to be collective

42:47.001 --> 42:49.722
and everybody should meet atleast once a month.

42:49.747 --> 42:53.131
Every realized person should meet once every month.

42:53.156 --> 42:58.919
Make it such a way that every month a letter should go to each one.

42:58.991 --> 43:01.992
Or publish a newspaper which everyone reads.

43:02.017 --> 43:04.476
It should be distributed for one month

43:04.501 --> 43:05.889
and no money should be charged.

43:05.914 --> 43:09.449
Do not pay money anywhere nor borrow from anyone.

43:09.474 --> 43:11.421
Do not get involved in money transaction

43:11.446 --> 43:14.052
even for making ashram, the land that Government will give.

43:14.077 --> 43:16.143
Even in that, never think like that

43:16.168 --> 43:17.888
then you will grow vegetables in that

43:17.913 --> 43:19.330
and then you are selling vegetables.

43:19.355 --> 43:22.183
There is no need of doing all this business.

43:22.208 --> 43:23.865
We don't have to earn money.

43:23.890 --> 43:25.070
Today you must have read

43:25.095 --> 43:27.576
What is the condition of the Chairman of State bank?

43:27.601 --> 43:30.144
He went to the ashram, gave him ninety lakhs

43:30.169 --> 43:32.401
20 lakhs were given elsewhere for making furniture.

43:32.425 --> 43:34.908
Is furniture made in ashram?

43:34.933 --> 43:35.607
Use your senses.

43:37.075 --> 43:40.564
You please do not make furniture to sell it

43:40.589 --> 43:42.684
otherwise tomorrow we will see that

43:42.709 --> 43:44.663
these people are making furniture.

43:44.688 --> 43:45.866
There is no need for that.

43:45.891 --> 43:48.406
It is forbidden for you to do gardening there.

43:48.431 --> 43:49.354
For this, you can engage a gardener.

43:49.379 --> 43:51.563
For doing such work ,there are many people.

43:51.588 --> 43:53.058
You are here for a special work.

43:53.083 --> 43:56.620
You have to help in meditation, vibrations

43:56.645 --> 43:59.663
and redressing the problems of others

43:59.688 --> 44:02.915
to give them vibrations, to awaken theiir chakras

44:02.940 --> 44:04.350
and to give them realization

44:04.375 --> 44:06.528
and so far as money is concerned , be away from it.

44:06.553 --> 44:09.072
Do not get involved in money transactions.

44:09.097 --> 44:13.680
Money should be arranged, take so much money

44:13.705 --> 44:15.810
and keep its account, there is no need for it.

44:16.069 --> 44:18.859
If you get involved with money and its accounts

44:18.884 --> 44:20.511
you will get caught up always.

44:20.536 --> 44:24.810
There is absolutely no connection of God and money.

44:24.835 --> 44:27.684
If someone gives you a place for free, it is fine.

44:27.709 --> 44:30.000
If he doesn't give , no problem.

44:30.025 --> 44:31.393
It is all God's work.

44:31.418 --> 44:34.013
If you are sitting at a place, if someone gave you a place to sit

44:34.038 --> 44:36.050
then he was God’s man who gave it

44:36.075 --> 44:38.852
and if he doesn't give, it does not matter.

44:38.877 --> 44:41.954
No one becomes God if he owns a place or land.

44:41.979 --> 44:43.724
There are many ashrams.

44:43.749 --> 44:45.129
You have not to make any ashram.

44:45.154 --> 44:46.931
So, do not pay your attention to that.

44:46.956 --> 44:49.233
Please do not pay your attention towards that.

44:49.307 --> 44:53.739
That we are going to do this or that, or do business in an ashram.

44:53.764 --> 44:55.733
I will never allow this to happen.

44:55.758 --> 44:57.825
And when I see that you are stuck in some business

44:57.850 --> 45:00.362
then it is not MY responsibility.

45:00.387 --> 45:04.077
You don't have to do any business of any type.

45:04.102 --> 45:08.314
You don't have to collect money in any way, for nothing at all.

45:08.339 --> 45:11.628
One person said to me that he will sell MY photos

45:11.653 --> 45:13.877
and then that money he will give money to ashram.

45:13.902 --> 45:17.342
I said, “Which ashram? Whose money you have to give? Who said so?

45:17.825 --> 45:20.362
NOT CLEAR

45:20.387 --> 45:23.302
There is no need to worry about all this.

45:23.327 --> 45:26.348
The One who is doing and looking after us is HE.

45:26.373 --> 45:28.839
We are not doing our work. We are doing His work.

45:28.864 --> 45:32.489
If HE wants, He will give and doesn’t want, won’t give.

45:32.513 --> 45:35.284
And the same work we do night and day of eating ‘filth’

45:35.309 --> 45:38.009
and if we are going to come here and do it, then it is of no use.

45:38.034 --> 45:39.947
Don’t give ME ideas like this.

45:39.972 --> 45:42.552
Because few people have given it and it pains Me badly.

45:42.577 --> 45:45.731
Please do not give such types of suggestions.

45:45.756 --> 45:47.886
That way I am very straight and innocent

45:47.911 --> 45:49.368
but I am very clever as well.

45:49.393 --> 45:51.683
I am not going to be bound by these tricks.

45:51.708 --> 45:53.993
I am telling you beforehand

45:54.018 --> 45:56.453
that if you try to trick Me into money matters

45:56.478 --> 45:57.822
I am not going to support you.

45:57.847 --> 46:00.545
Whether you get realization or not, it does not concern Me.

46:00.570 --> 46:01.934
First of all, you must realize that

46:01.959 --> 46:07.588
there is no connection between money and realization anywhere.

46:07.613 --> 46:10.862
The other thing is that there is no connection of this to politics.

46:10.887 --> 46:13.062
There will be such people also who will come to you

46:13.087 --> 46:14.826
and ask you to stand for election

46:14.851 --> 46:16.668
as you have such a large following.

46:16.693 --> 46:19.598
If you want to go into politics you better go

46:19.623 --> 46:22.041
but politics has been created by humans and not by God.

46:22.066 --> 46:24.743
If you have to stand at a place that belongs to God

46:24.768 --> 46:28.088
it has nothing to do with politics and government.

46:29.819 --> 46:30.953
This is the first thing to understand

46:32.887 --> 46:35.244
and it has no connection with position.

46:35.269 --> 46:37.800
If you think that you are a very senior trustee

46:37.825 --> 46:40.762
here, there are just two to four people

46:40.787 --> 46:45.448
but if someone thinks I am a very senior secretary

46:45.473 --> 46:48.583
or i am a chairman

46:48.607 --> 46:53.444
there is no connection with any ‘chair’.

46:53.469 --> 46:55.679
And neither is there any throne or seat.

46:55.735 --> 46:57.088
Remember this first of all.

46:57.113 --> 46:58.701
It is to talk amongst ourselves.

46:58.726 --> 47:01.505
It has neither any seat nor any throne.

47:01.530 --> 47:05.773
Shree Mataji speaks in Marathi

47:08.912 --> 47:11.606
Marathi

47:11.631 --> 47:13.338
No need to make any special seat.

47:13.363 --> 47:15.662
Who is sitting on Adi Shankaracharya’s seat now?

47:15.687 --> 47:16.882
Someone who is absolutely non-realized

47:16.907 --> 47:18.055
So nothing doing.

47:18.080 --> 47:19.503
Nobody is going to sit on any vehicle.

47:19.528 --> 47:21.400
Everyone is sitting on his own  vehicle.

47:21.425 --> 47:22.995
When you sit on someone’s  vehicle

47:23.020 --> 47:26.761
you are always afraid of being removed from that  vehicle.

47:26.786 --> 47:29.105
Sit on your own vehicle

47:29.130 --> 47:31.485
and by ruling over your own selves from your own vehicle

47:31.510 --> 47:35.325
a lot will be done.

47:35.350 --> 47:39.626
Just tie a knot of these few things.

47:39.651 --> 47:43.896
Third thing

47:43.921 --> 47:49.007
a noble character, good conduct and divinity

47:49.032 --> 47:52.507
without this you cannot proceed at all in this path.

47:52.532 --> 47:54.830
If you have some bad habits

47:54.855 --> 47:57.090
you will have to make an effort to give up.

47:57.115 --> 47:58.257
Take a vow on My feet.

47:58.282 --> 48:02.233
Actually, the fact is that now you have shakti within you.

48:02.258 --> 48:08.531
For example, Indians have a very bad habit of criticizing others.

48:08.556 --> 48:10.319
We are now connected with love

48:10.344 --> 48:11.877
We are all brothers and sisters.

48:11.902 --> 48:14.251
If something has happened amongst each other

48:14.276 --> 48:16.575
can be that someone’s foot slips

48:16.600 --> 48:20.042
it is not necessary that you go and discredit him all over the world.

48:20.067 --> 48:23.856
Come and tell Me, I can set it right.

48:23.881 --> 48:27.304
But to save your brothers even at the cost of your life

48:27.329 --> 48:29.213
it is your full responsibility

48:29.238 --> 48:35.448
for your brothers and sisters.

48:35.473 --> 48:38.468
For that whatever you have to do, we will have to save him.

48:38.493 --> 48:40.055
It is a moral responsibility.

48:40.080 --> 48:42.694
It does not mean you have to pay money for that.

48:42.719 --> 48:45.287
Do not lend any money to anyone.

48:45.312 --> 48:47.664
If someone asks for money don’t give a penny.

48:47.689 --> 48:51.128
There is no need to lend money to anyone.

48:53.210 --> 48:58.185
If some person, in his spiritual life

48:58.217 --> 49:01.660
where his Kundalini is being destroyed or falling

49:01.685 --> 49:04.167
if someone has got into some bad habits

49:04.192 --> 49:07.890
all of you should help with the help of your love.

49:09.208 --> 49:12.224
Till the Purity does not come into us fully

49:12.249 --> 49:15.399
our work will be left incomplete.

49:15.424 --> 49:19.228
You should know this that the eyes of the whole world are on you.

49:19.253 --> 49:23.113
By fixing these decorate Diwali with these.

49:23.138 --> 49:25.984
People's attention is not on the house

49:26.009 --> 49:29.096
but on the lamps that burn.

49:29.121 --> 49:33.213
The attention of whole world is on every one of you

49:33.238 --> 49:35.321
that after all those who have got realization

49:35.346 --> 49:36.513
and are curing sicknesses in the world

49:36.538 --> 49:37.767
how are they leading their own life?

49:42.576 --> 49:44.219
Criticizing this and criticizing that

49:44.244 --> 49:45.912
although till now I have not seen such criticism.

49:46.214 --> 49:48.220
Till today there is no criticism against (Sahaj yoga).

49:48.245 --> 49:49.744
But there is every possibility of it.

49:49.769 --> 49:52.960
If there is any problem, just come and tell me.

49:52.985 --> 49:54.924
No one is perfect as yet.

49:54.949 --> 49:58.615
So if anyone has any problem, just come and tell Me.

49:58.640 --> 50:04.720
I will cure that problem Myself.

50:04.745 --> 50:05.980
And whatever shortcomings you have

50:06.005 --> 50:07.799
never feel shy sharing with anyone (your brothers and sisters0.

50:07.824 --> 50:09.702
All of you are brothers and sisters.

50:09.727 --> 50:12.850
As soon as you say “This is catching in me”, it can be cleared.

50:12.875 --> 50:14.766
If you don’t tell them how can it be cleared?

50:15.436 --> 50:18.931
There is no need to feel bad as you know that every one catches

50:18.956 --> 50:23.782
All are doctors and doctors take free treatment among themselves.

50:23.807 --> 50:26.310
So all of you can get cured free of cost.

50:29.345 --> 50:32.333
You must have brotherhood among yourselves

50:32.358 --> 50:35.901
and keep your attention towards an extremely pure life.

50:38.504 --> 50:40.982
So purity is very necessary.

50:41.007 --> 50:42.992
Without that this work cannot be done.

50:43.017 --> 50:45.669
If I had spoken about purity before

50:45.694 --> 50:47.404
then it would have been a question of perversion

50:47.429 --> 50:50.445
that you clear out on one end and catch on another.

50:50.470 --> 50:52.874
You clear out on the second thing and you catch a third thing.

50:52.899 --> 50:54.897
But after realization, this problem is no more there.

50:54.922 --> 50:56.424
After realization

50:56.449 --> 50:58.129
a hole that has been made here ( on the top of the head)

50:58.154 --> 50:59.856
because of that everything will go out from here (Sahastrara).

50:59.881 --> 51:05.573
You leave one thing and it will go out from here.

51:05.598 --> 51:09.433
It will go out fully. It is not going to enter anywhere else.

51:09.458 --> 51:12.846
That is the advantage of the hole that has been made here

51:12.871 --> 51:14.888
Whatever habits you have, keep these in your mind

51:14.913 --> 51:16.627
and then take out from here.

51:16.652 --> 51:19.155
Wherever the habit is, you will feel heaviness.

51:19.180 --> 51:22.349
On the Nabhi, some like to eat a lot.

51:22.374 --> 51:25.131
It does'n't look nice to overeat. Pay attention to your Nabhi.

51:25.156 --> 51:27.219
Your Nabhi is here, a little higher.

51:27.244 --> 51:31.242
From Nabhi then slowly remove it.

51:31.267 --> 51:36.306
Then everything will come out, all the filth will come out.

51:36.331 --> 51:37.945
The reverse wind is blowing.

51:37.970 --> 51:39.715
Today, it is blowing from the reverse side.

51:39.740 --> 51:44.864
Just now Mr. Jode told me that now he breaths from here (top of head).

51:44.889 --> 51:46.930
It is good!

51:46.955 --> 51:50.465
seeing, listening

51:50.490 --> 51:54.711
smelling, taste everything is from here.

51:54.736 --> 51:56.934
Finally everything happens due to consciousness

51:56.959 --> 51:58.990
and when consciousness has come on the top of the head

51:59.015 --> 52:00.402
then it will be here only.

52:01.636 --> 52:03.309
The beating of the heart

52:03.334 --> 52:06.584
the work of the whole body is done from here (Sahasrara).

52:06.609 --> 52:10.641
So anything that you want to take out from within yourself

52:10.666 --> 52:13.149
then just press it and take it out from here

52:13.174 --> 52:15.826
Your habits will go by itself.

52:15.851 --> 52:18.403
All your habits will be released from here

52:18.428 --> 52:20.225
because now there is a hole, it is very helpful.

52:20.250 --> 52:21.650
The hole was not there

52:21.675 --> 52:24.658
So like they say that if you press the ocean from one side

52:24.683 --> 52:25.852
it grows on the other.

52:25.877 --> 52:30.267
But if a hole is made in it then it will flow out.

52:30.292 --> 52:32.902
So if you press it on the side, it will not go to the other side.

52:32.927 --> 52:34.546
It will come out.

52:34.571 --> 52:38.288
Make an effort and look towards yourself

52:38.313 --> 52:41.098
as to what is impure within us.

52:41.123 --> 52:44.070
Like our Mother’s name is Nirmala, so we too have to be Nirmal (Pure).

52:44.095 --> 52:48.280
And what is impure within us, and not within others.

52:48.305 --> 52:50.482
Again we come to the same thing.

52:50.507 --> 52:53.074
Just now I was watching that some were looking at others.

52:53.099 --> 52:57.427
No, no, I mean what is within us. Which “Hum” [Spirit] is it?

52:57.452 --> 53:01.030
What is it that is within us?

53:01.055 --> 53:04.032
These are our misidentifications

53:04.057 --> 53:06.563
means that we have thought of ourselves as Christians

53:06.588 --> 53:08.708
we are Muslims

53:08.733 --> 53:11.772
we are Hindus and the rest are useless.

53:11.797 --> 53:13.696
This is a misidentification.

53:13.721 --> 53:17.495
We Indians are the best, and the rest are useless.

53:17.519 --> 53:23.419
These all are misidentifications and all are false.

53:23.444 --> 53:28.464
There is just one truth that we are humans.That is the reality.

53:28.489 --> 53:32.391
First thing is that if you know this answer

53:32.416 --> 53:36.467
then you will understand the rest that you are.

53:36.492 --> 53:41.320
One must keep watching all your misidentifications each moment.

53:41.345 --> 53:43.419
What are we thinking at this moment?

53:43.444 --> 53:53.558
We are thinking that I have to go home and make food.

53:53.583 --> 53:57.549
NOT CLEAR

53:57.574 --> 54:02.987
Some are thinking about what happened in the office today?

54:03.012 --> 54:05.173
What will happen in the office tomorrow?

54:05.198 --> 54:07.070
People are thinking about various things

54:07.095 --> 54:09.078
and I know what all they are thinking about.

54:09.103 --> 54:11.607
You should listen to My lecture in Thoughtlessness.

54:11.632 --> 54:15.852
Not with these thoughts.

54:15.877 --> 54:20.025
The One who cooks for us is sitting here. We do not make food.

54:20.363 --> 54:22.701
Think about this once

54:23.672 --> 54:25.707
that when such a miracle has happened

54:25.732 --> 54:28.291
that just sitting here you have gone beyond thoughtlessness.

54:28.575 --> 54:30.229
We will see more miracles.

54:33.875 --> 54:39.788
Because matter is also made from that same Conscious Power.

54:39.813 --> 54:44.594
See this also.The Cook is sitting there.

54:44.619 --> 54:48.530
And your questions will get answered like this.

54:48.555 --> 54:51.182
As soon as you go into thoughtless awareness you will understand

54:51.207 --> 54:53.903
that you have come under the protection of God

54:53.928 --> 55:01.249
and in thoughtless awareness, this help has come inside your being.

55:01.274 --> 55:04.196
If you have any questions please ask Me today

55:04.221 --> 55:08.848
But do not meditate today as a lot of time has gone for meditation

55:08.873 --> 55:12.066
Next time we will have meditation.

55:12.091 --> 55:15.659
And at this moment let us have a puja or recite mantras

55:15.684 --> 55:18.316
by which you will be specially given a protection

55:18.341 --> 55:20.693
by which you will have no problem.

55:20.718 --> 55:22.561
There are many devils roaming around outside

55:22.586 --> 55:24.403
and you can get into trouble.

55:24.428 --> 55:25.559
You must come.

55:25.584 --> 55:27.098
After this, the programme is in Pune.

55:27.123 --> 55:29.278
Those who want to come to Pune can come to Pune also

55:29.303 --> 55:33.979
but if you attend this two week program, it will be better.

55:34.911 --> 55:36.876
Now, what I have said, just think about it.

55:36.901 --> 55:39.272
Now with My lecture, you cannot not get conditioned.

55:39.297 --> 55:42.403
Your conditionings will also go away.

55:42.428 --> 55:44.262
The main point is that it will be over.

55:44.287 --> 55:47.585
Conditionings will go away from here (Sahasrara).

55:47.610 --> 55:50.050
After realization, the greatest benefit is that

55:50.075 --> 55:52.213
nothing will now stick to you.

55:52.238 --> 55:55.645
Its gross will not stick to you, only its consciousness may stick.

55:56.464 --> 56:01.984
Even if I speak in Urdu, Farsi or French

56:02.009 --> 56:08.614
but the CHAITANYA that is flowing through the words will come into you

56:08.639 --> 56:11.537
So with this, the vibrations will flow into you.

56:11.562 --> 56:14.118
There is no need to understand the language.

56:14.143 --> 56:17.852
The love that is flowing from within is what is touching you.

56:17.877 --> 56:19.839
Like you may not know the name of the flower

56:19.864 --> 56:22.126
its honey will go into you.

56:22.151 --> 56:24.042
the fragrance will flow into you.

56:24.067 --> 56:26.759
The fragrance is the Consciousness

56:26.784 --> 56:28.860
and the flower is (NOT CLEAR)

56:28.885 --> 56:30.584
So, even if you don’t understand the name

56:30.609 --> 56:32.328
the fragrance comes to everyone.

56:32.353 --> 56:35.369
Each human being can smell a flower.

56:35.394 --> 56:38.871
Everyone can tell, he may be an English, French or Indian.

56:38.896 --> 56:42.177
Everyone can smell its fragrance.

56:42.202 --> 56:43.854
It doesn't need any language.

56:43.879 --> 56:45.120
In the same way

56:45.145 --> 56:48.841
God’s fragrance which is the Conscious Power can flow into anyone

56:48.866 --> 56:50.040
whatever may be his language.

56:50.065 --> 56:54.299
In this speech what I wanted to say was different

56:54.324 --> 56:57.602
and what I wanted to give was different.

56:57.627 --> 56:59.476
That has got established inside.

56:59.501 --> 57:02.845
Whatever the problems were, will be taken out from here (Sahasrara)

57:02.870 --> 57:04.218
A churning goes on inside

57:04.243 --> 57:05.000
And on account of that

57:05.025 --> 57:06.289
and whatever the chakra after taking a round

57:06.314 --> 57:07.830
wants to get rid of throw that out

57:07.855 --> 57:10.255
take it out with the help of your hand.

57:10.280 --> 57:12.280
Some may get a heavy head, take out that ( heaviness).

57:12.305 --> 57:15.984
If you are catching from someone, don’t worry

57:16.009 --> 57:19.503
even your heaviness will also go out with it.

57:19.528 --> 57:23.663
Like I said yesterday, take out with the left hand.

57:23.688 --> 57:33.008
If anyone wants to ask any question, please ask.
