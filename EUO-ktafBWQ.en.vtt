00:00:05.047 --> 00:00:10.460
“First of all, put your attention
to your heart and to your Spirit”

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:22.458
(...) God does look after all of us.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.445
He is compassion, He is love,
He has created us,

00:00:25.622 --> 00:00:29.020
He has made a beautiful
human being out of us,

00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:31.105
within us He has placed
all these centres,

00:00:31.306 --> 00:00:34.450
He has placed the Kundalini within us,
and the Kundalini has to rise,

00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:38.754
you have to get realization,
all that is so, no doubt.

00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:43.653
All this has to work out. That’s also
the truth is.

00:00:43.854 --> 00:00:50.184
But still, one must know that He is not
in your hand,

00:00:50.471 --> 00:00:53.256
you are in His hand.

00:00:53.457 --> 00:00:58.087
There are many people who pray to God:
“Give me promotion.

00:00:58.288 --> 00:01:01.683
O God, you have to give me promotion”.

00:01:01.884 --> 00:01:06.720
And then if He doesn’t give, “This God
is not helpful to me!

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:12.383
Why has He not given me promotion?” 
You should not cheapen God like that.

00:01:12.584 --> 00:01:17.656
God is the one Who is Almighty,
Who has created all this Universe.

00:01:17.857 --> 00:01:22.464
He has created you, and He has created
you for a purpose.

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:28.661
And that purpose is something Supreme.
That’s not ordinary purpose,

00:01:28.862 --> 00:01:33.167
the way you think Him to be, He is not
an ordinary person.

00:01:33.368 --> 00:01:37.163
He is Supreme and He will give you
something that is Supreme.

00:01:37.364 --> 00:01:44.910
Supposing you go to see some king,
he will not give you 1p, will he?

00:01:46.134 --> 00:01:49.025
He may give you a diamond.

00:01:49.226 --> 00:01:56.507
But if you want to ask anything from God
then you must ask for the Supreme!

00:01:56.708 --> 00:02:03.508
And what is the Supreme? The Supreme
is to know Him.

00:02:03.693 --> 00:02:08.829
Unless and until you know your Self,
you are not going to know Him.

00:02:09.482 --> 00:02:15.338
He has placed within you that instrument
by which you first know your Self.

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:20.757
Once you know your Self, through your Self
you know Him.

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:26.945
But the first important thing is that
your attention has to be on Him.

00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:31.794
There’s a very different thing to have
attention on God

00:02:31.995 --> 00:02:34.639
and to have a blind faith in God.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.271
These two things are absolutely
far apart.

00:02:40.472 --> 00:02:44.073
To have faith in God means – I’ve already
told you

00:02:44.275 --> 00:02:48.847
all the silly things we do in the name
of faith.

00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:53.440
But to have your attention on God is

00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:58.304
to ask: “When am I going to be my Self?

00:02:58.505 --> 00:03:04.040
When are You going to accept me
as a citizen of Your Kingdom?

00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:07.934
When are You going to use me 
as Your instrument, O Lord?”

00:03:08.135 --> 00:03:11.624
This should be your attention. 
If your attention is like that,

00:03:11.825 --> 00:03:16.277
and if you are really of pure nature
about it,

00:03:16.478 --> 00:03:19.411
it will work out, it works out.

00:03:19.612 --> 00:03:22.139
This is the only thing that is needed
in Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.059
is a clean heart to ask for it,
to desire for it.

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:31.284
(...) But today, we have to understand
one thing:

00:03:31.485 --> 00:03:36.948
that the essences within us – for example
innocence – is absolutely pure.

00:03:37.111 --> 00:03:43.172
Within us it is absolutely pure. In its own
form it is absolutely pure.

00:03:43.373 --> 00:03:49.787
But, when it is reflected through
our medium, it gets soiled.

00:03:50.241 --> 00:03:54.594
The way you are, the way you express it,
it gets spoiled.

00:03:54.795 --> 00:03:59.829
If you are a cunning person, the innocence
cannot be manifested,

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.648
it cannot be manifested. Your innocence,
whatever God has placed within you

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.329
is completely darkened because you
cannot reflect it back.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.993
There is no manifestation about it.
Why it happens?

00:04:15.194 --> 00:04:21.092
If you are pure, if you are all right,
the innocence is all right,

00:04:21.293 --> 00:04:24.376
then why it is not manifested through you?

00:04:24.577 --> 00:04:28.774
Why this cunningness can stop that
innocence or any other essences

00:04:28.975 --> 00:04:33.578
that are within you, which you know
which exist on different chakras?

00:04:33.753 --> 00:04:40.101
We must think about it, why it happens.
That even after realization,

00:04:40.302 --> 00:04:44.245
we cannot properly manifest our innocence,

00:04:44.446 --> 00:04:49.610
our primordial powers

00:04:49.811 --> 00:04:52.990
which are within us in absolute
purest form.

00:04:53.191 --> 00:05:00.252
Why? What happens within us?
The trouble is with our attention.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.210
When you became human beings,
you were given full freedom

00:05:04.411 --> 00:05:08.413
to put your attention onto anything
you wanted.

00:05:08.621 --> 00:05:15.351
Say, if you want, you can put your
attention onto any subject.

00:05:15.552 --> 00:05:19.584
Say I receive a telephone call.
So I put my attention to it.

00:05:19.785 --> 00:05:22.188
Now, I can go on identifying with it,
thinking about it;

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.333
all my attention will be enveloped
and I will not pay attention

00:05:25.534 --> 00:05:29.261
to anything else that is happening.

00:05:30.572 --> 00:05:33.946
The attention is so mobile, it has no base

00:05:34.147 --> 00:05:38.371
as if the whole thing, like a jelly,
goes and gets attached to a thing.

00:05:39.024 --> 00:05:42.356
(...) I mean if you waste your attention
on foolish nonsensical things,

00:05:42.557 --> 00:05:45.685
what’s going to happen?

00:05:46.552 --> 00:05:49.094
So this is how we put our attention

00:05:49.295 --> 00:05:56.575
onto absolutely useless things; sometimes
onto very depraved things also.

00:05:56.763 --> 00:05:59.276
We may put our attention to anything

00:05:59.477 --> 00:06:07.488
that we think “requires our attention”.
But do you have your self-esteem?

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:12.206
If you have, then where should be
your attention?

00:06:12.407 --> 00:06:17.779
It should be on your Self. Where is
your Self now?

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:25.604
It is God Almighty. Is a part of that
Great Primordial Being.

00:06:25.805 --> 00:06:30.838
Your attention should be on That.

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:36.343
After realization, your attention
should be in your heart,

00:06:36.561 --> 00:06:42.467
on your Spirit, which is the part
of God Almighty.

00:06:42.687 --> 00:06:49.808
If your attention is on your Spirit, you’ll 
be amazed, how your attention will act.

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:52.903
You see, like a jelly which is attached
to a point.

00:06:53.104 --> 00:06:56.044
It may little bit get disturbed, again
it will settle down.

00:06:56.253 --> 00:06:58.619
Again, it will get little bit disturbed,
it will settle down.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:04.628
It will not hang on to any point,
and will not bother you.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:08.239
So to put all your essences properly,
first of all,

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.142
put your attention to your heart
and to your Spirit,

00:07:13.343 --> 00:07:16.905
because that’s your absolute point
which you have discovered.

00:07:17.106 --> 00:07:19.321
But it doesn’t happen with many people.

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:24.809
The trouble is, when Kundalini rises,
She gives two kinds of experiences.

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.721
One is called as Shambhavi, another
called as Shakti.

00:07:28.922 --> 00:07:36.308
Shambhavi is the feeling of the Shambhu, is
the Shiva in the heart, means God Almighty.

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:39.038
But the other is Shakti.

00:07:39.239 --> 00:07:44.102
Now with western people it is the other,
because you know your problems.

00:07:44.303 --> 00:07:50.697
You have used your powers for all kinds 
of ramblings in your mental efforts.

00:07:50.898 --> 00:07:53.698
Everything [Everyone] will sit down.
“All right, let us discuss realization!”

00:07:53.899 --> 00:07:57.038
What are you going to discuss?

00:07:58.621 --> 00:08:01.651
What are you going to discuss
about realization?

00:08:01.852 --> 00:08:05.708
Did you get your realization by discussion?

00:08:06.145 --> 00:08:10.750
You have to meditate! You have to go
within yourselves.

00:08:10.951 --> 00:08:14.005
See your growth, work out within!

00:08:14.213 --> 00:08:16.578
You cannot talk about it, you cannot
discuss it,

00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:20.915
you cannot argue about it – it is within!

00:08:21.116 --> 00:08:24.600
Because of these ramblings, we go up
to the shakti point.

00:08:24.801 --> 00:08:27.529
But Shambhu’s we do not reach.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.845
But in the East where people are
not that much intelligent,

00:08:31.046 --> 00:08:36.513
that well-educated and sophisticated,
I would say -

00:08:36.714 --> 00:08:42.865
simple people, it goes just there.
And they just enjoy.

00:08:43.066 --> 00:08:45.493
If you show them any book, written
about Sahaja Yoga –

00:08:45.694 --> 00:08:47.559
for example Gregoire’s book - they’ll say,

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.856
“Mother, we don’t want it, to read,
we don’t understand this”.

00:08:52.057 --> 00:08:54.268
They are just there! They are now there. 
What is there now?

00:08:54.469 --> 00:08:57.911
It’s flowing through our body, everything
we know it’s there.

00:08:58.112 --> 00:09:02.136
Why should we bother about these things
and all the controversies and dogmas,

00:09:02.337 --> 00:09:05.537
and what all the Churches have told you,
and why they have failed

00:09:05.738 --> 00:09:10.267
and why this religion has failed?
Who is bothered?!

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.223
So these problems come up.

00:09:13.424 --> 00:09:18.841
Because their attention has been
on the Spirit alone.

00:09:19.435 --> 00:09:23.695
Simple people have that capacity.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:27.300
So now forgetting everything else,
all your intelligence,

00:09:27.501 --> 00:09:32.706
all your books and education and all
that you have had – forget it.

00:09:32.907 --> 00:09:35.649
And just put your attention to your heart,

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:40.874
where lies the connection with
God Almighty.

00:09:41.075 --> 00:09:43.473
If your attention is there,

00:09:43.674 --> 00:09:49.720
you will be surprised that your attention
will be stabilised.

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:56.996
Not only that it will be stabilised,
but the source of joy is that

00:09:57.197 --> 00:10:00.868
and you will start feeling that joy.

00:10:01.493 --> 00:10:04.332
(...) But if you want to co-operate
and help yourself,

00:10:04.533 --> 00:10:08.154
then you have to put your attention
in such a way

00:10:08.355 --> 00:10:14.583
that – every problem comes in – you go
to your heart, not to your brain.

00:10:14.784 --> 00:10:17.084
Any question comes in, go to your heart.

00:10:17.292 --> 00:10:22.233
There resides the blessings of God. And you 
will be surprised how it will be solved.

00:10:22.433 --> 00:10:25.027
That’s why I said “Go into thoughtless
awareness.”

00:10:25.228 --> 00:10:29.953
That is the quality of heart, because 
heart doesn’t think.

00:10:31.219 --> 00:10:36.984
You go to your heart, means you put
your attention to your Spirit.

00:10:37.185 --> 00:10:39.660
(...) You Sahaja Yogis have to be people

00:10:39.861 --> 00:10:47.088
of higher outward manifestation. 
Inside you are,

00:10:47.289 --> 00:10:51.231
but outward manifestation has to be higher.

00:10:51.432 --> 00:10:57.945
You have to be humbler people, kinder
people, sweeter people,

00:10:58.146 --> 00:11:02.462
loving people, compassionate, understanding

00:11:02.663 --> 00:11:11.125
that you were there, where they are today;
joyous people and cheerful people.

00:11:11.326 --> 00:11:14.081
Otherwise nobody is going to believe
what is happening

00:11:14.282 --> 00:11:16.810
in the Kundalini inside, because whatever
is happening

00:11:17.011 --> 00:11:20.133
is happening, you cannot see that.

00:11:20.334 --> 00:11:23.632
It is important that it should be evident
on your face,

00:11:23.833 --> 00:11:28.871
in your behaviour, in everything. For that
you have to understand

00:11:29.072 --> 00:11:35.638
that you have to stabilise your attention
at the lotus feet of God.

00:11:35.839 --> 00:11:38.244
This is called as ‘Sharanagati’ –
surrendering.

00:11:38.445 --> 00:11:45.901
By surrendering, by worshipping,
by bhakti, by singing songs,

00:11:46.102 --> 00:11:52.566
by absolutely settling yourself
at the lotus feet of God Almighty.

00:11:52.767 --> 00:11:55.264
That’s the only way you are going
to achieve it.

00:11:55.465 --> 00:12:00.735
After realization only, you have the entry
into the Kingdom of God.

00:12:00.936 --> 00:12:03.671
Before that, whatever you try
has no meaning.

00:12:03.872 --> 00:12:08.406
Muslims do all the Namaz, morning till
evening – do not get anything!

00:12:08.607 --> 00:12:10.532
But we had some Muslims, you know that.

00:12:10.733 --> 00:12:13.215
Once he started after realization, he said,

00:12:13.416 --> 00:12:16.028
“Every time I bend I get vibrations.
Every time I say

00:12:16.229 --> 00:12:20.028
Allah’s name I get vibration.” It has 
happened with all of them.

00:12:20.229 --> 00:12:26.710
Because God exists, He is there,
it’s a fact.

00:12:26.911 --> 00:12:31.926
And the time has come for all of us
to feel Him and know Him.

00:12:32.512 --> 00:12:36.403
(...) Please put your attention 
to your heart.

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:41.424
(...) Yogini: Mother, when you said
‘Put your attention on your heart’

00:12:41.625 --> 00:12:45.457
do you mean the heart chakra? ”
Shri Mataji: You cannot feel heart.

00:12:45.658 --> 00:12:47.824
You cannot know heart chakra, nothing!

00:12:48.025 --> 00:12:51.961
When I say that, just say that,
‘I’m putting My attention to My Spirit’,

00:12:52.162 --> 00:12:55.424
that’s all. Your saying is a mantra itself.

00:12:55.625 --> 00:12:58.282
You know now you are a realised soul.

00:12:58.483 --> 00:13:02.343
You are an enlightened person,
your desire is enlightened.

00:13:02.548 --> 00:13:08.137
And if you just say that ‘My attention
is on my Spirit in my heart,

00:13:08.338 --> 00:13:11.738
in the organ of heart…’

00:13:17.845 --> 00:13:22.205
You see now, whatever you say
has a meaning.

00:13:22.784 --> 00:13:28.066
Do you understand? Whatever you say
is enlightened now, there’s a light in it.

00:13:28.267 --> 00:13:31.539
Only thing is, if your attention is not
all right still,

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:39.134
then the light is still dim. If in the dim
light, you see half things, but you do see.

00:13:40.046 --> 00:13:42.903
But if it is a bright light you can see it
very clearly.

00:13:43.104 --> 00:13:49.779
So to brighten up the light, you just say 
that, “Let me be in my heart.”

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:53.929
It works out, settles down, you see?

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.631
As if you order your attention to be there.

00:13:56.832 --> 00:14:00.560
It just goes like a, like a sweet little
baby, you see.

00:14:00.761 --> 00:14:03.459
Sits down there, “All right, Mother,
