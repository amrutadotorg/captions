WEBVTT

00:05.047 --> 00:10.460
“First of all, put your attention
to your heart and to your Spirit”

00:17.809 --> 00:22.458
(...) God does look after all of us.

00:22.660 --> 00:25.445
He is compassion, He is love,
He has created us,

00:25.622 --> 00:29.020
He has made a beautiful
human being out of us,

00:29.221 --> 00:31.105
within us He has placed
all these centres,

00:31.306 --> 00:34.450
He has placed the Kundalini within us,
and the Kundalini has to rise,

00:34.651 --> 00:38.754
you have to get realization,
all that is so, no doubt.

00:38.955 --> 00:43.653
All this has to work out. That’s also
the truth is.

00:43.854 --> 00:50.184
But still, one must know that He is not
in your hand,

00:50.471 --> 00:53.256
you are in His hand.

00:53.457 --> 00:58.087
There are many people who pray to God:
“Give me promotion.

00:58.288 --> 01:01.683
O God, you have to give me promotion”.

01:01.884 --> 01:06.720
And then if He doesn’t give, “This God
is not helpful to me!

01:06.899 --> 01:12.383
Why has He not given me promotion?”
You should not cheapen God like that.

01:12.584 --> 01:17.656
God is the one Who is Almighty,
Who has created all this Universe.

01:17.857 --> 01:22.464
He has created you, and He has created
you for a purpose.

01:22.665 --> 01:28.661
And that purpose is something Supreme.
That’s not ordinary purpose,

01:28.862 --> 01:33.167
the way you think Him to be, He is not
an ordinary person.

01:33.368 --> 01:37.163
He is Supreme and He will give you
something that is Supreme.

01:37.364 --> 01:44.910
Supposing you go to see some king,
he will not give you 1p, will he?

01:46.134 --> 01:49.025
He may give you a diamond.

01:49.226 --> 01:56.507
But if you want to ask anything from God
then you must ask for the Supreme!

01:56.708 --> 02:03.508
And what is the Supreme? The Supreme
is to know Him.

02:03.693 --> 02:08.829
Unless and until you know your Self,
you are not going to know Him.

02:09.482 --> 02:15.338
He has placed within you that instrument
by which you first know your Self.

02:15.539 --> 02:20.757
Once you know your Self, through your Self
you know Him.

02:21.529 --> 02:26.945
But the first important thing is that
your attention has to be on Him.

02:27.146 --> 02:31.794
There’s a very different thing to have
attention on God

02:31.995 --> 02:34.639
and to have a blind faith in God.

02:34.840 --> 02:40.271
These two things are absolutely
far apart.

02:40.472 --> 02:44.073
To have faith in God means – I’ve already
told you

02:44.275 --> 02:48.847
all the silly things we do in the name
of faith.

02:49.035 --> 02:53.440
But to have your attention on God is

02:53.641 --> 02:58.304
to ask: “When am I going to be my Self?

02:58.505 --> 03:04.040
When are You going to accept me
as a citizen of Your Kingdom?

03:04.241 --> 03:07.934
When are You going to use me
as Your instrument, O Lord?”

03:08.135 --> 03:11.624
This should be your attention.
If your attention is like that,

03:11.825 --> 03:16.277
and if you are really of pure nature
about it,

03:16.478 --> 03:19.411
it will work out, it works out.

03:19.612 --> 03:22.139
This is the only thing that is needed
in Sahaja Yoga,

03:22.340 --> 03:28.059
is a clean heart to ask for it,
to desire for it.

03:28.979 --> 03:31.284
(...) But today, we have to understand
one thing:

03:31.485 --> 03:36.948
that the essences within us – for example
innocence – is absolutely pure.

03:37.111 --> 03:43.172
Within us it is absolutely pure. In its own
form it is absolutely pure.

03:43.373 --> 03:49.787
But, when it is reflected through
our medium, it gets soiled.

03:50.241 --> 03:54.594
The way you are, the way you express it,
it gets spoiled.

03:54.795 --> 03:59.829
If you are a cunning person, the innocence
cannot be manifested,

04:00.030 --> 04:04.648
it cannot be manifested. Your innocence,
whatever God has placed within you

04:04.849 --> 04:09.329
is completely darkened because you
cannot reflect it back.

04:09.530 --> 04:14.993
There is no manifestation about it.
Why it happens?

04:15.194 --> 04:21.092
If you are pure, if you are all right,
the innocence is all right,

04:21.293 --> 04:24.376
then why it is not manifested through you?

04:24.577 --> 04:28.774
Why this cunningness can stop that
innocence or any other essences

04:28.975 --> 04:33.578
that are within you, which you know
which exist on different chakras?

04:33.753 --> 04:40.101
We must think about it, why it happens.
That even after realization,

04:40.302 --> 04:44.245
we cannot properly manifest our innocence,

04:44.446 --> 04:49.610
our primordial powers

04:49.811 --> 04:52.990
which are within us in absolute
purest form.

04:53.191 --> 05:00.252
Why? What happens within us?
The trouble is with our attention.

05:00.460 --> 05:04.210
When you became human beings,
you were given full freedom

05:04.411 --> 05:08.413
to put your attention onto anything
you wanted.

05:08.621 --> 05:15.351
Say, if you want, you can put your
attention onto any subject.

05:15.552 --> 05:19.584
Say I receive a telephone call.
So I put my attention to it.

05:19.785 --> 05:22.188
Now, I can go on identifying with it,
thinking about it;

05:22.389 --> 05:25.333
all my attention will be enveloped
and I will not pay attention

05:25.534 --> 05:29.261
to anything else that is happening.

05:30.572 --> 05:33.946
The attention is so mobile, it has no base

05:34.147 --> 05:38.371
as if the whole thing, like a jelly,
goes and gets attached to a thing.

05:39.024 --> 05:42.356
(...) I mean if you waste your attention
on foolish nonsensical things,

05:42.557 --> 05:45.685
what’s going to happen?

05:46.552 --> 05:49.094
So this is how we put our attention

05:49.295 --> 05:56.575
onto absolutely useless things; sometimes
onto very depraved things also.

05:56.763 --> 05:59.276
We may put our attention to anything

05:59.477 --> 06:07.488
that we think “requires our attention”.
But do you have your self-esteem?

06:07.689 --> 06:12.206
If you have, then where should be
your attention?

06:12.407 --> 06:17.779
It should be on your Self. Where is
your Self now?

06:17.980 --> 06:25.604
It is God Almighty. Is a part of that
Great Primordial Being.

06:25.805 --> 06:30.838
Your attention should be on That.

06:31.039 --> 06:36.343
After realization, your attention
should be in your heart,

06:36.561 --> 06:42.467
on your Spirit, which is the part
of God Almighty.

06:42.687 --> 06:49.808
If your attention is on your Spirit, you’ll
be amazed, how your attention will act.

06:50.009 --> 06:52.903
You see, like a jelly which is attached
to a point.

06:53.104 --> 06:56.044
It may little bit get disturbed, again
it will settle down.

06:56.253 --> 06:58.619
Again, it will get little bit disturbed,
it will settle down.

06:58.820 --> 07:04.628
It will not hang on to any point,
and will not bother you.

07:04.950 --> 07:08.239
So to put all your essences properly,
first of all,

07:08.440 --> 07:13.142
put your attention to your heart
and to your Spirit,

07:13.343 --> 07:16.905
because that’s your absolute point
which you have discovered.

07:17.106 --> 07:19.321
But it doesn’t happen with many people.

07:19.522 --> 07:24.809
The trouble is, when Kundalini rises,
She gives two kinds of experiences.

07:25.010 --> 07:28.721
One is called as Shambhavi, another
called as Shakti.

07:28.922 --> 07:36.308
Shambhavi is the feeling of the Shambhu, is
the Shiva in the heart, means God Almighty.

07:36.509 --> 07:39.038
But the other is Shakti.

07:39.239 --> 07:44.102
Now with western people it is the other,
because you know your problems.

07:44.303 --> 07:50.697
You have used your powers for all kinds
of ramblings in your mental efforts.

07:50.898 --> 07:53.698
Everything [Everyone] will sit down.
“All right, let us discuss realization!”

07:53.899 --> 07:57.038
What are you going to discuss?

07:58.621 --> 08:01.651
What are you going to discuss
about realization?

08:01.852 --> 08:05.708
Did you get your realization by discussion?

08:06.145 --> 08:10.750
You have to meditate! You have to go
within yourselves.

08:10.951 --> 08:14.005
See your growth, work out within!

08:14.213 --> 08:16.578
You cannot talk about it, you cannot
discuss it,

08:16.779 --> 08:20.915
you cannot argue about it – it is within!

08:21.116 --> 08:24.600
Because of these ramblings, we go up
to the shakti point.

08:24.801 --> 08:27.529
But Shambhu’s we do not reach.

08:27.730 --> 08:30.845
But in the East where people are
not that much intelligent,

08:31.046 --> 08:36.513
that well-educated and sophisticated,
I would say -

08:36.714 --> 08:42.865
simple people, it goes just there.
And they just enjoy.

08:43.066 --> 08:45.493
If you show them any book, written
about Sahaja Yoga –

08:45.694 --> 08:47.559
for example Gregoire’s book - they’ll say,

08:47.760 --> 08:51.856
“Mother, we don’t want it, to read,
we don’t understand this”.

08:52.057 --> 08:54.268
They are just there! They are now there.
What is there now?

08:54.469 --> 08:57.911
It’s flowing through our body, everything
we know it’s there.

08:58.112 --> 09:02.136
Why should we bother about these things
and all the controversies and dogmas,

09:02.337 --> 09:05.537
and what all the Churches have told you,
and why they have failed

09:05.738 --> 09:10.267
and why this religion has failed?
Who is bothered?!

09:10.880 --> 09:13.223
So these problems come up.

09:13.424 --> 09:18.841
Because their attention has been
on the Spirit alone.

09:19.435 --> 09:23.695
Simple people have that capacity.

09:23.910 --> 09:27.300
So now forgetting everything else,
all your intelligence,

09:27.501 --> 09:32.706
all your books and education and all
that you have had – forget it.

09:32.907 --> 09:35.649
And just put your attention to your heart,

09:35.850 --> 09:40.874
where lies the connection with
God Almighty.

09:41.075 --> 09:43.473
If your attention is there,

09:43.674 --> 09:49.720
you will be surprised that your attention
will be stabilised.

09:49.923 --> 09:56.996
Not only that it will be stabilised,
but the source of joy is that

09:57.197 --> 10:00.868
and you will start feeling that joy.

10:01.493 --> 10:04.332
(...) But if you want to co-operate
and help yourself,

10:04.533 --> 10:08.154
then you have to put your attention
in such a way

10:08.355 --> 10:14.583
that – every problem comes in – you go
to your heart, not to your brain.

10:14.784 --> 10:17.084
Any question comes in, go to your heart.

10:17.292 --> 10:22.233
There resides the blessings of God. And you
will be surprised how it will be solved.

10:22.433 --> 10:25.027
That’s why I said “Go into thoughtless
awareness.”

10:25.228 --> 10:29.953
That is the quality of heart, because
heart doesn’t think.

10:31.219 --> 10:36.984
You go to your heart, means you put
your attention to your Spirit.

10:37.185 --> 10:39.660
(...) You Sahaja Yogis have to be people

10:39.861 --> 10:47.088
of higher outward manifestation.
Inside you are,

10:47.289 --> 10:51.231
but outward manifestation has to be higher.

10:51.432 --> 10:57.945
You have to be humbler people, kinder
people, sweeter people,

10:58.146 --> 11:02.462
loving people, compassionate, understanding

11:02.663 --> 11:11.125
that you were there, where they are today;
joyous people and cheerful people.

11:11.326 --> 11:14.081
Otherwise nobody is going to believe
what is happening

11:14.282 --> 11:16.810
in the Kundalini inside, because whatever
is happening

11:17.011 --> 11:20.133
is happening, you cannot see that.

11:20.334 --> 11:23.632
It is important that it should be evident
on your face,

11:23.833 --> 11:28.871
in your behaviour, in everything. For that
you have to understand

11:29.072 --> 11:35.638
that you have to stabilise your attention
at the lotus feet of God.

11:35.839 --> 11:38.244
This is called as ‘Sharanagati’ –
surrendering.

11:38.445 --> 11:45.901
By surrendering, by worshipping,
by bhakti, by singing songs,

11:46.102 --> 11:52.566
by absolutely settling yourself
at the lotus feet of God Almighty.

11:52.767 --> 11:55.264
That’s the only way you are going
to achieve it.

11:55.465 --> 12:00.735
After realization only, you have the entry
into the Kingdom of God.

12:00.936 --> 12:03.671
Before that, whatever you try
has no meaning.

12:03.872 --> 12:08.406
Muslims do all the Namaz, morning till
evening – do not get anything!

12:08.607 --> 12:10.532
But we had some Muslims, you know that.

12:10.733 --> 12:13.215
Once he started after realization, he said,

12:13.416 --> 12:16.028
“Every time I bend I get vibrations.
Every time I say

12:16.229 --> 12:20.028
Allah’s name I get vibration.” It has
happened with all of them.

12:20.229 --> 12:26.710
Because God exists, He is there,
it’s a fact.

12:26.911 --> 12:31.926
And the time has come for all of us
to feel Him and know Him.

12:32.512 --> 12:36.403
(...) Please put your attention
to your heart.

12:38.230 --> 12:41.424
(...) Yogini: Mother, when you said
‘Put your attention on your heart’

12:41.625 --> 12:45.457
do you mean the heart chakra? ”
Shri Mataji: You cannot feel heart.

12:45.658 --> 12:47.824
You cannot know heart chakra, nothing!

12:48.025 --> 12:51.961
When I say that, just say that,
‘I’m putting My attention to My Spirit’,

12:52.162 --> 12:55.424
that’s all. Your saying is a mantra itself.

12:55.625 --> 12:58.282
You know now you are a realised soul.

12:58.483 --> 13:02.343
You are an enlightened person,
your desire is enlightened.

13:02.548 --> 13:08.137
And if you just say that ‘My attention
is on my Spirit in my heart,

13:08.338 --> 13:11.738
in the organ of heart…’

13:17.845 --> 13:22.205
You see now, whatever you say
has a meaning.

13:22.784 --> 13:28.066
Do you understand? Whatever you say
is enlightened now, there’s a light in it.

13:28.267 --> 13:31.539
Only thing is, if your attention is not
all right still,

13:31.740 --> 13:39.134
then the light is still dim. If in the dim
light, you see half things, but you do see.

13:40.046 --> 13:42.903
But if it is a bright light you can see it
very clearly.

13:43.104 --> 13:49.779
So to brighten up the light, you just say
that, “Let me be in my heart.”

13:49.980 --> 13:53.929
It works out, settles down, you see?

13:54.130 --> 13:56.631
As if you order your attention to be there.

13:56.832 --> 14:00.560
It just goes like a, like a sweet little
baby, you see.

14:00.761 --> 14:03.459
Sits down there, “All right, Mother,
whatever you say.”

14:03.660 --> 14:07.038
Just say like that. Just try to feel
your powers.

14:07.239 --> 14:11.238
What you say, how it works out.

14:11.737 --> 14:16.801
Even when you say mantras, these mantras are also enlightened.
