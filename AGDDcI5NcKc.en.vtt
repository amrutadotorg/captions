In the sacrum bone at the base of the spine of every human being.

00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:23.623
There is a dormant spiritual energy known in Sanskrit as Kundalini.

00:00:24.046 --> 00:00:33.312
When awakened it rises through vital energy centres along the spinal cord called chakras.

00:00:37.965 --> 00:00:41.513
As the Kundalini passes through the fontanel area

00:00:41.513 --> 00:00:47.520
we can feel a cool breeze above our heads and in the palms of our hands.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:55.546
As we enter a state of thoughtless awareness, peace and oneness known as Self-Realization.
