00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.880
So today is a very, very important day, you know that;

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.800
because in the history of creation,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.920
till the time of Christ, in the human awareness,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.320
only the sense of resurrection was created

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.200
– that you can be resurrected or you can be reborn.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.040
That sense came down with them. People recognised it, that

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.560
it could happen to all of us, sometime.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.560
But it did not happen.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.560
Actualisation never took place. That was a problem.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.640
And without you entering into the Reality,

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:08.040
whatever one may talk about, it sounds imaginative.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.640
So, one has to jump into the Reality,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.400
into the truth.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.320
This never had happened before

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.520
and, as I have told you that, if it had happened to one or two people

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.040
it makes no difference at all, to the masses,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.080
and nobody accepts it.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.720
And like the small little river flowing in the desert

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.080
it disappears in the thin air.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.200
The truth also, whatever was found out,

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.320
never had any roots.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.880
And all kinds of funny things started with this reality,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.800
which these people preached.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:58.640
So it was to be the culmination of human consciousness,

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.720
where he becomes one with the Divine.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.080
That he becomes one with himself.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.880
It was to happen.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:17.240
And that too was to happen at the time,

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.600
which was most opportune, the best time.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.040
Because, unless and until the human desire is very strong,

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:40.680
the human will is very strong and is asking for the Reality,

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.280
the Reality does not go into action.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.120
Other things, of course, as far as the creation is concerned,

00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:01.240
creating the animals and all the trees and the fruits and flowers,

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.280
all these things are done.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.760
But the human evolution could not have matured earlier

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.200
because there was not so much of seeking.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.600
So when the time came,

00:03:22.167 --> 00:03:24.453
when the necessity was so great

00:03:24.533 --> 00:03:27.887
that the necessity itself brought forth Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.120
And it happened that I really saw the Sahastrara.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.080
Of course, you know there’s a difference
between your Sahastrara and mine.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.144
And I saw the Sahastrara, which is the Great Sahastrara,

00:03:49.224 --> 00:03:53.120
opening out beautifully.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:04:04.200
And the petals were just like flames,

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.680
rounded flames; not like flames but rounded ones:

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.760
rounded, beautifully coloured flames, of different colours.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.400
That’s why I wore today a blouse of
many colours and a sari of many colours.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:28.203
Because I saw so many permutations and combinations of these.

00:04:28.283 --> 00:04:33.000
It opened out so beautifully.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.280
And as if every petal was individually,

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.280
absolutely complete and perfect, but so integrated at the base.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.520
And the way it opened out, and the
movement, was so rhythmic and so harmonious.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.560
There was no problem. Such a harmony was between them;

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.880
no fluctuation anywhere.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.480
As if they were dancing to the tune, they opened out.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.800
And the colours, all spread out their light around the aura.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:14.120
And in the centre I saw the Agnya
(inaudible), or you can say the Sun colour,

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.120
and all the chakras from there also emitting light.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.400
But the chakras were darker in shades and they were emitting.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.080
So dark that they were all looking blackish, so dark.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.640
Sort of a condensed colour they had.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.440
And they were also emitting light all over.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.880
And the light, as soon as the whole thing
opened out, the light absolutely spread out,

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:50.040
and then I said “It’s done,” it can be done.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.986
So, first I had to open out my Sahastrara itself,

00:05:55.066 --> 00:06:01.000
then your Sahastraras could be opened out.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:08.400
And then I felt that, a tremendous flow of my grace,

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:16.600
started flowing. So much grace, even upon me.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.840
Like torrential rain on me.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.440
Absolutely I was so drenched in that
joy. Really I was lost, absolutely lost.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:45.400
I felt that the whole Creation is now
resounding with that Universal Consciousness.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.120
Just like that.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:54.400
Everything was finished. Only the joy was permeating.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.840
It was such a beautiful time.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.720
And then I started my work.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:08.200
But as you know, in the beginning, it’s
very difficult to talk about these things.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:15.320
To begin with it is very difficult for a
person to say that “I am such and such.”

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.520
It’s a really embarrassing stuff. It’s
extremely embarrassing to tell someone.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.240
I mean if you have some power, or
something you feel shy to talk about that.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.040
You just don’t want to stand out and be singled out.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:34.760
You feel so lonely about it and you
don’t want to mention it to anyone.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.640
I managed it for quite some time.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.920
But when the Sahastrara opened out,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.720
I knew that I will have to come out in my true colours.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:51.360
Of course, not yet, I have not yet come out
because that would be terrible. But, as it is,

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:58.640
when the Sahastrara opened out I
realised that the instrument is now operative.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.120
So this Instrument that is before

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:12.760
you is the Instrument by which you are going to know the truth.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:17.320
You can find out the truth now, through this Instrument of mine.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.920
Because through this Instrument you will get your Kundalini awakened,

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.360
you’ll get your Realisation.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.240
And through your vibrations you will be able

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.240
to know the Truth.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:40.640
You already know that the rapport
between you and the Truth has started.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:45.400
You can ask any question and you get the answer.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:57.200
So, first of all the Truth will be known,

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.880
and that Truth, once you know,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.120
will be followed by another dimension of that Truth

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.080
and another dimension. And I knew a stage will be reached

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:15.360
where I will have to give the whole of it.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.760
And the whole of it you have got it.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.960
But this Instrument has a special thing about it,

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:30.840
because Sahastrara is, the essence of Sahastrara,

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:36.000
is integration, is ekagrata.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.840
I have told you what is ekagrata:

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:48.600
that is all the holes of all the needles if you put together

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:54.640
and thread them together that is called as ‘ekagra’.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.520
‘Agra’ means ‘the end’, ‘ek’ means ‘one’.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.400
All the ends are put through one string.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.640
Now what does this means?

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.640
In a very subtle way if we understand

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.960
that all the chakras are threaded into my Being.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.960
That means all types of patterns that have been created,

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:32.047
all types of religions, all types of faiths,

00:10:32.127 --> 00:10:35.880
all types of ideas, all types of enterprises,

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.880
science, yogas, everything!

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.400
All of them are threaded in this Being.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.660
So supposing you are a hatha yogi,

00:10:50.746 --> 00:11:00.139
then you have to just ask question, “Mother, are you hatha yoga?”

00:11:00.219 --> 00:11:02.246
finished.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:11.240
If you are doing Raja Yoga, you just ask, “Mother, are you Raja Yoga?”

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:16.800
If you are a Christian, just ask, “Mother, are you Christ?”

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:25.360
If you are a Muslim you just ask, “Mother, are you the Prophet?”

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:31.240
Even if you are people who do not believe in God,

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.280
[you] say, “Are You the Abstract Image?

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:41.360
Are You Buddha? Are You Mahavira?” All of them are with me.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:46.480
So that all of you, wherever you may
be, whatever you might have developed,

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:52.560
nothing is wasted, but is given a proper meaning.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:57.840
But with that meaning you will be integrated with others also.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.480
Because there’s One Personality, which has all these within.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.760
Like one thousand names of one Goddess.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.560
So automatically they will be integrated.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.560
You can be a Hindu, you can be a Muslim, you can be a Christian,

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.840
if you want to call yourself something like that.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:21.680
But once you become a Sahaja Yogi you are all integrated.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.760
You can go to Church, if you want to,

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.120
you can go to a Mosque if you want to,

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.480
but you know who is the person who is there.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.520
Do you follow that point?

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.680
This is the essence of Sahastrara.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.880
And for that reason we have to give up our misidentifications.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.567
Like if you say, “I am a Christian,

00:12:45.648 --> 00:12:48.560
” then how are you a Christian? “I am Church of England,”

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:52.200
that’s not the way to understand.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:58.040
You are a Christian, alright, then you are following Christ,

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.800
because I am Christ.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:07.360
If everybody is following one lamppost,

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.960
you can say, then they are all integrating.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:16.120
You may seek from one angle another may seek from another angle,

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.840
but by this integration you will realise

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.920
that the Light is the same.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:29.640
So all these years, the way people have been fighting and quarrelling,

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.440
all that is going to be absolutely neutralised.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.120
This is the beauty of integration.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.080
Anywhere in the world,

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.240
whatever they are following can be answered.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:47.280
But supposing its some sort of a falsehood thing like voodoo,

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:51.000
then I am not that. Of course not.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.520
I am not falsehood.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.720
Whatever is the Truth,

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.920
whatever you have followed something

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.080
which is called as ‘truth’ – which is called, also.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:07.280
In the sense, like Christianity is not Truth,

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.320
Christ is the Truth.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.920
But if you are a Christian and followed Christ

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:18.600
in a false way, because following pope is not following Christ at all.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:23.080
Or say, becoming a Church of
England, this thing is not following Christ.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.800
But, if you have been following Christ even through Church of England,

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:33.120
it’s alright. Even through pope it’s alright.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.680
Because now you have found out the Truth.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:48.720
So this was a very important and a
crucial day I would say, the 5th of May.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:53.160
And it all happened very dramatically, extremely dramatically,

00:14:53.280 --> 00:15:03.360
that I went to a programme, not a programme, but

00:15:03.812 --> 00:15:09.561
I went to find out about one of the horrid rakshasas’ places,

00:15:09.641 --> 00:15:13.067
to see what sort of a thing he was about to.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:19.800
And of course I had made my own
arrangements and I stayed in a friend’s place.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:24.640
But I went to the camp to see what he was doing, what was he up to;

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:30.840
in a very simple innocent way, he could never
have guessed that I was up to some mischief!

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:34.520
Extremely simple and innocent.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.720
I look so innocent don’t take me for that.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:43.920
I am very clever! So I went down

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.840
and the fellow thought me to be a
great disciple of his and all that. (laughing)

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.600
Then I went to the seashore

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.680
and I saw what he was up to, I was so angry,

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.805
I said, “Now, what is it?” I said, “I must hurry up.

00:15:59.886 --> 00:16:02.760
It has to be done now. It’s no more time needed.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.160
Because just see what is he up to!”

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:11.200
He was working on a chakra which is to be worshipped

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.160
and I felt that I must do something about it.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:21.680
And really it happened, that I could
just open out the Sahastrara. I said,

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:27.080
“That’s it!” Because as you must’ve
heard that Goddess has no [purpose].

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:31.240
She’s nishprayojana, She’s purposeless, She has no purpose at all.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.720
But, if the purpose comes in Her way,

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.400
then She may do something.

00:16:35.513 --> 00:16:37.772
But She doesn’t have Her own purpose.

00:16:37.853 --> 00:16:41.513
She’s absolutely purposeless, useless! Without any desire.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:46.080
Imagine! Without any attributes.

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.640
What a thing and a half, whatever it is!

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:55.560
Such a personality when It is faced with a
demand like that, comes up with it’s form.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:02.040
So now you understand from there that, on this Sahastrara day,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.560
you have to also demand.

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:13.240
I want you to demand and ask, because I have no desire.

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:19.040
And you just go ahead! You have all the rights to demand from me.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:26.440
And ask for the biggest and the highest
and the most fantastic and the most dynamic

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.080
that you want to do.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.320
Put up your minds and heads together,

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.880
and ask for something big.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.640
This is a very great day today. Go home, think about it.

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:44.760
Collectively also you decide. I’ll go now, so then you decide

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:50.680
and put a demand and it could be
done! Now, thy will be done, not mine.
