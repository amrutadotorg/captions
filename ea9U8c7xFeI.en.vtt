00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.700
Today we have decided to have the puja of
Shri Krishna.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:21.619
We have many a times done this puja and have
understood the essence of Shri Krishna’s

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.599
advent, which was six thousand years back.

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:44.600
And now, what His manifestation was, what
He wanted to be accomplished has to be done

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.910
in this Kali Yuga.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:01:00.590
As it is, this Kali Yuga is going into a new
realm of Satya Yuga, but in between there

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:13.279
is Krita Yuga where this Brahmachaitanya,
or we can say the all-pervading Power of God’s

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:16.400
love, is going to act.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:27.470
At this time, what is going to happen with
Shri Krishna’s powers – this is what we

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.900
have to see.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.919
Shri Krishna, as I told you, was the incarnation
also of diplomacy.

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:44.979
So He plays around quite a lot, and ultimately
He brings forth the untruth and the falsehood;

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.029
but in doing that He judges people.

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:55.379
So it’s very important that Shri Krishna’s
powers of His diplomacy were to be manifesting

00:01:55.379 --> 00:02:00.909
at this time, when it is the Last Judgment.

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:14.760
So now whatever we have done wrong before,
whatever karmas which have been done in ignorance

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:22.490
maybe, or maybe deliberately, all of them
will be paid back.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:30.710
Those punyas which you have done in previous
lives, this life, will be also rewarded.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:39.370
This is all done through Shri Krishna’s
principles of collectivity, where He collectively

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.640
sees the situation.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:54.850
For example, as I told you last time also
that Columbus luckily went to America; luckily,

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.670
so we were saved, otherwise we would not have
been here.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:09.110
And then these Spanish people, bullfighters,
they went and started fighting the poor, unarmed

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.480
people who were just very simple owners of
that land.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.370
But they went and occupied those lands, and
killed every one of them.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.780
So in America you can’t find anyone, no
doubt, but even in South America you have

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:34.190
to go to Colombia or to Bolivia, to great
heights, to see some aboriginals there; otherwise

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.740
most of them are finished.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.860
So now in Krita Yuga all these diseases have
started cropping up.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:50.930
But the best part is the drug addiction.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:04:00.500
These drugs are made, for your information,
in Bolivia and in Colombia.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:08.660
You drove them down there, so now you have
the drugs and very nicely you are very welcoming

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.390
them.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:21.810
People went in Nicaragua to help them and
brought back all these horrible drugs to Washington;

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.530
and in every elite society they are just discussing
which is the best drug, where is the sale

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.430
on and where should they buy the drugs.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.790
So the all of America is now worried how much
drug they can import, and kill themselves

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.360
and destroy themselves.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.520
So this destruction has started from inside.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:53.370
Then in addition to that, when I went there
first I told them not to indulge into these

00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:09.340
Freudian practices but keep to morality, otherwise
you’ll have problems.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:21.590
So they had first AIDS, secondly now yuppie’s
disease, and all kinds of secret diseases

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.170
they have.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:29.409
Among ten people there would be at least one
person who is suffering from that, and among

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:34.670
twenty people there’ll be at least one person
who must be suffering from schizophrenia.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:43.750
Because they made every person, every other
country nervous, so now they are getting schizophrenia.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:49.000
Like this we can see even in England.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:06:01.010
Now in England they came to India as traders,
ordinary traders, and plundered us completely,

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:07.170
no doubt, ruled us for three hundred years
– as I say, it’s gracious hospitality

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:14.870
they had – and then they left us in three
pieces.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.610
And now in their own country there are problems,
all kinds.

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:27.780
First of all nobody wants to call themselves
as English; they all call themselves Welsh

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.480
or Scots, or specially the Irish.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.140
And there is always a bomb scare in London,
every time, and for our first program also

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.909
there was a bomb scare.

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:46.080
So you can imagine these English who tried
to divide us are automatically divided among

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.530
themselves, and now fighting each other.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:54.960
But there are other problems also like AIDS
and immoral life, everything like that.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.290
Same with the French.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:04.590
French tried to sell their wine all over,
and bring their horrible bathroom culture

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:05.790
everywhere.

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.400
Now they are suffering from it.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:14.189
For example, most of the time they’re drunk
and they have lost all moorings, I mean, they

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:16.580
have no sense left in their heads.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:22.540
Like a housewife could be a prostitute – allowed
by law.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.390
All such things are happening.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:31.260
Now they are paying, and the worst that they
are paying, all these countries who think

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.800
no end of themselves, are recession.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:40.900
This is also Shri Krishna’s power, because
He’s Kubera.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.550
He’s the one who is the power of wealth.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:50.780
He gave lot of wealth to all these countries,
and now they don’t know what to do with

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:51.780
themselves.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:57.469
We can see in these fifty years how many things
have happened, but specially these twenty

00:07:57.469 --> 00:07:59.850
years have been really remarkable.

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:10.130
All over the world you can find out there
has been some sort of a complete change, or

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.400
an exposure.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:22.840
Even in Italy you see every day this Vatican
is here exposed, or some mafia connections

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:29.172
are there, or this what you call, people from
the government are exposed.

00:08:29.172 --> 00:08:37.040
I am doing nothing, I’m just sitting here,
but it is working out that way.

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:41.140
Since I have been here I don’t know how
many people have gone to jail, God knows.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:45.040
(I don’t know if she’s not brought My
throat pastilles.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:53.270
I had a bath early in the morning, so a little
bit … This is, Shri Krishna is trying to

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:57.650
fill Me up!)

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:15.160
We Indians are also suffering,because our
past deeds – like we had a caste system.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:19.540
So now the caste system has become the greatest
headache for us in India, that’s the greatest

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.640
cancer for us.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:31.690
Like that, everywhere these twenty years or
twenty-one years have been … ( … I don’t

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:36.480
know, because morning.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:53.170
Also reaction on Me … ) So like that in
every country, you’ll see gradually, every

00:09:53.170 --> 00:10:00.320
country will have to face for what it has
done.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:11.250
Also Shri Krishna’s own style was that He
can never believed in caste system.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:20.930
He Himself was born in a caste which is a,
what you call is a milkman’s caste, and

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:28.120
then He became a king, of course; but to begin
with, and He lived like an ordinary person.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:34.710
He used to take the cows outside, look after
them and bring them home.

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:44.320
Now if you see His life you’ll find He is
absolutely very human, the way He used to

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.850
tease His mother, tease other ladies.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:53.340
All this is extremely human and childlike,
and extremely sweet.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:57.359
But behind that also there was a great significance.

00:10:57.359 --> 00:11:05.560
For example, Shri Radha – as you know, She
was Mahalakshmi – and as Mahalakshmi She

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:12.470
used to put Her feet, take bath in the river
Yamuna, and the ladies would take water from

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:16.540
the same river, carry on their head the pitchers.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:23.680
Now Shri Krishna wanted to raise their kundalini,
so He used to hit them from the back so that

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:30.440
the water falls on their back, and that vibrated
water would raise their kundalini.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.630
This was His childish trick, but it had a
meaning.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:40.299
Another one, when we see Him in ras – “ra”
means energy.

00:11:40.299 --> 00:11:46.109
Radha: “ra” is “energy,” “dha”
means “the one who sustains it” – so

00:11:46.109 --> 00:11:49.990
it is Radhaji who had the energy.

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:57.490
“Sa” means “with,” so when they played
ras, was nothing but to play with the energy.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:02.970
And that’s how He wanted to have a collective
awakening of people, of gopa and gopis, and

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:04.390
He did it.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.700
But then He had to leave and fight this Kamsa.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:15.330
In His own lifetime, as a child or grown-up,
He punished all kinds of devils and women

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:19.770
devils who were like Putna, and all that.

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:25.010
He did it, and in this Kali Yuga also He’s
active.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:31.940
We have seen how gradually He has finished
so many false gurus, one by one; somebody

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:37.039
who called himself Shri Krishna, somebody
who called himself as God, something else,

00:12:37.039 --> 00:12:38.039
something else.

00:12:38.039 --> 00:12:42.979
He finished them all, exposed them nicely,
and now we have very few people in the arena

00:12:42.979 --> 00:12:46.900
left for us to fight.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.580
They themselves are trembling and they are
quite frightened of us, because we are standing

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:55.140
on truth.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:13:03.720
So now, when we have to think about Shri Krishna
who is residing in our Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:10.640
Many people have this problem of left Vishuddhi.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:18.950
That is because we are more sort of very social
people.

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:25.320
Now in the Western society, the social system
is so rigid that anybody can collapse with

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:31.940
that, or used to be; now better because of
the, maybe the revolt, anti-culture.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:38.669
But otherwise if you could put one spoon from
here to there, then you are finished.

00:13:38.669 --> 00:13:44.850
If you start your food with, say, not with
the fish knife but with an ordinary knife,

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:47.260
then you’re finished, you are no good.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:55.280
And these French have made even much worse
by using a big science out of alcohol.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:14:02.620
For this alcohol this is the glass, for that
alcohol that is the glass, and all that.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:06.590
So the whole collective was made so rigid.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:09.070
It’s much more rigid than in India.

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:14.820
I used to think Indian collective is quite
rigid because of certain conditionings we

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:26.330
have, but after coming to the West I was surprised
that it is such a conditioning in the heads

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:33.039
of the people, that some of the conditionings
you cannot remove – say from Catholic Church,

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:35.740
you might say, or from wherever it is.

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:44.241
But when it comes from somebody like Freud
who was absolutely a devil, they just give

00:14:44.241 --> 00:14:48.030
up all these conditionings and take to that.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:55.020
I cannot understand any country where there
is Catholic Church so predominant, they are

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.210
following Freud.

00:14:56.210 --> 00:15:05.900
So this collective rigidity, which was then
because maybe Shri Rama was a very formal

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:13.109
person, because of Him maybe the collective
rigidity might have been in India.

00:15:13.109 --> 00:15:19.410
But in the West it is all mental, it’s absolutely
mental.

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:25.160
If you make this kind of hair then you are
all right, if you put oil then you are absolutely

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:32.780
lunatic: all kinds of funny ideas were given,
and people started doing like this.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.210
If you don’t put oil at all you’ll become
bald.

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:38.430
If you become bald, then they will have a
business of their wigs.

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:44.320
So the whole thing was money-oriented, and
everything was made so fixed that you had

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.370
to do it so that they could sell their things.

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:52.530
England was, as you know, is tailcoat: you
have to wear a tailcoat if you have to see

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:53.530
the Queen.

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:59.120
I don’t know why you have to wear a tailcoat
to see the Queen, but it’s compulsory, and

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.030
if you don’t wear then you are not allowed.

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:06.871
So they have to borrow these tailcoats and
all that from one shop, which can be tight,

00:16:06.871 --> 00:16:13.650
which can be loose, and everybody looks like
Charlie Chaplin to Me!

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:17.080
They can’t walk straight.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:29.820
So this kind of stupid rigidity that came
into the West has really made them very nervous.

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.280
People are so nervous here.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:40.359
If you tell some lady that “I am going to
come and have food with you,” she will collapse.

00:16:40.359 --> 00:16:46.909
God knows what she thinks, I mean, it is caring
for the public opinion, or her own conditioning.

00:16:46.909 --> 00:16:53.380
But in an Indian, a housewife, if you tell
her you are going to come, she’ll be the

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:54.810
happiest person.

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:59.440
She’ll be very happy that you are coming
to her house for dinner.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.940
But here even if you say, “I would like
to come and see you in the evening,” they’ll

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.070
say, “All right, come in the pub.”

00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:13.520
Because they’re so nervous, they’re not
sure of themself; and this has come, I think,

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.060
perhaps from these norms that there have been
created in the West.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:26.020
In India also we had lots of these ritualism
that came up very serious.

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:34.590
Like we had people, Jainis who’d pick up
their hair with their hands.

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:46.110
They are not supposed to use any knives or
any scissors or any barbers, so they were

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:48.180
supposed to pick up their hair on their own.

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:53.590
So from their beard, from their this thing,
they would pick up all the time.

00:17:53.590 --> 00:18:00.970
That went to such a horrible conditioning
that they would say that if you, even if you

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:05.939
breathe then you can, you might consume some
animals.

00:18:05.939 --> 00:18:11.000
So they would put some sort of a cloth before
their mouth, and all kinds of nonsense they

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.410
did.

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:17.110
At that time Shri Krishna came in.

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:24.040
His own cousin was a tirthankara, you’ll
be surprised, Neminath.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:32.970
He became a tirthankara, and that made Shri
Krishna think about it, that this kind of

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:35.240
stupid ritualism that we have.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:40.830
Like in the morning women will get up, in
their sleep they will go, put some water for

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:45.000
tulsi, do this thing, that thing, throw water
here and there.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:51.060
And also the untouchables and touchables;
and you can’t take water from this, you

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:58.730
can’t eat this, you can’t move like that
– all kinds of restrictions, timing, everything.

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:02.730
This time is not good, that time is not good,
this you should not do, that you should not

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:13.990
do, to such an extent that the whole movement
of our country was round these rituals.

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:18.050
I had nephews who used to come to Bombay for
their work.

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:21.210
Every time they went to Lucknow, they would
come with shaven heads.

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:23.040
I said, “What’s the matter?”

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:26.670
He said, “There are many people in our family
who are old, and when they die we have to

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:27.670
shave our heads.”

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:32.730
So every time they went there somebody died,
so they came with shaven heads.

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:39.050
Like that such horrible rituals existed, and
even now in the South India there is a lot

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:43.910
of rituals are there, terrible rituals, and
they cannot get out of it, they’re frightened.

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:51.390
If they get out of it then they might be sinners,
or they will go to hell.

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:59.600
So the Indian conditioning was, as far as
these rigidities were concerned for religion,

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:07.780
to be on the right side in such a way that
we should not be caught up without doing this.

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:12.740
So early in the morning they’ll get up and
do the rituals, just without even thinking

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:17.340
about what they’re doing.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:23.690
But in the West the lifestyle is nothing but
rigidity, the whole lifestyle is; there’s

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:25.310
no freedom anywhere.

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:31.130
And all that then was rewarded by these hippies
and other people, and all of them, and they

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:35.310
fought it, and that thing went to another
extremes.

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:40.350
So from one extreme to another extreme they
went.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:46.710
Now, how Shri Krishna’s advent changed it.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:57.740
When Shri Krishna came on this Earth, He said
this is all a leela, it is just a play.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:02.730
Because you are involved into it, you cannot
see the play.

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:10.569
But if you ascend – if you are in the water
you are afraid of the water, but if you get

00:21:10.569 --> 00:21:17.810
into the boat you can see the water, and if
you know how to swim you can even save the

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:20.480
people who are in the water.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:29.370
So He says that if you develop a witness state,
sakshi swarupata, if you develop that state

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:32.870
then you see the whole thing as a drama.

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:34.900
Nothing affects you.

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:41.590
Nothing matters, you don’t worry about anything,
you see the problem above; you are, and you

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:45.510
see the problem, and because you are out of
it, you can solve the problem.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:54.860
This was His great advent, I would say, that
has taught the first step towards the ascent,

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:58.079
is that you have to become a sakshi.

00:21:58.079 --> 00:22:00.579
You have to become the witness.

00:22:00.579 --> 00:22:05.620
Now let’s see in Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:12.270
In Sahaja Yoga there are different types of
people come from different areas, from different

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:17.079
cultures, because the door is open to everyone.

00:22:17.079 --> 00:22:26.350
Now if an Indian comes in, he will be all
the time watchful about others, and will say

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:31.340
that “Mother, this man is not doing this,
this man is not doing that.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.530
He should have done footsoaking.”

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:40.809
He’ll find faults with others, all the time
saying that this man is not doing like this,

00:22:40.809 --> 00:22:42.550
and you know.

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:47.210
But in the West they start finding faults
with themselves.

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:53.660
And I receive letters, ten to twelve pages
sometimes, confessing what wrong they have

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:54.660
done.

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:59.740
Who is interested to know, what wrongs you
have done?

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:09.650
I mean, if a lotus is born, nobody wants to
know how many filthy things are inside the

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:10.650
pond.

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:13.860
You are now a lotus.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:20.990
But it’s so common that they think we must
confess, we must tell Mother what wrong we

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.990
have done.

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:25.380
Every moment you are changing, so what is
there to confess?

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:33.530
And the life is so formal, as I told you,
that people suffer from guilt for anything.

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:41.429
Apart from the influence of this Catholic
Church has conditioned you so much that even

00:23:41.429 --> 00:23:46.360
if you are not a Catholic, you’re a Protestant,
still you have guilt, and as a guilt you develop

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.900
this left Vishuddhi.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:56.420
So then this left Vishuddhi is Vishnumaya
– means what?

00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:03.890
Once you have this left Vishuddhi you develop
all the problems of the Vishnumaya, and one

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:07.150
of them is the heart.

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:15.770
Because Vishnumaya is an active thing, She
is like electricity; and if you have Vishnumaya

00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:19.130
problem, then you become lethargic.

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:21.770
“Oh, I’m so guilty.”

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:22.770
You become depressed.

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:26.740
That Vishnumaya Principle disappears from
you.

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:35.790
She’s the one who’s quick, fast, and She
gives the light, and announces to the whole

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:38.720
world what Shri Krishna is.

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:45.320
While what happens with such people, Sahaja
yogis who come in, who feel guilty, they say,

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:51.250
“Mother, You know, we thought that if we
do this then our ego will come up.

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:58.640
If we do any work outside and work in some
fields or in some villages, then our ego will

00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.640
come up.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.760
So we don’t want to do it.”

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.140
This is absurd.

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:09.850
It’s like you give light to some light,
and the light says that “I don’t want

00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:17.449
to give the light, because maybe this light
might develop an ego.”

00:25:17.449 --> 00:25:18.449
It is absurd.

00:25:18.449 --> 00:25:24.250
But such absurd things Sahaja yogis tell Me.

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:30.829
For them one has to understand, to get out
of this left Vishuddhi is to become absolutely

00:25:30.829 --> 00:25:37.710
dynamic in Sahaja Yoga, go all out into Sahaja
Yoga.

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:40.939
Otherwise they can’t get rid of their left
Vishuddhis.

00:25:40.939 --> 00:25:51.570
Left Vishuddhi is a thing that’s a very
depressive action on the whole being, and

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:58.890
a person who has left Vishuddhi is always
a very slow person to do anything for Sahaja

00:25:58.890 --> 00:25:59.890
Yoga.

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:02.460
You have not been given light to hide it.

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:08.790
Christ has said that you don’t put light
under the table.

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:15.660
So you have been given light to work it out,
to be dynamic, to think what to do, how to

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:17.780
arrange, how to organize.

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:23.210
But if you are guilty, then you will all the
time say, “Oh Mother, it’s very difficult,

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:29.390
You know, this . . .” Always you’ll find
the other side of the whole joke, just to

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:30.390
avoid.

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:33.740
Now for a Sahaja yogi is to witness himself,
first of all.

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.090
That is the introspection.

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:40.260
He should see for himself, “Where was I,
and I have come here.”

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:45.210
Don’t indulge too much in the past, but
see the distance you have crossed in such

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:47.620
a short time.

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:52.470
Now you have come into the Kingdom of God,
you have all the powers.

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:54.970
I don’t tell lies – it’s a fact.

00:26:54.970 --> 00:27:01.949
I’ll give you an example, if Wolfgang allows
Me to say that.

00:27:01.949 --> 00:27:13.189
Wolfgang was with Me when we were traveling
from Prague to Vienna and the plane, you see,

00:27:13.189 --> 00:27:16.699
he told Me that the plane is at ten-thirty,
but it was at nine-thirty; it was a mistake.

00:27:16.699 --> 00:27:21.170
It’s all right, there can be mistake, of
course, that also is Shri Krishna’s style.

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:25.069
You can always do mistakes, doesn’t matter.

00:27:25.069 --> 00:27:31.870
So we reached – I mean, why all these things
happen, see, to create an event, a ghatna.

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:37.660
So he was very upset about it that he told
Me a wrong time, and I reached there about

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:38.710
fifteen minutes late.

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:43.520
And there was a ground hostess, horrible,
she started shouting at Me, saying all kinds,

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:46.850
“It’s not fair, You don’t know,” this,
that and everything.

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:53.170
I just didn’t bother about it because I
knew that it was out of mistake we’ve done

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:54.170
it.

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:57.000
And they could have taken away their plane
instead of shouting, but they kept the plane

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:04.970
and shouted at Me, because she wanted to shout,
you see.

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:15.290
Then the plane was filled in with people and
it would not leave, so I asked the engineers.

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:17.309
They said, “It has been like this for the
half-an-hour.

00:28:17.309 --> 00:28:19.120
We are trying to correct it.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.380
It’s like this.”

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.070
So it’s all right.

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:29.750
He said that “We’ll have to wait till
we put it right.”

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:36.230
But because she shouted at Me, Wolfgang was
full of tears, you see; just look at this

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:38.929
German having so many tears in his eyes!

00:28:38.929 --> 00:28:42.880
Then Alga was telling him that “It’s all
right, doesn’t matter.

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.699
It’s not your mistake.”

00:28:44.699 --> 00:28:50.250
He was feeling so sad that Mother has been
insulted like this by this lady, because of

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:52.579
my mistake – I mean, it’s love.

00:28:52.579 --> 00:28:55.240
Now the power of his love was so great.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:29:00.299
At the same moment there were so many, to
about fifty people, Sahaja yogis standing

00:29:00.299 --> 00:29:02.040
on the balcony watching us.

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:10.250
We also felt and they also felt, but they
felt a tremendous cool breeze like a big blow

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:15.939
came to them and blew upon them vibrations,
and they just got enamored.

00:29:15.939 --> 00:29:20.370
And suddenly when they opened their eyes what
they find, the whole sky was filled with clouds.

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:22.650
There was not a single cloud.

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:27.689
In one second, in one second from where the
clouds came, God knows.

00:29:27.689 --> 00:29:30.069
It was all completely filled with them.

00:29:30.069 --> 00:29:34.319
Then they asked us to get out because they
could not do anything.

00:29:34.319 --> 00:29:37.490
So when we came back it started raining.

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:40.410
When we came in, he got after that lady.

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:42.670
He said, “Now, whom are we to shout?

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:45.360
We can’t catch our planes now.”

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:50.780
And then they announced that all the flights
are cancelled.

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:57.240
So see the power of his love for his Mother
that the whole sky couldn’t bear it, you

00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:00.449
see, the, his eyes became the sky.

00:30:00.449 --> 00:30:06.000
And in a second they said, “Mother, we have
never seen such a miracle, that there is not

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.050
one single thing and the whole thing was filled
with this.”

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:14.410
So you must know your powers.

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:18.429
That is what is – first of all witness yourself,
is the introspection.

00:30:18.429 --> 00:30:23.600
See for yourself how many powers you have
got.

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:29.340
Now with your left Vishuddhi you will always
conclude, “Oh, how can I have any powers?

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:33.710
After all, I have done this, I have done that.”

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:40.000
Even if you give somebody hundred pounds and
you tell him that now you go to the market,

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:46.120
buy something, he’ll say, “Oh, what’s
the use of this hundred pounds?” this, that.

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.569
Use it!

00:30:47.569 --> 00:30:49.170
As simple as that.

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:54.290
But then Sahaja yogis start saying that “No,
no, no, no.

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:55.970
Mother says, but how can I have?

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:58.860
How can I have these powers, after all?

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.140
It’s not possible.

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:01.429
I’m no good.”

00:31:01.429 --> 00:31:06.350
Because that left Vishuddhi’s all the time
telling that you are good for nothing.

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:16.280
It’s like a leaking hole in your brain that
takes away all the sense, and you accept it.

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:22.460
So first thing is to introspect yourself,
and see for yourself how many powers you have

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:23.460
got.

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:28.750
Like in the beginning no Sahaja yogi would
give realization, in India.

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:31.500
Nobody would even touch anyone.

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:37.470
It so happened that My car failed and I was
late two hours, luckily, and there was a big

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:40.829
meeting and they didn’t know what to do,
so they started giving realization to people.

00:31:40.829 --> 00:31:47.840
And then they realized they can give realization;
otherwise they would not touch anyone.

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:51.049
Now you know that what you can do.

00:31:51.049 --> 00:31:54.829
You also know that whatever you say happens.

00:31:54.829 --> 00:31:55.829
Whatever you want you can get it.

00:31:55.829 --> 00:31:56.829
Try, try, try!

00:31:56.829 --> 00:32:02.140
But if you don’t do it, then you’ll be
all the time half-baked.

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:07.929
Take the experience of your powers, see how
dynamic you are.

00:32:07.929 --> 00:32:13.420
Don’t have formalities about it, just use
it fully, and you will be amazed that you

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:16.179
have so many powers.

00:32:16.179 --> 00:32:19.070
Somebody told Me that “Mother, You have
given a siddhi to Guido.”

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:22.199
I have given siddhi to all of you.

00:32:22.199 --> 00:32:26.410
I never discriminate; but it’s only he is
very brave, he’s used it left and right.

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:28.809
He uses left and right.

00:32:28.809 --> 00:32:31.569
If you do not use your siddhis, what can I
do?

00:32:31.569 --> 00:32:37.470
I’ve given you all the siddhis, no doubt
about it, so try.

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:41.429
Like in the beginning Baba Mama told Me that
“How can I write a poem?

00:32:41.429 --> 00:32:46.260
I feel like writing but I am rather frightened,
because I could not even write an essay.”

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:52.710
I used to write essay for all My brothers,
you see, when they were studying.

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:56.189
I was very good at languages.

00:32:56.189 --> 00:32:58.189
But that’s what he said, and now look at
him!

00:32:58.189 --> 00:33:00.919
I told him, “You go ahead and write whatever
you write.”

00:33:00.919 --> 00:33:03.450
He said, “I may write something wrong.”

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:04.710
“It doesn’t matter.

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:05.710
Write it.”

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:10.630
In the same way, somebody wants to paint something,
one should not think how they will criticize

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:15.170
or anything – just paint.

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:16.390
If you want to sing, just sing.

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:21.270
If you want to do anything, any manifestation,
just do it boldly.

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:22.830
Go in a big way.

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:26.579
You’ll be amazed at yourself how you have
achieved it and how you are doing it.

00:33:26.579 --> 00:33:30.000
It has worked with so many artists, you know
that.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.610
That day Debu told you about himself, and
in so many they can tell you that this has

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:36.870
happened to them.

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:39.929
So now the first thing is to know that you
have powers.

00:33:39.929 --> 00:33:41.420
Now believe in them.

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:42.470
Have faith in yourself.

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:47.549
If you have left Vishuddhi, this Vishnumaya
won’t work out.

00:33:47.549 --> 00:33:49.870
But be like Vishnumaya.

00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:51.810
Just give up this guilt.

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:54.299
“No, I am a Sahaja yogi.

00:33:54.299 --> 00:33:56.750
I’m not an ordinary person.”

00:33:56.750 --> 00:34:01.390
People sometimes talk to Me and I say, “Do
you know what you are?”

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:02.390
“What, Mother?”

00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:04.600
“You are a Sahaja yogi.”

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.659
“Oh, I forgot.”

00:34:07.659 --> 00:34:12.759
“Now go and do it.”

00:34:12.759 --> 00:34:20.549
And the another style of this left Vishuddhi
is this, which one must understand, that it

00:34:20.549 --> 00:34:22.289
tries to give an explanation.

00:34:22.289 --> 00:34:26.730
As I told you many a time, you tell somebody
that telephone to someone.

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:29.919
First they will say, “He may not be there,
Mother.”

00:34:29.919 --> 00:34:31.169
“Baba, you telephone!

00:34:31.169 --> 00:34:36.960
First find out if he may be there or may not
be there.”

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.099
But they would not.

00:34:39.099 --> 00:34:42.409
They would just avoid, and that is another
thing.

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:45.169
Vishnumaya never avoids, you have seen that.

00:34:45.169 --> 00:34:50.720
Once She has to shine She shines, wherever
She is, whatever She is.

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:53.550
So in the same way we have to be like that.

00:34:53.550 --> 00:35:00.009
We have to know that we are special people,
we are chosen, we are angelic and that we

00:35:00.009 --> 00:35:04.700
have entered into the Kingdom of God, and
it will all work out.

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:07.670
Sahaja Yoga is not meant for useless people.

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:13.129
As I told you, in Marathi, Tukaram has said,
“Yeddya gabalyache kam nave.”

00:35:13.129 --> 00:35:16.109
It’s not meant for lunatics and lousy people.

00:35:16.109 --> 00:35:20.529
It’s meant for somebody who has tyala pahijet
jatiche.

00:35:20.529 --> 00:35:22.849
You need people of character.

00:35:22.849 --> 00:35:29.770
I know that there cannot be many like that,
but there is no place in God’s realm for

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:33.210
many people, for all these useless people.

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:36.489
It’s only for something special.

00:35:36.489 --> 00:35:40.960
These seats are reserved and you have got
your realization now, somehow.

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:47.010
So now try to understand that this Vishnumaya
Principle has to be expressed and has to be

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:50.729
shown, and you introspect yourself: have I
done that or not?

00:35:50.729 --> 00:35:55.270
Don’t be afraid that they say that “But
our ego will come up.”

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:56.270
Doesn’t matter.

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:59.030
You will also see your ego.

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:05.660
This is the second part of Shri Krishna’s
play, that in this Krita Yuga you see your

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:06.660
ego.

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:13.359
There was a lady who was rather not very kind
to some Maharashtrian ladies.

00:36:13.359 --> 00:36:16.180
So I told her, “You have got right side.”

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:17.180
She wouldn’t believe.

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:22.819
She came to see Me in Rome, and she fell down
on right side, completely.

00:36:22.819 --> 00:36:28.279
Then she realized that her right side was
not all right.

00:36:28.279 --> 00:36:34.309
So to know that, whether you have a right
or a left, there’s a very good method, is

00:36:34.309 --> 00:36:35.309
of meditation.

00:36:35.309 --> 00:36:43.319
Now the third situation is that you must accept
whatever is wrong with you.

00:36:43.319 --> 00:36:48.730
If you do not accept, then you have not been
kind to yourself.

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:55.129
That is the central part of it, that you must
accept, “Yes, this is something wrong with

00:36:55.129 --> 00:36:56.129
me.

00:36:56.129 --> 00:37:01.839
I have gone in this part I’m wrong, of my
Vishuddhi, or that part I’m wrong.

00:37:01.839 --> 00:37:04.339
So now I have to improve.”

00:37:04.339 --> 00:37:09.700
Now, right Vishuddhi people will always try
to correct Me.

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:10.700
I’ve seen it.

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:12.879
It’s very simple for them.

00:37:12.879 --> 00:37:15.069
If I say anything, “No.”

00:37:15.069 --> 00:37:16.069
First words.

00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:17.879
Different types “no’s” there are.

00:37:17.879 --> 00:37:18.889
Sometimes, “No!”

00:37:18.889 --> 00:37:29.420
Sometimes it is “No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no!”

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:39.329
They will contradict Me or try to put their
own idea, and then they discover that it was

00:37:39.329 --> 00:37:41.729
wrong; they should not have said it.

00:37:41.729 --> 00:37:47.220
Say for example, if I say, “I saw these
things lying here.”

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:48.549
They said, “No.”

00:37:48.549 --> 00:37:55.420
I said, “I saw with My own eyes and once
I see something, you know, it’s registers,

00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:56.440
it’s there.”

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:57.440
“No.”

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:59.619
I say, “All right, just try to find out.”

00:37:59.619 --> 00:38:00.619
“It’s there.

00:38:00.619 --> 00:38:03.629
How is it we didn’t see?”

00:38:03.629 --> 00:38:09.119
I said, “Because your ‘no’ was written
on your eyes, I think, you couldn’t see

00:38:09.119 --> 00:38:10.119
anything.”

00:38:10.119 --> 00:38:15.210
And then they’ll pull their ears – that’s
the best.

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:21.160
But if you see that “This is a habit I have
of saying no to things.”

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:25.349
So first of all, I also test you.

00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:30.089
Supposing I say it is just now nine o’clock
in the night, you just say yes; let’s see

00:38:30.089 --> 00:38:31.320
what happens.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:33.170
Try to see.

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:43.270
You see, I test you many a times like this
and then I see that some people – if I say

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:48.069
so, all right, if it’s so, if Mother has
said, it is so.

00:38:48.069 --> 00:38:52.229
And then it starts building up their faith
very well.

00:38:52.229 --> 00:39:04.650
I can see they’re, clearly how they are
coming into the realm of real faith, and there

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:06.930
when I say something absurd they’ll just
smile.

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:12.849
They know it is Mother is just testing us,
you see, so they just smile.

00:39:12.849 --> 00:39:16.750
They wouldn’t do anything, but they’ll
just smile.

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:22.220
And then if it is so and if they don’t know,
they’ll say, “Yes, it must be.

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:25.680
Mother must have done this or said so.”

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:28.349
So your testing time is there.

00:39:28.349 --> 00:39:29.859
You have to test yourself.

00:39:29.859 --> 00:39:35.059
As Mohammed Sahib has said, that your hands
will speak and they’ll give witness against

00:39:35.059 --> 00:39:38.249
you – so on your hands you will know.

00:39:38.249 --> 00:39:43.079
Now these hands are the blessings of Shri
Krishna.

00:39:43.079 --> 00:39:50.229
They come out from the same Vishuddhi, and
as you know the pelvic nerves serves it on

00:39:50.229 --> 00:39:51.229
all that.

00:39:51.229 --> 00:39:58.479
And there are two chakras of one Lalita, another
Shri Chakras, all on these both sides; they

00:39:58.479 --> 00:40:01.230
also play into the hands of Shri Krishna.

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:06.089
With these hands we can feel the vibrations.

00:40:06.089 --> 00:40:11.359
Now if your right Vishuddhi’s too strong
you may not feel, if your left Vishuddhi’s

00:40:11.359 --> 00:40:17.990
too strong you may not feel, but that doesn’t
mean that you haven’t got realization.

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.990
You have got.

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:21.299
You just work out your hands.

00:40:21.299 --> 00:40:27.570
Now for working your hands, you have to see
that you don’t use them for useless things.

00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:32.629
That’s very important, because you have
special hands.

00:40:32.629 --> 00:40:39.410
These hands are the ones with which you spread
the collectivity.

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:50.589
Now for example, Italy example this: here
the people when they talk, they’ll go on

00:40:50.589 --> 00:40:54.960
… They don’t know anything what they are
saying, they only know their own, all their

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:57.389
gestures, and they only can depict.

00:40:57.389 --> 00:41:03.690
For a person who doesn’t know them, on they’ll
go on like this, like this, all the time.

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:05.030
So this should be reduced.

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:09.670
There’s no need to use your hands so much
all the time, like this, like that.

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:15.129
Little bit, but while using the hands also
it should be decent, it should be regulated,

00:41:15.129 --> 00:41:24.389
it should be
very indicative and useful.

00:41:24.389 --> 00:41:28.379
Just showing off your hands is not good.

00:41:28.379 --> 00:41:33.619
It is some sort of a theory came out, I was
told, that you must put your gestures into

00:41:33.619 --> 00:41:36.059
your hands and speak.

00:41:36.059 --> 00:41:38.980
Is all right for people like Hitler, but not
for us.

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:41.129
For us we should be decent.

00:41:41.129 --> 00:41:44.859
We should, whenever we have to say – now
for example, you want to point out something

00:41:44.859 --> 00:41:46.460
to someone, shouldn’t say “do this.”

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:50.109
This is Shri Krishna’s finger, you can’t
use it like that.

00:41:50.109 --> 00:41:55.930
Let them do, means supporting everything.

00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:58.849
This looks better.

00:41:58.849 --> 00:42:00.900
These hands are to be used for collectivity.

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:05.029
See, we say “namaste” when we meet others.

00:42:05.029 --> 00:42:07.900
To thousands of people we can say “namaste.”

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:12.319
But I don’t like the shaking hands business
because it’s no good.

00:42:12.319 --> 00:42:14.440
Shaking hands doesn’t create any collectivity.

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:18.789
On the contrary, you might get all kinds of
pins and needles and all kinds of problems

00:42:18.789 --> 00:42:20.509
from others.

00:42:20.509 --> 00:42:28.970
But when you talk to people also, with these
hands only you can feel them; with these hands

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:36.809
only you can care for your children; with
these hands only you can suggest your softness,

00:42:36.809 --> 00:42:43.889
your sweetness, and also with the mouth – which
is of course is a part of the Vishuddhi, that’s

00:42:43.889 --> 00:42:46.700
different – but specially hands.

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:56.480
Your gestures and everything should show very
heartfelt emotions, and then only these gestures

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:58.900
have some meaning.

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:02.960
Now in Sahaja Yoga as you know, you hold each
other’s hands and the vibration starts flowing

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.710
among yourselves.

00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:13.510
And you can also hear the tabla on your throbbings,
so that shows that they are the communication.

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:19.700
So these hands, which are really the beginning
of the collectivity – most important, I

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:28.269
would say the most important things are the
hands, which act for your collectivity.

00:43:28.269 --> 00:43:36.470
As far as you are concerned there are many
other angels and other ganas who are standing

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:37.519
behind you.

00:43:37.519 --> 00:43:44.450
They also, they extend their help to you whenever
you want to communicate something, they also

00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:46.500
do your jobs very well.

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:56.359
So whatever is expressed in your hand or through
your hand, they immediately pick up.

00:43:56.359 --> 00:44:06.920
As you know that Vishuddhi has sixteen petals,
and all ear, nose, throat, eyes, all are guided

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:08.519
by this.

00:44:08.519 --> 00:44:15.589
Also the sub-plexus of this Vishuddhi is this
one, is the Hamsa Chakra.

00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:22.180
So we have these eyes to see, eyes to communicate.

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:29.579
The pure eyes communicate pure love, purity.

00:44:29.579 --> 00:44:37.889
With the pure eyes you can cleanse people,
with the pure eyes you can help others, you

00:44:37.889 --> 00:44:40.139
can bring peace.

00:44:40.139 --> 00:44:44.859
The purification of the eyes takes place through
your Vishuddhi and Agnya.

00:44:44.859 --> 00:44:49.579
Here both things have to work out.

00:44:49.579 --> 00:44:53.489
The nose is very important.

00:44:53.489 --> 00:45:03.289
Nose has to be pure, in the sense that you
should be able to discard whatever is smelling

00:45:03.289 --> 00:45:08.010
badly, and you should be able to accept whatever
is fragrant.

00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:16.259
It’s very important, because nose is the
speciality of Shri Krishna, I would say, in

00:45:16.259 --> 00:45:23.950
the sense that He’s the Kubera, and the
Kubera has given the nose to the Goddess.

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:34.400
Some people have a bad habit of moving their
nose just to show disapproval or something

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.989
like this, they go on doing like that.

00:45:35.989 --> 00:45:43.650
This is very wrong, because then you are insulting
yourself, you’re insulting your Kubera power.

00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:46.849
So you have to keep your nose in a dignified
manner.

00:45:46.849 --> 00:45:49.650
It should be a dignified nose.

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:56.070
It should not be used for doing something
which is undignified, or which expresses contempt.

00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:59.839
Then your teeth are very important.

00:45:59.839 --> 00:46:08.119
You have thirty-two teeth, see: sixteen of
Krishna’s powers divided into, you can say,

00:46:08.119 --> 00:46:09.119
thirty-two.

00:46:09.119 --> 00:46:15.660
These are your teeth on both the sides.

00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:20.479
The right side is on top and the left down
below.

00:46:20.479 --> 00:46:23.619
That is one thing we neglect very much in
the West, I must say.

00:46:23.619 --> 00:46:24.700
In India it is not.

00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:29.559
It is very much we neglect, and that’s what
we have to look after.

00:46:29.559 --> 00:46:39.900
The reason for neglect is that, I would say,
is laziness, must be the laziness, but at

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:44.040
least twice or thrice you must brush your
teeth.

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:51.520
Is important, that I need not say, but more
important is to change the brush.

00:46:51.520 --> 00:47:01.519
Also you have to use butter, or salt and oil
to rub your gums.

00:47:01.519 --> 00:47:09.819
If you rub your gums properly, you will never
have problems with your teeth and your gums.

00:47:09.819 --> 00:47:15.609
Moreover, every time in the evening you must
again brush your teeth.

00:47:15.609 --> 00:47:19.990
I’ve seen many people who come to Me in
the evening in the program, such a horrible

00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:21.800
smell from their mouth comes out.

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:26.739
It is not that it’s a disease but it is,
only thing is that they have not cleansed

00:47:26.739 --> 00:47:28.339
their teeth.

00:47:28.339 --> 00:47:32.819
Also there are people who will not even brush
their teeth, and start eating breakfast.

00:47:32.819 --> 00:47:37.589
I don’t know, it was another theory started,
I think, that you can eat your food without

00:47:37.589 --> 00:47:38.599
brushing.

00:47:38.599 --> 00:47:43.609
Teeth are very important, and one must look
after them.

00:47:43.609 --> 00:47:53.769
On the teeth it depends all the qualities
of your Vishuddhi.

00:47:53.769 --> 00:48:02.849
So one has to look after the teeth in a proper
way, and should never clench and never show

00:48:02.849 --> 00:48:05.220
temper with the teeth.

00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:06.220
It’s a very bad habit.

00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:09.349
Also here is a gesture I have seen that if
they don’t like something, they just go

00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:10.389
on like this.

00:48:10.389 --> 00:48:12.940
It’s a very wrong thing.

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:21.700
One should avoid that kind of a gesture, and
it’s very dangerous for your teeth.

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:30.730
So today’s lecture is more sort of medical,
I must say.

00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:46.389
A person who is spiritually endowed has an
expression which can never be aggressive.

00:48:46.389 --> 00:48:54.539
He may not be good-looking, may not be very,
a sort of a attractive personality, but the

00:48:54.539 --> 00:49:00.920
expression on the face is absolutely saintly.

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:06.000
That is also the blessings of Shri Krishna.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:18.950
I have seen people after one year of realization,
and I was surprised how their faces were changed,

00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:23.069
that I could not recognize them who they were.

00:49:23.069 --> 00:49:30.940
The whole thing becomes absolutely mild, soft,
peaceful and very joyous.

00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:37.569
All the qualities of Shri Krishna can be expressed
on your face.

00:49:37.569 --> 00:49:40.359
You can be sometimes mischievous to look at.

00:49:40.359 --> 00:49:50.900
So many expressions there are which come on
the face, and give you a very sweet feeling.

00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:56.569
But some people have a habit of looking in
the mirror all the time, which is very wrong,

00:49:56.569 --> 00:49:59.759
because it gives you a kind of a funny ego.

00:49:59.759 --> 00:50:04.879
Is better to look at Shri Krishna’s photograph
than to look at your own faces, so that your

00:50:04.879 --> 00:50:08.930
face will become like that of Shri Krishna;
instead of you start looking in the mirror

00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:10.180
all the time.

00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:15.750
What will become of you, God knows, because
maybe if you go to your past, God knows what

00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:16.869
you’ll become.

00:50:16.869 --> 00:50:21.069
So also I’m thankful to psychiatrists that
they don’t like narcissism.

00:50:21.069 --> 00:50:26.219
But it’s very dangerous to all the time
watch your face in the mirror, very dangerous.

00:50:26.219 --> 00:50:31.160
It creates a very funny personality, that
you start telling yourself, “Oh, I’m Napoleon.”

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:36.609
So you become Napoleon, and start behaving
like Napoleon.

00:50:36.609 --> 00:50:41.710
Next day you find one Napoleon walks out of
the bathroom!

00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:50.220
So one has to be careful not to pay so much
attention and importance to your own self,

00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:53.710
but to your Self which is within, which is
your spirit.

00:50:53.710 --> 00:51:00.420
And if you look after that side, then all
these things will happen in such a beautiful

00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:01.480
manner.

00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:04.989
Also the hair are looked after by Shri Krishna.

00:51:04.989 --> 00:51:11.559
Now you see, you know that He’s very fond
of anything that is like butter, so you have

00:51:11.559 --> 00:51:14.950
to put either butter or oil or something in
your hair.

00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:17.660
If you don’t put it you’ll become bald.

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:22.200
What can – I mean it is after all a karma
phala.

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:24.089
If you don’t put oil, you’ll become bald.

00:51:24.089 --> 00:51:29.819
So you have to put oil, and oil was put always
before in the West.

00:51:29.819 --> 00:51:34.299
I see all these old films and all that, they’re
all oiled people.

00:51:34.299 --> 00:51:39.619
But now of course, if you don’t want to
put oil in the daytime you can wash it off,

00:51:39.619 --> 00:51:45.030
but at least once a week you must oil your
head.

00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:50.069
Shri Krishna’s star is Saturn, Shani.

00:51:50.069 --> 00:51:59.720
They say that if He gets after somebody, then
nobody can be saved.

00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:03.619
If Shri Krishna gets after someone, then nobody
can be saved.

00:52:03.619 --> 00:52:09.230
In the same way, if Saturn gets after someone
then that person is finished, so we say it’s

00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:13.329
for sometimes, it is seven years He’s after
you, or sometimes two-and-a-half years after

00:52:13.329 --> 00:52:14.329
you.

00:52:14.329 --> 00:52:26.349
So this Saturn of Shri Krishna is a, it’s
a quality within us that, supposing if somebody

00:52:26.349 --> 00:52:31.400
troubles us or does something, we don’t
have to do anything.

00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:40.410
Now this Shri Krishna policy, this, we can
say, the Shri Krishna’s nature will work

00:52:40.410 --> 00:52:42.589
it out.

00:52:42.589 --> 00:52:52.099
It will inform this all-pervading Power, and
through that this man or this woman, or this

00:52:52.099 --> 00:52:56.309
party or this organization which is trying
to trouble us will be hounded, while we’ll

00:52:56.309 --> 00:52:57.789
be just sitting doing nothing.

00:52:57.789 --> 00:53:03.289
They’ll be just hounded till they jump in
the sea.

00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:06.680
[missing part] plays around, but
He doesn’t forgive.

00:53:06.730 --> 00:53:08.980
He doesn’t believe in forgiveness.

00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:12.140
He says, “Now, you had enough of it.”

00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:18.780
He gives a big, big long rope to hang yourself,
but He never forgives.

00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:21.740
One thing for definite, He never forgives.

00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:26.220
As you must have seen in Mahabharata His own
judgment of things, you see, He doesn’t

00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.220
forgive.

00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:28.220
He says, “You have to pay.

00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:31.270
You have to pay for it.”

00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:34.873
Except when, when you transcend.

00:53:35.753 --> 00:53:49.192
If you become a Sahaja yogi, if you have transcended
Vishuddhi, then He cannot do anything like

00:53:49.192 --> 00:53:50.333
that to you.

00:53:50.333 --> 00:53:57.553
But if you have not, if there’s no ascent
you cannot be saved, you cannot be saved from

00:53:57.553 --> 00:53:58.553
Him.

00:53:58.553 --> 00:54:03.523
They say once Mohammed Gajani came to loot
our country – I mean, it’s a story about

00:54:03.523 --> 00:54:06.632
the village folk.

00:54:06.632 --> 00:54:12.603
And there he’s looted Somnath, a big temple
of ours, which had lots of gold, jewelry,

00:54:12.603 --> 00:54:14.393
everything in it.

00:54:14.393 --> 00:54:19.575
So these brahmins were, you see, taking money
from all these people and looting them, and

00:54:19.575 --> 00:54:27.543
putting them in the temple and using them,
and the rest of the people were very poor.

00:54:27.543 --> 00:54:35.363
So it was sort of a reaction in them, and
the story they tell like this: so this Mohammed

00:54:35.363 --> 00:54:40.343
Gajani looted Somnath, is the temple of Mahadeva.

00:54:40.343 --> 00:54:46.062
Now Mahadeva never needs any ornaments or
anything, but they had put this there.

00:54:46.062 --> 00:54:54.783
So Hanumana saw that Mahadeva got out of the
temple and was running, so Hanumana ran after

00:54:54.783 --> 00:54:55.783
Him.

00:54:55.783 --> 00:55:00.063
Then at one point Mahadeva sat down, and Hanumana
came.

00:55:00.063 --> 00:55:03.033
He said, “You are the God of Gods.

00:55:03.033 --> 00:55:04.442
Why are You running?

00:55:04.442 --> 00:55:06.212
What are You afraid of?”

00:55:06.212 --> 00:55:08.533
He said, “You don’t know this Mohammed
Gajani?”

00:55:08.533 --> 00:55:10.212
He said, “No I don’t know.”

00:55:10.212 --> 00:55:11.892
“All right, hide behind a tree.”

00:55:11.892 --> 00:55:13.293
They hid behind a tree.

00:55:13.293 --> 00:55:17.852
So this Mohammed Gajani came and sat down
– this is the folklore I’m telling, folk

00:55:17.852 --> 00:55:21.842
people tell – sat down under that tree.

00:55:21.842 --> 00:55:27.482
And turning to Shri Krishna, he said, “This
horrible thing, if He gets after someone,

00:55:27.482 --> 00:55:29.732
who can be saved?

00:55:29.732 --> 00:55:33.922
Under my nose these brahmins were making money
and all that, putting it in Somnath temple,

00:55:33.922 --> 00:55:35.992
which was not to be done.

00:55:35.992 --> 00:55:41.863
I couldn’t do anything, so He came, and
with this fellow after me I cannot be saved

00:55:41.863 --> 00:55:45.302
either, so I am running away from the temple.”

00:55:45.302 --> 00:55:52.053
So this is the story given by the villagers,
but which shows that if Shri Krishna is after

00:55:52.053 --> 00:55:56.742
somebody, then nobody can save that person,
he has to run away; because He has so many

00:55:56.742 --> 00:56:01.462
tricks and so many styles that you can’t
get out of it.

00:56:01.462 --> 00:56:06.302
He’ll use His brains in so many manners,
and that He’ll put that person right who

00:56:06.302 --> 00:56:08.732
is trying to trouble you.

00:56:08.732 --> 00:56:16.083
So you must have complete faith in the powers
of Shri Krishna which is within yourself,

00:56:16.083 --> 00:56:17.972
which is being aware now.

00:56:17.972 --> 00:56:23.942
And also if you have ascended fully out of
this, then He will not trouble; but if you

00:56:23.942 --> 00:56:28.793
have left Vishuddhi He will trouble you, definitely.

00:56:28.793 --> 00:56:31.682
If you have left Vishuddhi Shri Krishna will
definitely trouble you, and be careful.

00:56:31.682 --> 00:56:34.492
So get rid of your left Vishuddhis now.

00:56:34.492 --> 00:56:35.712
That’s very important.

00:56:35.712 --> 00:56:41.853
Because then Shri Krishna will take your test
and will make you so miserable that you will

00:56:41.853 --> 00:56:42.952
not know why.

00:56:42.952 --> 00:56:47.722
“Mother, You see, I did this, I did this
puja, I did this till, let’s see now, this

00:56:47.722 --> 00:56:49.932
is the situation in my family.

00:56:49.932 --> 00:56:51.313
This is what happened.”

00:56:51.313 --> 00:56:54.602
“All right, are you a Catholic?”

00:56:54.602 --> 00:56:55.602
“Yes.”

00:56:55.602 --> 00:56:56.862
“Feel guilty?”

00:56:56.862 --> 00:56:57.862
“Yes.”

00:56:57.862 --> 00:56:59.882
“So have it.”

00:56:59.882 --> 00:57:00.882
What can I do?

00:57:00.882 --> 00:57:03.073
Shri Krishna cannot be controlled by anyone.

00:57:03.073 --> 00:57:09.742
He does whatever He thinks proper and He is
meant to really punish much more than the

00:57:09.742 --> 00:57:12.732
Mother, I can tell you.

00:57:12.732 --> 00:57:18.402
They say that She’s Adi Rudra, Adi Saumya:
She’s the one who’s very hard and also

00:57:18.402 --> 00:57:22.682
very, very soft, but up to a point.

00:57:22.682 --> 00:57:24.102
He is not.

00:57:24.102 --> 00:57:25.302
Nothing can convince Him.

00:57:25.302 --> 00:57:32.212
Once you get into His control, that He’ll
see to it that you are put right, left, right,

00:57:32.212 --> 00:57:34.932
any way He’ll make you all right.

00:57:34.932 --> 00:57:40.482
So one thing is there, that you should be
sure that you should have your Vishuddhis

00:57:40.482 --> 00:57:47.592
all right, first of all, and also get Shri
Krishna manifesting on others.

00:57:47.592 --> 00:57:49.253
You don’t have to do anything.

00:57:49.253 --> 00:57:51.365
He’ll look after you, everything, and work
it out.

00:57:51.365 --> 00:57:55.773
But left Vishuddhi is a disease of the West.

00:57:55.773 --> 00:58:00.663
I also feel so much from you all that I sometimes
feel like running away to India, because in

00:58:00.663 --> 00:58:02.692
India nobody feels guilty.

00:58:02.692 --> 00:58:04.803
They don’t believe in feeling guilty.

00:58:04.803 --> 00:58:05.853
“What is there?

00:58:05.853 --> 00:58:07.313
We have not murdered anyone.

00:58:07.313 --> 00:58:09.043
Why should we feel guilty?”

00:58:09.043 --> 00:58:12.033
Here it is a disease with everyone, “I feel
guilty.”

00:58:12.033 --> 00:58:19.452
I don’t know who has introduced this idea,
maybe this Catholic Church, but carried too

00:58:19.452 --> 00:58:20.452
far.

00:58:20.452 --> 00:58:26.842
So then we come to the Virata's point, is
here.

00:58:26.842 --> 00:58:33.122
Before that we have to cross the Hamsa; without
that you cannot reach the Virat point.

00:58:33.122 --> 00:58:40.543
So Hamsa is as you know very well, is the
discretion, divine discretion, which must

00:58:40.543 --> 00:58:43.872
be within you.

00:58:43.872 --> 00:58:48.462
Once you develop that, then you don’t commit
mistakes.

00:58:48.462 --> 00:58:54.132
You never commit mistakes – mistakes in
the sense you don’t do things which are

00:58:54.132 --> 00:58:56.702
again pushed back on you, or for which you
have to pay.

00:58:56.702 --> 00:58:59.793
It’s just a very straightforward life.

00:58:59.793 --> 00:59:01.162
“It’s so?

00:59:01.162 --> 00:59:02.523
It’s so.”

00:59:02.523 --> 00:59:08.343
With this discretion, absolutely you have
a complete understanding as to what has to

00:59:08.343 --> 00:59:11.083
be done and what not to be done.

00:59:11.083 --> 00:59:14.322
And if that is established, a discretion is
established.

00:59:14.322 --> 00:59:19.302
In many Sahaja yogis, I must say, discretion
has come even with their left Vishuddhi.

00:59:19.302 --> 00:59:23.523
Even if they have left Vishuddhi they have
this discretion, they know what is right and

00:59:23.523 --> 00:59:24.523
what is wrong.

00:59:24.523 --> 00:59:31.263
With that divine discretion, the first thing
that happens is that people get impressed

00:59:31.263 --> 00:59:32.263
by you.

00:59:32.263 --> 00:59:34.783
It’s real collectivity, it impresses the
collectivity.

00:59:34.783 --> 00:59:39.892
A person who has divine discretion, people
immediately see the wisdom of that person

00:59:39.892 --> 00:59:42.784
and think, “See now, this man, how could
he be?

00:59:42.784 --> 00:59:44.742
He’s so young, how could he be?

00:59:44.742 --> 00:59:47.822
He’s such a child, how could he be?”

00:59:47.822 --> 00:59:57.072
So this divine discretion which is the, here,
Hamsa Chakra’s speciality, when it starts

00:59:57.072 --> 01:00:05.302
manifesting then automatically you impress,
automatically you impress the collectivity.

01:00:05.302 --> 01:00:09.732
This is a very important point one has to
know.

01:00:09.732 --> 01:00:15.073
While introspecting yourself, you just see
if you have developed this quality of divine

01:00:15.073 --> 01:00:16.152
discretion or not.

01:00:16.152 --> 01:00:20.533
For example, there are many I have seen when
they come to the program, they come and tell

01:00:20.533 --> 01:00:23.783
Me, “Mother, some Sahaja yogi told me that
‘You have a bhoot.’

01:00:23.783 --> 01:00:26.132
Have I got a bhoot in me?”

01:00:26.132 --> 01:00:27.813
I said, “Not at all.

01:00:27.813 --> 01:00:30.513
How can there be any bhoot in you?”

01:00:30.513 --> 01:00:36.632
He may be having, but the divine discretion
is not to tell him just now, but to remove

01:00:36.632 --> 01:00:37.632
it.

01:00:37.632 --> 01:00:48.063
So divine discretion gives you a complete
understanding what is the way to handle another

01:00:48.063 --> 01:00:56.132
personality, what is the way to handle a collective,
how to talk to others, how to impress on them

01:00:56.132 --> 01:00:57.753
the right things.

01:00:57.753 --> 01:01:05.682
It’s a very, very expansive manifestation
in so many directions.

01:01:05.682 --> 01:01:09.142
If you have no divine discretion, you’ll
start speaking what you should not speak,

01:01:09.142 --> 01:01:14.053
you’ll start saying at a time when you should
not say.

01:01:14.053 --> 01:01:18.153
I mean, you’ll have no sense at all of any
direction.

01:01:18.153 --> 01:01:25.132
So to have divine discretion is very important,
for which as you know, Hamsa Chakra physically

01:01:25.132 --> 01:01:30.873
as well mentally and also spiritually must
be kept all right.

01:01:30.873 --> 01:01:37.073
In My Hamsas – we had one puja where I talked
about it.

01:01:37.073 --> 01:01:41.563
The last is the Virat: that is the state you
have to reach.

01:01:41.563 --> 01:01:46.842
Is the Virat is here in front, as you know.

01:01:46.842 --> 01:01:56.312
And I was surprised when I went to Nepal,
which is a temple of Shiva there: despite

01:01:56.312 --> 01:02:01.822
they were worshipping Shiva they were putting
all the kumkum here.

01:02:01.822 --> 01:02:06.652
So I thought that they don’t know why they
are putting, because even if you worship Shiva

01:02:06.652 --> 01:02:09.692
you must also worship here, the Virata.

01:02:09.692 --> 01:02:17.742
They don’t put it here – here; because
they’re absolutely hundred percent only

01:02:17.742 --> 01:02:22.312
Shiva worshippers, so why should they put
it here?

01:02:22.312 --> 01:02:32.472
Because somebody who knows, who was gnostic,
has told them that this is the place of Virat.

01:02:32.472 --> 01:02:49.962
Once you get into Virata, then all your ideas
of separating or differentiating goes away.

01:02:49.962 --> 01:02:59.212
You do not have any more ideas of races left,
of nationality, of your city, of your village

01:02:59.212 --> 01:03:00.492
or anything.

01:03:00.492 --> 01:03:07.212
At that stage you don’t belong to any place.

01:03:07.212 --> 01:03:09.462
You belong to every place, and you don’t
belong to every place.

01:03:09.462 --> 01:03:14.872
Such a situation comes in when you don’t
hanker after any particular food, you don’t

01:03:14.872 --> 01:03:24.802
like any particular type of people, you can
adjust yourself into any circumstances, into

01:03:24.802 --> 01:03:29.442
any families, into any kind of people.

01:03:29.442 --> 01:03:31.062
You can live with drunkards.

01:03:31.062 --> 01:03:38.802
I mean I have lived with drunkards – “lived”
means I have shaken hands at least with so

01:03:38.802 --> 01:03:40.172
many of them.

01:03:40.172 --> 01:03:43.382
You can be with any kind of person.

01:03:43.382 --> 01:03:48.932
Nothing bothers you because you are in the
Virata state; because everything is absorbed

01:03:48.932 --> 01:03:52.202
by the Virat, and you do not feel anything.

01:03:52.202 --> 01:03:55.503
Whatever sort of person may be, you do not
feel it.

01:03:55.503 --> 01:04:01.273
The Virat has to suffer, not you, and that
is what is the best state where I want all

01:04:01.273 --> 01:04:07.162
of you to reach, and to become absolutely
free.

01:04:07.162 --> 01:04:13.283
Nothing can impress you, nothing can influence
you, nothing can dissuade you, but you stand

01:04:13.283 --> 01:04:18.802
on your self-esteem and understanding about
yourself, that you’re a Sahaja yogi and

01:04:18.802 --> 01:04:28.832
that you are connected with this power, and
you are a citizen of Kingdom of God.

01:04:28.832 --> 01:04:39.952
At the Virata state there's no doubt left
about it, no doubt, because you become part

01:04:39.952 --> 01:04:44.872
and parcel of the whole, absolutely, and you
can affect anywhere.

01:04:44.872 --> 01:04:47.132
If this finger is hurt, then this finger can
feel it.

01:04:47.132 --> 01:04:56.033
In the same way such a person is felt everywhere,
and not only that, but that person can be

01:04:56.033 --> 01:04:57.952
effective everywhere.

01:04:57.952 --> 01:05:05.112
For that state of reaching to Virat, one should
try to slowly, gradually, “Ya neti neti

01:05:05.112 --> 01:05:07.382
vachanaih nirgama avochu” say.

01:05:07.382 --> 01:05:09.692
You have to go on saying, “This is not my
sister.

01:05:09.692 --> 01:05:11.112
This is not my brother.

01:05:11.112 --> 01:05:13.052
They are all my brothers.

01:05:13.052 --> 01:05:14.622
They’re all my sisters.

01:05:14.622 --> 01:05:18.783
I love them the same as my sisters and my
brothers.

01:05:18.783 --> 01:05:20.372
This is not my family.

01:05:20.372 --> 01:05:23.342
The whole Sahaja Yoga is my family.”

01:05:23.342 --> 01:05:27.082
The whole attention should move like that.

01:05:27.082 --> 01:05:31.632
“This is not only mine, it is everybody’s.

01:05:31.632 --> 01:05:34.192
It belongs to everyone.

01:05:34.192 --> 01:05:36.382
Everybody has a right.”

01:05:36.382 --> 01:05:41.432
That sort of a thing, when it starts growing
from individual, what we call is the “vestiti

01:05:41.432 --> 01:05:48.712
tu sumestiti” in Sanskrit, they say “vestiti
tu sumestiti,” from individual to collective.

01:05:48.712 --> 01:05:54.972
And such a personality then is the most effective
one for any kind of collective work.

01:05:54.972 --> 01:05:59.142
I think for today it’s quite sufficient
for you to know about Vishuddhi Chakra.

01:05:59.142 --> 01:06:05.182
I mean, I have talked about it thousands and
thousands of times, and now this is one of

01:06:05.182 --> 01:06:10.273
the sides which I wanted to say, because I
find that still there are people who do not

01:06:10.273 --> 01:06:13.732
understand that they have to rise above Vishuddhi.

01:06:13.732 --> 01:06:20.363
Otherwise, if they do not ascend over Vishuddhi
they can never be proper Sahaja yogis, they’ll

01:06:20.363 --> 01:06:22.172
be always half-baked.

01:06:22.172 --> 01:06:29.682
So we must try to rise above the Vishuddhi,
the discretion part.

01:06:29.692 --> 01:06:37.869
Then at that point we can never doubt Sahaja
Yoga, can never doubt, and that’s how the

01:06:37.949 --> 01:06:40.594
doubtless awareness can come to us.

01:06:41.509 --> 01:06:43.451
May God bless you.

01:06:54.938 --> 01:06:55.938
All right.

01:06:56.058 --> 01:07:02.318
Shri Krishna Puja is very small that way,
not such a long thing.
