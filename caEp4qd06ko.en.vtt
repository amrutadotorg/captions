00:51.823 --> 01:01.735
Public Program, 26 April 1999
Levent Kırca and Oya Basar Theatre, Istanbul (Turkey)

02:58.376 --> 03:03.177
I bow to all the seekers  of truth.

03:09.138 --> 03:18.098
We are at the time bond, is very important.

03:22.541 --> 03:26.996
At this time there is so much of turmoils,

03:27.020 --> 03:30.625
so much of problems, so many wars,

03:30.702 --> 03:39.016
all kinds of interrogation has taken place in our value system.

03:52.936 --> 03:57.898
And we are quite shocked about that, very much shocked.

04:04.763 --> 04:08.882
What is the problem?

04:09.382 --> 04:12.536
Why this is happening?

04:12.633 --> 04:15.460
We should try to find out.

04:20.499 --> 04:26.082
And if there is a solution
we should try to achieve it.

04:31.121 --> 04:36.607
The problems are there because
human beings do not know themselves.

04:43.652 --> 04:47.405
Either they think too much of themselves,

04:47.430 --> 04:51.765
they have too much of Ego or
they are very much conditioned.

05:04.728 --> 05:08.442
There is no conditioning

05:08.491 --> 05:12.278
that we can say  is not troublesome,

05:22.171 --> 05:26.402
because they blindly accept all the nonsense.

05:33.173 --> 05:38.976
Now we  see the problem, say
we are born in particular religion

05:44.487 --> 05:50.472
and we just start following everything that is told to us.

05:58.386 --> 06:03.743
I ask people if they have read Quran Sharif

06:09.118 --> 06:11.627
Very few have really read

06:14.831 --> 06:19.530
and is completely, sometimes, I find is represented.

06:26.413 --> 06:31.039
That brings bad name to Islam, also to Muhammad Sahab.

06:47.002 --> 06:53.549
According to us prophet  Muhammad was a very, very great soul.

06:59.059 --> 07:08.740
We call him as Adi Guru, means one of the
primordial masters who got birth on this Earth.

07:19.537 --> 07:24.070
Now such a great soul like him would not say he is divine.

07:24.095 --> 07:28.318
I can not believe that,
but he did not say once divine.

07:35.066 --> 07:38.686
Maybe because if somebody says he is Divine,

07:38.711 --> 07:42.976
then peoplejust get  after the life of a  divine personality.

07:52.501 --> 07:56.256
And it is how much he was tortured,

07:56.313 --> 08:00.506
how much he was troubled, endless.

08:09.518 --> 08:14.289
No one may  say why should such a Divine person suffered,

08:14.347 --> 08:18.140
he did not suffered but he had sufferings

08:18.191 --> 08:22.188
even by people who were ignorant,

08:35.105 --> 08:39.764
because they were absolutely blind.

08:39.799 --> 08:44.616
They didn't  know  what sort of a great person he was.

08:53.867 --> 08:57.901
All such great saints had suffer.

09:02.402 --> 09:06.018
All over the world the saints had suffered

09:10.342 --> 09:17.988
because the people do not know what saintliness is.

09:23.520 --> 09:27.293
First of all they should know themselves.

09:31.529 --> 09:37.272
Once they know themselves,
they will know what Muhammad Sahab was.

09:45.256 --> 09:49.372
They will also know about Quran-ı Sharif
(Sharif -Holy, honorable).

09:53.137 --> 09:58.440
It is absolutely clear cut in the Qur’an,

09:58.523 --> 10:03.104
but people  want to listen the pret,
you can not help it.

10:11.059 --> 10:17.102
Christ also said that know thy self.

10:22.945 --> 10:30.551
All those, who were so great,
had told to know ourselves.

10:37.720 --> 10:41.632
Those who had not known themselves, have no right

10:41.680 --> 10:47.192
to talk about them or to condemn them
or to say horrible things.

11:00.331 --> 11:03.307
After you have come to know yourself only,

11:03.323 --> 11:06.763
you will know how great they were

11:13.858 --> 11:18.748
and how Quran Sharif is such an important book.

11:26.544 --> 11:31.728
Even those who read such a great book

11:31.753 --> 11:35.564
are doing all kinds of nonsensical things .

11:43.640 --> 11:47.253
They have no control over their greed.

11:50.615 --> 11:53.712
They have no control over their lust,

11:56.955 --> 11:59.569
they can be very cruel also.

12:02.050 --> 12:04.613
How can that be?

12:07.484 --> 12:11.628
If you read such a great book like Quran Sharif,

12:11.653 --> 12:14.924
then how can you be like that?

12:21.799 --> 12:25.833
Because  all this reading does not go in the heart.

12:30.474 --> 12:39.176
He has talked about Rahmet (mercy, clemency),
he called it Rahim (compassionate, forgiving) .

12:51.972 --> 12:54.678
Where is that Rahmet?

12:54.838 --> 12:57.666
If do you see that  anywhere?

13:01.478 --> 13:05.320
They are all killing each other in the name of God.

13:09.503 --> 13:17.023
So this is the state of the truth,
of reality, of divinity.

13:23.826 --> 13:28.383
Now what is needed is first to know thy self.

13:33.330 --> 13:39.910
For that, it is placed within you,
in the triangle bone,

13:40.820 --> 13:45.137
this special power  called as Kundalini,

13:45.489 --> 13:52.666
whether you are a Hindu, Muslim, Christian, anything.

13:59.372 --> 14:03.856
As they have a heart, they also have this power.

14:08.038 --> 14:11.172
Then how can we say we are different?

14:15.577 --> 14:18.444
We are all human begins, no doubt.

14:21.362 --> 14:27.105
But the power of the saint is in every human being.

14:31.572 --> 14:35.745
So we have to accept that we all can ascent

14:35.803 --> 14:39.297
whether we follow this religion, or that religion,

14:39.316 --> 14:42.508
or this country, or that country,
makes no difference.

14:53.027 --> 14:55.709
It's written in  Quran Sharif also

14:55.757 --> 14:59.147
it is not only my words, it is written everywhere

14:59.172 --> 15:02.996
that we all human beings are the same.

15:12.615 --> 15:15.823
If so, if that is the situation,

15:15.848 --> 15:20.048
then why  should we all not know ourselves.

15:24.927 --> 15:31.390
It is very easy to know yourself in these modern times,

15:36.658 --> 15:38.283
It has been the esteem

15:38.308 --> 15:43.545
that  in these modern times we should know ourselves.

15:51.713 --> 15:55.659
You have to have the Self knowledge.

16:02.548 --> 16:07.248
You have knowledge of everything outside
what about your Self?

16:15.656 --> 16:19.724
When you will know your Self you will be amazed

16:19.733 --> 16:26.745
that you all are part and parcel of one great personality, Upper.

16:38.392 --> 16:42.209
When we say “Allah hu Akbar
(Lord, the Biggest)”

16:42.753 --> 16:46.936
what do we say is that we are one,

16:46.961 --> 16:50.845
in one personality that is Upper.

17:03.502 --> 17:08.151
Just by think “Allah hu Akbar”, you do not realized,

17:08.187 --> 17:13.196
you do not become part and parcel of the great Upper.

17:20.961 --> 17:25.595
You go out shouting for ages, for centuries,

17:25.701 --> 17:30.157
you will not become part and parcel of Upper.

17:39.926 --> 17:43.356
For that you have to know yourself

17:43.388 --> 17:50.403
and that you have to get connected to
this all pervading Power of Ruh (Spirit).

18:02.221 --> 18:05.705
You have some Sufis,
but nobody believed them

18:05.721 --> 18:08.628
because they were realized souls.

18:17.331 --> 18:22.560
Especially in your country, you had such a great people

18:22.585 --> 18:26.719
who came to tell you that you should know yourself ,

18:35.139 --> 18:40.290
but we got lost, in these modern times
we got lost, completely.

18:46.431 --> 18:48.867
Where are we?

18:53.705 --> 18:56.892
What are we fighting for?

19:02.006 --> 19:07.180
How can blind fight,

19:10.487 --> 19:12.640
we do not  know anything,

19:12.720 --> 19:15.397
we do not know  our meaning.

19:20.634 --> 19:22.784
How is possible?

19:23.009 --> 19:28.455
It is very much possible for you all to get your

19:28.480 --> 19:33.272
self realization, self knowledge, to know yourself.

19:41.150 --> 19:46.152
Even if you are fanatics, listen to me.

19:49.825 --> 19:54.081
Because this will  save you, save your children,

19:54.152 --> 19:58.802
save everyone, save Turkey and save the whole world.

20:07.150 --> 20:11.516
You have to raise  about this limited ideas,

20:11.542 --> 20:14.486
that you get from others.

20:25.618 --> 20:29.927
You have to have a feeling,

20:30.010 --> 20:33.763
the experience of  this Ruh.

20:38.767 --> 20:46.023
Without that , you cannot know anything
about prophet Muhammad or Islam.

20:55.761 --> 20:58.720
Islam is to surrender,

21:01.712 --> 21:04.575
it doesn't mean  aggression.

21:11.738 --> 21:15.248
Surrender to who?

21:17.664 --> 21:21.586
To God, to his power,

21:21.650 --> 21:25.382
which is the power of love.

21:31.443 --> 21:33.403
God loved us,

21:33.523 --> 21:36.181
so he created us.

21:41.746 --> 21:46.074
If we haven't got that power of love,

21:46.130 --> 21:49.495
if we haven't just  his power of love ,

21:49.520 --> 21:53.689
no use during any namaz or anything no use.

22:05.584 --> 22:08.703
The namaz (daily Muslim worshiping) you do is nothing,

22:09.000 --> 22:11.880
but for your Kundalini awakening.

22:20.908 --> 22:23.511
You will realize that

22:23.536 --> 22:26.509
after your Self Knowledge,

22:26.914 --> 22:31.242
even if you do namaz it has great meaning.

22:40.544 --> 22:44.901
Once you start feeling this cool breeze

22:44.942 --> 22:47.412
after Holy Ghost as they call it,

22:47.548 --> 22:49.897
or you  can say this Ruh,

22:50.225 --> 22:56.521
then when you do namaz it goes on increasing,
you go on

22:57.731 --> 23:00.367
becoming higher and higher.

23:11.249 --> 23:15.312
Otherwise, any number of namaz can you do,

23:15.337 --> 23:18.822
rouse are you do, you can not do it.

23:28.403 --> 23:33.482
And a seed has to be sprout,

23:33.726 --> 23:36.210
otherwise it cannot grow.

23:42.125 --> 23:47.078
In the same way your Kundalini has to be awaken

23:47.103 --> 23:49.954
like a primula  of a seed.
(brightly coloured flowers in the spring)

23:57.178 --> 24:02.951
Without this sprouting,
how can you grow, artificially?

24:08.896 --> 24:15.016
So please understand that first let this sprouting things

24:21.692 --> 24:24.567
and then you do namaz,

24:24.718 --> 24:27.849
and you will be amazed that

24:27.890 --> 24:30.415
the chaitanya work on

24:30.449 --> 24:35.150
vibrations there  are flowing increase tremendously.

24:49.016 --> 24:52.156
Also then you read Qur’an

24:52.191 --> 24:56.516
and these vibrations will increase tremendously!

25:03.683 --> 25:06.738
You will grow very fast.

25:11.460 --> 25:15.531
All the things that you do in the name of God,

25:15.582 --> 25:18.216
you will have the experience

25:18.319 --> 25:21.905
that are all true, there is truth in it.

25:29.184 --> 25:34.886
But you have to allow the seed to be sprout.

25:38.685 --> 25:46.264
Without that you are just like any other  material.

25:51.793 --> 25:58.125
Something artificial living in the false world,

25:58.582 --> 26:01.693
doing all kinds of wrong things

26:02.185 --> 26:07.245
without bothering about God Almighty.

26:17.147 --> 26:18.890
Not only that you will know your Self,

26:18.915 --> 26:23.806
but you will know all the powers that
get out of that knowledge.

26:34.656 --> 26:40.920
The first power you get is of tremendously creativity.

26:47.189 --> 26:51.157
As it is Turkish are known for their  creativity,

26:57.602 --> 27:01.939
they will create  such a beautiful art

27:02.003 --> 27:07.831
that it will be appealing to the
whole world on Global level.

27:19.967 --> 27:25.657
Now you become extremely moral by nature.

27:30.657 --> 27:35.919
You do not have to be very rigid about this,

27:36.626 --> 27:40.797
you just become you become very moral.

27:49.643 --> 27:53.161
Whatever is said  “don’t do this, don’t do that!”,

27:53.193 --> 27:56.209
nothing is to be told;

28:02.839 --> 28:06.761
because your Spirit is now enlightened

28:10.523 --> 28:15.009
and in the blank of that spirit
you know what is good for you,

28:15.015 --> 28:16.930
and what is distracting for you.

28:25.490 --> 28:30.102
Now Muhammed said not to drink alcohol,

28:30.176 --> 28:32.763
we do not say do not drink ,

28:39.369 --> 28:43.980
because if I say that half of the people will just go away.

28:50.823 --> 28:54.267
But after you get this knowledge

28:54.319 --> 28:57.114
which is constructive for yourself ,

28:57.147 --> 28:59.760
you yourself do not drink,

28:59.785 --> 29:02.332
you do not take any alcohol,

29:02.366 --> 29:04.774
you do not take any drug,
you do not smoke,

29:04.822 --> 29:08.723
you do not take anything
that can destroy your body.

29:21.402 --> 29:23.942
You do not have to tell your children

29:23.967 --> 29:28.055
“do this, do that” , it works out automatically.

29:33.344 --> 29:37.851
It is very surprising how powerful you become,

29:37.901 --> 29:41.753
that you do not have to do anything

29:41.803 --> 29:45.263
to stop yourself of doing something wrong.

29:57.949 --> 30:00.933
Then you become very sensitive

30:00.968 --> 30:03.644
as to what is right and what is wrong

30:03.669 --> 30:07.343
and you just do not accept that is wrong.

30:15.624 --> 30:21.753
This discrimination  is just within you,
which is enlightened.

30:30.012 --> 30:36.817
Then for everything: for food, for

30:36.984 --> 30:41.830
taking out money, this -that, all this greed business

30:41.983 --> 30:44.086
just get controlled.

30:54.076 --> 30:59.576
Above all you become a very very loving person.

31:04.603 --> 31:08.525
You have faith in your own love

31:11.716 --> 31:14.828
and you see that your love  succeeds

31:20.107 --> 31:23.166
and you are amazed how it works.

31:26.855 --> 31:29.157
Now the time has come

31:29.205 --> 31:32.347
what you call as a last judgment.

31:36.308 --> 31:40.858
Now if you get to the right religion,

31:40.922 --> 31:45.735
if you get to the right understanding of yourself,

31:45.770 --> 31:52.597
so you should know you have decided for the highest ascent.

32:06.543 --> 32:11.376
This you will experience yourself

32:15.376 --> 32:20.226
that you have become extremely loving,

32:21.110 --> 32:23.794
kind, forgiving person.

32:30.635 --> 32:36.066
But by doing that you don't become,
don't become weak,

32:36.075 --> 32:38.217
but  you become very strong.

32:44.427 --> 32:47.795
You didn't  see despite all of position

32:47.820 --> 32:53.096
how your Sufis have  stayed

32:53.121 --> 32:55.801
that's    on their path of truth.

33:05.813 --> 33:10.458
But now you are not alone, you are not alone.

33:14.265 --> 33:17.710
You have thousands of them all over the world.

33:22.059 --> 33:25.368
They are your brothers and sisters all over.

33:29.793 --> 33:33.406
You will be amazed how they look after you.

33:36.705 --> 33:38.903
How they are bothered about you,

33:42.345 --> 33:48.440
when you become one with the all pervading akbar,

33:48.465 --> 33:50.845
then who is the other?

33:58.344 --> 34:04.458
For example, anything happens to
this finger the whole body reacts.

34:10.207 --> 34:15.859
In the same way all the Sahaja yogis,
all the people all over the world,

34:15.884 --> 34:19.688
who know themselves, will react  together

34:27.796 --> 34:32.996
and their good wishes will act
through the Divine Power.

34:40.821 --> 34:45.469
Gradually all this destructive nature

34:45.502 --> 34:51.635
and also the falsehood of people drops out.

35:01.957 --> 35:05.953
Also you develop another

35:05.978 --> 35:08.972
dimension in your awareness

35:15.284 --> 35:20.866
which is called as collective consciousness.

35:24.230 --> 35:30.056
So what you do, you can  feel
another person on your  fingertips.

35:34.429 --> 35:37.527
You can feel yourself also on your fingertips.

35:41.106 --> 35:43.931
That is what Mohamed Sahab has said,

35:43.995 --> 35:47.338
that at the time of Resurrection Kıyama

35:47.385 --> 35:49.367
your hands will speak

35:49.392 --> 35:53.640
and will give şahadet  (witness) against you.

36:09.017 --> 36:12.119
They will tell you what is wrong with you,

36:15.252 --> 36:20.077
your fingers will tell you what is wrong
with you, with your body,

36:20.102 --> 36:24.045
with your mind, everything you can know on your fingertips.

36:31.989 --> 36:36.020
Now if you know how to correct

36:36.285 --> 36:42.305
those defects in you, you can correct anybody’s problems,

36:50.936 --> 36:55.736
because you can also feel
what is wrong with them on your fingertips.

37:02.288 --> 37:06.075
Sitting down here you can feel for anybody in Ankara

37:06.100 --> 37:08.597
or maybe London or anywhere

37:14.513 --> 37:19.206
and if you know how to correct sitting down here,
you can correct that person.

37:26.903 --> 37:30.855
So, in short, is the  scientific language we will  say

37:30.920 --> 37:34.368
that you enter into the subtler side, the

37:34.393 --> 37:37.989
the subtle of subtlest of Ether.

37:48.256 --> 37:53.735
As your chakras get enlightened,
you enter into the subtler side

37:53.760 --> 37:57.034
of all the five elements.

38:09.133 --> 38:14.493
Ultimately the sixth center,
as they call it Agnya chakra,

38:14.518 --> 38:18.473
is once it is  enlightened,

38:18.497 --> 38:22.306
then you become extremely forgiving.

38:32.865 --> 38:35.325
You do not react,

38:37.793 --> 38:40.536
you watch everything like a witness.

38:44.201 --> 38:47.941
Certainly now I see this carpet is very well made,

38:47.973 --> 38:50.610
so normally I should  react.

38:56.260 --> 38:59.828
How much it was have cost from
where did you that buy

38:59.854 --> 39:02.753
who has made it, all these questions will come.

39:10.102 --> 39:13.186
But after the Self Realization

39:13.198 --> 39:16.246
you just watch and enjoy

39:16.271 --> 39:20.377
the creativity of the artist who has made this.

39:31.211 --> 39:34.560
Your quarreling nature also subsides,

39:40.598 --> 39:43.180
because you do not react.

39:47.193 --> 39:52.946
To the last of is  this limbic  area where Kundalini arise

39:52.989 --> 39:59.213
by which you get your peace and joy.

40:12.671 --> 40:16.853
Now Joy is a singular thing,

40:22.141 --> 40:25.053
it is not happiness and unhappiness.

40:28.584 --> 40:30.695
It is just  joy

40:32.507 --> 40:35.935
that means you rises  above your thoughts,

40:35.960 --> 40:41.529
above your mind and you are in complete peace.

40:48.122 --> 40:55.786
For example if you are standing

40:55.848 --> 40:59.881
in the water and the waves are there,
you are  afraid of it.

41:06.128 --> 41:07.992
But in case,

41:08.048 --> 41:12.121
in case , you get into a water,

41:12.171 --> 41:18.414
then you can watch, you can watch  the waves

41:18.472 --> 41:20.813
and enjoy them.

41:29.844 --> 41:33.765
But supposing you know swimming ,

41:33.805 --> 41:37.201
you can jump and save many others.

41:44.866 --> 41:50.269
So now Sahaja yoga is  working
in eighty countries  in the whole world.

41:55.533 --> 41:58.072
and in a very big way.

42:00.698 --> 42:03.585
Some people who got their self realisation

42:03.610 --> 42:06.874
went around and give realization at to others.

42:11.661 --> 42:14.042
For that you do not have to pay

42:16.718 --> 42:19.879
It's a natural process, living process

42:19.981 --> 42:22.346
How much would you pay for that?

42:29.275 --> 42:32.792
So it was without any payment,

42:37.769 --> 42:41.322
that's how the falsehood can be exposed

42:45.925 --> 42:48.686
because you pay for all kinds of falsehood.

42:52.582 --> 42:55.692
Now you can say who has pay for this all.

42:55.717 --> 42:58.790
I must  say  the Sahaja yogis have paid.

43:06.618 --> 43:09.643
Formally I used to pay,

43:12.205 --> 43:15.004
because I have money from my  family

43:15.029 --> 43:16.471
also from my husband.

43:20.515 --> 43:22.357
Now they want to pay.

43:24.009 --> 43:26.893
They  think  for our self realization ,

43:26.918 --> 43:30.536
you are taking this hall, Mother why you should pay?

43:39.719 --> 43:45.797
They can pay for the hall but not for  self realisation.

43:53.496 --> 43:57.268
Then the last center is broken,the seventh One

43:57.301 --> 44:01.413
by which we get connected with this all pervading power.

44:10.732 --> 44:16.862
Which we have not felt so far.
the presence of this all pervading power.

44:23.108 --> 44:31.674
But after self realization you feel it,
this cool breeze, the Ruh (spirit).

44:39.028 --> 44:43.315
In the beginning if very hot,

44:47.252 --> 44:50.867
for that you have to forgive everyone,

44:51.714 --> 44:54.832
not to have anger for anyone.

45:01.106 --> 45:03.470
and it works very easily.

45:06.880 --> 45:11.413
I know there are people here
who want to ask me questions also.

45:15.936 --> 45:20.144
Just now make your questioning mind quite.

45:24.580 --> 45:27.372
First get your self realisation

45:30.218 --> 45:32.630
and then you can ask.

45:35.088 --> 45:40.306
You have to feel this cool breeze on your fingertips.

45:45.638 --> 45:48.399
So have faith in yourself.

45:50.345 --> 45:53.063
And you all  can feel this ruh (spirit).

45:55.734 --> 45:58.338
I assure you ,you can.

46:03.580 --> 46:07.527
[UNCLEAR] hardly five to ten minutes.

46:11.254 --> 46:13.208
I will work it out.

46:16.271 --> 46:20.136
I will request who want to go away ,can go away,

46:20.152 --> 46:22.098
don't disturb others.

46:28.861 --> 46:31.003
I can not force  it only.

46:34.313 --> 46:36.019
You have to ask for it.

46:40.711 --> 46:45.516
If you want to have it,  you can get.

46:49.450 --> 46:52.243
You must have the desire to have it ,

46:57.457 --> 46:59.790
because is pure desire that works.

47:05.900 --> 47:10.054
There is no competition,
no trouble, nothing at all.

47:17.723 --> 47:22.412
Only thing you have to take out your shoes.

47:26.985 --> 47:30.257
Because this Mother Earth is very pure

47:33.759 --> 47:35.761
and she is very helpful.

47:43.354 --> 47:47.068
Can you  wait, Can you wait for a while?

47:50.491 --> 47:52.189
You can do it little later.

47:55.434 --> 47:57.600
Don't disturb this attention

48:01.278 --> 48:02.706
for a while.

48:19.409 --> 48:24.020
I am not going to tell you to do anything whatsoever

48:24.051 --> 48:27.665
I will not even say do not think but automatically

48:27.722 --> 48:30.817
you will  go beyond your mind

48:38.949 --> 48:42.615
and see then said this torsion area.

48:42.658 --> 48:45.483
is called it torsion area.

48:58.063 --> 49:04.977
Alright, Now we have to do like this,
like we do for namaz that's all.

49:10.237 --> 49:11.814
Be comfortable.

49:13.346 --> 49:17.450
Take off your shoes and put both
the  feet away to  each other.

49:27.782 --> 49:35.530
Now  put your right hand on your heart

49:42.975 --> 49:47.883
and ask for forgiveness from God almighty

49:47.908 --> 49:52.259
if we have done anything wrong ,
just to  ask forgive from heart.

50:00.614 --> 50:02.971
But don't  feel guilty.

50:05.675 --> 50:07.603
Mistake can be done

50:07.628 --> 50:10.049
and  now you ask for forgivness,

50:10.057 --> 50:12.995
so do not feel guilty at all

50:16.936 --> 50:25.283
If you feel guilty then this center
on the left hand gets bothered.

50:30.700 --> 50:34.456
And who it is just like
and we are not then coming.

50:48.562 --> 50:54.581
Now please put your right hand  towards me

50:54.679 --> 50:58.619
and put down your head
and see for yourself

50:58.643 --> 51:04.163
is there  any cool or hot breeze
coming out  your head.

51:26.195 --> 51:32.126
Now If  it is hot then you have to forgive,
forgive everyone.

51:37.970 --> 51:41.766
Now please down put
your left hand towards me,

51:41.814 --> 51:44.579
put down your head
and see for yourself

51:44.604 --> 51:50.001
if  there is a cool or  hot  breeze
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

52:04.513 --> 52:08.685
Now please put both
your hands towards me.

52:12.252 --> 52:20.996
Please ,see now if there is a your feeling
the  cool breeze on your fingertips

52:21.021 --> 52:26.700
or on your palm or out of your
fontanel area. Just see it.

52:38.510 --> 52:40.875
This is the ruh.

52:42.218 --> 52:49.763
You can ask a question in your heart ,
is this the ruh  the Divine power?

52:56.943 --> 53:02.944
By asking this ,you will get more  coming [UNCLEAR]

53:08.665 --> 53:11.703
so you can say  also yes this is the ruh

53:11.744 --> 53:15.473
We  have never tried this before ,
this is the ruh.

53:22.878 --> 53:27.153
So you will  feel it warm.

53:30.275 --> 53:33.560
Although who have felt

53:34.088 --> 53:37.986
this cool breeze on their  fingertips,

53:38.083 --> 53:42.428
or on their palm or out of them  fontanel  bone area,

53:42.516 --> 53:44.738
please raise your hands , both hands.

53:57.867 --> 54:00.867
That is what Turkish  people are  wonderful.

54:00.892 --> 54:02.265
May God bless you.

54:06.021 --> 54:09.373
You are specially best people I must say

54:09.495 --> 54:13.721
so easy  to give realisation too.

54:17.551 --> 54:19.351
There is something special.

54:22.088 --> 54:25.184
With the  Europeans  have to break my hands

54:28.797 --> 54:30.186
not with you people.

54:32.027 --> 54:33.811
You are very kind

54:35.359 --> 54:36.742
and sensible,

54:38.719 --> 54:40.536
so may God bless you all.

54:57.105 --> 54:59.485
They want to sing a song for you

54:59.510 --> 55:01.685
and you just clap,all right?

55:01.717 --> 55:05.411
So and you will be amazed ,
this will increase.

55:30.861 --> 55:34.593
Those who have not  felt anything
can come here

55:34.617 --> 55:36.634
and we work it out on them.
