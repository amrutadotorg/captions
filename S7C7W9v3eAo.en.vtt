WEBVTT

03:05.071 --> 03:12.488
Today we have assembled here to celebrate
the birth of Christ.

03:13.950 --> 03:22.317
When you think of His birth one knows that
He was born in a very humble place

03:23.271 --> 03:28.875
and all His life He lived in a very humble
way.

03:31.120 --> 03:39.301
Also, as Sahaja yogis, you know that He was
the incarnation of Shri Ganesha

03:39.478 --> 03:46.474
which is, in essence, is innocence and He
was

03:49.573 --> 03:59.087
crucified due to the stupid understanding
of blind people.

04:01.778 --> 04:08.588
He was the eternal child and it’s so sad
that

04:09.531 --> 04:20.513
when we talk about Christ and Christianity

04:20.714 --> 04:25.565
we feel that Christianity has gone just
the other way around,

04:25.766 --> 04:29.744
on the other side of Christ.

04:29.945 --> 04:34.965
If one is construction, the another is
destruction

04:36.284 --> 04:41.046
and if one is innocence, another is cunning.

04:41.247 --> 04:47.930
If you see the Christian nations, it's very
surprising where we have got Christianity

04:48.131 --> 04:56.097
in its practice; it's very surprising that
innocence has no place, no respect,

04:56.298 --> 05:05.105
chastity has no place, no respect, which
was the essence of Christ,

05:05.306 --> 05:09.305
He was made of it.

05:12.926 --> 05:19.039
It is sometimes shocking how these so-called
Christian nations

05:19.239 --> 05:23.176
have maligned Christ to that extent

05:25.623 --> 05:30.549
and how they have ruined so many people
with their stupid ideas

05:30.750 --> 05:37.813
of allowing people to indulge into all kinds
of filthy things.

05:39.457 --> 05:44.042
And the second point is very important,
to see how

05:44.243 --> 05:49.213
He was born in a very humble abode,

05:49.414 --> 05:53.406
He lived in a very humble way.

05:53.971 --> 05:59.669
He was a son of a carpenter so He lived
like a carpenter,

06:03.362 --> 06:10.331
but in the Western life people are so
materialistic

06:10.532 --> 06:16.615
and to them to live lavishly, to show off
their wealth

06:16.816 --> 06:22.016
and to plunder people, plunder countries
after countries

06:22.217 --> 06:26.868
for material gain is a common thing.

06:27.069 --> 06:35.319
They do not feel also that it is wrong and
they are quite proud of it.

06:35.520 --> 06:41.173
And the third great thing about Christ was
that

06:41.374 --> 06:47.967
He wanted people to love each other and
to be humble,

06:48.168 --> 06:56.450
but the arrogance and the cruelty that one
has seen of the Christian nations

06:56.651 --> 07:03.871
one cannot understand how are they anywhere
near Christ.

07:04.889 --> 07:10.672
He has said about, "Blessed are those who
are meek".

07:10.873 --> 07:16.591
Where are those meek people living? Not
in the western countries,

07:16.792 --> 07:21.992
not in the countries where Christ is
worshipped, where temples are raised,

07:22.193 --> 07:30.286
are raised in His honor and have been
worshipping the Mother for so many years.

07:30.487 --> 07:35.890
What a sinful thing it is to do to Christ.

07:36.336 --> 07:42.692
Is the greatest sin that we say that we are
following Christ

07:42.893 --> 07:46.151
and to do all these horrible things,

07:46.333 --> 07:52.247
all such people have to go to hell
of the worst type, no doubt about it.

07:52.448 --> 07:56.025
They may not realize but they are already
getting into it,

07:56.194 --> 07:59.540
they are already having this problem.

07:59.741 --> 08:05.284
They are worse than people who crucified
Christ, this is every-day crucifixion.

08:05.485 --> 08:10.963
So it's a great occasion today to celebrate

08:11.164 --> 08:17.209
the birth of Christ, who came on this earth
to help us in our resurrection,

08:17.410 --> 08:21.243
to talk about the Holy Ghost.

08:21.943 --> 08:27.590
He was bearing all the brunt of the people,
everything,

08:27.791 --> 08:32.641
but the outcome of that life is so
horrifying that sometimes I get worried

08:32.842 --> 08:37.448
that I hope they don't make something out
of Me like that.

08:37.649 --> 08:42.926
It is such a stupid ideas people have
in the west,

08:43.127 --> 08:48.675
that for any sensible man he can see the way

08:48.876 --> 08:56.569
they are emotional, romantic, nonsensical.
They have no respect

08:57.245 --> 09:01.812
for themselves and to follow Christ with
that kind of an attitude is, I think is,

09:02.013 --> 09:08.009
they have no business, they have no right,
but it has happened.

09:08.210 --> 09:14.872
Now you people are born again as Christ
has said, "You are to be born again".

09:15.073 --> 09:20.868
You have achieved that state which Christ
was talking about.

09:21.069 --> 09:27.722
You are the special type of people. I never
had such hopes I must say.

09:27.923 --> 09:33.936
The first encounter was so horrible that I
didn't think that many will come out of it

09:34.137 --> 09:37.544
but so many of you have come out of it

09:37.745 --> 09:44.339
and have really glorified the name of
Christ, no doubt about it, and keep it up.

09:44.540 --> 09:47.454
I would request you now to know that you
are Sahaja yogis

09:47.655 --> 09:50.864
and that you are the followers of Christ.

09:51.065 --> 09:56.056
You are the Gnostics as described, you are
the ones who know

09:56.257 --> 10:01.911
and that's how you have to help people
to emancipate.

10:02.112 --> 10:10.352
It is very surprising that I saw that
the Western life,

10:10.553 --> 10:19.397
the stupid, destructive ideas, did not kill
the innocence.

10:19.598 --> 10:28.178
Like the clouds, all these affectations
were there

10:28.379 --> 10:33.331
but once the Kundalini rose the innocence
started expressing itself.

10:33.532 --> 10:42.419
But still, I would say that this kind
of lovey-dovey stuff

10:42.620 --> 10:48.831
must be given up. It is just most
un-Christian

10:49.032 --> 10:54.657
because if you see His life, it was a life
of a tapasvi,

10:54.858 --> 11:02.400
a man who lived in a very detached manner,
in nisanga.

11:02.601 --> 11:06.952
So for Sahaja yogis who are coming from
Christian life

11:07.153 --> 11:11.579
have to understand if they have to get rid
of it, they should be like that.

11:11.780 --> 11:16.327
But on the contrary, see the interest
in marriages,

11:16.528 --> 11:23.646
the interest in all this kind of thing and
after marriage - is a bit too much.

11:25.918 --> 11:30.947
It is so much in it, I mean it’s absurd,
it's absurd in Sahaja Yoga.

11:31.148 --> 11:38.637
It's one of the lifestyles, is alright, one
of the part, it's not everything;

11:38.838 --> 11:44.430
and it covers the whole entire personality
of a Christian personality.

11:44.631 --> 11:50.665
Not with Muslims or Hindus, I've seen that.
I mean, I'm married too.

11:50.866 --> 11:57.666
But it doesn't cover My whole entire being
with it. How can it?

11:57.867 --> 12:02.530
And that's the problem is - that once
marriage system starts, anything starts,

12:02.731 --> 12:07.828
“oh it becomes so important” and I'm faced
with problems all the time.

12:08.029 --> 12:11.050
The marriage is performed then letters will
be coming,

12:11.251 --> 12:13.992
“this has happened to my marriage”.
They must get married,

12:14.193 --> 12:17.059
nobody is such that, supposing now one is
finished,

12:17.268 --> 12:22.724
live without marriage, they cannot do it,
just can't live.

12:22.925 --> 12:26.171
Christ never got married.

12:26.372 --> 12:31.643
They cannot have that tapasvita in them
and they depend so much,

12:31.844 --> 12:35.307
they'll ruin their wives, they'll ruin
their husbands, they'll ruin Sahaja Yoga.

12:35.508 --> 12:38.243
They'll take them away - but it's something
surprising -

12:38.444 --> 12:45.383
the importance of Sahaja Yoga is so
minimized by this Christian mind,

12:45.901 --> 12:51.451
[that?] I don't know from where these ideas
have come to you.

12:53.477 --> 13:00.542
It's a juxtaposition as you can call it,
juxtaposition.

13:00.743 --> 13:06.188
There is no similarity between the life
Christ must have thought

13:06.389 --> 13:09.256
people would lead and the people are
leading.

13:09.480 --> 13:15.603
So it is necessary for Sahaja yogis to have
a dignity and a sense

13:15.804 --> 13:18.552
and to know that they are grounded
in Sahaja Yoga

13:18.753 --> 13:26.630
and marriage and all those things are just
subsidiary. It's not the end of life.

13:27.637 --> 13:33.452
And when I see that happening I am rather
surprised in Sahaja Yoga

13:33.653 --> 13:39.647
I have to marry people because I believe
that one should lead a proper married life.

13:39.848 --> 13:44.766
Because if you just take up a sanyasa
without going through this married life,

13:44.967 --> 13:49.147
you can be very much hypocritical.

13:49.348 --> 13:53.758
But that doesn't mean that marriage is
everything.

13:53.959 --> 14:00.725
It's not so important, it's just something
has to happen.

14:00.926 --> 14:05.252
It's not even important than any puja;

14:05.453 --> 14:10.998
it's not even important than praying to Me;

14:11.199 --> 14:15.163
it's not even important than meditating;

14:15.364 --> 14:22.214
it's not important at all than even eating
your food.

14:23.860 --> 14:28.173
The more I know you start making of it
you fall into the same trap

14:28.374 --> 14:31.541
from where I pulled you out.

14:32.398 --> 14:40.098
So as I, the other day I was telling people
about what they have to do

14:40.299 --> 14:48.337
about these caste system we have in India.
So in the society of Sahaja yogis,

14:48.538 --> 14:54.096
it should be only a one day affair or two
day affair at the most.

14:54.709 --> 15:00.165
But so much importance, husband, wives,
getting married,

15:00.358 --> 15:05.744
then solving their problems, I get
a headache with them.

15:05.945 --> 15:08.925
And they'll always come "my wife, you know,
she's like this,

15:09.126 --> 15:12.923
and wife's sister like that, and wife's
this".

15:13.124 --> 15:17.109
I mean, one should be ashamed even to say
that "my wife".

15:17.310 --> 15:23.074
In India nobody says like that. I don't
think anybody will say "my wife".

15:23.275 --> 15:29.097
It's not done. At the most they'll say
"my children's mother",

15:29.298 --> 15:34.802
and if you have no children you don't say
anything.

15:36.931 --> 15:44.534
So this is the doom from which you have
come out. Please try to understand.

15:45.480 --> 15:50.837
From hell we have come out, absolutely
wrong ideas we had,

15:51.006 --> 15:59.478
from there we have come out, now be
dignified, be sensible.

16:00.369 --> 16:05.074
An over-importance to such un-important
thing

16:05.275 --> 16:09.200
will not allow you to rise very high
in life.

16:09.401 --> 16:11.547
But I don't say you don't marry, you must
marry.

16:11.748 --> 16:17.681
Of course, if you have a Sahaja yogini who
is also a good Sahaja yogini and she knows

16:17.882 --> 16:23.069
about Sahaja Yoga and then of course you
are helped much more, definitely.

16:23.237 --> 16:30.657
You get much more power, much more
understanding, much more joy

16:30.858 --> 16:36.554
and it's very good but the entire
relationship is so important

16:36.755 --> 16:42.827
on small, small things, this is just beyond
Me to understand.

16:43.028 --> 16:48.055
Then I see that then the girls fall in love
with the man whom they marry, finished;

16:48.256 --> 16:51.756
the man is finished, the woman is finished.

16:52.401 --> 16:59.544
Today I am taking this great occasion
to tell you

16:59.745 --> 17:05.634
that Christ was born to Immaculata;

17:09.913 --> 17:15.345
and that's how I have given you your second
birth

17:17.069 --> 17:20.554
and you are so pure.

17:21.133 --> 17:26.111
So all the impurities, you must see them
clearly.

17:26.312 --> 17:33.289
I know you don't like them but they still
creep from here and there.

17:33.490 --> 17:38.442
Of course if the society you see in the west
is a society which

17:38.643 --> 17:41.828
of course there is no family, no wife,
nothing of the kind,

17:42.029 --> 17:46.672
so it's just slightly better than that -
but again you get stuck.

17:46.873 --> 17:51.588
If you have to come up to this stage, you
have to give up the staircase.

17:51.784 --> 17:55.555
You think that you have achieved a lot
because now you have a settled family

17:55.756 --> 18:00.488
and settled children and you are only worried
about your own children all the time.

18:00.689 --> 18:09.489
No, it's another temptation; it's [a] very
big temptation.

18:11.632 --> 18:20.002
So on the great occasion of the birth
of Christ we have to say to ourselves

18:20.203 --> 18:26.651
that we are dedicated to Sahaja Yoga,

18:28.558 --> 18:34.221
that's the main thing, everything is
subsidiary.

18:35.716 --> 18:41.524
I hope you'll understand that we are now

18:41.725 --> 18:45.726
on the cusp of a wave from where we are
going to jump onto another wave,

18:45.927 --> 18:51.305
which will be much higher than this, but
you must have the worthiness.

18:51.506 --> 18:56.294
If you are not sea-worthy you’ll be
drowned,

18:58.320 --> 19:02.782
so we have to develop that worthiness -
and we have Christ before us.

19:02.983 --> 19:07.111
What a life, what a life it was.

19:07.312 --> 19:12.480
He lived like a human being in a humble
way and what a life.

19:12.681 --> 19:21.709
And how truthfully forthright He was to say
everything so clearly.

19:21.910 --> 19:24.583
In the same way you'll have your strength

19:24.784 --> 19:28.652
when you will know that you are much more
than a married man

19:28.853 --> 19:33.982
and you are much more than your nationality.

19:34.183 --> 19:37.589
You are a higher personality,

19:37.790 --> 19:44.150
a Sahaja yogi who is dwelling in the bliss
of the Kingdom of God.

19:44.351 --> 19:51.356
That's the bliss, not the family bliss and
the children bliss, but the bliss of God.

19:51.557 --> 19:54.654
May God bless you.
