WEBVTT

00:12.016 --> 00:16.281
Yesterday I told you

00:17.664 --> 00:20.258
that we have within us

00:20.531 --> 00:23.620
two very important powers.

00:23.821 --> 00:27.487
The first power is the power of desire

00:27.688 --> 00:29.762
by which we desire,

00:29.962 --> 00:32.521
called as “iccha shakti” in Sanskrit language

00:32.721 --> 00:36.923
and another power which is called

00:37.782 --> 00:42.949
as the “kriya power,” or we can say the power of action.

00:43.817 --> 00:46.371
These two are really gross powers

00:46.637 --> 00:49.050
which are expressed outside

00:49.332 --> 00:52.855
as sympathetic nervous system.

00:54.293 --> 00:57.347
Left and Right sympathetic nervous system.

00:57.548 --> 01:01.495
The central path is called

01:01.696 --> 01:07.057
the “Sushumna Nadi,” the channel of our ascent.

01:07.258 --> 01:13.247
This channel represents our evolution through ages.

01:14.348 --> 01:17.270
We can say that this channel is responsible

01:17.497 --> 01:19.702
for giving us our evolution

01:19.903 --> 01:24.028
from amoeba to this stage as a human being.

01:24.574 --> 01:27.160
And all the centers that you see there

01:27.395 --> 01:30.906
– one, two, three, four, five, six and seven -

01:31.106 --> 01:35.496
– all of them are the milestones in our progress,

01:35.887 --> 01:38.374
in our evolution.

01:38.575 --> 01:40.719
These are all placed within us

01:40.919 --> 01:44.109
the subtle centers are there, they are all there

01:44.309 --> 01:48.387
and we are made up of this beautiful instrument.

01:48.746 --> 01:51.785
We are not aware of it, of course we are not aware.

01:51.986 --> 01:54.749
Also we can’t see them because they are subtle centers

01:54.949 --> 01:58.368
and we cannot see with our naked eyes.

01:58.720 --> 02:01.779
We can only see the manifestation of these centers outside

02:01.980 --> 02:04.145
as gross plexuses.

02:04.345 --> 02:06.186
Now today, as I told you yesterday,

02:06.386 --> 02:09.394
I will be dealing with each center one by one

02:09.595 --> 02:14.085
and I will tell you what these centers represent within us.

02:14.546 --> 02:20.491
The very first center is the center of our innocence.

02:22.310 --> 02:25.187
Before creating us, before creating this universe,

02:25.397 --> 02:27.110
innocence was created.

02:27.310 --> 02:30.841
Innocence is the most powerful power on this earth.

02:31.044 --> 02:34.122
Innocence is Love, innocence is God

02:34.322 --> 02:38.474
and innocence is the only thing that really

02:38.674 --> 02:44.392
keeps us going in this horrible world in which we are born.

02:44.868 --> 02:50.703
This innocence we find in the matter.

02:51.078 --> 02:52.886
Matter is innocent.

02:53.086 --> 02:55.417
If you hit the matter it will hit you.

02:55.617 --> 02:57.468
If you don’t hit it, it is all right.

02:57.669 --> 02:59.770
You can change the form of the matter.

02:59.971 --> 03:04.819
You see, say for example, this hall - it won’t trouble you.

03:05.020 --> 03:06.937
If you are here it will give you shade.

03:07.137 --> 03:10.084
If you want you can use it for

03:10.285 --> 03:12.777
disturbing others, for destroying others.

03:12.996 --> 03:14.847
The way you want to use it, you can use it,

03:15.048 --> 03:16.989
because it doesn’t say anything to us.

03:17.189 --> 03:20.238
So at this center is the carbon element

03:20.439 --> 03:22.036
which started doing within us.

03:22.236 --> 03:24.708
We can say the carbon is in the center

03:24.908 --> 03:29.298
of the whole

03:29.853 --> 03:31.611
system of elements.

03:31.811 --> 03:33.958
Carbon is in the center

03:34.158 --> 03:36.966
because it is a tetravalent element.

03:37.166 --> 03:39.294
As you know it has got four valencies

03:39.494 --> 03:44.599
and when carbon came in this existence,

03:44.799 --> 03:47.028
then only life would be produced

03:47.228 --> 03:49.349
and this center is thus,

03:49.549 --> 03:52.689
is the center where we became really tetravalent –

03:52.923 --> 03:57.431
means we became an element

03:57.632 --> 03:59.899
by which we could become human beings.

04:00.100 --> 04:02.989
We could become the living things.

04:03.189 --> 04:07.145
The living things started when carbon came into existence.

04:07.345 --> 04:10.318
So this center is very important

04:10.519 --> 04:14.720
because this center represents that stage of human evolution

04:14.920 --> 04:17.286
where we became living human beings.

04:17.487 --> 04:19.631
Before this we were dead people,

04:19.831 --> 04:24.240
we were just like these stones and things that you see around.

04:24.440 --> 04:26.822
After that -

04:27.023 --> 04:31.389
I told you about this center yesterday -

04:31.589 --> 04:35.080
After that you have the second center of our seeking.

04:35.280 --> 04:40.056
When an animal came into being he started seeking.

04:40.256 --> 04:42.627
First he started seeking the food.

04:42.827 --> 04:46.850
For example the unicellular animals like amoeba and all that

04:47.077 --> 04:48.369
they just seek food.

04:48.569 --> 04:51.064
They do not seek anything else but food

04:51.264 --> 04:54.908
and that is the beginning of our seeking.

04:55.108 --> 04:57.997
So the first, grossest seeking was food,

04:58.197 --> 05:03.338
where we started seeking something for our growth,

05:03.546 --> 05:05.987
for our nutrition.

05:06.187 --> 05:10.432
The second seeking started when some of the animals

05:10.632 --> 05:13.573
felt that they were too big for their sizes,

05:13.773 --> 05:17.096
they couldn’t move around and they found it impossible

05:17.297 --> 05:19.304
to do something about it.

05:19.547 --> 05:23.331
Now we can say, that even before these animals were made,

05:23.531 --> 05:27.648
before that the fishes themselves

05:28.031 --> 05:30.055
were surrounded by land

05:30.255 --> 05:32.364
and one of the fishes had to come up,

05:32.565 --> 05:35.883
the future that was going to happen.

05:36.083 --> 05:40.360
In these chaotic conditions and confusions,

05:40.560 --> 05:43.368
we started seeking more and more,

05:43.568 --> 05:47.011
and the real seeking is that of beyond.

05:47.261 --> 05:50.741
Of course we must say

05:50.941 --> 05:54.139
that the play of the seeking is not only human.

05:54.339 --> 05:56.202
There is also God’s play.

05:56.402 --> 05:59.389
It is God who wants you to seek.

05:59.589 --> 06:03.386
It is God who wants you to get your realization.

06:03.605 --> 06:06.257
You are the epitome of his creation.

06:06.457 --> 06:08.608
Human beings are the height that he has created.

06:08.808 --> 06:10.574
Do you see how beautifully He has created

06:10.774 --> 06:13.858
in thousands of years from amoeba, from carbon,

06:14.058 --> 06:18.232
say, from a hydrogen atom you have become like this?

06:18.433 --> 06:21.467
There must be some purpose, some reason

06:21.667 --> 06:23.952
why God has made you like this.

06:24.152 --> 06:29.112
It’s not just a wasteful, purposeless activity of God.

06:29.313 --> 06:32.182
But what is the purpose of God? Why did he do it?

06:32.383 --> 06:33.613
Nobody thinks about it.

06:33.813 --> 06:35.566
Scientists, of course, they being honest,

06:35.766 --> 06:38.113
they say we cannot find out so forget about it.

06:38.313 --> 06:42.465
Whatever they cannot find out and reason out they just don’t discuss.

06:42.665 --> 06:44.449
So one has to see

06:44.649 --> 06:47.207
whether there is some reason or not,

06:47.407 --> 06:49.273
or is there any purpose in our life,

06:49.474 --> 06:52.332
or are we to come on this Earth and just to die

06:52.532 --> 06:54.338
like any other animal

06:54.539 --> 06:59.945
and have no gains in our human awareness?

07:00.805 --> 07:06.291
This question has been arising into the minds of thousands of people

07:06.492 --> 07:10.305
and at this time as you know the market was full with the idea

07:10.505 --> 07:11.872
that we have to seek.

07:12.072 --> 07:13.822
So the market got flooded

07:14.023 --> 07:17.431
with all kinds of people who wanted to market it.

07:17.650 --> 07:20.470
I mean, it's automatic.

07:20.720 --> 07:23.128
There are marketeers for everything.

07:23.348 --> 07:26.484
You want something? You will find marketeers just coming around

07:26.684 --> 07:28.280
and that’s how it happened

07:28.480 --> 07:32.161
and they took advantage of the simplicity

07:32.361 --> 07:38.284
and of the naîvity of the people and they misused them

07:38.806 --> 07:40.679
and misled them.

07:40.879 --> 07:42.570
They could not understand

07:42.770 --> 07:47.155
how God can be organized by these people,

07:47.356 --> 07:49.489
whether they were the contractors of God

07:49.708 --> 07:51.601
or how could they talk of God,

07:51.801 --> 07:54.996
what was the sign and symptom of a person

07:55.215 --> 07:57.523
who comes to you and says that I am God

07:57.723 --> 08:01.644
and you should receive these things from me.

08:02.630 --> 08:06.786
What we believe in was superficial

08:08.301 --> 08:10.406
superficial appearances.

08:10.606 --> 08:13.074
Like a person has 58 Rolls Royces.

08:13.324 --> 08:17.199
He must be a great man, not a saint.

08:17.527 --> 08:20.218
The saint doesn’t have any Rolls Royces.

08:20.418 --> 08:21.787
We could not see that.

08:21.988 --> 08:26.015
For us it was very much great that he lives in a big mansion.

08:26.215 --> 08:27.703
Not the saint.

08:27.903 --> 08:30.578
The Saint doesn’t want mansions. He can live on the street.

08:30.778 --> 08:32.928
For him it does not matter whether it’s a mansion or a street,

08:33.129 --> 08:34.717
makes no difference to him.

08:34.941 --> 08:39.256
This is the simple thing that they did not know about a saint

08:39.456 --> 08:41.399
and they got impressed by all these things,

08:41.599 --> 08:46.317
by media and the way they put up the show and circus that they can.

08:46.996 --> 08:49.195
This is the sadest part of the whole story

08:49.396 --> 08:52.679
and that’s how our seeking was misled.

08:53.016 --> 08:57.039
Today I would like to say about this chakra especially

08:57.344 --> 09:00.159
that is what we call the “Nabhi Chakra,”

09:00.359 --> 09:03.149
is the central path of our evolution

09:03.377 --> 09:05.220
where you start your seeking

09:05.421 --> 09:08.735
and you crossover to the other side.

09:08.939 --> 09:12.223
Now surrounding this you will find there is

09:12.423 --> 09:15.993
the ocean of illusion

09:16.416 --> 09:22.345
and this ocean of illusion was governed by a deity,

09:23.861 --> 09:28.133
by a special powerful personality

09:28.493 --> 09:32.484
whom we call as “Dattatreya,” is the Primordial Master

09:32.758 --> 09:35.500
and he incarnated on this Earth many a times.

09:35.714 --> 09:38.508
At the time of Christ, and even before that,

09:38.743 --> 09:44.574
he incarnated as, say, Abraham, Moses, Socrates, Lao Tze.

09:44.774 --> 09:47.496
Later on he incarnated as Mohammad Sahab,

09:47.696 --> 09:51.633
then the same great principle incarnated as Nanaka,

09:51.867 --> 09:55.523
then the same principle at the last incarnated as

09:55.750 --> 09:58.578
Sainath of Shirdi.

09:58.922 --> 10:02.486
So the same great principle

10:02.687 --> 10:05.766
of this Primordial Master has incarnated

10:06.023 --> 10:08.128
because without a master,

10:08.328 --> 10:12.729
how will you be taken away from this illusion?

10:12.929 --> 10:15.530
How we are you going to be exposed

10:15.739 --> 10:19.625
to that reality which you do not feel?

10:19.825 --> 10:22.039
What has to happen to you

10:22.239 --> 10:25.301
is that you have to become more sensitive,

10:25.569 --> 10:28.736
more open, awakened and enlightened

10:28.936 --> 10:32.970
to feel that all-pervading power around you.

10:33.170 --> 10:36.455
These masters came again and again and told you,

10:36.655 --> 10:38.900
that you must look after your “Dharma.”

10:39.100 --> 10:40.922
Dharma doesn’t mean any religion

10:41.123 --> 10:43.426
that is being established in the names of these people.

10:43.638 --> 10:46.920
Because human beings know how to make a pickle out of everyone.

10:47.120 --> 10:48.712
They are great experts.

10:48.912 --> 10:52.360
All of them in essence are one and the same.

10:52.560 --> 10:56.062
But like flowers on the same tree can be taken away

10:56.263 --> 10:59.180
from time to time and when they become ugly

10:59.380 --> 11:01.227
and they become completely spoilt

11:01.427 --> 11:04.408
then people can claim this is my flower, this is my flower.

11:04.608 --> 11:07.808
Everybody has become a contractor of this thing.

11:08.037 --> 11:11.193
Actually these people belong to the whole universe,

11:11.394 --> 11:14.007
they are universal beings and they came on this earth

11:14.207 --> 11:16.827
to give us a sustenance within us.

11:17.027 --> 11:19.345
Sustenance, Dharma means a sustenance,

11:19.546 --> 11:24.624
this quality that is human.

11:24.824 --> 11:28.065
For example, gold has a quality

11:28.332 --> 11:30.053
that it is untarnishable.

11:30.253 --> 11:33.108
Carbon has a quality that it is tetravalent.

11:33.308 --> 11:37.650
In the same way, human beings have ten valencies

11:37.850 --> 11:43.701
or, we can say, they have a quality of having these ten

11:44.311 --> 11:48.317
specialities in them so that they can be called as human beings.

11:48.518 --> 11:51.180
All these ten specialities are represented

11:51.380 --> 11:56.344
by the ten incarnations of this Primordial Spirit on this Earth.

11:56.544 --> 11:58.930
There are many other Spirits who came

11:59.130 --> 12:03.028
who are followers or, we can say, the disciples

12:04.677 --> 12:07.421
incarnations of this great power

12:07.622 --> 12:09.853
which we call as the Primordial Master.

12:10.053 --> 12:12.624
And such a Primordial Master is needed no doubt

12:12.825 --> 12:16.734
but such a Primordial Master has to have certain qualities.

12:16.934 --> 12:20.918
If they are missing, how is he going to be our master?

12:21.591 --> 12:24.070
A guru means a person

12:24.270 --> 12:27.560
who has got that weight in him,

12:27.760 --> 12:32.679
weight of virtues, of qualities, of righteousness, of holiness.

12:32.879 --> 12:35.468
A person who is not righteous, who is a parasite,

12:35.668 --> 12:39.262
who leads a bad life cannot be your guru.

12:39.489 --> 12:43.305
Not only that but what is a guru’s speciality is

12:43.505 --> 12:45.843
that he makes you meet God,

12:46.043 --> 12:47.570
he connects you to God.

12:47.770 --> 12:50.664
He doesn’t connect you to all kinds of funny things

12:50.864 --> 12:53.301
that these gurus are doing nowadays.

12:53.501 --> 12:58.176
On this point I have to tell you how the false people work it out

12:58.376 --> 13:01.446
and how the reality works out.

13:01.808 --> 13:07.277
Now if you see on the right hand side of this lies

13:07.480 --> 13:12.836
the power of your kriya shakti, as your “action power.”

13:13.036 --> 13:15.095
Now what they do is they tell you

13:15.295 --> 13:18.554
that you start doing some sort of a jumping,

13:18.754 --> 13:20.795
standing on your head or they may say

13:20.996 --> 13:22.101
that take out your tongue.

13:22.301 --> 13:24.044
There was a guru here, now he doesn’t do that,

13:24.263 --> 13:27.736
he is dead – but what he did in his lifetime,

13:27.936 --> 13:29.954
he asked people to cut the tongue

13:30.154 --> 13:32.134
at the base and put the tongue back

13:32.334 --> 13:33.822
and do some sort of a trick,

13:34.022 --> 13:38.225
I don’t know what he called it, a... “khechari.”

13:38.452 --> 13:40.986
All these nonsensical things people started doing,

13:41.186 --> 13:42.962
to push your eyes down like that,

13:43.162 --> 13:45.812
or to stand on your head,

13:46.013 --> 13:51.099
stand on one leg and do all kinds of these tricks.

13:52.007 --> 13:53.916
You cannot go to God.

13:54.116 --> 13:55.846
This is not the way to be done.

13:56.046 --> 13:57.861
This is not the way you can get to God.

13:58.061 --> 14:00.447
It’s sahaja, It’s spontaneous.

14:00.647 --> 14:02.635
It’s a process that is living.

14:02.835 --> 14:04.971
It cannot work out by these tricks

14:05.171 --> 14:07.377
that people tell you - do this, do that.

14:07.577 --> 14:10.125
This is not the way it is going to work out. Remember!

14:10.325 --> 14:11.742
It will only work out

14:11.942 --> 14:16.031
if there is a spontaneous happening of Kundalini awakening

14:16.231 --> 14:18.711
which is the Holy Mother you have got.

14:18.911 --> 14:21.365
She is an auspicious Mother, She is the Holy Mother.

14:21.565 --> 14:26.083
She is not unholy and you cannot use it for any unholy purpose.

14:26.283 --> 14:28.701
Now we have lost the meaning of the word holy.

14:28.901 --> 14:34.435
We have lost the meaning of the word auspiciousness.

14:34.635 --> 14:36.277
We do not know what righteousness is.

14:36.478 --> 14:39.585
In these modern times these words sound so hollow and so funny.

14:39.785 --> 14:44.582
But you will be amazed that this exists within us

14:44.782 --> 14:46.510
whether you like it or not.

14:46.711 --> 14:51.059
If we do not get the blessings of holiness,

14:51.259 --> 14:54.410
you cannot raise the Kundalini.

14:54.610 --> 14:57.465
Kundalini is a spontaneous thing,

14:57.665 --> 15:01.196
is just like a seed that sprouts in the Mother Earth.

15:01.422 --> 15:04.338
In the same way when the warmth of holiness

15:04.539 --> 15:08.245
and auspiciousness is faced by a person,

15:08.445 --> 15:10.904
then only the Kundalini is going to rise.

15:11.104 --> 15:12.685
So any guru who comes and tells you

15:12.886 --> 15:15.653
that I give you a realization, you stand on your head, You tell him,

15:15.854 --> 15:18.990
“You better go on stand untill you get your realization.”

15:19.190 --> 15:20.740
Then there are many other things they’ll tell you.

15:20.940 --> 15:23.201
They say that you will start flying.

15:23.401 --> 15:27.299
Now we have to understand all these nonsensical things,

15:27.651 --> 15:30.514
why do we want to do? Why do we want to fly in the air?

15:30.714 --> 15:32.232
You are already flying a bit too much.

15:32.432 --> 15:35.514
Just now I was coming in the sky, I saw so many aeroplanes

15:35.714 --> 15:37.123
that I thought a day may come

15:37.323 --> 15:40.303
when you will have to find some sort of a method

15:40.503 --> 15:44.203
of arranging the crossing of these aeroplanes

15:44.403 --> 15:48.026
and how the traffic has to be arranged even there.

15:48.331 --> 15:51.220
Now all such ideas that we are going to fly

15:51.420 --> 15:54.423
or somebody says that we become sort of

15:54.623 --> 15:57.306
a person who leaves the body and goes up

15:57.506 --> 15:59.110
and sees from there.

15:59.310 --> 16:03.259
Or somebody who sees the colors or who sees the auras.

16:03.459 --> 16:07.677
All these things seeing you can do otherwise.

16:08.240 --> 16:10.340
It is not a seeing

16:10.540 --> 16:12.633
that is important. As I told you yesterday,

16:12.834 --> 16:17.303
saying that this is the Truth – there are many who say this is the Truth.

16:18.120 --> 16:20.223
You have to become the Truth.

16:20.423 --> 16:22.680
There is a second thing you have to know today

16:22.880 --> 16:25.344
that by seeing something you do not become.

16:25.544 --> 16:29.585
If you see something – suppose if you are coming by this road.

16:29.786 --> 16:32.147
We saw this church.

16:32.348 --> 16:35.793
But when we came in we don’t see it now.

16:36.176 --> 16:40.500
When you are away from it, when we crossed the mountain,

16:40.700 --> 16:42.695
we never saw it.

16:42.895 --> 16:44.601
When we are honest, we never saw it.

16:44.801 --> 16:46.812
When we were away from it then we saw it.

16:47.012 --> 16:50.828
So seeing something is not receiving that,

16:51.028 --> 16:53.133
is not to be.

16:53.333 --> 16:55.687
To be means in your awareness, as I said

16:55.888 --> 16:58.864
in your central nervous system you must feel

16:59.123 --> 17:01.868
that you have become the Spirit.

17:02.068 --> 17:04.244
Yesterday I told you about the Spirit

17:04.444 --> 17:07.546
and what are the blessings of the Spirit and how you get it.

17:07.747 --> 17:10.159
But if your dharma is not all right –

17:10.363 --> 17:12.577
supposing you have moved too much to the right side.

17:12.777 --> 17:15.428
Even a person who is a very busy man,

17:15.628 --> 17:17.973
he is running the rat race, he has no time for God,

17:18.173 --> 17:21.370
he has no time for his Spirit, nothing, he is running very fast.

17:21.574 --> 17:27.087
Alright, you run fast and jump into the place where you have to go.

17:28.358 --> 17:30.873
You have to be in the center.

17:31.076 --> 17:34.271
Not extreme action

17:35.498 --> 17:38.635
can take you to your real path.

17:38.836 --> 17:43.184
If you take a car for example – In your practical life

17:43.384 --> 17:45.374
you always try to keep everything in the center

17:45.574 --> 17:48.397
in the sense your car cannot run on one-sided wheels.

17:48.597 --> 17:50.499
It has to have both the wheels.

17:50.699 --> 17:54.060
On a chair you cannot sit if it has only two legs,

17:54.261 --> 17:56.432
on one side you cannot sit.

17:56.682 --> 18:00.146
Our center of gravity acts in the center.

18:00.412 --> 18:03.939
In our normal life we keep to the center.

18:04.139 --> 18:06.854
We cannot walk with one side like this.

18:07.054 --> 18:09.251
We have to put both the legs on the ground

18:09.451 --> 18:11.258
and walk on both the legs.

18:11.458 --> 18:14.942
In the same way if you try to act on one side,

18:15.162 --> 18:18.508
as I told you yesterday you can create a terrible imbalance.

18:18.708 --> 18:20.460
Especially in dharma it happens

18:20.661 --> 18:22.163
and that’s why I am telling you today

18:22.363 --> 18:26.996
that any extreme behavior on dharma is not needed.

18:27.238 --> 18:31.010
There is no need to go on madly calling, “God, oh God, come along,“

18:31.210 --> 18:32.893
people are saying mantras now.

18:33.128 --> 18:35.177
Any sort of mantra they take.

18:35.378 --> 18:38.085
There is one guru who charges three hundred pounds

18:38.285 --> 18:40.859
and the mantra he gives means -

18:41.059 --> 18:42.847
in Hindi word called as “thinga.”

18:43.047 --> 18:46.395
When you show like this [Shri Mataji shows her right-hand thumb] that is it.

18:46.609 --> 18:49.987
So many people are doing it, paying 300 pounds.

18:50.188 --> 18:52.948
You tell any Indian and he will just laugh.

18:53.148 --> 18:54.683
How can it be?  “Inga”,

18:54.884 --> 18:58.944
“Inga” in Marathi language means the tail of a scorpion.

18:59.164 --> 19:00.925
These are the mantras they are giving to you,

19:01.125 --> 19:03.359
and you are paying three hundred pounds for that.

19:03.579 --> 19:07.114
Now the mantra cannot be given like that.

19:07.314 --> 19:10.919
It’s a wrong idea that you give some mantra to somebody.

19:11.119 --> 19:15.188
For example, every center has a different mantra.

19:15.400 --> 19:18.348
Every center has got a problem,

19:18.548 --> 19:21.222
when the Kundalini rises you know.

19:21.447 --> 19:26.098
When you come, say, to the center of Shri Krishna,

19:26.298 --> 19:28.551
now you have to take the name of Shri Krishna.

19:28.751 --> 19:32.405
If you come to the center of the gurus, of the Adiguru,

19:32.606 --> 19:36.852
of the sat gurus, then you have to take the names of satgurus.

19:37.052 --> 19:42.024
Satguru means the one who is the real master.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.704
Then you have to take their names.

19:43.904 --> 19:48.583
But if you are taking the name of some one person...

19:48.783 --> 19:51.551
for example say we take the name of Rama.

19:51.751 --> 19:54.674
Now where is the center of Rama? You can see there.

19:54.875 --> 19:59.860
The center of Rama is on the right side of the Heart center.

20:00.079 --> 20:02.724
Now if you take the name of Rama and you have no problems,

20:02.924 --> 20:04.830
you will get into problems.

20:05.031 --> 20:07.226
It’s easy to get into the problems

20:07.429 --> 20:11.104
because Shri Rama is a deity.

20:11.304 --> 20:14.601
You cannot just take his name without any protocol.

20:14.801 --> 20:17.163
There is no rhyme and reason. For example,

20:17.363 --> 20:20.765
if I take the name of, say, the Governor of this place

20:20.965 --> 20:24.492
and just go before his house and start shouting his name,

20:24.692 --> 20:25.853
they will arrest me.

20:26.053 --> 20:28.435
In the same way if you take the name of Rama

20:28.635 --> 20:33.630
without having any protocol, without having any understanding,

20:33.830 --> 20:36.075
first of all, this center will be ruined [pointing towards her throat]

20:36.275 --> 20:37.822
because you will be taking the names,

20:38.023 --> 20:41.935
means you will be using your voice all the time unnecessarily

20:42.135 --> 20:45.122
and also the right side Heart Center will be caught.

20:45.322 --> 20:50.541
And all such people will suffer physically from asthma.

20:52.533 --> 20:53.669
Absolutely.

20:53.869 --> 20:55.620
If you have asthma trouble

20:55.820 --> 20:59.895
then you can find out that you are suffering from this Rama center.

21:00.095 --> 21:02.358
Maybe there is something wrong with your father,

21:02.558 --> 21:04.673
or maybe something wrong with your fatherhood,

21:04.873 --> 21:08.037
or maybe that you are missing your father,

21:08.237 --> 21:10.818
or that your father has died,

21:11.018 --> 21:12.881
or something is wrong with that.

21:13.081 --> 21:17.479
Asthma can be cured only by taking Rama’s name.

21:17.714 --> 21:18.745
But if you have asthma

21:18.946 --> 21:22.971
then the name has to be taken by a realized soul.

21:23.199 --> 21:26.376
By a person who is empowered,

21:26.576 --> 21:28.032
who has the protocol,

21:28.232 --> 21:32.634
who can talk to Shri Rama in the sense who is connected.

21:32.834 --> 21:35.255
Any Dick, Tom and Harry cannot take his name.

21:35.455 --> 21:37.021
There is a protocol about it.

21:37.221 --> 21:40.815
In the same way gurus names also

21:41.034 --> 21:44.826
we cannot take without protocol. We must have the protocol.

21:45.026 --> 21:47.942
Anybody who is all the time saying guru, guru, guru, guru

21:48.142 --> 21:51.797
is not paying full attention to it, neither is he respecting.

21:52.017 --> 21:56.473
I have seen people who go against the teachings of a guru.

21:56.673 --> 22:01.444
For example, we can say that all the gurus have taught one thing,

22:01.644 --> 22:04.194
that you have to look after your awareness.

22:04.394 --> 22:08.833
Awareness is in that area, awareness is nourished by liver.

22:09.849 --> 22:12.743
They are very anxious that your liver should be alright.

22:12.943 --> 22:14.040
Whatever they have taught,

22:14.240 --> 22:16.524
they have tried to see that your liver should be all right

22:16.724 --> 22:20.155
and all the gurus have been against alcoholism.

22:20.355 --> 22:22.546
You take Moses, you take Abraham,

22:22.746 --> 22:25.460
you take Nanaka, you take Mohammad Sahab,

22:25.660 --> 22:30.804
all of them are more worried about the liver than for anything else.

22:31.004 --> 22:34.569
Somebody asked me, “Why didn’t Christ decry wine?”

22:34.769 --> 22:36.226
He did not support it either,

22:36.426 --> 22:40.130
but he had some other job to be done, so he didn’t talk about it.

22:40.331 --> 22:41.855
But he never drank wine.

22:42.056 --> 22:45.486
The wine in those days didn’t mean fermented wine as you have.

22:45.705 --> 22:48.232
I mean, people never used to smoke also in those days.

22:48.432 --> 22:52.576
At the time of, say, Mohammad Sahab there was no smoking,

22:52.776 --> 22:54.584
so he never prohibited any smoking.

22:54.784 --> 22:56.240
But he said no narcotics,

22:56.440 --> 22:59.474
nothing that goes against awareness should be taken.

22:59.674 --> 23:02.084
So they said, “Oh, then there is nothing wrong with smoking.”

23:02.284 --> 23:03.463
Then he took his birth,

23:03.664 --> 23:06.228
the same principle took his birth as Guru Nanaka

23:06.429 --> 23:11.593
and Guru Nanaka then said no smoking and no drinking.

23:11.812 --> 23:14.744
Why? Because they were worried about the awareness of a person.

23:14.969 --> 23:16.995
If your awareness is not all right

23:17.195 --> 23:18.611
what’s the use of giving you your realization?

23:18.812 --> 23:22.390
You are already not aware of it.

23:22.828 --> 23:24.323
Now drugs, same thing.

23:24.523 --> 23:26.902
If you take to drugs or anything like that,

23:27.102 --> 23:31.570
you go down in your awareness. It's a fact.

23:31.781 --> 23:36.925
If you take some drugs you may go to the right side

23:37.125 --> 23:40.152
and you might see colors and things. But that’s hallucination.

23:40.352 --> 23:42.242
You go to the other side you may feel,

23:42.443 --> 23:45.437
oh, you are dying and you may go into the subconscious

23:45.656 --> 23:46.980
and then to the collective subconscious.

23:47.180 --> 23:50.235
You may go to the collective supraconscious on the right-hand side.

23:50.447 --> 23:52.603
But to go up you have to keep in the center.

23:52.815 --> 23:56.368
You have to be alert and your awareness should be normal.

23:56.587 --> 23:59.481
To keep it normal, to keep it in balance,

23:59.681 --> 24:01.027
these people prescribe

24:01.228 --> 24:05.134
that you should not try to do anything that is too much.

24:07.892 --> 24:10.173
Extremes should be avoided.

24:10.384 --> 24:13.587
But the result of that was just the opposite.

24:13.790 --> 24:18.360
All the fanatics were born out of these teachings, imagine!

24:18.580 --> 24:21.488
All the fanatics were born out of these teachings,

24:21.688 --> 24:24.898
which were meant not to have any fanaticism.

24:25.250 --> 24:27.969
Actually if somebody is a fanatic,

24:28.170 --> 24:30.576
he develops diseases of the stomach.

24:30.776 --> 24:34.455
Fanaticism gives you horrible diseases of the stomach.

24:34.736 --> 24:37.897
The other day we had a gentleman from Iran.

24:38.097 --> 24:40.686
He is a doctor there and he had cancer.

24:40.886 --> 24:44.222
He came to know about me and he came to see me in London.

24:44.449 --> 24:46.310
And I told him that,

24:46.511 --> 24:49.850
“Do you believe that Mohammad Sahab is the only one

24:50.050 --> 24:51.435
who can save the world?” He said yes.

24:51.636 --> 24:54.042
“Then I think He should have saved it.”

24:54.253 --> 24:57.011
"No but I think He is the only one who can save, He was the last."

24:57.212 --> 25:00.670
I said, “Maybe He might have thought, that 'I am the last',

25:00.870 --> 25:02.877
but He must have been, the way you are behaving,

25:03.077 --> 25:04.759
he must have taken his birth again.”

25:04.959 --> 25:07.313
He could not keep it at that state perhaps.

25:07.513 --> 25:10.685
I said, “Can you believe that he came back as Guru Nanak?”

25:10.919 --> 25:13.204
He said, “I can’t believe it, no I can't believe it.”

25:13.404 --> 25:15.235
I said, “He was the same principle.”

25:15.435 --> 25:17.727
“I can’t believe it.” I said, “Then I can’t help you.

25:17.927 --> 25:21.477
If you are a fanatic, I can’t help you. It cannot be cured.”

25:21.677 --> 25:23.489
Now, he went home and he had terrible time

25:23.690 --> 25:25.512
and his wife was wise enough, she said,

25:25.713 --> 25:28.071
“Now, Islam has not helped you so far,

25:28.271 --> 25:29.502
You have been such a big Muslim,

25:29.702 --> 25:30.975
you have been doing Namaz and all that.

25:31.176 --> 25:32.573
Still your cancer cannot be cured.

25:32.773 --> 25:35.205
So why not listen to Mother. If she says so give up.”

25:35.405 --> 25:38.353
So he came down to me and he said, “All right,

25:38.554 --> 25:40.749
I agree that it was Nanaka

25:40.964 --> 25:42.260
who came on this earth and all that.”

25:42.460 --> 25:44.696
and you will be amazed that he is cured.

25:44.970 --> 25:46.957
He is cured of that trouble.

25:47.262 --> 25:51.691
All these fundamentalist and fanatics, we are aware of it.

25:51.996 --> 25:55.113
Americans had a good look at them recently,

25:55.332 --> 25:59.937
very recently they had a nice shock from a man called Mr. Khomeini.

26:00.137 --> 26:01.214
You know him too well.

26:01.415 --> 26:04.790
But if you go and ask him he’ll say, “Oh, I am just from God.

26:05.032 --> 26:07.635
I am connected with God and it is He

26:07.836 --> 26:10.986
who gave me these orders and it is through His orders I worked out.”

26:11.187 --> 26:13.852
Because they are so blind with the fanaticism

26:14.052 --> 26:15.655
that they don’t want to see.

26:15.855 --> 26:18.932
And this kind of fanaticism, if it crawls into you,

26:19.133 --> 26:20.592
you will also not see.

26:20.792 --> 26:23.819
For example even Christian fundamentalists are the same

26:24.019 --> 26:25.778
or the Hindu fundamentalist are the same.

26:25.978 --> 26:29.329
I don’t find anything different in them.

26:29.540 --> 26:35.206
If you want to ask, say, a Christian about a Jew,

26:35.407 --> 26:37.563
you will know about the Jews, but if you go to the Jews,

26:37.774 --> 26:40.495
they’ll say Christians are the worst of all

26:40.696 --> 26:42.785
and if you go to the Muslims, they will say

26:42.985 --> 26:46.323
the Jews they are the worst, they are the cursed people.

26:46.552 --> 26:49.413
All of them think they are the best, the chosen ones

26:49.614 --> 26:51.563
and the rest of them are going to be doomed.

26:51.763 --> 26:54.583
I must tell you that all fanatics are going to be doomed.

26:54.784 --> 26:59.251
One and all and I think in that domain of hell

26:59.451 --> 27:01.950
they may agree with each other but it may be too late

27:02.151 --> 27:03.193
for them to understand

27:03.443 --> 27:06.872
that God has not created as any fanatics.

27:07.271 --> 27:08.873
He has not.

27:09.099 --> 27:11.142
You are part and parcel of one being.

27:11.342 --> 27:13.794
Supposing this finger says I am all right

27:13.994 --> 27:16.478
or this finger says I am all right,

27:16.678 --> 27:18.435
it is going to trouble the whole body.

27:18.635 --> 27:20.384
It’s such a nonsense that it is better

27:20.585 --> 27:22.427
to cut it out than to keep it there.

27:22.627 --> 27:27.527
Malignancy that works in us is the same that you are your own.

27:27.728 --> 27:30.302
“What’s wrong? I am on my own.”

27:30.502 --> 27:33.196
Any cell that becomes like that is really malignant

27:33.396 --> 27:35.388
because it has no relationship with the whole.

27:35.588 --> 27:38.129
It has no relationship with the coordination

27:38.330 --> 27:41.307
and the cooperation of the whole thing, how it is working out.

27:41.508 --> 27:44.556
It is on its own. “What’s wrong?”

27:44.861 --> 27:50.267
The wrong is that you are getting out of circulation

27:50.587 --> 27:54.717
and very soon you will land up in a place which is called as hell.

27:54.929 --> 27:59.431
And then you will ask,  “Oh, I never knew."

27:59.632 --> 28:01.565
You are all connected with each other.

28:01.765 --> 28:05.184
You are all part and parcel of one collective being

28:05.404 --> 28:09.296
which you have to just feel it and understand that you become that.

28:09.724 --> 28:14.294
Till this [microphone] is connected to the mains this doesn’t work out.

28:14.568 --> 28:16.802
Once it is connected to the mains it works out.

28:17.029 --> 28:20.700
In the same way unless and until you are connected to the mains

28:20.904 --> 28:25.356
you cannot know that you are a collective being.

28:25.661 --> 28:28.759
Before that, we form big organizations,

28:28.959 --> 28:31.419
we are all brothers and sisters and

28:31.620 --> 28:37.125
just after a month of that formation of an organisation you find

28:37.325 --> 28:39.756
that people are cutting each other’s throats.

28:39.956 --> 28:42.752
Why? Because they are not really brothers and sisters.

28:42.953 --> 28:45.291
They have not felt it.

28:45.503 --> 28:49.276
When you become then you just can’t help it.

28:49.636 --> 28:52.856
Like people may say that, Mother, you help so many people,

28:53.057 --> 28:55.083
you do so much for them. Why do you cure them?

28:55.284 --> 28:58.099
I said, “Whom do I cure? Who is the other?

28:58.333 --> 29:01.708
If this finger is paining I have to rub it off and get it all right.

29:01.927 --> 29:03.352
It is part and parcel of me.

29:03.552 --> 29:06.914
If there is not the other then you just help the other person

29:07.114 --> 29:09.031
because he is part and parcel of you.

29:09.231 --> 29:12.935
If somebody is getting drowned and you are trying to save that person,

29:13.170 --> 29:15.806
hzyou are doing it because something in you is right.

29:16.006 --> 29:19.228
You are not doing it because you are trying to help the person.

29:19.428 --> 29:21.140
Because there is something in you is dying

29:21.341 --> 29:22.798
and you want to save that person.

29:22.998 --> 29:25.587
This is what it is and this collectivity

29:25.787 --> 29:30.439
you can only feel if you are first of all in balance.

29:30.736 --> 29:33.384
The people who go off their balances

29:33.627 --> 29:35.638
are very difficult to get their realization.

29:35.838 --> 29:40.373
This is one side of the movement in dharma also when they seek God,

29:40.593 --> 29:45.084
when they seek their realization, they go to the other side of it.

29:45.319 --> 29:49.553
Now people can’t believe that for this you cannot put in any effort.

29:49.882 --> 29:51.697
No action is needed.

29:51.897 --> 29:55.608
Now look at the trees. Look at the flowers.

29:55.936 --> 29:58.857
How spontaneously they become fruits.

29:59.186 --> 30:04.627
Look at the trees, how they turn the leaves towards the sun,

30:04.827 --> 30:08.514
and how they get their chlorophyll established in them,

30:08.733 --> 30:12.502
how it happens so spontaneously, how it works out,

30:12.702 --> 30:13.665
how they understand.

30:13.865 --> 30:17.018
While we think that by doing some sort of an effort

30:17.218 --> 30:20.255
we are going to become something higher,

30:20.498 --> 30:23.301
is an absolutely absurd idea.

30:23.501 --> 30:26.184
As it is you did nothing to become human beings.

30:26.387 --> 30:27.871
You did nothing whatsoever.

30:28.072 --> 30:31.324
You became a human being effortlessly

30:31.567 --> 30:35.348
and if you have to go further it has to be effortless.

30:35.653 --> 30:38.417
Everything vital is always effortless.

30:38.617 --> 30:41.394
As I said the other day, If you have to breathe

30:41.648 --> 30:44.283
and for breathing if you have to go to libraries and

30:44.484 --> 30:46.352
go to some guru and pay him some money,

30:46.553 --> 30:48.913
how many will survive?

30:49.139 --> 30:51.882
It is so vital that it has to happen.

30:52.100 --> 30:54.303
The only difference in this evolution

30:54.504 --> 30:57.209
and the evolutions so far we have had is this,

30:57.483 --> 31:01.678
that this you being free,

31:01.958 --> 31:05.459
you are going to feel it in your awareness.

31:05.724 --> 31:08.949
Before this you never felt it in your awareness.

31:09.155 --> 31:13.076
Only at this time you are going to feel it in your awareness,

31:13.311 --> 31:15.915
that you have become the other person,

31:16.131 --> 31:21.654
that a cocoon has become the butterfly,

31:21.998 --> 31:24.977
that an egg has become a bird.

31:25.203 --> 31:29.191
You can feel it within yourself this happening,

31:29.391 --> 31:33.960
you can absolutely

31:34.695 --> 31:38.452
monitor it within yourself and you are aware of it

31:38.653 --> 31:40.340
that this has happened to me.

31:40.575 --> 31:45.262
This is a blessing placed within you since long

31:45.481 --> 31:49.578
and that’s why it is sahaja, means born with you, sahaja.

31:49.778 --> 31:52.707
But today this Sahaja Yoga has become a maha yoga,

31:52.919 --> 31:54.492
it has become a great yoga

31:54.692 --> 31:57.817
because one can work it out en mass.

31:58.017 --> 32:00.187
For many people can get realization.

32:00.387 --> 32:04.634
Just like a blossom time, many, many flowers can become fruits.

32:04.834 --> 32:07.685
In the same way many people can get realization.

32:07.935 --> 32:10.777
At this time when it is such an important time,

32:10.977 --> 32:13.445
this is the time of judgement that has started.

32:13.646 --> 32:16.343
How will you judge yourself?

32:16.544 --> 32:21.403
How will God judge you? Is He going to put you on, say,

32:21.715 --> 32:24.434
some sort of a weight lifting

32:24.685 --> 32:28.554
or to one of the human tricks that we play

32:28.755 --> 32:30.409
to judge a person’s abilities?

32:30.609 --> 32:34.950
No, the Kundalini is going to rise, first of all.

32:35.208 --> 32:36.602
When the Kundalini rises

32:36.802 --> 32:39.937
you start getting that awareness on your fingers,

32:40.138 --> 32:42.872
you start feeling the all pervading power on your fingers

32:43.146 --> 32:47.835
because these are the centers of your subtle being

32:48.036 --> 32:50.086
which get awakened. You start feeling it.

32:50.286 --> 32:53.371
And by that feeling you get that vibratory awareness

32:53.622 --> 32:55.623
by which you get the discrimination

32:55.824 --> 32:57.265
and you know what’s wrong with you

32:57.465 --> 32:59.684
and you know what’s wrong with others.

32:59.918 --> 33:02.258
So you judge yourself, you improve yourself,

33:02.458 --> 33:04.015
you know the method how to improve yourself,

33:04.215 --> 33:06.586
you feel better and better and better

33:06.786 --> 33:09.535
and then once you are all right you judge yourself.

33:09.778 --> 33:11.348
There is no need for God to judge

33:11.549 --> 33:15.015
but God within you, your own Spirit, judges you.

33:15.215 --> 33:19.952
Because when the Kundalini rises She touches the fontanel bone area

33:20.152 --> 33:21.648
where She pierces through you.

33:21.848 --> 33:23.831
You can feel first sometimes the throbbing

33:24.031 --> 33:27.285
and then the cool breeze starts coming in.

33:27.504 --> 33:31.177
There is the Spirit. The seat of the Spirit,

33:31.378 --> 33:33.615
though he resides in the Heart of the human beings,

33:33.816 --> 33:36.889
the seat of the Spirit is on top of your head

33:37.089 --> 33:40.389
and when it touches that you start getting this discrimination

33:40.589 --> 33:42.171
and you start understanding.

33:42.371 --> 33:44.467
Now if I tell you don’t do this,

33:44.717 --> 33:46.959
that’s why these ten commandments are

33:47.178 --> 33:49.998
that don’t do this, don’t do that.

33:50.201 --> 33:51.517
But human beings are such

33:51.717 --> 33:55.740
if you tell them don’t do it, they’ll do it, a hundred times.

33:56.044 --> 33:58.114
There’s something wrong with them, I tell you,

33:58.349 --> 34:00.485
the brain is sometimes upside down, I think.

34:00.685 --> 34:04.944
If you tell them please don’t do it, even if you tell to a child,

34:05.145 --> 34:09.684
don’t put your hand in the candle, still he will burn it.

34:09.934 --> 34:14.445
He is so ego oriented that he must learn by burning his hand.

34:14.645 --> 34:17.723
He must learn everything through experience of his ego.

34:17.957 --> 34:21.308
Till he is nicely bashed he won’t listen.

34:21.519 --> 34:25.218
So the best thing I thought was to give the realization.

34:25.418 --> 34:26.812
Once you have the realization,

34:27.012 --> 34:30.347
once your car has started, you will know where is the problem.

34:30.621 --> 34:32.847
Because if you tell somebody this is the problem

34:33.048 --> 34:34.339
he may hit you back.

34:34.540 --> 34:37.110
It's not easy. If you tell somebody,”You have too much ego,”

34:37.324 --> 34:39.599
he will come and box you completely.

34:39.800 --> 34:42.440
You can be crucified. I mean, this is what has happened to Christ.

34:42.691 --> 34:45.260
It is not easy to deal with human beings. They are so much-

34:45.461 --> 34:48.092
just like a big snake sitting down there.

34:48.292 --> 34:50.292
You tell them something and it just comes on you.

34:50.493 --> 34:52.387
Because if you mesmerize them,

34:52.587 --> 34:54.996
if you pamper their ego, “Oh you are great people,

34:55.196 --> 34:58.367
only pass on your money to me and you will be yogis,

34:58.567 --> 35:01.532
you will be siddhas," so you don’t mind, its all right, very simple.

35:01.828 --> 35:03.573
You give some money to Mataji Nirmala Devi.

35:03.773 --> 35:05.737
“All right. She has all the money. Doesn’t matter.

35:05.937 --> 35:08.210
We have the siddhas, we are the siddhas.”

35:08.484 --> 35:11.986
We are the great yogis, My name is Fallana Anand,

35:12.187 --> 35:16.171
Thikana Anand, Dhonga Anand.” All these names you will wear.

35:16.372 --> 35:18.569
Then clothes you will wear and walk with a great pride,

35:18.788 --> 35:21.047
“Oh, we are the yogis.”

35:21.247 --> 35:23.442
Absolutely stupid.

35:23.661 --> 35:25.944
You are not, you  are not.

35:26.145 --> 35:29.155
But you believe in it, because there is nothing involved,

35:29.356 --> 35:32.493
you don’t have to grow, nothing, very simple.

35:32.708 --> 35:34.094
It is not so.

35:34.294 --> 35:36.766
You are seekers

35:36.966 --> 35:39.578
and you will be seekers till you have found it.

35:39.778 --> 35:42.450
Its better that you find it and accept it.

35:42.650 --> 35:44.532
Because I said don’t do it,

35:44.760 --> 35:49.808
don’t go there, you are doing it. All right.

35:50.009 --> 35:52.940
So the mother's style is different, alright awaken their Kundalini.

35:53.141 --> 35:54.941
First of all, awaken their Kundalini.

35:55.142 --> 35:57.215
We had one doctor, Rustom Veera

35:57.415 --> 36:02.729
and he is a very good doctor who got his realization.

36:02.930 --> 36:05.714
After that I told him that now you won’t drink

36:05.914 --> 36:07.664
and he really forgot about drinking completely,

36:07.865 --> 36:09.146
I never told him before.

36:09.349 --> 36:10.566
“You drink? All right, come along, doesn’t matter."

36:10.766 --> 36:12.644
Whatever you do, come along.

36:12.844 --> 36:14.612
He said, “Mother, I never felt like drinking.”

36:14.812 --> 36:18.659
But once after some time he went to Germany

36:18.859 --> 36:21.565
and he told me that he used to like some sort of a wine

36:21.765 --> 36:24.206
and he said that now let us see what happens.

36:24.406 --> 36:26.737
Because he was very fond of it,

36:26.937 --> 36:28.468
so he went to drink that

36:28.694 --> 36:31.530
and he got a terrible pain in the stomach, he vomited out,

36:31.731 --> 36:36.152
and the whole thing was smelling like a rotten cork

36:36.352 --> 36:38.777
and he said, “As if a cork was coming out of my mouth,

36:38.977 --> 36:42.309
I felt so horrible and after that I said I’ve had it.”

36:42.509 --> 36:44.938
And his health improved and his money improved

36:45.173 --> 36:48.176
because he was not wasting any more money on these nonsensical things.

36:48.376 --> 36:51.134
He had nice musical gadgets in his house

36:51.334 --> 36:53.838
and he started improving his life in every way.

36:54.038 --> 36:56.610
He started looking so beautiful and so nice.

36:56.810 --> 36:59.484
Now the thing is if I tell you don’t drink,

36:59.684 --> 37:02.052
I tell you, all the pub people will come and hit me hard.

37:02.294 --> 37:04.616
But I don’t say that. It just works out

37:04.820 --> 37:07.702
because once you have found out the nectar,

37:07.955 --> 37:11.036
the beauty of yourself, you do not do it.

37:11.236 --> 37:12.880
You drink because you are bored,

37:13.080 --> 37:15.494
you smoke because you are bored of yourself.

37:15.705 --> 37:18.398
You just get bored. If you are imprisoned,

37:18.598 --> 37:21.083
why should you be so unhappy? You are just facing yourself.

37:21.283 --> 37:24.415
It’s the best thing that can happen to the person is to be imprisoned.

37:24.642 --> 37:26.060
See you are just watching yourself

37:26.260 --> 37:28.099
and Self is the most beautiful thing.

37:28.299 --> 37:32.112
But people are unhappy because they cannot face themselves.

37:32.312 --> 37:34.932
They want to run away. For five minutes also people won’t

37:35.133 --> 37:37.042
sit down together and talk to each other.

37:37.242 --> 37:39.315
They must call you for a cocktail

37:39.515 --> 37:41.402
or there should be a television going on

37:41.602 --> 37:43.652
or there should be some book two people must be reading.

37:43.852 --> 37:47.331
They cannot talk for five minutes. There’s no rapport.

37:47.573 --> 37:53.006
But after realization you feel so relaxed

37:53.206 --> 37:56.240
and so happy with yourself. You enjoy yourself so much

37:56.440 --> 37:58.604
that you forget about these things. Now we have people here,

37:58.805 --> 38:02.329
some of them have been druggists and chemists completely,

38:02.533 --> 38:04.590
alcoholics and all sorts of things

38:04.790 --> 38:06.968
and just it has worked out so well

38:07.168 --> 38:10.974
that they have now become people who are so beautiful.

38:11.174 --> 38:15.611
They have got this nectar of their Spirit and they are giving it.

38:16.049 --> 38:18.994
The imbalances on the left-hand side,

38:19.197 --> 38:21.158
because yesterday I told you about

38:21.359 --> 38:23.948
the physical side and the emotional side,

38:24.149 --> 38:27.720
but today I am telling you about the religious side, what we do.

38:28.079 --> 38:31.630
That we believe in going to spirits,

38:31.830 --> 38:34.529
all the spirits, to the planchettes and this and that.

38:34.729 --> 38:38.802
I was told that in Los Angeles you have got witchcraft,

38:39.002 --> 38:42.400
you have all types of nonsensical things going on.

38:42.814 --> 38:44.470
And for what do you do it?

38:44.670 --> 38:46.689
They said that you see my father died

38:46.889 --> 38:49.577
and I loved him very much and wanted to meet him.

38:49.777 --> 38:54.679
Now “Let him die. Poor thing has died now, is spared of you.

38:54.879 --> 38:57.992
Let him have his freedom. Why are you torturing his soul?”

38:58.192 --> 39:03.511
“Oh, I wanted to talk to him,” and then what you get is asthma.

39:04.013 --> 39:07.840
As a result of that your father suffers because he must die now,

39:08.044 --> 39:10.914
he has to be in another world and you have to face it

39:11.114 --> 39:13.445
because now you are living. You are in the present.

39:13.645 --> 39:17.211
Why do you want to call people who have now gone and finished?

39:17.411 --> 39:20.617
But once you start doing all these things then mesmerism starts,

39:20.817 --> 39:22.800
the ESP starts, all this nonsense starts

39:23.000 --> 39:24.714
and you become slaves to this

39:24.914 --> 39:26.699
and these things can be so dangerous.

39:26.899 --> 39:28.878
English language is such a funny language

39:29.078 --> 39:30.757
that you have got for spirit

39:30.958 --> 39:33.566
even if you have to say the alcohol is spirit

39:33.766 --> 39:35.946
even the spirit that is dead is a spirit

39:36.146 --> 39:38.461
and your Spirit that is in your Heart

39:38.661 --> 39:43.596
which is the Atma is also Spirit and the Holy Ghost is also a Spirit.

39:43.927 --> 39:47.143
So I don’t know which spirit you are worshipping.

39:47.343 --> 39:50.071
I am talking of the Spirit that is the Atma,

39:50.272 --> 39:52.007
the Spirit within your Heart.

39:52.272 --> 39:55.400
And we go to all kinds of these spirits morning till evening,

39:55.600 --> 39:57.416
going towards the left side.

39:57.616 --> 40:01.297
Now you will be amazed the result of this physically is –

40:01.497 --> 40:05.309
physically, leave alone other things –

40:05.838 --> 40:09.270
multiple sclerosis is one of them.

40:09.489 --> 40:12.396
Recently I cured a patient of multiple sclerosis.

40:12.600 --> 40:14.709
He has been to one of these gurus

40:14.910 --> 40:17.876
who is very popular in this country.

40:18.076 --> 40:20.443
He has got multiple sclerosis now.

40:20.701 --> 40:25.600
Another thing that you get is blood cancer.

40:25.952 --> 40:28.694
Most of the cancers come from that side

40:28.960 --> 40:30.924
and all these things can happen to you

40:31.124 --> 40:33.338
if you indulge into the left side.

40:33.558 --> 40:36.025
Now it has been proved by doctors also

40:36.225 --> 40:38.850
that there are some sort of proteins which attack us

40:39.053 --> 40:41.072
from the area which is unknown,

40:41.272 --> 40:45.119
which is built within us since our creation, means our left side,

40:45.319 --> 40:47.301
the collective conscious side.

40:47.501 --> 40:48.520
It has been accepted

40:48.720 --> 40:51.402
but, of course, they call it unknown because they are not seers,

40:51.603 --> 40:53.800
they are not people who have reached that stage to see

40:54.000 --> 40:56.255
that these spirits are coming from the left side.

40:56.455 --> 40:59.966
I actually see them do it and attacking them

41:00.166 --> 41:03.481
and getting out of them and they are there within us.

41:03.681 --> 41:04.931
Any time they can erupt

41:05.132 --> 41:08.423
and trigger anything like cancer on the physical level.

41:08.624 --> 41:10.174
Then you can develop epilepsy,

41:10.374 --> 41:12.077
you can develop schizophrenia,

41:12.278 --> 41:15.312
you can develop all kinds of these mental problems, lunacy.

41:15.512 --> 41:18.473
All these problems comes to you from the left side.

41:18.676 --> 41:22.622
From the right side movement you can become extremely arrogant.

41:22.826 --> 41:27.235
You can become absolutely useless for any talking or discussion.

41:27.435 --> 41:32.023
You lack all the sense of proportion and you can become even Hitler.

41:32.224 --> 41:36.411
Hitler is one of the symbols of this development of right side.

41:36.615 --> 41:40.207
Those who push you into your egos

41:40.408 --> 41:42.511
and pamper you too much, be very careful about them.

41:42.712 --> 41:46.033
Be very careful, because they are pushing you into the right,

41:46.236 --> 41:50.804
in your dharma also, in your ascent, in your seeking,

41:51.004 --> 41:53.570
and the ones which are giving you on the left-hand side

41:53.770 --> 41:55.672
are also doing the same.

41:55.872 --> 41:58.664
Now the simple thing is that people who are money-minded themselves

41:58.864 --> 42:02.637
they have a problem. Always money-minded people

42:03.019 --> 42:08.788
are stuck up – I don’t know what to call them –

42:08.988 --> 42:10.796
they are absolutely stuck up people

42:10.996 --> 42:13.218
because money-mindedness comes to us

42:13.418 --> 42:16.019
because we value money more than anything else.

42:16.269 --> 42:19.409
Money is not the source of joy by any chance.

42:19.613 --> 42:21.891
Even those who have lots of money, if you go and see them,

42:22.091 --> 42:25.016
they are the most miserable people.

42:25.216 --> 42:28.664
On the contrary, a man who hasn’t got so much money,

42:28.864 --> 42:30.912
who has no problems, he is happy.

42:31.112 --> 42:34.490
For example, supposing I own this machine.

42:34.690 --> 42:37.315
Let's take a simple example -

42:37.619 --> 42:39.821
What happens to me – I am worried about it,

42:40.021 --> 42:43.106
about cleansing it, about its insurance, I don’t know what is

42:43.307 --> 42:45.511
the income tax, all these things come with it.

42:45.711 --> 42:48.698
If I don’t own it, it is owned by, say, Mr.Hugo,

42:48.898 --> 42:50.228
the headache is gone.

42:50.429 --> 42:52.965
To possess something means a headache.

42:53.293 --> 42:57.107
Today I wanted to have some money cashed.

42:57.326 --> 43:00.571
It was such an experience of such a developed country like yours

43:00.771 --> 43:02.705
and Los Angeles I was amazed.

43:03.017 --> 43:06.761
We couldn’t get money anywhere.

43:06.962 --> 43:12.227
We only needed two thousand dollars.

43:12.428 --> 43:16.930
I had to pay cash money to people

43:17.131 --> 43:18.906
and they said we don’t have so much money.

43:19.107 --> 43:20.923
They told us to go to the main bank

43:21.123 --> 43:23.766
and it was as if we went to the mint.

43:23.978 --> 43:27.693
From 9:30 till about one o’clock we couldn’t get the money.

43:27.893 --> 43:30.874
They made me sign this, sign that, sign this.

43:31.074 --> 43:32.407
I said, “What’s happening?

43:32.607 --> 43:35.665
You people are supposed to be affluent people. There is no trust,

43:35.865 --> 43:37.796
are people standing with a pistol somewhere?

43:37.997 --> 43:39.571
What is happening - I don’t understand.

43:39.771 --> 43:42.005
When you have so much money. How could you have so much?”

43:42.232 --> 43:45.367
But in India no problem.

43:45.568 --> 43:47.848
I was in a place called Nilambar.

43:48.048 --> 43:52.281
I told Warren, “I am not going. You take my passport

43:52.482 --> 43:55.758
and give them this thing that I have signed.”

43:55.958 --> 43:58.266
Not only that, they sent money, they heard I was here,

43:58.466 --> 44:01.013
they all came from the bank to take my darshan

44:01.224 --> 44:03.540
and to get their realization.

44:03.740 --> 44:06.790
People trust in poor countries, they just trust.

44:06.990 --> 44:09.144
Here you come, you have to have visa and this thing.

44:09.344 --> 44:11.824
In India if you come nobody will be bothered.

44:12.024 --> 44:15.627
You have to trust. If riches means mistrust... ?

44:15.827 --> 44:18.086
In London people won’t open their houses.

44:18.352 --> 44:21.789
Even a rat does not enter their house.

44:21.989 --> 44:26.429
Morning till evening, the wives, poor things, are cleaning.

44:26.630 --> 44:30.431
I’ve seen them cleaning all the knobs, everything,

44:30.631 --> 44:33.603
cleaning the garden, all these things.

44:33.803 --> 44:36.556
I not even a rat enters their house.

44:36.756 --> 44:38.984
They open the door only a very small gap.

44:39.185 --> 44:41.853
I have not seen anybody enter their house.

44:42.053 --> 44:43.692
Only the husband and wife come,

44:43.892 --> 44:46.120
all frightened, looking at each other,

44:46.321 --> 44:47.598
holding their purses like this.

44:47.798 --> 44:49.160
It’s most surprising.

44:49.360 --> 44:53.096
You are people belonging to a free country.

44:53.297 --> 44:55.199
From where did you get these people around?

44:55.399 --> 44:57.753
In India there’s no question.

44:57.954 --> 45:01.332
We walk with all our ornaments. Nobody does that to us.

45:01.532 --> 45:06.769
One lady was killed when she was wearing lots of ornaments.

45:06.969 --> 45:08.727
Early in the morning, she was going by a train

45:08.928 --> 45:11.070
all alone in first class, going for a wedding

45:11.287 --> 45:13.308
and some man killed her and took all the ornaments.

45:13.508 --> 45:15.339
It was too much of a temptation.

45:15.540 --> 45:17.948
And the place was that and the time was that.

45:18.148 --> 45:20.673
Oh, God, there was the whole of the university

45:20.874 --> 45:23.429
went into strike for that.

45:23.647 --> 45:25.303
Such a commotion had risen.

45:25.503 --> 45:29.232
I said in London every third day there is a mugging going on.

45:29.433 --> 45:31.603
This is nothing. In London it’s so common

45:31.803 --> 45:36.083
and now I am told that here you can’t get money even in the bank.

45:36.357 --> 45:38.013
I have to go for three hours

45:38.214 --> 45:40.810
just to get an ordinary two thousand dollars.

45:41.010 --> 45:45.274
Can you believe it? And is that the sign of freedom?

45:45.510 --> 45:47.927
Is that the sign of affluence?

45:48.127 --> 45:51.904
What is happening is that people are insecure,

45:52.104 --> 45:54.449
they are insecure completely

45:54.650 --> 45:57.711
because of this money mounting. They live with their money.

45:57.912 --> 46:00.630
If there is no money what is the matter?

46:00.975 --> 46:04.562
It doesn't matter. It is not so important.

46:04.763 --> 46:08.586
But the way people are after money all the time counting every pie,

46:08.786 --> 46:10.264
they lose this chance.

46:10.464 --> 46:15.550
Their Vishuddhis go out but worst of all their Nabhi,

46:15.816 --> 46:18.452
the Nabhi Chakra goes out. You get a Left Nabhi problem.

46:18.652 --> 46:20.718
Such people may get also blood cancers

46:20.918 --> 46:22.913
they may get troubles of the left Nabhi,

46:23.120 --> 46:27.061
and such people have such a terrific

46:27.261 --> 46:32.825
speediness and such franticness.

46:33.036 --> 46:36.563
If they see money somewhere they go absolutely mad

46:36.763 --> 46:40.867
as if money is like a some sort of a spirit or ghost they have seen.

46:41.067 --> 46:44.864
Any talk of money they just jump onto it. It’s too much.

46:45.064 --> 46:46.903
I just can’t understand such personalities.

46:47.103 --> 46:49.504
They are most abnormal, absurd people.

46:49.704 --> 46:52.184
How are they human beings if money can rule you?

46:52.384 --> 46:55.278
Then you are slaves of money.

46:55.630 --> 46:58.320
You talk of independence and freedom. Where is your freedom?

46:58.520 --> 47:01.153
The money is ruling you here.

47:01.411 --> 47:03.050
That’s what happens in your seeking.

47:03.250 --> 47:06.726
When you come to a money-minded person,

47:06.943 --> 47:10.742
he will say, “You can pay money to me

47:10.951 --> 47:13.329
and you can purchase God.” You feel very happy.

47:13.529 --> 47:16.981
“Ah, very good idea. We can purchase God also.”

47:17.380 --> 47:20.536
Can you purchase God?

47:20.833 --> 47:23.453
That’s how these people take advantage of that ego.

47:23.653 --> 47:29.273
You think that we have money and we can purchase God.

47:29.599 --> 47:35.567
Christ has said that a rich man cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.

47:36.107 --> 47:41.847
Even a camel can pass through the

47:42.465 --> 47:44.816
hole of a needle,

47:45.019 --> 47:49.506
but a rich man cannot enter into the Kingdom of God

47:49.706 --> 47:52.035
because he is stuck up.

47:59.128 --> 48:04.327
He is completely entranced with this money thing.

48:04.527 --> 48:08.624
Now when they start that this is all junk and this is all nonsense,

48:08.824 --> 48:10.682
we should get out of it.

48:10.933 --> 48:12.020
So what do you do?

48:12.220 --> 48:17.489
You say give up these things, let us start another counter culture.

48:17.689 --> 48:19.426
But you are not out of it.

48:19.630 --> 48:22.137
Just it is a make believe. You are not out of it.

48:22.341 --> 48:25.125
You think that you have done it but you have not done it.

48:25.325 --> 48:28.840
How you will get out of it is only through your awakening

48:29.041 --> 48:31.351
of this center where there is a deity

48:31.551 --> 48:34.085
who is the Father,

48:34.285 --> 48:37.995
who is the preserver aspect of God,

48:38.195 --> 48:40.065
who exists in that area.

48:40.265 --> 48:43.799
Unless and until you believe that there is a preserver

48:43.999 --> 48:47.803
who looks after us, the God Almighty looks after us,

48:48.003 --> 48:49.873
you are not going to get out of it.

48:50.074 --> 48:52.561
After realization, supposing you are a poor person,

48:52.761 --> 48:54.132
If you have problems of money

48:54.332 --> 48:56.972
you will be surprised, your material side improves.

48:57.173 --> 49:00.538
It improves so much.

49:00.738 --> 49:04.526
But how? Krishna has said, “Yoga kshema vahamyaham.”

49:04.737 --> 49:07.464
When you get the yoga you get the well being.

49:07.675 --> 49:12.473
When you get the union with God, then this is the center of Lakshmi,

49:12.674 --> 49:15.118
the center of the Goddess of wealth, of well being –

49:15.318 --> 49:17.909
if She is awakened in you, you get your money.

49:18.109 --> 49:21.671
But the money is not the way Mr. Ford has got, no, not that money.

49:21.875 --> 49:22.956
It is the Lakshmi.

49:23.156 --> 49:27.237
Lakshmi is a very beautiful symbol of a balanced, moneyed man.

49:27.437 --> 49:30.987
In Her one hand, first of all, She is a lady.

49:31.187 --> 49:33.237
She is a lady standing on a lotus.

49:33.438 --> 49:37.398
Can you imagine how light She must be.

49:37.625 --> 49:41.257
Here if a rich man walks you see he must have a special honking thing.

49:41.492 --> 49:44.579
If he sits here he must show that he is a very rich man.

49:44.779 --> 49:46.758
He walks with a big gait

49:46.959 --> 49:50.220
and he must have a big car to show off that he is a very big man.

49:50.420 --> 49:53.091
But here She just stands on a lotus.

49:53.292 --> 49:57.143
She is so simple

49:58.631 --> 50:00.214
and She has four hands.

50:00.415 --> 50:02.825
On two hands She has got the lotus.

50:03.025 --> 50:07.110
Lotus means She has warmth, She has Love, the pink color,

50:07.345 --> 50:11.673
and inside the lotus is such a soft

50:13.031 --> 50:15.355
bed, a soft bed,

50:15.555 --> 50:19.742
and the bed is used by a very

50:21.203 --> 50:25.857
thorny insect whom we call as a beetle.

50:26.083 --> 50:31.778
It’s a very thorny black thing that is used for sleeping.

50:32.107 --> 50:36.876
So the person who has money has to be warm like a lotus

50:37.076 --> 50:40.345
and anybody who comes to his house he must be welcomed

50:40.545 --> 50:42.126
the way the lotus welcomes

50:42.326 --> 50:46.849
and puts him on this beautiful soft couch.

50:47.169 --> 50:50.583
Even a person like a gnat, if he comes, She must offer.

50:50.783 --> 50:54.974
This as a sign. Here if a guest comes in, had it.

50:55.174 --> 50:58.550
And the guest, as soon as he sees the face of a person

50:58.751 --> 51:00.039
where he enters, he just runs away.

51:00.240 --> 51:03.704
He can’t bear it because to them it means expense.

51:03.904 --> 51:05.993
Any guest coming in, means expense.

51:06.193 --> 51:10.335
But the amount of joy one can get in giving something to another

51:10.536 --> 51:11.749
is not there.

51:11.950 --> 51:16.702
So generosity is the only way to overcome your greed for money.

51:16.902 --> 51:20.604
If you earn money better give it. If you earn two, give three.

51:20.855 --> 51:23.115
If you buy something, buy it for giving.

51:23.315 --> 51:27.940
If you start doing like that you will get over this money-mindedness

51:28.172 --> 51:32.971
which is such a mire into which so many people have embedded.

51:33.331 --> 51:34.865
Actually the poor are better,

51:35.065 --> 51:38.149
If you go to a poor man’s house he will offer you a lot of milk,

51:38.349 --> 51:39.914
he will be happy that you have come to his house.

51:40.114 --> 51:41.711
Whatever things he has he will offer you.

51:41.911 --> 51:44.938
But if you go to a rich man’s house he will be really frightened

51:45.138 --> 51:46.902
that one guest has come in his house

51:47.102 --> 51:49.558
when he can afford to look after thousands.

51:49.758 --> 51:53.455
He cannot bear it. So generosity is the only solution for people

51:53.656 --> 51:54.753
who are money-minded.

51:54.953 --> 51:57.574
On the contrary your generosity will flow to people

51:57.774 --> 52:01.586
who do not deserve it like these horrible gurus.

52:01.789 --> 52:04.989
You see that they have got keeps, they have got big cars,

52:05.193 --> 52:08.622
they have built big mansions. They are parasites

52:08.849 --> 52:12.196
and you are flowing money on to them because your ego is there.

52:12.396 --> 52:17.075
We have cults in India where they have competitions.

52:17.286 --> 52:20.372
They take out the god’s photograph outside.

52:20.591 --> 52:24.441
The one who is going to give 500 pounds,

52:24.641 --> 52:27.681
say for example, sits on the horse.

52:27.881 --> 52:32.013
The one who gives 1000 pounds will sit on the elephant.

52:32.225 --> 52:33.978
Like that they go on with the god

52:34.178 --> 52:37.510
and that’s how they go on in that community.

52:37.710 --> 52:39.268
I have seen they also auction it.

52:39.468 --> 52:44.546
“Now the one on the horse, how much, how much, how much, 500 pounds.”

52:44.827 --> 52:49.595
It’s like that, they are selling God and it’s a very regular thing.

52:49.795 --> 52:52.423
You have to go and we call it calling,

52:52.623 --> 52:55.068
calling for that, how much money you are going to pay.

52:55.279 --> 52:58.087
Is this the way to receive God and to understand him?

52:58.287 --> 52:59.985
This is all right for money-minded people.

53:00.185 --> 53:03.090
They will go into the mire of money and finish there.

53:03.302 --> 53:05.258
God is Love.

53:05.458 --> 53:09.936
He is not money. He doesn’t understand money

53:10.137 --> 53:12.610
and godly people don’t. I am absolutely hopeless,

53:12.810 --> 53:13.999
I don’t understand this,

53:14.199 --> 53:16.690
I don’t know how to sign a check, I don’t know anything.

53:16.890 --> 53:19.675
I only know Kundalini, but if you ask me about the money part

53:19.875 --> 53:22.378
I am so hopelessly bad that you will be amazed.

53:22.578 --> 53:25.362
I am just like a rustic person

53:25.562 --> 53:28.956
who has never known ABCs of anything as far as money is concerned

53:29.156 --> 53:31.714
because I don’t understand why to worry about it so much.

53:31.914 --> 53:36.202
What is the great need to count every time, to measure every time,

53:36.429 --> 53:39.229
to find out every time? There’s no need.

53:39.747 --> 53:43.242
All that - such a headache, such a worry, such a problem.

53:43.442 --> 53:46.242
Use whatever you get, you just live with it.

53:46.442 --> 53:48.453
Why to worry about all these small things

53:48.653 --> 53:52.547
and to go about wasting your life for this nonsensical thing

53:52.747 --> 53:55.381
like material things. These we can create.

53:55.582 --> 53:58.758
Just if you hit it in them it will all be created.

53:58.958 --> 54:01.008
Human beings have already created.

54:01.208 --> 54:03.374
What is so great about them?

54:03.632 --> 54:05.964
Now you have to take to the living course,

54:06.164 --> 54:10.304
the living power within you by which you create living work.

54:10.562 --> 54:12.823
After realization you will be amazed.

54:13.023 --> 54:16.681
If you give vibrations to the wheat or to any such things,

54:16.882 --> 54:18.917
to flowers, you get such big flowers.

54:19.117 --> 54:24.073
We have tried this in an agricultural university

54:24.273 --> 54:27.753
and they have found out when you give vibrations to the wheat

54:27.953 --> 54:32.366
it can increase five times more in its growth.

54:32.585 --> 54:34.448
They have seen an Indian cow,

54:34.648 --> 54:36.976
if she is given vibrated water to drink,

54:37.177 --> 54:38.727
she can give quite a lot of milk.

54:38.927 --> 54:42.383
Not so much as we can say an Australian cow,

54:42.583 --> 54:46.817
but Australian cows milk is not a good thing.

54:47.059 --> 54:48.360
Too much on the right hand side.

54:48.560 --> 54:52.627
But she will give so much more than what she normally gives.

54:52.856 --> 54:55.992
So you do not become too much. You become a Lakshmipati

54:56.192 --> 54:58.929
which means you get so much money that you can receive people,

54:59.129 --> 55:01.547
you can invite them, you are cosy

55:01.747 --> 55:04.422
and you live in a house which is beautiful.

55:04.622 --> 55:08.875
She has another hand which is just giving.

55:09.196 --> 55:12.582
If you earn you must give. Otherwise the whole thing stagnates.

55:12.782 --> 55:17.182
I have known people who have gathered newspapers since 50 years.

55:17.626 --> 55:21.832
They've got tubes of toothpaste gathered since they have been born.

55:22.032 --> 55:23.934
All sorts of things we gather here

55:24.134 --> 55:27.012
thinking that - you see all kinds of mad people

55:27.212 --> 55:29.534
who go on collecting things

55:29.734 --> 55:32.453
and you have to actually get the municipal people

55:32.657 --> 55:35.409
to take it away after paying them big money

55:35.610 --> 55:37.730
to clear out this nonsense of the garbage

55:37.930 --> 55:40.308
these people have created in the house.

55:40.508 --> 55:44.010
So this is how you should allow things to flow from your house.

55:44.211 --> 55:46.863
Let it go, give it, give it and give it.

55:47.063 --> 55:49.222
When you give then new things come in.

55:49.422 --> 55:52.671
I have been giving only in my lifetime.

55:52.890 --> 55:55.491
You will be amazed, I go on giving and giving and giving,

55:55.749 --> 55:58.217
but still my house and my everything is so filled

55:58.418 --> 56:03.819
I don’t know what to do. Every time I get a chance I give

56:04.030 --> 56:06.666
so that I do not hurt anybody and I give them.

56:06.866 --> 56:08.907
But I find the whole house is filling up.

56:09.107 --> 56:11.617
You give somebody one flower, they’ll send 10 flowers.

56:11.817 --> 56:15.598
What to do? I can’t understand the people who preserve

56:15.872 --> 56:19.946
they’ll decay and become so old sitting down counting everything

56:20.146 --> 56:24.552
while I have seen this is the most healthy way of living in this world.

56:24.764 --> 56:27.029
Just give, just give. Do not worry.

56:27.240 --> 56:30.732
Anybody ask anything, likes to order? Have it.

56:31.154 --> 56:34.009
It’s such a beautiful thing, such a great thing, such a joy.

56:34.209 --> 56:37.251
Suddenly you meet somebody. The other day I met a lady in a party.

56:37.451 --> 56:39.361
She said, “Do you remember? You gave me this?”

56:39.561 --> 56:42.813
I said, “Which one?” She said, “This one. I am wearing a pearl.

56:43.013 --> 56:44.695
I had come to your house when I was married.

56:44.895 --> 56:47.196
You gave me this pearl.” I said, “Really? I don’t remember.”

56:47.396 --> 56:49.747
“Oh, I wore it today just to show you.”

56:49.951 --> 56:51.517
I felt so happy.

56:51.717 --> 56:54.263
Just what a little thing like pearl necklace I had given her.

56:54.466 --> 56:58.727
But what a thing to remember all her life. She met me after 20 years.

56:58.927 --> 57:02.219
That time she was pregnant and today she had a son.

57:02.461 --> 57:05.168
I was so amazed to see this beautiful thing happening.

57:05.368 --> 57:09.644
She wore it all the time, and she wore it the day she was to meet me.

57:09.844 --> 57:13.292
She knew I was coming to the party. What a great feeling.

57:13.492 --> 57:16.844
You cannot purchase it with thousands of these pearl necklaces

57:17.044 --> 57:22.488
can be thrown on this little beautiful event in my life

57:22.688 --> 57:26.545
that I felt this lady how she had cared for a little thing like that.

57:26.745 --> 57:31.723
All these things are for expressing your love

57:31.924 --> 57:34.966
and if you understand the value of love, you can get rid of it.

57:35.166 --> 57:38.801
Now the other hand of the Goddess is like this [Shri Mataji shows her right hand palm].

57:39.106 --> 57:43.225
This means a person who has money must give ashraya.

57:43.426 --> 57:48.417
Ashraya means he must give a protection to people.

57:48.902 --> 57:52.874
He must have some people who are in their protection.

57:53.074 --> 57:57.182
Like in India people say that you have a servant system,

57:57.383 --> 58:02.031
but of course I do not say that in India servants are treated,

58:02.274 --> 58:07.930
I mean, my servant has a better bedroom than I have

58:08.234 --> 58:11.230
because my husband has one bedroom and actually I have a small one

58:11.430 --> 58:14.068
because I share his bedroom and he has a bigger one

58:14.279 --> 58:16.142
and he lives better than me in many ways

58:16.342 --> 58:18.956
but he is a person who can do all this work.

58:19.156 --> 58:20.589
Now I have to do Kundalini work.

58:20.789 --> 58:22.667
If I start sweeping and swabbing in the house,

58:22.867 --> 58:24.249
if my husband has to sweep and swab,

58:24.450 --> 58:26.448
whose going to look after his office?

58:26.648 --> 58:29.566
Here the thing is, even the president must go on and sweep and swab

58:29.766 --> 58:32.799
otherwise he is not all right. I don’t understand.

58:32.999 --> 58:35.792
If you have people who are dependent upon you,

58:35.992 --> 58:37.761
I mean, your children should work for you.

58:37.961 --> 58:39.324
In the same way there are servants.

58:39.524 --> 58:41.535
If they work for you, what is wrong?

58:41.735 --> 58:44.402
In England I have seen old people die.

58:44.602 --> 58:46.024
There is nobody to look after them.

58:46.224 --> 58:47.995
One month they are lying in the rooms,

58:48.195 --> 58:49.822
there’s nobody to pick their bodies

58:50.022 --> 58:52.064
because they cannot have somebody to help.

58:52.264 --> 58:56.189
And the young people are sitting outside and taking ganjas.

58:56.389 --> 58:58.623
A shameful thing it is.

58:59.147 --> 59:01.236
All their children might be taking ganja somewhere

59:01.436 --> 59:03.205
and their father is dying here.

59:03.405 --> 59:05.175
Why can’t these people go and work

59:05.375 --> 59:08.143
and help their parents and look after them.

59:08.343 --> 59:10.697
If they are old they are suppose to clean, sweep and swab.

59:10.897 --> 59:13.213
Even the eighty year old people must drive their cars,

59:13.413 --> 59:15.643
they must take them to the thing. It’s not good.

59:15.843 --> 59:17.486
You are not just to them.

59:17.686 --> 59:19.940
So you must have people in ashraya if you have money.

59:20.141 --> 59:22.722
You should have people to do some work for you.

59:22.922 --> 59:26.535
But everybody wants to do every work by themselves.

59:26.735 --> 59:30.511
For example now, the stitching of a blouse.

59:30.711 --> 59:34.144
We have a tailor. We have had him for about 20-30 years.

59:34.344 --> 59:37.965
Since my daughters were married he is tailoring my blouses.

59:38.165 --> 59:39.731
Now he is a poor man. How much does he take?

59:39.931 --> 59:42.790
At the most, say, about 2 dollars or 1 dollar for this thing.

59:42.991 --> 59:45.358
Let him have it. He can only do that much work?

59:45.559 --> 59:47.598
Let him do that work. He is an expert in it now.

59:47.799 --> 59:49.047
I have no time to do my sewing

59:49.247 --> 59:51.281
so you will say, “Why should you waste your time on that?

59:51.481 --> 59:52.882
Why should you waste your money on that?”

59:53.082 --> 59:56.424
But I can’t stitch the way he does it. Let him do it. What’s wrong?

59:56.625 --> 59:58.323
Here we have killed all our art,

59:58.523 --> 01:00:04.152
all our aesthetics by doing everything yourself.

01:00:04.352 --> 01:00:06.097
You cannot do everything yourself.

01:00:06.297 --> 01:00:10.531
Now paper, if you have to apply paper you must do yourself.

01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:13.628
Why don’t you share your money with somebody else?

01:00:13.828 --> 01:00:16.503
Why do you want to do everything yourself?

01:00:16.703 --> 01:00:18.400
The same thing has happened to our cooking.

01:00:18.601 --> 01:00:20.917
People eat nothing but fodder here sometimes

01:00:21.117 --> 01:00:23.397
the way they cut everything, just eat all that.

01:00:23.624 --> 01:00:26.827
It’s a good excuse to say that we are eating all the vitamins

01:00:27.038 --> 01:00:30.224
but that’s too hard for human digestion. It’s not good.

01:00:30.424 --> 01:00:33.232
You never cook in the house because the wife must work,

01:00:33.432 --> 01:00:35.981
the husband must work, they all must go to the office,

01:00:36.181 --> 01:00:37.696
they all should work, the wife has no time,

01:00:37.896 --> 01:00:40.325
the husband has no time, no time for the children.

01:00:40.525 --> 01:00:42.583
The wife has to cook in the house.

01:00:42.783 --> 01:00:45.200
If she has spare time, all right, she should work also,

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:46.570
she has to look after the children.

01:00:46.770 --> 01:00:49.466
There is nothing wrong in that work, that’s a very noble work.

01:00:49.666 --> 01:00:51.591
The idea I sometimes say

01:00:51.791 --> 01:00:55.310
those people who have done good work in their previous lives

01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:58.567
are the mothers today. They are having a nice time.

01:00:58.767 --> 01:01:02.118
I look at my husband, I say how much he works hard.

01:01:02.330 --> 01:01:04.989
Now as a mother, I do work for my Sahaja Yoga

01:01:05.189 --> 01:01:07.224
but otherwise I have a comfortable life.

01:01:07.424 --> 01:01:09.544
So why must you all do all the work?

01:01:09.744 --> 01:01:11.677
You must have some people for your ashraya,

01:01:11.877 --> 01:01:13.251
you must give them some money,

01:01:13.452 --> 01:01:15.864
share your money with others, protect them.

01:01:16.064 --> 01:01:19.705
This is one of the things that we have to understand about this deity

01:01:19.905 --> 01:01:23.104
which is called as a Lakshmi and She resides in our stomach.

01:01:23.304 --> 01:01:25.534
This is very important to understand

01:01:25.734 --> 01:01:30.239
that if you want to have the blessings of the Divine

01:01:30.439 --> 01:01:32.419
you should be a balanced person.

01:01:32.619 --> 01:01:36.566
You have to awaken the Lakshmi principle within you

01:01:36.767 --> 01:01:40.137
and that Lakshmi resides in this kind of balancing

01:01:40.337 --> 01:01:44.280
where you understand that Love is the determining factor

01:01:44.484 --> 01:01:50.359
of all our monetary behavior, monetary exchanges and rapport.

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:53.058
There is no other way we can judge it

01:01:53.258 --> 01:01:55.933
and that’s the main basic thing

01:01:56.133 --> 01:01:58.845
which we are missing today in the modern times.

01:01:59.046 --> 01:02:04.602
Now the Kundalini’s awakening takes place and awakens this center.

01:02:04.845 --> 01:02:10.395
When this is awakened then you go higher into the center

01:02:10.595 --> 01:02:15.129
which is higher we can say called as the center of the Heart.

01:02:15.388 --> 01:02:20.594
But between these two is a center that is moving round and round,

01:02:20.794 --> 01:02:25.257
is a center of our activity which is the center of Swadhisthana.

01:02:25.457 --> 01:02:27.093
I have told you about this yesterday

01:02:27.293 --> 01:02:31.132
that how by activating the Swadhisthana Chakra too much

01:02:31.332 --> 01:02:33.687
we develop imbalances with in us.

01:02:33.887 --> 01:02:36.310
We develop diseases like diabetes,

01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:42.244
diseases like kidney and spleen

01:02:42.534 --> 01:02:47.013
and also uterus trouble in women because there are imbalances.

01:02:47.213 --> 01:02:50.326
After this center,

01:02:50.526 --> 01:02:54.316
which is the center of our activity,

01:02:54.517 --> 01:02:57.486
when we have gone beyond this center

01:02:57.686 --> 01:03:03.022
then we go to this center which is called as the Center of Heart.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:06.080
This is a very important center in human beings,

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:09.431
is governed by the deity of Jagadamba,

01:03:09.631 --> 01:03:12.509
meaning the Mother of the universe.

01:03:12.709 --> 01:03:18.243
This center is acting

01:03:18.443 --> 01:03:20.638
on our sternum in our childhood.

01:03:20.889 --> 01:03:24.951
We develop our antibodies in our sternum

01:03:25.171 --> 01:03:27.486
when this center starts acting

01:03:27.686 --> 01:03:32.025
and these antibodies later on spread in the whole body

01:03:32.225 --> 01:03:37.588
and start defending us against all kinds of diseases,

01:03:37.788 --> 01:03:41.455
against all kinds of attacks on us

01:03:41.655 --> 01:03:45.957
and these doctors know about it, they know there are antibodies,

01:03:46.157 --> 01:03:49.847
but they cannot say how they are created and how they are within us.

01:03:50.047 --> 01:03:52.686
When we are attacked from outside by anything,

01:03:52.886 --> 01:03:55.139
what happens is that you start getting a palpitation

01:03:55.339 --> 01:03:58.873
because these people are informed through the sternum bone

01:03:59.073 --> 01:04:02.475
that the attack is coming and this palpitation suggest

01:04:02.675 --> 01:04:08.579
that there is an emergency and antibodies must fight it.

01:04:09.009 --> 01:04:12.724
Now the women who are insecure like that

01:04:12.924 --> 01:04:17.875
develop breast cancer

01:04:18.975 --> 01:04:21.947
and these diseases can be very dangerous

01:04:22.147 --> 01:04:26.337
in people who have insecurities

01:04:26.538 --> 01:04:30.158
and who hide themselves and who do not tell about insecurities.

01:04:30.358 --> 01:04:31.811
They can develop these diseases

01:04:32.012 --> 01:04:35.225
and ultimately they can be in terrible trouble.

01:04:35.483 --> 01:04:38.377
Today I am sorry I won’t be able to cover all the centers

01:04:38.577 --> 01:04:42.846
because its already quite late and we have this hall only till 10:30.

01:04:43.046 --> 01:04:47.917
So we have to do the actualization of the experience

01:04:48.117 --> 01:04:51.143
of getting the realization and we have to work it out.

01:04:51.343 --> 01:04:54.865
So that is the main thing and whatever was possible I have told you

01:04:55.065 --> 01:04:59.081
the theory behind the awakening of the Kundalini up to these centers

01:04:59.281 --> 01:05:03.724
and if possible tomorrow I will try to do the other two centers.

01:05:03.924 --> 01:05:09.142
Now should we have the experience?

01:05:17.888 --> 01:05:20.579
I think it would be better if everyone moves forward,

01:05:20.779 --> 01:05:24.302
will be better for us to work it out.

01:06:13.263 --> 01:06:16.155
You just put your both the hands towards me.

01:06:16.373 --> 01:06:18.336
Better thing would be to take out your shoes

01:06:18.537 --> 01:06:21.750
because the Mother Earth has to take the problem inside it,

01:06:22.008 --> 01:06:23.675
it would be a good idea.

01:06:33.298 --> 01:06:36.845
Now I have to request you

01:06:37.048 --> 01:06:40.930
that you might get your realization today

01:06:41.197 --> 01:06:46.829
but the Kundalini is just made out of many threads

01:06:47.806 --> 01:06:51.669
and one of the threads comes up

01:06:51.869 --> 01:06:56.929
to open your Sahastrara in this point [Shri Mataji pointing towards fontanel bone
area]

01:06:57.485 --> 01:07:00.547
and then this is raise starts working out now

01:07:00.867 --> 01:07:04.289
but that’s not the end of it.

01:07:04.610 --> 01:07:08.833
You have to make more space for greater threads to go in

01:07:09.036 --> 01:07:12.598
to establish yourself in Sahaja Yoga.

01:07:12.818 --> 01:07:17.247
Now to do that you have to come

01:07:18.511 --> 01:07:23.745
to a center where this collective happening can take place.

01:07:24.035 --> 01:07:27.100
Of course tomorrow we are going to have this program here

01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:30.186
but after that I am going away

01:07:30.436 --> 01:07:34.670
and he has agreed to stay here

01:07:37.038 --> 01:07:40.686
and it is going to work it out from [UNCLEAR].

01:07:40.889 --> 01:07:45.420
They want to establish some sort of a center here in Los Angeles

01:07:45.663 --> 01:07:49.451
where you people can go every week say in a weekend or something

01:07:49.651 --> 01:07:54.690
and develop your powers, your own powers,

01:07:54.901 --> 01:07:57.912
and master it

01:07:58.112 --> 01:08:00.943
so that you start giving realization to others.

01:08:01.143 --> 01:08:03.221
You all can do it.

01:08:03.597 --> 01:08:08.266
In the beginning what happens is that,

01:08:08.486 --> 01:08:13.682
like anything, any light which you enlightened is rather difficult.

01:08:13.883 --> 01:08:15.254
You have to look after it.

01:08:15.454 --> 01:08:17.989
Any seed that has sprouted, the seedling

01:08:18.189 --> 01:08:21.575
is a sensitive, gentle thing you have to look after.

01:08:21.775 --> 01:08:25.565
But then once it grows, it becomes like a tree

01:08:25.766 --> 01:08:28.082
and you can give realization to many.

01:08:28.282 --> 01:08:31.573
Now we have been here, as he himself has been with me

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:34.673
only for 18 months,

01:08:34.892 --> 01:08:37.329
and imagine how many people he has given realization to,

01:08:37.530 --> 01:08:40.551
you can’t count it, in Australia.

01:08:40.751 --> 01:08:44.956
Each person who is here, who is in your [UNCLEAR]

01:08:45.207 --> 01:08:49.409
there is no need to get any sanction or anything. You can start off.

01:08:49.644 --> 01:08:52.729
It’s very simple as long as you are settled down.

01:08:52.957 --> 01:08:56.011
You can start out in your own house, isn’t it?

01:08:56.212 --> 01:09:00.993
Anywhere, you can advertise - and start a Sahaja Yoga center.

01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:06.858
So one has to first of all grow and settle into it.

01:09:07.058 --> 01:09:10.534
So it’s not that today you are going to get it. In the last moment (?)

01:09:10.753 --> 01:09:12.743
you may lose it tomorrow for the time being

01:09:12.943 --> 01:09:17.814
but once it is established, you will never lose it. It is always there.
