00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:08.419
Today is a great day of Navaratri,

00:00:10.062 --> 00:00:16.937
we are sitting on the cusp of the sixth and the seventh.

00:00:18.716 --> 00:00:25.605
Sixth and the seventh is the day when Mahasaraswati

00:00:26.665 --> 00:00:28.693
finished Her work

00:00:28.773 --> 00:00:34.242
and the incarnation of the Shakti itself started.

00:00:34.322 --> 00:00:40.876
So, at twelve o’clock today the
Devi takes the Shakti upon Herself.

00:00:40.956 --> 00:00:48.424
Of course, as you know that Mahakali and Mahasaraswati,

00:00:48.504 --> 00:01:00.504
both are the powers of Shri Sadashiva.

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:09.785
Adi Shakti first formed Herself into Mahakali,

00:01:09.865 --> 00:01:14.919
which is the Power of Desire.

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:18.982
But all these powers are nothing

00:01:19.062 --> 00:01:26.999
but the power of God’s love.

00:01:28.817 --> 00:01:36.280
So, in the series of this great love of God,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.918
Adi Shakti had to first become the Power of Desire.

00:01:41.998 --> 00:01:43.758
In the same way,

00:01:43.838 --> 00:01:48.471
Sahaja Yogis who are bestowed with this power of love

00:01:48.551 --> 00:01:53.551
have to have full desire in their heart.

00:01:55.607 --> 00:02:00.551
Desire to love.

00:02:02.087 --> 00:02:07.552
That desire is very different from

00:02:07.632 --> 00:02:12.988
the other kinds of human love we have known.

00:02:13.068 --> 00:02:21.524
In other kinds of human love,
when we have relations with others,

00:02:21.604 --> 00:02:24.945
we have expectations,

00:02:25.025 --> 00:02:29.471
and that’s why it is very disappointing.

00:02:29.551 --> 00:02:33.471
Our expectations always run higher

00:02:33.551 --> 00:02:39.248
than our understanding and realities.

00:02:39.328 --> 00:02:44.036
And so we suffer from disappointments and frustrations.

00:02:44.116 --> 00:02:50.672
And the love that has to be nourishing and fulfilling

00:02:50.752 --> 00:02:54.752
becomes a thankless job.

00:02:56.884 --> 00:02:59.655
So, when it reflects in the human beings,

00:02:59.735 --> 00:03:05.170
it is the desire to be loved by everyone,

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.710
not to love others.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.116
Everyone should love you, but
how far you love another is the point.

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:19.124
Naturally everyone for oneself!

00:03:19.204 --> 00:03:23.507
So really nobody loves.

00:03:23.587 --> 00:03:26.829
But when it comes to real love

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:32.406
then sacrifice, becomes a nature.

00:03:32.486 --> 00:03:37.548
You don’t call it a sacrifice, but you call it a privilege.

00:03:37.628 --> 00:03:41.885
We say it’s a privilege to give love.

00:03:41.965 --> 00:03:46.971
It’s a great chance that we can love.

00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:51.373
It’s our great fortune that we can love.

00:03:51.453 --> 00:03:57.235
It’s God’s blessings that we can love and give.

00:03:57.315 --> 00:04:02.343
So, the giving starts when you realise,

00:04:02.423 --> 00:04:06.496
not understand but realise the love,

00:04:06.576 --> 00:04:10.237
the power of love expressing .

00:04:10.317 --> 00:04:14.318
That’s the third power, which starts expressing .

00:04:14.398 --> 00:04:19.921
Because, after this, a person becomes active, kriyasheet.

00:04:20.001 --> 00:04:24.971
That’s how the action of

00:04:25.051 --> 00:04:29.080
achieving that state of giving love starts.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.881
To begin with we start activating in so many ways.

00:04:33.961 --> 00:04:39.971
As I said, we start expecting

00:04:40.051 --> 00:04:47.514
and thinking that we are loving others.

00:04:47.594 --> 00:04:50.971
We act for that.

00:04:51.051 --> 00:04:54.535
In that madness that others should love us,

00:04:54.615 --> 00:04:56.616
others should respect us,

00:04:56.696 --> 00:04:58.697
others should think we are great,

00:04:58.777 --> 00:05:00.890
they should recognise us

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.036
we start loving something else which is not so important.

00:05:06.116 --> 00:05:10.661
So, we go on first to money,

00:05:10.741 --> 00:05:14.515
money becomes a very important point.

00:05:14.595 --> 00:05:19.484
We think that, if we have money, people will love us.

00:05:19.564 --> 00:05:26.201
We become very powerful as moneyed people, as rich people.

00:05:26.281 --> 00:05:28.971
So, we start accumulating money,

00:05:29.051 --> 00:05:36.074
we start loving the money.

00:05:36.154 --> 00:05:40.889
But money is not the Truth; we don’t love the Truth.

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:43.395
When we start loving the money

00:05:43.475 --> 00:05:46.971
we start thinking about problems of money.

00:05:47.051 --> 00:05:54.081
Such people can become miserly to such an extent

00:05:54.161 --> 00:05:56.811
that even towards God they become miserly.

00:05:56.891 --> 00:05:58.708
They never have money actually,

00:05:58.788 --> 00:06:02.560
because if you cannot spend your money, you have no money.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.712
If it is not available what’s the
use of having all the money?

00:06:07.792 --> 00:06:10.962
That’s how they have problems

00:06:11.042 --> 00:06:17.246
because they love money and not the God Almighty.

00:06:17.326 --> 00:06:22.971
They’re worried about money but not about the Truth.

00:06:23.051 --> 00:06:28.109
Then with that they go to a second thing: is the power.

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:32.838
They want to have the power; they want to become presidents,

00:06:32.918 --> 00:06:38.644
ministers and bureaucrats and all that.

00:06:38.724 --> 00:06:42.808
They want to have the power:
they think by having great power

00:06:42.888 --> 00:06:45.755
people will respect them and love them.

00:06:45.835 --> 00:06:51.161
But they get drowned in fear.

00:06:51.241 --> 00:06:55.488
What they get is fear. All the time they have fear.

00:06:55.568 --> 00:06:57.815
Also moneyed people have fear.

00:06:57.895 --> 00:07:03.800
That’s why in the Bible it is
said that: wages of sin is fear.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:09.069
What is sin? Sin is not to love the Truth.

00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:13.649
Is the sin. When you don’t love the Truth then it is sin.

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:20.588
So, when you start getting worried about your positions…

00:07:20.668 --> 00:07:25.304
Like the president feels that he’ll lose his job,

00:07:25.384 --> 00:07:32.449
the vice president thinks that he’ll be sacked,

00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:37.971
the prime minister thinks he may not be elected,

00:07:38.052 --> 00:07:40.858
the bureaucrats think they will lose their jobs,

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:43.052
they won’t get promotions or something,

00:07:43.132 --> 00:07:44.971
there will be problem.

00:07:45.051 --> 00:07:48.632
All these people are suffering from terrible sense of fear.

00:07:48.712 --> 00:07:51.451
They have no freedom of any kind.

00:07:51.531 --> 00:07:56.424
And in that category people just go down so much with fear,

00:07:56.504 --> 00:08:00.110
that even worse than people with money.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:03.191
Because once they are lost, they are lost.

00:08:03.271 --> 00:08:06.931
They can never revive. No chance.

00:08:07.011 --> 00:08:10.971
Once you lose the elections you
are lost, nobody is going to look at you.

00:08:11.051 --> 00:08:14.477
I have known people who have been at a very high position

00:08:14.557 --> 00:08:19.161
and once they lose that position nobody looks at them,

00:08:19.241 --> 00:08:20.971
they just walk like straight,

00:08:21.051 --> 00:08:25.052
otherwise there will be at least
hundred cars to receive them.

00:08:25.132 --> 00:08:29.052
And once they lose their jobs
there’s nobody even to look at them.

00:08:29.132 --> 00:08:31.632
They just walk like ordinary people.

00:08:31.712 --> 00:08:33.958
Even seeing all these things happening,

00:08:34.038 --> 00:08:41.111
this truth just coming before them so clearly,

00:08:41.191 --> 00:08:44.773
they do not keep to that truth,

00:08:44.853 --> 00:08:47.503
they do not realise that truth,

00:08:47.583 --> 00:08:53.240
they do not have that realisation within them.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:59.459
They understand for a while, and they go after that.

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:01.578
Then when the person dies,

00:09:01.658 --> 00:09:07.204
they see a moneyed man, a rich man is forgotten,

00:09:07.284 --> 00:09:11.285
nobody is bothered about them, who was a rich man.

00:09:11.365 --> 00:09:13.100
On the contrary, the people,

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:17.504
the prime ministers and all those
high-ranking people, when they die,

00:09:17.584 --> 00:09:22.065
immediately books start coming out about their private life:

00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:25.441
all the dirty things they did

00:09:25.521 --> 00:09:30.070
and all the horrible things they
did and what sort of life they led

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.151
There’s no fragrance in their life,

00:09:32.231 --> 00:09:36.231
no idealism. Nothing.

00:09:37.357 --> 00:09:39.910
Because the responsibility

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.803
that they have to the public

00:09:42.883 --> 00:09:46.784
and to themselves they have not understood it

00:09:46.864 --> 00:09:49.392
and they made a mess of their private life.

00:09:49.472 --> 00:09:56.423
That’s why this kind of a reaction comes after it.

00:09:56.503 --> 00:10:02.663
The other day I was reading an
interview with a very well-known actor.

00:10:02.743 --> 00:10:07.094
He’s a born realised fellow, I
know, but he’s gone down completely.

00:10:07.174 --> 00:10:09.801
He says, “I think, what’s the harm in drinking,

00:10:09.881 --> 00:10:11.652
what’s the harm in gambling,?

00:10:11.732 --> 00:10:14.599
what’s the harm in smoking?

00:10:14.679 --> 00:10:17.971
Because, after all, I’m going to die

00:10:18.051 --> 00:10:22.316
and then who is going to bother?

00:10:22.396 --> 00:10:26.285
Supposing, I get cancer, so
what? In any case I’m going to die.

00:10:26.365 --> 00:10:30.150
So why not enjoy these pleasures of life?”

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:35.882
But what about death? You continue with it.

00:10:35.962 --> 00:10:40.126
Then all that you’ve been doing will come out,

00:10:40.206 --> 00:10:45.073
and people will not to like to have
your photograph in the household.

00:10:45.153 --> 00:10:48.671
Children will spit at you. What about that?

00:10:48.751 --> 00:10:53.219
Your life is not what it is today
for three, four years or ten years

00:10:53.299 --> 00:10:56.300
or fifteen years of your so-called success.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:03.098
But when you die all this craziness will disappear,

00:11:03.178 --> 00:11:06.788
and people will come out with truth about you.

00:11:06.868 --> 00:11:12.751
That is how this power to be popular finishes off.

00:11:14.017 --> 00:11:16.300
This cheap popularity,

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:24.380
this cheap type of treatment towards yourself

00:11:26.067 --> 00:11:31.045
gives you a personality that will not be worshipped,

00:11:31.125 --> 00:11:33.671
that will not be accepted.

00:11:33.751 --> 00:11:36.274
Nobody will quote you as something great.

00:11:36.354 --> 00:11:38.355
For some time, it will continue,

00:11:38.435 --> 00:11:45.933
but in totality such a person has given nothing to humanity.

00:11:47.366 --> 00:11:50.669
That’s how the power of Saraswati works.

00:11:50.749 --> 00:11:54.247
People go into action

00:11:54.327 --> 00:12:02.820
for achieving the results of getting into power.

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:08.751
But it should act to discover the truth.

00:12:10.856 --> 00:12:17.901
Saraswati should give you the leap to find out the truth.

00:12:17.981 --> 00:12:24.874
That, when you act in those funny places and streets,

00:12:24.954 --> 00:12:29.055
you discover this is not the path, we have missed it.

00:12:29.135 --> 00:12:32.761
The path is somewhere else. We’ve lost it.

00:12:32.841 --> 00:12:36.357
Let us find out the real path because this doesn’t give joy.

00:12:36.437 --> 00:12:38.524
This one can learn from others,

00:12:38.604 --> 00:12:43.626
from history, from so many other
things and from your own parents,

00:12:43.706 --> 00:12:48.954
from your society and from
yourself and from your children also.

00:12:49.034 --> 00:12:51.846
If you want to learn,

00:12:51.926 --> 00:12:55.408
that is the quality of Saraswati pujaris,

00:12:55.488 --> 00:13:00.253
that they take to gyana, they take to reality.

00:13:00.333 --> 00:13:03.464
Vedas, in the beginning of the Vedas,

00:13:03.544 --> 00:13:08.059
it’s said that: if by reading these four Vedas,

00:13:09.487 --> 00:13:13.260
if you do not get the veeda,

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:19.111
veeda is the knowledge on your nerves, means Realisation,

00:13:19.191 --> 00:13:28.508
there is no use reading these Vedas.

00:13:28.588 --> 00:13:35.217
So, the Saraswati’s first thing is that through the reading,

00:13:35.297 --> 00:13:40.545
through the process of Saraswati’s manifestation,

00:13:40.625 --> 00:13:44.733
you must reach a point to
understand that this is a rat-race,

00:13:44.813 --> 00:13:46.467
and we have to get out of it.

00:13:46.547 --> 00:13:48.326
We have to step out.

00:13:48.406 --> 00:13:50.513
When that happens,

00:13:50.593 --> 00:13:53.478
then the Mahalakshmi Tattwa starts working in you,

00:13:53.558 --> 00:13:58.558
that is the third tattwa, which starts working.

00:14:03.526 --> 00:14:11.103
Mahalakshmi Tattwa then starts
expressing its love in its full extent

00:14:11.183 --> 00:14:15.408
through evolutionary process in human beings.

00:14:15.488 --> 00:14:19.691
He starts evolving simultaneously.

00:14:19.771 --> 00:14:23.545
He sees on both the sides what’s happening,

00:14:23.625 --> 00:14:31.563
like a witness and he uses his Mahalakshmi power.

00:14:31.643 --> 00:14:35.961
In the first part of the Mahalakshmi power

00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:43.486
he starts getting out of the
common rut of the family bondages

00:14:43.566 --> 00:14:51.283
and the other human bondages of power,

00:14:51.363 --> 00:14:55.083
money, lust

00:14:55.163 --> 00:14:59.913
and he starts moving on a higher plane.

00:15:00.966 --> 00:15:08.019
He gives us a new idea of popularity

00:15:08.099 --> 00:15:13.348
by establishing the Truth.

00:15:13.428 --> 00:15:15.630
Because through Mahalakshmi power

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:21.256
you discover the Truth on your central nervous system

00:15:21.336 --> 00:15:32.336
and ultimately it is the light of an enlightened brain.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:41.448
When the Mahalakshmi power starts manifesting,

00:15:41.528 --> 00:15:45.630
one starts thinking of others.

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:48.287
Not on material level,

00:15:48.367 --> 00:15:50.630
that materially people are suffering,

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:55.807
“Now there are people in Ethiopia, who will
save? We must give them some food, this, that.

00:15:55.887 --> 00:16:01.509
” No! They go to the roots of the problems. Why?

00:16:01.589 --> 00:16:07.119
Or they don’t think there should be
equal distribution of money and wealth.

00:16:07.199 --> 00:16:09.262
No. This is superficial.

00:16:09.342 --> 00:16:16.342
Because wherever it is done people are not happy.

00:16:18.065 --> 00:16:21.970
They feel they have no freedom.

00:16:23.629 --> 00:16:27.266
Those people who have money are not happy

00:16:27.346 --> 00:16:31.371
because they have a demonic life.

00:16:31.451 --> 00:16:35.212
Where they are free they behave like devils.

00:16:35.292 --> 00:16:41.813
No sense of totality, no sense of collectivity.

00:16:41.893 --> 00:16:45.548
When they become like that,

00:16:47.819 --> 00:16:54.363
they even do not realise that they have become demonic.

00:16:54.443 --> 00:17:00.443
Everything becomes like a big martyrdom.

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:09.123
They fight for lands, they fight
for nations, they fight for rights.

00:17:09.203 --> 00:17:11.968
And they do all kinds of horrible things.

00:17:12.048 --> 00:17:19.309
Start destroying people, human beings.

00:17:19.389 --> 00:17:24.949
All the turmoil of today is the effect of

00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:28.324
mostly in the West,

00:17:28.404 --> 00:17:31.513
and also all the Arabic countries,

00:17:31.593 --> 00:17:36.746
I would say – is of the right side.

00:17:36.826 --> 00:17:42.827
And in the East, it is of the left side - the turmoils.

00:17:42.907 --> 00:17:47.293
It’s very surprising that

00:17:47.373 --> 00:17:51.469
it’s very contrasting also. It’s a funny dilemma for Me,

00:17:51.549 --> 00:17:53.899
I can’t understand it sometimes

00:17:53.979 --> 00:17:59.292
that where they are so particular about the chastity,

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:10.389
they become when they are so much
worried about chastity and everything,

00:18:10.469 --> 00:18:13.682
that they should have problem of the left side.

00:18:13.762 --> 00:18:16.502
They do puja, they have shraddha, they are

00:18:16.582 --> 00:18:19.915
like Catholics, we can say, are never rich people,

00:18:19.995 --> 00:18:23.890
seldom, except in Switzerland,

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.770
I think, here everybody’s rich

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:32.997
because they are so money-oriented.

00:18:33.077 --> 00:18:38.936
So, or the people where they are right sided,

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:45.450
when they neglect their chastity,

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:49.437
not bothered about the right side,

00:18:49.517 --> 00:18:54.313
they have the problems of the right side,

00:18:55.383 --> 00:18:57.817
is very surprising.

00:18:57.897 --> 00:19:04.796
The reason is where they look after the chastity part

00:19:04.876 --> 00:19:07.876
they go too much into it.

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:15.710
Now, supposing a person is doing a puja.

00:19:17.743 --> 00:19:22.203
He just goes on doing puja, puja, puja morning till evening,

00:19:22.283 --> 00:19:25.855
without any activity. Very easy to do puja, isn’t it?

00:19:25.935 --> 00:19:29.630
Just come down, somebody
does puja for you, get the vibrations,

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:31.230
nicely blessed, go home.

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:33.630
Nothing to be done,

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:35.710
no activity.

00:19:37.256 --> 00:19:39.968
So, there is no balance.

00:19:40.048 --> 00:19:44.269
So, they do puja and they think,
“Oh, they have done very well.”

00:19:44.349 --> 00:19:48.630
No, if you are a right sided person,

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:53.203
then puja will help you, but
not if you are a left sided person.

00:19:57.523 --> 00:20:01.630
Puja does help, of course, My Puja will help, no doubt,

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:07.237
in both the sides, because I’m
neither left nor right nor anywhere.

00:20:17.783 --> 00:20:22.448
So the puja part when they do …

00:20:22.528 --> 00:20:28.191
supposing a man is doing a puja to a Devi.

00:20:28.271 --> 00:20:33.869
In India they take a great courage to do puja to a Devi,

00:20:33.949 --> 00:20:37.204
you do not know that. Saptashati. That’s where we have

00:20:37.284 --> 00:20:41.146
that thing that the way people do, they get possessed,

00:20:41.226 --> 00:20:43.286
they can’t understand.

00:20:43.366 --> 00:20:47.630
First of all, they have a statue of
someone made by some horrible fellow.

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:50.711
When they will do the puja of that Goddess,

00:20:50.791 --> 00:20:54.630
they are God-fearing, everything is good,

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:57.996
we have got temples where there are also,

00:20:58.076 --> 00:21:01.076
we can say, swayambhus

00:21:03.096 --> 00:21:07.178
from the Mother Earth, which are worshipped

00:21:07.258 --> 00:21:11.894
and should be all right, but no! They get possessed. Why?

00:21:11.974 --> 00:21:14.630
Because most of them,

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:20.574
these temples are hounded by or haunted by spirits.

00:21:20.654 --> 00:21:23.799
Because they do all kinds of tantaric things there.

00:21:23.879 --> 00:21:28.855
And when people go and do the
pujas there what happens to them?

00:21:28.935 --> 00:21:32.438
That they get attacked,

00:21:34.343 --> 00:21:37.969
they become more left sided.

00:21:38.049 --> 00:21:42.050
Now the Muslims and others who believe in a God

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:46.843
which is neerakara, which is formless,

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:54.630
they go to the right side. There’s formless
God, it’s nice, formless everywhere is God,

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:59.921
in Me, in you, everyone there is God, everybody’s God.

00:22:00.001 --> 00:22:03.387
Even if you are a devil, you are God.

00:22:03.467 --> 00:22:07.540
There’s nothing wrong with anyone, everybody’s God!

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:11.179
Starts on that principle.

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:15.371
So, they go onto supra-conscious side

00:22:15.451 --> 00:22:19.073
and they become demonic.

00:22:20.749 --> 00:22:24.630
Then they must fight, because
they are devils. Devils have to fight;

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:28.277
otherwise, how will they exist?

00:22:29.629 --> 00:22:34.711
They fight, they aggress, they go to other countries,

00:22:34.791 --> 00:22:40.356
aggress them, capture them, all the
time they are thinking of aggressing others.

00:22:40.436 --> 00:22:46.797
In a subtler way they aggress, nowadays
the media is aggressive in the West.

00:22:46.877 --> 00:22:51.375
There are so many ways of aggression and to them aggression

00:22:51.455 --> 00:22:55.630
is something is very dharmic.

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:57.481
For anything.

00:22:57.561 --> 00:22:59.906
They’ll ask direct questions,

00:22:59.986 --> 00:23:05.986
arrogant, insulting and cruel,

00:23:07.856 --> 00:23:10.305
they become cruel.

00:23:13.177 --> 00:23:15.475
That’s how the turmoil starts

00:23:15.555 --> 00:23:18.630
when we start using the power of Saraswati

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:22.312
in a wrong way or the power of Mahakali.

00:23:26.863 --> 00:23:30.864
That’s why in Sahaja Yoga before the Puja

00:23:30.944 --> 00:23:33.132
we have to go into lot of activity.

00:23:33.212 --> 00:23:38.630
You have to decorate the hall, you have to get the flowers,

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:41.883
you have to organize everything beautifully.

00:23:41.963 --> 00:23:45.259
Look at the roses, how beautiful they are.

00:23:45.339 --> 00:23:52.226
Then you starts balancing yourself
with all these activities you do.

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:59.711
And then you sit down for puja.

00:23:59.791 --> 00:24:05.357
That’s like in the daytime you work, in the night you sleep.

00:24:05.437 --> 00:24:10.903
To rest, to get the place: you must be active.

00:24:10.983 --> 00:24:16.711
Like they have to climb Himalayas to achieve meditation,

00:24:16.791 --> 00:24:19.630
because when you are tired,

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:23.099
you can be restful afterwards.

00:24:23.179 --> 00:24:27.711
Otherwise, if you get somebody, say, from Switzerland only,

00:24:27.791 --> 00:24:33.001
the very speedy person for meditation,

00:24:33.081 --> 00:24:37.630
you’ll have to put the glue on him

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:41.742
to settle down because he’ll
be frantic, you know, all the time.

00:24:41.822 --> 00:24:45.709
Will be all the time jumping!

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:56.710
So, the activity has to come before the puja

00:24:58.103 --> 00:25:00.630
and the balance has to be established.

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:05.376
So, the ladies have to find out the
saris and the blouses and this and that

00:25:05.456 --> 00:25:08.356
and they have to worry about putting the flowers,

00:25:08.436 --> 00:25:12.323
arranging things, this, that. Lot of activities!

00:25:12.403 --> 00:25:17.250
We have to travel. For English it was
necessary to travel all the way from England,

00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:21.729
to arrange their money and
rooms and everything to come here,

00:25:21.809 --> 00:25:27.363
to go to futuristic side, to
think what they are going to pay,

00:25:27.443 --> 00:25:32.389
how they are going to pay back their loans!

00:25:34.084 --> 00:25:42.630
All this futuristic: planning they have
to do before they come to Switzerland.

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:51.843
Switzerland being the most active place, it’s better
to have the puja here, so they are not so much active!

00:25:51.923 --> 00:25:57.343
That’s how the Devi arranges everything.

00:25:57.423 --> 00:26:01.423
So the ascent starts evolving.

00:26:03.203 --> 00:26:10.873
In that, the play of the Devi is the
Navaratri – in your ascent – from ages.

00:26:10.953 --> 00:26:16.630
Navaratri: that’s why is the most important Puja.

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:21.269
In Sahaja Yoga, Navaratri is the most important puja.

00:26:21.349 --> 00:26:25.003
Though we can say in modern Sahaja Yoga Sahastrar Day is,

00:26:25.083 --> 00:26:28.175
because that’s how you started getting your Realisation.

00:26:28.256 --> 00:26:34.630
But if you go to the whole historical events of evolution

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:42.822
you’ll find [that] Navaratri is the one
which has brought you to Sahastrara.

00:26:42.902 --> 00:26:47.915
Without the help of the Devi at
different stages of your ascent,

00:26:47.995 --> 00:26:52.859
you could not have been in a
position to receive your Realisation.

00:26:52.939 --> 00:27:00.557
So all the steps that you took
in the past are today worshipped

00:27:00.637 --> 00:27:07.848
and are used for thanking the Devi
for what She did to bring you down here.

00:27:07.928 --> 00:27:10.630
So, it’s like a thanksgiving.

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:14.960
Without Her work nothing could have happened.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.843
So, when we read about the Devi, about Her incarnations:

00:27:18.923 --> 00:27:23.296
how She came on this Earth to save Her bhaktas,

00:27:23.376 --> 00:27:32.579
people who were trying to ascend, to cross this bhavasagara,

00:27:33.927 --> 00:27:36.630
how She worked hard,

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:39.413
how she fought the devils,

00:27:39.493 --> 00:27:45.989
how She fought, She killed the demons single-handed,

00:27:46.069 --> 00:27:52.810
She took upon Herself the responsibility of
making the people cross the bhavasagara.

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:58.001
Guru gave you the strength to have dharma,
but She is the one who brought you out.

00:27:58.081 --> 00:28:03.093
Even those who were dharmic could
not do it because of the demonic pressure.

00:28:03.173 --> 00:28:10.795
She’s the One who fought single-handed
with Her powers of destruction.

00:28:10.875 --> 00:28:15.779
In Her love for you She fought.
She brought you to this level.

00:28:15.859 --> 00:28:21.517
And then She took a milder form of incarnation.

00:28:21.597 --> 00:28:25.036
Even during the time of all the gurus,

00:28:25.116 --> 00:28:35.537
She took the form of, as you know,
Janaki was the daughter of Janaka,

00:28:35.617 --> 00:28:41.549
then Fatima was the daughter of Mohammed Sahib

00:28:41.629 --> 00:28:44.857
and Nanaki was the sister of Nanaka.

00:28:44.937 --> 00:28:57.028
In those forms, these Powers
sustained and nourished the Guru Tattwa.

00:28:57.108 --> 00:29:04.108
And later on, or sometimes simultaneously,

00:29:07.428 --> 00:29:15.531
They incarnated in milder forms
to help human beings to rise.

00:29:15.611 --> 00:29:19.765
So, today is the day of thanksgiving.

00:29:19.845 --> 00:29:24.343
As Guru Puja is a day of thanksgiving to your Guru,

00:29:24.423 --> 00:29:27.487
the One who has counselled you,

00:29:27.567 --> 00:29:30.251
the One who has told you about the Truth,

00:29:30.331 --> 00:29:38.816
the One who has taught you the
Truth and has given you Realisation.

00:29:38.896 --> 00:29:44.703
And the Devi puja is a thanksgiving where, single-handed,

00:29:44.783 --> 00:29:49.943
just like a very loving mother, under Her sari,

00:29:50.023 --> 00:29:59.400
She protected you, fought for you,
fought with every enemy that is around,

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:05.106
every sort of problems that existed

00:30:05.186 --> 00:30:12.462
and ultimately brought you into Sahastrara
level and then gave you Realisation.

00:30:12.542 --> 00:30:17.097
It’s a real thanksgiving to the Mother.

00:30:17.177 --> 00:30:22.966
So, we can say Navaratri is like a Mother’s
Day where you give thanksgiving to Her:

00:30:23.046 --> 00:30:31.317
which was just relentless,
continuous working for Her children.

00:30:34.353 --> 00:30:39.546
Motherhood is much more important than the guruhood.

00:30:39.626 --> 00:30:45.235
Because guru is the one who trains you, makes you efficient.

00:30:45.315 --> 00:30:48.221
But the Mother forgives you,

00:30:48.301 --> 00:30:52.774
She loves you, She sustains you
and She teaches you how to love.

00:30:52.854 --> 00:30:59.050
She has tremendous patience and
tremendous, love and She does it single-handed.

00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:05.145
She doesn’t expect anything from you – absolutely selfless.

00:31:05.225 --> 00:31:11.828
'Selfless’ is a very small word I should
say, it’s such an expansive compassion

00:31:11.908 --> 00:31:23.129
which engulfs everything that is
wrong, dissolves it, digest it, absorbs it.

00:31:23.209 --> 00:31:28.908
So, it’s a very great day Navaratri
is, for all the Sahaja Yogis,

00:31:28.988 --> 00:31:39.172
because then She took Her form
as Sita, as the Power of Shri Rama,

00:31:39.252 --> 00:31:48.208
silent potential, suffering. How much
She suffered! How much She suffered!

00:31:49.623 --> 00:31:54.295
Then She took the form of Radha.

00:31:54.375 --> 00:32:03.630
Then She came as five powers of
Saraswati as the five wives of Shri Krishna.

00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:11.114
Then She came as Mary: that was the greatest
suffering, I think, to see the Son being crucified.

00:32:11.194 --> 00:32:17.293
The suffering, silent, patient
suffering, She had to go through it.

00:32:17.373 --> 00:32:20.782
All that drama, to be seen, was too much.

00:32:20.862 --> 00:32:26.490
She went through all that because
you all had to cross your Agya Chakra.

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:28.571
She had to sacrifice Her Child.

00:32:28.651 --> 00:32:33.443
It’s easy for a father to do
that, very difficult for a mother.

00:32:33.523 --> 00:32:39.803
Now you are all mothers, so many of
you, you will know what it is to have a child

00:32:39.883 --> 00:32:43.953
and how one feels about it.

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:47.837
After doing that,

00:32:47.917 --> 00:32:53.630
She comes to the state where
you have to give your Realisation.

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:56.930
Is a work of tremendous patience, as you know.

00:32:57.010 --> 00:33:00.630
It’s tremendous patience and understanding.

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:08.469
Human beings, as the time advanced,
have evolved no doubt for Realisation,

00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:14.156
but also evolved to very funny,
stupid, crooked nonsensical ways.

00:33:14.236 --> 00:33:19.976
It’s impossible to understand how
they go about with their stupid ideas

00:33:20.056 --> 00:33:22.463
and how troublesome they can be!

00:33:22.543 --> 00:33:27.630
They can be very crooked, funny, troublesome

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:35.872
to such an extent that sometimes
even it is difficult to forgive.

00:33:35.952 --> 00:33:41.630
Despite that so many of you are here today, in Europe,

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:47.630
in the land of the Guru, here I
find, who have got Realisation.

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:54.711
So, the Mother’s pride, Mother’s joy
knows no bounds,no doubt about it.

00:33:54.791 --> 00:33:58.026
It’s such a great thing to see Her children

00:33:58.106 --> 00:34:04.630
sitting here to receive all the powers from Her.

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:09.580
Now, again, when we are in this situation, we have to know

00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:14.796
the first principle with which the whole thing started:

00:34:14.876 --> 00:34:19.378
that it is the power of love.

00:34:23.994 --> 00:34:27.630
It is the power of love that has brought you to this state

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:35.630
and it’s the power of love that you will
express and manifest; you will evolve.

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:43.647
Now, after coming to Sahaja Yoga also
the temptations become subtler and subtler.

00:34:43.727 --> 00:34:50.130
We try to do Sahaj Yog, we try to spread
Sahaja Yoga, sometimes for the powers .

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:53.730
Maybe you are lonely, so you want to have more Sahaja Yogis.

00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:59.950
Maybe you do it because you think
that that’s how you spread your powers.

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:03.963
Even there are problems on
leadership I find, ego problems there are.

00:35:04.043 --> 00:35:08.630
Somebody’s appointed a leader then
another feels bad, this, that all goes on.

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:11.869
I see the drama going on. Like small children they fight.

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:19.303
What is this leadership? Is just artificial!
It’s not even noted in any newspaper!

00:35:23.936 --> 00:35:30.325
As they have mock governments, we have a mock leadership.

00:35:30.405 --> 00:35:33.966
So, then people fight for that – this becomes subtler.

00:35:34.046 --> 00:35:38.759
The power struggle goes on becoming subtler and subtler.

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:45.762
Then again money problems come up. Some people think that

00:35:45.842 --> 00:35:48.843
Sahaja Yoga is a very big way of making money.

00:35:48.923 --> 00:35:53.819
Or some people think that, “We can get lot of money, because

00:35:53.899 --> 00:35:58.081
Mother blesses people with money,
affluence, so let us be in Sahaja Yoga,”

00:35:58.161 --> 00:36:01.370
but don’t spend a single pai, you see, just manage it.

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:07.540
No! It’s not like that. It’s the other way round!

00:36:10.276 --> 00:36:13.549
It’s again the another dilemma is there that,

00:36:13.629 --> 00:36:23.630
in India which is a place of poverty compare
to all of you, everyone donates money.

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:28.953
All the trustees in every centre
wherever there are trustees,

00:36:29.033 --> 00:36:34.630
have to donate at least five thousand
rupees to become the trustees.

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:38.193
Of course, I don’t get anything out of it,

00:36:38.273 --> 00:36:41.839
but I must have donated I don’t
know how many how much Myself

00:36:41.919 --> 00:36:46.930
to become the Trustee of Sahaja Yogis!

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:50.851
But you have to donate.

00:36:52.643 --> 00:37:00.509
And when you become miserly again that
means, again, it’s the same thing going on.

00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:07.447
You have bank balances, but the
source is finished and you have nothing left.

00:37:07.527 --> 00:37:10.608
The bank balance should be with God.

00:37:10.688 --> 00:37:15.729
Then He gives you interest more than the capital.

00:37:15.809 --> 00:37:19.649
Is there any bank which does that?

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:27.930
At least not the Swiss Bank!

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:33.117
You have to pay for keeping money with them.

00:37:35.323 --> 00:37:39.369
That’s how it is. You should tap.

00:37:39.449 --> 00:37:44.323
Always try to go to the source.

00:37:47.088 --> 00:37:51.339
This becomes subtler and subtler in the sense

00:37:51.419 --> 00:37:56.763
that people think that now
their children are realized souls.

00:37:56.843 --> 00:38:00.844
All right, so what? They are not Gods, are they?

00:38:00.924 --> 00:38:07.488
They get so involved with their children, I
mean, this is another stupidity women fall into.

00:38:07.568 --> 00:38:10.569
But to them their child is so important,

00:38:10.649 --> 00:38:13.045
they get so adhered to the child.

00:38:13.125 --> 00:38:18.237
I mean, first they used to neglect the children,
now they become so attached to their children

00:38:18.317 --> 00:38:23.723
that they look like glued people all the time.

00:38:23.803 --> 00:38:29.630
And such children cannot grow properly
unless and until you give them freedom.

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:32.311
Give them full freedom to grow.

00:38:32.391 --> 00:38:40.936
But guidance, of course, that they are
majestic people, meaning Sahaja Yogis,

00:38:41.016 --> 00:38:46.037
they are born realised as a Sahaja Yogi, as
a good Sahaja Yogi how they should behave.

00:38:46.117 --> 00:38:51.930
Have a rapport, talk to them,
tell them about it, how they be.

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:56.073
Develop that self-respect within
them that they should be like this.

00:38:56.153 --> 00:38:59.485
Not to glue them to you.

00:39:02.083 --> 00:39:06.750
That’s not the way. Children will
never grow properly, even physically,

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:10.070
if you glue them to yourself.

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:16.849
In the West now I see new ideas coming up
that the children must be glued to the mother.

00:39:16.929 --> 00:39:22.194
This is from one extreme to another
extreme.They’ll become very left-sided.

00:39:22.274 --> 00:39:26.784
Even if they’ll be grown up in age
they won’t grow up in their brains.

00:39:26.864 --> 00:39:31.930
They won’t grow up in their behaviour
if they are glued with the mother.

00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:35.930
If they cry for a while, little bit, doesn’t matter,

00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:39.514
but the children must be made to sleep away from the mother.

00:39:39.594 --> 00:39:46.157
All the time you should not carry your
children in your lap. There is no need at all.

00:39:46.237 --> 00:39:53.930
But this is not that the child wants, is
the mother who wants this kind of a thing.

00:39:54.010 --> 00:40:01.929
And some fathers also I have
seen glued down to their children

00:40:04.535 --> 00:40:08.814
and then they say, “Mother, my
child is spoiled, he’s like this, like that.”

00:40:08.894 --> 00:40:13.793
Such children will get possessed very fast
if you make the children dependant on you.

00:40:13.873 --> 00:40:16.955
Very fast they’ll become possessed.

00:40:17.035 --> 00:40:20.930
If you make them over-independent, “You are on your own”,

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:23.930
like the other side was that when we were in Oxted

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:28.358
a girl of seven years used to come and give us newspapers.

00:40:28.438 --> 00:40:31.930
And she was a daughter of a lord!

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:36.670
At about five o’clock in the morning, in
that cold she used to climb up all the way

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:40.128
on a bicycle delivering those newspapers.

00:40:40.209 --> 00:40:43.744
And when I told her mother, “What
are you doing? It’s very dangerous,

00:40:43.825 --> 00:40:47.360
this child is in danger, she is a
girl, how can you do that to her?”

00:40:47.441 --> 00:40:51.930
she said, “No, no, she has to be on her own.”

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:57.735
So, the one side is to be on her
own and another side is to glue them,

00:40:57.815 --> 00:41:02.930
is again the same subtle attitude of
possessiveness. It’s possessiveness,

00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:08.876
"This is my child, I must look after the
child, the child is self-realised soul, this, that.”

00:41:08.956 --> 00:41:15.171
Only your child is not realised soul, everybody’s
child is the realised soul in Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:15.251 --> 00:41:18.103
How much do you do for other’s children?

00:41:18.183 --> 00:41:22.139
Or only you look after your own child?

00:41:22.219 --> 00:41:27.036
The custom should be: if you buy one thing for your child,

00:41:27.116 --> 00:41:31.255
buy two more things for another child.

00:41:31.335 --> 00:41:38.580
Buy better things for another
child and less things for your child.

00:41:40.343 --> 00:41:44.579
Let your child share his things with others.

00:41:44.659 --> 00:41:48.763
At the time when you are buying
something, buy something that he can share.

00:41:48.843 --> 00:41:51.267
Teach him how to share.

00:41:51.347 --> 00:41:56.551
Because though they are realised souls,
with the mothers and the fathers like this

00:41:56.631 --> 00:42:04.207
they’ll become again the same miserly old-style people:

00:42:04.287 --> 00:42:12.570
quarrelsome, fighting, beating each
other, troubling each other. So be careful!

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:21.570
Being realised-souls, you will be surprised, they
will be extremely, extremely convenient for you.

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:25.930
Give them to other Sahaja Yogis to handle, depend on them,

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:28.616
let them look after.

00:42:28.696 --> 00:42:35.516
And the homogeneous feeling comes through
children. Children are the ones who bind each other.

00:42:35.596 --> 00:42:39.069
But, “Don’t touch my child! This is my child!”

00:42:39.149 --> 00:42:42.415
you close the door as soon as somebody comes in.

00:42:42.495 --> 00:42:47.930
That’s you are going back in the
same way as your mothers have been.

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:52.163
There’s no war on in Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:52.243 --> 00:42:56.930
We are in the government of God.

00:42:57.010 --> 00:42:59.200
This realisation has to come.

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:05.927
There is no need to seek all these
useless things, these pleasures of life.

00:43:07.873 --> 00:43:11.499
Understand your responsibility

00:43:11.579 --> 00:43:18.930
that you are Sahaja Yogis first and last and, in the middle

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:22.859
and as Sahaja Yogis what is your duty?

00:43:22.939 --> 00:43:30.797
Is to be completely dedicated for the
betterment and the benevolence of others.

00:43:30.877 --> 00:43:34.623
That’s the only thing which is going to nourish you to rise.

00:43:34.704 --> 00:43:39.028
If you look after your children like
this, like mad, it’s not going to help you .

00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:41.026
You’ll have problems.

00:43:41.106 --> 00:43:46.930
If you neglect your children, you will have problems.

00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:55.142
So come in the centre and be just witnesses of all that.

00:43:58.532 --> 00:44:03.643
It’s a very common failing in the beginning of
every Sahaja Yogi who comes to Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:03.723 --> 00:44:10.178
They’ll send me the list of five generations
on this side and five generations on this side

00:44:10.258 --> 00:44:21.083
"my fathers, brothers, sisters, this thing,
that thing, real cousins, real this thing is sick.

00:44:21.163 --> 00:44:23.751
So please, Mother, put Your attention.”

00:44:23.831 --> 00:44:30.179
And when I put my attention, the
attention returns back, I can’t find that.

00:44:30.259 --> 00:44:32.659
It starts like that to begin with. Alright,

00:44:32.739 --> 00:44:36.087
in the beginning I say, “Alright,
just now they have entered.”

00:44:36.167 --> 00:44:40.139
"But you don’t know", these are
tentacles which keep you down,

00:44:40.219 --> 00:44:45.441
they do not allow you to rise in the domain of God.

00:44:45.521 --> 00:44:51.386
In the domain of God everything
that is yours, even your hair,

00:44:51.466 --> 00:44:56.060
are looked after by God Almighty.

00:44:56.140 --> 00:45:00.930
Every thing! Can you understand that? Can you realise that?

00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:12.010
Is all done by billions and billions
and billions of powers of Adi Shakti.

00:45:17.294 --> 00:45:23.544
What can you do yourself? Nothing!
Except for worrying and troubling.

00:45:23.624 --> 00:45:32.583
So just if you believe and assume that power today

00:45:32.663 --> 00:45:37.132
that you are in the domain of God,

00:45:37.212 --> 00:45:41.420
which is active benevolence,

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:46.386
the nature of it is active benevolence

00:45:46.466 --> 00:45:50.797
as we say ‘hita’ (हित).

00:45:54.404 --> 00:45:58.011
If you are sick, it is for your benevolence.

00:45:58.091 --> 00:46:01.498
If you are alright, it is for your benevolence.

00:46:01.578 --> 00:46:09.044
If you have money, it is for your benevolence. If
you don’t have money, it is for your benevolence.

00:46:10.583 --> 00:46:17.628
Everything does good for you in the domain of God.

00:46:17.708 --> 00:46:23.443
Do not judge it according to your own standards.

00:46:23.523 --> 00:46:31.242
Whom do you think to be a person who
is benevolent in this world apart from Me?

00:46:31.322 --> 00:46:35.540
Really, in the real sense of the word?

00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:39.303
Supposing you take a man who is very rich;

00:46:39.383 --> 00:46:41.751
is he benevolent?

00:46:41.831 --> 00:46:48.963
No. Is he happy? No. Is he respected? No.

00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:59.930
At least he has to be a realised soul
to be somewhere near that description.

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:03.466
And if you have to ascend in the domain of God,

00:47:03.546 --> 00:47:07.547
you have to know that everything works through His power:

00:47:07.627 --> 00:47:16.777
your activity, your inactivity, your sleep,
everything is worked through His powers of love.

00:47:16.857 --> 00:47:22.203
Love can never harm, can never destroy.

00:47:22.283 --> 00:47:27.623
You go a little ahead with it

00:47:27.703 --> 00:47:33.703
and it showers flowers upon you.

00:47:36.919 --> 00:47:42.001
But understand your nature:
supposing you are a left-sided person.

00:47:42.081 --> 00:47:47.375
Mostly I’ve seen left sided
persons always want to do my pujas.

00:47:47.455 --> 00:47:53.120
And the right-sided person are
organising. Do the other way round.

00:47:53.200 --> 00:48:01.693
must know your nature, give yourself a
balance, and then enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:48:01.773 --> 00:48:05.133
Like you're entering into a door, say for example,

00:48:05.213 --> 00:48:07.727
and you have too much load on your back,

00:48:07.807 --> 00:48:09.849
meaning you are a left-sided person.

00:48:09.929 --> 00:48:17.483
Then take down the load from
your back on your head and enter in.

00:48:17.563 --> 00:48:24.015
But if you have too much on your
head, put it on your back and enter in.

00:48:24.095 --> 00:48:26.893
Because you’re tired. You do it every day.

00:48:26.973 --> 00:48:31.225
Supposing this hand is tired, you put it on the left hand.

00:48:31.305 --> 00:48:35.489
I see in aeroplane when people are
walking, they are holding it in one hand

00:48:35.569 --> 00:48:38.890
and automatically when it is tired, they put it to the left.

00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:42.010
Automatically. They are not Sahaja Yogis!

00:48:43.255 --> 00:48:48.773
In the same way in life also, if you
have done one-sidedness too much,

00:48:48.853 --> 00:48:53.853
try to do the other side and give yourself a balance.

00:48:57.217 --> 00:49:01.717
Navaratri is the day to give you the balance.

00:49:01.797 --> 00:49:08.493
Those whose right hand is tired
will get the power in the left hand.

00:49:08.573 --> 00:49:17.961
Those who have the left hand tired will get
the power on the right hand to share the load.

00:49:19.374 --> 00:49:27.930
So those who are having money
problems will solve their money problems.

00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:34.394
And those who have sleeping problems
will solve their sleeping problems.

00:49:34.474 --> 00:49:40.592
But one can say if somebody has both, then what do they do?

00:49:40.672 --> 00:49:44.930
I know of somebody, I lived there, in that country

00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:53.388
where they have both the problems, they sleep as
well as they have no money, and they are not bothered!

00:50:05.010 --> 00:50:08.410
So, for such people what should we do?

00:50:08.490 --> 00:50:15.199
Of course, I won’t tell you, but
one has to do something about it!

00:50:20.410 --> 00:50:24.238
One has to work out something.

00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:28.554
They just don’t move

00:50:28.634 --> 00:50:33.314
and if you tell them, answer
is, “I know. I know I sleep a lot;

00:50:33.394 --> 00:50:37.395
I know I’m like this. I know. I know.”

00:50:37.475 --> 00:50:40.783
That’s all. Then what do you say?

00:50:40.863 --> 00:50:48.953
It stops you completely. You can’t go
further. If they know, what more to be told?

00:50:51.089 --> 00:51:01.089
This is a complete mountain there
standing just to finish you completely.

00:51:10.596 --> 00:51:14.257
So, one has to do.

00:51:14.337 --> 00:51:16.643
Everyone has to do something.

00:51:16.723 --> 00:51:19.795
Somebody is working it out,

00:51:19.875 --> 00:51:22.730
somebody is doing some work,

00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:25.242
and another is not helping.

00:51:25.322 --> 00:51:33.074
Then that cannot be completed, it’s a collective
work, you cannot! One person cannot do it.

00:51:33.154 --> 00:51:37.617
I’ve seen it happens like this. It’s a collective work.

00:51:37.697 --> 00:51:43.698
So, we come to the position that Navaratri
today is not the work of Mother only,

00:51:43.778 --> 00:51:48.161
which She did so far, is the work of every one of you.

00:51:48.241 --> 00:51:52.117
I cannot do it single-handed.

00:51:52.197 --> 00:51:55.269
If I could, there was no need for you to be here,

00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:58.048
I would have built the aeroplane, put you there,

00:51:58.129 --> 00:52:03.809
pushed them some or other, lock it
up and put you there. It’s not possible.

00:52:03.889 --> 00:52:07.230
You all have to carry your own aeroplanes.

00:52:07.310 --> 00:52:10.929
Build it up and carry it yourself with dignity,

00:52:11.009 --> 00:52:14.323
not like small children. So, you have to mature.

00:52:14.403 --> 00:52:18.786
And for that maturity it’s a
collective thing that has to take place.

00:52:18.866 --> 00:52:23.843
In the beginning in the school, alright,
they’ll teach you two plus two is equal to four.

00:52:23.923 --> 00:52:28.912
But when you go to the college, you have to do it yourself,

00:52:28.992 --> 00:52:31.990
solve the problem yourself.

00:52:32.070 --> 00:52:35.305
And that’s what it is today. Sahaja Yoga is good,

00:52:35.385 --> 00:52:40.548
you get your Realisation in these modern times, but

00:52:40.628 --> 00:52:43.811
the maturity has to take place,

00:52:43.891 --> 00:52:45.811
otherwise useless.

00:52:45.891 --> 00:52:49.810
Up to the seed it was alright, but once it is sprouted

00:52:49.890 --> 00:52:54.730
it must become the tree, otherwise it’s useless.

00:52:54.810 --> 00:52:57.730
And that all of you have to do together,

00:52:57.810 --> 00:53:00.410
helping each other, understanding each other.

00:53:00.490 --> 00:53:04.404
And everyone has to work it out.

00:53:04.484 --> 00:53:09.325
Even if one person suffers, I suffer.

00:53:13.296 --> 00:53:17.296
The whole thing has become collective.

00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:23.098
The Devi has become collective.

00:53:24.130 --> 00:53:26.767
It’s a venture.

00:53:28.429 --> 00:53:33.436
It’s a venture, I know, too much
of it. There was no other way out.

00:53:33.516 --> 00:53:42.753
It’s like crucifixion of every part of
Your body, every cell of Your body.

00:53:44.810 --> 00:53:47.700
But it’s alright.

00:53:50.707 --> 00:53:53.451
So today, instead of feeling guilty,

00:53:53.531 --> 00:54:00.402
you should be filled with tremendous
courage and tremendous enthusiasm:

00:54:00.482 --> 00:54:04.819
that we have to do it, because
Mother has given us the power.

00:54:04.899 --> 00:54:08.170
We can do it; nothing should keep us down.

00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:11.138
And we are going to help each other.

00:54:11.218 --> 00:54:17.202
One person is doing one job, nobody
will look at it, you see, they won’t just move!

00:54:17.282 --> 00:54:22.282
"I know, I’m sitting down, I
know. I don’t do anything I know.”

00:54:25.177 --> 00:54:28.178
And in Sahaja Yoga, it has become even subtler,

00:54:28.258 --> 00:54:34.163
"I want to do but there’s a bhoot in
me which doesn’t allow me to do it.”

00:54:34.243 --> 00:54:37.418
So, you get out with your bhoot!

00:54:37.498 --> 00:54:39.827
That’s what it is.

00:54:41.156 --> 00:54:51.343
All these arguments are stupid, of no value in Sahaja Yoga.

00:54:51.423 --> 00:54:55.327
That means you have not understood
the meaning of Sahaja Yoga,

00:54:55.407 --> 00:54:58.457
you have not understood the meaning of yourself,

00:54:58.537 --> 00:55:01.131
and you have no respect for your life.

00:55:01.211 --> 00:55:03.087
That’s what it is.

00:55:03.167 --> 00:55:06.730
If you indulge into such thinking, then it is no good.

00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:12.523
But today you have to promise to
yourself and to me within your heart

00:55:12.603 --> 00:55:19.282
that you are going to be filled
with that enthusiasm and that shakti.

00:55:20.290 --> 00:55:23.290
The time has come.

00:55:28.896 --> 00:55:33.896
Which is going to make you real yogis.

00:55:36.343 --> 00:55:38.730
Complete dedication.

00:55:38.810 --> 00:55:43.886
Imagine these PLO people what they are doing, fearlessly.

00:55:43.966 --> 00:55:46.523
I mean, all kinds of people you see around you

00:55:46.603 --> 00:55:50.040
even in Kali Yuga are so dedicated to something nonsensical.

00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:55.600
Why can’t we be dedicated to something so sensible?

00:55:57.810 --> 00:56:00.839
They are not afraid of anything,

00:56:00.919 --> 00:56:03.396
they are dare devils.

00:56:03.476 --> 00:56:06.729
Why can’t we become like that?

00:56:07.908 --> 00:56:11.063
What’s wrong with us?

00:56:11.143 --> 00:56:18.068
So, every one of us must have that
enthusiasm and “I’m an institution by myself.

00:56:18.148 --> 00:56:22.503
And I’m going to do it, I’m not going
to take advantage of the ashram life,

00:56:22.583 --> 00:56:26.257
nicely settled down in the
ashram. You see very good, cheap.”

00:56:26.337 --> 00:56:30.730
No! We are all going to move out also

00:56:30.810 --> 00:56:33.105
and take up a place somewhere else.

00:56:33.185 --> 00:56:35.564
For the time being ashram is alright.

00:56:35.644 --> 00:56:38.371
But then give more room to others who are coming.

00:56:38.451 --> 00:56:43.854
You get out of it. Go out and
stay somewhere and work it out.

00:56:45.003 --> 00:56:48.730
Then in the ashram, “This is my
house, I have spent money for this,

00:56:48.810 --> 00:56:53.179
this is my furniture, this is this thing, that thing.”

00:56:55.170 --> 00:57:03.689
Actually, you should know how to live on a
string, shoestring, as they say, on a shoestring.

00:57:03.769 --> 00:57:09.769
Of course, now I’m feeling that every ashram has
such a lot of furniture that they had to [UNCLEAR].

00:57:11.509 --> 00:57:14.509
Better live on a shoestring.

00:57:16.754 --> 00:57:20.057
So the tapasya starts.

00:57:20.137 --> 00:57:22.849
Go into a penance yourself.

00:57:22.929 --> 00:57:27.000
But then I will hear, “Mother, I’m
on a tapasya, I’m eating only once.”

00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:32.539
Why? Who ask you to be on
tapasya? Enjoy! Enjoy your tapasya!

00:57:32.619 --> 00:57:35.825
Then it is Sahaja, otherwise: nonsense.

00:57:35.905 --> 00:57:39.853
Enjoy. If you can enjoy your tapasya then you are sahaj;

00:57:39.933 --> 00:57:44.746
With enthusiasm. Look at these PLOs,

00:57:44.826 --> 00:57:47.826
look at these people,

00:57:50.313 --> 00:57:56.359
do they say, "We are going in a tapasya”? Nothing.

00:57:56.439 --> 00:58:00.680
You have examples of people around you.

00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:03.680
But we can’t say they are possessed by bhoots.

00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:11.158
Or even if they are what about you? You
better get possessed by sahaj bhoots for a change!

00:58:12.353 --> 00:58:17.118
If that’s the way, only, you can be motivated.

00:58:21.446 --> 00:58:29.384
So, tell your mind, “No explanations,
nothing doing. I am going to show my worth!”

00:58:35.419 --> 00:58:41.533
But all the time if the attention is just to show off

00:58:41.613 --> 00:58:45.911
or to be in my attention

00:58:45.991 --> 00:58:54.763
or to be in contact with me, to be writing to
me or something, is not going to help at all.

00:58:57.327 --> 00:59:04.415
I am just a mirror, and you see
within myself yourself, in the true way.

00:59:04.495 --> 00:59:10.078
And also, this mirror, is full of maya.

00:59:10.158 --> 00:59:20.079
So, a devil may look into this mirror,
and may look like a saint to him.

00:59:20.159 --> 00:59:25.773
If he has ego, he might look like a saint to himself.

00:59:25.853 --> 00:59:37.370
Or if he is a left-sided person he might think
he is the incarnation of Bhairava – he might.

00:59:41.483 --> 00:59:51.906
But if he is truthful, he can see clearly that
he is the highest of highest, he's a sahaja yogi

00:59:51.986 --> 00:59:58.850
And unless and until you see
yourself like that, know that it’s a maya.

01:00:02.523 --> 01:00:08.561
So, to realise that you have achieved
a lot by getting your Realisation,

01:00:08.641 --> 01:00:12.298
of rising so much higher above all these petty ideas.

01:00:12.378 --> 01:00:17.317
Every idea is petty, whether it is
economics, politics, philosophy,

01:00:17.397 --> 01:00:23.729
any ism, anything is all petty for a Sahaja Yogi,

01:00:25.321 --> 01:00:30.332
because none of them know even this much about God’s domain.

01:00:30.412 --> 01:00:35.326
What are they talking about is economics!

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:42.106
They do not know anything about His politics.

01:00:42.186 --> 01:00:47.313
They do not know anything that there is a miraculous power

01:00:47.393 --> 01:00:52.046
which rules the whole Universe,

01:00:52.126 --> 01:00:57.910
and which is so efficient. Which never fails.

01:00:57.990 --> 01:01:05.524
So timely, so sensible, so interesting, dramatic.

01:01:05.604 --> 01:01:09.020
See how we reserved all these things in no time.

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:13.311
How we got to this place. I was to have this puja here.

01:01:13.391 --> 01:01:16.290
All this you know. How I came here.

01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:20.888
See the miracle working. How the
powers of the Divine are working.

01:01:20.968 --> 01:01:24.109
You be the proper instrument of the Divine.

01:01:24.189 --> 01:01:26.844
And it has another force as I told you

01:01:26.924 --> 01:01:32.390
centripetal and centrifugal – and you might be thrown out.

01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:37.743
So be careful on that point. Face yourself in truthfulness!

01:01:37.823 --> 01:01:42.513
Do not get pampered by your ego or morosed by your superego!

01:01:42.593 --> 01:01:47.599
Just see for yourself as a powerful instrument of love.

01:01:47.679 --> 01:01:52.537
But in love you do not become indiscrete.

01:01:52.617 --> 01:02:00.617
Steadily, beautifully, gently you attend to it.

01:02:02.393 --> 01:02:09.307
And so much power can be born.

01:02:09.387 --> 01:02:14.006
You will be amazed that water, which
looks something so frivolous to us,

01:02:14.086 --> 01:02:17.586
has so much power in it.

01:02:17.666 --> 01:02:21.512
You know about hydrostatics.

01:02:23.529 --> 01:02:27.449
This Mother Earth which looks so simple:

01:02:27.529 --> 01:02:31.401
We walk on Her on our feet. She attracts us on ourself.

01:02:31.481 --> 01:02:34.482
She’s spinning with such a speed Herself,

01:02:34.562 --> 01:02:38.009
She keeps us sticking on to Her.

01:02:38.089 --> 01:02:42.558
She’s doing thousands and thousands of tremendous jobs,

01:02:42.638 --> 01:02:46.680
this great Mother Earth She looks so simple.

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:50.984
She’s so powerful. In the same way you are made out of

01:02:51.064 --> 01:02:55.343
this Ganesha Tattwa which is so tremendous.

01:02:59.143 --> 01:03:03.144
This Navaratri should give you that power,

01:03:03.224 --> 01:03:08.546
those nine powers of nine chakras.

01:03:08.626 --> 01:03:14.314
Seven chakras: you already know.

01:03:14.394 --> 01:03:19.673
Above that you become the master yourself,

01:03:19.753 --> 01:03:24.753
and then you become the Power yourself.

01:03:32.453 --> 01:03:34.828
May God bless you!
