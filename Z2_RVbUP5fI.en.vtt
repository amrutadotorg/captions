WEBVTT

00:02.413 --> 00:08.413
Today is a great day of Navaratri,

00:09.413 --> 00:14.913
we are sitting on the cusp of the sixth and the seventh.

00:14.913 --> 00:23.913
Sixth and the seventh is the day when Mahasaraswati

00:23.913 --> 00:28.913
finished Her work

00:28.913 --> 00:33.913
and the incarnation of the Shakti itself started.

00:33.913 --> 00:39.413
So, at twelve o’clock today the Devi takes the Shakti upon Herself.

00:39.413 --> 00:48.413
Of course, as you know that Mahakali and Mahasaraswati,

00:48.413 --> 01:00.413
both are the powers of Shri Sadashiva.

01:00.413 --> 01:08.413
Adi Shakti first formed Herself into Mahakali,

01:08.413 --> 01:13.413
which is the Power of Desire.

01:13.413 --> 01:18.413
But all these powers are nothing

01:18.413 --> 01:25.413
but the power of God’s love.

01:25.413 --> 01:36.413
So, in the series of this great love of God,

01:36.413 --> 01:42.413
Adi Shakti had to first become the Power of Desire.

01:42.413 --> 01:43.413
In the same way,

01:43.413 --> 01:48.413
Sahaja Yogis who are bestowed with this power of love

01:48.413 --> 01:53.413
have to have full desire in their heart.

01:53.413 --> 02:00.413
Desire to love.

02:00.413 --> 02:07.413
That desire is very different from

02:07.413 --> 02:12.413
the other kinds of human love we have known.

02:12.413 --> 02:16.413
In other kinds of human love,

02:16.413 --> 02:19.413
when we have relations with others,

02:19.413 --> 02:23.413
we have expectations,

02:24.413 --> 02:29.413
and that’s why it is very disappointing.

02:29.413 --> 02:33.413
Our expectations always run higher

02:33.413 --> 02:39.413
than our understanding and realities.

02:39.413 --> 02:44.413
And so we suffer from disappointments and frustrations.

02:44.413 --> 02:50.913
And the love that has to be nourishing and fulfilling

02:50.913 --> 02:54.913
becomes a thankless job.

02:54.913 --> 02:59.913
So, when it reflects in the human beings,

02:59.913 --> 03:04.913
it is the desire to be loved by everyone,

03:04.913 --> 03:08.913
not to love others.

03:08.913 --> 03:11.913
Everyone should love you,

03:11.913 --> 03:15.913
but how far you love another is the point.

03:15.913 --> 03:18.913
Naturally everyone for oneself!

03:18.913 --> 03:21.913
So really nobody loves.

03:21.913 --> 03:26.913
But when it comes to real love

03:26.913 --> 03:32.913
then sacrifice, becomes a nature.

03:32.913 --> 03:36.913
You don’t call it a sacrifice but you call it a privilege.

03:36.913 --> 03:41.913
We say it’s a privilege to give love.

03:41.913 --> 03:46.913
It’s a great chance that we can love.

03:46.913 --> 03:51.913
It’s our great fortune that we can love.

03:51.913 --> 03:56.913
It’s God’s blessings that we can love and give.

03:56.913 --> 04:02.913
So the giving starts when you realise,

04:02.913 --> 04:06.913
not understand but realise the love,

04:06.913 --> 04:10.913
the power of love expressing .

04:10.913 --> 04:14.913
That’s the third power, which starts expressing .

04:14.913 --> 04:16.913
Because, after this,

04:16.913 --> 04:20.913
a person becomes active, kriyasheet.

04:20.913 --> 04:24.913
That’s how the action of

04:24.913 --> 04:29.913
achieving that state of giving love starts.

04:29.913 --> 04:33.913
To begin with we start activating in so many ways.

04:33.913 --> 04:39.913
As I said, we start expecting

04:39.913 --> 04:46.913
and thinking that we are loving others.

04:46.913 --> 04:50.913
We act for that.

04:50.913 --> 04:54.913
In that madness that others should love us,

04:54.913 --> 04:56.913
others should respect us,

04:56.913 --> 04:58.913
others should think we are great,

04:58.913 --> 05:00.913
they should recognise us

05:00.913 --> 05:05.913
we start loving something else which is not so important.

05:05.913 --> 05:10.913
So, we go on first to money,

05:10.913 --> 05:13.913
money becomes a very important point.

05:13.913 --> 05:19.913
We think that, if we have money, people will love us.

05:19.913 --> 05:23.913
We become very powerful as moneyed people,

05:23.913 --> 05:26.913
as rich people.

05:26.913 --> 05:28.913
So we start accumulating money,

05:28.913 --> 05:35.913
we start loving the money.

05:35.913 --> 05:38.913
But money is not the Truth;

05:38.913 --> 05:40.913
we don’t love the Truth.

05:40.913 --> 05:43.913
When we start loving the money

05:43.913 --> 05:46.913
we start thinking about problems of money.

05:46.913 --> 05:54.913
Such people can become miserly to such an extent

05:54.913 --> 05:57.913
that even towards God they become miserly.

05:57.913 --> 05:58.913
They never have money actually,

05:58.913 --> 06:01.913
because if you cannot spend your money, you have no money.

06:01.913 --> 06:06.913
If it is not available what’s the use of having all the money?

06:06.913 --> 06:09.913
That’s how they have problems

06:09.913 --> 06:16.913
because they love money and not the God Almighty.

06:16.913 --> 06:22.913
They’re worried about money but not about the Truth.

06:22.913 --> 06:27.913
Then with that they go to a second thing: is the power.

06:27.913 --> 06:30.913
They want to have the power;

06:30.913 --> 06:32.913
they want to become presidents,

06:33.063 --> 06:37.913
ministers and bureaucrats and all that.

06:37.913 --> 06:40.913
They want to have the power:

06:40.913 --> 06:43.913
they think by having great power

06:43.913 --> 06:45.913
people will respect them and love them.

06:45.913 --> 06:50.913
But they get drowned in fear.

06:50.913 --> 06:54.913
What they get is fear. All the time they have fear.

06:54.913 --> 06:57.913
Also moneyed people have fear.

06:57.913 --> 07:03.913
That’s why in the Bible it is said that: wages of sin is fear.

07:03.913 --> 07:08.913
What is sin? Sin is not to love the Truth.

07:08.913 --> 07:12.913
Is the sin. When you don’t love the Truth then it is sin.

07:12.913 --> 07:18.913
So when you start getting worried about your positions…

07:18.913 --> 07:24.913
Like the president feels that he’ll lose his job,

07:24.913 --> 07:31.913
the vice president thinks that he’ll be sacked,

07:31.913 --> 07:36.913
the prime minister thinks he may not be elected,

07:36.913 --> 07:40.913
the bureaucrats think they will lose their jobs,

07:40.913 --> 07:42.913
they won’t get promotions or something,

07:42.913 --> 07:44.913
there will be problem.

07:44.913 --> 07:48.913
All these people are suffering from terrible sense of fear.

07:48.913 --> 07:51.913
They have no freedom of any kind.

07:51.913 --> 07:56.913
And in that category people just go down so much with fear,

07:56.913 --> 08:00.913
that even worse than people with money.

08:00.913 --> 08:03.913
Because once they are lost they are lost.

08:03.913 --> 08:07.913
They can never revive. No chance.

08:07.913 --> 08:09.913
Once you lose the elections you are lost,

08:09.913 --> 08:10.913
nobody is going to look at you.

08:10.913 --> 08:14.913
I have known people who have been at a very high position

08:14.913 --> 08:19.913
and once they lose that position nobody looks at them,

08:19.913 --> 08:20.913
they just walk like straight,

08:20.913 --> 08:24.913
otherwise there will be at least hundred cars to receive them.

08:24.913 --> 08:28.913
And once they lose their jobs there’s nobody even to look at them.

08:28.913 --> 08:31.913
They just walk like ordinary people.

08:31.913 --> 08:34.913
Even seeing all these things happening,

08:34.913 --> 08:40.913
this truth just coming before them so clearly,

08:40.913 --> 08:44.913
they do not keep to that truth,

08:44.913 --> 08:47.913
they do not realise that truth,

08:47.913 --> 08:53.913
they do not have that realisation within them.

08:53.913 --> 08:58.913
They understand for a while and they go after that.

08:58.913 --> 09:01.913
Then when the person dies,

09:01.913 --> 09:07.913
they see a moneyed man, a rich man is forgotten,

09:07.913 --> 09:11.913
nobody is bothered about them, who was a rich man.

09:11.913 --> 09:13.913
On the contrary, the people,

09:13.913 --> 09:17.913
the prime ministers and all those high-ranking people, when they die,

09:17.913 --> 09:21.913
immediately books start coming out about their private life:

09:21.913 --> 09:25.913
all the dirty things they did

09:25.913 --> 09:30.913
and all the horrible things they did and what sort of life they led

09:30.913 --> 09:32.913
There’s no fragrance in their life,

09:32.913 --> 09:36.913
no idealism. Nothing.

09:36.913 --> 09:39.913
Because the responsibility

09:39.913 --> 09:42.913
that they have to the public

09:42.913 --> 09:46.913
and to themselves they have not understood it

09:46.913 --> 09:49.913
and they made a mess of their private life.

09:49.913 --> 09:55.913
That’s why this kind of a reaction comes after it.

09:55.913 --> 09:58.913
The other day I was reading

09:58.913 --> 10:02.913
an interview with a very well-known actor.

10:02.913 --> 10:06.913
He’s a born realised fellow, I know, but he’s gone down completely.

10:06.913 --> 10:09.913
He says, “I think, what’s the harm in drinking,

10:09.913 --> 10:11.913
what’s the harm in gambling,?

10:11.913 --> 10:13.913
what’s the harm in smoking?

10:13.913 --> 10:17.913
Because, after all, I’m going to die

10:17.913 --> 10:22.913
and then who is going to bother?

10:22.913 --> 10:24.913
Supposing, I get cancer, so what?

10:24.913 --> 10:26.913
In any case I’m going to die.

10:26.913 --> 10:29.613
So why not enjoy these pleasures of life?”

10:29.613 --> 10:35.613
But what about death? You continue with it.

10:35.613 --> 10:39.613
Then all that you’ve been doing will come out,

10:39.613 --> 10:45.613
and people will not to like to have your photograph in the household.

10:45.613 --> 10:48.613
Children will spit at you. What about that?

10:48.613 --> 10:53.613
Your life is not what it is today for three, four years or ten years

10:53.613 --> 10:56.613
or fifteen years of your so-called success.

10:56.613 --> 10:58.613
But when you die

10:58.613 --> 11:02.613
all this craziness will disappear,

11:02.613 --> 11:06.613
and people will come out with truth about you.

11:06.613 --> 11:12.613
That is how this power to be popular finishes off.

11:12.613 --> 11:16.613
This cheap popularity,

11:16.613 --> 11:24.613
this cheap type of treatment towards yourself

11:24.613 --> 11:30.613
gives you a personality that will not be worshipped,

11:30.613 --> 11:33.613
that will not be accepted.

11:33.613 --> 11:36.613
Nobody will quote you as something great.

11:36.613 --> 11:38.613
For some time, it will continue,

11:38.613 --> 11:44.613
but in totality such a person has given nothing to humanity.

11:44.613 --> 11:51.613
That’s how the power of Saraswati works.

11:51.613 --> 11:53.613
People go into action

11:53.613 --> 12:02.613
for achieving the results of getting into power.

12:02.613 --> 12:08.613
But it should act to discover the truth.

12:08.613 --> 12:18.613
Saraswati should give you the leap to find out the truth.

12:18.613 --> 12:25.613
That, when you act in those funny places and streets,

12:25.613 --> 12:28.613
you discover this is not the path, we have missed it.

12:28.613 --> 12:33.613
The path is somewhere else. We’ve lost it.

12:33.613 --> 12:36.613
Let us find out the real path because this doesn’t give joy.

12:36.613 --> 12:38.613
This one can learn from others,

12:38.613 --> 12:43.613
from history, from so many other things and from your own parents,

12:43.613 --> 12:49.613
from your society and from yourself and from your children also.

12:49.613 --> 12:51.613
If you want to learn,

12:51.613 --> 12:55.613
that is the quality of Saraswati pujaris,

12:55.613 --> 13:00.613
that they take to gyana, they take to reality.

13:00.613 --> 13:03.613
Vedas, in the beginning of the Vedas,

13:03.613 --> 13:05.613
it’s said that:

13:05.613 --> 13:09.613
if by reading these four Vedas,

13:09.613 --> 13:13.613
if you do not get the veeda,

13:13.613 --> 13:18.613
veeda is the knowledge on your nerves, means Realisation,

13:18.613 --> 13:27.613
there is no use reading these Vedas.

13:27.613 --> 13:35.613
So the Saraswati’s first thing is that through the reading,

13:35.613 --> 13:40.613
through the process of Saraswati’s manifestation,

13:40.613 --> 13:45.613
you must reach a point to understand that this is a rat-race,

13:45.613 --> 13:46.613
and we have to get out of it.

13:46.613 --> 13:48.613
We have to step out.

13:48.613 --> 13:50.613
When that happens,

13:50.613 --> 13:53.613
then the Mahalakshmi Tattwa starts working in you,

13:53.613 --> 13:58.613
that is the third tattwa, which starts working.

14:03.613 --> 14:05.613
Mahalakshmi Tattwa

14:05.613 --> 14:10.613
then starts expressing its love in its full extent

14:10.613 --> 14:15.613
through evolutionary process in human beings.

14:15.613 --> 14:19.613
He starts evolving simultaneously.

14:19.613 --> 14:23.613
He sees on both the sides what’s happening,

14:23.613 --> 14:31.613
like a witness and he uses his Mahalakshmi power.

14:31.613 --> 14:35.613
In the first part of the Mahalakshmi power

14:35.613 --> 14:43.613
he starts getting out of the common rut of the family bondages

14:43.613 --> 14:51.613
and the other human bondages of power,

14:51.613 --> 14:54.613
money, lust

14:54.613 --> 14:59.613
and he starts moving on a higher plane.

14:59.613 --> 15:07.613
He gives us a new idea of popularity

15:07.613 --> 15:12.613
by establishing the Truth.

15:12.613 --> 15:15.613
Because through Mahalakshmi power

15:15.613 --> 15:21.613
you discover the Truth on your central nervous system

15:21.613 --> 15:32.613
and ultimately it is the light of an enlightened brain.

15:35.613 --> 15:40.613
When the Mahalakshmi power starts manifesting,

15:40.613 --> 15:45.613
one starts thinking of others.

15:45.613 --> 15:48.613
Not on material level,

15:48.613 --> 15:50.613
that materially people are suffering,

15:50.613 --> 15:53.613
“Now there are people in Ethiopia, who will save?

15:53.613 --> 15:55.613
We must give them some food, this, that.

15:55.613 --> 16:01.613
” No! They go to the roots of the problems. Why?

16:01.613 --> 16:03.613
Or they don’t think there should be

16:03.613 --> 16:06.613
equal distribution of money and wealth.

16:06.613 --> 16:09.613
No. This is superficial.

16:09.613 --> 16:16.613
Because wherever it is done people are not happy.

16:17.613 --> 16:21.613
They feel they have no freedom.

16:23.613 --> 16:26.613
Those people who have money are not happy

16:26.613 --> 16:31.613
because they have a demonic life.

16:31.613 --> 16:35.613
Where they are free they behave like devils.

16:35.613 --> 16:37.613
No sense of totality,

16:37.613 --> 16:40.613
no sense of collectivity.

16:40.613 --> 16:44.613
When they become like that,

16:48.613 --> 16:54.613
they even do not realise that they have become demonic.

16:54.613 --> 17:00.613
Everything becomes like a big martyrdom.

17:01.613 --> 17:03.613
They fight for lands,

17:03.613 --> 17:05.613
they fight for nations,

17:05.613 --> 17:09.613
they fight for rights.

17:09.613 --> 17:12.613
And they do all kinds of horrible things.

17:12.613 --> 17:19.613
Start destroying people, human beings.

17:19.613 --> 17:24.613
All the turmoil of today is the effect of

17:25.613 --> 17:27.613
mostly in the West,

17:27.613 --> 17:31.613
and also all the Arabic countries,

17:31.613 --> 17:35.613
I would say – is of the right side.

17:36.613 --> 17:42.613
And in the East, it is of the left side - the turmoils.

17:42.613 --> 17:47.613
It’s very surprising that

17:47.613 --> 17:49.613
it’s very contrasting also.

17:49.613 --> 17:51.613
It’s a funny dilemma for Me,

17:51.613 --> 17:54.613
I can’t understand it sometimes

17:54.613 --> 17:58.613
that where they are so particular about the chastity,

18:03.613 --> 18:10.613
they become when they are so much worried about chastity and everything,

18:10.613 --> 18:13.613
that they should have problem of the left side.

18:13.613 --> 18:16.613
They do puja, they have shraddha,

18:16.613 --> 18:18.613
they are like Catholics, we can say,

18:18.613 --> 18:19.613
are never rich people,

18:19.613 --> 18:24.613
seldom, except in Switzerland,

18:24.613 --> 18:26.613
I think, here everybody’s rich

18:27.613 --> 18:30.613
because they are so money-oriented.

18:33.613 --> 18:38.613
So, or the people where they are right sided,

18:40.613 --> 18:43.613
when they neglect their chastity,

18:45.613 --> 18:48.613
not bothered about the right side,

18:49.613 --> 18:53.613
they have the problems of the right side,

18:55.613 --> 18:57.613
is very surprising.

18:58.613 --> 19:03.613
The reason is where they look after the chastity part

19:04.613 --> 19:07.613
they go too much into it.

19:10.613 --> 19:15.613
Now, supposing a person is doing a puja.

19:17.613 --> 19:21.613
He just goes on doing puja, puja, puja morning till evening,

19:21.613 --> 19:23.613
without any activity.

19:23.613 --> 19:25.613
Very easy to do puja, isn’t it?

19:25.613 --> 19:27.613
Just come down,

19:27.613 --> 19:29.613
somebody does puja for you, get the vibrations,

19:29.613 --> 19:31.613
nicely blessed, go home.

19:31.613 --> 19:32.613
Nothing to be done,

19:33.613 --> 19:35.613
no activity.

19:36.613 --> 19:39.613
So there is no balance.

19:39.613 --> 19:44.613
So they do puja and they think, “Oh, they have done very well.”

19:44.613 --> 19:47.613
No, if you are a right sided person,

19:48.613 --> 19:50.613
then puja will help you,

19:50.613 --> 19:52.613
but not if you are a left sided person.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.613
Puja does help,

19:59.613 --> 20:01.613
of course, My Puja will help, no doubt,

20:01.613 --> 20:02.613
in both the sides,

20:02.613 --> 20:06.613
because I’m neither left nor right nor anywhere.

20:18.613 --> 20:22.613
So the puja part when they do …

20:22.613 --> 20:28.613
supposing a man is doing a puja to a Devi.

20:28.613 --> 20:34.613
In India they take a great courage to do puja to a Devi,

20:34.613 --> 20:35.613
you do not know that.

20:35.613 --> 20:37.613
Saptashati. That’s where we have

20:37.613 --> 20:39.613
that thing that the way people do,

20:39.613 --> 20:41.613
they get possessed,

20:41.613 --> 20:42.613
they can’t understand.

20:42.613 --> 20:45.613
First of all, they have a statue of someone

20:45.613 --> 20:47.613
made by some horrible fellow.

20:47.613 --> 20:50.613
When they will do the puja of that Goddess,

20:50.613 --> 20:52.613
they are God-fearing,

20:52.613 --> 20:54.613
everything is good,

20:54.613 --> 20:58.613
we have got temples where there are also,

20:58.613 --> 21:01.613
we can say, swayambhus

21:03.613 --> 21:05.613
from the Mother Earth,

21:05.613 --> 21:07.613
which are worshipped

21:07.613 --> 21:08.613
and should be all right,

21:08.613 --> 21:11.613
but no, they get possessed. Why?

21:12.613 --> 21:14.613
Because most of them,

21:14.613 --> 21:20.613
these temples are hounded by or haunted by spirits.

21:20.613 --> 21:23.613
Because they do all kinds of tantaric things there.

21:23.613 --> 21:26.613
And when people go and do the pujas there

21:26.613 --> 21:29.613
what happens to them?

21:29.613 --> 21:32.613
That they get attacked,

21:34.613 --> 21:36.613
they become more left sided.

21:38.613 --> 21:42.613
Now the Muslims and others who believe in a God

21:42.613 --> 21:43.613
which is neerakara,

21:43.613 --> 21:45.613
which is formless,

21:48.613 --> 21:50.613
they go to the right side.

21:50.613 --> 21:52.613
There’s formless God,

21:52.613 --> 21:54.613
it’s nice, formless everywhere is God,

21:54.613 --> 21:57.613
in Me, in you, everyone there is God,

21:57.613 --> 21:59.613
everybody’s God.

21:59.613 --> 22:02.613
Even if you are a devil, you are God.

22:03.613 --> 22:05.613
There’s nothing wrong with anyone,

22:05.613 --> 22:07.613
everybody’s God,

22:07.613 --> 22:09.613
starts on that principle.

22:12.613 --> 22:15.613
So they go onto supraconscious side

22:15.613 --> 22:18.613
and they become demonic.

22:21.613 --> 22:23.613
Then they must fight,

22:23.613 --> 22:24.613
because they are devils. Devils have to fight;

22:24.613 --> 22:27.613
otherwise, how will they exist?

22:29.613 --> 22:32.613
They fight, they aggress,

22:32.613 --> 22:34.613
they go to other countries,

22:35.613 --> 22:37.613
aggress them, capture them,

22:37.613 --> 22:40.613
all the time they are thinking of aggressing others.

22:40.613 --> 22:42.613
In a subtler way they aggress,

22:42.613 --> 22:45.613
nowadays the media is aggressive in the West.

22:47.613 --> 22:49.613
There are so many ways of aggression

22:49.613 --> 22:55.613
and to them aggression is something is very dharmic.

22:55.613 --> 22:57.613
For anything.

22:57.613 --> 23:00.613
They’ll ask direct questions,

23:00.613 --> 23:06.613
arrogant, insulting and cruel,

23:08.613 --> 23:09.613
they become cruel.

23:13.613 --> 23:15.613
That’s how the turmoil starts

23:15.613 --> 23:18.613
when we start using the power of Saraswati

23:18.613 --> 23:21.613
in a wrong way or the power of Mahakali.

23:27.613 --> 23:31.613
That’s why in Sahaja Yoga before the Puja

23:31.613 --> 23:33.613
we have to go into lot of activity.

23:33.613 --> 23:35.613
You have to decorate the hall,

23:35.613 --> 23:38.613
you have to get the flowers,

23:38.613 --> 23:41.613
you have to organize everything beautifully.

23:42.613 --> 23:45.613
Look at the roses, how beautiful they are.

23:45.613 --> 23:48.613
Then you starts balancing yourself

23:48.613 --> 23:51.613
with all these activities you do.

23:56.613 --> 23:59.613
And then you sit down for puja.

23:59.613 --> 24:02.613
That’s like in the daytime you work,

24:02.613 --> 24:03.613
in the night you sleep.

24:05.613 --> 24:08.613
To rest, to get the place: you must be active.

24:11.613 --> 24:13.613
Like they have to climb Himalayas

24:13.613 --> 24:16.613
to achieve meditation,

24:17.613 --> 24:19.613
because when you are tired,

24:19.613 --> 24:23.613
you can be restful afterwards.

24:23.613 --> 24:25.613
Otherwise, if you get somebody,

24:25.613 --> 24:27.613
say, from Switzerland only,

24:27.613 --> 24:33.613
the very speedy person for meditation,

24:33.613 --> 24:36.613
you’ll have to put the glue on him

24:37.613 --> 24:40.613
to settle down because he’ll be frantic, you know,

24:40.613 --> 24:44.613
all the time. Will be all the time jumping!

24:49.613 --> 24:56.613
So the activity has to come before the puja

24:58.613 --> 25:00.613
and the balance has to be established.

25:00.613 --> 25:03.613
So the ladies have to find out the saris

25:03.613 --> 25:05.613
and the blouses and this and that

25:05.613 --> 25:07.613
and they have to worry about putting the flowers,

25:07.613 --> 25:10.613
arranging things, this, that. Lot of activities!

25:12.613 --> 25:14.613
We have to travel.

25:14.613 --> 25:17.613
For English it was necessary to travel all the way from England,

25:17.613 --> 25:20.613
to arrange their money and rooms and everything to come here,

25:22.613 --> 25:27.613
to go to futuristic side, to think what they are going to pay,

25:27.613 --> 25:30.613
how they are going to pay back their loans!

25:34.613 --> 25:40.613
All this futuristic: planning they have to do before they come to Switzerland.

25:42.613 --> 25:49.613
Switzerland being the most active place, it’s better to have the puja here, so they are not so much active!

25:51.613 --> 25:54.613
That’s how the Devi arranges everything.

25:57.613 --> 26:01.613
So the ascent starts evolving.

26:03.613 --> 26:10.613
In that, the play of the Devi is the Navaratri – in your ascent – from ages.

26:10.613 --> 26:15.613
Navaratri: that’s why is the most important Puja.

26:16.613 --> 26:21.613
In Sahaja Yoga, Navaratri is the most important puja.

26:21.613 --> 26:28.613
Though we can say in modern Sahaja Yoga Sahastrar Day is, because that’s how you started getting your Realisation.

26:28.613 --> 26:33.613
But if you go to the whole historical events of evolution

26:34.613 --> 26:42.613
you’ll find [that] Navaratri is the one which has brought you to Sahastrara.

26:42.613 --> 26:47.613
Without the help of the Devi at different stages of your ascent,

26:47.613 --> 26:53.613
you could not have been in a position to receive your Realisation.

26:53.613 --> 26:59.613
So all the steps that you took in the past are today worshipped

27:00.613 --> 27:08.613
and are used for thanking the Devi for what She did to bring you down here.

27:08.613 --> 27:09.613
So it’s like a thanksgiving.

27:10.613 --> 27:15.613
Without Her work nothing could have happened.

27:15.613 --> 27:19.613
So, when we read about the Devi, about Her incarnations:

27:19.613 --> 27:23.613
how She came on this Earth to save Her bhaktas,

27:23.613 --> 27:32.613
people who were trying to ascend, to cross this bhavasagara,

27:33.613 --> 27:36.613
how She worked hard,

27:36.613 --> 27:39.613
how she fought the devils,

27:39.613 --> 27:45.613
how She fought, She killed the demons single-handed,

27:46.613 --> 27:52.613
She took upon Herself the responsibility of making the people cross the bhavasagara.

27:53.613 --> 27:58.613
Guru gave you the strength to have dharma, but She is the one who brought you out.

27:58.613 --> 28:02.613
Even those who were dharmic could not do it because of the demonic pressure.

28:03.613 --> 28:09.613
She’s the One who fought single-handed with Her powers of destruction.

28:10.613 --> 28:13.613
In Her love for you She fought.

28:13.613 --> 28:15.613
She brought you to this level.

28:15.613 --> 28:20.613
And then She took a milder form of incarnation.

28:21.613 --> 28:24.613
Even during the time of all the gurus,

28:24.613 --> 28:34.613
She took the form of, as you know, Janaki was the daughter of Janaka,

28:34.613 --> 28:41.613
then Fatima was the daughter of Mohammed Sahib

28:41.613 --> 28:44.613
and Nanaki was the sister of Nanaka.

28:44.613 --> 28:57.613
In those forms, these Powers sustained and nourished the Guru Tattwa.

28:57.613 --> 29:04.613
And later on, or sometimes simultaneously,

29:06.613 --> 29:16.613
They incarnated in milder forms to help human beings to rise.

29:16.613 --> 29:19.613
So, today is the day of thanksgiving.

29:20.613 --> 29:24.613
As Guru Puja is a day of thanksgiving to your Guru,

29:24.613 --> 29:26.613
the One who has counselled you,

29:26.613 --> 29:30.613
the One who has told you about the Truth,

29:30.613 --> 29:37.613
the One who has taught you the Truth and has given you Realisation.

29:38.613 --> 29:43.613
And the Devi puja is a thanksgiving where, single-handed,

29:45.613 --> 29:49.613
just like a very loving mother, under Her sari,

29:49.613 --> 29:58.613
She protected you, fought for you, fought with every enemy that is around,

29:59.613 --> 30:04.613
every sort of problems that existed

30:04.613 --> 30:11.613
and ultimately brought you into Sahastrara level and then gave you Realisation.

30:11.613 --> 30:15.613
It’s a real thanksgiving to the Mother.

30:17.613 --> 30:23.613
So, we can say Navaratri is like a Mother’s Day where you give thanksgiving to Her:

30:23.613 --> 30:30.613
which was just relentless, continuous working for Her children.

30:33.613 --> 30:39.613
Motherhood is much more important than the guruhood.

30:39.613 --> 30:45.613
Because guru is the one who trains you, makes you efficient.

30:45.613 --> 30:48.613
But the Mother forgives you,

30:48.613 --> 30:53.613
She loves you, She sustains you and She teaches you how to love.

30:53.613 --> 30:59.613
She has tremendous patience and tremendous, love and She does it single-handed.

30:59.613 --> 31:03.613
She doesn’t expect anything from you – absolutely selfless.

31:04.613 --> 31:11.613
'Selfless’ is a very small word I should say, it’s such an expansive compassion

31:11.613 --> 31:21.613
which engulfs everything that is wrong, dissolves it, digest it, absorbs it.

31:23.613 --> 31:28.613
So, it’s a very great day Navaratri is, for all the Sahaja Yogis,

31:28.613 --> 31:41.613
because then She took Her form as Sita, as the Power of Shri Rama, silent potential,

31:41.613 --> 31:47.613
suffering. How much She suffered! How much She suffered!

31:49.613 --> 31:52.613
Then She took the form of Radha.

31:53.613 --> 32:01.613
Then She came as five powers of Saraswati as the five wives of Shri Krishna.

32:03.613 --> 32:10.613
Then She came as Mary: that was the greatest suffering, I think, to see the Son being crucified.

32:10.613 --> 32:16.613
The suffering, silent, patient suffering, She had to go through it.

32:17.613 --> 32:20.613
All that drama, to be seen, was too much.

32:20.613 --> 32:26.613
She went through all that because you all had to cross your Agya Chakra.

32:26.613 --> 32:28.613
She had to sacrifice Her Child.

32:28.613 --> 32:32.613
It’s easy for a father to do that, very difficult for a mother.

32:33.613 --> 32:39.613
Now you are all mothers, so many of you, you will know what it is to have a child

32:39.613 --> 32:42.613
and how one feels about it.

32:45.613 --> 32:47.613
After doing that,

32:47.613 --> 32:53.613
She comes to the state where you have to give your Realisation.

32:53.613 --> 32:56.913
Is a work of tremendous patience, as you know.

32:56.913 --> 33:00.613
It’s tremendous patience and understanding.

33:00.613 --> 33:08.613
Human beings, as the time advanced, have evolved no doubt for Realisation,

33:08.613 --> 33:14.613
but also evolved to very funny, stupid, crooked nonsensical ways.

33:14.613 --> 33:20.613
It’s impossible to understand how they go about with their stupid ideas

33:20.613 --> 33:22.613
and how troublesome they can be!

33:22.613 --> 33:27.613
They can be very crooked, funny, troublesome

33:27.613 --> 33:33.613
to such an extent that sometimes even it is difficult to forgive.

33:35.613 --> 33:41.613
Despite that so many of you are here today, in Europe,

33:41.613 --> 33:47.613
in the land of the Guru, here I find, who have got Realisation.

33:47.613 --> 33:54.613
So, the Mother’s pride, Mother’s joy knows no bounds,no doubt about it.

33:54.613 --> 33:57.613
It’s such a great thing to see Her children

33:57.613 --> 34:03.613
sitting here to receive all the powers from Her.

34:04.613 --> 34:08.613
Now, again, when we are in this situation,

34:08.613 --> 34:14.613
we have to know the first principle with which the whole thing started:

34:14.613 --> 34:18.613
that it is the power of love.

34:21.613 --> 34:27.613
It is the power of love that has brought you to this state

34:27.613 --> 34:33.613
and it’s the power of love that you will express and manifest; you will evolve.

34:35.613 --> 34:42.613
Now, after coming to Sahaja Yoga also the temptations become subtler and subtler.

34:42.613 --> 34:50.613
We try to do Sahaj Yog, we try to spread Sahaja Yoga, sometimes for the powers .

34:50.613 --> 34:53.613
Maybe you are lonely, so you want to have more Sahaja Yogis.

34:53.613 --> 34:59.613
Maybe you do it because you think that, that’s how you spread your powers.

34:59.613 --> 35:04.613
Even there are problems on leadership I find, ego problems there are.

35:04.613 --> 35:08.613
Somebody’s appointed a leader then another feels bad, this, that all goes on.

35:08.613 --> 35:13.613
I see the drama going on. Like small children they fight. What is this leadership?

35:13.613 --> 35:17.613
Is just artificial! It’s not even noted in any newspaper!

35:23.613 --> 35:28.613
As they have mock governments we have a mock leadership.

35:30.613 --> 35:34.613
So, then people fight for that – this becomes subtler.

35:34.613 --> 35:37.613
The power struggle goes on becoming subtler and subtler.

35:40.613 --> 35:46.613
Then again money problems come up. Some people think that

35:46.613 --> 35:49.613
Sahaja Yoga is a very big way of making money.

35:49.613 --> 35:53.613
Or some people think that, “We can get lot of money, because

35:53.613 --> 35:58.613
Mother blesses people with money, affluence, so let us be in Sahaja Yoga,”

35:58.613 --> 36:00.613
but don’t spend a single pai, you see,

36:00.613 --> 36:07.613
just manage it. No! It’s not like that. It’s the other way round!

36:10.613 --> 36:13.613
It’s again the another dilemma is there that,

36:13.613 --> 36:23.613
in India which is a place of poverty compare to all of you, everyone donates money.

36:23.613 --> 36:29.613
All the trustees in every centre wherever there are trustees,

36:29.613 --> 36:34.613
have to donate at least five thousand rupees to become the trustees.

36:34.613 --> 36:38.613
Of course, I don’t get anything out of it,

36:38.613 --> 36:42.513
but I must have donated I don’t know how many how much Myself

36:42.513 --> 36:45.613
to become the Trustee of Sahaja Yogis!

36:46.913 --> 36:49.913
But you have to donate.

36:52.913 --> 36:58.913
And when you become miserly again that means, again, it’s the same thing going on.

37:00.913 --> 37:05.913
You have bank balances, but the source is finished and you have nothing left.

37:06.913 --> 37:10.913
The bank balance should be with God.

37:10.913 --> 37:15.913
Then He gives you interest more than the capital.

37:15.913 --> 37:18.913
Is there any bank which does that?

37:21.913 --> 37:25.913
At least not the Swiss Bank!

37:27.913 --> 37:30.913
You have to pay for keeping money with them.

37:34.913 --> 37:43.913
That’s how it is. You should tap . Always try to go to the source.

37:46.913 --> 37:51.913
This becomes subtler and subtler in the sense

37:51.913 --> 37:55.913
that people think that now their children are realized souls.

37:56.913 --> 38:00.913
All right, so what? They are not Gods, are they?

38:00.913 --> 38:05.913
They get so involved with their children, I mean, this is another stupidity women fall into.

38:07.913 --> 38:10.913
But to them their child is so important,

38:10.913 --> 38:12.913
they get so adhered to the child.

38:12.913 --> 38:17.913
I mean, first they used to neglect the children, now they become so attached to their children

38:17.913 --> 38:21.913
that they look like glued people all the time.

38:23.913 --> 38:28.913
And such children cannot grow properly unless and until you give them freedom.

38:29.913 --> 38:32.913
Give them full freedom to grow.

38:32.913 --> 38:41.913
But guidance, of course, that they are majestic people, meaning Sahaja Yogis,

38:41.913 --> 38:46.913
they are born realised as a Sahaja Yogi, as a good Sahaja Yogi how they should behave.

38:46.913 --> 38:51.913
Have a rapport, talk to them, tell them about it, how they be.

38:51.913 --> 38:56.913
Develop that self-respect within them that they should be like this.

38:56.913 --> 38:58.913
Not to glue them to you.

39:02.913 --> 39:06.913
That’s not the way. Children will never grow properly, even physically,

39:06.913 --> 39:08.913
if you glue them to yourself.

39:10.913 --> 39:15.913
In the West now I see new ideas coming up that the children must be glued to the mother.

39:16.913 --> 39:21.913
This is from one extreme to another extreme.They’ll become very left-sided.

39:21.913 --> 39:26.913
Even if they’ll be grown up in age they won’t grow up in their brains.

39:26.913 --> 39:30.913
They won’t grow up in their behaviour if they are glued with the mother.

39:31.913 --> 39:35.913
If they cry for a while, little bit, doesn’t matter,

39:35.913 --> 39:39.913
but the children must be made to sleep away from the mother.

39:39.913 --> 39:44.913
All the time you should not carry your children in your lap. There is no need at all.

39:45.913 --> 39:51.913
But this is not that the child wants, is the mother who wants this kind of a thing.

39:53.913 --> 40:00.913
And some fathers also I have seen glue down to their children

40:01.913 --> 40:08.913
and then they say, “Mother, my child is spoiled, he’s like this, like that.”

40:08.913 --> 40:13.913
Such children will get possessed very fast if you make the children dependant on you.

40:13.913 --> 40:16.913
Very fast they’ll become possessed.

40:16.913 --> 40:20.913
If you make them over-independent, “You are on your own”,

40:20.913 --> 40:23.913
like the other side was that when we were in Oxted

40:23.913 --> 40:28.913
a girl of seven years used to come and give us newspapers.

40:28.913 --> 40:31.913
And she was a daughter of a lord!

40:31.913 --> 40:36.913
At about five o’clock in the morning, in that cold she used to climb up all the way

40:36.913 --> 40:40.913
on a bicycle delivering those newspapers.

40:40.913 --> 40:43.913
And when I told her mother, “What are you doing? It’s very dangerous,

40:43.913 --> 40:46.913
this child is in danger, she is a girl, how can you do that to her?”

40:46.913 --> 40:49.913
she said, “No, no, she has to be on her own.”

40:51.913 --> 40:57.913
So, the one side is to be on her own and another side is to glue them,

40:57.913 --> 41:02.913
is again the same subtle attitude of possessiveness. It’s possessiveness,

41:02.913 --> 41:08.913
"This is my child, I must look after the child, the child is self-realised soul, this, that.”

41:08.913 --> 41:14.913
Only your child is not realised soul, everybody’s child is the realised soul in Sahaja Yoga.

41:14.913 --> 41:17.913
How much do you do for other’s children?

41:17.913 --> 41:20.913
Or only you look after your own child?

41:22.913 --> 41:26.913
The custom should be: if you buy one thing for your child,

41:26.913 --> 41:30.913
buy two more things for another child.

41:30.913 --> 41:35.913
Buy better things for another child and less things for your child.

41:40.913 --> 41:43.913
Let your child share his things with others.

41:44.913 --> 41:48.913
At the time when you are buying something, buy something that he can share.

41:48.913 --> 41:50.913
Teach him how to share.

41:50.913 --> 41:56.913
Because though they are realised souls, with the mothers and the fathers like this

41:56.913 --> 42:01.913
they’ll become again the same miserly old-style people:

42:03.913 --> 42:09.913
quarrelsome, fighting, beating each other, troubling each other.

42:09.913 --> 42:11.913
So be careful .

42:11.913 --> 42:22.913
Being realised-souls, you will be surprised, they will be extremely, extremely convenient for you.

42:22.913 --> 42:25.913
Give them to other Sahaja Yogis to handle, depend on them,

42:25.913 --> 42:27.913
let them look after.

42:27.913 --> 42:34.913
And the homogeneous feeling comes through children. Children are the ones who bind each other.

42:34.913 --> 42:38.913
But, “Don’t touch my child! This is my child!”

42:38.913 --> 42:41.913
you close the door as soon as somebody comes in.

42:42.913 --> 42:46.913
That’s you are going back in the same way as your mothers have been.

42:47.913 --> 42:50.913
There’s no war on in Sahaja Yoga.

42:51.913 --> 42:55.913
We are in the government of God.

42:56.913 --> 42:59.913
This realisation has to come.

42:59.913 --> 43:04.913
There is no need to seek all these useless things, these pleasures of life.

43:05.913 --> 43:10.913
Understand your responsibility

43:10.913 --> 43:16.913
that you are Sahaja Yogis first and last and, in the middle

43:18.913 --> 43:22.913
and as Sahaja Yogis what is your duty?

43:22.913 --> 43:28.913
Is to be completely dedicated for the betterment and the benevolence of others.

43:30.913 --> 43:34.913
That’s the only thing which is going to nourish you to rise.

43:34.913 --> 43:38.913
If you look after your children like this, like mad, it’s not going to help you .

43:38.913 --> 43:40.913
You’ll have problems.

43:40.913 --> 43:43.913
If you neglect your children, you will have problems.

43:46.913 --> 43:53.913
So come in the centre and be just witnesses of all that.

43:57.913 --> 44:03.913
It’s a very common failing in the beginning of every Sahaja Yogi who comes to Sahaja Yoga.

44:03.913 --> 44:09.913
They’ll send me the list of five generations on this side and five generations on this side

44:09.913 --> 44:20.913
"my fathers, brothers, sisters, this thing, that thing, real cousins, real this thing is sick.

44:20.913 --> 44:23.913
So please, Mother, put Your attention.”

44:23.913 --> 44:27.913
And when I put my attention, the attention returns back, I can’t find that.

44:29.913 --> 44:35.913
It starts like that to begin with. Alright, in the beginning I say, “Alright, just now they have entered.”

44:35.913 --> 44:39.913
"But you don’t know", these are tentacles which keep you down,

44:39.913 --> 44:45.913
they do not allow you to rise in the domain of God.

44:45.913 --> 44:51.913
In the domain of God everything that is yours, even your hair,

44:51.913 --> 44:54.913
are looked after by God Almighty.

44:54.913 --> 45:00.913
Every thing! Can you understand that? Can you realise that?

45:00.913 --> 45:11.913
Is all done by billions and billions and billions of powers of Adi Shakti.

45:16.913 --> 45:22.913
What can you do yourself? Nothing! Except for worrying and troubling.

45:22.913 --> 45:31.913
So just if you believe and assume that power today

45:31.913 --> 45:35.913
that you are in the domain of God,

45:36.913 --> 45:40.913
which is active benevolence,

45:40.913 --> 45:45.913
the nature of it is active benevolence

45:46.913 --> 45:48.913
as we say ‘hita’  (हित).

45:53.913 --> 45:57.913
If you are sick, it is for your benevolence.

45:57.913 --> 46:00.913
If you are alright, it is for your benevolence.

46:00.913 --> 46:06.913
If you have money, it is for your benevolence. If you don’t have money, it is for your benevolence.

46:10.913 --> 46:15.913
Everything does good for you in the domain of God.

46:15.913 --> 46:22.913
Do not judge it according to your own standards.

46:22.913 --> 46:29.913
Whom do you think to be a person who is benevolent in this world apart from Me?

46:31.913 --> 46:33.913
Really, in the real sense of the word?

46:34.913 --> 46:38.913
Supposing you take a man who is very rich;

46:38.913 --> 46:40.913
is he benevolent?

46:41.913 --> 46:47.913
No. Is he happy? No. Is he respected? No.

46:51.913 --> 46:57.913
At least he has to be a realised soul to be somewhere near that description.

46:59.913 --> 47:03.913
And if you have to ascend in the domain of God,

47:03.913 --> 47:07.913
you have to know that everything works through His power:

47:07.913 --> 47:16.913
your activity, your inactivity, your sleep, everything is worked through His powers of love.

47:16.913 --> 47:21.913
Love can never harm, can never destroy.

47:21.913 --> 47:24.913
You go a little ahead with it

47:27.913 --> 47:33.913
and it showers flowers upon you.

47:35.913 --> 47:42.913
But understand your nature: supposing you are a left-sided person.

47:42.913 --> 47:46.913
Mostly I’ve seen left sided persons always want to do my pujas.

47:46.913 --> 47:51.913
And the right-sided person are organising. Do the other way round.

47:51.913 --> 47:59.913
must know your nature, give yourself a balance, and then enter into the Kingdom of God.

47:59.913 --> 48:04.913
Like you entering into a door, say for example,

48:04.913 --> 48:07.913
and you have too much load on your back,

48:07.913 --> 48:09.913
meaning you are a left-sided person.

48:09.913 --> 48:16.913
Then take down the load from your back on your head and enter in.

48:16.913 --> 48:23.913
But if you have too much on your head, put it on your back and enter in.

48:23.913 --> 48:26.913
Because you’re tired. You do it every day.

48:26.913 --> 48:30.913
Supposing this hand is tired, you put it on the left hand.

48:30.913 --> 48:35.913
I see in aeroplane when people are walking, they are holding it in one hand

48:35.913 --> 48:39.913
and automatically when it is tired, they put it to the left – automatically.

48:39.913 --> 48:41.913
They are not Sahaja Yogis!

48:42.913 --> 48:48.913
In the same way in life also, if you have done one-sidedness too much,

48:48.913 --> 48:53.913
try to do the other side and give yourself a balance.

48:55.913 --> 49:00.913
Navaratri is the day to give you the balance.

49:01.913 --> 49:08.913
Those whose right hand is tired will get the power in the left hand.

49:08.913 --> 49:17.913
Those who have the left hand tired will get the power on the right hand to share the load.

49:18.913 --> 49:26.913
So those who are having money problems will solve their money problems.

49:27.913 --> 49:33.913
And those who have sleeping problems will solve their sleeping problems.

49:33.913 --> 49:38.913
But one can say if somebody has both, then what do they do?

49:38.913 --> 49:44.913
I know of somebody, I lived there, in that country

49:44.913 --> 49:49.913
where they have both the problems, they sleep as well as they have no money, and they are not bothered!

50:04.913 --> 50:07.913
So, for such people what should we do?

50:07.913 --> 50:12.913
Of course, I won’t tell you, but one has to do something about it!

50:19.913 --> 50:22.913
One has to work out something.

50:25.913 --> 50:27.913
They just don’t move

50:27.913 --> 50:33.913
and if you tell them, answer is, “I know. I know I sleep a lot;

50:33.913 --> 50:37.913
I know I’m like this. I know. I know.”

50:37.913 --> 50:40.913
That’s all. Then what do you say?

50:40.913 --> 50:46.913
It stops you completely. You can’t go further. If they know, what more to be told?

50:50.913 --> 51:00.913
This is a complete mountain there standing just to finish you completely.

51:09.913 --> 51:12.913
So, one has to do.

51:14.913 --> 51:16.913
Everyone has to do something.

51:16.913 --> 51:18.913
Somebody is working it out,

51:18.913 --> 51:22.713
somebody is doing some work,

51:22.713 --> 51:24.713
and another is not helping.

51:24.713 --> 51:31.713
Then that cannot be completed, it’s a collective work, you cannot! One person cannot do it.

51:32.713 --> 51:37.713
I’ve seen it happens like this. It’s a collective work.

51:37.713 --> 51:43.713
So, we come to the position that Navaratri today is not the work of Mother only,

51:43.713 --> 51:47.713
which She did so far, is the work of every one of you.

51:48.713 --> 51:50.713
I cannot do it single-handed.

51:52.713 --> 51:55.713
If I could, there was no need for you to be here,

51:55.713 --> 52:00.713
I would have built the aeroplane, put you there, pushed them some or other, lock it up and put you there.

52:00.713 --> 52:02.713
It’s not possible.

52:03.713 --> 52:06.713
You all have to carry your own aeroplanes.

52:06.713 --> 52:10.713
Build it up and carry it yourself with dignity,

52:10.713 --> 52:13.713
not like small children. So, you have to mature.

52:14.713 --> 52:19.713
And for that maturity it’s a collective thing that has to take place.

52:19.713 --> 52:23.713
In the beginning in the school, alright, they’ll teach you two plus two is equal to four.

52:23.713 --> 52:27.713
But when you go to the college, you have to do it yourself,

52:28.713 --> 52:31.713
solve the problem yourself.

52:31.713 --> 52:39.713
And that’s what it is today. Sahaja Yoga is good, you get your Realisation in these modern times,

52:39.713 --> 52:43.713
but the maturity has to take place,

52:43.713 --> 52:45.713
otherwise useless.

52:45.713 --> 52:53.713
Up to the seed it was alright, but once it is sprouted it must become the tree, otherwise it’s useless.

52:54.713 --> 52:57.713
And that all of you have to do together,

52:57.713 --> 53:00.713
helping each other, understanding each other.

53:00.713 --> 53:04.713
And everyone has to work it out.

53:04.713 --> 53:07.713
Even if one person suffers, I suffer.

53:12.713 --> 53:16.713
The whole thing has become collective.

53:18.713 --> 53:21.713
The Devi has become collective.

53:23.713 --> 53:26.713
It’s a venture.

53:28.713 --> 53:33.713
It’s a venture, I know, too much of it. There was no other way out.

53:33.713 --> 53:41.713
It’s like crucifixion of every part of Your body, every cell of Your body.

53:44.713 --> 53:46.713
But it’s alright.

53:49.713 --> 53:53.713
So today, instead of feeling guilty,

53:53.713 --> 53:59.713
you should be filled with tremendous courage and tremendous enthusiasm:

53:59.713 --> 54:04.713
that we have to do it, because Mother has given us the power.

54:04.713 --> 54:07.713
We can do it; nothing should keep us down.

54:08.713 --> 54:10.713
And we are going to help each other.

54:10.713 --> 54:16.713
One person is doing one job, nobody will look at it, you see, they won’t just move!

54:16.713 --> 54:21.713
"I know, I’m sitting down, I know. I don’t do anything I know.”

54:25.713 --> 54:28.713
And in Sahaja Yoga, it has become even subtler,

54:28.713 --> 54:32.713
"I want to do but there’s a bhoot in me which doesn’t allow me to do it.”

54:34.713 --> 54:36.713
So, you get out with your bhoot!

54:37.713 --> 54:39.713
That’s what it is.

54:41.713 --> 54:51.713
All these arguments are stupid, of no value in Sahaja Yoga.

54:51.713 --> 54:55.713
That means you have not understood the meaning of Sahaja Yoga,

54:55.713 --> 55:01.713
you have not understood the meaning of yourself, and you have no respect for your life.

55:01.713 --> 55:02.713
That’s what it is.

55:02.713 --> 55:06.713
If you indulge into such thinking, then it is no good.

55:06.713 --> 55:11.713
But today you have to promise to yourself and to me within your heart

55:12.713 --> 55:17.713
that you are going to be filled with that enthusiasm and that shakti.

55:19.713 --> 55:22.713
The time has come.

55:28.713 --> 55:33.713
Which is going to make you real yogis.

55:36.713 --> 55:38.713
Complete dedication.

55:38.713 --> 55:44.713
Imagine these PLO people what they are doing, fearlessly.

55:44.713 --> 55:46.713
I mean, all kinds of people you see around you

55:46.713 --> 55:49.713
even in Kali Yuga are so dedicated to something nonsensical.

55:49.713 --> 55:53.713
Why can’t we be dedicated to something so sensible?

55:57.713 --> 56:00.713
They are not afraid of anything,

56:00.713 --> 56:03.713
they are dare devils.

56:03.713 --> 56:05.713
Why can’t we become like that?

56:06.713 --> 56:09.713
What’s wrong with us?

56:10.713 --> 56:17.713
So every one of us must have that enthusiasm and “I’m an institution by myself.

56:17.713 --> 56:22.713
And I’m going to do it, I’m not going to take advantage of the ashram life,

56:22.713 --> 56:26.713
nicely settled down in the ashram. You see very good, cheap.”

56:26.713 --> 56:30.713
No! We are all going to move out also

56:30.713 --> 56:33.713
and take up a place somewhere else.

56:33.713 --> 56:35.713
For the time being ashram is alright.

56:35.713 --> 56:38.713
But then give more room to others who are coming.

56:38.713 --> 56:42.713
You get out of it. Go out and stay somewhere and work it out.

56:44.713 --> 56:48.713
Then in the ashram, “This is my house, I have spent money for this,

56:48.713 --> 56:52.713
this is my furniture, this is this thing, that thing.”

56:55.713 --> 57:03.713
Actually, you should know how to live on a string, shoestring, as they say, on a shoestring.

57:03.713 --> 57:09.713
Of course, now I’m feeling that every ashram has such a lot of furniture that they had to [UNCLEAR bring].

57:10.713 --> 57:13.713
Better live on a shoestring.

57:13.713 --> 57:19.713
So the tapasya starts.

57:19.713 --> 57:22.713
Go into a penance yourself.

57:22.713 --> 57:27.713
But then I will hear, “Mother, I’m on a tapasya, I’m eating only once.”

57:27.713 --> 57:32.713
Why? Who ask you to be on tapasya? Enjoy! Enjoy your tapasya!

57:32.713 --> 57:35.713
Then it is Sahaja, otherwise: nonsense.

57:35.713 --> 57:39.713
Enjoy. If you can enjoy your tapasya then you are sahaj;

57:39.713 --> 57:43.713
With enthusiasm. Look at these PLOs,

57:44.713 --> 57:47.713
look at these people,

57:49.713 --> 57:55.713
do they say, "We are going in a tapasya”? Nothing.

57:56.713 --> 57:59.713
You have examples of people around you.

58:00.713 --> 58:03.713
But we can’t say  they are possessed by bhoots.

58:03.713 --> 58:09.713
Or even if they are what about you? You better get possessed by sahaj bhoots for a change!

58:11.713 --> 58:15.713
If that’s the way, only, you can be motivated.

58:21.713 --> 58:27.713
So, tell your mind, “No explanations, nothing doing. I am going to show my worth!”

58:35.713 --> 58:40.713
But all the time if the attention is just to show off

58:40.713 --> 58:44.713
or to be in my attention

58:45.713 --> 58:52.713
or to be in contact with me, to be writing to me or something, is not going to help at all.

58:57.713 --> 59:03.713
I am just a mirror, and you see within myself yourself, in the true way.

59:03.713 --> 59:09.713
And also, this mirror, is full of maya.

59:09.713 --> 59:19.713
So, a devil may look into this mirror and may look like a saint to him.

59:19.713 --> 59:23.713
If he has ego, he might look like a saint to himself.

59:25.713 --> 59:36.713
Or if he is a left-sided person he might think he is the incarnation of Bhairava – he might.

59:40.713 --> 59:50.713
But if he is truthful, he can see clearly that he is the highest of highest, he's a sahaja yogi

59:50.713 --> 59:56.713
And unless and until you see yourself like that, know that it’s a maya.

01:00:01.713 --> 01:00:08.713
So, to realise that you have achieved a lot by getting your Realisation,

01:00:08.713 --> 01:00:12.713
of rising so much higher above all these petty ideas.

01:00:12.713 --> 01:00:17.713
Every idea is petty, whether it is economics, politics, philosophy,

01:00:17.713 --> 01:00:21.713
any ism, anything is all petty for a Sahaja Yogi,

01:00:24.713 --> 01:00:30.713
because none of them know even this much about God’s domain.

01:00:30.713 --> 01:00:33.713
What are they talking about is economics!

01:00:37.713 --> 01:00:40.713
They do not know anything about His politics.

01:00:42.713 --> 01:00:47.713
They do not know anything that there is a miraculous power

01:00:47.713 --> 01:00:50.713
which rules the whole Universe,

01:00:51.713 --> 01:00:56.713
and which is so efficient. Which never fails.

01:00:57.713 --> 01:01:03.713
So timely, so sensible, so interesting, dramatic.

01:01:03.713 --> 01:01:08.713
See how we reserved all these things in no time.

01:01:08.713 --> 01:01:13.713
How we got to this place. I was to have this puja here.

01:01:13.713 --> 01:01:16.713
All this you know. How I came here.

01:01:16.713 --> 01:01:21.713
See the miracle working. How the powers of the Divine are working.

01:01:21.713 --> 01:01:23.713
You be the proper instrument of the Divine.

01:01:23.713 --> 01:01:26.713
And it has another force as I told you

01:01:26.713 --> 01:01:30.713
centripetal and centrifugal – and you might be thrown out.

01:01:32.713 --> 01:01:38.713
So be careful on that point. Face yourself in truthfulness!

01:01:38.713 --> 01:01:42.713
Do not get pampered by your ego or morosed  by your superego!

01:01:42.713 --> 01:01:47.713
Just see for yourself as a powerful instrument of love.

01:01:47.713 --> 01:01:50.713
But in love you do not become indiscrete.

01:01:52.713 --> 01:02:00.713
Steadily, beautifully, gently you attend to it.

01:02:02.713 --> 01:02:08.713
And so much power can be born.

01:02:08.713 --> 01:02:13.713
You will be amazed that water, which looks something so frivolous to us,

01:02:13.713 --> 01:02:16.713
has so much power in it.

01:02:17.713 --> 01:02:19.713
You know about hydrostatics.

01:02:22.713 --> 01:02:26.713
This Mother Earth which looks so simple:

01:02:26.713 --> 01:02:31.713
We walk on Her on our feet. She attracts us on ourself.

01:02:31.713 --> 01:02:34.713
She’s spinning with such a speed Herself,

01:02:34.713 --> 01:02:36.713
She keeps us sticking on to Her.

01:02:37.713 --> 01:02:42.713
She’s doing thousands and thousands of tremendous jobs,

01:02:42.713 --> 01:02:46.713
this great Mother Earth She looks so simple.

01:02:46.713 --> 01:02:54.713
She’s so powerful. In the same way you are made out of this Ganesha Tattwa which is so tremendous.

01:02:58.713 --> 01:03:02.713
This Navaratri should give you that power,

01:03:02.913 --> 01:03:08.713
those nine powers of nine chakras.

01:03:08.713 --> 01:03:13.713
Seven chakras: you already know.

01:03:13.713 --> 01:03:18.713
Above that you become the master yourself,

01:03:19.713 --> 01:03:24.713
and then you become the Power yourself.

01:03:32.713 --> 01:03:34.713
May God bless you!
