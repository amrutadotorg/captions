WEBVTT

03:24.308 --> 03:43.125
So we are all here now (UNCLEAR) in this sacred
place called Kolhapur.

03:43.150 --> 03:57.457
The Goddess killed the asura called Kolhasura
here, who was a very bad demon, who was born

03:57.482 --> 04:02.711
again recently, but he died also.

04:02.736 --> 04:07.838
So thank God the death of Kolhasura has taken
place.

04:07.838 --> 04:30.961
This place specially is marked because from
the Mother Earth the Mahalakshmi energy was

04:30.986 --> 04:35.136
emitted specially from the deity of Mahalakshmi.

04:37.764 --> 04:46.531
And as you know that Mahalakshmi is the ascending
power within us.

04:46.556 --> 04:49.388
Through which we ascend.

04:49.491 --> 05:00.384
It’s like the staircase which takes you
into the realm of God and so it is very important.

05:00.670 --> 05:10.359
And Maharastra’s deity is Vittala, Shri
Krishna, because it is the ascending power

05:10.359 --> 05:23.049
of Vishnu through Shri Krishna, then Mahavishnu
and then through Sahastrar.

05:23.049 --> 05:29.539
All this is possible because we have got Mahalakshmi
channel within us.

05:29.539 --> 05:39.859
If you did not have shushumna we would have
been like animals only.

05:39.859 --> 05:48.299
Even animals have this channel up to a point.

05:48.371 --> 05:58.288
As you know they come up to the Void, but
after the Void the ascent as human being starts

05:58.313 --> 06:02.807
through this Mahalakshmi energy within us.

06:03.115 --> 06:15.224
So this energy is very important and that
one is very much worshipped in this country.

06:15.258 --> 06:25.933
First this energy starts working within us
as seeking.

06:25.933 --> 06:32.741
Seeking shelter and food.

06:33.281 --> 06:42.754
Once the shelter is established, which is
established through the Mahakali shakti, I

06:42.778 --> 06:51.268
mean when it is in the heart of an animal
a sense of security is established.

06:51.379 --> 06:54.867
Then he starts seeking food.

06:54.867 --> 07:06.527
In the same way human beings also, once he
is established in his security, then he starts

07:06.527 --> 07:11.516
thinking of feeding himself, looking after
himself.

07:11.516 --> 07:19.837
So at the very primitive state the human beings
first tried to establish their security by

07:19.837 --> 07:28.877
getting into some caves or some shelters where
they could abide without fear to life, because

07:28.877 --> 07:32.907
if there is no life you don’t think of food.

07:32.907 --> 07:37.826
For example if there is an emergency, we had
a very bad floods in Patna and it was such

07:37.826 --> 07:50.296
a bad flood that people had to go in the upper
storey and look after their security, that

07:50.321 --> 07:52.020
was the first thing.

07:52.989 --> 08:03.396
Which is such an innate feeling in human beings
to preserve life and that comes from the Mahakali’s

08:03.396 --> 08:05.020
powers.

08:05.045 --> 08:10.469
And when they went up there, they told me
that they didn’t have food for three days

08:10.494 --> 08:12.414
but they had never thought of food.

08:12.590 --> 08:17.101
They never even thought they were hungry,
they were only worried that the water will

08:17.126 --> 08:20.817
rise up to that point where they are and they’ll
all sink and die.

08:20.817 --> 08:25.176
So the only worry was that how to exist, how
to survive.

08:25.176 --> 08:27.367
I mean the food question did not come.

08:27.367 --> 08:35.447
But when people starve they also start thinking
of insecurity that they may die and they start

08:35.447 --> 08:38.467
thinking about food.

08:38.467 --> 08:46.786
So the first security comes in, then the second
comes: the sense of food.

08:46.786 --> 08:53.727
In emergency the sense of food that comes
is the beginning, but later on we start putting

08:53.727 --> 08:55.895
our attention to food.

08:56.046 --> 08:59.687
Then the enjoyment of the food.

08:59.687 --> 09:04.327
Then discrimination of the food and all those
things you see various things they start coming

09:04.327 --> 09:09.142
into us and we get lost with this Mahalakshmi
tattwa.

09:09.167 --> 09:18.307
The more we worry about the food, the more
we worry about the taste of the food, the

09:18.307 --> 09:24.477
more we worry about the time of the food,
I mean one can live without food for two three

09:24.477 --> 09:27.453
days very easily, there’s no problem.

09:27.478 --> 09:30.563
But we think that we are used to breakfast
at eight o’clock, we must have breakfast

09:30.588 --> 09:32.126
at eight o’clock.

09:32.890 --> 09:38.045
Like Indians are used to their lunch at ten
o’clock, they must have lunch at ten o’clock.

09:38.070 --> 09:44.807
This is all our slavery to time, and that’s
how our seeking which is higher, finishes

09:44.807 --> 09:45.807
off.

09:45.807 --> 09:49.020
Then they’ll start talking about food all
the time.

09:49.045 --> 09:54.707
This is of course Mahakshmi’s blessings
that you think of food, but she doesn’t

09:54.707 --> 09:57.027
say you get lost in it.

09:57.027 --> 10:01.355
So we get lost with it and once we are lost
with it, then our seeking doesn’t become

10:01.380 --> 10:02.979
higher.

10:08.173 --> 10:16.117
Our taste habits; we like this, we like that,
this is good, that is bad, we’d like to

10:16.117 --> 10:21.422
have this; still if it lingers it keeps us
down.

10:21.447 --> 10:24.461
Whatever we get we should try to eat.

10:24.486 --> 10:33.291
Whatever we think good, may not be good for
us.

10:33.316 --> 10:37.581
It may be good for the tongue, but may not
be good for us, may not be good from vibrations

10:37.606 --> 10:38.735
point of view.

10:38.760 --> 10:43.200
So whatever God gives us, whatever is there,
is good.

10:43.225 --> 10:45.706
Vibrate it and eat it.

10:46.210 --> 10:52.739
Also then the preservation sense comes in
that if you eat wrong type of food, then people

10:52.906 --> 10:58.567
start thinking, that this will also ruin their
security, because they may lose their health.

10:58.567 --> 11:04.977
Then they start thinking about, up to a point
is all right, but if you do too much, then

11:04.977 --> 11:07.627
you get out of the circulation.

11:07.627 --> 11:12.461
In the sense that if you are flying through…

11:12.486 --> 11:16.149
Will you please pay attention here, I’m
surprised that you are

11:16.302 --> 11:19.846
sahaja yogis, how is it your attention goes
to small things like that?

11:26.359 --> 11:29.753
There’s some ladies still looking at that
side.

11:32.851 --> 11:37.444
(UNCLEAR) Please try to put your attention
to what I’m saying.

11:39.913 --> 11:43.326
Is it important that brother bringing something,
must you see that?

11:44.525 --> 11:48.067
I mean this is really silly at this age.

11:48.092 --> 11:56.032
Now you are sahaja yogis, your attention should
be concentrated.

12:01.542 --> 12:12.067
So now the attention more goes towards the
acquisition of better facilities for food

12:12.067 --> 12:17.157
or better food, whatever you may call for
‘health food’ as you call it and that

12:17.157 --> 12:24.133
also if you go too much, you can touch the
banks, but you shouldn’t cross over and

12:24.158 --> 12:28.326
walk through, otherwise how will you move
on the river, that’s the point is.

12:28.326 --> 12:32.047
So we start building up that sort of a nonsense
also; this is good for health, this is not

12:32.047 --> 12:35.633
good for health, that is good for health…and
health for what?

12:36.046 --> 12:38.133
For what is the health?

12:38.490 --> 12:43.504
Health is for having a good attention, which
you don’t have, is lost in the food.

12:43.529 --> 12:49.446
And some people I’ve seen, they are just
still lost in food, completely.

12:49.446 --> 12:57.799
Though they have got a glimpse of sahaja yoga,
but still they are very much attached to food.

12:57.824 --> 13:06.216
So that sort of an attitude must be changed,
we should see where we go and get ourselves

13:06.216 --> 13:09.956
attached and lose our attention.

13:09.956 --> 13:16.437
This is very important that we should be very
careful about our attention, where is it?

13:16.437 --> 13:21.346
So now the attention moves on with that, I
mean those who still move further and don’t

13:21.346 --> 13:26.797
jump on the banks, still move in the river,
further on.

13:26.797 --> 13:32.517
Attention goes on, then they think that you
see this kind, it works all the time the insecurity

13:32.517 --> 13:33.786
part of it in it.

13:33.786 --> 13:40.156
So that this food will be lost, so what should
we do to have better food.

13:40.156 --> 13:43.766
So they start thinking of money.

13:43.766 --> 13:47.757
So you know that the barter system became
a system of money.

13:47.757 --> 13:49.956
People started having money.

13:49.956 --> 13:57.797
But then apart from food, clothing, other
things started and people started moving with

13:57.797 --> 14:01.617
it to the Mahakali power more and more.

14:01.617 --> 14:04.843
And the creative power more and more.

14:04.868 --> 14:09.066
The banks are also becoming subtler and subtler,
the movement is also becoming subtler and

14:09.091 --> 14:10.091
subtler.

14:10.204 --> 14:18.627
So as the man started moving higher and higher,
arts developed on the right side and the idea

14:18.627 --> 14:22.761
of quality of life or quality of security
changed.

14:22.848 --> 14:30.937
So the both the sides becoming subtler and
subtler and the growth becoming subtler and

14:30.937 --> 14:36.785
subtler, man gets again lost into those subtler
banks, on the right and the left.

14:36.817 --> 14:39.194
Still you have to move further.

14:39.219 --> 14:42.436
So the Mahalakshmi power takes you higher
and higher.

14:42.461 --> 14:46.456
That time then you think you must express
yourself.

14:46.456 --> 14:49.877
And the expression starts in arts, culture.

14:49.877 --> 14:58.786
It starts also in your living, in your institutions
of security, like political advancement, political

14:58.786 --> 15:06.716
institutions and that’s how human being
reached a point where now they think they

15:06.716 --> 15:15.632
have done that was all possible, but still
in a subtler way they are still lost.

15:15.657 --> 15:23.222
So the Mahalakshmi tattwa went up to say Christ,
up to that point and still people have not

15:23.247 --> 15:26.404
gone into the subtler side of that.

15:26.713 --> 15:35.177
They are still on the banks, moving towards
the banks, not in the centre of it.

15:35.177 --> 15:46.107
In sahaja yoga, what happens is that the pure
desire, that is kundalini is kept at the beginning

15:46.132 --> 15:51.177
of the life, just at the beginning of the
life.

15:51.202 --> 15:55.607
When you were not even a human being.

15:55.607 --> 16:08.297
Even below is carbon and all the journey from
carbon onwards is to be recrossed again through

16:08.297 --> 16:11.539
the kundalini.

16:11.697 --> 16:22.477
All this journey that you did on the superficial
level of this Mahalakshmi stream has to be

16:22.477 --> 16:34.247
redone in the innermost way, to penetrate
through all these subtler centres, which are

16:34.247 --> 16:38.121
inside the stream, not outside.

16:38.232 --> 16:42.407
Because if you are on the outside, you always
go to the banks.

16:42.432 --> 16:47.356
From where you cannot see any banks, there
is no attention that could be taken to the

16:47.381 --> 16:50.787
banks, but you move further.

16:50.812 --> 16:53.642
Like a jet.

16:53.780 --> 17:04.708
And this kundalini is the one that’s the
true desire, but your attention has to be

17:04.733 --> 17:06.486
on the target.

17:06.511 --> 17:13.747
Even if you say that the kundalini is the
moving force, still where is your attention?

17:13.747 --> 17:19.917
Still your attention is on the banks, so you
come up again superficially, you come and

17:19.917 --> 17:24.607
just float superficially and then again jump
onto some bank and then again I’ll have

17:24.607 --> 17:28.091
to put you down inside the water: ‘Go inside,
inside.

17:28.116 --> 17:31.679
’ Again go back to the kundalini, again
start your journey.

17:31.981 --> 17:42.197
But from the very beginning steadfast if you
move towards the target, towards the spirit,

17:42.197 --> 17:43.916
then I have no problem.

17:43.916 --> 17:49.257
But it doesn’t happen with human beings,
they are so much used to the attraction of

17:49.257 --> 17:56.397
the banks that they always come up, float,
go to the banks and again sometimes settle

17:56.397 --> 17:58.416
down there or again come back.

17:58.416 --> 18:03.036
So the journey is upward, downward, downward,
upward.

18:03.036 --> 18:05.608
Though the movement of the kundalini could

18:05.633 --> 18:08.878
be such that you jump like a jet and set down there.

18:09.405 --> 18:14.207
The day that starts I’ll be the happiest
person because it is too much sometimes for

18:14.207 --> 18:22.867
me, to make this kind of a journey four times
up and down with everyone, because of the

18:22.867 --> 18:25.967
so called attachments they have outside.

18:25.967 --> 18:33.827
The inner movement with a detached mind, if
they accept the situation and they decide

18:33.827 --> 18:36.103
within themselves that I’m going to do like
this,

18:36.128 --> 18:38.825
I’ve decided on this, they can work it out.

18:38.850 --> 18:40.109
But it’s not so.

18:40.447 --> 18:45.528
Mostly the attitude should be that Mother
is like a mirror.

18:45.886 --> 18:49.825
And we have a mirror in front of us, so we
know how we are proceeding.

18:49.928 --> 18:54.832
So in the mirror if I see myself like this,
better get rid of it and go on.

18:54.935 --> 18:59.991
But on the contrary if Mother says something
to someone, that this is so,

19:00.015 --> 19:03.329
then they feel hurt and again float up.

19:03.383 --> 19:05.393
The mirror has to say something.

19:05.418 --> 19:09.809
Supposing you have some spot on your face,
the mirror is not going to please you, it

19:09.809 --> 19:11.375
will say it is there.

19:11.400 --> 19:15.948
So you don’t hit the mirror and you just
don’t get angry with the mirror, do you?

19:15.973 --> 19:20.041
You see that you clear yourself because you
don’t want to have any spots.

19:20.066 --> 19:21.951
But just the other way round.

19:21.976 --> 19:26.472
What happens with people I have seen, that
if you tell them anything or you just tell

19:26.497 --> 19:32.742
them this is wrong, they’ll first explain,
argue, this thing and if it doesn’t work

19:32.767 --> 19:36.309
out then they will just get angry with sahaja
yoga and you.

19:36.309 --> 19:41.493
As if they are obliging sahaja yoga, as if
they are obliging Mother.

19:41.518 --> 19:44.438
Actually you are obliging yourself.

19:45.789 --> 19:51.417
You are not obliging anyone or if you take
up that kind of an attitude, then only you

19:51.442 --> 19:56.720
will realize that you have to move forward
without looking left or right.

19:56.752 --> 20:02.423
So we have had many experiences, quite funny
if you look back you can see that you have

20:02.543 --> 20:09.293
been sometimes Romeo Juliets, sometimes you
have been money minded people, sometimes you

20:09.318 --> 20:12.560
have been quarrelling, fighting, arguing type.

20:12.585 --> 20:14.447
All kinds we have had.

20:14.472 --> 20:22.887
But those who forget all this and shoot off
towards the goal

20:22.912 --> 20:25.975
are the best and the most   sensible.

20:26.303 --> 20:30.817
They are the most selfish people, because
they know what selfishness is, all the rest

20:30.842 --> 20:34.133
are stupid because they are losing their time.

20:34.158 --> 20:39.718
There are some people I’ve seen who also
try to use sahaja yoga for making money or

20:39.743 --> 20:44.681
making something for sahaj yog sort of thing

20:44.706 --> 20:47.769
and making some money out of it or sort of a thing.

20:47.794 --> 20:57.058
You better make yourself is the best way and
enjoy it in a way that makes you happy and

20:57.083 --> 21:00.890
makes others happy in the sahaja stream.

21:00.915 --> 21:06.542
But getting out of the sahaja stream and doing
something is again coming out of that innermost

21:06.542 --> 21:13.665
channel of Bramha nadi, outward, again floating,
going to the banks, again going down, because

21:13.690 --> 21:18.315
every time you go down like that you have
to start your kundalini again back.

21:18.830 --> 21:20.776
It’s a very difficult thing.

21:20.808 --> 21:24.337
And the force of the kundalini gets spent.

21:24.392 --> 21:29.472
So one has to understand that if you have
to do this journey,

21:29.497 --> 21:32.337
you have to be a determined person.

21:32.362 --> 21:35.231
You have to be a disciplined person, yourself.

21:35.256 --> 21:39.026
Nobody should tell you that discipline yourself,
do this do that.

21:39.051 --> 21:39.971
You have to do it.

21:39.996 --> 21:44.517
What others are doing, first is the attention
is there, I mean if somebody brings it here,

21:44.563 --> 21:46.088
everybody’s attention must go there.

21:46.113 --> 21:48.063
What is there to see?

21:51.798 --> 21:57.631
But this is nothing, this is very, very superfluous
thing, but even serious things should not

21:57.656 --> 21:59.513
attract your attention.

21:59.538 --> 22:06.907
Your attention should be on the solution of
all the solutions.

22:06.932 --> 22:14.767
Blessing of all the blessings.

22:14.799 --> 22:18.259
The emancipation of all the emancipations.

22:19.466 --> 22:25.003
You shouldn’t worry about anything else,
you just worry about that connection, which

22:25.028 --> 22:27.516
is being established and nothing else.

22:27.541 --> 22:29.873
Everything is looked after.

22:30.414 --> 22:33.296
It is as simple as that.

22:33.395 --> 22:38.181
If this connection is broken the simple thing
is to keep the connection on.

22:38.269 --> 22:41.350
What’s the use of polishing this, doing
this, doing that?

22:41.375 --> 22:44.675
Are you going to get the connection back?

22:44.700 --> 22:51.150
This is a simple, practical thing we find.

22:52.137 --> 22:59.979
And once we start forgetting that practical
side, we become retarded in our progress.

23:00.082 --> 23:03.289
And what we find, wherever we are, we are
there.

23:03.322 --> 23:07.020
Like in this Kolapur I would say, when I come
you’ll see tonight, there will be a huge

23:07.045 --> 23:09.332
crowd, very huge crowd.

23:09.332 --> 23:10.704
Always we have.

23:11.617 --> 23:15.086
Out of them how many really take up this journey?

23:15.111 --> 23:16.111
Very few.

23:18.941 --> 23:19.941
Doesn’t matter.

23:19.941 --> 23:21.277
You shouldn’t mind it.

23:21.302 --> 23:23.802
Because they are not wise yet.

23:23.993 --> 23:30.031
But those who become wise, who take up the
journey, also in between ‘jack in the box’

23:30.062 --> 23:31.322
they come out.

23:32.084 --> 23:34.635
Suddenly I find somebody floating.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.833
We are going through the submarine.

23:36.858 --> 23:39.606
And they just jet out.

23:40.567 --> 23:43.578
This is how it has happened with all our journey.

23:43.603 --> 23:52.305
And at this place when we are, we have arrived
here not by plane, not by car, not by roads,

23:52.704 --> 23:58.992
but through the innermost core of our heart,
you have arrived, the bramha nadi.

23:59.017 --> 24:06.065
We have arrived at Kolapur at Mahalakshmi’s
point, through the most innermost part and

24:06.090 --> 24:08.618
that’s how we are here.

24:08.643 --> 24:12.869
So we look at this place in a very gross manner.

24:12.894 --> 24:16.898
That’s our old habits.

24:16.923 --> 24:21.635
But the new habit should be vibration wise,
where are we?

24:21.660 --> 24:22.737
What is it?

24:22.762 --> 24:29.542
Once you develop this, we I can definitely
completely transform this Kolapur in (UNCLEAR)

24:29.567 --> 24:32.389
You are like my channels.

24:32.414 --> 24:37.641
When you go with me, I use you as my channels.

24:37.666 --> 24:42.479
But what I find is that the channels are sometimes
crooked, sometimes broken, sometimes there

24:42.504 --> 24:46.015
are holes and the energy is wasted.

24:46.015 --> 24:50.265
So it is the duty of all the sahaja yogis
who are travelling with me specially, is to

24:50.265 --> 24:53.235
be the channels.

24:53.235 --> 24:59.205
But if you take an attitude that you are here
as guests, you have to be looked after, the

24:59.205 --> 25:05.223
arrangement should be good, that should be
good, then you have, there is no meaning.

25:05.248 --> 25:06.778
You are travelling.

25:08.396 --> 25:11.296
You are travelling like saints who travel
with Buddha.

25:11.321 --> 25:13.849
Even much more, because they did not do anything.

25:13.874 --> 25:15.596
But you are the channels.

25:15.644 --> 25:21.030
As you are the channels, you have to keep
your channels open, efficient and you should

25:21.055 --> 25:23.124
work it out.

25:23.124 --> 25:32.895
Today is a special day for all of you, is
called as mahabij, the day of mahabij, means

25:32.895 --> 25:38.372
all the mantra’s have a bija and mahabija
of that is Omkara himself.

25:38.397 --> 25:39.854
Omkar.

25:39.879 --> 25:47.678
And it’s the first place, this Omkara was
like an egg, Bramhand, they call it Bramhand.

25:47.773 --> 25:51.725
The whole Bramha becomes a anda (egg).

25:51.725 --> 25:54.235
Because when they say Bramhand even Sanskrit

25:54.260 --> 25:56.506
people don’t know that they are talking of an egg.

25:56.531 --> 25:57.685
Bramhanda.

25:57.991 --> 25:59.661
The anda of Bramha.

25:59.686 --> 26:01.175
That is the first bij.

26:01.200 --> 26:06.085
And how this Bramha, this vibrations, how
they were created.

26:06.085 --> 26:15.805
In the first place, when the Devi separated
from Shiva, before that she had gone around

26:15.805 --> 26:19.134
him as you know.

26:19.134 --> 26:26.535
And then Shiva told her, Sadashiva told her
that you have to now create.

26:26.535 --> 26:29.875
And the separation took place.

26:29.875 --> 26:42.375
So he came out of that pradakshina or you
can call it elliptical form and when he came

26:42.375 --> 26:50.497
out of it that created a kind of a sound.

26:50.522 --> 26:58.798
A sound that had this Bramha in it.

26:58.941 --> 27:04.710
So that Bramha was left in that area.

27:05.314 --> 27:14.555
As I have told you that first the Devi went
round Sadashiva and created a garland.

27:14.555 --> 27:21.582
That garland had covered Shiva in it.

27:21.607 --> 27:23.476
Like the nucleus inside.

27:24.288 --> 27:29.359
But when Sadashiva went out of it created
a sound.

27:29.557 --> 27:43.555
And that sound filled the whole of that andakruti,
means the form of an egg and that is the mahabiija.

27:43.555 --> 27:47.024
That is the Omkara.

27:47.699 --> 28:02.499
And that is reborn as Shri Ganesh and later
on as Jesus Christ.

28:03.334 --> 28:07.796
That’s why at Mahalakshmi’s place you

28:07.821 --> 28:12.090
come with mahabija day, is a very significant thing.

28:12.678 --> 28:22.556
Because Mahalakshmi was the mother of Jesus,
Mary and her son was the incarnation of mahabija.

28:22.613 --> 28:28.761
So to come here on such and such day, and
to do Mahalakshmi’s Puja, is a very big

28:28.786 --> 28:32.290
privilege, is a great privilege for all of
you.

28:32.504 --> 28:44.862
And with that privilege you should humbly
do this puja and try to get into that mahabija,

28:45.084 --> 28:50.882
become one part of that mahabija, which is
this Bramhand.

28:50.907 --> 28:53.956
The whole Branhand, Bramha’s anda.

28:53.956 --> 29:05.765
Anda means egg is created, be part and parcel
of that and not to create any angularity or

29:05.790 --> 29:12.781
any kind of a misrepresentation but be homogeneous
with the whole Bramha.

29:12.806 --> 29:21.255
One has to put attention to your Bramha Shakti
which is manifested as vibrations.

29:21.255 --> 29:27.028
Today the vibrations are so great, that I
didn’t think I would be able to speak on

29:27.053 --> 29:28.877
this, but somehow I have managed.

29:28.902 --> 29:33.361
I hope you all have been able to understand
the subtlest of subtle

29:33.386 --> 29:35.265
that I have talked to you today.

29:35.265 --> 29:40.226
So when you travel with me you should not
think you have come here to see the whole

29:40.226 --> 29:41.460
land and all that.

29:41.476 --> 29:42.722
Or to enjoy life.

29:42.879 --> 29:48.973
You have come here to become the channel of
your Mother’s work.

29:48.998 --> 29:55.119
If you understand that, then you will be able
to realize that God has given you a

29:55.144 --> 29:57.235
very appointed place.

29:57.616 --> 30:01.369
So I would request you, be deserving.

30:01.394 --> 30:02.732
Deserve it.

30:02.757 --> 30:09.128
Assume your seats, coveted places where God
has put you.

30:09.153 --> 30:12.138
May God Bless You.
