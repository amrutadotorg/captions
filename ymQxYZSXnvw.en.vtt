00:13:15.462 --> 00:13:19.105
To all the seekers of truth, I bow.

00:13:22.633 --> 00:13:25.421
Warren has said something today

00:13:26.276 --> 00:13:29.949
which I've been trying
to avoid all these years

00:13:31.011 --> 00:13:35.552
because I thought it was
not advisable at this time

00:13:36.467 --> 00:13:41.920
to talk so directly to
human beings about it.

00:13:43.095 --> 00:13:46.589
Because as soon as
somebody says such a thing

00:13:48.039 --> 00:13:51.134
a snake called ego comes up

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:56.720
or else

00:14:00.036 --> 00:14:04.725
people try to harm the cause.

00:14:04.845 --> 00:14:07.979
They don't want to hear about it.

00:14:08.554 --> 00:14:12.091
This has happened with all
the great incarnations.

00:14:12.235 --> 00:14:15.275
And you have seen how Christ

00:14:15.315 --> 00:14:18.770
was crucified by people because he said

00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:23.347
that "I'm the light, I'm
the path," which He was.

00:14:23.378 --> 00:14:26.267
This was the truth, no doubt.

00:14:26.583 --> 00:14:32.450
But I realized that everything
that is truth is not to be said.

00:14:32.479 --> 00:14:35.477
As He Himself has said

00:14:35.532 --> 00:14:39.689
that "Don't throw your pearls."

00:14:43.448 --> 00:14:48.158
Because who do not understand
the value of the pearls

00:14:51.083 --> 00:14:53.352
will destroy

00:14:54.193 --> 00:14:56.659
out of ignorance

00:14:56.731 --> 00:14:59.302
or out of aggression.

00:15:01.271 --> 00:15:06.024
I have to accept today that in
Australia today is a first moon day

00:15:07.463 --> 00:15:10.542
that what Warren has
said is the truth.

00:15:12.488 --> 00:15:18.363
When people ask me how can it be
possible to have realization so fast

00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:23.977
in India it is not necessary to tell them.
They just know.

00:15:24.923 --> 00:15:28.485
Because Adi Shankarcharya has
written so many books about me.

00:15:28.993 --> 00:15:32.707
And He said it is only She who will
come and give en masse realization.

00:15:34.093 --> 00:15:37.820
What ever you may try
else, it's of no use.

00:15:38.781 --> 00:15:41.296
And that is why,

00:15:41.929 --> 00:15:44.929
it is very easy for
them to recognize me.

00:15:45.708 --> 00:15:49.394
But we have also westernized
Indians in the cities

00:15:49.708 --> 00:15:53.982
which are left to the gurus who
teach them nonsensical things that

00:15:54.054 --> 00:15:57.940
you can achieve God through your sex.

00:15:59.085 --> 00:16:02.138
Because they have certain
weaknesses developed

00:16:04.712 --> 00:16:08.045
and they don't want to
accept Christ at all.

00:16:10.387 --> 00:16:14.081
They accept what these pseudo
gurus are telling them

00:16:15.197 --> 00:16:18.565
and pay money for it an
harm themselves very badly.

00:16:22.189 --> 00:16:26.517
As I told yesterday, Christ has said

00:16:27.753 --> 00:16:30.491
that ten commandments

00:16:31.094 --> 00:16:34.687
it is said "Thou shall
not commit adultry."

00:16:35.396 --> 00:16:38.618
But I say, "Thou shall not
have adultrous eyes."

00:16:39.086 --> 00:16:42.093
What a subtle idea of purity He had.

00:16:43.747 --> 00:16:46.770
Do we understand what
He was saying to us?

00:16:46.778 --> 00:16:51.552
Or thus by going to the church we think
we have become the followers of Christs?

00:16:51.587 --> 00:16:53.674
And that's why He said again,

00:16:53.699 --> 00:16:57.374
"You'll be calling me Christ, Christ.
I won't recognize you."

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.809
That's a fact.

00:17:01.148 --> 00:17:04.309
I'm not against any church

00:17:04.383 --> 00:17:07.475
or any organization whatsoever.

00:17:07.764 --> 00:17:13.120
But when they profess that they are
following a particular ideology

00:17:13.506 --> 00:17:16.522
or a particular incarnation,

00:17:16.562 --> 00:17:19.585
they should not do just the opposite

00:17:20.292 --> 00:17:23.435
what the incarnations taught them.

00:17:26.628 --> 00:17:29.839
It is hard to understand
in these modern times

00:17:30.136 --> 00:17:33.268
that people still have
some faith in Christ.

00:17:37.144 --> 00:17:40.301
Today I'm going to tell
you where He resides

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:42.651
and how we have to awaken Him

00:17:42.682 --> 00:17:45.880
and is so important
about Christ's life

00:17:46.222 --> 00:17:51.018
and why did He die on the cross when
He could kill every one of them

00:17:51.081 --> 00:17:54.136
and destroy the whole universe.

00:17:54.246 --> 00:17:58.656
He has got eleven &lt;i&gt;rudras&lt;/i&gt;. That is He
has got eleven powers to destroy.

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:02.262
When He will come in His real form,

00:18:02.294 --> 00:18:05.571
then there will be no
time for us to think,

00:18:05.619 --> 00:18:08.102
no time for us to meditate,

00:18:08.183 --> 00:18:11.611
no time for Me to counsel
or to redeem you.

00:18:12.722 --> 00:18:15.515
That time is such

00:18:17.032 --> 00:18:20.111
that you will be just sorted out,

00:18:20.619 --> 00:18:24.825
no arguements, no
talking, no questioning.

00:18:25.429 --> 00:18:28.349
You will be just redeemed

00:18:28.715 --> 00:18:33.786
by just being get sent to
the hell or to heaven.

00:18:35.222 --> 00:18:38.275
There won't be any
compromise at that time,

00:18:38.378 --> 00:18:43.545
when His powers of the eleven
&lt;i&gt;rudras&lt;/i&gt; will start working.

00:18:45.246 --> 00:18:49.648
Even today there are people who do not
believe in the incarnation of Christ.

00:18:50.592 --> 00:18:54.372
Very nice because that's
the ego behind them

00:18:54.887 --> 00:18:57.902
and those who pamper
their ego like this

00:19:02.135 --> 00:19:04.333
they like such people.

00:19:06.714 --> 00:19:10.241
We do not understand what
Christ has done for us.

00:19:10.341 --> 00:19:13.093
Let me tell you about

00:19:13.413 --> 00:19:17.028
His own subtle methods by
which He came on this earth.

00:19:19.421 --> 00:19:23.436
In the Devi Puran,

00:19:24.698 --> 00:19:27.394
which you people seldom read,

00:19:29.117 --> 00:19:31.830
I think it is translated in English,

00:19:31.881 --> 00:19:34.260
which was written 14
thousand years back.

00:19:34.286 --> 00:19:37.966
As I told, only 50 years back all
these people came

00:19:38.008 --> 00:19:42.331
and got all the perverted,
useless literature printed

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:46.914
and everbody is basing their
analogies on those 50 years,

00:19:46.994 --> 00:19:52.424
which are nothing compared to the
traditional thousands of years

00:19:52.488 --> 00:19:56.045
which were spent in
India in seeking God.

00:20:00.203 --> 00:20:04.029
Fourteen thousand years back,
Markendaya, a great poet,

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:08.037
has written about Kundalini,

00:20:08.076 --> 00:20:10.593
has written about the Mother.

00:20:11.369 --> 00:20:13.698
He has written about Christ.

00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:16.648
He called Him Mahavishnu

00:20:16.697 --> 00:20:19.579
because He is the son of Vishnu.

00:20:20.593 --> 00:20:25.546
He has described it in such a way that
if you read it you will be amazed.

00:20:25.562 --> 00:20:29.787
You'll think all the special
points of Christ are described.

00:20:30.908 --> 00:20:35.552
He was called as the support,
Adhara, of the universe.

00:20:36.261 --> 00:20:40.284
On Kundalini it can be prooved
also that He was Mahavishnu.

00:20:40.744 --> 00:20:43.046
Because when the Kundalini rises,

00:20:43.086 --> 00:20:46.165
which is a living process as I
told you, is not some humbug

00:20:46.211 --> 00:20:48.934
that you just start
jumping and shooting and

00:20:48.973 --> 00:20:51.409
this thing, all this
kind of a nonsense,

00:20:51.523 --> 00:20:55.185
but when actually you see
pulsation rising within you.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.628
Then you can see very clearly

00:20:58.864 --> 00:21:00.533
that when it stops here

00:21:00.689 --> 00:21:04.985
you have to take the name
of Lord Jesus Christ,

00:21:05.316 --> 00:21:07.437
otherwise it won't open out.

00:21:07.792 --> 00:21:11.763
This position where you
see the agnya chakra is.

00:21:11.848 --> 00:21:17.007
It won't open out unless and until you
take the name of Lord Jesus Christ.

00:21:17.062 --> 00:21:22.956
All over the world whether they were Hindus,
Christians, Muslims or any one, Jews,

00:21:23.189 --> 00:21:25.623
they have to accept Christ,

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.492
as the gate through
which you have to pass.

00:21:29.705 --> 00:21:32.479
Of course other
incarnations are there,

00:21:34.205 --> 00:21:37.179
but He is at this gate through which

00:21:37.958 --> 00:21:40.298
everyone has to pass.

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:42.188
Not by going to church

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:47.452
or by artificial method of baptism,

00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:50.613
but actualization of the baptism.

00:21:50.911 --> 00:21:55.732
It's the actualization is the
point, not artificial things.

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:01.222
And when it crosses that,

00:22:01.315 --> 00:22:05.381
you suddenly find that there
is a suction that takes place

00:22:05.501 --> 00:22:10.708
of these two institutions
of ego and superego.

00:22:10.808 --> 00:22:13.736
That's how it takes away our sins,

00:22:13.911 --> 00:22:15.744
our conditionings,

00:22:16.118 --> 00:22:18.053
and our karmas.

00:22:18.085 --> 00:22:20.657
Everything He sucks in within Himself.

00:22:21.657 --> 00:22:24.101
By that suction you find

00:22:24.189 --> 00:22:28.717
a space is created in the talu
area, in the fontanelle bone area,

00:22:29.721 --> 00:22:32.535
and where the Kundalini
pearces through you can feel

00:22:32.586 --> 00:22:34.872
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:22:35.205 --> 00:22:38.188
That is the real baptism.

00:22:39.507 --> 00:22:42.609
Because the churches could
not deliver the goods,

00:22:43.205 --> 00:22:46.468
people took to another kind of life.

00:22:47.012 --> 00:22:50.017
They are also exactly the same.

00:22:50.284 --> 00:22:52.331
You go to any religion,

00:22:52.379 --> 00:22:55.457
every religion is doing
artificial things.

00:22:56.626 --> 00:22:58.554
For example in the morning

00:22:58.585 --> 00:23:02.073
Muslims are standing saying,
"Allah hu Akar, Allah hu Akbar."

00:23:02.864 --> 00:23:05.627
They don't know where
Akbar exists within them.

00:23:06.188 --> 00:23:08.640
Akbar exists here, is the Virat.

00:23:09.396 --> 00:23:14.320
Is the great Primordial Being
starts from here and is over here

00:23:15.427 --> 00:23:17.431
expressed in the brain.

00:23:18.396 --> 00:23:22.048
There is no connection what
so ever with that Akbar

00:23:24.459 --> 00:23:29.503
and mechanically they
are doing this namaz,

00:23:29.546 --> 00:23:32.511
while namaz is nothing but the
awakening of the kundalini.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:38.276
It can be proved now.

00:23:38.292 --> 00:23:43.308
 Once you get your realization
everything can be proved.

00:23:44.784 --> 00:23:46.791
But you can not force

00:23:46.823 --> 00:23:49.364
truth to be the way you are.

00:23:51.959 --> 00:23:57.243
You can not ask God to
be organized by you.

00:23:59.487 --> 00:24:01.930
You have to surrender to His ways

00:24:02.154 --> 00:24:05.230
and His methods if you want

00:24:05.368 --> 00:24:08.915
to benefit and to become
the higher personality.

00:24:12.098 --> 00:24:16.764
If we are seekers, we
are seekers of truth

00:24:16.939 --> 00:24:18.939
and truth is the Spirit,

00:24:21.956 --> 00:24:26.495
that resides in the
heart of human beings

00:24:27.566 --> 00:24:30.011
is the reflection of God Almighty.

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:39.639
He's the one who represents

00:24:40.179 --> 00:24:42.216
all the three aspects

00:24:42.398 --> 00:24:48.024
of existence, of
creation and evolution.

00:24:52.014 --> 00:24:54.879
He is reflected in your heart.

00:24:55.388 --> 00:24:58.029
Depends on the kind
of a heart you have

00:24:59.491 --> 00:25:01.435
if the heart is clean,

00:25:02.228 --> 00:25:03.958
is beautiful,

00:25:04.657 --> 00:25:07.686
above the mundane things of life,

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:15.157
above the animal instincts within us,

00:25:16.787 --> 00:25:18.658
that heart reflects

00:25:19.184 --> 00:25:21.189
God very easily.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.779
Holy Ghost is the power of God.

00:25:24.835 --> 00:25:29.007
I know in the bible not
much was written about Her,

00:25:31.033 --> 00:25:33.991
because they allowed Him

00:25:34.073 --> 00:25:37.374
just to live for four
years, just imagine.

00:25:38.772 --> 00:25:41.208
I'll tell you about my own life.

00:25:41.264 --> 00:25:46.651
In London I was struggling with 7 sahaja
yogis for 4 years. 7 sahaj yogis.

00:25:46.858 --> 00:25:49.962
It's not easy to crack
that English brain.

00:25:50.806 --> 00:25:52.911
It's a horrible nutty thing,

00:25:53.367 --> 00:25:55.619
thinks no end of itself.

00:25:56.113 --> 00:26:00.704
7 of them, I fought with them for 4 years.
You can not believe.

00:26:00.775 --> 00:26:04.465
In those short period of 4
years what could Christ do?

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.316
What could He achieve? It is not easy.

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:15.236
You know the people
are so ego oriented,

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:20.172
that they can not accept a
carpenter's son to be God,

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:22.287
to be the incarnation.

00:26:23.747 --> 00:26:27.197
It is so difficult for them
to accept any such thing.

00:26:27.793 --> 00:26:30.280
They immediately get identified

00:26:31.057 --> 00:26:34.144
with their riches, with their power,
with all these worldly things,

00:26:34.172 --> 00:26:36.216
which has no meaning to Christ.

00:26:40.715 --> 00:26:45.297
To think that Moses was separate from
Christ is another very big mistake.

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:49.317
There's no difference at all.

00:26:51.308 --> 00:26:55.724
Christ Himself has said, "Those who
are not against Me are with Me."

00:26:55.752 --> 00:26:58.054
Who are those who are against him?

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:04.206
Moses was there on this earth

00:27:05.035 --> 00:27:07.209
to cross only this path.

00:27:07.241 --> 00:27:10.280
It is very symbolic the
way He crossed the sea

00:27:12.169 --> 00:27:14.557
to show how to cross this path.

00:27:14.672 --> 00:27:16.893
He was the incarnation,

00:27:16.941 --> 00:27:20.655
one of the the incarnations,
of the Parmordial Master.

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:25.328
There were ten, great incarnations
of Primordial Masters.

00:27:25.727 --> 00:27:28.480
One of them was Moses,

00:27:29.577 --> 00:27:30.972
Abraham,

00:27:31.956 --> 00:27:33.393
Lao Tze,

00:27:33.694 --> 00:27:35.924
Janaka, Nanak.

00:27:35.946 --> 00:27:38.509
There are ten of them who were major

00:27:40.313 --> 00:27:44.002
incarnations of the same principle.

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:47.081
Mohammed

00:27:48.835 --> 00:27:51.470
They are all related to each other.

00:27:51.519 --> 00:27:54.383
You'll be surprised what
relation exists between them.

00:27:56.236 --> 00:28:00.002
There's no fight, which you
learn in your kundalini.

00:28:00.881 --> 00:28:04.472
They are so intergrated and such
concord exists between them.

00:28:04.521 --> 00:28:06.542
There is no fight at all.

00:28:06.898 --> 00:28:10.257
If there is any fight it is
between the evil and the good.

00:28:10.874 --> 00:28:13.520
But the good is all together.

00:28:15.842 --> 00:28:17.986
They talked of righteousness.

00:28:18.573 --> 00:28:20.613
We want to have God,

00:28:23.137 --> 00:28:25.196
but we don't want to have goodness.

00:28:27.006 --> 00:28:29.557
We go against Him every minute.

00:28:30.236 --> 00:28:33.488
We do every work which
is anti-God activitiy,

00:28:34.426 --> 00:28:37.247
either harming ourselves
or harming others,

00:28:37.982 --> 00:28:40.378
and then we think we
are seekers of God.

00:28:41.275 --> 00:28:45.202
There should be no delusion,
no deception of yourself.

00:28:45.548 --> 00:28:47.265
Please remember,

00:28:47.632 --> 00:28:50.781
this is the last chance.
This is the last judgement.

00:28:51.323 --> 00:28:53.288
This is the resurrection time.

00:28:53.345 --> 00:28:55.828
You have to be very careful about it

00:28:56.448 --> 00:29:00.073
and if you loose your chances now,

00:29:00.764 --> 00:29:05.002
you will have problems later on

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:09.557
of such variety that you
won't be able to solve.

00:29:13.433 --> 00:29:17.248
Already there are signs
of these problems,

00:29:17.289 --> 00:29:19.655
which are incurable,

00:29:19.997 --> 00:29:22.052
which can not be solved,

00:29:23.322 --> 00:29:26.437
which are beyong human solution.

00:29:28.943 --> 00:29:32.937
So we have another center here
which we didn't deal yesterday,

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.309
is the heart center.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:39.363
But before that in this void,

00:29:40.383 --> 00:29:46.349
this place where there is a gap,

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:51.084
ten incarnations, as
I told you, reside

00:29:51.204 --> 00:29:53.338
and they give us the balance.

00:29:53.404 --> 00:29:57.046
The balance of our Being.

00:29:57.856 --> 00:29:59.831
That is the religion.

00:29:59.879 --> 00:30:02.387
The valancy that we have,

00:30:03.052 --> 00:30:06.151
the ten valencies that are within us

00:30:06.299 --> 00:30:08.668
are balanced by this.

00:30:11.399 --> 00:30:14.446
People say that why
should we be righteous?

00:30:15.494 --> 00:30:17.246
All right be not.

00:30:18.058 --> 00:30:20.016
You suffer only in this world.

00:30:21.065 --> 00:30:25.489
Those who think they can make money by
deceiving others are not happy people.

00:30:25.533 --> 00:30:27.387
They can't sleep in the night.

00:30:28.049 --> 00:30:29.693
They have problems.

00:30:29.716 --> 00:30:32.968
All the gurus are sufferning
from diseases and things.

00:30:35.565 --> 00:30:38.082
There are some who can
not even smell flowers.

00:30:38.106 --> 00:30:40.257
You can imagine this
is their situation.

00:30:40.357 --> 00:30:44.754
Flower which is the most beautiful thing
that God has created they can not smell.

00:30:44.778 --> 00:30:49.725
While it is written in all the ancient
scriptures that God is fond of flowers.

00:30:49.757 --> 00:30:51.872
In the name of Shri Vishnu

00:30:52.447 --> 00:30:54.707
there are atleast 15 names which say

00:30:54.721 --> 00:30:57.779
that he is mad after flowers,

00:30:57.819 --> 00:31:00.866
he very fond of flowers,
he must smell the flowers

00:31:05.047 --> 00:31:09.104
and we also know that
God is fond of flowers.

00:31:09.307 --> 00:31:13.306
Somehow we know through our
unconscious understanding

00:31:13.522 --> 00:31:17.237
that God is fond of
everything that is beautiful.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.831
He doesn't like ugliness,

00:31:21.119 --> 00:31:23.511
but beauty that is sublime.

00:31:25.442 --> 00:31:28.469
Now these ten incarnations
came on this earth,

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:31.180
one after another at different places,

00:31:31.363 --> 00:31:33.934
to teach us how to be in balance.

00:31:35.195 --> 00:31:39.398
And they said do this and don't
do that and don't do that.

00:31:40.234 --> 00:31:43.144
But human beings are very good
at finding out loop holes.

00:31:44.941 --> 00:31:46.580
At the time,

00:31:47.348 --> 00:31:49.779
say at Mohammed sahab's time

00:31:50.285 --> 00:31:54.350
they had alcohols, but
no smoking was there.

00:31:56.613 --> 00:32:00.183
So He said, "Alcohol is of no good.

00:32:00.463 --> 00:32:03.366
Should not touch alcohol
because it spoils your liver."

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:05.628
It spoils your awareness is the point.

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:10.850
It goes against your awareness.
He said, "Don't take alcohol."

00:32:12.429 --> 00:32:15.799
But He didn't say don't take smoking.
He didn't know that

00:32:15.851 --> 00:32:19.694
human beings are going to discover
more methods of destroying themselves,

00:32:20.067 --> 00:32:21.678
that they will take to smoking.

00:32:21.765 --> 00:32:25.344
Not that tobacco was not
there in those days.

00:32:25.403 --> 00:32:26.523
It was there.

00:32:26.538 --> 00:32:29.633
But he never said so clearly
that don't take to smoking

00:32:32.117 --> 00:32:34.992
because He did not know
that people going to

00:32:36.871 --> 00:32:39.865
take this insecticide for smoking.

00:32:39.889 --> 00:32:45.230
They will be so stupid to spoil
their center of vishuddhi.

00:32:45.487 --> 00:32:47.619
So He did not say it clearly,

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:49.819
neither He mentioned it I should say.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:55.288
But when he found out that you
all the Muslims were smoking,

00:32:56.453 --> 00:33:00.418
He came back again as Guru Nanaka

00:33:00.666 --> 00:33:05.290
and He prohibited and
He precisely said,

00:33:05.315 --> 00:33:08.495
"Anything that gives you
intoxication should not be taken

00:33:08.535 --> 00:33:10.781
and harms your body
should not be taken."

00:33:10.873 --> 00:33:13.608
But smoking He said,
"Absolutely prohibited."

00:33:15.069 --> 00:33:16.997
He had to correct Himself.

00:33:17.071 --> 00:33:19.918
Because human beings are
such great adventurers

00:33:20.453 --> 00:33:22.037
that every time

00:33:22.095 --> 00:33:25.015
these great incarnations
had to come to tell them,

00:33:25.428 --> 00:33:27.777
"This is a mistake. You
go the other way."

00:33:27.823 --> 00:33:30.506
Then you put them on the other way,
they will start moving that side.

00:33:30.546 --> 00:33:33.109
Not that way now keep in the center.

00:33:33.142 --> 00:33:35.809
Everybody has said,
"Keep in the center."

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:37.101
Keep in the center.

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:40.550
Because the ascent can only
take place in the center.

00:33:40.621 --> 00:33:42.923
Keep in moderation life.

00:33:43.192 --> 00:33:48.692
Any kind of immoderation
takes you to trouble.

00:33:50.526 --> 00:33:53.476
Extremes take you to trouble.

00:33:53.522 --> 00:33:56.318
You have seen now fanataism
where it has gone.

00:33:56.642 --> 00:34:00.641
Fanatics, what has happened to them?
Where are they going?

00:34:01.331 --> 00:34:02.581
How they are behaving?

00:34:02.637 --> 00:34:05.953
They are becoming cruel
people, killing others,

00:34:06.139 --> 00:34:07.974
destroying other human beings.

00:34:08.102 --> 00:34:11.268
Only the human beings
can do such a thing.

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:15.047
No other animal does this
en masse destruction.

00:34:15.873 --> 00:34:18.478
This is a speciality of human beings,

00:34:18.683 --> 00:34:21.828
which are the most
beautiful creation of God.

00:34:23.397 --> 00:34:28.322
God has spent all His energy in
developing you into a human being.

00:34:29.029 --> 00:34:32.691
You can see how beautifully He has
made within you all this thing.

00:34:32.731 --> 00:34:36.412
And despite the fact you have been
always trying to destroy yourself,

00:34:36.485 --> 00:34:38.802
how He is going to help you further.

00:34:39.381 --> 00:34:43.405
How He cleanses you. How
He gives you the bliss.

00:34:43.647 --> 00:34:46.712
You may deserve it or not.
Does not matter.

00:34:46.751 --> 00:34:48.923
It happens to you and you get it.

00:34:49.831 --> 00:34:52.468
This is what one has to realize.

00:34:53.784 --> 00:34:56.283
The Divine is so gracious

00:34:56.409 --> 00:34:59.593
and is so anxious to bestow upon you

00:34:59.735 --> 00:35:03.834
the grace, the beauty, the love,

00:35:04.311 --> 00:35:07.352
by forgiving everything
that you have done.

00:35:08.342 --> 00:35:10.959
So the center that is above that

00:35:11.031 --> 00:35:14.995
is the center what we
call as the heart center

00:35:15.261 --> 00:35:21.025
or in sanskrit language
it is called as Anahata.

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.863
Anahata mean the sound
without permission.

00:35:26.016 --> 00:35:29.785
In the heart you hear the
sound, lub tub, lub tub.

00:35:31.008 --> 00:35:34.436
That is called as Anahat.

00:35:35.227 --> 00:35:39.726
That sound, according to that sound,
this one is called as anahata.

00:35:40.695 --> 00:35:46.004
This center is placed in
the medula oblonguta,

00:35:48.366 --> 00:35:52.990
along the spinal cord,
behind the sternum bone.

00:35:53.355 --> 00:35:57.489
The beauty of these gurus is that
they don't know even the physiology,

00:35:57.593 --> 00:36:00.435
or anatomy or anything of human beings

00:36:00.466 --> 00:36:03.069
and they think they are God.
How can it be?

00:36:03.963 --> 00:36:07.579
You should atleast know what is
inside the body of a human being.

00:36:10.376 --> 00:36:12.566
Now in the sternum bone

00:36:14.281 --> 00:36:16.507
till the age of 12 years

00:36:17.828 --> 00:36:20.099
the antibodies are created

00:36:20.237 --> 00:36:23.279
and the deity is called as Jagadamba,

00:36:23.478 --> 00:36:27.173
meaning Mother of the Universe.

00:36:27.681 --> 00:36:29.502
She resides there.

00:36:30.312 --> 00:36:34.508
On one side She protects Her bhaktas,

00:36:35.319 --> 00:36:39.632
Her children,

00:36:40.052 --> 00:36:41.988
Her true seekers,

00:36:43.194 --> 00:36:46.657
to cross through this
ocean of illusion.

00:36:47.553 --> 00:36:49.941
We live in an ocean of illusion.

00:36:50.761 --> 00:36:55.108
And on the other side
She creates within us

00:36:55.191 --> 00:36:58.100
those antibodies who fight

00:36:58.767 --> 00:37:02.782
all the other anti-God

00:37:03.775 --> 00:37:05.671
or anti-productive

00:37:06.043 --> 00:37:07.941
or anti-life

00:37:08.558 --> 00:37:10.211
agressions on us.

00:37:11.765 --> 00:37:14.971
So these bodies are
created in this part

00:37:15.455 --> 00:37:18.427
and they get distributed
all over the body

00:37:19.201 --> 00:37:21.280
till the age of 12 years.

00:37:22.495 --> 00:37:24.510
After 12 years of age

00:37:25.344 --> 00:37:27.844
this portion is just a communicator.

00:37:29.121 --> 00:37:33.191
So when you see some sort of
a horrible thing or a fear

00:37:33.223 --> 00:37:36.930
that comes into you, this
starts pulsating fast

00:37:37.359 --> 00:37:41.115
and informs with that
frequency, without any doubts,

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:44.869
without any other method of
message, but through reflection,

00:37:47.195 --> 00:37:49.210
the antibodies to fight

00:37:51.044 --> 00:37:56.530
the disease or any other
kind of aggression on them.

00:38:00.222 --> 00:38:04.423
Now this special time

00:38:05.607 --> 00:38:08.564
of an incarnation is alone, single.

00:38:10.392 --> 00:38:12.326
All other incarnations

00:38:12.437 --> 00:38:16.364
have been so far accompanied
by their powers.

00:38:16.909 --> 00:38:22.799
But this one came on this earth
just to protect the seekers.

00:38:23.783 --> 00:38:25.443
Just to remove them

00:38:26.452 --> 00:38:31.887
from their hurdles and their
attacks into safer places

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:34.204
and give them the sense of security.

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:38.380
This is the center of the Mother.

00:38:39.531 --> 00:38:42.385
On a subtler way you must understand

00:38:42.695 --> 00:38:44.758
that it is very important

00:38:44.873 --> 00:38:48.222
to respect the motherhood
in every place.

00:38:48.786 --> 00:38:52.829
Woman is great, not because she
is an actress or a prostitute,

00:38:53.433 --> 00:38:55.575
but because she is a mother.

00:38:56.845 --> 00:38:59.980
Every woman should aspire
to be a good mother.

00:39:00.155 --> 00:39:03.386
That is what you are walking
in the path of God.

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:09.430
This motherhood when is challenged
in the lifetime of women,

00:39:09.782 --> 00:39:13.113
say the husband doesn't
respect her motherhood.

00:39:13.249 --> 00:39:15.646
He runs after other
women who are younger

00:39:15.681 --> 00:39:17.943
or some sort of a thing
that way nowadays.

00:39:19.089 --> 00:39:22.789
She may develop trouble of this center

00:39:23.044 --> 00:39:26.638
and may develop a kind of a

00:39:27.328 --> 00:39:31.912
disease like breast cancer
or any breast trouble.

00:39:33.276 --> 00:39:35.617
If this center is put right,

00:39:35.659 --> 00:39:40.571
breast cancer can be cured completely
without any operation or anything.

00:39:40.735 --> 00:39:43.250
Sahaja yoga has done
that for many people

00:39:43.512 --> 00:39:48.570
and we have saved many people from
going into horrible operations.

00:39:50.368 --> 00:39:54.010
On the left hand side of this,
if you see, is another center.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.486
is of you physical mother.

00:39:57.376 --> 00:40:01.367
The physical mother if she is
doing some anti-God activities

00:40:02.463 --> 00:40:05.035
or if you have been

00:40:06.091 --> 00:40:08.392
nasty to her for nothing at all

00:40:09.273 --> 00:40:12.940
or any such relationship between
her and you is disturbed

00:40:13.456 --> 00:40:16.218
or if she has died very early in life,

00:40:16.789 --> 00:40:19.503
you have never felt the love
of the mother within you,

00:40:19.734 --> 00:40:25.138
you develop this center and such
people lack confidence in life.

00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:27.564
They hang on to people.

00:40:29.382 --> 00:40:32.176
They can be very irritable,

00:40:32.342 --> 00:40:34.974
sometimes getting into tantrums

00:40:35.046 --> 00:40:37.659
and can end up as lunatics also.

00:40:39.922 --> 00:40:41.850
Because the basic thing

00:40:42.406 --> 00:40:45.009
is the security of a
mother in childhood

00:40:46.025 --> 00:40:48.247
and this is what the father has to see

00:40:48.525 --> 00:40:51.342
that you give that
security to that mother

00:40:51.446 --> 00:40:55.072
so that she looks after
her children very well.

00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:59.001
But as a result of the insecurity,

00:40:59.057 --> 00:41:01.953
the women have suffered
in the western countries.

00:41:02.033 --> 00:41:04.628
They thought that money will
give them that security.

00:41:05.112 --> 00:41:07.279
So they have made horrible laws

00:41:08.049 --> 00:41:10.350
and these laws are responsible

00:41:10.626 --> 00:41:15.182
for the irresponsible
behaviour of todays mothers.

00:41:16.634 --> 00:41:18.722
She can never be happy
without a husband

00:41:18.865 --> 00:41:21.841
and husband can never be
happy without a woman.

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:25.343
So why not have one who
loves you and be with her.

00:41:25.979 --> 00:41:28.177
In the same why it
applys to the woman.

00:41:28.701 --> 00:41:31.026
This kind of choice

00:41:31.392 --> 00:41:33.074
which has started in the west.

00:41:33.765 --> 00:41:36.542
After marriage also the choice is on,

00:41:36.622 --> 00:41:38.526
in every thing they go on choosing.

00:41:39.265 --> 00:41:41.605
It's a kind of an ego
trip one must know.

00:41:42.265 --> 00:41:45.074
Like in America I found every

00:41:45.122 --> 00:41:48.097
tap has a different handle,
a different opening.

00:41:48.169 --> 00:41:50.216
You don't know where you
land up in that place

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.764
because you don't know
how to open the door.

00:41:52.812 --> 00:41:55.988
You go into get locked into one
thing you don't know how to open.

00:41:56.015 --> 00:42:00.137
Even the doors of cars
are differently made.

00:42:00.167 --> 00:42:02.604
The four doors could
also differently made,

00:42:02.659 --> 00:42:04.810
because they think it is their choice.

00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:09.226
In everything they say "I like it."
But what is this 'I' that likes it?

00:42:10.792 --> 00:42:15.751
Why waste so much energy on these
things of choices? I can't understand.

00:42:15.799 --> 00:42:19.936
Everytime there is a choice of this
going on, choice of that going on.

00:42:19.954 --> 00:42:21.303
Such a headache it is.

00:42:21.435 --> 00:42:23.728
Why not settle down once for all.

00:42:24.086 --> 00:42:28.850
At a certain age that finished. Now no
more choices. Done. Now lets enjoy it.

00:42:28.871 --> 00:42:34.106
But if you go on choosing, choosing
all your life, you'll be like a

00:42:34.891 --> 00:42:37.882
spinner going round
and round and round,

00:42:38.216 --> 00:42:40.264
without getting anything out of it.

00:42:40.295 --> 00:42:41.918
You must stop

00:42:42.565 --> 00:42:44.652
and enjoy what you have.

00:42:45.367 --> 00:42:48.546
There's no end to it.
It is a mad race.

00:42:48.875 --> 00:42:53.200
I have seen people in England or
America, because now I'm living there.

00:42:54.065 --> 00:42:58.454
They have truck loads of
things going out of the house

00:42:58.835 --> 00:43:00.987
and getting another
truck loads inside.

00:43:01.419 --> 00:43:03.022
So i said, "Why? What's the problem?"

00:43:03.228 --> 00:43:05.794
"Now we don't like it, so
we've thrown it away."

00:43:06.792 --> 00:43:08.484
"Why don't you like it?"

00:43:08.564 --> 00:43:11.742
"Because when we bought it we
were in a different temperment."

00:43:11.796 --> 00:43:13.796
"Now in a different temperment."

00:43:14.197 --> 00:43:15.783
The reason is,

00:43:15.911 --> 00:43:19.756
we do not put our attention
to it, from a deeper side.

00:43:20.411 --> 00:43:26.002
Even one chair made beautifully,
with good vibrations,

00:43:27.129 --> 00:43:29.106
is better than a hundred chairs,

00:43:29.135 --> 00:43:32.394
which are going to become
plastic mountains later on.

00:43:33.431 --> 00:43:36.073
So this is how we go on madly

00:43:36.336 --> 00:43:38.915
possessing things more
and more and more

00:43:39.479 --> 00:43:43.288
and what is lost in that is
the absolute motherhood.

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:46.891
She has to worry so much about
all these plastic things

00:43:47.176 --> 00:43:51.097
and not to worry about the special
thing that is the child in the family.

00:43:51.931 --> 00:43:54.161
The child that has to have the love.

00:43:54.828 --> 00:43:57.113
The child which is to be cared for.

00:43:58.691 --> 00:44:04.021
I mean here till the age of 18 years if
they stay at home is a very big thing.

00:44:05.169 --> 00:44:08.994
But in India, even they
become old 65 year old,

00:44:09.066 --> 00:44:13.022
they won't leave their mother or father.
They stick on to the parents

00:44:13.534 --> 00:44:15.253
and they respect their parents.

00:44:15.375 --> 00:44:17.522
They love them and the
parents also love them.

00:44:17.553 --> 00:44:20.653
Because for them the
children are the highest.

00:44:21.192 --> 00:44:22.965
Nothing is more important.

00:44:23.003 --> 00:44:26.255
All these worldly things are
of no importance at all.

00:44:26.807 --> 00:44:31.224
Even if a child spoils say a carpet,
we say, "All right, it's auspicious."

00:44:31.884 --> 00:44:33.622
We can clean it.

00:44:34.735 --> 00:44:38.346
So the main importance must
be given to the child.

00:44:38.838 --> 00:44:40.422
But not to spoil them.

00:44:40.445 --> 00:44:44.707
The way people handle the children
these days, is just spoiling them,

00:44:45.053 --> 00:44:47.211
buy them expensive presents,

00:44:47.362 --> 00:44:49.402
expensive toys.

00:44:49.513 --> 00:44:52.865
They are busy with the
toys made of plastic.

00:44:54.982 --> 00:44:57.084
But why not talk to them?

00:44:58.323 --> 00:45:00.965
Why not have friendship with them?

00:45:01.203 --> 00:45:02.898
Why not play with them?

00:45:02.944 --> 00:45:07.542
Why to have something in between?
Even if they are sitting together,

00:45:07.583 --> 00:45:09.742
they will have a television,
a third thing going on.

00:45:09.982 --> 00:45:11.537
So there is no rapport.

00:45:12.442 --> 00:45:14.037
How can we live like this?

00:45:14.585 --> 00:45:16.441
If father and child

00:45:16.545 --> 00:45:18.957
and mother and child
can not have rapport,

00:45:19.577 --> 00:45:22.354
how can we have rapport
of the whole world?

00:45:23.251 --> 00:45:25.830
How can we have connection
with the whole world?

00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:29.767
So the motherhood must
take its responsibility,

00:45:30.648 --> 00:45:33.605
must understand that you are
no more a bride, you a mother.

00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:37.327
Be proud of it. It's
great to be mother.

00:45:37.525 --> 00:45:40.140
It's alright for a change
once to be a bride.

00:45:41.101 --> 00:45:43.251
It's really great to be a mother

00:45:43.593 --> 00:45:46.747
and this is what is in this chakra.

00:45:46.831 --> 00:45:51.275
If you are a confident mother,
this center is such a

00:45:53.847 --> 00:45:56.084
great help, support,

00:45:56.918 --> 00:45:58.933
gives you confidence all the time

00:45:59.799 --> 00:46:01.425
and you can not

00:46:01.869 --> 00:46:04.921
feel afraid of anything in this world,

00:46:04.944 --> 00:46:07.333
if you have that center
properly built up within you.

00:46:08.418 --> 00:46:11.048
I know some of you are very
angry with your mothers

00:46:11.122 --> 00:46:13.010
because they have been unkind to you.

00:46:13.035 --> 00:46:16.004
 Forgive them, forgive them,
because they are ignorant.

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:19.419
Because they have been
ignorant forgive them.

00:46:19.439 --> 00:46:24.378
That's the only way you can live
happily, that by forgiving them.

00:46:24.405 --> 00:46:27.105
 And you'll be amazed, if you
forgive them they will come round.

00:46:27.569 --> 00:46:30.177
It will all change once
you get your realization.

00:46:30.355 --> 00:46:32.084
All relationship changes.

00:46:32.402 --> 00:46:35.679
In sahaja yoga all those who
have forsaken their parents,

00:46:35.974 --> 00:46:38.037
have forsaken their
mothers especially,

00:46:38.862 --> 00:46:42.235
have gave got back their mothers and
mothers are also in the sahaja yoga

00:46:42.355 --> 00:46:45.433
and they are all enjoying together.
There's no age difference.

00:46:45.553 --> 00:46:47.933
There's no adolesence
and this and that.

00:46:48.196 --> 00:46:51.737
Everyone enjoys together, speak
the same language of love.

00:46:53.830 --> 00:46:59.703
It's such a beautiful
ocean of human beings,

00:46:59.734 --> 00:47:04.457
as if connected by the same wave
of love that flows through them.

00:47:07.934 --> 00:47:12.632
Now on the right hand side you have
another center, center of the father.

00:47:14.591 --> 00:47:18.290
Father also is a very important thing

00:47:19.815 --> 00:47:24.433
and I think western fathers
are a bit too docile.

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:28.179
That's not a good thing.

00:47:28.534 --> 00:47:32.064
The father has not to be docile.
Mother has to be docile,

00:47:32.942 --> 00:47:34.973
because she is a woman

00:47:35.973 --> 00:47:42.336
and a woman has to have her powers
so great, that she can bear so much.

00:47:42.437 --> 00:47:45.695
She is a powerful thing. She
is the shakti behind the man.

00:47:46.036 --> 00:47:50.100
Men are just like children. Because
you don't know how to handle them,

00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:53.816
that's why it's all problems that you
want to have liberty and liberation.

00:47:53.904 --> 00:47:56.463
You can't live without men.
Try anything.

00:47:57.989 --> 00:48:02.815
But not by dominating them or becoming
like that, but by becoming like women.

00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:07.843
I would say, many people think
that Indian women are dominated,

00:48:07.908 --> 00:48:10.177
but you see our Prime
Minister is a woman.

00:48:11.577 --> 00:48:13.481
Nobody can dominate us.

00:48:13.813 --> 00:48:15.632
We live with our values

00:48:16.377 --> 00:48:18.561
and they can't live without us,

00:48:18.679 --> 00:48:20.750
because they know how
substancial we are.

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:23.886
We have estabilished
that within their minds.

00:48:24.504 --> 00:48:28.321
That's how you know that we have
very few divorces or anything.

00:48:28.512 --> 00:48:31.162
Woman is respected because
she is respectful.

00:48:31.504 --> 00:48:33.996
She will not be respected
because she has money.

00:48:34.845 --> 00:48:37.035
She will not be respected
if she is dominating.

00:48:37.353 --> 00:48:41.162
She will not be respected if
she tries to have her own way.

00:48:41.909 --> 00:48:44.170
But she is respected
because she is respectful.

00:48:44.909 --> 00:48:47.043
Her ways are such that
you have to respect her.

00:48:47.687 --> 00:48:49.515
You just can't help it.

00:48:49.626 --> 00:48:53.570
You have to respect your woman and
that's what a woman has to be.

00:48:53.593 --> 00:48:57.369
She is much above man and she
should not try to stoop down

00:48:57.404 --> 00:48:59.967
to the level of men,
wearing pants and things.

00:49:00.039 --> 00:49:02.296
I mean if anybody ask me to wear that,

00:49:02.391 --> 00:49:04.698
I would say this sari is
the much better dress

00:49:04.829 --> 00:49:07.852
for me because the sari gives

00:49:08.094 --> 00:49:10.179
food to thousands of Indians,

00:49:10.259 --> 00:49:14.298
thousands of villagers,
they make the sari.

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:18.007
How can we forget that we are women?

00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:21.292
Men are men and women are women.

00:49:21.579 --> 00:49:23.681
Don't take these funny ideas.

00:49:24.110 --> 00:49:27.792
You see you can't put your
nose here and your eyes here.

00:49:28.118 --> 00:49:31.634
They are placed at right places. God
has placed you in right places.

00:49:32.007 --> 00:49:33.927
Now don't try to shift them.

00:49:34.044 --> 00:49:35.578
That you can not do.

00:49:35.649 --> 00:49:39.928
In no way I would tell
you, you can be humiliated

00:49:40.006 --> 00:49:43.205
or subjugated, if you
establish your importance.

00:49:44.221 --> 00:49:48.903
If you estabilish it with proper
understanding, it is you who can bear.

00:49:49.086 --> 00:49:51.347
You are like this mother earth around.

00:49:52.007 --> 00:49:54.626
Mother earth gives us everything.
She bears up.

00:49:54.666 --> 00:49:57.737
Can we do without the mother
earth, specially Australians?

00:49:58.706 --> 00:50:01.943
She is the one who is giving
you all your ores, everything.

00:50:02.785 --> 00:50:05.626
You can't exist without her and
how much she is bearing up?

00:50:07.586 --> 00:50:10.491
So many things you have done against
God, but She is bearing it up.

00:50:10.571 --> 00:50:12.746
Of course She'll become
volcanic one day,

00:50:12.786 --> 00:50:14.920
if you try to be too much like this.

00:50:15.158 --> 00:50:18.237
You have to take to God
because She is one with God.

00:50:19.094 --> 00:50:21.919
She is absolutely one
with God and She knows.

00:50:22.325 --> 00:50:24.689
She forgives you because
God forgives you.

00:50:25.483 --> 00:50:27.673
So we have to take the methods of God

00:50:27.721 --> 00:50:29.816
and not of our own ego

00:50:29.896 --> 00:50:32.435
and of our own ideas. "What's wrong?"

00:50:34.571 --> 00:50:39.266
This Mother earth, as She bears us,
the woman has to bear all the family.

00:50:40.634 --> 00:50:43.364
In my own work as a mother,

00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:48.080
I have seen people coming and
insulting me, misbehaving.

00:50:48.096 --> 00:50:50.943
All kinds of things they have done to me.
There is no end to it.

00:50:52.475 --> 00:50:56.467
But to me it's a joke.
They are all children.

00:50:57.372 --> 00:51:01.673
They are stupid. They are foolish.
They'll be alright.

00:51:02.871 --> 00:51:06.451
I don't loose my temper.
I'm unruffled.

00:51:07.404 --> 00:51:10.322
One lady one came with a
bible to hit me hard.

00:51:11.157 --> 00:51:15.951
In a temple and they have taken my
tv and I'm just laughing at her.

00:51:15.983 --> 00:51:18.514
I couldn't understand how could
she use a bible to hit me?

00:51:18.554 --> 00:51:21.681
Something else she could have had.

00:51:23.435 --> 00:51:26.665
But it is so. It's so
surprising you see

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.943
that how people are in a paradox

00:51:30.118 --> 00:51:31.943
and such a confusion.

00:51:32.007 --> 00:51:34.935
A complete confusion exists now.

00:51:35.372 --> 00:51:39.292
Only way to get rid of it
is to become your Spirit.

00:51:39.943 --> 00:51:41.879
Because Spirit is absolute.

00:51:42.022 --> 00:51:45.371
It is absolutely there within you,

00:51:45.412 --> 00:51:47.943
which is the absolute.
It's not relative.

00:51:48.277 --> 00:51:50.308
We live in a relative world.

00:51:51.054 --> 00:51:53.284
We haven't got our absolute values.

00:51:53.959 --> 00:51:58.840
But Spirit when it manifests you start
feeling these vibrations of cool breeze.

00:51:58.919 --> 00:52:02.267
All over you start feeling
this all pervading power.

00:52:02.356 --> 00:52:04.268
And you ask any absolute question

00:52:04.324 --> 00:52:06.554
and you get an absolute answer to it,

00:52:07.023 --> 00:52:09.109
an absolute answer to it.

00:52:09.285 --> 00:52:11.292
Because what ever you are doing

00:52:11.539 --> 00:52:14.419
you are doing in a relative way.

00:52:14.586 --> 00:52:19.684
Because you are harmed, because you
are supressed, you have a reaction.

00:52:19.850 --> 00:52:23.038
Because that thing has happened to
you, that's why there is a reaction.

00:52:23.559 --> 00:52:26.012
Reaction is not the
way we have to live.

00:52:26.043 --> 00:52:28.964
We have to live on our absolute wealth

00:52:29.051 --> 00:52:33.043
and that is the Spirit within us,
which has to come in our attention.

00:52:33.106 --> 00:52:37.110
Means, it has to manifest in
our central nervous system.

00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:41.114
Now beyond that is the center here.

00:52:41.218 --> 00:52:43.297
So about fathers I have to say

00:52:43.385 --> 00:52:46.503
that fathers have to be very
kind to their children.

00:52:47.123 --> 00:52:50.194
They are not to shout at women.
They have to respect.

00:52:50.718 --> 00:52:53.519
They must respect because she
is the goddess of the family.

00:52:54.250 --> 00:52:56.273
If they respect her there
won't be any problem.

00:52:56.765 --> 00:52:58.082
I can tell you this much.

00:52:58.369 --> 00:53:02.582
If you don't know how to respect
your women, they can become shrews.

00:53:03.501 --> 00:53:05.540
They can become horrid things.

00:53:05.588 --> 00:53:08.790
You see you make them what ever
you want to do, you make them.

00:53:08.830 --> 00:53:12.509
Whatever your ideas, if you run after
prostitutes, they'll become prostitutes.

00:53:13.154 --> 00:53:16.440
If you run after another men,
they willl run after another men.

00:53:16.512 --> 00:53:18.948
If you run after money,
they'll run after money.

00:53:18.996 --> 00:53:20.717
What ever you do, they will do.

00:53:21.075 --> 00:53:23.495
So it is the men who
spoil the society.

00:53:23.837 --> 00:53:27.233
But the women must have their courage

00:53:27.845 --> 00:53:32.321
to stand up to it, because for the
society the women are responsible.

00:53:33.043 --> 00:53:35.463
If children are the
most important thing,

00:53:35.512 --> 00:53:39.186
then for a mother the society
is the most important thing

00:53:39.265 --> 00:53:43.440
and she keeps up the society
in a proper method by

00:53:43.496 --> 00:53:47.979
educating her children to be
good citizens of that society.

00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:53.162
But if your father is a cruel man,

00:53:53.781 --> 00:53:56.709
or if you have lost your
father in your childhood,

00:53:57.234 --> 00:54:01.491
or maybe there is some problem
between you and your father,

00:54:01.563 --> 00:54:03.773
 or if you have been
a very bad father,

00:54:04.393 --> 00:54:08.852
or the children are tortured by you,

00:54:09.638 --> 00:54:13.878
or you have lost some child early,

00:54:13.995 --> 00:54:18.598
all these things the principle
of father gets into problem.

00:54:19.004 --> 00:54:20.955
And when this is in problem

00:54:21.546 --> 00:54:24.982
you get asthma.

00:54:25.656 --> 00:54:28.227
Asthma comes because of this.

00:54:28.791 --> 00:54:30.894
Asthma can be easily cured,

00:54:31.265 --> 00:54:33.368
if you can assure the fatherhood

00:54:33.506 --> 00:54:37.928
to be settled down through the
vibrations, asthma can be cured.

00:54:37.957 --> 00:54:41.372
 I have cured an asthma of
the governer of Kashmir,

00:54:41.464 --> 00:54:45.562
 who was suffering from 25
years, within 10 minutes time.

00:54:45.716 --> 00:54:49.030
It is very easy to cure
asthma, which can cured.

00:54:49.330 --> 00:54:55.069
Because the compassion that people talk
of, love, love, love, it doesn't work.

00:54:56.607 --> 00:54:59.996
God's compassion works. It works.

00:55:00.647 --> 00:55:02.562
It doesn't talk about itself

00:55:02.589 --> 00:55:05.542
that" I am love, I am
compassion", nothing of the kind.

00:55:06.639 --> 00:55:11.020
It just works. You can feel it.
It works because it redeems you,

00:55:15.298 --> 00:55:16.980
gives you salvation,

00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:18.694
gives you realization,

00:55:19.052 --> 00:55:21.051
gives you all that is the best.

00:55:21.377 --> 00:55:25.026
It is the benefitial force which acts

00:55:25.081 --> 00:55:29.269
and you see it every moment and you
are amazed how you are looked after

00:55:29.805 --> 00:55:32.051
by this great force of compassion.

00:55:32.663 --> 00:55:36.107
Sometimes you feel as if the
angels are taking you up somewhere

00:55:36.266 --> 00:55:38.512
and you are avoiding all
the hurdles of life.

00:55:39.179 --> 00:55:41.448
It's so amazing if you
talk to sahaj yogis,

00:55:41.584 --> 00:55:45.567
you will think these people are
talking something imaginary.

00:55:45.623 --> 00:55:47.734
But it's a fact. It's a fact.

00:55:48.211 --> 00:55:51.440
But to establish yourself into
sahaja yoga is difficult,

00:55:52.369 --> 00:55:55.363
because we have no outer
ways of doing it.

00:55:55.387 --> 00:55:58.099
Like we can not say
you pay your money,

00:55:58.219 --> 00:55:59.845
or you become your member,

00:55:59.917 --> 00:56:02.567
or we can say that all
right now supposing

00:56:02.607 --> 00:56:05.631
you all to become a
sahaja yogi we give you a

00:56:05.711 --> 00:56:08.758
plate here or plaque here
and all that, not possible.

00:56:09.266 --> 00:56:11.789
You have to actually become, inside.

00:56:12.076 --> 00:56:13.726
There's no hipocracy about it.

00:56:14.838 --> 00:56:18.408
You have to be inside. There's
no pronouncemnt about it.

00:56:19.504 --> 00:56:22.845
It has to be inside,
something has to happen.

00:56:22.901 --> 00:56:25.655
You have to be transformed actually.

00:56:27.242 --> 00:56:29.218
Has to be honestly done.

00:56:29.282 --> 00:56:31.480
It should be a truth

00:56:31.631 --> 00:56:34.543
and not a myth, with
which you have to live.

00:56:36.972 --> 00:56:39.533
So we have another center
which is very important,

00:56:39.558 --> 00:56:41.184
 is called as the vishuddhi chakra.

00:56:42.576 --> 00:56:48.240
This is the center presided
by Shri Krishna himself.

00:56:49.681 --> 00:56:52.455
Shri Krishna actually first manifests

00:56:52.626 --> 00:56:54.709
at the solar plexis

00:56:55.527 --> 00:56:56.647
as Shri Vishnu.

00:56:57.828 --> 00:57:00.891
The power of Vishnu is
Laxshmi at that point.

00:57:01.709 --> 00:57:05.232
Laxshmi is the power by which

00:57:06.225 --> 00:57:09.629
people get the blessings
of the Goddess,

00:57:10.431 --> 00:57:11.867
on material level,

00:57:12.233 --> 00:57:14.415
but not the way we understand it.

00:57:15.487 --> 00:57:18.375
Laxshmi is a Godess because She
is a woman, She is a mother.

00:57:18.447 --> 00:57:21.875
First of all a man who is
wealthy has to be motherly.

00:57:22.003 --> 00:57:23.661
That you don't find anywhere.

00:57:24.721 --> 00:57:28.784
Then there are the image
is made so beautifully

00:57:28.847 --> 00:57:30.836
that in the hands there
are two lotuses.

00:57:31.669 --> 00:57:33.338
They are pink in colour.

00:57:34.075 --> 00:57:36.495
The pink colour suggests the love.

00:57:37.694 --> 00:57:40.749
The house should be cozy like a lotus.

00:57:41.511 --> 00:57:45.312
And there's a very, I don't
know what you call it,

00:57:45.543 --> 00:57:48.400
gnat or something, you
call it a gnat,I think,

00:57:48.495 --> 00:57:51.463
that horrible insect

00:57:51.495 --> 00:57:55.082
gnat like think that has got
lots of thorns on its body,

00:57:55.583 --> 00:57:57.487
also enters into this

00:57:59.091 --> 00:58:01.003
delicate lotus,

00:58:01.926 --> 00:58:03.830
but it has a place to rest.

00:58:05.037 --> 00:58:08.219
It does not judge

00:58:08.457 --> 00:58:11.124
the outward thing of a person.

00:58:12.227 --> 00:58:15.806
So it has to be a cozy
place, a welcome place,

00:58:16.395 --> 00:58:19.553
where people should
enter and be happy.

00:58:20.823 --> 00:58:23.228
That is called as a laxshmi pati,

00:58:23.284 --> 00:58:26.902
the one who is rich, in the sense
he is the owner of laxshmi.

00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:30.474
Then one hand is like this
another hand is like that.

00:58:30.966 --> 00:58:33.831
The hand like this
means he is the giver.

00:58:33.966 --> 00:58:36.640
He has to be extremely generous.

00:58:37.093 --> 00:58:40.196
All the time flowing, the generosity.

00:58:41.085 --> 00:58:43.752
Generosity not to
wrong type of people,

00:58:45.117 --> 00:58:47.037
but to the people who are needy.

00:58:47.696 --> 00:58:50.394
But he doesn't say that I am giving.

00:58:50.895 --> 00:58:53.878
He doesn't talk about it.
He just does it secretly.

00:58:54.554 --> 00:58:56.220
And this hand like this

00:58:56.927 --> 00:58:59.505
is the hand for protection.

00:58:59.649 --> 00:59:01.061
Protection to the weak.

00:59:01.458 --> 00:59:04.498
Protection to people who
do not have so much.

00:59:05.259 --> 00:59:09.013
This is the sign of a
laxshmi pati, a rich man.

00:59:09.823 --> 00:59:11.823
And she stands on the lotus,

00:59:12.363 --> 00:59:16.577
means she doesn' t exsert
her pressure on anyone.

00:59:17.363 --> 00:59:19.839
She doesn't exsert pressure on anyone.

00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:23.117
Is a very beautiful image mande

00:59:23.141 --> 00:59:25.168
of the power of Shri Vishnu,

00:59:25.366 --> 00:59:29.934
who is the aspect of God
which gives us our evolution,

00:59:30.125 --> 00:59:32.442
The force which gives
us our evolution.

00:59:32.633 --> 00:59:37.196
The force by which, that aspect by
which, we have become human beings.

00:59:37.458 --> 00:59:41.259
This is the whole thing is called
as the power of Mahalaxshmi.

00:59:41.673 --> 00:59:48.097
And Christ's Mother was the incarnation
of this Mahalaxshmi, of the great.

00:59:48.653 --> 00:59:51.561
 Mahalaxshmi represents

00:59:54.189 --> 00:59:55.442
the seeking,

00:59:56.895 --> 00:59:58.585
the power of seeking,

00:59:59.379 --> 01:00:01.299
of highest goal,

01:00:02.379 --> 01:00:05.394
seeking of God,

01:00:06.252 --> 01:00:09.212
seeking of your spiritual ascent.

01:00:09.942 --> 01:00:12.196
She was representing that.

01:00:13.022 --> 01:00:14.442
And that's how

01:00:14.998 --> 01:00:16.371
She came on this earth.

01:00:17.435 --> 01:00:19.299
She was to an Indian

01:00:19.371 --> 01:00:21.577
people she was told that She was

01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:23.577
Mahalaxshmi they can't believe it.

01:00:24.292 --> 01:00:27.886
They She was crying all the
while, how was She a Mahalaxshmi?

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:30.410
To them it doesn't go into their heads

01:00:30.863 --> 01:00:33.688
that how can a person who
is a Mahalaxshmi could be

01:00:33.855 --> 01:00:35.767
 just a mother crying for her son.

01:00:37.196 --> 01:00:41.799
 but why she was not she exposed
us, Warren has told you.

01:00:42.085 --> 01:00:45.244
that if Christ has mentioned that

01:00:45.292 --> 01:00:48.664
She is Mahalaxshmi, the Adi
Shakti, or the Holy Ghost

01:00:48.752 --> 01:00:50.783
 people would have attacked Her first,

01:00:51.355 --> 01:00:53.140
instead of attacking Him

01:00:53.935 --> 01:00:55.601
and that was not the game

01:00:55.823 --> 01:00:59.901
The drama was for Christ
to get Himself crusified.

01:00:59.953 --> 01:01:04.663
And why Christ ? Because Christ
is the embodiment of the Spirit.

01:01:05.308 --> 01:01:08.386
He's made of these vibrations

01:01:08.593 --> 01:01:11.926
He's Omkara. He's without body.
He's a bodiless person.

01:01:12.903 --> 01:01:14.648
It's only He who could do it.

01:01:15.183 --> 01:01:18.942
Nobody, no other
incarnation is like that.

01:01:19.522 --> 01:01:21.950
All other incarnations
come on this earth,

01:01:22.204 --> 01:01:24.069
they have to have a body.

01:01:24.593 --> 01:01:26.672
But He was made specially.

01:01:28.323 --> 01:01:32.783
The body was taken down. It's a big
story, which I'll tell you later on.

01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:36.350
But the part that was the
Spirit Christ was made,

01:01:36.469 --> 01:01:40.545
because the message was
resurrection and not crucifixion.

01:01:42.958 --> 01:01:45.820
Resurrection means He passed
through this cross here.

01:01:45.963 --> 01:01:51.894
You see the agnya is between the
ego and superego overlapping

01:01:52.022 --> 01:01:55.654
and when we have a very thick
conditioning and a thick ego,

01:01:55.718 --> 01:01:57.836
just there is no space at all.

01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:02.212
And it is He who came and
established Himself there,

01:02:02.522 --> 01:02:04.878
in that little space, because

01:02:05.831 --> 01:02:08.275
He is chaitanya,

01:02:08.617 --> 01:02:14.906
he is this subtle power omkara.

01:02:18.621 --> 01:02:22.708
It's all described. What ever I'm
telling you is not my story.

01:02:22.986 --> 01:02:25.136
It's all described about Him.

01:02:25.232 --> 01:02:28.129
Unfortunately you people
have not read these books.

01:02:28.383 --> 01:02:32.224
But you can later on after
realization get to these books

01:02:32.288 --> 01:02:35.192
and understand what I'm
telling is true or not.

01:02:36.113 --> 01:02:39.748
If you have to depend on books, but
if you have to depend on vibrations

01:02:39.947 --> 01:02:42.843
you can ask the question,
'Was He Omkara?'

01:02:45.550 --> 01:02:47.367
So He crosses over

01:02:48.018 --> 01:02:50.335
into the limbic area.

01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:58.263
Here, which is the kingdom of God and
that is why He's called as the gate.

01:02:59.613 --> 01:03:04.533
But Vishuddhi chakra is the one which
is bestoyed upon by Shri Krishna,

01:03:04.978 --> 01:03:07.660
who is actually the

01:03:08.113 --> 01:03:11.898
evolved manifestation of Shri Vishnu.

01:03:12.939 --> 01:03:15.589
The story of Shri
Vishnu's incarnations

01:03:15.732 --> 01:03:18.089
suggest that we have gone

01:03:18.185 --> 01:03:22.375
through different, various
aspects of evolution.

01:03:22.796 --> 01:03:25.763
If Christ has not
talked about evolution,

01:03:25.867 --> 01:03:28.041
that doesn't mean He did not know it.

01:03:28.343 --> 01:03:30.660
People never gave Him
any chance to talk.

01:03:30.748 --> 01:03:34.351
Even Darwin had no
business to criticize Him.

01:03:35.177 --> 01:03:38.748
He Himself has said, "We have come
so far we have to go further"

01:03:38.962 --> 01:03:42.009
and Christ also said, "You
have to be born again".

01:03:42.642 --> 01:03:46.245
Christ also said the same thing in
His own words, in His own style.

01:03:47.285 --> 01:03:49.753
In evolutionary process is described,

01:03:49.785 --> 01:03:52.446
in the dashavatars, in
the 10 incarnations,

01:03:52.482 --> 01:03:54.777
which is exactly the
same as has happened.

01:03:55.515 --> 01:03:56.991
First is the fish

01:03:57.555 --> 01:04:00.443
and then is the turtoise.

01:04:01.023 --> 01:04:02.832
I know Indian names so I.

01:04:02.983 --> 01:04:05.570
Then is the quadruped

01:04:05.602 --> 01:04:08.054
Like that it moves
from one to another.

01:04:08.126 --> 01:04:09.864
Then a small man

01:04:10.237 --> 01:04:14.022
and then a large man
and then Shri Rama.

01:04:14.325 --> 01:04:18.149
Shri Rama resides on the right side, as
the father, right side of the heart.

01:04:21.539 --> 01:04:24.507
So now Vishuddhi chakra
is Shri Krishna's one.

01:04:24.801 --> 01:04:29.269
He came 2000 years
after Shri Rama came.

01:04:30.118 --> 01:04:34.245
Like Treta and Dvapara, we have two
yugas out of which he came here.

01:04:34.356 --> 01:04:36.872
There are many people who
say they are Shri Krishna

01:04:36.904 --> 01:04:40.149
and they don't know any thing about Him.
They don't know anything

01:04:41.761 --> 01:04:43.872
and to the ninth people.

01:04:44.809 --> 01:04:47.665
They can't understand that how
this man is Shri Krishna.

01:04:49.055 --> 01:04:52.206
It's very easy to say I'm Christ,
you see the other day in London,

01:04:52.249 --> 01:04:54.237
somebody told me, "Mother
he is saying I'm Christ".

01:04:54.293 --> 01:04:57.340
"All right," I said, "you ask
him to walk on the water".

01:04:57.507 --> 01:05:01.340
That's the sign. Find out.
It's very easy.

01:05:01.515 --> 01:05:05.530
If I say I'm Adi Shakti or Holy
Ghost let me give you realization.

01:05:05.650 --> 01:05:09.268
That's the sign given that She raises
the kundalini of thousands of people.

01:05:09.531 --> 01:05:10.935
It's described already.

01:05:12.785 --> 01:05:14.792
But if he said he was Christ,

01:05:15.094 --> 01:05:17.294
then let him walk on the
water you will say

01:05:18.888 --> 01:05:23.065
and the one who says he is Shri
Krishna he has samhara shakti.

01:05:23.086 --> 01:05:26.311
So many, there are so many thing
by which you can make it out

01:05:26.362 --> 01:05:30.308
a person who describe
themselves as this and that.

01:05:32.333 --> 01:05:37.649
So now we have come to this
Vishuddhi chakra which 16 petals

01:05:38.785 --> 01:05:40.594
and these 16 petals

01:05:42.182 --> 01:05:45.569
represent 16 sub-plexuses

01:05:45.705 --> 01:05:47.483
of the cervical plexus.

01:05:47.689 --> 01:05:50.181
Now these are all gross
plexuses outside,

01:05:50.451 --> 01:05:52.832
but in the subtle it
is Vishuddhi chakra,

01:05:52.936 --> 01:05:57.522
with all the vowels, the 16
vowels as the bija matras in it.

01:05:58.839 --> 01:06:03.172
This is the most important
center for human beings

01:06:03.196 --> 01:06:05.744
 because when human
beings raised their head

01:06:06.324 --> 01:06:10.157
this center started becoming
complete by itself.

01:06:11.491 --> 01:06:16.245
By raising it only we have
created this ego business.

01:06:17.277 --> 01:06:19.406
Because we raised our head

01:06:21.951 --> 01:06:25.657
we actually symbolized
it with our freedom.

01:06:27.522 --> 01:06:29.442
This I-ness develops.

01:06:30.086 --> 01:06:32.824
As this ego develops within us,

01:06:33.594 --> 01:06:37.252
the ego and super ego both meet
at the fontanelle bone area.

01:06:37.405 --> 01:06:39.310
By about 12 years of age

01:06:39.416 --> 01:06:41.507
it becomes absolutely calcified

01:06:41.673 --> 01:06:43.601
and we develop our I-ness.

01:06:44.396 --> 01:06:48.054
Before this we are under the
complete control of the nature

01:06:48.562 --> 01:06:52.157
that's far as animals
are called as pashu.

01:06:52.499 --> 01:06:54.364
Pashu means the pa shakti,

01:06:54.459 --> 01:06:57.229
the control of God, control of nature.

01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:59.887
But human beings have
been given freedom

01:07:00.515 --> 01:07:03.245
and individuality to grow.

01:07:03.816 --> 01:07:06.530
Because if you have to go
to the supreme freedom

01:07:07.134 --> 01:07:09.419
you have to know what freedom is

01:07:10.062 --> 01:07:13.736
and in that freedom, of course it
could have been short circuited also

01:07:13.824 --> 01:07:17.237
if Adam and Eve had listened
to God, but they did not.

01:07:19.134 --> 01:07:22.395
They just wanted to find out for
themselves when the freedom was given

01:07:22.475 --> 01:07:26.610
and the mistake was carried on to this
extent that the incarnations had to come

01:07:26.666 --> 01:07:28.991
to correct it and it was
such a long process.

01:07:29.911 --> 01:07:32.022
And now it has come to this position

01:07:32.062 --> 01:07:34.403
that to achieve that supreme freedom

01:07:34.459 --> 01:07:38.062
you must learn to use
your freedom properly.

01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:40.538
This is trial and error man tries.

01:07:40.705 --> 01:07:42.784
I have seen many people.

01:07:43.428 --> 01:07:46.268
I went to Tehran once.

01:07:46.578 --> 01:07:49.586
I saw many Muslims sitting before me

01:07:49.928 --> 01:07:52.095
and I thought and they looked

01:07:52.111 --> 01:07:55.155
like brahmins of India,

01:07:55.211 --> 01:07:56.935
who were another fanatic group.

01:07:57.523 --> 01:08:00.819
They are not brahmins because
they say they are brahmins.

01:08:00.852 --> 01:08:02.478
They don't know anything of Brahma.

01:08:03.055 --> 01:08:06.760
So they looked exactly like those
brahmins in their past lives.

01:08:06.912 --> 01:08:12.554
That means these extreme people from India
are born as muslims to hate themselves

01:08:13.158 --> 01:08:17.689
and this extreme movement goes on like
a pendulum from one to another end

01:08:17.959 --> 01:08:22.312
till you come to a point where you
understand that fanaticism is wrong.

01:08:22.328 --> 01:08:23.757
This extreme behaviour is wrong.

01:08:23.845 --> 01:08:27.670
This why do I do it to such an extent?
Can I not come to moderation?

01:08:27.741 --> 01:08:32.194
and the family system is one of
them which makes you understand

01:08:32.416 --> 01:08:35.049
that balance in life is very good,

01:08:35.907 --> 01:08:37.938
without the balance and moderation

01:08:38.311 --> 01:08:40.549
you can not have proper
growth or proper children.

01:08:41.055 --> 01:08:43.513
A day will come if
you go on like this,

01:08:43.536 --> 01:08:45.548
you will have children
who'll be just devils.

01:08:45.915 --> 01:08:48.938
I have seen children in England
some of them are really devils.

01:08:49.183 --> 01:08:50.553
Absolutely devilish,

01:08:50.585 --> 01:08:56.673
some children kill their grandmother and
grandfather rocking her and his chairs.

01:08:56.689 --> 01:08:57.705
Can you believe it such a thing.

01:08:57.745 --> 01:09:01.001
Only six, seven year old children.
Devils actually.

01:09:01.407 --> 01:09:06.808
Six, seven years old children they kill
their grandmother and grandfather like that

01:09:07.153 --> 01:09:09.557
and in England it is said that

01:09:09.621 --> 01:09:12.469
two children are killed
every week by the parents.

01:09:12.486 --> 01:09:14.462
I mean this is devilish.

01:09:14.716 --> 01:09:16.914
Even the devils don't do that I think.

01:09:17.748 --> 01:09:21.359
It is done by human beings and
how can children be born there?

01:09:22.081 --> 01:09:25.574
What child would like to be born in a
country where there is no love for them?

01:09:25.702 --> 01:09:29.051
Perhaps that's why India is suffering
so much with over population.

01:09:29.805 --> 01:09:32.749
All the children must be wanting
to be born in our country,

01:09:32.884 --> 01:09:36.328
and also your children who are seeking
God are coming to our country.

01:09:36.388 --> 01:09:39.995
Of course they fall atrap. They fall
into wrong traps. It's all right.

01:09:40.321 --> 01:09:42.146
But they are seeking.

01:09:43.361 --> 01:09:46.249
They are seekers and that's
why they are going to India

01:09:46.392 --> 01:09:49.138
and in India you can seek it better.

01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:52.281
Because that's a country
of love and affection.

01:09:52.456 --> 01:09:56.154
But these people do no come in
contact with any Indians at all.

01:09:56.170 --> 01:10:00.238
Because Indians don't like these gurus at all.
They have nothing to do with these Indians.

01:10:02.535 --> 01:10:04.828
They are hated by all the Indians.

01:10:05.432 --> 01:10:07.352
They think they are inauspicious.

01:10:07.654 --> 01:10:09.725
Where ever they stay there is fire.

01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:12.233
Where ever they stay
there is bad time.

01:10:12.262 --> 01:10:16.477
No one likes except for business people
who try to make money out of these.

01:10:18.128 --> 01:10:19.805
Indians have no rapport.

01:10:19.829 --> 01:10:22.408
But you should ask sahaj
yogis, they go to villages.

01:10:22.461 --> 01:10:26.000
How they mix up with Indian. How they talk
to them. How they have lived with them.

01:10:26.168 --> 01:10:27.692
They live with them in their huts.

01:10:27.716 --> 01:10:33.366
We live with them with their beautiful
generousity that they have.

01:10:35.096 --> 01:10:39.064
So Vishuddhi chakra, which is
the chakra of Shri Krishna,

01:10:39.684 --> 01:10:44.318
is to be understood that ultimately
this becomes the Virat, the primordial.

01:10:45.501 --> 01:10:48.445
So the heart,

01:10:49.779 --> 01:10:54.191
which is the reflexion
of the God Almighty,

01:10:55.112 --> 01:10:57.881
has three aspects, as I told you.

01:10:58.461 --> 01:11:01.135
The first aspect is of existence,

01:11:01.461 --> 01:11:04.239
which is expressed in the left side

01:11:04.707 --> 01:11:08.818
power of existence and when existence
finishes also it is destruction.

01:11:09.644 --> 01:11:14.079
So it is called as the giver of
existence, as well as destroyer.

01:11:14.707 --> 01:11:18.160
The another one, on the right
hand side, is the creator

01:11:19.985 --> 01:11:23.200
and the center one is one
who gives you evolution

01:11:23.747 --> 01:11:29.109
and one who gives you evolution
becomes ultimately 16 petals.

01:11:29.173 --> 01:11:34.163
It starts from the 10 becomes 16
petals and becomes Shri Krishna here.

01:11:36.757 --> 01:11:39.232
Now there are people who
are standing the streets

01:11:39.256 --> 01:11:40.756
singing 'Hare Rama Hare Krishna.'

01:11:40.786 --> 01:11:42.435
I really feel so ashame of them.

01:11:42.961 --> 01:11:50.459
Imagine the people who worship
Krishna as their God should beg.

01:11:50.546 --> 01:11:52.418
It's something I just
can't understand.

01:11:53.443 --> 01:11:55.453
Is impossible for me to see.

01:11:56.414 --> 01:12:02.432
Krishna's friend was a very
poor man called Sudama.

01:12:03.952 --> 01:12:07.317
In childhood they used to study
together in a school of a guru

01:12:08.373 --> 01:12:12.087
and when he became the king
Sudama went to see him

01:12:12.682 --> 01:12:18.952
and he just sent a message that go and tell
Shri Krishna that I'm his friend Sudama.

01:12:19.007 --> 01:12:20.776
So everybody laughed at him.

01:12:21.135 --> 01:12:24.222
But he said no please tell
him, He will recognize me,

01:12:25.079 --> 01:12:30.111
and Sudama didn't know what to take.
So he had taken a little bit of rice,

01:12:30.864 --> 01:12:32.555
a kind of a rice we get,

01:12:33.452 --> 01:12:35.984
pounded rice, with him to
give it to shri Krishna.

01:12:38.286 --> 01:12:41.357
When Shri Krishna heard
that Sudama has come

01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:44.134
He started shouting and roaring,

01:12:44.667 --> 01:12:47.730
so happy and joyous saying, "Oh
my great friend has come."

01:12:48.730 --> 01:12:52.682
He came down from his throne and
he ran to the door and he just

01:12:53.183 --> 01:12:57.630
took him in His heart and said, "Oh
my great friend you have come."

01:12:58.024 --> 01:13:01.388
"I'm so much happy that you have
remembered me and have come."

01:13:01.802 --> 01:13:04.571
He brought him in, made
him sit in His throne.

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:08.326
He was so embarassed. He
you'll sleep on my bed.

01:13:08.358 --> 01:13:10.420
I'm going to sleep near you here.

01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:12.746
He asked his all queens
to look after him,

01:13:12.817 --> 01:13:15.119
all the maids to look after him,

01:13:15.175 --> 01:13:17.960
all the men to give
everything that he wanted.

01:13:18.143 --> 01:13:22.095
Then he dressed him up very well. He said,
"You are my friend. You are my king."

01:13:22.778 --> 01:13:26.642
He took him on his chariot
carried him along.

01:13:27.349 --> 01:13:29.991
and on the chariot they were throwing.

01:13:30.029 --> 01:13:32.641
In their custom in India
is to take the bad eye

01:13:32.775 --> 01:13:35.554
you have to throw some
coins or some pearls.

01:13:35.673 --> 01:13:40.403
They were thowing pearls and
diamonds and rubies on his chariot.

01:13:40.499 --> 01:13:44.959
And Sudama was saying, "Let
one fall into my lap also,"

01:13:46.071 --> 01:13:48.777
in a very sweet way,

01:13:49.516 --> 01:13:55.583
and then Sudama just
came back to his family

01:13:56.165 --> 01:13:58.511
and he found his family was not there.

01:13:58.646 --> 01:14:00.566
He said, "Where is my family gone?"

01:14:00.643 --> 01:14:03.198
They said, "They have moved
to that another house."

01:14:03.238 --> 01:14:08.055
He saw a huge big house made
of gold and beautiful things.

01:14:08.095 --> 01:14:09.512
He said, "This is not my house."

01:14:09.532 --> 01:14:12.055
They said, "This your house
where you have to go."

01:14:12.116 --> 01:14:13.727
So he went there,

01:14:13.775 --> 01:14:17.230
and he saw his wife, his children

01:14:18.230 --> 01:14:22.055
given with all comforts of life,
all the beauties of life.

01:14:22.492 --> 01:14:25.730
Krishna has said,"
Yoga Kshem vahamyam."

01:14:26.167 --> 01:14:30.277
You should come to yoga first,
then I give you the well being.

01:14:30.333 --> 01:14:33.857
First come to you. First
receive your realization.

01:14:33.905 --> 01:14:37.190
First yoga and then
kshema, not kshema yoga.

01:14:38.214 --> 01:14:40.222
Look at that and look at this.

01:14:41.167 --> 01:14:46.332
Any Indian who knows feels
ashamed. But they beg so much.

01:14:46.577 --> 01:14:51.023
You see they go in the South
Hall and beg all the time.

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:53.976
So the Indians are quite rich in England.
They give them money.

01:14:54.106 --> 01:14:56.559
They can't bare to see this
begging in the name of Krishna.

01:14:56.591 --> 01:14:58.455
 Just to get rid of it.

01:14:58.484 --> 01:15:00.722
But every Saturday they are there.

01:15:01.571 --> 01:15:04.166
Because Saturday there is
crowd they are there begging.

01:15:04.587 --> 01:15:08.858
Even on Oxford circus they are
standing there and begging.

01:15:08.874 --> 01:15:10.428
 Such a shameful thing.

01:15:11.206 --> 01:15:16.120
As Krishna's disciple you have to
have self-esteem, self-respect.

01:15:16.168 --> 01:15:18.007
Beggars can not have that.

01:15:18.238 --> 01:15:20.404
Begging is not the way
a yogi should behave.

01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:25.039
He has to have self
respect and self esteem.

01:15:25.102 --> 01:15:27.412
Otherwise who is going
to respect a beggar.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.341
Apart from that when you
go on saying these mantras

01:15:31.667 --> 01:15:36.964
from this throat of yours which
is not been yet initiated,

01:15:37.043 --> 01:15:40.882
in the sense the Kundalini
has not crossed this chakra,

01:15:40.937 --> 01:15:45.834
then you develop troubles of this throat
maybe cancer also of this throat.

01:15:45.873 --> 01:15:49.882
I have got three people coming from there.
They all had cancer of the throat.

01:15:51.722 --> 01:15:53.587
So it is a very wretched condition.

01:15:54.706 --> 01:15:57.793
There is no need for you to say,

01:15:57.817 --> 01:16:00.060
"I should live like this. I
should discipline myself."

01:16:00.092 --> 01:16:03.087
"I should go to that extent
that I just destroy myself."

01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:05.230
It should be in the center.

01:16:05.302 --> 01:16:07.666
You should not do something too much

01:16:07.698 --> 01:16:09.888
to destroy yourself by indulgences

01:16:10.024 --> 01:16:14.752
and you should not do any
kind of a cruelty to youself.

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:16.406
Also that is destruction.

01:16:16.515 --> 01:16:18.525
Try to be in the center.

01:16:18.573 --> 01:16:22.366
Again I say, as Buddha has said,
that you be in the center.

01:16:23.151 --> 01:16:28.452
Now today, I have described to you
all these centers in very short.

01:16:28.944 --> 01:16:31.412
I have given lectures on every center

01:16:31.897 --> 01:16:34.936
and there are thousands
and more lectures

01:16:35.333 --> 01:16:37.706
with the ashram people here.

01:16:38.429 --> 01:16:43.166
When you get your realization
then you can hear them very well

01:16:43.738 --> 01:16:47.059
and you can understand what
I am saying about these

01:16:47.071 --> 01:16:50.515
chakras is true or not, which
you can verify yourself.

01:16:51.198 --> 01:16:55.404
But today in short I have told
you about these three chakras

01:16:55.944 --> 01:17:00.968
and tomorrow I hope to tell you
something about realization,

01:17:01.286 --> 01:17:04.547
spirit, and what after realization.

01:18:24.079 --> 01:18:27.849
Now you why we are putting our
feel on the Mother earth,

01:18:27.856 --> 01:18:30.785
 but keep them separately
because these are two powers.

01:18:30.937 --> 01:18:33.087
So keep them separately.

01:18:34.294 --> 01:18:36.151
Put your left hand towards me

01:18:40.093 --> 01:18:43.759
and the right hand also towards
me, for the time being.

01:18:44.132 --> 01:18:48.227
But then we have use the
right hand for the action

01:18:48.521 --> 01:18:51.243
of raising our kundalini
on the left hand side.

01:18:51.593 --> 01:18:55.219
As I told you the left hand
is the power of desire.

01:18:55.402 --> 01:19:00.560
So first there should be a desire
to ascend, to be the Spirit.

01:19:02.434 --> 01:19:05.910
Put your left hand towards me.
You should not be adament.

01:19:06.029 --> 01:19:09.457
Just let it go. It will
work out for all fo you.

01:19:10.236 --> 01:19:13.830
If it doesn't work out then
there is something wrong.

01:19:13.847 --> 01:19:16.932
Maybe your principle of Guru is wrong,

01:19:16.963 --> 01:19:21.703
or maybe you have got some
problems with your physical side,

01:19:22.093 --> 01:19:24.892
or maybe some emotional
problems are there.

01:19:24.931 --> 01:19:27.885
Anything like that can be corrected.

01:19:27.901 --> 01:19:30.401
Everybody will get realization.

01:19:30.426 --> 01:19:33.746
And nobody should get
anxious about it.

01:19:33.791 --> 01:19:35.477
There should be no anxiety.

01:19:35.493 --> 01:19:39.330
 With all cheerfullness you must
sit with your left hand towards me

01:19:39.386 --> 01:19:43.919
and right hand little easy easy
so we can move it later on.

01:19:43.974 --> 01:19:46.394
But just now put both
the hands on your lap

01:19:47.609 --> 01:19:49.299
and close your eyes.

01:19:50.553 --> 01:19:51.799
Please close your eyes.

01:19:53.675 --> 01:19:56.261
Please take out your malas
and things like that.

01:19:56.378 --> 01:19:58.808
You see that work out.
Vishuddhi it won't work out.

01:19:58.832 --> 01:20:00.435
So please take them out
if you don't mind.

01:20:00.482 --> 01:20:03.275
If you want to have your realization,
please take out your malas.

01:20:04.251 --> 01:20:09.330
Please help yourself a little bit.
Please listen to me take out your malas.

01:20:10.424 --> 01:20:14.560
Because we want to achieve it for you.

01:20:18.004 --> 01:20:22.512
If you have also some neck ties very tight
on your neck you can loosen it a little.

01:20:22.728 --> 01:20:25.909
Or on your neck if you

01:20:26.393 --> 01:20:30.545
have any heavy, very heavy
thing you can remove it.

01:20:30.553 --> 01:20:33.897
Better to remove it, if there
is anything heavy on your neck.

01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:39.774
Or on your waiste there
is anyting very tight

01:20:39.838 --> 01:20:44.337
better to remove anything
heavy on your neck or on your

01:20:46.155 --> 01:20:48.829
Yes, if there is anything that
is tight better to remove.

01:20:49.708 --> 01:20:50.828
It's better.

01:21:02.176 --> 01:21:04.557
Just put your right hand.

01:21:06.073 --> 01:21:07.648
Close your eyes please first.

01:21:07.711 --> 01:21:11.481
Now don't open your eyes at
any time till I tell you,

01:21:11.521 --> 01:21:13.938
because the Kundalini won't rise

01:21:13.970 --> 01:21:17.986
up to after agnya if
you open your eyes.

01:21:31.867 --> 01:21:35.022
You'll feel a cool breeze
in your hand first of all

01:21:35.029 --> 01:21:38.359
or maybe on top of your
head as we go through

01:21:38.445 --> 01:21:42.015
various levels of our chakras.

01:21:42.653 --> 01:21:47.089
So first of all you put your
right hand on your heart

01:21:49.486 --> 01:21:51.843
and just say,

01:21:55.613 --> 01:21:59.033
Mother I am the Spirit.

01:22:20.065 --> 01:22:24.978
Now put this right hand down on
your stomach on the left hand side

01:22:29.692 --> 01:22:35.138
and say, Mother I am my own guru.

01:22:35.146 --> 01:22:37.986
With all confidence, I am my own guru.

01:22:48.176 --> 01:22:50.120
I am my own master.

01:22:52.613 --> 01:22:56.605
You have to say it ten times, as I
told you there are ten plexuses.

01:22:58.208 --> 01:23:02.660
I am my own guru. That's how you
will neutralize all the bad effects

01:23:03.168 --> 01:23:06.255
and your principle of guru,

01:23:07.010 --> 01:23:09.011
principle of master.

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:12.383
You must shine.

01:23:37.106 --> 01:23:39.510
Now again put the right hand.

01:23:39.535 --> 01:23:42.415
Left hand towards me.
Keep it steady toward Me.

01:23:43.352 --> 01:23:45.444
Your fingers towards me, left hand.

01:23:45.475 --> 01:23:48.388
Please keep it on your lap.
Left hand towards me.

01:23:48.557 --> 01:23:51.709
Now put the right hand
again on the heart

01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:57.701
and say Mother I am the Spiriti.

01:23:58.796 --> 01:24:02.867
With confidence. Now you
have to say it 12 times.

01:24:04.138 --> 01:24:06.153
Because there are 12 petals.

01:24:27.606 --> 01:24:29.828
Now put this right hand

01:24:30.082 --> 01:24:33.082
on your neck on the left hand side

01:24:35.796 --> 01:24:39.534
at this point you have to
say Mother I am not guilty.

01:24:39.773 --> 01:24:43.375
What ever you have done at this moment

01:24:44.225 --> 01:24:45.345
is all finished.

01:24:46.955 --> 01:24:49.010
You are going to be reborn.

01:24:50.582 --> 01:24:53.661
Like an egg may have
any number of specks,

01:24:53.693 --> 01:24:57.304
but a bird doesn't show that.
In the same way

01:24:58.527 --> 01:25:03.218
you should say, Mother
I am not guilty.

01:25:04.947 --> 01:25:06.471
If you are the Spirit,

01:25:07.479 --> 01:25:10.240
the Spirit can not get any blemish.

01:25:13.876 --> 01:25:16.042
16 times we say.

01:25:36.958 --> 01:25:40.912
Believe me that you can
not comit any guilt

01:25:40.922 --> 01:25:43.890
which can not be washed
by the grace of God.

01:25:53.349 --> 01:25:57.952
Now raise the same right hand,
keeping the left hand towards me.

01:25:58.260 --> 01:26:00.513
On your forehead across

01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:03.507
touch your forehead across

01:26:05.404 --> 01:26:06.793
and say now,

01:26:07.396 --> 01:26:10.340
Mother I forgive everyone.

01:26:10.952 --> 01:26:12.072
It's not difficult.

01:26:12.754 --> 01:26:14.888
If you understand that it is a myth,

01:26:16.261 --> 01:26:19.197
that you do not forgive.
Actually you don't do anything.

01:26:19.230 --> 01:26:22.118
Like that only thing you are
torturing yourself by not forgiving.

01:26:23.039 --> 01:26:24.586
So just say Mother

01:26:26.262 --> 01:26:28.388
I forgive everyone.

01:26:32.014 --> 01:26:36.340
Because this is the center of christ
say, Mother I forgive everyone.

01:26:43.222 --> 01:26:46.904
There is no need to see other people,
just now you have to see yourself.

01:26:47.571 --> 01:26:51.118
You have seen all of them
before, better see yourself.

01:26:51.643 --> 01:26:53.959
So put your right hand
across your head.

01:26:56.896 --> 01:26:59.555
Better get it. It's a
very great chance.

01:27:02.595 --> 01:27:05.888
And now put your hand
on top of your head.

01:27:10.087 --> 01:27:11.891
On top of your head

01:27:12.479 --> 01:27:17.707
where you had a soft bone, the
area, fontenlle bone area.

01:27:18.295 --> 01:27:22.298
Put your left hand towards Me. Left
hand should be down below towards Me.

01:27:22.445 --> 01:27:24.251
On top of your head,

01:27:24.521 --> 01:27:26.044
in the center of your head,

01:27:26.315 --> 01:27:29.386
just press it, with the palm of your hand.

01:27:34.069 --> 01:27:36.203
Now raise your hand above

01:27:37.227 --> 01:27:38.347
4 inches

01:27:39.354 --> 01:27:40.790
and say that

01:27:41.775 --> 01:27:45.787
you want your realization because
you are free not to have it.

01:27:46.033 --> 01:27:47.557
I can not force you.

01:27:48.438 --> 01:27:52.184
So just say Mother I
want my realization

01:27:52.811 --> 01:27:55.509
or please give me realization Mother.

01:28:02.319 --> 01:28:04.160
Now you can change your hand.

01:28:04.208 --> 01:28:07.747
Put your right hand down
and left hand up and see,

01:28:12.462 --> 01:28:14.374
if there is a cool breeze coming in.

01:28:29.557 --> 01:28:32.795
You can change again and see if
there is a cool breeze coming in.

01:28:33.073 --> 01:28:36.668
Some people might be getting little hot.
Doesn't matter.

01:28:37.414 --> 01:28:39.080
Raise your hand higher.

01:28:39.199 --> 01:28:43.128
On your head move it and see if there is
a cool breeze coming in, not very high

01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:46.120
see about 6-7 inches.

01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:51.063
That's the wind of the Holy Ghost.

01:28:56.184 --> 01:29:00.225
Now ask a question by
putting up both your hands,

01:29:00.531 --> 01:29:02.729
up there facing Me

01:29:03.517 --> 01:29:06.544
both the hands up in the air

01:29:06.697 --> 01:29:10.852
and ask the question Mother is
this the wind of the Holy Ghost?

01:29:29.332 --> 01:29:31.030
Now bring down your hands

01:29:31.753 --> 01:29:34.720
and see you are feeling any
cool breeze in your hands.

01:29:53.260 --> 01:30:00.823
It's all right. We'll balance it. I know
left is less all right. Now it's better.

01:30:04.173 --> 01:30:06.561
You may gradually open your eyes now.

01:30:09.768 --> 01:30:12.899
Also Mr Warren will show you

01:30:12.963 --> 01:30:16.645
Dr. Warren will show you how
to raise your own Kundalini.

01:30:24.198 --> 01:30:24.817
Just follow him.

01:30:54.306 --> 01:30:55.797
Push back your hands.

01:31:13.456 --> 01:31:14.576
Push back your hands.

01:31:21.652 --> 01:31:22.953
Now three times knots.

01:31:24.666 --> 01:31:27.904
Don't have to take down the
hands, now come along.

01:31:46.874 --> 01:31:47.994
Now see.

01:31:51.659 --> 01:31:52.779
All right?

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.120
It's very subtle.

01:31:56.490 --> 01:31:59.815
We are going from gross
attention to subtler attention.

01:32:07.335 --> 01:32:10.660
You are absolutely thoughtless.
There is no thought in your mind.

01:32:14.829 --> 01:32:19.701
Those who have felt the cool breeze
please raise your hands, all of you.

01:32:23.559 --> 01:32:27.122
Those who have felt the cool
breeze raise your hands please.

01:32:27.942 --> 01:32:28.259
Both hands

01:32:30.311 --> 01:32:31.431
Those who have felt it.

01:32:32.631 --> 01:32:35.433
It's all right, if you have
felt it better rasie it.

01:32:37.332 --> 01:32:38.452
It's good.

01:32:39.269 --> 01:32:41.292
Quite alot of them have felt it.

01:32:43.011 --> 01:32:45.058
Now what we have to do

01:32:45.676 --> 01:32:48.811
is tomorrow is the last day,

01:32:48.898 --> 01:32:51.596
and I will explain to you

01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:55.113
last center which is very important

01:32:56.056 --> 01:32:59.088
and how to keep your realization.

01:33:03.307 --> 01:33:07.378
First of all you can't think about it.
It is beyond thought.

01:33:07.911 --> 01:33:09.831
So you don't discuss it.

01:33:11.245 --> 01:33:12.924
That is definate.

01:33:12.988 --> 01:33:15.885
Then it is a very delicate thing.

01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:18.431
Just now is just the premule.

01:33:19.757 --> 01:33:23.027
The germ has touched it.

01:33:23.076 --> 01:33:28.198
It's a very thin line which
passes through the Brahma nadi.

01:33:28.230 --> 01:33:31.313
The whole kundalini is like a
rope with many, many threads

01:33:31.639 --> 01:33:33.925
and one thread has touched it.

01:33:34.799 --> 01:33:38.544
So you have to learn
how to keep it there.

01:33:38.719 --> 01:33:40.536
How to maintain it there,

01:33:40.674 --> 01:33:44.006
and use it for your own ascent,

01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:48.099
for repairs of your
self to begin with,

01:33:48.279 --> 01:33:50.850
and then how to go to the collective,

01:33:51.438 --> 01:33:53.699
how to help the others.

01:33:54.087 --> 01:33:57.126
So first of all one has
to be very careful.

01:33:57.724 --> 01:34:01.620
Tomorrow I will be able to tell
you about self realization.

01:34:01.692 --> 01:34:05.684
how to continue with and what
powers you have got now.

01:34:06.002 --> 01:34:09.731
Because you have felt the cool breeze but
you don't know what powers you have got.

01:34:09.829 --> 01:34:14.444
So tomorrow I will be able to tell you
exactly what powers you have got already

01:34:14.746 --> 01:34:15.866
and how to use them.

01:34:16.952 --> 01:34:18.072
May God bless you.
