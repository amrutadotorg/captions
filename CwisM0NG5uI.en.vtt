00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:08.829
Today you have come here to worship me
as Shri Ganesha.

00:00:09.486 --> 00:00:17.334
We have been singing the praise
of Shri Ganesha before every puja.

00:00:18.094 --> 00:00:26.752
And we have such tremendous respect
for Shri Ganesh

00:00:26.953 --> 00:00:32.245
because we have found out that unless
and until Shri Ganesha,

00:00:32.446 --> 00:00:39.612
who is the symbol of our innocence,
is not awakened within us,

00:00:39.813 --> 00:00:46.733
we cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:00:46.934 --> 00:00:53.506
And even to stay there and to enjoy
the blessings of Shri Ganesha,

00:00:53.707 --> 00:01:02.036
we have to have our innocence fully
blossoming.

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:11.189
So we praise Him and He is very easily
praised.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.829
And whatever we might have done wrong
before coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.346
He completely forgives

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:27.372
because He is the eternal child.

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.551
You have seen children,

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.321
when you slap them, sometimes get angry
with them,

00:01:37.544 --> 00:01:43.739
they forget it. They only remember
the love

00:01:45.818 --> 00:01:52.950
and not what they have suffered
at your hands.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:02.462
Till they grow up, they do not have memory
of bad things done to them.

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:06.492
From the very beginning,

00:02:07.638 --> 00:02:11.629
a child is born to a mother,

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:15.514
he doesn’t know what he has gone through.

00:02:15.715 --> 00:02:20.309
Then gradually the memory starts working

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.039
and he starts restoring things within
himself.

00:02:25.904 --> 00:02:32.518
But in the beginning, only he remembers
what nice things have happened to him.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:38.565
So we always like to ponder about
our childhood,

00:02:38.766 --> 00:02:42.427
what we enjoyed in our childhood.

00:02:42.628 --> 00:02:48.194
But as we start growing up, we start
remembering all the miseries

00:02:48.395 --> 00:02:54.806
and all the tribulations we had to go
through.

00:02:55.007 --> 00:03:01.693
All the ordeals, through which we have
passed, we try to magnify it.

00:03:01.894 --> 00:03:05.764
In childhood, the children only remember
the people who have loved them

00:03:05.965 --> 00:03:11.209
and not the people who have hurt them.
They don’t want to remember perhaps.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.953
It looks like that. But when they grow up,

00:03:19.051 --> 00:03:25.361
they only try to remember those people
who have harmed them or have troubled them

00:03:25.576 --> 00:03:29.824
and that’s how they make themselves
very miserable.

00:03:30.844 --> 00:03:38.949
But the principle of Ganesha is extremely
subtle, is the subtlest of subtle.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:47.878
And it exists in everything, that it exists
in the matter, in the form of vibrations.

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:52.782
There is no matter, which is without
vibrations.

00:03:52.983 --> 00:04:01.872
It has vibrations, which are seen even
in the atoms

00:04:02.073 --> 00:04:08.650
and also in the molecules of all matter
that is existing.

00:04:08.851 --> 00:04:15.244
So Shri Ganesha is the first one who
was established in the matter, as well.

00:04:15.445 --> 00:04:18.942
As a result, we can see, He exists
in the sun,

00:04:19.143 --> 00:04:22.038
He exists in the moon, He exists
in the whole universe,

00:04:22.239 --> 00:04:28.146
in the whole creation, and He continues
to exist in human beings also.

00:04:28.347 --> 00:04:31.694
Only the human beings have capacity

00:04:31.895 --> 00:04:38.030
to somehow or other cover up your –
the innocence.

00:04:38.231 --> 00:04:43.869
Otherwise, animals are innocent.

00:04:44.342 --> 00:04:48.345
Human beings have the freedom; if they
want, they can cover up

00:04:48.546 --> 00:04:54.231
their innocence, they can shut down
the doors of Shri Ganesha

00:04:54.432 --> 00:04:59.049
and say that He does not exist. They can
cloud it.

00:04:59.401 --> 00:05:02.593
And that is why we find among human
beings,

00:05:02.794 --> 00:05:06.704
that they are doing so many horrible
things,

00:05:06.905 --> 00:05:11.486
avoiding the existence of Shri Ganesh.

00:05:11.687 --> 00:05:17.615
But He acts. He acts in a way

00:05:18.075 --> 00:05:23.379
that He shows natural results of our
wrongdoings.

00:05:25.564 --> 00:05:35.335
Like if you do things, which are not
pleasing to Shri Ganesh,

00:05:35.536 --> 00:05:39.214
He goes up to a point, forgives you up
to a point,

00:05:39.415 --> 00:05:46.699
and then He starts emerging out
as diseases, as physical diseases,

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.230
and in women, it becomes a mental disease.

00:05:51.431 --> 00:05:58.360
Also, it can create problems in the nature.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.823
The natural catastrophes are, also,

00:06:05.291 --> 00:06:09.017
only the curse of Shri Ganesha.

00:06:09.218 --> 00:06:13.655
When people start doing wrong things,

00:06:14.428 --> 00:06:19.388
behaving in a wrong manner, collectively,

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:24.625
then the natural catastrophes come
to teach them a lesson.

00:06:24.826 --> 00:06:29.461
So in His essence, though He exists
in everything,

00:06:29.662 --> 00:06:38.286
also in that, He has capacity to assert
His will,

00:06:38.487 --> 00:06:43.035
to bring forth the destruction of the whole
world.

00:06:43.748 --> 00:06:49.905
We have Shri Ganesha’s idea as
a minute thing.

00:06:50.106 --> 00:06:55.664
We think, He can go on a little mouse,
so He must be very minute.

00:06:55.865 --> 00:06:59.590
He is as minute as He is great.

00:06:59.791 --> 00:07:06.691
He surpasses all the Deities because
of His wisdom.

00:07:06.892 --> 00:07:12.225
He is the giver of wisdom. He gives
us wisdom. He makes us learn.

00:07:12.426 --> 00:07:15.593
He is our Guru, in that respect, Mahaguru,

00:07:15.794 --> 00:07:19.099
because He teaches us how we should
behave.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:24.356
If you try to surpass Him and try
to misbehave,

00:07:24.557 --> 00:07:28.332
even the Mother won’t support you,

00:07:28.533 --> 00:07:34.123
because She knows, that those who surpass
Shri Ganesha

00:07:34.324 --> 00:07:38.827
are also the people who will never respect
the Mother.

00:07:39.028 --> 00:07:44.863
So He is the epitome of respect for Mother.
Epitome.

00:07:45.064 --> 00:07:48.299
He does not know any other gods. He does
not know Sadashiva.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.475
He doesn’t know anybody else, but He only
respects the Mother.

00:07:52.676 --> 00:07:59.869
So He is the one who is the power of
devotion and complete surrender to Mother,

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:04.860
and that’s why He is the most powerful
Deity among all the Deities

00:08:05.061 --> 00:08:10.181
and nobody can surpass Him in His powers.

00:08:11.404 --> 00:08:16.084
We have to understand that as children
are growing,

00:08:16.285 --> 00:08:21.741
Shri Ganesha starts growing in them also,

00:08:21.942 --> 00:08:26.490
but as they are human beings they can,
somehow or other, try

00:08:26.691 --> 00:08:33.125
to overpower Shri Ganesha. So is the duty
of parents who are sahaja yogis to see

00:08:33.326 --> 00:08:37.848
that they look after their children
in a way, in a detached way,

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:41.246
to see that Shri Ganesha in them
is settled.

00:08:41.447 --> 00:08:45.758
The first sign of Shri Ganesha in a child
is wisdom.

00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:52.641
If the child is not wise, if he is
troublesome,

00:08:52.842 --> 00:08:57.757
if he does not know how to behave, then
that shows that the Shri Ganesha

00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:01.319
is being attacked by him.

00:09:02.308 --> 00:09:07.673
And these days in the modern times, as
it is, children are very much under attack.

00:09:07.874 --> 00:09:09.805
Innocence is under attack.

00:09:10.006 --> 00:09:13.727
And it is very difficult for people to make
a fine line

00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:19.116
as to how far to go with children and
how far not to go.

00:09:19.317 --> 00:09:26.106
Today’s lecture would be more concerning
about how far to go with Shri Ganesha

00:09:26.307 --> 00:09:32.503
as far as children are concerned because
that’s a very important point.

00:09:33.608 --> 00:09:39.210
Because He is the giver of wisdom.
So the parents must understand

00:09:39.411 --> 00:09:45.143
that, “If He is the giver of wisdom, there
should be wisdom, wisdom within me.

00:09:45.344 --> 00:09:49.545
And if I have the wisdom, then I have
the balance,

00:09:49.746 --> 00:09:52.279
and I don’t lose tempers with children,

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:58.893
but I try to correct them, but in such
a manner that they get corrected.”

00:09:59.094 --> 00:10:04.235
On the contrary, if you try to be very
harsh with your children,

00:10:04.436 --> 00:10:08.403
they might react and they might go astray.

00:10:08.604 --> 00:10:10.715
Or you try to restrict them too much,

00:10:10.916 --> 00:10:13.601
then also they will behave in the same
manner.

00:10:13.802 --> 00:10:17.963
So one thing is to be taught to your
own children,

00:10:18.164 --> 00:10:23.103
as Shri Ganesha Himself does, that
“respect your Mother.”

00:10:23.684 --> 00:10:27.861
Your Mother means your Holy Mother
and your own mother.

00:10:28.062 --> 00:10:34.393
That is very important. If the father
doesn’t make the child respect the mother,

00:10:34.594 --> 00:10:37.120
the child can never be all right.

00:10:37.321 --> 00:10:42.692
Because the authority comes from the father
no doubt, but mother must be respected.

00:10:42.893 --> 00:10:48.838
But for that, it is very important that
mother must respect the father.

00:10:49.039 --> 00:10:52.487
So in the presence of children, if you
start fighting with each other,

00:10:52.688 --> 00:10:57.853
misbehaving, and talking in a manner
that is not proper,

00:10:58.054 --> 00:11:04.085
also will have a very bad effect on
the Ganesha Tattwa of the child.

00:11:05.844 --> 00:11:09.388
This upbringing is a very important thing
in Sahaja Yoga

00:11:09.589 --> 00:11:13.603
because by God’s grace you all have got
realised children.

00:11:13.804 --> 00:11:17.047
So you must know how far to go
with your children

00:11:17.248 --> 00:11:22.903
to make them wiser, to be moral, to be
righteous.

00:11:23.104 --> 00:11:27.145
First thing is that you should try
to preserve their wisdom.

00:11:27.346 --> 00:11:31.190
If they say something wise, you must
appreciate.

00:11:31.391 --> 00:11:35.820
But they should not also say out of place,
out of grace.

00:11:36.021 --> 00:11:40.715
So the misbehaviour is also not to be
tolerated, in the sense,

00:11:40.916 --> 00:11:46.770
that whatever is wisdom within, has to be
expressed outside as light.

00:11:47.208 --> 00:11:52.915
Now we go further with it to see how far
Shri Ganesha acts.

00:11:53.227 --> 00:11:58.531
As I said, in the subtlest of subtlest He
exists, but you have to awaken Him.

00:11:58.732 --> 00:12:03.272
For example, you have seen the water,
which is vibrated – means what?

00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:11.159
Vibrated means the Ganesha Tattwa is been
enlightened in that water.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:16.874
So when that water goes into your stomach,
or into your eyes,

00:12:17.075 --> 00:12:21.778
or wherever you want to put it, it acts;
acts in a way

00:12:21.979 --> 00:12:30.019
that it excites the Shri Ganesha Tattwa
into anything that you put it.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:34.598
Now you have seen, we have got miracles
of agriculture, to begin with.

00:12:34.799 --> 00:12:40.496
Miracles of agriculture is such that people
are amazed,

00:12:40.697 --> 00:12:47.444
but it’s very simple. Once you start
exciting the Ganesh Principle

00:12:47.645 --> 00:12:56.133
into the seed, it becomes ten times,
sometimes hundred times.

00:12:56.334 --> 00:13:00.735
Even the Mother Earth, which we think
to be something dead,

00:13:00.936 --> 00:13:06.137
can be vibrated.

00:13:06.338 --> 00:13:13.183
Supposing, you sahaja yogis walk
bare feet on the ground,

00:13:13.421 --> 00:13:16.226
the Mother Earth gets vibrated.

00:13:16.427 --> 00:13:23.769
Such Mother Earth will act on the trees,
on the grass, on the flowers, on everything.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:28.315
As it is, the sahaja yogis have been
telling me that in their ashrams

00:13:28.516 --> 00:13:32.634
all the flowers that grow, are out of size
and very fragrant.

00:13:32.835 --> 00:13:38.207
Like daisies never had fragrance in London
or in England, never.

00:13:38.408 --> 00:13:41.980
Now, the daisy size was so small;
it has become so big,

00:13:42.181 --> 00:13:46.679
and you see them everywhere, so fragrant.
And it is a miracle; the first time

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:51.020
when I told somebody that the daisies
are fragrant, they couldn’t believe it.

00:13:51.221 --> 00:13:54.043
And when they saw the fragrance;
they were surprised.

00:13:54.244 --> 00:14:01.283
In the same way, Ganesha Tattwa
understands, thinks, organises, works out

00:14:01.942 --> 00:14:06.061
if it is awakened. If it is not, it is
sleeping, then it does not.

00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:08.542
So it acts, it works out.

00:14:08.743 --> 00:14:13.856
Like a little seed when it sprouts,
at the tip of the seed,

00:14:14.057 --> 00:14:20.082
there is a little cell, which has got
the Ganesh Tattwa, which is been awakened.

00:14:20.283 --> 00:14:23.713
So it knows how to go down, how to go
around a stone,

00:14:23.914 --> 00:14:29.069
and how to embed itself, and how to reach
the source of water.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:36.122
But it has only the sense how far to go to
exist, how far to go to nourish yourself,

00:14:36.323 --> 00:14:42.199
on a very material plane, how to allow
the tree to grow.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:49.074
But this Ganesh Tattwa starts becoming
very, very subtle and subtlest

00:14:49.308 --> 00:14:52.274
at the point of Agnya chakra.

00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:55.941
At the time of Agnya chakra, it understands

00:14:56.142 --> 00:15:01.787
that it has now the spiritual dimension.

00:15:01.988 --> 00:15:07.238
The same Ganesha Tattwa, which acted
in a small little tip of a root,

00:15:07.439 --> 00:15:10.629
now acts for the spiritual thing.

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:13.740
That’s why people close their eyes
when they meditate –

00:15:13.941 --> 00:15:17.917
because they don’t want to see anything
else, but they want Shri Ganesha just

00:15:18.118 --> 00:15:24.732
to act for the meditative process
of their Kundalini.

00:15:25.795 --> 00:15:32.822
This process of meditation, when we close
our eyes, acts,

00:15:33.023 --> 00:15:36.056
but if you see, if somebody is sleeping
and he is dreaming,

00:15:36.257 --> 00:15:39.145
you will see, there will be, the eyes
will be all the time moving,

00:15:39.346 --> 00:15:42.318
they will be moving eyes.

00:15:43.751 --> 00:15:48.583
This Ganesh Tattwa is now acted
by your attention.

00:15:48.784 --> 00:15:52.794
If you have an attention, which is all the
time going from this place to that place,

00:15:52.995 --> 00:15:56.804
to that place, to that place, then it is
affected,

00:15:57.005 --> 00:16:03.229
specially in the case when we start looking
at men, looking at women, all the time.

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:10.067
Then the – also our Ganesha Tattwa gets
very much destroyed.

00:16:10.268 --> 00:16:16.244
Such people are difficult for rising
in their ascent

00:16:16.445 --> 00:16:19.973
because Agnya itself goes out.

00:16:20.174 --> 00:16:25.014
Then this Ganesha Tattwa can also be
reduced if you are very materialistic,

00:16:25.215 --> 00:16:28.741
always worried about your things... like

00:16:28.942 --> 00:16:32.977
you have something in the house you are
worried about, and looking at everything,

00:16:33.178 --> 00:16:39.178
all the time trying to correct it and all
the time worried about the matter.

00:16:39.379 --> 00:16:42.358
Then also, this Ganesha Tattwa can be lost

00:16:42.559 --> 00:16:45.571
because you are all the time worried
about these things.

00:16:45.772 --> 00:16:49.446
Like we are going to the shop and we are
seeing everything,

00:16:49.647 --> 00:16:52.688
“What is there? What is there? What
should I buy? What should I buy?”

00:16:52.889 --> 00:16:55.316
Like that also if you do too much,
it will be.

00:16:55.517 --> 00:17:00.225
But supposing you are buying something
out of beauty, for beauty.

00:17:00.426 --> 00:17:02.942
You want to buy something for beautifying
your house.

00:17:03.143 --> 00:17:07.410
That means, you are trying to do something
to please others.

00:17:07.611 --> 00:17:11.759
You are doing it to make others very happy.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:20.595
Then, it acts the other way round,
then it increases your ascent.

00:17:20.796 --> 00:17:27.199
But if it is done only to create a kind
of a joy for others,

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:34.489
sharing of the beauty of whatever you
have bought or you have taken.

00:17:35.643 --> 00:17:41.756
But supposing, you are buying anything
for making others feel jealous –

00:17:41.957 --> 00:17:47.482
that also I’ve recently learned, that
there is a capacity like that for people

00:17:47.683 --> 00:17:53.914
to buy something to make others jealous,
not to make somebody feel happy.

00:17:54.115 --> 00:17:57.964
If there are people who buy things just
to make others feel jealous,

00:17:58.165 --> 00:18:02.908
then also their Ganesha Tattwa can be
destroyed.

00:18:03.109 --> 00:18:07.269
What you should buy? Anything,
you should make a beautiful house.

00:18:07.539 --> 00:18:09.259
When somebody comes to your house,

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:12.366
you should say, “Oh, what a nice thing
we have seen.”

00:18:12.567 --> 00:18:17.139
Not attachment to the thing, but attachment
to the thing how people feel,

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:20.521
how they feel nice and relaxed, and

00:18:20.722 --> 00:18:26.095
they feel their Shri Ganesha within
them, which is beauty.

00:18:26.296 --> 00:18:30.607
When this feeling comes in, then we
should say there is Ganesh Tattwa.

00:18:30.808 --> 00:18:34.926
And is a very motherly feeling it is.
Like a mother always wants to give

00:18:35.127 --> 00:18:38.819
sweet things to her children, beautiful
things to her children.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:43.399
In the same way, in that you have
that vatsalya, as is called,

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:48.564
is the feeling of the mother for the child.
That subtle feeling you have that,

00:18:48.765 --> 00:18:51.865
“People have come to my house. Now see
how they are happy,

00:18:52.081 --> 00:18:56.564
they are enjoying this and they are
appreciating it.”

00:18:57.509 --> 00:19:01.760
In that way, you also satisfy a very great
Ganesha Principle,

00:19:01.961 --> 00:19:07.345
is that you have taken note of the artists.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:14.656
Though the artists are creating their
all beautiful things out of matter

00:19:14.857 --> 00:19:19.255
through the Swadisthana, but without
Swadisthana being governed

00:19:19.456 --> 00:19:22.890
by Shri Ganesha, it cannot be beautiful.

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:27.263
These days, as you see, the artists
are taking to all sorts

00:19:27.464 --> 00:19:30.345
of grotesque things and very immoral
things.

00:19:30.546 --> 00:19:33.716
And these things are of no eternal value.

00:19:33.917 --> 00:19:37.415
Today people will buy them and tomorrow
they will throw away.

00:19:37.616 --> 00:19:42.383
Only the things, which have got the subtle
Ganesh Principle in it acting,

00:19:42.584 --> 00:19:49.734
which makes you soothe down, which
makes you feel peaceful,

00:19:49.935 --> 00:19:55.915
which makes you feel happy, is the one
that is appreciated.

00:19:56.116 --> 00:20:02.059
So Shri Ganesha establishes within you
the higher Self.

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:07.416
So the baser self, which enjoys all baser
things of lives,

00:20:07.617 --> 00:20:10.342
are being curtailed down,

00:20:10.543 --> 00:20:15.551
being cut down, sometimes completely
destroyed by Shri Ganesha.

00:20:15.752 --> 00:20:18.825
I’ll give you an example of Mona Lisa.
If you see Mona Lisa –

00:20:19.026 --> 00:20:21.778
I mean I don’t know, she cannot be
an actress,

00:20:21.979 --> 00:20:25.563
she cannot win any beauty contest,
I think.

00:20:25.764 --> 00:20:33.294
She… her face is very serene, very
motherly, very pure, her eyes.

00:20:33.495 --> 00:20:37.646
And why is it that she’s eternally
so much appreciated?

00:20:37.847 --> 00:20:41.643
The reason is, there is Ganesha Principle
in her. She’s a mother.

00:20:41.844 --> 00:20:46.952
And the story about that one is that
this lady had lost her child

00:20:47.153 --> 00:20:49.583
and she would never smile, she would
never cry.

00:20:49.784 --> 00:20:53.930
And one little child was brought to her,
and when she saw the child,

00:20:54.131 --> 00:20:58.467
then the smile that came on her face
of that love for the child,

00:20:58.668 --> 00:21:01.517
is been depicted by this great artist.

00:21:01.718 --> 00:21:05.139
And that’s why people are appreciating it.
And you have seen in the West,

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:11.330
though the people don’t show much interest
in the mother-child relationships,

00:21:11.531 --> 00:21:15.757
anywhere you go, is the mother and child
theme is the best.

00:21:15.958 --> 00:21:18.416
They’ll show you a photograph, “This is
mother and child,

00:21:18.617 --> 00:21:20.232
this is Christ’s Mother and Child.

00:21:20.433 --> 00:21:22.649
When the Christ was brought down,
the Mother is there,”

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:26.153
They have to have Mother and the Child
Principle acting,

00:21:26.354 --> 00:21:30.441
otherwise, that picture is not regarded
as something great.

00:21:30.642 --> 00:21:36.907
Or you have to have, actually, Christ who
is a Ganesha Principle Himself to be shown.

00:21:37.108 --> 00:21:42.061
I haven’t seen any picture as such
of those days

00:21:42.262 --> 00:21:46.136
where these principles are not there.
Even Picasso has used it.

00:21:46.337 --> 00:21:50.416
Even people who have been quite modern,
had to use this principle

00:21:50.617 --> 00:21:54.999
to popularise. But some people have used
to popularise,

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:59.537
not the Ganesh Principle, just anti-Ganesh
principles.

00:21:59.738 --> 00:22:04.029
All such things have vanished into
thin air, and I see now, gradually,

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:07.558
it’s all going down and down and down
and down.

00:22:07.759 --> 00:22:11.627
Despite the fact, people have lost
their morals, but still,

00:22:11.828 --> 00:22:15.910
they would like to have Rembrandt,
they’d like to have Leonardo da Vinci,

00:22:16.111 --> 00:22:21.466
they would like to have such artists,
who have done Mother and Child.

00:22:21.667 --> 00:22:26.359
Is very surprising. Even I went to Austria
this time, I said,

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:31.661
“What statues you have?” Said, “We have
got beautiful Madonna and the Child.”

00:22:32.216 --> 00:22:36.296
So this principle is the most pleasing
principle.

00:22:36.995 --> 00:22:40.411
Is the most pleasing principle for human
beings

00:22:40.612 --> 00:22:44.821
to see the children, to play with them,
to enjoy their company.

00:22:45.022 --> 00:22:49.413
Why? Because it has that sweetness
of a child.

00:22:49.614 --> 00:22:53.727
It’s really, I should say, tickles joy
within you when you see a child.

00:22:53.928 --> 00:22:56.799
Immediately the face becomes different.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.084
I have told you that I’ve seen even
a crocodile cracking her eggs.

00:23:02.285 --> 00:23:03.908
I mean, they showed it in a film,

00:23:04.109 --> 00:23:07.960
and you should have seen the eyes
of the crocodile at that time,

00:23:08.161 --> 00:23:13.262
how carefully she was cracking.
So beautiful her eyes were,

00:23:13.463 --> 00:23:17.329
full of – such love pouring out
of her eyes.

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:22.036
And you can’t believe, these are the eyes
of the same crocodile.

00:23:22.743 --> 00:23:26.940
And so slowly she’s cracking with her mouth
all the eggs

00:23:27.141 --> 00:23:32.106
and the little, little crocodiles coming
out. And then she brings them on the shore

00:23:32.307 --> 00:23:35.449
and washes them in the mouth all the time,

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:41.701
so carefully, like a bathroom, she uses
her mouth, you see.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:46.715
You should see how animals also act
to their children.

00:23:46.916 --> 00:23:51.172
But when you become sort of modern,
so-called,

00:23:51.373 --> 00:23:56.026
your actions are very funny. There are
people who are killing children,

00:23:56.227 --> 00:24:01.129
there are people who are abusing children.
I mean, it is worse than rakshasas.

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:06.863
Even rakshasas have not done, pishakshas
have not done. The Ganas are surprised –

00:24:07.064 --> 00:24:10.561
“What sort of these new creatures
have come up from where,

00:24:10.762 --> 00:24:14.840
that they have no love for their children,
that they can kill their children,

00:24:15.041 --> 00:24:19.459
murder them, break their hands. These are
their own children.

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:23.832
If they do this to their own children,
what will they do to other’s children?”

00:24:24.033 --> 00:24:28.679
So love for your child has to be absolutely
important,

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.776
but you should not as sahaja yogis

00:24:31.977 --> 00:24:36.406
have only attachment for your child,
first thing.

00:24:36.607 --> 00:24:40.873
And the second thing is, you must know
how to give

00:24:41.074 --> 00:24:46.736
a complete margin to your love. The margin
is benevolence:

00:24:46.937 --> 00:24:50.945
“Is it benevolent for my child?
Am I spoiling my child?

00:24:51.146 --> 00:24:56.250
Am I too much encouraging my child?
Am I playing into the hands of my child?

00:24:56.451 --> 00:24:59.508
Or I am managing the child alright?”

00:24:59.709 --> 00:25:03.775
Because in childhood, the father and
mother have to manage the children.

00:25:03.976 --> 00:25:06.695
They have to tell children and children
have to be obedient

00:25:06.896 --> 00:25:11.074
and they have to listen to parents. But
these days children are not obedient.

00:25:11.275 --> 00:25:15.703
They are not because there is – they find
that the parents among themselves

00:25:15.904 --> 00:25:17.862
are not obedient to each other.

00:25:18.063 --> 00:25:22.684
Also, they find the society is such, that
where children go on

00:25:22.885 --> 00:25:26.676
pestering the parents so they also become
like that. But doesn’t matter,

00:25:26.877 --> 00:25:30.975
you are sahaja yogis, so you should bring
up your children, who should be obedient,

00:25:31.176 --> 00:25:33.767
who should be wise, who should be sensible,

00:25:33.968 --> 00:25:40.325
with the same love that the crocodile has
for her little crocodiles.

00:25:42.313 --> 00:25:46.771
Now, when we come to the subtler side
of Ganesha Tattwa,

00:25:46.972 --> 00:25:50.383
that is, it expresses in our eyes.

00:25:51.071 --> 00:25:54.328
When I see some things,

00:25:55.030 --> 00:26:00.394
I see it as a joy-giving thing,
just joy-giving.

00:26:00.595 --> 00:26:04.795
And if I want to buy something, then
I think, “Alright,

00:26:04.996 --> 00:26:08.182
I can buy it for certain person. He will
like it” -

00:26:08.383 --> 00:26:13.214
because I’ll know what they like, so
I’ll buy that thing for that person.”

00:26:13.415 --> 00:26:17.711
Or else if I’m buying something for
my family, I think the same.

00:26:17.912 --> 00:26:21.343
Like I’ve built a house now where I’m going
to put all the things,

00:26:21.544 --> 00:26:24.016
the presents you have given, everything,
like a museum,

00:26:24.217 --> 00:26:27.149
and I’m going to ask all the villagers
to come and see it.

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:31.583
Because they have never seen such things.
They can’t travel to Switzerland,

00:26:31.784 --> 00:26:34.661
leave alone England. So we have to –

00:26:34.862 --> 00:26:38.810
I’m thinking of making that house in such
a manner that these villagers,

00:26:39.011 --> 00:26:42.596
who have never seen beautiful things,
should come and see.

00:26:42.797 --> 00:26:47.104
In India, it’s not a case very much with
the simple people to have jealousies.

00:26:47.305 --> 00:26:52.199
Only the new materialistic people have
developed this habit of jealousy.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:56.105
But otherwise, they will always say,
“What a nice thing!

00:26:56.306 --> 00:26:59.096
How beautiful it is! How they are!”

00:26:59.297 --> 00:27:06.728
Like you were singing songs about Sahaja
Yoga in Poona.

00:27:07.205 --> 00:27:10.683
Actually, you have really picked up
very well, I must say,

00:27:10.884 --> 00:27:14.738
but there were masters of this music
sitting there, watching you singing.

00:27:14.939 --> 00:27:22.078
They were the masters of drama and play,
very well-known artists in India.

00:27:22.279 --> 00:27:25.609
And then they said that…

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:29.734
where you went to see their play, also
in Poona if you remember.

00:27:29.935 --> 00:27:34.013
So they offered Me, “Mother, that we want
to celebrate Your birthday.”

00:27:34.214 --> 00:27:38.057
I said, “It’s very difficult because you’ll
be so far away.” “No, no, we’ll come!”

00:27:38.258 --> 00:27:40.422
The whole night they travelled

00:27:40.623 --> 00:27:43.929
and the whole day, practically. They came
about five o’clock, imagine.

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:48.781
They finished their drama about, say,
3 o’clock or 4 o’clock,

00:27:48.982 --> 00:27:52.301
and then they travelled all the day,
arrived at about 5 o’clock

00:27:52.502 --> 00:27:57.868
from somewhere called Belgam, and 6:30
was the programme.

00:27:58.069 --> 00:28:02.202
So they were all dressed up, came,
and what a comparing they did!

00:28:02.403 --> 00:28:06.156
They said, “We were ashamed. We used
to think that we Maharashtrians

00:28:06.357 --> 00:28:09.595
are very good at music, very good at talas
and this.

00:28:09.796 --> 00:28:14.013
But we were ashamed the way these
foreigners sang

00:28:14.214 --> 00:28:18.868
our music so well. We cannot sing
like them.

00:28:19.069 --> 00:28:23.231
Though their music we cannot sing, while
they sang our music

00:28:23.432 --> 00:28:26.579
and we were all very much ashamed
and embarrassed.

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:30.699
How could they sing so well?” And
the appreciation was so great

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:34.310
that I was myself embarrassed, the way
they were saying,

00:28:34.511 --> 00:28:38.109
“How it has happened to these people?
What is – their guru – have done?

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:41.956
What have they done to these people,
that they can sing so well?”

00:28:42.157 --> 00:28:46.967
So the appreciation and the whole thing
enamoured. We have a tape of that, I think.

00:28:47.168 --> 00:28:49.695
Audio tape; I don’t know if you have
video tape or not,

00:28:49.896 --> 00:28:52.826
but if you have, please get it.
It’s very interesting the way

00:28:53.027 --> 00:28:56.192
they appreciated my children, the way
they were singing.

00:28:56.393 --> 00:28:59.731
And to them, I felt in their saying
and all that,

00:28:59.932 --> 00:29:02.402
because they are such masters and

00:29:02.603 --> 00:29:06.366
so developed in their – the way
they were appreciating,

00:29:06.567 --> 00:29:09.696
as if they were appreciating children
singing something great.

00:29:09.897 --> 00:29:15.870
See the – in that the rapport was that
of a – a very sweet rapport of vatsalya,

00:29:16.071 --> 00:29:21.455
is the feeling of a motherliness,

00:29:21.656 --> 00:29:25.305
that, “Look at these children, are singing
so well.”

00:29:25.506 --> 00:29:30.562
It’s happened with many people I have
seen, when some artists came, as you know,

00:29:30.763 --> 00:29:35.494
that when they saw you people appreciating
and singing, they had the same feeling,

00:29:35.695 --> 00:29:39.093
“How could these children – how could
these people sing so well?

00:29:39.294 --> 00:29:45.302
How did they know so well?”.
I mean, all that beautiful feeling

00:29:45.503 --> 00:29:49.745
and all that appreciation created
such a nice atmosphere,

00:29:49.946 --> 00:29:53.797
as we had some very great artists
and how they appreciated you,

00:29:53.998 --> 00:29:56.791
instead of saying that, “Oh, what,
what are these,

00:29:56.992 --> 00:29:59.763
are no good for music and.” Nothing!

00:29:59.964 --> 00:30:01.747
They have so much appreciated that
these people

00:30:01.948 --> 00:30:05.014
who have never known Indian music
are singing so well.

00:30:05.215 --> 00:30:09.868
So in that appreciation also, that
fatherliness, that motherliness was there,

00:30:10.053 --> 00:30:14.978
that vatsalya was there, and the situation
was so beautiful.

00:30:15.179 --> 00:30:20.676
Even, say, when a person like Ravi Shankar
has to play with Yehudi Menuhin.

00:30:20.877 --> 00:30:25.604
Yehudi Menuhin is a child before him.
But I have seen how he looks after him

00:30:25.805 --> 00:30:30.577
and how he protects him, as we say
in my Hindi language “samhala”.

00:30:30.778 --> 00:30:34.569
All the time is looking after him
and managing it.

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:41.131
And also, we have seen in the music part,
when supposing a tabla-wallah is sitting,

00:30:41.332 --> 00:30:44.820
and a very senior musician is sitting,
Master is sitting.

00:30:45.021 --> 00:30:48.419
He’ll say, “Please look after me, Samhala,
look after me,”

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:54.885
always with very great feeling of a child
that, “You look after me.”

00:30:55.086 --> 00:30:59.068
All these things are very important in life
to create good relationships

00:30:59.285 --> 00:31:03.117
between ourselves also. Those who are
younger to us,

00:31:03.318 --> 00:31:08.705
those who are not so well-off, or those
who are not so much talented,

00:31:08.906 --> 00:31:15.658
or those who are not so much equipped
in knowledge of Sahaja Yoga,

00:31:15.859 --> 00:31:19.372
or who are not so much senior in Sahaja
Yoga.

00:31:19.562 --> 00:31:24.214
We have to look after the others, like
in a very fatherly manner

00:31:24.415 --> 00:31:28.845
or, we can say, as a motherly manner,
that they are not equipped. So alright.

00:31:29.046 --> 00:31:32.257
We have a Ganesha Tattwa, so excite
their Ganesha Tattwa.

00:31:32.458 --> 00:31:39.807
They should feel dependant on us
for achieving the mastery,

00:31:40.008 --> 00:31:43.362
or achieving the higher state. As the Guru
Principle

00:31:43.563 --> 00:31:46.902
is absolutely bound by Ganesha Principle.

00:31:47.103 --> 00:31:49.191
If a guru does not have a Ganesh Principle,

00:31:49.392 --> 00:31:53.896
he becomes a horrid, horrid, horrid fellow
and nobody wants to stick onto him

00:31:54.097 --> 00:31:57.560
and they all run away from him. Though
he might punish,

00:31:57.761 --> 00:32:03.140
he might also get angry with the disciples.
But basically what he thinks,

00:32:03.341 --> 00:32:07.633
“He is my progeny, I am developing him,
I’m building up.”

00:32:07.834 --> 00:32:10.282
But in the modern thinking is that,

00:32:10.483 --> 00:32:13.283
“Let them be individuals, let them
be independent.”

00:32:13.484 --> 00:32:17.407
So the father and mother do not look
after their children in that manner

00:32:17.608 --> 00:32:22.474
that they should. “That see, this is my
son, I’ve got a talent. I must teach him,

00:32:22.675 --> 00:32:28.257
he must come up, he is the one who is
a continuation of my own self.”

00:32:28.458 --> 00:32:31.823
So this idea of having every individual,
you are individual,

00:32:32.024 --> 00:32:35.971
at eighteen years you get out of the house,
you do what you like, stand on your legs.

00:32:36.172 --> 00:32:42.078
No, life is a continuous basis. It is
not just “you stand on your legs”,

00:32:42.279 --> 00:32:47.833
but is a question of one has to be
all the time connected with the whole.

00:32:48.034 --> 00:32:52.292
Unless and until you are connected
completely,

00:32:52.493 --> 00:32:56.215
we cannot understand collectivity
of innocence.

00:32:56.416 --> 00:32:59.975
The collectivity of innocence, I see
sometimes, I’m very happy

00:33:00.176 --> 00:33:05.350
that a child of somebody is in the lap
of somebody, sitting very sweetly,

00:33:05.551 --> 00:33:09.780
coming as if he is your own father, coming
and sitting just on your lap,

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:12.596
without knowing that, “He is not
my father.”

00:33:12.797 --> 00:33:16.266
But still, that consciousness is not there.

00:33:16.578 --> 00:33:19.722
So this breaks the feeling of my
and possession,

00:33:19.923 --> 00:33:22.173
that, “This is mine, this is mine,
this is mine.”

00:33:22.374 --> 00:33:29.151
And what makes you - the feeling that
we are now a means,

00:33:29.401 --> 00:33:32.182
a means, we can say, an instrument,

00:33:32.383 --> 00:33:36.887
a media, by which we express the Ganesha
Tattwa all over,

00:33:37.088 --> 00:33:42.261
that is vibrations. So the vibrations
itself, about which you are asking,

00:33:42.462 --> 00:33:46.503
these vibrations themselves are nothing
but the Principle of Shri Ganesha.

00:33:46.704 --> 00:33:49.876
He is Omkara. And when it is,
then what is it,

00:33:50.077 --> 00:33:53.962
that feeling as I told you, the vatsalya,

00:33:54.163 --> 00:33:58.601
the feeling of love between a child
and a mother.

00:33:58.802 --> 00:34:04.256
That feeling, it is the one that is
vibrations,

00:34:04.457 --> 00:34:11.454
between the child and the mother.
The distance between the two is vibrations,

00:34:11.655 --> 00:34:14.115
and that’s what one has to feel –

00:34:14.316 --> 00:34:22.804
that he’s a child still and there’s the
mother and mother is bringing the child,

00:34:23.005 --> 00:34:27.565
giving all the powers to the child,
bringing up, loving the child,

00:34:27.766 --> 00:34:32.629
understanding the limitations of the child,
looking after, all that.

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:39.589
All the sweetness, all the wisdom
of the child to be appreciated.

00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:43.741
That is vibrations. And if you see
the subtle side of this,

00:34:43.942 --> 00:34:49.662
it’s not “my” child. Should not – this is
not only a limited thing,

00:34:49.863 --> 00:34:55.369
because it is eternal, it’s everywhere,
so you cannot have it limited.

00:34:55.570 --> 00:35:02.926
In everything you do, I have seen, people
the way they handle things in the West –

00:35:03.127 --> 00:35:06.856
we Indians have to learn also from them.

00:35:09.837 --> 00:35:12.292
What’s happening?

00:35:13.952 --> 00:35:18.476
So we have to accept for them what is -

00:35:18.677 --> 00:35:23.040
what is the way to handle also beautiful
things,

00:35:23.241 --> 00:35:29.435
how to look after beautiful things, how
to manage beautiful relationships.

00:35:29.636 --> 00:35:34.854
See, you shouldn’t be harsh, you shouldn’t
be unkind, you shouldn’t say things,

00:35:35.055 --> 00:35:39.925
which are insulting to others, so that
the relationships are broken.

00:35:40.126 --> 00:35:44.131
So all the relationships that are between
human beings and God,

00:35:44.332 --> 00:35:49.726
are through the Ganesha Principle. So
when it becomes the relationship

00:35:49.927 --> 00:35:54.377
between you and God, then there are
vibrations.

00:35:54.578 --> 00:35:59.959
And then that same relationship should
extend to everything that you do.

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:05.737
You should see what things are good,
whatever has got vibrations.

00:36:05.938 --> 00:36:09.337
Today I want to tell you something
very important

00:36:09.538 --> 00:36:12.836
about this all-pervading power we heard
about.

00:36:13.037 --> 00:36:18.395
These are nothing but vibrations. This
Paramachaitanya is nothing but vibrations,

00:36:18.596 --> 00:36:21.086
where all identities are lost –

00:36:21.287 --> 00:36:24.287
where the mother is lost, father is lost,
we can say,

00:36:24.488 --> 00:36:34.527
nothing remains, then it is just these
vibrations, this subtle vatsalya exists.

00:36:34.728 --> 00:36:38.888
That’s all. And this is the only thing,

00:36:39.089 --> 00:36:43.910
out of which everything comes and remains
in itself.

00:36:44.111 --> 00:36:47.036
Like we can say that the sun’s rays
come out

00:36:47.237 --> 00:36:51.771
and then they try to create chlorophyll.

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:56.306
So it’s not that we cannot compare sun
with that.

00:36:56.507 --> 00:37:02.094
Or we can say, from the ocean the clouds
come out

00:37:02.295 --> 00:37:09.476
and they try to nourish the Mother Earth.
That’s also not – cannot be compared.

00:37:09.677 --> 00:37:11.673
Everything is inside that.

00:37:11.874 --> 00:37:15.589
This Paramachaitanya has got everything
inside this.

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:20.637
So we can say that everything is nothing
but knowledge,

00:37:20.838 --> 00:37:24.167
is nothing but truth, is nothing but light.

00:37:24.368 --> 00:37:28.629
But when the folds of these come out,

00:37:29.199 --> 00:37:35.938
then we get into the folds of that
Chaitanya and then we become ignorant.

00:37:36.139 --> 00:37:41.466
But there is nothing like ignorance.
It doesn’t exist, it doesn’t exist.

00:37:41.667 --> 00:37:45.061
Like there is darkness because there’s
no light.

00:37:45.262 --> 00:37:51.501
Once light comes, it doesn’t exist, doesn’t
exist. So ignorance doesn’t exist.

00:37:51.702 --> 00:38:00.468
But what happens that the folds of this
ocean, into that people go and it is lost.

00:38:01.234 --> 00:38:03.880
Thus we understand one thing very clearly:

00:38:04.081 --> 00:38:08.604
that we are in Paramachaitanya.
We are made by Paramachaitanya,

00:38:08.805 --> 00:38:12.131
all the time we are surrounded by it.
Only thing is,

00:38:12.332 --> 00:38:15.704
we are sometimes lost in the folds.

00:38:15.905 --> 00:38:18.829
And why? Why we are lost in the folds

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:30.678
is because of our own – our own
unawareness.

00:38:30.879 --> 00:38:37.497
This awareness has to come: that we are
part and parcel of that Paramachaitanya.

00:38:37.698 --> 00:38:45.873
The whole thing is called as chidvilasa,
is the vilas,

00:38:46.619 --> 00:38:53.074
is the playful enjoyment of God’s
Attention.

00:38:53.923 --> 00:38:55.952
Now you will say, “How can that be?”

00:38:56.153 --> 00:39:00.729
For example, we see the sun –just to give
a simile closer to it,

00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:06.700
we see the sun and then we see the water.
We see the water in the lake, alright?

00:39:06.901 --> 00:39:10.778
There is water – because of the sun,
we can see the water there.

00:39:10.979 --> 00:39:14.361
Then supposing, we see the mirage.

00:39:14.562 --> 00:39:18.987
We see the mirage and then we think
this is water,

00:39:19.188 --> 00:39:24.666
we go run after the water. But the whole
thing is the play of the sun:

00:39:25.064 --> 00:39:29.690
whether it’s a mirage, whether it’s
a water, whether it’s the sun.

00:39:31.678 --> 00:39:35.128
In the same way, this Paramachaitanya acts

00:39:35.329 --> 00:39:41.203
and what we get lost is, in our awareness,
that we are Paramachaitanya.

00:39:41.404 --> 00:39:44.436
That’s why the play starts, the play starts

00:39:44.637 --> 00:39:50.215
like yesterday’s – day before yesterday’s
Puja, what did we do?

00:39:50.692 --> 00:39:54.270
We were sitting there and it started
raining.

00:39:54.471 --> 00:40:01.366
So - to prove, to prove that I can control
rain.

00:40:01.671 --> 00:40:05.029
So it rained. Some people were
covering up, some thing, this thing.

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:09.315
I gave a bandhan. After some time,
the rain moved out

00:40:09.516 --> 00:40:14.817
from the Puja to the back side. It was
not raining where you were sitting.

00:40:15.018 --> 00:40:19.440
And after that, it became a sun and
it was so clouded.

00:40:19.641 --> 00:40:21.882
Sun came, it was, became sunny,

00:40:22.083 --> 00:40:27.932
so that’s how you have to become aware
of the powers of Chaitanya.

00:40:28.133 --> 00:40:33.066
Now when you give bandhan, what you do
is to put the Chaitanya into action,

00:40:33.267 --> 00:40:36.552
“Now act here, act there, act here.”

00:40:36.753 --> 00:40:43.154
Though you are, supposing, in the ocean,
but the ocean acts on you all the time.

00:40:43.355 --> 00:40:46.334
You cannot act on the ocean, you cannot
ask water

00:40:46.535 --> 00:40:50.019
to do this and do that. But as realised
souls, you are empowered,

00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:55.234
now you can ask water, “Alright, you
dissolve this, you do this, you do that.”

00:40:56.269 --> 00:40:58.804
But for that, it is important to be
the masters.

00:40:59.005 --> 00:41:03.391
And to become the masters, you see -
like a matter becomes a human being,

00:41:03.592 --> 00:41:06.954
and from human being, you have to become
the masters of the matter

00:41:07.155 --> 00:41:10.404
and you handle the matter.  So we come
back to the same.

00:41:10.605 --> 00:41:13.732
Like agriculture, we can handle, just
vibrating it.

00:41:13.933 --> 00:41:16.350
We can handle water, we can handle
the sun,

00:41:16.551 --> 00:41:18.896
we can handle moon - because there’s
a rapport.

00:41:19.097 --> 00:41:22.714
Now we are aware, a rapport has been
established.

00:41:22.915 --> 00:41:27.080
So all this play is extremely beautiful
to me. I see it.

00:41:27.281 --> 00:41:34.279
But now you all have to know that you
all have become realised souls

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:40.596
and you have those powers. So all
other nonsensical things that you learn,

00:41:40.797 --> 00:41:44.311
all nonsensical things you indulge into,
you’d better give up.

00:41:44.512 --> 00:41:48.995
There’s no sense in it. Whatever is
sensible you should do

00:41:49.196 --> 00:41:52.646
because there’s Shri Ganesha within you,
who is absolutely sensible.

00:41:52.847 --> 00:41:55.879
He is nothing but sense. He is the giver
of sense,

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:59.402
so He is the killer of the demons,
as they say.

00:41:59.603 --> 00:42:02.649
He is the one who removes all the ordeals.
By how?

00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:05.215
By improving our awareness.

00:42:05.416 --> 00:42:10.395
Though ordeals do not remain because
you give a bandhan, it works out.

00:42:10.596 --> 00:42:15.065
Now I asked somebody – Phil – I asked
him to write down about the miracles,

00:42:15.266 --> 00:42:19.400
and he says now it has become like
a voluminous book.

00:42:19.601 --> 00:42:23.375
It will be because before realization

00:42:23.576 --> 00:42:27.852
whatever looked like miracle is no more
a miracle. Miracle has lost its meaning.

00:42:28.053 --> 00:42:30.448
Because now you are empowered
and you can do it.

00:42:30.649 --> 00:42:35.104
It works in everything: in your talent,
in your understanding,

00:42:35.305 --> 00:42:38.578
in your education, in every way. Like
there are some boys who said,

00:42:38.779 --> 00:42:42.213
“Mother, You see, we couldn’t solve
one problem so we gave a bandhan.

00:42:42.414 --> 00:42:46.552
Immediately the whole thing came onto us
and we wrote it down” and they stood first.

00:42:46.753 --> 00:42:51.809
It has happened with many. So in every
action, in everything,

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:56.886
whatever you do, you should know it is
the Paramachaitanya that acts.

00:42:57.087 --> 00:43:01.018
Only thing you have to be aware
of yourself, and aware of it, it acts;

00:43:01.219 --> 00:43:06.140
and you just jump into that awareness
and it works.

00:43:07.081 --> 00:43:12.262
And that you have seen. But still,
so many people do not know.

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:16.385
So many people still, though they know
through their brains,

00:43:16.586 --> 00:43:18.935
do not know in their hearts. And so many
people,

00:43:19.136 --> 00:43:22.714
even if they know in their hearts,
they do not act in their attention.

00:43:22.915 --> 00:43:26.773
So only these three things you have
to improve: is one is your head,

00:43:26.974 --> 00:43:29.817
another is your heart and third is
your liver.

00:43:30.018 --> 00:43:33.988
If you can improve these three organs,
this Paramachaitanya will act.

00:43:34.189 --> 00:43:36.923
But then, all this attention about money.

00:43:37.124 --> 00:43:41.603
So many people, money this, that.
There’s nothing to worry.

00:43:42.088 --> 00:43:44.979
Paramachaitanya will create everything
for you, whatever you want.

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:48.617
It may not create money because it
doesn’t have a mint, but it will create

00:43:48.818 --> 00:43:51.119
possibilities –

00:43:54.852 --> 00:44:00.253
possibilities. And this is something to be
understood very well, and it’s so blissful

00:44:00.454 --> 00:44:03.368
to know that now you are aware
of the Paramachaitanya

00:44:03.569 --> 00:44:07.829
and you can master it. Master it
in the sense not that you dominate it,

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:10.344
but you ask him like a jinn. You know,
you can say,

00:44:10.545 --> 00:44:15.230
“All right, do this, do that”, with
respect. With respect it works.

00:44:15.431 --> 00:44:19.374
But the way sometimes we do not pay
respect to Paramachaitanya

00:44:19.575 --> 00:44:24.482
is also something surprising. The way we
act all the time, the way we are behaving.

00:44:24.683 --> 00:44:29.181
Like in my presence, people will sit down
and close their eyes,

00:44:29.382 --> 00:44:34.538
or they will start worshipping
the photograph instead of me.

00:44:34.739 --> 00:44:38.190
Sometimes, the way they handle
their Kundalini,

00:44:38.391 --> 00:44:42.205
sometimes, the way they behave towards
themselves and others -

00:44:42.406 --> 00:44:44.138
all these things are to be understood,

00:44:44.339 --> 00:44:47.089
now that we have entered into the Kingdom
of God,

00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:54.804
means Paramachaitanya, and that we are
very important citizens of that.

00:44:55.005 --> 00:45:00.898
If one can understand this, then I think,
Sahaja Yoga can be very successful.

00:45:01.099 --> 00:45:04.922
Everything will work out. It, miraculously,
everything will work out.

00:45:05.123 --> 00:45:08.213
And all those who are not aware

00:45:08.414 --> 00:45:11.535
about the possibilities as to what they
can reach,

00:45:11.736 --> 00:45:14.400
they are thrown out, in the sense,
in the fold,

00:45:14.601 --> 00:45:18.256
in the ignorance, so-called, into
the darkness.

00:45:18.457 --> 00:45:22.085
Again they can come back to light
when they have sense.

00:45:22.286 --> 00:45:25.675
So be forgiving about them. It can happen
to you also

00:45:25.876 --> 00:45:27.772
if you understand that way.

00:45:27.973 --> 00:45:32.676
I hope, today’s lecture you have been
able to assimilate within yourself.

00:45:32.877 --> 00:45:37.657
That’s very important to assimilate, to
know that you are in the Paramachaitanya.

00:45:37.858 --> 00:45:43.738
And that’s how you’ll become very sweet,
you’ll become very considerate,

00:45:43.939 --> 00:45:52.039
and very loving, affectionate and wise.
That’s very important.

00:45:53.039 --> 00:45:55.891
May God bless you.

00:46:21.741 --> 00:46:25.739
The point, about which some leaders
have said, that

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:30.614
you people don’t buy individually my tapes.

00:46:30.815 --> 00:46:34.913
And then, you come to the ashrams and
want to listen to my tapes again and again.

00:46:35.114 --> 00:46:37.579
And you spoil the tapes. This is wrong.

00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:40.970
You are all sahaja yogis, you must
respect.

00:46:41.171 --> 00:46:47.194
And all of you must try to get the tapes
properly,

00:46:47.395 --> 00:46:54.877
in proper manner, and should use your own
tapes carefully and with respect.

00:46:55.078 --> 00:47:00.311
Because some people are taking away also
the tapes from the ashrams and using them.

00:47:00.512 --> 00:47:05.080
No, it’s very precious. All of you should
treat it as a very precious thing.

00:47:05.281 --> 00:47:12.193
And all of you should take tapes which have
been created by the ashram and use them.

00:47:12.394 --> 00:47:16.043
But in the ashram you can use it once
in a while.

00:47:16.244 --> 00:47:20.854
But for your house, for your car -

00:47:21.055 --> 00:47:25.486
or I have seen that in other horrible
false guru’s people, they just take

00:47:25.687 --> 00:47:29.577
the tapes, never play any music, nothing,
they are just playing the tapes.

00:47:29.778 --> 00:47:32.421
So in the same way, you can have that,

00:47:32.622 --> 00:47:37.293
because it’s not easy to understand
my lecture in one first shot.

00:47:37.494 --> 00:47:40.577
You have to individually sit down
and listen to it

00:47:40.778 --> 00:47:43.839
and decode it and see for yourself,
what it is.

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:49.178
Because my - I myself when I listen
to my lectures, I get lost.
