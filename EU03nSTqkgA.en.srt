1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:11,280
Today is a sad day because such a great man
like Sadat is dead.

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,480
He is not great to Me because he was a great
politician or he was president, but he was

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,570
a saint, he was a realized soul, I knew all
about him.

4
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:35,611
The attack of the negativity is on but no
more they will crucify a saint this way and

5
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:39,079
will not face the punishment.

6
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:43,410
They will be punished now.

7
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:53,749
All those who tried to do such things will
be punished because the new age has started.

8
00:00:53,749 --> 00:01:05,269
Today I wanted to tell you about the Agya
chakra, about Jesus Christ who adorns this

9
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:11,619
center of Agya chakra, where you see the red
mark.

10
00:01:11,619 --> 00:01:23,501
Behind that, inside, in the brain on the crossing
of the optic chiasm is this subtle center

11
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:34,760
where this great Deity is placed through His
crucifixion and through His Resurrection.

12
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,939
He has created this space for us to enter
into the Kingdom of God, which is placed within

13
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:41,939
us.

14
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:55,320
Is not in without, is the limbic area that
surrounds your ego and superego.

15
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:02,210
In the Puranas, in the ancient scriptures
of India, Christ is described so very clearly.

16
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:10,640
Actually in the Bible what they saw of Him
when He was on this Earth was written down.

17
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:17,710
But nothing what created Him, how He came
on this Earth what is the spirit of Christ,

18
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:23,130
what is the seat of Christ and how He came
and what is His purpose and where does He

19
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,130
stand within us.

20
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:30,400
All these things are not described in the
Bible as I told you the people at that time

21
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:40,410
were not at all aware of His greatness, of
His special Incarnation.

22
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:50,360
But if you read some of these ancient books
you’ll find that He was called as Mahavishnu

23
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:57,190
in the Devi Purana, in the Goddess Purana,
is the ancient scripture of the Goddess.

24
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:02,160
Mahavishnu was created immaculately.

25
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:17,380
Now when we say that Christ always pointed
out this pick is very significant.

26
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:26,900
Actually this, this means Vishuddhi chakra
and means also America.

27
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:33,020
But this also means Vishuddhi chakra stands
for Shri Krishna as I told you and He is the

28
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:43,510
Primordial Being, and He is the epitome of
our evolution in the sense that He is the

29
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:51,320
Primordial Being who is the Father, who is
the preserver.

30
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:58,450
Now in the Puranas He is described that His
power was Radha, Radha.

31
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:05,100
Sanskrit language is absolutely very scientific
as far as the Divine Laws are concerned.

32
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,440
Ra means the energy, dha means the one that
sustains.

33
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:16,780
[SANSKRIT TALK] She is the one who sustains
the energy and She was His power.

34
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:23,090
But in India Krishna is never taken as Krishna
Radha but Radha Krishna.

35
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:29,060
The energy is before the deity.

36
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:33,430
The lady is before the gentleman, we can say.

37
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,789
Radha Krishna.

38
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:42,950
Now this special happening took place long
time back.

39
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:52,160
This is at the stage of Vaikunta as we call
it, at the stage where nothing existed as

40
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,060
far as this world was concerned.

41
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,100
At different stages it came up.

42
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:05,980
We see the world in such a way that it was
created in seven days, but actually these

43
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:11,710
are seven stages in when this whole Universe
was created and we are at the seventh stage,

44
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:12,940
we can say.

45
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:20,640
Now at the first Vaikunta stage where it was
all decided, how to work it out the creation

46
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:29,620
of this great personality, of the Son of God,
the greatest of all, the Adhara, the support

47
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,040
of the universe, this Mahavishnu.

48
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:40,880
So Radha, She’s Mahalakshmi, She is the
central path.

49
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:50,620
First She created Him in the Vaikunta stage.

50
00:05:50,620 --> 00:06:01,021
And at that stage She decided that She’ll
create It by Herself this great Incarnation

51
00:06:01,021 --> 00:06:05,710
and She created this Mahavishnu.

52
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:14,290
I would like you to get the translation of
the description of Mahavishnu and also the

53
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:23,460
description of Ganesha who is the Spirit of
Christ and who incarnated in this, on this

54
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:28,980
earth as our Lord Jesus Christ.

55
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:45,419
So we have here an Incarnation, a very special
one, which was conceived thousands and thousands

56
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:54,620
of years back at this level where it’s only
the activity of the God’s mind was there,

57
00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:04,880
Vaikunta stage, where it was decided that
this power called Radha will conceive Him

58
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,020
in Her heart.

59
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:13,280
And She conceived Him in Her heart.

60
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,949
And then He was made like an egg.

61
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:23,020
See the symbolism of Easter, like an egg.

62
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,370
Can you recognize it?

63
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,560
People knew about it somehow.

64
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,290
Why do we have Easter, eggs?

65
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:36,180
We never think about it.

66
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:46,990
He was created like an egg out of which the
half of it was kept as the seed, as Shri Ganesha,

67
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:53,090
as the Spirit, and a half of it was created
as Jesus Christ.

68
00:07:53,090 --> 00:08:05,370
The whole egg was nothing but the egg of this
Divine power, which has to manifest this Divine

69
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:09,220
power on this Earth.

70
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:19,220
This story is very beautiful, how She created
and then He asked: “Who is my Father?”

71
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:23,870
Radha is nobody else but Mother Mary Herself.

72
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,480
She is Mahalakshmi.

73
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,479
People may say that they can’t believe in
immaculate birth of Christ.

74
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,950
They cannot believe in the conception of Christ.

75
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:38,349
I mean you it’s easy for people to say:”
We don’t believe.”

76
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:40,469
What do they know about God?

77
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:43,509
What do they know about His mysterious ways
of doing it?

78
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:51,199
Can you say how you convert or you transform
a flower into a fruit?

79
00:08:51,199 --> 00:09:00,620
You don’t know anything about living miracles
and you start doubting the Immaculate Conception.

80
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:06,800
Here, when you got your Realization I conceived
you in My heart and gave you Realization through

81
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,430
My Sahasrara.

82
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,540
How did you get your Realization?

83
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,709
You never thought of it.

84
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:16,019
Is an impossibility.

85
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:18,029
Thousands of people are getting Realization.

86
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:19,209
How is it possible?

87
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:24,970
There must be something special about Me and
about the way it is done.

88
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:31,519
In the same way She conceived and gave Him
the birth through Her uterus.

89
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,819
You can move it anywhere on your central system.

90
00:09:37,819 --> 00:09:54,990
And this great Incarnation came on this Earth
with such a special purpose that He was nothing

91
00:09:54,990 --> 00:10:05,199
but Pranava, is the, this integrated power,
this great power which has all the powers

92
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:09,730
in it: the Iccha Shakti, the Prana Shakti
and the Dharma Shakti is the central path,

93
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:14,639
all of these put together.

94
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:30,839
He was nothing but energy, energy put into
an egg because He had to do a very great job.

95
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:46,220
So this Radha Herself, this Mahalakshmi, this
Mother Mary conceived this child and to name

96
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:51,170
Him after Krishna who was the Father.

97
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,329
She called Him Christ.

98
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:59,929
Christ come from the word ... In Indian language
is, we call Him Krist, Krishna.

99
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:05,850
Krishna means the one who has sown the seed.

100
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:06,850
He is the Father.

101
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,270
He points out always to the Father.

102
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:15,470
But in the Puranas it is described that Krishna
said: “You are higher than Me.

103
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,829
I placed You higher than Me”.

104
00:11:18,829 --> 00:11:29,089
He placed Him, you can imagine that Christ
is at this point and Krishna is at this point.

105
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:36,310
He placed higher Him than Him and He said:
“In anywhere people worship Me – Shri

106
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:40,829
Krishna said – automatically You are worshipped.

107
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:47,069
You will be the support, Adhara, of the whole
world.”

108
00:11:47,069 --> 00:11:55,011
Is wonderful to say that about I think 14000
years or 12000 years back, Markandeya, such

109
00:11:55,011 --> 00:11:57,779
a great saint was born in India.

110
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:04,139
And he has written the complete Ganesha Stotram,
means the complete praise of Ganesha.

111
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:12,730
You can see the translation is so beautiful
and that he said: ”You’ll be so humble”.

112
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:24,019
He is the one who is the ninth Incarnation
called as [BAUTHA] among the ten Incarnations.

113
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:34,319
That He will be so humble that He will wash
the feet of His disciples.

114
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:37,389
All the miracles of Christ are described in
these books.

115
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:41,119
But these books are not translated.

116
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:51,679
And that He will be the one, when enlightened
within you with the Kundalini, He will take

117
00:12:51,679 --> 00:13:02,430
away all your karmas and all your conditionings
because He will die for your sins, for your

118
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,949
karmas.

119
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:15,689
The world will not have to suffer anymore,
if He is awaken within you.

120
00:13:15,689 --> 00:13:20,490
These are all the things already written,
thousands of years back.

121
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,440
Can you imagine?

122
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:30,389
I wish the Christians who went from here to
take, explain Christianity to Indians told

123
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:38,339
them that Mahavishnu is already born and we
are preaching about Him, the One who is going

124
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:44,920
to suck your conditioning, the One who is
going to suck all your problems of karmas.

125
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,649
They never told.

126
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:54,309
On the contrary, they were so stupid, I must
tell you, that they would put a loaf in a

127
00:13:54,309 --> 00:14:00,550
well and say that: “You all have become
Christians because we have put the meat of

128
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,249
the beef, the beef inside the well”.

129
00:14:03,249 --> 00:14:05,929
Indians don’t eat beef, you see.

130
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:08,069
“So you all have become Christians”.

131
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:10,100
Villages after villages they converted into
Christianity.

132
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,389
They started branding them as Christians.

133
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:15,319
This was absurd.

134
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:22,639
And that’s why the people were waiting and
waiting for the Advent of Christ.

135
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:32,559
His name Christ comes from the word Krishna,
Krist, and the second one is Jesus.

136
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:38,190
Krishna had a foster mother whom Radha loved
very much.

137
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:45,490
Her name was Yeshoda, we also call her as
[Jesoda, Jeshoda].

138
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,110
Christ is called also as [Yesu, Yeshu] in
India.

139
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:55,009
The short form of [Jesoda, Jeshoda] is [Yesu,
Yeshu] or [Jeshu, Jesu] we have both the things.

140
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:58,100
From there the name Jesus has come.

141
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:07,550
She wanted to name Her after the foster mother
because she was a lady so she was called as

142
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:14,639
[Jeshoda, Jesoda] but for a man She selected
the name [Yesu, Yeshu] and [Jeshu, Jesu].

143
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:23,290
Moreover the word [Jeshu, Jesu] or [Yeshu,
Yesu] is very important.

144
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:30,100
“J” in Sanskrit language means, every
word has a meaning in Sanskrit language, means

145
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:35,610
to know, is to know, the knowledge, Gyana.

146
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,529
[SANSKRIT TALK].

147
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:40,649
The one who knows.

148
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:45,199
But [Jeshu, Jesu] [“shu”, “su”] means
auspicious.

149
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:51,680
[“Shu”, “Su”] means “that brings
auspiciousness, that brings blessings”.

150
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,629
Jeshu is the one who knows how to bring auspiciousness
on this Earth.

151
00:15:57,629 --> 00:16:06,929
People never told this, they never knew who
went from here with the message that Christ

152
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:11,689
was born.

153
00:16:11,689 --> 00:16:19,089
At the time when Christ came on this Earth
with this big message that somebody has to

154
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:22,819
pass through this special problem.

155
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:26,290
Now let’s see why the problem was there.

156
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:33,339
We have to understand the problem that faced
human beings at that subtle level where they

157
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:41,250
had to work out this special, a very extraordinary
Incarnation.

158
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:48,489
The problem was that human beings had raised
their heads.

159
00:16:48,489 --> 00:16:57,489
By raising their heads their ego and superego
grew up around their limbic area, making it

160
00:16:57,489 --> 00:17:04,089
a very hard shell, just like an egg.

161
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:13,069
A man developed his I-ness and only way to
transform him into a bird, like an egg breaks

162
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:19,279
up into a bird, was to make the Kundalini
rise.

163
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:28,669
But how to make that compact stuff where it
is crossing, crossable, which can be crossed

164
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:32,919
over, which can be passed through.

165
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:41,500
So they had to create this special Incarnation,
which is nothing but Pranava, the Aum, the

166
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:48,639
Logos as you call it, the sound of the All
Pervading Power.

167
00:17:48,639 --> 00:18:00,310
To be put at a place where nothing but the
power itself can remain, because anybody else,

168
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:09,020
all other Incarnations who came on this Earth
had all the five elements within them.

169
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:14,309
But He was just the power, the energy, the
complete energy.

170
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:21,299
He didn’t have, for example we all human
beings are made of five elements on the right

171
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:30,910
hand side as I told you, and when we die the
part that is our body, means one of the five

172
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:35,940
koshas, as they call the cocoons of the body
which is the matter, falls off.

173
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:42,890
Then the water cocoon also falls off and the
soul remains with the Spirit on your head

174
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:46,210
and the Kundalini also there.

175
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:52,770
But He was the only One who had no earth element
in it.

176
00:18:52,770 --> 00:19:03,809
And so it was a very special type of an energy
engulfed, engulfed into a human being was

177
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:04,809
placed.

178
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:10,289
Krishna has said about the eternal life and
about the Spirit.

179
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:17,090
In Sanskrit language is very beautiful because
it’s a mantra: [SANSKRIT].

180
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:25,470
Means it cannot be killed by anyone, the Spirit
cannot be killed.

181
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,040
It is eternal.

182
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,390
You cannot press it.

183
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:34,940
It cannot be flown out by any wind.

184
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:41,940
And He had to prove it and to prove that they
had to have somebody here, on this Earth,

185
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:49,559
with that energy to come in, with a body,
to act like a human being, live like a human

186
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:59,950
being and go through that drama of death to
show that He overcomes the death.

187
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:06,799
The Resurrection is our message, that He resurrects
Himself.

188
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:13,320
He had to die and He had to be resurrected
because He says that it is beyond death.

189
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,179
Krishna has said that the Spirit is beyond
death.

190
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:25,409
And the Spirit had to come on this Earth.

191
00:20:25,409 --> 00:20:34,799
So you understand when we talk of Christ how
little we know as to how this worked out.

192
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:40,039
Is the most difficult thing that he did.

193
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:48,799
And His Mother was the Mahalakshmi, is the
power, which is the central power of sustenance,

194
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,360
pure sustenance, pure holiness, pure innocence.

195
00:20:53,360 --> 00:21:00,860
Such a powerful woman She was, very powerful.

196
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:10,220
And Himself is endowed with, you won’t believe,
with eleven powers of Rudra, means of destruction,

197
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,550
eleven powers of Rudra.

198
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,840
He’s Ekadesha Rudra.

199
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:19,210
Is described, all that is described, I’m
not telling it as My own.

200
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:23,280
You can see for yourself.

201
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:29,789
He was endowed with eleven powers of destruction.

202
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:35,600
But He was to go through all this, with all
the humility.

203
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:43,700
When you have all these powers with you and
when egoistical people behave like this, these

204
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:50,720
donkeys, you see, who could not understand
Him, these brainless people in those days,

205
00:21:50,720 --> 00:22:01,210
who could not believe Him, He could have destroyed
all of them in one [SHOT, SHUT].

206
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,179
Absolutely He has got eleven Rudras.

207
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:11,890
You can imagine His destructive powers, with
which He is going to come back.

208
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,850
And He had to keep them in control.

209
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:24,090
But He didn’t say about His Mother much,
because She was the power and if He had said

210
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:32,179
so, then they would have directed, these negative
forces would have directed all their attention

211
00:22:32,179 --> 00:22:37,539
towards Her and then He would have used all
these eleven powers and the whole drama would

212
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:38,610
have been failed.

213
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:40,759
So He kept quiet on that.

214
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:46,450
My father, as I told you, was a learned man
and a very great soul and [WE] used to discuss

215
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:54,680
about these things and I said: “Martin Luther,
who was a Realized soul, when he started his

216
00:22:54,680 --> 00:23:06,850
new movement of Protestants, why did he not
enhance the glory of the Mother?”

217
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:13,960
As the Catholics knew, because Catholics just
followed after Christ so it linked about with

218
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,090
them.

219
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:22,460
My father told Me that at that time Martin
Luther faced three forces against him.

220
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:29,240
First one was the Christians themselves, the
Catholics, who believed in nunneries and all

221
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:38,700
kinds of ritualism and all kinds of nonsense,
which he wanted to flout, then he had another

222
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:46,480
force, which was facing and that one was the
one that came from the Jews because they would

223
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,960
not accept Him.

224
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,260
Even today they don’t accept Him.

225
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,460
They are very adamant.

226
00:23:53,460 --> 00:24:02,730
And the third force that he had to face was
the Islam, Islamic.

227
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:13,799
And the Islam pleaded down the role of a woman
though Fatima Herself was the Holy Ghost,

228
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:18,750
is the Mahakali power, the daughter of Mohammad.

229
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:26,509
But he pleaded down just because the Islam
had pleaded down he thought gradually as Protestants

230
00:24:26,509 --> 00:24:36,759
will grow up, he will start introducing the
greatness of His Mother.

231
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:46,850
As it is Jews even today are after the Immaculate
Conception.

232
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:52,559
In London, very recently, I think about two
years back, as they have money they paid some

233
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,450
of the newspapers and published something
nonsensical about Christ.

234
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:07,730
They said that it was predicted in the Bible
that a child will be born to a girl, but it

235
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:15,090
was not a virgin, the Hebrew word, as it is,
is for the girl and not a virgin.

236
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:23,790
I said: “In those days, we didn’t have
girls of 18 years as we have today”.

237
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:29,130
Even in India today if you say a girl, a [KANYA,]
means a virgin, [KANYA] and virgin is the

238
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:33,720
same, means the Virgo.

239
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,879
Modern times are funny.

240
00:25:34,879 --> 00:25:37,790
We can’t judge Christ style according to
modern times.

241
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:44,730
Even you find a woman who is married ten times
they’ll call her a girl here.

242
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:48,000
But one should logically understand this point.

243
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,850
Is very logical.

244
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:57,860
But if it was to be said that a prophecy means
something special, that a child would be born

245
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:03,409
to a girl, of course it is going to be born
to a girl and not to a boy.

246
00:26:03,409 --> 00:26:06,970
And why was the girl word?

247
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,179
It is going to be born to a boy.

248
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:10,889
If it is to a woman it is nothing special.

249
00:26:10,889 --> 00:26:13,110
What is there to prophesize and say about
it?

250
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:24,129
Is so logical that when the word girl came
in it meant the virgin.

251
00:26:24,129 --> 00:26:26,639
All kind of things they are talking, doesn’t
matter.

252
00:26:26,639 --> 00:26:31,760
First of all they say that our, we have to
suffer till our Savior comes because Christ

253
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,770
didn’t suffer for them.

254
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:39,370
So they are suffering.

255
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:49,500
Now, we have to know that Christ has suffered
for us absolutely to the brim.

256
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,640
We don’t have to suffer anymore.

257
00:26:52,640 --> 00:27:06,519
Is a nonsensical idea coming from people who
are sadistic, who have no joy in themselves.

258
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:08,500
They cannot see you happy.

259
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:20,309
And that’s why also they make Christ look
like a TB patient, I should say.

260
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:30,340
I went to the Sistine Chapel and Michelangelo
was a realized soul, a great person.

261
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:35,179
He has done complete justice to the image
of Christ.

262
00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:44,519
Huge big thing like a, we can say, a Texas
fellow standing with a lambodara, with a big

263
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:46,019
stomach of this kind.

264
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:47,539
Ganesha is lambodara.

265
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:54,799
Standing there throwing people right and left.

266
00:27:54,799 --> 00:28:01,840
Just see the words, how He has spoken.

267
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:08,799
He was not a cabbage like person, He was extremely
dynamic, He was full of vigor, He was absolutely

268
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:09,799
fearless.

269
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:13,190
He had nothing to fear.

270
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:19,470
And He’s standing there and throwing people
to the left and the right and the right ones

271
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:24,090
is accepting them and putting them in the
Kingdom of Heaven.

272
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,090
Just imagine!

273
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:29,899
It is Michelangelo is the only person who
has really done justice to Him and I would

274
00:28:29,899 --> 00:28:33,899
say Rubens because of his habits of painting
the muscles, he’s done a very beautiful

275
00:28:33,899 --> 00:28:40,480
painting, I saw, is in the place where he
lives, of the ascent and descent of Christ.

276
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,090
Beautiful, one of the best one could think.

277
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:48,500
Nowhere miseries written on His face.

278
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,179
Such people do not feel the misery.

279
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:55,159
They just watch the drama.

280
00:28:55,159 --> 00:29:07,909
They don’t suffer because of taking up your
sufferings it took it upon Himself and He

281
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:18,999
showed to the world that: “Now I ask forgiveness
from My Father”.

282
00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:27,129
He stood as a representative of all the seekers
of the world before His Father who is a wrathful

283
00:29:27,129 --> 00:29:28,129
Father.

284
00:29:28,129 --> 00:29:35,169
I told you Shri Krishna has a Samara Shakti
and worse than that is the witness God whom

285
00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:37,770
we call as Sadashiva.

286
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:44,600
He is only there when He has to destroy.

287
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:53,779
And He asks as your representative: “O Father,
please, forgive them”.

288
00:29:53,779 --> 00:30:03,409
He asks for forgiveness, facing His own Father
as your representative that: “Please, forgive

289
00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:04,409
them”.

290
00:30:04,409 --> 00:30:11,019
This is the greatest weapon He has given us,
to forgive.

291
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:19,259
That’s one thing none of the Christian nations
are doing, is to forgive.

292
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:23,379
Perhaps people have not known the power of
love.

293
00:30:23,379 --> 00:30:24,379
They do not.

294
00:30:24,379 --> 00:30:25,379
They talk.

295
00:30:25,379 --> 00:30:26,379
God is love.

296
00:30:26,379 --> 00:30:28,159
Just talk, talk, talk, talk.

297
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:34,090
If God is love then love must be the most
powerful thing.

298
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:45,370
When I first started My work I flouted all
these fake gurus by names in India and I told

299
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:49,450
them what devils they had been and I‘ve
known them for ages.

300
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,419
And people told Me that: “They will shoot
You this time”.

301
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:52,929
I said: “Let them start shooting.

302
00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:55,049
I’ll se who can shoot Me.”

303
00:30:55,049 --> 00:30:58,909
[AND ALL THOSE I HAVE] flouted them anywhere
I get the chance.

304
00:30:58,909 --> 00:31:02,019
I’ve told that: “These are horrible people“.

305
00:31:02,019 --> 00:31:05,230
As Christ has said: “Hot or cold.”

306
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:11,230
He doesn’t mind, because if it is cold they
are realized, if they are hot then we’ll

307
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,230
fight them.

308
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,450
We can tell them how.

309
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:18,830
But if they are one lukewarm, you see, there
are people: “O, we are in different awareness,

310
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:23,809
they are in different awareness, we must accept
this awareness also, we must accept...”

311
00:31:23,809 --> 00:31:29,119
Such people are the ones He said: “I’ll
spout them out of My mouth”.

312
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,169
So clearly.

313
00:31:30,169 --> 00:31:35,240
He’s the One who whipped people who were
selling things in the temple.

314
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,720
He is the One who said: “Don’t throw pearls
before the swine.”

315
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:45,490
So far I’ve never used this word but He
has.

316
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:49,520
He was dynamic.

317
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,509
He was not afraid of anyone.

318
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:57,549
And He couldn’t bear the mediocrity and
this kind of balance: “Oh, we have them

319
00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:00,190
also, we can have the devils and also the
Gods”.

320
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:03,210
People argue: “Why do You criticize them?

321
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:04,940
They don’t criticize You”.

322
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:11,110
He said: “The devil, the Satan is not going
to speak against his own house”.

323
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:14,820
This is exactly what is happening today.

324
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:19,340
I’ve seen when I say that: “This man is
a devil”, people say: “Mother, why do

325
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,720
you call him a devil?”

326
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,760
“Because he’s a devil, I have to call
him a devil.

327
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,480
I’m your Mother.”

328
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:33,309
When I see a person suffering, he cannot get
his Realization because he went to this devil,

329
00:32:33,309 --> 00:32:35,440
I have to say he’s a devil whether you like
it or not.

330
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,830
If you are a true seeker you stand up to that
and see for yourself you are a true seeker.

331
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:47,940
And if you are a true seeker you must find
your Spirit and you must get to your Realization.

332
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,400
I’m not here for any elections or pampering.

333
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:59,519
I’m here to give you your own, to have your
own Spirit, to enjoy your being.

334
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:05,809
Even if the whole world gets against Me, I’m
not bothered about it.

335
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:14,059
I’m here of course to look after you, to
tell you in a proper way.

336
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:22,740
But if it comes to the devils I will be the
One who will stand against them, every minute.

337
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:27,749
Whatever may they come in, whatever guard,
it’s very easy to make them out once you

338
00:33:27,749 --> 00:33:28,809
get your Realization.

339
00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:30,940
It’s very easy to find out.

340
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,330
He Himself has said it all these things.

341
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:35,789
He said: “Don’t judge anyone”.

342
00:33:35,789 --> 00:33:38,200
Before Realization you can’t judge anyone,
from the appearances.

343
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:43,700
They look very sweet, you know, or they talk
very sweetly.

344
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:53,960
They come to you in a band, you see, and they
walk with such beautiful gait.

345
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,130
They are great dramatist, some of them play
tricks, jump like Krishna.

346
00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:00,809
Some say: “We are Incarnation of Christ.”

347
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:07,950
There was a gentleman who said: “I’m the
Incarnation of Krishna”.

348
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:13,820
I told him: “Why do you make the ladies
nude and naked?

349
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:18,750
What religion has taught you this, to make
the ladies nude and naked, take out their

350
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,310
clothes and make them dance?

351
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,310
What is this?”

352
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,880
“O, he said, I’m Shri Krishna!”

353
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,940
I said: “Really?

354
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,410
I never knew Shri Krishna did that.”

355
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:29,170
He said: “No, He did.”

356
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:34,820
Once Krishna was a small child of four years,
you can imagine, a naughty little thing.

357
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,960
What did He understand of nudity or that?

358
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,960
Innocent.

359
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,850
And the gopis, you see, were having their
bath in the river Yamuna where Radha was putting

360
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:47,860
Her feet, so the water was all vibrated.

361
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:56,940
And He climbed up onto a tree and they had
put their clothes on a tree and He hid them.

362
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:00,510
So they were asking for His clothes: “Now
what are you doing?

363
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,700
Why have you hidden?”

364
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,700
It’s a mischief.

365
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,490
It’s the fun.

366
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:07,340
But in that fun what He was doing?

367
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:12,080
Was to give them Realization because He could
see their Kundalini at the back.

368
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,460
[AS, AND] a child of four years...

369
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:18,390
What does a child of four years know about
nudity, or dress or anything?

370
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,390
Innocent.

371
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:23,260
Modern children may be very precautious, but
not in those days.

372
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:27,680
But when He was the king in Dwarika – I
asked this nonsensical fellow who says he

373
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:35,010
is the Bhagavanan, and the Shri Krishna – I
said when He was a grown up man and a king

374
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:42,510
in Dwarika, which is at least two thousand
miles away from Hastinapur Delhi, and a lady

375
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:49,500
called Draupadi, who called Him as a brother,
was troubled because she was pound and all

376
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:56,050
that, a big story of Mahabharata, you might
be knowing Draupadi, and a devil of a man

377
00:35:56,050 --> 00:36:01,350
called Dhuriodhana said that: ” I’ll make
you nude”, tried to pull Her sari.

378
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:06,090
It’s a beautiful description of the whole
thing.

379
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:14,490
He, He was worried that she will lose her
chastity by removing her..., this is called

380
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:16,020
as [SANSKRIT WORD].

381
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:23,312
So she put it in her mouth like this and she
was to call Krishna.

382
00:36:23,312 --> 00:36:28,300
She says: “Kri”, and she was holding because
Krishna means “falls down”.

383
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:35,150
And as soon as she found that the sari is
going, she said: ”shna”, and the description

384
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,200
is so great: “[SANSKRIT TALK]”.

385
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:42,940
When she did that “shna” it echoed in
Dwarika where He was ruling.

386
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,230
He was the king there.

387
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:53,850
And with shanka, chakra, gada, padma, these
are four weapons, one better that the other.

388
00:36:53,850 --> 00:37:03,720
One is sufficient, the chakra, I told you,
all up on to on the Garuda, on the condor

389
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,690
He arrived there to save the chastity of His
sister.

390
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:15,560
If He was fond of removing the clothes of
women, why did He all the way come and save

391
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,560
that?

392
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,920
And this fellow didn’t know how to answer
Me.

393
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,340
I told him: “One day your clothes will be
taken out like this”.

394
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:25,280
Within eight days it happened.

395
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,010
Somebody took out all his clothes and he was
dancing on the street and nowadays he’s

396
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:33,530
backing America with a paralysis.

397
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:38,200
He couldn’t smell flowers.

398
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,190
One better that the other.

399
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:43,590
But his disciples, if you tell them: “O,
don’t say, Mother.

400
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,990
We love him.”

401
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:51,180
This kind of a funny mesmerism it’s stupidity.

402
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,570
Awake yourself!

403
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:59,350
This kind of emotional nonsensical attachment
to one person is not going to give you Realization.

404
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:01,670
You have to become your Spirit.

405
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:12,160
You have to be actually reborn.

406
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,490
There is no place for devilish people.

407
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:21,190
If they are from hell they will go back to
that, but many of their disciples are also

408
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,190
walking through.

409
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:25,770
[WHILE, WHY] they are My children, I would
say?

410
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:37,310
They are the children of God, they are the
men of God, as described as William Blake.

411
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:43,240
They have been born on this earth for seeking
because they know this is the time they are

412
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,980
going to achieve their Realization and these
horrible people have mesmerized them.

413
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:55,280
At this time should I go and garland them
and say: “You are very nice people”?

414
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,290
If you expect Me to do that, then you have
not understood Me at all.

415
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:03,550
No use telling Me: “O, their awareness is
different.”

416
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:09,940
I see that your Kundalini is ruined, you are
up to get a blood cancer or some sort of a

417
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:14,680
cancer or you are going to get into the lunatic
asylum.

418
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:18,520
Something horrible is going to happen to you
and when I see that am I to say “Yes”

419
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,990
the one who has done, go and fall at his feet?

420
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:26,420
But if there’s a real guru I would go and
meet him Myself.

421
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:31,370
There are many, but they are hiding.

422
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:36,750
I sent one fellow to New York, he ran away
within two days, within two days.

423
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:40,110
He said: “O, these New York people are different”.

424
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:42,730
He said: “I have to take a circus with me.

425
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:51,330
They like a circus.”

426
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:54,130
But Houston people are different.

427
00:39:54,130 --> 00:40:04,280
Now, so this was the great Incarnation of
Christ who came on this Earth, a very dynamic.

428
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:11,400
Those who say that: “I’m the Christ”,
there’s many, you see, self certified people:

429
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,930
“I’m the Christ”.

430
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:21,360
Now the kind of a Christ they do, He was never
like that, He was a healthy man and He was

431
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:27,170
not one of these people who’s these cheeks
have gone inside, who looks like a miserable,

432
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:29,220
hungry, pitiable man.

433
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,590
[MISSING RECORDING]

434
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:37,020
[THIS IS] of Holy Ghost, the Kundalini rises.

435
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:42,650
Is written down.

436
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:54,840
There are thousand things written and every
word has to be tallied with that person otherwise

437
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,210
you just don’t believe.

438
00:40:56,210 --> 00:41:13,780
Let them go and walk on the water, is not
far away from you, seventeen miles only, and

439
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:17,630
see how far they go.

440
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,350
Is the best way to judge these people.

441
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:22,410
We have got a method to judge these people.

442
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:28,750
Thank God, we are born in modern times when
we are not [ILLITERATE], we have had Christ,

443
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:35,690
we have had so many people, we can read and
we can understand, we should logically reach

444
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:41,700
the position to understand what do we have
to expect from a Realized Soul.

445
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:48,000
If he talks like a politician who wants to
have votes, how can you believe that such

446
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,160
a person could be an Incarnation?

447
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:58,930
An Incarnation has not only to be a fearless
person, but has to be a holy person.

448
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:02,220
Not the one who is like a parasite living
on other people.

449
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,710
Like these lamas [ARE].

450
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:12,990
They live like parasites in Nepal and also
in Lhasa [UNCLEAR] were suffering.

451
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:23,740
They had no food but these lamas were living
and taking their special Ambrose, they call

452
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:26,450
it, in golden cups.

453
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:30,250
Today they are driven out so they are on our
head in India.

454
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:35,200
We have to support these nonsensical people
sitting down there as lamas, these parasites

455
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,830
of the worst type.

456
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:42,630
And those who could not get a place there
are now moving about and now they want to

457
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:45,480
live on a marble flooring.

458
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,080
They can’t live on a carpet flooring.

459
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,350
They must have a marble flooring.

460
00:42:51,350 --> 00:43:00,270
And people have to starve themselves to create
a marble flooring for these horrible parasites.

461
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:02,800
Why should a saint ask for anything?

462
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,910
A saint is a king.

463
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:08,230
He’s above all these comforts of life.

464
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:09,830
He’s not bothered.

465
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:16,130
I mean, if you ask, I can sleep on the street,
I’ve no problem, no problem, because I’m

466
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:18,950
above the want, I’m above greed.

467
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:23,580
I don’t know what sort of a thing is temptation.

468
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:34,940
If they call themselves as Godly people, look
at their faces, worn out, biscuity, serious,

469
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:35,940
nonsensical people.

470
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:39,500
They have no sense of humor of any kind.

471
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:45,270
Not only but I’ve seen some disciple who
came to Me, all their bone was broken, all

472
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:49,370
their back bone was broken, every bone was
broken by these people.

473
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:52,080
They use to beat them [THESE SADISTS].

474
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:59,380
They take money from you and finish your Kundalini.

475
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:04,210
Their days have come now.

476
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:08,580
Because they talk well don’t believe them.

477
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,960
What have they given you?

478
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,800
Somebody says: “They have given us the knowledge”.

479
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,240
All right, what knowledge?

480
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,010
What knowledge have they given you?

481
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:20,370
Knowledge, is all mental.

482
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:25,770
What have you got it in your awareness, where
you have to evolve, when you rise.

483
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:35,220
Christ has described it so clearly, I did
not say what a Realized soul should be.

484
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:42,890
You become a witness, you become a witness
of the whole drama, of the whole show.

485
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:45,510
And this should happen to you.

486
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:50,130
Not only, but you are empowered with the powers
of your Spirit.

487
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:53,960
At least your health should be all right.

488
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:59,880
People are suffering from stresses and strain,
having a headache all the time, jumping on

489
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,190
their sits and they say: “We get very positive
results”.

490
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:05,900
What are positive results?

491
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:14,310
These make believes if you carry on with them
you will have no way of judging as to where

492
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:15,310
you are.

493
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:19,710
First of all get your Realization.

494
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:27,160
Get to your discretion power and realize that
it is you can judge them after Realization,

495
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,160
not before.

496
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,870
Christ has said “right discretion”.

497
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:34,940
He has used the word: “right discretion”.

498
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:40,600
How do you get “right discretion” unless
and until you are realized?

499
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:45,440
And this is not to be self-certified.

500
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,050
As Christ has said: “You’ll be calling
Me Christ, Christ.

501
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,750
I will not recognize you”.

502
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:51,840
Meaning what?

503
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:58,900
Those who say: “We are Christians”, you
see, going about with the label: “We are

504
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:07,010
Christians, we go to church, sing our hymns
and come back home and quarrel, going to wars,

505
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:08,010
fight.

506
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:12,930
We are the people who drink on a Christmas
day.

507
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:18,210
On a Christmas day, we drink!”

508
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:24,890
Now, when Christ said that, they said at the
time of Christ, He went to a wedding and He

509
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:26,290
blessed the wine.

510
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:27,290
Is not true.

511
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:34,630
That wine, at that time never meant, even
in India today, wine never means an alcohol.

512
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:39,520
But Moses has talked about it very clearly
and Abraham has talked about it because they

513
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:45,880
had to deal with this wine which I told you,
the Primordial Masters, they had to deal with

514
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:52,290
the liver, so they talked about it, they called
it the “strong drink” and “fermented

515
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:56,060
drink”, so clearly.

516
00:46:56,060 --> 00:47:01,000
But everything happens if somebody dies, you
must have champagne to celebrate his death

517
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
perhaps.

518
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,890
If Christ is born we must have champagne.

519
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:12,700
If Christ is born that is the day we should
dedicate ourselves to our Spirit, not to get

520
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:15,570
out of your awareness.

521
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:20,380
Anyone of these fermented things take you
away from your attention.

522
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:24,790
Your attention is in a way empathized.

523
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:26,640
I don’t say: “You don’t drink!”

524
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,700
at this stage but after Realization you will
not.

525
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:32,370
You will not, even if you want to.

526
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:40,490
You will not drink, because you get drunk.

527
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:44,750
Like Me, if I go to a party, you see, they
will always say: “Please, have something.

528
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:45,820
O, You must have, please.

529
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,060
You have not tested this.

530
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:48,290
You better have”.

531
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:50,550
I said: “No, sir, I’m sorry, I’m over
drunk already.

532
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:53,570
If I drink more, I don’t know what will
happen to Me”.

533
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:56,360
I mean you can’t tell them: “You don’t
drink”.

534
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:01,540
You see, that would be absolutely [UNLIARLY]
to tell them: “Please, don’t drink today”.

535
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:05,640
But they’ll go on forcing you and if you
say anything against it then absolutely you

536
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,720
are no eliteness about you.

537
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,810
You are absolutely unsophisticated.

538
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:17,070
This is the thing in this world.

539
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:19,580
Virtue has no meaning.

540
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:22,600
If you are virtuous, you better hide yourself.

541
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,390
Not in Sahaja Yoga.

542
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:27,400
You enjoy your virtues in Sahaja Yoga.

543
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,010
You really enjoy yours and others virtues.

544
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:35,640
Is a very different thing as in the unity
church you call it, a New Age is coming, is

545
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,770
absolutely true.

546
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:48,840
I find, as I told you the principles of this
church are very, very close to that which

547
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:53,040
is the stage on to which you have to jump.

548
00:48:53,040 --> 00:49:03,690
And that’s why the right conclusion that
is reached is absolutely the way to understand

549
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:04,900
where you have to reach logically.

550
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:15,910
But you must know, you have to take a stand.

551
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:23,000
You cannot be a person who’s apologetic.

552
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,610
There is no place for apologies.

553
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:30,090
If you are a realized soul, you are a realized
soul.

554
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:32,860
You are not dominating it by that to anyone.

555
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:34,940
You are not dominating.

556
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:44,370
By that you accept your situation with glory
and with pride.

557
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:52,550
But I’ve seen many Sahaja Yogis also feel
shy to accept that they are realized.

558
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:53,970
They understand what’s happening.

559
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:59,130
They are giggling, they are laughing at the
way people are, but they find it impossible

560
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:05,330
to talk to them about their Realization, that
other should get their Realization.

561
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:12,450
You have to take a stand in your family, in
your surroundings, with your friends and you

562
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:18,230
have to tell them that: “You better all
get realized”.

563
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:25,730
The reason for that is that the Christ who
crucified Himself, He is going to come back,

564
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:32,720
with his eleven forces of destruction.

565
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:39,180
And then He’s not going to tell you anything,
not going to ask you to take any Realization,

566
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:44,260
nor He is bothered whether you go to hell.

567
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:49,810
He will just sort out.

568
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:57,360
But those who have got Realization will enter
into the Kingdom of God.

569
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,580
You have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

570
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:04,180
Here, as I say, is the seventh chakra.

571
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:12,950
I told you about the sixth chakra, which is
adorned by Jesus Christ and the mantra of

572
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:18,510
the (seventh chakra), sixth chakra is our
Lord’s Prayer.

573
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:21,690
That’s the way you can solve both the things.

574
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:26,780
But the bija mantra is Ham Ksham.

575
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:28,720
Ham Ksham.

576
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:39,350
It means that when you are infested with negativity,
with depression, with the attack of the superego,

577
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:46,350
as shown here, then you have to say: “I
am, I’m going to fight you”.

578
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:53,080
If you go to a guru who makes you a negative
person, who makes you feel very shy, who says:

579
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:58,730
“You are all the ego and you are good for
nothing, you must pay me more and pay me more”.

580
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:02,450
And you all the time say that: “Oh, must
be something wrong with me, nothing wrong

581
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:05,600
with this man”.

582
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:12,670
If there is self-pity and also there is guilt,
then you have to say: “I am not guilty”.

583
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:18,450
Then you have to say that: “I’m my own
guru”, if you have left side problems.

584
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:25,620
But if you have right side problems, then
you have to say: “I forgive, Ham Ksham”.

585
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:33,260
These are the bija mantras of this two, which
you have got, your symbol is of these two

586
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:35,860
wings, is actually the Agya chakra.

587
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:38,520
It is just like that.

588
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:41,710
Agya chakra is just like that.

589
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:43,800
But they call it the, what Egyptian, what...

590
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,540
no, is not that.

591
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:52,730
You see, this symbol has come to you from
unconscious, is the Agya chakra, is this center.

592
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:58,320
Egyptians didn’t know much about God, I
must tell you.

593
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:02,840
Of course pyramid is, pyramid is, pyramid
is all vibrated.

594
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:07,310
But the way they were so much worried about
their dead is horrifying.

595
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:14,911
Imagine these bones buried in the one box
of gold, then one box of silver, then one

596
00:53:14,911 --> 00:53:18,150
box of this and all the ornaments kept with
the dead.

597
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:20,720
The dead is finished into bones, the ornaments
are there.

598
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,430
I’ve seen that in Egypt.

599
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:26,140
Mad people, I must say.

600
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:29,760
It’s Sadat who would have brought it round.

601
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:34,360
But lets see something new will happen there,
in that country.

602
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:40,290
Traditional countries have wisdom, inbuilt
wisdom and they go on improving because they

603
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:43,310
have tried all these methods and they know
[WHERE TO GO].

604
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:44,700
He didn’t talk of death.

605
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:50,190
They know it from the people, pharaohs and
all that who had all these kinds of a funny

606
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:58,370
mummies going round and keeping the dead in
a silver box and as if the dead knows where

607
00:53:58,370 --> 00:53:59,790
is the silver.

608
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:02,860
Christ has said many things, which we do not
pay attention to.

609
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:07,140
[NONE, ONE] of them is about the dead.

610
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:15,040
In every church, I was happy to know that
in this church there is no cemetery.

611
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,531
You walk into a cemetery if you want to go
to a church.

612
00:54:18,531 --> 00:54:23,070
A lady who came from India, she said: “Everything
seems to be upside down in England”.

613
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:24,070
I said: “What?”

614
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:26,160
She said: “I went to see a church.

615
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,270
And all the dead were laid there under my
feet.

616
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:31,190
And I was holding my sari walking like this.

617
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:33,650
I was thinking I was going to step.

618
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:35,930
And the lady with me said: ‘What, you should
walk straight‘.

619
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:38,040
She said: ‘How can I, you see?

620
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,240
These are dead here.

621
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,450
It’s like a cemetery.”

622
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:43,840
And she was walking carefully because they
must be respected.

623
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:46,030
You take your children to those churches.

624
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:56,000
I mean I don’t know, you don’t understand
that God has talked about spirits in so clear

625
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
ways.

626
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,430
Of course, maybe it’s not so much in the
Bible, maybe, but He showed that He took out

627
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:08,850
the spirits, He talked of spirits of so many
people, and put them in the pigs and put them

628
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:09,880
in the sea.

629
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:16,490
All this is so clearly given, still, just
see the Christian nations.

630
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:28,490
Today’s newspaper, was there one free newspaper,
witchcraft, devils [TEN], devils angels, this

631
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:37,690
guru, that guru, psychic, ESP, all kinds of
spirits.

632
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:38,770
Imagine!

633
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:42,102
I mean in Indian picture you won’t even
find one advertisement like that.

634
00:55:42,102 --> 00:55:51,890
Maybe some of the gurus might try, but in
India people know who is real and who is not.

635
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:54,690
Most of them know.

636
00:55:54,690 --> 00:56:03,210
While here I find all kinds of things, which
are negative, which have something to do with

637
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:04,760
the spirits we are doing.

638
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,600
It is against Christ.

639
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:11,700
Why should we bother ourselves about the spirits?

640
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:15,010
Let them alone.

641
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:18,230
Like somebody’s father is haunting, somebody’s
mother is haunting.

642
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:20,640
Now, there’ve been so much for you!

643
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,670
Now forget them.

644
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:25,780
Let them be born again to get their Realization.

645
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:29,930
Then you call somebody’s spirit here, somebody’s
spirit from dead.

646
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:37,130
Some spiritualist goes into a funny gesture
and you start believing that and asking about

647
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:38,770
your future and this and that.

648
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:43,880
Is all very superfluous and absolutely silly
against your Spirit.

649
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:49,400
I’ve told you yesterday, those people who
indulge into these, for seven generations

650
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,320
they suffer, seven generations.

651
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:56,950
I’m telling you from My experience.

652
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:59,710
And those who go to them also suffer.

653
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:02,480
Even the countries where this is practiced
too much.

654
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:09,410
If a child is born there, I know of a lady
whose child was born in a country like that,

655
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:13,590
and he had this Agya protruding just like
this.

656
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:19,000
And when he saw Me, he started screaming and
shouting, he couldn’t bear Me.

657
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,100
And today he’s a different child, I saw.

658
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:26,470
He’s a French child, he’s a very different
child.

659
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:28,310
Absolutely.

660
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:32,580
But he was so much and so many spirits in
him, you can’t imagine.

661
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:37,810
And she told Me that she, she had a nurse
who was form that country and perhaps she

662
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:40,220
has done something to him.

663
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:43,810
So the source of this is already unlimited.

664
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:46,000
You don’t have to pay for it.

665
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,070
You stand outside and you can get anyone of
them.

666
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:52,910
It’s very easy to catch on them, very easy.

667
00:57:52,910 --> 00:57:55,950
For example, somebody asked Me: “How do
you catch a spirit?”

668
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:56,950
I said: “Very simple.

669
00:57:56,950 --> 00:58:03,840
You put a light before you, of course you
don’t try on that stick, and make a whole

670
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,300
in a black paper, little hole.

671
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:12,340
And through that hole you see the spirit.

672
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:17,530
You see that light and you’ll get a spirit
into you.

673
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:23,820
You get any name, which is commonly used and
go on and chanting that name, you’ll get

674
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:26,620
into a spirit.

675
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:33,660
You start saying any absurd thing in the presence
of God, in the presence of the picture of

676
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:39,610
God or of Christ, you insult or do anything
you get into it.

677
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:46,700
It is the easiest thing to get a spirit in
you.

678
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:51,260
You start jumping too much, you get it, you
start saying: “Hooo”.

679
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:53,080
You get it.

680
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,610
You do any funny thing, you get them.

681
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:57,330
They are all around.

682
00:58:57,330 --> 00:59:02,220
They are busy bodies.

683
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:03,880
They want to use you for their purpose.

684
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,750
They are very easy available.

685
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:09,520
Why do you pay for them?

686
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:13,520
Will you pay such a lot of amount just to
get one of them on top of you?

687
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:21,430
You 
have to be your master, I told you.

688
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:29,090
You have to be in the way Christ was.

689
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:37,830
It’s only He has the power to raise the
Kundalini of people like that, as you do now.

690
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:45,530
He was created in that immaculate way in which
you have been given Realization, in the same

691
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:47,850
immaculate manner.

692
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:48,980
So have your self-esteem.

693
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:57,560
You are not going to become slave of these
horrible useless sly aggressive people, who

694
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:02,270
are hanging around just to trouble you because
their ambitions are not fulfilled or they

695
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:09,140
are sly or they are sadists, or they are masochists
and all that kind of thing.

696
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:11,750
You are seekers, of high quality.

697
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:13,520
Rise up to your Self.

698
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:20,980
This is the message of Christ to you, because
He resurrected Himself.

699
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:26,880
Did you dance or did you say Hu hu, haa?

700
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,900
Even He was tempted by Satan.

701
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:33,740
And invited the Satan arrive there, and invited.

702
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:39,060
Nobody asked him to be there.

703
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:41,710
He has fasted for you, so you don’t fast.

704
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:46,370
If you fast, you’ll get a fasting spirit
in you.

705
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:51,140
If you overdo your Hatha yoga you’ll get
a spirit, which will do much more Hatha yoga

706
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:52,620
till your ribs break out.

707
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:53,620
Yeah.

708
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:56,070
They take you to extremes, you see.

709
01:00:56,070 --> 01:01:00,560
You see those mad people running, jogging
on the road.

710
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:06,960
They will get it very soon.

711
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:11,140
I am worried about them.

712
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:13,170
You see, all these extra things, there is
no need to do.

713
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:20,210
Today we saw one of the circus or some sort
of thing that was there, they were three people

714
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:22,790
from somewhere, I think from Spain and [ALL
THAT].

715
01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:25,280
And the Vishuddhi was so badly catching in
them.

716
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,600
Poor things were putting all the pressure,
going like this, going like that.

717
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:31,010
And they said they are statues, whatever it
is.

718
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:33,290
I said, I had simple pity for them.

719
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:35,040
I said: “What are they up to?”

720
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:38,150
I mean, you can have real statues like that.

721
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:44,310
But why make human beings behave so funny,
so extra energy consumers?

722
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:45,310
Why?

723
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:46,310
Why?

724
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:53,380
You are human beings, you are delicate things.

725
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:56,200
Why do you want to stand on your heads?

726
01:01:56,200 --> 01:02:00,800
Why do you want to do something that you are
not supposed to do?

727
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:10,880
You have to stay in the central path, in a
sensible way, in a very normal way, to get

728
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:11,890
your Realization.

729
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:15,600
We’ll not do anything that is extreme.

730
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:16,600
Always avoid extremes.

731
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:17,800
But you tell something to someone.

732
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:18,940
Is impossible.

733
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:25,810
Human beings must start doing it.

734
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:30,520
You give him a cycle, till he breaks his head,
he will not give up his cycle.

735
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:36,420
You give them the skates, till he completely
is in an accident, he won’t give up his

736
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,420
skates.

737
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:40,490
It’s impossible to deal with them.

738
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:44,140
To be in the centre is the easiest thing.

739
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:48,620
Just to be in the center, in the balance.

740
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:53,810
Before going to the Sahasrara, I want to tell
you about the balancing, because tomorrow

741
01:02:53,810 --> 01:02:56,750
I’m going to tell you how the diseases are
caused.

742
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:58,130
So the balance is...

743
01:02:58,130 --> 01:03:06,040
Because if you use anyone of these powers,
for the first power is of superego, through

744
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:10,870
which we run away from places, we avoid, we
are frightened, we have fears.

745
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:15,880
The another is of aggression, right hand side,
is the ego.

746
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:19,900
Anyone of them if you use too much, the other
one gets frozen.

747
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:25,530
For example, a person who thinks too much
and plans too much and thinks that he is responsible

748
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:29,920
for the whole world of affairs, you see, and
he is doing all the work, while he doesn’t

749
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:30,920
do anything, God does everything.

750
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:38,510
In the myth that he is, develops his ego to
a great extent by which his left side suffers

751
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:39,510
too much.

752
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:48,690
And then, first thing he develops is all the
problems of the left side in the organ.

753
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:53,830
First of all, the poor Swadhishthana cannot
look after the liver so he develops a liver,

754
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:59,970
then on the left hand side it is absolutely
useless, so he develops diabetes.

755
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:05,090
Diabetes is not caused by sugar by any chance,
I can tell you.

756
01:04:05,090 --> 01:04:07,690
Of course, you should not take too much sugar,
also.

757
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:09,610
I mean, too much of everything is wrong.

758
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:10,640
But you must take sugar.

759
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:13,230
Is important for your liver to have your sugar
diet.

760
01:04:13,230 --> 01:04:18,070
But it’s the idea in the head that if you
take sugar you get diabetes.

761
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:20,100
Not at all.

762
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:26,060
It is caused by over thinking.

763
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:27,300
Absolutely.

764
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:28,300
Not by sugar.

765
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:35,810
In an Indian village, a farmer takes at least
every day half a kilo of sugar, for your information.

766
01:04:35,810 --> 01:04:41,590
And they do not know what diabetes is because
he doesn’t think.

767
01:04:41,590 --> 01:04:47,220
He just does.

768
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:54,640
If you want to solve your problem of diabetes,
you have to develop your thoughtless awareness,

769
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,530
which you get when Christ is awakened within
you.

770
01:04:57,530 --> 01:04:59,180
He thinks for you.

771
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:02,050
You don’t have to think.

772
01:05:02,050 --> 01:05:04,940
You just be in that silence, that bliss.

773
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:09,660
And then Swadhishthana can look after the
other side.

774
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:14,000
Diabetes is absolutely curable through Sahaja
Yoga.

775
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:23,670
Then people who suffer from the troubles of
the spleen, like anemia and all those things.

776
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:25,430
But the worst of all is the blood cancer.

777
01:05:25,430 --> 01:05:29,970
Blood cancer is the worst thing you suffer
from spleen.

778
01:05:29,970 --> 01:05:31,820
Now, how it is caused?

779
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:38,960
A person who’s very busy, you see, is big
man, he has no time.

780
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:45,060
So he gets out of his bed, puts on his trousers
and he is there for the breakfast, standing

781
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:47,170
he’s eating something.

782
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:48,580
All right.

783
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:53,360
Poor this spleen is trying to cooperate that
emergency, is trying to give some blood.

784
01:05:53,360 --> 01:06:00,530
Suddenly he jumps into his car, he’s driving,
he goes and meets other who are on the way,

785
01:06:00,530 --> 01:06:04,750
have jammed this way, so he’s cursing them,
doing all kind of things.

786
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:06,780
He is very speedy, you see.

787
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:11,200
He must go and he can’t bear that jam.

788
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:17,600
This speediness comes to you because this
spleen becomes mad.

789
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:18,630
It becomes crazy.

790
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:23,280
It doesn’t know how to cope with the man
like that.

791
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:27,220
He has no time to sit down and eat.

792
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:33,720
Formerly, in India, the husband, of course
our system is rather different, which the

793
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:38,920
American women won’t like, but we have been
very successful with our methods, you see.

794
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:45,610
It’s a trick I will tell you.

795
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:49,220
The women must know cooking in India.

796
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:50,760
They might be the richest of rich.

797
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:52,420
They must know cooking.

798
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:54,580
They know very good cooking, excellent.

799
01:06:54,580 --> 01:07:00,620
You know, you approach your man through his
stomach, always is true.

800
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:01,630
Hundred percent.

801
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:05,510
And then they make the husband sit down comfortably.

802
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:10,600
In India, we sit on, I mean we have a kind
of a – what you call a [HINDI WORD], we

803
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:15,400
can say a stool which is very low and the
husband sits there and another stool in front

804
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,400
of him.

805
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:20,000
And she sits there with a fan, you see, she’s
fanning him.

806
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
The rhythm of the food is with the fan.

807
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:28,250
And she serves him and she looks after him,
and she talks to him very sweetly at that

808
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:31,130
time when he eats his food.

809
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:40,810
That’s the sign of a Gruha Lakshmi, of the,
of the, what is, the Goddess of the family.

810
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:44,310
She’s very kind to him, then he likes those
relaxed moments.

811
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:45,310
She feeds him.

812
01:07:45,310 --> 01:07:50,550
Then he gets up and dresses up and goes to
his work.

813
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:57,580
This kind of peace we should give to our husbands,
if you have to control them.

814
01:07:57,580 --> 01:08:07,500
You have not to compete with them always they
are like children, I tell you.

815
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:10,880
They are so sweet.

816
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:16,840
Somebody told Me: “Mother, you must go and
describe your self esteem, Mother of women”.

817
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:19,070
I said: “What?”

818
01:08:19,070 --> 01:08:23,380
“Yes, there are many women who are expecting
their Mother Goddess to come.”

819
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:28,960
I said: “But I’m sorry, I’m Mother of
men as well as of women.

820
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:36,130
For Me both of them are just the same, two
chariot’s, the two wheels of a chariot.

821
01:08:36,130 --> 01:08:38,850
One is on the left, another in the right”.

822
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:42,580
Is great thing to be a woman, I must say.

823
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:47,450
Like this Mother Earth, she bears us because
she’s so powerful.

824
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:51,370
If you are a powerful person you can bear
it up.

825
01:08:51,370 --> 01:08:54,930
For example, husband has to get angry with
you sometimes.

826
01:08:54,930 --> 01:09:01,929
If he gets angry with somebody in the office,
he loses his job, he’ll be fired.

827
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:05,700
But if he sometimes gets angry with you, it’s
all right.

828
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:06,700
Doesn’t matter.

829
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:07,700
It’s just fun.

830
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:14,920
But a woman has to be that playful, that cheerful
and that understanding should be in a woman.

831
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:17,400
What is there to compete with them?

832
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:21,140
You are the power, the potential.

833
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:24,120
You have to give that power of love to your
husbands.

834
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:28,950
In Sahaja yoga we have changed the entire
system of society, also.

835
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:34,830
It’s such a beautiful relationship between
husband and wife, such a beautiful one among

836
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:35,960
children and parents and....

837
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:38,390
It’s so beautiful, you can’t imagine.

838
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:42,509
That age has to come.

839
01:09:42,509 --> 01:09:45,830
We are not to fight for any rights, we have
every rights.

840
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:48,660
A woman has every right within herself.

841
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:50,440
She doesn’t know how to handle it.

842
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:51,620
And they have gone crazy.

843
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:55,090
They don’t know what to do with these men.

844
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:58,290
It’s very easy to handle them.

845
01:09:58,290 --> 01:10:04,640
You have to learn the art of expressing your
love.

846
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,840
That’s the thing we lack.

847
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:13,570
We should come from your heart to understand
that we can’t live without each other.

848
01:10:13,570 --> 01:10:18,350
This will stop many things that are going
wrong in this country and the injustice we

849
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:23,420
are doing to the children who are born to
us.

850
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:30,020
Now this is I am saying because Christ has
blessed marriage.

851
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:34,420
Those who believe in nunneries and all that
are really nonsensical.

852
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:37,470
And the nuns getting married to this innocence?

853
01:10:37,470 --> 01:10:41,780
I mean, how can innocence marry?

854
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:45,670
This is the worst thing you can do to Christ
is to say that: “This nun is married to

855
01:10:45,670 --> 01:10:46,670
Christ”.

856
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:49,440
I just can’t bear the idea.

857
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:53,680
Is absurd, is an insult of innocence.

858
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:59,000
And this is what it is, we should understand,
that marriage is blessed by Him.

859
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Is a sacred thing.

860
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,340
We should not make a mess out of it.

861
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:08,470
Is so pure.

862
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:10,610
Is very beautiful.

863
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:18,370
You enjoy each other in company, also in separation
you do enjoy.

864
01:11:18,370 --> 01:11:23,640
If you know how to be sweet to each other,
is so beautiful.

865
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:25,540
It’s very beautiful.

866
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:28,850
These traditions will come back as soon as
you become the Spirit.

867
01:11:28,850 --> 01:11:30,530
I’m sure of it.

868
01:11:30,530 --> 01:11:40,320
Now, so we come, I told you about the imbalances
to a great extend, but later on tomorrow also

869
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:44,440
I‘m going to tell you because Sahaja Yogis
have to look after their imbalances to keep

870
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:50,060
their health all right and to look after the
health of other people also.

871
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:56,460
Now about the tenth chakra, the last chakra
as called the seventh chakra, seventh chakra,

872
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:59,230
which is very important.

873
01:11:59,230 --> 01:12:06,920
This chakra has got all these seven centers
in it.

874
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:12,170
It is placed in the brain.

875
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:18,060
The brain, if you have a transverse section
of that, you can see it looks like a lotus

876
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:19,060
leaves.

877
01:12:19,060 --> 01:12:29,400
It is said there are one thousand nerves,
or one thousand centers or plexuses for this

878
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:33,580
particular center called as Sahasrara.

879
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:37,020
Sahasrara means one thousand petals.

880
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,840
And these petals are shown there.

881
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:45,941
Of course they are not one thousand there,
but they look like living flames of different

882
01:12:45,941 --> 01:12:46,941
colors.

883
01:12:46,941 --> 01:12:50,250
“I will appear before you like tongues of
flames.”

884
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:51,250
It’s said.

885
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:58,720
Even the other centers look like tongues of
flames, you see, the flames were enlighten.

886
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:03,040
But the living flames are very silent.

887
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:09,380
They are placed as a lotus and as the Kundalini
comes up She pushes this lotus out and you

888
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:20,110
touch the seat of the Spirit, which is on
top of your head and you enter into the super

889
01:13:20,110 --> 01:13:21,820
consciousness.

890
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:26,940
Not into the collective subconscious or not
into the collective supraconscious, but into

891
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:31,870
the super consciousness, where you become
the master, you become the Spirit.

892
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:36,570
And you start feeling the All Pervading Power
around you.

893
01:13:36,570 --> 01:13:43,750
And through your fontanel bone area you feel
the cool breeze, you actually feel it.

894
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:46,610
It’s an actualization.

895
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:55,910
It is not just that I baptized you, you are
being baptized, it is not possible.

896
01:13:55,910 --> 01:14:02,300
On the contrary, I’ve seen some people who
touch the fontanel bone area of the children

897
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:04,280
introduce spirits.

898
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,720
Yes.

899
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:14,540
It should be done only by a Realized soul
and not by every Dick, Tom and Harry.

900
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:17,130
Is a very dangerous thing.

901
01:14:17,130 --> 01:14:24,190
Now, this Sahasrara has got all the seven
centers, the seats of all the seven centers

902
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:25,240
are there.

903
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:29,450
Start from here is the Agya chakra.

904
01:14:29,450 --> 01:14:32,190
Here is the Vishuddhi.

905
01:14:32,190 --> 01:14:35,430
Then here is the Heart.

906
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:38,580
Now see, it’s so simple.

907
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:39,580
Heart.

908
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:46,780
If it is not heart felt, if you have not felt
it from your heart...

909
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:49,320
Because some people come from other gurus,
I’ve seen them.

910
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:54,680
They sit here just to mock and laugh at it
and make fun of it.

911
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:57,810
They never get Realization.

912
01:14:57,810 --> 01:15:01,900
If your heart is caught up with your ego,
also is difficult.

913
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:09,960
If your heart is weak, maybe any problem with
the heart, it can be anything, I mean, so

914
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:13,010
the Realization here stops.

915
01:15:13,010 --> 01:15:18,400
Heart has to be strong, you have to have a
heart felt desire.

916
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:21,950
That’s the center here of the heart.

917
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:29,990
So I told you this is the center here of the
Agya chakra, Vishuddhi chakra.

918
01:15:29,990 --> 01:15:35,280
This is the center is the, is the, we can
say, a [SATELLITE, SUBTLE OF IT], of the Agya

919
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:40,540
chakra between the two, because here these
two also come out a little bit, the Ha Tha,

920
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:43,710
both of them come out here, down below.

921
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:45,110
It’s Hamsa.

922
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:53,670
But main chakra is this Agya and then there
is the center of Vishuddhi, then here is the

923
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:54,900
center of Heart.

924
01:15:54,900 --> 01:16:03,210
Now, behind here, is the center of Mooladhara,
here, just in the center.

925
01:16:03,210 --> 01:16:09,250
For example today I met a lady who told Me
she’s loosing her eyesight.

926
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:11,580
It could be due to two things only.

927
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:21,600
It could be due to diabetes or it could be
due to some possession you can lose you eyesight.

928
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:24,920
Now, if it is in the center, it is a possession.

929
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:30,570
But diabetes is caused by the Swadhishthana
chakra around it.

930
01:16:30,570 --> 01:16:39,190
So even if it is due to diabetes it can constrict
the optic globe by which you can have problem

931
01:16:39,190 --> 01:16:40,190
on your eyesight.

932
01:16:40,190 --> 01:16:43,490
Your eyes will be open, but suddenly you can’t
see anything.

933
01:16:43,490 --> 01:16:46,150
This is absolutely curable, absolutely curable.

934
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:50,820
Spirits, they get to it.

935
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:56,430
How much we have to be careful about spirits
that you will realize very soon, as soon as

936
01:16:56,430 --> 01:16:58,980
you will take to Sahaja yoga.

937
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:12,270
So the center here of the Agya is caught up
and when it is caught up it just makes the

938
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:16,640
optic globe ineffective and you can’t see.

939
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:20,560
Your eyes are open, you can’t see.

940
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:26,460
And when this diabetes is setting this center
around which is the Swadhishthana chakra,

941
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:28,130
gets affected.

942
01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:33,140
Vishuddhi chakra is here, is here.

943
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:35,630
I mean Nabhi chakra, is here.

944
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:40,510
This is Nabhi chakra, which has got left and
right.

945
01:17:40,510 --> 01:17:50,780
So all these centers are in 
the brain, so the essence of Sahasrara is

946
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:58,690
integration, unity, complete integration.

947
01:17:58,690 --> 01:18:01,620
You cannot integrate nonsensical things together.

948
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:14,450
Integration is only possible of the people
who are of the same style, or of the Deities

949
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:18,579
who stand for God.

950
01:18:18,579 --> 01:18:25,440
You cannot have satanic people and Godly people
integrated, can you?

951
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:26,880
You cannot unite these people.

952
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:29,380
You try it and you’ll have problem.

953
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:33,570
That’s the best way you see the destruction
of every unity.

954
01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:41,770
So in Sanskrit is a very good, good word got
for integration, Samagra, beautiful word which

955
01:18:41,770 --> 01:18:56,680
means, Agra is the, Agra is the hole in the
needle, and when a thread passes through this

956
01:18:56,680 --> 01:19:02,370
needles, it passes through the Agra, so it
is Samagra.

957
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:08,090
And this integration has to take place as
soon as you cross over.

958
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:16,460
And because of this you get your Realization
and you feel all the chakras are enlightened.

959
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:24,770
Unless and until you pass through this fontanel
area you cannot feel the All Pervading Power.

960
01:19:24,770 --> 01:19:31,220
With awakening only, with the awakening of
the Kundalini, you can give Realization even

961
01:19:31,220 --> 01:19:34,910
to people, you may think, but it won’t stay
there.

962
01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:38,940
But, of course, you can cure people, all right.

963
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:46,230
But with Realization, if you establish yourself,
which I’ll tell you how to do it tomorrow,

964
01:19:46,230 --> 01:19:55,290
then you can give Realizations to others,
you can manifest all your powers, even you

965
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:58,510
can control the element, for your information.

966
01:19:58,510 --> 01:20:00,380
Yes, after some time.

967
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:02,490
We have some people in India.

968
01:20:02,490 --> 01:20:09,130
There’s an ordinary fisherman, again a fisherman,
he is educated, he’s a graduated, but he’s

969
01:20:09,130 --> 01:20:10,210
a fisherman.

970
01:20:10,210 --> 01:20:12,270
His name is Harish Chandra.

971
01:20:12,270 --> 01:20:13,770
He’s a Realized soul.

972
01:20:13,770 --> 01:20:15,790
He got his Realization.

973
01:20:15,790 --> 01:20:20,270
He said: “Mother, I never knew you have
given me so many powers.”

974
01:20:20,270 --> 01:20:21,320
I said: “Really?

975
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:22,320
What happened?”

976
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:34,750
He said: “I was going to a village across
to another island and the whole area was covered

977
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:39,780
with clouds in such a way that a tempest was
expected, absolutely, horrible.

978
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:41,880
And people said: ’Don’t go out’”.

979
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:49,190
He said: “I was so much frustrated, I just
stood up there and I said: ‘Now see, I’m

980
01:20:49,190 --> 01:20:50,600
going for God’s work.

981
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:54,130
And will you, please, behave yourself till
I come back?’”.

982
01:20:54,130 --> 01:20:56,600
And he said: “The clouds were removed.

983
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:02,340
Went there and came back, when I reached my
home in the night, that time it started raining”

984
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:05,400
and there were 25 people other fishermen with
him.

985
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:14,270
In India the work is taking up a big form,
among the villagers, among the people who

986
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:17,060
are simple.

987
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:18,500
You do not lack behind.

988
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:25,350
Though they are simple people, they are good
people.

989
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:34,380
You are the leaders, you are great saints,
you have been seeking for ages and now the

990
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:37,510
time has come for you to get it.

991
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:39,670
So do not miss it.

992
01:21:39,670 --> 01:21:44,420
For anybody’s sake, do not plead for any
gurus or anyone.

993
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:46,260
You just plead for yourself.

994
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:50,080
You have paid them, finish it off.

995
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,720
Done your duty.

996
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:53,900
It was a mistake.

997
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:55,000
Forget it.

998
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,970
Get your Realization.

999
01:21:56,970 --> 01:22:00,480
Get to your Spirit.

1000
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:12,120
The Sahasrara is opened out, is opened out
because of this Sahaja yoga has become a mass

1001
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,630
movement now.

1002
01:22:13,630 --> 01:22:16,650
Thousands can get Realization.

1003
01:22:16,650 --> 01:22:17,650
Thousands.

1004
01:22:17,650 --> 01:22:21,460
They have been thousand people, six thousand
people, as he says this, that’s true.

1005
01:22:21,460 --> 01:22:22,460
It is true.

1006
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:23,460
It is true.

1007
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:25,140
It has happened.

1008
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:27,360
It’s so miraculous.

1009
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:30,340
But you are miraculous you are great.

1010
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:34,000
Just to find out yourself, what a great instrument
you are.

1011
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:39,420
You’ll be amazed what things you can do.

1012
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:45,120
I can write a chapter like a book on Sahasrara,
because that’s My place.

1013
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,360
I know it so well.

1014
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:58,520
But today I think that is sufficient and later
on I hope you might be able to get the books

1015
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:05,560
on this, maybe tomorrow, and then you might
be able to read about it.

1016
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:09,790
But first get your Realization, because without
Realization if you read you’ll again become

1017
01:23:09,790 --> 01:23:13,150
a scholar good for nothing.

1018
01:23:13,150 --> 01:23:18,170
That’s why we don’t sell our books to
people who are not realized.

1019
01:23:18,170 --> 01:23:23,830
We just don’t, because they become scholars,
you see.

1020
01:23:23,830 --> 01:23:25,590
They start writing another book.

1021
01:23:25,590 --> 01:23:28,230
I mean people are so funny.

1022
01:23:28,230 --> 01:23:29,550
What’s the use?

1023
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:39,470
Christ has said: “Now, if you want gold,
all right, have it, but be zealous.

1024
01:23:39,470 --> 01:23:44,850
I eat with those who enter into the Kingdom
of God”.

1025
01:23:44,850 --> 01:23:52,540
Take to the Kingdom of God and do not worry
about your intellectual feeds.

1026
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:53,540
You’ve had enough of it.

1027
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:54,540
Take to it.

1028
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:55,540
May God bless you all.

1029
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:59,010
Now today, if you have some questions, you
may ask but I think we should go in [UNCLEAR]

1030
01:23:59,010 --> 01:24:15,090
experience, but if you have questions and
if you are not representing any guru, then

1031
01:24:15,090 --> 01:24:16,290
please ask.

1032
01:24:16,290 --> 01:24:22,330
I don’t want to talking, answering [IN CONTROVERSY,
QUESTIONS ABOUT]….

1033
01:24:22,330 --> 01:24:30,460
I’ve already told you about them and I do
not want to hear anything about these horrible

1034
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:31,460
people.

1035
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:36,880
You know, yesterday somebody argued about
Yogananda.

1036
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:41,580
And this lady [UNCLEAR]: “O God, it’s
feeling hot.

1037
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:43,420
The certificate is there.”

1038
01:24:43,420 --> 01:24:49,390
All right, if you have to ask questions, do
not be aggressive and just get your Realization.

1039
01:24:49,390 --> 01:24:52,620
That’s the main thing you should have.

1040
01:24:52,620 --> 01:25:00,290
Question: I’d like to know if Mother is
a vegetarian.

1041
01:25:00,290 --> 01:25:07,430
Shri Mataji: No, not at all.

1042
01:25:07,430 --> 01:25:16,220
So, supposing I was Kali once upon a time,
I had to drink the blood of these horrible

1043
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:17,220
devils.

1044
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:20,810
How could I be a vegetarian?

1045
01:25:20,810 --> 01:25:24,970
Krishna was not a vegetarian, Rama was not
a vegetarian.

1046
01:25:24,970 --> 01:25:30,930
Don’t become vegetarians, I cannot save
chickens and I cannot give them Realization.

1047
01:25:30,930 --> 01:25:34,420
That doesn’t mean that you all the time
eat meat, meat, meat.

1048
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:36,550
Also doesn’t mean all the time think of
food.

1049
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:38,530
You see, I’m not bothered what I eat.

1050
01:25:38,530 --> 01:25:42,460
If you ask Me what I ate in the morning, I
don’t know.

1051
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:46,080
There’s no fuss about food.

1052
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:48,420
I’m not a vegetarian.

1053
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:50,240
How could I be?

1054
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:57,750
Hindu Indians know that, that Mother can’t
be a vegetarian.

1055
01:25:57,750 --> 01:26:03,340
Krishna could not be because He had to kill
so many people.

1056
01:26:03,340 --> 01:26:04,340
And you should not be.

1057
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:08,220
By becoming vegetarian you won’t reach to
God, I can tell you.

1058
01:26:08,220 --> 01:26:15,560
On the contrary, you catch on the left Nabhi
if you become these horrible vegetarians like

1059
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:17,510
the Jains we have in India.

1060
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:20,130
Jains, have you heard about them, Jains?

1061
01:26:20,130 --> 01:26:30,540
They try to save even the mosquitoes and 
the bugs.

1062
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:34,970
Now, I can’t do, I can’t do anything about
mosquitoes and bugs.

1063
01:26:34,970 --> 01:26:41,620
[I MEAN IT HAS GONE, AND WE CAN GO] to that
absurd, you [KNOW, SAW]?

1064
01:26:41,620 --> 01:26:49,590
Those who talked about it, you read in the
book, where Buddha and Mahavira, they couldn’t

1065
01:26:49,590 --> 01:26:52,500
bear the way people were stupid.

1066
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:57,941
So they were born again as Hassan and Hussein,
the grandchildren of Mohammad Saab and they

1067
01:26:57,941 --> 01:27:29,090
fought in Karbala to show that when it comes
to fighting you have 

1068
01:27:29,090 --> 01:27:30,090
to fight.

1069
01:27:30,090 --> 01:27:33,700
So, onward Christian soldiers.

1070
01:27:33,700 --> 01:28:49,500
Question: Mother [UNCLEAR] when you give somebody

1071
01:28:49,500 --> 01:30:25,730
a blessing, or when You say: “I am [UNCLEAR],
I am [LOVE, NARADA], what do you come to [UNCLEAR]

1072
01:30:25,730 --> 01:30:27,500
on you.

1073
01:30:27,500 --> 01:31:00,730
Shri Mataji: I don’t say that, did I?

1074
01:31:00,730 --> 01:57:05,960
[MISSING FROM RECORDED SPEECH]
