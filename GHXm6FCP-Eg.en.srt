1
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:06,954
I could not accommodate all of you in my house then I thought better to come here all of you would fit here!

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,449
And today is the last day for our Sahaj Yogis (before India Tour).

3
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:26,675
We have to understand certain very, very important
things about ourselves and our organisation that is Divine.

4
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:42,390
Now, in broad lines, I can tell you, not individual
problems and individual things because you are no more individuals now.

5
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:50,013
You have become part and parcel of the divine Being and you are awakened cells.

6
00:00:50,013 --> 00:00:59,310
And so, in a broad way we must understand what we have to do about it.

7
00:01:02,553 --> 00:01:12,512
First thing, we have to kno that we are Realised souls,

8
00:01:12,512 --> 00:01:27,705
and that you have got Realisation and that you are saints; that you have all the powers that a saint could have.

9
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:35,510
No saint ever had more powers than you have, as it is, which is manifesting.

10
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:41,159
No saint had any knowledge that you have today.

11
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:49,949
You’ll be amazed, none of the books which have been written so far have been able to

12
00:01:49,949 --> 00:01:58,500
tell you about the spiritual being that is
within you as you have come to know through

13
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,860
Sahaja Yoga.

14
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,250
One has to accept it.

15
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,279
It is so.

16
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:14,570
Any one of them, whosoever has written any
books – even, I would say, Adi Shankaracharya,

17
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,410
he could not explain so many things which
you know.

18
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:28,440
But the quality of Adi Shankaracharya is very
great, or people of his type – Markandeya

19
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,670
or Buddha.

20
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:37,010
The quality is very high because they are
extremely pure people – purity.

21
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:43,950
They have achieved individual salvation of
a very high degree.

22
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:49,720
While you have achieved your collective salvation
better.

23
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,860
But individually they are of a very, very
high quality.

24
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:59,950
I mean, they had no doubts about Divine Power,
they had no doubts about God.

25
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:05,390
They never had any doubts and they were very
dignified.

26
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,500
And they never bothered as to their petty
problems of life.

27
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,970
For them this was too petty to think about.

28
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:19,000
Anything which is so petty, we spent so much
time over it.

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:28,940
I know we had to do it because, after all,
we are human beings and are coming into Sahaja

30
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:39,500
Yoga with our human awareness and then we
got our Realisation.

31
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,000
So the purification time is very, very short.

32
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,850
And while they had such a lot of time to purify
themselves.

33
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:55,360
Now, for example, Moses was an incarnation,
a very pure form of a personality or, you

34
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,800
can say, Jesus was an incarnation, absolutely
purest form of incarnation.

35
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:12,570
But they are there to be our ideals while
what we have done is to become, from human

36
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,980
beings, a prophet.

37
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:22,589
So you understand both the things very well,
what the weaknesses human beings have, what

38
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:31,360
are their problems, how they get away from
reality, how they are deluded.

39
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,360
But still we do not use our vibratory power
as we should use.

40
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:43,640
And this is the point I want to tell you – that
you all have vibratory powers.

41
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:52,760
When we start using our vibratory powers also
we do not know what dignity, protocol we should

42
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,390
have for using this power.

43
00:04:54,390 --> 00:05:06,089
It is the power of the Deities within us and it’s a ritual by which we get their power

44
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:08,079
working in us.

45
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:18,263
As you know that people of ancient times did lot of miracles through this power but they

46
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,853
were very dignified people.

47
00:05:21,993 --> 00:05:31,836
There was no frivolousness in their character
and not useless problems within them, absolutely

48
00:05:31,843 --> 00:05:33,566
of no spiritual value.

49
00:05:33,606 --> 00:05:39,347
When you use your vibratory awareness you
should not use them for useless powers like,

50
00:05:39,347 --> 00:05:44,916
for example, going to a cinema and there’s
a traffic and you think that there’s a traffic

51
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,979
so you must use your vibratory powers to reach
that place.

52
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:50,809
Because it’s frivolous; it does not matter.

53
00:05:50,856 --> 00:05:56,546
In Sahaja Yoga it does not matter whether you go to a cinema or not.

54
00:05:56,546 --> 00:06:01,356
What matters is: what are your spiritual powers, how far you have come in your spirituality.

55
00:06:01,356 --> 00:06:04,826
It (the cinema) does not matter at all.

56
00:06:04,826 --> 00:06:11,395
You are a saint, and what saintliness you are achieving within you is the main problem.

57
00:06:11,395 --> 00:06:17,246
Otherwise, all the rest of the things that
you have, has no meaning.

58
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:21,025
Or all these problems have no meaning in spirituality.

59
00:06:21,025 --> 00:06:29,675
So, all the Sahaja Yogis must realise that you are now newly born and you are people

60
00:06:29,675 --> 00:06:33,136
of new awareness and you have to have that
dignity.

61
00:06:33,136 --> 00:06:37,176
I’ll just give an example because I was
discussing with someone today,

62
00:06:37,176 --> 00:06:43,259
that when you give somebody a sort of a bandhan, you just turn your hand like this or like that.

63
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:44,720
This is not the way it should be done.

64
00:06:45,076 --> 00:06:48,925
Your hands itself are to be respected because these are the hands of a saint.

65
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:54,715
And all the deities reside on your hands and
fingers so when you have to give them bandhan

66
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:57,285
or anything, you have to use them properly.

67
00:06:57,285 --> 00:07:03,845
Use them in such a way that it’s dignified
to do it.

68
00:07:03,845 --> 00:07:11,416
Any indignity or cheap behaviour should be
absolutely avoided.

69
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:19,745
Then dealing with each other you have to know
that you are all now in the circulation of

70
00:07:19,745 --> 00:07:20,745
Divine Power.

71
00:07:20,745 --> 00:07:24,035
You have to respect each other and really
love each other.

72
00:07:24,046 --> 00:07:27,295
You must respect because you are all saints.

73
00:07:27,355 --> 00:07:30,065
Every saint must respect another saint.

74
00:07:30,128 --> 00:07:31,937
That’s the minimum of minimum.

75
00:07:31,937 --> 00:07:38,668
And if you do not respect each other, your
chakras will go out of order, especially Vishuddhi

76
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:40,358
because it’s the collective thing.

77
00:07:40,358 --> 00:07:46,587
And also Mother’s Chakra will go out because
your sense of security is your collectivity.

78
00:07:46,587 --> 00:07:58,777
And the love between each other has to be
not only looked after but is to be nourished

79
00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:03,508
and to be worshipped and it should be a virtue.

80
00:08:03,508 --> 00:08:08,937
You should not treat each other as human beings
treat each other.

81
00:08:08,937 --> 00:08:09,937
No!

82
00:08:09,937 --> 00:08:11,848
It’s a precious thing.

83
00:08:11,848 --> 00:08:17,887
And even while talking to anyone very close
– say your brother, sister, husband, wife

84
00:08:17,887 --> 00:08:22,628
– you must respect, you must respect, otherwise,
it has no meaning.

85
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:27,767
You must respect your parents much more than
you ever respected because they are Sahaja

86
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:31,488
Yogis, because they are saints and they are
your parents.

87
00:08:31,488 --> 00:08:36,978
Respect is the keynote of relationship with
each other to begin with.

88
00:08:36,978 --> 00:08:39,758
And respect without love has no meaning.

89
00:08:39,758 --> 00:08:43,178
Respect and love for each other.

90
00:08:43,178 --> 00:08:49,178
Whether somebody is highly placed in life,
somebody is lowly placed in life, in Sahaja

91
00:08:49,178 --> 00:08:51,148
Yoga it does not matter.

92
00:08:51,148 --> 00:08:58,368
How much you earn, what is your position in
life, where you live is not important.

93
00:08:58,368 --> 00:09:02,688
The main important thing is that we are one
and we are the people who have become now

94
00:09:02,688 --> 00:09:09,118
prophets and we are the ones who have got
the powers to raise the Kundalini of others

95
00:09:09,118 --> 00:09:15,078
and such a power has come into us because
our Mother loves us very much and it is our

96
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:17,238
duty that we should love each other.

97
00:09:17,238 --> 00:09:23,048
And how I respect you?

98
00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:27,748
I need not because you know that there’s
a big gap between you and me.

99
00:09:27,748 --> 00:09:31,028
But I respect you because you are saints.

100
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:37,448
And where the saints are not respected that country goes to dogs.

101
00:09:37,448 --> 00:09:41,938
So first of all you must learn how to respect
each other.

102
00:09:41,938 --> 00:09:46,448
And that is a very, very important training
we should have.

103
00:09:46,448 --> 00:09:54,488
Whether he’s your husband or wife, whether
he’s your brother or sister, father, mother

104
00:09:54,488 --> 00:09:58,518
or child, because he’s a saint – respect!

105
00:09:58,518 --> 00:10:03,808
But I do not know how you will react to this
one that immediately you start thinking about

106
00:10:03,808 --> 00:10:06,108
people who do not respect you.

107
00:10:06,108 --> 00:10:09,978
Think how many people you do not respect.

108
00:10:09,978 --> 00:10:16,108
It’s a typical ego-oriented reaction that
immediately we start thinking, “Oh, that

109
00:10:16,108 --> 00:10:17,438
man does not respect me!

110
00:10:17,438 --> 00:10:18,438
That man does not respect!”

111
00:10:18,438 --> 00:10:23,158
But just think how many people you have not respected yourself.

112
00:10:23,158 --> 00:10:33,758
When I am not here, I am here much more.

113
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:39,768
I have not been to Australia, and you know how tremendously these people have come up

114
00:10:39,768 --> 00:10:43,268
– so pure and so good and so fantastic.

115
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:47,938
But that has not happened so much here because
I had to work, really labour here.

116
00:10:48,358 --> 00:10:50,868
Not that England is that bad.

117
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:55,421
But all the time to feel that, “Mother is
around.

118
00:10:55,439 --> 00:10:58,558
We’ll put all our problems to Her and She
can solve them.

119
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:03,589
” Even small, small problems you bring to
me – it’s all right – but now you are

120
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:08,453
capable of solving your problems as well as
solving the problems of others.

121
00:11:08,496 --> 00:11:13,596
Unless it is something fundamental you need
not bother about me and you need not also

122
00:11:13,596 --> 00:11:14,596
ask me about it.

123
00:11:14,596 --> 00:11:15,966
You can go ahead with it.

124
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:24,626
But you must think everything in the terms
of Sahaja Yoga by which – how much, by that,

125
00:11:24,626 --> 00:11:26,946
you are doing for Sahaja Yoga?

126
00:11:26,946 --> 00:11:28,756
How much you are working out for Sahaja Yoga?

127
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:31,556
This was the meeting of the Sahaja Yogis today.

128
00:11:31,556 --> 00:11:38,206
And fundamentally we have to understand one
thing: that we have to grow and we have to

129
00:11:38,206 --> 00:11:42,636
let others grow with our growth.

130
00:11:42,636 --> 00:11:45,616
Not by curbing our growth, but with our growth.

131
00:11:45,616 --> 00:11:48,496
You’ll only grow if you make others grow
with you.

132
00:11:48,496 --> 00:11:51,326
Otherwise, there will be no growth.

133
00:11:51,326 --> 00:11:59,616
Now, whatever I say goes into the books, sometimes
into the brains of the people.

134
00:11:59,616 --> 00:12:04,216
It has to go into the heart.

135
00:12:04,216 --> 00:12:09,186
The whole Sahaja Yoga system works on the
heart; that is the Spirit.

136
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:12,676
Spirit is the thing I’m talking about.

137
00:12:12,676 --> 00:12:17,446
It’s the Spirit [that] is happy by that.

138
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:23,496
Some people, I am told, are using their hands
like a weapon and all that.

139
00:12:23,496 --> 00:12:25,466
This is very dangerous!

140
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:30,406
You are not supposed to do all this for yourself.

141
00:12:30,406 --> 00:12:32,996
You are still saints, you are not yet gods!

142
00:12:32,996 --> 00:12:35,616
So don’t try such things.

143
00:12:35,616 --> 00:12:40,406
Some people have a habit of also hitting a
person with the hand like that.

144
00:12:40,406 --> 00:12:41,756
In my presence, if I say, it’s all right.

145
00:12:41,756 --> 00:12:46,136
But otherwise you should not.

146
00:12:46,136 --> 00:12:47,366
You have to respect.

147
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:57,076
Use all tender and gentle methods, never anything
by which you show any disrespect to a saint.

148
00:12:57,076 --> 00:13:03,466
Of course, you are hitting the negativity
in another person, I know that.

149
00:13:03,466 --> 00:13:09,676
But you have no business to do that or to
discard anyone or to put somebody out of this

150
00:13:09,676 --> 00:13:10,676
thing.

151
00:13:10,676 --> 00:13:13,406
You will go down very much.

152
00:13:13,406 --> 00:13:19,806
This is a serious thing one must understand.

153
00:13:19,806 --> 00:13:22,226
You have all the powers you know how far to
go.

154
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:23,996
You must keep to your maryadas.

155
00:13:23,996 --> 00:13:29,606
Don’t go beyond, because these things give
you ego, and ego is the most dangerous thing

156
00:13:29,606 --> 00:13:32,076
which we face always.

157
00:13:32,076 --> 00:13:35,256
Try to improve your language.

158
00:13:35,256 --> 00:13:36,816
Be gentle.

159
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:41,526
Be very gentle with each other.

160
00:13:41,526 --> 00:13:46,336
I expect that you’ll have many more people
by the time I come.

161
00:13:46,336 --> 00:13:48,926
I expect fantastic things from you.

162
00:13:48,926 --> 00:13:53,856
I don’t know if I should but I have given
you something so fantastic, so tremendous.

163
00:13:53,856 --> 00:13:57,376
It is unbelievable.

164
00:13:57,376 --> 00:14:05,546
I expect it from you, no doubt, because you
are specially selected and I have worked with

165
00:14:05,546 --> 00:14:07,096
you for years together.

166
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:10,406
You have got the tapes in English.

167
00:14:10,406 --> 00:14:15,486
French people, poor things, they don’t have
tapes in French and they have to be translated.

168
00:14:15,486 --> 00:14:20,816
They haven’t got a book in French and they
have big problems of understanding me.

169
00:14:20,816 --> 00:14:27,046
But how dedicated they were, how deep they
are.

170
00:14:27,046 --> 00:14:32,966
Each one of them came and said, “Mother,
I love You very much.

171
00:14:32,966 --> 00:14:33,966
I love You.

172
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:37,536
 “I have many defects and I offer myself
to You.”

173
00:14:37,546 --> 00:14:40,586
Will you accept me?”

174
00:14:40,586 --> 00:14:43,286
All of them said this way.

175
00:14:43,286 --> 00:14:44,286
Just imagine!

176
00:14:44,286 --> 00:14:50,016
I mean, I was surprised how they were saying
all these things to me and the way they were

177
00:14:50,016 --> 00:14:52,386
understanding their defects within themselves.

178
00:14:52,386 --> 00:15:01,976
Now, we have to change our mode of behaviour
towards financial, material, emotional, physical

179
00:15:01,976 --> 00:15:05,666
and all these things.

180
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:13,116
For example, say, one is married – marriages
should be successful.

181
00:15:13,116 --> 00:15:19,136
If your marriage is not successful and happy,
you are not going to be blessed, not at all.

182
00:15:19,136 --> 00:15:21,866
Try to make your marriage very happy and successful.

183
00:15:21,866 --> 00:15:23,996
That’s very important.

184
00:15:23,996 --> 00:15:27,836
Marriage is the institution established by
Adi Shakti.

185
00:15:27,836 --> 00:15:30,236
You cannot dishonour it.

186
00:15:30,236 --> 00:15:33,306
Do not play frivolously with your marriages.

187
00:15:33,306 --> 00:15:42,256
Then you must also allow the children to be
born to you so that you get great souls coming

188
00:15:42,256 --> 00:15:51,406
down on this earth by which we are giving
them a chance, a very good chance, to lead

189
00:15:51,406 --> 00:15:52,616
a very happy life.

190
00:15:52,616 --> 00:15:57,386
But if husbands, wives are not happy, and
even if Realised-souls are born, they have

191
00:15:57,386 --> 00:16:02,436
a trouble with you and they do not prosper
well and they have problems.

192
00:16:02,436 --> 00:16:08,416
So, first of all, create a family of happiness
and joy.

193
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:13,476
Some people think if they get away from Sahaja
Yogis, they’ll make a good, happy married

194
00:16:13,476 --> 00:16:14,476
life.

195
00:16:14,476 --> 00:16:16,296
It’s absolutely wrong!

196
00:16:16,296 --> 00:16:18,756
Absolutely wrong!

197
00:16:18,756 --> 00:16:24,215
If you cannot make a happy married life in
the ashram, you cannot make it anywhere else.

198
00:16:24,215 --> 00:16:26,266
First try in the ashram.

199
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:27,556
[It’s] worth trying.

200
00:16:27,556 --> 00:16:29,626
Otherwise, you cannot make it.

201
00:16:29,626 --> 00:16:33,726
Because then you understand how you share
your life with others and your married life.

202
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:38,676
Any such thing like any material thing, like
getting a house or getting this thing, that

203
00:16:38,676 --> 00:16:40,616
thing is not so important.

204
00:16:40,616 --> 00:16:45,446
Your house should be clean within yourself,
your temple of your heart.

205
00:16:45,446 --> 00:16:49,396
We are not here to build houses, not to accumulate
money.

206
00:16:49,396 --> 00:16:52,496
We are here to build our temples within ourselves.

207
00:16:52,496 --> 00:16:59,331
The real temples which are growing, which are the living temples of living God within us.

208
00:16:59,396 --> 00:17:05,126
So these material things are important up to a point, not more than that.

209
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:12,268
Most important is not how you are substantiated by Sahaja Yoga but how much you have substantiated Sahaja Yoga through.

210
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:16,466
Many people think, “We should get a good house because we have come to Mataji.

211
00:17:16,466 --> 00:17:18,902
Yes, you do get. You get good jobs. All right.

212
00:17:18,902 --> 00:17:21,342
You get it. You get your financial conditions improved.

213
00:17:21,342 --> 00:17:22,911
All right. Everything happens to you.

214
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:26,763
But how much have you given to Sahaja Yoga?

215
00:17:26,936 --> 00:17:29,536
In the way: how much have you substantiated?

216
00:17:29,536 --> 00:17:33,235
People think sometimes that if they donate money that’s sufficient. It’s not.

217
00:17:33,616 --> 00:17:43,590
To enrich it with your heart, with your lovingness, with your friendship, with your sweet understanding of each other,

218
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:48,386
enjoyment of each other’s company in the purest form, not with any purpose

219
00:17:48,386 --> 00:17:58,056
or with any intention of getting any low type of joy or low type of happiness from someone

220
00:17:58,056 --> 00:17:59,506
ego-oriented or sex-oriented.

221
00:17:59,506 --> 00:18:04,056
But it’s pure joy, pure joy.

222
00:18:04,056 --> 00:18:06,626
Purity is the theme we have to take to.

223
00:18:06,626 --> 00:18:10,696
We have to try to be purer and purer.

224
00:18:10,696 --> 00:18:20,134
And the purity will be shown brilliantly on your faces, in your behaviour, in the whole being as you would be.

225
00:18:20,134 --> 00:18:24,904
Your presence itself will show that you are Sahaja Yogis.

226
00:18:25,186 --> 00:18:26,386
You won’t have to certify.

227
00:18:26,386 --> 00:18:31,926
You won’t have to wear some special dresses to say, but people will know from your faces

228
00:18:31,926 --> 00:18:34,866
that you are saints, from your behaviour.

229
00:18:34,866 --> 00:18:39,116
You have to stand back in the last queue.

230
00:18:39,116 --> 00:18:41,366
You should be the people who should look at things.

231
00:18:41,366 --> 00:18:48,036
You should not be the first, unique, to get into the thing first, to getting into the queue first.

232
00:18:48,036 --> 00:18:52,229
No, you are the last because you are with yourself. They are not.

233
00:18:52,726 --> 00:18:54,616
They have not [got] their own securities.

234
00:18:54,616 --> 00:18:57,296
They are trying to find securities in these things.

235
00:18:57,296 --> 00:19:00,136
You have your own securities.

236
00:19:00,136 --> 00:19:09,506
Change, according to the Spirit, all your priorities, and then joy is your own.

237
00:19:09,506 --> 00:19:16,206
I really expect fantastic things from you and I hope you all will join together and

238
00:19:16,206 --> 00:19:21,346
work it out and create something fantastic.

239
00:19:21,346 --> 00:19:26,476
I don’t know how to tell individually about things but as it is I have already spoken

240
00:19:26,476 --> 00:19:31,995
to these Sahaja Yogis in Paris and I have told them that Sahaja Yoga is a very speedy

241
00:19:31,995 --> 00:19:32,995
thing.

242
00:19:32,995 --> 00:19:33,995
And it’s very speedy.

243
00:19:33,995 --> 00:19:39,589
It’s such a speed and if you do not keep with the speed of Sahaja Yoga you’ll be

244
00:19:39,696 --> 00:19:40,696
thrown out.

245
00:19:40,739 --> 00:19:43,539
You have to keep to the speed of Sahaja Yoga.

246
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:48,009
Those who cannot keep by some method or other,
or [who] get locked up by something or some

247
00:19:48,009 --> 00:19:50,359
misidentification, will drop out.

248
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:55,459
You’ll only grow when you will keep to the speed of Sahaja Yoga.

249
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:57,779
It is going to be tremendous in India.

250
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:01,159
I know these five years are going to be tremendous
in Australia.

251
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:05,609
England may be, depending on your people putting
up the speed.

252
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:10,369
It’s going to be tremendously speedy and
you have to understand that – drop out all

253
00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:18,419
your shackles and drop out all your misidentifications,
all nonsenses of fanaticism or of misidentifications

254
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:21,299
that you are British, this, that, all this.

255
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:23,659
And just become Sahaja Yogis and universal
beings.

256
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:24,659
It’s very important.

257
00:20:24,659 --> 00:20:26,599
The time has come now.

258
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:28,439
From next year it will start.

259
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:30,830
So, I wish you a very Happy New Year

260
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:35,660
and a very, very happy and cheerful Christmas. May God bless you.

1
00:51:26,727 --> 00:51:29,477
Who are the new people today, for the first
time?

2
00:51:29,477 --> 00:51:30,477
You?

3
00:51:30,477 --> 00:51:36,667
I am sorry I had to say all these things because
today was the meeting of the Sahaja Yogis

4
00:51:36,667 --> 00:51:38,116
in the beginning.

5
00:51:38,116 --> 00:51:44,526
And we are all going to enter into the same
Realm and it will be handy for you to know

6
00:51:44,526 --> 00:51:54,317
what is expected of Sahaja Yogis, and with
that expectation I request you not to pay

7
00:51:54,317 --> 00:51:59,797
attention to what I have said, much.

8
00:51:59,797 --> 00:52:00,907
You should not be frightened.

9
00:52:00,907 --> 00:52:02,067
It’s not that frightening.

10
00:52:02,067 --> 00:52:03,987
You’ll like it later on very much!

11
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:06,597
What I have said it, you see.

12
00:52:06,597 --> 00:52:07,787
So come forward.

13
00:52:07,787 --> 00:52:12,917
Those who have come for the first time, please
come forward.

14
00:52:12,917 --> 00:52:14,217
You come for the first time?

15
00:52:14,217 --> 00:52:15,217
All right.

16
00:52:15,217 --> 00:52:16,217
Come forward!

17
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:18,097
Will be better idea.

18
00:52:18,097 --> 00:52:21,176
No, no, here, on the chair.

19
00:52:21,176 --> 00:52:23,647
On the first row of chairs.

20
00:52:23,647 --> 00:52:26,247
Will be a good idea.

21
00:52:26,247 --> 00:52:27,247
Yes.

22
00:52:27,247 --> 00:52:29,407
Actually, it happens that your religion gets
enlightened.

23
00:52:29,407 --> 00:52:30,407
You become that.

24
00:52:30,407 --> 00:52:32,497
Then you can’t help it.

25
00:52:32,497 --> 00:52:33,497
What to do?

26
00:52:33,497 --> 00:52:36,017
I mean you don’t have to tell, “Don’t
do!

27
00:52:36,017 --> 00:52:37,286
Don’t do!”

28
00:52:37,286 --> 00:52:39,176
It just happens.

29
00:52:39,176 --> 00:52:42,337
You just can’t do it.

30
00:52:42,337 --> 00:52:45,506
It’s so helpful, isn’t it?

31
00:52:45,506 --> 00:52:48,666
You just can’t do it.

32
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:52,456
You don’t feel like doing it!

33
00:52:52,456 --> 00:52:55,297
Because if you are enjoying your Spirit you
don’t feel like doing nonsensical things.

34
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:58,727
It is better to get it and see for yourself
what happens.

35
00:52:58,727 --> 00:52:59,727
All right?

36
00:52:59,727 --> 00:53:02,326
That’s the best way to give it a full chance.

37
00:53:02,326 --> 00:53:05,736
Those who have come for the first time do
come forward.

38
00:53:05,736 --> 00:53:07,346
You’ve come for the first time?

39
00:53:07,346 --> 00:53:08,346
Please come forward.

40
00:53:08,346 --> 00:53:09,346
No!

41
00:53:09,346 --> 00:53:10,346
You are not for the first time!

42
00:53:10,346 --> 00:53:11,346
Let her come forward here.

43
00:53:11,346 --> 00:53:13,477
You are all for the first time here?

44
00:53:13,477 --> 00:53:14,477
No.

45
00:53:14,477 --> 00:53:18,127
You can go one step backward, is a good idea.

46
00:53:18,127 --> 00:53:22,547
You see, you can receive my vibrations even
from there where Kingsley is.

47
00:53:22,547 --> 00:53:24,587
Isn’t it Kingsley?

48
00:53:24,587 --> 00:53:27,977
Aren’t you receiving my vibrations?

49
00:53:27,977 --> 00:53:28,977
Much more!

50
00:53:28,977 --> 00:53:30,486
Yes that’s it.

51
00:53:30,486 --> 00:53:36,757
Now this is a system which is built within
us.

52
00:53:36,757 --> 00:53:41,977
That’s why it is called as ‘Sahaja’.

53
00:53:41,977 --> 00:53:47,007
This is what is the system within us that
exists.

54
00:53:47,007 --> 00:53:49,187
‘Sahaja’ means ‘born with you’.

55
00:53:49,187 --> 00:53:51,797
This is all born with you.

56
00:53:51,797 --> 00:53:53,107
You have achieved it.

57
00:53:53,107 --> 00:53:54,717
It’s all within you.

58
00:53:54,717 --> 00:53:57,227
It’s a system that is built into this or
built into that.

59
00:53:57,227 --> 00:54:00,797
In the same way it’s a system built into
you.

60
00:54:00,797 --> 00:54:03,407
You are just ready.

61
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:04,587
You are to be put to the mains.

62
00:54:04,587 --> 00:54:06,377
That’s all is the job is.

63
00:54:06,377 --> 00:54:09,177
For putting to the mains also there’s something
built into you.

64
00:54:09,177 --> 00:54:15,077
If you see the triangular bone called as ‘sacrum’,
means ‘sacred bone’, this Kundalini is

65
00:54:15,077 --> 00:54:16,077
there.

66
00:54:16,077 --> 00:54:21,227
This is the one that gives you your rebirth.

67
00:54:21,227 --> 00:54:27,337
By rebirth what happens [is] that your awareness,
which is human awareness, becomes enlightened

68
00:54:27,337 --> 00:54:29,467
by your Spirit.

69
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:30,957
Your Spirit comes into your awareness.

70
00:54:30,957 --> 00:54:32,137
So far your Spirit is not.

71
00:54:32,137 --> 00:54:36,347
Your Spirit knows all about you.

72
00:54:36,347 --> 00:54:39,247
It is in your heart.

73
00:54:39,247 --> 00:54:44,549
But you do not know about It.

74
00:54:44,549 --> 00:54:49,707
So what happens [is] this Spirit, which is
enjoying itself, enlightens your awareness

75
00:54:49,707 --> 00:54:55,587
and you get a new awareness by which you start
feeling a cool breeze in your hand, a cool

76
00:54:55,587 --> 00:54:57,257
breeze in your hand.

77
00:54:57,257 --> 00:55:02,377
And this cool breeze, for the first time,
on your central nervous system starts flowing.

78
00:55:02,377 --> 00:55:06,247
So you feel it, actually you feel it.

79
00:55:06,247 --> 00:55:10,507
Now the enlightenment takes place of all these
centres which are within you, which are there

80
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:11,887
because of our evolutionary process.

81
00:55:11,887 --> 00:55:20,697
And these enlightened centres are on your
fingers.

82
00:55:20,697 --> 00:55:25,137
They get enlightened too and you start feeling
them within you.

83
00:55:25,137 --> 00:55:30,107
You start feeling your own centres and you
start feeling the centres of others.

84
00:55:30,107 --> 00:55:35,687
Now this happening takes place within you
of the Kundalini awakening just to attract

85
00:55:35,687 --> 00:55:36,757
your attention inside.

86
00:55:36,757 --> 00:55:38,687
Because your attention is outside, you cannot
take it in.

87
00:55:38,687 --> 00:55:42,636
You know many people think, “You put your
attention here, you put your attention there.

88
00:55:42,636 --> 00:55:43,657
” – it’s all wrong.

89
00:55:43,657 --> 00:55:48,467
It has to be spontaneously attracted inside
and it’s done by this Kundalini, and Kundalini

90
00:55:48,467 --> 00:55:53,607
is just like a germinating primule within
us, a seed.

91
00:55:53,607 --> 00:55:57,967
It just rises spontaneously.

92
00:55:57,967 --> 00:56:00,567
And when it rises it breaks through here.

93
00:56:00,567 --> 00:56:02,157
And this is what is the real Baptism.

94
00:56:02,157 --> 00:56:06,637
You really feel it here coming out.

95
00:56:06,637 --> 00:56:09,137
You can feel the cool breeze coming out.

96
00:56:09,137 --> 00:56:13,657
You can feel the cool breeze from your hands.

97
00:56:13,657 --> 00:56:21,657
This is real Baptism that John the Baptist
wanted people to have, and that Christ talked

98
00:56:21,657 --> 00:56:22,657
about.

99
00:56:22,657 --> 00:56:27,397
All the religions have taught us to be in
the centre.

100
00:56:27,397 --> 00:56:33,107
When they said, “Don’t do this, don’t
do that,” they did not want to condition

101
00:56:33,107 --> 00:56:41,777
us but to tell us that how we are going to
be in the centre.

102
00:56:41,777 --> 00:56:56,247
And when we are in the centre then what happens
to us [is] that you get the desire to know

103
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:57,997
your Spirit.

104
00:56:57,997 --> 00:57:04,187
And this desire is fulfilled through the awakening
of the Kundalini.

105
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:10,307
Now the Sahaja Yoga at this stage is really
a Maha Yoga in the sense [that] it is the

106
00:57:10,307 --> 00:57:13,947
Great Yoga because many people can get Realisation.

107
00:57:13,947 --> 00:57:19,947
Thousands of people can get it because the
blossom time has come.

108
00:57:19,947 --> 00:57:26,167
But even if they get Realisation, they are
to be looked after, they are to be nourished,

109
00:57:26,167 --> 00:57:28,397
they are to be told about it.

110
00:57:28,397 --> 00:57:29,997
Everything should be decoded.

111
00:57:29,997 --> 00:57:32,697
You will be amazed – everything becomes
so logical.

112
00:57:32,697 --> 00:57:35,647
Gradually you start understanding it.

113
00:57:35,647 --> 00:57:39,347
Your complete freedom is established.

114
00:57:39,347 --> 00:57:41,397
Nobody says that, “Don’t do this!”

115
00:57:41,397 --> 00:57:42,527
Nothing is said.

116
00:57:42,527 --> 00:57:47,937
But you just don’t do it – yourself!

117
00:57:47,937 --> 00:57:50,577
I will not tell you as Moses had to tell,
poor thing.

118
00:57:50,637 --> 00:57:52,987
He had to face all the mad people.

119
00:57:53,017 --> 00:57:59,047
But no, after Realisation it just happens
and you just don’t do it.

120
00:57:59,047 --> 00:58:00,047
You will not do it.

121
00:58:00,047 --> 00:58:01,047
It just happens to you.

122
00:58:01,047 --> 00:58:03,597
It is nothing to be told.

123
00:58:03,597 --> 00:58:04,787
It just happens.

124
00:58:04,787 --> 00:58:06,277
It works out.

125
00:58:06,277 --> 00:58:10,607
This is what is Sahaja Yoga.

126
00:58:10,607 --> 00:58:13,817
In the beginning you have to be really ardent
Sahaja Yogis.

127
00:58:13,817 --> 00:58:14,817
In the beginning you have to be.

128
00:58:14,817 --> 00:58:17,947
It’s the beginning of Sahaja Yoga still
in England, I would say.

129
00:58:17,947 --> 00:58:22,727
Really ardently attached to it by which you
develop yourself very well and develop this

130
00:58:22,727 --> 00:58:25,717
tree of Sahaja Yoga in your own country.

131
00:58:25,717 --> 00:58:27,977
Because you have to save so many.

132
00:58:27,977 --> 00:58:29,836
The Last Judgment has started.

133
00:58:29,836 --> 00:58:30,836
It’s started.

134
00:58:30,836 --> 00:58:33,737
Through Kundalini awakening only you judge
yourself.

135
00:58:33,737 --> 00:58:36,637
You know what are the centres you are catching,
what are your problems.

136
00:58:36,637 --> 00:58:38,697
You know what are the centres others are catching.

137
00:58:38,697 --> 00:58:39,697
You judge yourself.

138
00:58:39,697 --> 00:58:43,737
Supposing a person comes and tell me, “Mother,
my Agnya is very bad.

139
00:58:43,737 --> 00:58:44,907
” Do you know what it means?

140
00:58:44,907 --> 00:58:46,576
That, “My ego has developed.

141
00:58:46,576 --> 00:58:49,937
” But [if] you tell somebody, “You have
got an ego.

142
00:58:49,937 --> 00:58:52,077
” – you will have a punch on your head!

143
00:58:52,077 --> 00:58:57,357
But the person himself comes and says, “Mother,
I see my ego.

144
00:58:57,357 --> 00:58:58,777
” You start seeing yourself.

145
00:58:58,777 --> 00:59:03,086
You start seeing your problems, because you
are out of it.

146
00:59:03,086 --> 00:59:06,336
And then you can cure it also and make it
better.

147
00:59:06,336 --> 00:59:11,257
You improve it and you are better.

148
00:59:11,257 --> 00:59:14,767
You judge yourself and you judge yourself
with love and understanding.

149
00:59:14,767 --> 00:59:16,537
You don’t hate yourself by that.

150
00:59:16,537 --> 00:59:17,537
It’s only you, yourself.

151
00:59:17,537 --> 00:59:18,537
You are going to judge.

152
00:59:18,537 --> 00:59:25,627
Within you is the power of God that judges
you, is the Spirit which tells you.

153
00:59:25,627 --> 00:59:27,979
A rapport is established with the Spirit.

154
00:59:27,979 --> 00:59:32,247
The Spirit itself will tell you, “This is
the mistake, this is the problem.

155
00:59:32,247 --> 00:59:33,597
” We don’t need anybody to tell us.

156
00:59:33,597 --> 00:59:36,227
It’s only you who will know.

157
00:59:36,227 --> 00:59:39,297
It’s only you who will judge yourself.

158
00:59:39,297 --> 00:59:41,017
It’s only you who will grow yourself.

159
00:59:41,017 --> 00:59:42,707
It’s your own freedom.

160
00:59:42,707 --> 00:59:45,157
It’s your own Self.

161
00:59:45,157 --> 00:59:49,457
Your entire personality changes, entire personality
changes.

162
00:59:49,457 --> 00:59:54,777
I have never told anybody not to take drugs
as such, except for one or two people who

163
00:59:54,777 --> 00:59:56,067
were still carrying on.

164
00:59:56,067 --> 00:59:57,366
But also very mildly.

165
00:59:57,366 --> 01:00:00,607
And I told them how to get rid of it.

166
01:00:00,607 --> 01:00:03,797
But you just don’t want to take them, just
don’t like it.

167
01:00:03,797 --> 01:00:08,607
You find it very filthy.

168
01:00:08,607 --> 01:00:10,797
You feel like vomiting.

169
01:00:10,797 --> 01:00:12,813
Just like that, the religion is enlightened
in your stomach.

170
01:00:12,813 --> 01:00:15,047
That the time has come now for you to do it.

171
01:00:15,047 --> 01:00:18,597
That was the time when it was not so [then]
they taught you how to do it.

172
01:00:18,597 --> 01:00:19,977
But today the time has come, it can work out.

173
01:00:19,977 --> 01:00:22,876
You are all just there.

174
01:00:22,876 --> 01:00:27,337
The completion of the whole creation has to
come this way.

175
01:00:27,337 --> 01:00:29,867
It has to work out.

176
01:00:29,867 --> 01:00:32,457
But you cannot reason it out.

177
01:00:32,457 --> 01:00:36,337
But once you get it – because it’s beyond
reason, it happens beyond reason; the Kundalini

178
01:00:36,337 --> 01:00:41,777
awakens not by reason, spontaneously, by master
only – once it happens then the whole thing

179
01:00:41,777 --> 01:00:43,877
becomes logical.

180
01:00:43,877 --> 01:00:46,327
You see, there’s a microscope, then you
can see through it.

181
01:00:46,327 --> 01:00:48,977
But if there is not a microscope, you cannot
understand.

182
01:00:48,977 --> 01:00:53,847
The ‘microscope’ is your Spirit.

183
01:00:53,847 --> 01:00:56,777
It’s very simple.

184
01:00:56,777 --> 01:01:00,767
Now, I do not want to go into details about
it.

185
01:01:00,767 --> 01:01:02,467
I think these people have been given…

186
01:01:02,467 --> 01:01:07,037
Gavin have you given them the papers and things?

187
01:01:07,037 --> 01:01:12,537
Let them see for themselves.

188
01:01:12,537 --> 01:01:17,547
Have you all got the papers?

189
01:01:17,547 --> 01:01:19,107
Have you got?

190
01:01:19,107 --> 01:01:20,107
No?

191
01:01:20,107 --> 01:01:21,187
Let her have.

192
01:01:21,187 --> 01:01:23,267
Let this lady have.

193
01:01:23,267 --> 01:01:26,327
You sit a little erect, all right?

194
01:01:26,327 --> 01:01:28,337
Straight, sit little straight.

195
01:01:28,337 --> 01:01:29,347
All right.

196
01:01:29,347 --> 01:01:33,267
You have to sit a little erect, not much,
but a little erect.

197
01:01:33,267 --> 01:01:34,527
Not slouchy.

198
01:01:34,527 --> 01:01:36,457
Neither like this.

199
01:01:36,457 --> 01:01:37,907
Just sit straight.

200
01:01:37,907 --> 01:01:41,637
Put your hands like this, all of you.

201
01:01:41,637 --> 01:01:44,497
Just put your hands.

202
01:01:44,497 --> 01:01:47,347
Now close your eyes.

203
01:01:47,347 --> 01:01:54,497
Put your feet like this, little straight,
on the ground.

204
01:01:54,497 --> 01:02:06,367
Not pressing much but they should be on the
ground properly.

205
01:02:06,367 --> 01:02:07,797
Come in!

206
01:02:07,797 --> 01:02:09,037
Come!

207
01:02:09,037 --> 01:02:15,267
There are three, four seats.

208
01:02:15,267 --> 01:02:18,997
Here, in front.

209
01:02:18,997 --> 01:02:20,247
Yes.

210
01:02:20,247 --> 01:02:33,196
After Realisation you have to go very fast
and try to understand it, otherwise you may

211
01:02:33,196 --> 01:02:34,477
lose your vibrations.

212
01:02:34,477 --> 01:02:35,477
That happens with some people.

213
01:02:35,477 --> 01:02:36,477
So be careful!

214
01:02:36,477 --> 01:02:39,527
It’s a very, very delicate thing; it’s
very subtle.

215
01:02:39,527 --> 01:02:46,256
And because we are gross – suddenly we become
subtle – if we do not catch up to it, we

216
01:02:46,256 --> 01:02:47,256
lose it also.

217
01:02:47,256 --> 01:02:53,617
So for one month after Realisation you have
to be very, very careful and get hold of another

218
01:02:53,617 --> 01:02:55,817
Sahaja Yogis here and we also have an ashram
here.

219
01:02:55,817 --> 01:02:58,997
We have to work it out.

220
01:02:58,997 --> 01:03:01,977
Close your eyes.

221
01:03:01,977 --> 01:03:05,946
Just close your eyes.

222
01:03:05,946 --> 01:03:08,617
It just works.

223
01:03:08,617 --> 01:03:09,777
Just close your eyes.

224
01:03:09,777 --> 01:03:11,327
Don’t think about it.

225
01:03:11,327 --> 01:03:12,327
Don’t think.

226
01:03:12,327 --> 01:03:13,440
It will work out without thinking.

227
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,837
Put both the hands towards me, please.

228
01:03:15,837 --> 01:03:20,677
Both the hands like this.

229
01:03:20,677 --> 01:03:25,137
One of the centres that is catching in most
of you is that you all feel guilty for nothing

230
01:03:25,137 --> 01:03:28,207
at all, for nothing at all.

231
01:03:28,207 --> 01:03:30,787
It’s a fashion to feel guilty.

232
01:03:30,787 --> 01:03:34,657
So everybody starts feeling guilty for nothing
at all.

233
01:03:34,657 --> 01:03:36,557
Or maybe we confess and this and that.

234
01:03:36,557 --> 01:03:41,907
Now I have to tell you that not to feel guilty
at all.

235
01:03:41,907 --> 01:03:44,037
Say that, “I am not guilty.

236
01:03:44,037 --> 01:03:45,037
”

237
01:03:45,037 --> 01:03:47,006
Thrice you say, “Mother, I am not guilty.

238
01:03:47,006 --> 01:03:48,006
”

239
01:03:48,006 --> 01:03:54,497
This is also a myth that you feel guilty.

240
01:03:54,497 --> 01:04:10,377
That will help you a lot.

241
01:05:02,053 --> 01:05:07,073
Once you get your Realisation you have to
also have the spiritual education to know

242
01:05:07,133 --> 01:05:11,083
how to handle this, how to handle this power.

243
01:05:11,133 --> 01:05:17,403
You are getting it because this is your own
right, but you must know what

244
01:05:17,463 --> 01:05:18,463
you are getting.

245
01:07:22,278 --> 01:07:26,218
They’ve got it, all of them.

246
01:08:25,072 --> 01:08:34,212
All the Sahaja Yogis should receive vibrations
and expose completely with their heart, absolutely.

247
01:08:34,212 --> 01:08:35,197
Just put it.

248
01:08:35,252 --> 01:08:38,262
Be meditative today.

249
01:08:38,262 --> 01:08:40,937
And you have to promise in your heart.

250
01:08:51,257 --> 01:08:59,983
You have to be much more active and ardent
about Sahaja Yoga if you have to save your

251
01:09:00,007 --> 01:09:04,276
brothers and sisters.

252
01:09:17,449 --> 01:09:20,860
Only your heart can be binding, nothing else.

253
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:21,860
Nothing else.

254
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:23,120
It’s only your heart.

255
01:09:33,881 --> 01:09:39,471
As you are attached to someone you love, you
should be attached to your Spirit.

256
01:09:39,531 --> 01:09:41,740
Spirit you should love the most.

257
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:45,731
Nobody is more important than your Spirit.

258
01:09:57,216 --> 01:10:00,076
Are you feeling any cool breeze in the hands?

259
01:10:00,076 --> 01:10:01,076
Not yet?

260
01:10:01,076 --> 01:10:02,249
Close your eyes.

261
01:10:02,276 --> 01:10:04,269
Have patience with yourself.

262
01:10:04,299 --> 01:10:05,899
One has to have patience.

263
01:10:08,848 --> 01:10:10,159
Close your eyes.

264
01:10:11,118 --> 01:10:12,118
Have patience!

265
01:10:12,118 --> 01:10:13,279
Just don’t think.

266
01:10:13,268 --> 01:10:14,778
It will work out.

267
01:10:14,768 --> 01:10:16,718
Have patience with yourself!

268
01:10:16,758 --> 01:10:21,745
You put both the hands towards me, not meeting
each other but towards me, separate.

269
01:10:21,745 --> 01:10:26,396
Put both the hands separately, not towards
each other but towards me.

270
01:10:26,396 --> 01:10:28,446
Please put them towards me.

271
01:10:32,944 --> 01:10:33,944
Yes.

272
01:10:34,258 --> 01:10:35,498
Close your eyes.

273
01:10:35,518 --> 01:10:36,748
Close your eyes.

274
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:37,765
And just leave it.

275
01:10:37,745 --> 01:10:38,825
Don’t think about it.

276
01:10:38,835 --> 01:10:40,278
Don’t worry about it.

277
01:10:40,295 --> 01:10:41,158
It will work.

278
01:10:41,213 --> 01:10:44,813
It’s like just a flower becoming a fruit
– spontaneously.

279
01:11:24,954 --> 01:11:30,084
Just close your eyes and put your hands towards
me. And don't think, please.

280
01:15:30,461 --> 01:15:32,710
Put your attention to your heart.

281
01:15:32,753 --> 01:15:34,683
Catch the joy part of it.

282
01:15:34,683 --> 01:15:35,683
Just heart.

283
01:15:35,683 --> 01:15:41,380
Just put your both the hands towards me only
and just pay attention to your heart.

284
01:15:41,390 --> 01:15:42,940
It will work out.

285
01:15:42,970 --> 01:15:45,110
Are you feeling cool breeze?

286
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:47,860
It’s good, great.

287
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:50,830
Just enjoy it.

288
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,820
Just enjoy.

289
01:17:28,961 --> 01:17:32,341
Do not pay attention in one particular direction.

290
01:17:32,491 --> 01:17:34,261
Just leave it free.

291
01:17:34,302 --> 01:17:36,771
Just leave it free.

292
01:17:38,961 --> 01:17:41,422
Do not fix your attention anywhere.

293
01:17:41,422 --> 01:17:42,714
Just leave it free.

294
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:43,758
It will work out.

295
01:17:57,628 --> 01:18:04,068
Gavin, organise for these people behind.

296
01:18:04,312 --> 01:18:07,173
Ask people to slowly come along.

297
01:18:07,173 --> 01:18:09,408
Keep your eyes shut.

298
01:18:09,492 --> 01:18:12,532
All new people please keep your eyes shut.

299
01:18:12,532 --> 01:18:16,561
They are going to check you.

300
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:45,690
One by one, yes move on.

301
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:49,220
Jill, come forward.

302
01:18:49,270 --> 01:18:54,930
Start moving in the centre.

303
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,460
Yes.

304
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:57,929
Good.

305
01:19:03,949 --> 01:19:09,985
Those Sahaja Yogis who want to get themselves
also checked up, ask other Sahaja Yogis to

306
01:19:10,009 --> 01:19:11,055
do it.

307
01:19:24,488 --> 01:19:31,348
Magda, I think these three people are for
the first time or what?

308
01:19:31,438 --> 01:19:35,408
Just see them, their vibrations.

309
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:45,618
They haven’t felt it yet.

310
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:53,950
Can you move a little coming up here.

311
01:19:53,950 --> 01:19:55,160
Marcus?

312
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:59,999
Or who is there?

313
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:03,720
Those who want to be checked.

314
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:08,890
Also ask others to be checked.

315
01:20:08,890 --> 01:20:13,200
Douglas, go and check Dinesh.

316
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:18,090
All of you must get checking!

317
01:20:18,090 --> 01:20:20,200
Those of you who want checking should raise
your hands.

318
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:24,940
Ask people to check you.

319
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:25,999
Check her.

320
01:20:36,753 --> 01:20:40,133
Vishuddhi, Left Vishuddhis are horrible.

321
01:20:40,184 --> 01:20:44,563
I don’t know what to say.

322
01:20:48,013 --> 01:20:52,553
Hester [Spiro], you ask somebody to check
you also.

323
01:20:52,713 --> 01:20:54,613
Peter [Pearce], you sit down.

324
01:20:54,610 --> 01:20:56,450
David [Spiro] you sit down!

325
01:20:56,450 --> 01:20:58,013
Get yourself checked!

326
01:20:58,077 --> 01:20:59,717
Linda [Pearce], Peter, all of you.

327
01:20:59,717 --> 01:21:00,717
Please.

328
01:21:00,717 --> 01:21:01,717
Because I am going away.

329
01:21:01,717 --> 01:21:04,396
Let everybody be checked – better is.

330
01:21:04,396 --> 01:21:05,396
Marcus?

331
01:21:05,396 --> 01:21:08,127
You be checked also.

332
01:21:08,127 --> 01:21:10,457
Better to get it done once for all.

333
01:21:10,503 --> 01:21:12,223
Get them checked.

334
01:21:20,603 --> 01:21:22,903
Who can check her?

335
01:21:47,335 --> 01:21:49,179
Ray [Harris]?

336
01:21:49,249 --> 01:21:50,519
Where is he?

337
01:21:50,559 --> 01:21:52,479
Go and check Hester.

338
01:21:57,152 --> 01:22:01,892
He’s got it?

339
01:22:15,763 --> 01:22:18,443
Kingsley you check Hester, it’s better.

340
01:22:18,473 --> 01:22:21,533
He (Ray) is a Jew (also) so it would be better!

341
01:22:21,593 --> 01:22:24,493
(laughing) Somebody else should do it it’s
better.

342
01:22:24,593 --> 01:22:27,773
May God bless you!

343
01:22:31,930 --> 01:22:36,040
But everybody gets checked it’s better!

344
01:22:37,903 --> 01:22:39,253
John, you sit down.

345
01:22:39,283 --> 01:22:41,123
You get yourself checked.

346
01:22:41,123 --> 01:22:41,853
Sit down.

347
01:22:41,917 --> 01:22:42,917
Marcus?

348
01:22:42,917 --> 01:22:44,647
Is he checked?

349
01:22:47,103 --> 01:22:48,213
How are they?

350
01:22:48,603 --> 01:22:52,303
Now those who are checking should get themselves
checked also, is a better idea.

351
01:22:52,393 --> 01:22:55,793
There should be nothing.

352
01:22:59,973 --> 01:23:04,423
‘Prana’ – say the mantra for him.

353
01:23:04,513 --> 01:23:09,883
For her, Malcolm [Murdoch], ‘Prana’ is
the mantra for her.

354
01:23:11,923 --> 01:23:12,923
Haa!

355
01:23:12,923 --> 01:23:13,923
Done.

356
01:23:16,723 --> 01:23:18,173
Just broken through.

357
01:23:18,173 --> 01:23:19,173
Haaa!

358
01:23:26,563 --> 01:23:29,473
Now this is to be judged a little by yourself.

359
01:23:29,513 --> 01:23:30,923
You should know.

360
01:23:30,977 --> 01:23:34,053
These are the small things that one should
know.

361
01:23:34,171 --> 01:23:36,161
This gentleman?

362
01:23:36,161 --> 01:23:42,142
Why don’t you see this gentleman?

363
01:23:42,131 --> 01:23:46,121
Can you check John.

364
01:23:49,472 --> 01:23:52,972
John, put your left hand towards me and right
hand outside.

365
01:23:53,015 --> 01:23:54,492
Felicity [Payment].

366
01:23:54,632 --> 01:24:00,652
Somebody should check Felicity also.

367
01:24:02,282 --> 01:24:06,232
Brighton people should again get themselves
rechecked afterwards.

368
01:24:06,232 --> 01:24:09,442
Everybody should get themselves rechecked.

369
01:24:09,489 --> 01:24:12,399
Somehow or other get yourself cleared out.

370
01:24:12,399 --> 01:24:14,022
Every one of you.

371
01:24:14,042 --> 01:24:16,422
Gavin you also get yourself checked.

372
01:24:16,412 --> 01:24:19,152
Everybody should get yourself checked.

373
01:24:19,154 --> 01:24:21,063
That’s the best way.

374
01:24:23,443 --> 01:24:29,724
And we should be thankful to people for checking
us and giving us vibrations.

375
01:24:29,724 --> 01:24:32,943
Instead of getting angry and upset.

376
01:24:38,954 --> 01:24:41,824
How are the children?

377
01:24:41,824 --> 01:24:43,440
Jane [Brown] bring her.

378
01:24:43,464 --> 01:24:44,640
Is she alright?

379
01:24:44,725 --> 01:24:45,800
Bring her here.

380
01:24:45,805 --> 01:24:46,740
How is it?

381
01:24:46,770 --> 01:24:48,750
Let everybody check today

382
01:24:48,770 --> 01:24:50,360
and give bandhans.

383
01:27:51,841 --> 01:27:53,851
What about this gentleman?

384
01:27:53,861 --> 01:27:54,941
He’s got it?

385
01:27:54,981 --> 01:27:57,801
He’s Ray’s father, he should get it.

386
01:28:05,531 --> 01:28:09,471
Tell him not to feel guilty about anything!

387
01:28:09,535 --> 01:28:13,201
You are facing Mother who loves you!

388
01:28:13,521 --> 01:28:16,261
Just say, “Mother I am not guilty."

389
01:28:16,311 --> 01:28:17,341
Just say that.

390
01:28:17,401 --> 01:28:20,922
What guilt can you people have?

391
01:28:21,971 --> 01:28:23,551
Jill?

392
01:28:23,551 --> 01:28:25,131
Coming?

393
01:28:59,204 --> 01:29:00,794
Haaa!

394
01:29:01,834 --> 01:29:03,611
Alright Jill?

395
01:29:04,414 --> 01:29:06,701
It’s come up.

396
01:29:10,521 --> 01:29:11,941
How is she?

397
01:29:12,083 --> 01:29:14,143
Don’t talk.

398
01:29:14,162 --> 01:29:16,123
Just raise the Kundalini.

399
01:29:16,183 --> 01:29:18,003
Just raise the Kundalini.

400
01:30:05,209 --> 01:30:09,369
You give him a bandhan.

401
01:30:09,369 --> 01:30:13,029
Chaya, tumse karab dekho.

402
01:30:13,029 --> 01:30:22,869
Regis, you also get yourself checked and others
should check and you check others.

403
01:30:22,869 --> 01:30:25,459
Every one of you.

404
01:30:30,122 --> 01:30:32,922
John, please put yourself into a bandhan.

405
01:30:32,912 --> 01:30:34,652
Now check other people.

406
01:30:34,662 --> 01:30:35,962
Come along.

407
01:30:35,942 --> 01:30:39,862
Those who have been checking sit down and
those who have to be checked.

408
01:30:41,082 --> 01:30:42,353
You’ve done it?

409
01:30:42,402 --> 01:30:43,733
Have you done?

410
01:30:43,741 --> 01:30:44,953
You’ve got it?

411
01:30:45,132 --> 01:30:47,953
Have you felt anything?

412
01:30:48,002 --> 01:30:50,083
Did you feel any cool breeze?

413
01:30:50,102 --> 01:30:51,102
Good, great.

414
01:30:51,153 --> 01:30:52,153
Now close your eyes.

415
01:30:52,153 --> 01:30:53,153
Enjoy your Self.

416
01:30:53,153 --> 01:30:54,243
Now don’t stop at that!

417
01:30:54,243 --> 01:30:57,243
What do you say Malcolm?

418
01:30:57,243 --> 01:30:58,283
Better?

419
01:30:58,283 --> 01:31:02,463
What about this child?
