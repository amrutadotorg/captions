1
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:06,954
I could not accommodate all of you in my house then I thought better to come here all of you would fit here!

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,449
And today is the last day for our Sahaj Yogis (before India Tour).

3
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:26,675
We have to understand certain very, very important
things about ourselves and our organisation that is Divine.

4
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:42,390
Now, in broad lines, I can tell you, not individual
problems and individual things because you are no more individuals now.

5
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:50,013
You have become part and parcel of the divine Being and you are awakened cells.

6
00:00:50,013 --> 00:00:59,310
And so, in a broad way we must understand what we have to do about it.

7
00:01:02,553 --> 00:01:12,512
First thing, we have to kno that we are Realised souls,

8
00:01:12,512 --> 00:01:27,705
and that you have got Realisation and that you are saints; that you have all the powers that a saint could have.

9
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:35,510
No saint ever had more powers than you have, as it is, which is manifesting.

10
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:41,159
No saint had any knowledge that you have today.

11
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:49,949
You’ll be amazed, none of the books which have been written so far have been able to

12
00:01:49,949 --> 00:01:58,500
tell you about the spiritual being that is
within you as you have come to know through

13
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,860
Sahaja Yoga.

14
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,250
One has to accept it.

15
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,279
It is so.

16
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:14,570
Any one of them, whosoever has written any
books – even, I would say, Adi Shankaracharya,

17
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,410
he could not explain so many things which
you know.

18
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:28,440
But the quality of Adi Shankaracharya is very
great, or people of his type – Markandeya

19
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,670
or Buddha.

20
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:37,010
The quality is very high because they are
extremely pure people – purity.

21
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:43,950
They have achieved individual salvation of
a very high degree.

22
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:49,720
While you have achieved your collective salvation
better.

23
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,860
But individually they are of a very, very
high quality.

24
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:59,950
I mean, they had no doubts about Divine Power,
they had no doubts about God.

25
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:05,390
They never had any doubts and they were very
dignified.

26
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,500
And they never bothered as to their petty
problems of life.

27
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,970
For them this was too petty to think about.

28
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:19,000
Anything which is so petty, we spent so much
time over it.

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:28,940
I know we had to do it because, after all,
we are human beings and are coming into Sahaja

30
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:39,500
Yoga with our human awareness and then we
got our Realisation.

31
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,000
So the purification time is very, very short.

32
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,850
And while they had such a lot of time to purify
themselves.

33
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:55,360
Now, for example, Moses was an incarnation,
a very pure form of a personality or, you

34
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,800
can say, Jesus was an incarnation, absolutely
purest form of incarnation.

35
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:12,570
But they are there to be our ideals while
what we have done is to become, from human

36
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,980
beings, a prophet.

37
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:22,589
So you understand both the things very well,
what the weaknesses human beings have, what

38
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:31,360
are their problems, how they get away from
reality, how they are deluded.

39
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,360
But still we do not use our vibratory power
as we should use.

40
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:43,640
And this is the point I want to tell you – that
you all have vibratory powers.

41
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:52,760
When we start using our vibratory powers also
we do not know what dignity, protocol we should

42
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,390
have for using this power.

43
00:04:54,390 --> 00:05:06,089
It is the power of the Deities within us and it’s a ritual by which we get their power

44
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:08,079
working in us.

45
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:18,263
As you know that people of ancient times did lot of miracles through this power but they

46
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,853
were very dignified people.

47
00:05:21,993 --> 00:05:31,836
There was no frivolousness in their character
and not useless problems within them, absolutely

48
00:05:31,843 --> 00:05:33,566
of no spiritual value.

49
00:05:33,606 --> 00:05:39,347
When you use your vibratory awareness you
should not use them for useless powers like,

50
00:05:39,347 --> 00:05:44,916
for example, going to a cinema and there’s
a traffic and you think that there’s a traffic

51
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,979
so you must use your vibratory powers to reach
that place.

52
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:50,809
Because it’s frivolous; it does not matter.

53
00:05:50,856 --> 00:05:56,546
In Sahaja Yoga it does not matter whether you go to a cinema or not.

54
00:05:56,546 --> 00:06:01,356
What matters is: what are your spiritual powers, how far you have come in your spirituality.

55
00:06:01,356 --> 00:06:04,826
It (the cinema) does not matter at all.

56
00:06:04,826 --> 00:06:11,395
You are a saint, and what saintliness you are achieving within you is the main problem.

57
00:06:11,395 --> 00:06:17,246
Otherwise, all the rest of the things that
you have, has no meaning.

58
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:21,025
Or all these problems have no meaning in spirituality.

59
00:06:21,025 --> 00:06:29,675
So, all the Sahaja Yogis must realise that you are now newly born and you are people

60
00:06:29,675 --> 00:06:33,136
of new awareness and you have to have that
dignity.

61
00:06:33,136 --> 00:06:37,176
I’ll just give an example because I was
discussing with someone today,

62
00:06:37,176 --> 00:06:43,259
that when you give somebody a sort of a bandhan, you just turn your hand like this or like that.

63
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:44,720
This is not the way it should be done.

64
00:06:45,076 --> 00:06:48,925
Your hands itself are to be respected because these are the hands of a saint.

65
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:54,715
And all the deities reside on your hands and
fingers so when you have to give them bandhan

66
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:57,285
or anything, you have to use them properly.

67
00:06:57,285 --> 00:07:03,845
Use them in such a way that it’s dignified
to do it.

68
00:07:03,845 --> 00:07:11,416
Any indignity or cheap behaviour should be
absolutely avoided.

69
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:19,745
Then dealing with each other you have to know
that you are all now in the circulation of

70
00:07:19,745 --> 00:07:20,745
Divine Power.

71
00:07:20,745 --> 00:07:24,035
You have to respect each other and really
love each other.

72
00:07:24,046 --> 00:07:27,295
You must respect because you are all saints.

73
00:07:27,355 --> 00:07:30,065
Every saint must respect another saint.

74
00:07:30,128 --> 00:07:31,937
That’s the minimum of minimum.

75
00:07:31,937 --> 00:07:38,668
And if you do not respect each other, your
chakras will go out of order, especially Vishuddhi

76
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:40,358
because it’s the collective thing.

77
00:07:40,358 --> 00:07:46,587
And also Mother’s Chakra will go out because
your sense of security is your collectivity.

78
00:07:46,587 --> 00:07:58,777
And the love between each other has to be
not only looked after but is to be nourished

79
00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:03,508
and to be worshipped and it should be a virtue.

80
00:08:03,508 --> 00:08:08,937
You should not treat each other as human beings
treat each other.

81
00:08:08,937 --> 00:08:09,937
No!

82
00:08:09,937 --> 00:08:11,848
It’s a precious thing.

83
00:08:11,848 --> 00:08:17,887
And even while talking to anyone very close
– say your brother, sister, husband, wife

84
00:08:17,887 --> 00:08:22,628
– you must respect, you must respect, otherwise,
it has no meaning.

85
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:27,767
You must respect your parents much more than
you ever respected because they are Sahaja

86
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:31,488
Yogis, because they are saints and they are
your parents.

87
00:08:31,488 --> 00:08:36,978
Respect is the keynote of relationship with
each other to begin with.

88
00:08:36,978 --> 00:08:39,758
And respect without love has no meaning.

89
00:08:39,758 --> 00:08:43,178
Respect and love for each other.

90
00:08:43,178 --> 00:08:49,178
Whether somebody is highly placed in life,
somebody is lowly placed in life, in Sahaja

91
00:08:49,178 --> 00:08:51,148
Yoga it does not matter.

92
00:08:51,148 --> 00:08:58,368
How much you earn, what is your position in
life, where you live is not important.

93
00:08:58,368 --> 00:09:02,688
The main important thing is that we are one
and we are the people who have become now

94
00:09:02,688 --> 00:09:09,118
prophets and we are the ones who have got
the powers to raise the Kundalini of others

95
00:09:09,118 --> 00:09:15,078
and such a power has come into us because
our Mother loves us very much and it is our

96
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:17,238
duty that we should love each other.

97
00:09:17,238 --> 00:09:23,048
And how I respect you?

98
00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:27,748
I need not because you know that there’s
a big gap between you and me.

99
00:09:27,748 --> 00:09:31,028
But I respect you because you are saints.

100
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:37,448
And where the saints are not respected that country goes to dogs.

101
00:09:37,448 --> 00:09:41,938
So first of all you must learn how to respect
each other.

102
00:09:41,938 --> 00:09:46,448
And that is a very, very important training
we should have.

103
00:09:46,448 --> 00:09:54,488
Whether he’s your husband or wife, whether
he’s your brother or sister, father, mother

104
00:09:54,488 --> 00:09:58,518
or child, because he’s a saint – respect!

105
00:09:58,518 --> 00:10:03,808
But I do not know how you will react to this
one that immediately you start thinking about

106
00:10:03,808 --> 00:10:06,108
people who do not respect you.

107
00:10:06,108 --> 00:10:09,978
Think how many people you do not respect.

108
00:10:09,978 --> 00:10:16,108
It’s a typical ego-oriented reaction that
immediately we start thinking, “Oh, that

109
00:10:16,108 --> 00:10:17,438
man does not respect me!

110
00:10:17,438 --> 00:10:18,438
That man does not respect!”

111
00:10:18,438 --> 00:10:23,158
But just think how many people you have not respected yourself.

112
00:10:23,158 --> 00:10:33,758
When I am not here, I am here much more.

113
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:39,768
I have not been to Australia, and you know how tremendously these people have come up

114
00:10:39,768 --> 00:10:43,268
– so pure and so good and so fantastic.

115
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:47,938
But that has not happened so much here because
I had to work, really labour here.

116
00:10:48,358 --> 00:10:50,868
Not that England is that bad.

117
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:55,421
But all the time to feel that, “Mother is
around.

118
00:10:55,439 --> 00:10:58,558
We’ll put all our problems to Her and She
can solve them.

119
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:03,589
” Even small, small problems you bring to
me – it’s all right – but now you are

120
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:08,453
capable of solving your problems as well as
solving the problems of others.

121
00:11:08,496 --> 00:11:13,596
Unless it is something fundamental you need
not bother about me and you need not also

122
00:11:13,596 --> 00:11:14,596
ask me about it.

123
00:11:14,596 --> 00:11:15,966
You can go ahead with it.

124
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:24,626
But you must think everything in the terms
of Sahaja Yoga by which – how much, by that,

125
00:11:24,626 --> 00:11:26,946
you are doing for Sahaja Yoga?

126
00:11:26,946 --> 00:11:28,756
How much you are working out for Sahaja Yoga?

127
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:31,556
This was the meeting of the Sahaja Yogis today.

128
00:11:31,556 --> 00:11:38,206
And fundamentally we have to understand one
thing: that we have to grow and we have to

129
00:11:38,206 --> 00:11:42,636
let others grow with our growth.

130
00:11:42,636 --> 00:11:45,616
Not by curbing our growth, but with our growth.

131
00:11:45,616 --> 00:11:48,496
You’ll only grow if you make others grow
with you.

132
00:11:48,496 --> 00:11:51,326
Otherwise, there will be no growth.

133
00:11:51,326 --> 00:11:59,616
Now, whatever I say goes into the books, sometimes
into the brains of the people.

134
00:11:59,616 --> 00:12:04,216
It has to go into the heart.

135
00:12:04,216 --> 00:12:09,186
The whole Sahaja Yoga system works on the
heart; that is the Spirit.

136
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:12,676
Spirit is the thing I’m talking about.

137
00:12:12,676 --> 00:12:17,446
It’s the Spirit [that] is happy by that.

138
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:23,496
Some people, I am told, are using their hands
like a weapon and all that.

139
00:12:23,496 --> 00:12:25,466
This is very dangerous!

140
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:30,406
You are not supposed to do all this for yourself.

141
00:12:30,406 --> 00:12:32,996
You are still saints, you are not yet gods!

142
00:12:32,996 --> 00:12:35,616
So don’t try such things.

143
00:12:35,616 --> 00:12:40,406
Some people have a habit of also hitting a
person with the hand like that.

144
00:12:40,406 --> 00:12:41,756
In my presence, if I say, it’s all right.

145
00:12:41,756 --> 00:12:46,136
But otherwise you should not.

146
00:12:46,136 --> 00:12:47,366
You have to respect.

147
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:57,076
Use all tender and gentle methods, never anything
by which you show any disrespect to a saint.

148
00:12:57,076 --> 00:13:03,466
Of course, you are hitting the negativity
in another person, I know that.

149
00:13:03,466 --> 00:13:09,676
But you have no business to do that or to
discard anyone or to put somebody out of this

150
00:13:09,676 --> 00:13:10,676
thing.

151
00:13:10,676 --> 00:13:13,406
You will go down very much.

152
00:13:13,406 --> 00:13:19,806
This is a serious thing one must understand.

153
00:13:19,806 --> 00:13:22,226
You have all the powers you know how far to
go.

154
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:23,996
You must keep to your maryadas.

155
00:13:23,996 --> 00:13:29,606
Don’t go beyond, because these things give
you ego, and ego is the most dangerous thing

156
00:13:29,606 --> 00:13:32,076
which we face always.

157
00:13:32,076 --> 00:13:35,256
Try to improve your language.

158
00:13:35,256 --> 00:13:36,816
Be gentle.

159
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:41,526
Be very gentle with each other.

160
00:13:41,526 --> 00:13:46,336
I expect that you’ll have many more people
by the time I come.

161
00:13:46,336 --> 00:13:48,926
I expect fantastic things from you.

162
00:13:48,926 --> 00:13:53,856
I don’t know if I should but I have given
you something so fantastic, so tremendous.

163
00:13:53,856 --> 00:13:57,376
It is unbelievable.

164
00:13:57,376 --> 00:14:05,546
I expect it from you, no doubt, because you
are specially selected and I have worked with

165
00:14:05,546 --> 00:14:07,096
you for years together.

166
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:10,406
You have got the tapes in English.

167
00:14:10,406 --> 00:14:15,486
French people, poor things, they don’t have
tapes in French and they have to be translated.

168
00:14:15,486 --> 00:14:20,816
They haven’t got a book in French and they
have big problems of understanding me.

169
00:14:20,816 --> 00:14:27,046
But how dedicated they were, how deep they
are.

170
00:14:27,046 --> 00:14:32,966
Each one of them came and said, “Mother,
I love You very much.

171
00:14:32,966 --> 00:14:33,966
I love You.

172
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:37,536
 “I have many defects and I offer myself
to You.”

173
00:14:37,546 --> 00:14:40,586
Will you accept me?”

174
00:14:40,586 --> 00:14:43,286
All of them said this way.

175
00:14:43,286 --> 00:14:44,286
Just imagine!

176
00:14:44,286 --> 00:14:50,016
I mean, I was surprised how they were saying
all these things to me and the way they were

177
00:14:50,016 --> 00:14:52,386
understanding their defects within themselves.

178
00:14:52,386 --> 00:15:01,976
Now, we have to change our mode of behaviour
towards financial, material, emotional, physical

179
00:15:01,976 --> 00:15:05,666
and all these things.

180
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:13,116
For example, say, one is married – marriages
should be successful.

181
00:15:13,116 --> 00:15:19,136
If your marriage is not successful and happy,
you are not going to be blessed, not at all.

182
00:15:19,136 --> 00:15:21,866
Try to make your marriage very happy and successful.

183
00:15:21,866 --> 00:15:23,996
That’s very important.

184
00:15:23,996 --> 00:15:27,836
Marriage is the institution established by
Adi Shakti.

185
00:15:27,836 --> 00:15:30,236
You cannot dishonour it.

186
00:15:30,236 --> 00:15:33,306
Do not play frivolously with your marriages.

187
00:15:33,306 --> 00:15:42,256
Then you must also allow the children to be
born to you so that you get great souls coming

188
00:15:42,256 --> 00:15:51,406
down on this earth by which we are giving
them a chance, a very good chance, to lead

189
00:15:51,406 --> 00:15:52,616
a very happy life.

190
00:15:52,616 --> 00:15:57,386
But if husbands, wives are not happy, and
even if Realised-souls are born, they have

191
00:15:57,386 --> 00:16:02,436
a trouble with you and they do not prosper
well and they have problems.

192
00:16:02,436 --> 00:16:08,416
So, first of all, create a family of happiness
and joy.

193
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:13,476
Some people think if they get away from Sahaja
Yogis, they’ll make a good, happy married

194
00:16:13,476 --> 00:16:14,476
life.

195
00:16:14,476 --> 00:16:16,296
It’s absolutely wrong!

196
00:16:16,296 --> 00:16:18,756
Absolutely wrong!

197
00:16:18,756 --> 00:16:24,215
If you cannot make a happy married life in
the ashram, you cannot make it anywhere else.

198
00:16:24,215 --> 00:16:26,266
First try in the ashram.

199
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:27,556
[It’s] worth trying.

200
00:16:27,556 --> 00:16:29,626
Otherwise, you cannot make it.

201
00:16:29,626 --> 00:16:33,726
Because then you understand how you share
your life with others and your married life.

202
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:38,676
Any such thing like any material thing, like
getting a house or getting this thing, that

203
00:16:38,676 --> 00:16:40,616
thing is not so important.

204
00:16:40,616 --> 00:16:45,446
Your house should be clean within yourself,
your temple of your heart.

205
00:16:45,446 --> 00:16:49,396
We are not here to build houses, not to accumulate
money.

206
00:16:49,396 --> 00:16:52,496
We are here to build our temples within ourselves.

207
00:16:52,496 --> 00:16:59,331
The real temples which are growing, which are the living temples of living God within us.

208
00:16:59,396 --> 00:17:05,126
So these material things are important up to a point, not more than that.

209
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:12,268
Most important is not how you are substantiated by Sahaja Yoga but how much you have substantiated Sahaja Yoga through.

210
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:16,466
Many people think, “We should get a good house because we have come to Mataji.

211
00:17:16,466 --> 00:17:18,902
Yes, you do get. You get good jobs. All right.

212
00:17:18,902 --> 00:17:21,342
You get it. You get your financial conditions improved.

213
00:17:21,342 --> 00:17:22,911
All right. Everything happens to you.

214
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:26,763
But how much have you given to Sahaja Yoga?

215
00:17:26,936 --> 00:17:29,536
In the way: how much have you substantiated?

216
00:17:29,536 --> 00:17:33,235
People think sometimes that if they donate money that’s sufficient. It’s not.

217
00:17:33,616 --> 00:17:43,590
To enrich it with your heart, with your lovingness, with your friendship, with your sweet understanding of each other,

218
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:48,386
enjoyment of each other’s company in the purest form, not with any purpose

219
00:17:48,386 --> 00:17:58,056
or with any intention of getting any low type of joy or low type of happiness from someone

220
00:17:58,056 --> 00:17:59,506
ego-oriented or sex-oriented.

221
00:17:59,506 --> 00:18:04,056
But it’s pure joy, pure joy.

222
00:18:04,056 --> 00:18:06,626
Purity is the theme we have to take to.

223
00:18:06,626 --> 00:18:10,696
We have to try to be purer and purer.

224
00:18:10,696 --> 00:18:20,134
And the purity will be shown brilliantly on your faces, in your behaviour, in the whole being as you would be.

225
00:18:20,134 --> 00:18:24,904
Your presence itself will show that you are Sahaja Yogis.

226
00:18:25,186 --> 00:18:26,386
You won’t have to certify.

227
00:18:26,386 --> 00:18:31,926
You won’t have to wear some special dresses to say, but people will know from your faces

228
00:18:31,926 --> 00:18:34,866
that you are saints, from your behaviour.

229
00:18:34,866 --> 00:18:39,116
You have to stand back in the last queue.

230
00:18:39,116 --> 00:18:41,366
You should be the people who should look at things.

231
00:18:41,366 --> 00:18:48,036
You should not be the first, unique, to get into the thing first, to getting into the queue first.

232
00:18:48,036 --> 00:18:52,229
No, you are the last because you are with yourself. They are not.

233
00:18:52,726 --> 00:18:54,616
They have not [got] their own securities.

234
00:18:54,616 --> 00:18:57,296
They are trying to find securities in these things.

235
00:18:57,296 --> 00:19:00,136
You have your own securities.

236
00:19:00,136 --> 00:19:09,506
Change, according to the Spirit, all your priorities, and then joy is your own.

237
00:19:09,506 --> 00:19:16,206
I really expect fantastic things from you and I hope you all will join together and

238
00:19:16,206 --> 00:19:21,346
work it out and create something fantastic.

239
00:19:21,346 --> 00:19:26,476
I don’t know how to tell individually about things but as it is I have already spoken

240
00:19:26,476 --> 00:19:31,995
to these Sahaja Yogis in Paris and I have told them that Sahaja Yoga is a very speedy

241
00:19:31,995 --> 00:19:32,995
thing.

242
00:19:32,995 --> 00:19:33,995
And it’s very speedy.

243
00:19:33,995 --> 00:19:39,589
It’s such a speed and if you do not keep with the speed of Sahaja Yoga you’ll be

244
00:19:39,696 --> 00:19:40,696
thrown out.

245
00:19:40,739 --> 00:19:43,539
You have to keep to the speed of Sahaja Yoga.

246
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:48,009
Those who cannot keep by some method or other,
or [who] get locked up by something or some

247
00:19:48,009 --> 00:19:50,359
misidentification, will drop out.

248
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:55,459
You’ll only grow when you will keep to the speed of Sahaja Yoga.

249
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:57,779
It is going to be tremendous in India.

250
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:01,159
I know these five years are going to be tremendous
in Australia.

251
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:05,609
England may be, depending on your people putting
up the speed.

252
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:10,369
It’s going to be tremendously speedy and
you have to understand that – drop out all

253
00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:18,419
your shackles and drop out all your misidentifications,
all nonsenses of fanaticism or of misidentifications

254
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:21,299
that you are British, this, that, all this.

255
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:23,659
And just become Sahaja Yogis and universal
beings.

256
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:24,659
It’s very important.

257
00:20:24,659 --> 00:20:26,599
The time has come now.

258
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:28,439
From next year it will start.

259
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:30,830
So, I wish you a very Happy New Year

260
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:35,660
and a very, very happy and cheerful Christmas. May God bless you.
