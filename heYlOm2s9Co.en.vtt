00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:10.483
Merry Christmas to you all!

00:00:32.483 --> 00:00:34.400
According to Sahaja Yoga,

00:00:36.191 --> 00:00:41.775
Christ is settled on your Agnya chakra.

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:58.400
His whole life is depicting

00:00:59.734 --> 00:01:05.734
the qualities of a person

00:01:08.025 --> 00:01:12.859
who is a realized soul

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.442
and what He has suggested

00:01:18.734 --> 00:01:22.442
in His own life is

00:01:22.734 --> 00:01:29.859
that you should not have any greed or lust.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.066
The way these days people have greedy

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.191
all over the world is really shocking.

00:01:45.483 --> 00:01:50.191
Right from the childhood,

00:01:50.483 --> 00:01:54.191
our children also learned

00:01:54.483 --> 00:01:57.567
to ask for this or ask for that.

00:01:58.567 --> 00:02:03.400
Only complete satisfaction in life

00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:08.941
can give you that equanimity, that

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:18.150
balance by which you do not hanker after things.

00:02:22.941 --> 00:02:26.650
These days even India has become

00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:32.442
very much westernised in the sense

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.775
they are also very much wanting to have this and that.

00:02:44.317 --> 00:02:51.442
Actually, now in America, suddenly with this happening,

00:02:54.734 --> 00:02:57.941
people are getting to spirituality.

00:02:59.734 --> 00:03:02.817
They come to spirituality

00:03:03.108 --> 00:03:09.609
because they think they have not found any satisfaction anywhere.

00:03:10.191 --> 00:03:13.191
But we have to see from His life,

00:03:13.483 --> 00:03:16.066
the great life of Christ.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:24.066
First He was born in a small little hut,

00:03:24.358 --> 00:03:27.358
as you saw many of them when you come round,

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.233
very much satisfied

00:03:31.525 --> 00:03:35.650
and He was put in a cradle,

00:03:35.983 --> 00:03:46.859
which was all covered with dry, very dry grass.

00:03:48.983 --> 00:03:50.400
Can you imagine?

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.317
And then He sacrificed His life on the cross.

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:04.483
Whole thing is a story of a sacrifice

00:04:04.817 --> 00:04:07.483
because He had a power,

00:04:08.983 --> 00:04:14.900
power of spirit that He could sacrifice anything.

00:04:15.233 --> 00:04:18.233
He even sacrificed His own life.

00:04:18.442 --> 00:04:26.025
So you can understand the greatness of Christ

00:04:26.317 --> 00:04:35.525
was coming from His great personality of spirituality.

00:04:42.317 --> 00:04:45.941
But the same Christ is worshipped

00:04:46.233 --> 00:04:53.233
all over the world, specially in the western countries

00:04:53.525 --> 00:04:58.108
and you'll be amazed to know how they're running after things.

00:05:00.483 --> 00:05:03.609
All their industries are running

00:05:04.191 --> 00:05:08.400
with big stories about what they make

00:05:09.525 --> 00:05:13.900
and how people boast of their wealth.

00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:19.025
They will have a cross

00:05:19.317 --> 00:05:23.442
in their necks to show that they are Christians.

00:05:23.775 --> 00:05:27.567
First of all one should never wear that cross

00:05:27.859 --> 00:05:30.275
on which Christ was crucified.

00:05:30.567 --> 00:05:36.941
But they do make up by this hypocrisy,

00:05:37.275 --> 00:05:42.025
and they are the another extreme of Christ.

00:05:45.025 --> 00:05:50.817
Not only they, but even their wives and their children

00:05:51.108 --> 00:05:54.191
are all very greedy people.

00:05:54.567 --> 00:05:57.775
They should have this, they should have that.

00:05:58.066 --> 00:06:04.275
But now India is very much in the same run.

00:06:07.525 --> 00:06:10.108
And what do they ask for?

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.817
They think by getting all these things around them,

00:06:15.859 --> 00:06:18.233
they'll be very comfortable.

00:06:18.525 --> 00:06:19.525
It's not so.

00:06:19.859 --> 00:06:22.859
They're all the time hankering

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:28.650
and they cannot even enjoy whatever they have achieved.

00:06:28.983 --> 00:06:32.775
It is something very surprising

00:06:33.066 --> 00:06:36.275
that in a country like America,

00:06:36.567 --> 00:06:41.567
where there was no corruption,

00:06:41.859 --> 00:06:48.442
but there were people who were making big, big, big money,

00:06:48.692 --> 00:06:53.609
they are supposed to be disciples of Christ.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.400
It's beyond Me.

00:07:02.692 --> 00:07:07.692
India was once upon a time a real

00:07:08.025 --> 00:07:11.025
saintly country where saints were respected,

00:07:13.317 --> 00:07:19.609
but nowadays India has fallen down

00:07:19.941 --> 00:07:28.859
to such a low level of greed

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:35.066
that impossible to understand these people.

00:07:35.983 --> 00:07:44.191
We can say they had not such a great following of Christ.

00:07:44.483 --> 00:07:48.775
And those who followed Christ, also the Christians here,

00:07:49.025 --> 00:07:51.400
they are the worst.

00:07:52.734 --> 00:07:58.609
They are the ones who have taken to all kinds of western life,

00:07:59.859 --> 00:08:04.859
of greed, and they call themselves Christians.

00:08:06.191 --> 00:08:15.692
But Christ has shown that you don't need anything in this world.

00:08:15.941 --> 00:08:23.358
He's such a great personality, such a great incarnation,

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:29.066
respected all everywhere by,

00:08:29.275 --> 00:08:36.358
because His power of sacrificing was the highest,

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:45.066
not because He was owning a big car or any big house, nothing,

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:50.066
only because He was such a humble man.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.859
His life is remarkable.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:02.442
And that today He governs the hearts of so many,

00:09:02.692 --> 00:09:09.983
despite the fact He was born a very, very poor man

00:09:10.317 --> 00:09:16.609
and was crucified also as a very poor man.

00:09:16.983 --> 00:09:22.983
So those people who are running after

00:09:23.275 --> 00:09:31.150
money are no way Christians, are nowhere near Christ.

00:09:31.483 --> 00:09:34.983
And so happy and joyous He was.

00:09:35.275 --> 00:09:38.483
And He helped the poor,

00:09:38.775 --> 00:09:41.983
He helped the needy

00:09:42.275 --> 00:09:45.066
because He understood their problems,

00:09:45.358 --> 00:09:47.859
because He could feel them.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:54.150
He tried to help all kinds of diseased people,

00:09:54.442 --> 00:09:58.817
underprivileged, while today's

00:10:00.941 --> 00:10:04.025
world has come to such a nonsense that they

00:10:04.317 --> 00:10:06.442
help countries to fight.

00:10:08.525 --> 00:10:12.525
They create Christianity to fight.

00:10:12.692 --> 00:10:15.609
What is Christianity doing in this country?

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:25.317
It's just to create a big power

00:10:27.108 --> 00:10:29.108
of creating lots of Christians.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:37.108
I've heard from many places

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.317
how they are converting people to Christianity.

00:10:44.108 --> 00:10:47.025
Christ never converted even a single soul.

00:10:49.609 --> 00:10:52.983
He wanted to give transformation,

00:10:53.317 --> 00:10:55.692
as you all have got it,

00:10:56.983 --> 00:11:00.692
but not changing the religion

00:11:01.066 --> 00:11:06.442
or changing your birthmarks, no.

00:11:08.233 --> 00:11:13.442
And what did He achieve is this kind of a useless

00:11:13.734 --> 00:11:21.025
third rate people who are running after lust and greed.

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.941
I get worried sometimes about Myself,

00:11:26.317 --> 00:11:32.400
that I hope My disciples and My children

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.692
won't do things which are against Sahaj,

00:11:37.817 --> 00:11:42.817
which are against the principle of Sahaj.

00:11:43.108 --> 00:11:47.525
And one of the principle of Sahaj is

00:11:47.817 --> 00:11:54.400
that you have to help people, those who are downtrodden,

00:11:54.775 --> 00:11:58.066
those who are not yet realized.

00:11:58.358 --> 00:12:01.442
You have to give them Realization.

00:12:02.692 --> 00:12:07.525
It is not the way world is going on,

00:12:08.525 --> 00:12:17.692
that we give help to people who are ruining this world.

00:12:19.108 --> 00:12:22.108
If we have to save this country,

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.900
if you have to save the whole world,

00:12:25.191 --> 00:12:28.609
then we have to become like Christ.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.317
Develop your sacrificing temperament.

00:12:33.609 --> 00:12:37.609
It should be very, very powerful thing

00:12:37.983 --> 00:12:41.150
because you are all realized souls.

00:12:42.483 --> 00:12:48.567
Try to develop that,

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:53.775
a temperament of helping others.

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:58.275
I've known some very great people in My life

00:12:58.817 --> 00:13:03.400
who were always willing to give

00:13:04.025 --> 00:13:07.317
to people who haven't got it

00:13:08.609 --> 00:13:13.400
and they have been of such a great

00:13:14.692 --> 00:13:19.025
temperament they were never sort of

00:13:19.317 --> 00:13:23.525
given any big award or anything,

00:13:24.609 --> 00:13:29.983
but very happy if they could help others.

00:13:33.275 --> 00:13:38.483
It's very, very sad today in this country

00:13:39.025 --> 00:13:43.734
where so many people have sacrificed their lives to

00:13:44.025 --> 00:13:46.150
achieve independence and freedom.

00:13:47.442 --> 00:13:50.150
And what is happening is now today,

00:13:50.442 --> 00:13:57.442
same people or may be their children may be, not the same,

00:13:57.734 --> 00:14:01.233
are supposed to be governing,

00:14:01.567 --> 00:14:06.066
supposed to be in charge, are making money.

00:14:09.941 --> 00:14:12.358
Why this situation has come?

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:15.567
In this country also we had

00:14:15.859 --> 00:14:19.775
many people who were extremely sacrificing.

00:14:20.066 --> 00:14:22.275
They were the leaders.

00:14:22.567 --> 00:14:27.066
But how many of you are like that?

00:14:27.358 --> 00:14:34.358
How many of you would like to give away
something of yours to others?

00:14:34.609 --> 00:14:40.108
What would you do to help others?

00:14:43.859 --> 00:14:48.692
It's very sad that the Christian nations

00:14:48.983 --> 00:14:55.275
have never followed Christ and we also are becoming the same.

00:14:57.191 --> 00:15:01.609
I don't say that we should not do business

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.525
or we should not make money.

00:15:04.859 --> 00:15:11.983
You can, but with all that you must remember

00:15:12.275 --> 00:15:14.483
for whom are you doing it.

00:15:14.775 --> 00:15:18.150
What are you going to do with it?

00:15:18.442 --> 00:15:23.066
With this money, what are you going to do?

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:31.442
Actually, we should find out at least in one year

00:15:31.692 --> 00:15:35.525
have we given up one of our things to others.

00:15:35.817 --> 00:15:41.817
Not that I say you crucify yourself, no, that's bit too much,

00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:47.817
but can you at least sacrifice a little bit

00:15:48.191 --> 00:15:52.233
of your comfort for the people?

00:15:54.650 --> 00:16:00.442
Sahaja yogis have to be extremely kind,

00:16:00.734 --> 00:16:04.150
extremely kind and loving people.

00:16:05.734 --> 00:16:08.734
If you are not that, you are not Sahaja yogis.

00:16:09.025 --> 00:16:12.692
First thing, you should be kind and loving

00:16:13.025 --> 00:16:17.692
and understanding the problems around

00:16:18.025 --> 00:16:23.025
and try to help as many people as you can.

00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:26.400
But that is not so.

00:16:26.775 --> 00:16:33.108
Even Sahaja yogis do not understand

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.983
what is the value of their life.

00:16:37.275 --> 00:16:41.191
They are on the same path as Christ was.

00:16:41.442 --> 00:16:43.525
They're realized souls.

00:16:43.817 --> 00:16:47.650
They must have that feeling.

00:16:47.941 --> 00:16:53.150
They must have that oneness with the rest of the people

00:16:53.483 --> 00:17:00.775
and they should feel the sacrifice of Christ within themself.

00:17:00.983 --> 00:17:07.983
How He sacrificed His life is to improve our Agnya,

00:17:08.275 --> 00:17:13.483
to remove our ego, to fight our ego.

00:17:13.734 --> 00:17:16.442
But we are so egoistical.

00:17:18.358 --> 00:17:24.734
Whatever He has done is a waste, is something people don't

00:17:25.108 --> 00:17:29.400
understand and they do not imbibe

00:17:29.692 --> 00:17:35.983
His character and His life. It's very bad.

00:17:37.275 --> 00:17:42.275
For us, He's a very great message

00:17:42.483 --> 00:17:46.567
for all the people who are realized souls.

00:17:46.859 --> 00:17:50.025
He's a very great example.

00:17:50.317 --> 00:17:54.025
There are so many things to be done.

00:17:55.317 --> 00:18:04.442
We have, as you know, My mind is always with the needy

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:09.983
and I've started many such organization.

00:18:10.275 --> 00:18:12.567
You know them very well.

00:18:12.859 --> 00:18:18.400
Recently I started something for the destitute women

00:18:18.609 --> 00:18:22.317
and the orphans in Delhi.

00:18:22.609 --> 00:18:25.191
I paid most of the money

00:18:25.525 --> 00:18:29.900
but, at just the finishing,

00:18:31.233 --> 00:18:33.817
I said "Why not ask Sahaja yogis

00:18:34.108 --> 00:18:37.817
to pay that little money to finish?"

00:18:38.108 --> 00:18:40.525
and they did, they did pay.

00:18:40.817 --> 00:18:45.817
In Delhi, I must congratulate them for showing the way

00:18:46.108 --> 00:18:47.191
to other Sahaja yogis.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:54.108
I was amazed how they could raise so much money

00:18:54.817 --> 00:18:59.609
for this big organization.

00:19:02.983 --> 00:19:04.859
It is something we never see,

00:19:06.191 --> 00:19:10.567
how the women are suffering in our country,

00:19:11.983 --> 00:19:14.859
how the destitute women are suffering.

00:19:15.567 --> 00:19:22.567
They're left out by their husbands for no fault of theirs, no.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:26.692
Just like that, for some whim,

00:19:26.983 --> 00:19:29.609
they are left on the street with the children.

00:19:30.941 --> 00:19:33.233
More in the Muslims it's worse.

00:19:33.567 --> 00:19:39.567
And I felt very much that I should try to do something,

00:19:40.734 --> 00:19:43.025
at least bring the attention of the people

00:19:43.317 --> 00:19:49.941
to their lot and to their problem so that

00:19:51.317 --> 00:19:56.900
they come up into life and earn their living.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.900
I think it's a duty of all the Sahaja yogis

00:20:05.275 --> 00:20:08.609
to go and see around who need your help.

00:20:08.859 --> 00:20:13.859
Just don't live for yourself, earning for yourself,

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:19.358
making money for yourself, but try to help people.

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:27.066
Help those people who can really be helped and they should say

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.400
"Is the Sahaja Yogis who have done for me."

00:20:31.525 --> 00:20:36.525
So many ideas I have of helping people

00:20:36.817 --> 00:20:43.609
and I'm going to try them with whatever money I have,

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:52.692
but I wish you could decide to do something for them.

00:20:53.025 --> 00:21:01.525
Specially this country is divided  into at least two parts,

00:21:01.859 --> 00:21:05.859
one is the rich, another is the very poor people.

00:21:07.859 --> 00:21:11.983
These very poor people just make My heart wrench,

00:21:12.275 --> 00:21:18.275
wrench with pain. I don't know how to help them.

00:21:18.567 --> 00:21:22.983
It's such a vast community.

00:21:23.275 --> 00:21:28.567
But if you people decide, you can go around.

00:21:35.941 --> 00:21:42.734
You can go around and you can find out

00:21:43.025 --> 00:21:51.442
ways and method of helping the people who are extremely poor.

00:21:53.066 --> 00:21:57.442
They need your help by all means

00:21:59.066 --> 00:22:04.066
and you are capable. With the Mahalakshmi's blessings,

00:22:04.317 --> 00:22:09.817
you are well equipped. And try to help the poor.

00:22:10.108 --> 00:22:15.400
Try to help the people who are in great trouble.

00:22:15.692 --> 00:22:17.400
I know they are not Sahaja yogis,

00:22:17.692 --> 00:22:21.692
don't expect them to be Sahaja yogis, they cannot be.

00:22:22.483 --> 00:22:26.775
At the time of Christ how many there were

00:22:27.066 --> 00:22:28.692
who were Sahaja yogis?

00:22:30.483 --> 00:22:33.692
How many people were there who could understand

00:22:33.983 --> 00:22:40.108
the depth of human problems.

00:22:41.066 --> 00:22:47.567
But Christ did and He sacrificed His life

00:22:47.859 --> 00:22:51.775
for the sins of the people. Can you imagine?

00:22:54.358 --> 00:22:58.442
It's a day to celebrate His birthday with very great joy.

00:22:58.775 --> 00:23:07.066
But what a birth and what a life that He had to go through.

00:23:09.358 --> 00:23:13.358
Nobody would like to have that kind of a life.

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:19.275
But the essence of it we must understand.

00:23:19.567 --> 00:23:22.775
Running after greed is madness.

00:23:23.066 --> 00:23:25.358
There's no end to greed.

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:29.358
Those who are greedy are greedy all the time.

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:34.859
They are asking for money, asking for this, asking for that.

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:41.066
Why not see to others, what do they want?

00:23:41.358 --> 00:23:45.150
Because we are in collective consciousness

00:23:45.442 --> 00:23:50.066
we should understand what do these people

00:23:50.358 --> 00:23:52.941
what can we do for the people.

00:23:57.275 --> 00:23:59.775
I know it's very difficult

00:24:00.066 --> 00:24:05.567
in those modern times with all the advertisements going on,

00:24:05.859 --> 00:24:12.483
but we are Sahaja yogis. We have to be normal people.

00:24:12.775 --> 00:24:20.108
We have to face it, in a way that a saint has to face it,

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:28.775
and try to eradicate all these ills by your special powers.

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:35.650
Today is a day of great joy to Me and to all of you.

00:24:35.941 --> 00:24:42.066
Also at the same time, when I see that the life of Christ,

00:24:42.317 --> 00:24:46.400
such a short life, how miserable it was.

00:24:46.692 --> 00:24:51.108
Not because of poverty, no,

00:24:51.442 --> 00:24:56.233
but because of hatred and because of tortures

00:24:56.442 --> 00:25:00.817
He had to go through.  He didn't mind poverty,

00:25:01.525 --> 00:25:04.108
He didn't write anything about it.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:13.317
What He felt bad was really the way things are wrong

00:25:15.483 --> 00:25:21.275
and the way they were oppressed

00:25:21.567 --> 00:25:27.859
and He took up all that agony onto Himself

00:25:28.191 --> 00:25:33.567
to solve the problem. He created the Christians

00:25:33.859 --> 00:25:39.066
and what they are doing is nonsense, just a nonsense.

00:25:39.358 --> 00:25:44.859
It has no meaning. It has no meaning to Christ's life

00:25:45.692 --> 00:25:52.609
and it has no meaning to the richness of His great work.

00:25:54.108 --> 00:25:56.734
So when we are celebrating His birthday

00:25:57.525 --> 00:26:04.150
we should also celebrate His sacrificing capacity,

00:26:04.442 --> 00:26:07.941
His power of loving.

00:26:09.233 --> 00:26:12.734
Now Sahaja yogis have become very good people,

00:26:13.025 --> 00:26:17.400
very loving people, no doubt about it,

00:26:17.734 --> 00:26:20.817
but still I think the greed lingers on.

00:26:21.108 --> 00:26:26.025
There's no end to greed. I must tell you,

00:26:26.358 --> 00:26:29.358
I've seen people who are so mad.

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:34.483
Like in America, they found out those people

00:26:34.775 --> 00:26:39.400
at the top of every organization, corporators,

00:26:39.692 --> 00:26:47.609
who were so rich, but they had twenty-five aeroplanes

00:26:47.817 --> 00:26:51.900
and about fifty, over fifty cars.

00:26:52.233 --> 00:26:57.108
Are they going to travel by these fifty cars?

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.400
How are they going to travel?

00:26:59.692 --> 00:27:03.692
One foot in one car and another foot in another car?

00:27:03.983 --> 00:27:08.983
But they had it, all this kind of madness

00:27:09.317 --> 00:27:14.317
and they said that - now they have nothing to say,

00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:17.983
as such, but now that's all confiscated.

00:27:19.066 --> 00:27:24.358
What will you do with all this kind of a temperament people?

00:27:24.692 --> 00:27:28.567
Isn't it madness to have twenty-five aeroplanes

00:27:28.859 --> 00:27:32.233
and about fifty motor cars?

00:27:32.567 --> 00:27:35.734
And they thought no end of themselves,

00:27:36.108 --> 00:27:37.983
stupid as they were.

00:27:38.275 --> 00:27:42.859
When they will die all this will finish.

00:27:44.191 --> 00:27:48.692
They're fighting about something in America, such a funny place.

00:27:48.941 --> 00:27:54.859
There you do understand where are we going with our greed?

00:27:55.983 --> 00:28:00.692
There's one incident where a very young girl

00:28:00.983 --> 00:28:04.567
married a very, very old man, very old.

00:28:06.191 --> 00:28:08.525
And when this old man died,

00:28:08.817 --> 00:28:14.609
he left all his money to this young lady.

00:28:15.442 --> 00:28:18.525
So the son came over and he made a case

00:28:18.817 --> 00:28:21.817
that, "I have been his son for so many years

00:28:22.108 --> 00:28:25.525
and how can this lady get all the money?"

00:28:25.817 --> 00:28:29.400
She got billions and billions,

00:28:29.692 --> 00:28:32.191
but still she wanted to have the whole,

00:28:35.442 --> 00:28:37.442
so she gave excuses

00:28:37.775 --> 00:28:40.275
saying, "I have done so much for him.

00:28:40.525 --> 00:28:42.609
With this old man,

00:28:42.941 --> 00:28:46.150
I have sacrificed so many things,"  and this and that.

00:28:47.442 --> 00:28:50.734
It's a shameless thing the way people are

00:28:51.066 --> 00:28:54.275
and they're not ashamed

00:28:54.567 --> 00:28:58.191
that they're asking for money, money, money

00:28:58.483 --> 00:29:01.400
for comfort, comfort, comfort.

00:29:01.609 --> 00:29:06.400
It's very, very difficult to understand human beings.

00:29:06.817 --> 00:29:10.400
Once they have gone in a strange way,

00:29:10.692 --> 00:29:13.817
they can go to any extent.

00:29:14.108 --> 00:29:17.483
They don't know how to sacrifice anything!

00:29:18.775 --> 00:29:24.066
When I have seen  when Gandhiji asked people to sacrifice,

00:29:25.275 --> 00:29:28.066
all the women gave away their ornaments.

00:29:30.358 --> 00:29:32.859
They gave away their lives.

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:35.941
They went to jail,

00:29:37.233 --> 00:29:40.442
did all kinds of things to achieve independence.

00:29:40.734 --> 00:29:43.734
And what is the independence they got?

00:29:45.025 --> 00:29:49.650
Immediately all the thugs of the world became in charge.

00:29:51.317 --> 00:29:54.692
All the thieves of the world became in charge.

00:29:55.025 --> 00:30:01.025
What do you say to such a country where

00:30:04.191 --> 00:30:08.775
everything that is great and noble goes into waste?

00:30:11.025 --> 00:30:13.442
Have you been a noble person?

00:30:14.734 --> 00:30:19.358
Ask yourself, have you been noble?

00:30:21.442 --> 00:30:27.150
Have you tried to help others? From the life of Christ,

00:30:28.442 --> 00:30:33.483
we have to know that He lived in poverty.

00:30:33.775 --> 00:30:40.025
He was king of kings, but He lived in poverty, with grace,

00:30:40.358 --> 00:30:51.358
and He did everything for people who were sinful,

00:30:51.692 --> 00:30:58.941
who were in trouble  such a lot, one person.

00:30:59.233 --> 00:31:07.859
Now you are so many, so many of you. You all have to do something.

00:31:08.191 --> 00:31:15.150
Don't live like these corporators,

00:31:15.442 --> 00:31:21.734
but try to know that you have to sacrifice

00:31:22.108 --> 00:31:29.108
something of your earnings, something of your luxuries

00:31:29.442 --> 00:31:34.442
for the sake of your country because you are Sahaja yogis.

00:31:34.734 --> 00:31:40.150
You are not ordinary people.  You have got your Realization.

00:31:43.817 --> 00:31:45.567
So what are you doing?

00:31:47.275 --> 00:31:51.650
Are you demanding money from everyone

00:31:52.941 --> 00:31:55.941
or you are giving love to everyone?

00:31:56.275 --> 00:32:00.734
Let Me hear the stories of Sahaja yogis

00:32:01.442 --> 00:32:06.233
who are giving love and compassion.

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:11.108
I'm sorry today on the day of His birthday,

00:32:11.317 --> 00:32:13.900
I have to tell about His

00:32:14.191 --> 00:32:18.775
life, which was very, very painful otherwise.

00:32:19.108 --> 00:32:24.734
For us to understand that such a glorious personality,

00:32:25.233 --> 00:32:28.108
such a great Sahaja Yogi,

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:34.859
He had to go through so many problems in His life

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:41.483
and His own people troubled Him.

00:32:43.775 --> 00:32:46.900
His own people tried to take advantage.

00:32:47.233 --> 00:32:52.525
I too have this experience from Sahaja yogis

00:32:52.859 --> 00:32:57.734
who got well out of Sahaja Yoga and they tried to trouble Me.

00:32:58.025 --> 00:33:01.025
They tried to make money out of Me.

00:33:01.358 --> 00:33:08.775
Everyone knows they have such a bad value system

00:33:09.108 --> 00:33:12.567
that how can you say they are realized souls?

00:33:14.817 --> 00:33:21.609
So, we have to think where we can help others,

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.400
what we can do for others.

00:33:24.692 --> 00:33:32.358
This is one of the things one has to learn from life of Christ.

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:37.442
I was actually born in a Christian family

00:33:37.734 --> 00:33:42.442
and what I found out among the Christians,

00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:46.233
that extremely they were mean, dirty people.

00:33:46.525 --> 00:33:52.859
They were planning against each other and very money-oriented.

00:33:53.108 --> 00:33:59.191
When My father went to jail, they threw us out of church.

00:34:00.483 --> 00:34:05.983
To love your country is a sin is it? They did it.

00:34:06.275 --> 00:34:10.358
And when he came back and he became the mayor of Bombay,

00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:15.150
ohh Nagpur, they were his greatest admirers,

00:34:16.483 --> 00:34:18.817
they'd take out a procession, you see.

00:34:19.108 --> 00:34:23.025
So My father just smiled at it

00:34:23.358 --> 00:34:25.609
and he said,  "See these stupid people."

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:33.900
This is complete stupidity and this kind of greed

00:34:34.233 --> 00:34:41.775
and this kind of stupidity must be stopped.

00:34:43.066 --> 00:34:47.275
They run after money, they run after positions,

00:34:47.567 --> 00:34:53.358
they run after also very bad things, some of them.

00:34:53.692 --> 00:34:56.317
Not the Sahaja yogis, but they do.

00:34:57.317 --> 00:35:00.609
But even amongst Sahaja yogis I have found people

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:04.317
who are very money-oriented,

00:35:04.692 --> 00:35:08.442
and they have made money out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:08.734 --> 00:35:14.567
I am such a useless person, I don't understand money,

00:35:14.859 --> 00:35:19.358
so they could befool Me.
All right, doesn't matter.

00:35:20.358 --> 00:35:24.066
And for years together, they were befooling Me, it's all right.

00:35:24.692 --> 00:35:27.734
Now what to do? What do I need money for?

00:35:28.734 --> 00:35:34.734
That is the trouble. The trouble is if you are not careful,

00:35:35.108 --> 00:35:38.275
if you are not very money-oriented,

00:35:38.567 --> 00:35:42.483
others can rob you. I say let them rob.

00:35:42.775 --> 00:35:46.025
Let them do what they like,

00:35:46.317 --> 00:35:49.900
but I cannot develop a temperament

00:35:50.317 --> 00:35:54.358
by which I can get after people for money, I cannot.

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:58.650
I accept whatever account you give Me.

00:35:59.025 --> 00:36:01.066
I accept whatever you say.

00:36:01.358 --> 00:36:05.066
I know it is sinful. It is wrong.

00:36:05.358 --> 00:36:08.275
If they're not aware of it, I can't help it.

00:36:09.567 --> 00:36:12.775
They all will be ruined, all such people.
I know that.

00:36:13.066 --> 00:36:17.025
But what to do, if they don't realize it themselves?

00:36:18.317 --> 00:36:21.108
Making money out of Sahaja Yoga, can you imagine?

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:29.692
Such a stupid thing to do.
It's very common, very bad.

00:36:38.609 --> 00:36:43.317
I want you all to be above money,

00:36:43.609 --> 00:36:50.692
to above all these worldly things and you will never starve.

00:36:50.983 --> 00:36:53.275
You will never have problem.

00:36:56.609 --> 00:37:03.859
But do not get mixed up with this kind of nonsensical things.

00:37:04.191 --> 00:37:09.859
This is God's work and you shouldn't make money out of it,

00:37:10.983 --> 00:37:17.525
in no way. So we have to learn a lot

00:37:17.859 --> 00:37:25.442
from the great life of Christ, who was born as a very humble man

00:37:25.775 --> 00:37:29.066
and He did such great things.

00:37:29.358 --> 00:37:34.941
He tried to improve our Agnyas

00:37:35.275 --> 00:37:40.525
and even now if you think of Him your Agnya will be all right.

00:37:40.859 --> 00:37:47.609
It will be finished.
I know among Sahaja yogis also there are people

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:51.692
who are very pushing, who are all the time pushing themselves.

00:37:52.983 --> 00:37:57.150
For what? What do you want?

00:37:57.442 --> 00:38:02.734
All the time they are pushing around

00:38:04.025 --> 00:38:06.734
just like all other stupid people.

00:38:08.025 --> 00:38:13.567
So to feel the satisfaction within yourself,

00:38:13.817 --> 00:38:19.191
just like Christ, you have to meditate

00:38:19.483 --> 00:38:25.775
and  introspect and find out, "Are you satisfied people?"

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:30.483
You have to be very much satisfied in life,

00:38:30.775 --> 00:38:34.483
otherwise no use having Sahaja Yoga,

00:38:34.734 --> 00:38:39.692
no use getting your Self-realization.

00:38:39.983 --> 00:38:47.692
I bless you from My heart that you take the character of Christ

00:38:48.817 --> 00:38:54.358
as a model for you and to understand

00:38:54.692 --> 00:38:59.859
the problems of the world, from the whole world,

00:39:00.233 --> 00:39:01.983
as your own problems.

00:39:02.983 --> 00:39:06.233
May God bless you all!
