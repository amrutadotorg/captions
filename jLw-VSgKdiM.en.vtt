AI GENERATED. To all the seekers of truth.

1
00:00:07.489 --> 00:00:08.960
As I told you before,

2
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.989
That the spirit

3
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.560
Has the nature

4
00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:16.360
Of being

5
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.520
The truth itself.

6
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.629
And this truth

7
00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:23.670
is the love of God.

8
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.649
So the

9
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.090
truth is,

10
00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:31.729
That God is love.

11
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.119
That this power that works in you.

12
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.009
Islam

13
00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:42.119
Love of God

14
00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:45.209
And love of God.

15
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.439
is purely

16
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.909
We have lost the sense of purity

17
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.250
because of our own venturesomeness.

18
00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:57.029
But purity is.

19
00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.770
Where the love has no lust,

20
00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:00.930
no greed,

21
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.419
it's innocent.

22
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.739
Like the sap in the tree

23
00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:09.150
rises.

24
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.510
Nourishes the whole tree and goes back.

25
00:01:13.449 --> 00:01:16.589
It doesn't get attached to any particular flower

26
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.989
or to any particular leaf.

27
00:01:20.339 --> 00:01:22.269
And says that I like this.

28
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.860
It's absolutely detached.

29
00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:30.680
It just nourishes and goes back.

30
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.889
Butar

31
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.519
I

32
00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:38.720
Like the rises.

33
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.099
Goes into a flower and gets lost.

34
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870
Does

35
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.839
The flower will also die.

36
00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:49.709
The tree will also die.

37
00:01:53.269 --> 00:01:54.889
And one must understand

38
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.750
that

39
00:01:56.019 --> 00:01:57.699
when you get off to realisation.

40
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.800
What

41
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.080
you have to do is,

42
00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:03.959
first of all,

43
00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:05.839
to see yourself

44
00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:07.569
how much you love others.

45
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:11.289
How much

46
00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:14.169
Your heart has opened.

47
00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.289
For

48
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.429
How much you can share.

49
00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:20.929
The individualism.

50
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.539
should drop out.

51
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.529
That is collective consciousness.

52
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.830
It doesn't mean

53
00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.789
That

54
00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:32.240
you can feel the chakras of another person.

55
00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:33.199
You can feel

56
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.899
the chakras that you have the problems.

57
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.800
You go online.

58
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.160
It means

59
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.660
that when the spirit starts shining.

60
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.690
In your attention,

61
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:45.550
first thing

62
00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:46.929
that you develop

63
00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:48.250
a great

64
00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:50.500
compassion for this.

65
00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:52.610
Human race,

66
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.460
not for the animals or for the bugs.

67
00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:58.470
Like the many vegetarians do,

68
00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.919
but for the human beings.

69
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.929
They are the epitome

70
00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:03.440
of evolution.

71
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.130
So you develop your love

72
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:09.210
for

73
00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:14.850
Other human beings because they become part and parcel of your being.

74
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.919
Now,

75
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.679
for example,

76
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.139
I think that is sick.

77
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.339
And the other finger looks after it.

78
00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:28.479
It is not doing any obligation,

79
00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:30.039
but actually it is soothing.

80
00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:32.440
Because if this is so,

81
00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:34.479
all the body comes to.

82
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:38.910
A very

83
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.210
pleasant

84
00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:41.029
state.

85
00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:43.210
If this is unpleasant,

86
00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:45.759
the whole body is in an unpleasant state.

87
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.720
So if you treat one finger,

88
00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:50.440
you are treating the whole.

89
00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:53.100
In the same way,

90
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.910
your compassion starts flowing.

91
00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:58.720
But many people have

92
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.419
Very funny ideas about compassion.

93
00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:06.720
And these must be corrected through experimentation.

94
00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:11.179
Some of the ideas of compassion are

95
00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:12.399
That

96
00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:15.740
you should worry all the time about people

97
00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:18.700
who are absolutely at the low ebb of life.

98
00:04:20.238 --> 00:04:20.760
As a mother,

99
00:04:20.798 --> 00:04:21.510
I would say.

100
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.890
You have to first mature yourself.

101
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.579
As children,

102
00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:27.760
you are still growing.

103
00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.679
That is what humility means.

104
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.589
Understand that you have to still become the spirit

105
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:34.929
in the full way

106
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.100
and just now to jump.

107
00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:43.000
The tasks of taking up very difficult cases will be very dangerous,

108
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.250
and you may get wrapped into it and your progress may stop.

109
00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:48.980
So

110
00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:50.450
As

111
00:04:50.679 --> 00:04:52.690
humble students of Zayoga,

112
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.380
first you have to learn.

113
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.049
How to

114
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.329
Master it yourself.

115
00:05:01.049 --> 00:05:04.399
To become a person who doesn't catch from other.

116
00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:08.640
Who doesn't

117
00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:11.329
get troubles from other people.

118
00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:12.269
In a way,

119
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.279
such a person has to be,

120
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.869
you know,

121
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.049
very cautious.

122
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.109
Now

123
00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:21.149
I've seen so many people.

124
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.589
They come to the programmes,

125
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.709
and they find one person who is possessed,

126
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.299
shouting,

127
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.059
screaming.

128
00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:32.510
And Sajoi who is

129
00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:34.390
Really mature,

130
00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:36.369
we'll say now you get out of this place.

131
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.429
You should not be here

132
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.839
because that person will know that everybody will be troubled by this person.

133
00:05:42.989 --> 00:05:46.380
Because this person has got a disease which will be contagious.

134
00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:49.209
All mental troubles are contagious,

135
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.510
which people do not know,

136
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.019
like psychologists.

137
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.420
They don't know that they are treating psychopaths,

138
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.489
they themselves become psychopaths,

139
00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.459
because they have no way of

140
00:05:58.859 --> 00:05:59.739
protecting themselves.

141
00:06:00.679 --> 00:06:02.869
So first of all you must protect yourself.

142
00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:05.470
And you find anybody like that,

143
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.750
but

144
00:06:06.269 --> 00:06:07.630
not go near that person.

145
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.200
At the most you can say,

146
00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:10.369
mother,

147
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.880
look after this man if you have so much of feelings.

148
00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.480
But sympathy of this kind is very dangerous.

149
00:06:17.609 --> 00:06:21.059
I call it same thing to share empathy means pathos.

150
00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:23.679
So you share the pathos of a mad man

151
00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:26.010
and you get into troubles.

152
00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:28.359
So as good children,

153
00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:29.549
I have to warn you

154
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.890
that you should get more attached.

155
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:34.049
More adhered

156
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.670
to a person

157
00:06:36.119 --> 00:06:37.040
who is

158
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.910
More evolved,

159
00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:41.149
more enlightened.

160
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.390
Instead of that,

161
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.290
people start feeling jealous

162
00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:47.880
and get ego-oriented and start fighting.

163
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.049
With a person

164
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.529
who is much better.

165
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:52.079
Now,

166
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.660
Doctor Warren,

167
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.250
as you know,

168
00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:56.089
Has achieved it,

169
00:06:56.329 --> 00:06:57.730
a very great height.

170
00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:59.600
Inside your gut.

171
00:07:01.019 --> 00:07:01.579
But

172
00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:03.529
In Australia,

173
00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:05.570
I found many people

174
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.410
who were really jealous of him for nothing at all,

175
00:07:08.859 --> 00:07:10.100
and they wanted to oust him.

176
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.250
While they themselves

177
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.500
were at the low ebb,

178
00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:17.269
and they always wanted to go to people who are at a lower ebb.

179
00:07:18.019 --> 00:07:19.450
If you have to go higher,

180
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.660
then you have to stick on to people who have gone a little higher.

181
00:07:23.269 --> 00:07:25.209
And not to go to such people

182
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.049
who are at a low ebb,

183
00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:28.510
while they can

184
00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:30.570
come up only by looking up.

185
00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.519
So you cannot bring them by going down to them.

186
00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.070
So those people who have got realisation for the first time,

187
00:07:38.359 --> 00:07:39.480
who have just touched it,

188
00:07:39.679 --> 00:07:41.230
should not suddenly start thinking.

189
00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:44.109
Now they have become the great evolved people.

190
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:46.760
They have to grow,

191
00:07:47.019 --> 00:07:48.369
grow like trees

192
00:07:48.899 --> 00:07:49.390
and

193
00:07:51.089 --> 00:07:51.980
Acquire

194
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.820
The knowledge

195
00:07:54.109 --> 00:07:55.549
of their powers.

196
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:56.140
For example,

197
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:57.899
if I entered into one room,

198
00:07:58.109 --> 00:07:59.880
that doesn't mean that I have gone to all,

199
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.029
all the rooms.

200
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:04.390
That doesn't mean that I know what's happening in other rooms.

201
00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:07.809
So for a person who has got realisation

202
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.200
has to be humble about it,

203
00:08:10.519 --> 00:08:13.399
that I have to see more and I have to know more.

204
00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:14.279
I have to be better.

205
00:08:15.049 --> 00:08:16.720
This attitude helps a lot

206
00:08:16.929 --> 00:08:18.079
in their growth.

207
00:08:18.329 --> 00:08:19.209
And once

208
00:08:19.529 --> 00:08:20.489
you have achieved

209
00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:21.809
the higher state,

210
00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:23.290
which we call as

211
00:08:23.959 --> 00:08:24.769
Nirviculpur

212
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.029
means doubtless awareness.

213
00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:28.399
After that,

214
00:08:28.559 --> 00:08:29.679
you yourself

215
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:30.809
can start.

216
00:08:32.258 --> 00:08:32.629
With

217
00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:34.400
Great

218
00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:36.450
enthusiasm,

219
00:08:36.979 --> 00:08:37.950
helping people.

220
00:08:38.879 --> 00:08:41.308
Those who are much lower than you.

221
00:08:42.698 --> 00:08:44.129
This is one of the reasons

222
00:08:44.539 --> 00:08:47.179
many people who come to Sergioga go down.

223
00:08:47.989 --> 00:08:50.039
And take a lot of time to come up.

224
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.039
Surgical guy is becoming.

225
00:08:52.409 --> 00:08:55.729
It is not that you can make somebody a plastic surgeon.

226
00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:57.960
You cannot give a

227
00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:58.760
certificate.

228
00:08:58.809 --> 00:08:59.169
All right,

229
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.659
now you are a soul.

230
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.530
It is you who has to certify yourself.

231
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.210
It is you who has to grow up,

232
00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:10.669
and it is you who has to master.

233
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.320
It is you who knows

234
00:09:13.679 --> 00:09:16.070
whether you have got it or not.

235
00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:21.640
So you have to have due respect for yourself and for others.

236
00:09:22.349 --> 00:09:24.250
The second problem arises

237
00:09:24.659 --> 00:09:26.820
that a person becomes bumptious.

238
00:09:28.299 --> 00:09:30.750
And starts quarrelling with surge,

239
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.840
taking sides of people who are negative.

240
00:09:34.609 --> 00:09:36.799
People who are not yet anywhere

241
00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:40.169
is also a common sight I have seen with many people.

242
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:42.429
So one should see

243
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.710
what changes have come in me.

244
00:09:45.359 --> 00:09:48.130
What transformation has taken place in me.

245
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.710
One can even write a diary to see how I become more compassionate,

246
00:09:53.239 --> 00:09:54.299
how I become

247
00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.869
more tolerant,

248
00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.270
how I become much more nourishing.

249
00:09:58.559 --> 00:10:00.479
Can I share things with others?

250
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:05.219
Do I enjoy the company of others

251
00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:07.869
and the company of Sadis,

252
00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:11.260
but that doesn't mean that you have to enjoy

253
00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.419
the company of the people who are not realised

254
00:10:14.669 --> 00:10:15.140
and

255
00:10:15.469 --> 00:10:18.349
not to enjoy the company of the people who are realised.

256
00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:22.520
In India we have very good saints and very

257
00:10:23.099 --> 00:10:23.900
Their life source

258
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:27.099
and their idea about human beings

259
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:33.400
is very sad because they think that human beings can never understand

260
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:34.419
that

261
00:10:34.789 --> 00:10:36.260
when they have to grow up,

262
00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:38.869
they have to grow up with humility.

263
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:42.520
Like a student has to learn from a professor.

264
00:10:42.969 --> 00:10:45.099
You have to learn from your kundalini

265
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:46.440
how to grow,

266
00:10:46.809 --> 00:10:49.289
how to become better by watching yourself.

267
00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:52.739
They think that unless and until

268
00:10:53.469 --> 00:10:57.539
the guru is very strict actually like the gurus you have in the market,

269
00:10:57.859 --> 00:10:58.539
they are not.

270
00:10:58.669 --> 00:11:00.460
They're very different type of people.

271
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:03.549
They are terribly hard task masters.

272
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.520
If you see their methods are so horrifying

273
00:11:06.869 --> 00:11:08.979
that I shudder to send anyone to them.

274
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.090
Once I had sent one gentleman,

275
00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:12.320
he had told me

276
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:13.549
there was one guru

277
00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:17.179
called as Gagan Gan Maharaj who is a real guru.

278
00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:18.419
And

279
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:19.390
he's very well known,

280
00:11:19.429 --> 00:11:20.820
but he lives in the jungles

281
00:11:21.109 --> 00:11:21.750
and

282
00:11:22.109 --> 00:11:22.940
his legs

283
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:26.340
are broken and hands are broken by human beings,

284
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:27.979
and he's carried by

285
00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:28.979
a tiger.

286
00:11:30.599 --> 00:11:31.299
So he told me,

287
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:31.580
Mother,

288
00:11:31.659 --> 00:11:32.280
if you,

289
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.049
if anybody troubles you,

290
00:11:34.099 --> 00:11:36.619
if you are in difficulties with somebody who is very troublesome,

291
00:11:36.659 --> 00:11:37.700
you send him over to me.

292
00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:39.919
So

293
00:11:40.049 --> 00:11:40.330
I said,

294
00:11:40.369 --> 00:11:40.969
all right.

295
00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.369
The one gentleman was very torturesome.

296
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:48.159
He used to ask questions after questions like mad and very troublesome fellow,

297
00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:49.090
very ego-oriented.

298
00:11:49.929 --> 00:11:50.969
So just I said,

299
00:11:51.049 --> 00:11:51.210
all right,

300
00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.239
you go and see

301
00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:53.440
this guru.

302
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.559
Now this guru doesn't see people at all,

303
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.359
so he felt very enamoured as he goes,

304
00:11:57.409 --> 00:11:57.739
pampered,

305
00:11:57.809 --> 00:11:58.169
Oh God,

306
00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.359
the guru has called me something great.

307
00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:02.280
So he went to that guru.

308
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:04.950
After a month he came back.

309
00:12:06.289 --> 00:12:07.859
I like there was a big passage.

310
00:12:08.729 --> 00:12:10.640
And his legs were on his neck.

311
00:12:11.619 --> 00:12:15.580
And they were ringing him as if dangling towards me.

312
00:12:15.869 --> 00:12:16.590
I looked at him.

313
00:12:17.409 --> 00:12:20.039
I couldn't bear it and tears came into my eyes.

314
00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:20.559
I said,

315
00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:21.640
what has happened to you?

316
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:22.770
He said,

317
00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:23.270
Mother,

318
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.260
I'm sorry for what I did.

319
00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:25.530
I said,

320
00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:26.099
What happened?

321
00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:27.200
He said,

322
00:12:27.239 --> 00:12:27.890
you see

323
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:29.520
When I went there,

324
00:12:30.549 --> 00:12:31.260
I

325
00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:32.570
was rather

326
00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.520
bad because I told against you to the guru.

327
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:35.849
I said,

328
00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:37.130
what did you tell against the guru?

329
00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:37.929
He said,

330
00:12:37.969 --> 00:12:40.609
I told that mother is giving realisation to every Tom,

331
00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:41.570
Dick and Harry,

332
00:12:41.969 --> 00:12:43.690
and she should really first of all

333
00:12:43.809 --> 00:12:46.320
very fine and then give realisation and this and that.

334
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:48.010
And I was talking ill about it.

335
00:12:49.109 --> 00:12:49.510
He said,

336
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:49.770
yes,

337
00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:51.109
you are wiser than mother,

338
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:52.200
isn't it?

339
00:12:52.619 --> 00:12:54.159
And then in the night,

340
00:12:54.409 --> 00:12:54.960
the

341
00:12:55.729 --> 00:12:57.780
tiger came and threw me in a cart.

342
00:12:58.659 --> 00:13:00.450
And fell down 14 ft.

343
00:13:02.119 --> 00:13:03.190
And then this guru,

344
00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:03.729
Lord.

345
00:13:05.669 --> 00:13:06.320
Uh

346
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:07.950
bread

347
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.200
after 3 days.

348
00:13:10.349 --> 00:13:11.469
And ask

349
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:13.599
That

350
00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:19.369
You can eat this food but stay there.

351
00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:22.309
And I was lying there for 5 days,

352
00:13:22.429 --> 00:13:24.789
and every day he used to lower.

353
00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:29.840
Bread for him,

354
00:13:30.369 --> 00:13:31.320
and he was there.

355
00:13:32.229 --> 00:13:34.270
All filled with filth and everything.

356
00:13:35.469 --> 00:13:36.809
After 5 or 6 days,

357
00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:38.900
he sent 3 or 4 people to pick him up.

358
00:13:40.739 --> 00:13:41.369
And

359
00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:42.609
when he came up,

360
00:13:42.989 --> 00:13:44.969
he asked them to give him a bath and all that,

361
00:13:44.979 --> 00:13:45.969
and it changed.

362
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:48.090
And then he told

363
00:13:48.349 --> 00:13:49.380
that you put these

364
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:50.619
legs

365
00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.059
around your neck

366
00:13:52.349 --> 00:13:53.630
and go down into mother.

367
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:54.539
She's the one who will

368
00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:55.630
put you right,

369
00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:56.580
not me.

370
00:13:56.789 --> 00:13:58.979
And if you ever say a word against mother,

371
00:13:59.280 --> 00:13:59.690
then

372
00:13:59.989 --> 00:14:03.150
I will break your legs in such a way that you'll never be able to fix them.

373
00:14:04.049 --> 00:14:05.090
Poor fellow he was.

374
00:14:06.309 --> 00:14:06.849
Shat

375
00:14:08.919 --> 00:14:09.739
And he came to me,

376
00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:10.330
Mother,

377
00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:11.770
it was too much.

378
00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:12.450
Of course,

379
00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:13.500
his legs were fixed.

380
00:14:13.539 --> 00:14:14.099
He's all right.

381
00:14:14.179 --> 00:14:15.489
He's a good fellow now,

382
00:14:16.059 --> 00:14:17.880
but that is what they do

383
00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:19.169
because according to them,

384
00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.409
unless and until you take them to task,

385
00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:23.090
you cannot humble them down.

386
00:14:23.619 --> 00:14:24.340
Like another fellow,

387
00:14:24.419 --> 00:14:25.700
I sent him to another fellow.

388
00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:31.219
Who was a doctor and who really bother me too much,

389
00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:34.179
but I just told him to go and see this particular guru.

390
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:35.940
So when the doctor came back,

391
00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:37.340
he was thin like steaks.

392
00:14:37.419 --> 00:14:37.630
I said,

393
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:38.619
What has happened?

394
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:40.520
Didn't he not give you food to eat?

395
00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:41.630
No,

396
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:41.830
mother,

397
00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:42.640
he gave me food,

398
00:14:42.679 --> 00:14:43.219
all right.

399
00:14:43.359 --> 00:14:44.650
She was very affixiate.

400
00:14:44.919 --> 00:14:45.489
But what happened?

401
00:14:45.559 --> 00:14:46.809
Why did you lose so much weight?

402
00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:47.750
What has happened to you?

403
00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.349
You are looking so very thin.

404
00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.190
So he was staying about

405
00:14:51.729 --> 00:14:52.359
7 miles,

406
00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.869
one had to back walk up.

407
00:14:54.989 --> 00:14:59.200
And every day he had to carry two buckets of water

408
00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:01.809
to clean one dilapidated temple.

409
00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:06.289
Every day he was supposed to take that and clean it.

410
00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:07.820
So I asked this guru,

411
00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.929
what do you mean by torturing him like this,

412
00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.340
taking these two buckets to clean the thing.

413
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:12.770
He said,

414
00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:13.500
for a donkey,

415
00:15:13.539 --> 00:15:15.010
you must give donkey's work.

416
00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:19.570
I'm not a mother to look after these oriented people.

417
00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.520
It's better that he's trash now.

418
00:15:21.539 --> 00:15:22.580
He'll be better off.

419
00:15:23.659 --> 00:15:24.619
So this is not

420
00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:25.900
the way they think

421
00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:27.460
people can be taught,

422
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:30.940
and they are to learn their lessons of spirituality in this way.

423
00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:32.200
Even when

424
00:15:32.469 --> 00:15:33.309
you go to them,

425
00:15:33.469 --> 00:15:35.380
they'll test you in so many ways

426
00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:37.950
that you absolutely get.

427
00:15:40.789 --> 00:15:41.520
Fed up

428
00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:45.059
and you leave them and they are very happy that you have left them forever.

429
00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:49.210
They are never anxious that you should be close to them because it is a thankless job.

430
00:15:49.219 --> 00:15:49.640
Otherwise,

431
00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:50.479
if you see,

432
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:53.020
If you don't take any money,

433
00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:54.580
you are never rewarded.

434
00:15:54.789 --> 00:15:56.859
People try to always boss over you.

435
00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:59.739
So they think that it's better for us to put them right.

436
00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:00.940
Let them learn

437
00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:02.909
that you have to go hard way.

438
00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.179
To be the spirit.

439
00:16:06.409 --> 00:16:08.820
But er yoga today is not like that.

440
00:16:09.989 --> 00:16:10.469
As a mother,

441
00:16:10.549 --> 00:16:11.229
I thought,

442
00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:14.789
let these children who are already under pressure and tension

443
00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.770
receive their realisation.

444
00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:18.690
Let them have their realisation.

445
00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:23.419
Let them have their light and let them see what's wrong with them.

446
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.619
Then they start seeing their ego.

447
00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:27.640
They start seeing their super ego.

448
00:16:27.909 --> 00:16:29.859
They start seeing their conditionings.

449
00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:34.099
They start seeing their problems and gradually when they see it,

450
00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:36.739
they can cleanse it if you tell them how to cleanse it,

451
00:16:36.789 --> 00:16:37.869
and they work it out.

452
00:16:38.609 --> 00:16:40.650
So after realisation,

453
00:16:40.969 --> 00:16:44.479
it is very important how you look after yourself.

454
00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:45.559
You may be a king,

455
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:46.510
you may be anything,

456
00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:48.390
makes no difference in the

457
00:16:49.559 --> 00:16:50.500
Realm of God,

458
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.270
the one who is evolved so is respected,

459
00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:57.849
not the person who just is a big man or something,

460
00:16:57.869 --> 00:17:00.200
a big politician has no place.

461
00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.309
Only thing is who is more evolved.

462
00:17:04.098 --> 00:17:06.660
Even a simple person on the street

463
00:17:07.098 --> 00:17:09.969
can come to Sergioga and can rise very high.

464
00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:15.530
And a person who comes in a big car and a big way and tries to all the time.

465
00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.030
Impress upon me

466
00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:20.079
the greatness of his worldly

467
00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:21.810
treasures.

468
00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:22.489
does not reach.

469
00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.510
So in the eyes of God,

470
00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:28.089
it is not important what you are in life,

471
00:17:28.199 --> 00:17:29.530
what your ego tells you,

472
00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.010
what you think of yourself,

473
00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.099
but it is God's judgement

474
00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:37.140
that he sees how far you are in realisation.

475
00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.780
And in realisation

476
00:17:38.959 --> 00:17:42.420
you have to judge yourself through your vibratory awareness.

477
00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.380
When this awareness stations up properly

478
00:17:46.839 --> 00:17:50.150
and you really become absolutely endowed with it,

479
00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:51.359
the joy.

480
00:17:52.449 --> 00:17:54.959
Of Sahijoga starts sticking in your

481
00:17:55.569 --> 00:17:55.949
existence.

482
00:17:56.089 --> 00:17:57.260
People can see

483
00:17:57.569 --> 00:17:58.959
those who never laughed

484
00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:00.300
started

485
00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:01.609
laughing aloud.

486
00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.400
Feeling the joy of life,

487
00:18:04.479 --> 00:18:06.660
the whole drama becomes

488
00:18:07.239 --> 00:18:08.199
sometimes a comedy,

489
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.650
sometimes a tragedy,

490
00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.510
and you start seeing the whole drama as a witness.

491
00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.250
And when this happens,

492
00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.599
then a person really,

493
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:17.959
really enjoys

494
00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:19.349
the beauty

495
00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.589
of their spirit.

496
00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.410
But those who think

497
00:18:22.719 --> 00:18:25.959
that they are great and they have read this book and they

498
00:18:25.959 --> 00:18:29.000
have been to this school or they have done this great job.

499
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:30.719
They must know that

500
00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:32.520
it is not counted at all.

501
00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:36.239
It is how you are within yourself.

502
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:41.930
Where are your vibrations and what are the chakras you have opened out?

503
00:18:42.209 --> 00:18:43.959
How much large you have grown.

504
00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:47.560
That is how a person is known by his evolution.

505
00:18:47.969 --> 00:18:49.989
You are all seekers of ages.

506
00:18:50.329 --> 00:18:52.060
You are not a seeker of today.

507
00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:56.500
You have been seeking in previous lives and many lives before,

508
00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:58.569
and so you are here today

509
00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:02.780
to seek the truth and the truth is to be faced as the truth is.

510
00:19:02.989 --> 00:19:06.760
You cannot force the truth to be like you want to be like some people say,

511
00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:07.430
but mother,

512
00:19:07.469 --> 00:19:08.939
I still like this.

513
00:19:09.069 --> 00:19:09.780
Then go ahead.

514
00:19:10.569 --> 00:19:11.619
I don't say no.

515
00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.180
I never say no to anything.

516
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:13.699
I said,

517
00:19:13.709 --> 00:19:14.189
go ahead.

518
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.020
And they then learned a lesson.

519
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:17.819
Like one day I'll tell you about Dr.

520
00:19:17.949 --> 00:19:18.660
Warren himself,

521
00:19:18.709 --> 00:19:20.020
a very interesting story.

522
00:19:20.109 --> 00:19:23.310
It happened only a few days back when we were in Singapore.

523
00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.770
I just tried some tricks and

524
00:19:25.939 --> 00:19:26.770
make them learn.

525
00:19:26.979 --> 00:19:28.699
Like there's another nice lady,

526
00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:32.300
very nice lady who is very involved and all that.

527
00:19:32.959 --> 00:19:36.069
And she got after him that we must go now to Kuala

528
00:19:36.069 --> 00:19:38.979
Lumpur because she lives in Kuala Lumpur and she was worried about

529
00:19:39.189 --> 00:19:40.500
the meetings and this and that,

530
00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:44.540
and I had told them that I'm going out and I'll be coming back and we'll all go together

531
00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:46.390
because there's a shuttle service all the time and

532
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.579
I said we'll go by the evening plane,

533
00:19:48.819 --> 00:19:49.780
but they wanted,

534
00:19:49.989 --> 00:19:54.349
she wanted to go 2 hours earlier and she was after him that you better come along.

535
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:56.250
Mother has a ticket and she'll come along.

536
00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.579
And there were other people with me.

537
00:19:59.089 --> 00:20:01.719
So these went just to organise everything.

538
00:20:01.849 --> 00:20:02.770
2 hours earlier,

539
00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:04.310
I left the plane.

540
00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:05.530
When they went there,

541
00:20:05.619 --> 00:20:06.369
they reached all right,

542
00:20:06.439 --> 00:20:07.060
2 hours.

543
00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:08.949
Uh,

544
00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:11.209
but when I arrived

545
00:20:11.819 --> 00:20:12.550
at the

546
00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:13.579
hall,

547
00:20:14.099 --> 00:20:16.349
what I find that they were getting down

548
00:20:16.739 --> 00:20:18.010
from their car

549
00:20:18.619 --> 00:20:21.449
means they arrived even later than I had arrived,

550
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:25.410
and I thought they'll be now very much embarrassed to see me getting down with them.

551
00:20:25.619 --> 00:20:26.640
So I asked the driver,

552
00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:27.020
I said,

553
00:20:27.099 --> 00:20:29.569
let us go ahead till they come out of the car.

554
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:30.319
I

555
00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:33.300
I asked them what had happened.

556
00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:35.939
They said that we got down all right,

557
00:20:36.109 --> 00:20:37.550
but on the way there was a big jump.

558
00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.050
And we didn't know how to go,

559
00:20:40.079 --> 00:20:42.469
so we thought better take another road.

560
00:20:42.719 --> 00:20:43.560
So we came

561
00:20:43.959 --> 00:20:46.280
out from the pavement on the sides.

562
00:20:47.349 --> 00:20:48.979
And when we came out,

563
00:20:50.339 --> 00:20:51.390
There was all,

564
00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:51.660
uh,

565
00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.510
we found that this was all

566
00:20:53.959 --> 00:20:55.739
filled with mud.

567
00:20:56.239 --> 00:20:57.609
So the car got stuck

568
00:20:57.959 --> 00:20:58.739
in the mud,

569
00:20:59.119 --> 00:21:01.859
and they had to pull it out and all sorts of things had to be done,

570
00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:05.000
and they reached a little later than when I had arrived.

571
00:21:05.969 --> 00:21:06.959
Then she realised,

572
00:21:06.969 --> 00:21:07.280
she said,

573
00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:07.900
yes,

574
00:21:08.209 --> 00:21:11.810
that Warren was telling me all the time that you shouldn't do something that

575
00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:14.609
mother has said we should go with her because she looks after everything,

576
00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:15.880
so why should we worry?

577
00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:16.760
So like that,

578
00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:19.449
you see little little incidents start occurring

579
00:21:19.449 --> 00:21:21.800
in your life and you start understanding

580
00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:24.680
that we are unnecessarily worried.

581
00:21:24.849 --> 00:21:25.800
Like sometimes,

582
00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:27.359
as our habits are,

583
00:21:27.569 --> 00:21:27.959
we

584
00:21:28.369 --> 00:21:29.760
want to go to the airport

585
00:21:30.189 --> 00:21:31.520
even before the

586
00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:33.319
aeroplane is fitted there.

587
00:21:33.609 --> 00:21:33.810
I mean,

588
00:21:33.849 --> 00:21:35.010
we are so futuristic.

589
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.880
And there are people always with me who are of that time,

590
00:21:39.119 --> 00:21:40.280
and they get after my

591
00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:41.189
life

592
00:21:41.439 --> 00:21:41.640
saying,

593
00:21:41.719 --> 00:21:41.880
Mother,

594
00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:42.829
you should get ready now.

595
00:21:42.839 --> 00:21:43.319
We have to go,

596
00:21:43.359 --> 00:21:44.069
we have to go.

597
00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.439
And they become so quite wobbly.

598
00:21:45.479 --> 00:21:45.719
I said,

599
00:21:45.839 --> 00:21:46.000
all right,

600
00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:46.880
to put you at rest,

601
00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:47.319
I'll come.

602
00:21:48.219 --> 00:21:49.630
But there's nothing going to happen.

603
00:21:49.719 --> 00:21:50.709
We are just in time.

604
00:21:50.839 --> 00:21:51.410
Don't you worry.

605
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.229
So we reached the airport and then they say,

606
00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.750
suddenly the plane is delayed by 2 hours.

607
00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:01.319
So they can't understand the plane was not delayed and why the plane is delayed now.

608
00:22:01.489 --> 00:22:02.819
Now I said now it's settled now.

609
00:22:03.369 --> 00:22:04.719
Fix your left navi,

610
00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:09.119
fix your wobbly nature and let us work it out at the airport.

611
00:22:09.489 --> 00:22:10.599
This is what it is.

612
00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:11.719
One has to

613
00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:14.239
slowly and steadily understand

614
00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:18.650
that the God who has created this great universe is the one

615
00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:19.810
looking after.

616
00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:22.939
He is the one who is looking after us.

617
00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:24.859
His angels are around us.

618
00:22:25.349 --> 00:22:29.339
They all look after all the realised souls who are on this earth.

619
00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:31.189
All the beautiful.

620
00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.099
Mutambara Praga,

621
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:35.719
that is the uh knowledge

622
00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:37.569
of the enlightened

623
00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:38.800
mind.

624
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760
About

625
00:22:41.829 --> 00:22:42.380
The

626
00:22:44.439 --> 00:22:45.530
Seasons

627
00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:46.599
of beauty.

628
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:50.589
They start enjoying it.

629
00:22:51.369 --> 00:22:52.910
And when it happens to you.

630
00:22:54.319 --> 00:22:55.630
If it happens to you,

631
00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.959
you just don't worry

632
00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:01.459
because you understand that everything is laid bare before

633
00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.109
and it has happened with so many people,

634
00:23:04.319 --> 00:23:06.930
but there could be another person who may not accept

635
00:23:07.199 --> 00:23:07.540
and say,

636
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:07.640
no,

637
00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:07.760
no,

638
00:23:07.849 --> 00:23:07.920
no,

639
00:23:07.959 --> 00:23:08.040
no,

640
00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:08.199
no,

641
00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:08.359
no,

642
00:23:08.479 --> 00:23:09.760
we must be very careful,

643
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:13.760
we must do this and this and start worrying the same way they have been worried.

644
00:23:14.859 --> 00:23:17.229
Actually some people get upset even if you mention

645
00:23:17.229 --> 00:23:18.599
them that you have to go to the airport.

646
00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:19.469
I've seen that.

647
00:23:19.959 --> 00:23:20.630
And then

648
00:23:20.839 --> 00:23:23.199
they find that they are losing their passports,

649
00:23:23.239 --> 00:23:24.630
they're losing this and they are

650
00:23:24.959 --> 00:23:26.150
getting so wobbly.

651
00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.119
Inside your,

652
00:23:27.319 --> 00:23:27.800
first of all,

653
00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.189
you must steady yourself.

654
00:23:29.599 --> 00:23:31.630
You must try to steady yourself.

655
00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:32.209
Put

656
00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.680
your left nay,

657
00:23:33.689 --> 00:23:34.510
as they say,

658
00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.319
here is the nay.

659
00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:37.589
This one

660
00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:39.680
is to be put at ease.

661
00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:40.939
It's very important

662
00:23:41.359 --> 00:23:43.040
because if it is not at ease.

663
00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.900
Then also there is a possibility

664
00:23:46.079 --> 00:23:49.989
of you heading for some sort of a very serious disease like you can.

665
00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:52.500
As I told you the other day,

666
00:23:52.589 --> 00:23:54.819
that with the overactivity of

667
00:23:55.109 --> 00:23:56.349
this centre,

668
00:23:56.949 --> 00:23:58.099
on the left-hand side,

669
00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:02.219
people might develop leukaemia because your spleen becomes hectic,

670
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:03.619
it becomes very,

671
00:24:03.949 --> 00:24:04.579
uh,

672
00:24:04.709 --> 00:24:05.420
nervous.

673
00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:09.119
And it becomes crazy actually because you are doing 10

674
00:24:09.119 --> 00:24:12.109
things at the same time and you are yourself crazy.

675
00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:13.469
So this

676
00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:14.790
becomes crazy.

677
00:24:14.959 --> 00:24:20.000
It starts producing malignant cells and you develop a disease called the kid.

678
00:24:21.329 --> 00:24:22.380
So first of all,

679
00:24:22.469 --> 00:24:23.709
you must put yourself

680
00:24:24.189 --> 00:24:25.630
to a peaceful life.

681
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:27.199
Now,

682
00:24:27.209 --> 00:24:28.060
how do you do it?

683
00:24:28.209 --> 00:24:28.699
First of all,

684
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:29.569
believe

685
00:24:29.969 --> 00:24:30.439
that

686
00:24:30.609 --> 00:24:32.810
you are not going to miss anything in life.

687
00:24:33.719 --> 00:24:34.479
Even if you miss,

688
00:24:34.489 --> 00:24:37.020
supposing you think that you have to miss it.

689
00:24:37.359 --> 00:24:38.150
Like once

690
00:24:38.439 --> 00:24:41.310
at the airport we reached and the

691
00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.829
plane was late for 5 hours

692
00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.150
in Bombay.

693
00:24:46.189 --> 00:24:48.420
And in Bombay people know me very well.

694
00:24:48.739 --> 00:24:50.900
They came to know that I'm at the airport

695
00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.689
right from pilots

696
00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:54.089
to the loaders,

697
00:24:54.619 --> 00:24:56.530
everybody came there to get realisation,

698
00:24:56.739 --> 00:25:00.689
and about 500 of them came down and they got their realisation.

699
00:25:00.939 --> 00:25:02.969
So my sitting there was important.

700
00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.170
My doing that work was important,

701
00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:08.229
so the plane was late and everybody enjoyed it.

702
00:25:08.619 --> 00:25:09.849
So to get upset

703
00:25:10.479 --> 00:25:13.609
about what you have thought that you are going to do next moment.

704
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.369
And when you don't do it,

705
00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:16.069
then you feel,

706
00:25:16.109 --> 00:25:16.579
oh God.

707
00:25:18.589 --> 00:25:23.390
The whole joy is finished because people live with futuristic ideas.

708
00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:25.609
The whole future they built in beforehand

709
00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:28.180
and they expect that future to happen

710
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:30.030
and when that future doesn't happen,

711
00:25:30.109 --> 00:25:31.069
they become miserable.

712
00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:31.969
Actually,

713
00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:33.719
Sergio you are in the present,

714
00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:35.239
you are never in the future.

715
00:25:35.569 --> 00:25:37.199
Absolutely silent

716
00:25:37.489 --> 00:25:38.079
and

717
00:25:38.329 --> 00:25:40.119
absolutely peaceful with yourself.

718
00:25:40.209 --> 00:25:41.599
You are in the present.

719
00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:43.839
You are dealing with the present moment.

720
00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:47.130
So the present moment is the reality while the

721
00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:49.930
future doesn't exist and the past is finished.

722
00:25:50.239 --> 00:25:51.839
So where you are,

723
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:53.680
you are in the present,

724
00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:54.800
where you are

725
00:25:55.329 --> 00:25:57.760
enjoying the dynamism of the present.

726
00:25:57.969 --> 00:25:59.329
And this is what I found is that

727
00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:03.119
when first they get the realisation,

728
00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:08.640
they either go to the future or to the past according to what they have been doing.

729
00:26:08.969 --> 00:26:10.339
Now the people who are

730
00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:14.920
Who have been indulging into the left side also can be

731
00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:17.119
very much harmful to themselves

732
00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:19.920
because they also start living with their past.

733
00:26:20.209 --> 00:26:22.089
Most of them I've seen it come to me,

734
00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:22.560
mother.

735
00:26:22.849 --> 00:26:23.380
My

736
00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.050
father is not all right.

737
00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:26.680
My mother is not all right.

738
00:26:26.849 --> 00:26:28.680
My grandfather is not all right.

739
00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:30.530
My grandmother is not all right.

740
00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:33.250
The attention immediately goes to the whole.

741
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:36.780
Whole lineage to whole progeny.

742
00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:38.099
My son is like that,

743
00:26:38.229 --> 00:26:39.660
my grandson is like that.

744
00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:42.349
But if you get all right yourself,

745
00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:43.579
you are the.

746
00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:46.520
You are the centre of the whole core,

747
00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:48.260
and once you are all right,

748
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.810
you can put everyone all right.

749
00:26:49.979 --> 00:26:52.390
But what happens that suddenly the attention shifts.

750
00:26:52.489 --> 00:26:52.849
You see,

751
00:26:52.979 --> 00:26:53.930
this is the habit

752
00:26:54.099 --> 00:26:57.530
to shift the attention from yourself to others.

753
00:26:57.739 --> 00:27:00.709
Then the shifting starts about other surgeries.

754
00:27:00.819 --> 00:27:03.770
That surgery is like that and this surgery is like that.

755
00:27:03.859 --> 00:27:06.140
And that surgery we did this and that surgery

756
00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:09.099
did this like some people who are absolutely.

757
00:27:09.959 --> 00:27:11.640
Such that we cannot call them surgis,

758
00:27:11.719 --> 00:27:12.300
but they come,

759
00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:12.910
they go,

760
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.150
they are still going on.

761
00:27:14.439 --> 00:27:15.719
And then people see them and they say,

762
00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.839
if this is the surgi,

763
00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:17.959
I don't want to be a surgeon.

764
00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.219
It's like this,

765
00:27:19.229 --> 00:27:21.989
the shifting of the mind starts and people

766
00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:23.349
try

767
00:27:23.689 --> 00:27:24.569
not to be there.

768
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:27.030
But you must position yourself.

769
00:27:28.109 --> 00:27:29.229
On your spirit,

770
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:31.339
you must know that you have become the spirit.

771
00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:33.430
Position yourself is the point.

772
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:34.540
And then

773
00:27:34.829 --> 00:27:36.449
once you have grown into it,

774
00:27:36.699 --> 00:27:40.739
then you do not relate yourself in this way that my father,

775
00:27:40.949 --> 00:27:42.530
my mother is my finishes.

776
00:27:43.199 --> 00:27:44.349
Then you think,

777
00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:44.979
yes,

778
00:27:45.229 --> 00:27:48.890
my father is here who is a person who should come to Serva.

779
00:27:49.069 --> 00:27:50.140
You go up to a point,

780
00:27:50.189 --> 00:27:50.489
tell him,

781
00:27:50.589 --> 00:27:50.829
all right,

782
00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:52.219
if you can come well and good.

783
00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:52.979
If he doesn't come,

784
00:27:52.989 --> 00:27:53.560
you're not.

785
00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.890
You developed your relationship with the father.

786
00:27:57.709 --> 00:28:02.140
God Almighty and with the mother who has given you realisation.

787
00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:03.619
This is very important.

788
00:28:03.829 --> 00:28:04.540
Then secondly,

789
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:05.699
it starts like this.

790
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:06.979
Like,

791
00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:07.430
of course,

792
00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:09.660
there have been great saints in our country,

793
00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:10.579
like,

794
00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:11.180
uh,

795
00:28:11.189 --> 00:28:11.369
we,

796
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:12.180
we can say

797
00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:13.469
that we had.

798
00:28:14.449 --> 00:28:15.219
Saath,

799
00:28:15.489 --> 00:28:16.829
he was a real as soul,

800
00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:17.920
a great person,

801
00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:20.900
and his disciples would come to me and they'll say,

802
00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:21.250
all right,

803
00:28:21.329 --> 00:28:21.729
Mother,

804
00:28:21.969 --> 00:28:22.439
uh,

805
00:28:22.819 --> 00:28:24.199
you have given usization.

806
00:28:24.329 --> 00:28:25.219
Thank you very much.

807
00:28:25.469 --> 00:28:26.349
But Saar,

808
00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:26.729
you see,

809
00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:28.229
we have Saar's photograph.

810
00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:29.410
We worship Saa.

811
00:28:29.569 --> 00:28:32.979
Now this is another study is that now Christ is not here.

812
00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:35.329
So when Krishna came,

813
00:28:35.849 --> 00:28:36.560
they said,

814
00:28:36.849 --> 00:28:37.170
oh,

815
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:38.770
we will talk about the tarea,

816
00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:39.569
not about Krishna.

817
00:28:40.359 --> 00:28:41.439
When Rama came,

818
00:28:41.619 --> 00:28:42.329
they said,

819
00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.709
we'll talk about somebody who came before.

820
00:28:45.449 --> 00:28:46.969
Never when they were there.

821
00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:49.209
When Abraham came

822
00:28:49.579 --> 00:28:50.810
or Moses came,

823
00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:51.989
so they said,

824
00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:54.449
let us talk about somebody who came before.

825
00:28:54.739 --> 00:28:55.770
When that happened,

826
00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:57.150
then when Christ came,

827
00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:57.849
they said,

828
00:28:57.859 --> 00:28:59.290
let us talk about Moses.

829
00:28:59.619 --> 00:29:00.760
And now I have come,

830
00:29:00.819 --> 00:29:02.400
I have given you realisation.

831
00:29:02.579 --> 00:29:06.300
Then you would like to learn everything from Christ who is no more there.

832
00:29:08.359 --> 00:29:09.569
He's not going to tell you.

833
00:29:10.709 --> 00:29:11.829
I have to tell you.

834
00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:14.689
That doesn't mean you are disrespectful to Christ.

835
00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:16.800
Christ is as almost there as myself,

836
00:29:17.449 --> 00:29:19.119
but I have to tell you,

837
00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:20.050
not Christ.

838
00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:23.199
That is not his responsibility at this time,

839
00:29:23.319 --> 00:29:24.739
it's my responsibility.

840
00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:28.290
And so one must understand who has given you the realisation.

841
00:29:29.459 --> 00:29:33.439
And that's why Christ has said that anything against me will be forgiven,

842
00:29:33.609 --> 00:29:35.349
but nothing against the Holy Ghost,

843
00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:37.760
because the Holy Ghost will give you the realisation.

844
00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:39.410
And after taking the realisation,

845
00:29:39.449 --> 00:29:41.650
also if you try to put yourself backwards.

846
00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:43.560
Then you cannot.

847
00:29:44.359 --> 00:29:47.760
So one has to understand that who has given you the realisation.

848
00:29:49.989 --> 00:29:52.260
The same thing happens about gurus.

849
00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:53.969
This is that people are suck,

850
00:29:54.859 --> 00:29:56.729
but what have they given you the point.

851
00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:58.650
You should know what have they given you?

852
00:29:58.819 --> 00:30:00.650
Have they given you something substantial?

853
00:30:00.859 --> 00:30:01.469
They have not.

854
00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:07.209
Then why are you sticking on to that which is not going to give you what you want?

855
00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:09.569
They are not going to answer your questions.

856
00:30:09.739 --> 00:30:10.890
They are not going to

857
00:30:11.459 --> 00:30:12.770
tell you anything about it.

858
00:30:12.939 --> 00:30:15.540
So why not ask a person who can speak.

859
00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:17.569
Who can tell you,

860
00:30:17.859 --> 00:30:19.050
who can explain,

861
00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:20.579
who is in prison.

862
00:30:21.439 --> 00:30:22.530
And this is another

863
00:30:22.709 --> 00:30:26.729
human weakness that they don't want to live in the present.

864
00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:27.930
But some people will say,

865
00:30:27.939 --> 00:30:28.290
no,

866
00:30:28.579 --> 00:30:31.410
Mass is going to come after 2000 years,

867
00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:32.420
then you won't be there.

868
00:30:34.579 --> 00:30:35.609
Today I'm here,

869
00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:37.369
so better have your realisation,

870
00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:38.339
learn about it.

871
00:30:38.369 --> 00:30:39.670
When he comes afterwards,

872
00:30:39.839 --> 00:30:40.510
another one,

873
00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:41.369
then it's all right.

874
00:30:41.439 --> 00:30:43.069
But that time you are not going to be there.

875
00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:45.400
So the

876
00:30:45.699 --> 00:30:48.489
importance of presenter Jogi must understand,

877
00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:49.489
at present,

878
00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:50.810
what is the situation?

879
00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:52.089
Where am I?

880
00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:53.300
What have I done?

881
00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.939
I have to understand each and everything at present.

882
00:30:56.709 --> 00:30:56.719
This

883
00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:58.170
is an important time.

884
00:30:58.339 --> 00:30:59.599
I'm not going to lose anything.

885
00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:01.180
Time

886
00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:05.030
thinking about the past or about the future.

887
00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:05.949
At this time,

888
00:31:06.079 --> 00:31:07.270
what's my problem is

889
00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.079
and then the growth starts.

890
00:31:09.199 --> 00:31:10.239
All living things,

891
00:31:10.319 --> 00:31:11.270
whatever it is,

892
00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.689
works on present,

893
00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.550
never on the past.

894
00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:15.030
Say,

895
00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.430
as I told you yesterday,

896
00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:16.989
uh,

897
00:31:17.219 --> 00:31:17.829
root

898
00:31:18.439 --> 00:31:19.560
when it starts sprouting,

899
00:31:19.599 --> 00:31:21.109
there's a little small little

900
00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:22.229
cell.

901
00:31:22.939 --> 00:31:24.109
At the end of the road.

902
00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:25.630
It just sees

903
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.550
what is the situation at that time is all right.

904
00:31:28.599 --> 00:31:29.510
At this time,

905
00:31:29.719 --> 00:31:31.040
it is a hard.

906
00:31:32.719 --> 00:31:33.119
Soil,

907
00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:33.939
it waits.

908
00:31:35.459 --> 00:31:37.709
As soon as the soil becomes a little better,

909
00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:39.130
it starts moving.

910
00:31:39.459 --> 00:31:40.459
Then it creates a boulder.

911
00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:40.780
All right,

912
00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:41.579
the boulder is there.

913
00:31:41.699 --> 00:31:42.219
Let's go now.

914
00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:43.890
At the present,

915
00:31:43.939 --> 00:31:44.800
you have to achieve it.

916
00:31:44.859 --> 00:31:46.849
You can only achieve at the present,

917
00:31:47.099 --> 00:31:49.410
never in the future and never in the past.

918
00:31:49.619 --> 00:31:54.930
So this is another thing the Sahajoogis who are realised souls must understand that

919
00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:57.329
they have to move with the present

920
00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.010
and not with the past.

921
00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:01.229
I had to go on fighting with people,

922
00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:03.500
telling them now be in the present.

923
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:06.239
Now the knowledge of Kundalini

924
00:32:06.589 --> 00:32:09.349
was never told so clearly as it is said today.

925
00:32:10.319 --> 00:32:11.010
Now they will say,

926
00:32:11.199 --> 00:32:14.520
but people used to get realisation after so much of

927
00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:17.439
cleansing and this that was thousands of years back.

928
00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:21.939
Now we can go to the moon.

929
00:32:23.699 --> 00:32:25.569
How many people went to the moon before?

930
00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:26.699
So do we say no,

931
00:32:26.849 --> 00:32:27.739
but they used to,

932
00:32:27.859 --> 00:32:29.209
never used to go to the moon.

933
00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:30.229
So how can we?

934
00:32:32.449 --> 00:32:33.729
It's just like that.

935
00:32:33.959 --> 00:32:35.800
If something has worked out like this,

936
00:32:35.839 --> 00:32:37.910
that it's a jet kundalini now,

937
00:32:37.959 --> 00:32:38.329
and

938
00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.430
you can go to your spirit,

939
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:41.989
you can become your spirit.

940
00:32:42.119 --> 00:32:43.989
Why not take the advantage of that?

941
00:32:44.199 --> 00:32:45.560
It is because the mind

942
00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.189
is not a tuned.

943
00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:50.030
The mind has not understood

944
00:32:50.329 --> 00:32:51.839
the importance of time

945
00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:53.290
and this time.

946
00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:53.910
This

947
00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:57.489
present time is the most important time

948
00:32:57.729 --> 00:32:59.290
in the whole history of evolution,

949
00:32:59.300 --> 00:32:59.780
I can tell,

950
00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:01.410
which you will realise very soon.

951
00:33:01.689 --> 00:33:03.250
It's the most important time,

952
00:33:03.569 --> 00:33:05.119
but people don't realise it.

953
00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:06.150
And for them,

954
00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:07.439
what does it matter?

955
00:33:08.839 --> 00:33:09.030
Oh,

956
00:33:09.079 --> 00:33:09.839
we can do this.

957
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:10.670
There's nothing wrong.

958
00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:11.709
There's no danger.

959
00:33:11.969 --> 00:33:14.069
What's wrong in going into the subconscious?

960
00:33:14.319 --> 00:33:16.150
Why not get into the subconscious?

961
00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.329
Why not do this?

962
00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.290
What's wrong?

963
00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:19.670
When they suffer,

964
00:33:20.239 --> 00:33:21.079
they go down.

965
00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:24.119
They lose all their capacity

966
00:33:24.369 --> 00:33:25.479
to come back,

967
00:33:25.729 --> 00:33:26.930
then they will come to me and say,

968
00:33:26.939 --> 00:33:27.089
Mother,

969
00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:27.400
yes,

970
00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:28.939
I did this and I did that.

971
00:33:29.369 --> 00:33:32.680
Best thing is that you must understand where you should not go,

972
00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:35.359
and you must understand where you can go,

973
00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:37.359
how far you can go,

974
00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:39.010
and how much you should go.

975
00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:42.569
All this art of understanding

976
00:33:42.849 --> 00:33:44.640
is called as true knowledge.

977
00:33:45.349 --> 00:33:47.420
Of the technique of the divine.

978
00:33:48.439 --> 00:33:51.660
The technique of the divine has never been explained

979
00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:53.089
or told before.

980
00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:56.229
Nobody has ever understood

981
00:33:56.589 --> 00:34:00.770
the technique of divine before because there were not so many realises.

982
00:34:00.949 --> 00:34:02.400
It was a very

983
00:34:02.819 --> 00:34:06.219
exclusive thing which was told to one or two persons.

984
00:34:06.349 --> 00:34:08.860
But today you are fortunate to be born at this time

985
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:10.790
that this technique you can know,

986
00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:12.310
you can handle it and must.

987
00:34:13.399 --> 00:34:14.320
But even now,

988
00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:15.830
escape will be there

989
00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:16.800
in your temperament,

990
00:34:16.918 --> 00:34:18.790
so be careful on that point.

991
00:34:19.478 --> 00:34:20.070
Now the,

992
00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.418
another thing I've discovered

993
00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:22.379
that

994
00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.030
People

995
00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.149
think that

996
00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.149
if you destroy something,

997
00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:28.239
that is the past,

998
00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.030
this is another side,

999
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:30.969
then you will reach higher.

1000
00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.879
This is another idea like establishment,

1001
00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:34.580
destroy everything,

1002
00:34:34.879 --> 00:34:35.879
destroy all the traditions,

1003
00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:36.879
everything you destroy,

1004
00:34:37.399 --> 00:34:38.949
and then you will become something better.

1005
00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:39.590
It's wrong.

1006
00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:41.649
If a flower

1007
00:34:42.129 --> 00:34:42.938
becomes a fruit,

1008
00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:44.129
part of it drops out,

1009
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:44.929
not the whole.

1010
00:34:46.129 --> 00:34:47.399
Part of it becomes a fruit.

1011
00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:48.949
In the same way,

1012
00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:50.810
destruction completely

1013
00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:51.629
is

1014
00:34:51.918 --> 00:34:53.110
very indiscreet,

1015
00:34:53.478 --> 00:34:55.879
and that's how people said we are against establishment.

1016
00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:57.699
That is wrong.

1017
00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:01.629
Whatever is good of the establishment has to be taken up.

1018
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:03.979
Like traditionally,

1019
00:35:04.189 --> 00:35:07.010
marriage is respected all over the world,

1020
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.979
was respected.

1021
00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:09.030
Today it is not.

1022
00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:10.919
But I don't say

1023
00:35:11.129 --> 00:35:11.600
about it.

1024
00:35:11.689 --> 00:35:13.040
You will yourself find

1025
00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:15.989
how marriage is blissful after realisation.

1026
00:35:16.649 --> 00:35:20.389
A simple logical conclusion you should arrive at this thing.

1027
00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.280
Now supposing you have children.

1028
00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.860
And these children

1029
00:35:24.989 --> 00:35:27.989
are great souls because you realised souls,

1030
00:35:28.229 --> 00:35:32.020
so the great souls are born on this earth through you

1031
00:35:32.429 --> 00:35:34.100
because you are really

1032
00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:35.949
the people who can look after them.

1033
00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:37.570
Now these children,

1034
00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:38.639
when they are born to you,

1035
00:35:38.729 --> 00:35:40.000
they find that

1036
00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:41.889
there is no sanction of the collective.

1037
00:35:42.979 --> 00:35:43.959
You are still

1038
00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:45.649
not husband and wife.

1039
00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:47.520
The collective has not sanctioned.

1040
00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:48.500
It's a stigma.

1041
00:35:49.129 --> 00:35:51.530
You give that stigma to the child for nothing at all.

1042
00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:54.790
You have no business to give that stigma to the child.

1043
00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:57.510
Today the society is such that it accepts,

1044
00:35:57.679 --> 00:35:59.520
but the child will always have the stigma.

1045
00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.270
I've seen even with all your advancement.

1046
00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:06.070
I've seen people when they have to tell about their parents,

1047
00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:06.830
they say,

1048
00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:07.159
Mother,

1049
00:36:07.199 --> 00:36:08.270
I'm sorry to say,

1050
00:36:08.399 --> 00:36:10.159
but my parents are divorced.

1051
00:36:10.979 --> 00:36:11.270
I mean,

1052
00:36:11.389 --> 00:36:12.260
they feel

1053
00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:13.100
a little

1054
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:14.120
lower

1055
00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:17.320
than the people who do not have divorcements.

1056
00:36:17.469 --> 00:36:18.139
They feel

1057
00:36:18.389 --> 00:36:19.949
that the parents have let them down.

1058
00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:21.820
They feel that

1059
00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:24.979
there's some sort of a stigma,

1060
00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:26.610
a kind of

1061
00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:28.889
identity in their character

1062
00:36:29.179 --> 00:36:32.340
that their parents have not been able to give them

1063
00:36:32.659 --> 00:36:34.459
that respectability.

1064
00:36:36.489 --> 00:36:38.419
So the respectability to the child

1065
00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.260
can be only given.

1066
00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:42.199
By the parents

1067
00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:45.090
who are real realizers because they respect

1068
00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:47.989
themselves and they know how to respect all

1069
00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.110
that is

1070
00:36:49.399 --> 00:36:50.310
beautiful

1071
00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:51.320
and good.

1072
00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:52.479
After realisation,

1073
00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:55.030
people marry 99% people

1074
00:36:55.679 --> 00:36:58.330
if they marry with proper idea of vibrations

1075
00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.679
become absolutely beautifully married permanent.

1076
00:37:02.929 --> 00:37:04.370
There's no question of quarrel,

1077
00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:05.649
no question of divorce,

1078
00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:06.850
no question of anything.

1079
00:37:07.409 --> 00:37:09.560
The whole thing becomes such a beautiful thing.

1080
00:37:10.399 --> 00:37:11.300
There is no

1081
00:37:12.429 --> 00:37:13.010
Problem

1082
00:37:13.729 --> 00:37:14.379
At all

1083
00:37:14.689 --> 00:37:15.719
from them to me.

1084
00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:16.409
On the contrary,

1085
00:37:16.489 --> 00:37:18.870
I find beautiful children appearing on the scene,

1086
00:37:19.449 --> 00:37:23.919
and I really enjoy that beauty of such special type of children

1087
00:37:24.169 --> 00:37:25.360
that come on this earth,

1088
00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:27.439
and they also respect their parents.

1089
00:37:27.649 --> 00:37:29.679
What's the use of fighting before the children?

1090
00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:31.409
You don't give them the fighting spirit,

1091
00:37:31.489 --> 00:37:31.969
do you?

1092
00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:33.209
Have you to send them on the water?

1093
00:37:33.489 --> 00:37:35.129
No wonder all these.

1094
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:38.120
So-called developed countries are busy

1095
00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:39.679
creating wars after wars.

1096
00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.199
They headache to the rest of the country.

1097
00:37:41.239 --> 00:37:41.469
You see,

1098
00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.709
there is a war going on.

1099
00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.840
There's always a fear that this country is going to invade that country,

1100
00:37:45.879 --> 00:37:47.629
that country is going to invade this country.

1101
00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.310
It's a big nonsense going on.

1102
00:37:49.479 --> 00:37:50.639
It starts from the family.

1103
00:37:51.199 --> 00:37:52.840
Where the husband wife from morning till

1104
00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:55.270
evening just fighting before the children,

1105
00:37:55.399 --> 00:37:56.429
quarrelling with them,

1106
00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:58.979
ultimately ending up in a divorce case.

1107
00:37:59.189 --> 00:38:01.629
It's a shameful thing to be divorced normally,

1108
00:38:01.879 --> 00:38:02.879
but it happens.

1109
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.669
You accept it because society is accepted today the society is accepted,

1110
00:38:06.959 --> 00:38:09.120
but the child will not be accepted by the society,

1111
00:38:09.159 --> 00:38:09.879
whatever you may do.

1112
00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.469
When the child will say that I have no parents,

1113
00:38:13.719 --> 00:38:15.689
I don't know who my parents are,

1114
00:38:15.919 --> 00:38:17.510
or my parents are divorced.

1115
00:38:17.679 --> 00:38:18.129
Naturally,

1116
00:38:18.199 --> 00:38:20.629
the child who is coming from a family,

1117
00:38:20.719 --> 00:38:21.689
which is not disturbed,

1118
00:38:21.719 --> 00:38:24.080
will definitely stand higher than that.

1119
00:38:25.439 --> 00:38:28.260
You yourself must have seen that in your family

1120
00:38:28.469 --> 00:38:31.610
when the parents were fighting how you felt sad about

1121
00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:34.139
because you are the product of both of them,

1122
00:38:34.389 --> 00:38:36.179
and parents have no business

1123
00:38:36.469 --> 00:38:41.020
to give that kind of a personality of deficiency to the children.

1124
00:38:41.239 --> 00:38:43.870
Here the people are so ego oriented that they

1125
00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:46.689
don't think of anyone for them I matters.

1126
00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:47.419
I,

1127
00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:49.270
I hate her and

1128
00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:50.540
he hates him.

1129
00:38:50.629 --> 00:38:51.659
It goes on like this,

1130
00:38:51.669 --> 00:38:53.459
the hatred is such a

1131
00:38:54.719 --> 00:38:55.629
Accepted

1132
00:38:55.909 --> 00:38:56.750
phenomena

1133
00:38:57.429 --> 00:38:59.219
that the child suffers.

1134
00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:05.219
Either he becomes an extremely exaggerated volcanic violent person.

1135
00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:07.300
Like I heard this time

1136
00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:09.620
this morning I went to the television

1137
00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:13.780
and there was a little boy of 14 years has killed another boy of 10 years.

1138
00:39:13.899 --> 00:39:14.139
I mean,

1139
00:39:14.229 --> 00:39:16.090
we cannot think of this in a

1140
00:39:16.629 --> 00:39:20.250
poor country like India because we are fighting with our power to there,

1141
00:39:20.429 --> 00:39:21.909
but here when they have become rich,

1142
00:39:21.949 --> 00:39:22.989
they start killing each other.

1143
00:39:25.489 --> 00:39:27.209
This kind of violent nature

1144
00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:30.010
you develop when you come from disturbed families.

1145
00:39:30.169 --> 00:39:32.479
Now the establishment of a family is important,

1146
00:39:32.729 --> 00:39:34.879
but the way it was established is not correct.

1147
00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:36.360
Now after Sergioga,

1148
00:39:36.449 --> 00:39:38.120
the establishment is perfect,

1149
00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:39.600
perfect

1150
00:39:39.889 --> 00:39:40.600
harmony.

1151
00:39:40.889 --> 00:39:44.120
Today only a couple has left for England who had come here,

1152
00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.620
and this gentleman was not willing to marry the lady,

1153
00:39:46.659 --> 00:39:48.469
and the lady was not willing to marry,

1154
00:39:48.649 --> 00:39:49.919
but they were living together.

1155
00:39:50.169 --> 00:39:52.649
And then somehow or other the lady thought she can marry.

1156
00:39:52.989 --> 00:39:54.290
And then the gentleman would not.

1157
00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:54.610
So I said,

1158
00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:55.729
you don't see him for a few,

1159
00:39:55.939 --> 00:39:56.149
few,

1160
00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:56.929
few days.

1161
00:39:57.139 --> 00:39:58.350
And the gentleman I agreed.

1162
00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:02.550
Now the gentleman thanks me every time for that,

1163
00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:03.260
that mother.

1164
00:40:03.429 --> 00:40:04.969
This is such a blessing.

1165
00:40:05.179 --> 00:40:06.020
And when they came here,

1166
00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:06.399
they said,

1167
00:40:06.409 --> 00:40:08.090
we went on holidays so many times.

1168
00:40:08.219 --> 00:40:09.260
We went to all kinds.

1169
00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.110
Beaches

1170
00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.639
where of course she burned her

1171
00:40:12.199 --> 00:40:13.590
skin and all this nonsense.

1172
00:40:13.639 --> 00:40:13.909
You see,

1173
00:40:13.949 --> 00:40:17.560
it's such all destroying stuff that you have as she developed white

1174
00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:20.850
patches here and white patches there and actually she came for that.

1175
00:40:21.159 --> 00:40:23.489
After doing all that so called fun,

1176
00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.469
they came to Sergio got mad.

1177
00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:27.709
And after marriage,

1178
00:40:28.919 --> 00:40:29.909
What happened

1179
00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:33.659
that now a new type of a dimension of joy

1180
00:40:33.959 --> 00:40:35.229
is pouring in them.

1181
00:40:35.639 --> 00:40:36.750
There's such happy.

1182
00:40:37.639 --> 00:40:41.209
And now they want to have children because first they didn't want to have children.

1183
00:40:41.379 --> 00:40:42.489
Now they're old enough,

1184
00:40:42.699 --> 00:40:46.189
so I said you better take a child as just a

1185
00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:49.570
sort of adoption from somewhere.

1186
00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:53.729
So now the surgeon is love there so children so much

1187
00:40:53.899 --> 00:40:55.770
that we'll give them for adoption also.

1188
00:40:55.899 --> 00:41:00.129
It's a big problem to get a child for them to adopt who is a real life soul.

1189
00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:02.020
Now all these things have happened.

1190
00:41:02.659 --> 00:41:04.010
In everybody's life,

1191
00:41:04.139 --> 00:41:06.979
the mother has been quarrelling or the father has been quarrelling.

1192
00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:09.350
There has been a problem on and this and that.

1193
00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:10.770
And with that,

1194
00:41:11.139 --> 00:41:12.050
the outcome

1195
00:41:12.179 --> 00:41:14.850
is a person who is also a seeker.

1196
00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:15.939
So imagine

1197
00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:18.250
standing on a crocodile's back,

1198
00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:18.929
you see,

1199
00:41:19.139 --> 00:41:21.090
you are seeking your spirit,

1200
00:41:21.419 --> 00:41:23.669
and the crocodile is not going to leave you.

1201
00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:24.909
So be careful

1202
00:41:25.139 --> 00:41:26.989
that you have to jump into the.

1203
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.979
This boat

1204
00:41:32.649 --> 00:41:35.469
Of yoga leaving all that nonsense.

1205
00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.820
You have to start your life afresh.

1206
00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.159
Change your ideas.

1207
00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:42.649
Don't have all those frights like people are frightened of women,

1208
00:41:42.699 --> 00:41:44.020
women are frightened of men.

1209
00:41:44.159 --> 00:41:45.439
This is something nonsense.

1210
00:41:45.919 --> 00:41:48.709
You have to shed out all these fears about each other

1211
00:41:48.879 --> 00:41:52.909
and then tie up yourself into complete love and romance.

1212
00:41:53.199 --> 00:41:53.709
Actually,

1213
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000
now we are also,

1214
00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:58.750
we have done in the West so much research on love and romance,

1215
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.360
but I don't find anybody romance.

1216
00:42:01.199 --> 00:42:03.870
What I find is all the time they are talking ill of each other

1217
00:42:04.159 --> 00:42:06.159
trying to remove everybody's images.

1218
00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:08.080
Only thing they are worried about how to

1219
00:42:09.959 --> 00:42:11.750
increase the size of their purses.

1220
00:42:11.959 --> 00:42:12.750
That's all.

1221
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:13.959
There is nothing,

1222
00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:14.570
no love.

1223
00:42:14.679 --> 00:42:16.229
It's something so surprising.

1224
00:42:16.439 --> 00:42:16.610
Why

1225
00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:18.520
we are in India,

1226
00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:20.229
we can find our societies.

1227
00:42:20.479 --> 00:42:20.699
I mean,

1228
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:24.229
we have really the real romance whether we are old or young doesn't matter.

1229
00:42:24.439 --> 00:42:26.110
For us it is decided once for all.

1230
00:42:26.199 --> 00:42:27.310
Now this is your husband,

1231
00:42:27.479 --> 00:42:28.199
this is your wife.

1232
00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:32.120
And we enjoy and all this experimentation leads to where

1233
00:42:32.729 --> 00:42:35.219
10 people who are married are in the orphanage.

1234
00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:36.040
10

1235
00:42:36.449 --> 00:42:37.649
women are in the orphanage,

1236
00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:39.120
10 men are in the orphanage,

1237
00:42:39.129 --> 00:42:40.929
and the 10 children are also in the orphanage.

1238
00:42:41.169 --> 00:42:42.959
All end up in an orphanage in old age.

1239
00:42:42.969 --> 00:42:46.120
They don't know what to do and then they don't know who to talk to,

1240
00:42:46.129 --> 00:42:51.520
so they talk to their fridges or to their ovens because they don't know who to talk to.

1241
00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:52.290
They are so lonely.

1242
00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:55.110
This is the outcome

1243
00:42:55.239 --> 00:42:56.600
of the so-called

1244
00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.469
research work done on the romance

1245
00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:01.800
and also of love.

1246
00:43:02.939 --> 00:43:06.790
We are all part and parcel of 11 great being.

1247
00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:09.189
We are not here to fight each other.

1248
00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:10.429
That is malignancy.

1249
00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:15.479
That is malignancy when one cell becomes more powerful and tries to overpower

1250
00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:16.860
another person,

1251
00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:18.500
then it is malignant.

1252
00:43:18.989 --> 00:43:22.629
The enjoyment comes when you understand the coordination between the two,

1253
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:24.330
like two wheels of a chariot.

1254
00:43:24.429 --> 00:43:24.919
One is left,

1255
00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:25.780
one is right.

1256
00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:27.949
They are stationed in their own places.

1257
00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:30.739
Support the chariot and enjoy the right.

1258
00:43:30.949 --> 00:43:32.899
This is what one has to understand.

1259
00:43:32.989 --> 00:43:35.090
But gradually after realisation,

1260
00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:37.149
you'll understand how blissful it is.

1261
00:43:37.659 --> 00:43:39.239
To be sensibly married,

1262
00:43:39.449 --> 00:43:42.320
to have children who are great saints,

1263
00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:44.560
and some of the children that are born these days

1264
00:43:44.729 --> 00:43:47.439
are really so saintly and so beautiful

1265
00:43:47.729 --> 00:43:48.159
that

1266
00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:50.300
after a child is born

1267
00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:53.239
to a real life so then I don't bother about their marriages.

1268
00:43:53.290 --> 00:43:55.429
It comes around all right because they know how to put them.

1269
00:43:56.489 --> 00:43:57.889
It's so sweet and so beautiful.

1270
00:43:58.729 --> 00:43:59.370
So that's how

1271
00:43:59.689 --> 00:44:00.449
we have to

1272
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:02.580
gradually start seeing it,

1273
00:44:02.729 --> 00:44:05.760
because our ideas are that establishment is all bad,

1274
00:44:05.969 --> 00:44:06.919
family is bad.

1275
00:44:07.129 --> 00:44:07.889
Leave your parents,

1276
00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:08.879
get out of them.

1277
00:44:08.969 --> 00:44:10.729
They're the worst people ever born.

1278
00:44:12.229 --> 00:44:13.830
You suddenly start feeling

1279
00:44:13.979 --> 00:44:15.810
the goodness of your parents.

1280
00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:17.459
You start seeing them better.

1281
00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:18.500
They see you better.

1282
00:44:18.699 --> 00:44:19.810
They see you happier.

1283
00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:21.449
They see you so differently.

1284
00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:22.370
They are asking,

1285
00:44:22.739 --> 00:44:24.409
how is it to change my child?

1286
00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:25.360
What has happened?

1287
00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:26.290
They come to surgery.

1288
00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:28.399
The whole family comes to surg.

1289
00:44:28.979 --> 00:44:32.810
All these things go on happening in life in a human being,

1290
00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:34.780
but he doesn't want to change.

1291
00:44:35.679 --> 00:44:37.189
Something is definitely wrong

1292
00:44:37.439 --> 00:44:38.870
and it's a very simple thing.

1293
00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:40.570
We have forgotten how to laugh.

1294
00:44:41.979 --> 00:44:44.010
Pure love is not there.

1295
00:44:44.179 --> 00:44:45.169
If it is so,

1296
00:44:45.659 --> 00:44:47.399
everything works out so beautifully.

1297
00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:50.489
You really enjoy the company of all the survis.

1298
00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:52.580
Now if I tell them now you go on a holiday,

1299
00:44:52.689 --> 00:44:52.929
I said,

1300
00:44:52.979 --> 00:44:53.100
Mother,

1301
00:44:53.179 --> 00:44:54.169
this is our holiday.

1302
00:44:54.379 --> 00:44:55.379
They're enjoying it.

1303
00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:58.100
They are in the state of great enjoyment.

1304
00:44:58.179 --> 00:44:59.280
You ask anyone there,

1305
00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:00.959
they don't want to do anything else.

1306
00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:02.489
They don't want to go anywhere else.

1307
00:45:02.810 --> 00:45:02.979
I mean,

1308
00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:04.610
even if I say you go now,

1309
00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:05.770
this it's all right.

1310
00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:06.600
Finished now,

1311
00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:07.229
you go away.

1312
00:45:07.419 --> 00:45:09.100
They feel so sad that they are leaving.

1313
00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:11.239
Others are,

1314
00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:13.260
you feel so close and so

1315
00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:14.399
near to others.

1316
00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:15.669
Those people now.

1317
00:45:16.679 --> 00:45:19.449
Doctor Warren is a very well known doctor

1318
00:45:19.449 --> 00:45:22.280
from Australia and there are other people like him

1319
00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:23.510
who come to India.

1320
00:45:23.719 --> 00:45:24.199
In India,

1321
00:45:24.239 --> 00:45:26.050
people are very humble.

1322
00:45:26.439 --> 00:45:27.750
They live in the villages.

1323
00:45:27.879 --> 00:45:28.790
They live in the,

1324
00:45:29.439 --> 00:45:29.810
uh,

1325
00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:31.629
small little huts.

1326
00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:34.189
They beat each other equally

1327
00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:35.479
with such joy.

1328
00:45:36.379 --> 00:45:38.209
They never have that feeling of

1329
00:45:38.649 --> 00:45:39.800
class consciousness.

1330
00:45:39.969 --> 00:45:41.040
All this is lost.

1331
00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:42.520
All the joy

1332
00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:45.909
of just meeting another soul who is a realised soul,

1333
00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:47.840
feeling the spirit of that person,

1334
00:45:47.929 --> 00:45:49.580
the fragrance of that person

1335
00:45:49.889 --> 00:45:50.770
makes you happy.

1336
00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:55.179
So now you must know you are on a journey of the new world.

1337
00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:56.459
It's a new dimension.

1338
00:45:56.669 --> 00:45:58.429
So give up all that was nonsensical,

1339
00:45:58.550 --> 00:46:00.989
and gradually we know that this is nonsensical,

1340
00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:04.060
because if you ask the questions after realisation,

1341
00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:05.860
you can feel the vibrations.

1342
00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:08.229
That's why there's a difference between one and another.

1343
00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:11.760
I find that one has no vibrations and another has vibrations,

1344
00:46:11.949 --> 00:46:13.909
and you will go on saying that this should not be done,

1345
00:46:13.989 --> 00:46:14.790
but another will say no,

1346
00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:15.429
this should be done.

1347
00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:19.590
But the one who has the vibrations must be always listened to,

1348
00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:23.169
and that's how the things work out better and better and better.

1349
00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:27.639
And this quarrelling ends up and you become very loving people to each other.

1350
00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:30.639
This has to happen unless and until this happens.

1351
00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:31.760
If husband and wife,

1352
00:46:31.879 --> 00:46:34.070
two persons can't live together happily,

1353
00:46:34.239 --> 00:46:35.639
how do you expect the whole world to

1354
00:46:35.639 --> 00:46:38.830
live together happily by forming these United Nations,

1355
00:46:38.959 --> 00:46:41.370
by forming all these artificial things?

1356
00:46:41.399 --> 00:46:42.669
Do you think they'll live together?

1357
00:46:42.879 --> 00:46:43.629
They cannot.

1358
00:46:43.879 --> 00:46:46.879
Basically what has happened is they think they are individuals.

1359
00:46:46.899 --> 00:46:47.550
They are not.

1360
00:46:47.879 --> 00:46:50.270
They are part and parcel of the whole like

1361
00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:53.379
one cell in the body is connected with another cell

1362
00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:56.340
in the same way you are all connected with each other,

1363
00:46:56.469 --> 00:46:59.060
and that you can find out after realisation.

1364
00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:00.500
Once you find out,

1365
00:47:00.590 --> 00:47:02.939
you feel so secured and so happy.

1366
00:47:03.149 --> 00:47:05.580
You have brothers and sisters all over the world.

1367
00:47:05.830 --> 00:47:06.820
Wherever you get,

1368
00:47:06.949 --> 00:47:08.459
they will know that you are here.

1369
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:11.110
There was a girl who went to Sicily once.

1370
00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:12.399
She,

1371
00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:13.870
she's a Swiss girl,

1372
00:47:14.239 --> 00:47:14.669
Ruth,

1373
00:47:14.739 --> 00:47:15.199
and

1374
00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:17.360
she just went there and she was sitting alone.

1375
00:47:17.439 --> 00:47:17.860
She thought,

1376
00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:19.149
what a place Sicily is.

1377
00:47:19.159 --> 00:47:23.040
There's not even a single jo here and I'm just sitting alone.

1378
00:47:23.159 --> 00:47:25.239
These people are all playing monkey tricks,

1379
00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.830
and she was just a little bit feeling lonely

1380
00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:29.520
and suddenly she felt vibrations,

1381
00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:30.590
so she turned around.

1382
00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:32.070
There was another girl sitting.

1383
00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:32.870
She said,

1384
00:47:33.689 --> 00:47:34.510
Are you

1385
00:47:34.719 --> 00:47:35.669
mother's child?

1386
00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:36.110
She said,

1387
00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:36.580
Yes,

1388
00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:37.310
are you?

1389
00:47:37.439 --> 00:47:39.239
And then they grasped each other and

1390
00:47:39.919 --> 00:47:40.790
they were so happy,

1391
00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:41.149
you know,

1392
00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.120
and the tears started flowing through their eyes,

1393
00:47:43.149 --> 00:47:45.350
and people couldn't understand what had happened to the

1394
00:47:45.350 --> 00:47:48.469
two unknown persons suddenly get into such jubilation.

1395
00:47:48.639 --> 00:47:51.810
Her name was Gilmant and she was a French girl and they said it was.

1396
00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:56.840
A pleasure to meet her there just by vibration she felt the oneness and they enjoyed.

1397
00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:59.239
Then they said the life was so great there in

1398
00:47:59.239 --> 00:48:02.040
Sicily and they established a centre in Sicily after that,

1399
00:48:02.199 --> 00:48:03.159
both of them put together.

1400
00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:03.889
Can you imagine?

1401
00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:06.439
So all these things happen and then you

1402
00:48:06.439 --> 00:48:09.270
understand that you are living with another language,

1403
00:48:09.449 --> 00:48:10.239
with another.

1404
00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:10.620
Uh,

1405
00:48:11.199 --> 00:48:13.840
life which is so beautiful and bubbling with

1406
00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:15.840
joy every moment and you start seeing the

1407
00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:18.760
joy everywhere and you just enjoying yourself and

1408
00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:20.639
also you enjoy the mistakes you have committed.

1409
00:48:20.719 --> 00:48:21.929
You laugh at you and you said,

1410
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:22.439
Oh God,

1411
00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:23.389
I was like that.

1412
00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:24.199
That was me.

1413
00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:25.419
That's finished now gone.

1414
00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:26.649
So it was like this

1415
00:48:26.959 --> 00:48:30.770
and you just make fun of yourself and you really and,

1416
00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:32.429
and really see that oh,

1417
00:48:32.479 --> 00:48:32.979
that was me,

1418
00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:33.520
that was Mr.

1419
00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:34.320
ego of mine.

1420
00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:35.800
Oh what how to do bye bye.

1421
00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:37.949
It's a very interesting vote

1422
00:48:38.699 --> 00:48:42.020
when I see them like that and when I see them enjoying each other.

1423
00:48:42.899 --> 00:48:44.449
That's the greatest joy for me.

1424
00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:46.010
There's nothing else I want.

1425
00:48:46.139 --> 00:48:49.350
I want that you should feel that joy and that love among yourself.

1426
00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:51.370
There should be no quarrelling.

1427
00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:52.729
There should be no fighting.

1428
00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:54.780
There should be oneness of understanding.

1429
00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:56.840
And move under one person.

1430
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:58.060
There's nothing to fight.

1431
00:48:58.229 --> 00:49:00.070
Like I cannot contact every one of you,

1432
00:49:00.149 --> 00:49:01.620
so there's one person appointed.

1433
00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:03.649
Like here we have Steve and Christie,

1434
00:49:03.949 --> 00:49:05.219
both of them working out

1435
00:49:05.469 --> 00:49:05.909
in Boston.

1436
00:49:05.949 --> 00:49:07.560
You'll find them extremely good people.

1437
00:49:07.629 --> 00:49:09.080
They're extremely nice people.

1438
00:49:09.189 --> 00:49:10.659
They have done a very good job,

1439
00:49:10.909 --> 00:49:12.909
but maybe some person might be a quarrel,

1440
00:49:12.949 --> 00:49:14.820
some person fighting person may fight them.

1441
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.580
It doesn't matter,

1442
00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:16.189
but

1443
00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:18.959
I find they are hopeless,

1444
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:21.310
they'll be there and when I find that they'll go away.

1445
00:49:21.389 --> 00:49:23.379
So you should not worry challenging

1446
00:49:23.629 --> 00:49:25.070
their personality,

1447
00:49:25.149 --> 00:49:26.409
challenging their leadership.

1448
00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:31.739
It will help a lot because all of us have to be together

1449
00:49:31.949 --> 00:49:33.659
in complete love with each other.

1450
00:49:33.909 --> 00:49:37.270
Nobody wants to dominate anyone because we have to gain nothing.

1451
00:49:37.689 --> 00:49:38.770
You have to gain nothing.

1452
00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:39.270
It's

1453
00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:41.139
a system where you give.

1454
00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:43.010
This is the only system where you give,

1455
00:49:43.219 --> 00:49:47.010
but we have never experienced before the power of love,

1456
00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:47.989
the power.

1457
00:49:49.209 --> 00:49:49.219
Of

1458
00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:51.510
this purity.

1459
00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:53.500
This innocence.

1460
00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:56.280
We have only used hatred.

1461
00:49:57.010 --> 00:49:58.560
That has been our power,

1462
00:49:58.610 --> 00:49:59.719
so give up that

1463
00:49:59.969 --> 00:50:01.139
and use this power.

1464
00:50:01.209 --> 00:50:02.439
It's so simple.

1465
00:50:02.689 --> 00:50:03.919
It works beautifully.

1466
00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:06.199
Only you have to learn how to use it,

1467
00:50:06.409 --> 00:50:07.760
and it works

1468
00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:09.699
sometimes with great strength,

1469
00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:11.199
sometimes delicately,

1470
00:50:11.649 --> 00:50:11.929
sometimes.

1471
00:50:12.304 --> 00:50:12.895
Seriously,

1472
00:50:13.254 --> 00:50:15.314
sometimes giving you lessons is very sweet.

1473
00:50:15.495 --> 00:50:18.014
So you have to learn all these literary things

1474
00:50:18.014 --> 00:50:20.695
and you'll enjoy how this mind is a monkey,

1475
00:50:20.774 --> 00:50:21.604
how it works,

1476
00:50:21.695 --> 00:50:23.284
and how you watch the monkey there.

1477
00:50:23.495 --> 00:50:25.885
And it's beautiful to see yourself like that,

1478
00:50:25.975 --> 00:50:27.534
the drama of yourself.

1479
00:50:28.629 --> 00:50:29.899
May God bless you all.

1480
00:50:30.129 --> 00:50:33.820
I'm very happy to be here in Boston and you know I'm going away,

1481
00:50:34.149 --> 00:50:36.139
and we have a little programme tomorrow

1482
00:50:36.389 --> 00:50:38.179
for which we have to sort out people.

1483
00:50:38.350 --> 00:50:39.939
I don't know how they are going to do it,

1484
00:50:40.310 --> 00:50:40.830
uh.

1485
00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:43.669
And I don't know whatever they want to do,

1486
00:50:43.709 --> 00:50:44.229
they can do it,

1487
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:47.340
but we'll have again the session of realisation first.

1488
00:50:47.629 --> 00:50:48.800
And after that,

1489
00:50:49.179 --> 00:50:49.870
uh,

1490
00:50:50.719 --> 00:50:51.590
We can see

1491
00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:55.429
how it works out for tomorrow's programme is rather,

1492
00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:56.310
uh,

1493
00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:57.020
something

1494
00:50:57.199 --> 00:51:00.030
which we don't expose people to normally because,

1495
00:51:00.350 --> 00:51:00.830
uh,

1496
00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:02.060
people are not yet ready.

1497
00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:04.429
I should say to accept the truth is very difficult.

1498
00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:06.919
So we don't expose people to that.

1499
00:51:07.949 --> 00:51:10.699
But considering that I'm here today

1500
00:51:11.350 --> 00:51:12.310
and tomorrow,

1501
00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:14.239
and I may not come next year,

1502
00:51:14.429 --> 00:51:15.060
I don't know.

1503
00:51:15.939 --> 00:51:17.610
They think that we should

1504
00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:19.719
allow people to come down

1505
00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:21.679
and get the experience deeper,

1506
00:51:22.090 --> 00:51:23.820
and we should expose them to surgery,

1507
00:51:24.449 --> 00:51:26.600
but sometimes we lose some people with that.

1508
00:51:26.889 --> 00:51:27.689
It's not

1509
00:51:27.969 --> 00:51:28.610
risky.

1510
00:51:28.989 --> 00:51:29.729
I know that,

1511
00:51:29.969 --> 00:51:32.030
but I don't know they will sort it out.

1512
00:51:32.129 --> 00:51:33.199
I don't know what to say

1513
00:51:33.489 --> 00:51:36.409
because this is a higher blasting,

1514
00:51:36.449 --> 00:51:37.679
as you can call it,

1515
00:51:38.010 --> 00:51:40.830
where you get your realisation much deeper

1516
00:51:41.129 --> 00:51:43.409
and you understand yourself much deeper.

1517
00:51:43.899 --> 00:51:45.669
And also you get

1518
00:51:46.090 --> 00:51:48.280
nicely rooted into your spirit,

1519
00:51:48.689 --> 00:51:51.050
but that we don't allow people to go

1520
00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:53.729
through till they have established themselves properly.

1521
00:51:55.810 --> 00:51:56.510
And

1522
00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:58.860
that's the thing we are thinking about.

1523
00:51:59.070 --> 00:52:01.060
We are in two minds what to do.

1524
00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:06.659
Now it is for you to decide to come to a ceremony like that tomorrow we are having

1525
00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:07.830
because these days,

1526
00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:08.659
9 days,

1527
00:52:08.830 --> 00:52:11.100
are very important days where

1528
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:12.899
the goddess is

1529
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:14.189
worshipped.

1530
00:52:14.699 --> 00:52:17.350
And tomorrow is a very important day again,

1531
00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:21.090
so we have to have the ceremony and the Indians know what it is now.

1532
00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:23.989
Tomorrow is a very important day,

1533
00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:27.070
and that day all over the world that is going on.

1534
00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:28.439
All the surgeries are doing,

1535
00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:29.510
so we have to do it

1536
00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:33.429
and those who would like to come are welcome to come for that.

1537
00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:36.320
And also you are invited for a lunch there.

1538
00:52:38.810 --> 00:52:39.379
Now,

1539
00:52:39.409 --> 00:52:39.580
today,

1540
00:52:39.729 --> 00:52:42.560
let's again have the experience of realisation.

1541
00:52:42.850 --> 00:52:44.449
Those who have come for the first time,

1542
00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:45.889
please raise your hands.

1543
00:52:48.209 --> 00:52:48.219
Yeah

1544
00:52:50.379 --> 00:52:50.770
But

1545
00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:53.850
It's quite a

1546
00:52:57.590 --> 00:52:57.600
Hm

1547
00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:03.600
Why don't we let them come to the front and let some of the people who had it.

1548
00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:07.350
Sit behind and then afterwards they can work on them.

1549
00:53:09.139 --> 00:53:09.159
All right,

1550
00:53:09.239 --> 00:53:10.110
what we can do,

1551
00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:10.399
you see,

1552
00:53:10.439 --> 00:53:13.870
just to adjust this because those who have come here for the first time.

1553
00:53:14.909 --> 00:53:16.399
are to be given realisation,

1554
00:53:16.449 --> 00:53:17.439
that's important.

1555
00:53:17.649 --> 00:53:19.340
Others mostly have got it.

1556
00:53:19.810 --> 00:53:23.239
Those who have felt the cool breeze before yesterday

1557
00:53:23.409 --> 00:53:24.010
yesterday and day before,

1558
00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:24.929
please raise your hands.

1559
00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:25.370
Let's see.

1560
00:53:29.889 --> 00:53:30.510
That's enough.

1561
00:53:32.419 --> 00:53:32.439
All right.

1562
00:53:33.330 --> 00:53:37.649
Now what I would suggest that those who have felt like that should go at the back,

1563
00:53:37.689 --> 00:53:40.479
and those who have not felt should come forward because those

1564
00:53:40.479 --> 00:53:43.239
who have felt will know how to work it out themselves.

1565
00:53:43.370 --> 00:53:46.780
So we can have them at the backside and we'll tell them how to do it.

1566
00:53:47.810 --> 00:53:48.709
You must know

1567
00:53:49.330 --> 00:53:49.800
that

1568
00:53:50.330 --> 00:53:51.850
you do not know anything about it.

1569
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:55.580
This is not a dark room in which you have to enter.

1570
00:53:56.110 --> 00:53:57.909
It's a thing that has to be logical.

1571
00:53:57.989 --> 00:53:59.510
You must have all the knowledge about it.

1572
00:53:59.550 --> 00:54:00.669
You must know what it is,

1573
00:54:00.709 --> 00:54:01.639
what is the Pundalini,

1574
00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:02.790
what are the chakras,

1575
00:54:02.830 --> 00:54:03.709
how to put it right,

1576
00:54:03.830 --> 00:54:05.540
how to give realisation to others,

1577
00:54:05.639 --> 00:54:06.020
and

1578
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:07.229
how to manoeuvre it.

1579
00:54:08.479 --> 00:54:10.729
And anybody who has given you initiation.

1580
00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:13.770
If he has not given you realisation,

1581
00:54:13.939 --> 00:54:14.959
then better forget them.

1582
00:54:15.139 --> 00:54:15.969
That's very important.

1583
00:54:17.679 --> 00:54:17.689
That

1584
00:54:18.310 --> 00:54:19.500
there are so many in the market.

1585
00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:21.179
One better than that.

1586
00:54:22.090 --> 00:54:24.320
So I have to just tell you that those

1587
00:54:24.850 --> 00:54:26.530
who have not given you realisation.

1588
00:54:27.929 --> 00:54:29.250
If they are still in your head,

1589
00:54:29.330 --> 00:54:31.239
better get rid of them for the time being,

1590
00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:32.770
till you get your realisation,

1591
00:54:32.969 --> 00:54:34.050
because if you go on like this,

1592
00:54:34.169 --> 00:54:34.969
there's no end to it.

1593
00:54:35.939 --> 00:54:36.270
You see,

1594
00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:37.550
people here have gurus,

1595
00:54:37.570 --> 00:54:38.840
just like as they have locks.

1596
00:54:38.850 --> 00:54:39.320
You see,

1597
00:54:39.489 --> 00:54:40.169
they go in the market,

1598
00:54:40.209 --> 00:54:41.090
this lock is not good,

1599
00:54:41.129 --> 00:54:41.590
so that's.

1600
00:54:42.489 --> 00:54:42.610
See,

1601
00:54:42.689 --> 00:54:45.500
it is the one who gives you realisation is your guru.

1602
00:54:45.729 --> 00:54:46.129
Otherwise,

1603
00:54:46.209 --> 00:54:48.290
who has not given you a realisation is not a guru.

1604
00:54:48.899 --> 00:54:49.899
So forget them.

1605
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.250
There are many in the market.

1606
00:54:51.419 --> 00:54:52.260
The lady asked me,

1607
00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:53.840
I would say forget all of them.

1608
00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:55.510
She hasn't got realisation,

1609
00:54:55.979 --> 00:54:56.459
finished.

1610
00:54:57.469 --> 00:55:00.320
You be selfish in the sense you must know

1611
00:55:00.570 --> 00:55:02.080
what you have got yourself.

1612
00:55:02.330 --> 00:55:03.409
That's the important point.

1613
00:55:03.489 --> 00:55:04.800
If you haven't got anything,

1614
00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:06.320
then it's useless.

1615
00:55:06.489 --> 00:55:06.689
I mean,

1616
00:55:06.729 --> 00:55:07.570
you go to a shop,

1617
00:55:07.649 --> 00:55:08.129
pay the money,

1618
00:55:08.169 --> 00:55:09.600
and walk out without anything,

1619
00:55:09.729 --> 00:55:11.120
or at the most with the disease.

1620
00:55:12.209 --> 00:55:13.439
Is it what you are seeking?

1621
00:55:16.719 --> 00:55:17.699
Just as logical

1622
00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:20.770
So if you

1623
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.060
have been to someone like that,

1624
00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:22.840
just forget it.

1625
00:55:22.919 --> 00:55:24.669
I'll try to neutralise it.

1626
00:55:24.879 --> 00:55:25.649
I'll try again,

1627
00:55:25.719 --> 00:55:26.120
I say,

1628
00:55:26.129 --> 00:55:27.389
because there's no guarantee,

1629
00:55:27.719 --> 00:55:29.800
but I'm sure it will work out.

1630
00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:30.989
Don't have any

1631
00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:32.560
doubts about yourself,

1632
00:55:32.639 --> 00:55:33.290
that's all.

1633
00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:34.919
You can have doubts about all of them,

1634
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.080
but not about yourself.

1635
00:55:38.790 --> 00:55:39.219
White House

1636
00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:44.020
Just slip your shoes off,

1637
00:55:44.389 --> 00:55:45.639
because that helps you to be.

1638
00:55:45.949 --> 00:55:46.979
Just slip off your shoes,

1639
00:55:46.989 --> 00:55:47.540
please.

1640
00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:49.780
And loosen any belts that are there,

1641
00:55:50.209 --> 00:55:50.870
collar and tie,

1642
00:55:50.909 --> 00:55:51.469
just loosen them.

1643
00:55:52.530 --> 00:55:54.129
Not to be not to have very,

1644
00:55:54.179 --> 00:55:57.010
very tight clothes in here or here.

1645
00:55:57.110 --> 00:55:57.929
These are chakras,

1646
00:55:57.969 --> 00:55:58.199
you see,

1647
00:55:58.409 --> 00:56:00.010
so make yourself a little loose.

1648
00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:11.409
Now,

1649
00:56:11.669 --> 00:56:13.379
you have to put your both hands

1650
00:56:13.590 --> 00:56:14.389
just like this.

1651
00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:16.199
On your lap,

1652
00:56:16.659 --> 00:56:17.300
very comfortable.

1653
00:56:17.459 --> 00:56:18.500
You have to sit comfortably.

1654
00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:19.020
First of all,

1655
00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:19.969
be comfortable.

1656
00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:22.209
There should be no crowding up,

1657
00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:23.330
there should be no,

1658
00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:24.570
uh,

1659
00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:26.689
problem as far as

1660
00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:30.780
the bodily comfort is concerned because your attention will be diverted.

1661
00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:32.189
As I said,

1662
00:56:32.199 --> 00:56:34.030
at this moment you are with me.

1663
00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:35.479
Forget the past.

1664
00:56:36.570 --> 00:56:39.300
Whatever you have done or whatever has been there,

1665
00:56:39.689 --> 00:56:40.250
forget it,

1666
00:56:40.610 --> 00:56:41.000
forget it,

1667
00:56:41.290 --> 00:56:41.840
forget it.

1668
00:56:42.050 --> 00:56:43.560
You are not to feel guilty at all.

1669
00:56:43.729 --> 00:56:44.639
At this moment,

1670
00:56:44.689 --> 00:56:46.080
you are in the present.

1671
00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:48.739
So please don't worry what you have done wrong,

1672
00:56:48.889 --> 00:56:50.090
what has gone wrong,

1673
00:56:50.209 --> 00:56:50.969
nothing of the kind.

1674
00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:51.969
You are seekers.

1675
00:56:52.879 --> 00:56:54.610
You have come to seek the truth,

1676
00:56:54.939 --> 00:56:56.050
to be the spirit,

1677
00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:58.139
and it doesn't matter what you have done.

1678
00:56:58.260 --> 00:56:59.300
Everything is forgotten,

1679
00:56:59.419 --> 00:57:00.090
forgiven.

1680
00:57:00.379 --> 00:57:04.729
So you also forget and always say that I'm not guilty at all.

1681
00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:06.429
Don't live in the past.

1682
00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:07.899
Whatever has happened has happened.

1683
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:09.409
Now,

1684
00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:13.540
both the feet should be on the mother earth because she helps us to suck

1685
00:57:13.939 --> 00:57:14.850
our problems.

1686
00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:15.500
So just

1687
00:57:16.850 --> 00:57:16.860
And

1688
00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:20.350
the left hand is the hand of your desire.

1689
00:57:20.879 --> 00:57:22.709
Now it should act spontaneously.

1690
00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:23.669
It does act,

1691
00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:24.909
but as you know,

1692
00:57:24.919 --> 00:57:26.679
there are problems on the chakras.

1693
00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:28.350
I have to work it out myself,

1694
00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:32.229
and you have to help me that way that you work it out yourself.

1695
00:57:32.479 --> 00:57:36.179
So I will tell you how to put your right hand on different centres

1696
00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:37.790
to nourish that centre,

1697
00:57:37.879 --> 00:57:39.080
which is a little bit weak.

1698
00:57:41.929 --> 00:57:43.699
And you have to close your eyes.

1699
00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:45.060
Please don't open your eyes.

1700
00:57:45.179 --> 00:57:46.340
Even if you have spectacles,

1701
00:57:46.379 --> 00:57:47.050
you can take it out.

1702
00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:49.719
It will be better because it also helps the eyesight.

1703
00:57:49.979 --> 00:57:52.300
You are not to open the eyes till I tell you,

1704
00:57:52.310 --> 00:57:52.939
and it's

1705
00:57:53.179 --> 00:57:54.050
quite some time

1706
00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:55.659
that you will not open your eyes,

1707
00:57:55.699 --> 00:57:57.570
so keep your eyes shut.

1708
00:57:57.979 --> 00:57:59.260
Don't open your eyes.

1709
00:58:00.830 --> 00:58:02.330
Keep your neck straight,

1710
00:58:02.679 --> 00:58:04.219
not too much bending

1711
00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:05.629
forward or backward.

1712
00:58:06.270 --> 00:58:06.280
Just

1713
00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:08.139
keep your neck straight.

1714
00:58:10.899 --> 00:58:11.459
If possible,

1715
00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:15.409
don't have any hats on your head because this has to be opened up.

1716
00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:16.790
If you can take out your hats,

1717
00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:17.810
it will be a good idea.

1718
00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:19.770
So this portion is left open.

1719
00:58:19.979 --> 00:58:21.060
This has to open up.

1720
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:24.629
All right.

1721
00:58:25.010 --> 00:58:26.919
Now keep your eyes shut.

1722
00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:34.389
Put your right hand on the heart.

1723
00:58:35.550 --> 00:58:37.510
On your heart on the left hand side.

1724
00:58:37.879 --> 00:58:39.909
Only your right hand has to be moved.

1725
00:58:40.439 --> 00:58:42.229
Left hand has to be straight

1726
00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:43.590
with your fingers.

1727
00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:46.270
Stretched

1728
00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:51.840
Here

1729
00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:53.560
you have to say.

1730
00:58:54.889 --> 00:58:56.979
Or ask a question to me

1731
00:58:57.439 --> 00:58:59.229
calling me mother if it is easier.

1732
00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:00.060
Mother,

1733
00:59:01.229 --> 00:59:02.429
am I the spirit?

1734
00:59:04.350 --> 00:59:05.189
Ask the question.

1735
00:59:05.989 --> 00:59:06.340
Mother,

1736
00:59:09.669 --> 00:59:09.709
amma the spirit.

1737
00:59:09.719 --> 00:59:11.949
They should take the malas with Mala.

1738
00:59:14.290 --> 00:59:15.320
Dance and to take a

1739
00:59:29.379 --> 00:59:32.149
If you are wearing any malas or anything from any guru,

1740
00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:36.050
please take them out also because they stop the Kundalini awakening.

1741
00:59:36.449 --> 00:59:37.070
So please take it out.

1742
00:59:38.189 --> 00:59:40.889
It's better to be kind to ourselves and fair to ourselves

1743
00:59:41.229 --> 00:59:43.419
because we are here to achieve

1744
00:59:43.830 --> 00:59:44.699
the spirit

1745
00:59:45.149 --> 00:59:46.300
and not to be

1746
00:59:46.590 --> 00:59:48.500
belonging to anyone like that.

1747
00:59:49.209 --> 00:59:51.919
We have to be ourselves to begin with,

1748
00:59:52.199 --> 00:59:52.629
and

1749
00:59:52.909 --> 00:59:54.429
then only we belong

1750
00:59:54.750 --> 00:59:55.919
to the kingdom of God.

1751
00:59:57.550 --> 00:59:57.780
Now,

1752
00:59:57.790 --> 00:59:58.229
just say,

1753
00:59:58.310 --> 00:59:58.530
mother,

1754
00:59:58.979 --> 00:59:59.790
am I despair.

1755
01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:01.929
I

1756
01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:04.580
Ask rice

1757
01:00:08.389 --> 01:00:09.310
Mother M.

1758
01:00:15.439 --> 01:00:16.840
Now put this right hand.

1759
01:00:19.149 --> 01:00:19.699
Down

1760
01:00:19.909 --> 01:00:20.790
on the stomach.

1761
01:00:21.629 --> 01:00:22.939
On the left hand side

1762
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:24.139
and press it.

1763
01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:27.120
This is the centre of the primordial master,

1764
01:00:27.429 --> 01:00:29.300
and as the spirit is your master.

1765
01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:33.929
You are your own master.

1766
01:00:35.530 --> 01:00:37.010
So you have to say,

1767
01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:37.810
Mother,

1768
01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:39.570
I am my own master.

1769
01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:41.139
You have to say that 10 times.

1770
01:01:03.129 --> 01:01:03.139
Hm.

1771
01:01:07.699 --> 01:01:08.260
Shooting

1772
01:01:09.699 --> 01:01:11.100
After saying that,

1773
01:01:11.459 --> 01:01:13.610
you put this hand a little lower

1774
01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:16.199
at the lower side of your stomach,

1775
01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:17.179
on the left hand side.

1776
01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:19.030
We are working on the left hand side only.

1777
01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:20.050
Now,

1778
01:01:20.379 --> 01:01:21.379
at this point.

1779
01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:23.439
You have to say

1780
01:01:24.350 --> 01:01:24.909
Mother,

1781
01:01:25.189 --> 01:01:29.790
teach me the divine technique or make me the divine technique.

1782
01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:31.389
Mother,

1783
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:33.590
make me the divine technique.

1784
01:01:36.850 --> 01:01:37.520
6 days.

1785
01:01:41.070 --> 01:01:41.090
No

1786
01:01:46.909 --> 01:01:46.919
Mhm.

1787
01:01:49.459 --> 01:01:49.469
Um

1788
01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:52.050
Good.

1789
01:01:55.189 --> 01:01:58.300
Now you again put your hand on your heart.

1790
01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:02.379
Now with full assertion,

1791
01:02:02.739 --> 01:02:03.610
without

1792
01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:04.889
any guilt,

1793
01:02:05.219 --> 01:02:06.250
without any guilt.

1794
01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:09.929
You have to say 1012 times,

1795
01:02:10.659 --> 01:02:10.949
Mother,

1796
01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:14.139
I am the spirit because you are the spirit.

1797
01:02:14.219 --> 01:02:15.260
You are the spirit,

1798
01:02:15.379 --> 01:02:16.290
you are the spirit.

1799
01:02:16.379 --> 01:02:17.209
So you have to say,

1800
01:02:17.419 --> 01:02:17.659
Mother,

1801
01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:18.979
I am the Spirit.

1802
01:02:26.290 --> 01:02:27.629
I am a spirit.

1803
01:02:27.959 --> 01:02:28.290
Mother,

1804
01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:29.870
I am a spirit.

1805
01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:30.489
Mother,

1806
01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:31.050
I am.

1807
01:02:32.350 --> 01:02:32.689
Mother,

1808
01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:33.250
I am

1809
01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:34.370
I

1810
01:02:37.570 --> 01:02:37.590
should be.

1811
01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:38.540
Mother,

1812
01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:38.570
I am,

1813
01:02:41.899 --> 01:02:41.919
I am.

1814
01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:43.620
Mother,

1815
01:02:43.679 --> 01:02:44.120
I am.

1816
01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:49.159
I am the spirit.

1817
01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:49.800
Now,

1818
01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:51.600
you put your right hand.

1819
01:02:52.989 --> 01:02:53.729
Raise it

1820
01:02:54.139 --> 01:02:55.969
on the base of your neck,

1821
01:02:56.739 --> 01:02:58.939
on the shoulder and pull it out a little bit.

1822
01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:01.219
At this point,

1823
01:03:03.209 --> 01:03:04.399
You have to say

1824
01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:07.439
16 times,

1825
01:03:07.590 --> 01:03:07.830
Mother,

1826
01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:08.939
I am not guilty.

1827
01:03:14.370 --> 01:03:14.419
And

1828
01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:16.620
I

1829
01:03:18.070 --> 01:03:18.709
Mother and

1830
01:03:20.389 --> 01:03:20.780
Mother

1831
01:03:22.679 --> 01:03:22.709
I

1832
01:03:24.729 --> 01:03:25.159
Mother

1833
01:03:26.379 --> 01:03:27.060
it's gone.

1834
01:03:28.310 --> 01:03:28.800
It's

1835
01:03:29.459 --> 01:03:29.699
OK.

1836
01:03:35.409 --> 01:03:35.449
Mo

1837
01:03:37.590 --> 01:03:38.120
I

1838
01:03:39.350 --> 01:03:39.739
Strong

1839
01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:41.310
Hm.

1840
01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:46.320
Uh

1841
01:03:47.909 --> 01:03:48.929
Oh that's

1842
01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:50.639
Now raise

1843
01:03:51.199 --> 01:03:52.350
this right hand

1844
01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:54.469
on your forehead

1845
01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:55.590
across.

1846
01:03:56.899 --> 01:03:57.699
At this point,

1847
01:03:57.770 --> 01:03:58.669
you have to say,

1848
01:03:58.929 --> 01:03:59.209
Mother,

1849
01:03:59.330 --> 01:04:00.879
I forgive everyone.

1850
01:04:03.199 --> 01:04:03.610
Say it

1851
01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:05.350
twice,

1852
01:04:05.679 --> 01:04:07.310
but with full confidence.

1853
01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:09.810
We.

1854
01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:11.530
My mother,

1855
01:04:11.570 --> 01:04:11.889
I don't.

1856
01:04:13.929 --> 01:04:14.189
Mother,

1857
01:04:14.209 --> 01:04:14.520
I

1858
01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:20.439
Now put the right hand again back onto the back of the head,

1859
01:04:21.050 --> 01:04:22.360
back of the head

1860
01:04:22.649 --> 01:04:24.000
where the optic lobe is

1861
01:04:24.290 --> 01:04:25.219
and push it,

1862
01:04:25.530 --> 01:04:26.189
put your

1863
01:04:27.110 --> 01:04:30.179
Push your head backwards and hold it tight

1864
01:04:30.909 --> 01:04:31.989
and say now here.

1865
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:37.979
Without feeling guilty again 100 times I say without feeling guilty you have to say.

1866
01:04:39.370 --> 01:04:41.159
If I have done any mistakes,

1867
01:04:41.370 --> 01:04:41.889
O Lord,

1868
01:04:42.050 --> 01:04:42.979
please forgive me,

1869
01:04:43.209 --> 01:04:43.989
said thrice,

1870
01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:45.409
without feeling guilty.

1871
01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:54.629
I.

1872
01:04:58.070 --> 01:04:58.500
Now

1873
01:04:58.669 --> 01:05:00.540
put this hand on top of your head.

1874
01:05:02.090 --> 01:05:05.060
And press it with your palm in the centre of your head

1875
01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:07.699
and try to move it clockwise,

1876
01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:09.219
but at this point,

1877
01:05:09.469 --> 01:05:10.300
I cannot

1878
01:05:10.590 --> 01:05:12.780
take your freedom into my hands.

1879
01:05:12.989 --> 01:05:14.620
You have to have your freedom,

1880
01:05:14.830 --> 01:05:16.860
whether you want your realisation or not.

1881
01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:18.060
So you have to say,

1882
01:05:18.270 --> 01:05:18.830
Mother,

1883
01:05:19.709 --> 01:05:21.350
give me my realisation.

1884
01:05:21.429 --> 01:05:22.590
I cannot force upon you.

1885
01:05:22.629 --> 01:05:23.820
So you have to ask for it.

1886
01:05:24.030 --> 01:05:24.550
So just say,

1887
01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:24.790
Mother,

1888
01:05:24.830 --> 01:05:26.870
please give me my realisation.

1889
01:05:27.189 --> 01:05:28.959
Say it 7 times and move the

1890
01:05:29.189 --> 01:05:29.659
head.

1891
01:05:30.459 --> 01:05:32.290
In a clockwise manner while saying that.

1892
01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:34.169
Please

1893
01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:36.570
No

1894
01:05:39.709 --> 01:05:40.129
Please give

1895
01:05:42.179 --> 01:05:42.419
Mother,

1896
01:05:42.570 --> 01:05:43.090
please give me

1897
01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:46.280
Please give me my

1898
01:05:47.629 --> 01:05:47.889
Mother,

1899
01:05:48.030 --> 01:05:48.129
please.

1900
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:53.300
Mother

1901
01:05:54.439 --> 01:05:55.909
Now put the right hand

1902
01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:58.439
without opening your eyes on your lap.

1903
01:06:03.149 --> 01:06:03.800
Now

1904
01:06:04.310 --> 01:06:06.790
put your left hand up on your head,

1905
01:06:07.229 --> 01:06:08.429
little about 5

1906
01:06:08.709 --> 01:06:11.860
inches and see if there's a cool breeze coming in.

1907
01:06:13.830 --> 01:06:14.659
Little higher,

1908
01:06:15.070 --> 01:06:15.929
little higher

1909
01:06:16.429 --> 01:06:17.439
because at the

1910
01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:19.370
Little higher,

1911
01:06:19.699 --> 01:06:21.050
about 5 inches,

1912
01:06:21.419 --> 01:06:22.969
not too high or too low,

1913
01:06:23.179 --> 01:06:23.969
but see yourself,

1914
01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:27.139
you can move your hand and see if there's a cool breeze coming in.

1915
01:06:29.459 --> 01:06:30.399
And in your hand,

1916
01:06:30.479 --> 01:06:31.840
also there's a full bridge coming in.

1917
01:06:37.729 --> 01:06:37.739
Hm

1918
01:06:41.070 --> 01:06:43.389
Now change your hands and see for yourself.

1919
01:06:43.469 --> 01:06:46.830
Put the left hand on the lap towards me and see with your right hand.

1920
01:07:28.530 --> 01:07:29.689
Go on to the air.

1921
01:07:30.610 --> 01:07:31.290
I see.

1922
01:07:46.889 --> 01:07:47.010
Mhm.

1923
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:49.280
Hm

1924
01:07:53.379 --> 01:07:55.649
Now put both hands towards me.

1925
01:07:58.159 --> 01:07:59.169
And now

1926
01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:00.330
open your eyes,

1927
01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:01.739
put them on your lap.

1928
01:08:03.709 --> 01:08:05.459
Open your eyes slowly.

1929
01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:08.379
Very slowly

1930
01:08:14.389 --> 01:08:15.949
Now watch me without thinking.

1931
01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:21.470
Now I'll teach you how to raise your kundalini.

1932
01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:23.629
You may be put on your spectacles

1933
01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:24.720
if you want to.

1934
01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:30.209
Put the left hand in front of you like this,

1935
01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:31.450
just like this,

1936
01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:35.020
left hand in front of the kundalin like this while sitting down.

1937
01:08:35.859 --> 01:08:37.990
And now try to move your hand

1938
01:08:38.319 --> 01:08:39.379
from the Kundalini

1939
01:08:39.669 --> 01:08:40.350
upward,

1940
01:08:40.709 --> 01:08:41.149
forward,

1941
01:08:41.270 --> 01:08:41.979
backward

1942
01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:44.220
in a clockwise manner.

1943
01:08:44.509 --> 01:08:45.109
Let's stop.

1944
01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:53.339
Now,

1945
01:08:53.379 --> 01:08:54.779
put it on top of your head

1946
01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:56.609
and loosen your

1947
01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:58.970
shoulders and twist it

1948
01:08:59.490 --> 01:09:00.189
round

1949
01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:01.689
and give it a knot,

1950
01:09:01.859 --> 01:09:02.620
a big knot.

1951
01:09:04.309 --> 01:09:05.389
you have to do 3 times.

1952
01:09:05.508 --> 01:09:06.309
Let's do it again.

1953
01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:11.939
All of you should do.

1954
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:12.589
Then later on,

1955
01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:13.689
you'll say I didn't get it.

1956
01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:17.089
Loosen your arms.

1957
01:09:19.339 --> 01:09:19.479
it

1958
01:09:21.649 --> 01:09:24.129
Put back your head and give it a nod.

1959
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:27.750
Do it again once more.

1960
01:09:29.529 --> 01:09:31.450
Now this time you have to give 3 notes.

1961
01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:39.000
One

1962
01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:45.950
3

1963
01:09:47.509 --> 01:09:48.020
Now see,

1964
01:09:48.029 --> 01:09:48.560
in your hands,

1965
01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:49.830
are you feeling the pulvis?

1966
01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:55.270
See on your heads.

1967
01:09:56.799 --> 01:09:57.620
Why didn't you do

1968
01:10:00.569 --> 01:10:02.330
She has an elbow injury.

1969
01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:02.669
Oh,

1970
01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:04.310
really?

1971
01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:04.859
All right.

1972
01:10:05.649 --> 01:10:06.080
It's all right.

1973
01:10:06.129 --> 01:10:06.799
You put your hands,

1974
01:10:06.839 --> 01:10:07.359
you'll be all right.

1975
01:10:07.479 --> 01:10:08.479
Put your legs all right.

1976
01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:16.680
See,

1977
01:10:16.759 --> 01:10:18.189
is that cool breeze coming

1978
01:10:18.919 --> 01:10:19.589
from your head?

1979
01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:22.850
Put all your hands up like that.

1980
01:10:23.689 --> 01:10:25.189
And I ask a question,

1981
01:10:25.399 --> 01:10:27.189
is this the bree of the Holy Ghost,

1982
01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:27.520
Mother?

1983
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:30.649
This is the breeze of the Holy Ghost.

1984
01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:33.729
This is the breeze of the Holy Ghost,

1985
01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:34.129
Mother?

1986
01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:36.709
Is this the breeze of the Holy Ghost,

1987
01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:37.089
Mother?

1988
01:10:39.330 --> 01:10:40.500
You start feeling it in the house.

1989
01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:48.319
Hm

1990
01:10:49.299 --> 01:10:49.899
tremendous.

1991
01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:51.740
Now,

1992
01:10:51.859 --> 01:10:52.660
see for yourself.

1993
01:11:00.970 --> 01:11:01.479
All right.

1994
01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:03.680
There's no thought

1995
01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:04.649
in the mind.

1996
01:11:05.799 --> 01:11:06.490
They still talk

1997
01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:08.500
Enjoy your meditation.

1998
01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:09.339
Just close your eyes.

1999
01:11:09.379 --> 01:11:10.020
Don't think.

2000
01:11:12.149 --> 01:11:14.259
Now those who got realisation yesterday

2001
01:11:14.589 --> 01:11:15.390
should get up

2002
01:11:15.709 --> 01:11:17.790
and see over the heads of other people,

2003
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:19.790
and Doctor Warren will tell you how to do it.

2004
01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:20.899
There's Steve here,

2005
01:11:21.069 --> 01:11:22.549
they'll all see you how to do it.

2006
01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:23.109
Come along,

2007
01:11:23.149 --> 01:11:24.540
I'll put your elbow right.

2008
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:25.410
Come here,

2009
01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.419
this girl.

2010
01:11:28.509 --> 01:11:28.790
Jesse,

2011
01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:29.709
don't open your eyes,

2012
01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:30.859
keep them shut.

2013
01:11:31.149 --> 01:11:32.009
They will see your,

2014
01:11:32.189 --> 01:11:34.339
if there's a vibrations coming from you or not.

2015
01:11:34.589 --> 01:11:35.259
All those

2016
01:11:35.629 --> 01:11:38.140
who got the realisation before should join them.

2017
01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:40.540
We see

2018
01:11:40.729 --> 01:11:41.439
what happened

2019
01:11:41.850 --> 01:11:42.830
to your elbow?
