00:03.050 --> 00:11.030
[Voice off]: Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, the
most important spiritual figure in the world

00:11.030 --> 00:12.080
today.

00:12.080 --> 00:37.120
Please join us on a special program of “Audrey
Hope’s real women”

00:37.120 --> 00:45.800
Interviewer: My name is Audrey Hopes and welcome
to ‘Real women”.

00:45.800 --> 00:51.270
It is a great honour to be in the presence
of the most important spiritual figure in

00:51.270 --> 00:54.829
the world today, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:54.829 --> 01:00.890
Shri Mataji is a world leader and has travelled
the globe many times over to give Self Realization

01:00.890 --> 01:02.789
to thousands.

01:02.789 --> 01:08.440
Self Realization is the pure connexion with
our spiritual nature and is the only hope

01:08.440 --> 01:11.190
for a stable society.

01:11.190 --> 01:15.370
Today is that day prophesized by the saints.

01:15.370 --> 01:19.160
Once you may have needed to travel to the
Himalayas or to meditate on a mountain for

01:19.160 --> 01:24.630
twenty years, but now, through the grace of
Shri Mataji, there is a simple way to achieve

01:24.630 --> 01:28.280
that connexion and that is through Sahaja
Yoga.

01:28.280 --> 01:34.510
Shri Mataji founded Sahaja Yoga as a method
for human beings to experience the truth within

01:34.510 --> 01:36.090
and to become your own master.

01:36.090 --> 01:41.640
Shri Mataji is a mother and a grandmother,
a true role model for all human beings.

01:41.640 --> 01:45.710
Shri Mataji was a spiritual guide for Mahatma
Gandhi.

01:45.710 --> 01:52.570
She accepts no money for Realization and she
says the truth cannot be paid for.

01:52.570 --> 01:57.880
She joins us after her fourth visit to the
United Nations and before her journey to Washington

01:57.880 --> 01:58.900
DC.

01:58.900 --> 02:01.860
Shri Mataji is known all over the world.

02:01.860 --> 02:03.960
She is less known in the United States.

02:03.960 --> 02:09.990
Well, it is here, in the mist of media and
its power, where she is needed the most.

02:09.990 --> 02:13.170
Shri Mataji, we are deeply honoured to have
you here, thank you.

02:13.170 --> 02:15.110
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much.

02:15.110 --> 02:21.420
Interviewer: I’d like to begin by speaking
about Self Realization and to tell the viewers

02:21.420 --> 02:23.530
what Self Realization is.

02:23.530 --> 02:33.560
Shri Mataji: Within yourself lies a power
which is called in Sanskrit language as Kundalini,

02:33.560 --> 02:36.000
which is in the sacrum bone.

02:36.000 --> 02:44.569
That means definitely, that the Greeks knew
this was a sacred bone where that power was

02:44.569 --> 02:45.569
lying.

02:45.569 --> 02:51.860
This is the power which connects you to the
All-pervading Power.

02:51.860 --> 02:59.860
Now the truth is that we are not this body,
this mind, this ego, these conditionings.

02:59.860 --> 03:08.230
But you are the pure Spirit because you say:
“My ego, my body”, you are the pure Spirit,

03:08.230 --> 03:10.220
this is one truth about yourself.

03:10.220 --> 03:16.090
Another truth is that there is the All-pervading
Power of divine love.

03:16.090 --> 03:18.850
It’s called by various names.

03:18.850 --> 03:22.819
You see these beautiful flowers; it’s a
miracle itself.

03:22.819 --> 03:24.680
And who runs our heart?

03:24.680 --> 03:29.880
We never inquire, we don’t find by doctors
will tell you it’s the autonomous nervous

03:29.880 --> 03:30.880
system.

03:30.880 --> 03:31.890
But who is this “auto”?

03:31.890 --> 03:40.650
So these two things we have to realize that
we are the pure Spirit and there is an All-pervading

03:40.650 --> 03:43.130
Power of divine love.

03:43.130 --> 03:45.960
Power of love, not of hatred.

03:45.960 --> 03:48.690
Interviewer: How does one receive Self Realization?

03:48.690 --> 03:55.190
Does a person have to give up their personal
life or self problems before they can attain

03:55.190 --> 03:56.190
this?

03:56.190 --> 04:00.870
Shri Mataji: It’s very simple, that within
our being, a complete machinery is already

04:00.870 --> 04:03.530
made through our evolutionary process.

04:03.530 --> 04:13.100
And we have seven centres, main seven centres
placed on our central nervous system, or we

04:13.100 --> 04:23.330
can call it on the parasympathetic and ultimately,
this power raises, penetrates through these

04:23.330 --> 04:32.449
six centres only, ultimately, pierces through
the fontanel bone area and connects you to

04:32.449 --> 04:34.749
that All-pervading Power.

04:34.749 --> 04:42.580
While it is travelling through these charkas
or the centres or the energy centres we can

04:42.580 --> 04:45.830
call them, it nourishes them.

04:45.830 --> 04:51.960
Not only it nourishes, it integrates them
and it enlightens them.

04:51.960 --> 04:56.539
Most of the problems, global problems, are
because of human beings.

04:56.539 --> 05:00.789
And most of the human problems are because
of these centres.

05:00.789 --> 05:07.370
Because these centres cater to our physical,
mental, emotional and spiritual needs.

05:07.370 --> 05:14.949
So once these centres are out of gear, we
have all these problems whether on an individual

05:14.949 --> 05:17.499
basis or on a collective basis.

05:17.499 --> 05:28.900
So when this connects to the All-pervading
Power, then you achieve a new state of awareness.

05:28.900 --> 05:31.780
So there’s a breakthrough in your evolution.

05:31.780 --> 05:33.949
Evolution process is spontaneous.

05:33.949 --> 05:38.139
We have not paid for it, we didn’t do anything,
we are becoming human beings.

05:38.139 --> 05:41.449
So now, the last one, why should we pay for
it?

05:41.449 --> 05:43.759
Or why should we do anything about it?

05:43.759 --> 05:49.660
Interviewer: Does one need blind faith or
can this be approached as you say, or how

05:49.660 --> 05:51.180
is it approached like a science?

05:51.180 --> 05:53.210
Shri Mataji: It’s just a living process.

05:53.210 --> 05:58.960
You try to understand this way, that this
Mother earth is there.

05:58.960 --> 06:03.009
What we have to do is to put one seed in it
and the seed sprouts.

06:03.009 --> 06:04.009
How?

06:04.009 --> 06:09.430
Because it is built in, in the seed to sprout
and built in, in the Mother Earth to make

06:09.430 --> 06:10.430
it sprout.

06:10.430 --> 06:12.400
It’s as simple as that.

06:12.400 --> 06:16.349
Interviewer: We Americans are very into scientific
proof.

06:16.349 --> 06:21.379
[Laughter]
And you describe Sahaja Yoga as an essence

06:21.379 --> 06:26.160
of all religions and not just a religion.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.439
How is Sahaja Yoga different?

06:27.439 --> 06:29.090
Shri Mataji: “Saha” means “with”.

06:29.090 --> 06:31.110
“Ja” means born.

06:31.110 --> 06:37.460
Born with you is the right to have this union,
the Yoga.

06:37.460 --> 06:40.069
That is Sahaja Yoga.

06:40.069 --> 06:50.839
By this union, you realize that all the religions
were flowers born on one tree of spirituality.

06:50.839 --> 06:55.349
But we have plucked the flowers and now we
are fighting with the dead flowers.

06:55.349 --> 07:05.349
If there is one God then why could we-how
could we fight in the name of God?

07:05.349 --> 07:07.610
This is the philosophy of Gandhiji also.

07:07.610 --> 07:16.800
We also followed the same philosophy not only
but, as we worship all the incarnations and

07:16.800 --> 07:22.479
all the prophets and all messiahs, in the
same way, he said we have to worship them.

07:22.479 --> 07:27.569
It’s not just to show respect but you must
worship the same way.

07:27.569 --> 07:36.229
That is Sahaj religion which encompasses all
the religions and also respects because in

07:36.229 --> 07:38.690
essence all of them are the same.

07:38.690 --> 07:45.180
And if there is one singular message in all
these religions is that: “Seek your Self

07:45.180 --> 07:46.860
to be born again”.

07:46.860 --> 07:49.559
That’s the message in all the religions.

07:49.559 --> 07:56.149
Interviewer: So where has the religion gone
wrong?

07:56.149 --> 08:01.479
We are- let’s take Christianity for example.

08:01.479 --> 08:09.679
Shri Mataji: Christianity has gone wrong at
a very early stage I should say, where it

08:09.679 --> 08:13.129
was taken over by Paul.

08:13.129 --> 08:18.740
I asked my father when I first saw his name
in the Bible, I said: “Who is this Mister

08:18.740 --> 08:19.740
Paul?”

08:19.740 --> 08:21.689
He said: “He is a squatter.

08:21.689 --> 08:23.740
He had nothing to do with Christ.

08:23.740 --> 08:26.149
He never met Christ.

08:26.149 --> 08:31.059
He had actually killed so many Christians,
he has killed the disciple of Christ called

08:31.059 --> 08:32.059
Steven.

08:32.059 --> 08:39.589
But being a bureaucrat, he thought it was
a good platform to jump onto the platform

08:39.589 --> 08:41.180
of Christianity.

08:41.180 --> 08:44.529
And he had to have help from somebody, one
of the disciples.

08:44.529 --> 08:50.569
The worse disciple of Christ was Peter, so
he grabbed Peter and has written the Bible”.

08:50.569 --> 08:58.540
Despite all the things they have done, that
Christ told Peter that “Satan will catch

08:58.540 --> 09:02.750
hold of you’ it’s clearly said.

09:02.750 --> 09:08.529
Now this Mister Peter and Mister Paul put
together tried to spoil all the great work

09:08.529 --> 09:16.600
of our Lord Jesus-Christ because, first of
all, the worst for women.

09:16.600 --> 09:20.330
Paul hated women from his heart.

09:20.330 --> 09:24.980
And that’s why even for Christ’s Mother,
he uses a word like “woman”.

09:24.980 --> 09:26.779
To us, she is a Goddess.

09:26.779 --> 09:29.250
She is a Mahalakshmi, to Sahaja Yogis.

09:29.250 --> 09:31.540
But to him, she was just a woman.

09:31.540 --> 09:39.190
And the way he has conducted the whole thing
has brought such a disaster on the women of

09:39.190 --> 09:42.080
the West.

09:42.080 --> 09:48.800
Even now, up till now, women are treated as
something very low for spirituality.

09:48.800 --> 09:53.420
But in India, a woman is the shakti, is the
power.

09:53.420 --> 09:59.540
Another great mistake they have committed
is in describing the Trinity.

09:59.540 --> 10:11.010
We have God the father, God the son and the
third one is a Holy Ghost, is a dove.

10:11.010 --> 10:16.129
How can you have a father and a son and no
mother?

10:16.129 --> 10:24.180
But there is a Primordial Mother which was
accepted by all the religions even the Jews

10:24.180 --> 10:26.340
had it.

10:26.340 --> 10:28.680
Greeks called it Athena.

10:28.680 --> 10:31.600
“Atha” in Sanskrit means “primordial”.

10:31.600 --> 10:32.600
Athena.

10:32.600 --> 10:33.880
In India, this is called as Adi Shakti.

10:33.880 --> 10:41.130
In every religion, they had this Mother who
was the Primordial Mother.

10:41.130 --> 10:50.490
So he cancelled all the powers of a mother
and that is how the women have a very inferiority

10:50.490 --> 10:54.410
complex, I think, or insecurity in the Western
world.

10:54.410 --> 11:02.519
Because they think we have to, all the time,
be apologetical [unsure] and we should always

11:02.519 --> 11:08.209
serve the men and we should sell our body,
we should make ourselves very attractive,

11:08.209 --> 11:10.510
otherwise, we have no place!

11:10.510 --> 11:14.569
And that is how the morality of women is shattered.

11:14.569 --> 11:18.230
Interviewer: I wanted to use a quote from
that [pensée?

11:18.230 --> 11:21.940
French word?] in “Timothy 1” to really
emphasise this point.

11:21.940 --> 11:25.370
It says in the Bible, “A woman should learn
in quietness and full submission.

11:25.370 --> 11:31.540
I do not present a woman to teach or to have
authority over a man; she must be silent.

11:31.540 --> 11:33.640
For Adam was formed first, then Eve.

11:33.640 --> 11:37.769
And Adam was not the one deceived; it was
the woman who was deceived and became a sinner.

11:37.769 --> 11:38.769
[The New Testament, 1 Timothy 2:9-14]

11:38.769 --> 11:41.940
Shri Mataji: That’s also a mistake about
Adam and Eve also.

11:41.940 --> 11:43.709
But that, I’ll deal later on.

11:43.709 --> 11:51.269
But a simple thing is that it was a complete
attack on womanhood.

11:51.269 --> 11:56.689
And that’s how women have accepted- imagine
such a developed country like England, was

11:56.689 --> 12:00.800
discussing till yesterday, whether a woman
should preach or not.

12:00.800 --> 12:01.800
Yes!

12:01.800 --> 12:07.170
I mean, now, with great difficulty, some people
have agreed that women should preach.

12:07.170 --> 12:08.480
I just don’t understand.

12:08.480 --> 12:11.410
In India, a woman is very powerful.

12:11.410 --> 12:15.050
She doesn’t care for her husband if he goes
after another woman.

12:15.050 --> 12:18.190
She says: “Alright, he’s sinful, let him
go to Hell.

12:18.190 --> 12:19.190
I don’t care."

12:19.190 --> 12:23.380
She stands on her own merit on her chastity.

12:23.380 --> 12:25.250
She doesn’t bother.

12:25.250 --> 12:33.410
Now, the whole situation is so bad, that women
have to be, all the time, trying to, you see,

12:33.410 --> 12:35.870
expose their body also.

12:35.870 --> 12:40.069
I haven’t seen a single film in which a
man is exposed.

12:40.069 --> 12:46.329
It’s always the women [who] must be exposed
as if men are some Sanctum sanctorum.

12:46.329 --> 12:52.240
I feel the slavery of women is much more in
the West than in India.

12:52.240 --> 12:56.530
Interviewer: And how about the Koran?

12:56.530 --> 12:58.149
I’m speaking about the Iranians.

12:58.149 --> 13:03.610
I know you did a programme this week and it
was a very important programme.

13:03.610 --> 13:08.819
And I’d like to talk about how the Iranian
people have misinterpreted Mohamed and the

13:08.819 --> 13:13.350
effects on their society and the importance
of their changing for women.

13:13.350 --> 13:14.350
[unsure]

13:14.350 --> 13:15.350
Shri Mataji: Yes.

13:15.350 --> 13:18.649
Even Muhammad Sahib, you see, he respected
women so much.

13:18.649 --> 13:20.370
You know, they used to have wars.

13:20.370 --> 13:21.370
They were tribes.

13:21.370 --> 13:22.649
They were tribal people.

13:22.649 --> 13:26.959
It was only Muhammad Sahib who could take
birth in those horrible Arabs.

13:26.959 --> 13:32.170
And he found that so many men, young men were
killed.

13:32.170 --> 13:33.439
So he said: “Alright.

13:33.439 --> 13:39.690
If there are not young men, let the old men
marry, even young girl.

13:39.690 --> 13:41.079
It doesn’t matter but marry.

13:41.079 --> 13:46.670
Even if they have to marry five times, marry
so that they do not become prostitutes.

13:46.670 --> 13:52.009
Just to respect their chastity he prescribed
this thing but it is not compulsory that you

13:52.009 --> 13:53.279
should marry five times.

13:53.279 --> 13:56.879
You see, we have horrible things in India.

13:56.879 --> 14:02.410
A man marries four times, has eight children
each time because they believe that but that

14:02.410 --> 14:04.600
democracy [demography?], they’ll be powerful.

14:04.600 --> 14:12.129
Then, after some time, they divorce their
wives by saying three times: “Talaq, talaq,

14:12.129 --> 14:13.129
talaq."

14:13.129 --> 14:14.129
[repudiation].

14:14.129 --> 14:17.920
Now, these women are with so many children,
are just left on the street.

14:17.920 --> 14:26.420
And if you see them you’ll think that this
is worse than Somalia.

14:26.420 --> 14:27.939
He respected women!

14:27.939 --> 14:33.689
Not only, he told his wife that: “You are
going to work out- Aicha” he told her: “You

14:33.689 --> 14:37.620
are going to work out something against the
religion."

14:37.620 --> 14:44.490
And really it was wrong on her because his
own daughter, as you know her name was Fatima,

14:44.490 --> 14:48.649
stood up and said that: “This, never Muhammad
Sahib has said it."

14:48.649 --> 14:56.430
But this Abu-Bakr is a fellow who just took
the platform, as it is, I should say, instead

14:56.430 --> 15:01.019
of his own son in law, Hazrat Ali, who was
a great Realized soul.

15:01.019 --> 15:10.499
And he just completely changed the ideas about
women which Fatima was going to tell.

15:10.499 --> 15:17.699
So there were big wars called Karbala in which
two children of Fatimabi were killed, Hazrat

15:17.699 --> 15:24.459
Ali was also killed and there two groups which
were formed, one is Shia and Sunni.

15:24.459 --> 15:31.129
But Shias also don’t understand that they
have to respect their women because Fatimabi

15:31.129 --> 15:34.860
herself was a, not only a saint but an incarnation.

15:34.860 --> 15:36.860
She was a Goddess.

15:36.860 --> 15:43.360
Interviewer: How has the media affected our
view of women today?

15:43.360 --> 15:50.920
Shri Mataji: In the Western media I must say
that women are used just to lure or some sort

15:50.920 --> 15:56.680
of a very low type of human beings I should
say.

15:56.680 --> 15:58.850
Men are not sex points.

15:58.850 --> 15:59.889
They are the Spirit.

15:59.889 --> 16:03.700
They are reduced to this sex point by Freud.

16:03.700 --> 16:08.980
And Freud was like a Christ here once upon
a time.

16:08.980 --> 16:14.059
Now of course, after so many years, I said
this at least twenty years back.

16:14.059 --> 16:20.480
But now it is appearing, many- I’ve seen
some books like “Fall of Freudian Empire”

16:20.480 --> 16:23.629
“Freudian Freud”, so many books are coming
now!

16:23.629 --> 16:25.670
Already all the harm has been done!

16:25.670 --> 16:32.350
Human beings are reduced to a sex point now
by media and women who are very cheap who

16:32.350 --> 16:40.920
can expose their body and can sell their chastity
are regarded as great heroines.

16:40.920 --> 16:41.920
This is what?

16:41.920 --> 16:43.589
It’s the situation of the media that is
today.

16:43.589 --> 16:47.790
Interviewer: I heard you have even said that
Freud can only prosper in America.

16:47.790 --> 16:48.899
Shri Mataji: Hum?

16:48.899 --> 16:50.529
Interviewer: Freud can only prosper in America.

16:50.529 --> 16:51.529
Shri Mataji: Yes.

16:51.529 --> 16:52.529
Interviewer: You said that.

16:52.529 --> 16:53.529
Shri Mataji: It’s a fact.

16:53.529 --> 16:58.620
He was born in Austria and when I talked against
Freud they all clapped.

16:58.620 --> 17:01.999
They were very happy I said so because they
were quite ashamed about him.

17:01.999 --> 17:10.560
But even in Austria, you find so many prostitutes
on the streets, standing all the while.

17:10.560 --> 17:14.589
But here, at least, there it is, the housewives
are housewives.

17:14.589 --> 17:19.490
Here, even housewife has to dress up in such
a way that she should be like a prostitute.

17:19.490 --> 17:21.760
Why should you do that?

17:21.760 --> 17:22.760
You must have your self-respect.

17:22.760 --> 17:28.870
Interviewer: How is this special time for
women?

17:28.870 --> 17:37.670
Shri Mataji: I call it this a Blossom time
because I say they are many flowers, so many

17:37.670 --> 17:45.090
some of them are on the Earth and they are
to become now fruits.

17:45.090 --> 17:52.580
But it’s called as Qiyamah in the Koran,
meaning the Resurrection time.

17:52.580 --> 17:59.310
Even in the Indian scriptures, we have this
Resurrection time and by many astrologers,

17:59.310 --> 18:05.680
thousands of years back, it was predicted
that such and such time will come.

18:05.680 --> 18:09.710
And also in the Bible, it is the Last Judgement.

18:09.710 --> 18:17.570
There’s another stupid idea which we find
in Bible and also in Koran, which is very

18:17.570 --> 18:22.840
stupid, and I think also- I don’t know about
the Torah, but they said that there is also

18:22.840 --> 18:28.910
the same idea previously – that, at the
time of Resurrection our dead bodies will

18:28.910 --> 18:32.030
come out of the graves and then they’ll
ascend.

18:32.030 --> 18:36.540
Now, tell Me what is left in the grave of
the dead bodies?

18:36.540 --> 18:40.280
It is so absurd, it’s so illogical.

18:40.280 --> 18:44.810
Actually, in that way, I would say Indian
scriptures said the correct thing that at

18:44.810 --> 18:51.370
this time of Kali Yuga all the souls which
are lost, all the souls who want their Realization,

18:51.370 --> 19:01.310
all the souls who have been thinking of God
and seeking God all over the world, will be

19:01.310 --> 19:02.310
reborn.

19:02.310 --> 19:05.290
That’s why we have a population problem.

19:05.290 --> 19:10.740
That is why all kinds of horrible people are
also born.

19:10.740 --> 19:14.340
In this time, about twenty years back, your
media was much better.

19:14.340 --> 19:17.630
They didn’t show such horrible scenes.

19:17.630 --> 19:21.360
I mean they must show bedroom’s scenes,
what is the need?

19:21.360 --> 19:22.420
Bathroom scenes.

19:22.420 --> 19:27.400
I mean, if somebody comes into your house,
do you take them to your bedroom, into your

19:27.400 --> 19:29.480
bathroom or you keep them in the dining room?

19:29.480 --> 19:32.060
I mean, it’s private life.

19:32.060 --> 19:34.380
They have no respect for privacy.

19:34.380 --> 19:41.800
Now, you see, this kind of funny idea that
we are going to get out of the graves and

19:41.800 --> 19:48.580
all that is still lingering in the mind of
many ignorant Christians and also Muslims.

19:48.580 --> 19:52.380
One Bosnia fellow met Me, he was Muslim.

19:52.380 --> 19:56.450
I asked him: “Why were you dying there,
what was the need to die?”

19:56.450 --> 20:00.400
He said: “Because if we die now in the name
of God, we’ll be resurrected."

20:00.400 --> 20:01.400
[Interviewer is laughing.]

20:01.400 --> 20:06.800
Shri Mataji: I mean it is relevant from the
idea of Bible, you see?

20:06.800 --> 20:13.750
So this is what it is that these ideas are
to be put right.

20:13.750 --> 20:18.710
In the west, you see, we have Christianity,
we have other religions.

20:18.710 --> 20:26.710
But, I would say that the roots of the spiritual
knowledge, it’s more in India.

20:26.710 --> 20:30.080
I’m myself born in a Christian religion.

20:30.080 --> 20:37.300
But the roots about it, the explanation about
it, is much better discovered in India because

20:37.300 --> 20:42.450
it’s an ancient country which has been all
the times seeking, seeking, for thousands

20:42.450 --> 20:46.150
of years.

20:46.150 --> 20:50.010
Now the system that is Sahaja Yoga as you
mentioned is not mine.

20:50.010 --> 20:52.550
It’s an ancient system.

20:52.550 --> 20:58.680
But we had this system in the Nath Panthis,
they call it, that they were in the centre.

20:58.680 --> 21:04.080
And one master will have only one disciple,
this was the tradition.

21:04.080 --> 21:09.290
So there were very few people who got their
Realization.

21:09.290 --> 21:15.260
Shri Rama’s father-in-law’s guru was Ashtavakra.

21:15.260 --> 21:16.700
He has written about sahaj.

21:16.700 --> 21:26.220
But he has just described what happens when
you get into the state of Spirit.

21:26.220 --> 21:31.920
This father-in-law, Janaka, gave Realization
to only one person Natchiketa according to

21:31.920 --> 21:32.920
the tradition.

21:32.920 --> 21:42.410
But, on the twelve century, there was a great
poet in India, in Maharashtra, born as Gnyaneshwara,

21:42.410 --> 21:47.250
who asked his guru, his own brother that:
“Let me also tell about this."

21:47.250 --> 21:49.570
He said: “All right”.

21:49.570 --> 21:51.160
He permitted.

21:51.160 --> 21:58.170
So in his Gnyaneshwari which is just the explanation
of Gita, he has clearly said in the sixth

21:58.170 --> 22:04.350
chapter about Kundalini, how she rises, how
she gives you Realization and everything.

22:04.350 --> 22:11.080
But those people who were in charge of religion,
as usual, didn’t know how to do it.

22:11.080 --> 22:16.580
So what they did, they said:” This is “nisidhat”
[forbid] – means, cancelled- you don’t

22:16.580 --> 22:17.870
read this sixth chapter."

22:17.870 --> 22:19.480
So nobody would read that chapter.

22:19.480 --> 22:23.910
That’s how it went into background!

22:23.910 --> 22:34.290
So I would say, after that, many great saints
like Guru Nanak, Kabir, Sukarama, Ramdas,

22:34.290 --> 22:41.270
in the sixteen century, did a great work of
Kundalini [inaudible].

22:41.270 --> 22:45.800
Even in the Bible, it is: “I will appear
before you as tongues of flames."

22:45.800 --> 22:48.590
“Tree of life” so many things are described!

22:48.590 --> 22:54.420
But in the little time that they had, they
could not explain so much.

22:54.420 --> 22:59.000
Now, these people have talked about Kundalini
and said about it.

22:59.000 --> 23:08.000
If I have done any work, is this, that by
studying through human beings, I met many

23:08.000 --> 23:12.880
people because my father was a very social
man and my husband was in a position where

23:12.880 --> 23:14.270
I met many people.

23:14.270 --> 23:22.820
I studied human beings and I found out a method
by which you can now give a-mass Realization.

23:22.820 --> 23:30.040
In Russia, in Bulgaria, Romania, we always
have people in the stadium, not less than

23:30.040 --> 23:34.920
sixteen thousand, and they all get their Realization!

23:34.920 --> 23:38.540
And they are very sensitive to spirituality
and they stick to it.

23:38.540 --> 23:41.000
None of these false gurus could stick there.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.290
Interviewer: Psychics, the issue of psychics,
it’s so popular here!

23:45.290 --> 23:49.140
And we are very-it’s very dangerous.

23:49.140 --> 23:50.630
Could you explain what can happen?

23:50.630 --> 23:51.870
Shri Mataji: Ah.

23:51.870 --> 23:55.140
Americans are very simple people I must say.

23:55.140 --> 23:59.370
First time I came for parapsychology, they
took Me into a hall of parapsychology.

23:59.370 --> 24:03.010
They told Me: “You are dealing with dead
spirits!”

24:03.010 --> 24:05.350
And they were very angry with Me.

24:05.350 --> 24:07.840
He says that: “You come as guest and why
do crusade?

24:07.840 --> 24:08.840
[unsure]."

24:08.840 --> 24:10.280
I said: “I have to tell you the truth, I
am your Mother.

24:10.280 --> 24:12.870
I’m not your guest, you didn’t pay for
Me.

24:12.870 --> 24:17.750
I came on my own, coming on my vehicle and
going on my vehicle”, while they made money

24:17.750 --> 24:18.750
out of Me.

24:18.750 --> 24:20.840
So, they don’t like it.

24:20.840 --> 24:27.580
When I first came here, when I told them that:
“These are all spirits and psychic things

24:27.580 --> 24:29.990
and don’t do it”, they didn’t like it.

24:29.990 --> 24:31.810
Interviewer: How can we know of false guru?

24:31.810 --> 24:38.100
Shri Mataji: First of all, you cannot pay
for your Self Realization!

24:38.100 --> 24:40.130
Or for any knowledge.

24:40.130 --> 24:41.630
You must value your life.

24:41.630 --> 24:46.600
If you don’t value your life, then you’ll
go to all such stupid people and you’ll

24:46.600 --> 24:47.600
waste your time.

24:47.600 --> 24:53.830
No, if you value you life, if you value your
money for example, you’ll first find out

24:53.830 --> 24:55.900
what it this you are buying.

24:55.900 --> 25:04.160
First of all you must see the disciples, what
are they doing, what is their style what are

25:04.160 --> 25:06.280
they gaining, what is their knowledge.

25:06.280 --> 25:08.140
First the disciples!

25:08.140 --> 25:10.360
Most of them are recluses.

25:10.360 --> 25:14.860
Anything which is sort of fashionable, people
want to do.

25:14.860 --> 25:18.430
You talk of individuality, all right?

25:18.430 --> 25:22.660
Any entrepreneur, now they just started a
six inches of skirt, everybody wears six inches

25:22.660 --> 25:23.800
of skirt!

25:23.800 --> 25:27.360
Otherwise you are not “in”, means in the
lunatic asylum.

25:27.360 --> 25:34.410
So like that, these people are good at big
advertisement, marketing, writing books, all

25:34.410 --> 25:35.410
falsehood!

25:35.410 --> 25:41.980
You believe them because they have a knack,
advertisement is the main thing which has

25:41.980 --> 25:48.100
led to this kind of things and Americans are
really very sensitive to advertising.

25:48.100 --> 25:50.550
If anything is advertised, they think it’s
great.

25:50.550 --> 25:56.880
Also I was surprised when I came here, they
asked Me – in Boston, I remember- they asked

25:56.880 --> 26:00.470
Me: “How many Roll Royce you have?”, in
the television.

26:00.470 --> 26:01.940
I said: “I don’t have!”

26:01.940 --> 26:04.510
They said then: “You don’t make any money."

26:04.510 --> 26:05.510
“No."

26:05.510 --> 26:06.510
I said: “I don’t make any money."

26:06.510 --> 26:07.510
“So there’s no business."

26:07.510 --> 26:08.510
“No”, I said “no”.

26:08.510 --> 26:09.510
“Then we are not interested."

26:09.510 --> 26:12.650
They wouldn’t have Me on the television.

26:12.650 --> 26:19.010
I mean you are so money oriented that tomorrow
you’ll purchase God also I think.

26:19.010 --> 26:22.520
So, first of all, you cannot pay for it.

26:22.520 --> 26:27.930
Second, you must see the disciples, what sort
of disciples they are, what they are, how

26:27.930 --> 26:32.850
much they are talking about the knowledge.

26:32.850 --> 26:34.400
They must have the knowledge.

26:34.400 --> 26:47.720
Now you know very well, and people can find
out that in Sahaja Yoga people just get Realization

26:47.720 --> 26:50.400
and start giving Realizations to others.

26:50.400 --> 26:53.510
So many diseases have been cured.

26:53.510 --> 26:54.760
It’s a fact, there’s a book written.

26:54.760 --> 26:56.160
Interviewer: So we are in a new stage, a new
evolution.

26:56.160 --> 27:01.490
Shri Mataji: Of course, this is the time,
if you miss it, you’ll miss it for ever!

27:01.490 --> 27:06.990
Because, you see, otherwise, you see in America,
people are getting destroyed from within.

27:06.990 --> 27:13.120
All kinds of diseases, psychological problems,
this, that, stress, this, that, all kind of

27:13.120 --> 27:14.630
things are going on.

27:14.630 --> 27:19.190
Now, to stop it, better ascend above all these
things.

27:19.190 --> 27:21.820
Interviewer: Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

27:21.820 --> 27:52.300
Please join us for part two of this special
program on “Audrey Hope’s real women”.
