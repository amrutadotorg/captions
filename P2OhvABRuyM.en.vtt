00:02.135 --> 00:05.296
The other day I was telling you

00:05.416 --> 00:10.270
about our growth within, after Self-realisation.

00:10.849 --> 00:17.951
The germination takes place very easily;

00:18.189 --> 00:23.606
the Kundalini rises very easily;

00:23.726 --> 00:33.789
also pierces the fontanelle bone area very easily.

00:34.079 --> 00:38.129
That is really, as you call it, ‘Sahaja’.

00:39.827 --> 00:42.261
It’s a tremendous happening.

00:42.381 --> 00:47.417
It takes thousands of years for people to get realisation.

00:47.537 --> 00:49.691
That’s also a fact.

00:51.199 --> 00:53.749
They had to be born again and again

00:53.869 --> 00:59.659
and very few selected got realisation.

01:01.212 --> 01:05.213
But today, as I said, the time has come

01:08.296 --> 01:12.743
for many flowers to become fruits.

01:14.382 --> 01:19.202
So this happening doesn’t take much time,

01:19.515 --> 01:23.217
it’s just [a] split of a second in many people.

01:24.058 --> 01:28.181
But about the growth I was talking last time,

01:28.301 --> 01:33.757
I ended up at Self-realisation, what is Self-realisation is

01:33.877 --> 01:39.062
and what do we expect from Self-realisation.

01:40.261 --> 01:43.599
The first thing that happens to you, as you know,

01:43.719 --> 01:46.342
when the Kundalini rises, [is]

01:48.922 --> 01:54.309
that you start feeling physically better; your health improves.

01:55.323 --> 02:01.085
Though the Kundalini rises from the centre most nadi,

02:01.205 --> 02:05.828
called as Brahmanadi, inside the Sushumna, in the central part.

02:06.677 --> 02:16.331
And first thing that happens is the physical being which is helped.

02:18.101 --> 02:23.369
That is not the innermost core of every centre.

02:23.489 --> 02:29.910
The innermost core of every centre is the Spiritual.

02:32.188 --> 02:35.815
But how is it [that] first the physical being is helped?

02:35.935 --> 02:38.215
Is very interesting to see.

02:39.747 --> 02:48.768
The Kundalini rises through many centres, passes through Agya,

02:48.888 --> 02:50.837
pierces through fontanelle,

02:50.957 --> 02:55.484
and becomes one with the All-pervading Power.

02:58.472 --> 03:04.548
So, first thing that receives the information is the seat of Sadashiva,

03:04.668 --> 03:10.078
is the seat of your Atma, your Spirit, on top of your head.

03:10.198 --> 03:12.899
But the Spirit is in your heart.

03:13.019 --> 03:17.331
So the first awakening takes place, or enlightenment takes place,

03:17.451 --> 03:21.335
in your brain. It’s a very important point to be seen.

03:24.385 --> 03:28.639
In your brain resides the conscious mind,

03:30.289 --> 03:32.666
that means the present,

03:34.658 --> 03:41.993
and when it is enlightened that means your awareness is enlightened;

03:42.113 --> 03:45.582
you get enlightenment in your awareness,

03:48.237 --> 03:50.200
in your attention.

03:50.320 --> 03:54.711
As I told you last time that attention is enlightened first.

03:54.831 --> 03:57.193
So through your attention you can find out

03:57.313 --> 04:00.157
what is the matter with other persons, you can find out

04:00.277 --> 04:01.928
what centres are catching,

04:02.048 --> 04:06.885
what your centres are catching. So, on the physical level,

04:11.507 --> 04:14.157
you know what’s happening.

04:16.173 --> 04:20.258
That’s the, we should say, the present.

04:21.504 --> 04:25.255
We feel our gross (physical) being enlightened,

04:25.375 --> 04:29.425
we can feel them on our fingers.

04:32.124 --> 04:38.856
But when the Kundalini is rising in your being,

04:40.316 --> 04:46.261
She goes straight on to the fontanelle bone area.

04:46.793 --> 04:50.741
Of course, if there is a hurdle or anything then She stops

04:50.861 --> 04:53.340
and tries to indicate.

04:56.403 --> 04:59.778
At that time, if She is not successful,

04:59.898 --> 05:03.095
for example you have got a liver problem,

05:03.215 --> 05:05.265
then She will come and throb at liver problem,

05:05.385 --> 05:09.283
informing you that there’s something wrong with the liver.

05:09.403 --> 05:14.560
That’s why a Sahaja Yogi has to give vibrations from outside.

05:16.671 --> 05:23.993
When the Kundalini rises above the Agya,

05:26.638 --> 05:30.316
She goes up to this fontanelle and pierces.

05:30.436 --> 05:35.567
But when She cannot go beyond Agya She spreads out here.

05:37.384 --> 05:40.404
She can spread out here also.

05:41.555 --> 05:45.261
And then She starts trickling down,

05:46.705 --> 05:48.885
the grace on the…

05:50.426 --> 05:55.892
or you can say She starts relaxing

05:56.567 --> 06:00.444
this area which is called as murdha (brain)

06:00.670 --> 06:06.807
and that’s how She makes more space in the Agya.

06:07.175 --> 06:12.659
And this relaxation works out the outer side of the physical being.

06:13.555 --> 06:16.196
Also when She pierces through

06:16.316 --> 06:25.113
in anyone who has a simpler personality,

06:25.233 --> 06:30.001
who is not so complicated, first thing that happens

06:30.121 --> 06:34.110
is that the grace starts falling through from the sides;

06:34.230 --> 06:41.205
and the Grace starts falling into the Ida and Pingala

06:42.625 --> 06:49.156
and then She comes down by which She supplies Ida and Pingala.

06:49.276 --> 06:52.040
The Grace, not the Kundalini,

06:52.160 --> 06:55.563
you should not confuse these two things.

06:56.809 --> 06:59.316
Because of Her piercing, there’s an opening made

06:59.436 --> 07:04.698
and the Grace starts coming down, and She,

07:05.333 --> 07:13.255
I should say the Grace Itself, feeds all the centres from outside.

07:14.548 --> 07:18.618
So, first the physical being is improves.

07:23.565 --> 07:31.536
The second one, I’m now going from outside inside,

07:34.251 --> 07:42.183
the second one is the mental being.

07:44.516 --> 07:49.384
Now the mental being relates to our awareness as well,

07:50.510 --> 07:55.672
also to our sense of understanding, intellect and all those things.

07:57.133 --> 08:01.416
When the Grace starts flowing more and more within us,

08:01.536 --> 08:05.786
then our mental being gets enlightened.

08:07.445 --> 08:09.276
When the mental being gets enlightened

08:09.396 --> 08:14.209
then you start feeling centres of other persons.

08:16.588 --> 08:20.167
Some people you know just get cured.

08:20.952 --> 08:24.625
They don’t feel any vibrations, nothing, just they feel cured.

08:24.745 --> 08:28.670
They get cured of cancer, this, that, all sorts of things.

08:28.790 --> 08:32.340
But they do not get vibrations, they do not get a feeling,

08:32.460 --> 08:36.517
they cannot make out whether it is this chakra or that chakra,

08:36.637 --> 08:38.927
they do not feel anything.

08:40.966 --> 08:45.712
So the first thing that would happen to anyone is the physical gift,

08:45.832 --> 08:50.684
the physical being improves – that’s the Grace of God.

08:51.723 --> 08:53.782
Because if you are not well,

08:53.902 --> 08:58.079
if you have some pains and some troubles and some diseases,

08:58.199 --> 09:02.363
how are you going to pay attention to God and Spirit?

09:03.411 --> 09:05.708
That’s very important.

09:07.874 --> 09:11.445
But before it comes to the mental self,

09:14.962 --> 09:17.929
something else happens also,

09:20.103 --> 09:23.450
that, when the Kundalini pierces,

09:25.085 --> 09:31.392
the falling of Grace first comes down

09:32.903 --> 09:38.457
to the lower centres starting from Nabhi downwards.

09:39.799 --> 09:46.257
And Nabhi is a great sucker, Nabhi starts sucking the vibrations,

09:46.377 --> 09:48.976
or you can say the Grace.

09:49.738 --> 09:55.659
And Nabhi starts getting awakened first of all.

09:56.452 --> 10:01.473
From Nabhi rises the Swadhishthana Chakra which goes round and round,

10:01.593 --> 10:07.630
which is connected with Nabhi, so it flows to Swadhishthana

10:08.154 --> 10:14.582
and then Swadhishthana also starts working out itself.

10:18.205 --> 10:21.250
Swadhishthana sucks in as much as possible

10:21.370 --> 10:25.005
and works out all the centres,

10:25.125 --> 10:29.220
I mean all the organs, which are supplied by it.

10:31.982 --> 10:40.709
But Nabhi, when it receives surplus Grace,

10:42.627 --> 10:45.300
then it starts opening,

10:47.776 --> 10:57.805
and its opening helps us in very gross material life also.

11:00.709 --> 11:03.259
You are helped materially.

11:03.379 --> 11:07.309
Supposing if you are materially absolutely hopeless,

11:07.429 --> 11:11.344
then you are not going to pay attention to God also.

11:11.464 --> 11:14.022
So it’s the responsibility of God

11:14.142 --> 11:17.374
to first give you a little material well-being.

11:17.494 --> 11:20.227
Like I received a letter and also on the tape

11:20.347 --> 11:26.017
they have mentioned about somebody who wanted to come to India, from Australia.

11:26.517 --> 11:30.264
She got her realisation, she felt very much better,

11:30.581 --> 11:36.519
and she wanted to come to India but she had no money to come,

11:36.639 --> 11:42.194
and that desire was there. Because of that desire in her

11:42.314 --> 11:48.715
she may not have put full attention to her Spirit.

11:50.508 --> 11:54.851
And that’s how our material desires get satisfied.

11:55.360 --> 11:59.695
And her daughter discovered, she had a bracelet,

11:59.815 --> 12:02.978
many bracelets and things she had, and she went to a jumble sale,

12:03.098 --> 12:10.071
for selling them for some sort of a programme they had for children.

12:10.365 --> 12:14.046
And they discovered that one of the bracelets that she had,

12:14.166 --> 12:19.421
which she thought to be a junk, was of gold, surprisingly.

12:19.541 --> 12:23.508
And she sold it for $1500.

12:23.628 --> 12:27.859
She was going to sell it for 20c, you see,.

12:27.979 --> 12:34.137
And that was exactly the amount needed for their travel, for both of them.

12:34.867 --> 12:39.164
Now one would say that – how it works out?

12:40.922 --> 12:46.849
It is miraculous, that’s all I can say, because the machinery is such.

12:47.666 --> 12:58.749
The pouring of the Grace within you, informs the Lakshmi Principle in the Nabhi.

12:58.869 --> 13:00.624
Nabhi just show them where is this.

13:00.744 --> 13:02.896
Somebody has to get up and show them,

13:03.016 --> 13:06.768
Douglas? Or someone. Douglas (Fry) come along.

13:09.755 --> 13:15.269
This is the one. And this has the deity of Lakshmi,

13:15.389 --> 13:18.471
She is the deity of your well-being.

13:18.932 --> 13:22.992
And this is what Krishna has said, “Yoga Kshema vahamyam”

13:23.112 --> 13:24.447
“When the yoga takes place,

13:24.567 --> 13:28.148
means when the Kundalini pierces through fontanelle bone area,

13:28.268 --> 13:33.933
I look after your well-being.” How does he look after? Through Lakshmi.

13:34.417 --> 13:41.240
Now this is a universal Deity. She’s present in human beings

13:41.360 --> 13:45.993
and also she is present in material things.

13:49.782 --> 13:53.583
It is such a fantastic thing

13:55.317 --> 13:58.562
that you cannot explain these things

13:58.682 --> 14:01.287
on human level, really it is difficult.

14:01.407 --> 14:05.052
Only thing you can see for yourself how it works out.

14:05.172 --> 14:08.946
It’s so tremendous. Like if you have to explain

14:09.066 --> 14:12.711
about human civilisation to an ant it’s going to be difficult –

14:12.831 --> 14:16.087
in the same way it is. It’s so difficult you see.

14:16.207 --> 14:19.071
And human beings they are so proud of their rationality

14:19.191 --> 14:22.758
and I find it impossible how to explain, but it does work that way.

14:22.878 --> 14:25.666
You can only see the working of it.

14:26.167 --> 14:29.637
But if you are proud of your rationality you go ahead with it,

14:29.757 --> 14:34.697
what can you do? But you just see for yourself how it works.

14:36.162 --> 14:42.183
So the second layer that really is improved is your material being.

14:42.303 --> 14:47.418
So many people have been helped, who are here, materially.

14:50.525 --> 14:56.458
The well-being has come, actual well-being, apart from satisfaction.

14:56.578 --> 14:59.279
But as I said, it does not cross the limit,

14:59.399 --> 15:01.998
like you do not become Mr. Ford!

15:03.950 --> 15:08.419
Because that’s some sort of a behaviour which is asahaja,

15:08.539 --> 15:12.423
to be so rich, I mean it’s ridiculous, vulgar!

15:14.518 --> 15:21.400
You become better than what you are, but not the best,

15:21.995 --> 15:28.652
because you have to be in the centre at a satisfied point.

15:28.930 --> 15:32.103
And everybody has to enjoy you

15:34.820 --> 15:37.361
and you have to enjoy everybody.

15:37.481 --> 15:42.591
But supposing if you are in dire necessities and problematic things

15:42.733 --> 15:46.596
then you cannot pay attention to God and that’s what He understands –

15:46.716 --> 15:47.873
that you cannot.

15:47.993 --> 15:51.393
If you have physical problem, if you have cancer,

15:51.513 --> 15:54.119
how can you say that, “You pay attention to your Spirit,”

15:54.239 --> 15:56.176
when you have cancer? I mean, such a body!

15:56.296 --> 15:59.187
After all if this whole house is going to collapse

15:59.307 --> 16:01.490
you cannot meditate here.

16:02.530 --> 16:08.219
So, first the physical stability is established and second is the material one.

16:08.989 --> 16:14.459
And there are many factors which work out material stability, automatically.

16:15.871 --> 16:20.615
First of them is that, once you find your Spirit,

16:22.694 --> 16:27.861
you just automatically give up your habits.

16:28.639 --> 16:31.795
Most of these habits come from your Nabhi,

16:31.915 --> 16:35.498
because from Nabhi Chakra you get your seeking.

16:35.950 --> 16:39.994
And you think, when you have a habit [that] you are seeking your joy.

16:40.114 --> 16:44.673
I mean, many people have said, “Mother, but I enjoy my glass of whiskey,”

16:44.793 --> 16:46.899
they have said to me, many a times.

16:47.019 --> 16:51.085
Or, “I enjoy a little ride here and there,”

16:51.205 --> 16:55.014
somebody has said that, “Mother, I enjoy some Kensington ladies,”

16:55.134 --> 16:57.078
you see, sort of thing.

16:57.507 --> 17:01.742
But once you start enjoying your Spirit, it drops out.

17:01.862 --> 17:09.876
All your attention becomes enlightened and your priorities change.

17:09.996 --> 17:12.690
You don’t enjoy these things that you have been enjoying before,

17:12.816 --> 17:15.218
so you just don’t do it. I mean, I don’t have to tell you,

17:15.361 --> 17:17.677
“Don’t drink!” you just don’t do it.

17:17.797 --> 17:20.947
I don’t have to tell you that you don’t smoke, you just don’t do.

17:21.074 --> 17:23.965
But there are some very weak people, extremely weak, I mean,

17:24.085 --> 17:26.633
very, very weak people. They take time, I know.

17:26.753 --> 17:34.707
They plod and they are very slow moving creatures, but not all.

17:41.001 --> 17:45.825
I would say quite a small number and

17:47.325 --> 17:52.740
most of the people, they just give up things. You just give up.

17:53.248 --> 17:56.926
So you start saving money, automatically,

17:58.061 --> 18:02.724
because the money goes to the races or to the pubs

18:02.844 --> 18:06.105
or to other habits which are useless, you know they are useless:

18:06.225 --> 18:08.837
smoking, drugs,

18:08.957 --> 18:13.991
any such foolish things that you are wasting money on.

18:14.111 --> 18:21.212
And you start channelizing this money for something better,

18:21.338 --> 18:23.682
something that gives you more joy,

18:23.802 --> 18:27.535
more happiness and of an eternal nature, not a temporary one,

18:27.655 --> 18:30.282
that you take the drink [the] previous night

18:30.402 --> 18:32.520
and in the morning you are finished!

18:32.640 --> 18:38.787
You get a drink that never finishes, which you enjoy all the time.

18:38.954 --> 18:43.873
You get drunk like that. Because in my own life I have seen,

18:46.324 --> 18:52.291
it’s such a so-called sophisticated elite life.

18:52.411 --> 18:56.211
People drink much more, you see, than normal people drink.

18:56.544 --> 18:59.621
And they ask me, “Why don’t you drink?” I say, “I am already drunk!

18:59.822 --> 19:02.004
The day I was born I was so drunk that, now,

19:02.124 --> 19:05.784
if I have to drink more I’ll fall off, so better not ask me!”

19:05.904 --> 19:08.486
They are quite frightened at my, this thing,

19:08.606 --> 19:11.641
I said, “I am really fully drunk already!”

19:11.776 --> 19:13.857
So they start looking at me!

19:13.977 --> 19:21.442
And they never find me anyway less in spirits as they are.

19:21.562 --> 19:24.424
Actually I’m always little more than they are,

19:24.544 --> 19:27.015
so they never force me to do that.

19:27.135 --> 19:30.978
But these things drop out automatically.

19:31.098 --> 19:34.124
I don’t have to tell you that you have to drop out.

19:34.244 --> 19:36.111
Because most of the things you have done

19:36.231 --> 19:38.221
because you have been seeking something.

19:38.341 --> 19:41.630
You know, there are people, I asked them, “Why do you do this?”

19:41.750 --> 19:44.265
They said, “We are seeking love,” I said “How?

19:44.385 --> 19:47.338
How can you find love like this?” Or somebody will say that,

19:47.458 --> 19:50.238
“I am seeking God.” There are many people who are taking drugs,

19:50.358 --> 19:53.018
I mean, genuinely, just for seeking.

19:53.138 --> 19:55.974
But when they have found it, what they were seeking,

19:56.094 --> 20:00.487
they don’t take drugs. But this is one of the side issues,

20:00.607 --> 20:03.425
I was just trying to make it little lighter.

20:03.545 --> 20:08.987
But mainly what happens is that, actually the principle of Lakshmi,

20:09.107 --> 20:13.800
the principle of well-being within you is awakened.

20:16.396 --> 20:20.969
And if you listen to one of my tapes where I have described

20:21.089 --> 20:25.479
what a Lakshmi is, and how She is symbolised:

20:25.599 --> 20:29.264
it’s a very beautiful picture of Lakshmi

20:29.637 --> 20:34.521
that the great seers have put before us:

20:34.641 --> 20:40.399
That, She is after all a Mother, She is a mother.

20:40.733 --> 20:47.931
A person who is a rich man has to be a motherly person.

20:49.006 --> 20:52.185
But here you find, in the whole world I have seen [that]

20:52.305 --> 20:55.917
those who have even little money their nose goes up like that

20:56.037 --> 21:00.572
and if you see them from down below they look like wolves

21:00.692 --> 21:03.933
not like mothers – most surprising.

21:04.433 --> 21:12.426
And this Lakshmi who is a Mother, wears a white sari,

21:13.926 --> 21:17.972
very elegant, with a gold border.

21:19.043 --> 21:25.155
That represents that he doesn’t put people into awe

21:26.195 --> 21:29.603
by his pomp and show and this and that.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.680
She’s standing on a lotus.

21:33.800 --> 21:37.763
Imagine any human being standing on a lotus!

21:39.859 --> 21:50.331
That means that She’s so light in Her behaviour towards others.

21:51.465 --> 21:56.892
She’s so delicate, She touches people with such delicacy,

21:57.012 --> 22:00.490
that people don’t feel hurt,

22:00.610 --> 22:09.168
they are not in any way pressurized by the riches of people.

22:09.557 --> 22:11.306
But you know it’s just the opposite,

22:11.426 --> 22:14.586
if your so-called ‘rich’ you see! Horrible!

22:14.706 --> 22:19.731
If somebody’s coming in here I would like to get out of that door.

22:20.763 --> 22:23.059
They try to pressurise because they have money.

22:23.179 --> 22:27.713
You see, if somebody starts talking big, you just find out,

22:27.943 --> 22:32.525
99% he must have won some horse race!

22:34.719 --> 22:39.536
This pressurising is a sign that he is not a lakshmipati,

22:39.656 --> 22:44.793
he has nothing to do with Lakshmi. So he’s so gracious.

22:48.698 --> 22:53.542
I have seen such people. I have seen some people like that.

22:54.447 --> 22:59.138
I have seen one in England you will be surprised to know.

22:59.937 --> 23:04.418
I have just seen him once. He was a gentleman

23:04.538 --> 23:07.127
who was some lord and something

23:07.247 --> 23:12.054
and later on he came to India and he was a Viceroy (Lord Mountbatten).

23:14.181 --> 23:18.086
And there was a gentleman who was very well known to us,

23:18.206 --> 23:23.416
he once met him in a train which was delayed or something happened

23:23.536 --> 23:26.633
and they had to get down at another station

23:26.753 --> 23:28.771
and somehow or other they were put together.

23:28.891 --> 23:33.059
And he was so simple and so good and so helpful

23:33.179 --> 23:39.210
that this gentleman was taken by him.

23:39.331 --> 23:41.607
He said, “Now better you come to my house because

23:41.728 --> 23:44.266
it’s not going to be any train, you come to my house.”

23:44.386 --> 23:46.449
When he went to his house he was surprised

23:46.570 --> 23:51.248
the house was like a palace! And then he told he who he was,

23:51.369 --> 23:56.897
and he was amazed! And he even carried his bag with him.

23:57.017 --> 24:01.569
Such a simple man. And then, when this person told me

24:01.689 --> 24:04.723
that such a person is there, then he re-visited India,

24:04.843 --> 24:06.441
then he brought him to see me.

24:06.561 --> 24:09.252
But he’s no more now he’s dead this gentleman.

24:09.372 --> 24:13.307
But he was a very big man in India and a very big person

24:13.427 --> 24:17.676
but such a simple man! Such a simple person.

24:19.240 --> 24:23.589
So that’s the significance of well-being.

24:23.709 --> 24:28.364
So when a Sahaja Yogi becomes well-being, gets well-being

24:29.594 --> 24:34.338
then he has all these qualities in him that,

24:34.567 --> 24:39.685
he doesn’t impress on others that he has a property

24:39.805 --> 24:43.608
or he has got money and he should pressurise others.

24:43.728 --> 24:49.149
If he’s really a good Sahaja Yogi he would be the humblest of all

24:49.577 --> 24:53.486
and he would be very generous because in Her hand,

24:53.606 --> 24:55.688
one hand is like this.

24:56.093 --> 24:59.361
The left hand is like this, means She’s generous, She’s giving.

24:59.481 --> 25:02.265
All the time She’s giving. She’s not taking anything,

25:02.385 --> 25:07.252
She’s giving. And that’s how such a person is all the time giving.

25:07.372 --> 25:12.862
I have seen people who, after Sahaja Yoga,

25:13.012 --> 25:18.982
receive a lot of blessings and are miserly or try to oppress others,

25:19.102 --> 25:21.715
lose their properties and lose their money

25:21.835 --> 25:24.370
and really suffer a little bit.

25:24.490 --> 25:28.199
Because otherwise there’s no way of teaching them.

25:29.690 --> 25:33.154
So the generosity flows from Her hand

25:33.274 --> 25:35.672
and another hand is like this,

25:35.792 --> 25:42.976
which means that She gives protection to people.

25:45.023 --> 25:49.933
There have to be some people who are ashritas, are dependents,

25:50.053 --> 25:54.376
who just depend, from whom such a person doesn’t take any money,

25:54.496 --> 26:00.284
they just live. These systems are still in India.

26:00.404 --> 26:05.641
Those people who are well off always have about two, three people

26:05.761 --> 26:10.407
being supported by them. Is a system still working in India,

26:10.527 --> 26:14.365
in many places. I mean, in my father’s house we always remember

26:14.485 --> 26:16.097
we had people like that.

26:16.217 --> 26:19.807
They were educated and given higher education by my father free,

26:19.927 --> 26:24.278
just free. But never did they feel that they were anybody else,

26:24.398 --> 26:28.855
treated with same respect and with same dignity as we were treated.

26:28.975 --> 26:32.939
But that was a part of life, one had to do it.

26:33.407 --> 26:34.909
This is the ashraya,

26:35.029 --> 26:38.033
is that there should be some people depending on you.

26:38.153 --> 26:41.576
England also I’ve seen people have cats, dogs, things like that, you see,

26:41.696 --> 26:45.475
little bit they do spend on cats and dogs.

26:47.118 --> 26:49.063
But better to spend on human beings.

26:49.184 --> 26:51.183
What am I going to do with cats and dogs?

26:51.304 --> 26:53.529
Can I give them realization? (laughter)

26:56.558 --> 26:58.897
It’s better to look after human beings

26:59.017 --> 27:01.667
than to look after cats and dogs so much!

27:01.788 --> 27:04.665
But I have seen that when they are dealing with cats and dogs

27:04.786 --> 27:06.008
they are very happy people,

27:06.128 --> 27:09.189
but with human beings they are very unhappy, I don’t know why.

27:09.309 --> 27:11.664
If you must have seen in the BBC and all that,

27:11.784 --> 27:15.119
when they have these advertisements I have seen in television sometimes,

27:15.239 --> 27:19.742
you see a person having a cat, she’ll always smile and joke and this.

27:19.862 --> 27:24.067
And anybody having children, she looks so miserable! (laughter)

27:28.448 --> 27:33.611
That should not be so. There should be somebody dependent.

27:33.976 --> 27:38.692
It’s not important to measure every money, to ask for 2p (£0.02)

27:38.812 --> 27:42.723
– “I gave you yesterday, will you return 2p to me?”

27:42.843 --> 27:46.793
It doesn’t behove a Sahaja Yogi to be like that.

27:47.349 --> 27:52.128
If it comes to that, alright, give some money – forget about it.

27:52.248 --> 27:55.687
It helps you such a lot, it helps you such a lot.

27:55.807 --> 28:01.106
To be meticulously so observant about how much money you lent

28:01.311 --> 28:05.292
it’s better to be more worried about how much you have taken

28:05.412 --> 28:09.407
than to be how much you have given. It helps a lot.

28:09.979 --> 28:14.851
It’s a thing one has to realize in life, how much it helps.

28:15.867 --> 28:21.191
I have seen in my own life it has helped so many times.

28:21.824 --> 28:26.290
I mean you really have people then, around you.

28:26.481 --> 28:29.784
It’s a matter of 5 Rupees and 10 Rupees.

28:29.904 --> 28:33.864
It’s so important then to some people at a [certain] point,

28:33.984 --> 28:36.733
and it works wonders!

28:37.978 --> 28:45.252
I mean, you can have a human worth millions by paying sometimes 5 Rupees,

28:45.372 --> 28:48.950
it can work out that way. So try to be more giving

28:49.070 --> 28:51.485
and then you receive more as a Sahaja Yogi.

28:51.605 --> 28:56.647
Remember that now you are connected with Lakshmi.

28:57.727 --> 29:01.271
The more generous you are the more you get it.

29:01.391 --> 29:06.060
When you are small-minded you do no receive Her blessings.

29:06.180 --> 29:09.185
You have to give, you have to give.

29:09.305 --> 29:14.147
Once you give, it starts flowing, the stagnation is over

29:14.267 --> 29:16.200
and the flow starts coming in.

29:16.320 --> 29:19.219
Otherwise you are stagnated when your hand is, you see,

29:19.339 --> 29:21.880
tight fisted as you call it.

29:22.126 --> 29:25.774
English language has so many good words,

29:26.013 --> 29:29.316
though they are now losing their meaning!

29:29.436 --> 29:34.378
They call it you are very, I don’t know there must be some new words

29:34.498 --> 29:37.230
for being very, very miserly, some good word, you know,

29:37.350 --> 29:41.043
which doesn’t mean miserly but must be some ‘economical’

29:41.163 --> 29:47.238
or something fantastic. But actually miserliness, is miserliness,

29:47.358 --> 29:50.354
give it whatever name you like, it’s horrible.

29:50.474 --> 29:53.341
And one should not take to miserliness,

29:53.461 --> 29:56.981
that is a curse I tell you, it’s a disease,

29:57.101 --> 30:05.100
it’s like leprosy, to be hated. Try to be generous.

30:06.395 --> 30:14.379
Now the generosity of maybe, I don’t know, but maybe of money,

30:14.681 --> 30:17.176
is not difficult for some people.

30:17.296 --> 30:22.585
But generosity of saying something good to others is rare.

30:24.334 --> 30:27.415
You see somebody in a good dress,

30:27.535 --> 30:29.379
you should be generous enough to say,

30:29.499 --> 30:33.993
“Oh, it’s fantastic, it’s beautiful.” What’s wrong?

30:34.113 --> 30:40.074
But jealousy, that goes against Lakshmi completely.

30:40.661 --> 30:42.730
It’s better that others are wearing it;

30:42.850 --> 30:46.434
you don’t pay for it and you enjoy it! (laughter)

30:46.826 --> 30:50.833
It’s very logical you just see.

30:51.053 --> 30:55.631
You see, if you own this hall, it will be a headache for you isn’t it,

30:55.751 --> 30:59.135
to keep it alright. I mean imagine the people who own it,

30:59.255 --> 31:02.106
and to put it right because everybody will come and criticise,

31:02.226 --> 31:03.951
“This is not good, that’s not good.”

31:04.072 --> 31:08.684
But it’s nice to be here, when it doesn’t belong to you, to enjoy it.

31:09.637 --> 31:14.469
It’s very simple. Just try to enjoy it, to be generous with people,

31:14.589 --> 31:20.028
be kind to them. This generosity is lacking.

31:20.671 --> 31:26.431
When this starts, then the inner core of emotional being starts

31:26.551 --> 31:28.506
getting enlightened.

31:28.705 --> 31:33.558
Go to the subtler side of material well-being

31:33.678 --> 31:37.447
and you start getting into emotional thing.

31:38.249 --> 31:42.865
Small, small things work out, very small.

31:44.121 --> 31:46.040
It’s very sweet.

31:47.532 --> 31:53.052
We have so many examples of this kind of little sweetness

31:53.964 --> 31:56.036
being expressed.

31:57.813 --> 32:03.203
And this generosity should come to all the Sahaja Yogis,

32:04.513 --> 32:06.071
of saying good things to others.

32:06.191 --> 32:10.369
Doesn’t matter [that] it is exaggeration, doesn’t matter,

32:12.415 --> 32:16.340
because it acts as a buffer.

32:17.140 --> 32:19.686
Then the fright of the strangers,

32:19.806 --> 32:23.947
fright of the neighbours, fright of other human beings, you know.

32:24.067 --> 32:26.476
Every human being has become now [that] he sees

32:26.596 --> 32:29.664
another human being coming, he recoils back. Imagine!

32:29.784 --> 32:33.141
First, I mean, say about fifty years back it was like dogs;

32:33.261 --> 32:36.881
if any human being saw another human being they used to bark!

32:37.001 --> 32:43.181
Now it is another way round. So, the fear of your brother,

32:43.301 --> 32:49.171
of your own kin and kith, of your part and parcel.

32:49.733 --> 32:53.571
They are your own, you don’t know, they are part and parcel of your being,

32:53.691 --> 32:56.267
you can feel it, after Sahaja Yoga you can feel it,

32:56.387 --> 32:58.244
I don’t have to tell you.

32:58.943 --> 33:03.376
You can feel them within yourself, they are within you.

33:03.812 --> 33:10.002
And then the sweetness of saying something sweet,

33:11.391 --> 33:17.930
of saying something sweet, is so nice,

33:18.050 --> 33:23.859
is so rewarding, itself, itself, so rewarding.

33:24.073 --> 33:28.397
The movement of Shakti is always this way.

33:28.667 --> 33:32.018
If I give you love, love comes back to me.

33:32.138 --> 33:35.426
If I give you hatred, hatred comes back to me.

33:35.546 --> 33:40.598
And double fold everything. If I give you love,

33:40.718 --> 33:43.745
say 1 unit, I may get 7 units of love.

33:43.865 --> 33:47.568
But if I give you hatred of 1, that too,

33:47.688 --> 33:50.401
7 units of hatred comes to you.

33:50.521 --> 33:53.390
The mathematics is complete.

33:53.953 --> 33:58.890
So try to understand that, emotionally,

33:59.516 --> 34:03.289
you have to understand your material well-being.

34:03.409 --> 34:08.215
How to express emotionally your material well-being

34:08.335 --> 34:10.441
is a very sweet thing.

34:12.123 --> 34:14.302
I would give you an example of Gavin

34:14.422 --> 34:18.417
because I can’t forget that very sweet incident:

34:19.020 --> 34:23.484
One day we had called some people, you see,

34:23.604 --> 34:26.331
I didn’t know there would be so many coming, in his house.

34:26.451 --> 34:30.376
And he has a house but, I mean, not so big like this.

34:30.496 --> 34:33.553
So there were about fifty people, around. And I told him,

34:33.673 --> 34:37.602
“Prepare some food for them.” But I thought for fifty people

34:37.722 --> 34:40.489
he could not have prepared, at the most for ten people!

34:40.609 --> 34:44.132
So I was quite embarrassed  and I was waiting for people to go away,

34:44.253 --> 34:47.345
I didn’t say, “Stay on for dinner,” or anything, I thought,

34:47.466 --> 34:50.682
“Poor Gavin, how could he have cooked for fifty people?”

34:50.803 --> 34:53.723
And when they disappeared, about five, six were remained.

34:53.844 --> 34:57.055
I said, “Now let’s have dinner!” He was very unhappy

34:57.176 --> 34:59.888
and he was looking this side and that side,

35:00.008 --> 35:02.496
I said, “What happened?” But he didn’t say anything.

35:02.616 --> 35:05.562
So I slept that night in his house. Next morning I got up –

35:05.682 --> 35:09.573
still he was very uneasy. Next day I said,

35:09.693 --> 35:11.957
“What’s the matter? What’s playing on your mind?”

35:12.077 --> 35:14.666
He said, “Mother why did you ask all of them to go away?

35:14.787 --> 35:16.841
I had prepared [dinner] for fifty of them?”

35:16.962 --> 35:19.631
This filled me with such joy you can’t imagine!

35:19.752 --> 35:21.735
Tremendous joy,

35:24.613 --> 35:25.794
tremendous joy.

35:25.914 --> 35:29.223
I mean, that I cannot get over such things you know.

35:29.344 --> 35:31.920
And I have just seen so many Sahaja Yogis like that,

35:32.041 --> 35:34.356
very very sweet persons. Another is Gregoire,

35:34.476 --> 35:39.575
another very sweetie person, you know, the way he does things for others.

35:40.456 --> 35:44.945
Sometimes the way he works it out is so sweet,

35:45.715 --> 35:51.613
and how he really knows how to express himself sweetly

35:51.733 --> 35:53.783
in small, little things.

35:54.838 --> 36:01.500
It’s so surprising, how people are very beautiful

36:01.620 --> 36:07.083
and how they are working out these material things

36:07.203 --> 36:09.544
to express their emotions.

36:09.664 --> 36:12.930
Material is for emotions only, you see.

36:13.050 --> 36:16.385
My mother had a principal that, if she had six sarees,

36:16.505 --> 36:18.569
the seventh one she’ll present out.

36:18.689 --> 36:22.438
She had kept six; not more [are] needed, you see.

36:22.558 --> 36:25.124
And she was a woman of great principle, I must say,

36:25.244 --> 36:29.318
because she used to spin her own sarees. Can you imagine!

36:30.064 --> 36:32.894
And that’s what she used to wear, herself.

36:33.014 --> 36:35.155
And she was a wife of a very rich man, I mean,

36:35.275 --> 36:37.964
she had no problem of money but this was her principle,

36:38.085 --> 36:40.578
she used to live like that. And she said that,

36:40.698 --> 36:43.786
“What? I need six, more than [that] I don’t need,”

36:43.906 --> 36:46.598
because it’s cotton sarees, you see, so

36:46.718 --> 36:50.194
one saree you wash and next you wear and you can just press it.

36:50.315 --> 36:53.145
We had people in the house who could do that for her.

36:53.265 --> 36:55.626
She said, “There’s no need to have more than six.”

36:55.746 --> 36:58.826
And one she would keep for some occasion, you see, expensive one,

36:58.946 --> 37:01.748
if she has to go for a wedding and all that, that’s all.

37:01.868 --> 37:05.104
So the seventh was kept (to give away) and out of the six,

37:05.224 --> 37:07.995
if she got one more she would donate that to somebody.

37:08.115 --> 37:12.833
She would only keep up to six you see, that was her principle,

37:12.953 --> 37:17.089
and she managed her life very well.

37:17.209 --> 37:24.043
And I was also bit too much of a generous person

37:24.217 --> 37:29.330
and she always supported my generosity, always she supported it.

37:29.450 --> 37:32.719
And she was very happy when she found that I would just give away

37:32.840 --> 37:35.834
lots of things to people who came to my house and she would say,

37:35.955 --> 37:38.011
“Oh that’s very good, she should do that.”

37:38.132 --> 37:40.331
Everybody used to say that, “That should be done”.

37:40.451 --> 37:43.118
Always used to encourage me for such things that I did.

37:43.238 --> 37:45.470
But I found [that] all things have only value

37:45.590 --> 37:49.037
if I can give them away otherwise they have no value.

37:49.157 --> 37:52.066
And I keep only the things that are being presented to me

37:52.186 --> 37:55.530
all the rest pass out of my hands very easily into people.

37:55.651 --> 37:58.433
Anybody who says, “I like this,” “Alright, have it!”

37:58.554 --> 38:01.839
You see, I feel so happy to give it to them and it’s really rewarding.

38:01.960 --> 38:04.442
Now that person thinks, “What should I give you back?”

38:04.563 --> 38:06.527
I said, “Now please! That’s not to be done

38:06.648 --> 38:09.425
because you know already, come and see, this house is filled

38:09.546 --> 38:12.177
with things, and I don’t know how to get rid of them.”

38:12.298 --> 38:16.036
If I buy anything myself, of course I don’t earn anything

38:16.156 --> 38:21.938
so it’s from my husband’s money, I try to give it away.

38:22.224 --> 38:25.341
It’s very nice, it’s really extremely nice.

38:25.461 --> 38:28.014
After all what’s the use of these things in the house?

38:28.135 --> 38:30.274
What are you going to do [with them]?

38:31.035 --> 38:34.438
I mean, if you have to have a personal archives, you can have!

38:34.558 --> 38:37.643
You see, something like that, putting up this thing bought there,

38:37.764 --> 38:41.579
this thing bought there. But normally what do you do?

38:42.237 --> 38:46.720
So this kind of a generosity is to be developed within us.

38:46.840 --> 38:55.013
The aesthetics of generosity is to be seen.

38:55.728 --> 39:01.036
How you give things to others and how you express your emotional being.

39:01.156 --> 39:06.114
For people who are emotionally dry because of ego orientation,

39:06.234 --> 39:10.331
should learn these things, is very important.

39:10.451 --> 39:14.524
That will give them some emotional side also.

39:14.644 --> 39:17.316
[It’s] very much necessary for people

39:17.436 --> 39:21.887
who do not feel their feelings much, their joy much;

39:22.007 --> 39:26.665
they should try to do it [then] they will start feeling it much more.

39:26.785 --> 39:30.900
Then the emotional side is enlightened within us,

39:33.178 --> 39:37.002
the Grace starts flowing up to emotional side.

39:37.978 --> 39:42.276
In emotional side, first of all the purification takes place.

39:42.396 --> 39:44.389
That’s very important.

39:44.556 --> 39:47.139
To lead a very beautiful emotional life

39:47.259 --> 39:50.315
you must have pure ideas,

39:50.664 --> 39:54.098
otherwise you can never be emotionally alright.

39:54.218 --> 39:56.889
You see, like in a tree you have to have leaves

39:57.009 --> 40:00.352
you have to have roots, you have to have fruits,

40:00.472 --> 40:04.187
you have to have flowers at it’s proper places.

40:04.307 --> 40:07.382
Like in your house you have to have a drawing room,

40:07.502 --> 40:10.924
you have to have a bedroom, you have to have a bathroom;

40:11.044 --> 40:15.331
everything separated. You do not put them into a complete,

40:15.451 --> 40:21.226
what do you call that? A mixer.

40:21.361 --> 40:23.866
You do not make it like that, isn’t it?

40:23.986 --> 40:27.123
You don’t put your bathroom in the drawing rooms do you?

40:27.243 --> 40:30.217
I mean some people may start it with the kind of confusion

40:30.337 --> 40:33.590
they have these days! But normally you do not do it.

40:33.710 --> 40:40.709
In our own emotional life we must have pure sense.

40:40.851 --> 40:46.948
Purity of a sisterly love, purity of a brotherly love,

40:47.298 --> 40:49.062
purity of a wife’s love.

40:49.182 --> 40:54.748
For example infidelity: infidelity is impurity,

40:54.868 --> 40:58.413
infidelity comes when there is impurity.

40:58.635 --> 41:02.137
Without fidelity the marriage life cannot be happy.

41:02.257 --> 41:04.212
That’s the basis of married life.

41:04.332 --> 41:09.630
You see, “I like…”  this “I like” business is impurity.

41:09.750 --> 41:13.078
The impurity in you likes it.

41:13.760 --> 41:16.587
Gradually, after realisation, you start developing

41:16.707 --> 41:19.039
that purity within you;

41:20.547 --> 41:25.155
you start understanding these are your brothers and sisters.

41:26.179 --> 41:30.137
As soon as your emotional life starts improving

41:30.796 --> 41:33.139
your innocence starts awakening up.

41:33.259 --> 41:37.190
You see? It is connected with your innocence.

41:37.310 --> 41:41.022
The left side is connected with your innocence.

41:41.299 --> 41:47.042
And then it starts flowering and you really become innocent.

41:47.216 --> 41:51.751
Now see the practical side: you go to somebody’s house,

41:51.871 --> 41:55.892
the gentleman has a beautiful wife, now your bad eyes on the wife,

41:56.012 --> 41:59.651
how can you enjoy? You cannot enjoy, the husband cannot enjoy,

41:59.771 --> 42:03.478
the wife cannot enjoy, all the time there’s a fear.

42:03.598 --> 42:07.000
Maybe the wife may run away with you or something may happen:

42:07.120 --> 42:10.574
the whole house will be finished, I mean, you are so destructive!

42:10.694 --> 42:13.982
So-called ‘charming’ men and ‘charming’ women

42:14.102 --> 42:16.078
are just destroying each others lives.

42:16.198 --> 42:19.706
Where do they land? All in the orphanages!

42:19.826 --> 42:23.284
A woman marries seven times, a husband marries eight times.

42:23.404 --> 42:25.920
All these old people are in the orphanage

42:26.040 --> 42:28.301
and children are in another orphanage.

42:28.421 --> 42:32.154
You see, you are just creating orphanages by this kind of impurity

42:32.274 --> 42:35.156
in your mind. But by telling you, these things,

42:35.276 --> 42:38.691
you are not going to believe me, nor you can do it,

42:38.811 --> 42:41.402
but just when it happens.

42:41.759 --> 42:46.946
When this happens, the innocence, the joy of pure love,

42:47.066 --> 42:53.510
when there is no other impurity but just pure love

42:53.630 --> 42:56.954
for brothers, sisters. I mean, here,

42:57.074 --> 43:02.456
I have seen people don’t even sort of embrace each other– men.

43:02.576 --> 43:04.371
It’s most surprising,

43:04.491 --> 43:07.685
I mean, for us it’s something one can’t understand.

43:07.805 --> 43:10.790
So much impurity has gone into our brain that every man,

43:10.910 --> 43:12.338
is he that way wrong?

43:12.459 --> 43:14.991
When we came here my husband used to embrace every man;

43:15.112 --> 43:17.479
I told him, “Don’t do it, people will laugh at you!”

43:17.600 --> 43:18.718
He said, “Really?”

43:18.838 --> 43:21.565
He said, “But everyone is not like that, maybe one person.”

43:21.685 --> 43:24.234
I said, “No, they think everybody is like that.”

43:24.354 --> 43:27.143
You see, whatever they found pathological in one person,

43:27.263 --> 43:29.118
they think everybody is like that.

43:29.238 --> 43:34.832
These psychologists, whatever they read in one abnormal person,

43:34.952 --> 43:38.295
they try to see in everyone! Everybody is not like that!

43:38.415 --> 43:42.007
I mean there is no harm in understanding

43:42.127 --> 43:46.048
that there is only 1% people are pathological

43:46.168 --> 43:48.972
-who go to these psychologists!

43:49.092 --> 43:52.486
The others who are spoilt are because of psychologists themselves!

43:52.606 --> 43:55.710
They put ideas, “You have a guilt, you have a guilt, you have a guilt.”

43:55.831 --> 43:58.889
Even if you don’t have, you will have it! (laughter)

44:00.508 --> 44:03.480
They go on putting ideas into your heads.

44:03.600 --> 44:06.222
All this is supposed to be intellectual expansion,

44:06.342 --> 44:08.747
whatever you may call it, it’s all nonsense you see.

44:08.867 --> 44:10.924
A person who doesn’t commit sin you say,

44:11.045 --> 44:12.567
“Oh, he must have committed sin,”

44:12.688 --> 44:14.718
now he doesn’t know what to do he’ll come and say,

44:14.839 --> 44:17.105
“Alright baba, I have committed sin, now I have to confess.

44:17.226 --> 44:19.241
So I have to confess, yes I have committed sin.”

44:19.361 --> 44:21.267
They play about like this.

44:21.387 --> 44:23.410
They just try to build you up and all that

44:23.531 --> 44:26.497
and then they break you, shatter you completely and then you think,

44:26.618 --> 44:30.435
“Oh I am the most sinful person [who] ever lived!”

44:32.300 --> 44:33.669
If you were that sinful,

44:33.789 --> 44:37.448
do you think you will get realisation first of all?

44:40.259 --> 44:44.632
First ask yourself the question, “How did I get realisation?

44:44.752 --> 44:46.477
How did I feel vibrations?

44:46.597 --> 44:49.782
If I was that sinful, how could I get it?”

44:50.378 --> 44:53.044
Throw away all these ideas of these psychologists

44:53.164 --> 44:55.324
and tell them that we don’t believe you!

44:55.444 --> 44:59.519
You see, this is very few people who are really basically sinful.

44:59.639 --> 45:04.792
I tell you, very, very rarely, I have not seen anyone so far,

45:04.912 --> 45:07.545
except for these horrible gurus who are well known!

45:07.665 --> 45:10.697
After all they are the people who are rakshasas,

45:10.817 --> 45:14.296
they are not human beings, you see, so that’s a different category.

45:14.416 --> 45:17.062
But, otherwise, I have not seen basically a person

45:17.182 --> 45:22.788
who has nothing good in him. Because everybody has the Spirit.

45:23.185 --> 45:26.635
And definitely Spirit is superior much more dynamic

45:26.755 --> 45:28.358
than all the sins put together.

45:28.479 --> 45:32.605
What are these little, little sins here and there? What are you doing?

45:32.725 --> 45:35.427
And there’s nothing to feel so diffident about it.

45:35.547 --> 45:38.970
After all you are realised people, you are saints.

45:39.090 --> 45:41.403
You are to be respected.

45:42.150 --> 45:45.543
You have to respect yourself first of all.

45:45.884 --> 45:49.364
You are all saints, do you realise that?

45:49.872 --> 45:53.797
Once you realise you are saints you will start acting as saints,

45:53.917 --> 45:55.893
how the saints act.

45:56.687 --> 45:59.433
You will put yourself onto that pedestal of understanding

45:59.554 --> 46:02.493
that you are really saints, otherwise you won’t get vibrations.

46:02.614 --> 46:04.200
Go and ask anyone of these!

46:04.321 --> 46:08.458
They will tell you: the vibrations, only people who are saints get it.

46:08.579 --> 46:13.234
In India all the people are burnt when they die;

46:13.354 --> 46:16.847
not the saints, realised souls are not,

46:19.413 --> 46:21.424
they are respected.

46:21.948 --> 46:23.998
They say when the saints come to your house,

46:24.118 --> 46:27.479
that’s the day, is the day of festival.

46:28.932 --> 46:36.067
And all of you are that so don’t think that you cannot do this,

46:36.187 --> 46:38.697
and you have this guilt and you have these things –

46:38.817 --> 46:42.347
nothing of the kind! You are pure Spirit.

46:44.519 --> 46:47.649
Be very lavish about it!

46:48.641 --> 46:54.611
Of course, I mean, too much indulgences into these things,

46:54.889 --> 47:00.129
emotional life also, can lead you to a stagnation point.

47:00.249 --> 47:05.598
Like I hear people saying that, “There’s a lot of love between us.”

47:06.908 --> 47:11.070
But one has to be discreet in that also:

47:11.190 --> 47:17.076
does it make you universal or it makes you localised?

47:17.196 --> 47:22.487
You see, like Britishers for British, Indians for Indians, finished!

47:23.019 --> 47:29.097
If that love makes you universal, by which you say kindly things,

47:32.121 --> 47:39.213
by which you enjoy the love of other people, their vibrations.

47:39.333 --> 47:44.513
Whatever creed, race, it is, whatever part of the world they come from,

47:44.633 --> 47:47.287
they are Sahaja Yogis; if you start enjoying them,

47:47.407 --> 47:51.090
then know that that is love.

47:51.756 --> 47:55.037
It should not be localised in any way.

47:55.411 --> 48:00.942
If there is any group forming, then must know that it is not love,

48:01.062 --> 48:05.840
it’s not Divinity, it’s not.

48:05.960 --> 48:12.239
Divinity is universal, it embraces everything, everything.

48:12.359 --> 48:16.177
It has no discrimination of any kind.

48:16.297 --> 48:21.781
It only discriminates between evil and good,

48:22.130 --> 48:25.678
unrighteous and righteous,

48:25.798 --> 48:29.288
Christ and anti-Christ,

48:29.408 --> 48:32.408
God and anti-God

48:33.900 --> 48:37.760
but it does not discriminate on these three levels

48:37.880 --> 48:44.915
that is physical appearances, mental approach

48:45.035 --> 48:50.198
or mental development or emotional expressions.

48:50.318 --> 48:52.569
Some people are emotionally very expressive.

48:52.689 --> 48:56.715
I would say English are less expressive by temperament maybe,

48:56.835 --> 49:00.461
that’s their temperament. Indians are extremely expressive.

49:00.582 --> 49:02.437
If you go to India, to a village, say,

49:02.557 --> 49:06.163
you go to Rahuri (Maharashtra), they will just take you

49:06.306 --> 49:11.581
in their embrace and would start weeping and crying with joy.

49:11.701 --> 49:15.214
I mean, you will be amazed the way they will love you, I mean, imagine!

49:15.335 --> 49:19.923
And for them it would be like, they wouldn’t mind

49:20.043 --> 49:23.855
even if they have to spread themselves on the ground

49:23.975 --> 49:26.913
for you to walk smoothly

49:27.033 --> 49:32.879
so that you don’t feel the horrible roads of India.

49:32.999 --> 49:35.097
That kind of tremendous emotions,

49:35.217 --> 49:38.179
the expression you will be surprised.

49:38.299 --> 49:40.494
You will be overwhelmed and sometimes shocked,

49:40.615 --> 49:42.670
you know, the way they are.

49:44.582 --> 49:47.200
But that doesn’t mean that English don’t love.

49:47.320 --> 49:51.966
They love in their own way; they understand that.

49:53.283 --> 49:56.640
So that’s how it should be that it is all embracing,

49:56.760 --> 50:01.079
all shades, all types, all permutations, combinations.

50:01.199 --> 50:05.241
Because this variety is created by God to create beauty

50:05.361 --> 50:07.165
and all the varieties must be accepted.

50:07.285 --> 50:09.721
Imagine you all looking just the same,

50:09.841 --> 50:14.130
how would it look? Horrible and boring!

50:14.336 --> 50:18.240
Every leaf is different, then what about human beings?

50:18.360 --> 50:21.352
But in that difference there’s the unity of Spirit

50:21.472 --> 50:23.760
and if you can feel that unity

50:23.880 --> 50:29.702
then you are emotionally absolutely correct and you are a realised soul.

50:31.472 --> 50:36.688
And, last of all, the most important, is your Spirit,

50:37.140 --> 50:40.881
Spirit that resides in your heart.

50:41.270 --> 50:47.418
All this beauty is only perceived when there is light in your Spirit

50:47.538 --> 50:52.099
otherwise you cannot see all this beauty, you cannot enjoy it.

50:52.550 --> 50:59.700
Spirit is the one which is the diamond

51:01.256 --> 51:04.789
which shines on this beautiful ring of your body,

51:04.909 --> 51:10.625
mind and your emotions. That’s the most important thing.

51:10.745 --> 51:18.388
That is to be achieved, to be absolutely absorbed into your being.

51:19.425 --> 51:23.547
That state should be achieved by all of you.

51:23.667 --> 51:28.357
But the growth, if the outside is not alright,

51:28.477 --> 51:35.278
then the inside cannot be carried by that weak outside.

51:36.620 --> 51:41.315
It’s such a strong thing spiritual life is a very strong thing;

51:41.435 --> 51:45.192
it’s so dynamic, it’s so powerful.

51:45.938 --> 51:49.748
Sometimes, you know, it floods me completely.

51:49.985 --> 51:52.945
I mean, I have to control myself;

51:53.065 --> 51:56.568
the love just shoots off from the being

51:56.688 --> 52:02.998
and just I want to give it but I wonder

52:03.118 --> 52:06.023
whether you’ll be able to bear it,

52:08.767 --> 52:10.967
so I have to control it a little bit [because]

52:11.087 --> 52:14.072
that flood may not be borne.

52:14.192 --> 52:19.625
So you have to enrich your outside to bear that inside beauty.

52:19.745 --> 52:24.225
And the more you enrich it, the more you make it strong,

52:24.345 --> 52:27.095
the more it will shine.

52:27.254 --> 52:35.032
It’s so simultaneous because one must understand that Spirit is love,

52:36.476 --> 52:40.992
is all intelligence, is all awareness,

52:41.112 --> 52:44.416
and it knows your problem. It slowly shines.

52:44.536 --> 52:49.312
It sees how far you can bear, how far you can go.

52:49.828 --> 52:56.959
Then after realisation, when you start looking after your outside,

52:57.079 --> 53:01.069
the inside starts shining by itself.

53:02.466 --> 53:07.006
But attention should be towards your Spirit.

53:07.506 --> 53:11.977
All these outside qualities are so joy-giving to the Spirit.

53:12.097 --> 53:15.592
You can’t imagine. Try them!

53:16.298 --> 53:17.895
You will enjoy yourself.

53:18.015 --> 53:20.597
We have not been able to enjoy ourselves much.

53:20.717 --> 53:23.148
If we could we would not [even] shun the jails,

53:23.268 --> 53:25.951
I mean I would be happy in a jail I tell you,

53:26.071 --> 53:28.962
because I can enjoy myself there better!

53:29.082 --> 53:32.046
But the one thing is there, you cannot enjoy yourself

53:32.166 --> 53:36.303
so much when you cannot share it with others also isn’t it?

53:36.423 --> 53:41.796
It becomes like that. Without sharing you cannot enjoy yourself.

53:42.398 --> 53:45.554
And that’s what should happen to all the Sahaja Yogis.

53:45.674 --> 53:49.994
At that level you should come. We should be at that level.

53:50.114 --> 53:53.735
Try to keep your level that high, is important.

53:53.855 --> 53:58.960
Sometimes you come down, you start criticising others.

53:59.080 --> 54:01.555
Others are also not right, for example, somebody sees

54:01.675 --> 54:04.112
somebody filthy, dirty, something like that.

54:04.232 --> 54:06.239
The person who’s filthy, dirty, of course

54:06.360 --> 54:08.890
there’s something wrong with that person, no doubt,

54:09.011 --> 54:12.199
but that person should be pitied. At least he should be clean.

54:12.319 --> 54:15.544
I mean, that’s the minimum of minimum.

54:16.345 --> 54:19.057
But instead of that if you start criticising that person,

54:19.178 --> 54:21.018
you also become filthy in your language,

54:21.139 --> 54:24.045
filthy in your mind and everything, so why [do it]? Leave it!

54:24.165 --> 54:25.793
Let that person improve by himself,

54:25.913 --> 54:28.433
to see that he has to be clean, he has to be neat,

54:28.553 --> 54:30.783
he has to be sensible.

54:31.775 --> 54:35.449
This is to be seen by that person himself and not by you.

54:35.569 --> 54:38.164
Where is your attention?

54:39.647 --> 54:42.535
It’s a habit in India, all the parents will ask the children

54:42.656 --> 54:44.938
when they are standing, “Where is your attention?”

54:45.059 --> 54:48.231
“Where is my attention?” alright. Then again he’s standing there,

54:48.352 --> 54:51.274
“Where is your attention?” Again he’ll be on the watch [out],

54:51.394 --> 54:53.150
“Where is my attention gone?”

54:53.270 --> 54:55.654
We have to look after our attention, that’s all.

54:55.774 --> 55:01.476
“Where is my attention? Is it on the Spirit?”

55:01.619 --> 55:05.200
Next time I’ll tell you more about the Spirit part.

55:05.320 --> 55:07.830
I hope you have understood how necessary it is

55:07.950 --> 55:11.944
to develop your inner being.

55:12.539 --> 55:17.983
In your mental being, egoistical nature is to be controlled very much.

55:18.103 --> 55:23.346
I have seen people who go from left to right, they become egoistical.

55:24.020 --> 55:28.891
Those who go from right to left, they become frightened.

55:29.534 --> 55:36.447
All these side movements must be brought to the centre.

55:37.764 --> 55:43.360
You have to understand that from basics we have to rise higher.

55:43.480 --> 55:48.509
People have explanation for everything! No explanation is needed.

55:48.630 --> 55:51.297
Whom are you explaining? You are explaining to yourself,

55:51.417 --> 55:54.975
you are judging yourself. You have to judge yourself,

55:55.095 --> 55:58.462
[to] whom are you explaining? Mataji?

55:58.702 --> 56:01.171
She doesn’t need any explanation.

56:01.291 --> 56:05.189
I know, perhaps, everything, perhaps.

56:05.958 --> 56:07.863
But I don’t condemn you and in any way

56:07.984 --> 56:11.020
I do not want that you should be condemned by any chance at all,

56:11.141 --> 56:13.181
why should I? You are all saints after all.

56:13.302 --> 56:17.069
For me it’s the greatest satisfaction.

56:17.189 --> 56:22.915
But for your own growth I want you to understand

56:23.326 --> 56:25.975
that you are saints and you have to come up to that point.

56:26.095 --> 56:29.220
Saints have to be self-disciplined, nobody has to tell them.

56:29.340 --> 56:31.785
Discipline yourself,

56:33.285 --> 56:36.410
tell yourself, “I am a saint now.”

56:36.530 --> 56:41.406
What an opportunity it is to grow! What an opportunity!

56:41.977 --> 56:44.449
And people are only going to believe in you

56:44.569 --> 56:50.685
when you are really the saint within and saint without.

56:51.167 --> 56:53.832
In Sahaja Yoga, people become saints within

56:53.952 --> 56:55.757
and not saints without easily.

56:55.877 --> 56:58.877
But in other systems they are first made outside, you see,

56:58.997 --> 57:04.301
they are made to work for 25 years just washing the temple – finished!

57:04.880 --> 57:07.713
Then they are made to do something else for 25 years.

57:07.834 --> 57:10.236
By the time they are about to [be] dead they’ll say,

57:10.357 --> 57:14.470
“Alright, next time we’ll give you realisation.”

57:14.591 --> 57:20.428
It’s like that. But here, from inside you have really achieved

57:21.159 --> 57:25.896
your realisation no doubt, and you have greater chances of improving.

57:26.016 --> 57:28.264
This is what I thought, that,

57:28.384 --> 57:31.648
“This lifetime I am just going to give realisation

57:31.768 --> 57:35.295
to all the people who come to me – let’s see.”

57:35.477 --> 57:41.844
And you are going to do full justice to my bold step

57:43.248 --> 57:48.388
because now you’ve got it. It is going to work out much faster.

57:48.508 --> 57:49.721
It has to work out.

57:49.841 --> 57:54.176
This was the only way it could have worked out faster than to make you,

57:54.296 --> 58:00.400
first of all, wash yourself every day, get up at 4 o’clock and make you

58:00.520 --> 58:07.902
like military people . I said, “No, let’s try this way.”

58:08.022 --> 58:12.733
And it’s done, it’s happening, it’s so simple.

58:13.162 --> 58:16.308
Then the self-discipline must start.

58:16.982 --> 58:19.470
And you must try to improve your light,

58:19.590 --> 58:21.369
which is just kindled,

58:21.489 --> 58:27.080
to make it a beautiful light, clean light and generous,

58:27.200 --> 58:31.315
giving light, the light of love.

58:32.053 --> 58:34.377
It will work out I am sure.

58:34.639 --> 58:39.506
Keep your standards high. Do not fall down.

58:40.085 --> 58:43.154
Put your attention into proper gear.

58:43.400 --> 58:48.167
It’s all prophesised, as you know. Blake has prophesised it.

58:48.287 --> 58:51.622
The more I read the book the more I am convinced

58:51.742 --> 58:54.906
that England is going to be the Jerusalem.

58:55.026 --> 59:00.242
Now think of that. No lethargy allowed.

59:01.337 --> 59:06.163
While I find Australians are coming up much faster.

59:07.012 --> 59:11.262
You have to prove Blake’s prophesy.

59:11.382 --> 59:14.892
May God bless you. All of you.

59:17.567 --> 59:20.360
Cooly, can you give me some water please?

59:22.884 --> 59:24.562
Look at the children!!

59:25.689 --> 59:28.631
All quiet! Thank you very much.

59:37.623 --> 59:43.286
If you could arrange a seminar Gavin, anytime,

59:43.406 --> 59:48.072
for three days, I can postpone my going to India.

59:48.192 --> 59:50.610
As I would like to have a seminar sometime.

59:50.730 --> 59:55.168
Gavin: We can get a place in Sussex, from the,

59:55.715 --> 59:58.681
I think it’s the twelfth, no the eleventh, to the thirteenth,

59:58.801 --> 01:00:04.239
that’s a mid-week time. We can have about 45-50 people.

01:00:05.174 --> 01:00:06.623
Shri Mataji: We have many more.

01:00:09.584 --> 01:00:12.415
I would like to have it on a Saturday Sunday somewhere.

01:00:12.535 --> 01:00:13.841
Gavin: We can find somewhere

01:00:13.961 --> 01:00:16.682
but it is difficult to get these places for a weekend.

01:00:16.802 --> 01:00:18.643
We’re still trying.

01:00:19.104 --> 01:00:25.247
Shri Mataji: I think in a, any place, like Brighton or something

01:00:25.367 --> 01:00:30.113
you might get it, or why not hire a boat?

01:00:39.627 --> 01:00:41.364
Isn’t it a good idea?

01:00:41.484 --> 01:00:44.397
Gavin: We can see what we can do.

01:00:46.650 --> 01:00:48.574
Actually I was looking out for a ship.

01:00:48.695 --> 01:00:51.117
If one of the Shipping Corporation ships had arrived,

01:00:51.237 --> 01:00:54.092
I thought we’ll go and stay in a ship, would be a good idea,

01:00:54.213 --> 01:00:57.425
because it always is there for about three four days.

01:00:57.545 --> 01:01:00.745
But there’s no ship arriving in this month

01:01:00.865 --> 01:01:03.590
otherwise, we could have done it.

01:01:04.805 --> 01:01:07.233
Some sort of a boat for two days you can hire,

01:01:07.353 --> 01:01:11.590
a big boat where all of us could be there on a Saturday Sunday.

01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:13.501
We should be there, it’s important.

01:01:13.621 --> 01:01:18.274
Before I leave I would like to fix some certain screws.

01:01:21.606 --> 01:01:25.527
I mean, you can have it on Thames River if you want.

01:01:25.647 --> 01:01:31.612
Or Brighton, do you have boats or things? No? Just find out.

01:01:32.747 --> 01:01:34.392
So that should be resolved

01:01:34.512 --> 01:01:36.721
and then I will arrange my going accordingly.

01:01:36.841 --> 01:01:40.127
If there is any program like that I will postpone it.

01:01:40.247 --> 01:01:43.775
But I would like to know as soon as possible.

01:01:51.847 --> 01:01:56.431
As I have told you before that Sahaja Yoga has no technique;

01:01:56.551 --> 01:02:00.826
it’s a spontaneous happening which takes place.

01:02:02.429 --> 01:02:10.088
Now the flower becomes the fruit, it has no technique,

01:02:10.208 --> 01:02:14.554
but the sun has to come to do the job, you see,

01:02:14.674 --> 01:02:18.446
and that technique is beyond our understanding.

01:02:18.566 --> 01:02:23.507
In the same way it happens – just transformation.

01:02:24.952 --> 01:02:28.545
But later on you must know how to maintain

01:02:28.665 --> 01:02:30.476
and how to keep it up, that’s all.

01:02:30.596 --> 01:02:33.116
Once it is managed it can be worked out.

01:02:33.236 --> 01:02:38.366
Many people have done it, and you should be able to do it also.

01:02:38.842 --> 01:02:42.642
But try not to see others. See yourself first.

01:02:42.762 --> 01:02:47.089
That’s very important. That is a very important part.

01:02:47.209 --> 01:02:48.135
CLERCK

01:02:48.255 --> 01:02:52.012
If you can put your hands towards me, like this just,

01:02:53.662 --> 01:02:57.262
and close your eyes, just close your eyes.

01:03:05.784 --> 01:03:09.950
If your hands are shaking or your body is shaking

01:03:10.070 --> 01:03:14.526
or your eyes are fluttering, I mean the eyelids,

01:03:14.646 --> 01:03:18.331
then you open your eyes and just watch me,

01:03:19.274 --> 01:03:21.935
just watch me on my forehead.

01:03:25.546 --> 01:03:29.774
Have you been to some guru or someone? No one?

01:03:29.894 --> 01:03:32.959
What do you do for your work?

01:03:35.110 --> 01:03:36.382
Seeker: I’m a clerk.

01:03:36.502 --> 01:03:39.195
Shri Mataji: Ah, that’s it.

01:03:39.315 --> 01:03:43.573
Ah, the right side is too much used.

01:03:45.152 --> 01:03:46.925
Should work out. Are

01:03:51.648 --> 01:03:53.404
you shaking also?

01:03:54.022 --> 01:03:57.709
No? You are getting cool breeze? It’s great.

01:03:58.224 --> 01:04:05.596
Are you getting? Not yet. None of the fingers? Which one?

01:04:05.747 --> 01:04:11.479
Did you go to any guru or anyone? Did you to anyone? Guru or anyone?

01:04:11.599 --> 01:04:16.523
To spiritualist or anyone? No?

01:04:22.521 --> 01:04:26.152
Are you getting cool breeze? Good.

01:04:29.084 --> 01:04:34.709
Put both the feet straight. Relax. You are getting? Good.

01:04:34.829 --> 01:04:37.896
Close your eyes and enjoy your Self.

01:04:42.296 --> 01:04:45.177
Better now. Just do it like that, you see.

01:04:45.297 --> 01:04:47.638
It’s more on the right side, is a problem.

01:04:47.758 --> 01:04:50.956
It’s because too much thinking, thinking, you know.

01:04:51.076 --> 01:04:56.962
So the imbalance of…too much thinking also gives an imbalance, you see.

01:04:57.082 --> 01:04:59.806
All the time you’re thinking, thinking, thinking.

01:04:59.926 --> 01:05:03.755
That gives you a trouble. It should work out.

01:05:03.875 --> 01:05:08.908
See, put your left hand on the stomach, the centre, yes.

01:05:09.028 --> 01:05:13.562
Put your right hand now towards me, like this.

01:05:13.682 --> 01:05:16.554
Now the shaking will be less.

01:05:18.795 --> 01:05:21.837
Put it there so you will be comfortable.

01:05:21.957 --> 01:05:24.651
It will reduce gradually.

01:05:24.771 --> 01:05:25.484
1’05’30

01:05:25.635 --> 01:05:30.543
You See? This is nothing but there’s nervousness inside,

01:05:30.663 --> 01:05:32.061
which has to go out.

01:05:32.181 --> 01:05:37.253
You see the nerves have been too much tortured by thinking.

01:05:40.173 --> 01:05:43.505
Now it’s better, soothing down.

01:05:44.862 --> 01:05:46.388
Much better, see?

01:05:46.508 --> 01:05:48.524
It will soothe down.

01:05:48.644 --> 01:05:49.293
END CLERCK

01:05:49.413 --> 01:05:52.625
Anne, there are some new people I see on the left hand side.

01:05:52.745 --> 01:05:55.541
Just see them, if they are realised, all of them.

01:05:55.661 --> 01:06:00.259
Just see some of these people who are there.

01:06:02.178 --> 01:06:07.560
Yah, just see. Have you got cool breeze there?

01:06:07.869 --> 01:06:10.993
Have you got cool breeze in the hand?

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:17.669
What did you say? You have got it?

01:06:17.789 --> 01:06:19.692
Seeker: YesShri Mataji: Good. Good.

01:06:19.812 --> 01:06:22.225
They are from Brighton are they?

01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:26.191
Have you come from Brighton? No. Good.

01:06:26.311 --> 01:06:32.385
Jason, just see if they are getting cool breeze on the head also.

01:06:33.422 --> 01:06:36.480
This side, are there new people?

01:06:38.996 --> 01:06:41.042
You got the cool breeze?

01:06:41.162 --> 01:06:42.072
Seeker: Not sure

01:06:42.192 --> 01:06:45.949
Shri Mataji: All right, it comes so much that you’ll get sure of it,

01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:51.263
all right? Just work it out.

01:06:54.608 --> 01:06:56.309
You can work out.

01:07:00.059 --> 01:07:01.664
There also.

01:07:01.784 --> 01:07:07.028
Peter, in front of you there, just see, someone.

01:07:08.798 --> 01:07:11.127
Behind is there someone sitting?

01:07:11.247 --> 01:07:14.102
He’s come for the first time?

01:07:17.285 --> 01:07:20.844
How are you, Anna? Better?

01:07:23.887 --> 01:07:26.382
She’s got it.

01:07:30.547 --> 01:07:33.516
Better now? It’s better.

01:07:33.636 --> 01:07:36.971
Still there? Less, but much less.

01:07:37.091 --> 01:07:41.064
Just do it like that.
Just throw it away. Throw it away.

01:07:41.184 --> 01:07:45.154
It has to go out. Now, let’s see.

01:07:47.895 --> 01:07:49.730
Just imagine.

01:07:49.850 --> 01:07:53.202
Throw it away again, it’s horrible.

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:58.126
Who’s there?
Left to the right, you just put him,

01:07:58.246 --> 01:08:00.877
left to the right for him. Come along. Good.

01:08:00.997 --> 01:08:06.708
Put it left to the right yes.
They will do it. You put your right hand, yes.

01:08:09.116 --> 01:08:13.820
Are you better now? Are you feeling any cool breeze?

01:08:21.819 --> 01:08:24.288
How many years you have worked as a clerk?

01:08:24.408 --> 01:08:25.526
Clerk: Twelve.

01:08:31.962 --> 01:08:37.213
Shri Mataji: Look after his Vishuddhi
and centre heart. He’ll be all right.

01:08:37.396 --> 01:08:40.449
Yah! Vishuddhi and centre heart.

01:08:44.571 --> 01:08:47.979
Terrific, they are terrific people.

01:08:51.484 --> 01:08:54.328
All right, is she all right?

01:08:54.510 --> 01:08:58.417
What? Put your left hand here.

01:08:58.537 --> 01:09:01.589
All right? A little bit and put both the feet straight

01:09:01.709 --> 01:09:05.888
like that on the ground would be better. Like this,

01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:08.065
both the feet. Yes, let’s see.

01:09:08.185 --> 01:09:11.826
She’s all right, I think, she’s got it.

01:09:14.659 --> 01:09:20.902
She’s all right. What about this gentleman? Left to the right.

01:09:22.731 --> 01:09:25.687
It’s nice you came to see me.

01:09:26.663 --> 01:09:30.297
Really, because anything could have happened, you know,

01:09:30.417 --> 01:09:34.816
with this kind of a tremendous pressure on your mind.

01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:38.660
It’s still there. It will be.

01:09:41.663 --> 01:09:45.209
That’s how people get all these troubles, like diabetes, you see.

01:09:45.329 --> 01:09:48.957
Then even if they don’t listen to that then they could get heart.

01:09:49.077 --> 01:09:52.708
Then you get other problems on the left hand side, you see.

01:09:52.828 --> 01:09:55.228
Even paralysis can be due to this.

01:09:55.348 --> 01:10:00.162
It’s a very bad thing to work like that, worrying about it.

01:10:00.282 --> 01:10:01.980
Are you all right?

01:10:05.179 --> 01:10:07.217
It will work out. What is it, John?

01:10:07.337 --> 01:10:08.495
John Watkinson: Nabhi.

01:10:08.615 --> 01:10:10.894
Shri Mataji: Nabhi? Nabhi.

01:10:11.014 --> 01:10:15.749
Put your left hand on the stomach. Stomach, yes.

01:10:16.551 --> 01:10:18.345
What about him?

01:10:18.465 --> 01:10:20.418
Yogini: Left Nabhi

01:10:20.710 --> 01:10:23.032
Shri Mataji: Are you married?Seeker: I’m not

01:10:23.152 --> 01:10:25.027
You are not married?Seeker: No.

01:10:25.147 --> 01:10:29.659
Shri Mataji: You don’t want to marry?Seeker: I’m a widower.

01:10:30.892 --> 01:10:32.395
Shri Mataji: When was that?

01:10:32.515 --> 01:10:34.235
Seeker: About eight years ago.
