00:00:16.342 --> 00:00:22.246
Today is a very great day for all the sahaja
yogis;

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:34.322
because Sahasrara opened in you, you could
feel the existence of God.

00:00:34.523 --> 00:00:40.326
By saying there is God that was not
sufficient

00:00:40.527 --> 00:00:48.808
and to say there is no God also was wrong,
very wrong

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:55.216
and people have suffered who have said
like them.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.748
Only after getting realisation you know

00:01:00.954 --> 00:01:07.883
that there is God and there are vibrations.

00:01:08.084 --> 00:01:15.084
It's a very big opening all over the world.

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:22.133
Today I say that's why is one of
the greatest day for you.

00:01:27.449 --> 00:01:38.760
Many of you have felt the cool breeze on
your hands and out of your brain.

00:01:39.562 --> 00:01:44.968
Some have grown in Sahaja Yoga, some
have not.

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:57.728
Some are still carrying on with old
catches.

00:02:01.447 --> 00:02:09.411
But now I have to say that quite a lot of
you can become gurus,

00:02:09.612 --> 00:02:17.460
means teachers, and you should act as
teachers.

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:29.585
To act as teacher you should know Sahaja
Yoga, the theory and the practice of it,

00:02:29.786 --> 00:02:36.690
thoroughly well and then you can become
a guru.

00:02:36.891 --> 00:02:47.660
It's a very responsibility, lot of
understanding for a guru.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.850
You should not have any ego, first;

00:02:57.581 --> 00:03:03.531
you should not have any of your chakras
catching;

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.557
you should be absolutely clear all the time

00:03:08.764 --> 00:03:15.412
and there the vibrations should be flowing
in both the hands.

00:03:15.613 --> 00:03:21.650
If they are moving in one hand and not in
another you cannot become guru.

00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:33.329
So you have to be a perfect Sahaja Yogi.
Then only you can be a guru,

00:03:34.874 --> 00:03:39.335
and so many of you can be,

00:03:39.536 --> 00:03:48.271
but you have to ascertain first: are you
capable of being a guru or not.

00:03:49.523 --> 00:03:53.639
With humbleness you'll understand.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.452
Those who think they can be guru should
become gurus

00:04:00.653 --> 00:04:06.386
because now I can't travel from places
to places

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:14.540
and you have to do My job, is to give
realisation to people.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.760
But you have be able to give en-masse
realisation,

00:04:20.961 --> 00:04:25.466
then only you could be a guru.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:34.696
If you can give en-masse realisation then
you could be a guru.

00:04:34.897 --> 00:04:38.745
You can use My photograph

00:04:38.946 --> 00:04:46.659
but the realisation should not be from
the photograph,

00:04:47.844 --> 00:04:51.107
but from you.

00:04:53.598 --> 00:04:57.722
Then only you can be a guru.

00:05:00.638 --> 00:05:07.813
There can be ladies or men, both can become
gurus

00:05:08.014 --> 00:05:12.312
and spread Sahaja Yoga all over.

00:05:13.697 --> 00:05:20.198
In My whole touring business, Canada
I have missed

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:28.193
and I would request some of you to go to
Canada because it's a very beautiful place

00:05:28.394 --> 00:05:33.138
and we have very beautiful Sahaja Yogis
there.

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:40.829
You have to do now My work. I won't be able
to go all over,

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:49.676
but you have to go to other countries and
create new Sahaja Yogis.

00:05:49.877 --> 00:05:52.805
You can do it.

00:05:53.307 --> 00:06:00.062
To begin with you can use My photograph
but later on

00:06:00.263 --> 00:06:12.899
you can only put the photograph there but
use your own powers and give realisation.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:21.842
You can do it, and that is how we can
spread Sahaja Yoga all over the world.

00:06:22.043 --> 00:06:30.529
I have done My level best now but I don't
think now I can travel any more,

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:40.862
so I'm telling you that you have to take
over and work it out.

00:06:41.473 --> 00:06:46.957
That doesn't mean you cancel Me, no,
not at all.

00:06:47.158 --> 00:06:55.086
I am there with you and every place you
work you put My photograph,

00:06:55.287 --> 00:07:04.535
but realisation you have to give and try
to give mass realisation.

00:07:04.736 --> 00:07:12.908
If that doesn't work out then you should
know you are not a guru.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:23.129
If you can give mass realisation, then only
you are a guru.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.137
Otherwise you are not.

00:07:27.922 --> 00:07:38.932
I said you can use My photograph but you
have to give realisation to people.

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:43.768
This is the sign of a guru.

00:07:47.688 --> 00:07:55.008
Then you already know what are different
centres

00:07:55.209 --> 00:08:03.637
and what are the things missing in people.
I've explained very clearly.

00:08:03.838 --> 00:08:09.502
In the same way you'll find those who come
for realisation,

00:08:09.703 --> 00:08:17.632
they'll have some defects and you'll find
out what chakras they are catching.

00:08:17.833 --> 00:08:26.663
You know how to clear those chakras, so you
have to tell them how to clear.

00:08:26.864 --> 00:08:34.399
Now you have mastered Sahaja Yoga so you
should know what is to be done.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:42.752
If you think you have mastered, if you
believe that you have mastered,

00:08:43.629 --> 00:08:47.609
then you can become gurus.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:55.683
But first of all, you should ascertain and
find out for yourself

00:08:55.884 --> 00:09:00.139
if you are a guru or not.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:07.650
It is your responsibility now to give
realisation to people

00:09:10.765 --> 00:09:23.423
and you can give if you have vibrations
as like a guru.

00:09:24.863 --> 00:09:35.823
Or ladies also, they're called as guruvi,
not as gurus, but as guruvis,

00:09:36.024 --> 00:09:40.392
but they can be called as guru also.

00:09:41.991 --> 00:09:46.411
And they can also do this work very well.

00:09:46.612 --> 00:09:51.788
Solving the problems of people is not
difficult then.

00:09:51.989 --> 00:09:59.546
Once they get realisation, their problems
will be solved.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:06.369
This is a big power you have got, you all
should use.

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:12.027
First of all, you can use a group if you
want

00:10:12.231 --> 00:10:17.947
and afterwards, you should do it
individually.

00:10:18.148 --> 00:10:23.118
Can you imagine all of you, if you become
gurus,

00:10:23.319 --> 00:10:28.637
how many Sahaja Yogis we'll have all over
the world?

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:40.351
Whatever you teach, you must practice.

00:10:40.552 --> 00:10:45.370
When a person who drinks, cannot become
a guru.

00:10:45.571 --> 00:10:53.478
A person who flirts and has a licentious
life, cannot become a guru.

00:10:53.679 --> 00:11:01.073
So first examine yourself: are you clean
or not?

00:11:03.352 --> 00:11:09.967
If there are many possessed people who try
to become gurus, they cannot.

00:11:10.168 --> 00:11:17.658
Honestly you should see on the photograph
if you are possessed,

00:11:18.015 --> 00:11:25.231
then you cannot be guru. So now to become
a guru is first to criticise yourself,

00:11:25.432 --> 00:11:32.321
to find out yourself fully, and then you
can become a guru.

00:11:32.522 --> 00:11:41.281
I don't want to tell anybody individually
but you all can find out.

00:11:41.482 --> 00:11:46.720
Say four-five people can join together

00:11:48.016 --> 00:11:55.457
and they can find out from each other if
they are all right or not,

00:11:55.658 --> 00:12:00.876
if there is missing, if they are catching.

00:12:01.193 --> 00:12:07.137
But if they say there you are alright then
you can become gurus

00:12:07.338 --> 00:12:15.926
and you can preach Sahaja Yoga. This is
your responsibility.

00:12:16.127 --> 00:12:19.768
This is how Sahaja Yoga will grow.

00:12:19.969 --> 00:12:29.350
Otherwise, after I'll retire or I'll don't
go anywhere,

00:12:29.551 --> 00:12:34.370
then Sahaja Yoga will go into waste.

00:12:36.853 --> 00:12:44.975
So it is for you to carry the torch,
the light.

00:12:45.176 --> 00:12:54.992
It's your responsibility now. You have got
your realisation.

00:12:57.499 --> 00:13:02.159
I was born with the responsibility,

00:13:03.173 --> 00:13:06.670
I was born with all the understanding.

00:13:06.871 --> 00:13:13.338
And now you are also understanding
yourself.

00:13:13.539 --> 00:13:21.447
Do not condemn yourself, as long as you
start your own realisation,

00:13:21.648 --> 00:13:28.284
but be careful: don't become egoistical.

00:13:28.485 --> 00:13:35.741
You have to be very humble, very humble
with everyone.

00:13:35.942 --> 00:13:41.278
And work it out because if they are not
realised souls

00:13:41.479 --> 00:13:49.050
you shouldn't condemn them but tell them
very patiently and sweetly

00:13:49.251 --> 00:13:57.348
that "you are not alright". Tell them how
to meditate, how to improve.

00:13:57.549 --> 00:14:02.267
It's now a very big responsibility.

00:14:02.468 --> 00:14:13.592
Actually, I have done this work and you can
do this work also.

00:14:13.793 --> 00:14:17.751
So you all have to become a guru.

00:14:17.952 --> 00:14:27.774
This is the day of Guru Purnima and I bless
you that you all become gurus.

00:14:27.975 --> 00:14:33.288
Whatever you have got now, don't waste it.

00:14:33.489 --> 00:14:42.112
Don't throw away, but use it for
the betterment of people.

00:14:42.313 --> 00:14:48.766
If you want, in the beginning, have four
to five people together.

00:14:48.967 --> 00:14:54.597
Then you should separate. You have to give
time to this.

00:14:54.798 --> 00:15:02.632
You have got your realisation but you have
to give realisation

00:15:02.833 --> 00:15:13.629
otherwise, your state is not alright, is
not normal.

00:15:14.821 --> 00:15:24.433
So today I want to tell you what are
the qualities needed for a guru.

00:15:29.877 --> 00:15:39.415
First of all, he should be a detached
person.

00:15:42.823 --> 00:15:46.963
That doesn't mean you give up your family
or anything,

00:15:47.164 --> 00:15:51.225
but you should have a detached attitude

00:15:51.426 --> 00:16:00.974
that anybody from your family does wrong,
you should go away from him or her.

00:16:03.246 --> 00:16:12.120
Secondly, through your realisation you can
see that you can spread happiness

00:16:12.321 --> 00:16:19.416
and remove their problems. You have seen
whatever I have done you can do it.

00:16:19.617 --> 00:16:26.261
You have got power to do it but no
hypocrisy.

00:16:26.462 --> 00:16:32.874
No hypocrisy, otherwise you'll spoil
the name of Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:33.075 --> 00:16:41.510
So if you are sure about yourself then only
you should become gurus

00:16:41.711 --> 00:16:45.757
and carry the work of Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:54.643
I think, I give you all My blessings and
all My support

00:16:54.844 --> 00:17:01.599
that now you take over and become gurus.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:10.825
You can also have all the pujas and then
you can use photograph.

00:17:15.416 --> 00:17:23.163
You have seen how one has to work it out
and if somebody has some defect

00:17:23.364 --> 00:17:31.330
or some chakras are catching, then you
should tell that person how to correct it.

00:17:31.531 --> 00:17:38.075
On the photograph it is the best. And very
humbly you should tell them

00:17:38.276 --> 00:17:44.300
what is to be done and you can save all
the people.

00:17:44.501 --> 00:17:52.801
So now I am no more available in the sense,
I've done My best

00:17:53.002 --> 00:18:02.486
and I think I won't be able to do this
again.

00:18:04.491 --> 00:18:17.036
It is not My old age but I want to give you
a complete freedom to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:17.237 --> 00:18:28.113
You have got it free and you also have to
give it to people free - not to charge them.

00:18:28.365 --> 00:18:42.235
On puja days only, be careful that don't
put yourself on the puja.

00:18:42.436 --> 00:18:47.847
Till you are confirmed and you are sure

00:18:48.048 --> 00:18:55.697
that you have created at least hundred
Sahaja Yogis, good Sahaja Yogis.

00:18:55.898 --> 00:19:03.747
Then they can do your puja also. But
the best thing is to wait and see.

00:19:03.948 --> 00:19:11.315
You don't end to puja business till you are -

00:19:11.516 --> 00:19:23.485
you have done about thousand people each,
then you have the right to have a puja.

00:19:23.686 --> 00:19:31.050
But you could have a puja with My
photograph till you are completely alright.

00:19:31.251 --> 00:19:35.206
Now how confidence is the main thing.

00:19:35.407 --> 00:19:41.563
Do not condemn yourself. You are all
realised souls,

00:19:41.764 --> 00:19:49.781
but those who can think they can become
gurus, can become and try.

00:19:49.982 --> 00:19:56.028
You have to have patience with the seekers.

00:19:56.229 --> 00:20:01.714
You can't be angry and hot-tempered.

00:20:01.915 --> 00:20:13.379
Unless and until they try to trouble you,
you shouldn't lose your temper.

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:16.512
You should be quiet.

00:20:16.713 --> 00:20:23.513
Most of the gurus are very hot-tempered
or have been before

00:20:23.714 --> 00:20:26.799
and that's why they were busy with their
temper

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:35.258
and couldn't produce anything sensible, I
think. They could never give Realisation.

00:20:35.459 --> 00:20:43.118
So, I have to warn you - control your
temper.

00:20:43.319 --> 00:20:50.102
Watch yourself if you get angry, then you
cannot become a guru.

00:20:50.303 --> 00:20:58.588
Guru has to be a loving person, very loving
and understanding.

00:20:58.985 --> 00:21:10.048
Then you have to be humble, not to abuse
people, not to shout at people.

00:21:10.249 --> 00:21:17.871
If they misbehave, you can ask them
to go out, but don't shout.

00:21:18.072 --> 00:21:23.913
If you think somebody is misbehaving, you
can ask that person to get out,

00:21:24.114 --> 00:21:29.451
but you need not shout or get angry with
that person.

00:21:29.887 --> 00:21:37.333
So it's a very big responsibility now.
You've got your Realisation

00:21:37.534 --> 00:21:45.055
and so four or five of you should join
to form a Sahaja Yoga group,

00:21:45.256 --> 00:21:53.060
giving Realisation to people. Try.

00:21:53.261 --> 00:21:59.823
Of course, My photograph will be there, but
still you must try.

00:22:00.024 --> 00:22:06.100
Try to understand that now what is your
responsibility.

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:14.388
If a position is given, you have to always
carry on

00:22:14.589 --> 00:22:25.088
with the responsibility of that position.
In the same way, if you become

00:22:25.763 --> 00:22:33.264
a guru, you have a certain amount
of responsibility

00:22:33.465 --> 00:22:41.738
that your own behaviour should be very good
to begin with.

00:22:44.579 --> 00:22:48.645
In the beginning, you cannot tell them,
"Don't go to church,"

00:22:48.846 --> 00:22:54.298
or "Don't do this, don't do that."

00:22:54.973 --> 00:23:01.444
You give them Realization and then you can
talk to them.

00:23:02.817 --> 00:23:09.477
In the beginning, you shouldn't tell them
or they'll just shun you.

00:23:09.678 --> 00:23:13.810
Accept them as they are.

00:23:14.011 --> 00:23:19.564
In the beginning, you should not also cure
people if possible.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:28.137
You can use My photograph to begin with,
but don't cure them.

00:23:28.338 --> 00:23:37.135
Later on if you are confident, then four,
five together should treat that person.

00:23:43.262 --> 00:23:49.891
Curing people is not very easy and you may
catch,

00:23:50.092 --> 00:23:56.867
so before acting on them you must take
a bandhan. Bandhan is very good.

00:23:57.068 --> 00:24:03.020
You should, even when you are going out,
you should take a bandhan.

00:24:06.652 --> 00:24:14.115
You should also make a very good speech,
if possible.

00:24:14.316 --> 00:24:20.165
Now you know so many things and you can
talk to them.

00:24:20.366 --> 00:24:24.281
It's a very big responsibility.

00:24:24.482 --> 00:24:30.177
Now I have been working from the year 1970

00:24:30.378 --> 00:24:38.100
and today, so many years I have worked
so hard, but I can't now do it.

00:24:38.301 --> 00:24:48.310
I have to go back and take some rest as
everybody has said, and you will also agree.

00:24:48.511 --> 00:24:58.301
But you can tell about Me, if it is
necessary, but use My photograph.

00:24:58.502 --> 00:25:04.757
Every time you have a meeting, use
My photograph.

00:25:06.916 --> 00:25:13.336
Those who think they can be leaders and,
as gurus,

00:25:13.537 --> 00:25:23.038
they should first see their own vibrations.
Meditate on My photograph and find out.

00:25:23.239 --> 00:25:30.841
You have to be absolutely honest that you
are hundred percent all right

00:25:31.042 --> 00:25:38.785
and there is no catch and then you can
become a guru.

00:25:39.837 --> 00:25:42.937
You have to be.

00:25:43.874 --> 00:25:52.559
First you may get two people, then three
people. I started with five.

00:25:52.741 --> 00:25:59.323
So you can imagine how one can go with it.

00:25:59.743 --> 00:26:07.737
Try first of all with two, three, five and
more.

00:26:07.938 --> 00:26:15.371
You can also advertise afterwards, if you
have given Realization to people,

00:26:15.572 --> 00:26:24.265
say about - you have given Realization
to ten people - you can start

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:35.450
your own organization, or whatever you may
call, and can work it out.

00:26:35.651 --> 00:26:39.494
Now you have the power,

00:26:41.974 --> 00:26:50.269
you have the right, but you must have
a temperament also.

00:26:50.609 --> 00:26:57.010
In the beginning, you have to be very
patient and kind –

00:27:00.638 --> 00:27:03.658
very kind.

00:27:05.355 --> 00:27:10.335
Then gradually, you'll find that you can
cure people.

00:27:10.536 --> 00:27:14.770
You can use My photograph for curing
to begin with

00:27:14.971 --> 00:27:18.951
and later on you can see you can cure.

00:27:19.152 --> 00:27:25.882
First of all, on vibrations you'll see what
chakras are catching,

00:27:26.083 --> 00:27:30.028
which are good, which are bad.

00:27:32.395 --> 00:27:36.016
And then you should correct them.

00:27:36.217 --> 00:27:42.859
If there's something wrong, you must
correct it and then become guru.

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:47.449
It's not just accepting that “I am guru”
you become guru,

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:52.688
but you have to be very, very –

00:27:57.159 --> 00:28:04.230
authority on yourself. You have to judge
yourself.

00:28:04.431 --> 00:28:10.142
First of all, you should find out: can you
become gurus?

00:28:14.707 --> 00:28:18.101
And then you can send Me your reports.

00:28:18.302 --> 00:28:24.746
I'd be very happy to know how many you
have got now.

00:28:24.947 --> 00:28:31.619
And that is how Sahaja Yoga would spread,
no doubt.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:38.706
It is - it cannot remain at this stage
because I am withdrawing,

00:28:38.907 --> 00:28:46.216
but because now you are so many Sahaja
Yogis, it will grow and work out.

00:28:46.417 --> 00:28:53.698
But I think now I can't travel, and I am
going back.

00:28:53.899 --> 00:29:00.581
I won't be able to come back again –
not possible.

00:29:02.351 --> 00:29:10.269
So you better work it out for yourself.

00:29:10.669 --> 00:29:15.236
You must write to Me if you have any
difficulties,

00:29:15.437 --> 00:29:21.996
if somebody is catching or something, or
you have problem.

00:29:22.197 --> 00:29:27.784
Now I don't think any newspaper will
criticize you.

00:29:27.985 --> 00:29:33.935
They have done it for Me, but not for you.

00:29:35.482 --> 00:29:43.373
All of you promise Me that you'll try
to become gurus.

00:29:48.449 --> 00:29:54.508
I didn't take any money from you, nothing
from you.

00:29:54.709 --> 00:30:00.761
I just want that you should spread Sahaja
Yoga.

00:30:00.962 --> 00:30:10.416
In the beginning, even in the pujas, don't
take any presents or money.

00:30:10.617 --> 00:30:14.281
You can only take little money from them

00:30:14.482 --> 00:30:25.606
if you have need to have a hall or a big
place,

00:30:25.807 --> 00:30:29.726
but that would be much later.

00:30:30.573 --> 00:30:35.536
First of all, try with few people.

00:30:35.737 --> 00:30:42.152
It will grow very well.

00:30:42.353 --> 00:30:45.981
Now, the another thing is,

00:30:46.182 --> 00:30:52.655
puja you should not allow them to do
to you, to begin with.

00:30:52.856 --> 00:31:02.716
Till you have done three hundred Sahaja
Yogis, you can't ask them to do you puja.

00:31:02.917 --> 00:31:09.582
You can use My photograph for the puja,
to begin with,

00:31:09.828 --> 00:31:16.421
but be very careful because you have powers
now

00:31:16.622 --> 00:31:27.141
and it might pamper your ego, maybe you
start thinking you are great – no.

00:31:27.342 --> 00:31:34.173
You have to save the world. All My work is
that,

00:31:34.374 --> 00:31:44.296
and I would ask you to write to Me in India
if there is any difficulty.

00:31:45.595 --> 00:31:49.187
Also write to Me how you are spreading
Sahaja Yoga,

00:31:49.406 --> 00:31:53.702
what is happening, I would like to know.

00:31:54.734 --> 00:32:03.645
But I think you will understand that I must
retire now. I can't travel.

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:09.952
If you have any questions, ask Me.

00:32:24.076 --> 00:32:31.024
Those who are confident that they can
become gurus, raise your hands.

00:32:34.891 --> 00:32:38.132
Oh, so many.

00:32:42.912 --> 00:32:46.986
Only one hand, not two.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:59.853
If anybody is making money, you should tell
him not to do it

00:33:00.039 --> 00:33:08.524
and also write to Me. You cannot make
money, to begin with,

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:15.435
but when you have about three thousand
people,

00:33:15.636 --> 00:33:26.059
you can celebrate all the worshipping days
and worship.

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:31.510
But you must make at least three thousand
disciples, each.

00:33:31.711 --> 00:33:39.443
Then you can ask for a puja.

00:33:48.808 --> 00:33:53.245
There are some people who cannot become
gurus,

00:33:53.446 --> 00:33:58.751
who are catching and they have problems.

00:33:58.952 --> 00:34:04.901
If you have problems, don't become guru,
otherwise, it will affect you.

00:34:05.102 --> 00:34:13.684
But if you think you are clear and opened
out, then you can become gurus.

00:34:17.232 --> 00:34:20.756
Is there any question?

00:34:40.856 --> 00:34:48.346
I am opening a centre for international
Sahaja Yoga

00:34:48.547 --> 00:34:53.118
and when you have done with three hundred
Sahaja Yogis,

00:34:53.319 --> 00:34:58.638
you can ask them to do puja and take money.

00:34:58.839 --> 00:35:05.847
Before that, if you get any money, you can
send it to that centre.

00:35:08.543 --> 00:35:15.207
There would be about eleven members in that
centre and I'll declare it.

00:35:15.408 --> 00:35:19.888
If you have any questions, ask Me now.

00:35:29.922 --> 00:35:34.998
First three hundred people you don't take
any money,

00:35:35.736 --> 00:35:44.028
except for the hall or except for other
expenses.

00:35:44.229 --> 00:35:51.216
But you don't take any money for yourself.

00:35:54.917 --> 00:36:01.197
Now, can you raise again your hands how
many would like to be gurus?

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:09.253
May God bless you.

00:36:18.958 --> 00:36:22.879
Do you have any questions?

00:36:42.134 --> 00:36:46.380
You can take money on organization basis,

00:36:46.581 --> 00:36:52.709
that you have to have a hall, loudspeaker,
and all those things.

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:57.716
But you shouldn't take it for your
individual use.

00:36:57.930 --> 00:37:04.783
You should be very careful till you have
three hundred Sahaja Yogis.

00:37:05.302 --> 00:37:14.389
You can form a group of five to ten people
and start your work.

00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:17.619
You'll enjoy it.

00:37:27.901 --> 00:37:32.534
Anyone has any problem, ask Me.

00:37:54.565 --> 00:38:01.700
I have to go to Canada - I have not been,
but I'll try to find some time.

00:38:01.901 --> 00:38:09.751
First now I have to go to Russia, and then
I can go to Canada.

00:38:12.949 --> 00:38:20.600
You have to work more in your country than
outside, to begin with,

00:38:22.298 --> 00:38:26.672
and then you can spread it all over.

00:38:28.486 --> 00:38:35.883
Again let us see how many want to be gurus?

00:38:36.316 --> 00:38:41.740
Oh! What a big number.

00:38:41.941 --> 00:38:47.111
Thank you very much, thank you, thank
you all.

00:39:17.443 --> 00:39:19.531
Yogi: Should we do the Aarti?
Shri Mataji: Yes, you may do, it went well.

00:39:19.732 --> 00:39:23.373
Yogi: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: From where are they all?

00:39:35.248 --> 00:39:38.057
Yogi: Are we permitted to do Aarti? Aarti?
Shri Mataji: We should go…

00:39:38.258 --> 00:39:41.470
Yogi: Jai Shri Mataji!
Shri Mataji: Do Aarti.
