1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So we'll just start with a silent meditation for about 10 minutes while other people join us and

2
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Ritter will be playing some music. I'll just take you through a few

3
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:34.000
balancing a couple of balancing mantras at the beginning and then we'll have some meditation with music in the background.

4
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And and then we'll start eating. So.

5
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I think it's nice when we're meditating, if we just all turn our cameras off.

6
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And so we're not watching each other raise our Kundalini's.

7
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So if everybody is now.

8
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Ready to meditate. We can just all do a little namaskar to Shri Mataji.

9
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And collectively raise our Kundalini's and put on.

10
00:01:39.000 --> 00:02:08.000
But.

11
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And with our right hand on the ground or pointing towards some other earth.

12
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
We'll say three times the mantra to Shri Ganesha.

13
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Asking him to overcome any obstacles that there might be to us meeting joyfully this evening.

14
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Ganesha Sakshat Shri Adishakti Mataji

15
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Naha

16
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Ganesha Sakshat Shri Adishakti Mataji

17
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Naha

18
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Ganesha Sakshat Shri Adishakti Mataji

19
00:03:49.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Naha

20
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And with our right hand.

21
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:34.000
On the ground still. We'll take the mantra to for the whole of the left side just to balance out clear out the left side and let it drain into the earth.

22
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And that Shri Mahakali Bhairava.

23
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Michael. So Shri Mahakali Shri Bhairava Shri Michael.

24
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Nirmala Devi Namo Naha

25
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And then move our right hand on to our knee again, and our left hand pointing towards the ether.

26
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
We'll just allow.

27
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:11.000
All the heat of our activities throughout the day, just to drain into ether through our left hand.

28
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:23.000
As we say the mantra to Shri Mahasaya Rati Hanumanan Gabriel Shri Mahasaya Rati Shri Hanumanan Shri Gabriel.

29
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Mahasaya Rati Shri Hanumanan Shri Gabriel Sakshat

30
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Shri Adishakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Naha

31
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Shri Namo Naha Shri Namo Naha

32
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:44.000
We'll take the mantra for the central channel.

33
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Shri Mahalakshmi Shri Ganesha

34
00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Mahalakshmi Shri Ganesha Sakshat

35
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Shri Adishakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Naha

36
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And we'll just sit for a few minutes in silence. In a moment Rita will start some music, and I suggest that we all during the music just raise our Kundalini's again three times just raise moving our right hand up long central channel up over the top of our head and

37
00:08:46.000 --> 00:09:09.000
with our hands spiraling out from the center of our sasrara to take in the whole of the top of the head three times. I was finding that brings up so much more of the Kundalini when we do that. We'll listen to music for five or six minutes and then Rita will be playing

38
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:37.000
one of the very earliest bad jams and also showing a clip of Shri Mataji.

39
00:09:37.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi Namo Naha

40
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi Namo Naha

41
00:10:31.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi Namo Naha

42
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Mother let me walk to sleep.

43
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Mother let me walk to sleep.

44
00:11:37.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Mother let me walk to sleep.

45
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Mother let me walk to sleep.

46
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Mother let me walk to sleep.

47
00:12:46.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Mother let me walk to sleep.

48
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Mother let me walk to sleep.

49
00:13:39.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Mother let me walk to sleep.

50
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Mother let me walk to sleep.

51
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Mother let me walk to sleep.

52
00:14:48.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Mother let me walk to sleep.

53
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Should be muted.

54
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Mother I should unmute myself.

55
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Nothing.

56
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Well, we were planning to show you a video of Shri Mataji entering the Thames.

57
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:52.000
I think the first time that she entered the waters that are the source of the Thames. But I'm not sure if we're able to.

58
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.000
So let's just dive straight in. It is almost 10 to 8 anyway.

59
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
So I just want to welcome everybody.

60
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Everybody that was here the last times and everybody that's come for the first time.

61
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:15.000
This time I see that Linda Williams has got on. She's managed to beat the technology and join us.

62
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
That's wonderful.

63
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
I.

64
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:28.000
As you know, this is an occasion for us to share stories about the early days and about our meetings with Shri Mataji.

65
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.000
We've specifically asked a handful of people if they can share a story to start off with.

66
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:42.000
But we were expecting this to last about an hour and a half. So until about nine o'clock.

67
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:49.000
So after they've spoken, we'll just open it up for anybody to offer the regulations that they have.

68
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.000
So the list I have, Meera is on my list, but I can't see her anywhere.

69
00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:03.000
I'm not sure she's been able to join us. But then Ruth Flint.

70
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Captain, the caliber matter.

71
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:14.000
And I Grets I've seen and Ken Williams. So Ruth, can I pass the word to you?

72
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Do you like to meet yourself and tell us your story? So nice to see you.

73
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Good evening, everybody. It's nice to see all these familiar faces.

74
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:32.000
I'm not quite sure. I mean, I heard that we were supposed to say why we wanted to go to a big program.

75
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:41.000
But me, my story is a bit different. So I can say it very briefly for those who don't know it.

76
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:50.000
I was a seeker like many of us, and I was lucky enough to meet Craig in 1981, in Rome.

77
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
And I had heard he had lived in Nall.

78
00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:05.000
And as I loved history of art and art, I asked, and so I believed that there was something in Christianity that I had left the research.

79
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:12.000
I asked him if he was interested in religions. He said yes a little bit.

80
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:20.000
And then I asked, where did you find a way of putting together Oriental religion and Christianism?

81
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000
And he said, yes, I think so. So I said, well, please tell me.

82
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:36.000
And he said, well, all religions, they are like a pyramid. So at the base, they are all away from each other.

83
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:46.000
And the more you go up towards the essence, and the more they get close to each other, and they are the one.

84
00:18:46.000 --> 00:19:00.000
So I loved very much this answer. And then I started asking him day after day, because we were working together, questions about what he told me the day before, what it meant, and all that.

85
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:08.000
He never said the word Sahaja Yoga, never spoke about Shri Mataji. That's explained more and more.

86
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:20.000
And I liked it a lot. And so the day of the marriage of Charles and Diana, everybody at work was watching the TV, the marriage on the TV.

87
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
And he told me, come, let's go to your office and I'll make you a little drawing.

88
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:35.000
And he made the drawing of the Chakra and said, you see, and this is realization once you are at the top there.

89
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:42.000
And because I had read about realization in Kundalini, I told him that's what I want.

90
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:51.000
And so he gave me an appointment one week later at the flat with him and Catherine. They gave me realization.

91
00:19:51.000 --> 00:20:01.000
And I think that maybe a few days before, he gave me a photocopy of a newspaper article with a photo of Shri Mataji.

92
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.000
He said, well, put your feet in the water while watching, while looking at this photocopy.

93
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
So I did that. And so he introduced me to Shri Mataji.

94
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
And then a little time later, I mean, I recognized her.

95
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Trina Drouin did not need to tell me who she was. She came neverly.

96
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
And then a few months later, I met her. That's how it is.

97
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Beautiful.

98
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Catherine, would you like to carry on from or not carry on, but tell one story?

99
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
Yes. OK. Good evening, everybody.

100
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:51.000
It's nice that we have this meeting and we can see each other, at least see each other.

101
00:20:51.000 --> 00:21:00.000
No, I was studying and I was not a seeker as such.

102
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:13.000
What I always felt is that if we had a party, I would come home with no added value.

103
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:21.000
So in that sense, I was not the party girl much.

104
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:30.000
And studying kept us quite busy, you know, from eight to six in the evening, plus working at night.

105
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:39.000
So I said, as long as we study. And I was discussing that with a colleague of mine, which was studying.

106
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:47.000
From eight to six, there's not much time in the evening to do a lot of non-sentuous life.

107
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:57.000
But once we are out of university, how do we manage life that we don't go, you know, astray?

108
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:04.000
So she started to tell me, look, if you want to know how to manage your life properly,

109
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:12.000
I have a system where you get to know yourself and get to know what's right and wrong.

110
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:26.000
And a few weeks later, her brother joined her and they get a realisation with practically no introduction, not much.

111
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:42.000
It's suddenly before Shmadeji's picture saying this is a lead who can help you to connect to this energy with which you are going with and connecting to her will help you to manage your life.

112
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
All right.

113
00:22:44.000 --> 00:23:08.000
What happened after a nice day in the street, I walked home and you can not say it was a vision, but it was like in French, you would say in revelation or a painting in German.

114
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
It was clear to me.

115
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
I saw like a train.

116
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:21.000
This is the rail which I'm going to take straight ahead forward onto the left.

117
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
My family would drop out to the right.

118
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.000
My friends and colleagues would go on and that's it.

119
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Then a few months, three months later, I was in London for a birthday.

120
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:58.000
I didn't speak English, so somebody was helping me understand what Shmadeji was saying and what she was saying to me when I first bought her feet and washed her feet, which we all could do at that time.

121
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:09.000
And yeah, that was, we were just clear that was going to be my life.

122
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:16.000
And it stayed like that, hopefully.

123
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
But, Kavonlyn, back to you.

124
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
And I'll pass it back to Anagret.

125
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Yeah, Anagret is there and I think she may need a little help with technology. Anagret, can you hear us all?

126
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:41.000
And you see a mic and I think Anagret has to unmute herself. Can we unmute her?

127
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000
No.

128
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
So Anagret, you see a mic, you have to press that.

129
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000
Okay.

130
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Yeah, now we can hear you. Yes, perfect.

131
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Thanks, God. My gosh.

132
00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Yeah, we were having back and forth, but see, Shmadeji helped you with technology.

133
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Okay. Okay. So we'd love to hear, like I said, what is your, what took you to Sahaj the first time? What were your impressions?

134
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
We'd love to hear about that.

135
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Well, I tell you maybe how I came to get my realization.

136
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:27.000
I remember, well, I was brought up in a sort of way of the Catholic Church.

137
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:42.000
And I remember I must have been seven or eight years old and I always loved the months of May, which is in the Catholic Church, the months of the Mother Mary, where they worship especially Mother Mary.

138
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000
And I was, my teachers were nuns in the Catholic school.

139
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:58.000
And when we were doing well on Saturdays, we always got a token with a picture of Mother Mary. There were different pictures of Mother Mary with the child.

140
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:09.000
And I remember in the month of May, I always put on my night table a little altar with this picture of Mother Mary and a few flowers around.

141
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:30.000
And I just did it. It just gave me such a good feeling. And so years went by and I became a teenager and more and more I felt this Catholic Church, there's a lot of untruth in it, and I couldn't accept and understand many things.

142
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:40.000
And there was a sort of rebellion also inside of me. And when I was 18, I decided I'm officially leaving the Catholic Church.

143
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:53.000
So that was one thing, but I had nothing else. And I was not aware of a seeking. I started reading a lot of esoteric books and I was reading a lot of,

144
00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:06.000
well, I was trying to find it through my work in psychology and so on, but nothing really satisfied me. Then I thought, well, I'm going to travel.

145
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Maybe, you know, because I have read a lot about Buddhism and I was a bit in the Hinduistic religion, but it never really gave me this feeling, that's it.

146
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:36.000
So finally, I went on big journeys, which brought me to India. And I traveled for nearly a year around India. And there I could really visit.

147
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:43.000
I was up in Ladakh in Kashmir and visited all these temples of the Buddhists, of the Tibetans, of the Hindus.

148
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:52.000
And I only could feel each time afterwards, there's a lot of ritualism, there's a lot of strange things.

149
00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:02.000
There is a lot of, I had the feeling, money and power behind. And it was always the same, like I felt in the Catholic Church.

150
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:11.000
So finally I thought, well, this is my illusion. You know, there is nothing maybe which is something like a truth.

151
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:22.000
So I went back home, but it didn't leave me. I had, after two years, I had to go back to India again because I had this strong feeling something is waiting for me there.

152
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:31.000
And I went back to India again. Strangely enough, when I went to Mumbai, I had the feeling, what did I do? This is nonsense.

153
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:38.000
To start again, you know, to go through all this, which didn't bring you to what you were looking for.

154
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.000
So I travelled again around for three months, but all the same, I was so empty inside.

155
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:52.000
I had like, there was no joy in my heart. There was no, even there was no light inside of me. I had the feeling.

156
00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:04.000
So I decided, OK, either I go back to Germany or I go again to the Himalayas where I was before and go up to the Himalayas for a trekking.

157
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:18.000
And this is finally what I did. I went to Nepal, I went to Kathmandu, I went on this big Everest trip up to 5000 metres and all the same, all the same.

158
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:34.000
There was, I was in this beautiful, extraordinary, stunning nature, such a silence, snow and stones and beauty and this deep silence.

159
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:45.000
But inside of me, there was nearly desperation. And there was one thing, often in the evening when we stayed with our, with other travellers,

160
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000
we slept around and opened fire in these simple lodges in our sleeping bags.

161
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:58.000
And we were all fed up with the food we had for several weeks already, which was mostly rice and dal.

162
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:04.000
And we were all craving for our homey foods, each one in a different way.

163
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:14.000
So we, each time we started talking about food and this and that, you know, and what we would like and what's, it was just going on.

164
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:23.000
And often someone said, but when you are back in Kathmandu, you have to go to this Austrian restaurant, which is there.

165
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:36.000
And they have the most delicious food there. And as a German, which is from the south of Germany, which is nearly Austria, I, well, this is my homey food.

166
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:44.000
So I thought, well, if nothing else comforts me and satisfies me, this is my goal.

167
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:50.000
When I'm back in Kathmandu on my first evening, I am there in this restaurant.

168
00:30:50.000 --> 00:31:00.000
And this is what I did on my first evening. I went to this restaurant and there was on the wall a photo of an Indian lady.

169
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
And the owner of this restaurant was an Austrian called Lise Lotte.

170
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:11.000
And I asked her, who is this lady on this photo?

171
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.000
And she said, well, if I have time in between the servings, I come and tell you a little bit.

172
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:24.000
And so she came and told me a few things that this is Sremata Jhiner Maladevi.

173
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:39.000
And then she explained to me very briefly. And my first reaction was, oh, another philosophy, another belief, you know, another guru.

174
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:49.000
And but then something hooked me. She said, you can feel it immediately on your hands with a cool breeze or on top of your heads.

175
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:56.000
You can verify and you have to verify yourself, only yourself that you feel that.

176
00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:03.000
And then she invited me next day to come to her house and she could walk on me and she would tell me more.

177
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:11.000
And this is what I did. The next day I went to her. I had only one week left in Kathmandu before I went back to Germany.

178
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000
And I went to her and she put me immediately in a foot sock, worked on me in the back.

179
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000
She had a lot of glass bangers on her arms and it made such a rattle.

180
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.000
And she was she was making sounds like, what did you do? And I said, oh, my gosh, you know.

181
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:34.000
So I didn't understand the word. I just was, you know, just was sitting in the foot sock and waiting.

182
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.000
Nothing. I felt afterwards I left her. I had felt nothing.

183
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:45.000
No cool breeze, neither in my hands. And she invited me to come every day.

184
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:58.000
So I went back from her to my hotel alone to Kathmandu and suddenly it hit me.

185
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:04.000
It was like someone had put on the light in my heart.

186
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:15.000
It was it was so clear and so, so obvious, and this desperation was completely gone.

187
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:24.000
And I felt clearly. Gosh, I have arrived home. What is this?

188
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:32.000
And I felt packed. Packed like in a down jacket of protection.

189
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
That was my first and very strong feeling and all this emptiness.

190
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:45.000
But I felt before all this, this this. Yeah, this desperation completely had vanished.

191
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:54.000
And so I went every day to her. She worked on me and we talked a lot. Then I went back to Munich and well, I started meditating.

192
00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:02.000
There was no no yogi in Munich or there was only one in the whole of Germany, which was Thomas Menge.

193
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000
And so after a few weeks, I contacted Gregor, who was in Vienna at the time.

194
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:14.000
If you could send me his book and I could read a little bit and I needed some support.

195
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:21.000
And he had contacted someone who I got my realization in eighty four in April in Kathmandu.

196
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:37.000
And in the same month, she met that she was in Australia. And there she asked an Australian yogi who was married to a German to go to Munich, where I lived in such a such a yoga there.

197
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:47.000
And this is what she did. And Gregor made a connection. And he sent me a letter and we met up and we started meditating together.

198
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:59.000
And there when it started for me and I saw she met that she only a few months later in Switzerland at the Sriganesha Pucha, where I saw her first time.

199
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:06.000
So this is my story. The food did not do the quench didn't satisfy me.

200
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:15.000
But through the food, I got the satisfaction for what I was seeking.

201
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000
That's my story. Thank you so much.

202
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:27.000
Beautiful, beautiful story. Caroline, Ken has to leave.

203
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Can you not speak now? Yeah. So that is what I'm just.

204
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:39.000
Well, he's the last one on the list. There's nobody else. Oh, is he? OK. Ken, off to you.

205
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000
Oh, it's me now. How do I follow that one? I can't follow that one.

206
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:49.000
Mine is my story is nowhere near as dramatic and incredibly emotional as that.

207
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.000
Such a beautiful story you've told. So we're going to come down to the mundane a little bit now.

208
00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:05.000
But anyway, I just want to say that my I mean, the two questions, the themes for tonight are so interrelated.

209
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:13.000
You can just answer them really. You know, what was how did you feel? What was it again?

210
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Yeah. What was the what? Yeah. What is your main desire when you first met your Matthew and how was your first experience?

211
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:28.000
So I'll combine those questions. I, I need to go back to.

212
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Probably my first real experience of God, which was a lot back.

213
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:42.000
This was back in 1972. I went to church.

214
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:48.000
I'm going to be as brief as I can, but I went to church with my family as a child in Canada.

215
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:56.000
It meant nothing to me. It was just a lot of people singing hymns that went on forever and all that kind of thing.

216
00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:03.000
It just it I had some vague belief in the possibility of God. That's all I had.

217
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:10.000
But when I was I went to to theatre school in 1972 to train as an actor.

218
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
And then, you know, I started to experience a lot of things.

219
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:21.000
My life just became much deeper. And I think that's when any seeking really began.

220
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:29.000
And I just remember at one point everything was getting on top of me and it just seemed like I just couldn't cope.

221
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000
You know, it was a very intensive course and all that.

222
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:46.000
And I just remember one day I was alone and in our flat and I just found myself sort of collapsing onto the floor in what I would now know is like an enama scar.

223
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Like, like really as we would bow to shrimachi blows just down like that and just completely humbling down and just saying, help me, please help me, please.

224
00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000
I didn't even know who I'm saying that to just reaching out to the universe.

225
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:10.000
And I had the most amazing experience of just being lifted, like feeling within being lifted up somehow.

226
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:22.000
And I just had this feeling of a presence. And I felt at that point it was God saying to me, I'm here. Don't worry, I'm here. I'm real.

227
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:30.000
And I'm there in your heart. But you must promise me something. Don't ever get involved with any of these groups.

228
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000
No Maharishi, no Hare Krishna, no Jesus Freaks, nothing. You will only find me in your heart.

229
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:46.000
So I was never attracted to any of those things. They all repulsed me. Billy Graham, all these things, you know, that came along and promised to release you.

230
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:55.000
And then fast forward, moving to England in 1983 and then 1989.

231
00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:10.000
I had been doing, I've been practicing my craft as an actor, and I think my greatest desire at that time was to unlock the potential in me to communicate as an artist, as an actor.

232
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:18.000
And I began to get in theatre school, of course, I began to get a sense of what that might be, but I could never quite reach it.

233
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:28.000
I was doing hatha yoga. I discovered hatha yoga maybe about 10 years earlier.

234
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:39.000
And I did find that helpful because I found that it was unleashing certain energies within me, but there was no real focus to it.

235
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:54.000
There was no, I felt I needed guidance. I needed a teacher. And so, as I said, I knew I wasn't going to find it in any of these other groups and so-called religions and all this kind of stuff.

236
00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:01.000
And it just happened that one day I was walking up the hill. I lived in Haggard Hill in London, if that means anything to anyone.

237
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:12.000
And I was walking up the hill to my, to our flat and saw a poster on a bus stop for the meeting at Portchester Hall.

238
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:23.000
And there was Sri Mataji's big lovely face and it just, I walked past it and I just found myself going back.

239
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:30.000
Now this was unlike me. I was never drawn to these things, but I found this picture drew me.

240
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:41.000
And I can't remember anymore the exact wording on the poster, but it was saying basically sahaja yoga is the only way to save the world and to find your inner self.

241
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:49.000
And I thought, well, that's quite a claim. I'd love to go and hear this lady speak and see if she can back that up because that's amazing.

242
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:57.000
You know, that's sort of how my mind was working. I thought if she can really deliver that, I'm interested.

243
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:05.000
And I was surprised at my own lack of skepticism, you know, because normally I would be.

244
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:13.000
And I remember thinking, because I assumed that she was from India in the sense I didn't realize she was living in the UK at the time.

245
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:21.000
So I thought, well, her followers must be really excited that she's in this country. I don't know why that that came into my head, but it did quite strongly.

246
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:35.000
Anyway, so I thought, OK, I sort of made a note of the time and date of the meeting, which is just a few days away, got up to my flat and lo and behold, a leaflet had been put through the door.

247
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:42.000
And I thought I remember thinking of my exact thought was maybe the universe is trying to tell me something.

248
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:49.000
And so I read the leaflet and it was it was it was it was good. It was quite a detailed leaflet about the life of Shri Mataji and all that.

249
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:59.000
I would say at this point, I've always advocated that that sort of thing should be in a leaflet, because that's what made me come.

250
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:06.000
If it had just been a plain leaflet advertising the meeting and saying nothing more, I probably wouldn't have come.

251
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:13.000
But in fact, that it talked about her and her association with Gandhi and all that, that really sort of got me going.

252
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:29.000
And I said, I'm going, I'm going. So anyway, long story short, I love telling this part is that when the day came to go to the meeting, I went down to the tube station, Archway tube station, station closed.

253
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000
There's a fire in the station.

254
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:41.000
Now, if I hadn't, you know, had this strength of desire, I might have said, Oh, well, I guess it's not meant to be. But no, I've got to get there. Somehow, I've got to get there.

255
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:48.000
I'll just get on any bus that's going vaguely in the direction of the next tube station or something like that.

256
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.000
Anyway, I ended up getting on this bus that was going to Hammersmith.

257
00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:00.000
And I just was following it in my A to Z. Oh, OK, OK. Well, no, I won't get off the next station because it's going this way and this way.

258
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:06.000
It ended up dropping me. And I mean, London is a big city. The odds against this are pretty.

259
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:12.000
But it ended up dropping me right at the top of the road where poor Chester Hall is.

260
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000
So I remember thinking, ah, the universe really is. I'm meant to be here.

261
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:24.000
So, you know, went in and was handed my little photograph of Tromat's use. I still have to this day.

262
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:31.000
It was the classic black and white. And it was little instructions how to meditate with the photograph and all that.

263
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:41.000
And I just I just came into this meeting and there were people playing bajans and that went on forever and ever and ever.

264
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:47.000
I think it was supposed to start at seven thirty and here was eight thirty. No Srimati yet.

265
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:53.000
But I remember thinking what went through my head was this is a test because I didn't find the bajans very interesting, to be honest.

266
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:59.000
I thought this is a test. The true seekers, the true seekers will stay.

267
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:06.000
And, you know, and then David Spyro, David Spyro got up and he said, would you all stand please?

268
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000
And that was a really quite a magical moment because the hall went very quiet.

269
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:23.000
And this magnificent lady came in and took her place up the stage without a word and put on her glasses and just sat there very silently.

270
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:30.000
And they started resuming the bajans. And that went on for a long, long time, it seemed.

271
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:37.000
But I was just caught up in the spell somehow. Spell is probably the wrong word.

272
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:47.000
But in the atmosphere and when she spoke.

273
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:57.000
I couldn't understand. I understood about two thirds of what she said, because the hall was very echoey and I wasn't used to her strong Indian accent.

274
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000
And but I got all the gist and I got the emphasis.

275
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:08.000
And I remember when she said we're going to enter the kingdom of God, I thought.

276
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000
God, I just wanted to improve myself as an actor. This is great.

277
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000
We're actually going to enter the kingdom of God. I mean, it was really like that.

278
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:26.000
I'm just telling it in a funny way. But there was this this, you know, I expected just a good yoga teacher, you know, that would help me be a better actor or whatever.

279
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:38.000
And here was this lady saying we could enter the kingdom of God. And here was me actually say, believing it and say, well, I wish I'd worn a tie or something, you know, because this is big.

280
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:44.000
And so I did everything and went through the whole realization exercise.

281
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:51.000
And, you know, I can't say as I felt the cool breeze or anything, but it was just feeling much more than that somehow.

282
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:58.000
I mean, a cool breeze didn't even seem important at that point. It just I could feel the fullness of everything.

283
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:06.000
And then we were invited to go up and, you know, to be to meet Srimati and be worked on and that sort of thing.

284
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:12.000
And I didn't do it because the queue was so long and I was hungry. I was starving.

285
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:18.000
You know, the food theme. I was starving and I thought this is so much to absorb.

286
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:24.000
I'm just I'm fine. I'm just going to go home and I'll go out and find a set takeaway or something like that.

287
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:30.000
Well, you know, I went outside and I immediately there was a bus and I didn't even bother with the takeaway.

288
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000
I just got on this bus and went up to the top of the bus. There were other people there.

289
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:39.000
And I thought, what if these people can see that I've had something really special happen to me?

290
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:46.000
And yeah, I just I probably had a nibble or something when I got home, but I wasn't even concerned about food.

291
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:52.000
I just forgot about the food and just took this wonderful thing home with me.

292
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:57.000
And I remember when I went to a follow up meeting after that and that was great.

293
00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:03.000
But the first time I went to a regular Sahaj weekly meeting at Hampstead.

294
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:09.000
I just remember, you know, thinking, well, I hope these meetings are going to live up to everything I felt that day.

295
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000
I don't know if it's you know, this this is that was kind of a one off thing.

296
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Do the people who run these meetings, are they as special as she is and all that?

297
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:28.000
Well, I needn't have worried because when I arrived at this meeting, it was everyone was in silent meditation.

298
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:35.000
The meeting had already just begun and there was no nothing playing or no one talking, just absolute silent meditation.

299
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:42.000
And I felt like a wall literally in vibrations, as if I just was entering another world.

300
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:47.000
And I just sat down and I knew how to raise my Kundalini and I did all that.

301
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000
It was just the most beautiful thing.

302
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000
And then Mother's Video came on.

303
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000
Oh, introduced, of course, by Patty Prohl.

304
00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:02.000
And Patty Prohl was like this angel that stood at the front of the room and she was beaming, absolutely beaming.

305
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.000
And said, you know, I see that there's some new people here and all that kind of thing.

306
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:13.000
I felt so welcomed. And then Mother's Talk came on.

307
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000
I thought I am so in the right place, so in the right place.

308
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:28.000
And my wife, Jacqueline, we just had a three month old baby, you know, who's our second child.

309
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000
So she was home with the baby. She couldn't come to these meetings.

310
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:37.000
And I just started going regularly and I didn't say much about it.

311
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:46.000
And I just said, I told her a little bit about self-realization, but I didn't say anything about cool breezes or anything like that because I still didn't feel a cool breeze.

312
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:52.000
And then one morning, after about four or five weeks, I woke up and I just felt it spontaneously.

313
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000
I just woke up in the morning. I wasn't even meditating or anything.

314
00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000
And I went, oh my goodness, you know, and I woke Jacqueline up.

315
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:05.000
I said, you know, this self-realization I've been telling you about. I said, put your hand over my head.

316
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:11.000
I'd never mentioned cool breezes to her. And she literally went, oh, so it feels like a cool wind coming out of your head.

317
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000
I said, that's the self-realization I've been telling you about.

318
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:25.000
So that day we sat down with a cassette and I sat her down and I said, this is going to maybe feel a bit funny when I put this candle here and this photograph here.

319
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.000
And you're going to listen to this and tell me how you feel.

320
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:39.000
And she listened. And in the end, she was speechless and she just all she could say was, she's saying everything I've always felt in my heart.

321
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:46.000
I went, yes, because it was important to me that we would both we would both feel it.

322
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:55.000
And then the next sort of big thing.

323
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.000
Yeah, I suppose so we did meditate together after a while.

324
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:06.000
And after a while, I think she started to back away a bit or she started to feel it was maybe I was being too pushy with it and all that.

325
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000
And then so she said, I think I don't know if I want to keep. I said, don't worry.

326
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:15.000
Stop for a while. Stop meditating. It's fine. Just come to it in your own time.

327
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:21.000
And so, you know, she did. It was just back to being me. And then I.

328
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:27.000
Oh, gosh, you can stop me anytime. I've got to go. I've got to go in five minutes.

329
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:32.000
But I've got so many. Ken, Ken, I've just been told that Mira has actually nailed to join.

330
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:39.000
So if if you don't feel that I'm stopping you in mid-flow, then I will gently stop you now.

331
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:43.000
We'll be back. I'll be back. I've got Arnold Schwartz. Absolutely.

332
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:49.000
I'm sure you want lots more stories to tell us. And the trouble is that once you get going, it's one after another comes in.

333
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:57.000
We've all had that experience. And so I'll leave it there. Thank you so much for letting me tell you about my first experience.

334
00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000
Thank you. Thank you.

335
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:06.000
Jason, that's you. Yeah, I'm going to check out now because I've got I've got another meeting, believe it or not, at eight thirty.

336
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000
So not a Saj meeting, but it's just an acting meeting. So why everyone?

337
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:16.000
Jason, I buy my Ken. Bye, Ken.

338
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:22.000
Thank you. So yes. I'm also going to do the breakout rooms today.

339
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:26.000
No, no, no. We're not doing break.

340
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:31.000
No. Mira, are you here now? Can you? Yes. Can you hear me?

341
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:39.000
Lovely. We can hear you. Yes. OK. I mean, I'm seeing you as well. Wonderful that you are missing me.

342
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:45.000
I mean, such a feeling. And I tried half an hour to get in. Oh.

343
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:53.000
And then finally, Gunther called me and then open now, send me. So I got you.

344
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:59.000
And I'm very happy. Even a little bit later. So nice to see Maureen and everybody. Hello, Mira.

345
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:06.000
Hello, dear. Hello, my dear. So nice. So I'm not great. And all of you.

346
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:11.000
Thank you so much for having me here.

347
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:16.000
But did you have a story that you wanted to share?

348
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:24.000
And I missed the beginning. Is there something which is important to know or subject?

349
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:31.000
People have been talking mostly about how they got their realisation. But any story that you think that we would enjoy really Mira?

350
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:40.000
OK. Maybe. Yes. Maybe I will start us with that. Yeah. It's a long time back.

351
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:46.000
It's happened in my life. Like many of us. It was a period. Very, very difficult.

352
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:53.000
And I got also very sick and I didn't know if I will survive.

353
00:52:53.000 --> 00:53:01.000
Yeah. How my life will go on. And I think many times happening is like, yeah.

354
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:07.000
Then you start to ask. Yeah. As I did also. So especially I ask God.

355
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:14.000
So I ask, OK, what is this? If I have to die, then I will die. But what will happen with my children?

356
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:23.000
And still, I didn't have to give up. And that was the beginning of my seeking, probably even earlier.

357
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:37.000
But in a way, when I really started to to to search and then I went to study astrology because I wanted to know about my life.

358
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:45.000
Why it's happening to me like this, I have never done anything wrong to others and suffering like that.

359
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:52.000
And yes. And then the teacher's wife, she was a very active lady.

360
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:58.000
She went everywhere for meditation to all gurus. And and she always asked me.

361
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:04.000
And then I said, I don't know. I don't want what is meditation. I don't want to meditate.

362
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:11.000
So I was not really interested in that because I didn't know much about.

363
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:17.000
And then one day she asked me to to for a street where she went.

364
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:24.000
She wanted to go for a program that is a such program. And then I had a lot of pain.

365
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:30.000
And then she just told me, you know, you just make like so. And then you will get fine.

366
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:37.000
So I said, OK, let's go. So I went there with her. That was the program, a normal program.

367
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:49.000
And I didn't understand much. So. So I was listening what they do and then how they did the realizations program.

368
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:54.000
And but at the end, someone let me.

369
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.000
So I was sitting in front of a picture of she wanted to see.

370
00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:04.000
And I think in that moment, this connection started to to grow in me.

371
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:14.000
So vibrationally. And then after someone worked on me, even I didn't know I know who it was.

372
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:21.000
And I opened my eyes and she was she was sitting there really in her form.

373
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:28.000
And. I couldn't speak. I didn't I didn't know what to say.

374
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:36.000
I didn't understand what's going on. But then I started to go to the programs and then also I wanted to know more.

375
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:43.000
I wanted to know the techniques and went everywhere and to France, to Marie Louise.

376
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:48.000
And yeah, it was a very, very difficult beginning.

377
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:53.000
And I just wanted to meet you, Matt. I wanted to see her.

378
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:58.000
But everybody told me, you and you cannot you cannot go.

379
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:04.000
You have to wait one or two years. And I said, no, I don't want to wait that long.

380
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:09.000
So I think it was only we are open. Are you here?

381
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:16.000
And he told me that there will be a pooja in Portugal.

382
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:23.000
And then I said, OK, I want I will go down. And I just went book my ticket.

383
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:29.000
I had no idea about anything. I had no sari. I had nothing.

384
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:37.000
So I went to the airport and many such a yogi's with her waiting and they looked at me.

385
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:43.000
Oh, what are you doing here? I'm going to meet you, Matt.

386
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:52.000
So that was my desire. Very strong. And this connection from the first moment was enormous.

387
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:58.000
And yeah, that was the beginning of my life. And.

388
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:03.000
Yeah, it went strong. It was not always easy.

389
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:09.000
But also in that program, I remember it was a beautiful place in Sintras.

390
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:17.000
And then when you arrived, you might have arrived five minutes later.

391
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:27.000
And from that moment, I had no pain. So already it started. I felt the whole vibration, the vibration in my body working.

392
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:38.000
Even I didn't understand what was going on. And yeah, that was an amazing first meeting.

393
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:50.000
And yeah, I was like a child. I felt like a child. I was joyful and happy and and hungry because I didn't know about the food and not the time.

394
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:57.000
And I didn't understand anything. I was just happy to see Shima to G.

395
00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:08.000
Lovely. It's my first story before. Before I open it up, just generally, I'd like to follow on from that with my story because it's kind of the opposite.

396
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:17.000
So in 1988, I was working on the same floor in Olivetti as Javier Valderrama, who quite a lot of you will know.

397
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:20.000
Oh, yeah. He he.

398
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:30.000
Well, essentially, he just hammered away at me until I finally gave in and agreed to to try to have yoga meditation.

399
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:43.000
And he was so determined that I would that I would try it, that he opened the local center just for me, because the night everybody met, I had karate and I wasn't prepared to give it up at the time.

400
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:50.000
So he took me there and he gave me my realization and then not content with that.

401
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:59.000
A week later, he had me around his house and where Chris and Ruth Greaves were staying at the time while they

402
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:07.000
I think they had to treat the galati ashram where they were living. So he had them work on me.

403
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:24.000
I'm not content with that to another week after that, he picked me up from the airport when I came back from business trip in order to take me to a joint Italian and German pooja Lago di Bryce.

404
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:34.000
So that was my first pooja and a bit like Ken, one of the main things that struck me was all the banks of food.

405
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:43.000
And then, as if that wasn't enough, a month after I got my realization, he brought me to shooting camps for my first pooja with shimashii.

406
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:51.000
And at that pooja shimashii or there was a call for young ladies to go up to young.

407
00:59:51.000 --> 01:00:02.000
I suppose we should say girls, but I was 30. So I'm and one of the girls I knew from the Italian collected grabbed my hand and dragged me up.

408
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:08.000
So my first pooja I found myself decorating shimashii's feet.

409
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:18.000
And I was shown to rub the cum cum into my hands so that my hands were red after we'd finished the pooja to shimashii.

410
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:28.000
And we'd the Italians had to leave early because we had an early flight back to Italy. So everybody, all the others were loath to go.

411
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.000
But we still we had to leave just before they started giving the presents to shimashii.

412
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:49.000
And we got to the airport quite late. So Javier got me with my hands were still red and sent me to the front of the crew queue and said, hold your hands like this to them and tell them we have to get on the plane and that they should let us through now.

413
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
So I did. And they did.

414
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Wow.

415
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Yes.

416
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Now we have to is quite open for anybody who wants to speak.

417
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:20.000
For me, this is always so amazing. The individual stories of each one of us. There is no one which is similar.

418
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.000
It's just to our personality, to our life.

419
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:30.000
From where we came, what we are amazing.

420
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:38.000
It's just so beautiful.

421
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Brigitte, I'm sure you have a multitude of wonderful stories. I don't know whether you feel like relating one of them this evening.

422
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
That's very sweet of you.

423
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000
It's always a pleasure to hear from you. Yeah.

424
01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.000
I'll try to make it short.

425
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Basically, when I was very young, probably seven years old.

426
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.000
I was one morning, looking through the window, it must have been spring.

427
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:25.000
And I felt the presence of God in a very, very strong way, and it was just a feeling of tremendous joy.

428
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:33.000
And I was born in a Catholic family, very, very Catholic.

429
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:40.000
And of course, I went to church and I went through all the process.

430
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:50.000
And I was like, I'm not very happy about what they would say and not do.

431
01:02:50.000 --> 01:03:04.000
So I was imagining that things had to be much simpler, much more available, much more handy, if one can say.

432
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:20.000
And I had heard about gurus, but I had heard also that you cannot choose the guru, but the guru will choose you.

433
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:28.000
So I used to go to Holy Communion, as it is in this Catholic Church.

434
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:44.000
And I would pray, I would be around 12, 13 years old, and I would pray, please, God, send me a guru, because things must be much more simpler than what I hear.

435
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
So time went on.

436
01:03:46.000 --> 01:04:09.000
And now I'm getting to my 23rd year, no, I was 24, when I was invited to a meeting about,

437
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:23.000
a meeting that Gregor gave about his experience in Nepal, where he had been a teacher at university, just after my ex-husband had been.

438
01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:29.000
So we went to that meeting very late, so we were all standing.

439
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:43.000
And by the end of the meeting, where frankly, I didn't hear a word, because I was very much in my listing, leaving to Mexico,

440
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:49.000
maybe three, four days later with my eldest son.

441
01:04:49.000 --> 01:05:01.000
So by the end of his conference, he said, well, I'm over, but I would like to share a very special experience about meditation.

442
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.000
And then my ears went just plunk.

443
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.000
And a lot of people left, so I could sit.

444
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:24.000
And basically, which is quite incredible, he just told us to remove our shoes and put our hands on our lap.

445
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:41.000
And he was just mentioning that you are on a sunny day on a beach and the sun is warm and you're feeling good and you're feeling so relaxed.

446
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:47.000
And that was basically just what he was saying for a certain time.

447
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Probably the yogis behind were trying to raise the Kundalini's.

448
01:05:52.000 --> 01:06:04.000
And after some time, he just mentioned, does somebody feel a kind of a cool breeze in the center of the pond?

449
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.000
And it was obvious.

450
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:13.000
So he said, please, if somebody feels, can you raise your hand?

451
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:21.000
So I raise my hand and he came behind me and he just exploded with joy.

452
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:27.000
She's got it. So I thought, wow, what has happened to me?

453
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Must be something very special. And I did feel the cool breeze, but I had absolutely no clue of what had happened to me.

454
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:52.000
I must say that we left, as I said, in a very short time later after this to Mexico.

455
01:06:52.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Gregor tried to see me just after this conference.

456
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:08.000
He said, well, just take this picture, take it with you.

457
01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:15.000
It's it's too short for me to explain to you right now, but it's very important what has happened.

458
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:23.000
And we left for Mexico. And of course, I had this picture somewhere in my luggage.

459
01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:31.000
But the very interesting thing is that I was really.

460
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Although I didn't believe what people would say, the priests, you know, they would say all sort of things.

461
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:46.000
I was very much I was needing to go to the church, I was needing to pray, I was needing all those things.

462
01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:56.000
And suddenly in Mexico, Mexico is special. I mean, it's it's almost black magic in those in those churches.

463
01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:02.000
I really got completely disgusted with the Catholic Church.

464
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:09.000
And I was a bit desperate to to find something.

465
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:14.000
And I remember one day doing shopping for the house.

466
01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:23.000
I saw a place where they were announcing meditation course.

467
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:30.000
And I remember coming back to that place, entering the hall and feeling.

468
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Weird and just going away again. Anyway, that's here.

469
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:46.000
My second son was born. And after his birth, we suddenly decided to go to Switzerland for Christmas.

470
01:08:46.000 --> 01:09:01.000
And and and then things happen like, you know, they decided that my husband shouldn't start continue working in Mexico, that we would be transferred to Egypt.

471
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000
And I was living with my parents and.

472
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Coming back from Mexico, because I had to pack the house, I see this small little card of Gregor announcing the coming of Sri Mataji in April 1980.

473
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.000
In Lausanne. And frankly, you know.

474
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:38.000
I, I felt such a joy. I mean, today I know what had happened to me, actually, my Kundalini came up.

475
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:50.000
My two children were very young and I had to really get organized to to go to the hotel de la Péa, Lausanne for two nights of conference.

476
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000
But I went there.

477
01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:58.000
I sat right in front.

478
01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:04.000
With all my Catholic conditioning, I was really expecting.

479
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:16.000
To see someone like somebody very thin, sitting almost on nails, you know, very strict and aesthetic.

480
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:37.000
And here comes this beautiful lady in white sari bubbling and so motherly and to really cut the cut the seriousness about it.

481
01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Gregor had done a very big introduction that that time the mics had a big chord and he was speaking and speaking and speaking and finally ended up being tied by the cord.

482
01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:03.000
And he felt right down at the feet of Sri Mataji with an explosion of laughter in the hall and Sri Mataji also.

483
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:11.000
And he said, well, I think I have been speaking for too much time. And it's time that Sri Mataji can speak.

484
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:22.000
The next day, I was very lucky because I could see Sri Mataji in in the flat where she was staying.

485
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:29.000
And one of the questions I asked her was.

486
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Sri Mataji, I had the feeling of the presence of God for.

487
01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Since I was very young.

488
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:50.000
And in the church, we are told that Christ is God. So why don't I feel the same.

489
01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:57.000
The immensity of love and and and and joy.

490
01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000
For Christ, because I mean.

491
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.000
The father and the son is just one one God.

492
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:14.000
So she might have just started working on my hands and by doing Ganesha's symbol and cried cross.

493
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:22.000
On the other hand. And of course, she was doing this famous sound we used to.

494
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:27.000
We have been hearing so often, like, oh, you know, like, oh, it's there, it's there.

495
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.000
But frankly, I didn't feel anything.

496
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:44.000
I finally said yes, because I feel a bit shameful not to to really feel as I was probably supposed to feel.

497
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:53.000
But the beautiful thing is that many years later, maybe three, four years later in Pune.

498
01:12:53.000 --> 01:13:04.000
On the India tour, there was a speech of free managing where I.

499
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:13.000
I was sitting there and fighting, fighting with all my strength not to to sleep away.

500
01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Because the heaviness was so strong on me and suddenly, but I'm not able to really describe what has happened to me.

501
01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:34.000
I can't remember in very precise detail, but I.

502
01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
It was certainly just.

503
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Obvious.

504
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:54.000
And I felt that tremendous unity, maybe, or connection, connection to the to this all pervading love.

505
01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:59.000
But also coming from Christ. So, well, that was a story.

506
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:09.000
There's many more, of course. In April, she might as she was in in Lausanne and in September, she had to come again.

507
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:17.000
And I was really blessed because she she came to the house of my parents.

508
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:24.000
I had done a little trick to my father to have his house by the lake.

509
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:35.000
And she might as she was was there. And we all slept with her in in her room and with a man downstairs.

510
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Do we mean upstairs? And at the conference that night, my father came.

511
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:49.000
And just to to to make it more spicy.

512
01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:57.000
At the end of the talk, she said, tomorrow, I invite you all into my house.

513
01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:09.000
But he said, can you give the address? So my father went bloke because he didn't realize I had organized all that for for streamers.

514
01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:14.000
But that was a wonderful experience. She might.

515
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.000
And Cuba, she goes beautiful. Is the end.

516
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:30.000
It's time is moving on a little bit. I'm aware. But if anybody has another story, it would be wonderful to finish off with.

517
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Mariana Amelia.

518
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:38.000
OK, I was going to propose also Kathy Lantone because it's the first time I do.

519
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Yeah. Yeah. Catchy because it's the first time we are here today. So to be nice that you can introduce yourself because you are from the very, very beginning as well.

520
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:56.000
You're on mute.

521
01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.000
OK, can you hear me? Yes.

522
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:06.000
I'm so happy to be with you and to share all these beautiful stories.

523
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:16.000
And yes, thank you for this opportunity just to to to to tell what was my first experience.

524
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:23.000
And I was knowing Marilor, our sister, since quite a long time.

525
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
I was 14. She was 15.

526
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:33.000
And in the way we could see each other sometimes for our holidays, I was in French, she was in Switzerland.

527
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:38.000
And one day it was in July 1978.

528
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.000
She had already a realization given by Greg.

529
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:49.000
And I went to a studio in Lausanne. She gave me my realization and I was so entangled.

530
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:58.000
You know, it is mundane Maya and all these things mundane things that I could feel something, but certainly not the depth of it.

531
01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000
So one day I went with Greg.

532
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:13.000
I remember my Amelia and I know and Marilor, we went to London and we were very, very lucky because she might actually ask us to come for tea.

533
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:22.000
So we went there. And as I was extremely my liver was so bad that I.

534
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:28.000
When I've seen she might have G, I was absolutely.

535
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Like surprised to see a person so beautiful, so simple.

536
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Her skin was absolutely shining like if it was silk. I was amazed to see such a person like this. So simple, especially simple because I was so much in this mundane things, little bit like you said you know in this Catholic things and everything like this.

537
01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:08.000
And she might actually ask us to see it. We have tea with her. She was speaking so nicely that I could feel her motherhood so much.

538
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:19.000
And suddenly because my liver was so bad, I was feeling extremely cold, but so cold. I was absolutely freezing, freezing, little bit shameful to be like this, but I didn't say anything.

539
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Just she met a geocourse, noticed it.

540
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:27.000
And she just,

541
01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:35.000
she took a show out of her shoulders and put her show and show on my shoulders.

542
01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
And the feeling.

543
01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:43.000
I will never be able to describe what it has been.

544
01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000
It's exactly like if I was

545
01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000
in some lukewarm water.

546
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Wonderful feeling.

547
01:18:52.000 --> 01:19:08.000
I knew that something wonderful was existing I was so bad you know it's this mundane things and suddenly his experience that she might have just been so compassionate to give me otherwise, probably I would never

548
01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.000
been able to find the depth.

549
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:21.000
I knew that something was there, which was wonderful because these feelings that I felt in my inner being was incredible.

550
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:37.000
So I've been very lucky for that. And after that, the day after that I was minus 40 but it was okay. I knew that I could climb the ladder up to something more beautiful.

551
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:54.000
And I will always, always be so grateful to Shonataji because you know compassionate, infinite compassion she gives me this experience, just to know that something absolutely wonderful was there.

552
01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:01.000
So that was my first experience, seeing Shonataji.

553
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:08.000
So beautiful.

554
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000
I remember that visit.

555
01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:19.000
It was incredible. I'm so feeling so, you know, inside, so much.

556
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:34.000
I'm so grateful, just to have been able to feel that because Shonataji knew that otherwise, probably I would have been able to go a little bit further.

557
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:39.000
So it was wonderful, wonderful experience I'm still very moved about that.

558
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:50.000
I'm sorry I'm not going to cry just in front of you like this but it was. Sorry I did also.

559
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000
After so many years we're still moved by it.

560
01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Oh yes, definitely. Definitely.

561
01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:03.000
It has been such a luck for me.

562
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:10.000
And thank you again to give me this opportunity to tell it and it's lovely.

563
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:24.000
And I was very so I'm so happy to hear about you and all your experiences I was, look, I was listening to you and I get and the way everything has been said.

564
01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:33.000
It's so genuine, so honest and it's so beautiful. I must say these difficult times.

565
01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000
It's lovely to hear that.

566
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Thank you so much.

567
01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:56.000
I see Rosemary Maitland, you miss on the crew with us. May the last five minutes she could tell us her story?

568
01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Okay.

569
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Can you hear me? We should have it for the next time because already it's going to be nine o'clock maybe we can have a short meditation and then close at nine o'clock and we are going to meet every month.

570
01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Every second Wednesday of each month.

571
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:30.000
I would love to tell you next time, my little story. Yes. Yes, I would too. I think there's probably a few of us that are watching.

572
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Yeah, me too. I have my story that I would love to tell but it will be another time or so. Yeah, it's been very very uplifting it's a really really nice thing to do.

573
01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Because I'm writing a lot of the stuff down now so it's really really nice to hear how other people have come to Saj yoga and there are similarities actually but yeah, we'll do it.

574
01:22:53.000 --> 01:23:01.000
I'd like to share the American experience what I experienced here in the US. So, another time.

575
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:08.000
I'm making a note of everybody who said that they want to speak.

576
01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Thank you so much.

577
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:19.000
I would have been too shy to say anything if you hadn't mentioned it so thank you so much.

578
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
So lovely to see you.

579
01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:27.000
I'll take my name down for next time as well. Yeah, got it.

580
01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Yes, nine to

581
01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Can you write down the name of Jim and Hillary as well to speak.

582
01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Oh, Jim and Hillary.

583
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Thomas. What about you, Fergie? Oh no I've done, I've done quite a few already so I like I'm enjoying listening to everyone else. Okay.

584
01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:56.000
There are never too many. Come on.

585
01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Maureen. Yes.

586
01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.000
What about you.

587
01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Would you like me to finish up now.

588
01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:14.000
So what do you say Maureen I would like next time, next time, next time.

589
01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:20.000
I think we've got a lot of people who could do next time, maybe the time after.

590
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
After that, absolutely.

591
01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:28.000
But Maureen could you could you, Maureen has just has a couple of announcements to make.

592
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:38.000
And then we'll just finish by a couple of minutes of silence and then raise our Kundalini's and put bandanas on. Indeed, indeed.

593
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:44.000
A huge thank you to all of you who have joined in again this evening.

594
01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:50.000
I think it's pretty obvious that we're all enjoying your stories.

595
01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Hearing about all these different experiences and reliving them with you.

596
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:13.000
And they do bring tears of joy and emotion of all sorts to all of us, so don't be ashamed of the tears they are good tears, if I can put it that way.

597
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:24.000
It's obvious, as I just said that we're going to have a full program next time which will be on the second Wednesday of the month.

598
01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Regularly, there seems to be a good need for it and I think it's a well worthwhile thing to do.

599
01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:40.000
We are also going to propose a WhatsApp group for this group.

600
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Anybody who would like to join it will be invited. I mean, you will all be invited but if you would like to join it, then you're free to do so.

601
01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Instructions will come along in due course.

602
01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:04.000
It's going to be for, we haven't really found a good word for people who had this realization, a long time ago.

603
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:19.000
I don't really like the idea of seniors. No, we changed it already to early, early yogis. Early yogis connect.

604
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Well done Maureen, great idea.

605
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.000
We can name the dinosaurs.

606
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:31.000
I'm sorry I didn't hear. We can name the dinosaurs.

607
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:37.000
I don't like that one.

608
01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:40.000
I don't like elders either.

609
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:50.000
I'm not a yogi personally. Foundation stones. Yogi foundation stones.

610
01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Yes, well, Gary Gary some people felt that was a lot of sort of a lot to live up to.

611
01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:12.000
But you know the roots have to do a lot of work, you know, watch out for a decision on the on the terminology but there will be an invitation to join this WhatsApp group.

612
01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Okay, perhaps I could just finish by pointing out a strange situation.

613
01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Cosmos has arisen out of the pandemic.

614
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Now there's a good thing to think about.

615
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:46.000
When the pandemic started, we were all obviously shut down we could not meet with friends and family, and particularly other yogis we could not go to places where we could meet up with others for meditation or poojas.

616
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:52.000
For some of us, it was extreme or it is still extremely difficult.

617
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
We were isolated.

618
01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:11.000
But thankfully Shalini and some friends I believe thought about this and pulled in people from various places and put them into these little circles, where we meet together six or seven of us maybe.

619
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:19.000
And we talk about problems that we have, joys that we are experiencing, miracles that are happening.

620
01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:32.000
And out of the circles, this group has risen. So this is why I'm saying that COVID has given rise to Cosmos.

621
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Thank you all again for coming this evening, spending time together. What a joy. Thank you.

622
01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Thank you, Maureen. Could I just add, could I just add.

623
01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Yes.

624
01:28:47.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Other than saying a big, big, big heart full thanks to everyone for amazing stories, and just to see you all is amazing. It's a miracle for us to see all of you in one platform.

625
01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:06.000
I would also like to invite, we are also starting sessions for parents.

626
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:17.000
The last two Wednesdays of each month. And I just had a feeling that it is important for parents, especially parents of teenagers to meet each other.

627
01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:28.000
There are so many challenges in that age group for both children and parents. So if you have time, we will send you the invitation. Please join in, bring your experience.

628
01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:42.000
And we'll ask you if, in which way you can contribute, you know, we will have very defined plan sessions. So that is another thing that is coming out of Cosmos. So you all are welcome to join.

629
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Have a lovely evening and a very, very happy day.

630
01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:54.000
And if it wasn't clear from what Maureen said, if anybody wants to join in with Cosmos and join in the circles, we would love to welcome you into them.

631
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Yeah.

632
01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Thanks.

633
01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Sorry, I thought of calling James.

634
01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Sorry.

635
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Okay, I need to go.

636
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Ladies and gentlemen, can we just take our attention. I mean, it already is there but just use our hands to take it, make sure that it's there.

637
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.000
And then raise our Kundalini's and put our hands on.

638
01:30:48.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Thank you.

639
01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Thank you all. Thank you.

640
01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Thank you very much. Thank you.

641
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Good night.

642
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Lots of love.

643
01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Was lovely. Bye bye. It was beautiful. Thank you. Beautiful. Absolutely.

644
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Bye bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye bye everybody.

645
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Bye.

646
01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Hello.

647
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Hi.

648
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Linda.

649
01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Linda. I hope you'll speak from one time as well.

650
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:54.000
I'll try and think of something to say. Oh, I'm sure you'll find something.

651
01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Until Linda It is lovely to see you.

652
01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Thank you.

653
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:07.000
From all around the world.

654
01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Very nice faces.

655
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Difficult to disconnect.

656
01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Hello.

657
01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:31.000
So happy when I heard you coming.

658
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Very nice. First time I do it, but definitely forget what we have found.

659
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:46.000
You know what I mean? With everything that's going on, we just forget, you know, what an amazing thing.

660
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:51.000
We've realized again what an amazing thing it was in our life.

661
01:32:51.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Absolute. Oh my God. I'm going to cry.

662
01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Good to meet all of you.

663
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Yeah.

664
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Bye bye everybody.
