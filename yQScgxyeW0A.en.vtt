33:45.663 --> 33:47.463
I want to introduce to you,

33:48.623 --> 33:51.343
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. Thank you.

34:35.783 --> 34:39.823
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

34:43.423 --> 34:48.663
I explained to you yesterday

34:48.863 --> 34:54.423
that seekers are a special category of human beings,

34:54.743 --> 34:58.743
and they have to first seek their Self.

34:59.463 --> 35:01.383
They are to be blessed first

35:01.623 --> 35:05.703
and then the rest of the world will follow them.

35:06.783 --> 35:11.823
Dr. Warren has explained to you at length

35:11.982 --> 35:15.023
the connection between the gross and the subtle,

35:15.223 --> 35:19.623
how the different centers are related to different plexuses,

35:19.823 --> 35:21.903
very clearly.

35:22.343 --> 35:27.743
When I did my medicine the names of these plexuses were different.

35:27.943 --> 35:30.823
Now they are different,

35:30.982 --> 35:32.743
and every day it is changing

35:32.943 --> 35:36.743
because they are finding new and new things.

35:36.982 --> 35:42.063
But when you get your Self Realization, when you become the Self,

35:42.263 --> 35:45.703
then you don’t live in any relative world.

35:46.263 --> 35:50.183
Today the problem of religions who are fighting among themselves,

35:50.383 --> 35:54.703
like Christians have so many cults, Hindus have so many cults,

35:54.903 --> 35:58.183
Muslims have so many divisions,

35:58.383 --> 36:01.783
this is only because they are understanding God

36:01.982 --> 36:04.982
through their mental projections,

36:05.143 --> 36:09.623
because they are not on absolute state.

36:09.983 --> 36:12.743
When it comes to mental projection

36:12.943 --> 36:17.823
one can go on interpreting the same thing in hundred ways.

36:17.982 --> 36:22.343
Like Bible can be interpreted this way or that way, intellectually.

36:22.983 --> 36:29.063
When you are in the absolute, then absolute is only one.

36:29.703 --> 36:32.143
You cannot have many cults, many interpretations.

36:32.343 --> 36:33.982
There cannot be many.

36:34.143 --> 36:37.983
So when you become the Self, the first thing that happens to you

36:38.183 --> 36:41.943
that you enter into the state of absolute.

36:42.343 --> 36:46.023
Your hands start speaking,

36:46.223 --> 36:48.903
on your fingertips you start feeling it.

36:49.063 --> 36:53.143
It doesn't think, it just gives you the indications.

36:53.623 --> 36:56.823
Supposing you want to find out, is there God?

36:56.983 --> 36:59.103
You have to just put your hands like this,

36:59.303 --> 37:04.863
and ask the question 3 times: “Is there God?”, from your heart.

37:05.023 --> 37:09.982
And you’ll be amazed the vibrations
will be very strong on your hands.

37:11.223 --> 37:14.183
This is the proof that there is God.

37:14.703 --> 37:17.543
The time has come to prove the existence of God,

37:17.743 --> 37:20.982
prove the existence of all-pervading Power.

37:21.183 --> 37:23.463
You turn around to all-pervading Power,

37:23.703 --> 37:26.103
put your hands towards it and ask,

37:26.303 --> 37:30.983
"Is there the power of God which is all-pervading,

37:31.183 --> 37:34.063
which is doing all the living work?

37:34.343 --> 37:37.023
You start getting cool breeze in your hand tremendously.

37:37.223 --> 37:39.783
This is the power for the first time you feel

37:39.982 --> 37:42.663
when you get your Self Realization.

37:42.863 --> 37:46.063
This is the power that does all the living works,

37:46.263 --> 37:48.823
these flowers, they become fruits,

37:48.982 --> 37:52.743
the buds become the flowers, the trees grow.

37:52.982 --> 37:55.183
You have parasympathetic working in you

37:55.383 --> 37:57.303
which is, they call it, autonomous.

37:57.703 --> 38:01.423
But what is auto, who is the auto? That’s the Spirit.

38:01.663 --> 38:06.463
They don’t know what to call it. They have got a name for it,

38:06.783 --> 38:09.823
Exactly the same as it should be, is the auto.

38:09.982 --> 38:12.823
But by giving a name you do not explain what it is.

38:12.982 --> 38:14.183
It is the Spirit.

38:14.383 --> 38:17.423
The Spirit does all the autonomous work within ourselves.

38:17.663 --> 38:21.982
That is the one that works out our parasympathetic.

38:22.143 --> 38:27.023
But still as long as your Spirit is not in your awareness,

38:27.223 --> 38:29.982
as long as it has not come in your attention,

38:30.143 --> 38:34.223
it is just a witness, it is just witnessing what you are doing.

38:34.423 --> 38:37.623
It is looking at.

38:39.303 --> 38:43.223
We have that reflection in your heart.

38:43.423 --> 38:46.823
People who get heart attacks are of two types

38:46.982 --> 38:52.063
one who have lethargic heart and another one who are active heart.

38:52.263 --> 38:54.463
Those who suffer from active hearts,

38:54.703 --> 38:57.703
are the people who are very futuristic, right sided,

38:57.903 --> 39:00.583
who think too much about the future.

39:00.783 --> 39:03.743
And other ones, the ones who have a lethargic heart,

39:03.943 --> 39:08.863
are the people who are left sided, who are very much conditioned,

39:09.023 --> 39:10.663
who are worried about the past,

39:10.863 --> 39:14.903
who live with their ideas of sufferings.

39:15.103 --> 39:19.583
But once the Spirit is awakened within you, it looks after you.

39:19.783 --> 39:23.423
It takes over, and you become a person

39:23.663 --> 39:26.663
who is guided by your Spirit, which is absolute.

39:26.903 --> 39:29.463
And that’s why it explains why

39:29.703 --> 39:32.623
in religion there are so many complications.

39:32.823 --> 39:35.623
Whatever you want to decide through your ego,

39:35.823 --> 39:38.143
through your mental projections, is linear,

39:38.343 --> 39:41.783
It moves in a linear direction and it recoils back.

39:41.982 --> 39:44.983
That’s why you have seen, all human enterprises

39:45.183 --> 39:46.943
have ended up into trouble.

39:47.103 --> 39:49.583
We tried with science, we became

39:49.783 --> 39:52.623
the creators of atom bomb which destroys.

39:52.823 --> 39:56.023
We try with anything, even with emotional side we start.

39:56.223 --> 39:58.583
What we find we get bound to it,

39:58.783 --> 40:02.583
get miseries and troubles in our emotional endeavors also.

40:02.783 --> 40:05.823
So one reaches a point where one realizes

40:05.982 --> 40:11.663
that we have not reached that completion, that epitome,

40:11.863 --> 40:17.743
that highest state where we become knowledgeable to the absolute,

40:17.943 --> 40:20.703
absolute knowledge of everything.

40:21.063 --> 40:24.823
At a human level we know so many things, at absolute level.

40:24.982 --> 40:30.463
Like we know this is a wood. A dog may not know about it.

40:31.223 --> 40:34.783
We know about this, but we do not know whether this wood

40:34.982 --> 40:38.463
has been touched by some saint or not.

40:38.703 --> 40:40.743
We are not sure about it.

40:40.943 --> 40:45.143
We cannot say that is this a holy wood or not?

40:46.863 --> 40:49.063
We cannot make it out. Somebody might say,

40:49.263 --> 40:51.703
“This is the one who was touched by somebody”,

40:51.903 --> 40:54.023
somebody might say “No, how can you say that?”

40:54.223 --> 40:57.463
There’s no way of deciding what is the truth

40:57.703 --> 41:00.982
because you are not at the state of absolute.

41:01.223 --> 41:05.103
All your theories that are prevalent

41:05.303 --> 41:08.023
like you say capitalism, communism,

41:08.223 --> 41:12.263
all these “-ism" that we talk of, are also relative.

41:12.982 --> 41:16.023
For example, if I say “I am the greatest capitalist”.

41:16.223 --> 41:19.982
Supposing I have all the powers, then I am the greatest capitalist.

41:20.143 --> 41:21.943
But I am the greatest communist

41:22.103 --> 41:25.823
because I cannot live with them, I have to share with all of you,

41:25.982 --> 41:29.343
I have to move about, I have to travel and travel and travel,

41:29.623 --> 41:31.303
that I should share with all of you.

41:31.463 --> 41:36.063
I cannot enjoy it alone, so I’m the greatest communist as well.

41:36.263 --> 41:38.703
All the theories that we have in your minds

41:38.903 --> 41:41.383
have come out of the unconscious

41:41.623 --> 41:43.383
to create that gross part of it.

41:43.663 --> 41:46.023
Like people talk of United Nations.

41:46.223 --> 41:50.583
United Nations seems to be a myth, if you face it.

41:50.783 --> 41:53.303
You can’t understand this kind of a United Nations

41:53.463 --> 41:55.982
where everybody’s pulling each other’s legs,

41:56.143 --> 41:59.743
There’s a problem on how many jobs should be given to whom,

41:59.943 --> 42:03.743
how much pay, and everything dealing on very gross levels.

42:04.063 --> 42:08.383
But you see that when you become

42:08.623 --> 42:11.823
a realized soul - there are 14 nations now,

42:11.982 --> 42:14.823
were representing, were represented in India,

42:14.982 --> 42:17.823
and all of them if you have seen, very happy people,

42:17.982 --> 42:21.463
extremely joyous, such friendship, such enjoyment

42:21.703 --> 42:24.903
and a little bit of fun,

42:25.063 --> 42:27.943
of ragging each other sometimes, pulling each other’s legs,

42:28.103 --> 42:30.663
and then again enjoying and mirth

42:30.863 --> 42:34.543
real enjoyment. No quarreling, no fighting,

42:34.743 --> 42:38.023
no question of race, nothing of the kind.

42:38.383 --> 42:43.143
This kind of the new race has to be evolved out of the people.

42:43.943 --> 42:45.463
So this is what happens to you,

42:45.703 --> 42:47.943
that you reach the state of absolute.

42:48.103 --> 42:50.143
So there cannot be cults in Sahaja Yoga,

42:50.343 --> 42:52.743
there cannot be a division of ideas,

42:52.943 --> 42:54.863
there cannot be any interpretations,

42:55.023 --> 42:57.823
because it is so much within you.

42:57.983 --> 43:01.743
Now the subjective and objective, we call it in a way, funny way.

43:01.943 --> 43:04.463
For us, objective is whatever is gross outside

43:04.703 --> 43:07.143
and subjective is something arbitrary.

43:07.343 --> 43:09.183
But once you become a realized soul,

43:09.383 --> 43:11.383
you become really the subjective.

43:11.903 --> 43:14.743
You really become the subjective, in the sense your subject acts,

43:14.943 --> 43:16.903
but which is an absolute subject.

43:17.063 --> 43:20.703
So everybody has that absolute within themselves.

43:21.783 --> 43:24.903
Self is the universal being within yourself

43:25.063 --> 43:29.063
Is the universal being and that is in everyone.

43:29.263 --> 43:32.943
It relates to the same, it’s an universal truth.

43:33.103 --> 43:36.023
So you cannot have two opinions about it.

43:36.223 --> 43:38.303
There’s no question of having opinions

43:38.463 --> 43:40.263
because it is so, it's a fact.

43:40.623 --> 43:42.583
And whatever is the fact, that you accept.

43:42.783 --> 43:44.983
So the Spirit is the truth.

43:45.183 --> 43:47.383
There's no other way to find out the truth.

43:47.623 --> 43:49.183
Anything you want to find out,

43:49.383 --> 43:51.823
you have to find out through your vibrations,

43:51.982 --> 43:56.982
which is the blessing of your Self Realization.

43:57.263 --> 44:00.703
Without Self Realization, there is diversity.

44:00.903 --> 44:02.983
You find people are so diverse.

44:03.183 --> 44:06.103
They are contradictive, they fight each other,

44:06.303 --> 44:10.063
they have such problems, that have no solutions.

44:10.263 --> 44:13.743
They live like parallel lines where they never meet.

44:13.943 --> 44:16.743
But suddenly you find all these parallel lines meet

44:16.943 --> 44:18.823
at the South Pole or the North Pole.

44:18.983 --> 44:21.543
In the same way, they meet

44:21.743 --> 44:24.783
at the same point, what we call the Spirit.

44:24.982 --> 44:29.943
At that times you have no problems, solving your problems,

44:30.103 --> 44:34.343
because there is no problem left, you are beyond it.

44:34.783 --> 44:37.343
Truth is something that exists, that is there.

44:37.663 --> 44:39.623
You cannot challenge it, it is so.

44:39.823 --> 44:42.463
Supposing a person is a devil,

44:42.703 --> 44:46.103
and you are following a devil as a guru, for example.

44:46.303 --> 44:48.982
Now you may argue out with Me, whatever you may do,

44:49.143 --> 44:50.823
but devil is a devil.

44:50.982 --> 44:54.623
You cannot get good vibrations from such a person.

44:54.823 --> 44:57.583
But supposing he’s a human being half backed,

44:57.783 --> 44:59.823
just little bit lost or something,

44:59.983 --> 45:03.463
such a person definitely, has a chance of transformation.

45:03.703 --> 45:05.982
But the one who is a hard boiled,

45:06.143 --> 45:08.943
horrible fellow like Hitler, how can you change him?

45:09.103 --> 45:13.103
He cannot be changed. So forget about him, just forget about him.

45:13.303 --> 45:14.823
He doesn’t exist for us.

45:14.982 --> 45:17.823
You are not to bother about such hard boiled people.

45:17.982 --> 45:21.983
But you develop a kind of a discreet wisdom,

45:22.183 --> 45:26.663
as it is in the little cell, at the tip of a root.

45:26.863 --> 45:31.343
How it penetrates to its own source and keeps to it

45:31.703 --> 45:35.982
following slowly through the soft parts of the earth

45:36.143 --> 45:38.263
and how it reaches the source.

45:38.623 --> 45:39.823
In the same way,

45:39.982 --> 45:44.263
you too develop that kind of a beautiful, innocent wisdom.

45:44.463 --> 45:49.023
Innocence is the source of wisdom, that’s the source of wisdom.

45:49.223 --> 45:52.383
If you have innocence, you become extremely wise.

45:52.623 --> 45:57.623
You have discretion, you have sense of direction,

45:57.823 --> 45:59.623
even gross direction.

45:59.823 --> 46:02.743
A person whose innocence is intact,

46:02.943 --> 46:07.223
he can immediately tell you what is right, what is wrong.

46:07.423 --> 46:09.223
Not only that, but
he can tell you

46:09.423 --> 46:12.783
what is east, west, north and south.

46:13.103 --> 46:17.023
Because he acts like a magnet, there’s a magnet in that person

46:17.223 --> 46:21.783
and he becomes a magnetic personality because of his innocence.

46:21.982 --> 46:25.103
You see, a child attracts the whole crowd,

46:25.303 --> 46:28.823
a child is such a beautiful thing because it is innocent.

46:28.982 --> 46:30.543
But the devilish part of it

46:30.743 --> 46:34.863
that nowadays we are busy attacking even that,

46:35.023 --> 46:36.823
the child’s innocence.

46:36.982 --> 46:40.903
So be careful that we preserve our innocence

46:41.063 --> 46:43.983
and respect the innocence outside.

46:45.023 --> 46:50.183
This Spirit when it manifests, it also gives you a state

46:50.383 --> 46:52.823
which we call as collective consciousness.

46:53.063 --> 46:57.583
Is the state by which you become you, again I say become

46:57.783 --> 46:59.943
- it's actualization, it is not just talking -

47:00.103 --> 47:02.383
you become conscious collective,

47:02.623 --> 47:03.783
means you become

47:03.982 --> 47:07.383
conscious of another person's centers on your fingertips.

47:07.623 --> 47:10.303
You also become Self aware,

47:10.543 --> 47:11.943
you know about yourself,

47:12.103 --> 47:14.983
what centers are catching, where are we going.

47:15.183 --> 47:20.423
Like a person who becomes mentally upset, he doesn’t know,

47:20.663 --> 47:21.783
really becomes mad,

47:21.982 --> 47:25.023
goes to lunatic asylum and dies, he does not know.

47:25.223 --> 47:27.982
But in Sahaja Yoga immediately you can find out

47:28.143 --> 47:31.303
that there’s something going wrong with your mental side.

47:31.863 --> 47:33.743
If a person gets into cancer,

47:33.943 --> 47:38.982
he might get, gets into the state of galloping cancer, about to die,

47:39.143 --> 47:41.183
then he may discover that he has got cancer.

47:41.463 --> 47:43.743
But in Sahaja Yoga if there’s a little imbalance,

47:43.943 --> 47:47.663
immediately it shows on your fingertips, and if you know

47:47.863 --> 47:53.303
how to do it, how to correct it, then every problem is solved.

47:53.623 --> 47:57.143
So as I told you yesterday, yoga has double meaning.

47:57.343 --> 48:00.383
Yoga means union with the Divine, that’s one.

48:00.623 --> 48:04.063
and the second one is the expertise, the depthness,

48:04.263 --> 48:06.063
what we call in Sanskrit kaushalam.

48:06.263 --> 48:07.943
You must have a depthness,

48:08.103 --> 48:11.543
how to handle this all-pervading Power that is flowing through us,

48:11.743 --> 48:15.063
how to understand ourselves, how to understand others,

48:15.263 --> 48:19.183
that’s an important part of Sahaja Yoga.

48:19.383 --> 48:22.903
First of al a little light is enlightened.

48:23.063 --> 48:25.943
You get the experience of the Spirit to begin with.

48:26.103 --> 48:27.823
It's an actualization.

48:27.982 --> 48:30.543
But then you must make it grow.

48:30.743 --> 48:33.343
Christ has given beautiful parables

48:33.663 --> 48:36.223
explaining this, the sprouting of the seeds,

48:36.423 --> 48:38.823
which were thrown on the rocks,

48:38.982 --> 48:43.143
some were thrown in the good soil and somewhere neglected.

48:43.343 --> 48:45.863
And we find that everyday happening.

48:46.023 --> 48:48.823
Thousands come to My program and then I find

48:48.982 --> 48:50.982
some of them are lost in the rocks,

48:51.143 --> 48:53.063
some of them are wasted,

48:53.263 --> 48:55.823
but some of them become huge big trees

48:55.982 --> 48:59.183
to give shade, joy and support to others.

48:59.383 --> 49:01.103
We have to change this world.

49:01.303 --> 49:04.183
How are we going to change this world, this horrible world

49:04.383 --> 49:08.143
which is just under precipices of destruction?

49:08.343 --> 49:11.183
The only way is that we have to change ourselves.

49:11.383 --> 49:14.383
That’s the transformation just waiting to happen.

49:14.623 --> 49:16.383
It's nothing that I am doing about you,

49:16.623 --> 49:18.943
I really tell you, I don’t do anything.

49:19.103 --> 49:22.463
I don’t do anything, I’m just waiting to get it.

49:22.703 --> 49:24.743
You just catch upon it and you get it.

49:24.943 --> 49:28.303
I’m maybe just triggering it, but you can trigger it also.

49:28.463 --> 49:32.743
So one has to understand that you have to be honest to yourself,

49:32.943 --> 49:34.623
you have to be fair to yourself.

49:34.823 --> 49:37.743
You have to understand your value, you must know your worth,

49:37.943 --> 49:39.982
that you are a human being created

49:40.143 --> 49:43.383
out of small things like amoeba, from carbon,

49:43.623 --> 49:45.903
and today you are sitting here as human beings,

49:46.063 --> 49:48.063
you must be something very special.

49:48.263 --> 49:51.143
And this special thing has to become that thing

49:51.343 --> 49:53.943
which will make you understand what you are.

49:54.103 --> 49:56.143
Only thing you are not yet connected.

49:56.343 --> 50:01.103
Only thing is that you have not yet felt that divinity within you.

50:01.303 --> 50:03.783
We are all potentially divine.

50:03.982 --> 50:06.303
We have to just feel that divinity within us.

50:06.463 --> 50:10.543
But as a result of that, you are such a powerful personality,

50:10.743 --> 50:12.383
power of love.

50:12.623 --> 50:15.583
We have never used the power of love,

50:15.783 --> 50:18.463
We have only used the power of hatred so far.

50:18.703 --> 50:22.023
Power of love is much above power of hatred.

50:22.223 --> 50:26.543
It can angle all hatred, can just

50:26.743 --> 50:29.143
suck in everything that is hatred.

50:29.343 --> 50:32.703
It’s very simple. Very simple methods are to be put,

50:32.903 --> 50:35.823
only you must have desire to get transformed.

50:36.943 --> 50:40.343
Now the third thing that happens with Self Realization

50:40.663 --> 50:47.423
is that you get a state of peace, of bliss and of joy.

50:48.982 --> 50:52.903
When the Kundalini rises above this Agnya chakra

50:53.063 --> 50:55.743
you become thoughtlessly aware.

50:55.943 --> 50:59.303
It's called as Nirvichara Samadhi. Thoughtlessly aware,

50:59.463 --> 51:01.543
when there is no thought in your mind.

51:01.743 --> 51:03.383
If you want, you can think.

51:03.623 --> 51:05.943
If you want you can think, but if you don’t want,

51:06.103 --> 51:08.663
you can be in that state when you don’t think.

51:08.863 --> 51:10.623
Actually it’s maddening sometimes

51:10.823 --> 51:14.463
the way man is thinking morning till evening,

51:14.703 --> 51:18.583
yarns after yarns, useless things, a joyless pursuit.

51:18.783 --> 51:22.982
But when this thinking stops, you are above the thoughts.

51:23.383 --> 51:26.623
I would say to give it a similitude,

51:26.823 --> 51:30.263
that the waves of thought come and go away.

51:30.623 --> 51:32.863
Another thought comes and goes away.

51:33.023 --> 51:36.983
We are jumping on the cusp of the thought all the time

51:37.183 --> 51:43.183
Supposing we can just get

51:43.383 --> 51:47.303
in the center of the thought,

51:47.463 --> 51:49.823
that is the present.

51:49.982 --> 51:53.863
If we can, could stop at the present moment,

51:54.023 --> 51:56.063
then we are not worried about the thoughts.

51:56.263 --> 51:58.903
Like the waves of water, if you are in the waves,

51:59.063 --> 52:00.703
you are frightened of that.

52:00.903 --> 52:02.823
But supposing you are in a boat

52:02.983 --> 52:06.623
then you can see the waves and enjoy them.

52:06.823 --> 52:09.063
In the same way what happens to you

52:09.263 --> 52:15.663
that you jump up to a higher state of existence

52:15.863 --> 52:20.303
through which you see the thoughts

52:20.703 --> 52:23.983
if you want, you don’t want to see you can, you need not see.

52:24.183 --> 52:29.423
Now the thoughts that you see also, are very wide and deeper

52:29.663 --> 52:31.583
where you get inspirations.

52:31.783 --> 52:34.583
That’s why, as Dr. Warren has told you,

52:34.783 --> 52:37.383
that your creativity improves.

52:37.623 --> 52:40.943
You can become tremendously dynamic.

52:41.103 --> 52:43.623
Because your time is not wasted in wasteful things.

52:43.823 --> 52:45.943
You just know this is it.

52:46.103 --> 52:49.143
This is the exact, this is what we have to do.

52:49.623 --> 52:52.103
And that’s how people get rid of

52:52.303 --> 52:55.143
many of their problems of mental tensions.

52:55.343 --> 52:58.823
There’s no tension at all. You don’t have any worries.

52:58.983 --> 53:01.983
You just see the thing like the witness.

53:02.183 --> 53:04.823
You become the witness of the whole drama.

53:04.982 --> 53:06.223
When you are in the drama,

53:06.423 --> 53:08.823
you think you are a part and parcel of the drama

53:08.983 --> 53:11.143
sometimes you weep with it and cry with it.

53:11.343 --> 53:14.583
But when the drama is over, you realize it was just a drama.

53:14.783 --> 53:15.863
“I was not there”.

53:16.023 --> 53:17.783
In the same way it happens to you,

53:17.982 --> 53:20.103
that you achieve a witness state.

53:20.303 --> 53:24.263
It happens to you. Even if you want to get involved, you cannot.

53:24.463 --> 53:25.903
You just cannot get it.

53:26.063 --> 53:28.063
That’s how you can solve the problems better

53:28.263 --> 53:30.103
because you are away from the problems.

53:30.303 --> 53:32.982
You can see what the problem is, but when you are in it,

53:33.143 --> 53:37.103
you are upset, full of tension, worries,

53:37.303 --> 53:40.703
and sometimes people get so upset with it

53:40.903 --> 53:43.703
that they commit suicides, when they find no solution.

53:43.903 --> 53:45.663
But if you are away from it,

53:45.863 --> 53:49.303
then you can definitely solve the problem.

53:50.023 --> 53:52.743
Now this witness state has to grow within you

53:52.943 --> 53:57.863
gradually, with little understanding and with little meditation,

53:58.023 --> 54:01.143
which is very simple, which you can do very easily.

54:01.343 --> 54:03.423
Nothing has to be done about.

54:03.663 --> 54:06.383
But first thing you must know, it is actualization,

54:06.623 --> 54:09.943
it is not your mental projection that is going to do anything.

54:10.103 --> 54:14.103
Like we may say, "we are all brothers and sisters". We say so.

54:14.903 --> 54:17.743
But when it comes to wars, we become enemies.

54:17.943 --> 54:20.823
Even in a family there are brothers and sisters,

54:20.982 --> 54:23.463
when it comes to property, they fight.

54:23.703 --> 54:27.663
Not in Sahaja Yoga. You really become part and parcel of each other.

54:27.863 --> 54:29.863
You feel the another person within yourself.

54:30.023 --> 54:31.903
That’s how the collective consciousness

54:32.063 --> 54:35.183
just comes into your central nervous system.

54:35.383 --> 54:37.183
That’s what it is, you have to feel it

54:37.383 --> 54:39.303
on your central nervous system.

54:39.623 --> 54:42.423
This is the word used by Buddha,

54:42.663 --> 54:44.823
which he calls as Bodha.

54:44.982 --> 54:48.663
Bodha means that you feel on your central nervous system.

54:48.943 --> 54:50.743
Even Vedas means "Vidh".

54:50.943 --> 54:53.023
"Vidh" means on the central nervous system.

54:53.223 --> 54:54.823
It is not in your brain

54:54.982 --> 54:57.863
because whatever you know in your brain is so limited,

54:58.023 --> 55:02.703
and can be changed, converted, brought to another view.

55:02.943 --> 55:06.823
but whatever you have known through your central nervous system,

55:06.982 --> 55:09.703
is the actual thing, is the actual fact,

55:09.903 --> 55:12.663
which you cannot contradict,

55:12.863 --> 55:15.823
you cannot diversify and you cannot challenge it.

55:15.982 --> 55:18.343
It is so, so it is.

55:19.023 --> 55:20.423
So one has to accept

55:20.743 --> 55:23.663
when you become the Spirit, that you are the Spirit.

55:23.863 --> 55:27.263
That’s one of the things people cannot accept easily.

55:27.463 --> 55:29.303
They cannot assume.

55:29.463 --> 55:31.983
I’ve seen so many yogis who become yogis

55:32.183 --> 55:34.103
but they are so humble, so simple.

55:34.383 --> 55:36.982
Some of these gurus are so fake, horrible,

55:37.143 --> 55:40.383
they don’t know anything about God, anything about Spirit.

55:40.703 --> 55:44.703
They are nowhere near it, they are just money-oriented enterprisers,

55:44.903 --> 55:47.303
come down and big, talk so big,

55:47.463 --> 55:50.103
create such huge big organizations.

55:50.343 --> 55:52.143
As Dr. Warren was telling Me, “Mother,

55:52.343 --> 55:54.343
people have to sell their mortgages,

55:54.623 --> 55:56.823
put everything into mortgages,

55:56.982 --> 55:59.863
sell of everything to become the disciples of these gurus.”

56:00.023 --> 56:03.303
All these absurd things they do

56:03.623 --> 56:05.743
without knowing anything about God,

56:05.943 --> 56:08.263
without knowing anything about the Spirit.

56:08.823 --> 56:12.183
All that is done and why you are a yogi now.

56:12.463 --> 56:16.023
You are the one who has achieved that state of yoga

56:16.223 --> 56:19.103
and still you do not feel that way.

56:19.303 --> 56:22.423
You become absolutely humble.

56:22.863 --> 56:25.823
You do not feel that you are a yogi,

56:25.982 --> 56:29.263
you are a great person, because it becomes your nature.

56:29.463 --> 56:34.303
When it is your nature, you do not assume anything, it is there,

56:34.463 --> 56:36.823
it's not a false assumption but it’s a fact.

56:36.982 --> 56:39.663
So there’s nothing to be proud of,

56:39.863 --> 56:41.903
there’s nothing to be thinking

56:42.063 --> 56:44.103
that you are doing something good to others,

56:44.303 --> 56:46.823
It is something that you are doing out of your own nature,

56:46.982 --> 56:48.063
nothing so special.

56:48.263 --> 56:51.103
As some people thank Me very much sometimes, I’m surprised,

56:51.303 --> 56:53.743
because I’m doing nothing I know. I do nothing.

56:53.943 --> 56:55.623
It's just flowing through Me,

56:55.823 --> 57:00.143
I’m just watching it working out, but I’m doing nothing,

57:00.343 --> 57:04.143
I’m not working out anything. It’s just working out by itself.

57:04.343 --> 57:08.703
So when you achieve that state, you become a humble personality,

57:08.903 --> 57:13.623
extremely humble, because you see that others are still blind,

57:13.823 --> 57:16.263
they haven’t seen the light, they are suffering so much.

57:16.463 --> 57:18.903
You are filled with such compassion and understanding.

57:19.063 --> 57:21.303
Sometimes they try to be very harsh with you,

57:21.463 --> 57:24.623
sometimes they try to bash you, trouble you, do everything.

57:24.823 --> 57:27.743
But the compassion is so great because you know they are children,

57:27.943 --> 57:30.383
they are stupid, they cannot see, doesn’t matter.

57:30.623 --> 57:31.743
Let us work it out.

57:31.943 --> 57:33.183
And that’s how you work it

57:33.383 --> 57:37.543
in such a compassionate, affectionate and kindly way

57:37.743 --> 57:42.103
And temper you do not get into, what you get into is a compassion.

57:42.303 --> 57:45.903
Sometimes, of course, you have to make a drama of a temper,

57:46.103 --> 57:48.863
just to make people all right, but just a drama.

57:49.023 --> 57:52.703
Inside you are all peaceful. There’s complete peace within yourself.

57:52.903 --> 57:56.023
Because your Spirit is the source of peace.

57:56.223 --> 57:58.743
We talk of peace outside,

57:58.943 --> 58:04.703
we organize big, big organizations

58:04.903 --> 58:07.663
to have seminars on peace,

58:07.943 --> 58:10.703
have conferences of peace, representatives of peace,

58:10.903 --> 58:13.183
all fighting within themselves and without.

58:13.383 --> 58:16.103
We are all the time fighting with ourselves.

58:16.303 --> 58:21.143
We like something physically, then the mind says “No”,

58:21.343 --> 58:23.623
then the stomach says “Yes”.

58:23.823 --> 58:26.303
There’s a fight going on between ourselves.

58:26.623 --> 58:29.823
But when you become a realized soul,

58:29.982 --> 58:32.623
the fight outside and inside is finished,

58:32.823 --> 58:35.823
Because inside you get completely integrated.

58:35.982 --> 58:40.703
The last center is the center of Sahasrara, we call it,

58:40.903 --> 58:42.943
because there are thousand petals.

58:43.103 --> 58:45.982
Thousand petals because there are thousand nerves

58:46.143 --> 58:47.703
which get enlightened.

58:47.903 --> 58:51.343
And the light from the flame as you see in a candle,

58:51.663 --> 58:54.743
in the same way it appears like tongues of flames,

58:54.943 --> 58:57.703
beautiful tongues of flames of various colors,

58:57.903 --> 58:59.783
you see them opening out.

58:59.982 --> 59:02.623
First you don’t see, first you become the light

59:02.823 --> 59:05.623
and then you can see it also that it opens out

59:05.823 --> 59:10.943
as a beautiful lotus, of flames of beautiful colors.

59:11.103 --> 59:13.583
And you stand in between to see

59:13.783 --> 59:17.823
that you are there watching all these within yourself.

59:17.982 --> 59:22.463
This center has a specialty, that all the centers you have seen

59:22.743 --> 59:27.303
the six centers, are placed in the head.

59:27.623 --> 59:31.863
This is what we call the station of the centers or the Pithas.

59:32.023 --> 59:33.823
Those centers are working there

59:33.982 --> 59:36.863
but actually their guarding forces are in the head.

59:37.023 --> 59:40.982
And when the Kundalini comes up and she integrates you

59:41.143 --> 59:44.783
and enlightens the brain, all these centers also get enlightened.

59:44.982 --> 59:48.823
and you feel that you are completely integrated.

59:48.982 --> 59:51.623
Your mind, your body, your soul,

59:51.823 --> 59:53.943
all work together, there's no fight.

59:54.103 --> 59:57.663
You are extremely restful, you are peaceful

59:57.863 --> 01:00:03.103
and the bliss you feel actually, actually as physical manifestation.

01:00:03.303 --> 01:00:06.983
For example, if you want to see something very beautiful,

01:00:07.183 --> 01:00:10.383
you see something very beautiful and you like it.

01:00:10.703 --> 01:00:13.823
Like Mona Lisa’s painting, now many people go to see that.

01:00:13.982 --> 01:00:16.823
They don’t know what they like about it, but I know what it is.

01:00:16.983 --> 01:00:21.063
When you watch that, there’s no thought, there’s no thought.

01:00:21.263 --> 01:00:22.703
When there is no thought,

01:00:22.903 --> 01:00:25.823
the creation of the artist in that photograph

01:00:25.982 --> 01:00:27.663
or in that painting

01:00:27.863 --> 01:00:30.743
or in any beautiful scene or anything that you see,

01:00:30.943 --> 01:00:33.623
the whole thing is reflected within you,

01:00:33.823 --> 01:00:38.663
as if it’s a rippleless ocean,

01:00:38.863 --> 01:00:40.823
or a rippleless lake

01:00:40.982 --> 01:00:44.103
in which all the surroundings are reflected completely.

01:00:44.303 --> 01:00:46.743
And then you feel actually physically

01:00:46.943 --> 01:00:50.023
as if the joy and the peace is flowing down you

01:00:50.223 --> 01:00:51.823
like peaceful happening.

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:54.583
You feel that relaxation just coming on you.

01:00:54.783 --> 01:00:58.063
Physically also you feel it and you feel extremely charmed by that.

01:00:58.263 --> 01:01:02.982
But this feeling is only evident when you are a realized soul.

01:01:03.143 --> 01:01:04.703
Before that it hasn’t effect,

01:01:04.903 --> 01:01:06.823
that’s why you have seen all such things

01:01:06.982 --> 01:01:08.623
which are of eternal beauty

01:01:08.823 --> 01:01:11.343
are all those who give you vibrations.

01:01:11.623 --> 01:01:13.423
There have been many great people,

01:01:13.663 --> 01:01:15.903
artists who have been realized souls.

01:01:16.063 --> 01:01:17.943
I would say Mozart was a realized soul.

01:01:18.263 --> 01:01:19.982
There are many artists,

01:01:20.143 --> 01:01:23.663
we can say Sistine Chapel done by Michelangelo -

01:01:23.863 --> 01:01:25.703
Michelangelo himself was a realized soul.

01:01:25.903 --> 01:01:28.743
The way he has put Christ there -

01:01:28.943 --> 01:01:31.423
Christ was like that, a huge, big personality

01:01:31.663 --> 01:01:33.823
like an Australian you can say,

01:01:33.982 --> 01:01:35.943
huge, big personality standing there,

01:01:36.103 --> 01:01:38.463
bestrewing people to the right and the left.

01:01:38.703 --> 01:01:41.063
And the whole Sistine Chapel is nothing but the Kundalini.

01:01:41.263 --> 01:01:43.823
And He is standing at the Agnya. If you see it clear, it is so.

01:01:43.982 --> 01:01:46.183
And is strewing people on this side and that side

01:01:46.383 --> 01:01:48.823
with that mighty body of His.

01:01:48.982 --> 01:01:51.383
He has to be a man of a mighty body

01:01:51.623 --> 01:01:55.903
and of a very healthy appearance.

01:01:56.063 --> 01:01:58.823
While just below the Sistine Chapel,

01:01:58.983 --> 01:02:03.023
I saw a miserable looking, bony Christ,

01:02:03.223 --> 01:02:09.703
just like a TB patient put there on the table, by this pope.

01:02:09.982 --> 01:02:12.183
I was just amazed.

01:02:12.703 --> 01:02:16.863
Ask these popes to carry the cross.

01:02:17.023 --> 01:02:20.663
Even for two minutes they cannot carry it.

01:02:20.903 --> 01:02:24.303
With that kind of a miserable body can you carry a cross?

01:02:24.463 --> 01:02:26.982
I don’t know what is the sadism behind it,

01:02:27.143 --> 01:02:29.423
to show Christ in that miserable state.

01:02:29.743 --> 01:02:33.343
Just to show that we have to be miserable like Christ.

01:02:33.623 --> 01:02:35.543
When we talk of Christ

01:02:35.743 --> 01:02:38.903
we must know He said that, you are not to suffer anymore.

01:02:39.063 --> 01:02:40.823
Still there are many people they say:

01:02:40.982 --> 01:02:43.463
“Oh, we must suffer because Christ has suffered”.

01:02:43.703 --> 01:02:45.223
What can you suffer from Him?

01:02:45.423 --> 01:02:49.063
The amount of sufferings He had, you cannot suffer any more.

01:02:49.263 --> 01:02:52.143
He has suffered for you. Now it is for you to enjoy.

01:02:52.343 --> 01:02:56.063
He suffered for you so that He resides in Agnya chakra

01:02:56.263 --> 01:02:59.023
and He sucks in your ego and superego,

01:02:59.223 --> 01:03:02.143
He sucks in all your karmas and sins whatever are there,

01:03:02.343 --> 01:03:05.943
so you enter into the Kingdom of God to enjoy the citizenship,

01:03:06.103 --> 01:03:11.023
to enjoy the benevolence, to enjoy the blessings of God almighty.

01:03:11.623 --> 01:03:17.423
I must say the Divine is so anxious that you should enter into it.

01:03:17.743 --> 01:03:21.663
In these modern times even to talk about God is an impossibility.

01:03:21.863 --> 01:03:25.103
But we can prove the existence of God now within ourselves

01:03:25.303 --> 01:03:28.982
and we can show the All-pervading Power that exists.

01:03:29.463 --> 01:03:31.943
It is for us to turn round a little,

01:03:32.103 --> 01:03:36.223
to stop making everything mechanical,

01:03:36.423 --> 01:03:38.623
to know that there exists,

01:03:38.823 --> 01:03:41.823
the greatest power of greatest that we cannot handle.

01:03:41.982 --> 01:03:43.703
We cannot do any living work.

01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:47.063
That living work which is done by this all-pervading Power,

01:03:47.263 --> 01:03:50.063
which is called in Sanskrit as Ritambhara Pragya.

01:03:50.263 --> 01:03:52.743
In the Patanjali’s Yoga Shastra,

01:03:52.943 --> 01:03:55.143
he has called it as Ritambhara Pragya.

01:03:55.343 --> 01:03:58.383
There are different names in different religions,

01:03:58.623 --> 01:04:00.863
like in Islam they call it Ruh,

01:04:01.023 --> 01:04:05.303
Chaitanya, Logas, all kinds of names they have given to this.

01:04:05.463 --> 01:04:08.783
But they were aware of this great power

01:04:08.982 --> 01:04:11.703
that surrounds us and does all the living work.

01:04:11.982 --> 01:04:17.023
So we also become in charge of that, we become experts on that.

01:04:17.303 --> 01:04:19.623
I give you a simple example,

01:04:19.823 --> 01:04:25.863
that as you have in the car a break and an accelerator,

01:04:26.023 --> 01:04:28.303
we have the left and the right side.

01:04:28.463 --> 01:04:31.663
We make mistakes when we are learning how to drive.

01:04:31.863 --> 01:04:34.823
We sometimes put the accelerator, sometimes a break,

01:04:34.983 --> 01:04:37.223
then gradually we master it,

01:04:37.423 --> 01:04:40.583
and we become an expert. Then we’ll start doing it automatically.

01:04:40.783 --> 01:04:42.543
That’s how we become the driver.

01:04:42.743 --> 01:04:47.223
But Self Realization is the thing where you become the master.

01:04:47.982 --> 01:04:51.463
The master is sitting behind and watching the driver,

01:04:51.743 --> 01:04:57.343
the left and the right, the break and the accelerator in himself

01:04:57.663 --> 01:04:59.982
and managing it nicely without doing anything.

01:05:00.183 --> 01:05:03.103
That’s what is Self-Realization and that has to happen.

01:05:03.303 --> 01:05:05.982
Then there is a balance automatically achieved,

01:05:06.143 --> 01:05:08.023
you don’t have to do anything about it.

01:05:08.263 --> 01:05:10.863
In the beginning also

01:05:11.023 --> 01:05:14.463
you may have to work. I wouldn’t say, but many people

01:05:14.703 --> 01:05:17.823
I have seen, they just get Realization and are there.

01:05:18.063 --> 01:05:20.023
So this is the first state where you reach

01:05:20.223 --> 01:05:23.703
what we call the thoughtless awareness.

01:05:23.903 --> 01:05:25.903
And then the second is Nirvikalpa,

01:05:26.063 --> 01:05:29.943
where you become doubtlessly aware, you become an expert.

01:05:30.103 --> 01:05:35.423
You don’t have to even talk about it, it can work out.

01:05:35.863 --> 01:05:38.103
That’s what is the state we have to achieve.

01:05:38.423 --> 01:05:40.743
So you become the source of joy.

01:05:40.943 --> 01:05:46.063
Joy is a thing beyond happiness and unhappiness

01:05:46.303 --> 01:05:48.703
When the ego is pampered we feel happy,

01:05:48.903 --> 01:05:51.783
when it is disturbed we feel unhappy.

01:05:52.183 --> 01:05:55.263
Joy is beyond happiness and unhappiness.

01:05:55.623 --> 01:05:57.103
It has no duality.

01:05:57.303 --> 01:06:01.143
It's a state where you are in a joyous state.

01:06:01.343 --> 01:06:04.823
You watch everything in a joyous state.

01:06:04.982 --> 01:06:06.943
Like I went to France and they said,

01:06:07.103 --> 01:06:09.063
“Mother, you look so joyous and happy

01:06:09.263 --> 01:06:13.983
and the French are not going to be happy about it”. I said “Why?”

01:06:14.703 --> 01:06:18.663
"Because they think you are ignorant, you don’t understand.

01:06:18.863 --> 01:06:21.343
It’s a shocking state we are in and how can you be joyous?”

01:06:21.663 --> 01:06:24.343
They are "the very miserable people",

01:06:24.623 --> 01:06:26.343
so I called them “Les Misérables”,

01:06:26.583 --> 01:06:28.783
as Victor Hugo has described them.

01:06:28.982 --> 01:06:30.823
But look at these miserable people,

01:06:30.982 --> 01:06:33.743
they have got every fourth house is a brothel,

01:06:33.943 --> 01:06:35.982
every tenth house is a pub

01:06:36.143 --> 01:06:39.303
and every twelfth house there’s a divorce case.

01:06:39.703 --> 01:06:43.663
How can you be happy? You have made all arrangements to be unhappy.

01:06:43.982 --> 01:06:48.103
And then you want to take pride in that unhappiness?

01:06:48.703 --> 01:06:51.543
You have arranged everything to destroy yourself

01:06:51.743 --> 01:06:55.903
and now you are identified with your destruction and happy with it.

01:06:56.143 --> 01:06:58.823
But now France is changing, I must tell you.

01:06:58.982 --> 01:07:01.303
We have had very good response in France also.

01:07:01.463 --> 01:07:05.383
Surprisingly the people in France who were just waiting

01:07:05.623 --> 01:07:07.463
for some catastrophe to fall on them,

01:07:07.703 --> 01:07:09.623
so that they are all perished now once for all -

01:07:09.823 --> 01:07:11.823
that’s the last of it they have been asking for -

01:07:11.982 --> 01:07:13.343
are so much changed.

01:07:13.623 --> 01:07:17.783
Even the people in Switzerland, Sweden and Norway

01:07:17.982 --> 01:07:21.463
where they are so affluent and planning to commit suicides,

01:07:21.703 --> 01:07:23.983
morning till evening, they have changed.

01:07:24.183 --> 01:07:26.463
Everywhere there’s a big change I find.

01:07:26.743 --> 01:07:29.583
But the best country that I find in the Western world,

01:07:29.783 --> 01:07:33.583
or the westernized world, is your country, Australia.

01:07:33.783 --> 01:07:38.743
Australia is the great country where the Ayers Rock is there

01:07:38.943 --> 01:07:42.343
which represents this center.

01:07:42.623 --> 01:07:45.463
Now when I say that, you are not to believe Me also.

01:07:45.703 --> 01:07:48.383
When you get your Realization, you can ask the question:

01:07:48.623 --> 01:07:50.423
“Is Australia the Mooladhara?

01:07:50.663 --> 01:07:55.543
Is this the support of the roots? Is it the one?”

01:07:55.743 --> 01:07:58.183
And you’ll be amazed that you’ll get tremendous vibrations,

01:07:58.383 --> 01:07:59.263
that’s a fact.

01:07:59.463 --> 01:08:02.703
Whatever you may try, whatever you may do, you are that

01:08:02.903 --> 01:08:05.183
and that’s why I bow to you all.

01:08:05.383 --> 01:08:09.463
Today is the last day I’m here. It’s a short time I’ve been here.

01:08:09.703 --> 01:08:11.823
But hope to see you again on Wednesday.

01:08:11.982 --> 01:08:14.743
They want to have some sort of a workshop for you.

01:08:14.943 --> 01:08:16.983
I`ve made it a point, to stay back on Wednesday,

01:08:17.183 --> 01:08:18.823
to see you all there.

01:08:18.982 --> 01:08:21.623
Whatever problems you have, I will deal with it.

01:08:21.823 --> 01:08:23.623
Now somebody has asked a question,

01:08:23.823 --> 01:08:28.983
“Are we primitive still as when the floods were there?”

01:08:29.183 --> 01:08:33.982
So we are not. We are very conscious,

01:08:34.143 --> 01:08:37.383
we are conscious of our society, conscious of our world,

01:08:37.623 --> 01:08:40.983
and once you become the light, you change the whole world

01:08:41.183 --> 01:08:43.943
because Sahaja Yoga is not an individual thing.

01:08:44.103 --> 01:08:47.183
It is a collective happening, it’s a collective happening.

01:08:47.383 --> 01:08:50.823
and it is facing towards the society,

01:08:50.982 --> 01:08:54.743
facing towards the world, the universe, at large.

01:08:54.943 --> 01:08:59.303
So to say that we are at the same state is not true,

01:08:59.623 --> 01:09:02.143
because whatever we have achieved through science,

01:09:02.343 --> 01:09:04.063
is also of great use.

01:09:04.263 --> 01:09:06.823
For example, now if this was not available

01:09:06.982 --> 01:09:09.982
I could not have talked to you all, in such a big way.

01:09:10.143 --> 01:09:11.543
If there was no television

01:09:11.743 --> 01:09:13.623
- on the television I can give Realization to people

01:09:13.823 --> 01:09:15.303
if they give me a chance.

01:09:15.463 --> 01:09:17.703
I can give to thousands of them Realization,

01:09:17.903 --> 01:09:20.663
if they give me a chance. But it`s rather difficult to get there.

01:09:20.863 --> 01:09:25.063
Now these photographs also have got vibrations, most surprising.

01:09:25.263 --> 01:09:29.663
I’ve seen that there are some photographs where people have taken,

01:09:29.863 --> 01:09:32.823
photographs, which they could not see the light coming on My head,

01:09:32.982 --> 01:09:36.103
the light coming through My hands, light coming through My feet,

01:09:36.303 --> 01:09:38.223
all those things they have taken photographs.

01:09:38.423 --> 01:09:40.463
So your camera is also showing it.

01:09:40.703 --> 01:09:43.463
Television is the best way we can spread Sahaja Yoga,

01:09:43.703 --> 01:09:47.143
if they help out us a little bit, have some faith in Sahaja Yoga.

01:09:47.343 --> 01:09:48.823
I’m sure it will grow one day

01:09:48.983 --> 01:09:51.063
and we’ll be able to work out through television.

01:09:51.263 --> 01:09:55.303
So nothing is going to be wasted,

01:09:55.463 --> 01:09:57.663
least of all the human beings.

01:09:57.863 --> 01:09:59.583
But we must know their purpose.

01:09:59.783 --> 01:10:03.223
The life has no purpose without Self Realization.

01:10:03.743 --> 01:10:06.383
After Self Realization it is so purposeful,

01:10:06.623 --> 01:10:08.143
full of love enjoyment,

01:10:08.343 --> 01:10:12.903
full of love giving and you know your worth and value after that.

01:10:13.623 --> 01:10:18.063
The question was, second one was rather patterning to Yogananda.

01:10:18.343 --> 01:10:20.383
I’d better not say much about this gentleman

01:10:20.623 --> 01:10:22.583
because I’m really angry with him.

01:10:22.783 --> 01:10:24.943
He cut the tongues of people

01:10:25.103 --> 01:10:28.743
nd there are many people you find in Los Angeles who cannot talk.

01:10:28.943 --> 01:10:31.663
They have bagging tongues, like dogs they are moving.

01:10:31.863 --> 01:10:34.623
This horrible fellow Yogananda, I don’t know what is he up to.

01:10:34.823 --> 01:10:36.783
And he said that you have to do the kechari,

01:10:36.982 --> 01:10:39.663
is a kind of a thing where you pull your tongue back here

01:10:39.863 --> 01:10:43.103
and that’s how he said the Kundalini will rise. It's absurd!

01:10:43.663 --> 01:10:46.543
Because when the Kundalini rises by itself,

01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:49.143
as a result of that some things happen within you.

01:10:49.343 --> 01:10:51.703
After all rising of the Kundalini takes place,

01:10:51.903 --> 01:10:55.303
something living thing has to happen like a digestive juices

01:10:55.623 --> 01:10:58.982
are poured when you take something to be digestive.

01:10:59.143 --> 01:11:02.023
In the same way, when the Kundalini rises, there are bandhans, means

01:11:02.223 --> 01:11:04.663
the things to hold the Kundalini, to push it forward

01:11:04.863 --> 01:11:07.383
and then also this is a little bit sucked in, no doubt,

01:11:07.623 --> 01:11:09.463
but you don’t feel anything.

01:11:09.863 --> 01:11:11.383
Is an automatic happening.

01:11:11.623 --> 01:11:14.863
Like a car starts, starts moving, the wheels also move,

01:11:15.023 --> 01:11:16.903
but if you take out the wheel and start moving it,

01:11:17.063 --> 01:11:18.823
will the car move?

01:11:18.982 --> 01:11:22.303
And this absolutely an absurd thing called Kriya Yoga.

01:11:22.663 --> 01:11:26.143
Sahaja Yoga is a-kriya. There’s nothing to be done, effortless.

01:11:26.343 --> 01:11:28.783
Automatically the living process takes place.

01:11:28.982 --> 01:11:30.943
Supposing you have to sprout a seed

01:11:31.103 --> 01:11:34.383
and you take out the primule and pull it out, will it sprout?

01:11:34.623 --> 01:11:39.863
It’s a living process, let it happen spontaneously, Sahaja.

01:11:40.023 --> 01:11:43.982
So this kind of a thing that is preached, is absolutely nonsensical.

01:11:44.263 --> 01:11:46.303
This horrible thing he has done

01:11:46.463 --> 01:11:48.463
is to take out the tongues of people.

01:11:48.703 --> 01:11:49.903
They still exist.

01:11:50.063 --> 01:11:52.703
They still exist these people, they cannot talk,

01:11:52.903 --> 01:11:54.103
their tongues are bagging.

01:11:54.303 --> 01:11:57.103
He’s made a big money, that another lady of his has made big money.

01:11:57.303 --> 01:11:58.943
She has made big money.

01:11:59.103 --> 01:12:02.943
So it has nothing to do with God. It's horrible.

01:12:03.103 --> 01:12:04.743
It's something, [sadist thing].

01:12:04.943 --> 01:12:06.823
Some people make you suffer so much,

01:12:06.982 --> 01:12:09.863
they make you give a food like somebody told Me,

01:12:10.023 --> 01:12:13.663
they paid six thousand pounds to go to Switzerland,

01:12:13.863 --> 01:12:16.463
to fly in the air, six thousands pounds!

01:12:16.703 --> 01:12:18.903
And they were given for 6 days the water

01:12:19.063 --> 01:12:21.863
in which they had boiled potatoes, six days!

01:12:22.023 --> 01:12:23.983
And the seventh day the rind of the potatoes

01:12:24.183 --> 01:12:25.583
for six thousand pounds.

01:12:25.783 --> 01:12:28.903
And the last day they gave them the potatoes.

01:12:29.063 --> 01:12:31.663
The people became so week, so possessed.

01:12:31.863 --> 01:12:33.023
I’ve seen some of them,

01:12:33.223 --> 01:12:37.023
they are even afraid of looking at a garlic, can you believe it?

01:12:37.223 --> 01:12:40.463
They are afraid of garlics, they are afraid of lemons.

01:12:40.703 --> 01:12:43.383
Such people, such recluses have been created!

01:12:43.783 --> 01:12:46.103
How can that be anything to do with God?

01:12:46.343 --> 01:12:49.863
For a while, of course, you get possessed so you get more excited,

01:12:50.023 --> 01:12:51.783
little bit happens to you.

01:12:51.982 --> 01:12:53.583
But that’s not a permanent affair.

01:12:53.783 --> 01:12:57.983
If you go and see, those disciples after 5-6 years will be lost.

01:12:58.183 --> 01:12:59.303
You cannot find them.

01:12:59.463 --> 01:13:02.063
Where are they, these doctors and these great people?

01:13:02.263 --> 01:13:04.143
They are mostly in the lunatic asylum,

01:13:04.343 --> 01:13:06.143
or they are suffering from epilepsy.

01:13:06.343 --> 01:13:08.143
I’ve seen people of that kind.

01:13:08.343 --> 01:13:14.063
In Scotland there was a Flying Academy, where the people were sent.

01:13:14.263 --> 01:13:17.303
The owner of that academy, his wife and his child

01:13:17.623 --> 01:13:19.583
the wife was the granddaughter of a duke,

01:13:19.783 --> 01:13:21.903
the gentleman was a diamond merchant

01:13:22.063 --> 01:13:23.583
all of them became bankrupt,

01:13:23.783 --> 01:13:27.143
they came to Me with epilepsy of a very serious type.

01:13:27.343 --> 01:13:30.383
very serious type. They got cured, but the fellow became bankrupt,

01:13:30.623 --> 01:13:33.263
so he had to go back to South Africa,

01:13:33.463 --> 01:13:37.303
The wife is there, she is now in India and the child is all right.

01:13:37.463 --> 01:13:40.223
This is the situation. How can you become epileptic,

01:13:40.423 --> 01:13:42.623
how can you have problems, going to God?

01:13:42.823 --> 01:13:45.623
You have to improve, your condition must improve.

01:13:45.823 --> 01:13:47.383
But still people stick on,

01:13:47.703 --> 01:13:50.823
because there's a kind of mesmerism I think,

01:13:50.982 --> 01:13:53.423
or a kind of a conditioning on their heads

01:13:53.663 --> 01:13:56.982
or they think, “We have paid the money so let us go through it!”

01:13:57.343 --> 01:14:01.063
Better not, better be considerate, kind to yourself.

01:14:01.263 --> 01:14:04.583
This body, this mind, this human frame,

01:14:04.783 --> 01:14:06.823
all this is made with great difficulty.

01:14:06.982 --> 01:14:09.343
Please do not waste it, please respect it,

01:14:09.583 --> 01:14:13.983
understand that no use identifying yourself

01:14:14.183 --> 01:14:18.423
with something which is false, fake, injurious and troublesome.

01:14:18.823 --> 01:14:22.743
Better get to something that is your own! I would say, be selfish.

01:14:22.943 --> 01:14:25.743
In Sanskrit it is called the word swarth,

01:14:25.982 --> 01:14:28.663
You see the Sanskrit’s callers were very clever.

01:14:28.863 --> 01:14:31.663
So selfishness is called as swarth meaning the,

01:14:31.863 --> 01:14:34.343
swarth means the meaning of the swa.

01:14:34.623 --> 01:14:35.543
Swa means the Self.

01:14:35.743 --> 01:14:39.063
You find out the meaning of the Self is the selfishness.

01:14:39.383 --> 01:14:43.343
That’s the best, is to find out the meaning of the Self.

01:14:43.623 --> 01:14:46.303
So if you become selfish, you better become the Self.

01:14:46.703 --> 01:14:48.543
That’s the best way to look at it.

01:14:48.743 --> 01:14:51.223
I’m sorry, so many of these Indian horrible people,

01:14:51.423 --> 01:14:53.663
came here and have exploited you.

01:14:53.863 --> 01:14:55.903
I really am sorry but you are so naive.

01:14:56.063 --> 01:14:57.982
They could not do anything in India,

01:14:58.143 --> 01:14:59.823
because people traditionally know.

01:14:59.982 --> 01:15:03.783
That’s why they are here, they could not befool us, they could not.

01:15:03.982 --> 01:15:06.823
We know them very well, we know all this kind very well.

01:15:06.982 --> 01:15:10.303
So they had to come down here to exploit you and trouble you.

01:15:10.463 --> 01:15:13.143
So I’m sorry for that, I’m very sorry,

01:15:13.343 --> 01:15:16.943
but now at least you take to right thinking and understanding,

01:15:17.103 --> 01:15:20.023
that you cannot pay for it, you cannot putting any effort,

01:15:20.223 --> 01:15:22.743
it’s a living process of your evolution.

01:15:22.943 --> 01:15:25.463
Just understand that and it will work out.

01:15:25.703 --> 01:15:27.063
I am sure it will work out.

01:15:27.263 --> 01:15:28.982
I hope you’ll make it convenient

01:15:29.143 --> 01:15:32.023
to come to the workshop they are going to have,

01:15:32.223 --> 01:15:34.743
where I’ll deal with you personally.

01:15:34.943 --> 01:15:37.183
The other question was about Yoga.

01:15:37.383 --> 01:15:40.823
What about Yoga? The Yoga you know is a wee bit of exercises,

01:15:40.982 --> 01:15:43.543
is not Yoga. Yoga means union with the Divine.

01:15:43.743 --> 01:15:45.943
And they use to do this thousands of years back,

01:15:46.103 --> 01:15:47.663
in a very different system.

01:15:47.863 --> 01:15:50.703
But now we too do certain exercises

01:15:50.903 --> 01:15:52.823
but according to the Kundalini rising.

01:15:52.983 --> 01:15:55.383
Even in Patanjali Yoga if you read the whole book

01:15:55.623 --> 01:15:56.583
which people do not read.

01:15:56.783 --> 01:15:59.063
They get it from some third, forth hand knowledge.

01:15:59.263 --> 01:16:02.903
If you read it, it is, yoga means not the exercises,

01:16:03.063 --> 01:16:04.703
but when the Kundalini is rising

01:16:04.903 --> 01:16:08.063
and whatever is the chakra catching, if there’s a physical problem,

01:16:08.263 --> 01:16:10.463
then you have to do a particular asanas

01:16:10.703 --> 01:16:12.943
or a particular type of an exercise

01:16:13.103 --> 01:16:16.423
which is related, which is absolutely particular

01:16:16.663 --> 01:16:18.343
to that particular chakras.

01:16:18.583 --> 01:16:21.103
So just to do indiscriminate asanas

01:16:21.303 --> 01:16:23.543
is very dangerous especially for heart,

01:16:23.743 --> 01:16:27.063
is a very dangerous thing to do indiscriminate asanas,

01:16:27.263 --> 01:16:30.023
because one can get troubles of the heart.

01:16:30.223 --> 01:16:33.063
So it is better to understand the whole science behind it

01:16:33.263 --> 01:16:38.343
There’s a big science of mantras also, science of these asanas.

01:16:38.663 --> 01:16:42.303
Without doing it you are taking the medicine indiscriminately,

01:16:42.463 --> 01:16:44.663
of the whole of the medicine box.

01:16:44.863 --> 01:16:46.543
It’s like that without understanding.

01:16:46.743 --> 01:16:49.023
So be careful, respect your body,

01:16:49.223 --> 01:16:51.982
respect your being! That’s what I have to say as a Mother.

01:16:52.143 --> 01:16:54.743
May God bless you all!

01:17:08.143 --> 01:17:10.183
So now if there are any more questions,

01:17:10.383 --> 01:17:12.983
you can write them down and give it to them.

01:17:13.183 --> 01:17:17.343
Next time when I have the,

01:17:17.583 --> 01:17:19.423
S.M.: Wednesday we are having.
SY: I`ve told them.

01:17:19.703 --> 01:17:23.823
S.M.: Yes, then I will answer these questions in person.

01:17:32.023 --> 01:17:36.223
But as I told you it’s not a mental projection, it’s a happening.

01:17:36.463 --> 01:17:38.903
It’s a happening, it should happen to all of you

01:17:39.063 --> 01:17:40.743
but there’s no guarantee.

01:17:40.943 --> 01:17:44.103
Most of you get it, some of you may not, doesn’t matter.

01:17:44.303 --> 01:17:48.343
If not today, tomorrow everyone gets it, that’s the point.

01:17:48.823 --> 01:17:52.063
Some people have some problems, some barriers,

01:17:52.703 --> 01:17:57.263
something wrong, but very few of them. Most of them get Realization.

01:17:57.623 --> 01:17:59.943
So you should not get disappointed.

01:18:03.263 --> 01:18:05.583
To start with, we have to understand

01:18:05.783 --> 01:18:09.863
that these centers are made of different elements,

01:18:10.103 --> 01:18:14.663
the essences of the elements, as we call them, the causal,

01:18:14.863 --> 01:18:16.183
the causal of the elements.

01:18:16.383 --> 01:18:21.143
And now as I told you that the triangular bone

01:18:21.343 --> 01:18:24.703
is made out of the earth element.

01:18:24.903 --> 01:18:27.343
we have to take the advantage of the earth element,

01:18:27.663 --> 01:18:31.463
we have to take the advantage of all the elements.

01:18:31.743 --> 01:18:35.303
And that you will learn gradually how you take advantage of that.

01:18:35.623 --> 01:18:37.863
When these elements are in proper proportions

01:18:38.023 --> 01:18:41.183
and in proper balance you never have any problem.

01:18:41.383 --> 01:18:43.383
But when they get disturbed and upset,

01:18:43.623 --> 01:18:46.423
then only you start getting the problem.

01:18:46.703 --> 01:18:49.863
He has already told you how things are caused in trouble.

01:18:50.023 --> 01:18:51.303
I will only explain to you

01:18:51.463 --> 01:18:54.343
how cancer is caused because that’s very important.

01:18:54.663 --> 01:18:58.183
Also AIDS, AIDS and things which are very incurable

01:18:58.383 --> 01:19:01.063
and people are frightened of them.

01:19:01.863 --> 01:19:05.463
It's very simple to understand that supposing this is a center

01:19:05.743 --> 01:19:07.863
and this is the left side and this is the right side,

01:19:08.023 --> 01:19:10.623
I hope all of you can see this very clearly.

01:19:10.823 --> 01:19:13.982
Now what happens that when there is

01:19:14.143 --> 01:19:16.943
too much activity on the left side or the right side.

01:19:17.103 --> 01:19:20.983
even right side when a person is very futuristic and all that.

01:19:21.183 --> 01:19:23.903
Then what happens that you become vulnerable

01:19:24.063 --> 01:19:25.863
to cancer, you become vulnerable.

01:19:26.023 --> 01:19:29.063
But the triggering as the doctor say, takes place

01:19:29.263 --> 01:19:33.863
by some proteins they call as protein 58, protein 52.

01:19:34.063 --> 01:19:36.023
That’s just like doctors, when they don’t know the names

01:19:36.223 --> 01:19:40.463
they just give them numbers like criminals, number 52, 58.

01:19:40.982 --> 01:19:46.303
But these they say so, clearly, that come from the areas,

01:19:46.463 --> 01:19:49.463
built within us since our creation.

01:19:49.703 --> 01:19:51.663
So it is the collective subconscious

01:19:51.863 --> 01:19:56.063
which exists on the left hand side, beyond the subconscious mind,

01:19:56.863 --> 01:19:58.743
beyond the subconscious mind.

01:19:58.943 --> 01:20:02.063
Now from this you will realize that this subconscious mind

01:20:02.263 --> 01:20:04.982
is placed next to this blue line

01:20:05.143 --> 01:20:07.903
and then the collective subconscious.

01:20:08.063 --> 01:20:10.343
On the right hand side, the supraconscious mind

01:20:10.663 --> 01:20:13.343
and then the collective supraconscious mind.

01:20:13.623 --> 01:20:17.623
So the people who die, with conditioning and all that,

01:20:17.823 --> 01:20:23.743
and still wanting to exist as spirits, can exist in that area.

01:20:23.943 --> 01:20:30.383
Whatever has gone out of the circulation of our evolution,

01:20:30.783 --> 01:20:35.703
rests in that area which is built within us since our creation.

01:20:35.943 --> 01:20:39.903
So viruses are caused by the plants

01:20:40.063 --> 01:20:42.863
or we can say microscopic animals

01:20:43.023 --> 01:20:45.223
which are thrown out

01:20:45.423 --> 01:20:51.343
of the circulation of our evolution.

01:20:51.743 --> 01:20:54.982
In the same way there are spirits - as Christians we know

01:20:55.143 --> 01:20:57.303
Christ took out the spirits and put them in the pigs -

01:20:57.623 --> 01:21:03.983
so the spirits that are the dead spirits of people,

01:21:04.183 --> 01:21:10.703
who have not yet accepted that they are to leave this world,

01:21:10.903 --> 01:21:14.743
and are still busy hanging around, such people are there.

01:21:14.943 --> 01:21:17.982
And these are the people used by most of these gurus

01:21:18.143 --> 01:21:19.863
when they mesmerize you.

01:21:20.023 --> 01:21:24.903
Once they mesmerize you, you are drawn more towards the left side,

01:21:25.103 --> 01:21:29.343
towards the left collective subconscious.

01:21:29.623 --> 01:21:33.583
And when you go to the collective subconscious, that’s the area

01:21:33.783 --> 01:21:35.783
from where this triggering takes place.

01:21:35.982 --> 01:21:40.143
So too much of activity already it is sort of getting dislocated.

01:21:40.343 --> 01:21:43.343
So the relationship with the whole is not there.

01:21:43.703 --> 01:21:47.103
When the relationship of the whole is just precariously placed,

01:21:47.303 --> 01:21:49.983
this trigger out and you just move out.

01:21:50.183 --> 01:21:53.943
Then in this area all the cells, on this area maybe,

01:21:54.103 --> 01:21:57.143
all the cells that are there become on their own,

01:21:57.343 --> 01:22:01.583
means that they become arbitrary, they start attacking each other,

01:22:01.783 --> 01:22:03.743
we call it they become malignant.

01:22:03.943 --> 01:22:05.623
This is how cancer is settling.

01:22:05.823 --> 01:22:07.343
Now what happens to the Kundalini?

01:22:07.623 --> 01:22:11.943
When Kundalini rises, she tries to bring them together.

01:22:12.103 --> 01:22:15.423
Now here she awakens the deity there,

01:22:15.663 --> 01:22:19.143
by which the flow starts and it is kept intact.

01:22:19.343 --> 01:22:23.023
Apart from that she gets you connected with the source,

01:22:23.223 --> 01:22:26.543
so all the time that energy is flowing within you,

01:22:26.743 --> 01:22:29.463
so you do not get any diseases of that kind.

01:22:29.743 --> 01:22:33.303
Same thing with AIDS. At the lower, lowest one.

01:22:33.982 --> 01:22:37.463
This one, with the, it is combined with some other chakra,

01:22:37.703 --> 01:22:38.903
this thing takes place.

01:22:39.063 --> 01:22:42.543
I've seen as commonly done by this chakra, on the left hand side.

01:22:42.743 --> 01:22:46.103
When by some means, you do something very perverted,

01:22:46.303 --> 01:22:48.143
and go to the left side,

01:22:48.343 --> 01:22:50.583
go to the left side too much,

01:22:50.783 --> 01:22:52.863
then you get attacked by these things.

01:22:53.023 --> 01:22:56.663
So AIDS can be cured very easily through Sahaja Yoga.

01:22:56.863 --> 01:22:59.343
But after curing you,

01:22:59.663 --> 01:23:02.103
if you go to the same thing and do it again and again,

01:23:02.303 --> 01:23:04.463
then again you get back to the same state.

01:23:04.783 --> 01:23:06.983
By bringing you in the center, you get cured.

01:23:07.183 --> 01:23:08.943
But if you try to go back again,

01:23:09.103 --> 01:23:11.543
to the same side, on the left hand side, you get it.

01:23:11.743 --> 01:23:14.303
The right side diseases, as he has described to you,

01:23:14.463 --> 01:23:16.743
are like the liver trouble,

01:23:16.943 --> 01:23:20.703
which is active liver, you can get cirrhoses of liver, jaundice,

01:23:20.903 --> 01:23:24.223
you can get with
that right sidedness

01:23:24.423 --> 01:23:26.623
what you call, the diabetes,

01:23:26.823 --> 01:23:31.343
also the hectic life gives you what we call the blood cancer.

01:23:31.623 --> 01:23:33.623
If the mother is hectic, father is hectic,

01:23:33.823 --> 01:23:35.703
if the family is hectic by temperament,

01:23:35.903 --> 01:23:37.982
the child can get blood cancer.

01:23:38.143 --> 01:23:41.943
These all can be cured through Sahaja Yoga, in a proper state.

01:23:42.103 --> 01:23:43.983
But if it is absolutely a gone case,

01:23:44.183 --> 01:23:45.663
we do not bother about it,

01:23:45.863 --> 01:23:48.303
but we think let the person be born again

01:23:48.463 --> 01:23:51.103
so that we can give him Realization properly.

01:23:51.303 --> 01:23:53.343
So the object of Sahaja Yoga

01:23:53.583 --> 01:23:56.663
is not to fight the diseases, but to create doctors

01:23:56.863 --> 01:23:59.903
to create people who are healthy, who can give light to others.

01:24:00.063 --> 01:24:01.663
It’s common sense.

01:24:01.982 --> 01:24:07.183
The lamp which is going to give no light, we do not repair it.

01:24:07.383 --> 01:24:09.343
In the same way the personality

01:24:09.583 --> 01:24:13.143
that is not going to give any more light is not repaired.

01:24:13.343 --> 01:24:15.143
And that’s why you have to learn

01:24:15.343 --> 01:24:17.982
that you get cured because you have to give the light.

01:24:18.143 --> 01:24:21.183
This is very important and I have seen wherever it has failed,

01:24:21.383 --> 01:24:24.183
people have again gone back to their own same diseases.

01:24:24.623 --> 01:24:29.783
This is what is Sahaja Yoga. It's so simple and so benevolent.

01:24:30.423 --> 01:24:33.983
So now, to have the experience of the Spirit,

01:24:34.183 --> 01:24:36.063
I will request you to take out your shoes,

01:24:36.263 --> 01:24:39.583
to touch the Mother Earth, first of all.

01:24:47.583 --> 01:24:49.263
It will take about 10 minutes

01:24:49.463 --> 01:24:52.943
for you to get your Realization, not more than that.

01:24:53.823 --> 01:24:57.423
What’s the matter with this gentleman?

01:24:57.663 --> 01:24:58.823
What is he talking?

01:24:58.982 --> 01:25:01.463
P: I said, why You divert God's word?

01:25:01.743 --> 01:25:05.263
What is he saying?
SY: We don’t need this.

01:25:08.943 --> 01:25:11.982
SY: Just don’t, don’t respond him.

01:25:12.143 --> 01:25:14.903
SM: Better take him out.

01:25:19.063 --> 01:25:20.223
Look at that now!

01:25:20.423 --> 01:25:24.263
He must be belonging to some church or something else.

01:25:25.982 --> 01:25:27.943
SY: Please ask him to go!

01:25:28.103 --> 01:25:32.903
SM: He must be drunk, must be drunk. Don’t be harsh, don’t be harsh!

01:25:39.223 --> 01:25:41.903
He must be drunk, just forget it!

01:25:43.703 --> 01:25:46.903
Perhaps you see so many of them on the street also,

01:25:47.063 --> 01:25:48.223
like that talking.

01:25:48.423 --> 01:25:50.982
But they disturb, they disturb, that’s the main point is.

01:25:51.143 --> 01:25:52.823
Don’t get disturb with it!

01:25:52.983 --> 01:25:54.903
I don’t know what he was talking about,

01:25:55.063 --> 01:25:57.623
but there’s no need to be aggressive, I mean I don’t know.

01:25:57.823 --> 01:26:00.183
I didn’t say anything.

01:26:02.663 --> 01:26:04.943
Let us settle down with our peace.

01:26:05.143 --> 01:26:09.063
We have to all get our Realization. We are sensible, wise people.

01:26:09.383 --> 01:26:12.982
Put your feet please on the Mother Earth.

01:26:13.943 --> 01:26:18.703
There is very least to be done, very least.

01:26:18.903 --> 01:26:23.343
We don’t want you to give up anything before Sahaja Yoga,

01:26:23.703 --> 01:26:27.623
because you just - we are not told, "Don’t do this, don’t do that".

01:26:27.863 --> 01:26:30.583
It just works out within you, you become that,

01:26:30.783 --> 01:26:34.023
you become a personality of virtues, of righteousness.

01:26:34.223 --> 01:26:36.143
I don’t have to tell you.

01:26:36.343 --> 01:26:39.663
We didn’t have to tell Christ not to do bad things, isn’t it?

01:26:39.863 --> 01:26:42.143
Because He was a realized soul, He was a great soul.

01:26:42.343 --> 01:26:44.023
In the same way when you become that

01:26:44.223 --> 01:26:46.703
you are not to be told "Don’t do this, don’t do that".

01:26:46.903 --> 01:26:49.943
But you have to be a Realized Soul, that’s important.

01:26:50.463 --> 01:26:52.982
So it’s very little to be done,

01:26:53.143 --> 01:26:57.623
not much is to be done about it, it's very simple.

01:26:58.023 --> 01:27:00.623
Only thing I would request you, to take out your spectacles

01:27:00.823 --> 01:27:03.703
because it improves your eyesight also.

01:27:04.023 --> 01:27:06.783
Just it’s a very little thing to do.

01:27:06.982 --> 01:27:09.982
Now put your both hands

01:27:10.143 --> 01:27:13.143
in this way, on your lap, in a very simple way.

01:27:13.343 --> 01:27:15.023
Both the hands like this on your lap.

01:27:15.223 --> 01:27:17.783
Just like this, on your lap, comfortable.

01:27:18.183 --> 01:27:20.943
There’s one more thing, if there’s anything uncomfortable,

01:27:21.103 --> 01:27:23.823
you feel uncomfortable with, you better remove it.

01:27:23.982 --> 01:27:26.183
Some people might be wearing coats or something,

01:27:26.383 --> 01:27:28.583
feeling uncomfortable, please remove it.

01:27:28.783 --> 01:27:32.023
Now please put both hands like this, just like this.

01:27:32.623 --> 01:27:34.863
SY: On your lap, on the lap.

01:27:35.623 --> 01:27:38.863
And there’s nothing to be serious, of course nothing frivolous also.

01:27:39.023 --> 01:27:42.303
But it is something you must know of serenity,

01:27:42.463 --> 01:27:44.943
of joy and of pleasant temperament.

01:27:45.183 --> 01:27:47.623
You have to be pleasantly posted towards it.

01:27:47.823 --> 01:27:50.982
Because you are going to enter into the Kingdom of God.

01:27:51.623 --> 01:27:52.943
You are going to enter there.

01:27:53.103 --> 01:27:55.983
So it’s a very pleasant thing which you have being seeking for ages,

01:27:56.183 --> 01:27:57.703
which is going to happen to you,

01:27:57.903 --> 01:28:00.863
so you must have that expectation and that joy

01:28:01.023 --> 01:28:05.703
or that kind of a temperament, very pleasant,

01:28:05.903 --> 01:28:11.343
as if you are now on your way to your salvation.

01:28:11.943 --> 01:28:15.823
So put your left hand towards Me

01:28:15.982 --> 01:28:17.983
that means this is the desire

01:28:18.183 --> 01:28:20.982
that you have, that you want to get your Realization.

01:28:21.143 --> 01:28:23.463
And the right hand on your heart.

01:28:23.743 --> 01:28:27.743
Because in the heart as I told you resides the Spirit.

01:28:27.982 --> 01:28:31.183
Now only I’ll show you beforehand, before you close your eyes

01:28:31.423 --> 01:28:33.423
what are the chakras we are going to tackle

01:28:33.663 --> 01:28:36.183
and how you are going to raise your Kundalini,

01:28:36.383 --> 01:28:38.463
awaken your Kundalini, not Me.

01:28:39.023 --> 01:28:40.903
So I’m going to tell you what is to be done

01:28:41.063 --> 01:28:42.383
and later on we’ll do it.

01:28:42.623 --> 01:28:45.583
But just now I’ll just show you, that first on the heart,

01:28:45.783 --> 01:28:48.023
then in the upper part of the abdomen,

01:28:48.223 --> 01:28:51.343
on the left hand side, everything on the left hand side.

01:28:51.663 --> 01:28:53.783
Then in the lower part of the abdomen,

01:28:53.982 --> 01:28:56.583
then you go back to the upper part of the abdomen,

01:28:56.783 --> 01:28:58.383
then you go to the heart again,

01:28:58.623 --> 01:29:03.463
then you go here on the corner

01:29:03.743 --> 01:29:06.623
of the neck and the shoulder,

01:29:06.823 --> 01:29:09.023
then you go on top of your head here

01:29:09.223 --> 01:29:12.663
across like this or say, on your forehead.

01:29:12.863 --> 01:29:15.663
And then you go at the back, here,

01:29:15.863 --> 01:29:18.063
on the optic lobe, holding the optic lobe,

01:29:18.263 --> 01:29:22.943
then here your palm going on top of your fontanelle bone area,

01:29:23.103 --> 01:29:26.063
which was a soft bone on top of your head

01:29:26.263 --> 01:29:27.983
and you have to move it seven times

01:29:28.183 --> 01:29:30.943
which I’ll tell you clearly later on.

01:29:31.103 --> 01:29:33.823
Now, please close your eyes.

01:29:34.383 --> 01:29:35.903
At the very outset,

01:29:36.063 --> 01:29:39.463
I have to make a very, very humble request to you,

01:29:39.703 --> 01:29:41.703
"Do not feel guilty!"

01:29:41.982 --> 01:29:46.823
Please do not feel guilty! If you feel guilty

01:29:46.982 --> 01:29:52.343
then it is difficult to achieve Realization.

01:29:53.943 --> 01:29:57.863
After all, as I told you, you are a special category.

01:29:58.223 --> 01:30:01.343
Forgive yourself, you have done nothing wrong

01:30:01.583 --> 01:30:05.343
and God is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:30:05.823 --> 01:30:07.943
He is the one who can forgive everything.

01:30:08.183 --> 01:30:10.383
So please, first of all forgive yourself

01:30:10.623 --> 01:30:13.023
and say in your heart that you are not at all guilty.

01:30:13.223 --> 01:30:16.063
Because that is the biggest hurdle, in the West countries I've seen.

01:30:16.263 --> 01:30:19.103
Westernized people, they have a fashion to feel guilty

01:30:19.303 --> 01:30:23.383
for every small, every big, every sort of a nonsense thing.

01:30:23.623 --> 01:30:25.143
So not to feel guilty at all.

01:30:25.343 --> 01:30:26.983
So in a pleasant mood we sit down,

01:30:27.183 --> 01:30:30.143
forgiving ourselves, not thinking bad about ourselves.

01:30:30.343 --> 01:30:33.623
Becoming miserable, “Les Misérables” we need, need not be.

01:30:33.943 --> 01:30:38.943
So now with the left hand towards Me what we do,

01:30:39.103 --> 01:30:41.583
that we put our right hand on the heart.

01:30:42.103 --> 01:30:43.743
Now keep your eyes shut.

01:30:43.943 --> 01:30:46.183
You are not to open your eyes till I tell you,

01:30:46.383 --> 01:30:48.743
because whatever happens is inside.

01:30:48.943 --> 01:30:51.463
The attention has to be inside and if your eyes are open,

01:30:51.703 --> 01:30:53.103
the attention goes outside.

01:30:53.303 --> 01:30:55.543
So please don’t open your eyes.

01:30:55.743 --> 01:30:59.623
Put your right hand on your heart.

01:31:00.103 --> 01:31:05.703
Now, in the heart resides your Spirit.

01:31:07.063 --> 01:31:10.943
Please put. Close your eyes, please close your eyes!

01:31:13.343 --> 01:31:17.982
Here you have to ask Me a question, from your heart.

01:31:18.623 --> 01:31:20.223
You can call Me, Shri Mataji,

01:31:20.423 --> 01:31:22.863
or you can call Me, Mother, whatever you like.

01:31:23.023 --> 01:31:27.903
“Mother, am I the Spirit?” Ask the question three times.

01:31:29.703 --> 01:31:33.143
“Mother, am I the Spirit?” Ask the question three times.

01:31:33.343 --> 01:31:37.063
Those who got Realization yesterday, should also ask again.

01:31:37.263 --> 01:31:40.303
Is the simple way to reawaken the Kundalini,

01:31:40.463 --> 01:31:43.423
to reestablish it properly.

01:31:49.983 --> 01:31:52.343
The other question that follows with it,

01:31:52.583 --> 01:31:54.543
that if you are the Spirit,

01:31:54.743 --> 01:31:56.943
you are your own guide,

01:31:57.103 --> 01:32:01.343
you are your own guru, you are your own master.

01:32:01.863 --> 01:32:04.463
So you put your right hand

01:32:04.703 --> 01:32:08.023
on thie center which is on the left hand side,

01:32:08.223 --> 01:32:13.143
in the upper part of your stomach,

01:32:13.343 --> 01:32:16.303
in the upper part of your abdomen.

01:32:16.943 --> 01:32:20.743
Please put your right hand there and left hand towards Me.

01:32:20.943 --> 01:32:24.223
Now this is a center of mastery.

01:32:24.703 --> 01:32:26.983
So here you have to ask a question to Me,

01:32:27.223 --> 01:32:30.103
“Mother, am I my own master?”

01:32:30.743 --> 01:32:32.783
"Am I my own Guru?” ,

01:32:32.982 --> 01:32:38.823
“Am I my own guide?” Ask a question, please, here, three times.

01:33:01.183 --> 01:33:04.023
Now take down this right hand,

01:33:04.223 --> 01:33:09.423
on the left hand side of your stomach, in the lower region,

01:33:09.943 --> 01:33:11.943
on the lower region and press it.

01:33:12.103 --> 01:33:15.103
Now this is a very-very... Face them.

01:33:15.303 --> 01:33:21.063
This is a very-very important center because through this center,

01:33:21.263 --> 01:33:26.023
we achieve the divine technique, we work out the divine technique.

01:33:26.663 --> 01:33:28.983
That’s the true knowledge, that’s the pure knowledge

01:33:29.183 --> 01:33:30.583
in Sanskrit called Shudha Vidya,

01:33:30.783 --> 01:33:34.663
that’s the true knowledge, the technique, the expertise.

01:33:34.863 --> 01:33:38.143
So for that I cannot force upon you this knowledge.

01:33:38.343 --> 01:33:40.383
You have to say you want it.

01:33:40.623 --> 01:33:45.783
So please say: “Mother, may I have the pure knowledge?”

01:33:45.982 --> 01:33:49.943
“Mother, may I have the true knowledge?” Please ask for it.

01:33:50.103 --> 01:33:52.743
I cannot force it on you, I cannot.

01:33:52.943 --> 01:33:57.703
So please ask for it: “Mother, may I have the pure knowledge,

01:33:57.903 --> 01:34:00.263
the true knowledge?”

01:34:01.303 --> 01:34:06.703
Six times, because this center has got six petals.

01:34:17.703 --> 01:34:20.343
SY: It's good. It`s coming.

01:34:20.943 --> 01:34:23.743
SM: Very good.
SY: It`s coming.

01:34:27.383 --> 01:34:30.743
Hold the light for the left hand.

01:34:38.823 --> 01:34:41.583
Please ask six times.

01:34:50.903 --> 01:34:53.063
There's a tension.

01:34:59.063 --> 01:35:01.623
Good?

01:35:03.303 --> 01:35:08.743
Now

01:35:08.943 --> 01:35:13.982
some people are laughing or... Please don’t do that.

01:35:14.143 --> 01:35:16.743
Because it won’t work out in you if you do that.

01:35:16.943 --> 01:35:19.943
It's not a sign of wisdom.

01:35:21.023 --> 01:35:24.023
It's not a sign. Please do not do that way.

01:35:24.223 --> 01:35:30.023
Is uncivil to other people. Try to control. Please try to control.

01:35:38.103 --> 01:35:42.423
Now raise the right hand again

01:35:42.663 --> 01:35:45.143
onto the upper part of the abdomen,

01:35:45.343 --> 01:35:47.903
on the left hand side, upper part.

01:35:48.783 --> 01:35:52.023
This is the center of the master, the guru.

01:35:52.982 --> 01:35:58.343
Here please say with full assertion,

01:35:58.783 --> 01:36:01.463
with full confidence within yourself,

01:36:01.743 --> 01:36:03.303
That is very important

01:36:03.463 --> 01:36:06.863
that you must now show your confidence for the Kundalini to rise,

01:36:07.023 --> 01:36:09.063
because the movement in the Kundalini has started

01:36:09.263 --> 01:36:10.823
which you will know very soon.

01:36:10.982 --> 01:36:15.343
So what you have to say, “Mother,

01:36:15.583 --> 01:36:18.423
I am my own master".

01:36:19.103 --> 01:36:23.303
Say with full confidence. “Mother, I am my own master.”

01:36:26.063 --> 01:36:27.183
Ten times,

01:36:27.383 --> 01:36:30.983
because this center has got ten petals, say it ten times.

01:36:32.623 --> 01:36:34.623
“Mother, I am my own master.”

01:36:34.823 --> 01:36:38.743
Please don’t disturb others when they are meditating. Be civil!

01:36:39.343 --> 01:36:41.743
Can wait for ten minutes. Just wait for ten minutes.

01:36:41.943 --> 01:36:43.783
Don’t disturb others.

01:36:45.103 --> 01:36:47.143
There’s something wrong that you cannot do it,

01:36:47.343 --> 01:36:50.383
so please keep quiet. At least keep quiet!

01:36:53.383 --> 01:36:55.743
Please say ten times,

01:36:57.903 --> 01:37:02.663
“Mother, I am my own guru, I am my own guide,

01:37:02.863 --> 01:37:07.263
I am my own master”, with full confidence in yourself.

01:37:17.703 --> 01:37:19.703
Ten times.

01:37:20.703 --> 01:37:24.783
It’s too much on the left, too much of conditioning I think.

01:37:42.023 --> 01:37:44.383
Now.

01:37:48.703 --> 01:37:52.463
Please raise your hand now to your heart.

01:37:55.383 --> 01:37:58.183
Now here on this center

01:37:58.383 --> 01:38:03.303
with all confidence in yourself, from your heart,

01:38:03.863 --> 01:38:05.463
you have to assert and say,

01:38:05.703 --> 01:38:08.903
“Mother, I am the Spirit”. Please say that!

01:38:09.823 --> 01:38:13.303
Twelve times. “Mother, I am the Spirit”,

01:38:13.463 --> 01:38:16.343
without any hesitation.

01:38:32.982 --> 01:38:35.463
“Mother, I am the Spirit.”

01:38:35.703 --> 01:38:38.943
Twelve times. “Mother, I am the Spirit.” Believe Me, you are!

01:38:39.103 --> 01:38:42.423
We have to just assert for the Kundalini to raise.

01:38:42.703 --> 01:38:46.863
Just assert, “Mother, I am the Spirit”. Please do it.

01:38:50.063 --> 01:38:52.943
It’s very simple, it is.

01:38:53.103 --> 01:38:55.982
You have to have faith in yourself.

01:39:01.783 --> 01:39:04.463
Good, it’s rising very well.

01:39:05.183 --> 01:39:07.983
Good!

01:39:16.703 --> 01:39:18.983
Raise this right hand now

01:39:19.183 --> 01:39:22.982
in the corner of the shoulder and the neck

01:39:23.143 --> 01:39:25.623
on the left hand side, from the front.

01:39:25.943 --> 01:39:30.703
Yes, just hold it tight. This is a very important center,

01:39:30.943 --> 01:39:34.863
which gets spoilt when you feel guilty for nothing at all.

01:39:35.023 --> 01:39:41.543
You get diseases like spondylitis, like arthritis, like angina,

01:39:41.743 --> 01:39:46.823
all kinds of funny diseases due to lethargic behavior come here

01:39:46.983 --> 01:39:49.943
So please,

01:39:50.103 --> 01:39:52.143
say it from your heart,

01:39:52.343 --> 01:39:56.983
believing in yourself, “Mother, I am not guilty.”

01:39:57.623 --> 01:40:00.583
As I have told you before, believe Me,

01:40:00.783 --> 01:40:03.863
God is the ocean of love.

01:40:04.143 --> 01:40:07.023
He is the ocean of compassion.

01:40:07.223 --> 01:40:11.303
But above all, He is the ocean of forgiveness,

01:40:11.463 --> 01:40:14.143
He’s the ocean of forgiveness.

01:40:14.343 --> 01:40:16.943
So please don’t condemn yourself at all,

01:40:17.103 --> 01:40:18.983
saying that "I am guilty" and this and that.

01:40:19.183 --> 01:40:21.823
This is the biggest hurdle one has to cross through.

01:40:21.982 --> 01:40:24.783
Please believe Me, you are not guilty at all!

01:40:24.982 --> 01:40:26.223
You are the temple of God

01:40:26.423 --> 01:40:28.743
and you have to become the light, that’s all.

01:40:28.943 --> 01:40:30.743
The light has to be put in that temple.

01:40:30.943 --> 01:40:34.103
So please do not condemn yourself. Forgive yourself!

01:40:35.943 --> 01:40:39.463
Say it please sixteen times. There are sixteen petals.

01:40:39.743 --> 01:40:41.943
But if you still think you are very guilty,

01:40:42.143 --> 01:40:43.823
then you have a punishment of saying it

01:40:43.983 --> 01:40:46.543
for108 times, is better,

01:40:46.743 --> 01:40:49.623
so that at least you get rid of the guilt,

01:40:50.223 --> 01:40:53.063
which is absolutely false and wrong.

01:40:53.263 --> 01:40:56.903
It doesn’t exist, it's mythical.

01:40:59.303 --> 01:41:02.583
Now better? Much better. Much better?

01:41:02.783 --> 01:41:05.383
SY: Cool, right too. The right is cool.

01:41:05.623 --> 01:41:09.063
Right side. But for that we don’t need light anymore.

01:41:09.463 --> 01:41:13.543
No more light then. We'll do with the water.

01:41:22.863 --> 01:41:25.463
Now, all right, they are clear.

01:41:27.023 --> 01:41:32.943
Now put the right hand on top of your forehead, across forehead,

01:41:33.103 --> 01:41:36.783
pushing it on both sides as we do it when we have headaches.

01:41:36.982 --> 01:41:38.823
Just put your hand there.

01:41:38.982 --> 01:41:41.383
Now at this point,

01:41:41.623 --> 01:41:46.982
we have to say, “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

01:41:47.423 --> 01:41:51.183
Now the explanation could be, some may say “It’s very difficult”.

01:41:51.383 --> 01:41:55.423
Many say like that “I’ll try”. But it is mythical.

01:41:55.663 --> 01:41:59.063
Whether you forgive or you don’t forgive, is all mythical.

01:41:59.303 --> 01:42:02.823
You don’t do anything about it, but when you don’t forgive,

01:42:02.982 --> 01:42:07.023
then you play into the hands of those who want to harm you.

01:42:07.223 --> 01:42:10.263
So don’t become weak like that. Just say, “I forgive”

01:42:10.463 --> 01:42:13.743
and you’ll feel the tension will go away. Say it from your heart!

01:42:13.943 --> 01:42:17.183
How many times is not the point. Say it from your heart.

01:42:17.383 --> 01:42:20.103
Just from your heart, “I forgive everyone”.

01:42:20.303 --> 01:42:24.863
The best way is to forgive everyone to get rid of all the problems.

01:42:25.343 --> 01:42:28.743
That’s the greatest weapon Christ has given us. We should use it.

01:42:28.943 --> 01:42:32.063
“Mother, I forgive everyone”.

01:42:37.423 --> 01:42:40.743
Now take this hand on the back side of your head

01:42:40.943 --> 01:42:43.223
and hold your optic globe, the back side.

01:42:43.423 --> 01:42:47.983
Hold it tide, it's very good for the eyesight, this center.

01:42:48.223 --> 01:42:50.063
Now the other side of it is,

01:42:50.263 --> 01:42:52.982
that the way you feel guilty, the way you cannot forgive

01:42:53.143 --> 01:42:56.663
is better that you ask God to forgive you, once for all.

01:42:56.863 --> 01:43:01.143
You say, “Oh, Lord, oh, Divine”

01:43:01.343 --> 01:43:03.783
- anything you want to address Him like -

01:43:03.982 --> 01:43:06.463
“if I have done anything wrong

01:43:06.703 --> 01:43:10.423
in the glory of Your name, please forgive me!”

01:43:28.943 --> 01:43:32.263
Now take this hand on top of your head, on the fontanel bone area.

01:43:32.463 --> 01:43:35.943
Now you are going to give yourself the baptism.

01:43:36.103 --> 01:43:39.703
I’m not touching you there. Just put your palm,

01:43:39.903 --> 01:43:43.383
pressed on this center,

01:43:43.623 --> 01:43:45.863
where you had the soft bone in your childhood,

01:43:46.023 --> 01:43:47.583
called the fontanel bone area.

01:43:47.783 --> 01:43:50.423
Now press it hard, seven times move it.

01:43:50.703 --> 01:43:53.903
At this point again I cannot force you.

01:43:54.063 --> 01:43:57.103
You have to ask for your Self Realization.

01:43:57.303 --> 01:44:00.743
So you have to say, “Mother, I want my Self Realization,

01:44:00.943 --> 01:44:03.143
please give me Self Realization”, seven times

01:44:03.343 --> 01:44:06.463
because as I told you there are seven chakras, all in the brain.

01:44:06.703 --> 01:44:08.543
So please say it.

01:44:59.982 --> 01:45:03.583
Now please take down your hand on your lap, carefully.

01:45:03.783 --> 01:45:06.463
Open your eyes very slowly and don’t think about it.

01:45:06.703 --> 01:45:07.783
You can do it now.

01:45:07.982 --> 01:45:10.743
You have reached that state where you do not think.

01:45:10.943 --> 01:45:14.183
Now, take your left hand and see for yourself

01:45:14.383 --> 01:45:17.423
if there’s a cool breeze coming out of your head,

01:45:17.663 --> 01:45:20.863
on top, here, on the fontanel bone area

01:45:21.023 --> 01:45:23.303
about four inches, six inches above like that.

01:45:23.543 --> 01:45:25.943
Move it up and down. You’ll find a cool breeze.

01:45:26.103 --> 01:45:29.663
In front, in front. Little in front, not so much at the back.

01:45:29.863 --> 01:45:33.863
Here, it is here. It is here, here you feel.

01:45:36.063 --> 01:45:40.023
You can bend down your head if you like, and see for yourself.

01:45:42.463 --> 01:45:44.463
Pay attention here.

01:45:45.263 --> 01:45:46.663
Now with other hand.

01:45:46.863 --> 01:45:50.703
Put the left hand towards Me, please, and see with the right hand.

01:45:53.223 --> 01:45:55.223
It’s very subtle, it’s very subtle.

01:45:55.423 --> 01:45:57.903
Those who came yesterday, will definitely feel it.

01:45:58.063 --> 01:46:00.703
Even today they can, with little understanding.

01:46:00.903 --> 01:46:02.423
Again the other hand, please!

01:46:02.663 --> 01:46:05.983
The left hand on top and right hand towards Me, please!

01:46:07.623 --> 01:46:11.983
Is there? [Almost] there? Again see.

01:46:12.183 --> 01:46:15.143
See it’s coming out of your head, this is the real miracle,

01:46:15.343 --> 01:46:19.103
that you cannot do it otherwise. This is what one should expect.

01:46:19.383 --> 01:46:21.423
If they tell you to jump, scream,

01:46:21.663 --> 01:46:24.063
that’s anybody can do; change your clothes, anybody can do it.

01:46:24.263 --> 01:46:26.063
But see the cool breeze coming out of your head.

01:46:26.263 --> 01:46:29.463
Now, again, the other hand. Once more.

01:46:33.943 --> 01:46:36.943
Now, to feel it in the hands, the all-pervading Power

01:46:37.103 --> 01:46:40.982
best way is to put up your hands like this, in the sky, loosely,

01:46:41.143 --> 01:46:44.703
and put back your head, and spread out the hands and ask,

01:46:44.943 --> 01:46:47.783
“Is this the All-pervading
Power of God’s love?

01:46:47.982 --> 01:46:50.543
Is this the Brahma Shakti?”

01:46:53.143 --> 01:46:57.303
Three times ask, “Is this the power of the Holy Ghost?"

01:46:57.623 --> 01:47:00.103
"Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

01:47:03.783 --> 01:47:07.543
Now bring it down. Now feel it in your hands.

01:47:08.663 --> 01:47:13.663
Feeling very relaxed? Very relaxed. Feel it in your hands.

01:47:14.183 --> 01:47:18.063
See now, if you are feeling the cool breeze in your hand.

01:47:25.383 --> 01:47:26.903
All right?

01:47:27.063 --> 01:47:29.263
It's good.

01:47:30.423 --> 01:47:33.343
Now the last thing I want to tell you

01:47:33.583 --> 01:47:35.663
how to protect your auras, very important.

01:47:35.863 --> 01:47:37.583
And how to raise your Kundalini.

01:47:37.783 --> 01:47:39.263
This will take about 5 minutes,

01:47:39.463 --> 01:47:42.903
but you should do it before going to sleep. It’s very simple.

01:47:43.103 --> 01:47:45.023
But you must do it to protect yourself.

01:47:45.223 --> 01:47:47.863
It's very important to protect your auras.

01:47:48.063 --> 01:47:52.263
You know, when the disciples of Christ

01:47:52.463 --> 01:47:54.823
got their Realization through the Holy Ghost,

01:47:54.983 --> 01:47:56.863
they started using their hands

01:47:57.023 --> 01:47:59.383
in such a way that people thought they were mad

01:47:59.623 --> 01:48:02.903
and were using the language, that people did not understand.

01:48:03.063 --> 01:48:05.063
That was the language of the chakras

01:48:05.263 --> 01:48:08.143
and the hands were used to use the power.

01:48:08.343 --> 01:48:11.143
Now the left hand is towards Me. This is the end of it.

01:48:11.343 --> 01:48:14.183
Now put the right hand as...

01:48:14.383 --> 01:48:16.823
You just don’t face that, because they cannot see.

01:48:16.983 --> 01:48:19.023
So face that side, it's all right.

01:48:19.223 --> 01:48:22.223
Now this one is to be taken like that, on top of your head.

01:48:22.423 --> 01:48:24.063
So we’ll start it.

01:48:24.263 --> 01:48:27.982
One, to seven chakras we have to do seven times.

01:48:28.183 --> 01:48:30.823
Yes, two. It's very simple.

01:48:31.223 --> 01:48:34.023
This is you are giving. Three.

01:48:34.223 --> 01:48:37.063
Is four.

01:48:37.263 --> 01:48:41.063
Is five.

01:48:41.263 --> 01:48:44.623
Six. And seven.

01:48:44.823 --> 01:48:46.263
Now to increase your vibrations,

01:48:46.463 --> 01:48:48.703
you must know how to raise your Kundalini.

01:48:48.903 --> 01:48:52.303
To increase your vibrations is best to know, everyone should know,

01:48:52.463 --> 01:48:53.743
how to raise the Kundalini,

01:48:53.943 --> 01:48:56.063
which is a very simple thing to do again.

01:48:56.263 --> 01:49:00.023
With the left hand towards the Kundalini to be kept

01:49:00.223 --> 01:49:01.743
and to be watched all the time

01:49:01.943 --> 01:49:06.463
and the right hand is to be taken up, front, low, back

01:49:06.703 --> 01:49:10.223
like that a clockwise. So we have to move it upper on our head.

01:49:10.423 --> 01:49:11.943
Let’s do it!

01:49:12.103 --> 01:49:16.023
Move it upward. Push back your head, push back your hands

01:49:16.223 --> 01:49:20.303
and give it a twist. Give it a twist and now give it a knot..

01:49:20.543 --> 01:49:24.423
Once more. Again, do it thrice.

01:49:25.223 --> 01:49:29.783
Again we do it once more. Now it goes faster.

01:49:29.982 --> 01:49:32.703
Now give it a twist

01:49:32.903 --> 01:49:34.743
and give it a knot!

01:49:34.943 --> 01:49:37.583
In the third state we have to give three knots.

01:49:37.783 --> 01:49:41.423
Let’s do it once more! That’s all.

01:49:42.023 --> 01:49:45.743
Now see how it moves faster. Now push back your head!

01:49:45.943 --> 01:49:49.423
Give it one twist, give it another twist,

01:49:49.663 --> 01:49:50.982
and give it the third one.

01:49:51.143 --> 01:49:52.943
That’s how you tie your Kundalini up there.

01:49:53.103 --> 01:49:55.983
Now feel the cool breeze in your hands. Better?

01:50:00.943 --> 01:50:05.063
All right? It's better now?

01:50:09.583 --> 01:50:12.783
Some of you have not felt, doesn’t matter.

01:50:12.983 --> 01:50:15.223
Most of you have felt it. Let’s see how many have felt

01:50:15.423 --> 01:50:17.383
either in the head or in the hands or both.

01:50:17.623 --> 01:50:20.943
Just lift your hands like this, I would like to see.

01:50:22.623 --> 01:50:26.783
[Look at that], Australians, I bow to you all.

01:50:40.263 --> 01:50:42.743
So don’t discuss about it, don’t talk about it.

01:50:42.943 --> 01:50:45.383
Give yourself a bandhan, as we said the protection,

01:50:45.663 --> 01:50:47.743
and the raising of the Kundalini before sleeping.

01:50:47.943 --> 01:50:50.623
Put your attention here and I hope you’ll come Wednesday,

01:50:50.823 --> 01:50:54.103
for the workshop, where we’ll tell you more about it,

01:50:54.303 --> 01:50:56.903
and you will learn it very fast.

01:50:57.263 --> 01:51:01.143
