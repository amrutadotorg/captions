WEBVTT

00:02.379 --> 00:28.199
I am here to talk to you about a higher life
than what we know of, about a power that pervades,

00:28.199 --> 00:50.719
permeates, every other power; and about the
world which is called as the world of bliss

00:50.719 --> 00:54.400
and joy.

00:54.400 --> 01:01.940
You must have heard about all these words
before also.

01:01.940 --> 01:13.670
But I am here to tell you about the instrument
that resides within us, all nicely planted

01:13.670 --> 01:25.380
within our being, as clear as you see here
in the picture, which is a living instrument,

01:25.380 --> 01:39.350
which you can also see pulsating actually
with your own eyes when the Kundalini, this

01:39.350 --> 01:47.229
coiled energy, rises.

01:47.229 --> 02:01.329
We have already been blessed to have this
ascent into our own being, the breakthrough

02:01.329 --> 02:11.330
into the unconscious, to enter into another
new dimension all together in our awareness

02:11.330 --> 02:23.210
by which we really can find out answers to
all your absolute questions.

02:23.210 --> 02:33.030
So far, in the ancient India, we had three
types of movements.

02:33.030 --> 02:37.420
I don’t know if you are aware of all of
them, but we had three types.

02:37.420 --> 03:03.030
And the reflections of that were manifesting
in that country, also in other countries.

03:03.030 --> 03:15.500
Even in England we have had people who have
been very busy finding out the answers to

03:15.500 --> 03:21.960
many fundamental questions, absolute questions.

03:21.960 --> 03:25.880
So the seeking has been everywhere in the
whole world.

03:25.880 --> 03:36.210
But, as I have told you before, India was
perhaps the best country, because of its climatic

03:36.210 --> 03:56.069
conditions, and because there was a lot of
scope for people to go into secluded places

03:56.069 --> 04:08.360
to find out the answer to their seeking.

04:08.360 --> 04:18.820
Today I would like to tell you the three methods,
or three ways, we have been seeking and the

04:18.820 --> 04:21.220
results of that.

04:21.220 --> 04:36.280
The first one is on the left-hand side: is
the path by which

04:36.280 --> 04:41.470
they had devotion to God, what they call the
bhakti.

04:41.470 --> 04:48.090
They sang praise of God without seeking Him.

04:48.090 --> 04:52.660
They called Him, they asked His help.

04:52.660 --> 05:05.210
In the beginning they thought that the greatest
challenge they have is from the elements;

05:05.210 --> 05:08.520
so they tried to overpower the elements.

05:08.520 --> 05:24.370
And in that overpowering of elements the movement
was on the right-hand side, in which they

05:24.370 --> 05:33.270
used many methods by which they could excite
or could innovate, as they call it, the deities

05:33.270 --> 05:42.590
or the subtle principles of the elements.

05:42.590 --> 05:48.830
The first one was that of the devotees and
the second one that of the people who were

05:48.830 --> 05:57.200
trying to find out the way to master the elements.

05:57.200 --> 06:13.600
The third one was in the centre and there
were two types of people who searched.

06:13.600 --> 06:23.080
I would say the one who searched, the another
which

06:23.080 --> 06:34.240
incarnated on this Earth to help, and this
was the evolutionary path of our ascent.

06:34.240 --> 06:47.620
The evolutionary path of our ascent came into
light, you will be amazed, much later than

06:47.620 --> 07:02.960
Krishna Himself came on this Earth, even after
Christ, people started talking about the methods

07:02.960 --> 07:05.460
of evolution within us.

07:05.460 --> 07:10.100
So we should have no confusion about these
three methods.

07:10.100 --> 07:24.090
Because of the bhakti of people, because of
the asking of the people, the different aspects

07:24.090 --> 07:30.360
of God descended on this Earth as incarnations.

07:30.360 --> 07:37.980
Whether all this I say is true or not, you
need not believe, because I am putting a hypothesis

07:37.980 --> 07:39.250
before you.

07:39.250 --> 07:45.150
And then later on you can find out if it is
true or not.

07:45.150 --> 07:55.259
You have to only keep your mind open like
a scientist to know about it.

07:55.259 --> 08:04.560
Now the middle path of evolution is the one
that we are going to discuss here.

08:04.560 --> 08:18.570
The one that deals with the mastering of the
nature, is the one they used in the Vedas

08:18.570 --> 08:29.389
where they did not mention even the deities,
they did not mention anything about God Almighty,

08:29.389 --> 08:42.500
but only talked of the Brahma Tattwa, the
one principle by which all the five elements

08:42.500 --> 08:45.040
are governed.

08:45.040 --> 08:58.930
And all those mantras and slokas, to excite
the elements, were recited just to get the

08:58.930 --> 09:06.880
benediction of these elements as well as the
control over them.

09:06.880 --> 09:19.250
So once upon a time, say, twelve thousand
years back, in India, we had pilotless bombs.

09:19.250 --> 09:25.370
We had instruments that could work out much
better than your missiles.

09:25.370 --> 09:34.680
They achieved it through this method of Right
Side innovation.

09:34.680 --> 09:41.930
When I went to Colombia I was so surprised
that they also used the Right Side methods.

09:41.930 --> 09:51.110
For that they used to also take a kind of
an intoxicant which we call ‘somras’ in

09:51.110 --> 09:52.110
India.

09:52.110 --> 10:01.160
It was an intoxicant which would not give
you a habit but would take you to a state

10:01.160 --> 10:09.899
where you could understand that there is beyond
something; you can say something like LSD

10:09.899 --> 10:11.450
maybe.

10:11.450 --> 10:18.490
But this LSD that you take is very different
from the one they used.

10:18.490 --> 10:25.880
It was, I should say, a holy thing which had
something to do with God; because whatever

10:25.880 --> 10:40.330
in India they tried to search, they kept the
centrifugal force acting on them, which was

10:40.330 --> 10:46.320
the assumption that there is God.

10:46.320 --> 10:51.440
So they did not deviate too much from the
Right Side.

10:51.440 --> 10:53.350
They did not go too far.

10:53.350 --> 11:00.529
As a result of that search, science came to
us.

11:00.529 --> 11:06.250
It came through the unconscious, all the discoveries.

11:06.250 --> 11:14.930
But our awareness – after all this world
is one whole – our awareness was tuned up

11:14.930 --> 11:19.300
to a point where we could understand science.

11:19.300 --> 11:33.779
As a result of that kind of innovation they
mastered a lot of things and they organised

11:33.779 --> 11:36.830
many wars as we are doing nowadays.

11:36.830 --> 11:45.300
And in those wars there are descriptions of
aeroplanes and all kinds of ayudha they call

11:45.300 --> 11:54.560
it weapons, which are fantastic.

11:54.560 --> 11:59.930
But there was another movement going on, on
the left-hand side where people did not care

11:59.930 --> 12:01.420
for all these things.

12:01.420 --> 12:08.250
This was meant for the kshatriyas, the kings,
who were very ambitious and wanted to overpower

12:08.250 --> 12:09.269
the whole world.

12:09.269 --> 12:17.670
But the Left Side gentry, I would say, the
people who were dedicated to God, who always

12:17.670 --> 12:33.110
asked for the help of God, were busy organizing
dedications and what we call worships, pujas,

12:33.110 --> 12:40.269
according to their own understanding.

12:40.269 --> 12:58.740
But the central path was looked after by two
forces: The first one those who were the seekers

12:58.740 --> 13:06.180
under some gurus, who were realised souls
of a very high level.

13:06.180 --> 13:17.220
And the other were the incarnations who came
on this Earth to protect, to save, the devotees

13:17.220 --> 13:22.269
of God.

13:22.269 --> 13:30.830
This movement was very secretive in the beginning,
extremely secretive.

13:30.830 --> 13:39.850
Only one or two people they would employ to
this kind of work from the whole society.

13:39.850 --> 13:49.860
In one generation you could hardly find five
or six people doing this work of evolving

13:49.860 --> 13:51.410
people into new awareness.

13:51.410 --> 14:02.220
This I am telling you before the time even
Vedas were written.

14:02.220 --> 14:11.740
Because the incarnations that were to come,
who had not established, were kept as a very

14:11.740 --> 14:13.610
guarded secret.

14:13.610 --> 14:19.709
The reason was that if they had disclosed
that these are the incarnations who are going

14:19.709 --> 14:28.660
to come then the negative forces, which were
trying to pull down the evolution, would organise

14:28.660 --> 14:40.070
a method by which they would destroy these
incarnations before their coming.

14:40.070 --> 14:49.700
But still, as you can see in the life of Christ,
that coming of Christ was declared much before

14:49.700 --> 14:56.649
Christ came in by the prophets who made prophecies.

14:56.649 --> 15:02.890
All these prophets belong to the category
of the Gurus I am talking about.

15:02.890 --> 15:07.810
So all over the world three types of movements
were on.

15:07.810 --> 15:13.680
For example the scientists on the right-hand
side, we can say, and the left-hand side are

15:13.680 --> 15:17.769
the devotees of God who sing the praise of
God.

15:17.769 --> 15:27.411
And in the centre there were people like Moses,
like Abraham, who came on this Earth just

15:27.411 --> 15:36.399
to prophecies, just to protect the devotees
of God.

15:36.399 --> 15:48.279
Now this middle movement of evolution today
has reached its peak, because all the incarnations

15:48.279 --> 15:52.250
have arrived now and have done their job within
you.

15:52.250 --> 15:59.880
They have occupied their position within you,
in your awareness, on these different centres.

15:59.880 --> 16:17.320
So the first centre that we have here which
is established in the carbon atom.

16:17.320 --> 16:22.410
Carbon has got four hands in the same way
this centre has also got four hands.

16:22.410 --> 16:29.760
You can see the four sides of this centre.

16:29.760 --> 16:35.209
That means up to the matter stage it is even
below that.

16:35.209 --> 16:40.510
Then the carbon started the living.

16:40.510 --> 16:51.420
This carbon atom actually ignited the living
process in the matter.

16:51.420 --> 17:00.829
Though the time taken for this, since the
time the Earth seceded from the sun, is very,

17:00.829 --> 17:02.440
very short.

17:02.440 --> 17:11.010
I mean nobody can explain why and how it could
happen: some Juggler could only do that job.

17:11.010 --> 17:24.549
So this carbon atom started the triggering
of living beings.

17:24.549 --> 17:39.620
Afterwards, we can say that the incarnation
of the centre, this green coloured centre,

17:39.620 --> 17:55.990
which we call as the Nabhi Chakra – the
incarnations started on this point, one after

17:55.990 --> 18:04.350
another taking different forms of living animals
in the evolution.

18:04.350 --> 18:06.620
Like first the fish.

18:06.620 --> 18:12.110
It came as a fish.

18:12.110 --> 18:18.720
They say when Noah was having a bad time with
the deluge this fish helped him.

18:18.720 --> 18:23.900
They came as an incarnation, that aspect of
God which we call as evolutionary.

18:23.900 --> 18:30.760
That came as a fish on this Earth and then
it came as quadruped.

18:30.760 --> 18:35.380
Then it came as a short man.

18:35.380 --> 18:43.230
It came as a strong man and on and on and
on like that till we reached a stage where

18:43.230 --> 18:45.640
the top one you can see, over here.

18:45.640 --> 18:51.410
This is the stage where Shri Ram, who came
eight-thousand years back.

18:51.410 --> 18:56.690
This was established within us like a milestone.

18:56.690 --> 19:01.820
They were the leaders of our evolution.

19:01.820 --> 19:08.030
They led us into evolution as well as they
left a mark for us there and they exist within

19:08.030 --> 19:09.400
us in that path.

19:09.400 --> 19:17.990
So on the right side of the centre, this is
called as the Heart Chakra, as you can call

19:17.990 --> 19:23.600
it Cardiac Chakra or we call it as Hridya
Chakra in Sanskrit language.

19:23.600 --> 19:26.070
On the right-hand side appeared Shri Ram.

19:26.070 --> 19:35.280
Now why did He appear, Shri Ram, on the right-hand
side, because He was to forget about His incarnation.

19:35.280 --> 19:42.750
He was to forget that, in essence, He is the
evolutionary aspect of God which is Shri Vishnu,

19:42.750 --> 19:48.210
who resides in the centre here, because He
was somewhere in different forms.

19:48.210 --> 19:50.910
So He was to forget about it.

19:50.910 --> 19:58.049
He had to behave just like a human being so
that no human being suspects Him to be an

19:58.049 --> 19:59.049
incarnation.

19:59.049 --> 20:06.360
He became a king, a benevolent king, an ideal
king, with all the limitations of a king and

20:06.360 --> 20:08.059
the beauty of a king.

20:08.059 --> 20:14.169
And that’s how this incarnation came on
this Earth about eight-thousand years back.

20:14.169 --> 20:25.750
At the same time when this centre which is
the we call it as Void, but you can call it

20:25.750 --> 20:38.280
as the whole universe, you can say; this was
full of people who were negative and were

20:38.280 --> 20:43.770
trying to destroy the devotees of God.

20:43.770 --> 20:52.751
Then the Primordial Power which is called
as the Adishakti, the primordial Mother, She

20:52.751 --> 20:58.200
came at that centre, much earlier than Rama.

20:58.200 --> 21:07.059
She came there about twelve-thousand years
back to protect these devotees, from twelve

21:07.059 --> 21:09.440
thousand years, in one thousand incarnations.

21:09.440 --> 21:15.820
Of course, I think there have been much more
but one thousand are the main incarnations

21:15.820 --> 21:25.780
which came on this Earth as Primordial Mother,
they came to protect Her children, Her devotees.

21:25.780 --> 21:40.160
Now the topmost one, not the topmost but the
second one, this centre is the centre where

21:40.160 --> 21:48.840
the Vishnu Tattwa, or the evolutionary aspect
of the God, completely manifested.

21:48.840 --> 21:57.929
The complete manifestation of this principle
took place, and that is the principle of Shri

21:57.929 --> 21:58.929
Krishna.

21:58.929 --> 22:07.400
So Shri Krishna is regarded as the complete
manifestation of this evolutionary process.

22:07.400 --> 22:09.549
But God Almighty as we know Him is everything.

22:09.549 --> 22:17.010
He is not only the evolutionary principle,
He’s also the existence on the left-hand

22:17.010 --> 22:23.919
side and He’s also the Creator on the right-hand
side.

22:23.919 --> 22:31.080
But much before all this started another state
of awareness was there.

22:31.080 --> 22:37.970
In that state of awareness this second centre
that you see here is the Creator’s.

22:37.970 --> 22:50.039
He created, through His powers, all the universe,
through all the elements; then this Earth.

22:50.039 --> 22:57.160
And on this Earth the cycle of life started.

22:57.160 --> 23:01.840
All these centres are within us.

23:01.840 --> 23:16.970
Now last of all, about two thousand years
back, came the greatest incarnation of Christ.

23:16.970 --> 23:22.559
He was the son of God, the innocence.

23:22.559 --> 23:24.020
And He came on this Earth.

23:24.020 --> 23:32.030
At this point where you see this red mark,
behind, in the brain.

23:32.030 --> 23:40.679
Between the pituitary and the pineal there’s
a very subtle centre, He came there: for us

23:40.679 --> 23:51.570
to ascend, to us give the knowledge of the
eternal life, to give the knowledge that whatever

23:51.570 --> 23:58.039
you see on this Earth is not the permanent
thing, there’s something beyond.

23:58.039 --> 24:04.630
And in His resurrection He showed us how we
all can be resurrected.

24:04.630 --> 24:17.750
This was the gate into the limbic area, what
we call as the Sahasrara, because it has got

24:17.750 --> 24:20.010
one thousand petals.

24:20.010 --> 24:28.980
Now these petals, as they look like this lotus,
it is actually like that within us, but in

24:28.980 --> 24:30.730
a sleeping state.

24:30.730 --> 24:32.559
You can see a candle.

24:32.559 --> 24:38.919
Now when the wick is there, you don’t see
this form of the wick.

24:38.919 --> 24:44.350
Only when it is enlightened you see them in
that form.

24:44.350 --> 24:50.780
Now when you put one thousand like that they
all put together look like a lotus.

24:50.780 --> 24:56.600
But when it is not enlightened, you only say
there are one thousand nerves but when these

24:56.600 --> 25:02.480
nerves are enlightened, you can see the light
which is in different colours.

25:02.480 --> 25:15.419
So today we are here to know that, within
us, all these incarnations exist, and the

25:15.419 --> 25:24.809
force that really brought forth, really manifested
– who lived like human beings, and worked

25:24.809 --> 25:34.690
like gurus – that force which existed in
this area, which created religion within us.

25:34.690 --> 25:40.460
Religion as we understand, organised religion,
is not the religion.

25:40.460 --> 25:43.770
But the religion means your sustaining power.

25:43.770 --> 25:51.010
You are a human being because there are ten
sustaining powers within you.

25:51.010 --> 26:00.600
So they came to sustain us and to give us
full idea about these ten powers and to establish

26:00.600 --> 26:04.490
us in our religion as a human being.

26:04.490 --> 26:14.539
So these Gurus, who lived in that area, worked
out the sustain and helped us.

26:14.539 --> 26:22.950
And this is one of the greatest forces we
have got, which resides within us.

26:22.950 --> 26:27.760
And whatever they have said has a very great
meaning.

26:27.760 --> 26:35.940
Actually we should say the main Gurus are
ten, but there are many other gurus.

26:35.940 --> 26:46.280
And these ten Gurus could be described as
Raja Janaka, then Moses, Abraham, and in modern

26:46.280 --> 26:53.620
times you can say Mohammed Sahib and even
up to Shirdi Sainath in Shirdi that force

26:53.620 --> 26:57.120
came in for a short time, and then He disappeared.

26:57.120 --> 27:03.860
Nobody knows how He came there, He lived there
and He died.

27:03.860 --> 27:11.370
Also if you know Nanaka, He was also the same
force, the same Primordial Master, who was

27:11.370 --> 27:14.130
born on this Earth.

27:14.130 --> 27:21.490
Now this is not the time to tell about individual
people, but I think one day I will talk to

27:21.490 --> 27:25.029
you only on this subject of the Gurus.

27:25.029 --> 27:35.429
So these Gurus first started under the Primordial
Master Himself, who was called as Dattatreya.

27:35.429 --> 27:45.870
And this Dattatreya is the one who is comprising
all these forces: the existence force and

27:45.870 --> 27:51.600
the evolutionary force and the creative force,
all of them, in its innocence.

27:51.600 --> 27:58.200
I don’t know if you understand it, but there’s
a story about them, that there are three deities

27:58.200 --> 28:01.720
which belong to these three forces.

28:01.720 --> 28:09.630
The left one is Shiva’s force, then the
right one is Brahmadeva’s force and the

28:09.630 --> 28:12.980
centre one is Vishnu’s force.

28:12.980 --> 28:22.300
So they say that all these three Gods felt
that the wife of Dattatreya was a great, devoted

28:22.300 --> 28:23.300
woman.

28:23.300 --> 28:28.779
And she, with her powers could curse anyone
she feels like.

28:28.779 --> 28:37.890
So they wanted to take her test and wanted
to find out how far she was a devoted wife,

28:37.890 --> 28:44.710
so they went to her and they told her that:
“We want some alms."

28:44.710 --> 28:50.720
And in India, it is regarded as a great honour
to be able to give somebody alms who come

28:50.720 --> 28:51.720
to your house.

28:51.720 --> 28:55.900
And three saints, they were dressed up saints,
they came to the door.

28:55.900 --> 29:01.250
So when they asked for alms, she said, “All
right, I will get you some alms."

29:01.250 --> 29:07.700
They said, “No, we’ll come inside the
house, and you have to become completely naked

29:07.700 --> 29:09.799
and then give us the alms."

29:09.799 --> 29:14.980
Because to become naked before a man, you
lose all your powers as a devoted wife, as

29:14.980 --> 29:15.980
a sati.

29:15.980 --> 29:18.460
She said, “All right, if you say so, I will
do it."

29:18.460 --> 29:20.740
And she started taking out her clothes.

29:20.740 --> 29:26.900
As soon as she touched her clothes they became
small children, absolutely small children,

29:26.900 --> 29:30.440
and she took out her clothes and gave them
the alms.

29:30.440 --> 29:36.909
So these three small children put together
make the Dattatreya, is the Guru, is the one

29:36.909 --> 29:44.809
who is innocent like a child, innocent like
a child, who has no sense of sex.

29:44.809 --> 29:50.910
So we come to a conclusion a guru who has
interest in women, a guru who has interest

29:50.910 --> 29:56.780
in sex, is not a guru but is anti-guru.

29:56.780 --> 30:06.279
Dattatreya is the innocence of all these three
powers and this Guru was the one who then

30:06.279 --> 30:08.919
had a big tradition of gurus.

30:08.919 --> 30:15.740
In the same tradition we had many gurus in
our country and specially in the area near

30:15.740 --> 30:17.830
Bombay, which is called as Maharastra.

30:17.830 --> 30:23.240
They came as Nath, they were called as Nath.

30:23.240 --> 30:29.950
So the first one was Adi Nath, then Dattatreya,
then Macchindernath, then Gorakhnath, like

30:29.950 --> 30:32.299
that a tradition of these gurus came.

30:32.299 --> 30:38.510
But all their knowledge was kept as a guarded
secret, it was a gupta vidya, is absolutely

30:38.510 --> 30:42.450
guarded secret, a secret knowledge about Kundalini.

30:42.450 --> 30:47.010
They never talked about it; they never told
about it, because they thought that, “Just

30:47.010 --> 30:53.340
now let us experiment with it fully and then
we will give some idea about it to people."

30:53.340 --> 30:58.490
But as you see everywhere it happens, even
it happens with us here sometimes, that we

30:58.490 --> 31:04.909
get people who do not get Realisation or are
half-baked and they cannot rise much higher.

31:04.909 --> 31:11.230
Then they get very angry or sometimes they
take this half-baked knowledge and start working

31:11.230 --> 31:16.000
on it and they go absolutely wrong on this
side or that side.

31:16.000 --> 31:22.240
All such horrible gurus came up in those days
also, but they were neutralised because I

31:22.240 --> 31:27.390
would say that people were spiritually a very
very sensitive.

31:27.390 --> 31:29.370
Nowadays, the people are not.

31:29.370 --> 31:30.650
They are very naive.

31:30.650 --> 31:32.279
They have no sensitivity.

31:32.279 --> 31:36.860
You see from the face you can make out that
a person is such and such, but they have no

31:36.860 --> 31:37.860
sensitivity left.

31:37.860 --> 31:40.669
You see they are so much used to masks.

31:40.669 --> 31:48.400
I asked, “Today why people cannot understand
and why do they always have a mask on the

31:48.400 --> 31:49.400
faces?

31:49.400 --> 31:51.470
Nothing is beaming out of them, what is it?”

31:51.470 --> 31:56.510
So one told me a very interesting answer:
was that because they listen to news and they

31:56.510 --> 32:01.050
see that the newsman is reading it and he
gets lot of light on his face, so he has to

32:01.050 --> 32:05.919
keep detached from the news, he cannot show
his any impressions or anything.

32:05.919 --> 32:10.340
He has to be absolutely detached when he is
describing some news.

32:10.340 --> 32:14.370
So his face is just like a mask and that is
why it happens.

32:14.370 --> 32:20.720
Whatever it is, we have become really naive
as far as spirituality is concerned, and the

32:20.720 --> 32:28.380
people take advantage of it: a full advantage
of this naive behavior or naive nature of

32:28.380 --> 32:29.420
others.

32:29.420 --> 32:35.190
For this you don’t have to go to books,
you don’t have to go to any guru for this.

32:35.190 --> 32:40.450
It’s only a thing of the society in which
you live.

32:40.450 --> 32:46.870
Natural societies have much more sensitivity
to spirituality than artificially sort of

32:46.870 --> 32:53.049
brainwashed, you can call them, or brought
up in a materialistic atmosphere.

32:53.049 --> 32:59.900
They lose their sensitivity to spirituality
which is spontaneous, which is spontaneous;

32:59.900 --> 33:09.730
because we lose our spontaneity, we lose that
natural – we call it as ‘Sahaja’, means

33:09.730 --> 33:18.880
‘the spontaneous knowledge’ – to know
who is a real person and who is unreal.

33:18.880 --> 33:32.570
So this force started manifesting itself gradually
in the caves, in the very secret caves where

33:32.570 --> 33:35.960
only one or two were asked to go there.

33:35.960 --> 33:38.770
And first they were tested very badly.

33:38.770 --> 33:41.789
I mean the way they were tested some would
run away!

33:41.789 --> 33:46.409
So for years together they would not get even
one disciple who was capable of coming into

33:46.409 --> 33:49.289
this training.

33:49.289 --> 33:55.280
And at long last if they got one, they would
work on him and then he may die without the

33:55.280 --> 33:56.280
experience.

33:56.280 --> 34:03.250
Then again he would be reborn, again he would
die, like that it would go on for ages until

34:03.250 --> 34:16.339
then they found that the truth is within you,
till they completely cleansed themselves and

34:16.339 --> 34:22.389
they became one with the Higher Being within
themselves.

34:22.389 --> 34:30.879
But this was achieved so little that you will
be amazed that Zen system of religion is exactly

34:30.879 --> 34:35.980
the same system, is avadhuta, which we call
the Nath style, the same style is.

34:35.980 --> 34:42.649
And they say there have been only sixty-five
Kashyapas, they call them, Kashyapas.

34:42.649 --> 34:44.960
Sixty-five, just imagine!

34:44.960 --> 34:47.359
Sixty-five in six centuries!

34:47.359 --> 34:55.809
So I think it would be one point something
one every century!

34:55.809 --> 34:58.940
So these were the only people who got Realisation.

34:58.940 --> 35:05.079
And it was a very difficult procedure because
they would raise this Kundalini up to a point

35:05.079 --> 35:06.079
and it would drop out.

35:06.079 --> 35:10.944
Then they would raise it and cleanse it and
then again cleanse it and again push it forward.

35:10.944 --> 35:17.549
It would be something like pushing a car which
doesn’t start: you push it, it comes back,

35:17.549 --> 35:19.299
again it goes forward, it’s cut.

35:19.299 --> 35:22.630
Then again you cleanse it and take it to the
garage, you see it’s no good.

35:22.630 --> 35:28.420
Then you take it again back, wash it, clean
it, again get under it and try to cleanse

35:28.420 --> 35:30.630
it again, the machinery, again it goes out.

35:30.630 --> 35:35.650
Like that it goes on and on and you get so
fed up that you think, “Better let it go

35:35.650 --> 35:39.670
back to the factory to be completely renewed."

35:39.670 --> 35:50.289
Then they made it again, put it back and like
that it moved, the movement of this evolution,

35:50.289 --> 35:52.780
very, very gradually.

35:52.780 --> 35:58.309
And in this gradual movement they had…because
if you move gradually you see many things.

35:58.309 --> 36:03.589
For example, if you are now going on a bullock
cart – you don’t have any bullock carts,

36:03.589 --> 36:05.380
we still have bullock carts.

36:05.380 --> 36:09.729
If you have to go to villages, you have to
go by bullock carts.

36:09.729 --> 36:18.009
And the speed of a bullock cart is maybe two
miles per hour or maybe even sometimes less,

36:18.009 --> 36:20.270
it depends on the whims of the bullocks, you
see.

36:20.270 --> 36:25.849
If they sit down in between, you can get down,
cook your food and have your food very nicely,

36:25.849 --> 36:29.680
then again get back into the bullock cart
and then again start moving.

36:29.680 --> 36:32.440
It could be a very, very slow movement.

36:32.440 --> 36:39.309
And then when you stop, you get so bored of
that stay that you get out of bullock cart,

36:39.309 --> 36:40.980
you go around and see things.

36:40.980 --> 36:45.730
And that’s how they started seeing things
around and they described them, and poor things

36:45.730 --> 36:51.109
got sometimes so upset with it that they used
to get into tantrums and their tantrums also

36:51.109 --> 36:52.979
are nowadays called as ‘Raja Yoga’.

36:52.979 --> 36:58.279
I was so surprised that these tantrums were
there because of frustration and because of

36:58.279 --> 36:59.900
timing.

36:59.900 --> 37:07.190
But now, today, the condition is different
because the blossom time has come I say.

37:07.190 --> 37:14.529
The time has come that evolution has to be
en-masse, has to be en-masse.

37:14.529 --> 37:19.799
Actually this en-masse evolution has started
much earlier as I said, from the sixth century

37:19.799 --> 37:22.469
when Adi Shankaracharya started writing about
it.

37:22.469 --> 37:28.059
He was the one who proclaimed it, who said
that this is the force we have got, we have

37:28.059 --> 37:29.119
to work it out.

37:29.119 --> 37:32.420
Now people talk of Adi Shankaracharya and
not a word about Kundalini.

37:32.420 --> 37:35.119
What do you say to such a knowledge?

37:35.119 --> 37:48.380
You see this is the basis, the basis of Shankaracharya
is Kundalini, and the stai bhav is the emotion

37:48.380 --> 37:55.519
that substantiates it – is the complete
dedication to the guru.

37:55.519 --> 38:04.740
But the guru is has to be a real guru not
the way moneymaker or what you call this womaniser

38:04.740 --> 38:11.450
and all sorts of things, abuses, which are
absolutely never conceivable to a guru.

38:11.450 --> 38:15.910
He remains absolutely away from these things.

38:15.910 --> 38:20.039
All such things are I would say these are
meant for criminals.

38:20.039 --> 38:23.519
Or you can say, I have no words, but you can
say horrid people.

38:23.519 --> 38:33.819
It’s not meant for gurus, who are the choicest
flowers, who are the best people that God

38:33.819 --> 38:38.410
has created; who are the highest people above
all these things.

38:38.410 --> 38:44.969
They do not organise, they do not do anything,
they just sit and watch and they just impart

38:44.969 --> 38:49.029
you the power by which you become one with
God.

38:49.029 --> 38:50.509
That’s all their job is.

38:50.509 --> 38:58.650
They are not busy buying aeroplanes and Cadillacs
and some had some, I was told, Rolls Royces.

38:58.650 --> 39:00.880
They are not busy with.

39:00.880 --> 39:08.640
These gurus first took to sanyasa because
it was a very intensive work needed, very

39:08.640 --> 39:09.890
intensive work.

39:09.890 --> 39:15.829
In the early times they took absolute solitude
as their home and they didn’t have children,

39:15.829 --> 39:17.670
they didn’t have wives, nothing.

39:17.670 --> 39:20.349
They would just dedicate themselves to the
search.

39:20.349 --> 39:26.310
This is very early I am telling you, say twelve
thousand years back but about eight thousand

39:26.310 --> 39:31.519
years and at the time of Rama, all the gurus
practically were married.

39:31.519 --> 39:32.740
Most of the gurus were married.

39:32.740 --> 39:38.940
Imagine eight thousand years back, in modern
understanding people cannot even conceive

39:38.940 --> 39:41.009
of a priest who is married.

39:41.009 --> 39:44.380
They found out without the marriage the balance
is not established.

39:44.380 --> 39:52.289
You must lead a very sensible married life,
and they got married, and they had children

39:52.289 --> 40:00.279
and wife and they lived in the forest looking
after the small children from the family.

40:00.279 --> 40:06.849
And when the children came down there even
the grandparents came with them because according

40:06.849 --> 40:13.369
to the four ashramas we have got, the grandparents
are after fifty years of age have to go to

40:13.369 --> 40:16.869
the forest to live with the grandchildren
near the ashram.

40:16.869 --> 40:22.339
And they have to look after the children and
forget about married life.

40:22.339 --> 40:24.359
They have to finish it at that time.

40:24.359 --> 40:29.780
At fifty a grandfather is really promoted
and he looks after the children.

40:29.780 --> 40:35.910
He is not bothered about his married life
so much as the husband and wife reach their

40:35.910 --> 40:41.960
culmination of the beauty of their married
life and understanding from twenty-five to

40:41.960 --> 40:43.800
fifty years of age.

40:43.800 --> 40:50.359
So we have a division that till twenty-five
years is the education system then the twenty-five

40:50.359 --> 40:57.599
years of life is the married life and twenty-five
years of life is this life where, vanaprastra

40:57.599 --> 41:02.930
ashram they called it, where they had to live
like grand parents with their grandchildren,

41:02.930 --> 41:08.910
give them love and they looked after and also
if they were not realised or they wanted realisation,

41:08.910 --> 41:11.390
they worked for it.

41:11.390 --> 41:17.019
So in this system it was perfectly all right
because afterwards the husband and wife died

41:17.019 --> 41:22.539
after that age so they took to sanyasa, means
they just detached themselves and rose high.

41:22.539 --> 41:28.369
So the pattern of life was such that you had
to achieve God in your lifetime, you have

41:28.369 --> 41:33.130
to work for it and all of them aspired for
it and they worked for it.

41:33.130 --> 41:36.170
The whole life pattern was built up to that.

41:36.170 --> 41:41.729
Of course very few people got realisation
but they led a very righteous life so that

41:41.729 --> 41:46.609
they maintained it for the next life and again
they were born next time, they tried it from

41:46.609 --> 41:49.970
where they had lost, again they went up and
up like that.

41:49.970 --> 41:54.690
That was the system of that society which
is, of course is, now very much westernised

41:54.690 --> 41:59.549
and they think you people are much more successful
in life so they are running after you and

41:59.549 --> 42:01.079
try to become like you.

42:01.079 --> 42:04.079
But this is what it was.

42:04.079 --> 42:09.259
But we can see today that is not the situation,
we are in a very different situation.

42:09.259 --> 42:12.819
It’s a Ghor Kali Yuga they call it, where
righteousness has no place.

42:12.819 --> 42:15.650
If you talk of righteousness people will run
away.

42:15.650 --> 42:20.749
Like today, you see, they wanted to put up
an advertisement for some university, and

42:20.749 --> 42:24.999
the lady who was being there, she was telling,
“No, no, no don’t put Self-realisation."

42:24.999 --> 42:26.869
Then I said, “What should I put?”

42:26.869 --> 42:30.499
She said, “Put something like enjoying,
you see."

42:30.499 --> 42:31.940
“All right, enjoying.

42:31.940 --> 42:33.380
Then what else?”

42:33.380 --> 42:37.699
“You don’t talk of God, no, of righteousness,
no."

42:37.699 --> 42:42.200
Then should I say now I thought that you can
enjoy and come to a discotheque or something

42:42.200 --> 42:43.200
like that?

42:43.200 --> 42:47.180
Is that the way we are going to attract them?

42:47.180 --> 42:49.180
And then every other person got fed up.

42:49.180 --> 42:51.940
They said, “Mother, we are not going to
fall at their feet.

42:51.940 --> 42:59.420
We need really sensible people, people who
understand their value, who want to achieve

42:59.420 --> 43:03.959
something higher; they may be few but we cannot
manage with this frivolous people.

43:03.959 --> 43:06.700
We cannot do anything about these frivolous
people.

43:06.700 --> 43:08.380
Let them have one or two shocks in life.

43:08.380 --> 43:09.799
Then they’ll come to us."

43:09.799 --> 43:13.959
But you see, for a mother it is rather difficult
to think that “Let them have a shock.

43:13.959 --> 43:17.349
Let them put their hands in the electricity
so that they get a shock and next time they

43:17.349 --> 43:18.349
won’t do it."

43:18.349 --> 43:22.180
You see, for a mother it is rather difficult
to accept such a situation.

43:22.180 --> 43:25.809
But it is so, because we had another gentleman
who was a hippy.

43:25.809 --> 43:29.039
He came to me and I tried to give him realisation
this.

43:29.039 --> 43:32.999
Again he went back and he started his drugs
and he went into that.

43:32.999 --> 43:34.259
Again very seriously he did it.

43:34.259 --> 43:39.380
He did it very well that doctors declared
that he is going to die within twenty-four

43:39.380 --> 43:41.359
hours, you see he did the whole job very well.

43:41.359 --> 43:46.569
He had all the drugs within him, you could
open a chemist shop, you see, the way he was,

43:46.569 --> 43:49.349
and mounds of things he had in him.

43:49.349 --> 43:50.549
And then he came to me with a cirrhosis liver.

43:50.549 --> 43:52.460
Liver of, you see, liver which was having
cirrhosis.

43:52.460 --> 43:57.089
Thank God, my husband was not at home, so
I said, “All right, get in,” and he was

43:57.089 --> 43:59.329
there still when my husband came next day.

43:59.329 --> 44:03.690
He found him in an absolutely horrible condition.

44:03.690 --> 44:10.740
He said, “Now, if You have anything to do
with this young gentleman, if he dies here,

44:10.740 --> 44:14.289
the police will really arrest You, and You
will be in for murder.

44:14.289 --> 44:16.640
Now You please don’t go in for that."

44:16.640 --> 44:20.910
But we treated him and, you’ll be amazed,
within eight days he was perfectly all right

44:20.910 --> 44:22.950
and he’s such a great sahaja yogi today.

44:22.950 --> 44:25.309
Now he’s in Australia; I always remember
him.

44:25.309 --> 44:30.469
And you know, he was a professor of physics
and he was a very learned man, but he did

44:30.469 --> 44:39.479
all this tomfoolery just to go to hell directly
with a running jump, you see, and it was very

44:39.479 --> 44:41.819
difficult in the beginning to convince him.

44:41.819 --> 44:46.339
But later on, you see, what he told me was
most shocking because he told Me, “Mother,

44:46.339 --> 44:50.019
most of us have to be that way, otherwise
we’ll not come to You."

44:50.019 --> 44:55.859
Now this is too much for me to understand
that, that it should be so hard on anyone

44:55.859 --> 44:56.980
who are seeking.

44:56.980 --> 45:04.349
Now you will be amazed that the seekers who
were there at that time are today born more

45:04.349 --> 45:07.859
in the West than in the East.

45:07.859 --> 45:09.339
You are real seekers.

45:09.339 --> 45:14.709
Perhaps you have never evaluated yourself,
and you have lost that sensitivity to seeking.

45:14.709 --> 45:19.759
That is one thing true because the way you
have been guru-shopping, one can understand

45:19.759 --> 45:25.400
that how could it be possible that you have
been going from here to there not understanding

45:25.400 --> 45:26.400
this.

45:26.400 --> 45:31.660
But, you see, because you were seeking, I
would say, because you were seeking, you jumped

45:31.660 --> 45:38.480
onto someone, you jumped onto another one,
jumped onto third one, just to get the, what

45:38.480 --> 45:45.369
you call, the feeling that you were seeking.

45:45.369 --> 45:55.309
And this jumping from one to another has really
been very, very wrong because by that you

45:55.309 --> 45:57.940
have definitely disturbed your Kundalini.

45:57.940 --> 46:05.539
The most dangerous thing about these people
is that they disturbed the path of your Kundalini,

46:05.539 --> 46:09.460
which you will learn; when you will be realised,
you will know.

46:09.460 --> 46:15.920
All these gurus, apart from giving you diseases
like cancer and all that, have been destroying

46:15.920 --> 46:18.480
your chakras, destroying your Kundalini.

46:18.480 --> 46:20.839
I have seen big holes in your chakras.

46:20.839 --> 46:24.059
I have seen burnt portions in the Kundalini.

46:24.059 --> 46:31.630
I have seen horrible distortions and mutilations
of even the private parts of people because

46:31.630 --> 46:37.640
you can see on this chakra, this last chakra,
which is dealing with your private parts,

46:37.640 --> 46:44.329
you see, that they have really ruined you
completely, to such an extent that it is I

46:44.329 --> 46:53.000
feel irreparable, but still, we would try
our level best to work it out and to get it

46:53.000 --> 46:54.559
done.

46:54.559 --> 47:02.199
I would only request you to have an attitude
of openness and little relaxed.

47:02.199 --> 47:07.869
Like somebody has an appointment say about
seven o’clock, so he comes to attend my

47:07.869 --> 47:09.989
program – six to seven, Mataji’s lecture.

47:09.989 --> 47:12.299
Seven to eight, third lecture.

47:12.299 --> 47:14.099
Eight to nine, another lecture.

47:14.099 --> 47:17.329
Such a person is no good for Sahaja Yoga.

47:17.329 --> 47:25.220
You have to have patience with yourself and
you have to have patience with Sahaja Yoga

47:25.220 --> 47:31.249
too because some people from the jungles and
who are not in the open, who do not come to

47:31.249 --> 47:36.849
London or to America, these people have told
so many sahaja yogis that “We don’t know

47:36.849 --> 47:38.950
why Mataji is giving you these vibrations.

47:38.950 --> 47:40.009
What have you done?”

47:40.009 --> 47:43.729
All sorts of questions and they are quite
jealous and they don’t even understand how

47:43.729 --> 47:48.759
these sahaja yogis can raise the Kundalini
so easily.

47:48.759 --> 47:56.910
So one can say that it is happening and it
is there, you all should have it because you

47:56.910 --> 48:05.069
are the seekers and this blessing was to be
bestowed, is promised even in the Puranas

48:05.069 --> 48:12.940
it was said that in Kali Yuga those saints
who are seeking God in the hills and dales

48:12.940 --> 48:22.910
will be blessed in Kali Yuga, in this time,
modern times and they will be born as ordinary

48:22.910 --> 48:27.529
householders and they will get their ultimately
truth, it is a fact.

48:27.529 --> 48:29.299
You have to see it.

48:29.299 --> 48:33.329
And no use, I was told some people are coming
here for spying.

48:33.329 --> 48:35.410
I say, “What are they spying?”

48:35.410 --> 48:37.809
You see, this is for your good.

48:37.809 --> 48:40.449
What is there to spy in this thing?

48:40.449 --> 48:42.019
It is all very open.

48:42.019 --> 48:47.349
This is for your good, for your betterment,
for your own life.

48:47.349 --> 48:49.839
For whom are you spying?

48:49.839 --> 48:52.759
What are they going to give you, madness?

48:52.759 --> 48:56.790
They’ll take away all your money.

48:56.790 --> 48:59.449
As a mother I must tell you, you have to be
careful.

48:59.449 --> 49:05.329
They may pay you little money for spying but
what’s the use of loosing your spirit and

49:05.329 --> 49:09.329
getting that little money, all the false promises.

49:09.329 --> 49:16.650
Best thing is to get it within yourself, your
own powers and know yourself and know what

49:16.650 --> 49:23.499
is your self-interest and don’t be just
wasting yourself for all these nonsensical

49:23.499 --> 49:32.640
things like crusades and, what you call, stories
about it.

49:32.640 --> 49:38.869
People have misused all the knowledge that
was in the Bible, in the Quran, in the Vedas

49:38.869 --> 49:44.859
for exploiting others, it is something very
sad but human beings are like that, they are

49:44.859 --> 49:45.859
really like that.

49:45.859 --> 49:52.249
So we have to be very, very careful and we
have to understand that we have to have our

49:52.249 --> 49:53.619
own power.

49:53.619 --> 49:55.519
What is the use if I am very powerful?

49:55.519 --> 49:56.519
What’s the use?

49:56.519 --> 50:03.079
If the sun is very powerful, what’s the
use unless and until it does some good to

50:03.079 --> 50:04.079
us?

50:04.079 --> 50:10.219
If I have the power, say, to move all this,
what’s the use?

50:10.219 --> 50:11.219
You must have your powers.

50:11.219 --> 50:12.219
You must feel your powers.

50:12.219 --> 50:14.170
You should be able to exercise your powers.

50:14.170 --> 50:16.579
That is what you must ask.

50:16.579 --> 50:25.390
This is the main theme of Sahaja Yoga: that
it is your own power which starts manifesting.

50:25.390 --> 50:27.099
So, thank you very much.

50:27.099 --> 50:30.630
I hope the lecture was not too great for you.

50:30.630 --> 50:37.670
But today I was just thinking that today I
will tell you about this guru dynasty because

50:37.670 --> 50:40.700
this is the way the gurus are there by the
dozens.

50:40.700 --> 50:43.900
You must know that what is a real guru.

50:43.900 --> 50:46.699
And how they came in and what was their job.

50:46.699 --> 50:52.329
There’s one more point I would like to tell
you that……

50:52.329 --> 51:04.059
[UNCLEAR] here there are two more small chakras,
one that belongs to, which we call as the

51:04.059 --> 51:05.059
Surya.

51:05.059 --> 51:12.259
Surya is the, means the Sun, the Sun centre
and the another as the Moon centre on the

51:12.259 --> 51:13.319
left-hand side.

51:13.319 --> 51:25.859
And these two are governed or, we can say,
is bestowed upon by two great people who are

51:25.859 --> 51:29.069
the disciple elements.

51:29.069 --> 51:36.119
And disciple elements were first, were born
to Shri Rama and Shri Sita as the Luv and

51:36.119 --> 51:37.119
Kush.

51:37.119 --> 51:40.339
And then they incarnated many a times on this
Earth as disciple.

51:40.339 --> 51:48.769
One of them is, we can say, was Shankaracharya,
another was Kabira, like that.

51:48.769 --> 51:56.839
Then we can say, later on like, before Shankaracharya,
they came as Buddha and Mahavira.

51:56.839 --> 52:08.599
Then Shankaracharya and then I told you, after
Shankaracharya came the advent of Hassan and

52:08.599 --> 52:12.979
Hussain, who were the grandsons of Prophet.

52:12.979 --> 52:20.509
So these have been incarnating and they have
been moving from one side to another and telling

52:20.509 --> 52:24.960
people that “This is extreme, leave it,
this is extreme, leave it.

52:24.960 --> 52:27.930
Come in the centre and be in the centre."

52:27.930 --> 52:33.479
That has been their job and they are the ones
who are sort of imparting you that awareness

52:33.479 --> 52:35.469
by you become a perfect disciple.

52:35.469 --> 52:47.660
And this is a very important point because
it comes quite often that we do not understand:

52:47.660 --> 52:50.930
like Prophet Mohammad said that “I am the
last prophet."

52:50.930 --> 52:55.160
All right, He did say that He was the last
prophet.

52:55.160 --> 52:57.559
Supposing I say, I am the last person to come
here.

52:57.559 --> 53:01.439
All right I would say just to frighten you
that you better take to it otherwise this

53:01.439 --> 53:06.069
is the last time I am telling you.

53:06.069 --> 53:11.999
But it is never that because when He died
He found out that, you see, these people are

53:11.999 --> 53:12.999
mad caps.

53:12.999 --> 53:15.509
“I didn’t tell them this, what are they
doing out of Me?”

53:15.509 --> 53:20.030
So he said, “I better go back again,”
and He came as Nanaka and He told them that

53:20.030 --> 53:27.249
“Hindu and Muslims are same people, following
the same religion, why are you fighting among

53:27.249 --> 53:28.249
yourselves?”

53:28.249 --> 53:29.249
He came for that unity.

53:29.249 --> 53:36.030
Then as Nanaka He came; so in Nanaka’s system
also the Sikhism came in and they started

53:36.030 --> 53:37.890
a warrior class and this and that.

53:37.890 --> 53:43.210
I mean imagine, the Sikhism ended up by having
wars within Muslims and Hindus.

53:43.210 --> 53:45.990
So then He came as Shirdi Sai Nath to teach
them.

53:45.990 --> 53:50.519
Now this is not a very important thing that,
say Mohammad Sahib said, “I am the last."

53:50.519 --> 53:53.439
Say He is the last, all right, even take that
position.

53:53.439 --> 53:55.900
Who are you to him?

53:55.900 --> 53:56.900
How are you related?

53:56.900 --> 53:57.900
Through what?

53:57.900 --> 53:59.640
What is your authority?

53:59.640 --> 54:02.140
How do you appropriate Him to yourself?

54:02.140 --> 54:03.660
Because you say you are Muslims.

54:03.660 --> 54:04.660
So what?

54:04.660 --> 54:05.730
How did you become Muslims?

54:05.730 --> 54:08.630
Did you get your certificate from God?

54:08.630 --> 54:11.200
Like Christians are, you see.

54:11.200 --> 54:12.859
They say, “We are Christians."

54:12.859 --> 54:14.049
How are they?

54:14.049 --> 54:15.229
They are baptised.

54:15.229 --> 54:16.229
How?

54:16.229 --> 54:19.299
They go to church, somebody puts the hand.

54:19.299 --> 54:20.369
Who is he?

54:20.369 --> 54:22.299
Is he authorised by God?

54:22.299 --> 54:24.989
Does he really break your fontanel bone?

54:24.989 --> 54:26.920
Does he really blesses you?

54:26.920 --> 54:30.219
He is just appropriating God to himself.

54:30.219 --> 54:32.119
How are they concerned with God?

54:32.119 --> 54:33.269
I don’t understand.

54:33.269 --> 54:36.969
They are nowhere near Christ, I can see that
clearly.

54:36.969 --> 54:39.219
If they were, they would have been doing something
else.

54:39.219 --> 54:44.420
They would have given realisation to people
and giving them the second birth which Christ

54:44.420 --> 54:47.469
has told again and again that “You are to
be born again."

54:47.469 --> 54:52.049
I am talking of the eternal life, and not
this life of organizing churches and making

54:52.049 --> 54:56.930
profits so much so that the half of London
should belong to a church.

54:56.930 --> 55:03.029
Same with Hindus, another silly people.

55:03.029 --> 55:06.589
One would think they did not organise it so
it could not go further.

55:06.589 --> 55:09.930
Even there is one of the Shankaracharya’s,
he is trying to collect money.

55:09.930 --> 55:12.599
I said, “For what is he collecting the money,
this fellow?”

55:12.599 --> 55:13.650
They said, “Oh, no.

55:13.650 --> 55:18.660
He wants, now he is trying to, you see, sort
of, compete with your Pope."

55:18.660 --> 55:23.679
So he wants to begin with, he wants to have
an umbrella of gold, embedded with all precious

55:23.679 --> 55:24.679
stones.

55:24.679 --> 55:26.099
He’s a tiny little fellow.

55:26.099 --> 55:32.949
I don’t know how he is going to look with
that big umbrella around him.

55:32.949 --> 55:36.589
All such people claim.

55:36.589 --> 55:39.489
It is such a misappropriation.

55:39.489 --> 55:41.079
What is the authority you have got?

55:41.079 --> 55:42.739
This is something I can’t understand.

55:42.739 --> 55:44.779
Everybody goes to theological college.

55:44.779 --> 55:48.039
How can he learn God in the college?

55:48.039 --> 55:49.390
What college did Christ go?

55:49.390 --> 55:54.230
I mean of all the things, when you have Christ
before you why don’t you judge according

55:54.230 --> 55:55.230
to His standards?

55:55.230 --> 55:57.609
Which college did Christ go?

55:57.609 --> 55:59.130
Which theological college?

55:59.130 --> 56:04.749
If He had, if He was to come here, people
would say that He’s good for nothing.

56:04.749 --> 56:07.359
They may put Him in the prison again.

56:07.359 --> 56:13.559
And in America sure, because if you cure anybody
in America you are in the jail.

56:13.559 --> 56:15.660
That’s what it is.

56:15.660 --> 56:20.849
So the whole misappropriation has been worked
out.

56:20.849 --> 56:28.160
By this awareness, the vibratory awareness
you get after realisation, you will know that

56:28.160 --> 56:33.869
you cannot be misappropriated, by which you
become that.

56:33.869 --> 56:40.099
Once you become that, then you can feel it,
those vibrations flowing into you, you can

56:40.099 --> 56:50.519
feel your heart emitting those vibrations
because the Spirit is awakened and you can

56:50.519 --> 56:56.660
feel that and you get that vibratory awareness
by which, as you see on the hands, you can

56:56.660 --> 56:58.249
feel your chakras.

56:58.249 --> 57:03.000
That is Self-realisation: knowing about yourself
and also you know about others.

57:03.000 --> 57:06.259
It can happen just in a second, in a split
of a second.

57:06.259 --> 57:08.869
With some people it takes time, doesn’t
matter.

57:08.869 --> 57:11.820
I have patience, you have patience.

57:11.820 --> 57:14.729
I’m only for this job here and I am going
to be here for years.

57:14.729 --> 57:21.890
Now I hope so, for some years at least and
we are going to work it out.

57:21.890 --> 57:23.279
So thank you very much.

57:23.279 --> 57:28.229
Now if you have to ask any questions, please
ask me for a short time because then we should

57:28.229 --> 57:30.670
go to the workshop.

57:30.670 --> 57:38.209
Can I have some water please.

57:38.209 --> 57:44.489
Shri Mataji: Yes … little louder.

57:44.489 --> 57:47.009
Question: [INAUDIBLE]

57:47.009 --> 57:57.950
Shri Mataji: The coming incarnation is the
Kalki, as they call it, Kalki is the one which

57:57.950 --> 58:03.579
means nishkalanka, means the one which is
blemishless, there is no blemish on that person,

58:03.579 --> 58:05.740
you cannot put a blemish on Him.

58:05.740 --> 58:09.019
If you try to do it, you will be destroyed.

58:09.019 --> 58:14.689
But this One is going to come just to do the
last sorting-out.

58:14.689 --> 58:18.910
You won’t have anybody to persuade you,
to tell you that, “Get your realisation,”

58:18.910 --> 58:19.910
nothing of the kind.

58:19.910 --> 58:27.230
You see, He will just come as we have after
the whole harvest is done, then the last cutting

58:27.230 --> 58:28.230
of it.

58:28.230 --> 58:32.609
He is just coming for that; He is not going
to talk to you; He is not going to listen

58:32.609 --> 58:34.339
to you, nothing doing.

58:34.339 --> 58:41.859
The time from this to that is short, so you
better get yourself in the proper shape and

58:41.859 --> 58:45.349
don’t ask for His coming just now because
it will be very hasty.

58:45.349 --> 58:50.670
Just now let all of you be there in the boat
properly settled down, let us go onto the

58:50.670 --> 58:54.799
other side and then let Him come, because
He’s coming with eleven powers, which is

58:54.799 --> 58:56.489
known as Ekadasha Rudra.

58:56.489 --> 59:04.499
They are all placed here in the head of the
primordial being and He will be manifesting

59:04.499 --> 59:13.339
all these in such a tremendous manner that
you would not know how people will be destroyed,

59:13.339 --> 59:19.259
and the destruction will be of the worst type
that you have ever seen that’s why try to

59:19.259 --> 59:25.539
mature; became the fruits and be in the kingdom
of God.

59:25.539 --> 59:26.880
All right.

59:26.880 --> 59:28.219
Thank you.

59:28.219 --> 59:30.229
Yes, my child?

59:30.229 --> 59:33.589
Question: Who is Your guru?

59:33.589 --> 59:35.599
Shri Mataji: Nobody.

59:35.599 --> 59:37.309
I have no guru, I’m a mother.

59:37.309 --> 59:44.599
I don’t need any guru and I have been like
this since ages now.

59:44.599 --> 59:46.079
I’m very ancient.

59:46.079 --> 59:47.079
Question: [INAUDIBLE]

59:47.079 --> 59:49.529
Shri Mataji: That’s my own.

59:49.529 --> 59:58.150
I have no guru, neither I ever had, but I
have the guru, I call him as Dattatreya, if

59:58.150 --> 01:00:00.160
that is so, but that is also within Me.

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:02.390
In my stomach is the guru.

01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:07.539
You ask this question, “Mother, have You
any guru?”

01:00:07.539 --> 01:00:10.890
Just ask this question in your hand, and you
will know it.

01:00:10.890 --> 01:00:17.009
To know me is not so easy because I’m very
elusive, extremely elusive person you can

01:00:17.009 --> 01:00:18.939
think of, you see.

01:00:18.939 --> 01:00:22.109
So just now you just know yourself.

01:00:22.109 --> 01:00:23.109
All right?

01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:28.390
When you will have that awareness, you will
know Me.

01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:30.109
All right?

01:00:30.109 --> 01:00:31.839
Question: [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:31.839 --> 01:00:37.789
Shri Mataji: Because you don’t have those
eyes to know Me.

01:00:37.789 --> 01:00:39.809
Good question also.

01:00:39.809 --> 01:00:51.709
Who was the guru of Christ?

01:00:51.709 --> 01:00:53.609
Who was?

01:00:53.609 --> 01:00:59.329
His own mother.

01:00:59.329 --> 01:01:05.049
So, no questions?

01:01:05.049 --> 01:01:08.859
Question: [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:08.859 --> 01:01:14.579
Shri Mataji: Correct.

01:01:14.579 --> 01:01:28.119
Absolutely that’s what… very true, yes.

01:01:28.119 --> 01:01:30.450
No.

01:01:30.450 --> 01:01:32.779
Yeah.

01:01:32.779 --> 01:01:39.359
So what is your question in this?

01:01:39.359 --> 01:01:45.309
All right, I will tell you one thing that,
you see, if you go to these temples and places

01:01:45.309 --> 01:01:47.589
where you think that they are misappropriating
or not.

01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:53.960
Now as I have said to you already that the
job of a person who represents God or says

01:01:53.960 --> 01:02:00.380
that he is God or he has the power of God
within himself should do only one thing, is

01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:05.239
that he should be able to connect you with
God, that’s all, the rest of the things

01:02:05.239 --> 01:02:06.619
is absolutely useless.

01:02:06.619 --> 01:02:12.029
If he cannot connect you to God then he is
absolutely useless person.

01:02:12.029 --> 01:02:20.890
For example we get a person who says he is
the Secretary to the Queen, her Majesty the

01:02:20.890 --> 01:02:26.420
Queen, then he should be able to get at least
an appointment for us otherwise how are we

01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:29.099
to believe that they have any authority?

01:02:29.099 --> 01:02:35.459
Now if you say that people believe in things
and that ….[UNCLEAR] now, you see, believing

01:02:35.459 --> 01:02:41.579
into something has led you nowhere, see it
is blindness, on the contrary this kind of

01:02:41.579 --> 01:02:46.049
blindness has led to complete exploitation.

01:02:46.049 --> 01:02:50.859
You have seen in our country or in anywhere,
you are completely exploited.

01:02:50.859 --> 01:02:58.439
You do not realise it how much you are exploited
by these organisations which claim and appropriate

01:02:58.439 --> 01:03:03.589
that God is with them or sort of they are
serving the God.

01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:09.650
The only thing that they should do to find
out the ways and methods of connecting you

01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:10.829
to God.

01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:13.525
If they cannot do it then one should know
that there is something wrong with them.

01:03:13.525 --> 01:03:17.109
They have no authority of any kind.

01:03:17.109 --> 01:03:20.130
Question or comment: [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:23.160
Shri Mataji: Can organise?

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.869
No, not at all.

01:03:24.869 --> 01:03:25.869
They cannot.

01:03:25.869 --> 01:03:28.180
It’s a child’s play going on.

01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:29.259
They cannot.

01:03:29.259 --> 01:03:30.679
How can you.

01:03:30.679 --> 01:03:38.880
See it’s now but how can they You see, you
cannot organise God, you must have authority,

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:43.459
you should be a realised soul, minimum, connected
with God.

01:03:43.459 --> 01:03:48.009
Say, supposing this is not connected, all
right, with the mains.

01:03:48.009 --> 01:03:49.479
What can you organise it?

01:03:49.479 --> 01:03:51.809
You better put it down there, isn’t it?

01:03:51.809 --> 01:03:55.900
Otherwise you cannot use it.

01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:56.900
What else can you do?

01:03:56.900 --> 01:04:01.349
Supposing this is not connected with the mains,
it is not working, that’s all, simple.

01:04:01.349 --> 01:04:06.279
You try everything, you organise, you organise
a committee, bring many people to plan it,

01:04:06.279 --> 01:04:12.680
it won’t work out, unless and until you
connect it.

01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:19.239
So called, so called baptism is useless, but
the real baptism is there, the Kundalini rises,

01:04:19.239 --> 01:04:29.029
you will be surprised this portion becomes
absolutely soft here, just like a child.

01:04:29.029 --> 01:04:34.940
Actualisation is important, if they cannot
actualise it, what are they doing?

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:39.429
This is like, you see, you send an invitation
to people, “Please come and have dinner

01:04:39.429 --> 01:04:43.669
with us and come along and we have organised
a very good dinner and everything,” you

01:04:43.669 --> 01:04:47.319
go there you find a table very nicely laid
down and everything is there, they ask you

01:04:47.319 --> 01:04:52.339
sit on the chair and all that, and then they
will say “Will you eat?” and there’s

01:04:52.339 --> 01:04:54.859
no dinner, nothing, what means?

01:04:54.859 --> 01:04:57.569
They say, “It is very tasty dinner."

01:04:57.569 --> 01:05:00.400
Everybody looks at each other, “Yes, must
be."

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:04.919
You see, the one thinks that “Maybe we are
blind, you know, maybe that we are little

01:05:04.919 --> 01:05:05.919
foolish, we cannot do it."

01:05:05.919 --> 01:05:22.559
You see, so it would be like that, you see.
