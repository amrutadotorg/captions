00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:28.199
I am here to talk to you about a higher life
than what we know of, about a power that pervades,

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:50.719
permeates, every other power; and about the
world which is called as the world of bliss

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.400
and joy.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:01.940
You must have heard about all these words
before also.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:13.670
But I am here to tell you about the instrument
that resides within us, all nicely planted

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:25.380
within our being, as clear as you see here
in the picture, which is a living instrument,

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:39.350
which you can also see pulsating actually
with your own eyes when the Kundalini, this

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:47.229
coiled energy, rises.

00:01:47.229 --> 00:02:01.329
We have already been blessed to have this
ascent into our own being, the breakthrough

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:11.330
into the unconscious, to enter into another
new dimension all together in our awareness

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:23.210
by which we really can find out answers to
all your absolute questions.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:33.030
So far, in the ancient India, we had three
types of movements.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.420
I don’t know if you are aware of all of
them, but we had three types.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:03:03.030
And the reflections of that were manifesting
in that country, also in other countries.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:15.500
Even in England we have had people who have
been very busy finding out the answers to

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.960
many fundamental questions, absolute questions.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.880
So the seeking has been everywhere in the
whole world.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:36.210
But, as I have told you before, India was
perhaps the best country, because of its climatic

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:56.069
conditions, and because there was a lot of
scope for people to go into secluded places

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:08.360
to find out the answer to their seeking.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:18.820
Today I would like to tell you the three methods,
or three ways, we have been seeking and the

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.220
results of that.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:36.280
The first one is on the left-hand side: is
the path by which

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.470
they had devotion to God, what they call the
bhakti.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:48.090
They sang praise of God without seeking Him.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.660
They called Him, they asked His help.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:05:05.210
In the beginning they thought that the greatest
challenge they have is from the elements;

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.520
so they tried to overpower the elements.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:24.370
And in that overpowering of elements the movement
was on the right-hand side, in which they

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:33.270
used many methods by which they could excite
or could innovate, as they call it, the deities

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:42.590
or the subtle principles of the elements.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:48.830
The first one was that of the devotees and
the second one that of the people who were

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:57.200
trying to find out the way to master the elements.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:13.600
The third one was in the centre and there
were two types of people who searched.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:23.080
I would say the one who searched, the another
which

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:34.240
incarnated on this Earth to help, and this
was the evolutionary path of our ascent.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:47.620
The evolutionary path of our ascent came into
light, you will be amazed, much later than

00:06:47.620 --> 00:07:02.960
Krishna Himself came on this Earth, even after
Christ, people started talking about the methods

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.460
of evolution within us.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:10.100
So we should have no confusion about these
three methods.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:24.090
Because of the bhakti of people, because of
the asking of the people, the different aspects

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:30.360
of God descended on this Earth as incarnations.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:37.980
Whether all this I say is true or not, you
need not believe, because I am putting a hypothesis

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.250
before you.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:45.150
And then later on you can find out if it is
true or not.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:55.259
You have to only keep your mind open like
a scientist to know about it.

00:07:55.259 --> 00:08:04.560
Now the middle path of evolution is the one
that we are going to discuss here.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:18.570
The one that deals with the mastering of the
nature, is the one they used in the Vedas

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:29.389
where they did not mention even the deities,
they did not mention anything about God Almighty,

00:08:29.389 --> 00:08:42.500
but only talked of the Brahma Tattwa, the
one principle by which all the five elements

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.040
are governed.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:58.930
And all those mantras and slokas, to excite
the elements, were recited just to get the

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:06.880
benediction of these elements as well as the
control over them.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:19.250
So once upon a time, say, twelve thousand
years back, in India, we had pilotless bombs.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:25.370
We had instruments that could work out much
better than your missiles.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:34.680
They achieved it through this method of Right
Side innovation.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:41.930
When I went to Colombia I was so surprised
that they also used the Right Side methods.

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:51.110
For that they used to also take a kind of
an intoxicant which we call ‘somras’ in

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:52.110
India.

00:09:52.110 --> 00:10:01.160
It was an intoxicant which would not give
you a habit but would take you to a state

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:09.899
where you could understand that there is beyond
something; you can say something like LSD

00:10:09.899 --> 00:10:11.450
maybe.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:18.490
But this LSD that you take is very different
from the one they used.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:25.880
It was, I should say, a holy thing which had
something to do with God; because whatever

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:40.330
in India they tried to search, they kept the
centrifugal force acting on them, which was

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:46.320
the assumption that there is God.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:51.440
So they did not deviate too much from the
Right Side.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.350
They did not go too far.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:11:00.529
As a result of that search, science came to
us.

00:11:00.529 --> 00:11:06.250
It came through the unconscious, all the discoveries.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:14.930
But our awareness – after all this world
is one whole – our awareness was tuned up

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:19.300
to a point where we could understand science.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:33.779
As a result of that kind of innovation they
mastered a lot of things and they organised

00:11:33.779 --> 00:11:36.830
many wars as we are doing nowadays.

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:45.300
And in those wars there are descriptions of
aeroplanes and all kinds of ayudha they call

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:54.560
it weapons, which are fantastic.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:59.930
But there was another movement going on, on
the left-hand side where people did not care

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.420
for all these things.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:08.250
This was meant for the kshatriyas, the kings,
who were very ambitious and wanted to overpower

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:09.269
the whole world.

00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:17.670
But the Left Side gentry, I would say, the
people who were dedicated to God, who always

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:33.110
asked for the help of God, were busy organizing
dedications and what we call worships, pujas,

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:40.269
according to their own understanding.

00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:58.740
But the central path was looked after by two
forces: The first one those who were the seekers

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:06.180
under some gurus, who were realised souls
of a very high level.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:17.220
And the other were the incarnations who came
on this Earth to protect, to save, the devotees

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:22.269
of God.

00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:30.830
This movement was very secretive in the beginning,
extremely secretive.

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:39.850
Only one or two people they would employ to
this kind of work from the whole society.

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:49.860
In one generation you could hardly find five
or six people doing this work of evolving

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.410
people into new awareness.

00:13:51.410 --> 00:14:02.220
This I am telling you before the time even
Vedas were written.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:11.740
Because the incarnations that were to come,
who had not established, were kept as a very

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.610
guarded secret.

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:19.709
The reason was that if they had disclosed
that these are the incarnations who are going

00:14:19.709 --> 00:14:28.660
to come then the negative forces, which were
trying to pull down the evolution, would organise

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:40.070
a method by which they would destroy these
incarnations before their coming.

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:49.700
But still, as you can see in the life of Christ,
that coming of Christ was declared much before

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:56.649
Christ came in by the prophets who made prophecies.

00:14:56.649 --> 00:15:02.890
All these prophets belong to the category
of the Gurus I am talking about.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:07.810
So all over the world three types of movements
were on.

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:13.680
For example the scientists on the right-hand
side, we can say, and the left-hand side are

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:17.769
the devotees of God who sing the praise of
God.

00:15:17.769 --> 00:15:27.411
And in the centre there were people like Moses,
like Abraham, who came on this Earth just

00:15:27.411 --> 00:15:36.399
to prophecies, just to protect the devotees
of God.

00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:48.279
Now this middle movement of evolution today
has reached its peak, because all the incarnations

00:15:48.279 --> 00:15:52.250
have arrived now and have done their job within
you.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:59.880
They have occupied their position within you,
in your awareness, on these different centres.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:17.320
So the first centre that we have here which
is established in the carbon atom.

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:22.410
Carbon has got four hands in the same way
this centre has also got four hands.

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:29.760
You can see the four sides of this centre.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:35.209
That means up to the matter stage it is even
below that.

00:16:35.209 --> 00:16:40.510
Then the carbon started the living.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:51.420
This carbon atom actually ignited the living
process in the matter.

00:16:51.420 --> 00:17:00.829
Though the time taken for this, since the
time the Earth seceded from the sun, is very,

00:17:00.829 --> 00:17:02.440
very short.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:11.010
I mean nobody can explain why and how it could
happen: some Juggler could only do that job.

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:24.549
So this carbon atom started the triggering
of living beings.

00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:39.620
Afterwards, we can say that the incarnation
of the centre, this green coloured centre,

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:55.990
which we call as the Nabhi Chakra – the
incarnations started on this point, one after

00:17:55.990 --> 00:18:04.350
another taking different forms of living animals
in the evolution.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.620
Like first the fish.

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:12.110
It came as a fish.

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:18.720
They say when Noah was having a bad time with
the deluge this fish helped him.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:23.900
They came as an incarnation, that aspect of
God which we call as evolutionary.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:30.760
That came as a fish on this Earth and then
it came as quadruped.

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:35.380
Then it came as a short man.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:43.230
It came as a strong man and on and on and
on like that till we reached a stage where

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:45.640
the top one you can see, over here.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:51.410
This is the stage where Shri Ram, who came
eight-thousand years back.

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:56.690
This was established within us like a milestone.

00:18:56.690 --> 00:19:01.820
They were the leaders of our evolution.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:08.030
They led us into evolution as well as they
left a mark for us there and they exist within

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:09.400
us in that path.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:17.990
So on the right side of the centre, this is
called as the Heart Chakra, as you can call

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:23.600
it Cardiac Chakra or we call it as Hridya
Chakra in Sanskrit language.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.070
On the right-hand side appeared Shri Ram.

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:35.280
Now why did He appear, Shri Ram, on the right-hand
side, because He was to forget about His incarnation.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:42.750
He was to forget that, in essence, He is the
evolutionary aspect of God which is Shri Vishnu,

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:48.210
who resides in the centre here, because He
was somewhere in different forms.

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:50.910
So He was to forget about it.

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:58.049
He had to behave just like a human being so
that no human being suspects Him to be an

00:19:58.049 --> 00:19:59.049
incarnation.

00:19:59.049 --> 00:20:06.360
He became a king, a benevolent king, an ideal
king, with all the limitations of a king and

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.059
the beauty of a king.

00:20:08.059 --> 00:20:14.169
And that’s how this incarnation came on
this Earth about eight-thousand years back.

00:20:14.169 --> 00:20:25.750
At the same time when this centre which is
the we call it as Void, but you can call it

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:38.280
as the whole universe, you can say; this was
full of people who were negative and were

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:43.770
trying to destroy the devotees of God.

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:52.751
Then the Primordial Power which is called
as the Adishakti, the primordial Mother, She

00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:58.200
came at that centre, much earlier than Rama.

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:07.059
She came there about twelve-thousand years
back to protect these devotees, from twelve

00:21:07.059 --> 00:21:09.440
thousand years, in one thousand incarnations.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:15.820
Of course, I think there have been much more
but one thousand are the main incarnations

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:25.780
which came on this Earth as Primordial Mother,
they came to protect Her children, Her devotees.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:40.160
Now the topmost one, not the topmost but the
second one, this centre is the centre where

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:48.840
the Vishnu Tattwa, or the evolutionary aspect
of the God, completely manifested.

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:57.929
The complete manifestation of this principle
took place, and that is the principle of Shri

00:21:57.929 --> 00:21:58.929
Krishna.

00:21:58.929 --> 00:22:07.400
So Shri Krishna is regarded as the complete
manifestation of this evolutionary process.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.549
But God Almighty as we know Him is everything.

00:22:09.549 --> 00:22:17.010
He is not only the evolutionary principle,
He’s also the existence on the left-hand

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:23.919
side and He’s also the Creator on the right-hand
side.

00:22:23.919 --> 00:22:31.080
But much before all this started another state
of awareness was there.

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:37.970
In that state of awareness this second centre
that you see here is the Creator’s.

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:50.039
He created, through His powers, all the universe,
through all the elements; then this Earth.

00:22:50.039 --> 00:22:57.160
And on this Earth the cycle of life started.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:01.840
All these centres are within us.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:16.970
Now last of all, about two thousand years
back, came the greatest incarnation of Christ.

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:22.559
He was the son of God, the innocence.

00:23:22.559 --> 00:23:24.020
And He came on this Earth.

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:32.030
At this point where you see this red mark,
behind, in the brain.

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:40.679
Between the pituitary and the pineal there’s
a very subtle centre, He came there: for us

00:23:40.679 --> 00:23:51.570
to ascend, to us give the knowledge of the
eternal life, to give the knowledge that whatever

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:58.039
you see on this Earth is not the permanent
thing, there’s something beyond.

00:23:58.039 --> 00:24:04.630
And in His resurrection He showed us how we
all can be resurrected.

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:17.750
This was the gate into the limbic area, what
we call as the Sahasrara, because it has got

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:20.010
one thousand petals.

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:28.980
Now these petals, as they look like this lotus,
it is actually like that within us, but in

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:30.730
a sleeping state.

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:32.559
You can see a candle.

00:24:32.559 --> 00:24:38.919
Now when the wick is there, you don’t see
this form of the wick.

00:24:38.919 --> 00:24:44.350
Only when it is enlightened you see them in
that form.

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:50.780
Now when you put one thousand like that they
all put together look like a lotus.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:56.600
But when it is not enlightened, you only say
there are one thousand nerves but when these

00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:02.480
nerves are enlightened, you can see the light
which is in different colours.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:15.419
So today we are here to know that, within
us, all these incarnations exist, and the

00:25:15.419 --> 00:25:24.809
force that really brought forth, really manifested
– who lived like human beings, and worked

00:25:24.809 --> 00:25:34.690
like gurus – that force which existed in
this area, which created religion within us.

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:40.460
Religion as we understand, organised religion,
is not the religion.

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:43.770
But the religion means your sustaining power.

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:51.010
You are a human being because there are ten
sustaining powers within you.

00:25:51.010 --> 00:26:00.600
So they came to sustain us and to give us
full idea about these ten powers and to establish

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:04.490
us in our religion as a human being.

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:14.539
So these Gurus, who lived in that area, worked
out the sustain and helped us.

00:26:14.539 --> 00:26:22.950
And this is one of the greatest forces we
have got, which resides within us.

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:27.760
And whatever they have said has a very great
meaning.

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:35.940
Actually we should say the main Gurus are
ten, but there are many other gurus.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:46.280
And these ten Gurus could be described as
Raja Janaka, then Moses, Abraham, and in modern

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:53.620
times you can say Mohammed Sahib and even
up to Shirdi Sainath in Shirdi that force

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:57.120
came in for a short time, and then He disappeared.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:03.860
Nobody knows how He came there, He lived there
and He died.

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:11.370
Also if you know Nanaka, He was also the same
force, the same Primordial Master, who was

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:14.130
born on this Earth.

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:21.490
Now this is not the time to tell about individual
people, but I think one day I will talk to

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:25.029
you only on this subject of the Gurus.

00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:35.429
So these Gurus first started under the Primordial
Master Himself, who was called as Dattatreya.

00:27:35.429 --> 00:27:45.870
And this Dattatreya is the one who is comprising
all these forces: the existence force and

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:51.600
the evolutionary force and the creative force,
all of them, in its innocence.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:58.200
I don’t know if you understand it, but there’s
a story about them, that there are three deities

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.720
which belong to these three forces.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:09.630
The left one is Shiva’s force, then the
right one is Brahmadeva’s force and the

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:12.980
centre one is Vishnu’s force.

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:22.300
So they say that all these three Gods felt
that the wife of Dattatreya was a great, devoted

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.300
woman.

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:28.779
And she, with her powers could curse anyone
she feels like.

00:28:28.779 --> 00:28:37.890
So they wanted to take her test and wanted
to find out how far she was a devoted wife,

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:44.710
so they went to her and they told her that:
“We want some alms."

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:50.720
And in India, it is regarded as a great honour
to be able to give somebody alms who come

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:51.720
to your house.

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:55.900
And three saints, they were dressed up saints,
they came to the door.

00:28:55.900 --> 00:29:01.250
So when they asked for alms, she said, “All
right, I will get you some alms."

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:07.700
They said, “No, we’ll come inside the
house, and you have to become completely naked

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.799
and then give us the alms."

00:29:09.799 --> 00:29:14.980
Because to become naked before a man, you
lose all your powers as a devoted wife, as

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:15.980
a sati.

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.460
She said, “All right, if you say so, I will
do it."

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:20.740
And she started taking out her clothes.

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:26.900
As soon as she touched her clothes they became
small children, absolutely small children,

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:30.440
and she took out her clothes and gave them
the alms.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:36.909
So these three small children put together
make the Dattatreya, is the Guru, is the one

00:29:36.909 --> 00:29:44.809
who is innocent like a child, innocent like
a child, who has no sense of sex.

00:29:44.809 --> 00:29:50.910
So we come to a conclusion a guru who has
interest in women, a guru who has interest

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:56.780
in sex, is not a guru but is anti-guru.

00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:06.279
Dattatreya is the innocence of all these three
powers and this Guru was the one who then

00:30:06.279 --> 00:30:08.919
had a big tradition of gurus.

00:30:08.919 --> 00:30:15.740
In the same tradition we had many gurus in
our country and specially in the area near

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:17.830
Bombay, which is called as Maharastra.

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:23.240
They came as Nath, they were called as Nath.

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:29.950
So the first one was Adi Nath, then Dattatreya,
then Macchindernath, then Gorakhnath, like

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:32.299
that a tradition of these gurus came.

00:30:32.299 --> 00:30:38.510
But all their knowledge was kept as a guarded
secret, it was a gupta vidya, is absolutely

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:42.450
guarded secret, a secret knowledge about Kundalini.

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:47.010
They never talked about it; they never told
about it, because they thought that, “Just

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:53.340
now let us experiment with it fully and then
we will give some idea about it to people."

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:58.490
But as you see everywhere it happens, even
it happens with us here sometimes, that we

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:04.909
get people who do not get Realisation or are
half-baked and they cannot rise much higher.

00:31:04.909 --> 00:31:11.230
Then they get very angry or sometimes they
take this half-baked knowledge and start working

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:16.000
on it and they go absolutely wrong on this
side or that side.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:22.240
All such horrible gurus came up in those days
also, but they were neutralised because I

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:27.390
would say that people were spiritually a very
very sensitive.

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:29.370
Nowadays, the people are not.

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:30.650
They are very naive.

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:32.279
They have no sensitivity.

00:31:32.279 --> 00:31:36.860
You see from the face you can make out that
a person is such and such, but they have no

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:37.860
sensitivity left.

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:40.669
You see they are so much used to masks.

00:31:40.669 --> 00:31:48.400
I asked, “Today why people cannot understand
and why do they always have a mask on the

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.400
faces?

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.470
Nothing is beaming out of them, what is it?”

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:56.510
So one told me a very interesting answer:
was that because they listen to news and they

00:31:56.510 --> 00:32:01.050
see that the newsman is reading it and he
gets lot of light on his face, so he has to

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:05.919
keep detached from the news, he cannot show
his any impressions or anything.

00:32:05.919 --> 00:32:10.340
He has to be absolutely detached when he is
describing some news.

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:14.370
So his face is just like a mask and that is
why it happens.

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:20.720
Whatever it is, we have become really naive
as far as spirituality is concerned, and the

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:28.380
people take advantage of it: a full advantage
of this naive behavior or naive nature of

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:29.420
others.

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:35.190
For this you don’t have to go to books,
you don’t have to go to any guru for this.

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:40.450
It’s only a thing of the society in which
you live.

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:46.870
Natural societies have much more sensitivity
to spirituality than artificially sort of

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:53.049
brainwashed, you can call them, or brought
up in a materialistic atmosphere.

00:32:53.049 --> 00:32:59.900
They lose their sensitivity to spirituality
which is spontaneous, which is spontaneous;

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:09.730
because we lose our spontaneity, we lose that
natural – we call it as ‘Sahaja’, means

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:18.880
‘the spontaneous knowledge’ – to know
who is a real person and who is unreal.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:32.570
So this force started manifesting itself gradually
in the caves, in the very secret caves where

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:35.960
only one or two were asked to go there.

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.770
And first they were tested very badly.

00:33:38.770 --> 00:33:41.789
I mean the way they were tested some would
run away!

00:33:41.789 --> 00:33:46.409
So for years together they would not get even
one disciple who was capable of coming into

00:33:46.409 --> 00:33:49.289
this training.

00:33:49.289 --> 00:33:55.280
And at long last if they got one, they would
work on him and then he may die without the

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:56.280
experience.

00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:03.250
Then again he would be reborn, again he would
die, like that it would go on for ages until

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:16.339
then they found that the truth is within you,
till they completely cleansed themselves and

00:34:16.339 --> 00:34:22.389
they became one with the Higher Being within
themselves.

00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:30.879
But this was achieved so little that you will
be amazed that Zen system of religion is exactly

00:34:30.879 --> 00:34:35.980
the same system, is avadhuta, which we call
the Nath style, the same style is.

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:42.649
And they say there have been only sixty-five
Kashyapas, they call them, Kashyapas.

00:34:42.649 --> 00:34:44.960
Sixty-five, just imagine!

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.359
Sixty-five in six centuries!

00:34:47.359 --> 00:34:55.809
So I think it would be one point something
one every century!

00:34:55.809 --> 00:34:58.940
So these were the only people who got Realisation.

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:05.079
And it was a very difficult procedure because
they would raise this Kundalini up to a point

00:35:05.079 --> 00:35:06.079
and it would drop out.

00:35:06.079 --> 00:35:10.944
Then they would raise it and cleanse it and
then again cleanse it and again push it forward.

00:35:10.944 --> 00:35:17.549
It would be something like pushing a car which
doesn’t start: you push it, it comes back,

00:35:17.549 --> 00:35:19.299
again it goes forward, it’s cut.

00:35:19.299 --> 00:35:22.630
Then again you cleanse it and take it to the
garage, you see it’s no good.

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:28.420
Then you take it again back, wash it, clean
it, again get under it and try to cleanse

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:30.630
it again, the machinery, again it goes out.

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:35.650
Like that it goes on and on and you get so
fed up that you think, “Better let it go

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:39.670
back to the factory to be completely renewed."

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:50.289
Then they made it again, put it back and like
that it moved, the movement of this evolution,

00:35:50.289 --> 00:35:52.780
very, very gradually.

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:58.309
And in this gradual movement they had…because
if you move gradually you see many things.

00:35:58.309 --> 00:36:03.589
For example, if you are now going on a bullock
cart – you don’t have any bullock carts,

00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:05.380
we still have bullock carts.

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:09.729
If you have to go to villages, you have to
go by bullock carts.

00:36:09.729 --> 00:36:18.009
And the speed of a bullock cart is maybe two
miles per hour or maybe even sometimes less,

00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:20.270
it depends on the whims of the bullocks, you
see.

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:25.849
If they sit down in between, you can get down,
cook your food and have your food very nicely,

00:36:25.849 --> 00:36:29.680
then again get back into the bullock cart
and then again start moving.

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:32.440
It could be a very, very slow movement.

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:39.309
And then when you stop, you get so bored of
that stay that you get out of bullock cart,

00:36:39.309 --> 00:36:40.980
you go around and see things.

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:45.730
And that’s how they started seeing things
around and they described them, and poor things

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:51.109
got sometimes so upset with it that they used
to get into tantrums and their tantrums also

00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:52.979
are nowadays called as ‘Raja Yoga’.

00:36:52.979 --> 00:36:58.279
I was so surprised that these tantrums were
there because of frustration and because of

00:36:58.279 --> 00:36:59.900
timing.

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:07.190
But now, today, the condition is different
because the blossom time has come I say.

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:14.529
The time has come that evolution has to be
en-masse, has to be en-masse.

00:37:14.529 --> 00:37:19.799
Actually this en-masse evolution has started
much earlier as I said, from the sixth century

00:37:19.799 --> 00:37:22.469
when Adi Shankaracharya started writing about
it.

00:37:22.469 --> 00:37:28.059
He was the one who proclaimed it, who said
that this is the force we have got, we have

00:37:28.059 --> 00:37:29.119
to work it out.

00:37:29.119 --> 00:37:32.420
Now people talk of Adi Shankaracharya and
not a word about Kundalini.

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:35.119
What do you say to such a knowledge?

00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:48.380
You see this is the basis, the basis of Shankaracharya
is Kundalini, and the stai bhav is the emotion

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:55.519
that substantiates it – is the complete
dedication to the guru.

00:37:55.519 --> 00:38:04.740
But the guru is has to be a real guru not
the way moneymaker or what you call this womaniser

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:11.450
and all sorts of things, abuses, which are
absolutely never conceivable to a guru.

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:15.910
He remains absolutely away from these things.

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:20.039
All such things are I would say these are
meant for criminals.

00:38:20.039 --> 00:38:23.519
Or you can say, I have no words, but you can
say horrid people.

00:38:23.519 --> 00:38:33.819
It’s not meant for gurus, who are the choicest
flowers, who are the best people that God

00:38:33.819 --> 00:38:38.410
has created; who are the highest people above
all these things.

00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:44.969
They do not organise, they do not do anything,
they just sit and watch and they just impart

00:38:44.969 --> 00:38:49.029
you the power by which you become one with
God.

00:38:49.029 --> 00:38:50.509
That’s all their job is.

00:38:50.509 --> 00:38:58.650
They are not busy buying aeroplanes and Cadillacs
and some had some, I was told, Rolls Royces.

00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:00.880
They are not busy with.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:08.640
These gurus first took to sanyasa because
it was a very intensive work needed, very

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:09.890
intensive work.

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:15.829
In the early times they took absolute solitude
as their home and they didn’t have children,

00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:17.670
they didn’t have wives, nothing.

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:20.349
They would just dedicate themselves to the
search.

00:39:20.349 --> 00:39:26.310
This is very early I am telling you, say twelve
thousand years back but about eight thousand

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:31.519
years and at the time of Rama, all the gurus
practically were married.

00:39:31.519 --> 00:39:32.740
Most of the gurus were married.

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:38.940
Imagine eight thousand years back, in modern
understanding people cannot even conceive

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:41.009
of a priest who is married.

00:39:41.009 --> 00:39:44.380
They found out without the marriage the balance
is not established.

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:52.289
You must lead a very sensible married life,
and they got married, and they had children

00:39:52.289 --> 00:40:00.279
and wife and they lived in the forest looking
after the small children from the family.

00:40:00.279 --> 00:40:06.849
And when the children came down there even
the grandparents came with them because according

00:40:06.849 --> 00:40:13.369
to the four ashramas we have got, the grandparents
are after fifty years of age have to go to

00:40:13.369 --> 00:40:16.869
the forest to live with the grandchildren
near the ashram.

00:40:16.869 --> 00:40:22.339
And they have to look after the children and
forget about married life.

00:40:22.339 --> 00:40:24.359
They have to finish it at that time.

00:40:24.359 --> 00:40:29.780
At fifty a grandfather is really promoted
and he looks after the children.

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:35.910
He is not bothered about his married life
so much as the husband and wife reach their

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:41.960
culmination of the beauty of their married
life and understanding from twenty-five to

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:43.800
fifty years of age.

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:50.359
So we have a division that till twenty-five
years is the education system then the twenty-five

00:40:50.359 --> 00:40:57.599
years of life is the married life and twenty-five
years of life is this life where, vanaprastra

00:40:57.599 --> 00:41:02.930
ashram they called it, where they had to live
like grand parents with their grandchildren,

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:08.910
give them love and they looked after and also
if they were not realised or they wanted realisation,

00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:11.390
they worked for it.

00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:17.019
So in this system it was perfectly all right
because afterwards the husband and wife died

00:41:17.019 --> 00:41:22.539
after that age so they took to sanyasa, means
they just detached themselves and rose high.

00:41:22.539 --> 00:41:28.369
So the pattern of life was such that you had
to achieve God in your lifetime, you have

00:41:28.369 --> 00:41:33.130
to work for it and all of them aspired for
it and they worked for it.

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:36.170
The whole life pattern was built up to that.

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:41.729
Of course very few people got realisation
but they led a very righteous life so that

00:41:41.729 --> 00:41:46.609
they maintained it for the next life and again
they were born next time, they tried it from

00:41:46.609 --> 00:41:49.970
where they had lost, again they went up and
up like that.

00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:54.690
That was the system of that society which
is, of course is, now very much westernised

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:59.549
and they think you people are much more successful
in life so they are running after you and

00:41:59.549 --> 00:42:01.079
try to become like you.

00:42:01.079 --> 00:42:04.079
But this is what it was.

00:42:04.079 --> 00:42:09.259
But we can see today that is not the situation,
we are in a very different situation.

00:42:09.259 --> 00:42:12.819
It’s a Ghor Kali Yuga they call it, where
righteousness has no place.

00:42:12.819 --> 00:42:15.650
If you talk of righteousness people will run
away.

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:20.749
Like today, you see, they wanted to put up
an advertisement for some university, and

00:42:20.749 --> 00:42:24.999
the lady who was being there, she was telling,
“No, no, no don’t put Self-realisation."

00:42:24.999 --> 00:42:26.869
Then I said, “What should I put?”

00:42:26.869 --> 00:42:30.499
She said, “Put something like enjoying,
you see."

00:42:30.499 --> 00:42:31.940
“All right, enjoying.

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:33.380
Then what else?”

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:37.699
“You don’t talk of God, no, of righteousness,
no."

00:42:37.699 --> 00:42:42.200
Then should I say now I thought that you can
enjoy and come to a discotheque or something

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.200
like that?

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:47.180
Is that the way we are going to attract them?

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:49.180
And then every other person got fed up.

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:51.940
They said, “Mother, we are not going to
fall at their feet.

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:59.420
We need really sensible people, people who
understand their value, who want to achieve

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:03.959
something higher; they may be few but we cannot
manage with this frivolous people.

00:43:03.959 --> 00:43:06.700
We cannot do anything about these frivolous
people.

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:08.380
Let them have one or two shocks in life.

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:09.799
Then they’ll come to us."

00:43:09.799 --> 00:43:13.959
But you see, for a mother it is rather difficult
to think that “Let them have a shock.

00:43:13.959 --> 00:43:17.349
Let them put their hands in the electricity
so that they get a shock and next time they

00:43:17.349 --> 00:43:18.349
won’t do it."

00:43:18.349 --> 00:43:22.180
You see, for a mother it is rather difficult
to accept such a situation.

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:25.809
But it is so, because we had another gentleman
who was a hippy.

00:43:25.809 --> 00:43:29.039
He came to me and I tried to give him realisation
this.

00:43:29.039 --> 00:43:32.999
Again he went back and he started his drugs
and he went into that.

00:43:32.999 --> 00:43:34.259
Again very seriously he did it.

00:43:34.259 --> 00:43:39.380
He did it very well that doctors declared
that he is going to die within twenty-four

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:41.359
hours, you see he did the whole job very well.

00:43:41.359 --> 00:43:46.569
He had all the drugs within him, you could
open a chemist shop, you see, the way he was,

00:43:46.569 --> 00:43:49.349
and mounds of things he had in him.

00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:50.549
And then he came to me with a cirrhosis liver.

00:43:50.549 --> 00:43:52.460
Liver of, you see, liver which was having
cirrhosis.

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:57.089
Thank God, my husband was not at home, so
I said, “All right, get in,” and he was

00:43:57.089 --> 00:43:59.329
there still when my husband came next day.

00:43:59.329 --> 00:44:03.690
He found him in an absolutely horrible condition.

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:10.740
He said, “Now, if You have anything to do
with this young gentleman, if he dies here,

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:14.289
the police will really arrest You, and You
will be in for murder.

00:44:14.289 --> 00:44:16.640
Now You please don’t go in for that."

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:20.910
But we treated him and, you’ll be amazed,
within eight days he was perfectly all right

00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:22.950
and he’s such a great sahaja yogi today.

00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:25.309
Now he’s in Australia; I always remember
him.

00:44:25.309 --> 00:44:30.469
And you know, he was a professor of physics
and he was a very learned man, but he did

00:44:30.469 --> 00:44:39.479
all this tomfoolery just to go to hell directly
with a running jump, you see, and it was very

00:44:39.479 --> 00:44:41.819
difficult in the beginning to convince him.

00:44:41.819 --> 00:44:46.339
But later on, you see, what he told me was
most shocking because he told Me, “Mother,

00:44:46.339 --> 00:44:50.019
most of us have to be that way, otherwise
we’ll not come to You."

00:44:50.019 --> 00:44:55.859
Now this is too much for me to understand
that, that it should be so hard on anyone

00:44:55.859 --> 00:44:56.980
who are seeking.

00:44:56.980 --> 00:45:04.349
Now you will be amazed that the seekers who
were there at that time are today born more

00:45:04.349 --> 00:45:07.859
in the West than in the East.

00:45:07.859 --> 00:45:09.339
You are real seekers.

00:45:09.339 --> 00:45:14.709
Perhaps you have never evaluated yourself,
and you have lost that sensitivity to seeking.

00:45:14.709 --> 00:45:19.759
That is one thing true because the way you
have been guru-shopping, one can understand

00:45:19.759 --> 00:45:25.400
that how could it be possible that you have
been going from here to there not understanding

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:26.400
this.

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:31.660
But, you see, because you were seeking, I
would say, because you were seeking, you jumped

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:38.480
onto someone, you jumped onto another one,
jumped onto third one, just to get the, what

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:45.369
you call, the feeling that you were seeking.

00:45:45.369 --> 00:45:55.309
And this jumping from one to another has really
been very, very wrong because by that you

00:45:55.309 --> 00:45:57.940
have definitely disturbed your Kundalini.

00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:05.539
The most dangerous thing about these people
is that they disturbed the path of your Kundalini,

00:46:05.539 --> 00:46:09.460
which you will learn; when you will be realised,
you will know.

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:15.920
All these gurus, apart from giving you diseases
like cancer and all that, have been destroying

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.480
your chakras, destroying your Kundalini.

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.839
I have seen big holes in your chakras.

00:46:20.839 --> 00:46:24.059
I have seen burnt portions in the Kundalini.

00:46:24.059 --> 00:46:31.630
I have seen horrible distortions and mutilations
of even the private parts of people because

00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:37.640
you can see on this chakra, this last chakra,
which is dealing with your private parts,

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:44.329
you see, that they have really ruined you
completely, to such an extent that it is I

00:46:44.329 --> 00:46:53.000
feel irreparable, but still, we would try
our level best to work it out and to get it

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.559
done.

00:46:54.559 --> 00:47:02.199
I would only request you to have an attitude
of openness and little relaxed.

00:47:02.199 --> 00:47:07.869
Like somebody has an appointment say about
seven o’clock, so he comes to attend my

00:47:07.869 --> 00:47:09.989
program – six to seven, Mataji’s lecture.

00:47:09.989 --> 00:47:12.299
Seven to eight, third lecture.

00:47:12.299 --> 00:47:14.099
Eight to nine, another lecture.

00:47:14.099 --> 00:47:17.329
Such a person is no good for Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:17.329 --> 00:47:25.220
You have to have patience with yourself and
you have to have patience with Sahaja Yoga

00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:31.249
too because some people from the jungles and
who are not in the open, who do not come to

00:47:31.249 --> 00:47:36.849
London or to America, these people have told
so many sahaja yogis that “We don’t know

00:47:36.849 --> 00:47:38.950
why Mataji is giving you these vibrations.

00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:40.009
What have you done?”

00:47:40.009 --> 00:47:43.729
All sorts of questions and they are quite
jealous and they don’t even understand how

00:47:43.729 --> 00:47:48.759
these sahaja yogis can raise the Kundalini
so easily.

00:47:48.759 --> 00:47:56.910
So one can say that it is happening and it
is there, you all should have it because you

00:47:56.910 --> 00:48:05.069
are the seekers and this blessing was to be
bestowed, is promised even in the Puranas

00:48:05.069 --> 00:48:12.940
it was said that in Kali Yuga those saints
who are seeking God in the hills and dales

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:22.910
will be blessed in Kali Yuga, in this time,
modern times and they will be born as ordinary

00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:27.529
householders and they will get their ultimately
truth, it is a fact.

00:48:27.529 --> 00:48:29.299
You have to see it.

00:48:29.299 --> 00:48:33.329
And no use, I was told some people are coming
here for spying.

00:48:33.329 --> 00:48:35.410
I say, “What are they spying?”

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:37.809
You see, this is for your good.

00:48:37.809 --> 00:48:40.449
What is there to spy in this thing?

00:48:40.449 --> 00:48:42.019
It is all very open.

00:48:42.019 --> 00:48:47.349
This is for your good, for your betterment,
for your own life.

00:48:47.349 --> 00:48:49.839
For whom are you spying?

00:48:49.839 --> 00:48:52.759
What are they going to give you, madness?

00:48:52.759 --> 00:48:56.790
They’ll take away all your money.

00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:59.449
As a mother I must tell you, you have to be
careful.

00:48:59.449 --> 00:49:05.329
They may pay you little money for spying but
what’s the use of loosing your spirit and

00:49:05.329 --> 00:49:09.329
getting that little money, all the false promises.

00:49:09.329 --> 00:49:16.650
Best thing is to get it within yourself, your
own powers and know yourself and know what

00:49:16.650 --> 00:49:23.499
is your self-interest and don’t be just
wasting yourself for all these nonsensical

00:49:23.499 --> 00:49:32.640
things like crusades and, what you call, stories
about it.

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:38.869
People have misused all the knowledge that
was in the Bible, in the Quran, in the Vedas

00:49:38.869 --> 00:49:44.859
for exploiting others, it is something very
sad but human beings are like that, they are

00:49:44.859 --> 00:49:45.859
really like that.

00:49:45.859 --> 00:49:52.249
So we have to be very, very careful and we
have to understand that we have to have our

00:49:52.249 --> 00:49:53.619
own power.

00:49:53.619 --> 00:49:55.519
What is the use if I am very powerful?

00:49:55.519 --> 00:49:56.519
What’s the use?

00:49:56.519 --> 00:50:03.079
If the sun is very powerful, what’s the
use unless and until it does some good to

00:50:03.079 --> 00:50:04.079
us?

00:50:04.079 --> 00:50:10.219
If I have the power, say, to move all this,
what’s the use?

00:50:10.219 --> 00:50:11.219
You must have your powers.

00:50:11.219 --> 00:50:12.219
You must feel your powers.

00:50:12.219 --> 00:50:14.170
You should be able to exercise your powers.

00:50:14.170 --> 00:50:16.579
That is what you must ask.

00:50:16.579 --> 00:50:25.390
This is the main theme of Sahaja Yoga: that
it is your own power which starts manifesting.

00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:27.099
So, thank you very much.

00:50:27.099 --> 00:50:30.630
I hope the lecture was not too great for you.

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:37.670
But today I was just thinking that today I
will tell you about this guru dynasty because

00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:40.700
this is the way the gurus are there by the
dozens.

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:43.900
You must know that what is a real guru.

00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:46.699
And how they came in and what was their job.

00:50:46.699 --> 00:50:52.329
There’s one more point I would like to tell
you that……

00:50:52.329 --> 00:51:04.059
[UNCLEAR] here there are two more small chakras,
one that belongs to, which we call as the

00:51:04.059 --> 00:51:05.059
Surya.

00:51:05.059 --> 00:51:12.259
Surya is the, means the Sun, the Sun centre
and the another as the Moon centre on the

00:51:12.259 --> 00:51:13.319
left-hand side.

00:51:13.319 --> 00:51:25.859
And these two are governed or, we can say,
is bestowed upon by two great people who are

00:51:25.859 --> 00:51:29.069
the disciple elements.

00:51:29.069 --> 00:51:36.119
And disciple elements were first, were born
to Shri Rama and Shri Sita as the Luv and

00:51:36.119 --> 00:51:37.119
Kush.

00:51:37.119 --> 00:51:40.339
And then they incarnated many a times on this
Earth as disciple.

00:51:40.339 --> 00:51:48.769
One of them is, we can say, was Shankaracharya,
another was Kabira, like that.

00:51:48.769 --> 00:51:56.839
Then we can say, later on like, before Shankaracharya,
they came as Buddha and Mahavira.

00:51:56.839 --> 00:52:08.599
Then Shankaracharya and then I told you, after
Shankaracharya came the advent of Hassan and

00:52:08.599 --> 00:52:12.979
Hussain, who were the grandsons of Prophet.

00:52:12.979 --> 00:52:20.509
So these have been incarnating and they have
been moving from one side to another and telling

00:52:20.509 --> 00:52:24.960
people that “This is extreme, leave it,
this is extreme, leave it.

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:27.930
Come in the centre and be in the centre."

00:52:27.930 --> 00:52:33.479
That has been their job and they are the ones
who are sort of imparting you that awareness

00:52:33.479 --> 00:52:35.469
by you become a perfect disciple.

00:52:35.469 --> 00:52:47.660
And this is a very important point because
it comes quite often that we do not understand:

00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:50.930
like Prophet Mohammad said that “I am the
last prophet."

00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:55.160
All right, He did say that He was the last
prophet.

00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:57.559
Supposing I say, I am the last person to come
here.

00:52:57.559 --> 00:53:01.439
All right I would say just to frighten you
that you better take to it otherwise this

00:53:01.439 --> 00:53:06.069
is the last time I am telling you.

00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:11.999
But it is never that because when He died
He found out that, you see, these people are

00:53:11.999 --> 00:53:12.999
mad caps.

00:53:12.999 --> 00:53:15.509
“I didn’t tell them this, what are they
doing out of Me?”

00:53:15.509 --> 00:53:20.030
So he said, “I better go back again,”
and He came as Nanaka and He told them that

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:27.249
“Hindu and Muslims are same people, following
the same religion, why are you fighting among

00:53:27.249 --> 00:53:28.249
yourselves?”

00:53:28.249 --> 00:53:29.249
He came for that unity.

00:53:29.249 --> 00:53:36.030
Then as Nanaka He came; so in Nanaka’s system
also the Sikhism came in and they started

00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:37.890
a warrior class and this and that.

00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:43.210
I mean imagine, the Sikhism ended up by having
wars within Muslims and Hindus.

00:53:43.210 --> 00:53:45.990
So then He came as Shirdi Sai Nath to teach
them.

00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:50.519
Now this is not a very important thing that,
say Mohammad Sahib said, “I am the last."

00:53:50.519 --> 00:53:53.439
Say He is the last, all right, even take that
position.

00:53:53.439 --> 00:53:55.900
Who are you to him?

00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:56.900
How are you related?

00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:57.900
Through what?

00:53:57.900 --> 00:53:59.640
What is your authority?

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:02.140
How do you appropriate Him to yourself?

00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:03.660
Because you say you are Muslims.

00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:04.660
So what?

00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:05.730
How did you become Muslims?

00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:08.630
Did you get your certificate from God?

00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:11.200
Like Christians are, you see.

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:12.859
They say, “We are Christians."

00:54:12.859 --> 00:54:14.049
How are they?

00:54:14.049 --> 00:54:15.229
They are baptised.

00:54:15.229 --> 00:54:16.229
How?

00:54:16.229 --> 00:54:19.299
They go to church, somebody puts the hand.

00:54:19.299 --> 00:54:20.369
Who is he?

00:54:20.369 --> 00:54:22.299
Is he authorised by God?

00:54:22.299 --> 00:54:24.989
Does he really break your fontanel bone?

00:54:24.989 --> 00:54:26.920
Does he really blesses you?

00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:30.219
He is just appropriating God to himself.

00:54:30.219 --> 00:54:32.119
How are they concerned with God?

00:54:32.119 --> 00:54:33.269
I don’t understand.

00:54:33.269 --> 00:54:36.969
They are nowhere near Christ, I can see that
clearly.

00:54:36.969 --> 00:54:39.219
If they were, they would have been doing something
else.

00:54:39.219 --> 00:54:44.420
They would have given realisation to people
and giving them the second birth which Christ

00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:47.469
has told again and again that “You are to
be born again."

00:54:47.469 --> 00:54:52.049
I am talking of the eternal life, and not
this life of organizing churches and making

00:54:52.049 --> 00:54:56.930
profits so much so that the half of London
should belong to a church.

00:54:56.930 --> 00:55:03.029
Same with Hindus, another silly people.

00:55:03.029 --> 00:55:06.589
One would think they did not organise it so
it could not go further.

00:55:06.589 --> 00:55:09.930
Even there is one of the Shankaracharya’s,
he is trying to collect money.

00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:12.599
I said, “For what is he collecting the money,
this fellow?”

00:55:12.599 --> 00:55:13.650
They said, “Oh, no.

00:55:13.650 --> 00:55:18.660
He wants, now he is trying to, you see, sort
of, compete with your Pope."

00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:23.679
So he wants to begin with, he wants to have
an umbrella of gold, embedded with all precious

00:55:23.679 --> 00:55:24.679
stones.

00:55:24.679 --> 00:55:26.099
He’s a tiny little fellow.

00:55:26.099 --> 00:55:32.949
I don’t know how he is going to look with
that big umbrella around him.

00:55:32.949 --> 00:55:36.589
All such people claim.

00:55:36.589 --> 00:55:39.489
It is such a misappropriation.

00:55:39.489 --> 00:55:41.079
What is the authority you have got?

00:55:41.079 --> 00:55:42.739
This is something I can’t understand.

00:55:42.739 --> 00:55:44.779
Everybody goes to theological college.

00:55:44.779 --> 00:55:48.039
How can he learn God in the college?

00:55:48.039 --> 00:55:49.390
What college did Christ go?

00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:54.230
I mean of all the things, when you have Christ
before you why don’t you judge according

00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:55.230
to His standards?

00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:57.609
Which college did Christ go?

00:55:57.609 --> 00:55:59.130
Which theological college?

00:55:59.130 --> 00:56:04.749
If He had, if He was to come here, people
would say that He’s good for nothing.

00:56:04.749 --> 00:56:07.359
They may put Him in the prison again.

00:56:07.359 --> 00:56:13.559
And in America sure, because if you cure anybody
in America you are in the jail.

00:56:13.559 --> 00:56:15.660
That’s what it is.

00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:20.849
So the whole misappropriation has been worked
out.

00:56:20.849 --> 00:56:28.160
By this awareness, the vibratory awareness
you get after realisation, you will know that

00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:33.869
you cannot be misappropriated, by which you
become that.

00:56:33.869 --> 00:56:40.099
Once you become that, then you can feel it,
those vibrations flowing into you, you can

00:56:40.099 --> 00:56:50.519
feel your heart emitting those vibrations
because the Spirit is awakened and you can

00:56:50.519 --> 00:56:56.660
feel that and you get that vibratory awareness
by which, as you see on the hands, you can

00:56:56.660 --> 00:56:58.249
feel your chakras.

00:56:58.249 --> 00:57:03.000
That is Self-realisation: knowing about yourself
and also you know about others.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.259
It can happen just in a second, in a split
of a second.

00:57:06.259 --> 00:57:08.869
With some people it takes time, doesn’t
matter.

00:57:08.869 --> 00:57:11.820
I have patience, you have patience.

00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:14.729
I’m only for this job here and I am going
to be here for years.

00:57:14.729 --> 00:57:21.890
Now I hope so, for some years at least and
we are going to work it out.

00:57:21.890 --> 00:57:23.279
So thank you very much.

00:57:23.279 --> 00:57:28.229
Now if you have to ask any questions, please
ask me for a short time because then we should

00:57:28.229 --> 00:57:30.670
go to the workshop.

00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:38.209
Can I have some water please.

00:57:38.209 --> 00:57:44.489
Shri Mataji: Yes … little louder.

00:57:44.489 --> 00:57:47.009
Question: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:47.009 --> 00:57:57.950
Shri Mataji: The coming incarnation is the
Kalki, as they call it, Kalki is the one which

00:57:57.950 --> 00:58:03.579
means nishkalanka, means the one which is
blemishless, there is no blemish on that person,

00:58:03.579 --> 00:58:05.740
you cannot put a blemish on Him.

00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:09.019
If you try to do it, you will be destroyed.

00:58:09.019 --> 00:58:14.689
But this One is going to come just to do the
last sorting-out.

00:58:14.689 --> 00:58:18.910
You won’t have anybody to persuade you,
to tell you that, “Get your realisation,”

00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:19.910
nothing of the kind.

00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:27.230
You see, He will just come as we have after
the whole harvest is done, then the last cutting

00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:28.230
of it.

00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:32.609
He is just coming for that; He is not going
to talk to you; He is not going to listen

00:58:32.609 --> 00:58:34.339
to you, nothing doing.

00:58:34.339 --> 00:58:41.859
The time from this to that is short, so you
better get yourself in the proper shape and

00:58:41.859 --> 00:58:45.349
don’t ask for His coming just now because
it will be very hasty.

00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:50.670
Just now let all of you be there in the boat
properly settled down, let us go onto the

00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:54.799
other side and then let Him come, because
He’s coming with eleven powers, which is

00:58:54.799 --> 00:58:56.489
known as Ekadasha Rudra.

00:58:56.489 --> 00:59:04.499
They are all placed here in the head of the
primordial being and He will be manifesting

00:59:04.499 --> 00:59:13.339
all these in such a tremendous manner that
you would not know how people will be destroyed,

00:59:13.339 --> 00:59:19.259
and the destruction will be of the worst type
that you have ever seen that’s why try to

00:59:19.259 --> 00:59:25.539
mature; became the fruits and be in the kingdom
of God.

00:59:25.539 --> 00:59:26.880
All right.

00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:28.219
Thank you.

00:59:28.219 --> 00:59:30.229
Yes, my child?

00:59:30.229 --> 00:59:33.589
Question: Who is Your guru?

00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:35.599
Shri Mataji: Nobody.

00:59:35.599 --> 00:59:37.309
I have no guru, I’m a mother.

00:59:37.309 --> 00:59:44.599
I don’t need any guru and I have been like
this since ages now.

00:59:44.599 --> 00:59:46.079
I’m very ancient.

00:59:46.079 --> 00:59:47.079
Question: [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:47.079 --> 00:59:49.529
Shri Mataji: That’s my own.

00:59:49.529 --> 00:59:58.150
I have no guru, neither I ever had, but I
have the guru, I call him as Dattatreya, if

00:59:58.150 --> 01:00:00.160
that is so, but that is also within Me.

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:02.390
In my stomach is the guru.

01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:07.539
You ask this question, “Mother, have You
any guru?”

01:00:07.539 --> 01:00:10.890
Just ask this question in your hand, and you
will know it.

01:00:10.890 --> 01:00:17.009
To know me is not so easy because I’m very
elusive, extremely elusive person you can

01:00:17.009 --> 01:00:18.939
think of, you see.

01:00:18.939 --> 01:00:22.109
So just now you just know yourself.

01:00:22.109 --> 01:00:23.109
All right?

01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:28.390
When you will have that awareness, you will
know Me.

01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:30.109
All right?

01:00:30.109 --> 01:00:31.839
Question: [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:31.839 --> 01:00:37.789
Shri Mataji: Because you don’t have those
eyes to know Me.

01:00:37.789 --> 01:00:39.809
Good question also.

01:00:39.809 --> 01:00:51.709
Who was the guru of Christ?

01:00:51.709 --> 01:00:53.609
Who was?

01:00:53.609 --> 01:00:59.329
His own mother.

01:00:59.329 --> 01:01:05.049
So, no questions?

01:01:05.049 --> 01:01:08.859
Question: [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:08.859 --> 01:01:14.579
Shri Mataji: Correct.

01:01:14.579 --> 01:01:28.119
Absolutely that’s what… very true, yes.

01:01:28.119 --> 01:01:30.450
No.

01:01:30.450 --> 01:01:32.779
Yeah.

01:01:32.779 --> 01:01:39.359
So what is your question in this?

01:01:39.359 --> 01:01:45.309
All right, I will tell you one thing that,
you see, if you go to these temples and places

01:01:45.309 --> 01:01:47.589
where you think that they are misappropriating
or not.

01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:53.960
Now as I have said to you already that the
job of a person who represents God or says

01:01:53.960 --> 01:02:00.380
that he is God or he has the power of God
within himself should do only one thing, is

01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:05.239
that he should be able to connect you with
God, that’s all, the rest of the things

01:02:05.239 --> 01:02:06.619
is absolutely useless.

01:02:06.619 --> 01:02:12.029
If he cannot connect you to God then he is
absolutely useless person.

01:02:12.029 --> 01:02:20.890
For example we get a person who says he is
the Secretary to the Queen, her Majesty the

01:02:20.890 --> 01:02:26.420
Queen, then he should be able to get at least
an appointment for us otherwise how are we

01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:29.099
to believe that they have any authority?

01:02:29.099 --> 01:02:35.459
Now if you say that people believe in things
and that ….[UNCLEAR] now, you see, believing

01:02:35.459 --> 01:02:41.579
into something has led you nowhere, see it
is blindness, on the contrary this kind of

01:02:41.579 --> 01:02:46.049
blindness has led to complete exploitation.

01:02:46.049 --> 01:02:50.859
You have seen in our country or in anywhere,
you are completely exploited.

01:02:50.859 --> 01:02:58.439
You do not realise it how much you are exploited
by these organisations which claim and appropriate

01:02:58.439 --> 01:03:03.589
that God is with them or sort of they are
serving the God.

01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:09.650
The only thing that they should do to find
out the ways and methods of connecting you

01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:10.829
to God.

01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:13.525
If they cannot do it then one should know
that there is something wrong with them.

01:03:13.525 --> 01:03:17.109
They have no authority of any kind.

01:03:17.109 --> 01:03:20.130
Question or comment: [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:23.160
Shri Mataji: Can organise?

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.869
No, not at all.

01:03:24.869 --> 01:03:25.869
They cannot.

01:03:25.869 --> 01:03:28.180
It’s a child’s play going on.

01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:29.259
They cannot.

01:03:29.259 --> 01:03:30.679
How can you.

01:03:30.679 --> 01:03:38.880
See it’s now but how can they You see, you
cannot organise God, you must have authority,

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:43.459
you should be a realised soul, minimum, connected
with God.

01:03:43.459 --> 01:03:48.009
Say, supposing this is not connected, all
right, with the mains.

01:03:48.009 --> 01:03:49.479
What can you organise it?

01:03:49.479 --> 01:03:51.809
You better put it down there, isn’t it?

01:03:51.809 --> 01:03:55.900
Otherwise you cannot use it.

01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:56.900
What else can you do?

01:03:56.900 --> 01:04:01.349
Supposing this is not connected with the mains,
it is not working, that’s all, simple.

01:04:01.349 --> 01:04:06.279
You try everything, you organise, you organise
a committee, bring many people to plan it,

01:04:06.279 --> 01:04:12.680
it won’t work out, unless and until you
connect it.

01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:19.239
So called, so called baptism is useless, but
the real baptism is there, the Kundalini rises,

01:04:19.239 --> 01:04:29.029
you will be surprised this portion becomes
absolutely soft here, just like a child.

01:04:29.029 --> 01:04:34.940
Actualisation is important, if they cannot
actualise it, what are they doing?

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:39.429
This is like, you see, you send an invitation
to people, “Please come and have dinner

01:04:39.429 --> 01:04:43.669
with us and come along and we have organised
a very good dinner and everything,” you

01:04:43.669 --> 01:04:47.319
go there you find a table very nicely laid
down and everything is there, they ask you

01:04:47.319 --> 01:04:52.339
sit on the chair and all that, and then they
will say “Will you eat?” and there’s

01:04:52.339 --> 01:04:54.859
no dinner, nothing, what means?

01:04:54.859 --> 01:04:57.569
They say, “It is very tasty dinner."

01:04:57.569 --> 01:05:00.400
Everybody looks at each other, “Yes, must
be."

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:04.919
You see, the one thinks that “Maybe we are
blind, you know, maybe that we are little

01:05:04.919 --> 01:05:05.919
foolish, we cannot do it."

01:05:05.919 --> 01:05:22.559
You see, so it would be like that, you see.
