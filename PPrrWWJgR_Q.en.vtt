00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.551
First, I‘ll speak in Hindi language

00:03:28.752 --> 00:03:32.412
and then in English language.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.624
Today we have assembled here to worship Shri Maha Deva,

00:03:44.942 --> 00:03:49.032
Shri Shiva Shankar.

00:03:52.292 --> 00:03:55.686
In the name of Shankarji,

00:03:55.887 --> 00:03:59.488
many organizations have come up in this world.

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:05.326
Because of Adi Shankaracharya’s emphasis,

00:04:05.527 --> 00:04:10.584
worshipping ShivJi became very popular among people.

00:04:10.785 --> 00:04:16.357
And in South India, two types of sects came up:

00:04:16.558 --> 00:04:19.750
one which were called Shaivites,

00:04:19.951 --> 00:04:23.301
and the others were called Vaishnavites.

00:04:24.138 --> 00:04:28.797
Now Shaivites are the worshippers of Lord Shiva,

00:04:28.998 --> 00:04:32.832
and the Vaishnavites worship Lord Vishnu.

00:04:33.948 --> 00:04:39.687
In our country we are experts in creating divisions.

00:04:39.858 --> 00:04:43.159
We divide the Deities as well;

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.011
and when we try to integrate them,

00:04:46.178 --> 00:04:49.070
then things become even worse.

00:04:49.271 --> 00:04:53.224
For example, a new thing has come up, called Ayyappa.

00:04:53.425 --> 00:04:56.248
It is a very wrong thing.

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:00.899
And in that it is shown,

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.290
that when Lord Vishnu assumed the form of "Mohini",

00:05:05.491 --> 00:05:08.879
then she got a child from Lord Shiva.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.410
How is it even possible?

00:05:11.611 --> 00:05:15.835
Such wrong ideas are created and widespread in our country,

00:05:16.036 --> 00:05:19.139
and then different beliefs groups are formed based on these ideas.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.472
When Indians find some or other reason to fight,

00:05:22.673 --> 00:05:25.080
they become very happy.

00:05:25.281 --> 00:05:29.004
If they have nothing to fight over,

00:05:29.205 --> 00:05:35.520
then, they create something from their own imaginations.

00:05:36.218 --> 00:05:41.808
Actually these two aspects are connected with each other

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:46.619
as sun is with sun light,

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.749
word with its meaning, moon with the moonlight.

00:05:50.953 --> 00:05:57.586
Meaning that the "Sopan Marga" which is there,

00:05:57.787 --> 00:06:04.843
which we call as Sushumna nadi, which is the central path,

00:06:05.044 --> 00:06:07.529
it is the path of Lord Vishnu.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.296
And through this path we attain the Shiva tattwa.

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:17.209
So the destination is Shiva tattwa, Shri Shiva,

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:22.216
and the path is made by Lord Vishnu.

00:06:22.417 --> 00:06:25.947
To create this path Shri Vishnu and Shri Adishakti

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:27.851
have done a lot of hardwork.

00:06:28.052 --> 00:06:30.231
Lord Shiva had no role in it.

00:06:30.432 --> 00:06:32.310
He sits comfortably in his seat,

00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:36.501
not bothering about who is coming or who is not coming.

00:06:36.702 --> 00:06:39.429
So, to attain this Shiva tattwa,

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.423
we should go through this Vishnu path (Sushumna nadi)

00:06:42.624 --> 00:06:47.792
and for that, we have to first correct the chakras within us.

00:06:47.993 --> 00:06:50.224
When the centers are corrected,

00:06:50.425 --> 00:06:52.969
our Vishnu path opens up.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:58.966
And along with that, we gradually start ascending.

00:06:59.167 --> 00:07:02.286
I have told you about all these centers, many a times.

00:07:02.487 --> 00:07:06.961
But there is a chakra in the heart also, which we call `Left Heart’.

00:07:07.162 --> 00:07:09.197
This is not a heart chakra in essence,

00:07:09.413 --> 00:07:16.131
in a way, heart is the reflection,

00:07:16.332 --> 00:07:20.250
the reflection of Shri Mahadeva.

00:07:20.451 --> 00:07:24.827
The abode of Shiva is above everything,

00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:29.375
beyond the mind, beyond the thoughts.

00:07:29.576 --> 00:07:32.490
To attain this kind of tattwa,

00:07:32.691 --> 00:07:35.872
first and foremost we should pay attention

00:07:36.073 --> 00:07:40.843
and see how pure our heart is.

00:07:42.646 --> 00:07:48.661
Inside our heart, we nurture a lot of dirt.

00:07:48.862 --> 00:07:53.656
For example, we feel jealous of someone.

00:07:54.277 --> 00:08:00.624
feeling jealous like somebody has been evil to you.

00:08:00.825 --> 00:08:04.513
Even if they might have harmed you also, troubled you

00:08:04.714 --> 00:08:08.025
there is no use becoming jeolous of them.

00:08:08.226 --> 00:08:10.264
If your heart is clean

00:08:10.465 --> 00:08:13.161
then the mirror within you,

00:08:13.392 --> 00:08:16.659
in which the God Almighty's reflection is going to fall,

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.456
will remain clear.

00:08:18.657 --> 00:08:22.530
But if you have jealousy within,

00:08:23.785 --> 00:08:25.795
then the mirror will not remain clean

00:08:25.996 --> 00:08:28.594
and the reflection of God will also not be perfect.

00:08:28.795 --> 00:08:31.112
To have enmity towards anyone

00:08:31.313 --> 00:08:38.935
and to have anger or ill feelings in the heart towards anyone,

00:08:39.136 --> 00:08:41.261
is very wrong.

00:08:41.462 --> 00:08:46.322
That is why Christ said that: "Forgive everyone".

00:08:46.523 --> 00:08:48.976
To forgive is extremely important.

00:08:49.177 --> 00:08:55.543
And before and after Christ many saints have said the same thing,

00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:57.445
that forgive everybody.

00:08:57.646 --> 00:09:02.667
The moment you forgive, immediately Lord Shiva,

00:09:03.182 --> 00:09:06.212
takes the situation in His hands.

00:09:06.413 --> 00:09:11.403
The subtlest power of all is that of Shri Mahadev.

00:09:11.604 --> 00:09:17.984
And He, then completely punishes that person,

00:09:18.185 --> 00:09:21.769
totally punishes him.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:25.718
This is the responsibility of Lord Mahadev, not yours.

00:09:25.919 --> 00:09:29.819
Therefore to be jealous of anyone is very bad.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:33.836
But I find that there is lot of jealousy even in Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:34.037 --> 00:09:37.117
Sahaja Yogis are jealous of one another.

00:09:37.318 --> 00:09:40.412
If one person is made trustee, the other one is not,

00:09:40.613 --> 00:09:42.227
then he becomes jealous.

00:09:42.428 --> 00:09:44.904
This trusteeship and all has no meaning,

00:09:45.079 --> 00:09:47.126
you all know it is a myth.

00:09:47.327 --> 00:09:49.719
Your Mother has created all this drama

00:09:49.926 --> 00:09:52.086
and has spread a web of maya.

00:09:52.287 --> 00:09:55.337
Even then the mind of the people gets disturbed;

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.043
One person's mind gets disturbed

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.369
and for the other the heart gets disturbed!

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:03.402
I do not understand what should I do!

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:06.474
Such a big work is happening in so many countries,

00:10:06.673 --> 00:10:10.170
so I can communicate with any one person only, right?

00:10:10.371 --> 00:10:13.398
However, things are getting sorted out slowly,

00:10:13.599 --> 00:10:17.263
but still you will be surprised

00:10:17.464 --> 00:10:20.422
that even now there is lot of discussion

00:10:20.623 --> 00:10:23.875
about who is the leader and who is what?

00:10:24.076 --> 00:10:32.528
Second thing, there is a so-called "blessing" for us, Indians,

00:10:33.321 --> 00:10:37.821
that jealousy arises in money matters.

00:10:38.154 --> 00:10:42.329
Even in Sahaja Yoga there is jealousy on money matters.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.075
Someone has got more money and some less.

00:10:46.276 --> 00:10:48.720
Even while doing Sahaja Yoga work

00:10:48.998 --> 00:10:51.955
people see how much money one gets,

00:10:52.138 --> 00:10:54.103
and who gives how much money?

00:10:54.304 --> 00:10:56.985
If a person's heart gets involved with money

00:10:57.254 --> 00:11:00.522
he becomes useless for Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:00.723 --> 00:11:07.226
Because his heart gets covered with materialism.

00:11:07.427 --> 00:11:12.664
If any kind of materialism has affected you,

00:11:12.865 --> 00:11:15.952
then it is very difficult for you to ascend.

00:11:16.153 --> 00:11:17.799
This is the speciality of our country.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.061
I have not seen it so much in foreign countries.

00:11:20.262 --> 00:11:22.479
But here it is prominent.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.946
I think, in Russia and Eastern Block countries

00:11:26.147 --> 00:11:27.986
there is very little of wealth,

00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:30.192
but they are not bothered at all.

00:11:30.415 --> 00:11:32.287
They don't think about money at all.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:36.298
But their heart is so pure, so very pure.

00:11:36.499 --> 00:11:39.891
And only with the pure heart, devotion (bhakti) is possible.

00:11:40.092 --> 00:11:44.794
We all, before doing prayers, wash our feet and take bath.

00:11:44.995 --> 00:11:47.887
But if we bathe our heart

00:11:48.088 --> 00:11:53.685
and ask God that whatever negativities are there within us,

00:11:53.886 --> 00:11:56.111
to please remove them and purify us,

00:11:56.312 --> 00:11:58.799
then it will be much better.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.569
Third thing, that is within us,

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:05.593
are the six enemies (shadripu).

00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:10.428
Shri Krishna has emphasised that krodha (anger) is the worst thing.

00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:12.520
Everything emanates from anger.

00:12:12.721 --> 00:12:14.711
A person shows anger initially,

00:12:14.912 --> 00:12:16.812
then he gets into delusion.

00:12:17.013 --> 00:12:19.812
Then he thinks: "Why did I say all that, I should not have said it",

00:12:20.013 --> 00:12:21.277
and so on.

00:12:21.478 --> 00:12:24.442
But he goes out of self-control, when he gets angry.

00:12:24.646 --> 00:12:28.254
In the fit of anger he loses control over himself.

00:12:28.455 --> 00:12:30.333
He goes out of self-control

00:12:30.534 --> 00:12:33.742
and he spits out words, which are meaningless.

00:12:33.943 --> 00:12:38.106
The dirt he has been accumulating since long in his heart,

00:12:38.305 --> 00:12:41.812
comes out of his mouth.

00:12:42.612 --> 00:12:44.268
We have to beware of this krodha.

00:12:44.469 --> 00:12:47.751
"Why does this anger come?" - we should pay attention to this,

00:12:47.952 --> 00:12:50.452
that why do we get angry.

00:12:50.653 --> 00:12:52.859
There are some who are angry with a particular person,

00:12:53.087 --> 00:12:55.805
there are some who are angry with the society.

00:12:56.006 --> 00:12:59.295
Like this, people get angry in different ways.

00:12:59.496 --> 00:13:02.581
Why does this anger come to us?

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:06.169
"Why do we get angry?" - we should think that.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:08.365
Many people have told Me that,

00:13:08.566 --> 00:13:13.266
"Mother, if someone speaks against You, we get very angry".

00:13:13.467 --> 00:13:15.116
I feel like laughing at this.

00:13:15.317 --> 00:13:19.776
If anybody talks against Me, then I really feel like laughing.

00:13:19.977 --> 00:13:23.542
Because it doesn't make any sense. What is there to talk against Me?

00:13:23.743 --> 00:13:26.872
I am just sharing my love, even then if they speak against Me,

00:13:27.073 --> 00:13:28.291
then what can be done?

00:13:28.492 --> 00:13:30.794
But some people have a crooked mind,

00:13:30.993 --> 00:13:33.545
so we should only pity them.

00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:37.296
One should think that such people are big fools.

00:13:37.497 --> 00:13:41.731
When a person is full of anger, then our attitude towards him,

00:13:41.932 --> 00:13:46.521
should be very polite.

00:13:46.722 --> 00:13:49.474
This attitude may also cool down his anger.

00:13:49.675 --> 00:13:53.626
In our country there are different kinds of angry people.

00:13:53.827 --> 00:13:55.594
There are institutions for that

00:13:55.795 --> 00:13:58.605
who spread with their anger: "Hit this person, hit that person",

00:13:58.806 --> 00:14:00.845
"Beat up this person, beat up that person".

00:14:01.046 --> 00:14:04.163
And this is also becoming an issue at the social level.

00:14:04.364 --> 00:14:08.222
This is a very terrifying situation.

00:14:08.423 --> 00:14:10.022
To beat and thrash people,

00:14:10.223 --> 00:14:14.897
and for that purpose to form an army

00:14:15.098 --> 00:14:18.009
or prepare some weapons to beat and hurt people

00:14:18.192 --> 00:14:19.810
is very terrifying.

00:14:20.011 --> 00:14:26.849
However, for protection, a person is equipped with these weapons,

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:28.799
it is not a big deal.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.879
However, if he is a devotee of the God Almighty,

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.372
he doesn’t require these weapons.

00:14:34.573 --> 00:14:37.661
This kind of a person is always protected.

00:14:37.862 --> 00:14:43.387
If Shri Mahadev resides within a person,

00:14:43.588 --> 00:14:46.172
who can dare to touch such a person,

00:14:46.402 --> 00:14:48.296
who can destroy him?

00:14:48.497 --> 00:14:51.197
Whatever you do, however you trouble him,

00:14:51.398 --> 00:14:54.206
still that person cannot be destroyed.

00:14:54.407 --> 00:14:57.886
But those who trouble them, will get destroyed themselves.

00:14:58.087 --> 00:15:01.432
When you will trust this completely,

00:15:01.633 --> 00:15:04.531
that whoever is troubling you, will get destroyed,

00:15:04.738 --> 00:15:09.145
then your heart will become totally pure and clean.

00:15:09.346 --> 00:15:12.526
This work can happen only in a pure heart,

00:15:12.727 --> 00:15:16.772
because Shri Shiva exists within us, as reflection,

00:15:16.973 --> 00:15:21.691
and only the mirror which is clean deserves to have His reflection.

00:15:21.892 --> 00:15:24.778
Shiva Ji's anger will happen only once,

00:15:24.979 --> 00:15:27.813
or rather people say that He gets angry only once.

00:15:28.014 --> 00:15:30.858
But I have seen him getting angry many a times,

00:15:31.059 --> 00:15:33.416
because it is His right.

00:15:33.617 --> 00:15:35.865
He has a right to be angry.

00:15:36.066 --> 00:15:39.793
If anyone works against Shri Adi Shakti,

00:15:39.994 --> 00:15:42.073
then Shiv Ji has very long hands.

00:15:42.272 --> 00:15:45.543
Without listening to anyone, He finishes such a person.

00:15:45.744 --> 00:15:49.694
Because he knows that Shri Adi Shakti will not do anything Herself.

00:15:49.895 --> 00:15:53.599
She is not going to punish anyone at all,

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.554
and She will forgive everyone.

00:15:55.755 --> 00:15:57.877
So, His hands are so long,

00:15:58.116 --> 00:15:59.875
then there is no limit,

00:16:00.076 --> 00:16:03.642
and when those hands start lashing, then nobody can stop them.

00:16:03.851 --> 00:16:05.685
Who dares to say anything to Him?

00:16:05.886 --> 00:16:08.082
He has got His own maryadas,

00:16:08.283 --> 00:16:12.258
which you can neither change nor go beyond.

00:16:13.929 --> 00:16:18.736
You should understand that in your individual life,

00:16:18.937 --> 00:16:23.734
in Sahaja Yoga, you have to follow Lord Shiva.

00:16:23.935 --> 00:16:28.349
Because, if you don't follow Him, firstly,

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.996
You will get heart problems.

00:16:42.539 --> 00:16:46.303
First thing, is that you will get heart disease.

00:16:46.504 --> 00:16:48.767
It works out in two ways.

00:16:48.968 --> 00:16:52.632
Firstly with excessive anger the heart catches,

00:16:53.217 --> 00:16:57.443
and secondly, after the anger if a person repents,

00:16:57.644 --> 00:17:01.307
then he gets the disease called "angina".

00:17:01.508 --> 00:17:04.492
This is how both the things are useless.

00:17:04.693 --> 00:17:06.666
But one cannot quit anger, just by saying.

00:17:06.834 --> 00:17:08.659
This is something like alcohol.

00:17:08.873 --> 00:17:10.734
It becomes a habit to get angry.

00:17:10.935 --> 00:17:13.611
He starts relishing it, his face gets puffed up,

00:17:13.812 --> 00:17:17.218
he gets extremly angry and no one can control him.

00:17:17.419 --> 00:17:20.225
So, I thought that if you sit before the mirror

00:17:20.426 --> 00:17:23.449
and get angry on yourself,

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:26.407
rebuke yourself with few angry words

00:17:26.608 --> 00:17:29.645
and by sitting in front of the mirror if you say:

00:17:29.846 --> 00:17:32.403
"There cannot be a greater fool than me",

00:17:32.604 --> 00:17:36.173
then perhaps you may get rid of your anger.

00:17:36.374 --> 00:17:38.033
I am saying: "It might be possible",

00:17:38.234 --> 00:17:41.627
because at times, these problems are so intricate,

00:17:41.828 --> 00:17:44.850
that it is very difficult to solve them.

00:17:45.455 --> 00:17:47.435
Further, it has been observed

00:17:47.636 --> 00:17:54.301
that the more we focus our attention on something

00:17:54.502 --> 00:18:00.839
and the more we react to it...

00:18:01.768 --> 00:18:04.842
Someone says something and we react instantly to it -

00:18:05.043 --> 00:18:08.241
this custom is more in the foreign countries.

00:18:08.442 --> 00:18:10.138
For example there is a carpet -

00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:14.480
immediately they will comment, “I don’t like it!", "I like it!”.

00:18:14.681 --> 00:18:16.892
Who are you to say all this?

00:18:17.093 --> 00:18:21.575
Nowadays it's a fashion to say: "I like it", "I don’t like it".

00:18:21.776 --> 00:18:26.617
As if every person is a renowned master,

00:18:26.818 --> 00:18:29.805
who goes on saying: `I like it’, `I don’t like it’.

00:18:30.006 --> 00:18:31.597
This should not be said.

00:18:31.798 --> 00:18:34.841
Saying this is the indication of your Agnya caught up.

00:18:35.042 --> 00:18:37.001
What do you think of yourself

00:18:37.202 --> 00:18:40.981
that you are saying: "I like it, I don't like it"?

00:18:41.709 --> 00:18:47.051
You do not have a right to like or dislike any of the things.

00:18:47.252 --> 00:18:49.611
Supposing, some poor man gives you with affection,

00:18:49.802 --> 00:18:52.482
some very beautiful flowers,

00:18:52.683 --> 00:18:55.639
and you say: "Sir, I don't like this flowers",

00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:00.885
you are unable to understand the hidden emotions behind this act

00:19:01.086 --> 00:19:04.254
because Shiva tattwa is absent in you.

00:19:04.455 --> 00:19:06.669
Even if it is a very small thing,

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:09.636
which has been given to you by a poor person,

00:19:09.837 --> 00:19:15.664
you don't recognise the feeling attached to the emotion,

00:19:15.865 --> 00:19:18.512
and how lovingly he has brought that for you.

00:19:18.713 --> 00:19:23.172
For that in India the example of Sudama has been shown,

00:19:23.373 --> 00:19:27.961
that how he arrived with roasted rice to meet Shri Krishna

00:19:28.162 --> 00:19:32.074
and how Shri Krishna honoured Him.

00:19:32.275 --> 00:19:35.610
Anything given with the feeling of love

00:19:35.811 --> 00:19:39.427
is like a piece of glass on which when paras (mercury) is applied

00:19:39.628 --> 00:19:42.765
it becomes a shining mirror.

00:19:42.966 --> 00:19:46.590
Similarly, if you have feelings of love for someone,

00:19:46.791 --> 00:19:48.903
a very beautiful and good feeling,

00:19:49.078 --> 00:19:50.702
but you have no money,

00:19:50.903 --> 00:19:54.202
then even if you gift that person a very small thing,

00:19:54.403 --> 00:19:56.552
then that person should think:

00:19:56.753 --> 00:19:58.990
"Aha! What an excellent thing it is".

00:19:59.191 --> 00:20:02.654
This feeling of love

00:20:02.853 --> 00:20:05.082
gives a subtle sight to the person,

00:20:05.283 --> 00:20:07.884
which can be called as artistic,

00:20:08.085 --> 00:20:10.637
artistic qualities emanates from it.

00:20:10.838 --> 00:20:12.452
When art is visible from it,

00:20:12.653 --> 00:20:15.190
you start thinking how artistic that thing is.

00:20:15.391 --> 00:20:19.157
This art is the art of love, is the art of love.

00:20:19.358 --> 00:20:21.906
By this art you can clearly see

00:20:22.107 --> 00:20:25.801
how much love is in that person,

00:20:26.002 --> 00:20:29.348
how affectionate he is, how loving he is,

00:20:29.549 --> 00:20:33.363
what a gentleman he is, what a good person he is.

00:20:33.564 --> 00:20:36.086
When you start seeing these qualities in others,

00:20:36.287 --> 00:20:38.268
then you will look within yourself,

00:20:38.474 --> 00:20:42.210
and will start thinking: "How am I?”

00:20:42.411 --> 00:20:44.450
“Do I have that much love?”,

00:20:44.651 --> 00:20:46.532
“Do I have this gentleman's qualities"?

00:20:46.733 --> 00:20:48.554
"Do I have all this goodness within me,

00:20:48.755 --> 00:20:52.178
or am I rendering lip service only?

00:20:53.451 --> 00:20:56.084
And thus misleading the people".

00:20:56.285 --> 00:20:59.210
Actually we are misleading ourselves only.

00:20:59.411 --> 00:21:02.827
When we are doing wrong things, living a wrong lifestyle,

00:21:03.028 --> 00:21:05.593
when our lives are completely filled

00:21:05.776 --> 00:21:08.005
with wrong conceptions,

00:21:08.206 --> 00:21:10.469
then we cannot make anyone happy

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:13.007
and definitely we cannot be happy as well.

00:21:13.208 --> 00:21:15.241
So from the point of view of “swartha”,

00:21:15.442 --> 00:21:17.571
"swartha" - this word is very beautiful -

00:21:17.772 --> 00:21:19.863
it means "to know thy Self" (swa ka arth).

00:21:20.064 --> 00:21:23.761
"Swa" means the Spirit - you must know the meaning of it.

00:21:23.962 --> 00:21:27.317
To know the meaning of it people worship Shri Shiva.

00:21:27.518 --> 00:21:32.652
But I have seen that the worshipers of Shiva are very hot tempered,

00:21:33.253 --> 00:21:38.265
full of anger, very miserly and what not.

00:21:38.466 --> 00:21:40.858
No one is as generous as Shri Shiva,

00:21:41.059 --> 00:21:43.905
no one is as loving as Shri Shiva.

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.312
He is the source of love;

00:21:46.513 --> 00:21:50.480
the love which is flowing all around is the leela of His Holy feet.

00:21:50.681 --> 00:21:53.533
It is due to Him this work is happening,

00:21:53.734 --> 00:21:57.920
that people are fully immersed in the ocean of love in Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:58.121 --> 00:22:00.332
After coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:00.533 --> 00:22:04.155
when you attain the state,

00:22:04.805 --> 00:22:07.526
the state which should be called as Jiva Atma,

00:22:07.727 --> 00:22:12.073
then your attention,

00:22:12.274 --> 00:22:17.330
your attention gets engrossed in the Lotus Feet of Shiv Ji.

00:22:17.531 --> 00:22:21.347
And as soon as it gets engrossed in Shri Shiva's Lotus Feet,

00:22:21.548 --> 00:22:24.634
what happens within you,

00:22:24.835 --> 00:22:29.934
is that whatever qualities of the five elements are there,

00:22:30.135 --> 00:22:32.741
they also become very subtle.

00:22:33.146 --> 00:22:36.777
I have already told you about the four elements,

00:22:36.978 --> 00:22:40.404
but the fifth one, which is called ‘ether’ in English,

00:22:40.605 --> 00:22:42.005
I didn’t tell you about.

00:22:42.206 --> 00:22:43.789
Here it is called "akash".

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:49.776
Akash tattwa is that, when a seeker attains the subtle state,

00:22:49.977 --> 00:22:53.729
then he attains the subtlety of the ether element.

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:56.633
That ”akash” which drives the ether,

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:59.395
that akash which...

00:23:02.888 --> 00:23:05.485
is self-driven.

00:23:05.686 --> 00:23:10.905
If a person has any problem or any trouble,

00:23:11.128 --> 00:23:16.937
then through this omnipresent akash tattwa,

00:23:17.138 --> 00:23:20.129
which is everywhere,

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:25.748
instantly the effect of your attention reaches where it is required.

00:23:25.949 --> 00:23:29.642
It is an amazing thing, but it happens and it happened also.

00:23:29.843 --> 00:23:33.524
People may call it miracle, but it is not.

00:23:33.725 --> 00:23:37.893
In Sahaja Yoga if your Shiva tatwa is awakened,

00:23:38.094 --> 00:23:40.933
then all the subtle,

00:23:41.134 --> 00:23:48.516
the subtlest of the subtle emotions and state

00:23:48.717 --> 00:23:50.479
get awakened within you.

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:55.105
Therefore it is necessary for us to purify our heart first.

00:23:55.306 --> 00:23:59.972
Previously I have talked to you about three enemies.

00:24:00.173 --> 00:24:04.559
Now, the fourth enemy present within us is "madha".

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.029
"Madha" means ego.

00:24:09.245 --> 00:24:12.072
When this ego affects the women,

00:24:12.273 --> 00:24:15.720
they start walking like men.

00:24:15.921 --> 00:24:18.792
Then they cannot walk like women because of the pride -

00:24:18.993 --> 00:24:21.371
"I am something very special" kind of feeling.

00:24:21.572 --> 00:24:28.227
Supposing a girl either comes from a very rich family,

00:24:28.428 --> 00:24:30.004
or she is very beautiful,

00:24:30.205 --> 00:24:32.927
or very well educated, whatever is the reason,

00:24:33.128 --> 00:24:36.371
if she gets ego by anything,

00:24:36.572 --> 00:24:41.145
then she starts walking like a man.

00:24:41.914 --> 00:24:44.907
And when a man is affected by ego,

00:24:45.121 --> 00:24:47.969
he starts walking like a woman.

00:24:48.179 --> 00:24:50.745
Meaning such a man makes himself up,

00:24:50.946 --> 00:24:55.832
for hours sits before the mirror, combs his hair, does this, that

00:24:56.033 --> 00:24:58.885
does all kinds of feminine actions.

00:24:59.555 --> 00:25:01.437
To dress up is the job of the women.

00:25:01.638 --> 00:25:03.463
While walking also he doesn't walk straight,

00:25:03.664 --> 00:25:05.607
he walks in a peculiar style.

00:25:05.808 --> 00:25:07.132
From behind, if you see him,

00:25:07.333 --> 00:25:11.211
you will feel as if a lady is walking in a male dress.

00:25:12.847 --> 00:25:16.080
So, when a man

00:25:16.263 --> 00:25:21.369
gets intoxicated with this ego (madha),

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:23.872
then he is completely lost in his own world.

00:25:24.073 --> 00:25:28.377
In his ego, he starts swaying like an elephant.

00:25:28.604 --> 00:25:31.039
All his actions become different.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:35.817
Whether they talk or don't talk, the way they sit -

00:25:36.018 --> 00:25:38.772
in every action it is evident

00:25:38.973 --> 00:25:41.566
that they have some kind of ego within them.

00:25:41.767 --> 00:25:45.254
It is difficult to understand the cause of their ego,

00:25:45.455 --> 00:25:47.881
what makes them think that they are special.

00:25:48.082 --> 00:25:51.047
All these things are petty things.

00:25:51.248 --> 00:25:53.220
They have no meaning at all.

00:25:53.421 --> 00:25:56.443
In Sahaja Yoga they have no meaning at all.

00:25:56.644 --> 00:25:58.947
And so that is why

00:25:59.148 --> 00:26:01.575
to believe in these kind of things,

00:26:01.776 --> 00:26:03.795
that "we are something special",

00:26:03.996 --> 00:26:06.375
then you just end up to be worse than ordinary.

00:26:06.576 --> 00:26:09.287
You do not remain extraordinary, you become worse than ordinary.

00:26:09.494 --> 00:26:13.910
It means that it's not wise to have any imagination about yourself,

00:26:14.111 --> 00:26:16.927
that "I am very rich" or "I am something great".

00:26:17.128 --> 00:26:20.230
Now even the poor people suffer from ego.

00:26:20.431 --> 00:26:23.755
Even the dalits have become egoistical, it's beyond understanding.

00:26:23.956 --> 00:26:27.961
People talk as if they are something very great.

00:26:28.162 --> 00:26:30.405
What are you as an individual?

00:26:30.606 --> 00:26:33.699
A devotee of God Almighty.

00:26:34.648 --> 00:26:38.497
You are Sahaja Yogis, who believe in God.

00:26:39.415 --> 00:26:42.852
To think about yourself that you are something great,

00:26:43.053 --> 00:26:45.233
is to go away from the state of joy (anand),

00:26:45.434 --> 00:26:49.286
because the power of Shiva gives the state of joy to the seeker.

00:26:49.487 --> 00:26:53.201
To get absorbed in the state of joy,

00:26:53.402 --> 00:26:55.000
people worship Lord Shiva.

00:26:55.201 --> 00:26:57.938
But I have seen that most of the Shiva bhaktas

00:26:58.139 --> 00:26:59.709
are quite grumpy people -

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:01.586
no one can talk to them.

00:27:01.787 --> 00:27:03.038
What is the use?

00:27:03.239 --> 00:27:05.948
They worship Shri Shiva who is verily Natraj,

00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:09.765
from whom emanate all forms of art,

00:27:09.966 --> 00:27:11.968
who is extremely joyful,

00:27:12.151 --> 00:27:14.625
who is the embodiment of "anand".

00:27:14.826 --> 00:27:18.684
In front of Him, how could these people be called His bhaktas?

00:27:18.885 --> 00:27:21.335
They hang such a big linga around their neck,

00:27:21.536 --> 00:27:23.252
which could give them a heart attack.

00:27:23.453 --> 00:27:24.759
What is the need for that?

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.327
You can yourself become the "linga swarupa".

00:27:27.528 --> 00:27:29.154
Without becoming that,

00:27:29.355 --> 00:27:33.836
they claim: "We are Shiva bhaktas",

00:27:34.037 --> 00:27:36.341
and start fighting after worshipping Shri Shiva.

00:27:36.542 --> 00:27:38.790
And they have different marks.

00:27:38.991 --> 00:27:42.125
Shiva bhaktas will put mark across the forehead,

00:27:42.334 --> 00:27:45.735
and Vishnu bhaktas will put the mark along the forehead.

00:27:45.936 --> 00:27:49.116
Oh! What does this mean?

00:27:49.317 --> 00:27:52.560
Vertical application means that you are ascending - alright!

00:27:52.761 --> 00:27:55.052
You are ascending

00:27:55.253 --> 00:27:58.583
and once you reach that state you should become peaceful.

00:27:58.784 --> 00:28:02.218
The mark should be applied both ways, or not be applied at all.

00:28:02.419 --> 00:28:04.457
It should have some meaning,

00:28:04.658 --> 00:28:07.229
that those who are trying to achieve Shri Shiva,

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:09.647
should go through the central path ("Sopan marg").

00:28:09.848 --> 00:28:11.539
While passing through this path,

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:15.272
you have to leave behind all the negativities.

00:28:16.291 --> 00:28:21.136
Before criticizing others, learn to criticize yourself.

00:28:21.804 --> 00:28:25.617
Say it to yourself: "I am like this, I am like that".

00:28:25.818 --> 00:28:27.522
When you start critisizing yourself,

00:28:27.723 --> 00:28:30.735
then you will see that all the bhoots will run away.

00:28:30.936 --> 00:28:33.637
Because we have gathered all these negativities,

00:28:33.838 --> 00:28:36.894
by our continuous thought process, by our Agnya.

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:38.986
By the excessive use of Agnya,

00:28:39.187 --> 00:28:40.799
we start accumulating negative forces,

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.982
everything transforms into a mental projection

00:28:43.183 --> 00:28:47.055
and such a person becomes troublesome and creates misery.

00:28:47.256 --> 00:28:50.865
And that misery makes him also miserable.

00:28:51.066 --> 00:28:54.076
By giving unhappiness to others, you can never be happy.

00:28:54.277 --> 00:28:56.982
It will have its impact on you even if you are a stone.

00:28:57.183 --> 00:28:59.275
It will have its impact

00:28:59.476 --> 00:29:03.816
and the impact is such that the person becomes unhappy.

00:29:05.729 --> 00:29:08.037
As far as a Mother is concerned,

00:29:08.238 --> 00:29:11.245
She always thinks of your welfare.

00:29:11.944 --> 00:29:13.966
She thinks what makes you happy,

00:29:14.167 --> 00:29:16.107
what gives you contentment,

00:29:16.322 --> 00:29:18.413
what gives you peace of mind.

00:29:18.614 --> 00:29:20.455
what can give you love

00:29:20.656 --> 00:29:24.002
and what makes you become a saintly person in this world.

00:29:24.203 --> 00:29:26.075
This is the method of the Mother,

00:29:26.276 --> 00:29:28.480
but this is not Shri Shiva's method.

00:29:28.681 --> 00:29:31.911
He tolerates upto a certain limit and then deals so severely

00:29:32.121 --> 00:29:36.680
that I get terrified that what is going to happen to that person.

00:29:36.881 --> 00:29:39.430
Where shall he reach? What is he going to do?

00:29:39.631 --> 00:29:41.458
Shri Shiva doesn't think that.

00:29:41.659 --> 00:29:45.055
It is not in His nature to think that:

00:29:45.285 --> 00:29:50.874
"Even if he is very bad and evil, I will forgive him!".

00:29:51.075 --> 00:29:54.808
Yes, if the person is worthy of His forgiveness, then He forgives.

00:29:55.009 --> 00:29:57.937
And those who meditate upon Him and do lot of penance,

00:29:58.138 --> 00:30:00.665
He blesses them with boons.

00:30:00.866 --> 00:30:08.646
But that person who, basically, does not want to correct himself,

00:30:08.847 --> 00:30:10.240
Lord Shiva sets him right.

00:30:10.441 --> 00:30:11.641
It is a fact.

00:30:11.842 --> 00:30:15.135
That’s why we should be scared of Him as He is called ”Bhayankar” (Terrifying).

00:30:15.336 --> 00:30:19.066
When He gets angry then He does not forgive anyone.

00:30:19.267 --> 00:30:24.250
But His worst anger comes during the doomsday,

00:30:24.451 --> 00:30:28.701
what we call: "the night when the whole creation will be finished".

00:30:28.902 --> 00:30:32.517
At that time, He will destroy everything with his anger.

00:30:32.718 --> 00:30:38.941
That time, as I have told you, is the Last Judgement.

00:30:39.142 --> 00:30:43.034
During this time which path you take to, where you go,

00:30:43.235 --> 00:30:44.809
whatever you do,

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:50.606
all these things are completely stored within you.

00:30:51.939 --> 00:30:54.793
Every small detail about you is recorded

00:30:54.994 --> 00:31:00.551
and accordingly you are sent either to Heaven or to Hell.

00:31:00.752 --> 00:31:04.549
It is Lord Shiva who sends people to Hell, not Me.

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:06.746
I have nothing to do with the Hell (Naraka).

00:31:06.947 --> 00:31:08.650
But Lord Shiva has.

00:31:08.851 --> 00:31:11.701
He will pull you by your legs and throw you in the Hell.

00:31:11.902 --> 00:31:16.299
Then you cannot say that "I am the worshipper of the Mother,

00:31:16.509 --> 00:31:22.050
and I am the follower of Mother, then why is this happening to me?".

00:31:22.251 --> 00:31:24.401
I am not instrumental in that.

00:31:24.602 --> 00:31:29.177
Once someone calls Me Mother, then I can not think ill of him.

00:31:29.378 --> 00:31:32.954
But, If I am the maryada for Shri Shiva

00:31:33.155 --> 00:31:35.033
then He is my maryada (limit) too.

00:31:35.234 --> 00:31:39.920
But, in this regard since we both are totally opposite in nature,

00:31:40.121 --> 00:31:43.123
you have to be very careful.

00:31:44.029 --> 00:31:46.897
And the eleven Rudras present in Christ

00:31:47.098 --> 00:31:48.791
are also the manifestation of Shri Shiva.

00:31:48.992 --> 00:31:52.323
The emotions of the Rudras are the form of Lord Shiva,

00:31:52.524 --> 00:31:56.858
that is why, you have to be very careful.

00:31:57.911 --> 00:32:01.217
Regarding this I have to warn you,

00:32:01.418 --> 00:32:05.601
because even in Sahaja Yoga some people come to earn money,

00:32:05.802 --> 00:32:08.549
some talk ill of others, some do wrong things,

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:10.679
some do injustice.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:13.713
Such persons are sieved out of the stream.

00:32:13.914 --> 00:32:17.460
But as soon as they are out, they get into the orbit of Lord Shiva.

00:32:17.661 --> 00:32:20.459
Then I get the news that they have gone bankrupt,

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:24.140
this happened, that happened. I say: "Now don't tell Me this".

00:32:24.341 --> 00:32:26.645
They themselves came out of His protection,

00:32:26.852 --> 00:32:29.467
then who could save them?

00:32:29.668 --> 00:32:35.627
So, you should try to seek your protection in Lord Shiva.

00:32:35.828 --> 00:32:37.757
Of course, you are protected by Mother,

00:32:37.958 --> 00:32:40.139
but you should seek also Lord Shiva's protection.

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:44.538
For that, I told you about the five elements.

00:32:44.739 --> 00:32:49.840
The subtelty of these five elements should be attained by you.

00:32:50.041 --> 00:32:56.778
And to achieve that state you should meditate regularly.

00:32:57.586 --> 00:33:00.456
Those who meditate, look totally different

00:33:00.657 --> 00:33:04.188
and those who do not meditate also look different in another way,

00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:05.997
no doubt about it.

00:33:06.198 --> 00:33:09.340
Now those who meditate but they are not willing to do it,

00:33:09.541 --> 00:33:11.377
whose attention is not there in meditation,

00:33:11.578 --> 00:33:14.826
those who do not have understanding or discretion for meditation,

00:33:15.027 --> 00:33:18.514
and they have a kind of laziness towards it,

00:33:18.715 --> 00:33:22.719
then that meditation is not fruitful,

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.826
one does not get any benefit from it.

00:33:25.027 --> 00:33:27.634
Meditation should be such

00:33:27.809 --> 00:33:32.934
that each and every cell of your body gets filled with joy

00:33:33.135 --> 00:33:35.223
and bliss showers over you.

00:33:35.424 --> 00:33:43.697
Lord Shiva's first and most important blessing

00:33:43.898 --> 00:33:48.337
is that He gives you joy, He fills your being with happiness.

00:33:49.136 --> 00:33:53.017
Even only by chanting His name,

00:33:53.218 --> 00:33:56.467
a person should become joyous.

00:33:56.668 --> 00:34:01.039
But instead people always behave in an opposite way.

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:05.768
I feel surprised that nothing is as expected,

00:34:05.969 --> 00:34:08.726
that the people whom we think to be Shiva bhaktas (devotees),

00:34:08.927 --> 00:34:13.524
how could they be such dry personalities?

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:15.625
Not possible at all.

00:34:15.826 --> 00:34:18.062
There is one more reason for it.

00:34:18.263 --> 00:34:23.585
Those who are always busy working, too busy,

00:34:23.786 --> 00:34:26.086
they become right sided.

00:34:26.287 --> 00:34:28.357
When they become too much right sided,

00:34:28.558 --> 00:34:31.266
they get devoid of Lord Shiva.

00:34:31.467 --> 00:34:33.376
They move away from Lord Shiva;

00:34:33.577 --> 00:34:37.396
and then Shri Shiva shows His power.

00:34:37.597 --> 00:34:40.990
Now you know that Shri Saraswati is the sister of Lord Shiva.

00:34:41.191 --> 00:34:43.189
The worshippers of Shri Saraswati,

00:34:43.390 --> 00:34:48.692
I mean the people who read and write, who gather knowledge,

00:34:48.936 --> 00:34:55.140
and apart from that, who are interested in art,

00:34:55.341 --> 00:34:57.235
who are genuine art lovers,

00:34:57.436 --> 00:35:02.021
this kind of people who worship Shri Saraswati, pay homage to Her,

00:35:02.222 --> 00:35:06.635
they should know first of all that She is Shri Shiva's sister

00:35:06.836 --> 00:35:10.547
and you know that sister's relationship is very powerful.

00:35:10.748 --> 00:35:15.417
If you try to deceit His sister,

00:35:15.618 --> 00:35:19.508
adopt any bad qualities or talk ill of Her -

00:35:19.709 --> 00:35:23.000
for example, many people write impure literature or bad books,

00:35:23.202 --> 00:35:27.412
many people have knowledge, but they distort it -

00:35:27.613 --> 00:35:31.773
this kind of people cannot escape the wrath of Shri Shiva.

00:35:31.974 --> 00:35:35.513
Because His sister is very important.

00:35:35.714 --> 00:35:39.765
And to deceive Her is the greatest sin.

00:35:39.966 --> 00:35:42.522
In His view, it is a very big sin.

00:35:42.723 --> 00:35:49.259
And regarding Shri Adi Shakti His protocols are equally rigid,

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:51.196
there is no doubt about that.

00:35:51.397 --> 00:35:55.641
Please check this mike. It is falling off.

00:35:56.492 --> 00:35:59.935
And now, Sahaja Yogis,

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:04.227
first of all have to pay attention towards themselves.

00:36:04.428 --> 00:36:07.295
I do not mean that they should sit before the mirror for hours.

00:36:07.496 --> 00:36:08.688
Not at all.

00:36:08.889 --> 00:36:12.646
Sitting before the mirror all the time, is also considered a disease.

00:36:12.847 --> 00:36:17.052
I mean to say that you should have attention towards your Self,

00:36:17.253 --> 00:36:22.822
look at yourself and see: "What are the problems within me"?

00:36:23.023 --> 00:36:25.956
“What wrong things am I doing?”.

00:36:26.157 --> 00:36:29.103
In our Indian culture,

00:36:29.304 --> 00:36:33.215
the straight path, which has been suggested, should be taken.

00:36:33.416 --> 00:36:35.642
In this time a new era has come,

00:36:35.843 --> 00:36:40.325
in which people think they can live as they want, but it is not so.

00:36:40.526 --> 00:36:42.402
Being in India,

00:36:42.603 --> 00:36:46.630
you have to be in total harmony with the Indian culture.

00:36:46.831 --> 00:36:51.930
Your life style should remain connected to lndian culture,

00:36:52.131 --> 00:36:56.515
because in our culture, Shiva tattwa is given great importance.

00:36:56.716 --> 00:36:59.235
Most important of all is Shiva tattwa.

00:36:59.436 --> 00:37:03.753
And Shiva tattwa only has created our "maryadas".

00:37:03.954 --> 00:37:08.530
The moment you cross these maryadas, you are finished.

00:37:08.731 --> 00:37:11.784
All these maryadas which are in our culture

00:37:11.985 --> 00:37:14.968
are because of the grace of Lord Shiva.

00:37:15.169 --> 00:37:20.563
Whatever has been told to us so far: "Don't do this, don't do that",

00:37:20.764 --> 00:37:22.707
everything big and small,

00:37:22.908 --> 00:37:25.767
these maryadas (boundaries) have been laid by Lord Shiva.

00:37:25.968 --> 00:37:29.966
He is so much concerned about His maryadas

00:37:30.167 --> 00:37:34.474
that the moment you step over these boundaries,

00:37:34.675 --> 00:37:37.606
you get affected.

00:37:38.075 --> 00:37:39.737
Now, in the name of Shiva tattwa,

00:37:39.938 --> 00:37:43.195
people have created so many wrong ideas.

00:37:43.396 --> 00:37:46.750
Like many people think that taking "bhaang" (an intoxicating drink)

00:37:46.951 --> 00:37:49.351
can awaken Shiva tattwa.

00:37:49.525 --> 00:37:52.343
Many others who consume liquor think

00:37:52.544 --> 00:37:55.665
that drinking alcohol submerges you in Shiva tattwa!

00:37:55.866 --> 00:37:59.675
Many wrong ideas of this type have been created by people,

00:37:59.876 --> 00:38:02.611
that this kind of acts are all right for Shri Shiva,

00:38:02.812 --> 00:38:05.227
because He has done that.

00:38:05.428 --> 00:38:08.330
Shri Shiva drank poison also.

00:38:08.531 --> 00:38:10.885
Would you also drink poison?

00:38:11.086 --> 00:38:17.060
He drank poison to make the whole world free from it.

00:38:17.261 --> 00:38:20.967
That is why He used to eat "dhatura" (jimsonweed),

00:38:21.168 --> 00:38:24.070
because "dhatura" contains poison.

00:38:24.463 --> 00:38:27.122
Similarly you might have heard

00:38:27.323 --> 00:38:31.911
that Sai Nath used plenty of tobacco.

00:38:32.112 --> 00:38:36.021
He used to fill it in a pipe and inhale the smoke.

00:38:36.222 --> 00:38:40.526
The reason was that most people in Maharashtra are tobacco addicts.

00:38:40.727 --> 00:38:42.669
A minister also will consume tobacco

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:45.208
and his servant will also consume it.

00:38:45.409 --> 00:38:50.515
And the minister will ask a servant: "Give me tobacco if you have".

00:38:50.716 --> 00:38:55.269
To this great extent there people are used to tobacco

00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:58.422
although tobacco is not grown here, in Maharashtra.

00:38:58.623 --> 00:39:01.798
But somehow they are crazy for tobacco.

00:39:01.999 --> 00:39:04.708
To such great extent people consume tobacco in Maharashtra.

00:39:04.909 --> 00:39:08.965
To free people of this addiction Sainath thought:

00:39:09.166 --> 00:39:12.603
"Why don't I consume all the tobacco?".

00:39:12.804 --> 00:39:15.911
That is why He used to inhale tobacco.

00:39:16.112 --> 00:39:19.725
But people started saying: "Sainath is smoking, so we also can do".

00:39:19.895 --> 00:39:24.276
Because of these kind of people, He used to consume tobacco

00:39:24.483 --> 00:39:29.200
so that the tobacco addiction of these people will come to an end.

00:39:29.401 --> 00:39:33.603
Now, whatever you call it, tobacco is tobacco,

00:39:33.804 --> 00:39:37.632
and there is no connection between Lord Shiva and tobacco

00:39:37.833 --> 00:39:45.243
but definitely He wanted to destroy it from the whole world.

00:39:45.444 --> 00:39:47.776
Now supposing we take the example of Goddess

00:39:47.977 --> 00:39:52.510
and the job of the Goddess is to eat all the bhoots,

00:39:52.711 --> 00:39:55.302
so would you also eat bhoots?

00:39:55.907 --> 00:39:58.073
Also the job of the Goddess is

00:39:58.274 --> 00:40:05.670
to absorb whatever diseases you have.

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:09.467
So, would you dare to do that?

00:40:09.668 --> 00:40:12.160
This is not your job.

00:40:12.361 --> 00:40:16.782
Similarly, whatever the saints and sages have done,

00:40:16.983 --> 00:40:20.556
you neither have the power to do it right now,

00:40:20.747 --> 00:40:22.616
nor it is your job.

00:40:22.817 --> 00:40:25.711
Your job is to cleanse yourself,

00:40:25.912 --> 00:40:29.897
to correct yourself and first attain that state.

00:40:30.098 --> 00:40:32.172
Then all the other matters will be alright.

00:40:32.373 --> 00:40:36.022
But if you don't reach that state, it is useless.

00:40:36.223 --> 00:40:39.734
For you, doing all these rituals is a waste.

00:40:39.935 --> 00:40:41.707
There are many things,

00:40:41.908 --> 00:40:48.191
which can be justified wrongly.

00:40:48.588 --> 00:40:52.888
But if we have to go in the right direction, walk on the right path,

00:40:53.089 --> 00:40:57.006
then first of all we have to purify our hearts.

00:40:57.207 --> 00:41:00.158
All these habits that we are addicted to,

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:03.908
these habits also altogether

00:41:04.972 --> 00:41:07.376
affect our heart.

00:41:07.577 --> 00:41:10.288
So in the olden times, it so happened,

00:41:10.489 --> 00:41:15.902
that all the disciples who came, were made to sleep in jungles.

00:41:24.443 --> 00:41:28.720
They used to live in jungles among the snakes, scorpions

00:41:28.921 --> 00:41:32.359
spiders and all other animals,

00:41:33.436 --> 00:41:37.554
so that they do not get addicted to a luxurious life.

00:41:38.253 --> 00:41:40.739
At the most they could sleep in huts,

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:44.982
which were covered with cow dung.

00:41:45.183 --> 00:41:49.751
They used to live a very simple life and wear minimal clothes,

00:41:49.952 --> 00:41:54.350
so that children do not become crazy about clothes.

00:41:55.436 --> 00:42:00.654
"We want to wear these cloths, those shoes, we want this food" -

00:42:00.855 --> 00:42:03.322
Sahaja Yogis should not say all this.

00:42:03.523 --> 00:42:06.045
You know that your Mother can live anywhere,

00:42:06.246 --> 00:42:08.662
can sleep anywhere, can eat any food.

00:42:08.863 --> 00:42:12.096
So Indians have a craze for taste within -

00:42:12.297 --> 00:42:18.336
all the people here are very fond of eating.

00:42:18.537 --> 00:42:23.053
Sahaja Yogis also invite each other for having food together.

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:27.689
Ladies particularly have to say, wherever I go,

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:29.954
"Mother, come to our house to have some food".

00:42:30.157 --> 00:42:32.534
My food habits are very different.

00:42:32.735 --> 00:42:36.511
I cannot eat in a hotel, I cannot eat anywhere.

00:42:36.712 --> 00:42:41.362
Even in my own house I eat without salt and sugar.

00:42:41.563 --> 00:42:44.808
I am not bothered about taste since childhood.

00:42:45.009 --> 00:42:47.040
I eat whatever is available.

00:42:47.241 --> 00:42:51.690
But Indian tongues are very fond of spicy and tangy tastes.

00:42:51.891 --> 00:42:58.111
Whether they are from from U.P., from Punjab or from South,

00:42:58.312 --> 00:43:03.104
in the matter of eating, Indians are great experts.

00:43:03.305 --> 00:43:07.678
And women befool the men by serving them good food.

00:43:08.959 --> 00:43:14.576
"My husband is fond of this food, my husband is fond of that food"

00:43:14.777 --> 00:43:15.995
What to do?

00:43:16.196 --> 00:43:19.429
Women will be slaves to their husbands and try to please them.

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:22.295
If they keep talking about food day and night,

00:43:22.496 --> 00:43:24.883
then they are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:43:25.578 --> 00:43:29.135
And when I was there in Milan,

00:43:29.336 --> 00:43:32.462
during the program of Guru puja,

00:43:32.663 --> 00:43:34.785
I Myself cooked the food. What to do?

00:43:34.986 --> 00:43:37.432
For four years I Myself cooked there,

00:43:37.633 --> 00:43:40.228
because no one else prepared tasty food.

00:43:40.429 --> 00:43:43.022
People would say: "Mother, it tastes just like plastic".

00:43:43.223 --> 00:43:45.442
In particular, the Indians.

00:43:45.643 --> 00:43:48.894
All the Indians who come there for Puja, have to meet Me,

00:43:49.095 --> 00:43:50.997
as if they have special right over Me.

00:43:51.198 --> 00:43:53.633
Also they are very critical about the food,

00:43:53.834 --> 00:43:55.532
that the food served here is not good.

00:43:55.715 --> 00:43:59.064
Now one more new thing has begun among Indians,

00:43:59.265 --> 00:44:02.336
that they want attached bathrooms.

00:44:03.624 --> 00:44:07.088
Their bathrooms, if you go to their houses and see,

00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:09.070
how their parents lived there...

00:44:09.271 --> 00:44:13.184
Now, they want attached bathroom, that too western style.

00:44:13.385 --> 00:44:17.201
I am mentioning this today, because I am tired of it.

00:44:17.402 --> 00:44:23.015
In Ganapatipule, I provided western bathrooms separately for them.

00:44:23.459 --> 00:44:25.554
At first I provided Indian toilets,

00:44:25.755 --> 00:44:28.870
thinking that Indians will like Indian style.

00:44:29.071 --> 00:44:31.715
And I provided foreign people with western style.

00:44:31.916 --> 00:44:34.597
But then Indians said: "We also need western bathrooms".

00:44:34.798 --> 00:44:36.180
Now what is this?

00:44:36.381 --> 00:44:39.282
I said: "Now a strike is going to start here".

00:44:39.483 --> 00:44:44.256
I said: "Take tumblers and go to jungle, that is what you deserve".

00:44:44.766 --> 00:44:47.453
For years together they have been going like this,

00:44:47.654 --> 00:44:52.768
but now they have become great sahabs and want attached bathrooms.

00:44:52.975 --> 00:44:57.784
Poor western people, poor foreigners who came from abroad said:

00:44:57.985 --> 00:45:01.812
"Mother, we prefer Indian style, because they are very clean.

00:45:02.013 --> 00:45:03.685
So give us Indian bathrooms only".

00:45:03.886 --> 00:45:05.489
Then I changed the arrangement

00:45:05.690 --> 00:45:10.129
and Indians were very happy that they got attached bathrooms.

00:45:10.330 --> 00:45:12.646
You should be ashamed of it.

00:45:12.847 --> 00:45:16.072
Sahaja Yogis should be ashamed talking about such things.

00:45:16.273 --> 00:45:18.452
Your forefathers used to go to jungle with tumblers

00:45:18.653 --> 00:45:20.285
so why do you have this new craze?

00:45:20.486 --> 00:45:23.915
Do you have some disease or any other problem?

00:45:24.116 --> 00:45:25.979
They put Me in great trouble.

00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:28.409
But somehow it struck Me that:

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:32.083
"Okay, you take this and you take that".

00:45:34.494 --> 00:45:37.154
This kind of giving excuses and doing such things,

00:45:37.355 --> 00:45:39.475
is something only Indians do.

00:45:39.676 --> 00:45:43.145
You will be surprised, people who come to Cabella,

00:45:43.346 --> 00:45:45.513
all of them stay with one another,

00:45:45.714 --> 00:45:48.772
though they are very rich people, they have cars and everything,

00:45:48.973 --> 00:45:50.748
still they would sleep in the pendal.

00:45:50.949 --> 00:45:54.577
But Indians will have a special place for themselves,

00:45:54.778 --> 00:45:57.225
they will stay in hotels and roam around in cars.

00:45:57.426 --> 00:45:59.919
They do not have, even to a small extent,

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:03.204
any kind of sacrificing attitude.

00:46:04.493 --> 00:46:06.787
They have not learnt how to sacrifice.

00:46:06.994 --> 00:46:11.681
The way we became so modern nowadays, it's beyond My understanding.

00:46:12.089 --> 00:46:15.739
Now, there are no servants in foreigners' houses.

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:17.597
So, they have no attached bath,

00:46:17.798 --> 00:46:20.819
they have only one bathroom, because they only have to clean it.

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:25.356
You all have servants, so you can afford even ten bathrooms.

00:46:25.806 --> 00:46:31.588
But all these things are taking you away from your own powers.

00:46:31.789 --> 00:46:34.620
Your attention is going in useless things.

00:46:34.821 --> 00:46:37.509
Frittering away of the attention in absurdities,

00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:43.982
all this will make you a very ordinary human being.

00:46:44.821 --> 00:46:48.472
Among women, it is fashion nowadays to go to beauty parlours.

00:46:48.673 --> 00:46:50.409
Their face remains the same.

00:46:50.610 --> 00:46:53.769
They will spend money there, do this here and do that there.

00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:56.736
In Pune, the wife of brahmins

00:46:56.937 --> 00:47:00.700
will wear sleeveless dresses, use goggles

00:47:00.901 --> 00:47:03.507
and roam around in a moped.

00:47:03.708 --> 00:47:05.738
I don't understand it.

00:47:07.044 --> 00:47:09.425
In Pune, which is punya-pattanam (land of good deeds).

00:47:09.626 --> 00:47:12.442
Is this the way to do good deeds?

00:47:12.938 --> 00:47:16.060
We are adopting to western style in such a way,

00:47:16.261 --> 00:47:20.483
without thinking where is Shiva tattwa in this?

00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:23.803
Look at Shri Shiva,

00:47:24.004 --> 00:47:25.938
He sits comfortably with minimal clothes.

00:47:26.139 --> 00:47:29.463
In His marriage procession also He sat upon Nandi and went.

00:47:29.664 --> 00:47:33.425
Why Nandi? Because Nandi is His disciple.

00:47:33.626 --> 00:47:36.252
Whatever He says, Nandi will nod his head.

00:47:36.453 --> 00:47:41.286
He can tell Nandi anything, that's why he is His dearest disciple.

00:47:41.464 --> 00:47:45.950
Now, He sat upon Nandi and arrived at His wedding venue.

00:47:46.607 --> 00:47:48.815
So, Parvati Ji had no objection,

00:47:49.016 --> 00:47:51.321
but Her brother, Shri Vishnu got a little worried:

00:47:51.522 --> 00:47:55.163
"Why is the bridegroom coming in this manner?".

00:47:55.364 --> 00:47:58.997
I do not mean that you become this kind of a groom,

00:47:59.198 --> 00:48:04.273
I don't mean that, but still, to overdo things

00:48:04.474 --> 00:48:09.132
and spending unnecessarily is of no use.

00:48:09.333 --> 00:48:11.208
Be sensible.

00:48:11.409 --> 00:48:14.625
Wisdom is your ornament.

00:48:14.826 --> 00:48:18.279
To accept everything, whatever is there, is alright.

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:19.779
Food - alright.

00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:22.173
Now, if they go to someone's house for food,

00:48:22.374 --> 00:48:24.809
they will keep critisizing the host.

00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:27.195
May not be in front of them but back home they'll say:

00:48:27.396 --> 00:48:28.949
"What kind of food was that?".

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:33.806
If the host cooked good, then they demand same food in their house.

00:48:34.735 --> 00:48:38.296
The whole day attention is on taste of the tongue -

00:48:38.497 --> 00:48:42.373
it is too much in India, beyond the limit.

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:45.063
This kind attention should be reduced.

00:48:45.264 --> 00:48:50.283
The foreign yogis eat Indian food. I've never heard any complaint.

00:48:50.484 --> 00:48:55.064
Although, you can never eat their western food.

00:48:59.821 --> 00:49:04.635
But the way you have coated yourself with these things,

00:49:04.836 --> 00:49:08.241
will not let you get into the deeper joy.

00:49:08.442 --> 00:49:13.703
To achieve the joy of Lord Shiva,

00:49:13.904 --> 00:49:17.068
it is said that you have to renounce everything.

00:49:17.269 --> 00:49:18.870
First renounce the world,

00:49:19.071 --> 00:49:21.688
go to Himalayas and stand on one leg.

00:49:21.889 --> 00:49:24.508
Wear minimal clothes.

00:49:24.709 --> 00:49:29.081
Take a dip in the river and then meditate in wet clothes.

00:49:29.282 --> 00:49:31.436
They used to torture the body in every possible way.

00:49:31.637 --> 00:49:34.246
Even these days gurus beat their disciples.

00:49:34.447 --> 00:49:35.862
They trouble them a lot.

00:49:36.063 --> 00:49:39.275
They don't give Realisation so easily, no way.

00:49:39.476 --> 00:49:42.004
After going through lot of troubles,

00:49:42.205 --> 00:49:45.132
then the disciples get Realization,

00:49:45.333 --> 00:49:50.885
but their Realization establishes in them, strongly.

00:49:51.086 --> 00:49:53.539
Instead, you all have got Realization easily

00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:57.696
but your past things are still lingering in your brain.

00:49:58.913 --> 00:50:00.647
These problems are still with you.

00:50:00.848 --> 00:50:02.470
Now what to do with them?

00:50:02.671 --> 00:50:04.479
They need to be shaken off.

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:06.907
All these things which we have accumulated

00:50:07.108 --> 00:50:09.127
need to be pushed away, totally finished.

00:50:09.328 --> 00:50:11.291
And for that there is no need to make a show,

00:50:11.492 --> 00:50:14.981
renounce the world or leave the home and family.

00:50:15.182 --> 00:50:20.782
Any kind of "Dravidi Pranayama" (breathing technique) is not required.

00:50:20.983 --> 00:50:24.552
But one thing is a must,

00:50:25.428 --> 00:50:28.159
your temptation of the taste should be reduced,

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:31.258
should be reduced gradually.

00:50:31.794 --> 00:50:33.796
You should become oblivious of taste.

00:50:33.997 --> 00:50:35.544
It is very important.

00:50:35.745 --> 00:50:38.639
Oblivion to the taste is a great quality.

00:50:38.867 --> 00:50:42.347
People get enraged if they do not get food of their choice.

00:50:42.548 --> 00:50:48.284
They throw away their plates, beat their servants and what not?

00:50:48.485 --> 00:50:51.735
If you can conquer your tongue,

00:50:53.445 --> 00:50:58.158
then many sweet shops may close down, in My opinion.

00:50:58.359 --> 00:51:02.817
However, I mean to say

00:51:03.002 --> 00:51:06.284
that the body should not be given much importance.

00:51:06.485 --> 00:51:08.299
If the body needs comfort,

00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:11.770
like you want to sleep on a bed and can't sleep on the ground,

00:51:11.971 --> 00:51:14.129
then for ten days sleep on the ground.

00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:15.828
How can you not sleep like that?

00:51:16.029 --> 00:51:19.355
You should not give up until you have enslaved your body.

00:51:19.556 --> 00:51:23.157
Your attention should go away from your comfort.

00:51:23.358 --> 00:51:27.148
There are many people who cannot travel by bus,

00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:31.094
because they can only go by car.

00:51:31.295 --> 00:51:33.695
Then they ask for a car from here, there,

00:51:33.896 --> 00:51:35.604
sit in this car, sit in that car...

00:51:35.805 --> 00:51:37.620
But none of them will think:

00:51:37.821 --> 00:51:41.640
"Come, let me travel by bus today and see what happens?"

00:51:41.841 --> 00:51:44.628
And earlier there were no buses also, so people used to walk.

00:51:44.829 --> 00:51:47.835
When we were in school, we used to walk five miles daily,

00:51:48.036 --> 00:51:51.168
though we had car and everything.

00:51:51.578 --> 00:51:54.569
Such parents we had.

00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:57.684
But we ourselves were very fond of walking barefoot,

00:51:57.885 --> 00:52:01.732
without shoes, carrying slippers in our hand.

00:52:01.933 --> 00:52:05.301
Because of the vibrations it was good to walk on the earth.

00:52:05.502 --> 00:52:10.392
You should also start walking without shoes and slippers sometimes.

00:52:10.593 --> 00:52:12.968
It is very important and very beneficial.

00:52:13.169 --> 00:52:16.726
Mother Earth will get vibrations and you will also feel nice.

00:52:16.927 --> 00:52:22.149
In everything, we have become excessively comfort loving people.

00:52:22.350 --> 00:52:26.372
We have become just like the few Nawabs of earlier days.

00:52:26.573 --> 00:52:29.084
And what did we get? We can get nothing from that.

00:52:29.285 --> 00:52:32.573
We will waste our whole lives by being enslaved to these things.

00:52:32.774 --> 00:52:34.579
We have to reduce this slavery,

00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:39.116
and establish within us the essence (tattwa) of Param Shiva.

00:52:39.317 --> 00:52:43.819
And for that it is essential that everything else becomes unimportant.

00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:47.047
Today wear this, tomorrow wear that,

00:52:47.248 --> 00:52:50.243
and that will match with this dress and so on.

00:52:50.444 --> 00:52:52.783
Whatever is available accept it.

00:52:52.984 --> 00:52:55.684
Whatever comes your way wear that.

00:52:55.885 --> 00:52:57.175
It is not a problem,

00:52:57.374 --> 00:52:59.820
you will not get in any trouble because of that.

00:53:00.021 --> 00:53:03.923
On the contrary you will be happy that you are a contented person:

00:53:04.124 --> 00:53:08.302
"Whatever I got, I accepted with content".

00:53:08.503 --> 00:53:10.760
Nowadays in our Nagpur,

00:53:10.961 --> 00:53:13.429
I don't know if the situation is same here as well,

00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:17.078
the price of the gas cylinder has gone up by Rs. 16.

00:53:17.279 --> 00:53:19.933
Then the photos of protesting women came in the newspaper,

00:53:20.134 --> 00:53:21.917
all well dressed, with heavy make-up.

00:53:22.118 --> 00:53:26.500
I said that their powder itself must be worth Rs. 15.

00:53:30.546 --> 00:53:33.492
These people think: "If others are going for strike,

00:53:33.675 --> 00:53:35.323
then we are also joining".

00:53:35.524 --> 00:53:36.656
What for?

00:53:36.857 --> 00:53:38.518
Because the price increased by Rs. 15.

00:53:38.719 --> 00:53:42.652
Can't you see that your salary has also increased?

00:53:43.334 --> 00:53:48.061
Earlier, supposing, we were paying Rs. 20-25  to our servants,

00:53:48.262 --> 00:53:50.479
today we pay Rs. 2500.

00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:54.494
He also complains, though he gets clothes and other things also.

00:53:54.695 --> 00:53:58.995
Salaries have increased so much, then would the prices not increase?

00:53:59.196 --> 00:54:02.355
Where the salaries increase, prices also go up.

00:54:02.556 --> 00:54:06.408
It is told that in Lanka (tr.n. fom Ramayana)

00:54:06.609 --> 00:54:09.022
there were gold bricks, as currency.

00:54:09.223 --> 00:54:12.441
Now, one person went to get gold bricks.

00:54:12.642 --> 00:54:15.383
He found that, after working for one day

00:54:15.584 --> 00:54:17.283
he recieved two gold bricks.

00:54:17.484 --> 00:54:20.944
After that he went to a barber shop for shave.

00:54:21.145 --> 00:54:24.924
He asked the barber: “What are the charges?” “Two bricks”.

00:54:25.125 --> 00:54:27.429
As the income, so the expenses.

00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:29.228
It is a matter of discretion.

00:54:29.429 --> 00:54:32.218
What is the point in grumbling over the price rise, this and that?

00:54:32.425 --> 00:54:35.052
They all do this even to Me.

00:54:35.253 --> 00:54:37.459
How much has your salary increased?

00:54:37.675 --> 00:54:39.895
Very, very much! Then?

00:54:40.096 --> 00:54:42.390
Then why to keep crying about the inflation?

00:54:42.591 --> 00:54:45.432
When the salary increases, price increase is bound to happen.

00:54:45.633 --> 00:54:48.845
Your salary increases and prices remain the same, how is it possible?

00:54:49.046 --> 00:54:52.369
It's a very simple thing, if we learn this,

00:54:52.570 --> 00:54:56.465
then socially also we could achieve Shiva tattwa.

00:54:56.666 --> 00:55:00.325
Now, Gandhiji was an amazing person.

00:55:00.526 --> 00:55:02.846
I was in his ashram with him.

00:55:03.047 --> 00:55:05.602
I was not bothered at all, but others used to cry.

00:55:05.803 --> 00:55:08.538
Because his principle was,

00:55:08.739 --> 00:55:11.167
that all the people had to clean everbody's bathroom,

00:55:11.368 --> 00:55:13.610
the guests' bathroom and everyone's.

00:55:13.811 --> 00:55:17.320
And there was no sweeper at all.

00:55:17.869 --> 00:55:21.161
Wash your own clothes, wash your own plates.

00:55:21.362 --> 00:55:26.467
And the meal consisted of boiled food with mustard oil on top of it.

00:55:26.833 --> 00:55:30.900
Now, tell Me how many Indians can eat that type of food?

00:55:31.101 --> 00:55:33.997
People used to stay there for 2-3 days and then run away.

00:55:34.198 --> 00:55:35.510
This was the situation.

00:55:35.711 --> 00:55:39.085
Now, you people also should learn to less bother about the taste.

00:55:39.286 --> 00:55:41.642
Now, as far as oblivion to taste is concerned,

00:55:41.843 --> 00:55:44.092
I don't know how I can do it,

00:55:44.293 --> 00:55:49.950
but you can try to eat only boiled food for a few days.

00:55:58.103 --> 00:56:00.672
No mother would say such a thing to her children.

00:56:00.873 --> 00:56:03.790
But what can I do? It is damaging your Shiva tattwa.

00:56:03.991 --> 00:56:06.239
If all of your attention is on eating and drinking,

00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:08.200
then your Shiva tattwa will disappear

00:56:08.401 --> 00:56:10.722
and all the efforts will go to waste.

00:56:10.923 --> 00:56:15.741
So, to get involved too much in eating, is not good.

00:56:16.679 --> 00:56:19.863
In olden days, people used to fast for a day or two.

00:56:20.064 --> 00:56:25.190
Something or the other they used to sacrifice from their side.

00:56:25.668 --> 00:56:28.232
But nowadays it is very difficult to say,

00:56:28.433 --> 00:56:32.249
that if you become contented, become satisfied,

00:56:32.450 --> 00:56:35.881
then it is not necessary for you, absolutely not required,

00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:39.735
to talk all the time about eating and drinking

00:56:39.936 --> 00:56:41.892
and invite others for supper.

00:56:42.093 --> 00:56:45.661
Then, in India we have caste system.

00:56:45.862 --> 00:56:47.938
Kayasth are separate,

00:56:48.139 --> 00:56:53.020
Hindu brahmins are separate and others are separate, even now.

00:56:53.221 --> 00:56:54.496
Now what happens,

00:56:54.697 --> 00:56:57.201
is that all the kayashth Sahaja Yogis form one group,

00:56:57.402 --> 00:56:59.412
brahmin Sahaja Yogis form another group.

00:56:59.613 --> 00:57:01.467
Now you all have become Sahaja Yogis,

00:57:01.668 --> 00:57:04.151
then why are you still worried about all this brahminism?

00:57:04.352 --> 00:57:07.553
Then kayasth will invite other kayasths for a meal.

00:57:07.754 --> 00:57:10.221
And brahmins will invite other brahmins for a meal.

00:57:10.422 --> 00:57:12.467
If you have to do this kind of stupidity,

00:57:12.668 --> 00:57:14.745
then why did you come to Sahaja Yoga?

00:57:14.946 --> 00:57:18.433
There is no caste and creed in Sahaja Yoga.

00:57:18.634 --> 00:57:22.147
When you cannot drop this fundamentally wrong thing,

00:57:22.348 --> 00:57:24.695
then what else can you drop?

00:57:24.896 --> 00:57:27.298
Did Shiv Ji bother about caste and creed?

00:57:27.499 --> 00:57:30.409
Even someone with a blind eye,

00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:33.290
someone with broken leg, someone with broken hands,

00:57:33.491 --> 00:57:35.742
all kind of deformed people

00:57:35.943 --> 00:57:38.450
accompanied Him in His marriage procession.

00:57:38.651 --> 00:57:45.678
So when Shiva tattwa is like this it is wrong for you to be critical

00:57:45.879 --> 00:57:52.721
and say: "I am very particular that the food should be like this".

00:57:52.922 --> 00:57:55.984
And then separate food for kayasth, separate for brahmins,

00:57:56.185 --> 00:57:59.081
separate for other casts and separate for rajputs,

00:57:59.312 --> 00:58:00.857
separate for everyone:

00:58:01.058 --> 00:58:02.843
"Now, we want only that food".

00:58:03.044 --> 00:58:06.806
I have never understood, till now I could not understand,

00:58:07.007 --> 00:58:10.530
if there is more pleasure in eating different foods,

00:58:10.731 --> 00:58:14.693
then why do these people ask only for a particular type of food.

00:58:15.250 --> 00:58:18.464
What is the reason? For bengalies, bengali food,

00:58:18.665 --> 00:58:21.706
for madrasis, madrasi food.

00:58:22.119 --> 00:58:26.647
Once I asked in our Airforce, I mean in the Airlines:

00:58:26.848 --> 00:58:29.347
"Why there is no good standard food?”.

00:58:29.548 --> 00:58:34.584
They said: "Mother, tell us what is India's standard food?".

00:58:34.785 --> 00:58:36.893
This is very true.

00:58:37.094 --> 00:58:40.171
If you prepare some food, they will say: "This is Madrasi food".

00:58:40.372 --> 00:58:45.675
Madrasi will say: "This is Bihari food", this and that and that.

00:58:45.876 --> 00:58:51.143
So, that's why you should eat all types of food.

00:58:53.186 --> 00:58:55.659
Because everything starts from here itself.

00:58:55.834 --> 00:58:58.254
This Vaikhari, your speech,

00:58:58.421 --> 00:59:01.978
in your speech as well, there should be sweetness,

00:59:02.179 --> 00:59:04.171
there should be madhurya.

00:59:04.372 --> 00:59:06.792
In the smiles also, it feels sometimes,

00:59:06.993 --> 00:59:10.487
as if Ravana is emerging out of the mouth.

00:59:10.851 --> 00:59:13.233
Then what can be said about the way they talk?

00:59:13.434 --> 00:59:17.474
And when they talk, it feels as if Chandika is talking.

00:59:17.675 --> 00:59:21.089
Women particularly create this fuss.

00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:24.047
Even men do it.

00:59:24.248 --> 00:59:27.145
Various weird things have come up letely.

00:59:27.346 --> 00:59:31.427
Where is Shiva tattwa in this?

00:59:31.886 --> 00:59:35.899
Lord Shiva is the ocean of love.

00:59:36.406 --> 00:59:40.429
He bestows boons even on rakshasas.

00:59:41.591 --> 00:59:44.484
Shri Shiva who has bestowed boons even on rakshasas -

00:59:44.685 --> 00:59:47.189
if we have to awaken His tattawa within us,

00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:51.785
then how could we get entangled in petty matters like these?

00:59:51.986 --> 00:59:54.752
How can we do this? Tell me.

00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:59.355
The way we criticize each other,

00:59:59.556 --> 01:00:02.981
some say "He is superior", some say "He is inferior",

01:00:03.182 --> 01:00:05.513
it is not like Lord Shiva.

01:00:05.714 --> 01:00:09.944
The streams of love are flowing within Lord Shiva.

01:00:10.995 --> 01:00:14.295
And while flowing in these streams of love –

01:00:14.496 --> 01:00:19.983
you should not say such baseless things.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.795
There is no use of it.

01:00:23.775 --> 01:00:25.745
Mutual love,

01:00:25.946 --> 01:00:28.230
mutual understanding

01:00:28.431 --> 01:00:34.659
and the company of each other should be enjoyed.

01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:36.406
Now definitely,

01:00:36.607 --> 01:00:39.656
Sahaja Yogis do not fight with each other, I have seen that.

01:00:39.857 --> 01:00:42.574
And when they meet each other, they meet with love.

01:00:42.775 --> 01:00:47.078
But still, even now very petty matters, which are very personal,

01:00:47.279 --> 01:00:50.811
like eating, drinking, moving around and other daily activities,

01:00:51.012 --> 01:00:53.278
need to be corrected.

01:00:54.051 --> 01:00:57.080
If we correct them it will be wonderful.

01:00:57.281 --> 01:01:00.822
Your attention will go towards your heart,

01:01:01.044 --> 01:01:04.129
and will not remain in these things,

01:01:04.330 --> 01:01:06.338
will not remain in these matters.

01:01:06.539 --> 01:01:08.898
This disease is more in foreign countries.

01:01:09.099 --> 01:01:12.877
That's why many enterpreneurs are popping up

01:01:13.078 --> 01:01:15.819
and they manufacture various kinds of things.

01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:21.448
And those who wear such things start thinking very high of themselves.

01:01:22.311 --> 01:01:25.483
Particularly in Italy this is quite popular.

01:01:25.684 --> 01:01:31.074
But you should not get caught in all these things.

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:33.598
You should lead a simple life.

01:01:33.799 --> 01:01:38.297
In our country, people who lead a simple life

01:01:38.498 --> 01:01:40.709
have attained great heights.

01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:43.545
Others cannot achieve this.

01:01:43.746 --> 01:01:48.251
In the olden days when Gandhiji asked everyone to wear khadi cloth,

01:01:48.452 --> 01:01:51.067
everyone obeyed and wore khadi.

01:01:51.268 --> 01:01:54.017
He made such a rule

01:01:54.218 --> 01:01:56.791
and set everybody right.

01:01:56.992 --> 01:02:00.376
But now you have to set yourself right.

01:02:00.577 --> 01:02:05.119
Because you yourself are the light of the Spirit,

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:11.263
you youreself have come under the protection of Shri Shiva.

01:02:11.953 --> 01:02:14.483
You have to correct yourself on your own.

01:02:14.684 --> 01:02:17.325
You don't need to correct others,

01:02:17.526 --> 01:02:19.097
but just correct yourself

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:22.137
and feel blessed that you are a Self Realized person.

01:02:22.338 --> 01:02:24.006
How many were there earlier?

01:02:24.207 --> 01:02:27.040
Only a few of them and people used to kill them as well.

01:02:27.241 --> 01:02:31.646
Today you are in thousands, so start doing this.

01:02:31.847 --> 01:02:33.745
Sweetness in your talk,

01:02:33.946 --> 01:02:36.094
not superficially but from the heart.

01:02:36.295 --> 01:02:40.682
Whatever you say from your heart, never hurts anyone.

01:02:41.266 --> 01:02:42.905
So you talk from your heart,

01:02:43.112 --> 01:02:45.658
with children, with elderly people,

01:02:45.859 --> 01:02:48.239
following the "maryadas" of good conduct.

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:52.326
When you make yourself happy,

01:02:52.527 --> 01:02:54.786
you will make others happy as well.

01:02:54.987 --> 01:03:00.521
But, if the blessing of Shri Shiva is missing within you,

01:03:00.722 --> 01:03:03.790
which makes you content,

01:03:04.055 --> 01:03:06.059
nothing else can make you content.

01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:10.503
So pay attention to yourself and see: "Am I content or not?

01:03:10.704 --> 01:03:12.583
Do I have satisfaction or not?

01:03:12.784 --> 01:03:18.916
Do I get angry with others over small, small things

01:03:19.117 --> 01:03:22.171
or do I find faults with them?

01:03:22.372 --> 01:03:25.075
Then definitely there is something wrong with me".

01:03:25.276 --> 01:03:29.062
And only after seeing these faults, you can get cleansed.

01:03:29.263 --> 01:03:33.586
Until you see something, how can you clean it?

01:03:33.787 --> 01:03:35.656
This cleansing is much needed.

01:03:35.855 --> 01:03:37.614
And only by this cleansing,

01:03:37.822 --> 01:03:43.731
you can have the "darshan" of God Almighty within yourself.

01:03:43.932 --> 01:03:46.587
And all the people can have His "darshan" as well.

01:03:46.788 --> 01:03:50.404
Wish you have infinite blessings.

01:04:02.908 --> 01:04:06.450
It's a very long lecture I have given in Hindi language

01:04:06.651 --> 01:04:11.477
and because there are very few, also, Sahaja Yogis from abroad.

01:04:11.678 --> 01:04:16.712
What I was telling them was that about the principle of Shiva

01:04:16.913 --> 01:04:19.623
is in your heart,

01:04:19.824 --> 01:04:25.919
and that reflection is not on a chakra, but on a… like a mirror.

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:31.146
Now, whatever is visible of you

01:04:31.748 --> 01:04:33.770
is this mirror.

01:04:33.971 --> 01:04:37.611
In this mirror, what reflection you have?

01:04:37.812 --> 01:04:42.586
Do you have a reflection, which is clear, clean?

01:04:42.787 --> 01:04:45.435
Have you cleaned your heart?

01:04:45.636 --> 01:04:52.356
Have you cleaned your mirror that is reflecting?

01:04:52.557 --> 01:04:54.642
That is what one has to see.

01:04:54.843 --> 01:04:57.596
Now, what I told them at length was this,

01:04:57.797 --> 01:05:02.887
that how there are six enemies we have got.

01:05:03.088 --> 01:05:09.160
And all these six enemies, one after another, try to corrupt us.

01:05:09.556 --> 01:05:11.724
Out of that, I have told them about five.

01:05:11.925 --> 01:05:17.016
The sixth one doesn’t exist much in India, which we call as lust,

01:05:17.217 --> 01:05:18.637
it's much less.

01:05:18.838 --> 01:05:22.411
But, for foreign countries one has to know

01:05:22.612 --> 01:05:26.611
that it is one of the major things that they have in the West,

01:05:26.812 --> 01:05:30.655
because they think lustful life is the only life worth living.

01:05:30.856 --> 01:05:33.420
Beyond that is Shiva.

01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:39.894
And that’s why we have to understood that, we have to understand

01:05:40.095 --> 01:05:42.476
that in our heart,

01:05:42.677 --> 01:05:48.618
the reflection of Shiva is only possible in complete form

01:05:48.819 --> 01:05:51.168
when we have cleaned our heart.

01:05:51.369 --> 01:05:53.449
To have malice for others,

01:05:53.648 --> 01:05:57.457
to have lust for others,

01:05:57.658 --> 01:06:01.737
to have anger for others,

01:06:02.086 --> 01:06:05.603
to have envy for others,

01:06:06.081 --> 01:06:09.216
all these reactions within us act,

01:06:09.417 --> 01:06:12.340
and our heart becomes like a stone,

01:06:12.539 --> 01:06:14.874
it cannot reflect.

01:06:15.075 --> 01:06:18.337
So, if you have to reflect the quality of Shiva,

01:06:18.538 --> 01:06:21.708
which is very important today, in this Kali Yuga...

01:06:21.909 --> 01:06:26.733
Very, there are very few people who are really reflecting

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:32.038
the image of Shiva in their own character.

01:06:32.239 --> 01:06:34.609
So, it is important to watch yourself

01:06:34.784 --> 01:06:37.202
and see for yourself what’s wrong with you:

01:06:37.403 --> 01:06:39.929
"Where am I? Where is my attention going?

01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:42.436
Where am I going? What am I doing?",

01:06:42.637 --> 01:06:46.718
if you go on judging yourself and not others.

01:06:46.919 --> 01:06:50.152
Also, one of the western things is that,

01:06:50.353 --> 01:06:56.057
they have a right to criticize others, everybody.

01:06:56.258 --> 01:06:58.407
"I like it, I don’t like it”.

01:06:58.608 --> 01:07:01.316
Who are you? Why do you say such a thing?

01:07:01.517 --> 01:07:04.965
Somebody had made a beautiful, say, arrangement for you;

01:07:05.166 --> 01:07:08.911
you sit in his house and nicely say:  “I don’t like it”,

01:07:09.112 --> 01:07:11.901
to hurt that person.

01:07:12.743 --> 01:07:14.719
After all, who are you?

01:07:14.934 --> 01:07:17.367
What do you think of yourself?

01:07:17.568 --> 01:07:19.023
Who are you to judge?

01:07:19.224 --> 01:07:22.122
For Sahaja Yoga, Yogis, is prohibited

01:07:22.323 --> 01:07:25.606
to say, “I like” and “I don’t like.”

01:07:25.807 --> 01:07:28.393
It's prohibited.

01:07:28.594 --> 01:07:31.827
Look at Shiva. He likes everything.

01:07:32.028 --> 01:07:35.466
What He wears? Also snakes.

01:07:35.667 --> 01:07:38.220
He likes all kinds of animals.

01:07:38.421 --> 01:07:40.083
Every type of thing

01:07:40.284 --> 01:07:43.878
that we think is not good, ugly, for Him they are not.

01:07:44.079 --> 01:07:48.832
For example, in His wedding He took with Him, in His bharat,

01:07:49.033 --> 01:07:51.726
people who were all infirm,

01:07:52.028 --> 01:07:53.808
some people had one leg,

01:07:54.009 --> 01:07:57.526
some people had limbs broken down,

01:07:57.727 --> 01:08:00.105
some had only one eye.

01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:02.686
All such people He carried with them.

01:08:02.887 --> 01:08:06.005
To Him, these people were very dear

01:08:06.206 --> 01:08:07.848
and He looked after them,

01:08:08.049 --> 01:08:10.763
because He is the source of joy.

01:08:10.964 --> 01:08:13.117
He is the One who gives us joy

01:08:13.318 --> 01:08:15.687
and the One that makes us joyous.

01:08:15.888 --> 01:08:18.169
The real joy is only possible

01:08:18.370 --> 01:08:21.991
if in your heart His reflection is there.

01:08:22.192 --> 01:08:24.698
But if your heart is full of all things,

01:08:24.899 --> 01:08:27.023
then once I have described,

01:08:27.224 --> 01:08:32.558
it becomes a dirty, very, very dirty mirror.

01:08:32.759 --> 01:08:35.010
Very surprising, I told them also,

01:08:35.185 --> 01:08:39.424
that compared to Indians, Westerners are not so particular -

01:08:39.625 --> 01:08:43.508
Western Sahaja Yogis - are not so particular about their comfort.

01:08:43.709 --> 01:08:46.475
Though they come from a very materialistic surrounding,

01:08:46.676 --> 01:08:48.226
they are not so much bothered.

01:08:48.427 --> 01:08:51.221
They can live anywhere, they can be happy anywhere.

01:08:51.356 --> 01:08:53.788
That’s a very good stage they have reached

01:08:53.989 --> 01:08:57.280
and that’s what’s the Indians must try to follow.

01:08:57.481 --> 01:09:00.341
And don’t pay attention to nonsensical things.

01:09:00.542 --> 01:09:05.055
It is not necessary to waste your energy on nonsensical thing.

01:09:05.256 --> 01:09:11.489
Then only you can have a real bhakti for your Self, for your Atma

01:09:11.690 --> 01:09:14.039
and that is what needed today,

01:09:14.230 --> 01:09:19.700
that your Spirit should shine in your character, in your behavior

01:09:19.901 --> 01:09:23.090
and in your personality.

01:09:23.291 --> 01:09:26.342
If that happens, then you have achieved,

01:09:26.518 --> 01:09:29.755
what Sahaja Yoga wanted to do for you.

01:09:29.956 --> 01:09:32.575
It's important today, very important.

01:09:32.776 --> 01:09:35.852
If you read the newspapers, you can’t read it.

01:09:36.053 --> 01:09:41.203
And what you need is to change - the transformation -

01:09:41.404 --> 01:09:44.434
as we in Hindi call it ‘pariwartan’

01:09:44.635 --> 01:09:48.909
of human beings into Selfhood, into Self-awareness,

01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:51.230
into the Spirit.

01:09:51.431 --> 01:09:52.704
This has to be done,

01:09:52.905 --> 01:09:55.779
and the time has come this evolutionary process has started.

01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:57.947
There are so many of them who have got it.

01:09:58.148 --> 01:10:05.169
Now the old saints and people who were gurus, real gurus,

01:10:05.370 --> 01:10:10.502
they used to really test the disciples

01:10:10.703 --> 01:10:14.937
by making them stand on their heads for years together,

01:10:15.138 --> 01:10:19.355
sometimes put them in the water, do all kinds of things.

01:10:19.821 --> 01:10:21.691
They used to beat them

01:10:21.892 --> 01:10:25.887
and they were very harsh, testing all of them.

01:10:26.088 --> 01:10:30.385
And then only, one of them used to get Realization.

01:10:31.283 --> 01:10:33.498
Now, what I thought of:

01:10:33.699 --> 01:10:37.737
"It takes too much time to cleanse them,

01:10:37.938 --> 01:10:43.313
to put them into all kinds of dresses, this that,

01:10:43.529 --> 01:10:47.486
send them to Himalayas or to Gobi Desert.

01:10:47.687 --> 01:10:49.848
I thought it will take too much time.

01:10:50.049 --> 01:10:54.685
I said why not first enlighten them, give them the light?

01:10:54.886 --> 01:10:57.004
In that light they can see their problems

01:10:57.205 --> 01:10:59.412
and they will themselves correct themself.

01:10:59.613 --> 01:11:01.290
They will be their own guru.

01:11:01.497 --> 01:11:04.894
And it was successful. It was good.

01:11:05.095 --> 01:11:08.148
Now you can see for yourself what you are doing,

01:11:08.349 --> 01:11:15.308
what is your problem, what makes you so much different from others

01:11:15.509 --> 01:11:17.992
and what will elevate you.

01:11:18.193 --> 01:11:23.171
Because Sadashiva’s place is above the head,

01:11:23.372 --> 01:11:26.346
above your thoughts, above your mind,

01:11:26.547 --> 01:11:27.975
above your emotions.

01:11:28.176 --> 01:11:29.330
It’s here.

01:11:29.531 --> 01:11:31.714
And you have to cross this limit.

01:11:31.915 --> 01:11:34.359
Only when you do not react to things,

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:41.320
and also to you nothing is important than Shiva,

01:11:41.521 --> 01:11:43.376
then only it will work out.

01:11:43.577 --> 01:11:46.114
So, in some things Indians have to learn,

01:11:46.315 --> 01:11:49.908
and in some things you foreigners have to learn.

01:11:50.109 --> 01:11:53.080
So many things you have done, I must thank you very much.

01:11:53.281 --> 01:11:55.226
People used to think that I cannot do anything.

01:11:55.427 --> 01:11:57.009
I mean you have given up drinking,

01:11:57.210 --> 01:11:59.501
you have given up all kinds of bad habits,

01:11:59.702 --> 01:12:02.817
you are no more womanizers, your attention is so clean.

01:12:03.018 --> 01:12:06.276
So many things you have done, which is really praise-worthy.

01:12:06.477 --> 01:12:07.863
But still,

01:12:08.094 --> 01:12:11.925
you must learn that still there are certain things lingering,

01:12:12.126 --> 01:12:14.163
which must be cleared out

01:12:14.364 --> 01:12:17.162
and must be absolutely finished.

01:12:17.363 --> 01:12:19.920
You don’t have very much politics

01:12:20.121 --> 01:12:24.463
but sometimes there is also politics, group forming is there.

01:12:24.655 --> 01:12:26.055
All this has to go away.

01:12:26.256 --> 01:12:30.101
Because for Shiva, what is this? The whole universe is at His feet.

01:12:30.302 --> 01:12:35.094
To Him to have a one group here and a one group there,

01:12:35.295 --> 01:12:36.879
all that doesn’t matter.

01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:40.663
To Him, it doesn’t come into His head, you see.

01:12:40.864 --> 01:12:45.756
For a person like a very big ocean, it touches many shores.

01:12:45.957 --> 01:12:48.538
But in itself it is a big ocean.

01:12:48.768 --> 01:12:51.345
In the same way is Shiva principle.

01:12:51.546 --> 01:12:54.631
And you all should develop that principle of Shiva.

01:12:54.832 --> 01:12:56.662
And then see the joy.

01:12:56.863 --> 01:13:01.540
the joy of this great ocean of love.

01:13:01.741 --> 01:13:05.106
May God bless you.
