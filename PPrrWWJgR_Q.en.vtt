00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:28.691
First, I‘ll speak in Hindi language

00:03:28.892 --> 00:03:32.552
and then in English language.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:44.764
Today we have assembled here to worship Shri Maha Deva,

00:03:45.082 --> 00:03:48.899
Shri Shiva Shankar.

00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:55.826
In the name of Shankarji,

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:59.628
many organizations have come up in this world.

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:05.466
Because of Adi Shankaracharya’s emphasis,

00:04:05.667 --> 00:04:10.724
worshipping ShivJi is being done by people in a big way.

00:04:10.925 --> 00:04:16.497
And in Southern India two types of sects have come up:

00:04:16.698 --> 00:04:19.890
one which is called as Shaivites,

00:04:20.091 --> 00:04:23.441
and the other are calles as Vaishnavites.

00:04:24.278 --> 00:04:28.937
Now Shaivites are the worshippers of Lord Shiva

00:04:29.138 --> 00:04:32.972
and the Vaishnavites, who worship Lord Vishnu.

00:04:34.088 --> 00:04:39.827
In our country we are expert in dividing ourselves.

00:04:40.028 --> 00:04:43.299
We divide Deities as well;

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.210
and when we try to reunite them, then things take a very bad  shape.

00:04:49.411 --> 00:04:53.364
For example, a new thing has come up, by name Ayyappa.

00:04:53.565 --> 00:04:56.388
It is a very wrong thing.

00:04:56.589 --> 00:05:01.039
And in that it is shown that,

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.430
that when Lord Vishnu assumed the form of "Mohini",

00:05:05.631 --> 00:05:09.019
then she got a child from Lord Shiva.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.550
Is it possible by any chance?

00:05:11.751 --> 00:05:15.975
Such nonsensical beliefs are generally spread in our country,

00:05:16.176 --> 00:05:19.279
And then different groups are formed on those beliefs.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.612
When Indians find some or other reason to fight,

00:05:22.813 --> 00:05:25.220
they become very happy.

00:05:25.421 --> 00:05:29.144
If they have nothing to fight over,

00:05:29.345 --> 00:05:35.660
then, they create something from their own imaginations.

00:05:36.358 --> 00:05:41.948
So these two things are connected with each other

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:46.759
as sun is with sun light,

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.889
word with its meaning, moon with moonlight.

00:05:51.093 --> 00:05:57.726
Meaning that the `Sopan Marga’ which has been created,

00:05:57.927 --> 00:06:04.983
which we, call as sushumna nadi, which is central path,

00:06:05.184 --> 00:06:07.669
is the path of Lord Vishnu.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.436
And through this path we attain the Shiva Tattva.

00:06:12.637 --> 00:06:17.349
So Shiva tattwa is the destination to Shiva,

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.356
and the path is made by Lord Vishnu.

00:06:22.557 --> 00:06:27.991
To create this path Vishnuji and Adishakti have taken efforts.

00:06:28.192 --> 00:06:30.371
Lord Shiva has no role in it:

00:06:30.572 --> 00:06:32.450
He sits comfortably in his Seat,

00:06:32.651 --> 00:06:36.641
not bothering about anyone who comes or doesn't come.

00:06:36.842 --> 00:06:39.569
So, to attain this Shiva tattwa,

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.563
we should go through this Vishnu path (Sushumna path)

00:06:42.764 --> 00:06:45.201
and for that, the several chakras (centres) in us,

00:06:45.402 --> 00:06:47.932
have to be corrected first.

00:06:48.133 --> 00:06:50.364
When the centers are corrected,

00:06:50.565 --> 00:06:53.109
our Vishnu path opens up.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:59.106
And along with that, we gradually start ascending.

00:06:59.307 --> 00:07:02.426
I have told about all these centers, many a times.

00:07:02.627 --> 00:07:07.101
But, there is a center in Heart also, which we call `Left Heart’.

00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:09.648
This is not the chakra of the heart (central heart),

00:07:09.873 --> 00:07:12.478
it is just the heart,

00:07:12.677 --> 00:07:20.390
which reflects the reflection of Mahadeva.

00:07:20.591 --> 00:07:24.967
The abode of Shiva is above everything,

00:07:25.168 --> 00:07:29.515
beyond the mind, beyond the thoughts.

00:07:29.716 --> 00:07:32.630
To attain this kind of tatwa (principle),

00:07:32.831 --> 00:07:36.012
first and foremost we should pay attention,

00:07:36.213 --> 00:07:40.983
is to see how pure our heart is.

00:07:42.826 --> 00:07:48.801
Inside our heart, we allow a lot dirt to grow.

00:07:49.002 --> 00:07:53.796
For example, we feel jeolous of someone.

00:07:54.489 --> 00:08:00.764
Feeling jeolous - in the sense, if somebody has been evil to you,

00:08:00.965 --> 00:08:04.653
might have harmed you also, troubled you.

00:08:04.854 --> 00:08:08.165
But there is no use becoming jeolous of them.

00:08:08.366 --> 00:08:10.404
If your heart is clean

00:08:10.618 --> 00:08:16.592
then the mirror in which the God almighty's reflection is going to fall,

00:08:16.793 --> 00:08:18.596
will be very clear.

00:08:18.797 --> 00:08:22.316
But if you are full of jealousy,

00:08:23.925 --> 00:08:25.935
then the mirror will not remain clean

00:08:26.136 --> 00:08:28.734
and the reflection of God will also not be perfect.

00:08:28.935 --> 00:08:31.229
To have enmity towards anyone

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:35.927
and towards anyone to have in the heart

00:08:36.128 --> 00:08:39.075
any kind of miserable thoughts or ill feeling,

00:08:39.276 --> 00:08:41.401
is very wrong.

00:08:41.602 --> 00:08:46.462
That is why Christ has said to forgive everyone.

00:08:46.663 --> 00:08:49.256
To forgive is extremely important.

00:08:49.457 --> 00:08:55.683
And before and after Christ many saints have said the same thing,

00:08:55.884 --> 00:08:57.585
that forgive everybody.

00:08:57.786 --> 00:09:02.807
The moment you forgive, immediately Lord Shiva,

00:09:03.322 --> 00:09:06.352
takes the situation in His hands.

00:09:06.553 --> 00:09:11.543
The subtlest power of all is that of Shri Mahadev.

00:09:11.744 --> 00:09:18.124
And He, then completely punishes him,

00:09:18.325 --> 00:09:21.909
totally punishes him.

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:25.858
This is the work of Lord Mahadev, not yours.

00:09:26.059 --> 00:09:29.959
Therefore to be jealous of anyone is very bad.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.976
But I find that there is lot of jealousy even in Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:34.177 --> 00:09:37.257
Sahaja Yogis are jealous of one another.

00:09:37.458 --> 00:09:40.552
If one person is made trustee, the other one is not,

00:09:40.753 --> 00:09:42.367
then he is jealous.

00:09:42.568 --> 00:09:45.044
This trusteeship and all have no meaning,

00:09:45.219 --> 00:09:47.266
you all know it is a myth.

00:09:47.467 --> 00:09:49.859
It is all your Mother's drama

00:09:50.066 --> 00:09:52.226
and She has spread a web of maya.

00:09:52.427 --> 00:09:55.477
Even then the mind of the people gets corrupted;

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.183
For one mind gets disturbed

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:00.509
and for the other the heart gets disturbed!

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:03.542
I do not understand what should I do!

00:10:03.743 --> 00:10:06.614
Such a big work is happening in so many countries,

00:10:06.813 --> 00:10:10.310
so I can communicate with any one person only, right?

00:10:10.511 --> 00:10:13.538
However, things are getting sorted out slowly,

00:10:13.739 --> 00:10:17.403
but still you will be surprised

00:10:17.604 --> 00:10:20.562
that even now there is lot of discussion

00:10:20.763 --> 00:10:24.015
about who is the leader and who is what?

00:10:24.216 --> 00:10:28.053
Second thing is, for us, for Indians,

00:10:28.254 --> 00:10:33.260
a "blessing" is

00:10:33.461 --> 00:10:37.596
the jealousy is in money matters.

00:10:38.294 --> 00:10:42.469
Even in Sahaja Yoga there is jealousy on money matters.

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:46.215
Someone has got more money and some less.

00:10:46.416 --> 00:10:48.860
While doing Sahaja work also

00:10:49.138 --> 00:10:52.095
people see how much money one gets,

00:10:52.278 --> 00:10:54.243
and who gives how much money?

00:10:54.444 --> 00:10:57.125
If a person's heart gets involved with money

00:10:57.394 --> 00:11:00.662
he becomes useless for Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:00.863 --> 00:11:07.366
Because his heart gets covered with materialism.

00:11:07.567 --> 00:11:12.804
If any kind of materialism has enveloped your heart,

00:11:13.005 --> 00:11:16.092
then it is very difficult for you to ascend.

00:11:16.293 --> 00:11:17.939
This is the speciality of our country.

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.201
I have not seen it so much in foreign countries.

00:11:20.402 --> 00:11:22.619
But here it is prominent.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:26.086
I think, in Russia and Eastern Block countries

00:11:26.287 --> 00:11:28.126
there is very little of wealth,

00:11:28.327 --> 00:11:30.332
but they are not bothered at all.

00:11:30.555 --> 00:11:32.427
They don't think about money at all.

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:36.438
But their heart is so pure, so very pure.

00:11:36.639 --> 00:11:40.031
And only with the pure heart, devotion (bhakti) is possible.

00:11:40.232 --> 00:11:44.934
We all, before doing prayers, wash our feet and take bath.

00:11:45.135 --> 00:11:48.027
But bathing our heart is possible

00:11:48.228 --> 00:11:49.686
if we could ask God,

00:11:49.887 --> 00:11:53.825
that whatever negativities are there within us,

00:11:54.026 --> 00:11:56.251
to please remove them and purify us,

00:11:56.452 --> 00:11:58.939
then it will be much better.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.709
The third thing is the negativity within us,

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:05.733
which we call as six enemies (shadripu),

00:12:05.949 --> 00:12:10.568
Shri Krishna has emphasised that krodha (anger) is the worst thing.

00:12:10.769 --> 00:12:12.660
Everything emanates from anger.

00:12:12.861 --> 00:12:14.785
A person shows anger initially,

00:12:14.986 --> 00:12:16.952
then he gets infatuated.

00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:19.952
Then he thinks: "Why did I say all that, I should not have said it",

00:12:20.153 --> 00:12:21.417
and so on.

00:12:21.618 --> 00:12:24.582
But he goes out of self-control, when he gets angry.

00:12:24.786 --> 00:12:28.394
In the fit of anger he loses control over himself.

00:12:28.595 --> 00:12:30.473
He goes out of self-control

00:12:30.674 --> 00:12:33.882
and he throw words, which are meaningless.

00:12:34.083 --> 00:12:38.246
The dirt he has been accumalating since long in his heart,

00:12:38.445 --> 00:12:41.952
comes out of his mouth.

00:12:42.752 --> 00:12:44.408
We have to beware of this krodha

00:12:44.609 --> 00:12:47.891
"Why does this anger come?" - we should pay attention to this,

00:12:48.092 --> 00:12:50.592
that why do we get angry.

00:12:50.793 --> 00:12:52.999
There are some who are angry with a particular person,

00:12:53.227 --> 00:12:55.945
there are some who are angry with the society.

00:12:56.146 --> 00:12:59.435
Like this, people show their anger in different ways.

00:12:59.636 --> 00:13:02.721
Why does this anger come to us?

00:13:02.922 --> 00:13:06.309
Why do we get angry? - we should think that.

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:08.505
Many people have told Me that,

00:13:08.706 --> 00:13:13.406
"Mother, if someone speaks against You, we get very angry".

00:13:13.607 --> 00:13:15.256
I feel like laughing at this.

00:13:15.457 --> 00:13:19.916
If anybody talks against Me, I really feel like laughing.

00:13:20.117 --> 00:13:23.682
Because there is no meaning. What is there to talk against Me?

00:13:23.883 --> 00:13:27.012
I am just sharing my love, even then if they speak against Me.

00:13:27.213 --> 00:13:28.431
What can be done?

00:13:28.632 --> 00:13:30.934
But some people have crooked mind,

00:13:31.133 --> 00:13:33.410
so we should only pity them.

00:13:33.886 --> 00:13:37.436
We have to think that such a person is a big fool.

00:13:37.637 --> 00:13:41.871
When a person is full of anger, then our attitude towards him,

00:13:42.072 --> 00:13:46.661
should be deeply compassionate.

00:13:46.862 --> 00:13:49.614
This attitude may also cool down his anger.

00:13:49.815 --> 00:13:53.606
In our country there are angry people of different types.

00:13:53.807 --> 00:13:55.561
There are institutions for that

00:13:55.762 --> 00:13:58.698
who spread with their anger: "Hit this person, hit that person",

00:13:58.865 --> 00:14:00.765
"Beat up this person, beat up that person".

00:14:00.956 --> 00:14:04.303
And this is also becoming an issue at the social level.

00:14:04.504 --> 00:14:08.050
This is a very dangerous situation.

00:14:08.298 --> 00:14:10.046
To beat and thrash people,

00:14:10.247 --> 00:14:15.037
and for that purpose to form an army

00:14:15.238 --> 00:14:18.149
or prepare some weapons to beat and hurt people

00:14:18.332 --> 00:14:19.950
is very terrifying.

00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:26.989
However, for protection, a person is equipped with these weapons,

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:28.847
it is not a big deal.

00:14:29.046 --> 00:14:31.971
But, if he is a devotee of the God almighty,

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:34.512
he doent require these weapons.

00:14:34.713 --> 00:14:37.801
This kind of a person is always protected.

00:14:38.002 --> 00:14:43.527
When within a person Shri Mahadev resides,

00:14:43.728 --> 00:14:46.312
Who can dare to touch such a person,

00:14:46.542 --> 00:14:48.436
who can destroy him?

00:14:48.637 --> 00:14:51.337
Whatever you do, however you trouble him,

00:14:51.538 --> 00:14:54.400
still that person cannot be destroyed.

00:14:54.601 --> 00:14:58.026
But those who harass them, will get destroyed themselves.

00:14:58.227 --> 00:15:01.572
When the complete trust regarding this will come within you,

00:15:01.773 --> 00:15:04.671
that whoever is troubling you will get destroyed,

00:15:04.878 --> 00:15:09.285
then you will keep your heart totally pure and clean..

00:15:09.486 --> 00:15:12.666
This work can happen only in a clean heart,

00:15:12.867 --> 00:15:16.912
because Shri Shiva resides in our heart, as reflection,

00:15:17.113 --> 00:15:21.831
and the reflection falls better on a cleaner mirror.

00:15:22.032 --> 00:15:24.918
Shiva Ji's anger is a one time job,

00:15:25.119 --> 00:15:27.953
or rather people say that He gets angry only once.

00:15:28.154 --> 00:15:30.998
But I have seen him getting angry many a times,

00:15:31.199 --> 00:15:33.556
because it is His right.

00:15:33.757 --> 00:15:36.005
He has a right to be angry.

00:15:36.206 --> 00:15:39.933
If anyone works against Adi Shakti,

00:15:40.134 --> 00:15:42.213
then Shiv Ji has very long hands.

00:15:42.412 --> 00:15:45.683
Without listening to anyone, He finishes such a person.

00:15:45.884 --> 00:15:49.834
Because he knows that Shri Adi Shakti will not do anything Herself.

00:15:50.035 --> 00:15:53.739
She is not going to punish anyone at all,

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.694
and She will forgive everyone.

00:15:55.895 --> 00:15:58.017
So, His hands are so long,

00:15:58.256 --> 00:16:00.015
that there is no limit to them

00:16:00.216 --> 00:16:03.782
and when those hands start lashing, then nobody can stop them.

00:16:03.983 --> 00:16:05.825
Who is above Him?

00:16:06.026 --> 00:16:08.222
He has got his own protocols,

00:16:08.423 --> 00:16:12.398
which you can neither change nor go beyond.

00:16:14.113 --> 00:16:18.953
This is how you should understand that in your individual life

00:16:19.154 --> 00:16:23.874
In Sahaja Yoga you have to follow only Lord Shiva.

00:16:24.075 --> 00:16:28.489
Because, if you don't follow Him, firstly,

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.136
You will get heart problems.

00:16:42.679 --> 00:16:45.924
The first thing will be heart disease.

00:16:46.644 --> 00:16:48.907
It works out in two ways.

00:16:49.108 --> 00:16:52.772
Firstly with excessive anger the heart catches,

00:16:53.357 --> 00:16:57.583
and secondly, after the anger if a person repents,

00:16:57.784 --> 00:17:01.447
then he gets the disease called "angina".

00:17:01.648 --> 00:17:04.632
This is how both the things are useless.

00:17:04.833 --> 00:17:06.806
But anger doesn't go just by words.

00:17:06.974 --> 00:17:08.799
This is something like taking alcohol.

00:17:09.013 --> 00:17:10.874
It becomes a habit to get angry.

00:17:11.075 --> 00:17:13.751
Without his knowledge, his face gets swollen,

00:17:13.952 --> 00:17:17.423
he gets extremly angry and no one can control him.

00:17:17.624 --> 00:17:20.365
So, I thought that if you sit before the mirror

00:17:20.566 --> 00:17:23.589
and get angry on yourself,

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:26.547
rebuke yourself with few angry words

00:17:26.748 --> 00:17:29.785
and by sitting in front of the mirror if you say:

00:17:29.986 --> 00:17:32.543
"There cannot be a greater fool than me",

00:17:32.744 --> 00:17:36.313
then perhaps you may get rid of your anger.

00:17:36.514 --> 00:17:38.173
I am saying might be possible,

00:17:38.374 --> 00:17:41.767
because at times, these problems are so intricate,

00:17:41.968 --> 00:17:44.990
that it is very difficult to solve them.

00:17:45.595 --> 00:17:47.575
Further, it has been observed

00:17:47.776 --> 00:17:54.441
that the more we focus our attention on something

00:17:54.642 --> 00:18:00.979
and we react to it...

00:18:01.944 --> 00:18:04.982
Someone says something and we react instantly to it -

00:18:05.183 --> 00:18:08.381
this custom is more in the foreign countries.

00:18:08.582 --> 00:18:10.233
For example there is a carpet -

00:18:10.434 --> 00:18:14.620
immediately they will say, “I don’t like it, I like it.”

00:18:14.821 --> 00:18:17.032
Who are you to say all this?

00:18:17.233 --> 00:18:21.715
Nowadays it`s a fashion to say: "I like it, I don’t like it",

00:18:21.916 --> 00:18:26.622
as if every person were a renowned master

00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:29.697
who says `I like it’, `I don’t like it’.

00:18:30.241 --> 00:18:31.551
This should not be said.

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:34.837
Saying this is the indication of your bad Agnya.

00:18:35.182 --> 00:18:36.979
What do you think of yourself

00:18:37.257 --> 00:18:40.233
that you are saying "I like it, I don't like it".

00:18:41.913 --> 00:18:47.021
You do not have a right to like or dislike any of the things.

00:18:47.426 --> 00:18:49.751
Supposing, some poor man gives you with affection,

00:18:49.942 --> 00:18:52.457
some very beautiful flowers,

00:18:52.823 --> 00:18:55.227
and you will say "sir, I don't like this flowers".

00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:00.909
You are unable to understand the hidden emotions behind
this act

00:19:01.132 --> 00:19:03.409
because Shiva Tattva is absent in you.

00:19:04.595 --> 00:19:06.510
Even if it is a very smaal thing,

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:09.518
which has been given to you by a poor person,

00:19:09.977 --> 00:19:12.992
and you don't,

00:19:13.302 --> 00:19:15.778
recognise the feeling attached to the emotion,

00:19:16.005 --> 00:19:18.195
and how lovingly he has given you that.

00:19:18.853 --> 00:19:23.242
For that in India we have the example of Sudama, has been shown.

00:19:23.513 --> 00:19:27.786
That how He arrived with roasted rice to meet Shri Krishna.

00:19:28.302 --> 00:19:31.397
And how Shri Krishna honoured Him.

00:19:32.464 --> 00:19:35.482
Anything presented with the feelings of love

00:19:35.951 --> 00:19:38.545
is exactly like, a piece of glass,

00:19:38.746 --> 00:19:42.185
becomes a shining mirror when paras (touch stone) is applied to it

00:19:43.106 --> 00:19:46.669
similarly, if you have feelings of love for someone,

00:19:46.931 --> 00:19:50.334
a very beautiful and good feeling, but you have no money,

00:19:50.684 --> 00:19:54.731
then, even if you gift that person a very small thing, then

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:58.703
the other person should think "aha! what an excellent thing is this"

00:19:59.331 --> 00:20:04.783
But, this feeling of love gives a subtle sight to the person.

00:20:05.423 --> 00:20:07.827
which can be called as artistic.

00:20:08.225 --> 00:20:10.645
artistic qualities emanates from it.

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:12.387
When art is visible from it,

00:20:12.793 --> 00:20:15.030
you start thinking how artistic thing is this.

00:20:15.531 --> 00:20:19.200
This art is the art of love, this is the art of love.

00:20:19.359 --> 00:20:22.914
By this art you can clearly see that,

00:20:23.279 --> 00:20:25.604
how much of love is there in this person?

00:20:26.001 --> 00:20:27.370
How affectionate he is.

00:20:27.767 --> 00:20:33.116
How loving he is, what a gentleman is he, what a good person is he.

00:20:33.704 --> 00:20:36.106
When you start seeing this quality in others

00:20:36.307 --> 00:20:38.408
then you will look within yourself,

00:20:38.614 --> 00:20:41.591
and you will start thinking "What am I?”

00:20:42.551 --> 00:20:44.558
“Do I have that much of love?”

00:20:44.791 --> 00:20:46.537
“do I have this gentleman qualities"?

00:20:46.783 --> 00:20:48.481
"Do I have all this goodness within me,

00:20:48.682 --> 00:20:51.243
or am I rendering lip service only"?

00:20:53.591 --> 00:20:55.741
and thus misleading the people"?

00:20:56.425 --> 00:20:59.178
Actually, we are misleading ourselves and none other.

00:20:59.551 --> 00:21:02.686
When we are doing wrong things, living a wrong lifestyle,

00:21:03.168 --> 00:21:05.255
when in our lives are completely

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:08.062
filled with wrong conceptions,

00:21:08.372 --> 00:21:10.404
then we can not make anyone happy.

00:21:10.864 --> 00:21:13.007
and definitely not ourselves also.

00:21:13.348 --> 00:21:15.376
So from the point of view of “swartha”,

00:21:15.553 --> 00:21:19.600
the word "Swa" is very beautiful,"to know thyself" (swa ka arth)

00:21:20.204 --> 00:21:23.727
"Swa" means spirit, you must know the meaning of it.

00:21:24.102 --> 00:21:27.387
To know the meaning, people worship Shiv Ji.

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:32.131
But I have seen that the worshipers of Shiva are very hot tempered,

00:21:33.393 --> 00:21:37.893
very ill tempered , very miserly and what not.

00:21:38.606 --> 00:21:43.828
No deity is as generous Shiv JI, no one is as loving as ShivJi.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:48.406
This source of love which is flowing today all around,

00:21:48.605 --> 00:21:50.430
is emanating from His Holy feet.

00:21:50.787 --> 00:21:53.660
It is because of Him, this work is happening.

00:21:53.803 --> 00:21:57.806
that human beings are bathing in the ocean of love in Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:58.261 --> 00:22:02.273
In Sahaja Yoga after Self-realization, when you attain that state,

00:22:02.573 --> 00:22:03.904
then you,

00:22:05.001 --> 00:22:06.923
the state of say Jiva Atma,

00:22:07.867 --> 00:22:09.427
or your,

00:22:10.536 --> 00:22:11.902
attention,

00:22:12.414 --> 00:22:16.374
your attention gets engrossed in the lotus feet of Shiv Ji.

00:22:17.671 --> 00:22:20.584
And as soon as it gets engrossed in Shiv Ji's lotus feet,

00:22:21.735 --> 00:22:24.393
what happens is within you,

00:22:24.975 --> 00:22:29.939
whatever qualities aaaa of five elements are there,

00:22:30.275 --> 00:22:32.369
they also become very subtle.

00:22:33.354 --> 00:22:36.806
Already, I have told you about the four elements,

00:22:37.118 --> 00:22:40.594
but the fifth one, which is called ‘Ether’ in English,

00:22:40.795 --> 00:22:43.495
I didn’t tell about that, here it is called akash tatva.

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:49.209
Akash tatva is that, when a seeker attains the subtle state,

00:22:50.181 --> 00:22:53.377
then he attains the Subtlety of Ether element.

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:58.657
That akash which is etherial, that akash,

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:04.980
need not be activated also.

00:23:05.923 --> 00:23:11.093
If a person has any problem or any trouble,

00:23:11.268 --> 00:23:13.061
then through this all pervading power,

00:23:13.538 --> 00:23:19.781
of akash tatva, which is omnipresent,

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:25.580
Your attention immediately reaches, where it is required.

00:23:26.089 --> 00:23:29.651
It is an amazing thing, but it happens and happened also.

00:23:29.913 --> 00:23:33.548
people may call it miracle, but it is not so.

00:23:33.865 --> 00:23:37.865
In Sahaja Yoga if your Shiva tatva is awakened,

00:23:38.234 --> 00:23:40.996
then all the subtle qualities,

00:23:41.274 --> 00:23:43.980
the subtlest of the subtle quality,

00:23:45.488 --> 00:23:49.716
the emotions and the state within you gets awakened.

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:54.057
Therefore it is necessary for us to, first of all  purify our heart.

00:23:55.478 --> 00:23:59.732
Now, so far I have talked to you, about three enemies.

00:24:00.313 --> 00:24:03.979
Now, the fourth enemy present within us is madha.

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.384
Madha means "Ego".

00:24:09.473 --> 00:24:14.442
When this ego effects women, they start walking like men.

00:24:16.101 --> 00:24:18.402
Then they cannot walk like women because of the pride.

00:24:19.133 --> 00:24:21.474
"I am something very special" kind of feeling.

00:24:21.712 --> 00:24:27.724
supposing a girl  either comes from a very rich family,

00:24:27.939 --> 00:24:29.843
or she is very beautiful,

00:24:30.161 --> 00:24:32.886
or very well educated, what ever the reason be,

00:24:33.268 --> 00:24:35.434
if she gets effected by ego,

00:24:36.712 --> 00:24:40.354
then woman, starts walking like a man.

00:24:42.118 --> 00:24:46.643
And when a man is effected by ego, he starts walking like a woman.

00:24:48.319 --> 00:24:50.657
Meaning, such a man makes himself up,

00:24:51.086 --> 00:24:55.847
for hours sits before the mirror, combs his hair, does this and that

00:24:56.173 --> 00:24:58.048
does all kinds of feminine actions.

00:24:59.826 --> 00:25:01.548
To dress up is the job of the woman.

00:25:01.715 --> 00:25:03.603
while walking also he doesn't walk straight.

00:25:03.804 --> 00:25:05.522
He walks in a peculier fashion.

00:25:05.948 --> 00:25:07.272
From behind, if you see him, you will feel as if

00:25:07.473 --> 00:25:10.729
a lady is walking in a male dress,

00:25:13.005 --> 00:25:15.164
So, when,

00:25:15.819 --> 00:25:20.988
a man gets intoxicated with this , ego, (madha)

00:25:21.794 --> 00:25:23.516
then he is in his own world.

00:25:24.213 --> 00:25:27.449
And he starts swaying like an intoxicated elephant

00:25:28.816 --> 00:25:31.126
All their activities are different and prominent.

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:35.649
Whether they talk, or they don't talk, or how they sit

00:25:36.158 --> 00:25:38.851
in every action it is apparent that,

00:25:39.113 --> 00:25:41.337
they have some kind of ego within them.

00:25:41.907 --> 00:25:44.991
It is difficult to understand the cause of their ego.

00:25:45.595 --> 00:25:47.919
what makes them think that they are special.

00:25:48.222 --> 00:25:50.427
All these things are insignificant.

00:25:51.388 --> 00:25:53.173
It has no meaning at all.

00:25:53.561 --> 00:25:56.150
In Sahaja they have no meaning at all.

00:25:56.784 --> 00:25:58.847
And so that is why (laughs)

00:25:59.288 --> 00:26:01.571
to believe in the kind of things,

00:26:01.801 --> 00:26:05.848
that "we are something special", then you just end up to be nothing.

00:26:06.865 --> 00:26:09.039
You do not remain to be special, you are nothing.

00:26:09.239 --> 00:26:13.517
It means, its not wise to have any imagination about self

00:26:14.251 --> 00:26:16.878
that I am very rich or I am something great.

00:26:17.079 --> 00:26:19.737
Now even the poor people suffer from ego element;

00:26:20.571 --> 00:26:23.618
Even the dalits are becoming egoistic, Its beyond understanding:

00:26:24.096 --> 00:26:27.825
They talk as if they are something very great.

00:26:28.302 --> 00:26:30.309
What are you as an individual?

00:26:30.746 --> 00:26:33.375
A devotee of God Almighty.

00:26:34.828 --> 00:26:37.899
You are Sahaja Yogis, who believe in God.

00:26:39.587 --> 00:26:42.740
To think about yourself like that,

00:26:43.225 --> 00:26:45.121
is to go away from the state of joy, (anand).

00:26:45.574 --> 00:26:48.944
because the power of Shiva takes the seeker to the state of joy.

00:26:49.627 --> 00:26:53.222
To get engrossed in the state of joy, a man

00:26:53.619 --> 00:26:55.031
worships Lord Shiva.

00:26:55.281 --> 00:26:57.930
But I have seen that most of the Shiva bhaktas

00:26:58.279 --> 00:27:01.311
are filthy type of people, no one can dare to talk to them.

00:27:01.856 --> 00:27:02.824
What is the use?

00:27:03.007 --> 00:27:05.804
Because the are woeshipping Sakshat Natraj,

00:27:06.178 --> 00:27:09.796
from whom emanates all form of arts,

00:27:10.106 --> 00:27:14.462
extremely joyful and embodiment of permanent joy,

00:27:14.966 --> 00:27:18.629
before Him, how could these pseudo devotees be called His bhaktas?

00:27:19.025 --> 00:27:21.303
They hang such a big linga in their neck,

00:27:21.517 --> 00:27:23.144
that could give heart attack.

00:27:23.557 --> 00:27:24.676
What is the need for that?

00:27:24.877 --> 00:27:27.248
You are yourself the sakshat linga swarupa.

00:27:27.668 --> 00:27:32.272
Without becoming that, they, who are worshipping Shiva claim that,

00:27:33.042 --> 00:27:34.050
"we are Shiva Bhaktas".

00:27:34.201 --> 00:27:36.121
They do Shiva bhakti and also fight.

00:27:36.558 --> 00:27:38.708
And for this they have different marks.

00:27:39.085 --> 00:27:42.021
Shiva bhaktas will use sandal pwder across the forehead,

00:27:42.466 --> 00:27:45.488
and Vishnu bhaktas will use the same along the forehead.

00:27:46.076 --> 00:27:48.980
dear brother! what does this mean?

00:27:49.457 --> 00:27:52.567
Vertical application on means that we are ascending. Alright,

00:27:52.901 --> 00:27:55.192
if you are ascending spiritually,

00:27:55.393 --> 00:27:57.799
then after ascending you should be peaceful.

00:27:58.924 --> 00:28:02.003
It should be applied both ways, or don't apply at all.

00:28:02.583 --> 00:28:04.464
It should have some meaning,

00:28:04.671 --> 00:28:07.237
that whatever we are trying to achieve,

00:28:07.526 --> 00:28:09.674
should be through this central path.

00:28:09.873 --> 00:28:11.539
While passing through this way,

00:28:11.761 --> 00:28:14.563
you have to leave behind all the negativities.

00:28:16.479 --> 00:28:20.178
Before criticizing others, learn to criticize yourself.

00:28:22.031 --> 00:28:24.895
"I am like this, I am like that", say it to yourself,

00:28:26.038 --> 00:28:28.800
when you start critisizing yourself, then you will see that

00:28:29.001 --> 00:28:30.875
all the bhoots (evil spirits) will run away.

00:28:31.113 --> 00:28:33.589
Because we have gathered all these negativities.

00:28:33.819 --> 00:28:36.835
by our continuous thought process, by our Agnya;

00:28:37.296 --> 00:28:40.964
The excessive use of Agnya, started accumalating negative forces,

00:28:41.186 --> 00:28:42.527
every thing became mental projection,

00:28:42.728 --> 00:28:46.789
and such a person becomes very troublesome and miserable.

00:28:47.447 --> 00:28:50.312
And that misary makes him also miserable.

00:28:51.225 --> 00:28:54.122
By giving unhappiness to others, you can never be happy.

00:28:54.417 --> 00:28:57.084
It will have its impact on you even if you are a stone.

00:28:57.323 --> 00:28:59.156
It will have its impact

00:28:59.616 --> 00:29:02.473
and the impact is such that, the person becomes miserable.

00:29:06.013 --> 00:29:10.291
As far as a mother is concerned, she always thinks of your welfare.

00:29:11.314 --> 00:29:13.631
She thinks of the things which can give you comfort,

00:29:14.307 --> 00:29:18.234
give you contentment and give you peace of mind.

00:29:18.754 --> 00:29:20.373
Which can give you love,

00:29:20.796 --> 00:29:23.621
and you become a saintly person in this world.

00:29:24.365 --> 00:29:26.130
This is the method of the Mother.

00:29:26.416 --> 00:29:28.336
But this is not Lord Shiva's method.

00:29:28.821 --> 00:29:32.051
He tolerates upto a certain limit and then deals so severely

00:29:32.202 --> 00:29:36.598
that I get terrified that what is going to happen to this person.

00:29:36.885 --> 00:29:39.570
Where shall he reach? What is He doing?

00:29:39.733 --> 00:29:41.073
He doesn't think that.

00:29:41.563 --> 00:29:45.195
It is not within His nature to think that,

00:29:45.425 --> 00:29:51.014
what if he is very bad and very evil, let me forgive him.

00:29:51.141 --> 00:29:54.943
Yes, if the person is worthy of His forgiveness, then He forgives.

00:29:55.134 --> 00:29:58.045
And those who meditate upon Him continuously,

00:29:58.276 --> 00:30:00.241
He blesses them with boons.

00:30:01.006 --> 00:30:02.926
But that person who,

00:30:04.806 --> 00:30:06.606
basically,

00:30:06.892 --> 00:30:10.316
does not want to rectify himself, Lord Shiva sets him right.

00:30:10.581 --> 00:30:11.727
This is true.

00:30:11.919 --> 00:30:13.350
That’s why we should be scared of Him.

00:30:13.501 --> 00:30:15.160
that is why He is called Bhayankar.

00:30:15.362 --> 00:30:18.941
When He gets angry, He does not forgive anyone.

00:30:19.478 --> 00:30:24.226
But His worst anger comes, during the time of doomsday,

00:30:24.591 --> 00:30:27.041
what we call as "A night will come,

00:30:27.242 --> 00:30:28.883
when the whole creation will come to an end".

00:30:29.042 --> 00:30:32.243
At that time He will destroy everything with his anger.

00:30:32.949 --> 00:30:38.894
This time comes, as I have told you, at the time of last judgement.

00:30:39.282 --> 00:30:43.107
In this, which path you take to, where you go,

00:30:43.375 --> 00:30:48.125
whatever you are doing, all these things are completely.

00:30:49.397 --> 00:30:50.746
stored within you.

00:30:52.135 --> 00:30:54.252
Every small detail about you,

00:30:55.134 --> 00:30:59.943
accordingly sends you either to heaven or to hell.

00:31:00.892 --> 00:31:04.508
It is Lord Shiva who sends people to hell; I do not do that.

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:06.826
I have nothing to do with (Narka) Hell.

00:31:06.977 --> 00:31:08.548
But Lord Shiva has

00:31:08.747 --> 00:31:11.598
He will pull you by your legs and throw you in the hell.

00:31:12.042 --> 00:31:16.439
Then you can not say that I am the worshipper of the Mother,

00:31:16.582 --> 00:31:21.125
and I am the follower of mother, then why is this happening to me?

00:31:22.391 --> 00:31:24.196
I am not instrumental in it.

00:31:24.742 --> 00:31:29.081
Once some one calls me Mother, then I can not think ill of him.

00:31:29.518 --> 00:31:30.311
But,

00:31:31.057 --> 00:31:34.683
If I am the dignity (Maryadas) for Shiva then He is my dignity too.

00:31:35.374 --> 00:31:39.849
But, in this regard since we both are totally opposite in nature,

00:31:40.095 --> 00:31:42.230
you have to be very careful.

00:31:44.233 --> 00:31:48.319
And, the eleven Rudras present in Jesus Christ also is HIM (Shiv ji)

00:31:48.822 --> 00:31:52.393
The emotions of the Rudras are the form of Lord Shiva.

00:31:52.664 --> 00:31:56.020
that is why, you have to be very careful.

00:31:58.122 --> 00:32:01.288
regarding this I have to warn you because,

00:32:01.558 --> 00:32:05.207
even in Sahaja Yoga some people come to earn money,

00:32:05.408 --> 00:32:08.596
some talk ill of others, some do wrong things,

00:32:08.763 --> 00:32:10.604
some do injustice,

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:13.825
Such persons are sieved out of the stream,

00:32:14.024 --> 00:32:17.444
But as soon as they are out, they get into the orbit of Lord Shiva.

00:32:17.801 --> 00:32:20.209
Then I get the news that, they have gone bankrupt,

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:23.828
this has happened, that has happened, I say now don't tell me this.

00:32:24.511 --> 00:32:28.847
Now he himself has out of his protection, then who could save him?

00:32:29.808 --> 00:32:34.879
So, you should try to seek your protection in Lord Shiva.

00:32:36.042 --> 00:32:37.891
Of course, you are protected by the Mother,

00:32:38.098 --> 00:32:39.970
But you should seek Lord Shiva's protection,

00:32:40.185 --> 00:32:44.502
For that, I told you about the five things now.

00:32:44.879 --> 00:32:49.813
The subtlity of these five element, should be attained by you.

00:32:50.181 --> 00:32:56.321
And to achieve that State, its necessary to meditate regularly.

00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:00.297
Those who meditate, look totally different

00:33:00.797 --> 00:33:03.709
And those who do not meditate look different,

00:33:04.529 --> 00:33:05.901
there is no doubt about it.

00:33:06.338 --> 00:33:09.429
Now those who meditate but they are not willing to do so,

00:33:09.754 --> 00:33:11.333
Whose attention is not there in meditation,

00:33:11.534 --> 00:33:14.889
those who do not have understanding or expertise for meditation,

00:33:15.143 --> 00:33:16.706
and towards that,

00:33:17.346 --> 00:33:19.552
there is a kind of lazyness, then

00:33:20.108 --> 00:33:22.211
that meditation is not successful.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:24.524
there is no benefit in that.

00:33:25.167 --> 00:33:30.556
Meditation should be such that, each and every cell of your body,

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:35.146
gets filled with joy, and happiness pours out of them.

00:33:35.583 --> 00:33:38.099
Lord Shiva's first and,

00:33:38.814 --> 00:33:43.768
most important blessings is that,

00:33:44.038 --> 00:33:47.585
he gives you Joy, fills your being with happiness.

00:33:49.302 --> 00:33:54.318
just by chanting his name, a person,

00:33:54.667 --> 00:33:56.143
should become joyous.

00:33:56.808 --> 00:34:00.260
But instead people always behave opposite to it.

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:05.449
Whatever is expected does not happen, this makes me feel surprised,

00:34:06.109 --> 00:34:09.981
that the people whom we think to be Shiva bhaktas (devotees),

00:34:10.225 --> 00:34:14.599
how could they be so dry personalities? Not possible at all..

00:34:15.966 --> 00:34:17.942
There is one more reason for it.

00:34:18.403 --> 00:34:22.633
Those who are busy working always, too busy,

00:34:23.959 --> 00:34:25.577
they become right sided.

00:34:26.493 --> 00:34:30.351
When they become right sided, they get disconnected from Lord Shiva

00:34:31.629 --> 00:34:33.470
They move away from Lord Shiva.

00:34:33.717 --> 00:34:36.756
and then Shiva shows His powers.

00:34:37.785 --> 00:34:41.047
Now You know that goddess Saraswati is the sister of Lord Shiva.

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:43.347
The worshippers of Saraswati,

00:34:43.549 --> 00:34:48.832
meaning, the people who read and write, who gather knowledge,

00:34:49.076 --> 00:34:55.100
and apart from that, who are interested in art,

00:34:55.481 --> 00:34:57.140
who are genuine art lovers,

00:34:57.576 --> 00:35:02.110
this kind of people who worship Shri Saraswti, pay homage to her,

00:35:02.286 --> 00:35:06.420
they should know first of all that She is Shiv Ji's sister

00:35:06.976 --> 00:35:09.920
and you know that sister's relationship is amazing.

00:35:10.888 --> 00:35:15.373
If you try to insult His sister,

00:35:15.668 --> 00:35:19.516
adopt any bad qualities or talk ill of Her,

00:35:19.906 --> 00:35:22.847
for example many people write impure literature or bad books,

00:35:23.435 --> 00:35:27.435
many people have knowledge, but they misuse it,

00:35:27.753 --> 00:35:31.550
this kind of people can not escape the wrath of Shiv Ji.

00:35:32.114 --> 00:35:35.047
Because His sister is very important to Him.

00:35:35.926 --> 00:35:39.826
And to insult Her is like greatest sin on earth.

00:35:40.144 --> 00:35:42.468
In His view, it is a very big sin.

00:35:42.863 --> 00:35:45.101
And for Adi Shakti also His protocols,

00:35:47.635 --> 00:35:51.170
are equally rigid, there is no doubt about that.

00:35:51.297 --> 00:35:55.781
(please check this, it is falling off, now it is alright)

00:35:56.632 --> 00:35:57.632
And now,

00:35:58.974 --> 00:36:03.223
Sahaja Yogis, first of all have to pay attention towards themselves.

00:36:04.598 --> 00:36:07.479
I do not mean that they should sit before the mirror for hours .

00:36:07.636 --> 00:36:08.485
Not at all.

00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:12.255
sitting before the mirror always also is considered to be a disease.

00:36:12.987 --> 00:36:16.859
I mean to say that you should have attention towards your ‘self’.

00:36:17.393 --> 00:36:22.201
look at yourself and see" what are the problems within me"?

00:36:23.226 --> 00:36:25.408
“What wrong things am I doing?”

00:36:26.346 --> 00:36:29.194
In our Indian culture, (caughs)

00:36:29.444 --> 00:36:32.888
the straight path, which has been suggested, should be taken,

00:36:33.563 --> 00:36:35.689
Now a days, new Era has come,

00:36:35.983 --> 00:36:38.696
so, people think they can live as they want, but it is not so.

00:36:40.666 --> 00:36:42.296
Being in India,

00:36:42.518 --> 00:36:46.457
you have to be totally according to the Indian culture,

00:36:46.971 --> 00:36:52.826
Your life style should remain connected to lndian culture, because,

00:36:53.263 --> 00:36:56.398
in Indian culture, great importance is given to Shiva Tattva.

00:36:56.856 --> 00:36:59.195
Most important of all is Shiva Tatva.

00:36:59.576 --> 00:37:03.465
And Shiva Tattva only has created our boundries of good conduct.

00:37:04.113 --> 00:37:07.480
The moment you cross these maryadas, you are finished.

00:37:08.925 --> 00:37:11.837
All these rnaryadas which are in our culture

00:37:12.038 --> 00:37:14.297
are because of the grace of Lord Shiva.

00:37:15.309 --> 00:37:20.634
Whatever has been told to us so far, don't do this, don't do that,

00:37:20.952 --> 00:37:22.651
everything big and small,

00:37:23.048 --> 00:37:25.703
maryadas (boundreis) has been laid by Lord Shiva.

00:37:26.108 --> 00:37:29.775
He is so much concerned about His maryadas that,

00:37:30.307 --> 00:37:34.529
The moment you step over these boundries,

00:37:34.815 --> 00:37:36.910
you get affected by them.

00:37:38.274 --> 00:37:39.877
Now, in the name of Shiva Tattva,

00:37:40.078 --> 00:37:42.932
People have created so many wrong ideas.

00:37:43.536 --> 00:37:46.806
Like, many people think that by taking Bhang (an intoxicating drink)

00:37:47.091 --> 00:37:49.044
you can awaken Shiva Tatva.

00:37:49.692 --> 00:37:52.358
Many others who consume liquer think that,

00:37:52.684 --> 00:37:55.481
drinking of Alcohol submerges you in Shiva Tattva!

00:37:56.006 --> 00:37:59.815
Many wrong ideas of this type, has been created by people,

00:38:00.016 --> 00:38:02.270
that, this kind of act is alright for Shiv Ji.

00:38:02.952 --> 00:38:04.864
It is fine for Shiv Ji to do that.

00:38:05.618 --> 00:38:08.221
For that matter Shiv Ji drank poison also.

00:38:08.788 --> 00:38:10.470
Would you also drink poison?

00:38:11.272 --> 00:38:16.621
He drank poison to make the whole world free from it.

00:38:17.483 --> 00:38:20.982
that is why He used to eat Dhatura (moon flower),

00:38:21.308 --> 00:38:23.603
because dhatura contains poison.

00:38:24.706 --> 00:38:28.984
Similarly you might have heard that Sai Nath,

00:38:29.288 --> 00:38:30.629
used plenty of tobacco,

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:36.132
Aaaaaa! He used to fill it in a pipe and inhale the smoke.

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:40.466
Because, in Maharashtra people are addicted to tobacco, everybody.

00:38:40.867 --> 00:38:42.809
Minister also will consume tobacco and

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:45.200
his servant also will consume that.

00:38:45.375 --> 00:38:48.881
And minister will tell the servant, "give me tobacco if you have".

00:38:50.888 --> 00:38:54.999
To this extent there people are used to tobacco

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:58.586
Although this tobacco is not grown there. (in Maharashtra).

00:38:58.833 --> 00:39:01.690
But somehow they are crazy of tobacco.

00:39:02.182 --> 00:39:04.555
to great extent people consume tobacco in Maharashtra.

00:39:04.972 --> 00:39:08.083
To free people of this tobacco Sainath,

00:39:08.345 --> 00:39:12.545
thought," why don't I consume the whole tobacco".

00:39:12.944 --> 00:39:15.976
that is why He used to inhale Tobacco,

00:39:16.177 --> 00:39:17.163
But people started saying,

00:39:17.369 --> 00:39:19.865
"Sainath is taking tobacco, so we also can take it".

00:39:20.035 --> 00:39:24.416
Because of these kind of people, He used to consume tobacco

00:39:24.623 --> 00:39:28.689
so that the tobacco addiction of these people will come to an end.,

00:39:29.618 --> 00:39:33.618
Now, what ever you call it, tobacco is tobacco,

00:39:33.944 --> 00:39:37.772
Now, the connection between Lord Shiva and tobacco is not direct,

00:39:37.973 --> 00:39:40.036
but it is definite that

00:39:41.188 --> 00:39:45.172
He wanted to destroy the tobacco from the whole world.

00:39:45.681 --> 00:39:47.514
Now supposing you are the Goddess,

00:39:48.117 --> 00:39:52.422
so the job of the Goddess is to eat all the bhoots.

00:39:52.851 --> 00:39:54.731
would you also eat Bhoot?

00:39:56.081 --> 00:39:59.196
And it is the job of the Goddess is that,

00:39:59.387 --> 00:40:06.061
what ever deseases you are having, she absorbs all of them.

00:40:07.462 --> 00:40:09.398
So, Would you also do the same?

00:40:09.874 --> 00:40:11.350
This is not your job.

00:40:12.573 --> 00:40:16.884
Similarly, whatever saints and sages have done,

00:40:17.123 --> 00:40:22.408
you neither have the power to do any of that, nor it is your job.

00:40:22.957 --> 00:40:25.618
Your duty is to cleanse yourself,

00:40:26.052 --> 00:40:29.586
to correct yourself and first attain that state,

00:40:30.238 --> 00:40:32.180
then all other matters will be alright.

00:40:32.513 --> 00:40:36.022
But, if you don't reach that state, it is useless.

00:40:36.363 --> 00:40:39.372
All the rituals you are doing will be a waste.

00:40:40.135 --> 00:40:44.301
There are many things, for which the justification

00:40:45.238 --> 00:40:47.238
can be done in a wrong manner.

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:52.982
but if we go in the right direction, in right manner,

00:40:53.178 --> 00:40:56.557
then first of all we have to purify our hearts.

00:40:57.383 --> 00:40:59.526
All these habits, we are addicted to,

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:03.327
these habits also altogether

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:06.605
affect our heart.

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:10.279
So in the olden times, it so happened,

00:41:10.629 --> 00:41:14.919
that all the disciples who came were made to sleep  in jungles,

00:41:24.167 --> 00:41:28.714
They used to live in jungles among the snakes, scorpions

00:41:29.061 --> 00:41:31.545
cobwebs and other animals..

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:36.822
so that you do not get addicted to luxurious life.

00:41:38.457 --> 00:41:44.766
At the most they could sleep in huts, which was done with cow dung

00:41:45.323 --> 00:41:49.363
They used to live a very simple life, and wear minimum of clothes.

00:41:50.092 --> 00:41:53.762
so that they could not be crazy about clothes.

00:41:55.635 --> 00:41:58.791
"We want to wear theses cloths, we want this shoes,

00:41:58.942 --> 00:42:03.045
we want this food", Sahajayogis should not say all this.

00:42:03.663 --> 00:42:06.055
You know that your Mother could live anywhere,

00:42:06.386 --> 00:42:08.626
could sleep anywhere; could eat any food.

00:42:09.079 --> 00:42:11.420
So this taste bud within us,

00:42:12.452 --> 00:42:17.907
In our country, all the Indians are very fond of eating.

00:42:18.754 --> 00:42:22.393
Sahaja Yogis also invite each other for dinner and lunch.

00:42:24.284 --> 00:42:27.085
Ladies, in perticularly have that thing to say,

00:42:27.284 --> 00:42:29.587
when I go somewhere "mother, come to our house for a meal".

00:42:29.788 --> 00:42:32.558
I say, its difficult for me to go and eat anywhere.

00:42:32.875 --> 00:42:36.280
I can not eat in a hotel, I can not eat anywhere

00:42:36.852 --> 00:42:40.671
Even in my own house I eat without salt and sugar.

00:42:41.829 --> 00:42:44.623
My taste buds are like that from my childhood.

00:42:45.149 --> 00:42:47.133
Whatever is available I eat that.

00:42:47.403 --> 00:42:51.553
But our tongue is used to spicy and tangy tastes, all Indians.

00:42:52.041 --> 00:42:58.251
Whether they are from from U.P., from Punjab or from South

00:42:58.426 --> 00:43:02.564
In the matter of eating, Indians are great experts.

00:43:03.445 --> 00:43:06.651
They befool men by serving them good food.

00:43:09.124 --> 00:43:14.631
"My husband is fond of this food, my husband is fond of that food"

00:43:14.917 --> 00:43:15.893
What to do?

00:43:16.084 --> 00:43:19.383
Women will be slaves to their husband and try to please them.

00:43:19.629 --> 00:43:21.962
If day and night they keep talking about food,

00:43:22.163 --> 00:43:23.789
then they are not Sahaja Yogis

00:43:25.782 --> 00:43:28.821
And when I was there in Milan

00:43:29.504 --> 00:43:33.693
There during the program of Guru puja, I myself cooked food.

00:43:33.884 --> 00:43:34.780
What to do?

00:43:35.074 --> 00:43:37.510
For four years I myself cooked there,

00:43:37.773 --> 00:43:40.153
because no one else could prepare tasty food.

00:43:40.579 --> 00:43:43.083
People would say "Mother, it tastes just like plastic".

00:43:43.298 --> 00:43:45.408
In perticular all Indians.

00:43:45.783 --> 00:43:48.870
All the Indians who come their for Puja, have to meet me.

00:43:49.053 --> 00:43:50.950
as if they have special right over me.

00:43:51.133 --> 00:43:53.312
Also they are very critical of the food,

00:43:54.045 --> 00:43:55.672
that the food served here is not good.

00:43:55.855 --> 00:43:58.976
Now one more new thing has begun among Indians,

00:43:59.405 --> 00:44:01.476
that they want attached bath.

00:44:03.828 --> 00:44:07.228
Their bathrooms, if you go to their houses and see,

00:44:07.449 --> 00:44:09.036
how their parents lived there.

00:44:09.322 --> 00:44:12.877
Now, they want attaced bath, that too of the western style.

00:44:13.525 --> 00:44:16.771
I am mentioning this today, because I am tired of it.

00:44:17.629 --> 00:44:22.067
In Ganapatipule, I provided Western bathrooms for the foreigners.

00:44:23.703 --> 00:44:25.314
At first I provided Indian toilets,

00:44:25.515 --> 00:44:28.448
thinking that Indians will like Indian style.

00:44:29.211 --> 00:44:31.678
And provided English people with western style.

00:44:32.076 --> 00:44:34.599
But Indian also demanded western bathrooms.

00:44:35.012 --> 00:44:35.972
Now what is this?

00:44:36.243 --> 00:44:38.925
I said now a strike is going to start here.

00:44:39.679 --> 00:44:43.984
I said, take tumblers and go to jungle, that is what you deserve.

00:44:44.952 --> 00:44:47.492
For years together that is how they have been going,

00:44:47.659 --> 00:44:51.579
But now they have become big Sahibs, they want attached bathrooms.

00:44:53.115 --> 00:44:55.289
The poor English people,

00:44:55.734 --> 00:44:57.924
poor foreigners who had come from abroad said,

00:44:58.125 --> 00:45:00.125
mother! we prefer Indian style.

00:45:00.387 --> 00:45:03.713
Because they are very clean, so give us Indian bathrooms only.

00:45:03.944 --> 00:45:05.308
Then I changed the arrangement

00:45:05.509 --> 00:45:09.237
and Indians were very happy that they got attached bathrooms.

00:45:10.495 --> 00:45:12.320
You should be ashamed of it.

00:45:12.987 --> 00:45:15.979
Sahaja Yogis, talking about such things should be ashamed.

00:45:16.413 --> 00:45:18.586
Your forefathers used to go to jungle with tumblers

00:45:18.787 --> 00:45:20.157
and why do you have this new hobby?

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:23.229
Have you got some disease or any other problem?

00:45:24.273 --> 00:45:26.018
They put me in great trouble.

00:45:26.154 --> 00:45:28.304
But somehow it struck me that

00:45:28.505 --> 00:45:30.822
"okay you take this and you take that"

00:45:34.701 --> 00:45:37.294
This kind of giving excuses and this kind of work,

00:45:37.495 --> 00:45:39.106
is typical nature of an Indian.

00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:43.088
You will be surprised, people who come to Cabella,

00:45:43.486 --> 00:45:45.556
all of them stay with one another,

00:45:45.676 --> 00:45:48.912
though they are very rich people, they have cars and everything,

00:45:49.113 --> 00:45:50.888
still they would sleep in the pendal,

00:45:51.089 --> 00:45:54.412
but Indians will have a special place for themselves,

00:45:54.918 --> 00:45:57.191
they will stay in hotels and roam around in cars,

00:45:57.468 --> 00:45:59.865
They do not have, even to a small extent,

00:46:00.087 --> 00:46:02.740
any kind of sacrificing attitude.

00:46:04.689 --> 00:46:06.927
They have not learnt how to sacrifice

00:46:07.134 --> 00:46:09.935
this modernism is beyond me to understand.

00:46:12.262 --> 00:46:14.872
Now, there are no servants in their houses.

00:46:16.135 --> 00:46:17.769
So, they have no attached bath,

00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:20.794
they have only one bathroom, because they only have to clean it.

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:24.897
You all have servants, so you can afford even ten-ten bathrooms.

00:46:25.999 --> 00:46:29.477
But all these things are taking you away

00:46:29.678 --> 00:46:31.295
from your own powers.

00:46:31.967 --> 00:46:34.244
Your attention is going in useless things.

00:46:35.024 --> 00:46:37.248
Frittering away of the attention in absurdities,

00:46:37.934 --> 00:46:44.012
all these will make you a very ordinary human being.

00:46:45.001 --> 00:46:48.536
Among women, it is fashion now-a-days to go to beaty parlours.

00:46:48.905 --> 00:46:50.390
their face will remain the same.

00:46:50.593 --> 00:46:53.781
They will spend money there, do this here and do that there.

00:46:54.047 --> 00:46:56.507
In Pune, wife of Brahmins

00:46:57.081 --> 00:47:00.287
will wear sleeveless dresses, use eye goggles,

00:47:01.117 --> 00:47:03.070
And roam around in a moped,

00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:05.217
not understandable.

00:47:07.249 --> 00:47:09.385
In Pune, which is punya-pattanam (land of good deeds).

00:47:09.616 --> 00:47:11.621
Is this the way to do good deeds?

00:47:13.115 --> 00:47:16.200
This is how we are adopting western system,

00:47:16.359 --> 00:47:19.743
without thinking, where is Shiva Tatva in this?

00:47:21.954 --> 00:47:23.390
Look at Shri Shiva,

00:47:24.208 --> 00:47:25.541
He is sitting with minimum of clothes.

00:47:25.709 --> 00:47:28.914
In His marriage procession also He sat upon Nandi and went.

00:47:29.804 --> 00:47:33.051
Why Nandi? Because Nandi is His disciple.

00:47:33.766 --> 00:47:36.123
Whatever He says, Nandi will nod his head

00:47:36.639 --> 00:47:39.690
He can tell Nandi anything, that's why Nandi is His dearest

00:47:40.627 --> 00:47:41.317
desciple.

00:47:41.627 --> 00:47:45.798
Now, He sat upon Nandi and arrived at His wedding venue

00:47:46.899 --> 00:47:48.724
So, Parvati Ji had no objection,

00:47:48.867 --> 00:47:51.430
but Her brother Vishnu Ji was little worried that,

00:47:51.631 --> 00:47:54.501
Why the bridegroom is coming in this manner?

00:47:55.568 --> 00:47:58.467
I do not mean that you become this kind of a groom,

00:47:59.349 --> 00:48:04.380
I dont mean that, but, still to overdo things of the whole world

00:48:04.614 --> 00:48:07.764
and spending unnecessarily is of no use.

00:48:09.514 --> 00:48:11.053
Be sensible.

00:48:11.654 --> 00:48:13.812
sensibility is your ornament.

00:48:15.011 --> 00:48:18.185
To accept every thing, whatever is available, is alright

00:48:18.669 --> 00:48:19.817
Food- alright.

00:48:20.047 --> 00:48:21.896
Now, they will go to someone's house for food

00:48:22.237 --> 00:48:23.888
and keep critisizing the host.

00:48:25.301 --> 00:48:26.851
may not be on their face but will come home and say

00:48:27.148 --> 00:48:28.875
" what kind of food was that?",

00:48:29.076 --> 00:48:30.649
If someone has cooked good food, still they will say,

00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:32.902
"you also cook the same way".

00:48:34.939 --> 00:48:38.391
The whole day attention on taste of the tongue is,

00:48:38.598 --> 00:48:41.542
too much in India, beyond the limit.

00:48:43.108 --> 00:48:44.877
And this should be reduced a bit.

00:48:45.338 --> 00:48:47.131
These people (foreign Yogis) eat your Indian food,

00:48:47.332 --> 00:48:49.441
I have never heard any complaint.

00:48:50.624 --> 00:48:54.330
Although, you can never eat their Western food.

00:48:59.991 --> 00:49:03.585
But the way you have coated your whole self,

00:49:05.028 --> 00:49:07.558
will not let you get into the deeper jpy.

00:49:08.654 --> 00:49:10.444
The joy of Lord Shiva,

00:49:11.476 --> 00:49:15.371
to achieve that, People had told,

00:49:15.677 --> 00:49:18.653
that you renounce every thing, first renounce the world

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:21.407
Go to Himalyas and stand on one leg.

00:49:22.058 --> 00:49:23.970
Wear minimum of clothes.

00:49:24.902 --> 00:49:28.751
Take a dip in the river and then meditate with wet clothes.

00:49:29.549 --> 00:49:31.279
they used to torture the body.

00:49:31.509 --> 00:49:33.993
Even these days Gurus beat their disciples.

00:49:34.741 --> 00:49:38.708
They trouble a lot, realisation is not given so easily, no way.

00:49:39.708 --> 00:49:44.771
After giving all the trouble, then the desciples get realization.

00:49:45.473 --> 00:49:48.923
but their realization establishes them.

00:49:49.948 --> 00:49:50.868
strongly.

00:49:51.248 --> 00:49:53.561
But you all have realization just like that

00:49:53.762 --> 00:49:56.864
and your previous habits are still linger on.

00:49:59.133 --> 00:50:02.294
THese problems are still with you, now what tod o with them?

00:50:02.811 --> 00:50:04.532
they need to be shaken off you.

00:50:04.747 --> 00:50:06.937
All these things which we have accumalated

00:50:07.138 --> 00:50:09.040
need to be pushed away, totally finished.

00:50:09.318 --> 00:50:11.183
And for that there is no need to make a show,

00:50:11.384 --> 00:50:14.889
renounce the world or leave the home and family.

00:50:15.322 --> 00:50:16.726
Any kind of,

00:50:18.222 --> 00:50:20.869
Dravidi Pranyamas (holding the breath) are not required.

00:50:21.174 --> 00:50:23.877
But one thing is a must,

00:50:25.608 --> 00:50:27.465
your temptation of the taste buds,

00:50:28.187 --> 00:50:30.584
should be reduced slowly.

00:50:31.599 --> 00:50:33.676
Tastelessness should come inside you.

00:50:34.137 --> 00:50:35.327
it is very important.

00:50:35.716 --> 00:50:38.779
tasteleness of the tongue is a great quality.

00:50:39.007 --> 00:50:42.446
People get enraged if they do not get food of their own choice.

00:50:42.637 --> 00:50:47.731
They throw away their plates, beat their servants and what not?

00:50:48.681 --> 00:50:51.109
If you can conquer your taste buds,

00:50:53.673 --> 00:50:57.918
then many sweet shops will close down, in my openiun (laughs).

00:50:58.545 --> 00:50:59.680
However,

00:51:01.267 --> 00:51:02.957
I mean to say that,

00:51:03.142 --> 00:51:05.632
the body should not be given much importance.

00:51:06.625 --> 00:51:08.307
If the body is given the comfort

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:11.886
and supposing you sleep on a cot, you can't sleep on the ground.

00:51:12.165 --> 00:51:14.136
then for ten days sleep on the ground.

00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:15.810
How can you not sleep like that?

00:51:16.033 --> 00:51:19.358
Without enslaving your body, you cannot achieve anything.

00:51:19.707 --> 00:51:22.926
The talk about your comfort should come to an end.

00:51:23.149 --> 00:51:26.458
Many people are there who can not travel by bus.

00:51:27.489 --> 00:51:30.818
Because they want to go by car.

00:51:31.477 --> 00:51:35.334
Then borrow car from here, from there, sit in this car, that car

00:51:35.993 --> 00:51:37.760
But none of them will think

00:51:37.961 --> 00:51:40.966
"come, let me travel by bus today and see what happens?

00:51:41.981 --> 00:51:44.474
And earlier there were no buses also, people used to walk

00:51:44.823 --> 00:51:47.538
When we were in school, we used to walk five miles daily,

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:49.991
though we had car and everything.

00:51:51.767 --> 00:51:54.314
Such were the parents of mine.

00:51:54.977 --> 00:51:57.731
But we were very fond of walking bare foot,,

00:51:57.890 --> 00:52:00.557
And without shoes, carry slippers in hand.

00:52:02.134 --> 00:52:05.316
Because of the vibrations it felt good to walk on the earth.

00:52:05.642 --> 00:52:06.738
You should also

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:09.946
make the habit of walking without shoes and slippers.

00:52:10.788 --> 00:52:13.010
It is very important and very beneficiary.

00:52:13.309 --> 00:52:16.583
Mother earth will have your vibration and you wil alsol feel nice.

00:52:17.067 --> 00:52:21.591
In every field we have become too much of comfort loving people.

00:52:22.586 --> 00:52:25.768
We have become Just like few Nawabs of earlier days.

00:52:26.713 --> 00:52:29.141
And what did they get? we can get nothing from that.

00:52:29.308 --> 00:52:32.713
our lives whole will be wasted by becoming slaves to eaeryone.

00:52:32.871 --> 00:52:34.640
we have to reduce this slavery,

00:52:34.807 --> 00:52:38.696
and establish within us the essence (tatva) of Param Shiva.

00:52:39.517 --> 00:52:43.588
And for that it is essential that nothing else is important

00:52:44.224 --> 00:52:47.052
Today dress-up like this, tomorrow wear that dress,

00:52:47.251 --> 00:52:50.171
and with that this should match and this and so on.

00:52:50.584 --> 00:52:52.433
Whatever is available accept.

00:52:53.124 --> 00:52:55.460
Whatever comes your way wear that.

00:52:56.056 --> 00:52:59.722
It is alright, You will not be in any trouble because of that.

00:53:00.103 --> 00:53:03.584
On the contrary you will be happy that you are a contented person.

00:53:04.354 --> 00:53:07.798
Whatever I got, I have accepted wholeheartedly.

00:53:08.679 --> 00:53:10.793
Now a days, in our Nagpur,

00:53:10.992 --> 00:53:13.444
I don't know if the situatoin is same here also,

00:53:13.770 --> 00:53:17.039
the cost of the gas sylinder has gone up by 16 RS.

00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:20.018
The photos of the women who opposed this came in the paper,

00:53:20.201 --> 00:53:21.764
all well dressed and made-up.

00:53:22.018 --> 00:53:25.383
I said that their powder iyself must be worth Rupees fifteen.

00:53:30.758 --> 00:53:35.375
Why should these kind of people go on a strike, for name's sake.

00:53:35.765 --> 00:53:36.725
What for?

00:53:36.963 --> 00:53:38.439
Because of the increase by 15 Rs.

00:53:38.558 --> 00:53:41.958
Can't they see that their salary also has increased.

00:53:43.554 --> 00:53:48.141
Earlier, Supposing, we were paying Rupees 20-25 to our servants,

00:53:48.276 --> 00:53:50.236
Today we pay 2500 Rs.

00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:54.375
He also complains, though he gets clothes and other things also.

00:53:54.835 --> 00:53:58.804
salaries are increased so much, would not the prices increase?

00:53:59.336 --> 00:54:02.122
When the salary increases, costs also rise up.

00:54:02.696 --> 00:54:06.841
There is a story that in Sri Lanka, labors were given

00:54:07.016 --> 00:54:08.825
one gold brick a day.

00:54:09.399 --> 00:54:11.801
One person went to recieve gold bricks.

00:54:12.805 --> 00:54:15.322
He found that, after working for one day

00:54:15.576 --> 00:54:17.212
he recieved two glod bricks.

00:54:17.624 --> 00:54:20.996
after that he went to a barber shop for shave.

00:54:21.309 --> 00:54:25.124
He asked the barber “What are the charges?” “Two bricks”.

00:54:25.292 --> 00:54:27.299
As the income, so the expenses.

00:54:27.784 --> 00:54:29.109
It is a mtter of descretion.

00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:33.918
what is the point in grumbling over the price rise, this and that.

00:54:35.457 --> 00:54:39.438
How much your salary has risen? By a huge number.

00:54:40.236 --> 00:54:42.564
Then why to keep crying about the price rise?

00:54:42.826 --> 00:54:45.477
When the salary increases, price-hike has to happen.

00:54:45.683 --> 00:54:48.723
Your salary has increased and the prices to remain as it is?

00:54:49.186 --> 00:54:52.265
Its a very simple thing, if we learn this,

00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:55.917
then socially also we could achieve Shiv Tattva.

00:54:56.846 --> 00:54:59.576
Now, Gandhi Ji was an amazing person.

00:55:00.666 --> 00:55:03.875
I was with Him in his Ashram, nothing used to happen to me.

00:55:04.201 --> 00:55:05.566
But others used to cry.

00:55:05.812 --> 00:55:07.534
Because His policy was,

00:55:08.074 --> 00:55:11.627
AAAA! clean everyone's bathroom, everyone's,

00:55:11.961 --> 00:55:15.175
guest's and everyone's, there was no sweeper at all.

00:55:16.024 --> 00:55:17.460
(Shri Mataji laughing)

00:55:18.097 --> 00:55:21.030
Wash your own clothes, wash your own plates.

00:55:21.502 --> 00:55:26.124
And the meal consisted of boiled food with mustard oil on top of it.

00:55:27.029 --> 00:55:30.894
Now, tell me how many Indians can eat that type of food?

00:55:31.291 --> 00:55:34.086
People used to stay there for 2-3 days and then run away.

00:55:34.349 --> 00:55:35.275
This was the situation.

00:55:35.491 --> 00:55:38.975
Now, you people also should learn to controle your taste buds.

00:55:39.483 --> 00:55:41.617
Now, as far as tastelessness is concerned,

00:55:42.084 --> 00:55:44.131
I don't know how you can develop that,

00:55:44.362 --> 00:55:49.211
But you should eat only boiled food for a few days.

00:55:58.328 --> 00:56:00.652
No mother would say such a thing to her children,

00:56:00.867 --> 00:56:03.930
what do I do? It is damaging your Shiva Tattva in you.

00:56:04.194 --> 00:56:06.243
If all of your attention is in eating tasty food,

00:56:06.449 --> 00:56:08.028
then your Shiva Tattva will disappear

00:56:08.229 --> 00:56:10.465
and all the efforts taken will go a waste.

00:56:11.063 --> 00:56:15.151
So, to get engrossed too much in eating, is not so good.

00:56:16.858 --> 00:56:19.850
In olden days people used to observe fasts once a while,

00:56:20.178 --> 00:56:21.711
something or the other,

00:56:23.522 --> 00:56:25.212
They used to sacrifice.

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:28.288
But now a days it is very difficult to say,

00:56:28.518 --> 00:56:32.256
that if you become contented, become satisfied,

00:56:32.590 --> 00:56:36.021
then it is not necessary for you, absolutely not required,

00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:39.791
that all the time you talk about eating and drinking

00:56:39.982 --> 00:56:41.847
and invite others for supper.

00:56:42.233 --> 00:56:45.352
Then in India we have caste system.

00:56:46.002 --> 00:56:48.025
Kayasth are separate,

00:56:48.279 --> 00:56:52.334
Hindu brahmins are separate, and others are separate, even now.

00:56:53.361 --> 00:56:54.321
Now what has happened,

00:56:54.641 --> 00:56:57.140
is that all the kayashth Sahaja Yogis have become one group,

00:56:57.599 --> 00:56:59.479
Brahmin Sahaja Yogis have become one,

00:56:59.628 --> 00:57:01.315
Now you all have become Sahaja Yogis,

00:57:01.531 --> 00:57:04.021
then why are you still worried about brahminism?

00:57:04.275 --> 00:57:07.362
Then kayasth will invite other kayasths  for a meal.

00:57:07.894 --> 00:57:10.149
And Brahmin will invite other brahmins for a meal.

00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:12.419
If you have to do this kind of stupidity,

00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:14.657
then why did you come to Sahaja Yoga?

00:57:14.949 --> 00:57:18.234
There is no Caste and creed in Sahaja Yoga.

00:57:18.774 --> 00:57:22.210
When you could not leave the fundamental wrong thing,

00:57:22.425 --> 00:57:24.425
then what else can you leave?

00:57:25.036 --> 00:57:27.028
Did Shiv Ji have caste and creed?

00:57:27.639 --> 00:57:30.337
People with one blind eye,

00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:33.289
some with broken leg, some with broken hands,

00:57:33.631 --> 00:57:35.806
this kind of handicapped people

00:57:36.028 --> 00:57:38.337
accompanied Him in His marriage procession.

00:57:38.791 --> 00:57:45.733
So, it is against Shiva Tattva to be concerned too much about,

00:57:46.043 --> 00:57:52.560
food that "I am very perticular that the food should be like this".

00:57:53.062 --> 00:57:56.044
And then separate food for Kayasth, separate for Brahmins,

00:57:56.325 --> 00:57:59.221
separate for other casts and separate for Rajputs,

00:57:59.452 --> 00:58:00.816
separate for every one.

00:58:01.198 --> 00:58:02.777
Now, we want only that food.

00:58:03.118 --> 00:58:06.807
I have never understood, till date I could not understand,

00:58:07.054 --> 00:58:10.537
if there is more pleasure in eating different foods,

00:58:10.752 --> 00:58:13.573
then why do these people ask only this type of food.

00:58:15.462 --> 00:58:18.041
What is the reason? For Bengalies Bengali food,

00:58:18.859 --> 00:58:20.898
For Madrasis, Madrasi food,

00:58:22.259 --> 00:58:25.050
Once I asked in our airforce,

00:58:25.251 --> 00:58:29.106
I mean in airlines why there is no good standard food?

00:58:29.688 --> 00:58:33.957
They said "mother, tell us which is India's standard food"?

00:58:34.973 --> 00:58:36.385
That is very true?

00:58:37.290 --> 00:58:40.194
If you prepare some food, they will say "this is madrasi food".

00:58:40.512 --> 00:58:45.226
Madrasi will say "this is Bihari food", this and that and that.

00:58:46.016 --> 00:58:50.127
So, you should know to eat all types of food.

00:58:53.458 --> 00:58:55.799
Because everything starts from the mouth itself.

00:58:55.974 --> 00:58:57.172
This Vaikhari (Marathi word)

00:58:57.363 --> 00:58:58.394
Meaning tongue,

00:58:58.561 --> 00:59:01.973
in our tongue also (while we speak) there should be sweetness)

00:59:02.382 --> 00:59:03.556
(not clear)

00:59:04.512 --> 00:59:06.832
In the smiles of some people it feels sometimes,

00:59:06.976 --> 00:59:09.796
as if Ravana is emerging out of their mouth.

00:59:11.039 --> 00:59:13.237
Then what can be said about their speech?

00:59:13.574 --> 00:59:17.474
And when they talk, it feels as if some chandika is talking,

00:59:17.626 --> 00:59:20.165
perticularly women exhibit this.

00:59:21.443 --> 00:59:23.673
And men also display such action.

00:59:24.446 --> 00:59:27.033
different peculiar things have come up now

00:59:27.486 --> 00:59:28.699
In this

00:59:29.724 --> 00:59:31.239
Where is Shiva Tattva?

00:59:32.074 --> 00:59:35.403
Lord Shiva is the ocean of love,

00:59:36.602 --> 00:59:39.712
He bestows boons even on Rakshasas.

00:59:41.827 --> 00:59:44.533
Lord Shiva has bestowed boons even on rakshasas.

00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:47.174
If we have to awaken His Tattava within us,

00:59:47.507 --> 00:59:51.166
then how could we get entangled in petty matters like this?

00:59:52.126 --> 00:59:54.340
How can we do this? Tell me.

00:59:55.696 --> 00:59:59.187
The way in which we criticize each other

00:59:59.696 --> 01:00:02.694
Some say he is "high"  some say he is" low"

01:00:03.322 --> 01:00:04.917
it is not like Lord Shiva.

01:00:05.854 --> 01:00:09.932
The streams of love are flowing within Lord Shiva,

01:00:11.223 --> 01:00:13.913
And while flowing in this ocean of love –

01:00:14.636 --> 01:00:16.286
you should not say

01:00:17.350 --> 01:00:19.796
such baseless things.

01:00:20.432 --> 01:00:22.280
There is no use of it.

01:00:24.011 --> 01:00:25.384
Mutual love,

01:00:26.122 --> 01:00:27.725
mutual understanding

01:00:28.571 --> 01:00:29.594
and

01:00:30.341 --> 01:00:34.134
joy among one another should be enjoyed.

01:00:35.057 --> 01:00:36.247
Now it is definite,

01:00:36.747 --> 01:00:39.834
that Sahaja Yogis do not fight with each other, I have seen that.

01:00:40.017 --> 01:00:42.342
they meet each other they meet with love.

01:00:42.729 --> 01:00:43.665
But still,

01:00:43.919 --> 01:00:47.093
even now very petty matters which are very personnel,

01:00:47.419 --> 01:00:50.787
like eating- drinking, getting around and moving around

01:00:51.121 --> 01:00:52.748
need to be corrected.

01:00:54.295 --> 01:00:57.089
If we do that it will be wonderful.

01:00:57.272 --> 01:01:00.962
Your attention will go towards your heart,

01:01:01.184 --> 01:01:03.446
will not remain in these things.

01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:06.271
Will not stay in these matters.

01:01:06.723 --> 01:01:08.873
This disorder is more in foreign countries.

01:01:09.239 --> 01:01:12.715
Because there, one better than the other,

01:01:13.255 --> 01:01:15.764
manufacturing units are available for different things.

01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:20.201
And the wearer of those things starts thinking very high of himself.

01:01:22.491 --> 01:01:25.451
Perticulerly in Italy this is too much in vogue.

01:01:25.896 --> 01:01:26.832
But

01:01:27.364 --> 01:01:30.824
you should not get caught in all these things.

01:01:31.748 --> 01:01:33.731
You Lead a simple life.

01:01:34.335 --> 01:01:37.858
In our country, people who lead a simple life

01:01:38.774 --> 01:01:40.290
have attained great heights.

01:01:41.084 --> 01:01:42.782
Others can not achieve this.

01:01:43.976 --> 01:01:47.635
In olden days, since Gandhi Ji asked every one to wear Khadi cloth,

01:01:48.636 --> 01:01:50.572
everyone obeyed and wore khadi.

01:01:51.408 --> 01:01:53.519
He made this rule

01:01:54.422 --> 01:01:56.572
and set everybody right.

01:01:57.184 --> 01:02:00.239
But now you have to set yourself right.

01:02:00.761 --> 01:02:02.292
Because you yourself are

01:02:02.714 --> 01:02:04.634
enlightened by your spirits.

01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:10.720
You are under the direct protection of Shri Shiva.

01:02:12.141 --> 01:02:14.260
You have to correct your own self.

01:02:14.824 --> 01:02:17.371
You don't need to correct others,

01:02:17.666 --> 01:02:19.237
Just correct yourself,

01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:22.062
and feel blessed that you are a self realized person.

01:02:22.269 --> 01:02:23.832
How many were there earlier?

01:02:24.232 --> 01:02:27.016
Only a few of them and they also used to get killed.

01:02:27.381 --> 01:02:31.135
Today you are in thousands, So start doing this.

01:02:32.048 --> 01:02:33.762
Sweetness in your talk,

01:02:34.086 --> 01:02:35.991
not superficially but from the heart.

01:02:36.332 --> 01:02:40.110
when you talk to people from your heart, no one mistakes it.

01:02:41.521 --> 01:02:43.045
So you talk from your heart.

01:02:43.252 --> 01:02:45.680
With children, with elderly people,

01:02:45.919 --> 01:02:48.299
following the bounderies of good conduct,

01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:52.349
when you make yourself happy,

01:02:52.667 --> 01:02:54.722
you will make others also happy.

01:02:55.032 --> 01:02:57.611
But, within you  this

01:02:58.571 --> 01:03:00.488
blessings of Shri Shiva should be there,

01:03:00.862 --> 01:03:03.139
which can make you contented,

01:03:04.195 --> 01:03:06.115
Nothing else can make you that.

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:10.185
So look within yourself and see if "I am contented or not?

01:03:10.844 --> 01:03:12.645
"Am I satisfied or not"?

01:03:12.924 --> 01:03:18.447
"Do I quarrel with others over small – small things"?

01:03:19.257 --> 01:03:22.059
"Or find faults with them"?

01:03:22.512 --> 01:03:25.162
Then definitely there is something wrong with me.

01:03:25.416 --> 01:03:29.063
And, by putting your attention on that also, you can get cleansed.

01:03:29.403 --> 01:03:33.236
Until you see your shortcomings, how could you cleanse them?

01:03:33.927 --> 01:03:35.796
This cleansing is much needed.

01:03:35.995 --> 01:03:37.549
And only by this cleansing,

01:03:37.835 --> 01:03:43.768
You can visualize that God almighty within yourself,

01:03:44.005 --> 01:03:46.606
And other people also can this bliss.

01:03:46.948 --> 01:03:49.463
Infinite blessings.

01:04:03.048 --> 01:04:06.452
It's a very long lecture I have given in Hindi language;

01:04:06.791 --> 01:04:10.778
and because there are very few, also, Sahaja Yogis from abroad.

01:04:11.818 --> 01:04:14.463
What I was telling them was that about the

01:04:14.757 --> 01:04:19.074
Principle of Shiva is in your heart,

01:04:20.011 --> 01:04:22.138
and that reflection is

01:04:22.273 --> 01:04:25.709
not on a chakra, but on a… like a mirror.

01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:30.529
Now, whatever is aaaa visible of you

01:04:31.944 --> 01:04:33.515
is this mirror.

01:04:34.111 --> 01:04:37.118
In this mirror, what reflection you have?

01:04:37.952 --> 01:04:42.529
Do you have a reflection, which is clear, clean?

01:04:42.927 --> 01:04:45.498
Have you cleaned your heart,

01:04:45.776 --> 01:04:51.849
have you cleaned your aaaann  mirror that is reflecting?

01:04:52.697 --> 01:04:54.459
That is what one has to see.

01:04:54.983 --> 01:04:58.720
Now, what I told them at length was this, that how

01:04:58.958 --> 01:05:02.482
there are six enemies we have got.

01:05:03.228 --> 01:05:08.807
And all these six enemies, one after another, try to corrupt us.

01:05:09.696 --> 01:05:11.656
Out of that, I have told them about five,

01:05:11.857 --> 01:05:16.746
The sixth one doesn’t exist much in India, which we call as lust,

01:05:17.357 --> 01:05:18.547
it's much less.

01:05:18.834 --> 01:05:22.430
But, for foreign countries one has to know

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:25.739
that it is one of the major things that they have

01:05:26.018 --> 01:05:28.317
in the West, because they think lustful life,

01:05:28.518 --> 01:05:30.217
is the only life worth living.

01:05:30.996 --> 01:05:32.757
Beyond that, is Shiva.

01:05:34.528 --> 01:05:37.852
And that’s why we have to understood,

01:05:38.075 --> 01:05:41.794
that we have to understand that in our heart,

01:05:42.897 --> 01:05:46.770
the reflection of Shiva is only possible,

01:05:47.174 --> 01:05:50.643
in complete form when we have cleaned our heart.

01:05:51.544 --> 01:05:57.321
To have malice for others, to have lust for others,

01:05:57.798 --> 01:06:01.241
to have anger for others,

01:06:02.361 --> 01:06:04.916
to have envy for others,

01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:09.145
all these reactions within us act,

01:06:09.637 --> 01:06:13.970
and our heart becomes like a stone, it cannot reflect.

01:06:15.269 --> 01:06:17.085
So, if you have to reflect

01:06:17.475 --> 01:06:20.244
the quality of Shiva, which is very important today,

01:06:20.396 --> 01:06:21.596
in this Kali Yuga.

01:06:22.094 --> 01:06:26.918
very… there are very few people who are really reflecting

01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:31.688
the image of Shiva in their own character.

01:06:32.379 --> 01:06:35.910
So, it is important to watch yourself and see for yourself,

01:06:36.343 --> 01:06:39.881
what’s wrong with you? Where am I… where is my attention going?

01:06:40.270 --> 01:06:42.421
Where am I going? What am I doing?

01:06:42.706 --> 01:06:46.627
If you go on judging yourself and not others.

01:06:47.104 --> 01:06:51.540
Also, in… one of the western things is that, they have a

01:06:52.362 --> 01:06:55.723
aaaan right to criticize others, everybody.

01:06:56.454 --> 01:06:58.224
I like it, I don’t like it”.

01:06:58.748 --> 01:07:01.049
Who are you? Why do you say such a thing?

01:07:01.716 --> 01:07:05.001
Somebody had made a beautiful, say, arrangement for you;

01:07:05.306 --> 01:07:08.409
you sit in his house and nicely say, “I don’t like it,”

01:07:09.316 --> 01:07:10.816
to hurt that person.

01:07:13.003 --> 01:07:16.471
After all, who are you? What do you think of yourself?

01:07:17.813 --> 01:07:18.932
Who are you to judge?

01:07:19.154 --> 01:07:21.995
For Sahaja Yoga… Yogis, is prohibited

01:07:22.368 --> 01:07:24.678
to say, “I like” and “I don’t like.”

01:07:26.019 --> 01:07:27.114
Is prohibited.

01:07:28.734 --> 01:07:31.360
Look at Shiva. He likes everything.

01:07:32.168 --> 01:07:34.797
What He wears? Also snakes.

01:07:35.857 --> 01:07:37.749
He likes all kinds of animals.

01:07:38.591 --> 01:07:40.083
Every type of thing

01:07:40.424 --> 01:07:43.728
that we think is not good, ugly, for Him they are not.

01:07:44.253 --> 01:07:48.212
For example, in His wedding He took with Him, in His “Barat”,

01:07:49.173 --> 01:07:51.866
people who were all infirm.

01:07:52.168 --> 01:07:55.398
Some people had one leg; some people had

01:07:56.385 --> 01:08:00.257
limbs broken down, Some had only one eye.

01:08:00.519 --> 01:08:02.670
All such people He carried with them.

01:08:03.027 --> 01:08:07.773
To Him, these people were very dear and He looked after them,

01:08:08.159 --> 01:08:10.413
because He is the source of joy.

01:08:11.104 --> 01:08:13.071
He is the One who gives us joy.

01:08:13.553 --> 01:08:15.727
And the One that makes us joyous.

01:08:16.028 --> 01:08:20.282
The real joy is only possible if, in your heart,

01:08:20.799 --> 01:08:21.951
His reflection is there.

01:08:22.317 --> 01:08:24.396
But if your heart is full of all things,

01:08:25.158 --> 01:08:28.721
that once I have described, it becomes a dirty,

01:08:29.712 --> 01:08:32.365
very, very dirty mirror.

01:08:32.973 --> 01:08:37.015
Very surprising, I told them also, compared to Indians,

01:08:37.245 --> 01:08:40.888
Westerners are not so particular… Western Sahaja Yogis

01:08:41.190 --> 01:08:43.507
are not so particular about their comfort.

01:08:43.849 --> 01:08:46.674
Though they come from a very materialistic surrounding,

01:08:46.849 --> 01:08:48.118
they are not so much bothered.

01:08:48.298 --> 01:08:51.361
They can live anywhere, they can be happy anywhere.

01:08:51.496 --> 01:08:55.256
That’s a very good stage they have reached and that’s what’s

01:08:55.494 --> 01:08:57.351
the Indians must try to follow

01:08:57.621 --> 01:09:00.264
and don’t pay attention to nonsensical things.

01:09:00.682 --> 01:09:04.580
It is not necessary to waste your energy on nonsensical thing.

01:09:05.421 --> 01:09:08.358
Then only you can have a real Bhakti for

01:09:09.158 --> 01:09:11.364
your Self, for your Atma

01:09:11.587 --> 01:09:16.440
and that is what needed today, that your Spirit should shine

01:09:16.599 --> 01:09:22.550
in your character, in your behavior and in your personality.

01:09:23.431 --> 01:09:26.482
If that happens, then you have achieved,

01:09:26.658 --> 01:09:29.609
what Sahaja Yoga wanted to do for you.

01:09:30.158 --> 01:09:33.211
Is important today, very important. If you read

01:09:33.433 --> 01:09:36.100
the newspapers, you can’t read it.

01:09:36.259 --> 01:09:41.068
And what you need is to change; the transformation;

01:09:41.576 --> 01:09:44.298
as we in Hindi call it ‘pariwartan’,

01:09:44.775 --> 01:09:48.655
of human beings into Selfhood, into Self-awareness,

01:09:49.302 --> 01:09:51.175
into the Spirit.

01:09:51.571 --> 01:09:53.751
This has to be done, and the time has come;

01:09:53.952 --> 01:09:55.785
this evolutionary process has started.

01:09:55.999 --> 01:09:57.948
There are so many of them who have got it.

01:09:58.194 --> 01:10:01.873
Now the old saints and

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:05.065
people who were gurus, real gurus,

01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:08.072
they used to really

01:10:08.946 --> 01:10:10.558
test the disciples

01:10:10.788 --> 01:10:14.969
by making them stand on their heads for years together,

01:10:15.192 --> 01:10:18.461
sometimes put them in the water, do all kinds of things.

01:10:20.073 --> 01:10:23.680
They used to beat them and they were very harsh,

01:10:24.125 --> 01:10:25.608
testing all of them.

01:10:26.228 --> 01:10:29.973
And then only, one of them used to get realization.

01:10:31.423 --> 01:10:35.827
Now, what I thought of – its takes too much time,

01:10:36.477 --> 01:10:37.816
to cleanse them,

01:10:38.078 --> 01:10:43.453
to put them into all kinds of dresses, this that,

01:10:43.669 --> 01:10:47.033
send them to Himalayas or to Gobi Desert.

01:10:47.867 --> 01:10:49.827
I thought it will take too much time.

01:10:50.253 --> 01:10:53.030
I said why not first enlighten them?

01:10:53.556 --> 01:10:54.810
Give them the light.

01:10:55.092 --> 01:10:57.144
In that light they can see their problems

01:10:57.345 --> 01:10:59.493
and they will themselves correct themself.

01:10:59.753 --> 01:11:03.079
They will be their own guru, and it was successful.

01:11:03.849 --> 01:11:04.936
It was good.

01:11:05.266 --> 01:11:08.055
Now you can see for yourself what you are doing,

01:11:08.544 --> 01:11:11.520
what is your problem, what makes you

01:11:12.886 --> 01:11:15.338
so much different from others

01:11:15.683 --> 01:11:17.706
and what will elevate you.

01:11:18.333 --> 01:11:23.003
Because Sadashiva’s place is above the head,

01:11:23.512 --> 01:11:26.400
above your thoughts, above your mind,

01:11:26.687 --> 01:11:28.916
above your emotions. It’s here,

01:11:29.671 --> 01:11:31.531
and you have to cross this limit.

01:11:32.055 --> 01:11:35.682
Only when you do not react to things, and also

01:11:36.126 --> 01:11:40.741
to you nothing is important than Shiva,

01:11:41.694 --> 01:11:43.217
then only it will work out.

01:11:43.717 --> 01:11:46.153
So, in some things Indians have to learn,

01:11:46.352 --> 01:11:49.732
and in some things you foreigners have to learn.

01:11:50.249 --> 01:11:53.129
So many things you have done, I must thank you very much.

01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:55.386
People used to think that I cannot do anything.

01:11:55.537 --> 01:11:56.616
you have given up drinking,

01:11:56.817 --> 01:11:59.481
you have given up all kinds of bad habits,

01:11:59.717 --> 01:12:02.812
you are no more womanizers, your attention is so clean,

01:12:03.013 --> 01:12:06.291
so many things you have done, which is really praise-worthy.

01:12:06.617 --> 01:12:10.082
But still, you must learn that still,

01:12:10.283 --> 01:12:13.808
there are certain things lingering, which must be cleared out

01:12:14.316 --> 01:12:17.181
and must be absolutely finished.

01:12:17.503 --> 01:12:19.978
You don’t have very much politics

01:12:20.177 --> 01:12:24.603
but sometimes there is also politics, aaah group forming is there.

01:12:24.795 --> 01:12:27.096
All this has to go away, because for Shiva,

01:12:27.297 --> 01:12:30.003
what is this? The whole universe is at His feet.

01:12:30.522 --> 01:12:31.546
To Him

01:12:32.641 --> 01:12:35.234
to have a one group here and a one group there,

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:36.766
all that doesn’t matter.

01:12:37.124 --> 01:12:40.742
To Him, it doesn’t come into His head, you see.

01:12:40.846 --> 01:12:45.247
For a person like a very big ocean, it touches many shores.

01:12:46.097 --> 01:12:51.136
But in itself it is a big ocean, In the same way is Shiva principle,

01:12:51.686 --> 01:12:54.646
and you all should develop that principle of Shiva.

01:12:54.972 --> 01:12:56.718
And then see the joy.

01:12:56.940 --> 01:13:00.809
the joy of this great ocean of love.

01:13:01.881 --> 01:13:04.087
May God bless you.
