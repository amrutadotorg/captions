00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:35.920
Today we are going to perform the Puja of Shri Raja Rajeshwari.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.880
Especially in the south of India,

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:48.999
the Devi is recognized in many forms.

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:56.040
The reason is that here

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.680
there were many Devi bhaktas (devotees of the Goddess), like Adi Shankaracharya,

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.999
and they established the religion of Shakta Dharma.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.360
Shakta Dharma means the religion of Shakti (God's power).

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:25.760
Two kinds of religions started simultaneously.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.160
Ramanujacharya established the Vaishnav religion,

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.720
and

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.600
while following two kinds of religions, people got separated.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.160
The one who is truly Vaishnav (following the Vaishnav religion),

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.720
his work is of Mahalakshmi.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.440
And Mahalakshmi ji

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.080
who has many forms,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.800
assimilates all those forms within Herself;

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.999
like Dharma,

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.640
establishing the Dharma

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.360
and being in the middle path,

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:37.280
going neither to the left nor to the right,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.999
but being in the center.

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:44.000
Such people are called Vaishnavas.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.080
As time passed,

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.320
Vaishnava Dharma spread in Gujarat and other (states of India).

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.999
When one goes through the Vaishnav path,

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.360
through Kundalini,

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.999
then at the end you reach Sahastrara,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.760
but at Sahastrara,

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.920
at the Brahmarandra, is the seat of Sadashiva.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.480
So by following Vaishnava Dharma, at the end,

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:33.680
one reaches Sadashiva,

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.440
who is also the goal of Shakta Dharma.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.280
But one must understand that the power of Kundalini,

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.800
Kundalini Shakti,

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:52.480
passes through the central path.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.640
So how can you separate the two (Shakta and Vaishnava Dharma)?

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.400
The path of Shakti is the central path.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.999
Both the things which were interwoven together were separated,

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:10.440
the reason being

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.760
that in those days the ascent of Kundalini didn't take place.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.240
In Maharashtra, in Kolhapur there is a temple of Mahalakshmi,

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.999
where She is awakened.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.960
There people sing, "Uday uday Ambe."

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.840
Amba is the Shakti.

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:34.520
Kundalini is called Amba.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.400
So in that temple of Mahalakshmi

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.400
they sing about awakening the Shakti.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.160
They don't know why they sing this (bhajan).

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.880
So the Vaishnavas make their path (of evolution),

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:57.040
make the route, the path,

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.440
and when that path is ready,

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.120
then the Kundalini rises through it.

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:12.440
We also do the same in Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.999
When you all put your hands towards Me,

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.480
then slowly all your seven chakras get all right,

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.560
which means that you become a Vaishnav.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.720
From extremes you come to the central path,

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.999
and your chakras settle down properly.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.999
When your chakras are corrected,

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.000
only then Kundalini is awakened.

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:45.480
So that’s why initially you become Vaishnav

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.999
and then you become Shakta.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.880
So, both of them are one (Vaishnav and Shakta religion).

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.999
But in the south (of India)

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.200
many aspects of the Devi are recognized,

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:13.999
and out of these (aspects), Raj Rajeshwari is worshipped a lot.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.999
The Lakshmi

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:28.640
is on the Vaishnav path, on the path of Vishnu, wife of Vishnu,

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.160
and that’s why

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.760
this aspect of Lakshmi was explained,

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.240
which is an aspect of Shakti itself.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.680
Raja Rajeshwari means

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.240
that Kundalini comes to Nabhi.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.960
When Kundalini reaches the Nabhi chakra,

00:06:56.999 --> 00:07:00.520
it acquires the form of Lakshmi,

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:06.560
or gets the reflection of Lakshmi on it.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.999
When this Kundalini reaches the Nabhi chakra,

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.999
then She takes the form of Lakshmi,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.999
It takes the form of many kinds of Lakshmi:

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.600
Gruha Lakshmi, Raja Lakshmi.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.999
There are many Lakshmis,

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:36.999
but Lakshmi takes these forms

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.999
when it gets the Shakti of Kundalini.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.600
They are enlightened only through the union with Kundalini Shakti.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.999
So though Raj Rajeshwari is the power of Kundalini only,

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.200
it takes this form when Kundalini reaches Nabhi chakra.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.999
Then Kundalini itself is recognized as Raj Rajeshwari.

00:08:01.999 --> 00:08:07.200
Or we can say that the aspect of Adi Shakti at Nabhi chakra

00:08:07.999 --> 00:08:10.999
is called Raja Rajeshwari.

00:08:12.999 --> 00:08:16.760
Now the person who has at Nabhi chakra

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.160
the principle of Raja Rajeshwari established,

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:30.999
means that he has Gruha Lakshmi established on the left side

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.999
and Raj Rajeshwari on the right side.

00:08:35.999 --> 00:08:40.760
The highest state of Raja Lakshmi
is considered to be Raja Rajeshwari.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.240
Now at the last stage of Raj Rajeshwari,

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.320
how should a Sahaj Yogi be?

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:55.360
The blessings of Lakshmi have to be there, at this stage.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:02.600
After Kundalini awakening, a person

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.999
receives the blessings of Lakshmi.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.480
They have to come definitely.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:17.400
All the Sahaj Yogis receive the blessings of Lakshmi,

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.999
and sometimes this Lakshmi

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.800
can increase a lot, unexpectedly.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.160
And even if it does not increase,

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:37.999
such a man gets the attiutude of a king.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:46.880
Until your attitude becomes like that (attitude of a king),

00:09:46.999 --> 00:09:51.800
you must understand that the Kundalini is still lost at Nabhi.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.080
The temperament changes!

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:59.040
The biggest miracle which happens after coming to Sahaj Yoga

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:03.240
is that a person's temperament changes,

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.240
his nature changes.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.440
A man who is full of a-Lakshmi,

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:15.560
within whom Lakshmi is not visible,

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.680
- means there are many rich people also,

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.080
who are miserly.

00:10:21.999 --> 00:10:25.320
So they cannot be called as Lakshmi-pati.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.400
There is no form of Lakshmi visible in them.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.960
They live like beggars, all the time crying for money.

00:10:31.999 --> 00:10:35.999
It's very difficult for them to give some money to others.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.999
In such miserly people,

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:45.080
Kundalini has not yet awakened.

00:10:46.999 --> 00:10:49.999
They die of miserliness.

00:10:50.999 --> 00:10:54.960
They are so miserly, and think so much about money

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.640
that their liver can also get destroyed.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:03.360
Their face will be just like a beggar.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.960
So just to achieve the Lakshmi (material wellbeing)

00:11:10.999 --> 00:11:14.240
is not the work of Kundalini.

00:11:15.999 --> 00:11:21.999
To establish the essence of Lakshmi within is the work of Kundalini.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.960
So  Raja Rajeshwari

00:11:28.999 --> 00:11:33.520
is that power of Kundalini which establishes within you.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.600
The essence of Lakshmi-pati is Raja Rajeshwari.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.600
It doesn’t mean that you should get lots of money,

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:49.999
but should become generous, as if you are a king.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.800
Raja Rajeshwari means that you develop the temperament of a king.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.400
Here even the kings are like beggars,

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.840
and they are miserly,

00:12:02.999 --> 00:12:06.680
they are liars, they take bribes, and do all such things.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.200
But here we are talking about the pure form.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.960
The one who worships Raj Rajeshwari,

00:12:15.999 --> 00:12:18.840
and the one who has achieves it,

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.880
has so many qualities

00:12:21.999 --> 00:12:25.999
that they maybe cannot be described in today's lecture.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.960
But the biggest thing which happens

00:12:30.999 --> 00:12:35.999
is that one develops generosity,

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.640
he becomes generous,

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:50.240
knowing that he is nourished by the power of Raj Rajeshwari.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.999
"I will never have any shortage of money or anything else.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.240
So why not just enjoy!

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:04.240
Why not make myself happy by giving to others?"

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:12.880
In olden times, when kings were pleased,

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:18.999
then they would give the most precious things to those near them.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.520
The man who does not have generosity,

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.200
his (life's) meaning is incomplete.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.920
The most important thing is that

00:13:34.999 --> 00:13:40.400
no king begs in front of anyone, ever!

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.840
He might get poor,

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.400
and maybe even his entire property is lost,

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.800
but he will not go and beg in front of anyone.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.920
He might die, but he will not beg.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.640
So Sahaja Yogis develop a temperament of a king.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:06.440
Even their lifestyle is king's like.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.999
He does not go about wearing torn clothes,

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.999
like these people from Hare Rama.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.999
They take the name of Shri Ram and Shri Krishna,

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.999
and Krishna is Himself Kubera,

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:24.999
but as people of His kingdom, they roam about like beggars.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:30.880
By no means they know the essence of Krishna.

00:14:30.999 --> 00:14:34.040
But Sahaja Yogis should know

00:14:35.999 --> 00:14:38.960
that according to your temperament,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.080
Paramchaitanya will create your situation.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.999
A man who is always crying for money

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.999
will be in such a situation only -

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:55.999
a man who is always calculating the money

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.960
and who is always busy to make more money.

00:15:00.999 --> 00:15:05.514
There are even people who want to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:05.715 --> 00:15:08.600
These people are completely gone cases!

00:15:09.823 --> 00:15:12.853
No one is worse than them.

00:15:17.832 --> 00:15:20.012
Once

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.520
King Akbar asked Birbal (his minister),

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.140
"Who are the most downtrodden people?"

00:15:29.341 --> 00:15:34.999
So he said, "Those who beg from people in the temple of God".

00:15:35.464 --> 00:15:39.859
When God is sitting here, why are you begging from people?

00:15:41.341 --> 00:15:44.119
Similarly, there are such people also in Sahaja Yoga -

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.999
very few, but there are some -

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:51.345
who think that they have to make money somehow in Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:53.563 --> 00:15:56.119
Someone told me that in Ganapatipule

00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:00.333
Sahaja Yogis brought some things and were selling them.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:05.879
There was one person who took My permission and sold things,

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:09.854
and whatever profit he had, he gave it to Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:10.291 --> 00:16:12.815
But even this shouldn't be done.

00:16:13.016 --> 00:16:17.879
But they say that it's convenient
for people to get sarees and so on.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:22.949
But such a person who only wants to earn money in Sahaja Yoga,

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:27.100
is not worthy of being called Sahaja Yogi.

00:16:34.242 --> 00:16:40.310
You cannot understand the power of Raja Rajeshwari through him.

00:16:41.086 --> 00:16:46.577
With Raja Rajeshwari power, whether a man has money or not,

00:16:49.397 --> 00:16:56.637
there is no fear in him.

00:16:59.224 --> 00:17:05.689
There is no feeling of any shortage,

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:08.439
that, "I have a scarcity of this".

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:13.199
He feels, "I am totally complete. What else should I do?

00:17:13.481 --> 00:17:16.305
What else do I need?

00:17:17.999 --> 00:17:19.798
Why should I be scared?

00:17:19.999 --> 00:17:25.160
Wherever I am, I will have prosperity.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.545
I can achieve everything there."

00:17:29.311 --> 00:17:32.049
And such a man

00:17:34.624 --> 00:17:40.862
lives his life in a very majestical way.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.086
His temperament is like

00:17:50.999 --> 00:17:57.894
a very magnificent and great human being.

00:18:00.999 --> 00:18:05.538
He enjoys only giving, not accepting.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.752
If someone is rich, then he is rich only for himself,

00:18:10.953 --> 00:18:15.610
and if someone is poor, then also he is poor only for himself.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:20.243
But for a Sahaja Yogi, whether a person is rich or poor,

00:18:20.444 --> 00:18:23.662
for him it's (not important),

00:18:26.221 --> 00:18:30.376
he will be completely ready to help that person.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.429
There are also such people in Sahaja Yoga

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:38.011
who do a lot for asahaj people,

00:18:38.968 --> 00:18:41.664
but if some poor Sahaja Yogi come,

00:18:41.865 --> 00:18:45.234
they don't even offer him a chair to sit on.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.341
So by looking at the exterior grandeur (of people)

00:18:51.817 --> 00:18:54.949
many people give them a lot of importance.

00:18:54.949 --> 00:18:58.279
“He is very great", "he has so many cars",

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:02.999
or "he is a very famous actor",

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:07.240
or "a famous doctor", "architect", "a very great man”.

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:13.893
These titles are very outward things, and they are given importance.

00:19:14.999 --> 00:19:18.692
But if someone thinks that,

00:19:18.893 --> 00:19:23.999
“The power is flowing through this man,

00:19:26.497 --> 00:19:30.633
such powerful vibrations are flowing through him.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.543
Who is this great saint?"

00:19:36.889 --> 00:19:40.902
Such a person possess a temperament like a king, we can say.

00:19:41.103 --> 00:19:44.679
There are many such people in our country.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:48.907
We have the special example of Shivaji Maharaj.

00:19:50.542 --> 00:19:53.141
He was a great saint,

00:19:54.126 --> 00:19:57.320
a realized soul and a very ideal person,

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.282
but his behavior towards saints

00:20:00.483 --> 00:20:06.822
was extremely beautiful and polite.

00:20:08.169 --> 00:20:13.639
Once his guru, Shri Ramdas arrived

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.805
and he called on Shivaji.

00:20:17.863 --> 00:20:22.403
Shivaji Maharaj wrote a letter and put it in his bag.

00:20:23.325 --> 00:20:26.839
In that letter it was written, "Guru, O my Guru,

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:33.680
All of my power, my kingdom

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.407
everything, I am giving to you."

00:20:39.343 --> 00:20:41.666
After reading that letter,

00:20:41.867 --> 00:20:45.960
Guru Ramdas laughed and said,

00:20:46.161 --> 00:20:49.408
"Son, I am an ascetic.

00:20:49.568 --> 00:20:53.869
What will I do with your kingdom?

00:20:54.901 --> 00:20:59.796
You are the king, and this is your duty (to rule the kingdom).

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.793
But yes, if you think,

00:21:06.872 --> 00:21:14.722
that you should rule this kingdom with bhakti,

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.798
then you can make its flag,

00:21:19.999 --> 00:21:27.977
triangular and the same color as my robe.

00:21:30.999 --> 00:21:35.584
With that flag, people will understand

00:21:35.785 --> 00:21:39.571
that you are ruling with a saintly attitude.

00:21:40.617 --> 00:21:45.196
You don’t have any attraction or attachment for it.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.867
You are the king,

00:21:50.068 --> 00:21:56.202
but still you do not have the consciousness of this fact."

00:21:57.552 --> 00:22:02.422
Those people who are boasting that they are the king

00:22:02.623 --> 00:22:04.760
and go about madly saying this,

00:22:04.999 --> 00:22:08.999
that "I am this", actually they are not that.

00:22:09.362 --> 00:22:12.739
And those who are, they never say so.

00:22:14.863 --> 00:22:18.222
You will see many such people.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.956
Once I was traveling in London.

00:22:23.999 --> 00:22:28.279
There was a gentlemen sitting far who started talking to Me.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:35.010
(Men) usually don’t talk to women, they talk amongst themselves.

00:22:35.943 --> 00:22:39.759
But he asked a lot about India.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:43.098
"How is this? How is that?"

00:22:44.474 --> 00:22:46.640
So I asked, "Did you go to India?"

00:22:46.841 --> 00:22:50.070
He said, "Yes, I was in India for many years."

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:56.950
And he did not say anything about himself, who he was.

00:22:57.573 --> 00:23:01.571
Then he disembarked and left and I also left.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:07.119
Later, one day,

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:12.124
I was traveling with My husband and we met him again in the train.

00:23:13.777 --> 00:23:16.319
So he invited us to his house

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:19.960
to discuss about India.

00:23:21.091 --> 00:23:26.560
So when we reached, we found that he had a very big house.

00:23:26.761 --> 00:23:30.024
We found out he was the Viceroy in India!

00:23:32.079 --> 00:23:34.120
But he never said it himself!

00:23:34.321 --> 00:23:36.798
We didn’t even know that he was the Viceroy.

00:23:36.999 --> 00:23:40.685
In earlier times, people could not even meet the Viceroy.

00:23:42.415 --> 00:23:44.600
And he talked to us with so much humility,

00:23:44.801 --> 00:23:47.385
"If you have any problem, let me know".

00:23:47.586 --> 00:23:49.523
Being a lady, I was thinking,

00:23:49.724 --> 00:23:51.955
"Why is he giving Me so much importance?"

00:23:52.156 --> 00:23:53.742
"Are You having any problem?

00:23:53.943 --> 00:23:56.840
People here are a bit stubborn", all these kind of talks!

00:23:57.696 --> 00:24:00.124
"They are not like Indians. They are not dharmic."

00:24:00.325 --> 00:24:04.361
All these kind of talks. But he never said that he was a Viceroy!

00:24:05.239 --> 00:24:08.280
And he had so much respect for Indians.

00:24:08.481 --> 00:24:10.839
He was talking about them with so much love.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:14.063
In our country,

00:24:15.305 --> 00:24:19.749
if someone is a minister's assistant, even that makes him crazy.

00:24:21.172 --> 00:24:24.459
There is a story that when some people went to meet the minister,

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.639
there was a man who was shouting a lot.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.202
So they asked, "Why are you so angry?"

00:24:29.403 --> 00:24:33.208
He said, "Don’t you know? I am the P.A. (drunk in Hindi)".

00:24:36.153 --> 00:24:39.719
If people get even a little bit,

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.277
their minds get damaged,

00:24:42.478 --> 00:24:45.798
and this is not a symptom of a king.

00:24:47.864 --> 00:24:52.058
The first quality of a king is that he is extremely polite.

00:24:52.407 --> 00:24:56.480
Arrogance comes in a man because he thinks,

00:24:56.681 --> 00:25:01.058
"I am so wealthy. I can scold everyone, shout at everyone".

00:25:02.437 --> 00:25:09.660
Or if he is highly educated, has a high position,

00:25:09.861 --> 00:25:13.692
or is the son of an important father, he gets more arrogant.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.787
You can't even talk to him!

00:25:18.384 --> 00:25:23.194
I have noticed

00:25:23.464 --> 00:25:26.662
that even common men -

00:25:26.863 --> 00:25:32.999
like in My husband's office, they would answer rudely on the phone.

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:36.999
So once he asked, "Who is speaking?" and he found it was Me.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.879
He was very scared!

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.320
"In the beginning why did you talk so rudely?"

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.999
He said, "Don’t tell Sir about it. Please forgive me!"

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.319
I said, "Why would I tell him?

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.759
But why did you talk like this in the beginning?"

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.931
Water always spills out from a vessel which is half full.

00:25:54.132 --> 00:26:01.263
The person who is complete is extremely polite and simple.

00:26:03.265 --> 00:26:04.840
You will understand that.

00:26:05.041 --> 00:26:08.920
Until you are complete, you will have a false ego,

00:26:10.072 --> 00:26:13.592
false anger,

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:17.759
and you acquire a strange type of personality,

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:21.373
so that anyone who hears your name runs away!

00:26:24.362 --> 00:26:26.093
One type are like beggars.

00:26:26.294 --> 00:26:30.759
When they come, you know they have come to ask for something.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:34.876
"This has happened to me, my father, my mother.

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:38.616
I don’t have money. I want this". Always like a beggar!

00:26:38.878 --> 00:26:43.470
And another type are always shouting.

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:49.158
So first we have to become Vaishnav, to come to the center.

00:26:50.482 --> 00:26:54.758
You can gain the power of Raja Rajeshwari only coming to the center.

00:26:54.959 --> 00:26:57.999
Otherwise it will not work within you!

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:02.320
Like there is no point in watering a plastic plant.

00:27:03.527 --> 00:27:06.835
Similarly, in these people

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:15.384
there is a kind of false show.

00:27:18.054 --> 00:27:23.442
Recently I was coming from London. There was a lady with Me.

00:27:25.086 --> 00:27:31.086
She was wearing many diamonds, in her ears, nose, hands, everywhere.

00:27:33.656 --> 00:27:36.012
So she said,

00:27:36.213 --> 00:27:38.559
"I believe in simple living and high thinking.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:42.796
Live with simplicity and have high thoughts."

00:27:42.997 --> 00:27:46.239
So I said, "Good, very good. Have a seat, please".

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:50.019
She said, "I don’t wear this kind of colored clothes.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:53.612
So, I am very simple." I said, "Very good!"

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.892
Before arriving to India,

00:27:57.093 --> 00:28:00.562
she came to Me, "I have a problem. Please help me out.

00:28:00.763 --> 00:28:03.199
The customs officers respect you a lot,

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:07.879
and I am wearing 650,0000 Rupees worth of jewelries,

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.720
so please take me through customs."

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:14.449
So I said, "You believe in simple living.

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:17.760
So why don't you tell customs that you believe in simple living?

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:21.172
They will release you, just like that!"

00:28:21.373 --> 00:28:24.359
She came behind Me, and the customs people

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:28.496
did namaskar to Me and also to her, and she passed through.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:35.095
Another thing in a man is greed.

00:28:36.304 --> 00:28:41.724
Greed is a very dirty and bad thing.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:47.953
Very low people have greed for others' things.

00:28:49.311 --> 00:28:52.439
As soon as they come from someone's house they start,

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.359
"Let's also get the thing which was in their house".

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:59.901
Bring this thing, then another thing. There is no end to that!

00:29:00.102 --> 00:29:03.082
And greed continues.

00:29:04.839 --> 00:29:08.505
What is the antidote to this greed?

00:29:11.999 --> 00:29:18.631
The antidote is to know what a headache is to own something.

00:29:19.863 --> 00:29:27.599
For example, here is a nice carpet,

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.408
and I start having greed for it,

00:29:30.609 --> 00:29:33.760
"I want to get this carpet".

00:29:33.999 --> 00:29:36.554
I can even steal it,

00:29:36.755 --> 00:29:39.882
and if I don't steel it, then all the time the thoughts will be,

00:29:40.083 --> 00:29:43.990
"Where did this carpet come from? When?" and so on.

00:29:44.191 --> 00:29:47.461
So Puja is on one side,

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.054
and if that carpet is brought and it's laid down here, you'll think,

00:29:53.255 --> 00:29:57.705
"Oh, this carpet will be spoilt. This will happen to it" and so on.

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:03.802
It's better if you understand that this is not your carpet.

00:30:04.003 --> 00:30:06.798
"It belongs to someone else. God save me!"

00:30:06.999 --> 00:30:09.239
That’s all. No more trouble!

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.407
"If it belongs to someone else, then why should I have the headache,

00:30:12.608 --> 00:30:16.682
get it insured, do this, go to the bank.

00:30:16.883 --> 00:30:20.048
Why should I do it? It doesn’t belong to Me.

00:30:20.249 --> 00:30:22.591
Leave it. Do you want to take it? Take it!

00:30:22.792 --> 00:30:26.487
Do you want more? There is more. Very good!"

00:30:30.239 --> 00:30:35.639
This way, the madness of greed

00:30:36.641 --> 00:30:39.962
is completely destroyed.

00:30:41.329 --> 00:30:45.596
And it's a very big problem for Sahaja Yogis

00:30:45.797 --> 00:30:49.439
because on one side they are Sahaja Yogis, and on the other side

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:53.040
their foot is in the mouth of a crocodile called greed.

00:30:53.438 --> 00:30:58.225
So how will they come into the boat? Their foot is stuck there.

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:02.519
If we have greed for anything

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:07.754
then we must realize that Raja Rajeshwari has left us.

00:31:09.203 --> 00:31:12.798
And those who have a temperament of Raj Rajeshwari

00:31:12.999 --> 00:31:16.999
start enjoying even small things!

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:24.427
They never have a shortage of anything.

00:31:28.778 --> 00:31:34.360
Once I went to Palitana. It's a two and a half hour climb journey.

00:31:34.943 --> 00:31:40.200
There, outside, was a temple made of sangamarmar,

00:31:40.401 --> 00:31:43.800
what we call as marble.

00:31:44.797 --> 00:31:48.228
So all those people who were with Me, laid down.

00:31:48.429 --> 00:31:50.588
When I saw what was above, I said, "Look up.

00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:52.209
So many elephants carved

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:55.617
and they all have their tails made in a different way."

00:31:55.913 --> 00:31:59.385
They said, "Mummy, we are so tired.

00:31:59.616 --> 00:32:02.631
How can You see tails of elephants?"

00:32:02.832 --> 00:32:04.963
I said, "See there. You are not looking at them".

00:32:05.164 --> 00:32:06.760
They said, "Aren't You tired?"

00:32:06.961 --> 00:32:11.362
I said, "No, after seeing this art, all My tiredness ran away!"

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:18.259
So we start to enjoy small, small things

00:32:20.117 --> 00:32:25.078
start to enjoy them and feel the satisfaction.

00:32:25.331 --> 00:32:30.533
Like, Shri Ram was so satisfied after eating the berries of Shabri.

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:38.884
When you start to understand this thing, then you can say

00:32:39.085 --> 00:32:44.508
that you are nourished by the power of Raj Rajeshwari.

00:32:47.247 --> 00:32:50.672
If someone gives a small thing with love,

00:32:51.585 --> 00:32:56.040
even a small thing like a betel nut given with love,

00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:03.719
even if I don’t eat betel nut usually, that one I will surely eat,

00:33:04.094 --> 00:33:05.798
to make that other person happy.

00:33:05.999 --> 00:33:09.214
He doesn’t know that I don’t eat betel nut.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:18.073
It means that for any object in this world,

00:33:18.274 --> 00:33:23.999
if you put on, for example on the glass,

00:33:26.552 --> 00:33:29.298
if you put mercury,

00:33:30.321 --> 00:33:36.719
any ordinary glass which is transparent, if you put mercury,

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:41.505
then it becomes a mirror in which you can see your reflection.

00:33:41.807 --> 00:33:45.018
On any object, if you add love

00:33:46.391 --> 00:33:49.938
that object becomes so beautiful.

00:33:51.047 --> 00:33:54.666
Then you want to give it to someone.

00:33:55.291 --> 00:33:58.040
Like when you go to the market, you will feel that,

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:01.439
"Yes, this is good for him, this is good for her".

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:05.671
What is good for yourself, this thought shouldn’t even come.

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:16.480
If this thought comes, "What do I want? What do I like?", finished!

00:34:17.831 --> 00:34:23.798
It means that the All-pervading Power has not yet come within you.

00:34:24.388 --> 00:34:28.388
If the All-pervading Power comes within you,

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:32.798
then you will become very wise

00:34:32.999 --> 00:34:37.999
and will know what is the need of everybody.

00:34:38.769 --> 00:34:44.872
Like if you go somewhere and you see

00:34:45.073 --> 00:34:50.737
that there is a very beautiful lamp,

00:34:51.908 --> 00:34:54.439
you think, "Yes, I stayed in their house

00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:59.133
and they didn’t have this lamp. So I should get it for them."

00:35:00.831 --> 00:35:03.719
You start to understand everyone’s needs,

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:06.808
when your own needs disappear.

00:35:07.495 --> 00:35:12.839
You remember everyone's problems.

00:35:13.222 --> 00:35:15.594
Someone is sick,

00:35:15.795 --> 00:35:18.798
someone needs something,

00:35:18.999 --> 00:35:23.878
someone doesn’t have a tape recorder

00:35:24.079 --> 00:35:26.459
and he wants to hear My speech,

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:28.760
all this you know.

00:35:28.961 --> 00:35:31.009
And when you give him that thing,

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:33.798
he says, "Mother, how did you find out that I need it?"

00:35:33.999 --> 00:35:36.602
What do you mean? I don’t know how.

00:35:37.782 --> 00:35:41.174
That's why love is called knowledge.

00:35:41.816 --> 00:35:44.614
Knowledge is only pure love,

00:35:44.815 --> 00:35:48.546
because when you have pure love for anybody,

00:35:48.747 --> 00:35:52.701
then you have all the knowledge about him, and it happens.

00:35:53.935 --> 00:35:57.191
Even if She is Mahamaya, you can know,

00:35:57.392 --> 00:36:00.330
but you must have pure love.

00:36:01.102 --> 00:36:05.453
The pure love gives you all the knowledge -

00:36:05.999 --> 00:36:09.808
any kind of knowledge, any type.

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:17.798
For example, if you look with pure love to something -

00:36:17.999 --> 00:36:22.999
like in Madras I have seen a lot of poverty and suffering.

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.798
So the thought arose in my mind

00:36:26.999 --> 00:36:32.260
that in this heat there are small small children, old people,

00:36:32.461 --> 00:36:36.164
everyone standing and waiting for the bus for a long time

00:36:36.365 --> 00:36:40.079
and I am sitting in a nice car moving around.

00:36:40.789 --> 00:36:42.951
So I started worrying.

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:44.839
"What should I do about it?"

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:48.068
I said, "Why don’t they arrange a private transport?

00:36:48.269 --> 00:36:51.292
At least some of their misery will be lessened."

00:36:51.493 --> 00:36:53.992
And this is what is staying in My mind,

00:36:54.193 --> 00:36:58.222
that somehow this transport should be organized.

00:36:59.454 --> 00:37:01.840
So when you get Realization,

00:37:02.041 --> 00:37:05.523
then you are bound by the brotherhood of the entire world.

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:09.798
It's such a great work of Shri Raja Rajeshwari,

00:37:09.999 --> 00:37:12.168
that you can think about everybody!

00:37:12.369 --> 00:37:14.676
Like the queen of a king

00:37:14.877 --> 00:37:19.563
will look at the problems of her people

00:37:19.764 --> 00:37:22.040
and will remove their problems.

00:37:22.241 --> 00:37:25.557
She will not sit down counting how many jewelries she has,

00:37:25.758 --> 00:37:28.798
how many diamonds she has.

00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:31.719
She will see,

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:36.399
"How many people in my kingdom are suffering?

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:39.178
What small things even do they need?"

00:37:39.379 --> 00:37:42.798
Similarly, your temperament also becomes like this.

00:37:42.999 --> 00:37:48.644
Until you raise to a higher state,

00:37:48.845 --> 00:37:54.488
how can you be a worshipper of Vishwa Nirmal Dharma?

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:59.679
And Vishwa Nirmal Dharma is not something outward,

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:03.917
like, "I am Hindu, or Muslim or Christian." It's not like this.

00:38:04.118 --> 00:38:07.079
This is an internal light,

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:09.254
and in this light a human being

00:38:09.455 --> 00:38:14.194
comes out with a very majestic personality.

00:38:15.727 --> 00:38:18.513
He doesn’t think,

00:38:18.714 --> 00:38:23.335
"What am I getting? What have I achieved?"

00:38:23.536 --> 00:38:31.439
He only thinks, "What can I do for others?

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:33.520
I have done very less.

00:38:33.721 --> 00:38:36.696
Oh Mother! I could give Realization to only 100 people.

00:38:36.897 --> 00:38:38.679
I couldn’t do anything more!"

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:43.585
When one starts thinking like this, then he must understand

00:38:43.786 --> 00:38:50.448
that the power of Raja Rajeshwari is overflowing within him.

00:38:50.649 --> 00:38:53.627
It's shining. It's troubling him that,

00:38:53.828 --> 00:38:55.790
"What are you doing? You have so much power.

00:38:55.999 --> 00:38:58.653
Why are you not giving it to others?"

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:04.399
This cannot be measured by money or anything else.

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:07.367
Like today I was late.

00:39:07.568 --> 00:39:11.123
There was a phone call from Russia so I was delayed.

00:39:11.999 --> 00:39:16.479
So on the way I asked, "Where is everyone sitting?"

00:39:16.946 --> 00:39:18.616
They said, "In the open."

00:39:18.817 --> 00:39:22.715
So I said, "Did you put up some shade for them?" They didn’t know.

00:39:22.916 --> 00:39:26.208
They said, "Mother, may not be a roof, but cool breeze is blowing!"

00:39:26.409 --> 00:39:27.999
I said, "But a roof should be there.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:31.999
I won't like to have a roof only above Me and not above others."

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.866
So they said, "It's like this, with roof only above You."

00:39:35.067 --> 00:39:36.490
"This is not correct".

00:39:36.691 --> 00:39:41.279
Finally when I saw they all had a roof above them, I was very happy.

00:39:48.891 --> 00:39:52.023
Similarly, in Chinddwara also it was very hot

00:39:52.224 --> 00:39:54.277
and everyone was sitting in the open.

00:39:54.478 --> 00:39:56.959
All the time I was worried about what was happening,

00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:59.999
and everyone was saying, "Mother, we were feeling cold from inside".

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:03.439
Although they were sitting in so much heat, they were feeling cold!

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:06.159
This power of Raja Rajeshwari

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:10.719
is benevolent for everyone, everywhere.

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:14.759
It is much more than benevolence, it gives everyone rest,

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:19.012
it gives everyone happiness and joy.

00:40:19.213 --> 00:40:22.798
And the same power you have within yourself.

00:40:22.999 --> 00:40:28.960
If you want, you can take it to a very high level.

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:35.879
The work which can be accomplished with just one paisa

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:39.756
cannot be accomplished with 1000 rupees.

00:40:40.536 --> 00:40:43.798
But the power of giving should be great.

00:40:44.135 --> 00:40:47.119
I will say again that

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:50.628
Shri Krishna went to Vidura's house and ate with him,

00:40:50.829 --> 00:40:52.920
and didn’t eat the delicacies of Duryodhana.

00:40:53.121 --> 00:40:55.759
There is a very important message

00:40:55.960 --> 00:41:00.132
and the message is that, if something is filled with love,

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:07.715
you cannot measure its worth.

00:41:09.375 --> 00:41:13.433
So firstly, Vaishnavas need

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:18.044
to clean their Lakshmi chakra.

00:41:18.849 --> 00:41:23.547
"First of all I don’t have any needs.

00:41:23.748 --> 00:41:28.144
Others have needs, and that's why I have come to Sahaja Yoga."

00:41:28.345 --> 00:41:31.159
You should come with such thoughts.

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:33.199
You will be surprised that yesterday,

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.379
so many people came after the program, and I was very happy.

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:40.547
But suddenly, My right heart was caught up.

00:41:40.999 --> 00:41:44.502
I didn’t understand why right heart catches so much here.

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:49.010
It has never happened before.

00:41:49.518 --> 00:41:54.004
Then this power gave some indication.

00:41:54.205 --> 00:41:59.480
Then I asked, "What is the position of Gruha Lakshmis here?

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:05.840
How do people treat Gruha Lakshmis in Hyderabad?"

00:42:06.318 --> 00:42:09.200
So I found out that they treat them very badly.

00:42:09.401 --> 00:42:11.315
There is no respect for them at all,

00:42:11.516 --> 00:42:14.159
and they are scolding them all the time.

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:17.719
They respect their mother but don’t respect their wife at all.

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:21.583
And they said, "This is the Muslim influence here".

00:42:22.147 --> 00:42:26.486
You don’t know, even Muslims

00:42:26.687 --> 00:42:29.798
how much they talked about respecting the women in Koran,

00:42:29.999 --> 00:42:32.608
but they don’t do it. It's a stupidity!

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:38.142
Respect for women is written there (in Koran) but is nowhere else.

00:42:39.798 --> 00:42:41.798
Then I understood.

00:42:41.999 --> 00:42:47.279
Where women are worshipped, there reside the Devtas.

00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:50.999
Where the women of the house

00:42:52.341 --> 00:42:54.798
are not respected,

00:42:54.999 --> 00:42:58.954
there the Devtas never rule.

00:43:00.209 --> 00:43:06.962
Of course, the simple idea is that

00:43:07.163 --> 00:43:14.980
if you respect you wife completely,

00:43:15.181 --> 00:43:18.270
then children will also respect you and respect themselves.

00:43:18.471 --> 00:43:20.645
This is true.

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:24.890
But if the woman herself is not worthy of being worshipped,

00:43:25.091 --> 00:43:29.631
and she does such things which are not worthy of being worshipped,

00:43:31.321 --> 00:43:34.431
then she must be corrected.

00:43:35.862 --> 00:43:38.916
But if she is a good woman,

00:43:39.117 --> 00:43:42.599
and she takes care of the children of the house

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:46.357
and takes care of the household with love,

00:43:46.596 --> 00:43:49.757
this kind of a woman

00:43:49.958 --> 00:43:53.230
should be respected, not only in the house but also in the society.

00:43:53.431 --> 00:43:56.559
But think about that My entire right heart got caught up,

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:59.319
and for half an hour I was suffering.

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:02.999
All the suffering which you give to your wives,

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:06.261
all that suffering came inside Me!

00:44:06.999 --> 00:44:08.798
Now, it's possible

00:44:08.999 --> 00:44:15.103
that a woman may not understand Sahaja Yoga very well with her mind,

00:44:15.304 --> 00:44:17.618
but with her heart she understands.

00:44:17.819 --> 00:44:20.693
A woman understands things with her heart,

00:44:20.894 --> 00:44:23.971
and a man understands with his mind.

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:28.206
But it's a very big thing to understand with one's heart,

00:44:28.556 --> 00:44:31.999
and women are always considered as a form of Shakti.

00:44:32.303 --> 00:44:34.519
In a house where a woman is not respected,

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:38.055
nothing will work out properly.

00:44:38.256 --> 00:44:41.079
The reason is, if woman only is the power -

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:43.903
for example, if this does not have power,

00:44:44.104 --> 00:44:45.759
then what is the use of My talking?

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.639
This big thing is kept here,

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:50.840
but it's of no use if it does not have electricity.

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:55.400
If you suppress the woman of the house like this,

00:44:55.601 --> 00:44:57.839
and she is not respected,

00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:01.133
the power cannot work within you.

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.798
This is a very big fault.

00:45:04.999 --> 00:45:07.359
I don't know why, it never happened before

00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:09.490
but yesterday, after the program,

00:45:09.691 --> 00:45:13.103
the entire right heart was caught up so badly.

00:45:13.798 --> 00:45:17.867
I used to think that these things happen more in North India,

00:45:18.068 --> 00:45:19.744
but I see they are more in South India.

00:45:19.945 --> 00:45:23.088
North Indians don’t do it so much.

00:45:24.902 --> 00:45:28.370
If Indians have a shortcoming, it's only this one,

00:45:28.571 --> 00:45:31.798
that they don’t give respect for the women's power.

00:45:32.189 --> 00:45:35.760
The biggest shortcoming! On one side they will worship the Goddess,

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:38.091
will recognize Her as innocent Goddess,

00:45:38.292 --> 00:45:42.595
will recognize Her in all Her forms, but not as Gruha Lakshmi.

00:45:43.987 --> 00:45:48.229
That’s why today I want to say clearly that if you are Sahaja Yogis,

00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:51.991
then keep your respect towards your women.

00:45:52.192 --> 00:45:55.679
I have heard that openly you are scolding them.

00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:59.080
Then openly you will also be insulted.

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:04.347
A man has no right to insult a woman,

00:46:04.877 --> 00:46:07.250
for no reason.

00:46:11.215 --> 00:46:15.015
I think that if this thing can get right,

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:19.999
then the powers of  Raja Rajeshwari will be definitely activated.

00:46:22.689 --> 00:46:25.239
You should understand completely

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:31.652
that husband and wife are the two wheels of a chariot,

00:46:31.853 --> 00:46:33.842
one on the left, and the other on the right.

00:46:34.043 --> 00:46:36.726
Left one cannot come to the right, right cannot come to the left.

00:46:36.927 --> 00:46:39.443
Both have to keep their place.

00:46:39.923 --> 00:46:44.410
Both of them are similar but their places are different.

00:46:44.611 --> 00:46:47.270
It means no place is higher or lower.

00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:49.965
If one wheel gets lower, the chariot will not move forward.

00:46:50.166 --> 00:46:52.549
It will keep rotating in one place.

00:46:53.999 --> 00:46:59.106
Children also learn these things from you.

00:46:59.307 --> 00:47:02.798
If children cannot respect their mother,

00:47:02.999 --> 00:47:06.805
what can they do then in this world? How can they respect Me?

00:47:08.962 --> 00:47:12.632
That’s why I have a request from everybody,

00:47:12.841 --> 00:47:17.079
that from today don’t insult anymore the women in your house.

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:20.052
Don't make them look smaller in any way.

00:47:20.253 --> 00:47:22.639
Their power is very important for you.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:25.279
Similarly, women should also go deeper in Sahaj

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:29.545
and should assume their powers,

00:47:29.746 --> 00:47:32.611
should achieve their powers.

00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:39.839
Today, so many people have come for the Puja.

00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:43.735
They have come from the whole of India.

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:47.719
I did not expect that.

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:53.028
Now Sahaja Yoga is indeed getting very integrated

00:47:53.229 --> 00:47:57.393
and things are happening with so much love.

00:48:00.094 --> 00:48:02.693
Everywhere, wherever I look,

00:48:02.894 --> 00:48:09.025
it looks like Sahaja Yoga is spreading with great speed.

00:48:10.968 --> 00:48:17.698
But we must understand one thing,

00:48:17.899 --> 00:48:21.301
how deep we have gone.

00:48:21.502 --> 00:48:24.058
It is very important.

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:27.839
The number is increasing,

00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:32.139
but there is no advantage in a big quantity.

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:41.920
Until the time

00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:45.006
the values of Sahaja Yoga come within you,

00:48:45.223 --> 00:48:47.501
the quality will not be achieved.

00:48:47.702 --> 00:48:53.522
If you respect Raja Rajeshwari,

00:48:53.723 --> 00:48:56.499
then Her powers increase within you.

00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:59.680
Its manifestation should be within you.

00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:03.239
If not, then it's all right also.

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:05.702
You have taken off one robe and put on another one.

00:49:05.903 --> 00:49:07.671
It's all outward thing.

00:49:07.872 --> 00:49:09.896
Nothing happened inside.

00:49:10.097 --> 00:49:15.497
This is an innate power and it should be visible

00:49:15.698 --> 00:49:19.255
in your behavior, conversation, everything.

00:49:21.001 --> 00:49:23.652
Unlimited blessings to you all.
