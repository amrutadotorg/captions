1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:08,290
I bow to all seekers of truth.

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:17,689
These are the special times when so many seekers
are born all over the world.

3
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:27,670
We are not aware as to the nature of this
time, when we get so much worried, anxious

4
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:38,350
and upset with so many things happening around
us and we do not find any answer to it.

5
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:47,370
Sometimes if you read some of the books which
give all the datas about what is expected

6
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:56,430
of human beings many people have now, I think,
accepted the ultimate doom and they think

7
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:02,970
that after all the doom has to come so why
worry.

8
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:10,720
Even Mohammad Sahib has talked about the doomsday
but much more than that he has talked about

9
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,720
the days of resurrection.

10
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:20,780
They all have talked about the future, the
day of judgement, the day of resurrection.

11
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,370
When is this going to happen and how it is
going to happen?

12
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:31,910
We have to first of all know that why are
we seekers and what are we seeking?

13
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:40,789
When I said that you are the seekers of truth
we have to find out first of all what is the

14
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:47,640
truth, and for that finding out we have to
just use some logic, we have to come to some

15
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,360
logical conclusion.

16
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,720
Now the first thing one must know that we
have become human beings from amoeba stage.

17
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,100
We have come to this stage with a purpose,
it is not purposeless.

18
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,520
But why have we become a human being?

19
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,349
There must be some purpose and if this purpose
has to be served it will be served not by

20
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:22,089
some sort of an outward happening but something
inward has to happen to our awareness.

21
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:28,860
Like animals do not have any awareness of
cleanliness, of beauty, but human beings have.

22
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:36,469
In the same way when we become a higher personality
we have to have something happening, happening

23
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:39,430
again I say, to our awareness.

24
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:45,579
And for this I would say Jung has done lot
of work, Jung who opposed Freud very much

25
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:55,299
and he said that if man has to evolve little
higher than what he is he will achieve his

26
00:02:55,299 --> 00:03:02,680
own goal and according to him also the goal
of man is to become collectively conscious.

27
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:10,719
So even the scientists, the psychologists
have prepared the stage for our ascent.

28
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:17,069
Even Darwin who did not believe in God but
he did say that, " If man has come so far

29
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:24,238
he has to go still further somewhere at his
destination."

30
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:31,299
Even he would not accept a situation or a
proposition in which one has to say that there

31
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:35,549
is no purpose of nature in creating human
beings.

32
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:42,510
The second conclusion we have to come to very
logically, understandingly, is that the process

33
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:47,279
of evolution has been done by the living force
of life.

34
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:50,819
It's not done by something which is dead.

35
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:55,988
Like supposing we read the book it's all dead
work or if we stand on our heads or do any

36
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:58,709
such things we don't create anything.

37
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:06,269
Living thing can be understood from, living
process can be understood from a living thing.

38
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:11,900
Like if you have got a seed and it looks like
a dead thing but you put it in the mother

39
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:17,220
earth then it starts sprouting by itself,
spontaneously.

40
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,389
How it happens, why it happens we can't explain,
but it does.

41
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:27,090
You see for yourself that it happens and that
kind of a living force has worked out your

42
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:33,489
evolution without your knowledge but now in
your knowledge it has to happen.

43
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:39,050
That's the only difference between the evolutionary
process so far and further, and because it

44
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:45,620
has to be in your knowledge you are given
complete freedom to choose either the ascent

45
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,930
or the descent.

46
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:53,120
And when you come to this right conclusion
that it has to be done through some living

47
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:01,039
process then you must understand another point
that you cannot pay for it, not a single pi.

48
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,349
Because this is something very difficult for
human beings to understand that you can get

49
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,599
something without paying but you are getting
something.

50
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:11,770
You get the sun's rays without paying for
it.

51
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:17,169
Everything, this pay business and all, this
economic activity has been started by human

52
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,170
beings alone.

53
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:23,490
It's not done by God and perhaps God never
understands money at all but is all done by

54
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,469
human beings and also they want to bring in
God into the same pattern and say that you

55
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:29,490
can sell God.

56
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,330
You cannot organise God and you cannot sell
God.

57
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:39,169
So another conclusion we have to reach that
we cannot purchase God or His Divine Power,

58
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:43,460
this has to be brought to us spontaneously.

59
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:52,659
Means that we cannot sort of work it out ourselves,
it's some sort of a grace or we can say a

60
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:58,629
force that has to work it and when that grace
works it out we can become a higher personality

61
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:04,990
as we have become higher personality so far.

62
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:11,449
Now this grace about which people have talked
that there is an all-pervading power everywhere

63
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:16,680
and this all-pervading power is doing every
living work.

64
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:24,240
Like again I say when the living process where
we see a flower becoming a fruit, thousands

65
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,870
and thousands flowers we see are becoming
fruits.

66
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:28,870
How do they become?

67
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,740
They become spontaneously, but how?

68
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,840
A flower just becomes a fruit, we take it
for granted.

69
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:44,109
Now the thing is, this all-pervading power
is everywhere, is everywhere, and that pervading

70
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,069
power does this living job everywhere.

71
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:56,240
Not only that it makes a flower into a fruit
but also it decides which flower has to become

72
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,560
what fruit.

73
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:07,349
It decides, it co-ordinates, it arranges,
it organises and it loves.

74
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:09,639
So this power we have to feel.

75
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:15,340
We never feel it, we see only nothing but
the breeze blowing but we don't see any power

76
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,638
being existing in this atmosphere.

77
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:25,659
The reason is this power is subtler for our
feelings, we cannot feel it, is the frequency

78
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:28,599
of this power we cannot feel.

79
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:34,569
"So how are we to feel this power?" is the
first question should come logically into

80
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:36,120
our head.

81
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,050
There must be something more must happen to
us we have to become subtler personality to

82
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,900
feel that power.

83
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:51,120
Now this becoming is the knowledge of the
roots, is not the knowledge of the tree.

84
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,330
Whatever we have achieved through our mental
projections or all discoveries and everything

85
00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:01,919
we have done about nature, is we have put
them in the books and all that is nothing

86
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,859
but the knowledge of the tree.

87
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:12,729
But this tree is sustained by the roots and
these roots are sustaining this great tree

88
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:18,340
which is growing, but if this tree doesn't
look after its roots a day will come that

89
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,008
it is going to be destroyed.

90
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:24,939
And that's why people are frightened that
this creation is going to be destroyed now,

91
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:28,099
it's just on the verge of destruction.

92
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:37,860
Even the human beings who are the epitome
of great evolution have done nothing in totality

93
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:45,029
if you see the science has advanced more towards
destruction than towards construction.

94
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:49,320
It has constructed few things, all right,
but in a whole way supposing you construct

95
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,470
the whole house very beautifully, make everything
beautifully and decorate it nicely and then

96
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,170
you put a big bomb underneath it.

97
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,920
That's what we have done out of science.

98
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,089
We have created all these nice things and
then we have got this hydrogen bomb, this

99
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:09,820
bomb, that bomb, planted on all the sites
that if a button is pressed the whole thing

100
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,579
can collapse whatever we have created with
such difficulty.

101
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:20,199
So look at the stupidity of our endeavour,
our enterprise, the way we have worked it

102
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:27,680
out that in totality we are just facing our
own destruction through our own mental projection.

103
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,760
So the other thing that has to happen to us
in our realization is that we find out a method

104
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,480
by which we understand the constructive side
of life.

105
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:46,279
Anything done without the Spirit in it, without
God's grace in it, leads you to destruction.

106
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:52,439
Even the elements can get upset with such
a society and can start destroying such societies

107
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:59,050
but if the elements do not take over it is
only the same societies which are trying to

108
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:04,849
elevate a society to higher level themselves
turn back upon themselves and start destroying

109
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,040
it.

110
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:13,230
Because there are no moorings for us, there
are no roots, because this kite which is flying

111
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,149
has lost its attachments.

112
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:18,250
The attachment has to be to the Spirit.

113
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:24,070
Shri Krishna has said that "Yogakshema (spelling
? sounds like -- na me hum u hum) that you

114
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:28,779
get your 'yoga', means 'union with the Divine'.

115
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:34,790
Once you get union with the Divine then I
look after, "I look after yogashema" means,

116
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:38,959
"I look after your well-being", is said by
Shri Krishna.

117
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,880
But he doesn't say that first I will look
after yogakshema and then you get your yoga

118
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,310
it's the other way round, you have to take
to your yoga.

119
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:51,260
Now the right conclusion about yoga we should
find out what is yoga.

120
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:57,209
Now many people think that doing hatha yoga,
which is just a little bit of standing on

121
00:10:57,209 --> 00:10:59,349
your head business, is yoga.

122
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,350
It is not.

123
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,160
It is very commonly said, "I am doing my yoga".

124
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,510
I mean you can't 'do' yoga you have to be
'in' yoga.

125
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:13,899
'Yoga' means 'union with the Divine' and this
happens to you, it just happens to you by

126
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:19,370
which you become connected with your Spirit,
what Christ has said is the rebirth, we are

127
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,880
to be born again.

128
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,380
But human beings are so much deceptive to
themselves, they deceive themselves so much

129
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:30,420
that I have known people that when I went
to America I told them that you have to be

130
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,060
born again and all that.

131
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:37,138
After that some of them started an organisation
called as Born Again and they just self-certified

132
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:38,920
themselves that, "We are born again."

133
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:44,120
But I mean how can you certify yourself as
born again when you haven't got the qualities,

134
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,220
the capacities and the powers of a twice-born
personality?

135
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:57,509
Now we have to understand also that if it
is going to be a new birth, a transformation

136
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,139
must take place within us.

137
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:01,620
We must have a transformation.

138
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:07,100
But you'll find that all efforts people have
put it in of conditioning, giving puritanical

139
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:13,970
ideas and doing all sorts of things it has
not been able to give people transformation.

140
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,339
It has not led to any transformation.

141
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:23,360
On the contrary, their addictions to all kinds
of habits, addiction to all kinds of thoughts

142
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,430
and also enslavement to all sorts of conditioning
has not at all vanished.

143
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:33,530
In some way or other if they are communists,
they become capitalists, if they are capitalists

144
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,530
they become communist.

145
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:40,540
You see from one to another you are going
into some sort of an ism, ism, ism, ism.

146
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:46,890
But in Sahaja Yoga there is nothing like this
because you are only human beings, only human

147
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:48,360
beings in the eyes of God.

148
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:54,240
He has created variety he has created one
variety of say, Australians, then in Australia

149
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,220
also he has created so many varieties as you
have so many flowers we have so many human

150
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,220
beings.

151
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:07,860
But inside every flower flows this vital force
of God's love and that vital force is to be

152
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:14,670
understood through going into the roots not
from outside through your mental projection.

153
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,899
Actually through your mental projection how
far can you go?

154
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:25,610
Because it's a limited brain that you are
using to understand a problem but you have

155
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,610
to go to the unlimited.

156
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:34,050
If it is so, something has to trigger it,
your ascent, into that space where it is unlimited

157
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:38,949
and that's why we have to know that through
only logical conclusion we can come up to

158
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:45,209
the door but afterwards you have to enter
through this door through that triggering

159
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:48,500
otherwise you cannot enter into it.

160
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:54,270
Now whatever he has told you all about these
chakras you need not believe as Dr Warren

161
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,270
has told you.

162
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:59,490
There's no need to believe into it because
even if you have blind faith it's not going

163
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:00,769
to help us.

164
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:09,079
But as a scientist you must keep your mind
open and you must accept this as a hypothesis

165
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:10,420
placed before you.

166
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:16,389
Now this hypothesis if it is proved right
you have to accept it as a law, the Divine

167
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,430
law.

168
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:24,269
Now this hypothesis is that you have got all
these seven centers within you and you have

169
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:30,360
got the power called as the Kundalini placed
in the triangular bone.

170
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:36,470
Now one may say that this is a Sanskrit word
and Sanskrit is not for only Indians it is

171
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,769
for all of us.

172
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:41,520
As English language is for all of us, in the
same way Sanskrit is also for all of us.

173
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:48,110
But only thing I would say, that as the west
was more busy, and you though you are on the

174
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:53,680
east but still I call it the west, busy with
the advancement outside, there were people

175
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,709
who were busy with the advancement down.

176
00:14:57,709 --> 00:15:04,859
And these people are the seers who have seen
that there is a power which is settled down

177
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,110
in the triangular bone called as sacrum.

178
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,560
Now this is a Greek word.

179
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,250
It is very interesting to know that sacrum
means sacred.

180
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:17,940
And I asked the Greeks when I went to Greece
I asked them, "Why do you call it sacrum?"

181
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:24,210
They said that, "Most of these words have
come to us because we have had a very long

182
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:27,620
rapport with the Indo-Aryan groups."

183
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,700
"So when was that?"

184
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:34,769
They said, "It was much before Alexander went
to India."

185
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:39,290
So we knew about India long time back and
the Indians told us that this is a sacred

186
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,290
bone.

187
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:44,660
Even doctors know that when the whole body
burns this bone does not burn.

188
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:52,689
It takes lot of temperature, very high temperature
to burn this bone and when you put it in the

189
00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:58,029
cremation this thing and all that, that has
to brought to a very high temperature so that

190
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:05,330
this bone should burn but with other temperatures,
lower temperatures, the whole body may burn

191
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,660
but this bone will remain still unburned.

192
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:12,829
So the reason is there is this power which
is protecting it.

193
00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:18,750
Now this power is called as Kundalini because
it has got three and a half coils within it.

194
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:23,009
You might have read some of you, being seekers,
you must have read books about Kundalini and

195
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:27,589
everywhere I go people tell me that, "Mother
we have heard that this is a very dangerous

196
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:33,250
thing to have the Kundalini awakened and it's
very, very wrong to touch it."

197
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,730
Now this is something absurd.

198
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:40,339
First of all this is the only way you are
going to get your realisation.

199
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:45,560
Is the primule, is the germ within you, the
germinating power within you which is going

200
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:51,660
to give you the ascent and how can that be
a thing that will be dangerous for you.

201
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,120
There must be something wrong.

202
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,870
For example, I don't understand about this
instrument or about electricity.

203
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:02,009
I'll put my both the fingers in the plug and
I get a shock and I say, "Oh, it's the most

204
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:06,349
dangerous thing that you can have," that means
I don't know how to handle it.

205
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:11,780
But Kundalini when She is said to be troubling
people it is never the Kundalini but this

206
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:18,339
first centre of innocence which gets into
annoyance and when it gets into annoyance

207
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:25,139
it sends lot of heat in the body and that
heat is felt in the body by so many people.

208
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:33,970
When people who have no authority from God
Almighty, we can say, those who are not holy

209
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:39,040
people, those who are making money in the
name of God, those who are people with very

210
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:45,320
bad characters who have no possibility of
even taking the name of God such people when

211
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:50,899
they try these tricks it happens to you that
you feel that tremendous heat in the body.

212
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:55,160
One must know that heat is not a sign of spirituality.

213
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:01,340
Everywhere, whether is in Sanskrit or any
language, they have said that it's a cooling,

214
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,550
it cools you down.

215
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:07,250
Even a person you say, "He's cool minded",
means he's not violent.

216
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:14,950
Now in science if you try to cool down the
helium gas they, you'll find that when it

217
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:18,930
is not cooled down, it is heated up, all molecules
fight each other.

218
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:22,050
They become so violent that they hit each
other.

219
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:27,080
They form certain groups hit each other, and
then these groups also again hit each other.

220
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:33,510
But when helium gas is cooled down they all
become collective and they start behaving

221
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:36,180
in a manner that is very collective.

222
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:43,160
So the idea is people who say that with Kundalini
you get tremendous heat, you start jumping,

223
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:48,450
and people told me that they start jumping
like a frog.

224
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:52,880
One gentleman sitting before me had put both
his legs on the ground he was sitting.

225
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,870
So they said, "You can't put these feet towards
Mother".

226
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,310
So I asked him, I called him, "What's the
problem?"

227
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,570
You see, Indians understand how to respect
a saint.

228
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:03,679
So I said, "What's the problem?

229
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,690
Why are you putting your legs towards me?"

230
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:10,430
He said, "Mother, if I sit with folded feet
I start jumping like a frog".

231
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,820
So I said, "Are you going to become a frog
now?

232
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,820
Just think about it!

233
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,379
You are not going to become a frog or a bird.

234
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,200
You are going to become a higher personality.

235
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,060
Who has told you that you are becoming a frog?"

236
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:27,580
He said, "My Kundalini is awakened by a guru
and he has given me this book and in that

237
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,929
book it was written", (actually I saw it with
my own eyes, what a misleading thing!), "that

238
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:38,070
he is a person who gets his Kundalini awakened
starts jumping like a frog."

239
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:46,189
Now all these absurd things must be understood
that all abnormalities are dropped out after

240
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:51,670
you become the Spirit because that's the most
beautiful thing you have.

241
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:58,670
Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty and
when the Kundalini rises and pierces through

242
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:06,840
your fontanelle bone area where you actually
get your baptism that time you become a beautiful

243
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:16,120
person, a decent person, a sweet person, a
nice person and you forget all your violence.

244
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:21,229
Not only that but you feel the love for others
and not violence.

245
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:28,380
Your ego drops out, your superego drops out,
means your conditioning drops out.

246
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:34,150
If these transformations don't take place
what's the serve of becoming the Spirit?

247
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,010
So the ideas people have that you start jumping.

248
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:41,080
I know of so many people now who have been
to fake gurus.

249
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,790
And this point I must bring to you because
everywhere I went the newspaper people ask

250
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,670
me about the fake gurus.

251
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:56,830
The other day a American lady asked me in
an interview of radio at Perth that, "How

252
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:02,899
do you explain that the people who are seekers,
the young people, they go to India and they

253
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:10,020
end up penniless and sometimes they get epilepsy
or they take to drugs?

254
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:16,530
Or they become jobless, useless, they live
like cabbages and they have nothing to contribute

255
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:19,050
to the society or to themselves.

256
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,290
How do we explain that?"

257
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:24,050
She says I've got the datas to show you.

258
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,800
I said, "I agreed".

259
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:33,030
I do feel ashamed that these gurus who are
not only fake but they are criminals they

260
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,500
go into another country to make money.

261
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,500
I agree.

262
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,500
I accept.

263
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,850
But also I would blame the people who go to
them.

264
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,520
They are naïve, simple people.

265
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:51,120
They are the ones who are earnestly seeking
but you must come to some logical conclusion

266
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,629
about everything.

267
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:57,800
That is important, because you are here to
get to your Spirit and not to get to a guru.

268
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:03,620
That's one thing one must know that we have
to be the Spirit and not be attached or be

269
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,280
sort of enslaved by any guru whatsoever.

270
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,899
The guru resides within you in your heart
and your Spirit is your heart.

271
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,200
Only thing somebody has to trigger it just
to become that.

272
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:19,800
But the amount of enslavement and all these
things people undergo for nothing at all.

273
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,360
You cannot pay for it.

274
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,600
Anybody who takes money from you is a parasite,
you must know, whether he may be calling himself

275
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,959
anything, by any name.

276
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,620
Don't listen to such a person.

277
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:33,270
Now I've been telling all the people for the
last fourteen years.

278
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:38,010
I was the one fourteen years back, in a very
big hall, at least five, six times bigger

279
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:43,850
than this, called as Jehangi Hall in Bombay,
I spoke so loudly about all of them.

280
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:47,840
I told their names I told them what they were,
how devilish they are.

281
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,959
Keep out from them.

282
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,640
But nobody would listen to me.

283
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,130
Even when I went to America, in the beginning,
nobody would listen to me.

284
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,740
I told them that, "Be careful.

285
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,110
These fake gurus are out, they are going to
loot you.

286
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,610
Be careful about them.!"

287
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:05,350
But nobody would listen to me on this point
because they were so enamoured.

288
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,280
On the contrary, they were teaching me some
wisdom.

289
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,990
"Mother, you must take some money otherwise
Americans won't understand.

290
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,300
If, unless and until they pay for it they
are not going to understand".

291
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,270
I said, "How do you underestimate them?"

292
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,389
They said, "It's true".

293
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:23,310
And I tell you I ended up with some disciples
there or some people who got realisation,

294
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,940
but I was so frustrated.

295
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:31,810
I asked one great saint of India to go down
to New York about two years back, and he ran

296
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,810
away.

297
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:33,810
He ran away.

298
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,909
He said, "I can't manage these Americans.

299
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:40,570
Their whole thinking is just the other way
round, about God, about everything".

300
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:45,510
Now there were people who were teaching that
you can approach God through sex.

301
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:51,050
I mean absurd things, it's obtuse, absolutely
it is opposite of what God is.

302
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:56,149
Not that in Sahaja Yoga we disregard sex,
sex is a part of life.

303
00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:00,880
But sex does not play any part in the ascent
you can see because the first centre here

304
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,990
Mooladhara is for your excretion and for your
sex.

305
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:12,380
So we do not in any way condemn it, but it
has its own sanctity and its own channelising.

306
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:19,920
If you become sort of perverted about it you
develop diseases, there are problems and anything

307
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,610
that is divine cannot give you a disease.

308
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:27,919
So another conclusion they should have reached,
I think, that if you are sick, your head is

309
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:33,230
going, reeling, if you are feeling unhappy,
sickly and you don't know what to do then

310
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,160
why should you stick onto that guru?

311
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,790
Because just you have paid for it?

312
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:40,909
It's like if you go to a drama and it's boring,
you don't like it but you said, "Now we've

313
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,400
paid for it so go through it".

314
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,630
That's all right because drama doesn't make
you mad, you see, but this kind of thing which

315
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,870
is so dangerous even if you have paid, finish
with it.

316
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:53,489
Now we started that we have had enough of
this man.

317
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,940
Now they are buying Rolls Royces, they are
buying aeroplanes.

318
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,990
Look at where is their attention.

319
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:02,920
They're more bothered about gathering money
to themselves and having other people's money

320
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:07,510
as they call them opium and live on that and
thrive on that and why don't you use your

321
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:10,510
brains to understand that how can you pay
for your realisation?

322
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:15,540
It's one of your mistakes, I think, not to
understand that anyone who is interested in

323
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:20,480
your purse is not interested in your Spirit.

324
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,030
Then apart from that there are so many other
mistakes people have committed in pursuit

325
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,200
of God.

326
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:34,040
One has to know that when you get your Spirit
you get your own powers.

327
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:38,780
I may say I'm as these people have said that,
"She's the greatest saint".

328
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,860
All right.

329
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:44,159
If they have said it I say, "All right, because
all the saints in India say so about Me, so

330
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,730
all right, I agree".

331
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:46,960
But I need not say that.

332
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,640
Even if I say, "I'm the greatest", why should
you believe in it?

333
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,110
What have you got?

334
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,580
What powers have you got out of it?

335
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,860
What have you achieved out of it is the point.

336
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:01,419
Is should be absolutely clear cut to you that
unless and until you get your realisation

337
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:05,770
you should not (sounds like pujout) and you
should not accept Sahaja Yoga is the ultimate.

338
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:10,760
You must try to get your realisation, you
must get the mastery over it.

339
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,860
Unless and until you have done it what's the
use of all Sahaja Yoga done to you.

340
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:18,639
After all it is to transform you into a new
life.

341
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,100
Transform you, what is your own, is all your
own property, I would say.

342
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,439
Everything is like a trust.

343
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,020
I sometimes say I'm like a banker.

344
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:34,040
Now you put your money in the bank and I'm
just a banker who has to give your money.

345
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:40,510
I'm little a very gracious banker so I may
give double, four times, five times, ten times,

346
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,990
that's a different point.

347
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:49,610
But you are seekers so you are 'men of God'
as described by another very great saint of

348
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:50,929
England, William Blake.

349
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:58,270
He says he has described all these things
to us very clearly that at this time men of

350
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:05,990
God will be born and they will become prophets
and they will have powers to make others prophet.

351
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:10,100
He has said so clear, everything is so clear-cut,
you can't imagine.

352
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,980
If you read him you will be amazed that he
has even mentioned where the ashram for Sahaja

353
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:19,990
Yoga will be, where I will be staying, into
all details he has mentioned and you must

354
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:24,410
have heard the story of Jerusalem that England
will become chaste.

355
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:29,670
I mean if you are (inaudible) what they have
been doing about hundred years back in India

356
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:36,350
nobody could have believed the stories that
he said, but he could see that the same land

357
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:44,469
which is so aggressive today will become the
land of peace, harmony and of spiritualism.

358
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:49,380
Australia especially I have tremendous respect
for Australia as a land because it plays a

359
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,700
very important role in Sahaja Yoga.

360
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:58,590
This first centre is the Mooladhara, is Australia.

361
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:03,740
Australia is the Mooladhara of the whole universe
and I find every Australian when I meet them

362
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:07,870
there's a kind of an innocence in him which
is still showing now.

363
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:11,989
Of course, innocence can never be destroyed,
it can be covered but it can never be destroyed.

364
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:17,760
I have seen that in Australians there is a
kind of an innocence which shows very sweetly

365
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,120
and that's where it works out very fast.

366
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:27,489
Now Dr Warren he first came to me, and his
friend, and in the beginning they were very

367
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:30,880
volatile people, extremely angry, hot tempered
and all that, you see.

368
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,470
And they came to me when I was on my way to
Pune so I said, "All right, you come along

369
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,690
with me, I haven't got time".

370
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:41,690
I think they came to My house and they touched
their realisation but still they were so volatile

371
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:42,850
and so angry.

372
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:45,179
So I said, "All right, you come along with
Me to Pune".

373
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,580
And you see in Sahaja Yoga we don't take any
money.

374
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,149
Naturally, you see, we haven't got very good
arrangements for you.

375
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:54,820
If you want you can stay in a hotel, if you
want, but as far as we are concerned whatever

376
00:28:54,820 --> 00:29:01,200
Sahaja Yogis had arranged in those days, so
we arranged for them to stay in a (what was

377
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,700
that?) a, some place, all right, and there
there was a doctor from England and these

378
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:12,170
two persons and there was only one mattress
for three of them, you see.

379
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:14,120
There was troubling, pushing each other.

380
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:20,020
In the morning, you see, they got up and they
got into the rickshaw, saying, all their luggage

381
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,020
there.

382
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,020
I said, "Why?"

383
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,379
"We slept on the cement", you see.

384
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,760
I said, "How?"

385
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,450
"We slept on the cement", thrice+.

386
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,450
They went on.

387
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:29,450
I said, "What's the matter?"

388
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:31,020
I said, "How did you sleep on the cement?

389
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,470
They didn't give you any mattress?"

390
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,470
"No, nothing.

391
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:37,720
That fellow from England he was snatching
our mattress all the time and we could not

392
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,880
sleep and we slept on the cement."

393
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:45,790
And in that I felt the sweetness of it, how
sweetly they were telling Me their problems.

394
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:50,290
It's such a simple problem to sleep on the
cement but sleeping on the cement helps a

395
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:54,409
lot, (they did not know at that time), which
helps quite a lot that the Mother Earth sucks

396
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:55,510
your problems.

397
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:58,950
So it was all arranged perhaps that they should
be on the cement.

398
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:04,880
But the way they were angry so sweetly and
everybody enjoyed that anger so much in Pune

399
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,390
and then they got their realisation and I
knew that something good has to happen.

400
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:14,080
Once an Australian gets their realisation
it will work out very fast.

401
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,879
That's what exactly what happened in their
case and should happen everywhere.

402
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:23,060
I'm very happy on my tour last time in Sydney
we did very well.

403
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:29,350
And then we had also this time some program
at Perth for the first time.

404
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:35,010
Many people, about three hundred people, got
realisation and it was wonderful and the whole

405
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:41,170
thing worked out in such a beautiful way that
I am so much encouraged to be here to be with

406
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:45,440
all of you and to do this job, because this
is the job I am here for.

407
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,190
For this you don't have to do anything.

408
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:53,280
First I have to work and then you have to
work for others.

409
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:58,691
There are so many who are lost, so many who
are seekers all over the world it's not in

410
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:00,710
Australia only, everywhere.

411
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:06,140
They have taken to drugs out of seeking, they
have taken to these gurus also out of their

412
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:10,010
seeking, all these problems have come to these
seekers.

413
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:16,640
Even too, I've seen people who were quite
of my age group they told me they have been

414
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,800
to some guru in America and who wanted to
cut their tongues.

415
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,899
All sorts of things they have been trying.

416
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,810
You don't have to do anything like that.

417
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:31,419
You have to be quite intact but only thing
that light within you which is the Spirit

418
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,760
has to shine into your attention.

419
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,210
Tomorrow I'll tell you what is self realisation.

420
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:40,640
Tomorrow I'll tell you exactly what is self
realisation and also I'll tell you about the

421
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,640
chakras.

422
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,430
In any case they have given you the books
which are of course just the beginning of

423
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:51,190
the whole thing is, you can see and read it
and understand what are these chakras and

424
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,410
what do they do.

425
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:58,600
There's nothing to be afraid of, nothing to
be worried, it's your own, it has to happen

426
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,310
spontaneously, it happens absolutely without
any trouble or torture to you.

427
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:10,159
It may happen to all of you, it may happen
to some of you and whatever it is we have

428
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:17,910
come here for this purpose only and I'll work
out till my last breath to see that you get

429
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:18,930
what you deserve.

430
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,280
May God bless you.
