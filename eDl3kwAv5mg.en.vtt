00:11:44.472 --> 00:11:54.462
It’s nice to come back to America....now
there are lots of seekers in this country;

00:11:54.462 --> 00:11:55.462
lost.

00:11:55.462 --> 00:11:58.562
They are frantically seeking, no doubt.

00:11:58.562 --> 00:12:04.882
The are genuine seekers,...ave no doubt about
it....ame back after...ears; it was unfortunate

00:12:04.882 --> 00:12:09.942
because...as busy with other parts of the
world and...new I’d find them again when...ame

00:12:09.942 --> 00:12:10.942
back.

00:12:10.942 --> 00:12:22.952
It is for us to know first of all that if
you are seeking reality, if you are seeking

00:12:22.952 --> 00:12:32.522
the truth, we have to be very honest about
it; extremely honest.

00:12:32.522 --> 00:12:43.642
You have to know that unless and until you
find it, you should not believe anyone., You

00:12:43.642 --> 00:12:47.252
should nbot accept any surface anything.

00:12:47.252 --> 00:12:57.851
People may say anything....ay tell you that
you have to have your realization.

00:12:57.851 --> 00:13:09.271
That doesn’t mean that you have to believe
me...t doesn’t mean that at all.

00:13:09.271 --> 00:13:14.981
But you should not also deny me.

00:13:14.981 --> 00:13:25.042
Now, first of all we should know what we are
seeking.

00:13:25.042 --> 00:13:34.862
There has been never on this earth such an
urge to seek.

00:13:34.862 --> 00:13:42.162
So many seekers!...on’t know if you understand
that...eally different type of category of

00:13:42.162 --> 00:13:43.162
people...

00:13:43.162 --> 00:13:48.332
call them men of God...re born who are seekers.

00:13:48.332 --> 00:13:55.792
And they will go on seeking until they find
the truth.

00:13:55.792 --> 00:14:02.972
But one has to know what we are seeking.

00:14:02.972 --> 00:14:06.092
What are we to seek?

00:14:06.092 --> 00:14:12.422
It is said you have to become.

00:14:12.422 --> 00:14:15.722
You have to be.

00:14:15.722 --> 00:14:20.672
What do we have to be?

00:14:20.672 --> 00:14:26.432
We have to be our Spirit.

00:14:26.432 --> 00:14:35.192
Now we do not know what our Spirit is.

00:14:35.192 --> 00:14:40.242
The Spirit exists, no doubt.

00:14:40.242 --> 00:14:41.692
It watches us.

00:14:41.692 --> 00:14:44.602
We know there is...pirit.

00:14:44.602 --> 00:14:54.802
But how to bring that Spirit into our conscious
mind...nto our central nervous system...s

00:14:54.802 --> 00:14:59.822
the point.

00:14:59.822 --> 00:15:13.192
And when people know that there are such demands,
the market also gets filled with enterprise...s

00:15:13.192 --> 00:15:14.862
very common.

00:15:14.862 --> 00:15:23.512
Americans have the worst hit because you have
worse...ou have money.

00:15:23.512 --> 00:15:25.962
That is the worst part of it.

00:15:25.962 --> 00:15:36.752
And that’s how all of them are different
down here and they have exploited you.

00:15:36.752 --> 00:15:40.522
I’m sorry for all that.

00:15:40.522 --> 00:15:48.062
But...ust tell you that you cannot pay for
your realization.

00:15:48.062 --> 00:15:51.832
It’s an insult of God.

00:15:51.832 --> 00:15:54.852
How can you pay?

00:15:54.852 --> 00:16:00.132
How can you p[ay for His love?

00:16:00.132 --> 00:16:06.912
Do you pay to...ree when it gives you fruit?

00:16:06.912 --> 00:16:10.491
You do not.

00:16:10.491 --> 00:16:15.741
Maybe...erchant might take...ruit and settle.

00:16:15.741 --> 00:16:18.361
It’s much more than that.

00:16:18.361 --> 00:16:21.502
“How can we pay for it?”

00:16:21.502 --> 00:16:25.171
Is...imple question we should ask ourselves;
honestly.

00:16:25.171 --> 00:16:31.782
Then second point is, you cannot have courses
in God realization.

00:16:31.782 --> 00:16:37.032
What university did Christ go?

00:16:37.032 --> 00:16:40.171
He was...imple man.

00:16:40.171 --> 00:16:46.472
Did he go to any university?

00:16:46.472 --> 00:16:50.042
There is no understanding for us.

00:16:50.042 --> 00:16:55.451
That God is for everyone, whether you are
rich people or not.

00:16:55.451 --> 00:16:57.642
Whether you understand this language or that
language, God’s language is of love and

00:16:57.642 --> 00:16:58.741
it’s for everyone…

00:16:58.741 --> 00:17:00.222
every person….for every case.

00:17:00.222 --> 00:17:08.361
It cannot be for one person or one type of
people or of one category.

00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:14.712
But one category is there and they are the
seekers.

00:17:14.712 --> 00:17:24.882
Seekers is...pecial category; but only trouble
is they do not know what they are seeking.

00:17:24.882 --> 00:17:32.981
For this we have to divert to some authentic
people.

00:17:32.981 --> 00:17:36.412
For example, we should see now Christ.

00:17:36.412 --> 00:17:40.431
Christ said that you are to be born again.

00:17:40.431 --> 00:17:48.132
Last time, when...ame to America, they were
taping my speeches and all that in Los Angeles.

00:17:48.132 --> 00:17:58.252
And...as amazed, you see, that poeple objected
to it; felt they should not tape....aid, “Let

00:17:58.252 --> 00:17:59.782
them tape.

00:17:59.782 --> 00:18:02.842
What does it matter?”

00:18:02.842 --> 00:18:08.961
They said, “No Mother, they will publish
it."

00:18:08.961 --> 00:18:12.791
...aid, “Let them publish it.

00:18:12.791 --> 00:18:13.791
It’s...act.

00:18:13.791 --> 00:18:15.831
They should get it.

00:18:15.831 --> 00:18:18.912
They should get their relization.

00:18:18.912 --> 00:18:21.241
They are to be born again."

00:18:21.241 --> 00:18:22.241
But...as amazed!

00:18:22.241 --> 00:18:35.722
Then, they write books as if that was their
knowledge....on’t mind that either.

00:18:35.722 --> 00:18:52.491
But saying that you are to be born again and
they got...ertificate...

00:18:52.491 --> 00:18:55.291
sales certificate...hat we are born again.

00:18:55.291 --> 00:18:59.442
How can you certify yourslf you are born again?

00:18:59.442 --> 00:19:02.892
You have to be honest about it.

00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:10.301
If you are born again something special has
to happen to us.

00:19:10.301 --> 00:19:12.171
Like Jung has said that you have to become...ecome
collectively conscious.

00:19:12.171 --> 00:19:18.071
Not that...ay we are all brothers and sisters
and we are all one.

00:19:18.071 --> 00:19:24.842
No, you have to become that part and parcel
of the whole...s you say the microcosm.

00:19:24.842 --> 00:19:28.752
You have to become this microcosm...as to
become that.

00:19:28.752 --> 00:19:34.882
That means in evolution, your awareness has
to become something more.

00:19:34.882 --> 00:19:40.132
As an animal you see, for example, for an
animal.

00:19:40.132 --> 00:19:42.982
He doesn’t see any colors.

00:19:42.982 --> 00:19:47.491
He doesn’t see whether is filthy or good.

00:19:47.491 --> 00:19:49.331
But you do.

00:19:49.331 --> 00:20:01.252
I’m the same way, if you have to rise higher,
the change has to come in your awareness.

00:20:01.252 --> 00:20:10.051
That is one thing one should know...hat the
transformation has to take place in your awareness.

00:20:10.051 --> 00:20:15.492
And that is what one should see.

00:20:15.492 --> 00:20:18.871
Is there any transformation in awareness?

00:20:18.871 --> 00:20:25.842
For example, there is some lady who starts
jumping on the seat.

00:20:25.842 --> 00:20:29.571
I’ve seen some poeple who come to me.

00:20:29.571 --> 00:20:43.482
They just start jumping and they think they
have got realization.

00:20:43.482 --> 00:20:47.602
How can that be?

00:20:47.602 --> 00:20:55.802
You are not in possession of yourself.

00:20:55.802 --> 00:21:01.332
You have to be your own master.

00:21:01.332 --> 00:21:11.222
Here somebody is making you jump.

00:21:11.222 --> 00:21:19.712
Maybe you are possessed.You have not have
authority over yourself.

00:21:19.712 --> 00:21:25.582
You do not know how to control yourself.

00:21:25.582 --> 00:21:29.672
And how do you say that you have got realization?

00:21:29.672 --> 00:21:33.822
If you become self realized, you are not going
to be enslaved.

00:21:33.822 --> 00:21:38.522
You are going to get over all

00:21:38.522 --> 00:21:40.782
kinds of slavery.

00:21:40.782 --> 00:21:42.162
You have to be...aster.

00:21:42.162 --> 00:21:51.801
This should be the test of anything that you
are seeking.

00:21:51.801 --> 00:21:57.952
What have you got, you say?

00:21:57.952 --> 00:22:04.362
Are you emitting your own powers?...ay say
(as he has said it,...ean,...on’t know why

00:22:04.362 --> 00:22:11.912
Warren said this because...eldom start with
this kind of...hing); but if you wanted to

00:22:11.912 --> 00:22:13.301
see who said it.

00:22:13.301 --> 00:22:22.502
Now to say that...m such and such and such
and such is nonsense....ay be anything.

00:22:22.502 --> 00:22:24.162
So what?

00:22:24.162 --> 00:22:29.952
What did you get is the point!

00:22:29.952 --> 00:22:34.602
Did you feel yourself any more than before?

00:22:34.602 --> 00:22:41.311
Did you get anthing more than you have had
before?

00:22:41.311 --> 00:22:46.681
Not that you become crazy people or recluses.

00:22:46.681 --> 00:22:48.941
That’s not the way.

00:22:48.941 --> 00:22:55.662
You are going to become most normal person...as
to be extremely normal.

00:22:55.662 --> 00:23:01.592
And above all, you have to have complete control
of yourself.

00:23:01.592 --> 00:23:05.551
That is the minimum of minimums one should
know.

00:23:05.551 --> 00:23:16.131
But our idea about self realization is so
much spoiled and so many psuedo people have

00:23:16.131 --> 00:23:22.622
written., even about Kundalini....as amazed
when...ound out that such big, big books are

00:23:22.622 --> 00:23:23.622
written about Kundalini....

00:23:23.622 --> 00:23:30.902
saying it is in the stomache, some say it
is in the nose....

00:23:30.902 --> 00:23:34.861
it is here and there.

00:23:34.861 --> 00:23:38.332
It is not there!

00:23:38.332 --> 00:23:41.631
It is in the sacrum bone.

00:23:41.631 --> 00:23:45.952
You can see it yourself with your own eyes.

00:23:45.952 --> 00:23:50.902
When the Kundalini rises you can see the pulsation
just like...eart....

00:23:50.902 --> 00:23:54.302
not in everyone, of course.

00:23:54.302 --> 00:24:05.712
But in some poeple who have had an obstruction,
you can see with your naked eyes.

00:24:05.712 --> 00:24:16.472
You should be able to see it...appily...nd
you can also feel the pulsation coming to

00:24:16.472 --> 00:24:20.931
the head....ean so many pleople have said
it.

00:24:20.931 --> 00:24:31.631
There are people now,...m told, who are converting
people into Shikhism and this and that.

00:24:31.631 --> 00:24:35.832
And what is Shikhism?

00:24:35.832 --> 00:24:42.672
If you need...ead Kabir (sp ?) who is the
basis of Shikhism.

00:24:42.672 --> 00:24:51.482
He has said that you have to feel the cool
breeze coming out of your head.

00:24:51.482 --> 00:24:52.482
He says...

00:24:52.482 --> 00:24:54.702
(Mother quotes in another language).

00:24:54.702 --> 00:25:04.062
This means, on the head first of all, there
is the sound of Anahada, is this thub-dub

00:25:04.062 --> 00:25:10.821
of the heart and then you feel the cool breeze
coming out.

00:25:10.821 --> 00:25:16.752
Is so clearly said, but who reads those people?

00:25:16.752 --> 00:25:24.251
Those people who talk even of Hinduism and
all that, do they read Adi Shankaracharia?

00:25:24.251 --> 00:25:26.292
What Adi Shankaracharin has said?

00:25:26.292 --> 00:25:36.071
He has written books after books on Kundalini;
and not only, but on this Chaintanyita (sp?)

00:25:36.071 --> 00:25:37.681
he has written...omplete book.

00:25:37.681 --> 00:25:39.561
But people don’t read that.

00:25:39.561 --> 00:25:40.842
You get these...

00:25:40.842 --> 00:25:49.111
don’t know...xtracts and some sort of...on’t
know how they are not afraid of God?

00:25:49.111 --> 00:25:54.861
They are not afraid...ust to make some money...

00:25:54.861 --> 00:25:56.311
don’t know.

00:25:56.311 --> 00:26:04.162
Are they going to carry this money with them?

00:26:04.162 --> 00:26:08.561
It’s very, very wrong!

00:26:08.561 --> 00:26:17.352
It’s very sinful....on’t mind what ever
they do.

00:26:17.352 --> 00:26:28.342
It’s alright if they want to be smugglers
and all.

00:26:28.342 --> 00:26:33.842
There are many like that.

00:26:33.842 --> 00:26:39.342
But they spoil your Kundalini.

00:26:39.342 --> 00:26:40.551
You are damaged.

00:26:40.551 --> 00:26:44.722
And this is the thing which...m concernd about.

00:26:44.722 --> 00:26:46.232
It’s...ery sad thing.

00:26:46.232 --> 00:26:50.142
Coming to America is...eal _____?

00:26:50.142 --> 00:26:57.191
for me because...id send some of the people
who were really realized sould and they came

00:26:57.191 --> 00:26:58.191
here.

00:26:58.191 --> 00:27:00.102
They ran away within...ays.

00:27:00.102 --> 00:27:05.342
They said they will never recognize us...here
is...arrier...here is...arrier.

00:27:05.342 --> 00:27:08.252
They will never recognize Mother.

00:27:08.252 --> 00:27:09.992
They rushed back.

00:27:09.992 --> 00:27:14.952
They stayed in New York, one of them stayed.

00:27:14.952 --> 00:27:16.842
He ran away.

00:27:16.842 --> 00:27:19.371
He couldn’t stand it.

00:27:19.371 --> 00:27:23.802
He said, “They just want something else.

00:27:23.802 --> 00:27:26.321
They don’t want Ìod.

00:27:26.321 --> 00:27:29.492
They don’t want their spirit."

00:27:29.492 --> 00:27:32.131
Of course,...on’t believe that.

00:27:32.131 --> 00:27:40.361
These barriers are created to us because we
read about it.

00:27:40.361 --> 00:27:44.852
We try to understand through reading.

00:27:44.852 --> 00:27:55.571
It’s good, but you must come to...ight conclusion
through logical, logical understanding; not

00:27:55.571 --> 00:27:56.571
rationality.

00:27:56.571 --> 00:28:02.722
Rationality is something which can take you
anywhere.

00:28:02.722 --> 00:28:06.352
Rationality can give you...you can) rationalize
even...urder...nything!

00:28:06.352 --> 00:28:10.561
But, logically, you must understnd.

00:28:10.561 --> 00:28:16.712
Where should we reach?

00:28:16.712 --> 00:28:21.881
What should happen to us?

00:28:21.881 --> 00:28:24.652
As seekers, what are we expecting?

00:28:24.652 --> 00:28:30.871
This is...ery, very precarious and important
time...s more to say.

00:28:30.871 --> 00:28:33.832
The Last Judgement has started.

00:28:33.832 --> 00:28:36.001
That has started.

00:28:36.001 --> 00:28:43.571
That’s how you are all here and you are
seeking.

00:28:43.571 --> 00:28:50.571
The way it will judge, is the Kundalini has
to rise.

00:28:50.571 --> 00:28:53.872
Your have to become self realized.

00:28:53.872 --> 00:28:57.411
Then you start feeling your centers on your
fingers.

00:28:57.411 --> 00:29:08.342
Tomorrow...ill give you all the information
about the centers and all that and...ill tell

00:29:08.342 --> 00:29:12.302
you how He will judge you.

00:29:12.302 --> 00:29:16.922
What are your centers that are catching?

00:29:16.922 --> 00:29:28.432
And then you will judge that and you will
know what is the problem....

00:29:28.432 --> 00:29:34.462
how to get it done...ow to get it alright.

00:29:34.462 --> 00:29:38.502
There is no technique for _____?...ike if
you sow...eed it becomes...ree.

00:29:38.502 --> 00:29:40.531
There is no technique.

00:29:40.531 --> 00:29:43.582
If you have flowers, they become...ruit.

00:29:43.582 --> 00:29:44.852
It’s...iving thing.

00:29:44.852 --> 00:29:49.302
And living things don’t have any technique.

00:29:49.302 --> 00:30:00.352
But once you get connected, then you must
know the Divine laws and you must know the

00:30:00.352 --> 00:30:01.592
Divine technique.

00:30:01.592 --> 00:30:05.312
But first you must be realized.

00:30:05.312 --> 00:30:11.582
Unless and until you are put to the Mains,
how can you use this machine¿ You are not

00:30:11.582 --> 00:30:13.332
yet put to the Mains.

00:30:13.332 --> 00:30:15.332
How can you do anything?

00:30:15.332 --> 00:30:21.502
It’s like telephoning somewhere without
having connection.

00:30:21.502 --> 00:30:32.402
You must be connected., first of all to the
Divine.( but this is not...ifficult thing.).

00:30:32.402 --> 00:30:35.872
In modern times is very easy.

00:30:35.872 --> 00:30:42.132
Formerly, it was, like you can say,...ree.

00:30:42.132 --> 00:30:46.002
In the beginning you get only one or two flowers.

00:30:46.002 --> 00:30:50.031
But the time has come.

00:30:50.031 --> 00:30:52.411
The blossom time has come.

00:30:52.411 --> 00:30:57.082
Already today,...ent to see William Blake’s
drawing exhibition.

00:30:57.082 --> 00:31:03.642
And he said, “All your sins and blasphemy
and everything will be forgiven.

00:31:03.642 --> 00:31:06.932
All your sins will be forgiven."

00:31:06.932 --> 00:31:10.552
He has said about these days.

00:31:10.552 --> 00:31:19.752
He said that the God of _____?

00:31:19.752 --> 00:31:34.442
will become prophets and they will have power
to convert and transform others into prophets.

00:31:34.442 --> 00:31:38.342
He has clearly prophesized about Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:38.342 --> 00:31:42.242
Every word he has said about it.

00:31:42.242 --> 00:31:45.032
But people don’t read Blake.

00:31:45.032 --> 00:31:46.712
If you go

00:31:46.712 --> 00:31:53.512
and see his exhibition, you’ll be surprised
how in the “Pilgrim’s Progress” only

00:31:53.512 --> 00:31:59.602
he has given clearly how you face life.

00:31:59.602 --> 00:32:06.972
And there are some Sahjaja Yogis here sitting
down at your back here.

00:32:06.972 --> 00:32:11.881
And they have come from London and some of
them from Australia.

00:32:11.881 --> 00:32:12.881
And they could see.

00:32:12.881 --> 00:32:14.742
This is how you face it.

00:32:14.742 --> 00:32:21.902
But to get realization is the easiest thing;
to maintain it...ather difficult.

00:32:21.902 --> 00:32:25.132
But also that is possible.

00:32:25.132 --> 00:32:37.492
Now we have in London (you will be surprised)...all
at least one and one-half times bigger than

00:32:37.492 --> 00:32:38.642
this.

00:32:38.642 --> 00:32:41.792
And the hall was completely filled.

00:32:41.792 --> 00:32:46.472
And they rose up to sing...ong of Jeruseleum
which was...reat experience for me to see

00:32:46.472 --> 00:32:47.472
that.

00:32:47.472 --> 00:32:54.032
But( you won’t believe)...tarted the work
in England because my husband got elected

00:32:54.032 --> 00:32:55.382
to...ost there.

00:32:55.382 --> 00:32:58.742
That’s how we were there.

00:32:58.742 --> 00:33:03.792
And in the beginning,...as working with seven
people...even hippies,...hould say...even

00:33:03.792 --> 00:33:05.482
people for four years.

00:33:05.482 --> 00:33:17.562
And now of course, in the whole of England
we have many centers and lots of people have

00:33:17.562 --> 00:33:21.582
got realization and they are working it out.

00:33:21.582 --> 00:33:24.742
It’s working out very well.

00:33:24.742 --> 00:33:31.062
We have some people here from there who have
come.

00:33:31.062 --> 00:33:32.062
Dr.

00:33:32.062 --> 00:33:36.122
David is here and Hesta is...arrister.

00:33:36.122 --> 00:33:40.512
Then we have these two from Australia...r.

00:33:40.512 --> 00:33:42.442
Warren, who was...iplomat.

00:33:42.442 --> 00:33:49.842
And these two are American girls...oth of
them...h Christine...as been with me since

00:33:49.842 --> 00:33:58.982
long and Marcia who got her realization only
two months back, but she was so upright and

00:33:58.982 --> 00:34:01.352
so straight forward.

00:34:01.352 --> 00:34:07.252
And you should know that it is you who should
decide.

00:34:07.252 --> 00:34:12.242
If you say...m your Guru, alright...ccept
it for the time being.

00:34:12.242 --> 00:34:17.771
But...other is always...uru.

00:34:17.771 --> 00:34:32.632
If you say that your mother had to teach you
so many things...lso...ave to teach you some

00:34:32.632 --> 00:34:33.632
things.

00:34:33.632 --> 00:34:43.072
But actually, it is you who is your own guru.

00:34:43.072 --> 00:34:44.661
You have to become it.

00:34:44.661 --> 00:34:50.432
Unless and until you are connected, how will
you judge?

00:34:50.432 --> 00:34:55.212
Once you get connected, you will be able to
check.

00:34:55.212 --> 00:35:05.982
But you don’t think it is...ental activity
that is going to bring you your realization.

00:35:05.982 --> 00:35:10.092
No, God has placed everything beautifully
within us...verything.

00:35:10.092 --> 00:35:20.631
You have got your Kundalini very nicely placed
in the sacrum bone.

00:35:20.631 --> 00:35:22.932
Now, see this bone.

00:35:22.932 --> 00:35:29.761
Sacrum is...riangular bone called “sacrum”
so that Greeks know about this bone.

00:35:29.761 --> 00:35:33.082
They knew it was...acred bone.

00:35:33.082 --> 00:35:35.332
Sacrum means sacred in Greek.

00:35:35.332 --> 00:35:37.131
When...ent to Greece,...as surprised.

00:35:37.131 --> 00:35:41.182
They have the complete idea of kundalini;
complete idea.

00:35:41.182 --> 00:35:46.702
And they have this Athena also...eans the
Primordial Mother.

00:35:46.702 --> 00:35:55.082
In Sanskrit language, Athena...thens comes
from that and the way She was holding...erpent

00:35:55.082 --> 00:36:05.472
in her hand and everything...bsolutely She
is the Primordial Kundalini.

00:36:05.472 --> 00:36:18.422
And the whole concept was there and when...ent
into the study of that...ried to find out

00:36:18.422 --> 00:36:20.222
what it was....

00:36:20.222 --> 00:36:22.631
how did they know?

00:36:22.631 --> 00:36:30.622
They said we had some Indo-Aryian groups coming
down here and they told us these things and

00:36:30.622 --> 00:36:32.992
that’s how they know about it.

00:36:32.992 --> 00:36:36.472
But, that was all lost

00:36:36.472 --> 00:36:44.432
because they brought all the Gods to the level
of human beings and made alot of mess out

00:36:44.432 --> 00:36:45.462
of it.

00:36:45.462 --> 00:36:53.192
Now we have to know that how Christ was such
an important incarnation on this earth.

00:36:53.192 --> 00:36:57.652
We have really made...ess of the whole thing.

00:36:57.652 --> 00:37:02.872
He said that you are to be born again.

00:37:02.872 --> 00:37:08.531
Actually, he came on this center where you
see this red mark.

00:37:08.531 --> 00:37:12.902
You see...t is placed in the optic chiasma.

00:37:12.902 --> 00:37:17.742
In the center is...ubtle center called as
Agnya chakra.

00:37:17.742 --> 00:37:22.272
In the Hindu scriptures, He is called as Mahavishnu.

00:37:22.272 --> 00:37:28.242
But...ill tell about His advent when He came
on this earth.

00:37:28.242 --> 00:37:33.662
We say, He is the gate; he is the door.

00:37:33.662 --> 00:37:41.212
He is the door below the limbic area.

00:37:41.212 --> 00:37:47.682
And the limbic area is the Kingdom of God.

00:37:47.682 --> 00:37:51.912
Where one has to center, the attention has
to enter.

00:37:51.912 --> 00:37:57.402
How you enter into it...ot bodily, but your
attention has to enter it.

00:37:57.402 --> 00:38:00.142
Your attention is apread out in this area.

00:38:00.142 --> 00:38:13.232
But not there...t has to enter through that
area into the limbic area and ultimately,

00:38:13.232 --> 00:38:16.661
is the fontanel area.

00:38:16.661 --> 00:38:29.742
It becomes soft and the kundalini has to come
out and with the cool breeze, this is your

00:38:29.742 --> 00:38:31.291
actual baptism.

00:38:31.291 --> 00:38:39.242
Is not the baptism you go to some theological
college to learn and say alright...

00:38:39.242 --> 00:38:40.391
baptize...t’s all artifical.

00:38:40.391 --> 00:38:41.552
It’s absolutely artificial.

00:38:41.552 --> 00:38:53.992
That’s not the way you can baptize.

00:38:53.992 --> 00:38:57.342
You have to be...ealized soul to do that.

00:38:57.342 --> 00:39:01.002
John the Baptist was...ealized soul.

00:39:01.002 --> 00:39:08.222
He was the one who knew how to do it.

00:39:08.222 --> 00:39:11.631
And he did it for all of them.

00:39:11.631 --> 00:39:14.682
And that’s how it should happen to you.

00:39:14.682 --> 00:39:17.772
The kundalini has to rise and give you realization.

00:39:17.772 --> 00:39:22.442
Now the Christ advent came at this point.

00:39:22.442 --> 00:39:29.342
It’s...ery important one because today we
have brought the charts and all that but tomorrow

00:39:29.342 --> 00:39:36.021
we’ll be giving you, in...ull way, how the
ego and super-ego are sucked.

00:39:36.021 --> 00:39:38.552
They create...arrier here.

00:39:38.552 --> 00:39:43.222
Our ego and super-ego gives us our I-ness.

00:39:43.222 --> 00:39:45.001
We get seperated.

00:39:45.001 --> 00:39:51.962
When He’s awakened, this portion gets opened
out and then the kundalini can rise.

00:39:51.962 --> 00:39:57.062
That’s why it is said, Christ is to be awakened
within you.

00:39:57.062 --> 00:40:02.422
But it can be only done by...erson with Divine
authority.

00:40:02.422 --> 00:40:03.781
And such...erson cannot live on your money.

00:40:03.781 --> 00:40:04.781
He cannot be...arasite.

00:40:04.781 --> 00:40:06.392
Such...erson has nothing to do wioth money.

00:40:06.392 --> 00:40:08.641
How can you purchase such...erson.?

00:40:08.641 --> 00:40:10.871
Such...erson is beyond....

00:40:10.871 --> 00:40:14.602
beyond your purchase...eyond your money.

00:40:14.602 --> 00:40:18.062
You cannot do anything for such...erson.

00:40:18.062 --> 00:40:20.082
Such...erson just gives.

00:40:20.082 --> 00:40:22.102
He just gives.

00:40:22.102 --> 00:40:23.102
He emits.

00:40:23.102 --> 00:40:26.142
It cannot take anything.

00:40:26.142 --> 00:40:27.142
It cannot receive.

00:40:27.142 --> 00:40:28.541
It cannot!

00:40:28.541 --> 00:40:32.781
You may try, but doesn’t.

00:40:32.781 --> 00:40:42.482
One day...as walking...ittle bit, my foot
was...ittle twisted and one of the doctors

00:40:42.482 --> 00:40:51.391
she said, “Alright Mother, I’ll try to
massage it."

00:40:51.391 --> 00:41:01.781
Yet she was relaxing that side and...as saying,
“What’s happening to you?”

00:41:01.781 --> 00:41:04.302
She said, “Mother, what is this?

00:41:04.302 --> 00:41:12.281
Lots of vibrations are coming and...m just
massaging yourself and...m massaging myself....

00:41:12.281 --> 00:41:21.371
the way it is cooling down and soothing."

00:41:21.371 --> 00:41:26.511
So, such...erson cannot take anythging from
you.

00:41:26.511 --> 00:41:34.041
Now, the most important point which...ould
like to reach you is this: that we don’t

00:41:34.041 --> 00:41:37.312
realize hos precariously we are placed otherwise,
also.

00:41:37.312 --> 00:41:45.371
There are equal and opposite forces working
on us.

00:41:45.371 --> 00:41:52.822
For example,...isease like cancer....as surprised
to hear at this country, theere are patients...ne

00:41:52.822 --> 00:42:00.202
among four...f cancer disease....ave told
this ten years back, that cancer can only

00:42:00.202 --> 00:42:03.131
be cured through Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:03.131 --> 00:42:18.952
There’s no other way out....ave cured many
cancer patients and you can also cure once

00:42:18.952 --> 00:42:19.952
you get realized.

00:42:19.952 --> 00:42:25.501
How it happens...ow you cure cancer...ll this
knowledte you can have...ree of charge.

00:42:25.501 --> 00:42:28.172
Free of this thing.

00:42:28.172 --> 00:42:33.052
Actually, first you must get your realization.

00:42:33.052 --> 00:42:40.391
Without that, there is no use telling you
because you come into this room; it is all

00:42:40.391 --> 00:42:45.901
dark; you are blind; you cannot see anything.

00:42:45.901 --> 00:42:54.901
What’s the use telling you the size of the
room, and color of the chairs, and color of

00:42:54.901 --> 00:42:56.411
all this?

00:42:56.411 --> 00:42:59.442
No use telling you.

00:42:59.442 --> 00:43:08.222
Best thing is to open the lights and open
your eyes so that you can see for yourself.

00:43:08.222 --> 00:43:14.261
And the complete knowledge becomes your own.

00:43:14.261 --> 00:43:17.021
Then is better to talk.

00:43:17.021 --> 00:43:22.992
Otherwise supposing even though when you can’t
see,...o on giving you the complete history

00:43:22.992 --> 00:43:24.411
about electricity and about everything.

00:43:24.411 --> 00:43:25.842
You’ll be bored and stiff.

00:43:25.842 --> 00:43:27.272
And its of no use.

00:43:27.272 --> 00:43:30.302
First thing is you must get your realization.

00:43:30.302 --> 00:43:32.442
That is the first thing.

00:43:32.442 --> 00:43:35.872
Cancer can easily be cured by Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:35.872 --> 00:43:38.012
Absolustely there is no doubt.

00:43:38.012 --> 00:43:43.212
And there cannot be another doubt that it
cannot be cured by anything else.

00:43:43.212 --> 00:43:51.212
In our body, we have...articular system called
as...ympathetic nervous system.

00:43:51.212 --> 00:43:59.802
How this sympathetic nervous system goes into...errible
tension when we go to extremes of any kind.

00:43:59.802 --> 00:44:00.802
Say smoking, for example.

00:44:00.802 --> 00:44:01.802
Now smoking is...ery interesting thing.

00:44:01.802 --> 00:44:06.352
According to me, this America is the Visshuddi
chakra....

00:44:06.352 --> 00:44:10.242
is the center of this çenter.

00:44:10.242 --> 00:44:17.041
This center gets spoiked when we smoke and
the smoking is the maximum here.

00:44:17.041 --> 00:44:22.602
Like the Europe is the liver and there people
drink.

00:44:22.602 --> 00:44:29.682
And they are so much in it and their lives
are the worst of all in Europe.

00:44:29.682 --> 00:44:31.021
England is the heart.

00:44:31.021 --> 00:44:34.332
It (England) is lethargic....ean the whole
thing is in such...ess that...on’t know

00:44:34.332 --> 00:44:35.332
what...ave to face.

00:44:35.332 --> 00:44:37.641
But...as happy to know that now the smoking
is going down.

00:44:37.641 --> 00:44:39.462
But with realization, smoking just disappears.

00:44:39.462 --> 00:44:42.502
You don’t have to work at it.

00:44:42.502 --> 00:44:44.511
Marsha herself used to smoke alot.

00:44:44.511 --> 00:44:45.781
She told me....as amazed.

00:44:45.781 --> 00:44:47.692
But she has biven up completely.

00:44:47.692 --> 00:44:52.372
Drugs and all those things drop out just like
something unnecessary because...ransformation

00:44:52.372 --> 00:44:53.372
takes place.

00:44:53.372 --> 00:44:55.922
And the transmutation starts...hen the transmutation
starts, all these things drop out.

00:44:55.922 --> 00:45:01.082
You enjoy the best of health...est of your
heart...est of your miond....

00:45:01.082 --> 00:45:03.952
and your emotions come out.

00:45:03.952 --> 00:45:07.857
The best part of it is that this is what one
has to achieve....

00:45:07.857 --> 00:45:11.462
the whole humanity has to achieve.

00:45:11.462 --> 00:45:19.982
But the few who are the seekers have to do
it first.

00:45:19.982 --> 00:45:23.382
They have to do it first; they are the foundation.

00:45:23.382 --> 00:45:28.472
Like in every evolution, only...ew fishes
had to come out; then many came

00:45:28.472 --> 00:45:29.472
out.

00:45:29.472 --> 00:45:32.192
In the same way, few people have to do it.

00:45:32.192 --> 00:45:33.891
I’m happy there are...ew today.

00:45:33.891 --> 00:45:37.962
Though others are disappointed,...m not....m
happy because I’ll have to work harder.

00:45:37.962 --> 00:45:40.822
If there are too many, maybe difficult.

00:45:40.822 --> 00:45:46.651
As he said, it’s true that...ave realization
to six thousand people in...illage in India.

00:45:46.651 --> 00:45:48.082
But they are not complicated.

00:45:48.082 --> 00:45:49.522
See, they aren’t so complicated.

00:45:49.522 --> 00:45:56.651
They don’t live with the sorrows (word?)
you have here or the tensions you have....

00:45:56.651 --> 00:45:58.602
or the litigations you have....

00:45:58.602 --> 00:46:01.962
the problems you have....ave seen Indians
who have come here to earn money.

00:46:01.962 --> 00:46:05.552
They have all gone off their heads....ean
really, they have become half crazy.

00:46:05.552 --> 00:46:09.071
The gentleman with whom...m now putting up,
he told me already so many Indians have been

00:46:09.071 --> 00:46:10.071
under litigation.

00:46:10.071 --> 00:46:11.992
This happened, that happened and all kinds
of tensions are building up.

00:46:11.992 --> 00:46:15.172
Here, despite all our modern vest(word?) we
also have landed ourselves into terrible tensions

00:46:15.172 --> 00:46:18.241
of this machinery; this machinate and all
that.

00:46:18.241 --> 00:46:20.842
The villagers in India are extremely simple
people.

00:46:20.842 --> 00:46:23.072
They lead an extremely simple life.

00:46:23.072 --> 00:46:27.512
They have no complications....on’t say that
it would be so easy here as the way they have

00:46:27.512 --> 00:46:28.512
got realization.

00:46:28.512 --> 00:46:30.142
Of course, one has to work hard.

00:46:30.142 --> 00:46:35.782
Like we had about seven people....ad all of
them...t took about three hours to get realization.

00:46:35.782 --> 00:46:38.392
So, it could be that way also.

00:46:38.392 --> 00:46:41.912
It cannot be guaranteed; it cannot be promised.

00:46:41.912 --> 00:46:43.672
It cannot be certified.

00:46:43.672 --> 00:46:48.742
It has to happen...s the main point...s the
happening...s the happening.

00:46:48.742 --> 00:46:50.252
You have to become.

00:46:50.252 --> 00:46:52.132
It has to be actualized.

00:46:52.132 --> 00:46:55.581
It is not to be believed.

00:46:55.581 --> 00:46:59.061
That’s what you should know.

00:46:59.061 --> 00:47:02.362
If you are honest, you are to prove.

00:47:02.362 --> 00:47:06.301
And, you want to have it, you’ll get it.

00:47:06.301 --> 00:47:08.262
I’ll work very hard.

00:47:08.262 --> 00:47:13.841
It’s you who has to have patience with yourself....ave
all the patience and love.

00:47:13.841 --> 00:47:15.742
No doubt about it.

00:47:15.742 --> 00:47:20.581
But you all have to have patience....old you
seven people...as working for four years.

00:47:20.581 --> 00:47:26.512
Suppose its not going to be that bad, because
with them...orked out many permutations and

00:47:26.512 --> 00:47:27.512
combinations.

00:47:27.512 --> 00:47:32.482
Now,...now all the permutations and combinations
that are really harmful to people and how

00:47:32.482 --> 00:47:33.682
they are eradicated.

00:47:33.682 --> 00:47:36.882
But still...ould say...ould still have to
study some American complications which...o

00:47:36.882 --> 00:47:37.882
not know.

00:47:37.882 --> 00:47:44.331
Nine years back, people were simpler people
here and they are all mostly have gone away

00:47:44.331 --> 00:47:50.122
or also at that time the same thing is that...ould
not contact and everything works on money.

00:47:50.122 --> 00:47:56.132
You see you have to give them money so they
publisize you.

00:47:56.132 --> 00:47:59.942
Then they publisize you...hen you get more
money.

00:47:59.942 --> 00:48:04.222
Here there is no question of money, you see.

00:48:04.222 --> 00:48:12.052
You see my whole basic thing is you have to
get real people so the real thing, without

00:48:12.052 --> 00:48:13.052
money.

00:48:13.052 --> 00:48:17.842
And then, you cannot have...ig circus; you
cannot have...ig thing and it has to be started

00:48:17.842 --> 00:48:18.862
in...enuine way...n...eal way.

00:48:18.862 --> 00:48:24.612
They asked me that there is, there are agencies
who work out all these tings....aid to begin

00:48:24.612 --> 00:48:25.612
with...on’t think that

00:48:25.612 --> 00:48:26.612
this is important.

00:48:26.612 --> 00:48:28.682
We should work it out.

00:48:28.682 --> 00:48:29.682
Let’s see.

00:48:29.682 --> 00:48:34.122
There will be some people who feel attracted
and come.

00:48:34.122 --> 00:48:37.652
And let’s work it out this way.

00:48:37.652 --> 00:48:46.012
Still,...ould like your advice as to where
we can go, when, and in...ecent manner whenever

00:48:46.012 --> 00:48:47.012
we can advertise.

00:48:47.012 --> 00:48:53.782
Just now...ady told us that if you go to these
shops it will be good idea.

00:48:53.782 --> 00:48:55.922
We would like to invite people for this experience.

00:48:55.922 --> 00:48:56.922
This is your right.

00:48:56.922 --> 00:49:04.962
You are seekers and just like...ank, you have
got your bank accounts and you just cash it.

00:49:04.962 --> 00:49:15.442
And these are lots of places also.

00:49:15.442 --> 00:49:28.912
And whatever mistakes are done, don’t worry
about it.

00:49:28.912 --> 00:49:35.732
One of the big problems...aced in Englad is
that they all suffer from...enter or left

00:49:35.732 --> 00:49:37.932
visshuddi which comes out of guilt.

00:49:37.932 --> 00:49:39.532
You see, they are guilty all the time.

00:49:39.532 --> 00:49:42.912
Maybe Catholicism that makes them feel guilty,
but it’s...ery, very common trouble with

00:49:42.912 --> 00:49:43.912
them.

00:49:43.912 --> 00:49:44.912
They all the time feel guilty.

00:49:44.912 --> 00:49:46.301
Now, what are you feeling guilty for?

00:49:46.301 --> 00:49:47.301
We must suffer.

00:49:47.301 --> 00:49:48.301
Why?

00:49:48.301 --> 00:49:49.301
Why should you suffer?

00:49:49.301 --> 00:49:50.301
Christ has suffered for you.

00:49:50.301 --> 00:49:51.872
Did he leave anything for you to suffer?

00:49:51.872 --> 00:49:54.032
We whould be guilty about what?

00:49:54.032 --> 00:49:55.472
Why are you guilty?

00:49:55.472 --> 00:49:58.352
I’m talking of ocean of compassion...cean
of love.

00:49:58.352 --> 00:50:00.512
Now what guilt can you have?

00:50:00.512 --> 00:50:04.182
And is...ery big mistake to think that we
have done little mistake here and little mistake

00:50:04.182 --> 00:50:05.182
there.

00:50:05.182 --> 00:50:06.592
God has to save this creation.

00:50:06.592 --> 00:50:10.682
It is He who has to come in compassion and
has to do something about it.

00:50:10.682 --> 00:50:13.982
If He doesn’t save you, his creation is
lost.

00:50:13.982 --> 00:50:17.862
You shouldn’t feel like that inb...mall
way.

00:50:17.862 --> 00:50:23.202
It’s all very childish,...ould say, like...hild
to feel “Oow” after this mistake.

00:50:23.202 --> 00:50:41.071
But no...our Father is so great, is so full
of love you have to just look at Him and He’ll

00:50:41.071 --> 00:50:45.482
work it out.

00:50:45.482 --> 00:50:48.702
You should forgive yourself; that is one of
the things...ould request of you.

00:50:48.702 --> 00:50:52.742
First of all, before forgiving anybody else,
you must forgive yourself.

00:50:52.742 --> 00:50:56.612
That is the first thing you have to do before
realization.

00:50:56.612 --> 00:51:00.112
Of course, in one lecture,...annot tell you
much about it.

00:51:00.112 --> 00:51:02.222
This is just an introductory lecture.

00:51:02.222 --> 00:51:10.622
And we haven’t got our charts and all that
because first day, if you start seeing the

00:51:10.622 --> 00:51:14.272
charts, you (word?) mechanical and you think
it’s some sort of...omputer.

00:51:14.272 --> 00:51:15.602
You work it out.

00:51:15.602 --> 00:51:16.912
Actually, you are...omputer, you become...ivine
computer.

00:51:16.912 --> 00:51:20.402
But that’s...ifferent system and so it’s
better that we talk about it just now.

00:51:20.402 --> 00:51:23.722
And you get your realization; work it out.

00:51:23.722 --> 00:51:31.452
We are going to be here for some time and...ope
you’ll be able to follow my lectures and

00:51:31.452 --> 00:51:33.192
follow the whole thing.

00:51:33.192 --> 00:51:37.012
It’s such...remendous thing....ust tell
you about this in five hundred...00...ectures

00:51:37.012 --> 00:51:39.142
in London...t least...inimum....ay that every
time...peak.

00:51:39.142 --> 00:51:41.832
They say, “Mother, you are speaking something
now."

00:51:41.832 --> 00:51:45.192
So, you can imagine how much knowledge there
is there.

00:51:45.192 --> 00:51:47.932
But you are knowledge; you become knowledge
yourself.

00:51:47.932 --> 00:51:50.801
In Australia, the newspaper people were very
good to me because there was some happening....ady

00:51:50.801 --> 00:51:52.432
was very seriously ill

00:51:52.432 --> 00:52:01.212
and she had some sort of...ery serious stroke
and...riend of hers was...ig man at the newspapers

00:52:01.212 --> 00:52:05.922
and one of the Sahaja Yoginis there gave my
photograph to her.

00:52:05.922 --> 00:52:09.422
And she did get well from that...rom the photograph
only.

00:52:09.422 --> 00:52:16.802
So, this man started thinking about it and
then they did...ig publicity for me.

00:52:16.802 --> 00:52:26.512
So, it was lucky ,I should say, for Australians
and...as there for about one month or so...hree

00:52:26.512 --> 00:52:27.512
weeks.

00:52:27.512 --> 00:52:30.472
And we got thousands there now...housands.

00:52:30.472 --> 00:52:36.392
There are seven cities where we have seven
centers.

00:52:36.392 --> 00:52:42.212
It has worked....ust say, Australians are
very good for realization.

00:52:42.212 --> 00:52:49.712
It was surprising because certain people got
realization and settled down and they knew

00:52:49.712 --> 00:52:51.851
it was the trugh.

00:52:51.851 --> 00:52:54.832
That was the thing.

00:52:54.832 --> 00:53:00.071
YTou have to be intelligent enough to see
what i8s the truth.

00:53:00.071 --> 00:53:01.902
Don’t allow your intelligence to cheat you.

00:53:01.902 --> 00:53:04.242
Be careful about your intelligence...lso,
it can cheat you.

00:53:04.242 --> 00:53:07.862
But you should be really sharp about it to
see what is the truth.

00:53:07.862 --> 00:53:09.772
And wise.

00:53:09.772 --> 00:53:16.722
And that is what you are going to have.

00:53:16.722 --> 00:53:32.581
Now,...ould request you to ask me questions
because you see you all must be having lots

00:53:32.581 --> 00:53:33.581
of questions.

00:53:33.581 --> 00:53:39.402
You have your mind and you should better ask
because...on’t want whild we are giving

00:53:39.402 --> 00:53:47.732
you realization that you should feel that,
“Oh,...idn’t ask this question to Mother,”...though

00:53:47.732 --> 00:53:52.962
this makes no difference whether you ask me
questions or not.

00:53:52.962 --> 00:53:54.412
It is...ery different thing.

00:53:54.412 --> 00:53:56.702
It is beyond your mind.

00:53:56.702 --> 00:54:00.561
You go beyond your mind.

00:54:00.561 --> 00:54:05.972
You go beyond your mind; beyond your ego;
beyond your super-ego.

00:54:05.972 --> 00:54:08.032
You become something else.

00:54:08.032 --> 00:54:12.202
So if you have any questions, you can ask.

00:54:12.202 --> 00:54:23.422
Question: There are many people who come offering
realization.

00:54:23.422 --> 00:54:29.252
You come offering realization....ould like
to know something about this.

00:54:29.252 --> 00:54:45.982
In other words, you have something unique
to offer, is that right?

00:54:45.982 --> 00:54:58.041
Yes, of course...ould say...on’t know how
many have come here and how many have been

00:54:58.041 --> 00:55:01.262
thugs and how many have been real.

00:55:01.262 --> 00:55:06.082
But, actually most of them have been thugs
only because what they offer you...

00:55:06.082 --> 00:55:07.082
don’t know...

00:55:07.082 --> 00:55:10.432
have had people from other gurus...ll kinds
of gurus you see.

00:55:10.432 --> 00:55:13.032
And there are one or two sitting here.

00:55:13.032 --> 00:55:15.962
All of them have been to someone or something
like that.

00:55:15.962 --> 00:55:19.452
Now as...old you, the uniqueness of Sahaja
Yoga is this: Sahaja means...Saha” is with;

00:55:19.452 --> 00:55:20.882
“ja” is born...s born with you....

00:55:20.882 --> 00:55:22.422
is your own....

00:55:22.422 --> 00:55:23.762
within you.

00:55:23.762 --> 00:55:28.182
Now the uniqueness about it is this: that
it is what you are seeking.

00:55:28.182 --> 00:55:33.892
That’s what you are going to get....

00:55:33.892 --> 00:55:39.962
is your spirit....

00:55:39.962 --> 00:55:44.122
is that you become that...s the uniqueness.

00:55:44.122 --> 00:55:47.652
It’s not that...an say there is...ourse
of

00:55:47.652 --> 00:55:54.722
ten days...ou go through the course or you
pay for say...umping course or...o-called

00:55:54.722 --> 00:55:58.742
flying course or something like that.

00:55:58.742 --> 00:56:00.732
It is what you are.

00:56:00.732 --> 00:56:01.932
You become that.

00:56:01.932 --> 00:56:08.272
The uniqueness of it is that it’s...appening
which is...iving happening.

00:56:08.272 --> 00:56:15.402
You see, we don’t do anything that is...iving
work.

00:56:15.402 --> 00:56:19.362
What we do is...ead work.

00:56:19.362 --> 00:56:28.072
Like...ree died; we make chairs; we think
we have achieved alot.

00:56:28.072 --> 00:56:33.712
You see this wall is all made of dead things,
isn’t it?

00:56:33.712 --> 00:56:36.602
We have just changed the form.

00:56:36.602 --> 00:56:39.442
And these forms actually try to dominate us.

00:56:39.442 --> 00:56:44.452
This chair becomes...ort of an obsession for
us because we can’t sit on the ground....

00:56:44.452 --> 00:56:46.142
this...e have to use...hair like that.

00:56:46.142 --> 00:56:49.782
Now, anything that we do is all dead.

00:56:49.782 --> 00:56:52.662
Supposing somebody has to jump.

00:56:52.662 --> 00:56:57.852
Anybody can jump., What is there to be jumping?

00:56:57.852 --> 00:57:00.732
People pay money to jump.

00:57:00.732 --> 00:57:05.342
Can you imagine?...o take off clothes?...eople
pay money.

00:57:05.342 --> 00:57:07.652
How can that be?

00:57:07.652 --> 00:57:09.722
What is so great about it?

00:57:09.722 --> 00:57:12.212
We must understand: what do we become?

00:57:12.212 --> 00:57:13.992
What powers do we become?

00:57:13.992 --> 00:57:14.992
You see, there’s...uru.

00:57:14.992 --> 00:57:16.142
He says, “Alright,...ive you some knowledge."

00:57:16.142 --> 00:57:17.712
Now, what knowledge has he got?

00:57:17.712 --> 00:57:18.872
One gentleman came.

00:57:18.872 --> 00:57:21.182
He said, “I’ve already got knowledge."

00:57:21.182 --> 00:57:23.502
...aid, “What knowledge do you have?”

00:57:23.502 --> 00:57:26.262
For example, Warren can tell you where is
your chakra catching.

00:57:26.262 --> 00:57:31.642
Where is your kundalini; where it is obstructed;
how to raise it; how to bring it us; how to

00:57:31.642 --> 00:57:32.762
take it down.

00:57:32.762 --> 00:57:35.392
The he can cure patients.

00:57:35.392 --> 00:57:37.992
He must have cured...

00:57:37.992 --> 00:57:40.591
don’t know how many.

00:57:40.591 --> 00:57:45.101
You all can cure patientes and knowingly...hat
it is.

00:57:45.101 --> 00:57:47.841
What chakra is catching...hat is happening...hat
is the mental process.

00:57:47.841 --> 00:57:51.782
Everything, you know in your awareness.

00:57:51.782 --> 00:57:57.252
You become...ifferent person...s...ransformation
that takes place.

00:57:57.252 --> 00:57:58.802
You become master of yourself.

00:57:58.802 --> 00:58:00.882
To explain,...ill tell you...ery simple anology.

00:58:00.882 --> 00:58:02.622
Say we are traveling by....

00:58:02.622 --> 00:58:05.402
we are trying to learn how to drive.

00:58:05.402 --> 00:58:13.922
Now you have got an accelerator and you have
got...rake.

00:58:13.922 --> 00:58:16.302
You’re working it out.

00:58:16.302 --> 00:58:31.762
You see one, then another....e have two centers...wo
channels within us which...how tomorrow...ne

00:58:31.762 --> 00:58:33.862
for our actions.)

00:58:33.862 --> 00:58:43.762
So we start working both of these and start
managing.

00:58:43.762 --> 00:58:47.502
We go to extremes....

00:58:47.502 --> 00:58:59.922
this way...hat way...nd make all kinds of
mistakes...hatever it is...ut we try to balance

00:58:59.922 --> 00:59:00.922
ourselves.

00:59:00.922 --> 00:59:05.742
When do we learn the car driving?

00:59:05.742 --> 00:59:08.652
When we learn it.

00:59:08.652 --> 00:59:13.732
Once you have done that there the Master is...itting
at the back.

00:59:13.732 --> 00:59:19.742
And once He sees you have balanced it, He
gives you your place.

00:59:19.742 --> 00:59:23.182
You become the master of your being.

00:59:23.182 --> 00:59:25.182
This is what has to happen....

00:59:25.182 --> 00:59:26.182
the breakthrough!

00:59:26.182 --> 00:59:27.862
The breakthrough has to take place.

00:59:27.862 --> 00:59:34.382
Is not just...ake believe that, “Oh, we
have become like this."

00:59:34.382 --> 00:59:39.982
...ean there are people who believe they are
self realized.

00:59:39.982 --> 00:59:45.091
There are many like that, you see, that believe
that they are that.

00:59:45.091 --> 00:59:46.232
They are not.

00:59:46.232 --> 00:59:48.922
Because they should be able to tell.

00:59:48.922 --> 00:59:50.831
They should become collectively conscious.

00:59:50.831 --> 00:59:54.262
They should be able to tell where is the kundalini;
where is the problem.

00:59:54.262 --> 00:59:55.262
Now, for

00:59:55.262 --> 00:59:56.601
example, you are sitting....

00:59:56.601 --> 01:00:02.841
alright, now you do not know about the gentleman
next to you...here is the problem?

01:00:02.841 --> 01:00:04.601
Where is his kundalini?

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:06.831
You cannot give him realization.

01:00:06.831 --> 01:00:22.132
But the people who are realized souls...ven
the small children...an do it...ery small

01:00:22.132 --> 01:00:23.262
children.

01:00:23.262 --> 01:00:30.712
They will immediately say, “This is the
center catching.

01:00:30.712 --> 01:00:35.512
Here...he finger...ittle children will show
the same finger.

01:00:35.512 --> 01:00:40.882
For example, if you have...roblem, say on
this center.

01:00:40.882 --> 01:00:41.882
Alright.

01:00:41.882 --> 01:00:47.541
All the children you put some sort of...hing
to close their eyes.

01:00:47.541 --> 01:00:50.452
And ask them, “Which center is catching?”

01:00:50.452 --> 01:00:52.112
They’ll all say this.

01:00:52.112 --> 01:00:54.152
All will say the same thing.

01:00:54.152 --> 01:00:57.172
And they also know how to correct this.

01:00:57.172 --> 01:01:00.192
Little, little children know how to correct
this.

01:01:00.192 --> 01:01:04.472
They are born realized and born realized children
are dynamic.

01:01:04.472 --> 01:01:09.742
And they know...o many born-realized children
are born these days.

01:01:09.742 --> 01:01:13.212
How will you know whether they are born realized
children?

01:01:13.212 --> 01:01:17.992
You do not know who is...alse guru and who
is...eal guru.

01:01:17.992 --> 01:01:19.791
You don’t know anything!

01:01:19.791 --> 01:01:21.581
There’s no discrimination power.

01:01:21.581 --> 01:01:29.031
But, if you want to know also about that,
you can just put the hands towards them and

01:01:29.031 --> 01:01:32.051
they can find out.

01:01:32.051 --> 01:01:35.831
Your vibrations will vanish completely.

01:01:35.831 --> 01:01:41.112
You’ll have heat coming from horrible gurus.

01:01:41.112 --> 01:01:51.422
If you see any horrible guru, you’ll find
very bad vibrations coming in that...ll burning

01:01:51.422 --> 01:01:56.002
and some of them just stop the vibrations.

01:01:56.002 --> 01:01:59.922
You just don’t get any vibrations from them.

01:01:59.922 --> 01:02:04.682
You can make it out from everyone what sort
of...erson he is.

01:02:04.682 --> 01:02:06.672
For example, there are athiests who don’t
believe in God.

01:02:06.672 --> 01:02:07.672
Alright.

01:02:07.672 --> 01:02:12.432
Now when they get realization they can ask
the question, “Is there God?”

01:02:12.432 --> 01:02:13.791
Tremendous vibrations.

01:02:13.791 --> 01:02:23.311
To find out relatively, we can say, take three
people...ne from...uru who’s horrid, one

01:02:23.311 --> 01:02:28.882
from...unatic asylum, and one who’s...ealized
soul, according to us.

01:02:28.882 --> 01:02:29.882
Alright?

01:02:29.882 --> 01:02:31.522
Now you put themn together.

01:02:31.522 --> 01:02:37.892
You’ll find the one who’s from the guru,
maybe feeling hot...ery hot...r may not get

01:02:37.892 --> 01:02:39.321
realization at all...aybe frozen...nything.

01:02:39.321 --> 01:02:43.321
The one from lunatic asylum may feel hot...orrible...ut
he may get well...e may get realization.

01:02:43.321 --> 01:02:45.992
And the third person, who is the one who is...ealized
soul will get only...ool breeze.

01:02:45.992 --> 01:02:47.992
We have cured many people who are meantally
like that...any have been cured...ou can cure

01:02:47.992 --> 01:02:48.992
also.

01:02:48.992 --> 01:02:49.992
It is you who become that...s the point.

01:02:49.992 --> 01:02:50.992
You become that...t’s your right.

01:02:50.992 --> 01:02:51.992
You have been seeking all your lives.

01:02:51.992 --> 01:02:52.992
Actually, it is impossible to believe that
there could be someone who does it just for

01:02:52.992 --> 01:02:53.992
loves sake.

01:02:53.992 --> 01:03:01.041
You can’t believe itr because it’s so
money oriented...he whole thing is so money

01:03:01.041 --> 01:03:02.041
oriented....

01:03:02.041 --> 01:03:04.101
that we can’t believe it.

01:03:04.101 --> 01:03:12.002
Even our parents; we think they love us for
money....ean, it has gone to that limit of

01:03:12.002 --> 01:03:13.002
absurdity.

01:03:13.002 --> 01:03:14.652
But God is l,ove and love is there.

01:03:14.652 --> 01:03:16.972
Ånd in his love everyone should do it.

01:03:16.972 --> 01:03:17.972
It has to happen.

01:03:17.972 --> 01:03:18.972
Any other questions?

01:03:18.972 --> 01:03:19.972
Question: (A woman asks where the other public
meeting will be).

01:03:19.972 --> 01:03:20.972
(Warren says he’ll make an announcement
later)

01:03:20.972 --> 01:03:21.972
Mother: You see, all of us have got it and
we’ll give all that to you and you’ll

01:03:21.972 --> 01:03:22.972
come along to those lectures and you will
help us to bring...

01:03:22.972 --> 01:03:24.801
(you see actually we do not know how to meet
the seekers.

01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:27.811
That’s the main point with us.

01:03:27.811 --> 01:03:31.192
And we don’t need anything else.

01:03:31.192 --> 01:03:32.821
Like the lady offered...lso.

01:03:32.821 --> 01:03:33.862
We don’t need it.

01:03:33.862 --> 01:03:35.172
We don’t need any money.

01:03:35.172 --> 01:03:36.172
We have everything.

01:03:36.172 --> 01:03:37.172
We have no problem.

01:03:37.172 --> 01:03:38.172
And no money...othing.

01:03:38.172 --> 01:03:42.152
We have got places to live in and we have
no problem of any kind.

01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:44.041
What we want...e have also got halls and everything
and we don’t need anything.

01:03:44.041 --> 01:03:45.956
But what we want...hat we want...eekers to
come down and you have to suggest how to get

01:03:45.956 --> 01:03:47.162
them; that’s all.

01:03:47.162 --> 01:03:48.372
(Announcements of meetings)

01:03:48.372 --> 01:03:49.372
Question:...

01:03:49.372 --> 01:03:54.522
lady asks for Mother’s comment on somebody
but asks Her not to judge.)

01:03:54.522 --> 01:03:56.002
Mother: No,...ave to.

01:03:56.002 --> 01:03:57.492
I’m sorry,...ave to.

01:03:57.492 --> 01:04:01.702
You see, it’s very good of you to say that...hould
not make comment(word?).

01:04:01.702 --> 01:04:02.702
But...ave to.

01:04:02.702 --> 01:04:03.702
I’m sorry.

01:04:03.702 --> 01:04:04.762
Because you see,...an’t bear to see the
way their kundalini’s have gone down.

01:04:04.762 --> 01:04:07.862
The connection has to be.

01:04:07.862 --> 01:04:12.212
You see, when Christ was criticizing them,
they said the same thing to him.

01:04:12.212 --> 01:04:16.212
“Why should you criticize them?

01:04:16.212 --> 01:04:18.472
They don’t critisize you?”

01:04:18.472 --> 01:04:29.382
So He said, “The Satanic are not going to
speak against the Satanic."

01:04:29.382 --> 01:04:30.512
That’s what it is.

01:04:30.512 --> 01:04:36.922
You do not know how serious it is.

01:04:36.922 --> 01:04:50.262
When you will know, you will be amazed.

01:04:50.262 --> 01:05:00.091
You do not know how serious it is and that’s
shy you are saying that.

01:05:00.091 --> 01:05:03.031
Once you find out shy...m saying this.

01:05:03.031 --> 01:05:07.932
You see, it is not easy to say anything against
these people.

01:05:07.932 --> 01:05:09.022
It’s not easy.

01:05:09.022 --> 01:05:12.781
Bust none of them...

01:05:12.781 --> 01:05:29.512
have said about them...ach one of them about
l0 years back...penly...bout each one of them...ho

01:05:29.512 --> 01:05:31.902
they are.

01:05:31.902 --> 01:05:42.712
Nobody has even tried to even bring any suit
or any law suit against me.

01:05:42.712 --> 01:05:45.942
And whatever is wrong,...ave to say that.

01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:47.482
I’m sorry, my child.

01:05:47.482 --> 01:05:51.062
You see, this is not...hing where you can
allow Satanic things to happen.

01:05:51.062 --> 01:05:52.062
We have to discriminate.

01:05:52.062 --> 01:05:53.062
You will know yourself.

01:05:53.062 --> 01:05:54.062
You cannot love...nake like that.

01:05:54.062 --> 01:05:55.722
You must know...nake is...nake and...uman
being is...uman being.

01:05:55.722 --> 01:05:56.722
Everybody has his own values.

01:05:56.722 --> 01:05:59.002
You see,...m not here going to be angry with
you for that.

01:05:59.002 --> 01:06:02.002
But...m angry with them!...ith all of them...efinitely.

01:06:02.002 --> 01:06:04.702
You do not...ou just wait and see.

01:06:04.702 --> 01:06:07.851
You yourself will be so angry.

01:06:07.851 --> 01:06:09.432
I’ll show you.

01:06:09.432 --> 01:06:13.112
Say,...irl who came from one of them...hugs.

01:06:13.112 --> 01:06:14.682
She was epileptic.

01:06:14.682 --> 01:06:16.782
Her daughter was epileptic.

01:06:16.782 --> 01:06:18.892
Her husband was epileptic.

01:06:18.892 --> 01:06:20.462
She was...randdaughter of...uke.

01:06:20.462 --> 01:06:23.612
She had lost all her money.

01:06:23.612 --> 01:06:26.242
They had sold their house.

01:06:26.242 --> 01:06:28.872
They were on the streets.

01:06:28.872 --> 01:06:29.872
Absolutely.

01:06:29.872 --> 01:06:30.982
And she is...eeker!

01:06:30.982 --> 01:06:33.792
If you are...ohter, what would you say to
that?

01:06:33.792 --> 01:06:36.101
You will say they are very nice people?

01:06:36.101 --> 01:06:37.202
You will go and garland them?

01:06:37.202 --> 01:06:38.202
Not one, but I’ll show you thousands of
them.

01:06:38.202 --> 01:06:40.652
Here we have cases who have come.

01:06:40.652 --> 01:06:42.032
She is Hesta...itting here.

01:06:42.032 --> 01:06:43.032
You just ask her.

01:06:43.032 --> 01:06:44.032
How much she was harmed!

01:06:44.032 --> 01:06:45.032
How she was harmed.

01:06:45.032 --> 01:06:46.032
She would have been dead!

01:06:46.032 --> 01:06:47.032
Do you think...hould say they are nice people?

01:06:47.032 --> 01:06:48.032
Apart from anything else, they spoil your
chances of realization.

01:06:48.032 --> 01:06:49.032
I am not here for votes or anything.

01:06:49.032 --> 01:06:50.032
Why should...ry to please them?...ave to tell
the truth, if you don’t mind....ave to tell.

01:06:50.032 --> 01:06:51.032
Question: Oh, then...ould just like to ask,
what about people that are doing chakra therapy

01:06:51.032 --> 01:06:52.032
and they charge very high prices?

01:06:52.032 --> 01:06:57.402
Maybe they are not high prices and they help
people and yet people don’t have that kind

01:06:57.402 --> 01:07:04.122
of money....ould like to ask you, what do
you think about people who do chakra therapy

01:07:04.122 --> 01:07:05.122
and charge fees?

01:07:05.122 --> 01:07:06.122
Mother:...on’t know what sort of...

01:07:06.122 --> 01:07:07.122
(word?)

01:07:07.122 --> 01:07:08.122
make believes.

01:07:08.122 --> 01:07:09.122
How can you have any kind of chakra thearpy
without realization?

01:07:09.122 --> 01:07:10.122
It’s all make believe.

01:07:10.122 --> 01:07:11.122
You blieve all this nonsensical people.

01:07:11.122 --> 01:07:12.122
What am...o do now?

01:07:12.122 --> 01:07:13.122
Why do you believe them?

01:07:13.122 --> 01:07:14.122
You see chakra therapy,...ean...on’t know...n
ordinary Indian can understand.

01:07:14.122 --> 01:07:15.122
Only...aint can do it.

01:07:15.122 --> 01:07:16.122
He has to be...aint.

01:07:16.122 --> 01:07:17.122
How can he charge money?...aint will not take...ie
from you.

01:07:17.122 --> 01:07:18.122
It is...imple thing, try to understand that.

01:07:18.122 --> 01:07:19.122
Question: Well,...lways thought that, but
this is America.

01:07:19.122 --> 01:07:20.122
Chakra therapy is...ew thing, I’ve heard...laugh)
(woman keeps telling her story)

01:07:20.122 --> 01:07:21.122
Mother:...ell you that.

01:07:21.122 --> 01:07:22.122
What is it.

01:07:22.122 --> 01:07:23.122
You might get...emporary help.

01:07:23.122 --> 01:07:24.122
No doubt about it.

01:07:24.122 --> 01:07:25.122
You can get...emporary help.

01:07:25.122 --> 01:07:26.122
You see, now you are bringing into controversies
so...ave to tell you about it.

01:07:26.122 --> 01:07:27.122
But you don’t mind it.

01:07:27.122 --> 01:07:28.122
What heppens within us, we have some stored
energies in the chakras, alright?

01:07:28.122 --> 01:07:29.122
And, like acupuncture, is also...s not to
be done by someone who is not...ealized soul.

01:07:29.122 --> 01:07:30.122
Is to be done only by realized souls.

01:07:30.122 --> 01:07:31.122
If acupuncture is done by someone who is not...ealized
soul...

01:07:31.122 --> 01:07:32.122
mean it’s against Zen (?).

01:07:32.122 --> 01:07:33.122
It’s against.

01:07:33.122 --> 01:07:34.122
You have to be...word ?),...ean people don’t
read about it....usha (word ?) means...ealized

01:07:34.122 --> 01:07:35.122
soul.

01:07:35.122 --> 01:07:36.122
If you are not...ealized soul, you are not
supposed to do it.

01:07:36.122 --> 01:07:37.122
Now, this one also...hakra therapy...hat you
can do is to work on the sympathetic nervous

01:07:37.122 --> 01:07:38.122
system.

01:07:38.122 --> 01:07:39.122
Now the sympathetic nervous system, you can
pull out the little energy that you have,

01:07:39.122 --> 01:07:40.122
but you develop other problems with it.

01:07:40.122 --> 01:07:41.122
Sahaja Yoga is...hing by which you get open
to the all pervading power....ll the time

01:07:41.122 --> 01:07:42.122
flowing within us.

01:07:42.122 --> 01:08:06.291
You have to open yourslf to that universal
being within your heart...hich is the spirit.

01:08:06.291 --> 01:08:07.922
You don’t have to sort of lessen energy
here and energy there and energy there.

01:08:07.922 --> 01:08:08.922
You don’t have to take that energy out.

01:08:08.922 --> 01:08:09.922
But the energy from the above comes in.

01:08:09.922 --> 01:08:10.922
Like grace, it flows.

01:08:10.922 --> 01:08:11.922
And that’s how always such things can lead
into terrible problems...ental problems....

01:08:11.922 --> 01:08:12.922
all kinds of things.

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:13.922
Supposing you try to treat somebody mentally....

01:08:13.922 --> 01:08:14.922
then you extract the physical energy.

01:08:14.922 --> 01:08:15.922
Then the person will suffer physically.

01:08:15.922 --> 01:08:16.922
You see, this

01:08:16.922 --> 01:08:17.922
stored energy for...articular chakra, which...ill
explain to you...verything...ll right?

01:08:17.922 --> 01:08:18.922
And you cannot charge for raising your kundalini
because you have your kundalini intact there.

01:08:18.922 --> 01:08:19.922
You are just there.

01:08:19.922 --> 01:08:20.922
You have everything.

01:08:20.922 --> 01:08:21.922
Only thing, by my being here, your kundalini
rises by itself.

01:08:21.922 --> 01:08:22.922
So you cannot pay.

01:08:22.922 --> 01:08:23.922
Do you pay the Mother Earth for sprouting...eed?

01:08:23.922 --> 01:08:24.922
They do help temporarily.

01:08:24.922 --> 01:08:25.922
They do.

01:08:25.922 --> 01:08:26.922
For example, somebody gives you...antra.

01:08:26.922 --> 01:08:27.922
Alright, take...antra...’ll tell you...ay
they say Rama Sita.

01:08:27.922 --> 01:08:28.922
Now, there cannot be only one mantra belonging
to any one in any science of mantras.

01:08:28.922 --> 01:08:29.922
Because you people are so naive...ou see...hey
say “all right, you take the name of Rama."

01:08:29.922 --> 01:08:30.922
This cannot be done.

01:08:30.922 --> 01:08:31.922
Rama mantra is only on the right heart chakra.

01:08:31.922 --> 01:08:32.922
If you have...roblem, has to be given by...ealized
soul because it has to be...onnected one.

01:08:32.922 --> 01:08:33.922
It is...cience, you know.

01:08:33.922 --> 01:08:34.922
All of them know what mantra is to be said
at what point because they know how to raise

01:08:34.922 --> 01:08:35.922
the kundalini....

01:08:35.922 --> 01:08:36.922
they know where it is obstructed and what
mantra is to be said and which Deity is to

01:08:36.922 --> 01:08:37.922
be awakened.

01:08:37.922 --> 01:08:40.172
Notice the mantra for which particular mantra
(word?)...hey know all that and they know

01:08:40.172 --> 01:08:41.172
all the methods.

01:08:41.172 --> 01:08:42.172
But why they may give you...antra?

01:08:42.172 --> 01:08:43.172
Now, you may feel better...eally, sometimes
you may feel dynamic.

01:08:43.172 --> 01:08:44.172
You feel, “Oh,...m very activated; maybe...m
over active."

01:08:44.172 --> 01:08:45.172
And...pirit (if that name may be allowed)
may come around...nd you may become possessed...nd

01:08:45.172 --> 01:08:46.172
you might become extremely active.

01:08:46.172 --> 01:08:47.172
But, then you’ll go down.

01:08:47.172 --> 01:08:48.172
Within five years, there will be...omplete
decline.

01:08:48.172 --> 01:08:49.172
You’ll be...ecluse.

01:08:49.172 --> 01:08:50.172
You’ll be...rightened person.

01:08:50.172 --> 01:08:51.172
You’ll be...oward.

01:08:51.172 --> 01:08:52.172
You won’t be able to even...here are people
I’ve known who can not even face (what do

01:08:52.172 --> 01:08:53.172
you call that...arlic.

01:08:53.172 --> 01:08:54.172
Can you imagine...fraid of...egetable?

01:08:54.172 --> 01:08:55.172
It’s really...here are people, if you snow
then garlic, they are frightened....ean, are

01:08:55.172 --> 01:08:56.172
you going to become like that?

01:08:56.172 --> 01:08:57.172
Is that freedom?

01:08:57.172 --> 01:08:58.172
Question: (A man had treid raising his kundalini
and was asking about seeing something (?) in

01:08:58.172 --> 01:08:59.172
his head and other places).

01:08:59.172 --> 01:09:00.172
Mother: You see, if you try your own self,
you see trying with the kundalini...ctually

01:09:00.172 --> 01:09:01.172
the sympathetic goes into activity.

01:09:01.172 --> 01:09:02.172
You have no right on the parasympathetic.

01:09:02.172 --> 01:09:03.172
Parasympathetic is the one which balances
and that is the central path of Sushumna through

01:09:03.172 --> 01:09:04.172
which the kundalini has to rise.

01:09:04.172 --> 01:09:05.172
But if you try anything, what you do is...lways
you can use sympathetic.

01:09:05.172 --> 01:09:06.172
I’ll give you an example.

01:09:06.172 --> 01:09:07.172
Supposing you are running fast.

01:09:07.172 --> 01:09:08.172
Alright, then you can raise the rate of your
heart.

01:09:08.172 --> 01:09:09.172
But you cannot slow it down.

01:09:09.172 --> 01:09:10.172
It slows down

01:09:10.172 --> 01:09:11.172
by itself.

01:09:11.172 --> 01:09:12.172
That is parasympathetic activity.

01:09:12.172 --> 01:09:13.172
So you just get into sympathetic activity
and sympathetic activity, if you overdo it,

01:09:13.172 --> 01:09:14.172
then all these symptoms happen and it’s
not healthful.

01:09:14.172 --> 01:09:15.172
On the contrary, chakras go into...

01:09:15.172 --> 01:09:16.172
.(quite like this is the left and the right
sympathetic and these are the centers).

01:09:16.172 --> 01:09:17.172
They get pulled down like that and if they
are pulled like this, then you are harmed.

01:09:17.172 --> 01:09:18.172
So is not an experience of kundalini; is of
the sympathetic.

01:09:18.172 --> 01:09:19.172
Question: “....his wasn’t anything...as
looking for or asking for, (etc.)but how come

01:09:19.172 --> 01:09:20.172
it went down, instead of coming up?”

01:09:20.172 --> 01:09:21.172
Mother: No, it doesn’t go down.

01:09:21.172 --> 01:09:22.172
Kundalini never goes down.

01:09:22.172 --> 01:09:23.172
It goes upward...lways.

01:09:23.172 --> 01:09:24.172
The thing that comes down is the grace, you
see.

01:09:24.172 --> 01:09:25.172
The grace comes down, not the Kundalini.

01:09:25.172 --> 01:09:26.172
Kundalini always goes upwards.

01:09:26.172 --> 01:09:27.172
And the grace comes on your sympathetic which
cools you down completely.

01:09:27.172 --> 01:09:28.172
You become absolutely relaxed with the grace.

01:09:28.172 --> 01:09:29.172
But the kundalini itself always goes up.

01:09:29.172 --> 01:09:30.172
It never comes down.

01:09:30.172 --> 01:09:31.172
But, in people, it so happens that kundalini
goes through this central path.

01:09:31.172 --> 01:09:32.172
Now, if it is...ort of...ery much rugged or
if it is extremely smooth due to the mistakes

01:09:32.172 --> 01:09:33.172
of the seekers, then it falls down.

01:09:33.172 --> 01:09:34.172
It falls down...t falls down is...ifferent
point then going like that.

01:09:34.172 --> 01:09:35.172
It falls down.

01:09:35.172 --> 01:09:36.172
Then you have to raise it again and tie it
up.

01:09:36.172 --> 01:09:37.172
Again, raise it and tie it up.

01:09:37.172 --> 01:09:38.172
In many people, it has to be done but it can
work out.

01:09:38.172 --> 01:09:39.172
You will get the complete knowledge, don’t
you worry.

01:09:39.172 --> 01:09:40.172
Now, he has been in eighteen months, but he
is...aster of kundalini.

01:09:40.172 --> 01:09:41.172
He can raise your kundalini and you are just
like him.

01:09:41.172 --> 01:09:42.172
You would become the same.

01:09:42.172 --> 01:09:43.172
There’s no problem at all.

01:09:43.172 --> 01:09:44.172
It will work out.

01:09:44.172 --> 01:09:45.172
Question:...ow did you get your realization?”

01:09:45.172 --> 01:09:46.172
Mother:...as born like that.

01:09:46.172 --> 01:09:47.172
I’m like this for ages....

01:09:47.172 --> 01:09:48.172
ancient....m...ystery...

01:09:48.172 --> 01:09:49.172
should say at the beginning.

01:09:49.172 --> 01:09:50.172
We should keep it as...ystery.

01:09:50.172 --> 01:09:51.172
Then you’ll discover me, all right?

01:09:51.172 --> 01:09:52.172
Let’s have it that way.

01:09:52.172 --> 01:09:53.172
First you discover yourself and then discover
me.

01:09:53.172 --> 01:09:54.172
Will be better idea, isn’t it?

01:09:54.172 --> 01:09:55.172
Because...on’t want to say something which
will unnecessarily make some people upset.

01:09:55.172 --> 01:09:56.172
Best is...ou become something.

01:09:56.172 --> 01:09:57.172
Question:...s it true...ealized guru has cool
air; not hot?”

01:09:57.172 --> 01:09:58.172
Mother: No, hot is very dangerous.

01:09:58.172 --> 01:09:59.172
Interuption: “....ut...ool one, is also
dangerous?”

01:09:59.172 --> 01:10:00.172
Mother:...ut you don’t get air.

01:10:00.172 --> 01:10:01.172
You might feel extremely cool if you are...ow
blood pressure patient.

01:10:01.172 --> 01:10:02.172
If you are...eft sided persons...f you are
possessed, you feel absolutely cool, very

01:10:02.172 --> 01:10:03.172
cool.

01:10:03.172 --> 01:10:04.172
That’s not good.

01:10:04.172 --> 01:10:05.172
Feeling cool is different from...ool breeze;
like you feel...reeze coming.

01:10:05.172 --> 01:10:06.172
But should not be hot in any case.

01:10:06.172 --> 01:10:07.172
Hot is...ery dangerous thing.

01:10:07.172 --> 01:10:08.172
If it is too hot, that heat...t’s not good.

01:10:08.172 --> 01:10:09.172
Question: “Why do you get...low of hot air?”

01:10:09.172 --> 01:10:10.172
Mother: It’s...riction.

01:10:10.172 --> 01:10:11.172
It’s...riction of the Divine.

01:10:11.172 --> 01:10:12.172
You see, when the Kundalini’s rising, She
should normally give you cool breeze....

01:10:12.172 --> 01:10:13.172
cool breeze in the hands...hen She does.

01:10:13.172 --> 01:10:14.172
But if there’s...riction...lways friction
makes it hot.

01:10:14.172 --> 01:10:15.172
But it cools down.

01:10:15.172 --> 01:10:16.172
There’s no problem.

01:10:16.172 --> 01:10:17.172
In the beginning, most of you will get hot,
little bit.

01:10:17.172 --> 01:10:18.172
Because, after all, you see you know...ou
are all very complicated people.

01:10:18.172 --> 01:10:19.172
Our brains especially are modern brains, you
see.

01:10:19.172 --> 01:10:20.172
So we have been thinking, thinking, thinking.

01:10:20.172 --> 01:10:21.172
Just, we cannot stop our thinking for...inute
even.

01:10:21.172 --> 01:10:22.172
But the first thing that will happen is that
you enter into thoughtless awareness.

01:10:22.172 --> 01:10:23.172
That’s called as Nirvachara Samahdi, in
Sanskrit.

01:10:23.172 --> 01:10:24.172
Means you become....

01:10:24.172 --> 01:10:25.172
you are aware, absolutely aware.

01:10:25.172 --> 01:10:26.172
There are no thoughts.

01:10:26.172 --> 01:10:27.172
The thoughts(word?)...hat the awakening of
Christ...hat’s the thing that should happen

01:10:27.172 --> 01:10:28.172
to you.

01:10:28.172 --> 01:10:29.172
Once that happens, then it passes through
here and you can feel the cool breeze.

01:10:29.172 --> 01:10:30.172
Many people who smoke cannot feel breeze in
the hand at the beginning because of this

01:10:30.172 --> 01:10:31.172
chakra being...ittle bit in trouble.

01:10:31.172 --> 01:10:32.172
But, then you start feeling...arsha (??), you
feel quite all right in the hands?

01:10:32.172 --> 01:10:33.172
She used to smoke.

01:10:33.172 --> 01:10:34.172
She is...reat seeker,...ust say.

01:10:34.172 --> 01:10:35.172
All right, should we have it now?

01:10:35.172 --> 01:10:36.172
Question: “If we’re going to receive the
Kundalini awakening, is it...rocess over several

01:10:36.172 --> 01:10:37.172
days?”

01:10:37.172 --> 01:10:38.172
Mother: No, it is...plit of...econd actually;
it is...plit of...econd.

01:10:38.172 --> 01:10:39.172
But it takes time in some people, as...aid,
because if there are obstructions...ou see.

01:10:39.172 --> 01:10:40.172
Now if you have...eautiful runway and...eautiful
aircraft, then the landing and take off are

01:10:40.172 --> 01:10:41.172
very smooth.

01:10:41.172 --> 01:10:42.172
But sometimes it is...econd-hand stop.

01:10:42.172 --> 01:10:43.172
Interruption:...hen, you mean it may come
tomorrow?”

01:10:43.172 --> 01:10:44.172
Warren: No, it’s highly likely you’ll
get it tonight.

01:10:44.172 --> 01:10:45.172
Mother: Yes, of course, just now.

01:10:45.172 --> 01:10:46.172
Just now.

01:10:46.172 --> 01:10:47.172
But you have to learn how to maintain it,
is the point.

01:10:47.172 --> 01:10:48.172
Just now, you are going to have it.

01:10:48.172 --> 01:10:49.172
It’s spontaneous.

01:10:49.172 --> 01:10:50.172
It is just now.

01:10:50.172 --> 01:10:51.172
But only one thing is that you should know
how to maintain it.

01:10:51.172 --> 01:10:52.172
Now supposing you get it and then outside
you start thinking about it.

01:10:52.172 --> 01:10:53.172
Then it goes down.

01:10:53.172 --> 01:10:54.172
The vibrations will be lost.

01:10:54.172 --> 01:10:55.172
You have to be careful.

01:10:55.172 --> 01:10:56.172
It’s like...eed sprouting, you know....eed
sprouting.

01:10:56.172 --> 01:10:57.172
It’s...eedling in the beginning.

01:10:57.172 --> 01:10:58.172
So you have to be careful for about seven
days.

01:10:58.172 --> 01:10:59.172
If you are careful, it is settled down in
about seven days.

01:10:59.172 --> 01:11:00.172
You have to be careful.

01:11:00.172 --> 01:11:01.172
We will tell you about it.

01:11:01.172 --> 01:11:02.172
Interruption: “The reason I’m asking is
because we’ll become messengers...

01:11:02.172 --> 01:11:03.172
”

01:11:03.172 --> 01:11:04.172
Mother: Yes, of course, of course.

01:11:04.172 --> 01:11:05.172
Next time I’m not going to import people
from Australia and from England.

01:11:05.172 --> 01:11:06.172
You have got to have the Americans here to
do this job.

01:11:06.172 --> 01:11:07.172
We are not going to import them from all over
the place.

01:11:07.172 --> 01:11:08.172
Two are coming from Switzerland.

01:11:08.172 --> 01:11:09.172
So that’s not...ery good sign....hink, actually,
Americans should go abroad and do it.

01:11:09.172 --> 01:11:10.172
They’ll go to India and to Indian villages....

01:11:10.172 --> 01:11:11.172
and they’ll do it in the Indian villages.

01:11:11.172 --> 01:11:12.172
Very simple, alright?

01:11:12.172 --> 01:11:13.172
Question: (Unintelligible....

01:11:13.172 --> 01:11:14.172
something about...eadache).

01:11:14.172 --> 01:11:15.172
Mother:...ell you what’s the problem with
you.

01:11:15.172 --> 01:11:16.172
You have...iver problem.

01:11:16.172 --> 01:11:17.172
You have...iver problem and that is showing.

01:11:17.172 --> 01:11:18.172
You see this is the beauty of Sahaja Yoga.

01:11:18.172 --> 01:11:19.172
Once you get realization, you start seeing
your body; feeling it.

01:11:19.172 --> 01:11:20.172
Whatever your problem, you know.

01:11:20.172 --> 01:11:21.172
You have You have...iver problem and it has
to be corrected.

01:11:21.172 --> 01:11:22.172
Now,...now you have...iver problem sitting
down here.

01:11:22.172 --> 01:11:23.172
And it’s very simple.

01:11:23.172 --> 01:11:24.172
Now in Sahaja Yoga, you can correct your liver
in no time.

01:11:24.172 --> 01:11:25.172
Once you correct your liver, you’ll have
never...eadache.

01:11:25.172 --> 01:11:26.172
But, it suggests that you have that and you’d
better get rid of it.

01:11:26.172 --> 01:11:27.172
You see it’s good you have...eadache, now
you’ll get after your liver.

01:11:27.172 --> 01:11:28.172
Otherwise, it becomes horribly bad, if you
continue....ean,...erson becomes mad and still

01:11:28.172 --> 01:11:29.172
he doesn’t know that he’s gone mad.

01:11:29.172 --> 01:11:30.172
It’s like that.

01:11:30.172 --> 01:11:31.172
The disease crawls into you.

01:11:31.172 --> 01:11:32.172
But in Sahaja Yoga, immediately you know.

01:11:32.172 --> 01:11:33.172
And you are...iver patient, you know that.

01:11:33.172 --> 01:11:34.172
It has to be corrected and it’s not difficult.

01:11:34.172 --> 01:11:35.172
Most of the diseases can be cured, except
for...ew like...hould say, cataracts or something

01:11:35.172 --> 01:11:36.172
like that where something is dead or maybe
where they put an artificial limb and all

01:11:36.172 --> 01:11:37.172
that.

01:11:37.172 --> 01:11:38.172
We can’t work out all of these things.

01:11:38.172 --> 01:11:39.172
But most of the things get cured, automatically....ean,
here they say if you cure someone, you’ll

01:11:39.172 --> 01:11:40.172
get put in the prison....ean,...on’t cure.

01:11:40.172 --> 01:11:41.172
You just get cured, you see.

01:11:41.172 --> 01:11:42.172
So...ope legally I’m all right.

01:11:42.172 --> 01:11:43.172
Christ would have been in jail here....on’t
know about the laws.

01:11:43.172 --> 01:11:44.172
But this time, I’m sure they cannot crucify
me.

01:11:44.172 --> 01:11:45.172
It’s alright.

01:11:45.172 --> 01:11:45.176
Let’s work it out.
