00:00:00.277 --> 00:00:04.879
...like a birthday of Shiva, you can say
or something, “How can it be?”,

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.225
because He is eternal, He is all the time
there.

00:00:09.426 --> 00:00:14.455
So what demarcates today’s
celebration,

00:00:14.656 --> 00:00:19.936
is the establishment of Shiva on this
earth.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:32.162
In the material self. Every matter has
been created with a deity

00:00:32.363 --> 00:00:37.862
and that deity is established in that
matter, as you know.

00:00:40.164 --> 00:00:47.801
So when it was thought by Adi Shakti

00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:52.462
that first we must establish Shiva; without
Shiva you cannot establish anything.

00:00:52.663 --> 00:00:56.243
First He is to be established, because
He is the absolute.

00:00:56.444 --> 00:01:00.657
So you have to establish Shiva.

00:01:00.858 --> 00:01:05.833
And now what should we do?
How to establish Him?

00:01:06.141 --> 00:01:11.351
He is the God of Tamo Guna.

00:01:11.552 --> 00:01:20.002
He is the cold, He is the God of all
that is not active.

00:01:20.207 --> 00:01:31.878
So first of all, this earth, when it
receded from the sun, which was very hot,

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:39.442
was taken very near to the moon. The moon
is the brother-in-law of Shiva.

00:01:40.461 --> 00:01:48.864
So it was taken so close to moon that
the whole earth got covered with ice.

00:01:51.063 --> 00:01:55.583
And it was then gradually moved towards
the sun.

00:01:55.784 --> 00:02:04.554
When it was moved towards the sun,
gradually, then it started melting.

00:02:04.755 --> 00:02:08.832
And the point that did not melt at all

00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:12.782
was the point where Shiva was to be
established.

00:02:12.983 --> 00:02:21.167
That was predestined, that spot, and
that spot is the Kailash.

00:02:21.368 --> 00:02:26.457
The ice never melts there and if you see

00:02:26.658 --> 00:02:30.241
the whole mountain is like the face
of Shiva –

00:02:30.442 --> 00:02:35.000
the eyes, the nose and everything you can
see clearly getting out –

00:02:35.201 --> 00:02:41.749
and all the year round, it keeps its shape
as it is.

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:46.792
That is how Shiva was created.

00:02:46.993 --> 00:02:56.869
And He was placed in a witness state,

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:05.609
as the spectator of all that happens
on this earth,

00:03:06.568 --> 00:03:08.936
facing towards the Kundalini of
the universe,

00:03:09.137 --> 00:03:13.739
which they were going to place in India.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.359
So He is facing towards the south.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:25.256
He is looking at the south with both
the hands like this,

00:03:25.962 --> 00:03:32.955
like a spectator watching the spectacle
of the Adi Kundalini.

00:03:34.695 --> 00:03:38.457
That is how Shiva was created.

00:03:38.658 --> 00:03:49.513
So, though we say that the heart
of the universe is England,

00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:59.386
still Shiva resides on top of
the Sahasrara: this is the seat.

00:04:01.923 --> 00:04:06.467
Like you have got the seat of Shiva on top
of your head,

00:04:06.668 --> 00:04:14.818
but He resides in your heart, in the same
way Shiva belongs to this place

00:04:15.056 --> 00:04:20.154
and He looks at the whole body from that,
this point -

00:04:20.355 --> 00:04:28.197
so the Feet are the south, this
(Sahasrara) is the north,

00:04:28.527 --> 00:04:36.166
this is the east, I'm sorry, west (right
arm), and this is the east (left arm).

00:04:36.367 --> 00:04:43.476
That is how we can see the whole map of
the universe, of the world that is created.

00:04:43.677 --> 00:04:49.964
So now… [(Hindi) You can just sit.
Yogi: Sit down.

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:52.108
Shri Mataji: Sit down, sit down. Don’t
stand up.

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:56.199
Listen to My lecture. Now don’t take
photographs.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.407
You must listen to My lecture attentively.

00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:11.954
In a meditative way you must listen to Me.
You must make full use of Me, isn’t it?

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.756
You should be meditative. Then you can hear
Me very clearly, you don’t have to bother.

00:05:18.957 --> 00:05:25.071
You have to be meditative.]
Yogi: So, this is south.

00:05:25.272 --> 00:05:34.185
Shri Mataji: So you are facing towards
the south as a witness.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:41.298
Just now, somebody told Me that
in the south people put their head

00:05:41.498 --> 00:05:47.128
towards the south and put their feet
towards the north, I mean, imagine.

00:05:47.329 --> 00:05:50.919
The feet are put towards Shiva, who is
in the north.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.684
Kailasha is in the north, isn’t it? It is
not in the south.

00:05:55.885 --> 00:06:01.161
So why put your feet towards the north?
I mean, one must use logic.

00:06:02.788 --> 00:06:06.196
These brahmins have told you all these
stories and you are doing just the opposite

00:06:06.397 --> 00:06:08.911
that should not be done.

00:06:09.112 --> 00:06:12.329
Sometimes I feel, “God save this country
from brahmins.”

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.782
They’re everywhere now: they’re our rulers,
they’re everywhere,

00:06:16.943 --> 00:06:19.774
and they have no idea what Brahma is.

00:06:19.975 --> 00:06:23.854
If they are real Brahmins, I’m sure
one day,

00:06:24.055 --> 00:06:29.895
the real Brahmins will be in charge
of this country.

00:06:31.877 --> 00:06:38.410
So now, when we understand

00:06:38.611 --> 00:06:42.632
that Shiva is the first thing that is
established in the matter,

00:06:42.833 --> 00:06:47.680
then in us also first the Shiva is
established.

00:06:49.465 --> 00:06:53.399
When the foetus takes its form,

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.618
the throb in the heart is the establishment
of Shiva.

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:03.922
That is the sign that Shiva has been
established.

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:13.581
In case of people

00:07:15.128 --> 00:07:20.621
who are born with bad heart or with
troubles,

00:07:21.358 --> 00:07:25.039
one has to say that Shiva is not fully
established.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:30.808
Not that they are bad people, but they are
not supposed to live for long,

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:33.669
and have to have another heart later on
maybe,

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:38.560
or that there might be some sort of
a problem in their previous lives,

00:07:38.761 --> 00:07:45.255
and if they pay attention to Shiva tattwa,
their heart can be cured.

00:07:47.202 --> 00:07:51.297
So the most important organ in the body
is the heart.

00:07:51.507 --> 00:07:55.460
If the heart fails, you cannot remain
on this earth.

00:07:55.661 --> 00:07:58.488
So the most important thing is to look
after

00:07:58.689 --> 00:08:05.065
your Shiva principle which is the Atma.

00:08:05.266 --> 00:08:10.114
We are worried about every sort of mundane
thing.

00:08:10.637 --> 00:08:14.588
Worried about this, worried about that,

00:08:14.789 --> 00:08:21.370
but we are not worried about our Spirit.

00:08:22.455 --> 00:08:25.071
This is the biggest problem with us.

00:08:25.288 --> 00:08:30.515
If you worry about your Spirit, if you pay
attention to your Spirit,

00:08:30.716 --> 00:08:37.617
the whole universe then vibrates with
Parabrahma, which is nothing but joy.

00:08:37.818 --> 00:08:46.519
So without, without any attention
to Spirit,

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.646
if we think we can enjoy life, you cannot.

00:08:49.847 --> 00:08:53.828
You cannot enjoy your life if you pay
attention

00:08:54.029 --> 00:09:01.507
to other nonsensical things and you do not
pay attention to your Spirit.

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:07.658
The complete silence comes into us only
through Spirit.

00:09:07.859 --> 00:09:13.238
If the Spirit is awakened within us, this
silence starts working

00:09:13.439 --> 00:09:20.296
and you feel extremely relaxed and
absolutely one with your Self.

00:09:20.497 --> 00:09:27.126
There is no problem, you don’t seek other
things that normally people seek -

00:09:27.327 --> 00:09:33.843
you seek your own company and you want
to be some time with yourself.

00:09:34.044 --> 00:09:38.522
Only thing that you seek after finding
your Spirit

00:09:38.723 --> 00:09:44.727
is the company of other Sahaja Yogis who
also have found the Spirit,

00:09:44.928 --> 00:09:50.455
so there is a rapport established between
Spirits, that is in the heart.

00:09:50.656 --> 00:09:55.711
And this Spirit is the universal being
within us, about which I have told you

00:09:55.912 --> 00:09:58.330
that once you become one with the Spirit,

00:09:58.531 --> 00:10:02.310
you automatically become universally
conscious.

00:10:02.511 --> 00:10:06.835
There are so many qualities of the Shiva,
Shiva tattwa,

00:10:07.036 --> 00:10:12.318
of the principle of Shiva, that I need not
tell you, but today I will tell you

00:10:12.519 --> 00:10:17.450
another dimension, which I have not touched
so far, about Shiva tattwa.

00:10:19.513 --> 00:10:22.975
The physical aspect of Shiva tattwa is

00:10:23.176 --> 00:10:30.503
that such a person is a more a cold type
of a person.

00:10:30.704 --> 00:10:41.279
In the sense, that such a person is not
a person who gives hot vibrations,

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:49.193
but who has too much of it (cold)
sometimes, not in balance, overdoes it,

00:10:49.394 --> 00:10:56.978
develops a kind of a temperament which
can be extremely cold.

00:10:57.179 --> 00:11:02.128
Could be low blood pressure with it,
could be diarrhea also,

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:07.769
diarrhea also one can get with too much
of spiritual strength.

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:14.069
And also could be on the love side because
of the left side.

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:21.779
Because left side is the kapha as you call
it, is kapha is the phlegm that is more.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:27.127
Because the left side is more, such
a person is always apt to catch colds

00:11:27.328 --> 00:11:33.288
and has problems of the colds.

00:11:33.489 --> 00:11:36.116
So such a person has to protect oneself

00:11:36.317 --> 00:11:39.404
from getting into colds and things
like that,

00:11:39.605 --> 00:11:44.297
and the methods to be employed are to be
learnt through Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:44.498 --> 00:11:53.728
But to give it a balance, the Spirit itself
is beyond health problems.

00:11:53.929 --> 00:12:00.241
But the left-sided person who always thinks
of the Spirit, also can become one-sided.

00:12:00.442 --> 00:12:04.371
When he has to live on this earth, he has
to be a balanced person.

00:12:04.572 --> 00:12:09.331
So he has to take to another side and
that side is the activity

00:12:09.532 --> 00:12:16.255
of the spiritual growth within himself.
A person who is very spiritually developed

00:12:16.456 --> 00:12:20.550
cannot exist as a Shiva tattwa on this
earth.

00:12:20.751 --> 00:12:24.441
He has to exist as a balanced personality.

00:12:24.642 --> 00:12:28.611
And when he starts developing that
balancing within himself,

00:12:28.812 --> 00:12:35.383
the Spirit from his heart starts rising
and goes on top of his head.

00:12:35.584 --> 00:12:39.478
So this is the second stage where
one has to go.

00:12:39.679 --> 00:12:41.908
Here is the whole collectivity.

00:12:42.109 --> 00:12:50.630
So when you start taking your love
and affection

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:58.954
into your central nervous system, you can
say, and put it on top of your head,

00:12:59.155 --> 00:13:02.144
that means, as soon as you put it
in your Virat,

00:13:02.345 --> 00:13:06.283
when it starts spreading through
your Virata shakti,

00:13:06.484 --> 00:13:12.102
through your collective being, then only
you are a complete personality.

00:13:12.303 --> 00:13:15.879
Otherwise, you are Shiva tattwa –
Shiva tattwa exists

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.240
whether this universe exists or not.

00:13:21.526 --> 00:13:25.579
It exists even when the whole universe
is existing;

00:13:25.853 --> 00:13:33.219
even, even it vanishes, it all goes into
that magnet, into that Shiva tattwa.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:38.602
So a person who has a spiritual hankering
must know

00:13:38.803 --> 00:13:45.040
that to raise your Shiva above the heart
level,

00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:53.550
he has to raise it gradually onto a very
detached method

00:13:53.751 --> 00:13:58.761
of existing on top of the Sahasrara,

00:13:59.119 --> 00:14:04.076
where there is a complete balance,
complete balance.

00:14:04.277 --> 00:14:10.655
Many people I have seen in Sahaja Yoga are
extremely loving, nice, very sweet persons.

00:14:10.856 --> 00:14:14.788
Like in Delhi, I would say, people are not
so harsh as in Bombay.

00:14:14.989 --> 00:14:19.470
Bombay people could be harsh, Puna people
are little harsher also.

00:14:19.671 --> 00:14:24.440
But Bombay and Puna people are deeper.

00:14:24.641 --> 00:14:31.006
The reason is they have balanced themselves
a little,

00:14:31.207 --> 00:14:35.673
and they have gone above their heart
feelings, like sympathies, you see.

00:14:35.874 --> 00:14:40.341
“Don’t be unkind to somebody, don’t say
anything harsh to somebody,”

00:14:40.542 --> 00:14:43.008
can be very, very funny also sometimes.

00:14:43.209 --> 00:14:50.738
Like yesterday, I was sleeping in the place
where you always sleep.

00:14:50.939 --> 00:14:55.182
Now if I was in any Bombay or Puna center,
anywhere,

00:14:55.383 --> 00:14:58.594
you can’t hear any voice, anywhere,
nothing.

00:14:58.795 --> 00:15:06.179
Like a lion, you see, like a tiger is in
a forest, nobody will hear your voice.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.109
If there’s a tiger,

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:13.135
you can know for miles together there’s
tiger somewhere, it’s so silent.

00:15:13.336 --> 00:15:17.144
But if I’m in Delhi, then everybody’s
talking:

00:15:17.345 --> 00:15:21.259
somebody was talking about money, this,
that, the whole kind of jabbering was [on],

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:25.099
even the Sahaja Yogis from foreign had
become Delhi Sahaja Yogis.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.954
They were all talking so much, I was
surprised.

00:15:28.155 --> 00:15:30.821
How did they take to this talking so much
there?

00:15:31.022 --> 00:15:34.811
All were talking, jabber, jabber.
On the contrary, if I’m sleeping there,

00:15:35.012 --> 00:15:39.081
you all should have been in meditation,
sitting down and doing meditation.

00:15:39.282 --> 00:15:43.714
Instead of that, everyone was busy with
all the possible nonsensical talks,

00:15:43.915 --> 00:15:47.901
as if they have no other chance to talk.

00:15:48.695 --> 00:15:51.793
And they were all jabbering, jab, jab,
jab, jab; I didn’t know what to say

00:15:51.994 --> 00:15:55.678
and I just, I didn’t know what to do.
That's what.

00:15:55.879 --> 00:16:02.154
But this is what one has to know, that
unless and until you raise

00:16:02.355 --> 00:16:06.246
your sympathetic attitudes – like you tell
somebody something,

00:16:06.447 --> 00:16:11.732
“I have had such a problem in this
business”, say example like this.

00:16:11.933 --> 00:16:13.987
I mean, what a topic, but doesn’t matter.

00:16:14.188 --> 00:16:17.073
If you start, “I had a problem with this”,
another will:

00:16:17.274 --> 00:16:20.839
“Yes, I too had…”, you see, the sympathies.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.569
“I too had such a problem, these people
are so bad,

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:26.964
that happened, he had the same problem”,
same talk.

00:16:27.165 --> 00:16:33.177
They are all, you see, talking about things
which are irrelevant to Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:33.378 --> 00:16:37.588
Even relevant to Sahaja Yoga you should
not talk when I’m there.

00:16:37.789 --> 00:16:40.824
I have to make a humble request to all
of you –

00:16:41.025 --> 00:16:44.150
that the way you people sometimes behave
is not good

00:16:44.351 --> 00:16:49.290
and is not congenial to Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:49.491 --> 00:16:53.826
Even to keep your mouth open in My front
is not a good thing.

00:16:54.027 --> 00:16:56.912
But I don’t want to tell you in such
details,

00:16:57.113 --> 00:17:01.789
but it is so many things are there that
you have to learn

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:05.323
before you raise your Shiva tattwa
from your heart.

00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:10.140
You are good at pleasing people,
at organizing you are excellent,

00:17:10.341 --> 00:17:13.236
you organize very well, there are
no quarrels.

00:17:13.437 --> 00:17:19.340
Sahaja Yogis in Bombay quarrel quite a lot
and even Puna Sahaja Yogis are quarrelsome.

00:17:19.541 --> 00:17:22.828
But I must say, Puna Sahaja Yogis are
very deep,

00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:27.370
and Bombay Sahaja Yogis are very deep
individually, they have achieved something.

00:17:27.571 --> 00:17:32.098
Now they have to go further than that,
is to go little bit in the heart again.

00:17:32.299 --> 00:17:36.397
This is the second descent they have
to have to feel more that way,

00:17:36.598 --> 00:17:41.311
they are very, very strict with people.

00:17:41.512 --> 00:17:45.489
But you see, certain amount of strictness
is to be accepted.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:51.995
For example, if somebody is told, “Don’t
touch Mother’s feet”, one feels very bad.

00:17:52.196 --> 00:17:56.144
But this is a very mundane sort of
an understanding of the Mother.

00:17:56.345 --> 00:18:00.191
If She says, “Don’t touch My feet”, that’s
what you are supposed to do.

00:18:00.392 --> 00:18:06.576
You have to do exactly what will please Me,
and not what will please you.

00:18:06.777 --> 00:18:10.560
So you must change your attention from
pleasing all the public.

00:18:10.761 --> 00:18:14.849
Some people say, “Those who come first
time, Mother, we must not say this”.

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:19.029
You must! Certain things you must say
to them.

00:18:19.237 --> 00:18:28.628
Otherwise, you will make Me a-prasanna;
that will cause problems!

00:18:28.829 --> 00:18:32.622
But when you say to others, you need not go
like Puna and Bombay people

00:18:32.823 --> 00:18:38.351
in their special Marathi language, but
say it in a proper Urdu style,

00:18:38.552 --> 00:18:42.541
that people don’t feel bad, but you must
say it!

00:18:42.742 --> 00:18:45.435
You should not put those people on My head;

00:18:45.636 --> 00:18:49.740
instead of that, you should tell them
in such a way that people are all right.

00:18:49.941 --> 00:18:52.934
So to go deeper into you,
you must do also

00:18:53.135 --> 00:18:57.423
individual meditation and samuhik
(collective).

00:18:57.624 --> 00:19:00.787
I would not say all the Sahaja Yogis
in Delhi are like that,

00:19:00.988 --> 00:19:05.091
but… we are very good at organizing,

00:19:05.292 --> 00:19:10.484
which our Bombay Sahaja Yogis and these
Puna Sahaja Yogis must learn.

00:19:10.685 --> 00:19:13.939
They quarrel among themselves and I really
get fed up.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:18.040
And they treat each other shabbily, that
I don’t like.

00:19:18.241 --> 00:19:22.211
But individually they are all right,
so they become individualistic.

00:19:22.412 --> 00:19:30.446
Some people become individualistic and some
people become publicist, publicist,

00:19:30.647 --> 00:19:33.560
you see, they’ll please the public, now
they are two extremes.

00:19:33.761 --> 00:19:40.368
What should a Sahaja Yogi do? They have
to become Mother addicts.

00:19:40.569 --> 00:19:44.823
They should do what your Mother likes.

00:19:45.892 --> 00:19:51.682
Do you understand? Need not please the
public or need not please the individual,

00:19:51.883 --> 00:19:55.546
but do what your Mother will like.
That’s a very simple thing

00:19:55.747 --> 00:20:01.139
which Adi Shankaracharya has told you,
that just keep the Mother pleased.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:03.747
But nobody makes that study.

00:20:03.948 --> 00:20:07.646
Try to make the study, “What makes
Mother pleased?”

00:20:07.853 --> 00:20:16.915
Then you will see, I’m very easily pleased,
you see, as a Shiva tattwa.

00:20:17.611 --> 00:20:22.739
Even if you make mistakes, thrice you pull
your ears, it's all right.

00:20:24.968 --> 00:20:28.630
But don't go too far with it.

00:20:28.962 --> 00:20:32.400
You see, the mistakes you commit is
all right,

00:20:32.601 --> 00:20:36.679
but don’t take it for granted that you can
go on committing mistakes.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:41.516
Because you really get a big rope, but you
will hang yourself ultimately, isn’t it?

00:20:41.717 --> 00:20:44.601
So be afraid of the rope also which is
given to you,

00:20:44.802 --> 00:20:47.610
it will hang you much better, otherwise.

00:20:47.811 --> 00:20:52.472
So one has to understand that you should
not be addicted to public opinion

00:20:52.673 --> 00:20:57.151
or to the opinion of your own. Both things
are wrong.

00:20:57.352 --> 00:21:02.333
You must behave in such a manner that it
should please all the deities within Me.

00:21:02.534 --> 00:21:07.546
As far as I am concerned, I don't exist,
I have no existence.

00:21:07.747 --> 00:21:12.907
Really, believe Me, I have no existence
at all, I just...

00:21:14.285 --> 00:21:18.578
It's an assemblage of so many existences,
you can say.

00:21:18.779 --> 00:21:22.722
Otherwise, I don’t exist, I don’t find
Myself anywhere in this body, anywhere;

00:21:22.923 --> 00:21:25.183
I don’t find Myself anywhere
in the universe.

00:21:25.384 --> 00:21:32.187
I’m nowhere, I sometimes find, “What is all
this? Is not Mine, is all foreign to Me.”

00:21:32.388 --> 00:21:41.464
But still, I permeate into it, enjoy it,
live with it,

00:21:41.665 --> 00:21:45.907
but I’m not in it, nowhere.

00:21:46.108 --> 00:21:51.090
So if you just try to understand what
pleases your Mother,

00:21:51.307 --> 00:21:55.305
you will develop your dignity because I
want you to be dignified;

00:21:55.506 --> 00:21:59.230
it will develop your joy because I want you
to be joyous;

00:21:59.431 --> 00:22:09.914
it will give you more capacity to achieve
more vibrations within yourself

00:22:10.115 --> 00:22:13.411
because that is what I’m giving.

00:22:13.612 --> 00:22:19.054
Whatever is good for you, if you do that,
it will please Me.

00:22:19.255 --> 00:22:22.540
But what I think is good for you, you may
not think;

00:22:22.741 --> 00:22:27.184
you may have your own ideas,
individualistic again

00:22:27.385 --> 00:22:30.012
or maybe public-wise.

00:22:30.213 --> 00:22:33.838
Like I’ve told you that, “Please, don’t
arrange My program

00:22:34.039 --> 00:22:39.055
before 7 o’clock in the evening.” Then you
may say, “It won’t suit our public.”

00:22:39.256 --> 00:22:43.789
Doesn’t matter: it doesn’t suit Me, that’s
the main point.

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:48.563
Because I have certain timings when only
I can really be very good.

00:22:48.764 --> 00:22:52.980
That time I have to give to somebody else,
is fixed!

00:22:53.181 --> 00:22:56.786
So you don’t fix My timings according
to yours.

00:22:56.987 --> 00:23:00.639
Morning time before 11 o’clock no programs
should be fixed.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.945
Early in the morning if you fix,
fix at five, I don’t mind.

00:23:05.146 --> 00:23:09.776
I have certain timings which I have to use
for some other purpose.

00:23:09.977 --> 00:23:15.009
So you have to understand that whatever
suits Me should be done,

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:21.628
because that is for your good also, because
there are most beneficial.

00:23:21.829 --> 00:23:27.583
I’m just telling you My own tricks so that
you take more advantage of Me.

00:23:27.996 --> 00:23:32.492
But they insist on that the people who are
going to the office won’t be able to come -

00:23:32.693 --> 00:23:36.334
such people should not come at all!

00:23:36.535 --> 00:23:42.415
If there is a picture at 7 o’clock,
they’ll go at that picture or not?

00:23:43.003 --> 00:23:46.918
Then why should you make your Mother
so cheap

00:23:47.119 --> 00:23:50.669
that it should suit their convenience?

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:55.074
Iif there are few people, it is even better
for us:

00:23:55.275 --> 00:23:58.831
we’ll have better accommodation
in the Kingdom of God.

00:23:59.032 --> 00:24:04.784
So don't make Me cheap! That one should
understand, not to cheapen Me,

00:24:04.985 --> 00:24:09.468
keeping the dignity of your Mother.
Whatever is to be achieved, I agree,

00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:14.163
that all the brothers and sisters must be
helped, all the public must be helped,

00:24:14.363 --> 00:24:18.354
but we can’t get rid of the kachras
(rubbish), otherwise, you see.

00:24:18.556 --> 00:24:21.772
There are lots of things which are to be
just thrown away.

00:24:21.973 --> 00:24:25.538
So we don’t, should not worry about
the kachra part.

00:24:25.739 --> 00:24:28.084
Whatever is the best we’ll have,

00:24:28.285 --> 00:24:32.020
but to have that also one should not speak
harshly.

00:24:32.221 --> 00:24:34.992
Again I will say not to use harsh words.

00:24:35.193 --> 00:24:38.990
The way people, “Get out, get out, get
out!”, like that one should not talk.

00:24:39.191 --> 00:24:42.293
Change your language. You must educate
yourself

00:24:42.494 --> 00:24:47.262
how to talk to people in a soft way,
in a proper way.

00:24:47.463 --> 00:24:51.860
That is very important for Sahaja Yoga,
because if you go on insulting,

00:24:52.061 --> 00:24:56.737
maybe you might insult some saint!
So you should not do in that way.

00:24:56.938 --> 00:25:05.809
Understand it, and try to make your
individual being so capable that,

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:11.901
when you go to the public, you are able
to put the right perspective,

00:25:12.102 --> 00:25:23.494
the right concept, the right conduct, the
right behavior, and the right knowledge.

00:25:23.695 --> 00:25:29.540
Here I do not mean right rationally,
right which is absolute.

00:25:29.741 --> 00:25:35.481
The Shiva is the absolute, He is the giver
of absolute knowledge,

00:25:35.682 --> 00:25:38.423
He knows what pleases Me.

00:25:38.624 --> 00:25:47.992
The moment something will happen that will
really displease Me, He will shut the show.

00:25:48.222 --> 00:25:52.233
He is just watching this to please Me.

00:25:52.434 --> 00:25:57.308
The moment he’ll find that this is not
working out, He’ll stop the whole show

00:25:57.509 --> 00:26:01.381
and He'll say, “Shut it, finished”.

00:26:02.475 --> 00:26:07.032
So though I may say the spectator is Shiva,
but He is just the judge,

00:26:07.233 --> 00:26:10.768
and He sees those things, so try to be
all right.

00:26:10.969 --> 00:26:16.942
A nice spectacle I try to make to please
Shiva so He continues to be there,

00:26:17.143 --> 00:26:20.775
and this let [let this?] universe be a nice
place for staying,

00:26:20.976 --> 00:26:29.092
in which you rise and attain that eternal
life which is promised to you.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:34.565
But one has to understand what pleases
Mother.

00:26:34.766 --> 00:26:40.437
Some people have a habit of just looking
at Me straight all the time:

00:26:40.637 --> 00:26:42.938
it’s not the way to be done!

00:26:43.139 --> 00:26:50.176
Put your eyes down, all the time just you
cannot stare at Me, it’s stupid!

00:26:50.377 --> 00:26:53.279
Apart from stupidity, it will not please
Me.

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:58.892
Will it please you if I start staring
at you all the time?

00:26:59.093 --> 00:27:02.453
I don’t stare at you, I try to please you
by doing all kinds of things:

00:27:02.654 --> 00:27:05.788
why don’t you learn something from Me,
how I try to please you?

00:27:05.989 --> 00:27:11.653
You can’t do all these things of course,
I know, because somebody says, “Mother,

00:27:11.859 --> 00:27:15.078
we went there, a horse was given to us,
this, that.”

00:27:15.279 --> 00:27:18.793
This side you cannot achieve yourself
for Me, isn't it?

00:27:18.994 --> 00:27:23.559
If I have a difficulty, you can’t solve
My difficulty, isn’t it?

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.671
But I can solve your difficulties; so I can
please you very easily

00:27:26.872 --> 00:27:29.129
because I have so many methods of pleasing
you.

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:33.716
For whatever methods are there, by which
one should not positively displease,

00:27:33.917 --> 00:27:36.934
that’s the only thing is. You don’t do
anything special,

00:27:37.135 --> 00:27:40.696
but don’t do something extraordinary
just to displease.

00:27:40.897 --> 00:27:44.814
If you understand this simple thing,
that don’t try to do anything

00:27:45.015 --> 00:27:49.877
that will displease, you please Me,
It is so simple.

00:27:50.086 --> 00:27:56.501
You don’t have to do anything extra,
just try to be

00:27:56.702 --> 00:28:03.830
loving, affectionate, dignified, and I’ll
be very happy with all that.

00:28:04.031 --> 00:28:07.301
As it is I’m overjoyed, I’m very happy
with you.

00:28:07.502 --> 00:28:09.849
But I have to tell you what one has
to achieve,

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:13.079
and how one has to go above these things.

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:23.644
So it is necessary now for Delhi people
to rise from the heart to the Sahasrara.

00:28:23.845 --> 00:28:30.705
And it is necessary for Bombay and Puna
people to go from heart to the…

00:28:30.906 --> 00:28:36.856
go from the Sahasrara to the heart.

00:28:37.064 --> 00:28:44.707
I would say, Rahuri people are in between.
Rahuri people are in between.

00:28:44.908 --> 00:28:49.968
They are very good organizers, and they
don’t create problems for Me,

00:28:50.169 --> 00:28:52.603
as far as individuals are concerned.

00:28:52.804 --> 00:28:58.443
So I think, Rahuri is a place, perhaps
maybe it is My Mecca,

00:28:58.644 --> 00:29:03.258
that it is so good, whatever it is.
But we all can be like that.

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:10.584
We all can change and inform each other
and improve and educate ourselves.

00:29:10.785 --> 00:29:14.656
All this education can come to us, if we
really love ourselves,

00:29:14.857 --> 00:29:16.964
and care for our evolution.

00:29:17.165 --> 00:29:21.279
We don’t have to bother about it much,
if we really care for it.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:27.768
Gradually, all these things will work out
and the balance can be established.

00:29:27.969 --> 00:29:33.101
Those people who talk too much, should not
talk so much.

00:29:33.302 --> 00:29:37.160
What I feel that when you talk too much,
when you stop, you just stop.

00:29:37.361 --> 00:29:40.954
It is in between: when it is necessary
you must talk,

00:29:41.155 --> 00:29:44.836
when it is not necessary you should
not talk.

00:29:45.037 --> 00:29:50.281
So that kind of personality gradually
you can develop with Sahaja Yoga,

00:29:50.482 --> 00:29:57.722
that you will develop that wisdom how far
to go, how far not to go.

00:29:57.923 --> 00:30:00.987
Not to go is the quality of Shiva.

00:30:01.188 --> 00:30:07.089
He doesn’t do anything, He is just sitting
down there and watching the whole joke.

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:14.270
He doesn’t do anything, but still, He’s
the one who has to watch:

00:30:14.471 --> 00:30:19.912
if He doesn’t watch, then the whole show
is over.

00:30:21.007 --> 00:30:27.720
If you understand that in not doing
anything, how much He’s doing!

00:30:27.921 --> 00:30:31.130
See the contrast: He’s doing nothing
as such.

00:30:31.331 --> 00:30:35.359
But He’s making everybody dance,
to please Him.

00:30:36.232 --> 00:30:40.167
In the same way, in one shot you have
both the natures:

00:30:40.368 --> 00:30:46.197
as Sahaja Yogis you can achieve that kind
of a balanced personality.

00:30:46.426 --> 00:30:53.217
It is for your good, for your evolution,
for your development.

00:30:53.427 --> 00:30:57.532
So today, all of you have a great chance
of evolving

00:30:57.733 --> 00:31:01.181
individually within yourself the Shiva
tattwa,

00:31:01.382 --> 00:31:08.259
which ultimately permeates into the whole.

00:31:09.148 --> 00:31:14.138
Kabira has said it in a beautiful couplet,
I don’t know if you people have understood,

00:31:14.339 --> 00:31:18.785
which is: (Hindi) “Man mamta ko
Thir kar launga”.

00:31:18.986 --> 00:31:25.429
"The compassion of my heart I will vibrate,
I will bring it out;

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:32.145
the compassion of my heart I will vibrate,
I’ll bring it out;

00:31:32.346 --> 00:31:37.867
“Aur paancho tattwa milaunga”,
and put it into the five elements."

00:31:38.083 --> 00:31:40.571
See Kabira, do you follow him how great
he is?

00:31:40.781 --> 00:31:42.760
People talk of Kabir Das, see, he says
that,

00:31:42.961 --> 00:31:48.224
“Take it out of the heart and put it into
all the five elements.”

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:51.245
This is what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:51.446 --> 00:31:56.290
If you understand that, then you don’t have
to understand anything else.

00:31:56.491 --> 00:32:00.290
You have got it in your heart, become
the capitalist in your heart,

00:32:00.491 --> 00:32:03.324
and become a communist outside.

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:08.568
If you can achieve this balance properly,
you have done it.

00:32:08.769 --> 00:32:14.967
And we can do it, we all of us put together
we will do it, we can achieve it;

00:32:15.168 --> 00:32:18.719
and we can show to the world that
everyone can achieve it.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:25.000
All ordinary human beings so-called will,
can become extraordinary.

00:32:25.201 --> 00:32:29.703
So today, we have to decide about ourselves
that we are going to do it,

00:32:29.904 --> 00:32:35.737
we are going to be educated about it,
in a spiritual way, in a Sahaja way.

00:32:35.938 --> 00:32:39.131
And every moment if you watch yourself,
you can do it.

00:32:39.332 --> 00:32:42.814
And not to explain yourself, or to say,
“Oh, this happened to me,

00:32:43.015 --> 00:32:44.952
that happened to me”; that’s not the point.

00:32:45.153 --> 00:32:48.041
Many people tell Me like that, that’s
absurd.

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:50.294
You challenge yourself: How can it
happen to you?

00:32:50.495 --> 00:32:53.311
Why don’t you do it? You should do it.
Why can’t you do it?

00:32:53.512 --> 00:32:57.115
Like that you take yourself to task and you
can work it out, I’m sure,

00:32:57.316 --> 00:33:00.684
because you have got the power with you.

00:33:01.837 --> 00:33:08.723
I bless you all for your spiritual
development

00:33:08.939 --> 00:33:18.449
and for your collectivity. Both things
must be looked after.

00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:23.081
If you have spiritual development and
no collectivity, it is useless.

00:33:23.312 --> 00:33:29.230
If you have collectivity and spiritual
development none, it is useless.

00:33:29.431 --> 00:33:31.526
Combine it properly.

00:33:31.727 --> 00:33:39.757
So we have to take Shiva and establish Him
into the Virat.

00:33:39.958 --> 00:33:44.332
This is what we have to do, and if you
understand this point,

00:33:44.533 --> 00:33:47.322
your relationships with others also will be
good,

00:33:47.523 --> 00:33:51.078
permanent, of a very substantial nature.

00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:57.810
And the quality of Sahaja Yogis’ life will
be something very, very great.

00:33:58.011 --> 00:34:01.011
May God bless you all.
