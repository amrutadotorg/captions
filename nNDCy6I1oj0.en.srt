1
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,620
 One electromagnetic energy that you have.

2
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,880
 What we call as a “Prana”

3
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,200
 It is the energy from 5 elements.

4
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,920
 It has the energy by which we are today human beings from amoeba

5
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:01,980
 and it has the energy which creates desires within us.

6
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,440
 It has the energy that can cure us

7
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,600
 and redeems us

8
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:29,620
 and the energy that can give us powers so we can do living work.

9
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:50,740
 Sahaja yoga is with that energy which is in totality complete consciousness,

10
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:14,060
 and it is a special time today. You can say in modern times, and there are so many people who are trying to think beyond,

11
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,460
 we can say it is meta modernism,

12
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,380
 no, no, meta modernism

13
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:51,220
 and that is something which shows the wisdom of people who understand that we have to go beyond

14
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:10,500
 and they are not satisfied with what they are but they have to go beyond

15
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:30,180
 and there are so many who feel that their awareness is to be expanded.

16
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:51,740
 In this short time as much as possible I am trying to give you a general picture about Sahaja yoga.

17
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,060
 “Saha” means “with”, and “ja” is born,

18
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,740
 so it is born with you to have this union with that all-pervading power, Sahaja you have.

19
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,180
 It works on all living beings

20
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,100
 and also on energies.

21
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:55,220
 For example, you can improve your agriculture in Sahaja yoga 10 times more,

22
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:11,740
 you can improve your ecological problem through Sahaja yoga,

23
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:30,200
 you can make your animals much more healthier through Sahaja yoga

24
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:40,200
 and you yourself become so dynamic

25
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,620
 and so compassionate

26
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:10,940
 that a scientist becomes a person who works only with all the understanding of limitations of science

27
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,400
 and helps to create a new world.

28
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:35,900
 I must say all the scientific discoveries have helped Sahaja yoga greatly.

29
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,940
 Supposing there were no aeroplanes I did not have come to see you

30
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,700
 if there were no microphones I could not have talked to you

31
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,400
 and these microphones also carry vibrations.

32
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:19,080
 Even on television one can give realization to people.

33
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:32,740
 So all these discoveries you have made has been of such a great help to Sahaja yoga.

34
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,940
 We have developed the watches to save time,

35
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,300
 we save our time to waste it mostly,

36
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:13,020
 and after self-realization, we use it for our spiritual ascent and spiritual growth, growth through meditation.

37
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:36,740
 So I am very much thankful to you all scientists for making these devices which have made it possible to spread Sahajayoga all over the world.

38
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:54,740
 The knowledge of Sahaja yoga is very deep,

39
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,440
 our civilization has grown like a big tree,

40
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,580
 but knowledge of Sahaja yoga is the knowledge of the roots

41
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:26,940
 and if you do not have the knowledge of the roots this great development will be one day under a shock.

42
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:44,560
 So it is important for us to know the knowledge of the roots if we have to survive

43
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,240
 and to enjoy the blessings of science.

44
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:11,380
 I am sorry in this short time I cannot say much but I will be very happy to answer your questions if you have any.

45
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:55,180
 As a scientist, you have to understand everything whatever you do,

46
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,980
 if somebody cures you and cannot explain how

47
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,460
 then you should not accept as a scientist.

48
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,580
 but I know that what happens.

49
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:29,940
 This is something which is not dealt with by scientists so far,

50
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,000
 only in the scriptures they have talked about the soul,

51
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:57,640
 now soul, whatever I am telling you, again, you should accept it as a hypothesis.

52
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:17,080
 Now soul is a composition of 5 elements, the causal of 5 elements

53
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:30,280
 which is placed on the back side of our...it’s an energy form, it’s an energy form

54
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:39,180
 and is placed on the backside of our spinal cord in 7 loops…

55
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:59,840
 after self-realization you can even see the all-pervading power like small commas shining like light,

56
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:19,200
 also you see a kind of loops circular things

57
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:32,200
 and the Sahaja yogis ask Me: what is this?

58
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,900
 I told them these are dead souls.

59
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:49,780
 Now for example we talk of psychosomatic diseases,

60
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:03,320
 also doctors have reached a certain point of understanding that most of the psychosomatic diseases

61
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:12,940
 are caused by something that comes from our collective subconscious.

62
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:38,780
 For example, cancer they say is triggered by a protein 53 and 58. It’s a name they've got.

63
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:06,520
 And they say that it comes from the area which is built within us since our creation,

64
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:24,120
 now, this area which is built within us is the area which we call as collective subconsciousness,

65
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:52,120
 so all the plants which have gone out of the circulation of evolution or who have gone out of the circulation are all existing in that area of collective subconscious,

66
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:27,060
 so when a person who practices what we call as black magic or mesmerism also uses the dead souls

67
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:33,160
 which are around to captivate you.

68
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:51,980
 And people do mesmerize without knowing what effects it will have on human beings.

69
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:06,840
 Now what happens that if you put any such spirit, it can be without the knowledge

70
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:17,740
 of the person who is doing it automatically. It becomes like a [ ] and then the spirit gets out to your system,

71
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:42,840
 now recently they have found out in the science, scientific research that we have all got receptors

72
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:52,440
 and in the receptors these seven loops that I am telling you about are reflected exactly the same way

73
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,080
 I have seen..if you have seen the picture in the same that you see.

74
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:25,440
 And when there are on these loops if there is any effect then what you call as dopamine is created.

75
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:38,620
 Dopamine is a kind of a chemical which gives you epilepsy, it can give you madness can give you all mental problems also other virus and cancer, psychosomatic.

76
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:04,560
 So I, I didn’t know that I would talk to scientists otherwise I would have brought these papers which I have got from America.

77
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:24,160
 So we had about 10 people yesterday, who came from the same gentleman and were suffering from many diseases.

78
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:42,780
 Some had their hands stuck like that they couldn’t walk, some children suddenly stopped talking,

79
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:48,420
 some got their eyes completely scooped in, some got the brain paralysis.

80
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:15,620
 So what happens that you can put one of their or many of these dead spirits on your back on the soul,

81
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:29,640
 and they take over

82
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:42,180
 and when they take over when they try to assert their personality,

83
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:56,760
 so for the time being one may feel elated because there are so many personalities acting for a while,

84
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:10,140
 but after sometime that person becomes exhausted and they recluse...

85
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:26,320
 This is followed by many false gurus in India, we know about it very well because just

86
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,180
 this black magic is too much in India.

87
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:50,880
 But mainly what one has to know, I would say that as a Mother I would say what did you get out of it?

88
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:05,960
 Only temporary curing is not the aim of life,

89
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:19,800
 but you have to be empowered and you have to have full knowledge as to what you are going to be.

90
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,940
 In Sahaja yoga you know all about the centres and it can be good to you.

91
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:43,040
 You can even see with your naked eyes the pulsation of the kundalini,

92
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:48,660
 this power which connects you to the mains.

93
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:00,240
 You can see also sometimes the rising of the kundalini

94
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:10,220
 you can feel the cool breeze coming out of your head, the actualisation of it,

95
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,320
 and you can feel the all-pervading power.

96
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:34,660
 You may be a doctor may not be a doctor but you can give diagnose to others what centres are in trouble.

97
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,300
 There are three channels

98
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,200
 which look after the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system,

99
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,620
 and you can control them,

100
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,360
 you can control your parasympathetic nervous system,

101
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,680
 you can raise the kundalini of others,

102
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,580
 you can cure others,

103
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,780
 yourself you feel extremely peaceful, joyous and happy,

104
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:42,320
 because you develop a new dimension of collective consciousness which Jung has written.

105
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:54,920
 So you become complete knowledgeable like a laboratory you know everything,

106
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:06,840
 it is not just "ah, it is happening. I don’t know how happening" - nothing of that kind...everything can be explained,

107
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,660
 everything becomes logical,

108
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:25,940
 so anything that just cures you is not sufficient,

109
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,680
 in India this art is very well developed

110
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:48,420
 but we know about it so much that we now don’t go to any false people,

111
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:57,520
 so now they are exported all to America,

112
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,780
 They are very gullible

113
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,160
 Americans are very gullible people,

114
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:15,880
 and these people have only interest in money they are money makers.

115
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,140
 Now it’s a living process,

116
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,640
 how can you pay for a living process,

117
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,860
 how much do we pay to Mother Earth for sprouting a seed?

118
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:45,160
 These people have all their interest in money,

119
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:54,840
 and not in giving you the powers

120
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,280
 and the knowledge

121
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,800
 because they haven’t got it.

122
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,640
 So first of all you must see

123
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,880
 what are the disciples like?

124
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,620
 What do they do?

125
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:38,080
 What sort age they are? What sort of body they have?

126
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,700
 How do they talk?

127
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,880
 What is their health?

128
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,520
 Do they know about all this?

129
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,960
 Can they explain it?

130
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,460
 How is their own life?

131
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,460
 You can find out.

132
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,980
 They have to be honest

133
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,220
 and they have to be compassionate,

134
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,960
 so be careful,

135
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:27,580
 so many will come once you have lots of money, there will be a market,

136
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:36,620
 so before anything happen, be careful.

137
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,520
 I am a Mother and you have asked me the question I have to tell you the Truth.

138
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,940
 Eighteen years back I have told this Truth but they would not listen to Me,

139
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,380
 In America I told them about AIDS, I told them about UPI disease is going to come,

140
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:14,300
 I told them about so many diseases they would not listen and now they are down with it.

141
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:28,280
 So what can you do if they don’t want to listen to you, you can’t help it.

142
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:39,340
 If they are bent upon their destruction then what can you do? They have all the freedom.

143
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:54,820
 Or somebody asked me how to go to hell, all types of questions they ask,

144
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,440
 I said take two running jumps and you are there.

145
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,960
 So it is like this,

146
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:21,240
 For getting your realization you have to first ask for it, I have to respect your freedom

147
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:28,640
 and it’s not a guarantee that you will get it at first shot.

148
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,000
 But if you are earnest it will work out

149
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:54,580
 and then once you are fully connected, no problems of any kind.

150
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,400
 I found Russians to be very wise people,

151
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:16,660
 and I feel that a day will come when Russians will be most powerful people spiritually.

152
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:29,280
 The country is not powerful by weapons but by the powerful peoples.

153
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:04,120
 I have to .. his question is still not answered.

154
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:19,820
 After realization, we become very sensible and satisfied people,

155
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,600
 and we develop a balance

156
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:36,960
 then we realize that the machines are for us and we are not for machines

157
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:48,400
 so we produce as much as we want,

158
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:59,200
 and whatever is necessary we produce through machines or we produce through our hands.

159
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,160
 So a balance is.

160
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:16,000
 As a result of that, the pollution goes down.

161
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:28,980
 Now in Spain there are five motor factories,

162
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:50,000
 now on the road you will find in car only one person is sitting, in every car,

163
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:05,640
 because so many cars are produced every day, cars are cheap so they buy a car and an ego is saying: now I've got a car!

164
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:29,720
 The father must have one car, mother must have one car, the child must have one car, the grandmother must have one car

165
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:36,200
 and they never meet each other,

166
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,960
 no rapport, no relationship,

167
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:51,820
 they live with their cars with their pretty girls and with a suitcase.

168
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,720
 So, after realization we become collective,

169
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:12,260
 there may be three cars but everybody would like to go together in one car,

170
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,400
 they want to live collectively

171
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,640
 because they enjoy each other.

172
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,480
 Now Sahaja yoga is working in forty nations,

173
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:38,040
 and they want to live in Indian villages,

174
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:52,180
 And light it with a spark. I mean you cannot do anything there,

175
00:36:54,100 --> 00:37:03,740
 but they enjoy it having their baths in the flowing rivers and living in the nature absolutely very happy and comfortable.

176
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:21,200
 They wear few clothes of cotton or pure silk or cotton whatever they can afford, not too many things they don’t have in their house

177
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,520
 like plastics,

178
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,860
 mountains and mountains

179
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,640
 and they don’t know how to destroy it,

180
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,780
 and Sahaja yogis don’t drink,

181
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,940
 so only one glass is sufficient for one man,

182
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:03,420
 for drinking we have to have one..., another one, another one, another one,

183
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:14,000
 and too many choices because of ego.

184
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,900
 In the morning the mother will ask what will you have?

185
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:29,000
 One child will say this, another this another that,

186
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,880
 and if that is not in the fridge the child will start shouting,

187
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:47,280
 Formally the mother used to cook for everyone the same thing

188
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:54,800
 and everybody had to eat that and enjoy it,

189
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:04,380
 because we have lost our collective enjoyment, we have become like this.

190
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,200
 Now these entrepreneurs are also making fool of us,

191
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:32,400
 first they will start that you should wear very tight pants,

192
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:45,940
 so you develop varicose veins,

193
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:54,280
 so they will say alright make pants with holes in it

194
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,580
 so everybody starts wearing them,

195
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,560
 they go on changing fashions because their machines have to run,

196
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:21,900
 and we have no personality, we all want to be fashionable, what is the need?

197
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,440
 So we have piles of clothes,

198
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:44,220
 you go to an English home, as soon as you enter all pile will fall on you first of all.

199
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:55,540
 So, this matter is only for one purpose,

200
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,620
 is for expressing your love,

201
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:07,260
 like today we had a birthday,

202
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,020
 so we gave him a tea set,

203
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:19,820
 and I got some necklaces for all of you,

204
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:27,600
 and I enjoy very much giving them,

205
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,280
 that’s the only advantage of matter,

206
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,000
 otherwise possessions are headaches.

207
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:55,660
 So, how ecological problems has come by? Because of greed and lust.

208
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:12,160
 After Sahaja yoga, you get everything beautiful and enjoy everything,

209
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:31,220
 because you feel that this has become a holy water now, everything becomes holy, auspicious,

210
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:43,540
 only thing which are auspicious, which emit vibrations Sahaja yogis will have it,

211
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:51,660
 all auspicious things are benevolent

212
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,320
 so the ecological problem is solved.

213
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:23,920
214
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:53,280
215
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:54,680
  So first question is that some diseases can be cured through Sahaja yoga  - as raising the kundalini.

214
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:19,300
 Yesterday there was a lady with multiple sclerosis. And she could not stand on her..

215
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:33,580
 and we raised her kundalini, she had problems on her centres,

216
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:41,320
 we corrected the centres raised her kundalini, gave her realization and she got alright,

217
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:59,600
 and then she still [ ] that she was sick so she was holding onto the chair

218
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:06,540
 I said now you get up and walk, and she then started walking so fast, everybody saw.

219
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:22,060
 Most of them get cured,

220
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:26,040
 but some of them do not.

221
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,020
 Now, first of all, you have to get your self-realization,

222
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,860
 then you have to come to our collective program

223
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:59,000
 and then you have to master Sahaja yoga

224
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:07,000
 when you start do it, then you can cure others.

225
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:12,100
 But Sahaja yoga is not for curing,

226
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,460
 it is for self-realization

227
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,460
 and when you get your self-realization as a bioproduct

228
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:35,160
 then you can become alright because when the kundalini rises She passes through these centres and nourishes them.

229
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:11,040
 Shri Mataji, if there were some psychological research done relating to influence Sahaja Yoga on people?

230
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:22,480
 Is it possible to see the findings of this research? And may I get Your blessing to conduct such research in center of Sahaja Yoga in Moscow?

231
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:17,220
 ...here accepted for research but if you want to do it otherwise you can do it by using Sahaja yoga methods

232
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:32,440
 to cure people who are suffering from psychosomatic diseases or depressions or anything by treating them and then noting down their improvements.

233
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:16,860
 We have here a saint scientist doctor from England, he is here and he can tell you about it.

234
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:22,880
 And we are all experimenting with many things. Is he here doctor Wells?

235
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:35,900
 Alright, you come and see he is now running seven hospitals, London.

236
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:57,000
 Now we have many doctors here and I think we should meet them who have come from abroad...we should call them.

237
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:12,480
 aap aaiye( you please come), We have doctor Talwar? ..Dr. Talwar?

238
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,880
 Dr Talwar from Delhi.

239
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:28,420
 Now we have Dr Ramzad Ali,

240
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,020
 He is from the U.K.

241
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,700
 And he is a great student of medicines actually.

242
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,880
 He has done a lot of studies.

243
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,500
 Then we have Dr Neelam,

244
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:55,760
 from India.

245
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,840
 Then we have Dr Sarah,

246
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:13,820
 then we have got a diplomat from UN, Gregoire.

247
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:23,660
 Then in Russia, we have got Dr Bogdan.

248
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,660
 Today is his Birthday.

249
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,720
 He has sacrificed his job

250
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,820
 in India and he is now here,

251
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,640
 working it out for Russia.

252
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:11,600
 We hope to see some sense of scientists also for you from America.

253
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,880
 They’ll explain many more things to you,

254
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:25,400
 also we will send you some papers that they have written.

255
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:21,440
 And second - is Sahaja Yoga is universal science, which includes Hatha, Raja and other yogas or it is some new principle?

256
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,500
 I should say I was born with this knowledge.

257
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:20,500
 The second question is about all other yogas.

258
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:36,000
 Now Hatha yoga is meaning “Ha” and “Tha” meaning the sun and the moon both lines, both energies,

259
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:49,340
 but in modern times the Hatha yoga they are practising is only of one side,

260
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:04,420
 moreover the one who started hatha yoga was known as Patanjali,

261
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:20,920
 so thousands of years back he’s written a book so big as that so thick,

262
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:35,700
 in that he has written that there are Ashtangas, there are eightfold of yoga, eight aspects, spiritual paths,

263
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:49,340
 out of that yama niyama is the one which is just a wee bit,

264
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:57,300
 yama niyama, is control and the laws

265
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:15,880
 and out of that very wee bit are the exercises,

266
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:25,200
 now we also use those exercises,

267
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:34,960
 but later on throughout he has talked about Sahaja yoga,

268
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:45,020
 first you get thoughtless awareness and then doubtless awareness.

269
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:57,760
 In those days they used to only have one or two disciples,

270
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:07,760
 and they cleansed their all centers and then raise their kundalini,

271
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,900
 and it could take years together.

272
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:34,980
 But now in the Sahaja yoga today,

273
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:44,440
 I have evolved a method by which first you raise the Kundalini somehow,

274
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:57,720
 and in that little light, give them little light they see what’s the problem with that

275
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:06,060
 and just tell them how to correct

276
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,620
 so they can correct their own problems.

277
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,000
 In those days people have no time

278
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,340
 and people are very obstinate also

279
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:35,680
 so now supposing there’s darkness and you are holding the snake in your hand

280
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:49,920
 and I say now there is a snake in your hand, you won’t listen to Me, you won’t throw it away till it bites you.

281
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:58,280
 You will say it’s a rope,

282
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,360
 so the best thing is to put little light,

283
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:11,980
 so you see the snake and throw it away yourself.

284
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:17,760
 This is today’s Sahaja yoga

285
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:26,800
 but it’s the same what he achieved after so many years you can achieve it yourself in a very short time,

286
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:44,180
 and also as we have developed speed I think kundalini has also developed speed.

287
01:00:49,160 --> 01:01:03,780
 We call it this as jet times and the kundalini is also a jet kundalini, we call it as a jet, Jet Times, jet. How do you translate this

288
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:24,340
 I am myself surprised, it works en masse.

289
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,840
 Yesterday there were 10,000 people,

290
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:41,400
 and I think 95% of people got realization 95.

291
01:01:49,960 --> 01:02:04,720
 But we do tell you exercises when the kundalini rises, then we tell you if there is any physical problem what exercises to be done, it’s all scientific.

292
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:29,440
 But this way these days the way people do hath yoga, they just take all the medicine from the medicine box without knowing what is to be taken without discretion.

293
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,740
 Now another is Raja yoga.

294
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:54,500
 I went down to California and I saw some doctors whom I knew have cut their tongue.

295
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:13,840
 and they told me that they had to cut it to do a thing called “khechari” to take back the tongue

296
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,100
 to raise the kundalini.

297
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:32,100
 So now when the kundalini rises it is like the ignition of a car,

298
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:48,060
 and when the car is ignited all the machinery works by itself, you don’t have to do anything.

299
01:03:55,020 --> 01:04:02,020
 So what they do is to put back the tongue thinking by doing that the kundalini will rise,

300
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:19,160
 and poor things now can’t speak can’t eat very difficult,

301
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:30,720
 so it is like moving the wheels without starting the car, will it move?

302
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:39,500
 It’s all artificial,

303
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:43,960
 nobody gets realization in that

304
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,040
 because it’s a living process,

305
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:56,140
 now there’s integral yoga,

306
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:01,620
 that is all mental.

307
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:08,160
 Talking about yoga how can you get your realization?

308
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:18,420
 Supposing if you talk to the Mother Earth will she give us flowers?

309
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:29,060
 Talk..talk..talk..talk..talk..that’s all.

310
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:37,980
 People get fed up with that talks, books after books like this so many.

311
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:48,680
 So far I have not written any book for the same reason,

312
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:59,300
 then we have another one you call that one? It is transcendental meditation,

313
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:05,360
 that is the worst I tell you

314
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:21,800
 We had four people from transcendental,

315
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:33,380
 the man was the director of a flying foundation in Scotland,

316
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,800
 to get a mantra

317
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:51,740
 and the mantras were told in secret

318
01:06:54,640 --> 01:07:02,040
 and the mantras were rare, funny ones “Inga, Pinga, Thinga”,

319
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:13,840
 it has no meaning, it is not Sanskrit, it has no meaning but it has funny meaning also

320
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:24,920
 Inga means the scorpion’s bite

321
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:36,420
 and Pinga means when you get possessed you go round and round like that, that is Pinga

322
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,900
 and Thinga means when you show like this to someone,

323
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:55,800
 300 pounds for that,

324
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:05,300
 and 6000 pounds for flying halfway.

325
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:17,140
 What a stupidity, what is the need to fly halfway you already have traffic jams,

326
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:37,800
 then they were given to drink the water which boiled which boiled potatoes for six days

327
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:50,120
 then the rings of potato rings,

328
01:08:56,540 --> 01:09:00,400
 and the last day was given the potatoes to eat.

329
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:13,760
 But this director, his wife, his daughter and a deputy director all got epilepsy,

330
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:23,500
 so they came here.

331
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:31,880
 Luckily my husband has gone on a tour so they stayed in my house

332
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:42,740
 and with my treatment they got cured.

333
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:58,200
 They had lost all their money, this man was a diamond merchant, he had lost all his money his wife was a granddaughter of a Duke, she has lost everything.

334
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:05,500
 What is this lady…please tell her to sit down

335
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:19,380
 and a granddaughter who was the granddaughter of a Duke and this man became bankrupt.

336
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:40,460
 So and the director and the deputy director became bankrupts

337
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:46,860
 and he is now gone to South Africa and writing a book.

338
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:55,300
 The name of the book is “How we were befooled”.

339
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:10,140
 This t.m. and now they begin Ayurveda.

340
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:26,420
 They are marketing it now marketing it,

341
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:34,840
 there is no need for them to market anybody can take to Ayurveda,

342
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:50,020
 but for Ayurveda, you cannot do it here, you have to go to India because the herbs that are used for curing you cannot grow here.

343
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:10,720
 So, just that just trying to I don’t know what are they up to, I just don’t know, they can’t bring Ayurveda here.

344
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:22,160
 India, Indian medicine,

345
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:42,440
 I mean it is a common sense everybody knows in India that you can’t do Ayurveda anywhere else but in India.

346
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:56,140
 I think they will now give some sort of this to you in the name of Ayurveda and they will buy it.

347
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:09,280
 or they give may be some water which has boiled the potatoes.

348
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:23,300
 One should know all these things. There’s another one who gives diabetes, supposing.

349
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:37,600
 only to people who are very big cheats in India

350
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:49,400
 the horrible people who .. they are cheats.

351
01:13:55,660 --> 01:14:03,640
 If he is so good why doesn’t he solves our problem financial problem in India?

352
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:09,480
 Why doesn’t he solves some  of our financial problem?

353
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:18,400
 All these people who doing it get heart trouble.

354
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:25,680
 I am telling you everything frankly,

355
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:30,940
 they will never talk against each other.

356
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:39,300
 Christ has said that the house of Satan will never speak against itself.

357
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:57,360
 But they will speak against Me they do!

358
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:15,400
 They make like that.

359
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:27,320
 They may speak against Me and tell you that I must be a dark force or something, they might,

360
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:37,400
 because it is their business, they will be using money when I am here.

361
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,400
 Alright, Thank you very much.
