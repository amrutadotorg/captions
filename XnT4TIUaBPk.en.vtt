00:00:33.514 --> 00:00:36.215
Actually when you turn your eyes here and there,

00:00:36.215 --> 00:00:37.819
when your attention is here and there

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:41.163
it is nothing but your ego that is trying to overpower you.

00:00:44.715 --> 00:00:48.853
So like that, try to permeate into each other and see the beauty.

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:52.502
And you'll enjoy yourself the best because that is the biggest thing.

00:00:52.502 --> 00:00:56.263
That's the biggest thing that is to be achieved.

00:00:56.263 --> 00:01:00.112
Because this ego you know makes you like a nutshell

00:01:00.112 --> 00:01:04.655
and you just cannot have a rapport with that beauty of permeation

00:01:04.655 --> 00:01:08.397
and just see how the notes move into each other.

00:01:18.108 --> 00:01:25.248
So the basis of all creativity, of Saraswati, is love.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.606
If there is no love there's no creativity.

00:01:30.365 --> 00:01:33.514
It's even in the deeper sense, you see.

00:01:33.514 --> 00:01:35.698
People who have created

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:40.832
all the scientific things are also out of love for the masses,

00:01:41.173 --> 00:01:42.657
not for themselves.

00:01:42.657 --> 00:01:45.266
Nobody has produced anything for themselves.

00:01:45.577 --> 00:01:47.804
If they make something for themselves

00:01:47.804 --> 00:01:50.286
it has to become for universal use,

00:01:50.286 --> 00:01:52.266
otherwise it has no meaning.

00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:55.668
Even if you say atom bomb and all these things that are created

00:01:55.668 --> 00:01:56.731
from science,

00:01:56.731 --> 00:01:59.367
they are also very protective.

00:01:59.367 --> 00:02:03.454
If they had not created those, people would not have taken out their minds

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:07.577
from war. Now, nobody can think of having a big war.

00:02:07.577 --> 00:02:09.794
Of course, they are having cold wars,

00:02:09.794 --> 00:02:13.145
but that also will gradually stop, when they will be fed up.

00:02:13.145 --> 00:02:17.478
So, all the activity on the right hand side, of Saraswati,

00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:20.465
basically has to end up in love.

00:02:20.465 --> 00:02:23.192
Starts with love and ends up in love.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.628
Whichever does not end up in love

00:02:25.628 --> 00:02:29.948
coils up and finishes off. It just disappears.

00:02:30.227 --> 00:02:35.033
So you can see that even matter, which is not used for love,

00:02:35.033 --> 00:02:39.498
just finishes off. The basis has to be love.

00:02:39.498 --> 00:02:42.477
Otherwise all such matter that we create

00:02:42.745 --> 00:02:44.480
which has angularity,

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.014
which is not fitting into the mass media

00:02:49.014 --> 00:02:51.474
which is not appealing to the masses,

00:02:51.718 --> 00:02:55.334
of course, it takes time, you have seen that it takes time

00:02:55.536 --> 00:03:01.854
but it does have that tendency always to disappear in the thin air

00:03:01.854 --> 00:03:05.660
as soon as you find it does not appeal to the masses.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.294
Now this love of, that we talk of,

00:03:09.294 --> 00:03:11.663
this great love of God we talk of,

00:03:11.663 --> 00:03:15.377
we know it for definite through vibrations.

00:03:15.377 --> 00:03:17.347
People do not have vibrations,

00:03:17.347 --> 00:03:22.921
but still they can feel the vibrations in a very unconscious way.

00:03:22.921 --> 00:03:26.489
All the great paintings of the world have vibrations.

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.606
All the great creative works of the world have vibrations.

00:03:29.875 --> 00:03:34.457
Only those who have vibrations have been sustained by time,

00:03:34.457 --> 00:03:37.038
otherwise all other things are destroyed.

00:03:37.038 --> 00:03:38.706
There must have been monuments

00:03:38.706 --> 00:03:41.448
and horrible statues and horrible things

00:03:41.448 --> 00:03:43.417
that have been created long time back.

00:03:43.417 --> 00:03:45.939
But they were all destroyed by nature,

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:51.840
and they could not stand the impact of the Kala

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.628
that is the destructive power of time.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.373
So, all that is sustaining, all that is nurturing,

00:03:59.652 --> 00:04:06.847
all that is ennobling, comes from this sense of love,

00:04:06.847 --> 00:04:11.424
which is within us very much developed, but within others also,

00:04:11.424 --> 00:04:13.725
who are not yet realized.

00:04:13.725 --> 00:04:16.831
Ultimately the whole world has to realize that

00:04:16.831 --> 00:04:19.684
one has to go to that ultimate love of God,

00:04:19.684 --> 00:04:22.370
otherwise it has no meaning.

00:04:26.173 --> 00:04:30.686
Saraswati cleanses all that is impure in nature,

00:04:30.887 --> 00:04:35.691
while, with our brain activity, we are spoiling all that.

00:04:35.691 --> 00:04:41.015
All our brain activity goes against pure intelligence.

00:04:41.293 --> 00:04:45.222
And that's what one has to understand

00:04:45.222 --> 00:04:50.204
that this pure intelligence, is not to be soiled by our thinking.

00:04:50.204 --> 00:04:53.523
Our thinking can make us so bumptious,

00:04:53.523 --> 00:04:58.905
so ego-oriented, so impure,

00:04:59.155 --> 00:05:07.439
that, we can really eat the poison and say 'what is wrong with it'?

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:09.730
Just the opposite of Saraswati.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.713
If Saraswati is within us, She gives us Subuddhi, wisdom.

00:05:14.115 --> 00:05:18.064
And that is why to worship Saraswati, to worship Surya;

00:05:18.064 --> 00:05:21.589
we must have that clear vision as to what we have to be.

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:25.210
What we are doing. What filth we are living in.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.395
What our mind is getting into.

00:05:27.395 --> 00:05:29.715
After all we are here for emancipation

00:05:29.715 --> 00:05:31.916
and not for just for pampering our ego

00:05:31.916 --> 00:05:34.916
and living with our filth that is with us.

00:05:34.916 --> 00:05:37.205
So this light has come within us

00:05:37.205 --> 00:05:39.294
and we should try to rise above

00:05:39.294 --> 00:05:46.736
our own mental filth, which is being created around us.

00:05:47.127 --> 00:05:48.269
Apart from that,

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:55.427
you have to go higher and understand that there is,

00:05:55.898 --> 00:05:57.301
within us,

00:05:57.502 --> 00:06:00.578
a thing called ego.

00:06:00.578 --> 00:06:04.351
And this ego is false, absolutely false. You do not do anything.

00:06:04.351 --> 00:06:07.067
Actually when you turn your eyes here and there,

00:06:07.067 --> 00:06:08.908
when your attention is here and

00:06:08.908 --> 00:06:12.900
there it is nothing but your ego that is trying to overpower you.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.364
But actually ego is an absolute falsehood

00:06:17.364 --> 00:06:22.047
because there is only one ego and that is of God Almighty,

00:06:22.047 --> 00:06:24.211
Mahatahamkara.

00:06:24.211 --> 00:06:30.122
There is no really any ego that exists. It is myth.

00:06:30.122 --> 00:06:31.797
It is a very big myth,

00:06:31.797 --> 00:06:34.604
because if you start thinking you are doing everything

00:06:34.604 --> 00:06:36.416
you are doing this, you are doing that

00:06:36.416 --> 00:06:38.300
which you are not doing;

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:43.090
then this nonsensical ego comes in and you start working it out,

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.083
it can project in every direction.

00:06:45.083 --> 00:06:49.112
When it projects forward, it overpowers others,

00:06:49.112 --> 00:06:55.256
it tries to dominate others, tries to kill others, becomes cruel.

00:06:55.256 --> 00:06:59.281
When it moves [to the] right side, it becomes supraconscious.

00:06:59.281 --> 00:07:02.392
It starts seeing things, which are absurd,

00:07:02.642 --> 00:07:04.574
which are foolish, which are stupid.

00:07:04.574 --> 00:07:09.725
When it moves left side then it starts talking

00:07:09.725 --> 00:07:16.242
I mean, seeing things - yourself as a big man, as a big Christ

00:07:16.242 --> 00:07:20.530
or as a big Devi or something like Adi Gurus

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.480
and 'I am a very great personality' that is left sided.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.116
When it moves backwards, that is the dangerous one.

00:07:27.116 --> 00:07:31.593
When people become gurus, which are ruining other people.

00:07:31.593 --> 00:07:34.715
When their ego moves backwards then they become gurus,

00:07:34.916 --> 00:07:37.370
they themselves have lots of defects in themselves

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:44.227
and they try to pull people into those horrible stuff,

00:07:44.227 --> 00:07:44.356
which is described as absolute Naraka.

00:07:44.868 --> 00:07:48.007
That's how, is the movement of ego on all the sides.

00:07:48.315 --> 00:07:53.789
Now when people try to use their right Vishuddhi

00:07:53.997 --> 00:07:57.723
that is, to talk about themselves, is the worst of all.

00:07:57.723 --> 00:08:00.907
Whatever type of ego you may have,

00:08:00.907 --> 00:08:03.736
if you start boasting about it and talking about it,

00:08:03.736 --> 00:08:07.941
then it encircles, thickens the walls of ego so much,

00:08:07.941 --> 00:08:11.772
that it is impossible to penetrate into that.

00:08:11.772 --> 00:08:14.884
Because such a person is completely satisfied with himself

00:08:14.884 --> 00:08:17.274
and he believes that he is so.

00:08:17.274 --> 00:08:20.501
And once he starts believing into a nonsense like that,

00:08:20.501 --> 00:08:25.026
it's an impossibility, is an impossibility to penetrate.

00:08:25.026 --> 00:08:31.842
So, when you boast about these things or you talk big, be careful.

00:08:31.842 --> 00:08:36.413
You see, you know what I am, but how many times do I say 'I am that'?

00:08:36.413 --> 00:08:40.752
Even if I say once, it makes tremendous vibrations for you.

00:08:40.752 --> 00:08:42.906
But how many times do I say so?

00:08:42.906 --> 00:08:47.103
At the most if you say something, I say 'yes'.

00:08:47.103 --> 00:08:49.222
But I don't say that. If I say it loudly,

00:08:49.222 --> 00:08:53.526
I don't know what may happen. The whole thing might be blasted with that.

00:08:53.526 --> 00:08:58.255
So, one has to understand that Mahatahamkara is the one that acts,

00:08:58.255 --> 00:09:01.701
that works, that creates. Sometimes I shout at you.

00:09:01.701 --> 00:09:04.680
Immediately all the bhoots run away. Just once I shout.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.506
Yesterday, you saw all the bhoots that were coughing, they all ran away.

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:09.883
Yesterday just I started.

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:13.719
So you should understand that now you are a realized souls,

00:09:13.719 --> 00:09:15.124
you can also do the same.

00:09:15.124 --> 00:09:17.292
Use your right Vishuddhi to shout at yourself,

00:09:17.292 --> 00:09:18.925
Now will you please stop boasting,

00:09:18.925 --> 00:09:20.848
will you stop talking all this nonsense,

00:09:20.848 --> 00:09:25.695
will you stop showing off! Then it will stop.

00:09:25.695 --> 00:09:34.187
Now this thickening takes place by people who really are active.

00:09:34.187 --> 00:09:36.543
Who want to do something about it, not that they are not active.

00:09:36.543 --> 00:09:39.859
They want to do it. But they know only one way,

00:09:39.859 --> 00:09:41.172
is to act talkative.

00:09:41.172 --> 00:09:43.702
They don't understand that there are inner ways

00:09:43.702 --> 00:09:49.019
by which you control it much more.

00:09:49.019 --> 00:09:53.552
Because they don't want to take to that, they take to this talking.

00:09:53.758 --> 00:09:56.455
And once they take to talking and they talk about it,

00:09:56.455 --> 00:09:59.512
the whole power goes.

00:09:59.512 --> 00:10:02.900
But if they do not talk about it and keep it within themselves.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.406
It's alright, you can tell Me about your experiences or anything,

00:10:07.406 --> 00:10:10.714
but if you start telling others, and talking about it too much,

00:10:10.714 --> 00:10:15.506
then the powers that you have got will all be disappearing gradually.

00:10:15.506 --> 00:10:19.855
And you will just come down to absolutely lowest level.

00:10:19.855 --> 00:10:21.902
So one should not too much talk

00:10:22.119 --> 00:10:25.449
that 'I have this power, I have this power' or 'I see this'

00:10:25.449 --> 00:10:28.098
or 'I do this,' which is a very wrong thing.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.215
I warn you, don't try to show off.

00:10:31.215 --> 00:10:33.981
Yes, you can talk about My powers. It is all right.

00:10:33.981 --> 00:10:37.174
But don't try to talk about your powers.

00:10:37.174 --> 00:10:40.371
When it comes, of course, to talk to somebody

00:10:40.371 --> 00:10:43.230
who is a negative person or to tell somebody,

00:10:43.479 --> 00:10:45.220
then you should say that 'we', not 'I'.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:50.792
'We' have, some of us have felt this power within us.

00:10:50.792 --> 00:10:52.834
'We have seen people'. It may be you only,

00:10:52.834 --> 00:10:55.489
but you need not say, 'I' have.

00:10:55.489 --> 00:10:59.325
What you have to say is 'We'. Then you become the Mahatahamkara.

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:01.683
When you say 'We', Yes some of us', 'we do'.

00:11:01.683 --> 00:11:07.444
Like in Gregoire's book also I made it, I saw to it,

00:11:07.444 --> 00:11:10.622
that he should not have many 'I's', but he should have 'We'.

00:11:10.622 --> 00:11:13.445
'We think', 'we do', 'we'.

00:11:13.445 --> 00:11:16.938
Means, the whole collective being, the whole collective organism,

00:11:16.938 --> 00:11:20.078
living organism of Sahaja Yogis.

00:11:20.078 --> 00:11:22.523
So if you say, 'yes, some of us have got it',

00:11:22.523 --> 00:11:25.774
that means, you put yourself down, but put all others above you.

00:11:25.774 --> 00:11:28.530
Say: 'Yes, some of us have. I know some people have this.'

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.592
Thats the way one should do it.

00:11:30.592 --> 00:11:33.279
Because if you have to overpower your ego,

00:11:33.279 --> 00:11:38.114
you must allow it to spread into everybody else.

00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:40.861
That's how you will make it perfectly all right.

00:11:40.861 --> 00:11:43.850
Let it spread. 'We, all Sahaja Yogis, we all'.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:46.848
But that pride is not there. I've seen that pride is not there.

00:11:46.848 --> 00:11:48.396
Still it is very individualistic.

00:11:48.396 --> 00:11:52.204
If you start thinking, 'we Sahaja Yogi',

00:11:52.204 --> 00:11:55.075
then what happens, that you become one personality,

00:11:55.075 --> 00:11:56.715
one organization.

00:11:56.715 --> 00:11:59.706
But the person will look down upon other people.

00:11:59.977 --> 00:12:03.041
He will see that this person is low, that person is higher,

00:12:03.041 --> 00:12:06.022
that person is there.

00:12:06.022 --> 00:12:09.796
But he will not think 'We' the Sahaja Yogis, how beautiful we are.

00:12:09.796 --> 00:12:11.309
'We' the body of Sahaja Yoga,

00:12:11.806 --> 00:12:13.272
how beautiful we are.

00:12:13.661 --> 00:12:20.377
So always think in the words of 'we',

00:12:20.377 --> 00:12:25.117
so your ego will become much less, much less, much less.

00:12:25.117 --> 00:12:29.050
And the same ego, which looked so funny and absurd,

00:12:29.281 --> 00:12:33.010
will form tomorrow, the Ekadesha.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:40.697
Today's individual ego will merge into Ekadesha.

00:12:40.697 --> 00:12:44.457
But we all must remember to say 'we' all time.

00:12:49.145 --> 00:12:52.573
So that is how we have to take a mood

00:12:52.573 --> 00:12:56.629
by which we should think of one personality, all of us together,

00:12:56.629 --> 00:13:00.513
all of us together. And anybody who tries to be something

00:13:00.513 --> 00:13:03.763
separate or different, he will drop out.

00:13:03.763 --> 00:13:06.963
I will drop him out. Whatever it may be, it will drop out.

00:13:06.963 --> 00:13:08.923
So you just don't worry yourself,

00:13:08.923 --> 00:13:11.253
anybody who tries to be singled out or anything.

00:13:11.253 --> 00:13:14.899
Everybody must do whatever they like, to nurture the whole,

00:13:14.899 --> 00:13:20.311
to help the whole, to emancipate the whole. But not to, in anyway,

00:13:20.311 --> 00:13:23.636
put anyone down. Always.

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:27.240
Because this is not the way the Sahaja Yoga is.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.783
Sahaja Yoga only works in collectivity.

00:13:29.783 --> 00:13:34.684
And the one who has developed this permeating spirit,

00:13:34.684 --> 00:13:37.940
is a real Sahaja Yogi. Who has not, is not!

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:41.341
Whatever you may think of yourself, I have nothing to say.

00:13:41.341 --> 00:13:45.151
But this permeating personality, which moves from places to places,

00:13:45.151 --> 00:13:46.598
whether, you talk or not. Like your Mother is.

00:13:47.855 --> 00:13:49.763
Whether I meet you or not, makes no difference,

00:13:49.763 --> 00:13:54.080
but I am permeating through all of you, by little, little things, also,

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.753
I am there with you.

00:13:55.753 --> 00:13:59.664
So like that, try to permeate into each other and see the beauty.

00:13:59.664 --> 00:14:01.536
And you'll enjoy yourself the best because

00:14:01.536 --> 00:14:04.142
that is the biggest thing.

00:14:04.142 --> 00:14:07.076
That's the biggest thing that is to be achieved.

00:14:07.076 --> 00:14:10.756
Because this ego you know makes you like a nutshell

00:14:10.756 --> 00:14:15.392
and you just cannot have a rapport with that beauty of permeation

00:14:15.392 --> 00:14:19.340
and just see how the notes move into each other.

00:14:19.547 --> 00:14:20.959
It will be a great idea today,

00:14:20.959 --> 00:14:23.814
it's great thing today [that] we are having Puja in Dhulia.

00:14:23.814 --> 00:14:28.839
Like the Dhulia means the dust, dust.

00:14:28.839 --> 00:14:34.239
And one day I had written in childhood, a poem, I remember.

00:14:34.239 --> 00:14:37.205
Very interesting poem it was - I don't know where it is now –

00:14:37.205 --> 00:14:42.055
but which said that I want to be like a dust particle

00:14:42.055 --> 00:14:45.800
which moves with the wind. It goes everywhere.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.840
Can go, sit on the head of a king,

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.979
or can go and fall at the feet of someone.

00:14:51.979 --> 00:14:55.784
And it can go and sit on a little flower,

00:14:55.784 --> 00:14:58.314
and it can go and sit everywhere.

00:14:58.314 --> 00:15:01.308
But I want to be a particle of dust

00:15:01.308 --> 00:15:07.813
that is fragrant, that is nourishing, that is enlightening.

00:15:07.813 --> 00:15:10.453
Like that, I had written a very beautiful poem,

00:15:10.453 --> 00:15:12.904
I must have been about seven years of age, I remember

00:15:12.904 --> 00:15:17.455
'To be a dust particle', I remember that very clearly,

00:15:17.455 --> 00:15:20.978
long time back, that I should be a dust particle.

00:15:20.978 --> 00:15:25.207
So that I'll permeate into people.

00:15:25.207 --> 00:15:29.047
Which is a very big thing - to become a dust particle of that kind.

00:15:29.047 --> 00:15:33.807
Whatever you touch, you see, that becomes (inaudible)

00:15:33.807 --> 00:15:39.593
whatever you just feel, that has fragrance.

00:15:39.593 --> 00:15:41.781
It's such a great thing to be like that.

00:15:41.781 --> 00:15:46.079
And that was My desire, and it has been achieved.

00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:50.562
At that young age, I had this idea of becoming a dust particle

00:15:50.562 --> 00:15:53.555
and today just while talking to you, I remembered

00:15:53.818 --> 00:15:57.952
that I wanted to be that, and that is what this place is.

00:15:57.952 --> 00:16:01.136
And Raulbai is like that. She's a very simple woman,

00:16:01.136 --> 00:16:06.408
very simple woman, and she lives like a very simple person

00:16:06.408 --> 00:16:09.110
but she has a sense of permeation.

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:12.422
And now there are so many Sahaja Yogis, yesterday who came.

00:16:12.422 --> 00:16:15.161
I am sure that they will take up, Sahaja Yoga, very well.

00:16:15.161 --> 00:16:20.516
And there are lots of Sahaja Yogis from Dhulia now,

00:16:20.516 --> 00:16:22.979
and I am sure there are going to be more people.

00:16:22.979 --> 00:16:26.117
I hope you have met all of them. Make friends with all of them.

00:16:26.117 --> 00:16:27.804
Try to know them who they are.

00:16:27.804 --> 00:16:31.026
They may not know English - so get somebody to translate.

00:16:31.026 --> 00:16:34.584
Talk to them and be nice to them, be friendly with them.

00:16:34.584 --> 00:16:37.068
I wanted you to meet them for permeation.

00:16:37.068 --> 00:16:40.015
You should know who are the people here, who are in Nasik.

00:16:40.015 --> 00:16:43.506
Because somehow we never meet the Sahaja Yogis, you see,

00:16:43.506 --> 00:16:45.587
who are in that particular place,

00:16:45.587 --> 00:16:47.609
and when we go back we have only one or two addresses.

00:16:47.609 --> 00:16:50.750
It is not a good idea. Try to see how many people there are.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:54.195
Ask questions about them, and all that.

00:16:54.195 --> 00:16:56.399
This permeation is only possible

00:16:56.601 --> 00:16:59.685
when your ego starts permeating all around,

00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:04.169
and this is the way to overcome the problems of the right side

00:17:04.169 --> 00:17:06.600
and that is how to worship Saraswati.

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.378
Because Saraswati has a Veena in Her hand

00:17:09.378 --> 00:17:12.605
and that Veena is the primordial instrument,

00:17:12.605 --> 00:17:14.493
which She plays like music,

00:17:14.493 --> 00:17:16.300
and the music penetrates into the heart.

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.889
You don't know how it goes into you and how it works out.

00:17:18.889 --> 00:17:24.448
And that’s how a person who is a Sahaja Yogi should permeate

00:17:24.448 --> 00:17:27.100
like music into other people.

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:30.319
She has so many qualities, as I told you, which cannot be described

00:17:30.319 --> 00:17:35.825
in one lecture. But one of the greatest qualities of Hers is

00:17:35.825 --> 00:17:40.195
that She ends up into subtler things.

00:17:40.195 --> 00:17:45.589
Like the Mother Earth will end up into fragrance,

00:17:45.589 --> 00:17:49.507
music will end up into melodies.

00:17:49.507 --> 00:17:53.194
Like that, whatever She creates ends up into something greater.

00:17:53.194 --> 00:17:57.121
Matter, whatever She produces, ends up into aesthetics.

00:17:57.121 --> 00:18:00.864
If matter does not have aesthetics then it is gross.

00:18:00.864 --> 00:18:04.425
Like that everything. Now you will say what is water.

00:18:04.425 --> 00:18:07.494
Water becomes the river Ganges.

00:18:07.494 --> 00:18:10.509
These are the subtler things.

00:18:10.509 --> 00:18:12.614
So the matter gets into subtler thing

00:18:12.614 --> 00:18:16.047
because it has to permeate, it has to permeate.

00:18:16.047 --> 00:18:21.799
So everything whatever it is. And the best of all is the air.

00:18:22.034 --> 00:18:25.810
That air becomes the vibrations.

00:18:29.132 --> 00:18:32.766
So you can see how, whatever has come out from this matter,

00:18:32.766 --> 00:18:38.275
from these five elements, becomes that subtle thing.

00:18:38.275 --> 00:18:41.976
Of course, the left and right side both work it out

00:18:41.976 --> 00:18:43.673
because the love

00:18:43.673 --> 00:18:46.808
has to work on this and when love acts on matter

00:18:46.808 --> 00:18:49.094
it becomes that.

00:18:49.337 --> 00:18:53.564
And that is how one has to look at your own lives,

00:18:53.564 --> 00:19:00.371
to make it a beautiful combination of love and matter.

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:02.098
May God bless you!
