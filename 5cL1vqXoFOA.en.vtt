THE ROLE OF WOMEN IN SOCIETY

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.867
Question: What is the role of woman in this
world, the role of feminine principle?

00:00:29.078 --> 00:00:33.023
Shri Mataji: I would say, I don’t say that
women as women who are born as women

00:00:33.224 --> 00:00:35.336
only have the role, even the men have,

00:00:35.537 --> 00:00:38.574
everyone has, because everyone has
Kundalini within them.

00:00:38.775 --> 00:00:43.847
But the women must know that if they are
women, they have a greater responsibility.

00:00:44.048 --> 00:00:47.433
Not that they should sit at home and only
look after children and brood

00:00:47.634 --> 00:00:51.222
and then nag the husbands when they come
home.

00:00:52.964 --> 00:00:58.972
That’s not their role. Their role is such
that they have to be forbearing.

00:00:59.181 --> 00:01:04.004
Any person who is the mother has to be
like the Mother Earth.

00:01:04.181 --> 00:01:06.926
How much She is forbearing! How much
She suffers!

00:01:07.127 --> 00:01:12.871
We dig Her out, we torture Her life still
She is giving all the time;

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:16.387
She is soothing, forgiving, bearing it up,
you see.

00:01:16.588 --> 00:01:20.566
Then we are doing so many sinful things, I
mean, She should explode realyl with anger,

00:01:20.767 --> 00:01:23.972
the way it is. But She does not, She is
very careful,

00:01:24.142 --> 00:01:29.066
She slowly, slowly informs that, “Now get
out of this place, it’s rumbling”.

00:01:29.267 --> 00:01:32.441
She is so kind, you see? That all should
come to us.

00:01:32.642 --> 00:01:36.887
So it’s not that it is only the women who
should settle down with these qualities,

00:01:37.088 --> 00:01:39.566
but the time has come that men have to have
these qualities.

00:01:39.767 --> 00:01:42.019
Otherwise, there will be always
an imbalance.

00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:46.316
The women have no self-esteem, they fight
on wrong things,

00:01:46.517 --> 00:01:51.043
they don’t fight on the right things.
The right is that you should be respected

00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:54.191
and you should not be treated like
something on the show, that any man

00:01:54.392 --> 00:01:58.347
can look at you and any, and that the men
should look at you,

00:01:58.548 --> 00:02:01.285
then you have some value. It’s nonsense.

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:07.887
This is not the way to make great nations
and great children and great families.

00:02:08.056 --> 00:02:15.050
So the society of any country depends
on the women, which is a very solid work,

00:02:15.251 --> 00:02:18.105
which is underground, they don’t want
to show off.

00:02:18.306 --> 00:02:22.863
Any country, which has got good women
make good societies.

00:02:23.048 --> 00:02:26.996
So in Sahaja Yoga we respect the women,
we allow them their own freedom,

00:02:27.197 --> 00:02:30.599
we trust them and we treat them equal.
They have to be equal.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.465
They may not be similar but they are
equal.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.597
The both the wheels have to be equal
otherwise wheel,

00:02:36.798 --> 00:02:40.706
one is smaller, one is bigger, then
the chariot will never move forward,

00:02:40.907 --> 00:02:43.628
it will go round and round and round.
So that is to be understood,

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.566
that’s very much important nowadays
in the West because I find

00:02:48.767 --> 00:02:52.581
slowly the derailment is towards hell.

00:02:52.782 --> 00:02:56.472
All these thoughts are going to take people
to nowhere

00:02:56.673 --> 00:03:02.207
because nobody takes the responsibility
of molding a moral,

00:03:02.408 --> 00:03:06.409
creating moral values for children.
You have to give proper breeding.

00:03:07.457 --> 00:03:12.465
You don’t know the role of a woman is so
important, so very important

00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:19.816
that she can change the whole family
into a beautiful garden.

00:03:20.017 --> 00:03:30.379
It is her own sweetness, her own creative
mind of love that can work it out.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:37.402
Must find out the art of love and work it
out on anybody

00:03:37.603 --> 00:03:44.277
who is disturbed, or who is unhappy,
or who is crossed.

00:03:44.478 --> 00:03:51.363
You can do it. You should know how
to pacify that person and how to impress.

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:55.839
First quality you must have is
the generosity of character.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.558
You should not mind giving up anything
to anyone if they want.

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:06.527
You will enjoy your generosity now and
in that you should be generous

00:04:06.728 --> 00:04:11.582
when you forgive others. Forgiveness is
very important,

00:04:11.783 --> 00:04:16.672
and then you will never feel the brunt
of your married life.

00:04:16.883 --> 00:04:20.875
Forgive. Also you have to forgive
yourself.

00:04:21.045 --> 00:04:25.910
Not to feel guilty, not to feel guilty
at all about anything.

00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:31.691
You should not be source of some sort
of a dominating personality

00:04:31.892 --> 00:04:34.769
or a person who is aggressive,
not at all.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.082
On the contrary, you are the one who can
bear lots of things

00:04:40.283 --> 00:04:43.910
and make a fun out of every nonsense
that you see.

00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:50.941
Nothing is so serious to fight it, but
to make a fun out of all that

00:04:51.142 --> 00:04:53.646
and make a fun for everyone.

00:04:53.847 --> 00:04:57.261
That’s what you have to be, always smiling
and happy.

00:04:58.738 --> 00:05:14.006
[Question on the equality of women
in India, and women’s rights].

00:05:14.207 --> 00:05:19.129
Shri Mataji: Now, you see, our style and
culture is different, what I’m saying.

00:05:19.337 --> 00:05:23.379
The thing is that woman is regarded -
I mean, not nowadays of course

00:05:23.587 --> 00:05:27.409
because it’s different - but most
of the women in the villages are regarded

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:36.855
as sakshat Lakshmi, means Mother Goddess
of wealth. So she is to be respected.

00:05:37.056 --> 00:05:40.894
All the people will respect, you see,
nobody dare insult her.

00:05:41.095 --> 00:05:45.027
That was our society and it’s still
in the villages like that.

00:05:45.228 --> 00:05:50.738
And the women feel very proud that they
are housewives. They are proud

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:55.441
because we are housewives, we have our
children, we can look after our children,

00:05:55.642 --> 00:05:59.957
we can cook, we can - they are great cooks
also.

00:06:00.158 --> 00:06:06.129
So you see, what happens, that they know
that their area is their household,

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.980
but they don’t feel suffocated. They don’t
feel they are lowered down.

00:06:10.285 --> 00:06:15.652
In Sanskrit there’s a saying, “Yatra narya
pujyante, tatra ramante devata”:

00:06:15.853 --> 00:06:23.058
meaning “Where the women are respected,
are worshipped and they are worshipful” –

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:28.394
not that they are to be worshipped, but
they are respectable –

00:06:28.595 --> 00:06:34.558
“there only exists the Kingdom of God.”

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:39.402
So, so much responsibility is on women.

00:06:40.361 --> 00:06:44.888
Now, the men are responsible
for the politics and the economics

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:55.024
and also the nation as administrators,
but women are responsible for the society.

00:06:56.379 --> 00:06:59.668
Whether she is in the house or she is
outside,

00:06:59.869 --> 00:07:03.441
whether she is working in the house
or outside,

00:07:03.642 --> 00:07:12.066
she is responsible for the maintenance
of the society.

00:07:12.588 --> 00:07:17.958
And there it looks as sometimes to a woman
that she is dominated,

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:22.941
that her husband dominates her, that
the husband’s family dominates her,

00:07:23.142 --> 00:07:29.558
but it’s the quality of a woman that
brings up the level of the society -

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:36.254
not only the level, but also in the family
she is then respected.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:44.301
It’s a very important role as a housewife;
perhaps we never realize it.

00:07:44.502 --> 00:07:49.504
Now we see so many lights here, electricity
is there running.

00:07:49.705 --> 00:07:52.980
But what is the source of this
electricity?

00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:57.613
Is it not much more important than
these lights?

00:07:57.814 --> 00:08:02.972
So men are nothing but, we can say,
the kinetic energy,

00:08:03.173 --> 00:08:06.972
but what is the potential is the woman
of the house.

00:08:07.587 --> 00:08:10.991
So it is for us, at this moment,
to understand the value

00:08:11.192 --> 00:08:14.866
of this great power that is given to us
by our Creator.

00:08:15.067 --> 00:08:18.358
But what do we find? Whether in the East
or in the West,

00:08:18.559 --> 00:08:22.522
women have not been able to give a full
manifestation of their greatness.

00:08:22.737 --> 00:08:27.091
I am not suggesting at all that the only
role of women in human society

00:08:27.292 --> 00:08:31.130
is that of the mother, the procreator
and the preserver of children,

00:08:31.331 --> 00:08:35.903
or that of a wife, or a sister. Women have
a full right to participate

00:08:36.104 --> 00:08:39.786
as equal partners in every aspect
of life -

00:08:39.987 --> 00:08:44.919
social, cultural, educational, political,
economical, administrative and the rest.

00:08:45.149 --> 00:08:48.434
In order to prepare themselves for this
all-pervading role,

00:08:48.635 --> 00:08:52.530
they must have the right to education
in all branches of knowledge.

00:08:52.731 --> 00:08:55.809
But if they are mothers, they have a great
responsibility

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.481
towards their children as well as their
society.

00:08:58.698 --> 00:09:01.879
Men are responsible for politics and
economics of the country,

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:06.952
but women are responsible for the society.
Women can also support men

00:09:07.153 --> 00:09:10.520
and they can make leading part,
of course, in any post,

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.583
but it is very important that they should
not forget they are women

00:09:14.784 --> 00:09:19.498
who have to manifest deep motherly concern
and love. If they become manly

00:09:19.699 --> 00:09:24.216
and aggressive, the balance of the society
cannot be maintained.

00:09:25.885 --> 00:09:30.005
At the same time, I must admit that,
while we ask for the rights of women,

00:09:30.213 --> 00:09:34.286
we must also stress the fundamental duties
of women to the human society.

00:09:34.487 --> 00:09:40.380
The women in the West, or those who are
educated in the West,

00:09:40.572 --> 00:09:45.966
also some others are educated, have gone
to the other extreme

00:09:46.167 --> 00:09:51.028
when they are taking to political,
economical or administrative roles.

00:09:51.229 --> 00:09:55.856
To compete with men they have become
much too self-willed,

00:09:56.057 --> 00:10:00.277
self-centered and ambitious. They have
no more their soothing,

00:10:00.478 --> 00:10:04.669
pleasing qualities which can bring peace
and balance.

00:10:06.026 --> 00:10:12.833
So as you have got your Kundalini, you must
develop that sweetness within you,

00:10:13.034 --> 00:10:21.528
in such a manner that people see you and
think that you are great Mothers,

00:10:21.729 --> 00:10:29.575
but as you know in the West the mothers are
so horrible, the women are so dominating

00:10:29.776 --> 00:10:34.966
that people do not have a proper image
of a mother also.

00:10:35.314 --> 00:10:40.645
Women are extremely dominating. Women
must learn to dominate, it's so easy!

00:10:40.846 --> 00:10:46.020
A bull can dominate anybody. But can they
be like Mother Earth,

00:10:46.449 --> 00:10:55.149
which can bear up all kinds of troubles,
all kinds of problems?

00:10:57.339 --> 00:11:00.852
Can we do that way?

00:11:01.586 --> 00:11:04.902
Especially that's why I request women
of this country

00:11:05.103 --> 00:11:09.386
to develop those beautiful qualities and
not of domination.

00:11:09.587 --> 00:11:15.886
Domination, it doesn't behove a woman,
it doesn't look nice on her.

00:11:16.087 --> 00:11:22.144
It's like a bull, she is wearing as
a diamond piece around her neck,

00:11:22.355 --> 00:11:26.458
it's not beautifying. So we must give up
that idea

00:11:26.659 --> 00:11:32.552
of dominating or trying to oppress
the husband. He says something,

00:11:32.753 --> 00:11:38.956
we say "no", to children, we say "no",
to everyone we try to dominate.

00:11:39.157 --> 00:11:44.456
That's not our character. Even, I think
Roosevelt once said

00:11:44.657 --> 00:11:48.009
that, of course he must have met real
Indian women,

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:55.499
that an Indian woman she is like a magnolia
in an Indian forest.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:59.311
Of course, here the magnolias are useless
but in Indian forest,

00:11:59.512 --> 00:12:05.936
even one flower in the forest, it is
hidden, you can't see it,

00:12:06.762 --> 00:12:10.936
but you can smell it. The whole forest
is fragrant,

00:12:11.137 --> 00:12:17.271
you can't see it anywhere, it's' hidden,
even one flower, you can know this magnolia.

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:21.335
And this is the greatest quality,

00:12:21.536 --> 00:12:26.167
because love is the most attractive thing
in this world.

00:12:26.474 --> 00:12:30.163
Why do you hang around Me?

00:12:35.183 --> 00:12:40.944
Just ask yourself. Because I have
vibrations? My photograph has got.

00:12:42.319 --> 00:12:47.772
No. You feel that you are loved, that
I love you.

00:12:47.973 --> 00:12:52.553
It's a very great quality. But I have that
innate within Me,

00:12:52.754 --> 00:12:56.694
I don't have to have it from anywhere
and you, too, have it.

00:12:56.895 --> 00:13:00.171
Just expose it and manifest it.

00:13:00.372 --> 00:13:03.764
May God bless you. Thank you.
