We may have many concepts about our
religion or caste or race but these are

00:00:17.243 --> 00:00:25.251
only concepts. Every human-being has within
him the desire to want to be one with God.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.850
That desire, if it is strong enough, it
will be fulfilled and in Her presence,

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:39.469
that desire can actually manifest itself,
you do get connected, you feel the vibrations,

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:44.130
you feel the silence, deep silence within,
which is the thoughtless awareness.

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:51.409
Then, of course, how they take it forward,
is left to them. It is an individual's own

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:57.394
sense of responsibility and the strength of
his or her own desire, to take it forward.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:23.250
India is blessed by people who believe that
there is God and one has to be surrendered

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.892
to God and one has to try to get closeness
to God but that's what it is. The rest of

00:01:29.892 --> 00:01:37.501
it is, we are divided into many, many
castes, many, many religions, many sects

00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:47.113
and much ritualism. And when you break out
of that and we realize it we are all people,

00:01:47.113 --> 00:01:53.791
who are born from this earth of India and
that we can all achieve a sense of realization

00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:58.696
and can get close to a sense of God,
then it will change the way

00:01:58.696 --> 00:02:01.163
Indians also work with each other.
