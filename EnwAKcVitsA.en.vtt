WEBVTT

08:01.072 --> 08:04.691
All these years

08:09.091 --> 08:14.600
I have been waiting for this day.

08:20.342 --> 08:27.881
We have now, on the twenty-first
Sahasrara,

08:30.824 --> 08:39.514
so is a very important turning point

08:39.715 --> 08:53.433
as you know that every twenty-first day
we change our calendars

08:53.745 --> 08:57.923
as far as the horoscope is concerned.

09:01.618 --> 09:07.044
And so now is a new change has to come

09:08.408 --> 09:12.382
and you can see the announcement.

09:19.001 --> 09:30.750
A new understanding and awareness
of a very new dimension.

09:32.228 --> 09:40.165
We have been so far dealing with collective
consciousness.

09:41.969 --> 09:45.314
We are collectively conscious.

09:45.515 --> 09:57.135
We have the idea that we are collectively
conscious.

09:58.821 --> 10:05.669
Also we know we are part and parcel
of the whole

10:08.617 --> 10:14.439
and that we all are sahaja yogis.

10:14.640 --> 10:25.477
We know about our chakras and our nadis
very clearly,

10:26.654 --> 10:31.841
but perhaps we do not know about our
powers,

10:32.706 --> 10:38.610
how many powers have developed in those
twenty-one years within yourself.

10:51.074 --> 10:57.367
Last two months Italy was burning with
fire, it was so very hot.

10:57.568 --> 11:01.375
And I read reports that they are worried
about a drought

11:01.652 --> 11:07.848
and they want rain to come in and now
they think the time has passed away.

11:11.772 --> 11:21.729
But how it works, you see, because the
All-pervading Power knows everything

11:21.935 --> 11:28.359
and the whole nature works for your
benefit, for your programmes.

11:28.560 --> 11:32.365
At the right time things happen, as you
have seen before.

11:32.566 --> 11:38.494
They are completely coordinated with
our programmes.

11:38.695 --> 11:40.886
All the time they are helping you.

11:41.087 --> 11:44.955
Whatever they have in themselves as powers,

11:45.156 --> 11:49.246
they are using them at the right time.

11:49.447 --> 11:58.049
Now be confident that you have powers.

11:58.250 --> 12:10.061
And this is the new change that is going
to come within your own understanding.

12:10.262 --> 12:14.989
So far only you knew that you could feel
the vibrations,

12:15.190 --> 12:20.884
that you could cure people, you could
help to cure -

12:21.085 --> 12:30.404
I mean, still not so confident that you
could feel the Paramchaitanya.

12:32.478 --> 12:38.101
But you did not know what dynamic Forces
are working in you now

12:38.302 --> 12:42.700
and this is the new change that is going
to come.

12:42.901 --> 12:47.594
With this new change, you have to assume
a new character,

12:47.795 --> 12:51.267
and the new character is announcement.

12:51.481 --> 12:58.767
So far I had told you not to talk about
Sahaja Yoga very openly, blatantly,

12:59.087 --> 13:04.734
but now the time has come. We waited
long for these days.

13:04.949 --> 13:08.253
Now you have to all start talking about it,

13:08.454 --> 13:12.018
announcing about it and telling about it
to everyone.

13:12.219 --> 13:18.137
Otherwise, the world would say that,
“We never knew about it!”

13:18.741 --> 13:25.841
All other false gurus are so well known
all over because their disciples

13:26.032 --> 13:29.867
are talking about them [in] all the places,
wherever they can.

13:30.068 --> 13:35.073
To all the big offices they go, to big
people they go.

13:35.274 --> 13:40.369
They go to all the important people. [They]
just go and tell them what they have.

13:40.560 --> 13:44.325
So far we had kept Sahaja Yoga at a low ebb

13:44.546 --> 13:48.455
because I wanted you, first of all,
to develop

13:48.656 --> 13:55.167
into really very beautiful sahaja yogis,
so that from your life,

13:55.368 --> 14:01.583
from your lifestyle, from your behaviour,
from your understanding,

14:01.784 --> 14:08.444
from your thoughts, people will realise
that these people are very unique

14:09.741 --> 14:13.938
and very different type of people.

14:14.740 --> 14:21.207
Now that assumption has to be there.

14:21.701 --> 14:28.856
You have to understand that all these
powers are bubbling in you

14:29.037 --> 14:34.491
and just out of formality or maybe out
of shyness

14:34.692 --> 14:40.705
or maybe little cowardice, you are hiding
them.

14:40.906 --> 14:44.297
The other day there was a sahaja yogi
who came to my house

14:44.497 --> 14:51.628
and he saw some flowers which were
fading away.

14:51.830 --> 14:56.102
I said, “They are not fading. You can give
them life.” He said, “How?”

14:56.303 --> 15:02.865
I said, “You cut the bottom of all of them
and put your hand underneath.”

15:03.056 --> 15:08.132
[Aside to someone: Take these children
away. Just what book he has got?]

15:12.224 --> 15:22.653
And he just put his hands under the base
of the stem

15:22.854 --> 15:24.948
and he said, “Mother, they are still
drooping.” I said, “All right,

15:25.149 --> 15:28.046
now leave them in the water.”

15:28.247 --> 15:29.442
His attention was here and there,

15:29.643 --> 15:33.625
within fifteen days (minutes?) they all
stood up all right,

15:33.826 --> 15:37.255
started growing, they became bigger
flowers,

15:37.456 --> 15:41.846
and lasted for five days more after that.

15:42.047 --> 15:45.377
Then he was convinced.

15:47.318 --> 15:55.075
You can do so many things to convince
yourself that you have these powers.

15:55.276 --> 15:59.469
I have seen people who have certain
problems.

15:59.670 --> 16:03.323
They have a headache, they have this, that.
They come to me,

16:03.524 --> 16:08.622
write big letters, “Mother, I get my
headache. I can’t get rid of it.”

16:08.823 --> 16:13.079
Now those days are gone when Mother has
to cure your headache,

16:13.280 --> 16:19.055
look after your wife, look after your
children. Is all finished now.

16:19.256 --> 16:24.234
Now you are responsible, not only
for yourself,

16:24.435 --> 16:31.841
but for your ashrams, for your cities,

16:32.055 --> 16:36.789
for your countries and for the whole world.

16:37.297 --> 16:40.416
Now, assume your powers.

16:40.617 --> 16:46.523
Like yesterday he sang, or he played,
‘The Royal Court’ (Nishat Khan).

16:46.753 --> 16:51.405
So now you are in The Royal Court. Take up
your responsibilities!

16:51.606 --> 16:58.003
Everybody has to feel responsible.
And assume what you are.

16:58.227 --> 17:03.364
Know your powers, what you can do.
Sit down.

17:03.565 --> 17:07.775
Now, the days are gone when you had
to sit down and count your blessings.

17:07.976 --> 17:10.939
Now you have to count your powers:

17:11.155 --> 17:16.571
“How many powers I have and what I can
use and how I can use.”

17:16.802 --> 17:20.470
No use counting your miracles. You have
had enough miracles to prove

17:20.661 --> 17:25.858
that you are sahaja yogis and that you are
helped by the Paramchaitanya.

17:26.059 --> 17:28.761
But now know how much of that
Paramachaitanya

17:28.961 --> 17:32.806
you are going to use yourself, how you
are going to manoeuvre it

17:33.007 --> 17:36.526
and how you are going to work out.

17:37.553 --> 17:44.311
This is the New Era we are starting
from today.

17:44.512 --> 17:49.905
And this is the day I was waiting for all
of you to realise

17:50.106 --> 17:54.193
that you are not sahaja yogis for only
your selfish ends,

17:54.394 --> 17:59.425
nor for your families, nor for your
communities,

17:59.626 --> 18:02.656
nor for your country, but for the whole
world.

18:02.857 --> 18:06.827
Expand yourself. You must have that vision
before you,

18:07.028 --> 18:10.473
that I have put many a times before
you people,

18:10.674 --> 18:13.520
that – you have to emancipate the humanity.

18:13.721 --> 18:16.316
Now don’t have diffidence.

18:16.517 --> 18:21.191
First of all, you should not think that,
“We are very ordinary people.

18:21.392 --> 18:25.601
We are very ordinary. We haven’t got
something special about it.”

18:25.802 --> 18:28.150
This work is not going to be done
by special people

18:28.350 --> 18:32.101
because they are suffering from ego.

18:32.302 --> 18:35.866
It is going to be done by people who don’t
have that ego

18:36.067 --> 18:42.780
of great success or of great achievements
or riches or anything.

18:42.981 --> 18:47.102
If they are rid of this, then only they can
work it out.

18:47.303 --> 18:51.708
And that’s why it is for you to understand
what Christ has said

18:51.909 --> 19:03.267
that a camel can pass through the hole
of a needle, but not a rich man.

19:03.468 --> 19:07.035
Because the ego is too big, bigger than
a camel, bigger than an elephant,

19:07.236 --> 19:10.813
any animal you could think of.

19:11.014 --> 19:15.687
That’s why now as we are entering into
new awareness,

19:15.888 --> 19:22.830
let us not worry about our negative
thinking.

19:24.103 --> 19:29.774
So, first is the diffidence: “How can I be?
I am not all right.

19:29.975 --> 19:35.066
I was like this. I was doing like this.
I had done like this.”

19:35.288 --> 19:38.019
So many letters of confessions come to me,

19:38.220 --> 19:42.133
pages after pages, which I throw away
or burn them off.

19:42.334 --> 19:45.637
There is no need to confess any more.
There’s only one confession,

19:45.838 --> 19:49.888
that “I am a sahaja yogi and now, after
twenty-first of Sahasrara,

19:50.089 --> 19:53.250
I am a Maha Yogi.”

19:54.945 --> 19:57.197
This is the confession you have to make.

19:57.398 --> 20:01.454
And no more of all these out-of-date things
that people tell me

20:01.655 --> 20:05.413
about your family’s life and all mundane,
nonsensical things.

20:05.614 --> 20:08.997
We have given them up and we have come
to Sahaja Yoga for our ascent.

20:09.198 --> 20:14.136
We have achieved our ascent and now
for what? For what?

20:14.337 --> 20:19.612
Have achieved our ascent is to emancipate
human beings,

20:19.813 --> 20:26.816
to help them out of the mire of ignorance,
of darkness.

20:27.706 --> 20:36.758
The main target, I feel today, should not
be so much political as fundamentalism.

20:36.959 --> 20:40.045
So we have to openly say to these
fundamentalists

20:40.246 --> 20:42.271
that, “You are nonsensical. You don’t know
the truth.

20:42.472 --> 20:46.057
You don’t know anything about truth.
You don’t know that you are the Spirit.

20:46.258 --> 20:48.334
You don’t know that there is a power
that is working.”

20:48.535 --> 20:52.152
You have to tell them very clearly,
“You are all stupid people

20:52.353 --> 20:55.218
running after something that is a mirage

20:55.419 --> 20:59.540
and all of you will end up into hell
as described by all the scriptures.”

20:59.741 --> 21:02.449
We have to openly say it, this thing.

21:02.650 --> 21:04.334
Whichever way you like, you may write
books.

21:04.535 --> 21:07.124
You may publish it. You may tell people
about it.

21:07.325 --> 21:10.110
But now the new announcement has to come
to say

21:10.311 --> 21:16.107
that running after falsehood is not going
to take you to God.

21:16.758 --> 21:21.686
And, in that, they have used the power
of hatred.

21:21.887 --> 21:24.599
So you have to say that, “We believe
in the power of love

21:24.800 --> 21:27.844
and not in the power of hatred that you
believe in.”

21:28.045 --> 21:32.791
For us, everybody is capable of finding
the Truth

21:32.992 --> 21:42.800
and is capable of getting to the heaven
of that paradise,

21:43.001 --> 21:46.109
which is promised to us, the Kingdom
of God.

21:46.310 --> 21:50.811
So, for us, everybody, whether they belong
to this community, that community,

21:51.012 --> 21:55.323
this race or that race, whatever it is,
we believe –

21:55.524 --> 22:01.159
not that – but we are sure, that we all
are quite capable

22:01.360 --> 22:06.316
and blessed by God, that we should enter
into His Kingdom.

22:06.517 --> 22:12.507
If you take this kind of a positive
attitude, your negativity will go away.

22:12.708 --> 22:15.599
Negative forces, as you know, you have
been pulled down

22:15.800 --> 22:21.573
by this kind of a thing or that kind of
a thing, specially after Sahaja Yoga.

22:21.774 --> 22:24.559
Before Sahaja Yoga, we are not attached
to any families or anything.

22:24.760 --> 22:29.302
After Sahaja Yoga you just got attached
to your families, like glued to them.

22:29.503 --> 22:34.259
Absolutely glued. I mean, I had to solve
everybody’s family problems.

22:34.460 --> 22:37.815
Now we have marriages and even after
marriages I find

22:38.016 --> 22:40.790
[that] still people don’t understand what
is a Sahaja Yoga marriage.

22:40.991 --> 22:45.171
And there are still some problems —
very few, but there are.

22:45.372 --> 22:50.881
So this nonsensical problem of “my family,
my wife, my children,

22:51.082 --> 22:57.150
my house, my property, my money,” all this
“my” should be finished first of all.

22:57.351 --> 23:02.988
You have to belong to the world. Any person
who is a king,

23:03.189 --> 23:07.744
[who] does not belong to his kingdom
is a failure, is useless.

23:07.945 --> 23:13.900
If he thinks about himself, about his own
comfort, about his own fame,

23:14.101 --> 23:18.369
about his own achievements, then
he is a failure.

23:18.570 --> 23:23.671
He has to think about the country on which
he is ruling.

23:23.872 --> 23:28.171
In the same way, you have to also turn
your mind away

23:28.372 --> 23:31.591
from all these petty things that you have
been dealing with.

23:31.792 --> 23:33.810
I have been struggling with you, trying
to help you

23:34.011 --> 23:36.464
for every small little nonsensical things.

23:36.665 --> 23:38.682
And many people said that, “Mother,
why should You worry?

23:38.883 --> 23:40.905
You are a saint. Why should You worry
about these things?”

23:41.106 --> 23:44.454
I said, “Unless and until these
entanglements are taken away,

23:44.655 --> 23:46.025
they are not going to come out.”

23:46.226 --> 23:51.602
But now, now you do feel that freedom,
complete freedom.

23:51.803 --> 23:54.878
You are an individual. You are absolutely
free

23:55.079 --> 23:57.964
and the source of your joy is your Spirit.

23:58.165 --> 24:00.247
You are not entangled with anyone.

24:00.448 --> 24:03.258
You are not any way attached to anyone.

24:03.459 --> 24:07.205
In that detachment, you are going
to nourish everyone,

24:07.406 --> 24:10.629
inclusive of so-called your family, your
people,

24:10.830 --> 24:13.603
your country and ultimately the world.

24:13.834 --> 24:21.951
So, to get rid of negativity, first
important thing is to learn detachment.

24:22.152 --> 24:25.296
Detachment comes through thoughtless
awareness.

24:25.497 --> 24:28.631
When you look at anyone or start thinking
about anyone –

24:28.874 --> 24:31.551
get to your state of thoughtless awareness.

24:31.752 --> 24:37.180
Immediately you’ll feel detached and you’ll
know the solution of the whole problem.

24:37.381 --> 24:42.703
Now the greatest power you have is in your
brain, that you are knowledgeable.

24:42.904 --> 24:45.199
Not knowledgeable the way you understand,

24:45.400 --> 24:48.370
that, “what is the chakra, what is
the centre” — not that.

24:48.571 --> 24:50.872
But there is all knowledge within you.

24:51.073 --> 24:55.335
Just you have to get into thoughtless
awareness

24:55.536 --> 24:58.468
and the whole library of knowledge can
open to you.

24:58.654 --> 25:02.419
You know, so many of you have never been
speaking on the stage,

25:02.620 --> 25:06.790
they had stage fear, and you have become
great speakers.

25:06.991 --> 25:11.264
So many of you were possessed people
who couldn’t even stand before me,

25:11.478 --> 25:16.329
have now become leaders and are doing
good job.

25:16.530 --> 25:20.583
In every field you will find that you have
advanced so much.

25:20.764 --> 25:24.144
So many people who never knew how
to sing have started singing,

25:24.345 --> 25:26.601
did not know how to paint have started
painting.

25:26.802 --> 25:30.603
But these are very, very mundane things

25:30.804 --> 25:34.054
which may give us little pleasures here
and there,

25:34.255 --> 25:38.761
but the main thing is how many people
we give Realisation to.

25:38.962 --> 25:41.227
Whether you are a woman, whether you
are man,

25:41.428 --> 25:43.783
whether you are a father, whether you are
a mother,

25:43.984 --> 25:47.255
whether you are a child or a grown up.

25:47.456 --> 25:51.470
Everybody has to see how many people
we can give Realisation to,

25:51.671 --> 25:56.383
how much we can announce about Sahaja
Yoga. That’s the main thing.

25:56.584 --> 25:59.462
Sahaja Yoga is not by the way. And it
happens.

25:59.663 --> 26:02.378
Like, when I went to Australia, I was
surprised

26:02.579 --> 26:06.037
that Sahaja Yoga, which was such a prime
thing for them,

26:06.238 --> 26:10.965
suddenly became by the way. So Sahaja
Yoga is a commitment,

26:11.166 --> 26:14.306
is a commitment and complete involvement.

26:14.507 --> 26:17.985
Otherwise you are really useless for Sahaja
Yoga, absolutely useless.

26:18.186 --> 26:20.867
It’s better to have few people who are
committed

26:21.068 --> 26:24.373
than to have thousands who are just
useless.

26:24.574 --> 26:28.343
So let us see what you have decided
for yourself

26:28.544 --> 26:31.452
and what you have decided for Sahaja Yoga.

26:31.653 --> 26:33.946
If you have decided to opt for Sahaja Yoga,

26:34.147 --> 26:38.246
then just know that this is the main thing
which you have to do.

26:38.450 --> 26:41.605
The whole attention should be on that.

26:41.806 --> 26:46.430
As I told this morning, a very good poem
written by Namadeva

26:46.631 --> 26:51.434
and was included in the Guru Granth Sahib,

26:51.635 --> 26:55.278
that, “A boy is playing with his kite and
the kite is flying in the air.

26:55.479 --> 27:00.349
He’s talking to everyone, but his attention
is on the kite.

27:00.550 --> 27:03.655
There’s a lady who is doing all
the household work.

27:03.856 --> 27:07.515
She is doing all the cleaning, but
the child is on her,

27:07.716 --> 27:13.124
on her back or on her waist. All her
attention is on the child.

27:13.325 --> 27:16.120
Then there are ladies who are taking
water home.

27:16.321 --> 27:21.054
There’s a water pitcher on their heads,
sometimes two, sometimes three.

27:21.255 --> 27:24.704
They’re carrying, balancing it. They’re
talking to each other, laughing,

27:24.905 --> 27:26.901
but the whole attention is on the balance.”

27:27.102 --> 27:31.607
In the same way, your attention should be
all the time on Sahaja Yoga –

27:31.808 --> 27:35.092
“What’s happening in Sahaja Yoga?
Where are we? Where are we going?

27:35.293 --> 27:39.907
Where is Mother? What part She is?
What is She doing?”

27:41.602 --> 27:48.901
That is, now, if you put your attention to,
your negativity will absolutely disappear

27:49.102 --> 27:53.049
because attention which was involved
into negative things

27:53.250 --> 27:58.546
will get absolutely detached and you’ll
start thinking about Sahaja Yoga.

27:58.747 --> 28:02.971
So now, as you are Maha Yogis, we have
to make it a Mahayoga.

28:03.172 --> 28:06.142
And unless and until that level is achieved
by you,

28:06.343 --> 28:08.722
then we should think that you are still
backdated

28:08.923 --> 28:15.860
and I don’t know, in the turning of the
wheel, how many will be left there.

28:16.061 --> 28:20.433
So this is a very big turning point and
today is a very great day for us

28:20.634 --> 28:27.456
because Sahasrara, today, has completed
its twenty-one years

28:27.657 --> 28:32.402
and, like that, it has twenty-one aspects.

28:32.603 --> 28:37.738
Seven, the chakras. Seven into three
of your nadis.

28:37.939 --> 28:45.469
So it’s twenty-one aspects you have been
able to achieve and the twenty-one powers.

28:45.670 --> 28:48.236
You just experiment and see for yourself.

28:48.437 --> 28:51.088
Don’t doubt yourself! Just experiment.

28:51.289 --> 28:54.147
First, you used to even doubt if there is
cool breeze or not,

28:54.348 --> 28:57.754
used to think it’s an air conditioner
working in London!

28:57.955 --> 29:02.949
Even [in] London, they used to think there
must be an air conditioner in their head!

29:03.150 --> 29:05.234
Now those days are gone!

29:05.435 --> 29:10.233
Now don’t doubt yourself and just go
full ahead

29:10.434 --> 29:15.932
with all the maryadas of Sahaja Yoga.
So the maryada has to be there.

29:16.133 --> 29:27.458
Except that the moral maryadas and also
of behavioural maryadas,

29:27.659 --> 29:30.469
there are not many maryadas in Sahaja Yoga.

29:30.670 --> 29:33.782
You can do what you like. You can live
the way you like.

29:33.983 --> 29:36.326
You can eat the way you want to eat.

29:36.527 --> 29:41.554
But the main maryada is that you have to be
very moral people, honest, moral people.

29:41.755 --> 29:50.625
And, also, you have to be, in a way,
in appearance, in behaviour,

29:50.826 --> 29:54.485
such a person that you do not become
obnoxious,

29:54.686 --> 29:59.422
or people don’t think you are queer,
strange people.

29:59.623 --> 30:02.900
To overcome that, we have to dress up
in a way

30:03.101 --> 30:07.596
that is rather more appealing to
the general public

30:07.797 --> 30:14.038
and people see us as normal human being
and as not abnormal human beings.

30:14.239 --> 30:17.668
There’s not much to be done outside.
It is the inside

30:17.869 --> 30:21.816
where we’ll have to prepare ourselves
fully, to accept ourselves,

30:22.017 --> 30:26.297
to tell ourselves every day that we are
now Maha Yogis

30:26.498 --> 30:28.748
and we have to work it out that way.

30:28.949 --> 30:31.732
Today we have here people from all over
the world

30:31.933 --> 30:35.053
and you go and tell this message to all
the rest of the people,

30:35.254 --> 30:39.191
whom I have not met, that “Mother has
already announced,

30:39.392 --> 30:44.472
through the Vishnumaya also, that you all
have become now Maha Yogis.”

30:44.673 --> 30:52.174
And try to express that, manifest that
with full confidence in yourself

30:52.404 --> 30:56.414
and with this power of love, I am sure
you will all win over.

30:56.615 --> 30:59.593
May God bless you all.

31:12.232 --> 31:14.951
There has been nothing written about
Sahasrara before.

31:15.152 --> 31:17.597
In none of the scriptures Sahasrara is
described.

31:17.798 --> 31:20.215
Nobody knew anything about Sahasrara.

31:20.416 --> 31:23.721
They just left it as the seventh chakra —
finished.

31:23.922 --> 31:29.012
They could only go up to Agnya and nothing
has been written about Sahasrara so far.

31:29.213 --> 31:33.391
And there is no mantras written about
Sahasrara,

31:33.592 --> 31:37.852
so we have to now write Sahasrara mantra.

31:38.053 --> 31:43.636
It is very surprising that even
the photographs of Sahasraras

31:43.836 --> 31:49.036
have appeared now for you to see that
your Sahasraras are opening.

31:49.237 --> 31:56.564
And that is something [that] never happened
before in the whole spiritual history

31:57.594 --> 32:03.081
and nobody could write about it because
they never saw this Sahasrara.

32:03.289 --> 32:09.570
Now, for you, it is important to see that
you have something so unique with you.

32:09.785 --> 32:14.391
But only thing what you need is a courage

32:14.592 --> 32:20.513
and a complete commitment to go forward

32:20.714 --> 32:27.949
with this propagation of Sahaja Yoga,
announcement of Sahaja Yoga.
