00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:14.142
We do not have a complete knowledge about punyas.

00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:19.210
Many people feel that if we give something

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:25.474
to the poor, distribute some things,

00:00:25.554 --> 00:00:34.815
tell the truth or have certain desires then we get punyas.

00:00:34.895 --> 00:00:39.885
Maybe this collection of punyas takes place

00:00:39.965 --> 00:00:46.454
but it is like filling up a lake drop by drop.

00:00:46.534 --> 00:00:52.999
The meaning of punyas that is known is doing the work

00:00:53.079 --> 00:01:01.039
by which God is satisfied and becomes happy.

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:04.301
We should do such works.

00:01:04.381 --> 00:01:10.110
A person who does this kind of work is
really Punyavaan (one who has punyas)

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:18.407
because when he pleases God, then God’s
blessings fall upon him and he gets punyas.

00:01:18.487 --> 00:01:22.255
The powers of God which flow into such a person

00:01:22.335 --> 00:01:30.073
create something like a new consciousness

00:01:30.153 --> 00:01:37.806
or a new personality or a new status in him.

00:01:37.886 --> 00:01:46.473
This new status is such that
when this person goes to any house,

00:01:46.553 --> 00:01:58.413
any country, any place, there the
blessings of God start raining down.

00:01:58.493 --> 00:02:03.338
It is as if he has an umbrella and those
who come under it are blessed by God.

00:02:03.418 --> 00:02:07.829
Wherever such a person lives,
if there is an imminent problem

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.312
in that place then it gets solved.

00:02:13.392 --> 00:02:20.024
If such people move about in cities or forests

00:02:20.104 --> 00:02:24.187
then any accidents that would have taken place don’t do so.

00:02:25.347 --> 00:02:28.366
But punyas have an effect on others.

00:02:28.446 --> 00:02:34.101
For example if you have a lamp, you can polish it,

00:02:34.181 --> 00:02:40.538
make it out of gold or silver or anything else,

00:02:40.618 --> 00:02:49.167
but all that is useless if there is no flame in it.

00:02:49.247 --> 00:02:53.346
Only when the flame is lit, the lamp is useful.

00:02:53.426 --> 00:02:57.535
In the same way, man is useless, whatever he is,

00:02:57.615 --> 00:03:01.280
until the light of the Spirit is present in him.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.474
When the flame is lit in him, he becomes a punyavaan atma

00:03:05.554 --> 00:03:11.078
and the light emanating from him can
enlighten thousands of lamps in the world.

00:03:11.158 --> 00:03:17.160
That’s why, the call for this puja in this
punya nagari today is a very great thing.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.104
When the Shakti is distributed through punyas,

00:03:21.184 --> 00:03:25.313
then punyas get multiplied by
thousands and become extremely powerful.

00:03:25.393 --> 00:03:28.773
Punyas have many powers but
if the Shakti Herself is distributed

00:03:28.853 --> 00:03:31.798
through punyas then what a great thing it is!

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:39.259
Until now people have seen that those
who are full of punyas, are troubled by others,

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:47.812
they don’t have any wealth, they
don’t have any form of protection,

00:03:47.892 --> 00:03:51.510
they are always oppressed by others,

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.095
any person can take them away, any person can fool him.

00:03:57.175 --> 00:04:01.708
But when the Shakti is distributed through punyas,

00:04:01.788 --> 00:04:06.260
then a tremendous energy flows from these punyas

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.179
that none can dare to touch a punyavaan person.

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:14.692
If someone touches then he will know
that there is some tremendous thing.

00:04:14.772 --> 00:04:19.119
In the same way, if a person feels that he can snatch money,

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.893
cheat or trouble such a punyavaan
person then he can’t do so.

00:04:22.973 --> 00:04:29.079
This is a very great blessing of
Kaliyuga that this light can come

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:32.232
and as soon as this light comes
then no one can even touch you

00:04:32.312 --> 00:04:35.617
with the wrong intentions, no one can trouble you,

00:04:35.697 --> 00:04:42.327
no one can kill you, no one can snatch anything from you.

00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:44.703
You are completely protected.

00:04:44.783 --> 00:04:48.804
You will see that you will become so powerful

00:04:48.884 --> 00:04:56.380
that you can end any form of terror
or problems just by standing up to it.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.502
So, the vehicle of today is the
distribution of Shakti in punyas

00:05:00.582 --> 00:05:04.524
and this is what has to be achieved in today’s puja.
