00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.930
Today is the parting day.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:24.519
With all the joy and enjoyment of our personalities,
it has become a beautiful painting in My memory.

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:39.660
But for a mother it is very difficult to understand
that everyday I have to think of leaving some

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.980
of My children somewhere and going to another
place.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:01:01.440
I wish a day should come when all of us should
live together all the time.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.960
(Applause).

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:16.219
In your love for Me you have lived in this
partened conditions and have never complained

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:17.570
about it.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:25.990
Whatever was possible the Indian Sahaj Yogis
tried to organize.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:43.049
But it’s like one brother appreciating another
brother and avoiding all the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.920
subjects which might hurt each other, which
might upset another person.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:02:00.649
It is that beautiful love and affection among
yourselves that has brought forth the success

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.280
of this Ganapatipule station.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.650
I know there have been lots of, lots of, lots
of inconveniences to both the parties.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:19.580
But the bliss of love covers everything.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.540
So nice to enjoy each other, each other’s
company.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:36.630
Whatever may be the circumstances, the discomfort,
one doesn’t feel hurt, one doesn’t feel

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.900
in any way insulted or neglected.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.760
It’s such a beauty spread all over.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.150
Such beautiful waves of compassion and love
among yourselves.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:03:03.440
It is nothing more I want, but to see all
of you so nicely enjoying each other’s company,

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.430
loving each other, being kind to each other.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:26.550
We have now started in a way that little world
where peace, love and joy reside together.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:35.300
Please remember that we have to go much further
with it.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:50.910
We have to build up many more Ganapatipule’s
in the world and we have to work for it, in

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.730
unison, in complete concord with the Divine
forces.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:11.330
I have no doubts that My dreams are already
visible and they will be completely fulfilled

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.790
by My worldly children.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.849
[Jaikaras from Sahaja Yogis.

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:21.849
]

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:35.509
In the days where we were having presentations
and this and that, I felt that some people

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:40.710
were left out and I felt sad that some people
are left out.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.560
It’s all by mistake or by some sort of a
omission.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.840
And one should not feel in any way bad.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.210
Nobody has been deliberately left out.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:05:00.060
Everybody is there, whether they may not be
remembered at that time of presentation.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.669
May be they are too close to remember.

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:09.139
One of them I felt was Suraokar, as yesterday
I felt very bad that Suraokar has not been

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:10.139
called.

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:16.570
He has done so much great work for Sahaja
Yoga that I am sorry that I couldn’t get

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.150
his name on the list somehow.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:28.889
And I wish there are many others who are like
this, who will understand that I feel very

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:32.289
much for all of you and I would like to do
anything for you.

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:37.830
But sometimes by omissions if something is
left out, you should not feel hurt because

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:45.819
I do not want to hurt you at all, by any way
or by any say.

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:55.620
I am a Mother and a Guru as you say and it
is a very difficult task.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.770
I can go only upto a point, after that I break
down.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.650
But we have achieved so much.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:16.810
So, one has to say that, that even a Guru
is not so very strict, and so very strong.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:22.069
Things can be managed very well and I should
request all of you, when you are dealing with

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:23.189
other people.

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:26.400
Pradhan is an example of that, I must say.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.509
When you are dealing with other people be
very kind and nice.

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:35.830
Not to be afraid that if you are nice and
kind they might take advantage of you.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:41.199
I like the way Pradhan always sides with all
the other Sahaja Yogis, with all the other

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:49.039
people, everyone and he will always try to
save them and to recommend them and ask Me

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:52.940
that I should forgive them and that they are
very nice people.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:59.499
I know they are nice.

00:06:59.499 --> 00:07:01.419
(applause).

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:05.979
We have most of our leaders are like that.

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:08.039
That’s the thing I like.

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:15.120
I take a test sometimes and I want, when they
tell me that, “Mother no this may be alright,

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.389
he might be good and we will work it out”.

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:20.169
I said, “No, no, no, no, he is no good.

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:22.500
I don’t think I will have him there”.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.860
But then they again come back and say, “no
Mother, let us try, may be, see he might be,

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:32.919
he might be, alright If he obeys he will work
it out”.

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:46.750
I like all these things to be said about your
own brothers and sisters of love and of understanding.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.619
This is how the world has to be.

00:07:50.619 --> 00:07:56.430
And a day will come, it will be, I am sure
in My life time.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.120
(applause)

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:09.139
It has been proved now beyond doubt that Indian
music has come from “Omkara”, from “Chaitanya”.

00:08:09.139 --> 00:08:11.889
You have never studied about Indian music.

00:08:11.889 --> 00:08:15.189
You have no idea about ragas or talas or anything.

00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:21.430
But the way you enjoy shows that when you
reach your spiritual heights, you become one

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:27.839
with the music and the enjoyment of the spirit
is felt within yourselves.

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:34.380
Never before western people enjoyed music
in this manner as you have enjoyed.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:42.430
And that is the reason I am thankful to all
the musicians who are sitting here, that they

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:48.130
have kept up the tradition of Indian music,
which I always felt will unite the whole world

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:52.199
one day, if we keep to the pure knowledge
of Indian music.

00:08:52.199 --> 00:08:58.130
I am very proud of all of them and whatever
is possible I would like to do for them.

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:08.750
Whatever is so glorious and this music has
been preserved by them with odds, I mean with

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:13.650
so many difficulties of every day-to-day life.

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:19.620
And it is very remarkable how, despite the
fact that they are earning, they are working,

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:25.840
they are doing all kinds of things, still
they have maintained this difficult art and

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:34.459
have given such heights to it and the way
they have rendered it, is really extremely

00:09:34.459 --> 00:09:39.690
remarkable in these modern times.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:47.910
Also one has to understand that there is no
end to thanking, I don’t know how to thank

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:52.949
all the people who worked it out, put up everything
and they did everything.

00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:59.990
But as a mother I think you are not supposed
to thank anyone.

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:08.970
Only sadness, which is something like an ocean
sometimes, covers Me up.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:17.800
I cannot express it in words but a kind of
a sadness that makes Me feel that, “Now

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:23.760
for next year when am I going to meet all
of them again.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:28.110
” I am sure next year again you will be
able to come down here.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:34.000
Also, I will be coming to your various countries,
I hope all our plans will work out.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.920
As far as travelling is concerned I try My
level best to do as much as possible.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:47.329
But still it’s your co-operation, it’s
your understanding of this very, very subtle

00:10:47.329 --> 00:10:56.220
state, of this very subtle personality, is
so important.

00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:01.069
I can only say I bless you all from My heart.

00:11:01.069 --> 00:11:13.260
I bless all the artists, everyone here for
understanding this great work that I have

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:22.940
taken over, for helping Me out and out to
carry out this extremely subtle work for human

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.740
mind.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:33.360
May God bless you.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.440
I am sorry, I can’t go on, but I was to
feel about the weddings.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:41.120
I am very happy about the weddings, that you
know what I am feeling it within Myself.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.170
So just try to feel Me.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:44.910
I cannot put everything into words.

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:50.540
I was enamored the way marriages took place,
the way they were looking so beautiful, just

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.779
like Vaikuntha coming down on this earth.

00:11:52.779 --> 00:11:54.870
No doubt about it.

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:59.899
The whole thing is so beautiful that you cannot
describe it in one word, or two words or in

00:11:59.899 --> 00:12:01.829
many lectures also.

00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:08.769
Only thing is that we hope that we have it
again more and more, and we create very good

00:12:08.769 --> 00:12:10.440
family lives in this world.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.800
May God bless you.
