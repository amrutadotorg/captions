00:00:00.992 --> 00:00:04.079
Today, we are here to celebrate the birthday of Shri Jesus Christ.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.190
Jesus Christ's life was very short and He spent most of His time in India, in Kashmir.

00:00:08.391 --> 00:00:11.907
He went back just for last three years

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.720
and people fixed Him to a cross.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.560
It was somewhat destined.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.400
To open Agnya chakra

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.560
He had to offer this sacrifice.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.880
So in this way He

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.000
set up Agnya chakra.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.960
Agnya chakra is very

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.400
constricted

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.360
small

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.200
and not easily openable,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.560
because a human being

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.400
got freedom

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.920
that made him egoistic.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.680
This ego

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.880
constricted his Agnya chakra.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.199
And from that

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.253
constricted Agnya chakra

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.182
it was necessary to take out ego.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.400
And to take out ego

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.960
you have to control your (MAAN).

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.360
But you do not take out your ego from your (MAAN).

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.400
As soon as you will try to take out your ego from your (MAAN)

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.160
the (MAAN) will go on increasing

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.600
and the ego will go on increasing

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.600
[ AHAAM  KAROTI  SAHA  AHAMKAR ]

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.800
We do !

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.840
It means that if we try to minimise our ego

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.120
the ego will shoot up because

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.960
we will try to do so with the help of ego only.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.360
Those who think

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.400
that to our ego

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.480
will suppress

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.160
will eat less food

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.640
worldwide violence

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.440
one

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.360
standing on one foot and some on their head.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.680
Every type of

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.080
experiment

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.600
people do to destroy their ego

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.640
But it does not supress the ego.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.560
It shoots up.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.720
To fast, to do (JAP TAP)

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.840
everything

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.880
shoots up ego !

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.160
[Havana] also gives rise to ego !

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.240
Because Agni is right sided.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.440
Whatever

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.160
karmakand we do, rituals  we perform gives rise to our ego.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.000
For the past thousands of years human beings

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.640
have been doing the same type of karmakand.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.080
Everything inside out whatever has been taught, is he doing.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.840
This is why Sahajyoga is against karmakand.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.080
There is no need to do any karmakand.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.120
And to go to the extremes is all the more bad.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.040
As I said

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.640
that to take away your ego

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.760
you, in Marathi is called (JODE PATTI ) beat 'it' with shoes.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.920
So daily in the morning Sahajyogis

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.280
move out in a line with shoes in their hands.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.560
O.k ! but if you have ego, then only

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.280
Every one is going out with a shoe in his hand.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.760
All this

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.800
karmakand  penetrated into Sahajyoga too.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.680
So much so, that from France a gentleman came

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.040
from Vashi hospital and got this karmakand from there.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.400
It is for sick people.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.000
If you have this trouble, then you do this karmakand

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.760
The karmakand of cancer are written in that.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.160
I said it is human being's nature

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.200
to do karmakand because he thinks that he can do it

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.035
because of my karmakand, work will be done

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.479
and in this karmakand

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.333
not only you

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.527
in foreign country also

00:05:15.671 --> 00:05:18.671
many people go on doing karmakand of various types.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.560
For example

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.840
will go to church once a year.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.960
Means today.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.760
After that they don't take even the name of God.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.200
After doing all the dirty jobs of world

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.840
and go to Catholic  ( DHARAM) and make confession

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.120
If you can see this foolishness, then will be a Sahajyogi.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.320
If you can understand that this wrong act

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.000
What we have done is wrong

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.800
and now onwards this act is not to be done.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.520
If you can understand this

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.000
your brain will retain it

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.640
Now,

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.800
Karmakandis have got all the more qualities.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.160
One thing is that they are misers number one.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.800
If you talk to them about ten rupees

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.560
they start jumping into the sky.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.320
That is called in Marathi, 'KODI CHUMBAK'

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.640
One thing is that in Marathi there are such words

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.040
That your ego will dissolve easily.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.720
For example somebody

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.560
talked high of himself, i did this, i did that

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.960
tell him in a low voice

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.599
'You are climbing a chickpea tree'.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.700
A chickpea tree doesn't exist !

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.600
[Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi]

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.840
So he cools down.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.560
I did this, i did that, i

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.600
Till this 'I' ness doesn't go

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.560
till then our recognising Christ is wrong.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.480
But it is surprising

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.280
that what is called ' Christian Nations' where there is christanity

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.200
more than them egoistic I have not seen

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.600
particularly English.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:21.960
American

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.400
everybody

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.080
is so much egoistic

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.760
that can't understand these desciples of Christ.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.711
Now what is the remedy of this ego?

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.664
that should be thought

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.319
It's remedy was Jesus Christ

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.560
and He has taught

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.240
that now

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.800
love everybody

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.080
love your enemies too.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.520
It's remedy He said was 'Love'.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.840
and apart from 'Love'

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.520
there is no remedy.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.960
But this 'Love'

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.280
is the 'Love' of Param Chaitanya.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.360
He said clearly,'Seek yourself'.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.480
knock the door and the door will open !

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.240
It doesn't mean that you go and knock the door.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.200
It means open the doors of your heart.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.400
A peson whose heart is small

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.840
those who are misers

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.240
that person can never be a Sahajyogi.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.480
And another thing which is very important

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.920
if you get angry

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.840
it means that you have too much ego.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.640
I have seen absolutely angry volatile people

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:15.120
And they feel elated saying,'I am a very angry person'.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.200
Such people cannot be in Sahajyoga.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:26.280
Those who know to 'Love' and that too 'Pure Love'

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.240
and that too such 'Love' where there is no expectation

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.960
no desire

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.200
those who completely know to love selflessly

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.880
only they can be in Sahajyoga.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.480
Egoistic people do wrong acts.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.600
I am tired of them.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.876
They will start something on their own

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.480
and they won't even tell me.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.280
and by doing so

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.840
Today thousands of questions have risen

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.320
Today it is worth saying that in Delhi

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.400
once they

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.200
on the day of some puja hurriedly told me

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.119
that we are getting land only this much.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.880
How much did we charge ?

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:25.400
How is that going to be ? How is the land ? Nothing !

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.720
And no Sahajyogi told me.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.200
Because if tomorrow somebody says, 'Mataji has said so'

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.800
leave that person.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.040
If I have to say something, I will tell myself.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.160
After that we had so many meetings, I didn't say anything.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.720
Now those who have given them money

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.360
are holding their heads

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.880
that they have been cheated !

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.920
How to get back that money ?

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.640
Without asking Me all the work

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.720
Absolutely without asking Me.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.560
The land is so bad that they have received a notice

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.000
that you cannot construct anything here. On the contrary you will be arrested

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.560
Every Sahajyogi has right to tell Me

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:21.920
and ask Me

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.760
they made a society of their own

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.200
and became mad

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.720
that they are getting land

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.080
It is such a bad land

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.480
It is said that you cannot grow even a chicken

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.080
Are the Sahajyogis even worst than chickens ?

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.440
Now whatever has happened is foolishness !

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.480
and for that I am not responsible.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.680
But you ask for your money back.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.480
It is none of My resposibility.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.400
Jesus Christ had said that

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.760
those people

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.000
make houses

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.240
live in houses

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.800
they should watch birds

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.760
he makes his own (GHARONDA)

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:30.600
with how much love they make a small one for their ownself

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.440
and when they make their home

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.240
they feel a great joy in constructing that home.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.560
He explained it in every way

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.320
that you give up attatchment.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.200
This is my house.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.600
This is my land.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.040
They are my children.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.989
Even this much that it is my country.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.120
This attatchment should be given up.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.400
Then only you can be great.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.800
In the whole world you are

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.520
brothers and sisters.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:22.080
It doesn't mean that you give up devotion to your country.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.360
Not at all !

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:27.480
If you are not devoted to your country you can't do anything.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.592
Within you there should be devotion to country.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.359
But the same devotee to country becomes devoted to the world.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.600
If there is no devotion to one's country

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.840
if there is no drop, how can there be a sea ?

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:47.840
first of all whether there is devotion to country, is to be seen first of all.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.719
If you are working  against your country

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.760
you are not devoted to it.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.280
Jesus Christ

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.200
had no need to go back.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.440
He had said also

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.120
That there live such people

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.200
Those who have the desire of only (MAL) are (MALECH)

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.920
But Shalivahana told Him, 'No ! No 1 you go'.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.800
' And teach them (NIRMAL TATTWAM) the principle of purity.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.960
He went there to teach 'Nirmal Tatwam' and they put an end to His life.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.080
It is mad people's country.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.120
He didn't need to learn anything.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.680
But had to teach something.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.600
That is why He went there.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.600
and for the same reason

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.680
His end was this way.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.400
But 'Wiseness' and 'Forgiveness'

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.760
'Forgiveness' is the only mantra which can open Agnya chakra.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.040
If against anyone you have

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.360
any ill feeling

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.880
against anyone

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.480
anger

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:58.480
or

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:03.520
if there is a tendency to be violent against anyone

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.720
your Agnya cannot be up to the mark.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.400
Whatever you have to do

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.120
you have to do with love.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.360
Even if you have to say something to anyone you have to say

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.040
so that his life becomes 'NIRMAL'.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.760
It doesn't mean that you spoil your children.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.960
To children

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.400
you have to perfectly

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.320
discipline

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.000
If you cannot discipline children

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.920
your children can never be good Sahajyogis.

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.440
And for that you must be yourself disciplined.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:51.120
If you are not disciplined yourself you cannot discipline your children.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:56.800
About Jesus Christ's life very little was written.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.120
But He was so disciplined

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.560
In this way

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:04.880
tolerated

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.440
and from His life He showed

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.800
He didn't need to be married

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.760
He didn't marry

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.120
It doesn't mean that He was against marriage.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:22.440
People have such wrong notions

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.120
And that is why

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.480
they have self made notions

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.200
the women who are called 'NUNS' were married to Jesus Christ

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.680
He was Sakhshat Ganesha !

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.200
How can anyone be married to Him ?

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.080
Apart from that

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.520
Men also no to marry

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.200
such unnatural/ uncultural  concepts were taught.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:53.160
With that everyone can be kept under control

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.400
but one cannot become Christian.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.440
like such

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.040
[KRITRIM BANDHAN]

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.840
to cover oneself

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.800
today Chritian religion is losing its importance.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.760
They forgot Jesus !

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.920
and created a religion out of their own

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.320
and call it Christian religion.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.720
The Christian religion of today

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.440
Looks like a blot on the name of Jesus !

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.720
Because I was born in this religion

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.720
I saw the ins and outs of this religion.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.480
The same is the case with Hindu religion.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.600
In Hindu religion you cannot be communal at all.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:59.400
Because your various gurus, real gurus

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.920
like Datatreya etc., and Nathpanthies

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:08.360
are your many incarnations

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.680
and your Sayambus are many.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.800
You don't have one book. You have number of books.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.840
Only Jesus and Bible

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:25.280
They can be fundamentalists.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.960
And they can be Yahudis also

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.920
And all the three are related to each other.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.240
It is written in books.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.720
But a Hindu can never be communal.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.200
Because some have some guru and others a different guru.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.040
Some adore Mahalaxmi.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.800
Others  Renuka Devi.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.520
Some to Krishna.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.800
So, every person

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:04.760
every family individually

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.160
adore incarnation, books.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.800
As such there is no book

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.080
which can be called as Holy Bible.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.800
So to all the religions

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:27.760
a Hindu should pay respect.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.640
I have noticed

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:33.400
The capacity of paying respect is maximum in Hindus.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.840
Once we were in a hotel, there was a Bible.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:43.680
They keep a Bible (IN THE ROOM) whether somebody reads or not.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.840
That Bible fell on the floor.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:50.000
There was one Hindu with us.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:55.960
He picked up The Bible, put It on his head and then on the table.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.520
They will never touch The Bible with their feet.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.200
The Christians will do so.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.200
A Hindu will never do so.

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.800
To respect everybody is Hindu's Dharma.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:17.360
But those who have come out of it are very very strange.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.680
Those who are our politicians

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.960
such people have taken birth.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.120
As mushrooms come out in monsoon

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.000
same way some people have come out.

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.480
But they are not Hindus.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.880
They don't know anything about their (DHARMA) religion.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.160
North Indians don't know it at all.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:42.960
And those

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.880
who are South Indians

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.480
they know that bramhins have to be given money

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.480
here and there, have to do this and that (RITUALS).

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:55.080
In this Maharashtra there is nothing else than karmakand.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.120
They are so karmakandi.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.160
In Maharashtra I have worked very hard.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.880
Everything was waste.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.640
Because they are very ritualistic  (KARMAKANDI).

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.320
They cannot give it up.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.800
Here is the temple of Siddhi Vinayak.

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.320
The Ganeshji that is there, I have awakened that.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.240
Now what do I see that there one mile long

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.960
long lines one mile long

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.960
are standing on Tuesday.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.000
Gneshji too must have slept.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.360
The ritualistic people of this type are in Maharashtra.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:38.600
Because of that Karmakand their temprament has become hot.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.920
And in North India also

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.120
I have seen

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.560
that some people are Karmakandi.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.720
And those who are Karmakandi

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.720
they have lot of anger, are hot tempered.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:00.240
And those who are not in Karmakand are very cool.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:05.120
So the first thing is Stop ritualism

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.400
but respect everything.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.960
Stopping ritualism doesn't mean to kick everything.

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:17.520
This balancing was taught by Jesus Christ.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.840
Without this balance your Agnya Chakra cannot open.

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:28.640
Everbody's respect

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:36.400
and unnecessary

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:41.160
ritualism, in which wrong people are growing.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:48.360
Now a day's false gurus

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.280
They exist because of ritualism (KARMAKAND).

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:57.280
They will say you give so much money, do this do that.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.840
Do Havana

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:05.760
108 times daily read these names, those names

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.680
giving you mantras, doing this that.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:13.040
These are Karmakandis and teach you Karmakand.

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:16.800
Completely against which is Jesus Christ.

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:29.680
Which He knew that by doing Karmakand

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.320
a human being becomes egoistic.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.800
and to crack this ego,

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.080
To Karmakand, He

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.680
had totally forbidden.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:56.280
The same way, in the name of God

00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:00.400
anyone earning money was objectionable to Him.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.160
On the contrary reverse process started.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.400
Earn money and consume.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.280
They don't give up earning

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.800
but (believe to) earn money and consume.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.640
It doesn't solve any problem.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.600
Today in Sahajyoga work

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.320
We should remember

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:28.400
how much money we paid for Sahajyoga work.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.760
How much money did we give?

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.960
Jesus Christ had twelve  fish killers.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:39.240
Even they

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.240
spread in the  whole world by working hard.

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.440
Today you are so many disciples of mine.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.080
And if you want

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.040
you can give realisation to so many people.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.160
Can introduce so many people to Sahajyoga.

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.960
But the people should not be half baked.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.520
They should be deep.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:08.160
Unless they are deep, they cannot understand.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:12.120
And for that the greatest thing is

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.320
that how much we love them.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.200
And how much love they give to others.

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.240
Anyone who is a leader in Sahajyoga

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:24.320
he should remember first of all

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:29.200
that the teaching of Jesus Christ is to love everybody.

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.800
Am i doing that ?

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.120
I shower my anger over everyone.

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.920
I keep everybody under control

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.000
I express my anger with my eyes.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.400
This ego is

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:47.920
very much

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.200
not only against  Sahajyoga

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.320
but his destructor

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.600
Whosoever is egoistic

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.560
should lessen it and replace it with love

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.520
Life will be  a pleasure.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.040
Life will be beautiful !

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.040
If you don't know how to love

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.640
then for a few days you come out of Sahajyoga.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.480
First you open the doors of your heart.

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:23.540
With that only With its Shakti only Sahajyoga will spread.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.199
The question is that those who spread Sahajyoga

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.960
they have the Shakti of love less and the Shakti of anger more.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.397
It will never spread.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:38.720
With love it will spread And with anger it will minimise and diminish.

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:45.720
The teaching of Jesus is necessary for us to understand.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.880
Sorry ! I had to talk in Hindi language

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.960
because most of the people are here Indians

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.360
Some of them are Marathis

00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:00.080
and others are from North India.

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:04.040
I was telling them about Christ.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.240
What was His power ?

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.920
His power was of 'Love'.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.240
And not of anger

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.800
Because He is the one

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.360
who has crossed

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:28.120
the most difficult center of Agnya.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.280
Those people who have ego

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.520
never realise they have ego

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.320
With their ego they do

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.960
all kinds of nonsensical things.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.840
Without asking Me

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.520
they have done something in Delhi.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.200
Without asking me

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.320
they have done something in Russia.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.240
And it is so destructive to Sahajyoga.

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.840
that they don't realise

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.800
what they have done is the crime

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.400
which is punishable by all Divine laws.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:08.400
If you want to do anything you must

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.400
tell me beforehand.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.880
You must consult Me

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.560
you must talk to Me

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.840
Because I know what is happening.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.960
You don't know if somebody wants to cheat you.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:27.200
Then how will you know if you were

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.360
so sensitive you would find out

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.760
You would have asked Me,

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.960
'Mother what should we do ?'

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.240
At least ask Me.

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:44.560
This is the main thing missing among

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.840
Sahajyogis now that

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:50.240
we have a kind of a very subtle ego.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.800
If you make somebody a leader

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.080
it is very dangerous sometimes.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.920
If the leader developes ego because of his wife,

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.080
It is a very difficult thing.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.320
They can destroy Sahajyoga completely.

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.480
Anything is possible.

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.320
So before you do anything like that

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.000
you have to consult (Me).

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:15.680
I am still living

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.360
and you can ask.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:21.080
You can write to Me, you can telephone too.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.240
At least I am there to tell you.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:28.560
But then you have to develop

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.720
your balance and your love.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:34.600
That is only through this Param Chaitanya

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:38.200
It is all pervading power of Divine Love.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:41.680
You can develop that discretion.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:43.280
special

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.480
.....powers.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Even if somebody telephones to Me

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.080
immediately I know what is wrong with that person.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.680
I don't say that you can become like Me.

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:59.160
But at least you have vibrations to see.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.000
Also see your own vibrations.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.320
How are you moving ?

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:06.520
Put a paper on your hand

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:10.360
and you will see it will start shaking before My photograph.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.440
With this ego

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.040
you cannot go further

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.200
Why did you come to sahajyoga ?

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:21.120
You came here not to become

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.400
some sort of a leader

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.280
or some sort of a

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.120
a king but

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.040
you came here

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.480
to become a great guru.

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.320
As you ask Me Gurupad Dijiye.

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.840
For that you have to have in Sahajyoga

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.800
a complete humility

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.400
natural humility

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.760
natural balance.

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:55.520
This is what Christ has taught us.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:09.960
At that time

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.200
I don't think that people had that much ego.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.120
Ego is a modern present to you.

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.520
People get ego out of anything.

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:30.320
For example, I met one lady once and found her ego very bad.

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:33.280
I said, ''What is the matter with her?''

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:35.960
So, I asked My daughters ,''What does she do?''

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:40.000
They said," Mummy She knows how to make dolls.''

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:42.040
For that she had ego.

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.200
What is so great

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.560
than to be a good sahajyogi

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:50.320
You may be the king, you may be anything.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.240
Now you see the Prime Ministers

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.280
and all of them going to jail.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:57.920
What are they compared to you?

00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.240
They have no balance.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.160
They have no sense.

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.320
What makes you a separate

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.760
individuals

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:11.320
higher people, because

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:15.360
you have no ego.

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:21.160
Now people try to remove their ego

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.720
Their two types.....

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.600
So they will go on beating themselves with shoes.

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:34.440
All kinds of ritualistic things they do to remove their ego.

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.840
But all this we do with our mind.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.080
Whatever you do with your mind will give you ego only.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.600
They become ascetic.

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.160
They are the greatest egoist.

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:52.440
I must say, Hitler was the greatest ascetic.

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.640
With his asceticism he became Hitler.

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.920
If you want to become Hitler, you become ascetic.

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.280
In Sahajyoga you are not allowed at all

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:03.840
all this asceticism.

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.680
You have to be loving

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:14.400
affectionate

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.960
kind and disciplined.

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:21.920
I must say this because when you are loving

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:25.320
you go out of bounds sometimes

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.199
because you have no discipline of sahajyoga.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:34.240
Loving doesn't mean that you become like a

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.440
Romeo, Juliet,doesn't mean that.

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:43.320
You must have your balance through your discipline.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.160
If you have no discipline

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:49.600
you can never be a good Sahajyogi.

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.040
From the life of Christ

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:56.880
we have to learn

00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:58.760
these things

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:02.240
that unless and until we have these things

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.520
we cannot

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.800
become good Sahajyogis.

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:11.960
Firstly, ritualistic nature

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:16.160
secondly, anger

00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:19.280
thirdly, miserliness.

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.280
like

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:24.920
if you

00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:27.400
go to England

00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:28.800
it is written there

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:31.360
'save pounds by taking a taxi'

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.160
this is what it is.

00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:38.800
Miserliness

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.160
where can we save money,

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:44.879
'Mother, can you give concession?'

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:48.880
it is not a some sort of a business I am doing here.

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:55.000
'If you make it half price, so many will come'.

00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.960
''I am not using your money''.

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:04.367
I am using it for your buildings, all this I have got it

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.760
of course My money also and your money.

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.320
So many things I have done

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.520
The whole of Vashi

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.920
the whole of Ashram

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.320
In Delhi two ashrams,

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.320
then the whole of school

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.200
and also

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:25.000
land in Pune and other places.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.640
Now in Pune they want Me

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.240
to pay the land, to pay for everything

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.080
and Pune people are the known Maharashtrians

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.320
to be great

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.960
miserly, kanjoos people.

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.800
Even for their own

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:46.000
ashram, they would like Me to pay for everything.

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:49.360
and they nicely go and sing bhajans nicely.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:52.800
See they are good musicians, that is what they are.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.400
Very very miserly people.

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.000
Miserly people can never love.

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.200
Tthey love money.

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.960
Egoistical people can never love

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.920
because they love power

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:11.440
to control others.

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:17.440
They think theey are doing for Sahajyoga.

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.120
but not.

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:22.840
Unless until you do something for yourself and ego

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:25.280
no use working for Sahajyoga.

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.120
Look at The Christ

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:33.000
He took birth in a very humble

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:34.720
abode.

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.840
But He was the king.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.400
And He lived with the poor

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.600
and tried to save them.

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:47.920
He saved the lepers.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:50.120
He saved so many people, there were.

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:54.320
Twenty one people were cured by Him.

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:57.920
Now sahaj yoga I don't know, how many thousands have been cured.

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.600
But what is important is if you are curing

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.200
you know that you are not curing

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:10.120
It is the Divine power that is curing.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.000
You are not doing anything

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.320
It is best to be like that.

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:19.760
I feel the same way that I am doing nothing

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.520
and I am Nishkriya

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.240
doing nothing.

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:25.920
but I am not lazy.

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:32.600
You should be active but all your activity

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:36.160
should come from the Divine power of 'Love'

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:40.080
First of all you must extend your hands for l'ove'.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.160
You extend your heart

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.320
extend your money

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.560
house, everything for 'Love'

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.520
Now once your wife doesn't allow others to come in

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:54.000
throw her out of the house, I don't mind.

00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:00.560
Teach her how to be kind and generous

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:02.832
otherway round for the husband.

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.227
It is very important

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:10.480
you have to be generous. You have to be kind, you have to be loving

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.628
and sweet to others.

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.040
Christ only once went into temper

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:18.000
which He had a right to do that

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.440
when He saw people

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.640
selling things in the temple.

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.440
Samething we have here.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.960
And if you don't go and buy anything from them they will be lost.

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:34.399
But you only go and buy things from them because

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.479
you have a habit of shopping.

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:39.520
Anywhere they people go, they must shop

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.360
is a habit

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.080
shopping they must do.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:45.960
They will not see the greenery

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.920
the beauty of nature, nothing.

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:52.760
When I went to so many countries,you see I had to

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:54.960
with my husband

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.800
I had to go

00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.960
and see beautiful places like museums.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:02.680
I never used to shop.

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:07.439
But when I have so many children then I have to shop.

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.346
So I would go for shops.

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.560
But not the way that

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.640
that every place is for shopping.

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:15.960
What is there to shop here

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:19.480
when you have come here for your spiritual growth.

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:23.440
In Mecca, do they have any shops?

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.240
This is the holier than holi.

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:33.160
Why should go to the shops ? I can't understand.

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:36.040
I have told them not to have shops

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:39.560
but you people are the ones, who encourage.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.680
who encouraged them to make money out of us ?

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:48.320
Nothing essential to buy there.

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:53.480
Now you have come to the holy occassion.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:57.360
Here you have come for your worship.

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:02.440
In our Mahalaxmi temple

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.880
there are people who are selling

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:07.680
garlands and things for ladies' hair.

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:10.560
But they say it is for the Goddess.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.120
And they buy there.

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:15.000
All the people who are coming stupidly

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:18.000
and give it

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.400
to the brahmin in the temple

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.840
and the Brahmin sells it back

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:24.760
at a lower price.

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.960
And these garlands are

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:30.720
I don't know how many times sold and bought

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.920
and sold and bought because of the

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.320
stupidity of the people who go there.

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:37.880
If they have to take something

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.867
they should buy it from outside,

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:42.840
not at the place where you have come.

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:52.360
As it is you went to Delhi, you could have bought it there.

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:55.480
or you came to Bombay

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:58.360
you could have bought there but not in this place.

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:02.040
We cannot make this place Bombay or Delhi

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.440
otherwise why should we come here.

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.600
That is why christ took a hunter

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:14.000
and beat them those who were selling things near the church.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:17.880
Now they don't have

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.160
I have seen, near the church they don't have.

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:22.720
They have outside.

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.920
But they sell other things

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:30.440
like catholic church sells

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.560
a wine called Benedictine.

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:34.760
Imagine !

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:37.400
That is another story.

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:40.320
Christ went

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.200
for wedding

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.520
and they had no wine.

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:51.640
Now in the Hibru language

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.040
wine

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:54.760
means

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.600
the juice of the grapes.

00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.320
It doesn't mean fermented.

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:04.400
So He converted water into black wine.

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:07.160
You cannot convert

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.960
water instatantaneously

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:12.920
into wine.

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:15.520
Wine has to rot , has to smell

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:18.080
The more it smells, the best it is.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:23.960
But they think that Christ said you must drink this thing.

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:27.720
He never said that.

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:32.960
He just converted it into wine.

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:34.160
meaning

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:35.400
the

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:39.520
taste of the juice of grapes.

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.320
Once I went

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:43.520
to some television

00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:47.200
and there was a very nice man in Italy.

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:51.400
He said ,''Mother you first give me realisation''.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.600
So I said ,''Get some Water''. I put My hand into it.

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:56.080
" Now you drink it".

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:59.320
He said ,"It is tasting like wine".

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:01.840
I said,"This is what Christ did".

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.320
He got his realisation.

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.560
Instantaneously, you cannot make wine.

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:12.320
But if somebody dies, they will drink.

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:15.360
If somebody is born, they will drink.

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:19.240
At any cost, without drinking they are not normal.

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:28.239
But the people who got realisation are suddenly changed.

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.920
They don't want to drink. They have stopped drinking.

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.919
Their attention has become nice.

00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:34.800
The whole thing is changed.

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.560
This is the transformation that has worked

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:41.520
of which Christ has talked, Mohammed sahib has talked

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.800
everybody has talked about this particular time

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.600
when people will get transformed.

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:50.200
But even after transformation

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.880
you do not want to become what you have to be

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.806
for which you have come here.

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:00.640
You will be left behind.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:02.447
It is a big

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:13.463
transformation is taking place.

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:18.256
In that transformation also your rising is taking place.

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:21.600
There is a big evolution going on

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.840
and those who will not evolve properly

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.360
will be left behind.

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:33.840
As it is said that, it is the last judgement.

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.331
And you will be judged.

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:39.320
You will be left behind.

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:43.320
You cannot adhere to people who are rising higher.

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:46.240
With your weight you will fall down.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:49.960
So for you

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:52.920
to understand Christ

00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:56.000
is all these qualities you must have.

00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:00.920
If you are hot tempered , alright , go and beat yourself with shoes.

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:04.160
But if you are not, then you need not.

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:06.800
You must know what you are.

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:08.360
First of all introspect.

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:10.760
Accordingly you should work it out.

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:14.720
But this ritualism is not allwed in Sahajyoga all the time.

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:34.920
I would love all my children.

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:39.640
To be extremely loving and collective.

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:45.560
Not to denounce anybody for no rhyme and reason

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:48.360
and if you have to denounce, you should tell Me.

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:50.520
I know what is what !

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:54.560
Without asking Me, you should not measure up somebody

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.320
and say i have measured somebody.

00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:58.663
With what ? what is your yardstick ?

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:05.080
You yourself you are caught up in the web of ego.

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:10.520
You cannot condemn anyone without telling Me.

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.679
You have to tell me.

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:15.800
Don't worry that this thing will disturb Me or anything

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.559
but you should ask.

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:19.439
I know about everyone.

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:23.240
May be I have not mat that person but i can feel the vibrations.

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:27.240
You can write to me.

00:46:27.824 --> 00:46:30.639
Many people just telephone, that is not the way.

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:34.560
You must write to Me because I read each and every letter.

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:39.439
But all nonsensical letters you should not write also to waste my time.

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:44.720
.....like my father's mother's, mother, this thing

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:49.960
is sick or is dead and her bhoot is moving about.

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:56.240
All sorts of funny letters come to Me.

00:46:56.441 --> 00:46:59.520
What can I do for such people ? That is not important.

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:02.400
All: "I need money, I have no money.

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:07.600
I am depending on you for money. So please send me money."

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:12.280
You can ask on my photograph.

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:18.040
If you are a good Sahajyogi, you don't have to worry for money also.

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:25.200
Or i have no child ,Mother what to do? Mother i want to have a child.

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:28.629
Those who have child, ask them what do else they have to say.

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:34.040
So many have got children after coming to Sahajyoga

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:36.080
but you must deserve it.

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:44.880
So many miracles have taken place.

00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:48.480
So many people have been cured no doubt.

00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:52.000
But that doesn't mean that you have done it.

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:57.760
Don't get into the trap of ego.

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.680
That is most dangerous.

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:07.440
If you destroy sahajyoga, you are destroying yourself.

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:16.240
So, today you all have to promise in your heart.

00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:19.320
Put your hands to your heart

00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:20.640
and to say

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:23.920
''Mother, We love,

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:27.760
We spread your Divine Love,

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.520
encompass the whole world,

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:33.280
give realisation to all the people.

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.120
Will not shout,

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:37.640
will not be angry,

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:43.880
will not do the all kinds of rituals but just surrender.

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:46.400
Surrender our ego

00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:48.040
surrender ego

00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:49.960
surrender your ego.

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:52.360
All your problems can be solved.

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:54.680
because, as long as, there is ego

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.280
this divine power doesn't take over.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.120
You may do anything

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:02.200
You are not connected. Your connection is missing.

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:05.760
Christ is missing. He is no more.

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:13.040
To establish Him first of all you must show how you love.

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:15.880
That doesn't mean that you love your wife,

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.360
love your children and love your house.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.120
You have to love everyone.

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:26.280
Try to make everyone happy.

00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:28.880
That is why I like music

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.120
because through music you can spread vibrations.

00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:36.280
Very good media of spreading vibrations

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:39.039
of loving vibrations.

00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:43.320
But those who are musicians have to be loving people,

00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:46.637
not hot tempered

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:49.645
not showing off

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:54.160
not thinking too much of themselves.

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.000
All these will work

00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:59.800
very well if you understand

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000
that this Divine power

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:05.120
is so powerful.

00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:08.200
No doubt it is love,

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.400
no doubt it is truth,

00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:14.000
and no doubt

00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:19.600
if you get out of it, you will be caught up by anything

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.800
and you could be finished.

00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:26.400
It is a very very

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:32.680
powerful, effective and absolutely conclusive

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:36.160
power you have within yourself.

00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:40.080
And thanks to christ that crucified Himself

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:42.840
sacrificed his body for our sake

00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:44.600
that our agnya is opened up.

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.200
Otherwise I could not have done this Sahajyoga.

00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:51.160
But in this area

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:54.600
we have Buddha, Christ and Mahavira.

00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:59.640
and they had to do tapasya, tapaha.

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:01.040
They did it.

00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:04.800
You don't have to do now, they have done for you.

00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:12.000
Now see I saw the musicians yesterday.

00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:14.599
In two three months they have learnt so much,

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:17.800
otherwise formerly  all the musicians I knew.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.360
For Indian music

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:21.960
had to really starve.

00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:24.800
For months together they had to practice

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.720
years together, they had to bow to their guru.

00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:30.880
That is all over now.

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.480
because of this Param Chaitanya

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:37.480
and your power

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:41.080
to be one with the Divine.

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:44.880
This Divine power can transform you completely

00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:46.760
to such an extent

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:48.840
that anything that you want to do,

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:50.800
you can do it in two, three months.

00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:54.920
In Pune when they were singing

00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:58.000
'foreigners' as we call them with respect.

00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:01.440
In India 'foreigners' means respect , not like other countries.

00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:04.040
So they were singing.

00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:07.920
They were some very great musicians (who) had come.

00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:11.880
They told  Me,"Mother, we put down our head to them."

00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:14.120
Because how could these people

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:18.720
who don't know a word about Indian music have learnt it so well

00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:22.200
and the pronunciation of these Marathi languages were difficult.

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:24.320
But they are so good at it

00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:26.160
is very surprising.

00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:31.720
Now all this has happened in your presence,

00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:34.280
in your presence.

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:38.247
It is nice here, you have balloons here.

00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:40.440
to celebrate Christ's birthday.

00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:43.840
and all these balloons of your ego should be burst,

00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:45.560
should be finished.

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:54.000
(clapping)

00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:02.600
I will be happy if you could learn Hindi language.

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:06.480
But I know My English may not be so good

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:09.600
but best is to learn hindi,

00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:12.520
if possible.

00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:17.040
Because there are already fourteen languages in India

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.600
and so many languages in another country.

00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:24.759
Every country has a different type of English language.

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.560
If you go to America,

00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:29.960
I don't understand their English for at least two, three days.

00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:31.600
Because they go on

00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:33.240
taking their

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:35.240
....tongue

00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:39.200
and lips on one side, then on another side.

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:48.360
English of the French is another point.

00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:50.640
So best is to learn Hindi.

00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:55.320
and that too a good Hindi, not Sanskritized.

00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:59.040
But as they say (Rozmara) i.e., day- to- day- Hindi because

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:02.600
I feel better if you understand what I am saying.

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:05.080
It is not difficult because you are all sahajyogis.

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:08.360
You can learn Hindi in no time. I am not saying you learn Sanskrit.

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:09.720
But Hindi is very easy.

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:11.680
Try to. It is not My Mother tongue.

00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:14.360
I have never studied Hindi language, never.

00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:18.320
But you see it is a very easy language to learn.

00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:23.840
But as My father told Me ,"Never teach Hindi language

00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:25.760
to an English man."

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:30.160
I said," Why this advise ?"

00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:33.119
He said," There was an English man who was after me

00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:35.466
that i should teach him Hindi."

00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:40.000
so he said," I have to tell my servant to open the door

00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:43.000
or to close the door.''

00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:47.560
So for open the door he said you say

00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:53.600
'there was a cool day', means 'Darwaza khol de'

00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:00.268
(clapping)

00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:11.360
And for closing the door, you have to say, 'There was a banker'

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:16.680
"Maine darwaza bandh kar dey" (means close the door)

00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:20.720
But now it is different.

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:25.280
They will pick up Hindi very quickly.

00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:28.320
Very quickly, I can see that.

00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:33.440
If you can learn this horrible Indian classical music

00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:37.360
which is so difficult, so easily, what will happen ?

00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:41.960
They can learn Hindi in no time and make Me happier every time.

00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:45.079
Not because Hindi is My language- It is not, it is Marathi.

00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:46.600
Marathi is very difficult.

00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:50.040
I don't think you can learn Marathi. It is very precise.

00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:52.427
I think that is one of the best languages

00:55:52.628 --> 00:55:54.920
to put down your ego.

00:55:56.791 --> 00:55:59.639
That is why Maharashtrians are normally not egoistical,

00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:03.160
because in their language it is built in process.

00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:06.080
For example somebody is boasting,

00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:10.360
that I have done this, I have done that.

00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:15.400
So in Marathi they will say, " Don't climb on a bush."

00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:20.600
or what we call the tree of channa which is so big as that.

00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:24.119
Then the person is finished.

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:26.760
Like that there are many words by which

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:30.040
you can put down the ego of the man on his face.

00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:33.600
So Marathi language has so many advantages.

00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:37.919
but I would not ask you to learn Marathi language. It is not so easy.

00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:42.400
But Hindi you should. It is very easy, very easy.

00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:46.640
but you must know one  thing that in Hindi language

00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:48.440
there is 'Adab'.

00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:52.720
'Adab' means modesty

00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:58.640
and respect

00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:03.960
respect, but more than respect it is a style of saying.

00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:08.640
Not ' Urdu ' but Hindi of day - to- day talking

00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:12.560
there is respect and a way to address others,

00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:15.640
to address others.

00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:16.760
All this

00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:18.960
will give you

00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:23.480
a kind of a more

00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:26.760
flexible vehichle

00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:29.680
to express your love.

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:34.800
Because in Hindi language we can never translate 'I hate you'.

00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:36.080
We never say like that.

00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:37.960
I hate you.

00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:41.400
'I hate you' will anybody say like that ?

00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:44.520
We cannot say.

00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:46.960
To hate somebody is sinful.

00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:50.352
So they can never say,'I hate you.'

00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:57.960
Chastity is more in Marathi language

00:57:58.080 --> 00:57:59.320
but it is a little hard

00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:02.360
because it has got such as I told you

00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:07.880
......idioms which can correct you just there.

00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:16.000
All this is just to request now if you can learn this music,

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.440
which is very difficult.

00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:21.840
You can always learn a simple Hindi language

00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:26.800
which is very very easy and very very easy to talk.

00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:38.880
There are so many things , I would like you to know about Christ

00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:40.400
But this is

00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:43.560
short time in which I cannot tell you.

00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:48.440
The way He had His own priorities.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:56.160
Though in the Bible He is not described fully, I should say

00:58:56.280 --> 00:59:00.160
and whatever it might have been they have reduced it.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:01.999
Maybe,

00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:05.320
and the way they practice Christianity is shocking.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:12.280
So one has to learn Christianity through the heart.

00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:13.720
No other way out.

00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:19.840
They should learn through the Heart, Heart of your Mother.

00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:22.920
May God bless you !
