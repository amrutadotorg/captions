00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:21.609
[Music]

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:40.710
the word guru comes from the one which

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:47.260
is magnetic the person who is magnetic

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:55.719
the one it attracts the attention of the

00:00:47.260 --> 00:01:04.259
seekers is the Guru also it means the

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:13.420
heaviness or you can say a person who is

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:20.259
very steady who is very deep who has the

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:27.149
knowledge and who can act like the

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:33.000
mother earth for the power of magnetism

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:36.700
in the mother earth also is called as

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:46.420
magnetic but in sanskrit is guru to

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:50.409
occur sure means the attraction of the

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:58.600
heaviness of the mother but actually it

00:01:50.409 --> 00:02:04.859
is a power of the mother earth that

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:09.369
makes us stand for he on our legs when

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:14.410
it is rotating with such a tremendous

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:18.040
speed otherwise he would be all thrown

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:25.209
away with that velocity that she is

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:33.190
moving we are still attached or we are

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:33.950
one in our balance is only because she

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:43.030
has

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:54.370
gravity this gravity has to be in a guru

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:54.370
gravity means a kind of a serious

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:07.310
understanding of oneself and one's own

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:14.060
responsibilities so a guru has to be

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:21.920
very steady in these modern times people

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:28.340
are very mobile all the time as you take

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:30.230
it all the time getting disturbed small

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:36.319
things happening here and there they get

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:41.410
it they meet people who are not of any

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:47.139
quality then they get disturbed these

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:51.859
disturbing qualities come from our

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:54.760
deficiency in our gravity a person who

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:59.630
has gravity does not get depressed

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:03.200
neither get excited not get overly

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:08.030
enthusiastic not easy

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:14.120
very sad or unhappy so he is in the

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:17.060
center he is in the center of his be the

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:23.950
most level we think a good guru is that

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.950
person who

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:50.020
just attraction towards themselves body

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:50.020
language or maybe other attractions

00:04:52.480 --> 00:05:04.840
which are gross and that's why people

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:04.840
always go to the Guru's who are false

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:18.770
who are superficial but the one who is

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:27.110
above the gravity of the mother earth

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:31.810
the gross the subtle the subtle subtler

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:38.140
in the subtlest beyond all these

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:44.720
attractions that is the one is the Guru

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:49.960
where is your attention is important if

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.960
you are the Guru wearing your attention

00:05:51.310 --> 00:06:02.210
if your attention is on the correction

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:05.780
and the nourishment of yourself are no

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:08.290
further then you are first of all the

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.290
sahaja yogi

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:22.950
and once you rise above the

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:28.380
gravitational force of materialism then

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:31.740
you could be called as the good you do

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:34.650
not need education for that in your city

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:40.260
education you need not read books you

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:43.020
need not do anything only thing is that

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:47.370
you have to have your value system

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:49.710
correctly in your value system you have

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:58.670
to first of all understand what is

00:06:49.710 --> 00:07:05.070
auspiciousness what is divine beauty and

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:09.180
what is morality of the Spirit these

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:12.860
fittings are to be alive and how to be

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:15.660
part and parcel of your being so that

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:19.380
when people see you they should say it

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:23.520
here is a person you can see who has

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:27.570
that gravity here is the person who has

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:30.750
that you then he talks to others he

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.730
talks with them he doesn't talk to

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:39.860
frivolous things

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:43.580
useless things I think which are of very

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.580
basic level

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:57.480
in an all enter crisis I would say he

00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:01.030
has a kind of a decency and a decoder so

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:04.600
not that the Guru himself has the value

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:09.160
system but through his lifestyle through

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:16.020
his own teachings through his own

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:18.430
behavior he radiates gravity plus dvdx

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.140
grammatical so either none of this

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:25.960
gravity

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:28.540
Evette discrimination let you know what

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:31.240
is your personality and what is the

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:35.530
water barometer you know how to

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:39.160
discriminate and this discrimination is

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:44.320
also actually innately comes from your

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:46.900
guru person now and then I suppose you

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:51.070
have constable you have come out of here

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:55.570
so that yeah transcendence all those

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:57.430
things through your amun-re but that

00:08:55.570 --> 00:09:05.350
does not mean that you have developed

00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:11.560
that gravity you have now achieved a

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:14.500
state if a flower is there and you push

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:16.560
it put the flower on the water it will

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.560
float

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:24.690
but when it becomes the fruit and

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:27.200
matures then you put it in the water it

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:30.780
does not feel it goes tick-tock

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:35.880
it does not get dissolved it keeps its

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:38.550
own identity that is what is to be done

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:44.070
now that you have to become the fruits

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:49.610
of reading now all of you can become

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:54.030
gurus every one of you can become goose

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:56.670
and can develop that great capacity to

00:09:54.030 --> 00:10:05.130
be being one with that cosmic

00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:09.200
consciousness completely out of the

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:09.200
clutches of the gravity of the earth

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:21.210
materialism without achieving that you

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:27.630
have no right to tell it anybody what is

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:30.840
to be done first it should be your

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:36.810
practice and preserve it in your own

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:39.590
life in your own example and then your

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:43.050
example is sufficient to convince others

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:45.510
and this is what they have to see if we

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:49.650
can develop that gravity within our

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:58.310
sense and understanding within okay well

00:10:49.650 --> 00:11:01.290
happy resides within you the joy of

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:04.440
becoming sahaja Yogi's will be really

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:09.150
effect will be really understood and

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:11.630
will be enjoyed by all of it may God

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:11.630
bless you

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:39.809
[Music]

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:41.910
you
