WEBVTT

00:16.832 --> 00:20.253
It is so heartening to see

00:20.623 --> 00:23.411
so many of Sahaja yogis

00:25.593 --> 00:29.846
seated before

00:29.861 --> 00:31.875
my eyes

00:31.889 --> 00:37.393
which are really covered with tears of joy

00:37.401 --> 00:41.926
and tremendous happiness.

00:51.756 --> 00:55.144
You have been blessed

00:55.140 --> 00:59.562
by the Grace of God

00:59.560 --> 01:04.484
to become

01:04.480 --> 01:07.894
the real baptised,

01:07.881 --> 01:12.364
the real Muslim,

01:12.361 --> 01:17.394
the real Jew,

01:17.394 --> 01:21.754
the real Christian,

01:21.754 --> 01:24.504
the real Hindu.

01:29.379 --> 01:35.287
It was to be that, in England,

01:35.269 --> 01:38.159
you have to establish Jerusalem.

01:40.319 --> 01:43.647
I need not tell you again and again

01:43.659 --> 01:49.929
how important is England in the play of Divine.

01:49.924 --> 01:55.871
Those who are Realised and have experienced

01:55.903 --> 02:00.714
know it, that this is the place,

02:00.715 --> 02:08.539
this is the country, which has to circulate the spiritual powers all over the world.

02:13.875 --> 02:18.955
Even when I have travelled in Europe

02:18.969 --> 02:22.926
and other places

02:22.936 --> 02:28.126
and I’ve seen so many seekers all over

02:28.150 --> 02:32.854
in India we have thousandfold more,

02:32.854 --> 02:38.287
despite that, a very special category of people are born in England,

02:44.414 --> 02:47.914
the Heart of Universe;

02:47.930 --> 02:51.836
where the heart has to love,

02:51.849 --> 02:54.919
has to radiate, has to circulate,

02:55.060 --> 03:00.990
carry all the dirt and filth to be cleared out of it.

03:04.372 --> 03:09.076
It’s nice to see how you all love me,

03:09.086 --> 03:14.736
and how you have accepted my love,

03:14.747 --> 03:18.039
but I would like you to see

03:18.039 --> 03:20.959
that you have to love yourself,

03:20.949 --> 03:23.199
you have to respect yourself,

03:23.204 --> 03:26.384
you have to have self-esteem

03:26.400 --> 03:30.124
and not to be

03:30.145 --> 03:34.075
driven into crazy ideas of self-pity

03:36.555 --> 03:38.794
and guilt.

03:45.414 --> 03:51.640
The lethargy, what we call the ‘left-sidedness’,

03:51.649 --> 03:53.989
has to be thrown away,

03:53.998 --> 04:00.123
just like a shell is thrown away by a bird

04:00.169 --> 04:04.224
when it comes out of its shell of an egg.

04:05.865 --> 04:09.387
The transformation has taken place, no doubt,

04:09.407 --> 04:12.556
but transmutation is the problem today.

04:14.292 --> 04:17.032
We have to change dramatically.

04:17.019 --> 04:20.596
All our misidentifications have to be dropped.

04:20.605 --> 04:24.927
We have to become what we have been aspiring for,

04:24.935 --> 04:27.117
which we have become.

04:27.117 --> 04:28.437
We have to assume.

04:28.456 --> 04:35.595
The assumption has to be not only mental, but is from the heart.

04:35.593 --> 04:39.956
The day it will be, in England, accepted from the heart

04:39.966 --> 04:44.206
the assumption which they have achieved,

04:44.276 --> 04:48.961
assumption of the powers, assumption of the state which they have achieved

04:48.961 --> 04:56.901
that is the day I would say is the real beginning of a new era for the whole humanity.

04:56.982 --> 05:00.912
The responsibility is so great,

05:00.915 --> 05:02.812
so very great,

05:02.790 --> 05:07.971
that to realise it you have to start loving yourself,

05:09.331 --> 05:11.740
having your self-esteem,

05:11.800 --> 05:14.951
understanding yourself.

05:14.970 --> 05:20.784
Now the basic problem that the Sahaj Yogis face in England

05:20.781 --> 05:21.771
is this:

05:26.132 --> 05:31.690
they blame everything to their ego

05:31.711 --> 05:34.906
that, “This is my ego which makes me do this.

05:34.908 --> 05:37.880
This is my ego which makes me think like that.

05:37.886 --> 05:40.784
This is my ego that does this wrong.”

05:40.776 --> 05:44.904
This is just the opposite,

05:44.896 --> 05:50.029
because you want to blame your ego for everything,

05:50.089 --> 05:56.142
and that’s how you do not want to go further with your progress.

05:56.140 --> 05:59.797
You think that you have been very much in the centre.

05:59.810 --> 06:01.652
It’s not true.

06:01.651 --> 06:04.117
To be in the centre means you must understand

06:04.134 --> 06:07.437
whether you have ego or superego,

06:07.446 --> 06:11.687
which is giving you this lethargy,

06:11.696 --> 06:15.167
this dullness,

06:15.170 --> 06:20.391
this kind of vague approach to things.

06:21.411 --> 06:26.154
The whole country is suffering from that, you can see it clearly.

06:26.194 --> 06:29.164
I was surprised, when I went to Portugal,

06:29.154 --> 06:31.324
that it’s like a dead, desolate place.

06:31.344 --> 06:33.724
As if people have left that place.

06:33.725 --> 06:35.944
They are not willing to rise.

06:35.944 --> 06:38.044
They are not going to come up.

06:38.047 --> 06:41.863
And this kind of

06:41.875 --> 06:45.675
desolate place which is just decaying and dying,

06:45.815 --> 06:48.939
in the huge, big buildings that were built there,

06:48.956 --> 06:51.909
is a reaction to the ego of the Portuguese.

06:51.906 --> 06:54.889
So there should be no reaction at all.

06:54.896 --> 07:00.564
There should be no reaction to what your forefathers have done or the way they have been very ego-oriented.

07:00.567 --> 07:05.884
On the contrary, to be on the centre is to have self-esteem,

07:05.858 --> 07:08.934
to understand that you have got your Realisation now,

07:08.922 --> 07:11.882
that you have been blessed specially;

07:11.942 --> 07:18.062
to accept it with love towards yourself.

07:19.862 --> 07:23.294
If you are bent upon harming yourself, nobody can stop it.

07:23.288 --> 07:25.924
You have every right to do that,

07:25.918 --> 07:27.444
you have all freedom;

07:27.433 --> 07:30.224
but freedom and license are two things.

07:30.223 --> 07:33.555
Freedom has to be based on wisdom

07:33.574 --> 07:36.881
and license is nonsense as you understand.

07:39.882 --> 07:44.677
So all the Sahaja Yogis who are here,

07:44.684 --> 07:47.227
I have to just say one thing:

07:47.223 --> 07:50.545
that you have to change dramatically.

07:50.559 --> 07:53.015
Everything you change.

07:53.009 --> 07:57.913
We have certain habits we have developed.

07:57.911 --> 08:03.761
Some of the things are the blessings of the enterprises that have been floating,

08:03.810 --> 08:07.240
which are against a proper society.

08:09.247 --> 08:13.721
These enterprises have brought in funny ideas

08:13.726 --> 08:17.561
which have ruined people, basically.

08:17.567 --> 08:19.817
You know those things very well.

08:19.827 --> 08:24.766
So, no more to play into these people who just want to make money out of you.

08:24.767 --> 08:28.472
First of all the ‘spiritual’ so called people,

08:28.487 --> 08:34.315
who are coming in this country to exploit, to float some enterprises.

08:36.625 --> 08:40.848
You have to understand that God has no enterprise.

08:40.859 --> 08:45.187
The whole world is His own enterprise and His own thing.

08:45.748 --> 08:49.197
All such people who are indulging into enterprises

08:49.256 --> 08:52.883
and are harming your brothers and sisters,

08:52.886 --> 08:56.093
you have to be specially careful about them,

08:56.106 --> 08:59.003
and dynamic so that you save them

08:59.003 --> 09:00.913
before they fall too low

09:00.932 --> 09:07.472
and it’s impossible to get them out of the clutches of these horrible people who have come.

09:10.731 --> 09:16.186
You invaded the East in a aggressive, open manner, once upon a time.

09:16.225 --> 09:20.235
Now the East is invading you in a very subtle manner.

09:22.416 --> 09:27.898
It’s not as if they are invading you in your marketing or in your jobs;

09:27.908 --> 09:30.855
they are invading you in your brains.

09:30.868 --> 09:32.655
This has to be understood,

09:32.683 --> 09:35.925
that when these gurus and these fake people come here,

09:35.933 --> 09:43.225
they are just like the people who went from here to invade India

09:43.214 --> 09:49.205
and they have better weapons than these people had.

09:49.207 --> 09:50.995
They are enslaving you.

09:50.928 --> 09:56.309
And they’ll enslave you in such a way that you can never rise from your slavery.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.509
India could rise,

09:58.519 --> 10:04.089
but you cannot rise out of that negativity which they’ll be pouring on you.

10:04.749 --> 10:09.873
So be careful as to believe into anybody who says

10:09.884 --> 10:13.965
that “I am your guide and I am your guru and you better give me so much money.”

10:15.966 --> 10:19.923
Actually, a man who lives on your money

10:19.917 --> 10:21.532
is a parasite,

10:21.567 --> 10:24.333
in simple English language.

10:24.322 --> 10:26.918
Nowadays I have to warn you

10:26.934 --> 10:31.125
there are many lamas who have been driven out of Tibet.

10:31.125 --> 10:36.365
Some of them were lamas some of them have become lamas, it has become a big craze.

10:36.365 --> 10:41.163
And they have come in this country also and have started very big enterprises by

10:41.232 --> 10:43.243
giving you courses in spiritual life.

10:43.332 --> 10:45.732
Ask them how much spiritual life they have!

10:48.633 --> 10:50.633
This is very impressive to people,

10:50.631 --> 10:54.030
to understand, because it pampers your ego very much.

10:54.052 --> 10:59.852
Buddhism was spread by Buddha,

10:59.841 --> 11:04.932
not the ‘ism’, but Buddha’s way of life

11:06.942 --> 11:11.922
and he is the one who is the killer of your ego.

11:13.751 --> 11:19.790
The people who go to Buddha must know that your ego should not be pampered.

11:19.803 --> 11:22.480
On the contrary he is all the time laughing,

11:22.494 --> 11:25.530
the way people are ego oriented.

11:25.534 --> 11:28.988
Now these people who are coming

11:28.985 --> 11:32.098
in the disguise of taking out your ego,

11:32.075 --> 11:36.089
are putting horrible spirits into you.

11:36.121 --> 11:41.754
I have to tell you very, very frankly

11:41.759 --> 11:47.590
and making you feel very low as if spiritually you are much lower than them, which you are not.

11:51.850 --> 11:54.132
You should not accept their dictates!

11:54.129 --> 11:55.632
None of you.

11:55.633 --> 11:58.712
Neither you should allow anybody to accept.

11:58.712 --> 12:01.887
Go around the whole place, the whole country

12:01.903 --> 12:05.377
and tell them the message that these thugs have come from Tibet,

12:05.373 --> 12:07.701
where they were parasites on Tibetans,

12:07.690 --> 12:10.801
made that country a very, very poor country

12:10.791 --> 12:14.964
and now they have come in this country to bring all kinds of curses upon you.

12:15.884 --> 12:16.945
So be careful.

12:16.943 --> 12:21.544
They call themselves lama and all those things, I don’t understand

12:21.543 --> 12:23.894
what sort of spiritual life they lead,

12:23.903 --> 12:26.322
what sort of nonsense they teach.

12:26.315 --> 12:28.264
First is Self Realisation.

12:29.845 --> 12:32.971
Anything that happens to you,

12:32.977 --> 12:35.604
which is beyond your control – like any vision,

12:35.607 --> 12:39.231
like anything happening to you which is your beyond your control

12:39.231 --> 12:40.731
is not your own.

12:42.886 --> 12:44.961
Supposing a person is driving a car

12:44.947 --> 12:49.516
and he just… car goes into a slide and falls into a ghat (deep mountain valley)

12:49.508 --> 12:51.576
And he said, “I had an experience!”

12:51.577 --> 12:55.826
What will you say to such a thing?

12:55.827 --> 13:00.154
That the car is not in his control.

13:00.153 --> 13:03.903
But the person believes that he had a big experience

13:03.964 --> 13:05.903
because he had a big hit on his head.

13:08.886 --> 13:14.378
The things that are beyond your control are not your own.

13:14.376 --> 13:16.718
Self Realisation is your own.

13:16.726 --> 13:20.154
Everything has to be in your own control.

13:20.168 --> 13:23.595
Like somebody starts jumping on the chair,

13:23.599 --> 13:25.455
he starts thinking, “I’m flying.”

13:25.458 --> 13:26.975
Do you fly that way?

13:26.979 --> 13:28.725
Do the birds fly that way?

13:28.719 --> 13:33.104
They know when to start and when to stop.

13:33.864 --> 13:36.783
Those who fall into these traps

13:36.797 --> 13:40.067
just start doing it by some force

13:40.068 --> 13:43.158
and what is that force is the negative force, one must understand.

13:46.009 --> 13:49.734
You should be completely in control of yourself.

13:49.755 --> 13:52.264
Whatever happens to you,

13:52.244 --> 13:56.869
is it completely under your control or not?

13:56.864 --> 13:58.839
Of course if you are driving your car

13:58.841 --> 14:00.879
and you go to a particular beautiful place,

14:00.881 --> 14:04.841
it’s a beautiful experience because you have gone there.

14:05.912 --> 14:09.000
But not the way people are thinking

14:09.010 --> 14:10.918
that if you start jumping

14:10.931 --> 14:13.188
or if you start shouting or screaming

14:13.181 --> 14:17.058
and making noises, it's something very great.

14:17.061 --> 14:20.893
Ninety-nine percent of things that are happening in this country

14:20.982 --> 14:27.491
you might called them occults, spiritualists, pentecostalist and all sorts of nonsense they call it by

14:27.489 --> 14:30.419
is nothing but the spirits.

14:30.440 --> 14:32.113
You are not there.

14:32.110 --> 14:34.543
And then the reaction of it starts

14:34.549 --> 14:38.652
and one of the first reactions, I must tell you and warn you,

14:38.679 --> 14:40.513
is cancer.

14:40.511 --> 14:42.943
Be careful of these people!

14:42.951 --> 14:44.313
Don’t go near them!

14:44.322 --> 14:49.383
Tomorrow you’ll develop cancer and come to me, “Mother, cure me.” I will not!

14:49.379 --> 14:51.089
Today you stop it.

14:52.369 --> 14:56.364
I am warning you because I’m your Mother.

14:56.350 --> 14:58.804
And I know these things look very charming

14:58.801 --> 15:02.874
and very interesting and something sensational.

15:02.890 --> 15:08.958
Whatever is the experience outside is not all God’s experience.

15:08.975 --> 15:11.328
God’s experience is only one

15:11.346 --> 15:13.378
of Self Realisation.

15:13.385 --> 15:16.488
Where you become completely in control of yourself

15:16.495 --> 15:20.158
and you feel the energy of God flowing through you.

15:20.176 --> 15:23.765
Now the energy of God also some people say has to be hot.

15:25.096 --> 15:26.994
“You have to feel hot.”

15:27.043 --> 15:29.284
Some people feel that if you go to someone

15:29.283 --> 15:32.533
and you feel very hot energy coming from that person,

15:32.533 --> 15:34.464
is vibrations.

15:34.474 --> 15:37.094
Now any machine, which goes out of order

15:37.114 --> 15:39.774
gives hot vibrations.

15:39.794 --> 15:43.272
Any friction gives hot vibrations.

15:43.278 --> 15:47.812
But to judge it, best is for you to see what happens in Sahaja Yoga.

15:47.808 --> 15:50.832
Supposing there’s a cancer patient sitting

15:50.846 --> 15:52.702
and there’s a mad person sitting,

15:52.706 --> 15:55.706
and a one Sahaja Yogi sitting or a Born Realised is sitting.

15:56.836 --> 16:00.255
The person who has a cancer will give such heat

16:00.307 --> 16:03.311
that you’ll have to put off your heaters.

16:03.380 --> 16:06.591
The mad person also may give such heat

16:06.581 --> 16:08.538
that you will be amazed

16:08.587 --> 16:13.827
at the way the heat is coming or maybe sometimes such frozen hands it will have.

16:14.557 --> 16:16.178
He’ll have such weaknesses.

16:16.229 --> 16:18.028
His hands will be shaking.

16:18.028 --> 16:19.975
He’ll become absolutely frozen.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.703
He will go into a trance.

16:21.715 --> 16:25.612
His eyes will become transfixed.

16:25.625 --> 16:28.209
But a Realised Soul, if he is a Born Realised,

16:28.235 --> 16:31.144
he'll get a cool breeze in his hands.

16:32.139 --> 16:33.678
And you should find out

16:33.668 --> 16:36.019
what sort of sources they have come.

16:37.377 --> 16:41.287
That’s how, relatively, you can find out the absolute.

16:41.277 --> 16:45.195
The one who is suffering from cancer has got hot.

16:45.205 --> 16:47.824
The one who has been to a spiritualist

16:47.835 --> 16:51.284
and who is suffering from possession has got hot.

16:51.275 --> 16:56.604
So the one who has got the cool breeze is the one who is really  realised.

16:56.603 --> 17:00.013
On this point, many people have very funny ideas

17:00.023 --> 17:04.097
and I want to tell you clearly today,

17:04.103 --> 17:09.737
that realisation means cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

17:09.745 --> 17:11.794
It is nothing else but that.

17:11.824 --> 17:14.712
Now to maintain this,

17:14.714 --> 17:20.202
as our habits are, that we think mental activity can maintain it.

17:20.207 --> 17:21.536
It cannot.

17:21.522 --> 17:25.904
Now this lady is wonderful! She came late and now she’s going away. Why don’t you sit down?

17:25.916 --> 17:29.394
Why do you want to disturb everyone?  This is not the way you see.

17:29.388 --> 17:32.104
Now, you must have civic pride. This is not proper.

17:32.108 --> 17:35.694
Either you don't come, sit at the back, you must sit in front and disturb anybody.

17:35.716 --> 17:37.838
this is no sense of pride

17:37.846 --> 17:40.178
You sit at the back and you come forward.

17:40.179 --> 17:44.108
You see this is not proper; you must have some civic sense.

17:44.109 --> 17:49.289
That is just showing off I think to come in front in the end and then to walk off.

17:50.189 --> 17:51.771
Yes, please will you go out?

17:51.769 --> 17:54.361
I am sorry; this is not the way to behave.

17:54.369 --> 17:58.989
It's not the way to behave. You have no respect for anyone. Please go home.

18:07.979 --> 18:09.913
So I have to tell you one thing

18:09.900 --> 18:14.383
that, when you come to Sahaj Yog,

18:14.384 --> 18:17.434
you have to know that you have to find the reality.

18:18.384 --> 18:21.364
You have come here to find reality and not falsehood

18:21.404 --> 18:24.862
and whatever is falsehood whether you like it or not I’m going to say it.

18:26.412 --> 18:28.726
I have to say it,

18:28.716 --> 18:30.886
because I’m here for truth

18:30.896 --> 18:35.656
and not for getting your votes, or for any money or anything.

18:35.628 --> 18:39.763
And whatever is the truth, is to be for your good.

18:39.758 --> 18:43.393
The truth is going to adorn you, the truth is going to give you joy,

18:43.398 --> 18:47.423
it is going to make you grow, it is going to make you something different,

18:47.415 --> 18:49.805
it is going to make you absolute,

18:49.805 --> 18:52.645
it is going to give you your purpose.

18:55.865 --> 18:59.912
And in this respect, if you understand Sahaj Yog,

18:59.909 --> 19:04.372
then you will know that Sahaj Yoga  is not a mental activity

19:04.369 --> 19:08.442
by any chance,  it is not through  mental activity we can do it.

19:08.438 --> 19:13.028
For example somebody might say that, “How are we to do it, Mother?”

19:16.419 --> 19:21.049
“I’m now possessed, I don’t know how to get rid of it.”

19:21.047 --> 19:24.337
By thinking, “I’m possessed, I must get rid of it,” you cannot.

19:24.337 --> 19:27.429
It is beyond your mind.

19:27.437 --> 19:33.991
If you think by saying that, “I’m possessed, I should not be possessed,” you’ll be cleared out, you will not.

19:34.013 --> 19:40.213
For that you have to learn the technique of Sahaj Yog – after realisation, not before.

19:40.204 --> 19:44.603
For example this is the machine

19:44.555 --> 19:46.583
and you put it to the mains.

19:46.585 --> 19:51.002
You must know how to handle it after putting it to the mains, the technique,

19:51.011 --> 19:53.982
the technique that is Divine.

19:54.012 --> 19:57.902
Unless and until you master the technique that is Divine,

19:57.911 --> 20:03.452
you will not be able to keep yourself in balance and you will not grow.

20:03.472 --> 20:08.639
So that technique one has to learn. That’s why I say that transformation is very easy.

20:08.642 --> 20:12.376
To put this (microphone) into the mains is very easy, anybody can do it.

20:12.386 --> 20:20.346
But to make it work and make it work well and to utilise it fully, you have to know the technique

20:20.344 --> 20:23.751
First part of it is very simple I think,

20:23.752 --> 20:27.111
can happen to thousands very easily.

20:27.122 --> 20:31.061
But the second part you have to love yourself.

20:31.072 --> 20:32.921
You have to understand your value.

20:32.921 --> 20:36.255
You must know you are not here only for your sake;

20:36.241 --> 20:39.055
not for your sake only, not at all.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.825
You are a cell,

20:40.824 --> 20:46.782
which has to be connected to the whole, so that the whole should be substantiated,

20:46.794 --> 20:51.532
that the whole is to be helped, the whole of humanity is to be helped.

20:51.558 --> 20:55.306
You have a very, very important role to be played.

20:55.338 --> 20:59.711
So you better have your self-esteem and responsibility

20:59.724 --> 21:03.041
and understand what you have to do.

21:03.014 --> 21:07.391
After getting realisation many people, who get realisation just disappear,

21:07.384 --> 21:09.771
because they feel very happy.

21:11.490 --> 21:13.100
That’s not good.

21:13.120 --> 21:15.690
That means you have not paid full attention to yourself.

21:15.700 --> 21:19.550
You have not loved yourself; you have not understood yourself.

21:19.550 --> 21:23.998
If you have understood yourself then you should try to go deeper into it

21:24.028 --> 21:30.268
and grow, because every seed can grow into a great tree.

21:32.472 --> 21:39.320
We have to establish proper values of family life,

21:40.080 --> 21:46.928
where the family life gives that nourishment to the children to grow into spirituality.

21:47.968 --> 21:53.356
No forbidden things are there, but through vibrations you can control.

21:53.361 --> 21:59.655
When people have these cool vibrations they feel so happy about it; they don’t want to lose it.

21:59.641 --> 22:05.145
And for that sake they work it out and the family systems improve.

22:05.140 --> 22:10.171
You are going to give the model to the whole world, specially the Western world.

22:10.180 --> 22:12.901
You have to give them a new model of life,

22:12.920 --> 22:18.451
which gives them a proper, happy society

22:18.448 --> 22:25.755
and an enlightened society which knows so much more, so much more,

22:25.745 --> 22:31.425
which has eyes, which is no more blind, blinded by false ideas.

22:31.417 --> 22:36.595
All this science and all these things will drop out just like that once you know Sahaja Yoga,

22:36.607 --> 22:41.315
because all this knowledge is just a wee part of it.

22:41.319 --> 22:43.479
In Australia many people asked me,

22:43.479 --> 22:45.049
who came to interview me

22:45.159 --> 22:50.542
that, “Are your disciples all scholars?” I said, “No, they come from very ordinary lives.

22:50.592 --> 22:56.142
None of them are scholars.” Specially in Australia people are not also so well educated;

22:56.212 --> 23:00.917
they are here, because they don’t have Cambridge and Oxford I believe.

23:00.927 --> 23:07.057
And despite that, they can beat any Cambridge and Oxford fellow here in their knowledge.

23:07.067 --> 23:11.734
The knowledge is there because of the Light.

23:11.743 --> 23:17.524
Say I describe this room or England to anyone who is not here,

23:17.523 --> 23:19.324
who cannot see it.

23:19.324 --> 23:21.414
How much his knowledge would be?

23:21.494 --> 23:27.844
But the one who has lived here, who knows it, who knows each and every part of it,

23:27.874 --> 23:33.948
knows it much more than a person who might have done his MA in India about England.

23:33.905 --> 23:38.575
It’s only bookish knowledge, but here the real knowledge comes into you.

23:39.915 --> 23:43.045
The third thing is of experiencing

23:44.669 --> 23:47.557
which is very important.

23:47.549 --> 23:51.788
What have you to experience? Many people say, “Mother what should we experience?”

23:51.809 --> 23:54.807
To begin with: the thoughtless awareness

23:54.818 --> 24:02.743
that you get when the Kundalini rises about cross, about this point called as Agnya Chakra.

24:02.743 --> 24:12.788
As I have told you that Agnya Chakra is one of the most important chakras we have got where resides our Lord Jesus Christ.

24:12.781 --> 24:17.968
And why it is so important is this: because he is put there,

24:17.977 --> 24:23.665
or we can say the grace had adorned this chakra with His being,

24:23.667 --> 24:26.675
that when the Kundalini rises He’s awakened

24:26.678 --> 24:32.765
and when He’s awakened He can suck your ego and superego, all your conditionings,

24:32.768 --> 24:41.525
all your past karma and all your future problems He sucks.

24:41.514 --> 24:47.729
But that is not possible if you just ask somebody who is from a theological college to baptise,

24:47.731 --> 24:50.429
that’s all artificial, that’s not real.

24:50.410 --> 24:56.936
The real baptism you see the Kundalini rising in you. It’s a living process of a living God.

24:56.920 --> 25:01.976
Just like a seed sprouts your Kundalini sprouts and you feel it on your head.

25:01.970 --> 25:05.886
Actually feel it on your head, the cool breeze coming out.

25:05.890 --> 25:11.366
And this should happen to you otherwise it is not a Realisation.

25:13.024 --> 25:20.089
Now the experience, the second one you get is the cool breeze coming out here and cool breeze in the hands.

25:20.098 --> 25:23.229
Those people have a weak centre here

25:23.208 --> 25:28.488
do not get this cool breeze. Some people got it after two months, three months, makes no difference.

25:28.508 --> 25:33.263
But you get the cool breeze here and after that, when your hands are sensitive enough

25:33.268 --> 25:36.083
you start feeling them in the hand also.

25:36.088 --> 25:38.744
And also you can feel your centres,

25:38.753 --> 25:44.283
but those who do not feel in the hand are amazingly, are also very developed people

25:44.303 --> 25:49.893
because they can feel all these centres of other people and their own within themselves.

25:51.684 --> 25:57.846
This is the physical experience: means in your central nervous system.

25:57.854 --> 26:00.630
This you feel in your conscious mind.

26:00.640 --> 26:02.690
This is the first experience.

26:02.710 --> 26:08.250
No other experience like seeing a aura around me, or a light around me or something else,

26:08.250 --> 26:11.010
like Buddha, Christ or anything, this is no experience.

26:11.730 --> 26:14.103
This is going either to the left or to the right.

26:14.111 --> 26:18.133
In the centre you feel the cool breeze

26:18.131 --> 26:20.053
and a cool breeze from your head.

26:20.071 --> 26:24.248
This is the physical experience that you get.

26:24.244 --> 26:28.033
Now what happens to the eyes? Eyes become sparkling.

26:28.033 --> 26:29.173
They sparkle.

26:29.183 --> 26:32.118
A Sahaja yogi has sparkling eyes.

26:32.114 --> 26:35.148
This is a physical expression of that.

26:35.148 --> 26:45.963
It cannot be anything else. If somebody you find his eyes are very dull then you should know that his realisation has gone down or he’s not yet realised.

26:45.973 --> 26:50.268
Eyes are sparkling and joyous.

26:50.253 --> 26:54.418
This is only on the physical level, I would say.

26:54.418 --> 27:06.109
But in the beginning, the first experience that one starts getting is so physical and so innate, so built-in, that you are amazed at it.

27:06.108 --> 27:08.529
Then you start working on other people

27:08.543 --> 27:15.859
Say you start working on a particular person and you say, “Oh, it’s moving, it’s coming, it’s done, it’s there.”

27:15.883 --> 27:19.091
Then you start seeing how the person is imbalanced,

27:19.081 --> 27:21.923
how his one side is more, one side is less,

27:21.931 --> 27:29.311
how he has problems on his centres, the knowledge about the people, knowledge about everything

27:29.312 --> 27:36.840
Like say this flower arrangement – is it alright or not? Is this alright or not? If it is alright, you’ll start getting vibrations from that person.

27:36.860 --> 27:41.930
Anything that you think is beautiful may not be, might be very ugly.

27:41.920 --> 27:44.468
Through vibrations you will know that it is beautiful.

27:44.483 --> 27:51.604
Like, say, Mona Lisa. Mona Lisa is a thing…I mean she’s not one of these modern beauties or anything.

27:51.654 --> 27:57.963
But why she’s appreciated so much – if you see the vibrations of Mona Lisa's painting are very great.

27:57.973 --> 28:04.865
So your knowledge about things starts, means discrimination increases and you start understanding things.

28:04.863 --> 28:08.905
And this is the first experience for your brain.

28:08.895 --> 28:19.858
You start understanding people, you start understanding problems, you start understanding the problems of the whole world in a way as a spectator, as a witness.

28:19.864 --> 28:25.024
You start seeing the whole thing as a witness and then, when you start seeing that...

28:25.044 --> 28:32.838
I mean you become, again you become; it’s actualisation – then you start enjoying the joke, understanding the whole thing.

28:32.850 --> 28:38.860
You sometimes are amused, “Oh, I was the same and now they are the same!"

28:38.870 --> 28:46.511
This rat race, this madness and these emotional plays and these ego trips and everything, you start seeing it so clearly,

28:46.518 --> 28:50.861
because you have been through it and you start seeing and it amuses you.

28:50.868 --> 28:55.501
It's full of amusement and mirth and joy.

28:55.478 --> 29:02.419
Then you start seeing it also as a tragedy that’s on people is. The compassion starts flowing.

29:02.429 --> 29:06.332
You start feeling what are they doing, where are they going to crash themselves?

29:06.339 --> 29:16.532
Sometimes I am very happy when people try to tell me about others, that, “Mother, have compassion for him because he is doing it in his ignorance.”

29:16.523 --> 29:22.222
You see, I know that. I am compassion, no doubt. But when somebody says, it makes me very  happy.

29:22.212 --> 29:24.692
You become generous, absolutely generous.

29:24.692 --> 29:30.407
You do not bother about counting your pennies but you think, “What can I give?

29:30.422 --> 29:39.136
What can I give to this person? What should I give?” You are sitting down, you see a person thirsty, immediately you’ll rush for a water and bring it.

29:39.136 --> 29:44.188
Or else, otherwise normally people shout and scream and abuse.

29:44.187 --> 29:49.698
No, you become very kind, gentle and you feel the another person's needs.

29:49.698 --> 29:52.845
Immediately you run to it, you work on it.

29:52.859 --> 29:59.958
This starts working on your emotional level then, gradually, when you start working on others. You start feeling for the whole world,

29:59.975 --> 30:08.488
“Oh God! What’s going to happen? Thousands are getting lost. How are we to save them?” You start thinking about them and how to work it out.

30:08.499 --> 30:11.378
Then you start praying to God that, “Oh God! Save them.

30:11.379 --> 30:16.248
Make them also enlightened so that they enter into the Kingdom of God."

30:16.259 --> 30:25.429
And a new type of emotional flowering comes in and the fragrance of your virtues,

30:25.425 --> 30:32.841
which become so much vibrant when you are realised. Your virtues, you enjoy them.

30:32.831 --> 30:39.087
You enjoy to be truthful, you enjoy to be moral; you enjoy to respect others. You enjoy it.

30:39.091 --> 30:44.407
When virtue becomes the enjoyment then the joy is complete.

30:44.407 --> 30:53.846
Then everything is such a joy. The whole thing is such a joy. The whole meeting is such a joy and you become collectively joyous.

30:53.810 --> 30:58.936
Then you do not have very individualistic idea “my house, my room, my holiday,” “my."

30:58.950 --> 31:02.372
Then it becomes ours. You start talking,  ‘Ours’.

31:02.432 --> 31:10.832
You don’t mind any inconveniences. You see, I travel in India into villages, you know that and we have to live in all conditions there

31:10.817 --> 31:24.441
and you people are used to so many comforts. You just forget because this love, this compassion and this joy is too great to be sacrificed for any comfort of the world.

31:24.431 --> 31:33.614
And that joy, once it dawns upon you, you become so generous that you want to enjoy with others.

31:33.614 --> 31:39.157
This is the dream of Jerusalem that I see in this England

31:39.153 --> 31:46.456
and I hope that the people who are wise, who are understanding, will come down to Sahaja Yoga

31:46.453 --> 31:53.086
and see for themselves how they can transform this country into a new world.

31:53.078 --> 31:56.806
Now I am on my way to America.

31:56.818 --> 32:03.002
I am again amused at it because the people in America have different type.

32:03.052 --> 32:08.282
I mean English are difficult to crack, no doubt, that’s true,

32:08.312 --> 32:18.038
but they are a bit too steady people. They have very fixed ideas. They are people of fixed attention. For example, a person is not wearing a proper tie, for them it upsets them you see.

32:18.148 --> 32:21.950
They are very formal people

32:21.948 --> 32:32.941
and that’s how they are different type of people: they won’t accept anything readily. That’s a good thing in a way, not to accept any, because mostly you accept all nonsense very readily.

32:32.918 --> 32:37.681
But Americans are the different type. They accept everything readily and give up readily.

32:37.668 --> 32:45.402
They have a guru shopping on. All the time they are shopping for guru from one to another and just like, as I told you,

32:45.408 --> 32:52.032
they are fixing-up their screws and even when the machine stops they are fixing-up their screws (reference to Charlie Chaplin’s ‘Modern Times’ which Mother liked). They are that type of people.

32:52.040 --> 32:56.977
So it’s a very shifty sand that I am going into

32:57.077 --> 33:01.197
and you have to use your now solidarity,

33:01.267 --> 33:10.063
your fixations that you have in the faith, true faith, enlightened faith,

33:10.083 --> 33:13.593
that this world is going to change,

33:13.643 --> 33:18.071
that we are achieving it for the whole world.

33:18.081 --> 33:22.591
This will substantiate my work there very much, I know.

33:22.651 --> 33:30.734
And then their changing and their transformation will be very great.

33:30.813 --> 33:39.366
Because wherever you go, whatever you do, your attention should be fixed onto your Absolute, that is your Spirit:

33:39.377 --> 33:44.506
which is unchangeable, which cannot be destroyed, which is eternal.

33:44.507 --> 33:50.969
And that's why the English have to do something about it,

33:50.979 --> 33:54.681
to fix their attentions properly on to their Spirit.

33:54.673 --> 33:59.021
Say that, “I am the Spirit,” “I am the Spirit” and “I am the Spirit.”

33:59.019 --> 34:05.843
This will help a lot. You know you are the channels for this work for which I am going to America.

34:05.823 --> 34:10.513
And I am sure we’ll be able to fix them in their proper places.

34:10.503 --> 34:18.006
They know how to fix everything. You see they talk like this, “I’ll fix your breakfast, I’ll fix your lunch…”

34:17.996 --> 34:25.355
They fix you up everywhere and it’s like a machine they are fixing you up. Like, you are going to the airport they’ll say, “Now, all set?”

34:25.486 --> 34:31.092
Now, we're all set, what more? “Yes, all done. Everything done.” “All set? All set?”

34:31.152 --> 34:35.344
You start wondering where are they setting you to? To moon or what?

34:35.323 --> 34:37.233
So they are like that.

34:37.233 --> 34:44.824
But they are simple people in some ways because they have not yet learnt lots of cunning things

34:44.820 --> 34:52.397
because they never invaded any country – I think you picked up lots of things from other countries also when you invaded them

34:52.392 --> 35:01.887
and they are simpler people. But simple people can be simpleton also and that’s why you have to see that wisdom must be brought to them.

35:01.901 --> 35:08.927
They are all the children of God, every one different, differently made, but so beautiful.

35:08.919 --> 35:18.315
All of them have this possibility and the Spirit resides in them, the star shines, and I am going with very great hope.

35:18.329 --> 35:31.047
I am sure we’ll be able to do something there and with all your good wishes and love, I'm sure, definitely, you will get very good news from American people.

35:31.060 --> 35:33.079
May God bless you.

35:35.448 --> 35:44.256
Today is a day I am leaving, and I am very grateful to you, all of you, for taking it up so seriously and working it out.

35:44.278 --> 35:48.388
And arise and awake to your responsibilities.

35:48.383 --> 35:55.885
And try to love others and also love your self and be drenched in the Divine Love.

35:55.879 --> 35:58.305
May God Bless you.

35:58.405 --> 36:06.506
Now, if you have any questions, you may ask me about it and I’ll try to answer them.

36:06.509 --> 36:18.926
But the whole Kundalini and all that you know is a very big subject on which, I don’t know, I must have, by now, given about five hundred and one lectures – because if you include today.

36:18.932 --> 36:23.606
and there are all the tapes with you.

36:23.611 --> 36:30.086
In any case, it’s better to get the book ‘Advent’ to understand for new people

36:30.084 --> 36:37.244
and also some of the tapes to see about the details of Sahaja Yoga.

36:38.974 --> 36:40.385
May God bless you.

36:40.503 --> 36:42.413
May I have some questions?

37:07.021 --> 37:10.941
A few things for the new people I would like to say.

37:14.954 --> 37:19.928
Sahaja Yoga

37:19.914 --> 37:23.148
is a method which is born with you.

37:23.145 --> 37:26.313
Within you, the kundalini is within.

37:26.310 --> 37:33.123
It's placed in the triangular bone and is your Holy Mother, who is anxious to give you the Second Birth.

37:33.104 --> 37:44.221
And She rises, because there must be something about me, that She rises and She gives you Realisation.

37:44.224 --> 37:49.670
Now, that is a mystery in the beginning; so forget it.

37:49.682 --> 37:51.420
Doesn't matter.

37:51.421 --> 37:56.680
Once you get your Realisation then you become a guru, it's much better.

37:56.690 --> 38:02.395
I must be something, definitely, otherwise how can it be that thousands of people get Realisation in my presence.

38:02.392 --> 38:04.308
That's only conclusion you can come to.

38:04.302 --> 38:11.703
but nothing to be afraid of. I'm just like you to look at and there is nothing to be worried about.

38:11.708 --> 38:16.083
But that's a mystery, so for that you have to rise a little higher.

38:16.093 --> 38:20.893
When you establish yourself first, it is only 'Thoughtless Awareness' state.

38:20.895 --> 38:28.017
We call it as 'Nirvichara Samadhi,' then you have got thoughtless enlightened consciousness.

38:28.039 --> 38:34.187
By that, you can raise the Kundalini of others; give them Realisation; cure people. Do lots of things.

38:34.257 --> 38:39.717
But then another state of being comes up, which is called as 'Doubtless Awareness',

38:39.727 --> 38:44.006
which is called, in Sanskrit language as 'Nirvikalpa'.

38:44.017 --> 38:49.301
When that matures, then you can't say when it's not timing, it's the way you mature.

38:49.466 --> 38:54.170
You see when there's a fruit coming, when you mature.

38:54.180 --> 39:02.295
So, when you mature up to that, then you are given the Truth completely of Sahaja Yoga,

39:02.303 --> 39:06.146
which are to be given only after doubtless awareness.

39:06.135 --> 39:11.425
So. first you have to rise from thoughtless awareness to doubtless awareness, which is a state of your being;

39:11.424 --> 39:15.344
which is a state: which is not your mind or anything it is a state.

39:15.464 --> 39:19.282
by which you, you start expressing dynamic powers

39:19.352 --> 39:26.648
and when that happens, only the higher knowledge of Sahaja Yoga, which is a mystery, is to be given to you.

39:26.719 --> 39:32.688
Then you become a guru yourself. You become the guru. You become the master and then you start giving.

39:32.720 --> 39:37.074
You may say that before you start driving a car and understanding it,

39:37.078 --> 39:39.514
you play with the brake and the accelerator.

39:39.521 --> 39:42.534
Gradually you work it out, these two powers;

39:42.531 --> 39:46.024
then you become sort of, a little bit balanced;

39:46.011 --> 39:50.112
then you are appointed as a 'learning driver.'

39:50.131 --> 39:55.301
Then you have given a certificate, that alright, now you are a 'driver', but you are still a driver

39:55.440 --> 40:02.414
but then when the master sees that you are such a good driver; He is such a loving Father, that He gives you the mastery.

40:02.484 --> 40:04.114
And that's how you become a guru.

40:04.104 --> 40:07.980
All of you can become guru and there are many gurus sitting behind you,

40:07.981 --> 40:12.481
which are very great and that's how you all can become a guru.

40:12.542 --> 40:15.994
You don't have to grow any horns for that and no funny dresses.

40:15.994 --> 40:21.291
You have to be absolutely normal people, but inside you are the guru.

40:21.294 --> 40:33.573
Guru means the one, who has the magnet and the magnet is touched where the iron, the ordinary one, is touched,

40:33.570 --> 40:41.122
is a spark of the matter and that spark is the Spirit and once you become that,

40:41.122 --> 40:43.872
then you become the guru.

40:45.775 --> 40:49.235
Now the questions!

40:54.517 --> 40:56.183
What did she say?

40:56.203 --> 40:58.063
Can somebody come and tell me.

41:01.298 --> 41:02.998
Dressed?

41:03.058 --> 41:05.568
You are beautifully dressed.

41:31.973 --> 41:35.095
It will be good idea. You wanted my address. I heard only dress.

41:38.865 --> 41:43.018
You can take my address from these people, but you see the....

41:50.087 --> 41:53.748
It's not the years that matter

41:53.750 --> 41:56.950
But tell her that, you see...

41:59.000 --> 42:01.852
Yes if she's truthful, she's alright.

42:01.830 --> 42:12.162
She did. Definitely I'm sure she did, because there are so many saints in India, we have Nizamuddin, who know about this

42:12.232 --> 42:18.603
and they are very much helpful to me, but one has to be really a saint and not just a so-called saint.

42:18.623 --> 42:20.946
You see, that's the point.

42:20.953 --> 42:25.249
So I would like to meet her and you can take my address from there.

42:25.259 --> 42:31.052
I thought you were saying how should I dress for the programme.

42:31.063 --> 42:33.493
Alright, what else?

42:35.509 --> 42:37.779
You can take it from Mr Gavin Brown.

42:38.489 --> 42:40.608
And we had also putting there.

42:43.522 --> 42:45.362
Any other questions please?

42:45.412 --> 42:48.974
Are you feeling the cool breeze in the hands. Good!

42:48.969 --> 42:53.283
Please sitting down. Please put your hands like this. Now raise hands, both hands.

42:53.279 --> 42:59.513
If you take out your shoes it should help a little more to get it faster, because the Mother Earth takes your problems much more.

42:59.517 --> 43:01.993
Started already!

43:01.995 --> 43:06.195
Started, you see it works out in no time. Just take out your shoes. It will help you.

43:06.215 --> 43:09.521
You must help yourself, you see, just take out your shoes. It will be good.

43:09.519 --> 43:12.061
Put your hands like this

43:12.059 --> 43:16.199
and put both the feet on the ground. That's very important.

43:16.219 --> 43:21.250
It helps faster, I've seen it.

43:30.395 --> 43:34.365
Close your eyes please.

43:53.622 --> 43:58.722
Now, just now we have started the meditation. Alright? You can later on ask Me. Alright?

43:58.722 --> 44:00.912
Please close your eyes. Put your hands like this.

44:00.891 --> 44:06.211
You see the questioning is alright, but I would say that, it is not a mental activity. Alright?

44:06.221 --> 44:10.023
So even if I answer all your questions, you may not get Realisation.

44:10.033 --> 44:14.089
Best is to get Realisation once and for all and then we will answer all your questions.

44:14.073 --> 44:17.308
Please put your hand like this. Let's see.  Let it work out.

44:17.309 --> 44:20.719
It's better to work it out first. It's very truthful.

44:20.718 --> 44:26.418
You cannot do it with mental activity. It has to work out. It is within you. It's just like a spring and it works out.

44:26.431 --> 44:32.373
Now this gentleman sitting here, he just got it like that. He didn't ask any questions or anything.  Just like that!

44:32.369 --> 44:37.761
You see it's alright, because I know the mind is such a funny thing it goes on asking questions, but just have it.

44:37.751 --> 44:44.591
Ask him to keep quiet for a while. Your mind say that, "For the time being can you keep quiet?"

44:44.600 --> 44:51.231
Better have the experience of it. Then we'll talk about it. By talking it won't work out. Alright? So be kind to yourself.

44:51.255 --> 44:55.715
Please put your hands like this and tell your mind to be kind to you,

44:55.735 --> 44:58.135
because it thinks all the time.

44:58.126 --> 45:01.515
Close your eyes now please.

45:01.486 --> 45:03.737
Let it work out. It will work out in no time.

45:03.736 --> 45:05.987
I'm sure it will.

45:06.000 --> 45:13.000
Just allow it. Tell your mind, that, "For the time being can you keep quiet?" "For the time being."

45:19.349 --> 45:24.585
You have to help yourself. You have to tell your mind.

45:34.231 --> 45:37.998
There is nothing to doubt, because I have nothing to take from you.

45:37.997 --> 45:43.860
If I was to take anything from you then you can doubt. There's nothing selling here you see.

45:43.864 --> 45:49.678
We should give up the attitude of a shop, that you have come to receive here something.

46:17.678 --> 46:22.768
Now, put your right hand on your heart.

46:22.736 --> 46:27.676
And ask a question, "Mother am I the Spirit?" in your heart

46:27.746 --> 46:34.483
Close your eyes and ask the question. "Mother am I the Spirit?"

46:34.492 --> 46:40.552
Believe Me you are, that you ask the question for your verification,

46:40.532 --> 46:43.242
whether you are the Spirit or not.

46:48.635 --> 46:53.522
You just say, "Am I the Spirit?"

47:04.996 --> 47:06.227
Better.

47:10.954 --> 47:14.586
One thing is there, is not to feel guilty at all,

47:14.554 --> 47:17.156
because that is how we don't love ourselves.

47:17.156 --> 47:21.135
Just say, "Mother I'm not guilty." Twice you have to say, Mother I'm not guilty."

47:21.152 --> 47:23.145
Don't worry.

47:25.522 --> 47:30.592
I'm here to do all the job, so you shouldn't worry about these things.

47:30.622 --> 47:37.632
Let's see!  Say that, "Mother I'm not guilty, not at all. I'm not at all guilty."

47:52.277 --> 48:00.948
Now ask the question, "Mother am I the Spirit?"

48:00.940 --> 48:06.637
You have to forgive.  Forgive others. Just say, "Mother I forgive everyone."

48:06.652 --> 48:09.282
"I forgive." It's a big load

48:09.282 --> 48:13.330
"I forgive everyone." It's a very big load on the Spirit..

48:13.343 --> 48:17.770
"I forgive everyone." You have to forgive. Forgive everyone.

48:17.771 --> 48:20.560
Forgive yourself first of all.

48:20.563 --> 48:27.366
Do not get angry with yourself. Say, "I forgive myself and I forgive everyone."

48:27.361 --> 48:31.216
Because you are the Spirit.

48:31.206 --> 48:37.066
Spirit is not guilty

48:37.066 --> 48:43.434
and Spirit is forgiveness. Spirit is ocean of love.

48:43.452 --> 48:47.604
Spirit is ocean of compassion.

48:47.583 --> 48:50.933
You have to become that.

48:53.653 --> 49:02.889
Once you become that, then all these minor things, material things will drop out.

49:16.778 --> 49:21.166
Now, you put your right hand on your head and see if there's a cool breeze coming out.

49:21.178 --> 49:27.023
Left hand towards me and right hand... a little above your fontanel bone area.

49:27.013 --> 49:31.545
Just see if there is a cool breeze coming in.

49:34.414 --> 49:38.349
Just put it like this. I'm giving you all the balance that's all.

49:39.079 --> 49:43.400
Let's see, is there a cool breeze coming in?

49:43.409 --> 49:49.119
Move your hand a little bit and see... there's a cool breeze coming in... further and backwards.

50:02.405 --> 50:08.151
Again, good! See now! Is it there?

50:08.157 --> 50:11.787
Some people might get a little heat. Doesn't matter the heat has to go out.

50:11.782 --> 50:14.589
See for yourself.  Getting it? Good!

50:14.603 --> 50:16.962
Good.

50:18.647 --> 50:21.949
One by one all of you will get it.

50:24.691 --> 50:26.971
If any heat, you take it out like that.

50:26.981 --> 50:30.696
If there is heat. Maybe heat. Some people might have some heat coming out.

50:30.722 --> 50:33.128
If there's a heat, you just take it out.

50:33.138 --> 50:41.131
Heat is due to friction in life; tensions in life; problems, physical, mental, emotional.

50:48.346 --> 50:50.496
Is it coming out?

50:54.079 --> 50:58.587
Hah! She's got it. Those who have got it can put down their hand.

50:58.617 --> 51:01.719
Those who have got it can put down their hand.

51:01.747 --> 51:02.667
Good!

51:03.309 --> 51:05.409
In both the hands!

51:06.539 --> 51:09.879
Good, now see... Is it there?

51:11.292 --> 51:12.402
There!

51:13.652 --> 51:15.735
There!

51:19.379 --> 51:24.349
How many are new people today, please raise your hands so the Sahaja Yogis can come and look after you.

51:24.469 --> 51:29.586
Raise your hands, those who are absolutely new, who have come today.

51:29.614 --> 51:32.834
Absolutely new who have come first.

51:32.835 --> 51:40.085
Please raise your hands who have come for the first time, today!

51:50.968 --> 51:51.982
She's got it.

51:52.062 --> 51:53.422
She's got it.

51:57.898 --> 51:59.268
What is it?

52:11.466 --> 52:13.616
Hatha Yoga you mean?

52:24.506 --> 52:28.336
Hatha Yoga that you studied here? It's very physical!

52:31.062 --> 52:32.362
Which one?

52:36.492 --> 52:37.902
Which book have you read?

52:40.532 --> 52:45.165
Alright, no but I just wanted to see if you have got the Realisation.

52:45.177 --> 52:48.874
You see, for that's it.

52:48.859 --> 52:54.944
They all will have to see whether you've got the Realisation or not. They're just like you to look at, but they have got their vibrations

52:54.949 --> 52:57.614
and they are in the depth. So they feel the depth.

52:57.606 --> 53:02.942
Imagine, these 75 per cent  people sitting here are Realised Souls. Can you believe it?

53:04.757 --> 53:07.557
Maybe 80 percent even!

53:07.557 --> 53:09.174
Oh, you're all here.

53:09.187 --> 53:10.607
Happy to know.

53:12.317 --> 53:16.459
Hello,  your son, he has come?

53:16.476 --> 53:20.356
Your son, has he come? Where is he?

53:29.224 --> 53:34.729
Spain was great, I must say.  They did a good job in Spain.

53:45.560 --> 53:50.949
You give them an understanding of the thing. See what is the problem. What they are facing

53:50.960 --> 53:53.700
and all that. So talk to them and let them...

53:53.706 --> 53:56.437
How are you? Alright?

53:56.447 --> 53:57.947
How is your son now?

53:57.957 --> 53:59.907
Where is he?

53:59.887 --> 54:00.689
I'm very happy.

54:00.669 --> 54:02.090
I wanted to thank you

54:02.110 --> 54:02.801
For what?

54:02.821 --> 54:05.250
I have no arthritis in my knee.
