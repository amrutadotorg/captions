WEBVTT

00:03.080 --> 00:11.560
Today we have gathered here to do the puja of Adi Kundalini

00:11.560 --> 00:14.720
as well as your own Kundalini.

00:22.338 --> 00:28.440
First of all, I think this is the most important thing to understand

00:28.480 --> 00:31.269
about your own Kundalini,

00:31.294 --> 00:35.704
as Self-realization is Self-knowledge

00:35.821 --> 00:42.592
and the one who gives you Self Knowledge is this, your own Kundalini

00:42.727 --> 00:51.218
because, when she rises, she points it out, what are the problems on your chakras.

00:52.421 --> 00:56.468
Now, we say that it is pure desire,

00:57.819 --> 01:00.934
but we do not know what purity means.

01:01.764 --> 01:04.759
It means your chaste desire.

01:06.716 --> 01:14.016
It means it has no lust, greed, anything in it.

01:15.001 --> 01:21.122
That power is your own Mother and is settled in your triangular bone.

01:21.147 --> 01:23.280
She’s your own mother.

01:23.305 --> 01:26.884
She knows everything about you, it’s like a tape recorder.

01:27.021 --> 01:29.661
She knows everything about you

01:30.267 --> 01:44.661
and she is absolutely the knowledge — because she’s so pure.

01:49.635 --> 01:53.800
And, whatever chakras she touches,

01:54.285 --> 01:59.769
she also knows what's wrong with that chakra

02:00.907 --> 02:02.414
beforehand,

02:05.563 --> 02:08.304
so she's quite prepared,

02:09.091 --> 02:14.221
and she adjusts herself fully

02:15.979 --> 02:22.261
so that you do not get a problem by her awakening.

02:22.971 --> 02:28.261
If any chakra is constricted, she waits

02:28.301 --> 02:35.301
and goes on slowly opening that chakra.

02:37.981 --> 02:46.625
Now, this Kundalini is the primordial power which is reflected within you,

02:47.411 --> 02:50.798
and within you, in a human being,

02:51.484 --> 02:59.535
it is like many strands of energy.

03:00.445 --> 03:02.703
So it’s like a rope

03:03.875 --> 03:12.537
and these energies are all twisted together to form this Kundalini.

03:14.396 --> 03:22.541
In a human being these strands are three into seven — that is twenty-one —

03:22.541 --> 03:24.781
raised to power hundred and eight.

03:25.848 --> 03:29.288
But when your Kundalini rises,

03:29.313 --> 03:36.089
one or two strands out of this come up and pierce the fontanel bone area.

03:36.222 --> 03:37.699
Only one or two

03:40.102 --> 03:46.873
because it has to pass through the innermost nadi, known as Brahma Nadi.

03:49.880 --> 03:52.464
It’s all a spiral throughout

03:53.301 --> 04:06.552
because Kundalini is a spiral and these nadis are also are like a spiral like this.

04:06.552 --> 04:10.832
So the innermost nadi is the Brahma Nadi.

04:12.217 --> 04:18.912
The outermost nadi is the right side

04:19.890 --> 04:27.152
and the second innermost is the Ida Nadi.

04:29.288 --> 04:35.392
So, through the Brahma Nadi, she starts sending those threads.

04:36.077 --> 04:42.214
By that, they relax the center.

04:42.631 --> 04:45.538
By the relaxation of the center,

04:47.729 --> 04:53.272
the sympathetic nervous system also starts relaxing

04:54.891 --> 04:59.149
and when it goes to the Agnya Chakra,

04:59.835 --> 05:03.632
then your eyes start relaxing,

05:03.632 --> 05:06.552
your pupils start dilating

05:06.552 --> 05:12.707
and your eyes can become like Mine,

05:12.771 --> 05:16.392
very black, absolutely relaxed.

05:16.392 --> 05:19.552
So, you can easily see in a person

05:19.552 --> 05:24.867
how far is the Kundalini. If it has pierced the Agnya,

05:24.982 --> 05:29.152
then the eyes will be completely dilated and will be shining

05:29.679 --> 05:33.232
and then she enters into the Sahasrara.

05:34.674 --> 05:40.648
Now, it is absolutely pure light of knowledge,

05:41.574 --> 05:45.472
love, compassion and attention.

05:49.391 --> 05:56.076
All these three things are in that energy.

05:56.649 --> 06:00.120
We know of many energies — like electrical energy,

06:00.153 --> 06:05.770
we know of light energy, we know of other energies.

06:06.254 --> 06:12.643
But these energies cannot think, they cannot adjust,

06:12.873 --> 06:16.266
they cannot work on their own.

06:18.912 --> 06:22.312
They are to be handled by us.

06:22.337 --> 06:27.907
But this energy, itself, is the living energy

06:27.945 --> 06:31.710
and knows how to handle itself.

06:32.635 --> 06:35.400
It thinks.

06:38.741 --> 06:42.992
If you see a seed being sprouted,

06:43.461 --> 06:48.358
you’ll find at the tip of the seed there’s a small little cell

06:49.055 --> 06:53.832
which knows how to go around the soft places

06:53.872 --> 07:00.752
and then how to encircle the stones and then how to find its way to the source.

07:02.375 --> 07:08.352
That cell has got, I would say, a little Kundalini in it,

07:08.352 --> 07:10.392
the way it moves.

07:10.392 --> 07:18.872
But within you is … a tremendous force of Kundalini exists.

07:18.872 --> 07:24.792
So, you have a storehouse of compassion,

07:24.792 --> 07:30.392
which can be enlightened by the spirit.

07:30.392 --> 07:37.112
You have a storehouse of love, compassion

07:37.112 --> 07:43.672
and knowledge and ocean of forgiveness.

07:46.285 --> 07:51.552
When people get realization, they do not understand

07:51.592 --> 07:56.752
that they have to now grow. And why they don’t grow?

07:56.792 --> 08:00.992
Because they do not ask for these energies.

08:01.032 --> 08:06.592
A person who is a realized soul, if he says that,

08:06.632 --> 08:10.112
“I have to have more compassion.

08:10.845 --> 08:13.992
My compassion is not all right.

08:14.998 --> 08:19.592
My concern about others is not all right.

08:19.592 --> 08:22.272
My generosity is not all right.

08:22.312 --> 08:29.713
I’m exploiting others. I’m exploiting their love”,

08:30.195 --> 08:36.792
then this energy starts moving,

08:36.792 --> 08:41.872
giving you that greater dimension of love and compassion.

08:41.872 --> 08:47.094
But, if you do not want to be

08:55.495 --> 09:00.558
growing in your awareness, then she … she says,

09:00.592 --> 09:04.232
“All right, he is a half-baked Sahaja Yogi, let it be”,

09:04.650 --> 09:09.367
she doesn't supply that energy which is stored within you.

09:09.392 --> 09:15.790
I told you, three into seven, that is twenty-one,

09:15.815 --> 09:18.855
raised to power hundred and eight.

09:19.337 --> 09:23.423
So what a storage you have within yourself.

09:24.296 --> 09:30.632
But because of your mundane style of thinking and asking —

09:30.632 --> 09:38.592
in the beginning, when I started Sahaja Yoga people used to ask for, say, jobs

09:38.592 --> 09:43.863
or for ‘My mother is sick’ or a father is sick

09:43.924 --> 09:48.859
or they would ask for money or something like that.

09:50.411 --> 09:56.310
So these wants are not pure wants.

09:56.392 --> 09:59.552
As we know in economics, they are not pure wants.

09:59.552 --> 10:05.872
They’re impure wants because they are never satiable in general.

10:05.872 --> 10:09.352
So this Kundalini that is your Mother,

10:09.352 --> 10:14.966
she is there to supply you, nourish you, to look after you, to make you grow

10:18.402 --> 10:23.752
by giving you a higher personality —

10:31.007 --> 10:36.472
higher personality, wider personality, deeper personality.

10:39.439 --> 10:44.672
Now, we think if somebody is well read,

10:44.752 --> 10:47.072
then we think he is a higher personality.

10:49.024 --> 10:51.112
Sometimes a person who is rich,

10:51.112 --> 10:53.352
we think he is a higher personality.

10:53.392 --> 10:59.032
Sometimes we think a person who is very hard working

10:59.072 --> 11:00.992
is a higher personality.

11:00.992 --> 11:08.672
Sometimes we think a person who is, I mean,

11:08.752 --> 11:15.792
some sort of a confusion about religion or something,

11:15.792 --> 11:18.872
we think he is a higher personality.

11:19.982 --> 11:25.112
Our ideas about higher personality itself are wrong.

11:26.968 --> 11:30.752
People are higher because they are spiritually evolved.

11:30.752 --> 11:36.752
Otherwise, they are not. They go to dogs. Nobody respects them.

11:36.792 --> 11:40.432
Now we are in Germany and Germany —

11:40.432 --> 11:49.832
‘germ’ itself means actually ‘Kundalini’. Germ means in Sanskrit, as you call it, ‘ankura’.

11:49.872 --> 11:56.112
Ankura is the germ. And Germany is the place

11:56.152 --> 12:02.751
where we can have Kundalini Puja, is something really a great coincidence

12:02.782 --> 12:07.828
or I think it’s just Paramchaitanya’s arrangements.

12:08.573 --> 12:18.284
So, to look at a seed, looks like an ordinary thing, nothing special —

12:18.406 --> 12:24.752
could be very hard nut also — mostly the seeds are in nuts, mostly.

12:24.792 --> 12:32.424
If they are not in nuts, then they might be having some sheath or something, minimum.

12:32.571 --> 12:37.258
But you won’t find a seed just hanging from somewhere on a tree.

12:37.320 --> 12:40.713
It has to have some protection,

12:40.738 --> 12:45.532
some sort of a hardness outside.

12:46.038 --> 12:52.533
Now, that hardness is there,

12:52.767 --> 12:57.904
but the germ has a capacity to break that hardness.

12:58.167 --> 13:03.305
Just imagine a germ, which is such a delicate thing,

13:03.352 --> 13:06.021
which even if you touch it might break.

13:06.086 --> 13:15.129
Can break a germ... can break the covering, the hard shell?

13:15.154 --> 13:19.374
How can it do it? Isn’t it fantastic

13:20.745 --> 13:24.124
that such a hard shell,

13:24.592 --> 13:29.232
which we cannot break it with our teeth even,

13:29.272 --> 13:33.143
can be easily broken by a delicate germ.

13:34.695 --> 13:40.633
So at that time, what happens

13:42.184 --> 13:52.952
is the shell itself doesn’t become lively. It doesn’t get life.

13:54.065 --> 14:03.800
There is no movement of the shell itself, but it moves

14:04.512 --> 14:13.064
and it opens. So that delicate thing, when it grows,

14:14.016 --> 14:16.797
then the shell has to break.

14:17.832 --> 14:23.058
In the same way, this Kundalini, which is a delicate thing —

14:23.300 --> 14:28.232
if you see a person who is compassionate. “Oh,” they say,

14:28.232 --> 14:31.792
“Mother, he’s too much a gem, you know.”

14:32.708 --> 14:36.512
Everybody has sort of a sympathy,

14:36.552 --> 14:39.061
protectiveness for that person.

14:39.592 --> 14:44.746
“He’s just, Mother, he’s just compassion, and all. It’s too much.”

14:46.318 --> 14:51.941
We always feel such a person to be very — a weakling, a weak personality

14:52.508 --> 14:55.069
and that he should be protected.

14:55.750 --> 15:01.072
“Oh, Mother, he doesn’t know also how to abuse people. How will he beat anyone?

15:01.072 --> 15:05.672
He cannot even kill an ant, ant on the road.

15:05.752 --> 15:08.451
How can he do anything when he’s good for nothing?”

15:09.594 --> 15:13.592
That’s our concept, because we think

15:13.632 --> 15:18.083
we should have somebody really a tyrannical person to handle things.

15:20.512 --> 15:24.948
But just see that in a seed,

15:26.941 --> 15:34.084
it is that delicate germ grows and breaks the shell.

15:36.674 --> 15:38.752
In the same way,

15:39.100 --> 15:50.352
when we become really delicate like a germ

15:50.739 --> 16:02.072
and then grow in our delicacy and in our beauty of compassion,

16:02.072 --> 16:07.550
love and knowledge which makes you humble,

16:08.306 --> 16:11.027
then these shells will break.

16:12.789 --> 16:16.190
But it’s the other way round, normally.

16:16.854 --> 16:20.143
In Sahaja Yoga now, we have leaders.

16:20.434 --> 16:23.755
We’ve had leaders and leaders and leaders.

16:24.562 --> 16:28.736
Some of them came like tigers.

16:30.010 --> 16:32.192
I didn’t know what to do to them.

16:33.273 --> 16:38.552
Even tiger can be ridden by the Goddess Kundalini,

16:41.041 --> 16:46.872
because this love has the power to break any hard nut.

16:50.707 --> 16:53.192
So what we should ask for

16:53.232 --> 17:02.552
is that beautiful, soft, compassionate nature,

17:02.592 --> 17:05.782
and then the Kundalini will supply

17:06.076 --> 17:08.886
because she only has that.

17:12.886 --> 17:15.667
Kundalini doesn’t have anything else.

17:15.800 --> 17:23.032
All her power is of love, nothing but love.

17:24.707 --> 17:29.528
So how can she give you something she doesn't have?

17:29.580 --> 17:35.106
Supposing you hate someone, what can she do?

17:35.152 --> 17:39.500
She can't do anything because she cannot give you powers to hate.

17:42.925 --> 17:47.087
So what she says, “You hate someone, or you forgive…”

17:47.141 --> 17:49.577
She gives you the power to forgive.

17:51.126 --> 17:55.733
Like a sword has to fight a shield, not a sword.

17:57.955 --> 18:03.029
So the violence, as they say, can only be fought with non-violence.

18:03.507 --> 18:07.438
In the same way, if we have to grow,

18:07.463 --> 18:10.252
the Sahaja Yogis have to grow, first of all

18:10.277 --> 18:14.556
we have to see how softly we talk,

18:16.479 --> 18:19.042
how kindly we talk,

18:20.546 --> 18:23.224
how considerate we are.

18:28.617 --> 18:34.993
Now this is externally, but when you start doing that externally

18:35.018 --> 18:38.498
the energy starts coming internally.

18:38.592 --> 18:41.164
You might say, “Mother, even if you think —”

18:41.202 --> 18:45.118
So that’s our thinking. No, you’re thinking that time.

18:45.512 --> 18:49.952
For that thinking, the energy will come from Kundalini

18:49.952 --> 18:52.587
because you’re asking her help.

18:56.884 --> 18:59.364
Whatever she has, she is willing to give, but

18:59.389 --> 19:02.227
whatever she does not have, how can she give?

19:02.797 --> 19:05.373
Now, supposing you want to get angry,

19:05.861 --> 19:09.864
she hasn’t got the power to show anger,

19:12.492 --> 19:17.152
so how can she give you anger and temper.

19:19.063 --> 19:24.695
I mean, sometimes I try, “Let’s see if I can get into ego.”

19:27.406 --> 19:29.626
How to get, I don’t know

19:31.573 --> 19:36.403
because this Kundalini doesn’t know what is this ego,

19:36.428 --> 19:42.232
how to pamper the ego and how to make you fly in the air. No.

19:43.439 --> 19:48.272
So whatever kind of energy she is, she will give you that.

19:49.272 --> 19:51.672
So please remember,

19:51.672 --> 19:59.512
those who try to bring in assertions

19:59.552 --> 20:03.506
and conditionings and ego

20:03.531 --> 20:11.792
and all that are not going to grow because they are not getting the energy

20:11.823 --> 20:16.682
from the Kundalini, but from outside which is absolutely useless.

20:26.425 --> 20:36.392
So the power of Kundalini is absolute purity, auspiciousness,

20:37.455 --> 20:43.580
holiness, chastity, self-respect,

20:46.558 --> 20:48.461
pure love,

20:49.203 --> 20:56.672
detachment, concern, enlightened attention –

21:01.371 --> 21:03.595
to give you joy,

21:05.216 --> 21:09.570
as every mother wants that her child should get the joy.

21:12.196 --> 21:16.562
Whichever way is possible, she’ll try to give joy to her children.

21:16.587 --> 21:21.315
In the same way, this Kundalini has only one power —

21:22.737 --> 21:30.257
how to give joy to her own children – and she does that.

21:31.444 --> 21:36.192
Supposing — I mean, I don’t know about modern mothers, but normally

21:39.242 --> 21:44.072
if I would go and say to my mother,

21:44.072 --> 21:47.232
“Teach me how to be angry,”

21:47.272 --> 21:50.909
she will say, “You go and cut your nose.”

21:54.037 --> 22:00.192
If I tell her that, “Tell me how to tell lies,”

22:00.947 --> 22:04.706
she’ll say, “Go and cut your tongue.”

22:05.720 --> 22:09.472
If I say, “Tell me how to see bad things in others,”

22:09.512 --> 22:12.801
she’ll say, “take out your eyes is better.”

22:15.714 --> 22:26.512
All these ideas that we have within ourselves

22:29.077 --> 22:34.432
make a very big problem for Kundalini

22:34.472 --> 22:36.899
to enter into your attention.

22:38.555 --> 22:40.952
Now, people always ask,

22:40.992 --> 22:42.552
“Mother, how are we to grow?

22:42.552 --> 22:44.320
What should we do?”

22:45.892 --> 22:48.531
That’s why I say introspection.

22:50.470 --> 22:52.784
There should be introspection.

22:53.885 --> 22:56.744
“What do I want in this life?

22:57.232 --> 23:02.432
I should be able to love many more people

23:02.472 --> 23:05.456
without any lust or greed or expectations.”

23:08.197 --> 23:09.571
All right.

23:11.099 --> 23:20.554
Then the floods of abstract love will flow.

23:28.607 --> 23:33.952
She gives you witness state. She gives you peace.

23:34.619 --> 23:37.752
How many things she has to give you

23:39.002 --> 23:40.744
by which

23:44.369 --> 23:46.860
you become so powerful,

23:49.078 --> 23:51.389
so very powerful.

23:51.752 --> 23:54.208
No one can trouble you.

24:25.400 --> 24:28.076
She gives you security.

24:28.901 --> 24:31.772
She gives you peace.

24:32.788 --> 24:35.399
She gives you wisdom.

24:41.133 --> 24:48.032
But if you want to ask for stupidity, she cannot do it.

24:48.072 --> 24:52.032
It is impossible. She hasn’t got it with her.

24:55.935 --> 24:59.485
So every Sahaja Yogi who has to grow,

24:59.745 --> 25:11.180
must know what is in store with your own Kundalini.

25:12.974 --> 25:17.210
So now, if you try to do the other way round,

25:17.263 --> 25:19.392
you jump on the left or the right side.

25:20.663 --> 25:25.386
Jump on the left side, then you start moving on the left side,

25:27.393 --> 25:30.183
then you can become anything.

25:31.164 --> 25:37.362
Whatever we hear about people, the way they murder and rape and this and that

25:37.602 --> 25:42.221
and all these things start coming in very easily

25:43.416 --> 25:48.820
because that energy lies beyond the Kundalini.

25:52.181 --> 25:54.768
Because you move on that side —

25:54.793 --> 25:57.358
all right, you want bhoots, have them.

25:57.383 --> 25:59.474
You want diseases, have them.

25:59.499 --> 26:04.432
You want to indulge into filthy things, have the filth.

26:04.432 --> 26:07.456
Whatever you want, you can have it.

26:07.507 --> 26:10.382
Also, that is available.

26:12.079 --> 26:13.839
Nobody can stop you.

26:15.879 --> 26:17.472
You want to be sly,

26:17.512 --> 26:22.672
you want to be talking behind the backs, all right go ahead.

26:22.672 --> 26:24.672
This is also very common.

26:24.697 --> 26:27.348
I’ve heard that the Sahaja Yogis, specially ladies,

26:27.373 --> 26:31.592
go on talking behind about others, discussing.

26:31.632 --> 26:34.552
This is how we can never grow.

26:36.026 --> 26:39.512
If you have to talk, only talk good about others.

26:41.658 --> 26:44.432
Otherwise, don’t talk, best is.

26:48.104 --> 26:51.985
These things are not going to help us.

26:52.311 --> 26:57.944
Now we are not here in this world, at this stage,

26:58.069 --> 27:03.595
to build them more churches or temples or mosques. No — had enough of them,

27:04.549 --> 27:07.537
had enough of problems.

27:07.902 --> 27:12.560
So now we want to make for ourselves

27:12.591 --> 27:16.326
abode of love and purity,

27:16.371 --> 27:19.177
but those who are residents are not,

27:19.425 --> 27:22.272
then how can you have love?

27:22.850 --> 27:29.952
It will be always jealousies and selfishness and all those things there.

27:31.671 --> 27:34.912
So when we talk of the light of the Kundalini,

27:36.766 --> 27:46.592
we have to understand that this light spreads in your life,

27:47.306 --> 27:52.072
outside your life and expresses itself

27:52.112 --> 27:55.072
in a very, very beautiful manner.

27:56.668 --> 28:01.307
Everyone says that Sahaja Yogis look very different from others.

28:01.332 --> 28:06.472
“There's a glow on their face. There’s a … they look like flowers”,

28:06.512 --> 28:12.262
so many, “Relaxed. They’re very beautiful people”.

28:12.364 --> 28:15.952
For example, in Cabella people were so impressed.

28:15.952 --> 28:20.499
They said “These are young people and they have come here,

28:20.524 --> 28:24.680
they’re not fighting among themselves, there are no hooligans among them”.

28:24.680 --> 28:29.175
They’re quite surprised how could you be so sensible, so many of you.

28:29.680 --> 28:32.440
So many people if they gather anywhere,

28:32.520 --> 28:37.230
they can go amok in no time.

28:37.880 --> 28:41.600
I mean, even a smaller group

28:41.600 --> 28:43.459
can become mad.

28:43.549 --> 28:46.349
For no rhyme and reason they go mad.

28:48.837 --> 28:56.512
So this collective behavior of yours was so much seen clearly

28:57.511 --> 29:00.591
by those simple village people.

29:04.744 --> 29:09.330
For that, you have to just desire.

29:11.753 --> 29:13.908
You just have to desire

29:14.000 --> 29:18.840
and this pure desire works out in the right direction,

29:18.880 --> 29:21.640
otherwise whatever you desire you can’t get it.

29:21.680 --> 29:23.320
You want money? All right, have it.

29:23.360 --> 29:25.179
Move to the right side.

29:25.204 --> 29:29.000
Get money this way. Get money that way. Do what you like.

29:30.960 --> 29:34.590
Then you want to kill somebody. All right, get to the right side.

29:35.894 --> 29:40.288
You can get many people who will go and kill anybody they want to.

29:40.858 --> 29:44.210
Then you want some publicity or something.

29:44.235 --> 29:46.573
All right, get to the right side.

29:50.263 --> 29:55.656
All these things can happen,

29:55.793 --> 29:57.800
whatever you want

29:57.868 --> 30:02.339
according to the movement that you have.

30:04.628 --> 30:06.951
But for ascent,

30:08.928 --> 30:14.867
your desire should be pure desire

30:16.973 --> 30:22.139
to get to that greater personality

30:28.893 --> 30:34.507
of love and beautiful relationships.

30:37.087 --> 30:40.824
Today you’re worshipping your Kundalini.

30:40.849 --> 30:44.028
You are also worshipping the Adi Kundalini.

30:51.234 --> 30:54.582
Now, you have to find out

30:55.921 --> 31:00.467
what are we doing as far as the Adi Kundalini is concerned.

31:07.520 --> 31:12.880
When you worship the Adi Kundalini, the reflection in you,

31:13.617 --> 31:16.931
which is your own Kundalini, feels very happy.

31:18.067 --> 31:20.760
Also the Deities feel happy.

31:20.840 --> 31:24.440
In that happy mood, you can achieve

31:24.440 --> 31:29.240
a very much deeper experience. That’s a fact.

31:31.079 --> 31:35.938
But, to keep it up, you have to meditate,

31:35.963 --> 31:39.530
otherwise all these strands will go back, slip down,

31:40.383 --> 31:43.275
which have come out in the puja.

31:44.396 --> 31:48.840
I know everyone likes to come to puja, they enjoy it.

31:52.226 --> 31:55.782
But you should understand that,

31:56.930 --> 31:59.839
‘what do we get in this puja?’.

32:01.121 --> 32:06.720
You come here – desire for that higher life.

32:09.488 --> 32:15.280
But try to get out of this every day-to-day, nonsensical life.

32:16.363 --> 32:18.240
If you want, you can do it.

32:18.240 --> 32:20.290
It's again a question of your wanting.

32:21.381 --> 32:24.960
So throughout it is ‘want’.

32:26.342 --> 32:28.161
What is your desire?

32:32.925 --> 32:39.638
We have desire like ‘children’.

32:40.402 --> 32:42.983
Some people want to have children.

32:44.300 --> 32:47.501
After the children are born, then they say,

32:47.526 --> 32:52.120
“Wow, what these children! God save me!”

32:55.208 --> 32:59.224
Then you want to have money

33:00.500 --> 33:04.613
and most of those money people are now in jail.

33:13.649 --> 33:16.473
Then you want to have fame.

33:18.424 --> 33:23.957
The fame of the people never helps them,

33:24.639 --> 33:34.005
only it gives you problems because of jealousies and all kinds of things.

33:34.715 --> 33:37.169
If fame was such a good thing,

33:37.194 --> 33:39.241
why should people be jealous?

33:47.769 --> 33:51.408
So the power of Kundalini,

33:52.216 --> 33:54.431
which is your own mother,

33:57.236 --> 34:03.482
which has to... which has to rise, which has to come up,

34:03.578 --> 34:06.491
which has to manifest itself,

34:07.407 --> 34:11.323
because of your pure desire.

34:12.842 --> 34:17.760
So in your introspection, in your pujas, in your meditation,

34:17.800 --> 34:23.943
if you see for yourself why are you meditating –

34:24.314 --> 34:28.760
it is for pure desire of compassion

34:28.800 --> 34:31.974
and love to be awakened within us –

34:34.091 --> 34:36.804
you are already in the meditation,

34:37.094 --> 34:40.703
you're already growing, the growth has started.

34:40.922 --> 34:44.473
And you'll grow so fast that this shell,

34:44.791 --> 34:49.323
which is this human conditioning and egos will just break open.

34:50.667 --> 34:54.400
And then this small little thing

34:54.425 --> 34:57.612
which is only in the triangular bone —

34:57.847 --> 35:02.797
imagine in a... there’s a very little space in the triangular bone —

35:03.334 --> 35:07.437
that it comes out and manifests

35:07.615 --> 35:10.490
and can save the whole world.

35:10.882 --> 35:12.427
Just see

35:13.876 --> 35:18.558
the magnificence, the expansiveness,

35:18.808 --> 35:22.902
the greatness of this Kundalini which was within you

35:23.150 --> 35:26.957
and which came up in its full strength

35:27.124 --> 35:30.725
and has shown tremendous things.

35:33.364 --> 35:36.895
Such people are the really great people

35:37.026 --> 35:43.418
and not the people who are trying to show off

35:43.443 --> 35:48.707
some sort of a brand cloth they wear, try to show off, no.

35:49.290 --> 35:53.123
All these silly ideas and stupidities

35:53.224 --> 35:56.153
have to be given up by Sahaja Yogis

36:04.808 --> 36:13.280
so that this Kundalini wears the beautiful flowers,

36:14.317 --> 36:17.873
your words become fragrant,

36:22.801 --> 36:26.756
your glance becomes soothing,

36:28.311 --> 36:33.844
your smile becomes satisfying.

36:35.817 --> 36:38.689
Everything, all your being,

36:38.714 --> 36:45.195
is emitting nothing but goodness, righteousness, peace –

36:45.677 --> 36:48.055
above all, joy.

36:49.356 --> 36:54.156
And the joy you feel now — together

36:55.739 --> 36:59.440
when we were yesterday clapping and singing songs

36:59.465 --> 37:04.065
and we were feeling the joy at a very simple, simple music concert

37:04.891 --> 37:09.412
without any drugs, without any shouting, screaming, nothing —

37:09.453 --> 37:11.251
very simple —

37:11.743 --> 37:16.757
the joy we were feeling, it was because our Kundalini was dancing.

37:17.641 --> 37:22.933
She was so happy because what were you asking there?

37:24.910 --> 37:31.120
Nothing but the enjoyment of collectivity.

37:32.786 --> 37:38.200
Collectivity doesn't mean that we all should be stuck together with some glue

37:38.240 --> 37:43.180
or something or we all become like Gibraltar,

37:43.610 --> 37:46.792
Rock of Gibraltar. No, it doesn’t mean that.

37:47.440 --> 37:51.204
It means wherever you are, you are connected.

37:52.634 --> 37:54.540
That is collectivity.

37:54.782 --> 38:02.709
A connected doesn’t mean that you hate that person. No,

38:03.204 --> 38:06.559
you’re connected means you love that person,

38:07.200 --> 38:10.392
you’re concerned about that person.

38:10.966 --> 38:17.223
The connection, the connecting line, is of love and not of hatred.

38:17.520 --> 38:23.496
So, when you are connected with another person, or persons,

38:25.103 --> 38:28.149
then you are in collectivity.

38:28.265 --> 38:33.527
But people will live together and everyday break each other’s heads.

38:35.407 --> 38:40.677
Some of them really give me headaches, I tell you, sometimes because

38:43.592 --> 38:49.638
they are nowhere near the real growth of Sahaja Yoga.

38:51.428 --> 38:56.380
So you may be in America, you may be in India,

38:56.405 --> 38:58.331
you may be anywhere.

38:58.619 --> 39:00.552
You are just connected.

39:01.310 --> 39:03.395
And you are concerned.

39:03.531 --> 39:06.346
As soon as there’s a problem somewhere,

39:06.441 --> 39:11.066
into any part, any part of the world,

39:13.110 --> 39:18.080
you are connected and you’re effective, you can manage.

39:20.110 --> 39:24.160
But if you are not connected and you are just glued together,

39:24.200 --> 39:29.916
it’s very inconvenient to live under such circumstances.

39:30.481 --> 39:34.840
I think people don’t even understand the meaning of collectivity

39:36.029 --> 39:38.759
where there’s not the other,

39:38.784 --> 39:42.211
ananya, where there’s not the other,

39:43.125 --> 39:45.464
there’s no other personality.

39:48.416 --> 39:53.886
These personalities are separated from you

39:53.911 --> 39:58.951
because of left and right or could be both.

40:02.612 --> 40:05.666
But you are yourself fully

40:06.150 --> 40:09.440
when you’re absolutely detached

40:09.440 --> 40:12.760
and your Kundalini is dancing.

40:12.760 --> 40:15.971
You're alone and never alone.

40:22.661 --> 40:26.455
This oneness with the whole

40:28.218 --> 40:32.980
gives you all the security that you want,

40:33.005 --> 40:34.948
all the joy you want

40:37.615 --> 40:43.830
and that's why Kundalini Awakening means collectivity.

40:45.541 --> 40:52.541
Unless and until you want pure collectivity in your being,

40:53.330 --> 40:55.623
Kundalini won't rise.

40:57.477 --> 41:01.234
I feel sad sometimes when people tell me,

41:01.324 --> 41:05.114
“This gentleman is like this, this lady’s like this

41:05.139 --> 41:08.109
and she just says things like that

41:08.247 --> 41:14.467
and she tries to put down her orders” or some man like that.

41:14.718 --> 41:18.201
And I really can’t understand what are they doing here.

41:20.753 --> 41:22.928
We don’t want Hitlers.

41:26.633 --> 41:34.001
This attitude of ours, so far has been on a different level,

41:34.026 --> 41:38.240
like acquire more money, acquire more wealth, acquire more houses,

41:38.280 --> 41:43.754
acquire more cars, acquire more wives, husbands, whatever it is, children.

41:45.400 --> 41:48.640
But the whole thing changes in Sahaja Yoga.

41:48.680 --> 41:50.988
You enjoy everything.

41:51.183 --> 41:53.655
All right, this is your hall,

41:53.680 --> 41:56.708
doesn’t matter whosoever it … I am enjoying.

41:56.733 --> 41:59.493
It’s better not to pay for it and enjoy

42:02.113 --> 42:04.228
other people’s money!

42:08.909 --> 42:12.532
This carpet is not mine, very good. That’s excellent.

42:13.142 --> 42:15.284
It’s beautiful, I’m enjoying.

42:16.462 --> 42:20.560
Maybe the one who has got this, one must be worried about something.

42:20.585 --> 42:24.072
It might get spoiled or some such thing, but I’m enjoying.

42:27.857 --> 42:31.882
So when this detachment comes, really enjoy everything.

42:33.336 --> 42:36.908
And in that detachment only you enjoy others also

42:36.948 --> 42:40.788
because you are so detached about it, don’t want anything with anyone.

42:40.788 --> 42:43.788
Only person to person you enjoy.

42:44.886 --> 42:49.202
That means you enjoy the spirit of another person

42:49.276 --> 42:53.108
through your spirit, Atmanya Atmanyat.

42:53.108 --> 42:57.684
It is through the spirit only you enjoy another’s spirit.

43:01.903 --> 43:05.028
And then the spirit itself is, as you know,

43:05.068 --> 43:07.512
is the source of knowledge.

43:08.527 --> 43:15.799
The light of the spirit is the light of love, compassion, forgiveness, everything.

43:21.479 --> 43:25.068
All that starts shining in through your faces.

43:25.068 --> 43:27.439
I mean, from faces you can make out a Sahaja Yogi.

43:27.464 --> 43:29.689
There’s no need to put hands and see.

43:29.714 --> 43:34.050
You know this is a Sahaja Yogi, can’t be anything else.

43:40.410 --> 43:43.523
So the relationship with the Adi Kundalini

43:43.548 --> 43:48.548
is that it is the reflection of the Adi Kundalini.

43:50.032 --> 43:53.930
Now the reflection — supposing you take an Indian mirror;

43:54.279 --> 44:00.455
you look in the mirror and you find you look like nothing on earth,

44:01.283 --> 44:05.708
it will just cut you into three pieces, maybe, or anything.

44:07.245 --> 44:10.108
But if you take a Belgian mirror, say,

44:10.711 --> 44:15.210
then the reflection is correct, full –

44:15.668 --> 44:18.548
but still not three dimensional.

44:19.473 --> 44:24.267
But this is a four dimensional reflection —

44:24.292 --> 44:29.586
four dimensional, what is called as turya state.

44:30.666 --> 44:37.268
And that four dimensional personality

44:39.565 --> 44:47.468
you have reflected because of your reflector of your desire.

44:48.844 --> 44:54.856
The reflector is the desire and the reflection is complete.

44:59.745 --> 45:04.229
So when you worship the Adi Kundalini,

45:04.362 --> 45:08.214
what you are trying to do is to cleanse your Kundalini

45:08.239 --> 45:10.919
as well as please the Deities.

45:12.922 --> 45:15.951
Because this is an object,

45:16.541 --> 45:20.157
it is object, it is not to be changed –

45:20.268 --> 45:23.516
but the reflection can change.

45:31.254 --> 45:35.308
The movement of Kundalini also depends

45:35.348 --> 45:38.382
on the temperament of the person,

45:39.806 --> 45:44.713
what sort of a desire he has for his Kundalini to rise.

45:44.993 --> 45:47.881
First of all, there are people who doubt.

45:48.516 --> 45:50.936
They don’t even believe there is Kundalini.

45:50.961 --> 45:52.950
All right, even if they believe, they say,

45:52.975 --> 45:56.437
“Oh, the air might be coming out of something else.”

45:57.391 --> 45:59.365
They don’t want to believe.

46:00.910 --> 46:03.229
So it’s dishonesty.

46:07.604 --> 46:11.268
Kundalini cannot give you dishonesty.

46:11.308 --> 46:14.628
It can give you honesty and faith in honesty.

46:21.234 --> 46:26.548
So she gives you faith in goodness, faith in honesty,

46:26.548 --> 46:32.428
not just by sermon or lecture, nothing by reading Bible or anything,

46:33.373 --> 46:37.684
but actually by actualizing the experience.

46:38.974 --> 46:41.384
Now, supposing

46:47.722 --> 46:49.151
you want

46:53.502 --> 46:55.815
to go to the garden, supposing.

46:56.409 --> 46:58.948
Just you want to go to the garden

46:59.998 --> 47:02.508
and suddenly you find in the garden.

47:03.685 --> 47:07.210
Then you will know that your desire is pure. That’s why it has worked out.

47:07.235 --> 47:09.360
“How am I in the garden?

47:09.640 --> 47:13.148
Has garden walked to me or I have walked into the garden?”

47:14.891 --> 47:18.108
All such things go on happening within you.

47:19.531 --> 47:24.125
These are miracles, as they call it, miracles of Sahaja Yoga. Is not that.

47:24.208 --> 47:29.148
Is the pure desire works it because it is powerful.

47:29.711 --> 47:31.770
It just works it.

47:34.358 --> 47:37.490
And when it works it, works the whole thing out,

47:37.552 --> 47:40.047
you develop that faith within yourself.

47:40.716 --> 47:45.263
So that faith, if it is within you,

47:47.748 --> 47:51.316
nobody can challenge that faith,

47:52.222 --> 47:55.775
which is not a blind faith but an open-eyes,

47:55.800 --> 48:02.231
experienced faith which is established within you — cannot be challenged.

48:03.191 --> 48:06.019
If you have the faith, it will be done.

48:09.468 --> 48:13.261
That’s why I always say don’t say even off-hand things

48:13.286 --> 48:15.756
because you’re Sahaja Yogis, you are connected.

48:16.764 --> 48:21.655
If you say, “Let that plane be late,” it will be.

48:22.647 --> 48:25.730
There is no need to say such things.

48:26.041 --> 48:28.747
We have had so many experiences like this.

48:28.772 --> 48:32.544
I have been telling Sahaja Yogis not to say something off-hand

48:32.589 --> 48:35.530
because you must know you are connected now.

48:36.383 --> 48:41.752
Your pure desire is now being fulfilled

48:41.777 --> 48:44.869
and you are now connected, now you are divine,

48:45.472 --> 48:48.018
you are realized souls,

48:48.736 --> 48:52.195
you are very different from others. You can’t imagine.

48:52.220 --> 48:54.420
I can't talk like this to anyone.

48:54.445 --> 48:58.211
Take any judge, for example, even from France,

49:01.003 --> 49:05.469
I can’t explain anything to them or talk to them.

49:05.494 --> 49:07.494
It’s beyond their mind.

49:07.519 --> 49:12.559
But for you, all this subtle knowledge is just being absorbed

49:12.861 --> 49:15.981
because your Kundalini’s absorbing it.

49:20.257 --> 49:26.308
Now, as it is, you know I always perspire too much. Why?

49:26.333 --> 49:29.213
Because I go on absorbing your heat.

49:29.238 --> 49:31.894
I absorb so much that I perspire.

49:31.919 --> 49:36.543
So much, despite the fact that you people are having a nice cool breeze,

49:36.988 --> 49:38.629
and I am feeling hot.

49:41.046 --> 49:44.398
So this, your Kundalini, also absorbs.

49:46.116 --> 49:51.540
But whatever you absorb is absorbed back by Me.

49:52.652 --> 49:56.697
But that becomes like a barometer.

49:56.722 --> 50:00.071
Immediately you know, “This is this. This is done.

50:00.149 --> 50:04.542
He’s very hot. He’s like this.”

50:04.797 --> 50:10.037
You immediately know, without even thinking, without for asking,

50:10.062 --> 50:13.382
without any desires, you know that this one is like that.

50:14.215 --> 50:17.716
But the same fellow will be quite friendly with others, is all right,

50:17.759 --> 50:21.696
but you just can’t stand it because your Kundalini is a barometer

50:21.721 --> 50:26.121
and she tells you what’s wrong with others, with yourself.

50:29.546 --> 50:32.698
Now, for example, Agnya is a problem, Agnya.

50:32.745 --> 50:36.148
Everybody, “Mother, Agnya is a problem. Agnya is a problem.”

50:36.988 --> 50:39.360
“Yes, I am egoistical.”

50:39.459 --> 50:42.779
No one says that — means that.

50:44.196 --> 50:49.473
So you are the one who can know about yourself that is Self Knowledge

50:49.498 --> 50:51.982
and also you can know about others

50:52.007 --> 50:55.687
because of the Kundalini’s purity, is the reflector.

50:59.163 --> 51:04.668
And the more you become a better reflector, the more Kundalini shows.

51:08.631 --> 51:12.028
So, for us it is important to know

51:12.028 --> 51:15.868
that our Kundalini’s awakened, that is the pure desire,

51:15.868 --> 51:17.628
that’s the pure mother of us.

51:17.668 --> 51:22.428
Each one has got a separate mother, individual mother,

51:22.468 --> 51:30.308
and that this Kundalini, whichever we have our own separate,

51:30.308 --> 51:33.628
different from others in a way that she...

51:33.668 --> 51:39.068
her awareness about us is different.

51:39.108 --> 51:43.788
But, in her function, in her methods,

51:43.828 --> 51:47.366
she’s just the same in everyone.

51:51.543 --> 51:56.828
She, she knows about me, she knows about you, she knows about you,

51:56.868 --> 52:01.639
so she’s different in a way, in the knowledge,

52:02.148 --> 52:07.428
but the way that she works in everyone is just the same.

52:09.415 --> 52:12.228
You wouldn’t find somebody’s Kundalini in the stomach,

52:12.253 --> 52:14.413
somebody’s in the throat.

52:15.046 --> 52:17.228
It’s in the same place

52:17.228 --> 52:21.628
and it moves the same way. It cures the same way.

52:21.668 --> 52:23.348
It works the same way,

52:23.348 --> 52:26.468
except that it has the knowledge.

52:27.091 --> 52:30.425
For example, if you have two Mercedes cars,

52:31.025 --> 52:34.370
they work the same way — exactly the same.

52:34.448 --> 52:40.304
But supposing if I have to go from here to, say, Frankfurt,

52:40.343 --> 52:44.538
then the road is circuitous, so she has to go in a circuitous way.

52:45.592 --> 52:48.834
But another Mercedes, which has to go on a straight route,

52:48.859 --> 52:50.462
it will go on a straight route.

52:50.487 --> 52:52.788
But the working is the same.

52:53.697 --> 52:57.807
Only the knowledge she has about you in particular

52:57.832 --> 53:01.526
she knows you very well out and out. Remember this.

53:01.590 --> 53:03.229
You cannot cheat her.

53:06.014 --> 53:08.315
She knows you very well

53:09.182 --> 53:12.279
and that is the reason why today we are here

53:12.304 --> 53:15.698
to worship our Kundalini, to give her all the credit,

53:15.753 --> 53:21.231
that “Oh, Mother, You have given us these great powers.

53:22.004 --> 53:25.760
You have given us this subtle knowledge within ourself.

53:26.824 --> 53:28.700
You have

53:33.733 --> 53:37.905
given us the love which encompasses the whole world”

53:39.054 --> 53:47.180
And the more and the more you become aware of her connections —

53:47.274 --> 53:50.411
very, very delicate connections —

53:52.495 --> 53:56.123
then you’ll be amazed. In one of my photographs which came out,

53:56.148 --> 54:00.204
you must have seen many, many lines going like that,

54:01.923 --> 54:04.877
but very thin lines,

54:06.501 --> 54:08.152
sharp, thin.

54:09.204 --> 54:11.440
This is how we are.

54:13.272 --> 54:16.430
Now we are all realized souls.

54:17.602 --> 54:21.532
Only thing, if we have to develop ourselves and grow,

54:21.557 --> 54:25.721
we have to ask for, desire for,

54:27.018 --> 54:30.026
something very beautiful.

54:32.166 --> 54:34.468
But our attention is moving on nonsensical things.

54:34.508 --> 54:36.630
How will you grow?

54:40.628 --> 54:43.183
That's why I said we have to meditate

54:43.221 --> 54:46.261
so we get into thoughtless awareness

54:46.294 --> 54:52.117
by which we allow the Kundalini to grow.

54:56.916 --> 55:01.157
I hope after today's program

55:01.182 --> 55:04.682
people will pay attention to their own Kundalini

55:04.707 --> 55:07.775
and not to the defects of other people.

55:07.905 --> 55:10.108
First you must grow

55:10.276 --> 55:15.356
and develop a personality of that compassion and love and everything.

55:17.205 --> 55:21.988
Then only you’ll be amazed.

55:23.197 --> 55:26.295
You’ll grow into something really,

55:27.252 --> 55:33.332
a beautiful picture of perfection as a human being.

55:36.613 --> 55:39.324
So may God bless you.
