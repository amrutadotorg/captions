00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:11.560
Today we have gathered here to do the puja of Adi Kundalini

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.720
as well as your own Kundalini.

00:00:22.338 --> 00:00:28.440
First of all, I think this is the most important thing to understand

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.269
about your own Kundalini,

00:00:31.294 --> 00:00:35.704
as Self-realization is Self-knowledge

00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:42.592
and the one who gives you Self Knowledge is this, your own Kundalini

00:00:42.727 --> 00:00:51.218
because, when she rises, she points it out, what are the problems on your chakras.

00:00:52.421 --> 00:00:56.468
Now, we say that it is pure desire,

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:00.934
but we do not know what purity means.

00:01:01.764 --> 00:01:04.759
It means your chaste desire.

00:01:06.716 --> 00:01:14.016
It means it has no lust, greed, anything in it.

00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:21.122
That power is your own Mother and is settled in your triangular bone.

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:23.280
She’s your own mother.

00:01:23.305 --> 00:01:26.884
She knows everything about you, it’s like a tape recorder.

00:01:27.021 --> 00:01:29.661
She knows everything about you

00:01:30.267 --> 00:01:44.661
and she is absolutely the knowledge — because she’s so pure.

00:01:49.635 --> 00:01:53.800
And, whatever chakras she touches,

00:01:54.285 --> 00:01:59.769
she also knows what's wrong with that chakra

00:02:00.907 --> 00:02:02.414
beforehand,

00:02:05.563 --> 00:02:08.304
so she's quite prepared,

00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:14.221
and she adjusts herself fully

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:22.261
so that you do not get a problem by her awakening.

00:02:22.971 --> 00:02:28.261
If any chakra is constricted, she waits

00:02:28.301 --> 00:02:35.301
and goes on slowly opening that chakra.

00:02:37.981 --> 00:02:46.625
Now, this Kundalini is the primordial power which is reflected within you,

00:02:47.411 --> 00:02:50.798
and within you, in a human being,

00:02:51.484 --> 00:02:59.535
it is like many strands of energy.

00:03:00.445 --> 00:03:02.703
So it’s like a rope

00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:12.537
and these energies are all twisted together to form this Kundalini.

00:03:14.396 --> 00:03:22.541
In a human being these strands are three into seven — that is twenty-one —

00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:24.781
raised to power hundred and eight.

00:03:25.848 --> 00:03:29.288
But when your Kundalini rises,

00:03:29.313 --> 00:03:36.089
one or two strands out of this come up and pierce the fontanel bone area.

00:03:36.222 --> 00:03:37.699
Only one or two

00:03:40.102 --> 00:03:46.873
because it has to pass through the innermost nadi, known as Brahma Nadi.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.464
It’s all a spiral throughout

00:03:53.301 --> 00:04:06.552
because Kundalini is a spiral and these nadis are also are like a spiral like this.

00:04:06.552 --> 00:04:10.832
So the innermost nadi is the Brahma Nadi.

00:04:12.217 --> 00:04:18.912
The outermost nadi is the right side

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:27.152
and the second innermost is the Ida Nadi.

00:04:29.288 --> 00:04:35.392
So, through the Brahma Nadi, she starts sending those threads.

00:04:36.077 --> 00:04:42.214
By that, they relax the center.

00:04:42.631 --> 00:04:45.538
By the relaxation of the center,

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:53.272
the sympathetic nervous system also starts relaxing

00:04:54.891 --> 00:04:59.149
and when it goes to the Agnya Chakra,

00:04:59.835 --> 00:05:03.632
then your eyes start relaxing,

00:05:03.632 --> 00:05:06.552
your pupils start dilating

00:05:06.552 --> 00:05:12.707
and your eyes can become like Mine,

00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:16.392
very black, absolutely relaxed.

00:05:16.392 --> 00:05:19.552
So, you can easily see in a person

00:05:19.552 --> 00:05:24.867
how far is the Kundalini. If it has pierced the Agnya,

00:05:24.982 --> 00:05:29.152
then the eyes will be completely dilated and will be shining

00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:33.232
and then she enters into the Sahasrara.

00:05:34.674 --> 00:05:40.648
Now, it is absolutely pure light of knowledge,

00:05:41.574 --> 00:05:45.472
love, compassion and attention.

00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:56.076
All these three things are in that energy.

00:05:56.649 --> 00:06:00.120
We know of many energies — like electrical energy,

00:06:00.153 --> 00:06:05.770
we know of light energy, we know of other energies.

00:06:06.254 --> 00:06:12.643
But these energies cannot think, they cannot adjust,

00:06:12.873 --> 00:06:16.266
they cannot work on their own.

00:06:18.912 --> 00:06:22.312
They are to be handled by us.

00:06:22.337 --> 00:06:27.907
But this energy, itself, is the living energy

00:06:27.945 --> 00:06:31.710
and knows how to handle itself.

00:06:32.635 --> 00:06:35.400
It thinks.

00:06:38.741 --> 00:06:42.992
If you see a seed being sprouted,

00:06:43.461 --> 00:06:48.358
you’ll find at the tip of the seed there’s a small little cell

00:06:49.055 --> 00:06:53.832
which knows how to go around the soft places

00:06:53.872 --> 00:07:00.752
and then how to encircle the stones and then how to find its way to the source.

00:07:02.375 --> 00:07:08.352
That cell has got, I would say, a little Kundalini in it,

00:07:08.352 --> 00:07:10.392
the way it moves.

00:07:10.392 --> 00:07:18.872
But within you is … a tremendous force of Kundalini exists.

00:07:18.872 --> 00:07:24.792
So, you have a storehouse of compassion,

00:07:24.792 --> 00:07:30.392
which can be enlightened by the spirit.

00:07:30.392 --> 00:07:37.112
You have a storehouse of love, compassion

00:07:37.112 --> 00:07:43.672
and knowledge and ocean of forgiveness.

00:07:46.285 --> 00:07:51.552
When people get realization, they do not understand

00:07:51.592 --> 00:07:56.752
that they have to now grow. And why they don’t grow?

00:07:56.792 --> 00:08:00.992
Because they do not ask for these energies.

00:08:01.032 --> 00:08:06.592
A person who is a realized soul, if he says that,

00:08:06.632 --> 00:08:10.112
“I have to have more compassion.

00:08:10.845 --> 00:08:13.992
My compassion is not all right.

00:08:14.998 --> 00:08:19.592
My concern about others is not all right.

00:08:19.592 --> 00:08:22.272
My generosity is not all right.

00:08:22.312 --> 00:08:29.713
I’m exploiting others. I’m exploiting their love”,

00:08:30.195 --> 00:08:36.792
then this energy starts moving,

00:08:36.792 --> 00:08:41.872
giving you that greater dimension of love and compassion.

00:08:41.872 --> 00:08:47.094
But, if you do not want to be

00:08:55.495 --> 00:09:00.558
growing in your awareness, then she … she says,

00:09:00.592 --> 00:09:04.232
“All right, he is a half-baked Sahaja Yogi, let it be”,

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:09.367
she doesn't supply that energy which is stored within you.

00:09:09.392 --> 00:09:15.790
I told you, three into seven, that is twenty-one,

00:09:15.815 --> 00:09:18.855
raised to power hundred and eight.

00:09:19.337 --> 00:09:23.423
So what a storage you have within yourself.

00:09:24.296 --> 00:09:30.632
But because of your mundane style of thinking and asking —

00:09:30.632 --> 00:09:38.592
in the beginning, when I started Sahaja Yoga people used to ask for, say, jobs

00:09:38.592 --> 00:09:43.863
or for ‘My mother is sick’ or a father is sick

00:09:43.924 --> 00:09:48.859
or they would ask for money or something like that.

00:09:50.411 --> 00:09:56.310
So these wants are not pure wants.

00:09:56.392 --> 00:09:59.552
As we know in economics, they are not pure wants.

00:09:59.552 --> 00:10:05.872
They’re impure wants because they are never satiable in general.

00:10:05.872 --> 00:10:09.352
So this Kundalini that is your Mother,

00:10:09.352 --> 00:10:14.966
she is there to supply you, nourish you, to look after you, to make you grow

00:10:18.402 --> 00:10:23.752
by giving you a higher personality —

00:10:31.007 --> 00:10:36.472
higher personality, wider personality, deeper personality.

00:10:39.439 --> 00:10:44.672
Now, we think if somebody is well read,

00:10:44.752 --> 00:10:47.072
then we think he is a higher personality.

00:10:49.024 --> 00:10:51.112
Sometimes a person who is rich,

00:10:51.112 --> 00:10:53.352
we think he is a higher personality.

00:10:53.392 --> 00:10:59.032
Sometimes we think a person who is very hard working

00:10:59.072 --> 00:11:00.992
is a higher personality.

00:11:00.992 --> 00:11:08.672
Sometimes we think a person who is, I mean,

00:11:08.752 --> 00:11:15.792
some sort of a confusion about religion or something,

00:11:15.792 --> 00:11:18.872
we think he is a higher personality.

00:11:19.982 --> 00:11:25.112
Our ideas about higher personality itself are wrong.

00:11:26.968 --> 00:11:30.752
People are higher because they are spiritually evolved.

00:11:30.752 --> 00:11:36.752
Otherwise, they are not. They go to dogs. Nobody respects them.

00:11:36.792 --> 00:11:40.432
Now we are in Germany and Germany —

00:11:40.432 --> 00:11:49.832
‘germ’ itself means actually ‘Kundalini’. Germ means in Sanskrit, as you call it, ‘ankura’.

00:11:49.872 --> 00:11:56.112
Ankura is the germ. And Germany is the place

00:11:56.152 --> 00:12:02.751
where we can have Kundalini Puja, is something really a great coincidence

00:12:02.782 --> 00:12:07.828
or I think it’s just Paramchaitanya’s arrangements.

00:12:08.573 --> 00:12:18.284
So, to look at a seed, looks like an ordinary thing, nothing special —

00:12:18.406 --> 00:12:24.752
could be very hard nut also — mostly the seeds are in nuts, mostly.

00:12:24.792 --> 00:12:32.424
If they are not in nuts, then they might be having some sheath or something, minimum.

00:12:32.571 --> 00:12:37.258
But you won’t find a seed just hanging from somewhere on a tree.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.713
It has to have some protection,

00:12:40.738 --> 00:12:45.532
some sort of a hardness outside.

00:12:46.038 --> 00:12:52.533
Now, that hardness is there,

00:12:52.767 --> 00:12:57.904
but the germ has a capacity to break that hardness.

00:12:58.167 --> 00:13:03.305
Just imagine a germ, which is such a delicate thing,

00:13:03.352 --> 00:13:06.021
which even if you touch it might break.

00:13:06.086 --> 00:13:15.129
Can break a germ... can break the covering, the hard shell?

00:13:15.154 --> 00:13:19.374
How can it do it? Isn’t it fantastic

00:13:20.745 --> 00:13:24.124
that such a hard shell,

00:13:24.592 --> 00:13:29.232
which we cannot break it with our teeth even,

00:13:29.272 --> 00:13:33.143
can be easily broken by a delicate germ.

00:13:34.695 --> 00:13:40.633
So at that time, what happens

00:13:42.184 --> 00:13:52.952
is the shell itself doesn’t become lively. It doesn’t get life.

00:13:54.065 --> 00:14:03.800
There is no movement of the shell itself, but it moves

00:14:04.512 --> 00:14:13.064
and it opens. So that delicate thing, when it grows,

00:14:14.016 --> 00:14:16.797
then the shell has to break.

00:14:17.832 --> 00:14:23.058
In the same way, this Kundalini, which is a delicate thing —

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:28.232
if you see a person who is compassionate. “Oh,” they say,

00:14:28.232 --> 00:14:31.792
“Mother, he’s too much a gem, you know.”

00:14:32.708 --> 00:14:36.512
Everybody has sort of a sympathy,

00:14:36.552 --> 00:14:39.061
protectiveness for that person.

00:14:39.592 --> 00:14:44.746
“He’s just, Mother, he’s just compassion, and all. It’s too much.”

00:14:46.318 --> 00:14:51.941
We always feel such a person to be very — a weakling, a weak personality

00:14:52.508 --> 00:14:55.069
and that he should be protected.

00:14:55.750 --> 00:15:01.072
“Oh, Mother, he doesn’t know also how to abuse people. How will he beat anyone?

00:15:01.072 --> 00:15:05.672
He cannot even kill an ant, ant on the road.

00:15:05.752 --> 00:15:08.451
How can he do anything when he’s good for nothing?”

00:15:09.594 --> 00:15:13.592
That’s our concept, because we think

00:15:13.632 --> 00:15:18.083
we should have somebody really a tyrannical person to handle things.

00:15:20.512 --> 00:15:24.948
But just see that in a seed,

00:15:26.941 --> 00:15:34.084
it is that delicate germ grows and breaks the shell.

00:15:36.674 --> 00:15:38.752
In the same way,

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:50.352
when we become really delicate like a germ

00:15:50.739 --> 00:16:02.072
and then grow in our delicacy and in our beauty of compassion,

00:16:02.072 --> 00:16:07.550
love and knowledge which makes you humble,

00:16:08.306 --> 00:16:11.027
then these shells will break.

00:16:12.789 --> 00:16:16.190
But it’s the other way round, normally.

00:16:16.854 --> 00:16:20.143
In Sahaja Yoga now, we have leaders.

00:16:20.434 --> 00:16:23.755
We’ve had leaders and leaders and leaders.

00:16:24.562 --> 00:16:28.736
Some of them came like tigers.

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:32.192
I didn’t know what to do to them.

00:16:33.273 --> 00:16:38.552
Even tiger can be ridden by the Goddess Kundalini,

00:16:41.041 --> 00:16:46.872
because this love has the power to break any hard nut.

00:16:50.707 --> 00:16:53.192
So what we should ask for

00:16:53.232 --> 00:17:02.552
is that beautiful, soft, compassionate nature,

00:17:02.592 --> 00:17:05.782
and then the Kundalini will supply

00:17:06.076 --> 00:17:08.886
because she only has that.

00:17:12.886 --> 00:17:15.667
Kundalini doesn’t have anything else.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:23.032
All her power is of love, nothing but love.

00:17:24.707 --> 00:17:29.528
So how can she give you something she doesn't have?

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:35.106
Supposing you hate someone, what can she do?

00:17:35.152 --> 00:17:39.500
She can't do anything because she cannot give you powers to hate.

00:17:42.925 --> 00:17:47.087
So what she says, “You hate someone, or you forgive…”

00:17:47.141 --> 00:17:49.577
She gives you the power to forgive.

00:17:51.126 --> 00:17:55.733
Like a sword has to fight a shield, not a sword.

00:17:57.955 --> 00:18:03.029
So the violence, as they say, can only be fought with non-violence.

00:18:03.507 --> 00:18:07.438
In the same way, if we have to grow,

00:18:07.463 --> 00:18:10.252
the Sahaja Yogis have to grow, first of all

00:18:10.277 --> 00:18:14.556
we have to see how softly we talk,

00:18:16.479 --> 00:18:19.042
how kindly we talk,

00:18:20.546 --> 00:18:23.224
how considerate we are.

00:18:28.617 --> 00:18:34.993
Now this is externally, but when you start doing that externally

00:18:35.018 --> 00:18:38.498
the energy starts coming internally.

00:18:38.592 --> 00:18:41.164
You might say, “Mother, even if you think —”

00:18:41.202 --> 00:18:45.118
So that’s our thinking. No, you’re thinking that time.

00:18:45.512 --> 00:18:49.952
For that thinking, the energy will come from Kundalini

00:18:49.952 --> 00:18:52.587
because you’re asking her help.

00:18:56.884 --> 00:18:59.364
Whatever she has, she is willing to give, but

00:18:59.389 --> 00:19:02.227
whatever she does not have, how can she give?

00:19:02.797 --> 00:19:05.373
Now, supposing you want to get angry,

00:19:05.861 --> 00:19:09.864
she hasn’t got the power to show anger,

00:19:12.492 --> 00:19:17.152
so how can she give you anger and temper.

00:19:19.063 --> 00:19:24.695
I mean, sometimes I try, “Let’s see if I can get into ego.”

00:19:27.406 --> 00:19:29.626
How to get, I don’t know

00:19:31.573 --> 00:19:36.403
because this Kundalini doesn’t know what is this ego,

00:19:36.428 --> 00:19:42.232
how to pamper the ego and how to make you fly in the air. No.

00:19:43.439 --> 00:19:48.272
So whatever kind of energy she is, she will give you that.

00:19:49.272 --> 00:19:51.672
So please remember,

00:19:51.672 --> 00:19:59.512
those who try to bring in assertions

00:19:59.552 --> 00:20:03.506
and conditionings and ego

00:20:03.531 --> 00:20:11.792
and all that are not going to grow because they are not getting the energy

00:20:11.823 --> 00:20:16.682
from the Kundalini, but from outside which is absolutely useless.

00:20:26.425 --> 00:20:36.392
So the power of Kundalini is absolute purity, auspiciousness,

00:20:37.455 --> 00:20:43.580
holiness, chastity, self-respect,

00:20:46.558 --> 00:20:48.461
pure love,

00:20:49.203 --> 00:20:56.672
detachment, concern, enlightened attention –

00:21:01.371 --> 00:21:03.595
to give you joy,

00:21:05.216 --> 00:21:09.570
as every mother wants that her child should get the joy.

00:21:12.196 --> 00:21:16.562
Whichever way is possible, she’ll try to give joy to her children.

00:21:16.587 --> 00:21:21.315
In the same way, this Kundalini has only one power —

00:21:22.737 --> 00:21:30.257
how to give joy to her own children – and she does that.

00:21:31.444 --> 00:21:36.192
Supposing — I mean, I don’t know about modern mothers, but normally

00:21:39.242 --> 00:21:44.072
if I would go and say to my mother,

00:21:44.072 --> 00:21:47.232
“Teach me how to be angry,”

00:21:47.272 --> 00:21:50.909
she will say, “You go and cut your nose.”

00:21:54.037 --> 00:22:00.192
If I tell her that, “Tell me how to tell lies,”

00:22:00.947 --> 00:22:04.706
she’ll say, “Go and cut your tongue.”

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:09.472
If I say, “Tell me how to see bad things in others,”

00:22:09.512 --> 00:22:12.801
she’ll say, “take out your eyes is better.”

00:22:15.714 --> 00:22:26.512
All these ideas that we have within ourselves

00:22:29.077 --> 00:22:34.432
make a very big problem for Kundalini

00:22:34.472 --> 00:22:36.899
to enter into your attention.

00:22:38.555 --> 00:22:40.952
Now, people always ask,

00:22:40.992 --> 00:22:42.552
“Mother, how are we to grow?

00:22:42.552 --> 00:22:44.320
What should we do?”

00:22:45.892 --> 00:22:48.531
That’s why I say introspection.

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:52.784
There should be introspection.

00:22:53.885 --> 00:22:56.744
“What do I want in this life?

00:22:57.232 --> 00:23:02.432
I should be able to love many more people

00:23:02.472 --> 00:23:05.456
without any lust or greed or expectations.”

00:23:08.197 --> 00:23:09.571
All right.

00:23:11.099 --> 00:23:20.554
Then the floods of abstract love will flow.

00:23:28.607 --> 00:23:33.952
She gives you witness state. She gives you peace.

00:23:34.619 --> 00:23:37.752
How many things she has to give you

00:23:39.002 --> 00:23:40.744
by which

00:23:44.369 --> 00:23:46.860
you become so powerful,

00:23:49.078 --> 00:23:51.389
so very powerful.

00:23:51.752 --> 00:23:54.208
No one can trouble you.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.076
She gives you security.

00:24:28.901 --> 00:24:31.772
She gives you peace.

00:24:32.788 --> 00:24:35.399
She gives you wisdom.

00:24:41.133 --> 00:24:48.032
But if you want to ask for stupidity, she cannot do it.

00:24:48.072 --> 00:24:52.032
It is impossible. She hasn’t got it with her.

00:24:55.935 --> 00:24:59.485
So every Sahaja Yogi who has to grow,

00:24:59.745 --> 00:25:11.180
must know what is in store with your own Kundalini.

00:25:12.974 --> 00:25:17.210
So now, if you try to do the other way round,

00:25:17.263 --> 00:25:19.392
you jump on the left or the right side.

00:25:20.663 --> 00:25:25.386
Jump on the left side, then you start moving on the left side,

00:25:27.393 --> 00:25:30.183
then you can become anything.

00:25:31.164 --> 00:25:37.362
Whatever we hear about people, the way they murder and rape and this and that

00:25:37.602 --> 00:25:42.221
and all these things start coming in very easily

00:25:43.416 --> 00:25:48.820
because that energy lies beyond the Kundalini.

00:25:52.181 --> 00:25:54.768
Because you move on that side —

00:25:54.793 --> 00:25:57.358
all right, you want bhoots, have them.

00:25:57.383 --> 00:25:59.474
You want diseases, have them.

00:25:59.499 --> 00:26:04.432
You want to indulge into filthy things, have the filth.

00:26:04.432 --> 00:26:07.456
Whatever you want, you can have it.

00:26:07.507 --> 00:26:10.382
Also, that is available.

00:26:12.079 --> 00:26:13.839
Nobody can stop you.

00:26:15.879 --> 00:26:17.472
You want to be sly,

00:26:17.512 --> 00:26:22.672
you want to be talking behind the backs, all right go ahead.

00:26:22.672 --> 00:26:24.672
This is also very common.

00:26:24.697 --> 00:26:27.348
I’ve heard that the Sahaja Yogis, specially ladies,

00:26:27.373 --> 00:26:31.592
go on talking behind about others, discussing.

00:26:31.632 --> 00:26:34.552
This is how we can never grow.

00:26:36.026 --> 00:26:39.512
If you have to talk, only talk good about others.

00:26:41.658 --> 00:26:44.432
Otherwise, don’t talk, best is.

00:26:48.104 --> 00:26:51.985
These things are not going to help us.

00:26:52.311 --> 00:26:57.944
Now we are not here in this world, at this stage,

00:26:58.069 --> 00:27:03.595
to build them more churches or temples or mosques. No — had enough of them,

00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:07.537
had enough of problems.

00:27:07.902 --> 00:27:12.560
So now we want to make for ourselves

00:27:12.591 --> 00:27:16.326
abode of love and purity,

00:27:16.371 --> 00:27:19.177
but those who are residents are not,

00:27:19.425 --> 00:27:22.272
then how can you have love?

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:29.952
It will be always jealousies and selfishness and all those things there.

00:27:31.671 --> 00:27:34.912
So when we talk of the light of the Kundalini,

00:27:36.766 --> 00:27:46.592
we have to understand that this light spreads in your life,

00:27:47.306 --> 00:27:52.072
outside your life and expresses itself

00:27:52.112 --> 00:27:55.072
in a very, very beautiful manner.

00:27:56.668 --> 00:28:01.307
Everyone says that Sahaja Yogis look very different from others.

00:28:01.332 --> 00:28:06.472
“There's a glow on their face. There’s a … they look like flowers”,

00:28:06.512 --> 00:28:12.262
so many, “Relaxed. They’re very beautiful people”.

00:28:12.364 --> 00:28:15.952
For example, in Cabella people were so impressed.

00:28:15.952 --> 00:28:20.499
They said “These are young people and they have come here,

00:28:20.524 --> 00:28:24.680
they’re not fighting among themselves, there are no hooligans among them”.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:29.175
They’re quite surprised how could you be so sensible, so many of you.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.440
So many people if they gather anywhere,

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:37.230
they can go amok in no time.

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:41.600
I mean, even a smaller group

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.459
can become mad.

00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:46.349
For no rhyme and reason they go mad.

00:28:48.837 --> 00:28:56.512
So this collective behavior of yours was so much seen clearly

00:28:57.511 --> 00:29:00.591
by those simple village people.

00:29:04.744 --> 00:29:09.330
For that, you have to just desire.

00:29:11.753 --> 00:29:13.908
You just have to desire

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.840
and this pure desire works out in the right direction,

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:21.640
otherwise whatever you desire you can’t get it.

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.320
You want money? All right, have it.

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.179
Move to the right side.

00:29:25.204 --> 00:29:29.000
Get money this way. Get money that way. Do what you like.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.590
Then you want to kill somebody. All right, get to the right side.

00:29:35.894 --> 00:29:40.288
You can get many people who will go and kill anybody they want to.

00:29:40.858 --> 00:29:44.210
Then you want some publicity or something.

00:29:44.235 --> 00:29:46.573
All right, get to the right side.

00:29:50.263 --> 00:29:55.656
All these things can happen,

00:29:55.793 --> 00:29:57.800
whatever you want

00:29:57.868 --> 00:30:02.339
according to the movement that you have.

00:30:04.628 --> 00:30:06.951
But for ascent,

00:30:08.928 --> 00:30:14.867
your desire should be pure desire

00:30:16.973 --> 00:30:22.139
to get to that greater personality

00:30:28.893 --> 00:30:34.507
of love and beautiful relationships.

00:30:37.087 --> 00:30:40.824
Today you’re worshipping your Kundalini.

00:30:40.849 --> 00:30:44.028
You are also worshipping the Adi Kundalini.

00:30:51.234 --> 00:30:54.582
Now, you have to find out

00:30:55.921 --> 00:31:00.467
what are we doing as far as the Adi Kundalini is concerned.

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:12.880
When you worship the Adi Kundalini, the reflection in you,

00:31:13.617 --> 00:31:16.931
which is your own Kundalini, feels very happy.

00:31:18.067 --> 00:31:20.760
Also the Deities feel happy.

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:24.440
In that happy mood, you can achieve

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:29.240
a very much deeper experience. That’s a fact.

00:31:31.079 --> 00:31:35.938
But, to keep it up, you have to meditate,

00:31:35.963 --> 00:31:39.530
otherwise all these strands will go back, slip down,

00:31:40.383 --> 00:31:43.275
which have come out in the puja.

00:31:44.396 --> 00:31:48.840
I know everyone likes to come to puja, they enjoy it.

00:31:52.226 --> 00:31:55.782
But you should understand that,

00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:59.839
‘what do we get in this puja?’.

00:32:01.121 --> 00:32:06.720
You come here – desire for that higher life.

00:32:09.488 --> 00:32:15.280
But try to get out of this every day-to-day, nonsensical life.

00:32:16.363 --> 00:32:18.240
If you want, you can do it.

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.290
It's again a question of your wanting.

00:32:21.381 --> 00:32:24.960
So throughout it is ‘want’.

00:32:26.342 --> 00:32:28.161
What is your desire?

00:32:32.925 --> 00:32:39.638
We have desire like ‘children’.

00:32:40.402 --> 00:32:42.983
Some people want to have children.

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:47.501
After the children are born, then they say,

00:32:47.526 --> 00:32:52.120
“Wow, what these children! God save me!”

00:32:55.208 --> 00:32:59.224
Then you want to have money

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:04.613
and most of those money people are now in jail.

00:33:13.649 --> 00:33:16.473
Then you want to have fame.

00:33:18.424 --> 00:33:23.957
The fame of the people never helps them,

00:33:24.639 --> 00:33:34.005
only it gives you problems because of jealousies and all kinds of things.

00:33:34.715 --> 00:33:37.169
If fame was such a good thing,

00:33:37.194 --> 00:33:39.241
why should people be jealous?

00:33:47.769 --> 00:33:51.408
So the power of Kundalini,

00:33:52.216 --> 00:33:54.431
which is your own mother,

00:33:57.236 --> 00:34:03.482
which has to... which has to rise, which has to come up,

00:34:03.578 --> 00:34:06.491
which has to manifest itself,

00:34:07.407 --> 00:34:11.323
because of your pure desire.

00:34:12.842 --> 00:34:17.760
So in your introspection, in your pujas, in your meditation,

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:23.943
if you see for yourself why are you meditating –

00:34:24.314 --> 00:34:28.760
it is for pure desire of compassion

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.974
and love to be awakened within us –

00:34:34.091 --> 00:34:36.804
you are already in the meditation,

00:34:37.094 --> 00:34:40.703
you're already growing, the growth has started.

00:34:40.922 --> 00:34:44.473
And you'll grow so fast that this shell,

00:34:44.791 --> 00:34:49.323
which is this human conditioning and egos will just break open.

00:34:50.667 --> 00:34:54.400
And then this small little thing

00:34:54.425 --> 00:34:57.612
which is only in the triangular bone —

00:34:57.847 --> 00:35:02.797
imagine in a... there’s a very little space in the triangular bone —

00:35:03.334 --> 00:35:07.437
that it comes out and manifests

00:35:07.615 --> 00:35:10.490
and can save the whole world.

00:35:10.882 --> 00:35:12.427
Just see

00:35:13.876 --> 00:35:18.558
the magnificence, the expansiveness,

00:35:18.808 --> 00:35:22.902
the greatness of this Kundalini which was within you

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:26.957
and which came up in its full strength

00:35:27.124 --> 00:35:30.725
and has shown tremendous things.

00:35:33.364 --> 00:35:36.895
Such people are the really great people

00:35:37.026 --> 00:35:43.418
and not the people who are trying to show off

00:35:43.443 --> 00:35:48.707
some sort of a brand cloth they wear, try to show off, no.

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:53.123
All these silly ideas and stupidities

00:35:53.224 --> 00:35:56.153
have to be given up by Sahaja Yogis

00:36:04.808 --> 00:36:13.280
so that this Kundalini wears the beautiful flowers,

00:36:14.317 --> 00:36:17.873
your words become fragrant,

00:36:22.801 --> 00:36:26.756
your glance becomes soothing,

00:36:28.311 --> 00:36:33.844
your smile becomes satisfying.

00:36:35.817 --> 00:36:38.689
Everything, all your being,

00:36:38.714 --> 00:36:45.195
is emitting nothing but goodness, righteousness, peace –

00:36:45.677 --> 00:36:48.055
above all, joy.

00:36:49.356 --> 00:36:54.156
And the joy you feel now — together

00:36:55.739 --> 00:36:59.440
when we were yesterday clapping and singing songs

00:36:59.465 --> 00:37:04.065
and we were feeling the joy at a very simple, simple music concert

00:37:04.891 --> 00:37:09.412
without any drugs, without any shouting, screaming, nothing —

00:37:09.453 --> 00:37:11.251
very simple —

00:37:11.743 --> 00:37:16.757
the joy we were feeling, it was because our Kundalini was dancing.

00:37:17.641 --> 00:37:22.933
She was so happy because what were you asking there?

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:31.120
Nothing but the enjoyment of collectivity.

00:37:32.786 --> 00:37:38.200
Collectivity doesn't mean that we all should be stuck together with some glue

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:43.180
or something or we all become like Gibraltar,

00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:46.792
Rock of Gibraltar. No, it doesn’t mean that.

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:51.204
It means wherever you are, you are connected.

00:37:52.634 --> 00:37:54.540
That is collectivity.

00:37:54.782 --> 00:38:02.709
A connected doesn’t mean that you hate that person. No,

00:38:03.204 --> 00:38:06.559
you’re connected means you love that person,

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.392
you’re concerned about that person.

00:38:10.966 --> 00:38:17.223
The connection, the connecting line, is of love and not of hatred.

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:23.496
So, when you are connected with another person, or persons,

00:38:25.103 --> 00:38:28.149
then you are in collectivity.

00:38:28.265 --> 00:38:33.527
But people will live together and everyday break each other’s heads.

00:38:35.407 --> 00:38:40.677
Some of them really give me headaches, I tell you, sometimes because

00:38:43.592 --> 00:38:49.638
they are nowhere near the real growth of Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:51.428 --> 00:38:56.380
So you may be in America, you may be in India,

00:38:56.405 --> 00:38:58.331
you may be anywhere.

00:38:58.619 --> 00:39:00.552
You are just connected.

00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:03.395
And you are concerned.

00:39:03.531 --> 00:39:06.346
As soon as there’s a problem somewhere,

00:39:06.441 --> 00:39:11.066
into any part, any part of the world,

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:18.080
you are connected and you’re effective, you can manage.

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:24.160
But if you are not connected and you are just glued together,

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:29.916
it’s very inconvenient to live under such circumstances.

00:39:30.481 --> 00:39:34.840
I think people don’t even understand the meaning of collectivity

00:39:36.029 --> 00:39:38.759
where there’s not the other,

00:39:38.784 --> 00:39:42.211
ananya, where there’s not the other,

00:39:43.125 --> 00:39:45.464
there’s no other personality.

00:39:48.416 --> 00:39:53.886
These personalities are separated from you

00:39:53.911 --> 00:39:58.951
because of left and right or could be both.

00:40:02.612 --> 00:40:05.666
But you are yourself fully

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:09.440
when you’re absolutely detached

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:12.760
and your Kundalini is dancing.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:15.971
You're alone and never alone.

00:40:22.661 --> 00:40:26.455
This oneness with the whole

00:40:28.218 --> 00:40:32.980
gives you all the security that you want,

00:40:33.005 --> 00:40:34.948
all the joy you want

00:40:37.615 --> 00:40:43.830
and that's why Kundalini Awakening means collectivity.

00:40:45.541 --> 00:40:52.541
Unless and until you want pure collectivity in your being,

00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:55.623
Kundalini won't rise.

00:40:57.477 --> 00:41:01.234
I feel sad sometimes when people tell me,

00:41:01.324 --> 00:41:05.114
“This gentleman is like this, this lady’s like this

00:41:05.139 --> 00:41:08.109
and she just says things like that

00:41:08.247 --> 00:41:14.467
and she tries to put down her orders” or some man like that.

00:41:14.718 --> 00:41:18.201
And I really can’t understand what are they doing here.

00:41:20.753 --> 00:41:22.928
We don’t want Hitlers.

00:41:26.633 --> 00:41:34.001
This attitude of ours, so far has been on a different level,

00:41:34.026 --> 00:41:38.240
like acquire more money, acquire more wealth, acquire more houses,

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:43.754
acquire more cars, acquire more wives, husbands, whatever it is, children.

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:48.640
But the whole thing changes in Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:50.988
You enjoy everything.

00:41:51.183 --> 00:41:53.655
All right, this is your hall,

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:56.708
doesn’t matter whosoever it … I am enjoying.

00:41:56.733 --> 00:41:59.493
It’s better not to pay for it and enjoy

00:42:02.113 --> 00:42:04.228
other people’s money!

00:42:08.909 --> 00:42:12.532
This carpet is not mine, very good. That’s excellent.

00:42:13.142 --> 00:42:15.284
It’s beautiful, I’m enjoying.

00:42:16.462 --> 00:42:20.560
Maybe the one who has got this, one must be worried about something.

00:42:20.585 --> 00:42:24.072
It might get spoiled or some such thing, but I’m enjoying.

00:42:27.857 --> 00:42:31.882
So when this detachment comes, really enjoy everything.

00:42:33.336 --> 00:42:36.908
And in that detachment only you enjoy others also

00:42:36.948 --> 00:42:40.788
because you are so detached about it, don’t want anything with anyone.

00:42:40.788 --> 00:42:43.788
Only person to person you enjoy.

00:42:44.886 --> 00:42:49.202
That means you enjoy the spirit of another person

00:42:49.276 --> 00:42:53.108
through your spirit, Atmanya Atmanyat.

00:42:53.108 --> 00:42:57.684
It is through the spirit only you enjoy another’s spirit.

00:43:01.903 --> 00:43:05.028
And then the spirit itself is, as you know,

00:43:05.068 --> 00:43:07.512
is the source of knowledge.

00:43:08.527 --> 00:43:15.799
The light of the spirit is the light of love, compassion, forgiveness, everything.

00:43:21.479 --> 00:43:25.068
All that starts shining in through your faces.

00:43:25.068 --> 00:43:27.439
I mean, from faces you can make out a Sahaja Yogi.

00:43:27.464 --> 00:43:29.689
There’s no need to put hands and see.

00:43:29.714 --> 00:43:34.050
You know this is a Sahaja Yogi, can’t be anything else.

00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:43.523
So the relationship with the Adi Kundalini

00:43:43.548 --> 00:43:48.548
is that it is the reflection of the Adi Kundalini.

00:43:50.032 --> 00:43:53.930
Now the reflection — supposing you take an Indian mirror;

00:43:54.279 --> 00:44:00.455
you look in the mirror and you find you look like nothing on earth,

00:44:01.283 --> 00:44:05.708
it will just cut you into three pieces, maybe, or anything.

00:44:07.245 --> 00:44:10.108
But if you take a Belgian mirror, say,

00:44:10.711 --> 00:44:15.210
then the reflection is correct, full –

00:44:15.668 --> 00:44:18.548
but still not three dimensional.

00:44:19.473 --> 00:44:24.267
But this is a four dimensional reflection —

00:44:24.292 --> 00:44:29.586
four dimensional, what is called as turya state.

00:44:30.666 --> 00:44:37.268
And that four dimensional personality

00:44:39.565 --> 00:44:47.468
you have reflected because of your reflector of your desire.

00:44:48.844 --> 00:44:54.856
The reflector is the desire and the reflection is complete.

00:44:59.745 --> 00:45:04.229
So when you worship the Adi Kundalini,

00:45:04.362 --> 00:45:08.214
what you are trying to do is to cleanse your Kundalini

00:45:08.239 --> 00:45:10.919
as well as please the Deities.

00:45:12.922 --> 00:45:15.951
Because this is an object,

00:45:16.541 --> 00:45:20.157
it is object, it is not to be changed –

00:45:20.268 --> 00:45:23.516
but the reflection can change.

00:45:31.254 --> 00:45:35.308
The movement of Kundalini also depends

00:45:35.348 --> 00:45:38.382
on the temperament of the person,

00:45:39.806 --> 00:45:44.713
what sort of a desire he has for his Kundalini to rise.

00:45:44.993 --> 00:45:47.881
First of all, there are people who doubt.

00:45:48.516 --> 00:45:50.936
They don’t even believe there is Kundalini.

00:45:50.961 --> 00:45:52.950
All right, even if they believe, they say,

00:45:52.975 --> 00:45:56.437
“Oh, the air might be coming out of something else.”

00:45:57.391 --> 00:45:59.365
They don’t want to believe.

00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:03.229
So it’s dishonesty.

00:46:07.604 --> 00:46:11.268
Kundalini cannot give you dishonesty.

00:46:11.308 --> 00:46:14.628
It can give you honesty and faith in honesty.

00:46:21.234 --> 00:46:26.548
So she gives you faith in goodness, faith in honesty,

00:46:26.548 --> 00:46:32.428
not just by sermon or lecture, nothing by reading Bible or anything,

00:46:33.373 --> 00:46:37.684
but actually by actualizing the experience.

00:46:38.974 --> 00:46:41.384
Now, supposing

00:46:47.722 --> 00:46:49.151
you want

00:46:53.502 --> 00:46:55.815
to go to the garden, supposing.

00:46:56.409 --> 00:46:58.948
Just you want to go to the garden

00:46:59.998 --> 00:47:02.508
and suddenly you find in the garden.

00:47:03.685 --> 00:47:07.210
Then you will know that your desire is pure. That’s why it has worked out.

00:47:07.235 --> 00:47:09.360
“How am I in the garden?

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:13.148
Has garden walked to me or I have walked into the garden?”

00:47:14.891 --> 00:47:18.108
All such things go on happening within you.

00:47:19.531 --> 00:47:24.125
These are miracles, as they call it, miracles of Sahaja Yoga. Is not that.

00:47:24.208 --> 00:47:29.148
Is the pure desire works it because it is powerful.

00:47:29.711 --> 00:47:31.770
It just works it.

00:47:34.358 --> 00:47:37.490
And when it works it, works the whole thing out,

00:47:37.552 --> 00:47:40.047
you develop that faith within yourself.

00:47:40.716 --> 00:47:45.263
So that faith, if it is within you,

00:47:47.748 --> 00:47:51.316
nobody can challenge that faith,

00:47:52.222 --> 00:47:55.775
which is not a blind faith but an open-eyes,

00:47:55.800 --> 00:48:02.231
experienced faith which is established within you — cannot be challenged.

00:48:03.191 --> 00:48:06.019
If you have the faith, it will be done.

00:48:09.468 --> 00:48:13.261
That’s why I always say don’t say even off-hand things

00:48:13.286 --> 00:48:15.756
because you’re Sahaja Yogis, you are connected.

00:48:16.764 --> 00:48:21.655
If you say, “Let that plane be late,” it will be.

00:48:22.647 --> 00:48:25.730
There is no need to say such things.

00:48:26.041 --> 00:48:28.747
We have had so many experiences like this.

00:48:28.772 --> 00:48:32.544
I have been telling Sahaja Yogis not to say something off-hand

00:48:32.589 --> 00:48:35.530
because you must know you are connected now.

00:48:36.383 --> 00:48:41.752
Your pure desire is now being fulfilled

00:48:41.777 --> 00:48:44.869
and you are now connected, now you are divine,

00:48:45.472 --> 00:48:48.018
you are realized souls,

00:48:48.736 --> 00:48:52.195
you are very different from others. You can’t imagine.

00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:54.420
I can't talk like this to anyone.

00:48:54.445 --> 00:48:58.211
Take any judge, for example, even from France,

00:49:01.003 --> 00:49:05.469
I can’t explain anything to them or talk to them.

00:49:05.494 --> 00:49:07.494
It’s beyond their mind.

00:49:07.519 --> 00:49:12.559
But for you, all this subtle knowledge is just being absorbed

00:49:12.861 --> 00:49:15.981
because your Kundalini’s absorbing it.

00:49:20.257 --> 00:49:26.308
Now, as it is, you know I always perspire too much. Why?

00:49:26.333 --> 00:49:29.213
Because I go on absorbing your heat.

00:49:29.238 --> 00:49:31.894
I absorb so much that I perspire.

00:49:31.919 --> 00:49:36.543
So much, despite the fact that you people are having a nice cool breeze,

00:49:36.988 --> 00:49:38.629
and I am feeling hot.

00:49:41.046 --> 00:49:44.398
So this, your Kundalini, also absorbs.

00:49:46.116 --> 00:49:51.540
But whatever you absorb is absorbed back by Me.

00:49:52.652 --> 00:49:56.697
But that becomes like a barometer.

00:49:56.722 --> 00:50:00.071
Immediately you know, “This is this. This is done.

00:50:00.149 --> 00:50:04.542
He’s very hot. He’s like this.”

00:50:04.797 --> 00:50:10.037
You immediately know, without even thinking, without for asking,

00:50:10.062 --> 00:50:13.382
without any desires, you know that this one is like that.

00:50:14.215 --> 00:50:17.716
But the same fellow will be quite friendly with others, is all right,

00:50:17.759 --> 00:50:21.696
but you just can’t stand it because your Kundalini is a barometer

00:50:21.721 --> 00:50:26.121
and she tells you what’s wrong with others, with yourself.

00:50:29.546 --> 00:50:32.698
Now, for example, Agnya is a problem, Agnya.

00:50:32.745 --> 00:50:36.148
Everybody, “Mother, Agnya is a problem. Agnya is a problem.”

00:50:36.988 --> 00:50:39.360
“Yes, I am egoistical.”

00:50:39.459 --> 00:50:42.779
No one says that — means that.

00:50:44.196 --> 00:50:49.473
So you are the one who can know about yourself that is Self Knowledge

00:50:49.498 --> 00:50:51.982
and also you can know about others

00:50:52.007 --> 00:50:55.687
because of the Kundalini’s purity, is the reflector.

00:50:59.163 --> 00:51:04.668
And the more you become a better reflector, the more Kundalini shows.

00:51:08.631 --> 00:51:12.028
So, for us it is important to know

00:51:12.028 --> 00:51:15.868
that our Kundalini’s awakened, that is the pure desire,

00:51:15.868 --> 00:51:17.628
that’s the pure mother of us.

00:51:17.668 --> 00:51:22.428
Each one has got a separate mother, individual mother,

00:51:22.468 --> 00:51:30.308
and that this Kundalini, whichever we have our own separate,

00:51:30.308 --> 00:51:33.628
different from others in a way that she...

00:51:33.668 --> 00:51:39.068
her awareness about us is different.

00:51:39.108 --> 00:51:43.788
But, in her function, in her methods,

00:51:43.828 --> 00:51:47.366
she’s just the same in everyone.

00:51:51.543 --> 00:51:56.828
She, she knows about me, she knows about you, she knows about you,

00:51:56.868 --> 00:52:01.639
so she’s different in a way, in the knowledge,

00:52:02.148 --> 00:52:07.428
but the way that she works in everyone is just the same.

00:52:09.415 --> 00:52:12.228
You wouldn’t find somebody’s Kundalini in the stomach,

00:52:12.253 --> 00:52:14.413
somebody’s in the throat.

00:52:15.046 --> 00:52:17.228
It’s in the same place

00:52:17.228 --> 00:52:21.628
and it moves the same way. It cures the same way.

00:52:21.668 --> 00:52:23.348
It works the same way,

00:52:23.348 --> 00:52:26.468
except that it has the knowledge.

00:52:27.091 --> 00:52:30.425
For example, if you have two Mercedes cars,

00:52:31.025 --> 00:52:34.370
they work the same way — exactly the same.

00:52:34.448 --> 00:52:40.304
But supposing if I have to go from here to, say, Frankfurt,

00:52:40.343 --> 00:52:44.538
then the road is circuitous, so she has to go in a circuitous way.

00:52:45.592 --> 00:52:48.834
But another Mercedes, which has to go on a straight route,

00:52:48.859 --> 00:52:50.462
it will go on a straight route.

00:52:50.487 --> 00:52:52.788
But the working is the same.

00:52:53.697 --> 00:52:57.807
Only the knowledge she has about you in particular

00:52:57.832 --> 00:53:01.526
she knows you very well out and out. Remember this.

00:53:01.590 --> 00:53:03.229
You cannot cheat her.

00:53:06.014 --> 00:53:08.315
She knows you very well

00:53:09.182 --> 00:53:12.279
and that is the reason why today we are here

00:53:12.304 --> 00:53:15.698
to worship our Kundalini, to give her all the credit,

00:53:15.753 --> 00:53:21.231
that “Oh, Mother, You have given us these great powers.

00:53:22.004 --> 00:53:25.760
You have given us this subtle knowledge within ourself.

00:53:26.824 --> 00:53:28.700
You have

00:53:33.733 --> 00:53:37.905
given us the love which encompasses the whole world”

00:53:39.054 --> 00:53:47.180
And the more and the more you become aware of her connections —

00:53:47.274 --> 00:53:50.411
very, very delicate connections —

00:53:52.495 --> 00:53:56.123
then you’ll be amazed. In one of my photographs which came out,

00:53:56.148 --> 00:54:00.204
you must have seen many, many lines going like that,

00:54:01.923 --> 00:54:04.877
but very thin lines,

00:54:06.501 --> 00:54:08.152
sharp, thin.

00:54:09.204 --> 00:54:11.440
This is how we are.

00:54:13.272 --> 00:54:16.430
Now we are all realized souls.

00:54:17.602 --> 00:54:21.532
Only thing, if we have to develop ourselves and grow,

00:54:21.557 --> 00:54:25.721
we have to ask for, desire for,

00:54:27.018 --> 00:54:30.026
something very beautiful.

00:54:32.166 --> 00:54:34.468
But our attention is moving on nonsensical things.

00:54:34.508 --> 00:54:36.630
How will you grow?

00:54:40.628 --> 00:54:43.183
That's why I said we have to meditate

00:54:43.221 --> 00:54:46.261
so we get into thoughtless awareness

00:54:46.294 --> 00:54:52.117
by which we allow the Kundalini to grow.

00:54:56.916 --> 00:55:01.157
I hope after today's program

00:55:01.182 --> 00:55:04.682
people will pay attention to their own Kundalini

00:55:04.707 --> 00:55:07.775
and not to the defects of other people.

00:55:07.905 --> 00:55:10.108
First you must grow

00:55:10.276 --> 00:55:15.356
and develop a personality of that compassion and love and everything.

00:55:17.205 --> 00:55:21.988
Then only you’ll be amazed.

00:55:23.197 --> 00:55:26.295
You’ll grow into something really,

00:55:27.252 --> 00:55:33.332
a beautiful picture of perfection as a human being.

00:55:36.613 --> 00:55:39.324
So may God bless you.
