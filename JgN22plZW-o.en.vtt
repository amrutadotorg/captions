00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:15.563
I’ll talk before and then at the time you
can just tell me what time it is.

00:00:15.764 --> 00:00:22.542
The radio is off? You can keep it till
eight o’clock and…

00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:45.940
So happy to wait on you.

00:00:52.758 --> 00:00:58.936
Today we are celebrating a day

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:06.678
which is a very, very important,

00:01:06.894 --> 00:01:12.588
absolutely the most important, we can say,
day,

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:19.346
when such a great happening took
place.

00:01:20.417 --> 00:01:25.161
And it had to take place that way –

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.090
it was all in a way destined.

00:01:41.211 --> 00:01:45.809
In my last lectures I have told you

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:54.734
how Christ was created first
in the heavens.

00:01:56.389 --> 00:02:05.980
In the Devi Mahatmya, if you read that,
He was created as Mahavishnu

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:16.280
and is mentioned very clearly, that first
He was created as an egg.

00:02:16.604 --> 00:02:23.784
It is written in this book, which perhaps
was written about 14,000 years back.

00:02:24.496 --> 00:02:29.059
It’s a book that predicts about Christ,

00:02:30.365 --> 00:02:35.247
and that is why people in the West,
specially,

00:02:35.448 --> 00:02:38.964
offer an egg to each other as a friend.

00:02:39.165 --> 00:02:45.256
The first existence came on this Earth
as an egg, that was Christ,

00:02:45.457 --> 00:03:00.056
and part of it was kept in that state
and the rest of it was used

00:03:01.062 --> 00:03:10.502
by the Holy Ghost, by Mahalakshmi,
to create Christ out of it.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.306
In that ancient book He was called
as Mahavishnu;

00:03:16.507 --> 00:03:19.626
means the greater form of Vishnu.

00:03:19.827 --> 00:03:22.860
But actually Vishnu is the father

00:03:23.061 --> 00:03:28.923
and He is the Son created by the Holy
Ghost.

00:03:29.124 --> 00:03:33.880
After my lecture I would like, if you have
the book, to read it out to them,

00:03:34.081 --> 00:03:39.023
the whole texts of how Christ was created.

00:03:40.062 --> 00:03:48.806
And when He was created, He cried
for His Father,

00:03:50.466 --> 00:03:54.362
as He cried also on the cross once.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:01.047
And He cried for years.

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:09.187
And then Christ, in Mahavishnu state
was blessed by His Father

00:04:09.388 --> 00:04:14.407
who said that, “Your position will be
placed higher than Mine.

00:04:14.608 --> 00:04:18.420
And You will be the Adhara,” means
the ‘Support of the Universe’.

00:04:18.621 --> 00:04:24.166
See, how from Mooladhara He becomes
the Adhara.

00:04:27.495 --> 00:04:32.566
This was all done at the heavenly stage -

00:04:32.775 --> 00:04:36.531
Vaikuntha stage you can say.

00:04:37.323 --> 00:04:43.272
Then He was given birth by the Holy Ghost,

00:04:43.473 --> 00:04:48.443
who was the mother of Christ on this
Earth,

00:04:48.644 --> 00:04:54.936
who was nobody else but was the incarnation
of Mahalakshmi; means She was Radha.

00:04:55.137 --> 00:05:01.420
Ra-dha. ‘Ra’ means energy, ‘dha’ means
the one who sustains the energy.

00:05:06.107 --> 00:05:11.272
There are many aspects of Easter one
has to understand,

00:05:12.536 --> 00:05:18.920
but the most of all is why did He die and
why was He resurrected?

00:05:19.121 --> 00:05:24.189
This point I have not yet touched, perhaps,
so clearly.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.663
That’s the point I want to tell you today.

00:05:27.864 --> 00:05:32.273
It’s only you people can understand
the importance of the life of Christ.

00:05:32.474 --> 00:05:41.206
And when it is said that you have to get
your realisation through Christ,

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:46.734
it means that He had to pierce through
the Agnya chakra.

00:05:46.972 --> 00:05:52.351
He had to be there. If He had not created

00:05:52.552 --> 00:05:58.169
this gap in the gate, we could never have
got realisation.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:04.956
That is why it is said that you are to pass
through

00:06:05.157 --> 00:06:14.254
the gates of heaven only with the grace
of Christ.

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:17.482
Of course, that doesn’t mean churches,
it doesn’t mean at all churches.

00:06:17.683 --> 00:06:21.091
That you understand as sahaja yogis that
you have to pass through the Agnya chakra.

00:06:21.292 --> 00:06:26.340
Ultimately that’s the most difficult point
where human beings have to pass.

00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:34.326
Because, at the Agnya chakra, your ego
and superego are fully grown.

00:06:34.527 --> 00:06:38.786
At the human stage only this ego
is developed.

00:06:38.987 --> 00:06:43.368
Now how to overcome the ego was a point.

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:50.574
And to overcome the ego, Christ had
to do this.

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:57.837
When He was created in the beginning
as Shri Ganesha -

00:06:58.837 --> 00:07:07.396
you know the story how He was created,
that the mala,

00:07:07.597 --> 00:07:18.008
is the - from the body of Parvati, the Holy
Ghost, was taken out,

00:07:18.209 --> 00:07:24.816
because before Her marriage, She was -

00:07:25.017 --> 00:07:32.521
She had to cover Herself for Her bath
with many scented things.

00:07:32.722 --> 00:07:37.726
And it was taken out, all these things,
and Her vibrations came out.

00:07:37.927 --> 00:07:41.748
And She created this child just to protect
Her chastity;

00:07:41.949 --> 00:07:47.664
outside Her bathroom She put him. And
you know the whole story about it.

00:07:47.865 --> 00:07:53.725
Now there was a part of the element
of the earth in that child.

00:07:53.926 --> 00:07:57.595
Pruthvi-tattwa, was there.

00:07:57.796 --> 00:08:09.458
All other centres - all other centres have
got some elements in them.

00:08:09.659 --> 00:08:15.291
Some elements like pruthvi-tattwa is there,
earth element;

00:08:15.492 --> 00:08:20.335
then you have got water element, then
you have got air element,

00:08:20.536 --> 00:08:29.696
and when you come to this it is the light
element, it’s the light.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:36.051
And at this point, at Agnya chakra,

00:08:36.357 --> 00:08:42.160
He had to cross the last element, that
was the light element.

00:08:42.361 --> 00:08:46.424
That means He had to come out into
the true form

00:08:46.625 --> 00:08:55.204
of only the Divine Power, the Omkara,
the vibrations you can call it;

00:08:55.405 --> 00:09:03.237
or the absolute -

00:09:03.438 --> 00:09:08.227
you call it logos or something like that?
The first sound, Brahma.

00:09:08.428 --> 00:09:11.739
So He had to become the principle
of Brahma.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.662
To become the principle of Brahma,

00:09:13.863 --> 00:09:18.706
He had to get rid of all other elements
within Him.

00:09:18.907 --> 00:09:25.124
So the last was also the light element,
which He had to cross through.

00:09:25.325 --> 00:09:30.359
So He had earth element in Him, as He
was of the mala,

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:35.534
and all other elements within Him.
But when it comes to the Agnya,

00:09:35.735 --> 00:09:39.392
He had to give up all the elements,
that He had to die

00:09:39.593 --> 00:09:42.375
the death of all these elements that were
within Him,

00:09:42.576 --> 00:09:47.819
to become complete, absolutely pure
Spirit.

00:09:50.391 --> 00:09:56.081
What He did on subtle form works out
on the gross form,

00:09:57.174 --> 00:10:04.850
and to do that He had to die. And
whatever died in Him,

00:10:05.051 --> 00:10:08.221
was that little element of earth element
and other elements,

00:10:08.422 --> 00:10:13.063
and what came out of Him was pure Spirit.

00:10:13.264 --> 00:10:16.123
[To somebody: “Just move forward.”]

00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:21.265
Was pure Spirit that was resurrected;
the pure Spirit,

00:10:21.466 --> 00:10:28.543
the pure Brahma-Tattwa which had formed
the body of Christ,

00:10:28.744 --> 00:10:32.922
which was the body of Christ.

00:10:35.705 --> 00:10:39.738
And this happening came -

00:10:39.939 --> 00:10:47.247
Christ has done what was predicted
about Him -

00:10:47.747 --> 00:10:54.506
that He is the saviour, because He passed
through that gate

00:10:54.707 --> 00:10:59.872
to take people from this bodily existence,

00:11:00.073 --> 00:11:06.289
means the one that depends on the elements,

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:10.094
to that existence which is Spirit.

00:11:10.295 --> 00:11:17.586
So the resurrection is where you become,
from your attention,

00:11:17.787 --> 00:11:22.393
you jump into the attention of the Spirit.

00:11:22.594 --> 00:11:29.916
When you feel your attention, when you
become the Spirit.

00:11:30.117 --> 00:11:38.322
That is the happening which has happened
to you also.

00:11:38.523 --> 00:11:45.155
But He became pure Spirit, pure Brahma
Tattwa when He was resurrected.

00:11:45.356 --> 00:11:54.729
And the resurrection is a happening
of the Divine Power

00:11:54.930 --> 00:12:04.413
which came from Mooladhara chakra as just
earth element, started growing.

00:12:04.614 --> 00:12:08.854
It took its birth from there, came up
to Agnya chakra.

00:12:09.055 --> 00:12:17.250
There Christ was created to pass through
all the elements,

00:12:17.451 --> 00:12:22.660
ultimately to enter into the Sahasrara

00:12:22.861 --> 00:12:28.321
to become a complete Brahma Tattwa.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:39.999
And this was a very difficult thing,
was very experimental.

00:12:40.208 --> 00:12:45.849
And the experiment was quite a dangerous
one.

00:12:47.391 --> 00:12:54.085
It could have failed also, because He had
in Him

00:12:54.317 --> 00:13:01.682
that human element, the body element
which suffered.

00:13:03.009 --> 00:13:09.118
And He suffered, because this body element
suffers, not the Spirit;

00:13:09.319 --> 00:13:13.154
Spirit does not suffer. The body element
suffers.

00:13:13.363 --> 00:13:23.532
So He had to suffer that body element
and to get over it, to get out of it.

00:13:25.339 --> 00:13:36.950
And to get out of it He had to have
a tremendous courage.

00:13:38.071 --> 00:13:43.378
It was such a difficult operation.

00:13:44.132 --> 00:13:47.706
Without Him nobody could have achieved.

00:13:47.907 --> 00:13:50.931
He knew it was predestined,

00:13:51.132 --> 00:13:58.765
but it was one of the most difficult things
to happen.

00:13:58.966 --> 00:14:05.002
I wonder how many Christians know
the significance of an egg.

00:14:05.203 --> 00:14:13.471
Now egg signifies a stage where you are
before realisation,

00:14:13.672 --> 00:14:20.987
when you are in your eggshell; that you
are Mr. X, you are Mrs. Y, all that.

00:14:21.188 --> 00:14:25.367
But when you mature fully inside,

00:14:25.568 --> 00:14:30.781
the bird is ready and that is the time
you are hatched.

00:14:30.982 --> 00:14:34.541
This is the time you get twice born.

00:14:34.742 --> 00:14:39.372
So, actually the resurrection of Christ
signifies that,

00:14:39.573 --> 00:14:45.276
and that’s why we give that egg to people
saying,

00:14:45.477 --> 00:14:52.202
“You are an egg”, a reminder of that, and
this egg can become the Spirit.

00:14:52.403 --> 00:14:56.700
And also it is written that it was an egg
when He came.

00:14:56.901 --> 00:15:03.993
First He was created as an egg. Half of it
remained as Shri Ganesha

00:15:04.194 --> 00:15:08.368
and half of it became Mahavishnu.

00:15:08.569 --> 00:15:14.429
Then He came on this earth and He departed
with all His elements

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:19.272
and the pure vibrations formed His body,

00:15:19.473 --> 00:15:27.534
and He remained there within all of you,
to be awakened.

00:15:27.735 --> 00:15:35.591
And when the Kundalini takes your attention
through that point,

00:15:35.792 --> 00:15:40.265
there you also become the Spirit.

00:15:40.589 --> 00:15:45.372
That’s why He said that, “I’m the gate,
I’m the door.”

00:15:45.573 --> 00:15:50.309
He didn’t say, “I’m the destination.”
He said, “I’m the door,”

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:54.069
because you cannot become Christ.

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:57.866
That’s why he didn’t say, “I’m the
destination,” that you have to achieve Him.

00:15:58.067 --> 00:16:03.499
But He has created this space for you.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:11.890
You can become spiritually awakened;
you can become your Spirit.

00:16:12.099 --> 00:16:17.617
But Christ is an incarnation, He was
the Son of God.

00:16:17.818 --> 00:16:23.380
And so He is an incarnation, and that
incarnation came on this earth

00:16:23.581 --> 00:16:32.378
just to pull you out of your elements,
to make you become the Spirit.

00:16:32.604 --> 00:16:39.284
Now how is it that it was the most
difficult thing?

00:16:39.485 --> 00:16:47.085
Because human beings have created in their
heads all kinds of artificial barriers.

00:16:47.286 --> 00:16:50.760
You see, whatever we think and whatever
we do with our mind

00:16:50.961 --> 00:16:54.769
is all dead, is man-made, is artificial.

00:16:54.970 --> 00:17:00.457
Because reality is beyond your mind;
it is not in your mind.

00:17:00.658 --> 00:17:03.151
You cannot conceive it; you cannot hold it.

00:17:03.352 --> 00:17:08.704
Whatever is in your mind is not
the reality, it is beyond.

00:17:08.905 --> 00:17:14.853
So, for a human being to accept something
that is beyond mind

00:17:15.054 --> 00:17:17.328
had become so difficult at the time
of Christ,

00:17:17.529 --> 00:17:19.994
because of Romans and all these people
coming up.

00:17:20.195 --> 00:17:23.770
And we are repeating the history again.

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:27.574
They were so ego-oriented, they were
so full of ego

00:17:27.775 --> 00:17:37.246
that to destroy their ego somebody had
to do this to create a passage.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.677
By His death so many things are proved,
that all those who crucified Him

00:17:43.878 --> 00:17:47.707
were stupid people, they were ego-oriented,
they were blind.

00:17:47.908 --> 00:17:51.154
They could not see what He was.

00:17:51.355 --> 00:17:56.920
They could not see what a genuine
personality He was.

00:17:57.121 --> 00:18:00.960
They crucified Him.

00:18:03.183 --> 00:18:07.847
I mean, it’s the greatest stupidity. And
they crucified Him,

00:18:08.048 --> 00:18:11.438
it was all known because these people
were so stupid

00:18:11.639 --> 00:18:15.014
that they would have only crucified Him,
what else they could do?

00:18:15.238 --> 00:18:19.691
Because they couldn’t bear, with their
little egos, somebody who is so simple,

00:18:19.892 --> 00:18:23.029
who is so genuine, who is so true.

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:32.015
So they crucified Him and that crucifixion
came as a breakthrough for us.

00:18:32.216 --> 00:18:36.257
But message for us is the resurrection
part.

00:18:36.458 --> 00:18:41.492
Message for us is the resurrection, and
not crucifixion.

00:18:41.693 --> 00:18:45.561
Crucifixion is not the message, because
He’s done it for us.

00:18:45.762 --> 00:18:51.539
This is the point where Jews must
understand.

00:18:52.284 --> 00:18:55.842
The other day I was reading - today only -

00:18:56.043 --> 00:19:04.104
some discussion with the Archbishop
of Canterbury took place.

00:19:04.305 --> 00:19:08.752
And the fellow who was asking him was
asking him questions

00:19:08.953 --> 00:19:13.682
as if he was asking questions to God.

00:19:14.616 --> 00:19:18.780
In a way he said so also that, “I would
ask this question to God,

00:19:18.981 --> 00:19:22.401
that, why is it so many Jews were killed?”

00:19:22.602 --> 00:19:25.317
They asked for it.

00:19:25.518 --> 00:19:29.751
They wanted that they must suffer

00:19:29.952 --> 00:19:33.366
because they wouldn’t give the credit
of suffering to Christ.

00:19:33.567 --> 00:19:37.061
They thought, “We all have to suffer.”
Ego. It’s ego.

00:19:37.262 --> 00:19:42.409
“How dare anybody suffer for us? We must
suffer separately.”

00:19:43.259 --> 00:19:44.710
They couldn’t give that credit to Christ

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:52.981
and all the later thinking was that,
“We must suffer.”

00:19:53.182 --> 00:20:01.261
So, whatever you think, comes into action
on this gross level,

00:20:01.462 --> 00:20:06.753
so Mr. Hitler was born and he made them
suffer.

00:20:10.427 --> 00:20:18.285
And the stupidity of human beings
is responsible

00:20:18.486 --> 00:20:23.481
for all the problems that are created
on this earth.

00:20:23.682 --> 00:20:26.430
The other question was, “How the children
get leukemia?”

00:20:26.631 --> 00:20:28.423
He would ask God, “How children get it?”

00:20:28.624 --> 00:20:34.330
If the parents are so frantic and speedy,
children have to get it.

00:20:35.459 --> 00:20:40.192
If you are not relaxed person when you
are married

00:20:40.393 --> 00:20:44.020
and when you are going to have a baby,
you are thinking of divorces

00:20:44.221 --> 00:20:48.271
and all sorts of nonsense, that franticness
will work on the child.

00:20:48.472 --> 00:20:51.569
Psychologically it is a left-side problem,
and the child has to be

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:59.370
a patient of leukemia as soon as he is
born. That is what it is.

00:21:03.384 --> 00:21:10.992
So the problems are created by human beings
because of their stupidity.

00:21:11.193 --> 00:21:13.988
There is no problem that God has created
for you.

00:21:14.189 --> 00:21:17.627
He’s solved all your problems. All your
problems He solves;

00:21:17.828 --> 00:21:21.773
you have seen in Sahaj Yoga how He solves
your little, little problems even.

00:21:21.974 --> 00:21:27.750
But we create problems for ourselves
by our stupidity,

00:21:27.951 --> 00:21:38.039
by our addiction to elements, to material
things,

00:21:38.494 --> 00:21:43.466
to material habits. Matter sits on our
head.

00:21:47.272 --> 00:21:58.084
That is on the, we can say, on the level
of the earth element.

00:21:59.363 --> 00:22:04.437
Then we have other problems like
emotional attachments:

00:22:04.638 --> 00:22:07.992
“This is my daughter; this is my child;
this is my; this is mine;

00:22:08.193 --> 00:22:11.867
I’m so attached to my child.”

00:22:14.825 --> 00:22:19.349
Then, “This is my country. This is your
country.”

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:23.330
We create problem. This Falkland camp...
Falkland this thing

00:22:23.531 --> 00:22:26.914
is an artificial problem, you can see
that.

00:22:27.115 --> 00:22:30.147
I mean, when these people went there,
these Spaniards,

00:22:30.348 --> 00:22:32.961
they all should be driven back to Spain.

00:22:33.162 --> 00:22:37.902
And all from Brazil should be driven back
to Portugal.

00:22:38.103 --> 00:22:42.510
What are they doing there if this is
the situation?

00:22:42.711 --> 00:22:46.531
But they are all human beings! What is
this territory business?

00:22:46.732 --> 00:22:50.161
So let human beings live happily wherever
they are.

00:22:50.362 --> 00:22:53.053
What are they going to get out of this
territory?

00:22:53.254 --> 00:22:57.558
God never created Argentina, Chile, England
and all that,

00:22:57.759 --> 00:23:03.461
He created one homogeneous structure,
and it is to look after each other.

00:23:03.662 --> 00:23:06.448
Like a heart is created, a liver is
created,

00:23:06.649 --> 00:23:09.689
a brain is created, a nose is created.

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:14.758
If they start fighting - say this eye
starts fighting this eye.

00:23:14.959 --> 00:23:20.324
We laugh, but we human beings do the same
thing.

00:23:21.147 --> 00:23:23.616
We are all the time doing like this.

00:23:23.817 --> 00:23:29.885
This is the stupidity of human beings,
which is creating problem.

00:23:30.086 --> 00:23:33.071
And when you become very stupid,
somebody horrible

00:23:33.272 --> 00:23:36.176
takes advantage of that and comes
on this earth

00:23:36.377 --> 00:23:43.070
just like Hitler, and he tries to put you
right.

00:23:43.648 --> 00:23:49.993
You don’t need all that. You need only
wisdom and your realisation.

00:23:50.194 --> 00:23:54.025
And that is what is done today that you
have got realisation.

00:23:54.226 --> 00:24:00.870
So Easter for sahaj yogis all over
the world, is the most important happening,

00:24:01.071 --> 00:24:04.878
because if it had not happened it would
not have been possible

00:24:05.079 --> 00:24:08.395
to give realisation to people.

00:24:12.409 --> 00:24:14.766
I think Gavin will read it out to you
later on

00:24:14.967 --> 00:24:18.444
about what is written about Christ in Devi
Mahatmya.

00:24:18.645 --> 00:24:23.331
This book was written about 14,000 years
back by Markandeya.

00:24:23.532 --> 00:24:29.012
So imagine, 14,000 years back he knew,
being a seer, just like Blake,

00:24:29.213 --> 00:24:33.825
what was going to happen when Christ
was to come.

00:24:34.026 --> 00:24:36.638
But He was called as Mahavishnu. He was
not Vishnu,

00:24:36.839 --> 00:24:40.025
He was the son of Vishnu.

00:24:43.355 --> 00:24:51.234
And how many Christians understand about
Easter? They don’t.

00:24:51.435 --> 00:24:54.612
They - it’s - Christianity today is nothing
but a mental activity,

00:24:54.813 --> 00:24:57.255
that’s all, which is dead; nonsense it is.

00:24:57.456 --> 00:24:59.821
Just like any other nonsensical religion,
it has become

00:25:00.022 --> 00:25:04.340
another foolish, stupid religion, which has
no meaning.

00:25:04.541 --> 00:25:08.361
Unless and until you get your realisation,
unless and until you feel the vibrations,

00:25:08.562 --> 00:25:13.232
unless and until you feel this Divine
Surrounding Power, how will you understand?

00:25:13.433 --> 00:25:15.409
Because that’s the only thing that is
truth;

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:18.380
that’s the only thing that is reality,

00:25:18.581 --> 00:25:22.972
and unless and until you achieve it, how
will you know about Christ?

00:25:23.173 --> 00:25:27.421
And fighting about Him; how can you fight?
I can’t understand really.

00:25:27.622 --> 00:25:33.152
To me, it’s stupidity gone to another
extreme.

00:25:33.691 --> 00:25:37.439
By this thing, what you do actually,
is to use

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:42.389
all these great incarnations to kill each
other. Can you imagine?

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:46.972
The things that came to elevate you,
to make you into higher living

00:25:47.173 --> 00:25:50.742
are now used, the same things, the names
are used

00:25:50.943 --> 00:25:53.679
to kill each other, to bring down each
other.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:57.204
At the most, if you reach a point where
you don’t understand,

00:25:57.405 --> 00:26:01.122
then they start saying, “It’s a mystery.”

00:26:01.323 --> 00:26:04.563
What is the mystery? In Sahaj Yoga
there’s no mystery.

00:26:04.764 --> 00:26:08.986
It’s all just there.

00:26:09.435 --> 00:26:13.672
To me, human beings are a mystery.

00:26:13.873 --> 00:26:18.704
I don’t understand them. I can’t
understand.

00:26:18.905 --> 00:26:25.427
The resurrection of Christ has to now be
collective resurrection.

00:26:25.628 --> 00:26:33.109
This is what is Maha Yoga. Has to be
the collective resurrection

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:35.589
and for this collective resurrection,

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:40.283
first of all sahaj yogis must decide to be
collective.

00:26:40.484 --> 00:26:47.234
Because through Kundalini awakening,
you cross, no doubt, you cross through,

00:26:47.435 --> 00:26:52.717
but you enter an area of collectivity.

00:26:52.918 --> 00:26:58.453
And if you do not allow that collectivity
to permeate into you,

00:26:58.654 --> 00:27:01.178
then you come down.

00:27:01.379 --> 00:27:07.082
Supposing you become a state beyond
the element,

00:27:07.283 --> 00:27:10.641
the state where you are a collective being;

00:27:10.842 --> 00:27:13.366
you are aware of the collective being;

00:27:13.567 --> 00:27:16.924
you are aware that you are a part and
parcel of the whole;

00:27:17.125 --> 00:27:21.654
you are aware that you have to help
your nose and your eyes

00:27:21.855 --> 00:27:24.187
because you are part and parcel
of the whole.

00:27:24.388 --> 00:27:27.112
You reach that stage where you understand
that,

00:27:27.313 --> 00:27:32.216
“I am as important as other cells are, and
other cells are to be helped by me

00:27:32.417 --> 00:27:36.613
and they have to sustain me, we are one.”
There should be complete concord.

00:27:36.814 --> 00:27:42.587
This awareness comes after realisation,
and if you do not understand

00:27:42.788 --> 00:27:47.419
that this awareness, that this collective
awareness

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:53.417
is the only way you can stay in that area.
Otherwise you get out.

00:27:53.618 --> 00:28:03.743
You start having your smaller wells and
you just go down into them.

00:28:04.724 --> 00:28:09.481
The more you start to expand yourself,
you rise higher

00:28:09.698 --> 00:28:14.501
and then you are again with your badhas
or whatever it is.

00:28:14.702 --> 00:28:19.150
But if you think that, “I have to live
for the whole.

00:28:19.351 --> 00:28:26.181
I’m responsible for the whole. I’m
responsible for creating

00:28:26.577 --> 00:28:32.529
a nucleus of a cell which is going to look
after the whole,

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:35.557
and if I fall down the rest also suffers.

00:28:35.758 --> 00:28:40.982
I have no business to fall down because
I have been resurrected to this point.

00:28:41.183 --> 00:28:46.751
I have entered into the state of
collectivity, where my being,

00:28:46.952 --> 00:28:50.300
which is the Spirit, is the collective
being

00:28:50.501 --> 00:28:53.543
and I have to stay there, I have to be
there;

00:28:53.744 --> 00:28:58.219
I cannot fall, it’s not the way I can
live.”

00:28:58.443 --> 00:29:03.522
But I have seen after realisation also,
people cannot get out of their shells.

00:29:03.723 --> 00:29:08.758
They still remain in the shell. They cannot
spread their wings

00:29:08.959 --> 00:29:16.531
and sing, and get out of their shell and
just fly.

00:29:16.732 --> 00:29:21.764
They cannot do it. They still stick on to
their small ways of life,

00:29:21.965 --> 00:29:24.780
in a smaller ways, in every way.

00:29:24.981 --> 00:29:29.590
In a holiday you go, you want to have
a separate holiday. Why?

00:29:29.791 --> 00:29:33.200
This is the holiday time, holy-day as they
say.

00:29:33.401 --> 00:29:38.132
Holy day. This is the holy-day. When you
are with other sahaja yogis

00:29:38.333 --> 00:29:42.827
you are really enjoying the holiday. Where
do you enjoy a holiday otherwise?

00:29:43.028 --> 00:29:48.623
Which is the other way? To be with them
is the real holiday.

00:29:49.107 --> 00:29:54.953
And that is why one should understand that
you should expand your collectivity.

00:29:55.154 --> 00:29:58.474
If you do not expand your collectivity
you are just a waste.

00:29:58.675 --> 00:30:02.931
You are a wasteful creation of sahaj yogis,

00:30:03.132 --> 00:30:06.918
which I’m sorry to say, will go down.

00:30:07.119 --> 00:30:09.189
Such people show also, in the beginning,

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:13.691
gradually they start getting better and
better and better.

00:30:13.892 --> 00:30:16.518
And once you are there in full state,
you really enjoy each

00:30:16.719 --> 00:30:19.191
other’s company without having any fears
about them,

00:30:19.392 --> 00:30:21.629
without having any possessiveness about
them,

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:28.446
without having any kind of expectation,
but just enjoying each other.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:34.546
That has to happen. Like all our cells
in our body are like that.

00:30:34.747 --> 00:30:42.381
If they can do it, why not we? Because
we have so much of sense;

00:30:42.582 --> 00:30:46.241
at least we think we have more sense
than the cells have.

00:30:46.442 --> 00:30:49.206
At least it is expected, because we have
evolved so much

00:30:49.407 --> 00:30:52.019
from a unicell to this state.

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:56.603
And then you are the epitome of God’s
creation;

00:30:56.804 --> 00:31:00.249
you are the topmost people. Then why not?

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:03.547
When you are resurrected, the first thing
that should happen to you

00:31:03.748 --> 00:31:07.304
is to understand that you are no more
an individual,

00:31:07.505 --> 00:31:11.634
but you are a collective being. You are
no more an individual.

00:31:11.857 --> 00:31:21.223
All things which make you circumcise
your individuality - throw that away.

00:31:21.952 --> 00:31:25.240
You are no more an individual. All problems
which come to you

00:31:25.441 --> 00:31:34.340
as individual problems are absolutely
useless, false, wasteful.

00:31:34.541 --> 00:31:39.465
Think of the collective problems. I enjoy
such people.

00:31:39.666 --> 00:31:44.964
Like the other day Fergie was anxious
to know about Bristol -

00:31:45.165 --> 00:31:50.413
which points are there, which are giving
vibrations from the Mother Earth.

00:31:50.614 --> 00:31:53.759
He’s worried about the whole of Bristol -
all the Jamaicans,

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:59.288
then about the whole Britain - British
people,

00:31:59.489 --> 00:32:03.283
and then of the whole world you should be.
That’s what one should think.

00:32:03.484 --> 00:32:06.731
One should not think, “How will my daughter
get married?

00:32:06.932 --> 00:32:09.084
How can I get a ticket to go there?”

00:32:09.285 --> 00:32:11.656
All these nonsensical ideas should be
given up

00:32:11.857 --> 00:32:14.955
because you are now entered into
the Kingdom of God

00:32:15.156 --> 00:32:18.222
and He is going to look after you.

00:32:18.452 --> 00:32:23.170
Because that state you establish within
yourself that you are a collective being.

00:32:23.371 --> 00:32:26.927
All other things will drop out. Gradually
everybody will be molded.

00:32:27.128 --> 00:32:32.067
Even the most difficult I have seen,
have improved.

00:32:32.268 --> 00:32:35.469
But what about you, the one who is
improving everybody else,

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:38.472
what about you? How far you are there?

00:32:38.673 --> 00:32:41.714
How far in your faith that you know that,

00:32:41.915 --> 00:32:44.995
“I have entered into the Kingdom of God

00:32:45.196 --> 00:32:49.798
and that every action mine is looked
after and guided

00:32:49.999 --> 00:32:52.556
by His power and I’m aware of it.

00:32:52.757 --> 00:32:56.587
I’m aware that I have entered into
the Kingdom of God

00:32:56.788 --> 00:32:59.624
which is expressed through my
collectivity.”

00:32:59.825 --> 00:33:04.938
So collectivity is the nature
of a sahaj yogi.

00:33:05.922 --> 00:33:09.068
And that’s what one has to realise.

00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:12.297
May God bless you all.

00:33:12.604 --> 00:33:17.477
Is it all right now? Just time.

00:33:20.885 --> 00:33:25.881
How I manage it, without looking
at the watch?

00:33:59.586 --> 00:34:02.920
Come forward. There’s some people standing.

00:34:03.121 --> 00:34:07.766
Come forward. I’ll have some water.

00:34:08.227 --> 00:34:11.191
First some tea.

00:34:31.126 --> 00:34:37.973
I mean, all these lectures if you could
tape [Hallo, Athena, hallo!] –

00:34:38.953 --> 00:34:44.086
if you could tape all these and sort of
send some of them to France and –

00:34:44.287 --> 00:34:48.356
or from Lille they have come both of them –

00:34:48.557 --> 00:34:55.283
and I think it should work out.

00:34:55.483 --> 00:34:58.770
Because first the people come in, then
they disappear.

00:34:58.971 --> 00:35:05.002
As usual, that’s the common feature,
you see. Then gradually they…

00:35:06.293 --> 00:35:09.054
Yogi: Mother?
Shri Mataji: It’s lovely.

00:35:09.255 --> 00:35:11.899
Yogi: If someone makes a list of Your
lectures,

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:16.049
what You’ve been speaking about, as it
was along which we got one,

00:35:16.272 --> 00:35:18.679
we can print a list each month
on a newsletter,

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.333
so the people in other centres can write
and ask for tapes in writing,

00:35:21.534 --> 00:35:23.529
ask which wants…
Shri Mataji: That’s a good thing.

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:28.022
You must every time I speak you will give
it a heading.

00:35:28.223 --> 00:35:32.637
All that we should. What is it?

00:35:32.838 --> 00:35:34.698
Is it coming?
Yogi: The radio programme.

00:35:34.898 --> 00:35:38.260
Shri Mataji: Ah, is it coming?

00:35:40.365 --> 00:35:43.344
It’s still time.

00:35:44.006 --> 00:35:47.572
Yes, that is important. I agree

00:35:47.773 --> 00:35:52.565
that we must have a list of things where…

00:35:52.766 --> 00:35:55.267
You have to give it a title - you see,
I have no titles,

00:35:55.468 --> 00:35:59.406
but you have to give a title. For example
what you can say

00:35:59.607 --> 00:36:07.483
is the Resurrection of Christ, or something
about Easter.

00:36:14.714 --> 00:36:18.410
Actually you can contact this Bishop
of Canterbury.

00:36:18.611 --> 00:36:27.457
This - you know... Poor man, he is not such
a staunch Christian, I feel, the way…

00:36:29.438 --> 00:36:32.353
I think next time you may write a letter
to him,

00:36:32.554 --> 00:36:35.341
and some of you can go and see him.

00:36:35.542 --> 00:36:38.617
And Gregoire comes, and three-four people
you should ask for a thing.

00:36:38.817 --> 00:36:42.828
And you should say - today’s, can you get
today’s Times?

00:36:43.029 --> 00:36:45.067
Or if you can telephone to my servant,

00:36:45.268 --> 00:36:49.432
tell him not to throw today’s newspaper,
he’s a good thrower

00:36:49.633 --> 00:36:52.328
Very good at throwing. Can somebody
telephone to him?

00:36:52.528 --> 00:36:57.673
Is a phone here available? John?

00:36:57.873 --> 00:37:01.711
Yogi: He used to be in the cathedral
of Saint-Albans. Shri Mataji: Eh?

00:37:01.911 --> 00:37:04.624
Yogi: He used to be in the cathedral
of Saint-Albans. You know?

00:37:04.825 --> 00:37:07.740
He was there when You were there.
Gavin: When You were in St. Albans,

00:37:07.941 --> 00:37:10.807
when Djamel was living at St. Alban,
You visited there,

00:37:11.007 --> 00:37:13.382
he was the bishop there. That time.
Yogi: He was the bishop there.

00:37:13.582 --> 00:37:16.695
Shri Mataji: How was he?
Yogi: I didn’t know him at that time,

00:37:16.896 --> 00:37:20.573
but soon after You visited, he got
promoted.

00:37:20.774 --> 00:37:24.776
Shri Mataji: Really? Good idea!

00:37:24.977 --> 00:37:29.659
So we can write to him. [Yogi: Yes] I might
have met him there also, possibly.

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:35.090
Might have seen him.
[Yogi: “It’s quite possible, yes”]

00:38:06.294 --> 00:38:12.982
Gavin, you have to collect my passport
tomorrow. All right?

00:38:13.183 --> 00:38:18.695
Then I would say, on 5th of May,

00:38:18.896 --> 00:38:22.965
if you people could collect some money
for this building.

00:38:23.166 --> 00:38:27.863
That’s a good day, when you can give it
to me, or to Gregoire [Yogi: Yes],

00:38:28.064 --> 00:38:32.227
and we can put that money in the bank,
we have opened now an account for that.

00:38:32.428 --> 00:38:36.368
Any amount that people want to give,
and the first amount –

00:38:36.583 --> 00:38:40.264
and also Lille people wanted to give
some money.

00:38:40.465 --> 00:38:43.795
I told them that’s for our, you should
give it for our building account,

00:38:43.995 --> 00:38:48.322
because we have to have a building now,
it’s absolutely eminent.

00:38:48.523 --> 00:38:52.350
Before I go back, you could have money

00:38:52.551 --> 00:39:01.091
for which you can also tell Warren

00:39:01.292 --> 00:39:03.957
that this is what is decided.

00:39:04.158 --> 00:39:09.503
Then the first amount should go on the 5th,
would be a good idea.

00:39:09.704 --> 00:39:15.651
And I’ve got the account number also,
so you can send it

00:39:15.852 --> 00:39:20.377
in the name of Gregoire, and the account
number I’ll give it to you.

00:39:20.578 --> 00:39:26.562
If you want, it should be all right.

00:39:26.769 --> 00:39:31.104
Gavin: May I ask You to find out how many
people are about to go to Paris from here?

00:39:31.304 --> 00:39:35.511
Shri Mataji: Now. Now, for Paris, the thing
is, it is on Tuesday,

00:39:35.712 --> 00:39:38.991
the programme is on Tuesday.

00:39:39.905 --> 00:39:46.119
And she has arranged that we go to Lille
on Sunday.

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:51.551
So if you come to Lille on Sunday,

00:39:51.761 --> 00:40:00.426
after the programme, if you want, you all
can go to Paris,

00:40:00.638 --> 00:40:08.126
and stay in the ashram there. Or is it
possible in Lille?

00:40:09.863 --> 00:40:13.824
Is there any place where we can take it
on rent for a night somewhere?

00:40:14.025 --> 00:40:16.442
Yogi: No problem, Mother.
Shri Mataji: What is it?

00:40:16.643 --> 00:40:19.170
Yogi: No problem.
Shri Mataji: No problem? Sure?

00:40:19.371 --> 00:40:22.358
Yogi: There’s definitely place.

00:40:22.605 --> 00:40:26.670
Shri Mataji: All right, so one night you
can stay in Lille. Will be good idea.

00:40:26.871 --> 00:40:29.947
Yogi: If there are enough people we could
also take a bus. Shri Mataji: Hm?

00:40:30.148 --> 00:40:32.340
Yogi: We could take a bus to travel.
Shri Mataji: Good.

00:40:32.541 --> 00:40:36.893
Yogi: If there are enough people, we just
have to find out how many want to get there.

00:40:37.094 --> 00:40:41.009
Shri Mataji: Now, from Lille then we go
to Paris.

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:44.560
In Paris you have a big place to the…

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:51.541
that will be the Monday, Tuesday,

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:58.813
and Wednesday we have this Puja,
in the morning time perhaps,

00:41:00.108 --> 00:41:03.579
and I would like to come back if possible
on the 6th.

00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:08.943
If 5th is all right, all right, otherwise
6th you can put it.

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:19.751
Somebody is working it out in Brussels!

00:41:19.952 --> 00:41:23.153
Did you write to that doctor? [Yogi:
“Yes, Mother…”] Good.

00:41:23.354 --> 00:41:26.762
Have you kept his address? [Yogi: Yes…]

00:41:31.271 --> 00:41:34.484
I think on Gavin I put too much pressure
also sometimes.

00:41:34.685 --> 00:41:39.560
Somebody must try to share that also.
And you should find out.

00:41:39.761 --> 00:41:44.280
It’s easy to telephone to him, I know his
number very well.

00:41:44.481 --> 00:41:47.833
But you can find out, all of you, if he
needs any help.

00:41:48.034 --> 00:41:51.328
Magda, sometimes you can telephone
to him [Magda: “Yes, Shri Mataji”],

00:41:51.529 --> 00:41:55.497
and find out if he needs any help, for
writing some letters or something,

00:41:55.698 --> 00:41:59.202
and also for typing anything –

00:41:59.403 --> 00:42:03.121
anybody who wants to help him, you see,
it’s essential,

00:42:03.321 --> 00:42:07.689
because I trouble him quite a lot.

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:13.439
And also you have a little account for
sending letters and things,

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:19.842
and for telephones, a little account can
be made. Everybody should -

00:42:20.043 --> 00:42:25.416
now, because we are expanding, we have
to have a proper system

00:42:25.616 --> 00:42:30.773
by which we work it out. So many letters
come to me every day,

00:42:30.974 --> 00:42:34.969
and I’m so lazy, I just can’t… I don’t
know.

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:40.203
I think if I write now, then another will
come tomorrow, so I wait for a while.

00:42:40.404 --> 00:42:44.474
Then I - but my attention is there. If you
write to me,

00:42:44.674 --> 00:42:47.118
I’m very happy because I know what is
happening.

00:42:47.319 --> 00:42:51.405
But don’t write very long letters, you
know.

00:42:54.392 --> 00:42:57.455
I like, I enjoy them, but if they are too
long,

00:42:57.656 --> 00:43:00.383
then, you know, the main thing is left out.

00:43:00.584 --> 00:43:08.554
We have to be to the point and properly
with the protocol and all that.

00:43:08.755 --> 00:43:13.742
There’s one gentleman who writes to me
regularly from India.

00:43:13.943 --> 00:43:16.743
His name is Mr. Brahme, Mr. Brahme.

00:43:16.944 --> 00:43:24.113
And he writes only two sentences:
one is that, “Mother,

00:43:24.459 --> 00:43:29.900
please bless me that I will be a good
sahaja yogi”,

00:43:30.101 --> 00:43:34.998
“Mother, please bless the whole world
that they become sahaja yogis,

00:43:35.199 --> 00:43:37.712
and the Sahaja Yoga spreads,

00:43:37.913 --> 00:43:45.072
and your most loving son at Your Lotus
Feet, so and so.” That’s all.

00:43:48.538 --> 00:43:54.759
Every - regularly, I must have so many
letters from him, that’s all.

00:43:56.918 --> 00:43:59.875
It’s good after all: whenever you write
praise and all that it’s good.

00:44:00.076 --> 00:44:05.546
But sometimes you know, we go on writing –

00:44:05.747 --> 00:44:12.371
like one gentleman has written, “I’ve been
working for two years,

00:44:12.572 --> 00:44:19.145
I’ve done everything, I’ve done nimbu,
I’ve done this,

00:44:19.346 --> 00:44:23.453
I’ve done this, I’ve done that and I’ve not
felt the vibrations”, you see.

00:44:23.656 --> 00:44:28.610
But the list of things he gave, you see,
made me laugh really:

00:44:28.811 --> 00:44:33.378
“Oh My, you must be fed up!”

00:44:34.364 --> 00:44:38.035
And the simple thing he is doing wrong,
which people didn’t understand

00:44:38.235 --> 00:44:40.759
that is he is doing Gayatri mantra.

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:46.345
If you do Gayatri mantra, it doesn’t
work out.

00:44:46.862 --> 00:44:51.141
I mean, this is so common, I mean, while
we are here,

00:44:51.342 --> 00:44:57.679
Gayatri mantra if people have done,
their right side is so much horrible,

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:03.724
and it doesn’t work out at all. So you have
to neutralise it with Lord’s Prayer,

00:45:03.925 --> 00:45:06.765
and with forgiveness to others,

00:45:06.966 --> 00:45:13.727
with the right hand towards the photograph
and left hand outside.

00:45:13.928 --> 00:45:18.964
And never to say Gayatri mantra again,
you see? But that’s what it is.

00:45:19.165 --> 00:45:25.208
But these small, small things people don’t
notice when I’m treating others.

00:45:25.425 --> 00:45:29.762
And I don’t know how to talk about it,
one by one,

00:45:29.963 --> 00:45:33.123
because when it comes before me, I know
the solution.

00:45:33.324 --> 00:45:37.222
So it’s better that you people note it down
what Mother does at that time.

00:45:37.423 --> 00:45:45.943
Now this Gayatri mantra is one of the worst
curses on human beings, I think.

00:45:46.145 --> 00:45:49.471
It is so right-sided.

00:45:50.379 --> 00:45:52.756
An Indian, if he does Gayatri mantra,

00:45:52.957 --> 00:46:03.055
he becomes ten times worse that any
westerner. Think of it.

00:46:03.256 --> 00:46:06.731
Now, can you read it? Now is it started?

00:46:07.027 --> 00:46:12.095
Yogis: Somebody has to set the frequency…
The right frequency for …

00:46:18.791 --> 00:46:25.667
Shri Mataji: Why not start the radio?
Yogi: I think everything’s on.

00:46:25.883 --> 00:46:31.521
Shri Mataji: Is there no radio there?
(Yogi: “Yes, Mother.”) What’s happening?

00:46:40.424 --> 00:46:44.162
Shri Mataji: Loudly, I can’t hear.

00:46:47.352 --> 00:46:51.568
Yogi: It begins after five, Mother.

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:12.542
Shri Mataji: Is it?

00:47:20.394 --> 00:47:23.276
More loudly.

00:48:16.612 --> 00:48:22.140
Is it yours? [Yogi: “No, Mother… it’s
a hour-long programme, Mother...”]

00:48:22.346 --> 00:48:25.623
[Yogi: “You see, we didn’t take all
of it…”] All right, all right.

00:48:31.204 --> 00:48:37.458
That’s better.

00:48:40.663 --> 00:48:46.069
You have to go through all nonsense
to listen to some sense of that.

00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:54.751
Gavin, what have you got? You read
the Bible, I think?

00:48:54.951 --> 00:48:59.602
Gavin: Yes. It’s a very appropriate psalm
we’ve discovered, Mother, very short…

00:48:59.803 --> 00:49:02.403
Shri Mataji: Must be, must be. Gavin: ...
for the ashrams. Shri Mataji: Eh?

00:49:02.604 --> 00:49:06.918
Gavin: It’s for the ashrams.
Shri Mataji: Lovely.

00:49:08.713 --> 00:49:13.007
Gavin: “Psalm 133.

00:49:13.294 --> 00:49:16.025
(1) Behold, how good and how pleasant it is

00:49:16.234 --> 00:49:20.584
for brethren to dwell together in unity!

00:49:20.785 --> 00:49:24.089
(2) It is like the precious ointment upon
the head,

00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:28.672
that ran down upon the beard, even
Aaron’s beard:

00:49:28.883 --> 00:49:32.834
that went down to the skirts of his
garments;

00:49:33.037 --> 00:49:39.874
(3) As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew
that descended upon the mountains of Zion:

00:49:40.075 --> 00:49:46.581
for there the Lord commanded the blessing,
even life for evermore”.

00:49:46.782 --> 00:49:54.032
Shri Mataji: See? Very beautiful you found
out, I must say.

00:50:01.937 --> 00:50:06.283
Now what is it? Devi Mahatmya you read
it out.

00:50:06.484 --> 00:50:11.277
[“SRIMAD DEVI BHAGAVATAM,”
BOOK 9, CHAPTER 3]

00:50:11.491 --> 00:50:17.241
Gavin: “Narayana said:– ‘O Devarshi!
The egg (born of Mula Prakriti)

00:50:17.442 --> 00:50:22.960
that was floating in the waters for a
period equal to the life period of Brahma,

00:50:23.168 --> 00:50:28.330
now in the fullness of time separated
into two parts.

00:50:28.531 --> 00:50:31.715
Within that egg there was a powerful child,

00:50:31.916 --> 00:50:38.207
lustrous like one thousand millions
of suns.” Shri Mataji: Suns. See.

00:50:38.408 --> 00:50:44.739
Gavin: “This child could not suck Mother’s
milk as it was forsaken by Her.

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:50.403
So, being tired of hunger, the child, for
a moment, cried repeatedly”.

00:50:50.604 --> 00:50:54.240
Shri Mataji: Forsaken because He had
to grow!

00:50:54.441 --> 00:50:58.959
Gavin: “The child that will become the lord
of countless Brahmandas (universes) -”

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:02.757
Shri Mataji: Countless Brahmandas.
Brahmandas are universes.

00:51:02.958 --> 00:51:05.792
Gavin: “…now an orphan having no father
nor mother

00:51:05.993 --> 00:51:10.271
began to look upwards from the waters.

00:51:10.506 --> 00:51:15.278
This boy came to be denominated afterwards
by the name of Maha Virat

00:51:15.479 --> 00:51:19.522
when He became gross and grosser.

00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:27.461
As there is nothing finer than radium, so
there is nothing grosser than Maha Virat.

00:51:27.799 --> 00:51:31.637
The power of this Maha Virat, one-sixteenth
of that of Shri Krishna,

00:51:31.837 --> 00:51:38.362
the Highest Self. But this boy…”
Shri Mataji: That is Yehova.

00:51:40.001 --> 00:51:43.287
Gavin: “…But this boy, (born of
the Prakruti Radha),

00:51:43.488 --> 00:51:49.084
is the Sole Stay of all this Universe”…
Shri Mataji: Sole Stay.

00:51:49.285 --> 00:51:54.153
Gavin: “… He is denominated by the name
Maha Vishnu.

00:51:54.354 --> 00:51:59.008
In his every pore countless universes
are existing.

00:51:59.209 --> 00:52:04.132
So much so that even Shri Krishna could
not count them.

00:52:04.333 --> 00:52:08.074
If it were possible to count the number
of dust particles,

00:52:08.275 --> 00:52:12.825
it is impossible to count the number
of the universes.

00:52:13.026 --> 00:52:17.536
So there are endless Brahmas, Vishnus,
and Maheshwaras.

00:52:17.737 --> 00:52:22.857
In every Brahmanda, there is Brahma,
Vishnu, and Mahesha.

00:52:23.058 --> 00:52:28.873
Each Brahmanda extends from Patala
to the Brahmaloka.

00:52:29.074 --> 00:52:32.210
The abode of Vaikuntha is higher than that

00:52:32.411 --> 00:52:38.035
(that is, it is situated outside
of Brahmanda),

00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:42.181
again the abode of Goloka is fifty koti
yojanas

00:52:42.382 --> 00:52:48.328
(that is 50 x 10 x 4 x 2 million miles)
higher than Vaikuntha.

00:52:48.592 --> 00:52:56.742
This Goloka Dhama is eternal and real
as Shri Krishna is eternal and real.

00:52:56.943 --> 00:53:02.382
This world composed of seven islands
is surrounded by the seven oceans.

00:53:02.583 --> 00:53:08.190
Forty-nine Upa Dvipas (smaller islands
adjacent to them) exist here.

00:53:08.391 --> 00:53:12.757
Besides there are countless mountains
and forests.

00:53:12.958 --> 00:53:16.523
Higher than this earth is the Brahmaloka
with seven heavens,

00:53:16.724 --> 00:53:19.844
and below this, are the seven Patalas.

00:53:20.045 --> 00:53:23.928
This is the bounding limit of Brahmanda.

00:53:24.129 --> 00:53:26.884
Just above this earth there is
the Bhurloka,

00:53:27.085 --> 00:53:31.190
above is Bhuvaloka, then Swahaloka,
then Janahloka,

00:53:31.391 --> 00:53:34.463
then Tapahloka, then Satyaloka, and
above that …”

00:53:34.664 --> 00:53:39.361
Shri Mataji: Mahaloka. Mahaloka not there?
Maha. Gavin: Brahmaloka.

00:53:39.562 --> 00:53:43.103
Shri Mataji: Bhur, Bhuvah, Swaha.
They call it Brahma.

00:53:43.304 --> 00:53:45.439
Gavin: Bhur, Bhuva, Swaha.
Shri Mataji: Swaha, Tapah.

00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:47.360
Gavin: Janah.
Shri Mataji: Janah. Tapah.

00:53:47.561 --> 00:53:51.200
Gavin: Satya and Brahmaloka.

00:53:51.401 --> 00:53:55.540
“The splendor of Brahmaloka is like that
of molten gold.

00:53:55.741 --> 00:54:01.661
But all the substances whether outside
or inside this Brahmaloka, are transient.

00:54:01.862 --> 00:54:06.541
When this Brahmanda dissolves, everything
dissolves and is destroyed.

00:54:06.742 --> 00:54:10.124
All are temporary like bubbles of water.

00:54:10.325 --> 00:54:15.264
Only Goloka and Vaikuntha are eternal.

00:54:15.479 --> 00:54:20.328
In every pore of this Maha Virat is
existing one Brahmanda.

00:54:20.547 --> 00:54:23.663
What to speak about…”. Shri Mataji: Hm.
Pore means any – every –

00:54:23.864 --> 00:54:27.477
what you call this, pore of the skin.

00:54:27.688 --> 00:54:34.189
One Brahmanda exists in Christ.
[Aside] Thank you.

00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:36.836
Gavin: “What to speak of others when
even Krishna cannot count

00:54:37.037 --> 00:54:39.764
the number of these Brahmandas.

00:54:39.972 --> 00:54:44.252
In every Brahmanda there is Brahma,
Vishnu and Mahesha.

00:54:44.453 --> 00:54:46.660
O Child Narada! In every Brahmanda,

00:54:46.861 --> 00:54:52.031
the number of the gods is three kotis
or 30 millions.

00:54:52.232 --> 00:54:55.368
Some of them are the Dikpatis (the Regents
of the quarters);

00:54:55.569 --> 00:54:58.687
some are the Dikpalas (the Rulers
of the quarters),

00:54:58.888 --> 00:55:02.104
some are asterisms, and some are planets.

00:55:02.305 --> 00:55:06.950
In the Bhurloka, there are four Varnas
(Brahmins, etc.,)

00:55:07.167 --> 00:55:10.589
and in the Patalas there are Nagas.

00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:15.659
Thus the Universe exists composed
of moveable and non-moveable things.

00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:19.248
(This is Brahmanda Vivriti).

00:55:19.449 --> 00:55:22.230
O Nârada! Now the Virat Purusha

00:55:22.446 --> 00:55:25.590
began to look up to the skies again
and again

00:55:25.791 --> 00:55:31.078
but He could not see anything within
that egg except the void.

00:55:31.279 --> 00:55:37.180
Then distressed with hunger He cried out
repeatedly and became merged in anxiety.

00:55:37.381 --> 00:55:39.994
Next moment getting back His consciousness,

00:55:40.195 --> 00:55:43.894
He began to think of Krishna, the Highest
Person

00:55:44.095 --> 00:55:48.311
and saw there at once the eternal light
of Brahma.

00:55:48.512 --> 00:55:52.460
He saw there His form as deep blue like
new rain-cloud;

00:55:52.661 --> 00:55:56.155
with two bands [Original text reads
“hands”], garment of a yellow color,

00:55:56.356 --> 00:56:00.554
sweet smile on His face, flute in His hand

00:56:00.755 --> 00:56:06.259
and He seemed to be very anxious to show
His Grace to Devotees.

00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:10.737
Looking at the Lord, His Father, the boy
became glad and smiled.

00:56:10.956 --> 00:56:16.609
The Lord, the bestower of boon, granted
Him boons appropriate for that moment.

00:56:16.813 --> 00:56:20.171
Oh child, let you possess knowledge
like me,

00:56:20.372 --> 00:56:23.277
let your hunger and thirst vanish:
let you ...”

00:56:23.478 --> 00:56:28.171
Shri Mataji: See. Hunger and thirst vanish.
He fasted for forty days.

00:56:28.372 --> 00:56:31.716
See, all the indications are there.

00:56:31.979 --> 00:56:34.610
Gavin: “…let you be the holder
of innumerable Brahmandas

00:56:34.811 --> 00:56:39.557
till the time of Pralaya (the universal
dissolution).

00:56:40.217 --> 00:56:42.671
Be without any selfishness,

00:56:42.879 --> 00:56:47.063
be fearless and the bestower of boons
to all.

00:56:47.264 --> 00:56:52.674
Let not old age, death, disease, sorrow
or any other ailings afflict thee.”

00:56:52.875 --> 00:56:57.407
Shri Mataji: This is a sign of a Brahma
Shakti.

00:56:57.611 --> 00:57:03.125
He Himself has said before that the Brahma
Shakti, or the Spirit

00:57:03.326 --> 00:57:09.656
does not die, does not get old and all
that, and He is telling him all that.

00:57:10.787 --> 00:57:15.674
Gavin: “Thus saying, He repeated thrice
on his ear the six-lettered great Mantra

00:57:15.875 --> 00:57:21.621
“Om Krishnaya Swaha” worshipped by
the Vedas with their Amgas,

00:57:21.822 --> 00:57:27.146
the Giver of desires and the destroyer
of all troubles and calamities.

00:57:27.347 --> 00:57:29.879
O Brahma’s Son! Thus giving the mantra,

00:57:30.096 --> 00:57:34.108
Shri Krishna arranged for His feeding thus.

00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:38.867
In every universe whatever offerings will
be given to Shri Krishna,

00:57:39.068 --> 00:57:43.967
one sixteenth of that will go to Narayana,
the Lord of Vaikuntha,

00:57:44.168 --> 00:57:49.670
and fifteen sixteenth is to go to this boy
the Virat. Shri Krishna…”

00:57:49.871 --> 00:57:52.681
Shri Mataji: He is Narayana also,
Shri Krishna is Narayana, you see.

00:57:52.882 --> 00:57:59.103
So one sixteenth will go to Narayana
and fifteen sixteenth to His son.

00:57:59.746 --> 00:58:03.013
Gavin: “Shri Krishna did not allot any
share for Himself.

00:58:03.213 --> 00:58:09.291
Himself transcending all the Gunas, full,
He is always satisfied with Himself.

00:58:09.513 --> 00:58:13.085
What necessity is there for any further
offerings?

00:58:13.286 --> 00:58:15.932
Whatever the people offer with devotion,

00:58:16.133 --> 00:58:20.687
the Lord of Lakshmi, the Virat eats
all these.

00:58:20.888 --> 00:58:25.723
Bhagavan Shri Krishna giving thus to
the Virat the boon and the mantra,

00:58:25.924 --> 00:58:32.122
said, “Oh child, say what more you desire.
I will give you that instantly.”

00:58:32.416 --> 00:58:36.775
The Virat boy hearing thus the words
of Shri Krishna spoke.

00:58:36.976 --> 00:58:41.417
“O, Thou Omnipresent, I have got no
desires whatsoever,

00:58:41.618 --> 00:58:46.692
save this that as long as I live, whether
for a short time or for a long time,

00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:51.189
me have pure bhakti towards Thy Lotus
Feet.”

00:58:51.390 --> 00:58:54.558
Shri Mataji: That’s why always Christ has
these fingers like this,

00:58:54.759 --> 00:59:01.088
one denoting towards Shri Krishna and
another towards Vishnu.

00:59:02.319 --> 00:59:05.998
He’s talked of His Father throughout.

00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:10.743
“For a short time or for a long time”:

00:59:10.943 --> 00:59:15.714
He lived for a short time and for a long
time.

00:59:21.468 --> 00:59:25.358
Gavin: “‘In this world he is Jivanmukta
(liberated whilst living)

00:59:25.559 --> 00:59:30.646
who is your Bhakta; and that bewildered
fool is dead while living

00:59:30.847 --> 00:59:33.559
who is devoid of any Bhakti to Thee.

00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:37.139
What needs he to perform Japam, asceticism,

00:59:37.350 --> 00:59:41.527
sacrifice, worship, holding fasts and
observances,

00:59:41.728 --> 00:59:46.120
going to sacred places of pilgrimages
and other virtuous acts

00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:49.678
if he be without any bhakti to
Shri Krishna?

00:59:49.879 --> 00:59:53.484
Vain is his life who is devoid of any
devotion to Shri Krishna,

00:59:53.685 --> 00:59:57.179
under Whose Grace he has obtained his life

00:59:57.380 --> 01:00:01.207
and Whom he does not now pay homage
and worship.

01:00:01.408 --> 01:00:07.030
He is endowed with Shakti as long as Atma
resides in his body;

01:00:07.231 --> 01:00:11.924
no sooner the Atma departs from his body
all the Shaktis accompany him.

01:00:12.125 --> 01:00:17.602
O Great One! And Thou art the Universal
Atman who transcends Prakriti,

01:00:17.803 --> 01:00:20.942
Who is All will, the Primeval Person -‘”
Shri Mataji: See?

01:00:21.143 --> 01:00:25.397
Gavin: “…and of the nature of the Highest
Light.

01:00:25.667 --> 01:00:30.039
O Child!” Thus saying, the Virat boy
remained silent.

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:34.210
Shri Krishna then spoke in sweet words,

01:00:34.411 --> 01:00:38.985
“Oh child, let you remain as fresh as ever
like Me.

01:00:39.186 --> 01:00:45.634
You will not have any fall even if
innumerable Brahmas pass away.

01:00:45.835 --> 01:00:51.141
Let you divide yourself in parts and turn
into smaller Virats in every universe.”

01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:53.214
Shri Mataji: That’s what He did.

01:00:53.415 --> 01:00:57.507
Gavin: “Brahma will spring from Your navel
and will create the cosmos.

01:00:57.708 --> 01:01:01.328
From the forehead of that Brahma will
spring eleven Rudras

01:01:01.528 --> 01:01:04.854
for the destruction of the creation.”
Shri Mataji: See.

01:01:05.055 --> 01:01:07.702
Gavin: “But they will all be parts
of Shiva.”

01:01:07.903 --> 01:01:11.087
Shri Mataji: That is given by Shiva to Him.

01:01:11.288 --> 01:01:17.376
You see, the eleven parts are given to this
child by Shiva.

01:01:18.718 --> 01:01:22.120
Gavin: “The Rudra named Kalagni, of these
eleven Rudras,

01:01:22.321 --> 01:01:27.290
will be the destroyer of all this Vishvas
(the cosmos).

01:01:27.491 --> 01:01:31.414
Besides, from each of your sub-divisions,
the Vishnu will originate

01:01:31.615 --> 01:01:37.157
and that Bhagavan Vishnu will be
the Preserver of this Vishvu world.

01:01:37.358 --> 01:01:41.908
I say that under My favour you will always
be full of bhakti towards Me

01:01:42.157 --> 01:01:48.360
and no sooner you meditate on Me, you
will be able to see My lovely form.

01:01:48.561 --> 01:01:53.294
There is no doubt in this; and your
Mother, Who resides in My breast,

01:01:53.503 --> 01:01:56.878
will not be difficult for you to see.”

01:01:57.079 --> 01:02:00.666
Shri Mataji: Better to see. Gavin: “Let
you remain here in ease and comfort.

01:02:00.867 --> 01:02:09.164
I now go to Goloka.” Saying thus Shri
Krishna, the Lord of world, disappears.

01:02:10.109 --> 01:02:15.686
Shri Mataji: See, it’s so clear cut. Better
send it to this Archbishop of Canterbury.

01:02:15.913 --> 01:02:19.311
What does he understand about Christ?

01:02:19.514 --> 01:02:25.162
That every pore of His skin is one
Brahmanda.

01:02:26.281 --> 01:02:28.715
So He became very gross, you see,

01:02:28.916 --> 01:02:32.303
in the sense that He came down
on this earth, you see,

01:02:32.504 --> 01:02:35.734
and then He became the Spirit.

01:02:37.576 --> 01:02:41.408
That’s why it is said, His “only Son.”

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:51.941
Yogi: Mother?

01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:01.127
Shri Mataji: What is happening?

01:03:03.398 --> 01:03:05.948
Nothing?

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:11.606
Yogi: Mother, may I read something for You?
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes.

01:03:12.147 --> 01:03:14.872
Yogi: Paul, Paul Duncan and I have written
this. Shri Mataji: Eh?

01:03:15.073 --> 01:03:16.957
Yogi: Paul Duncan and I have written this
for You.

01:03:17.158 --> 01:03:20.294
It’s called “Resurrection Sunday.”

01:03:20.495 --> 01:03:23.260
“We wandered lost in this confused age /

01:03:23.461 --> 01:03:26.734
You came to us like rain to a scorched
plain /

01:03:26.935 --> 01:03:29.070
We made so many foolish mistakes /

01:03:29.271 --> 01:03:32.120
But You laughed and loved us even more. /

01:03:32.321 --> 01:03:36.680
We walked always seeking Messiah’s return /

01:03:36.881 --> 01:03:39.175
And then You came with open arms. /

01:03:39.376 --> 01:03:42.019
We closed our hearts and ran our love dry /

01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:45.134
And You refreshed us with cooling Grace. /

01:03:45.335 --> 01:03:47.534
Mother, O Mother, River of Love /

01:03:47.735 --> 01:03:49.621
You wash our troubles away. /

01:03:49.823 --> 01:03:52.339
Mother, O Mother, Ocean of Joy /

01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:54.866
You are opening our flowers. /

01:03:55.067 --> 01:03:58.664
We struggled hard inside our shells /

01:03:58.865 --> 01:04:02.270
You took the eggs and made the doves. /

01:04:02.471 --> 01:04:05.941
We cried for love and forgot how to be /

01:04:06.142 --> 01:04:09.239
You wiped our tears and make us see. /

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:12.155
We needed the fulfillment of Christ’s
words /

01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:16.054
And then Mother Mary, You gave us
true second birth. /

01:04:16.257 --> 01:04:18.986
We languished in our man-made tombs /

01:04:19.213 --> 01:04:22.674
Divine Redeemer, You rolled away
the stone. /

01:04:22.875 --> 01:04:25.072
Mother, O Mother, River of Love /

01:04:25.307 --> 01:04:27.313
You wash all troubles away. /

01:04:27.514 --> 01:04:29.394
Mother, O Mother, Ocean of Joy /

01:04:29.613 --> 01:04:33.114
You open all the flowers.”

01:04:36.203 --> 01:04:39.592
Shri Mataji: So beautiful, I think.
Very beautiful.

01:04:39.793 --> 01:04:44.817
It’s like a mantra working on my
vibrations.

01:04:54.405 --> 01:04:57.322
So now all our programmes are fixed
for different days,

01:04:57.523 --> 01:05:04.698
and now I have received a letter from –
again from him, Jim,

01:05:04.899 --> 01:05:10.031
saying that he would like to have
a programme from the 15th of June now.

01:05:10.235 --> 01:05:17.913
And I personally think that he has put
last two days –

01:05:18.114 --> 01:05:25.945
one day to Norwich, and then one day
in Cambridge, then Norwich,

01:05:26.146 --> 01:05:36.033
I think 17th is Cambridge, 18th Norwich
and again Cambridge, and then Puja.

01:05:36.610 --> 01:05:40.214
Best is to keep two days in Cambridge –
first Norwich,

01:05:40.415 --> 01:05:43.593
that will be - what date did I tell you
to have Norwich?

01:05:43.794 --> 01:05:46.381
Yogi: The 18th, Jai Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: 18th should be Norwich,

01:05:46.582 --> 01:05:54.101
19th and 20th Cambridge, and 21st will
be the Puja. All right?

01:05:54.302 --> 01:05:58.697
Just change that much, otherwise it’s
perfectly alright.

01:06:02.158 --> 01:06:07.625
What else? Kevin, how are you?

01:06:07.826 --> 01:06:10.740
Yogi: Sorry, Shri Mataji…
Shri Mataji: Hot? Very hot?

01:06:10.941 --> 01:06:16.158
Yogi: No, I was late, I didn’t have time
to change my clothes.

01:06:16.359 --> 01:06:19.131
Shri Mataji: You are all right!

01:06:23.932 --> 01:06:26.175
You are all right.

01:06:26.386 --> 01:06:31.601
You see, when the Mother has seen you
in your “birthday suits”

01:06:31.802 --> 01:06:38.274
why should you worry about any dress
with your Mother, isn’t it?

01:06:41.065 --> 01:06:45.365
There is no formality with the Mother.

01:06:45.565 --> 01:06:47.646
It’s all right, She likes to see you
properly clad,

01:06:47.846 --> 01:06:51.811
but there’s nothing, no formality.

01:06:52.012 --> 01:06:55.645
[Aside, to somebody:] Thank you, that’s
all, thank you very much.

01:06:56.154 --> 01:06:58.205
[To the yogi] But you look serious, that’s
what I want to know.

01:06:58.405 --> 01:07:02.488
Yogi: Oh, I’m worried whether the Divine
is coming through on the tape.

01:07:02.689 --> 01:07:04.550
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.
Yogi: Because I don’t know!

01:07:04.751 --> 01:07:09.200
Shri Mataji: Yes, I was wondering what’s
the matter, why are you so serious –

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:14.380
no, I just thought, maybe because now
you are married

01:07:14.581 --> 01:07:19.226
and you are thinking of a married life now,

01:07:20.274 --> 01:07:26.045
what to do, and - No? No problems?
Yogi: No, no.

01:07:26.971 --> 01:07:29.997
Shri Mataji: You see, when you even tell
somebody, “You have to get married”,

01:07:30.198 --> 01:07:36.448
suddenly they … as if somebody has stuck
a pistol!

01:07:36.649 --> 01:07:41.850
That’s the first reaction I have seen
many-a-times.

01:07:42.051 --> 01:07:45.506
Pat has not come today? Yogini: No, Grazyna
is not very well, Mother.

01:07:45.707 --> 01:07:48.914
Shri Mataji: Hmm?
Yogini: Grazyna is still not very well...

01:07:49.115 --> 01:07:50.943
Shri Mataji: I know, poor thing.

01:07:51.143 --> 01:07:56.073
Yogini: They’d like to come and see You
next week…

01:07:56.542 --> 01:08:00.343
Shri Mataji: I have told - her problem
is basically something different,

01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:04.622
and I have told the solution and I’ve asked
Gavin, Gavin to find out.

01:08:04.823 --> 01:08:07.848
Did you ask Sarah?
Gavin: I didn’t get the chance just yet.

01:08:08.049 --> 01:08:12.145
Shri Mataji: But Sarah is here, you can
talk to her.

01:08:12.346 --> 01:08:18.383
You see, we have a, we had a doctor
in India called Dr. Shirolkar,

01:08:18.584 --> 01:08:21.007
and he devised an operation – you might
have heard his name

01:08:21.207 --> 01:08:22.706
[Yogini comments probably on name,
Shri Mataji: “Ah”] –

01:08:22.907 --> 01:08:27.981
to strengthen the … - Who is crying
so much?

01:08:28.181 --> 01:08:30.283
Just see the child -

01:08:30.502 --> 01:08:35.728
the lower wall, the lower wall of
the uterus, you see?

01:08:35.929 --> 01:08:39.167
And that operation somebody must be
doing here also, I’m sure.

01:08:39.368 --> 01:08:43.298
Yogini: Yes, she had it. Shri Mataji: Eh?
Yogini: She had it done.

01:08:43.561 --> 01:08:47.984
Shri Mataji: She had that operation?
Yogini: She did, but it’s still… she still…

01:08:48.192 --> 01:08:51.006
Shri Mataji: No, but then she conceived
very early then. [Yogini: “Sorry?”]

01:08:51.207 --> 01:08:55.406
You have to wait after that to develop
into a proper…

01:08:55.607 --> 01:09:00.085
she had that kind of an operation, did she?
Yogini: I think she did it, yes.

01:09:01.204 --> 01:09:04.211
Shri Mataji: Then she should have waited
to see that the wall is fully developed,

01:09:04.411 --> 01:09:11.177
I think if she had allowed to - I’m going
to work out something else for her.

01:09:12.872 --> 01:09:18.794
You can have another layer just to make it
strong, you see? [Yogini: “Yes.”]

01:09:28.121 --> 01:09:31.301
Any other problems?

01:09:37.484 --> 01:09:43.565
[To a yogini] How are you now? Gail?
All right?

01:09:47.424 --> 01:09:49.325
Don’t do any heavy work, but walking
is good.

01:09:49.526 --> 01:09:52.694
In Regent Park, you can go in the morning
for a walk, not in (unclear word)

01:09:52.895 --> 01:09:56.572
but it’s a good place to walk about
little bit.

01:09:56.773 --> 01:09:59.180
[To another yogini] How are you? Why don’t
you sit on a chair,

01:09:59.381 --> 01:10:03.812
will be better, better. Better sit down
on a chair.

01:10:04.013 --> 01:10:08.942
Go. Go there, to sit down.

01:10:11.205 --> 01:10:14.494
So how are you? [Yogini: “I’m all right…” ]
Good.

01:10:14.695 --> 01:10:20.891
I’m happy you could come. I’m happy
you could come.

01:10:27.034 --> 01:10:31.257
Received any letter? He is telephoning me,

01:10:31.458 --> 01:10:36.510
he is telling me that he is trying to get
the permission and this and that,

01:10:36.711 --> 01:10:39.872
he’s going to write to me again. His style
is like this.

01:10:40.081 --> 01:10:48.215
You see, he doesn’t want to talk about it
unless he really gets the permission.

01:10:48.557 --> 01:10:52.140
Yogini: I wrote to him.
Shri Mataji: You've written to him, yes.

01:10:52.379 --> 01:10:55.589
He telephones to me.

01:11:02.311 --> 01:11:07.851
All suspiciousness, you see, because he is
in the Air Force,

01:11:08.052 --> 01:11:11.259
and the government is suspicious
of foreigners, you see,

01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:16.966
marrying any Air Force this thing, you see.

01:11:18.586 --> 01:11:21.870
I just don’t understand.

01:11:22.807 --> 01:11:25.579
So I would say take my passport, you have
to walk like a criminal

01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:27.865
with your passport number, this, that,

01:11:28.066 --> 01:11:32.771
and you have to get my visas in Rome
and these places.

01:11:32.972 --> 01:11:36.711
But I think he can do it, Dinesh knows
how to do it.

01:11:36.912 --> 01:11:38.973
Tell him to go to Varad, Varad Rajan,

01:11:39.174 --> 01:11:43.321
he’ll give him, because is a diplomatic
passport.

01:11:52.163 --> 01:11:56.820
How are you now, Kay, are you better? Hm.

01:12:00.487 --> 01:12:03.987
Bala, what about your chickenpox?

01:12:05.543 --> 01:12:09.122
Gone?
Bala: It’s gone.

01:12:11.814 --> 01:12:14.851
Shri Mataji: Djamel, how are you?

01:12:16.494 --> 01:12:21.444
Djamel: I’ve got the Agnya problem.
Shri Mataji: Agnya?

01:12:30.903 --> 01:12:35.675
On the day of Resurrection Agnya should
clear out.

01:12:35.914 --> 01:12:40.164
Somebody has done everything for us, you
see? Best is to rely on that, all done!

01:12:40.365 --> 01:12:43.959
What, so why should we worry?

01:12:46.281 --> 01:12:49.071
Hm, better.

01:12:50.873 --> 01:12:54.003
Hm. Everything is done for you,

01:12:54.204 --> 01:12:57.824
I mean, lucky people I must say.

01:12:58.025 --> 01:13:02.600
Like guests, you see? That till, all
others have to do everything for you,

01:13:02.801 --> 01:13:06.627
and you have the fruits of it. Isn’t it?
A good situation.

01:13:06.828 --> 01:13:14.103
But still you look so worried.

01:13:17.017 --> 01:13:23.107
As we say, there’s a dog walking under
a cart.

01:13:23.323 --> 01:13:29.105
He looks very worried because he thinks
he is carrying the cart, you see.

01:13:29.306 --> 01:13:37.162
And the poor – the one, one, the bullocks
which are pulling the cart are quite happy.

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:45.980
Better now?

01:13:47.950 --> 01:13:54.226
Is it true that in Islam they hate dogs?
Yogi: No, Mother.

01:13:54.427 --> 01:13:58.962
Shri Mataji: No? No. They don’t hate dogs.

01:13:59.163 --> 01:14:04.719
In Iran they – I don’t know why they hate
dogs so much.

01:14:04.922 --> 01:14:08.646
Somebody was telling me that they ill-treat
dogs, absolutely.

01:14:08.847 --> 01:14:12.014
I said, “Surprising it is.”
Yogi: Same in Malaysia.

01:14:12.215 --> 01:14:14.498
Shri Mataji: Hm? Yogi: They are not well
treated, animals in general

01:14:14.699 --> 01:14:16.375
are not well treated.
Shri Mataji: They?

01:14:16.576 --> 01:14:20.919
Yogi: They are very badly treated, You
know? Shri Mataji: Badly treated.

01:14:21.143 --> 01:14:27.632
Because, you see, they have become little
insensitive to animals, I think so.

01:14:27.834 --> 01:14:30.870
Like here people treat the dogs very
kindly,

01:14:31.071 --> 01:14:34.974
but their children very unkindly.
Is the other way round.

01:14:35.175 --> 01:14:39.400
I mean, it’s - just don’t understand, it’s
a mystery as I said.

01:15:02.342 --> 01:15:05.058
Those who want to see me, can come.

01:15:05.259 --> 01:15:10.514
Tomorrow evening I’ll be at home.

01:15:12.371 --> 01:15:14.835
All right?

01:15:16.463 --> 01:15:19.689
About, say, six o’clock.

01:15:20.071 --> 01:15:25.298
Then Sahasrara Puja must be fixed in the
evening, so that everybody can make it.

01:15:25.499 --> 01:15:29.604
Say about seven o’clock, that would be
good.

01:15:29.805 --> 01:15:35.126
Many people can come there – evening
because it’s a Wednesday or something.

01:15:35.358 --> 01:15:39.511
It’s a Wednesday? [Gavin: “Yes”] So Tuesday-
Wednesday Thursday- Friday, perhaps?

01:15:39.712 --> 01:15:43.165
Gavin: No, it’s a Wednesday.
Shri Mataji: It’s a Wednesday?

01:15:43.857 --> 01:15:45.947
Are you sure?

01:15:46.147 --> 01:15:49.021
Because if second is Tuesday…
Gavin: No, second is Sunday.

01:15:49.222 --> 01:15:52.294
Shri Mataji: Hm? Second is Tuesday.
Gavin: No, it’s Sunday.

01:15:52.495 --> 01:15:55.790
Shri Mataji: Is a Sunday. Then it’s all
right, Wednesday.

01:15:55.991 --> 01:16:00.932
So one should try to have it about seven
o’clock,

01:16:01.133 --> 01:16:04.076
so that others can come in for the puja.

01:16:04.277 --> 01:16:07.845
Now, is it over? Or…

01:16:09.036 --> 01:16:12.681
Yogi: … John Glower is here, and he’s
supposed to be …

01:16:12.882 --> 01:16:16.190
Shri Mataji: Where is he?

01:16:18.465 --> 01:16:21.726
So we can start the puja business because
otherwise it will get very late.

01:16:21.927 --> 01:16:27.152
All right? [Yogi: “Yes.”] When you, when
you get it…

01:16:27.379 --> 01:16:31.523
Yogi: …called Sahaja. Sahaja comes from
Indian language and it means

01:16:31.724 --> 01:16:35.403
“born with you”, or “spontaneous”, because
essentially Yoga

01:16:35.604 --> 01:16:39.323
isn’t just something that allows to keep
fit as has become in the West now.

01:16:39.524 --> 01:16:43.052
Yoga means union, union of your Self and
your Spirit,

01:16:43.253 --> 01:16:50.345
or of your Spirit and the Great Spirit,
which is the Divine, or God (…).

01:16:50.546 --> 01:16:54.504
And in that in fact your Spirit – which
again people nowadays

01:16:54.705 --> 01:16:56.813
don’t even know exists, most of them
usually feel embarrassed

01:16:57.014 --> 01:17:00.212
when you talk about souls and Spirit,
in fact is a reality.

01:17:00.436 --> 01:17:04.499
It is that within which is the true nature,

01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:10.242
its qualities are pure bliss, pure
consciousness and truth.

01:17:10.443 --> 01:17:15.887
And if one can experience that Spirit
consciously, then obviously

01:17:16.110 --> 01:17:19.045
one can be a very blissful person and not
have the problems that most people have.

01:17:19.246 --> 01:17:22.802
The question is: how do you get it? And
Sahaja means it is spontaneous,

01:17:23.010 --> 01:17:27.489
in other words something now for the first
time has made spontaneous

01:17:27.690 --> 01:17:33.173
Self-Realization, or knowing yourself fully
possible for the first time.

01:17:33.374 --> 01:17:35.259
Interviewer: You say “something”. Just
what is this something?

01:17:35.459 --> 01:17:40.550
Yogi: This something is the fact that in
the sacrum bone,

01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:44.927
which is the bone at the base of the spine,
is a being,

01:17:45.128 --> 01:17:48.536
that we call Kundalini, people in the East
call it as Kundalini.

01:17:48.736 --> 01:17:53.298
The Christians also have come across it,
but they called it Holy Spirit.

01:17:53.499 --> 01:17:55.890
Jesus has talked about it too. And …
Interviewer: The fact that the Christians

01:17:56.091 --> 01:17:58.536
that it is in the bone, they wouldn’t like.
Yogi: No, they wouldn’t, no, they wouldn’t

01:17:58.737 --> 01:18:01.199
but nevertheless Christ talked about it,
that’s the essential thing,

01:18:01.399 --> 01:18:05.270
not that the Christians would necessarily;
but rather what Christ said.

01:18:05.471 --> 01:18:13.429
Now, somehow this being, which is
the Divine inside,

01:18:13.630 --> 01:18:19.624
has to link up the individual Spirit - we
say the Atma, the personal Spirit -

01:18:19.825 --> 01:18:24.041
with the One, the Divine, right? And
the way that happens

01:18:24.242 --> 01:18:29.791
is that the Kundalini rises up the spine,
enlightens Spirit,

01:18:29.992 --> 01:18:34.164
and pierces – it goes to actually seven
subtle centres called chakras –

01:18:34.372 --> 01:18:36.778
which I will tell about in a minute if you
like –

01:18:36.979 --> 01:18:40.673
until it pierces the fontanel bone on top
of the head,

01:18:40.874 --> 01:18:42.967
this top chakra, the top center.

01:18:43.168 --> 01:18:46.360
When that happens, the personal spiritual
reality inside,

01:18:46.561 --> 01:18:49.251
which is the Spirit and the subtle centres
and the Kundalini,

01:18:49.452 --> 01:18:52.318
which is latent if you like Divine power
within,

01:18:52.519 --> 01:18:55.799
all are brought into the conscious nervous
system for the first time.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.978
Interviewer: If this is there, or has been
there all the time,

01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:00.891
why is it that it hasn’t happened before?
Yogi: Why it hasn’t happened before,

01:19:01.092 --> 01:19:03.433
well, it happened before in a few cases,

01:19:03.634 --> 01:19:07.222
there have been enlightened people who were
great saints,

01:19:07.423 --> 01:19:09.878
people with immense courage and spiritual
power

01:19:10.079 --> 01:19:11.937
who did have their Self-Realisation before,

01:19:12.137 --> 01:19:15.921
I mean you could say that Lord Buddha
was a man

01:19:16.129 --> 01:19:19.852
who, because of his great perfection,
attained his spiritual life,

01:19:20.053 --> 01:19:21.854
in other words the Kundalini came up fully,

01:19:22.055 --> 01:19:25.214
and he was totally as we’d say
God-realised, in other words

01:19:25.422 --> 01:19:28.952
he became a hollow personality flowing
as if played through, his ego just went,

01:19:29.153 --> 01:19:32.554
as well as his conditionings went, and he
was just as the Spirit.

01:19:32.770 --> 01:19:35.227
And now it happens to anybody, and this is
the main thing,

01:19:35.428 --> 01:19:38.295
this is the interesting, exciting and
thoroughly enjoyable thing;

01:19:38.496 --> 01:19:41.795
but now, it isn’t a case that just a few
sages go and live on a mountain

01:19:41.996 --> 01:19:43.976
in a pure, absolutely perfect knowledge

01:19:44.177 --> 01:19:47.651
may at the end of all [unclear] time
get their Self-Realisation:

01:19:47.852 --> 01:19:51.131
now, any of us who desire it, any of us
who are seeking it,

01:19:51.331 --> 01:19:53.881
genuine seekers can get their
Self-Realisation.

01:19:54.082 --> 01:19:57.361
And the reason for that is that an Indian
lady, called Mataji,

01:19:57.561 --> 01:19:59.913
Her Holiness Mataji Nirmala Devi,

01:20:00.114 --> 01:20:04.923
has come absolutely foremost to give
this gift of Self-Realisation,

01:20:05.131 --> 01:20:07.791
by which – not that She is a guru who has
come just to,

01:20:07.992 --> 01:20:11.129
you know, have people sit at Her feet,
and pay money and so on;

01:20:11.330 --> 01:20:13.731
on the contrary, She said you can’t pay
for the Divine,

01:20:13.932 --> 01:20:18.514
you can’t pay for your Yoga, your Union
with your Spirit and God.

01:20:18.715 --> 01:20:23.628
It happens spontaneously, and the reason
it happens, is because in Her presence

01:20:23.829 --> 01:20:28.439
vibrations which come from Her, or even
from the photograph of Her,

01:20:28.648 --> 01:20:31.465
come in through the upper side
of the hands,

01:20:31.666 --> 01:20:35.564
and that acts as a trigger for
the Kundalini which is residing,

01:20:35.765 --> 01:20:38.386
which as you say we don’t know about,
which may have been there –

01:20:38.587 --> 01:20:41.960
is there nevertheless whether we know
about it or not - at the base of the spine.

01:20:42.161 --> 01:20:44.805
This rises up and that cool breeze,

01:20:45.012 --> 01:20:46.672
what you feel as cool breeze in your hands,
all right?

01:20:46.873 --> 01:20:49.532
Vibrations flowing from Mataji
in full-fledged form –

01:20:49.733 --> 01:20:53.059
the Kundalini then comes up and you begin
to feel things in your…

01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:55.710
Interviewer: There are many people that - do you know that the real fact is,

01:20:55.911 --> 01:20:56.877
and I have to say this…
Yogi: Yes.

01:20:57.078 --> 01:20:59.153
Interviewer: …is that there are lots and
lots of people

01:20:59.353 --> 01:21:01.241
who are saying very similar types
of things;

01:21:01.465 --> 01:21:08.048
and also lots of people, let’s have it,
just… (indistinct words), you know.

01:21:08.249 --> 01:21:11.843
What’s the difference between this one
and the rest? Yogi: Right.

01:21:12.044 --> 01:21:13.703
There are lots of differences, but
admittedly,

01:21:13.904 --> 01:21:17.557
because of the age we’re living in, because
there are so many things around,

01:21:17.758 --> 01:21:23.170
some of which have been absolutely proved
by psychologists and other people,

01:21:23.371 --> 01:21:27.249
just intelligent people, to be absolutely
dangerous and damaging to people.

01:21:27.450 --> 01:21:29.683
That has to tell you the difference,
you have to have a discernment.

01:21:29.884 --> 01:21:33.353
Discernment, as I said beforehand is that
you have to judge Mataji,

01:21:33.553 --> 01:21:37.663
you have to judge Sahaja Yoga on what you
feel about it I suppose, right?

01:21:37.864 --> 01:21:40.708
Before your Realisation. And also using
consent.

01:21:40.947 --> 01:21:44.215
But Mataji’s message is this: you can’t pay
for the Divine, absolutely not,

01:21:44.416 --> 01:21:46.946
it’s satanic to try and pay for the Divine.

01:21:47.170 --> 01:21:50.563
Secondly, if a thing is genuine, you are
not going to get bad side effects,

01:21:50.764 --> 01:21:53.521
you are not going to feel ill: if a thing
is holy and is good and pure

01:21:53.722 --> 01:21:58.780
you’ll feel good; and it will be obvious in
your whole personality (indistinct words).

01:21:58.981 --> 01:22:01.799
And equally,

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:06.656
you can’t come to this spiritual
Realisation, or God you could say,

01:22:06.857 --> 01:22:09.800
or your Spirit or the truth, you can’t come
to that

01:22:10.024 --> 01:22:14.030
on a path which is unrighteous, you can’t
come to that on a path

01:22:14.230 --> 01:22:19.762
of unholiness, of immorality, or
of extreme behaviour.

01:22:19.964 --> 01:22:23.124
Interviewer: But you know, there are lots
of others who tell exactly the same words.

01:22:23.325 --> 01:22:25.563
Then  what’s the difference between
yourselves and say Raja Yoga?

01:22:25.764 --> 01:22:27.128
Now they don’t get money either.

01:22:27.336 --> 01:22:29.107
Yogi: The fact is that we have the actual
happening,

01:22:29.307 --> 01:22:31.845
which you can feel inside yourself, you
feel the cool breeze.

01:22:32.046 --> 01:22:35.469
When you get Realisation, and anybody
gets it - you don’t have to pay for it -

01:22:35.670 --> 01:22:38.973
you feel the cool breeze in your hands
coming from the picture or from Mataji.

01:22:39.181 --> 01:22:41.207
As soon as you actually feel, and you have
to verify for yourself,

01:22:41.414 --> 01:22:43.993
and you might say “there’s a cool breeze”,
doesn’t make a cool breeze;

01:22:44.194 --> 01:22:46.741
but if you feel the cool breeze you can’t
really deny it.

01:22:46.942 --> 01:22:49.181
Secondly, you feel cool which comes out
of your head,

01:22:49.382 --> 01:22:51.588
when you get Realisation, not before.

01:22:51.789 --> 01:22:55.812
Thirdly, you begin to feel all this
extremely subtle, very sensitive

01:22:56.013 --> 01:23:00.836
and beautifully made creation which is
the human personality.

01:23:01.037 --> 01:23:04.468
You begin to feel its subtleties.
Interviewer: Where does this all lead us?

01:23:04.669 --> 01:23:07.662
Where is it going to take us? Yogi: It
takes us into the future, absolutely,

01:23:07.863 --> 01:23:11.054
or you could say into the present; it takes
you to yourself.

01:23:11.255 --> 01:23:15.551
When the Kundalini goes through the second
to the top chakra - the sixth chakra,

01:23:15.752 --> 01:23:17.846
you come into the present and you enter
a state

01:23:18.047 --> 01:23:20.570
of thoughtless awareness, spontaneously.
It’s absolutely natural,

01:23:20.771 --> 01:23:23.316
it just happens, when the Kundalini
reaches that point.

01:23:23.517 --> 01:23:30.599
The reason for that is that, suppose you
are thinking,

01:23:30.815 --> 01:23:34.804
you can’t possibly be in the present, you
can’t be aware of the actually present.

01:23:35.005 --> 01:23:37.367
You can be aware of just what’s just
passed,

01:23:37.568 --> 01:23:39.437
or what’s going to happen in a very short
time,

01:23:39.638 --> 01:23:41.885
but you can’t be aware of the absolute
present.

01:23:42.086 --> 01:23:45.406
So the only way to be in the present,
absolutely, is to be thoughtless,

01:23:45.607 --> 01:23:50.723
and the Kundalini does this, when it
crosses that point on the forehead.

01:23:50.924 --> 01:23:54.266
Then you just become thoughtlessly aware
and we are in that state all the time.

01:23:54.467 --> 01:23:57.606
All we do is in that state. It sounds
strange, but it’s a reality.

01:23:57.807 --> 01:24:00.580
The cares go, the troubles go, your
problems go, as these chakras

01:24:00.781 --> 01:24:03.361
get cleared out by the Kundalini rising up,

01:24:03.562 --> 01:24:06.319
it clears out all the awful things that
cause the problems;

01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:10.245
and you become in the end a joyful being.

01:24:10.446 --> 01:24:13.076
Interviewer: And should you be interested,
She is holding a meeting at Caxton Hall

01:24:13.277 --> 01:24:19.820
on Wednesday the fourteenth of April
at 7pm, everyone is welcome.

01:24:33.728 --> 01:24:37.700
Yogi: This is what was just set up before
doing that.

01:24:39.836 --> 01:24:46.956
Shri Mataji: Ah? Now, the one point that’s
very important to be said

01:24:47.157 --> 01:24:53.074
on such interview, you see, is that you
become empowered by your own powers.

01:24:53.275 --> 01:24:58.146
You yourself know, you can feel it,
the other person, you can feel yourself

01:24:58.347 --> 01:25:03.970
and you know how to maneuver, you see,
this Kundalini of others;

01:25:04.171 --> 01:25:06.279
you can give Realisations to others;

01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:10.288
you can cure others; your power is
released.

01:25:10.489 --> 01:25:14.741
Your power of your Spirit is released
on your central nervous system.

01:25:14.949 --> 01:25:17.357
That would be really convincing; that is
not my power,

01:25:17.558 --> 01:25:20.898
it’s your own power you can feel.

01:25:21.896 --> 01:25:26.214
Yogini: Mother, it seems, through talking
of other groups,

01:25:26.415 --> 01:25:29.528
they do all say very much the same
as we do,

01:25:29.729 --> 01:25:34.756
but the only thing that we should say –
really has to be convincingly -

01:25:34.957 --> 01:25:38.210
is that we do have such powers.
Shri Mataji: That’s it.

01:25:38.411 --> 01:25:40.245
Yogini: That’s it.
Shri Mataji: Just talking is very easy.

01:25:40.445 --> 01:25:43.262
You see, if read some books, they talk.

01:25:43.463 --> 01:25:46.670
See, they read a Sahaj Yoga book, they can
say, “I have a Kundalini awakening.

01:25:46.871 --> 01:25:49.563
I can see the chakras. I can…” All right,
say!

01:25:49.764 --> 01:25:53.059
Ask them, “Can you feel our chakras?”
[Yogi: “That’s all.”]

01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:57.747
That’s all. Then what do they agree?

01:25:57.948 --> 01:26:01.959
Then what do they say; are they going
to come?

01:26:02.571 --> 01:26:04.228
Yogini: Some of them have done, yes,
Mother, we were...

01:26:04.429 --> 01:26:06.698
Shri Mataji: I think you should go and meet
them, again and again.

01:26:06.899 --> 01:26:09.950
(Yogini: “Yes, Mother.”) You see,
Amar Samati asked –

01:26:10.151 --> 01:26:14.014
he went to Santa Cruz, absolutely a new
place.

01:26:14.215 --> 01:26:16.550
And he met people and talked to them and
told them,

01:26:16.751 --> 01:26:20.608
“See, you are not feeling anything, why are
you adhering to any group, for what?

01:26:20.809 --> 01:26:24.318
For paying money? For what? Because you
have been doing it,

01:26:24.519 --> 01:26:26.762
but you are not feeling any vibrations,
nothing;

01:26:26.962 --> 01:26:30.818
you are not feeling anything, you have
no powers.” And he convinced them.

01:26:31.019 --> 01:26:33.567
And he said, “There will be at least five
to six hundred people,” and there were –

01:26:33.768 --> 01:26:37.461
more than that, for that programme.

01:26:37.662 --> 01:26:39.363
That’s what you have to go and tell them,
“What have you got?

01:26:39.564 --> 01:26:42.280
You haven’t got any powers. We have,
we can feel you.

01:26:42.481 --> 01:26:47.139
We know this is what, this is your chakra
is here, that is there.” That’s the thing.

01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:51.547
Yogini: Mother, there is a very funny
story, we went to see some Buddhists,

01:26:51.748 --> 01:26:55.566
and I asked one of them (...) what
enlightenment was.

01:26:55.767 --> 01:26:58.341
Shri Mataji: Hm. Yogini: And he gave me
a very flurry answer.

01:26:58.542 --> 01:27:03.265
And I said to him, “Do you think you will
get it in this lifetime?”

01:27:03.466 --> 01:27:06.380
And he says: “Oh I don’t know, I think it
might be possible.”

01:27:06.581 --> 01:27:09.521
And I said, “Well, how would you know it
when you get it?”

01:27:09.722 --> 01:27:12.616
He said, “Oh, I suppose it will dawn on me
one day.”

01:27:12.817 --> 01:27:14.874
And as he said that, his Kundalini came up!

01:27:15.090 --> 01:27:16.416
Shri Mataji: It will what, it will what?

01:27:16.617 --> 01:27:19.181
Yogini: He said, “I suppose it will dawn
on me one day.”

01:27:19.405 --> 01:27:22.993
And as he said it his Kundalini came up.

01:27:26.279 --> 01:27:28.730
Shri Mataji: Good.

01:27:32.190 --> 01:27:35.494
I’m also sending – you see these… Somehow,
with my husband’s job,

01:27:35.695 --> 01:27:39.242
I meet people who are seekers and who are
placed at the helm of affairs.

01:27:39.443 --> 01:27:41.018
I’m sending them books, you see?

01:27:41.219 --> 01:27:47.999
And I want to send one of the, one of our
books, to Indonesia.

01:27:48.207 --> 01:27:50.907
There’s an ambassador from Indonesia
who’s very anxious,

01:27:51.108 --> 01:27:54.119
so he has been writing to my husband that,
“You haven’t sent the book as yet.”

01:27:54.319 --> 01:27:57.366
So we’ll have to send it there.

01:28:05.999 --> 01:28:08.713
Yogini: Mother, Warren has sent this
cassette up,

01:28:08.914 --> 01:28:12.947
it’s the first VHS copy of the…
(inaudible audio)

01:28:17.234 --> 01:28:22.494
Shri Mataji: Oh all right, let’s see.
Can we see here?

01:28:30.625 --> 01:28:34.111
I don’t know what nail paint these people
have put, I don’t know.

01:28:34.334 --> 01:28:40.078
Indian. Doesn’t go with any English
nail paint remover.

01:28:40.278 --> 01:28:42.955
Can you believe it?

01:28:44.718 --> 01:28:48.389
Shines, though…

01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:57.152
I’ll just come back from -

01:28:57.542 --> 01:29:02.069
It’s a good one, no doubt. And it’s come
out very well.

01:29:18.122 --> 01:29:21.607
…and also it shakes a little bit, but
doesn’t matter,

01:29:21.808 --> 01:29:23.686
but doesn’t matter, we can’t help it,
you see,

01:29:23.902 --> 01:29:30.679
because originals we have in any case
and, but these must be transferred.

01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:33.951
But all the new ones should be done
on VHS, you see.

01:29:34.152 --> 01:29:36.708
That’s a better new system to use, you see?

01:29:36.924 --> 01:29:43.218
That’s a better idea I think, than to use
the, that one and then transfer it.

01:29:43.418 --> 01:29:47.318
It’s quite good, I mean, as far as …
I mean, it gives - it fits all right,

01:29:47.518 --> 01:29:49.502
but could be better if you have direct.

01:29:49.703 --> 01:29:54.093
But as it is we don’t want them to be lost,
everybody would like to hear,

01:29:54.294 --> 01:29:57.054
and some of them are very powerful
in Houston and all that.

01:29:57.255 --> 01:30:00.719
Have you got Houston one here?

01:30:00.982 --> 01:30:03.516
Gavin: There is at least one Houston,
Mother, I don’t know where it is now,

01:30:03.717 --> 01:30:06.452
maybe Warren will send.
Shri Mataji: Alright, so ask him

01:30:06.653 --> 01:30:11.856
to send some Houston things for people
to see, they were very powerful.

01:30:12.065 --> 01:30:14.465
Specially on Christ I spoke very well.

01:30:14.698 --> 01:30:22.003
And why don’t you send this one
to Houston people,

01:30:22.268 --> 01:30:25.824
the one on the Easter day, will be good
idea, you see?

01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:33.284
And if he wants to hear also, Mr. Tricky
Fellow, he could, you see.

01:30:33.485 --> 01:30:39.205
No wonder, because of pressures on him,
you see?

01:30:39.451 --> 01:30:42.635
You see, that is being a cult, it will
become a cult,

01:30:42.835 --> 01:30:47.684
Unity Church will become a cult once
he starts tolerating everything.

01:30:47.885 --> 01:30:50.200
Just write to him that, “You’ll become
a cult then,

01:30:50.401 --> 01:30:53.659
you don’t become a living church.

01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:59.716
The living things know how to discard,
what to accept.”

01:31:01.082 --> 01:31:03.911
Please sit down.

01:31:07.356 --> 01:31:10.810
Yogi: Excuse me, Mother, is this light
disturbing You?

01:31:11.011 --> 01:31:13.850
Shri Mataji: This is what?
Yogi: Do you mind this light on?

01:31:14.051 --> 01:31:17.496
Shri Mataji: I didn’t see it!
Yogi: Oh.

01:31:21.481 --> 01:31:23.410
Shri Mataji: I think this gives a better
picture. Yogi: It does.

01:31:23.610 --> 01:31:27.381
Shri Mataji: It does. Yes.

01:31:30.882 --> 01:31:35.149
You can get people from say Lille have
come,

01:31:35.358 --> 01:31:39.820
who else from – London, you see,
the new people,

01:31:40.021 --> 01:31:42.462
if they don’t come forward, then how will I
know them, you see,

01:31:42.662 --> 01:31:45.219
some of the new people whom I’ve not met
should come forward,

01:31:45.419 --> 01:31:49.100
you see, will be good idea. You must tell
your names to me and…

01:31:49.301 --> 01:31:53.175
[Yogi: “Gary”]. What’s it? [Yogi: “Gary”]
Gareth. [Yogi: “Gary”]

01:31:53.376 --> 01:31:58.191
Gary, Gary, all right. Gary.

01:32:04.672 --> 01:32:08.250
Anybody else from Lille? Patrick, you can
come along.

01:32:08.450 --> 01:32:12.652
You come along – now, what’s your name?
Christopher.

01:32:12.853 --> 01:32:15.922
Christopher I don’t know. Christopher
and Gary.

01:32:16.123 --> 01:32:20.280
Now, who else is there?

01:32:20.481 --> 01:32:23.349
A new one? Come along. Patrick you
come, and you come along.

01:32:23.549 --> 01:32:28.020
You also come, because you’ve come
from outside.

01:32:30.196 --> 01:32:34.089
Hilary, is it all right? You’ve changed
a little bit, is it all right?

01:32:34.290 --> 01:32:37.045
[Yogini: “Yes, Mother”] Little bit,
because you see,

01:32:37.246 --> 01:32:39.799
it’s no use going up and down
[Yogini: “Yes”],

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.447
so is best is to finish with Norwich,
[Yogini: “Yes, Mother”]

01:32:42.648 --> 01:32:44.552
and then be in Cambridge [Yogini: “Yes”].

01:32:44.753 --> 01:32:48.722
Yogini: Mother, did I understand you were
going to spend two evenings in Cambridge,

01:32:48.923 --> 01:32:51.299
and then the puja the following day.
Shri Mataji: Yes.

01:32:51.499 --> 01:32:53.878
[Yogini: “Or is it one evening?”] No, no,
that’s how, that’s how, that’s what it is.

01:32:54.079 --> 01:32:57.026
[Yogini: “Two programmes”] 18th at Norwich
[Yogini: “Yes”]

01:32:57.227 --> 01:33:01.228
and 19th and 20th Cambridge
[Yogini: “Yes”],

01:33:01.429 --> 01:33:06.206
and 21st the Puja. 21st is a Sunday, isn’t
it? Yogini: I hope so, Mother, yes.

01:33:06.407 --> 01:33:08.769
Shri Mataji: I hope so, [Yogini: “Yes”]
because you see,

01:33:08.969 --> 01:33:11.662
some people will have to come from here
for Puja. [Yogini: “Yes, Mother”]

01:33:11.863 --> 01:33:15.880
Just find out, is it a Sunday, 21st?

01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:22.378
All right. Come along, come forward.
