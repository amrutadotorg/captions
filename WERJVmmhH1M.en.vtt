00:02:20.051 --> 00:02:23.496
[Talk in Marathi for the first
14 minutes, then in English]

00:14:47.298 --> 00:14:49.196
We have come to this place many a times,

00:14:49.397 --> 00:14:51.164
this beautiful place, you all like it.

00:14:51.365 --> 00:14:54.946
It’s very rustic, absolutely in
the interior.

00:14:55.147 --> 00:14:59.247
Only thing is, coming all the way from
Ganapatipule,

00:14:59.448 --> 00:15:02.631
you have to spend lot of time.

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:12.153
All this you are doing just to enjoy
the beauty of nature,

00:15:12.369 --> 00:15:14.966
and to be with the nature.

00:15:15.167 --> 00:15:23.920
I have told you already that this fruit
of coconut is called as Shriphala,

00:15:24.121 --> 00:15:27.959
because it is the Sahasrara,

00:15:28.159 --> 00:15:31.332
and it’s very surprising

00:15:31.532 --> 00:15:34.468
that this fruit knows and understands.

00:15:34.669 --> 00:15:39.751
It won’t fall on any animal or on any
person.

00:15:39.952 --> 00:15:42.739
If you are sleeping here, it will never
fall on you.

00:15:42.939 --> 00:15:46.392
Nobody is hurt, ever, by this fruit.

00:15:46.593 --> 00:15:50.484
It is so sensible, more than human beings,

00:15:50.684 --> 00:15:53.710
because we do hurt others, we do trouble
others,

00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:56.826
we don’t think what we are doing.

00:15:58.057 --> 00:16:03.207
But in Sahaja Yoga there’s lot of
sweetness, goodness, righteousness,

00:16:03.408 --> 00:16:06.838
and it’s so encouraging.

00:16:07.039 --> 00:16:10.139
Also so many people are there, newly
married.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.197
I congratulate them, all of them.

00:16:13.398 --> 00:16:16.253
Now try to be...

00:16:20.692 --> 00:16:22.737
Try to be kind to each other.

00:16:22.938 --> 00:16:26.438
If you are reserved in the beginning,
you’ll have to pay for it.

00:16:26.646 --> 00:16:30.570
Please try to be nice, kind and talkative;

00:16:30.771 --> 00:16:36.574
not that you just keep quiet and don’t
talk to someone.

00:16:36.781 --> 00:16:41.605
Maybe there’s sort of a way of impressing
others:

00:16:41.805 --> 00:16:43.992
not in our Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:44.193 --> 00:16:47.814
In Sahaja Yoga I talk too much, that’s why
My throat is off today,

00:16:48.015 --> 00:16:50.340
and you also talk.

00:16:50.541 --> 00:16:55.947
Talking is very important, not hiding your
feelings.

00:16:56.148 --> 00:17:00.306
I have told lots of things about it, how
to make a marriage happy,

00:17:00.507 --> 00:17:02.732
that will make [you] very happy also.

00:17:02.933 --> 00:17:07.420
If you have very good marriages we’ll have
very good children born to you,

00:17:07.621 --> 00:17:12.801
and then we’ll have a new race of people
in this world.

00:17:13.002 --> 00:17:16.416
These children will be the most powerful
things for us,

00:17:16.617 --> 00:17:18.372
and they’ll work out many things

00:17:18.572 --> 00:17:21.494
which we could not work out.

00:17:29.668 --> 00:17:35.415
Regarding our tour, I hope you have been
happy about it,

00:17:35.615 --> 00:17:39.824
and then you enjoyed all the programs
that we had.

00:17:51.584 --> 00:17:54.656
Today I am going to tell you something
about the sea,

00:17:54.857 --> 00:17:56.899
because we are next to the sea here,

00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:01.291
and must understand the feelings of a sea.

00:18:01.491 --> 00:18:04.089
Sea is your grandfather in a way,

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:12.109
because he gave birth to Lakshmi, who
becomes Mahalakshmi later on.

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:19.394
So this sea which is the grandfather, we
have to show all respect to him.

00:18:19.594 --> 00:18:28.765
Normally the way people are living, in
the West specially, also in India,

00:18:28.974 --> 00:18:34.035
people go and use it for bathrooms.

00:18:34.236 --> 00:18:37.700
But also in the West they use it in a very
funny way,

00:18:37.901 --> 00:18:43.372
that they use it for swimming and all kinds
of things,

00:18:43.589 --> 00:18:46.355
by which they wear funny dresses

00:18:46.556 --> 00:18:50.801
and lead a very licentious life.

00:18:51.002 --> 00:18:53.712
This is an insult to the sea.

00:18:53.913 --> 00:18:58.516
We must respect the sea. In India we
worship the sea.

00:18:58.735 --> 00:19:02.716
We have to worship the sea. And in
the Greek mythology also

00:19:02.917 --> 00:19:08.467
they had a, as we have Varuna, they too had
a God for sea.

00:19:08.668 --> 00:19:12.912
So this God for sea has to be worshipped,

00:19:13.113 --> 00:19:17.103
and has to be understood and to be
respected.

00:19:17.304 --> 00:19:18.979
We cannot be disrespectful.

00:19:19.187 --> 00:19:22.898
Before entering into sea you must say
namaskar to the sea,

00:19:23.099 --> 00:19:27.235
and coming out of it also you must say
namaskar.

00:19:29.567 --> 00:19:33.454
The way we behave towards the sea is not
proper.

00:19:33.655 --> 00:19:37.586
As you know, because of sea we get rain.

00:19:37.787 --> 00:19:42.419
If there was no sea we would not have
rain, we would not have anything.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.855
Sea is so important to our life.

00:19:46.056 --> 00:19:48.207
The greatest thing is, sea is the Guru,

00:19:48.408 --> 00:19:53.188
is the Mahaguru which teaches us so many
things.

00:19:53.681 --> 00:19:59.433
First of all, this Mahaguru is the one,
creates salt for us.

00:19:59.634 --> 00:20:05.713
Christ has said: “You are the salt, salt
of the universe”;

00:20:05.921 --> 00:20:10.129
meaning, you are the one which gives taste

00:20:10.329 --> 00:20:14.018
and all the qualities of the salt to
the human beings.

00:20:14.218 --> 00:20:18.070
So this sea is there, we have to learn
a lot from this sea.

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:22.575
The first of all is that it has its own
maryadas.

00:20:22.776 --> 00:20:26.781
Supposing you try to press the sea from
this side,

00:20:26.982 --> 00:20:29.061
it will appear on the other side.

00:20:29.268 --> 00:20:31.410
It always keeps to its maryadas.

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:35.763
Such a huge thing are these oceans –
are such huge,

00:20:35.963 --> 00:20:37.725
but they keep to their maryadas,

00:20:37.925 --> 00:20:41.450
they never cross their maryadas.

00:20:41.744 --> 00:20:49.051
While we just start encroaching on
everybody’s maryadas.

00:20:49.418 --> 00:20:52.038
So the maryadas of the sea is very
important –

00:20:52.255 --> 00:20:57.036
that it just keeps to its own line.

00:20:57.237 --> 00:21:00.556
You can draw the line when it is a high
tide,

00:21:00.757 --> 00:21:02.872
next day, whenever there will be a high
tide,

00:21:03.072 --> 00:21:05.791
it will be just there.

00:21:06.422 --> 00:21:09.569
So imagine such a huge thing like an ocean

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:14.257
can keep itself to the same maryadas,

00:21:14.473 --> 00:21:17.783
why can’t we, with such a personality
of ours,

00:21:17.983 --> 00:21:22.782
should keep to ourselves and to our
maryadas?

00:21:23.251 --> 00:21:28.250
Then the second quality of the sea is that
it looks after

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:31.515
all the animals that are in it.

00:21:31.715 --> 00:21:35.618
Somehow it is a saltish thing, but there
are fishes

00:21:35.819 --> 00:21:40.987
and there are all kinds of animals which
exist in the sea,

00:21:41.188 --> 00:21:43.714
and that’s why it is, we should say,

00:21:43.915 --> 00:21:48.111
the first life came into being in the sea.

00:21:48.312 --> 00:21:51.650
So all our forefathers, long time back,

00:21:51.851 --> 00:21:53.641
must have been born in the sea,

00:21:53.842 --> 00:21:56.596
and then we, now we have become human
beings.

00:21:56.797 --> 00:21:59.630
So we have no right to insult the sea,

00:21:59.831 --> 00:22:02.968
where our forefathers must have existed

00:22:03.169 --> 00:22:05.947
and then they started coming out, one
by one

00:22:06.147 --> 00:22:11.492
as the fish came, as a reptile.

00:22:13.953 --> 00:22:21.952
Now the third quality of the sea is that
it is a deep thing,

00:22:22.152 --> 00:22:26.989
it is very deep. In some places is
extremely deep.

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:30.823
If the depth of the sea is reduced

00:22:31.023 --> 00:22:39.118
even by few, few feet, there will be
problem all over.

00:22:39.318 --> 00:22:42.329
It keeps to its depth. It doesn’t leave
its depth.

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:46.783
It keeps to its maryadas, and it keeps
to its depth.

00:22:46.984 --> 00:22:49.271
In the same way, whatever depth we have got

00:22:49.471 --> 00:22:51.836
in Sahaja Yoga, we should keep to that.

00:22:52.037 --> 00:22:56.639
Normally we should not become cheap type
people,

00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:00.285
we cannot afford. We have to be deep people

00:23:00.485 --> 00:23:02.693
with deep understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

00:23:02.893 --> 00:23:04.789
deep understanding of ourselves,

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:06.990
because that’s the sign of dignity.

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:09.393
And that dignity you must have,

00:23:09.594 --> 00:23:13.802
that majestic nature of the sea you must
have.

00:23:14.003 --> 00:23:17.959
Now these trees as they are you see, are
very surprisingly,

00:23:18.159 --> 00:23:22.979
they are getting all the wind from the sea.

00:23:23.186 --> 00:23:25.910
But if you go nearer the sea when they are
planted,

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:30.017
they all bend towards the sea, never away.

00:23:30.217 --> 00:23:36.277
They give their, sort of, gratitude by
bending towards the sea.

00:23:36.478 --> 00:23:38.828
Though the wind is blowing the other way
round,

00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:40.610
but they’re not bothered about the wind.

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:44.702
Their gratitude is to the sea, so they bend
towards the sea.

00:23:44.902 --> 00:23:49.557
Even these trees understand what it is
like.

00:23:49.812 --> 00:23:52.707
Without the sea we could not have had
any transport

00:23:52.908 --> 00:23:55.313
from places to places as we have been,

00:23:55.513 --> 00:24:01.731
and also there is a great lot of wealth
inside the bed of the sea

00:24:01.932 --> 00:24:04.254
which is not yet explored; but once
explored,

00:24:04.455 --> 00:24:06.199
the whole world can be very rich.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.529
But they are fighting about it, which part
is ours,

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:12.333
which part is yours; that in that fight do
you know, I think

00:24:12.534 --> 00:24:18.687
all this inside the sea might shift from
one place to another!

00:24:18.887 --> 00:24:22.781
And lots of wealth which is of…

00:24:22.981 --> 00:24:28.156
which is like gold, silver, diamonds, are
all embedded in the sea.

00:24:28.357 --> 00:24:32.193
And one day may be that this Lakshmi might
be discovered,

00:24:32.393 --> 00:24:36.507
and we people will be enriched all over.

00:24:37.278 --> 00:24:40.034
Moreover when we carry the transport,

00:24:40.234 --> 00:24:44.456
we carry Lakshmi from one place to another,
from another place to this place,

00:24:44.657 --> 00:24:49.132
so the sea has given us that mobility and
movement.

00:24:49.792 --> 00:24:55.311
I have seen the sea reacts to Me very much.

00:24:55.512 --> 00:24:59.272
It reacts, because if there’s a light

00:24:59.473 --> 00:25:04.657
in the sea, or a moon, sun in the - moon
in the sea reflecting,

00:25:04.857 --> 00:25:07.724
it moves with Me, I’ve seen it, it moves
with Me.

00:25:07.925 --> 00:25:10.590
The sea understands Me very well,

00:25:10.791 --> 00:25:15.916
because I have a special relationship and
a respect for that sea.

00:25:16.117 --> 00:25:20.909
Now when you are here, I hope you’ll
understand the value of the sea.

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:23.479
Because of the sea you are so much enjoying
here,

00:25:23.679 --> 00:25:28.982
it is giving you such good feelings, and
all spirituality.

00:25:30.016 --> 00:25:33.503
There is no need to go to Himalayas.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.862
The – whatever is covering is in
the Himalayas,

00:25:38.062 --> 00:25:42.355
is what is nothing but the water from
the sea only.

00:25:42.556 --> 00:25:47.805
It’s one of the circles, that water passes
to the Himalayas,

00:25:48.014 --> 00:25:52.068
then comes back as rivers, again falls into
the same sea.

00:25:52.269 --> 00:25:57.853
They have to come to the sea. So it is
everything ends up here.

00:25:58.054 --> 00:26:02.972
And then it is allowed – it goes through
tapasya – it allows the Sun

00:26:03.173 --> 00:26:11.508
to create that cloud by suffering the heat,

00:26:11.708 --> 00:26:15.091
heat of the Sun, and becomes vapours,

00:26:15.291 --> 00:26:20.296
and then it goes as clouds and you get your
rain.

00:26:20.497 --> 00:26:23.403
In the same way we have to be;

00:26:23.603 --> 00:26:27.312
we have to bear the heat of others,

00:26:27.512 --> 00:26:31.507
the anger of others and create vapours –

00:26:31.708 --> 00:26:34.543
means the blessings, the vibrations for
others.

00:26:34.743 --> 00:26:36.972
It is with Me, same thing.

00:26:37.173 --> 00:26:40.405
When I see somebody who is sick and I
treat him,

00:26:40.606 --> 00:26:45.127
of course I have to bear a little bit,
sometimes quite a lot,

00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:48.887
then I absorb it and then they become
vibrations.

00:26:49.087 --> 00:26:51.332
They just start flowing as vibrations.

00:26:51.532 --> 00:26:53.503
So this is what you have to learn from
the sea,

00:26:53.704 --> 00:26:56.159
which is very important for sahaja yogis,

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.922
that you absorb everything, doesn’t matter.

00:26:59.123 --> 00:27:02.330
But don’t get attached to it, and let it
become vapours,

00:27:02.531 --> 00:27:08.686
and the Sea can now become the vapours.

00:27:08.886 --> 00:27:11.615
As you all are here, all these vapours

00:27:11.815 --> 00:27:14.205
as vibrations should flow.

00:27:14.405 --> 00:27:18.116
This method you should try to understand
by courage.

00:27:18.316 --> 00:27:21.079
Because the other day when I was coming,
there was a lady sitting

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.580
just on the way: “Mother, her feet

00:27:23.781 --> 00:27:28.460
are out of order, or something gone wrong.
Please treat her.”

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:31.057
Why should I treat? Why can’t you treat?

00:27:31.258 --> 00:27:34.306
Are you afraid to treat someone?

00:27:34.854 --> 00:27:37.555
Then there’s another one who comes up
to say: “Mother, You treat her.”

00:27:37.756 --> 00:27:39.149
Why can’t you treat?

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:42.938
You all can treat them, you can help them,

00:27:43.139 --> 00:27:47.784
and you’ll be surprised, the more you’ll
treat them the better you will be.

00:27:47.985 --> 00:27:52.292
You should venture, you should have that
much courage to treat others.

00:27:52.493 --> 00:27:56.899
If you don’t treat others you won’t grow

00:27:57.099 --> 00:28:00.891
because that is what, like the sea, as you
have seen,

00:28:01.091 --> 00:28:07.253
you become the vibrations. And when you
treat others there are more vibrations.

00:28:07.454 --> 00:28:09.248
Why should God give you vibrations

00:28:09.448 --> 00:28:13.649
if you are not going to use it? Simple
logic.

00:28:13.919 --> 00:28:18.712
Why should God give you light if you are
not going to use it?

00:28:18.912 --> 00:28:24.943
Christ has said that, “You don’t put light
under a measure.”

00:28:25.714 --> 00:28:30.140
That’s what we are doing when we are not
using our hands,

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:33.959
our feet, our brains for Sahaja Yoga:

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.909
we are not creating vibrations within
ourselves.

00:28:37.116 --> 00:28:41.168
The same body that is yours can just become
a bundle of vibrations,

00:28:41.369 --> 00:28:44.790
if you start using these vibrations.

00:28:45.513 --> 00:28:48.863
But if you don’t use these vibrations
you’ll have problems

00:28:49.071 --> 00:28:52.044
problems all the time, and you will not
understand:

00:28:52.244 --> 00:28:54.663
“Why? I am doing everything, I am doing
this” –

00:28:54.864 --> 00:28:57.637
because you are not using your vibrations.

00:28:57.838 --> 00:29:01.758
You have to use your vibrations in every
way possible,

00:29:01.959 --> 00:29:05.071
whenever is possible, to help others

00:29:05.279 --> 00:29:08.621
to get all right, to get well.

00:29:10.725 --> 00:29:12.588
You can at the most take a bandhan if you
like,

00:29:12.788 --> 00:29:15.209
if you think that it might hurt you or
something,

00:29:15.409 --> 00:29:17.655
but at least use My photograph.

00:29:17.856 --> 00:29:21.442
And after the photograph you can just touch
the person, there’s no harm.

00:29:21.643 --> 00:29:27.866
After all, if you are afraid even of any
troubles,

00:29:28.066 --> 00:29:31.497
then what’s the use of becoming a sahaja
yogi?

00:29:32.878 --> 00:29:37.052
If the ship is not seaworthy, what’s
the use of making a ship?

00:29:37.252 --> 00:29:40.141
You have to be seaworthy.

00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:45.999
And that’s what you have to decide, that:
“We are going to be Sahaja Yoga worthy,

00:29:46.199 --> 00:29:49.572
and for that we are going to absorb all
the vibrations,

00:29:49.773 --> 00:29:52.474
we are going to take up everything upon
ourselves.”

00:29:52.681 --> 00:29:55.777
Little trouble also they have, they’ll tell
Me ten times:

00:29:55.986 --> 00:29:57.957
“We went there, then this happened,

00:29:58.157 --> 00:30:00.393
then that happened, then this.”

00:30:00.594 --> 00:30:03.598
But I never tell you anything, what happens
to Me,

00:30:03.798 --> 00:30:07.426
how I came here, what was there; nothing!

00:30:07.642 --> 00:30:10.633
Because I know that all this is, whatever
I am doing,

00:30:10.834 --> 00:30:14.872
is created into vibrations. In the same way
have faith,

00:30:15.073 --> 00:30:19.328
that you are all just like the sea, like
the Mahaguru,

00:30:19.528 --> 00:30:24.254
and that whatever you are doing is creating
vibrations within you,

00:30:24.454 --> 00:30:28.170
by which you can save so many.

00:30:29.235 --> 00:30:31.967
It’s something like a cycle again, I said,

00:30:32.168 --> 00:30:35.282
that the more you give, the more you get.

00:30:35.483 --> 00:30:40.254
The more you use your vibrations, much more
you’ll get it.

00:30:40.455 --> 00:30:47.014
It’s a very nice cycle that is acting as it
has acted in the case of the sea,

00:30:47.215 --> 00:30:50.689
as I told you, that the water goes
to the Himalayas,

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:54.222
comes back at rivers. In the same way

00:30:54.423 --> 00:30:59.624
manifold, manifold your vibrations will be
growing,

00:30:59.824 --> 00:31:04.365
and I would say that we should always use
our vibrations

00:31:04.565 --> 00:31:10.917
for helping others, for giving to many
things, to the plant, to the anything.

00:31:11.124 --> 00:31:12.979
I mean there were some people who brought
a plant:

00:31:13.179 --> 00:31:17.682
“Mother, give vibrations to that.” I said:
“Why don’t you give the vibrations?”

00:31:17.883 --> 00:31:19.811
There’s no need even to take vibrated
water.

00:31:20.011 --> 00:31:23.367
You can vibrate yourself. That state has
to come,

00:31:23.568 --> 00:31:26.008
that you can vibrate your own water,

00:31:26.208 --> 00:31:28.062
you can vibrate the whole waters
everywhere,

00:31:28.263 --> 00:31:30.440
there’s no need to take vibrated water
from Me.

00:31:30.641 --> 00:31:35.187
Maybe Mine is a little more, but doesn’t
matter!

00:31:43.314 --> 00:31:47.564
But you are so many, so what – compared
to Me, I’m only one.

00:31:47.765 --> 00:31:50.569
So all of you can work it out and do such
a lot;

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:53.125
but have faith in yourself.

00:31:53.326 --> 00:31:55.019
As the sea has faith in itself,

00:31:55.219 --> 00:31:57.545
you should have complete faith in yourself.

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.732
You must respect your Self Realization.

00:32:00.932 --> 00:32:04.758
Tell every day to yourself: “I am a sahaja
yogi.

00:32:04.959 --> 00:32:07.396
I am a yogi, I am a saint,

00:32:07.597 --> 00:32:11.791
I am a realised soul. I have to do this.

00:32:11.991 --> 00:32:15.994
How can I do these other nonsensical
things? I have to do these good things.

00:32:16.194 --> 00:32:18.994
I have to talk to people in a sweet manner,

00:32:19.195 --> 00:32:23.509
I have to try to work it out this way.”

00:32:24.272 --> 00:32:31.890
It is actually your faith in yourself is
going to help.

00:32:32.091 --> 00:32:35.078
Your faith in yourself – that you are
a great sahaja yogi,

00:32:35.278 --> 00:32:40.751
that you are absolutely surrendered to your
Mother, works very fast.

00:32:40.959 --> 00:32:43.736
That faith you should have, that you are
a sahaja yogi.

00:32:43.937 --> 00:32:46.375
Nothing else is needed.

00:32:46.576 --> 00:32:49.051
May God bless you all.
