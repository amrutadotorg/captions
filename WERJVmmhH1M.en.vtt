02:20.051 --> 02:23.496
[Talk in Marathi for the first
14 minutes, then in English]

14:47.298 --> 14:49.196
We have come to this place many a times,

14:49.397 --> 14:51.164
this beautiful place, you all like it.

14:51.365 --> 14:54.946
It’s very rustic, absolutely in
the interior.

14:55.147 --> 14:59.247
Only thing is, coming all the way from
Ganapatipule,

14:59.448 --> 15:02.631
you have to spend lot of time.

15:03.710 --> 15:12.153
All this you are doing just to enjoy
the beauty of nature,

15:12.369 --> 15:14.966
and to be with the nature.

15:15.167 --> 15:23.920
I have told you already that this fruit
of coconut is called as Shriphala,

15:24.121 --> 15:27.959
because it is the Sahasrara,

15:28.159 --> 15:31.332
and it’s very surprising

15:31.532 --> 15:34.468
that this fruit knows and understands.

15:34.669 --> 15:39.751
It won’t fall on any animal or on any
person.

15:39.952 --> 15:42.739
If you are sleeping here, it will never
fall on you.

15:42.939 --> 15:46.392
Nobody is hurt, ever, by this fruit.

15:46.593 --> 15:50.484
It is so sensible, more than human beings,

15:50.684 --> 15:53.710
because we do hurt others, we do trouble
others,

15:53.911 --> 15:56.826
we don’t think what we are doing.

15:58.057 --> 16:03.207
But in Sahaja Yoga there’s lot of
sweetness, goodness, righteousness,

16:03.408 --> 16:06.838
and it’s so encouraging.

16:07.039 --> 16:10.139
Also so many people are there, newly
married.

16:10.340 --> 16:13.197
I congratulate them, all of them.

16:13.398 --> 16:16.253
Now try to be...

16:20.692 --> 16:22.737
Try to be kind to each other.

16:22.938 --> 16:26.438
If you are reserved in the beginning,
you’ll have to pay for it.

16:26.646 --> 16:30.570
Please try to be nice, kind and talkative;

16:30.771 --> 16:36.574
not that you just keep quiet and don’t
talk to someone.

16:36.781 --> 16:41.605
Maybe there’s sort of a way of impressing
others:

16:41.805 --> 16:43.992
not in our Sahaja Yoga.

16:44.193 --> 16:47.814
In Sahaja Yoga I talk too much, that’s why
My throat is off today,

16:48.015 --> 16:50.340
and you also talk.

16:50.541 --> 16:55.947
Talking is very important, not hiding your
feelings.

16:56.148 --> 17:00.306
I have told lots of things about it, how
to make a marriage happy,

17:00.507 --> 17:02.732
that will make [you] very happy also.

17:02.933 --> 17:07.420
If you have very good marriages we’ll have
very good children born to you,

17:07.621 --> 17:12.801
and then we’ll have a new race of people
in this world.

17:13.002 --> 17:16.416
These children will be the most powerful
things for us,

17:16.617 --> 17:18.372
and they’ll work out many things

17:18.572 --> 17:21.494
which we could not work out.

17:29.668 --> 17:35.415
Regarding our tour, I hope you have been
happy about it,

17:35.615 --> 17:39.824
and then you enjoyed all the programs
that we had.

17:51.584 --> 17:54.656
Today I am going to tell you something
about the sea,

17:54.857 --> 17:56.899
because we are next to the sea here,

17:57.100 --> 18:01.291
and must understand the feelings of a sea.

18:01.491 --> 18:04.089
Sea is your grandfather in a way,

18:04.290 --> 18:12.109
because he gave birth to Lakshmi, who
becomes Mahalakshmi later on.

18:12.310 --> 18:19.394
So this sea which is the grandfather, we
have to show all respect to him.

18:19.594 --> 18:28.765
Normally the way people are living, in
the West specially, also in India,

18:28.974 --> 18:34.035
people go and use it for bathrooms.

18:34.236 --> 18:37.700
But also in the West they use it in a very
funny way,

18:37.901 --> 18:43.372
that they use it for swimming and all kinds
of things,

18:43.589 --> 18:46.355
by which they wear funny dresses

18:46.556 --> 18:50.801
and lead a very licentious life.

18:51.002 --> 18:53.712
This is an insult to the sea.

18:53.913 --> 18:58.516
We must respect the sea. In India we
worship the sea.

18:58.735 --> 19:02.716
We have to worship the sea. And in
the Greek mythology also

19:02.917 --> 19:08.467
they had a, as we have Varuna, they too had
a God for sea.

19:08.668 --> 19:12.912
So this God for sea has to be worshipped,

19:13.113 --> 19:17.103
and has to be understood and to be
respected.

19:17.304 --> 19:18.979
We cannot be disrespectful.

19:19.187 --> 19:22.898
Before entering into sea you must say
namaskar to the sea,

19:23.099 --> 19:27.235
and coming out of it also you must say
namaskar.

19:29.567 --> 19:33.454
The way we behave towards the sea is not
proper.

19:33.655 --> 19:37.586
As you know, because of sea we get rain.

19:37.787 --> 19:42.419
If there was no sea we would not have
rain, we would not have anything.

19:42.620 --> 19:45.855
Sea is so important to our life.

19:46.056 --> 19:48.207
The greatest thing is, sea is the Guru,

19:48.408 --> 19:53.188
is the Mahaguru which teaches us so many
things.

19:53.681 --> 19:59.433
First of all, this Mahaguru is the one,
creates salt for us.

19:59.634 --> 20:05.713
Christ has said: “You are the salt, salt
of the universe”;

20:05.921 --> 20:10.129
meaning, you are the one which gives taste

20:10.329 --> 20:14.018
and all the qualities of the salt to
the human beings.

20:14.218 --> 20:18.070
So this sea is there, we have to learn
a lot from this sea.

20:18.270 --> 20:22.575
The first of all is that it has its own
maryadas.

20:22.776 --> 20:26.781
Supposing you try to press the sea from
this side,

20:26.982 --> 20:29.061
it will appear on the other side.

20:29.268 --> 20:31.410
It always keeps to its maryadas.

20:31.610 --> 20:35.763
Such a huge thing are these oceans –
are such huge,

20:35.963 --> 20:37.725
but they keep to their maryadas,

20:37.925 --> 20:41.450
they never cross their maryadas.

20:41.744 --> 20:49.051
While we just start encroaching on
everybody’s maryadas.

20:49.418 --> 20:52.038
So the maryadas of the sea is very
important –

20:52.255 --> 20:57.036
that it just keeps to its own line.

20:57.237 --> 21:00.556
You can draw the line when it is a high
tide,

21:00.757 --> 21:02.872
next day, whenever there will be a high
tide,

21:03.072 --> 21:05.791
it will be just there.

21:06.422 --> 21:09.569
So imagine such a huge thing like an ocean

21:09.770 --> 21:14.257
can keep itself to the same maryadas,

21:14.473 --> 21:17.783
why can’t we, with such a personality
of ours,

21:17.983 --> 21:22.782
should keep to ourselves and to our
maryadas?

21:23.251 --> 21:28.250
Then the second quality of the sea is that
it looks after

21:28.450 --> 21:31.515
all the animals that are in it.

21:31.715 --> 21:35.618
Somehow it is a saltish thing, but there
are fishes

21:35.819 --> 21:40.987
and there are all kinds of animals which
exist in the sea,

21:41.188 --> 21:43.714
and that’s why it is, we should say,

21:43.915 --> 21:48.111
the first life came into being in the sea.

21:48.312 --> 21:51.650
So all our forefathers, long time back,

21:51.851 --> 21:53.641
must have been born in the sea,

21:53.842 --> 21:56.596
and then we, now we have become human
beings.

21:56.797 --> 21:59.630
So we have no right to insult the sea,

21:59.831 --> 22:02.968
where our forefathers must have existed

22:03.169 --> 22:05.947
and then they started coming out, one
by one

22:06.147 --> 22:11.492
as the fish came, as a reptile.

22:13.953 --> 22:21.952
Now the third quality of the sea is that
it is a deep thing,

22:22.152 --> 22:26.989
it is very deep. In some places is
extremely deep.

22:27.190 --> 22:30.823
If the depth of the sea is reduced

22:31.023 --> 22:39.118
even by few, few feet, there will be
problem all over.

22:39.318 --> 22:42.329
It keeps to its depth. It doesn’t leave
its depth.

22:42.530 --> 22:46.783
It keeps to its maryadas, and it keeps
to its depth.

22:46.984 --> 22:49.271
In the same way, whatever depth we have got

22:49.471 --> 22:51.836
in Sahaja Yoga, we should keep to that.

22:52.037 --> 22:56.639
Normally we should not become cheap type
people,

22:56.840 --> 23:00.285
we cannot afford. We have to be deep people

23:00.485 --> 23:02.693
with deep understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

23:02.893 --> 23:04.789
deep understanding of ourselves,

23:04.990 --> 23:06.990
because that’s the sign of dignity.

23:07.190 --> 23:09.393
And that dignity you must have,

23:09.594 --> 23:13.802
that majestic nature of the sea you must
have.

23:14.003 --> 23:17.959
Now these trees as they are you see, are
very surprisingly,

23:18.159 --> 23:22.979
they are getting all the wind from the sea.

23:23.186 --> 23:25.910
But if you go nearer the sea when they are
planted,

23:26.110 --> 23:30.017
they all bend towards the sea, never away.

23:30.217 --> 23:36.277
They give their, sort of, gratitude by
bending towards the sea.

23:36.478 --> 23:38.828
Though the wind is blowing the other way
round,

23:39.029 --> 23:40.610
but they’re not bothered about the wind.

23:40.810 --> 23:44.702
Their gratitude is to the sea, so they bend
towards the sea.

23:44.902 --> 23:49.557
Even these trees understand what it is
like.

23:49.812 --> 23:52.707
Without the sea we could not have had
any transport

23:52.908 --> 23:55.313
from places to places as we have been,

23:55.513 --> 24:01.731
and also there is a great lot of wealth
inside the bed of the sea

24:01.932 --> 24:04.254
which is not yet explored; but once
explored,

24:04.455 --> 24:06.199
the whole world can be very rich.

24:06.400 --> 24:08.529
But they are fighting about it, which part
is ours,

24:08.730 --> 24:12.333
which part is yours; that in that fight do
you know, I think

24:12.534 --> 24:18.687
all this inside the sea might shift from
one place to another!

24:18.887 --> 24:22.781
And lots of wealth which is of…

24:22.981 --> 24:28.156
which is like gold, silver, diamonds, are
all embedded in the sea.

24:28.357 --> 24:32.193
And one day may be that this Lakshmi might
be discovered,

24:32.393 --> 24:36.507
and we people will be enriched all over.

24:37.278 --> 24:40.034
Moreover when we carry the transport,

24:40.234 --> 24:44.456
we carry Lakshmi from one place to another,
from another place to this place,

24:44.657 --> 24:49.132
so the sea has given us that mobility and
movement.

24:49.792 --> 24:55.311
I have seen the sea reacts to Me very much.

24:55.512 --> 24:59.272
It reacts, because if there’s a light

24:59.473 --> 25:04.657
in the sea, or a moon, sun in the - moon
in the sea reflecting,

25:04.857 --> 25:07.724
it moves with Me, I’ve seen it, it moves
with Me.

25:07.925 --> 25:10.590
The sea understands Me very well,

25:10.791 --> 25:15.916
because I have a special relationship and
a respect for that sea.

25:16.117 --> 25:20.909
Now when you are here, I hope you’ll
understand the value of the sea.

25:21.110 --> 25:23.479
Because of the sea you are so much enjoying
here,

25:23.679 --> 25:28.982
it is giving you such good feelings, and
all spirituality.

25:30.016 --> 25:33.503
There is no need to go to Himalayas.

25:34.960 --> 25:37.862
The – whatever is covering is in
the Himalayas,

25:38.062 --> 25:42.355
is what is nothing but the water from
the sea only.

25:42.556 --> 25:47.805
It’s one of the circles, that water passes
to the Himalayas,

25:48.014 --> 25:52.068
then comes back as rivers, again falls into
the same sea.

25:52.269 --> 25:57.853
They have to come to the sea. So it is
everything ends up here.

25:58.054 --> 26:02.972
And then it is allowed – it goes through
tapasya – it allows the Sun

26:03.173 --> 26:11.508
to create that cloud by suffering the heat,

26:11.708 --> 26:15.091
heat of the Sun, and becomes vapours,

26:15.291 --> 26:20.296
and then it goes as clouds and you get your
rain.

26:20.497 --> 26:23.403
In the same way we have to be;

26:23.603 --> 26:27.312
we have to bear the heat of others,

26:27.512 --> 26:31.507
the anger of others and create vapours –

26:31.708 --> 26:34.543
means the blessings, the vibrations for
others.

26:34.743 --> 26:36.972
It is with Me, same thing.

26:37.173 --> 26:40.405
When I see somebody who is sick and I
treat him,

26:40.606 --> 26:45.127
of course I have to bear a little bit,
sometimes quite a lot,

26:45.437 --> 26:48.887
then I absorb it and then they become
vibrations.

26:49.087 --> 26:51.332
They just start flowing as vibrations.

26:51.532 --> 26:53.503
So this is what you have to learn from
the sea,

26:53.704 --> 26:56.159
which is very important for sahaja yogis,

26:56.360 --> 26:58.922
that you absorb everything, doesn’t matter.

26:59.123 --> 27:02.330
But don’t get attached to it, and let it
become vapours,

27:02.531 --> 27:08.686
and the Sea can now become the vapours.

27:08.886 --> 27:11.615
As you all are here, all these vapours

27:11.815 --> 27:14.205
as vibrations should flow.

27:14.405 --> 27:18.116
This method you should try to understand
by courage.

27:18.316 --> 27:21.079
Because the other day when I was coming,
there was a lady sitting

27:21.280 --> 27:23.580
just on the way: “Mother, her feet

27:23.781 --> 27:28.460
are out of order, or something gone wrong.
Please treat her.”

27:28.730 --> 27:31.057
Why should I treat? Why can’t you treat?

27:31.258 --> 27:34.306
Are you afraid to treat someone?

27:34.854 --> 27:37.555
Then there’s another one who comes up
to say: “Mother, You treat her.”

27:37.756 --> 27:39.149
Why can’t you treat?

27:39.350 --> 27:42.938
You all can treat them, you can help them,

27:43.139 --> 27:47.784
and you’ll be surprised, the more you’ll
treat them the better you will be.

27:47.985 --> 27:52.292
You should venture, you should have that
much courage to treat others.

27:52.493 --> 27:56.899
If you don’t treat others you won’t grow

27:57.099 --> 28:00.891
because that is what, like the sea, as you
have seen,

28:01.091 --> 28:07.253
you become the vibrations. And when you
treat others there are more vibrations.

28:07.454 --> 28:09.248
Why should God give you vibrations

28:09.448 --> 28:13.649
if you are not going to use it? Simple
logic.

28:13.919 --> 28:18.712
Why should God give you light if you are
not going to use it?

28:18.912 --> 28:24.943
Christ has said that, “You don’t put light
under a measure.”

28:25.714 --> 28:30.140
That’s what we are doing when we are not
using our hands,

28:30.340 --> 28:33.959
our feet, our brains for Sahaja Yoga:

28:34.160 --> 28:36.909
we are not creating vibrations within
ourselves.

28:37.116 --> 28:41.168
The same body that is yours can just become
a bundle of vibrations,

28:41.369 --> 28:44.790
if you start using these vibrations.

28:45.513 --> 28:48.863
But if you don’t use these vibrations
you’ll have problems

28:49.071 --> 28:52.044
problems all the time, and you will not
understand:

28:52.244 --> 28:54.663
“Why? I am doing everything, I am doing
this” –

28:54.864 --> 28:57.637
because you are not using your vibrations.

28:57.838 --> 29:01.758
You have to use your vibrations in every
way possible,

29:01.959 --> 29:05.071
whenever is possible, to help others

29:05.279 --> 29:08.621
to get all right, to get well.

29:10.725 --> 29:12.588
You can at the most take a bandhan if you
like,

29:12.788 --> 29:15.209
if you think that it might hurt you or
something,

29:15.409 --> 29:17.655
but at least use My photograph.

29:17.856 --> 29:21.442
And after the photograph you can just touch
the person, there’s no harm.

29:21.643 --> 29:27.866
After all, if you are afraid even of any
troubles,

29:28.066 --> 29:31.497
then what’s the use of becoming a sahaja
yogi?

29:32.878 --> 29:37.052
If the ship is not seaworthy, what’s
the use of making a ship?

29:37.252 --> 29:40.141
You have to be seaworthy.

29:41.650 --> 29:45.999
And that’s what you have to decide, that:
“We are going to be Sahaja Yoga worthy,

29:46.199 --> 29:49.572
and for that we are going to absorb all
the vibrations,

29:49.773 --> 29:52.474
we are going to take up everything upon
ourselves.”

29:52.681 --> 29:55.777
Little trouble also they have, they’ll tell
Me ten times:

29:55.986 --> 29:57.957
“We went there, then this happened,

29:58.157 --> 30:00.393
then that happened, then this.”

30:00.594 --> 30:03.598
But I never tell you anything, what happens
to Me,

30:03.798 --> 30:07.426
how I came here, what was there; nothing!

30:07.642 --> 30:10.633
Because I know that all this is, whatever
I am doing,

30:10.834 --> 30:14.872
is created into vibrations. In the same way
have faith,

30:15.073 --> 30:19.328
that you are all just like the sea, like
the Mahaguru,

30:19.528 --> 30:24.254
and that whatever you are doing is creating
vibrations within you,

30:24.454 --> 30:28.170
by which you can save so many.

30:29.235 --> 30:31.967
It’s something like a cycle again, I said,

30:32.168 --> 30:35.282
that the more you give, the more you get.

30:35.483 --> 30:40.254
The more you use your vibrations, much more
you’ll get it.

30:40.455 --> 30:47.014
It’s a very nice cycle that is acting as it
has acted in the case of the sea,

30:47.215 --> 30:50.689
as I told you, that the water goes
to the Himalayas,

30:50.890 --> 30:54.222
comes back at rivers. In the same way

30:54.423 --> 30:59.624
manifold, manifold your vibrations will be
growing,

30:59.824 --> 31:04.365
and I would say that we should always use
our vibrations

31:04.565 --> 31:10.917
for helping others, for giving to many
things, to the plant, to the anything.

31:11.124 --> 31:12.979
I mean there were some people who brought
a plant:

31:13.179 --> 31:17.682
“Mother, give vibrations to that.” I said:
“Why don’t you give the vibrations?”

31:17.883 --> 31:19.811
There’s no need even to take vibrated
water.

31:20.011 --> 31:23.367
You can vibrate yourself. That state has
to come,

31:23.568 --> 31:26.008
that you can vibrate your own water,

31:26.208 --> 31:28.062
you can vibrate the whole waters
everywhere,

31:28.263 --> 31:30.440
there’s no need to take vibrated water
from Me.

31:30.641 --> 31:35.187
Maybe Mine is a little more, but doesn’t
matter!

31:43.314 --> 31:47.564
But you are so many, so what – compared
to Me, I’m only one.

31:47.765 --> 31:50.569
So all of you can work it out and do such
a lot;

31:50.770 --> 31:53.125
but have faith in yourself.

31:53.326 --> 31:55.019
As the sea has faith in itself,

31:55.219 --> 31:57.545
you should have complete faith in yourself.

31:57.760 --> 32:00.732
You must respect your Self Realization.

32:00.932 --> 32:04.758
Tell every day to yourself: “I am a sahaja
yogi.

32:04.959 --> 32:07.396
I am a yogi, I am a saint,

32:07.597 --> 32:11.791
I am a realised soul. I have to do this.

32:11.991 --> 32:15.994
How can I do these other nonsensical
things? I have to do these good things.

32:16.194 --> 32:18.994
I have to talk to people in a sweet manner,

32:19.195 --> 32:23.509
I have to try to work it out this way.”

32:24.272 --> 32:31.890
It is actually your faith in yourself is
going to help.

32:32.091 --> 32:35.078
Your faith in yourself – that you are
a great sahaja yogi,

32:35.278 --> 32:40.751
that you are absolutely surrendered to your
Mother, works very fast.

32:40.959 --> 32:43.736
That faith you should have, that you are
a sahaja yogi.

32:43.937 --> 32:46.375
Nothing else is needed.

32:46.576 --> 32:49.051
May God bless you all.
