26:27.320 --> 26:29.200
Y:(...) You did? From where?

26:30.840 --> 26:33.080
Which? where? Did you go to Scotland For that?

26:33.600 --> 26:34.800
Yogi: No in england.

26:35.120 --> 26:35.920
In England, where?

26:39.240 --> 26:41.240
In London, in ..... Where? Y: London.

26:42.640 --> 26:47.440
Y: I did it in London and also did ...

26:47.720 --> 26:48.240
What?

26:54.360 --> 26:58.640
The name of the company in L....

26:59.320 --> 27:03.400
SM: Poor thing. Y:(...)

27:05.800 --> 27:08.200
We have a deputy director, Who, What is that?

27:09.240 --> 27:12.480
What is he talking about?

27:16.560 --> 27:20.240
Aah..Y:(...) SM: Poor thing.

27:22.200 --> 27:23.520
They have really.

27:25.720 --> 27:30.680
Y: The flying technique ....

27:31.440 --> 27:33.880
I have done the flying but could never fly.

27:40.280 --> 27:42.600
He was in charge of that , this one is sitting here.

27:43.520 --> 27:45.680
He was in charge in Scott land.

27:46.680 --> 27:49.480
No its wrong,It's nonsense, It's not true.

27:49.880 --> 27:52.560
Y: I comes true, how did I swollen myself.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.440
They were doing practicing of same techniques

27:55.960 --> 27:57.480
which I was but I didn't fly but they did.

27:57.840 --> 28:00.040
So they were just jumping like you can jump on a horse.

28:00.440 --> 28:02.280
I saw them going up.

28:03.040 --> 28:05.120
No. Can not.Y: (...)

28:06.080 --> 28:07.320
It's only mesmerism.

28:08.160 --> 28:11.080
With that one can see anything, one feel like, but I

28:11.280 --> 28:14.200
Y: (...)

28:15.240 --> 28:17.360
They were not going up, you see what happens that

28:17.840 --> 28:20.440
They have foreman all that , they were made to jump and jump jump

28:21.200 --> 28:22.600
So you develop a kind of a ...

28:23.200 --> 28:26.080
They they were sitting, they couldn't jump.

28:30.960 --> 28:34.040
See the gentleman who was doing this, teaching this is here.

28:35.280 --> 28:37.880
Flying technique, and he end up with

28:38.600 --> 28:41.280
nothing but epilepsy

28:41.480 --> 28:44.960
We have to recognise him

28:45.360 --> 28:48.120
He was deputy director of the technique.

28:49.320 --> 28:50.640
And it was all falls.

28:53.640 --> 28:54.840
Y: But I don't see it.

28:57.560 --> 28:59.920
You see what happens that they are spirits.

29:00.840 --> 29:03.120
and they just give you a sought of a jump.

29:03.720 --> 29:06.680
That's all, we have people they came for My program

29:07.400 --> 29:10.400
and suddenly they started jumping.Now I said,This is too much.

29:10.600 --> 29:12.440
Because you see everybody started running up.

29:13.320 --> 29:14.440
from that mad crowd.

29:14.800 --> 29:15.600
We had a Ashram.

29:16.240 --> 29:19.200
There they came just screaming you see, even looking at Me

29:19.640 --> 29:21.920
They would just jump from here to there.

29:23.960 --> 29:26.160
And screaming and shouting, you see there are people,

29:26.400 --> 29:28.120
nearby said, we can't have this Ashram

29:29.160 --> 29:30.680
Some sought of a black magic is going on.

29:31.040 --> 29:32.920
They brought such a bad name poor.

29:33.400 --> 29:34.240
See My point.

29:35.200 --> 29:36.960
Is not jumping, it's just a spirit that

29:37.400 --> 29:39.400
throws you off for while, that's not jumping.

29:40.120 --> 29:41.640
That's what, what you call.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.240
Beg a pardon, You this approve this.

29:50.120 --> 29:51.520
Now you just tell Me, you are a reasonable man

29:52.000 --> 29:54.240
How can I approve of such a non sense as that.

29:54.840 --> 29:57.480
We are going to become birds now or something high.

29:59.640 --> 30:00.400
Do you understand?

30:00.920 --> 30:02.800
Not only disapprove but condemn it.

30:04.080 --> 30:06.320
Horrible thing they have done, money making proposition.

30:07.160 --> 30:09.960
And be fool.Y: Money making.SM: and be fooling, both thing.

30:10.880 --> 30:12.760
How much money this man has made, do you know?

30:14.120 --> 30:16.160
You are too simple and naive to understand

30:16.640 --> 30:17.960
And the treachery.... of these people.

30:20.360 --> 30:21.640
It's all money making.

30:24.040 --> 30:26.880
Simple as that and be fooled.

30:31.240 --> 30:33.360
Don't get upset but it is.

30:34.600 --> 30:35.640
Absolutely that.

30:38.160 --> 30:40.280
You reach no where, it's all telling lies.

30:41.040 --> 30:42.040
One after another,

30:42.560 --> 30:44.560
The director, who was here, now he has gone to Africa,

30:45.040 --> 30:46.760
he told Me, not this, this is deputy director.

30:47.680 --> 30:48.960
The director was another fellow.

30:49.520 --> 30:51.560
And his wife is here out, so she has come?

30:53.280 --> 30:55.400
Linda. she isn't come today, all right.

30:56.520 --> 30:58.080
You should meet them and they will tell you all the stories,

30:58.600 --> 31:00.080
what there, they have been there, they are in charge

31:00.480 --> 31:01.760
I mean, He was the one, who was running the academy.

31:02.400 --> 31:05.760
His wife and he use to tell people

31:06.200 --> 31:07.000
that I walk through the walls

31:07.360 --> 31:09.480
I said, "But why did you say such a thing?

31:13.280 --> 31:16.280
Also that technique suitable for bare player.

31:19.560 --> 31:21.840
But that technique doesn't work out, it's falls hood.

31:22.240 --> 31:23.480
What I am trying to tell you,

31:23.840 --> 31:26.240
I said, "Why did you tell them lies?They were asked to tell.

31:26.720 --> 31:28.400
They said, "Unless and until you tell the people,

31:28.920 --> 31:31.040
The people are not going to believe you and this won't run.

31:31.600 --> 31:33.560
Big money was involves of this man.

31:34.320 --> 31:36.720
So he started telling lies and he confessed it.

31:37.800 --> 31:38.680
Absolutely

31:39.240 --> 31:41.680
Y: Who is the in charge now? SM: is now Peter Peers.

31:42.680 --> 31:44.640
And his wife is still there in England.

31:45.440 --> 31:47.360
I thing, she will come some, you will meet her some time.

31:47.840 --> 31:49.640
All right, So you meet them and they will tell you all the,

31:49.960 --> 31:51.920
They will tell you all the tricks, what they were trying to do.

31:52.680 --> 31:53.840
These are all the tricks.

31:54.880 --> 31:56.200
Now you want the real or not.

31:56.960 --> 31:57.840
Or some tricks like that.

31:58.360 --> 32:03.120
Y: What are the is like here before hearing what they did.

32:03.320 --> 32:06.400
The way they charged money and all and

32:06.840 --> 32:10.040
they deny to people who do enough for,

32:10.600 --> 32:12.960
You see, that is one of the thing one should think.

32:13.560 --> 32:15.360
always that you can't play for God.

32:16.520 --> 32:19.040
If it is your ascent in spirituality

32:19.520 --> 32:21.680
It is a natural thing spontaneous.

32:22.360 --> 32:24.480
It's within you, and you can't pay for God.

32:24.960 --> 32:27.800
But you see, People and human being can't understand God.

32:28.680 --> 32:31.080
It's beyond them to see this point

32:32.160 --> 32:34.120
because they have seen Churches taking money,

32:34.960 --> 32:36.680
temples taking money, everybody taking money,

32:37.080 --> 32:38.680
When they think these are another type, you see

32:39.280 --> 32:41.120
But if you have to have an alternative for that

32:41.800 --> 32:43.120
that should be at least

32:44.360 --> 32:46.240
Free for you, it should be free for everyone.

32:48.120 --> 32:48.960
That's not the only point,

32:49.480 --> 32:50.960
it's much worse then that you will know that.

32:53.080 --> 32:53.760
On top of your head,

32:54.080 --> 32:56.080
just to, no no, on top of your head, all right

32:56.600 --> 32:59.320
tap it on. on top of your head.

32:59.840 --> 33:03.560
Just on your Sahasrara, Yes yes, just in front.

33:05.400 --> 33:06.240
It seems to be cool.

33:12.080 --> 33:13.120
And look at your own condition

33:14.720 --> 33:17.280
You see the, you should see the people, how they have become.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.200
Just put it on his head, little bit,

33:24.680 --> 33:25.920
little bit with your own hand.

33:26.880 --> 33:27.680
Will be better

33:30.040 --> 33:31.680
Just or let him do himself.

33:32.280 --> 33:33.800
Little bit,

33:34.200 --> 33:36.960
already he has got cold, or let him drink that water.

33:37.200 --> 33:40.320
Water would be better, he is all void caught up,

33:41.040 --> 33:42.960
his left side caught up, he is very very left sided

33:48.880 --> 33:50.160
It's going to take time to get all right,

33:50.600 --> 33:52.200
All right, if you want you can drink it.

33:56.520 --> 33:59.320
Now it's better, better?

34:00.200 --> 34:01.960
Burning is there but the rest is all right.

34:14.240 --> 34:15.560
They take advantage

34:17.400 --> 34:21.280
For icing now you just mix it up in there, little bit in that oil.

34:26.760 --> 34:29.040
Y: (...) SM: that is, all that,

34:33.240 --> 34:34.720
..with your finger.

34:45.960 --> 34:49.960
Y: (...)

34:50.440 --> 34:52.960
They don't dissolve and it should become powder.

35:00.240 --> 35:01.880
They are becoming. Y: Yes.

35:08.880 --> 35:11.840
Yes, better now, how is he, Is he better now?

35:12.640 --> 35:14.960
Just very very hot in the left.

35:15.680 --> 35:18.160
Poor thing. Walter, where has he been?

35:18.880 --> 35:19.920
He has been to everywhere.

35:20.640 --> 35:21.320
No wonder.

35:25.400 --> 35:28.640
Is he all right tor he has some problem.

35:34.640 --> 35:38.160
Natural .....super natural

35:39.520 --> 35:43.400
Super natural and ES ESP astrology.

35:52.080 --> 35:54.040
I mean whats the use of super natural

35:54.640 --> 35:56.680
that we can't even keep good health, minimum.

35:58.840 --> 36:00.560
You see we should ask ourselves a question.

36:01.440 --> 36:03.720
At least our health should be all right, it's all right now.

36:05.760 --> 36:07.480
It's better, keep him his eyes open.

36:08.440 --> 36:10.160
You see getting vibrations on top of his head.

36:13.280 --> 36:15.040
We can move right to the left.

36:16.880 --> 36:18.320
He is all right. Are you all right now?

36:18.640 --> 36:21.760
Are you feeling cool breeze in the hand or not?

36:22.360 --> 36:24.880
Now keep it up, you are all right. Give him a bandhan.

36:39.680 --> 36:41.960
So twenty one years of this so what is your age now.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.160
Yes, Secret

36:47.400 --> 36:49.560
My age has a secret.

36:50.480 --> 36:51.760
Secret? For What?

36:52.400 --> 36:53.720
I don't wa..a

36:54.720 --> 36:56.760
I have ... to keep my age secret.

36:57.200 --> 36:59.800
All right.Y:(...)

37:00.600 --> 37:02.440
No it's all right, whatever you say.

37:04.720 --> 37:07.480
Because that's why I was thinking you were worried about time, why?

37:08.680 --> 37:11.280
I found that to play this (mahari)

37:11.560 --> 37:14.000
she's program takes  an awful lot of time

37:14.520 --> 37:15.760
But no one has gained anything.

37:16.320 --> 37:18.480
Y:, I beg a pardon. SM, But nobody has gained anything.

37:20.600 --> 37:23.080
Y: (...)

37:24.480 --> 37:25.720
That's how they propagate.

37:26.960 --> 37:28.520
They have a very good propaganda.

37:30.040 --> 37:31.280
But they are caught up some times.

37:32.560 --> 37:34.000
One day they were saying that

37:34.920 --> 37:37.360
they tried to take the X-ray of  people

37:38.360 --> 37:39.800
of the brain and they found

37:40.360 --> 37:41.640
there are theta rays coming out of it.

37:43.120 --> 37:44.800
So one of the Doctor who was there

37:45.080 --> 37:47.040
was a Sahaja Yogi, he caught up and he said,

37:47.920 --> 37:50.120
Theta rays only shows that the person is epileptic.

37:51.200 --> 37:52.760
and they did not know, where to look?

37:53.440 --> 37:54.760
Really what they gave you epilepsy.

37:55.520 --> 37:58.440
That's the only thing, you end up with epilepsy.

37:59.320 --> 38:00.240
That's the end of TM.

38:04.520 --> 38:06.720
It's good, I must say but he is a great seeker.

38:08.480 --> 38:10.360
All right, now put your hand, now one thing is

38:10.760 --> 38:13.240
that TM people ask too many questions and they take time.

38:13.800 --> 38:15.160
So just don't ask any question.

38:15.640 --> 38:17.240
First your realization, all right.

38:18.840 --> 38:20.320
Put some TM with him, thatâ€™s better.

38:20.840 --> 38:23.080
Will you look after him? All right, come along.

38:24.200 --> 38:26.720
you come this side, he will look after you, the deputy director.

38:30.360 --> 38:33.680
How is now? Ya, just come here.

38:35.160 --> 38:37.800
It's better that you you you stay with him.

38:38.320 --> 38:39.160
I mean you understand him,

38:39.680 --> 38:41.360
he will tell you better, he knows all things,

38:41.800 --> 38:42.920
he has gone through. Can you ask?

38:49.840 --> 38:52.240
All right, now what you do is ask

38:52.880 --> 38:56.120
this gentleman and that gentleman to put it here into, on this.

38:57.400 --> 38:59.280
into Yes, they have got all.

39:00.040 --> 39:02.520
Y: (...) SM:, on to.

39:03.640 --> 39:05.880
This spot, You can use this and put it here, just put it here.

39:06.240 --> 39:08.440
Not with your finger, Vishuddhi finger, Yes.

39:11.960 --> 39:14.120
Just there, May be it might  have.

39:22.680 --> 39:25.320
Let's see, left Agnya.

39:26.280 --> 39:27.600
Now take a candle for him.

39:29.640 --> 39:31.840
You can take him that side and work it out.You see better.

39:32.960 --> 39:34.440
Can you come this side a little bit please?

39:35.640 --> 39:37.080
Can you get up and sit on this side?

39:38.080 --> 39:39.520
If he could  move a little bit this side then?

39:40.120 --> 39:41.400
He can work out on both of them.

39:42.400 --> 39:44.800
Now , are you better now?

39:46.200 --> 39:49.840
You are better now,You are feeling the cool breeze. Not yet.

39:54.880 --> 39:57.160
It's had the void, still.

39:57.600 --> 39:59.640
you say the mantras of the void and he will be all right. sit down.

40:02.880 --> 40:05.880
I  think yes most of them wanted, little bit.

40:07.240 --> 40:10.600
You see in Sahaja Yoga you are not given any mantra or anything.

40:11.280 --> 40:14.480
There is no, nothing like giving you into a big course.

40:14.960 --> 40:17.120
Like teaching you one after another any mantra or anything.

40:17.560 --> 40:18.840
It's not like this.

40:19.160 --> 40:22.400
What you have to know, where the Kundalini is, how it is moving?

40:23.200 --> 40:25.160
Where it is ? What is the Chakra catching?

40:25.680 --> 40:27.080
and what is the mantra for that?

40:27.440 --> 40:29.520
It doesnâ€™t take anything, hardly takes about a week.

40:29.960 --> 40:31.560
For you to understand the whole thing.

40:32.280 --> 40:34.240
But gradually as you start moving it, you become proficient.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.120
Then you can know, how to do it for yourself and for others.

40:37.840 --> 40:40.960
There is not much of a thing like a child,

40:41.680 --> 40:43.120
When he comes up a little age,

40:44.160 --> 40:45.480
It starts picking up language.

40:46.040 --> 40:47.920
Because he has built in capacity,

40:48.320 --> 40:49.800
to create sound.

40:50.160 --> 40:52.080
And he does it, in the same way,

40:52.680 --> 40:53.440
Once you get it,

40:53.880 --> 40:56.120
when you get the cool breeze in your hand,

40:56.400 --> 40:57.960
you learn it by using it.

40:58.880 --> 41:00.200
You understand it, your self.

41:00.400 --> 41:04.000
You become yourself quite proficient

41:04.400 --> 41:06.360
And you will be amazed, how fast you learn this.

41:06.880 --> 41:09.440
You don't have to learn it just like a

41:10.000 --> 41:10.840
Science book or anything.

41:11.200 --> 41:12.320
Just start learning with

41:12.680 --> 41:13.840
This is the Chakra, it is catching, because now,

41:14.280 --> 41:15.880
for example this Chakra is catching.

41:16.440 --> 41:19.040
Right side, Now there is a mantra for this is of Shri Krishna.

41:20.560 --> 41:21.720
Say this Chakra is catching,

41:22.680 --> 41:25.360
Here, then this the Mantra for Jesses Christ.

41:26.800 --> 41:28.160
Like that you must know,

41:28.400 --> 41:29.840
the Mantra's and the Chakras.

41:30.240 --> 41:31.400
But the Chakras you just know

41:32.080 --> 41:33.920
as a absolutely a knowledge.

41:34.600 --> 41:36.840
Which is built in your nerves.

41:37.520 --> 41:38.560
Just feel it,

41:39.200 --> 41:41.360
This is, now this gentleman is saying it's hot here.

41:42.040 --> 41:43.880
All right, what is that, hot here means what?

41:44.480 --> 41:46.280
That the Sahasrara, at the left side.

41:46.720 --> 41:48.440
First it was the Sahasrara on the right.

41:49.480 --> 41:50.360
Now on the left side,

41:51.200 --> 41:52.920
So that means, there is a Mantra for that,

41:53.400 --> 41:54.400
and that one must be used.

41:54.840 --> 41:56.360
If you use that this will be cleared.

41:57.680 --> 42:00.720
All right, that is how you have to know.

42:01.240 --> 42:02.120
And that's why I said,

42:02.560 --> 42:04.200
it takes time for people, sometimes.

42:04.920 --> 42:06.880
They establish because first you have to know it

42:07.200 --> 42:08.080
and then use it.

42:09.560 --> 42:11.880
Come along, are you come for the first time?

42:12.680 --> 42:14.920
All right, come along, come along this side.

42:18.600 --> 42:20.120
So it is not a difficult thing.

42:22.200 --> 42:23.920
It is not at all a difficult thing to learn it.

42:24.360 --> 42:26.280
It's very easy, you can pick it up in no time.

42:26.640 --> 42:29.080
As soon as you start using your hands on other people.

42:29.720 --> 42:31.000
Please be seated.

42:36.400 --> 42:37.880
Just see them some people come along.

42:38.200 --> 42:39.200
Now these people say,

42:40.320 --> 42:42.040
Who are the latest who have come to Sahaja Yoga.

42:42.560 --> 42:43.560
Let's say, the latest one.

42:47.040 --> 42:49.120
Say those who have come about a month back.

42:51.320 --> 42:54.520
Se he came back, she came back only one month.

42:56.160 --> 43:00.600
And, Y: This is the Sahasrara ...

43:02.920 --> 43:05.640
Monday. all right, he's got, but you see.

43:06.120 --> 43:07.840
Have you been giving vibrations now?

43:10.240 --> 43:14.760
In one month, it starts, so you can imagine.

43:15.560 --> 43:17.040
And you know about the Chakras now.

43:18.320 --> 43:19.560
About the Mantras.

43:20.320 --> 43:23.440
Yes, see that's,  it's very simple.

43:28.080 --> 43:30.400
If you pay attention to it, you can do it much faster.

43:31.880 --> 43:33.560
There are many people who are here.

43:34.040 --> 43:35.280
With in a month one, one's style.

43:35.840 --> 43:37.160
They picked up so many things,

43:38.760 --> 43:41.000
many, within one month's time.

43:42.880 --> 43:47.320
It's all right, because you becomes the knowledge.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.640
You start feeling it one your fingers.

43:50.040 --> 43:50.960
Unless you know, this is the Chakra,

43:51.240 --> 43:52.960
If this finger is, say burning,

43:53.280 --> 43:54.960
that means your left heart is catching.

43:55.880 --> 43:56.880
If your left heart is catching

43:57.400 --> 43:58.640
then you know then you know, because it's burning.

43:59.160 --> 44:00.160
There is nothing to go to the books or anything.

44:00.720 --> 44:02.120
anything to find out, the burning is there.

44:03.320 --> 44:05.560
Isn't it, that is the left heart is catching.

44:06.040 --> 44:06.600
Now only you have to know,

44:07.040 --> 44:08.240
While, when Left heart is catching,

44:08.680 --> 44:10.240
the decoding only, what does that mean?

44:11.840 --> 44:13.840
Your hands will speak, Christ has said. All right.

44:14.560 --> 44:15.960
They will speak, I am just decoding.

44:16.760 --> 44:18.160
Now you see for yourself, if it is true or not.

44:18.680 --> 44:19.800
What does that mean?

44:20.400 --> 44:22.240
Left heart means, there is a problem on the heart.

44:23.440 --> 44:24.960
May be the person is over hard working.

44:26.440 --> 44:27.800
He has forgotten about the spirit.

44:28.960 --> 44:31.720
The Mantra is, you have to say I am the spirit.

44:34.200 --> 44:35.280
It's so simple.

44:37.440 --> 44:38.840
Because you have forgotten about your spirit.

44:39.480 --> 44:41.560
You are on the right side,

44:42.040 --> 44:43.360
in the sense you are more extro..

44:43.800 --> 44:45.880
You are an extrovert.

44:46.240 --> 44:47.560
And more attention is outside.

44:48.040 --> 44:50.440
Not towards is your spirit, left heart is catching.

44:53.600 --> 44:55.480
You start understanding Sahaja Yoga so well.

44:57.320 --> 44:58.720
When your vibrations are sturdy.

45:00.840 --> 45:02.240
Now this finger this is catching.

45:04.080 --> 45:05.280
Now this is catching means

45:05.760 --> 45:07.000
The person has been to somebody

45:07.840 --> 45:09.520
Who is an unauthorized in Spiritual life.

45:10.040 --> 45:11.960
Any thing say, ESP

45:12.600 --> 45:14.280
you call it EST, then you have got

45:14.720 --> 45:16.000
but parapsychology, even psychology.

45:17.280 --> 45:19.000
Then you have other thing like all these guru.

45:19.560 --> 45:21.760
Fall gurus, then can say this aura business.

45:22.600 --> 45:24.680
What else is there, just now he was telling.

45:26.080 --> 45:27.320
Super natural and

45:27.920 --> 45:29.480
under natural and

45:31.080 --> 45:32.160
all these things, you know.

45:32.520 --> 45:34.720
all alternative we can think of.

45:35.080 --> 45:37.360
Anything, you can think of all these things.

45:37.640 --> 45:41.240
And the books and the Lama and the Dhama' and everything.

45:43.480 --> 45:45.160
Even people who go, a sought of

45:45.520 --> 45:47.280
adhere to Church too much.

45:47.680 --> 45:49.480
or adhere to Catholicism.

45:50.080 --> 45:52.240
Because they are not connected with God

45:52.600 --> 45:53.680
and they are unauthorized.

45:54.720 --> 45:55.960
But if you have been to real guru,

45:56.440 --> 45:57.600
then immediately I will know.

45:58.840 --> 46:00.920
You won't have this problem and ascent will be fast.

46:01.280 --> 46:01.920
If you have been to real guru.

46:02.520 --> 46:03.640
But how many are real these days.

46:04.160 --> 46:07.080
In the market only those who are marketing guard there as it is.

46:08.560 --> 46:10.800
In the market only the buyers and the shop keepers.

46:11.840 --> 46:12.920
It's a market place now.

46:14.560 --> 46:16.680
So the real guru's are not to be seen.

46:17.200 --> 46:19.760
There are of course I know, there are many real gurus also.

46:20.800 --> 46:21.560
But where ever they are

46:22.400 --> 46:24.840
They are not in the market, I am the only person fighting them,

46:25.280 --> 46:26.520
And tell them off, you see,

46:27.040 --> 46:29.600
None of them are willing to come down or to conceive to anything

46:30.120 --> 46:31.560
they are saying these human beings are hopeless.

46:32.680 --> 46:34.800
They say twelve year you work Mother then we come down.

46:35.080 --> 46:36.760
They want Me alone to fight the thing.

46:37.720 --> 46:39.480
Poor thing, doesn't matter, so now,

46:39.760 --> 46:41.360
It's a market place, there are buyer.

46:41.840 --> 46:44.280
There simple naive customers.

46:45.600 --> 46:48.600
They just put such absurd things like

46:49.920 --> 46:52.360
somebody says alright, I want to sell

46:54.880 --> 46:56.960
a big palace with this and that

46:57.440 --> 47:01.120
and all that. Only you have to deposit two thousand pounds.

47:01.600 --> 47:03.720
All right, people will be quite willing,

47:04.240 --> 47:06.680
Oh what a bargain? That's big, two thousand

47:07.480 --> 47:08.960
And the palace may belong to the Queen.

47:10.680 --> 47:12.400
If you go there and ask them, Which palace.

47:12.800 --> 47:13.720
Palace wants to say that this is the palace,

47:13.920 --> 47:15.920
and that belongs to the Queen.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.280
This is unauthorized.

47:19.920 --> 47:21.440
Unauthorized people

47:22.280 --> 47:23.560
Who have nothing to do with God.

47:24.560 --> 47:25.960
Who claim that they have something to do with.

47:26.600 --> 47:27.800
With God is falls.

47:28.480 --> 47:30.320
And that's why they catch on this finger.

47:31.360 --> 47:34.400
And what do they do, they use all these techniques.

47:35.760 --> 47:39.040
This techniques are called in Sanskrit language as Avidya.

47:41.960 --> 47:43.480
Avidya means, non knowledge.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.600
You can say that is not knowledge.

47:46.360 --> 47:48.360
something anti knowledge, anti God.

47:49.360 --> 47:50.760
This is anti God, so for that,

47:51.440 --> 47:52.800
the mantra is Shuddha Vidya,

47:53.520 --> 47:55.240
means the pure technique

47:58.240 --> 48:02.120
is the Mantra. Pure technique is the  Mantra. Pure!

48:04.240 --> 48:06.360
means, the one that comes from the spirit.

48:07.960 --> 48:09.520
Now, what they are doing is the pure technique

48:09.920 --> 48:11.560
because it is flowing in that.

48:12.040 --> 48:13.760
If they are moving their hand, there is a power flowing,

48:14.080 --> 48:15.240
through them and they are working it out.

48:16.120 --> 48:19.520
It's not just a acrobatic thing, that's going on.

48:20.560 --> 48:23.440
So  the pure knowledge, for example, the way they are raising

48:23.960 --> 48:25.960
is can......now in My presence.

48:26.520 --> 48:28.800
And they themselves are realized souls, it's working out.

48:30.520 --> 48:32.680
So this all, is the pure Vidya.

48:32.960 --> 48:35.280
is the pure knowledge and pure technique.

48:35.720 --> 48:37.120
And those who have not done this

48:38.360 --> 48:39.720
have gone to such people

48:40.480 --> 48:42.840
Put their head before them, kneel before them

48:44.400 --> 48:46.360
have done something, which should not have been done.

48:47.200 --> 48:50.240
So this is it, and that's how you catch on this.

48:50.880 --> 48:52.480
Thumb, left hand, that's means

48:53.040 --> 48:54.440
a person has been to somebody like this.

48:55.240 --> 48:57.920
But with that if you have any catch on this void

48:58.400 --> 48:59.880
or this void here in the stomach one,

49:00.840 --> 49:03.120
This is left Swadishthana, this placed here down below.

49:04.000 --> 49:05.520
Which moves like that all over here,

49:05.840 --> 49:07.440
and this becomes right Swadisthana this.

49:08.440 --> 49:11.400
Now, supposing a person catches all around here,

49:11.600 --> 49:13.400
this Void and all around here.

49:15.720 --> 49:17.160
is called as the Void, We call it Void.

49:17.640 --> 49:18.560
Its not the Zen Void.

49:19.080 --> 49:20.680
But the Void is the crossing point,

49:21.400 --> 49:23.520
which is the Viscera, the stomach point

49:25.320 --> 49:28.800
where abdomen, you can abdomen

49:29.920 --> 49:33.120
and this part, if it is catching,that means, these are

49:35.040 --> 49:38.520
The ten Principles of the guru.

49:40.120 --> 49:41.440
If this is catching means,

49:41.880 --> 49:45.000
you have hurt, your principle of guru.your guru.

49:46.760 --> 49:47.920
Principle of a master.

49:49.400 --> 49:51.120
That means you have gone to some very wrong man.

49:52.200 --> 49:54.000
If this is catching, that means that now

49:54.600 --> 49:56.120
Just now as they say, his Void is catching.

49:57.040 --> 49:58.280
The Kundalini will be wobbling there.

49:58.640 --> 49:59.560
You can see with your own eyes also.

50:00.360 --> 50:01.600
You can see the Kundalini just,

50:02.040 --> 50:04.600
poor things pulsating there, you can see

50:04.960 --> 50:06.200
the whole stomach going into trauma.

50:08.640 --> 50:10.320
and then you have to say the Mantra

50:10.680 --> 50:13.760
of the Primordial Master, anyone you can do it, you see.

50:14.320 --> 50:15.800
Guru Nanaka's name you can take.

50:16.280 --> 50:17.240
Mohammad's name you can take.

50:17.680 --> 50:19.760
All of them are Prophets, Moses name, Abraham

50:20.440 --> 50:22.440
All these are there, so if you take their name,

50:22.960 --> 50:25.480
The Kundalini can be brought up.

50:25.760 --> 50:27.120
You can strengthen that part.

50:27.640 --> 50:28.760
Then the Kundalini is pushed up.

50:30.960 --> 50:32.400
So all these so called yoga's

50:33.120 --> 50:34.440
also like physical yoga.

50:36.080 --> 50:37.440
Now in the physical yoga, you will catch

50:37.720 --> 50:40.600
catch this finger(right Agaya) and this finger(left heart)

50:43.480 --> 50:45.760
This ring finger and this finger.

50:46.960 --> 50:47.960
This is heart,

50:48.520 --> 50:51.080
means you are paying too much attention to your physical thing.

50:51.760 --> 50:54.640
Anybody who is working is too much physically can catch this.

50:55.560 --> 50:56.640
Plus this (left Swadishthana)

50:56.920 --> 50:59.320
because when you go into action too much also,

51:00.360 --> 51:02.800
as a result of that fume of your actions

51:03.000 --> 51:03.960
create your ego.

51:04.760 --> 51:06.680
This is one of the biggest problem of the West.

51:07.160 --> 51:08.400
You see, they are not aware of that they have ego.

51:09.280 --> 51:11.880
But after realization they start seeing the balloon bloating.

51:12.400 --> 51:14.400
They see and then come and tell Me.

51:15.200 --> 51:16.560
Mother I am catching on my right Agaya,

51:17.480 --> 51:19.120
It's a very delicate stuff,

51:19.960 --> 51:20.560
you can't tell anybody

51:20.840 --> 51:22.520
you have got ego, though you will have it.

51:23.040 --> 51:25.040
So you have to be very careful, when you are talking.

51:26.320 --> 51:29.840
But actually so many people felt there is ego in them.

51:30.440 --> 51:31.800
So they took to,even people

51:32.280 --> 51:33.320
When they feel they have too much ego,

51:33.720 --> 51:34.600
they will take to alcoholism.

51:35.000 --> 51:35.880
Because they are frighten of themselves,

51:36.320 --> 51:37.720
they can't just bear them,they want to escape that.

51:38.480 --> 51:39.960
So people are quite conscious.

51:40.320 --> 51:42.400
But after realization  it becomes a

51:43.000 --> 51:44.440
complete understanding

51:44.800 --> 51:46.480
Because you start feeling a little pain sometime.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.120
in this finger,and you feel a pain here.

51:49.640 --> 51:51.960
and you know that you got this mystery, which is just coming up.

51:52.440 --> 51:54.560
So then you know that how to twist it and take it out.

51:56.440 --> 51:57.440
How to bring it out.

51:57.840 --> 51:59.920
So you start understanding yourself and you start understanding.

52:02.320 --> 52:04.520
I don't have to tell, you know yourself.

52:08.400 --> 52:11.040
Now we have certain things like we use vibrated water.

52:11.880 --> 52:14.520
For clearing your void, now what is vibrated water?

52:14.840 --> 52:17.960
Water is nothing that but divine vibrations are put in.

52:19.040 --> 52:22.400
And they go and start bombarding

52:23.360 --> 52:25.000
that area and try to improve.

52:25.440 --> 52:28.440
We have cured so many people of stomach cancer and all those.

52:29.160 --> 52:31.240
Even we can cure

52:31.880 --> 52:33.880
What you call blood cancer and things in Sahaja Yoga.

52:34.200 --> 52:35.920
So many have been cured, you can cure.

52:36.880 --> 52:39.120
You can do. No problem, you can do.

52:40.160 --> 52:42.120
But what one has to do, to be steadily

52:43.480 --> 52:45.520
mo0ving about in SahajaYoga, not for example.

52:45.960 --> 52:48.960
You have a conception about Christ. Say for example.

52:49.920 --> 52:52.480
Now that conception may not be the real conception of Christ.

52:53.320 --> 52:55.640
May not be or may be so keep your eyes open.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.320
Now what I say in Sahaja Yoga, you can verify.

53:00.160 --> 53:03.000
But do not deny, first verify supposing you go as a

53:03.520 --> 53:05.960
Scientist, you have to go and see for yourself.

53:06.520 --> 53:08.920
Isn't it, you just don't deny at the gate door,

53:09.560 --> 53:12.000
this cannot be done not be true because whatever you know

53:12.560 --> 53:14.440
is your own conception, get inside, all right.

53:15.160 --> 53:18.640
Now when you get inside keep your  eyes open and see for yourself.

53:23.320 --> 53:24.800
And then once you start seeing it.

53:25.480 --> 53:27.280
That's the best way is knowing because

53:27.680 --> 53:29.680
what you see is through your vibratory awareness.

53:30.160 --> 53:32.480
For example now I want to ask you a question.

53:33.200 --> 53:36.320
say, Mother is the their God.

53:39.400 --> 53:40.560
Just ask Me question thrice

53:41.360 --> 53:43.920
and you will find the vibration will increase,it's a fact.

53:45.880 --> 53:48.040
But if you ask about TM, you may start burning.

53:50.240 --> 53:52.080
vibrations will stop, better ask about God,

53:52.600 --> 53:53.840
so that we have vibrations.

53:57.640 --> 53:59.680
Relatively you can understand it first.

54:00.480 --> 54:03.520
like we had people there in Pune

54:04.280 --> 54:05.600
and we had organized a program

54:06.720 --> 54:08.520
and they announced it in the paper

54:09.360 --> 54:11.480
and they suddenly discovered that I am not a Brahmin.

54:12.080 --> 54:13.080
and they got very upset

54:13.680 --> 54:15.600
and they said, you are not a Brahmin, I mean born Brahmin,

54:15.880 --> 54:17.840
I mean, according to them, you can be realized soul born.

54:18.360 --> 54:19.480
How can you be, You can be.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.800
But every Brahmin not a realized soul at all.

54:22.160 --> 54:23.840
on the contrary some are real devils.

54:25.040 --> 54:27.880
and so they wanted to cancel My program.

54:28.360 --> 54:29.800
I didn't know all this, nobody told Me,

54:30.480 --> 54:32.080
But then they said if you would canceled this now,

54:32.560 --> 54:34.400
It's out in the paper, everybody will know that you are,

54:35.040 --> 54:36.400
a sought of of a...

54:38.200 --> 54:39.120
Brahminic society.

54:40.320 --> 54:42.800
Which is very dangerous in India. You are a secular state.

54:43.200 --> 54:44.720
Say, we are also secular state.

54:45.320 --> 54:47.600
Can not proclaim that we are a Brahmanic society and all that.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.760
As we people cannot proclaim that we are racialist

54:51.080 --> 54:51.760
in the same way,

54:54.960 --> 54:57.920
I mean, under law you cannot, but I mean people can be, so

54:58.960 --> 55:00.480
When you see, I was

55:02.400 --> 55:05.480
They were meditating all of them, I gave a lecture there.

55:06.200 --> 55:07.960
then these people, who were sitting there

55:08.360 --> 55:10.200
in front of Me started shaking like this.

55:11.240 --> 55:12.360
So I said, "Now why are you shaking?

55:12.720 --> 55:13.720
They couldn't control themselves

55:14.200 --> 55:15.280
Why are you shaking, so what?

55:15.960 --> 55:17.600
So they said, Mother because you are the Shakti.

55:18.000 --> 55:19.560
You are the power, that's why we are shaking.

55:20.400 --> 55:22.560
I said, " Not that, others are not shaking, why are you shaking?

55:23.440 --> 55:25.840
They said we are very powerful thatâ€™s why we have special energies.

55:28.440 --> 55:29.960
and see these are shaking, this side.

55:30.800 --> 55:32.080
I said, " Just go and ask, from where do they come.

55:32.920 --> 55:34.440
and they all have come from Lunatic Asylum.

55:35.560 --> 55:37.960
Those who are shaking, so I said, now you understand.

55:38.920 --> 55:41.600
Why they are shaking haven, so they said,you mean say

55:41.840 --> 55:45.000
, we are lunatic, I said," You are fanatic if not lunatic"

55:48.280 --> 55:49.840
You see, so, then they started

55:50.360 --> 55:52.160
now they are very great disciple of outâ€™s.

55:52.560 --> 55:54.520
in the sense they are Sahaja Yogis

55:54.920 --> 55:56.960
They  have got all the things  done  for us, they have given up

55:57.440 --> 56:00.080
that Brahmanic ideas, their fanaticism, but

56:01.000 --> 56:03.600
A sought of thing you will see yourself, what I am saying.

56:04.800 --> 56:06.360
Now keep your brains intact,

56:07.080 --> 56:08.880
don;t give away to anything.

56:09.360 --> 56:10.360
Your brains are very important.

56:11.240 --> 56:15.600
They understand thing and you can see things clearly

56:16.120 --> 56:18.360
what's happening, keep your alertness

56:18.680 --> 56:20.320
and see for yourself whats happening

56:21.360 --> 56:24.360
But supposing if you use your brain all the time criticizing

56:24.720 --> 56:27.000
because people who go to various things, say for a person

56:27.360 --> 56:29.080
who goes to this, fat fellow,

56:29.520 --> 56:31.600
who has taken fifty nine Rolls Royces now

56:32.280 --> 56:33.400
They never question him,

56:34.240 --> 56:35.640
They never asked him a question

56:36.320 --> 56:37.760
Why do you need Rolls Royce?

56:39.080 --> 56:41.760
when he sent about fifty lakhs, they starve themselves and sent,

56:42.320 --> 56:43.800
They never questioned him.

56:45.480 --> 56:47.200
But to Me, when they come, they will question ten times.

56:48.680 --> 56:49.960
Why this, because you are free, I am happy,

56:50.440 --> 56:51.520
you are free to question.

56:51.960 --> 56:53.760
But too much questioning is not good, it doesn't help you.

56:55.320 --> 56:57.720
Because I am not here for any Business.

56:59.800 --> 57:02.280
No business is involved, so they asked,

57:02.720 --> 57:04.120
question and questions and questions

57:04.600 --> 57:05.760
about this gentleman

57:06.400 --> 57:09.440
who has taken Rolls Royces after Rolls Royces

57:09.800 --> 57:10.760
Can you imagine.?

57:11.240 --> 57:12.960
English young people, can they afford all this?

57:13.800 --> 57:14.720
In one year they had to give,

57:15.320 --> 57:16.520
one another Rolls Royce to him.

57:17.040 --> 57:19.960
Fifty nine thousand but, when they came from.

57:21.840 --> 57:23.560
Where he said," You must surrender yourself to me,

57:23.920 --> 57:25.680
you must do this, you must do that.

57:26.200 --> 57:26.920
They came here and we said

57:27.440 --> 57:28.960
that you are not to think too much.

57:29.960 --> 57:32.720
Immediately that whole ego, that was suppressed came upon.

57:33.560 --> 57:35.160
They said, "Oh you are doing the same thing to us.

57:36.720 --> 57:38.520
But I said, For what I don't want any Rolls Royce?

57:39.440 --> 57:42.200
Not even a bit of it.

57:43.200 --> 57:44.160
So why should I do it,

57:45.320 --> 57:47.680
The whole ego that was suppressed, you see.

57:48.320 --> 57:49.960
They were all mad after him

57:50.560 --> 57:52.160
One girl went to India.

57:52.800 --> 57:54.800
She use to wash his bathroom.

57:55.680 --> 57:59.640
with her tears, and clean with her hair.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.200
Can you believe?

58:02.560 --> 58:03.920
Just imagine!

58:07.560 --> 58:10.720
Not only one but all kinds of things they use to do with.

58:11.840 --> 58:14.000
and that one was, they were doing service to them.

58:14.480 --> 58:15.960
Their guru, this that, that was all right.

58:16.760 --> 58:18.440
Quite convinced, but when they came to Me

58:18.720 --> 58:20.880
They wasted all their energy in arguing with Me.

58:21.600 --> 58:23.440
And they started thinking,they are great SahajaYogis.

58:23.880 --> 58:25.160
They have to organize everything.

58:25.480 --> 58:27.160
They have to do this, they have to do that.

58:27.600 --> 58:29.040
So very difficult situation.

58:31.120 --> 58:34.400
It happens with so many of them, one girl came to stay with Me

58:34.960 --> 58:37.280
In Oxstead, where I was living, in My own house.

58:37.640 --> 58:39.920
Off she stayed, imagine, no payment, nothing

58:41.440 --> 58:45.360
and so argumentative, she ate My head off, I was fed up.

58:46.400 --> 58:48.480
I told her, I am sorry, I can't give you realization any more,

58:48.920 --> 58:50.920
because you are only interested in pestering Me.

58:52.200 --> 58:54.560
And had no patient, because I had to do something important.

58:55.800 --> 58:57.240
She became so important

58:58.080 --> 58:59.000
I asked her, "By the way tell Me,

58:59.440 --> 59:00.720
how to develop this ego, from where?

59:01.680 --> 59:03.920
She said, "I have no ego, I have surrendered it.

59:04.640 --> 59:07.120
I said,"To whom?" She said, " She said we had a lama."

59:08.120 --> 59:09.680
Lama, from Tibet.

59:10.400 --> 59:11.600
And he sent a words, saying,

59:12.160 --> 59:14.120
that unless and until you have the flooring

59:14.960 --> 59:16.440
Marble flooring, I will not come.

59:18.600 --> 59:20.920
So poor thing, they starve themselves made marvel flooring

59:21.560 --> 59:24.000
for these parasites, they came down here.

59:24.480 --> 59:26.440
They never made any money, they never worked.

59:27.280 --> 59:29.000
You see these Lamas, useless people,

59:29.800 --> 59:34.400
came down there and what was, they were told for one year,

59:35.200 --> 59:37.680
they have to do only one sadhu, one prat ice.

59:38.400 --> 59:39.320
They use to bow before

59:39.880 --> 59:43.200
that horrible Lama, for 1001 times.

59:44.160 --> 59:46.400
And they did it, after that.

59:46.960 --> 59:48.600
Then she came to Me, naturally the whole ego that was

59:49.280 --> 59:50.560
oppress with in just came on Me.

59:52.120 --> 59:54.480
I am sorry, I couldn't give her realization, I must say.

59:56.240 --> 59:59.840
couldn't, and I don't know, she is lost or what has happened.

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:04.120
But this is what it is, that this kind of things can happen there,

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.800
there are problems because of this wrong doings.

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:11.160
They all leave very deep dents within us.

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:13.800
So we must know that we have to get it all right.

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:17.640
We have to be concern about ourselves because we are seekers.

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:19.720
I have come here for yourself.

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:23.480
and the seeking has to be done, perfected

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:26.360
and we have to look after ourselves, we must love ourselves.

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:29.040
and we must have self esteem.

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:30.760
I say this, you should not have diffidence.

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:33.160
Oh God we have done all these things so whats going to happen

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:37.320
So you must have complete confidence, all right, first thing.

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:40.320
And second thing, you must know that these were wrong thing.

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:41.960
We are not going to do any more.

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:44.240
and we are going to be all right

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.560
so compromise yourself with yourself.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:49.320
Don't struggle with yourself, it is important.

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.920
Because if you struggle with yourself, how are we to manage

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:56.760
There will be a big tussle going on within you.

01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:58.560
So better compromise,

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.920
that you are seekers and you must get realization

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.520
There is very easy to make out a person, who is ego oriented.

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:07.960
For us, it may not be for you, but we never say that.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.280
First of all your attention should be one one side.

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:13.160
If it is moving too much, then be careful.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:15.040
Don't move your attention too much.

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:18.920
Doesn't work out, attention has to be on one side.

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:21.720
and try to put your attention one side, that's very important.

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.040
If your all attention is moving here and there,

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:25.400
that's our habit, you see

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:28.160
Somebody comes in, we must see, somebody goes out we must see.

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:29.320
What's the need?

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:31.960
Even the smallest thing happens, people will turn their eyes.

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.840
Try to put your eyes  in proper attention.

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:38.400
We are here, for our realization, for our emancipation.

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:41.160
For the emancipation of all the humanity.

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:43.760
And then you your become enlightened light.

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:47.560
You understand everything, this is your own power,which you use.

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:51.800
And you try to help others, it's as simple as that.

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:59.080
Now that's one point, which I told you, you cannot pay for it.

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:02.960
No you can not, it's something beyond, it's not.

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.440
The first you feel the all pervading power,

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.440
this cool breeze at your feeling is the.

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:11.960
is the all pervading power.Now people have talked about it.

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:15.480
Everybody even in Islamic religion if you see.

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:17.120
It's described as a Rooh.

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:20.040
Every religion has talked of this all pervading power.

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:25.200
Is the Brahama, In the sanskrit language is called as Brahama

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:27.600
Now once you start feeling it,

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:30.560
Then, it's the first time you have felt it,

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.920
but unless and until you use it, you will know

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:38.040
what it is like, for example a flower becomes a fruit.

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:40.120
You take it for granted, who does all this?

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:43.720
All the living work, imagine the tremendous kind,

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:49.400
of the choice that it manifest the way it works out.

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:51.640
See there are tree and trees and trees.

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:55.200
And how a particular tree gives a particular flower.

01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:59.400
How it gives a particular fruit, how grows to particular height.

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:03.800
All this, who organize it, every moment.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:07.160
There are billion and billions of flowers becoming fruits.

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:13.160
I will say, look at ourselves, our eyes how beautiful they are.

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:15.160
What a beautiful camera it is.

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:16.680
all this is done by whom?

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:20.760
There has to be some power who has done this. Isn't it?

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:22.920
We have become human beings, who has done this.

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:26.640
This power, this Brahama and this Brahama power is

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:28.760
now you are feeling for the first time.

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:34.280
But that makes your hands living

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:36.280
The attention comes here,

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:39.800
through your finger now, you will know everything.

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:45.080
Because your central Nervous system your nerves

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:47.280
have been enlighten by the spirit.

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:50.960
That's how the knowledge is your own.

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:55.800
You can verify within you, I asked this Peter Pears,

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.280
Who came as an Epileptic.

01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:59.640
Spoiling on the street in a horrible condition.

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:01.920
He had to sell of his property everything.

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:03.960
His wife was the Dukes grand daughter and all that.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:06.520
You should have seen in what condition he had come.

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:09.200
Actually you won't believe it, if I tell you

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.480
He had not a single pie left on him.

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:14.440
And he had stay with Me to get along in that.

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:18.880
And his wife, he is sitting here, he will tell you that.

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:22.280
The fact that they were left without a single pie.

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:26.360
Health was horrible, they had all kinds of health problems.

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:31.960
And still he never new that he was doing something wrong.

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:34.120
So I asked him, "How is it, you did not discover?

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:36.720
His wife was epileptic.

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:39.200
She use to get into epileptic things.

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:43.160
For three hours, she would be just screaming and shouting.

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.880
She would feel something is pulling her neck

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:47.320
and could not petrified

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:51.600
Three hours, such horrible state that reached.

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:53.320
Daughter was in a big mess.

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:55.880
She had become absolutely a lunatic personality.

01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:59.640
still he never realized, why?

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:02.320
I asked him, "Why? with all your brains isn't it.

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:04.160
The intelligent man, very intelligent man.

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:05.600
She is a M.A, this that,

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:07.400
what's the use of all this intelligence.

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:08.920
If you cannot recognise these.

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:15.760
Till you finish every pie, every drop of your blood,

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:17.800
Why were you continuing with that.

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:20.960
So he told Me that it was like a blanket.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.960
We did not know, which side we were moving.

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:26.480
Every time he was trying some sought of trick on us.

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:29.720
You have to do better thing and you have to this course,

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:32.560
that course and paying money for us.

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:36.680
And that's how we collapsed and we did not know

01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:40.800
till we reach this stage, where we found we have nothing,

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:42.600
The other day somebody from Muktanand came,

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:44.920
he was with him for sixteen years

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:46.680
and he said that, luckily  Mother

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:49.480
I fell in love with an Indian girl in New York,

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:52.960
And she told me that if you are a yogi

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:54.680
You don't look like a yogi at all,

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.720
who is given you initiation and all that.

01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:58.280
If you have a Kundalini jagruti( Awakenning),

01:05:58.600 --> 01:05:59.840
if you are a realized soul.

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:04.040
You should be blooming, you should have radiance on your face.

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:05.120
It should be evident,

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:08.720
people should see that you are a person of that radiance.

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:10.960
There is no radiance, you have such a sallow face.

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:14.360
Thin down absolutely, looks a sick man

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:18.720
And how is it and she is the one, who told me this not possible.

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.240
Now you just pray to God, God take me to right path.

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:24.680
And you just won't believe into all these things,

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:26.680
she didn't know about Me or anything

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:27.840
but she said, this is not the way.

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:29.480
What we know of yogi is like that.

01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:31.920
Now you just don't believe into these crooks.

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:33.600
Those who are taking money from you,

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:36.120
and look at your condition, sixteen years, what did you get.

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:37.800
They have powers like this,

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:39.600
the people who are realized souls.

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:41.960
Know about other people, they have collective consciousness.

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:44.480
You don't have any collective consciousness or anything.

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.240
She was just student a

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:48.560
and she knew about it, these things in India

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.600
They are not naive, they know what it is.

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:52.240
He say, he didn't even,

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:55.760
he was told that I have awakened your Kundalini,

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:57.320
he use to just jump.

01:06:57.920 --> 01:06:59.680
And he use to take drugs, this and that

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:01.880
he could not get over that drug business.

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:05.240
She said, " How can you be a yogi, what are you talking?"

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:08.000
How do you believe such nonsense, She said, "First get well."

01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:11.120
You have no job, nothing, you are starving now.

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:13.920
And he was thrown away from Ashram, when his money was finished.

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:18.400
And you are living in the charities of the government.

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:21.240
I don't want to marry such a man, who is a parasite....

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:25.440
You just go away to India and find out the right answer, then

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:31.280
He came to London, one of our Sahaja Yogi is a travel agent.

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:34.080
He went there and saw My photograph.He said, "Who is this?"

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:37.480
He said, It's Mother, He said, Mother I heard.

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.400
There is one Anand Mayi Maa in India,

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:40.880
where I am going to see her.

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:43.600
He said, "Please don't go and see her

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:46.320
because my father and mother both ruined by her.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.160
and we are absolutely, he was a very big man and

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:50.400
his father was really,

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:53.120
I don't know what happened to intelligent people in India.

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:55.000
Because they are westernized you see,

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:57.240
They don't want to know anything about God or anything,

01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:59.080
The right way, they are so westernized

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:01.040
they want to know through English people.

01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:03.120
So their knowledge is like this,

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:05.040
all the plutocrat are that way

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:07.880
Built up that way, they will read all English books about Gita.

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:11.520
Because they don't know Sanskrit, They donâ€™t want to know directly

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.320
they want to know through some English Author.

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:16.640
Who has written about Gita, because all are English biased, now

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:21.040
so he told that don't go this lady, but Mataji is here.

01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:25.680
But I don't know if you can meet her because she is very busy.

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:27.280
May be, she may not meet up, but one thing,

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:29.440
you can do it,  just dart into her house.

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:32.320
And just tell her that Mother, I am a seeker

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:35.440
and Dinesh has send me and sixteen years I have been with Muktanand

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:37.480
She definitely will have compassion.

01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:43.320
I was about to go out somewhere.

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.440
When suddenly I find him in the reception room,

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:48.200
Just say, somebody stand, he  just said, Mother!

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:50.440
Please save me, I have been to Muktanand for sixteen years.

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.040
Then I said really! I canceled my going out.

01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:55.640
I said just a minute, sit down,

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:57.360
We worked on him, he got his realization,

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.840
And in Australia I hope to meet him sometime.

01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:01.960
He is in a big mess, because you see I told him

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:04.040
We told him, you cannot retain your things.

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:06.480
Because he is booked he had to go away.

01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:09.760
I said, tomorrow if you wait, at least we can work it out.

01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:12.360
But he had to leave,hardly three hours left.

01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:14.800
So I said, Now it's all right we will see it,

01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:16.800
but that's what I am saying, it is like that.

01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:22.680
We must have right understanding about God

01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:28.360
and right understanding about ourselves what should we have.

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:33.160
and the ego should be controlled in a way that in sahaja yoga

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:38.720
There is nothing that you have to give.

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:43.840
Somebody said,"you have to surrender, they got a fright.

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:46.920
I said, What you surrender,what do you have?your ego.

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:49.200
surrender your ego, that's all to God.

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:52.920
Surrender your ego,ego is a stupid thing.

01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:57.640
What do we do, what do we do, let's  see, at the most.

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:00.040
Whatever is dead, convert it into something.

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:02.960
Whatever is available, you make a mic this thing.

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:08.480
This thing, this that but can we make even a particle of dust.

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:10.720
Can we make ourselves, on our own.

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:17.320
We don't do that, we do dead work, can we make?

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:21.600
A fruit out of a flower.

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:25.840
What do we do? Why to have ego but rationally we understand

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:29.480
but it is there you see existing, so we have to work it out.

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:31.960
It's very simple in Sahaja Yoga, when are realized.

01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:35.200
How to put it down, the ego part.

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:37.000
it is very simple.

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:39.880
you have to just turn left side to your right and bring it down.

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.360
You do it thrice it will go down, quite a bit.

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:46.200
but you should be a realized soul, if you are not realized,

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:48.920
It won't work because your vibrations must flow

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:51.000
and the vibrations just take it down

01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:52.880
because they are subtle things.

01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:54.880
They are subtle things, they go inside, they work it out

01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:57.880
with  subtlity subtely take it out that ego.

01:10:58.400 --> 01:10:59.680
because It's a subtle thing within your head ,

01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:01.440
and they are even subtler then ego

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.440
So take it down and push it out, You can do your self.

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.920
So you become the Doctor.

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:11.000
You become the instrument, you become the Pathologist,

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:12.320
you become the medicine.

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:17.960
For yourself and for others, that's what you should happen.

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:21.160
You must have your own powers, if you go to a guru.

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:22.440
You just won't paying him money.

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:24.920
What powers have you got, just judge it on that one.

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:27.200
What have you got? you have fought with your father,

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.400
fought with mother, fought with wife,

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:32.040
everywhere you have created a problem for yourself.

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:34.760
There is no relationship with the whole society

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:38.200
even these stair  people everyone even afraid of a garlic

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:39.080
Do you know that?

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:41.720
You show them a garlic, they will start jumping.

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:43.960
I mean, imagine to be afraid,

01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:46.040
of something of vegetable.

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:49.560
You have to be a powerful personality.

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:53.360
That doesnâ€™t mean you aggress anybody, you do not aggress anybody.

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:56.520
But you are a powerful person in your love.

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:01.320
Love is the most powerful thing and most effective,

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:02.440
but love also doesnâ€™t mean the way

01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:04.400
this fellow talks of this your..

01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:07.760
fourteen year old fellow about love.

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:10.720
Go mad after him,you see singing together,

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:13.560
What's this, he has created such a mess for?

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:17.160
They are all getting mad,

01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:20.000
All will end up into lunatic asylum or in the hospital.

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:23.480
All get either Cancers or

01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:26.240
multiple sclerosis, all sorts of diseases.

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:30.280
When they come to Me at the last stage, when the discover, Oh God

01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:34.280
For somebody got multiple psoriasis and he went to a Doctor

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:36.960
He was surprised, he was surfing this guru for so many years.

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.520
And how did he get and then he comes to Me.

01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:43.160
Then he realizes for

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:46.960
What to do, you see people must go through the whole,

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:48.880
the whole experiences are such extremist that

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:51.640
unless until they are completely ripped off, all there.

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:53.920
things, they don't come to Sahaja Yoga.

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:57.400
But some are, they were  intelligent, they understand.

01:12:58.480 --> 01:12:59.560
and at a point they just give up.

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:02.280
Whatever be the state, doesnâ€™t matter

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:04.960
you are seeker, we have to work out.

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:08.680
Everyone has to work out. All the Sahaja Yogi have to work out.

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:12.640
But that help should not challenge your ego.It's a help.

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:14.720
because you are part and parcel of us.

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:17.960
If this finger is paining if I rub it.

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:20.600
Then I am not trying to help you I am helping Myself.

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:22.720
If I am helping you, I am helping myself.

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:26.040
Because something of Me is paining.

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:28.640
Which I have to help, nobody is there.

01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:31.880
In Sahaja Yoga there is nobody, who is the other.

01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:34.840
You are all one, just now you are not enlightened.

01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:36.760
doesn't matter, we get you enlightened.

01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:40.560
But we are all one, only thing what you have to become is

01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:44.360
enlightened one. Once you are enlightened,

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:46.080
then you become collectively conscious,

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:47.280
then you realized that you are the one

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:50.400
Of the whole, you become, its all again you become

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:53.840
You become a realized soul.

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:57.120
and you become collectively conscious.

01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:00.040
You are become conscious that

01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:02.200
you are part and parcel of the whole.you become.

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:04.760
Don't have to form a UN or some sorts of things.

01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:08.120
Just become, your awareness becomes.

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:13.480
That should be so easy, so logically you understand Sahaja Yoga.

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:17.400
Because your brain, after coming from all these experience

01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:20.360
just starts judging Sahaja Yoga. So can understand it logic.

01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:22.480
After that you must know that

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:26.480
When the Kundalini passes over Agaya Chakra,

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:27.840
you become thoughtless.

01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:31.760
Means there is a space in between the thoughts, one thought rises

01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:35.680
another arises passes down, there is a space in between.

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:39.720
those two thoughts and that is place, where you have to reach.

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:43.280
Once you are there, you are thoughtlessly aware.

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:47.600
This is called as Nirvichar Samadhi, where you go and become

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:50.680
thoughtlessly aware, Nirvichar Samadhi.

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:53.560
And then when the Kundalini pears es through here.

01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:57.960
Absolutely pears es and comes out very well.

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:01.160
You can give realization moving your hands just liken this,

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:02.760
it flows from your hands.

01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:06.840
It's true, It looks like testing, but you can give realization.

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:10.160
Once the Kundalini has pears you can.

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:13.320
but there are temptations, people have

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:16.960
become egoistical,they think they are great all that, is not true.

01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:21.440
You have just become conscious of being part and parcel.

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:27.200
If you understand that, that you have now become

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:31.720
entitle to use this power of compassion of God

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:35.440
power of his love, through you, you can maneuver it.

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:38.480
know how to handle it, you are the instrument which understands

01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:42.160
and that's how, you become the spirit now,

01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:44.240
because the spirit is the connection.

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:47.800
It's so wonderful afterward your health

01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:49.920
I mean your doctor's pills goes to zero.

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:54.360
You never get bored, you are always employed

01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:58.160
You have no time, for anything, you are a very busy person.

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:01.960
My little grand child was hardly five years,

01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:05.480
once we went to the airport, very busy, like this, like this.

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:08.720
so My daughter asked," What are you doing?"

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:12.680
Why are you so busy, so don't talk just now.

01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:15.560
She said, "What are you doing." She is a born realized child.

01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:18.680
Very much knowledgeable, she knows a lot about Sahaja Yoga,

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:22.400
from her childhood from her birth.

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:26.960
Now done. What? I was tying the whole of

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:31.720
Whole of airport, is very messy place.

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:36.440
So they are busy people you see, you become busy too

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:39.040
because you know it, you know the problem, you are there.

01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:44.040
They start doing it. How are you? Better.

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:51.800
Put him left to the right.

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:55.160
Sound! you have sound in the ear.

01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:10.640
You got some oil here, Olive oil or something

01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:15.120
or some ghee, have you got?

01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:18.480
You can get some oil, I will vibrate.

01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:24.200
Now next time you all should bring your oil and your salt and sugar

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.440
I will vibrate for you. We have to look up.

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:29.880
See our body everything we have to respect ourselves.

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:33.200
This is the temple of God and the temple has to be looked after.

01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:35.760
Get her this to, because you have jumped.

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:38.520
into all kinds of things you know all thorns and things.

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:41.480
It's like that so better get it prepared completely

01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:46.080
It's better, now are you all right? Still there.

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:55.760
Let come, I will just work it, come here.

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:10.120
You just say, that forgive me if I have done anything wrong.

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:11.640
Just say it in your heart.

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:20.480
Olive oil. But you see how can you give it to everyone.

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:23.280
They should bring of their own.You can give it to this gentleman.

01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:27.840
Now you must pay for this olive oil.

01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:29.440
Whatever it is to the gentleman.

01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:31.560
You shouldn't take anybody else's thing, all right.

01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:33.840
That's not done in Sahaja Yoga, we must pay for our oil

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:35.760
and sugar and all that. We shouldn't

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:47.600
SM: He has. Y: (...)

01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:50.640
SM: The school good,  very good.

01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:53.360
Now you have got some vibrated olive oil.

I hope you have with little bigger

01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:07.200

What is the mean of this?

SM" What? Y: What is the meaning of this?

01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:07.600
You see this, this is a sign of innocence, this swastic, Ganesha.

we are drawing that on you.Yogi,"Is this Ganesha?

01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:12.520
Mother: Ganesha is a symbol of innocence.

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:15.320
He is embodiment of innocence, Ganesh.

01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:18.360

In our custom Ganesha is always worshiped,

01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:27.840
because He has innocence.

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:30.360
This is an action of Shri Ganesha.

01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:33.040
This is a Nirmal Vidya, Shudha Vidya.

01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:35.480

gradually you will understand that what I am.

01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:09.760
immediately you won't go very deep into it,

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:11.800
otherwise you will not be comfortable but this is the thing.

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:14.880

They all are busy in export and import, they have forgotten God.

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:32.120
Mother I am still a student. Mother, Yes,, student it's good.

01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:35.760

May God bless you. Good he got it.

01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:53.920
Are you getting it on your head.

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:02.800
You have to have faith in Me, On top of your head, it is our place.

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:06.280
All right, Yogi, "it is becoming cool.Mother, "It got cool here."

01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:59.720
Now if you have come in front of Me, it doesn't mean

01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:01.960
that I am nothing and it also doesn't mean that

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:03.920
you are nothing, first of all you should know that

01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:05.960
you must be something thatâ€™s why you have come here.

01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:07.760
and I am also something that's why you are getting realization.

01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:09.800

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:37.080
So we have to be careful, all right.

01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:43.400

01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:58.320
We have to look after our body very much

01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:00.520
but in such a way that it is

01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:05.320

See we we have liver problems, most of us have liver problem.

01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:19.800
And that's why the sugar is vibrated.

01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:31.080
If you can open there thing I can give it to every one.

01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:34.640

But if they Yer says, you have liver,

01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:47.000
then you should take little extra sugar

01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:49.160
But you mix it up with other sugar.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.320
SM: Go on mixing that. Y: I see.

01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:52.960

right hand sided and the

01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:06.760
seven for the left hand side.

01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:09.320
You have to put them under your pillow or

01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:12.040
I mean the pillow side.

01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:14.680
under ground with this plastic bag

01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:18.120
opened up in the night and closed in the day time.

01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:21.680

Lemons are very good you see.

01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:33.800
and morning time you close it.

01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:36.720
and then the whole thing should be thrown.

01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:39.120
After using it for seven nights.

01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:42.160
into the river.

01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:44.920
or somewhere it goes out, that's all.

01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:49.360
This will take away all the negativity you have.

01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:52.880

01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:36.200
Its good for you to gargle

01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:38.160
because of Vishuddhi, you see,

01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:41.720
Vishuddhi is very bad, you have to gargle yourself,

01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:44.800
Now I would request somebody can, can anyone?

01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:47.680

Never twist the pillow, make the pillow nice one.

01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:47.520
not too high, not too low, just in the center.

01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:51.200

01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:27.800
All right, very good. Should we try something on

01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:31.920
come here, just come, I will use a little for him.

01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:33.280
all right for him if you don't mind.

01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:38.160
This I vibrated just, come here in front.

01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:41.280
Come little a head still closer.

01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:45.320
Oh My God, It's so hot.

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:47.640
Oh My God, so much heat is coming out.

01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:50.440
All the heat. Yogi: This is what my mother says.

01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:55.640
Now it is getting cooler.

01:37:57.840 --> 01:37:59.800
Such heat ! Oh

01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:09.600
Indians understand things so better

01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:11.920
You don't have to tell them.

01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:15.480
They know what it is, they know the importance of feet.

01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:17.720
You see it's very simple to tell them

01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:25.800
with other people, one has to be carefully, interducing the subject.

01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:28.800
This with Indians, go head long, they know everything.

01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:38.520
Are you all right now?

01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:42.480
It's too hot, it all happened due to this.

01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:45.440
Whatever you have done, It will pass off

01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:50.840
Take a photo from us and put one hand towards the photo.

01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:54.640
and the other hand outside, it will go out, it is much better.

01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:58.840
Are you feeling better, is it cooling, is it good?

01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:04.680
Void is also caught badly.

01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:17.200
Put your hand under the feet.

01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:33.680
All right.

01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:40.040
That his Kundalini wobbling absolutely down below.

01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:55.480
That all right.

01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:31.960
Humm better

01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:49.360
Now see, feeling better, put your hand on your head.

01:40:58.320 --> 01:40:59.200
Humm is it all right?

01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:03.200
Not yet come? Y: No.

01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:09.600
Mother: It will come. Yogi: What is blocking, What is bl;blocking?

01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:13.040
Y : What is stopping. SM :In this you know.

01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:17.320
you have gone to different places.These people mesmerize you.

01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:20.000
Put your hand behind, this side.

01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:45.880
Now ask a question, Mother, Are you Mataji Nirmala Devi?

01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:58.440
SM: Is it there. Yogi: Yes a little bit.

01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:04.440
Left hand towards the photograph and the other hand outside.

01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:07.360
Left hand towards the photograph and right hand outside,

01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:09.400
You have catch in your left side.

01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:16.440
Emotion, emotional thing, but it comes from horrible things

01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:19.000
you have been to, see they give you emotional problem.

01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:23.160
Left side, it is all impure knowledge.

01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:26.160
Better.

01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:35.080
Humm better.

01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:42.760
Are you unhappy with me?

01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:44.640
Haa ha, I am unhappy.

01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:47.400
I am not unhappy, but they are  stupid.

01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:49.280
Let everybody go there, thing may improve(sarcastically She says).

01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:58.000
Now it has come, it is all right.

01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:03.120
Improving, keep coming here, are you living near by?

01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:06.440
Now go, look after him, Y: OK. May God bless you.

01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:14.960
Y: Sted will export brown sugar

01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:21.800
But it is all right for him, he has a right Nabhi.

01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:24.440
He is left, left, I am sorry

01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:27.280
He has a left liver, what you call that

01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:31.320
is a cold liver, so put, it's all right.

01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:35.040
left to the right, right to the left, in this case.

01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:38.400
Right, do have allergies or something, you catch cold

01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:42.200
Y: I got a frozen shoulder.

01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:45.560
All right, can you take out your coat, I will fix that.

01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:53.400
Another thing is, no guru works anything.

01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:55.840
They just sit down on this seventh floor.

01:43:56.520 --> 01:43:58.880
Just that, move that side.

01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:02.240
and put your, just sit down here.

01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:05.160
Move that side, face that side and sit down.

01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:08.880
Just place that side, all other side.

01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:12.440
put this on the mother earth.

01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:52.400
All right, Better, are you feeling the relief.Y: Yes I am.

01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:54.760
You are feeling it, all right.

01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:04.600
Now you take My photograph, all right,

01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:07.120
put a candle in front of it, put your left hand

01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:09.480
towards the photograph and right hand on the mother earth.

01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:11.320
She will suck your problems.

01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:16.720
Arthritis can be cured, yes

01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:20.040
Lift your hand still frozen.

01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:23.520
up to what point, doesn't take

01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:29.640
put it on the ground.

01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:41.560
How is he? All right ?

01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:44.680
Feeling the cool breeze, how about this lady?

01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:49.480
What about the lady there?

01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:51.800
Y: Doesn't want it Mother. SM: she is all right.

01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:54.000
Doesn't want it. SM, I could see that.

01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:58.400
You have too much ego My child in you? Why did you come here?

01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:02.800
If you didn't want it, why did you come here?

01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:07.120
Y: She understand. S M: Understand what?

01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:12.720
Can you understand God? What is there to understand?

01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:16.600
You see your intelligence is limited.

01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:20.040
your rationality is limited, your mind is limited.

01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:22.680
We are talking about unlimited.

01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:26.640
It is like trying to understand

01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:31.280
Histology without getting seeing through the microscope.

01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:36.080
Can't understand anything, you don't want your self realization.

01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:38.480
Why?  you don't want it

01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:44.960
What is it

01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:49.480
What, more about what?

01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:52.400
But you should getting of first of all,

01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:54.640
otherwise how will you know.

01:46:56.200 --> 01:46:57.560
They just said Me, Isn't it absurd.

01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:00.400
Isn't it now

01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:02.160
Isn't it absurd, don't you think so?

01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:04.480
Unless and until you will get it how will you know

01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:06.920
Because I can't tell you why are moving hands like this.

01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:09.200
you don't  can't feel anything, what can we do,

01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:11.200
you must get your realization, better get it.

01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:14.240
All right, there is no question of understanding it.

01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:16.520
That rationality how far can you go?

01:47:18.680 --> 01:47:20.320
SM :Yes. Y: She says she can feel it."

01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:22.720
you are feeling what cool breeze?

01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:24.920
Yes, what she says.

01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:30.160
She said, she is asking whether it's, whether it's

01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:33.480
inside already, why does she need to get it.

01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:36.720
What makes you think, it is inside.

01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:42.440
Is everybody has it but it is not manifesting, isn't it?

01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:46.600
Is it there you feel so?

01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:51.040
Do you feel you have got, you are all ready a realized soul?

01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:53.920
You think so, you think so?

01:47:56.760 --> 01:47:59.240
SM :What she says. This is thought particular when you born Mother.

01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:02.480
She is asking,  doesn't God put it there when you are born.

01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:04.320
Yes it is always there within you.

01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:07.560
All right as a human being you have it. but it's not manifesting.

01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:10.520
It has to manifest.

01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:15.760
SM: How did? Y: How can you give it to her Mother? SM: No I can't

01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:18.720
It's your own, it's not, you see like one light.

01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:20.280
which is enlighten

01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:22.280
Enlightens another light.

01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:23.880
It nothing giving.

01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:26.520
You understand that.

01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:31.320
Then you can't, because can  a light, which is not enlightened

01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:33.560
can be enlightened and what's the harm if I give you.

01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:35.360
I am not hitting you hard.

01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:37.480
I am doing anything wrong thing, what's wrong.

01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:39.800
If I want to give you a present, won't you have it?

01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:41.440
You will definitely have.

01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:46.520
Where you have fought?

01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:51.560
Y : What exactly you are doing Mother?

01:48:52.240 --> 01:48:54.080
Because that's the trouble, you are wearing us

01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:56.560
we are wearing for all of us. Not only for,

01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:59.680
But you are wearing us all, means we are,

01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:03.720
we never likes  such people here, those who are egoistical.

01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:06.600
See if you have to get it, you better get

01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:08.440
otherwise don't come here.

01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:18.080
She must be told that she has to get it first time Mother.

01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:21.400
Not first time but at least try, you can't say no.

01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:22.880
It's not, this is the place

01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:25.200
where we give self realization to people.

01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:28.320
Not because you style our vibrations by this way.

01:49:29.240 --> 01:49:30.560
It is not for argument or anything,

01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:32.600
if you don't at least  leave us alone.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.120
Everybody has to get it otherwise you go away.

01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:37.760
Why to waste our energy, every bodies energy

01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:40.240
You don't want to do it, you don't want to trouble us.

01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:42.920
You are, I am telling you that.

01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:46.360
It is for us to decide this, is it? Yes of course.

01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:50.000
These are our premises, we know which people are troubling us.

01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:52.560
Yes I invited you not to trouble Me,

01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:55.560
Because we asked you to put, what we want to do.

01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:56.920
You should do otherwise you should go away.

01:49:57.440 --> 01:49:59.520
Why are you here, I mean, supposing you go to a place

01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:03.160
You can not do what you like, you have to do

01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:06.520
You you if you don't understand

01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:08.080
After what I have talked,

01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:10.080
you can never understand, we are sorry.

01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:11.800
You can never understand,

01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:13.200
you are not the one, who wants to understand

01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:15.760
You are not the type to understand,

01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:17.440
what is so harming in putting your hands.

01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:19.240
You are not going to be killed, are you going to be killed,

01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:21.240
What's going to be happen?

01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:23.600
I mean you enter any pub you want to,

01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:25.640
You want to talk to any man, you want to

01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:27.840
What is the harm in putting your hands like this?

01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:29.840
What's the thing, that's going to happen?

01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:36.040
Beg a pardon.You didn't want. Y: Say there is  any harm in it.

01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:40.040
Then why didn't you do, why are telling no to people.

01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:45.600
All right, first time you may not have it, but we have to try.

01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:48.280
You see if you just don't do it now, when will you do it.

01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:53.040
We are not going to waste our time, all right, this is it.

01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:55.840
You are not so important to us

01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:57.760
that you must get your realization.

01:50:58.160 --> 01:50:59.960
But one thing if you are not taking your realization

01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:02.440
and you are just putting your force here

01:51:02.920 --> 01:51:05.880
You are spoiling, the energies of others, no doubts

01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:09.160
You will understand if get your realization.

01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:11.400
Otherwise you won't, that's the trouble with you.

01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:14.920
You don't want to get your realization how will you understand

01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:18.080
You see you cannot do like this, wherever you go,

01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:22.000
you have to according to the place you are going

01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:25.720
supposing you go to the Church and you take out your hat

01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:28.040
if you are man, if you are lady, you have to wear your hats.

01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:30.960
You see that also you will do there but not here,

01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:33.600
Here you want to take your liberties for everything, how can you?

01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:36.400
What say?

01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:41.120
What do you want to understand, what do you want to understand.

01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:43.400
And so far you have been saying I am on twenty seven, what?

01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:52.200
You see that is true but it is not abandonment, it's not madness.

01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:56.240
It's too different from Church all together but it doesn't mean.

01:51:56.880 --> 01:51:59.240
It doesn't mean that you can just come here and sit and watch

01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:02.360
everyone like inspector general, it's not so.

01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:04.400
Then why why did you come?

01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:07.080
You see, you have come for this purpose for self realization,

01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:08.160
All right

01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:13.680
Who who, who, just a minute, who told you that?

01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:17.080
What, which one he what a sister?

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.280
I was very val...

01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:24.000
What did you tell her that you here and watch?

01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:30.400
He said, He told too much, Mother, That's why she got ruined.

01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:33.680
That's what I say that with rationality see if you tell them

01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:36.440
they get off, don't tell them too much.

01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:39.600
They come, they think they are inspector general come here

01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:41.520
To see everyone.

01:52:41.880 --> 01:52:43.720
Too much you told, you should not.

01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:45.880
I told you many a times not to talk too much.

01:52:46.840 --> 01:52:48.840
Because ego is such it sits on your head

01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:52.000
They suddenly becomes inspector General, see

01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:55.480
That's the trouble with them.Now better, are you.

01:52:56.840 --> 01:52:59.240
It's much better now. Good, see

01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:02.520
Now see this, listen here, you are going, listen here.

01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:06.280
She this gentleman's hand is now better, did you see that.

01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:10.520
Now do you want to understand that, how it has happened.

01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:27.280
You see, in this country

01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:30.160
In this country the ego is so much.

01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:33.520
That you don't know, how to and what extent it can go.

01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:37.360
We had in our house the guest, who was the chairman

01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:41.000
of the High Court judges of  Hail.

01:53:41.640 --> 01:53:44.040
Now believe it, what a man he must be.

01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:47.000
And we had a garbage cleaner, who came to our house.

01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:51.000
I asked in that, this little more you have to take.

01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:53.520
So I will give you some extra money, please take it today.

01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:57.640
So he said, "you don't understand the laws of this country

01:53:58.200 --> 01:54:00.000
You don't understand this, I need more money,

01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:03.480
this  that he was shouting, so he came out, this gentleman

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:05.200
He said, "why are you shouting, what is the matter?"

01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:07.400
You Indians, you don't understand any law at all

01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:09.480
He is the man who is international laws

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.120
You see, he is the chairman of all the thing,

01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:13.920
he was looking at him.

01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:16.360
And I just reel into laughter, see I couldn't see this.

01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:20.160
Garbage cleaner talking to him, so much ego.

01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:22.240
Ego, this is ego, you know this is stupidity,

01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:24.600
the edocity just see, so clear.

01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:27.960
The way she was talking to Me, at least she must be a

01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:30.760
Maha Yogi to talk like that.

01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:32.720
Any one of it? Isn't it.

01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:35.400
But here in this country you see, nobody is shameful of it.

01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:37.320
There is no humility.

01:54:38.680 --> 01:54:41.680
Even the President of India will stand, when I go to see him.

01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:44.760
You will be amazed, he would not sit till I sit down.

01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:49.360
They have this innate humility, look at this boy,

01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:51.360
he came and just said, I must touch your feet.

01:54:54.040 --> 01:54:56.160
See this is the course of all western civilization.

01:54:56.880 --> 01:54:58.880
Then only the people,who mesmerize them, we bowed to them.

01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:03.240
Those who be fool us we bow to them. Isn't it.

01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:06.840
We should understand, " this is a course of our country, be careful.

01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:10.680
Be careful, look at her the way she was talking.

01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:14.080
She was not interested anything.

01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:16.120
she came just to see and understand

01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:18.160
Who is she to understand, I don't understand this.

01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:20.080
What does she think about herself.

01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:26.320
Where is her brother? US, PHD.

01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:28.520
Poor thing I am sorry.Where is he gone?

01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:40.120
I you are invited, you can not do what you laugh.

01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:49.440
Much better,now Lets see, hold My hand tight and that put down

01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:59.120
Better, keep your right hand upwards.

01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:02.400
Like this, you have weakness in your left side.

01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:07.840
Better, left is weak.

01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:14.000
Mother: flowing  do you feel the energy flowing.Y: Much better.

01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:22.960
This is nothing, we had drunkard, you see, who are with Me.

01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:29.000
Much more then this.

01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:31.840
Very Road  chaap( very cheap), get the top his voice.

01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:35.000
But first I didn't know that he was a drunkard as person.

01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:37.640
They told Me, Mother he is a drunkard.

01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:39.520
I said," All right, let him talk."

01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:41.280
It's a good certificate for Me.

01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:44.800
What's that, now it's all right,

01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:46.840
And how much time they waste of others, you see.

01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:50.800
As if she doesn't want to do, you can ask her to go.

01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:54.280
Please go away, why are you sitting here.

01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:56.520
Very humbly you should say, better go away, sorry, you go away.

01:56:56.960 --> 01:56:59.800
She has just waste every bodies energy, what  she thinks of herself.

01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:13.880
Y : She was a saint.SM: I don't know.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.960
Its nothing but simple ego, you cannot explain it.

01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:19.680
See that's very stupid thing

01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:21.920
.It's ego and that's leads you to edocity

01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:24.560
That's why the sensitivity is so low.

01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:26.560
You see can not  make out.

01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:31.920
See even from the face they cannot make out.

01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:36.160
anything it's insensitive, they don't understand beauty, nothing.

01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:39.120
Nothing they understand, if you are insensitive, it happens.

01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:41.840
How are you now? Now!

01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:44.080
Better Yes! Haa ha ha

01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:48.520
May God bless you. Take it now.

01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:53.200
So happy to see you here, very happy, you are so much better.

01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:56.320
May God bless bless you. Look after your self.

01:57:56.720 --> 01:57:58.520
Why? But you have a liver, still.

01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:01.200
Yogini :Yes. SM: Liver you have still.

01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:03.960
Now, what should we do? Did you get some sugar.

01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:06.560
Is that's the sugar there? .....

01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:09.160
Sugar is yes, sugar is more important now then anything.

01:58:09.680 --> 01:58:13.040
Liver is out, you have to work it out.

01:58:13.480 --> 01:58:15.320
All right, liver is very....

01:58:15.560 --> 01:58:17.760
Yogini : What do I do with it?

01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:19.000
Less thinking.

01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:23.720
That's my problem, that's my problem.

01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:27.160
Come here I will fix it. Now there is only one way.

01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:30.880
is to believe in Christ, all right, now lets see, close your eyes.

01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:34.240
Just believe in Him, He did exists.

01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:37.200
Yogini: I believe, He exist yes. SM : that.

01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:38.440
Yogini :You clear them now.SM: All right.

01:58:38.840 --> 01:58:40.800
Mother," All right now still there is  an effect here.

01:58:43.760 --> 01:58:46.840
I am still have a lot of guilt and negativity.

01:58:47.480 --> 01:58:50.040
Unnecessarily why do you have a guilt.

01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:51.640
SM: Don't have any guilt.Yogini: I do.

01:58:52.160 --> 01:58:53.680
Yogini,"I do have I don't know why?"

01:58:54.080 --> 01:58:57.640
That's goes with the whole catch, conditioning.

01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:00.120
Now better.

01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:13.240
Is  your hand trembling? Y: Yes. SM: Give a jerk to it.

01:59:14.120 --> 01:59:16.360
This will start showing, shake also your hands will shake.

01:59:17.080 --> 01:59:20.280
Which ever is the weakness, you see it's come out.

01:59:20.840 --> 01:59:22.800
Take out your watch for a while.

01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:30.480
Better now, but still there.

01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:36.960
Sit comfortable, please comfortable, take time sometime.

01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:50.200
Yogini :I think now I had liver problem. SM: you have.

01:59:56.200 --> 02:00:01.760
SM : Eyes are steadied, you have a kataar or something.

02:00:06.720 --> 02:00:09.400
SM: Did you bring any oil? Yogini: Yes the little bottle."

02:00:09.880 --> 02:00:12.800
Mother, " Put it in the nose and the ears."

02:00:13.680 --> 02:00:16.240
Yogini:In the nose. SM: with a dropper.Yogini: Yes.

02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:18.680
SM: 'Once in a week.

02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:23.200
Mother, "Yes yes you can."

02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:32.240
Hamsa is very bad, did you give her camphor?

02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:35.120
SM: This lady. Yogi: Yes Mother, shall I give her more.

02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:38.320
Did you put some camphor here?Yogini: No.

02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:41.400
Better do it, she takes from him that camphor.

02:00:42.600 --> 02:00:45.920
will be good, put little bit in the nose, that oil.

02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:48.760
With little in the ears, camphor is good for ears.

02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:52.360
Like it camphor, you like the smell.Yes, Mother just like it.

02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:54.320
SM: May God bless you. Yogini: Thank you very much.

02:00:57.480 --> 02:00:59.400
And avoid fatty foods.

02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:02.520
Anything like fried food and ..Yogini: I don't eat.

02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:06.920
That's all right, sugar, you must take to sugar, all right.

02:01:07.320 --> 02:01:11.440
Three four tea spoon to a cup. Yogini, "really lot of sugar."

02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:14.800
Really! whats about dal making?

02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:16.960
With my sister, my sister came to you.

02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:20.600
Diabetes is too much sugar brings down diabetes. Let her feel

02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:23.720
Better come to Me, I must see you.

02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:27.440
Diabetes is curable,.... Yogini : Not yet.

02:01:28.120 --> 02:01:30.280
No no, she has to work it out

02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:32.240
No no, she has to, diabetes is absolutely

02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:36.360
curable  in Sahaja Yoga absolutely, they will tell.

02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:39.600
Give Me time, we have Doctors, which can tell.

02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:47.720
Give her salt, give her the salt that I gave you.

02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:51.440
The salt, let her come and see these.

02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:55.080
Give these people. How are you?

02:01:55.680 --> 02:01:56.800

You have decided not to marry.

02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:44.160
Mother I will marry sometime.

02:03:44.680 --> 02:03:47.000
Good, you have a left Nabhi, that's the problem.

02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:50.520
Yogi," Left Nabhi, what is that?" Mother they will tell you.

02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:54.360
All right just ask them.

02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:09.000
How are you now better.

02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:13.880
You gargle yourself, add more salt, use it for gargle.

02:04:14.640 --> 02:04:18.320
This yogi's Vishuddhi, this Chakra is not all right.

02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:20.360
You add it to other salt make it

02:04:21.800 --> 02:04:25.040
That's sugar,all right. Yogi: that can I add to salt?

02:04:26.480 --> 02:04:27.280
Sugar cane it is.

02:04:41.560 --> 02:04:43.680
Very small neck, you want to say, I don't know,

02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:46.200
they have such a small neck, I don't know.

02:04:58.440 --> 02:05:00.360
It's a complete medicine shop.

02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:03.600
All right just to be turn.

02:05:06.560 --> 02:05:07.680
Can you pass it?

02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:17.760
Hoping the brother must be upset.

02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:22.360
How are you? Are you all right, is like this at home also you.

02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:24.080
Very much egoistical.

02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:26.840
What has she done?

02:05:28.800 --> 02:05:30.160
What has she studied

02:05:37.360 --> 02:05:40.600
Catering , catering means what like hostess

02:05:41.080 --> 02:05:43.880
Film madam, making film.

02:05:44.440 --> 02:05:47.120
She makes food, God save the...

02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:50.840
She is a cook?

02:05:52.760 --> 02:05:54.680
Serves? Y: Serves the food.

02:05:56.680 --> 02:05:57.920
If she serves like this.

02:06:00.440 --> 02:06:01.800
You can imagine.

02:06:04.680 --> 02:06:06.200
You should not have told her about this.

02:06:06.800 --> 02:06:08.240
You must see the person, how he is.

02:06:10.040 --> 02:06:11.080
Very much egoistical.

02:06:13.720 --> 02:06:14.840
Very ego oriented.

02:06:17.640 --> 02:06:19.600
And they don't feel it, you see in this country,

02:06:20.040 --> 02:06:21.960
you can carry on with this but in India you cannot.

02:06:22.480 --> 02:06:24.240
If you are like this they will all through you out.

02:06:24.680 --> 02:06:27.440
In the society you can't exist, is a person with a such strong

02:06:27.960 --> 02:06:29.680
tongue and all that. You have to be humble.Isn't it?

02:06:30.200 --> 02:06:32.360
You can't tolerate a man who talks like this

02:06:33.080 --> 02:06:35.520
or a woman, who talks like this, the humble person.

02:06:38.160 --> 02:06:39.600
Did I vibrate this. Y: Yes yes.

02:06:42.280 --> 02:06:43.320
May God bless you.

02:06:48.800 --> 02:06:50.920
Now you all look after one person each.You see.

02:06:51.560 --> 02:06:53.920
Sought of you just see that which person, I will look after

02:06:54.360 --> 02:06:55.920
That person I will look after, till they are established.

02:06:56.520 --> 02:06:59.560
And if they are not established then it's your responsibility

02:07:01.480 --> 02:07:02.600
He has good ...

02:07:11.560 --> 02:07:14.200
Liver is, liver is showing, your liver is all right.

02:07:14.760 --> 02:07:16.040
But liver is showing.

02:07:16.720 --> 02:07:18.480
Thank God, left is all right.

02:07:20.320 --> 02:07:23.360
But liver is showing, that's this, Y: For my eyes.

02:07:23.680 --> 02:07:26.760
What about your eyes? Is it low....

02:07:29.920 --> 02:07:31.360
Also use a candle.

02:07:34.200 --> 02:07:36.000
Ask somebody to give you a bandhan on your back.

02:07:36.560 --> 02:07:38.560
Someone on the back Agaya for your eyes

02:07:39.200 --> 02:07:42.040
And left Agaya in front, it's a good idea, try that.

02:07:48.240 --> 02:07:51.080
ix the salt with more. SM: Yes you can.

02:07:56.320 --> 02:07:58.360
For you,  Is it for him?

02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:01.280
Y: get for me. SM: For you it's all right, sugar is all right.

02:08:16.280 --> 02:08:17.560
You never brought any sugar.

02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:21.760
Is there any sugar for him, give him some vibrated sugar.

02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:23.960
When he goes for America,  all right.

02:08:27.720 --> 02:08:29.600
This is a good one, this is a good idea.

02:08:30.840 --> 02:08:32.840
Yes, I mean I can put My fingers in.

02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:51.040
Is there somebody, who has to do.

02:08:55.040 --> 02:08:58.080
For him, you can tell him the photograph.

02:08:58.680 --> 02:09:00.240
You work out with the photograph?

02:09:00.680 --> 02:09:02.280
All of you should on the photograph yourself.

02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:04.240
Seven days you are going to carry.

02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:07.480
because  for left it will be better off.

02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:09.720
You can give the photographs, all of you.

02:09:10.280 --> 02:09:11.760
and tell them how to use it.It should work out.

02:09:12.440 --> 02:09:14.360
For seven days let them work out with the photograph.

02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:20.000
You also take the photograph.

02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:39.680
Rosy Kroshan is another....

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:46.240
All very avidya

02:09:49.680 --> 02:09:51.440
They talk on a mental level.

02:09:57.640 --> 02:10:00.520
They teach on a mental level.

02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:02.800
Y: Up bring themselves on a spiritual level.

02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:04.320
They don't think of that.

02:10:05.720 --> 02:10:07.400
They don't think, it's a money making proposition again.

02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:09.120
It's in a way.

02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:14.680
It is it is, it will end up like that.

02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:16.720
Y: this is it, it's right thing.

02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:18.440
SM: That's true but you should see yourself.

02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:21.760
You see that  if you somebody talks on a mental level

02:10:22.520 --> 02:10:24.600
gives no experience of respect.

02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:27.440
you have to be collectively conscious, Christ has said,one thing,

02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:30.760
Your hands must speak, just go and ask them, they talk of Christ.

02:10:31.560 --> 02:10:34.080
Are your hands speaking, Are their hands speaking.

02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:36.800
Christ has said, is it? And he said,

02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:38.200
that I will send you a comforter,

02:10:38.680 --> 02:10:40.240
who will make you know your father better.

02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:43.520
Not this knowledge, what is the use of knowing everything

02:10:44.040 --> 02:10:45.840
about everything but not about your own father.

02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:50.120
Not so sure shot to argue with,

02:10:50.680 --> 02:10:52.400
And then what about your own powers.

02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:54.840
Do they give you any powers? Do you feel anything.

02:10:55.360 --> 02:10:57.440
Can you understand anything, can you do anything?

02:10:57.960 --> 02:10:59.120
Can you give realization to any one.Y: I do understand.

02:11:02.560 --> 02:11:04.200
No no what do they develop?

02:11:04.760 --> 02:11:06.840
You see what I am saying, they don't develop anything.

02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:10.120
not a single person, who can say, I can give self realization.

02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:13.560
Isn't it, in the rusilation, not a single person.

02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:17.440
It's not a single guru, who says I will give you realization.

02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:19.800
Not a single guru, that one thing is sure.

02:11:20.640 --> 02:11:23.720
They talk of it but they never say we will give you realization.

02:11:26.680 --> 02:11:27.560
Beg a pardon.

02:11:31.240 --> 02:11:34.480
He says the guru, the guru will guide you.

02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:36.560
That you can find it yourself.

02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:38.680
You see, the question is  if

02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:41.160
we have to find it ourselves we don't need a guru.Why ?

02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:49.440
They are all using your naiveness, you see.

02:11:50.600 --> 02:11:51.680
Because, you don't know

02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:53.840
if you were an Indian you would have known

02:11:54.360 --> 02:11:55.880
that you have to have an enlighten soul.

02:11:56.960 --> 02:11:58.560
Who is a guru, to give you realization.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:01.880
But you, these people can also say that

02:12:02.520 --> 02:12:04.200
Oh see we are, we don't believe in guru,

02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:05.600
some say we believe in guru.

02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:08.080
Means you believe in the enlighten one.

02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:10.040
Who are not not in the point, what is an

02:12:10.680 --> 02:12:12.520
The interest of an enlighten one is to see that

02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:14.280
to get your realization.

02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:18.200
The guidance they give you is what? Nothing just talking about it.

02:12:18.720 --> 02:12:20.800
And talking about, it has been done since ages.

02:12:21.480 --> 02:12:23.920
Now your fore fathers and your fathers

02:12:24.520 --> 02:12:25.320
Fore father's and their fore fathers and fathers

02:12:25.880 --> 02:12:27.960
have talked and talked and talked.

02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:30.280
As time for your hand to talk.

02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:34.280
All right, this is what, your hands must

02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:36.840
Now see you come

02:12:37.320 --> 02:12:39.680
To ring, they feel it, so we say yet it's not done.

02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:42.880
We don't say you have got it, we don't say that.

02:12:43.480 --> 02:12:45.880
We say it's not done. It's not done, it's not done.

02:12:46.760 --> 02:12:48.160
When it is done ,it will be done.

02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:50.160
You see we cannot see that.

02:12:50.760 --> 02:12:52.840
Because you have come here, you will have it.

02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:55.280
Isn't it, we can't just say, of course we will work it out.

02:12:56.040 --> 02:12:57.840
We will work it out, you will work it out, lets see.

02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:00.800
When it will work out, will work out, all right.

02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:04.560
It is like this, it is not that just you become a member something.

02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:07.480
or you go to a lecture you become Roosy Croosy

02:13:08.720 --> 02:13:09.760
How can you become?

02:13:13.880 --> 02:13:16.280
That's, that's what I am telling you.

02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:18.400
You must  know that you have not become anything.

02:13:18.880 --> 02:13:20.680
You have been just listening to their acrobats.

02:13:22.800 --> 02:13:25.000
intellectual acrobat, this is not there.

02:13:25.640 --> 02:13:28.040
Y: Vibration to everything.SM:  What you have to have

02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:33.120
is to get yourself the power."

02:13:33.640 --> 02:13:36.280
Your own power, your spirit must manifest.

02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:39.840
Are you manifesting? Not!  SM: Then finished.

02:13:41.240 --> 02:13:43.160
That should be their criteria, all right

02:13:43.760 --> 02:13:44.800
They may say I am true, I am true

02:13:45.240 --> 02:13:46.800
but who gives you the coffee is the one

02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:49.080
If they will say, I will give you coffee

02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:50.960
He just give you an empty cup.

02:13:51.480 --> 02:13:54.840
Then won't you, won't you think that oh God!

02:13:55.400 --> 02:13:56.960
This is an empty cup not a coffee.

02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:00.160
So the proof of the pudding is in the eating of it, as they say

02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:03.600
What powers did you get?

02:14:04.160 --> 02:14:06.160
You must express your powers.

02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:09.160
You must, while all these people are saying, we are manifesting.

02:14:11.880 --> 02:14:13.880
None of them would say because they are not.

02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:16.800
One gentleman came and told Me, Mother

02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:20.760
I am self realised person and I am a twice born.

02:14:21.320 --> 02:14:23.400
I said, " All right, just tell Me, where is your Kundalini?"

02:14:24.120 --> 02:14:26.760
He said, I don't know, where is the Kundalini of this person.

02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:30.160
Where is your blockage, where is the blockage of this person?

02:14:30.680 --> 02:14:33.200
That I don't know, Then you are suppose to be useful for what?

02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:36.200
See if I say there is light in this room,

02:14:36.560 --> 02:14:38.120
you should be able to see

02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:46.360
Y: Either all this is illusion, SM: all illusion.

02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:50.240
They are all illusions, all they, they are very illusive

02:14:50.800 --> 02:14:53.040
They live in the illusion, I don't know why?

02:14:53.600 --> 02:14:56.040
And the end of this ....is disastrous

02:14:57.960 --> 02:15:00.040
I don't mind if they carry on with the illusion only,

02:15:00.600 --> 02:15:02.920
it is disastrous, see now you have been there

02:15:03.400 --> 02:15:05.760
that's why your avoid caught up.

02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:07.960
I mean you would have been realized in no time

02:15:08.520 --> 02:15:09.400
because you are a seeker but

02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:11.680
because the void is caught you are taking time, isn't it?

02:15:12.240 --> 02:15:13.600
So in a way they have harmed you

02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:18.080
even if you won't get involved you will get harmed.

02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:21.560
This is it, that's why I am very up set them.

02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:23.600
They want to make money, they can

02:15:24.160 --> 02:15:25.640
They deceive,you see, they can be burglars.

02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:27.680
That's easier way to make money.

02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:30.600
Not very difficult, why to make all this fuss.

02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:37.920
All right, you keep it here, Now. Y: Somebody wants this.

02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:41.480
SM; Sugar.Y: There is extra sugar, somebody ?

02:15:49.960 --> 02:15:53.240
Y: Anybody else with. SM: What's your name?

02:15:54.120 --> 02:15:55.160
Y: Anything to vibrate.

02:15:56.840 --> 02:15:59.960
Better now, think before, that you have to decide about marriage.

02:16:00.240 --> 02:16:01.960
Marry now, thirty two, when will you marry?

02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:06.480
You have to have some great people being  born.

02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:09.720
on this earth, some great saint have to be born.

02:16:10.280 --> 02:16:11.960
Hum, all right.

02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:17.480
Yes, good news, Armu's wife is going to have a baby.

02:16:25.520 --> 02:16:26.760
How happy they feel you know.

02:16:27.760 --> 02:16:31.160
He is a swiss gentleman......

02:16:49.720 --> 02:16:52.640
I think she came to see here if you are brown...

02:16:53.240 --> 02:16:54.280
Y: it's clear not.

02:16:56.720 --> 02:16:57.520
How she came here your sister,

02:16:58.040 --> 02:17:01.240
you see like a great patroange angel.

02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:14.640
I don't know if that is so, how can she enjoy.

02:17:15.240 --> 02:17:16.280
If she has not touched My spirit.

02:17:17.320 --> 02:17:18.960
See she should be anxious to touch the spirit.

02:17:19.560 --> 02:17:21.000
But I think she is not a seeker at all.

02:17:21.560 --> 02:17:25.600
Y: She is. SM: She is, you think so.

02:17:26.640 --> 02:17:27.760
Try to bring her now.

02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:32.960
Put her left to the right.

02:17:37.200 --> 02:17:38.560
I wish you luck.

02:17:41.640 --> 02:17:43.600
She should, I mean she should really come and enjoy but

02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:45.480
But there is no, she was in a very arrogant mood,

02:17:46.040 --> 02:17:47.720
she came here and I can see her.

02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:54.800
So it's over, can I make a move.

02:17:57.680 --> 02:18:00.400
Still little more  more.

02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:04.760
What you do you get vibrated for everyone in a big way.

02:18:05.320 --> 02:18:07.280
and give it to them if they need it.You see, I will be moving now.

02:18:07.880 --> 02:18:08.720
Out of London.

02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:18.160
How are you now.

02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:22.760
Looking very much better.

02:18:23.800 --> 02:18:26.520
Very much better, that anemic look has gone now.

02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:28.680
You don't look anemic any more.

02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:32.920
You have left Nabhi.You have  left Nabhi problem.

02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:37.400
Also left Nabhi ....

02:18:40.520 --> 02:18:41.680
It's all.

02:18:52.680 --> 02:18:54.320
I don't feel guilty at all, do you?

02:19:01.400 --> 02:19:04.880
For what? if you had  done anything that great.

02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:07.680
Leave off, you could never have got realization.

02:19:08.440 --> 02:19:09.320
So why to feel guilty?

02:19:11.320 --> 02:19:12.480
Just come here, come!

02:19:49.800 --> 02:19:50.560
Better now?

02:19:54.800 --> 02:19:56.120
Yes, better?

02:20:01.520 --> 02:20:04.520

02:20:10.120 --> 02:20:12.600
How are you? All right.

02:20:15.360 --> 02:20:16.760
These are the best lemons.

02:20:17.400 --> 02:20:18.920
You see, they suck your vibrations very fast.

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
These are little high breed the other one are.

02:20:22.360 --> 02:20:24.920
These are normal, these are normal, I think.

02:20:25.360 --> 02:20:26.880
They are very good.

02:20:33.320 --> 02:20:36.160
I am sorry I have leave early because it's already quite late.

02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:38.360
They must be waiting

02:20:44.480 --> 02:20:46.240

You can take our three four boxes

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:00.960
with  us in the plane.

02:21:04.080 --> 02:21:05.360

02:23:45.920 --> 02:23:46.600

Keep for the Ashram.

02:24:09.080 --> 02:24:10.200

Y: Two or three, whatever you suggest.

02:24:47.320 --> 02:24:48.960
SM: Three is better, so who is the third one.

02:24:49.520 --> 02:24:50.800

02:24:51.400 --> 02:24:53.640
Nick and Wok, myself and with Tresha.

02:25:01.880 --> 02:25:04.880
Can have matka.

02:25:05.560 --> 02:25:06.320
All right.

02:25:17.560 --> 02:25:19.200
It's from both the Ashrams, we have got this.

02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:23.800
Now for our traveling as you know.

02:25:26.640 --> 02:25:29.600
You have got all the papers, how much, how much do we have.

02:25:30.600 --> 02:25:32.920
Y: I don't know how much was in before but.

02:25:33.520 --> 02:25:35.800
There was four hundred nineteen ideen... cash now,

02:25:36.360 --> 02:25:39.200
There is Cheque of five  hundred and eight.

02:25:47.040 --> 02:25:48.440
He told Me there is thousand five hundred.

02:25:49.040 --> 02:25:51.600
Y: Yes Mother all together, all together.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:53.320
Y: There is about four hundred.

02:25:57.600 --> 02:25:58.960
It is Kumkum will be vibrated.

02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:03.560
Just but they do it, you see, Indians are very plastic minded.

02:26:05.280 --> 02:26:07.560
Horrible, It's beyond Me.

02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:29.640
I wouldn't brought a pen or anything.

02:26:33.120 --> 02:26:35.560
All five minutes in the room, what had happened, How are you?

02:26:38.200 --> 02:26:39.400
SM: Better now.Y: Yes Mam.

02:26:44.720 --> 02:26:46.160
Put it in a proper thing you know.

02:26:54.560 --> 02:26:55.840
From plastic to plastic.

02:27:06.480 --> 02:27:09.600
But dust can disappear into dust but plastic cannot.

02:27:19.160 --> 02:27:22.040
I don't understand why should they put Kumkum in a plastic thing.

02:27:22.520 --> 02:27:24.120
It is just can't understand, stupid people

02:27:25.360 --> 02:27:27.920
Hum hum, very good peas.

02:27:28.520 --> 02:27:30.440
Who's done, you bought this

02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:34.880
Yogini, It was here in the Ashram, I don't know who got that.

02:27:36.280 --> 02:27:38.760
Is it, done beautifully.

02:27:40.640 --> 02:27:42.760
Nice thing they do, it's very nice.

02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:46.480
Its for pouring water or what?

02:27:49.440 --> 02:27:50.280
Y: Ya. SM: Is it?

02:27:55.200 --> 02:27:56.120
It was in the Ashram

02:28:01.960 --> 02:28:03.400
How are you, good, I am very happy.

02:28:04.440 --> 02:28:06.240
She is doing well, she is doing very well.

02:28:07.040 --> 02:28:10.400
Yogini: Mother I want one suggestion from you.

02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:16.720
I  have been actually, this was guru, who gave the mantra.

02:28:17.360 --> 02:28:19.960
So I want to just to say that, how what should I

02:28:20.440 --> 02:28:22.880
I don't actually chant the mantra now.

02:28:23.480 --> 02:28:25.640
Since I have SM: You don't.

02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:28.680
Now but... Mother: What is his name?

02:28:29.320 --> 02:28:33.200
Hari, Hari, Shri Hari Maharaj.

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:35.560
Where does he live? Yogini: Jalandher.

02:28:39.560 --> 02:28:41.720
Does he take any money? Yogini: No, nothing.

02:28:42.440 --> 02:28:44.720
Yogini: No, it is not an institute, I mean it's just a...

02:28:45.320 --> 02:28:46.320
He lives in someone's house

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:50.040
and everybody goes there and do meditation.

02:28:52.560 --> 02:28:54.600
It is coming but don't understand how come he gave you mantra.

02:28:55.280 --> 02:28:58.280
He shouldn't give you  mantra.Yogini: This is what he...

02:28:59.160 --> 02:29:02.520
Satnam, satnam, He only chants this day and night.

02:29:03.160 --> 02:29:04.960
He looks realized.

02:29:05.680 --> 02:29:08.600
SM: He seems to be realized. Yogini: Is he a great one?

02:29:09.520 --> 02:29:11.680
SM: He doesn't seem to be a great one but he is a realized soul.

02:29:12.480 --> 02:29:14.960
Yogini: OK, then me and my husband

02:29:15.640 --> 02:29:17.840
chant their mantra.

02:29:19.040 --> 02:29:21.480
Mantra is not right thing.OK, show him My photo.

02:29:21.960 --> 02:29:24.360
He will understand, he is realized.

02:29:27.680 --> 02:29:29.600
Just realized guru.

02:29:30.160 --> 02:29:32.280
At last, at long last.

02:29:34.240 --> 02:29:35.840
But he has no institution, takes no money.

02:29:36.400 --> 02:29:37.960
Fine, you see he doesn't take any money institutionally

02:29:38.440 --> 02:29:39.280
He lives in somebody's house.

02:29:39.840 --> 02:29:40.920
Very simple man, that's what she is saying

02:29:41.440 --> 02:29:43.320
but mantra he cannot should  not give,

02:29:43.840 --> 02:29:45.320
Though whatever mantra he has given you

02:29:45.840 --> 02:29:47.760
is awaken mantra, no doubt because he is realized soul.

02:29:48.440 --> 02:29:50.840
He should not, because you stuck up with that.

02:29:51.520 --> 02:29:52.760
You see these realized soul also don't

02:29:53.440 --> 02:29:54.400
that you people are not even realized.

02:29:55.840 --> 02:29:56.960
Then they give you mantra.That's the problem.

02:30:00.640 --> 02:30:03.480
So I haven't since stop saying mantra. SM: You just

02:30:04.200 --> 02:30:05.880
SM: You don't need, now you become the guru,

02:30:08.920 --> 02:30:10.400
Isn't it, now you become the guru."

02:30:11.480 --> 02:30:12.320
You will know the mantras now.

02:30:12.840 --> 02:30:14.320
now you will know what mantra's to be done, for whom?

02:30:14.920 --> 02:30:16.960
Why should you take any mantra from anyone anymore?

02:30:18.040 --> 02:30:19.560
SM: To a unrealized soul you should, never give a manta

02:30:20.280 --> 02:30:22.080
to begin with and one mantra is not going to work it out.

02:30:22.600 --> 02:30:24.520
And now a days the Kundalini doesn't move.

02:30:26.440 --> 02:30:27.600
Satnam is only for Vishuddhi.

02:30:29.400 --> 02:30:32.040
What about, other Chakras.Yogini: It means Satnam can be recited

02:30:32.960 --> 02:30:35.080
. SM: Yes, You can say Twemev Sakshaat Satnam...

02:30:35.680 --> 02:30:38.240
if you say it is all right, that's a truthful name.

02:30:38.880 --> 02:30:41.360
You can say but that will open your Vishuddhi.

02:30:43.640 --> 02:30:45.440
Hum.. better vibrations.

02:30:49.840 --> 02:30:52.360
That's Satnam means true names

02:30:53.840 --> 02:30:55.840
SM: Yes. Y: Every where Satnam.

02:31:17.120 --> 02:31:19.040
Somebody will pick Me up on saturday.

02:31:23.040 --> 02:31:25.200
I mean, somebody has to just come, we have a car.

02:31:26.360 --> 02:31:28.160
But only problem is that somebody has to come.

02:31:35.040 --> 02:31:37.720
Buy flower, saturday is it open, the flower shop.

02:31:39.640 --> 02:31:40.800
The big play.

02:31:45.880 --> 02:31:50.080
You can go and buy, then pay you.
