03:59.590 --> 04:18.480
The Mayor of Cincinnati has declared today
as Shri Mataji Day in Cincinnati. 

04:18.480 --> 04:23.040
I will read this proclamation 
which I’m very thrilled about 

04:23.040 --> 04:28.640
because some of you will know that 
Shri Mataji is an international figure. 

04:28.640 --> 04:34.960
She is a diplomat.
Her husband has been the Secretary General 

04:34.960 --> 04:42.960
of a very large United Nations organization.
He has been knighted by the Queen of England. 

04:42.960 --> 04:49.920
He has received the highest 
awards from many, many nations. 

04:49.920 --> 04:54.240
And he is one of the living 
legends in the world today. 

04:54.240 --> 04:59.280
His name is Sir C. P. Srivastava.
And Shri Mataji herself has  

04:59.280 --> 05:06.880
been honoured all over the world.
And it is my pleasure to read this proclamation. 

05:06.880 --> 05:14.480
It says, “We proclaim, whereas Shri 
Mataji Nirmala Devi, the Mother, 

05:14.480 --> 05:18.720
is recognized internationally
as the most significant  

05:18.720 --> 05:25.520
spiritual force in the world today.
And she will awaken in us the force  

05:25.520 --> 05:29.920
that will change our lives
and change the world. 

05:29.920 --> 05:36.640
And whereas, The United Nations 
honour her with a UN Peace Medal 

05:36.640 --> 05:43.280
and whereas, Shri Mataji has developed 
a simple meditation technique, 

05:43.280 --> 05:50.720
Sahaja Yoga, which enables the en-masse 
experience of Self-realization, 

05:50.720 --> 05:57.680
the breakthrough of a new awareness.
And whereas Sahaja Yoga is the  

05:57.680 --> 06:03.120
next evolutionary step for humanity,
which can bring the transformation of  

06:03.120 --> 06:10.480
human consciousness to a higher level.
And whereas the city of Cincinnati  

06:10.480 --> 06:15.040
is honoured by the visit
of Sri Mataji Nirmala Devi, who  

06:15.040 --> 06:20.480
will introduce through Sahaja Yoga,
the experience of harmonious  

06:20.480 --> 06:26.320
well-being and inner transformation
that can lead us out of the confusion  

06:26.320 --> 06:31.600
and frustration of modern living
and spark the greatest inner  

06:31.600 --> 06:36.000
transformation yet seen.
Now therefore, I,  

06:36.000 --> 06:45.840
Dwight Tillery, Mayor of the city of Cincinnati,
do hereby proclaim Thursday, September 10, 1992, 

06:45.840 --> 07:17.840
as Sri Mataji Nirmala Devi Day in Cincinnati.”
Shri Mataji:  

07:17.840 --> 07:22.240
I bow to all the seekers of truth. 

07:31.360 --> 07:39.600
At the very outset, we have to 
know that truth is what it is. 

07:39.600 --> 07:46.880
We cannot change it.
We cannot conceptualize it. 

07:46.880 --> 07:54.880
Unfortunately, at this human 
level, we cannot feel it. 

07:54.880 --> 08:09.360
We have to become something more.
Unless and until that happens to us, 

08:09.360 --> 08:20.400
we cannot know the truth, the absolute truth.
I call you all as seekers of truth. 

08:20.400 --> 08:28.080
And if you are seekers of truth,
you have to open your mind like scientist, 

08:28.080 --> 08:32.480
and treat whatever I am 
telling you as a hypothesis, 

08:32.480 --> 08:41.600
and if it works, you should accept and grow in it.
You have been already told, I think, 

08:41.600 --> 08:49.040
about the subtle system 
that is built in within us. 

08:49.040 --> 08:56.800
This system has been built in 
during our evolutionary process. 

08:56.800 --> 09:04.080
Whatever is the truth has to be tangible.
It should not be accepted blindfolded  

09:04.080 --> 09:09.440
because I am telling you.
You have to verify yourself  

09:09.440 --> 09:17.360
that whatever I am telling you is the truth,
because you will have the actualization of  

09:17.360 --> 09:25.440
the experience of the truth.
That is, firstly, that you are  

09:25.440 --> 09:33.120
not this body, this mind,
this ego, conditionings,  

09:33.120 --> 09:41.360
but you are the pure Spirit.
This is the first truth about yourself. 

09:41.360 --> 09:50.640
And the second one is that there is 
an All-pervading Power of divine love 

09:50.640 --> 09:55.360
which they call by different names.
You may call it ‘Ruh’. 

09:55.360 --> 09:58.720
You may call it ‘God’s Divine Love’,
you may call it the  

10:01.760 --> 10:08.960
cool breeze of the Holy Spirit,
you may call it Param Chaitanya,  

10:08.960 --> 10:13.520
call it by any name.
But there is such a  

10:13.520 --> 10:23.520
subtle force, energy, which exists,
which does all the living work. 

10:23.520 --> 10:29.360
Here now we see flowers.
Flowers, so beautiful,  

10:30.640 --> 10:36.160
and we take them for granted.
We don’t question how this  

10:36.160 --> 10:44.880
miracle has taken place.
Look at your eyes. 

10:44.880 --> 10:52.000
We don’t question how this 
camera has come to exist. 

10:52.000 --> 10:59.040
Look at your brain, what a computer it is!
We never question it, how it has come to us, 

10:59.040 --> 11:07.840
how we have become human beings,
and how all these things are  

11:07.840 --> 11:17.360
working within us automatically.
If you ask, “Who runs our heart?” 

11:17.360 --> 11:21.120
The doctors would say, “It’s 
an autonomous nervous system”. 

11:21.120 --> 11:28.000
But if you go further and ask, “Who is this auto?
Who is running this heart?” 

11:29.760 --> 11:34.720
There are so many questions which 
cannot be answered by science, 

11:34.720 --> 11:40.240
and science is not all conclusive.
Recently I was reading a book,  

11:40.240 --> 11:47.440
The Limits of Science,
and he has asked three questions in that book: 

11:47.440 --> 11:53.360
“How do I come to be a human 
being?” is the first question. 

11:53.360 --> 12:04.160
Second is, “What is the purpose of my life?”
and “Why should I live any longer?” 

12:04.160 --> 12:09.040
All these three questions 
can be very easily answered 

12:09.040 --> 12:20.160
once you become the Spirit.
This transformation is  

12:20.160 --> 12:25.360
also called by many names.
People call it Self-realization. 

12:25.360 --> 12:30.880
Some call it Self-hood.
Some say it’s Self-knowledge. 

12:30.880 --> 12:42.960
But what is this Self they are talking about,
and what will happen if you get the Self-hood? 

12:42.960 --> 12:51.520
I have to tell you that all of you 
have got your Divinity within yourself, 

12:52.800 --> 13:02.560
and surprisingly it is absolutely intact.
Whatever you might have done, whatever  

13:02.560 --> 13:07.760
mistakes you might have committed,
your Divinity is absolutely intact,  

13:07.760 --> 13:12.480
it is not at all disturbed,
cannot be perished; cannot be perished, 

13:12.480 --> 13:26.880
cannot be destroyed by anything.
The reason is, this Divinity is eternal, 

13:26.880 --> 13:33.280
and whatever is eternal cannot be harmed.
Nobody can destroy it,  

13:33.280 --> 13:38.960
and that is within you there.
And sometimes the glimpse of that may be, 

13:38.960 --> 13:44.720
that you think whatever you see, 
there must be something beyond. 

13:44.720 --> 13:49.600
And when you start thinking that, 
then you become a seeker of truth. 

13:52.960 --> 13:57.360
Surprising in these modern 
times, there are so many, 

13:57.360 --> 14:10.720
so many seekers of truth, and so many are lost.
When we start seeking truth, we definitely  

14:10.720 --> 14:17.440
have to put faith into something.
When we put our faith into religion also, 

14:17.440 --> 14:24.720
what do we find that religion is 
power-oriented or money-oriented, 

14:24.720 --> 14:34.080
so there is fundamentalism.
Whatever attitude people might have taken, 

14:34.080 --> 14:38.480
those who started this 
religion are immaculate people, 

14:38.480 --> 14:42.400
they are divine people,
and they were like the flowers  

14:42.400 --> 14:47.680
on one tree of spirituality.
Only we have plucked these  

14:47.680 --> 14:55.280
flowers and we are fighting.
How can we fight in the name of God? 

14:55.280 --> 14:58.080
One should reason it out, 
and once you reason it out, 

14:58.080 --> 15:01.360
you start thinking there 
must be something more to it. 

15:02.320 --> 15:07.520
So when this residual force,  

15:07.520 --> 15:13.840
we call it as Kundalini in India
– ‘Kundal’ means coils – starts rising, 

15:13.840 --> 15:22.160
it passes through six centres and 
pierces through the seventh one, 

15:22.160 --> 15:27.920
which we call as Brahmarandhra, 
or the fontanel bone area, 

15:27.920 --> 15:37.280
which was a soft bone in your 
childhood, and this opens. 

15:37.280 --> 15:43.360
It is the actualization of your baptism.
It is not just I put my hand on your head and say, 

15:43.360 --> 15:48.560
“Now you are baptized”.
This kind of self-certificate  

15:48.560 --> 15:54.240
is not going to help us.
Now if you become, say,  

15:54.240 --> 15:58.240
the governor of this place,
then you have certain powers. 

15:58.240 --> 16:02.800
Now if you become the Self, or if 
you become the Self-realized soul, 

16:02.800 --> 16:10.640
then you must have some powers.
And people normally certify  

16:10.640 --> 16:16.720
themselves as this, as that.
This is not the way you can achieve that state. 

16:16.720 --> 16:22.240
You have to be honest.
Because if you are honest seekers, 

16:22.240 --> 16:28.240
then we should expect the actualization 
of the experience first thing, 

16:28.240 --> 16:34.400
about which Thomas has written in his treatise.
I wish you could read the Gospel of Thomas, 

16:34.400 --> 16:39.200
in which he has clearly said that 
the experience of Self-realization 

16:39.200 --> 16:44.080
is the most important thing 
and that is to be achieved. 

16:44.080 --> 16:49.600
You must be knowing Thomas ran away,
because I think Paul was trying to  

16:49.600 --> 16:54.240
dominate him or whatever it was.
And ultimately he went to India. 

16:54.240 --> 16:59.200
But before going there he went to Egypt 
and he put all his treatise in a jar. 

16:59.200 --> 17:05.440
For fifty years, they have been 
trying to put it in common language 

17:05.440 --> 17:14.560
and now the book is out, partly.
So, this experience has to  

17:14.560 --> 17:24.640
be there that you feel your Spirit
and feel this All-pervading Power all around us. 

17:24.640 --> 17:31.280
So far you have not felt it.
So, we have to be humble about it. 

17:31.280 --> 17:38.400
As Christ has said, “Meek in heart 
we inherit the earth”. That’s a fact. 

17:41.200 --> 17:46.960
You have to be meek about it that 
so far we have not found the truth 

17:46.960 --> 17:51.760
and that this Divinity is within us, 

17:51.760 --> 17:57.440
which is going to connect us 
to that All-pervading Power, 

17:57.440 --> 18:08.800
by which we are going to know the truth.
Apart from many other benefits that  

18:08.800 --> 18:20.080
you get by the awakening of this force
within you, one, your physical conditions improve. 

18:20.080 --> 18:26.160
Once you come to Sahaja Yoga, you are 
amazed how your diseases are improved. 

18:26.160 --> 18:30.880
Here in Cincinnati, one lady who 
was suffering from cancer got cured. 

18:31.680 --> 18:38.240
But curing people is a funny job.
Once you cure them they just disappear. 

18:38.240 --> 18:42.560
They are very happy, they write to you, 
“Thank you very much, you have cured us”. 

18:42.560 --> 18:46.800
But they are not the ones 
who give light to others. 

18:46.800 --> 18:54.000
Secondly, mentally people improve very much.
All their habits which are destructive, 

18:54.000 --> 18:59.920
which we have acquired, in 
any way, they disappear. 

18:59.920 --> 19:09.600
And disappear so fast, that I have 
known people in England that overnight, 

19:09.600 --> 19:16.400
they gave up drugs, overnight.
Today they are beautiful people,  

19:16.400 --> 19:20.240
professionals, working very well.
This I am telling you,  

19:20.240 --> 19:34.240
in the year 1970 was happening in England.
Or say 74, especially in a big group it happened. 

19:34.240 --> 19:44.000
Then the second advantage is that, 
that you find your own Spirit. 

19:44.000 --> 19:54.080
Your Spirit shines in your attention.
Thus your attention becomes active. 

19:54.080 --> 19:59.520
Like the light- now there is a light here.
When it falls on something,  

19:59.520 --> 20:05.280
you can see it clearly.
But it doesn’t act on that, maybe little bit  

20:05.280 --> 20:10.880
it might sort of spoil it.
But it doesn’t act. 

20:10.880 --> 20:21.760
But when your attention is enlightened,
then wherever you put your attention it acts. 

20:21.760 --> 20:28.880
That means on your hands also, 
you find this cool breeze blowing, 

20:28.880 --> 20:32.800
and the fingertips which are 
the sympathetic nervous endings, 

20:32.800 --> 20:38.880
become enlightened.
So five, six and seven, these centres on the left 

20:38.880 --> 20:42.720
and the seven centres on 
the right get enlightened. 

20:42.720 --> 20:48.880
And you immediately know what’s wrong with you,
and also you can find out  

20:48.880 --> 20:55.600
what’s wrong with others.
So what has happened to your attention is that, 

20:55.600 --> 21:03.360
you have got a new awareness, where 
you become collectively conscious. 

21:03.360 --> 21:08.800
Who is the other, when the 
microcosm becomes the macrocosm? 

21:08.800 --> 21:13.120
When a drop becomes the 
ocean, it becomes the ocean. 

21:13.120 --> 21:19.280
In the same way, you start feeling 
the problems of other people, 

21:19.280 --> 21:27.760
and you talk the language of centres.
If you know how to cure your centres  

21:27.760 --> 21:32.560
and the centres of others,
imagine what miracles you can do! 

21:34.640 --> 21:39.760
If you see the problems of human beings 
– we can say, ecological problems, 

21:39.760 --> 21:50.720
health problems, all kinds of problems we have –
these are due to fundamentally human beings, 

21:50.720 --> 21:58.400
and due to fundamentally their centres
If you can put these centres right,  

21:58.400 --> 22:01.920
you can put human beings right,
as well  

22:02.560 --> 22:14.240
as you can put all the problems completely solved.
Like, I would like to tell you that in India, 

22:14.240 --> 22:19.280
there are three doctors in Delhi 
University who have got their MD. 

22:19.280 --> 22:31.120
Master of, they call it the medical, as MBBS.
Now they have doctorate in medicine in the curing, 

22:31.120 --> 22:41.040
about the curing of very incurable diseases.
No doubt, with Sahaja Yoga,  

22:41.040 --> 22:47.120
many incurable diseases have been cured,
even blood cancer and all that has been cured. 

22:47.120 --> 22:51.760
But at the very outset, I would like to tell you,
we are not here to cure people,  

22:51.760 --> 22:57.440
but make you all into doctors,
so that all of you can go round and cure. 

22:57.440 --> 23:04.480
Because single handed, how many people I can cure?
So it’s important that you all should  

23:04.480 --> 23:11.920
achieve your power of the Spirit,
by which you can enlighten the whole world. 

23:11.920 --> 23:20.960
It’s like one candle which is enlightened, 
can enlighten another candle very easily. 

23:20.960 --> 23:25.360
But surprisingly, people say, 
“But we can enlighten ourselves”. 

23:25.360 --> 23:30.320
How can a candle which is not 
enlightened, can enlighten itself? 

23:30.320 --> 23:35.840
It’s illogical.
But anybody who gets enlightenment,  

23:35.840 --> 23:42.720
any one of you who gets enlightenment,
can enlighten another person, because  

23:42.720 --> 23:50.720
you can raise the Kundalini of others.
You can give Realization to others. 

23:50.720 --> 23:58.080
You get these powers automatically within you,
for which, of course, I hope Bala has told you,  

23:58.080 --> 24:01.760
you cannot pay.
You cannot pay,  

24:01.760 --> 24:08.800
because it’s a living process of evolution.
How much did we pay to become human beings? 

24:08.800 --> 24:12.800
Or how much did we pay to this Mother 
Earth for giving us these flowers? 

24:12.800 --> 24:16.640
I mean, there’s a built-in quality in 
the Mother Earth that she can sprout, 

24:16.640 --> 24:24.400
and these plants also have a 
built-in capacity to produce flowers, 

24:24.400 --> 24:31.520
or a seed to become a plant.
All living process is done  

24:31.520 --> 24:36.480
without going to the bank,
without knowing about money. 

24:36.480 --> 24:41.120
This is the first thing you must 
understand, that you cannot pay for it. 

24:41.120 --> 24:50.320
It is so invaluable that you can’t pay for it.
It is so vital that it has to happen. 

24:50.320 --> 24:56.400
Especially now the time has come, 
I call it as the ‘Blossom Time’. 

24:56.400 --> 25:01.440
Some people say it’s the ‘Last Judgement’.
In Quran, it is written, it’s a  

25:01.440 --> 25:09.440
‘Qiyamah’ when your hands will speak.
All these- also there’s ‘Aquarius Age’, 

25:09.440 --> 25:13.760
‘Age of Enlightenment’, 
people talk of so many things. 

25:13.760 --> 25:17.600
But it’s talk, talk, talk. 
It’s just a lip service. 

25:17.600 --> 25:23.840
It has to happen. It has to be actualized.
Otherwise, you should not accept somebody  

25:23.840 --> 25:29.040
who is just giving a big sermon
and collecting money after that. 

25:29.040 --> 25:42.880
It is the experience that you all should have
and the powers that are bestowed by that. 

25:42.880 --> 25:48.000
As I told you, when the Spirit 
shines in your attention, 

25:48.000 --> 25:57.440
you become enlightened and your attention 
becomes enlightened and effective. 

25:57.440 --> 26:03.840
You start feeling another person, 
his centres on your fingertips, 

26:03.840 --> 26:08.320
and also the centres that are your own,
that self-knowledge you  

26:08.320 --> 26:20.160
feel it on your fingertips.
Now the second quality of the spirithood is this, 

26:20.160 --> 26:28.640
that you know the absolute truth.
Because Spirit is the source of truth. 

26:28.640 --> 26:36.800
Supposing now, somebody in India has 
been in jail and he’s released from jail. 

26:36.800 --> 26:40.480
He doesn’t know how to settle 
in Indian society, perhaps. 

26:40.480 --> 26:49.040
So he comes to Germany with all 
the necessary dress of a saint, 

26:49.040 --> 26:57.840
and people start following him. He makes money.
Nobody knows that he’s really the saint or not. 

26:57.840 --> 27:00.880
He talks big because in India, 
everybody reads all these books, 

27:00.880 --> 27:04.320
they can talk very big.
I’ll tell you lots of stories.  

27:04.320 --> 27:16.480
And one can believe what he’s talking.
But he is a thief or he’s a man who is  

27:16.480 --> 27:23.680
much less in spirituality than you are.
And he’s just looting you, using you, 

27:23.680 --> 27:31.840
using your money and calling himself a saint.
Till he’s completely exposed or discovered,  

27:31.840 --> 27:34.960
you follow that person.
But actually,  

27:34.960 --> 27:41.920
he is that or not, how will you find out?
Which is the way, which is the vehicle 

27:41.920 --> 27:49.360
by which you will know whether 
this man is real or not? 

27:49.360 --> 27:55.600
Because you do not know the absolute 
truth, whatever he tries to make up, 

27:55.600 --> 28:03.360
you fall prey to that.
When you are a Realized soul,  

28:03.360 --> 28:07.520
you put your hands towards such a person,
immediately you’ll start  

28:07.520 --> 28:16.800
getting terrible heat in the body
or maybe a blister might come also, for a while. 

28:16.800 --> 28:24.640
So you become a barometer of absolute truth.
There are many people who don’t believe in God. 

28:24.640 --> 28:30.320
Like I went to Russia, they said 
that, “Mother we believe in you”. 

28:30.320 --> 28:33.120
There are thousands and 
thousands in Russia, I must say. 

28:33.120 --> 28:38.480
The awakening of Russians is tremendous.
They are very sensitive to spirituality. 

28:38.480 --> 28:42.080
They won’t accept anybody 
false, somehow I don’t know why. 

28:42.080 --> 28:47.200
And they asked Me, “Mother we believe 
that you are there, you are something, 

28:47.200 --> 28:52.240
but how will you prove there is God?”
I said, “All right. You put your  

28:52.240 --> 28:56.720
hands and ask question:
is there God or not?” 

28:56.720 --> 29:00.560
And they started feeling the 
cool breeze in their hands 

29:00.560 --> 29:04.000
and tremendous cool breeze.
Then they said, “How are you  

29:04.000 --> 29:12.240
to believe that Christ was the Son of God?”
“All right, again you put up your hands and see”. 

29:12.240 --> 29:16.160
Even if you have ten small 
children who are Realized souls, 

29:16.160 --> 29:24.000
and if you tie up their eyes and ask them,
“Now what’s wrong with these gentlemen?” 

29:24.000 --> 29:29.680
They will all raise the same finger.
Supposing they raise this finger or this finger. 

29:29.680 --> 29:35.840
You ask, “Have you got some heart trouble?”
Immediately he’ll say, “How do you know?” 

29:35.840 --> 29:40.080
The diagnosis itself will be done 
by little children of ten years. 

29:40.080 --> 29:44.080
It is fantastic no doubt.
It is too fantastic that  

29:44.080 --> 29:56.400
people can believe. But you are fantastic!
Supposing I take a little box in an Indian village 

29:56.400 --> 30:02.240
and show them that this is called as television
and you can see all kinds of films in it. 

30:02.240 --> 30:07.360
They’ll say, “What, this box?”
We also all think we are just boxes. 

30:07.360 --> 30:12.080
But once you’ll put it to the mains, 
they will see how fantastic it is. 

30:12.080 --> 30:17.280
So, I’m talking about 
something which is metascience, 

30:17.280 --> 30:21.120
that the whole science is built-in 
within us, the whole knowledge. 

30:21.120 --> 30:28.480
And it starts manifesting and you are 
amazed how you can do all these things. 

30:29.520 --> 30:34.720
So the second thing is that 
you know the absolute truth. 

30:34.720 --> 30:37.920
Now what happens when we know the absolute truth? 

30:37.920 --> 30:47.920
We do not fall into any sects, 
into any kind of, you can say, 

30:47.920 --> 30:57.440
false type of enticements that we have.
Immediately, we know this is false. 

30:57.440 --> 31:05.280
But another great advantage is that 
when you know the absolute truth, 

31:05.280 --> 31:12.240
there is no question of fighting 
because everybody sees the same truth, 

31:12.240 --> 31:18.400
knows the same truth.
I used to tell them about Freud and they  

31:18.400 --> 31:23.280
didn’t like it very much at that time,
but now he’s exposed. 

31:23.280 --> 31:28.960
People have said, “Psychoanalysis 
is no vehicle, no way to know”. 

31:28.960 --> 31:33.520
So now, when he’s now exposed 
they’re agreeing to it. 

31:33.520 --> 31:37.840
But so many would not sit in 
my program because I said, 

31:37.840 --> 31:41.920
that “Freud has taken out some yarn out 
of his head and you have accepted it”. 

31:41.920 --> 31:46.480
There’s no reality in it.
So you know the reality and  

31:46.480 --> 31:51.520
all of you know the same reality,
so there’s no question of fighting,  

31:51.520 --> 31:53.920
no question arguing,
there are no dogmas,  

31:53.920 --> 32:00.560
there are no theories, nothing.
Everybody sees the same point of view. 

32:00.560 --> 32:10.000
So there will be no wars, there will 
be no quarrel, nothing of the kind. 

32:10.000 --> 32:15.600
So, this absolute truth is only 
known when you become the Spirit. 

32:15.600 --> 32:26.800
That’s a fact. Spirit is the universal being.
Now if Spirit is the universal being,  

32:26.800 --> 32:32.480
you become a universal being.
That means that you believe in all the  

32:32.480 --> 32:42.000
religions and you believe in all the prophets,
all the incarnations and you see the essence. 

32:42.000 --> 32:47.440
In every religion it’s the same,
and the indication is that  

32:47.440 --> 32:54.240
first you become a Realized soul.
Christ has said, “You have to be born again”. 

32:54.240 --> 33:02.000
Everybody has said the same thing.
But because of ignorance, because of  

33:02.000 --> 33:10.800
manipulation, we all fight in the name of God.
When you become the universal being,  

33:10.800 --> 33:21.840
you forget about races, about nations,
false religions, false things and you all  

33:21.840 --> 33:29.200
become absolutely congenial
with each other, and such a  

33:29.200 --> 33:37.360
rapport is established between people.
See now, what is the difference we have  

33:38.080 --> 33:41.200
between ourselves?
You cut the skin a  

33:41.200 --> 33:48.240
little bit, and you’ll find the same nerve,
the same muscle, the same bone in that part. 

33:48.240 --> 33:54.320
Whether it is in England or it 
is in Australia, India or Africa. 

33:54.320 --> 34:01.360
No difference, it’s just skin deep.
We smile the same way, laugh the same way,  

34:01.360 --> 34:08.720
cry the same way, feel the same way.
But still, we are not conscious. 

34:08.720 --> 34:14.080
This is not in awareness that 
we are all universal beings. 

34:14.080 --> 34:21.120
And what is there to fight in the name 
of these superficial skin-deep things? 

34:22.720 --> 34:36.320
So, what happens is this, that a kind of 
a great brotherhood starts emerging out. 

34:36.320 --> 34:43.840
We have programs in India once a year and 
about three thousand people you can see 

34:43.840 --> 34:52.880
and these three thousand people, 
they are from fifty-five countries. 

34:52.880 --> 34:55.600
You’d be amazed; they are 
from fifty-five countries. 

34:55.600 --> 34:59.840
I’ve never seen them quarrelling, 
fighting with any violence. 

34:59.840 --> 35:03.760
Even a football match you 
cannot see without a fight. 

35:03.760 --> 35:09.840
Here such love, such understanding; 
how they know each other, 

35:09.840 --> 35:14.160
how they understand each 
other, how they love each other 

35:14.160 --> 35:21.840
and how they intensely work for the 
benevolence of others is very remarkable. 

35:21.840 --> 35:30.720
When I first went to Russia, you’d be amazed, 
twenty-five German Sahaja Yogis came in. 

35:30.720 --> 35:39.200
And these twenty-five German Sahaja Yogis told Me,
when I asked them, “Why are you here?” 

35:39.200 --> 35:42.320
They said, “Mother, don’t you 
think it is our responsibility?” 

35:42.320 --> 35:49.040
I said, “No. Why? You didn’t do anything wrong.
Your forefathers might have done something wrong”. 

35:49.040 --> 35:53.680
“No, it’s our responsibility 
because they were our forefathers”. 

35:53.680 --> 35:58.480
And with great assiduity, even when I left Russia,
they were there and they worked it out. 

35:58.480 --> 36:03.040
And today, I must say 
spiritually, apart from India, 

36:03.040 --> 36:09.440
Russia is the strongest country.
But people are so sensitive. 

36:09.440 --> 36:18.800
I think we lost lot of our energy in 
choices and in the so-called freedom 

36:18.800 --> 36:20.960
and abandonment. 

36:20.960 --> 36:27.600
While their government might have been 
wrong, might have been not so good, 

36:27.600 --> 36:37.200
but the people are extremely simple and 
extremely loving, very affectionate. 

36:37.920 --> 36:48.800
I was so surprised the way there were:
thousands and thousands who got their Realization. 

36:48.800 --> 36:54.480
Here, I am very much surprised at our 
Mayor, here, that he has recognized Me. 

36:54.480 --> 37:00.880
The first time I think any Mayor who 
has really recognized Me in this way. 

37:00.880 --> 37:06.160
I am really must say Cincinnati must be 
some special place where they have done it. 

37:06.160 --> 37:10.480
Of course, in Italy, there are some 
Mayors in small, small villages 

37:10.480 --> 37:15.920
who have tremendous respect for Me.
But this kind of thing, proclamation,  

37:15.920 --> 37:19.760
is such a surprise to Me,
shows that in this place,  

37:19.760 --> 37:26.080
Cincinnati, there is an awareness
that we need transformation. 

37:26.080 --> 37:29.840
With transformation, not 
only your physical, mental, 

37:29.840 --> 37:33.120
emotional problems are solved, 
but material problems are solved. 

37:33.680 --> 37:42.560
Agriculture improves such a lot because 
these vibrated things like water 

37:42.560 --> 37:50.560
and all that, when you give it to the 
crops, we have seen it has grown ten times. 

37:51.360 --> 37:57.200
We have some doctors of agriculture 
who have experimented with it, 

37:57.200 --> 38:04.240
and have been trying to publish a book about it.
Not only agriculture but so many  

38:04.240 --> 38:10.320
other things like, we can say,
the ecological problem you have,  

38:10.320 --> 38:15.120
the trees which were dying with the acid rain
have been saved,  

38:15.120 --> 38:23.600
and they are emitting very good air
to counterbalance the ecological problem. 

38:23.600 --> 38:28.400
So many things can be done once 
you have this force working in you. 

38:28.400 --> 38:33.040
It is there, it’s your own for 
which you don’t have to pay, 

38:33.040 --> 38:41.280
just you have to have desire to have it.
It’s so simple as that. 

38:41.280 --> 38:48.160
But I don’t know why, one lady told Me 
in the plane, she was American, that, 

38:48.160 --> 38:52.400
“We have had so many hoaxes that 
Mother maybe they don’t believe you”. 

38:52.400 --> 38:58.640
But no, I was the first to come here.
But I was surprised the way they said to Me that, 

38:58.640 --> 39:01.320
“We won’t believe you unless 
and till you take money”. 

39:01.320 --> 39:10.560
“So, what’s that?”
Another thing, they said, “How can it be so easy? 

39:10.560 --> 39:16.560
But if it is so, suppose, I mean 
I am saying that just to believe, 

39:16.560 --> 39:21.200
there is a diamond kept here. 
I say, “It’s a real diamond”. 

39:21.200 --> 39:25.840
Won’t you all rush to take it?
But if I am saying, “It is so easy”,  

39:25.840 --> 39:29.600
on this point they wouldn’t accept.
You shouldn’t eat food like this,  

39:29.600 --> 39:34.560
but should go round and eat like that.
Otherwise, you cannot. They believe you  

39:34.560 --> 39:38.800
must suffer before you get spiritually.
I said, “You have suffered enough now. 

39:38.800 --> 39:44.480
And believe Me, you don’t have to suffer”.
They think you have to go to Himalayas and  

39:44.480 --> 39:49.680
stand on your head and starve yourself
or go to the desert and get nirvana. 

39:49.680 --> 39:54.560
In any way you die, so you call it, 
death is nirvana, you can get it. 

39:54.560 --> 39:59.600
All these kinds of ideas they gave Me I 
just, I didn’t know what to talk to them. 

39:59.600 --> 40:05.840
And all sorts of false people 
invaded, not only Indians, 

40:05.840 --> 40:12.880
Americans, Portuguese, all sorts of 
people invaded and they succumbed to them. 

40:12.880 --> 40:15.760
I didn’t come to America for 
nine years for the same reason. 

40:15.760 --> 40:23.360
I thought now their ideas about truth are so funny
that you have to go to Himalayas  

40:23.360 --> 40:28.960
or you must do this and do that,
that I will never be able to really work it out. 

40:28.960 --> 40:35.520
After nine years, Sahaja Yogis told Me,
“Now Mother it’s changing, you’d better come”. 

40:35.520 --> 40:39.760
So, I came.
And Cincinnati, I was here three years back. 

40:39.760 --> 40:44.640
I’m sorry, I should have come out 
here, but I’ve been very busy. 

40:44.640 --> 40:53.840
South America is also very well in spirituality.
They are very faithful, simple people. 

40:53.840 --> 41:00.320
I don’t say that complicated people don’t 
get Realization, they do, all of them. 

41:00.320 --> 41:04.320
But complicated people have 
to devote little more time 

41:04.320 --> 41:09.360
to get this connection all right.
Like, you see, any complicated machinery, 

41:09.360 --> 41:13.920
if it goes out of order you have 
to pay more attention to it. 

41:14.720 --> 41:19.920
In the same way, once you get your Realization, 

41:19.920 --> 41:26.720
you have to come to the collective.
Collective means that everybody is there  

41:26.720 --> 41:30.640
who knows all about Sahaja Yoga
and you must master it. 

41:30.640 --> 41:36.800
That also is free, absolutely 
free, you don’t have to pay for it. 

41:36.800 --> 41:41.520
You should have all the knowledge 
about this subtle system 

41:41.520 --> 41:50.160
and you should get all the powers that 
are within you which can manifest. 

41:50.160 --> 41:58.560
This is only my desire for which I’m 
running day and night all over the world. 

41:58.560 --> 42:06.240
As they said, it’s true that on 
one side, I have a very good family 

42:06.240 --> 42:12.960
and a very good husband, I have grandchildren 
and I’m myself seventy years of age. 

42:12.960 --> 42:18.240
So, you can imagine, I’m still 
travelling and doing all this work. 

42:18.240 --> 42:22.640
Because even my family thinks 
that it’s very important. 

42:22.640 --> 42:28.240
That transformation must take place so 
that there’s a complete emancipation 

42:28.240 --> 42:35.760
of human beings.
And people should transform,  

42:35.760 --> 42:40.080
to transform the whole world
and this is a very special time. 

42:40.080 --> 42:48.800
I hope people from Cincinnati will respond 
to it and will get their Self-realization. 

42:48.800 --> 43:04.160
We’ll take about ten to fifteen minutes for that.
And those who do not want to have their  

43:04.160 --> 43:10.240
Self-realization should leave the house,
should leave the place. 

43:10.240 --> 43:17.520
Because I cannot force, it’s your 
freedom to get your Realization. 

43:17.520 --> 43:21.600
If you don’t want it, you are free.
If you want to enter into the  

43:21.600 --> 43:26.960
Kingdom of God, you can.
If you don’t want, you cannot. 

43:26.960 --> 43:35.520
Because this is the work of divine 
love, nothing can be forced. 

43:35.520 --> 43:47.360
And this compassion that is flowing as the 
divine love will not force anything on you. 

43:47.360 --> 43:52.720
It respects your freedom.
So, I have to humbly request  

43:52.720 --> 44:02.560
you those who do not want to have Realization
should leave the place and should not, in any way, 

44:02.560 --> 44:25.840
disturb others who want to have it.
But definitely, I would request you not  

44:25.840 --> 44:31.040
to disturb when we are in the process
of our meditation,  

44:31.040 --> 44:39.600
which takes about ten minutes only.
As I told you, it’s a collective happening, 

44:39.600 --> 44:48.680
and you have to come to the collective 
to work it out and to know about it. 

44:50.720 --> 45:03.440
In that, you’ll be amazed how you will grow fast
and you’ll understand each and every thing. 

45:03.440 --> 45:11.520
I’m sure you must be having lots 
of questions also in your mind. 

45:11.520 --> 45:18.000
As I’m here only for one day, I would 
say that you should write your questions, 

45:18.000 --> 45:24.240
and send them over, and I’ll try to answer them. 

45:24.240 --> 45:31.360
Tomorrow I’m going away to Canada.
And I’ll be back again after one year. 

45:31.360 --> 45:38.560
I promise, I’ll be here for 
a longer period next time. 

45:49.920 --> 45:56.800
Now there are three conditions which I 
must tell you, which are very simple. 

45:59.200 --> 46:08.560
The first condition is that you 
have to be absolutely confident 

46:08.560 --> 46:16.800
that you all are going to get 
your Self-Realization tonight. 

46:16.800 --> 46:24.160
Absolutely confident, don’t doubt yourself. 

46:28.240 --> 46:43.840
So the second one follows that you should 
not feel guilty at all at this moment here. 

46:43.840 --> 46:52.320
After all, you are human beings, you are not gods.
And human beings can only make mistakes, isn’t it? 

46:53.280 --> 46:57.040
And this All-pervading Power 
about which I’m talking to you, 

46:57.040 --> 47:03.760
which is going to work out your 
Self-realization, is the ocean of forgiveness, 

47:03.760 --> 47:12.080
and very powerful ocean of forgiveness.
And whatever mistakes you might have committed,  

47:12.080 --> 47:21.680
it can dissolve everything.
So, don’t feel guilty at all,  

47:22.640 --> 47:29.040
and this idea of being sinner and all that,
just forget it. 

47:29.040 --> 47:35.120
If you are the seeker of truth, 
it’s your right to get your yoga, 

47:35.120 --> 47:42.560
your union with the Divine. It’s your right.
‘Sahaja’: ‘saha’ means ‘with you’  

47:42.560 --> 47:48.960
is born’-’ja’ is born –
this right to get this union. 

47:48.960 --> 47:55.440
So please, don’t feel guilty.
I must tell you very frankly,  

47:55.440 --> 48:00.720
when you feel guilty,
the center on the left side here catches. 

48:00.720 --> 48:07.520
As a result you might get 
spondylitis, you might get angina. 

48:07.520 --> 48:16.400
Also your system, the organs, 
might become lethargic. 

48:16.400 --> 48:20.080
So no use feeling guilty, what’s the use?
If you have made mistakes, you think  

48:20.080 --> 48:23.280
you have made really mistakes,
just face it and finish it off. 

48:23.280 --> 48:29.840
But don’t carry it all here.
But it has become a fashion, I tell you. 

48:29.840 --> 48:33.440
One lady told Me, “I feel 
very guilty for Afghanistan”. 

48:33.440 --> 48:37.040
I said, “What are you, Afghani?” “No”.
“Then are you Russian?” “No”. 

48:37.040 --> 48:48.640
“Then why are you feeling?” “I’m just feeling”.
So please, in short, you have to be placed very  

48:48.640 --> 48:51.360
pleasantly towards yourself,
very, very pleasantly. 

48:59.760 --> 49:09.840
Then the third one is a 
very, very simple condition, 

49:09.840 --> 49:14.880
is that you have to forgive everyone 
without thinking about them.
