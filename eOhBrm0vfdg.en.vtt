WEBVTT

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:44.597
Oh I thank you very much,

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:46.900
all of you, for coming.

00:03:58.204 --> 00:04:02.141
Mayor of Cincinnati

00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:05.144
has declared today

00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:08.514
as "Shri Mataji Day" in Cincinnati.

00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:21.194
And I will read this proclamation

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:23.696
which I am very thrilled about because,

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:25.698
somebody would know that

00:04:25.798 --> 00:04:27.600
Shri Mataji is an international figure.

00:04:28.401 --> 00:04:30.403
She is a diplomat.

00:04:30.403 --> 00:04:34.007
Her husband has been the Secretary General

00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:38.711
of a very large United Nations
organization.

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:42.515
He has been knighted by the Queen of England.

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:46.185
He has received the highest awards

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:49.355
from many, many nations

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:51.190
and he is

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.993
one of the living legends in the world today.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.030
His name is Sir C.P. Shrivastava

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.798
and Shri Mataji, herself,

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:01.801
has been honored, all over the world.

00:05:02.902 --> 00:05:05.905
And it's my pleasure to read this proclamation.

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.075
It says: "We proclaim

00:05:09.075 --> 00:05:10.610
whereas

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.613
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, "The Mother,"

00:05:14.247 --> 00:05:16.883
is recognized internationally

00:05:16.883 --> 00:05:21.087
as the most significant spiritual force
in the world today.

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:24.324
And she will awaken in us

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:28.194
the force that will change our lives
and that change the world.

00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:31.497
And whereas,

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:33.766
The United Nations honor her

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:35.735
with a U.N. Peace Medal.

00:05:36.302 --> 00:05:40.039
And whereas, Shri Mataji has developed

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:43.042
A simple meditation technique,

00:05:43.042 --> 00:05:44.944
"Sahaja Yoga"

00:05:44.944 --> 00:05:47.480
which enables the en masse

00:05:47.747 --> 00:05:50.016
experience of self-realization.

00:05:50.583 --> 00:05:53.453
Breakthrough of the new awareness.

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:54.787
And whereas,

00:05:54.787 --> 00:05:56.956
Sahaja Yoga

00:05:56.956 --> 00:06:00.059
is the next evolutionary step
for humanity

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.230
which can bring the transformation
of human consciousness

00:06:04.597 --> 00:06:06.666
to a higher level.

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:09.669
And whereas, the city of Cincinnati,

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:11.404
is honored

00:06:11.404 --> 00:06:14.407
by the visit of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi

00:06:14.607 --> 00:06:17.610
who will introduce through Sahaja Yoga

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:20.880
the experience of harmonious well-being,

00:06:21.614 --> 00:06:23.916
and inner transformation

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:26.919
that can lead us out of the confusion and frustration

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:28.788
of modern living

00:06:28.788 --> 00:06:33.192
and spark the greatest inner transformation yet seen.

00:06:33.993 --> 00:06:35.495
Now therefore,

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:38.498
I, Dwight Tillery, mayor of the City of Cincinnati

00:06:39.198 --> 00:06:44.637
do hereby proclaim Thursday, September 10th, 1992,

00:06:45.538 --> 00:06:50.643
as "Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi Day,"
in Cincinnati.

00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:20.840
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:34.053
At the very outset

00:07:34.053 --> 00:07:36.122
we have to know

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:39.125
that truth is what it is.

00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:42.261
We cannot change it.

00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:43.996
We cannot

00:07:43.996 --> 00:07:46.732
conceptualize it.

00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:50.736
Unfortunately, at this human level,

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:54.307
we cannot feel it.

00:07:54.874 --> 00:07:57.710
We have to become

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:00.713
something more.

00:08:02.715 --> 00:08:05.718
Unless and until

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:09.322
that happens to us

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:11.557
we cannot know the truth.

00:08:11.557 --> 00:08:14.560
The absolute truth.

00:08:15.428 --> 00:08:18.397
I call you all as seekers of truth.

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:23.236
And if you are seekers of truth,

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.273
you have to open your mind like scientists

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.410
and treat
whatever I'm telling you as a hypothesis.

00:08:32.378 --> 00:08:38.317
And if it works, you should accept
and grow in it.

00:08:39.452 --> 00:08:42.722
You have been already told, I think, about

00:08:43.055 --> 00:08:48.261
the subtle system
that is built in within us.

00:08:48.995 --> 00:08:51.397
This system has been built in

00:08:51.397 --> 00:08:54.400
during our evolutionary process.

00:08:56.736 --> 00:09:00.006
Whatever is the truth has to be tangible.

00:09:01.674 --> 00:09:06.212
It should not be accepted blindfolded
because I am telling you.

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:12.985
You have to verify yourself that whatever
I'm telling you is the truth

00:09:13.286 --> 00:09:19.659
because you will have the actualization
of the experience of the truth.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.929
That is,

00:09:22.929 --> 00:09:24.664
firstly,

00:09:24.664 --> 00:09:27.667
that you are not this body, this mind,

00:09:30.036 --> 00:09:33.239
this ego, conditionings,

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:37.209
but you are the pure spirit.

00:09:37.677 --> 00:09:40.680
This is the first truth about yourself.

00:09:41.347 --> 00:09:44.317
And the second one is that

00:09:45.217 --> 00:09:49.956
there is an all pervading
power of divine love,

00:09:50.523 --> 00:09:54.961
which they call by different names.
They may call it "Rūḥ."

00:09:54.961 --> 00:10:00.132
They may call it "God's Divine Love."
They may call it the Holy, the

00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:04.670
"Cool breeze of the Holy Spirit."

00:10:05.738 --> 00:10:11.210
They may call it "Paramchaitanya."
Call it by any name.

00:10:11.744 --> 00:10:14.747
But that is such a subtle

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:18.284
force energy which exists,

00:10:18.351 --> 00:10:21.354
which does all the living work.

00:10:23.656 --> 00:10:25.958
Here now you see flowers.

00:10:26.258 --> 00:10:30.830
Flowers, so beautiful

00:10:30.863 --> 00:10:33.866
and we take them for granted.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.903
You don't question
how this miracle has taken place.

00:10:39.438 --> 00:10:42.174
Look at your eyes.

00:10:44.777 --> 00:10:50.816
We don't question how this camera
has come to exist.

00:10:51.417 --> 00:10:56.455
Look at your brain - what a computer it is.
You never question it

00:10:56.856 --> 00:11:00.893
how it has come to us,
how we have become human beings

00:11:01.193 --> 00:11:04.797
and how all these things are

00:11:07.199 --> 00:11:11.203
working within us automatically.

00:11:13.939 --> 00:11:16.942
If you ask who runs our heart,

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.413
the doctors would say
it's an autonomous system.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:25.551
But if you go further and ask who is this "auto"?

00:11:26.152 --> 00:11:29.155
Who is running this heart?

00:11:29.755 --> 00:11:34.360
There are so many questions
which cannot be answered by science,

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.663
and science is not conclusive.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:42.268
Recently, I was reading a book,
"The Limits of Science,"

00:11:43.002 --> 00:11:46.672
and he has asked
three questions in that book:

00:11:47.239 --> 00:11:52.678
"How do I come to be a human being?"
It's the first question.

00:11:53.145 --> 00:11:57.950
Second is: "What is the purpose of my life?"

00:11:58.584 --> 00:12:03.556
And (third): "Why should I live any longer?"

00:12:04.056 --> 00:12:09.161
All these three questions
can be very easily answered

00:12:09.695 --> 00:12:14.934
once you become the spirit.

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:22.675
This transformation is also called
by many names.

00:12:23.042 --> 00:12:25.911
People call it "self-realization."

00:12:25.911 --> 00:12:28.581
Some call it "selfhood."

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:31.550
Some say "self-knowledge."

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:36.455
But what is this "self"
they are talking about and

00:12:36.689 --> 00:12:40.426
what will happen if we get the "selfhood"?

00:12:42.928 --> 00:12:47.833
I have to tell you, that all of you

00:12:48.167 --> 00:12:52.104
have got your divinity within yourself.

00:12:52.705 --> 00:12:58.144
And surprisingly, it is absolutely intact.

00:12:58.444 --> 00:13:02.381
Whatever you might have done,

00:13:02.648 --> 00:13:05.384
whatever mistakes
you might have committed,

00:13:05.384 --> 00:13:08.287
your divinity is absolutely intact.

00:13:08.287 --> 00:13:11.290
It is not at all disturbed, cannot be perished,

00:13:11.857 --> 00:13:17.296
cannot be perished, cannot be destroyed
by anything.

00:13:17.596 --> 00:13:20.332
The reason is:

00:13:20.666 --> 00:13:27.206
This Divinity is eternal,

00:13:27.406 --> 00:13:31.510
and whatever is eternal cannot be harmed.

00:13:31.844 --> 00:13:33.746
Nobody can destroy it.

00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:36.649
And that is within you there.

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:39.819
And sometimes the glimpse of that
may be that

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:45.057
you think whatever you see,
there must be something beyond.

00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:48.127
And when you start thinking that,
then you become

00:13:48.127 --> 00:13:52.765
a seeker of truth.

00:13:53.065 --> 00:13:56.302
Surprising, in these modern times,

00:13:56.535 --> 00:14:01.006
there are so many,
so many seekers of truth

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.543
and so many are lost.

00:14:05.945 --> 00:14:08.948
When we start seeking truth,

00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:14.453
we definitely have to put faith into something.

00:14:14.753 --> 00:14:17.756
When we put our faith into religion also,

00:14:17.923 --> 00:14:21.160
what do we find that religion is

00:14:21.827 --> 00:14:24.830
power oriented or money oriented.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:28.133
So there is fundamentalism.

00:14:30.569 --> 00:14:33.572
Whatever attitude people might have taken

00:14:34.506 --> 00:14:37.142
those who started this religion

00:14:37.142 --> 00:14:40.446
are immaculate people, they are divine people

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:45.951
and they were like the flowers
on one tree of spirituality.

00:14:46.552 --> 00:14:50.589
Only we have plucked these flowers
and we are fighting.

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:54.193
How can we fight in the name of God?

00:14:55.427 --> 00:14:58.664
One should reason it out and once you reason it out,

00:14:58.664 --> 00:15:02.501
you start thinking:
"There must be something more to it."

00:15:02.868 --> 00:15:05.871
So when this..

00:15:06.939 --> 00:15:09.942
residual force, we call it as "Kundalini" in India.

00:15:10.242 --> 00:15:11.844
Kundalini means coils,

00:15:12.244 --> 00:15:14.280
starts rising,

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.716
it passes through six centers

00:15:17.716 --> 00:15:21.320
and pierces through the seventh one,

00:15:22.721 --> 00:15:25.758
Which we call as "Brahmarandra"

00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:28.327
on the fontanel bone area,

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:31.931
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

00:15:32.498 --> 00:15:35.734
And this opens.

00:15:37.836 --> 00:15:40.873
It is the actualization of your baptism.

00:15:40.906 --> 00:15:47.046
It is not just I put my hand on
your head and say: "Now you are baptized."

00:15:47.246 --> 00:15:51.517
This kind of self-certificate
is not going to help us.

00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:53.719
Now, if you become..

00:15:54.119 --> 00:15:58.324
say, the governor of this place,
then you have certain powers.

00:15:58.624 --> 00:16:03.128
Now, if you become the self
or if you become the self realized soul,

00:16:03.395 --> 00:16:05.864
then you must have some powers.

00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:08.033
And..

00:16:08.334 --> 00:16:13.539
people, normally,
certify themselves as this and that.

00:16:14.006 --> 00:16:17.142
This is not the way
you can achieve that state.

00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:22.114
You have to be honest,
because if you are honest seekers,

00:16:22.748 --> 00:16:25.250
then you should expect

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.553
the actualization of the experience,

00:16:27.553 --> 00:16:32.191
first thing, about which Thomas
has written in his treatise.

00:16:32.224 --> 00:16:36.595
I wish you could read the Gospel
of Thomas, in which he has clearly said

00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:39.832
that the experience of self-realization

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:43.802
is the most important thing,
and that it's to be achieved.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.673
You must be knowing Thomas ran away,

00:16:47.873 --> 00:16:50.809
because I think Paul
was trying to dominate him

00:16:50.809 --> 00:16:52.611
or whatever it was,

00:16:52.611 --> 00:16:54.747
and ultimately he went to India.

00:16:54.747 --> 00:16:59.284
But before going there, he went to Egypt
and he put all his treatise in a jar.

00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:01.887
For 50 years

00:17:01.887 --> 00:17:06.058
they have been trying to put it in
common language.

00:17:06.058 --> 00:17:09.061
And now the book is out, partly.

00:17:09.561 --> 00:17:12.798
So, this experience..

00:17:14.533 --> 00:17:18.103
has to be there, that you feel your spirit

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:23.042
and feel this all pervading power

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:25.044
all around us.

00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:27.946
So far, you have not felt it.

00:17:27.946 --> 00:17:30.215
So we have to be

00:17:30.215 --> 00:17:31.850
humble about it.

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.853
As Christ has said, meek in heart

00:17:35.687 --> 00:17:37.956
will inherit the earth.

00:17:37.956 --> 00:17:40.959
That's a fact.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.630
You have to be meek about it that

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:51.503
so far we have not found the truth
and that this divinity is within us,

00:17:52.271 --> 00:17:55.808
which is going to connect us to that

00:17:55.808 --> 00:17:58.777
all pervading power by which

00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:02.014
we are going to know the truth.

00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:05.317
Apart from

00:18:05.317 --> 00:18:08.120
many other

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.321
benefits that

00:18:09.321 --> 00:18:12.724
you get by the awakening of this force within you.

00:18:14.226 --> 00:18:17.229
One, your physical

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.632
conditions improve.

00:18:20.632 --> 00:18:23.435
Once you come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:23.435 --> 00:18:26.605
you are amazed
how your diseases are improved.

00:18:26.672 --> 00:18:30.209
Here in Cincinnati,
one lady who was suffering from cancer

00:18:30.209 --> 00:18:31.977
got cured.

00:18:31.977 --> 00:18:35.247
But curing people is a funny job.

00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:38.851
Once you cure them, they just disappear.

00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:40.352
They're very happy, they write to you:

00:18:40.352 --> 00:18:43.155
"Thank you very much, you cured us."

00:18:43.155 --> 00:18:46.859
But they're not the ones
who give light to others.

00:18:47.259 --> 00:18:50.262
Secondly,
mentally, people improve very much.

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:53.465
All the habits

00:18:53.465 --> 00:18:56.468
which are destructive,
which we have acquired

00:18:56.902 --> 00:18:59.004
in anyway.

00:18:59.004 --> 00:19:02.007
They disappear and disappear

00:19:02.608 --> 00:19:04.409
so fast,

00:19:04.409 --> 00:19:07.179
that I have known people in England

00:19:07.179 --> 00:19:10.149
that overnight

00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:13.352
they gave up drugs, overnight.

00:19:15.087 --> 00:19:18.357
Today they are beautiful people,
professionals, working very well.

00:19:18.357 --> 00:19:20.826
This, I'm telling you

00:19:20.826 --> 00:19:23.829
in the year 1970 was happening

00:19:24.696 --> 00:19:26.098
in England.

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:29.134
Or say '74, especially,

00:19:29.501 --> 00:19:33.038
in a big group, it happened.

00:19:34.706 --> 00:19:35.307
Then,

00:19:35.307 --> 00:19:38.310
the second advantage is that

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:43.048
that you find your own spirit.

00:19:44.383 --> 00:19:48.253
Your spirit shines in your attention.

00:19:49.821 --> 00:19:52.824
Thus your attention becomes active.

00:19:54.593 --> 00:19:56.328
Like the light.

00:19:56.328 --> 00:19:58.597
Now there is a light here.

00:19:58.597 --> 00:20:01.400
When it falls on something
you can see it clearly,

00:20:01.667 --> 00:20:03.502
but it doesn't act on that.

00:20:03.502 --> 00:20:05.771
Maybe a little bit,

00:20:05.771 --> 00:20:10.709
it might, sort of spoil it,
but it doesn't act.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:14.313
But when your attention

00:20:14.746 --> 00:20:17.749
is enlightened,

00:20:17.849 --> 00:20:22.087
then wherever you put your attention, it acts

00:20:22.287 --> 00:20:25.290
that means on your hands also,

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:28.794
you find this cool breeze blowing,

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.796
and the fingertips,

00:20:30.796 --> 00:20:33.232
which are the sympathetic nervous endings,

00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:35.133
become enlightened.

00:20:35.133 --> 00:20:37.336
So five, six and seven.

00:20:37.336 --> 00:20:42.841
These centers on the left and the seven
centers on the right get enlightened

00:20:43.208 --> 00:20:47.179
and you immediately know
what's wrong with you.

00:20:47.346 --> 00:20:51.316
And also you can find out
what's wrong with others.

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:55.988
So, what has happened to your attention is that

00:20:55.988 --> 00:20:58.991
you have got a new awareness

00:20:59.057 --> 00:21:02.060
where you become collectively conscious.

00:21:03.829 --> 00:21:05.497
Who is the other?

00:21:05.497 --> 00:21:08.467
When the microcosm becomes the macrocosm,

00:21:09.301 --> 00:21:12.971
when a drop becomes the ocean,
it becomes the ocean.

00:21:13.572 --> 00:21:16.575
In the same way, you start feeling

00:21:17.542 --> 00:21:19.878
the problems of other people,

00:21:19.878 --> 00:21:22.881
and you talk the language of centers.

00:21:24.583 --> 00:21:26.518
If you know how

00:21:26.518 --> 00:21:29.621
to cure your centers
and the centers of others,

00:21:30.656 --> 00:21:33.659
imagine what miracles you can do.

00:21:35.193 --> 00:21:38.130
If you see the problems of human beings,

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:42.501
we can say ecological problems,
health problems, all kinds of problems

00:21:42.501 --> 00:21:45.170
we have.

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:49.374
These are due
to fundamentally human beings

00:21:51.243 --> 00:21:54.246
and due to fundamentally, their centers.

00:21:55.113 --> 00:21:58.116
If you can put these centers right,

00:21:58.917 --> 00:22:01.720
you can put human beings right

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:06.625
as well as you can put all the problems

00:22:07.659 --> 00:22:10.662
completely solved.

00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.663
Like,

00:22:11.763 --> 00:22:14.766
I would like to tell you that in India,

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:19.338
there are three doctors in Delhi
university who have got their M.D.

00:22:19.771 --> 00:22:21.139
Master of,

00:22:21.139 --> 00:22:24.676
they call it the, in the medical, as the MBBS.

00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:27.679
Now they have doctorate in medicine.

00:22:29.948 --> 00:22:33.885
In the curing, about the curing of

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.323
very incurable diseases,

00:22:38.323 --> 00:22:41.326
no doubt in Sahaja Yoga

00:22:41.493 --> 00:22:44.496
many incurable diseases have been cured,

00:22:44.563 --> 00:22:47.199
even blood cancer
and all that has been cured.

00:22:47.366 --> 00:22:49.768
But at the very outset,
I would like to tell you,

00:22:49.768 --> 00:22:54.339
we are not here to cure people,
but to make you all into doctors

00:22:55.173 --> 00:22:57.743
so that all of you can go around and cure.

00:22:57.743 --> 00:23:02.114
Because, single handed,
how many people I can cure?

00:23:02.314 --> 00:23:05.517
So it's important that you all should achieve

00:23:05.517 --> 00:23:08.520
your power of the spirit

00:23:08.653 --> 00:23:11.823
by which you can enlighten
the whole world.

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:18.096
It's like one candle which is enlightened
can enlighten another..

00:23:19.164 --> 00:23:21.400
candle very easily.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:25.771
But surprisingly, people say:
"But we can enlighten ourselves."

00:23:25.837 --> 00:23:30.475
How can a candle,
which is not enlightened, can enlighten itself?

00:23:30.475 --> 00:23:32.677
It's illogical.

00:23:33.044 --> 00:23:36.047
But anybody who gets enlightenment,

00:23:36.381 --> 00:23:38.517
anyone of you

00:23:38.517 --> 00:23:42.287
who gets enlightenment
can enlighten another person,

00:23:42.721 --> 00:23:45.724
because you can raise the Kundalini of others.

00:23:46.958 --> 00:23:49.961
You can give realization to others.

00:23:51.163 --> 00:23:54.499
You get these powers automatically within you.

00:23:54.666 --> 00:24:00.372
For which of course,
I hope Bala has told you, you cannot pay.

00:24:00.372 --> 00:24:01.940
You cannot pay

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.677
because it's a living process of evolution.

00:24:05.811 --> 00:24:08.814
How much did we pay
to become human beings?

00:24:09.414 --> 00:24:12.818
Or how much do we pay to this Mother Earth
for giving us these flowers?

00:24:13.051 --> 00:24:16.855
I mean, there's a built-in quality
in the Mother Earth that she can sprout,

00:24:17.222 --> 00:24:21.126
and these plants also have a built-in

00:24:21.626 --> 00:24:25.030
capacity to produce flowers

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:28.033
or a seed to become a plant.

00:24:29.067 --> 00:24:32.037
All living process is done

00:24:32.037 --> 00:24:34.739
without going to the bank,

00:24:34.739 --> 00:24:37.042
without knowing about money.

00:24:37.042 --> 00:24:40.946
This is the first thing you must
understand that you cannot pay for it.

00:24:41.646 --> 00:24:44.382
It is so invaluable
that you can't pay for it.

00:24:44.382 --> 00:24:47.385
It is so vital.

00:24:48.186 --> 00:24:50.755
That it has to happen,

00:24:50.755 --> 00:24:53.959
especially now the time has come.

00:24:53.959 --> 00:24:56.795
I call it as the "Blossom Time."

00:24:56.795 --> 00:24:59.798
Some people say, it's the "Last Judgment."

00:25:00.198 --> 00:25:01.633
In Quran, it is written

00:25:01.633 --> 00:25:04.703
it's a "qiyāmah," when your hands will speak.

00:25:05.136 --> 00:25:09.241
All these, or also there is "Aquarius Age,"

00:25:09.241 --> 00:25:13.478
"Age of Enlightenment,"
people talk of so many things.

00:25:13.845 --> 00:25:18.250
But it's talk, talk, talk.
It's just a lip service.

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:21.887
It has to happen, this has to be actualized.

00:25:21.887 --> 00:25:26.491
Otherwise, you should not accept somebody
who is just giving a big sermon

00:25:26.958 --> 00:25:29.194
and collecting money after that.

00:25:29.194 --> 00:25:31.396
It is..

00:25:32.297 --> 00:25:35.734
the experience that you all should have

00:25:36.401 --> 00:25:41.306
and the powers that are bestowed by that.

00:25:42.741 --> 00:25:47.979
As I told you,
when the spirit shines in your attention,

00:25:48.547 --> 00:25:51.550
you become enlightened

00:25:51.616 --> 00:25:54.619
and your attention becomes enlightened

00:25:55.053 --> 00:25:57.956
and effective.

00:25:57.956 --> 00:26:00.959
You start feeling another person,

00:26:01.159 --> 00:26:04.162
his centers on your fingertips

00:26:04.296 --> 00:26:07.732
and also the centers that are your own.

00:26:07.832 --> 00:26:12.337
That self-knowledge, you feel it on your fingertips.

00:26:15.006 --> 00:26:19.144
Now the second quality of the spirithood is this:

00:26:20.679 --> 00:26:23.682
that you know the absolute truth.

00:26:24.249 --> 00:26:28.453
Because spirit is the source of truth.

00:26:29.054 --> 00:26:32.057
Supposing now somebody

00:26:32.424 --> 00:26:35.293
in India has been in jail

00:26:35.293 --> 00:26:40.665
and he is released from jail, he doesn't know
how to settle in Indian society, perhaps.

00:26:40.966 --> 00:26:43.969
So he comes to Germany with a

00:26:44.936 --> 00:26:48.473
all the necessary dress of a saint

00:26:49.641 --> 00:26:52.310
and people start following him.

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:54.212
Him, It's funny.

00:26:54.212 --> 00:26:57.782
Nobody knows that
he is really the saint or not.

00:26:58.416 --> 00:27:00.518
He talks big because in India everybody

00:27:00.518 --> 00:27:02.654
reads all these books.
They can talk very big

00:27:02.754 --> 00:27:04.956
and tell you lots of stories

00:27:04.956 --> 00:27:07.926
and one can believe what he is talking.

00:27:08.093 --> 00:27:11.096
But he is a thief

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:14.966
or he is a man who is

00:27:16.901 --> 00:27:19.904
much less in spirituality than you are,

00:27:20.205 --> 00:27:22.707
and he is just looting you,

00:27:22.707 --> 00:27:25.710
using you, using your money

00:27:25.944 --> 00:27:28.947
and calling himself a saint.

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.150
Till he is completely exposed
or discovered,

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:34.686
you follow that person.

00:27:34.686 --> 00:27:37.122
But actually he is that or not

00:27:37.122 --> 00:27:40.025
how will you find out?

00:27:40.025 --> 00:27:42.460
Which is the way, which is the vehicle

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:46.531
by which you will know
whether this man is real or not?

00:27:49.768 --> 00:27:52.771
Because you do not know
the absolute truth.

00:27:53.438 --> 00:27:56.107
Whatever he tries to make up

00:27:56.107 --> 00:27:59.110
you follow prey to that.

00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:03.014
When you are a realized soul,

00:28:03.448 --> 00:28:06.951
you put your hands towards such a person.

00:28:07.185 --> 00:28:10.188
Immediately you'll start getting
terrible heat in the body,

00:28:10.221 --> 00:28:13.158
or maybe a blister might come also.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:18.396
How do I so become so

00:28:18.396 --> 00:28:21.900
You become a barometer of absolute truth.

00:28:22.934 --> 00:28:25.170
There are many people
who don't believe in God.

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:27.338
Like I went to Russia.

00:28:27.338 --> 00:28:30.075
They said that: "Mother we believe in you."

00:28:30.341 --> 00:28:33.011
There's thousands and thousands in Russia, I must say.

00:28:33.011 --> 00:28:35.847
The awakening of Russians is tremendous.

00:28:35.847 --> 00:28:39.017
They are very sensitive to spirituality.

00:28:39.017 --> 00:28:42.220
They won't accept anybody false,
somehow, I don't know what.

00:28:42.487 --> 00:28:46.458
And they asked me:
"Mother we believe that you are there.

00:28:46.658 --> 00:28:47.759
You are something.

00:28:47.759 --> 00:28:50.328
But how will you prove there is God?"

00:28:50.328 --> 00:28:52.230
I said, all right.

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:55.233
You put your hands and ask question:
"Is there God or not?"

00:28:56.901 --> 00:29:01.005
And they started feeling
the cool breeze in their hands

00:29:01.039 --> 00:29:03.475
and tremendous coolness.

00:29:03.475 --> 00:29:07.178
Then then said: "How are we to believe that
Christ was the Son of God?"

00:29:07.412 --> 00:29:10.682
All right.  Again, you put up your hands.

00:29:12.517 --> 00:29:16.387
Even if you have 10 small children
who are realized souls,

00:29:16.588 --> 00:29:19.591
and if you tie up their eyes

00:29:20.024 --> 00:29:22.360
and ask them:

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.562
"Now what's wrong with this gentleman?"

00:29:24.562 --> 00:29:26.331
They will all raise the same finger.

00:29:26.331 --> 00:29:29.334
Supposing they raise this finger or this finger.

00:29:30.235 --> 00:29:33.938
You ask:
"Have you got some heart trouble?"

00:29:33.938 --> 00:29:36.407
Immediately he'll say: "How do you know?"

00:29:36.407 --> 00:29:40.111
The diagnosis itself
will be done by little children of 10 years.

00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:42.280
It is fantastic! No doubt.

00:29:42.847 --> 00:29:46.384
It is too fantastic that people can believe.

00:29:47.552 --> 00:29:50.555
But you are fantastic!

00:29:51.856 --> 00:29:54.859
Supposing I take a little box,

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:59.664
in an Indian Village and show them that
this is called as television

00:30:00.198 --> 00:30:02.600
and you can see all kinds of films in it.

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.736
They'll say: "What, this box?"

00:30:04.736 --> 00:30:08.039
We also all think we are just boxes.

00:30:08.039 --> 00:30:11.776
But once you put to the mains
they will see how fantastic it is.

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:14.245
So I'm talking about

00:30:14.245 --> 00:30:17.248
something which is making a science.

00:30:17.949 --> 00:30:20.919
But the whole science is built in within us,
the whole knowledge

00:30:21.619 --> 00:30:25.156
and it starts manifesting
and you are amazed

00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:28.626
how you can do all these things.

00:30:30.128 --> 00:30:31.830
So the second thing is

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:34.833
that you know the absolute truth.

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:38.303
Now, what happens
when we know the absolute truth?

00:30:38.536 --> 00:30:41.706
We do not fall into any sects, into

00:30:41.706 --> 00:30:44.709
any kind of we can say..

00:30:48.379 --> 00:30:51.382
false type of enticements that we have.

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:56.521
Immediately we know this is false.

00:30:57.922 --> 00:31:00.925
But another great advantage is

00:31:01.926 --> 00:31:04.929
that when you know the absolute truth,

00:31:05.496 --> 00:31:08.466
there is no question of fighting

00:31:08.733 --> 00:31:11.736
because everybody sees the same truth,

00:31:12.704 --> 00:31:15.707
knows the same truth.

00:31:15.974 --> 00:31:18.610
I used to tell them about Freud

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:23.348
and they didn't like it very much at that
time, but now he's exposed.

00:31:23.948 --> 00:31:26.951
People have said psychoanalysis is no,

00:31:27.151 --> 00:31:29.387
[inaudible] no way to know.

00:31:29.387 --> 00:31:33.892
So now, when he is now exposed
they are agreeing to it.

00:31:33.958 --> 00:31:39.030
But so many would not sit in my program
because I said that Freud

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:42.100
has taken out some ion out of his head
and you have accepted it.

00:31:42.433 --> 00:31:45.203
There's no reality in it.

00:31:45.203 --> 00:31:49.140
So you know the reality
and all of you know the same reality.

00:31:49.307 --> 00:31:53.278
So there's no question of fighting,
no question arguing

00:31:53.278 --> 00:31:56.281
there are no dogmas,
there are no theories, nothing.

00:31:56.981 --> 00:32:00.451
Everybody sees the same point of view.

00:32:01.019 --> 00:32:04.022
So there will be no wars, there will be no quarrel,

00:32:04.455 --> 00:32:07.458
nothing of the kind.

00:32:10.395 --> 00:32:12.397
So this absolute truth

00:32:12.397 --> 00:32:15.733
is only known when you become the spirit.

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:18.069
That's a fact.

00:32:18.069 --> 00:32:21.072
Spirit is

00:32:21.072 --> 00:32:24.042
the Universal Being.

00:32:24.042 --> 00:32:28.880
Now, if spirit is the Universal Being,
you become a Universal Being.

00:32:29.948 --> 00:32:31.816
That means that

00:32:31.816 --> 00:32:34.819
you believe in all the religions,

00:32:34.852 --> 00:32:38.256
and you believe in all the prophets,
all the incarnations,

00:32:38.656 --> 00:32:41.659
and you see the essence

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:45.463
in every religion is the same,

00:32:46.064 --> 00:32:50.368
and the indication is that first
you become a realized soul.

00:32:50.668 --> 00:32:53.671
Christ has said you have to be born again.

00:32:54.739 --> 00:32:57.742
Everybody has said the same thing.

00:32:59.577 --> 00:33:03.314
But because of ignorance,
because of manipulation,

00:33:03.614 --> 00:33:06.617
we all fight in the name of God.

00:33:08.319 --> 00:33:11.055
When you become the Universal Being,

00:33:11.055 --> 00:33:12.857
you forget

00:33:13.291 --> 00:33:14.959
about races,

00:33:14.959 --> 00:33:17.962
about nations,

00:33:18.696 --> 00:33:21.199
false religions, false things

00:33:21.199 --> 00:33:24.202
and you all become

00:33:24.335 --> 00:33:27.338
absolutely congenial

00:33:28.006 --> 00:33:31.609
with each other and such a rapport is established

00:33:31.609 --> 00:33:35.313
between people.

00:33:35.313 --> 00:33:38.216
See now what is the difference we have

00:33:38.216 --> 00:33:40.118
between ourselves?

00:33:40.551 --> 00:33:45.757
You cut the skin a little bit and you'll
find the same nerve, the same muscle,

00:33:45.823 --> 00:33:48.659
the same bone in that part.

00:33:48.659 --> 00:33:51.095
Whether it is in England

00:33:51.095 --> 00:33:54.098
or it is in Australia, India or Russia.

00:33:54.098 --> 00:33:55.600
No difference.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.102
It's just skin deep.

00:33:58.102 --> 00:34:00.271
And you smile the same way,

00:34:00.271 --> 00:34:02.907
laugh the same way, cry the same way,

00:34:02.907 --> 00:34:05.877
feel the same.

00:34:06.611 --> 00:34:09.247
But still we are not conscious.

00:34:09.247 --> 00:34:11.449
This is not in awareness that we are

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:14.452
all universal beings.

00:34:14.619 --> 00:34:17.155
Now what is there to fight?

00:34:17.155 --> 00:34:20.558
In the name of these superficial skin deep things?

00:34:23.127 --> 00:34:28.032
So, what happens is this, that

00:34:29.033 --> 00:34:32.036
a kind of a great brotherhood

00:34:34.305 --> 00:34:36.908
starts emerging out.

00:34:36.908 --> 00:34:39.877
We have programs in India

00:34:40.078 --> 00:34:43.081
once a year, and about 3000 people come.

00:34:44.382 --> 00:34:47.385
At least 3000 people.

00:34:49.687 --> 00:34:52.657
They are from 55 countries.

00:34:53.357 --> 00:34:56.127
You'd be amazed, they are from 55 countries.

00:34:56.127 --> 00:34:57.995
I've never seen them quarreling,

00:34:57.995 --> 00:35:00.531
fighting with any violence.

00:35:00.531 --> 00:35:03.067
Even a football match,
you cannot see without a fight.

00:35:03.835 --> 00:35:07.538
Here, such love, such understanding.

00:35:07.538 --> 00:35:10.274
How they know each other,

00:35:10.274 --> 00:35:12.677
how they understand each other,

00:35:12.677 --> 00:35:16.914
how they love each other,
and how they intensely work

00:35:17.482 --> 00:35:21.185
for the benevolence of others
is very, very remarkable.

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:25.123
When I first went to Russia,

00:35:25.123 --> 00:35:30.495
You'd be amazed,
25 German Sahaja Yogis came in.

00:35:31.229 --> 00:35:34.398
And these 25 German Sahaja Yogis

00:35:35.133 --> 00:35:39.770
told me, when I asked them: "Why are you here?"

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:42.773
They said: "Mother, don't
you think it is our responsibility?"

00:35:42.907 --> 00:35:45.309
I said: "No, why?

00:35:45.309 --> 00:35:46.911
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:35:46.911 --> 00:35:49.547
Your forefathers might have
done something wrong."

00:35:49.547 --> 00:35:51.849
"No. It's our responsibility

00:35:51.849 --> 00:35:53.918
because they were our forefathers."

00:35:53.918 --> 00:35:55.786
And with great assiduity,

00:35:55.786 --> 00:35:58.990
even when I left and sure, they were there
and they worked it out.

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:02.627
And today, I must say,
spiritually, apart from India,

00:36:03.561 --> 00:36:06.564
Russia is the strongest country.

00:36:07.465 --> 00:36:09.967
People are so sensitive.

00:36:09.967 --> 00:36:12.970
I think we lost a lot of our energy

00:36:13.838 --> 00:36:16.841
in the choices

00:36:17.408 --> 00:36:20.411
and in the so-called freedom
and abandonment.

00:36:21.312 --> 00:36:24.448
While their government might have been
wrong.

00:36:24.715 --> 00:36:27.652
It might have been..
not so good.

00:36:28.085 --> 00:36:32.423
But, the people are extremely simple,

00:36:33.057 --> 00:36:35.693
and extremely loving,

00:36:35.693 --> 00:36:38.596
very affectionate.

00:36:38.596 --> 00:36:41.599
I was so surprised the way they were.

00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:48.005
Thousands and thousands who got
their realization.

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:54.545
Here, I am very much surprised at our mayor here,
that he has recognized me.

00:36:54.779 --> 00:37:00.818
The first time, I think any mayor
who has really recognized me in this way.

00:37:01.052 --> 00:37:04.956
And I'm really, must say
Cincinnati must be some special place where

00:37:04.956 --> 00:37:07.792
they have done it.
Of course, in Italy

00:37:07.792 --> 00:37:12.496
there are some mayors in small, small
villages with tremendous respect for me.

00:37:13.264 --> 00:37:15.566
But this kind of thing,

00:37:15.566 --> 00:37:20.838
proclamation is such a surprise
to me, shows that in this place, Cincinnati,

00:37:21.405 --> 00:37:23.874
there is an awareness

00:37:23.874 --> 00:37:26.744
that we need transformation.

00:37:26.744 --> 00:37:28.546
With transformation

00:37:28.546 --> 00:37:31.949
not only your physical, mental,
emotional problems are solved, but

00:37:32.116 --> 00:37:34.118
material problems are solved.

00:37:34.118 --> 00:37:37.121
Agriculture improves such a lot

00:37:37.521 --> 00:37:40.524
Because this vibrated

00:37:41.692 --> 00:37:45.596
things like water and all that,
when you give it

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:49.000
to the crops

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.936
we have seen, it has grown ten times.

00:37:51.936 --> 00:37:54.705
We have some doctors of agriculture

00:37:54.705 --> 00:37:57.708
who have experimented with it

00:37:57.708 --> 00:38:01.712
and have been trying to publish a book
about it.

00:38:01.712 --> 00:38:03.914
Not only agriculture,

00:38:03.914 --> 00:38:09.754
but so many other things, like,
we can say the ecological problem you have.

00:38:09.754 --> 00:38:12.757
It's the trees which are dying

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:15.793
with acid rain, have been saved.

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:20.164
And they are emitting very good air

00:38:20.164 --> 00:38:23.134
to counterbalance the ecological problem.

00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:26.070
So many things can be done

00:38:26.137 --> 00:38:28.406
once you have this force working in it.

00:38:28.406 --> 00:38:33.344
It is there. It's your own,
for which you don't have to pay.

00:38:33.577 --> 00:38:36.580
Just you have to have desire to have it.

00:38:38.616 --> 00:38:41.552
It's so simple as that.

00:38:41.819 --> 00:38:44.822
But I don't know why

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:48.592
one lady told me
in the plane, she was American,

00:38:48.592 --> 00:38:52.730
that: "We have had so many hoaxes
that Mother, maybe they don't believe you."

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:55.466
But no, I was the first to come here.

00:38:56.033 --> 00:38:58.903
But I was surprised
the way they said to me that:

00:38:58.903 --> 00:39:01.906
"We won't believe you
unless until you take money."

00:39:02.106 --> 00:39:05.109
So what's that?

00:39:05.176 --> 00:39:08.879
Another thing they said:

00:39:09.113 --> 00:39:11.148
"How can it be so easy?"

00:39:11.148 --> 00:39:16.454
But if it is so, supposedly,
I mean, I'm saying that just, to believe,

00:39:16.687 --> 00:39:21.025
there is a diamond kept here.
I say it's a real diamond.

00:39:21.359 --> 00:39:24.428
Won't you all rush to take it?

00:39:24.428 --> 00:39:28.032
But if I'm saying it is so easy,
on this point, they wouldn't accept.

00:39:28.232 --> 00:39:32.136
You shouldn't eat food like this but
should go around and eat like that.

00:39:32.136 --> 00:39:33.871
Otherwise, cannot.

00:39:33.871 --> 00:39:37.608
They believe you must suffer
before you get spirituality.

00:39:37.608 --> 00:39:40.311
I said you have suffered enough now,
believe me.

00:39:40.311 --> 00:39:42.346
You don't have to suffer.

00:39:42.346 --> 00:39:46.250
They think you have to go to Himalayas
and stand on your head,

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:51.288
and starve yourself on Gobi Desert,
and get Nirvana. In anyway you die.

00:39:51.288 --> 00:39:54.558
So you call it death is Nirvana.
You can do it.

00:39:54.692 --> 00:39:59.830
All these kind of ideas they gave me, I just,
I didn't want to talk to them.

00:40:00.097 --> 00:40:03.934
And all sorts of false people invaded.

00:40:04.201 --> 00:40:08.005
Not only Indians, Americans, Portuguese.

00:40:08.539 --> 00:40:11.976
All sorts of people invaded
and they succumbed to them.

00:40:13.444 --> 00:40:16.313
I didn't come to America for nine years
for the same reason.

00:40:16.313 --> 00:40:19.316
I thought know their ideas about truth are so funny,

00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:22.653
that you have to

00:40:22.653 --> 00:40:26.123
go to Himalayas and
you must do this and do that,

00:40:26.357 --> 00:40:28.959
that I will never be able to really work it out.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:35.966
After nine years, Sahaja Yogis told me:
"Now, mother, it's changing, you better come."

00:40:35.966 --> 00:40:39.970
So I came and
Cincinnati, I was here three years back.

00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:44.108
I am sorry, I should have come earlier,
but I've been very busy.

00:40:44.975 --> 00:40:47.144
South America is also very well

00:40:48.112 --> 00:40:51.015
in spirituality.

00:40:51.015 --> 00:40:54.018
They are very faithful, simple people.

00:40:54.018 --> 00:40:57.788
I don't say that complicated
people don't get realization.

00:40:57.788 --> 00:41:00.691
They do. All of them.

00:41:00.691 --> 00:41:04.862
But complicated people
have to devote little more time

00:41:04.862 --> 00:41:07.264
to get this connection alright.

00:41:07.264 --> 00:41:12.436
Like you see any complicated machinery.
If it goes out of order,

00:41:12.436 --> 00:41:15.306
you have to pay more attention to it.

00:41:15.306 --> 00:41:19.443
In the same way, once you get your realization,

00:41:19.677 --> 00:41:23.447
you have to come to the collective.

00:41:23.447 --> 00:41:28.786
Collective means that everybody is there
who knows all about Sahaja Yoga

00:41:28.786 --> 00:41:32.957
and you must master it.
That also is free.

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:34.725
Absolutely free.

00:41:34.725 --> 00:41:37.361
You don't have to pay for it.

00:41:37.361 --> 00:41:41.332
You should have all the knowledge
about the subtle system

00:41:42.066 --> 00:41:45.069
and you should get

00:41:46.136 --> 00:41:50.174
all the powers that are within you,
which can manifest.

00:41:50.474 --> 00:41:54.178
This is only my desire
and for which

00:41:54.478 --> 00:41:58.282
I am running day and night
all over the world.

00:41:59.149 --> 00:42:03.921
As they said, it's true that on one side,

00:42:04.455 --> 00:42:08.492
I have a very good family
and a very good husband.

00:42:08.726 --> 00:42:13.330
I have grandchildren.
And I myself, 70 years of age.

00:42:13.597 --> 00:42:18.602
So can you imagine, I'm still traveling
and doing all this work?

00:42:18.702 --> 00:42:23.173
Because even my family thinks that
it's very important

00:42:23.274 --> 00:42:26.310
that transformation must take place

00:42:26.544 --> 00:42:31.015
so that there's a complete emancipation
of human beings.

00:42:31.715 --> 00:42:36.420
And people should transform

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:40.224
to transform the whole world.
And this is a very special time.

00:42:40.691 --> 00:42:44.295
I hope people from Cincinnati
will respond to it

00:42:44.562 --> 00:42:48.365
and will get their self-realization.

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:53.003
We'll take about 10 to 15 minutes for that.

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:57.174
And..

00:43:00.811 --> 00:43:06.584
those, who do not want
to have their self-realization

00:43:07.351 --> 00:43:10.588
should leave the house,
should leave the place.

00:43:10.588 --> 00:43:13.290
Because I cannot force.

00:43:13.424 --> 00:43:17.394
It's your freedom
to get your realization.

00:43:17.962 --> 00:43:20.798
If you don't want it, you are free.

00:43:20.798 --> 00:43:24.268
If you want to enter into
the kingdom of God, you can.

00:43:24.468 --> 00:43:27.271
If you don't want, you cannot.

00:43:27.438 --> 00:43:32.376
Because, this is the work of divine love.

00:43:32.843 --> 00:43:36.080
Nothing can be forced.

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:39.049
And this compassion

00:43:39.049 --> 00:43:41.919
that is flowing

00:43:41.919 --> 00:43:44.588
as the divine love

00:43:44.588 --> 00:43:47.858
will not force anything on you.

00:43:47.958 --> 00:43:50.661
It respects your freedom.

00:43:50.694 --> 00:43:55.899
So I have to humbly request you,
those who do not want to have realization

00:43:56.133 --> 00:44:01.872
should leave the place
and should not, in any way,

00:44:02.906 --> 00:44:07.077
disturb others who want to have it.

00:44:19.223 --> 00:44:24.428
But definitely I would request you

00:44:25.896 --> 00:44:31.201
not to disturb when we are in the process
of our meditation

00:44:31.635 --> 00:44:35.939
which takes about ten minutes, only.

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:39.343
As I told you, it's a collective happening

00:44:40.044 --> 00:44:43.013
and you have to

00:44:44.081 --> 00:44:48.786
come to the collective
to work it out and to know about it.

00:44:50.554 --> 00:44:52.823
In that,

00:44:52.823 --> 00:44:56.827
you will be amazed how you will grow fast,

00:44:57.461 --> 00:45:02.399
and you will understand each and everything.

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:06.403
I'm sure you must be having

00:45:06.403 --> 00:45:11.141
lots of questions, also, in your mind.

00:45:11.975 --> 00:45:14.978
As I'm here only for one day,

00:45:15.045 --> 00:45:18.048
I would say
that you should write your questions

00:45:18.315 --> 00:45:20.851
and send them over,

00:45:20.851 --> 00:45:23.854
and I'll try to answer them.

00:45:24.621 --> 00:45:27.624
Tomorrow I am going away to Canada.

00:45:28.559 --> 00:45:31.662
And I'll be back again after one year.

00:45:31.662 --> 00:45:35.632
I promise I will be here
for a longer period next time.

00:45:47.711 --> 00:45:53.984
Now there are three conditions
which I must tell you,

00:45:54.151 --> 00:45:58.589
which are very simple.

00:45:59.623 --> 00:46:02.626
The first condition is

00:46:03.093 --> 00:46:08.532
that you have to be absolutely confident

00:46:08.999 --> 00:46:15.873
that you all are going to get
your self-realization tonight.

00:46:17.241 --> 00:46:20.711
Absolutely confident.

00:46:21.111 --> 00:46:24.114
Don't doubt yourself.

00:46:28.619 --> 00:46:32.122
So the second one follows

00:46:32.823 --> 00:46:39.663
that you should not
feel guilty at all at this moment, here.

00:46:44.201 --> 00:46:48.305
After all, you are human beings,
you are not gods.

00:46:49.306 --> 00:46:53.076
And human beings can only make mistakes,
isn't it?

00:46:53.744 --> 00:46:57.414
And this all pervading power
about which I am talking to you,

00:46:57.414 --> 00:47:00.417
which is going to work out
your self-realization,

00:47:00.818 --> 00:47:03.821
is the ocean of forgiveness.

00:47:04.121 --> 00:47:07.124
And very powerful ocean of forgiveness.

00:47:07.457 --> 00:47:11.295
And whatever mistakes
you might have committed,

00:47:12.362 --> 00:47:15.833
it can dissolve everything.

00:47:20.037 --> 00:47:23.040
So don't feel guilty at all.

00:47:23.073 --> 00:47:27.444
And this idea of being sinner
and all that, just forget it.

00:47:28.912 --> 00:47:32.149
If you are the seeker of truth,

00:47:32.149 --> 00:47:34.985
it's your right to get your

00:47:34.985 --> 00:47:36.987
your guide, your union with the divine.

00:47:36.987 --> 00:47:39.990
It's your right.

00:47:41.024 --> 00:47:44.895
"Sahaja" - "Saha" means with you is born,
"Ja" is born.

00:47:45.095 --> 00:47:48.332
This right to get this union.

00:47:49.299 --> 00:47:53.136
So please, don't feel guilty.

00:47:53.804 --> 00:47:57.007
I must tell you very frankly,
when you feel guilty,

00:47:57.274 --> 00:48:00.711
the center on the left side here, catches.

00:48:01.144 --> 00:48:03.981
As a result you might get spondylitis,

00:48:03.981 --> 00:48:06.984
you might get angina.

00:48:07.885 --> 00:48:10.687
Also, you are

00:48:10.687 --> 00:48:14.725
the system, the organs might become lethargic.

00:48:15.759 --> 00:48:19.196
So no use feeling guilty.
What's the use?

00:48:19.229 --> 00:48:20.931
If you have made mistakes

00:48:20.931 --> 00:48:23.600
You think you've made really mistake,
just face it and finish it off.

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:26.069
But don't carry it all here.

00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:29.840
But it has just become a fashion item.

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:33.744
One lady told me:
"I feel very guilty for Afghanistan."

00:48:34.011 --> 00:48:37.714
I said: "What, are you Afghani?" -No.
"Then, are you Russian?" -No.

00:48:37.848 --> 00:48:42.019
"Then why are you feeling?" -I'm just feeling.

00:48:44.721 --> 00:48:47.624
So please, in short,

00:48:47.891 --> 00:48:50.560
you have to be placed
very pleasantly towards yourself.

00:48:50.627 --> 00:48:53.630
Very very pleasantly.

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:03.173
Then..

00:49:04.741 --> 00:49:09.046
the third one is a very, very simple condition

00:49:10.247 --> 00:49:16.119
is that, you have to forgive
everyone without thinking about it.
