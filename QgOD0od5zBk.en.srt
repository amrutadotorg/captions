1
00:00:00,669 --> 00:00:05,480
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:23,721
That’s a very interesting subject that has
been given to Me to talk to you people because

3
00:00:23,721 --> 00:00:34,319
I have been always worried about the IAS,
IPS, and other Government servants, very much

4
00:00:34,319 --> 00:00:40,090
worried because I have known the kind of life
My husband was leading.

5
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:52,260
And I used to think: if these new people,
who have come to the services, to the Government

6
00:00:52,260 --> 00:01:02,029
service, we have to tell them the dangers
that are ahead of them.

7
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:07,400
Because we don’t know what is the subtle
system within us, which works.

8
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:16,049
And in the subtle system, when we lead this
kind of a very speedy, intensive life, it

9
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:17,289
has a defect.

10
00:01:17,289 --> 00:01:23,890
It has a defect you can see in the chart.

11
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:36,580
They have shown the, they have shown the subtle
system which works it out.

12
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:44,770
So we have a center here on the crossing of
the optic chiasma.

13
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:52,119
These, this center is very important because
we react with this.

14
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:55,409
We react to everything.

15
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:02,810
By this reaction we create a problem within
ourselves.

16
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:12,280
And this reaction comes to us because we do
not know how to go beyond the mind.

17
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,580
Every time we are looking at something, we
react.

18
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,200
We look at someone, we react.

19
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,720
But we cannot just watch.

20
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,640
We cannot be just the witness.

21
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,830
If we could be the witness, it will not have
any effect on us.

22
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,390
But we cannot be.

23
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,970
That’s the trouble when this center is very
active.

24
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:44,489
We call it as Agnya chakra, where the two
optic nerves meet.

25
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:50,680
At the crossing point, this center is placed.

26
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,690
Even Jung has said that, “You have to go
beyond your thoughts and that you have to

27
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,409
become thoughtlessly aware.”

28
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:04,930
Even in our Shastras is it written that, “You
have to have Nirvichar Samadhi,” is without

29
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,270
thought and the another is Nirvikalpa Samadhi.

30
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:15,090
Now even Einstein has said that, “You have
to go beyond the mind to reach the torsion

31
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,170
area,” he calls.

32
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:22,340
When he was searching for his Theory of Relativity,
he found it was difficult.

33
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,750
He couldn’t find it.

34
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,159
He got very tired.

35
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:29,799
He went into his garden and was playing with
soap bubbles like a child.

36
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:36,310
Then he says, “Suddenly from somewhere else
it dawned upon me this Theory of Relativity.”

37
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:44,480
He calls it openly as a torsion area and this
torsion area we have to touch instead of ourselves

38
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,640
thinking all the time and reacting.

39
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,110
Because as a result of that what happens we
should see.

40
00:03:52,110 --> 00:04:00,640
What happens is that our movement on the autonomous
nervous system goes to the right side.

41
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,390
The right side, it’s very good otherwise:
A person looks very impressive.

42
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,189
He can oppress other.

43
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:09,629
He can be aggressive.

44
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:12,099
He can be very systematic.

45
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:17,120
All these things can be there but it has a
reaction.

46
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:25,850
The reaction is horrible because this right
side affects our liver to begin with.

47
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:32,320
Now the liver is called ‘liver’ because
live, we live because of liver only.

48
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,990
That’s why it’s called ‘liver’.

49
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:41,820
This liver gets affected and there is no actually
treatment we should say in the medical science

50
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,820
for liver.

51
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,080
They can replace it with a pig’s liver or
some liver like that.

52
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,070
But otherwise, there is no way out.

53
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:55,360
But we are the ones we are spoiling this liver
ourself by creating tremendous heat in the

54
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,890
liver.

55
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:11,000
This special liver has got a capacity to absorb
heat and release heat into the blood stream

56
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,550
and then, you see, it gets relieved of it.

57
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:23,570
But when it is too much, when the liver is
too much full of heat then it cannot give

58
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,030
up that heat.

59
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:32,340
Then heat, this heat, heat starts traveling
upward.

60
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:37,740
It can go to the right lung.

61
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,610
It can go to the heart.

62
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:46,200
Now imagine, right lung means asthma.

63
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,480
Simple thing is asthma.

64
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,740
Then it goes to the heart.

65
00:05:52,740 --> 00:06:00,180
There’s a young boy, say of twenty one years
or so, up to that age.

66
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:06,160
He starts playing cricket, tennis, and drinks
a lot.

67
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,040
Then he gets a massive heart attack.

68
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,980
It’s fatal.

69
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,880
He cannot live.

70
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:20,220
Then it affects as I told you other organs
also.

71
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:33,140
This heat goes to the pancreas causing diabetes
of a very serious nature, not of a mild nature

72
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,120
but a very serious nature.

73
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,990
Then this heat passes down to the spleen.

74
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:45,540
In the spleen, it gives you blood cancer.

75
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:49,130
This is all possible for all right sided people,
I am telling you.

76
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:55,100
That’s why I was worried that people who
are, according to Me, are the spine of our

77
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,100
country.

78
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,320
They are the spine of our country.

79
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:10,100
They should not get out of life because of
too much of strain and stress on their mind.

80
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,020
Now then it goes to the kidneys.

81
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,570
It coagulates the kidneys and you get kidney
trouble.

82
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:21,030
You cannot pass urine and you have all the
troubles there.

83
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:27,870
Apart from that, it goes to the lower intestines
and you get terrible constipations and all

84
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:31,550
the problems of the constipation.

85
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:38,530
Then also to the heart at a later age it comes.

86
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,750
It goes on affecting.

87
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:46,310
Ultimately your heart fails very early in
age.

88
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:55,480
I know of, recently, two people died of heart
trouble who were at a very good position.

89
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:05,090
This is very much worrying Me that how to
bring them to close to themselves, to know

90
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:09,830
themselves what’s the problem is and how
to solve that problem.

91
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:19,970
With this we understand that we react, by
reaction we create such a heat within us.

92
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:27,680
Apart from this, the other psychosomatic diseases,
this is the, I am telling you about somatic,

93
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,919
but the psycho disease which comes from your
psychological problems come from the left

94
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,919
side.

95
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,469
Of course I’ll not deal with that now.

96
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:43,589
But somehow, if you can move from right to
the left, you are sure to get some psychosomatic

97
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:51,300
trouble which cannot be cured by medical science,
like cancer, aches, all kinds of this.

98
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,480
So you are just preparing your body for that.

99
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:02,339
In these modern times, the life is so full
of struggle, speed.

100
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:08,589
Now we were coming and there was a jam.

101
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,629
Now you can’t help it.

102
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:16,750
I was very silently watching, “Now this,
the jam, I have to reach late, doesn’t matter.”

103
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:21,260
My husband normally would’ve been really
in great trouble.

104
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,410
He would’ve looked at the watch all the
time.

105
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,519
Would have been “Where are we?

106
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,730
What are we doing?” this and that.

107
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:34,290
But he was so silently watching the whole
thing, I was amazed because normally he would

108
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:39,110
be jittering that we are getting so late for
a function like.

109
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:50,949
Now, you see, once you get rid of this problem,
is the easiest thing to live.

110
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:55,350
The other day I met one gentleman who was
transferred.

111
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,139
He said “Always whenever!”

112
00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:03,980
He is an IAS officer, “Whenever I am transferred,
Mother, I used to be so jittery.

113
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,709
Such tension, such stress on my mind, baba.

114
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:07,860
What will happen?

115
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,790
Where will the children go?

116
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,790
What will happen to the house?

117
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,500
This, that, all problems would come to me.

118
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,450
But what has happened to me and my wife, we
don’t feel anything now.

119
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,610
We don’t feel.

120
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,129
We are not worried.

121
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:23,629
We sleep very well.”

122
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:26,180
I said, “That’s what has to happen.

123
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,279
All these things should not affect you.”

124
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,920
That’s only possible when you can go beyond
this mind, which we think.

125
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:42,199
Mind is a, not such a good word, I should
say because it’s not mental.

126
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:50,009
It is, if it is only mind means the one which
thinks and for them mental hospital is also

127
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:51,009
mad people.

128
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:54,410
I don’t know how English language moves,
it’s difficult you know.

129
00:10:54,410 --> 00:11:01,759
English language is very difficult to explain
Sahaja Yoga because in the English language

130
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,730
you’ll be amazed that they call ‘spirit’.

131
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:14,490
‘Spirit’ is the Atma, right, ‘spirit’
is the dead body moving about according to

132
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:19,680
them and thirdly it means also alcohol.

133
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,730
Now which one is closer to which one, I don’t
know, but this is why I am saying that English

134
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,749
language is a difficult thing.

135
00:11:26,749 --> 00:11:33,540
Marathi is the best because lot of work has
been done among Maharashtrians on Kundalini.

136
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,949
Nath Panthis were there.

137
00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:37,720
They have done lot of work.

138
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:44,250
But the tradition was that one person would
give Realization to only one person.

139
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:52,850
If I have done anything you think worth mentioning,
it is that I tried to find out a way of giving

140
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,839
collective Realization, collective happening.

141
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:03,670
That’s what was My humble contribution and
by which I find thousands of people have got

142
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,160
their Realization.

143
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,870
Now what is the Realization?

144
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:15,389
It is that if you see at the base of the spinal
chord is a triangular bone called as ‘Sacrum’.

145
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:22,670
It is called ‘Sacrum’ because it is a
sacred bone and the Greeks knew about it,

146
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,589
that it’s a sacred bone.

147
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:32,459
And according to our Shastras and also many
other prophecies, there resides a power within

148
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:38,269
us, our own power, your own power called as
Kundalini.

149
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:44,050
Is called ‘Kundalini’ because it is in
three and a half coils.

150
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:48,910
Coils are called ‘kundal’, that’s why
it is the Kundalini.

151
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:53,870
Now this, this power is your own.

152
00:12:53,870 --> 00:13:04,009
It’s in every human being and if it is awakened,
it passes through six centers piercing through

153
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:11,430
the top of the head, which we call as the
Brahmarandhra in the Sanskrit language and

154
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,069
the fontanel area in the English language.

155
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:19,819
It passes through that soft bone which was
there in the childhood and you just start

156
00:13:19,819 --> 00:13:26,319
feeling the cool breeze coming out of your
head and the cool breeze coming on to your

157
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:27,319
fingertips.

158
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:28,319
It happens.

159
00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:32,470
It’s an experience and for which you cannot
pay.

160
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,470
You cannot.

161
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,889
I may go on telling you lots of stories this,
that, that won’t work out.

162
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:38,399
It has to happen.

163
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:44,779
The Kundalini has to rise and has to pierce
through fontanel area otherwise, otherwise,

164
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:46,720
it’s no use.

165
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,259
It’s just words, some sermon or something
like that.

166
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:58,619
So this happening is very easy in this Kaliyuga.

167
00:13:58,619 --> 00:14:04,899
Is really remarkable because maybe because
of Kaliyug people are fed up of the things

168
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:09,220
going on and all kinds of things working out.

169
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,160
Now what does it do?

170
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,079
It passes through six center.

171
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:24,999
Six centers, these are meant for our physical,
mental, and emotional being and also for our

172
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:26,220
spiritual being.

173
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:33,310
So when it passes through these six centers,
it nourishes those centers, it integrates

174
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:42,089
all these centers, and ultimately it passes
through this and enters into the all pervading

175
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:46,850
power of Divine love, is called as ‘Paramchaitanya’.

176
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:55,930
You may call it as ‘all pervading power
of Divine love’ or anything but names make

177
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:56,930
no difference.

178
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:04,680
There is a very subtle power around us, which
looks after us, which guides us, which helps

179
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,620
us, which is the torsion area.

180
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:17,510
Now, while doing that what happens that you
become knowledgeable of the absolute truth,

181
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,510
absolute!

182
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:25,309
Whatever you know is absolute, is nothing
to doubt, nothing can be challenged.

183
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:30,720
For example, it starts flowing through your
fingertips.

184
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,209
Starts flowing through your fingertips and
you can feel it on your fingertips, your centers.

185
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:41,209
Now these are five, six, and seven centers,
five, six and seven centers.

186
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:43,730
I am not going to tell you all the details
now.

187
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:55,089
But when you start feeling these whole sensation,
Adi Shankaracharya has called it as ‘spand’,

188
00:15:55,089 --> 00:16:01,309
then you feel the truth, the real truth.

189
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:08,369
For example, supposing in your office you
get somebody who is a cheat, very well dressed,

190
00:16:08,369 --> 00:16:12,619
speaks English very well, you know, very well
behaved.

191
00:16:12,619 --> 00:16:15,449
How will you make him out?

192
00:16:15,449 --> 00:16:19,450
Just have to put your hands under your table
and see for yourself.

193
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:26,720
Immediately you will get some sort of a burning
sensation or you might feel some sort of a,

194
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,759
what do you call, needle and pins like that.

195
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,939
That kind of a feeling you might get.

196
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:38,170
Then you will also know what centers he’s
catching on your fingertips.

197
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:42,079
This is the absolute knowledge about everything.

198
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:48,439
Is not question of only knowing he is a bad
or a good person, but also of diseases.

199
00:16:48,439 --> 00:16:53,810
Supposing you have some disease, you will
feel it on your fingertips.

200
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,769
On your fingertips you’ll feel it.

201
00:16:55,769 --> 00:17:00,990
You’ll know this is your disease and if
you know how to cure them, you can cure others

202
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:04,380
also because you become one with the whole.

203
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,540
It’s a very collective personality you develop.

204
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,000
Who is the other, after all?

205
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,640
We are all one.

206
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,160
But only trouble is we are separated because
of this ignorance.

207
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,920
Once this works out, so many things drop out
from us.

208
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:31,270
This is the right side I am telling you about
but also the conditionings are very much working

209
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,270
out in us.

210
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:36,010
In our reaction, there are two things that
work out.

211
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:39,281
One is the right side, another the left side.

212
00:17:39,281 --> 00:17:43,050
And the left side is all the conditioning
as you see there.

213
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:50,620
These conditionings come to us through our
childhood, through our family, through our

214
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:56,230
country, through our reading, this, that all
kinds of things, they come up.

215
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:06,940
But also family upbringing is very important
because according to our Shaastraas, there

216
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,940
are six enemies.

217
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,940
We have got six.

218
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,560
Now these six enemies are what?

219
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,530
So Kama, Krodha, Mada, Matsara, Lobha, Moha.

220
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:19,160
Kama is what you can call sexual urge.

221
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,670
Krodha is anger.

222
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:23,180
Krishna has denounced anger.

223
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:27,150
But all right sided people are hot tempered.

224
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,270
They don’t want to be, but they are.

225
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:33,390
And when they lose their temper then they
feel bad also.

226
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,750
Not that they want to lose it but they just
lose it.

227
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,700
Now this one drops out.

228
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:47,870
The temper goes out completely because you
develop that witness state saakshi swaroopa.

229
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:51,340
With that witness state you just see everything.

230
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,160
You don’t lose temper.

231
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,990
You just see it.

232
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,060
That is one thing drops out very well.

233
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:02,170
Mada is false pride.

234
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,170
That we have.

235
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,990
I know IAS officers and their wives.

236
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,830
They have that false pride.

237
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:12,360
Not everyone, but some of them do, they have.

238
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,000
I have very funny experiences of that.

239
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,780
Like, once we went to Delhi to Hatriji and
they had given us a house in Mina Bagh and

240
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:25,800
I met another friend of Mine from Lucknow
who had married an IAS officer.

241
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,540
Oh, very proud girl and she asked Me, “Where
are you living?

242
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,540
How are you?”

243
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,800
I said, “My husband is a government servant
and so he’s transferred here.”

244
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,040
“But where are you living?”

245
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,280
I said “Mina Bagh.”

246
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,280
“Oh my God!

247
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,280
Mina Bagh!

248
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,280
What is your husband doing?

249
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,280
Is he a clerk?

250
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,280
What is he doing?”

251
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,880
I said, “He’s doing something” and I
was just looking at her the way she was on

252
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,880
Me.

253
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,190
“My husband might be your husband’s boss”
this and that.

254
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,020
I said, “Maybe I don’t know anything about
these things.

255
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,990
I am sorry, I don’t know your list of people,
anything.

256
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,770
I am not interested.”

257
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:02,150
And then My husband came.

258
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,930
So she said, “See that tall man.

259
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,430
You know he’s very important.

260
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,320
He’s with the Prime Minister.

261
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,570
You go and talk to him and get Your husband
promoted.”

262
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:23,900
I said ([Laughing] What is she up to?), I
said, “Sudhali, he is My husband.”

263
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,900
“Heh!

264
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,540
He’s your husband?

265
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,540
Haan yaar!

266
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,940
Oh my God!

267
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,870
I am sorry I am.”

268
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,040
I said, “It’s all right.”

269
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,040
Common experience.

270
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:42,620
The women also become IAS, you see, not actually
but as wives and I’ve been such a lost person

271
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,680
with them.

272
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:50,860
I could never understand what is there to
be IAS and to be his wife.

273
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,660
It was beyond Me.

274
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:59,200
But one thing, what really helped Me in all
this turmoil of life, because you know our

275
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:09,880
pay is less, this, that all problems are there,
was the patriotism Raashtra Bhakti.

276
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,940
My father was a great patriot.

277
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,100
My mother was.

278
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:18,090
They sacrificed everything for the independence
of this country.

279
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:23,520
I cannot travel by any foreign airlines, whatever
maybe.

280
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,220
Maybe Air India is not good, doesn’t matter.

281
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,550
It’s My, My country’s.

282
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:35,480
So the feeling that this is My country kept
Me going.

283
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,410
You see you become like a Kargil soldier.

284
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:42,390
You are fighting for your country.

285
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:47,320
You are working for your country.

286
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,580
My husband got into Indian Foreign Service.

287
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,920
I told him, “Nothing doing.

288
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:56,610
We don’t drink, both of us and I can’t
leave My country in the lurch at the time

289
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,650
when we have got the freedom.

290
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,100
So if you want you can go, I will not come.

291
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,260
I don’t want to go to Foreign Service.”

292
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,700
They cut his pay.

293
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,510
That time, you know, 300 was a big amount.

294
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,130
I said, “Doesn’t matter.

295
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:11,150
Whatever it is, I’ll stay in My country.

296
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,640
I’ll work in My country and you work here.

297
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,150
I’ll support you every way.

298
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,830
I don’t want anything.

299
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:25,740
Nothing I want and you don’t take a bribe
at all otherwise that day I’ll leave this.”

300
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:33,650
Otherwise also I said that, “The another
thing is our country has to develop.”

301
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,660
Who will develop?

302
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:41,210
I always felt that you are the spinal cord
of our country.

303
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,420
You have to develop this country.

304
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,420
What is this money?

305
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,420
Comes and goes.

306
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:50,800
You’ve seen the people who have got money,
where their children have gone?

307
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,360
What has happened to them?

308
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,360
What have they achieved?

309
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:59,080
So I told very frankly that I will not go
to the Foreign Service of any kind because

310
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,720
what is in the Foreign Service?

311
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,760
I want to do everything in this country of
Mine for which I have also fought.

312
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:14,150
I have fought a lot and this is what now sometimes,
you know, is disappointing to see what things

313
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,240
are happening.

314
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,600
But a day will come.

315
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,390
This country will rise.

316
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:19,390
How?

317
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:24,950
Because when this happens, when this Kundalini
rising take place, when people become realized

318
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:27,470
souls, they just transform.

319
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:35,040
They become extremely patriotic, extremely
patriotic and they understand what is needed

320
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,340
today for our country.

321
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,280
They can sacrifice anything.

322
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:48,240
They can live anywhere and they are not bothered
about some sort of a, you can call it a financial

323
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,070
help or other material thing.

324
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,330
They are above materialism.

325
00:23:53,330 --> 00:24:01,250
There are thousands and thousands like that
even in our country, thousands and also abroad.

326
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:04,080
Now Sahaja Yoga is working 86 countries.

327
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:13,210
They are all full of joy because with this
happening you get joy of a quality which has

328
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,210
no double thing.

329
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:15,490
It’s not happiness / unhappiness.

330
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:22,720
It’s just joy and you have another thing
also with it, is the peace of mind.

331
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,040
Just you are so peaceful, absolutely peaceful.

332
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,580
You don’t have to worry about things.

333
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:37,730
You don’t have to become jittery because
see the diseases you develop.

334
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:42,050
Apart from that, all kinds of paralysis comes
on us.

335
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:47,420
We had a doctor in our hospital there who
was working very hard.

336
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:51,050
I told him that, “Doctor, see now your age
has come.

337
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,560
You should take it easy.

338
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,120
Daytime you must rest.

339
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,290
There’s no need.

340
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:59,340
You are not in a office, just rest, take rest
do something else.

341
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,770
Read or you can go and play.

342
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:02,770
Do something.”

343
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:09,100
He wouldn’t listen to Me and then he got
paraplegia, means that failure of the hand

344
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,730
and the leg, completely.

345
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:12,000
He couldn’t even walk.

346
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,150
He couldn’t lift his leg.

347
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:16,310
Now he’s all right, cured.

348
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:20,310
But then I told him that you take treatment
for your right side.

349
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,090
That’s very important.

350
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:27,710
It’s very simple treatment and which can
be done very easily.

351
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:32,050
For example, you can have an ice bag on the
liver.

352
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:35,800
You can have ice bag here because this is
the portion.

353
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,910
This moves like this so the portion this one
gets heated up.

354
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:44,030
So you put ice here, you put ice.

355
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:47,890
This icing business will really help you a
lot.

356
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:55,040
But also there are some other very simple
homely treatments which you can take.

357
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,460
But I would request all of you to come to
our center somewhere in

358
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,290
Mother talks aside: [Bhaaratiya?

359
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,660
Wahan hai na?

360
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,950
Bharatiya, usmein hai ki nahi?]

361
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,740
Where is she gone?

362
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,910
Somebody says, “Bhaaratiya Vidya Peeth.”

363
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:15,060
Shri Mataji: So you all can come there if
you live in this area.

364
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,870
In every area, we have got centers.

365
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:21,020
So you all can come into that center humbly.

366
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:28,330
There is, you see, in Sahaja Yoga there is
nothing like any position or anything.

367
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,980
We have to humble down.

368
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,920
This false pride is of no use.

369
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,090
We humble down.

370
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:41,210
When we humble down, it’s very easy to achieve
it and to get this into yourself.

371
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,520
After all, otherwise, what is it?

372
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,030
What is life for?

373
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,750
There’s no enjoyment.

374
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:52,020
There’s no experiencing of what you are
doing.

375
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,070
So much work you put in I know, I know that.

376
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:58,370
I know how you people have to work hard.

377
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:06,230
But to get over, to get over all the strain
and stress, you must do meditation for five

378
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:08,420
minutes which they will tell you how to do
it.

379
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,840
Five minutes in the evening will help you.

380
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:19,420
So, just like as you take bath in the morning,
bathe yourself with the showers of this Kundalini.

381
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,690
She’s your mother.

382
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:29,462
She has been your mother from ages and she
has recorded everything about you within itself.

383
00:27:29,462 --> 00:27:35,270
This is the subtle side of you and when you
want to have your Realization, she’s very

384
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,490
anxious to be awakened.

385
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:41,100
She’s extremely anxious and it works wonders.

386
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:46,480
I am surprised that how people get Realization
in no time.

387
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:52,000
The only trouble with them is, it’s like
a primule or you can call it the ‘ankuraa’,

388
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,250
which grows but it doesn’t become a tree.

389
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:58,330
So, little bit you have to meditate.

390
00:27:58,330 --> 00:27:59,330
You have to be collective and works out.

391
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:04,640
In collective, you forget everything, your
position everything.

392
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:10,890
I have known IAS officers who have been dancing
with the villagers, singing with the villagers,

393
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,080
so much they enjoy.

394
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,930
They said, “We knew this but we never wanted
to express it, you see.”

395
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,550
So all this drops out.

396
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:23,590
All these outward bondages drop out and you
become one with the collective.

397
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,870
You know their problems.

398
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:28,790
You know how to solve them and it’s very
good.

399
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:33,980
I think this is what is only one has to achieve,
nothing else.

400
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:38,300
If you achieve this, you’ve achieved the
last and the best.

401
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,620
With this then you can help others.

402
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,880
You can give Realizations to others.

403
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,110
You can save their lives.

404
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:48,840
I mean, it’s all your power that is going
to work out.

405
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:58,170
In these days of horrible struggle and all
kinds of things happening, violence, very

406
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:01,780
much needed is this Sahaja Yoga.

407
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:07,690
And you’ll be amazed, it is something a
grace that people get it.

408
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:12,780
In Turkey, we have about two thousand people
who are realized souls.

409
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:20,640
Nobody lost their life, not a single thing,
not their houses were even, they just little

410
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:26,060
bit, I would say, shook but never fell down.

411
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,400
The whole Orissa, it happened the same.

412
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:36,410
It has happened in several places that people
have been just saved with those who have been

413
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:39,350
in the grace of the Divine.

414
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,750
We have to become that.

415
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,810
We can’t live without it.

416
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,040
It’s rather subtle.

417
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:50,180
It is subtle, I know but sometimes must understand
we have to be subtle.

418
00:29:50,180 --> 00:30:00,660
Now as it is, so much of illness, sickness
I find, mostly I find with all the people

419
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:03,960
who are working very hard is the right sided
problem.

420
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,250
Some sort of a right side.

421
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:13,730
And it can be absolutely cured, absolutely
be under your control, and you can cure others

422
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:14,730
also.

423
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:20,870
This is such a blessing we have in this horrible
Kaliyuga.

424
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:27,010
The worst times, they say, the worst and worst
that is the time is now and you see the effects

425
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,010
of that.

426
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:31,820
But in that only, the lotus of Sahaja Yoga
has come up.

427
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,240
You don’t have to pay for it.

428
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,280
That’s one thing you should know.

429
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,190
Anybody asks money from you, he’s not Divine.

430
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,610
Don’t have to pay for it, at all.

431
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:49,370
When you grow and when you achieve, when you
give Realizations to others, then you will

432
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:55,590
be surprised you rise into a new realm of
understanding which is a doubtless awareness

433
00:30:55,590 --> 00:31:01,670
which is called as ‘Nirvikalpa Samadhi’
according to Patanjali.

434
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:07,330
Now as we have learnt English, I don’t think
we read much of the, our Indian scriptures

435
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,640
and thing.

436
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:17,190
But that also, those who read will go on praying
to one monde of statues, this, that, I mean

437
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:24,590
just they are fanatically religious people,
wasting their life like that.

438
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:29,840
The another side are the buddhivaadis what
you call are the intellectuals, you see.

439
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,010
They are the much worst because they think
they have read everything.

440
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:34,010
They know everything.

441
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,010
Now what to tell them?

442
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,730
It’s a very simple thing, they don’t want
to accept.

443
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:40,480
You can’t tell them, “Take it straight.”

444
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,680
You have to have it in the other way.

445
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:51,920
So also to understand it, we should know we
have not known ourselves.

446
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:56,880
We have to know ourselves and for knowing
ourselves, Kundalini awakening is the only

447
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,700
way, as far as I know.

448
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:07,841
And I hope you all will think about it and
come to our centers where Realization can

449
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:08,841
be given.

450
00:32:08,841 --> 00:32:11,150
There are many centers we have got.

451
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:16,850
You don’t have to pay any money, nothing,
but you come and relax.

452
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:20,910
Relaxation is only possible after Self-Realization,
not before that.

453
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:24,850
You’ll be surprised your aging will stop.

454
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,680
I have no aging problem.

455
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,590
My husband also has no aging problem.

456
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,490
We don’t think of it.

457
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:32,490
It’s over.

458
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:35,690
Now, whenever one has to die, one will die.

459
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:39,900
But till then we are not bothered.

460
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:45,670
Anything that you do will have a special light
of the Divine.

461
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:51,880
I bless you from My heart that you develop
this subtle things within yourself and you

462
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,410
try to understand that so far you have not
known yourself.

463
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:57,740
You have to know yourself.

464
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:02,430
You don’t have to introspect and sit down
criticizing yourself, feeling guilty.

465
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,830
No, not at all.

466
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:08,810
Whatever has happened has happened because
you’ll be amazed at yourself that all your

467
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:12,500
destructive habits also will drop out by themselves.

468
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:18,160
Overnight in London, there were twelve boys
with the addiction of drugs.

469
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:22,610
They stopped over night, over night.

470
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,050
I don’t, never told them.

471
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:26,070
I never tell people, “Don’t, don’t.”

472
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,600
I never say that.

473
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:36,010
But that Kundalini rises and the light of
the, your heart, light of the Spirit, that

474
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,400
guides you.

475
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,990
That tells you what is destructive for you.

476
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:45,150
And you have power not to accept anything
that is destructive.

477
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,030
I know there are difficulties.

478
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:50,870
I know there are problems but you’ll never
see them.

479
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:55,590
If you are sitting in a boat, you are not
be bothered as to how deep the sea is.

480
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,810
It’s like that.

481
00:33:56,810 --> 00:34:02,030
You rise above all these things and you watch
and you help others.

482
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:05,720
Apart from that, it helps you in your work,
very much in your work.

483
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:10,750
You understand your work very well because
of torsion area again.

484
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,909
My husband says, “How do You get this idea?”

485
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:15,069
I say, “I got it.

486
00:34:15,069 --> 00:34:18,940
All right this is the idea, I’ve got it.”

487
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,819
Now he’s amazed sometimes how I manage things.

488
00:34:21,819 --> 00:34:22,819
How I am doing?

489
00:34:22,819 --> 00:34:24,159
I have no secretariat.

490
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,749
I have no secretary.

491
00:34:25,749 --> 00:34:28,220
I have no P.A., nothing.

492
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,009
And we are working in 86 countries.

493
00:34:31,009 --> 00:34:38,740
So it is just works out because it is this
Divine power which is so helpful or which

494
00:34:38,740 --> 00:35:51,950
is so kind.

495
00:35:51,950 --> 00:36:40,849
So again and again, I wish you best of luck.

496
00:36:40,849 --> 00:37:40,680
Please come to our centers.

497
00:37:40,680 --> 00:39:02,740
I hope they’ll give you the addresses and
all that and you 

498
00:39:02,740 --> 00:40:05,599
can come on Saturdays or Sundays, whenever
you 

499
00:40:05,599 --> 00:41:41,640
want to and 

500
00:41:41,640 --> 00:42:20,150
get 

501
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:25,140
your Realization.

502
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:43,930
May God bless you!

503
00:42:43,930 --> 00:43:50,609
Somebody says, “Shri Mataji, they 

504
00:43:50,609 --> 00:47:32,289
are requesting, if 

505
00:47:32,289 --> 01:04:20,490
you can give them Self Realization here?”
