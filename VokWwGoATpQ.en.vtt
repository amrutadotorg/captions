00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:10.639
Today we are going to have a short session,
because you are all invited today to a dinner

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.440
after the programme.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:29.920
The host is my husband who wants to invite
you and he’ll be coming about 8:15 or 8:30.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:44.370
So, today we are going to think about our
Spirit, which we have neglected throughout.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:52.940
We are not even conscious that we have a Spirit.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:03.760
Through Sahaj Yoga those who are now conscious,
because they can feel it through their vibrations,

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:11.520
they can also get lost and can forget it.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:25.230
The Spirit is the only eternal thing within
us, all the rest are transitory and evolutionary.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:34.380
Everything goes into evolution and the better
is the evolution, the higher the Spirit starts

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.150
manifesting itself.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:50.940
Like the reflection on the stone of even the
sun is zero.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:02:05.200
And the reflection of the sun on the lake
is sometimes I think, is a reflection that

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:15.920
is felt in the Sahaj Yogis, when they see
it, feel it, it flows, they can feel the breeze

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.240
in their hand.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:33.060
But still their attention is not fully enlightened.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.280
The Spirit has not permeated inside.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.800
It’s just reflecting still.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:54.180
In the mirror you see the reflection of the
sun.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:03.470
But even then, when you remove it you cannot
reflect it.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:19.430
This is the difference – that even if you
become the mirror of the sun, unless and until

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:27.569
it permeates into your being and transforms
you into something new, you have not done

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.580
full justice to yourself and nor to the powers
of your Spirit.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:43.650
The Spirit has come just like a vision to
you, an experience to you, but the growth

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.410
of your being has not yet started.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.390
And if it has started it’s so slow that
you may not achieve much in one lifetime.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:58.170
Because your attention is on all various things.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.620
You have been misidentified from the very
beginning.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.640
Since the time you were amoeba you have been
misidentified.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.120
The matter played a big role in your life,
so matter was important.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.690
Then all the five elements that are within
us were very important to us.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.169
Because we can see them, feel them, we have
lived them for years, thousands and thousands

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.949
of years.

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:31.809
So they are part and parcel of your being
and that is why you are so much identified

00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:32.809
with it.

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:34.710
Naturally, no doubt.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.280
But in the living process it never happens
like that.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:52.070
There are some seeds which grow so fast that
within one year they become trees after they

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.990
have been sprouted.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.240
They bear fruit in one year’s time.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:09.540
Some trees are such, but some of them linger
on and linger on and linger on and they take

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:18.439
too much time, so much so that maybe when
they are not yet fully developed any storm,

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:25.969
any wind, any one of these things can just
push them down.

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:28.169
So you have to make a rapid growth within.

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:41.180
Even after realisation I have seen people
do not pay attention to their Spirit.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.099
So for every Sahaj Yogi today I would say
they have to ask, “Where is your attention,

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:47.099
Mr?”

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:48.099
Or Mrs.

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:50.619
or Miss, whatever it is.

00:05:50.619 --> 00:05:55.099
“Where is your attention?”

00:05:55.099 --> 00:06:05.229
For example we can be enveloped with problem-solving
something absolutely useless.

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:09.819
Specially in the West we do it much more than
in the East because we take it for granted

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:12.029
in the East, many things.

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:18.979
But here because we think by planning we have
achieved a lot, we start planning.

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:26.379
We start planning about going to a place,
and buying a ticket, and doing this and doing

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:28.169
that; everything is too planned out.

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:36.960
All the time we are wasting on something which
does not require any time at all.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.490
Supposing you have to go somewhere, alright.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:47.809
First of all I don’t know if going is that
important, but to some people that is much

00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:48.809
more important.

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:54.090
Like one gentleman today came with his family
to see me, specially to meet me, according

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.090
to him!

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.089
I don’t know how far to believe.

00:06:57.089 --> 00:07:00.120
So he wanted to have a special interview with
me in my house.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.720
He had it and that’s how I am late.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.770
He doesn’t mind that.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:11.399
Then now he cannot come to the programme because
he has got some friends whom he has to meet.

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:17.030
His wife has not got Realisation, does not
matter [to him].

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:21.599
Because his friends are very loving people,
very good, they have been very kind to him,

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:23.259
he must meet them.

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:27.379
Where is the attention?

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:35.629
All these misidentifications we have, like
marriage also.

00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:40.120
Some people come to me and tell me, “Mother,
we are very happily married,” or unhappily

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.120
married.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.740
Or the one who is happily married is equally
a headache as the unhappily married.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:50.300
The unhappily one you can understand why he’s
a headache.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.259
But the happily married also says, “I must
do something for wife.

00:07:53.259 --> 00:07:54.349
I have not done anything.

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:56.039
I haven’t bought her a diamond ring.

00:07:56.039 --> 00:07:57.360
I must buy for her."

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.099
“I haven’t done this thing for her, I
must get her a Rolls-Royce, and do all this

00:08:00.099 --> 00:08:01.099
and that."

00:08:01.099 --> 00:08:03.220
But where is your attention?

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:23.330
The whole attention is diverted to things,
which has no play, which has no meaning, which

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.710
helps you nowhere.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:33.550
Then the attention is, in a subtler way, in
many other things, like children.

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:41.360
Now children, if I say anything they’ll
say, “Mother, do you want us to neglect

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.360
the children?”

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.840
This is the problem.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.830
Children are not looked after by you, they
are looked after by God.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:51.740
You are just a instrument of God to look after
them.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.990
The more you are with God, the better you
are with your children, you know how to handle

00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:01.640
them, you are kinder to them, you know how
to solve their problems much better if you

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.380
are getting your power from God.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:12.501
But if you are not interested in God, He is
not either interested in you.

00:09:12.501 --> 00:09:16.830
That’s the thing we do not understand.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:25.260
We think that if we are interested in God,
we are obliging Him.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:38.660
Supposing you are interested in a job you
never think that way that you are obliging

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.080
the job.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:47.340
But as far as the God is concerned we think
“Why?

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:56.080
We are obliging God!”

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.400
You are not obliging God at all, He is obliging
you.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:04.690
The attitude is so funny among human beings
that you can’t imagine!

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:15.200
All the time they feel they are obliging God
and they are doing something for the God.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.010
What can you do for Him?

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:20.500
Just think like that.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:25.540
I met a lady, she said: “Oh, how did I get
cancer?

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:26.540
I don’t understand.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.430
I used to always pray to God."

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:35.321
According to her, if she prayed to God, she
thinks she’s paid Him the money for His

00:10:35.321 --> 00:10:39.630
job and He better look after her!

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:45.650
It is you who are obliged by His kindness,
by His compassion.

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:50.570
He is so gracious that He knows that you are
stupid.

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.760
He knows that you don’t know this.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.270
He forgives you for your stupidity.

00:10:56.270 --> 00:11:07.900
He knows that you are naive and that you are
children, that you are small, still not grown,

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.200
you are not matured enough.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.180
If you are egoistical, He forgives you.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.650
Because He’s compassionate.

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.490
But do not take it for granted!

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:23.480
Do not take it for granted!

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:35.500
Those who think that, “We can do whatever
we like and behave in whatever way we like,

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:39.300
as long as we pray to God.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:43.260
Yes, He’ll do everything for us."

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.240
Why should He?

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.880
Where is our attention?

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.860
What is yoga?

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:53.602
In simple words, it is taking your attention
to the Spirit.

00:11:53.602 --> 00:11:57.680
This is yoga.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:03.670
What does the Kundalini do?

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:08.210
She raises your attention and takes it to
the Spirit.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:13.980
Only after knowing the Spirit you can know
God, not before that.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:19.560
That’s why all religions have failed.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:29.930
The incarnations who came to propound these
religions said that again and again.

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:32.130
For example Christ said that you are to be
born again.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:38.120
Alright, if you have to be born again, what
did we do?

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.050
“We got some people, certified that they
can give you rebirth."

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:49.370
So they will have some water very nicely put
in a very beautiful place in the church and

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:54.110
you very solemnly walk down, and they put
some water on your head and they said, “You

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:55.900
are now reborn!”

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.829
And you accept it!

00:12:58.829 --> 00:12:59.829
You just accept it!

00:12:59.829 --> 00:13:06.130
As a child – because you know I was born
in a Christian family – I used to laugh,

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:07.990
I used to say, “What’s this mockery going
on?”

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:13.750
I thought they are just playing like children,
though I was a child, but I used to think

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.350
they are really playing.

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:18.130
I didn’t know they were seriously doing
it!

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.130
(laughter).

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:21.180
Really, I did not know, till quite some time.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:25.390
When I grew up I was surprised, they are serious
about it!

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:30.980
I mean, they believed in it, they believed
they were getting rebirth and “It’s baptism,

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.760
that’s the way it should be."

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.000
I really felt it.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.680
I was amazed!

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:43.120
And how people were satisfied with that was
a greater amazement to me!

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:50.200
They would not ask, they would not challenge,
they would not say anything about it; whether,

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.930
“Am I really realised or not?

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:54.750
Am I really reborn?”

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:57.390
In the same way among Hindus, they do the
same nonsense.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:59.110
Same thing they do.

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:01.540
When the child is about eight years of age,
or say, from five years to eight years they

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.590
call it as a ‘Yajnopavit samskara’.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:11.130
(sacred thread ceremony) That is the day they
have to invite lots of people for dinner as

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:15.130
we have – you see, everything must have
a dinner with it!

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:19.400
The attention is more there (on food)!

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:24.180
And then they have a big function and then
they have a big puja, this that.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:30.000
And the Brahmins, who are not connected with
God, are doing all the puja and worshipping

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.750
and everything and God is nowhere there!

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:41.050
And then the fellow gets a thread which is
to certify that he’s a Brahmin, from a person

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:44.480
who has certified himself that he’s a Brahmin!

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.310
It’s all self-certification and falsehood!

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:50.711
For a person like me it was amazing!

00:14:50.711 --> 00:14:58.230
And I used to wonder, “What’s the matter
with these people?”

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.410
How have they taken all these things into
their hands?

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:04.290
Why don’t they question themselves once
for all?

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:10.260
“How we are doing?”

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:18.260
Not only [that] but I found them to be completely
mesmerised with the idea that they are doing

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.910
the right thing.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:26.050
Every Monday I hear the people singing next
to my house.

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:27.180
What are they singing?

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:28.290
God alone knows!

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:34.150
They come, very well organised, just to sing
some sort of hymns and things like that, which

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:37.890
has no meaning, which is not going to reach
to God.

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:39.410
Where is their attention?

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:45.240
The attention has to be on the Spirit and
that cannot be there unless and until something

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:49.120
happens within you.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:56.570
But those who have been seeking that attention,
those who have been asking that, “Oh Lord,

00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:07.800
keep my attention on God and on seeking,”
are, the people, going to be blessed; not

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:13.380
the people who have their attention [elsewhere]:
now supposing in the morning they go to the

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:17.450
church and next day to the races, and third
day somewhere else.

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:21.780
Again on a Sunday morning they are there back
in the church, regularly.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:25.860
And they say, “I regularly go to the church!”

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:36.360
The attention has to be on the Spirit, even
before and after Realisation.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:42.819
Many people ask us, “Mother, then what should
people do before Realisation?”

00:16:42.819 --> 00:16:50.260
They should put their attention on their Spirit,
asking for it, that, “Take my attention,

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.350
Oh my Lord, to my Spirit."

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:57.930
And not to accept something which is false
and nonsensical.

00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:03.390
Because once you start accepting something
false it sits on your head.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:11.130
It’s a vicious circle: you have to go ahead
with it and you don’t know where you are

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:17.260
and by the time you realise, you find you
are too old to give it up and you carry on,

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.260
somehow.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.959
It’s like intoxication.

00:17:19.959 --> 00:17:24.209
All falsehood of the world is an intoxication!

00:17:24.209 --> 00:17:30.269
Because if it was not intoxicating or hypnotising,
why people carry on with it?

00:17:30.269 --> 00:17:36.919
I mean, to me, I don’t understand: when
you know it is falsehood, why should you carry

00:17:36.919 --> 00:17:37.919
on with it?

00:17:37.919 --> 00:17:39.759
Of course, you can play with it.

00:17:39.759 --> 00:17:42.240
That’s a different thing, just to play.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.440
Just like children: they build everything.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:49.160
If you tell “Put them on the sand,” they’ll
build a big castle and they’ll make a house

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.690
and they’ll make a cowshed and everything.

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:57.900
And [afterwards] just they break everything,
take it out, clear out the whole thing.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.549
They know it’s just a play they have done
it.

00:17:59.549 --> 00:18:01.879
They are conscious of it.

00:18:01.879 --> 00:18:09.940
If this consciousness is there, then one should
say that such people are seekers.

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:15.750
That is the category of seekers, where they
are not satisfied with falsehood and they

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:17.899
want to find out the Truth.

00:18:17.899 --> 00:18:24.289
Now the Truth is that the Spirit is within
you and you are the Spirit.

00:18:24.289 --> 00:18:29.659
You are the beauty, the bliss and the joy
of that Spirit.

00:18:29.659 --> 00:18:31.330
That’s what you are.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:39.320
Because your attention is not there that’s
why you cannot feel your Spirit.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:48.070
But your Spirit exists, it is within you,
in your heart, waiting for a moment to come

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:55.249
into your conscious mind, to be felt by you
in your central nervous system.

00:18:55.249 --> 00:19:01.119
It’s all there, built within you.

00:19:01.119 --> 00:19:11.590
Man in his madness doesn’t realise that
God has made him from amoeba to this stage

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:12.659
for some purpose.

00:19:12.659 --> 00:19:22.340
There is a big purpose behind everything,
and the purpose is that now you have to know

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:28.429
your Spirit by which you enter into the Kingdom
of God.

00:19:28.429 --> 00:19:31.000
You have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000
How?

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.350
What is your passport?

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:37.480
Is your Spirit.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:44.880
Because when the Spirit starts shining within
you, you start transforming.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:55.820
You start transforming into a new being, into
a new personality with a new awareness and

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:59.749
you are a different person.

00:19:59.749 --> 00:20:01.570
Your priorities change.

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:12.159
But those who are not really good seekers
I would say, may have a three-legged race,

00:20:12.159 --> 00:20:14.240
as I call that.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.739
They’ll be identified with something else.

00:20:16.739 --> 00:20:17.940
What is a three-legged race?

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:21.400
Is that you are tied with one leg to another
personality.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:28.239
Now this could be the job, this could be anything
else, and you are tied with it and the progress

00:20:28.239 --> 00:20:31.169
retards, it goes down.

00:20:31.169 --> 00:20:39.860
The progress in Sahaj Yoga is only possible
when your attention is on the Spirit.

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:42.500
How do you nourish it?

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.950
That’s another point.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:47.480
The only solution is collectivity.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:54.279
A person who is not collectively nourished
cannot grow.

00:20:54.279 --> 00:20:59.500
He cannot grow whatever he may try.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:09.659
These are the two very important points of
Sahaj Yoga and one has to understand [that]

00:21:09.659 --> 00:21:12.660
this collectivity is to be grown within you.

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:15.619
But what do you become?

00:21:15.619 --> 00:21:19.200
Actually what do you become after your growth?

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:23.360
You become a collective being.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.350
So you have to nourish yourself in collectivity.

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:32.090
People just don’t understand this simple
point that you have to become the Collective

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:33.090
Being.

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:41.730
And that nourishment, if it is not growing
into you, then you are not a Sahaj Yogi at

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:42.730
all.

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:50.370
You are just having the trip of your ego or
your super-ego.

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:54.730
And this is very important.

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:59.009
By saying you are brothers and sisters and
this and that it’s not possible, I know

00:21:59.009 --> 00:22:00.009
that.

00:22:00.009 --> 00:22:01.009
It’s wrong.

00:22:01.009 --> 00:22:02.009
It’s another game.

00:22:02.009 --> 00:22:06.519
Just like baptism it’s another game to say,
“Oh, we are all united together and we are

00:22:06.519 --> 00:22:13.640
all brothers and sisters and nothing should
prevent us from being that."

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:19.640
Socially we can be alright, but politically
may not be, or economically we cannot be and

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:24.200
all sorts of things can come.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:28.409
But after Realisation, when the Kundalini
rises through these seven centres and pierces

00:22:28.409 --> 00:22:36.760
you through on the Sahastrara, then you start
feeling the vibrations, feeling the cool breeze

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.020
in your hand.

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:41.489
This is how your Spirit is talking to you.

00:22:41.489 --> 00:22:42.840
The rapport is established.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:47.669
You are connected with the Spirit.

00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:49.999
That’s the sign.

00:22:49.999 --> 00:22:56.239
If you are not connected then you have to
get connected, then we can talk about it.

00:22:56.239 --> 00:22:59.059
Before you are connected what is there to
talk?

00:22:59.059 --> 00:23:04.259
What is there to say?

00:23:04.259 --> 00:23:11.489
Supposing this (mic) is not connected, how
can I use it?

00:23:11.489 --> 00:23:12.489
Tell me.

00:23:12.489 --> 00:23:13.489
Is there any way?

00:23:13.489 --> 00:23:15.139
It’s so simple as that.

00:23:15.139 --> 00:23:19.139
Everything is so simple which you people have
made so complicated.

00:23:19.139 --> 00:23:22.210
To me, a simple person, I don’t understand.

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:27.659
I mean, it has to be connected or not?

00:23:27.659 --> 00:23:32.110
Any telephone is to be connected to the mains
or not?

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:36.489
So the connection has to be there.

00:23:36.489 --> 00:23:43.860
And once we decide the connection has to be
there then what are we doing about it?

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:47.359
That we are doing Sahaj Yoga.

00:23:47.359 --> 00:23:49.890
What is Sahaj Yog?

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:58.679
Is the right of every seeker to have this
connection with the Divine.

00:23:58.679 --> 00:24:05.100
This you are doing in your own right, no doubt.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:08.350
There I cannot challenge your right.

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:09.889
It’s your right.

00:24:09.889 --> 00:24:18.379
Say for example, in a government it’s decided
that all those people under sixteen must be

00:24:18.379 --> 00:24:19.980
given £5 each.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:27.149
Alright, as long as is under sixteen you have
a right and the government will see to it

00:24:27.149 --> 00:24:32.250
that they fulfil that promise, isn’t it?

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:39.539
In the same way you are promised that, in
the modern times, all those who will ask for

00:24:39.539 --> 00:24:41.350
Realisation will be granted.

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:42.950
What a promise to make!

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:44.039
Just imagine!

00:24:44.039 --> 00:24:48.519
And use me for that purpose, or Sahaj Yogis
for that purpose.

00:24:48.519 --> 00:24:57.909
This is being promised in many scriptures,
by many incarnations.

00:24:57.909 --> 00:25:03.559
The time has come and I have to give you Realisation.

00:25:03.559 --> 00:25:07.929
More and more people have to be given Realisation,
all those who ask for it.

00:25:07.929 --> 00:25:10.840
Of course it cannot be forced onto anyone!

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.749
This is your right!

00:25:12.749 --> 00:25:21.880
It is your right to ask for your property
but if nobody asks, the government won’t

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:27.070
go back on them and tell them, “Now, please
have it, we beg of you, we fall at your feet,”

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:28.509
and this and that.

00:25:28.509 --> 00:25:29.960
Do they do that?

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:36.130
In the same way, nobody is going to fall at
your feet, but if you ask for it, that’s

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:39.889
your right, and you can have it.

00:25:39.889 --> 00:25:46.499
But the difference is that the right is to
be exercised in a full way.

00:25:46.499 --> 00:25:55.020
If you ask a right that, “I want to become
the governor of a particular place,” then

00:25:55.020 --> 00:26:01.220
you should be able to assume that power.

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:09.859
In the same way, if you think you have right
then you must assume also the power of Spirit

00:26:09.859 --> 00:26:11.279
within you.

00:26:11.279 --> 00:26:15.169
You have to keep your attention to your Spirit.

00:26:15.169 --> 00:26:25.749
Now, the whole system of Spirit is so dynamic
and beyond human comprehension that you are

00:26:25.749 --> 00:26:28.029
suddenly amazed and surprised at it.

00:26:28.029 --> 00:26:31.609
First of all you are amazed.

00:26:31.609 --> 00:26:38.379
Then you start thinking, “How can that be
so simple?

00:26:38.379 --> 00:26:40.639
How can that be so easy?”

00:26:40.639 --> 00:26:43.809
I mean it’s not simple!

00:26:43.809 --> 00:26:52.379
In the sense that you have been made from
amoeba to this stage.

00:26:52.379 --> 00:26:54.830
Is it a simple thing to do?

00:26:54.830 --> 00:27:00.340
Can you make one dog into a human being?

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:03.909
Or even a horse, which you like very much.

00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:05.609
Can you?

00:27:05.609 --> 00:27:10.499
To make so many human beings out of amoeba,
isn’t it a difficult thing?

00:27:10.499 --> 00:27:17.429
And if you are made that, that evolution must
have rendered something within you, in that

00:27:17.429 --> 00:27:19.850
something is built in you.

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:24.230
And when it works out it looks simple, but
it is not.

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:33.210
It has a big background which is being worked
out to bring you to this stage, just to know

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:34.620
‘thyself.’

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:39.059
“Know Thyself,” simple words.

00:27:39.059 --> 00:27:49.460
It’s too simple for human comprehension
that’s why it is too difficult.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:52.139
Because they cannot go to simple things.

00:27:52.139 --> 00:27:53.149
“Know thyself”.

00:27:53.149 --> 00:27:54.669
What is ‘thyself’?

00:27:54.669 --> 00:27:58.239
You ask somebody, “Yes, I know myself very
well."

00:27:58.239 --> 00:28:01.289
“Now, what do you know about yourself?”

00:28:01.289 --> 00:28:05.159
“I like to go to pubs!”

00:28:05.159 --> 00:28:06.450
That’s thyself!

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:09.390
“I like to become something great."

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:10.390
“I like…”

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:12.830
That’s what you know your self?

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:15.759
What you like?

00:28:15.759 --> 00:28:17.450
Or else, “I am afraid."

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:19.049
“I am frightened."

00:28:19.049 --> 00:28:21.710
“I don’t believe in this."

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:23.840
“I don’t do this."

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:28.529
“Is this ‘I’ the one you are?

00:28:28.529 --> 00:28:30.850
Is it?”

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:36.330
Then they will say, “I am not sure."

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:43.769
But when you are the Self, that’s absolute
and that’s sure-shot that’s what you are.

00:28:43.769 --> 00:28:47.490
You know this is it.

00:28:47.490 --> 00:29:00.330
When you talk as a Spirit, you have no doubts,
you have no doubt at all, because the absolute

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:02.539
is established in you.

00:29:02.539 --> 00:29:10.230
For example, you take ten Sahaj Yogis, ten
small, little children who are Realised-souls,

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:17.679
and ask them to face a personality and ask
them, “What is the problem with this gentleman?”

00:29:17.679 --> 00:29:25.519
And immediately they will say that, “This
gentleman has got this finger problem or this

00:29:25.519 --> 00:29:26.730
finger problem."

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:34.179
All of them will say the same, with their
closed eyes.

00:29:34.179 --> 00:29:38.240
Everyone will say the same thing.

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:43.739
They’ll not criticise each other, because
everybody will feel the same thing.

00:29:43.739 --> 00:29:46.809
All the children will feel the same thing.

00:29:46.809 --> 00:29:48.169
You cannot befool children.

00:29:48.169 --> 00:29:52.159
They’ll say, “Yes, they are catching on
this finger!”

00:29:52.159 --> 00:29:55.510
And you ask the person, “Have you got bronchitis?”

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.820
He says, “Yes, I have!”

00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:02.700
Or something like that; even liver, anything
which is not even diagnosed by doctors.

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:10.749
Not only on physical side, on the emotional
side [also] you can say.

00:30:10.749 --> 00:30:15.139
I met a lady the other day and said, I asked
her, “Do you believe in anything?”

00:30:15.139 --> 00:30:16.139
She said, “I don’t believe in anything
whatsoever!”

00:30:16.139 --> 00:30:19.549
What sort of a thing is that?

00:30:19.549 --> 00:30:23.859
A personality and a personality I meet, I
tell you!

00:30:23.859 --> 00:30:25.779
One ‘better’ than the other!

00:30:25.779 --> 00:30:28.470
She said, “Only I believe in myself."

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:29.629
“Alright, doesn’t matter!

00:30:29.629 --> 00:30:35.570
Even then I am agreed that you believe in
yourself.

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:36.999
But where is your Self?

00:30:36.999 --> 00:30:39.409
Where is your Self; in what thing do you believe?”

00:30:39.409 --> 00:30:44.799
When that Self manifests, then you have no
questions, you are doubtless, you know this

00:30:44.799 --> 00:30:45.799
is it.

00:30:45.799 --> 00:30:55.019
You have no question about anything whatsoever,
you know everything.

00:30:55.019 --> 00:31:04.899
That’s how the vibrations tell you.

00:31:04.899 --> 00:31:07.859
This is the Spirit that tells you.

00:31:07.859 --> 00:31:11.210
The Spirit within you tells you.

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:12.590
You ask the Spirit, “What is to be done?”

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:15.399
You ask any question.

00:31:15.399 --> 00:31:23.159
For example, I was born in a Christian family
and in India people felt very funny that a

00:31:23.159 --> 00:31:27.460
lady who is supposed to give us our moksha
and our Realisation should be a Christian

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:32.360
lady because they thought she has to be a
Brahmin or something like that.

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:38.460
I am a Brahmin in a way because I am a Realised-soul.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:43.299
I have no caste and community, but I am a
Realised-soul.

00:31:43.299 --> 00:31:52.070
So, they asked me a question, “Mother, how
is it you were born a Christian?”

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:56.769
I said, “Alright, you ask on your vibrations:
‘Is Christ the son of God?’."

00:31:56.769 --> 00:32:09.049
Imagine for Hindus and Muslims, to accept
this is very difficult.

00:32:09.049 --> 00:32:14.230
And the vibrations [started flowing], and
the most orthodox of Hindus immediately, immediately

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:15.230
accepted.

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:19.519
For them one advantage is there that they
know that the cool breeze is the way you can

00:32:19.519 --> 00:32:23.870
make out that your Spirit is flowing, that’s
the only way.

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:26.109
They know, that’s an advantage they have.

00:32:26.109 --> 00:32:29.309
But they gave up all that, and a revolution
came into them!

00:32:29.309 --> 00:32:34.429
Imagine Hindus of India, who are such orthodox
people, have been dominated also by Muslims.

00:32:34.429 --> 00:32:38.619
Now they take the name of “Allah hu akbar,”!
They are trying to know the Namaz.

00:32:38.619 --> 00:32:41.710
They are trying to do the Namaz.

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:48.830
All this fanaticism is going to be finished,
absolutely crushed, as soon as the Spirit

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:50.730
starts manifesting itself.

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:56.279
Because only truth will be accepted.

00:32:56.279 --> 00:33:03.309
In the same way, we have Muslim disciples:
they have accepted Christ, they have accepted

00:33:03.309 --> 00:33:14.635
Ganesha, they have accepted everything, because
on the vibrations you see the truth is there!

00:33:14.635 --> 00:33:16.919
Fanatics will also have to come around.

00:33:16.919 --> 00:33:23.490
But first those who are doubting fanaticism
will first of all get it.

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:26.470
How can any fanatic be correct?

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:33.909
Because they are talking about one God and
they are in juxtaposition with each other.

00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:36.369
How can that be?

00:33:36.369 --> 00:33:38.220
But it’s so.

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:46.799
If you talk to a fanatic, who is an ardent
Muslim and an ardent Hindu – they hate each

00:33:46.799 --> 00:33:47.820
other!

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:52.249
They cannot understand how God could create
them, the one Person can create both of them.

00:33:52.249 --> 00:33:53.919
They think they have separate Gods!

00:33:53.919 --> 00:34:00.970
I don’t know how they carry on with their
fanaticism because I can’t understand.

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:08.290
But the entire truth about everything can
be known through your vibratory awareness!

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:18.850
And this vibratory awareness comes to you
through your attention which is enlightened

00:34:18.850 --> 00:34:19.850
by your Spirit.

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:21.230
This Spirit resides within us.

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:24.260
All the time it knows everything what we do.

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:29.760
It’s the one which knows all our feelings,
wherever we move.

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:37.110
But the same Spirit, when it enlightens our
attention, the thing that He’s enjoying,

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:43.669
itself, or it is enjoying itself, becomes
our experience.

00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:48.830
Because the Spirit is collectively conscious
and we become collectively conscious.

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:57.410
Those people who are not collectively conscious
are not Sahaj Yogis, they are absolutely just

00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:58.410
‘so-called’.

00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:06.280
First collective consciousness comes in, within
us, by feeling the cool breeze blowing through

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:12.220
our hands and by feeling all the fingers and
feeling all the chakras.

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:15.640
Some people don’t feel it in the hands if
their Vishuddhi is not alright, but still

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.570
they can feel within themselves.

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:24.480
Like there are devices I feel, as, if the
gas fails, then the electricity works out!

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:27.100
That also works out in many people.

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:31.680
You can feel it within yourself, where is
the problem and you can feel the chakras.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:40.040
That’s the first thing happens to you, that
you feel the collectivity within you.

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:43.360
That you are a collective being you feel.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:49.600
You also feel about yourself, what you are
catching, where you are catching.

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:59.780
And ultimately, then, you start feeling, nourishing
your collectivity.

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:04.420
Which is the point very much missed in the
individualistic society.

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:12.090
Because the whole of the individualistic society
is based on competition and there is no competition

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:13.180
in Sahaj Yoga.

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:15.340
It’s just the other way round.

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:19.710
That you nourish on other people.

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:24.930
The person who cannot carry on with other
Sahaj Yogis is a sure and certain person who

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:26.850
is going to get out of this.

00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:34.160
You have to nourish yourself on collectivity.

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:40.050
And once you start doing it, somehow or other,
you see, I have seen some people, it clicks

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:41.230
with them, sometimes.

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:45.570
But with some people I go on telling them,
“This way, that way” in so many ways I

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:47.970
try to work it out, it never clicks.

00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:50.690
But with some people it suddenly clicks and
they become different people.

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:53.314
Everybody then certifies, “Oh, they have
become very sweet now."

00:36:53.314 --> 00:37:01.190
But some of the people just go on, just like,
all the time they are like thorns, and anybody

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:05.430
they touch, that person gets a fright.

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:06.430
And then that person says, “Alright, I am
getting out.

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:10.400
I am not talking to anyone, I am not doing
this.

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.910
I am just keeping quiet."

00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:14.600
That’s all they can do.

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:20.120
They cannot take out that thorn from themselves
and can become one, articulate with others.

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:27.630
And when this thing happens, one has to know
that there’s something wrong.

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:32.560
After all, from where are you going to get
your nourishment?

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:40.730
The Spirit is shining, the sun is shining,
but your tree of life has to get your nourishment

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:42.520
from collectivity.

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:45.190
Once you realise that, it works wonders.

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:53.960
It has worked wonders with so many people
all over the world.

00:37:53.960 --> 00:38:00.570
But there’s a greater danger for people,
where individualism is regarded as something

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:08.630
great, where people think to be individualistic
in their attitude towards their selections

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:13.780
and choices and the decision-making.

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:21.950
For every small thing they will make a decision.

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:22.950
Why?

00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:26.530
What is the advantage?

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:29.960
What did you gain by wasting so much energy
in decision-making?

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:35.310
Whether you’ll have the fish and chips or
you’ll have hamburger!

00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:37.460
What does it mean?

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:39.080
Why waste so much energy on that?

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:45.770
Where is your attention?

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:54.140
All these things, all this attitude is nothing
but ego-oriented and is competitive.

00:38:54.140 --> 00:39:02.530
And also all the medias that are used are
just trying to exploit it.

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:07.120
Like they’ll say “If you have a cigar
it’s sufficient, you need not have a Rolls-Royce,”

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.280
or something like that.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:13.970
So you buy a cigar like a madcap.

00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:18.760
But if they put it in the television then
fifty percent [of] people will do it, as if

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:21.570
they have no brains to use.

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:26.310
It’s a mad world that way.

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:36.930
But it is not, in a way, because you are seekers.

00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:39.170
Have you ever seen so many seekers?

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:43.720
Seekers of Truth.

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:48.230
They are not only claiming, they mean it.

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:49.540
I know, they mean it.

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:51.190
They are not just claiming.

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:54.480
It’s not a fashion with them, they do mean
it.

00:39:54.480 --> 00:40:06.690
And I am really very happy about it that there
are seekers, those who are seeking, who are

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:13.800
honest and intelligent and who want to know
who they are.

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:17.660
Today, as I said, we’ll have a short programme.

00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:20.810
And there’s no end to my speeches.

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:29.550
I don’t know how many speeches I have given
now, I’ve lost count!

00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:38.810
This is only just to make your attention a
little steady – then the Kundalini rises.

00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:45.000
Without that happening your attention cannot
go inside.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.890
Once the happening takes place your attention
is pulled in.

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:56.870
The whole attention goes inside and it is
carried and is brought to this point where

00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:58.220
it breaks.

00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:03.090
This is the seat of your Spirit (on the Sahastrar),
while the seat (Spirit) resides in your heart.

00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:05.150
And you are blessed with your Self-realisation.

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:13.020
Now, the growth has to come, that you have
to move your awareness towards the Spirit.

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:21.250
And when that happens, that your Spirit dominates
your awareness, that your awareness becomes

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:23.820
the Spirit, then Satchitananda [begins].

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:29.870
‘Sat’ is the essence of your awareness,
is the Truth; through your awareness you know

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:30.870
the truth.

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:39.760
‘Chit’ is the attention and ‘anand’
is the Spirit.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:46.730
The essence of the Spirit is joy.

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:50.570
All these things become one.

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:54.240
That has to happen.

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:56.040
Then the growth is much faster.

00:41:56.040 --> 00:42:01.420
When it is half way round, the growth is less.

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:14.510
And the growth is to be felt in your collectivity
not in how you organise some things and all

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:15.510
that – no!

00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:16.510
In collectivity.

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:21.160
How you feel about the whole world, how you
are connected about the whole world.

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:22.730
What you are doing about it.

00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:24.650
Can you work it out for them?

00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:25.730
Where is your attention?

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:26.730
– Again.

00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:32.530
As soon as you go on your Spirit you will
start worrying about the whole universe.

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:34.180
It will happen.

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:36.380
The priorities will change.

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.320
“Oh, I am here, I am the Spirit.

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:39.470
And my work is not this.

00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:42.870
This is useless, this is not meant for me."

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:51.160
And the attention will start going from all
mundane, gross things to the spiritual side.

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:55.740
But by going there you become so dynamic that
all material things will work out just like

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:56.740
that.

00:42:56.740 --> 00:43:00.021
(Shri Mataji clicks Her fingers) You’ll
have no problem with material things, they

00:43:00.021 --> 00:43:01.021
will work out.

00:43:01.021 --> 00:43:11.820
I’ll tell you that a few examples are like
this: You know I am a married woman and I

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:12.820
have got grandchildren.

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:17.670
I run my house very well and I have a household
and mine is a marathon race!

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:21.520
I mean, all of you have a relay-race but I
have a marathon one.

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.460
And it works out.

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:27.680
But apart from that so many problems are solved.

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:30.400
I’ll give you a simple example.

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:33.380
Some girls have come from Australia.

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:38.010
They told me, related, many problems they
have solved.

00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:43.730
But one of them was very sweet that, there
was a lady: she very much wanted to come to

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:48.170
India to see me, and she thought her money
was not sufficient.

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:51.830
Now, money is absolutely material.

00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:57.190
And the little child, daughter she had, she
also wanted to come.

00:43:57.190 --> 00:44:00.440
And the girl was having a jumble-sale, something.

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:05.319
So she collected some of the trinkets here
and there and went for a jumble-sale.

00:44:05.319 --> 00:44:12.070
And they discovered that she had a very expensive
bracelet of gold, suddenly, which sold out

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:23.220
for the amount of money exactly required for
the ticket of the mother and the child.

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:24.860
Exactly!

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:28.850
Oh, this is nothing.

00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:32.480
There are many people who have known how materially
it works out.

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:38.330
For example we have a doctor of physics here
(Regis), who was doing his doctorate and he

00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:43.590
did it for years and years, I don’t remember
exactly how many years.

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:48.030
And he brought his papers to me, he said,
“Mother, I cannot now have anything more

00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:59.500
done, now I cannot even make it a fair thing.

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:12.300
I cannot put it in the bound.

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:20.030
And this is how I’m going to now present
it.

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:21.880
I am fed up.

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:26.510
I have finished every single pie (1/192 Rupee)
I had."

00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:27.900
I said, “Alright."

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:32.200
I just did like this to the thing (gave a
bandhan).

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:34.580
He said, “Are You not going to read?”

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:38.180
I said, “No, what is there to read?

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:39.180
It’s alright."

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:40.180
You won’t believe – he went next day to
see the gentleman and he became a doctor of

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:41.180
physics!

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:42.180
That’s how materially things work out.

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:43.180
Krishna has said it, “Yoga kshema vahamyaham."

00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:44.180
Yoga, when you get your yoga, when you are
connected with God, then He looks after you:

00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:45.180
kshema – your well-being.

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:47.350
This is so simple to understand.

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:53.460
There’s another very simple truth one should
understand that, if we are not connected with

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:56.310
Him, how can He look after us?

00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:59.630
We have to be connected with Him: so we know
His desires, we know His ways, we know how

00:45:59.630 --> 00:46:05.980
to please Him, we know what to do and so we
can ask for what we want.

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:08.140
You don’t even have to ask!

00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:14.680
You’ll be surprised how things work out
for you: how family relations improve, social

00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:16.280
relations improve, economic relations improve.

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:19.120
All these things are on your centres.

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:24.700
And as the Kundalini rises She starts spreading
sideways also and you start getting the effect.

00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:31.930
The first you get is the material and the
physical, and that’s how you know how we

00:46:31.930 --> 00:46:36.120
have cured people of cancer and things, just
like that!

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:38.220
(Shri Mataji snaps Her fingers)

00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:44.720
People don’t understand how we have done
it but we have.

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:49.980
Because Spirit is the dynamism within us,
it is the thing.

00:46:49.980 --> 00:47:04.030
Like one diamond which is put in a ring and
embedded in the soil, saved permanently, just

00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:10.870
to keep it out of problems, is suddenly discovered.

00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:13.000
And that’s why it is all we seek.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.620
The basis of all our existence is nothing
but our Spirit.

00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:23.500
That’s the basis, that’s the adhara, that’s
the support.

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:36.140
And to us it should be a special blessing
for our Lord, Jesus Christ, was the embodiment

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:37.280
of that Spirit.

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:41.110
He came on this earth just to show you the
way of your resurrection.

00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:44.190
It’s a special blessing to us.

00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:49.830
But Him also we have made it into a fanatic
stuff.

00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:51.890
We are ‘great’ people!

00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:57.780
Give anything to human beings and they know
how to make a good mess out of it!

00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:59.740
That’s what I have discovered.

00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:08.990
He was crucified: that was alright, because
He cannot be crucified, He cannot be killed,

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:09.990
that I know.

00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:16.380
But the way now He is clouded and how He is
plucked out of reality and put into something

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:20.120
false – sometimes it’s so shocking, frustrating
and so humiliating that you can’t imagine.

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:21.120
Whatever done is done.

00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:24.470
The quality of Spirit is forgiveness.

00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:27.830
The symbol of Spirit is Christ.

00:48:27.830 --> 00:48:42.350
And the power He has given us to forgive,
because He has that power to forgive.

00:48:42.350 --> 00:48:48.680
He’s the power of forgiveness.

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:53.610
He is the ocean of forgiveness.

00:48:53.610 --> 00:49:01.550
So, He’s so powerful that He cleanses you
through forgiveness.

00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:04.460
Just by forgiving you He cleanses you.

00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:08.430
And that’s how it works out.

00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:16.040
So you should not try to build a guilt in
your mind.

00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:20.220
That’s the only thing most of the Christians
do, is to sit down and build a guilt by spoiling

00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:21.220
this part of the chakra here.

00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:29.030
It’s amazing how it has
come to us, this guilt.

00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:36.580
Perhaps the psychologists or confessions,
I don’t know what it has been.

00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:39.930
They are guilty in imagination.

00:49:39.930 --> 00:49:42.800
And that part is very sad.

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:43.800
That does not help.

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:46.690
You are not to be guilty.

00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:48.030
You are the Spirit.

00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:51.170
What crime Spirit can do?

00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:52.170
Nothing!

00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:54.830
Only you have to get out of it, to become
that.

00:49:54.830 --> 00:49:57.010
That’s what we are going to have.

00:49:57.010 --> 00:49:58.010
And let us work it out.

00:49:58.010 --> 00:50:00.470
We have some new people over here.

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:04.580
I am sure it is going to work out.

00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:11.780
But for all the new people now, I have to
say one thing, that Sahaj Yoga is not a thing

00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:13.620
you just go for a programme and get out.

00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:14.620
It’s dangerous to do that.

00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:15.620
If you get your Realisation and still you
do not recognise Sahaj Yoga it will be very

00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:18.020
difficult for you to come back to Sahaj Yoga.

00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:21.170
So, please understand that, if you have found
the way, do not lose it.

00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:22.170
Try to follow it.

00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:23.170
I have nothing to gain from you.

00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:28.920
It is you who has to gain; that’s your right.

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:30.910
You better have it.

00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:38.370
May God bless you all.

00:50:38.370 --> 00:50:40.960
About these chakras and all that: we’ve
got some papers, which you can see yourself

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:42.860
and read and you can understand.

00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:44.370
Is there?

00:50:44.370 --> 00:50:51.049
So, let us, put your hands like this and we’ll
work it out.
