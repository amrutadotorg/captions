WEBVTT

00:02.330 --> 00:10.639
Today we are going to have a short session,
because you are all invited today to a dinner

00:10.639 --> 00:15.440
after the programme.

00:15.440 --> 00:29.920
The host is my husband who wants to invite
you and he’ll be coming about 8:15 or 8:30.

00:29.920 --> 00:44.370
So, today we are going to think about our
Spirit, which we have neglected throughout.

00:44.370 --> 00:52.940
We are not even conscious that we have a Spirit.

00:52.940 --> 01:03.760
Through Sahaj Yoga those who are now conscious,
because they can feel it through their vibrations,

01:03.760 --> 01:11.520
they can also get lost and can forget it.

01:11.520 --> 01:25.230
The Spirit is the only eternal thing within
us, all the rest are transitory and evolutionary.

01:25.230 --> 01:34.380
Everything goes into evolution and the better
is the evolution, the higher the Spirit starts

01:34.380 --> 01:39.150
manifesting itself.

01:39.150 --> 01:50.940
Like the reflection on the stone of even the
sun is zero.

01:50.940 --> 02:05.200
And the reflection of the sun on the lake
is sometimes I think, is a reflection that

02:05.200 --> 02:15.920
is felt in the Sahaj Yogis, when they see
it, feel it, it flows, they can feel the breeze

02:15.920 --> 02:19.240
in their hand.

02:19.240 --> 02:33.060
But still their attention is not fully enlightened.

02:33.060 --> 02:37.280
The Spirit has not permeated inside.

02:37.280 --> 02:42.800
It’s just reflecting still.

02:42.800 --> 02:54.180
In the mirror you see the reflection of the
sun.

02:54.180 --> 03:03.470
But even then, when you remove it you cannot
reflect it.

03:03.470 --> 03:19.430
This is the difference – that even if you
become the mirror of the sun, unless and until

03:19.430 --> 03:27.569
it permeates into your being and transforms
you into something new, you have not done

03:27.569 --> 03:32.580
full justice to yourself and nor to the powers
of your Spirit.

03:32.580 --> 03:43.650
The Spirit has come just like a vision to
you, an experience to you, but the growth

03:43.650 --> 03:45.410
of your being has not yet started.

03:45.410 --> 03:51.390
And if it has started it’s so slow that
you may not achieve much in one lifetime.

03:51.390 --> 03:58.170
Because your attention is on all various things.

03:58.170 --> 04:01.620
You have been misidentified from the very
beginning.

04:01.620 --> 04:06.640
Since the time you were amoeba you have been
misidentified.

04:06.640 --> 04:11.120
The matter played a big role in your life,
so matter was important.

04:11.120 --> 04:17.690
Then all the five elements that are within
us were very important to us.

04:17.690 --> 04:22.169
Because we can see them, feel them, we have
lived them for years, thousands and thousands

04:22.169 --> 04:23.949
of years.

04:23.949 --> 04:31.809
So they are part and parcel of your being
and that is why you are so much identified

04:31.809 --> 04:32.809
with it.

04:32.809 --> 04:34.710
Naturally, no doubt.

04:34.710 --> 04:40.280
But in the living process it never happens
like that.

04:40.280 --> 04:52.070
There are some seeds which grow so fast that
within one year they become trees after they

04:52.070 --> 04:53.990
have been sprouted.

04:53.990 --> 04:57.240
They bear fruit in one year’s time.

04:57.240 --> 05:09.540
Some trees are such, but some of them linger
on and linger on and linger on and they take

05:09.540 --> 05:18.439
too much time, so much so that maybe when
they are not yet fully developed any storm,

05:18.439 --> 05:25.969
any wind, any one of these things can just
push them down.

05:25.969 --> 05:28.169
So you have to make a rapid growth within.

05:28.169 --> 05:41.180
Even after realisation I have seen people
do not pay attention to their Spirit.

05:41.180 --> 05:46.099
So for every Sahaj Yogi today I would say
they have to ask, “Where is your attention,

05:46.099 --> 05:47.099
Mr?”

05:47.099 --> 05:48.099
Or Mrs.

05:48.099 --> 05:50.619
or Miss, whatever it is.

05:50.619 --> 05:55.099
“Where is your attention?”

05:55.099 --> 06:05.229
For example we can be enveloped with problem-solving
something absolutely useless.

06:05.229 --> 06:09.819
Specially in the West we do it much more than
in the East because we take it for granted

06:09.819 --> 06:12.029
in the East, many things.

06:12.029 --> 06:18.979
But here because we think by planning we have
achieved a lot, we start planning.

06:18.979 --> 06:26.379
We start planning about going to a place,
and buying a ticket, and doing this and doing

06:26.379 --> 06:28.169
that; everything is too planned out.

06:28.169 --> 06:36.960
All the time we are wasting on something which
does not require any time at all.

06:36.960 --> 06:40.490
Supposing you have to go somewhere, alright.

06:40.490 --> 06:47.809
First of all I don’t know if going is that
important, but to some people that is much

06:47.809 --> 06:48.809
more important.

06:48.809 --> 06:54.090
Like one gentleman today came with his family
to see me, specially to meet me, according

06:54.090 --> 06:55.090
to him!

06:55.090 --> 06:57.089
I don’t know how far to believe.

06:57.089 --> 07:00.120
So he wanted to have a special interview with
me in my house.

07:00.120 --> 07:04.720
He had it and that’s how I am late.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.770
He doesn’t mind that.

07:06.770 --> 07:11.399
Then now he cannot come to the programme because
he has got some friends whom he has to meet.

07:11.399 --> 07:17.030
His wife has not got Realisation, does not
matter [to him].

07:17.030 --> 07:21.599
Because his friends are very loving people,
very good, they have been very kind to him,

07:21.599 --> 07:23.259
he must meet them.

07:23.259 --> 07:27.379
Where is the attention?

07:27.379 --> 07:35.629
All these misidentifications we have, like
marriage also.

07:35.629 --> 07:40.120
Some people come to me and tell me, “Mother,
we are very happily married,” or unhappily

07:40.120 --> 07:41.120
married.

07:41.120 --> 07:45.740
Or the one who is happily married is equally
a headache as the unhappily married.

07:45.740 --> 07:50.300
The unhappily one you can understand why he’s
a headache.

07:50.300 --> 07:53.259
But the happily married also says, “I must
do something for wife.

07:53.259 --> 07:54.349
I have not done anything.

07:54.349 --> 07:56.039
I haven’t bought her a diamond ring.

07:56.039 --> 07:57.360
I must buy for her."

07:57.360 --> 08:00.099
“I haven’t done this thing for her, I
must get her a Rolls-Royce, and do all this

08:00.099 --> 08:01.099
and that."

08:01.099 --> 08:03.220
But where is your attention?

08:03.220 --> 08:23.330
The whole attention is diverted to things,
which has no play, which has no meaning, which

08:23.330 --> 08:25.710
helps you nowhere.

08:25.710 --> 08:33.550
Then the attention is, in a subtler way, in
many other things, like children.

08:33.550 --> 08:41.360
Now children, if I say anything they’ll
say, “Mother, do you want us to neglect

08:41.360 --> 08:42.360
the children?”

08:42.360 --> 08:43.840
This is the problem.

08:43.840 --> 08:47.830
Children are not looked after by you, they
are looked after by God.

08:47.830 --> 08:51.740
You are just a instrument of God to look after
them.

08:51.740 --> 08:55.990
The more you are with God, the better you
are with your children, you know how to handle

08:55.990 --> 09:01.640
them, you are kinder to them, you know how
to solve their problems much better if you

09:01.640 --> 09:03.380
are getting your power from God.

09:03.380 --> 09:12.501
But if you are not interested in God, He is
not either interested in you.

09:12.501 --> 09:16.830
That’s the thing we do not understand.

09:16.830 --> 09:25.260
We think that if we are interested in God,
we are obliging Him.

09:25.260 --> 09:38.660
Supposing you are interested in a job you
never think that way that you are obliging

09:38.660 --> 09:41.080
the job.

09:41.080 --> 09:47.340
But as far as the God is concerned we think
“Why?

09:47.340 --> 09:56.080
We are obliging God!”

09:56.080 --> 09:59.400
You are not obliging God at all, He is obliging
you.

09:59.400 --> 10:04.690
The attitude is so funny among human beings
that you can’t imagine!

10:04.690 --> 10:15.200
All the time they feel they are obliging God
and they are doing something for the God.

10:15.200 --> 10:19.010
What can you do for Him?

10:19.010 --> 10:20.500
Just think like that.

10:20.500 --> 10:25.540
I met a lady, she said: “Oh, how did I get
cancer?

10:25.540 --> 10:26.540
I don’t understand.

10:26.540 --> 10:28.430
I used to always pray to God."

10:28.430 --> 10:35.321
According to her, if she prayed to God, she
thinks she’s paid Him the money for His

10:35.321 --> 10:39.630
job and He better look after her!

10:39.630 --> 10:45.650
It is you who are obliged by His kindness,
by His compassion.

10:45.650 --> 10:50.570
He is so gracious that He knows that you are
stupid.

10:50.570 --> 10:52.760
He knows that you don’t know this.

10:52.760 --> 10:56.270
He forgives you for your stupidity.

10:56.270 --> 11:07.900
He knows that you are naive and that you are
children, that you are small, still not grown,

11:07.900 --> 11:09.200
you are not matured enough.

11:09.200 --> 11:13.180
If you are egoistical, He forgives you.

11:13.180 --> 11:15.650
Because He’s compassionate.

11:15.650 --> 11:17.490
But do not take it for granted!

11:17.490 --> 11:23.480
Do not take it for granted!

11:23.480 --> 11:35.500
Those who think that, “We can do whatever
we like and behave in whatever way we like,

11:35.500 --> 11:39.300
as long as we pray to God.

11:39.300 --> 11:43.260
Yes, He’ll do everything for us."

11:43.260 --> 11:45.240
Why should He?

11:45.240 --> 11:47.880
Where is our attention?

11:47.880 --> 11:49.860
What is yoga?

11:49.860 --> 11:53.602
In simple words, it is taking your attention
to the Spirit.

11:53.602 --> 11:57.680
This is yoga.

11:57.680 --> 12:03.670
What does the Kundalini do?

12:03.670 --> 12:08.210
She raises your attention and takes it to
the Spirit.

12:08.210 --> 12:13.980
Only after knowing the Spirit you can know
God, not before that.

12:13.980 --> 12:19.560
That’s why all religions have failed.

12:19.560 --> 12:29.930
The incarnations who came to propound these
religions said that again and again.

12:29.930 --> 12:32.130
For example Christ said that you are to be
born again.

12:32.130 --> 12:38.120
Alright, if you have to be born again, what
did we do?

12:38.120 --> 12:42.050
“We got some people, certified that they
can give you rebirth."

12:42.050 --> 12:49.370
So they will have some water very nicely put
in a very beautiful place in the church and

12:49.370 --> 12:54.110
you very solemnly walk down, and they put
some water on your head and they said, “You

12:54.110 --> 12:55.900
are now reborn!”

12:55.900 --> 12:58.829
And you accept it!

12:58.829 --> 12:59.829
You just accept it!

12:59.829 --> 13:06.130
As a child – because you know I was born
in a Christian family – I used to laugh,

13:06.130 --> 13:07.990
I used to say, “What’s this mockery going
on?”

13:07.990 --> 13:13.750
I thought they are just playing like children,
though I was a child, but I used to think

13:13.750 --> 13:15.350
they are really playing.

13:15.350 --> 13:18.130
I didn’t know they were seriously doing
it!

13:18.130 --> 13:19.130
(laughter).

13:19.130 --> 13:21.180
Really, I did not know, till quite some time.

13:21.180 --> 13:25.390
When I grew up I was surprised, they are serious
about it!

13:25.390 --> 13:30.980
I mean, they believed in it, they believed
they were getting rebirth and “It’s baptism,

13:30.980 --> 13:33.760
that’s the way it should be."

13:33.760 --> 13:36.000
I really felt it.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.680
I was amazed!

13:37.680 --> 13:43.120
And how people were satisfied with that was
a greater amazement to me!

13:43.120 --> 13:50.200
They would not ask, they would not challenge,
they would not say anything about it; whether,

13:50.200 --> 13:52.930
“Am I really realised or not?

13:52.930 --> 13:54.750
Am I really reborn?”

13:54.750 --> 13:57.390
In the same way among Hindus, they do the
same nonsense.

13:57.390 --> 13:59.110
Same thing they do.

13:59.110 --> 14:01.540
When the child is about eight years of age,
or say, from five years to eight years they

14:01.540 --> 14:03.590
call it as a ‘Yajnopavit samskara’.

14:03.590 --> 14:11.130
(sacred thread ceremony) That is the day they
have to invite lots of people for dinner as

14:11.130 --> 14:15.130
we have – you see, everything must have
a dinner with it!

14:15.130 --> 14:19.400
The attention is more there (on food)!

14:19.400 --> 14:24.180
And then they have a big function and then
they have a big puja, this that.

14:24.180 --> 14:30.000
And the Brahmins, who are not connected with
God, are doing all the puja and worshipping

14:30.000 --> 14:33.750
and everything and God is nowhere there!

14:33.750 --> 14:41.050
And then the fellow gets a thread which is
to certify that he’s a Brahmin, from a person

14:41.050 --> 14:44.480
who has certified himself that he’s a Brahmin!

14:44.480 --> 14:47.310
It’s all self-certification and falsehood!

14:47.310 --> 14:50.711
For a person like me it was amazing!

14:50.711 --> 14:58.230
And I used to wonder, “What’s the matter
with these people?”

14:58.230 --> 15:00.410
How have they taken all these things into
their hands?

15:00.410 --> 15:04.290
Why don’t they question themselves once
for all?

15:04.290 --> 15:10.260
“How we are doing?”

15:10.260 --> 15:18.260
Not only [that] but I found them to be completely
mesmerised with the idea that they are doing

15:18.260 --> 15:19.910
the right thing.

15:19.910 --> 15:26.050
Every Monday I hear the people singing next
to my house.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.180
What are they singing?

15:27.180 --> 15:28.290
God alone knows!

15:28.290 --> 15:34.150
They come, very well organised, just to sing
some sort of hymns and things like that, which

15:34.150 --> 15:37.890
has no meaning, which is not going to reach
to God.

15:37.890 --> 15:39.410
Where is their attention?

15:39.410 --> 15:45.240
The attention has to be on the Spirit and
that cannot be there unless and until something

15:45.240 --> 15:49.120
happens within you.

15:49.120 --> 15:56.570
But those who have been seeking that attention,
those who have been asking that, “Oh Lord,

15:56.570 --> 16:07.800
keep my attention on God and on seeking,”
are, the people, going to be blessed; not

16:07.800 --> 16:13.380
the people who have their attention [elsewhere]:
now supposing in the morning they go to the

16:13.380 --> 16:17.450
church and next day to the races, and third
day somewhere else.

16:17.450 --> 16:21.780
Again on a Sunday morning they are there back
in the church, regularly.

16:21.780 --> 16:25.860
And they say, “I regularly go to the church!”

16:25.860 --> 16:36.360
The attention has to be on the Spirit, even
before and after Realisation.

16:36.360 --> 16:42.819
Many people ask us, “Mother, then what should
people do before Realisation?”

16:42.819 --> 16:50.260
They should put their attention on their Spirit,
asking for it, that, “Take my attention,

16:50.260 --> 16:53.350
Oh my Lord, to my Spirit."

16:53.350 --> 16:57.930
And not to accept something which is false
and nonsensical.

16:57.930 --> 17:03.390
Because once you start accepting something
false it sits on your head.

17:03.390 --> 17:11.130
It’s a vicious circle: you have to go ahead
with it and you don’t know where you are

17:11.130 --> 17:17.260
and by the time you realise, you find you
are too old to give it up and you carry on,

17:17.260 --> 17:18.260
somehow.

17:18.260 --> 17:19.959
It’s like intoxication.

17:19.959 --> 17:24.209
All falsehood of the world is an intoxication!

17:24.209 --> 17:30.269
Because if it was not intoxicating or hypnotising,
why people carry on with it?

17:30.269 --> 17:36.919
I mean, to me, I don’t understand: when
you know it is falsehood, why should you carry

17:36.919 --> 17:37.919
on with it?

17:37.919 --> 17:39.759
Of course, you can play with it.

17:39.759 --> 17:42.240
That’s a different thing, just to play.

17:42.240 --> 17:44.440
Just like children: they build everything.

17:44.440 --> 17:49.160
If you tell “Put them on the sand,” they’ll
build a big castle and they’ll make a house

17:49.160 --> 17:52.690
and they’ll make a cowshed and everything.

17:52.690 --> 17:57.900
And [afterwards] just they break everything,
take it out, clear out the whole thing.

17:57.900 --> 17:59.549
They know it’s just a play they have done
it.

17:59.549 --> 18:01.879
They are conscious of it.

18:01.879 --> 18:09.940
If this consciousness is there, then one should
say that such people are seekers.

18:09.940 --> 18:15.750
That is the category of seekers, where they
are not satisfied with falsehood and they

18:15.750 --> 18:17.899
want to find out the Truth.

18:17.899 --> 18:24.289
Now the Truth is that the Spirit is within
you and you are the Spirit.

18:24.289 --> 18:29.659
You are the beauty, the bliss and the joy
of that Spirit.

18:29.659 --> 18:31.330
That’s what you are.

18:31.330 --> 18:39.320
Because your attention is not there that’s
why you cannot feel your Spirit.

18:39.320 --> 18:48.070
But your Spirit exists, it is within you,
in your heart, waiting for a moment to come

18:48.070 --> 18:55.249
into your conscious mind, to be felt by you
in your central nervous system.

18:55.249 --> 19:01.119
It’s all there, built within you.

19:01.119 --> 19:11.590
Man in his madness doesn’t realise that
God has made him from amoeba to this stage

19:11.590 --> 19:12.659
for some purpose.

19:12.659 --> 19:22.340
There is a big purpose behind everything,
and the purpose is that now you have to know

19:22.340 --> 19:28.429
your Spirit by which you enter into the Kingdom
of God.

19:28.429 --> 19:31.000
You have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
How?

19:32.000 --> 19:35.350
What is your passport?

19:35.350 --> 19:37.480
Is your Spirit.

19:37.480 --> 19:44.880
Because when the Spirit starts shining within
you, you start transforming.

19:44.880 --> 19:55.820
You start transforming into a new being, into
a new personality with a new awareness and

19:55.820 --> 19:59.749
you are a different person.

19:59.749 --> 20:01.570
Your priorities change.

20:01.570 --> 20:12.159
But those who are not really good seekers
I would say, may have a three-legged race,

20:12.159 --> 20:14.240
as I call that.

20:14.240 --> 20:16.739
They’ll be identified with something else.

20:16.739 --> 20:17.940
What is a three-legged race?

20:17.940 --> 20:21.400
Is that you are tied with one leg to another
personality.

20:21.400 --> 20:28.239
Now this could be the job, this could be anything
else, and you are tied with it and the progress

20:28.239 --> 20:31.169
retards, it goes down.

20:31.169 --> 20:39.860
The progress in Sahaj Yoga is only possible
when your attention is on the Spirit.

20:39.860 --> 20:42.500
How do you nourish it?

20:42.500 --> 20:44.950
That’s another point.

20:44.950 --> 20:47.480
The only solution is collectivity.

20:47.480 --> 20:54.279
A person who is not collectively nourished
cannot grow.

20:54.279 --> 20:59.500
He cannot grow whatever he may try.

20:59.500 --> 21:09.659
These are the two very important points of
Sahaj Yoga and one has to understand [that]

21:09.659 --> 21:12.660
this collectivity is to be grown within you.

21:12.660 --> 21:15.619
But what do you become?

21:15.619 --> 21:19.200
Actually what do you become after your growth?

21:19.200 --> 21:23.360
You become a collective being.

21:23.360 --> 21:26.350
So you have to nourish yourself in collectivity.

21:26.350 --> 21:32.090
People just don’t understand this simple
point that you have to become the Collective

21:32.090 --> 21:33.090
Being.

21:33.090 --> 21:41.730
And that nourishment, if it is not growing
into you, then you are not a Sahaj Yogi at

21:41.730 --> 21:42.730
all.

21:42.730 --> 21:50.370
You are just having the trip of your ego or
your super-ego.

21:50.370 --> 21:54.730
And this is very important.

21:54.730 --> 21:59.009
By saying you are brothers and sisters and
this and that it’s not possible, I know

21:59.009 --> 22:00.009
that.

22:00.009 --> 22:01.009
It’s wrong.

22:01.009 --> 22:02.009
It’s another game.

22:02.009 --> 22:06.519
Just like baptism it’s another game to say,
“Oh, we are all united together and we are

22:06.519 --> 22:13.640
all brothers and sisters and nothing should
prevent us from being that."

22:13.640 --> 22:19.640
Socially we can be alright, but politically
may not be, or economically we cannot be and

22:19.640 --> 22:24.200
all sorts of things can come.

22:24.200 --> 22:28.409
But after Realisation, when the Kundalini
rises through these seven centres and pierces

22:28.409 --> 22:36.760
you through on the Sahastrara, then you start
feeling the vibrations, feeling the cool breeze

22:36.760 --> 22:38.020
in your hand.

22:38.020 --> 22:41.489
This is how your Spirit is talking to you.

22:41.489 --> 22:42.840
The rapport is established.

22:42.840 --> 22:47.669
You are connected with the Spirit.

22:47.669 --> 22:49.999
That’s the sign.

22:49.999 --> 22:56.239
If you are not connected then you have to
get connected, then we can talk about it.

22:56.239 --> 22:59.059
Before you are connected what is there to
talk?

22:59.059 --> 23:04.259
What is there to say?

23:04.259 --> 23:11.489
Supposing this (mic) is not connected, how
can I use it?

23:11.489 --> 23:12.489
Tell me.

23:12.489 --> 23:13.489
Is there any way?

23:13.489 --> 23:15.139
It’s so simple as that.

23:15.139 --> 23:19.139
Everything is so simple which you people have
made so complicated.

23:19.139 --> 23:22.210
To me, a simple person, I don’t understand.

23:22.210 --> 23:27.659
I mean, it has to be connected or not?

23:27.659 --> 23:32.110
Any telephone is to be connected to the mains
or not?

23:32.110 --> 23:36.489
So the connection has to be there.

23:36.489 --> 23:43.860
And once we decide the connection has to be
there then what are we doing about it?

23:43.860 --> 23:47.359
That we are doing Sahaj Yoga.

23:47.359 --> 23:49.890
What is Sahaj Yog?

23:49.890 --> 23:58.679
Is the right of every seeker to have this
connection with the Divine.

23:58.679 --> 24:05.100
This you are doing in your own right, no doubt.

24:05.100 --> 24:08.350
There I cannot challenge your right.

24:08.350 --> 24:09.889
It’s your right.

24:09.889 --> 24:18.379
Say for example, in a government it’s decided
that all those people under sixteen must be

24:18.379 --> 24:19.980
given £5 each.

24:19.980 --> 24:27.149
Alright, as long as is under sixteen you have
a right and the government will see to it

24:27.149 --> 24:32.250
that they fulfil that promise, isn’t it?

24:32.250 --> 24:39.539
In the same way you are promised that, in
the modern times, all those who will ask for

24:39.539 --> 24:41.350
Realisation will be granted.

24:41.350 --> 24:42.950
What a promise to make!

24:42.950 --> 24:44.039
Just imagine!

24:44.039 --> 24:48.519
And use me for that purpose, or Sahaj Yogis
for that purpose.

24:48.519 --> 24:57.909
This is being promised in many scriptures,
by many incarnations.

24:57.909 --> 25:03.559
The time has come and I have to give you Realisation.

25:03.559 --> 25:07.929
More and more people have to be given Realisation,
all those who ask for it.

25:07.929 --> 25:10.840
Of course it cannot be forced onto anyone!

25:10.840 --> 25:12.749
This is your right!

25:12.749 --> 25:21.880
It is your right to ask for your property
but if nobody asks, the government won’t

25:21.880 --> 25:27.070
go back on them and tell them, “Now, please
have it, we beg of you, we fall at your feet,”

25:27.070 --> 25:28.509
and this and that.

25:28.509 --> 25:29.960
Do they do that?

25:29.960 --> 25:36.130
In the same way, nobody is going to fall at
your feet, but if you ask for it, that’s

25:36.130 --> 25:39.889
your right, and you can have it.

25:39.889 --> 25:46.499
But the difference is that the right is to
be exercised in a full way.

25:46.499 --> 25:55.020
If you ask a right that, “I want to become
the governor of a particular place,” then

25:55.020 --> 26:01.220
you should be able to assume that power.

26:01.220 --> 26:09.859
In the same way, if you think you have right
then you must assume also the power of Spirit

26:09.859 --> 26:11.279
within you.

26:11.279 --> 26:15.169
You have to keep your attention to your Spirit.

26:15.169 --> 26:25.749
Now, the whole system of Spirit is so dynamic
and beyond human comprehension that you are

26:25.749 --> 26:28.029
suddenly amazed and surprised at it.

26:28.029 --> 26:31.609
First of all you are amazed.

26:31.609 --> 26:38.379
Then you start thinking, “How can that be
so simple?

26:38.379 --> 26:40.639
How can that be so easy?”

26:40.639 --> 26:43.809
I mean it’s not simple!

26:43.809 --> 26:52.379
In the sense that you have been made from
amoeba to this stage.

26:52.379 --> 26:54.830
Is it a simple thing to do?

26:54.830 --> 27:00.340
Can you make one dog into a human being?

27:00.340 --> 27:03.909
Or even a horse, which you like very much.

27:03.909 --> 27:05.609
Can you?

27:05.609 --> 27:10.499
To make so many human beings out of amoeba,
isn’t it a difficult thing?

27:10.499 --> 27:17.429
And if you are made that, that evolution must
have rendered something within you, in that

27:17.429 --> 27:19.850
something is built in you.

27:19.850 --> 27:24.230
And when it works out it looks simple, but
it is not.

27:24.230 --> 27:33.210
It has a big background which is being worked
out to bring you to this stage, just to know

27:33.210 --> 27:34.620
‘thyself.’

27:34.620 --> 27:39.059
“Know Thyself,” simple words.

27:39.059 --> 27:49.460
It’s too simple for human comprehension
that’s why it is too difficult.

27:49.460 --> 27:52.139
Because they cannot go to simple things.

27:52.139 --> 27:53.149
“Know thyself”.

27:53.149 --> 27:54.669
What is ‘thyself’?

27:54.669 --> 27:58.239
You ask somebody, “Yes, I know myself very
well."

27:58.239 --> 28:01.289
“Now, what do you know about yourself?”

28:01.289 --> 28:05.159
“I like to go to pubs!”

28:05.159 --> 28:06.450
That’s thyself!

28:06.450 --> 28:09.390
“I like to become something great."

28:09.390 --> 28:10.390
“I like…”

28:10.390 --> 28:12.830
That’s what you know your self?

28:12.830 --> 28:15.759
What you like?

28:15.759 --> 28:17.450
Or else, “I am afraid."

28:17.450 --> 28:19.049
“I am frightened."

28:19.049 --> 28:21.710
“I don’t believe in this."

28:21.710 --> 28:23.840
“I don’t do this."

28:23.840 --> 28:28.529
“Is this ‘I’ the one you are?

28:28.529 --> 28:30.850
Is it?”

28:30.850 --> 28:36.330
Then they will say, “I am not sure."

28:36.330 --> 28:43.769
But when you are the Self, that’s absolute
and that’s sure-shot that’s what you are.

28:43.769 --> 28:47.490
You know this is it.

28:47.490 --> 29:00.330
When you talk as a Spirit, you have no doubts,
you have no doubt at all, because the absolute

29:00.330 --> 29:02.539
is established in you.

29:02.539 --> 29:10.230
For example, you take ten Sahaj Yogis, ten
small, little children who are Realised-souls,

29:10.230 --> 29:17.679
and ask them to face a personality and ask
them, “What is the problem with this gentleman?”

29:17.679 --> 29:25.519
And immediately they will say that, “This
gentleman has got this finger problem or this

29:25.519 --> 29:26.730
finger problem."

29:26.730 --> 29:34.179
All of them will say the same, with their
closed eyes.

29:34.179 --> 29:38.240
Everyone will say the same thing.

29:38.240 --> 29:43.739
They’ll not criticise each other, because
everybody will feel the same thing.

29:43.739 --> 29:46.809
All the children will feel the same thing.

29:46.809 --> 29:48.169
You cannot befool children.

29:48.169 --> 29:52.159
They’ll say, “Yes, they are catching on
this finger!”

29:52.159 --> 29:55.510
And you ask the person, “Have you got bronchitis?”

29:55.510 --> 29:57.820
He says, “Yes, I have!”

29:57.820 --> 30:02.700
Or something like that; even liver, anything
which is not even diagnosed by doctors.

30:02.700 --> 30:10.749
Not only on physical side, on the emotional
side [also] you can say.

30:10.749 --> 30:15.139
I met a lady the other day and said, I asked
her, “Do you believe in anything?”

30:15.139 --> 30:16.139
She said, “I don’t believe in anything
whatsoever!”

30:16.139 --> 30:19.549
What sort of a thing is that?

30:19.549 --> 30:23.859
A personality and a personality I meet, I
tell you!

30:23.859 --> 30:25.779
One ‘better’ than the other!

30:25.779 --> 30:28.470
She said, “Only I believe in myself."

30:28.470 --> 30:29.629
“Alright, doesn’t matter!

30:29.629 --> 30:35.570
Even then I am agreed that you believe in
yourself.

30:35.570 --> 30:36.999
But where is your Self?

30:36.999 --> 30:39.409
Where is your Self; in what thing do you believe?”

30:39.409 --> 30:44.799
When that Self manifests, then you have no
questions, you are doubtless, you know this

30:44.799 --> 30:45.799
is it.

30:45.799 --> 30:55.019
You have no question about anything whatsoever,
you know everything.

30:55.019 --> 31:04.899
That’s how the vibrations tell you.

31:04.899 --> 31:07.859
This is the Spirit that tells you.

31:07.859 --> 31:11.210
The Spirit within you tells you.

31:11.210 --> 31:12.590
You ask the Spirit, “What is to be done?”

31:12.590 --> 31:15.399
You ask any question.

31:15.399 --> 31:23.159
For example, I was born in a Christian family
and in India people felt very funny that a

31:23.159 --> 31:27.460
lady who is supposed to give us our moksha
and our Realisation should be a Christian

31:27.460 --> 31:32.360
lady because they thought she has to be a
Brahmin or something like that.

31:32.360 --> 31:38.460
I am a Brahmin in a way because I am a Realised-soul.

31:38.460 --> 31:43.299
I have no caste and community, but I am a
Realised-soul.

31:43.299 --> 31:52.070
So, they asked me a question, “Mother, how
is it you were born a Christian?”

31:52.070 --> 31:56.769
I said, “Alright, you ask on your vibrations:
‘Is Christ the son of God?’."

31:56.769 --> 32:09.049
Imagine for Hindus and Muslims, to accept
this is very difficult.

32:09.049 --> 32:14.230
And the vibrations [started flowing], and
the most orthodox of Hindus immediately, immediately

32:14.230 --> 32:15.230
accepted.

32:15.230 --> 32:19.519
For them one advantage is there that they
know that the cool breeze is the way you can

32:19.519 --> 32:23.870
make out that your Spirit is flowing, that’s
the only way.

32:23.870 --> 32:26.109
They know, that’s an advantage they have.

32:26.109 --> 32:29.309
But they gave up all that, and a revolution
came into them!

32:29.309 --> 32:34.429
Imagine Hindus of India, who are such orthodox
people, have been dominated also by Muslims.

32:34.429 --> 32:38.619
Now they take the name of “Allah hu akbar,”!
They are trying to know the namaz.

32:38.619 --> 32:41.710
They are trying to do the namaz.

32:41.710 --> 32:48.830
All this fanaticism is going to be finished,
absolutely crushed, as soon as the Spirit

32:48.830 --> 32:50.730
starts manifesting itself.

32:50.730 --> 32:56.279
Because only truth will be accepted.

32:56.279 --> 33:03.309
In the same way, we have Muslim disciples:
they have accepted Christ, they have accepted

33:03.309 --> 33:14.635
Ganesha, they have accepted everything, because
on the vibrations you see the truth is there!

33:14.635 --> 33:16.919
Fanatics will also have to come around.

33:16.919 --> 33:23.490
But first those who are doubting fanaticism
will first of all get it.

33:23.490 --> 33:26.470
How can any fanatic be correct?

33:26.470 --> 33:33.909
Because they are talking about one God and
they are in juxtaposition with each other.

33:33.909 --> 33:36.369
How can that be?

33:36.369 --> 33:38.220
But it’s so.

33:38.220 --> 33:46.799
If you talk to a fanatic, who is an ardent
Muslim and an ardent Hindu – they hate each

33:46.799 --> 33:47.820
other!

33:47.820 --> 33:52.249
They cannot understand how God could create
them, the one Person can create both of them.

33:52.249 --> 33:53.919
They think they have separate Gods!

33:53.919 --> 34:00.970
I don’t know how they carry on with their
fanaticism because I can’t understand.

34:00.970 --> 34:08.290
But the entire truth about everything can
be known through your vibratory awareness!

34:08.290 --> 34:18.850
And this vibratory awareness comes to you
through your attention which is enlightened

34:18.850 --> 34:19.850
by your Spirit.

34:19.850 --> 34:21.230
This Spirit resides within us.

34:21.230 --> 34:24.260
All the time it knows everything what we do.

34:24.260 --> 34:29.760
It’s the one which knows all our feelings,
wherever we move.

34:29.760 --> 34:37.110
But the same Spirit, when it enlightens our
attention, the thing that He’s enjoying,

34:37.110 --> 34:43.669
itself, or it is enjoying itself, becomes
our experience.

34:43.669 --> 34:48.830
Because the Spirit is collectively conscious
and we become collectively conscious.

34:48.830 --> 34:57.410
Those people who are not collectively conscious
are not Sahaj Yogis, they are absolutely just

34:57.410 --> 34:58.410
‘so-called’.

34:58.410 --> 35:06.280
First collective consciousness comes in, within
us, by feeling the cool breeze blowing through

35:06.280 --> 35:12.220
our hands and by feeling all the fingers and
feeling all the chakras.

35:12.220 --> 35:15.640
Some people don’t feel it in the hands if
their Vishuddhi is not alright, but still

35:15.640 --> 35:17.570
they can feel within themselves.

35:17.570 --> 35:24.480
Like there are devices I feel, as, if the
gas fails, then the electricity works out!

35:24.480 --> 35:27.100
That also works out in many people.

35:27.100 --> 35:31.680
You can feel it within yourself, where is
the problem and you can feel the chakras.

35:31.680 --> 35:40.040
That’s the first thing happens to you, that
you feel the collectivity within you.

35:40.040 --> 35:43.360
That you are a collective being you feel.

35:43.360 --> 35:49.600
You also feel about yourself, what you are
catching, where you are catching.

35:49.600 --> 35:59.780
And ultimately, then, you start feeling, nourishing
your collectivity.

35:59.780 --> 36:04.420
Which is the point very much missed in the
individualistic society.

36:04.420 --> 36:12.090
Because the whole of the individualistic society
is based on competition and there is no competition

36:12.090 --> 36:13.180
in Sahaj Yoga.

36:13.180 --> 36:15.340
It’s just the other way round.

36:15.340 --> 36:19.710
That you nourish on other people.

36:19.710 --> 36:24.930
The person who cannot carry on with other
Sahaj Yogis is a sure and certain person who

36:24.930 --> 36:26.850
is going to get out of this.

36:26.850 --> 36:34.160
You have to nourish yourself on collectivity.

36:34.160 --> 36:40.050
And once you start doing it, somehow or other,
you see, I have seen some people, it clicks

36:40.050 --> 36:41.230
with them, sometimes.

36:41.230 --> 36:45.570
But with some people I go on telling them,
“This way, that way” in so many ways I

36:45.570 --> 36:47.970
try to work it out, it never clicks.

36:47.970 --> 36:50.690
But with some people it suddenly clicks and
they become different people.

36:50.690 --> 36:53.314
Everybody then certifies, “Oh, they have
become very sweet now."

36:53.314 --> 37:01.190
But some of the people just go on, just like,
all the time they are like thorns, and anybody

37:01.190 --> 37:05.430
they touch, that person gets a fright.

37:05.430 --> 37:06.430
And then that person says, “Alright, I am
getting out.

37:06.430 --> 37:10.400
I am not talking to anyone, I am not doing
this.

37:10.400 --> 37:12.910
I am just keeping quiet."

37:12.910 --> 37:14.600
That’s all they can do.

37:14.600 --> 37:20.120
They cannot take out that thorn from themselves
and can become one, articulate with others.

37:20.120 --> 37:27.630
And when this thing happens, one has to know
that there’s something wrong.

37:27.630 --> 37:32.560
After all, from where are you going to get
your nourishment?

37:32.560 --> 37:40.730
The Spirit is shining, the sun is shining,
but your tree of life has to get your nourishment

37:40.730 --> 37:42.520
from collectivity.

37:42.520 --> 37:45.190
Once you realise that, it works wonders.

37:45.190 --> 37:53.960
It has worked wonders with so many people
all over the world.

37:53.960 --> 38:00.570
But there’s a greater danger for people,
where individualism is regarded as something

38:00.570 --> 38:08.630
great, where people think to be individualistic
in their attitude towards their selections

38:08.630 --> 38:13.780
and choices and the decision-making.

38:13.780 --> 38:21.950
For every small thing they will make a decision.

38:21.950 --> 38:22.950
Why?

38:22.950 --> 38:26.530
What is the advantage?

38:26.530 --> 38:29.960
What did you gain by wasting so much energy
in decision-making?

38:29.960 --> 38:35.310
Whether you’ll have the fish and chips or
you’ll have hamburger!

38:35.310 --> 38:37.460
What does it mean?

38:37.460 --> 38:39.080
Why waste so much energy on that?

38:39.080 --> 38:45.770
Where is your attention?

38:45.770 --> 38:54.140
All these things, all this attitude is nothing
but ego-oriented and is competitive.

38:54.140 --> 39:02.530
And also all the medias that are used are
just trying to exploit it.

39:02.530 --> 39:07.120
Like they’ll say “If you have a cigar
it’s sufficient, you need not have a Rolls-Royce,”

39:07.120 --> 39:09.280
or something like that.

39:09.280 --> 39:13.970
So you buy a cigar like a madcap.

39:13.970 --> 39:18.760
But if they put it in the television then
fifty percent [of] people will do it, as if

39:18.760 --> 39:21.570
they have no brains to use.

39:21.570 --> 39:26.310
It’s a mad world that way.

39:26.310 --> 39:36.930
But it is not, in a way, because you are seekers.

39:36.930 --> 39:39.170
Have you ever seen so many seekers?

39:39.170 --> 39:43.720
Seekers of Truth.

39:43.720 --> 39:48.230
They are not only claiming, they mean it.

39:48.230 --> 39:49.540
I know, they mean it.

39:49.540 --> 39:51.190
They are not just claiming.

39:51.190 --> 39:54.480
It’s not a fashion with them, they do mean
it.

39:54.480 --> 40:06.690
And I am really very happy about it that there
are seekers, those who are seeking, who are

40:06.690 --> 40:13.800
honest and intelligent and who want to know
who they are.

40:13.800 --> 40:17.660
Today, as I said, we’ll have a short programme.

40:17.660 --> 40:20.810
And there’s no end to my speeches.

40:20.810 --> 40:29.550
I don’t know how many speeches I have given
now, I’ve lost count!

40:29.550 --> 40:38.810
This is only just to make your attention a
little steady – then the Kundalini rises.

40:38.810 --> 40:45.000
Without that happening your attention cannot
go inside.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.890
Once the happening takes place your attention
is pulled in.

40:48.890 --> 40:56.870
The whole attention goes inside and it is
carried and is brought to this point where

40:56.870 --> 40:58.220
it breaks.

40:58.220 --> 41:03.090
This is the seat of your Spirit (on the Sahastrar),
while the seat (Spirit) resides in your heart.

41:03.090 --> 41:05.150
And you are blessed with your Self-realisation.

41:05.150 --> 41:13.020
Now, the growth has to come, that you have
to move your awareness towards the Spirit.

41:13.020 --> 41:21.250
And when that happens, that your Spirit dominates
your awareness, that your awareness becomes

41:21.250 --> 41:23.820
the Spirit, then Satchitananda [begins].

41:23.820 --> 41:29.870
‘Sat’ is the essence of your awareness,
is the Truth; through your awareness you know

41:29.870 --> 41:30.870
the truth.

41:30.870 --> 41:39.760
‘Chit’ is the attention and ‘anand’
is the Spirit.

41:39.760 --> 41:46.730
The essence of the Spirit is joy.

41:46.730 --> 41:50.570
All these things become one.

41:50.570 --> 41:54.240
That has to happen.

41:54.240 --> 41:56.040
Then the growth is much faster.

41:56.040 --> 42:01.420
When it is half way round, the growth is less.

42:01.420 --> 42:14.510
And the growth is to be felt in your collectivity
not in how you organise some things and all

42:14.510 --> 42:15.510
that – no!

42:15.510 --> 42:16.510
In collectivity.

42:16.510 --> 42:21.160
How you feel about the whole world, how you
are connected about the whole world.

42:21.160 --> 42:22.730
What you are doing about it.

42:22.730 --> 42:24.650
Can you work it out for them?

42:24.650 --> 42:25.730
Where is your attention?

42:25.730 --> 42:26.730
– Again.

42:26.730 --> 42:32.530
As soon as you go on your Spirit you will
start worrying about the whole universe.

42:32.530 --> 42:34.180
It will happen.

42:34.180 --> 42:36.380
The priorities will change.

42:36.380 --> 42:38.320
“Oh, I am here, I am the Spirit.

42:38.320 --> 42:39.470
And my work is not this.

42:39.470 --> 42:42.870
This is useless, this is not meant for me."

42:42.870 --> 42:51.160
And the attention will start going from all
mundane, gross things to the spiritual side.

42:51.160 --> 42:55.740
But by going there you become so dynamic that
all material things will work out just like

42:55.740 --> 42:56.740
that.

42:56.740 --> 43:00.021
(Shri Mataji clicks Her fingers) You’ll
have no problem with material things, they

43:00.021 --> 43:01.021
will work out.

43:01.021 --> 43:11.820
I’ll tell you that a few examples are like
this: You know I am a married woman and I

43:11.820 --> 43:12.820
have got grandchildren.

43:12.820 --> 43:17.670
I run my house very well and I have a household
and mine is a marathon race!

43:17.670 --> 43:21.520
I mean, all of you have a relay-race but I
have a marathon one.

43:21.520 --> 43:23.460
And it works out.

43:23.460 --> 43:27.680
But apart from that so many problems are solved.

43:27.680 --> 43:30.400
I’ll give you a simple example.

43:30.400 --> 43:33.380
Some girls have come from Australia.

43:33.380 --> 43:38.010
They told me, related, many problems they
have solved.

43:38.010 --> 43:43.730
But one of them was very sweet that, there
was a lady: she very much wanted to come to

43:43.730 --> 43:48.170
India to see me, and she thought her money
was not sufficient.

43:48.170 --> 43:51.830
Now, money is absolutely material.

43:51.830 --> 43:57.190
And the little child, daughter she had, she
also wanted to come.

43:57.190 --> 44:00.440
And the girl was having a jumble-sale, something.

44:00.440 --> 44:05.319
So she collected some of the trinkets here
and there and went for a jumble-sale.

44:05.319 --> 44:12.070
And they discovered that she had a very expensive
bracelet of gold, suddenly, which sold out

44:12.070 --> 44:23.220
for the amount of money exactly required for
the ticket of the mother and the child.

44:23.220 --> 44:24.860
Exactly!

44:24.860 --> 44:28.850
Oh, this is nothing.

44:28.850 --> 44:32.480
There are many people who have known how materially
it works out.

44:32.480 --> 44:38.330
For example we have a doctor of physics here
(Regis), who was doing his doctorate and he

44:38.330 --> 44:43.590
did it for years and years, I don’t remember
exactly how many years.

44:43.590 --> 44:48.030
And he brought his papers to me, he said,
“Mother, I cannot now have anything more

44:48.030 --> 44:59.500
done, now I cannot even make it a fair thing.

44:59.500 --> 45:12.300
I cannot put it in the bound.

45:12.300 --> 45:20.030
And this is how I’m going to now present
it.

45:20.030 --> 45:21.880
I am fed up.

45:21.880 --> 45:26.510
I have finished every single pie (1/192 Rupee)
I had."

45:26.510 --> 45:27.900
I said, “Alright."

45:27.900 --> 45:32.200
I just did like this to the thing (gave a
bandhan).

45:32.200 --> 45:34.580
He said, “Are You not going to read?”

45:34.580 --> 45:38.180
I said, “No, what is there to read?

45:38.180 --> 45:39.180
It’s alright."

45:39.180 --> 45:40.180
You won’t believe – he went next day to
see the gentleman and he became a doctor of

45:40.180 --> 45:41.180
physics!

45:41.180 --> 45:42.180
That’s how materially things work out.

45:42.180 --> 45:43.180
Krishna has said it, “Yoga kshema vahamyaham."

45:43.180 --> 45:44.180
Yoga, when you get your yoga, when you are
connected with God, then He looks after you:

45:44.180 --> 45:45.180
kshema – your well-being.

45:45.180 --> 45:47.350
This is so simple to understand.

45:47.350 --> 45:53.460
There’s another very simple truth one should
understand that, if we are not connected with

45:53.460 --> 45:56.310
Him, how can He look after us?

45:56.310 --> 45:59.630
We have to be connected with Him: so we know
His desires, we know His ways, we know how

45:59.630 --> 46:05.980
to please Him, we know what to do and so we
can ask for what we want.

46:05.980 --> 46:08.140
You don’t even have to ask!

46:08.140 --> 46:14.680
You’ll be surprised how things work out
for you: how family relations improve, social

46:14.680 --> 46:16.280
relations improve, economic relations improve.

46:16.280 --> 46:19.120
All these things are on your centres.

46:19.120 --> 46:24.700
And as the Kundalini rises She starts spreading
sideways also and you start getting the effect.

46:24.700 --> 46:31.930
The first you get is the material and the
physical, and that’s how you know how we

46:31.930 --> 46:36.120
have cured people of cancer and things, just
like that!

46:36.120 --> 46:38.220
(Shri Mataji snaps Her fingers)

46:38.220 --> 46:44.720
People don’t understand how we have done
it but we have.

46:44.720 --> 46:49.980
Because Spirit is the dynamism within us,
it is the thing.

46:49.980 --> 47:04.030
Like one diamond which is put in a ring and
embedded in the soil, saved permanently, just

47:04.030 --> 47:10.870
to keep it out of problems, is suddenly discovered.

47:10.870 --> 47:13.000
And that’s why it is all we seek.

47:13.000 --> 47:17.620
The basis of all our existence is nothing
but our Spirit.

47:17.620 --> 47:23.500
That’s the basis, that’s the adhara, that’s
the support.

47:23.500 --> 47:36.140
And to us it should be a special blessing
for our Lord, Jesus Christ, was the embodiment

47:36.140 --> 47:37.280
of that Spirit.

47:37.280 --> 47:41.110
He came on this earth just to show you the
way of your resurrection.

47:41.110 --> 47:44.190
It’s a special blessing to us.

47:44.190 --> 47:49.830
But Him also we have made it into a fanatic
stuff.

47:49.830 --> 47:51.890
We are ‘great’ people!

47:51.890 --> 47:57.780
Give anything to human beings and they know
how to make a good mess out of it!

47:57.780 --> 47:59.740
That’s what I have discovered.

47:59.740 --> 48:08.990
He was crucified: that was alright, because
He cannot be crucified, He cannot be killed,

48:08.990 --> 48:09.990
that I know.

48:09.990 --> 48:16.380
But the way now He is clouded and how He is
plucked out of reality and put into something

48:16.380 --> 48:20.120
false – sometimes it’s so shocking, frustrating
and so humiliating that you can’t imagine.

48:20.120 --> 48:21.120
Whatever done is done.

48:21.120 --> 48:24.470
The quality of Spirit is forgiveness.

48:24.470 --> 48:27.830
The symbol of Spirit is Christ.

48:27.830 --> 48:42.350
And the power He has given us to forgive,
because He has that power to forgive.

48:42.350 --> 48:48.680
He’s the power of forgiveness.

48:48.680 --> 48:53.610
He is the ocean of forgiveness.

48:53.610 --> 49:01.550
So, He’s so powerful that He cleanses you
through forgiveness.

49:01.550 --> 49:04.460
Just by forgiving you He cleanses you.

49:04.460 --> 49:08.430
And that’s how it works out.

49:08.430 --> 49:16.040
So you should not try to build a guilt in
your mind.

49:16.040 --> 49:20.220
That’s the only thing most of the Christians
do, is to sit down and build a guilt by spoiling

49:20.220 --> 49:21.220
this part of the chakra here.

49:21.220 --> 49:29.030
It’s amazing how it has
come to us, this guilt.

49:29.030 --> 49:36.580
Perhaps the psychologists or confessions,
I don’t know what it has been.

49:36.580 --> 49:39.930
They are guilty in imagination.

49:39.930 --> 49:42.800
And that part is very sad.

49:42.800 --> 49:43.800
That does not help.

49:43.800 --> 49:46.690
You are not to be guilty.

49:46.690 --> 49:48.030
You are the Spirit.

49:48.030 --> 49:51.170
What crime Spirit can do?

49:51.170 --> 49:52.170
Nothing!

49:52.170 --> 49:54.830
Only you have to get out of it, to become
that.

49:54.830 --> 49:57.010
That’s what we are going to have.

49:57.010 --> 49:58.010
And let us work it out.

49:58.010 --> 50:00.470
We have some new people over here.

50:00.470 --> 50:04.580
I am sure it is going to work out.

50:04.580 --> 50:11.780
But for all the new people now, I have to
say one thing, that Sahaj Yoga is not a thing

50:11.780 --> 50:13.620
you just go for a programme and get out.

50:13.620 --> 50:14.620
It’s dangerous to do that.

50:14.620 --> 50:15.620
If you get your Realisation and still you
do not recognise Sahaj Yoga it will be very

50:15.620 --> 50:18.020
difficult for you to come back to Sahaj Yoga.

50:18.020 --> 50:21.170
So, please understand that, if you have found
the way, do not lose it.

50:21.170 --> 50:22.170
Try to follow it.

50:22.170 --> 50:23.170
I have nothing to gain from you.

50:23.170 --> 50:28.920
It is you who has to gain; that’s your right.

50:28.920 --> 50:30.910
You better have it.

50:30.910 --> 50:38.370
May God bless you all.

50:38.370 --> 50:40.960
About these chakras and all that: we’ve
got some papers, which you can see yourself

50:40.960 --> 50:42.860
and read and you can understand.

50:42.860 --> 50:44.370
Is there?

50:44.370 --> 50:51.049
So, let us, put your hands like this and we’ll
work it out.
