00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:17.423
Today we have gathered here to do the puja of the Devi

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.630
The Devi has many forms but

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.816
is the embodiment of the shakti.

00:00:32.896 --> 00:00:40.870
Adishakti gives shakti to all these embodiments.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.790
And so there are many Goddesses we have at different times.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.140
They came on this earth and did

00:00:52.220 --> 00:01:00.350
all that was necessary for the
ascent of people who were seekers.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:10.150
Specially the one we know of Jagadamba, the Durga.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:18.676
She was trying to protect all the seekers of truth

00:01:18.756 --> 00:01:23.545
and to destroy all evil forces.

00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:35.065
But in the modern times, materialism retards that hankering,

00:01:35.145 --> 00:01:42.825
that dedication. It's maddening
for people when they are seekers.

00:01:44.865 --> 00:01:52.434
I have seen before coming to Sahaja
Yoga, people spend lot of money,

00:01:52.514 --> 00:02:00.105
go to various places, go to
Himalayas, go to Nepal, go to Japan,

00:02:00.185 --> 00:02:04.615
all over the places they are moving.

00:02:04.695 --> 00:02:07.865
But after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:02:07.945 --> 00:02:11.902
after they have become the spirits,

00:02:11.982 --> 00:02:17.866
for the growth of your new awareness

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:22.145
the progress is retarded.

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:27.785
Also one should understand
that after so much of running about,

00:02:27.865 --> 00:02:32.425
you find something so precious so you settle down with that.

00:02:32.505 --> 00:02:36.985
And you feel very satisfied
about it. That part is all right.

00:02:37.065 --> 00:02:42.705
But what later? Your growth should not stop.

00:02:44.905 --> 00:02:47.665
And that stops because,

00:02:47.745 --> 00:02:52.105
because of one of the main reasons is materialism.

00:02:54.945 --> 00:02:56.945
Because of materialism,

00:02:57.025 --> 00:03:01.985
your faith in yourself is also less.

00:03:02.065 --> 00:03:07.625
Now as you have seen that the Gods prayed to the Goddess

00:03:07.705 --> 00:03:13.017
and She came and killed all the negative forces.

00:03:14.465 --> 00:03:20.345
Reason was: the earnest desire of the Gods

00:03:21.385 --> 00:03:25.465
compelled Her to take incarnation.

00:03:25.545 --> 00:03:29.865
Such sincere desire

00:03:29.945 --> 00:03:37.945
that they could not get sometimes food, even water,

00:03:38.025 --> 00:03:44.465
and they worked so hard for their ascent

00:03:44.545 --> 00:03:48.265
which was disturbed by negative forces.

00:03:49.545 --> 00:03:57.618
So their call was so from the heart,

00:03:57.698 --> 00:04:02.362
so desperate and genuine and sincere

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:07.985
that the Goddess had to take birth on this earth

00:04:08.065 --> 00:04:15.275
to save them, to protect them, to look after them.

00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:21.726
Now so we come to Sahaja Yoga in this modern time.

00:04:21.806 --> 00:04:31.206
Sometimes I feel that not only Sahaja Yoga is very easy

00:04:31.286 --> 00:04:40.526
also it is extremely pampering.
You know you have got Realization.

00:04:40.606 --> 00:04:45.311
You all know that you are better than others,

00:04:45.391 --> 00:04:47.807
that you have got rid of so many problems

00:04:47.887 --> 00:04:51.646
and that now you have become master of your own.

00:04:51.726 --> 00:04:57.966
Then the responsibility

00:04:59.526 --> 00:05:07.886
that you have towards yourself
and to your fellow men reduces

00:05:07.966 --> 00:05:11.675
because you feel very satisfied with yourself.

00:05:11.755 --> 00:05:14.915
But it is to be seen now

00:05:14.995 --> 00:05:21.675
that if you do not value yourself as realized souls,

00:05:21.755 --> 00:05:24.915
you can not value My time also

00:05:24.995 --> 00:05:29.835
or what is Myself.

00:05:29.915 --> 00:05:34.595
This incarnation can be wasted completely

00:05:34.675 --> 00:05:39.595
because of this materialistic attitude.

00:05:42.315 --> 00:05:45.435
In this modern times, I don't know

00:05:45.515 --> 00:05:48.155
what's gone wrong with human beings

00:05:48.235 --> 00:05:53.355
because the most important thing in your life

00:05:53.435 --> 00:05:56.715
is to ascend and to grow.

00:05:56.795 --> 00:06:00.715
Take a big vision of the whole thing.

00:06:00.795 --> 00:06:04.835
Why this universe was created?

00:06:04.915 --> 00:06:10.115
Why you were created as human beings?

00:06:10.195 --> 00:06:15.275
What was the need to do all
these things? For what is it done?

00:06:15.355 --> 00:06:19.475
If you have a very big vision of the whole thing

00:06:19.555 --> 00:06:23.235
then try to locate your position: "Where am I?!

00:06:23.315 --> 00:06:26.515
And then, "How the Divine has selected me

00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:30.075
and now I have become a Sahaja yogi?"

00:06:32.315 --> 00:06:35.587
So now, "What is my responsibility?"

00:06:35.667 --> 00:06:38.896
that one has to see.

00:06:38.976 --> 00:06:45.536
The perspective we can see: the Goddess.

00:06:45.616 --> 00:06:48.376
She comes on this earth

00:06:48.456 --> 00:06:52.536
in different forms at different times

00:06:52.616 --> 00:06:57.136
to save the seekers of truth

00:06:57.216 --> 00:07:02.576
and to work out the ascent of the seekers of truth.

00:07:02.656 --> 00:07:05.336
Can you imagine?

00:07:05.416 --> 00:07:09.576
A very big difference in the incarnation

00:07:09.656 --> 00:07:15.976
of the Goddess before Kaliyuga.

00:07:16.056 --> 00:07:21.536
While now, it's a very different thing

00:07:21.616 --> 00:07:24.496
that you have come on this earth

00:07:24.576 --> 00:07:28.536
to become the Sahaja yogis.

00:07:28.616 --> 00:07:33.336
You have to have a body, a mind,

00:07:33.416 --> 00:07:39.016
feeling everything which is just charged with spirituality,

00:07:39.096 --> 00:07:41.183
charged with your spirituality.

00:07:41.263 --> 00:07:43.623
Now what you have to do is to

00:07:43.703 --> 00:07:49.463
cross the limits of materialism, this nonsensical

00:07:49.543 --> 00:07:54.183
dwarfy force that is working on you

00:07:54.263 --> 00:08:02.143
and you have to transcend and bring, as I said, gold

00:08:02.223 --> 00:08:10.383
that is untarnishable thing from the borders of Sahaja yoga.

00:08:12.583 --> 00:08:18.583
How many of you really are in the field of work?

00:08:18.663 --> 00:08:22.303
How many of you are telling about this to people?

00:08:23.983 --> 00:08:26.903
What are you doing about it?

00:08:33.583 --> 00:08:39.743
Why I am talking to you and not to Indians this way

00:08:39.823 --> 00:08:45.103
because their attitude is different.

00:08:45.183 --> 00:08:49.783
Their attitude is not materialistic. It's spiritual.

00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:53.023
They want their spiritual ascent

00:08:53.103 --> 00:08:58.863
for which they suffer a lot. They
go out of the way to do things

00:08:58.943 --> 00:09:08.583
just to get to that state where
they could be easily surrendered.

00:09:08.663 --> 00:09:11.771
This surrender state has to come.

00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:15.775
Try to understand. You are here for becoming the spirit

00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:23.035
and then to spread the light of the spirit. Nothing matters.

00:09:24.059 --> 00:09:27.671
Once you start doing that, you'll be amazed:

00:09:27.751 --> 00:09:33.898
the faith works. It's not blind faith. It's not blind faith.

00:09:33.978 --> 00:09:39.473
You don't have to tell Me even. It just works.

00:09:47.486 --> 00:09:57.609
It's a matter a few days, you might get many results

00:09:57.689 --> 00:10:03.458
of what you have been hankering after, material,

00:10:03.538 --> 00:10:09.458
superficials, you might get. But the question remains.

00:10:11.814 --> 00:10:19.679
Somebody, say, wants to dedicate his life, so called,

00:10:19.759 --> 00:10:24.169
for Sahaja Yoga. Then what do you do?

00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:27.891
What do you do if you dedicate?

00:10:27.971 --> 00:10:32.089
First thing is your faith.

00:10:32.169 --> 00:10:37.768
You must know: how is your faith into anything.

00:10:37.848 --> 00:10:43.337
You really believe in it or you
do not? If you do believe in it,

00:10:43.417 --> 00:10:46.134
what have you done about it?

00:10:49.167 --> 00:10:56.718
So at this stage, you have to introspect.

00:10:56.798 --> 00:10:58.915
What are you doing?

00:10:58.995 --> 00:11:03.637
What are we to do? How far do we have to go?

00:11:03.717 --> 00:11:08.140
It's a very, very important time

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:14.957
and you are extremely important souls here sitting down

00:11:15.037 --> 00:11:22.461
but, if you don't value your own systems and yourself,

00:11:22.541 --> 00:11:25.741
why should God worry about you?

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.979
Why should God try to give you ideas?

00:11:32.059 --> 00:11:36.748
Why should He try to take any interest even in you

00:11:36.828 --> 00:11:39.007
persons of that [kind].

00:11:39.087 --> 00:11:42.213
But your faith in yourself is very weak.

00:11:42.293 --> 00:11:45.675
I think that's the main reason for all this fall

00:11:45.755 --> 00:11:48.286
is faith in yourself.

00:11:49.889 --> 00:12:05.640
This faith is such a thing that you know it is.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.918
You have seen My photographs.

00:12:08.998 --> 00:12:12.977
You are convinced about it. There is nothing to be convinced

00:12:13.057 --> 00:12:16.961
but this faith is not one with your heart.

00:12:17.041 --> 00:12:24.319
It is not just with your being. It's outside.

00:12:24.399 --> 00:12:29.244
All right, Mother will do that. Mother
will solve this. Mother will do this.

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:38.817
But, whole thing is now

00:12:38.897 --> 00:12:45.495
to Me looks like, that I have to compulsorily tell you

00:12:45.575 --> 00:12:48.734
to do some sort of a tapasya.

00:12:50.964 --> 00:12:59.713
You ask somebody, "Do you
meditate?" "No Mother," very plainly.

00:12:59.793 --> 00:13:05.529
"No Mother, we don't." "So, what are you doing here?" "My,

00:13:05.609 --> 00:13:11.264
My... there is some pain in my knees so I have come to you."

00:13:11.344 --> 00:13:14.181
All right. "But I don't meditate. I am very honest.

00:13:14.261 --> 00:13:16.870
I don't meditate.

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:20.014
I just have some pain in the knees. Please cure it.

00:13:20.094 --> 00:13:22.319
I don't meditate."

00:13:24.486 --> 00:13:29.702
How many of you really meditate every night?

00:13:30.792 --> 00:13:34.064
Guido said that, "Mother, if
You tell like this they will say,

00:13:34.145 --> 00:13:37.369
'All right in the night we do but not in the morning'

00:13:37.449 --> 00:13:40.160
because Mother has said, 'Do it in the night.'"

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:44.638
So many people mentally very
well equipped in Sahaja Yoga, I know.

00:13:44.718 --> 00:13:48.716
But as far as the following of Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

00:13:48.796 --> 00:13:51.702
they are not there.

00:13:51.782 --> 00:13:54.599
So I am warning you now.

00:13:54.679 --> 00:13:58.430
It's like Christ has said, "some seeds which are sprouted

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:02.469
fell on the street, dried out and died."

00:14:02.549 --> 00:14:05.141
Now the judgment is going on all the time.

00:14:05.221 --> 00:14:09.824
When I am talking to you, it's all the judgment is going on.

00:14:09.904 --> 00:14:14.041
So every night you have to meditate.

00:14:14.121 --> 00:14:21.517
And you have to then think about
what have you done tonight, today,

00:14:21.597 --> 00:14:24.622
in the whole day what have you achieved.

00:14:24.702 --> 00:14:30.361
My job is to cleanse myself up and know myself.

00:14:30.441 --> 00:14:33.873
This is my work, my job, and this is what I have to do.

00:14:33.953 --> 00:14:38.393
I am not bothered if I get admission in the school or not.

00:14:38.473 --> 00:14:42.150
I am not bothered if somebody has to go by plane,

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:45.117
so he gets a ticket or not.

00:14:45.197 --> 00:14:47.199
You just won't believe

00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:49.542
that you show your faith in yourself,

00:14:49.622 --> 00:14:53.865
you'll get the admission, you'll get the ticket,

00:14:53.945 --> 00:14:59.042
whatever you want it's there. It's all there.

00:14:59.122 --> 00:15:02.245
You don't have to strive for it.

00:15:02.325 --> 00:15:06.986
You don't have to bother for it. It's just there.

00:15:08.065 --> 00:15:11.946
It is. I mean, all My life it has been happening.

00:15:12.026 --> 00:15:18.504
Of course My faith is like
solid, like Gibraltar, no question.

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:22.508
Because I know what I am and I
know what I am supposed to do.

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:25.932
So My, for Me I have no problem.

00:15:26.012 --> 00:15:28.916
All the faith and I know everyone

00:15:28.996 --> 00:15:33.598
and I can say that I can make out a flying bird.

00:15:35.209 --> 00:15:38.754
May not show that. Sometimes I may say that, all right

00:15:38.834 --> 00:15:41.842
this is good, this is that, but I know for definite

00:15:41.922 --> 00:15:45.326
what I am and what I have to do.

00:15:45.406 --> 00:15:48.842
In the same way, you have to know about yourself

00:15:48.922 --> 00:15:52.248
because it is a different category of people you are.

00:15:52.328 --> 00:15:55.477
You are not the ones who need protection from God,

00:15:55.557 --> 00:16:00.880
who need protection from the Mother, no.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.317
You have to give protections to others.

00:16:04.397 --> 00:16:06.990
It is you have to give light to others.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:09.932
You have to show them the path.

00:16:10.012 --> 00:16:17.159
So one has to change one's own language, the style.

00:16:17.239 --> 00:16:25.071
And our understanding should be that we are a rough people.

00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:29.264
We are rough as far as ourselves are concerned.

00:16:29.344 --> 00:16:33.861
With others we are kind, tender, and sweet.

00:16:33.941 --> 00:16:38.449
But as far as we are concerned, we are not.

00:16:38.529 --> 00:16:42.221
Once it happened, we had a transfer

00:16:42.301 --> 00:16:45.424
and we went into a house, very big house though,

00:16:45.504 --> 00:16:48.706
but there was nothing to sleep upon. There was one bed,

00:16:48.786 --> 00:16:52.546
very small. My husband was
sleeping. He just can't do like that.

00:16:52.626 --> 00:16:55.682
I said, "All right, take a
challenge." I slept on the ground.

00:16:55.762 --> 00:16:58.926
Next day, I had pain in the body.

00:16:59.006 --> 00:17:05.556
I told My body, "Behave yourself. You
must learn how to sleep on stones also."

00:17:05.636 --> 00:17:10.684
And for one month I was sleeping on the ground, still.

00:17:10.764 --> 00:17:13.143
So you have to be harsh with your body.

00:17:13.223 --> 00:17:16.945
You have to be harsh with your mind which gives you ideas

00:17:17.025 --> 00:17:22.206
of materialism or of retarding
your progress in spirituality.

00:17:22.286 --> 00:17:25.929
Now, escapes, escapes they find out.

00:17:27.694 --> 00:17:35.375
So we are at a crossing roads where we have to understand

00:17:35.455 --> 00:17:40.818
who will go higher and who will go lower.

00:17:40.898 --> 00:17:43.342
You have to find out who is the one

00:17:43.422 --> 00:17:45.945
who is going to achieve something

00:17:46.025 --> 00:17:49.865
and where am I compared to that person.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:54.618
It's said, "You have to suffer. You have to do this.

00:17:54.698 --> 00:17:58.403
You have to do that." Nothing of the kind, by God's grace.

00:17:58.483 --> 00:18:00.945
Nothing of that kind.

00:18:03.516 --> 00:18:10.882
So now what is it? What will happen to a Sahaja yogi?

00:18:10.962 --> 00:18:16.180
How will you know who is a Sahaja yogi?

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:23.777
How will you know who is just putting a lip service?

00:18:23.857 --> 00:18:27.041
Only way is that you evolve.

00:18:27.121 --> 00:18:29.722
You become like a mirror

00:18:29.802 --> 00:18:34.962
and you see for yourself what sort of a person he is

00:18:35.042 --> 00:18:40.599
and also you see yourself, what you are.

00:18:40.679 --> 00:18:45.117
Today's lecture is more, sort of,

00:18:45.197 --> 00:18:49.082
is actually absolutely inspired lecture.

00:18:49.162 --> 00:18:52.518
And it is the one that should tell you

00:18:52.598 --> 00:18:57.350
that all that we have done today

00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:06.095
is this to understand our own values about our own life.

00:19:06.175 --> 00:19:09.856
We should understand: "Why are we on this earth?

00:19:09.936 --> 00:19:15.544
What is our purpose and what you have to achieve?"

00:19:16.679 --> 00:19:23.382
See, this I give you My all blessings from My heart.

00:19:23.462 --> 00:19:29.519
And I want you to accept My blessings,

00:19:31.169 --> 00:19:39.717
to be the great lights of God's desire.

00:19:39.797 --> 00:19:45.258
Try to understand what important time you are born

00:19:45.338 --> 00:19:54.616
and that you have become such good, beautiful people of God.

00:19:54.696 --> 00:19:56.815
May God bless you!
