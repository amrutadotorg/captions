WEBVTT

00:01.920 --> 00:03.800
But they don't know cooking they said.

00:05.840 --> 00:09.520
They know a little bit. They had to know a little bit of it.

00:09.720 --> 00:11.240
Does he know you are his side?

00:11.520 --> 00:13.080
Yes, yes, he knows.

00:13.400 --> 00:19.480
Then that really is very, very, they are very much playing there.

00:23.640 --> 00:25.920
Yes, she's saying you something.

00:28.360 --> 00:30.680
We should not show that we are paying attention to her,

00:30.880 --> 00:34.120
otherwise becomes self conscious.

00:42.560 --> 00:44.640
You can think that that completes to them,

00:44.920 --> 00:46.840
that they have everything there.

01:19.520 --> 01:23.600
Then I saw Portugal is like that, I felt maybe the

01:24.200 --> 01:29.160
over-industrialized countries may become like that only.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.240
All are like this Mother.

01:39.520 --> 01:43.560
You see, this unemployement, and these are not very good signs for any country.

01:45.680 --> 01:47.120
That's how it starts.

01:48.560 --> 01:53.040
It started the same way in Portugal. People got unemployed,

01:55.800 --> 01:58.160
and they've got out of their country.

02:00.280 --> 02:07.960
Now out of the, I don't know, six million people in Portugal

02:08.280 --> 02:11.120
there's only one million people they only think about, left.

02:12.560 --> 02:15.360
All the rest are out.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.520
And the proportion is much more I think.

02:17.840 --> 02:23.680
In Brasilia, in Sao Paolo or Brasilia, that is a city from Brasil

02:24.120 --> 02:26.840
there are more Portugese than in our whole country.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.880
That's it.

02:29.160 --> 02:34.240
Mother, in Portugal and France too, they don't want Portugese anymore,

02:34.600 --> 02:38.440
and nobody wants Portugese. That reputation we have. Very bad.

02:39.040 --> 02:40.880
In France they hate, they hate us,

02:41.280 --> 02:45.640
and in Brasil they make jokes about Portugese people.

02:45.960 --> 02:51.560
They [don't like] us. Portugese people don't take care of us they say.

02:51.960 --> 02:52.560
Don't take?

02:52.800 --> 02:56.080
Don't take care of us when they were in France.

02:56.400 --> 03:00.320
Things like that.

03:00.520 --> 03:01.360
They say, Mother...

03:01.560 --> 03:02.080
Yeah?

03:02.280 --> 03:07.160
They say "what happens if we don't push ourselves" and want us to take,

03:07.480 --> 03:11.000
I'm not used to take baths but that they don't like it.

03:11.640 --> 03:12.640
French people say so?

03:12.840 --> 03:13.560
Yes, Mother.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.440
Do they take baths, French?

03:16.800 --> 03:18.320
No, I don't know.

03:18.680 --> 03:22.440
It's racialism Mother, just racialism.

03:23.800 --> 03:27.880
Portugese are much more clean thaan French are.

03:28.520 --> 03:29.640
What are they talking?

03:29.880 --> 03:30.720
I don't know.

03:31.040 --> 03:36.280
Horrible, they are digging it up.

03:37.200 --> 03:39.840
No morals, nothing. All bathrooms.

03:43.040 --> 03:44.880
That's why they are always perfumering.

03:51.040 --> 03:54.160
Now that they say that about Portugese. Sometimes I can't believe it.

04:03.560 --> 04:05.960
All racialism. It's very clear.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.960
That too are very concerned Indian people

04:17.440 --> 04:23.480
who are I mean really used to, say, take baths in India. That's true.

04:24.880 --> 04:29.240
They are very clean and, but otherwise everywhere,

04:30.040 --> 04:32.520
the whole of you are not. It's just the same.

04:32.720 --> 04:34.880
Worst is France, worst.

04:39.400 --> 04:45.200
A lady on the phone, Mother. She wanted the Harlem Globetrotters.

04:46.160 --> 04:49.400
She wanted to find out the Harlem Globetrotters Mother.

04:49.840 --> 04:53.400
They are an American basketball team

04:53.640 --> 04:56.760
and she saw this was the Brighton center.

04:57.960 --> 04:59.600
Only it's Sahaja Yoga center.

04:59.800 --> 05:00.160
Really?

05:00.360 --> 05:02.680
It isn't written.

05:02.880 --> 05:04.120
For the Globetrotters?

05:04.440 --> 05:05.560
Yes.

05:10.240 --> 05:12.400
You must put up a, then let's put a sign over there.

05:12.600 --> 05:13.080
Of course.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.400
You better put. You should really going to add.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.240
Though I'm not sure Mother because it's a rented accommodation,

05:18.440 --> 05:24.360
and I may get fined with adding it. But we are good teenants.

05:24.560 --> 05:25.480
You ask them.

05:25.800 --> 05:26.360
Yes, Mother.

05:26.560 --> 05:27.240
You ask the lady.

05:27.440 --> 05:28.120
Yes, Mother.

05:28.320 --> 05:30.280
If she agrees.

05:30.480 --> 05:31.520
Yes, Mother.

05:47.280 --> 05:58.080
[Hindi]

06:01.440 --> 06:02.960
Ha, where is the table now?

06:04.160 --> 06:05.280
Where is the table now?

06:19.960 --> 06:22.280
These are made in England you know. Not Italy.

06:44.960 --> 06:47.280
Ha, that's it, very heavy.

06:59.640 --> 07:03.440
They also illtreat Italians very much, in a way.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.640
Don't you think so, Pedro?

07:05.960 --> 07:07.080
Yes.

07:07.680 --> 07:11.800
These people... And even C.P. was telling Me that

07:12.920 --> 07:15.240
some were there in Norway and Sweden and

07:16.400 --> 07:22.400
they were given lower wages than the local people and...

07:23.560 --> 07:24.360
For Italians.

07:24.640 --> 07:25.200
Yeah.

07:25.520 --> 07:27.760
And you can't do under international laws.

07:28.480 --> 07:30.800
You have to give the same wages, you see.

07:31.240 --> 07:34.680
And there were some... May God bless you.

07:35.080 --> 07:38.240
Some underhand things, they used.

07:39.840 --> 07:40.960
So that is our racialism.

07:41.880 --> 07:44.480
Mother but in France they don't like Italians.

07:44.880 --> 07:50.800
In France they don't like Italians. They treat them very, you know...

07:51.000 --> 07:51.880
Even, even France?

07:52.080 --> 07:55.400
Yes, France don't like Italians.

07:55.680 --> 07:57.320
What do the French think of themselves?

07:57.520 --> 07:58.760
Oh, that they are the best.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.400
Are these types of French one must arrive?

08:07.800 --> 08:09.480
Well, their Roland is the best.

08:17.160 --> 08:18.280
It's very wrong then.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.040
You know when I heard I was surprised at.

08:24.920 --> 08:26.840
Even internationally it is accepted

08:27.720 --> 08:30.800
that we have to treat everyone the same way.

08:32.560 --> 08:36.440
But that's one point I must say about Americans really

08:37.480 --> 08:39.480
they don't have so much of racialism.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.760
They have only for blacks and whites but otherwise they don't have.

08:44.600 --> 08:47.680
Even blacks and whites it is not so much [uprised] we see it in England.

08:48.320 --> 08:52.040
Not so sharp. They have crossed that quite a lot.

08:52.520 --> 08:53.640
They are very cosmopolite.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.960
That's something creditable to them.

09:03.400 --> 09:06.840
In America you'll find so many races, all kind.

09:07.120 --> 09:09.160
Indians are treated very well.

09:09.720 --> 09:11.880
Not the way they are treated in England.

09:16.080 --> 09:20.920
Italians, also. So many Italians have shops. Yes.

09:21.920 --> 09:23.760
Now you make some tea for Me?

09:25.760 --> 09:27.840
Make some tea for Me.

09:32.320 --> 09:34.520
I think that some food will be for children.

09:36.360 --> 09:37.480
Good.

09:38.680 --> 09:40.560
He taught you. Press it.

09:57.680 --> 09:58.800
He's sturdy and good.

10:03.440 --> 10:06.760
But Italians are such craftsmen and such artists.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.760
What do they think of themselves? French.

10:12.080 --> 10:13.600
I don't know Mother.

10:14.360 --> 10:16.840
Maybe they are jealous, because

10:17.040 --> 10:20.120
Italians when they work they are very clever, with the hands and...

10:20.320 --> 10:23.880
With the hands, with art. And with paintings.

10:24.680 --> 10:30.480
Designing, for designing they are very good.

10:31.520 --> 10:34.400
The quality also of all these things, are very good quality.

10:34.600 --> 10:35.680
And even today it is good.

10:35.920 --> 10:37.200
Yes, yes.

10:38.200 --> 10:40.440
I don't know why, why French have this kind of a...

10:40.640 --> 10:42.880
Because they import by the, the Italian's fault is

10:43.080 --> 10:45.800
better achievements and the French just don't like it.

10:46.360 --> 10:47.560
That's it. Jealousy.

10:47.920 --> 10:49.040
Yeah.

10:49.240 --> 10:51.760
All, all salesmen in fact, they say "Oh, Italian products,

10:52.080 --> 10:53.480
they are fine products,

10:53.760 --> 10:56.120
we are going to trade with these because it's cheaper then".

10:56.320 --> 11:03.120
And the French you know don't like that because it wouldn't be good for their bussiness.

11:03.320 --> 11:05.960
Yes. Where is the cover?

11:10.240 --> 11:13.040
There's a little cover attached inside.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.880
How they are changed with little things you see.

11:20.600 --> 11:26.600
I wish human beings were like that, so simple.

11:40.200 --> 11:44.240
You see, our Prime Minister's daughter in law is an Italian girl.

11:44.520 --> 11:45.120
[Indira Gandhi's]?

11:45.320 --> 11:45.800
Did you hear?

11:45.999 --> 11:47.440
No I didn't know.

11:48.800 --> 11:53.960
And her husband, you see now, is [future Prime Minister].

11:54.160 --> 11:55.800
Indira Gandhi always thinks that

11:56.400 --> 11:59.200
she should make her children the Prime Ministers,

11:59.400 --> 12:01.160
thinks it's her father's property.

12:02.320 --> 12:05.800
So now she's trying to put him up as a Prime Minister.

12:06.800 --> 12:09.080
His wife is an Italian.

12:10.360 --> 12:12.800
Sonia, her name is Sonia.

12:15.760 --> 12:18.680
It's an Indian name, Sonia. I don't know what it means in Italy?

12:19.080 --> 12:20.920
No, it's a name. They also...

12:22.080 --> 12:26.720
Sorry, I don't know what it means but people's name is Sonia.

12:27.240 --> 12:35.000
But in Italy, they are giving rather international names like that...[unclear]

12:35.320 --> 12:36.240
It's Indian name.

12:36.440 --> 12:36.920
Sonia? Yes.

12:37.120 --> 12:39.960
Sonia it's Indian name, actually. See,

12:41.440 --> 12:44.560
like our Sonu, and I'll tell to Miss Ramani, Gavin Pallav Sonu,

12:44.920 --> 12:48.240
and out of love we'll call Sonia, out of love, you see, like that.

12:53.240 --> 12:58.440
Just like that. But that is now taken there like, Sonia.

12:58.680 --> 13:00.520
I was surprised, it's an Indian name.

13:01.720 --> 13:07.040
Or, our Cinzia. In Italy there's a name they give a lot, Cinzia.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.320
This must, this must be chinese.

13:10.120 --> 13:14.320
Cinzia. It's a lovely little girl, her name is Cinzia.

13:15.240 --> 13:17.880
Cinzia. Or south Indian.

13:20.040 --> 13:21.080
Ah, Cynthia.

13:21.280 --> 13:22.280
Must be from Cynthia.

13:22.520 --> 13:23.960
Ah, Cynthia.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.320
Must be from Cynthia.

13:26.520 --> 13:27.960
That's met in chinese I think,

13:28.160 --> 13:30.920
cinz and all these were setlled in chinese.

13:35.400 --> 13:39.440
Like, you see, we make it sweeter we'll call it "a" like that,

13:39.880 --> 13:41.240
like to the daughter, we call her,

13:41.440 --> 13:44.560
say beti means daughter but to sweeten it "betia", like that.

13:55.240 --> 13:59.960
We are quite familiar. Not feeling shy so much.

14:01.480 --> 14:04.160
Is that one [more]? [Hindi].

14:05.400 --> 14:07.880
Disturbed. No, I have to see the mouth.

14:15.960 --> 14:17.600
That suddenly ate [without a problem].

14:21.640 --> 14:23.280
Now you must give me bunch otherwise.

14:24.520 --> 14:25.640
Paula, Paula is making.

14:26.680 --> 14:31.600
Or I can do it. You see what I, listen, keep it. I'll come back and have.

14:32.880 --> 14:34.600
No, I think it's ready soon, Mother.

14:34.800 --> 14:36.400
Is it ready? It's all right. Otherwise don't cook.

14:36.600 --> 14:37.720
It's so much ready Mother.

14:37.920 --> 14:41.720
Otherwise I can come back and have. I'm not in a hurry, at all.

14:46.320 --> 14:54.080
So you have to little bit educate Me about America.

14:54.680 --> 14:56.400
How to tackle them really.

14:59.120 --> 15:02.040
I'll do everything I can. I'll do everything I can.

15:02.440 --> 15:05.200
Now you just tell Me about. Or say, take it like this,

15:05.960 --> 15:09.240
when you came to Sahaja Yoga what impressed you,

15:09.440 --> 15:13.999
how you behave you see, what was your psychological barrier? Let's see that.

15:14.360 --> 15:16.320
Because you see that's how I can tackle them.

15:18.720 --> 15:19.640
What do you say?

15:25.040 --> 15:29.440
I think it was the [intimately slope] connected with the things I did before

15:30.200 --> 15:36.040
with my preconceptions about what Realization was, wasn't, and

15:36.560 --> 15:40.920
well I had to realize what I had to fulfill. It was really...

15:43.080 --> 15:45.880
All right, all right, doesn't matter, doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.

15:46.120 --> 15:51.520
So through the [unclear], so I realized that,

15:52.160 --> 15:54.160
I couldn't compare it with anything,

15:54.360 --> 15:57.320
and I couldn't judge it with anything because it's [quite apart].

15:57.520 --> 15:59.200
Come here. Come here.

15:59.400 --> 16:02.760
It's a good idea to understand it that way.

16:03.480 --> 16:05.920
You see because Sahaja Yoga has many, many aspects

16:06.120 --> 16:07.680
and many you see things are,

16:08.040 --> 16:11.840
but to whom it will appeal what is we should try to find out, isn't it?

16:12.040 --> 16:14.920
What intellectual side of Sahaja Yoga appealed to you?

16:15.160 --> 16:17.999
Oh, I didn't rely to the things I knew.

16:18.360 --> 16:19.200
Knew already.

16:19.400 --> 16:23.160
But from experience and I could see that here must be something,

16:23.400 --> 16:26.400
by which I judge other things by that rose and judged

16:26.880 --> 16:29.080
Sahaja yoga what I did before,

16:29.320 --> 16:32.400
because nothing else has given me, that thing, thoughtless awareness.

16:33.280 --> 16:36.920
So then how shoud I proceed with them? Should I tell them that,

16:38.360 --> 16:40.960
if I tell them say for example that nothing you can relate it to,

16:41.280 --> 16:45.640
whatever you have known so far. Will they be happy to know that?

16:46.560 --> 16:49.680
That, that should be a good thing to say.

16:50.840 --> 16:54.720
I mean it appealed to me anyway but rest let's see.

16:55.080 --> 17:00.440
I mean it must because there's a little thing at least that

17:01.600 --> 17:04.040
I have to seek something new, I mean something different.

17:04.720 --> 17:07.440
The newness of it, that may appeal.

17:07.680 --> 17:08.800
Yes.

17:09.600 --> 17:13.880
The idea that I had trouble with, was the only the way to deal with

17:14.240 --> 17:17.920
cause I had all these ideas within otherwise, different.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.600
No idea should have.

17:20.600 --> 17:27.200
That sort of [napoleonesian], sophisticated and modern staff, and I think

17:27.560 --> 17:30.000
they haven't been limited to one thing,

17:30.560 --> 17:33.240
cause at first was [unclear].

17:33.440 --> 17:35.600
Accept that there's only one [way] for everyone.

17:36.280 --> 17:41.440
Tell them that seems to be a difficult thing for most people, the Nirakar.

17:43.720 --> 17:48.400
But why, the basic reason they want to have many things because

17:49.720 --> 17:55.080
see the choice, a choice, they want to have a choice.

17:55.680 --> 17:59.080
That's a very ego feeling you see,

17:59.440 --> 18:01.280
because as I told you that in America if you go,

18:01.480 --> 18:04.280
you must better ask them how to open the tap.

18:05.360 --> 18:06.520
Otherwise try to open the tap

18:06.720 --> 18:11.480
and you may find you are going into the swimming pool.

18:12.480 --> 18:15.560
And they have all different types, tiles they'll have different,

18:16.160 --> 18:17.520
the door knobs different,

18:17.720 --> 18:20.040
the opening style different, everything different.

18:20.640 --> 18:22.560
So this choice bussiness you see.

18:23.360 --> 18:28.720
But there is no choice with Divine. It's already decided.

18:30.280 --> 18:32.560
But that you find it difficult to accept like that.

18:37.400 --> 18:43.680
When it is selling, when it is selling, then you can have choice.

18:44.880 --> 18:47.560
But when somebody's giving, how can you have choice?

18:52.240 --> 18:53.880
But you can't understand giving,

18:56.520 --> 18:59.360
because that is also not related to what you have known so far.

18:59.880 --> 19:01.480
[You are merely a human being.]

19:18.840 --> 19:22.120
Still going inside.

19:22.480 --> 19:28.040
It's like the feeding of the five thousands Mother.

19:28.360 --> 19:29.640
You are hungry?

19:29.920 --> 19:30.840
Can you believe it?

19:35.080 --> 19:37.560
Believe Mother, yes, we can.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.720
Twenty one.

19:45.920 --> 19:47.040
Now, she take it. So much.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.520
Thirty-one Mother.

19:52.720 --> 19:54.040
Really?

19:54.240 --> 19:55.360
Yes.

19:56.560 --> 19:57.840
You were all wondering.

20:00.560 --> 20:04.680
Because there was a [honey in the poppy].

20:07.280 --> 20:09.720
So many things happen like that, little, little things you see.

20:09.920 --> 20:12.160
We had this Sahasrara program.

20:12.480 --> 20:15.400
And for that they decided a very far-fetched thing.

20:15.960 --> 20:19.320
It was to go to an absolute wild place,

20:20.320 --> 20:22.840
which you are going to have this time when you will go to India.

20:23.560 --> 20:26.760
And we had to go through a, ply through a,

20:27.120 --> 20:36.440
about hundred yards of sea to go to the other side of an island.

20:36.760 --> 20:39.800
And there is open sea the other side. So we went down.

20:40.520 --> 20:46.000
And they said they have to do the cooking. So what should we do?

20:46.720 --> 20:48.960
So the boys you see, in India, are hopeless absolutely,

20:49.160 --> 20:51.320
they don't know how to do anything whatsoever.

20:52.880 --> 20:56.280
Moody and her brother, and Mr. Pradhan and all these people,

20:56.480 --> 21:00.600
they said, "Now tell us how to do this, something cooking, simple",

21:01.560 --> 21:05.800
acchha, some sort of a pulao, rice pulao. I said, "All right."

21:06.120 --> 21:09.999
While we were driving in the car you see, I told them how to do it.

21:10.640 --> 21:12.920
I told them "Take now. For how many people?"

21:13.600 --> 21:17.320
It was for, they said about three hundred people.

21:17.600 --> 21:20.400
Theree hundred people? Now you have never touched it,

21:20.600 --> 21:24.320
you don't know how to cook. They said, "Then we tell somebody."

21:24.680 --> 21:29.680
There's a cook coming out. So in the car I told them for,

21:32.440 --> 21:37.280
for three hundred people, how much rice, how much ghee,

21:37.680 --> 21:41.760
how much masala, how much everything, all that I told them in weight.

21:42.960 --> 21:45.400
In fifteen minutes I told them how to make it, everything.

21:46.520 --> 21:49.760
And, then, when we went there,

21:50.160 --> 21:54.400
it was such a perfect pulao, you can't imagine. Such a miracle.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.360
And everybody said, "We have never eaten such a pulao.

21:57.560 --> 22:00.880
Who has made this and how it has worked out?"

22:01.080 --> 22:03.040
"The cook had never done it that way", they said.

22:03.520 --> 22:07.560
And there were ten hings to be put and at least

22:08.280 --> 22:12.680
six, seven masalas to be put. This has to go there and so many things.

22:12.880 --> 22:16.200
Not like kichri. That is called like Ravan bhat, means the,

22:16.400 --> 22:21.320
as Ravana had ten heads, you see like that, it was the rice.

22:21.600 --> 22:26.160
It came out so perfect and so tasty and so fragrant,

22:27.480 --> 22:30.640
Of, I don't know, it was such a miracle for three hundred people.

22:30.840 --> 22:32.280
And they were four hundred.

22:34.280 --> 22:39.200
And the whole, I mean the masala has to be absoutely perfect for that size.

22:39.640 --> 22:41.960
And what they did, they went to the market, they all asked,

22:42.160 --> 22:45.680
"Give us so much, so much, so much, so many kilos, so many kilos", all right.

22:45.880 --> 22:48.999
And they gave it to the cook. See, this is the recipe, just try.

22:49.360 --> 22:52.920
The whole thing worked out absolutely perfect.

22:54.240 --> 22:59.080
And everybody ate and ate and ate and ate.

22:59.920 --> 23:02.120
So much so that they couldn't lift their bodies.

23:05.920 --> 23:09.120
Absolutely dead time. And I told them that returning time,

23:09.320 --> 23:10.920
better keep it six o'clock,

23:11.120 --> 23:13.560
because I know what will happen after they eat that rice.

23:14.760 --> 23:18.680
And it was absolutely sufficient for everyone.

23:20.160 --> 23:23.520
And we had taken one gentleman with us who had never been to Sahaja Yoga.

23:23.720 --> 23:26.680
He said, "I've never enjoied in my life so much, so much I enjoied now."

23:28.360 --> 23:31.240
And everything was first class and I told them about,

23:31.680 --> 23:33.840
they've made also curry out of the yogurt.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.600
"Little thing", I said, "you add to that,

23:37.680 --> 23:44.160
of the we did, called raw coconut.

23:44.920 --> 23:46.920
And the whole thing was so good

23:47.600 --> 23:50.640
that they were wondering how it was worked so exact,

23:51.720 --> 23:55.320
cause you see these spices are very dangerous thing, I mean

23:55.880 --> 23:58.240
if you have something more or less it doesn't come out.

23:58.840 --> 24:03.999
But it just worked out. And fifteen minutes I had to tell them, in the car.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.600
Ramesh was sitting in front. He was writting so many kilos,

24:06.800 --> 24:08.880
so many kilos, so many kilos, so many kilos.

24:10.640 --> 24:12.800
And forty kilos of rice was cooked.

24:15.880 --> 24:18.600
And four hundred people ate.

24:23.960 --> 24:25.600
And the, you must get the tape.

24:27.640 --> 24:31.240
Did you get the tape for other [yogis], Sahasrara day?

24:35.080 --> 24:37.520
I don't think. But was it in New Delhi?

24:38.240 --> 24:42.120
No, from Bombay. Did you get? One from Bombay.

24:42.320 --> 24:45.720
Mother, we wrote a letter with most of the talks in it.

24:47.040 --> 24:48.400
I don't think [that I did see it], Mother.

24:48.600 --> 24:52.560
I'm just saying it is going to be within the Nirmala, you know their names, [unclear name].

24:53.360 --> 24:56.480
Then it's all right. Then it's all right.

25:16.160 --> 25:17.880
If it is translated shoud be all right.

25:18.600 --> 25:23.080
Yesterday's speech was good, was not at all bad. It was very good, isn't it?

25:24.040 --> 25:28.600
It has cleared out many people, it was nicely balanced.

25:32.520 --> 25:40.200
So now, the first thing I have to tell them, and you say it,

25:41.440 --> 25:46.999
that it does not relate to what you have known so far.

25:48.800 --> 25:53.080
But with Americans another problem is they are very sold out to traditions.

25:55.360 --> 25:58.680
So if you talk, if endeavours... I must tell you an experience.

25:59.280 --> 26:02.280
There was one fellow with the, very well known man there,

26:02.480 --> 26:06.840
who does lot of hindi this that, came to see Me.

26:07.160 --> 26:09.680
And when I was talking to him then he asked Me,

26:09.880 --> 26:15.600
"What do you think of [Shivananda]?"

26:17.080 --> 26:18.200
Right, have some more.

26:25.120 --> 26:27.760
Jugglery going on.

26:44.840 --> 26:52.160
And that gentleman, he said that, no I told him that,

26:53.200 --> 26:55.200
"He was not good, Ramakrishna was not good".

26:55.400 --> 26:56.960
Immediately he folded all his [papers].

26:57.160 --> 27:00.240
And then he said, "I [am gratified]. Thank you very much".

27:01.160 --> 27:03.240
And then these people telephoned to him. They said,

27:03.440 --> 27:07.840
"Why, why did you behave like this towards Mother? Why did you do this?

27:08.200 --> 27:10.880
So he said, "But, you see, this Sahaja Yoga is not registered".

27:12.240 --> 27:13.480
He said: "What do you mean?"

27:13.680 --> 27:16.280
He said, " Why should She say such a thing about Ramkrishna?

27:16.480 --> 27:18.480
According to them Ramkrishna is very traditional.

27:19.120 --> 27:21.320
In which way Ramkrishna is traditional?

27:21.800 --> 27:24.960
That he used to dance, he used to dress up like a lady,

27:25.680 --> 27:28.800
do all kinds of dramas. Which tradition is that in India?

27:29.920 --> 27:32.080
But they have certain conceptions of the traditions.

27:32.280 --> 27:34.920
Only fifty years old tradition they have.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.640
And then anything you tell them...

27:39.320 --> 27:40.360
You were there for this Louise meeting,

27:40.560 --> 27:42.960
you see that girl asked Me a question.

27:43.720 --> 27:44.800
No, I was at the theater.

27:45.480 --> 27:46.800
But I couldn't manage so...

27:46.999 --> 27:48.080
Louise, you were not there?

27:48.320 --> 27:49.320
No, I was not.

27:49.920 --> 27:52.280
She asked Me a question about the tradition part of it

27:52.480 --> 27:54.240
and I told her what was the traditional.

27:54.680 --> 27:56.720
and this was all kept a secret for six centuries.

27:56.920 --> 27:59.440
Nobody talked about Realization.

28:01.320 --> 28:05.120
You see, to them tradition means whatever people have been working out

28:05.320 --> 28:09.720
for the last fifty years extension it's tradition. It's not.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.200
On the contrary all these fifty years

28:12.400 --> 28:15.160
have ruined all the traditions, absolutely.

28:18.680 --> 28:20.760
Absolutely. No traditions at all.

28:22.360 --> 28:26.640
So fifty years back came the start of [unclear],

28:27.720 --> 28:29.520
about fifty years back when I was born.

28:30.680 --> 28:38.600
And just after My birth everything moved in such a fast way

28:38.800 --> 28:42.840
in negative side because they knew that now their end has come.

28:43.760 --> 28:47.800
So the anti God activities became extremely powerful.

28:48.600 --> 28:52.120
The day I was baptized was the fifteenth day of My birth,

28:53.800 --> 28:58.360
and there was a carriage by which we were going.

28:59.160 --> 29:01.720
You see, on these days we used to have strong horses in India.

29:02.720 --> 29:08.200
And the horse fell down, the horse went up like that, actually

29:08.880 --> 29:12.560
and the cart fell down, it broke into two and I fell inside the cart.

29:13.200 --> 29:15.760
On top of Me was the cart, on top of that fell all these things.

29:17.760 --> 29:18.880
Nothing happen to Me.

29:21.680 --> 29:25.120
See the negativity, how fast it has worked.

29:32.800 --> 29:39.320
Then, after that, I got terrible blisters on My body, all over the body.

29:40.720 --> 29:43.080
For six months I was just covered with blisters.

29:44.840 --> 29:46.440
So many were negative forces like that.

29:47.840 --> 29:50.960
I still have one or two marks in the body, one mark here.

29:53.920 --> 29:57.760
So you can imagine, how powerful these forces were like that.

30:00.680 --> 30:02.999
But My mother said that, "You were bleeding,

30:04.360 --> 30:06.880
never you cried about it". Nothing.

30:07.080 --> 30:09.080
"You were blleding and we were afraid to touch you

30:09.280 --> 30:11.240
cause all body was filled with blisters".

30:14.440 --> 30:17.200
But from nothing at all it came so they did not understand.

30:22.640 --> 30:24.720
So how negativity has worked throughout,

30:25.920 --> 30:30.520
shows that they just expedited all their forces, brought in.

30:31.520 --> 30:37.880
So these six years, as of course, Sahaja Yoga,

30:39.120 --> 30:43.480
has come out of it, but the other side is also very deep,

30:43.760 --> 30:46.640
and it has a very deep [nearing] in America.

30:47.600 --> 30:53.440
But last sixty years have been important for America also, very important.

30:56.920 --> 31:00.320
And how many changes in these last sixty years in America has taken place,

31:01.560 --> 31:02.999
how many presidents you have had?

31:05.120 --> 31:09.999
I think when I was born... When did Abraham Lincoln died?

31:12.600 --> 31:18.320
1866, '67 just after the Civil War.

31:19.560 --> 31:20.680
And then?

31:21.160 --> 31:25.960
Then Grant, Ulysses S. Grant as I know, I suppose it.

31:26.360 --> 31:29.960
Eisenhower came. Before Eisenhower who was [president]?

31:31.280 --> 31:32.440
Truman, Mother.

31:32.680 --> 31:37.840
Truman. Truman came. I think from My birth was Truman.

31:38.080 --> 31:43.360
You see, Truman came, then Eisenhower, and it's how many?

31:44.040 --> 31:49.120
Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, I think Nixon.

31:49.680 --> 31:52.040
Johnson.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.480
Johnson, Nixon.

31:55.760 --> 31:57.480
Five, just imagine.

31:58.720 --> 32:01.480
And in sixty years time. Who was before Truman?

32:05.760 --> 32:06.520
Eisenhower?

32:06.720 --> 32:08.720
No, Roosevelt, Roosevelt.

32:08.920 --> 32:10.999
No, no, Roosevelt it is. Roosevelt.

32:11.280 --> 32:16.080
I was with Roosevelt. I remember Roosevelt was, [very well].

32:17.120 --> 32:19.920
Roosevelt was one great person, he was very good.

32:21.160 --> 32:26.040
After Roosevelt it's going round and round.

32:29.960 --> 32:38.360
This Reagen is, he has no vision, he has no hail, feelings, nothing.

32:41.280 --> 32:46.320
You see to combat Russia, you must have people like Mahatma Gadhi.

32:51.520 --> 32:54.280
See, [you need] the power of human beings you see.

32:55.080 --> 33:00.280
Not people like Reagen, not like that, nor this Mrs. Margaret Thacher.

33:01.600 --> 33:04.280
You need people like Mahatma Gandhi to fight these.

33:07.280 --> 33:12.480
To fight a sword you must have a shield, proper shield, not a sword.

33:16.240 --> 33:19.040
And if you could produce someone like Abraham Lincoln now,

33:19.560 --> 33:20.800
you can go very high.

33:21.600 --> 33:24.920
But that one also, Abraham Lincoln is another great blessing they had,

33:25.120 --> 33:26.240
what a real blessing.

33:26.800 --> 33:30.200
There was only one road somewhere very far-fetched I saw once,

33:31.360 --> 33:32.960
in his name. Nothing else I saw.

33:34.720 --> 33:37.080
I mean once a statue I saw of Abraham Lincoln.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.840
And he was the greatest man you could think of.

33:43.880 --> 33:46.680
And even greater than Jawaharlal Nehru or anyone because,

33:47.480 --> 33:51.120
he had such great conceptions and such great ideas about freedom and all.

33:53.040 --> 33:57.400
What about these days Reagen and all? I mean imagine a cinema actor.

34:00.920 --> 34:02.520
English would not accept that at least.

34:04.480 --> 34:12.000
Of course, even Margaret Thacher is petty trader sort of a person.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.880
But, Reagen I just don't understand.

34:24.800 --> 34:27.320
There didn't seem to be much choice from the another one.

34:27.560 --> 34:32.120
There didn't seem to be much choice just because of damage of Jimmy Carter.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.200
That's true.

34:33.600 --> 34:34.680
There is no other choice.

34:34.880 --> 34:36.999
First the Jimmi Carter was wrong also.

34:38.320 --> 34:40.600
That's like stepping down one after another.

34:40.840 --> 34:44.200
So between them two what to do?

34:48.720 --> 34:51.440
But you have such a great country, you have such great feelings.

34:52.480 --> 34:54.840
You have only these two clowns there to voted for?

34:55.120 --> 34:58.520
What I am saying, why not bringing out some great people?

34:59.400 --> 35:03.000
People with ideas, people with higher thinking.

35:03.200 --> 35:05.960
Or you cannot beat Russians otherwise,

35:06.400 --> 35:09.080
unless and until you drop Reagan.

35:10.200 --> 35:15.680
You have to tell them all these bad things. Then Russians can't talk.

35:19.760 --> 35:23.240
Mother, there is such a show bussiness attitude towards everything.

35:23.520 --> 35:27.240
They have no, they don't take it seriously.

35:28.240 --> 35:34.720
Even the West, with the Indians and they just make movies out of it.

35:35.320 --> 35:39.360
They never see the reality.

35:46.200 --> 35:48.240
Is it, is it because they harm their roots?

35:48.440 --> 35:50.920
Oh, you must have leaders who are visionaries, you see,

35:52.320 --> 35:55.200
those who have bigger ideas. Otherwise how are they leaders?

35:55.920 --> 35:58.120
Leaders must have some big ideas.

35:58.400 --> 36:03.120
You see the leader's schedule is that a leader will never

36:04.840 --> 36:07.440
tackle small problems of the followers but give them problems,

36:07.640 --> 36:12.240
"All right, solve this. Solve this problem."

36:12.440 --> 36:15.600
We have to do, now I have to go to America, now tell Me what am I to do.

36:16.120 --> 36:20.600
That's how you should lead people. Put their mind into it.

36:20.800 --> 36:24.000
Instead of that you put your mind into their smaller problems, you see.

36:24.480 --> 36:25.880
Finished.

36:28.120 --> 36:30.360
Do you think Mother that it's maybe because they,

36:31.160 --> 36:35.240
they don't feel their own roots, they don't feel their own worth, that they?...

36:37.560 --> 36:40.480
Well, you see, it has an advantage that also because if

36:40.680 --> 36:43.720
they don't feel their roots they should think of much higher things.

36:45.680 --> 36:48.080
Because deep rooted people can be cracked you see,

36:48.880 --> 36:51.800
conditioned type, very conditioned type.

36:52.600 --> 36:55.600
But they should really fly out with their wings.

36:56.560 --> 36:59.360
Instead of that, that is floating here and there.

37:00.200 --> 37:03.360
Actually those who have no roots should fly out, isn't it?

37:03.920 --> 37:05.480
I mean those who have roots,

37:05.680 --> 37:08.840
the birds are higher than the trees, aren't they?

37:09.040 --> 37:10.120
Yes.

37:12.240 --> 37:14.200
And I had that feeling about,

37:14.560 --> 37:17.800
because if you read Abraham Lincoln you do feel "isn't that sahaj?"

37:21.440 --> 37:23.560
Really he was talking of golden age I think.

37:24.080 --> 37:25.000
Was a new country.

37:25.200 --> 37:27.720
Absolutely. And the newness, and the

37:28.280 --> 37:32.800
new ideas, and all that, it's all brought down, just like that,

37:33.240 --> 37:35.040
collapsing type.

37:41.760 --> 37:47.080
Now, say, French, very deep rooted, now where are they going?

37:48.400 --> 37:49.760
Horrible.

37:52.080 --> 37:54.280
They hate everyone, very big headache they are.

37:54.480 --> 37:59.520
I tell you, wherever there's a French, you say... in the diplomatic...

37:59.720 --> 38:03.000
No, no, you are a yogi. He's a yogi now, he's a yogi.

38:03.200 --> 38:05.160
But it's a fact. You ask him, it's not a fact?

38:05.400 --> 38:06.400
That's true Mother.

38:06.960 --> 38:08.920
You see, for nothing at all they create a problem

38:09.120 --> 38:11.720
and in diplomatics services, ah...

38:12.760 --> 38:14.320
This is the time?

38:14.960 --> 38:17.040
They create problems after problems.

38:24.200 --> 38:26.200
What is it? I have to talk there.

38:26.640 --> 38:27.880
Then you should eat Mother.

38:28.520 --> 38:31.680
But I'll sleep like a log of wood if you give me all that.

38:31.880 --> 38:32.999
It's just seaweed and [unclear].

38:33.440 --> 38:34.280
All right.

38:36.280 --> 38:37.760
All right, it seems that it is quite big...

38:37.960 --> 38:40.920
That's fish. It looks so nice, you can't imagine.

38:41.200 --> 38:42.320
Which is the seaweed?

38:42.840 --> 38:44.640
It's the black underneath, is the seaweed.

38:45.040 --> 38:48.200
It's that? All right. And that's the fish.

38:48.440 --> 38:49.560
Yes.

38:50.200 --> 38:54.440
And this is sunflower and sesami seeds. That's all, Mother.

38:55.320 --> 38:57.560
Then I will have like this. You see that.

39:00.960 --> 39:02.320
Just like this.

39:04.960 --> 39:05.999
You got the seaweed.

39:06.200 --> 39:07.320
Yes.

39:08.200 --> 39:10.200
I'll see with this bite little bit.

39:18.160 --> 39:18.800
Fine.

39:19.040 --> 39:20.160
Yes.

39:21.680 --> 39:22.800
Excellent.

39:29.440 --> 39:31.080
You said this is chinese?

39:32.000 --> 39:32.760
Japanese.

39:32.999 --> 39:33.720
Japanese?

39:34.160 --> 39:35.560
Seaweed.

39:35.999 --> 39:38.640
Oh, horrible Japanese are. They can't make like this.

39:42.040 --> 39:44.080
They just can't make that.

39:51.120 --> 39:53.200
This Chantal has told me how to make it.

39:53.760 --> 39:54.880
Chantal has done?

39:55.440 --> 39:57.480
She, she said how to make it this morning.

39:58.400 --> 40:00.920
Very nice, I tell you, it's very, very nice.

40:09.680 --> 40:12.720
And the fish is very good, too.

40:41.760 --> 40:43.840
Pamela is the one who made it or she has made it?

40:44.680 --> 40:48.720
I made it Mother, but Chantal told me how to make the seaweed.

40:52.480 --> 40:54.320
What did you do with the fish?

40:55.160 --> 40:58.400
Just baked it. In the oven.

40:59.280 --> 41:00.080
Just baked it?

41:00.280 --> 41:01.400
Yes.

41:06.600 --> 41:07.720
Remarcable.

41:11.840 --> 41:15.840
What else you have? Mushroomss?

41:16.040 --> 41:23.200
Mushrooms, carrots, onions and that's all.

41:23.400 --> 41:26.040
A little bit of [tomato] sauce and ginger.

41:28.400 --> 41:29.400
And there's butter also.

41:29.640 --> 41:31.720
A little bit of ghee. I kept at minimum.

41:31.920 --> 41:32.480
Little bit.

41:32.680 --> 41:33.680
A little bit ghee.

41:33.999 --> 41:35.080
Ghee.

41:35.280 --> 41:36.320
Did You like this ghee?

41:36.600 --> 41:38.680
Very good. Excellent.

41:51.760 --> 41:53.880
You must eat nice ovened.

41:54.600 --> 41:57.520
And I should find out about this shop in London.

41:58.400 --> 41:59.520
What shop you were saying?

41:59.760 --> 42:01.440
Diwali shop, yes, Mother.

42:02.560 --> 42:04.480
You get seaweed there?

42:04.760 --> 42:06.160
I don't know.

42:06.360 --> 42:07.240
Where do you you get seaweeds?

42:07.440 --> 42:09.840
Neal's yard. Neal's yard.

42:10.560 --> 42:12.280
You can get it in the yard. Chantal's work place Mother.

42:12.480 --> 42:14.560
Should I get it for You?

42:16.040 --> 42:20.400
Oh, I'll ask Chantal to come and use My home how to do it.

42:29.920 --> 42:31.920
I never knew seaweed it was so nice.

42:46.920 --> 42:48.160
I never knew that it was so nice.

42:48.360 --> 42:50.560
I thought that Japanese eat everything so...

43:03.080 --> 43:06.440
She works in a health, health trade, does she?

43:06.720 --> 43:08.120
She works in a diary, Mother.

43:09.080 --> 43:11.360
She makes the cheese and yogurt in the diary.

43:11.880 --> 43:13.000
Dairy?

43:17.480 --> 43:19.720
You were doing something else, that was he?

43:20.999 --> 43:23.680
You were not collectively doing that sort of thing.

43:23.999 --> 43:28.720
I've met Paul there who introduced me to You at the meeting.

43:28.960 --> 43:30.080
Oh, I see.

43:30.960 --> 43:31.680
Whom did you meet?

43:31.880 --> 43:33.280
Paul Dante.

43:33.480 --> 43:34.600
Paul.

43:38.160 --> 43:42.640
Winston told Me something.

43:49.120 --> 43:53.360
I used to think that was, Covent Garden was beyond the river.

43:54.720 --> 43:57.280
That day, first day when I went there I knew it was here.

43:57.680 --> 43:58.800
I've never seen it before.

43:59.200 --> 44:04.920
And that, that system or so, that clock you know, that's very interesting.

44:07.280 --> 44:09.560
And we reached there at the time when it was...

44:10.720 --> 44:12.080
Hello, how are you today?

44:12.480 --> 44:13.720
Sorry for coming late, Mother.

44:13.920 --> 44:18.280
No, it's all right. We went out. I bought some laces.

44:21.560 --> 44:23.680
Do you know there is very nice shop down,

44:25.240 --> 44:28.440
which sells all sort of past work, they sell the past.

44:28.640 --> 44:30.680
Antiques. The past for sell.

44:30.880 --> 44:38.520
Not antiques, laces and very nice...

44:39.960 --> 44:44.080
I bought for twenty pounds so many laces, you can't imagine.

44:44.960 --> 44:48.999
Laces, lace work, lace, we call,

44:50.240 --> 44:50.920
Curtains?

44:51.120 --> 44:54.520
Complete curtains, made of hand, made in hand, with thread.

44:55.080 --> 44:56.720
Can you show her? They are still in the car.

44:56.920 --> 44:58.320
They are still in the car, Mother.

44:58.840 --> 44:59.720
In which car?

45:00.160 --> 45:01.280
With Paul.

45:06.920 --> 45:09.160
Mother I wanted to give You this one,

45:09.360 --> 45:12.480
and wanted to show you what has happened

45:12.840 --> 45:14.560
because last last year in Hampstead,

45:14.999 --> 45:16.560
remember we gave You one like this

45:16.760 --> 45:19.080
and I remember how much Mother I loved it.

45:19.440 --> 45:21.360
And we had one, this one at home.

45:21.920 --> 45:25.520
For one year we've kept it and it was resting.

45:25.960 --> 45:28.680
And just quiet because it is not yet the season

45:29.080 --> 45:30.840
and everyday I was looking at it.

45:31.560 --> 45:36.400
And four days back I thought, "Ah, I think, I feel  when Mother comes,

45:36.960 --> 45:40.560
it would make a flower and when I woke up this morning,

45:41.040 --> 45:43.840
this was present.

45:44.200 --> 45:46.720
How sweet it is.

45:46.920 --> 45:51.400
You know this is called like a flower of eternal in India, anand,

45:52.080 --> 45:57.520
It's called as that, Gandhiji's [bhajan]. And then when you gave Me I really looked after it.

45:57.840 --> 46:00.240
See how many there are.

46:00.720 --> 46:05.720
Yesterday I just felt, I saw little buds coming and I felt, I was sure,

46:06.480 --> 46:09.600
because Mother loves it, it would know that You are here.

46:09.880 --> 46:12.360
You see how nature works it. So sweet.

46:12.560 --> 46:13.640
So great to see.

46:14.560 --> 46:16.000
Thank you very much.

46:19.560 --> 46:21.920
Actually I think this flower I discovered

46:22.480 --> 46:26.560
only just after I started Sahaja Yoga and named it.

46:27.800 --> 46:30.999
He wanted to know how the name of the Trust

46:31.840 --> 46:36.160
which was not very definite like Sahaja Yoga but something,

46:36.360 --> 46:38.120
little ambiguous I should say,

46:38.800 --> 46:42.600
so I set down like the Life Eternal, came into Life Eternal, you see.

46:44.040 --> 46:48.640
And, in marathi translation, hindi trasposed, anand jeevan.

46:50.280 --> 46:52.560
Then, after that, one day I discovered this flower,

46:52.760 --> 46:54.480
some people had brought.

46:55.480 --> 46:57.320
So I asked, "What is this flower called here?"

46:57.520 --> 47:01.200
They said, "It's called as the flower of eternal, anand".

47:04.120 --> 47:05.640
It has tremendous fragrance.

47:08.760 --> 47:12.240
But it's Indian flower after all.

47:15.320 --> 47:18.400
But the best part is most of your flowers are not fragrant.

47:28.520 --> 47:33.920
Nature works the knowledge details, knowledge details.

47:36.600 --> 47:41.880
And so many things I tell you now. In America I am going,

47:43.240 --> 47:46.920
the man who is going to helps us is dr. Marva. He says that

47:47.120 --> 47:51.080
he knows many people here and he will arrange a TV and everything,

47:52.320 --> 47:57.080
in Los Angeles. And see now, he's become the Mare of Los Angeles.

47:57.920 --> 47:59.840
Oh, great.

48:04.440 --> 48:06.880
What help we get.

48:08.400 --> 48:11.640
But despite all that as you told Me about that

48:13.520 --> 48:16.400
many [crawling in], despite all that,

48:18.080 --> 48:21.000
human beings are the ones who will get this done.

48:22.800 --> 48:25.320
Whatever we may try, God has find His level best,

48:26.200 --> 48:29.600
to do this and to do that, everything. Same thing in New York.

48:30.720 --> 48:34.800
There was one dr. Lanjeevan whom I met and he wanted Me,

48:35.720 --> 48:37.920
somehow or another to talk to doctors and all that.

48:38.680 --> 48:44.160
But he said, "I don't know, I feel they don't listen to me and all that".

48:45.600 --> 48:48.960
And he became the chairman, chairman

48:49.400 --> 48:53.880
of all the practicing doctors of New York, that association.

48:54.800 --> 48:56.560
But then he refused to do anything for Me.

48:58.600 --> 49:03.120
And next year lost his job, got into trouble, everything he had.

49:03.720 --> 49:07.360
But he became the chairman and refused to do anything for Me.

49:07.560 --> 49:09.400
Then he had problems.

49:18.560 --> 49:25.720
So nature, even God's help, everything is perfect. You can't blame it.

49:27.680 --> 49:30.480
The earnestness of Sahaja Yoghis, their desire,

49:31.560 --> 49:33.760
to get so many to Sahaja Yoga. Everything is there.

49:34.840 --> 49:38.280
But somehow the negative forces are so active,

49:39.600 --> 49:42.800
that human beings you see, they can't see things through.

49:44.400 --> 49:47.240
It's very sad. What's going to happen to all these people?

49:48.480 --> 49:51.240
They don't know they will go to hell and hell is so horrid.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.120
There's no other way out.

50:08.440 --> 50:11.320
I mean I can go to any extent to please them, to do what they want

50:11.520 --> 50:14.120
but they must get their Realization.

50:35.480 --> 50:37.400
There's somebody who wanted to meet Me.

50:39.160 --> 50:44.280
So C.P. said, "He must come and see You. You are a saint.

50:46.040 --> 50:48.040
He's coming to see you as a saint. He should come and see You.

50:48.280 --> 50:51.520
Why should You go and see him? I said, "Baba, it doesn't matter.

50:52.280 --> 50:54.480
But if it will help Sahaja Yoga I will go and see him.

50:55.120 --> 50:56.880
I don't mind, I have no dignity, nothing.

50:57.280 --> 51:00.360
I'll just go and see the fellow if it works out for good".

51:02.840 --> 51:06.680
But no... Trying.

51:30.400 --> 51:31.720
Such help, you can't imagine.

51:35.200 --> 51:41.400
I was in Bangalore and he was a yoga teacher.

51:45.440 --> 51:48.600
And he came to Me and he started to talk

51:50.640 --> 51:53.520
and as usually he became rather rude. He said,

51:54.000 --> 51:55.880
"But why should you say that You have got Realization?

51:56.080 --> 51:58.560
Why should You say that You can raise the Kundalini?"

51:59.120 --> 52:00.720
I said, "I never say".

52:01.840 --> 52:05.320
Because one of his assistants,

52:05.960 --> 52:08.280
had come to Me so I said, " I've never told her".

52:08.999 --> 52:12.440
She knows about Me, so many people know. Ask her.

52:13.640 --> 52:16.880
At that time only who comes in,

52:25.680 --> 52:30.840
