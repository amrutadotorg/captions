00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.970
and because of the cleansing
of the feet of Christ

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.400
they said, "Why should we waste such a lot of
oil? You can sell it and give it to the poor."

00:00:10.448 --> 00:00:12.948
but Christ said, now see what he said!

00:00:12.948 --> 00:00:19.496
that Christ Himself has said these words
and if they are depicted the same way.

00:00:19.512 --> 00:00:22.012
You just see the meaning and
what you should take out.

00:00:22.023 --> 00:00:28.055
He says that, "These poor are for
ever, but I am for a short time.

00:00:28.108 --> 00:00:33.070
You see? How clearly He has said that
there's no philanthropic work involved.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.015
But people take the other meaning! I don't
know from where you get the other meaning?

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.540
That you must  look after the poor.

00:00:42.572 --> 00:00:45.072
That's not you job at all!

00:00:45.676 --> 00:00:49.551
Alright Atul? That's not your
job to look after the poor.

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:52.961
What we have to work out,
in the middle, you see.

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:55.871
by which we can pull the right
and left to both the banks.

00:00:58.916 --> 00:01:02.481
You have to be in the middle. When
we are in the middle course,

00:01:02.504 --> 00:01:08.884
we first of all settle down ourselves nicely
and then the left and right can be engulfed.

00:01:08.884 --> 00:01:12.594
The poor and the rich! The
over-rich are horrid people!

00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:19.824
They smoke and they drink. I
mean, they are wretched people.

00:01:19.884 --> 00:01:22.384
Gambling, this, that, all
sorts of things they do.

00:01:22.384 --> 00:01:24.884
They waste their lives. They don't
know how to face themselves.

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:27.384
They are in the worst possible condition.

00:01:27.384 --> 00:01:32.205
And the poor are another style,
labour class and all that.

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.479
So you have to bring them
to the centre. But how?

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.979
You, yourself have the depth within yourself.

00:01:40.928 --> 00:01:44.138
You can pull of them together into this.

00:01:44.138 --> 00:01:46.638
First solution has to
come in the central path.

00:01:48.668 --> 00:01:49.518
Alright?

00:01:49.518 --> 00:01:54.338
So this is it, that, when you start doing your
philanthropic work, you cannot do it with Sahaja Yoga,

00:01:54.348 --> 00:01:55.688
you cannot.

00:01:55.688 --> 00:02:01.008
Of course, I mean poor is alright, in
the Indian villages, I can work it out.

00:02:01.044 --> 00:02:06.734
But very poor, they will not take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:06.794 --> 00:02:15.910
They'll take to drinking, smoking or if some
time is left, then burgling or cheating.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.781
They will take to these things, because
for them, eating is the main thing.

00:02:19.793 --> 00:02:22.293
Just like animals they are.

00:02:22.293 --> 00:02:27.350
And for the very rich, they
are another type of animal.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.920
They are vultures.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.750
They cannot live without being parasites.

00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:37.301
If you tell then anything,
they will not understand you.

00:02:37.301 --> 00:02:40.818
So, the upper class is useless and
the lower class is useless for us.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:48.130
Ours is the middle class, which has to
settle down with the values of Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:51.364
And then once they see
you, the river flowing,

00:02:54.245 --> 00:02:59.524
they can be enriched and
they will come to us.

00:02:59.558 --> 00:03:07.991
You are like a river and we have to enrich
both the banks, this side or that side.

00:03:09.591 --> 00:03:11.631
That is important.

00:03:11.631 --> 00:03:18.511
One side you have to cleanse the upper class
and the lower class you have to enrich them.

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:23.371
But if you do not have that within
yourselves, how are you going to do it?

00:03:23.864 --> 00:03:29.787
Sahaja Yoga is going to work for the
middle class. This is the point.

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:34.677
Not for the poor and the greedy.

00:03:34.707 --> 00:03:37.931
And that's a very wrong thing to
do, attention is put to the poor

00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:41.993
That's not our job. We have
not created the poor. Have we?

00:03:41.993 --> 00:03:43.363
We have not.

00:03:43.363 --> 00:03:45.863
Who has created them?

00:03:45.863 --> 00:03:47.986
The upper class!

00:03:47.986 --> 00:03:52.313
We club them together, the
upper and lower class.

00:03:52.337 --> 00:03:55.773
So they say, "We will have
Labour government."

00:03:55.817 --> 00:03:58.317
Both are just the same!

00:04:04.798 --> 00:04:09.506
That's it you see. They say by
denying God, we are challenging God.

00:04:09.546 --> 00:04:14.395
If they deny God, then God will fall at
their feet. That is why they deny God.

00:04:14.395 --> 00:04:16.276
Otherwise, what is the need?

00:04:16.276 --> 00:04:19.496
What matters? Is he
standing for any election?

00:04:19.506 --> 00:04:25.434
Is he contesting any election that you are saying,"We
do not believe in God?" What does it matter?

00:04:29.914 --> 00:04:35.024
So that is what we understand
that these are fools.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.570
Is there any way, Mother that...?

00:04:37.591 --> 00:04:44.023
That's what I said that, the way is that the middle
class, you see, the middle class should be developed.

00:04:44.023 --> 00:04:50.171
all these people who are on the extremes like
they say, I do not believe and I am angry."

00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:52.671
Then let it be.  You don't make them believe.

00:04:52.671 --> 00:04:57.698
Yes, but is there any way of helping them to
come to an understanding in the beginning?

00:04:57.738 --> 00:05:05.208
You see, if you think that you can make these
people believe, you cannot. It's wrong.

00:05:05.208 --> 00:05:11.518
They will not. They will not, because the more you will try to
do it, the more they'll continue, you see their ego is hurt.

00:05:11.518 --> 00:05:15.048
They are the people whose ego is hurt,
because they find some people rich. You see.

00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:19.396
Say, the person on this bank and on
this bank: he sees this, he sees this.

00:05:19.413 --> 00:05:21.913
We are somewhere down below here, alright?

00:05:21.913 --> 00:05:26.636
And they are seeing each other.
So their ego is hurt very much.

00:05:26.636 --> 00:05:29.136
And here there are people
who are egotistical.

00:05:29.136 --> 00:05:33.603
So both do not believe in God. What
does it matter if the believe it or not?

00:05:33.626 --> 00:05:36.126
There is God.

00:05:38.558 --> 00:05:43.458
You see they just want to say it out. Here
is, a big words! I have seen everybody.

00:05:43.508 --> 00:05:46.091
"I believe..." Now, who are you?

00:05:46.173 --> 00:05:50.948
Everyone says, "I believe into..." I
mean believing from where it has come?

00:05:50.948 --> 00:05:54.697
From where did you get this
belief? What is your experience?

00:05:55.992 --> 00:05:58.492
So that's how they do it.

00:05:59.402 --> 00:06:05.392
So they have to say, if a politician comes up and
gives a lecture. "I believe that this is this."

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:10.102
So everybody hears that, so they go on
home. They say, "I believe in this!"

00:06:10.102 --> 00:06:17.039
This is like ringing one bell, putting into another bell
and the resonance starts and everyone says, "I believe."

00:06:17.052 --> 00:06:22.122
You see, I find in this country, even
an ordinary beggar talks like that!

00:06:26.336 --> 00:06:28.566
There's no humility of any kind.

00:06:28.566 --> 00:06:34.006
That's why they talk like
that. They lack all humility.

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:37.489
They are so aggressive. You just
see how aggressive they are.

00:06:37.524 --> 00:06:39.239
They have aggressed all the cultures of the world.

00:06:39.239 --> 00:06:41.739
Now today's article, I brought
it for you to see especially.

00:06:41.739 --> 00:06:44.809
You see now, in say, Tehran,

00:06:44.869 --> 00:06:46.989
whatever they have done,
Tehranis have done,

00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:50.450
they have put a chaddar on a lady
and say,"You wear a chaddar."

00:06:50.453 --> 00:06:57.361
So an English lady writes about it. She
says, "They have made our body...."

00:06:57.393 --> 00:07:01.831
You see now, your attitude towards life, you can say
a British attitude or you can say a Western attitude

00:07:01.901 --> 00:07:05.001
is that your body is very
beautiful, so you must show it.

00:07:05.021 --> 00:07:07.876
Why? Why cheat yourself?

00:07:07.904 --> 00:07:12.666
It is not because your body is beautiful that
you are showing it off, but you want to catch it.

00:07:12.716 --> 00:07:15.726
It's simple.

00:07:15.746 --> 00:07:18.846
It is as simple as that.Face it!

00:07:18.856 --> 00:07:23.186
But you want all the world, all over
the world, the women should be like you.

00:07:26.881 --> 00:07:28.817
It's such a subtle
aggression. You don't know.

00:07:28.817 --> 00:07:35.837
They have killed all the cultures of the world with
this kind of an understanding that, "We are the best!"

00:07:35.837 --> 00:07:40.493
Most educated and sophisticated people.

00:07:44.372 --> 00:07:49.083
But others also must exist. They have their
own cultures, understand them and think.

00:07:49.113 --> 00:07:54.459
If you do not say, "Please, give
me this," then he is uncultured.

00:07:58.559 --> 00:08:04.368
You know, it is such a subtle
aggression on everybody's culture.

00:08:04.389 --> 00:08:09.018
That's how you have removed all the Indians
from say South America and North America.

00:08:09.068 --> 00:08:14.698
You see, everywhere, wherever these people
have gone they have finished the culture.

00:08:17.356 --> 00:08:25.676
It's a very, very special type of aggression these
people have and aggression has a reaction always.

00:08:25.765 --> 00:08:34.805
Either the other culture's people, those people who have other cultures, would strive to be this culture, because this is supposed to be the greatest of all.

00:08:34.849 --> 00:08:41.412
To say like that, that, "We should not be afraid
of showing, we should not be ashamed of our body."

00:08:41.455 --> 00:08:44.872
What is something like privacy within us?

00:08:44.892 --> 00:08:49.413
Is there nothing like privacy?
We should respect our bodies!

00:08:53.027 --> 00:08:56.127
Now if this is the attitude taken, that everybody

00:08:56.161 --> 00:09:00.858
"Oh, this woman is inhibited because
she does not show off her body."

00:09:00.885 --> 00:09:06.798
The showing off of the body is nothing
but ... It is a subtle prostitution!

00:09:09.328 --> 00:09:11.628
You see it's on and on and on.

00:09:11.628 --> 00:09:15.388
It's very subtle. Now another
suggestion comes in from there that,

00:09:15.386 --> 00:09:22.248
for twenty five years they cannot believe that people can
remain celibate because in this country people cannot.

00:09:24.351 --> 00:09:29.861
but there are so many countries where they
really remain celibate till they are married;

00:09:29.891 --> 00:09:32.453
so many of them.

00:09:33.485 --> 00:09:40.005
but according to them it is not possible, so those
who remain must be wrong. They are telling lies.

00:09:40.005 --> 00:09:43.609
And they force this on others
that, "You come like us only!

00:09:43.619 --> 00:09:48.219
Because our noses are cut,
so you also cut your noses."

00:09:51.929 --> 00:09:53.189
On all types of people

00:09:53.189 --> 00:09:58.062
if you go anywhere, all the Western people,
what they have ruined is the culture,

00:09:58.114 --> 00:10:03.542
it is the variety of culture. And such subtle
cultures they have reduced to nothing!

00:10:03.576 --> 00:10:11.125
And by their aggression they have told people
that, "We are (supposedly) the highest of highest.

00:10:11.125 --> 00:10:15.086
English language you must know! You
must know French! You must know this!"

00:10:20.164 --> 00:10:22.664
Don't open this door.

00:10:22.696 --> 00:10:26.934
So, you see what I am saying is when
we understand, we have to change.

00:10:26.934 --> 00:10:29.104
We must know we have to be really humble.

00:10:29.104 --> 00:10:32.257
Not in language, not in behaviour but inside.

00:10:32.319 --> 00:10:35.637
To know that we do not
aggress others. Alright?

00:10:35.653 --> 00:10:41.311
So this Labour has this one
problem, is only of aggression.

00:10:41.321 --> 00:10:44.726
One community here, you take example.

00:10:44.766 --> 00:10:47.822
Now, say you take an example, so called elite.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:51.852
That's why I liked Evita, they have
made a big satire on all the elites.

00:10:51.879 --> 00:10:59.732
The dancing how they do. They have made a satire on all the upper classes and all the lower classes and all that type.

00:10:59.732 --> 00:11:02.889
It's a very good one, I must say.
It's a very good satire. Evita!

00:11:02.889 --> 00:11:05.251
It's a very good satire ever since long.

00:11:05.251 --> 00:11:12.799
So, now, if you have that aggression within
you existing, then better take it out.

00:11:16.586 --> 00:11:21.840
The culture of the Spirit has to
come in you. That has to be there.

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:29.632
If that culture doesn't come, then
these all cultures are very aggressive,

00:11:29.646 --> 00:11:33.020
and they can never give
any happiness to anyone.

00:11:33.036 --> 00:11:39.874
Labour people think that they are hurt by the
elites, or by the rich or the upper class.

00:11:39.879 --> 00:11:42.084
But what are they aspiring to be?

00:11:42.111 --> 00:11:45.944
They're aspiring to be the rich people themselves!

00:11:48.845 --> 00:11:51.515
They are hurt by the rich
and they want to be the rich.

00:11:51.515 --> 00:11:55.495
It would be like, if you were hurt by
somebody's shoes, you become the shoe itself.

00:11:57.322 --> 00:12:00.092
It you are hurt by the rich people,
then why do you want to be rich?

00:12:00.092 --> 00:12:07.001
It's a simple question. For a person like me
who has no materialism, I cannot understand it.

00:12:07.001 --> 00:12:11.022
Shri Mataji can I say something
about our political system?

00:12:13.612 --> 00:12:14.422
Yes.

00:12:14.497 --> 00:12:18.157
It was set up on the threes gunas,
you have radicals who are Rajas,

00:12:18.182 --> 00:12:26.386
Conservatives who are Tamas and you have in the middle the Liberals who are Sattva, intelligence. And what you are saying is right....

00:12:26.398 --> 00:12:30.718
But I tell you Liberals also need
Realisation! They are to be reborn.

00:12:30.718 --> 00:12:35.448
Otherwise you will have one horrible Jeremy
Thorpe. Why did you give him anywhere a seat?

00:12:35.452 --> 00:12:40.868
You gave him a seat. Why should you give a seat? You
should have courage to say, "Better not be there."

00:12:40.877 --> 00:12:42.298
He has got a seat!

00:12:42.298 --> 00:12:45.007
He is going back for it.

00:12:45.021 --> 00:12:46.358
Ahh?

00:12:46.377 --> 00:12:49.768
He's going back to his seat. He's
standing for his seat again.

00:12:49.798 --> 00:12:52.488
But what I'm saying......

00:12:55.451 --> 00:12:59.028
No, no, but it's only after you see?  But I tell you what.

00:12:59.028 --> 00:13:04.171
You see, unless and until they take
to realisation, it will not work.

00:13:04.231 --> 00:13:07.861
I told David Steel about Mataji,
I told David Steel about Mataji.

00:13:07.877 --> 00:13:13.411
You see, what I'm saying: just by proposing
that you are in the centre, you do not become.

00:13:13.454 --> 00:13:17.952
"Sahaja, Sahaja," you see, Kabira has
said it: "Sahaja, Sahaja, saba karata."

00:13:17.959 --> 00:13:22.345
"They all say Sahaja, Sahaja, but they are not!"

00:13:22.395 --> 00:13:26.692
You should be ashamed of such a
horrible leader you had for so many days.

00:13:26.735 --> 00:13:31.202
Jeremy Thorpe? Well he's
better than some we've had.

00:13:31.208 --> 00:13:37.448
No, no horrible he is! You just see
vibrations. Horrible person he is!

00:13:37.482 --> 00:13:38.488
No!

00:13:38.532 --> 00:13:40.388
No, no, no, all of them are just the same.

00:13:40.388 --> 00:13:45.406
To me all of them are just the same. There is
nothing to choose. But if you have a choice...

00:13:45.406 --> 00:13:52.926
You see, England: we aren't an aggressive nation and I
don't like you saying that we are an aggressive nation!

00:13:52.911 --> 00:13:58.526
No, no. You are not aggressive
when it comes to something else.

00:13:58.526 --> 00:14:01.026
But when it comes to cultures, you do like this.

00:14:01.026 --> 00:14:05.823
Well we are uneducated, I admit. When we came
to India we didn't know what we were doing,

00:14:05.823 --> 00:14:09.283
so we cut off from it and we wouldn't
have anything to do with it.

00:14:09.303 --> 00:14:16.052
What English brought from India?  Pyjamas!  Jodhpurs! Verandahs!

00:14:16.143 --> 00:14:17.212
The sun dial!

00:14:17.212 --> 00:14:21.352
And what else did you buy? So, you
are aggressive that way. You see?

00:14:21.352 --> 00:14:22.912
So all these things have to be changed.

00:14:22.912 --> 00:14:27.116
Like Indians must change and they should
not accept whatever you give them.

00:14:27.853 --> 00:14:34.993
Our aim of being in India was not an
aggressive one. And we weren't aggressive!

00:14:35.019 --> 00:14:35.573
In India?

00:14:35.573 --> 00:14:38.573
I don't like hearing these things!

00:14:38.584 --> 00:14:44.203
You may not like it, but we have had it!! You see , you
don't know how they treated us. You have no idea Simon.

00:14:44.253 --> 00:14:47.251
When I go to India, why do they say, Victoria Rani?"

00:14:50.706 --> 00:14:55.006
I want to know why in India they
say, "Oh we want Rani back."

00:14:55.056 --> 00:14:58.330
Arey! If you pay money to someone!

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:02.970
Well I've met Indians who like Germans for kicking
us out, because without the second world war....

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:07.818
No, no, I'll tell you very simple.
Just Simon, Simon. Listen, listen.

00:15:07.873 --> 00:15:13.558
I shall tell you. You will understand if you listen Very simple.
It is very simple. It's a poor country.

00:15:13.614 --> 00:15:20.644
You gave them money, they can sell you anything. They have kitaabs and they gave these... we never had these...

00:15:20.644 --> 00:15:27.546
Like they called somebody..  What do you
call that? All these M.A.D PhD's and all that,

00:15:27.573 --> 00:15:32.486
Ahh.... Titles! They gave titles and
they gave this and that.

00:15:32.511 --> 00:15:38.580
You know, English know how to do it. And they
collected some people to say something about it.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:42.671
But the way they had to fight it out, you don't
know. You don't know. You were not there.

00:15:42.726 --> 00:15:45.226
Have you seen Satyajit Ray's
film 'The Chess Players?'

00:15:45.226 --> 00:15:49.867
Have you seen Satya Ray's...? Satyajit
Ray is the best filmmaker in India.

00:15:49.902 --> 00:15:54.807
That's what you people think, because
he tells all about our poverty!

00:15:54.843 --> 00:15:58.183
He doesn't know anything about
Indian culture, not a word.

00:15:58.183 --> 00:16:01.223
He doesn't know anything about
spirituality; Satyaji Ray.

00:16:01.223 --> 00:16:06.433
He's alright, people like him because
he sings the saga of communism.

00:16:06.474 --> 00:16:11.114
That's why people like him. That's
not India! He never represents India.

00:16:11.149 --> 00:16:18.144
It's alright, he is very good at getting very old people
from somewhere showing all their ribs and stomachs.

00:16:20.434 --> 00:16:29.867
That's how he does and people like it, because there is a kind of sadism; we like to see the poverty.  We like to see some people being tortured, because we feel we are tortured.

00:16:29.937 --> 00:16:34.287
It's very subtle Simon, I tell you. You are
a different person. You cannot understand it.

00:16:35.259 --> 00:16:37.359
But now you are different.

00:16:37.359 --> 00:16:42.579
I'm not talking about the people who came to India,
but I am saying today also as the Western mind is.

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:51.728
You see with your rationality, with your so called scholarship, that you have

00:16:51.768 --> 00:16:55.778
the so called, we can say industrial...

00:16:55.809 --> 00:17:02.049
Indians these days go overboard for
Bertrand Russell... Lichtenstein.. and

00:17:02.059 --> 00:17:03.299
That's what I'm saying.

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:07.479
You see, this is what I'm saying! The same thing
as you are saying, I am saying the same thing.

00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:13.102
You are giving them and they are taking
it, whether it is poison or anything.

00:17:13.159 --> 00:17:15.982
This is what I am saying. They
are another kind of fool.

00:17:15.989 --> 00:17:18.489
You are one type, they are another type.

00:17:18.489 --> 00:17:20.989
You see, you aggress them and they take it.

00:17:20.989 --> 00:17:23.489
If anything goes from
India, they will accept it.

00:17:26.199 --> 00:17:30.639
If anything goes from England, they will
accept it! It's a funny thing going on.

00:17:30.676 --> 00:17:32.099
But we get all these fake gurus, who've come from India.

00:17:32.139 --> 00:17:37.059
Yes that is what I'm saying. You take
from them, they are another sect.

00:17:37.099 --> 00:17:39.599
They are sending some gurus
for you. You accept them!

00:17:39.599 --> 00:17:46.929
And this is the mutual understanding going
on. There's a big fraternity of thugs.

00:17:46.952 --> 00:17:50.959
After all, you built a fantastic
Wembley building for them.

00:17:52.257 --> 00:17:58.067
See now! You see the joke. Whole thing! Once you say
that, "We are the British." You are gone. Finished there!

00:17:58.069 --> 00:18:01.497
You just say, "We are human beings,"
and then you can see the whole joke.

00:18:01.497 --> 00:18:04.947
If I say, "I am an Indian," I'm gone, finished.

00:18:04.947 --> 00:18:06.720
It's not a political thing.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.587
See, it's not politically. It's much higher.

00:18:08.577 --> 00:18:12.897
You see, you don't identify yourself with
any group and then you can see the joke.

00:18:12.922 --> 00:18:15.137
If you identify, then you cannot.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:21.372
You don't have to take it literally. You have to
take the essence of what Shri Mataji is saying.

00:18:21.418 --> 00:18:22.662
If you listen, take the essence.

00:18:22.662 --> 00:18:26.812
No, no, no! If you listen to me, the whole thing you will
understand it, very clearly, what I am trying to say.

00:18:26.812 --> 00:18:32.922
Don't get angry! When I am saying
aggression is there. Aggression is the...

00:18:32.959 --> 00:18:40.865
You see, what I do not understand
that people do not study others

00:18:40.865 --> 00:18:47.618
and just bring about your own ideas
onto another, That's great aggression.

00:18:47.618 --> 00:18:52.454
Now, in my own house, my two daughters are
there. I have not told them  what is kundalini!

00:18:52.514 --> 00:18:54.524
Can you believe it?

00:18:56.411 --> 00:18:59.482
Can you believe it?

00:18:59.532 --> 00:19:05.202
Even not told them what is kundalini,
leave alone giving Realisation.

00:19:05.202 --> 00:19:06.532
Same with my husband!

00:19:06.525 --> 00:19:11.109
If they do not want it, I am not going
to agress. This is non aggression.

00:19:16.277 --> 00:19:18.777
But that doesn't mean I
accept aggression from them.

00:19:21.094 --> 00:19:26.425
So when you accept aggression is the same
as to give aggression, if you do aggression

00:19:26.432 --> 00:19:29.845
For me both things are just the same.

00:19:29.872 --> 00:19:33.355
So when we have to change ourselves,
we should say,"What do we do?"

00:19:36.884 --> 00:19:41.307
"Where are we?" "Are we aggressing
others or are we taking aggression?"

00:19:41.307 --> 00:19:44.327
Now, say Atul feels guilty, then
he's taking in aggression.

00:19:46.528 --> 00:19:51.408
If you feel like egotistical way that, "This is wrong.
That is wrong" Then you are aggressing others.

00:19:51.443 --> 00:19:59.233
All these things must be seen in it's full context and in
the full view of the whole thing, so you will understand.

00:19:59.233 --> 00:20:03.283
But what happens? We identify
ourselves with one part of life.

00:20:03.327 --> 00:20:08.557
We say, "This is the thing." And either we
aggress others in that case or we take aggression.

00:20:08.569 --> 00:20:12.317
This is sickness.  This is the sign of sickness.

00:20:12.338 --> 00:20:14.597
Anytime this happens, sickness starts.

00:20:14.597 --> 00:20:20.250
And this is the cause of sickness of
all the human beings all over the world.

00:20:24.075 --> 00:20:30.472
But once you identify yourself with the whole, then
you start seeing the whole thing as a diseased thing.

00:20:30.492 --> 00:20:34.112
And then you feel... treating
that disease as a doctor

00:20:34.136 --> 00:20:37.512
Then you do not identify
yourself with any sickness.

00:20:38.756 --> 00:20:43.316
Alright? That is what means 'Sahaja' life is.

00:20:43.356 --> 00:20:45.856
So now, if you have somebody sick...

00:20:45.856 --> 00:20:49.846
Alright, so now you understand,

00:20:49.886 --> 00:20:52.386
that by helping that particular person...

00:20:52.419 --> 00:20:57.310
Of course, it is your desire it will be
done, because you are one with the whole.

00:20:57.341 --> 00:21:02.401
But the approach towards that sickness is different.

00:21:02.441 --> 00:21:04.311
Do you understand my point?

00:21:04.311 --> 00:21:07.931
It's one way to help because he's
sick, he's poor, is different.

00:21:07.994 --> 00:21:13.878
What I'm saying: the approach should be that
we become absolutely confident of Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:13.878 --> 00:21:17.384
We establish our own powers. Absolutely!

00:21:17.384 --> 00:21:20.954
And then we make them the same,
because they will fall sick.

00:21:21.017 --> 00:21:25.107
They'll have all problems, unless
and until they are alright.

00:21:25.121 --> 00:21:29.237
So that is the primary thing that must be done.

00:21:31.253 --> 00:21:33.647
Because,

00:21:33.677 --> 00:21:36.952
on one side they are the
people whose ego is hurt.

00:21:36.952 --> 00:21:41.317
the other side are the people who
have been suffering from their egos.

00:21:41.355 --> 00:21:44.973
If you have to help both of them,
you have to bring them in the centre.

00:21:44.983 --> 00:21:47.363
Alright? Do you understand my point now?

00:21:47.393 --> 00:21:52.653
Now, to bring them in the centre
is not to sort of appease them

00:21:52.713 --> 00:21:56.513
Not that way. But by
developing the centre.

00:21:56.563 --> 00:22:03.437
You see, let the centre grow first, on both the sides,
so it engulfs all that. Do you understand Maria?

00:22:03.485 --> 00:22:05.985
Yes, Mother.

00:22:07.649 --> 00:22:12.178
They will never believe in God, because
that is the way they can assert their ego.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:21.508
Indians are another set of fools, absolutely set of
fools, because the way they're following you people.

00:22:21.508 --> 00:22:24.998
I mean you are already in the
ditch, where are they going?

00:22:27.321 --> 00:22:32.620
Firstly they do not have any values about
honesty about them. That's finished.

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:38.620
Now, even if they are getting the other values also from
you, then these sickly people, where will they be?

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:40.320
As it is they are theives.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:45.500
When a thief becomes an immoral
person, now what will happen to him?

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:51.050
It's like somebody has
been bitten by a scorpion

00:22:51.059 --> 00:22:57.388
and on top of that he takes wine,
then what happens to such a person?

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:05.600
So the aggression is within,
which is to be corrected.

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:12.400
For all Realised Souls, it is important to
see if we are taking any aggression within us

00:23:12.418 --> 00:23:15.370
is equally wrong as giving aggression.

00:23:19.651 --> 00:23:34.994
You see, we have to develop a set of people who have idea
of 'Reality,' those who understand what is 'Reality.'

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:43.525
Those who are going to set in another type of
way, which will cut down this vicious circle.

00:23:45.842 --> 00:23:56.053
We have to have that kind of mind, by which we see
the disease of the whole and try to correct it.

00:23:58.803 --> 00:24:01.994
That's how we can manage.

00:24:02.034 --> 00:24:07.514
but if you start identifying, even today I would
say, with any one of them, you are mistaken.

00:24:07.524 --> 00:24:09.404
Now you understand my point?

00:24:09.437 --> 00:24:12.404
You just don't identify with any one of them!

00:24:13.874 --> 00:24:20.240
You have to identify yourself with 'Reality,' with
your 'Self.' To begin with! When you become that...

00:24:20.261 --> 00:24:21.490
Nirguna!

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:23.950
Not necessarily nirguna!

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:28.050
You start with saguna only. Because
I am in saguna, what to do?

00:24:29.314 --> 00:24:32.430
If you do not come in
saguna... saguna is 'with forms.'

00:24:32.464 --> 00:24:35.554
If you do not come in the form, nobody
understands, who will talk to you?

00:24:35.554 --> 00:24:38.054
A Nirguna cannot talk to you.

00:24:45.009 --> 00:24:47.509
So the Saguna had to come.Alright!

00:24:47.509 --> 00:24:54.724
Now you establish within yourself the
complete understanding of the saguna.

00:24:58.012 --> 00:25:03.276
Now don't doubt too much. If you are a doubting Thomas,
you will end up with zero! I can tell you this much.

00:25:03.326 --> 00:25:08.899
We have had people for years together. There is one gentleman coming for seven years and you know him, and nothing could be done.

00:25:08.946 --> 00:25:11.629
And he supposed to be a wrangler in mathematics!

00:25:15.329 --> 00:25:21.889
So, you must see the people who have understood
the saguna and how far they have gone.

00:25:21.889 --> 00:25:27.029
And if you are to progress, you try
to understand it now, first of all.

00:25:29.053 --> 00:25:31.553
Secondly, you must also understand,

00:25:31.553 --> 00:25:40.046
that you are going to be the people who are going
to lead the whole world into a new awareness,

00:25:40.046 --> 00:25:43.371
into a new life, into a new dimension!

00:25:46.971 --> 00:25:51.398
So don't identify with people who
are still blind, who do not see.

00:25:54.438 --> 00:25:56.938
They'll make you more blind.

00:25:58.738 --> 00:26:02.997
Identify yourself with people
who have seen something.

00:26:06.374 --> 00:26:09.453
The ones who have had
experiences, you identify.

00:26:09.494 --> 00:26:12.703
Put your attention to them,
then only you can see.

00:26:18.168 --> 00:26:23.118
And that is only possible when you
start giving up your misidentifications.

00:26:30.792 --> 00:26:35.848
As long as you have
misidentifications, you will be mad!

00:26:35.879 --> 00:26:38.488
You would not know what to do about it.

00:26:38.516 --> 00:26:41.016
That's sickness!

00:26:41.996 --> 00:26:46.046
You got involved into these identifications gradually.

00:26:46.073 --> 00:26:52.196
You see, because the atmosphere is like
that, the whole surrounding is like that.

00:26:52.238 --> 00:26:55.743
From all sides you have
people who just engulfed you.

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:57.493
They club you into it!

00:26:57.493 --> 00:27:00.913
You have to jolly well come in
to it! Your freedom is cut off.

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:03.450
You are not free to think about it.

00:27:07.406 --> 00:27:10.823
And that's how you are not
free from misidentifications.

00:27:10.877 --> 00:27:18.772
To begin with you were alright, but gradually you started
getting enveloped and identified with your mistakes.

00:27:20.064 --> 00:27:23.214
How are you responsible for what your
forefathers have done in this country,

00:27:23.214 --> 00:27:25.714
or my forefathers have done in my country?

00:27:27.384 --> 00:27:32.094
Tell me. Who are they to you? They might have
been born in China now with chinky eyes.

00:27:36.342 --> 00:27:44.552
Or could be in Rye (?), or could be running
away with Amin as his soldiers. Could be anywhere!

00:27:44.583 --> 00:27:47.083
And we are not responsible for
them, whatever they have done.

00:27:47.083 --> 00:27:49.583
Alright?  Keep it at that point.

00:27:49.583 --> 00:27:59.287
Now, if you feel responsible, say even
for anyone who belongs to your tribe,

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:03.527
still it's wrong, because you are different people.

00:28:05.403 --> 00:28:15.284
When you become that, then you must identify yourself with the new tribe, one who has known 'Reality.'

00:28:19.813 --> 00:28:25.073
But human beings identify very easily
with something so much illusory:

00:28:25.073 --> 00:28:29.793
like if you are born in England you are English,
if you are born in India, you are Indian.

00:28:29.813 --> 00:28:32.313
You could have been born
in Singapore or any place!

00:28:35.845 --> 00:28:40.039
These all misidentifications create this problem in you.

00:28:40.057 --> 00:28:45.863
Then with this identifications also,
you go into that... complete circles.

00:28:45.913 --> 00:28:52.073
If you are an Indian, you start speaking
like an Indian: all the good and bad of it.

00:28:52.141 --> 00:28:56.719
Same with English, same with
French, same with everything.

00:28:56.738 --> 00:29:01.238
You see, gradually you start misidentification.
Missidentification starts working in you.

00:29:02.928 --> 00:29:08.514
But you are the pure thing inside.
These all impurities cover you.

00:29:08.521 --> 00:29:17.434
So to free yourself from all these impurities, of
any kind. I tell you this is like possession in you.

00:29:19.078 --> 00:29:26.698
To be free absolutely of all
these things is the ultimate aim.

00:29:30.263 --> 00:29:32.763
So, all these ideas, when they come into your head,

00:29:32.763 --> 00:29:41.693
please remember that all these have come to
us because we belong to a particular society,

00:29:41.736 --> 00:29:44.463
a particular caste or religion.

00:29:44.496 --> 00:29:50.473
Now, for example, the other day, you know, there was a
gentleman who said, "I feel very guilty all the time."

00:29:50.473 --> 00:29:52.973
So I said, "Are you a Catholic?" He said, "No."

00:29:52.973 --> 00:29:57.306
So I said, "You have no business to feel guilty!"

00:29:57.356 --> 00:30:01.726
Because if you are a Catholic, you
are made to feel guilty all the time.

00:30:03.127 --> 00:30:09.418
It's a collective you see. Just from childhood if somebody gets a brain wash all the time, a little child doesn't understand.

00:30:09.458 --> 00:30:13.288
You go on telling him, "You are a sinner." He said, "No?"

00:30:13.298 --> 00:30:15.748
You go on telling him, he'll say, "Am I a sinner?"

00:30:15.749 --> 00:30:20.379
Then he goes to church. Then they tell, "You are a sinner."

00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:22.839
You must confess.

00:30:22.917 --> 00:30:25.417
"Repent, repent repent!"

00:30:26.507 --> 00:30:29.007
Repent, repent. Now he says,
"What should I repent?"

00:30:29.007 --> 00:30:34.137
So he thinks about it, he goes to the priest
and he tells him that, "I repent for one thing."

00:30:34.147 --> 00:30:36.127
He said, "What?"

00:30:36.127 --> 00:30:38.627
"Because I opened the tap."

00:30:38.627 --> 00:30:44.599
He said, "What?" "I opened the tap and my
mother scolded me for that. I repent for that."

00:30:44.602 --> 00:30:51.009
So, it starts from there, you see, and
the whole thing starts working out.

00:30:51.036 --> 00:30:54.023
Then poor thing repents for something else.

00:30:54.053 --> 00:30:59.593
But inside, when he's repenting, he's building up a pouch.

00:31:01.973 --> 00:31:10.746
And that's how these horrible people, so called Christians
or so called Hindus, all of them just the same.

00:31:10.759 --> 00:31:14.961
But I am saying about these, how
they have gone against Christ.

00:31:14.961 --> 00:31:18.699
There's one thing he taught is non-aggression.

00:31:21.385 --> 00:31:24.499
You make somebody feel
guilty and you have it!

00:31:27.996 --> 00:31:30.038
Absolutely satanic!

00:31:30.038 --> 00:31:35.418
Is there any mention in the Bible, that
Christ wanted somebody to confess to him?

00:31:37.349 --> 00:31:39.849
Where did he mention by any chance.

00:31:39.849 --> 00:31:40.365
No.

00:31:40.365 --> 00:31:47.869
Then why these people have started this confession business? And who are they, compared to Christ, that they ask for confessions?

00:31:47.909 --> 00:31:55.865
Appointed by some theological college!  Elected by some people where the smoke comes out of the chimney!

00:31:58.997 --> 00:32:03.535
All of these silly things you
digest without thinking about it.

00:32:05.593 --> 00:32:10.193
and then you are misidentified also Maria. Alright?

00:32:10.219 --> 00:32:16.559
So you must understand. Be happy and joyous that
you have found the Eternal Life and be one with it.

00:32:17.368 --> 00:32:18.359
I will Mother.

00:32:18.359 --> 00:32:21.669
Alright. And you tell them off
that, "You are all silly fools.

00:32:21.771 --> 00:32:27.485
And you go ahead with your idiocity! And when
you are absolutely drowned, then come to us!"

00:32:27.522 --> 00:32:35.955
I used to do that until they strangled me. That's when
you found me Mother and you pulled me out of that.

00:32:35.955 --> 00:32:41.514
That's what I used to say to spiritualist.
I used to tell them what I thought of them.

00:32:41.537 --> 00:32:44.037
But why?  You see , a spiritualist whom are they?

00:32:44.037 --> 00:32:46.537
Do you know who indulges?
All these poor things.

00:32:47.987 --> 00:32:51.964
Same in India! They have all these horrible tantrikas, this, that.

00:32:51.964 --> 00:32:56.757
As long as we involve it... I you see
there are countries like, you can say

00:32:56.802 --> 00:32:59.927
aah, say aah,

00:32:59.942 --> 00:33:04.087
tantrikas are mostly prevalent in Bengal, in Bihar,

00:33:04.111 --> 00:33:12.831
in UP., in Kerala, in Madras, Assam.

00:33:12.864 --> 00:33:20.482
And there you find the poverty! And maximum
are in Bihar, which is the poorest of all!

00:33:24.362 --> 00:33:32.042
I mean the absurdity of these people: that
place that we went to, Kovalam, is in Kerala.

00:33:32.121 --> 00:33:37.672
The people are extremely poor and
for the newspaper people, you see,

00:33:37.672 --> 00:33:40.172
this is the main issue they have; that poverty.

00:33:40.172 --> 00:33:45.130
They want to sort of take advantage of their
poverty. As if they are very poor, live like poor.

00:33:46.181 --> 00:33:51.188
And these people arranged my programme in a hall,
a big hall and it was a carpet or something,

00:33:51.188 --> 00:33:52.378
I don't know what it is.

00:33:52.378 --> 00:33:56.838
So they published that she was living
in suites of rooms with.. what is it?

00:33:56.858 --> 00:33:57.378
Wall to wall

00:33:57.378 --> 00:33:59.878
wall to wall carpet and
this nonsense, you see!

00:33:59.878 --> 00:34:02.950
I was, poor thing, living with these people!

00:34:02.938 --> 00:34:08.950
But why? Because they wanted to imply that
she lives in luxury or whatever it is.

00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:13.030
I live always in luxury whether I am poor
or rich. Makes no difference to me.

00:34:13.061 --> 00:34:19.007
So, this is what is the accent they had. But
why there is poverty, why don't they think?

00:34:19.007 --> 00:34:22.801
Do you know, in that country,
such a wretched condition is,

00:34:22.841 --> 00:34:27.831
that Shri Shankaracharya
was born in that country,

00:34:27.864 --> 00:34:32.591
and these people told me that,
"We do not know who he was

00:34:32.634 --> 00:34:35.494
and also we do not know that
he was born in this country."

00:34:35.514 --> 00:34:38.014
They should be ashamed of themselves!

00:34:38.984 --> 00:34:41.484
And the second thing that they did

00:34:41.484 --> 00:34:43.984
that they tortured him

00:34:43.984 --> 00:34:46.484
because when he came back,
when his mother was sick,

00:34:46.484 --> 00:34:48.426
they would no even give him water.

00:34:48.426 --> 00:34:52.356
They said, "You are a sanyasi, you have no
business to come here, to your mother."

00:34:52.356 --> 00:34:56.907
And they would not, when she
died, they would not burn her.

00:34:56.947 --> 00:35:03.157
So, he burnt her in the house itself and he used all these... aah

00:35:09.972 --> 00:35:15.902
Banana. Banana tree to burn her off... to burn her off.

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:22.681
And then he cursed that country that, "The way I have been...
I have burned my mother, you will be doing the same."

00:35:22.671 --> 00:35:28.040
So now they cannot burn. So what they do, they dig
the graves and put them just in front of their houses.

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:34.968
So imagine every house is hovered over by all
the thousands of horrible people who are dead!

00:35:35.068 --> 00:35:40.658
We went to one village and asked the
condition of the people. They all ran out!

00:35:40.635 --> 00:35:42.398
They said, "Oh God!"  Ask Rustom!

00:35:42.398 --> 00:35:44.898
They said, "Mother, what sort of village is this?"

00:35:46.328 --> 00:35:51.045
And then you talk of emancipating
these horrible, nonsensical people!

00:35:54.449 --> 00:35:56.949
Why should God do that?

00:35:59.449 --> 00:36:01.949
They want to run after the tantrikas.

00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:12.289
Then the bhoots come in and how can you
have your problem of poverty solved?

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:18.119
Tell me any country where there are so many bhoots and there is riches.

00:36:18.129 --> 00:36:23.359
Always you'll find the poor people
indulging into it than the rich!

00:36:23.379 --> 00:36:26.959
And once the rich start indulging
into it you'll also become.

00:36:29.169 --> 00:36:31.439
It's a very simple thing.

00:36:31.439 --> 00:36:36.689
I can understand if you people do not know,
but Indians know this, but still they do it.

00:36:36.761 --> 00:36:43.121
that, if there is one bhoot coming inside your
house, all the Lakshmi will be destroyed.

00:36:43.152 --> 00:36:45.652
Everyone knows this, but
still they do it in India.

00:36:52.074 --> 00:36:57.052
There's no doubt Mother that the moment
you return to London the Left Agnya goes.

00:36:57.085 --> 00:37:01.522
And when you leave it you can feel it releasing.

00:37:01.522 --> 00:37:03.152
When I was in the plane I could feel...

00:37:03.192 --> 00:37:03.822
Ahh?

00:37:03.822 --> 00:37:08.542
When I was in the plane going to Germany I could feel
it release and when I was coming back it caught again.

00:37:08.577 --> 00:37:11.077
England is full of it.

00:37:11.077 --> 00:37:15.382
You see not use bringing up Labour
and Conservatives and all that.

00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:21.451
If they want to listen to me, destroy all these
tantrikas from here, one and all. You'll be alright.

00:37:21.485 --> 00:37:26.181
You try any trick.
You'll have problems.

00:37:28.021 --> 00:37:30.201
But who will listen to me?

00:37:30.221 --> 00:37:33.901
They used to believe in witches
and all that once upon a time.

00:37:33.921 --> 00:37:37.331
There used to be witch hunting and
all that, but they have stopped it.

00:37:37.392 --> 00:37:40.877
Now witches are very nicely
settled down in this country.

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:49.110
Many Christians are witches Mother.

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.660
Yes! So-called Christians!

00:37:51.704 --> 00:37:54.204
No, it doesn't mean that they are bad.

00:37:54.204 --> 00:38:00.752
They are not bad, but they are bad in a way,
because they bring all the bhoots from outside.

00:38:00.777 --> 00:38:06.607
No, they make the fields grow and we have to
keep witches here otherwise we'd get no harvest.

00:38:06.641 --> 00:38:13.337
Some bhoot is speaking through you. Some
bhoot is speaking through you, you know

00:38:13.377 --> 00:38:15.877
I'm sorry, but I...

00:38:15.877 --> 00:38:20.439
Simon, you are correct, but you see,there is a witch
in you that is speaking, you are not saying that.

00:38:20.449 --> 00:38:25.169
You see how can you say witches should be here when
I have just told you all about them, what they do.

00:38:25.186 --> 00:38:28.949
Do you want people to suffer from poverty?

00:38:28.994 --> 00:38:33.829
Suffer from all kinds of mental diseases
and troubles? We don't want them here.

00:38:41.773 --> 00:38:44.655
Do what you want. You do not know.

00:38:44.655 --> 00:38:47.605
First you find out what you
want, write it down and meditate.

00:38:47.605 --> 00:38:52.185
First of all you should get rid
of all these operations on you.

00:38:52.207 --> 00:38:54.707
See in your room itself, there's a problem;

00:38:54.707 --> 00:39:00.450
these witches are here around. All of
them are here. You must clear them.

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:04.110
They all have to get out from this country.

00:39:04.135 --> 00:39:06.790
If by my coming here, if I cannot do even that much,

00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:09.290
then what's the use of my coming here?

00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:14.889
But it you are identified with
them, then what can I do about it?

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:17.410
All the churches are doing that.

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:28.640
As I have told you already that this
confession business is very wrong.

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:36.700
Whatever is the problem of a particular country is
to be handled in that particular country, isn't it?

00:39:36.704 --> 00:39:38.662
In India also we have the same problem.

00:39:38.662 --> 00:39:46.882
But that's a very different type.  I mean it is not regarded... You see, because it is not an organised religion, so I can wipe it out better, but it is organised here.

00:39:46.882 --> 00:39:56.827
The Seven Day Adventist, these another horrible Pentecostals, they are organised, they are accepted by law. They are doing all these things here through law!

00:39:56.857 --> 00:40:03.190
Mother, don't you think when they give you a sense
of being guilty in Christianity and Catholic Church,

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:06.750
they're wanting at the same
time to increase their power?

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:09.250
Of course! It's a play! It's a play!

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:13.540
But only an intelligent
man can see that's true.

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:18.070
You make somebody feel very guilty,
that is how they brainwash you!

00:40:18.108 --> 00:40:22.410
It's only brain washing. As
Hitler could brainwash Germans.

00:40:22.449 --> 00:40:24.949
these people have also brainwashed you.

00:40:24.949 --> 00:40:27.449
In India, also they do the
same thing - brainwashing!

00:40:29.349 --> 00:40:31.849
They have done all kinds of brainwashing,

00:40:31.849 --> 00:40:38.859
but the only difference is this, that
the Western religions are all organised.

00:40:38.896 --> 00:40:41.396
So when they are organised they become firm

00:40:41.396 --> 00:40:47.466
and they have much more power than
a religion which is disorganised.

00:40:47.494 --> 00:40:49.994
You can hit them better!

00:40:49.994 --> 00:40:55.556
Now the priest here is so much respected! In India a
priest is not respected so much. Ask him, he is a Brahmin!

00:40:57.806 --> 00:41:00.306
You see if a priest comes into
your house we do not respect him.

00:41:00.306 --> 00:41:06.037
You see, he takes money, we know he takes money. We do
not respect him the way here the priest is respected.

00:41:06.053 --> 00:41:12.168
Because it is organised. They have made their
norms and things by church, making some respect.

00:41:13.381 --> 00:41:21.476
What is terrible they gave the religion: and during the Middle Age they give to the Western countries knowledge.

00:41:21.486 --> 00:41:22.866
religion and knowledge.

00:41:22.892 --> 00:41:26.286
They had incredible power.

00:41:26.318 --> 00:41:27.396
That's it!

00:41:27.402 --> 00:41:31.028
Because through the knowledge they
wanted to introduce the religion.

00:41:31.056 --> 00:41:33.556
And afterwards religion became to be knowledge.

00:41:35.366 --> 00:41:37.066
So the vicious circle starts.

00:41:37.066 --> 00:41:41.196
So you must decide it and you must give
up your misidentifications, first of all.

00:41:41.213 --> 00:41:45.833
Because all your diseases come
from your identifications.

00:41:45.839 --> 00:41:51.793
Alright? Say now you are Greek. Now Greeks also have
certain misidentifications, quite a lot of them.

00:41:51.835 --> 00:41:52.503
Many!

00:41:53.243 --> 00:41:58.283
So once you start becoming a Sahaja
Yogi or a universal personality,

00:41:58.283 --> 00:42:02.223
you just dissipate.  You do not pamper.

00:42:02.217 --> 00:42:04.883
But if you are a real Greek,

00:42:04.917 --> 00:42:06.083
I never did.

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:06.563
I know that.

00:42:06.563 --> 00:42:14.033
But if you are a real Greek, then you must tell all the other
Greeks also that, "This is what it is!" If you really love them.

00:42:14.097 --> 00:42:17.353
I will be really please to say that to my aunts.

00:42:19.963 --> 00:42:23.752
Your Aunt, I am not so much worried,
because that's an age now, they are gone.

00:42:23.796 --> 00:42:26.062
But what about the future that's coming up.

00:42:26.062 --> 00:42:31.932
Now the people who belong to such organised
religions, as they have, which has happened in India;

00:42:31.979 --> 00:42:34.744
(Unclear)

00:42:34.809 --> 00:42:40.777
in the same way it is going to happen here also, that they
are not going to believe in any religions whatsoever.

00:42:40.813 --> 00:42:45.853
The other side has started as you
said! They don't  believe in any God.

00:42:47.933 --> 00:42:49.713
I don't know what they need to find out.

00:42:49.743 --> 00:42:50.063
Ha?

00:42:50.103 --> 00:42:54.868
I don't really know what they need to find out.

00:42:54.909 --> 00:43:00.548
Nothing! You see, it's just a swing from one extreme
to another extreme. It's just extreme, that's all.

00:43:00.548 --> 00:43:03.048
There is no direction, there's no guidance.

00:43:03.048 --> 00:43:08.889
It's just a swing from believing into too
much, fanaticism, to another is non- belief!

00:43:08.918 --> 00:43:15.759
Or Sahaja Yoga is not like that at
all. Extremes, you know, extremes!

00:43:15.804 --> 00:43:19.975
so from one extreme and to another
extreme, they go just automatically.

00:43:20.016 --> 00:43:22.516
I mean it is absolutely inevitable.

00:43:24.407 --> 00:43:26.907
You have to stop in the centre.

00:43:26.907 --> 00:43:31.951
And those who are stopping must
grow, so they engulf all that.

00:43:32.012 --> 00:43:35.231
This is what I'm trying to tell you.  Alright?

00:43:36.884 --> 00:43:42.171
And then you'll start seeing them, then
you will know how horrible they are.

00:43:42.971 --> 00:43:44.059
It's very painful Mother.

00:43:44.059 --> 00:43:47.759
It's very painful to see how
horrible they are, it's true.

00:43:47.776 --> 00:43:49.699
We have to, of course, cure them.

00:43:49.726 --> 00:43:53.929
but first we should be alright, all of us
and we should pull all these things together.

00:43:53.929 --> 00:44:00.325
I don't know Mother, I've noticed that one of the way
that the negativity works is that it attacks people

00:44:00.338 --> 00:44:08.055
and then it makes you feel sorry for them and then it sucks all your energy, so that you have no chance to do any work for Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:08.099 --> 00:44:10.599
Like Rustom had this problem before,

00:44:10.599 --> 00:44:12.189
he was over sympathetic.

00:44:12.229 --> 00:44:17.159
If you have sympathies…if you see the meaning
’sympathy’ – it means ‘sharing pathos’.

00:44:17.159 --> 00:44:20.449
You share their pathos isn’t it!

00:44:20.502 --> 00:44:26.662
So this is also there. And now why, you see why I have
said this is that you have, in these Western countries,

00:44:26.755 --> 00:44:30.732
you have seen the aggression of your forefathers
so you are taking to the other courses.

00:44:30.732 --> 00:44:34.122
You are over-sympathetic.

00:44:34.162 --> 00:44:38.432
And that thing is going to
tell against you, absolutely.

00:44:39.569 --> 00:44:41.812
There is nothing to sympathise.

00:44:41.812 --> 00:44:46.912
There is to be so strong, that you
just solve the problems like that.

00:44:46.959 --> 00:44:49.459
Sitting down here you should
be able to solve the problem.

00:44:50.791 --> 00:44:52.451
So develop your powers.

00:44:52.451 --> 00:44:56.461
Alright Simon? That’s what it is.
You must develop your powers.

00:44:56.501 --> 00:45:04.324
And how will you develop them is by becoming
silent and silent within and seeing for yourself.

00:45:04.364 --> 00:45:06.864
You have to just assume!

00:45:06.894 --> 00:45:09.054
You have powers already.

00:45:09.054 --> 00:45:12.264
You have been enriched by all the Adi Shakti.

00:45:12.289 --> 00:45:14.789
Everything has been done for you.

00:45:14.789 --> 00:45:19.571
You’ve got it. You are already
empowered. Just use that.

00:45:23.248 --> 00:45:26.891
Can you doubt that you are not empowered?

00:45:30.518 --> 00:45:35.177
You already have got powers and also
most of you know what is to be done.

00:45:38.807 --> 00:45:42.397
You know what is this power to be used for.

00:45:42.447 --> 00:45:44.947
You have the knowledge as well.

00:45:47.709 --> 00:45:51.667
But only thing is to assume it! You have to assume.

00:45:51.783 --> 00:45:53.883
We need the wisdom as well.

00:45:53.883 --> 00:45:57.413
You have! You don’t need Maria.

00:45:57.413 --> 00:46:01.793
You have a lot of it. Only thing
is don’t sympathise with them.

00:46:01.863 --> 00:46:06.433
Just don’t worry about them.
They are foolish people.

00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:09.010
This is what I have been doing all the time.

00:46:09.010 --> 00:46:15.780
That’s not proper. You don’t waste your energy on
that, that’s why you have thinned down so much.

00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:21.630
There’s a saying in Urdu, “Kazidli
bidli ka shayed kya deshakte”

00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:25.270
they say, “Priest, why are you so sick?
Because you are worried about the whole world”!

00:46:25.317 --> 00:46:27.956
(Break in recording.)

00:46:29.649 --> 00:46:35.330
It’s only one second you need.
You just say, “Go away all of you!

00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:36.546
Go away!

00:46:41.743 --> 00:46:47.407
So, you see for... we had an example
of that in Bombay, in Delhi.

00:46:47.407 --> 00:46:50.796
We had those Ramkrishna
mission people. Just tell them!

00:46:52.586 --> 00:46:58.886
There was a lady who had cancer from the same
ashram and she said, “Why? I was doing upkar

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:02.806
I was helping others. I was looking after them.”

00:47:02.851 --> 00:47:05.811
I said, “Then why did you get cancer?”

00:47:05.811 --> 00:47:08.511
She said, “Now in my upkar  I’ve got it.”

00:47:08.511 --> 00:47:11.011
So I said, “You enjoy it now!”

00:47:12.665 --> 00:47:15.827
You have paid for it by doing upkar!

00:47:15.827 --> 00:47:25.024
Upkar is ... Upkar means in Hindi
.. doing it with our doing it

00:47:25.024 --> 00:47:31.304
You just do it, without doing it. You even do not know you are doing. It's so simple.  Alright?

00:47:31.304 --> 00:47:33.244
It becomes part of your inner religion.

00:47:33.244 --> 00:47:40.328
Yes, otherwise, you think you are doing something, that
means pride comes into you, and the whole thing is spoiled.

00:47:40.382 --> 00:47:45.401
But Mother, the more we surrender and the more
we have faith, the more it will be alright.

00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:51.551
Yes, it will be alright.You see, if you are alright, if
you are strong people, then the Virata becomes alright,

00:47:51.551 --> 00:47:56.951
the Primordial becomes alright,  if you become a strong body.

00:47:58.915 --> 00:48:01.415
If some part of the body is sick you can cure it.

00:48:03.155 --> 00:48:05.655
How many cells do you need to fight them? Not much.

00:48:14.515 --> 00:48:17.325
But we are the fighting
cells. We have to fight them.

00:48:17.325 --> 00:48:20.435
By not becoming identified with them.

00:48:20.455 --> 00:48:25.475
You see, you have to fight with them in
such a way that you do not weep for them.

00:48:25.511 --> 00:48:28.391
Means you are affected by them. No!

00:48:28.431 --> 00:48:30.931
You are detached.

00:48:30.931 --> 00:48:33.711
You just say, “You will be
alright,” and they will be alright.

00:48:33.711 --> 00:48:37.261
So much powers you
have! Do you know that?

00:48:37.301 --> 00:48:40.981
But once you start weeping for
them, the power is neutralised.

00:48:45.301 --> 00:48:49.291
It should be done without any guide, anything,
you just say, “Alright, you will be alright.”

00:48:49.291 --> 00:48:53.505
Which is all well and good. Otherwise
there is no question of prestige for us!

00:48:56.075 --> 00:49:08.213
If somebody is cured, well and good. We have
not taken everybody’s bond that we should do it.

00:49:09.983 --> 00:49:16.017
We’ll do if we want to. If we don’t want to we’ll
not do it. It’s in complete freedom that we do it.

00:49:16.017 --> 00:49:21.093
At least I do! It’s in absolute freedom,

00:49:21.107 --> 00:49:23.607
because if I want to do, I will
do; otherwise I will not do.

00:49:25.777 --> 00:49:28.277
In the same way you should be.

00:49:29.737 --> 00:49:38.918
So then the detachment comes you see. Complete freedom
is also complete detachment, and that is complete love.

00:49:38.978 --> 00:49:49.639
Sometimes Mother when I go to some place people say that they used to know me before feeling very much for them and showing it,

00:49:49.653 --> 00:49:56.613
and that, if through Sahaja Yoga you become
unfeeling…That’s how they interpret it, becoming unfeeling.

00:49:56.610 --> 00:50:01.083
Unfeeling? No you should say, “Now
I understand that what was lacking.

00:50:01.083 --> 00:50:04.283
And I have too much feeling for
you. You become Sahaja Yogis.”

00:50:04.283 --> 00:50:09.033
You see, they always depended on
you and you had to give them.

00:50:09.071 --> 00:50:12.983
Alright, now you should say,
“You also become givers now!

00:50:13.033 --> 00:50:15.976
Through Sahaja Yoga you
can become equal to me.

00:50:16.023 --> 00:50:18.296
I want you to become that.”

00:50:18.296 --> 00:50:24.216
You see, sitting down and weeping for somebody
is no good. And some people are like this also.

00:50:24.965 --> 00:50:26.826
They like the sympathy?

00:50:26.826 --> 00:50:29.326
You see, they  like the show of the thing.

00:50:32.506 --> 00:50:37.488
Say you go to a place and they say,
“Oh, have you seen? Is he with her?”

00:50:37.508 --> 00:50:40.419
All that should go away.

00:50:40.456 --> 00:50:47.159
Maria, for a person like me, I will just,
I may not even bother. Why should I?

00:50:47.187 --> 00:50:55.127
I’m not attached. But then, you see, people like it if
somebody comes and too much asks. That's not feeling!

00:50:55.147 --> 00:50:58.647
Feeling is when it is in pure detachment.

00:51:01.837 --> 00:51:07.861
You are not feelingless, you are not
emotionless, but you are emotion.

00:51:07.929 --> 00:51:10.429
You become the emotion.

00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:19.069
Emotion is identified with you completely.

00:51:19.134 --> 00:51:19.999
Do you understand?

00:51:20.039 --> 00:51:20.669
Yes

00:51:20.669 --> 00:51:23.169
You are the emotion.

00:51:23.239 --> 00:51:25.739
The complete ocean: ocean of emotion.

00:51:25.739 --> 00:51:27.589
You generate emotion!

00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:30.089
When you are with people they get into emotions.

00:51:30.089 --> 00:51:34.019
You can inspire emotions into them.

00:51:34.049 --> 00:51:39.406
But nobody’s emotion should affect
you, then only it is possible.

00:51:42.507 --> 00:51:46.286
Even the ocean cannot become like a pond.

00:51:46.336 --> 00:51:53.665
Do you remember Mother, in the letter, I wrote a
sentence that I have a little bit of a problem of work.

00:51:53.695 --> 00:51:55.895
This was the problem Mother.

00:51:55.895 --> 00:52:02.195
Although I put the people's names in a
bandhan and I would pray for them at home,

00:52:02.262 --> 00:52:07.535
at work I would be detached from their emotions and their problems

00:52:07.607 --> 00:52:14.952
and because of that they would be upset
why they could not attract my attention.

00:52:14.961 --> 00:52:20.322
You see, my attention was attracted but
not to the point to become part of it

00:52:20.349 --> 00:52:27.628
and that would upset them and that’s why I had the
problem because they sent very negative vibrations back

00:52:27.628 --> 00:52:33.187
which eventually I could not tolerate and feel..

00:52:33.218 --> 00:52:35.307
No, you should be tactful about it.

00:52:35.317 --> 00:52:38.807
You should be tactful. You should be tactful about them.

00:52:38.807 --> 00:52:45.807
That is not the thing. Only thing is, you see, even if you
bleed, it doesn’t matter as long as it doesn’t hurt you inside.

00:52:45.847 --> 00:52:48.347
If it’s all outside, it’s alright.

00:52:49.353 --> 00:52:55.273
Attention, when you give to somebody,
you should be fully attentive to yourself.

00:52:55.326 --> 00:53:01.413
But the attention Mother, that they needed
was a selfish one which I did not entertain.

00:53:01.413 --> 00:53:03.913
Don’t entertain them. You see,
what I am saying is that,

00:53:03.913 --> 00:53:11.003
as you are Realised you will be surprised that you are in
a different wavelength absolutely, on a different position.

00:53:11.033 --> 00:53:16.933
And it is going to be a little difficult to adjust
with others because they want you the same person.

00:53:16.984 --> 00:53:19.233
You cannot be the same. You are a different one.

00:53:19.259 --> 00:53:23.033
It was only that you could give them
something for the time being, that’s all.

00:53:23.130 --> 00:53:27.644
But now, they will know that you have curative
powers; you can cure them, you can do things.

00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:32.494
Your value will go up much more!

00:53:32.512 --> 00:53:36.414
So you need not try to worry about these things. Gradually they will accept you.

00:53:36.464 --> 00:53:38.964
Things have sorted themselves out.

00:53:38.964 --> 00:53:46.534
Yes, they will sort it out! There are thousands of people behind you! You don’t know there are chiranjeevas (eternal beings) there are great personalities behind you.

00:53:46.584 --> 00:53:49.084
So you just let go.

00:53:49.084 --> 00:53:56.568
And we are not to be guided by their norms, not by them. We
have to put our own norms because we are different people.

00:53:59.238 --> 00:54:03.268
But first have confidence in yourselves!  First thing!

00:54:11.403 --> 00:54:13.903
Are you better Atul now?

00:54:14.865 --> 00:54:18.245
Now, Simon how are you? Are you
feeling guilty about something?

00:54:18.705 --> 00:54:20.178
No.

00:54:22.476 --> 00:54:26.785
Now you don’t swing from one end to
another, just try to keep in the centre.

00:54:32.112 --> 00:54:37.528
You have read a lot and you know a lot,

00:54:37.561 --> 00:54:40.408
that’s called as dhyana. You have got dhyana.

00:54:40.506 --> 00:54:43.486
But you haven’t got bodha.

00:54:44.441 --> 00:54:45.406
Bodha.

00:54:45.406 --> 00:54:46.136
Oh Bodhi?

00:54:46.136 --> 00:54:47.966
Bodha

00:54:47.956 --> 00:54:53.256
Means your dhyana is not
enlightened as yet. Aright?

00:54:53.296 --> 00:55:00.557
Because one is ‘to know’, and the another is
‘to know that the knowledge is enlightened’.

00:55:00.604 --> 00:55:04.802
This is the difference
between the two. Alright?

00:55:04.802 --> 00:55:11.355
The other day Gavin asked me, “What is samadhi?”
So I told him, "It is enlightened awareness."

00:55:11.394 --> 00:55:17.305
Enlightened awareness. You are aware, but
you are not enlightened. Samadhi is that.

00:55:17.305 --> 00:55:25.914
So in Sahaja Yoga, first you get nirvichara samadhi
– that is thoughtless enlightened awareness.

00:55:25.964 --> 00:55:34.857
And secondly you get nirvikalpa samadhi –
that is doubtless enlightened awareness.

00:55:34.857 --> 00:55:40.731
So to go to doubtless condition
you must know to avoid doubts.

00:55:40.771 --> 00:55:44.407
You have to change your style of approach.

00:55:44.437 --> 00:55:50.017
You see, other things you might
have achieved through doubting,

00:55:50.037 --> 00:55:54.107
but Sahaja Yoga is achieved through resolve.

00:55:56.737 --> 00:55:59.300
You even have to pretend that
you don’t doubt to start with.

00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:05.897
You have to go on pretending with yourself. Tell your mind, “I
am not going to doubt.” Go on for a while. Then it works out.

00:56:05.897 --> 00:56:08.759
There’s nothing like the faith.

00:56:08.787 --> 00:56:11.287
Faith, I am saying, not
the blind faith but faith.

00:56:12.867 --> 00:56:17.659
You have got the vibrations
now. Now believe into them!

00:56:19.791 --> 00:56:22.052
That’s the only way!

00:56:24.522 --> 00:56:32.497
There’s no other way out I can tell you this much.
Those who have taken to doubting will never approach it.

00:56:34.316 --> 00:56:36.816
You’ll be thrown away all the time with doubts.

00:56:38.826 --> 00:56:42.776
And a time may come when my attention may
recede and you’ll drop out just like that.

00:56:42.818 --> 00:56:49.448
You just cannot do Sahaja Yoga like
that. But blind faith is not needed.

00:56:49.463 --> 00:56:51.553
First you feel the vibrations.

00:56:51.576 --> 00:56:53.918
You see for yourself.

00:56:53.988 --> 00:56:59.428
Either we absolutely have blind faith or we have
rationality. Can’t we be something in between?

00:57:02.863 --> 00:57:07.001
The people who are absolutely blind are useless.

00:57:07.045 --> 00:57:12.945
They might be saved because if they can ask questions to me
that, “Are you this? Are you that?” Then they can be saved.

00:57:12.945 --> 00:57:15.915
If they come to that point!

00:57:15.961 --> 00:57:20.145
But those who are rational, they can never come into it!

00:57:21.821 --> 00:57:29.527
Because it’s like jumping like a monkey, from one
branch to another branch. You can never land down.

00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:40.092
It’s only through faith, shraddha, through
surrendering, you are going to achieve that state.

00:57:45.022 --> 00:57:50.942
And then small ripples here and there,
nothing, is going to disturb you.

00:57:52.741 --> 00:58:08.032
You are going to enjoy that state within
yourself. Allow your faith to dissolve you.

00:58:08.071 --> 00:58:10.571
You know the time is very short.

00:58:10.571 --> 00:58:19.925
You’ve got your Realisation and you take so
much time after that to come up to that,

00:58:19.942 --> 00:58:23.955
and that time is very much lost. Why do it?

00:58:23.988 --> 00:58:30.262
Now you have seen people who have shraddha how
far they have gone, so why not follow them?

00:58:41.406 --> 00:58:43.906
So that is very important

00:58:43.906 --> 00:58:48.565
that, by doubting you are not
going to achieve anything!

00:58:51.564 --> 00:58:55.745
You’ll be tossing. But you are to really put…

00:58:55.849 --> 00:59:00.514
Big girls have gone out.

00:59:00.599 --> 00:59:05.054
The big girls have gone out to play, you
also go out and play with them, alright?

00:59:05.084 --> 00:59:05.944
OK.

00:59:05.954 --> 00:59:10.088
Alright. See, how confident!
Because they are innocent.

00:59:12.308 --> 00:59:15.288
They have faith in themselves.

00:59:18.350 --> 00:59:23.241
So stop your rationality. It is not going to take you anywhere!

00:59:30.141 --> 00:59:38.225
You have to learn to develop your shraddha. Even you get Realisation, you cure people, you do anything.

00:59:38.225 --> 00:59:40.725
We have an example of somebody you know of.

00:59:40.725 --> 00:59:48.484
His mother was cured just like that. He was cured just like
that. He got a job just like that. He got whatever he wanted,

00:59:48.534 --> 00:59:51.034
and then suddenly he drops out!

00:59:51.034 --> 00:59:53.534
Without any shraddha.

00:59:58.658 --> 01:00:01.158
So that is what it is.

01:00:05.258 --> 01:00:14.789
So many have done like that because if you do not have shraddha, you get tired of jumping from one to another.

01:00:14.849 --> 01:00:18.031
All the time you are doubting in
this. It’s just a mental feat.

01:00:18.031 --> 01:00:25.248
We like to do circus for a while, it’s alright, but forget it! Now jump into it and get it!

01:00:25.355 --> 01:00:27.855
Now what do you lose?

01:00:29.604 --> 01:00:32.104
You lose nothing!

01:00:32.954 --> 01:00:35.194
We lose ego.

01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:39.084
Ego. You lose your ego but you get your personality.

01:00:39.084 --> 01:00:42.584
What do you lose? Nothing.
You get all the powers.

01:00:43.716 --> 01:00:47.576
Now the time is too short and you
are taking too long to do it.

01:00:49.053 --> 01:00:55.896
And some of you will be tired, jumping like that all the time
with your doubts, this way, that way. And what are you doubting?

01:00:58.487 --> 01:01:00.987
It’s all free.

01:01:00.987 --> 01:01:05.325
You don’t have to do anything about it.

01:01:05.365 --> 01:01:07.865
And doubting people can be quite foolish.

01:01:07.865 --> 01:01:11.955
They doubt about every nonsensical
thing which has no meaning at all.

01:01:13.151 --> 01:01:16.829
They see things which do not exist

01:01:16.851 --> 01:01:25.911
because it’s just, you see, a habit, or you can say an indulgence; you can say an entertainment for people, to doubt into this. And then doubt.

01:01:25.975 --> 01:01:29.932
You see they are just jumping like monkeys.

01:01:29.992 --> 01:01:32.492
Stop that!

01:01:37.792 --> 01:01:47.259
Any one of you who goes down into shraddha and dissolves
becomes a great instrument in the hands of God!

01:01:53.611 --> 01:01:56.111
Even to say that, “I doubt,” is wrong.

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:03.390
These people think we are very honest
by saying, “I doubt. I doubt Mother.”

01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:06.540
Please give up such ‘honesties’!

01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:09.620
It’s absurd!

01:02:09.647 --> 01:02:14.380
This is ego which is making you
say these things that, “I doubt.”

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:20.526
Because by saying that, it exists and you feel you are very
honest. It’s not you are doubting, your ego is doubting.

01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:30.450
When you realise that, that your ego
is doubting, it will become easier.

01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:37.020
“It’s not I who is doubting,
it’s my ego which is doubting.

01:02:37.067 --> 01:02:40.210
Or maybe some possession
in me which is doubting.”

01:02:43.309 --> 01:02:47.960
“Am I playing into the hands of
some possession or my own ego?”

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.900
That’s what it is – hundred percent!

01:02:54.880 --> 01:03:00.362
Because those who have not doubted have gone
too far. You have seen people in India.

01:03:00.372 --> 01:03:03.195
You have seen Dhumal.

01:03:03.195 --> 01:03:05.482
He never doubted!

01:03:05.482 --> 01:03:13.767
His own brother, he was helped so much: he had no money to eat his food, he had gone to that condition because he had put a lot of money in a business which was failing.

01:03:13.799 --> 01:03:17.467
When he came to Sahaja Yoga his business
started earning just like that.

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:19.020
He became a moneyed man.

01:03:19.028 --> 01:03:25.670
His child was sick, he was cured. He was sick, he was cured.
His wife was sick with something incurable, she was cured.

01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:28.170
But still he was doubting.

01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:32.220
He started taking drinks after that.

01:03:32.243 --> 01:03:35.580
He never used to take drinks, after
doubting he started taking drinks.

01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:40.640
He did all that was prohibited in Sahaja Yoga just to prove his point.

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:43.200
And where is he now?

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:52.925
I would say, pay attention to
your Self and not to your doubts!

01:03:52.925 --> 01:03:58.666
The doubts are coming from some dark
corners of your mind which is with you.

01:03:58.725 --> 01:04:03.595
What are you going to lose is
the point you must look into.

01:04:03.635 --> 01:04:07.709
Sort it out there. What have others lost?

01:04:08.819 --> 01:04:11.319
They have gained.

01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:16.275
Those who have doubted have lost, lost time.

01:04:24.997 --> 01:04:29.647
So don’t waste your time in useless things.

01:04:32.152 --> 01:04:34.652
There’s nothing to doubt.

01:04:38.938 --> 01:04:43.680
Every word I say is
the truth and the truth.

01:04:47.770 --> 01:04:50.270
See the vibrations.

01:04:54.443 --> 01:04:58.140
You see! I have to boast.

01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:01.433
You see! Every word.

01:05:04.083 --> 01:05:06.583
So don’t doubt it!

01:05:06.583 --> 01:05:10.863
Just take it and take it and take it.

01:05:10.903 --> 01:05:14.401
I know all this myself.

01:05:14.423 --> 01:05:18.184
I am not going to achieve anything by telling you these things,

01:05:20.844 --> 01:05:29.241
except that you will know me and I will know you.

01:05:34.521 --> 01:05:39.831
You are not to lose anything. You have to gain.

01:05:39.866 --> 01:05:45.994
So tell your mind to shut up for a while! It
is already running with a very fast speed.

01:05:59.838 --> 01:06:06.758
We want to get to that state of complete
doubtless awareness and, for that,

01:06:06.782 --> 01:06:12.642
are we going to carry these
doubts in our pockets?

01:06:12.668 --> 01:06:20.242
They have no meaning. They will all be neutralised. You have
seen people who have neutralised it. But those who do it…

01:06:23.688 --> 01:06:26.188
I have no word.

01:06:35.103 --> 01:06:37.603
Steady your shraddha. Steady it!

01:06:37.603 --> 01:06:42.453
It’s a force. It’s like a flame of a candle.

01:06:42.453 --> 01:06:44.953
Steady it!

01:06:45.277 --> 01:06:56.988
But by your doubts you are putting heavy pressure
on it and the flame, it has to face those doubts.

01:06:57.878 --> 01:07:00.378
You are weakening yourself!

01:07:16.098 --> 01:07:20.350
Simon you have to get well. You are a seeker for ages now.

01:07:20.347 --> 01:07:25.759
In many lives you have been seeking. And now you
are not going to play about anymore. Alright?

01:07:25.857 --> 01:07:31.079
You are going to be a certain
(unclear) . Absolutely, alright?

01:07:31.077 --> 01:07:33.577
Mataji may I go now?

01:07:34.457 --> 01:07:35.589
Alright. You may go.

01:07:35.629 --> 01:07:38.489
See you

01:07:38.519 --> 01:07:42.149
And you throw those away and bring
seven more [lemons] to me in my house.

01:07:42.149 --> 01:07:43.249
Tomorrow night?

01:07:43.299 --> 01:07:44.709
Tomorrow night.

01:07:44.749 --> 01:07:47.249
What time would you like me to turn up?

01:07:47.249 --> 01:07:51.199
Oh, any time from about five
onwards, that’s better. Alright?

01:07:51.199 --> 01:07:57.839
Five, six, anytime. Come to my house, bring them. And ask
Philippa to come and see me also tomorrow evening, if possible,

01:07:57.892 --> 01:08:01.429
because I’ll talk to her about
this, what is to be given.

01:08:01.484 --> 01:08:03.984
Seven chillies as well as seven lemons?

01:08:04.021 --> 01:08:09.609
Yes, yes. Alright? And as I love you, try to
love yourself. And now don’t get after yourself.

01:09:33.318 --> 01:09:40.418
One more thing I would like to tell you, because
there's time today, I can tell you about these things.

01:09:40.468 --> 01:09:45.978
for certain chakras how to clear
them, even physically you can try.

01:09:46.017 --> 01:09:49.346
One of them is of Vishuddhi chakra.

01:09:49.392 --> 01:09:56.029
Now for Vishuddhi chakra, I have told you many things
but you can try one more thing which will help you.

01:09:56.045 --> 01:10:00.149
Is to put your head on the ground like this,

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:04.709
near a bed, with your feet on the bed, resting on the bed.

01:10:04.753 --> 01:10:10.720
And try to come on the bed more and more,

01:10:11.953 --> 01:10:13.589
more and more.

01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:18.184
The body... push it on the bed so the whole pressure comes up here.

01:10:18.235 --> 01:10:21.744
Alright. And then keep my photograph handy.

01:10:21.777 --> 01:10:29.323
In that stage you see my photograph.
It will improve your Vishuddhis.

01:10:29.343 --> 01:10:32.832
In that case, in case you have Left Vishuddhi,

01:10:32.872 --> 01:10:38.392
then you turn your face towards the right and see it.

01:10:38.475 --> 01:10:42.831
If you have the Right Vishuddhi then turn
your face to the left and see my photograph.

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:48.713
That will help you because all of you have
Vishuddhi problem. This will be of help.

01:10:48.735 --> 01:10:51.783
You mean the neck on the floor?

01:10:51.782 --> 01:10:54.282
On the floor if you lie down.

01:10:54.292 --> 01:11:03.802
Now just lie down now, facing that side
towards the…yes, now go ahead, like that.

01:11:03.821 --> 01:11:09.405
Gavin be careful. Now, go down. You go down, and more, more.

01:11:09.435 --> 01:11:13.345
Again try to bring this lower portion on top.

01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:15.880
Bring the body straight.

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:21.860
Yes. So that there isn’t much of a Hatha Yoga.

01:11:21.925 --> 01:11:24.425
Can you see? Yes.

01:11:25.912 --> 01:11:32.576
Do you rest the weight on your shoulders
or the head? Pressure on the neck?

01:11:32.695 --> 01:11:37.750
More on the Vishuddhi. Better now?

01:11:38.726 --> 01:11:43.152
Where do you have the photo if you’re not going to look at it?

01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:52.016
No, no. You have the photo whichever side you look.

01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:55.238
Yeah, I know. But if you’re not going
to look to the left or the right?

01:11:55.268 --> 01:12:00.941
You turn your photograph with you. You must look at the
photograph isn’t it? Because it helps your Agnya, always.

01:12:00.971 --> 01:12:04.464
You see, if your Agnya is kept clear then
it should be cleared out better, that's why.

01:12:04.454 --> 01:12:06.954
You see that's why you have to have a photograph,

01:12:06.954 --> 01:12:12.886
because your Agnya can be cleared out with that. Otherwise the Agnya is blocked. You see? Better?

01:12:12.903 --> 01:12:13.746
Hmmm. It’s very good.

01:12:13.746 --> 01:12:16.246
Very good!

01:12:17.596 --> 01:12:19.916
All of you should try this thing.

01:12:19.916 --> 01:12:24.524
I have told you about, for Swadishthana,
what should be done. That you remember?

01:12:24.557 --> 01:12:25.714
Should I show them?

01:12:25.714 --> 01:12:29.874
Yes show them what is to be done
for Swadishthana – physically.

01:12:35.368 --> 01:12:37.868
And you say the mantra?

01:12:38.748 --> 01:12:41.701
Yes you can say the mantra,
would be a good idea.

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:45.861
Now for people who have a problem of Mooladhara,

01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:55.977
or say those who cannot sit on the ground and sort of  thing:
for them, it’s to practice with both your legs like this.

01:12:56.007 --> 01:13:00.877
Put them like that, you too have the same problem.

01:13:00.877 --> 01:13:09.257
Put these two [feet] together like this. You see, you cannot stretch it much. Try to stretch it down (the knees) on to the ground!

01:13:09.287 --> 01:13:15.396
Try to, try to, as much as you can!
But, in one shot you cannot do it!

01:13:15.436 --> 01:13:16.768
You have to put your knees down?

01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:21.736
Yes. Put your knees down.
They must touch the ground.

01:13:21.770 --> 01:13:25.270
I can do perfectly, despite my fat!

01:13:29.684 --> 01:13:35.014
Try to raise it and push that down. Gradually you have to
do it. You’ll do it the bathroom, you will work it out.

01:13:35.014 --> 01:13:39.464
That’s very good. You lift this so
only your Mooladhara is touching.

01:13:45.984 --> 01:13:53.384
Try to put it further, further. Now try to do that -
further. That helps you see, that helps. Further up! No.

01:13:53.384 --> 01:14:01.544
No, no, put this together and move that! Just push that,
just feet. No, no feet! Spread  the feet .

01:14:01.584 --> 01:14:02.844
Feet apart.

01:14:02.872 --> 01:14:05.372
Now do as I tell you.

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:07.990
Where do you live?

01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:10.490
Wiltshire.

01:14:10.490 --> 01:14:13.799
Spread much more. Spread it much more

01:14:15.906 --> 01:14:18.406
That helps you see. That helps.

01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:22.960
First you do this exercise.

01:14:34.490 --> 01:14:36.990
It’s working out. It’s much better now.

01:14:43.887 --> 01:14:47.797
Gradually, you will see it will work
out, gradually. It's better now.

01:14:47.812 --> 01:14:50.602
You see gradually it will work out, gradually, if you do it.

01:14:50.602 --> 01:14:55.829
It’s good for Mooladhara. For all the people who
have mooladhara problem, this would be a good idea.

01:14:55.909 --> 01:14:58.959
So gradually we should see to different chakras.

01:15:00.449 --> 01:15:01.989
Now for the Hamsa.

01:15:02.008 --> 01:15:02.939
Which Chakra?

01:15:02.969 --> 01:15:05.297
Hamsa!

01:15:05.337 --> 01:15:11.697
You lie on your body like that on your stomach.

01:15:15.538 --> 01:15:16.857
Now come along!

01:15:16.857 --> 01:15:23.017
Put your these things, Mooladharas, here on the Hamsa,

01:15:23.037 --> 01:15:26.824
and now ask the Mother Earth to suck in your problems.

01:15:29.401 --> 01:15:32.190
But the pressure should be quite a lot on that.

01:15:45.473 --> 01:15:47.973
Now you move it.

01:15:57.913 --> 01:16:04.183
Better? You feel better? You can feel the
sensation at the bottom. Allow them to disappear.

01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:11.952
Here, even your pressure will go away from your…

01:16:12.006 --> 01:16:14.506
You’ll feel relieved from the pressure.
