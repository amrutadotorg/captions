00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.900
With this beginning we understand

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:11.060
that the great saints of Maharashtra in that time,

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.980
the greatest was Ganeshwara,

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.860
because He saw the future that's going to come

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.220
and He told people about you,

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.140
that the man of God will become prophets

00:00:21.353 --> 00:00:24.340
and they will have powers to make others prophets.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.260
Now we do not realize what are we when we become Sahaja Yogis.

00:00:30.694 --> 00:00:36.974
We become so much still worried about things which have no value.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.100
If you see in the ultimate

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.220
all the things have no value, because they are so temporary

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.900
and if you go on wasting your energy

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.700
about things that have no spiritual value,

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.060
that doesn't matter, you are going to waste your life,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.500
because now you are there what is described,

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.060
the oceans which are talking nectars, oceans of talking nectars,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.100
nectar, not the nectar that we understand,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.020
nectar of spiritual bliss.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.180
You are that and when you are that,

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.940
then what is expected of you about yourself, just find out.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.460
You just find out yourself reflect back

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.740
what is expected of me of myself?

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.900
What am I doing about it?

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.660
I am worried about this nonsense, that nonsense

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:42.100
and I am supposed to be the ocean of blissfull nectar.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:51.100
I am supposed to be the forrest of the Kalpatarus,

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.900
the trees that give the boon to the people,

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.540
huge big trees and then what am I doing?

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.180
My giving-capacity is so low, what do I give up?

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.220
I don't even have attention

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.980
that can absorb the energy of the Divine.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.020
The attention should be such

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.820
that I should be able to absorb the attention of the Divine.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.180
Instead of that my attention is on wrong things.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.380
And what am I doing?

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.140
What do I do about myself is that

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.580
I am not trying to manifest that special quallity,

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.220
the highest quallity, the one that I am.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.020
I am born after it, I have been born so many times,

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.420
I have been a saint, I have been going arround seeking God

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.620
I have been going arround and again when I am born in this life-time

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.460
for such a tremendous task again I am lost

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.740
with the same nonsense?

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.860
And still moving about with the same nonsense.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.460
If you understand that

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.180
then you will know that what importance it has today

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.260
on this day of our international seminar.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.420
Internationally you are all related to each other and to nobody.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.860
Internationally.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.940
You are all relations to each other.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:26.340
These are the relations which are relations of deep friendship.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.540
Friendship has no [inaudible], has no lust, no gread, nothing,

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.460
it's just friendship.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.460
Pure relationship and we are that because we have left ...

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.500
What is the matter with you, Madame?

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.180
Will you please go and - that side!

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.140
This is not to be done, [inaudible], please sit down!

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.780
Hello, get out! This is not to be done when I am speaking.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.420
What are you doing?

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.380
I just don't understand.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.740
Am I talking just a odd which has any meaning or not

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.420
in your hearts or I am just talking without a meaning?

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.460
Sometimes I don't understand if I am talking to real Sahaja Yogis

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.060
or I am talking to some walls here

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.860
that who are not bothered about what I am talking.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.580
Bring down to your attention

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.620
what am I saying. It is important.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.620
Otherwise how are you going to learn?

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.260
Where is your attention?

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.100
So it's all right to say that it is all love,

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.180
it's all affection, it's all goodness,

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.660
it's all very sweet thing, you see,

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.180
but you must know that you have to come up.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.300
These trees have come up after a great struggle,

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.980
against the whole atmosphere, against the whole surroundings.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.540
They have come up on their own,

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.180
except for the Mother Earth to [inaudible].

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:46.980
So you people must know that you all are here to come up,

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.420
to fight yourself, find out what's wrong with you.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.620
What is your attention first of all?

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.180
The attention has to move in such a manner

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.780
that outward you grow

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:12.380
and inward you hold fast to your Mother.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.780
With complete respect.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.740
Those who cannot do it are absolutely useless.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.460
If any tree doesn't try to hold fast this Mother Earth

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.660
it will fall out.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:30.300
I mean it is just what it is doing and for which it is rewarded.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.860
It's nothing to do with the Mother Earth.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.580
The Mother Earth has this speciality.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.460
[Here Mother speaks in Hindi]

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.460
This Mother Earth has this speciality

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.340
and if this Mother Earth

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:50.500
is not going to be linked by you, by your [inaudible].

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.260
Continious identification,

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:01.660
or you are going to fall out like a dead tree.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.300
So it is very important to understand that you are great,

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.180
no doubt, these trees are great,

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.780
they are forced through, they have come up

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:17.740
but where is your attention and what are you here for?

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.060
What is needed to stick in,

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:31.340
sticking to things which are against your growth?

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:38.340
Bothered about things which go against you all the time?

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:42.260
The first and foremost thing that goes against us

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.540
is our own nonsensical ego.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.460
You must understand this ego is the one,

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.660
is the greatest barriere within us

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.500
and we have to get out of it.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.220
The Kundalini has to rise like the tree has this [inaudible].

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:08.420
And the ego is the biggest, biggest hurdle for most of it.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.860
It appears in many ways,

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.260
we fight the Mother Earth which is giving you the source.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.620
You are the very [inaudible] of that Mother.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.100
She has created you, She has made you.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.500
Because of Her you have come up. You are fighting Her

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.020
[inaudible] Her, going against ...

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.260
This is your ego, how will you grow?

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:35.100
And once you start growing the sun can help you.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:41.060
The sky, everything can help you, the nature can help you,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.500
but you must have complete desire to rise

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.220
about your dwarvness,

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.700
about your selfishness,

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:57.540
about your conditionings and especially your ego.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.180
All this when we say that you are this,

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.780
there is no need to be puffed up,

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.860
you see, if I tell a little tree that you are going to be a big tree

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.580
it doesn't mean that it becomes a big tree.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:16.700
One has to become the big tree by pushing forward

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:26.900
and that quallity like Ganeshvara, like Tucarama, like Ramdas

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.140
you all have to become that qualility.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:35.980
They never saw Me, I just nurrished them, without [inaudible] Me,

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:42.220
but they nurrished theselves on their own virtues,

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.180
on their own qualilities, on their own greatness.

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.460
You have to be great like them.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:57.620
Instead of that if you live with false emotions about yourself,

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:05.780
artificial things, absurd ideas,

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.780
all nonsense that we have gathered through our [inaudible],

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:14.140
through our rationality, through our reading, through our Gurus

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:19.260
and through our own mental projections

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:24.860
are going to be extremely dangerous

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:28.060
for the growth of every individual Sahaja Yogi

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.620
and as a whole also it will effect.

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:35.300
So we have to take a vow

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:40.780
that we are going to behave in a manner

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:45.980
which beholds our advent and [inaudible]

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:51.580
our advent at this time which is being described

00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:01.060
and prophesized. Prophecy was made long time.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:13.300
If we understand that we have come on this Earth for that purpose

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:18.660
we'll really separate ourselves from all the rest of the nonsense

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:24.780
that goes on and try to rise towards the sky

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.140
as these trees have done.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:37.940
We should not follow any other Sahaja Yogi

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:43.740
in all anti-growth activities

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:48.740
and anyone who tries to create a kind of a group

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.340
or tries to impress you by saying

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.340
that he can teach you something higher, [inaudible]

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:58.020
all kinds of technices and this and that you have to do.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:04.140
First of all you must know that Sahaja Yoga is a growth within

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.500
and that growth expresses itself outsides.

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.340
So that within growth is to be done by you fully,

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.740
with full understanding.

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:17.420
Then I don't have to tell you about anyone

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:23.020
You won't will be volnerable to nonsensecall talk and jabbering.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.420
You have some people who are intellectuals.

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:31.980
Intellectuals have a bad habbit of intellectuallizing everything.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:36.420
Intellegence is nothing for God, because God has created it.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.940
So you have to see through that.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:43.220
There are some people who are very emotional

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.180
and try to express themselves emotional.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.420
You have to get out of those ideas

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.100
and you have to understand

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:56.660
that emotions can play a very dangerous role in life.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:03.420
Now we  have decided to have so many marriages in Bordi,

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.820
which is a very nice thing and auspicious thing.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.380
I am very happy about it,

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:10.460
that we are going to have so many marriages, it is auspicious,

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:16.740
because marriages are supported, blessed by God.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.500
Yours is special, because I am sitting here before you,

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.980
for these marriages.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.340
But don't make a fuzz out of the marriage.

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:32.700
Don't create a problem by becoming superficial about marriage.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.660
These are the marriages of Brahma-Eka

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:39.700
where one feels the one-ness of the spirit

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.380
of the all-pervading power.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:47.100
Try to know that these marriages are done among saints

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.020
and not among ordinary people.

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.940
Try to respect the inner quallity of a person.

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:59.220
If somebody is a Sahaja Yogi of high quallity that must be respected

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:04.740
and that must be done and not the outer quallities.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.820
The outward quallities are nonsensically.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.420
You must respect each other when you marry,

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:12.780
because you are all saints.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.820
You are saints of very high quallity, I have told you

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:20.260
and the potential is so great, which is allready described

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:26.620
that only your assumption can get you that way.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.100
The whole world is hoping to happen these things,

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.580
that they should get such people on this Earth,

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.140
so they are described.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:00.380
The whole world is watching your progress,

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.180
the whole world is expecting this to happen,

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:07.940
the whole world has allready pronounced it

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:10.620
and where are we?

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.580
Where are we? Our progress is so slow.

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.660
We are worried about stupid things,

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:20.060
material things, worldly things,

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:23.540
superficial things, artificial things.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:32.340
So one has to understand that you are here today

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:36.340
for this international seminar - promise Me.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.540
Everybody seems to be younger than Me in this group,

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:56.540
but you have to promise that Mother we'll work with the same zeal,

00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:01.580
with the same attention as You are

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.860
and try to settle ourselves

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.220
fight for yourselves within.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:13.820
We talk to much, talk to much, do nothing.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:18.780
Try to reserve your energy in that silent dignity.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:33.660
You must have full  ideas to what you are.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:37.420
You must understand, what have you been up to,

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:38.580
what have you done about it?

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.700
Talking, talking, talking -

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.420
that's not the way it is going to work out.

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:49.380
The atmosphere is nice, everything is fine,

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:58.860
the future seems very jubilant, everything is fine,

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:03.020
but the highest about everything is

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.180
the hope of your Mother

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:09.380
that you are going to emancipate the whole world.

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:14.540
Give attention to that!

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.780
Think about it, that you are going to do that.

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:25.700
You have to be them, walking, talking, moving

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:34.340
forrests of that divine love, that dambara pragnya.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:39.780
I hope you understand, today is a very important day,

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:47.420
I feel that if this holy session works out well

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:55.140
maybe we'll might achieve a lot next year.

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:25.380
Now so We have looked forward to a Puja today

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:30.100
and try to absorb.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.940
My chakras worked very hard

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:39.180
and actually I find it sometimes impossible to accept the Puja.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:46.140
Today is a Puja of a great day and a great time.

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:55.540
At this time a big resservoire has to be opened out,

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.500
but it is  to be channelized to people

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:04.260
and how can I channelize to people who are filled with vanity,

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:10.620
with stupidity or with small-mindedness?

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:20.340
We have to be large, huge, big-hearted, great people.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:25.660
We are all born again who were great today again,

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:30.500
but somehow you are still mixed up with your surrounding.

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.860
So try to understand your own importance

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.180
and the importance of the time.

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:43.220
Is to worship yourself, to worship, but to be worshippable.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:47.700
You all think that only by dressing up properly

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:51.860
or by pushing up any show like that

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:54.580
we become worshippable, but we do not.

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:59.220
We should be worshippable to ourselves,

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:05.580
to see that whatever we are doing it has that grace and beauty,

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.340
the love and the greatness

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.980
of the saints who are very great saints,

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:15.700
not ordinary but tremendous saints,

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:21.140
but it is been described actually

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:25.860
that Ganeshwara in this poem has really worshipped you.

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.020
I wish we had people like Ganeshwara,

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.540
but they are all inside My body.

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:38.060
You are all outside and whatever is said has to be fullfilled,

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:42.700
not only that, but whatever is said is the truth.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:46.180
For all these Pujas you must have that depth, that greatness

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:51.900
of those great saints who came on this Earth

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:55.540
who worked for you, created this atmosphere,

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:57.460
think of them, what they have done,

00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:02.140
they have fought, all the time, they were tortured,

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:04.900
they had none of these facilities as you have,

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:07.460
they had none of this enjoyment, nothing of that kind,

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:11.860
while you got it all, everything on the plate.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:17.460
So be deserving people, authorized people

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:19.900
and work it out in that way.

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:23.260
Otherwise this world we cannot change.

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:28.940
This Puja has a very special significance upon you

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:32.340
and has to be done by people

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:40.260
who know that they are these great personalities.

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:41.460
It has nothing to do

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:45.180
with your so called artificial positions in life

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:48.260
or anything that is outside,

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.660
is the inside.

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:58.420
In this seminar one should not talk too much about outside-things,

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:05.340
but just talk about God, about your Mother or about Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:07.940
Best thing is to talk about your Mother,

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:10.580
so you neutralize it [inaudible]

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:14.380
and it works out, it works out.

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:17.500
It is a simple thing one has to understand

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:21.820
that God has been so kind to you, so kind.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.900
You don't have to fight for your saintliness,

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.820
nothing, you are all brothers and sisters.

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:32.780
You are all here, so much close to them, you are not alone.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:40.460
You are so great that you can know what you are.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:46.780
Who told them, who looked after, who helped them?

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:52.660
Today you are just like V.I.P.s

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:56.580
So please try to understand

00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:00.180
that you have to have a very humble attitude

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:05.300
towards all these saints and towards Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:08.220
Try to absorb as much as possible.

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:09.980
be kind to yourself.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.300
May God bless you all.
