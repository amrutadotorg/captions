00:00:05.927 --> 00:00:11.154
Now the interest changes completely, and
you start really helping people

00:00:11.234 --> 00:00:17.039
and not feeling that you are helping them, not
at all.

00:00:17.258 --> 00:00:24.280
But the surrounding portion of that, which is the
void, is the best, which is affected by your awakening,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.000
that you become the virtue itself.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:38.988
Nobody has to tell you that you be virtuous, when
you are awakened you become a virtuous person,

00:00:39.125 --> 00:00:49.777
you enjoy your virtues, you enjoy being
good, you enjoy being nice, you really enjoy it.

00:00:49.857 --> 00:00:56.548
And that enjoyment comes to you as a blessing
because the virtue itself is so strengthening,

00:00:56.628 --> 00:01:06.909
so powerful that anyone who is harmed
or troubled or tortured or put down,

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:13.920
you stand up, you are not afraid of
anyone, you are not afraid of any one of them.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.425
Now about these people who have
been troubling you as fake gurus,

00:01:19.525 --> 00:01:23.759
I told about them in 1970. I'm just a lady.

00:01:23.839 --> 00:01:27.088
And single-handed I told them who these people are,

00:01:27.168 --> 00:01:30.711
how they are going to loot you,
and what they are going to do;

00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:37.529
but in this country nobody can think of one
genuine person who could be really genuine.

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:39.922
It was the problem that time,

00:01:40.002 --> 00:01:44.761
but with this awakening within you of the virtuous
nature,

00:01:44.841 --> 00:01:47.337
you just know what is virtue and what is not virtue.

00:01:47.417 --> 00:01:53.883
I don't have to tell you; I don't say “don't
do this, don't do that.” I never say that,

00:01:53.963 --> 00:02:00.160
it just happens, because when the virtue starts
developing, the vibrations improve

00:02:00.241 --> 00:02:03.944
and you feel extremely joyous.

00:02:04.024 --> 00:02:13.877
We have lost our virtues because 
there is no joy out of it, no reward.

00:02:13.957 --> 00:02:19.406
If somebody is honest, he has to suffer;
if somebody's good, he has to suffer;

00:02:19.486 --> 00:02:22.273
if somebody is kind, he thinks he has to suffer;

00:02:22.353 --> 00:02:26.195
but after getting Realization
you are rewarded for your virtues.

00:02:26.275 --> 00:02:30.504
You are amazed how you are paid for it, it’s
so surprising,

00:02:30.584 --> 00:02:35.000
like once there was a lady who came to see
Me, she was a refugee,

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.100
and I had a big house. So I said, 
“All right come and stay with Me.”

00:02:39.181 --> 00:02:42.848
So My husband, My brother they came, they
said, “What's this? You don't know her,

00:02:42.928 --> 00:02:47.439
who she is, her husband, whether he is her
husband or not, just given her two rooms. It's not good!”

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.047
I said, “Let it be, doesn’t matter. I know for
nothing is going to happen, let her be here.”

00:02:52.127 --> 00:02:55.620
So they wouldn't also go against Me. They
said, “All right, if you say so.”

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.363
This lady stayed for ten days and went away.

00:02:58.443 --> 00:03:01.855
Then she become a very well-known actress

00:03:01.936 --> 00:03:06.955
in India, I didn't know she was the same lady, but
somebody told Me that she is the same lady. I said, “Maybe.”

00:03:07.035 --> 00:03:11.286
Then one day you see, they wanted 
to make a film for our Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:11.367 --> 00:03:15.560
so they said, “We can ask this lady to act, 
because she is a good actress.”

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.696
I said, “All right, you can go ask but don't tell
her I am here, otherwise she will have no choice.

00:03:20.776 --> 00:03:23.095
I will not go and see her. You just ask her.”

00:03:23.176 --> 00:03:26.416
They went and ask her, they said, “Will
you be actress?” and all that.

00:03:26.497 --> 00:03:28.767
She said, “I'll try.” This, that she was
saying.

00:03:28.848 --> 00:03:33.454
But on the day on when they were going to open the
film I went there, she saw Me, she was so amazed,

00:03:33.534 --> 00:03:38.016
she said, “Oh God, You are the One,
You are the One Who is sponsoring this,

00:03:38.096 --> 00:03:42.184
Oh, I’ll give my life for Her!” She just came
forward, she said, “Have anything you like,

00:03:42.264 --> 00:03:47.484
I have nothing to say. I am so sorry
that you never told me that She's there.”

00:03:47.564 --> 00:03:52.973
Thousand times more she rewarded a little
thing I did for her.

00:03:53.053 --> 00:03:57.967
No more cheating, no more troubling, you become
a wonderful person

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.350
and so many people become your friends in this world.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.285
Your have to just tell you are coming, there
will hundred people at the airport to receive you.

00:04:06.365 --> 00:04:10.240
There will be so many friends all over
the world for you, you will be amazed.

00:04:10.338 --> 00:04:14.823
It's such a tremendous thing happens,
because now you all are awakened

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.723
in that Primordial Being and you have become
one with each other. You can feel it,

00:04:19.803 --> 00:04:25.537
that oneness, that unison that we are all not
only human beings but we are yogis,

00:04:25.617 --> 00:04:29.080
we are super human beings, and we have to look
after the whole world.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.196
That feeling of compassion is so overwhelming

00:04:34.296 --> 00:04:40.497
that all little, little stupid things
just fall off, there's no place for that.

00:04:40.578 --> 00:04:43.953
This actually happens and has happened with many.

00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:49.096
Dr. Warren, whom you have seen here, can tell you
as I have told you lots of stories, but there are many,

00:04:49.176 --> 00:04:53.600
some of them were so hot tempered,
some of them were so quarrelsome,

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.600
some them used to fight so much in the beginning
that I thought, “How are they going to be alright?”

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.401
But today I find them as great friends
and very great yogis.

00:05:03.481 --> 00:05:08.291
So this is the center where your religion is awakened.

00:05:08.371 --> 00:05:10.976
And what is a religion? Word comes from “religo,”

00:05:11.057 --> 00:05:18.317
in Sanskrit it means dharma, “Dhariyatisa Dharma,” the
sustenance, your sustenance, your valances is your religion.

00:05:18.397 --> 00:05:24.224
As every atom, carbon has four valences,
and in the same way you have ten valences,

00:05:24.304 --> 00:05:27.867
these are the ten commandments that were told to you

00:05:27.947 --> 00:05:34.891
and you become that, you just become. I don't
have to tell you as commandments

00:05:34.971 --> 00:05:38.959
but they become your beautiful ornaments within
yourself.

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:43.880
This happens automatically, so 
spontaneously you become that.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.400
A bishop came to see Me the other day, he
is a relation of Mine, My brother.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.948
He came to see Me, and he was rather adamant and
little angry when he came to see Me

00:05:55.028 --> 00:05:58.039
because he thought,
“Why am I trying to do this kind of thing?”

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.800
But when he saw the Sahaja Yogis he said,
“I'm amazed, you know,

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:07.715
I've been giving lectures in the church for years
together, but I could not achieve anything.

00:06:07.795 --> 00:06:10.400
How have You transformed these people?

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.520
The drug addicts have suddenly become such good people

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.240
that they have given up drugs, alcoholics
have given up alcohol.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.351
How is it without telling them anything?”

00:06:20.531 --> 00:06:26.101
I said, “Everything is within them. As soon 
as the light comes you can see everything.

00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:29.400
You know that this is on your way, this is
against your progress,

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:34.267
this is anti-life, you just give up. Only
thing you have to have the light within you.”

00:06:34.347 --> 00:06:38.960
So he himself was surprised at this and then
he said,

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.219
“Really, that should be done, is to transform them.”

00:06:42.299 --> 00:06:46.057
But I said, “You do not transform them by
giving them big sermons,

00:06:46.137 --> 00:06:51.674
you transform them by giving them the real second
birth, real baptism.”

00:06:51.754 --> 00:06:58.594
And I must say that Calvinist, of all the persons, Calvinist
in Geneva have accepted Me

00:06:58.674 --> 00:07:02.074
and they think that this is the
only way they can transform you.

00:07:02.154 --> 00:07:10.117
You will be amazed the Calvinist of all the
persons who are such I should say one-sided people,

00:07:10.203 --> 00:07:16.815
they have accepted to see the result of
everybody who is open-minded person,

00:07:16.896 --> 00:07:21.575
who thinks for the good of others and not for
money-making and for selfish ends.

00:07:21.655 --> 00:07:25.155
We'll see one day that this is the way it has to
be.

00:07:25.235 --> 00:07:28.920
God has given us this power, we have got a Spirit within us,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.418
we should try to awaken that and
we should accept it,

00:07:32.499 --> 00:07:35.731
not because I'm doing it, you can do it also.

00:07:35.823 --> 00:07:38.876
So this thing happens to you with this chakra.
