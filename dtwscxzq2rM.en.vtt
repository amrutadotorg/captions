00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:15.753
It was so very nice to come to Belgium and
have so many people for our program and I

00:00:15.753 --> 00:00:28.253
must say, now we are getting to people who
are very sensitive.

00:00:28.253 --> 00:00:50.313
[translation follows - yes] It is a .. it
is a new dimension I think, I feel, we are

00:00:50.313 --> 00:00:53.393
entering into.

00:00:53.393 --> 00:01:04.363
Because now we are really getting people who
are seriously interested in their realization

00:01:04.363 --> 00:01:10.732
and are very respectful.

00:01:10.732 --> 00:01:13.293
And that aggressiveness is much less.

00:01:13.293 --> 00:01:21.743
You don’t find anybody being aggressive.

00:01:21.743 --> 00:01:36.932
So we can say, that now the road is paved
for all of you to work it out in a Sahaj manner

00:01:36.932 --> 00:01:49.972
to bring them properly to Sahaja Yoga and
settle them nicely.

00:01:49.972 --> 00:01:57.743
Now this Sahaj manner should be understood.

00:01:57.743 --> 00:02:05.753
In a Sahaj manner, when they come to you,
you must know they are absolutely new to Sahaja

00:02:05.753 --> 00:02:09.403
Yoga.

00:02:09.403 --> 00:02:17.952
So first and foremost thing, you should not
talk about Me.

00:02:17.952 --> 00:02:34.713
You should not tell them anything about Me;
but you have to tell them about Sahaja Yoga

00:02:34.713 --> 00:02:38.743
and about yourself.

00:02:38.743 --> 00:02:44.672
Like you can say, “I had the same problem
as you have.”

00:02:44.672 --> 00:02:58.062
Or you can say that “See, it took me more
time then it

00:02:58.062 --> 00:02:59.103
took you.”

00:02:59.103 --> 00:03:04.443
It’s a little lie, but doesn’t matter.

00:03:04.443 --> 00:03:09.372
[Shri Mataji laughs.]

00:03:09.372 --> 00:03:19.862
You see, because first of all, you must understand
human beings.

00:03:19.862 --> 00:03:28.434
If you tell them directly “You are bad”
or “You are evil; you are bootish” then

00:03:28.434 --> 00:03:34.892
they will run away, though it is true.

00:03:34.892 --> 00:03:40.713
A lady from France came to see Me.

00:03:40.713 --> 00:03:50.613
She said that “They told me I’m evil.”

00:03:50.613 --> 00:03:52.473
So I said, “No, no you are not.

00:03:52.473 --> 00:03:54.803
Who told you that?”

00:03:54.803 --> 00:04:03.553
And gradually she improved.

00:04:03.553 --> 00:04:13.743
So you have to tell them that “You are the
Spirit” and whatever is hanging on to them

00:04:13.743 --> 00:04:30.003
will be dropped out
and will be cleared out by their Kundalini.

00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:42.043
So if that happens they feel happy and they
get their benevolence.

00:04:42.043 --> 00:04:49.992
It is how beautifully you handle another person.

00:04:49.992 --> 00:04:55.933
Now there maybe people who want to argue.

00:04:55.933 --> 00:05:03.203
With them you should say, “You know, you
cannot argue it out, because it is beyond

00:05:03.203 --> 00:05:11.453
human awareness.”

00:05:11.453 --> 00:05:19.383
And you better tell them that it is … “You
better take your Realization, then we will

00:05:19.383 --> 00:05:22.473
talk about it.

00:05:22.473 --> 00:05:26.343
Not before your Realization.”

00:05:26.343 --> 00:05:32.873
So then, if they are not getting any Realization,
you don’t tell them that “There is a bhoot

00:05:32.873 --> 00:05:39.413
sitting in your left Nabhi or right Nabhi.”

00:05:39.413 --> 00:05:50.983
This is our language – Sahaja Yogi’s language,
not their language.

00:05:50.983 --> 00:06:01.712
Ya, so you have to be very careful to handle
them very carefully.

00:06:01.712 --> 00:06:09.313
Now there could be a problem between, say,
a sad man’s parent’s mother and a daughter

00:06:09.313 --> 00:06:12.142
or maybe husband and wife.

00:06:12.142 --> 00:06:13.203
So …

00:06:13.203 --> 00:06:26.883
(Just a minute, this side - listen to Me,
all right?

00:06:26.883 --> 00:06:30.283
All of you should pay attention to Me.

00:06:30.283 --> 00:06:32.272
All right?

00:06:32.272 --> 00:06:37.253
No, no it’s all right.

00:06:37.253 --> 00:06:38.253
Let her be there.

00:06:38.253 --> 00:06:43.133
It’s all right, but she should pay attention
this time, all right?

00:06:43.133 --> 00:06:45.293
Sit down.)

00:06:45.293 --> 00:06:53.772
So we have to tell them that “You carry
on, don’t worry about it, because the inner

00:06:53.772 --> 00:07:08.922
joy will start giving you strength.”

00:07:08.922 --> 00:07:17.263
Then gradually the another partner will understand
you -

00:07:17.263 --> 00:07:27.033
see you’re honest, your purpose and would
try to appreciate you.

00:07:27.033 --> 00:07:30.423
Gradually it works out.

00:07:30.423 --> 00:07:45.163
But if it does not, then we’ll see about
it.

00:07:45.163 --> 00:07:58.193
Now when you handle them with love and care,
you can establish them.

00:07:58.193 --> 00:08:10.932
But if they start misbehaving you also should
not lose temper at all.

00:08:10.932 --> 00:08:15.432
You should be very forgiving.

00:08:15.432 --> 00:08:27.362
Now I must say, that in Sahaja Yoga you have
to respect your leaders.

00:08:27.362 --> 00:08:30.142
Of course, you might not find them perfect,
maybe.

00:08:30.142 --> 00:08:50.163
Or maybe
you may find them to be little bossy, possibly.

00:08:50.163 --> 00:08:54.733
But you need some bossing sometimes.

00:08:54.733 --> 00:09:07.773
And leaders must know how to also correct
people, because you need correction.

00:09:07.773 --> 00:09:18.333
I met a lady, I was telling you, we had told
them, that you need not have a guru.

00:09:18.333 --> 00:09:25.593
So, she said “No, no we must have somebody
to guide us.

00:09:25.593 --> 00:09:38.733
And that guru will guide us and also will
support us, so we would like to follow him.

00:09:38.733 --> 00:09:46.322
In spite of the fact he is a very bossy fellow
and he always gets annoyed with us and he

00:09:46.322 --> 00:09:47.843
takes money from us.

00:09:47.843 --> 00:10:12.993
And it’s not a guru, if he’s not, if he
is very soft, means he should not be kind.”

00:10:12.993 --> 00:10:23.773
So we have another kind also of people who
want somebody to dominate

00:10:23.773 --> 00:10:28.033
them for their spiritual ascent.

00:10:28.033 --> 00:10:39.213
They are better people, because they want
their ascent in any case.

00:10:39.213 --> 00:10:46.143
And they accept corrections, because they
want their ascent.

00:10:46.143 --> 00:10:48.053
That’s the first thing.

00:10:48.053 --> 00:11:01.153
So even if the leader bosses, they like it
very much.

00:11:01.153 --> 00:11:17.203
In some places people told Me, “Our guru
is very soft – we must get some strong fellow.”

00:11:17.203 --> 00:11:38.322
So I leave it to the leaders, who are called
as gurus by some people to be kind, compassionate,

00:11:38.322 --> 00:11:41.843
good.

00:11:41.843 --> 00:11:51.223
But should not compromise with nonsense and
laziness.

00:11:51.223 --> 00:11:58.963
Because the first thing, people get into is
laziness after Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:58.963 --> 00:12:06.583
We have to be committed.

00:12:06.583 --> 00:12:14.632
Now I too have a family and I have grandchildren.

00:12:14.632 --> 00:12:17.673
My daughter has come all the way to see Me
in London.

00:12:17.673 --> 00:12:28.622
She’s been there for one month and I haven’t
been there yet.

00:12:28.622 --> 00:12:36.053
She’s waiting for Me.

00:12:36.053 --> 00:12:39.833
So it’s all right, one has to do it.

00:12:39.833 --> 00:12:49.703
This is My commitment, because this is your
purpose of life.

00:12:49.703 --> 00:13:05.643
And the purpose that you have mainly is to
ascend and help others to ascend.

00:13:05.643 --> 00:13:14.563
You are special people, who have to do such
a tremendous task.

00:13:14.563 --> 00:13:23.572
Otherwise how can we have lots of people coming
to Sahaja Yoga?

00:13:23.572 --> 00:13:35.363
So the Sahaja way is to yourself improve with
meditation

00:13:35.363 --> 00:13:43.723
and introspect yourself and see yourself.

00:13:43.723 --> 00:13:55.132
You must meditate and you should not see the
defects of others.

00:13:55.132 --> 00:14:03.163
The second thing to be Sahaj is to be collective.

00:14:03.163 --> 00:14:15.533
If you do not meet collectively every day,
then there will be a problem.

00:14:15.533 --> 00:14:18.062
In the collective only the maturity starts.

00:14:18.062 --> 00:14:27.343
It is a living process as I told you.

00:14:27.343 --> 00:14:37.263
Now supposing a tree is growing and you take
out a leaf from there and the leaf will say,

00:14:37.263 --> 00:14:40.213
“I’m going to grow by myself.”

00:14:40.213 --> 00:14:46.033
It cannot grow.

00:14:46.033 --> 00:14:54.132
It will be left out.

00:14:54.132 --> 00:15:00.893
So that is what one has to remember: that
it is a collective happening.

00:15:00.893 --> 00:15:09.083
We all have to meet and grow together.

00:15:09.083 --> 00:15:24.423
Now, those who are not collective will disappear
one day into thin air, like a dead leaf.

00:15:24.423 --> 00:15:35.163
I think people don’t understand the meaning
of collective happening.

00:15:35.163 --> 00:15:46.773
It is just like a tree growing and with the
tree everything else that belongs to tree

00:15:46.773 --> 00:15:51.343
also grows.

00:15:51.343 --> 00:16:00.603
So for the growth of this tree one has to
remember that you have to stick onto the tree.

00:16:00.603 --> 00:16:13.372
But the tree is not going to run after you,
“Stick on, stick on to me, stick on to me.”

00:16:13.372 --> 00:16:23.163
For that whatever has to be done, has to be
done.

00:16:23.163 --> 00:16:32.903
You know, when the winter comes, all the leaves
fall off.

00:16:32.903 --> 00:16:40.603
What they do is to create a barrier between
themselves and the tree by some living process.

00:16:40.603 --> 00:16:52.713
They create a barrier in between, there's
a little bark that comes in between.

00:16:52.713 --> 00:17:07.503
Now when that happens the leaves fall off
and the tree becomes barren.

00:17:07.503 --> 00:17:11.743
Now same thing happens in Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:11.743 --> 00:17:23.323
When you do not accept the principle of Sahaja
Yoga you put a barrier in between the sap

00:17:23.323 --> 00:17:36.063
and
the leaf.

00:17:36.063 --> 00:17:43.273
Now when that happens, the leaf falls off.

00:17:43.273 --> 00:17:54.573
So you have to open out yourself, your heart,
everything to suck in the sap to nourish.

00:17:54.573 --> 00:18:08.013
You have to give up your Ego and Superego,
your conditionings and ideas you have had

00:18:08.013 --> 00:18:12.343
from before.

00:18:12.343 --> 00:18:24.303
This is what is the surrender, is the Islam.

00:18:24.303 --> 00:18:28.043
And that is to be achieved.

00:18:28.043 --> 00:18:36.713
But that is not going to help the tree, it
is going to help you.

00:18:36.713 --> 00:18:41.923
Now some people say, “I'm not ready.”

00:18:41.923 --> 00:18:45.543
Then how will you grow?

00:18:45.543 --> 00:18:55.183
Actually when a little child is born, immediately
it wants to suck in the mother's nourishment.

00:18:55.183 --> 00:19:13.673
It feels it has starved all this time and
it should suck mother's milk immediately.

00:19:13.673 --> 00:19:22.543
And all those are seekers, once they find
their Realization must behave in that manner.

00:19:22.543 --> 00:19:32.763
They should all give up all the conditionings
and all these nonsensical ideas and immediately

00:19:32.763 --> 00:19:53.523
push themselves and also cleanse themselves
fully to suck in more and more of this nourishment.

00:19:53.523 --> 00:19:58.133
But it does not happen that way.

00:19:58.133 --> 00:20:06.563
That's why some people do not grow that fast.

00:20:06.563 --> 00:20:16.473
It is a pure intelligence that gives you that
sense I think.

00:20:16.473 --> 00:20:26.643
Pure intelligence comes from pure heart and
if you pay more attention to your heart, your

00:20:26.643 --> 00:20:34.243
Spirit, then it will work out.

00:20:34.243 --> 00:20:48.563
In the course of your movement in Sahaja Yoga
you will see you’ll be blessed.

00:20:48.563 --> 00:20:59.623
Not only that you’ll have the blessings
but you will have jobs, you will have money

00:20:59.623 --> 00:21:08.953
or else children will pass with flying colors.

00:21:08.953 --> 00:21:13.083
They will become obedient.

00:21:13.083 --> 00:21:27.683
Your health will improve, you will get money,
you will get married, you will have nice children,

00:21:27.683 --> 00:21:40.753
wise wife, you’ll get homes and ashrams.

00:21:40.753 --> 00:21:46.573
But these are all temptations.

00:21:46.573 --> 00:21:54.033
Many people get lost in one of those.

00:21:54.033 --> 00:22:07.693
Now supposing I've to catch the plane and
on the way I see very nice gardens or things,

00:22:07.693 --> 00:22:20.723
then I get down to enjoy the gardens, how
will I reach the airport and the aeroplane?

00:22:20.723 --> 00:22:28.483
So these temptations must be seen as just
entertainments…

00:22:28.483 --> 00:22:35.373
as entertainments.

00:22:35.373 --> 00:22:45.703
Entertainment, all right?

00:22:45.703 --> 00:23:03.253
Now our understanding of Sahaj is simple if
you do not think about it.

00:23:03.253 --> 00:23:09.993
But if you start thinking you’ll go mad.

00:23:09.993 --> 00:23:23.213
How can you explain that a person just like
you can give Realization to thousands?

00:23:23.213 --> 00:23:33.933
How can you explain that you can see the sun
on My heart in a picture?

00:23:33.933 --> 00:23:38.473
All this pictures which are there, how can
you explain?

00:23:38.473 --> 00:23:47.643
For example, you get My photographs in the
sky, is a fact.

00:23:47.643 --> 00:23:54.663
How will you explain that?

00:23:54.663 --> 00:23:59.933
So it is beyond your brains.

00:23:59.933 --> 00:24:04.243
So better not think about it.

00:24:04.243 --> 00:24:06.883
Just gradually accept the joy.

00:24:06.883 --> 00:24:19.273
I always say I've done the cooking for you
and very good food.

00:24:19.273 --> 00:24:28.843
Now only thing is for you to eat it and taste
it.

00:24:28.843 --> 00:24:37.013
Why do you want to know, how it was cooked,
when it was kept and what else has been done

00:24:37.013 --> 00:24:47.543
to make it so tasty?

00:24:47.543 --> 00:24:54.523
You should just appreciate and enjoy.

00:24:54.523 --> 00:25:00.643
Like a painting you have, you don't think,
“From where did he get the paint, how did

00:25:00.643 --> 00:25:16.643
he paint and how was he sitting, what food
he must have taken, before or after?”

00:25:16.643 --> 00:25:26.613
But in Sahaja Yoga we do these ridiculous
things, you know.

00:25:26.613 --> 00:25:36.533
It's very surprising, that people do not understand
one simple thing: that Kundalini has risen

00:25:36.533 --> 00:25:46.963
without thinking and not by our effort.

00:25:46.963 --> 00:26:00.033
The Kundalini has given us this good health,
good temperament and has changed us so much.

00:26:00.033 --> 00:26:10.563
So She is going to do the job, only thing
we should try to support Her and to keep our

00:26:10.563 --> 00:26:14.993
central path clean.

00:26:14.993 --> 00:26:20.953
It's very simple.

00:26:20.953 --> 00:26:28.333
So now I feel very much encouraged to that
from Holland and from Belgium we have such

00:26:28.333 --> 00:26:34.293
nice Sahaja Yogis here, and also I would say
it is rather difficult for some people to

00:26:34.293 --> 00:26:35.813
come to India.

00:26:35.813 --> 00:26:42.563
But try to come, because those who have been
to India have settled down much better, because

00:26:42.563 --> 00:27:11.433
India has got something magical about it,
that it transforms people to a deeper level.

00:27:11.433 --> 00:27:44.623
You should not come half heartedly.

00:27:44.623 --> 00:27:49.373
I feel that those who can come on [literally??

00:27:49.373 --> 00:27:54.363
– UNCLEAR] should not find excuses, “I'm
not ready, I'm not thinking”, because such

00:27:54.363 --> 00:28:00.343
half hearted people are not going to gain
anything.

00:28:00.343 --> 00:28:11.913
You
have to come with full force, as I told you

00:28:11.913 --> 00:28:23.523
the newly born child, otherwise it is useless.

00:28:23.523 --> 00:28:31.343
Don't play into the tricks of your mind.

00:28:31.343 --> 00:28:43.883
It's like a donkey - if you take a donkey
lightly, then it will just start grazing anywhere

00:28:43.883 --> 00:28:46.163
it finds grass.

00:28:46.163 --> 00:29:02.023
And if it knows that the person sitting on
his back is a lousy fellow or a lazy person,

00:29:02.023 --> 00:29:08.013
it will drop him.

00:29:08.013 --> 00:29:21.363
And when it knows that it can go ahead of
the person then it can even kick you back.

00:29:21.363 --> 00:29:25.813
That is how your mind is.

00:29:25.813 --> 00:29:41.183
It dominates you, it sometimes starts grazing
on pastures and you think that's a very good

00:29:41.183 --> 00:29:54.253
thing, you are very peaceful or else it starts
dominating you.

00:29:54.253 --> 00:29:57.003
So how to manage this donkey?

00:29:57.003 --> 00:30:08.473
Best way is to catch hold of the ears, and
carry it with you.

00:30:08.473 --> 00:30:17.603
Donkey is for you, you are not for the donkey.

00:30:17.603 --> 00:30:28.983
So this is one of the hurdles, that we have
very much.

00:30:28.983 --> 00:30:38.963
As far as you all are concerned you have to
know that Sahaja Yoga is to be understood

00:30:38.963 --> 00:30:43.953
not by brain, but by heart.

00:30:43.953 --> 00:30:59.843
I have known people who can give big lectures
on Sahaja Yoga, can write books, but have

00:30:59.843 --> 00:31:02.373
no vibrations.

00:31:02.373 --> 00:31:05.053
So this is not the way Sahaja Yoga is.

00:31:05.053 --> 00:31:12.163
You have to be a Yogi.

00:31:12.163 --> 00:31:15.333
That's a religion in a way in our being.

00:31:15.333 --> 00:31:24.493
That's the religion of a Yogi.

00:31:24.493 --> 00:31:35.962
Like human beings have ten valencies, a Yogi
must have at least eleven valencies.

00:31:35.962 --> 00:31:46.563
And the eleventh valency integrates you with
the religion.

00:31:46.563 --> 00:32:07.793
You get identified with righteousness, with
compassion, with love, with assiduity - perseverance

00:32:07.793 --> 00:32:21.553
- or also detachment.

00:32:21.553 --> 00:32:26.643
That means you do not expect anything.

00:32:26.643 --> 00:32:31.363
You do it for doing’s sake.

00:32:31.363 --> 00:32:35.713
You love for loving’s sake.

00:32:35.713 --> 00:32:39.063
That's the best way to enjoy.

00:32:39.063 --> 00:32:42.013
You enjoy your loving capacity.

00:32:42.013 --> 00:32:49.933
You enjoy your generosity.

00:32:49.933 --> 00:32:56.083
You enjoy your forgiveness.

00:32:56.083 --> 00:33:03.353
Enjoy all these great qualities of righteousness.

00:33:03.353 --> 00:33:13.203
You’ll never feel hurt.

00:33:13.203 --> 00:33:18.913
I do that all the time.

00:33:18.913 --> 00:33:24.543
That's how I'm always happy and full of joy.

00:33:24.543 --> 00:33:28.603
May God bless you!
