WEBVTT

00:02.700 --> 00:15.753
It was so very nice to come to Belgium and
have so many people for our program and I

00:15.753 --> 00:28.253
must say, now we are getting to people who
are very sensitive.

00:28.253 --> 00:50.313
[translation follows - yes] It is a .. it
is a new dimension I think, I feel, we are

00:50.313 --> 00:53.393
entering into.

00:53.393 --> 01:04.363
Because now we are really getting people who
are seriously interested in their realization

01:04.363 --> 01:10.732
and are very respectful.

01:10.732 --> 01:13.293
And that aggressiveness is much less.

01:13.293 --> 01:21.743
You don’t find anybody being aggressive.

01:21.743 --> 01:36.932
So we can say, that now the road is paved
for all of you to work it out in a Sahaj manner

01:36.932 --> 01:49.972
to bring them properly to Sahaja Yoga and
settle them nicely.

01:49.972 --> 01:57.743
Now this Sahaj manner should be understood.

01:57.743 --> 02:05.753
In a Sahaj manner, when they come to you,
you must know they are absolutely new to Sahaja

02:05.753 --> 02:09.403
Yoga.

02:09.403 --> 02:17.952
So first and foremost thing, you should not
talk about Me.

02:17.952 --> 02:34.713
You should not tell them anything about Me;
but you have to tell them about Sahaja Yoga

02:34.713 --> 02:38.743
and about yourself.

02:38.743 --> 02:44.672
Like you can say, “I had the same problem
as you have.”

02:44.672 --> 02:58.062
Or you can say that “See, it took me more
time then it

02:58.062 --> 02:59.103
took you.”

02:59.103 --> 03:04.443
It’s a little lie, but doesn’t matter.

03:04.443 --> 03:09.372
[Shri Mataji laughs.]

03:09.372 --> 03:19.862
You see, because first of all, you must understand
human beings.

03:19.862 --> 03:28.434
If you tell them directly “You are bad”
or “You are evil; you are bootish” then

03:28.434 --> 03:34.892
they will run away, though it is true.

03:34.892 --> 03:40.713
A lady from France came to see Me.

03:40.713 --> 03:50.613
She said that “They told me I’m evil.”

03:50.613 --> 03:52.473
So I said, “No, no you are not.

03:52.473 --> 03:54.803
Who told you that?”

03:54.803 --> 04:03.553
And gradually she improved.

04:03.553 --> 04:13.743
So you have to tell them that “You are the
Spirit” and whatever is hanging on to them

04:13.743 --> 04:30.003
will be dropped out
and will be cleared out by their Kundalini.

04:30.003 --> 04:42.043
So if that happens they feel happy and they
get their benevolence.

04:42.043 --> 04:49.992
It is how beautifully you handle another person.

04:49.992 --> 04:55.933
Now there maybe people who want to argue.

04:55.933 --> 05:03.203
With them you should say, “You know, you
cannot argue it out, because it is beyond

05:03.203 --> 05:11.453
human awareness.”

05:11.453 --> 05:19.383
And you better tell them that it is … “You
better take your Realization, then we will

05:19.383 --> 05:22.473
talk about it.

05:22.473 --> 05:26.343
Not before your Realization.”

05:26.343 --> 05:32.873
So then, if they are not getting any Realization,
you don’t tell them that “There is a bhoot

05:32.873 --> 05:39.413
sitting in your left Nabhi or right Nabhi.”

05:39.413 --> 05:50.983
This is our language – Sahaja Yogi’s language,
not their language.

05:50.983 --> 06:01.712
Ya, so you have to be very careful to handle
them very carefully.

06:01.712 --> 06:09.313
Now there could be a problem between, say,
a sad man’s parent’s mother and a daughter

06:09.313 --> 06:12.142
or maybe husband and wife.

06:12.142 --> 06:13.203
So …

06:13.203 --> 06:26.883
(Just a minute, this side - listen to Me,
all right?

06:26.883 --> 06:30.283
All of you should pay attention to Me.

06:30.283 --> 06:32.272
All right?

06:32.272 --> 06:37.253
No, no it’s all right.

06:37.253 --> 06:38.253
Let her be there.

06:38.253 --> 06:43.133
It’s all right, but she should pay attention
this time, all right?

06:43.133 --> 06:45.293
Sit down.)

06:45.293 --> 06:53.772
So we have to tell them that “You carry
on, don’t worry about it, because the inner

06:53.772 --> 07:08.922
joy will start giving you strength.”

07:08.922 --> 07:17.263
Then gradually the another partner will understand
you -

07:17.263 --> 07:27.033
see you’re honest, your purpose and would
try to appreciate you.

07:27.033 --> 07:30.423
Gradually it works out.

07:30.423 --> 07:45.163
But if it does not, then we’ll see about
it.

07:45.163 --> 07:58.193
Now when you handle them with love and care,
you can establish them.

07:58.193 --> 08:10.932
But if they start misbehaving you also should
not lose temper at all.

08:10.932 --> 08:15.432
You should be very forgiving.

08:15.432 --> 08:27.362
Now I must say, that in Sahaja Yoga you have
to respect your leaders.

08:27.362 --> 08:30.142
Of course, you might not find them perfect,
maybe.

08:30.142 --> 08:50.163
Or maybe
you may find them to be little bossy, possibly.

08:50.163 --> 08:54.733
But you need some bossing sometimes.

08:54.733 --> 09:07.773
And leaders must know how to also correct
people, because you need correction.

09:07.773 --> 09:18.333
I met a lady, I was telling you, we had told
them, that you need not have a guru.

09:18.333 --> 09:25.593
So, she said “No, no we must have somebody
to guide us.

09:25.593 --> 09:38.733
And that guru will guide us and also will
support us, so we would like to follow him.

09:38.733 --> 09:46.322
In spite of the fact he is a very bossy fellow
and he always gets annoyed with us and he

09:46.322 --> 09:47.843
takes money from us.

09:47.843 --> 10:12.993
And it’s not a guru, if he’s not, if he
is very soft, means he should not be kind.”

10:12.993 --> 10:23.773
So we have another kind also of people who
want somebody to dominate

10:23.773 --> 10:28.033
them for their spiritual ascent.

10:28.033 --> 10:39.213
They are better people, because they want
their ascent in any case.

10:39.213 --> 10:46.143
And they accept corrections, because they
want their ascent.

10:46.143 --> 10:48.053
That’s the first thing.

10:48.053 --> 11:01.153
So even if the leader bosses, they like it
very much.

11:01.153 --> 11:17.203
In some places people told Me, “Our guru
is very soft – we must get some strong fellow.”

11:17.203 --> 11:38.322
So I leave it to the leaders, who are called
as gurus by some people to be kind, compassionate,

11:38.322 --> 11:41.843
good.

11:41.843 --> 11:51.223
But should not compromise with nonsense and
laziness.

11:51.223 --> 11:58.963
Because the first thing, people get into is
laziness after Sahaja Yoga.

11:58.963 --> 12:06.583
We have to be committed.

12:06.583 --> 12:14.632
Now I too have a family and I have grandchildren.

12:14.632 --> 12:17.673
My daughter has come all the way to see Me
in London.

12:17.673 --> 12:28.622
She’s been there for one month and I haven’t
been there yet.

12:28.622 --> 12:36.053
She’s waiting for Me.

12:36.053 --> 12:39.833
So it’s all right, one has to do it.

12:39.833 --> 12:49.703
This is My commitment, because this is your
purpose of life.

12:49.703 --> 13:05.643
And the purpose that you have mainly is to
ascend and help others to ascend.

13:05.643 --> 13:14.563
You are special people, who have to do such
a tremendous task.

13:14.563 --> 13:23.572
Otherwise how can we have lots of people coming
to Sahaja Yoga?

13:23.572 --> 13:35.363
So the Sahaja way is to yourself improve with
meditation

13:35.363 --> 13:43.723
and introspect yourself and see yourself.

13:43.723 --> 13:55.132
You must meditate and you should not see the
defects of others.

13:55.132 --> 14:03.163
The second thing to be Sahaj is to be collective.

14:03.163 --> 14:15.533
If you do not meet collectively every day,
then there will be a problem.

14:15.533 --> 14:18.062
In the collective only the maturity starts.

14:18.062 --> 14:27.343
It is a living process as I told you.

14:27.343 --> 14:37.263
Now supposing a tree is growing and you take
out a leaf from there and the leaf will say,

14:37.263 --> 14:40.213
“I’m going to grow by myself.”

14:40.213 --> 14:46.033
It cannot grow.

14:46.033 --> 14:54.132
It will be left out.

14:54.132 --> 15:00.893
So that is what one has to remember: that
it is a collective happening.

15:00.893 --> 15:09.083
We all have to meet and grow together.

15:09.083 --> 15:24.423
Now, those who are not collective will disappear
one day into thin air, like a dead leaf.

15:24.423 --> 15:35.163
I think people don’t understand the meaning
of collective happening.

15:35.163 --> 15:46.773
It is just like a tree growing and with the
tree everything else that belongs to tree

15:46.773 --> 15:51.343
also grows.

15:51.343 --> 16:00.603
So for the growth of this tree one has to
remember that you have to stick onto the tree.

16:00.603 --> 16:13.372
But the tree is not going to run after you,
“Stick on, stick on to me, stick on to me.”

16:13.372 --> 16:23.163
For that whatever has to be done, has to be
done.

16:23.163 --> 16:32.903
You know, when the winter comes, all the leaves
fall off.

16:32.903 --> 16:40.603
What they do is to create a barrier between
themselves and the tree by some living process.

16:40.603 --> 16:52.713
They create a barrier in between, there's
a little bark that comes in between.

16:52.713 --> 17:07.503
Now when that happens the leaves fall off
and the tree becomes barren.

17:07.503 --> 17:11.743
Now same thing happens in Sahaja Yoga.

17:11.743 --> 17:23.323
When you do not accept the principle of Sahaja
Yoga you put a barrier in between the sap

17:23.323 --> 17:36.063
and
the leaf.

17:36.063 --> 17:43.273
Now when that happens, the leaf falls off.

17:43.273 --> 17:54.573
So you have to open out yourself, your heart,
everything to suck in the sap to nourish.

17:54.573 --> 18:08.013
You have to give up your Ego and Superego,
your conditionings and ideas you have had

18:08.013 --> 18:12.343
from before.

18:12.343 --> 18:24.303
This is what is the surrender, is the Islam.

18:24.303 --> 18:28.043
And that is to be achieved.

18:28.043 --> 18:36.713
But that is not going to help the tree, it
is going to help you.

18:36.713 --> 18:41.923
Now some people say, “I'm not ready.”

18:41.923 --> 18:45.543
Then how will you grow?

18:45.543 --> 18:55.183
Actually when a little child is born, immediately
it wants to suck in the mother's nourishment.

18:55.183 --> 19:13.673
It feels it has starved all this time and
it should suck mother's milk immediately.

19:13.673 --> 19:22.543
And all those are seekers, once they find
their Realization must behave in that manner.

19:22.543 --> 19:32.763
They should all give up all the conditionings
and all these nonsensical ideas and immediately

19:32.763 --> 19:53.523
push themselves and also cleanse themselves
fully to suck in more and more of this nourishment.

19:53.523 --> 19:58.133
But it does not happen that way.

19:58.133 --> 20:06.563
That's why some people do not grow that fast.

20:06.563 --> 20:16.473
It is a pure intelligence that gives you that
sense I think.

20:16.473 --> 20:26.643
Pure intelligence comes from pure heart and
if you pay more attention to your heart, your

20:26.643 --> 20:34.243
Spirit, then it will work out.

20:34.243 --> 20:48.563
In the course of your movement in Sahaja Yoga
you will see you’ll be blessed.

20:48.563 --> 20:59.623
Not only that you’ll have the blessings
but you will have jobs, you will have money

20:59.623 --> 21:08.953
or else children will pass with flying colors.

21:08.953 --> 21:13.083
They will become obedient.

21:13.083 --> 21:27.683
Your health will improve, you will get money,
you will get married, you will have nice children,

21:27.683 --> 21:40.753
wise wife, you’ll get homes and ashrams.

21:40.753 --> 21:46.573
But these are all temptations.

21:46.573 --> 21:54.033
Many people get lost in one of those.

21:54.033 --> 22:07.693
Now supposing I've to catch the plane and
on the way I see very nice gardens or things,

22:07.693 --> 22:20.723
then I get down to enjoy the gardens, how
will I reach the airport and the aeroplane?

22:20.723 --> 22:28.483
So these temptations must be seen as just
entertainments…

22:28.483 --> 22:35.373
as entertainments.

22:35.373 --> 22:45.703
Entertainment, all right?

22:45.703 --> 23:03.253
Now our understanding of Sahaj is simple if
you do not think about it.

23:03.253 --> 23:09.993
But if you start thinking you’ll go mad.

23:09.993 --> 23:23.213
How can you explain that a person just like
you can give Realization to thousands?

23:23.213 --> 23:33.933
How can you explain that you can see the sun
on My heart in a picture?

23:33.933 --> 23:38.473
All this pictures which are there, how can
you explain?

23:38.473 --> 23:47.643
For example, you get My photographs in the
sky, is a fact.

23:47.643 --> 23:54.663
How will you explain that?

23:54.663 --> 23:59.933
So it is beyond your brains.

23:59.933 --> 24:04.243
So better not think about it.

24:04.243 --> 24:06.883
Just gradually accept the joy.

24:06.883 --> 24:19.273
I always say I've done the cooking for you
and very good food.

24:19.273 --> 24:28.843
Now only thing is for you to eat it and taste
it.

24:28.843 --> 24:37.013
Why do you want to know, how it was cooked,
when it was kept and what else has been done

24:37.013 --> 24:47.543
to make it so tasty?

24:47.543 --> 24:54.523
You should just appreciate and enjoy.

24:54.523 --> 25:00.643
Like a painting you have, you don't think,
“From where did he get the paint, how did

25:00.643 --> 25:16.643
he paint and how was he sitting, what food
he must have taken, before or after?”

25:16.643 --> 25:26.613
But in Sahaja Yoga we do these ridiculous
things, you know.

25:26.613 --> 25:36.533
It's very surprising, that people do not understand
one simple thing: that Kundalini has risen

25:36.533 --> 25:46.963
without thinking and not by our effort.

25:46.963 --> 26:00.033
The Kundalini has given us this good health,
good temperament and has changed us so much.

26:00.033 --> 26:10.563
So She is going to do the job, only thing
we should try to support Her and to keep our

26:10.563 --> 26:14.993
central path clean.

26:14.993 --> 26:20.953
It's very simple.

26:20.953 --> 26:28.333
So now I feel very much encouraged to that
from Holland and from Belgium we have such

26:28.333 --> 26:34.293
nice Sahaja Yogis here, and also I would say
it is rather difficult for some people to

26:34.293 --> 26:35.813
come to India.

26:35.813 --> 26:42.563
But try to come, because those who have been
to India have settled down much better, because

26:42.563 --> 27:11.433
India has got something magical about it,
that it transforms people to a deeper level.

27:11.433 --> 27:44.623
You should not come half heartedly.

27:44.623 --> 27:49.373
I feel that those who can come on [literally??

27:49.373 --> 27:54.363
– UNCLEAR] should not find excuses, “I'm
not ready, I'm not thinking”, because such

27:54.363 --> 28:00.343
half hearted people are not going to gain
anything.

28:00.343 --> 28:11.913
You
have to come with full force, as I told you

28:11.913 --> 28:23.523
the newly born child, otherwise it is useless.

28:23.523 --> 28:31.343
Don't play into the tricks of your mind.

28:31.343 --> 28:43.883
It's like a donkey - if you take a donkey
lightly, then it will just start grazing anywhere

28:43.883 --> 28:46.163
it finds grass.

28:46.163 --> 29:02.023
And if it knows that the person sitting on
his back is a lousy fellow or a lazy person,

29:02.023 --> 29:08.013
it will drop him.

29:08.013 --> 29:21.363
And when it knows that it can go ahead of
the person then it can even kick you back.

29:21.363 --> 29:25.813
That is how your mind is.

29:25.813 --> 29:41.183
It dominates you, it sometimes starts grazing
on pastures and you think that's a very good

29:41.183 --> 29:54.253
thing, you are very peaceful or else it starts
dominating you.

29:54.253 --> 29:57.003
So how to manage this donkey?

29:57.003 --> 30:08.473
Best way is to catch hold of the ears, and
carry it with you.

30:08.473 --> 30:17.603
Donkey is for you, you are not for the donkey.

30:17.603 --> 30:28.983
So this is one of the hurdles, that we have
very much.

30:28.983 --> 30:38.963
As far as you all are concerned you have to
know that Sahaja Yoga is to be understood

30:38.963 --> 30:43.953
not by brain, but by heart.

30:43.953 --> 30:59.843
I have known people who can give big lectures
on Sahaja Yoga, can write books, but have

30:59.843 --> 31:02.373
no vibrations.

31:02.373 --> 31:05.053
So this is not the way Sahaja Yoga is.

31:05.053 --> 31:12.163
You have to be a Yogi.

31:12.163 --> 31:15.333
That's a religion in a way in our being.

31:15.333 --> 31:24.493
That's the religion of a Yogi.

31:24.493 --> 31:35.962
Like human beings have ten valencies, a Yogi
must have at least eleven valencies.

31:35.962 --> 31:46.563
And the eleventh valency integrates you with
the religion.

31:46.563 --> 32:07.793
You get identified with righteousness, with
compassion, with love, with assiduity - perseverance

32:07.793 --> 32:21.553
- or also detachment.

32:21.553 --> 32:26.643
That means you do not expect anything.

32:26.643 --> 32:31.363
You do it for doing’s sake.

32:31.363 --> 32:35.713
You love for loving’s sake.

32:35.713 --> 32:39.063
That's the best way to enjoy.

32:39.063 --> 32:42.013
You enjoy your loving capacity.

32:42.013 --> 32:49.933
You enjoy your generosity.

32:49.933 --> 32:56.083
You enjoy your forgiveness.

32:56.083 --> 33:03.353
Enjoy all these great qualities of righteousness.

33:03.353 --> 33:13.203
You’ll never feel hurt.

33:13.203 --> 33:18.913
I do that all the time.

33:18.913 --> 33:24.543
That's how I'm always happy and full of joy.

33:24.543 --> 33:28.603
May God bless you!
