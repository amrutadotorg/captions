WEBVTT

00:00.320 --> 00:14.160
Now if you have left Agnya, that means there’s
possession on it.

00:14.160 --> 00:15.249
That means all of you have got something of
that kind, already you’re caught up, you’re

00:15.249 --> 00:16.249
not clean.

00:16.249 --> 00:17.249
What is the mantra for this, Gavin?

00:17.249 --> 00:18.249
For the back Agnya, Mahaganesh.

00:18.249 --> 00:19.249
Mahaganesh, Mahabhairava, correct.

00:19.249 --> 00:20.849
Now see, in the brain you’ve got all these
seeds of the gods and they are the seeds because

00:20.849 --> 00:22.070
they’re the causal of these.

00:22.070 --> 00:37.830
So the first, the causal is created and then
the deities are created.

00:37.830 --> 00:41.750
So, for example, causal of the Mother Earth
is fragrance, all right.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.040
So from fragrance comes the Mother Earth.

00:44.040 --> 00:50.450
In the same way the causal of Brahmadeva is
Hiranyagarbha, all right?

00:50.450 --> 00:54.000
He’s called as Hiranyagarbha.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.430
He’s the causal of Brahmadeva.

00:58.430 --> 01:04.640
Where does he stay in the brain?

01:04.640 --> 01:18.829
In the brain of the Virata whatever deities
leave are the causal and manas also, because

01:18.829 --> 01:20.600
they’re reflected.

01:20.600 --> 01:33.909
So the causal ones are here in our brain,
in our brain, in our brain.

01:33.909 --> 01:48.979
At the back here, around the Agnya, now I
give you the name, no, around the Agnya.

01:48.979 --> 02:03.520
Agnya is Mahaganesha and Mahabhairava, Agnya,
at the back.

02:03.520 --> 02:09.220
And in front…

02:09.220 --> 02:24.450
At the back is actually Mahaganesha, just
in the center.

02:24.450 --> 02:25.450
Just in the central point is Mahaganesha.

02:25.450 --> 02:26.450
This is the minutest point.

02:26.450 --> 02:27.450
Around him moves Mahabhairava, all right?

02:27.450 --> 02:32.620
And around this, the rest of it that moves
is Hiranyagarbha, all right?

02:32.620 --> 02:34.450
Now did you follow that?

02:34.450 --> 02:51.520
So when you think, or whatever thinking you
do, through this superego, through this superego,

02:51.520 --> 03:08.380
you get the development of this Hiranyagarbha.

03:08.380 --> 03:12.090
Did you follow that?

03:12.090 --> 03:16.710
And also otherwise, is also, who acts when
you think?

03:16.710 --> 03:19.350
Is Hiranyagarbha.

03:19.350 --> 03:37.830
This is Swadisthana, we call it, this is Swadisthana
chakra around it, all right?

03:37.830 --> 03:49.710
Now, so Swadisthana is divided into left and
right.

03:49.710 --> 04:10.820
Left Swadisthana is Hiranyagarbha and right
Swadisthana is also Hiranyagarbha, at the

04:10.820 --> 04:11.820
back here.

04:11.820 --> 04:15.180
So now to point out first of all, at the back,
if you move, is Mahaganesha.

04:15.180 --> 04:18.540
Around him moves Bhairava, who protects Mahaganesha.

04:18.540 --> 04:21.800
Around it moves, now moves Hiranyagarbha,
at the back.

04:21.800 --> 04:41.560
But Hiranyagarbha has left and right side
while Bhairava and Ganesha, they move on each

04:41.560 --> 04:43.120
other.

04:43.120 --> 04:46.770
Did you follow that point?

04:46.770 --> 05:07.400
Now in front, in the center here, is who?

05:07.400 --> 05:27.420
Kartikeya, in the center; Christ is in the
center, in the center itself where the optic

05:27.420 --> 05:30.070
chiasma is.

05:30.070 --> 05:35.370
Here outside is Kartikeya.

05:35.370 --> 05:39.350
What is Kartikeya?

05:39.350 --> 05:49.740
Kartikeya is the protector of Christ.

05:49.740 --> 06:12.260
Around Kartikeya, they’re all protectors
of Christ, moves who?

06:12.260 --> 06:13.770
Now who is Mahabhairava’s counterpart?

06:13.770 --> 06:15.460
Mahahanumana, Mahahanumana, all right?

06:15.460 --> 06:17.990
And around that, what does move?

06:17.990 --> 06:18.990
Ekadasha Rudra.

06:18.990 --> 06:40.210
The movement of Ekadasha Rudra is not circular,
doesn’t move like that.

06:40.210 --> 06:47.990
It moves like that.

06:47.990 --> 07:01.590
Or you can say, move like that.

07:01.590 --> 07:04.110
Now what is Ekadasha Rudra?

07:04.110 --> 07:07.350
Let us see.

07:07.350 --> 07:13.670
Can you give the names?

07:13.670 --> 07:16.030
Of Ekadasha.

07:16.030 --> 07:20.750
Take one by one.

07:20.750 --> 07:23.100
Buddha, right?

07:23.100 --> 07:24.280
Mahavira.

07:24.280 --> 07:29.000
Then Christ, then Mahabhairava.

07:29.000 --> 07:34.889
How many of them, four.

07:34.889 --> 07:38.430
Then Mahaganesha, five.

07:38.430 --> 07:43.139
Did I say Bhairava?

07:43.139 --> 07:57.290
Again, again say it one by one, Buddha, Mahavira,
Christ, Mahaganesha, Mahabhairava.

07:57.290 --> 08:20.240
All right, this is very clear cut for you
because just now I’ve told all of them.

08:20.240 --> 08:25.050
Buddha, Mahavira, Christ.

08:25.050 --> 08:33.950
Then, what else, four are left, four are still
left.

08:33.950 --> 08:36.560
Mahahanumana, you didn’t tell?

08:36.560 --> 08:40.479
Mahahanumana, how much it is now?

08:40.479 --> 08:46.010
Three left, no four are left, four, now what
are these four?

08:46.010 --> 08:47.310
Say, it’s very simple.

08:47.310 --> 09:00.589
Just now

09:00.589 --> 09:05.650
I discussed with you Mahahanumana, Mahabhairava,
two, Buddha, Mahavira.

09:05.650 --> 09:07.860
Four, now, Kartikeya.

09:07.860 --> 09:10.080
Kartikeya, Ganesha, sixth.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.560
Christ, seventh.

09:11.560 --> 09:31.670
Now four more are left, now who are the four
more, let’s see, can I have it?

09:31.670 --> 09:37.270
Pat, come along.

09:37.270 --> 09:44.180
You’ve done lot of reading.

09:44.180 --> 09:57.210
They have written it down into something,
eleven of these.

09:57.210 --> 10:01.120
Brahmadeva, Hiranyagarbha, correct.

10:01.120 --> 10:11.540
Vishnu, Narayana, Lakshmi Narayana, how much
it is.

10:11.540 --> 10:15.450
Shiva, Parvati, everyone.

10:15.450 --> 10:21.960
Shiva and Shakti, all right?

10:21.960 --> 10:25.870
Eleven of them.

10:25.870 --> 10:34.000
Lakshmi Narayana is one, Brahmadeva Saraswati
is back, Shiva Parvati has…

10:34.000 --> 10:36.760
All eleven are there.

10:36.760 --> 10:39.520
Why Shiva and Parvati?

10:39.520 --> 10:55.370
Two have to be taken because Shiva is the
Guru, Parvati is the Shakti.

10:55.370 --> 10:58.000
So if you catch on void, the beginning of
the trouble starts because Shiva is the central

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
path.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.110
There Shiva is to be taken as Guru, Shiva
is Guru, Shiva is the one who is our Guru.

11:01.110 --> 11:02.110
He is our spirit.

11:02.110 --> 11:03.590
But he’s not the spirit that protects because
spirit needs no protection.

11:03.590 --> 11:05.510
Whom do you protect then, also.

11:05.510 --> 11:12.070
So when you protect, you protect the spirit
but what protects it is the Guru personality

11:12.070 --> 11:14.940
which is Shiva, which is Shiva actually.

11:14.940 --> 11:16.580
Did you get that?

11:16.580 --> 11:17.580
Now you might say how is Shiva is “Guru
Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devom, Maheshwara,

11:17.580 --> 11:18.580
Guru Sakshat, Parabrahma, Tasmai Shri Guruveh
Namah.”

11:18.580 --> 11:19.580
Because Guru means a person who is full of
Gurutwakashan, is weight, is the gravity.

11:19.580 --> 11:21.530
Person who is with gravity, which has some
sense, which is density, which is our spirit.

11:21.530 --> 11:22.530
Otherwise we have no density, we’re useless.

11:22.530 --> 11:23.950
Our spirit goes away, we float in the air.

11:23.950 --> 11:34.050
So the Guru is everything.

11:34.050 --> 11:51.010
Today I’ve called you here to tell you how
to become a Guru.

11:51.010 --> 11:58.770
So that’s why I’ve given you this introduction.

11:58.770 --> 11:59.770
Is it clear to you?

11:59.770 --> 12:00.770
All right let Me know now…

12:00.770 --> 12:01.770
(Apparent break in recording here)

12:01.770 --> 12:02.770
See that? , just laugh at yourself; see that?
, just laugh at yourself.

12:02.770 --> 12:03.770
With all your knowledge of how many years
I’ve been talking to you, look at this,

12:03.770 --> 12:04.770
this is the point.

12:04.770 --> 12:05.770
How Mother raising… just given just like
that, do I tell you something.

12:05.770 --> 12:08.620
You all have gone to the wrong gurus, you
have done, because… , nothing of the kind.

12:08.620 --> 12:09.620
Just because you’re all kept here, it’s
the Ekadasha Rudra on your forehead, it’s

12:09.620 --> 12:10.620
to bow before any wrong guru.

12:10.620 --> 12:11.620
With that your Ekadasha Rudra…

12:11.620 --> 12:12.620
Sahaja Yoga is very simple you know.

12:12.620 --> 12:13.620
If you put your glass upside down , if you
put it like this . Sahaja Yoga is so simple,

12:13.620 --> 12:14.620
do you follow that point?

12:14.620 --> 12:16.070
So we reach one conclusion, by mental understanding
you cannot understand Sahaja Yoga.

12:16.070 --> 12:32.750
So as a guru what could you have?

12:32.750 --> 12:40.020
I’ve made a promise.

12:40.020 --> 12:44.420
That’s different.

12:44.420 --> 12:57.640
You are telling like this, if I say that,
“What is the sense of, say, guru?”

12:57.640 --> 13:02.490
Do you say that it should not become artificial?

13:02.490 --> 13:09.250
Now let’s see again quite straight forward,
what is the question?

13:09.250 --> 13:13.140
No, no, what is the question?

13:13.140 --> 13:29.020
Now try to remember.

13:29.020 --> 13:50.120
What should we have?

13:50.120 --> 14:27.060
What is the question, let’s see exactly.

14:27.060 --> 14:32.340
Exactly.

14:32.340 --> 14:48.170
How do you…

14:48.170 --> 16:06.709
This is another question but the question
I asked is: then what must a guru do?

16:06.709 --> 16:15.583
The thing I said, by discussion Sahaja Yoga
doesn’t work out then what should we do?

16:15.583 --> 16:16.583
I asked the question what should we do?

16:16.583 --> 16:17.583
Make it simple always related to your Mother,
you’ll get the answer.

16:17.583 --> 16:18.583
Hah!

16:18.583 --> 16:19.583
All right?

16:19.583 --> 16:51.020
To neutralize the old guru who has been a
bad guru you have to surrender to the real

16:51.020 --> 16:54.230
guru.

16:54.230 --> 17:36.620
If your guru is the real guru then you surrender
to the Mother of your real guru.

17:36.620 --> 17:45.010
Because your real guru is also surrendered
to Me.

17:45.010 --> 17:58.059
So all gurus are to be surrendered at the
lotus feet of your Mother.

17:58.059 --> 17:59.331
Then if it is Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, Shiva,
Krishna, Christ, anyone of them also, Ekadasha

17:59.331 --> 18:00.331
still is more than your Mother’s.

18:00.331 --> 18:01.331
It is very difficult because we want to stick
on to something, even the real guru.

18:01.331 --> 18:09.169
Christ is a real guru but the Christ you know
of is to be also surrendered at the lotus

18:09.169 --> 18:17.520
feet of your Mother because we also know that.

18:17.520 --> 18:20.429
Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, all of them are My
servants.

18:20.429 --> 18:22.799
Adi Shakti is the Mother.

18:22.799 --> 18:59.480
She’s the Mother of all the gurus, of all
the prophets, of all the incarnations, of

18:59.480 --> 19:26.989
all the . After Her, only Parabrahma is created,
after that only Parabrahma.

19:26.989 --> 20:09.610
So when you have got someone like that to
surrender, is a maya.

20:09.610 --> 20:10.610
That is the biggest problem because you’ve
got somebody so easily.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.610
Arjuna was a great warrior till the war started,
and somebody was a great swimmer when he came

20:12.610 --> 20:13.610
to the ocean.

20:13.610 --> 20:14.610
Allow your mind to do the work, allow your
mind.

20:14.610 --> 20:15.610
So to be the highest guru we’ve to be completely
surrendered.

20:15.610 --> 20:16.610
Now when you’re surrendered, you don’t
doubt.

20:16.610 --> 20:17.610
For Me this finger is completely surrendered,
say, to My body, it doesn’t doubt My body.

20:17.610 --> 20:18.610
Supposing I’m pressing and it receives the
information that you’re doing that he informs

20:18.610 --> 20:19.610
the brain and informs the body that I’m
doing that.

20:19.610 --> 20:57.289
It says some thing must be done to remove
it, the whole body acts, all the fingers act

20:57.289 --> 21:05.520
and all the power flows there, the energy
flows there where the finger is hurt.

21:05.520 --> 21:15.320
So when you are surrendered there is no question
of individualism.

21:15.320 --> 21:49.460
Those people who think of any kind of individualism
are going to go out of the circulation of.

21:49.460 --> 22:00.129
From the beginning, I’ve told you many a
time if we take out all those people who want

22:00.129 --> 22:01.700
to assert their individualism of any kind.

22:01.700 --> 22:18.220
You see, this is a branch, all right, you
can see here.

22:18.220 --> 22:26.919
In the last stage, I use the same analogy
better and better.

22:26.919 --> 22:35.100
Outside is the same, all right?

22:35.100 --> 23:08.480
If inside and outside is the same and the
rest is . If this has to become this, what

23:08.480 --> 23:17.860
has to . This myth has to go, all right?

23:17.860 --> 23:23.080
This myth has to vanish.

23:23.080 --> 23:35.580
So this myth is made from what, our ego and
superego only.

23:35.580 --> 23:54.279
These are actually the end result of all the
nonsense we have been.

23:54.279 --> 24:12.769
In a sense, all this has to go, vanish, it
doesn’t exist at all, that is .

24:12.769 --> 24:22.349
In a way you cannot be a guru unless and until
, you are open to it, that’s coming and

24:22.349 --> 24:23.690
going, but supposing you’re like this.

24:23.690 --> 24:27.259
To be like the story I heard in India that
there was a , three of them.

24:27.259 --> 24:29.470
They went inside the to have something.

24:29.470 --> 24:38.179
They sat down on a table and they saw a flask
put like this.

24:38.179 --> 24:50.679
They said, “What sort of a flask is this,
it has no mouth.”

24:50.679 --> 24:56.529
So they called the bearer and said, “See
we can’t have food unless and until it has

24:56.529 --> 24:57.529
a mouth, take it back.”

24:57.529 --> 24:58.529
They said, “What sort of a glass is this,
it has no water?”

24:58.529 --> 24:59.529
Because . But when you’re surrendered the
mouth and bottom is , luckily its…

24:59.529 --> 25:00.529
That surrendering is to be achieved if you’re
going to be .

25:00.529 --> 25:01.529
This is all mental, how do you . Have a bandhan.

25:01.529 --> 25:02.529
How many times you give yourself bandhan?

25:02.529 --> 25:03.529
Before sleeping, after getting up, then namaskar
to your Mother, , touching My feet, very important,

25:03.529 --> 25:04.529
not to come on to the Agnya, supposed to correct.

25:04.529 --> 25:05.529
Even sitting down there I’m catching, . Then
again put on both the feet, again you try.

25:05.529 --> 25:06.529
First right and then left.

25:06.529 --> 25:07.529
Ah!

25:07.529 --> 25:08.529
See now.

25:08.529 --> 25:09.529
It’s not mental, this is the point I’m
bringing you.

25:09.529 --> 25:09.536
It is not mental, now this is.
