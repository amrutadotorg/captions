00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Interviewer: To be born a realized soul is a gift from God.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Shri Mataji: Of course. Of course. Apart from that these days are many children who are children of the Sahaja Yogis are born realized.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Shri Mataji: Yes, it's very surprising that I think all the great souls want to take birth with the Sahaja Yogis.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Interviewer: What is your opinion about hatha yoga?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Shri Mataji:  hatha yoga is a thing which was preached by or written by Patanjali thousands of years back.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Shri Mataji:  And in those days, first they used to cleanse the person. It is Ashtanga, eight. There are eight Anga, means parts.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Shri Mataji:  And one of the parts is the wee bit of that is this exercise, the physical exercise.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Shri Mataji:  So his style was to cleanse a person first physically, then mentally, then emotionally, go on and on and on. And then he would get realization.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Shri Mataji: One in a million would get realization. That was the tradition.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Shri Mataji: So I have thought of the modern times. People have no time for anything.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Shri Mataji: So Sahaja Yoga is a very quick method.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Shri Mataji: First get your realization and then you correct yourself.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Shri Mataji:  And no obligation. You yourself know about yourself.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Shri Mataji:  For example, some Sahaja Yogi might come and say, Mother, I have a very bad Agnya. It means I have a very bad ego. But normally nobody says like that.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Shri Mataji:  That I am full of ego. But nobody says because suddenly introspection starts.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Shri Mataji: And you want to correct yourself. And you know how to correct.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Interviewer: So how do we come to the balance between the love for ourselves and love for others?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Shri Mataji:  You become love, that's all.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Shri Mataji:  I mean your self is lost like a drop in the ocean notion. Your self is lost in the ocean of love, say. So all limitations drop off. You become love.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Interviewer: She says it looks simple but it is very difficult. When somebody hurts you, then one tends to react.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Shri Mataji: You see, if somebody hurts you, it is you forgive in the easiest way.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Shri Mataji: But if you are going to feel it, then he is stronger than you.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Shri Mataji: Just forgive. That you will learn in Sahaja Yoga very easily.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Shri Mataji: It's fun.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Yogi: She wants to put a question to me personally.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Yogi: I must say that I had a very strong experience. I was at a public conference of Shri Mataji 18 years ago in Rome.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Yogi: As soon as Shri Mataji entered the room, there was a kind of recognition. It seemed to me that I had always known her.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Yogi: Then Shri Mataji gave me this experience of awakening. I immediately felt these vibrations.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Yogi: But more than anything else, I felt inside, apart from this peace, this serenity, a sense of lightness.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Yogi: It seemed to me that it lasted even for several days. It seemed to me to walk down the street, to be lifted from the ground.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Yogi: People who knew me also told me that I had a new light on my face. It was an incredible feeling.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Yogi: It was like falling in love.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Yogi: It was better.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Interviewer: How did the journey continue?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Yogi: Let's say that a few days later you start to think about your ego.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Yogi: It was really our worst nightmare. You start to wonder what you were doing.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Yogi: I went home, I closed all the windows to see if the breeze was real or if there were splashes or various air-conditioning. 

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Yogi:  Then you realize that reality is this.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Yogi: If you put your hands on a person and feel his vibrations, if you feel this finger, it means that it is the liver of that person.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Yogi: Then you go to the big one.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Yogi: You feel the relationships with the Sahaja Yogis.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Yogi: I could say that it is the paradise on earth.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Yogi:  But no one gets there, because no one can realize it if they don't experience it in the first person.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Yogi:  I am saying that Sahaja Yogis is like the paradise on earth.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Shri Mataji: There is paradise within us, ourselves. We just seek it. It's true.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Yogi: She wants to have it.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Shri Mataji: All right.
