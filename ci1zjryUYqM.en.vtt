WEBVTT

00:01:14.138 --> 00:01:16.638
Please be seated.

00:01:21.798 --> 00:01:24.298
Please be seated.

00:01:37.428 --> 00:01:46.658
It was really such a unique day and such a performance.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:58.720
Words really are not sufficient to describe our joy

00:01:58.747 --> 00:02:01.750
but as you are singing today about 'anand vihari'

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.765
I saw all of you becoming ananda viharis absolutely.

00:02:08.081 --> 00:02:13.405
Now we have before us such a great artist.

00:02:13.427 --> 00:02:18.627
His name is, you know Ustad Amjad Ali Khan Sahab

00:02:18.651 --> 00:02:21.417
but have you seen the word Ali there?

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:29.034
Perhaps you do not know that we
worship Ali and Fatima Bi in a puja.

00:02:29.071 --> 00:02:35.663
There’s a regular puja for them, because
to us they are Brahamadeva itself

00:02:35.693 --> 00:02:47.257
and that’s why you will find among these Shia
people, who have got such a talent of expression.

00:02:47.283 --> 00:02:53.027
In the Quran, I am sorry to say that
Mohammed Sahab was tortured so much

00:02:53.027 --> 00:02:58.987
and also later on, as you know, Hassan
and Hussein were killed in Karbella,

00:02:58.995 --> 00:03:03.345
they had no time to talk about the universal nature.

00:03:03.367 --> 00:03:06.815
But such a great book is this Quran.

00:03:06.815 --> 00:03:12.075
We have written now some sort of a commentary on that

00:03:14.152 --> 00:03:21.323
and it’s obvious that he was the
incarnation of the primordial master,

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.823
though he was so humble, he was so much worried

00:03:24.823 --> 00:03:32.153
that he should not be called as divine because
people will again start doing all kinds of ritualism.

00:03:32.167 --> 00:03:39.286
But now you can see, especially on tabla.

00:03:39.307 --> 00:03:42.796
Left side of a musalman is always very strong.

00:03:42.824 --> 00:03:45.324
मानी हुई बात है.
It is a well known fact.

00:03:45.324 --> 00:03:50.814
This is  the blessing of that great incarnation of Ali.

00:03:50.848 --> 00:03:53.348
Brahamadeva incarnated only twice

00:03:53.348 --> 00:03:59.044
One was Ali, who was not understood even
by the followers from Mohammad Sahab.

00:03:59.085 --> 00:04:01.203
It’s always so.

00:04:01.203 --> 00:04:04.823
But we know who he is and we worship him.

00:04:04.823 --> 00:04:10.099
हमारे यहाँ रेग्युलर पूजा होती है उनकी. एक पूजा में से उनकी एक पूजा है.
We regularly have His pooja here.
It is one of the poojas done.

00:04:10.101 --> 00:04:16.426
and by taking his name we have
cured many diabetic patients.

00:04:16.437 --> 00:04:20.856
But before that we have to be
connected with that divine power.

00:04:22.368 --> 00:04:26.758
Now I see two great saints sitting next to Amjad Ali Sahab.

00:04:26.758 --> 00:04:29.958
They are really saints, born
realised. You can see that.

00:04:32.828 --> 00:04:40.438
Otherwise at this young age, they cannot
be so deft. They cannot be you see.

00:04:40.445 --> 00:04:47.177
Such understanding, rapport and deftness from last life!

00:04:47.177 --> 00:04:53.495
Might be they might have been with Tansen or someone
I don’t know, but really they are prodigies.

00:04:53.492 --> 00:05:00.334
And such prodigies are now born to great artists
is also the blessing of the Divine I think.

00:05:00.375 --> 00:05:02.875
You choose your parents no doubt.

00:05:02.875 --> 00:05:13.008
But they should be born to such great artist, itself
it shows their own choice, and they are saints.

00:05:13.918 --> 00:05:23.265
I am happy they have come to Maharashtra because you
know Maharashtrians are absolutely drowned into music.

00:05:23.265 --> 00:05:32.599
We had saints and saints and musicians  saints, all kinds
of things, but we had no saints yet who are playing sarod.

00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:39.018
So such beautiful things you see
nowadays happening in this world,

00:05:39.027 --> 00:05:49.478
that these great people are taking birth in the families
of great artists, because they know the value of this art,

00:05:49.478 --> 00:05:54.218
of this great, classical music art.

00:05:54.252 --> 00:05:58.413
You also now realise. I know
because now you are realised souls

00:05:58.423 --> 00:06:02.413
and you understand it and you
don’t like cheap type music.

00:06:02.443 --> 00:06:06.381
But see their dignity, their style and everything!

00:06:06.401 --> 00:06:11.841
Of course I always felt Amjad
Ali was like my son. Always!

00:06:20.227 --> 00:06:28.977
He is Khan Sahab, he  is a big man I know, but I always felt
that kind of a feeling for him because he has that humility.

00:06:28.977 --> 00:06:38.282
With all that art, with all that creativity he is so humble.

00:06:38.304 --> 00:06:44.714
He is not at all conscious of his own achievements at all.

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:52.987
I give really a great credit to
him and to his two children also.

00:06:52.987 --> 00:06:59.341
You know how difficult it is for me to be your mother
and your guru. It is a very difficult situation.

00:06:59.361 --> 00:07:02.771
In the same way a father being
your guru is very difficult,

00:07:02.771 --> 00:07:07.961
especially for such a music
which requires complete तपश्चर्या

00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:13.712
complete dedication and complete respect of your guru.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:20.777
When he is your father, it’s very difficult. I don’t
know how things are being managed by these children

00:07:20.777 --> 00:07:25.067
and how they have imbibed these things
and such respect for their father.

00:07:25.067 --> 00:07:28.367
Because they see what art he has.

00:07:31.157 --> 00:07:38.467
I feel a great vision is before Me of this great music

00:07:38.481 --> 00:07:43.302
and through music you have seen the chaitanya,
the vibrations are carried everywhere.

00:07:45.323 --> 00:07:54.993
So how far can you think of the dimensions in
which all this beautiful, divine music will spread.

00:07:57.853 --> 00:08:05.428
I invite also Ustad Amjad Ali Khan
Sahab to my house in Cabella.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.414
I am not such a rich person.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:24.662
I won’t be able to really give you, support you,
the way I would like to support all the artists.

00:08:24.694 --> 00:08:31.114
By all the audience, I always say they have got the blessings of the Saraswati, but you must look after their Lakshmi side.

00:08:31.136 --> 00:08:34.278
But I am not so well off I should say.

00:08:34.306 --> 00:08:40.446
Whatever is possible, I would try
to look after, especially there.

00:08:40.466 --> 00:08:42.606
We need your blessings, your love.

00:08:42.636 --> 00:08:48.714
आइए तो सही. देखिए आपका घर है बच्चों को भी ले आइए.
Please do come. It’s your own home. Get children also.

00:08:48.723 --> 00:08:55.171
With what meditative mood he was singing,
just think and he put you into meditation.

00:08:55.206 --> 00:09:01.991
Of course yaman raga  is a
very simple, beautiful raga.

00:09:02.004 --> 00:09:05.315
The way he played and his children.  I must say this

00:09:05.334 --> 00:09:10.465
I’ve never heard such yaman raga
before. Never heard! I must confess.

00:09:11.295 --> 00:09:17.231
I must...  I am the oldest, oldest woman here. I have heard all kinds of people all my life,

00:09:17.276 --> 00:09:20.606
but never such good yaman raga I have heard.

00:09:20.606 --> 00:09:23.626
It’s such a...  you see trigun

00:09:23.626 --> 00:09:28.476
because it was not jugalbandi but
three persons trigunatmika was playing.

00:09:35.993 --> 00:09:42.122
With such poise, such dignity, such beauty!

00:09:42.145 --> 00:09:44.052
You all have enjoyed.

00:09:44.052 --> 00:09:52.784
I don’t know how to thank Amjad Ali Sahab  for coming
himself and bringing his children to give us this joy.

00:10:00.984 --> 00:10:04.804
Also the raga Darbari Kanada,

00:10:04.834 --> 00:10:10.444
which you all appreciate very much and enjoy. But
I think you really got lost with him completely.

00:10:12.479 --> 00:10:19.067
It was very meditative, very, very meditative and
I think all your thoughts had stopped completely.

00:10:19.088 --> 00:10:23.440
You had reached a state of nirvichara.

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:30.180
I also was in another world of music.

00:10:30.228 --> 00:10:39.032
Then the khamaj and the bhajan, which was
the favourite song of Mahatma Gandhi.

00:10:39.032 --> 00:10:46.952
Unfortunately Mahatma Gandhi never knew how
to play any sarod nor he knew how to sing.

00:10:46.971 --> 00:10:50.543
You know I have been with him
as a child for years together.

00:10:50.543 --> 00:10:53.043
But such an interesting person he was

00:10:53.043 --> 00:11:01.083
that he could immediately make out if somebody was
making any mistakes in the tala or in the swaras.

00:11:01.083 --> 00:11:06.903
Surprisingly he never knew Indian
music but he had that spirit within him.

00:11:06.914 --> 00:11:13.735
Immediately he used to say this is
wrong and he respected music very much.

00:11:13.735 --> 00:11:17.985
Very much he respected music and in his music he...

00:11:18.014 --> 00:11:27.125
you know that very well that his भजानवली “list of hymns” was
selected by me quite a lot, especially the first prayers of his.

00:11:27.125 --> 00:11:29.975
He used to ask me,

00:11:29.975 --> 00:11:34.995
though he was a realised soul, he used
people who were of very mundane type,

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:39.965
very ordinary, materialistic people
for the freedom of this country.

00:11:40.002 --> 00:11:50.072
I don’t know, he was like some sort of a पारस पत्थर
as they say who just touches something becomes gold.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:12:02.130
He was that kind of a leader, who gave us such a
great idea of सर्वधर्म स्मानत्व (all religions equal)

00:12:02.127 --> 00:12:05.315
But more than that is in Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:05.367 --> 00:12:10.795
We do not feel that all dharmas are
equal, but we worship all of them.

00:12:17.316 --> 00:12:19.816
इबादत करते हैं सबके.
We worship all.

00:12:20.921 --> 00:12:28.386
All of them, because they were all great people
born on the tree of life as beautiful flowers.

00:12:28.386 --> 00:12:31.546
Now you pluck them and the
dead flowers you fight.

00:12:31.546 --> 00:12:35.806
But they worked only for divinity
and spirituality and nothing else.

00:12:35.835 --> 00:12:38.806
How could they work for anything else?

00:12:38.835 --> 00:12:45.234
But we have as human beings always
tried to make a mess of everything.

00:12:45.253 --> 00:12:53.004
But Sahaja Yoga, all the Sahaja Yogis
worship them

00:12:53.028 --> 00:12:54.998
and this is the difference.

00:12:55.008 --> 00:12:59.678
Just feeling the same way about
say Hindu, Muslims and all that

00:12:59.708 --> 00:13:08.018
is different from to worship Mohammed
Sahab, as well as Shri Rama or Shri Krishna.

00:13:08.023 --> 00:13:12.839
It’s much deeper, because we know they are all one.

00:13:12.876 --> 00:13:15.376
They said the same thing.

00:13:15.376 --> 00:13:19.519
They never wanted to create problems like this

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:35.236
and in the music you find you forget all your differences,
your so-called brands, your countries, nations.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.980
Now you won’t believe there are
55 nations sitting before you.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:43.130
Fifty five nations.

00:13:46.168 --> 00:13:52.333
We have Muslims from Iran, from Algeria, from Tunisia.

00:13:53.393 --> 00:14:03.123
Also there are so many of them, who are
now absolutely achieved a state of Sufi.

00:14:06.502 --> 00:14:12.608
We respect and worship all the great saints.

00:14:14.448 --> 00:14:25.074
In India also we had a very big movement,
I should say, of the great saints.

00:14:25.091 --> 00:14:39.924
As निज़ामुद्दीन ख़ान साहब [Nizamuddin Khan sahab] You know that Nizamuddin
was  another realised soul, Chishti  where they sing in the qawallis.

00:14:39.953 --> 00:14:44.964
They've  never... how could Mohammad Sahab say that
you should not have music? How is it possible?

00:14:46.504 --> 00:14:48.233
How can it be?

00:14:48.263 --> 00:14:50.763
It’s absolutely wrong, impossible.

00:14:51.853 --> 00:14:57.415
There’s not much of a difference
between “Vaishnavajana” and the sufis.

00:14:57.435 --> 00:14:59.255
They are just the same.

00:14:59.265 --> 00:15:07.895
How could he say such a thing and how
could Christ say that you can have wine?

00:15:07.914 --> 00:15:10.414
All this is some sort of a manipulation I think.

00:15:10.414 --> 00:15:14.346
Is impossible. Music is divine.

00:15:14.392 --> 00:15:18.124
Of course cheap type music would be very different.

00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:23.099
But without music how are
you going to worship God?

00:15:23.099 --> 00:15:25.599
How are you going to feel Him?

00:15:25.599 --> 00:15:30.475
Only at the time of meditation, you can be silent.

00:15:30.475 --> 00:15:38.629
But this music, that you have heard today has
shown you how we were all tied in one sutra;

00:15:38.652 --> 00:15:43.462
into one beautiful feeling of one-ness.

00:15:43.486 --> 00:15:45.986
So many countries are here.

00:15:46.021 --> 00:15:49.145
They have never learnt any classical music.

00:15:49.168 --> 00:15:53.645
They don’t know any ragas. They
don’t know any talas. Nothing!

00:15:53.685 --> 00:15:59.475
But the way they appreciate you’ll be surprised,
it’s only because now they have become the spirit.

00:15:59.485 --> 00:16:04.505
रूह बन गयी. They are रूह (spirit) now.

00:16:04.505 --> 00:16:09.335
और रूहानी ज़िंदगी में संगीत का बड़ा कार्य है
And music has a great role in spiritual life,

00:16:09.335 --> 00:16:27.550
इसीलिए मैं इसको बहुत ज़्यादा जितना भी हो सकता है उतना चाहती हूँ की उसे प्रोत्साहन हो उसको प्रमोट करूँ उसको आगे  बड़ाऊ जितना मुझसे बन पड़ता है.
that’s why I want to support it as much as possible, encourage it, promote it, promote it as much as I can.

00:16:27.579 --> 00:16:35.904
क्योंकि दूसरा बड़ा भारी काम मुझे करना है की अनेक लोगों को उस परमात्मा की शक्ति से एकाकारिता दें.
Because I have to do another big heavy work  that to give unity to many people with the power of that God.

00:16:37.014 --> 00:16:49.958
लेकिन ये भी एक संगीत माध्यम् बन गया और जब अमज़द अली साहब जैसे लोग हैं और सफ़ाद हुसैन जैसे ताल्बध्ध लोग हैं तो कुछ मुश्किल नही होगा.
But this also became a musical medium and when there are people like Amjad Ali sahab and rhythmic people like Safad Hussain then nothing will be difficult.

00:16:49.948 --> 00:17:03.809
मैं तो हर बार देखती हूँ की ये नये नये मुखड़े पता नही कहाँ से ले आते हैं हर बार कभी इन्होने रिपीट नही किये. जीतने बार भी सुनिये नये ही मुखड़े बजा लेते हैं पता नही कैसे.
I see every time that I don’t know from where they get these new chorus, they have never repeated them every time.

00:17:04.994 --> 00:17:12.571
सब चीज़ें इतनी सुंदर हैं इतनी दैवीय और इतनी आनंद दाई हैं की उनका वर्णन तो नही किया जा सकता
Everything is so beautiful, so divine and so blissful that it cannot be described,

00:17:14.011 --> 00:17:28.571
लेकिन हमारे सहजयोग में हर योगी के हृदय में आप सब artist के लिए नितांत श्रद्धा और आपको सब बहुत प्रेम और आदर से देखते हैं.
but in our Sahaja Yoga, every yogi has a lot of reverence for all of you artists and looks at you all with great love and respect.

00:17:28.571 --> 00:17:43.046
इसकी ये वजह नही की मेरे ही कारण है इसकी ये भी वजह है की जानते हैं की इनके गाने से हमारी जो अंदर शक्तियाँ है वो दैविक हो जाती है
The reason for this is not because it is because of me, it is also because we know that by singing his songs, our inner powers become divine.

00:17:43.991 --> 00:17:45.853
इन लोग का नूर ही बदल गया
The light [Aura/divine light] of these people has changed,

00:17:45.853 --> 00:17:59.655
मैं तो कहती हू इनके genetics बदल गए सबके और ये चीज़ में जो भी हुआ है जो भी घटित हुआ है जो भी चीज़ बन पड़ी है उसमे आप कलाकारो का बड़ा भारी हाथ है.
I can say that their genetics have changed and you artists have a big hand in whatever has happened, whatever has happened.

00:17:59.637 --> 00:18:03.145
इसलिए मैं आपको बहुत धन्यवाद देती हू इसके लिए.
That’s why I thank you very much for this.

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:13.390
Want to say something now Rajesh?

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:15.159
Gregoire?

00:18:15.167 --> 00:18:18.665
ये कहीं से टोपियाँ लेके आए हैं आपको खुश करने के लिए.
They have got caps from somewhere to please you.

00:18:18.665 --> 00:18:22.807
You are not supposed to wear topis
in front of such great artists.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:25.320
उतारलीजिए. Please remove.

00:18:29.003 --> 00:18:31.023
ये UN मे है
He is in UN.

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:41.372
Shri Mataji it’s very difficult to use words after music
and it’s very difficult to use words after you have spoken.

00:18:44.099 --> 00:18:49.295
We heard many performances of great musicians but,

00:18:49.335 --> 00:19:04.350
as soon as these great artists came in, we felt that we would be in your दरबार at home

00:19:04.366 --> 00:19:13.819
with someone who would play with the strings
of our heart and that’s what happened.

00:19:13.835 --> 00:19:17.829
We were I don’t know where Shri Mataji.

00:19:17.891 --> 00:19:20.947
Certainly in joy.

00:19:20.957 --> 00:19:25.127
We were feeling the closeness.

00:19:25.147 --> 00:19:35.130
We were proud of him as if we
were his children or his family.

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:39.240
This is strange to have such a
feeling for someone one has never met.

00:19:47.301 --> 00:19:54.960
We all see so very much and enjoy the joyful
and buoyant performance of the tabla player

00:19:54.969 --> 00:20:06.922
who was sending notes of merriness and joy and we were
very impressed by the children of the great artist.

00:20:06.922 --> 00:20:19.732
Shri Mataji, on behalf of all the Sahajis of all
the world I would like also to thank Rajesh Shah,

00:20:19.769 --> 00:20:25.607
who has provided us the opportunity
to see you so pleased Shri Mataji,

00:20:25.632 --> 00:20:28.132
because this is what we have enjoyed.

00:20:35.628 --> 00:20:40.655
In so many words, thank you very much
for an exceptional evening. Thank you.

00:20:44.444 --> 00:20:46.944
Here is something small from you all to them.

00:20:49.931 --> 00:20:53.866
ये इन लोगों ने कुछ आपके लिए इंतज़ामात किए हुए हैं.
These people have made some arrangements for you.

00:20:53.898 --> 00:21:00.058
इसको मान लीजिए थोड़ी सी चीज़ सब को मिलकरके जो कुछ हो पाया.
Consider it a small thing, whatever was possible by working together.

00:21:01.842 --> 00:21:05.298
अभी दस दिन हर रोज़ रात को एक एक आर्टिस्ट आते रहे.
Now for ten days, every night let one artist come.

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:20.532
तो हमारे बात को आप टालिएगा नहीं.
Please do come.

00:21:21.073 --> 00:21:23.573
आपको आना होगा कबेला
You have to come to Cabella

00:21:23.794 --> 00:21:31.012
और वहाँ पर एक बहुत ऊपर में ऐसी जगह बनी है कि वहाँ बैठ करके आप बस गाते ही रहिए या बजाते ही रहिए.
and there is such a place at the very top that you just keep on singing or playing while sitting there.

00:21:31.032 --> 00:21:35.359
बहुत सुंदर जगह. एकदम शांत नीरव जगह.
Very beautiful place. Very quiet place.

00:21:35.364 --> 00:21:39.909
आप तो आ चुके हैं, आपने ऊपर की जगह देखी है हमारी?
You have come, have you seen our place above?

00:21:39.956 --> 00:21:44.656
इतमीनान से आइए और रहिए आपकी माँ का घर है आराम से बच्चों को भी ले आइए.
Come and stay in peace, it is your mother’s house, get your children.

00:21:46.486 --> 00:21:58.036
हाँ ज़रूर इनके लिए तो हमने खास चीज़ कही है की ये हमारी साड़ी ज़रूर पहनेंगी. अच्छा?  इनमें तो इतना फ़रक अगया है बाप रे. बहुत खुश.
Yes. Please. We have asked her for a special thing, please do wear this saree. You have changed so much. Very pleased.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.235
माताजी आपका इज़ाज़त हो तो मैं,

00:22:02.235 --> 00:22:04.735
I would like to say a few words.

00:22:06.335 --> 00:22:12.467
On behalf of Mataji, when Pragya Srivastav rang us up,

00:22:12.487 --> 00:22:18.125
she wrote a formal letter and since I
deal with Khan Sahab’s correspondence

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:24.075
I just said in a normal way I started writing
since Mataji said about Lakshmi and Saraswati.

00:22:24.113 --> 00:22:29.024
I have to mention this to you. I wrote that Lakshmi part of it.

00:22:29.012 --> 00:22:33.543
Then she wrote saying Mataji is going to be here and this is a संस्था

00:22:33.569 --> 00:22:38.493
I said you asked me that’s why I wrote. I
didn’t say you have to do anything for us.

00:22:38.526 --> 00:22:46.001
We just need your blessings and I humbly requested
to Pragya ji and told her I’ll be very happy.

00:22:46.031 --> 00:22:51.101
We both will be really honoured and
blessed if Mataji bless the children.

00:22:51.101 --> 00:22:55.151
So this is the first time we plan to
bring mainly because of You Mataji.

00:22:55.183 --> 00:22:56.543
May God Bless.

00:22:56.543 --> 00:23:02.123
and the children and fourteen years
ago when I was with Khan Sahab,

00:23:02.156 --> 00:23:11.906
marrying a handsome man and marrying an artist who is loved by all was a very difficult job for me to face the world

00:23:11.932 --> 00:23:15.502
and I did not know marrying
a musician where I ended.

00:23:15.539 --> 00:23:19.942
And I was very disturbed when I went to
Mataji and I literally started crying.

00:23:19.942 --> 00:23:23.842
She took me to a room and sat with Her.  She blessed me.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:29.682
Ever since then I don’t think I have
ever looked back with Her blessings. And...

00:23:29.716 --> 00:23:33.682
And she has cooled down since then.

00:23:36.486 --> 00:23:48.093
Art and culture I think without the love of people, the listeners and of course the blessings of people like Mataji and God it cannot be music.

00:23:48.093 --> 00:23:55.127
So I think with all Your blessings and all your
blessings Mataji may it flourish more and more.

00:23:55.157 --> 00:23:58.035
May God bless you. May God bless you

00:24:12.329 --> 00:24:16.181
इन लोगों ने इंतज़ाम किया है आपके लिए मेरा कोई इंतज़ाम नहीं है.
These people have organised it for you, I have not done anything.

00:25:05.477 --> 00:25:09.887
इसको बड़ाते जाइएएगा. इस पानी को बड़ाते जाईएगा.
Please take this vibrated water. Keep increasing it.

00:25:14.945 --> 00:25:22.005
तीन डॉक्टर ओं को देल्ही में MD मिल गया है सहज योग मे. बिमरिया ठीक कर दी. Dr Rai आए हुए हैं यहाँ पर.
3 Doctors have got MD in Sahaja Yoga. They have treated diseases. Dr Rai is here.

00:25:22.005 --> 00:25:29.375
इन्होने अभी किताब लिखी हुई है. यहाँ पर बैठे हैं.
He has written a book. He is sitting here.

00:25:37.814 --> 00:25:42.036
कभी कभी शराब जैसी टेस्ट आजाती है. कोई हर्ज़ नहीं.
It tastes like wine sometimes (Referring to the vibrated water) Doesn’t matter.

00:25:43.273 --> 00:25:51.216
This is what happened when Christ vibrated the
water. It became... tasted like the grape juice.

00:25:51.236 --> 00:25:53.736
But they said it was wine.

00:25:53.736 --> 00:25:57.628
But this is the word used in
Hebrew, wine for a grape juice.

00:25:57.687 --> 00:26:00.187
How can you make wine in one minute

00:26:00.187 --> 00:26:07.828
instantaneously? It has to ferment. It has to rot. It has
to become absolutely rotten, otherwise it’s not wine.

00:26:07.838 --> 00:26:10.338
So this is such a misunderstanding.

00:26:14.628 --> 00:26:17.727
That’s why Mohammed Sahab had
to say it again and again.

00:26:17.784 --> 00:26:25.213
इसको माना कर दिया. उस व्क़त सिगरेट नहीं थी तो नानक साहब ने कहाँ आप सिगरेट मत पियो. कोई अच्छी चीज़ें थोड़ी हैं.
Nanak Sahab also said the same. It is not a good thing

00:26:25.243 --> 00:26:29.263
Mataji, मोहम्मद साहब को अज़ान सुनने का बड़ा शौक था. वो भी स्वर की चीज़ है
Mohammad Sahab was very fond of listening to Azan. It is also musical.

00:26:30.247 --> 00:26:31.407
अज़ान जो देते हैं.
Azan

00:26:31.407 --> 00:26:33.917
हाँ.
Yes

00:26:33.947 --> 00:26:36.207
ऐसे सुर में अज़ान देते थे.
He used to give Azaan in such a tone

00:26:36.217 --> 00:26:40.357
उन्होने जितना आपका नमाज़ है, वो नमाज़ क्या चीज़ है मालूम है आपको?
Do you know what Namaaz  is?

00:26:40.339 --> 00:26:44.937
कुण्डलिनी का जागरण. हमारे यहाँ तो मंत्र है अल्लाह हो अकबर.
Awakening of Kundalini. Our mantra here is Allah Ho Akbar.

00:26:44.937 --> 00:26:48.629
उसके बगैर गला नहीं ठीक होगा.
Throat will not heal without it.

00:26:48.653 --> 00:26:57.231
आप ये बात समझ लीजिए की कहाँ मोहम्मद साहब हैं और कहाँ सब लोग हैं और कैसे इनकी रिश्तेदारी है और हम लोग बेकार ही में परेशान हो रहे हैं.
You should understand where Mohammad Sahab is and where all the people are and how are they related and we are unnecessarily getting worried.

00:26:57.245 --> 00:27:06.947
अब ये लोग बैठ ही गए ना उसपे. ये समझने की चीज़ है. और आप लोग पहले समझ सकते हो क्योंकि आप लोग आर्टिस्ट है
Now these people have sat on it, haven’t they? It is something to be understood. And you can understand first because you are artists.

00:27:07.067 --> 00:27:08.887
You must explain to them.

00:27:08.887 --> 00:27:12.317
आप लोग किसी दिन जा करके. आप दिल्ली में रहते हैं ना?
You go someday. You live in Delhi don’t you?

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:16.890
हाँ, Dr साहब आप कभी जा करके समझाइये क्या चीज़ है.
Yes, Dr sir, you go sometime and explain what it is.

00:27:21.186 --> 00:27:29.274
इसको इतनी गहराई से आप जान जाइएगा और असलियत में की ये tangible है. आप महसूस कर सकते हैं.
You will know it so deeply and in reality that it is tangible. you can feel.

00:27:29.274 --> 00:27:31.686
अब उन्होने कहा ना “वैष्णव जन तो तेने कहिये “.
Now he said, “Vaishnav jan to tene kahiye”.

00:27:31.686 --> 00:27:35.236
अब ये सब वैष्णव हैं क्योंकि central path से ये सब उठे हुए हैं.
Now all these are Vaishnavas because they all have risen from the central path.

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:44.906
इस्लिये वैष्णव हैं ये सब. और “जो पीर पराई जाने रे” अब पीर पराई ये लोग दिमाग़ से नही जानते, उंगलियों के इशारे पे.
That's why all of them are Vaishnavas. And “Jo pir parai jaane re” Now these people don’t know about “ peer parayi” not by their mind, on the their fingers

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:49.450
सारा diagnosis उंगलियों पे होता है.
All the diagnosis is done on the fingers.

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:54.050
इसके लिए doctor के पास जाने की ज़रूरत नही, कुछ नही उंगलियों पे बता सकते हैं किसका क्या चक्र पकड़ा है.
There is no need to go to the doctor for this. Everything can be told on the fingers which chakra has been caught.

00:27:54.043 --> 00:27:57.550
किसका नहीं पकड़ा है. कौन realized soul है कौन नही.
Whose has not been caught. Who is a realized soul and who is not.

00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:06.500
ठगा नही सकते क्योंकि वहाँ पहुच गये हैं जहाँ absolute truth है अब इनको कोई ठगा नहीं सकता.
Can’t cheat because they have reached the place where there is absolute truth, now no one can cheat them.

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:13.650
और इस दशा में चाहती हूँ की अपने देश के मुसलमान आजाएँ.
And in this situation, I want the Muslims of our country to come.

00:28:13.649 --> 00:28:18.732
एक तो मुझे कभी कभी रोना आता है देखके बहुत ग़रीबी  में बहुत परेशानी में इतने सालों से है.
Firstly, I feel like crying sometimes seeing that they have been in a lot of trouble in poverty for so many years.

00:28:18.718 --> 00:28:23.732
उनको किसी तरह से वो स्थान मिला ही नही जो मिलना चाहिए था.
Somehow they did not get the place which they should have got.

00:28:23.721 --> 00:28:27.232
कितने सारे आर्टिस्ट हैं जिनको मैं जानती हूँ जो बहुत परेशानी मे है.
There are so many artists whom I know who are in distress.

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:32.292
उसकी वजह ये ही है की हर समय अलग अलग हटाते गये हटाते गये.
The reason for this is that all the time they kept on saying you are separate.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.677
तुम कोई दूसरे, तुम कोई दूसरे.
You someone else, you someone else.

00:28:34.673 --> 00:28:40.186
इसीलये सारी परेशानियाँ है और ग़रीबी इस कदर है की मैं तो देख नही सकती.
That’s why there are so many problems and poverty is so much that I can’t see.

00:28:42.346 --> 00:28:47.166
इतने बड़े बड़े आर्टिस्ट हैं इतने बड़े बड़े आर्टिस्ट हैं और बिल्कुल ग़रीब.
There are so many big artists, so many big artists and very poor.

00:28:49.986 --> 00:29:04.537
जब समझ आएगी तब आएगी समझ. की हम सब एक हैं कIहे के लिए झगड़ा कIहे के लिए. तो आप सहज को समझ लिजिये.
When there is understanding then there will be understanding. That we all are one for what to fight for. So you understand Sahaj.

00:29:04.559 --> 00:29:08.479
ये तो सब वली बैठे हैं आपके सामने. और आप भी वली हो गए अब.
All of them are sitting in front of you. And you have also become one now.

00:29:08.479 --> 00:29:16.509
आपके भी तो हाथ में ठंडक अराही है. देखिए बच्चो से पूचिये. हाथ हमारी और करो बेटा. देखो ऐसे दोनो हाथ करो. दोनो हाथ ऐसे.
You also have coolness in your hands. See, ask the children. Do your hands like this, son. Look, do both hands like this. Both hands like this.

00:29:16.553 --> 00:29:25.543
हमारी और. ऐसे हाथ करिए. दोनो दोनो हाथ. आरही है ठंडक? आरही है ना.
Towards me. Keep hands like this. Both hands. Is it getting cold? Isn’t it?

00:29:25.556 --> 00:29:33.016
ये तो पार ही पैदा हुए हैं. आप देखिए आपके भी अराही  है. आपके  तो आ ही रहे थे पहले भी. आपके आरही हैं बेटा?
They are born realised. You see, you also are feeling it. For you it was coming earlier also. Coming son?.

00:29:33.004 --> 00:29:39.846
इनके तो खूब ज़ोरों में. और यहाँ पर भी सर से भी निकल रहा है. ठंडक सिर से निकल रहा है.
They are very strong. And here also it is coming out of the head. Coldness is coming out of the head.

00:29:44.226 --> 00:29:53.216
यही है इसे ही कहते हैं. यही रूह है. इसिको चैतन्य कहते हैं. कोई रूह कहे चाहे चैत्न्य है तो वही चीज़.
That’s what it’s called. This is the “Ruh.” This is called “Chaitanya." Whether you call it “Ruh” or  “Chaitanya,” it is the same thing.

00:29:56.486 --> 00:29:58.986
So now he is in our family.

00:30:06.436 --> 00:30:11.496
आपको हर देश में रिश्तेदार मिलेंगे. हर देश में, जहाँ भी आप पहुच जाइए.
You will find relatives in every country. In every country, wherever you reach.

00:30:11.499 --> 00:30:17.959
Amjad Ali Khan : माताजी गुलज़ार साहब भी आपकी फॅमिली में हो गए हैं. गुलज़ार साहब भी आए हुए हैं.
Mataji Gulzar sahab has also become in your family. Gulzar sahab has also come.

00:30:17.939 --> 00:30:23.309
गुलज़ार साहब मुझे भूल गए. मैं आपसे मिल चुकी हूँ आपको याद है क्या?
Gulzar sahab forgot me. I have met you, do you remember?

00:30:23.309 --> 00:30:33.024
पूछिए. नही होगा. मैं शास्त्री जी के साथ आई थी. आपके यहा conference हुई थी ना youth उसकी मीना कुमारी जी थीं, दिलीप कुमार थे.
I had come with Shastriji. You had a youth conference, Meena Kumari ji was there, Dilip Kumar was there.

00:30:33.067 --> 00:30:42.123
सब लोग आप भी उसमे तशरीफ़ लाए थे. ये तो कमाल के आर्टिस्ट हैं ये गुलज़ार साहब. क्या लिखते हैं. मैने यही पूछा ये वही गुलज़ार हैं.
Everyone, you also came there. Gulzar sahab is an amazing artist. He writes so well? This is what I asked, is this the same Gulzar sahab?

00:30:42.123 --> 00:30:46.530
मैने आप मैं मिल चुकी हूँ आपसे पहले आप शायद भूल गए होंगे मुझे .
I have met you before, you might have forgotten me.

00:30:46.587 --> 00:30:50.103
मैं भूलती नही एक बार किसी को मिलने के बाद.
I do not forget after meeting someone once.

00:30:52.630 --> 00:31:01.440
आप भी इसमे समाइए. आप बहुत इसके लिए. जानना चाहिये कि इसके लायक आप हैं बहुत.
You are very worthy of it.

00:31:01.657 --> 00:31:10.957
गुलज़ार साहब में बहुत कला है बहुत कला है. इसको पाते ही देखिए चमक जाएँगे.
There is a lot of art in Gulzar sahab, there is a lot of art. See, you will shine as soon as you get it.

00:31:10.997 --> 00:31:21.377
खुश रहिए. साहब बहुत बहुत धन्यवाद. आप लोग वापस जाइएएगा मुंबई?
Stay happy. Thank you very much. Will you go back to Mumbai?

00:31:21.407 --> 00:31:22.527
Amjad Ali Khan : जी हाँ.
Yes

00:31:22.555 --> 00:31:39.398
कब जा रहे हैं वापस ? खाना वाना खाया की नही? [Unclear] मैं भी खाना नही खाती जब तक किसी का प्रोग्राम होता है. [Unclear]
When are you going back? Did you eat or not? I also do not eat food until someone has a program.
