00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:11.600
I was told that we have a very beautiful place
for this puja and I was amazed how everything

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.250
is working out so beautifully for all of you.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.820
You are all very lucky people I must say.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.920
Moreover that this place was called as the
“fort of flowers” and now it was called

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.539
as a “fort of blood”, bloody fort.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.999
But I think with all these flowers it should
become the “fort of flowers” again.

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:40.920
It’s a very, very beautiful place you have
come to.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.819
The vibrations are also very good here.

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:50.899
I’ve been always wondering why Germany was
called as Germany.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:58.549
Germ, germ means sprouting.

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:03.879
Any germ of anything means the sprouting of
it.

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.270
Germinate means to sprout.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:21.040
The sprouting of Sahaja Yoga as I’ve told
you many a times before once taken by Germans

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.960
will be reaching its epitome, its highest
point.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.190
We have had lots of ups and downs, doesn’t
matter.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:47.890
It’s a difficult place and now we have started
really the germination in a proper way.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:55.390
Yesterday I saw the whole sky was filled with
color and light.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.220
As you know that vibrations have light.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:10.391
It’s very light flickering, very small light,
each particle of vibration has and you can

00:02:10.391 --> 00:02:12.280
see that.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:20.950
But when there are too many, then they can
be caught up by your cameras.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.709
But yesterday I think the clouds got vibrated.

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.310
And is a very great thing to get the clouds
vibrated.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.870
If the clouds are vibrated, the rain will
be vibrated.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.780
If the rain is vibrated, the land will be
vibrated.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:54.239
All the crops that are to be germinated will
be vibrated too, so when it goes into the

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.709
body of human beings, they’ll get also vibrations.

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.629
Is the best way now is to vibrate the clouds,
I think, if you have to have many more people

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.469
for Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:12.719
That’s the idea came into My mind last night
that why not vibrate all the clouds, that’s

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:15.799
the best way.

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:33.489
Moreover the vibrations are very tiny bit,
with one point going into a half circle normally.

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:44.760
This half circle then combines to make “Aum”
sometimes, sometimes it makes a chain, sometimes

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.849
it gathers together to make crosses.

00:03:48.849 --> 00:04:00.680
But the basic thing about them is that they
can think, and think very fast, much faster

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.110
than human beings can think.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.659
And they are extremely collective, extremely
collective.

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:16.489
So they move together, thinking the same way,
understanding the same way in an absolute

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:28.220
manner and work out the whole thing in a very
beautiful silent way that you cannot even

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.220
feel.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.600
Now the Kundalini rising, as you have done,
must be a mystery for all of you that how

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.730
can you with your hands raise the Kundalini,
and you must be thinking that, “This must

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:48.570
be some sort of a special power Mother has
given us that we can put our hands to anybody’s

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.910
Kundalini, it rises, then stops at a place
when there is problem and then again it rises.”

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:00.480
Now it’s nothing a mystery for you.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:07.030
You have got now within you the power.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:16.440
Like you can move the water, you can move
the matter, you can move all those things.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:22.680
Animals cannot do that and even if they can
do little bit here and there, they cannot

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.770
transform it for their use.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:34.720
For example, you see the nice brass here,
you see nice silver there, there’s a little

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.930
Ganesha sitting there.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:45.000
All these have been transformed from something
that is dead, which animals cannot do.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:53.660
As you become the master of living work – now
you are the masters of living work now, not

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:54.740
of the dead.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:05.290
So the living force you can manage and mould
it and use it for your own purpose.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:11.180
But the most surprising thing is that you
are not even aware of it, that you are doing

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.180
it.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:18.000
Like when you are doing, say a little elephant
like that, you are aware and you know that

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.930
you are doing something great.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.220
And you will tell, “Oh, I have made such
and such thing, such a nice place I have done.”

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:29.400
You’ll be conscious of it because you have
got ego.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:35.040
But when you are giving Realization to people,
you are not aware, because you have no ego.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.800
And what you say, “Mother, it’s not coming
up, see it’s just catching on Vishuddhi,

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.890
it’s not working out.”

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:47.280
You start speaking in third person – you
don’t say, “I can’t do it” or “I

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.280
have done it.”

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.280
“It’s worked out.”

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.100
Only when it’s worked out, I see your faces
and I know it’s done.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:07:00.420
So you are not even aware of it, you are not
even conscious of it and there’s no ego

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.420
about it.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.640
You don’t take any credit for that, you
just feel joyous.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:11.830
Like so many people came for your workshop
– “Oh, it was so great, Mother.”

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.680
What was great was you.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.350
It was you who was doing all the job.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.990
You were working it out but you don’t feel
that way.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:27.620
The reason is that you are now working in
a way that we call as akarma.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:33.550
Akarma is that when you do something but you
do not feel you are doing something.

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:37.590
When you are not conscious of it, that is
akarma.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:42.880
When you are doing something, and you think
that you are doing this work, that work, that

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.880
thing, then it is a karma.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.470
But now the karma has become an akarma, not
that you are not doing anything.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:55.550
You are doing so many things but you do not
feel that you are doing it because you have

00:07:55.550 --> 00:08:00.340
now doing been doing akarma and all living
work is akarma.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:07.800
Like the Mother Earth, She sprouts seeds – She
is not aware of it.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:14.670
In the same way you people are raising the
Kundalini, you are not aware of it.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:19.080
And when you are not aware of it, you don’t
even want to think, “How it is happening?

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:24.020
See me, a human being raising a hand like
this definitely the Kundalini rises, I see

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.430
it comes out of the head.

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:28.010
It happens, I see this, it’s a fact.

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:32.340
Then how is it that this is happening?

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.570
What is the process?

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.830
What is the procedure?

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.039
How it has worked?

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:42.070
Did I make any mistakes?”

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:43.430
You never think like that.

00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:46.190
“Did I do it in a wrong manner?”

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:47.190
You don’t think.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:49.780
Sir, just you start – raise the Kundalini.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:55.720
You just don’t bother to find out, “Have
I given myself a bandhan or not?

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.350
Have I seen the gentleman what his vibrations
are like?”

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.870
No, you just go ahead, raise your hands, yes.

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:07.860
You are quite aware of one thing: that you
are a realized soul and that you can raise

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.490
the Kundalini.

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:13.180
Yesterday I saw so many Sahaja Yogis walked
in.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.990
I said, “Now come along, give them Realization.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:22.440
Just stood there, did like this, did like
that – finished.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:27.280
You did not even think you have done such
a great living work, that you have raised

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.280
their Kundalini.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.710
Not only that, but it will transform them.

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:34.470
It will give them a new life.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:38.350
There will be some special people, as you
are.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:42.670
You are not even aware that you are some special
people.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:46.120
Ego has vanished.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:51.180
So now you don’t think that you are doing
anything, you think, “It’s Mother is doing

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.180
everything.”

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.520
Even then they give big, big speeches, they
say, “Mother, I never used to speak, I didn’t

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.370
know what was speech.

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:06.100
And now I have become a great speaker, it’s
You, You who is doing it.”

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:13.700
This feeling comes because there is no ego
any more left.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:20.440
Now if you see in the water, if you put a
drop it becomes an ocean, no doubt.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:25.040
But it’s not aware of it that it has become
an ocean, it moves with the ocean.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:33.880
But supposing you see a fish -a fish is free.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:39.810
If she wants, she can move this way, she can
move that way, she can jump up, she can drink

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:44.510
the water, she can do what she likes.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:48.930
But a drop cannot, drop has to be part and
parcel of the whole.

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:53.420
So that was the intermediary stage when you
were animals.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:59.200
Animals were under Paasha, under the bandhan
of God.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.610
So they were doing exactly what was to be
done.

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:08.810
Then you became human beings, where you had
complete freedom to use it as you liked.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:11.890
If you wanted to go heaven, go to heaven.

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:14.741
If you want to go to hell, you can go to hell.

00:11:14.741 --> 00:11:16.589
It’s all are open to you.

00:11:16.589 --> 00:11:32.430
But now after becoming realized souls, you
have become absolutely free people.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:38.770
But in that freedom, you feel Me being there.

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:39.770
Now what is this?

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:47.540
Am I trying to tie you up with something or
am I giving you some chains, or am I guiding

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:54.029
you, or am I all the time sort of a person
with a gun behind you, “Do this, otherwise

00:11:54.029 --> 00:11:55.350
this will happen.”?

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:57.500
That is not so.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:05.660
So what is this new thing that is happening
to Sahaja Yogis, it’s to be understood fully.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:13.260
The new thing is like this, like a fish goes
everywhere, does everything, but has no discretion;

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:21.320
doesn’t know which way to go, what to do,
sometimes get caught up into the – into

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.050
the net of a fisherman.

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:29.330
It can be eaten up by another big fish.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.750
It can be destroyed anytime.

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:38.830
It may just crawl onto the shore and get finished.

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:43.800
So the fish has no discretion.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:48.279
But it has some innate knowledge to save itself
from dangers.

00:12:48.279 --> 00:12:55.800
Now you don’t have any innate knowledge
about it – how to save yourself from dangers,

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.110
how to save yourselves from troubles.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:03.240
No innate knowledge like that – that you
are cautious, you shouldn’t walk this way,

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.230
you shouldn’t go like this, you shouldn’t
give vibrations to somebody, you should not

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:08.230
treat somebody.

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:10.100
No, that’s not there.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:17.000
Innately you don’t have this knowledge,
that we should try to save ourselves, we should

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.470
go from the right side, not from the left
side, it would be inauspicious, not so much.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.920
Still you always do right things.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:31.890
Whichever time you will choose will be the
right auspicious time.

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:36.140
You don’t have to consult books on that.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:46.100
Like once it happened in Lonavala, we had
a puja, and it was to be at 10 o’clock as

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.640
it was here.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:54.610
I wouldn’t go for My bath for quite some
time and they were quite upset – “Mother,

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:55.610
what’s the matter?”

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:56.610
I said.

00:13:56.610 --> 00:14:00.180
“It’s all right, let’s go ahead and
see” … was talking here, there, there,

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.920
there… then I went for My bath at about
11 o’clock.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:12.390
When I come back it was 12 o’clock, the
sun had gone to the other side.

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:15.680
So they said, er … they were little upset.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:21.250
I said, “Now, bring the panchar” – the
one which where all the timings are written

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:22.600
about the moon.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:27.260
So till 11 o’clock there was amavasya.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.870
Amavasya is the day when there is no moon
in the sky.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:39.649
So I can’t take my bath in amavasya and
you cannot have puja otherwise, so I had to

00:14:39.649 --> 00:14:40.649
wait.

00:14:40.649 --> 00:14:41.649
They were amazed.

00:14:41.649 --> 00:14:44.500
They said, “We had consulted the panchar.”

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:46.720
I said, “Which one?”

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:54.459
And you see, they saw, they were surprised
that how is it that Mother could tell about

00:14:54.459 --> 00:14:56.660
amavasya and this and that.

00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:02.370
Because the discretion, the knowledge of discretion,
is built within you.

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:11.010
So whatever you do, whatever way you work
it out, is built-in with you.

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:13.220
You know how to do it.

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:19.040
For example, for a human being, if you prick
him with a pin, immediately his hand will

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.040
lift it.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.140
Who has told him to do that?

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:23.720
Who has taught him to do that?

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:30.320
No, in his consciousness it is built that
once you are pricked, immediately your hand

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.519
will go out, automatically with a reflex action.

00:15:34.519 --> 00:15:42.029
So the reflex action to auspiciousness, reflex
action to your saving, reflex action to everything,

00:15:42.029 --> 00:15:44.540
is built-in within you.

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:48.900
And once you become a Sahaja Yogi, immediately
you will start giving yourself a bandhan,

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:50.580
you’ll start giving others a bandhan.

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:56.060
You don’t have to think about it, a reflex
action, you will do whatever you will do,

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.410
will be auspicious.

00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:00.250
Whatever you will do, will be beautiful.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:03.060
Whatever you’ll ask, will be beautiful.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:09.450
Like this place you got it and people are
amazed – how do we get it?

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:12.970
But in the beginning you have to develop,
you have to mature.

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:17.660
Unless and until you are matured, you do not
get that discretion.

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:23.230
Like when we were trying to get a place in
London, I went with some Sahaja Yogis to find

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:24.230
out the place.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.510
Now all kinds of funny places they were liking.

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:31.080
I said, “The vibrations are so bad, these
people are not feeling any vibrations or anything.”

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:35.210
I wouldn’t even get in the place, I’d
say, “No, no, no, no this is no good.”

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:36.680
They said, “No, this has character, this
has that.”

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:40.390
I said, “This character all that doesn’t
count with Me, you see.

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:44.110
So they said, “But Mother, how are we going
to get a good place and…”

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:45.460
I said, “We’ll get it.

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:46.750
[And you…]

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:56.800
I was traveling by a plane, in the plane I
opened a magazine and there I found Shudy

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.970
Camp.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:03.970
When I went back, I said, “Now this is the
place for us, let’s go and have a look.”

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:07.069
And there it was, and we found such a beautiful
place.

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:14.620
So, we should allow, see, things to work out,
have patience, things will work out automatically

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:19.480
because now the whole of the cosmos is with
us.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:23.740
The whole of the discretion of the cosmos
is with us.

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:27.660
The vibrations that think are there.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:31.730
The vibrations that guide are with us.

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:34.970
The vibrations that organize are with us.

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:36.520
Let them organize us.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:43.630
We are playing into their hands by which we
are not bound, but we are helped.

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:47.540
Like supposing you have a baby, you have to
look after the baby.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.750
But if there’s somebody, she says, “All
right, let me look after your baby.”

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:53.030
She says, “All right.”

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:55.540
Then you go to sleep.

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:59.170
There’s somebody who says, “All right,
don’t you worry, I’ll make a nice bed

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:00.310
for you.”

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:01.310
So he says, “All right.”

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:02.830
So they make a nice bed for him.

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:07.280
Then you sleep there, there’s somebody to
cover you, nicely you are covered.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:12.950
Then they say, “All right, you have to now
go for your bath -see the bath’s ready for

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:15.220
you, come along have your bath.”

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:19.660
Then you want to have your puja -“All right,
there’s a nice place for you, come along

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:20.660
have this.”

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:21.670
You want to have an ashram?

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:25.000
“All right, there’s a nice place for you
available, have it.”

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.220
So it is not that you are bound by them.

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.400
This is the point I am trying to make.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:35.220
But you are invited, you are treated with
great respect and regard and everybody at

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.280
your service.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:40.420
You say, “Mother, You come in my head”,
I’ll come in your head.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.390
You say, “Come in my heart”, I’ll come
in your heart.

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:45.830
You say, “Come in my hands”, I’ll come
in your hands.

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:52.950
So the whole of the cosmos is at your service
as if you are on the stage now, doing the

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:54.890
job for Me.

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:58.120
Now to think that you are under bondage is
a wrong thing.

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:05.331
There’s no bondage, on the contrary the
people who are ganas, who are angels, who

00:19:05.331 --> 00:19:10.980
are deities, are anxious to do whatever is
possible to please you, to keep you happy.

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:19.070
If you say, “Now the Kundalini has to raise”,
all right they are all there to help you.

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:24.400
Anything you want can be done, but first of
all what you need is maturity.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:30.330
And for maturity, one has to understand that
there is a culture of the spirit.

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:39.330
As we have human cultures, we have culture
of the spirit which must be imbibed.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:50.400
The culture of the spirit is to be imbibed.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:20:00.360
If you go according to the culture of the
spirit, then you cannot have problems, and

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:05.090
the foremost thing in the culture of spirit
is that you must respect yourself because

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:09.370
you are an yogi.

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:16.250
Second thing is you must respect other yogi,
because they are yogis.

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:24.110
Like I have told you before in Ganapatipule,
there was one tailor, Namadeva, who was a

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:32.900
saint and he went to see another one who was
just a potter.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:40.000
And the potter was mixing the mud with water
with his feet, he was working there when Namadeva

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.890
went and saw him.

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:49.910
He saw him and what he says, “Nirgunachya
bheti alo sagunashi”, meaning “I came

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:56.200
to see here formless, the vibrations, the
Chaitanya.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.200
Formless – nirgun.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:02.700
I came to see a nirgun, meet nirguna [formless]
but here it is in sagun [form].

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:06.450
You are the one who is in form of that chaitanya.”

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:13.049
What a place, just think: one Sahaja Yogi
saying to another, “Oh God, I just came

00:21:13.049 --> 00:21:20.800
here to meet the nirguna, the nirachara, and
whom do I meet here is the saguna, is the…

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:30.520
in the form, in the form, in you I see nothing
but Chaitanya.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:36.850
That is the, that is the respect of the another
yogi or understanding.

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:44.870
Namadeva was an ordinary tailor and was not
a Brahmin, so he was not treated very well

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:53.750
by other Brahmins, and he had to go to Punjab,
or it was said that he was called to Punjab,

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:58.480
and he went to Punjab where Guru Nanaka saw
him.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:04.300
And Guru Nanak said that a great saint has
come to us.

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:09.390
So He kept him with Him, and He said, “You’d
better learn Punjabi because here the people

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:16.660
don’t understand Marathi so learn Punjabi
and make your poems in Punjabi language.”

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:19.920
And he started making poems in Punjabi language.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.960
Now I’ve got Namadeva’s Gatha, so big
is that his book.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:30.391
Half of it is all Punjabi language and then
the poems he makes are so beautiful, they

00:22:30.391 --> 00:22:34.100
are sung in the Guru Granth Sahib they have
in the temple.

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:41.760
You know in all these big temples of gurudwaras
of the Sikhs, they have Guru Granth Sahib.

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:49.940
There the Namadeva is occupying at least one-tenth
of the Guru Granth Sahib and there’s also

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:56.970
Jannabai, another maid-servant who was working
with this Namdev, her poems are also there.

00:22:56.970 --> 00:23:02.900
So how they were respected by each other and
how they understood each other was something

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.200
so great.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.640
But now, it is just the other way around.

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:16.160
We, the people who are false, who are wrong
type of people, who are making money out of

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:23.049
God, who are deceiving people, who are bringing
all wrath and also all the negativity to this

00:23:23.049 --> 00:23:28.840
world, to destroy this world, are respected
by common people.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:35.640
But the Sahaja Yogis must respect another
Sahaja Yogi, till he is a Sahaja Yogi.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:40.240
As long as he is a Sahaja Yogi he must be
respected and understood, is very important.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:48.210
This is the culture of the spirit, in that
we respect all those who are spiritually higher.

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:54.080
Like talking about God, we cannot say things
which are not proper.

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:59.160
Like we cannot say that God is mischievous,
we cannot say.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.780
We are saints.

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:04.200
We have to be very respectful to God.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:10.500
Any place which is sort of representing God
also must be respected.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:16.610
Everything that is godly must be respected,
because that is the culture of the spirit.

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:32.480
It respects all that is godly, all that is
auspicious, all that is beautiful.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.510
In the culture, we do not see superficial
things.

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:43.429
In this culture, we do not yield to anything
because it is expensive or it is with such

00:24:43.429 --> 00:24:46.530
pomp and show or publicity.

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:54.610
What we see in this culture is how far it
is joy-giving.

00:24:54.610 --> 00:25:02.440
Even a small betel nut if somebody gives Me
with love, I’ll keep it with Me.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:07.530
And even if you give Me diamonds without love,
I have no value for them.

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:12.070
They will be lost or they’ll be finished
– good for nothing.

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:21.650
So the love that you put into everything makes
you a Sahaja Yogi.

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:29.220
How you talk to each other, how you deal with
each other, how you look after with each other.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:32.950
How you communicate your love in a pure manner.

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:38.270
Say a Sahaja Yogi should think, “Oh, I must
take this present for other Sahaja Yogis.

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:43.950
I’m going there, then that I’ll meet that
Sahaja Yogi, he’ll be there and he’ll

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:47.210
be there and…” just like your brothers,
see.

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:52.440
“Ah, after such a long time I’ll be meeting
him, and it will be such a nice thing to meet

00:25:52.440 --> 00:26:00.030
him and talk to him and enjoy him and sometimes
also pull his legs and have a nice fun at

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:01.030
him.”

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:10.380
But the whole culture is of love, and if you
do not have that sense of love, if you are

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:18.250
a dry person, or a morose person, or an unhappy
person, then remember you are not a Sahaja

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:19.250
Yogi.

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:28.360
A Sahaja Yogi has to be a smiling, enjoying
personality, making others happy.

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:34.150
That’s the main attitude, main concern should
be.

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:41.230
Next time I’ll be speaking about the spiritual
culture in Diwali when you’ll be there but

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:42.230
this is the beginning.

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:46.940
I have started talking about the new culture
that we have to accept.

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:51.330
In expressing our love we should not be ashamed.

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:56.020
We should not feel shy about it at all, we
are expressing our love and love must be expressed.

00:26:56.020 --> 00:27:01.780
There’s no harm in expressing our love.

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:06.880
But it happens that in the beginning we feel
little shy, we are conditioned, how to express,

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:12.100
people will misunderstand and they will think
that we are wrong type of people.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.940
No, we are special people.

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:19.900
We have to make the whole world, they are
not going to make us.

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:26.830
We have to create the new world and they have
to follow us, we are not going to follow them.

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:32.630
We are the makers of kings and we are the
makers of queens and we are the makers of

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:34.420
everything.

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:37.280
So we have to work it out that way.

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:44.710
We don’t have to bow to their ways and methods
but we have to patronize and look after them

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:51.539
when they come to us first, try to treat them
as if a father would treat a son, and then

00:27:51.539 --> 00:27:58.230
bring him up, mould them and give them love
and make them understand that we are people

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:03.510
of a very, very different domain, of a different
style.

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:10.960
We are absolutely free people and are being
entertained by the Divine, are being looked

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:16.760
after by the Divine, are being helped and
decorated by the Divine.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:24.760
Such a privileged place we have, so let us
be of that dignity and of that morality, that

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.250
we stand up to that.

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:29.020
How can we do something wrong to insult ourself?

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:32.440
We cannot, we are yogijanas and we have to
be like yogis.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.730
May God bless you all!
