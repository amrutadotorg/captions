1981_09_28 Public Program, New York, USA, DP-RAW

00:11:52.295 --> 00:12:02.187
Yesterday I gave you the history of the seeking of human beings, how in three different lines we have been seeking.

00:12:02.295 --> 00:12:15.187
The first one as I told you on the right-hand side, where they were doing something about exciting

00:12:15.295 --> 00:12:26.187
or awakening the deities of the elements, more in Greece and all these places they did these things,

00:12:26.295 --> 00:12:31.187
much more than they did in India. Also in India we had the Vedas,

00:12:31.295 --> 00:12:41.187
in the Vedas whatever they did was just to excite or you can say awaken the deities of the five elements.

00:12:41.295 --> 00:12:47.187
I think you all know what these five elements are, I need not tell about them.

00:12:47.295 --> 00:12:59.187
So this side that we see here is the power of action which enacts through five elements.

00:12:59.295 --> 00:13:10.187
This side is the power as I told you, is the power of desire, which is a power by which you are emotional.

00:13:10.295 --> 00:13:22.187
This emotional power is active as a desire power, and this power that is there which is the Kundalini,

00:13:22.295 --> 00:13:30.187
is the desire to be one with your Spirit, which is not yet manifested,

00:13:30.295 --> 00:13:37.187
that’s why it’s a sleeping power, and called as a residual power.

00:13:37.295 --> 00:13:44.187
Because it has created the whole universe that is you, and still is residual.

00:13:44.295 --> 00:13:54.187
In the center we have another power, by which we have evolved from our amoeba stage to this stage,

00:13:54.295 --> 00:13:58.187
whatever we have achieved is in our central nervous system.

00:13:58.295 --> 00:14:09.187
So we have another system which is the achievement through our evolution, that is called as central nervous system.

00:14:09.295 --> 00:14:17.187
Whatever is in our central nervous system, is the consciousness, is the present.

00:14:17.295 --> 00:14:24.187
So the right-side one, as you see here and the left-hand side one, are also two sympathetic nervous systems:

00:14:24.295 --> 00:14:28.187
this is the left sympathetic nervous system, this is the right sympathetic nervous system.

00:14:28.295 --> 00:14:36.187
But as you are seeing here, it is a subtle – subtle body, and in the gross we can say this is the left sympathetic nervous system,

00:14:36.295 --> 00:14:40.187
this is the right sympathetic nervous system, and this is the parasympathetic nervous system,

00:14:40.295 --> 00:14:47.187
and the central nervous system we have not shown here.

00:14:47.295 --> 00:14:57.187
Whatever you achieve as a human being is perhaps not properly understood also.

00:14:57.295 --> 00:15:02.187
Now you see, if you put an animal in a dirty place, he doesn’t know what is dirty,

00:15:02.295 --> 00:15:09.187
he doesn’t smell anything awful, he doesn’t think it’s something wrong, it can walk into any place.

00:15:09.295 --> 00:15:13.187
While for a human being it is unbearable.

00:15:13.295 --> 00:15:21.187
The achievement of our awareness as a human being is there, but is not complete. Is not full.

00:15:21.295 --> 00:15:29.187
It has not reached its maximum, or optimum, or we can say it has not got yet its own purpose.

00:15:29.295 --> 00:15:34.187
It has not reached its absolute value. And that’s why we are in a confusion.

00:15:34.295 --> 00:15:41.187
The another problem is that when the man raised his head here,

00:15:41.295 --> 00:15:53.187
these two powers started working within him, creating two big institutions called ego and superego.

00:15:53.295 --> 00:16:01.187
And these institutions became like balloons and they met on top of the head here,

00:16:01.295 --> 00:16:06.187
near the fontanel bone area, say about twelve years of age the whole thing gets calcified.

00:16:06.295 --> 00:16:13.187
And when it is calcified, you become the egg, you become separated, you develop your I-ness.

00:16:13.295 --> 00:16:16.187
Before that you are not.

00:16:16.295 --> 00:16:21.187
Now, an animal doesn’t have a problem of ego. I mean, he doesn’t have many problems,

00:16:21.295 --> 00:16:26.187
for example he won’t be bothered if your dollar has a problem.

00:16:26.295 --> 00:16:32.187
He won’t understand about insurances. He won’t understand so many problems that we have created for ourselves.

00:16:32.295 --> 00:16:39.187
But he doesn’t have the possibility, he doesn’t have the possibility to get realization in the first place,

00:16:39.295 --> 00:16:50.187
and another possibility that once he gets realization to know his Spirit.

00:16:50.295 --> 00:16:56.187
Many people have asked Me: “What about animals?”. I said: “Animals cannot get realization”.

00:16:56.295 --> 00:17:03.187
They cannot. Even, say, if there’s an animal if you vibrate that, he may carry the vibrations.

00:17:03.295 --> 00:17:09.187
Even this chair can carry the vibrations. Even these flowers can carry the vibrations.

00:17:09.295 --> 00:17:13.187
They can have vibrations, but they are not aware of them.

00:17:13.295 --> 00:17:18.187
This difference we must understand very clearly, that they are not aware.

00:17:18.295 --> 00:17:26.187
That’s why the people who have found out certain places as the places of worship,

00:17:26.295 --> 00:17:32.187
places of adoration, they are the people who are seers, who were realized souls,

00:17:32.295 --> 00:17:40.187
and they could feel the vibrations in that particular place, and that’s how they selected those places for worship and other things.

00:17:40.295 --> 00:17:46.187
Now for example I went to Kashmir once, with My husband, and we were going in the car,

00:17:46.295 --> 00:17:51.187
and suddenly I felt tremendous vibrations in the air. Cool vibrations.

00:17:51.295 --> 00:17:56.187
And I told My driver, I said, “There must be some temple or something here”.

00:17:56.295 --> 00:18:01.187
He said: “There’s no temple, it’s absolutely a place which is forlorn”.

00:18:01.295 --> 00:18:06.187
But I said: “Must be about 2-3 miles a-here there must be some place of worship of someone”.

00:18:06.295 --> 00:18:11.187
“Oh – he said – there is one”, I said: “Which one?”. “It’s called as Hazratbal”,

00:18:11.295 --> 00:18:17.187
that is one hair of Mohammed Sahib is kept there. And people go to that place. Now,

00:18:17.295 --> 00:18:23.187
so many Muslims go to that place, they don’t know why they go. Some pir, some realized soul,

00:18:23.295 --> 00:18:29.187
must have told that this is a hair of Mohammed Sahib and that’s why there are vibrations, so that hair is kept there.

00:18:29.295 --> 00:18:33.187
They have fought over it, and done all kinds of things, but they don’t know what they are doing.

00:18:33.295 --> 00:18:38.187
So when I went there I saw lots of people were there, and they wouldn’t allow us to go in

00:18:38.295 --> 00:18:45.187
because we were not Muslims according to them, but sitting down there I could feel the vibrations of Mohammed Sahib –

00:18:45.295 --> 00:18:51.187
only one hair of Mohammed Sahib. So you can imagine how powerful these vibrations are.

00:18:51.295 --> 00:18:58.187
Now, when we say that we should not worship – in the Bible it is written that you should not worship anything

00:18:58.295 --> 00:19:04.187
that is reproduced and created by the Mother Earth and the heavens.

00:19:04.295 --> 00:19:08.187
Now what is it, what is it created by the Mother Earth and by the heavens,

00:19:08.295 --> 00:19:16.187
which we should not reproduce? This nobody tries to find out, they think that you are not allowed to worship any form.

00:19:16.295 --> 00:19:25.187
It’s all misinterpretation; it’s completely misinterpretation. I’ll tell you, there is in Paris a church

00:19:25.295 --> 00:19:31.187
called as – what is it called, Gavin? – [Gavin: “Notre Dame”] Notre Dame.

00:19:31.295 --> 00:19:40.187
And the – and the statue of Mary and Christ is so vibrating, from outside you can see the vibrations are coming out.

00:19:40.295 --> 00:19:45.187
Now, this must have been made by some very great artist who was a realized soul.

00:19:45.295 --> 00:19:56.187
For example, the Sistine Chapel in Rome has got a very beautiful frescos of Christ and all that;

00:19:56.295 --> 00:20:01.187
and if you see that Christ, I mean, it’s absolutely vibrating.

00:20:01.295 --> 00:20:11.187
But down below there is a big table on which they have put Christ just bones, miserable creature,

00:20:11.295 --> 00:20:17.187
which is nowhere near Christ, I mean, it’s impossible that Christ could be like that, so miserable,

00:20:17.295 --> 00:20:27.187
ugly-looking, thin, worn out, hopeless case. How can he be Christ, I can’t understand! He carried a complete huge

00:20:27.295 --> 00:20:32.187
big cross upon Himself – do you think these bones could have carried?

00:20:32.295 --> 00:20:39.187
And this was placed just below where in Sistine Chapel you find the Christ standing as He was. How can it be?

00:20:39.295 --> 00:20:44.187
You must understand! And all these miserable things have led to such problems,

00:20:44.295 --> 00:20:50.187
because people think that if you are seeking, you should look the most miserable person.

00:20:50.295 --> 00:20:58.187
If you are a realized soul you should be skeleton. It’s impossible to explain to them that how can it be?

00:20:58.295 --> 00:21:04.187
A person who is a realized soul never suffers. He never suffers.

00:21:04.295 --> 00:21:09.187
The other day – I’m covering this subject before coming to the chakras, because in these few days,

00:21:09.295 --> 00:21:18.187
what I have gathered is that very absurd ideas are crawling upon here in America,

00:21:18.295 --> 00:21:24.187
where people start saying that Buddha said that you must suffer.

00:21:24.295 --> 00:21:30.187
How can He say like that? It’s illogical. Impossible. How can He say that you should suffer?

00:21:30.295 --> 00:21:36.187
Because, when He saw suffering – you know the story: when He went out, He saw an old man,

00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:43.187
He saw a sick man, He saw a dead man. And the idea came into His head that “Why are they suffering?”.

00:21:43.295 --> 00:21:49.187
And then He said: “It is because they are ignorant, they should be enlightened, there should be enlightenment”.

00:21:49.295 --> 00:21:54.187
And then He went round and searched and searched and ultimately He was tired.

00:21:54.295 --> 00:22:03.187
He was sitting down under a banyan tree, when He received His enlightenment, spontaneously.

00:22:03.295 --> 00:22:06.187
How can He say that you must suffer?

00:22:06.295 --> 00:22:11.187
The another myth among Christians is that you must suffer. Why should you suffer?

00:22:11.295 --> 00:22:18.187
Because Christ has suffered for you, isn’t it? Has He suffered or not? If He has suffered for you,

00:22:18.295 --> 00:22:26.187
then why should you suffer any more? Or has He left something for you to be done?

00:22:26.295 --> 00:22:32.187
Was He incomplete in His suffering? Did you want Him to suffer more?

00:22:32.295 --> 00:22:39.187
Actually, this suffering business is the greatest nonsense that I have ever heard.

00:22:39.295 --> 00:22:46.187
The another side of the Christ is the Jews. They said that if you accept Christ – I mean, they were in a way correct,

00:22:46.295 --> 00:22:52.187
that if you accept Christ then you will have to say that you have no suffering. So don’t accept Christ.

00:22:52.295 --> 00:22:56.187
If you don’t accept Christ then “we must suffer”. Alright. So you suffer.

00:22:56.295 --> 00:23:00.187
And they suffered in Germany you know how they suffered.

00:23:00.295 --> 00:23:06.187
Now they have become ego-oriented, they are on the other side, now the shoe is on the other leg.

00:23:06.295 --> 00:23:15.187
All these mythical ideas about God, His incarnations, His aspects, is so man-made that it has become plastic,

00:23:15.295 --> 00:23:22.187
absolutely plastic, and I don’t know how you are going to destroy this plastic from the human brain.

00:23:22.295 --> 00:23:29.187
Is absolutely impossible to convince them that suffering has nothing to do with realized souls.

00:23:29.295 --> 00:23:38.187
Actually, suffering is there when you are lost in a tempest, in the water, you are worried about getting engulfed.

00:23:38.295 --> 00:23:42.187
But if you are put on the boat will you feel the suffering?

00:23:42.295 --> 00:23:49.187
If you are a Christian, if you are a realized soul, you are – if you are really baptized – really,

00:23:49.295 --> 00:23:57.187
not by just putting your hand, and “I baptize you, so-and-so, in the name of this and that”: that has no meaning at all, it’s just a drama!

00:23:57.295 --> 00:24:02.187
You dress up well, take the little baby there, she is dressed well and nobody knows anything what’s happening,

00:24:02.295 --> 00:24:06.187
and they just put the hand – and you just accept it!

00:24:06.295 --> 00:24:13.187
This kind of baptism of course not. But the real baptism, when the Kundalini rises from here,

00:24:13.295 --> 00:24:19.187
She goes up – here She awakens Christ, where He sucks these two things, ego and superego,

00:24:19.295 --> 00:24:25.187
meaning your conditionings and your karmas, both the things, they are sucked in,

00:24:25.295 --> 00:24:28.187
and then the thing there’s an opening here.

00:24:28.295 --> 00:24:33.187
Actually you feel the softness here on your head, just like a child. He said:

00:24:33.295 --> 00:24:37.187
“You have to be like little children to enter into the kingdom of God”.

00:24:37.295 --> 00:24:41.187
Means, what do the children have? They have a soft bone hole here.

00:24:41.295 --> 00:24:49.187
That’s how it becomes, actually it should become physically, and you start feeling the cool breeze coming out of your head.

00:24:49.295 --> 00:24:57.187
So I wanted to clear you on this point, that there is no need for human beings to suffer.

00:24:57.295 --> 00:25:07.187
Only thing they are to be born again. Now again this is another very, very funny situation creating word is “born again”.

00:25:07.295 --> 00:25:15.187
When I came to America last time, everybody was trying to tape Me. I mean, we had much more groups than we have here now,

00:25:15.295 --> 00:25:22.187
I don’t know what has happened to them. They are all shifted, they are not here, God knows where they have gone in America,

00:25:22.295 --> 00:25:26.187
because all the time Americans are shifting, you see, they are not gruhasthas, they are not householders.

00:25:26.295 --> 00:25:31.187
They are all the time shifting from places to places, is impossible to lay hands on anyone.

00:25:31.295 --> 00:25:36.187
So somebody has gone to California, somebody has gone to Caracas, and… I mean, everybody has shifted

00:25:36.295 --> 00:25:44.187
and I don’t know where are they lost. Whatever it is. Now the main thing is that, when I came here,

00:25:44.295 --> 00:25:52.187
I told them that you are to be born again, you are to be realized souls, means actually, I didn’t mean

00:25:52.295 --> 00:25:58.187
that you go to some place and say that “I’m born again”, that sort of a thing I never said.

00:25:58.295 --> 00:26:04.187
And the gentleman who had organized the program in Los Angeles, he was very anxious that he said:

00:26:04.295 --> 00:26:08.187
“Mother, don’t allow anybody to tape Your lectures”. But I said: “What’s the harm?

00:26:08.295 --> 00:26:12.187
I mean, after all, what’s the harm?”. He said: “No, no, but they’ll spread this”. I said: “Very good,

00:26:12.295 --> 00:26:18.187
what do I want out of them is spread the news, alright, now I’ve come and they should get their realization.

00:26:18.295 --> 00:26:22.187
This is a fact, this is the truth, and what is the harm, after all truth is truth!”.

00:26:22.295 --> 00:26:30.187
But I didn’t realize that they were so stupid, so stupid, that they started many organization on that,

00:26:30.295 --> 00:26:35.187
you see, the vibration word came after that, and the “born again”.

00:26:35.295 --> 00:26:38.187
Now, they are ‘born again’, self-certified born-agains. You find them anywhere,

00:26:38.295 --> 00:26:42.187
I met them in America… in Australia, “We are born again”.

00:26:42.295 --> 00:26:48.187
I said: “How?”. “We are born”.I said: “But how? What is your authority?”.“Bible is our authority”.

00:26:48.295 --> 00:26:56.187
I said: “But how do you say that you are born again? You must be collectively conscious, isn’t it?

00:26:56.295 --> 00:26:59.187
Something must take place in you”. They are fanatics!

00:26:59.295 --> 00:27:06.187
These born-agains are nothing but another prototype of Mr. Khomeini, nothing else.

00:27:06.295 --> 00:27:10.187
They are Khomeinis, all these fanatics are nothing but Khomeinis!

00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:17.187
In different names, in different labels, but they are not born again, they are not realized souls,

00:27:17.295 --> 00:27:26.187
because a realized soul is collectively conscious. He is, I’m saying to be. If he becomes.

00:27:26.295 --> 00:27:33.187
It is not just he says that “I am born again”. It’s foolish and stupid to say like that, that I am something.

00:27:33.295 --> 00:27:40.187
Supposing tomorrow I start saying that I am the Governor of this place: they will arrest Me and put Me in the lunatic asylum!

00:27:40.295 --> 00:27:45.187
That is how people have branded themselves “We are this and we are that, and we are that”.

00:27:45.295 --> 00:27:51.187
And the another thing human beings have is to club. They always club together.

00:27:51.295 --> 00:27:56.187
You see, under any name they can club, like in England I met someone, he said:

00:27:56.295 --> 00:28:00.187
“Oh, they are, they belong to our group”. I said: “What is your group doing?”. He said:

00:28:00.295 --> 00:28:06.187
“You see, we, we, we have our fork and spoons put in a different way”. I said:

00:28:06.295 --> 00:28:09.187
“Eh?”. For that they have formed the another group.

00:28:09.295 --> 00:28:15.187
I said: “Really?” “Yes, you see, our forks and spoons are not the way they put it in England, we have another group”.

00:28:15.295 --> 00:28:22.187
I mean, any nonsense they will take up to form a club, or to form a group, or a cult, or a sect,

00:28:22.295 --> 00:28:27.187
or… and then bringing God in between, you know, it is in the, “God has given us this idea”.

00:28:27.295 --> 00:28:34.187
Now, how did you get connected to God? It’s such an absurd thing going on, I mean, these sects

00:28:34.295 --> 00:28:39.187
and all these things I just can’t understand. God has created no sects, nothing.

00:28:39.295 --> 00:28:45.187
He has only created two types of human beings, one who are realized, one who are not.

00:28:45.295 --> 00:28:51.187
There’s no third type. At the most you can say there are seekers and non-seekers,

00:28:51.295 --> 00:28:58.187
at that point where you can say those who are not realized. But I can’t think of any other thing, I mean,

00:28:58.295 --> 00:29:04.187
God has created different type of faces, for example somebody has, say, blond hair,

00:29:04.295 --> 00:29:08.187
somebody has black hair, somebody has white skin, black skin…

00:29:08.295 --> 00:29:14.187
He had to do like that, otherwise we would all have looked like machines, like these chairs that are here,

00:29:14.295 --> 00:29:20.187
we would have had no beauty about us, isn’t it? There would have been no variety,

00:29:20.295 --> 00:29:24.187
such a boring thing to see, all these chairs morning till evening.

00:29:24.295 --> 00:29:31.187
That’s why He created this beauty, He made us so beautiful, by giving us different permutations and combinations,

00:29:31.295 --> 00:29:39.187
and things, it’s such a, such a work He has put in, while we are trying to become machine-like bolts and nuts

00:29:39.295 --> 00:29:48.187
and we become sort of, as they call it the “work”, you see, the work we become of God. Which is absurd.

00:29:48.295 --> 00:29:54.187
Say, in the nature if you see, even one leaf is not just the same like the other leaf.

00:29:54.295 --> 00:30:02.187
Even there. Variety creates the beauty. And all these points, also people are there,

00:30:02.295 --> 00:30:09.187
there might be leagues here for the red hair league, and the black hair league, or maybe any sort of a,

00:30:09.295 --> 00:30:16.187
any nonsensical thing they can use it, you can’t say what, to what extent they can go in forming a club

00:30:16.295 --> 00:30:23.187
Any sort of thing. And here we are to see that we are universally like this.

00:30:23.295 --> 00:30:27.187
Whether you have a black skin or a white skin, whether you have a bald head or a red head,

00:30:27.295 --> 00:30:33.187
you all have this thing inside you. All of you have got this universal thing within you,

00:30:33.295 --> 00:30:39.187
except for the devils. If you are a human being you all have this thing within you.

00:30:39.295 --> 00:30:45.187
Now, when I say this to you, you need not accept Me also, because there’s all freedom in Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:45.295 --> 00:30:53.187
If you don’t want to accept, is all right, but don’t deny. As a scientist, you must accept this hypothesis.

00:30:53.295 --> 00:30:59.187
Once you accept the hypothesis, you go ahead with it, see for yourself, if you get your realization,

00:30:59.295 --> 00:31:02.187
then see for yourself, go further and see about it.

00:31:02.295 --> 00:31:10.187
Now, as he said that people are saying here that we should get Shakti from anyone, everyone, is another Guru-shopping business, you see?

00:31:10.295 --> 00:31:18.187
Is – I’ve seen people who sit down and see that how much money they can spend on their seeking.

00:31:18.295 --> 00:31:22.187
So they find out, “Now, if you have to go to X you have to pay two hundred and he is hundred…

00:31:22.295 --> 00:31:27.187
Now, how much money do I have in the bank, how will I balance it, now how many people I can go to?”.

00:31:27.295 --> 00:31:37.187
The idea is, as many things you can buy in the market in that little money, is all – they sit down and plan it out. You see, this is not God.

00:31:37.295 --> 00:31:46.187
But they will be lost with Me because you can’t just purchase Me. You cannot. Neither you can buy Him.

00:31:46.295 --> 00:31:53.187
Now, what to do now, where do I fit in? Then I don’t fit in, because there’s – according to their planning I don’t fit in,

00:31:53.295 --> 00:31:57.187
because I’m supposed to get some money out of it.

00:31:57.295 --> 00:32:04.187
And it’s such a funny sort of a clownish behavior towards religion that I was flabbergasted,

00:32:04.295 --> 00:32:10.187
when I started seeing people here, I mean, I came here no doubt, but I refused to come for nine years.

00:32:10.295 --> 00:32:16.187
I said, ‘Now these people only think of dollars, dollars, dollars: when are they going to think of God?”.

00:32:16.295 --> 00:32:29.187
How much money did Christ charge you? You sold Him for thirty rupees. You sold Him.

00:32:29.295 --> 00:32:38.187
Did He charge any money? He lived like a carpenter’s son. He had only two tunics to wear.

00:32:38.295 --> 00:32:44.187
He lived with that, but He was the king. Because such people do not care for anything, you see,

00:32:44.295 --> 00:32:50.187
nothing can make them tempted too. For such people it’s alright.

00:32:50.295 --> 00:32:55.187
If you make Me sleep on the ground it’s alright! If you make Me sleep in a palace is alright,

00:32:55.295 --> 00:33:01.187
for such people they are kings they are above all these things, you cannot lure them into anything.

00:33:01.295 --> 00:33:08.187
And that’s what was before you, Christ. Christ came on this earth before Me.

00:33:08.295 --> 00:33:15.187
Told you that what is important is your Spirit. Look after your Spirit.

00:33:15.295 --> 00:33:25.187
And you raised your churches, and you raised all these buildings, and all these places – where is the Spirit?

00:33:25.295 --> 00:33:30.187
The Spirit is missing. We have to pay attention to our Spirit.

00:33:30.295 --> 00:33:36.187
He has said it in many, many words, “You are to be born again”. It is, He said it,

00:33:36.295 --> 00:33:43.187
“You put Me in your heart”, all that was possible in that language, to these fishermen,

00:33:43.295 --> 00:33:50.187
He told. Of course they have honestly quoted all that, but not all that what He said.

00:33:50.295 --> 00:33:55.187
Because He also lived only for three, four years there, and He was crucified. I mean,

00:33:55.295 --> 00:34:04.187
imagine the stupidity of people to crucify Christ. I can tell you, if He comes to America today you may crucify Him.

00:34:04.295 --> 00:34:14.187
Why? Because anybody who cures in this country, he is prosecuted!

00:34:14.295 --> 00:34:21.187
Your legal side is so great, you don’t know the laws of God, you don’t know these Divine laws how they work.

00:34:21.295 --> 00:34:31.187
So let us forget about this one, you are all seekers, you are special people, you are chosen people, you are men of God.

00:34:31.295 --> 00:34:37.187
You are not men of the world. Accept your position. Have your self-esteem.

00:34:37.295 --> 00:34:43.187
You are not the people who are going to seek money, and are going to judge God through money,

00:34:43.295 --> 00:34:49.187
or through positions, or anything. Like these people went to see the medias

00:34:49.295 --> 00:35:00.187
and they were only impressed by My husband’s position, imagine! But you are different.

00:35:00.295 --> 00:35:08.187
You are the seekers, you are the seekers of truth, and truth you cannot purchase.

00:35:08.295 --> 00:35:14.187
I’m telling you this because I feel people need some cracking on this point.

00:35:14.295 --> 00:35:20.187
You cannot purchase, you cannot have a course, you cannot demand it.

00:35:20.295 --> 00:35:28.187
It has to work out, it’s a happening, it’s a living happening, it’s a living process, of a living God.

00:35:28.295 --> 00:35:33.187
Christ has said how many times this word ‘living’?

00:35:33.295 --> 00:35:39.187
Which is living, is here, by going to anybody you can get any number of spirits.

00:35:39.295 --> 00:35:44.187
By paying to them you can purchase nothing but spirit and your lunacy.

00:35:44.295 --> 00:35:51.187
You can get epilepsy by paying money, you can get heart attacks, you can get your blood cancers

00:35:51.295 --> 00:35:58.187
and you can get also some horrible types of diseases, which I have seen people are getting,

00:35:58.295 --> 00:36:06.187
these horrible so-called Shakti-Pat people. One has to know, once you become the Spirit

00:36:06.295 --> 00:36:14.187
you become marvelous. Your health must improve, everything must improve.

00:36:14.295 --> 00:36:22.187
So today we are here, on the chakras I have given you the introduction because you will see why you improve in health.

00:36:22.295 --> 00:36:26.187
Why there has to be improvement in health when the Kundalini rises.

00:36:26.295 --> 00:36:33.187
Now at the very outset I will tell you one thing very important, which should not really shock you,

00:36:33.295 --> 00:36:40.187
but you should know is a fact: that this one, is the first center, called as Muladhara chakra.

00:36:40.295 --> 00:36:46.187
Now, the word Muladhara means, Mula means the root. Adhara means the support.

00:36:46.295 --> 00:36:55.187
So this is the support of the root. The root is this, Kundalini, and this is the support of the Kundalini.

00:36:55.295 --> 00:37:04.187
And this is the chakra which is bestowed upon by a deity called Shri Ganesha,

00:37:04.295 --> 00:37:15.187
who is the embodiment of innocence. It is the same deity born at this time as Christ.

00:37:15.295 --> 00:37:22.187
Now one should know that this chakra in the gross controls the pelvic plexus.

00:37:22.295 --> 00:37:30.187
I don’t know how many of you are doctors here. But pelvic plexus also has sub-plexuses which are four in number.

00:37:30.295 --> 00:37:35.187
And they control all our excretory functions, including sex.

00:37:35.295 --> 00:37:43.187
Now, if you see it clearly, it is placed below the Kundalini. Because it’s the innocence.

00:37:43.295 --> 00:37:51.187
In the mud of excretion is put the innocence, because He is innocent.

00:37:51.295 --> 00:38:00.187
A child doesn’t understand sex, does He? He is the eternal Child. Ganesha is the eternal Child.

00:38:00.295 --> 00:38:09.187
Christ is an eternal Innocence. He doesn’t understand sex nor can He marry anyone –

00:38:09.295 --> 00:38:14.187
all these ideas of Christ marrying, I mean, how can you marry a little child?

00:38:14.295 --> 00:38:19.187
He doesn’t develop ego and superego, like human beings do.

00:38:19.295 --> 00:38:28.187
And that’s why the head of the Child is that of an elephant, because elephant is a very, very wise animal

00:38:28.295 --> 00:38:32.187
and there is a story about it, but that I will tell you later on.

00:38:32.295 --> 00:38:43.187
To show that, the person who is bestowing, or we can see [say?] the King who is enthroned here,

00:38:43.295 --> 00:38:53.187
is the one who is a Child, His ego and superego do not meet. He does not have I-ness.

00:38:53.295 --> 00:39:00.187
This is what was the meaning of this. In this center He resides,

00:39:00.295 --> 00:39:07.187
but that shows one thing very clearly: that sex has nothing to do with your realization. Kundalini is above it.

00:39:07.295 --> 00:39:20.187
Only this center informs that somebody is there before you who is authorized to do the job,

00:39:20.295 --> 00:39:29.187
or who is there who has got the authority which is emitting for that person, and that’s how the Kundalini rises.

00:39:29.295 --> 00:39:36.187
Just like sprouting of the seed. This is the primule you can say of the seed which rises,

00:39:36.295 --> 00:39:50.187
but the information comes through this in here, that there is somebody who is an authority, Divine authority.

00:39:50.295 --> 00:39:55.187
Authority word is very, very aggressive, Divine authority is very loving,

00:39:55.295 --> 00:40:00.187
and such a person is there and the Kundalini rises immediately.

00:40:00.295 --> 00:40:04.187
This is how the Kundalini awakening takes place.

00:40:04.295 --> 00:40:09.187
So the first and foremost thing we have to know that sex plays no part in Kundalini awakening.

00:40:09.295 --> 00:40:16.187
People go and learn sex behavior from animals: now, are you going to become animals?

00:40:16.295 --> 00:40:20.187
What is there to learning sex I just don’t, I don’t understand!

00:40:20.295 --> 00:40:25.187
The knowledge is already there, in India nobody talks of sex the way you talk,

00:40:25.295 --> 00:40:31.187
we are producing much more children than you are producing!

00:40:31.295 --> 00:40:37.187
Also there is another reason, as I told you yesterday that no children want to be born in Western countries,

00:40:37.295 --> 00:40:45.187
because they are killed, they are harmed, they are tortured; but in India even a person may have twelve children, he loves the children.

00:40:45.295 --> 00:40:52.187
That may be another reason we are facing that, but one of them is that they know about sex quite alright.

00:40:52.295 --> 00:40:56.187
And they don’t have children which you can call as illegitimate children.

00:40:56.295 --> 00:41:04.187
Very few in India illegitimate children are! Very few people divorce. I mean, they live happily!

00:41:04.295 --> 00:41:09.187
All desires you have developed of your marriage, what have you got are divorced people,

00:41:09.295 --> 00:41:15.187
children are suffering, they are in the orphanage, and the old people are also in the orphanage.

00:41:15.295 --> 00:41:22.187
Ten husbands marry ten wives and they are planted in orphanages. No family system, nothing.

00:41:22.295 --> 00:41:32.187
So one has to understand that sex is placed here and is to be respected as a function,

00:41:32.295 --> 00:41:40.187
and as a private function, specially to be sanctified by the public.

00:41:40.295 --> 00:41:45.187
For example, excretion of any kind: if the public has not sanctioned. For example

00:41:45.295 --> 00:41:52.187
it has not been sanctioned that you go and do something on the street. You’ll be arrested, isn’t it?

00:41:52.295 --> 00:41:59.187
So whatever is not sanctioned to you, if you do like that, because you think you have got your liberties to do it,

00:41:59.295 --> 00:42:04.187
you will be definitely arrested and will be troubled. And we can see it in nature also

00:42:04.295 --> 00:42:11.187
that if you do all these things, you develop horrible diseases.

00:42:11.295 --> 00:42:19.187
I was seeing the statistics of the American nude and I was amazed that 65% young people

00:42:19.295 --> 00:42:27.187
from 25 to 40 years have some sort of a disease which is a secret disease.

00:42:27.295 --> 00:42:35.187
Which is a ugly disease. What a charring thing it is, just think of it. If you go through the statistics you see,

00:42:35.295 --> 00:42:44.187
either they suffer from impotency, or they suffer from horrible diseases which are supposed to be incurable.

00:42:44.295 --> 00:42:58.187
Of the sex origin. If your liberation so-called means license, was a good thing, nature would have been kinder to you. But it is not!

00:42:58.295 --> 00:43:03.187
Apart from anything else, we have got Christ before us. Let’s see, what Christ has to say?

00:43:03.295 --> 00:43:11.187
He said, “Thou shalt not have adultery is said. But I say: Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”.

00:43:11.295 --> 00:43:23.187
See what a powerful statement it is. Because He’s there, near the eyes. Not only the adultery part, but even the eyes.

00:43:23.295 --> 00:43:29.187
And you see here people have their eyes roving all over, like – God knows what’s happening to them.

00:43:29.295 --> 00:43:33.187
They must see every woman who’s passing, every woman must every man who’s passing.

00:43:33.295 --> 00:43:39.187
I don’t know what are they doing, wasting their attention. He has said it so clearly.

00:43:39.295 --> 00:43:48.187
Even in the church when they are sitting, when they are trying to worship Christ, they are doing nothing but flirting!

00:43:48.295 --> 00:43:54.187
Have we no respect for ourselves?!

00:43:54.295 --> 00:44:02.187
First purification point comes here. The first purification comes here. Let us face it.

00:44:02.295 --> 00:44:06.187
Of course you’ll be purified when the Kundalini rises.

00:44:06.295 --> 00:44:12.187
But I must tell you, when this center is catching, the Kundalini is sucked back.

00:44:12.295 --> 00:44:19.187
One has to raise it again and again, and again and again, and again and again, to establish realization.

00:44:19.295 --> 00:44:24.187
You can become a very dry person, an over-sexy person, it can be any perversion,

00:44:24.295 --> 00:44:29.187
or you can be all sorts of perversions, I really don’t even understand, the man becomes a woman,

00:44:29.295 --> 00:44:34.187
and a woman becomes a man, and this and that possession – all sorts of nonsensical things –

00:44:34.295 --> 00:44:39.187
dog becomes a man, and – I mean, I just can’t understand how you are going mad with …

00:44:39.295 --> 00:44:44.187
Hither and thither, all over the places, I mean, I don’t – I really don’t understand, I was so shocked,

00:44:44.295 --> 00:44:53.187
I never knew that such things exist in this world, that human beings have gone to that limit of nonsense.

00:44:53.295 --> 00:45:02.187
Books have been written about it. I met two ladies in, in Basel, very near the German border.

00:45:02.295 --> 00:45:07.187
These two ladies who came to Me were horrid, absolutely horrid.

00:45:07.295 --> 00:45:11.187
And this one was there and she was shaking before Me, and all sorts of things happening to them.

00:45:11.295 --> 00:45:15.187
And I asked her, “What do you do?”. “Oh, You see, we are very qualified”. I said,

00:45:15.295 --> 00:45:19.187
“How?” “We have done all the sophisticated methods of Freud”.

00:45:19.295 --> 00:45:26.187
I said: “Really? Now you have surpassed him or what?”. I could not give them realization!

00:45:26.295 --> 00:45:32.187
I mean, the way you have taken Freud seriously, Christ is absolutely blurred out of your family.

00:45:32.295 --> 00:45:37.187
Christ is only for a cross to be worn, that’s all. But that far, nothing beyond.

00:45:37.295 --> 00:45:43.187
And cross is not the message of Christ, is the resurrection! You are to be resurrected,

00:45:43.295 --> 00:45:48.187
He got His resurrection to prove that you can be resurrected.

00:45:48.295 --> 00:45:54.187
And how are we to resurrect when we have indulged so much into the nonsense of this?

00:45:54.295 --> 00:46:04.187
But still I must tell you, I must confess that the grace of God has poured all its kindness now.

00:46:04.295 --> 00:46:12.187
Really, I tell you, any type of thing is really forgiven. All sins and blasphemy and all that is forgiven

00:46:12.295 --> 00:46:19.187
and you really get your realization. I’ve seen people who are described as one of the worst

00:46:19.295 --> 00:46:28.187
and the worst and the worst of all: they get their realization and that’s how they get their transformation and transmutation.

00:46:28.295 --> 00:46:33.187
It’s surprising how it’s working. It has to work! Because the creation is to be saved.

00:46:33.295 --> 00:46:37.187
It is He who is worried about His creation rather than we are worried.

00:46:39.295 --> 00:46:49.187
So the first chakra I have told you about, has got four – four, we call them petals,

00:46:49.295 --> 00:46:57.187
in Sanskrit language, petals. And these petals have four sub-plexuses to look after.

00:46:57.295 --> 00:47:04.187
Now, when we go to Kundalini, it has got three and a half coils.

00:47:04.295 --> 00:47:11.187
Kundalini is placed there in three and a half coil. Three and a half coil has a special meaning,

00:47:11.295 --> 00:47:16.187
and it is a mathematical calculation, three and a half is, is a mathematical calculation,

00:47:16.295 --> 00:47:23.187
and if you happen to read one of My – I think in the Advent I don’t know if is discussed it (or) not,

00:47:23.295 --> 00:47:29.187
but it’s a mathematical calculation which has got seven – actually if you see there it makes seven chakras,

00:47:29.295 --> 00:47:34.187
if you, if you push it one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, if you draw a straight vertical line.

00:47:34.295 --> 00:47:38.187
And this is also principle is used in our automatic watches,

00:47:38.295 --> 00:47:44.187
the spring that we use is a spiral which has three and a half coils.

00:47:44.295 --> 00:47:46.187
It’s a mathematical coefficience that works out.

00:47:46.295 --> 00:47:53.187
Now this Kundalini is placed in the sacrum bone, called as sacrum, that means Greek knew that it was a sacred bone.

00:47:53.295 --> 00:47:57.187
And it is said that when the body burns, this bone doesn’t burn.

00:47:57.295 --> 00:48:03.187
It remains. Unless and until terrible acid and all these things fall on it, it does not burn.

00:48:03.295 --> 00:48:11.187
And it is a sacred bone. Now. Then, I mean, on Kundalini if I have to speak, I can…

00:48:11.295 --> 00:48:20.187
I must have spoken at least for hours. But we are now going like an introduction to all these chakras, alright?

00:48:20.295 --> 00:48:25.187
And later on you’ll get My tapes from England and you can go through them

00:48:25.295 --> 00:48:31.187
and see for yourself how this Kundalini is a tape recorder within us. She tapes everything.

00:48:31.295 --> 00:48:39.187
And She has got all the information as to what you have done, where you have been.

00:48:39.295 --> 00:48:44.187
As soon as the Kundalini rises, you get the information on the fingers,

00:48:44.295 --> 00:48:49.187
the realized souls get the information on the fingers. She gives information – he is catching there,

00:48:49.295 --> 00:48:54.187
is catching here, this is the problem, and this is to be corrected.

00:48:54.295 --> 00:49:01.187
I’ve seen people have got Kundalini – you’ll be amazed – so wounded, so many holes,

00:49:01.295 --> 00:49:06.187
it’s just trying to rise, you know, it’s absolutely desperate.

00:49:06.295 --> 00:49:15.187
It flexes at this side, that side, it cannot rise. And again it falls out, limp down, and it wants help.

00:49:15.295 --> 00:49:22.187
If this chakra (maybe the Muladhara) is catching, or this chakra is catching , then you find a big pulsation in that area,

00:49:22.295 --> 00:49:27.187
I mean you will see terrible pulsation. Just like a heart, you can see with your …

00:49:27.295 --> 00:49:30.187
But this chakra if it’s catching, specially on the left side,

00:49:30.295 --> 00:49:39.187
means – the left side – means that a person is possessed. Unauthorized person has put some possession into him.

00:49:39.295 --> 00:49:44.187
Such a person gets specially this pulsation very strong in this area.

00:49:44.295 --> 00:49:52.187
You can see it very clearly this pulsation in people who have got a catch,

00:49:52.295 --> 00:49:59.187
in the way the Swadhistan chakra caught up on the left hand side, you get it – the nearer it is, the worse it is.

00:49:59.295 --> 00:50:05.187
It starts pulsating because it is trying to push itself, it wants to get out of the barrier,

00:50:05.295 --> 00:50:12.187
and that’s why it makes a tremendous effort to come out. But it does not. And then it sets back again.

00:50:12.295 --> 00:50:21.187
And again it tries. And I have seen that unless and until you clear this chakra, it doesn’t come up.

00:50:21.295 --> 00:50:26.187
Now, when you come to this chakra, which is the second as we said, why we said –

00:50:26.295 --> 00:50:33.187
because this is connected with this like a, we can say a stock of a lotus.

00:50:33.295 --> 00:50:43.187
Now, this chakra is the chakra of our seeking. Navel chakra. It’s called as Nabhi chakra.

00:50:43.295 --> 00:50:55.187
This center is responsible for our evolution, up till now. Like from amoeba to this stage we became because of the power of this center.

00:50:55.295 --> 00:51:03.187
And this center is occupied by the Father figure, whom we call as Narayana. Lakshmi Narayana.

00:51:03.295 --> 00:51:09.187
Is the One, is the Father aspect of God. Now, one can say there is only one God. Yes, there is only one God.

00:51:09.295 --> 00:51:16.187
No doubt, there’s only one God. There are not many Gods. But God, who is One, has many aspects.

00:51:16.295 --> 00:51:24.187
Like you can be a doctor, you can be a husband, you can be a father, you could be a son.

00:51:24.295 --> 00:51:28.187
Now you can’t say there’s only one man. I mean, then, God is not like Rock of Gibraltar,

00:51:28.295 --> 00:51:37.187
that He, He has no other aspects; but even Rock of Gibraltar, if you go and study, it has got different cells of which it is made.

00:51:37.295 --> 00:51:42.187
So God has different aspects, and in those different aspects He acts differently.

00:51:42.295 --> 00:51:47.187
There’s only one God who does this, but His aspects are different.

00:51:47.295 --> 00:51:59.187
Now, the first aspect of God is the desire of God that He wants to create. This desire is represented by this power of His.

00:51:59.295 --> 00:52:09.187
The another aspect of God is here, by which He wants – He creates, He acts. He acts and creates.

00:52:09.295 --> 00:52:16.187
He is the Creator on this side. Now, the central one is the aspect of God which is the Father,

00:52:16.295 --> 00:52:25.187
which is the One which tries to evolve, improves His image on the reflectors that He has created.

00:52:25.295 --> 00:52:33.187
These are the three functions and three aspects of God. Now this aspect is the aspect of the Spirit here, we say,

00:52:33.295 --> 00:52:46.187
because it’s the One that the Spirit exists all the time, it is changeless, it is eternal, and it does not incarnate.

00:52:46.295 --> 00:52:52.187
In the sense that that aspect, which is the aspect of a witness, does not incarnate.

00:52:52.295 --> 00:52:57.187
That’s the God Almighty, we can say, is called as Sadashiva in Sanskrit language.

00:52:57.295 --> 00:53:07.187
This aspect of God does not incarnate. He never incarnates. But His power is the Adi Shakti, is the Primordial Mother,

00:53:07.295 --> 00:53:15.187
is the Primordial Power, the Primordial Shakti, is the One that creates this whole thing.

00:53:15.295 --> 00:53:20.187
She first creates the left side, and then the right side, and then the central side.

00:53:20.295 --> 00:53:29.187
These are the three powers this Primordial Power has got. And then She puts this Kundalini down there,

00:53:29.295 --> 00:53:41.187
when you become a human being it rises, and makes you aware of that All-pervading Power which is this cool breath which you start feeling.

00:53:41.295 --> 00:53:47.187
So the witness stays in the heart – the witness is the Spirit.

00:53:47.295 --> 00:53:55.187
He is Sat-Chit-Ananda, means He is the truth, He is the attention, and He is the joy.

00:53:55.295 --> 00:54:02.187
When you get your realization, your attention becomes enlightened. Your attention becomes enlightened. How?

00:54:02.295 --> 00:54:07.187
That I can tell you there’s someone here who is one of the first sahaja yogis we had.

00:54:07.295 --> 00:54:15.187
When he got his realization he asked Me: “Mother, my father has not telephoned to me all these days… (unclear due to bad quality of audio)… how is he”.

00:54:15.295 --> 00:54:21.187
I said, “You can feel him, just what is happening to him”. He just put his hands like this (inaudible due to bad quality of audio) and he got a burning here.

00:54:21.295 --> 00:54:28.187
These are the centers of your father. I said, “This one, that means something is wrong with him in the throat,

00:54:28.295 --> 00:54:32.187
maybe he is down with bronchitis, of a serious type”, because it was burning.

00:54:32.295 --> 00:54:36.187
He telephoned to Scotland and the person answered was his mother,

00:54:36.295 --> 00:54:42.187
and she told in the same language, same sentence, that he’s down with very bad bronchitis.

00:54:42.295 --> 00:54:47.187
You can even cure him sitting down. You can, because you are enlightened,

00:54:47.295 --> 00:54:52.187
your attention is enlightened. Enlightened is not just ordinary light.

00:54:52.295 --> 00:55:00.187
Enlightenment means that when you are enlightened with the Divine light, in the real sense, not this artificial one,

00:55:00.295 --> 00:55:11.187
then your attention starts acting. It starts working out. It starts cooperating, coordinating, it’s a telecommunication and everything.

00:55:11.295 --> 00:55:17.187
Apart from that, it loves. And this All-pervading power you have to become.

00:55:17.295 --> 00:55:23.187
Actually we do not know, we are not aware of this. We do not know that there is all-power around us,

00:55:23.295 --> 00:55:28.187
that this All-pervading power is surrounding us, you are not at all aware of this.

00:55:28.295 --> 00:55:36.187
Is like, I say there is all music going on here, and a drama going on here – you won’t believe Me, till I put the television:

00:55:36.295 --> 00:55:41.187
“Oh – you say – yes, it is there”. In the same way, unless and until you are put to the mains,

00:55:41.295 --> 00:55:50.187
you cannot feel that All-pervading power. And that is the Truth. The rest is all just a falsehood.

00:55:50.295 --> 00:55:55.187
Is fake. That’s the only thing that is the Truth is the All-pervading power.

00:55:55.295 --> 00:56:04.187
Whatever that All-pervading power relates to you is the truth. Like when you have that, you ask a question: “Is there God?”.

00:56:04.295 --> 00:56:10.187
You’ll get tremendous flow on your hand. But if you ask about a horrid person, who is not a Guru

00:56:10.295 --> 00:56:16.187
but is a fake person, immediately the vibrations will stop – not only that, sometimes it may burn,

00:56:16.295 --> 00:56:19.187
it may even give you blisters, if you just ask the question.

00:56:19.295 --> 00:56:28.187
It is so surprising, it is so simple, that once you jump into it, the All-pervading power starts emitting

00:56:28.295 --> 00:56:34.187
through you and you become the vehicle of that power, and the master of it.

00:56:34.295 --> 00:56:41.187
Whatever way you want, you can maneuver it, you can know – now for example this gentleman has got the left side problem:

00:56:41.295 --> 00:56:50.187
how did I know? I could feel it within Myself. Now, if you put your left hand towards a person,

00:56:50.295 --> 00:56:57.187
who is a realized soul or who has the power, and put your right hand outside, the whole thing will be cleared out – aren’t you better now? –

00:56:57.295 --> 00:57:01.187
you’ll be much more comfortable, it will go away.

00:57:01.295 --> 00:57:05.187
It has to go away, because the connection is established, now the thing is flowing in,

00:57:05.295 --> 00:57:10.187
and it just – just like the electricity flowing out. It’s so simple! It’s so simple;

00:57:10.295 --> 00:57:15.187
to you this electricity looks very simple because your forefathers have worked for it, and they have brought it down here.

00:57:15.295 --> 00:57:20.187
To you it is just switching on on the light. But how many lives have been lost for this.

00:57:20.295 --> 00:57:24.187
How much mechanism is there, what an organization is there, everything is there.

00:57:24.295 --> 00:57:28.187
But to you it is just switch on, that’s all, finished. It’s so simple.

00:57:28.295 --> 00:57:34.187
So to look at it may look simple, but it’s a tremendous organization that works it out.

00:57:34.295 --> 00:57:43.187
Imagine these centers are built within us with our evolution. This is the center of when we were just carbon, up to carbon point.

00:57:43.295 --> 00:57:51.187
Carbon also is tetravalent. This is also tetravalent. Till we were carbon – carbon is a very pivotal,

00:57:51.295 --> 00:58:00.187
pivotal element in all the elements, if you see the position of carbon; because when carbon started, then only life started coming.

00:58:00.295 --> 00:58:03.187
And this is how we are here up to the carbon point.

00:58:03.295 --> 00:58:09.187
After that we become human beings we start… I mean, life, then we start growing here.

00:58:09.295 --> 00:58:16.187
Now this grew into seven stages. We grew into, say, definitely we say ten stages,

00:58:16.295 --> 00:58:21.187
out of which eight stages brought us up to human level.

00:58:21.295 --> 00:58:25.187
Now as I told you, this is the center of creativity,

00:58:25.295 --> 00:58:32.187
means it creates all the stars and everything within us, it creates all the galaxies and all those things within us,

00:58:32.295 --> 00:58:38.187
and is also responsible for looking after our left side psyche and the right side creativity.

00:58:38.295 --> 00:58:45.187
Say if there is an artist with us, who comes to us, you’ll find his right side Swadhisthana –

00:58:45.295 --> 00:58:49.187
this is the Swadhisthana is (this? Unclear) also you can see here

00:58:49.295 --> 00:58:58.187
immediately you’ll find that he is an artist. Immediately you’ll find that he is giving you hot vibrations on this part,

00:58:58.295 --> 00:59:04.187
means he is an artist, or maybe he has used it too much, a person who is a speaker, or a writer, and all that thing,

00:59:04.295 --> 00:59:09.187
who has used his creative power too much on the right hand side, gives you this feeling.

00:59:09.295 --> 00:59:17.187
The one who has used the left side psyche, like people who have been tampered with their psyche – you see,

00:59:17.295 --> 00:59:25.187
a psychologist, a person who is a psychologist, who is studying psychology – I mean, psychology cannot be studied by people who are not realized souls.

00:59:25.295 --> 00:59:34.187
They should not. They do not know how they are harmed by tampering with others’ psyche.

00:59:34.295 --> 00:59:37.187
They do not know how to protect themselves.

00:59:37.295 --> 00:59:41.187
For a doctor may tie up something to save himself from infections.

00:59:41.295 --> 00:59:45.187
But a psychologist does not know how he is harmed.

00:59:45.295 --> 00:59:50.187
Even if we live with a mad person, or if you go to a lunatic asylum, you catch from that people.

00:59:50.295 --> 00:59:58.187
That’s how your left side gets caught up and you find that left side starts working in such a manner that you develop all left side problems.

00:59:58.295 --> 01:00:07.187
Left side problems are depression, epilepsy – leading to all kinds of modern pressures as they call it,

01:00:07.295 --> 01:00:21.187
guilt, and diffidence, suicide, could be lunacy, all those things come from your left side – and last of all cancer.

01:00:21.295 --> 01:00:27.187
Cancer is caused by the left side problem and not by the right side problem.

01:00:27.295 --> 01:00:32.187
Actually, as a reaction of the right side, if you are too active – you are too active, all the time you are thinking,

01:00:32.295 --> 01:00:36.187
because this center does another very important work.

01:00:36.295 --> 01:00:46.187
It changes, transforms your fat into the cells for the use of your brain which, which is using it for thinking.

01:00:46.295 --> 01:00:52.187
So it goes into tremendous action when you start planning. I mean, here I have seen people plan too much.

01:00:52.295 --> 01:00:57.187
Till they say “All set”. You see, you start from the home: they start planning.

01:00:57.295 --> 01:01:02.187
There is no need to plan, I don’t understand, what is the need to plan to that extent. I mean,

01:01:02.295 --> 01:01:07.187
you are going on the road, there’s no need to plan at all! You have to work it out at the present moment.

01:01:07.295 --> 01:01:12.187
For example supposing I have to book a ticket: then that is done, to be done today.

01:01:12.295 --> 01:01:17.187
Then what is the planning? “That on the eighth I will book…”. What is the need to say that beforehand, I mean,

01:01:17.295 --> 01:01:26.187
when it will come to eighth you book it. But they go on like this and ultimately all plans fail, everything fails.

01:01:26.295 --> 01:01:32.187
You go to a place for example you don’t know. If you say, “Alright, we’ll go to the right”.

01:01:32.295 --> 01:01:41.187
But the maybe there is no road on the right, so are you going to fall into the ditch because you have planned it beforehand that “I will go to the right”?.

01:01:41.295 --> 01:01:46.187
See, you must leave it open! And the same about Kundalini, because the, when the Kundalini rises,

01:01:46.295 --> 01:01:52.187
it’s like a car that has started – it moves, it moves, it moves – supposing it has stopped here.

01:01:52.295 --> 01:01:55.187
And somebody gives you a mantra for this one.

01:01:55.295 --> 01:01:59.187
You’ll spoil this one as well as this is already spoilt.

01:01:59.295 --> 01:02:04.187
So you’ll have a double problem, because you are saying mantra with this one.

01:02:04.295 --> 01:02:09.187
Of course any mantra you say you spoil this in any case. Apart from that,

01:02:09.295 --> 01:02:15.187
you have no connection, nothing, you are not yet realized souls, and you are taking somebody’s name like that.

01:02:15.295 --> 01:02:19.187
For example Rama’s mantra, is Rama is here.

01:02:19.295 --> 01:02:25.187
Many people say Rama’s mantra and they have a problem with this, they can get asthma – physically.

01:02:25.295 --> 01:02:30.187
“Ah, I’m saying Rama’s mantra but I have got asthma”.

01:02:30.295 --> 01:02:36.187
What else, I mean, you must get it. If you, if you have asthma I’ll ask you, “Did you say Rama’s mantra in India?”.

01:02:36.295 --> 01:02:42.187
Absolutely it goes hand in hand, because Rama is stationed here. Alright?

01:02:42.295 --> 01:02:48.187
Now, if you have to take His name, there should be some protocol. What is your authority?

01:02:48.295 --> 01:02:56.187
Why are you taking Rama’s name? Supposing I start taking the name of your President, in his house go there and start shouting

01:02:51.295 --> 01:03:26.187
So, some Rama who is working in your house and has died, or someone like that thing,

01:02:56.295 --> 01:03:02.187
“Oh President, President”, whatever his name is, I start shouting his name. I’ll be arrested or not?

01:03:02.295 --> 01:03:10.187
Or maybe, maybe at that time when you are shouting Rama’s name, maybe some servant with the name of Rama who has died,

01:03:10.295 --> 01:03:15.187
will think that “There’s a call for me”, may come and enter into your being. Mostly it happens,

01:03:15.295 --> 01:03:26.295
because you have no connection with Rama Himself. With Shri Rama you have no connection.

01:03:26.295 --> 01:03:30.187
or maybe around somewhere in the atmosphere these busybodies,

01:03:30.295 --> 01:03:35.187
anybody can enter into you and you can get possessed and you can get this asthma.

01:03:35.295 --> 01:03:43.187
This right side problem is very common with people who are suffering from this trouble.

01:03:43.295 --> 01:03:52.187
And this trouble comes to you because you try to be very individualistic.

01:03:52.295 --> 01:03:57.187
Like, if you are married you don’t want to create good relationships…

01:03:57.295 --> 01:04:01.187
Can you ask him to go down, he is distracting everyone. Alright?

01:04:01.295 --> 01:04:11.187
Can you ask him to come to the, to the – tomorrow, day-after-tomorrow to our place, where I will treat him. Alright?

01:04:11.295 --> 01:04:23.187
He can sit there also. Alright? I’ll cure him tomorrow. Or after the program I’ll try.

01:04:23.295 --> 01:04:28.187
It’s moving, the thing is moving in him, you see, from places to places, and one has to take to it.

01:04:28.295 --> 01:04:34.187
There are so many here, I’ve seen so many, such strange people I’ve met on the street, such strange people.

01:04:34.295 --> 01:04:40.187
There are so many, I mean, if you, I don’t know what is the percentage of lunatics in this country,

01:04:40.295 --> 01:04:45.187
but schizophrenic and all sorts of people, I mean you can’t say, I mean – just see, every third person

01:04:45.295 --> 01:04:48.187
I came across has some sort of a funny thing going on in his head.

01:04:48.295 --> 01:04:53.187
I said, “Now what is it – this is the country which is invaded the most by these negative forces.

01:04:53.295 --> 01:04:59.187
And if you are going to be destroyed, you are going to be destroyed from inside, not from outside.

01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:05.187
You will not be destroyed from outside. Take it from Me. You’ll be destroyed from inside.

01:05:05.295 --> 01:05:10.187
And that you can see what’s happening, all kinds of destructive forces are working it out.

01:05:10.295 --> 01:05:15.187
And the worst of all, these horrible gurus who have come from India.

01:05:15.295 --> 01:05:23.187
You people had invasion on India. English had their political invasion, you had your monetary invasion on India.

01:05:23.295 --> 01:05:29.187
So all these horrible people are having a mental invasion on you – you are not aware of it.

01:05:29.295 --> 01:05:34.187
It’s a mental invasion on you. Very subtle mental invasion which you cannot discern –

01:05:34.295 --> 01:05:38.187
you are enslaved, as we were enslaved by you for money.

01:05:38.295 --> 01:05:44.187
You see, for wheat, if they send horrible wheat to India, Americans used to say “Eh, oh, we have been very gracious”.

01:05:44.295 --> 01:05:49.187
And the wheat was so horrible that we could not eat. We threw it on the grounds, imagine,

01:05:49.295 --> 01:05:57.187
we threw it on the grounds and horrible types of – what you call – acacia plants grew. We cannot destroy them.

01:05:57.295 --> 01:06:01.187
And then another type of grass which we called as Congress grass, you see –

01:06:01.295 --> 01:06:09.187
because it came from America we called it Congress grass – grew all over and it covered all over crops and everything.

01:06:09.295 --> 01:06:13.187
And we, we didn’t know why were you so kind to us to send all these things.

01:06:13.295 --> 01:06:20.187
Somehow it was destroyed then, this grass, but still this horrible acacia is covering all the villages in India,

01:06:20.295 --> 01:06:25.187
people are having a terrible time, they are poisonous; and if they hit you, you see, you are killed.

01:06:25.295 --> 01:06:30.187
And children play around – it’s a very dangerous thing. I mean, if they wanted to send wheat,

01:06:30.295 --> 01:06:34.187
that should have been something more gracious than what they have been doing.

01:06:34.295 --> 01:06:38.187
This is how you have been very, very unpopular all over the world.

01:06:38.295 --> 01:06:41.187
Whenever you try to help anyone, you think, “Oh, you are doing too much”.

01:06:41.295 --> 01:06:47.187
While India has helped you so many ways. First of all it has helped you when you had wars,

01:06:47.295 --> 01:06:51.187
we sent Indian troops and all that all over – we never tried to show anything like that.

01:06:51.295 --> 01:06:58.187
You see, it is surprising how these developed nations are so ego-oriented. So ego-oriented, I mean,

01:06:58.295 --> 01:07:07.187
so many things they have done that I cannot understand how human beings are not afraid of God and His wrath that can come on us.

01:07:07.295 --> 01:07:12.187
We have oppressed all the people who are already oppressed, we have tried to really crash them down.

01:07:12.295 --> 01:07:21.187
Now it is time for you people who are born in this country, who are special people born – you are very, very special,

01:07:21.295 --> 01:07:30.187
in America we have the maximum number of crazy, you would not know; it is for you to rise above all these nonsensical things and get over it.

01:07:30.295 --> 01:07:41.187
And join your hands in solving the problems of these worldly things which has really oppressed the whole universe.

01:07:41.295 --> 01:07:48.187
And I really dependent very much on you people. I came nine years back,

01:07:48.295 --> 01:07:56.187
but I found that the aggression is still bubbling in, they cannot see things; and that’s how these gurus take advantage of it.

01:07:56.295 --> 01:08:01.187
They took advantage of it, they came here: “Alright, you have got money? Pamper your ego, you can purchase us”.

01:08:01.295 --> 01:08:05.187
They pampered your ego, you thought you can pay for them, you paid for them:

01:08:05.295 --> 01:08:14.187
but what did you get out of it? Is nothing but all these horrible things out of which it is very difficult to get out.

01:08:14.295 --> 01:08:18.187
Apart from that, many might have lost their chances of Self-realization.

01:08:18.295 --> 01:08:25.187
You are absolutely special people to be born – you have taken birth in this country with a very, very special purpose.

01:08:25.295 --> 01:08:30.187
Because I told you that you are born in this place, this is America.

01:08:30.295 --> 01:08:37.187
What a place it is. I mean, you had great people like Abraham Lincoln, great people like him, what a man he was, you had.

01:08:37.295 --> 01:08:42.187
You have forgotten him completely, his ideals and things, I mean, what a man is Abraham Lincoln.

01:08:42.295 --> 01:08:46.187
I mean, if I read about anyone in the beginning was Abraham Lincoln, I said “Look at him”.

01:08:46.295 --> 01:08:53.187
He was a realized soul! His ideals and all that are gone off. Now it is for you to establish.

01:08:53.295 --> 01:09:02.187
For what you (have?) to, for what God has created this America, this chakra of Vishuddhi.

01:09:02.295 --> 01:09:07.187
And this is what is starting from here that you rise up to there.

01:09:07.295 --> 01:09:16.187
The connection is that this seeking goes in developing

01:09:16.295 --> 01:09:22.187
and there are ten principles which are described as the Ten Commandments, you can say,

01:09:22.295 --> 01:09:28.187
or we have got ten Sutras, in Sanskrit language they are called as ten Sutras.

01:09:28.295 --> 01:09:34.187
Gandhiji put one more, by saying that we should use only Indian, Indian things, not foreign things,

01:09:34.295 --> 01:09:39.187
because then they will dominate us. So he put ekadesha, he put one more.

01:09:39.295 --> 01:09:45.187
But there are ten, which are here, which are described as Ten Commandments in the Bible.

01:09:45.295 --> 01:09:51.187
And these are the ten Primordial Masters who were born on this earth.

01:09:51.295 --> 01:10:01.187
Say we can start from Socrates, then we can think of other, in India was Dattatreya, is the – Dattatreya is the essence.

01:10:01.295 --> 01:10:09.187
And He is born as Socrates. He is born as Lao-Tse. He is born as Abraham. As Moses.

01:10:09.295 --> 01:10:17.187
He is born as – up till now we can say Mohammed Sahib, Nanaka. Latest is the Sai Nath of Shirdi.

01:10:17.295 --> 01:10:28.187
He’s the One who represents, they all represent this Primordial Master’s principle of religion.

01:10:28.295 --> 01:10:40.187
Religion means the one that sustains us. These ten are our sustenance, is we can say our valences, is our quality.

01:10:40.295 --> 01:10:50.187
Like this gold has a quality that it is untarnishable, in the same way human beings have these ten qualities in them.

01:10:50.295 --> 01:10:54.187
For a dog doesn’t know what is truth and what is untruth.

01:10:54.295 --> 01:11:00.187
Dog doesn’t know what is, what is violence and non-violence.

01:11:00.295 --> 01:11:07.187
Is the human being who knows these ten things. And these are the qualities, ten qualities which are sustained

01:11:07.295 --> 01:11:14.187
by the Primordial Master who is Dattatreya, who has incarnated on this earth basically ten times,

01:11:14.295 --> 01:11:22.187
but there are so many upa-gurus as they call, the subsequent gurus, also who are realized souls.

01:11:22.295 --> 01:11:30.187
Now. At the time of Christ, John the Baptist. I mean, he was a real Baptist, he was not an untrue Baptist, he was a realized soul.

01:11:30.295 --> 01:11:34.187
Nowadays everybody’s a Baptist, without being the real Baptist.

01:11:34.295 --> 01:11:42.187
You have to be the real Baptist – when you are a realized soul, only then you are a real Baptist, not before that.

01:11:42.295 --> 01:11:48.187
And this special thing called as the Primordial Master,

01:11:48.295 --> 01:11:56.187
is also within you. You can become your own Guru. Your Guru Principle is to be awakened.

01:11:56.295 --> 01:12:02.187
If the Kundalini awakens your Guru Principle, you become the Guru.

01:12:02.295 --> 01:12:12.187
You have to become your own Guru. On the left side is the diffidence that you cannot be a Guru. On the right side is the arrogance.

01:12:12.295 --> 01:12:21.187
And that’s how sometimes we, we subject ourselves to others, saying that “You are my guru”.

01:12:21.295 --> 01:12:26.187
And here we are arrogant – when we see a real Guru, we deny it.

01:12:26.295 --> 01:12:31.187
So these two sides are to be seen, and once you work it out…

01:12:31.295 --> 01:12:35.187
For example, this gentleman who was here has a left side. Is the diffidence in him.

01:12:35.295 --> 01:12:41.187
(Please, come in. Eh? Alright. May God bless you. Alright.

01:12:41.295 --> 01:12:48.187
So left side is the one that gives you that diffidence and you subject yourself to other gurus.

01:12:48.295 --> 01:12:53.187
And you can see it on your left side Void, this is the Void.

01:12:53.295 --> 01:13:02.187
You can feel it on the left side Void a burning sensation. And this is a sign that you have been to some guru who has been wrong –

01:13:02.295 --> 01:13:11.187
who is not a realized soul, who is a wrong type of man. Immediately you can make out from the person whether he has been to a right type of a guru or a bad type.

01:13:11.295 --> 01:13:16.187
If you have been to the right type, you get your realization just like that. You are just ready for it.

01:13:16.295 --> 01:13:21.187
He doesn’t spoil your chakras, nothing. He doesn’t give you false ideas. And you are just ready;

01:13:21.295 --> 01:13:25.187
but he has done very great work is to establish this part in your stomach.

01:13:25.295 --> 01:13:35.187
That’s why Moses, Abraham, all of them talked about alcoholism, about these things, because alcohol spoils the liver.

01:13:35.295 --> 01:13:40.187
Christ did not. He was born at that time, so He talked about the eyes.

01:13:40.295 --> 01:13:45.187
He talked about the realization. He talked about the Gate, the Door.

01:13:45.295 --> 01:13:52.187
And that’s why He said you must get your resurrection. So the different aspects came at different time,

01:13:52.295 --> 01:13:57.187
and this aspect of the Primordial Master which was Moses, you can say, Abraham,

01:13:57.295 --> 01:14:03.187
and other people of the same type, they came to establish balance and dharma within us.

01:14:03.295 --> 01:14:08.187
Here they have not shown two other subsidiary chakras. One is the chakra of the sun

01:14:08.295 --> 01:14:12.187
and another is of the moon. This is the moon line and this is the sun line.

01:14:12.295 --> 01:14:15.187
Now this center they should have shown here I think,

01:14:15.295 --> 01:14:21.187
which means that when you are on the sun line, you become right handed.

01:14:21.295 --> 01:14:27.187
Right handed means you are more projecting towards the future, you are thinking too much,

01:14:27.295 --> 01:14:33.187
or you are putting too much attention to your physical being. And not to your Spirit.

01:14:33.295 --> 01:14:39.187
Not to your emotional self. Now, when you start getting to the asceticism, and all sorts of nonsense like that,

01:14:39.295 --> 01:14:44.187
become an ascetic, give up this, give up that, give up that – and you give up actually your brain,

01:14:44.295 --> 01:14:49.187
nothing else – you become a thin person, you start moving like this and develop a horrible liver.

01:14:49.295 --> 01:14:53.187
You see? this liver may extend up to this.

01:14:53.295 --> 01:14:59.187
Now, liver is one of the, one of the very, very special organs we have got within ourselves.

01:14:59.295 --> 01:15:04.187
I mean, you would not know if you have a bad liver till you get to cirrhosis.

01:15:04.295 --> 01:15:10.187
When they will say that: “Now, last time has come, you are in for your funeral”. That’s what it is.

01:15:10.295 --> 01:15:15.187
Liver is like that, it goes on getting bad, bad, bad till you do not know.

01:15:15.295 --> 01:15:20.187
But in Sahaja Yoga immediately you will know you have a liver problem. And you will also know how to cure it.

01:15:20.295 --> 01:15:27.187
And liver is responsible for our attention, which is so important. If your liver is not alright, your attention will be horrid,

01:15:27.295 --> 01:15:33.187
all the time you’ll be feeling sick, frustrated, embittered, you won’t like this, you won’t like that –

01:15:33.295 --> 01:15:39.187
sort of a person, always annoyed, and you will not know “why I do like this, I don’t want to do it,

01:15:39.295 --> 01:15:43.187
but why am I doing like that”. So this is the one one has to look after.

01:15:43.295 --> 01:15:48.187
But when you think too much, as I told you, this center of Swadishtana,

01:15:48.295 --> 01:15:54.187
which is bestowed upon by Brahmadeva, who is the Creator, works too hard,

01:15:54.295 --> 01:16:05.187
and it has no time to look after the other things like the liver, the pancreas, the spleen, the kidneys, and the uterus.

01:16:05.295 --> 01:16:14.187
So these things get completely neglected, and that’s how the people who think too much always get diabetes.

01:16:14.295 --> 01:16:22.187
In Sahaja Yoga diabetes is curable. Hemiplegia and all those things, and anemia and all these things are the cause of the same thing.

01:16:22.295 --> 01:16:29.187
Such people can become so very dry, really very dry because their left side goes absolutely out of order, it’s sleeping.

01:16:29.295 --> 01:16:34.187
They become emotionless. I’ve known people they came to tell Me, “Mother, I have no emotions now,

01:16:34.295 --> 01:16:38.187
I have become a great saint, I have no emotions.” Who has told you?

01:16:38.295 --> 01:16:47.187
I mean, a saint has such emotions you can’t imagine. It’s such a, such a feeling!

01:16:38.295 --> 01:17:26.187
When he sees others in trouble, when he sees others drowning, then the compassion starts flowing from his eyes,

01:16:47.295 --> 01:16:52.187
I mean, if somebody says that he is a saint and he has no emotions, you throw him in the sea.

01:16:52.295 --> 01:16:58.187
He is good for nothing. A person who has no emotions is not a human being, he is worse than an animal.

01:16:58.295 --> 01:17:10.187
And if you see a saint, the difference is only this: that if you feel pained, then you start weeping and becoming emotional.

01:17:10.295 --> 01:17:26.295
But a saint is the other way round. When he sees others in pain, then the compassion fills him completely.

01:17:26.295 --> 01:17:32.187
and you can see the compassion from those eyes, absolutely the same terrific eyes become so compassionate

01:17:32.295 --> 01:17:39.187
that you are surprised that how this love is flowing. And at the same time he can take a hunter in his hand and hit people;

01:17:39.295 --> 01:17:44.187
at the same time he can be very wrathful with people who try to destroy the saints,

01:17:44.295 --> 01:17:50.187
he can be extremely wrathful, and he can be very, very, very, very dynamic.

01:17:50.295 --> 01:18:01.187
He can be anything; but he uses it for the purpose of one thing: is to save the saints and to make them the Spirit.

01:18:01.295 --> 01:18:07.187
His only concern is how to make them the Spirit, and for that how to save them.

01:18:07.295 --> 01:18:15.187
For that, whatever has to do – sometimes it can act like a tigress, just jump on people

01:18:15.295 --> 01:18:24.187
who try to be injurious, or try to be sort of harmful to the children of the tigress.

01:18:24.295 --> 01:18:30.187
Or it can become so mild, so mild: I don’t know if you have seen a crocodile giving bath to her children.

01:18:30.295 --> 01:18:35.187
Her eyes become absolutely so mild, imagine. It’s like that.

01:18:35.295 --> 01:18:43.187
That love you start seeing in a person who is a saint and who becomes a realized soul,

01:18:43.295 --> 01:18:47.187
that he feels for others. Not for himself. He is not bothered!

01:18:47.295 --> 01:18:54.187
Comforts do not matter – where you sit, what you need, “I must have this food”: that all nonsense, never comes in the mind.

01:18:54.295 --> 01:19:00.187
What matters is: “Oh God, what’s happening to these people, these are my children!

01:19:00.295 --> 01:19:05.187
They are seekers, they are saints, they have been seeking for thousands of years.

01:19:05.295 --> 01:19:13.187
How am I to save them?”. And such people who are dry they end up in heart attacks, and another is paralysis.

01:19:13.295 --> 01:19:17.187
I mean, you should never have sympathies for people who have heart troubles.

01:19:17.295 --> 01:19:23.187
Tell them to be more loving. Spend some time with your wife. Spend some time with your children. You see,

01:19:23.295 --> 01:19:31.187
mostly these busy people are those who are at the helm of affairs, who think that the whole world will be drowned without them.

01:19:31.295 --> 01:19:39.187
Actually with them it may be drowned, I don’t know about that part. Such very busy people, you see,

01:19:39.295 --> 01:19:49.187
who have no time to waste in their family and who are holding the banner of some sort of a great thing so-called – t

01:19:49.295 --> 01:19:57.187
hey always get heart attacks and die. If they are not shot off, they are – they get their own heart attacks and die.

01:19:57.295 --> 01:20:05.187
They get – can get even epilepsy, but it’s not actually the epilepsy – it looks like epilepsy

01:20:05.295 --> 01:20:17.187
but it is a kind of a failure of the part of the head which is on this, the ego side.

01:20:17.295 --> 01:20:27.187
And a person can get paralyzed or he may become absolutely without any sensation in his body.

01:20:27.295 --> 01:20:33.187
These people, till they die they are very alert, their brain is very alert, despite the fact they have used their brain.

01:20:33.295 --> 01:20:41.187
Actually the nature is very balanced; they have used their brain, with their brain only they have achieved whatever they wanted to,

01:20:41.295 --> 01:20:46.187
but their brain is alert, but their heart goes out, the balance comes in.

01:20:46.295 --> 01:20:52.187
But if you have used your heart too much, the left side as it is, too much of crying and weeping and this and that and all that,

01:20:52.295 --> 01:21:00.187
you become – on the contrary your heart going out, your brain goes out. The balance is established.

01:21:00.295 --> 01:21:06.187
It’s surprising, that people said that in the mental hospital no use having a cardiogram.

01:21:06.295 --> 01:21:11.187
There’s no need because you don’t need it. Their heart is perfect.

01:21:11.295 --> 01:21:14.187
While they use their heart all the time, the brain goes out.

01:21:14.295 --> 01:21:21.187
And you become a brainless person or a gaga person, I don’t know all sorts of things that people get.

01:21:21.295 --> 01:21:26.187
So one has to understand that a balance is brought about by this position,

01:21:26.295 --> 01:21:31.187
and that’s why Buddha has said “Keep in the center. Do not go to extremes”.

01:21:31.295 --> 01:21:35.187
When you go into extremes, this moves in the periphery.

01:21:35.295 --> 01:21:41.187
Supposing you are a thinker and you plan everything and you are meticulous, and this and that,

01:21:41.295 --> 01:21:43.187
you are thrown out of the way.

01:21:43.295 --> 01:21:50.187
Now, the extreme thing of this could create a very egoistical supra-conscious spirit in you.

01:21:50.295 --> 01:22:00.187
The one who we can cite was Mr. Hitler. Mr. Hitler was nothing else but a person who lived in the collective supra-conscious.

01:22:00.295 --> 01:22:07.187
And he charmed people by his collective consciousness – collective supra-consciousness.

01:22:07.295 --> 01:22:15.187
What he did is to talk so big and so nonsensical things, if you read his lectures you’ll be amazed,

01:22:15.295 --> 01:22:24.187
that he said that: “We are the Germans, we are the special race, we are this and we should kill all these people”, and people believed it!

01:22:24.295 --> 01:22:32.187
It was just a possession, a collective possession. I mean, if you talk to those Germans now, I read some articles written by them,

01:22:32.295 --> 01:22:39.187
really they can’t understand, they said, “We were young people, we were studying, we were students, we were very good people,

01:22:39.295 --> 01:22:47.187
and suddenly all this came up to us and he built us up as some sort of a martyr and all that, and we took to it”.

01:22:47.295 --> 01:22:53.187
He made it such a big religious stuff, I mean, a fanatic thing in their head, that they accepted it.

01:22:53.295 --> 01:22:59.187
This is the extreme case of fanaticism. All the fanatics are on this side. All of them are on this side.

01:22:59.295 --> 01:23:05.187
Any fanaticism I am facing. Keep away from them. They are headaches, they are bores, numbering bores.

01:23:05.295 --> 01:23:11.187
You just can’t talk to them. All the fanatics of the world if they were bores it’s all right,

01:23:11.295 --> 01:23:17.187
but they go much beyond that. Like you see Khomeini’s there. He is a good example of fanaticism.

01:23:17.295 --> 01:23:29.187
And what – I’m happy that Americans had a little experience of these fanatics. All fanatics catch all these people.

01:23:29.295 --> 01:23:36.187
These so-called Lutherans, and the so-called Pentecostal, they are nothing but they are all possessed people –

01:23:36.295 --> 01:23:40.187
specially the Pentecostals are possessed, can’t you see them?

01:23:40.295 --> 01:23:43.187
They are recluses, they are useless people, they are wasting themselves.

01:23:43.295 --> 01:23:51.187
All the spiritualists and all these people – they could be right-sided or left-sided.

01:23:51.295 --> 01:23:59.187
LSD takes you to the right side, because you start seeing the lights and all those hallucinations which are of the supra-conscious.

01:23:59.295 --> 01:24:06.187
Left-sided people who are there, they get into – they are all the time crying, weeping,

01:24:06.295 --> 01:24:12.187
diffident, sly type, intriguers, they are on the left hand side.

01:24:12.295 --> 01:24:15.187
But if you move too much on this side then you can also get possessed.

01:24:15.295 --> 01:24:21.187
You can get very badly possessed and this one, this movement is very painful.

01:24:21.295 --> 01:24:24.187
Is painful to the person. Because they aggress on the person.

01:24:24.295 --> 01:24:32.187
But if you have this kind, this type of movement on the right hand side, then you aggress others.

01:24:32.295 --> 01:24:36.187
Because this is done with the ego and this is done with the superego.

01:24:36.295 --> 01:24:48.187
So the person who has a left side problem is better in the society because he troubles himself, and he needs his own cure, and he is not a problem.

01:24:48.295 --> 01:24:55.187
But a person who is a egoist is such a problem that he doesn’t see, he doesn’t feel the pain of others and he gives pain to others.

01:24:55.295 --> 01:25:01.187
He talks in such a way that he hurts, and he has a very bad right Vishuddhi,

01:25:01.295 --> 01:25:07.187
and everything he does, all aggressiveness, all war and all these things are a right-sided man.

01:25:07.295 --> 01:25:14.187
And such a man can become very successful like Hitler, but ultimately he meets his doom

01:25:14.295 --> 01:25:22.187
and nobody respects such a person ultimately. See, everything afterwards in history tells about the dirty things he was doing,

01:25:22.295 --> 01:25:27.187
the sly things he was doing, or the bad things he was doing, how many he has killed,

01:25:27.295 --> 01:25:34.187
what he did – everything comes out in history and he is just put into the light of history,

01:25:34.295 --> 01:25:38.187
and you start seeing that this man, who was supposed to be so successful,

01:25:38.295 --> 01:25:43.187
“Oh, God, we do not want to know him”. One of the sahaja yogis came to Me,

01:25:43.295 --> 01:25:49.187
he told Me – he’s a French – he said, “Mother, please tell me if I was Napoleon. If I was don’t tell me,

01:25:49.295 --> 01:25:57.187
because then I will die”. I said, “Why?”. He said, “I feel that I’m very egoistical, after Realization

01:25:57.295 --> 01:26:04.187
I find my ego is like this and I topple like that, and I can draw very well, and he used to draw.

01:26:04.295 --> 01:26:09.187
So if I was Napoleon don’t tell me, if I was don’t tell me, I will really commit suicide”.

01:26:09.295 --> 01:26:14.187
And in French, in French people if you call somebody a Napoleon, it’s a, it’s an abuse,

01:26:14.295 --> 01:26:20.187
you can imagine, Napoleon the great is being used as an abuse.

01:26:20.295 --> 01:26:25.187
So this is the thing that one has to understand, that ego-oriented person is over-disciplined,

01:26:25.295 --> 01:26:33.187
may be military-like, he may not drink, smoke, you see, he may walk straight like a stick. But he is old.

01:26:33.295 --> 01:26:39.187
The other one might be indulging into all such things and he might be drinking too much,

01:26:39.295 --> 01:26:44.187
and all the drunkards you find are on the left hand side. Poor things they start with a small thing.

01:26:44.295 --> 01:26:49.187
When they start it with a small thing they are driven onto this extreme, then they get caught up.

01:26:49.295 --> 01:26:55.187
Alcoholics are really, not that they drink, there’s some spirit in them that drinks.

01:26:55.295 --> 01:27:02.187
I met last time a lady from Cuba, she was a petite woman, small, thin woman, and her husband came

01:27:02.295 --> 01:27:08.187
and told Me that she can take one whisky bottle neat! I said: “This little woman, how does she do it?!”.

01:27:08.295 --> 01:27:13.187
He said: “She does!”. And I asked her and she said: “Yes, Mother, I do”.

01:27:13.295 --> 01:27:17.187
I put her a bandhan and I found a horrible big personality in her.

01:27:17.295 --> 01:27:22.187
Horrible, tall, very hefty person. He said, “Mother, did you see that one?”.

01:27:22.295 --> 01:27:27.187
I said: “Yes, I did”. She said, “It is he who drinks, and I’m blamed”. She could see him also.

01:27:27.295 --> 01:27:33.187
Such people who are on the left side can see the spirits and the things walking in,

01:27:33.295 --> 01:27:39.187
and they get all kinds of ESP experiences, and “I get a hunch” and all sorts of things – is little movement that side.

01:27:39.295 --> 01:27:44.187
And the right-sided people also can have such hunches as to what to do tomorrow,

01:27:44.295 --> 01:27:49.187
and how to do it, and what will happen, they get all kinds of hunches.

01:27:49.295 --> 01:27:56.187
There are people who are getting photographs of the people, such people – one gentleman showed Me some photographs

01:27:56.295 --> 01:28:06.187
which in an organization in (…). It’s a lady, she showed Me it’s taking out the photographs of all the horrible kings of England.

01:28:06.295 --> 01:28:13.187
As if they were dead, with their faces… it was surprising! It was surprising.

01:28:13.295 --> 01:28:18.187
And now thank God that organization is not getting any information, but it was a horrible thing, and

01:28:18.295 --> 01:28:24.187
if you keep these photographs in your house you also get bad vibrations, you might get their spirits coming into you.

01:28:24.295 --> 01:28:30.187
In BBC the other day we saw a film where a man was possessed by a spirit of Van Gogh.

01:28:30.295 --> 01:28:37.187
I hope you know him, Van Gogh is the painter who paints in one line many colors like that, you see?

01:28:37.295 --> 01:28:42.187
And this fellow was doing – actually I mean, we saw that with our own eyes – was painting just like Van Gogh.

01:28:42.295 --> 01:28:46.187
And he said that, “Van Gogh is doing this to me”.

01:28:46.295 --> 01:28:51.187
So all such things happen when you are on the left side – could be on the right side,

01:28:51.295 --> 01:28:57.187
for some artist may be on the right side. But this you can only find out with vibrations, which side you are possessed.

01:28:57.295 --> 01:29:03.187
Now I’ve told you why we have to have dharma, why we have to have Ten Commandments,

01:29:03.295 --> 01:29:08.187
why we should be in our sustenance, so that we keep to the middle path of Sushumna,

01:29:08.295 --> 01:29:17.187
this center path of our evolution, and not to deviate too much to this side and not to deviate too much to that side.

01:29:17.295 --> 01:29:24.187
That’s the reason we had to have religions. But all religions have become fanatics. They are fanatics.

01:29:24.295 --> 01:29:27.187
So they are good for nothing, useless people.

01:29:27.295 --> 01:29:33.187
Absolutely on the contrary they have created so many sects and so many fightings that one can’t understand.

01:29:33.295 --> 01:29:39.187
Now, these great Incarnations have come on this earth, they all have come as one aspect.

01:29:39.295 --> 01:29:44.187
Christ has said “Those who are not against Me – with Me”.Who are those who are not against Him?

01:29:44.295 --> 01:29:52.187
See, you didn’t even allow Him to talk! He had to fight for every-day life!

01:29:52.295 --> 01:29:56.187
Same thing you did to Mohammed Sahib, the same thing you did to all the saints who came on this earth.

01:29:56.295 --> 01:30:00.187
It’s not only Christ, you see the life of Socrates.

01:30:00.295 --> 01:30:08.187
You see the life of everyone who was like this, we had Sai Nath in India, was only hundred years back he must have died, only hundred years back.

01:30:08.295 --> 01:30:12.187
But if you see His life was a struggle! Nobody would listen to Him.

01:30:12.295 --> 01:30:20.187
At least there are some people here to listen to Me, but Sai Nath had about three or four disciples, that’s all.

01:30:20.295 --> 01:30:26.187
That is the sign that I must be a true Teacher, because if you have too much that means you are all mesmerized,

01:30:26.295 --> 01:30:35.187
and thousands, fifty-thousand people are sitting there and somebody is throwing a red colour through a cannon and they are “ah!”, like mad.

01:30:35.295 --> 01:30:42.187
Is this God’s Realization? Is this spirituality? You are not to be mad people.

01:30:42.295 --> 01:30:48.187
You have to be aware, and specially alert. You become really aware,

01:30:48.295 --> 01:30:52.187
which is enlightened, your awareness has to be enlightened, you have to become that.

01:30:52.295 --> 01:30:56.187
Not to be like sheep, go there into any place, taken away anywhere – no, not that.

01:30:56.295 --> 01:31:02.187
So we have to awaken ourselves. We have to brighten ourselves and understand our responsibility.

01:31:02.295 --> 01:31:08.187
And we have to know that we are saints, we have come here to become our Spirits,

01:31:08.295 --> 01:31:13.187
and the responsibility is very much great on the people of America.

01:31:13.295 --> 01:31:20.187
American saints have the greatest responsibility, though Sahaja Yoga has prospered so much in Australia. Most surprising.

01:31:20.295 --> 01:31:25.187
You condemned them as criminals, they went down there, they had children, grand-children,

01:31:25.295 --> 01:31:34.187
and they have much less ego, much more wisdom, and that is the center of Mooladhara.

01:31:34.295 --> 01:31:41.187
That is the first center. Australia is the first center. And people are so wise, you won’t believe.

01:31:41.295 --> 01:31:47.187
I mean, there was not even a single seat left when I went there, and thousands of people,

01:31:47.295 --> 01:31:51.187
the media was so sensible and so wise, and – I mean, there are seven cities

01:31:51.295 --> 01:31:58.187
and all the seven cities have got centers in Sahaja Yoga. Just like villagers in India; they are so wise.

01:31:58.295 --> 01:32:02.187
As villagers in India are wise, they are that wise. And I don’t know what to say:

01:32:02.295 --> 01:32:06.187
the persons who are supposed to be the complete wisdom here at this point, to be the witness,

01:32:06.295 --> 01:32:12.187
to be the sixteens – can you see here [points at Vishuddhi on chakra chart – ed], sub-sixteen, and I’ll talk about it next time,

01:32:12.295 --> 01:32:18.187
because I’ve told you about this center of Rama and then I’ll tell you about all these centers tomorrow, and above also.

01:32:18.295 --> 01:32:19.187
Thank you very much. May God bless you.

01:32:20.295 --> 01:32:33.187
Now, if you have any questions, you ask Me. Warren: Do you have any questions?

01:32:33.295 --> 01:32:47.187
Shri Mataji: Now. It’s alright. Now can I take out these fixations?. See now. Bugging, you see?

01:32:47.295 --> 01:32:55.187
Warren: Yes. American special. “I’m learning some words!

01:32:55.295 --> 01:32:58.187
Now address the questions to Me”. Warren says to somebody: “Yes. Just stand up and speak up”. A seeker asks a question).

01:32:58.295 --> 01:33:03.187
Seeker: Why do some people lean more to the left side and others to the right side?

01:33:03.295 --> 01:33:08.187
Shri Mataji: What’s it? Warren repeats: Why do some lean more to the left side and others lean more to the right side?

01:33:08.295 --> 01:33:12.187
Seeker: And some even in the center? Warren repeats: And some in the center?

01:33:12.295 --> 01:33:16.187
Seeker: Is there a karmic patent or…? Warren: Is there a karmic patent, he says?

01:33:16.295 --> 01:33:21.187
Shri Mataji: There is, you see, we are made of three gunas.

01:33:21.295 --> 01:33:25.187
And the permutations and combinations are there of these three gunas. Alright?

01:33:25.295 --> 01:33:35.187
And those who are tamo gunis, more desires they have, the more sort of emotional they are, they are on the left side.

01:33:35.295 --> 01:33:41.187
Those who are ambitious, are on the right side. And those who are wiser are in the center.

01:33:41.295 --> 01:33:46.187
So it’s a temperament with which you are born. It has many reasons. It’s the background,

01:33:46.295 --> 01:33:55.187
it’s the things you have come out of it, and what was your education, how were your parents – I mean,

01:33:55.295 --> 01:34:02.187
so many things work it out, the personality. And these three gunas, tamo, rajo and sattwa gunas,

01:34:02.295 --> 01:34:08.187
these three qualities within us, work out permutations and combinations of all the people.

01:34:08.295 --> 01:34:16.187
And that’s how we have different type of people. And according to their style they move to one side or another.

01:34:16.295 --> 01:34:30.187
Alright? I will be talking about that also maybe if I have time, about tamo guna, rajo guna and sattwa guna.

01:34:30.295 --> 01:34:40.187
(Lady seeker asks a question …“by balancing out of the sides”…) Shri Mataji: What’s she saying?

01:34:40.295 --> 01:34:46.187
Warren repeats: Can you help people who are mentally sick, by balancing these two sides?

01:34:46.295 --> 01:34:52.187
Shri Mataji: Of course! I have helped. And you have to help them.

01:34:52.295 --> 01:34:57.187
Lady seeker: Yes. I’m schizophrenic, that’s why I’m asking. Warren: Schizophrenia?

01:34:57.295 --> 01:35:05.187
Shri Mataji: Of course. No doubt. But I hope the Americans won’t put Me in jail for saving these people!

01:35:05.295 --> 01:35:14.187
My husband told Me, “Don’t touch anyone otherwise you’ll be in jail”. Of course I can. No doubt.

01:35:14.295 --> 01:35:21.187
Lady seeker: Could I learn it? Shri Mataji: What’s it? Warren: Can she learn? Lady seeker: Could I learn? Warren: Can she learn it?

01:35:21.295 --> 01:35:30.187
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, why not? You can. But first of all you get well. You have to be much stronger.

01:35:30.295 --> 01:35:35.187
You must learn all the ways and methods. Then you can of course, why not? Even My photograph does that.

01:35:35.295 --> 01:35:43.187
See, you don’t have to worry, you can use My photograph. If they don’t arrest Me for the photograph, it’s alright.

01:35:43.295 --> 01:35:49.187
They told Me you have to be a lawyer in this country to exist, I don’t know what (is that? – Barely audible) (laughter).

01:35:53.295 --> 01:35:56.187
Warren: Yes? Shri Mataji: Yes? Seeker: Did She have a teacher?

01:35:56.295 --> 01:36:02.187
Warren repeats: Did You have a teacher?

01:36:02.295 --> 01:36:16.187
Shri Mataji: No. Seeker: No? (Somebody is heard muttering something like: “You hadn’t any teacher…” and goes on muttering)

01:36:16.295 --> 01:36:20.187
Warren: Any other questions?

01:36:20.295 --> 01:36:28.187
Shri Mataji: I’m born like this. I’m ancient. Antique. (laughter, She laughs) (The man from the public continues muttering)

01:36:28.295 --> 01:36:33.187
Warren: Do you mind not disturbing please.

01:36:33.295 --> 01:36:38.187
Shri Mataji: Loudly. Whatever you say, say it loudly.

01:36:38.295 --> 01:36:42.187
Warren: Please, don’t disturb. If you’ve got a question specifically ask it, but don’t disturb.

01:36:42.295 --> 01:36:45.187
Shri Mataji: What did he say? Warren: He is just mumbling.

01:36:45.295 --> 01:36:55.187
Shri Mataji: No, no, no. You say it loudly, what did you say? (The person keeps talking lowly) Warren: No, no, he’s…Shri Mataji: What? Why? Yogi: He is a drunk.

01:36:55.295 --> 01:37:01.187
Warren: He is drunk, Mother. Shri Mataji: Is he?

01:37:01.295 --> 01:37:05.187
Warren: Hm. Any other questions? Yes.

01:37:05.295 --> 01:37:09.187
A seeker: When everybody leaves, will we be able to continue in New York?

01:37:09.295 --> 01:37:14.187
Warren repeats: When You leave, will they still be able to continue in New York and can learn how to grow?

01:37:14.295 --> 01:37:21.187
Shri Mataji: Yes. You see, we have got somebody – Hermann has not come today, I don’t know – where is he gone, Hermann? (Warren: “He is working today”)

01:37:21.295 --> 01:37:29.187
He is working today. And he has offered his place for working Sahaja Yoga. We – actually, you see,

01:37:29.295 --> 01:37:37.187
we have imported people from London, who do not have houses here, and also he is from Australia.

01:37:37.295 --> 01:37:43.187
But Hermann said that he can offer his residence for the use of Sahaja Yoga to begin with, you see,

01:37:43.295 --> 01:37:48.187
because we don’t take any money, and you have to organize it yourself.

01:37:48.295 --> 01:37:55.187
And we have got here Christine, who is a very old Sahaja Yogini, and she can work it out.

01:37:55.295 --> 01:38:00.187
We have some other people also, who may be coming and going from Philadelphia,

01:38:00.295 --> 01:38:10.187
and you people could be here – I’ll also come back again if you call Me. Next year maybe. We all can go to India also.

01:38:10.295 --> 01:38:18.187
We are going to go to India…when? (Warren: “In…” Shri Mataji: “Eh?” Warren: “… December”) December.

01:38:18.295 --> 01:38:24.187
If you people want to come to India, we can take you down to India also, in December;

01:38:24.295 --> 01:38:30.187
and we will have a program of about – how many days? Warren: About forty-five – fifty days.

01:38:30.295 --> 01:38:33.187
Shri Mataji: About of forty-five – fifty days, we’ll be passing through villages and all that,

01:38:33.295 --> 01:38:40.187
and that’s you mix up with other people, and learn about Sahaj Yog, is a very good way of learning about Sahaj Yog, you see,

01:38:40.295 --> 01:38:46.187
where you learn how to give Realization, and imbibe things, and it’s very good way.

01:38:46.295 --> 01:38:54.187
If you want you can come along and it is going to be quite cheap for you, only you have to pay for your food and for your travelling,

01:38:54.295 --> 01:39:00.187
that’s all, and food will be very cheaply arranged; and very good food, we can arrange that.

01:39:00.295 --> 01:39:07.187
And this time – last time they paid three pounds per day, this time they are going to pay four pounds per day.

01:39:07.295 --> 01:39:16.187
And everything can be done, we’ll go to different villages, and stay there and organize it.

01:39:16.295 --> 01:39:26.187
It’s not going to be any money-making proposition or anything, it’s a thing by which you go into simpler places and learn about Sahaj Yog.

01:39:26.295 --> 01:39:36.187
It’s better, because here, you see, it’s very quiet in this place, I feel, but otherwise in New York you have such a horrible, this signaling business, you know?

01:39:36.295 --> 01:39:45.187
And all the sounds – and the atmosphere is so much filled with funny sounds all over, and it’s horrifying.

01:39:45.295 --> 01:39:50.187
Warren: Mother, a lot of people have asked about the practices, how they learn the practices for Sahaja Yoga,

01:39:50.295 --> 01:39:58.187
the various things they can do, that they have to do. And I think they should all know that you just come along to the group,

01:39:58.295 --> 01:40:04.187
after Mother’s gone, and you’ll learn all these things. I too wanted to know how to do it,

01:40:04.295 --> 01:40:08.187
as soon as I got my realization. Sometimes you are a little too keen to know…

01:40:08.295 --> 01:40:11.187
Shri Mataji: But you can tell them how to give first of all protection to your aura.

01:40:11.295 --> 01:40:17.187
This gentleman told Me that his aura was – did get disturbed, it’s true, your aura gets disturbed.

01:40:17.295 --> 01:40:23.187
So you get first of all a method of first of all protecting your auras.

01:40:23.295 --> 01:40:33.187
And how to raise your Kundalini. This method I will teach you today. Alright? After realization. What else?

01:40:33.295 --> 01:40:46.187
Warren: Yes. (A seeker asks one question: “When She talked of saving the creation… (Indistinct) Does She mean that the creation is lost?”)

01:40:46.295 --> 01:40:52.187
Warren: The creation? (Seeker: “She said of saving the creation”.) Yes, I heard the first part. Does She mean…

01:40:52.295 --> 01:41:01.187
(Seeker: “That the creation is lost, or…”- indistinct) (Warren repeats to Shri Mataji:) You spoke of saving the creation. He is asking, do You consider that the creation is lost?

01:41:01.295 --> 01:41:12.187
Shri Mataji: May be, may be lost. It’s not yet lost but may be lost. You see, creation, the epitome of creation is you, is the human beings.

01:41:12.295 --> 01:41:21.187
Alright? If you are not saved, the creation is lost. You are to be saved. And God has to save it, it is His own creation.

01:41:21.295 --> 01:41:32.187
You are His creation. And He has to save it. (To Warren:) I mean, how did a drunkard come in?

01:41:32.295 --> 01:41:38.187
Warren (to a seeker): Yes. (A seeker asks a question) Warren: Say again.

01:41:38.295 --> 01:41:46.187
Seeker: Does She consider the creation something apart from God? Or is the creation also God or what is it?

01:41:46.295 --> 01:41:52.187
(Warren repeats:) Do You consider the creation something apart from God? Or is it also God or what is it?

01:41:52.295 --> 01:41:57.187
Shri Mataji (laughing): Accha, now, you see, this is a subject which I have to deal with, alright?

01:41:57.295 --> 01:42:03.187
What is creation, what is God, how He created you, how we became human beings, it’s a big subject.

01:42:03.295 --> 01:42:10.187
And it’s to be handled sometime and you are to be told all about it. And I cannot just answer it in five minutes.

01:42:10.295 --> 01:42:14.187
But I will, it’s a good question and should come to you.

01:42:14.295 --> 01:42:20.187
But before knowing all these things and details about it, is better you get your light.

01:42:20.295 --> 01:42:25.187
Once you have your light, gradually you start understanding it. Alright?

01:42:25.295 --> 01:42:29.187
Warren: Yes? Seeker: What is the meaning of Sahaja Yoga?

01:42:29.295 --> 01:42:35.187
Shri Mataji: Sahaja. Saha means with – ja means born. Is born with you, spontaneous. Sahaja means spontaneous.

01:42:35.295 --> 01:42:43.187
Whatever is living is spontaneous. You see, whatever happens spontaneously – we don’t understand the word of spontaneous also.

01:42:43.295 --> 01:42:50.187
Means a living, living expression, living manifestation is spontaneous, Sahaja. Is born with you.

01:42:50.295 --> 01:42:56.187
But today Sahaja has gone into the stage called as Maha-Yoga. Means it has become a en-masse.

01:42:56.295 --> 01:43:05.187
It works en-masse. Before it used to work in one person, two persons, you see – like one flower becoming a fruit in the beginning of the tree.

01:43:05.295 --> 01:43:10.187
But today the situation is such that thousands can get realization. It’s Maha-Yoga.

01:43:10.295 --> 01:43:14.187
Sahaja Yoga has matured into Maha-Yoga. Maha means the great.

01:43:14.295 --> 01:43:20.187
(Aside to Warren): I hope he is back – I hope he doesn’t do something to Arneau. Warren: No, the caretaker is outside.
