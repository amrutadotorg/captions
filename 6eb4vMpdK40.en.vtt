00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:13.710
Sorry, I had to say something before entering in,

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.590
but it is good that it has happened,

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:21.270
because now I have to tell you some things important in life

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:26.070
and that is specially for ladies I have to tell this.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:30.750
I've noticed - of course, I am also a woman

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:37.430
that women have certain water powers of crying, weeping

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:41.750
and, thinking they're very miserable

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:45.830
and making everybody miserable. This is their power.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.030
I've noticed this. I mean this song is the worst song

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.430
you could sing on any day whatsoever,

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:55.750
but it has come into somebody's head,

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.670
is very negative and not only that,

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.510
but it shows a person who can never be happy

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:04.750
and doesn't want anybody to be happy.

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:10.670
So inside every woman, there is a motherhood,

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.270
there's great capacities,

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:17.590
sacrifice, everything is there.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:22.910
With that, they also should know they're left-sided.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:31.190
And our joy about which we talk

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:34.430
within our heart

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:38.830
has to manifest outside.

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:41.510
People should see that we are joyous,

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.990
that we are happy people,

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:49.270
that we are not like others who start crying for small things.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.990
Like when My father died,

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.670
I was surprised that suddenly I became thoughtless,

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:57.830
absolutely thoughtless.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:00.830
For about three days I was thoughtless.

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:02.750
Neither the thought of pain

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:06.270
or the thought of unhappiness or anything came up,

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:09.750
but just thoughtless.

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.110
And everybody was surprised

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:19.750
because I looked after him and, I mean, he was very attached to Me,

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.910
very fond of me, everything was there.

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:26.990
They were surprised how easily I became suddenly thoughtless.

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:29.350
So if you are a Sahaja Yogini,

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:31.350
then at the time of crisis

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:33.830
you should become thoughtless. That's one of the signs.

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:37.190
I have seen with Myself, if there is any crisis in the family,

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:40.750
I just become thoughtless. That means what?

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:46.270
That God just takes you in your problems.

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:50.910
He puts his hand, He puts His protection

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:54.190
and He takes you out of it

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:56.990
and makes you absolutely thoughtless.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:59.990
And in that thoughtless

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:07.830
awareness you discover what is right, what is wrong.

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:10.910
So even in crisis,

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.750
this thoughtless awareness

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.350
is all the time extremely alert.

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:20.190
It becomes much more alert than normal.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:24.670
That's the sign of a Sahaja Yogi and sign of Sahaja Yogini.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:26.750
But I’ve noticed it, very surprisingly,

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:29.270
specially with French, Indian girls, who came here.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:33.070
I was shocked that they were very left-sided,

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:35.310
crying type, nonsensical

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:37.630
and to hear this song again I was surprised,

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:40.150
“How could they sing such a song from France?”

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.830
As it is, France, you know, the problem is

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:46.750
they drink such a lot.

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:50.070
I’m sorry today the French have done this beautiful thing,

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:51.750
but I better tell.

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:53.830
Now when they drink, they think they are very happy,

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:55.110
they’re very joyous,

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:58.310
but you know how long it lasts? It just finishes off

00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:59.990
and they suffer.

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:03.710
But as a result of drinking, they become very left-sided

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:07.550
and if you see a Frenchman, he’s always unhappy.

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:09.950
Even to say that he’s happy,

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:15.510
he feels shy because people will think he is ignoramus.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:19.710
So he should be a miserable person "Les Misérables".

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:23.350
If he’s not, then he’s not French.

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:33.150
We are not. We are in the Kingdom of God.

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.630
In no way we are unhappy, in no way.

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:40.870
Some things happen in life after all.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:43.550
Life is such. Somebody has to die.

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:46.630
Everybody doesn’t die together. Imagine everybody dies.

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:50.590
What will happen to people? Who will bury us?

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:56.230
I mean, think of if you are all born together,

00:12:56.390 --> 00:13:00.110
who’ll deliver us?

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:03.590
So everybody who is born has to die,

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:07.390
but the way they have made the death as some sort of

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:15.350
a big part of life. It’s just a moment,

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:20.270
just a moment that you pass out

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:25.510
and you go and change and come back again.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:29.870
But in this life, if you have to do anything, is to enjoy.

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:31.950
So, for that, their philosophy is

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:34.230
that you should go to pubs

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.590
because, God knows, when we die what will happen.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:39.270
So they use it in the other way.

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:43.350
This is English. I’m not saying the French.

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:53.110
But in India, when somebody die,

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:57.950
they get bands and all kinds of music

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:02.710
and they go on playing in front of the dead body.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.230
And why they play?

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:11.710
Because if there are bhoots or anything, they will all run away.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:18.350
Also that you should not feel sad.

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:25.230
Accept what God has done for you is for your good.

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:30.470
And then they have a big dinner,

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.030
one day after tenth or thirteenth day,

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:37.270
very big dinner has to be given.

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:40.070
It’s very surprising, you know,

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:43.870
that country which is so poor, such a problem.

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:47.790
If the father dies, then the whole family becomes like an orphan,

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:50.350
orphanage.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:53.590
Despite all that,

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:57.270
they don’t wear any black dress,

00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:02.310
otherwise I have seen here people wearing black dresses.

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:04.830
And a lady was very upset.

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:06.870
She said, “The bank will open at ten o’clock

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:08.950
and I have to go to the funeral

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:13.110
and my ornaments are in the bank.”

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:16.550
But I said, “But ornaments you don’t wear for a funeral, do you?”

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:17.950
“No, no, I have my special ones.

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:21.910
You know, I have got very nice dark, black ones.”

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:28.430
I said – and the best part of it, the day they die

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:31.630
they must have champagne.

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:35.030
When the person dies: champagne.

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:39.870
When they come back home, they must have lunch and a big party.

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:43.390
So it’s such a contradictory life

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:47.110
that we have been because in Christian religion

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:50.430
they have not said much about the death.

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:52.510
I mean, Christ, if they had allowed Him to live,

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:54.670
He would have talked about it.

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:57.910
But He has said that Spirit is eternal.

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:01.110
He has talked of reincarnation, no doubt,

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:04.630
but these people didn’t tell about this.

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:10.110
So death means now that that man is lost forever

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:13.190
or this life is lost forever.

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:17.230
Then we hang in the limbo or we hang somewhere else.

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:18.830
We never come back.

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:22.750
This is absolutely wrong. It’s not so.

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:26.430
So what you have to achieve in this lifetime,

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:29.790
the highest thing is your ascent

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:35.710
and your position in the Kingdom of God.

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:38.830
For, especially for ladies, I have to tell you

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:42.590
because, you see, reading all these tragic things all over,

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:45.270
so many tragedies are brought up,

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:49.590
this Greek tragedy, this tragedy, that tragedy.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:56.190
It just starts working in the nerves of the ladies.

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:58.950
If somebody says the slightest thing,

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:00.750
it becomes like a bombshell.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:03.110
They just start behaving as if

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:07.670
“Oh, my God, what has happened?

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:11.030
He should not have said this to me.”

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:17.750
But what we do to ourselves, we should see first.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:23.430
What harm we do to ourselves, we never cry for that.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:27.350
You have seen how in the West women have ruined themselves.

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:30.350
They never cry for that, never, never.

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:34.350
But they cry if somebody says even a little word to them.

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:37.190
Of course, in India also.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.870
But there are very sensible women,

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.550
otherwise, I have seen in the East and West

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:46.990
who have a great sense of bearing,

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:50.750
a majestic attitude towards life.

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:52.830
Like an elephant is walking

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:57.070
and the dogs are barking, so what does it matter?

00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:01.430
That majesty comes when inside you have that joy.

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:04.550
“Nobody can make me unhappy.”

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:07.350
This is – should be the principle.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:09.790
“Nothing can make me unhappy.”

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:12.790
Otherwise, you start moving towards the left side.

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:16.350
When a lady starts crying and a man starts going to the left

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:20.110
and suddenly you find ten bhoots sitting on him.

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:24.630
How does he get it? “I’ve never been to a cemetery.

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:27.110
I’ve never been to any such place, Mother.

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:29.270
I never saw anybody dying.”

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:31.590
“Then how did you get bhootish?”

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:34.430
“I never went to any guru.”

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:36.270
See the wife.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:39.590
Wife is a crying doll.

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:42.590
For everything she cries.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:45.510
If you don’t do this, cry.

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:50.710
This is another kind of ego expression, I tell you

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:52.190
this crying business.

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:54.750
So today I want to have a promise from all of you

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:58.830
that you are not going to cry at all.

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:02.670
Instead of flowers, you just give me this flower

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:04.350
of promise.

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:09.990
I never cry. Of course, sometimes Sandra karuna,

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:13.430
one tear or two tears might come out of My

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:16.470
– after all, I’m a mother.

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:21.510
But not like this – sitting, crying, crying, becoming hysterics.

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:25.030
You must have your dignity. You are all Sahaja Yoginis.

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:29.390
Don’t read any book which talks of crying,

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:35.750
but books which are deep

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:38.630
also make you feel very much touched.

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:41.710
You feel like crying, it’s all right.

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:46.190
In the cinema they see a woman torturing her husband,

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:47.750
then they will cry.

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:52.350
At home they’ll come and torture the husband. What’s the use?

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:55.670
I’ve seen many like that.

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:58.590
In the cinema they’ll be crying.

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:01.230
When it is somebody else, they feel the pain.

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:04.430
When it is themselves, they never see what they are doing.

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:11.430
So My one demand today is that

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:13.830
you must not cry.

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:17.190
Now you are in the Kingdom of God

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:21.990
and in the Kingdom of God you do not cry.

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:24.950
Now we had All Saints Day. We had this, that.

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:27.870
They used to do all in India also they have nonsense like that.

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:31.030
All right, give them their due,

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:36.670
but you don’t celebrate by crying.

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:41.110
That is one sign that you are really joyous.

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:44.710
I mean, what a song to hear and I was shocked.

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:48.910
Who suggested the song? Can I ask the culprit?

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:57.470
I know that must have been an Indian woman. Has to be.

00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:03.190
[Speaks in Hindi.]

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:16.830
So look at these beautiful things that they have created.

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:19.030
If there was no beauty within themselves,

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:22.790
they would have been sitting and crying.

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:25.710
What else? Of course,

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:30.150
those people are beautiful – they never cry.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:33.830
Maybe crocodile tears sometimes, just to show off,

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:36.950
but inside they don’t cry

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:39.670
because they’re so confident.

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:42.950
They enjoy their beauty. They enjoy their glory.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:47.830
They enjoy themselves. Why should they cry? What is the need?

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:52.150
And such wasted tears are of no use.

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:58.750
So it is today we are here to enjoy our joy,

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:02.270
our Atmananda, Nirananda and Paramananda.

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:05.990
All these we are here to enjoy,

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:09.630
which are of eternal value.

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:12.870
You have to understand that

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:17.590
now believe that you are in the Kingdom of God

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:22.430
and all the subtle beauties of your being

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:24.670
are going to be opened out to you.

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:27.110
You are going to see yourself all the beauty.

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:29.710
But here, if your eyes are already closed,

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:31.510
if your heart is already closed

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:34.510
and you don’t want to see something that’s so beautiful,

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:39.270
how can I say what a beautiful thing they have made?

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:44.350
Is a very important thing in life,

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:49.750
is to have a very positive attitude.

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:52.350
For Sahaja Yoga also.

00:22:53.630 --> 00:23:00.750
In Sahaja Yoga we have to develop ourselves within.

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:03.630
But that’s not so. People will say,

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:05.630
“My mother is sick, my father is sick,

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:10.430
my brother is sick, my this thing, that one is sick.”

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:12.670
First, first thing is this.

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:15.790
I mean, sometimes I used to think that I’ll have to

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:20.070
just start a hospital instead of an ashram.

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:25.350
Then the second is “My husband is like this.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:29.830
My children are like this. My this thing is like that.”

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:34.190
This “my my my” is not you.

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:36.550
What are you?

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:39.830
You are a Sahaja Yogini

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:48.150
and in Sahaj you have to know that you have all the proofs,

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:54.110
everything before you to know that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:59.270
Now if I know that I am Adi Shakti, supposing,

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:09.310
if I know I am Adi Shakti, then I know,

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:13.750
then I don’t have to ask any help from anybody.

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:18.750
After all, I am Adi Shakti. I am supposed to do everything.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:27.470
That’s My job because I have that power

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:31.910
and I have that power, just sahaj,

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:37.430
I have that power with Me. So I have to do it.

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:41.270
Now, I can also say I’m a woman. I should sit down and cry.

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:46.150
No, I have no right. I cannot do it, even if I want to.

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:51.390
My job is to encourage you to tell you

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:54.830
about your inner subtleties, your beauty.

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:59.070
Now do you know what beautiful thing you are?

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:03.350
Let us talk about our inner beauty.

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:07.750
What are we?

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:12.750
Are we all these mad people?

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:19.310
Are we all these people who are all the time are miserable?

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:23.750
Or are we all these people who are always fighting,

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:26.950
those who are hankering after things,

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:32.790
whom this matter dominates?

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:39.630
No, we are the Spirit.

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:45.310
We are the Spirit. We are the reflection of God Almighty,

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:48.790
which is Purity,

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:52.310
which is Truth, which is Knowledge.

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:54.350
We are that.

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:58.030
We are not like ordinary people.

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:02.230
How can we live on that level?

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:05.390
Only if you are possessed, if you had a bad guru

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:08.430
or something like that, maybe you are going like a yo-yo,

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:11.510
going up and down, up and down, up and down,

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:14.270
but those who have crossed all those limits

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:20.310
have reached that state, should value that they are the Spirit

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:24.990
so many Spirits sitting here, sitting, reflecting God Almighty.

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:28.270
I am such a proud mother

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:30.910
and all of you are capable of enlightening

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:33.710
so many people in this world.

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:38.030
But the beauty within you is that you are

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:43.470
absolutely independent of anybody else.

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:49.550
You depend only upon yourself,

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:52.910
upon the source of your Spirit,

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:55.190
the joy of your Spirit.

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:58.790
You don't expect others to give you joy.

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:02.470
Supposing somebody tomorrow comes and abuses Me.

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:05.230
I'll say, "All right. It doesn't matter."

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:08.110
It never touches Me

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:11.550
because I am with Myself.

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:14.150
He is saying these things.

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:18.590
He will suffer or not suffer. That's not My department.

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:22.590
When you start depending only upon yourself,

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:27.470
just imagine a house

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:30.630
which is standing on rocks.

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:35.310
Like that, you are.

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:41.590
Try to feel it. Feel the rock within you.

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:46.270
Try to understand.

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:50.110
You are not going to behave like other people.

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:53.310
It's all right, people who have built their houses on sands

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:58.190
have to worry, not we. We have built on rocks.

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:02.990
So we have to be very courageous.

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:05.230
You have to be very bold.

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:08.910
At the same time, extremely humble.

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:13.710
When the tree is laden with fruits it bends down.

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:15.830
So we worship the Mother Earth.

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:18.350
We worship the sun. We worship the moon.

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:21.590
We  worship everything around us which has helped us.

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:24.910
We worship our parents, everyone.

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:29.750
But above all we worship ourselves.

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:35.230
Because we are worshipable.

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:37.630
Now all of you have become saints.

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:40.950
That doesn't mean that you develop beards and

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:44.230
have all funny dresses and all that. Nothing of the kind.

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:46.990
You are saints because inside you

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:54.230
there is the fragrance of beautiful fragrance

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:56.110
of your lotus.

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:59.070
That's the Spirit.

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:01.750
This is a lotus you have made for Me here.

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:06.750
Such a beautiful lotus, I am sitting in a beautiful lotus.

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:12.070
In the same way is reflected in your heart as a beautiful lotus.

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:15.270
Feel that lotus,

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:18.750
how beautiful, how delicate it is.

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:25.670
It's pink because pink is the lotus which

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:31.150
invites everyone,

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:37.070
sign of generosity, of invitation.

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:43.070
Pink colour attracts all kinds of insects, everybody.

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:52.070
So lotus is pink

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:56.830
and it invites everything,

00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:00.990
open to everything, not frightened of anything.

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:04.990
But it comes out of the mire,

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:10.550
comes out of absolutely horrible ponds.

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:15.470
There are lots of worms going round it, all right,

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:23.230
but it emits the fragrance

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:27.110
and makes the whole pond so beautiful.

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:29.630
That's what you are.

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:34.750
Wherever you'll be, you can create that beauty.

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:38.470
You can flow that beauty.

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:45.190
You can make people see

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:48.590
what a Spiritual person is.

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:52.430
You are the reflector of Sahaja Yoga, not Me.

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:55.790
You have to reflect Sahaj Yoga.

00:30:56.310 --> 00:31:01.510
For such people are always in joy

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:07.750
and wisdom.

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:14.190
Shri Ganesha is the giver of wisdom

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:19.790
wisdom, how to behave at what time,

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:22.510
how to say at what time,

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:24.390
how far to go with everything.

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:26.270
It just should become innate,

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:29.030
Sahaj. You don't have to work it out, but should know.

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:31.950
"Now I am a Sahaja Yogini."

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:37.870
Every morning you should tell yourself, "I am a Sahaja Yogini.

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:40.590
So how far I should go?

00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:43.510
How should I behave?

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:46.230
What should be my attitude?"

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:52.350
All this can be very easily understood if

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:57.830
you develop this lotus of wisdom.

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:03.950
How does a lotus come out? There is a seed which sprouts.

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:08.830
That's how the wisdom - there is already the seed within you.

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:12.110
All of you have got and now it has started opening

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:14.030
because you are realised souls.

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:17.630
Allow your wisdom to take over.

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:22.670
So how do you do it?

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:26.670
There's one way, I would say.

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:30.150
"Supposing Mother had this problem, what She would have done?"

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:32.550
Very good idea.

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:41.110
"How She would have dealt with it?"

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:44.510
You may again say that we don't understand Mother's style.

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:49.070
She's full of tricks. Correct. I am.

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:56.790
But there's a very simple way of doing it.

00:32:57.390 --> 00:33:01.470
You can surrender it to My wisdom

00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:04.870
and the wisdom itself that is in you is active.

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:07.470
It will work.

00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:12.750
This point also you should understand.

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:16.590
Wisdom within you is active.

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:20.310
There was one gentleman working at the airport in London.

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:21.790
He's a Sahaja Yogi,

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:25.430
but he doesn't come to the collective. He has no time.

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:29.630
So somebody said something harsh to him.

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:31.750
He went home and he said that

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:36.790
"It's not good he said to me. After all, I'm a Sahaja Yogi."

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:39.470
And next day he heard

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:44.270
the fellow has fallen from his bike.

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:49.110
The gentleman might not have understood that because

00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:52.750
he said all these things, "That's why this has happened to me."

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:56.550
But he knew because Deities are with you.

00:33:56.750 --> 00:34:03.190
So in wisdom you understand that all the Deities are just with you

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:09.310
and whatever happens to you, they're before you.

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:14.470
Nobody can harm you. Nobody can touch you.

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:23.670
You are so protected. Lotuses are not protected.

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:28.910
You are so protected that anybody tries to harm you,

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:32.870
immediately there's protection.

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:36.630
Also your own protection is there, as I said,

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:40.670
that you jump into thoughtless awareness.

00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:45.870
We harm ourselves more than anybody else can sometimes.

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:50.870
One friend of mine I knew,

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:53.110
she was from very childhood she was like that,

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:56.070
always crying for everything.

00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:57.870
Always she used to cry

00:34:58.070 --> 00:35:01.190
for nothing at all because she was such a spoiled child

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:04.110
that she used to always cry.

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:07.790
Now, was surprised to see at a very young age she became blind.

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:10.350
I said, "How did you become so blind?"

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:14.150
She had to use a very thick glass and all that.

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:17.510
She said, "I used to cry so much, you remember."

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:19.550
I said, "That I remember,

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:22.990
but did you cry even after school?"

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:26.190
"Yes, I was always crying like this."

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:30.390
So it's a kind of a personality you develop

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:34.030
that "I'm like that, I just cry."

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:38.550
But why not develop a personality that, "I am always in joy?"

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:41.150
Anything I see, I feel joyous.

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:45.070
Anything I hear, I feel joy.

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:51.510
Then this lotus of your fragrance will improve

00:35:54.750 --> 00:36:01.550
and then activity of your wisdom will be

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:09.150
that you will take all that is very beautiful

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:12.550
easily.

00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:17.630
You'll get all that is very satisfying, very joyous.

00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:22.510
It's kind of an activity of this wisdom within you

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:28.110
which just leads you to people who are extremely nice,

00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:30.670
to situations which are very beautiful

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:34.990
where you discover nice things

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:51.550
or to such beautiful creations

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:55.350
that you would never expect to see.

00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:03.830
It's very, very important to understand that you tell Me,

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:06.510
"Mother, that this miracle happened, that miracle happened."

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:10.150
Is nothing, is your own wisdom,

00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:15.270
your own Spirit is working it out.

00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:18.390
You don't have to do anything.

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:21.630
Only thing you have to remember that you are a Sahaja Yogini

00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:26.070
and your character should be that of a Sahaja Yogini,

00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:31.150
that your ideas should be that of a Sahaja Yogini.

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:33.710
Same with Sahaja Yogis.

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:40.950
Sahaja Yogis, being men, they don't show much,

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:45.550
but there are certain other ways of showing his temper.

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:51.310
They get into tempers and sometimes the tempers are so much that

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:54.950
you just start looking, "What's the matter with the person?"

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:58.070
One side the tempers, another side the crying.

00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:02.190
I mean, in between, what remains? I don't know.

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:07.390
Both things are absolutely not needed.

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:10.830
You have to correct people, to say things.

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:13.710
Just now I had to say something. I've said it, finished.

00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:20.470
But it's not anger. It just - I have to act.

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:24.230
The difference is like this - I'm not involved with it.

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:28.750
Even if I cry, I'm not involved. I'm just crying.

00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:32.310
Even if I am angry, I am not really angry.

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:37.390
I am just trying to be angry in an acting.

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:41.350
That's what happens.

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:44.310
You do not get involved into it.

00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:46.950
But if you get involved into your anger,

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:50.510
then the joy is finished, completely finished.

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:56.230
Some people think also that

00:38:56.430 --> 00:39:00.270
if you are joyous you have to be very serious.

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:01.910
Not at all.

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:04.790
What is there to be serious? What is to be serious in this world?

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:07.390
Everything is stupidity.

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:10.510
I don't find anything serious in this world.

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:14.590
And I can't keep serious for more than three minutes.

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:18.510
Sometimes people take advantage of that, but what can I do?

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:19.710
That's My nature.

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:22.630
What's so serious? You don't have to create sun.

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:27.950
You don't have to create moon. You don't have to create Mother Earth.

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:32.310
What's so serious? What great jobs have you to do?

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:37.990
Everything is there for you. Just enjoy.

00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:40.710
What is there to be so serious?

00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:45.870
Some people, you know, try to impress also by their seriousness.

00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:51.510
Once I saw a lady standing, very seriously thinking.

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:53.830
I said, "What is the problem?"

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:57.430
"I don't know how to broom this thing, I don't have a broom."

00:39:57.630 --> 00:40:01.270
I said, "Such a big problem is there as if the heavens are falling.

00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:03.790
Doesn't matter today you don't do it.

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:07.430
You can do it tomorrow. What is so important?"

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:10.390
I mean if you don't have something, it's all right.

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:13.590
"No, no, no, I must do it. You see, I'm very house-proud."

00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:17.990
I said, "That's the main problem which is serious."

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:23.550
So because you suffer from some serious, stupid problems,

00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:27.590
that's why you become serious.

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:29.510
And, by becoming serious, if you think

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:32.270
your problems will be solved, they will not.

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:36.430
At the same time, I must tell you we should not be frivolous.

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:40.190
We should not be vulgar and not frivolous.

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:43.990
That's not - see these flowers.

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:47.110
Look at them. They are shaking with My vibrations.

00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:50.070
But look at them, in their own dignity.

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:53.670
They're going to die tomorrow. They are not bothered

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:57.990
as long as they are all right there in their own place,

00:40:58.190 --> 00:41:02.430
giving you pleasure and happiness, finished.

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:05.990
What is the use of a light?

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:10.110
Let us see, as a light, as we are. To give the light.

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:15.670
So, we are here to give joy, happiness to everyone,

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:18.790
to make everyone happy.

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:23.830
There are so many ways of making others happy.

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:27.070
And for that, we have to learn also.

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:30.950
So many things we have to learn, how to make others happy.

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:33.350
And then when you make them happy,

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:36.790
then you feel that joy within yourself.

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:40.310
"Oh, they're so happy." See their happiness,

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:43.710
then only this lotus opens out much more.

00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:49.630
Like a ripple moves and moves

00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:54.990
to the end of the shores

00:41:55.190 --> 00:42:00.110
and then from the shore it returns back.

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:05.830
In the same way, when your joy reaches the joy of others,

00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:12.110
then the ripples that come up make a beautiful pattern of your life.

00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:14.230
Just think of such situations

00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:17.510
where you did something good to others,

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:20.550
being very nice to others

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:23.950
and then you found the joy in that person

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:27.390
and how that joy came back to you.

00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:32.430
Think of that pattern that you felt so subtlety in your life,

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:33.750
how it is built in.

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:37.310
Whenever you think of that time or that moment

00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:44.070
or that area, whole picture comes to you

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:52.230
and you think, "What a time!"

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:55.950
But that time is eternally within you,

00:42:56.150 --> 00:43:01.790
all the time and that's why is Diwali so important.

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:05.110
You are all, as I said, you are My light.

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:09.750
And the light is there which is an eternal light.

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:11.990
These lights will be finished.

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:15.070
We'll have to light them every year. Not you people.

00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:21.390
You have eternal light and this light is going to spread Joy.

00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:23.750
What's the problem of this world?

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:26.470
The whole problem, you take it.

00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:29.070
There's no joy.

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:34.710
Simple as that, there's no joy.

00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:36.590
If they had joy

00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:38.950
they would not have done all these nonsensical things.

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:41.750
There's no Joy. When you have joy, you don't want to fight,

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:44.750
you don't want to do anything that is harmful.

00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:47.270
You don't want to say anything harsh to anyone,

00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:50.470
not only that but you do not want to have

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:54.150
something that will spoil this Mother Earth

00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:56.390
or which will bring ecological problem.

00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:58.310
No, you just don't want it,

00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:02.150
don't want to do anything because it harms others.

00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:09.190
People feel unhappy about it whether it is here, India, anywhere.

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:14.310
You just feel that "Why should I do such a thing

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:17.830
which is not so congenial to others?"

00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:21.990
I mean, it's not joy-giving.

00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:25.550
So when you have joy, you have to be joy-giving

00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:27.630
and if you are not joy-giving

00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:30.750
that means there's something lacking in your Sahaja Yoga

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:34.150
and that's why we have to come up now.

00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:39.350
We have to become Sahaja Yoginis and Sahaja Yogis.

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:43.190
That is joy-giving society.

00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:45.110
We can change our name, if you like.

00:44:45.310 --> 00:44:51.830
If Sahaja Yoga is not good - Joy Giving Association.

00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:12.230
Now also we should find out what kills the joy.

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:16.830
That's important. What kills the joy?

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:21.030
First I said you must have wisdom.

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:24.470
Wisdom means that it gives you detachment,

00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:31.270
detachment from all that is selfishness,

00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:35.950
self-centredness,

00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:41.910
self-obsession,

00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:43.790
ego

00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:48.150
all connected with self. Can you imagine?

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:54.790
Selfish, the Self, means the Spirit.

00:45:58.990 --> 00:46:02.510
Selfishness is what?

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:07.350
Is the one that completely darkens the Self

00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:12.470
because you think of yourself,

00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:15.870
your children, your family, that's all.

00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:21.230
At the most, even that sometimes - sometimes it's only yourself.

00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:27.910
And when you start thinking like that

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:30.830
and when you start

00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:36.430
becoming smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller,

00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:41.550
the lotus collapses.

00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:50.390
But to think about others is so great.

00:46:51.830 --> 00:46:54.510
In My case is different.

00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:57.950
If I think about Myself really, I tell you,

00:46:58.150 --> 00:47:02.470
I feel very happy, nice, joyous, I must tell you, I must confess.

00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:07.630
But some people I think of, immediately My chakras start catching

00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:12.870
and I feel, "Oh, God, why did I think of such a person?"

00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:16.750
I mean, the chakras start moving fast for that person,

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:19.990
because this body is so generous.

00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:23.350
That you can't imagine, even if I see somebody,

00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:27.510
suddenly the chakras start working for that as if I'm responsible

00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:31.710
for everybody's chakras which are gone off,

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:35.830
which I am in a way, but to such an extent.

00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:40.750
But still I think

00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:43.670
about people who are in trouble,

00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:46.150
about every one of you.

00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:48.590
Why? Why do I think?

00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:56.230
Because I know that if I can improve your chakras, you'll be happy.

00:47:57.350 --> 00:48:00.310
I don't have to logically go to that point,

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:04.790
but just My body knows it. It works.

00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:07.350
It works and feels very happy.

00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:10.030
When I see somebody getting their Realisation

00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:11.870
it's such a great joy to Me.

00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:15.430
When I see somebody being relieved of the problem,

00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:17.110
such a joy to Me

00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:27.470
because joy-giving is the character, nature of Spirit.

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:35.070
If you do not allow your Spirit to fulfill its own nature

00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:40.110
and its own character,

00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:45.510
Spirit is not going to manifest itself.

00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:48.470
So you are the vehicle.

00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:52.190
You are the lamp, you can say,

00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:56.510
as far as body, mind is concerned.

00:48:56.710 --> 00:49:01.950
But this light of Spirit, if it has to manifest,

00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:06.470
then it has to be of a very unique type

00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:10.390
that it emits all its light outside.

00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:13.870
It gives light to others.

00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:23.670
And this light-giving quality, you have to improve.

00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:27.710
Gradually you'll be surprised,

00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:30.510
only if you try in your life,

00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:35.150
in your relationships, in your endeavors,

00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:42.870
to give light to others, to make their lives better,

00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:45.390
not to show off, not to be egoïstical,

00:49:45.590 --> 00:49:49.790
but in a very loving, beautiful manner,

00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:53.070
you'll really understand

00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:56.550
that you are the Spirit,

00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:59.030
because Spirit loves.

00:49:59.550 --> 00:50:01.470
It loves.

00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:07.310
And in love you are forgiving, very forgiving.

00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:10.990
Sometimes, leaders get angry with Me that I'm rather forgiving.

00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:15.870
What can I do? That's My nature. I can't help it.

00:50:18.590 --> 00:50:21.070
Because I love, you know.

00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:24.270
If you love a person, you do forgive.

00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:26.870
You don't feel bad.

00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:31.550
Not to forgive is difficult, but to forgive is the best.

00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:36.110
At least, when you forgive there's no headache for you.

00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:41.910
So this Love, which is joy, actually I think,

00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:47.790
when this love melts and flows like a river

00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:52.110
and gives nourishment

00:50:52.310 --> 00:51:01.430
to all the surrounding trees on the shores,

00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:05.550
that is the time,

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:13.870
is the completion of the individuality or a personality

00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:20.270
of that love and that's the time, it feels fulfilled.

00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:25.990
It's not just that you have a light in the corner,

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:29.110
but it has to flow.

00:51:29.310 --> 00:51:31.550
It has to move.

00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:34.350
It has to nourish.

00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:40.350
Love is not something dead, like a stone.

00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:47.550
When it melts, it encompasses everything

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:51.390
and everything becomes very beautiful with that.

00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:55.790
So you have to first understand that

00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:58.950
life is for giving joy to others

00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:04.310
because you are now saints and your light has to give Joy.

00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:07.550
Little bit you have to bear.

00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:09.590
You have powers to bear.

00:52:09.790 --> 00:52:13.310
You have all the powers and so I wish you

00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:19.550
good luck for the next year and great prosperity.

00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:21.670
May God bless you.
