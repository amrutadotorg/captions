1
00:00:04,063 --> 00:00:07,906
Shri Mataji: I bow to all the seekers
of truth.

2
00:00:14,563 --> 00:00:23,023
[Short introduction of Shri Mataji
in Arabic by the Tunisian interviewer.]

3
00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:26,844
Interviewer (Lady): Shri Mataji, which are
the benefits one can get from Sahaja Yoga

4
00:00:27,045 --> 00:00:30,828
and what is special about this technique?

5
00:00:31,383 --> 00:00:36,771
Shri Mataji: First of all, one has to know
that it is the breakthrough

6
00:00:36,972 --> 00:00:43,358
into a new awareness and the last
breakthrough of our evolution.

7
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,488
The benefits are, first of all,

8
00:00:46,689 --> 00:00:54,418
that the fundamental energy centres
within us are called as chakras,

9
00:00:54,619 --> 00:01:00,957
and they are responsible for our physical,
mental, emotional and spiritual being.

10
00:01:01,158 --> 00:01:06,973
So when this power, which is a Kundalini
in the triangular bone called as sacrum -

11
00:01:07,174 --> 00:01:10,418
that shows the Greeks knew it was
a sacred bone -

12
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:14,645
which is awakened and passes through
six centres,

13
00:01:14,846 --> 00:01:22,183
as a result, these centres are integrated
and are nourished and enlightened.

14
00:01:22,384 --> 00:01:26,745
So your physical, mental, emotional and
spiritual problems are solved.

15
00:01:26,946 --> 00:01:32,901
As a result also your financial, political
and income problems are also solved,

16
00:01:33,102 --> 00:01:35,893
because you become a transformed
personality.

17
00:01:36,094 --> 00:01:41,995
And when this transformed personality
starts behaving in a manner

18
00:01:42,196 --> 00:01:48,921
that is so congenial to spirituality,
people are amazed!

19
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:54,690
Now our problem is that we don’t know
the absolute truth.

20
00:01:54,891 --> 00:01:59,707
By this you know the absolute truth and you
become empowered

21
00:01:59,908 --> 00:02:04,659
that you can give Realization to others.
You can solve their problems.

22
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,002
So it is something that, like one
enlightened light can enlighten many.

23
00:02:10,203 --> 00:02:14,968
This is Resurrection as described
in the Koran.

24
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:21,322
[Question in Arabic and in French what
are Shri Mataji’s feeling about Tunisia.]

25
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,352
Interviewer (Lady): Shri Mataji, which is
your feeling coming to Tunisia?

26
00:02:27,529 --> 00:02:30,165
Shri Mataji: I think, it’s a very spiritual
place.

27
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:35,376
Then I heard that there was a great saint
who died here.

28
00:02:35,577 --> 00:02:41,485
That is, I could feel it that his blessings
are here on this country.

29
00:02:41,686 --> 00:02:47,329
And there is such a balance, I’ve seen,
the women are treated so well

30
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:51,227
in this Islamic country, it’s something
remarkable.

31
00:02:51,396 --> 00:02:56,766
And a thing of hope for all the women
of the world in Islamic countries

32
00:02:56,967 --> 00:02:59,633
who are really suffering very much.

33
00:02:59,857 --> 00:03:02,929
Interviewer: Thank you very much,
“merci, madame”.
