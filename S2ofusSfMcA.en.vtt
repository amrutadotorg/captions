00:24:49.023 --> 00:24:54.020
I’m sorry I’ve not been able to speak
to you in English language

00:24:54.053 --> 00:24:59.700
- and I’ve spoken some time. This special
day today is the day of Sankrant.

00:24:59.725 --> 00:25:05.915
Sankr – you know ‘San’ means good,
holy, and ‘krant’ means the –

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:10.339
(A yogi says in a low voice: “Revolution”.
Shri Mataji says some words in marathi)

00:25:10.364 --> 00:25:13.351
When I speak Marathi I forget English –
Yogis: Revolution.

00:25:13.376 --> 00:25:18.084
Shri Mataji: Revolution.
Holy revolution. Holy.

00:25:18.109 --> 00:25:21.463
And that’s what I’m telling them,

00:25:22.439 --> 00:25:26.762
what is the Holy Revolution is, that your
own Dharma is established

00:25:26.787 --> 00:25:29.501
now through Sahaja Yoga. You know
what is your Dharma.

00:25:29.526 --> 00:25:32.127
Because if you don’t do your own
Dharmas

00:25:32.152 --> 00:25:34.801
you’ll be lost. Your vibrations will
be lost.

00:25:34.826 --> 00:25:39.565
You’ll immediately know that in your
seeking you have lost something.

00:25:40.168 --> 00:25:46.413
You’ll be affected and so you have
to correct. That’s not so difficult.

00:25:46.438 --> 00:25:53.665
But to make it a Sankranta – the Holy
Revolution – you have to take to new

00:25:54.364 --> 00:26:00.531
– new religion, new steps. First of all,
your own step should be enlightened,

00:26:00.556 --> 00:26:05.496
and then you have to establish new steps
to go ahead.

00:26:05.521 --> 00:26:08.918
And these are the new steps which
are different

00:26:08.943 --> 00:26:12.559
for the Westerners and different
for the Easterners.

00:26:12.584 --> 00:26:18.267
Just now I told them about the Eastern
style and then I’ll tell you later on

00:26:18.292 --> 00:26:24.485
about the Western. We have to have
new ideals,

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:32.791
new styles because we are the courageous
people, we are the valiant people.

00:26:32.816 --> 00:26:39.853
We have to fight the war of love,
through love.

00:26:41.256 --> 00:26:48.447
And it’s a very delicate thing. When
the moon moves – the sun moves –

00:26:48.472 --> 00:26:56.094
from the left to the right that means
your desire becomes your action.

00:26:56.119 --> 00:27:00.619
Today is the day they give you a sweet
thing to say that

00:27:00.644 --> 00:27:08.343
you must speak sweetly which is very
important for Western people;

00:27:09.359 --> 00:27:15.255
that when you are doing and organizing
you become heated up,

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:21.609
there’s tension and you develop the
temperament which is dry, emotionless.

00:27:21.634 --> 00:27:25.606
You know the heart goes into a tantrum.

00:27:25.631 --> 00:27:30.875
At that time they say that you take
the sweet.This sweet is a heating thing

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:38.780
because now the sun is moving towards
the other side.

00:27:38.805 --> 00:27:43.209
That time also they, to give it a balance,
they say: “Speak very sweetly.

00:27:43.234 --> 00:27:47.285
Use sweet words, use sweetness.

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:51.823
Bring sweetness in your language.”
- Which is very important,

00:27:51.848 --> 00:27:56.643
you understand that. And this is one
of the religions we have to accept

00:27:56.668 --> 00:28:04.161
that we will not use harsh words to each
other and then later on to others.

00:28:04.186 --> 00:28:07.515
First of all to each other. There are many
people who will be kind to others

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:11.710
because others will eat them off but
unkind to their own sahaja yogis.

00:28:11.735 --> 00:28:18.576
Because it is a universal happening. It’s
the whole thing is working out universally.

00:28:18.601 --> 00:28:23.156
Even if you organize, you organize
for the whole.

00:28:24.384 --> 00:28:30.062
Those who are organizing have no business
to be harsh

00:28:30.087 --> 00:28:35.434
and those who are not organizing has
no business to be slow.

00:28:35.459 --> 00:28:40.120
We must move with the same speed,
with the same understanding.

00:28:40.145 --> 00:28:47.114
There’s a story in Marathi language
which is a very good story that a –

00:28:48.447 --> 00:28:56.072
[Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi]
- the bird-catcher had put lots of

00:28:56.097 --> 00:29:03.057
temptations of good grain for some birds
– pigeons

00:29:03.082 --> 00:29:10.268
and the pigeons didn’t see the nest [net]
– the trap -

00:29:10.293 --> 00:29:17.455
and they all came down to eat that.
And there was a net there.

00:29:18.408 --> 00:29:23.240
In the net their feet were entangled.

00:29:23.893 --> 00:29:30.987
So the solution was found out that:
‘If all of us with the same speed

00:29:31.797 --> 00:29:40.662
take off, we’ll take away the whole
of the net and then he cannot catch us.’

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.993
So, one person said: ‘Alright, as soon
as I say ‘yes’,

00:29:44.018 --> 00:29:46.736
let us all start with the same speed.

00:29:46.761 --> 00:29:51.440
If somebody increases his speed
he is brought down.

00:29:52.286 --> 00:29:56.200
In the same way Sahaja Yoga has to be
worked out;

00:29:56.225 --> 00:30:01.326
and that’s why to keep up the speed
keep yourself

00:30:01.351 --> 00:30:06.540
peaceful, loving, affectionate.

00:30:06.565 --> 00:30:10.094
Peace is the way we are going
to achieve it.

00:30:10.119 --> 00:30:14.497
This is an explosive peace.

00:30:15.034 --> 00:30:19.947
By giving contrasts you bring the balance
in: explosive.

00:30:19.972 --> 00:30:24.214
You have read also about the Goddess
– the different aspects of Goddess.

00:30:24.239 --> 00:30:27.980
Always: ‘Ati saumya, Ati Raudra’ [gentle
like the Moon and terrible like Rudra]

00:30:28.005 --> 00:30:33.573
To give the two contrasts by which bring
the balance in the middle.

00:30:33.598 --> 00:30:41.967
That’s how you must understand that
Sahaja Yoga is a very unique revolution.

00:30:41.992 --> 00:30:46.870
I told them also politically and also
socially – in every way

00:30:46.895 --> 00:30:51.817
how we are going to improve every
country.

00:30:51.842 --> 00:30:56.866
Thus the whole world – the whole universe.

00:30:56.891 --> 00:31:01.258
Later on I’ll translate the whole thing
for you.

00:31:01.283 --> 00:31:05.923
So today’s special day, very great day,

00:31:05.948 --> 00:31:12.729
let us ask that – when you are doing
this Puja,

00:31:12.754 --> 00:31:20.762
ask for new religions within you to be
enshrined,

00:31:20.787 --> 00:31:27.607
to be sustained within ourselves and try
to imbibe them.

00:31:27.632 --> 00:31:30.894
They will be permeating but you have
to accept them;

00:31:30.919 --> 00:31:34.939
and [you] should know it’s a big fight;

00:31:35.456 --> 00:31:40.577
and it’s a very different type of a fight
of peace and love.

00:31:40.602 --> 00:31:46.562
That’s why they say: ‘Speak sweetly.
Be sweet with others.

00:31:47.487 --> 00:31:55.103
Not to be sarcastic by any chance,
nor to be harsh, but be sweet.

00:31:55.128 --> 00:32:00.314
Sweetness which is genuine, not outward
and showing and formal,

00:32:00.339 --> 00:32:04.895
but genuine sweetness.
May God bless you all.
