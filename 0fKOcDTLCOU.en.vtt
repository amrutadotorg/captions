00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:12.712
Today, we are going to do Puja to Shiva,
Shri Shiva.

00:00:14.201 --> 00:00:25.808
As you know Shri Shiva is the reflection
of Sadashiva within us.

00:00:26.101 --> 00:00:30.478
I have already told about the reflection.

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:36.050
Sadashiva is the God Almighty,

00:00:38.645 --> 00:00:45.679
the One who sees the play of Adi Shakti.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.876
But He is the Father

00:00:54.526 --> 00:01:02.680
who is watching each one of His Creation
or Her Creation.

00:01:04.253 --> 00:01:16.647
His support to Adi Shakti is entirely,
fully strengthening.

00:01:18.052 --> 00:01:27.318
There’s no doubt in His mind about
the capability of the Adi Shakti.

00:01:27.977 --> 00:01:36.535
But when He finds that, in the play
of Adi Shakti,

00:01:38.351 --> 00:01:47.763
the people of the world as such, try
to disturb Her,

00:01:47.964 --> 00:01:56.768
or spoil Her work then He gets
into His wrathful mood

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:07.122
and He destroys all such people and maybe
He destroys the whole world.

00:02:11.833 --> 00:02:15.297
On one side He is wrathful no doubt,

00:02:15.498 --> 00:02:22.813
on the other side He's the ocean
of compassion and joy.

00:02:23.798 --> 00:02:28.874
That's why when He's reflected within us

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:36.266
we get our Self-realization. We get
the light of our spirit

00:02:36.467 --> 00:02:43.827
and we get into the ocean of joy.

00:02:44.112 --> 00:02:49.421
Also He is the ocean of knowledge,

00:02:49.622 --> 00:02:57.562
So, those who get self-realized get
the knowledge of the Divine,

00:02:58.221 --> 00:03:08.803
which is very subtle, permeating into every
atom and molecule,

00:03:09.454 --> 00:03:16.043
the power of this knowledge is there.

00:03:18.726 --> 00:03:25.665
His style is such that in His compassion

00:03:25.866 --> 00:03:35.450
He forgives even very cruel rakshasas

00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:41.211
if they dedicate themselves to Him,

00:03:41.412 --> 00:03:48.975
because His compassion has no limits.
And sometimes

00:03:49.176 --> 00:04:00.043
the same people who are blessed by Him try
to trouble the devotees of Adi Shakti.

00:04:01.685 --> 00:04:06.348
But it is just to create a drama, a event.

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:11.631
Unless and until there is some drama
people won’t understand.

00:04:11.832 --> 00:04:17.846
We had to have Ramayana, we had to have
Mahabharata,

00:04:18.047 --> 00:04:25.005
we had to have Christ being crucified, we
had to have Mohammed being tortured.

00:04:25.767 --> 00:04:34.722
All that drama was there because without
events people don’t remember.

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:42.236
So in the spiritual life of human beings
they have seen lots of dramas

00:04:42.437 --> 00:04:51.661
between the blessings of Shiva and
the powers of the Adi Shakti.

00:04:55.544 --> 00:05:01.236
As the time has moved today in the history
of spirituality

00:05:01.437 --> 00:05:10.325
a great discovery has been made. That
people can get their realization

00:05:10.526 --> 00:05:15.729
in the collective, en-masse. Thousands can
get their realization.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.971
Now we should know what is this
Realization we have got.

00:05:21.172 --> 00:05:26.498
What does that mean and what is
the culminating point.

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:33.101
First of all, I have to tell you the mind
about which we speak

00:05:33.302 --> 00:05:39.962
and depend upon is a myth. There’s nothing
like mind.

00:05:40.163 --> 00:05:43.990
Brain is reality, not the mind.

00:05:44.191 --> 00:05:50.079
Mind is created by us reacting to outside,

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.232
either we react to conditionings or
to our ego.

00:05:55.433 --> 00:06:02.104
Thus this mind is created like bubbles
on the ocean of reality,

00:06:02.305 --> 00:06:07.683
but that’s not reality. With this mind
whatever we decide

00:06:07.884 --> 00:06:18.886
we know is very limited, illusive and
sometimes shocking.

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:23.708
The mind always moves in a linear
direction,

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:29.269
and because there's no reality in it,
it recoils and boomerangs.

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:39.107
Thus all the enterprises, all
the projections so far we have done,

00:06:39.308 --> 00:06:45.158
it seems, come back to us. Whatever they
discover

00:06:45.359 --> 00:06:53.757
comes back to us as a big destructive power
or a very big shock.

00:06:54.773 --> 00:07:04.085
So one has to decide what to do, how to be
out of this trap of our mind.

00:07:04.768 --> 00:07:09.975
Kundalini is the solution. When She’s
awakened, She takes you -

00:07:10.176 --> 00:07:14.611
with that awakening She takes you beyond
your mind.

00:07:14.812 --> 00:07:20.805
The first thing is to go beyond your mind.
With mind you’ll do many things

00:07:21.006 --> 00:07:27.054
but it will not be satisfying, it will be
not a solution, it will not help you.

00:07:27.255 --> 00:07:30.210
And when we start depending too much
on our mind

00:07:30.411 --> 00:07:34.825
we develop all kinds of physical, mental,
emotional problem.

00:07:35.026 --> 00:07:41.082
Now the latest is the stress. Stress, and
this stress has no solution they say,

00:07:41.283 --> 00:07:49.457
but in Sahaja Yoga we find the solution
by crossing over this mind.

00:07:52.508 --> 00:08:01.142
It’s like a barrier for our advancement.
So, when you get your realization,

00:08:01.343 --> 00:08:08.595
you must understand that your Kundalini
has taken your attention beyond the mind.

00:08:08.795 --> 00:08:14.689
Now, this reaction to outside has come
because we human beings have

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:20.115
a prism-like brain, or we can say
a prism-like skull,

00:08:20.316 --> 00:08:26.385
and when the energy passes into it,
I have explained it in My books,

00:08:26.586 --> 00:08:30.434
it goes into bifurcations or you can say
refractions

00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:35.563
by which our attention goes out and we
react.

00:08:36.524 --> 00:08:42.659
If we react too much then these bubbles
create a very horrible mind

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:52.142
which can lead to any kind of thing.
It justifies itself, it pampers your ego.

00:08:52.343 --> 00:08:58.178
The ego and the conditioning that creates
this mind

00:08:58.379 --> 00:09:06.677
start using and - this mind, for
the purpose of their fulfillment,

00:09:06.878 --> 00:09:16.690
of their all the accumulation of ideas
and thoughts

00:09:16.891 --> 00:09:21.947
which has no backing, which has no reality
with it.

00:09:22.148 --> 00:09:29.997
It’s like we make the computer, ultimately
we become slaves of the computer.

00:09:30.198 --> 00:09:35.044
We make the watches ourselves and then
we become slaves of the watches.

00:09:35.245 --> 00:09:41.384
That’s how it dominates human beings and
when a person

00:09:41.585 --> 00:09:48.362
who has a very strong mind decides
to destroy, like Hitler did,

00:09:48.563 --> 00:09:54.923
with some idea he can go on destroying
which has a very far-fetched effect

00:09:55.124 --> 00:09:59.254
on our culture, on our spirituality.

00:09:59.455 --> 00:10:04.681
Now the first step is to become
thoughtlessly aware,

00:10:04.882 --> 00:10:10.662
where you cross your mind. You go above
your mind.

00:10:10.863 --> 00:10:16.721
Mind cannot affect you. This is the first
stage as we call is thoughtless awareness.

00:10:16.922 --> 00:10:23.333
Second one is where, you see, start seeing
the working of this Paramachaitanya,

00:10:23.534 --> 00:10:28.605
of this all-pervading Power and you start
becoming aware

00:10:28.806 --> 00:10:36.560
that there is lot of truth in what Mataji
says.

00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:41.776
That there is this power, which works out
many things.

00:10:41.977 --> 00:10:45.635
It works miraculously so many things
for you.

00:10:45.836 --> 00:10:53.150
It gives you blessings, it guides you,
it helps you, in so many ways it helps you.

00:10:53.351 --> 00:10:59.970
It gives you good health, good wealth and
also a very good society

00:11:00.171 --> 00:11:04.451
of very beautiful people in the collective.

00:11:04.652 --> 00:11:08.727
All that you can see clearly is happening
here.

00:11:11.124 --> 00:11:17.139
Now this happening of

00:11:23.041 --> 00:11:30.920
achieving thoughtless awareness is very
simple and easy,

00:11:31.121 --> 00:11:39.590
but to maintain at that point is difficult.
We still react and we think.

00:11:39.791 --> 00:11:47.260
Anything you see you react. To get to that
point in thoughtless awareness

00:11:47.461 --> 00:11:53.911
is first, to change your attention.

00:11:54.112 --> 00:12:02.581
Now for example, once we were climbing
a very high mountain to see one temple

00:12:02.782 --> 00:12:07.800
called Palitana. Myself, My son-in-law and
My daughter.

00:12:08.001 --> 00:12:12.626
And we were really tired because we had
to climb - I don't know how many steps

00:12:12.827 --> 00:12:16.067
and when we went up we were tired and there
was a little canopy

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:22.279
made of beautiful marble carving, so we
just laid down ourselves.

00:12:22.594 --> 00:12:27.972
They were very tired and they said, "What is
this kind of a temple," they were grudging.

00:12:28.173 --> 00:12:36.249
While I looked up and I saw lots
of beautiful elephants were carved.

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:39.868
So I told My son-in-law, "Look at these
elephants,

00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:43.359
they all have tails of different types."

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:49.834
He said, "Mommy, we are all dying, how can
You see the tails of elephants?"

00:12:50.035 --> 00:12:56.765
But is just to divert their attention from
that tiredness, I told them that,

00:12:56.933 --> 00:13:01.698
why not see these tails of the elephant,
which is very different.

00:13:01.899 --> 00:13:08.699
So what happens that when you are putting
your attention

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:12.633
so much to outside all the time,

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:18.070
then you must first of all also divert
your attention.

00:13:18.271 --> 00:13:22.543
For example, you see these beautifully made
things here.

00:13:22.744 --> 00:13:27.464
Your attention is something else, just try
to enjoy the beauty of that.

00:13:27.665 --> 00:13:33.384
See there are beautiful carpets here, just
look at them without thinking,

00:13:33.598 --> 00:13:37.531
because they don't belong to you so no
headache, they belong to somebody else

00:13:37.732 --> 00:13:40.898
is very good. Otherwise if it belongs
to you, you'll will start thinking,

00:13:41.099 --> 00:13:44.818
"Oh my God, I've spreading them here what
will happen, they have to be insured”

00:13:45.019 --> 00:13:50.187
or some sort of thing like that. That's
common human reaction

00:13:50.388 --> 00:13:53.843
but if it doesn't belong to you, you can
watch it nicely.

00:13:54.044 --> 00:13:58.129
Now you watch it and don't think, you'll be
amazed

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:02.032
when you see the beauty that is put inside
this.

00:14:02.233 --> 00:14:06.897
You'll see the artist who has put his joy,
his exuberance into it

00:14:07.098 --> 00:14:12.979
and you'll be amazed after realization that
this exuberance

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:19.875
will fill into you and a cool kind
of a relaxation will come into you

00:14:20.076 --> 00:14:26.790
and this Kundalini will rise and you’ll
become steady in your thoughtless awareness.

00:14:26.991 --> 00:14:35.111
So whenever you look at anything, look
at any beautiful thing,

00:14:35.312 --> 00:14:41.172
even say today's election, just watch
the man who is elected [John Howard].

00:14:41.373 --> 00:14:46.246
Watching him itself gives him blessings,
gives him better ideas.

00:14:46.447 --> 00:14:53.717
You get also ideas which are coming
from reality, which are there,

00:14:53.918 --> 00:15:02.382
how to make this man a successful person
or this country a successful democracy.

00:15:02.583 --> 00:15:07.741
All these things happen when your attention
is diverted

00:15:07.942 --> 00:15:14.454
from criticising, from reacting,

00:15:14.655 --> 00:15:19.527
just you watch, become the witness, try
to witness everything.

00:15:19.728 --> 00:15:23.670
It's not so very yet practiced,

00:15:23.871 --> 00:15:30.244
so far I've seen, that whenever even we get
our, achieve our realization

00:15:30.445 --> 00:15:35.178
we don't realize that we have to witness
everything.

00:15:35.379 --> 00:15:39.798
When you start witnessing through your
spirit, then you don't see

00:15:39.999 --> 00:15:44.362
the bad points of another, but you see
the good points.

00:15:44.563 --> 00:15:50.205
We just pick up a person with very good
points.

00:15:50.406 --> 00:15:57.594
So once you see that the witness state
enlarges

00:15:57.795 --> 00:16:03.516
and you start enjoying another person, you
start enjoying everything that is there.

00:16:03.717 --> 00:16:11.450
Even a small blade of grass you can enjoy
if you have that capacity.

00:16:12.481 --> 00:16:17.961
In Japan Zen system started on these lines.

00:16:18.162 --> 00:16:24.115
And he made - Viditama was the person who
started it.

00:16:24.316 --> 00:16:33.588
He made a garden out of moss, different
moss, very small, small.

00:16:33.789 --> 00:16:40.260
There were little, little flowers also. And
hardly about five feet of the garden,

00:16:40.461 --> 00:16:46.135
which looks like the shape of a question
mark, you can say.

00:16:46.336 --> 00:16:51.597
You have to go on a lift and you reach that
platform

00:16:51.798 --> 00:16:56.180
on top of a hill or a mountain where you
see this.

00:16:56.381 --> 00:16:59.286
All little, little mosses are there

00:16:59.487 --> 00:17:04.211
and you see differently arranged a beautiful
garden.

00:17:04.489 --> 00:17:08.861
When you start seeing it your thought
stops.

00:17:09.062 --> 00:17:12.861
Because such a marvelous thing, when you
put attention to it,

00:17:13.062 --> 00:17:17.183
to its creation, your thoughts stop. So you
must practice

00:17:17.384 --> 00:17:24.551
as to find out what stops your thoughts.
What makes you the witness?

00:17:24.752 --> 00:17:29.946
Once you develop this habit you will
station yourself nicely

00:17:30.147 --> 00:17:34.805
in the thoughtless awareness. Then you
start watching

00:17:35.006 --> 00:17:41.694
how Sahaja Yoga has helped you. How it has
been blissful.

00:17:41.895 --> 00:17:45.467
What you have achieved through Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:45.668 --> 00:17:49.310
You will be amazed if you just start
watching it

00:17:49.511 --> 00:17:56.178
everywhere you'll be amazed how this
Paramachaitanya acts.

00:17:56.379 --> 00:18:01.507
Nowadays this Paramachaitanya has become
active because of Krita Yuga.

00:18:01.708 --> 00:18:08.650
You can see from the way it is playing
around with vibrations around Me,

00:18:08.851 --> 00:18:14.761
you've seen so many photographs of Mine
where these vibrations are there.

00:18:14.962 --> 00:18:18.760
Also you've seen the photographs of many
Sahaja yogis sitting before Me,

00:18:18.961 --> 00:18:23.182
on their head My name is written down
in Arabic language.

00:18:23.383 --> 00:18:27.116
You've seen so many ways by which you can
find out

00:18:27.317 --> 00:18:31.714
that there is the play of the Divine.

00:18:31.915 --> 00:18:38.706
Now the mind will still try to say some
things, don't listen, just watch.

00:18:39.373 --> 00:18:44.151
The effect of Sahaja Yoga you should watch,
on yourself, on your body.

00:18:44.352 --> 00:18:49.169
Don't think about it, but watch it and
you'll be amazed how you have changed.

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:52.512
To be very frank when I come to Australia
every year

00:18:52.713 --> 00:18:56.607
sometimes I can't even recognize you.
You look much younger,

00:18:56.808 --> 00:19:03.510
much better, much happier and I don't
recognize who are these people.

00:19:03.711 --> 00:19:09.288
It is this witness state which takes you
to another realm

00:19:09.489 --> 00:19:13.076
which we call as doubtless awareness.

00:19:13.277 --> 00:19:22.090
At that state you can become so empowered
that you can give realization to others.

00:19:26.304 --> 00:19:32.479
You can give realization to others. You can
give

00:19:33.304 --> 00:19:41.128
complete knowledge about Sahaja Yoga, you
can talk to them. Also you emit -

00:19:41.329 --> 00:19:46.255
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi].

00:19:47.953 --> 00:19:55.312
I'm, you see, when I'm watching I'm
absorbing the heat, that's My trouble.

00:19:56.701 --> 00:20:05.236
So your whole state, spiritual state,

00:20:05.437 --> 00:20:09.787
becomes so much blissful. You become
so powerful.

00:20:09.988 --> 00:20:16.971
You become so compassionate and so loving,
so balanced,

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:22.678
completely cleansed with all the destructive
ideas you have,

00:20:22.879 --> 00:20:29.039
all the depressive ideas you have, and then
you really stand up

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:34.629
as a great Sahaji, who can do tremendous
work.

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:42.020
Like recently I heard that Germans and
Austrians are now going to Israel

00:20:42.221 --> 00:20:45.642
because they think Jews were killed
by their forefathers.

00:20:45.843 --> 00:20:50.409
And there's a big center now start[ed]
in Israel. Just imagine

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:55.875
how these people once reach that state,
go to countries single-handed,

00:20:56.076 --> 00:20:59.535
they have done so much. Same in Turkey,

00:20:59.736 --> 00:21:09.779
same in places, which are very tremendously
remote in South Africa.

00:21:11.199 --> 00:21:16.309
Because from inside they become completely
confident

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:24.163
in thoughtless awareness as well as
doubtlessly aware.

00:21:24.364 --> 00:21:30.174
But now once you start growing by meditative
attention,

00:21:30.351 --> 00:21:34.359
what happens that your attention becomes
enlightened.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.871
Now the job is to motivate your attention.

00:21:39.072 --> 00:21:46.933
It's not just to enjoy, but to motivate it,
to put it to problems.

00:21:47.142 --> 00:21:52.490
Now supposing you have some problem
on a national basis

00:21:52.691 --> 00:21:57.440
you all can put your attention to that and
things will work out.

00:21:58.416 --> 00:22:03.304
Because you are the channel of this
all-pervading Power

00:22:03.486 --> 00:22:09.555
which is trying to create a new world
for you, new human beings.

00:22:09.756 --> 00:22:15.192
And this evolution can take place very fast
if you all decide

00:22:15.393 --> 00:22:20.528
that whatever we have now within ourselves
we should motivate it,

00:22:20.729 --> 00:22:25.166
we should direct it and put this attention
to some use.

00:22:25.367 --> 00:22:31.245
It should not be wasted. Whatever wealth
we have it should not be wasted.

00:22:32.302 --> 00:22:38.190
Now this main question today, which
I'm going to tell you about

00:22:38.391 --> 00:22:44.192
that what is God's realization. First is
the Self-realization

00:22:44.393 --> 00:22:49.241
and there are many ambitious people who
want to become God's-realized.

00:22:49.442 --> 00:22:55.014
First and foremost thing we should know
that human beings cannot become God.

00:22:55.215 --> 00:22:58.019
It's not the becoming of it.

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:04.509
You have not become also in a way spirit
because the spirit is emitting through you,

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:09.397
using you, giving you, looking after you.

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:16.068
If you become the spirit there won't be
any body left, nothing will be left.

00:23:16.269 --> 00:23:21.068
So with this body intact, your spirit
is acting through this body,

00:23:21.269 --> 00:23:24.804
is giving you all the light.

00:23:25.215 --> 00:23:31.016
But one cannot become God Almighty; this
one has to understand very clearly.

00:23:31.217 --> 00:23:36.578
But what is God's realization is to know
about God.

00:23:38.133 --> 00:23:47.469
You see, to know about God means to know
how His powers are working.

00:23:49.524 --> 00:23:56.770
How He controls by becoming part and parcel
of God Almighty.

00:23:56.971 --> 00:24:05.263
Like My finger doesn't know about My brain,
but it acts according to My brain.

00:24:05.464 --> 00:24:08.914
The finger cannot become the brain,

00:24:09.115 --> 00:24:14.395
but it has to act absolutely according
to My brain

00:24:14.596 --> 00:24:18.817
because it is so connected, it is so one.

00:24:19.018 --> 00:24:25.380
Here when you have the God's realization
then you know about the brain,

00:24:25.581 --> 00:24:33.206
you know about God, you know about His
powers, you know everything about Him.

00:24:33.407 --> 00:24:39.943
As far as I'm concerned it's a difficult
task for you, because I'm a Mahamaya.

00:24:40.144 --> 00:24:43.853
It's very difficult for you to know each
and everything about Me.

00:24:44.054 --> 00:24:49.095
I'm quite a elusive person as you know that
well,

00:24:49.296 --> 00:24:57.297
and whatever I do or whatever I achieve,
it is just for you to see and understand

00:24:57.498 --> 00:25:03.059
that after all this is Adi Shakti and She
can do all these things.

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:07.797
You can also do all the things but you
cannot become Me.

00:25:07.998 --> 00:25:17.159
But you have to know, to know through
love, through devotion, through prayers

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:23.080
to know the God's Powers is the way you are
God-realized.

00:25:23.281 --> 00:25:28.288
Then you can control the nature, you can
control everything,

00:25:28.489 --> 00:25:32.791
if you have that knowledge within you
about God.

00:25:32.992 --> 00:25:38.993
For that a complete humility is needed that
you cannot become God,

00:25:39.194 --> 00:25:43.038
cannot become God Almighty. You cannot
become the deities

00:25:43.239 --> 00:25:49.635
but definitely you can become God-realized.
Means God acts through you,

00:25:49.836 --> 00:25:56.093
uses you as His power, as His channel and
that you know, that you know

00:25:56.294 --> 00:26:00.329
what He's doing to you, what He's telling,
what His vision is

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:05.206
and what is the information. The connection
is like that.

00:26:05.407 --> 00:26:10.017
Many people in Sahaja Yoga have been
benefited, I know.

00:26:10.218 --> 00:26:14.391
But they don't know how they have been
benefited. What has worked it out?

00:26:14.592 --> 00:26:19.250
How it has worked it out. What connection
of theirs has helped them?

00:26:19.451 --> 00:26:26.578
Once you do that, you know that, clearly
how things are working out,

00:26:26.779 --> 00:26:33.305
with what power you have achieved it, then
it's a God's realization.

00:26:33.506 --> 00:26:38.567
Such people become extremely powerful
in the sense

00:26:38.768 --> 00:26:43.763
that they can control so many things.

00:26:46.207 --> 00:26:49.263
There have been many saints of that kind

00:26:49.464 --> 00:26:55.710
but sometimes they fell from even that and
they developed their ego.

00:26:55.911 --> 00:26:59.178
They didn't have their own humility that
they should have,

00:26:59.379 --> 00:27:04.711
that devotion, that dedication, that
surrendering.

00:27:05.133 --> 00:27:10.932
They fell down and you see them, I've seen
some of them that they become

00:27:11.149 --> 00:27:16.637
quite proud of their achievements and they
don't want to give it to anyone.

00:27:16.838 --> 00:27:19.293
They think they have achieved it with great
difficulties

00:27:19.486 --> 00:27:26.275
and why should they give it to others. Such
people are not going to rise very higher.

00:27:26.476 --> 00:27:31.619
But you people who have got your realization
and who are humble,

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:40.463
who know that out of humility only you are
going to achieve your surrendering.

00:27:40.664 --> 00:27:45.795
Islam means surrender. Mohammed Sahib has
talked about Islam,

00:27:45.996 --> 00:27:51.562
meaning, "you surrender." If you cannot
surrender you can never know God.

00:27:51.763 --> 00:27:55.364
Is clearly said that, "Unless and until you
know yourself

00:27:55.565 --> 00:27:58.782
you will not know about God."

00:27:58.983 --> 00:28:05.272
So as Sahajis you have to know all
the little, little things,

00:28:05.473 --> 00:28:09.902
all the big things, and all the great
visions,

00:28:10.103 --> 00:28:17.716
that you can do it because of the grace
of God, because His blessings,

00:28:17.917 --> 00:28:25.175
because of His love for you, that you have
entered into the Kingdom of God.

00:28:25.376 --> 00:28:31.363
I may say you have entered, I may say you
have achieved that state,

00:28:31.564 --> 00:28:38.165
I may say that. But still you are not
there.

00:28:38.366 --> 00:28:43.345
It's like if I tell somebody, "Now you are
in Australia."

00:28:43.546 --> 00:28:46.805
He's not in Australia, but I can say you
are in Australia.

00:28:47.006 --> 00:28:49.569
So he believes, "I am in Australia", that's
not the way.

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:54.693
You have to be in Australia, then you have
to know about Australia.

00:28:54.894 --> 00:29:00.055
You have to know what sort of climate
it is, what sort of things it is.

00:29:00.256 --> 00:29:05.649
I find the also the parents here have
to talk to their children.

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:10.727
There's not much rapport of the parents
with the children.

00:29:10.928 --> 00:29:18.948
They are being properly looked after
in the school and they want to do a lot

00:29:19.149 --> 00:29:22.995
but the parents also must get involved when
the children come here

00:29:23.196 --> 00:29:27.641
to see that they develop proper discipline,
proper sense.

00:29:27.842 --> 00:29:33.940
Not to get attached to them, to ruin them.
If you get attached then you'll ruin them.

00:29:34.141 --> 00:29:38.148
One of the qualities of Shiva is complete
detachment

00:29:38.349 --> 00:29:45.018
and that is what you have to develop, is
to become completely detached.

00:29:45.743 --> 00:29:50.886
Detachment doesn't mean that you neglect
anything.

00:29:51.087 --> 00:29:55.845
I've explained to you many-a-times that
like the sap in the tree rises,

00:29:56.046 --> 00:30:00.543
goes to different, various places and then
evaporates

00:30:00.744 --> 00:30:05.956
or it goes back to Mother Earth. In the
same way your detachment should be.

00:30:06.157 --> 00:30:10.696
If you get attached because it's your son
or if you get attached

00:30:10.897 --> 00:30:16.911
because he's Australian or maybe he belongs
to certain family

00:30:17.112 --> 00:30:20.466
or certain class then you are still
limited.

00:30:20.667 --> 00:30:25.009
All these limitations have to be dropped,
if you have to cross over.

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:31.433
And these limitations create such a big
load that whatever I may try,

00:30:31.634 --> 00:30:37.786
whatever you may try you cannot stay
in thoughtless awareness.

00:30:37.987 --> 00:30:42.666
That's a very beautiful state in which
all of you should be there.

00:30:42.867 --> 00:30:46.973
In that you are not dominating nor you are
compromising.

00:30:47.174 --> 00:30:50.743
You stand on your own legs and you know
for definite

00:30:50.944 --> 00:30:59.263
that you are not swayed away by any idea
or any domination

00:30:59.464 --> 00:31:07.079
or any subjection of yours by anyone. So
you become a completely a free bird,

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:16.280
absolutely a free bird, and then it becomes
your job to achieve your flight.

00:31:16.481 --> 00:31:21.716
One flight is up to the thoughtless
awareness.

00:31:21.917 --> 00:31:27.116
The second one is up to the doubtless
awareness

00:31:27.317 --> 00:31:31.398
and the third one is to God's realization.

00:31:31.599 --> 00:31:36.898
I've seen people who are very close to Me
also don't understand.

00:31:37.099 --> 00:31:41.313
They behave in such a manner as if now
they've become gods.

00:31:41.514 --> 00:31:48.329
So egoistical they are that I am amazed at
them. Then they have to leave Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:48.507 --> 00:31:56.002
So you see, even if I praise you too much,
if I say anything too much,

00:31:56.203 --> 00:32:01.034
you shouldn't get pampered. It's a testing
ground.

00:32:01.235 --> 00:32:06.780
Or otherwise also if I tell you that,

00:32:06.981 --> 00:32:12.306
"This is not good, you should improve
on this", you shouldn't mind,

00:32:12.507 --> 00:32:19.448
because I have to do it, that's My job.
And your job is to listen to Me.

00:32:19.649 --> 00:32:23.818
Because I have nothing to gain from you.
I do not ask for anything.

00:32:24.019 --> 00:32:30.775
What I want is you all should get all My
powers. You may not become what I am,

00:32:30.976 --> 00:32:35.993
agreed, but please try to get all
the powers that I have.

00:32:36.194 --> 00:32:39.053
Which is not a difficult thing.

00:32:39.254 --> 00:32:46.780
This is what is God's realization. That's
what is to know Shiva and Sadashiva.

00:32:46.981 --> 00:32:50.861
Through the Shiva you know Sadashiva.
You see the reflection

00:32:51.062 --> 00:32:58.134
and from reflection you know who is
the original.

00:32:58.335 --> 00:33:05.379
From the reflection you learn. Thus you
reach that state where you think

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:10.092
you are now definitely settled
in the Kingdom of God

00:33:10.293 --> 00:33:16.867
and that you can see God, you can feel God,

00:33:17.068 --> 00:33:20.365
you can understand God.

00:33:21.977 --> 00:33:25.569
And you can love God.

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:28.020
So may God bless you.
