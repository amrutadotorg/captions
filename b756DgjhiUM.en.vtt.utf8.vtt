00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.163
Today is a sad day for Me because

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.772
we'll be now parting.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.996
I may not be able to meet you in Bombay.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:26.330
May be for a year this may not happen for some of you,

00:00:35.622 --> 00:00:41.747
and I would like to give you

00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:49.747
a little advice about the growth within yourself.

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:00.747
It is believed by people

00:01:05.121 --> 00:01:09.247
that God is helping us

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:12.038
and we are in His kingdom.

00:01:13.121 --> 00:01:16.955
So whatever happens He looks after us.

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:21.247
It is true

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.871
but as you are the instrument of the God

00:01:26.247 --> 00:01:28.497
you have to also look after yourself.

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.080
For today's delay

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:33.664
I would like to apologize

00:01:33.996 --> 00:01:35.497
but the delay comes

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.163
because from Poona Mr. Kulkarni was to come

00:01:39.497 --> 00:01:41.996
and see us do this puja.

00:01:42.288 --> 00:01:45.372
Now I told him .?..

00:01:46.871 --> 00:01:48.996
that his wife is a negative lady,

00:01:49.247 --> 00:01:52.664
and he doesn't understand his own importance, I would say.

00:01:52.955 --> 00:01:56.288
As a leader you must understand your importance.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.080
And another person who came,

00:01:59.372 --> 00:02:00.497
he asked, "Why don't you come with me?"

00:02:00.664 --> 00:02:02.247
He said, "I have to come with my wife."

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.247
And that's how this delay has taken place

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:07.664
because he's not here.

00:02:07.955 --> 00:02:09.789
He said he'll come for puja

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.497
so the main thing was first to arrive here in time

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:16.163
without a negative force pulling him.

00:02:16.497 --> 00:02:19.497
So we conclude that

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:23.080
it is important that first of all we should know

00:02:23.372 --> 00:02:26.664
that in any way we should not try

00:02:26.955 --> 00:02:30.163
to have  any negative forces attacking us

00:02:30.455 --> 00:02:33.664
or involving us or attaching to us.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.789
She may be your wife,

00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:36.913
may be your husband,

00:02:39.205 --> 00:02:41.205
may be your son, may be your daughter,

00:02:41.497 --> 00:02:42.205
may be anyone.

00:02:42.497 --> 00:02:45.205
You must see that that person is negative

00:02:47.205 --> 00:02:48.330
through vibrations

00:02:49.622 --> 00:02:52.789
and don't have anything to do with such a person.

00:02:53.372 --> 00:02:56.996
Don't have, never listen to such a person,

00:02:57.288 --> 00:03:00.288
never agree to what that person says

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.288
and do as you please

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.871
because in vibrations you will know

00:03:05.121 --> 00:03:06.913
that the person  is negative.

00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:09.330
Of course that doesn't give you a hand

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:12.413
to sort of a destroy another person

00:03:12.747 --> 00:03:17.038
or to completely

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.955
finish Sahaja Yoga in that person.

00:03:22.247 --> 00:03:24.163
But on the contrary with love

00:03:24.455 --> 00:03:29.664
and proper advice you have to tell that person

00:03:29.955 --> 00:03:34.163
that, "You are being negative, you are a negative person.

00:03:34.455 --> 00:03:36.871
We are getting negative vibrations from you."

00:03:37.163 --> 00:03:41.372
Now that person may persist on the negativity,

00:03:41.664 --> 00:03:45.664
may be because he does not know how to get out of it

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.163
or may be she does not know how to get rid of it

00:03:49.455 --> 00:03:51.121
or may be laziness.

00:03:51.413 --> 00:03:53.830
May be that her arrogance,

00:03:54.121 --> 00:03:55.913
because such people can be very arrogant

00:03:56.247 --> 00:03:58.330
and adamant and high-handed,

00:03:58.622 --> 00:04:00.330
could be very arbitrary also

00:04:00.622 --> 00:04:03.121
and could be so intelligent

00:04:03.455 --> 00:04:06.747
that they would cheat themselves with their own intelligence.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.455
They will not accept your advice,  whatever it is.

00:04:10.747 --> 00:04:13.288
Try to tell them as far as possible,

00:04:13.497 --> 00:04:15.288
you have to go to a great extent,

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.205
because you are not here for them,

00:04:17.372 --> 00:04:19.580
you are here for yourself and for God.

00:04:19.871 --> 00:04:23.080
So you have no business to waste your energy

00:04:23.372 --> 00:04:27.497
with somebody who is a positively negative person.

00:04:32.413 --> 00:04:35.789
And in that the approach should be such that

00:04:36.121 --> 00:04:38.913
you try to help that person as far as possible.

00:04:39.205 --> 00:04:42.996
Supposing she has some bad habits,

00:04:43.288 --> 00:04:44.705
she's taking drugs, all right,

00:04:44.955 --> 00:04:48.247
try to take out that part, the drug and all that,

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:49.913
try to do whatever is possible.

00:04:50.247 --> 00:04:53.121
Give a bandhan, beat her with shoes

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.121
but your attention should not be

00:04:55.455 --> 00:04:58.622
completely towards one person who's negative.

00:04:58.913 --> 00:05:01.497
Normally in an ashram, I've seen,

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:03.622
mostly one negative person appears

00:05:03.913 --> 00:05:06.497
and the whole ashram gets upset.

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:08.413
It's a very common thing

00:05:08.705 --> 00:05:12.705
because one nasty person can spoil the whole show.

00:05:12.996 --> 00:05:16.372
Like today I had to spend some money
with another nasty person

00:05:16.455 --> 00:05:18.288
just for nothing at all,

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.080
and because she's negative

00:05:20.288 --> 00:05:22.080
I had to fight it out Myself,

00:05:22.288 --> 00:05:24.372
I did not know how others are going to fight it out.

00:05:26.705 --> 00:05:29.497
But you have to tell frankly on the face

00:05:29.705 --> 00:05:31.871
that, "If you want to go to hell you can go,

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.080
if you want to go to God then you should change yourself,

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.913
you have to transform yourself, you have to
be all right."

00:05:40.205 --> 00:05:42.413
Everyone can get cured.

00:05:42.705 --> 00:05:47.330
Lazy lumps are the only difficult things,

00:05:47.622 --> 00:05:49.789
lazy people, because they have excuses.

00:05:50.038 --> 00:05:51.539
They are the most difficult things,

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:55.622
lazy people are the most difficult people I have seen.

00:05:55.913 --> 00:05:58.789
If the person is not a lazy person,

00:05:59.038 --> 00:06:02.205
it's very easy to make him do things.

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:05.038
For a lazy person everything is
difficult

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.413
because he's indulging into laziness.

00:06:08.497 --> 00:06:12.038
But one must remember one principle of Sahaja Yoga

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.871
which is very important.

00:06:14.163 --> 00:06:16.705
I think one should write it down in your heart.

00:06:16.996 --> 00:06:21.789
This is a very important essence of Sahaja Yoga,

00:06:22.121 --> 00:06:26.121
of how to grow, that you should know
how to raise your Kundalini.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.622
You should know how to meditate

00:06:32.913 --> 00:06:35.789
and to find out about your problems,

00:06:36.121 --> 00:06:42.121
your defects and then remove them and raise your Kundalini.

00:06:42.705 --> 00:06:44.913
If you cannot raise your Kundalini

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.413
you cannot improve in Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:49.871 --> 00:06:52.622
Now the Kundalini falls off with many things, as you know,

00:06:52.955 --> 00:06:53.955
if you have defects. Even supposing

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:55.871
you have a weakness for your wife,

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.372
you worry about her, you think about her or your husband,

00:06:59.705 --> 00:07:01.871
who is a negative person,

00:07:01.871 --> 00:07:03.871
the Kundalini will be sucked down.

00:07:04.205 --> 00:07:09.789
It will be sucked down with all these negative attentions,

00:07:10.121 --> 00:07:12.163
any kind of a negative attention you have,

00:07:12.455 --> 00:07:13.747
it will be sucked down.

00:07:32.955 --> 00:07:35.580
And such negative people always push forward,

00:07:35.913 --> 00:07:37.580
they'll sit in front of Me,

00:07:37.913 --> 00:07:40.288
they'll be just there to trouble Me.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.330
They'll never understand that we should be at the back,

00:07:42.539 --> 00:07:43.871
they are very great show-offs.

00:07:44.163 --> 00:07:47.372
They will sit just in front of My eyes, I see them, just

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.372
I put My eyes straightforward and the person

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.455
is straightforward before My eyes.

00:07:51.747 --> 00:07:52.539
Is a sign

00:07:52.747 --> 00:07:56.247
that they are all the time trying to displease the Goddess,

00:07:56.539 --> 00:07:58.038
all the time. Of course

00:07:58.247 --> 00:08:00.163
your Mother is such a funny Goddess

00:08:00.455 --> 00:08:01.871
that She never gets displeased.

00:08:02.163 --> 00:08:04.455
But there so many others who get displeased.

00:08:05.747 --> 00:08:07.747
I wish I had known that,

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.747
I really don't know, I think I'm nothing but forgiveness

00:08:10.996 --> 00:08:13.330
and I just don't recognize it.

00:08:13.664 --> 00:08:15.163
But it's a common point.

00:08:15.372 --> 00:08:21.372
A person who is a very positive person
doesn't come forward much,

00:08:21.664 --> 00:08:25.455
keeps out, doesn't force Me to do things.

00:08:25.747 --> 00:08:26.913
Otherwise they'll force Me,

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.205
"Do this, do this, sit down like this, I'll have this.

00:08:30.497 --> 00:08:33.580
" Unless and until I tell you, you should not.

00:08:33.871 --> 00:08:36.664
Like I know some people, it's a headache to be with them

00:08:36.996 --> 00:08:37.747
where they'll ask,

00:08:38.038 --> 00:08:41.038
"Should I give you tea, should I bring this for you?"

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.163
Why? I'll tell you if I need it.

00:08:43.455 --> 00:08:46.080
"Will you take this, will you take that,

00:08:46.372 --> 00:08:47.622
would you have this,

00:08:47.913 --> 00:08:50.622
would you like a white tea or a black tea or a yellow tea."

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:57.330
I've no time to think about all these nonsensical things.

00:09:00.913 --> 00:09:04.539
And that's what distracts My attention from them and

00:09:04.871 --> 00:09:08.580
they don't get -it's a vicious circle
-they don't get My blessings.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.955
Linda, you are the one, now go on that side,

00:09:12.247 --> 00:09:14.664
you know that very well and you are the one who'll sit in front.

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:17.413
Now I can tell you how many who are sitting in front of Me,

00:09:17.705 --> 00:09:20.413
most of them would be negative people, except for Alexandra,

00:09:20.622 --> 00:09:25.038
I can see that. Another is Martine. Is she there?

00:09:25.121 --> 00:09:27.664
Martine catches very well, yes, second one must be Martine,

00:09:27.871 --> 00:09:30.747
yes, come along. Martine catches very much.

00:09:31.038 --> 00:09:33.664
And you people don't want to see that you catch,

00:09:33.955 --> 00:09:36.871
you people don't want to see that you catch

00:09:37.163 --> 00:09:40.580
and then what happens that it affects the other person.

00:09:42.247 --> 00:09:44.539
The leaders are affected.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:51.038
Who is next? Now who is next, let's see.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.830
Behind her, she has eye trouble, she has a problem,

00:09:54.038 --> 00:09:56.539
she should not sit in front, she should be on the side.

00:09:59.705 --> 00:10:00.205
It's all right.

00:10:00.497 --> 00:10:02.121
I need not worry that far

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.205
but still, let her sit on the side.

00:10:12.539 --> 00:10:15.330
I've just pointed it out to you

00:10:15.622 --> 00:10:20.705
that you can make out a negative person who has problems.

00:10:20.996 --> 00:10:22.622
First of all, complaining type:

00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:25.747
Anybody who is complaining of nature is negative,

00:10:26.539 --> 00:10:28.330
anybody who complains is negative.

00:10:28.622 --> 00:10:30.038
I never complain, do I?

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.830
Did I ever complain.

00:10:32.038 --> 00:10:35.330
I've been to all your programs anywhere,  did I ever complain

00:10:35.622 --> 00:10:37.789
that the bed is not all right?

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.497
Suddenly the other day I discovered the bed on I sleep

00:10:41.789 --> 00:10:44.080
is really hard like a rock, really.

00:10:44.372 --> 00:10:46.789
I just suddenly discovered because I sat on it.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.288
But I didn't complain to anyone.

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:50.497
I said, "It's all right."

00:10:50.789 --> 00:10:53.080
Because I'm quite comfortable Myself with it.

00:10:53.372 --> 00:10:55.288
So this is it that shows a person

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:56.996
who's not comfortable within himself

00:10:57.288 --> 00:11:00.996
is still negative and such a person should try to

00:11:01.163 --> 00:11:02.664
keep out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:05.497
That's the best way the person is going to be helped.

00:11:05.789 --> 00:11:07.830
For negative people also you must remember

00:11:08.163 --> 00:11:10.247
you must try to keep out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:10.539 --> 00:11:11.996
Don't try to show off,

00:11:12.288 --> 00:11:14.705
because such a person always wants to come forward.

00:11:14.996 --> 00:11:17.372
Why? Because he'll be blessed,

00:11:18.372 --> 00:11:19.871
because he'll be saved.

00:11:20.996 --> 00:11:24.497
It's a kind of a, like a beggar coming to a rich man,

00:11:26.288 --> 00:11:27.288
but it's not so.

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.288
In Sahaja Yoga it's the other way round,

00:11:29.497 --> 00:11:30.497
everything is just the other way round,

00:11:30.664 --> 00:11:32.288
you can put everything the other way round,

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:33.913
then you'll understand.

00:11:34.205 --> 00:11:36.705
In Sahaja Yoga those who keep

00:11:36.913 --> 00:11:38.705
out of My sight are better blessed.

00:11:42.789 --> 00:11:45.080
Those who do not ask Me questions,

00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:48.288
whether I should have this or that are better blessed.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:53.996
Those who do not claim anything from Me are better blessed.

00:11:54.288 --> 00:11:57.789
Those who do not challenge Me are better blessed.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.996
Miracles happen.

00:12:00.288 --> 00:12:01.789
Like in My passport,

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.080
this has happened before also, I did not know in Australia,

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:10.705
but Mr.Srivastava told Me that My passport has expired

00:12:10.996 --> 00:12:14.413
I must get the validity again sanctioned.

00:12:14.705 --> 00:12:17.372
When I came here, Warren told Me at least three times,

00:12:17.705 --> 00:12:19.330
then I asked Warren, "Should I go

00:12:19.539 --> 00:12:21.247
to Delhi to get it done

00:12:21.413 --> 00:12:23.539
because if I go to Hong Kong how will I do it,

00:12:23.789 --> 00:12:25.372
without a passport?"

00:12:26.705 --> 00:12:28.288
And then I said, "Let's see."

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:29.871
I opened the passport

00:12:30.205 --> 00:12:32.288
- it's already sanctioned till eighty-eight.

00:12:42.789 --> 00:12:46.580
So, you see, for that one has to understand

00:12:47.038 --> 00:12:50.539
that we must know our priorities;

00:12:51.163 --> 00:12:53.455
we must know what is important. For Me

00:12:53.747 --> 00:12:55.413
it was important I have to go to Hong Kong,

00:12:55.705 --> 00:12:58.622
I couldn't find any time when I could go there, at a time

00:12:58.913 --> 00:12:59.789
when it would not be very hot.

00:13:00.288 --> 00:13:03.163
And just it worked out for Me,

00:13:03.455 --> 00:13:07.580
I don't have to go to Delhi first and I'm now ready to go.

00:13:08.871 --> 00:13:10.871
It has happened so many times

00:13:11.205 --> 00:13:14.288
and even if something goes wrong with My passport or

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:15.913
anything because of negative forces,

00:13:16.121 --> 00:13:18.539
I use it for an advantage.

00:13:19.038 --> 00:13:22.038
So even if somebody is a negative person, use it

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:25.622
for a positive thing.

00:13:25.913 --> 00:13:30.038
Now, example: I was going to America

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.622
and I had sent My passport for visa

00:13:35.497 --> 00:13:38.205
and My husband who is so meticulous had taken it.

00:13:38.497 --> 00:13:41.413
And they gave the visa for the last year.

00:13:42.705 --> 00:13:43.996
When I went to the airport

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.996
they said, "What? This is the visa for the last year.

00:13:48.121 --> 00:13:51.622
No, for the one year ahead, one year ahead they had given.

00:13:51.913 --> 00:13:54.205
So they said, "You can go next year, not this year,

00:13:54.455 --> 00:13:55.539
the visa is for next year."

00:13:56.413 --> 00:13:58.205
So I telephoned to My husband,

00:13:58.539 --> 00:14:01.038
it was a Sunday,

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:05.121
he just got out of bed, he ran up and down,

00:14:05.413 --> 00:14:07.413
poor fellow, he said, "How is it I didn't see?"

00:14:07.622 --> 00:14:08.497
I said, "You didn't see.

00:14:08.705 --> 00:14:10.996
What has happened is that you didn't see.

00:14:11.288 --> 00:14:12.622
The fellow who did it was quite,

00:14:12.789 --> 00:14:15.913
quite speedy I think, so he gave Me one year ahead,

00:14:16.205 --> 00:14:17.580
so now better find out."

00:14:17.871 --> 00:14:19.871
I mean, this is what happens to the speedy people.

00:14:20.205 --> 00:14:22.705
They'll give you visa for one year ahead.

00:14:25.288 --> 00:14:27.705
That's another extreme positivity.

00:14:28.996 --> 00:14:32.497
Now, then as a result of his running up and down,

00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:34.871
they all got shattered,
you know the Americans especially felt,

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.871
"Oh God, what a mistake it was."

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.996
So they gave Me visa for five years.

00:14:48.205 --> 00:14:51.080
So instead of feeling unhappy about the negativity

00:14:51.288 --> 00:14:53.205
and making miserable faces

00:14:54.205 --> 00:14:56.871
and making yourself miserable and Me miserable with that,

00:14:57.163 --> 00:15:02.622
best is to laugh it out and use that negativity for your positivity.

00:15:04.121 --> 00:15:04.871
In the beginning only

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.705
it happened that once we were going to Nasik,

00:15:07.996 --> 00:15:11.497
I while going to Nasik ..?...

00:15:11.789 --> 00:15:17.205
while going to Nasik  our car failed

00:15:17.497 --> 00:15:18.288
and everybody said, "Mother,

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.205
your car never fails, how it has failed?"

00:15:20.455 --> 00:15:23.539
I said, "Let it be, it's all right, it's very nice here,

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:26.247
I can look around, I can see around and all that."

00:15:26.539 --> 00:15:29.372
They couldn't understand why I was so relaxed about it.

00:15:29.497 --> 00:15:32.288
So the car failed and it took about one hour.

00:15:32.622 --> 00:15:34.705
Now the people who were sahaja yogis before

00:15:34.913 --> 00:15:36.205
never used to cure anybody,

00:15:36.413 --> 00:15:38.247
never used to look at anyone,

00:15:38.455 --> 00:15:41.038
never used to raise anybody's Kundalini, all very frightened.

00:15:42.038 --> 00:15:43.705
But as I was not there,

00:15:43.996 --> 00:15:46.497
they felt very challenged because there's such a big crowd there,

00:15:46.789 --> 00:15:47.830
they didn't know what to do.

00:15:48.163 --> 00:15:49.664
So they said, "All right, we'll raise your Kundalini."

00:15:50.539 --> 00:15:52.038
That's how they started doing it

00:15:52.247 --> 00:15:54.163
and it's helping now, [we were now,?]

00:15:54.455 --> 00:15:55.038
that you are doing it.

00:15:55.247 --> 00:15:56.580
Otherwise they would not touch it.

00:15:59.038 --> 00:16:00.955
So every disadvantage,

00:16:01.288 --> 00:16:04.580
every negativity is to be used for positivity.

00:16:04.871 --> 00:16:09.163
As I've told you before also an example of a little cell

00:16:09.455 --> 00:16:13.455
going inside the Mother Earth, sees a big boulder there,

00:16:13.705 --> 00:16:17.413
goes round it, [ties?] round it again and again and again

00:16:17.622 --> 00:16:22.121
and uses it for further holding of the tree,

00:16:22.413 --> 00:16:23.830
for the support of the tree.

00:16:25.664 --> 00:16:27.955
That is what is wisdom,

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.080
that is what is wisdom

00:16:33.372 --> 00:16:39.455
and this wisdom comes through meditation,
meditative method.

00:16:39.789 --> 00:16:44.580
So you must everyday meditate and raise your Kundalini,

00:16:44.871 --> 00:16:46.996
otherwise you cannot grow by saying,

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:48.247
"Mother, I love you,

00:16:48.539 --> 00:16:53.330
I love you," writing Me ten pages letters,

00:16:53.622 --> 00:16:55.330
which is impossible to read,

00:16:55.413 --> 00:16:58.789
doing all kinds of things like that

00:16:59.121 --> 00:17:01.830
and asking Me questions morning till evening.

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.497
Nothing, nothing is going to help you

00:17:05.789 --> 00:17:08.413
to understand Me or to understand yourself

00:17:08.622 --> 00:17:09.913
or to understand Sahaja Yoga

00:17:10.205 --> 00:17:11.705
or to grow in Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:12.038 --> 00:17:14.913
You may talk, discuss, do what you like,

00:17:15.205 --> 00:17:18.622
to understand Sahaja Yoga best is to keep very happy.

00:17:18.913 --> 00:17:22.705
Happy faces, happiness within yourself,

00:17:22.996 --> 00:17:24.996
joy within yourself,

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:28.330
try to see the essence of joy in everything,

00:17:28.622 --> 00:17:31.205
don't try to criticize, make yourself miserable.

00:17:32.413 --> 00:17:36.121
But to raise your Kundalini

00:17:36.413 --> 00:17:38.913
every morning religiously,

00:17:39.205 --> 00:17:42.413
every morning, every night raise your Kundalini.

00:17:42.747 --> 00:17:47.247
Kundalini is like the nourishment, the nourishment,

00:17:47.539 --> 00:17:53.913
the water of life for the growth of your inner being.

00:17:54.205 --> 00:17:56.038
If you do not meditate,

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.330
if you do not know how to raise your Kundalini,

00:17:58.622 --> 00:18:00.121
you better try to learn it.

00:18:00.455 --> 00:18:03.038
Negative people always avoid that

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:04.830
because then they feel burnings,

00:18:05.121 --> 00:18:07.497
they feel this. Face it up for a while,

00:18:07.497 --> 00:18:10.622
doesn't matter, face it up, clear out yourself

00:18:10.913 --> 00:18:13.539
and see that you raise your own Kundalini.

00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:16.539
Don't blame your husband, don't blame your wife,

00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:19.205
don't blame your children, don't blame your atmosphere,

00:18:19.497 --> 00:18:21.705
nothing of the kind. You can go in the jungles everyday,

00:18:21.996 --> 00:18:23.871
you can go anywhere you want to,

00:18:24.163 --> 00:18:25.580
if you want to do it, you can do it.

00:18:25.871 --> 00:18:29.247
But people must understand that now we are saints,

00:18:29.539 --> 00:18:31.622
and saints have to do that.

00:18:34.913 --> 00:18:36.996
You'll be surprised if you start meditating,

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:39.705
most of your problems will disappear

00:18:39.996 --> 00:18:44.705
because all physical problems will be looked after by God.

00:18:44.996 --> 00:18:47.330
All material problems will be looked after.

00:18:47.622 --> 00:18:50.913
All other problems, family problems will be looked after.

00:18:51.205 --> 00:18:56.121
But the main problem is how to make you do it.

00:18:56.413 --> 00:19:02.497
It's like once you eat your food
your tongue can taste it,

00:19:02.747 --> 00:19:05.622
it gets the saliva, it goes down,

00:19:05.913 --> 00:19:06.913
it's all looked after,

00:19:07.121 --> 00:19:09.497
it goes down properly, down below it is all

00:19:09.789 --> 00:19:11.789
the juices are secreted,

00:19:11.913 --> 00:19:13.996
they know that the food is coming,

00:19:14.288 --> 00:19:18.497
it is digested in different parts, as it is, it is all built-in.

00:19:18.497 --> 00:19:20.580
But you must put it in the mouth,

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:28.372
and this is what is the mechanism of Sahaja Yoga is

00:19:28.455 --> 00:19:33.080
that you must meditate and raise your Kundalini.

00:19:33.288 --> 00:19:36.871
In so many ways, in so many styles, in so many angles

00:19:37.205 --> 00:19:39.996
I have said this again and again and again and again.

00:19:42.205 --> 00:19:43.871
But that's what we do not do.

00:19:45.205 --> 00:19:48.372
And know your purpose, you must know your purpose.

00:19:48.705 --> 00:19:49.705
Like as I said

00:19:49.913 --> 00:19:52.913
that  the leaders do not know their importance at all.

00:19:54.205 --> 00:19:57.205
They behave sometimes in a manner which I can't understand.

00:19:58.497 --> 00:20:02.205
They become so silly about their wives, their husbands

00:20:02.539 --> 00:20:03.622
that I cannot understand.

00:20:03.913 --> 00:20:06.205
That's not important at all.

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:09.121
If they're leaders, they have responsibility.

00:20:09.955 --> 00:20:12.955
Secondly, the leaders must tell off

00:20:13.163 --> 00:20:14.580
people who are to be told off,

00:20:14.871 --> 00:20:15.871
it's very important.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.205
If you cannot tell off people, it's no use.

00:20:27.288 --> 00:20:31.372
And that's how the leadership is not going to be respected,

00:20:31.705 --> 00:20:34.580
if you do not tell off people who are negative.

00:20:34.913 --> 00:20:38.413
One negative problem comes in, immediately they'll report it,

00:20:38.705 --> 00:20:40.038
I immediately know this is his wife

00:20:40.247 --> 00:20:41.830
or husband must be doing nonsense there.

00:20:42.121 --> 00:20:43.913
Immediately it is reported,

00:20:44.205 --> 00:20:45.705
"This is happening, that is happening,"

00:20:45.913 --> 00:20:47.705
is a sign of negativity.

00:20:49.413 --> 00:20:53.580
Immediately you can solve the problem, give bandhans.

00:20:56.955 --> 00:21:00.580
The simplest way is to sit before My photograph

00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:03.205
and just say, "Mother, please this is the problem," finished.

00:21:04.497 --> 00:21:06.455
There's no need to take a telephone and

00:21:06.747 --> 00:21:09.163
telephone to Me at about two o'clock in the night.

00:21:11.455 --> 00:21:14.871
Just do that, but the trouble is you cannot

00:21:15.163 --> 00:21:18.080
because your system is not yet reached that point.

00:21:19.413 --> 00:21:20.497
It's such a vicious circle.

00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:23.288
Your system must reach that point

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.705
where the connection is absolutely there,

00:21:25.955 --> 00:21:27.996
you don't care for leadership, anything,

00:21:28.288 --> 00:21:30.539
but you care for your inner growth.

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:34.121
If your inner growth is in that position

00:21:34.121 --> 00:21:36.705
it will happen automatically.

00:21:41.539 --> 00:21:43.789
This is what it is, very difficult

00:21:44.121 --> 00:21:48.413
for people to understand that we have to be

00:21:48.747 --> 00:21:51.497
sensibly placed towards ourselves.

00:21:53.497 --> 00:21:56.497
Now about the leaders I would say this about others also,

00:21:56.789 --> 00:22:01.705
that we have to be very, very sensibly

00:22:01.913 --> 00:22:03.622
placed about ourselves.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.580
Are we sensible towards ourselves?

00:22:06.871 --> 00:22:09.288
Some old people behave like children,

00:22:09.622 --> 00:22:11.955
some children behave like old people in the

00:22:12.163 --> 00:22:15.747
sense that start telling off, answering back, misbehaving.

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:19.580
We must know our age, our group,

00:22:19.871 --> 00:22:24.247
everything and behave in a manner that is dignified.

00:22:24.539 --> 00:22:28.247
In a small age also if a child talks like a child,

00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:31.205
he can be very, very positive.

00:22:34.705 --> 00:22:37.996
I must tell you that I've had some very, very funny reports

00:22:38.288 --> 00:22:40.580
about some people which was so shocking

00:22:40.913 --> 00:22:43.705
that how did they arbitrarily behaved.

00:22:44.955 --> 00:22:49.288
And it's only thing that is behind is the sense of leadership.

00:22:49.871 --> 00:22:52.580
I wanted to be leaders, this wanted to be leaders,

00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:53.580
that wanted to be leaders.

00:22:53.955 --> 00:22:57.288
There's nothing like leadership in Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:57.497 --> 00:22:59.789
you don't know your Mother is too capable.

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.789
She doesn't need any leaders, you don't know Her,

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.205
better know Her. She's too capable,

00:23:08.247 --> 00:23:10.455
very clever and cunning woman.

00:23:19.747 --> 00:23:22.247
She's all-powerful

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:24.664
and She knows everything about you,

00:23:24.996 --> 00:23:26.830
She knows how to handle situations.

00:23:27.121 --> 00:23:30.455
She's not going to allow Sahaja Yoga

00:23:30.747 --> 00:23:32.747
disappear because of somebody's stupidity.

00:23:32.955 --> 00:23:33.747
Know that!

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:39.747
Sitting down here I know about everything about everyone.

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:43.413
I may look very simple, it's not so.

00:23:49.413 --> 00:23:52.038
That's why I have to tell you

00:23:52.038 --> 00:23:55.205
that you don't consider yourself

00:23:55.539 --> 00:24:04.622
to be endowed with some sort of a special power as a leader.

00:24:04.913 --> 00:24:11.205
Only that you have the power through your Mother

00:24:11.497 --> 00:24:12.996
which you have to assert.

00:24:13.288 --> 00:24:15.789
So, "Whatever I'm doing is the Mother Who is doing it."

00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:17.996
And when you do that you'll be amazed

00:24:18.288 --> 00:24:21.372
that  whatever you want  will be sensible,

00:24:21.705 --> 00:24:24.372
whatever you'll ask for it will be sensible

00:24:24.705 --> 00:24:27.497
- sensible means which is related to Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:29.789 --> 00:24:31.789
And whatever you do will be sensible.

00:24:32.163 --> 00:24:35.747
All your dignity, everything will pile up together,

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.871
but foremost thing and the most important at

00:24:40.121 --> 00:24:42.539
any cost you must meditate.

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:51.497
This is what I have to now tell to our Indians also

00:24:51.789 --> 00:24:55.080
but for you it is very important

00:24:56.372 --> 00:24:59.205
because now you are returning back to

00:25:00.497 --> 00:25:01.871
"the real place."

00:25:06.205 --> 00:25:10.080
Like yesterday somebody said to Me,  some westerner said,

00:25:10.372 --> 00:25:12.996
"Mother they are talking about why you left Vaikuntha

00:25:13.288 --> 00:25:15.580
and came to this India,

00:25:15.913 --> 00:25:18.913
is all right, but we would say why did you leave this India

00:25:19.205 --> 00:25:20.205
and came to us."

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.705
Then the answer was there that the God

00:25:26.205 --> 00:25:30.497
God has become mad about the saints

00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:31.955
because of the saints

00:25:32.247 --> 00:25:33.455
and their company.

00:25:33.747 --> 00:25:36.622
But the saints have to be saints

00:25:36.955 --> 00:25:38.622
otherwise they become troublesome to Me.

00:25:40.747 --> 00:25:44.121
If I go to lunatic asylum

00:25:44.455 --> 00:25:45.539
nothing will happen to Me.

00:25:47.121 --> 00:25:51.539
If I go to say, to a cemetery, nothing will happen to Me.

00:25:53.163 --> 00:25:56.789
But if a saint catches even a slightest thing,

00:25:57.121 --> 00:25:58.913
that troubles Me, tortures Me,

00:25:59.205 --> 00:26:01.121
not outwardly may be, but inside.

00:26:06.413 --> 00:26:09.413
Because I've given you place in My heart,

00:26:09.789 --> 00:26:12.497
in My being, you circulate in My being.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.913
That is how I know about you.

00:26:18.205 --> 00:26:20.705
So if you really grow better,

00:26:21.038 --> 00:26:23.413
if you improve better

00:26:23.705 --> 00:26:26.121
it will be a thing of joy for you

00:26:26.413 --> 00:26:28.372
and the greatest joy for Me as well,

00:26:28.664 --> 00:26:30.580
that's all I want that you should be,

00:26:30.871 --> 00:26:33.497
nothing else, nothing else.

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:38.789
Now one more assurance I want to give you

00:26:39.121 --> 00:26:44.205
that we are going to start certain projects in India.

00:26:44.455 --> 00:26:46.330
Now the time has come,

00:26:46.622 --> 00:26:49.413
we have acquired some land definitely now

00:26:49.747 --> 00:26:51.747
and we are going to work out

00:26:52.038 --> 00:26:54.955
some projects as soon as I settle down in India,

00:26:55.247 --> 00:26:58.038
we will start showing the manifestation of that.

00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:01.038
And maybe this kind of tour

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:05.830
I may not be able to do after a few years.

00:27:06.121 --> 00:27:09.747
But then you yourself will be able to conduct  these

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.247
tours in your own country, go round

00:27:12.539 --> 00:27:15.413
because this is a training period where you will learn how

00:27:15.747 --> 00:27:17.121
to do this kind of thing.

00:27:17.455 --> 00:27:20.413
Of course in your country it's rather difficult to get such people

00:27:20.747 --> 00:27:24.038
but how to contact: I started with one person.

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:28.121
So I'm just a lady, housewife

00:27:28.413 --> 00:27:30.747
and if I could do it, why not you?

00:27:42.455 --> 00:27:47.288
So now go with a pleasant mind, enjoy yourself.

00:27:49.288 --> 00:27:52.288
It's very difficult for a mother to bear all this because

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:54.996
when I leave India I feel terrible about the Indians,

00:27:55.288 --> 00:27:57.038
when I leave youI feel terrible about you.

00:27:57.330 --> 00:27:58.247
It's something horrible

00:27:58.413 --> 00:28:01.121
that I want that somehow or other we all should have one

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:06.330
huge country of our own where we all settle down happily together.

00:28:18.455 --> 00:28:22.622
So on behalf of you I would like to thank all the Indians

00:28:22.955 --> 00:28:25.455
who have done so much for us,

00:28:25.747 --> 00:28:28.789
given us all the comfort, according to them it was discomfort

00:28:29.121 --> 00:28:30.705
but according to you it was comfort.

00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:52.413
Now you are going on this tour,

00:28:52.705 --> 00:28:53.622
I would request you not to discuss

00:28:53.913 --> 00:28:58.622
other mundane nonsensical things on the way but

00:28:58.913 --> 00:29:00.871
discuss Sahaja Yoga. Understand,

00:29:01.163 --> 00:29:03.789
there are people who are just new, tell them  about Sahaj Yog,

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.038
let them know what is Sahaja Yoga is,

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:09.789
also explain to them what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.622
You'll be travelling now quite a lot

00:29:12.913 --> 00:29:15.247
and also you'll be going to places where

00:29:15.413 --> 00:29:17.038
we are going to have our projects done.

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:20.288
You can have a look at it, will be a good idea

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:24.580
and also you think about what kind of projects

00:29:24.789 --> 00:29:26.789
we can have in this country

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:32.664
which will help them to achieve better results in Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:33.539 --> 00:29:35.955
All these we have to discuss

00:29:36.247 --> 00:29:39.955
and this group is much more serious-type,

00:29:40.121 --> 00:29:43.038
I think, and it's going to work out something seriously.

00:29:43.871 --> 00:29:48.288
About the future plans that we would like to have

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:52.497
here and abroad and whatever are the dates and

00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:56.038
things you would like to do. In the month of May, June, July

00:29:56.247 --> 00:29:58.747
I would be in the West and

00:29:59.038 --> 00:30:01.580
May  I would like to keep for America,

00:30:01.871 --> 00:30:04.580
if possible, at least the second half of May.

00:30:04.871 --> 00:30:07.539
The rest of it you can adjust it the way you want to have

00:30:07.871 --> 00:30:10.955
and also arrange your programs among yourselves

00:30:11.247 --> 00:30:13.163
whichever way you say is all right.

00:30:13.227 --> 00:30:16.399
This time it was desired that I should go to Greece,

00:30:16.522 --> 00:30:19.867
I don't mind, I would like to go there and do the needful.

00:30:31.163 --> 00:30:34.247
I hope all the leaders have got the [chains?]

00:30:34.539 --> 00:30:37.455
I have given to Warren.

00:30:39.548 --> 00:30:40.672
All right, it's done now.

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:45.580
I worry about all little, little things like that.

00:30:46.987 --> 00:30:49.780
..............................Marathi............................

00:30:51.924 --> 00:30:56.258
Now you're all here together.

00:30:56.595 --> 00:31:01.023
And you mixed with them.
They served so much.

00:31:01.562 --> 00:31:06.662
Saints served. All of us
are very grateful to you.

00:31:14.301 --> 00:31:19.102
You worked very hard. we just doesn't
understand how much to thank for that.

00:31:19.605 --> 00:31:23.105
But for you, these people have
Bring some photos and other stuff.

00:31:23.359 --> 00:31:26.359
We will give it to everyone after worship.

00:31:26.604 --> 00:31:28.012
Secondly,

00:31:28.662 --> 00:31:34.912
The songs that were sung or dance
was done in the program yesterday.

00:31:34.912 --> 00:31:37.104
That makes these people are very happy.

00:31:37.104 --> 00:31:42.855
Mataji, thank them in the
Marathi language on our behalf.

00:31:42.855 --> 00:31:45.356
They have said that.

00:31:51.113 --> 00:31:53.505
Especially the university
people have done

00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:56.629
such a beautiful program
with such hard work.

00:31:56.860 --> 00:32:00.107
They really appreciated that.

00:32:00.853 --> 00:32:03.108
The other thing is that

00:32:03.603 --> 00:32:08.104
people and the men of the
university should think of contributing

00:32:08.857 --> 00:32:10.608
a little to my work.

00:32:10.843 --> 00:32:18.756
You know that we went to different
places. we went to Ashtangaon,

00:32:18.856 --> 00:32:20.601
we went to Ganori village.

00:32:20.601 --> 00:32:23.872
We went to Sangamner and

00:32:25.732 --> 00:32:28.982
many people came to Shrirampur too.

00:32:30.602 --> 00:32:35.105
In this place, you people
should divide each other.

00:32:35.472 --> 00:32:37.356
Dhumal work very hard.

00:32:37.443 --> 00:32:41.103
He worked so hard to maintain Sahajyoga.

00:32:41.608 --> 00:32:48.104
This single man took everything
on himself and Spend money for

00:32:48.354 --> 00:32:50.356
the Sahaja yoga. Wisely did it all.

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:57.602
Also, everyone should
take on his responsibilities.

00:32:57.606 --> 00:32:59.354
Because it is the work of the Lord.

00:32:59.575 --> 00:33:04.605
Who had the opportunity to get the
power of the Lord and the work of the Lord

00:33:04.855 --> 00:33:06.443
So without any

00:33:07.912 --> 00:33:12.912
greed for domination or power or money.

00:33:14.105 --> 00:33:19.857
We must do this work
in the greed of the Lord.

00:33:20.103 --> 00:33:25.602
And make all arrangements within
you. Which village will we go to?

00:33:25.602 --> 00:33:27.355
Who will go to which village?

00:33:27.355 --> 00:33:29.672
make all the arrangements.
took a share of each work.

00:33:30.542 --> 00:33:35.857
Now, Mr. Kumbhojkar is here,
I tell him, he should look here.

00:33:35.857 --> 00:33:37.662
and pay attention to everyone.

00:33:37.662 --> 00:33:45.563
Everyone should be given
different places, locations.

00:33:45.857 --> 00:33:51.605
And before that, we went to
Aardgaon, went to Musalwadi,

00:33:52.922 --> 00:33:54.992
And we have gone to so many places.

00:33:54.992 --> 00:34:01.354
Where is Renuka Devi
situated? "Manori". We went there.

00:34:02.762 --> 00:34:05.232
We have been to many places like this.

00:34:05.232 --> 00:34:07.107
The main work is already done.

00:34:07.355 --> 00:34:12.606
But still, there is no
consistency, integrity in this work.

00:34:12.854 --> 00:34:14.607
That you guys can do it .

00:34:15.221 --> 00:34:18.972
One day a week, take time out to set
up your center. Whatever you want to run.

00:34:18.972 --> 00:34:22.856
Wherever you are convinced.
You can take it and go there.

00:34:23.105 --> 00:34:25.604
Ladies should go there
and sing a few songs there.

00:34:25.607 --> 00:34:28.312
Call people. Because of the
hymns(bhajan) lots of people will come.

00:34:28.356 --> 00:34:31.732
If women go and say hymns
(bhajan), many people will be attracted.

00:34:31.732 --> 00:34:33.604
There is a program of
hymns (bhajan). You come

00:34:33.853 --> 00:34:39.859
Even if you go once a week, it
will be like doing a lot of work.

00:34:40.106 --> 00:34:42.356
Different tasks should be
divided among yourselves.

00:34:43.602 --> 00:34:45.106
There are two parts to Sahaja yoga.

00:34:45.442 --> 00:34:48.194
first, you should raise
your kundalini from Inside.

00:34:48.359 --> 00:34:49.855
Kundalini should be picked up.

00:34:50.106 --> 00:34:51.853
Meditation should be done for this.

00:34:51.853 --> 00:34:53.357
But what to do with a lamp?

00:34:53.357 --> 00:34:57.355
If you put a lamp and put it in
the distance, what is the benefit?

00:34:58.082 --> 00:35:01.604
Christ has clearly said that no one lights
a lamp and puts it down in Lighthouse.

00:35:02.111 --> 00:35:04.552
So they put it on top.
they do not keep it down.

00:35:05.607 --> 00:35:09.102
And it is a lamp that light up
by the Lord has given to you.

00:35:09.603 --> 00:35:12.102
You should give light to others.

00:35:12.106 --> 00:35:18.104
And only when you enlighten
others, you will find true happiness.

00:35:18.353 --> 00:35:20.606
And that is a circle of joy.

00:35:21.855 --> 00:35:25.106
Now if I had explained to you in the
example as nature, you would remember.

00:35:25.352 --> 00:35:27.358
There is a circle in Nature.

00:35:27.605 --> 00:35:29.609
Suppose you now sow a seed.

00:35:29.855 --> 00:35:31.854
Now that your farm is ready.

00:35:32.858 --> 00:35:38.927
Then the leaves of the tree falls.

00:35:40.044 --> 00:35:42.354
Why it Because it contains nitrogen.

00:35:42.852 --> 00:35:45.856
That nitrogen must go back into the cosmos.

00:35:46.881 --> 00:35:50.359
Well, why did the leaves
of the tree fall back again?

00:35:50.851 --> 00:35:55.032
Because in winter the sunlight
is less. that's why they fall.

00:35:55.872 --> 00:36:01.103
And after the leaves fall, the
sun also warms the earth well.

00:36:02.356 --> 00:36:06.944
Next to these are the lands
that are decomposed by

00:36:06.969 --> 00:36:11.377
nitrogen of fallen leaves.
They regain fertility.

00:36:12.103 --> 00:36:16.852
They get Fertile. so you
Can cultivate well in him.

00:36:20.002 --> 00:36:25.105
Same in Sahajayoga, you
have stored energy in yourself.

00:36:25.608 --> 00:36:29.108
And increased your power.
Now there is power in you.

00:36:29.108 --> 00:36:33.107
that power makes you better person.

00:36:33.462 --> 00:36:37.857
Your habits are gone. You
have become your own captain.

00:36:38.852 --> 00:36:45.832
After that, if we give it to others
then what we have given, we get back.

00:36:46.608 --> 00:36:51.853
As the clouds rise from the sea and
go up to the sky, why they work so hard?

00:36:52.856 --> 00:36:55.103
So they give water to the whole world.

00:36:55.103 --> 00:36:58.354
And then they are transported
back to the sea by the river.

00:36:59.312 --> 00:37:04.356
It is so. Whatever you give to
others, you will get it back just as good.

00:37:04.932 --> 00:37:09.355
And the joy of it, to see it.
that view, is your personality.

00:37:09.355 --> 00:37:11.857
Your personality is seen in what you do.

00:37:12.108 --> 00:37:13.354
What have you done?

00:37:13.922 --> 00:37:16.851
How do you see it?
It's like a mirror of yours.

00:37:17.322 --> 00:37:21.356
It is the mirror of your life.
That shows what you did outside.

00:37:21.691 --> 00:37:24.105
But the key is wisdom.

00:37:24.354 --> 00:37:25.853
I am somewhat polite.

00:37:26.062 --> 00:37:31.606
I can do something irritating. I can say
anything. Or I have an Eloquent speech on

00:37:32.605 --> 00:37:38.356
something special. Or I have a lot of
wisdom. Or I'm having something too much.

00:37:38.356 --> 00:37:39.858
I'm an artist. There is nothing

00:37:39.858 --> 00:37:41.603
will happen if you
have thought like this.

00:37:41.603 --> 00:37:44.607
I'm just a Sahaja yogi. I
doing work for the lord.

00:37:44.856 --> 00:37:46.360
I have no time to do other things.

00:37:46.792 --> 00:37:48.358
I just doing work for the lord.

00:37:48.693 --> 00:37:50.609
This is the work of
the Lord that I'm doing.

00:37:50.609 --> 00:37:52.103
That is the most important Work.

00:37:52.103 --> 00:37:53.853
Beyond that, nothing matters.

00:37:53.883 --> 00:37:57.359
If you decide to stay in this
Thought. And with that understanding,

00:37:57.359 --> 00:38:00.856
you try to make a picture
of yourself! It must be good.

00:38:00.856 --> 00:38:02.101
There will be no flaws.

00:38:02.402 --> 00:38:03.854
Keep looking at yourself.

00:38:04.053 --> 00:38:06.606
What do we see in the mirror?
That our body is clean or not.

00:38:07.022 --> 00:38:10.105
just like that always look
yourself. to see everything is fine.

00:38:11.245 --> 00:38:12.643
Have we done any mistakes?

00:38:12.643 --> 00:38:14.608
Have we done some selfishness?

00:38:14.612 --> 00:38:16.852
Have we done something wrong?

00:38:16.852 --> 00:38:20.605
We can't get Sahaja yoga.
if we have double standards.

00:38:39.742 --> 00:38:41.103
Then must-have some courage.

00:38:42.104 --> 00:38:43.862
Must work a little harder.

00:38:44.111 --> 00:38:49.105
And it should be noted that
no one has such a privilege.

00:38:50.104 --> 00:38:55.358
Do the Lord's work, gain
the power of the Lord,

00:38:55.823 --> 00:38:59.222
and live happily in the
kingdom of the Lord.

00:38:59.222 --> 00:39:01.107
Never found all three things like that.

00:39:01.852 --> 00:39:05.106
People ask three things to the Lord.

00:39:10.109 --> 00:39:15.609
Samipya , that is, to be close to you.

00:39:16.804 --> 00:39:21.105
Saalokya, that is, you see.

00:39:25.571 --> 00:39:28.856
and Sanidhya you should be with me.

00:39:32.413 --> 00:39:35.605
Since we arrived you found all these three.

00:39:36.109 --> 00:39:37.356
Happen automatically.

00:39:37.356 --> 00:39:40.358
But we have given you the fourth thing.

00:39:41.352 --> 00:39:44.854
We have given you a
very important fourth thing.

00:39:45.055 --> 00:39:48.854
That is Tadatmya.

00:39:49.859 --> 00:39:52.855
We have put you in our hearts.

00:39:53.144 --> 00:39:55.947
Some Sahaja yogis are so
good, that even if their thoughts

00:39:55.972 --> 00:39:58.893
come up, I feel like I am
swimming in the ocean of happiness.

00:40:01.412 --> 00:40:05.608
And there are some Sahaja yogis.
that I Don't want to think about them.

00:40:09.002 --> 00:40:12.252
So all four of these things
you got in Sahaja yoga.

00:40:12.252 --> 00:40:15.103
Which not everyone has got.

00:40:16.023 --> 00:40:21.358
Someone got Saalokya, Someone
got Samipya, Someone got Sanidhya.

00:40:23.358 --> 00:40:27.102
But very few people have
tadatmya.and those who have tadatmya,

00:40:27.102 --> 00:40:29.106
not got the first three things.

00:40:29.106 --> 00:40:31.853
Just got tadatmya.

00:40:32.606 --> 00:40:34.610
They never saw the Lord.

00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:39.104
They Never came close to the
lord. or Lord never with them.

00:40:39.104 --> 00:40:42.772
Only they had getting
everything in Tadatmya.

00:40:42.772 --> 00:40:45.531
But now after you've got it all,

00:40:47.242 --> 00:40:49.605
You have to improve a lot.

00:40:50.102 --> 00:40:53.212
But the thing with them, they had been

00:40:53.212 --> 00:40:55.763
searching for the Lord
for thousands of years.

00:40:56.107 --> 00:41:01.609
There is Sukrit and also Your virtue
must be there. Without it, it would not be.

00:41:01.852 --> 00:41:04.858
But in this birth, we should be virtuous.

00:41:06.972 --> 00:41:12.110
It is true that we are troubled by the
karma that we did in our previous lives.

00:41:13.093 --> 00:41:17.106
If we had behaved well in the previous
lives, we would not have suffered so much.

00:41:17.462 --> 00:41:19.579
But now if I do more
foolishness in this birth,

00:41:19.604 --> 00:41:21.606
then what is going to
happen in the next life

00:41:21.606 --> 00:41:24.205
even after giving so much
power by Aadishakti,

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:26.858
I do not see the picture of
what is going to happen

00:41:26.858 --> 00:41:29.103
in the next life. I don't see

00:41:29.103 --> 00:41:30.922
the picture. Because it is so fragile.

00:41:30.922 --> 00:41:31.922
What will happen?

00:41:32.572 --> 00:41:35.572
Because it never happened.The
Lord never gave that much.

00:41:36.042 --> 00:41:39.095
No one has ever gotten that
much. Even if you behave like

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:42.066
this way, I don't understand the
picture of what will happen.

00:41:42.564 --> 00:41:44.104
I can't remember this.

00:41:44.104 --> 00:41:48.605
how to look? Because it never happened.

00:41:54.523 --> 00:41:57.609
And so it is very much needed.

00:41:57.609 --> 00:42:02.106
You have to see clearly
and lean in Sahaja yoga.

00:42:02.416 --> 00:42:04.083
Especially the ego veil.

00:42:05.252 --> 00:42:07.955
These people are more educated,

00:42:08.619 --> 00:42:12.497
more wealthy, dutiful than you are.

00:42:14.353 --> 00:42:16.165
They understand,

00:42:17.204 --> 00:42:21.602
but you don't, because intellect
There is no intensity. No accuracy.

00:42:21.673 --> 00:42:23.881
Must have pure intelligence.
Wisdom must be pure.

00:42:23.881 --> 00:42:26.022
Why does intelligence go upside down?
because she is

00:42:26.022 --> 00:42:27.523
not clean.Want of pure wisdom.

00:42:27.753 --> 00:42:32.599
Once you get down to pure wisdom
you will notice, why do I do this?

00:42:33.147 --> 00:42:34.154
Why do I not think so?

00:42:34.186 --> 00:42:36.732
Why am I not okay?

00:42:37.396 --> 00:42:40.331
It will feel like that and then you
will immediately have that power.

00:42:41.602 --> 00:42:45.413
And you better yourself.

00:42:47.718 --> 00:42:51.145
There are many rules of Sahaja
yoga. They are very simple. Nothing

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:54.750
difficult. You don't have to do
anything special. You must obey them.

00:42:54.953 --> 00:43:01.186
But most importantly, what we call
passion, the persistence behind anything.

00:43:01.929 --> 00:43:06.499
But in a word of perseverance,
it seems like a little trouble.

00:43:06.702 --> 00:43:09.992
But the word Lagna is so
beautiful that it has begun.

00:43:13.577 --> 00:43:15.774
So we need to keep clean.

00:43:15.972 --> 00:43:17.472
You should meditate daily.

00:43:17.472 --> 00:43:20.520
When we meditated today,
what did we give to others?

00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:24.102
The Lord gave this fruit of
happiness, what did we give to another?

00:43:24.181 --> 00:43:25.648
That should be considered.

00:43:28.156 --> 00:43:31.690
Great monks and saints, no one was rich.

00:43:33.614 --> 00:43:36.338
Only their avatar is big, but nothing else.

00:43:36.702 --> 00:43:39.043
Monks and saints did not have a big money.

00:43:39.854 --> 00:43:42.322
But everyone has made a lot of donations

00:43:44.043 --> 00:43:46.043
and they haven't asked
for anything from God.

00:43:46.844 --> 00:43:48.736
Also you should.

00:43:49.165 --> 00:43:52.779
A little hard work for body, a
little trouble, something happened.

00:43:52.804 --> 00:43:56.662
What's the matter? We are doing God's work.
People have suffered a lot for God's work?

00:43:57.947 --> 00:44:00.999
and you know all, you understand
everything. but still, if you do

00:44:01.175 --> 00:44:03.975
not do this, I do not understand
what is going to happen with you.

00:44:04.017 --> 00:44:06.350
I can't even imagine what will happen.

00:44:06.354 --> 00:44:09.109
I mean it looks like
it's going to be terrible.

00:44:09.643 --> 00:44:12.026
So please keep this in mind,

00:44:12.231 --> 00:44:15.853
Meditation-retention is
something to do daily, get the kids

00:44:15.878 --> 00:44:19.318
to do it, and make
self-improvement and stay in the path.

00:44:19.601 --> 00:44:24.169
In Sahaja yoga, we do not consider
caste, religion as any distinction.

00:44:24.404 --> 00:44:27.694
Therefore, no religion,
caste or religion is allowed.

00:44:27.821 --> 00:44:30.803
If you give in, that's the
wrong thing. Not at all.

00:44:31.022 --> 00:44:34.001
Okay now. If you want your daughter
to get married in your caste do it

00:44:34.026 --> 00:44:37.243
but if marriage not happened in
your cast you can do it in another cast.

00:44:37.243 --> 00:44:41.947
Your caste is not external but your
thoughts on it should be broadened.

00:44:42.006 --> 00:44:45.231
We have fallen in love with the world.
We have come into the world religion.

00:44:45.231 --> 00:44:50.864
If our thoughts are not so powerful,
then no human being can do Sahaja yoga.

00:44:50.965 --> 00:44:55.115
How many years ago Agarkar,
Tilak had proposed this idea before us.

00:44:55.369 --> 00:44:59.050
But today this is going
to happen in Sahaja yoga.

00:45:00.843 --> 00:45:06.647
We can fix all the social things in
our country, political things as well as

00:45:06.657 --> 00:45:10.341
our financial things. If your
thoughts become overwhelming.

00:45:10.341 --> 00:45:11.841
So we are really great.

00:45:13.609 --> 00:45:16.518
Look at the kids,

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:20.747
Discipline children.

00:45:21.148 --> 00:45:24.823
Should look at the discipline of the
child. How not to behave, how to act.

00:45:40.396 --> 00:45:41.605
Yet they did not come.

00:45:45.672 --> 00:45:48.604
I have told you a hundred times
that you should not wait for your wife.

00:45:50.825 --> 00:45:55.857
And you are the leader and the leader
must understand the importance of himself.

00:45:58.904 --> 00:46:00.591
Everyone should take lessons.

00:46:30.779 --> 00:46:32.903
Come on. We are tired of waiting for you.

00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:36.175
and bakare why didn't you
come early? What is your

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:38.524
significance? There will be
You have waited for your wife.

00:46:38.772 --> 00:46:40.121
Both of you should come early.

00:46:40.121 --> 00:46:42.523
Shivlekar told you to come
soon. So why don't you come?

00:46:47.364 --> 00:46:49.439
the wife can come later.

00:46:50.955 --> 00:46:54.017
I do not mean to torture
or harass your wife.

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:59.189
But wherever needed, you have
to come. do work at work hours.

00:47:03.222 --> 00:47:05.328
The wife should understand,

00:47:05.641 --> 00:47:09.265
But these wives are very wrong. they
argue with the husband in everything.

00:47:09.703 --> 00:47:11.312
The wife from here is wrong.

00:47:11.453 --> 00:47:13.953
This is due to the severity. You may be

00:47:13.978 --> 00:47:17.039
surprised, I never call
my husband in the office.

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:19.355
I Never used his car.

00:47:19.610 --> 00:47:22.178
I never tell his secretary to do any job.

00:47:22.241 --> 00:47:24.756
This is the record so far.

00:47:27.475 --> 00:47:29.342
You ask him.

00:47:30.991 --> 00:47:37.359
Once we just went to Australia
and I wanted to go to Germany,

00:47:37.615 --> 00:47:39.993
Who is the ambassador
there? That's what I asked.

00:47:39.993 --> 00:47:42.583
And said, 'Do you know him?'

00:47:42.771 --> 00:47:47.104
I called him for this. So he
climbed the steps and came up.

00:47:47.458 --> 00:47:48.973
Didn't even take the escalator.

00:47:49.052 --> 00:47:52.302
For five minutes they were saying,
'Are you all right? What happened to you?

00:47:52.302 --> 00:47:54.702
Did the accident happen? I said, ' just
listen. I'm fine'

00:47:54.702 --> 00:47:57.125
Because I don't call him.
They know I will not call even

00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:59.659
if I die. that's why he thought
there must be some reason.

00:48:01.292 --> 00:48:03.572
As ever, no matter what.

00:48:03.661 --> 00:48:05.796
When they go out they ask
me What do I bring for you?

00:48:05.844 --> 00:48:08.828
I Said, 'Nothing. just Come straight home.'

00:48:08.922 --> 00:48:09.922
I don't want anything.

00:48:10.406 --> 00:48:14.296
Always help with their work.
and anytime you ask him

00:48:14.594 --> 00:48:18.703
I never complain about a single penny.

00:48:20.078 --> 00:48:22.801
That's how marriage life runs.

00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:26.393
Always kept on crying.
this is mine and all.

00:48:26.393 --> 00:48:30.439
Why not this woman come alone?
Who is going to kidnap the them?

00:48:38.145 --> 00:48:40.681
Women force a lot.

00:48:41.155 --> 00:48:44.291
Now it has started in
Maharashtra. I can see.

00:48:45.072 --> 00:48:46.905
There is nothing lacking in coercion.

00:48:46.984 --> 00:48:49.233
They are scared of everything else.

00:48:49.625 --> 00:48:51.358
But they will do whatever they want.

00:48:51.656 --> 00:48:53.546
Very scared from above.

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:57.280
You scare yourself. The rest
of the world is scared of you.

00:49:01.708 --> 00:49:03.641
Never Dominate your husband.

00:49:04.105 --> 00:49:06.301
this is not allowed in Sahaja yoga.

00:49:07.708 --> 00:49:10.102
The woman has her own
place, the man has his own place.

00:49:10.102 --> 00:49:14.813
Rama left Sita, Sita left
Rama, but in his own way.

00:49:15.908 --> 00:49:17.235
She left him.

00:49:17.619 --> 00:49:19.923
But she left him in her own way.

00:49:20.517 --> 00:49:23.329
Not left him in the forest,
but left him in the world

00:49:29.297 --> 00:49:31.359
You don't know your method yet.

00:49:31.391 --> 00:49:34.124
What is the Method of
power, it must be learned.

00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:39.140
It is not at all tempting to
force a husband to just show up.

00:49:42.203 --> 00:49:44.192
That's what I tell girls these days.

00:49:44.192 --> 00:49:46.592
That means there will be no speech again.

00:49:46.592 --> 00:49:50.327
Tell your daughters, too,
don't dominate your husband.

00:49:50.683 --> 00:49:51.796
Should be respected.

00:49:51.827 --> 00:49:55.171
There is a very special way
to make fun of your husband.

00:49:55.265 --> 00:49:58.733
But she does not want to honor
her husband. So that's pretty bad.

00:50:03.593 --> 00:50:08.218
From a husband, you get power in your home.

00:50:08.442 --> 00:50:09.624
Power comes.

00:50:09.765 --> 00:50:13.827
There is prime minister and
there is a deputy minister.

00:50:13.937 --> 00:50:17.952
if deputy minister try to talk in front
of prime minister. that's not good look.

00:50:18.562 --> 00:50:20.171
It happened once.

00:50:20.515 --> 00:50:22.915
Tells you now because it's time.

00:50:23.004 --> 00:50:25.144
Once I was in London. That time Mr. Bajpai

00:50:25.364 --> 00:50:28.801
is Foreign Minister. I don't
know who is Mr. Bajpai.

00:50:29.672 --> 00:50:34.613
They (prime minister) invited
us to dinner, so we went.

00:50:35.254 --> 00:50:37.921
Mr.Morarji Bhai was your prime minister.

00:50:38.411 --> 00:50:40.998
He said that don't give alcohol to anybody

00:50:41.315 --> 00:50:43.814
These people are addicted to
alcohol and must be given alcohol.

00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:46.533
I don't know he is the Foreign Minister.

00:50:46.784 --> 00:50:52.622
I said, "Well, you should
give them alcohol, etc. Well,

00:50:52.622 --> 00:50:54.473
but do they do anything?
If they come to our

00:50:54.498 --> 00:50:56.493
country, do they sit on
the plate and eat dinner?"

00:50:56.909 --> 00:50:59.782
Why did we act like slavery?

00:51:00.165 --> 00:51:06.985
I don't know he is a foreign
minister. saheb stopped me.

00:51:12.499 --> 00:51:14.476
There is your prime minister.

00:51:14.501 --> 00:51:16.116
Who are you to talk like that?

00:51:16.141 --> 00:51:19.750
If your Prime Minister says
so, you should stand with them.

00:51:20.781 --> 00:51:22.812
Why are you stick your nose in this ?

00:51:23.141 --> 00:51:26.343
Even if you are the Foreign
Minister. this same goes to the wife.

00:51:26.469 --> 00:51:30.547
Adornment comes from there.
don't behave Inauspiciously.

00:51:36.209 --> 00:51:37.942
There are many experiences.

00:51:38.115 --> 00:51:41.049
I'm very surprised.

00:51:44.553 --> 00:51:48.990
And there will be ghosts like this. Women
who behave this way will be demonized.

00:51:49.131 --> 00:51:53.178
Ghosts will not go away if
the husband is not honored.

00:51:56.428 --> 00:52:01.089
Well, now we came here
for worship, let's sit down.
