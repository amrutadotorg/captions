00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,480
[FRENCH]

2
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,480
I was just Shri Mataji, explaining a bit the chakras.

3
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,720
So I explained, I explained the different two sides

4
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,720
SM:- Two sides
SY:- The right and left side,

5
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,280
the centers of energy

6
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,280
and that's all I've told.
SM - All right. Thank you.

7
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,280
SY - But we made a beautiful introduction before.

8
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,720
SM - All right.

9
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,680
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

10
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,600
The truth can be realized

11
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,480
if you love someone.

12
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,480
But it should be pure love,

13
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,720
without any lust and greed

14
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,880
which is a Divine love.

15
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,920
Divine love doesn't expect anything.

16
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,480
You cannot sell it,

17
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:35,280
you cannot force it on anyone.

18
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,400
It is the purity

19
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,480
of your being, that starts emitting that love.

20
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,800
For example there's a lamp, which is dirty,

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,800
and even if you put a light inside that

22
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,480
it won't give any light at all.

23
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,520
So the first process that starts in you

24
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,360
of the awakening of the Kundalini

25
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:35,720
gives you the feeling of the All-pervading power

26
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,760
and also gives you a kind of a peace within and a security.

27
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,680
But above all you develop

28
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,480
a new awareness called as collective consciousness.

29
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,080
This new consciousness is where

30
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,680
you can feel another person on your finger tips

31
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,760
and you start emitting yourself

32
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,480
in vibrations of Divine Love.

33
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:32,440
But these vibrations are very dim in the beginning.

34
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,480
The Kundalini comes, again falls down,

35
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,920
again attends to the problems in the being.

36
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,720
The problems could be physical,

37
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,400
could be mental, could be emotional.

38
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:13,720
But the main problem is the spiritual problem

39
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,560
which is very difficult to eradicate.

40
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:29,480
But as you start seeing your own problems and blockades

41
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,800
and feeling on, feeling them on your fingertips,

42
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,600
you yourself correct your own being

43
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,760
as if you have become your own guide and your own master.

44
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,400
In your own light you start seeing what's wrong with you.

45
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,560
I don't have to tell you that this is wrong, that is wrong.

46
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,480
You yourself correct yourself.

47
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,840
When this process starts of cleansing the purity improves within.

48
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:38,360
That is your attention becomes very pure.

49
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,280
When you look at something as I told you yesterday

50
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,320
there's no thought that comes into your mind,

51
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,800
but you become a witness.

52
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,680
But it's not only that.

53
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,120
In collective consciousness

54
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,600
when you look at something, you pay attention to something,

55
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,600
it gets purified.

56
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:29,480
That's why Christ has said "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

57
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:38,360
That means in your eyes there should not be any lust or greed.

58
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,800
When you look at people

59
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,160
then there should not be any lust

60
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,240
or feeling of greed but just you look at them

61
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,320
and the purity of your eyes is purifying them.

62
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:18,480
You all are capable of becoming that kind of a strong personality,

63
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:27,360
the light of Spirit, now enlightened within you.

64
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,840
Spirit first of all gives you the truth,

65
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,920
the absolute,

66
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,760
because the Spirit is absolute.

67
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,640
It gives you the absolute truth into such an extent

68
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:54,640
that even if you have ten children and tie up their eyes

69
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,800
and ask them "What's wrong with this person?"

70
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,360
they will all raise this finger,

71
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,000
means this finger is burning.

72
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:27,920
That means that that person is suffering from guilt.

73
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,480
That means this is the center which is catching, here.

74
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,880
So much is the absoluteness of the truth is.

75
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,960
That means our brain captures the absolute truth.

76
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:05,480
Now, our attention becomes collectively conscious as I told you.

77
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,440
Like we see the television,

78
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,640
the play is going on somewhere in the central place,

79
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,480
and we see the television.

80
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:30,480
So, say I am sitting here and My attention has gone somewhere else

81
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:39,000
to some person, maybe to some problem to anything.

82
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,480
But it's not like television, it's more than that,

83
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,480
because this acts through the subtle of the ether,

84
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,480
that when this attention goes to the other end, it acts.

85
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:17,480
It works, it organizes, it sends information everywhere

86
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,320
and the whole cosmos works it out.

87
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,840
And then the action takes place, instantaneously.

88
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,480
And you are amazed how it works.

89
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,440
You might say it's a miracle

90
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:43,320
but everything that is Divine is miraculous to human beings.

91
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,480
It acts in so many ways.

92
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,960
There was - there are so many stories,

93
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,480
Sahaja Yogis will be able to tell you about the miracles.

94
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,560
So this attention has got vibrations in it.

95
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:18,280
These vibrations are the ones which

96
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,280
themselves are knowledgeable.

97
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,160
They have the knowledge

98
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,680
and they know what to do

99
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,280
and they are connected with the whole.

100
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,880
So the message from them goes into the cosmos

101
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:52,120
and it's such a beautiful, efficient

102
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,160
machine, we can say - it's not a good word though,

103
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,880
of energy that

104
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:06,440
it acts instantaneously in the proper way.

105
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,640
Some people ask Me, "Mother if these powers come into us,

106
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,480
we can use it for wrong things."

107
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:33,480
You cannot. If you try, your vibrations will stop.

108
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,560
If somebody falsely says that

109
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,920
"I am a Sahaja Yogi. I have this power",  is not accepted.

110
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:54,280
He talks about something like that, it is of no avail.

111
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,600
As you cannot force Sahaja Yoga or anyone

112
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,880
you cannot force yourself upon us.

113
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:19,840
And we don't want dishonest hypocritical people.

114
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,800
You have to become the genuine, the pure,

115
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:33,640
otherwise how will you emit these vibrations.

116
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:44,000
You are the one who has to do this new revolution.

117
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:52,040
For any other revolution people had to sacrifice,

118
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,600
had to die, there were massacres

119
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:07,720
but in Sahaja Yoga you are blessed all the time, blessed.

120
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,600
And you have to just count your blessings one by one.

121
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,280
You are all the time blessed,

122
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:25,640
all the time you are given support and help and security.

123
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:37,360
Every moment you have the sensation of tremendous joy

124
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:46,480
and enormous confidence in your righteousness and virtues.

125
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:57,960
But as we are coming from the crowds

126
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:06,480
suddenly we cannot accept, to be on a hill-top watching the crowds.

127
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,840
Because in modern times we live in Hell.

128
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,640
Like our one foot is in the mouth of a crocodile

129
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,920
and here you are pulled into a boat,

130
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,920
but if you want to be on the crocodile, or in the crocodile's mouth,

131
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,760
nobody can help you.

132
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:56,640
If you want to put back your foot into it what can anybody do?

133
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,480
If you like that way, nobody can force you.

134
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:09,360
But once you start enjoying yourself,

135
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,680
enjoying the bliss of Divine

136
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,520
then seldom you want to go back to the crocodile.

137
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:32,680
The conditioning in human beings sometimes can be very strong.

138
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,440
Specially the conditioning of the ego is horrible.

139
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,480
Like to say, "I don't like this, I like this".

140
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,480
or, "I hate this, I love this."

141
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,000
When you say that 'I' where is this 'I?'

142
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,360
You have not known yourself so far.

143
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,360
When you become yourself, you'll never say like that,

144
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:31,840
because you do not react in that manner.

145
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,880
You just watch and see,

146
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:43,280
absorb whatever is good and discard whatever is bad.

147
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,680
But this discretion has to be established.

148
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,280
As there are two energies within us as told by him

149
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,800
on the left and the right,

150
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,840
we have a tendency to go towards the left or towards the right,

151
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,280
and go to the extremes.

152
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:28,840
In France I think is people want to go to the left all the time.

153
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,920
That is they follow people like Egyptians who think of their death

154
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,360
and miserable and unhappy, this that.

155
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:56,320
Such people take to self-destruction.

156
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,280
They do not destroy others

157
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,600
but in self-destruction they can  do things

158
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,000
which they know are bad but will go on doing it.

159
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,280
I don't want to say all of them otherwise

160
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,760
may be half of you might go away.

161
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:39,000
As you know too much drinking, smoking, you know it's bad for you.

162
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,360
You see a person coming out of a pub and fainting

163
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,440
and you want to go in the same pub

164
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,040
to get the same feeling of fainting.

165
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,720
But nobody dare say "Don't drink".

166
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,440
It's sinful.

167
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,560
Now, when you get your Realization I don't have to tell you.

168
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,280
You become so powerful

169
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,480
that you decide for yourself and you never try to destroy yourself.

170
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:31,480
Overnight people have given up drugs,

171
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,760
overnight people have given up bad habits.

172
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:46,320
All kinds of nonsensical habits they have given up

173
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,400
because now they have become the Spirit.

174
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,440
They see themselves

175
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:01,680
The left-side is very dangerous in a way.

176
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:08,480
Beyond the left side resides your subconscious,

177
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:17,480
then resides the subconscious of your previous lives

178
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,720
and beyond that resides the collective subconscious.

179
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,400
Beyond that resides all that is gone out of

180
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,320
the evolutionary process.

181
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:47,360
From there comes the triggering of all these diseases like cancer,

182
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,560
like myelitis - all these muscular disabilities,

183
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,240
muscular dissipation,disability,

184
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,000
then impotency,

185
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,560
AIDS,

186
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,680
madness, lunacy, epilepsy,

187
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,760
all psychosomatic diseases,

188
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,440
all psychological diseases.

189
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,800
That is the psyche on the left-hand side.

190
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:44,960
And a person like Freud, who was a half-baked man,

191
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,800
himself was a complicated person

192
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,840
- he had bad relation with his own mother -

193
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,640
and who died of cancer,

194
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,360
and he practiced on the pathological cases.

195
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,760
Pathos means suffering.

196
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,240
So all left-sided diseases

197
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,000
which are, which were very few in those days,

198
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,360
and he generalized it

199
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:39,720
and he propagated his Freudian theories.

200
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,920
He was given a higher position than that of Christ.

201
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,360
Maybe the Christianity was going on the other side

202
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,360
of putting too much restrictions,

203
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,440
calling human beings "sinners".

204
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,080
Whatever may be the reason

205
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,760
- one side the dogma another side the licentiousness -

206
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,560
both are wrong, both are self-destructive

207
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,600
and they are not going to give you any help.

208
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:40,760
And these two things acted upon the Western people more,

209
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,000
and they got lost into the left side.

210
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,640
To go to the extreme they started taking drugs,

211
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,000
and now the Aids.

212
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:09,880
In Sahaja Yoga what happens that your attention comes to the center.

213
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,000
You come on the parasympathetic nervous system.

214
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,760
You can see like this My attention is supposing,

215
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,520
is going this side and something pushes it upward like that.

216
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,840
So, when the Kundalini rises

217
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,840
She brings your attention collected from everywhere,

218
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,880
brings it upward and pierces through your fontanel bone area.

219
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,640
But also we have very many right-sided people.

220
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,240
They went in other countries and tried to dominate them.

221
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,760
I sometimes say thank God Columbus

222
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,480
did not come to India, otherwise I would not have been here.

223
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,480
He went to America and finished off all of them.

224
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,400
So this is the right-sidedness when we destroy others.

225
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,920
In that we have a kind of a ego ,

226
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,360
we think we are better than others.

227
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,560
This is falsehood.

228
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:56,480
God has not created anybody higher or lower.

229
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:04,800
God created only one world and human beings.

230
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,520
Only according to the climate we are varied -

231
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,680
we are different from each other.

232
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,640
And variety is so important

233
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:24,480
otherwise we'd all would be just the same,

234
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,840
like military regime of human beings,

235
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,480
or maybe like robots.

236
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,680
But He made us so separate and different

237
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,440
because we bring beauty in this world.

238
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,800
That life is interesting.

239
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:05,400
One leaf of a tree is not just the same as another leaf.

240
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,000
Just see the tremendous work of art.

241
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,440
In the same artistic way

242
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,360
He has created human beings in different manners.

243
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,840
But we think we are different,

244
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:36,000
they are different - this is our own conditioning.

245
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:50,480
These are all flowers on one tree.

246
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,720
But we haven't got the sense of collective

247
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,400
that's why we think like that.

248
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,920
We cannot feel the connection with others.

249
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,560
It's like you may form a club.

250
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,720
Like you have club of people who use fork and spoon

251
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,240
in a different manner.

252
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,760
There are all sorts of funny clubs.

253
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,720
We try to club together,

254
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,480
artificially.

255
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:48,440
Whatever is artificially we are doing exists in reality also.

256
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,720
We are part and parcel of one whole.

257
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:03,000
The microcosm belongs to the macrocosm, no doubt,

258
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,480
but it's not the reality with us yet.

259
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,760
It's just an idea.

260
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,560
So under anything you can have a league

261
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:20,480
- like somebody has a "red hair league" -

262
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,800
and then we try to classify them.

263
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:38,000
It's all so artificial and so stupid.

264
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,480
You are part and parcel of the whole

265
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:47,480
and you cannot classify yourself as separate.

266
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:57,600
Like this hand and this hand belongs to this body.

267
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,960
Now if this hand wants to soothe the other hand

268
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,720
is it doing any obligation on this hand?

269
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:22,960
So after Realization you feel who is the other?

270
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:33,480
We don't aggress with our hands our nose, do we?

271
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,880
We don't put our finger into our eyes to aggress it, do we?

272
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,560
Because the eye is whiter than the finger

273
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:52,480
- do we put our finger into it?

274
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,400
All this aggressiveness is that stupid.

275
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:10,520
If you are aggressing each other you are aggressing the whole.

276
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:19,480
Anywhere you try to do that, you harm the other part of the whole.

277
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:27,600
Then we start having organization for the whole-

278
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:32,640
The Whole World International Organization - this and that.

279
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:44,000
But the people inside that, are they collectively conscious?

280
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,560
Is that their inner understanding

281
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:03,400
on their central nervous system that other doesn't exist?

282
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:15,000
So this problem also gets solved after Sahaja Yoga.

283
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:23,960
You forget that you are only a Frenchman and nothing more.

284
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,800
Like a drop falls into the ocean and becomes the ocean

285
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,400
the heart of a Sahaja Yogi becomes so great.

286
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,280
He doesn't see the color of your skin,

287
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,480
color of your hair or your body.

288
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,920
He doesn't see how you sit and talk, what language you know.

289
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:07,480
He just sees "do you know the language of love?",

290
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:16,120
of pure love, of Divine love, of vibrations.

291
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,760
He talks in the terminology of vibrations,

292
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,480
of different centers.

293
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,520
That's what happened to the disciples of Christ,

294
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:36,360
of they started talking in the language of chakras,

295
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,840
and started moving their hands

296
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,400
to raise the Kundalini of other people.

297
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,720
But how this one is also now misused!

298
00:35:54,200 --> 00:36:01,880
They started a religion everywhere where a person gets possessed.

299
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:10,840
Even in Hindu religion we have people going to the temple

300
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,880
and get possessed and saying, "ho, ho, ho", like that

301
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,480
- stupid people.

302
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,800
And they say that Goddess has come in their body.

303
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,480
Mostly they are maid-servants.

304
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,840
That Goddess must have some brains to go into these people

305
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,840
and all the time they go on making gestures

306
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,800
of a such a ridiculous nature.

307
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:59,520
It's not only there, it's happening in all religions.

308
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:06,280
Even among Catholics you find the charisma, charismatic.

309
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,920
Same thing, it is the same thing, it's the possession.

310
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,880
Then the Pentecostals now,

311
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,440
they are going to Guatemala to poor- these poor people,

312
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,400
are getting them possessed.

313
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,880
SY - They are going to?

314
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:29,600
Guatemala to get them possessed - all these Pentecostals

315
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:40,840
and they all becoming abnormal people crying, weeping, so annoying.

316
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,560
They look so miserable.

317
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,520
So it is a mass mesmerism.

318
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,880
Is it religion?

319
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:00,320
They said, "No, we have become like disciples of Christ."

320
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,960
They are not even in their own senses.

321
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,280
We had an interesting thing in India once,

322
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,120
in a village, Indian village.

323
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:17,480
We had a Pentecostal visitor from America.

324
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:29,000
And we have a Pentecostal church in villages.

325
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,280
And they had given a notice to the teachers saying that

326
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,560
"If you don't get the blessings of the Holy Ghost this Sunday

327
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,800
you will have to give up the job".

328
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,800
And the blessing of the Holy Ghost means you go mad.

329
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:03,480
You just go on screaming, shouting, going into gesticulations,

330
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,640
all kinds of funny actions.

331
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:15,720
Now this fellow had no moral courage to act

332
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,280
this teacher, poor thing,

333
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,640
had no moral courage to act like a Holy Ghost's blessing.

334
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:34,120
But he was worried about his job, you see.

335
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:42,000
So, when the sermon was over he got into a big fright,

336
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:49,720
and he caught hold of that American old lady

337
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:56,480
and put her into a round and round and round and round

338
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,480
and saying words in our language,

339
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:05,240
"You see, now you dance my lady, you dance my lady"

340
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:13,480
and the old lady got exhausted and she fainted.

341
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,760
But the surprising thing is

342
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:23,320
that the gentleman got confirmed as a Pentecostal and got his job.

343
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:37,000
All this kind of stupidity brings bad name to God.

344
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,480
This is not God.

345
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:50,760
God makes you a righteous, virtuous, sensible, dignified person.

346
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,520
He gives you a very subtle sense of humor

347
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:07,320
and a very magnetic personality which is very enjoyable.

348
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,520
He doesn't make a fool out of you, He doesn't make you insane

349
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,920
that you land up in a lunatic asylum.

350
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,320
We've got Christ before us.

351
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,280
We've got real gurus

352
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,800
who were real, not these fake ones in the market,

353
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,480
real gurus, whose lives you can see how sensible they were.

354
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,600
How powerful they were,

355
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,560
and what they achieved,

356
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,840
how they loved the world, created peace,

357
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:10,640
how they gave proper laws and regulations to the whole world.

358
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,800
Even sometimes people criticized them

359
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:26,840
but they do not know, what is the essence behind their life.

360
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:34,880
Say for example people say, Mohammad Sahab married so many times.

361
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:41,000
Because at that time they were on war path,

362
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,400
people were killing them and there were hardly young people left

363
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,480
to be married to ladies.

364
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,840
But Mohammad Sahab did not believe in prostitution

365
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:04,440
and extra-marital relationships.

366
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,480
So He said "Whatever it is, you marry".

367
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,720
In America people said "We don't like Mohammad Sahab,

368
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,800
because He insists on marriage,

369
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:35,000
and we want to have an experience of sex before marriage".

370
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,720
I said, "Absurd why do you want to have an experience

371
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,480
before marriage"?

372
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,120
Supposing you have to shift to a house do you say,

373
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:53,960
"I must have an experience of the house before I go there"?

374
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,480
But now the situation is different after

375
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:06,480
AIDS have shown their teeth.

376
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,200
They want now people to have virgin husbands

377
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,440
and virgin wives.

378
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,480
They want to have men and women who are pure.

379
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:37,360
They may not talk about it but they are in a great danger.

380
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,560
And as you know that I'm not afraid of anyone,

381
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,920
and I very frankly told them in the year 1973

382
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,600
that if they don't give up these nonsensical ideas about sex,

383
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,480
they are going to have a horrible disease.

384
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,400
And they got very angry with Me

385
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,400
and nobody would come to Sahaja Yoga

386
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,640
but they wanted to go to all the false gurus,

387
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,400
paying them lots of money.

388
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:24,880
Also they didn't like Me because I said, "You can't pay Me",

389
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:33,240
because I could not satisfy their ego.

390
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,480
But today is different.

391
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:43,960
They realize that I had the real concern for their good.

392
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:55,000
When this Kundalini rises within you

393
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:00,280
then you see the chakra, the red chakra down below

394
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,480
which is called as the Mooladhara,

395
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,760
is the center of your innocence.

396
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,920
Kundalini doesn't go through that.

397
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,400
That chakra is below it.

398
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,400
So one has to understand

399
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:26,480
that to achieve God you don't have to go to sex.

400
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:34,000
There were another type of gurus who came

401
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:39,160
to say you must take to sex, mass sex to go to God.

402
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,440
What happens to the brains of people,

403
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,400
when they hear such stupid ideologies!

404
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,360
If that is the case, all animals must go to Heavens first,

405
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,640
before than human beings.

406
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,040
If this kind of a nonsense is good

407
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,880
then why is it people get into diseases?

408
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:24,480
The another side is that you shouldn't have any sex.

409
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,840
This is absurd.

410
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,280
It's a natural thing which one must have

411
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,200
in a very sane and a healthy manner.

412
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,600
It's like saying you don't eat food at all and you'll go to God.

413
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,840
If you fast then you'll go to God immediately.

414
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,800
I mean there are many people who are fasting

415
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,120
in this world because they haven't got sufficient food.

416
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:06,400
They must have all gone to God immediately.

417
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:18,680
In Ethyopia you have so many people who died of starvation.

418
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,480
Are they gone to God?

419
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:30,480
So (the) another side of it is also another extreme of a nonsense.

420
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:37,440
And both these things have never helped us.

421
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:43,360
Once you are a Spirit

422
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:49,800
you become completely in control of yourself.

423
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,480
No temptations can invade you,

424
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,880
no one can dominate you

425
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:04,160
nor you dominate anyone.

426
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:11,400
You respect the privacy and

427
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:16,200
the liberty of another person as you respect yours.

428
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:30,480
In this we have no sense of privacy and no self-respect.

429
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,400
We have something very private and secret with us,

430
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:44,480
which should not be shared on the street and the roads.

431
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,240
People just want to take advantage

432
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:58,480
and want to make you into an animal or into a sex point.

433
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:12,720
You are a human being above all the creation of the world.

434
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:18,440
You are not animals.

435
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,160
You don't have to learn anything from animals.

436
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:27,480
They have to learn from you if they have to evolve.

437
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:36,640
You must assume your own powers as Spirit

438
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:44,520
and you can see here clearly that the Kundalini rises

439
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:49,480
and without any guidance

440
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:54,760
from anything else but the Mooladhara,

441
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,040
the center of innocence.

442
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:09,800
That's an eternal childhood, the innocence within us,

443
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,160
that's something eternal that does not die.

444
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,000
It may sleep off

445
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:24,480
but is awakened as soon as your Kundalini rises.

446
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:31,800
That is the reason why Christ did not die.

447
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:41,560
Because He is the incarnation of that innocence.

448
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:49,520
And innocence is the first thing that was created

449
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:57,480
and that is the first center in which we have been built.

450
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,240
SY: - Bathed?
SM: - Built.

451
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:07,480
That's our blessing.

452
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:13,480
That's what is the biggest auspicious thing we have.

453
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:24,440
The Kundalini rising itself will give you back your innocence.

454
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:31,520
It will be awakened

455
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:37,560
and you will know what you have so respectable within you.

456
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,840
You will develop your self-respect,

457
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,960
and your security,

458
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:54,480
and all the courage that is needed,

459
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:59,240
through this power of Divine love.

460
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:10,800
You have to know that the subject is too vast

461
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:17,800
and I must have given thousands of lectures

462
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,600
in the West in English language also

463
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,800
and many more in India.

464
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:34,960
So, in these two days I cannot go too far.

465
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:42,680
But when you get your Realization you become the knowledge.

466
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,760
And you become the joy.

467
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:56,760
But one has to understand that it is a collective growth,

468
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,400
like on a tree,

469
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,720
there are many leaves,

470
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,480
and are nourished by the sap of the tree.

471
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:16,440
Supposing one leaf wants to be separated,

472
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:26,360
then a bark develops between the tree and the leaf.

473
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,200
It happens in the autumn,

474
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,480
and the leaf falls off.

475
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:40,480
So you have to keep to the collective to grow together.

476
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:51,280
Many people who get Realization stay away from the collective,

477
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:59,280
and say, "Mother, we love you very much. We had your photograph,

478
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:03,920
we were meditating, still we got cancer."

479
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:13,480
You have to have nourishment all the time.

480
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:20,240
You have to be collective.

481
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:23,400
Firstly, as we don't take money, we don't have

482
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:29,280
very big palatial places for you to come in.

483
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:41,920
We have humble houses where you can come and meet everyone,

484
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:50,440
and become a part and parcel of the whole,

485
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,600
and develop yourself.

486
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,560
You should forget you come from a rich family

487
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,920
or you are a very big personality. Forget all that.

488
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,880
Here you are a yogi.

489
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:18,120
You have entered into the Kingdom of God,

490
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:23,880
and all of you are part and parcel of the whole,

491
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,440
and all these ideas of ego must go.

492
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:39,360
All these ideas that I am something, will disappear.

493
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,760
Then we'll have a new type of humanity

494
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:54,800
which will have no wars, no hatred,

495
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,320
but would be completely bathed

496
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:03,920
in the beauty of bliss, of Divine love.

497
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:12,720
You'll have no problems with your children, with your families

498
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:19,240
and you'll reside into the calmness

499
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:25,800
and the beauty and glory of Divinity.

500
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:32,280
That has to come,

501
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,480
that's, is there already coming.

502
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:40,480
Please, you're invited.

503
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,480
Thank you very much.

504
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,760
Now we have some time

505
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:59,520
and yesterday you asked lots of nice questions, very encouraging.

506
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:04,360
I hope today again you can ask some questions to Me.

507
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,600
Thank you.

508
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,880
-There is a tradition in the Christianity

509
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:30,600
to pray with the chapelet (rosary in French).

510
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:35,000
and is there a connection with the central canal?

511
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,960
So, you want to count?

512
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:43,760
Only once you take the name of God, is sufficient.

513
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,840
Because you are not connected

514
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:56,400
and you are telephoning, you may try. No use.

515
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:24,480
What's he saying?

516
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,360
He can ask like that only. Just ask.

517
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:34,520
[Will mot], it's all right, need not be broadcasted. You just tell.

518
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,880
Just tell, please.

519
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:59,520
He said that everybody has heard a very nice

520
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:02,120
and wonderful message tonight

521
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:08,560
but how can it help somebody who is unemployed?

522
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,280
SM: - Who is?
SY: - Unemployed.

523
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:16,480
and who has finished with this aid.

524
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:19,600
SM: - Finished?
SY: - With the social aid,

525
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:25,000
which is given and which has started to be depressed.

526
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:30,760
All right! Now you get employed by God.

527
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:44,200
Firstly I've seen, in England where unemployment is the maximum

528
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,400
it's difficult to get now any Sahaja Yogi unemployed.

529
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,880
All right.

530
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,600
Because you improve in everything.

531
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:10,960
You improve in your intelligence, improve in your

532
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:16,040
work and in your style, in your technique

533
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:21,320
in every way you improve so much. You become such a dynamic person.

534
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:32,240
But apart from that you want to be unemployed

535
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:36,360
because you want to be employe yourself to God.

536
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:42,480
You want to be unemployed so that you can be employed to God.

537
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:53,440
You feel so happy with it, because you have powers to cure others,

538
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:55,240
to give them Realization.

539
01:02:55,440 --> 01:03:00,360
You don't think about yourself anymore, you think of others.

540
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:12,120
You are no more depressed.

541
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,600
There are so many people

542
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,200
who didn't have the chance to be here yesterday.

543
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:30,440
But they are not here, what to do?

544
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:35,640
You see, it is such a thing that

545
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:40,480
for reality there are very few people.

546
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:48,360
They should be all here to be employed.

547
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:53,600
You better tell them, all of them, if you meet

548
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:57,480
to come next time when I come to Paris,

549
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,800
and can go to our centers.

550
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,800
So many who were unemployed came to our centers

551
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,640
and are perfectly all right.

552
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,600
Yes, please. Yes, please.

553
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,040
Yes, please.

554
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:32,280
Please ask, please. All right, [unclear].

555
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,800
First of all he want to thanks for this wonderful message , and

556
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,960
SM: Thank you very much
SY: add a personal question saying but

557
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:17,800
for somebody who is still on the way

558
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:24,520
and on the road for, to God, how can he

559
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,360
follow the Sahaja Yoga?

560
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:35,600
If you desire it will all be worked out through cosmos.

561
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:45,400
But desire has to be honest.

562
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:51,120
As I told you that vibrations understand everything,

563
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:59,480
they will guide you to the right path.

564
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:07,400
Now, there's a gentleman here. You can speak as it is.

565
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:11,480
Even if you cannot, just talk to him. Yes.

566
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:14,280
It's a question and answer together Shri Mataji.

567
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:17,600
I will repeat it in French because it's very important what he said.

568
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,000
First of all,

569
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:25,000
in the introduction I said that the main major religion

570
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:29,600
introduced fanaticism and his question is

571
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:33,200
that at the origin, base religion,

572
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,000
wasn't a very pure thing?

573
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,120
SM: - Of course.
SY: - At the base.

574
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:40,800
and isn't it the human beings who make

575
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,640
or build this fanaticism?

576
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,480
SM: - Absolutely.

577
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:47,600
I, I will say this as an answer to it.

578
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:51,360
I always say that all these great incarnations

579
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:55,720
and all these prophets were born on the tree of life.

580
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:59,960
They were living things working the living work of God.

581
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,400
But people took away the flowers.

582
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:05,640
Said, "This is mine, this is mine." This is fanaticism.

583
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:09,120
and they are fighting for these dead flowers,

584
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:11,920
even out of one flower they picked up

585
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:17,480
petals by petals and fighting for these dead petals

586
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:10,360
But there's one thing good about all this is fanaticism,

587
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:16,480
that they fight among themselves

588
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:22,320
and you see how useless they are.

589
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:28,760
If there is one God why should they fight?

590
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:37,960
Is very good for you people to see it clearly - it's nonsense.

591
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:47,600
Anything else now? This lady.

592
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:52,720
You stand up now. I think there's no need. Is it [unclear]?

593
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:31,720
What's he say?

594
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,280
What's he say?

595
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:43,000
So he said his question was connected with the question before.

596
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:45,640
If the...

597
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:57,560
So if there are different paths to God

598
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:01,520
in the different religions, isn't it the same also,

599
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:05,920
which is in this [situation, combining the different paths]?

600
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:09,720
But I think that perhaps he thinks too, that everything is the same.

601
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:12,360
You see I answered you in the second way,

602
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:16,480
that if there's a difference, it must create beauty.

603
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:22,360
Variety is to create beauty not ugliness and quarreling.

604
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:35,920
Also you see they were born at a time, say, samayachar,

605
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:39,240
as they call it in Sanskrit language- means at that time,

606
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:43,920
according to time they had to mould things.

607
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:56,960
Now, say at the time of Shri Krishna, He talked of karma,

608
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:01,520
that you'll have to pay for your bad deeds.

609
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:08,480
But at the time of Christ it is no more.

610
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:14,640
It is no more. At the time of Christ, He died for our sins.

611
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,240
So at the time of Mohammad Sahab

612
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:23,920
there's no question of mentioning it.

613
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:31,120
At this time I have to give you Realization

614
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:38,640
and I have to tell you, counsel you all about Kundalini.

615
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:44,480
I have to comfort you.

616
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,560
These are My three jobs.

617
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:52,840
So I'm doing that.

618
01:12:53,480 --> 01:13:00,440
Whatever was in those days, was discussed and told.

619
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:09,880
At the time of Mohammad Sahab there was no smoking,

620
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:15,800
so He did not talk against it.

621
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,600
But at the time of Nanaka,

622
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:24,120
He saw smoking, so He prohibited people smoking,

623
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:31,120
as well as drinking.

624
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:39,800
So the Muslims think there is no harm in smoking.

625
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:47,960
And now, Christ touched the water and it tasted like a grape juice,

626
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:56,880
and grape juice is called as wine in Hebrew language.

627
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:05,360
He didn't make wine, the alcohol.

628
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:10,800
You see, you have to rot it otherwise you cannot make it.

629
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:18,240
Whatever He made was instantaneous.

630
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:22,840
Whatever He made was instantaneous.

631
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:30,840
So how can it be wine? In the wine the fungus has to go in,

632
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:37,920
to spoil your livers.

633
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:44,880
How can He make wine for human beings?

634
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:53,000
So the Christians believe there's no harm in drinking.

635
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,760
We have a church next door.

636
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:00,600
The only activity I see is that the beer barrels are brought

637
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:04,680
and emptied and taken away,

638
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:14,600
and nobody comes to the church on a Sunday.

639
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:19,480
Only on Sunday they don't do this activity.

640
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:23,320
Sunday they don't do this activity.

641
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:31,800
Such a mess of God they have made, you don't know!

642
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:37,920
In every religion.

643
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,480
-I have a simple technical question.

644
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:46,480
I noticed that many people here, put off their shoes,

645
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:50,440
and they look like your disciples or like

646
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:51,640
the Sahaja Yogis.

647
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,560
- Are you an Englishman?

648
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:56,040
- No, I am not Englishman but French language

649
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:57,480
is for me a foreign language.

650
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:00,600
What is your nationality, please?

651
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,920
I'm Lithuanian.

652
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:06,320
I've been to Lithuania, I've been there.

653
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:11,440
I've been, Tallinn I've been.

654
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:16,440
I, I'd like to follow my question,

655
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,280
its not, not, I'd not (unclear) from question.

656
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:22,680
I would like to know if that gesture or other technical,

657
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,080
other form, what is it?

658
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,400
I'll tell you, it's...

659
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:31,120
All right! Everything in Sahaja Yoga has a meaning

660
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:35,840
and everything has some great influence, it is.

661
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:40,640
Now why do we take out our shoes, you see, is a thing.

662
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:52,200
You see,

663
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:00,760
the Mother Earth has a great capacity to suck in our problems.

664
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,520
All the elements have.

665
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:13,960
Yesterday you must have seen so many of you

666
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:19,760
that how from a candle you were getting a cool breeze.

667
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:37,280
Specially the Mother Earth has got the greatest capacity,

668
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:43,240
to take out our lethargy, to take down our negativity.

669
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:50,400
So, when we take out our shoes

670
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:55,280
first of all, the feet are little free.

671
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:01,480
And also the shoes go everywhere

672
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:06,680
so they might be carrying some negativity in it.

673
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:12,800
It has helped a lot,

674
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:18,000
wherever people have taken shoes - it works much faster.

675
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:25,040
That's why we have to take out our shoes.

676
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:27,320
Gradually you will understand that everything

677
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:32,160
that is done in Sahaja Yoga is for your benevolence.

678
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:43,120
Now, put a logic to it.

679
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:49,520
Why should Mother ask to take out our shoes?

680
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:55,160
I am not going to have a sale of your shoes.

681
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:01,240
I am not going to gain by that.

682
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:05,720
So why should She ask?

683
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:09,960
Now, there must be some reason as you say.

684
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:16,120
So you must have that attitude, open attitude of a scientist,

685
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:22,760
"I do not know what it is,

686
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:26,680
but as a scientist I would like to know."

687
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:32,480
Neither you should have blind faith in Me,

688
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:37,280
nor you should have

689
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:42,600
a sort of an adamant view about that "I don't care".

690
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,720
Adamant view that "I don't care".

691
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:52,000
Adamant is - you don't know English - adamant.

692
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:56,200
What's the...? Anybody translate adamant?

693
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:11,960
So, there should not be a denial.

694
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:17,880
Keep your mind open.

695
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:22,640
I'm so happy you are from that country,

696
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:27,400
because in Russia Sahaja Yoga has started officially.

697
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:34,280
And especially in Tallinn I met the Mayoress.

698
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:37,000
she was a, she was a lady who was a Mayor,

699
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:40,400
and she told Me that she wants to come to India

700
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:43,880
because she wants to know the Spirit.

701
01:20:54,400 --> 01:21:01,440
Now I must say I went to Russia and now I know why they denied God.

702
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:14,720
Actually My, as you know My husband is a VIP

703
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:19,800
and they wanted us to go to some place wherever we wanted to.

704
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:31,640
So, we said "We'd like to see some church", because churches

705
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:36,480
still have lot of architecture and beauty.

706
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:49,960
So these Russian officers took us to a church of the Orthodox.

707
01:21:54,760 --> 01:22:00,080
There was this black order orthodox person - the head of it.

708
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:11,880
He received us all right and we were having our lunch

709
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:18,920
and while having the lunch he told us that

710
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:24,960
"These are our fasting days and we do not eat meat".

711
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:33,600
I said "It's all right".

712
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:39,360
So we were having lunch, but this fellow was just drinking,

713
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:48,040
and he was drinking and drinking and we were amazed.

714
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:51,800
Now Me and My husband don't drink at all.

715
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:57,760
So under the protocol, the officers also did not drink.

716
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:05,440
Ultimately in the fasting,

717
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:10,320
the gentleman drank so much that he dropped off.

718
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:20,440
So, these Russian officers said, "Now let's go".

719
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:24,200
And he would not even see us off,

720
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:28,440
I mean he was just dropped down on the table like that.

721
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:33,960
And then officers came out and they said, "With due apologies

722
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:38,480
let us laugh, because we feel like laughing now."

723
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:47,800
So they said, "Now we must tell you the history behind all this".

724
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:55,720
That the Czar of Russia wanted to have a religion.

725
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:01,400
So first he sent for the Catholic church.

726
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:06,040
The Catholic church said that, "See you can drink

727
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:11,480
as much as you like, because Christ made water into wine.

728
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:20,400
Even if you are alcoholic you'll be saved,

729
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:28,360
but you cannot marry again. You can have only one wife."

730
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:36,880
So the Czar said, "That's not possible. We have to have many wives,

731
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:40,640
for our political treaties.

732
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:54,960
So this won't work out".

733
01:24:56,400 --> 01:25:00,360
So they sent for the Islam religion.

734
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:07,880
Islam said, "Marry many as much as you like but you can't drink".

735
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:17,320
They said, "This won't work out with us either".

736
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:21,160
So they asked them, "All right,

737
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:25,600
then we should have some other religion".

738
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:30,000
So they sent for these Orthodox.

739
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:34,840
They are the most unorthodox people.

740
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:42,200
They said, "See, you can marry as many women you like,

741
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:48,040
you can drink as many times as you like.

742
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:53,840
As long as you give us sufficient money it's all right".

743
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:58,040
So they adopted this religion.

744
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:04,920
That's why, is this man a godly person, you see him,

745
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:10,800
the one who didn't even have decency to see you off.

746
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:18,040
How can we believe in God?

747
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:27,480
I said, "Despite all this, God exists". Despite all this God exists.

748
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:32,480
He said, "Yes, if somebody can give us God of that kind,

749
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:37,360
who exists, we'll accept".

750
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:48,000
And Sahaja Yoga is accepted [instead ?], in Russia.

751
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:57,280
This is the reaction to the stupidity of religion.

752
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:01,440
But both are just the same.

753
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:07,440
Whether you accept or don't accept, God exists.

754
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:19,320
He doesn't disappear because of your non-acceptance.

755
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,560
SY: - Madame

756
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:50,280
P: - She would like to ask a question in English.

757
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:53,320
SM: - In?
SY:  - In English because it's easier for her.

758
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:56,480
All right.

759
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:00,280
My question is that, when one achieves

760
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:03,480
Self Realization through Sahaja Yoga,

761
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:10,720
is it a permanent state or can one loose it?

762
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:14,200
Yes, that's a good question.

763
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:17,160
And I had this question when I had the pleasure

764
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:21,720
of hearing You talking, London in April,

765
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:25,920
and at that time I wanted to ask this question,

766
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:28,720
and somehow I couldn't get the opportunity,

767
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:32,280
though I wanted [unclear].

768
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:41,640
You see, as I told you, is the light of your Spirit.

769
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:48,000
It's about the light of your Spirit.

770
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:55,080
So when you enlighten the candle,

771
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:59,720
in the beginning you have to steady it.

772
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:09,120
Once you steady it well - it may take only eight days or a month

773
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:17,760
then there's no problem.

774
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,640
But that part is very important

775
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:27,080
where most of the people fail.

776
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:31,200
First they feel very nice,

777
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:37,600
and then they think, "Oh, it's all right, we'll have it forever".

778
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:45,440
And they go back.

779
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:50,880
But that's why you have to settle into Sahaja Yoga.

780
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:56,200
You have to master it.

781
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:04,360
Don't have to give anything, except little time to yourself.

782
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:12,680
And you have to come to the centers,

783
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:18,600
and enjoy the company of other people.

784
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:39,440
Why sometimes we can feel the vibration very fast

785
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:45,080
and sometimes it's coming very slowly or it's not coming.

786
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:48,720
If you start thinking about them they'll stop.

787
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,600
Shouldn’t think about them.

788
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:53,600
They are there, but you start thinking so you come down,

789
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:57,560
your attention comes down to your thinking.

790
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:14,320
Gradually it grows and steadies itself.

791
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:20,120
Gradually it grows and steadies itself.

792
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:33,400
Now you better get your Realization, you are a powerful person.

793
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:36,400
You'll get your Realization.

794
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:42,320
You are a very powerful person. What country you come from my child?

795
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,200
What country he comes from?

796
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,280
Which one?

797
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:50,720
He's coming from Antilles.

798
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:53,040
Algeria?

799
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:59,520
SM: - What is?
SY: - Antilles, the island near the [unclear].

800
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:01,400
SM: - Near where?

801
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:04,920
The islands near Cuba.

802
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:09,360
Near Cuba?

803
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:12,800
Near Cuba, yes, islands under Cuba.

804
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:16,200
It's good, good.

805
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:20,680
Vibrations are important for everybody.

806
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:24,880
It's good, that's a good area.

807
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:30,720
Yes, what is it, what did you say? Please.

808
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:43,640
He wanted to say that

809
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:48,840
all the priests, even orthodox or Christian are not all alcoholics,

810
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:52,320
and some might drive you to God.

811
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:54,960
They do not.

812
01:32:55,240 --> 01:33:02,320
You see, if it's a real religion of Spirit,

813
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:06,240
nobody drinks,

814
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:12,160
nobody is unrighteous.

815
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:20,560
You are bound by the wisdom of your Spirit.

816
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:25,800
You are bound by the wisdom of your Spirit

817
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:33,960
You see clearly what is a snake and what is a rope.

818
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:42,040
So, you see, that's the sign, even one person

819
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:45,960
who professes to be Sahaja Yogi

820
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:51,440
and does all these things is no more a Sahaja Yogi.

821
01:33:56,840 --> 01:34:01,280
And imagine, imagine a priest,

822
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:11,440
that to the head priest. That means there's no Spirit in his heart

823
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:16,480
shining, no Spirit shining in his heart.

824
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,120
Yes?

825
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:42,280
What's it?

826
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:46,720
Another person who is doing another kind of meditation like TM.

827
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:48,200
SY: - Can she come?
SM: - C.M?

828
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,680
T.M., T.M.

829
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:52,680
- Can she get her Realization?

830
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:57,320
She can, but she has to little bit work it out.

831
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:05,640
Like by mistake,

832
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:08,640
like by mistake instead of coming to this hall

833
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:13,920
we go in the direction of the Bastilles,

834
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:24,320
then you have to take a U turn to come back.

835
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:28,000
That's all.

836
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:32,680
Now...

837
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:52,920
SY:- When we speak about Realization,

838
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:57,240
is there only one time of Realization or are there many?

839
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:59,800
Is there only one way to get it,

840
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,120
or is there a I-way to get it?

841
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:04,400
Only one way.

842
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:09,400
I'm sorry, in that God has not differentiated.

843
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:19,840
That's a living way of sprouting the Kundalini.

844
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:30,120
There's one more. Now, it's endless.

845
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:33,760
Now, we'll ask this lady. And see, we'll finish off

846
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:37,920
because otherwise what about your Realization?

847
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:42,080
Yes, please.

848
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:53,960
SY: - What do you think about Krishnamurti and

849
01:36:54,160 --> 01:36:57,320
about the conditioning, spiritual conditioning.

850
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:59,960
SM: - Who?
P: - About spiritual conditioning

851
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:01,800
SM: - Spiritual what?
P: - Conditioning.

852
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,480
- Conditioning?

853
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:08,640
Krishnamurti has done it.

854
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:14,120
I must say

855
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:18,800
it's better not talk about all this people.

856
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:26,120
All this talking and talking.

857
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:35,480
They have really ruined people.

858
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:42,560
There are many who can talk like him now.

859
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:49,960
They cannot get Realization, they are not realized.

860
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:58,160
We have to be honest

861
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:03,760
and we have to worry about ourselves.

862
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:08,480
Supposing your diamond is lost,

863
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:14,120
and you have searched it everywhere.

864
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:18,680
You have wasted your time,

865
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:22,200
you have conditioned yourself,

866
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:26,720
but the diamond is within.

867
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:30,680
You should find your diamond,

868
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:35,440
you should not be identified by all these things.

869
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:41,640
As a Mother I will just ask one question,

870
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:47,840
"My child what did you find?"

871
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:54,840
Don't listen to tall stories.

872
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:05,920
One, achcha now, one more. You ask now. One.

873
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:50,400
He is a Muslim and he asked,

874
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:53,520
just knowing about Sahaja Yoga tonight,

875
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:57,200
what is Your advice

876
01:39:57,400 --> 01:40:00,960
to Muslim, to Christian, to Jewish because in fact

877
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:04,240
we are coming from the same Adam.

878
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:10,800
Muslims must know that Mohammad Sahab has talked about Kayama.

879
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:19,280
This is the Resurrection time of Kayama today,

880
01:40:21,680 --> 01:40:24,480
- this is Sahaja Yoga,

881
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:28,760
which He's talked about, "your hands will speak".

882
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:34,880
And why they are fighting among themselves?

883
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,400
What about Christians? Christ has said,

884
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:41,600
"I'll send you the Holy Ghost,

885
01:40:43,640 --> 01:40:46,720
who will redeem you,

886
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:50,560
who will redeem

887
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:56,160
and tell you all about it, counsel you, comfort you".

888
01:40:58,080 --> 01:40:59,640
What are the Christians doing?

889
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:03,920
Are they looking out for a Holy Ghost?

890
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:14,440
Hindus are told long, long time, 14000 years back, prophesized

891
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:17,840
that such a time is going to come,

892
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:24,960
that Kundalini will be awakened like this,

893
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:30,160
because they knew about Kundalini

894
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:36,000
and people will be spontaneously cured.

895
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:40,960
And what stupid thing they are doing.

896
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:47,560
Nanak Sahab told about Khalistan

897
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:51,720
to be established.

898
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:55,160
Khalis means pure people.

899
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:59,760
Khaalis means pure.

900
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:06,560
Who are these pure people violent, drinking?

901
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:14,920
We are making the khaalistan here.

902
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:21,600
So what should I talk to these people? They are so conditioned.

903
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:30,280
They don't want to listen.

904
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:46,120
- What is the fundamental difference between

905
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:49,440
Sahaja Yoga and

906
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:51,960
Buddhism by the lamas?

907
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:55,760
Tremendous.

908
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:59,200
Just the opposite.

909
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:07,400
There is no more reality in their ritualism.

910
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:13,000
Their ritualism. Rituals.

911
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:24,960
What Buddha said was that you must get your Self-Realization first.

912
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:33,280
He did not even want to talk of God.

913
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:36,000
For this reason that unless and until

914
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:41,040
you get Realization no use talking of God.

915
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:51,600
Same with Mahavira.

916
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:58,320
So both of them can we call as atheist in a way.

917
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:01,400
Both of them can be called as atheist

918
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:04,880
because they did not talk of God.

919
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:13,920
Because they said, you must first get Realization.

920
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:18,400
Lamas are just the opposite.

921
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:23,000
They have made statues of Buddha,

922
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:28,120
they are worshipping Buddha in a ritual way.

923
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:34,080
They missed the point completely.

924
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:39,040
They are not even connected with Buddha.

925
01:44:40,840 --> 01:44:44,480
He gave three mantras, mantras to chant, three,

926
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:47,920
mantras what is in English I don't know.

927
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:52,720
Three, first is,

928
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:58,040
"Buddham sharnam gachchami",

929
01:44:58,240 --> 01:45:03,800
that means "I surrender myself to the enlightened".

930
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:11,640
Buddha means a realized soul. Buddha means the one who has known,

931
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:14,080
who is known.

932
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:19,960
Zen also means the same.

933
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:25,560
Then the second one He said, "Dhamam sharanam gachchami."

934
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:31,200
That is the Dharma, that is the sustenance within us,

935
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:35,600
the ten valencies which exist within us.

936
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:43,800
That's the human sustenance.

937
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:49,120
And then He says

938
01:45:49,320 --> 01:45:54,840
"Sangham sharnam gachchami", I surrender myself to collectivity.

939
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:04,880
These lamas have accumulated so much money with them.

940
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:12,480
They have got gold goblets to take their beers,

941
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:18,480
and gold plates to eat their food.

942
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:23,360
How can they be near Buddha?

943
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:29,560
Such a person won't take anything from you, nothing.

944
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:45,600
It's done now. Let's have it.

945
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:18,000
Now should we have Realization Madam ?

946
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:24,240
One thing I must say, any amount of questioning and answering

947
01:47:24,440 --> 01:47:27,200
doesn't give you Realization.

948
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:37,400
It's a mental acrobat,

949
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:42,360
and your Realization is beyond that.

950
01:47:44,440 --> 01:47:47,480
Keep your mind open.

951
01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:52,000
I just allow you to ask questions

952
01:47:52,240 --> 01:47:56,720
because when I'm trying to raise your Kundalini

953
01:47:56,920 --> 01:48:00,160
I don't want your attention to go to a question

954
01:48:00,360 --> 01:48:03,440
which is not not needed.

955
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:18,120
But this is no guarantee.

956
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:22,880
May be, may not.

957
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:28,760
It will work, I am sure but still

958
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:32,720
it's not a mental activity.

959
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:43,720
It's a living process.

960
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:48,000
If the seed has to sprout it will sprout.

961
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:57,400
But we cannot force it to be germinated.

962
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:05,400
Whatever acrobats we may put, it may, may not.

963
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:19,080
So we should ask for Realization,

964
01:49:19,640 --> 01:49:22,160
desire for it from our heart.

965
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:29,040
Because that is our property,

966
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:36,640
hidden from us, hidden from us

967
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:41,480
and is in within your reach,

968
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:44,440
is within your reach.

969
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:51,480
I'm just here to give you your key,

970
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:57,360
so you should desire for your Realization.

971
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:04,400
Then Mohammad Sahab has also said you have to become the pir.

972
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:10,160
Pir, Pir. Pir means realized soul.

973
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:21,200
That's what everybody has said

974
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:25,360
and that's what is the essence

975
01:50:27,080 --> 01:50:31,440
of all these real religions.

976
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:41,120
Now, can I request you to take out your shoes

977
01:50:41,320 --> 01:50:45,080
if it is not too much of a trouble?

978
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:55,880
That way French are much humble people, I must say.

979
01:50:59,120 --> 01:51:04,280
All right. Now, those who do not want to meditate

980
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:09,760
and don't want to have their Self-Realization,

981
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:14,680
should leave the hall,

982
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:18,720
to be civil to others,

983
01:51:21,560 --> 01:51:25,560
because we cannot force it on anyone.

984
01:51:27,120 --> 01:51:31,960
It has to work out on people only who desire it.

985
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:39,240
Is in your own freedom you have to ask it.

986
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:48,960
So, I would request you, to leave the hall in case

987
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:53,520
you do not want to have your Realization.

988
01:51:57,400 --> 01:52:01,880
And you all have to, for 10 minutes,

989
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:06,920
little bit co-ordinate with Me.

990
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:17,440
There isn't much to be done

991
01:52:17,640 --> 01:52:20,240
as I told you.

992
01:52:20,680 --> 01:52:25,760
Those who got Realization yesterday will consolidate it.

993
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:35,720
And those who haven't got it, might get it today.

994
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:43,360
Those who have come for the first time also will get Realization.

995
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:51,520
Whether you get it here or not,

996
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:59,800
you must go to our centers to establish it.

997
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:07,640
You have to respect yourself and your Realization.

998
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:13,000
This is very important.

999
01:53:13,200 --> 01:53:16,920
This is where people fail.

1000
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:23,280
You don't have to pay anywhere, anything.

1001
01:53:31,120 --> 01:53:36,320
Now, please put both your feet on the Mother Earth, like this,

1002
01:53:42,160 --> 01:53:46,000
and keep them separate.

1003
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:50,680
Please keep them separate.

1004
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:55,920
Now,

1005
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:04,800
you have to put your left hand towards Me.

1006
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:13,320
You could keep it comfortably on your lap, if you want.

1007
01:54:16,160 --> 01:54:22,400
This represents your desire to get your Realization.

1008
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:29,560
The right hand is for the action.

1009
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:34,440
So we are going to use the right hand,

1010
01:54:34,640 --> 01:54:40,120
for facilitating the Kundalini to rise.

1011
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:46,440
And for that

1012
01:54:46,640 --> 01:54:51,880
you have to just follow what I tell you.

1013
01:54:55,080 --> 01:55:02,280
We are working on the left-hand side of your centers.

1014
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:08,240
So, first of all we put our hand -

1015
01:55:08,440 --> 01:55:11,240
- this I'm telling you what we have to do, but you follow Me -

1016
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:15,280
right hand on the heart.

1017
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:27,520
Now, in the heart is the reflection of God Almighty.

1018
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:32,120
Then we take down our hand

1019
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:37,320
in the upper part of our abdomen, on the left-hand side.

1020
01:55:41,600 --> 01:55:46,720
Here resides the center of our mastery.

1021
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:53,040
All the great masters, prophets who came on this earth

1022
01:55:53,240 --> 01:55:58,360
have established and substantiated this center.

1023
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:09,920
Then we put our hand in the lower portion of our abdomen,

1024
01:56:10,120 --> 01:56:13,960
in the left-hand side.

1025
01:56:18,200 --> 01:56:26,000
Now, this is the center which is for our true knowledge,

1026
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:32,080
to be manifested within us of the Divine power.

1027
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:42,440
Now again we go back

1028
01:56:42,640 --> 01:56:46,840
onto the upper portion of our abdomen, on the left-hand side.

1029
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:56,440
Then we take our right hand again on the heart.

1030
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:05,360
Then we take this right hand in the corner of your neck, here,

1031
01:57:05,560 --> 01:57:10,280
and put your head to your right side.

1032
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:28,040
Turn your head to your right.

1033
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:35,240
This center catches when we are feeling guilty.

1034
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:42,560
Today also most of you are catching this center.

1035
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:48,240
Now, take out this hand

1036
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:54,040
and put it on your forehead across and press it on both the sides.

1037
01:57:59,360 --> 01:58:03,600
So, this is the center of forgiveness,

1038
01:58:05,480 --> 01:58:08,480
the power of forgiveness.

1039
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:13,520
Take this hand on the back of your head

1040
01:58:15,480 --> 01:58:18,520
and put your hand in such a manner

1041
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:23,680
that you can hold your head which is reclining on it.

1042
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:33,040
Now, stretch your hand,

1043
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:45,200
and place the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area

1044
01:58:51,080 --> 01:58:57,520
and push back your fingers.

1045
01:58:58,280 --> 01:59:01,720
Press the scalp

1046
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:08,560
and slowly you move it in a clockwise manner, seven times.

1047
01:59:20,040 --> 01:59:23,760
Now, that's all we have to do.

1048
01:59:23,960 --> 01:59:27,360
But you have to keep your eyes shut.

1049
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:31,640
Both the feet on the ground

1050
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:35,360
and the left hand towards Me like this, little higher,

1051
01:59:36,040 --> 01:59:39,840
little higher like that.

1052
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:46,840
Now, we start off by closing our eyes.

1053
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:52,280
But we are not to open our eyes till I tell you,

1054
01:59:55,480 --> 01:59:59,080
because the attention has to go inside.

1055
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:03,440
Now don't fight with your thoughts,

1056
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:07,800
just leave it alone.

1057
02:00:08,640 --> 02:00:12,160
Kundalini will take charge of everything.

1058
02:00:14,920 --> 02:00:20,520
All right. Now put your right hand on your heart.

1059
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:28,800
And you must put all your worries aside.

1060
02:00:31,640 --> 02:00:33,720
Also you should forgive yourself

1061
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:38,440
and should be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

1062
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:46,520
Now, when your hand is on your heart,

1063
02:00:46,760 --> 02:00:49,680
you have to ask Me a fundamental question.

1064
02:00:49,880 --> 02:00:53,040
If you want, you can call Me Shri Mataji or Mother,

1065
02:00:53,240 --> 02:00:56,120
whatever suits you, and the question is

1066
02:00:56,320 --> 02:01:02,120
"Mother, am I the Spirit?" Ask this question three times.

1067
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:22,480
Ask this question three times.

1068
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:42,920
Now with this another question comes in

1069
02:01:43,120 --> 02:01:47,400
that if you are the Spirit you become your master.

1070
02:01:47,680 --> 02:01:51,440
So put your right hand on the right side,

1071
02:01:51,680 --> 02:01:56,120
on the left side of your abdomen, in the upper part.

1072
02:02:09,160 --> 02:02:12,600
Now, so ask another question here three times,

1073
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:17,040
"Mother, am I my own master?"

1074
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:24,760
Keep your neck straight.

1075
02:02:26,760 --> 02:02:29,320
Please keep your neck straight and sit straight

1076
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:33,120
and do not droop forward or backwards.

1077
02:03:03,400 --> 02:03:10,160
Now put this right hand on the lower part of your abdomen

1078
02:03:12,160 --> 02:03:14,760
- on the left hand side.

1079
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:20,640
Here I cannot cross over your freedom,

1080
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:26,160
so you have to ask.

1081
02:03:27,960 --> 02:03:34,720
Please ask, "Mother, may I have the pure knowledge?"

1082
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:41,920
"Mother, please give me pure knowledge."

1083
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:49,320
Please say this six times because this center has got six petals.

1084
02:04:02,440 --> 02:04:04,720
Now,

1085
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:12,200
the Kundalini starts moving with this asking.

1086
02:04:16,200 --> 02:04:21,960
To facilitate Her movement in the upper centers,

1087
02:04:26,480 --> 02:04:28,960
we have to put our right hand

1088
02:04:29,160 --> 02:04:35,160
in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

1089
02:04:40,080 --> 02:04:43,480
Here you have to say

1090
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:47,440
with full confidence,

1091
02:04:47,640 --> 02:04:52,040
to facilitate the Kundalini to move

1092
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:56,960
in this center of mastery.

1093
02:04:59,440 --> 02:05:05,960
Please say it ten times "Mother, I am my master".

1094
02:05:11,320 --> 02:05:15,600
Say it with full confidence.

1095
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:44,200
Now we have to know that we are the Spirit.

1096
02:05:45,400 --> 02:05:48,880
We are not this body,

1097
02:05:49,080 --> 02:05:54,960
not this ego, not this conditioning,

1098
02:05:55,640 --> 02:06:00,320
but in reality we are the Spirit.

1099
02:06:00,920 --> 02:06:05,520
Now put your right hand on your heart again

1100
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:11,440
and say with full confidence twelve times,

1101
02:06:11,640 --> 02:06:17,560
"Mother, I am the Spirit."

1102
02:06:43,080 --> 02:06:51,080
Now, we have to know also that the Divine is the ocean of

1103
02:06:51,640 --> 02:06:59,640
bliss, grace and compassion.

1104
02:07:05,600 --> 02:07:10,440
But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness.

1105
02:07:13,080 --> 02:07:24,360
And we cannot do any mistake that it cannot engulf it.

1106
02:07:28,240 --> 02:07:32,960
So, please forgive yourself first of all.

1107
02:07:34,120 --> 02:07:41,400
Put your right hand on the left - hand shoulder

1108
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:49,800
and turn your head to your right,

1109
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,880
fully.

1110
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:55,520
Now here you have to say with full confidence,

1111
02:07:55,720 --> 02:08:01,560
"Mother, I am not guilty at all."

1112
02:08:06,160 --> 02:08:10,520
Say it sixteen times

1113
02:08:14,800 --> 02:08:17,400
and if you still feel guilty

1114
02:08:17,600 --> 02:08:23,640
better punish yourself by saying 108 times.

1115
02:08:29,840 --> 02:08:34,840
You have to be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

1116
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:40,080
You are entering into the kingdom of God.

1117
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:07,920
Now, put your hand on your forehead across

1118
02:09:10,080 --> 02:09:13,840
and press it hard.

1119
02:09:14,040 --> 02:09:17,120
Here you have to say,

1120
02:09:17,320 --> 02:09:21,120
"Mother, I forgive everyone."

1121
02:09:23,720 --> 02:09:26,920
On your forehead please.

1122
02:09:27,680 --> 02:09:31,640
They are not putting it. On your forehead, not on your head,

1123
02:09:31,840 --> 02:09:34,920
and press it hard.

1124
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:39,640
Now some may say it's difficult to say,

1125
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:45,760
but whether you forgive or you don't forgive it's a myth.

1126
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:50,080
But if you don't forgive you play into wrong hands,

1127
02:09:50,280 --> 02:09:55,800
so say, "Mother, I forgive everyone", from your heart.

1128
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:10,440
Now take your hand on the back of your head

1129
02:10:10,640 --> 02:10:16,840
and raise, turn your head on it, to rest on it.

1130
02:10:24,280 --> 02:10:28,480
Here for your own satisfaction you can say,

1131
02:10:28,680 --> 02:10:32,560
"Oh Divine, if I have done anything wrong, please forgive me",

1132
02:10:32,760 --> 02:10:34,400
but for your own satisfaction,

1133
02:10:34,600 --> 02:10:38,040
not to feel guilty, not to count your mistakes.

1134
02:10:54,280 --> 02:10:58,840
You have to love yourself, you have to respect yourself.

1135
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:06,040
You have been created into human-being with great difficulties.

1136
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:13,600
Now, stretch your hand, right hand.

1137
02:11:16,440 --> 02:11:22,640
Put the middle of center of your palm, on top of the fontanel bone,

1138
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:31,440
and now press it hard and move it seven times slowly.

1139
02:11:39,320 --> 02:11:46,920
Here also I cannot force you to Self-Realization.

1140
02:11:50,960 --> 02:11:54,280
So you have to ask,

1141
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:59,960
"Mother, please give me my Self-Realization."

1142
02:12:01,560 --> 02:12:04,520
Seven times.

1143
02:12:04,720 --> 02:12:08,680
Press it hard.

1144
02:12:12,520 --> 02:12:16,600
Move it clockwise. They are not moving.

1145
02:12:18,440 --> 02:12:22,520
Seven times. Press it hard.

1146
02:13:03,960 --> 02:13:08,400
Now, take down your hands.

1147
02:13:13,560 --> 02:13:16,800
Open your eyes slowly.

1148
02:13:17,360 --> 02:13:20,160
Put your neck straight

1149
02:13:23,160 --> 02:13:26,880
and see for yourself.

1150
02:13:27,440 --> 02:13:31,760
Now, put your right hand towards Me like this,

1151
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:38,920
and put your left hand on top of your head,

1152
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:49,880
and see if you are feeling the cool breeze.

1153
02:13:55,880 --> 02:14:00,840
Higher.

1154
02:14:01,400 --> 02:14:03,560
Little bit here on the center.

1155
02:14:03,760 --> 02:14:07,720
You can bend your head, would be better.

1156
02:14:15,160 --> 02:14:19,560
Now, put your left hand towards Me,

1157
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:24,880
and see with your right hand.

1158
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:31,640
Here, here, here. Put down your head. It's better to bend it.

1159
02:14:32,600 --> 02:14:36,960
Some people get it very far also, like a jet.

1160
02:14:45,280 --> 02:14:49,440
Now again put your right hand and see. Bend your head.

1161
02:15:00,440 --> 02:15:03,680
Now, raise your both the hands,

1162
02:15:06,800 --> 02:15:08,880
and ask a question,

1163
02:15:09,080 --> 02:15:13,480
"Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

1164
02:15:16,600 --> 02:15:20,480
"Is this the Brahma shakti or the Ruh?"

1165
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:24,560
Or the Ruh.

1166
02:15:25,240 --> 02:15:31,720
"Is this the all-pervading power of God's love?"

1167
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:37,080
Put up your head and ask the question three times.

1168
02:15:43,960 --> 02:15:47,480
Now, please put down your hands.

1169
02:15:53,200 --> 02:15:56,880
Now, those who have felt

1170
02:15:57,080 --> 02:16:02,400
cool breeze on their finger tips or out of their heads,

1171
02:16:04,560 --> 02:16:07,360
or all around them,

1172
02:16:15,600 --> 02:16:20,320
please raise your both the hands.

1173
02:16:29,600 --> 02:16:33,480
It's good, very good, excellent!

1174
02:16:33,680 --> 02:16:36,760
Some people didn't get it.

1175
02:16:37,160 --> 02:16:41,880
Questions should not have been asked so many I think, some of you.

1176
02:16:43,080 --> 02:16:46,400
It's too much of mental activity.

1177
02:16:46,800 --> 02:16:49,560
But it will work out when you come here.

1178
02:16:52,080 --> 02:16:55,480
I'll work it out.

1179
02:16:56,160 --> 02:16:57,960
All right, no more mental, yes.

1180
02:16:58,160 --> 02:17:04,440
Just now, those who want to see Me, can come here.

1181
02:17:17,440 --> 02:17:22,040
She's got her Realization, all right.

1182
02:17:24,760 --> 02:17:28,320
Put there the candle. Put this candle...

1183
02:17:43,560 --> 02:17:45,000
SM: - You had, just now?

1184
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:48,840
P: - Yesterday I felt [big desire] and today [no desire as such].

1185
02:17:49,040 --> 02:17:53,520
There was very, very confusing. Also translation problem is there.

1186
02:17:53,720 --> 02:17:56,920
All right, now all right. So now you don't think about.

1187
02:17:57,120 --> 02:18:00,520
Just, just put your hands towards Me,

1188
02:18:00,720 --> 02:18:03,840
and you just say, "Mother You are thoughtless awareness."

1189
02:18:04,040 --> 02:18:05,880
You just say that.

1190
02:18:21,400 --> 02:18:26,280
I told you, it is beyond. If you have mental activity, it will stop.

1191
02:18:35,520 --> 02:18:37,200
See!

1192
02:18:37,400 --> 02:18:39,440
Better. On the left?

1193
02:18:39,840 --> 02:18:42,440
SM: - On the left?
P:- I'm feeling it in the [bottom] of the hand.

1194
02:18:42,640 --> 02:18:45,360
That's the [bottom] of the hand.

1195
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:49,960
How do I do it to get it up on the head?

1196
02:18:50,160 --> 02:18:51,960
That's why you have to come to the center.

1197
02:18:52,160 --> 02:18:54,360
They'll make you an expert, all right?

1198
02:18:54,560 --> 02:18:59,040
May God bless you! That's happening. Now what about you?

1199
02:19:04,600 --> 02:19:07,760
Just say "Mother come in my head".

1200
02:19:09,600 --> 02:19:12,960
Keep your eyes open.

1201
02:19:27,120 --> 02:19:31,600
Seven times. Say it from your heart.

1202
02:19:37,280 --> 02:19:40,320
What work you do?

1203
02:19:46,480 --> 02:19:48,600
- Academic. Research.

1204
02:19:48,800 --> 02:19:50,680
SM: - In what?
P: - In the university.

1205
02:19:50,880 --> 02:19:53,160
Anthropology. Anthropology.

1206
02:19:53,360 --> 02:19:55,920
Anthropology.

1207
02:19:58,800 --> 02:20:00,320
She should ask the question,

1208
02:20:00,560 --> 02:20:03,600
"Mother, are You the source of the anthropology?"

1209
02:20:03,800 --> 02:20:07,560
Put your left hand here. Left, left.

1210
02:20:08,440 --> 02:20:11,440
This side.

1211
02:20:30,040 --> 02:20:32,080
Better?

1212
02:20:33,600 --> 02:20:37,560
Now you say "You are ", you say "You are", then you'll feel better.

1213
02:20:38,360 --> 02:20:42,040
Say, "You are the source of anthropology."

1214
02:20:42,320 --> 02:20:43,920
SY: - "You are the source."
P: - I ask what?

1215
02:20:44,120 --> 02:20:45,320
SY: - No, you don't ask.

1216
02:20:45,520 --> 02:20:48,640
SM: Now, you state it.

1217
02:20:50,760 --> 02:20:53,560
Then it will work faster.

1218
02:20:54,280 --> 02:20:56,760
That's My place and you, because you doubt Me,

1219
02:20:56,960 --> 02:20:59,720
that's why it doesn't work out there and you need it there.

1220
02:20:59,920 --> 02:21:03,120
You shouldn't doubt.

1221
02:21:06,080 --> 02:21:08,520
She always doubts, she can't stop.

1222
02:21:08,720 --> 02:21:11,240
She says that she always doubts,

1223
02:21:11,440 --> 02:21:13,240
and she can't help, she said.

1224
02:21:13,440 --> 02:21:15,800
So that's it. She's catching here.

1225
02:21:16,080 --> 02:21:17,520
What can I do to [unclear]?

1226
02:21:17,720 --> 02:21:19,760
Just see, "Mother, You are the source", just see that.

1227
02:21:19,960 --> 02:21:23,760
You just say, just say, "You are the source of anthropology".

1228
02:21:24,400 --> 02:21:26,480
So many... Are you all right now?

1229
02:21:26,680 --> 02:21:29,640
How are you feeling?

1230
02:21:34,120 --> 02:21:36,040
SM: - He's looking much better now.
                        SY: - Yes.

1231
02:21:36,240 --> 02:21:38,560
He came at the beginning and he is fine.

1232
02:21:38,760 --> 02:21:41,760
Yesterday night he has been crying a lot.

1233
02:21:42,320 --> 02:21:45,560
That's a, that's a, tears of joy.

1234
02:21:45,960 --> 02:21:48,560
They are tears of joy.

1235
02:21:48,880 --> 02:21:52,080
And he told me that he see it come up

1236
02:21:52,280 --> 02:21:53,560
here on the Agnya.

1237
02:21:53,760 --> 02:21:55,800
Same for yours.

1238
02:21:58,200 --> 02:22:01,000
Thank you very much.

1239
02:22:05,440 --> 02:22:07,440
You felt it? Yes?

1240
02:22:08,440 --> 02:22:11,760
You are all right? [unclear]

1241
02:22:14,760 --> 02:22:16,520
What he's saying?

1242
02:22:16,720 --> 02:22:19,360
I would like You to take this.

1243
02:22:19,560 --> 02:22:22,360
Give vibrations to this...

1244
02:22:23,800 --> 02:22:26,400
SY: - To hold this in your hand.
SM: - I've given you vibrations.

1245
02:22:26,600 --> 02:22:28,880
it will get vibrated itself.

1246
02:22:29,440 --> 02:22:32,040
Now you are vibrated, all right?

1247
02:22:32,240 --> 02:22:34,440
Are you all right?

1248
02:22:35,080 --> 02:22:37,120
Let them say.

1249
02:22:37,320 --> 02:22:40,640
Too much of mental activity, too much.

1250
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:47,160
Better now?

1251
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:50,400
You are feeling the cool breeze.

1252
02:22:50,600 --> 02:22:54,440
I thought that heat is generated inside my head.

1253
02:22:54,960 --> 02:22:57,120
It's getting out or not?

1254
02:22:57,320 --> 02:22:59,760
Yes, therte is activity.

1255
02:22:59,960 --> 02:23:01,680
It will get out. You sit down here.

1256
02:23:01,880 --> 02:23:05,400
You put your right hand towards Me. Too much mental activity.

1257
02:23:06,160 --> 02:23:08,320
Now, who else?

1258
02:23:12,520 --> 02:23:14,440
She feels a lot of heat.

1259
02:23:14,760 --> 02:23:17,000
Yes, see, it will go.

1260
02:23:17,400 --> 02:23:20,520
Heat has to come out of your head

1261
02:23:21,640 --> 02:23:23,840
You yourself you are vibrated madam,

1262
02:23:24,040 --> 02:23:27,280
you don't need any more vibrations.

1263
02:23:31,680 --> 02:23:35,160
You are your Self. You are yourself a Spirit.

1264
02:23:36,080 --> 02:23:38,680
Ha, now better?

1265
02:23:40,840 --> 02:23:43,600
What's she saying?

1266
02:23:46,080 --> 02:23:48,200
You got heat?

1267
02:23:49,800 --> 02:23:52,480
Too much of mental.

1268
02:23:53,440 --> 02:23:55,240
Too much mental activity.

1269
02:23:55,440 --> 02:23:59,080
What's she saying? Yesterday she was all right.

1270
02:24:01,800 --> 02:24:04,760
You were all right yesterday.

1271
02:24:12,360 --> 02:24:15,880
What's the thing? What's the thing?

1272
02:24:16,120 --> 02:24:19,600
She wants to thank You, because You always begin in bowing

1273
02:24:19,800 --> 02:24:22,280
to all the seekers of the truth. And she feels herself

1274
02:24:22,480 --> 02:24:25,280
to be such a seeker so she thanks You to bow at her.

1275
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,240
Your left hand on you hold like that.

1276
02:24:31,680 --> 02:24:33,160
On the liver, on the liver.

1277
02:24:33,360 --> 02:24:36,080
Left hand on the liver, yes, like that.

1278
02:24:36,720 --> 02:24:38,600
That's it. You are all right.

1279
02:24:38,800 --> 02:24:42,600
You are not only a seeker but you've got it.

1280
02:24:48,440 --> 02:24:53,800
And you have to tell everyone about it. Now, are you better?

1281
02:24:56,040 --> 02:24:58,800
She's feeling cooler?

1282
02:25:03,520 --> 02:25:06,480
On the hands, yes.

1283
02:25:07,800 --> 02:25:10,120
SM: -Here?
SY: -On, on the hands.

1284
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:12,120
Good.

1285
02:25:12,360 --> 02:25:14,800
On the head, no?

1286
02:25:16,560 --> 02:25:18,440
And hot on the head.

1287
02:25:18,640 --> 02:25:22,160
Now say that, "Mother, come in my head".

1288
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:25,480
Liver ?

1289
02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:28,240
Come to the center, get your liver all right.

1290
02:25:28,440 --> 02:25:30,840
She is not troubled.

1291
02:25:31,280 --> 02:25:34,440
"Come in my head". Again.

1292
02:25:37,360 --> 02:25:40,320
"Please come in my head".

1293
02:25:45,400 --> 02:25:47,960
Cooling now?

1294
02:25:52,880 --> 02:25:55,680
Good. May God bless you!

1295
02:25:56,640 --> 02:25:59,360
She feels, this lady feels quite...

1296
02:25:59,560 --> 02:26:03,000
She feels quite well in the hands but she feels pain here.

1297
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:05,960
You just say, "Mother, please come in my head".

1298
02:26:06,240 --> 02:26:08,000
Here is the brother of that lady.

1299
02:26:08,200 --> 02:26:10,960
He was ( unclear)

1300
02:26:11,560 --> 02:26:13,840
He is French?

1301
02:26:14,720 --> 02:26:16,800
What's the matter with him?

1302
02:26:17,040 --> 02:26:20,040
No, she wanted him to get his Realization,

1303
02:26:20,240 --> 02:26:22,560
to feel the same joy that she felt yesterday.

1304
02:26:22,800 --> 02:26:25,080
He is very proud.

1305
02:26:33,520 --> 02:26:36,120
Heart is closed.

1306
02:26:39,160 --> 02:26:43,920
Did you say so? "Please come in my head".

1307
02:26:45,440 --> 02:26:47,240
Better now, much better.

1308
02:26:47,440 --> 02:26:49,440
Too much of... Are you Indian?

1309
02:26:49,640 --> 02:26:51,240
No, I'm Iranian.

1310
02:26:51,440 --> 02:26:55,440
P: - Iranian
SM: - Iranian? Oh, we have so many Iranians.

1311
02:26:58,160 --> 02:27:00,520
Now, better?

1312
02:27:00,720 --> 02:27:02,520
It's not.

1313
02:27:02,720 --> 02:27:04,880
It's coming up.

1314
02:27:07,280 --> 02:27:08,640
She feels hot.

1315
02:27:08,840 --> 02:27:11,080
Now you say the same thing.

1316
02:27:11,800 --> 02:27:13,640
Oh, thank you very much, madam.

1317
02:27:13,840 --> 02:27:18,080
SY: - No, from this young girl.
SM: - Oh, I see, thank you.

1318
02:27:24,360 --> 02:27:26,560
Better?

1319
02:27:32,760 --> 02:27:36,240
He, he felt it very lightly,

1320
02:27:36,520 --> 02:27:41,480
but he's worrying if it's a mental projection.

1321
02:27:41,960 --> 02:27:44,480
No, no not at all. That's why you are not feeling it.

1322
02:27:44,720 --> 02:27:49,280
Now just ask, "Mother, is it a divine process?" Ask the question.

1323
02:28:07,320 --> 02:28:11,800
Ask the question, "Mother, is this the divine process"

1324
02:28:13,320 --> 02:28:15,760
That's the answer.

1325
02:28:18,280 --> 02:28:20,600
Better now?

1326
02:28:25,040 --> 02:28:28,440
Now you have to say, "It is a divine process".

1327
02:28:32,320 --> 02:28:35,640
Then it will work out.

1328
02:28:41,920 --> 02:28:44,120
All right?

1329
02:28:48,240 --> 02:28:50,720
You have to recognize.

1330
02:28:53,120 --> 02:28:55,640
Shri Mataji,

1331
02:28:55,840 --> 02:28:59,120
this lady is the mother of Elise.

1332
02:29:03,400 --> 02:29:07,680
SY: - She feels very guilty and embarrassed.
SM: - Why ?

1333
02:29:11,440 --> 02:29:13,800
She's struggled with her hands for the last ten years.

1334
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:17,320
What is the problem? What is the problem?

1335
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,560
What is your problem?

1336
02:29:22,400 --> 02:29:25,400
She doesn't feel well inside.

1337
02:29:25,880 --> 02:29:28,400
Guilty you feel?

1338
02:29:29,640 --> 02:29:32,560
She thinks she doesn't go [unclear].

1339
02:29:35,560 --> 02:29:37,920
Just put your hand, left to Me.

1340
02:29:38,560 --> 02:29:42,640
- no, no, no just this left should be as this, this one.

1341
02:29:44,800 --> 02:29:47,160
As it is, another on the Mother Earth.

1342
02:29:47,360 --> 02:29:49,360
No, no, no.

1343
02:29:50,640 --> 02:29:52,840
There also.

1344
02:29:53,440 --> 02:29:55,880
You put it fully.

1345
02:30:03,920 --> 02:30:05,240
Better.

1346
02:30:12,440 --> 02:30:15,960
She feels all her body warm.

1347
02:30:25,440 --> 02:30:30,120
Better now? It's cooling down.

1348
02:30:39,280 --> 02:30:41,320
What about her?

1349
02:30:43,600 --> 02:30:46,600
What about her? Ask this lady.

1350
02:30:47,720 --> 02:30:51,920
Now you must come to the center to get it permanently there.

1351
02:30:52,200 --> 02:30:56,360
You get the address at the gate.

1352
02:31:11,720 --> 02:31:14,920
So she had the Realization in august but she

1353
02:31:15,120 --> 02:31:18,000
she believes in it but she couldn't feel properly.

1354
02:31:18,200 --> 02:31:19,120
She cut out.

1355
02:31:19,320 --> 02:31:21,600
But does she come to the centre?

1356
02:31:27,160 --> 02:31:29,600
Sometimes she came to the centre.

1357
02:31:29,800 --> 02:31:33,520
If she comes, she'll be all right.

1358
02:31:37,920 --> 02:31:40,200
Better now.

1359
02:31:43,840 --> 02:31:46,680
And she? He won't go.

1360
02:31:48,920 --> 02:31:54,080
What about this gentleman? How are you? All right?

1361
02:31:56,200 --> 02:31:58,840
He is now smiling.

1362
02:32:13,320 --> 02:32:17,880
She didn't, she didn't feel the vibrations.

1363
02:32:23,080 --> 02:32:28,440
Left to the right. He's not all right? Not feeling anything?

1364
02:32:36,120 --> 02:32:38,200
She feels peace inside.

1365
02:32:49,240 --> 02:32:51,520
Right hand on the Mother Earth.

1366
02:32:51,840 --> 02:32:54,720
Here. What did you say?

1367
02:33:02,440 --> 02:33:04,880
He feels very ungraceful people and so on

1368
02:33:05,080 --> 02:33:09,120
and he asks how it can help him in his day life.

1369
02:33:09,720 --> 02:33:12,280
He has been to some guru or something?

1370
02:33:12,800 --> 02:33:15,400
No, he said me no.

1371
02:33:23,880 --> 02:33:25,560
He did it.

1372
02:33:25,960 --> 02:33:28,400
All right. So you put your hand on the,

1373
02:33:28,600 --> 02:33:32,440
on the left hand side of your stomach, here.

1374
02:33:35,320 --> 02:33:39,280
Down below, down below. Yes, now, here you have to say

1375
02:33:39,480 --> 02:33:44,800
"Mother, I'm my own master". Just say that ten times.

1376
02:33:51,920 --> 02:33:54,880
He didn't feel anything.

1377
02:33:55,360 --> 02:33:57,640
All right, now good?

1378
02:34:01,880 --> 02:34:06,160
Did you go to some guru or something?

1379
02:34:10,120 --> 02:34:13,000
Two years of Hatha yoga.

1380
02:34:13,800 --> 02:34:16,800
Ask him to ask, "Mother, are You Hatha yoga?"

1381
02:34:17,560 --> 02:34:19,720
The heart catching.

1382
02:34:22,200 --> 02:34:24,680
Better now? Put to the light to him.

1383
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,040
Are you all right?

1384
02:34:28,560 --> 02:34:30,480
Not feeling well?

1385
02:34:32,160 --> 02:34:35,080
Just put your left hand to your liver.

1386
02:34:35,280 --> 02:34:37,120
He's badly caught up.

1387
02:34:37,320 --> 02:34:40,440
No, no, left, left hand, left hand.

1388
02:34:40,800 --> 02:34:43,280
That side, press it hard.

1389
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,200
Did you ask a question?

1390
02:35:00,960 --> 02:35:03,160
Better now?

1391
02:35:06,840 --> 02:35:12,440
Shri Mataji at midnight there is an extra cost of 300 pounds.

1392
02:35:12,720 --> 02:35:15,640
SM: What's the time now?
SY: - Twenty to midnight.

1393
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:19,480
SY: - Twenty to midnight.
SM: - Watch has stopped.

1394
02:35:29,520 --> 02:35:32,080
All right, you are o.k.

1395
02:35:36,360 --> 02:35:42,120
Did you say? Did he say that? "Mother, are You Hatha Yoga?"

1396
02:35:45,440 --> 02:35:47,600
What about you?

1397
02:35:51,360 --> 02:35:54,280
What she's saying, that is not cool?

1398
02:35:59,120 --> 02:36:01,960
Come now to the centre.

1399
02:36:07,200 --> 02:36:09,600
Ask him, that gentleman.

1400
02:36:09,800 --> 02:36:13,520
This gentleman, he has been in TM for six months,

1401
02:36:13,920 --> 02:36:17,480
and he, some friends told him to come here and now he would like

1402
02:36:17,680 --> 02:36:20,560
to know if you want to give him a mantra or what to do?

1403
02:36:20,760 --> 02:36:23,840
No, no mantra. Where is he come from?

1404
02:36:27,440 --> 02:36:29,120
North of France.

1405
02:36:29,320 --> 02:36:30,960
From where?

1406
02:36:33,760 --> 02:36:36,960
That's so far, that's so far from this place.

1407
02:36:37,160 --> 02:36:40,720
And he's got a Ekadesha Rudra, so ask him has he been to some guru?

1408
02:36:40,960 --> 02:36:42,720
Yes, six months in TM, six months.

1409
02:36:42,920 --> 02:36:44,240
You have been in TM?

1410
02:36:44,440 --> 02:36:46,400
Yes, he has his mantras.

1411
02:36:46,600 --> 02:36:51,960
Forget it. Horrible TM. That's why he's catching on liver.

1412
02:36:56,440 --> 02:36:59,560
You ask, "Mother, are You the source of all the mantras?"

1413
02:37:00,800 --> 02:37:04,440
Put your right hand on your left Nabhi, left side.

1414
02:37:11,320 --> 02:37:13,600
Better now?

1415
02:37:14,800 --> 02:37:18,200
What sort of Hatha yoga is this?

1416
02:37:23,960 --> 02:37:26,440
Aikido, Karate, aikido.

1417
02:37:26,640 --> 02:37:29,880
And put your hand on your heart,

1418
02:37:30,800 --> 02:37:34,920
inside, inside. inside the coat

1419
02:37:36,200 --> 02:37:39,000
and you say, "Mother, I am the Spirit."

1420
02:37:42,840 --> 02:37:45,240
He's willing to ask You if You would like to see

1421
02:37:45,440 --> 02:37:48,680
a picture of his son because he's schizophrenic.

1422
02:38:01,960 --> 02:38:04,000
Will he listen to you?

1423
02:38:04,240 --> 02:38:06,720
Will he listen to her?

1424
02:38:09,840 --> 02:38:11,280
All right, you should come and see them.

1425
02:38:11,480 --> 02:38:14,720
They will tell you what is to be done.

1426
02:38:16,920 --> 02:38:18,960
Better now?

1427
02:38:23,960 --> 02:38:27,480
Did you say that? Better?

1428
02:38:31,760 --> 02:38:33,400
Little freshness in the head.

1429
02:38:33,600 --> 02:38:36,320
All right, it's all right. You just go on saying, "I am the Spirit".

1430
02:38:36,520 --> 02:38:39,520
"Mother, I am the Spirit". Just go on saying.

1431
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:45,040
You are not the body, for her to know. You are the Spirit.

1432
02:38:48,160 --> 02:38:51,040
You should only do this when the Kundalini is rising,

1433
02:38:51,240 --> 02:38:53,680
when there's a problem, in a particular centre.

1434
02:38:53,920 --> 02:38:58,560
All right? Discriminate. Not all the way they do blindly.

1435
02:39:00,680 --> 02:39:03,000
Tell, tell, tell him.

1436
02:39:08,480 --> 02:39:10,840
Better now. He's better.

1437
02:39:11,880 --> 02:39:14,720
Shri Mataji, here is another Columbian.

1438
02:39:14,920 --> 02:39:17,000
You remember this man?

1439
02:39:17,280 --> 02:39:19,240
This one is another Columbian

1440
02:39:19,440 --> 02:39:21,920
You got it.

1441
02:39:23,280 --> 02:39:25,600
Columbia is tremendous, I tell you.

1442
02:39:25,800 --> 02:39:29,120
And see, what they told Me, in Columbia,

1443
02:39:29,320 --> 02:39:35,280
they have got the emblem of Garuda on the condor, for the Navy.

1444
02:39:41,440 --> 02:39:44,400
That's on condor, condor.

1445
02:39:44,760 --> 02:39:46,840
So I asked them why?

1446
02:39:47,560 --> 02:39:50,440
So they said their own aboriginal people,

1447
02:39:50,640 --> 02:39:54,080
their Indians, their old aboriginal people

1448
02:39:54,680 --> 02:40:01,680
told them that a God called Vishnu came from India

1449
02:40:01,880 --> 02:40:04,240
on a condor.

1450
02:40:10,200 --> 02:40:12,720
And there's something called El Dorado they have got,

1451
02:40:12,920 --> 02:40:17,240
where they have got all the gold, gold things made

1452
02:40:17,440 --> 02:40:22,200
out of gold is made like Indians.

1453
02:40:27,520 --> 02:40:31,920
And they told that Indian, Indian goldsmith used to come there,

1454
02:40:35,720 --> 02:40:38,720
Indian goldsmiths.

1455
02:40:45,600 --> 02:40:50,920
You see, that's why I said Columbia will work out.

1456
02:40:57,520 --> 02:41:01,760
He would like to share his love with You.

1457
02:41:10,920 --> 02:41:13,760
Now, what is it you want child?

1458
02:41:16,400 --> 02:41:20,120
Yesterday he didn't feel it and today he didn't too.

1459
02:41:20,560 --> 02:41:24,560
Yesterday you didn't feel? Today also you didn't feel? Really?

1460
02:41:24,760 --> 02:41:27,600
So, you are seeking God?

1461
02:41:30,560 --> 02:41:33,400
What are you wearing?

1462
02:41:38,440 --> 02:41:40,720
St. Christopher.

1463
02:41:45,760 --> 02:41:49,440
Can you take it out for one minute? One take it out, one minute.

1464
02:41:49,640 --> 02:41:51,840
It's a, You know, here's a tradition,

1465
02:41:52,040 --> 02:41:54,680
we have a chain and a medal for the baptism.

1466
02:41:54,880 --> 02:41:57,800
When you get baptism, you get a chain.

1467
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:01,920
One minute take it, one minute.

1468
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,200
Look Shri Mataji. How do you feel? Better?

1469
02:42:05,400 --> 02:42:07,040
He's all right.

1470
02:42:07,240 --> 02:42:10,760
The first country I visited was Iran.

1471
02:42:15,520 --> 02:42:16,760
It will work out.

1472
02:42:16,960 --> 02:42:18,960
Mother, there are many Iranians in Sahaja Yoga,

1473
02:42:19,160 --> 02:42:21,320
one in France and some in Austriaand in Zwitzerland.

1474
02:42:21,520 --> 02:42:23,080
But only thing is you see...

1475
02:42:23,280 --> 02:42:25,440
In Italy too.

1476
02:42:25,640 --> 02:42:27,800
Now, you just ask the question saying,

1477
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:31,720
"Mother, please give me the real baptism". Real.

1478
02:42:53,200 --> 02:42:55,520
On his head.

1479
02:42:58,840 --> 02:43:02,800
He's innocent. Now is there. He's got it.

1480
02:43:03,400 --> 02:43:08,040
Now, all right? Got it?

1481
02:43:08,240 --> 02:43:11,120
That's the real baptism.

1482
02:43:13,600 --> 02:43:15,600
Now don't wear it, there's no need.

1483
02:43:15,800 --> 02:43:19,400
You are a realized soul. Now you are really baptized,

1484
02:43:19,880 --> 02:43:21,240
You are a....

1485
02:43:22,560 --> 02:43:24,000
Thank you. Hello.

1486
02:43:24,200 --> 02:43:25,680
She is the sister of Malika.

1487
02:43:25,880 --> 02:43:28,840
I know, I know . She brought them.

1488
02:43:29,040 --> 02:43:30,400
I'm glad to see You.

1489
02:43:30,600 --> 02:43:33,760
May God bless you! I'm very glad to see you also.

1490
02:43:35,040 --> 02:43:39,720
After such a long time she came back from Lille, you know.

1491
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,440
Now, what is it?

1492
02:43:47,480 --> 02:43:49,840
Are you all right?

1493
02:43:53,720 --> 02:43:55,200
Any Sahaja Yogi here?

1494
02:43:55,400 --> 02:43:58,360
Please, please give him Realization - Hatha yoga. Ha, come along.

1495
02:43:58,560 --> 02:44:01,240
Natalie, just take him down.

1496
02:44:06,080 --> 02:44:08,720
He's done Hatha yoga

1497
02:44:08,920 --> 02:44:13,120
Raise him left to the right. Left to the right, he'll be all right.

1498
02:44:14,680 --> 02:44:17,760
What's he saying? What he is saying?

1499
02:44:19,440 --> 02:44:22,960
Ah, he didn't feel anything yesterday nor today.

1500
02:44:25,280 --> 02:44:29,680
Has he been to some guru or...? Zen Budism.

1501
02:44:36,360 --> 02:44:39,200
Shri Mataji, here is the mother of a Sahaja Yogini,

1502
02:44:39,440 --> 02:44:42,320
who is living in Austria.

1503
02:44:45,240 --> 02:44:47,480
She didn't feel much.

1504
02:44:48,480 --> 02:44:50,480
Zen.

1505
02:44:51,480 --> 02:44:55,680
Ask him to ask, "Mother, is it Sahaja Yoga the zen itself?"

1506
02:45:00,400 --> 02:45:06,240
They just talk and talk and talk. Talking is not. Zen is something,

1507
02:45:07,960 --> 02:45:09,840
Got it?

1508
02:45:10,040 --> 02:45:12,320
See it, see it yourself.

1509
02:45:21,560 --> 02:45:25,200
Coming out, coming out. Just see on his head

1510
02:45:25,520 --> 02:45:29,760
Because of Zen you didn't, you get mental activity.

1511
02:45:31,440 --> 02:45:34,000
You got it, sir.

1512
02:45:34,960 --> 02:45:38,680
This is real Zen, this is real Zen.

1513
02:45:38,880 --> 02:45:41,880
P: - I cannot feel it.
SM: - No, no, it is.

1514
02:45:55,440 --> 02:45:58,960
Now come and join them. Understand it fully.

1515
02:45:59,200 --> 02:46:02,880
All right. So what? [unclear]

1516
02:46:12,680 --> 02:46:13,760
What's he saying?

1517
02:46:13,960 --> 02:46:16,360
He wants me to ask a question.

1518
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:23,560
Backbone problem.

1519
02:46:23,760 --> 02:46:25,960
What do you have?

1520
02:46:35,440 --> 02:46:38,800
He has many problems with his backbone, and with Sahaja Yoga

1521
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,040
it has really improved but he has still sometimes...

1522
02:46:41,240 --> 02:46:43,840
You come and see Me there. I'll put you right.

1523
02:46:44,040 --> 02:46:46,560
Where? In the ashram?

1524
02:46:50,640 --> 02:46:55,120
I'll see you tomorrow, in the evening.

1525
02:47:00,120 --> 02:47:01,320
Tomorrow is a problem?

1526
02:47:01,520 --> 02:47:02,480
No, no, no, no.

1527
02:47:02,680 --> 02:47:06,040
Tomorrow evening. You are coming for the program there?

1528
02:47:06,320 --> 02:47:09,040
Now what about you?

1529
02:47:10,560 --> 02:47:14,560
Put your left hand on your liver. Ask her to put her left hand.

1530
02:47:14,760 --> 02:47:18,200
We have to go. Left hand on your liver.

1531
02:47:19,280 --> 02:47:22,840
Just ask them to put her left hand on her liver.

1532
02:47:27,240 --> 02:47:30,280
We have to go now, we are sorry.

1533
02:47:33,600 --> 02:47:36,120
Please excuse Me.

1534
02:47:37,480 --> 02:47:41,280
Why don't you all come to the center?

1535
02:47:44,320 --> 02:47:47,360
Get yourself done properly.

1536
02:47:51,560 --> 02:47:54,800
You all become experts.

1537
02:47:58,840 --> 02:48:01,440
You are all capable of getting it.

1538
02:48:03,440 --> 02:48:08,880
So why not get it? Why? Come along.

1539
02:48:10,200 --> 02:48:11,240
What's she saying?

1540
02:48:11,440 --> 02:48:13,320
I've come to Los Angeles, You remember me?

1541
02:48:13,520 --> 02:48:17,440
In August you gave me [unclear] ...

1542
02:48:18,280 --> 02:48:19,400
Now how are you?

1543
02:48:19,600 --> 02:48:21,560
I'm fine. How are you doing?

1544
02:48:21,760 --> 02:48:24,080
I'm just having problems with my stomach.

1545
02:48:24,280 --> 02:48:27,760
But you don't come to the center. You must come to the center.

1546
02:48:27,960 --> 02:48:30,600
You'll have no problems. You'll solve other's problems also.

1547
02:48:30,800 --> 02:48:33,880
I've been travelling a lot but I've been, I went,

1548
02:48:34,160 --> 02:48:39,880
when I was there in Los Angeles, not every day because [unclear].

1549
02:48:40,280 --> 02:48:43,000
Los Angeles, you come to Worlikar's place.

1550
02:48:43,200 --> 02:48:45,240
Dr. Worlikar, do you know him?

1551
02:48:45,440 --> 02:48:46,400
Yeah.

1552
02:48:46,600 --> 02:48:49,680
- That's it. - What's the stomach problem?

1553
02:48:49,880 --> 02:48:52,360
You come tomorrow evening to the center.

Thank You.
