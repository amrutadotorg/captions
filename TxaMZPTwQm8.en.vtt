00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:08.829
So, the time has come to say farewell to all
of you. I must say this time our Tour has

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.870
been really very successful. There have been
no obstructions no problems nothing, except

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:25.870
for one stupid article, we had no problem
and which they are going to look after. On

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.960
the whole, we have learnt a lot this time
and I think everybody has been feeling very

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.030
much better because of Shivratri Puja. I’ve
got reports from other countries that they

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.370
said Mother: ‘What did You do this time
on Shivratri that we all felt so much higher

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.210
and better’.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:54.210
Now the, few things I have to tell you that,
luckily you have a very good National leader

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:08.310
here, who has brought you all round very wise
person, and he is a very gentle as well as

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.610
very sensible person, and who has done, such
a good work that really I must say it’s

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.160
very remarkable, and now I have decided to
separate his work with National. See we Indians

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.910
feel very hot anywhere. We have too much of
sun within us I think. So, there, one has

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:11.180
to be thankful for that, that you have such
a nice leader here. Now I have to tell all

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.660
the people specially from Melbourne, that
you should not take things into your hands,

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:24.660
and start another sort of an organization,
arbitrarily doing something under some lady

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.879
like that Trish. If you have any problems
you can always write to Me I’ve told so

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.980
many times, but Australians don’t write
to Me is My main complaint about them. And

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.650
they should not start anything. I’m surprised
that there are so many Indian girls in Melbourne

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.370
and they also did not understand that they
have to write to Me.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:52.370
So, once you are caught up you get lost, you
get vibrations in a very funny way so much

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.500
so that I can’t even really treat them in
this short time. So there is a list of people.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.690
Can you bring the list? I’ve made the list
now, please write it down. Is there anybody

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:12.690
from Melbourne here? Yes. Go and tell them,
that you have to get all these people every

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:24.859
day, to sit down, Sunday morning maybe, and
see what sort of vibrations you have. You

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:31.969
can see it on the candle, there’s not to
go anywhere, just on the candle you can understand,

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:45.009
what’s wrong with you, and, you are getting
caught up. I’m surprised that you are supposed

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:53.159
to be Sahaja Yogi how could you not feel the
vibrations of this woman Trish. It took Me

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:58.569
not even a second to know that she is a bhoot.

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:03.339
But there’s a fraternity I think, that’s
why such nice Sahaj Yogis beautiful Sahaj

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:09.460
Yogis, got involved into it. So this is a
very serious thing and I hope this doesn’t

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.939
happen next time. Now the list is like this.
I made the list. Can somebody read it for

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:20.939
Me. Please, take it. It’s a serious thing,
otherwise you’ll be lost, I’m telling

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:23.830
you.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:30.139
Leader: Michael Davies, Jackie Hodge, Peter
Hodge,

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.210
Shri Mataji: Go slowly.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.819
Leader: Mother shall we give them a photocopy
of this?

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:45.669
Shri Mataji: Still you read it.

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:52.669
Leader: John Poulianakis, Fred Millar, Ian
Lowry, Greg Bradshaw, Lyndon DeValle, Philip

00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:07.869
Noone, Martin Purcell, Colin Berry, Jeff Platford,
Bruno Archello, Glen Pulolovich, Ben Flora,

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:34.610
Savita Noone, Cheryl Bradshaw and Helen Platford.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:44.330
Shri Mataji: They are all first class Sahaj
Yogis I tell you, all of them. And it’s

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:52.050
really beyond Me, even when he’s reading
the thing I’m getting on the left, you just

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:55.039
see, you’ll feel it, terrible. Getting the
pain here. Now how are they going to be all

00:06:55.039 --> 00:07:00.569
right? I’m worried about them.

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:07.569
Now also in Melbourne, I thought I’m sending
a very very good sensible leader. But I don’t

00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:15.619
know why people, got after him, and formed
a group outside. If I am sending somebody,

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:24.949
I should know that I know what I am doing.
So you become anti Me or what? So please all

00:07:32.379 --> 00:07:39.379
those people, who have got, these problems,
work it out every night, every morning on

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:48.960
the three candle treatment, and you can go
in the garden, sit down there, also say Ganesha’s

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:55.469
mantras. It will take some time for you to
be all right, I can tell you. Even taking

00:07:55.469 --> 00:08:02.469
their names you get left swadisthana, aren’t
you getting left swadisthana, the whole left.

00:08:05.399 --> 00:08:12.399
This can happen to anyone, because somebody
like that comes up and starts her own. Anything

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:19.740
without the leader should not be done. They
went to such a limit, that they have taken

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:30.360
out the name out of the list of telephone
of these people, can you imagine. This is

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:40.289
too arbitrary, it’s very dangerous. It should
not happen anymore. People are very good at

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:49.230
combining together when it is some sort of
a, negativity. You see if you want to hate

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:55.040
someone, immediately, fundamentalists will
join together to hate someone.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:02.040
Now for Adelaide I would say, Adelaide has
one problem also people are very arbitrary,

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:12.120
they have given Me lots of trouble before,
and if they want Me to come back, now I have

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:19.820
asked Michael Sweet, because he’s quite
good at organizing, to organize all the people

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:28.450
in Adelaide. And please support him. Now don’t
get after his life now. That shows that the

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:36.690
leaders who are unscrupulous, who are dishonest,
are more appreciated and, can dominate people,

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:49.800
while those who are good nice people, are
to be dominated. So please in Adelaide, unless

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:57.720
and until you have an Ashram I’m not going
to come there. Get an Ashram, all of you shift

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:04.750
to the Ashram and work it out. If twenty-five
people Sahaj Yogis cannot live together, how

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:12.440
do I expect the whole world to be there? Just
think of our vision.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:23.110
Then Wollongong, another thing, the other
day we had very nice people, I don’t know

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:30.110
how Sahaj Yogis are working out Wollongong.
They have to have, a proper Ashram, no individual

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:39.350
houses. Same in Newcastle. You all can have
a big house. Now these are the best days when

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:48.450
you can take a house on rent. It’s such
a God sent thing now for us, that you can

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:57.230
really get a house for a such a cheap price.
Take a big house outside, outside the city

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:05.660
somewhere, not in the city, and sit down with
your meditation. I hope you must have realized,

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:14.270
that a very great work, we are doing in Sahaj
Yoga, the greatest of greatest, and you are

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:23.130
all part and parcel, of that work. So please
try, to find out methods by which you all

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:32.970
could be closer, and understanding each other,
loving each other. Also beware of Indian girls,

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:41.310
in this respect, they have a tendency, that’s
what everybody’s informing, that they always

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:46.280
want to separate out and Indian boys also.
Otherwise they are all right.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:53.280
But one of the reasons I know now why it is,
that you see the girls, or the boys, from

00:11:55.150 --> 00:12:01.720
the west have led a different type of a life
a very different culture, and we can say it’s

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:08.720
not Sahaj, and they try to tell them, what
kind of a life they have led, and that makes,

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:16.440
them very miserable and they develop a nausea
with that. Then they are frightened. We don’t

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:21.970
have to discuss these things with anyone,
past is past is finished why do you want to

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:28.970
talk of that, filth now? So, nobody has to
discuss about the filth through which they

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:36.540
have come out. Do you mean to say that when
the lotuses come out, do they talk, or do

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:45.360
they smell of the filth out of which they
have come out. No. They spread fragrance.

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:54.170
In the same way now you are lotuses, try to
assume your powers. Even if you put somebody

00:12:55.450 --> 00:13:00.780
on the throne and make him king, still he
is in a beggarish way. Everybody comes, he

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:07.740
says; ‘Give me one dollar.’ Then what
to say? It’s the same situation. Now you

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:14.310
are out of it, finished now, so don’t discuss
these dirty things and filthy things, that’s

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:19.910
why these Indians are frightened. Because
there is a cultural difference, and they want

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:26.910
to run away. So if you don’t talk about
it, they’ll be all right. Don’t discuss.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:31.440
It’s filthy it’s dirty why to discuss
it?

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:38.440
I’ve told hundred times when you are getting
married, not to talk about your past. There’s

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:44.240
no confession and all that in Sahaja Yoga,
you know very well, and people write to Me

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:50.820
and you’ll be surprised twelve pages fourteen
pages, of their confessions. ‘I’m trying

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:57.260
I’m trying’. I don’t read even one word
out of it because immediately I know the filth

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:03.720
is there. Burn it off. So no use writing to
Me also, I don’t want to know. Finished.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.810
I don’t know what is the need for you to
write all these things. There’s no need

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:14.810
to write. All right? After all you are My
children, how you are born, is important than

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:23.340
from where you came is not important. You
are all beautiful people. I’ve already told

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:30.670
you what you are. Believe Me, you can check
out whatever I’ve said is true or not. Also

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:34.840
I’ve told you as I work without taking any
money, you too work without taking any money

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:41.840
don’t you? So please don’t discuss these
things. It’s not worth discussing talking,

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:51.920
filth. If some outsider starts tell them now
we don’t want to talk about. It’s finished

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:54.800
now, it’s gone.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:01.800
That’s how things are working out now properly.
You see I depend on you very much for one

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:09.570
reason that you are from Ganesha’s country.
If you just know how to forget it, it can

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:16.890
be worked out. You are Shri Ganeshas in the
sense, that you are now innocent. Innocence

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:24.050
is born within you, there’s a fragrance
of innocence. Why do you want to remember

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:28.810
those dirty things. Now I’m telling you
again, if I hear from anyone, that anyone

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:33.330
is discussing this, then we’ll ask them
to get out of Sahaja Yoga. Because why do

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:40.330
they want to remember the filth? Again go
back to the same filth then. All right? This

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:47.370
is not to be done again, please.

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:54.370
So now we’ll come to another point of schooling
the children. I find that, still people are

00:15:55.410 --> 00:16:02.410
very money oriented, as far as the school
is concerned. Very money oriented. Very. Now

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:12.050
for Indian schools we have calculated, how
much money will be needed and we have to also,

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:21.480
spend some money for equipping that to equip,
that school. Nobody is eating money there,

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:28.589
for heaven’s sake. As soon as it comes to
Indians immediately we’ll say, he eats money.

00:16:28.589 --> 00:16:34.540
And when so many have eaten money in schools
here, Australians, nobody even thought they

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:41.540
will eat money. So, try to understand, is
much less the price that you are paying here,

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:50.640
even for preschool. While, not only it’s
education, but also food, also other amenities

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:56.640
they have to travel and this. There is some
little profit if they get will be good idea

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.330
so that we can equip them.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:04.029
Now we have to build a high school. Who is
going to pay for the building? Is school for

00:17:04.029 --> 00:17:11.029
your children, not for Indian children. Who
is going to pay? So that is it. We have to

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:26.079
have for, even for middle school that is after
the sixth of seventh that, what you call this

00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:33.330
sixth class you call it or fifth class, we
have to have computer. They have to learn

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:40.330
about computer. Indian schools are not like
this. They have to have a science laboratory.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:49.220
If you see the subjects they have to learn
you’ll be amazed. English they have to know

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:56.220
grammar very well, they must have proper spellings,
proper handwritings. This is the minimum,

00:17:57.809 --> 00:18:04.809
I’m saying the minimum of minimum. My grandson
was studying in a school, it’s a very well

00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:12.399
know school [INDIAN NAME] School and they
were paying much more there it’s a very

00:18:12.399 --> 00:18:17.529
famous… We have private schools which we
call them as public schools and they’re

00:18:17.529 --> 00:18:24.529
all, somewhere away from the cities. He was
paying much more. But when he joined another

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:32.340
school in Delhi, which is a day scholar, he
had to pay seventy-five thousand rupees only

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:40.470
to enrol himself, and every month he is paying
ten thousand rupees when he is just a day

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:46.049
scholar, in Delhi.

00:18:46.049 --> 00:18:53.049
And this school is going to be much better,
much more equipped, various things we’ll

00:18:53.720 --> 00:19:00.720
be doing. But every time I find such a money
orientation about schools. Same about preschool

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:08.580
I’ve seen it. See we must understand that
children are to be educated by us. The first

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:19.110
thing is you should never doubt the teachers,
no way. You must respect. This is what is

00:19:19.899 --> 00:19:26.440
lacking in your education here. That’s why
children have no respect for anyone.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:33.440
I told you the story, again I’ll tell you
the same story. That my father, had a, generous

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:41.220
habits of educating boys from poor classes.
That all we do, if we have money we just don’t

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:50.070
put it for ourselves and indulge into it but,
we always try to help our poor relations or

00:19:50.309 --> 00:19:56.330
poor people. So he always had four five boys
studying. They stayed in our house and they

00:19:56.330 --> 00:20:03.129
looked after them. One of them, did his matriculation
then he was doing his intermediate. He felt

00:20:03.129 --> 00:20:06.909
little obliged and he said: ‘Sir if you
allow me I would like to teach your children’.

00:20:06.909 --> 00:20:13.909
He said: ‘All right go ahead’. We had
two, gates to enter the house one, which went

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:21.239
through the, courtyard another through his
office. One day I don’t know why he came

00:20:21.239 --> 00:20:26.279
through his office and immediately my father
stood up for him. Know he was extremely embarrassed

00:20:26.279 --> 00:20:32.860
you see, he didn’t know, just thought, everybody
got up. Who is this gentleman has come? Then

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:37.119
he went inside, and he told My mother that:
‘I touch your feet but tell Sahib not to

00:20:37.119 --> 00:20:44.119
get up for me it is too much I can’t just
bear it’. My father came in and he said:

00:20:44.129 --> 00:20:50.369
‘Why should you be embarrassed? If I don’t
respect you, then my children won’t respect

00:20:50.369 --> 00:20:57.369
you.’ You must try to be nobler people,
it’s ignoble habits, should be given up

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:05.539
otherwise your children will be ignoble.

00:21:05.539 --> 00:21:11.299
Now whatever has to be paid to the teachers
has to be paid. Apart from that sometimes,

00:21:11.299 --> 00:21:16.580
you must in the presence of children you must
try to give them some presents or some flowers,

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:23.580
respect them. That’s what they do in India,
and why most of the rich people donate money.

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:31.820
Absolutely if they have more money they donate,
money to the schools, that’s a sign of a

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:40.330
noble person. For a Sahaja Yogi it is important.
Supposing now we have somebody who doesn’t

00:21:41.769 --> 00:21:47.409
have money or maybe not a job, and he cannot
educate. Now this is a good Sahaja Yogi who

00:21:47.409 --> 00:21:51.850
has been in Sahaja Yoga for two three years,
has been giving realizations to people but

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:58.850
he doesn’t have a job. It’s our duty in
a way, to support his children to be educated.

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:04.139
See when this hand is self-supporting is all
right. I mean this is self-supporting is all

00:22:04.139 --> 00:22:11.139
right, but in case it needs the support of
this, this has to give the support.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:20.049
As we call scholarships or sometimes we call,
now we have got at least five or six children

00:22:20.049 --> 00:22:27.049
in our school there, who are absolutely free,
absolutely. Food, some of them I am supporting,

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:31.739
some of them Yogi’s supporting and some
of them are absolutely free, absolutely hundred

00:22:31.739 --> 00:22:38.739
percent. Will not tell you the names. Their
food their clothes everything and nobody knows.

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:47.950
We don’t want them to develop a feeling
[INAUDIBLE around?]. So all the time, to be

00:22:49.889 --> 00:22:56.789
very calculating about things is bad. I’ve
seen a complete, manifesto typed [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:56.789 --> 00:23:03.789
I don’t know what, about having a committee
on top of this little preschool. That is not

00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:11.639
proper. It’s conditioning, everything, even
if you have to put these, balloons you’ll

00:23:11.639 --> 00:23:18.639
have a committee. This committee on top of
that another committee another. Trust, trust

00:23:21.739 --> 00:23:28.739
and trust. We have now one committee I had
to do it, is called as the finance committee

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:39.350
all right. They are all audits, experts and
accountants and they will be here in Sydney.

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:47.190
That doesn’t mean Sydney is dominating as
someone. Some subjects have to be central,

00:23:47.519 --> 00:23:54.519
as in any government. That you should understand,
and that these can go and see your accounts

00:23:56.529 --> 00:24:03.529
if they’re all right or not. But nobody
has to dominate in Sahaja Yoga, we have to

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:11.609
help support and trust.

00:24:11.609 --> 00:24:18.029
Now in this preschool I find there are only
seven children of that age group who are studying.

00:24:18.029 --> 00:24:25.029
There are smaller children also. I have suggested
to him that why not use this area for the

00:24:25.109 --> 00:24:29.230
school there’s a school there. And I would
like children to be in My Room than anybody

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:36.230
else. So use this. You save money like that
and children will feel comforted. Everybody

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:44.700
should see if they have time what can I do
for children, can I come and help you. Instead

00:24:45.299 --> 00:24:51.179
of that, how much money you spend this that.
You see there’s no income tax in Sahaja

00:24:51.179 --> 00:24:57.989
Yoga, is there? We want to get rid of these
kind of things. Everybody feels frightened

00:24:57.989 --> 00:25:04.989
and insecure, all the time. Forget about these
things. Trust. You don’t know how many thousands

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:13.710
of dollars I’ve lost, by trusting people.
Thousands. But we have to trust. What can

00:25:14.629 --> 00:25:21.629
you do? We have to pay for our principles.
The main principle is trusting and not to

00:25:21.799 --> 00:25:26.989
ask about money where is what what is right.

00:25:26.989 --> 00:25:32.519
The second is a very bad situation here is,
because every parent can go and interfere

00:25:32.519 --> 00:25:38.279
with the teacher. Because they think they
are paying for it. You’ll spoil your children

00:25:38.279 --> 00:25:45.279
completely. Should never never interfere with
the teachers, never. With the school. I mean

00:25:54.659 --> 00:26:01.659
if you don’t have money all right. Again
you can have a committee, to find out if they

00:26:02.899 --> 00:26:09.470
really don’t have money or not. But if somebody
says I have no money I have no job all right.

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:16.470
Somebody should help them But it should not
be a kind of a police force behind these teachers,

00:26:16.769 --> 00:26:22.179
or behind the school or behind the leader.
Where is the money gone where is that gone

00:26:22.179 --> 00:26:28.869
this that? Those who worry too much of money
will never have money I tell you. Though I

00:26:28.869 --> 00:26:35.869
lose money quite a lot, but I get double I
tell you, never a problem. I never have a

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:42.529
problem of money, never never never. One must
trust.

00:26:42.529 --> 00:26:49.529
I’ll tell you one example, very nice example,
which shows how Sahaja Yoga works out things.

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:57.690
I went down to Rome, and we wanted to start
a school in Rome. We saw the land everything

00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:07.739
is very nice, but we had to deposit the money
immediately. And Guido said: ‘Mother we

00:27:07.739 --> 00:27:14.739
need about sixteen thousand pounds worth of
liras to deposit this’. I said: ‘I don’t

00:27:14.749 --> 00:27:20.539
know if I have that money with Me in the bank
or not. I’ll have to see, but doesn’t

00:27:20.539 --> 00:27:27.299
matter’. I reached the airport and I was
leaving. Suddenly, Sandra came with a packet

00:27:27.299 --> 00:27:34.299
and she said: ‘Mother this I have saved
for You’. I said: ‘What is this?’ ‘This

00:27:34.649 --> 00:27:41.649
is money, liras’. I said: ‘But why I don’t
need I don’t take any money why why do you

00:27:41.649 --> 00:27:48.229
give Me?’. Suddenly it struck Me. ‘How
much it is? What is the value?’ She said:

00:27:48.229 --> 00:27:55.229
‘Sixteen thousand pounds’. I said: ‘That’s
it’. So I got that money from her. I said:

00:27:55.359 --> 00:28:01.269
‘All right give Me give Me I’ll take it,
and give it to Guido’. I said: ‘Guido

00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:08.269
go and book your… He booked that. Then it
so happened that, the whole thing fizzled

00:28:12.409 --> 00:28:18.609
out, and he got back his money again, like
a bad penny.

00:28:18.609 --> 00:28:24.710
So we were starting this Shudy Camps. I went
there. Guido said: ‘Mother don’t change

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:31.710
your money. I have got all these liras with
me. All the things that I had to buy were

00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:41.440
bathroom fittings and all the, what you call
the wc’s and all that, plus the, all the

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:48.440
marble and all the curtains and what not,
every sort of thing. And do you know, in one

00:28:51.359 --> 00:28:58.359
day I did all that, for such a big place like
Shudy, in one day, really. It was a fast movement.

00:29:01.369 --> 00:29:07.489
And after that, I told them that you pay them
and send Me the bill what ever it is. I also

00:29:07.489 --> 00:29:12.090
gave them hundred pounds more I said: ‘These
curtains are very nice also get some more

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:18.929
for Me maybe, because they’re dark shade’.
And can you imagine when the bill came it

00:29:18.929 --> 00:29:25.929
was sixteen thousand one hundred pounds. Exactly.
So I had forgotten about hundred. I said:

00:29:28.489 --> 00:29:35.479
‘How is it sixteen thousand, what have you
done? Must be some manipulation’. They said:

00:29:35.479 --> 00:29:40.499
‘Mother no it’s, grace of God it has worked
out’. I said: ‘Then this one hundred from

00:29:40.499 --> 00:29:47.460
where?’ ‘It’s Yours. You gave us. You
forgot, this is Yours’. Then we bought the

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:54.460
land and sold it for double the price and
now they have an Ashram.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:02.600
But where people are stingy about money, think
about money, things do not work out. And also

00:30:04.369 --> 00:30:09.039
worth knowing, when we bought these two very
big Ashrams in Rome, I don’t know if anybody

00:30:09.039 --> 00:30:16.039
has seen them, here, very big, two Ashrams
we’ve got them. That too, I told him just

00:30:18.009 --> 00:30:25.009
be on the lookout. So he said: ‘Mother there
is one advertisement for a house, nearer the

00:30:27.179 --> 00:30:30.739
main road or something’. I said: ‘Main
road won’t be good’. ‘No no it’s quite

00:30:30.739 --> 00:30:36.700
in the inside but it’s away from the main
city. I said: ‘Have you seen it?’ ‘No’.

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:42.409
I said: ‘I have no time now, you’re telling
Me now, and I have to catch the plane’.

00:30:42.409 --> 00:30:48.729
He said: ‘Mother I had no time to tell You’.
Luckily that day we heard that the plane was

00:30:48.729 --> 00:30:52.889
cancelled because there was some trouble.
I said: ‘Very good, now we have got one

00:30:52.889 --> 00:30:58.309
day’. I said: ‘Can you talk to the owner
and ask him if he would like to show Me the

00:30:58.309 --> 00:31:05.309
place’. The owner accepted, and We went
there about, three o’clock, reached there

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:14.470
about three. My plane was about eight, to
India. So immediately I saw this, and that

00:31:17.119 --> 00:31:23.970
amount which we had spent, I mean, for the
buying of the land had doubled and we could

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:29.559
buy both the houses. And it’s such a big
land. Immediately I said: ‘Buy it now.’

00:31:29.559 --> 00:31:34.299
We bought it and I caught My plane and went
to India.

00:31:34.299 --> 00:31:41.099
Nobody will believe that in such a short time
we got that beautiful, it’s a very very

00:31:41.099 --> 00:31:48.099
beautiful school, and also very beautiful
area. Just see it worked out. So I have a

00:31:52.479 --> 00:31:58.659
feeling that, when you start worrying about
money it slips out somehow, nothing works

00:31:58.659 --> 00:32:05.659
out. To feel the grace is to leave everything
to God, now you do it I don’t know. You’ll

00:32:07.729 --> 00:32:14.729
be amazed how things work out. It’s beautifully,
it works out and you’re amazed because that’s

00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:21.369
how you know that you have the blessings,
how God has blessed you. Money is what, is

00:32:21.369 --> 00:32:28.369
the dust of His Feet. So, I told you when
I came these people Customs troubled Me I

00:32:32.779 --> 00:32:39.779
said: ‘I don’t know what they are going
to have now here in recession’. But doesn’t

00:32:41.279 --> 00:32:45.830
matter. It’s not going to affect you at
all, if you are in a witness state you can

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:52.830
see all that, and things will work out, everybody
will have sufficient money, but don’t worry.

00:32:57.489 --> 00:33:02.249
And the more money people have, the more they
are worried about money I have seen that.

00:33:02.249 --> 00:33:07.769
Those who have less in any case they know
that they have less so what is there to worry,

00:33:07.769 --> 00:33:13.999
like Me.

00:33:13.999 --> 00:33:20.999
But about school now, we have three classes
and I’ve already talked to Stephan, let

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:28.080
him solve the problem. If you find anything
wrong, you can tell them, but no parents should

00:33:29.629 --> 00:33:36.629
go and disturb the teachers, absolutely. You
have no right to do that. Even I would say,

00:33:45.279 --> 00:33:52.279
Indian school. Nicely all the people go, stay
there this, in which school is it allowed

00:33:52.799 --> 00:33:59.239
like this? After this, all those who have
to see their children have to stay in a hotel

00:33:59.239 --> 00:34:03.599
and see them only on a particular date which
is being told that you have to see. You’ll

00:34:03.599 --> 00:34:10.220
be disturbing your children all the time.
It’s not that anybody can go anytime live

00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:15.150
there nicely, and interfere with the working
of the school. We have to bring some system

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:22.150
into it, otherwise your children will suffer.
Even the Dharamshala school was really absolutely

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:31.780
there were a visitation, of all these bhootish
people, they tortured the lives of these teachers

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:36.929
there. This is never done.

00:34:36.929 --> 00:34:43.929
So now next time, nobody is going to go there
like this. I have told him, that if they’re

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:49.280
going to Dharamshala then they should stay
in a hostel, and the children can also stay

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:56.280
with you, not hostel we can call it a kind
of a, inn or it is a, can call it, what is

00:34:57.150 --> 00:35:03.790
it a, it’s not a big hotel but a kind of
a inn sort of thing. You can take your children

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:09.520
there with you, but you should not go to the
school all the time, and sit with them, because

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:16.520
even there they have to study. The trouble
is, Indian standards are very high. All the

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:22.580
children, though they have holidays, only
take holidays for one month and the rest of

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:26.600
the time they are all studying. You’ll see
how your children will improve, they don’t

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:33.600
know even how to spell c-a-t cat. Because
of the interference of the parents children

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:42.430
are so bad. So now if you have real love for
your children allow them to grow properly,

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:45.850
and you’ll see how they’ll come up.

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:52.850
Another thing they have no immunity for anything.
Like if there’s any jaundice, they are the

00:35:54.970 --> 00:36:00.080
first to get it, if there’s malaria they
are the first to get it, if there’s typhoid

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:06.870
they are first to get it. While Indian children
have that immunity, because I have seen here

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:13.430
also, everybody is carrying the child. Don’t
touch the child all the time. Keep the child

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:20.430
away from your body, has that, warmth which
goes to the child also. Yes sometimes you

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:27.240
have to look after the child, the child must
know you love the child, but all the time

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:31.100
carrying the child like this, I have seen
many ladies who are in my lecture also, doing

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:38.100
like this. Why what is the need? You make
the child so much conditioned, and the child

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:46.230
cannot remain quiet unless you do like this.
Massage the child nicely. Massaging is very

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:53.430
good. You should massage yourselves also,
but at least the child. Let them learn how

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:59.130
to take bath everyday. Everyday they must
be cleansed, so that they develop the habit

00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:04.270
of cleanliness. They never wash their hands,
they don’t want to wash their hands, and

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:08.790
their hands smell, they just use paper. Whatever
you tell them they’ll use paper never wash

00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:15.790
their hands. The hands smell, mouth smells.
With all your development, children have no

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:25.810
sense of personal cleanliness.

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:32.290
We have to know that they’re born-realized
children, and that they have to have, a very

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:38.150
different type of attitude towards life, as
the same way as the parents have to have,

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:44.650
a very different attitude towards the school.
It’s a very patronizing, and you should

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:51.650
be proud that you have such a school here.
Thank God, they are not in the same mess as

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:59.650
you have been. It’s so much protection to
them. So change your attitude entirely about

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:08.090
the schools, about the children, and look
after them as if you are their trustees. They

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:15.670
are in your trust and also, they should know
that you love them very much, as anybody else

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:21.340
also loves them. They must learn how to respect.
They must have good manners.

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:26.300
This can be done when the children are here,
because they don’t know how to say namaste,

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:30.700
they don’t want to say thank you, they don’t
want to say sorry, nothing of the kind. All

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:36.830
the time they’ll go on asking why, why,
and the Indian teachers start looking, Indian

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:43.830
children would not. Here they have no right
to ask. They will all be brats here, I tell

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:49.110
you all the children who are going to all
these schools whether private or to the municipal

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:55.180
schools. But the other schools that are where
there’s, horrible schools are there here

00:38:55.180 --> 00:39:01.100
I know. Because anybody who comes from those
schools, we don’t want to admit them. We

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:07.190
have had three of them, we sent them back.
It’s cheaper all right, but we can’t admit.

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:14.190
Three children have been sent away. If you
feel that you must share your money with your

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:21.210
children, then see that they get proper education,
proper grounding. Of course I am going to

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:28.210
make a proper complete sketch of how with
the teachers, how to deal with the children,

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:31.820
how to make them understand, how to put them
into proper way.

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:37.790
But this is a very important age from three
to five years I think. Till one year they

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:44.500
should be with the mother and father. But
mother should not too much also all the time,

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:51.500
handle the child, and should look after the
child, in a way as if it is in her trust,

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:58.670
massage the child, look after the child. I’ve
seen some children just go on crying. I don’t

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:04.770
know maybe the mothers must have been very
unhappy, when they were bearing the child

00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:11.770
maybe they had a bad time, with the mother-in-law
maybe with the husband whatever it is. All

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:19.580
the time crying. All right that can be corrected,
but they are our property and we have to look

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:25.730
after them. But again I say that doesn’t
mean, that a mother should expect others to

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:32.500
give bath or look after them all the time
it’s not so. So I hope you’ll use your

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:36.870
discretion now as far as your children are
concerned. I am very much concerned about

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:40.960
them.

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:47.950
Now the story goes about, people start talking
like that. About the Indian school there’s

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:53.760
lot of criticism. I would like to know how
much you have paid for the school, to build.

00:40:53.760 --> 00:41:00.760
It’s only your children studying there,
nobody else’s. How much money did you pay

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:07.960
to buy the land? Nobody enquired. How much
it has cost to build this school? Nobody enquired.

00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:16.730
But if you are sending about, ten dollars
for their food and everything. Hundred and

00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:29.990
fifty dollars for four weeks, where they eat
their food, live there, they have all facilities,

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:38.310
everything, plus their education. But that
will be very much discussed. You have to know

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:53.400
that it’s a very big headache to teach the
western children in India because every money

00:41:53.830 --> 00:42:00.830
has to be accounted for our FERanies Foreign
Exchange Regulations, and every six months

00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:10.310
we have to give the report, to the Reserve
Bank of India, how we are spending this foreign

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:20.040
exchange. And they are experts. Despite all
that, the people loose-tonguers are saying:

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:37.520
‘Somebody is eating the money there’.
It’s very difficult, you don’t know, to

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:47.760
manage the western children in India, first
of all as they are, and then secondly, that

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:55.600
the government is on top of our head, they’re
sitting.

00:42:56.060 --> 00:43:03.060
Then third is about food. Your children are
used to tinned foods. Like they’ll say we

00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:08.730
want baked beans in the morning. We want this,
we want that, every child wants something

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:09.730
else. Now the people will go crazy cooking
for all of them separately. You have agreed

00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:10.760
to such a thing, all right you want this habit.
You should not compromise: ‘No, better eat

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:11.880
this’. He won’t eat today, he’ll eat
tomorrow. Whatever is cooked for everybody

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:12.240
in the family please have it. And these tinned
fruits I am absolutely against it and I am

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:12.490
sure you also don’t want them to have tinned
fruits. They want to have, fried fish and

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:12.590
baked beans and potato chips. That’s all
they know about food nothing more, or less.

00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:12.680
So don’t send them any tinned fruits, foods,
tinned fruits. I think you better not send

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:12.770
them any food, is a better idea. Because if
you send them chocolates, their liver will

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:12.860
be spoiled. They are getting everything there,
so please if you have to give you can give

00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:13.510
them clothes or anything, but not something
to eat. Somebody brought lots of chocolates.

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:13.920
That’s how they got this, problem. Chocolates
should be avoided for children up to some

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:14.390
age, and also ice cream, but ice cream still
is not so much fat, but chocolate specially.

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.640
You can have lollipops and all those things
they are perfectly all right, lollies are

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:14.850
all right.

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:14.850
Be careful as to what habits you give to them.
And tinned food should never be given to children.

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:14.850
It’s very bad. There’s some preservation,
and for that preservation they put some chemicals

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:14.920
and that’s why the children are very susceptible.
They have no immunity. It’s easy to get

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:15.180
fresh things here. Not difficult specially
in Australia, you have no problem. Get them

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:15.430
fresh things, fresh fruits, fresh food. You
should give them. If you form that habit and

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:15.650
not from restaurants and thing. See everything
you get it in the market bring it home, and

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:15.880
just shove it into thing and give them. No.
For children be careful. Once you spoil their

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:16.230
stomachs it’s difficult to make them all
right. So be very very careful as to what

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:17.670
kind of food you are giving, even if you have
to give something, then you should read what

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:18.720
is in it you see. If there are anything artificial
things please try to avoid. These are very

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:19.610
precious children we have, and we have to
look after them.

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:19.860
Again and again I would request you, to be
very kind, to Me by looking after them in

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:20.090
a proper sensible manner, till they are with
you. Also you have to give them some discipline.

00:43:20.090 --> 00:43:20.840
It’s very important. By giving them self-esteem:
‘You are Sahaja Yogis you are this’. If

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:21.090
you give them, they have no self-esteem at
all. If you give them the self-esteem you’ll

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:21.110
be surprised they’ll start behaving very
well. By saying that see: ‘You are special

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:21.130
children, you are Sahaj Yogis, you can’t
behave like that,’ how they have to be.

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:21.220
There has to be some discipline, otherwise
at the age of six years you cannot start,

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:21.280
and even if you start it, it takes some time.
It’s exhausting, absolutely exhausting.

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:21.330
Some children are very exhausting.

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:22.100
So I hope you’ll remember this. We have
to be kind and nice, discreet, sweet to them,

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:22.680
but first we should know what is going to
be helpful to them, what is benevolent for

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:22.930
them. And just some book comes about children,
you read it, done. In Sahaja Yoga you don’t

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:22.970
have to read all such books. I’m already
going to write and I’ve already told you

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:23.090
these things. Just in a wider way, you use
your discretion. After all you are all realized

00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:23.610
souls and the spirit within you, can see in
the light of that, what is good for your child.

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:24.020
But avoid tinned food as far as possible.
Anything tinned is horrible and please don’t

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:24.360
take that for your children. I think you people
all need not also have tinned food what is

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:24.610
the need?. This cancer and all that so rampant,
in the west. In India, thank God at least

00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:24.740
what ever poor they may be they don’t eat
tin food. We can’t afford. In tin food is

00:43:24.570 --> 00:43:24.820
more expensive in India than fresh food, because
tin is expensive, luckily.

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:25.500
All right, so now this is we have done, I
have a little present for your, leader. You’re

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:26.570
an inch short of one pen, so I borrowed his,
and he said that: ‘Mother You have already

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:26.820
given me a pen’. I forget. I hope I have
never given you a watch. I never gave you

00:43:26.610 --> 00:43:26.860
a watch so you can’t say anything. All right
this is one and today is his wife’s birthday.

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:26.890
So let us sing something for her, and a little
present for her. May God bless. What a nice

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:26.930
day to be here when it’s your birthday.
May God bless.

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:26.950
Now last but not the least, very important
thing is that the senior people in Sahaja

00:43:26.850 --> 00:43:27.100
Yoga should not be called by their names.
We can say Uncle or something Uncle Tom, is

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:27.150
to be done. It’s very important, and even
I’ve heard some Indian girls calling somebody:

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
‘John’. I said: ‘What? He’s like your
father. How can you call like that?’ ‘Our

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
husbands insist.’ No, please, call them
with some sort of a uncle and aunty. Shouldn’t

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
say like that, it’s not proper, doesn’t
look nice. Or address to elders always: ‘Sir’

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
is a better idea. Shows you have some culture.
We are not brats, first of all. And also we

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
are not people who are hippies, you see. We
have to respect the elders. Very important,

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
it is that we have to respect all the elders,
that are within you. That’s how you will

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
be respected also. See to it that those ladies
or gentlemen who are senior people always

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
call them by, either ‘Mr’ or ‘Uncle’
or ‘Aunt’.

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
He was all the time with Me but I somehow
or other sneaked out tying. Ah beautiful.

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
Suits your hand very well. It’s really very
[INAUDIBLE] Very very [INAUDIBLE] All right,

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
so on a very happy note we should end up now.
Feel very sorry that I have to leave you all

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
here, and there are people waiting, as you
know in the eastern Asian countries for Me,

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
counting every minute, so I have to go.

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
Leader: Shri Mother before you go. It’s
not quite over. We have a little presentation

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
for You.

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
Shri Mataji: Ah no. You see you can’t…

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
Leader: Although it is Your…

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
Shri Mataji: It’s not My Birthday.

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
Leader: No Shri Mataji. But as it is the month
of March Shri Mother we feel that we can celebrate

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
Your Birthday in a small way but…

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
Shri Mataji: You have already given Me. Oh
chandan.

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
Leader: First we would like to..

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
Shri Mataji: Oh maa. It’s the, beautiful.
How can I blow so many candles. I think you’d

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
better do it for Me.

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
Leader: It’s a map of Australia Shri Mother.

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
Shri Mataji: Is it? Ah.

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
Leader: Including Tasmania.

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
Shri Mataji: May God bless you all. Thank
you very much. So beautiful it is. So beautiful.

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
Now come along, all the children, come along,
do for Me. This side also. I’ll be entering

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
now My seventy years of age. This is beautiful.
He will have to read it out. What’s that

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
supposed to be?

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
Leader: This is the card. To Our Beloved Mother,
it is You Who is our Shield. It is You Who

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
is the Focus of our devotion. It is You who
as Head of Your world wide Sahaja Family,

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
draws us together envelops us with love and
concern for one another. Beloved Shri Mataji

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
we your children of the great south land,
wish you a happy, gracious and triumphant

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
beginning to your seventieth year. On behalf
of all your children I bow to Your Lotus Feet.

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
Shri Mataji: And the second part also. Very
nice.

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
Leader: A little piece on the side. We vow
to You to spread Your work, to live the precepts

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
of Sahaj. We vow to You to live as one, a
great society of saints at large.

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.280
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much. Beautiful,
beautiful. Children, you must see what Austrians

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.360
have sent Me is beautiful things, and they
wanted Me to be there for My Birthday but

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:27.700
I don’t know how I’ll do it. In any case
you can have a look at the way they have wished

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:27.950
Me. Oh, this is very beautiful. Children have
done it? Oh My. What’s that?

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:27.990
Leader: I’m not sure Shri Mother. I’m
trying to find my way into it.

00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:28.020
Shri Mataji: Prohibited. So beautiful it is.
It’s too much, much too much. I don’t

00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:28.020
know what to say because, pearls are, the
Adoration of the Sahasrara you know that.

00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:28.020
There are stones on different chakras of which,
every chakra is made and the pearls are for

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:28.030
the Sahasrara. So beautiful of you to think
of that. It’s very kind. Thank you. Thank

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:28.030
you very much. Now you’ve bought it but
I’m now going to cancel also pearls from

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:28.040
My list.

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:28.040
Leader: And one final thing Shri Mother You
travel so much You have so many things to

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:28.040
remember we noticed You looked at one of these
and You thought it might be useful.

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:28.040
Shri Mataji: Ah. I’ll need somebody to operate
it. Just imagine. Budget planning period.

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:28.050
What a joke. Now then this, morning meetings.
As soon as You come out of Your bed it starts.

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:28.050
Then lunch engagements. Plan next meetings.
Then interviews. Finished.

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:28.050
Leaders: Not for those Shri Mother but for
telephone numbers and, all those sort of things

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:28.060
that You have to keep somewhere.

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:28.060
Shri Mataji: It’s quite a lot of things
I must say. I am very bad at, but somebody

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:28.060
has to look after it, because I don’t understand,
how will I work it out. [HINDI] Two thousand

00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:28.070
five hundred ninety names and numbers, and
one thousand eight hundred and twenty scheduled

00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:28.070
appointments. Large forty character by eight
line display. What are these characters are?

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:28.080
Leader: We have one appointment to put in
there straight away Shri Mother and that is

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:28.080
for the early part of next year in Australia.

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:28.080
Shri Mataji: Oh My. And the best part is,
that built in help, screens available, for

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:28.090
major functions at the touch of a button but
how do you find the button. You see these

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:28.090
buttons are so soft You just touch anywhere,
they work. All right so thank you very much

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:28.090
I hope I’ll learn something. Thank you very
much thank you. What these are doughnuts?

00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:28.100
Yogi: Profiteroles. Profiteroles.

00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:28.100
Shri Mataji: Oh. Oh My. Nobody has eaten so
far I’m the only One. [INAUDIBLE] Thank

00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:28.100
you very much. I must thank you all for really
making everyday new things for Me, taking

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:28.110
so much trouble looking after Me so well.
I feel very comfortable, all the time with

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:28.110
My children and, I was driven around in a
very comfortable car. I’ve really enjoyed.

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:28.110
And I don’t look as if I’ve done the tour
