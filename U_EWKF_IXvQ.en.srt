1
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,000
May God bless you.

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,600
Let us all meditate now.

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,920
There is no need for tying up your kundalinis,

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,720
there is no need to give yourself bandhan.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,280
There's no need at all to do anything,

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,160
if you just come up to that stage just now.

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,840
There's no need to raise your hands and tying up your kundalini,

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,160
not necessary.

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,960
Nothing is to be done.

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,640
Your kundalinis are already tied up.

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,360
Assume,

12
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,880
assume that situation,

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,120
that's all. That's what you are,

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,320
the viras, and not the stupid.

15
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,240
May God bless you all. May God bless you.

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,040
Respect yourself, respect.

17
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,760
May God bless you all.

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,760
There's nothing,

19
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,360
nothing more important to Me

20
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,960
than to see you rise to that level

21
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,960
of understanding

22
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,800
of your own values and worth, and discretion.

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,360
You have to become sweet, nice people

24
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:36,280
but very, very powerful,

25
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,000
that you can control yourself, your tongues and your things;

26
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,480
your control, complete control of yourself.

27
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,240
May God bless you again.

28
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,640
Please meditate.

29
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,280
Close your eyes, close your eyes.

30
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,360
Just close your eyes, put your both the hands towards Me.

31
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,720
Put your attention onto Sahasrara,

32
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,960
just your attention onto Sahasrara.

33
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,440
You are in My Sahasrara, all of you, just now.

34
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,840
Put your attention to your Sahasrara.

35
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,360
There's no thought, nothing.

36
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,640
Just put your attention to it,

37
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,560
and just rise up to that point.

38
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,840
There's no drama about it,

39
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,040
there's nothing artificial

40
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,800
it's actualization.

41
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,960
All weaknesses are to be left behind.

42
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:02,400
Let's be strong people of strong values.

43
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,960
With dignity and sobriety....

44
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,720
Silence, absolute inner silence,

45
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,760
and one need not talk too much.

46
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:41,840
Too much to jabber, to talk frivolously is not your way.

47
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,960
Feel it in your heart,

48
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,800
your own dignity,

49
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,320
your own glory,

50
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,520
the serenity of behavior.

51
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,360
You are all saints, but saints of very high quality,

52
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:39,400
of very high quality, not ordinary type.

53
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:32,560
Put your attention to your Sahasrara.

54
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,960
Any thought coming, say, "Not this, not this, not this."

55
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,600
May God bless you.
