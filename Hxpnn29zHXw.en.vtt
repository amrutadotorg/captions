00:09.720 --> 00:15.400
So to love God is even more difficult,

00:17.800 --> 00:21.480
without seeing Him, without knowing Him,

00:21.560 --> 00:26.160
without knowing His bounties, without getting realization.

00:26.240 --> 00:29.440
It is very difficult.

00:30.360 --> 00:33.960
But today that is not the case.

00:37.840 --> 00:47.160
But still you have to have no fear in your mind: trust!

00:47.240 --> 00:50.920
you trust yourself and trust others.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.600
First of all try to trust yourself.

00:56.560 --> 00:58.680
If you have made mistakes, you have to say,

00:58.760 --> 01:03.320
“Yes, I have made mistakes, all right. So what?”

01:03.400 --> 01:06.680
Trust yourself that you can correct yourself also.

01:06.760 --> 01:11.480
Trusting doesn’t mean blind ego trip. It does not mean that.

01:11.560 --> 01:15.280
Trust means that “Yes I can correct myself.

01:15.360 --> 01:20.600
I can improve. I can do better.”

01:20.920 --> 01:26.840
Some people think that if you trust yourself

01:27.480 --> 01:30.520
then you should never confess anything that you have done wrong.

01:30.600 --> 01:34.880
That you should never say that it was wrong and I can correct.

01:34.960 --> 01:36.600
This is a wrong idea.

01:36.680 --> 01:42.120
You have to trust yourself by saying that,

01:42.200 --> 01:46.560
“Yes I have done mistakes. I have been doing wrong.

01:46.640 --> 01:49.760
I have been faltering but I can correct.

01:49.840 --> 01:51.720
I have that strength within me.

01:51.800 --> 01:53.640
I can rise above all these things.

01:53.720 --> 02:01.480
I have that thing within me which I can use to my advantage.”

02:05.760 --> 02:07.320
Trust yourself.

02:07.400 --> 02:09.560
Trust that you are realized souls.

02:09.640 --> 02:11.640
Trust that God loves you.

02:11.720 --> 02:16.680
That He has chosen you to be His instrument.

02:16.840 --> 02:20.880
Love yourself.

02:23.160 --> 02:26.160
You are unique no doubt.

02:26.240 --> 02:30.680
As it is human beings, every individual is a unique person.

02:30.760 --> 02:39.720
But after realization you are definitely unique person.

02:42.960 --> 02:44.720
It never means ego trip.

02:44.800 --> 02:49.600
One has to use discretion about understanding.

02:49.680 --> 02:52.400
It never means ego trip.

02:52.480 --> 02:58.480
If you cannot correct yourself, you are not master of yourself.

03:02.520 --> 03:06.080
Yes you are not perfect.

03:08.640 --> 03:10.520
You are unique but you are not perfect.

03:10.600 --> 03:13.680
You have to perfect yourself.

03:13.760 --> 03:16.080
These words can be very confusing.

03:16.160 --> 03:18.560
When I say you are unique

03:18.640 --> 03:20.600
immediately, you think you are perfect.

03:20.680 --> 03:24.840
These are two words, unique and perfect.

03:24.960 --> 03:27.920
Somebody can be unique

03:28.000 --> 03:31.080
but he can have imperfections.

03:31.160 --> 03:33.960
So you have to perfect yourself.

03:34.040 --> 03:37.000
And trust in yourself that you can perfect yourself,

03:37.080 --> 03:38.840
through your kundalini awakening,

03:38.920 --> 03:40.640
clearing your chakras.

03:40.720 --> 03:45.240
By understanding yourself, you can perfect yourself.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.000
You have to perfect.

03:49.080 --> 03:54.560
I have so many ways I tell you; directly,

03:54.640 --> 03:57.680
sometimes indirectly, through friends,

03:57.760 --> 04:03.600
somehow point out that this is the problem with you.

04:04.680 --> 04:07.400
You should think that I am within you.

04:07.480 --> 04:12.520
I am that part within you which is discretion.

04:12.600 --> 04:15.200
When you do not understand your own discretion,

04:15.360 --> 04:22.400
I try to give you the direction by this way or that way.

04:22.480 --> 04:27.080
But people feel hurt. People feel bad

04:27.640 --> 04:30.080
or, some of them accept it.

04:30.160 --> 04:34.160
If you are seekers and if you are ascending,

04:34.240 --> 04:41.080
you are definitely unique, specially blessed.

04:41.160 --> 04:43.520
And you have to pay special attention to yourself.

04:43.600 --> 04:47.680
You can’t afford to play with yourself.

04:48.960 --> 04:53.000
So you have to discriminate between ego

04:56.320 --> 05:01.280
or ego trips as they call it

05:01.360 --> 05:05.080
and ascent.

05:05.840 --> 05:12.920
Ego trips bring you back with the worst hurting.

05:13.520 --> 05:17.720
It would be something like throwing you in the air

05:17.800 --> 05:19.560
and again you come back with a bump

05:19.640 --> 05:23.120
and break one of your legs or something like that.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.120
That’s what ego trip is.

05:25.200 --> 05:30.400
But ascent is where you really rise above.

05:30.480 --> 05:37.120
Not only that you rise but with you,

05:37.200 --> 05:39.360
you make others rise.

05:39.440 --> 05:46.240
In your ascent, you develop tremendous powers.

05:46.840 --> 05:49.560
The higher you ascend the better it is.

05:49.640 --> 05:52.840
But not by understanding that I am perfect you can ascend,

05:52.920 --> 05:55.080
never so.

05:59.440 --> 06:04.240
There’s a story of a teacher and his student.

06:07.480 --> 06:10.200
The teacher was very kind to the student

06:10.280 --> 06:13.720
and he would come and show him his creations.

06:13.800 --> 06:17.200
He was very kind to him.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.880
And every time he would say that,

06:20.960 --> 06:23.040
“I have done this good

06:23.120 --> 06:25.440
and this is the thing that I have not been able to do

06:25.520 --> 06:28.720
so will you please tell me how to correct it?”

06:28.800 --> 06:31.560
And the teacher would say, “Yes, good,

06:31.640 --> 06:36.640
you better correct this part, then do this.”

06:37.160 --> 06:42.720
And one day the student came and said, “Now this is perfect”.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.560
He said, “You are no more student now.”

06:51.040 --> 06:55.600
So he said, “No more. You are not to come to me anymore.”

06:55.680 --> 07:05.960
There was another student who was coming every day

07:06.040 --> 07:11.200
and correcting himself.

07:11.280 --> 07:14.720
And he told to his teacher that,

07:14.800 --> 07:18.680
“Today I think I can teach others but not yet perfect”.

07:18.760 --> 07:23.760
He said, “All right you go and teach.”

07:25.280 --> 07:29.120
The third one was a student who came

07:29.200 --> 07:34.440
and he was always trying to see

07:34.520 --> 07:37.400
what was the mistake and how he has to correct

07:37.480 --> 07:43.960
and how he worked very hard, very assiduous, very hard working

07:44.480 --> 07:52.320
and he came to his teacher one day and he said, “Sir,

07:52.400 --> 07:55.080
I will not trouble you anymore now”.

07:55.160 --> 07:59.840
He said, “True. Now you take my seat.”

08:05.880 --> 08:09.200
That is what one has to understand.

08:09.600 --> 08:14.440
You ascend. You will become humbler.

08:14.520 --> 08:17.040
It is just the other way around people understand.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.640
You see when they ascend they think we have achieved

08:18.720 --> 08:21.440
some special powers. I don’t know.

08:21.520 --> 08:24.760
Suddenly self-certification starts you see.

08:24.840 --> 08:27.280
I am very good in spirituality.

08:27.360 --> 08:31.000
I am very high up and all that. This self-certificate time.

08:31.080 --> 08:34.880
And then it can reach such a point

08:34.960 --> 08:40.560
that suddenly you found you are on the earth again.

08:41.520 --> 08:45.360
This kind of thing is not the way it works out.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.920
Actually the people who ascend

08:48.000 --> 08:53.760
there are certain qualities that show on them.

08:54.600 --> 08:58.360
The first thing is your collectivity.

08:58.440 --> 09:01.920
How collective you are.

09:03.320 --> 09:05.960
With how many people you can carry on.

09:06.040 --> 09:10.240
At how many things you can laugh.

09:10.960 --> 09:15.160
That is one of the biggest quali  ties.

09:15.680 --> 09:20.480
The second quality is that how much you accept

09:20.560 --> 09:25.960
another’s domination who cuts down your collectivity.

09:26.480 --> 09:30.440
You must have your personality separate from everyone.

09:30.520 --> 09:36.240
If you allow others to cut your personality,

09:36.360 --> 09:41.680
say for example, there is a boss and you are the,

09:41.800 --> 09:44.440
you are the employee.

09:44.520 --> 09:48.200
And the boss is not realized soul and you are a realized soul.

09:48.440 --> 09:50.680
Or maybe both are realized souls.

09:50.760 --> 09:52.440
Take it like that.

09:52.520 --> 10:00.120
And one of them is ascending.

10:00.320 --> 10:03.080
Then he becomes humbler, he becomes better,

10:03.160 --> 10:08.320
there are congenial relationship. But to a point.

10:08.440 --> 10:11.040
He will never compromise with his boss

10:11.120 --> 10:13.880
when it comes to his ascent, to his collectivity,

10:13.960 --> 10:17.560
to his giving, to his doing things for others.

10:17.640 --> 10:23.200
On that point he’ll never have any domination

10:23.320 --> 10:29.960
because how much you feel responsible about yourself

10:30.080 --> 10:34.720
is the second point.

10:34.800 --> 10:39.320
How much you are responsible to be there,

10:39.400 --> 10:41.840
to be a cell in the heart.

10:41.920 --> 10:48.680
Any cell that fails, fails the heart.

10:49.720 --> 10:56.440
Every cell in the heart has to be extremely sensitive

10:56.520 --> 10:59.320
and extremely obedient

10:59.400 --> 11:03.800
to the Self, to the Spirit.

11:06.200 --> 11:09.200
It has to activate, work harder

11:09.280 --> 11:13.880
when there is need there emergency.

11:13.960 --> 11:19.960
That it enjoys the most.

11:21.040 --> 11:25.760
And no impurity should be allowed,

11:25.840 --> 11:28.680
the third point now.

11:28.760 --> 11:30.600
As I told you first is collectivity,

11:30.680 --> 11:34.600
secondly your responsibility

11:36.800 --> 11:39.640
and third point is purity.

11:39.720 --> 11:43.880
Purity of your own heart first of all,

11:43.960 --> 11:49.720
of your own heart, about sincerity, cunningness.

11:49.880 --> 11:52.880
As I am saying this you will be realizing that

11:52.960 --> 11:58.600
all Englishmen believe in the contrary,

12:00.840 --> 12:05.600
nowadays, not olden times, but nowadays.

12:05.960 --> 12:10.360
Clean heart, transparent, open heart.

12:10.640 --> 12:13.320
Trust others.

12:13.520 --> 12:18.880
Talk to everyone with an open heart.

12:18.960 --> 12:24.080
Trust others.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.320
Why do you doubt?

12:25.400 --> 12:29.800
If you do not doubt yourself, you’ll not doubt others.

12:29.880 --> 12:32.240
What are they going to take away from you?

12:32.320 --> 12:35.800
What have you got?

12:35.880 --> 12:39.200
Nobody can take away your nose, eyes, nothing.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.640
It’s all quite intact.

12:41.720 --> 12:45.560
It’s all nicely glued down.

12:45.640 --> 12:50.040
So nothing is going to disappear.

12:50.200 --> 12:53.240
What are they going to hurt

12:53.360 --> 12:59.840
to a person who is a realized soul?

13:00.880 --> 13:02.880
If your heart is clean,

13:02.960 --> 13:06.840
you can see the other person clearly through and through.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.520
Innocence is such a powerful thing,

13:10.600 --> 13:14.440
such a powerful thing that even a glance

13:14.520 --> 13:20.680
is sufficient to kill a Satan.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.840
Purity of heart,

13:23.960 --> 13:26.760
actually when the heart becomes impure

13:26.840 --> 13:31.640
the impurity flows down to other places.

13:33.760 --> 13:36.520
It is not the other way round, is from the heart.

13:36.600 --> 13:41.200
Many people believe that it’s the body that becomes impure.

13:41.280 --> 13:43.200
I think it is the heart,

13:43.280 --> 13:45.600
which becomes really impure,

13:45.680 --> 13:48.320
and then it starts to cling down to the body

13:48.400 --> 13:54.880
and then it is residual there. It settles down there.

13:56.280 --> 13:59.800
So have a clean open heart like a child’s heart.

13:59.880 --> 14:03.240
Open heart.

14:03.320 --> 14:07.320
What is there to be afraid of anyone?

14:07.400 --> 14:12.680
What is there not to trust anyone?

14:12.760 --> 14:17.720
What is there to be angry with anyone?

14:18.960 --> 14:23.080
Talk to everyone, shake hands with everyone,

14:23.160 --> 14:24.640
be nice to everyone.

14:24.720 --> 14:27.560
On the w ay you find somebody’s difficulty,

14:27.640 --> 14:29.120
give him a hand.

14:29.200 --> 14:33.240
If somebody cannot sit properly or has a problem

14:33.320 --> 14:36.000
you try to remove the problem.

14:36.080 --> 14:40.600
If the person cannot stand, give the place

14:43.000 --> 14:45.560
Try to give from your clean heart.

14:45.640 --> 14:51.120
If your heart is not clean, it can never give.

14:53.480 --> 14:57.840
Now how do you clean the heart is the subject

14:57.920 --> 15:02.080
which Felicity wanted me to discuss, how to clean the heart.

15:02.160 --> 15:04.920
There is no broom available for that

15:05.120 --> 15:10.640
in the supermarket.

15:10.840 --> 15:17.640
There are no Fairy liquids or anything to wash it down.

15:24.280 --> 15:28.560
But there is a way.

15:28.640 --> 15:32.400
Allow your heart to be drenched in your Mother’s love.

15:32.480 --> 15:36.680
Just allow. See how much She loves you.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.920
I trust you.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.880
People laugh at Me sometimes.

15:41.960 --> 15:45.040
Some of these saints who are supposed to be very great people,

15:45.120 --> 15:47.040
they can’t understand how I trust you.

15:47.120 --> 15:51.160
They say that oh these are all lost cases.

15:51.240 --> 15:55.560
These are horrible people how do you trust them?

15:55.640 --> 15:56.840
They are not sanyasis,

15:56.920 --> 15:59.240
they are not sadhus, they are nothing.

15:59.320 --> 16:02.320
They are ordinary people.

16:02.400 --> 16:06.200
For them I mean your value is nothing.

16:06.280 --> 16:10.200
They’ll if you go to them they will make you stand on your head

16:10.280 --> 16:12.440
for three months.

16:12.520 --> 16:15.400
For three years, they may hang you on a well.

16:15.480 --> 16:19.000
I don’t know what they will do to test you.

16:19.080 --> 16:22.080
But I trusted you the day I saw you.

16:22.160 --> 16:25.280
The day you came to me I trusted you.

16:25.360 --> 16:28.720
And I worked on you from the very first day,

16:28.800 --> 16:31.000
knowing what you are

16:31.080 --> 16:33.720
but I trust your Spirit

16:33.800 --> 16:35.000
that it would shine.

16:35.080 --> 16:39.200
In the same way, trust. We laugh at others.

16:39.280 --> 16:42.800
I have seen Sahaja Yogis laugh at others;

16:42.880 --> 16:47.000
make fun of them when they come to Me.

16:48.360 --> 16:49.960
Trust them.

16:50.040 --> 16:54.680
When you will trust them, you will respect them also.

16:56.160 --> 16:59.680
So you have to believe

17:00.680 --> 17:08.960
in yourself and enjoy the way

17:09.040 --> 17:13.520
gently you are sweeping

17:13.600 --> 17:17.080
into the current of your Mother’s love.

17:17.160 --> 17:21.360
Just enjoy that.

17:22.400 --> 17:27.280
Like a flower that falls into the current

17:27.360 --> 17:33.840
and flows and enjoys all the beauties of that current.

17:33.920 --> 17:42.200
In the same way, you should enjoy.

17:43.640 --> 17:46.720
When that enjoyment comes into you,

17:46.800 --> 17:50.400
you will start trusting.

17:50.480 --> 17:55.520
And trust your Mothe r.

17:56.480 --> 18:00.320
I try many things to correct you.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.120
But trust in one thing, that

18:02.200 --> 18:08.200
whatever I try for you or do anything,

18:08.280 --> 18:14.240
anything I may do for you it is just to clean you.

18:14.320 --> 18:19.480
That’s My job.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.360
May sometimes you might feel

18:21.440 --> 18:23.960
I am publicly saying things for you.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.800
May be your images are being ruined by that

18:26.880 --> 18:28.960
or whatever you may think.

18:29.040 --> 18:33.000
That’s not the way,

18:34.200 --> 18:36.880
is for your hitha,

18:36.960 --> 18:40.840
is for the well-being of your Spirit.

18:44.720 --> 18:49.240
And that is the most difficult job.

18:53.840 --> 19:02.000
With all this, trust in your heart.

19:02.960 --> 19:06.000
First trust yourself,

19:06.080 --> 19:08.440
trust others,

19:08.520 --> 19:11.360
other Sahaja Yogis.

19:11.440 --> 19:13.200
Love thy neighbor as thyself.

19:13.280 --> 19:17.000
Who is your neighbor? He is a Sahaja Yogi.

19:17.160 --> 19:21.680
Stand by him.

19:25.680 --> 19:28.240
And trust your Mother.

19:28.320 --> 19:30.520
As I have trusted you,

19:30.600 --> 19:34.960
you have to trust Me,

19:35.720 --> 19:39.400
and it will work out.

19:40.040 --> 19:45.560
Open your heart to this trust.

19:49.680 --> 19:51.320
You should not worry

19:51.400 --> 19:55.880
whether it would be protocolish all right or not,

19:55.960 --> 20:02.120
whether it would be absolutely respectable or not,

20:02.320 --> 20:03.760
because heart knows.

20:03.840 --> 20:05.560
Whatever your heart will do

20:05.640 --> 20:09.280
in its genuine form will be respectable,

20:09.360 --> 20:14.200
because there resides your Spirit, which manifests.

20:14.680 --> 20:16.960
That will look after you.

20:17.040 --> 20:20.920
By outer forms, whatever you try

20:21.000 --> 20:23.360
is not going to work out.

20:23.440 --> 20:28.320
It is that trust in your loving heart

20:28.400 --> 20:30.920
that is going to work. It doesn’t matter.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.840
You see today she brought some flowers.

20:33.920 --> 20:37.440
There were some supposed to be weeds according to her.

20:37.520 --> 20:43.120
She went to the station and there she was taking some flowers out.

20:43.320 --> 20:46.760
And the station master and his wife were very sweet

20:46.840 --> 20:48.160
and they said, “Oh go ahead.

20:48.240 --> 20:49.880
They are only weeds you can have them.”

20:49.960 --> 20:51.600
And they are so fragrant.

20:51.680 --> 20:54.920
One of the most fragrant flowers I have ever seen.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
They are just weeds.

20:57.080 --> 21:00.240
They do not conform to any formal flowers,

21:00.320 --> 21:07.240
but just few flowers attached to other flowers were most fragrant.

21:07.320 --> 21:12.080
Love gives all the sophistication and the fragrance

21:12.160 --> 21:16.760
and all the breeding that is required.

21:16.840 --> 21:23.280
Not talking of love but really loving is the way,

21:24.480 --> 21:27.800
it's most enjoyable.
