00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.400
So to love God is even more difficult,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.480
without seeing Him, without knowing Him,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.160
without knowing His bounties, without getting realization.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.440
It is very difficult.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.960
But today that is not the case.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:47.160
But still you have to have no fear in your mind: trust!

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.920
you trust yourself and trust others.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.600
First of all try to trust yourself.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.680
If you have made mistakes, you have to say,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.320
“Yes, I have made mistakes, all right. So what?”

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.680
Trust yourself that you can correct yourself also.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.480
Trusting doesn’t mean blind ego trip. It does not mean that.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.280
Trust means that “Yes I can correct myself.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.600
I can improve. I can do better.”

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.840
Some people think that if you trust yourself

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.520
then you should never confess anything that you have done wrong.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.880
That you should never say that it was wrong and I can correct.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.600
This is a wrong idea.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.120
You have to trust yourself by saying that,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.560
“Yes I have done mistakes. I have been doing wrong.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.760
I have been faltering but I can correct.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.720
I have that strength within me.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.640
I can rise above all these things.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:01.480
I have that thing within me which I can use to my advantage.”

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.320
Trust yourself.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.560
Trust that you are realized souls.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.640
Trust that God loves you.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.680
That He has chosen you to be His instrument.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.880
Love yourself.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.160
You are unique no doubt.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.680
As it is human beings, every individual is a unique person.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:39.720
But after realization you are definitely unique person.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.720
It never means ego trip.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.600
One has to use discretion about understanding.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.400
It never means ego trip.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.480
If you cannot correct yourself, you are not master of yourself.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.080
Yes you are not perfect.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.520
You are unique but you are not perfect.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.680
You have to perfect yourself.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.080
These words can be very confusing.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.560
When I say you are unique

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.600
immediately, you think you are perfect.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.840
These are two words, unique and perfect.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.920
Somebody can be unique

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.080
but he can have imperfections.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.960
So you have to perfect yourself.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.000
And trust in yourself that you can perfect yourself,

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.840
through your kundalini awakening,

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.640
clearing your chakras.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.240
By understanding yourself, you can perfect yourself.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.000
You have to perfect.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.560
I have so many ways I tell you; directly,

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.680
sometimes indirectly, through friends,

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.600
somehow point out that this is the problem with you.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.400
You should think that I am within you.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.520
I am that part within you which is discretion.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.200
When you do not understand your own discretion,

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:22.400
I try to give you the direction by this way or that way.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.080
But people feel hurt. People feel bad

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.080
or, some of them accept it.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.160
If you are seekers and if you are ascending,

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:41.080
you are definitely unique, specially blessed.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.520
And you have to pay special attention to yourself.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.680
You can’t afford to play with yourself.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.000
So you have to discriminate between ego

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.280
or ego trips as they call it

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.080
and ascent.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.920
Ego trips bring you back with the worst hurting.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.720
It would be something like throwing you in the air

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.560
and again you come back with a bump

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.120
and break one of your legs or something like that.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.120
That’s what ego trip is.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.400
But ascent is where you really rise above.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:37.120
Not only that you rise but with you,

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.360
you make others rise.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:46.240
In your ascent, you develop tremendous powers.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.560
The higher you ascend the better it is.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.840
But not by understanding that I am perfect you can ascend,

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.080
never so.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.240
There’s a story of a teacher and his student.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.200
The teacher was very kind to the student

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.720
and he would come and show him his creations.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.200
He was very kind to him.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.880
And every time he would say that,

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.040
“I have done this good

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.440
and this is the thing that I have not been able to do

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.720
so will you please tell me how to correct it?”

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.560
And the teacher would say, “Yes, good,

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.640
you better correct this part, then do this.”

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:42.720
And one day the student came and said, “Now this is perfect”.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.560
He said, “You are no more student now.”

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.600
So he said, “No more. You are not to come to me anymore.”

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:05.960
There was another student who was coming every day

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:11.200
and correcting himself.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.720
And he told to his teacher that,

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.680
“Today I think I can teach others but not yet perfect”.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:23.760
He said, “All right you go and teach.”

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.120
The third one was a student who came

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:34.440
and he was always trying to see

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.400
what was the mistake and how he has to correct

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:43.960
and how he worked very hard, very assiduous, very hard working

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:52.320
and he came to his teacher one day and he said, “Sir,

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.080
I will not trouble you anymore now”.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.840
He said, “True. Now you take my seat.”

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.200
That is what one has to understand.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.440
You ascend. You will become humbler.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.040
It is just the other way around people understand.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.640
You see when they ascend they think we have achieved

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.440
some special powers. I don’t know.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.760
Suddenly self-certification starts you see.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.280
I am very good in spirituality.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.000
I am very high up and all that. This self-certificate time.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.880
And then it can reach such a point

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:40.560
that suddenly you found you are on the earth again.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.360
This kind of thing is not the way it works out.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.920
Actually the people who ascend

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.760
there are certain qualities that show on them.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.360
The first thing is your collectivity.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.920
How collective you are.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.960
With how many people you can carry on.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:10.240
At how many things you can laugh.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:15.160
That is one of the biggest quali  ties.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:20.480
The second quality is that how much you accept

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.960
another’s domination who cuts down your collectivity.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.440
You must have your personality separate from everyone.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:36.240
If you allow others to cut your personality,

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.680
say for example, there is a boss and you are the,

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.440
you are the employee.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.200
And the boss is not realized soul and you are a realized soul.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.680
Or maybe both are realized souls.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.440
Take it like that.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:10:00.120
And one of them is ascending.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.080
Then he becomes humbler, he becomes better,

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:08.320
there are congenial relationship. But to a point.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.040
He will never compromise with his boss

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.880
when it comes to his ascent, to his collectivity,

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.560
to his giving, to his doing things for others.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:23.200
On that point he’ll never have any domination

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:29.960
because how much you feel responsible about yourself

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.720
is the second point.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.320
How much you are responsible to be there,

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.840
to be a cell in the heart.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:48.680
Any cell that fails, fails the heart.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:56.440
Every cell in the heart has to be extremely sensitive

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.320
and extremely obedient

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:03.800
to the Self, to the Spirit.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.200
It has to activate, work harder

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:13.880
when there is need there emergency.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:19.960
That it enjoys the most.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:25.760
And no impurity should be allowed,

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.680
the third point now.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.600
As I told you first is collectivity,

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:34.600
secondly your responsibility

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.640
and third point is purity.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.880
Purity of your own heart first of all,

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:49.720
of your own heart, about sincerity, cunningness.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.880
As I am saying this you will be realizing that

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:58.600
all Englishmen believe in the contrary,

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:05.600
nowadays, not olden times, but nowadays.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.360
Clean heart, transparent, open heart.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:13.320
Trust others.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:18.880
Talk to everyone with an open heart.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:24.080
Trust others.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.320
Why do you doubt?

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:29.800
If you do not doubt yourself, you’ll not doubt others.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.240
What are they going to take away from you?

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.800
What have you got?

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.200
Nobody can take away your nose, eyes, nothing.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.640
It’s all quite intact.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:45.560
It’s all nicely glued down.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:50.040
So nothing is going to disappear.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.240
What are they going to hurt

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:59.840
to a person who is a realized soul?

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.880
If your heart is clean,

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.840
you can see the other person clearly through and through.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.520
Innocence is such a powerful thing,

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:14.440
such a powerful thing that even a glance

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:20.680
is sufficient to kill a Satan.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.840
Purity of heart,

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.760
actually when the heart becomes impure

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:31.640
the impurity flows down to other places.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.520
It is not the other way round, is from the heart.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:41.200
Many people believe that it’s the body that becomes impure.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.200
I think it is the heart,

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.600
which becomes really impure,

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.320
and then it starts to cling down to the body

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:54.880
and then it is residual there. It settles down there.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.800
So have a clean open heart like a child’s heart.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.240
Open heart.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:07.320
What is there to be afraid of anyone?

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:12.680
What is there not to trust anyone?

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:17.720
What is there to be angry with anyone?

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:23.080
Talk to everyone, shake hands with everyone,

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.640
be nice to everyone.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.560
On the w ay you find somebody’s difficulty,

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.120
give him a hand.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:33.240
If somebody cannot sit properly or has a problem

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.000
you try to remove the problem.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:40.600
If the person cannot stand, give the place

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.560
Try to give from your clean heart.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:51.120
If your heart is not clean, it can never give.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:57.840
Now how do you clean the heart is the subject

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:02.080
which Felicity wanted me to discuss, how to clean the heart.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.920
There is no broom available for that

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:10.640
in the supermarket.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:17.640
There are no Fairy liquids or anything to wash it down.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:28.560
But there is a way.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:32.400
Allow your heart to be drenched in your Mother’s love.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:36.680
Just allow. See how much She loves you.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.920
I trust you.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.880
People laugh at Me sometimes.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:45.040
Some of these saints who are supposed to be very great people,

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.040
they can’t understand how I trust you.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:51.160
They say that oh these are all lost cases.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:55.560
These are horrible people how do you trust them?

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:56.840
They are not sanyasis,

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.240
they are not sadhus, they are nothing.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.320
They are ordinary people.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:06.200
For them I mean your value is nothing.

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:10.200
They’ll if you go to them they will make you stand on your head

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.440
for three months.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.400
For three years, they may hang you on a well.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:19.000
I don’t know what they will do to test you.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.080
But I trusted you the day I saw you.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.280
The day you came to me I trusted you.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.720
And I worked on you from the very first day,

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.000
knowing what you are

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.720
but I trust your Spirit

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.000
that it would shine.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:39.200
In the same way, trust. We laugh at others.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.800
I have seen Sahaja Yogis laugh at others;

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:47.000
make fun of them when they come to Me.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.960
Trust them.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:54.680
When you will trust them, you will respect them also.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.680
So you have to believe

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:08.960
in yourself and enjoy the way

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:13.520
gently you are sweeping

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:17.080
into the current of your Mother’s love.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:21.360
Just enjoy that.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:27.280
Like a flower that falls into the current

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:33.840
and flows and enjoys all the beauties of that current.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:42.200
In the same way, you should enjoy.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.720
When that enjoyment comes into you,

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.400
you will start trusting.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:55.520
And trust your Mothe r.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:00.320
I try many things to correct you.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.120
But trust in one thing, that

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:08.200
whatever I try for you or do anything,

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:14.240
anything I may do for you it is just to clean you.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:19.480
That’s My job.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.360
May sometimes you might feel

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.960
I am publicly saying things for you.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.800
May be your images are being ruined by that

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.960
or whatever you may think.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:33.000
That’s not the way,

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.880
is for your hitha,

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.840
is for the well-being of your Spirit.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:49.240
And that is the most difficult job.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:19:02.000
With all this, trust in your heart.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.000
First trust yourself,

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.440
trust others,

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.360
other Sahaja Yogis.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.200
Love thy neighbor as thyself.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:17.000
Who is your neighbor? He is a Sahaja Yogi.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:21.680
Stand by him.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.240
And trust your Mother.

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.520
As I have trusted you,

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:34.960
you have to trust Me,

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:39.400
and it will work out.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:45.560
Open your heart to this trust.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.320
You should not worry

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:55.880
whether it would be protocolish all right or not,

00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:02.120
whether it would be absolutely respectable or not,

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.760
because heart knows.

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.560
Whatever your heart will do

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:09.280
in its genuine form will be respectable,

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:14.200
because there resides your Spirit, which manifests.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.960
That will look after you.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.920
By outer forms, whatever you try

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.360
is not going to work out.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:28.320
It is that trust in your loving heart

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.920
that is going to work. It doesn’t matter.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.840
You see today she brought some flowers.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.440
There were some supposed to be weeds according to her.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:43.120
She went to the station and there she was taking some flowers out.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.760
And the station master and his wife were very sweet

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.160
and they said, “Oh go ahead.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.880
They are only weeds you can have them.”

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.600
And they are so fragrant.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.920
One of the most fragrant flowers I have ever seen.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
They are just weeds.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.240
They do not conform to any formal flowers,

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:07.240
but just few flowers attached to other flowers were most fragrant.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:12.080
Love gives all the sophistication and the fragrance

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:16.760
and all the breeding that is required.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:23.280
Not talking of love but really loving is the way,

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.800
it's most enjoyable.
