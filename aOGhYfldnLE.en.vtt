00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:11.258
So I’m now going to tell you

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:14.524
the story of Shri Ganesha’s birth.

00:00:14.605 --> 00:00:18.971
Is very interesting, it’s very symbolic. This is Christ, and that is,

00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:23.316
He is the Omega and He is the Alpha and all that they talk of,

00:00:23.517 --> 00:00:25.764
they don’t know what they are talking.

00:00:25.965 --> 00:00:29.557
There’s so short form of what the whole thing is.

00:00:29.758 --> 00:00:32.187
They don’t know Ganesha at all, nothing.

00:00:32.388 --> 00:00:37.598
They just take one word here and there, just talk like that.

00:00:39.017 --> 00:00:43.124
So He’s the first one created.

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:46.505
Now it’s very symbolic:

00:00:46.706 --> 00:00:49.778
the pure power

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:57.479
of desire to be one with the spirit is symbolized in the Gauri.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.285
The primordial Gauri is that power

00:01:02.486 --> 00:01:06.460
which has separated from Her Lord,

00:01:06.657 --> 00:01:09.485
we can say.

00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:13.958
In Her previous lives She was separated,

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.821
and again She’s born as Parvati.

00:01:18.022 --> 00:01:23.490
And She wants to be one with Shiva, which is the Spirit.

00:01:25.088 --> 00:01:27.823
So now the marriage has taken place,

00:01:28.024 --> 00:01:31.757
in the sense that now She can meet Him.

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:35.403
The wedding kindling has to start.

00:01:36.137 --> 00:01:37.783
But She’s not yet married,

00:01:37.984 --> 00:01:39.869
in the sense that She’s still a Virgin,

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:48.314
but married otherwise – means She is now about to rise.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.741
Before that She wants to have a bath,

00:01:52.942 --> 00:01:55.882
because She has to meet Her Lord.

00:01:56.083 --> 00:01:59.631
So She must have Her bath, the bridal bath.

00:01:59.832 --> 00:02:04.996
She’s a virgin, absolutely virgin, and She goes for Her bath.

00:02:06.052 --> 00:02:08.952
Now, She’s afraid that anybody might come inside

00:02:09.153 --> 00:02:12.074
when She’s having Her bath.

00:02:12.984 --> 00:02:15.243
Look at the delicacy of the whole thing:

00:02:15.444 --> 00:02:20.153
this desire, which just is meant for the spirit,

00:02:20.354 --> 00:02:22.631
doesn’t want to be exposed to anything else,

00:02:22.832 --> 00:02:26.449
any negativity coming in, anything happening like that.

00:02:27.238 --> 00:02:30.544
So She closes the door,

00:02:30.745 --> 00:02:35.596
but still She’s worried from the back side somebody may come.

00:02:36.098 --> 00:02:46.845
So She puts this scented powder, which we use in India,

00:02:47.046 --> 00:02:50.328
for the bride specially it is the right one,

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:53.282
and rubs Her body with that, and She finds

00:02:53.483 --> 00:02:56.692
that a lot of it comes out. So She makes the Ganesha out of that,

00:02:56.893 --> 00:03:01.150
now imagine how much vibrated it must be.

00:03:04.692 --> 00:03:07.806
She puts that – is made of camphor

00:03:07.887 --> 00:03:11.858
and all these beautiful things which are really celestial –

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:16.598
and that is completely vibrated on Her body.

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:22.338
She makes a Ganesha and puts Him to the back of the bathroom;

00:03:22.903 --> 00:03:25.570
She’s having Her bath nicely.

00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:30.868
At that time Shiva comes suddenly, knocks at the door.

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.420
She doesn’t hear Him.

00:03:33.621 --> 00:03:39.503
So He goes from the back door. There
He sees Shri Ganesha sitting.

00:03:40.442 --> 00:03:42.786
He asks Shri Ganesha, “Who are You?”

00:03:42.977 --> 00:03:47.576
So He says, “I am the Son of Gauri.”

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.537
Shiva can’t understand; She is a Virgin

00:03:50.738 --> 00:03:53.601
and this one is saying, “I am the Son of the Gauri.”

00:03:53.802 --> 00:03:57.671
See now the Immaculate Conception,

00:03:57.872 --> 00:04:00.190
try to understand.

00:04:00.391 --> 00:04:08.337
So Shiva says, “How can She have a child? She is the Virgin.”

00:04:08.538 --> 00:04:13.340
And He thinks [She’s] He’s bringing slander on His wife who is a Virgin.

00:04:13.541 --> 00:04:18.052
So He cuts His neck in anger,

00:04:18.253 --> 00:04:20.855
and He enters into the bathroom.

00:04:21.057 --> 00:04:24.936
And Gauri is ready to receive Him.

00:04:25.143 --> 00:04:29.082
And She looks out and She sees Her child is dead.

00:04:29.283 --> 00:04:34.087
So He asked Her, “What is this?”

00:04:34.288 --> 00:04:39.016
Said, “That’s My child I created out of My, this mala” –

00:04:39.217 --> 00:04:42.254
what you call this, all the body things that came out –

00:04:42.455 --> 00:04:46.133
“I’ve created Him, and I have put Him down there.

00:04:46.334 --> 00:04:49.162
How dare You kill Him?”

00:04:49.457 --> 00:04:51.551
She said, “ Now what to do?”

00:04:51.752 --> 00:04:54.363
He said, “All right, what You do is to go

00:04:54.564 --> 00:05:02.128
and find the head of any animal that is available,

00:05:02.329 --> 00:05:06.480
and we will put that on this trunk

00:05:06.697 --> 00:05:10.296
and He’ll be My son again.”

00:05:10.497 --> 00:05:14.656
Now it’s all prearranged;

00:05:14.864 --> 00:05:18.775
because this child was not to grow into

00:05:18.976 --> 00:05:21.858
a human ego and superego business.

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:26.230
It had to be the embodiment of childhood,

00:05:26.431 --> 00:05:31.766
embodiment of childlike innocence,

00:05:31.967 --> 00:05:35.015
because He’s the embodiment of innocence.

00:05:35.216 --> 00:05:38.777
So they had to get the head of an animal.

00:05:38.978 --> 00:05:47.903
Now the wisest animal on this Earth is elephant,

00:05:48.104 --> 00:05:51.675
and elephant was saved in evolution in a very miraculous way,

00:05:51.876 --> 00:05:55.602
is also another description which I’ll give you later on.

00:05:55.986 --> 00:05:59.720
So a she-elephant, mother elephant

00:05:59.921 --> 00:06:03.804
was lying down with her back towards her child,

00:06:04.005 --> 00:06:07.552
that’s why in India women never sleep with their back

00:06:07.753 --> 00:06:09.896
towards their children, never.

00:06:10.097 --> 00:06:13.733
The child has to be in front, pudhe, in front.

00:06:13.934 --> 00:06:17.226
It should never be put at the back of the mother, never.

00:06:17.427 --> 00:06:20.947
Mother will get up and go on the other side and change the sides,

00:06:21.148 --> 00:06:23.716
but she would never put the child at the back.

00:06:23.917 --> 00:06:27.612
So the head of that little animal was cut,

00:06:27.813 --> 00:06:31.831
and He brought it and was put for Shri Ganesh.

00:06:32.032 --> 00:06:34.815
And that’s how Shri Ganesha was created.
