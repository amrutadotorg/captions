00:00:06.213 --> 00:00:09.043
It is very difficult to tell anybody if something is wrong

00:00:09.244 --> 00:00:12.137
with that person, it's impossible.

00:00:12.338 --> 00:00:15.121
After Sahaja Yoga, I can tell you, this Chakra is catching,

00:00:15.322 --> 00:00:17.998
that Chakra is catching. But also because you know

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.658
what does that Chakra means, you can come back on me.

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.279
"No, no, Mother, You see, it's not so. I'm not."

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.060
That's not so, why should I tell you you are catching?

00:00:26.261 --> 00:00:29.544
You have to cleanse yourself with full honesty.

00:00:29.745 --> 00:00:33.161
But first thing is to recognize with full humility

00:00:33.362 --> 00:00:35.903
and understanding.

00:00:36.104 --> 00:00:42.012
Once you have recognized, gradually you will do everything

00:00:42.213 --> 00:00:47.877
that has to be done, you'll know - what is to be done.

00:00:51.235 --> 00:00:57.172
Now the essence of Sahastrara is integration.

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:02.104
In Sahastrara all the Chakras are there,

00:01:02.305 --> 00:01:06.354
so all the Deities get integrated.

00:01:06.555 --> 00:01:12.862
And you can feel their integration. That means, when you get your

00:01:13.063 --> 00:01:17.901
Kundalini in Sahastrara, your mental, emotional,

00:01:18.102 --> 00:01:24.346
and your spiritual, everything being becomes one.

00:01:24.547 --> 00:01:28.205
Your physical being also merges into it.

00:01:28.406 --> 00:01:31.783
Then you have no problem, as to,

00:01:31.984 --> 00:01:36.550
"Yes, I love Mother. But ah I'm sorry, ah -

00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:42.188
I have to steal this money."

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:48.043
"Yes, I know, I recognize Mother, yes, I know She is great,

00:01:48.244 --> 00:01:54.283
but I can't help it I have to tell Her lies".

00:01:54.846 --> 00:02:00.067
Or, "I have to do this wrong thing, because after all,

00:02:00.268 --> 00:02:06.223
ah - I can't help it." There is no compromise with Me.

00:02:06.424 --> 00:02:08.840
It has to be completely integrated.

00:02:09.041 --> 00:02:14.262
Your Dharma should be corrected. You can not do anything wrong

00:02:14.463 --> 00:02:17.340
and then say, "I'm a Sahaja Yogi." You cannot.

00:02:17.541 --> 00:02:21.832
But for this, the strength comes from within.

00:02:22.033 --> 00:02:24.033
Your Spirit strengthens you.

00:02:24.234 --> 00:02:29.447
You must just put in your will-power that "Yes, let my Spirit act."

00:02:29.648 --> 00:02:33.885
And then you start acting according to the Spirit.

00:02:34.086 --> 00:02:37.830
Once you start acting according to the Spirit,

00:02:38.031 --> 00:02:41.408
you find you have no slavery of anything.

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:46.002
You become Samarth, means equal to your meanings.

00:02:46.203 --> 00:02:50.135
Samartha, also Samarth means powerful personality.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:53.276
So, you develop that powerful personality

00:02:53.477 --> 00:02:58.081
which has no temptations, which has no wrong ideas,

00:02:58.282 --> 00:03:03.407
which has no catches, no problems.
