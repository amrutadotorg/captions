WEBVTT

00:00:17.734 --> 00:00:22.784
and because of the cleansing
of the feet of Christ

00:00:22.864 --> 00:00:27.214
they said, "Why should we waste such a lot of
oil? You can sell it and give it to the poor."

00:00:27.262 --> 00:00:29.762
but Christ said, now see what he said!

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:36.310
that Christ Himself has said these words
and if they are depicted the same way.

00:00:36.326 --> 00:00:38.826
You just see the meaning and
what you should take out.

00:00:38.837 --> 00:00:44.869
He says that, "These poor are for
ever, but I am for a short time.

00:00:44.922 --> 00:00:49.884
You see? How clearly He has said that
there's no philanthropic work involved.

00:00:52.744 --> 00:00:56.829
But people take the other meaning! I don't
know from where you get the other meaning?

00:00:56.854 --> 00:00:59.354
That you must look after the poor.

00:00:59.386 --> 00:01:01.886
That's not you job at all!

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:08.600
Alright Atul? That's not your
job to look after the poor.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.982
What we have to work out,
in the middle, you see.

00:01:12.007 --> 00:01:14.892
by which we can pull the right
and left to both the banks.

00:01:17.937 --> 00:01:21.502
You have to be in the middle. When
we are in the middle course,

00:01:21.525 --> 00:01:27.905
we first of all settle down ourselves nicely
and then the left and right can be engulfed.

00:01:27.905 --> 00:01:31.615
The poor and the rich! The
over-rich are horrid people!

00:01:34.305 --> 00:01:38.845
They smoke and they drink. I
mean, they are wretched people.

00:01:38.905 --> 00:01:41.405
Gambling, this, that, all
sorts of things they do.

00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:43.905
They waste their lives. They don't
know how to face themselves.

00:01:43.905 --> 00:01:46.405
They are in the worst possible condition.

00:01:46.405 --> 00:01:51.226
And the poor are another style,
labour class and all that.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.930
So you have to bring them
to the centre. But how?

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.430
You, yourself have the depth within yourself.

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:04.589
You can pull of them together into this.

00:02:04.589 --> 00:02:07.089
First solution has to
come in the central path.

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.969
Alright?

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:14.789
So this is it, that, when you start doing your
philanthropic work, you cannot do it with Sahaja Yoga,

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.139
you cannot.

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:21.459
Of course, I mean poor is alright, in
the Indian villages, I can work it out.

00:02:21.495 --> 00:02:27.185
But very poor, they will not take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:27.245 --> 00:02:36.361
They'll take to drinking, smoking or if some
time is left, then burgling or cheating.

00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:41.631
They will take to these things, because
for them, eating is the main thing.

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:44.149
Just like animals they are.

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:49.206
And for the very rich, they
are another type of animal.

00:02:49.276 --> 00:02:51.776
They are vultures.

00:02:51.816 --> 00:02:56.606
They cannot live without being parasites.

00:02:56.657 --> 00:02:59.157
If you tell then anything,
they will not understand you.

00:02:59.157 --> 00:03:02.674
So, the upper class is useless and
the lower class is useless for us.

00:03:02.696 --> 00:03:09.986
Ours is the middle class, which has to
settle down with the values of Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:12.884 --> 00:03:16.080
And then once they see
you, the river flowing,

00:03:16.101 --> 00:03:21.380
they can be enriched and
they will come to us.

00:03:23.191 --> 00:03:31.624
You are like a river and we have to enrich
both the banks, this side or that side.

00:03:33.224 --> 00:03:35.264
That is important.

00:03:35.264 --> 00:03:42.144
One side you have to cleanse the upper class
and the lower class you have to enrich them.

00:03:42.164 --> 00:03:47.004
But if you do not have that within
yourselves, how are you going to do it?

00:03:47.497 --> 00:03:53.420
Sahaja Yoga is going to work for the
middle class. This is the point.

00:03:57.377 --> 00:03:59.217
Not for the poor and the greedy.

00:03:59.247 --> 00:04:02.471
And that's a very wrong thing to
do, attention is put to the poor

00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:06.533
That's not our job. We have
not created the poor. Have we?

00:04:06.533 --> 00:04:07.903
We have not.

00:04:07.903 --> 00:04:10.403
Who has created them?

00:04:10.403 --> 00:04:12.526
The upper class!

00:04:12.526 --> 00:04:16.853
We club them together, the
upper and lower class.

00:04:16.877 --> 00:04:20.313
So they say, "We will have
Labour government."

00:04:20.357 --> 00:04:22.857
Both are just the same!

00:04:30.847 --> 00:04:35.555
That's it you see. They say by
denying God, we are challenging God.

00:04:35.595 --> 00:04:40.444
If they deny God, then God will fall at
their feet. That is why they deny God.

00:04:40.444 --> 00:04:42.325
Otherwise, what is the need?

00:04:42.325 --> 00:04:45.545
What matters? Is he
standing for any election?

00:04:45.555 --> 00:04:51.483
Is he contesting any election that you are saying,"We
do not believe in God?" What does it matter?

00:04:55.963 --> 00:05:01.073
So that is what we understand
that these are fools.

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:03.619
Is there any way, Mother that...?

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:10.072
That's what I said that, the way is that the middle
class, you see, the middle class should be developed.

00:05:10.072 --> 00:05:16.220
all these people who are on the extremes like
they say, I do not believe and I am angry."

00:05:17.541 --> 00:05:20.041
Then let it be. You don't make them believe.

00:05:20.041 --> 00:05:25.068
Yes, but is there any way of helping them to
come to an understanding in the beginning?

00:05:25.108 --> 00:05:32.578
You see, if you think that you can make these
people believe, you cannot. It's wrong.

00:05:32.578 --> 00:05:38.888
They will not. They will not, because the more you will try to
do it, the more they'll continue, you see their ego is hurt.

00:05:38.888 --> 00:05:42.418
They are the people whose ego is hurt,
because they find some people rich. You see.

00:05:43.533 --> 00:05:47.881
Say, the person on this bank and on
this bank: he sees this, he sees this.

00:05:47.898 --> 00:05:50.398
We are somewhere down below here, alright?

00:05:50.398 --> 00:05:55.121
And they are seeing each other.
So their ego is hurt very much.

00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:57.621
And here there are people
who are egotistical.

00:05:57.621 --> 00:06:02.088
So both do not believe in God. What
does it matter if the believe it or not?

00:06:02.111 --> 00:06:04.611
There is God.

00:06:07.043 --> 00:06:11.943
You see they just want to say it out. Here
is, a big words! I have seen everybody.

00:06:11.993 --> 00:06:14.576
"I believe..." Now, who are you?

00:06:14.658 --> 00:06:19.433
Everyone says, "I believe into..." I
mean believing from where it has come?

00:06:21.413 --> 00:06:25.162
From where did you get this
belief? What is your experience?

00:06:25.443 --> 00:06:27.943
So that's how they do it.

00:06:28.853 --> 00:06:34.843
So they have to say, if a politician comes up and
gives a lecture. "I believe that this is this."

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.553
So everybody hears that, so they go on
home. They say, "I believe in this!"

00:06:39.553 --> 00:06:46.490
This is like ringing one bell, putting into another bell
and the resonance starts and everyone says, "I believe."

00:06:46.503 --> 00:06:51.573
You see, I find in this country, even
an ordinary beggar talks like that!

00:06:56.652 --> 00:06:58.882
There's no humility of any kind.

00:06:58.882 --> 00:07:04.322
That's why they talk like
that. They lack all humility.

00:07:04.355 --> 00:07:07.805
They are so aggressive. You just
see how aggressive they are.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.555
They have aggressed all the cultures of the world.

00:07:09.555 --> 00:07:12.055
Now today's article, I brought
it for you to see especially.

00:07:12.055 --> 00:07:15.125
You see now, in say, Tehran,

00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:17.305
whatever they have done,
Tehranis have done,

00:07:17.305 --> 00:07:20.766
they have put a chaddar on a lady
and say,"You wear a chaddar."

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:29.383
So an English lady writes about it. She
says, "They have made our body...."

00:07:29.415 --> 00:07:33.853
You see now, your attitude towards life, you can say
a British attitude or you can say a Western attitude

00:07:33.923 --> 00:07:37.023
is that your body is very
beautiful, so you must show it.

00:07:37.043 --> 00:07:39.898
Why? Why cheat yourself?

00:07:39.926 --> 00:07:44.688
It is not because your body is beautiful that
you are showing it off, but you want to catch it.

00:07:44.738 --> 00:07:47.748
It's simple.

00:07:47.768 --> 00:07:50.868
It is as simple as that.Face it!

00:07:50.878 --> 00:07:55.208
But you want all the world, all over
the world, the women should be like you.

00:07:59.738 --> 00:08:01.674
It's such a subtle
aggression. You don't know.

00:08:01.674 --> 00:08:08.694
They have killed all the cultures of the world with
this kind of an understanding that, "We are the best!"

00:08:08.694 --> 00:08:13.350
Most educated and sophisticated people.

00:08:17.229 --> 00:08:21.940
But others also must exist. They have their
own cultures, understand them and think.

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:27.316
If you do not say, "Please, give
me this," then he is uncultured.

00:08:32.375 --> 00:08:38.184
You know, it is such a subtle
aggression on everybody's culture.

00:08:38.205 --> 00:08:42.834
That's how you have removed all the Indians
from say South America and North America.

00:08:42.884 --> 00:08:48.514
You see, everywhere, wherever these people
have gone they have finished the culture.

00:08:51.172 --> 00:08:59.492
It's a very, very special type of aggression these
people have and aggression has a reaction always.

00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:08.621
Either the other culture's people, those people who have other cultures, would strive to be this culture, because this is supposed to be the greatest of all.

00:09:08.665 --> 00:09:15.228
To say like that, that, "We should not be afraid
of showing, we should not be ashamed of our body."

00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:18.688
What is something like privacy within us?

00:09:18.708 --> 00:09:26.058
Is there nothing like privacy?
We should respect our bodies!

00:09:28.868 --> 00:09:31.968
Now if this is the attitude taken, that everybody

00:09:32.002 --> 00:09:36.699
"Oh, this woman is inhibited because
she does not show off her body."

00:09:36.726 --> 00:09:42.639
The showing off of the body is nothing
but ... It is a subtle prostitution!

00:09:45.864 --> 00:09:48.164
You see it's on and on and on.

00:09:48.164 --> 00:09:51.924
It's very subtle. Now another
suggestion comes in from there that,

00:09:51.922 --> 00:09:58.784
for twenty five years they cannot believe that people can
remain celibate because in this country people cannot.

00:10:00.887 --> 00:10:06.397
but there are so many countries where they
really remain celibate till they are married;

00:10:06.427 --> 00:10:08.989
so many of them.

00:10:10.021 --> 00:10:16.541
but according to them it is not possible, so those
who remain must be wrong. They are telling lies.

00:10:16.541 --> 00:10:20.145
And they force this on others
that, "You come like us only!

00:10:20.155 --> 00:10:24.755
Because our noses are cut,
so you also cut your noses."

00:10:29.656 --> 00:10:30.916
On all types of people

00:10:30.916 --> 00:10:35.789
if you go anywhere, all the Western people,
what they have ruined is the culture,

00:10:35.841 --> 00:10:41.269
it is the variety of culture. And such subtle
cultures they have reduced to nothing!

00:10:41.303 --> 00:10:49.703
And by their aggression they have told people
that, "We are (supposedly) the highest of highest.

00:10:49.723 --> 00:10:53.684
English language you must know! You
must know French! You must know this!"

00:11:00.482 --> 00:11:02.982
Don't open this door.

00:11:03.013 --> 00:11:07.673
So, you see what I am saying is when
we understand, we have to change.

00:11:07.743 --> 00:11:09.863
We must know we have to be really humble.

00:11:09.893 --> 00:11:13.046
Not in language, not in behaviour but inside.

00:11:13.108 --> 00:11:16.426
To know that we do not
aggress others. Alright?

00:11:16.442 --> 00:11:22.100
So this Labour has this one
problem, is only of aggression.

00:11:23.119 --> 00:11:26.524
One community here, you take example.

00:11:26.564 --> 00:11:29.620
Now, say you take an example, so called elite.

00:11:29.668 --> 00:11:33.650
That's why I liked Evita, they have
made a big satire on all the elites.

00:11:33.677 --> 00:11:41.530
The dancing how they do. They have made a satire on all the upper classes and all the lower classes and all that type.

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:44.687
It's a very good one, I must say.
It's a very good satire. Evita!

00:11:44.687 --> 00:11:47.049
It's a very good satire ever since long.

00:11:47.049 --> 00:11:54.597
So, now, if you have that aggression within
you existing, then better take it out.

00:11:58.384 --> 00:12:03.638
The culture of the Spirit has to
come in you. That has to be there.

00:12:03.668 --> 00:12:11.430
If that culture doesn't come, then
these all cultures are very aggressive,

00:12:11.444 --> 00:12:16.269
and they can never give
any happiness to anyone.

00:12:16.419 --> 00:12:23.257
Labour people think that they are hurt by the
elites, or by the rich or the upper class.

00:12:23.262 --> 00:12:25.467
But what are they aspiring to be?

00:12:25.494 --> 00:12:29.327
They're aspiring to be the rich people themselves!

00:12:32.228 --> 00:12:34.898
They are hurt by the rich
and they want to be the rich.

00:12:34.898 --> 00:12:38.878
It would be like, if you were hurt by
somebody's shoes, you become the shoe itself.

00:12:41.219 --> 00:12:43.989
It you are hurt by the rich people,
then why do you want to be rich?

00:12:43.989 --> 00:12:50.898
It's a simple question. For a person like me
who has no materialism, I cannot understand it.

00:12:50.898 --> 00:12:54.919
Shri Mataji can I say something
about our political system?

00:12:57.509 --> 00:12:58.319
Yes.

00:12:58.394 --> 00:13:02.054
It was set up on the threes gunas,
you have radicals who are Rajas,

00:13:02.079 --> 00:13:10.283
Conservatives who are Tamas and you have in the middle the Liberals who are Sattva, intelligence. And what you are saying is right....

00:13:10.295 --> 00:13:14.615
But I tell you Liberals also need
Realisation! They are to be reborn.

00:13:14.615 --> 00:13:19.345
Otherwise you will have one horrible Jeremy
Thorpe. Why did you give him anywhere a seat?

00:13:19.349 --> 00:13:24.765
You gave him a seat. Why should you give a seat? You
should have courage to say, "Better not be there."

00:13:24.774 --> 00:13:26.195
He has got a seat!

00:13:26.195 --> 00:13:28.904
He is going back for it.

00:13:28.918 --> 00:13:30.255
Ahh?

00:13:30.274 --> 00:13:33.665
He's going back to his seat. He's
standing for his seat again.

00:13:33.695 --> 00:13:36.385
But what I'm saying......

00:13:41.016 --> 00:13:45.965
No, no, but it's only after you see? But I tell you what.

00:13:45.946 --> 00:13:51.089
You see, unless and until they take
to realisation, it will not work.

00:13:51.149 --> 00:13:54.779
I told David Steel about Mataji,
I told David Steel about Mataji.

00:13:54.795 --> 00:14:00.329
You see, what I'm saying: just by proposing
that you are in the centre, you do not become.

00:14:00.372 --> 00:14:04.870
"Sahaja, Sahaja," you see, Kabira has
said it: "Sahaja, Sahaja, saba karata."

00:14:04.877 --> 00:14:09.263
"They all say Sahaja, Sahaja, but they are not!"

00:14:09.313 --> 00:14:13.610
You should be ashamed of such a
horrible leader you had for so many days.

00:14:13.653 --> 00:14:18.120
Jeremy Thorpe? Well he's
better than some we've had.

00:14:18.126 --> 00:14:24.366
No, no horrible he is! You just see
vibrations. Horrible person he is!

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.406
No!

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:27.306
No, no, no, all of them are just the same.

00:14:27.306 --> 00:14:32.324
To me all of them are just the same. There is
nothing to choose. But if you have a choice...

00:14:32.324 --> 00:14:39.844
You see, England: we aren't an aggressive nation and I
don't like you saying that we are an aggressive nation!

00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:46.715
No, no. You are not aggressive
when it comes to something else.

00:14:46.775 --> 00:14:49.275
But when it comes to cultures, you do like this.

00:14:49.275 --> 00:14:54.072
Well we are uneducated, I admit. When we came
to India we didn't know what we were doing,

00:14:54.072 --> 00:14:57.532
so we cut off from it and we wouldn't
have anything to do with it.

00:14:57.552 --> 00:15:04.301
What English brought from India? Pyjamas! Jodhpurs! Verandahs!

00:15:04.392 --> 00:15:05.461
The sun dial!

00:15:05.461 --> 00:15:09.601
And what else did you buy? So, you
are aggressive that way. You see?

00:15:09.601 --> 00:15:11.161
So all these things have to be changed.

00:15:11.161 --> 00:15:15.365
Like Indians must change and they should
not accept whatever you give them.

00:15:16.102 --> 00:15:23.242
Our aim of being in India was not an
aggressive one. And we weren't aggressive!

00:15:23.268 --> 00:15:23.822
In India?

00:15:23.822 --> 00:15:26.822
I don't like hearing these things!

00:15:26.833 --> 00:15:32.452
You may not like it, but we have had it!! You see , you
don't know how they treated us. You have no idea Simon.

00:15:32.502 --> 00:15:37.721
When I go to India, why do they say, Victoria Rani?"

00:15:38.955 --> 00:15:44.981
I want to know why in India they
say, "Oh we want Rani back."

00:15:45.001 --> 00:15:48.275
Arey! If you pay money to someone!

00:15:48.305 --> 00:15:52.915
Well I've met Indians who like Germans for kicking
us out, because without the second world war....

00:15:52.915 --> 00:15:57.763
No, no, I'll tell you very simple.
Just Simon, Simon. Listen, listen.

00:15:57.818 --> 00:16:03.503
I shall tell you. You will understand if you listen Very simple.
It is very simple. It's a poor country.

00:16:03.559 --> 00:16:10.589
You gave them money, they can sell you anything. They have kitaabs and they gave these... we never had these...

00:16:10.589 --> 00:16:17.491
Like they called somebody.. What do you
call that? All these M.A.D PhD's and all that,

00:16:17.518 --> 00:16:22.431
Ahh.... Titles! They gave titles and
they gave this and that.

00:16:22.456 --> 00:16:30.432
You know, English know how to do it. And they
collected some people to say something about it.

00:16:30.502 --> 00:16:34.593
But the way they had to fight it out, you don't
know. You don't know. You were not there.

00:16:34.648 --> 00:16:37.148
Have you seen Satyajit Ray's
film 'The Chess Players?'

00:16:37.148 --> 00:16:41.789
Have you seen Satya Ray's...? Satyajit
Ray is the best filmmaker in India.

00:16:41.824 --> 00:16:46.729
That's what you people think, because
he tells all about our poverty!

00:16:46.765 --> 00:16:50.105
He doesn't know anything about
Indian culture, not a word.

00:16:50.105 --> 00:16:53.145
He doesn't know anything about
spirituality; Satyaji Ray.

00:16:53.145 --> 00:16:58.355
He's alright, people like him because
he sings the saga of communism.

00:16:58.396 --> 00:17:03.036
That's why people like him. That's
not India! He never represents India.

00:17:03.071 --> 00:17:10.066
It's alright, he is very good at getting very old people
from somewhere showing all their ribs and stomachs.

00:17:12.356 --> 00:17:22.936
That's how he does and people like it, because there is a kind of sadism; we like to see the poverty. We like to see some people being tortured, because we feel we are tortured.

00:17:23.046 --> 00:17:29.840
It's very subtle Simon, I tell you. You are
a different person. You cannot understand it.

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:32.030
But now you are different.

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:37.250
I'm not talking about the people who came to India,
but I am saying today also as the Western mind is.

00:17:37.256 --> 00:17:46.399
You see with your rationality, with your so called scholarship, that you have

00:17:46.439 --> 00:17:50.449
the so called, we can say industrial...

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:56.720
Indians these days go overboard for
Bertrand Russell... Lichtenstein.. and

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:57.970
That's what I'm saying.

00:17:57.971 --> 00:18:02.150
You see, this is what I'm saying! The same thing
as you are saying, I am saying the same thing.

00:18:02.197 --> 00:18:07.773
You are giving them and they are taking
it, whether it is poison or anything.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:11.710
This is what I am saying. They
are another kind of fool.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.270
You are one type, they are another type.

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:16.770
You see, you aggress them and they take it.

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:19.270
If anything goes from
India, they will accept it.

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:26.420
If anything goes from England, they will
accept it! It's a funny thing going on.

00:18:26.457 --> 00:18:29.035
But we get all these fake gurus, who've come from India.

00:18:29.065 --> 00:18:33.985
Yes that is what I'm saying. You take
from them, they are another sect.

00:18:34.025 --> 00:18:36.525
They are sending some gurus
for you. You accept them!

00:18:36.525 --> 00:18:43.855
And this is the mutual understanding going
on. There's a big fraternity of thugs.

00:18:43.878 --> 00:18:47.885
After all, you built a fantastic
Wembley building for them.

00:18:49.183 --> 00:18:54.993
See now! You see the joke. Whole thing! Once you say
that, "We are the British." You are gone. Finished there!

00:18:54.995 --> 00:18:58.423
You just say, "We are human beings,"
and then you can see the whole joke.

00:18:58.423 --> 00:19:01.873
If I say, "I am an Indian," I'm gone, finished.

00:19:02.719 --> 00:19:04.492
It's not a political thing.

00:19:04.492 --> 00:19:06.359
See, it's not politically. It's much higher.

00:19:06.349 --> 00:19:10.669
You see, you don't identify yourself with
any group and then you can see the joke.

00:19:10.694 --> 00:19:12.909
If you identify, then you cannot.

00:19:12.932 --> 00:19:19.144
You don't have to take it literally. You have to
take the essence of what Shri Mataji is saying.

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:20.434
If you listen, take the essence.

00:19:20.434 --> 00:19:24.584
No, no, no! If you listen to me, the whole thing you will
understand it, very clearly, what I am trying to say.

00:19:24.584 --> 00:19:30.694
Don't get angry! When I am saying
aggression is there. Aggression is the...

00:19:30.731 --> 00:19:38.637
You see, what I do not understand
that people do not study others

00:19:38.637 --> 00:19:46.626
and just bring about your own ideas
onto another, That's great aggression.

00:19:46.676 --> 00:19:51.512
Now, in my own house, my two daughters are
there. I have not told them what is kundalini!

00:19:51.572 --> 00:19:53.582
Can you believe it?

00:19:55.469 --> 00:19:58.540
Can you believe it?

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:04.260
Even not told them what is kundalini,
leave alone giving Realisation.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.424
Same with my husband!

00:20:06.574 --> 00:20:11.158
If they do not want it, I am not going
to agress. This is non aggression.

00:20:16.326 --> 00:20:20.381
But that doesn't mean I
accept aggression from them.

00:20:21.143 --> 00:20:26.474
So when you accept aggression is the same
as to give aggression, if you do aggression

00:20:26.481 --> 00:20:29.894
For me both things are just the same.

00:20:29.921 --> 00:20:34.894
So when we have to change ourselves,
we should say,"What do we do?"

00:20:36.933 --> 00:20:42.597
"Where are we?" "Are we aggressing
others or are we taking aggression?"

00:20:42.647 --> 00:20:45.667
Now, say Atul feels guilty, then
he's taking in aggression.

00:20:47.868 --> 00:20:52.748
If you feel like egotistical way that, "This is wrong.
That is wrong" Then you are aggressing others.

00:20:52.783 --> 00:21:00.573
All these things must be seen in it's full context and in
the full view of the whole thing, so you will understand.

00:21:00.573 --> 00:21:04.623
But what happens? We identify
ourselves with one part of life.

00:21:04.667 --> 00:21:09.897
We say, "This is the thing." And either we
aggress others in that case or we take aggression.

00:21:11.007 --> 00:21:14.755
This is sickness. This is the sign of sickness.

00:21:14.776 --> 00:21:17.035
Anytime this happens, sickness starts.

00:21:17.035 --> 00:21:24.232
And this is the cause of sickness of
all the human beings all over the world.

00:21:26.513 --> 00:21:32.910
But once you identify yourself with the whole, then you start seeing the whole thing as a diseased thing.

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:36.550
And then you feel... treating
that disease as a doctor

00:21:36.574 --> 00:21:41.091
Then you do not identify
yourself with any sickness.

00:21:41.194 --> 00:21:45.754
Alright? That is what means 'Sahaja' life is.

00:21:47.061 --> 00:21:49.561
So now, if you have somebody sick...

00:21:49.561 --> 00:21:53.551
Alright, so now you understand,

00:21:53.591 --> 00:21:56.091
that by helping that particular person...

00:21:56.124 --> 00:22:01.015
Of course, it is your desire it will be
done, because you are one with the whole.

00:22:01.046 --> 00:22:06.106
But the approach towards that sickness is different.

00:22:06.146 --> 00:22:08.016
Do you understand my point?

00:22:08.016 --> 00:22:13.175
It's one way to help because he's
sick, he's poor, is different.

00:22:13.265 --> 00:22:19.149
What I'm saying: the approach should be that
we become absolutely confident of Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:19.149 --> 00:22:22.655
We establish our own powers. Absolutely!

00:22:22.655 --> 00:22:26.225
And then we make them the same,
because they will fall sick.

00:22:26.288 --> 00:22:30.378
They'll have all problems, unless
and until they are alright.

00:22:30.392 --> 00:22:36.005
So that is the primary thing that must be done.

00:22:36.524 --> 00:22:38.918
Because,

00:22:38.948 --> 00:22:43.296
on one side they are the
people whose ego is hurt.

00:22:43.316 --> 00:22:47.681
the other side are the people who
have been suffering from their egos.

00:22:47.719 --> 00:22:51.337
If you have to help both of them,
you have to bring them in the centre.

00:22:51.347 --> 00:22:53.727
Alright? Do you understand my point now?

00:22:53.757 --> 00:22:59.017
Now, to bring them in the centre
is not to sort of appease them

00:22:59.077 --> 00:23:02.877
Not that way. But by
developing the centre.

00:23:02.927 --> 00:23:11.737
You see, let the centre grow first, on both the sides,
so it engulfs all that. Do you understand Maria?

00:23:11.789 --> 00:23:14.289
Yes, Mother.

00:23:15.227 --> 00:23:19.756
They will never believe in God, because
that is the way they can assert their ego.

00:23:23.218 --> 00:23:29.086
Indians are another set of fools, absolutely set of
fools, because the way they're following you people.

00:23:29.086 --> 00:23:32.576
I mean you are already in the
ditch, where are they going?

00:23:34.899 --> 00:23:40.198
Firstly they do not have any values about
honesty about them. That's finished.

00:23:40.238 --> 00:23:46.198
Now, even if they are getting the other values also from
you, then these sickly people, where will they be?

00:23:47.204 --> 00:23:48.904
As it is they are theives.

00:23:48.904 --> 00:23:54.084
When a thief becomes an immoral
person, now what will happen to him?

00:23:54.104 --> 00:23:59.634
It's like somebody has
been bitten by a scorpion

00:23:59.643 --> 00:24:05.972
and on top of that he takes wine,
then what happens to such a person?

00:24:11.978 --> 00:24:15.728
So the aggression is within,
which is to be corrected.

00:24:15.738 --> 00:24:22.528
For all Realised Souls, it is important to
see if we are taking any aggression within us

00:24:22.546 --> 00:24:25.498
is equally wrong as giving aggression.

00:24:29.779 --> 00:24:45.122
You see, we have to develop a set of people who have idea of 'Reality,' those who understand what is 'Reality.'

00:24:45.208 --> 00:24:53.653
Those who are going to set in another type of
way, which will cut down this vicious circle.

00:24:55.970 --> 00:25:08.877
We have to have that kind of mind, by which we see
the disease of the whole and try to correct it.

00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:14.100
That's how we can manage.

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:19.620
but if you start identifying, even today I would
say, with any one of them, you are mistaken.

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:21.510
Now you understand my point?

00:25:21.543 --> 00:25:24.510
You just don't identify with any one of them!

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:32.346
You have to identify yourself with 'Reality,' with
your 'Self.' To begin with! When you become that...

00:25:33.832 --> 00:25:35.061
Nirguna!

00:25:35.061 --> 00:25:37.521
Not necessarily nirguna!

00:25:37.561 --> 00:25:41.621
You start with saguna only. Because
I am in saguna, what to do?

00:25:42.885 --> 00:25:46.001
If you do not come in
saguna... saguna is 'with forms.'

00:25:46.035 --> 00:25:49.125
If you do not come in the form, nobody
understands, who will talk to you?

00:25:49.125 --> 00:25:51.625
A Nirguna cannot talk to you.

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:01.080
So the Saguna had to come.Alright!

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:10.406
Now you establish within yourself the
complete understanding of the saguna.

00:26:13.133 --> 00:26:18.397
Now don't doubt too much. If you are a doubting Thomas,
you will end up with zero! I can tell you this much.

00:26:18.447 --> 00:26:24.020
We have had people for years together. There is one gentleman coming for seven years and you know him, and nothing could be done.

00:26:24.067 --> 00:26:29.031
And he supposed to be a wrangler in mathematics!

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:37.010
So, you must see the people who have understood
the saguna and how far they have gone.

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:44.475
And if you are to progress, you try
to understand it now, first of all.

00:26:45.715 --> 00:26:48.215
Secondly, you must also understand,

00:26:48.215 --> 00:26:56.708
that you are going to be the people who are going
to lead the whole world into a new awareness,

00:26:56.708 --> 00:27:00.033
into a new life, into a new dimension!

00:27:03.633 --> 00:27:08.060
So don't identify with people who
are still blind, who do not see.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.600
They'll make you more blind.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:21.888
Identify yourself with people
who have seen something.

00:27:24.028 --> 00:27:27.107
The ones who have had
experiences, you identify.

00:27:27.148 --> 00:27:32.308
Put your attention to them,
then only you can see.

00:27:35.822 --> 00:27:42.138
And that is only possible when you
start giving up your misidentifications.

00:27:50.198 --> 00:27:55.254
As long as you have
misidentifications, you will be mad!

00:27:55.285 --> 00:27:57.894
You would not know what to do about it.

00:27:57.922 --> 00:28:00.422
That's sickness!

00:28:01.402 --> 00:28:05.452
You got involved into these identifications gradually.

00:28:05.479 --> 00:28:11.602
You see, because the atmosphere is like
that, the whole surrounding is like that.

00:28:11.644 --> 00:28:15.149
From all sides you have
people who just engulfed you.

00:28:15.156 --> 00:28:16.899
They club you into it!

00:28:16.899 --> 00:28:20.319
You have to jolly well come in
to it! Your freedom is cut off.

00:28:20.356 --> 00:28:22.856
You are not free to think about it.

00:28:28.512 --> 00:28:31.929
And that's how you are not
free from misidentifications.

00:28:31.983 --> 00:28:39.878
To begin with you were alright, but gradually you started getting enveloped and identified with your mistakes.

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:44.320
How are you responsible for what your
forefathers have done in this country,

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.820
or my forefathers have done in my country?

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:54.902
Tell me. Who are they to you? They might have been born in China now with chinky eyes.

00:28:59.179 --> 00:29:07.389
Or could be in Rye (?), or could be running
away with Amin as his soldiers. Could be anywhere!

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:09.920
And we are not responsible for
them, whatever they have done.

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.420
Alright? Keep it at that point.

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:22.124
Now, if you feel responsible, say even
for anyone who belongs to your tribe,

00:29:22.177 --> 00:29:26.364
still it's wrong, because you are different people.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:40.060
When you become that, then you must identify yourself with the new tribe, one who has known 'Reality.'

00:29:43.698 --> 00:29:48.958
But human beings identify very easily
with something so much illusory:

00:29:48.958 --> 00:29:55.170
like if you are born in England you are English,
if you are born in India, you are Indian.

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:57.810
You could have been born
in Singapore or any place!

00:30:01.342 --> 00:30:05.536
These all misidentifications create this problem in you.

00:30:05.554 --> 00:30:11.360
Then with this identifications also,
you go into that... complete circles.

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:17.570
If you are an Indian, you start speaking
like an Indian: all the good and bad of it.

00:30:17.638 --> 00:30:22.216
Same with English, same with
French, same with everything.

00:30:22.235 --> 00:30:28.249
You see, gradually you start misidentification.
Missidentification starts working in you.

00:30:29.005 --> 00:30:35.481
But you are the pure thing inside.
These all impurities cover you.

00:30:35.488 --> 00:30:44.401
So to free yourself from all these impurities, of
any kind. I tell you this is like possession in you.

00:30:46.045 --> 00:30:53.665
To be free absolutely of all
these things is the ultimate aim.

00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:59.730
So, all these ideas, when they come into your head,

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:08.660
please remember that all these have come to
us because we belong to a particular society,

00:31:08.703 --> 00:31:11.430
a particular caste or religion.

00:31:11.463 --> 00:31:17.440
Now, for example, the other day, you know, there was a
gentleman who said, "I feel very guilty all the time."

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.940
So I said, "Are you a Catholic?" He said, "No."

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:24.273
So I said, "You have no business to feel guilty!"

00:31:24.323 --> 00:31:28.693
Because if you are a Catholic, you
are made to feel guilty all the time.

00:31:30.094 --> 00:31:38.064
It's a collective you see. Just from childhood if somebody gets a brain wash all the time, a little child doesn't understand.

00:31:38.124 --> 00:31:41.435
You go on telling him, "You are a sinner." He said, "No?"

00:31:41.445 --> 00:31:43.895
You go on telling him, he'll say, "Am I a sinner?"

00:31:43.896 --> 00:31:48.526
Then he goes to church. Then they tell, "You are a sinner."

00:31:48.536 --> 00:31:50.986
You must confess.

00:31:51.064 --> 00:31:53.564
"Repent, repent repent!"

00:31:54.654 --> 00:31:57.154
Repent, repent. Now he says,
"What should I repent?"

00:31:57.154 --> 00:32:04.424
So he thinks about it, he goes to the priest
and he tells him that, "I repent for one thing."

00:32:04.494 --> 00:32:06.054
He said, "What?"

00:32:06.084 --> 00:32:08.584
"Because I opened the tap."

00:32:08.584 --> 00:32:14.556
He said, "What?" "I opened the tap and my
mother scolded me for that. I repent for that."

00:32:14.559 --> 00:32:20.966
So, it starts from there, you see, and
the whole thing starts working out.

00:32:20.993 --> 00:32:23.980
Then poor thing repents for something else.

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:29.550
But inside, when he's repenting, he's building up a pouch.

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:40.703
And that's how these horrible people, so called Christians or so called Hindus, all of them just the same.

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:46.262
But I am saying about these, how
they have gone against Christ.

00:32:46.262 --> 00:32:50.000
There's one thing he taught is non-aggression.

00:32:52.686 --> 00:32:56.562
You make somebody feel
guilty and you have it!

00:33:00.121 --> 00:33:02.163
Absolutely satanic!

00:33:02.163 --> 00:33:07.543
Is there any mention in the Bible, that
Christ wanted somebody to confess to him?

00:33:09.474 --> 00:33:11.974
Where did he mention by any chance.

00:33:11.974 --> 00:33:12.490
No.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:19.994
Then why these people have started this confession business? And who are they, compared to Christ, that they ask for confessions?

00:33:20.034 --> 00:33:27.990
Appointed by some theological college! Elected by some people where the smoke comes out of the chimney!

00:33:31.122 --> 00:33:36.882
All of these silly things you
digest without thinking about it.

00:33:37.718 --> 00:33:42.318
and then you are misidentified also Maria. Alright?

00:33:42.344 --> 00:33:49.086
So you must understand. Be happy and joyous that
you have found the Eternal Life and be one with it.

00:33:51.076 --> 00:33:52.067
I will Mother.

00:33:52.067 --> 00:33:55.377
Alright. And you tell them off
that, "You are all silly fools.

00:33:55.479 --> 00:34:01.193
And you go ahead with your idiocity! And when
you are absolutely drowned, then come to us!"

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:09.663
I used to do that until they strangled me. That's when
you found me Mother and you pulled me out of that.

00:34:09.663 --> 00:34:16.270
That's what I used to say to spiritualist.
I used to tell them what I thought of them.

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:18.810
But why? You see , a spiritualist whom are they?

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:21.310
Do you know who indulges?
All these poor things.

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:26.737
Same in India! They have all these horrible tantrikas, this, that.

00:34:26.737 --> 00:34:31.530
As long as we involve it... I you see
there are countries like, you can say

00:34:31.575 --> 00:34:34.700
aah, say aah,

00:34:34.715 --> 00:34:38.860
tantrikas are mostly prevalent in Bengal, in Bihar,

00:34:38.884 --> 00:34:47.604
in UP., in Kerala, in Madras, Assam.

00:34:47.637 --> 00:34:57.707
And there you find the poverty! And maximum
are in Bihar, which is the poorest of all!

00:35:01.501 --> 00:35:09.181
I mean the absurdity of these people: that
place that we went to, Kovalam, is in Kerala.

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:14.811
The people are extremely poor and
for the newspaper people, you see,

00:35:14.811 --> 00:35:17.311
this is the main issue they have; that poverty.

00:35:17.311 --> 00:35:22.269
They want to sort of take advantage of their
poverty. As if they are very poor, live like poor.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:28.327
And these people arranged my programme in a hall,
a big hall and it was a carpet or something,

00:35:28.327 --> 00:35:29.517
I don't know what it is.

00:35:29.517 --> 00:35:33.977
So they published that she was living
in suites of rooms with.. what is it?

00:35:33.997 --> 00:35:34.517
Wall to wall

00:35:34.517 --> 00:35:38.383
wall to wall carpet and
this nonsense, you see!

00:35:38.463 --> 00:35:41.535
I was, poor thing, living with these people!

00:35:41.523 --> 00:35:47.535
But why? Because they wanted to imply that
she lives in luxury or whatever it is.

00:35:47.535 --> 00:35:51.615
I live always in luxury whether I am poor
or rich. Makes no difference to me.

00:35:51.646 --> 00:35:57.592
So, this is what is the accent they had. But
why there is poverty, why don't they think?

00:35:57.592 --> 00:36:01.386
Do you know, in that country,
such a wretched condition is,

00:36:01.426 --> 00:36:06.416
that Shri Shankaracharya
was born in that country,

00:36:06.449 --> 00:36:11.176
and these people told me that,
"We do not know who he was

00:36:11.219 --> 00:36:15.139
and also we do not know that
he was born in this country."

00:36:15.189 --> 00:36:18.029
They should be ashamed of themselves!

00:36:18.659 --> 00:36:21.159
And the second thing that they did

00:36:21.159 --> 00:36:23.659
that they tortured him

00:36:23.659 --> 00:36:26.159
because when he came back,
when his mother was sick,

00:36:26.159 --> 00:36:28.640
they would no even give him water.

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:32.970
They said, "You are a sanyasi, you have no
business to come here, to your mother."

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:37.521
And they would not, when she
died, they would not burn her.

00:36:37.561 --> 00:36:43.771
So, he burnt her in the house itself and he used all these... aah

00:36:50.586 --> 00:36:57.560
Banana. Banana tree to burn her off... to burn her off.

00:36:57.670 --> 00:37:04.964
And then he cursed that country that, "The way I have been...I have burned my mother, you will be doing the same."

00:37:04.994 --> 00:37:10.363
So now they cannot burn. So what they do, they dig the graves and put them just in front of their houses.

00:37:10.383 --> 00:37:17.291
So imagine every house is hovered over by all
the thousands of horrible people who are dead!

00:37:17.391 --> 00:37:22.981
We went to one village and asked the
condition of the people. They all ran out!

00:37:22.958 --> 00:37:24.721
They said, "Oh God!" Ask Rustom!

00:37:24.721 --> 00:37:28.309
They said, "Mother, what sort of village is this?"

00:37:28.651 --> 00:37:33.368
And then you talk of emancipating
these horrible, nonsensical people!

00:37:36.772 --> 00:37:39.272
Why should God do that?

00:37:41.772 --> 00:37:45.262
They want to run after the tantrikas.

00:37:48.652 --> 00:37:55.592
Then the bhoots come in and how can you
have your problem of poverty solved?

00:37:55.633 --> 00:38:01.422
Tell me any country where there are so many bhoots and there is riches.

00:38:01.432 --> 00:38:06.662
Always you'll find the poor people
indulging into it than the rich!

00:38:06.682 --> 00:38:11.653
And once the rich start indulging
into it you'll also become.

00:38:12.472 --> 00:38:14.742
It's a very simple thing.

00:38:14.742 --> 00:38:19.992
I can understand if you people do not know,
but Indians know this, but still they do it.

00:38:20.064 --> 00:38:27.758
that, if there is one bhoot coming inside your
house, all the Lakshmi will be destroyed.

00:38:27.888 --> 00:38:32.109
Everyone knows this, but
still they do it in India.

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:41.788
There's no doubt Mother that the moment
you return to London the Left Agnya goes.

00:38:41.821 --> 00:38:46.258
And when you leave it you can feel it releasing.

00:38:46.258 --> 00:38:47.888
When I was in the plane I could feel...

00:38:47.928 --> 00:38:48.558
Ahh?

00:38:48.558 --> 00:38:53.278
When I was in the plane going to Germany I could feel
it release and when I was coming back it caught again.

00:38:53.313 --> 00:38:56.809
England is full of it.

00:38:57.009 --> 00:39:01.314
You see not use bringing up Labour
and Conservatives and all that.

00:39:01.322 --> 00:39:07.383
If they want to listen to me, destroy all these
tantrikas from here, one and all. You'll be alright.

00:39:07.417 --> 00:39:12.113
You try any trick.
You'll have problems.

00:39:13.953 --> 00:39:16.133
But who will listen to me?

00:39:16.153 --> 00:39:21.333
They used to believe in witches
and all that once upon a time.

00:39:21.493 --> 00:39:24.903
There used to be witch hunting and
all that, but they have stopped it.

00:39:24.964 --> 00:39:28.449
Now witches are very nicely
settled down in this country.

00:39:34.182 --> 00:39:36.682
Many Christians are witches Mother.

00:39:36.732 --> 00:39:39.232
Yes! So-called Christians!

00:39:39.276 --> 00:39:41.776
No, it doesn't mean that they are bad.

00:39:41.776 --> 00:39:48.324
They are not bad, but they are bad in a way,
because they bring all the bhoots from outside.

00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:54.179
No, they make the fields grow and we have to
keep witches here otherwise we'd get no harvest.

00:39:57.428 --> 00:40:04.124
Some bhoot is speaking through you. Some bhoot is speaking through you, you know

00:40:04.164 --> 00:40:05.738
I'm sorry, but I...

00:40:05.754 --> 00:40:10.808
Simon, you are correct, but you see,there is a witch in you that is speaking, you are not saying that.

00:40:10.816 --> 00:40:15.228
You see how can you say witches should be here when I have just told you all about them, what they do.

00:40:15.278 --> 00:40:18.988
Do you want people to suffer from poverty?

00:40:19.038 --> 00:40:24.616
Suffer from all kinds of mental diseases
and troubles? We don't want them here.

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:35.442
Do what you want. You do not know.

00:40:35.442 --> 00:40:38.392
First you find out what you
want, write it down and meditate.

00:40:38.392 --> 00:40:42.972
First of all you should get rid
of all these operations on you.

00:40:42.994 --> 00:40:45.494
See in your room itself, there's a problem;

00:40:45.494 --> 00:40:51.237
these witches are here around. All of
them are here. You must clear them.

00:40:51.267 --> 00:40:54.897
They all have to get out from this country.

00:40:54.922 --> 00:40:57.577
If by my coming here, if I cannot do even that much,

00:40:57.577 --> 00:41:01.259
then what's the use of my coming here?

00:41:02.117 --> 00:41:05.676
But it you are identified with
them, then what can I do about it?

00:41:05.697 --> 00:41:08.197
All the churches are doing that.

00:41:14.947 --> 00:41:20.005
As I have told you already that this
confession business is very wrong.

00:41:21.477 --> 00:41:27.487
Whatever is the problem of a particular country is
to be handled in that particular country, isn't it?

00:41:28.318 --> 00:41:31.218
In India also we have the same problem.

00:41:31.308 --> 00:41:39.528
But that's a very different type. I mean it is not regarded... You see, because it is not an organised religion, so I can wipe it out better, but it is organised here.

00:41:39.528 --> 00:41:49.473
The Seven Day Adventist, these another horrible Pentecostals, they are organised, they are accepted by law. They are doing all these things here through law!

00:41:49.503 --> 00:41:55.836
Mother, don't you think when they give you a sense
of being guilty in Christianity and Catholic Church,

00:41:55.836 --> 00:41:59.396
they're wanting at the same
time to increase their power?

00:41:59.396 --> 00:42:01.896
Of course! It's a play! It's a play!

00:42:01.896 --> 00:42:06.186
But only an intelligent
man can see that's true.

00:42:06.196 --> 00:42:10.716
You make somebody feel very guilty,
that is how they brainwash you!

00:42:10.754 --> 00:42:16.485
It's only brain washing. As
Hitler could brainwash Germans.

00:42:16.535 --> 00:42:19.035
these people have also brainwashed you.

00:42:19.035 --> 00:42:22.405
In India, also they do the
same thing - brainwashing!

00:42:23.435 --> 00:42:25.935
They have done all kinds of brainwashing,

00:42:25.935 --> 00:42:32.945
but the only difference is this, that
the Western religions are all organised.

00:42:32.982 --> 00:42:35.482
So when they are organised they become firm

00:42:35.482 --> 00:42:41.552
and they have much more power than
a religion which is disorganised.

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:44.080
You can hit them better!

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:51.750
Now the priest here is so much respected! In India a priest is not respected so much. Ask him, he is a Brahmin!

00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:55.940
You see if a priest comes into
your house we do not respect him.

00:42:55.980 --> 00:43:01.711
You see, he takes money, we know he takes money. We do not respect him the way here the priest is respected.

00:43:01.727 --> 00:43:07.842
Because it is organised. They have made their
norms and things by church, making some respect.

00:43:09.055 --> 00:43:17.150
What is terrible they gave the religion: and during the Middle Age they give to the Western countries knowledge.

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:19.079
religion and knowledge.

00:43:19.099 --> 00:43:22.493
They had incredible power.

00:43:22.525 --> 00:43:23.603
That's it!

00:43:23.609 --> 00:43:27.235
Because through the knowledge they
wanted to introduce the religion.

00:43:27.263 --> 00:43:30.629
And afterwards religion became to be knowledge.

00:43:31.573 --> 00:43:33.829
So the vicious circle starts.

00:43:34.029 --> 00:43:38.159
So you must decide it and you must give
up your misidentifications, first of all.

00:43:38.176 --> 00:43:42.796
Because all your diseases come
from your identifications.

00:43:42.802 --> 00:43:48.756
Alright? Say now you are Greek. Now Greeks also have
certain misidentifications, quite a lot of them.

00:43:48.798 --> 00:43:49.466
Many!

00:43:50.206 --> 00:43:55.246
So once you start becoming a Sahaja
Yogi or a universal personality,

00:43:55.246 --> 00:43:59.186
you just dissipate. You do not pamper.

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:01.846
But if you are a real Greek,

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:03.046
I never did.

00:44:03.043 --> 00:44:03.526
I know that.

00:44:03.526 --> 00:44:10.996
But if you are a real Greek, then you must tell all the other
Greeks also that, "This is what it is!" If you really love them.

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:16.210
I will be really please to say that to my aunts.

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:22.469
Your Aunt, I am not so much worried,
because that's an age now, they are gone.

00:44:22.513 --> 00:44:24.779
But what about the future that's coming up.

00:44:24.779 --> 00:44:30.649
Now the people who belong to such organised
religions, as they have, which has happened in India;

00:44:30.696 --> 00:44:33.461
(Unclear)

00:44:33.526 --> 00:44:39.494
in the same way it is going to happen here also, that they
are not going to believe in any religions whatsoever.

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:44.570
The other side has started as you
said! They don't believe in any God.

00:44:48.192 --> 00:44:49.972
I don't know what they need to find out.

00:44:50.002 --> 00:44:50.322
Ha?

00:44:50.362 --> 00:44:55.127
I don't really know what they need to find out.

00:44:55.168 --> 00:45:00.807
Nothing! You see, it's just a swing from one extreme
to another extreme. It's just extreme, that's all.

00:45:00.807 --> 00:45:03.307
There is no direction, there's no guidance.

00:45:03.307 --> 00:45:09.148
It's just a swing from believing into too
much, fanaticism, to another is non- belief!

00:45:09.177 --> 00:45:16.018
Or Sahaja Yoga is not like that at
all. Extremes, you know, extremes!

00:45:16.063 --> 00:45:20.234
so from one extreme and to another
extreme, they go just automatically.

00:45:20.275 --> 00:45:23.600
I mean it is absolutely inevitable.

00:45:25.503 --> 00:45:28.003
You have to stop in the centre.

00:45:28.003 --> 00:45:33.047
And those who are stopping must
grow, so they engulf all that.

00:45:33.108 --> 00:45:36.327
This is what I'm trying to tell you. Alright?

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:43.267
And then you'll start seeing them, then
you will know how horrible they are.

00:45:44.067 --> 00:45:45.155
It's very painful Mother.

00:45:45.155 --> 00:45:50.635
It's very painful to see how
horrible they are, it's true.

00:45:50.665 --> 00:45:52.588
We have to, of course, cure them.

00:45:52.615 --> 00:45:56.818
but first we should be alright, all of us
and we should pull all these things together.

00:45:56.818 --> 00:46:03.214
I don't know Mother, I've noticed that one of the way
that the negativity works is that it attacks people

00:46:03.227 --> 00:46:10.944
and then it makes you feel sorry for them and then it sucks all your energy, so that you have no chance to do any work for Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:10.988 --> 00:46:13.488
Like Rustom had this problem before,

00:46:13.488 --> 00:46:15.078
he was over sympathetic.

00:46:15.118 --> 00:46:20.924
If you have sympathies…if you see the meaning
’sympathy’ – it means ‘sharing pathos’.

00:46:20.954 --> 00:46:24.244
You share their pathos isn’t it!

00:46:24.297 --> 00:46:30.457
So this is also there. And now why, you see why I have
said this is that you have, in these Western countries,

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:34.527
you have seen the aggression of your forefathers
so you are taking to the other courses.

00:46:34.527 --> 00:46:37.917
You are over-sympathetic.

00:46:37.957 --> 00:46:42.227
And that thing is going to
tell against you, absolutely.

00:46:43.364 --> 00:46:45.607
There is nothing to sympathise.

00:46:45.607 --> 00:46:50.707
There is to be so strong, that you
just solve the problems like that.

00:46:50.754 --> 00:46:54.114
Sitting down here you should
be able to solve the problem.

00:46:56.064 --> 00:46:57.724
So develop your powers.

00:46:57.724 --> 00:47:01.734
Alright Simon? That’s what it is.
You must develop your powers.

00:47:01.774 --> 00:47:09.597
And how will you develop them is by becoming
silent and silent within and seeing for yourself.

00:47:09.637 --> 00:47:12.137
You have to just assume!

00:47:12.167 --> 00:47:14.327
You have powers already.

00:47:14.327 --> 00:47:17.537
You have been enriched by all the Adi Shakti.

00:47:17.562 --> 00:47:20.062
Everything has been done for you.

00:47:20.062 --> 00:47:25.675
You’ve got it. You are already
empowered. Just use that.

00:47:28.521 --> 00:47:32.164
Can you doubt that you are not empowered?

00:47:35.791 --> 00:47:42.659
You already have got powers and also
most of you know what is to be done.

00:47:45.411 --> 00:47:49.001
You know what is this power to be used for.

00:47:49.051 --> 00:47:51.980
You have the knowledge as well.

00:47:54.313 --> 00:47:58.271
But only thing is to assume it! You have to assume.

00:47:58.387 --> 00:48:00.487
We need the wisdom as well.

00:48:00.487 --> 00:48:04.017
You have! You don’t need Maria.

00:48:04.017 --> 00:48:08.397
You have a lot of it. Only thing
is don’t sympathise with them.

00:48:08.467 --> 00:48:14.075
Just don’t worry about them.
They are foolish people.

00:48:14.255 --> 00:48:16.755
This is what I have been doing all the time.

00:48:16.755 --> 00:48:23.525
That’s not proper. You don’t waste your energy on
that, that’s why you have thinned down so much.

00:48:26.115 --> 00:48:30.015
There’s a saying in Urdu, “Kazidli
bidli ka shayed kya deshakte”

00:48:30.015 --> 00:48:34.331
they say, “Priest, why are you so sick?
Because you are worried about the whole world”!

00:48:34.432 --> 00:48:35.975
(Break in recording.)

00:48:36.105 --> 00:48:37.185
Pay attention.

00:48:37.205 --> 00:48:40.655
 But your attention should be detached in that case. 

00:48:40.665 --> 00:48:44.245
If it is not a detached attention you cannot do that.

00:48:57.644 --> 00:49:03.325
It’s only one second you need.
You just say, “Go away all of you!

00:49:03.365 --> 00:49:04.541
Go away!

00:49:09.738 --> 00:49:15.402
So, you see for... we had an example
of that in Bombay, in Delhi.

00:49:15.402 --> 00:49:18.791
We had those Ramkrishna
mission people. Just tell them!

00:49:20.581 --> 00:49:26.881
There was a lady who had cancer from the same
ashram and she said, “Why? I was doing upkar

00:49:26.875 --> 00:49:30.801
I was helping others. I was looking after them.”

00:49:30.846 --> 00:49:33.806
I said, “Then why did you get cancer?”

00:49:33.806 --> 00:49:36.506
She said, “Now in my upkar  I’ve got it.”

00:49:36.506 --> 00:49:40.461
So I said, “You enjoy it now!”

00:49:40.701 --> 00:49:43.822
You have paid for it by doing upkar!

00:49:43.822 --> 00:49:54.816
Upkar is ... Upkar means in Hindi
.. doing it with our doing it

00:49:54.876 --> 00:50:01.156
You just do it, without doing it. You even do not know you are doing. It's so simple. Alright?

00:50:01.156 --> 00:50:03.096
It becomes part of your inner religion.

00:50:03.096 --> 00:50:10.180
Yes, otherwise, you think you are doing something, that means pride comes into you, and the whole thing is spoiled.

00:50:10.234 --> 00:50:16.177
But Mother, the more we surrender and the more
we have faith, the more it will be alright.

00:50:16.207 --> 00:50:22.328
Yes, it will be alright.You see, if you are alright, if
you are strong people, then the Virata becomes alright,

00:50:22.328 --> 00:50:29.019
the Primordial becomes alright, if you become a strong body.

00:50:29.692 --> 00:50:32.869
If some part of the body is sick you can cure it.

00:50:33.932 --> 00:50:41.011
How many cells do you need to fight them? Not much.

00:50:46.261 --> 00:50:49.071
But we are the fighting
cells. We have to fight them.

00:50:49.071 --> 00:50:52.181
By not becoming identified with them.

00:50:52.201 --> 00:50:57.221
You see, you have to fight with them in
such a way that you do not weep for them.

00:50:57.257 --> 00:51:00.137
Means you are affected by them. No!

00:51:00.177 --> 00:51:02.677
You are detached.

00:51:02.677 --> 00:51:05.457
You just say, “You will be
alright,” and they will be alright.

00:51:05.457 --> 00:51:09.007
So much powers you
have! Do you know that?

00:51:09.047 --> 00:51:14.211
But once you start weeping for
them, the power is neutralised.

00:51:17.047 --> 00:51:21.037
It should be done without any guide, anything,
you just say, “Alright, you will be alright.”

00:51:21.037 --> 00:51:26.567
Which is all well and good. Otherwise
there is no question of prestige for us!

00:51:27.821 --> 00:51:41.636
If somebody is cured, well and good. We have
not taken everybody’s bond that we should do it.

00:51:43.212 --> 00:51:49.246
We’ll do if we want to. If we don’t want to we’ll
not do it. It’s in complete freedom that we do it.

00:51:49.246 --> 00:51:55.606
At least I do! It’s in absolute freedom,

00:51:55.635 --> 00:51:59.336
because if I want to do, I will
do; otherwise I will not do.

00:51:59.815 --> 00:52:02.315
In the same way you should be.

00:52:03.775 --> 00:52:12.956
So then the detachment comes you see. Complete freedom
is also complete detachment, and that is complete love.

00:52:13.016 --> 00:52:23.677
Sometimes Mother when I go to some place people say that they used to know me before feeling very much for them and showing it,

00:52:23.691 --> 00:52:30.651
and that, if through Sahaja Yoga you become
unfeeling…That’s how they interpret it, becoming unfeeling.

00:52:30.648 --> 00:52:37.093
Unfeeling? No you should say, “Now
I understand that what was lacking.

00:52:37.163 --> 00:52:40.363
And I have too much feeling for
you. You become Sahaja Yogis.”

00:52:40.363 --> 00:52:45.113
You see, they always depended on
you and you had to give them.

00:52:45.151 --> 00:52:49.063
Alright, now you should say,
“You also become givers now!

00:52:49.113 --> 00:52:52.056
Through Sahaja Yoga you
can become equal to me.

00:52:52.103 --> 00:52:54.376
I want you to become that.”

00:52:54.376 --> 00:53:01.868
You see, sitting down and weeping for somebody
is no good. And some people are like this also.

00:53:01.998 --> 00:53:03.859
They like the sympathy?

00:53:03.859 --> 00:53:06.858
You see, they like the show of the thing.

00:53:09.539 --> 00:53:14.521
Say you go to a place and they say,
“Oh, have you seen? Is he with her?”

00:53:14.541 --> 00:53:17.452
All that should go away.

00:53:17.489 --> 00:53:24.192
Maria, for a person like me, I will just,
I may not even bother. Why should I?

00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:32.160
I’m not attached. But then, you see, people like it if
somebody comes and too much asks. That's not feeling!

00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:35.680
Feeling is when it is in pure detachment.

00:53:39.825 --> 00:53:45.849
You are not feelingless, you are not
emotionless, but you are emotion.

00:53:45.917 --> 00:53:49.505
You become the emotion.

00:53:53.748 --> 00:53:57.057
Emotion is identified with you completely.

00:53:57.122 --> 00:53:57.987
Do you understand?

00:53:58.027 --> 00:53:58.657
Yes

00:53:58.657 --> 00:54:01.157
You are the emotion.

00:54:01.227 --> 00:54:03.727
The complete ocean: ocean of emotion.

00:54:03.727 --> 00:54:05.577
You generate emotion!

00:54:05.577 --> 00:54:09.329
When you are with people they get into emotions.

00:54:09.419 --> 00:54:13.349
You can inspire emotions into them.

00:54:13.379 --> 00:54:18.736
But nobody’s emotion should affect
you, then only it is possible.

00:54:21.837 --> 00:54:25.616
Even the ocean cannot become like a pond.

00:54:25.666 --> 00:54:32.995
Do you remember Mother, in the letter, I wrote a
sentence that I have a little bit of a problem of work.

00:54:33.025 --> 00:54:35.225
This was the problem Mother.

00:54:35.225 --> 00:54:41.525
Although I put the people's names in a
bandhan and I would pray for them at home,

00:54:41.592 --> 00:54:46.865
at work I would be detached from their emotions and their problems

00:54:46.937 --> 00:54:56.075
and because of that they would be upset
why they could not attract my attention.

00:54:56.165 --> 00:55:01.526
You see, my attention was attracted but
not to the point to become part of it

00:55:01.553 --> 00:55:08.832
and that would upset them and that’s why I had the
problem because they sent very negative vibrations back

00:55:08.832 --> 00:55:14.391
which eventually I could not tolerate and feel..

00:55:14.422 --> 00:55:16.511
No, you should be tactful about it.

00:55:16.521 --> 00:55:20.011
You should be tactful. You should be tactful about them.

00:55:20.011 --> 00:55:27.011
That is not the thing. Only thing is, you see, even if you
bleed, it doesn’t matter as long as it doesn’t hurt you inside.

00:55:27.051 --> 00:55:29.551
If it’s all outside, it’s alright.

00:55:30.557 --> 00:55:36.477
Attention, when you give to somebody,
you should be fully attentive to yourself.

00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:43.911
But the attention Mother, that they needed
was a selfish one which I did not entertain.

00:55:44.011 --> 00:55:46.511
Don’t entertain them. You see,
what I am saying is that,

00:55:46.511 --> 00:55:53.601
as you are Realised you will be surprised that you are in
a different wavelength absolutely, on a different position.

00:55:53.631 --> 00:55:59.531
And it is going to be a little difficult to adjust
with others because they want you the same person.

00:55:59.582 --> 00:56:01.831
You cannot be the same. You are a different one.

00:56:01.857 --> 00:56:06.817
It was only that you could give them
something for the time being, that’s all.

00:56:07.075 --> 00:56:11.589
But now, they will know that you have curative
powers; you can cure them, you can do things.

00:56:11.635 --> 00:56:16.439
Your value will go up much more!

00:56:16.457 --> 00:56:20.359
So you need not try to worry about these things. Gradually they will accept you.

00:56:20.409 --> 00:56:22.909
Things have sorted themselves out.

00:56:22.909 --> 00:56:31.296
Yes, they will sort it out! There are thousands of people behind you! You don’t know there are chiranjeevas (eternal beings) there are great personalities behind you.

00:56:31.366 --> 00:56:33.866
So you just let go.

00:56:33.866 --> 00:56:41.966
And we are not to be guided by their norms, not by them. We have to put our own norms because we are different people.

00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:48.050
But first have confidence in yourselves! First thing!

00:56:57.547 --> 00:57:00.047
Are you better Atul now?

00:57:01.009 --> 00:57:04.389
Now, Simon how are you? Are you
feeling guilty about something?

00:57:04.849 --> 00:57:06.322
No.

00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:12.929
Now you don’t swing from one end to
another, just try to keep in the centre.

00:57:18.256 --> 00:57:24.660
You have read a lot and you know a lot,

00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:27.587
that’s called as dhyana. You have got dhyana.

00:57:27.685 --> 00:57:30.665
But you haven’t got bodha.

00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:32.585
Bodha.

00:57:32.585 --> 00:57:33.315
Oh Bodhi?

00:57:33.315 --> 00:57:35.145
Bodha

00:57:35.135 --> 00:57:40.435
Means your dhyana is not
enlightened as yet. Aright?

00:57:40.475 --> 00:57:47.736
Because one is ‘to know’, and the another is
‘to know that the knowledge is enlightened’.

00:57:47.783 --> 00:57:51.981
This is the difference
between the two. Alright?

00:57:51.981 --> 00:57:58.534
The other day Gavin asked me, “What is samadhi?”
So I told him, "It is enlightened awareness."

00:57:58.573 --> 00:58:04.484
Enlightened awareness. You are aware, but
you are not enlightened. Samadhi is that.

00:58:04.484 --> 00:58:13.093
So in Sahaja Yoga, first you get nirvichara samadhi
– that is thoughtless enlightened awareness.

00:58:13.143 --> 00:58:23.972
And secondly you get nirvikalpa samadhi –
that is doubtless enlightened awareness.

00:58:24.172 --> 00:58:30.046
So to go to doubtless condition
you must know to avoid doubts.

00:58:30.086 --> 00:58:33.722
You have to change your style of approach.

00:58:33.752 --> 00:58:39.332
You see, other things you might
have achieved through doubting,

00:58:39.352 --> 00:58:43.422
but Sahaja Yoga is achieved through resolve.

00:58:47.012 --> 00:58:49.575
You even have to pretend that
you don’t doubt to start with.

00:58:49.575 --> 00:58:56.172
You have to go on pretending with yourself. Tell your mind, “I
am not going to doubt.” Go on for a while. Then it works out.

00:58:56.172 --> 00:58:59.034
There’s nothing like the faith.

00:58:59.062 --> 00:59:02.997
Faith, I am saying, not
the blind faith but faith.

00:59:03.142 --> 00:59:09.487
You have got the vibrations
now. Now believe into them!

00:59:11.052 --> 00:59:13.313
That’s the only way!

00:59:15.783 --> 00:59:23.758
There’s no other way out I can tell you this much.
Those who have taken to doubting will never approach it.

00:59:25.577 --> 00:59:29.241
You’ll be thrown away all the time with doubts.

00:59:30.087 --> 00:59:34.991
And a time may come when my attention may
recede and you’ll drop out just like that.

00:59:35.151 --> 00:59:41.781
You just cannot do Sahaja Yoga like
that. But blind faith is not needed.

00:59:41.796 --> 00:59:43.886
First you feel the vibrations.

00:59:43.909 --> 00:59:46.251
You see for yourself.

00:59:46.321 --> 00:59:51.761
Either we absolutely have blind faith or we have
rationality. Can’t we be something in between?

00:59:55.196 --> 01:00:00.158
The people who are absolutely blind are useless.

01:00:00.348 --> 01:00:06.248
They might be saved because if they can ask questions to me that, “Are you this? Are you that?” Then they can be saved.

01:00:06.248 --> 01:00:09.218
If they come to that point!

01:00:09.264 --> 01:00:13.448
But those who are rational, they can never come into it!

01:00:15.124 --> 01:00:22.830
Because it’s like jumping like a monkey, from one
branch to another branch. You can never land down.

01:00:24.323 --> 01:00:33.395
It’s only through faith, shraddha, through
surrendering, you are going to achieve that state.

01:00:39.558 --> 01:00:45.478
And then small ripples here and there,
nothing, is going to disturb you.

01:00:47.277 --> 01:01:02.568
You are going to enjoy that state within
yourself. Allow your faith to dissolve you.

01:01:02.607 --> 01:01:06.496
You know the time is very short.

01:01:06.716 --> 01:01:16.070
You’ve got your Realisation and you take so
much time after that to come up to that,

01:01:16.087 --> 01:01:20.100
and that time is very much lost. Why do it?

01:01:20.133 --> 01:01:28.402
Now you have seen people who have shraddha how
far they have gone, so why not follow them?

01:01:39.826 --> 01:01:42.326
So that is very important

01:01:42.326 --> 01:01:46.985
that, by doubting you are not
going to achieve anything!

01:01:49.984 --> 01:01:54.165
You’ll be tossing. But you are to really put…

01:01:54.269 --> 01:01:58.934
Big girls have gone out.

01:01:59.019 --> 01:02:03.474
The big girls have gone out to play, you
also go out and play with them, alright?

01:02:03.504 --> 01:02:04.364
OK.

01:02:04.374 --> 01:02:09.764
Alright. See, how confident!
Because they are innocent.

01:02:10.728 --> 01:02:13.708
They have faith in themselves.

01:02:16.770 --> 01:02:23.714
So stop your rationality. It is not going to take you anywhere!

01:02:29.812 --> 01:02:37.896
You have to learn to develop your shraddha. Even you get Realisation, you cure people, you do anything.

01:02:37.896 --> 01:02:40.396
We have an example of somebody you know of.

01:02:40.396 --> 01:02:48.155
His mother was cured just like that. He was cured just like
that. He got a job just like that. He got whatever he wanted,

01:02:48.205 --> 01:02:50.705
and then suddenly he drops out!

01:02:50.705 --> 01:02:53.205
Without any shraddha.

01:02:59.626 --> 01:03:02.126
So that is what it is.

01:03:06.226 --> 01:03:15.757
So many have done like that because if you do not have shraddha, you get tired of jumping from one to another.

01:03:16.787 --> 01:03:19.969
All the time you are doubting in
this. It’s just a mental feat.

01:03:20.074 --> 01:03:27.291
We like to do circus for a while, it’s alright, but forget it! Now jump into it and get it!

01:03:27.398 --> 01:03:29.898
Now what do you lose?

01:03:31.647 --> 01:03:34.147
You lose nothing!

01:03:34.997 --> 01:03:37.237
We lose ego.

01:03:37.263 --> 01:03:41.127
Ego. You lose your ego but you get your personality.

01:03:41.127 --> 01:03:45.709
What do you lose? Nothing.
You get all the powers.

01:03:46.679 --> 01:03:50.539
Now the time is too short and you
are taking too long to do it.

01:03:52.006 --> 01:03:58.849
And some of you will be tired, jumping like that all the time
with your doubts, this way, that way. And what are you doubting?

01:04:02.276 --> 01:04:04.776
It’s all free.

01:04:04.776 --> 01:04:09.114
You don’t have to do anything about it.

01:04:09.154 --> 01:04:12.026
And doubting people can be quite foolish.

01:04:12.244 --> 01:04:16.334
They doubt about every nonsensical
thing which has no meaning at all.

01:04:17.576 --> 01:04:21.254
They see things which do not exist

01:04:21.276 --> 01:04:30.336
because it’s just, you see, a habit, or you can say an indulgence; you can say an entertainment for people, to doubt into this. And then doubt.

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:34.357
You see they are just jumping like monkeys.

01:04:34.417 --> 01:04:36.917
Stop that!

01:04:42.842 --> 01:04:52.309
Any one of you who goes down into shraddha and dissolves becomes a great instrument in the hands of God!

01:04:59.338 --> 01:05:01.838
Even to say that, “I doubt,” is wrong.

01:05:03.807 --> 01:05:09.117
These people think we are very honest
by saying, “I doubt. I doubt Mother.”

01:05:09.137 --> 01:05:12.267
Please give up such ‘honesties’!

01:05:12.307 --> 01:05:15.347
It’s absurd!

01:05:15.374 --> 01:05:21.095
This is ego which is making you
say these things that, “I doubt.”

01:05:21.165 --> 01:05:28.395
Because by saying that, it exists and you feel you are very honest. It’s not you are doubting, your ego is doubting.

01:05:32.609 --> 01:05:37.950
When you realise that, that your ego
is doubting, it will become easier.

01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:44.520
“It’s not I who is doubting,
it’s my ego which is doubting.

01:05:44.567 --> 01:05:47.710
Or maybe some possession
in me which is doubting.”

01:05:50.809 --> 01:05:56.562
“Am I playing into the hands of
some possession or my own ego?”

01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:01.966
That’s what it is – hundred percent!

01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:07.862
Because those who have not doubted have gone
too far. You have seen people in India.

01:06:08.926 --> 01:06:11.749
You have seen Dhumal.

01:06:11.749 --> 01:06:14.036
He never doubted!

01:06:14.036 --> 01:06:19.058
His own brother, he was helped so much: he had no money to eat his food,

01:06:19.248 --> 01:06:23.568
 he had gone to that condition because he had put a lot of money in a business which was failing.

01:06:23.718 --> 01:06:27.386
When he came to Sahaja Yoga his business
started earning just like that.

01:06:27.439 --> 01:06:29.412
He became a moneyed man.

01:06:29.382 --> 01:06:32.462
His child was sick, he was cured. He was sick, he was cured.

01:06:32.602 --> 01:06:36.302
 His wife was sick with something incurable, she was cured.

01:06:36.314 --> 01:06:38.814
But still he was doubting.

01:06:40.218 --> 01:06:42.178
He started taking drinks after that.

01:06:42.201 --> 01:06:45.538
He never used to take drinks, after
doubting he started taking drinks.

01:06:45.538 --> 01:06:50.598
He did all that was prohibited in Sahaja Yoga just to prove his point.

01:06:50.658 --> 01:06:53.158
And where is he now?

01:06:57.573 --> 01:07:03.578
I would say, pay attention to
your Self and not to your doubts!

01:07:03.578 --> 01:07:09.319
The doubts are coming from some dark
corners of your mind which is with you.

01:07:09.378 --> 01:07:14.248
What are you going to lose is
the point you must look into.

01:07:14.288 --> 01:07:18.362
Sort it out there. What have others lost?

01:07:19.472 --> 01:07:21.972
They have gained.

01:07:23.202 --> 01:07:30.058
Those who have doubted have lost, lost time.

01:07:37.209 --> 01:07:41.859
So don’t waste your time in useless things.

01:07:44.364 --> 01:07:46.864
There’s nothing to doubt.

01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:55.892
Every word I say is
the truth and the truth.

01:07:59.982 --> 01:08:02.482
See the vibrations.

01:08:06.655 --> 01:08:10.352
You see! I have to boast.

01:08:10.352 --> 01:08:15.442
You see! Every word.

01:08:18.362 --> 01:08:20.862
So don’t doubt it!

01:08:20.862 --> 01:08:25.142
Just take it and take it and take it.

01:08:25.182 --> 01:08:28.680
I know all this myself.

01:08:28.702 --> 01:08:33.487
I am not going to achieve anything by telling you these things,

01:08:35.123 --> 01:08:43.520
except that you will know me and I will know you.

01:08:49.866 --> 01:08:55.176
You are not to lose anything. You have to gain.

01:08:55.211 --> 01:09:01.339
So tell your mind to shut up for a while! It
is already running with a very fast speed.

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:24.940
We want to get to that state of complete
doubtless awareness and, for that,

01:09:24.964 --> 01:09:30.824
are we going to carry these
doubts in our pockets?

01:09:31.704 --> 01:09:39.834
They have no meaning. They will all be neutralised. You have seen people who have neutralised it. But those who do it…

01:09:44.323 --> 01:09:46.823
I have no word.

01:09:55.738 --> 01:09:58.238
Steady your shraddha. Steady it!

01:09:58.238 --> 01:10:03.088
It’s a force. It’s like a flame of a candle.

01:10:03.088 --> 01:10:05.588
Steady it!

01:10:05.912 --> 01:10:17.623
But by your doubts you are putting heavy pressure
on it and the flame, it has to face those doubts.

01:10:18.513 --> 01:10:21.013
You are weakening yourself!

01:10:37.675 --> 01:10:41.927
Simon you have to get well. You are a seeker for ages now.

01:10:41.924 --> 01:10:47.336
In many lives you have been seeking. And now you
are not going to play about anymore. Alright?

01:10:47.434 --> 01:10:52.656
You are going to be a certain
(unclear) . Absolutely, alright?

01:10:53.498 --> 01:10:55.998
Mataji may I go now?

01:10:56.878 --> 01:10:58.010
Alright. You may go.

01:10:58.050 --> 01:11:00.910
See you

01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:04.570
And you throw those away and bring
seven more [lemons] to me in my house.

01:11:04.570 --> 01:11:05.670
Tomorrow night?

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:07.130
Tomorrow night.

01:11:07.170 --> 01:11:09.670
What time would you like me to turn up?

01:11:09.670 --> 01:11:13.620
Oh, any time from about five
onwards, that’s better. Alright?

01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:18.130
Five, six, anytime. Come to my house, bring them. 

01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:22.540
And ask Philippa to come and see me also tomorrow evening, if possible,

01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:26.157
because I’ll talk to her about
this, what is to be given.

01:11:26.190 --> 01:11:28.840
Seven chillies as well as seven lemons?

01:11:28.869 --> 01:11:34.457
Yes, yes. Alright? And as I love you, try to
love yourself. And now don’t get after yourself.

01:13:01.726 --> 01:13:08.826
One more thing I would like to tell you, because
there's time today, I can tell you about these things.

01:13:08.876 --> 01:13:14.386
for certain chakras how to clear
them, even physically you can try.

01:13:14.425 --> 01:13:17.754
One of them is of Vishuddhi chakra.

01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:24.437
Now for Vishuddhi chakra, I have told you many things but you can try one more thing which will help you.

01:13:24.453 --> 01:13:28.557
Is to put your head on the ground like this,

01:13:28.604 --> 01:13:33.117
near a bed, with your feet on the bed, resting on the bed.

01:13:33.161 --> 01:13:39.128
And try to come on the bed more and more,

01:13:40.361 --> 01:13:41.997
more and more.

01:13:42.028 --> 01:13:47.715
The body... push it on the bed so the whole pressure comes up here.

01:13:47.845 --> 01:13:51.354
Alright. And then keep my photograph handy.

01:13:51.387 --> 01:13:58.933
In that stage you see my photograph.
It will improve your Vishuddhis.

01:13:58.953 --> 01:14:02.442
In that case, in case you have Left Vishuddhi,

01:14:02.482 --> 01:14:08.002
then you turn your face towards the right and see it.

01:14:08.085 --> 01:14:13.638
If you have the Right Vishuddhi then turn
your face to the left and see my photograph.

01:14:13.908 --> 01:14:19.741
That will help you because all of you have
Vishuddhi problem. This will be of help.

01:14:19.763 --> 01:14:22.811
You mean the neck on the floor?

01:14:22.810 --> 01:14:25.310
On the floor if you lie down.

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:34.830
Now just lie down now, facing that side
towards the…yes, now go ahead, like that.

01:14:34.849 --> 01:14:40.433
Gavin be careful. Now, go down. You go down, and more, more.

01:14:40.463 --> 01:14:44.373
Again try to bring this lower portion on top.

01:14:44.408 --> 01:14:47.891
Bring the body straight.

01:14:49.228 --> 01:14:52.888
Yes. So that there isn’t much of a Hatha Yoga.

01:14:52.953 --> 01:14:55.453
Can you see? Yes.

01:14:56.940 --> 01:15:04.592
Do you rest the weight on your shoulders
or the head? Pressure on the neck?

01:15:04.693 --> 01:15:09.748
More on the Vishuddhi. Better now?

01:15:11.284 --> 01:15:16.934
Where do you have the photo if you’re not going to look at it?

01:15:22.844 --> 01:15:25.840
No, no. You have the photo whichever side you look.

01:15:25.884 --> 01:15:29.062
Yeah, I know. But if you’re not going
to look to the left or the right?

01:15:29.092 --> 01:15:34.765
You turn your photograph with you. You must look at the
photograph isn’t it? Because it helps your Agnya, always.

01:15:34.805 --> 01:15:39.995
You see, if your Agnya is kept clear then
it should be cleared out better, that's why.

01:15:40.063 --> 01:15:42.563
You see that's why you have to have a photograph,

01:15:42.563 --> 01:15:48.495
because your Agnya can be cleared out with that. Otherwise the Agnya is blocked. You see? Better?

01:15:48.512 --> 01:15:50.041
Hmmm. It’s very good.

01:15:50.035 --> 01:15:52.535
Very good!

01:15:53.205 --> 01:15:55.525
All of you should try this thing.

01:15:55.525 --> 01:16:00.133
I have told you about, for Swadishthana,
what should be done. That you remember?

01:16:00.166 --> 01:16:01.323
Should I show them?

01:16:01.323 --> 01:16:05.483
Yes show them what is to be done
for Swadishthana – physically.

01:16:10.977 --> 01:16:13.477
And you say the mantra?

01:16:14.357 --> 01:16:18.995
Yes you can say the mantra,
would be a good idea.

01:16:19.085 --> 01:16:22.546
Now for people who have a problem of Mooladhara,

01:16:22.575 --> 01:16:32.662
or say those who cannot sit on the ground and sort of thing:
for them, it’s to practice with both your legs like this.

01:16:32.692 --> 01:16:37.562
Put them like that, you too have the same problem.

01:16:37.562 --> 01:16:45.942
Put these two [feet] together like this. You see, you cannot stretch it much. Try to stretch it down (the knees) on to the ground!

01:16:45.972 --> 01:16:52.081
Try to, try to, as much as you can!
But, in one shot you cannot do it!

01:16:53.366 --> 01:16:54.698
You have to put your knees down?

01:16:54.750 --> 01:16:59.666
Yes. Put your knees down.
They must touch the ground.

01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:03.200
I can do perfectly, despite my fat!

01:17:07.614 --> 01:17:14.069
Try to raise it and push that down. Gradually you have to do it. You’ll do it the bathroom, you will work it out.

01:17:14.209 --> 01:17:18.659
That’s very good. You lift this so
only your Mooladhara is touching.

01:17:26.173 --> 01:17:33.573
Try to put it further, further. Now try to do that -
further. That helps you see, that helps. Further up! No.

01:17:33.573 --> 01:17:41.733
No, no, put this together and move that! Just push that,
just feet. No, no feet! Spread the feet .

01:17:41.773 --> 01:17:43.033
Feet apart.

01:17:43.061 --> 01:17:45.561
Now do as I tell you.

01:17:46.789 --> 01:17:48.179
Where do you live?

01:17:48.179 --> 01:17:50.679
Wiltshire.

01:17:50.679 --> 01:17:53.988
Spread much more. Spread it much more

01:17:56.095 --> 01:17:58.595
That helps you see. That helps.

01:18:00.649 --> 01:18:03.149
First you do this exercise.

01:18:14.679 --> 01:18:18.461
It’s working out. It’s much better now.

01:18:26.011 --> 01:18:29.921
Gradually, you will see it will work
out, gradually. It's better now.

01:18:29.936 --> 01:18:32.726
You see gradually it will work out, gradually, if you do it.

01:18:32.726 --> 01:18:37.953
It’s good for Mooladhara. For all the people who
have mooladhara problem, this would be a good idea.

01:18:38.033 --> 01:18:41.083
So gradually we should see to different chakras.

01:18:43.806 --> 01:18:45.346
Now for the Hamsa.

01:18:45.365 --> 01:18:46.296
Which Chakra?

01:18:46.326 --> 01:18:48.654
Hamsa!

01:18:48.694 --> 01:18:55.054
You lie on your body like that on your stomach.

01:18:58.895 --> 01:19:00.214
Now come along!

01:19:00.214 --> 01:19:06.374
Put your these things, Mooladharas, here on the Hamsa,

01:19:06.394 --> 01:19:10.181
and now ask the Mother Earth to suck in your problems.

01:19:12.758 --> 01:19:15.924
But the pressure should be quite a lot on that.

01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:31.330
Now you move it.

01:19:42.534 --> 01:19:48.804
Better? You feel better? You can feel the
sensation at the bottom. Allow them to disappear.

01:19:52.491 --> 01:19:57.660
Here, even your pressure will go away from your…

01:19:57.700 --> 01:20:00.200
You’ll feel relieved from the pressure.
