00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.489
I again see today some new faces

00:00:05.489 --> 00:00:08.849
who have come here,

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:15.175
and I have to explain again today,

00:00:15.175 --> 00:00:20.205
for the first time to them,

00:00:20.215 --> 00:00:25.752
what is Sahaja Yoga,

00:00:25.755 --> 00:00:30.733
which has been promised in various scriptures

00:00:30.745 --> 00:00:37.005
that you have to get your Second Birth.

00:00:37.026 --> 00:00:39.526
You have to be born again.

00:00:39.515 --> 00:00:43.328
It is said. Christ has said too,

00:00:43.318 --> 00:00:45.818
the same thing.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.860
But people have not been able to ponder

00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:58.930
on this subject: what does that mean – our Second Birth?

00:00:58.912 --> 00:01:03.172
Are we not already born as human beings?

00:01:03.172 --> 00:01:06.452
We are born

00:01:06.462 --> 00:01:08.914
but the human beings, which are born,

00:01:08.913 --> 00:01:12.092
are told that you are to be 'born again.'

00:01:12.082 --> 00:01:14.874
Now what are we going to do?

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:19.884
So they asked, "Are we to enter
into our mother's womb again?

00:01:19.865 --> 00:01:23.564
And are to be born again?"

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:30.630
He said, :You'll be born of the
Holy Ghost, of the Holy Spirit."

00:01:30.644 --> 00:01:36.640
The Holy Ghost that He talked
about is the Kundalini within us.

00:01:36.651 --> 00:01:39.151
She is the part of the Holy Ghost,

00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:42.573
or you can say the reflection of the Holy Ghost,

00:01:42.593 --> 00:01:48.773
which exists as all-pervading power.

00:01:48.797 --> 00:01:54.227
Actually the all-pervading power of Divine Love

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:00.244
is the love of Holy Ghost or Her aura.

00:02:00.238 --> 00:02:06.774
This is reflected within us, as the power of desire

00:02:08.598 --> 00:02:17.995
as shown in the picture in
the triangular bone of sacrum

00:02:17.986 --> 00:02:21.305
and coils itself in three and a half rounds.

00:02:27.186 --> 00:02:32.826
If you could ask the child to play there,
it would be better. Whose child is this?

00:02:36.838 --> 00:02:41.165
Children don't understand all, they
need not understand. They are all right.

00:02:41.165 --> 00:02:45.085
They're realised. They're enjoying themselves.

00:02:53.376 --> 00:02:58.817
This force, which is called as residual force,

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.597
is the desire of God,

00:03:02.575 --> 00:03:13.035
which resides within us in a dormant way.

00:03:13.036 --> 00:03:17.368
We actually do not know what is the desire of God.

00:03:17.385 --> 00:03:18.896
We have our own conclusions,

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:20.256
our own conceptions,

00:03:20.257 --> 00:03:23.438
our own ideas that I am doing the work of God.

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.219
But you are not yet connected with God,

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:28.219
how can you do the work of God?

00:03:28.204 --> 00:03:30.704
There is no way of really establishing

00:03:30.704 --> 00:03:33.204
any actual rapport with God,

00:03:33.204 --> 00:03:36.159
and how can you say that you are related to God

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.659
or you are doing the work of God?

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:42.317
It’s all right that God is looking after you,

00:03:42.317 --> 00:03:44.227
He is managing you,

00:03:44.227 --> 00:03:46.889
He has given you this life, is correct.

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:51.841
But there is no way of finding God

00:03:51.847 --> 00:03:53.911
in your conscious mind.

00:03:53.897 --> 00:03:56.397
It's just your mental activity

00:03:56.397 --> 00:03:58.897
maybe your ego,

00:03:58.897 --> 00:04:02.363
which says, "I am God."

00:04:02.357 --> 00:04:06.685
Some people say, "I like it!"

00:04:06.687 --> 00:04:09.187
But why do you like it?

00:04:09.187 --> 00:04:11.295
Because I think, I like it.

00:04:11.327 --> 00:04:15.165
Then, why, whatever you think is your own.

00:04:15.165 --> 00:04:16.835
It is not God’s,

00:04:16.845 --> 00:04:26.565
how do you say, with such cock-sure attitude

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:30.805
that you are connected with God?

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.001
Then they will start discussing about it.

00:04:32.983 --> 00:04:35.483
They sit down and talk about it

00:04:35.483 --> 00:04:39.183
Yesterday only we had a very funny visitor in Paris

00:04:39.183 --> 00:04:43.383
and he started it like a tape record

00:04:43.393 --> 00:04:47.193
and he just started telling Me what he thinks.

00:04:47.205 --> 00:04:50.653
But your thinking is your own imagination.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.140
There is no actual experience in it.

00:04:53.154 --> 00:04:56.606
There is no actuality.

00:04:56.616 --> 00:05:00.546
I said, "This is fanaticism."

00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:03.033
When you start thinking about something

00:05:03.033 --> 00:05:07.624
and accept it as real, then it is fanaticism,

00:05:07.628 --> 00:05:08.634
of any kind.

00:05:08.628 --> 00:05:13.446
You can be a football fanatic.

00:05:13.456 --> 00:05:16.206
You think that a particular person must win.

00:05:16.206 --> 00:05:18.706
It becomes sort of your thinking.

00:05:18.706 --> 00:05:21.206
Then that person must win, if he does not win

00:05:21.206 --> 00:05:24.656
then you are going to kill everybody else.

00:05:24.656 --> 00:05:26.776
If you go a little further with it,

00:05:26.776 --> 00:05:35.678
you think that you are a great benevolent person.

00:05:35.675 --> 00:05:37.488
Then whatever you think,

00:05:37.505 --> 00:05:38.848
you feel that this is the thing

00:05:38.798 --> 00:05:41.838
that is going to bring benevolence to people.

00:05:41.848 --> 00:05:43.928
but what is the proof?

00:05:43.928 --> 00:05:50.642
That what you think is the thing wanted by God.

00:05:50.658 --> 00:05:51.868
All your thinking

00:05:51.868 --> 00:05:58.528
is based either on your conditioning,

00:05:58.518 --> 00:05:59.648
whatever you have read,

00:05:59.658 --> 00:06:01.499
if you are born a Christian all your thinking

00:06:01.488 --> 00:06:03.249
will be Christian thinking means church's

00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:05.738
thinking not God's thinking.

00:06:05.743 --> 00:06:09.219
If you are a Hindu, you will think like a Hindu

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:11.719
of a temple or some sort of a Guru

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:14.219
or somebody who has taught you something.

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:18.940
If you are a Muslim you might become Khomeini

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:21.479
anything is possible!

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:23.029
Are we going in the same direction

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:24.910
with our thinking?

00:06:24.893 --> 00:06:28.900
Or are we related to God?

00:06:28.903 --> 00:06:31.890
First, relationship with God must be established.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.390
That is extremely important

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.890
before we talk of God

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.653
because all our thinking is our conditioning

00:06:40.653 --> 00:06:44.572
or else our imagination.

00:06:44.563 --> 00:06:45.902
There are some people who met Me

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:48.022
they said they have met God.

00:06:48.022 --> 00:06:50.522
I said, "Really?  How, how does he look like?"

00:06:50.522 --> 00:06:52.582
"Oh, I met him on the street."

00:06:52.602 --> 00:06:53.632
I said, "Very good."

00:06:53.632 --> 00:06:56.132
And somebody says, "I am Christ."

00:06:56.132 --> 00:06:58.632
Somebody says, "I am Krishna."

00:06:58.632 --> 00:07:02.877
But what is the proof?

00:07:02.872 --> 00:07:05.372
I mean, supposing I say this is gold.

00:07:05.372 --> 00:07:07.627
Then gold has a density.

00:07:07.632 --> 00:07:09.877
You can find out whether it is gold or silver

00:07:09.858 --> 00:07:12.127
or something but you cannot just go on saying,

00:07:12.127 --> 00:07:18.380
“I think it is gold." So it becomes gold, can it?

00:07:18.397 --> 00:07:20.560
In the same way our faith,

00:07:20.557 --> 00:07:24.680
because we think we have a belief in it,

00:07:24.697 --> 00:07:27.740
is mythical – as far as you are concerned,

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.965
as far as anybody else is concerned.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.480
Unless and until you give the proof of God,

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.655
nobody is going to believe in God any further,

00:07:34.655 --> 00:07:36.375
I can tell you this much.

00:07:36.375 --> 00:07:37.335
And this is the reason

00:07:37.302 --> 00:07:39.395
another mythical stuff is coming up

00:07:39.395 --> 00:07:40.875
is that there is no God.

00:07:40.851 --> 00:07:44.845
This is another myth.

00:07:44.851 --> 00:07:47.351
Either to believe that you are connected with God

00:07:47.351 --> 00:07:49.851
is equally mythical as to say there is no God.

00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:51.535
Because if you have not met Him

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.351
how do you say, there is not? There may be,

00:07:53.328 --> 00:07:57.081
may not be – is a better situation.

00:07:57.087 --> 00:07:59.587
Just to denounce Him that there is no God,

00:07:59.587 --> 00:08:02.087
is another myth.

00:08:02.087 --> 00:08:04.587
We some how or other managed to live with a myth.

00:08:04.587 --> 00:08:08.774
It’s very comfortable to live with myth.

00:08:08.777 --> 00:08:10.524
It’s a comfortable life; we do not want to

00:08:10.505 --> 00:08:12.264
give up our comforts.

00:08:12.264 --> 00:08:14.394
As just now, I was telling someone

00:08:14.394 --> 00:08:18.244
that a little shell contains a little oyster in it.

00:08:18.244 --> 00:08:21.226
Now, the oyster doesn’t want to get out of the shell.

00:08:21.226 --> 00:08:23.726
It’s quite comfortable.

00:08:23.726 --> 00:08:27.594
And a little bit of a sand comes in

00:08:27.599 --> 00:08:36.550
and it sat troubling the comfort of the oyster.

00:08:36.564 --> 00:08:41.380
So, oyster takes out his saliva

00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:44.150
goes round it, makes it softer,

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.080
puts it there, curls up a little bit of its body

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.896
and says, “Now I am comfortable now I'm

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:50.336
very satisfied, it’s all right.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.316
The shell is the thing for me."

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.820
And that’s how we go on living with the shell

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.696
avoiding understanding

00:08:57.706 --> 00:09:03.816
that this shell is not the thing we are seeking.

00:09:03.836 --> 00:09:08.026
So, one has to get out of that
comfortable feeling one has.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.540
If you have a house, very nice!

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.505
I’ve got children, very nice!

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.990
I’ve got a wife, I’ve got a car. It's all right.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:19.615
I am very comfortable, I am very satisfied.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:27.824
But then, certain calamities come in.

00:09:27.814 --> 00:09:31.044
You are faced with them.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.274
Problems come in

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:38.746
and then you think,

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:41.250
"I never waited for this.

00:09:41.266 --> 00:09:43.766
It was most unexpected."

00:09:46.046 --> 00:09:49.347
There are another set of people,

00:09:49.366 --> 00:09:54.397
who think – who ‘think’, again!

00:09:54.406 --> 00:10:02.366
that they have to search God.

00:10:02.386 --> 00:10:08.857
And that’s how they jump into sea.

00:10:08.866 --> 00:10:11.027
They jump into fire,

00:10:11.031 --> 00:10:11.997
they jump into water,

00:10:11.997 --> 00:10:13.897
they jump into all kinds of things

00:10:13.897 --> 00:10:19.088
without understanding what danger it entails.

00:10:19.108 --> 00:10:21.548
So one side we have a comfortably coiled up

00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:23.768
an oyster and another is an oyster

00:10:23.778 --> 00:10:25.588
which is burnt up

00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:33.555
which is either drowned or something.

00:10:33.568 --> 00:10:39.905
So what should a human being do?

00:10:39.915 --> 00:10:44.445
He should be comfortable,

00:10:44.445 --> 00:10:46.675
but all the time he should think that

00:10:46.674 --> 00:10:50.955
“I have not yet met God, I must meet.

00:10:50.955 --> 00:10:53.414
I have to watch and see,

00:10:53.424 --> 00:10:57.204
I have to understand."

00:10:57.204 --> 00:10:59.704
Oyster in the shell

00:10:59.704 --> 00:11:03.608
is better sometimes

00:11:03.608 --> 00:11:09.478
than the oyster, which is completely fried out.

00:11:09.478 --> 00:11:11.978
But the oyster in the shell

00:11:11.978 --> 00:11:14.478
will die its own death.

00:11:14.478 --> 00:11:17.433
But there is a possibility about the oyster

00:11:17.433 --> 00:11:19.933
which has come out that he might meet

00:11:19.933 --> 00:11:22.883
something.

00:11:22.872 --> 00:11:26.296
Because he is a seeker

00:11:26.296 --> 00:11:29.716
God also looks after him,

00:11:29.739 --> 00:11:33.786
God also wants to help.

00:11:33.806 --> 00:11:36.226
If he could listen to his own unconscious,

00:11:36.246 --> 00:11:39.296
he could work it out.

00:11:42.276 --> 00:11:46.221
Sahaja Yoga is not a new thing.

00:11:46.256 --> 00:11:48.461
Sahaja means ‘spontaneous’.

00:11:48.466 --> 00:11:50.966
Everything that happens in life is spontaneous.

00:11:51.536 --> 00:11:53.576
From amoeba to this stage, you have come

00:11:53.576 --> 00:11:58.206
spontaneously, 'Sahaja,' born with you.

00:11:58.206 --> 00:12:01.506
It is within you!

00:12:06.706 --> 00:12:10.812
Gradually, as a seed sprouts into a flower

00:12:10.812 --> 00:12:13.312
and then the fragrance starts emitting out

00:12:13.312 --> 00:12:14.488
from the flower,

00:12:14.488 --> 00:12:21.332
in the same way it is all built in you.

00:12:21.332 --> 00:12:26.636
You don’t have to go anywhere, it is between

00:12:26.635 --> 00:12:29.776
your own thinking

00:12:29.795 --> 00:12:36.366
and your desiring, it resides.

00:12:38.916 --> 00:12:42.256
You desire something

00:12:42.266 --> 00:12:45.656
and you don’t think about it

00:12:45.676 --> 00:12:48.732
that is the best way you can do.

00:12:48.732 --> 00:12:51.232
We have two capacities within us,

00:12:51.232 --> 00:12:55.779
one is to desire. With this left side,

00:12:55.793 --> 00:13:02.339
the deep blue coloured channel within us,

00:13:02.349 --> 00:13:04.499
the desire.

00:13:04.519 --> 00:13:06.459
It manifests outside

00:13:06.459 --> 00:13:17.033
as left sympathetic nervous system,

00:13:17.013 --> 00:13:21.773
which is our emotional side,

00:13:21.773 --> 00:13:26.933
which is responsible for collecting all our past,

00:13:26.932 --> 00:13:29.166
all our experiences, all our conditioning.

00:13:29.166 --> 00:13:31.143
This is the psyche about which

00:13:31.156 --> 00:13:35.622
the psychologists are worried.

00:13:35.623 --> 00:13:38.812
So, we desire.

00:13:38.802 --> 00:13:43.272
And the right side one, the yellow coloured line

00:13:43.292 --> 00:13:47.302
represents the power by which we maintain

00:13:47.295 --> 00:13:49.795
our physical being

00:13:49.795 --> 00:13:55.749
and ultimately we start thinking.

00:13:55.755 --> 00:13:59.699
Between these two resides

00:13:59.699 --> 00:14:02.209
the power of our evolution.

00:14:04.289 --> 00:14:06.235
So we have left side and right side

00:14:06.269 --> 00:14:08.065
sympathetic nervous system,

00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:10.569
manifested in the gross, and in the centre

00:14:10.569 --> 00:14:13.365
is the parasympathetic.

00:14:13.379 --> 00:14:15.415
Parasympathetic is a system

00:14:15.409 --> 00:14:17.909
which shows how much we have evolved so far.

00:14:17.909 --> 00:14:20.652
How much we have achieved so far up to

00:14:20.662 --> 00:14:23.532
human level.

00:14:23.555 --> 00:14:26.055
Only human beings think that

00:14:26.055 --> 00:14:32.571
they have to achieve God, not animals.

00:14:32.575 --> 00:14:34.590
They have reached that state that they think

00:14:34.561 --> 00:14:36.094
that they have to achieve God,

00:14:36.091 --> 00:14:39.734
they desire that they have to achieve God.

00:14:39.741 --> 00:14:45.796
There is a gap between their achievement

00:14:45.794 --> 00:14:48.736
and there is the desire.

00:14:48.751 --> 00:14:52.842
This is to be crossed.

00:14:52.842 --> 00:14:58.762
But their desire cannot work it out,

00:14:58.752 --> 00:15:03.082
only their desire can call for the help from God,

00:15:03.082 --> 00:15:05.582
and the God’s desire is within you

00:15:05.582 --> 00:15:10.202
in this triangular bone lying dormant.

00:15:10.212 --> 00:15:15.562
This God’s desire is called as Kundalini.

00:15:15.572 --> 00:15:18.072
That God’s desire has to rise within you,

00:15:18.072 --> 00:15:23.185
and it is He who has to give you the Second Birth

00:15:23.205 --> 00:15:25.195
or you can say that the She, the Mother,

00:15:25.205 --> 00:15:28.513
has to give you the Second Birth.

00:15:28.513 --> 00:15:30.627
This is the Holy Ghost

00:15:30.643 --> 00:15:33.143
about which Christ could not talk

00:15:33.143 --> 00:15:36.737
to those mad people who really crucified Him.

00:15:36.743 --> 00:15:41.417
They were mad that they thought that Christ

00:15:41.427 --> 00:15:46.809
was blasphemous.

00:15:46.809 --> 00:15:48.349
Just think of it!

00:15:48.349 --> 00:15:50.439
And today we have churches and people,

00:15:50.439 --> 00:15:52.939
and this and that.

00:15:56.029 --> 00:15:58.069
When He lived nobody accepted Him,

00:15:58.069 --> 00:16:02.259
nobody recognised Him

00:16:02.259 --> 00:16:04.209
When He came, they talked of Moses,

00:16:04.209 --> 00:16:08.599
Abraham.

00:16:08.599 --> 00:16:11.099
It is very nice to handle Christ,

00:16:11.069 --> 00:16:13.329
better talk about them, so that  we don't have

00:16:13.329 --> 00:16:15.829
to face reality.

00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:18.329
Because if they had recognised Christ

00:16:18.329 --> 00:16:20.001
then Christ would have said, "All right

00:16:19.948 --> 00:16:22.078
if you are recognising Me, then get your

00:16:22.078 --> 00:16:27.108
Realisation

00:16:27.121 --> 00:16:29.505
and understand yourself.”

00:16:29.491 --> 00:16:31.525
They where not prepared for this.

00:16:31.531 --> 00:16:33.755
Only twelve people somehow – you see

00:16:33.741 --> 00:16:36.241
managed to be there, somehow.

00:16:36.241 --> 00:16:42.691
They would not accept Him either.

00:16:42.681 --> 00:16:46.761
Till He was resurrected

00:16:46.751 --> 00:16:50.861
then they accepted Him, in a way.

00:16:50.881 --> 00:16:52.531
And then, what are you going to do

00:16:52.539 --> 00:16:56.191
but to create a myth around it.

00:16:56.199 --> 00:16:57.759
And to say that, “Of course,

00:16:57.759 --> 00:16:58.989
we believed in Christ.”

00:16:59.002 --> 00:17:02.205
Now what, which Christ did you believe in?

00:17:02.215 --> 00:17:05.435
Because that Christ, whom you had to face

00:17:05.435 --> 00:17:08.385
you did not face.

00:17:08.375 --> 00:17:12.125
And now you live in imaginary world,

00:17:12.135 --> 00:17:14.875
you have your own paradise about it.

00:17:14.871 --> 00:17:17.605
Where does He live within us?

00:17:17.601 --> 00:17:23.591
Has He created any position within us?

00:17:23.591 --> 00:17:26.391
Is there any meaning to His life,

00:17:26.398 --> 00:17:30.791
which has left a permanent mark within us

00:17:30.791 --> 00:17:33.291
Was He one of the
mile-stones within us?

00:17:33.291 --> 00:17:37.261
If so – where does He reside within us?

00:17:37.269 --> 00:17:39.219
How can we be connected to him?

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:42.569
Nobody made any exploration about it.

00:17:42.582 --> 00:17:45.945
Again the comfortable shell started.

00:17:45.942 --> 00:17:47.845
It has happened not once,

00:17:47.832 --> 00:17:50.015
thousands of years it has been happening,

00:17:50.022 --> 00:17:52.265
whenever an Incarnation came on this Earth

00:17:52.262 --> 00:17:56.845
that’s how they behaved.

00:17:56.852 --> 00:18:00.182
When Rama came they said,
“We believe in Parashurama”,

00:18:00.188 --> 00:18:01.652
when Krishna came they said,

00:18:01.638 --> 00:18:03.932
"We believe in Rama."

00:18:03.918 --> 00:18:08.552
Same thing with Christ, with everyone.

00:18:08.548 --> 00:18:11.048
But you better now recognise

00:18:11.048 --> 00:18:15.638
and know yourself, and face it once for all,

00:18:15.639 --> 00:18:17.658
the time has come.

00:18:17.658 --> 00:18:20.639
How long are you going to live with your myths?

00:18:20.639 --> 00:18:24.108
The time has come.

00:18:24.102 --> 00:18:31.608
It has nothing to do with
East, West or North and South.

00:18:31.623 --> 00:18:34.123
Most amazing is that in the West,

00:18:34.123 --> 00:18:38.484
people are afraid that this is Eastern knowledge.

00:18:38.503 --> 00:18:41.204
The other day only one lady who is a Realised Soul,

00:18:41.194 --> 00:18:43.044
her son is a Realised Soul.

00:18:43.044 --> 00:18:45.544
They said their teacher was very anxious

00:18:45.544 --> 00:18:47.964
about my son, because he said, "Why are you

00:18:47.964 --> 00:18:50.464
giving this Eastern knowledge to him?"

00:18:50.464 --> 00:18:53.814
How can it be Eastern? It is universal knowledge

00:18:53.814 --> 00:18:56.314
I said, "Why don't you go and ask the teacher

00:18:56.314 --> 00:19:01.179
was Christ born in England or in America?

00:19:03.459 --> 00:19:05.959
His cross is even, you can find it

00:19:05.959 --> 00:19:13.923
on the airport of London.

00:19:15.897 --> 00:19:18.647
Because I think that Christ was an Englishman.

00:19:18.855 --> 00:19:20.517
So it’s all right, he has to – poor thing

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:24.425
has to become an Englishman. What to do?

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:27.645
This knowledge cannot be limited to Indians

00:19:27.615 --> 00:19:30.115
or to English or to anyone.

00:19:30.115 --> 00:19:34.184
It is God’s knowledge, it is for everyone of you

00:19:34.175 --> 00:19:39.155
it is your right to know.

00:19:39.165 --> 00:19:43.465
All of you have got Kundalini.

00:19:43.465 --> 00:19:45.965
You can see with your naked eyes its pulsation;

00:19:45.976 --> 00:19:48.476
you can see its rising.

00:19:48.453 --> 00:19:50.953
You can see its piercing through,

00:19:50.953 --> 00:19:52.685
you can feel it, it throbbing here.

00:19:52.685 --> 00:19:56.050
You can see the piercing.

00:19:56.074 --> 00:19:57.660
You can see, when it pierces through,

00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:00.980
how you become actually collectively conscious.

00:20:00.982 --> 00:20:05.780
You do become.

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:10.842
It’s a fact! And how can you avoid fact?

00:20:10.833 --> 00:20:13.333
And why should you avoid?

00:20:13.333 --> 00:20:16.923
Because reality is so beautiful,

00:20:16.923 --> 00:20:19.223
why should we be afraid of facing the reality,

00:20:19.223 --> 00:20:21.723
which is so beautiful.

00:20:21.727 --> 00:20:25.233
There was a gentleman in Paris

00:20:25.233 --> 00:20:27.733
who got his Realisation and two days he was

00:20:27.733 --> 00:20:30.032
just laughing out of joy and he said,

00:20:30.032 --> 00:20:32.052
“I’ve never laughed all my life

00:20:32.052 --> 00:20:34.192
as I have laughed now” and just out of joy

00:20:34.192 --> 00:20:36.692
he was laughing;

00:20:36.692 --> 00:20:39.552
so joyous. He said, "Mother let me laugh now

00:20:39.552 --> 00:20:42.382
and enjoy myself, I'm really living."

00:20:42.382 --> 00:20:44.107
Actually he told me that he never believed

00:20:44.117 --> 00:20:46.137
in God, to begin with.

00:20:46.144 --> 00:20:49.132
He thought he was a very rational being.

00:20:49.152 --> 00:20:55.462
I said, rational beings are still half,

00:20:55.482 --> 00:20:57.504
because they are dealing with something

00:20:57.504 --> 00:21:01.299
so limited, is rationality.

00:21:05.704 --> 00:21:08.829
We have to cross these barriers of rationality,

00:21:08.854 --> 00:21:11.354
and something is already within you,

00:21:11.354 --> 00:21:13.854
God has placed within you because it is his

00:21:13.854 --> 00:21:17.198
desire that you should know Him,

00:21:17.198 --> 00:21:19.464
that His power should flow through you

00:21:19.468 --> 00:21:23.094
and that you should be the citizen of His kingdom,

00:21:23.094 --> 00:21:25.364
that He is your generous Father and He's

00:21:25.408 --> 00:21:30.929
and He has made all these arrangements for you.

00:21:30.928 --> 00:21:35.138
Now, 75% people sitting here are Realised Souls.

00:21:35.183 --> 00:21:42.608
I’m so very happy, because I struggled
with six of them for four years.

00:21:42.618 --> 00:21:47.878
It is such a remarkable thing

00:21:47.901 --> 00:21:51.538
but it is very, very hard for people to believe

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:55.328
that you have to get an experience of God,

00:21:55.328 --> 00:21:59.247
you have to feel Him within yourself.

00:21:59.274 --> 00:22:06.197
As an actualisation, you have to
feel Him in your conscious mind.

00:22:06.217 --> 00:22:09.297
Because if religion gets organised

00:22:09.297 --> 00:22:13.170
you also get beliefs organised.

00:22:13.187 --> 00:22:16.837
Then, whatever they say becomes perfect;

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:21.755
blind leading the blind.

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:28.285
You cannot organise God, you cannot.

00:22:28.325 --> 00:22:31.835
He will organise.

00:22:31.855 --> 00:22:35.485
You cannot conceive Him.

00:22:35.505 --> 00:22:38.785
He has to conceive you.

00:22:38.785 --> 00:22:41.935
His Grace must come on you.

00:22:41.945 --> 00:22:46.255
You have to ask for his Grace.

00:22:46.275 --> 00:22:50.275
He has already placed His desire within you.

00:22:50.297 --> 00:22:55.265
And this desire resides as Kundalini.

00:22:55.263 --> 00:22:59.656
You have heard so much about
Kundalini before also, I believe.

00:22:59.656 --> 00:23:01.633
Maybe you must have read some horrible books,

00:23:01.643 --> 00:23:03.453
which are shown, to Me,

00:23:03.473 --> 00:23:05.623
that this Kundalini gives you jerks,

00:23:05.613 --> 00:23:08.113
and you start jumping and you start making

00:23:08.113 --> 00:23:11.428
noises and things like that.

00:23:11.413 --> 00:23:13.913
At the very outset, I must tell you

00:23:13.913 --> 00:23:17.883
that it is the desire of God, which is your Mother.

00:23:17.903 --> 00:23:23.687
And this Mother is your own Mother

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.973
You do not have

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.003
any other Mother but this Mother

00:23:28.003 --> 00:23:32.507
and She does not have any child but you.

00:23:32.508 --> 00:23:34.143
Do you think such a Mother

00:23:34.143 --> 00:23:37.263
who has been waiting to give you this rebirth

00:23:37.263 --> 00:23:41.273
would be in any way troublesome to you?

00:23:41.283 --> 00:23:46.943
Even your physical mother bore all the pains
upon herself to give you birth.

00:23:46.943 --> 00:23:52.786
Then why should this Mother try to trouble you?

00:23:52.786 --> 00:23:58.193
Then people asked Me, "Then how did
these people talk of these things?

00:23:58.193 --> 00:23:59.551
I mean you can talk of anything

00:23:59.526 --> 00:24:02.941
if you want to befool people.

00:24:02.956 --> 00:24:06.186
If you want to befool people, can’t you?

00:24:06.206 --> 00:24:09.396
I mean, if you indulge into such a thing you
can. You can get possessed by somebody

00:24:09.396 --> 00:24:14.165
also, that you start writing all these nonsensical things.

00:24:16.036 --> 00:24:17.656
So many mythical things have been written

00:24:17.614 --> 00:24:21.176
apart from that, those who write that Kundalini
gives you jerks and all that

00:24:21.206 --> 00:24:25.596
maybe the people, who were something like
villagers coming and touching the electricity

00:24:25.596 --> 00:24:32.156
at a wrong point and getting a shock and maligning
the electricity, maybe the unauthorised people,

00:24:32.165 --> 00:24:34.665
who did not know anything about Kundalini.

00:24:34.665 --> 00:24:40.225
For Kundalini can only be awakened by an authorised
person who is authorised by God.

00:24:40.236 --> 00:24:47.746
not by theological college or by any Pandit
or by any Ayurveda school or anything.

00:24:47.754 --> 00:24:51.186
Christ never went to any theological college.

00:24:56.274 --> 00:24:59.246
It cannot be done by any such person

00:24:59.246 --> 00:25:02.656
who says he will read books and raise the Kundalini.

00:25:02.676 --> 00:25:05.176
It’s not the mechanism that works out that way.

00:25:05.176 --> 00:25:08.596
You cannot even sprout a seed by reading.

00:25:08.582 --> 00:25:11.082
Can you?

00:25:11.082 --> 00:25:15.006
You have done nothing living by reading.

00:25:17.262 --> 00:25:22.327
How can you raise Kundalini by reading?

00:25:25.648 --> 00:25:32.734
This is in your every day-to-day life we really
lack sometimes common sense.

00:25:34.053 --> 00:25:40.753
We go and read something,

00:25:40.764 --> 00:25:47.193
we think by reading something we are going
to go to God,

00:25:47.193 --> 00:25:52.685
or we then sit down and discuss about it.

00:25:52.682 --> 00:25:56.522
You cannot do anything by this reading, which
is just a dead thing!

00:25:56.542 --> 00:26:00.762
All your arguments, everything is dead.

00:26:00.756 --> 00:26:04.906
It is not yet enlightened; otherwise every word
could be living.

00:26:04.926 --> 00:26:06.826
That’s the Mantra.

00:26:06.842 --> 00:26:11.176
The word that is living is the Mantra.

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:16.460
These holy words,

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.980
if spoken by a person who is not enlightened

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.250
has no meaning at all.

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:24.620
If it is spoken by a person, who is enlightened,

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:27.850
because enlightenment
means he is related to God

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:30.330
and he can address to God

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:32.830
like you get connected.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:40.975
All right, if it is done, done, nothing to worry.

00:26:40.984 --> 00:26:43.484
Nothing to feel bad, if some people have been

00:26:43.484 --> 00:26:45.984
very fanatically involved into it,

00:26:45.985 --> 00:26:47.826
it doesn’t matter.

00:26:47.885 --> 00:26:51.236
Makes no difference at all today, I feel.

00:26:51.265 --> 00:26:53.456
All kinds of things, whatever are done are done

00:26:53.466 --> 00:26:55.536
in the past, finished.

00:26:55.536 --> 00:26:58.036
We have to get our Realisation.

00:26:58.036 --> 00:27:00.536
We have to actualise ourselves.

00:27:00.536 --> 00:27:01.921
This is the main point.

00:27:01.921 --> 00:27:03.791
We are seeking ourselves.

00:27:03.791 --> 00:27:05.691
Unless and until you realise yourself

00:27:05.691 --> 00:27:08.781
you don’t have to even believe in Me,

00:27:08.781 --> 00:27:11.281
but you should not deny Me.

00:27:12.645 --> 00:27:19.016
I would not like anybody to believe in Me, blindly,

00:27:19.016 --> 00:27:24.695
because blind people cannot get it.

00:27:24.696 --> 00:27:27.849
But you should not be also closed

00:27:27.856 --> 00:27:32.539
because closed people also cannot get it.

00:27:32.556 --> 00:27:36.318
When you get it then you must believe,

00:27:36.316 --> 00:27:38.475
that is what is called as 'Shraddha.'

00:27:38.466 --> 00:27:41.385
In Sanskrit language, there two things are;

00:27:41.396 --> 00:27:49.004
one is blind faith and another is Shraddha,

00:27:49.004 --> 00:27:53.244
that is faith, pure faith.

00:27:53.244 --> 00:27:57.324
But in English we have to use an adjective

00:27:57.364 --> 00:27:59.704
that blind faith and faith.

00:27:59.714 --> 00:28:02.056
But people are so confused that they forget

00:28:02.054 --> 00:28:03.626
the adjective of blind,

00:28:03.614 --> 00:28:06.256
and they think my faith is... If your faith is that

00:28:06.256 --> 00:28:11.730
one has to accept it.

00:28:11.746 --> 00:28:15.826
But your faith should be such that it is based

00:28:15.836 --> 00:28:22.114
on the truth.

00:28:22.116 --> 00:28:28.074
Then you become an enlightened person.

00:28:28.081 --> 00:28:30.937
After all God has made us into human beings,

00:28:30.941 --> 00:28:32.947
He has given us this nose, eyes, everything.

00:28:32.947 --> 00:28:35.447
We have done nothing about it.

00:28:35.447 --> 00:28:40.750
And if He has made us for a purpose, He is going
to connect us, He is going to do it.

00:28:40.741 --> 00:28:41.904
It’s His job

00:28:41.904 --> 00:28:46.034
If He does not do it, He will have no meaning,
His creation will have no meaning.

00:28:46.034 --> 00:28:49.374
It is His job!

00:28:52.873 --> 00:28:57.877
And besides that somebody else wants to do
it for you, why should you worry?

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.400
Once you get it, you can do it, too.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:09.550
Like one light enlightened can
enlighten another light, you can do it.

00:29:09.565 --> 00:29:13.880
Today I wanted to talk a little bit,

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:18.400
because 75 % are Sahaja Yogis, who are Realised
Souls and who know Sahaja Yoga, they have

00:29:18.411 --> 00:29:22.890
given Realisation to so many, they have cured
people and I mean they are just there.

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:30.458
And I was very happy that in Paris so many
of them achieved their Nirvikalpa,

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:34.910
which is... we call as the Doubtless Awareness.

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:39.520
The first state is the Thoughtless Awareness.

00:29:39.529 --> 00:29:44.340
Awareness means, 'Enlightened
Awareness,' you can say,

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:50.749
'Samadhi' is the one where your awareness
becomes enlightened.

00:29:50.751 --> 00:29:54.936
The first state is of Thoughtless Awareness.

00:29:54.951 --> 00:29:58.846
And then you jump into your Realisation,

00:29:58.856 --> 00:30:03.236
but still the state is not established.

00:30:03.251 --> 00:30:11.001
You mature then as Doubtless Awareness,

00:30:11.013 --> 00:30:17.003
and this Doubtless Awareness is a state, is not
a thing. “Now I have no doubts about Sahaja

00:30:17.013 --> 00:30:21.433
Yoga”, that’s not the way. It's a state,

00:30:21.443 --> 00:30:27.763
where the rhythm of these vibrations,
or the rhythm of these radiations

00:30:27.743 --> 00:30:32.329
achieve a certain depth and a rhythm,

00:30:32.326 --> 00:30:39.196
which then you yourself start seeing that these
doubts are something separate and you build

00:30:39.206 --> 00:30:46.526
up your own reserve against them. It's not
mental state, it is the state of the being.

00:30:46.547 --> 00:30:55.017
You can say a seed becoming a fruit

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.520
and maturing,

00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:00.612
or you can say a flower becoming a fruit

00:31:00.606 --> 00:31:04.642
and then the fruit maturing.

00:31:04.645 --> 00:31:07.836
In this way, first you get your Self Realisation

00:31:07.836 --> 00:31:10.336
and you get your Thoughtless Awareness.

00:31:10.336 --> 00:31:13.516
And then you get your Doubtless Awareness.

00:31:13.504 --> 00:31:15.896
But people who are not complicated so much,

00:31:15.896 --> 00:31:19.106
uncomplicated people, simple people,

00:31:19.086 --> 00:31:22.046
PART OF SHRI MATAJI'S TALK IS MISSING

00:31:22.071 --> 00:31:24.537
chakras are alright,  or not you start verifying it

00:31:24.537 --> 00:31:26.317
through your brain.

00:31:26.327 --> 00:31:29.157
You go round and round and round.

00:31:29.185 --> 00:31:32.657
That's why the first thing you get is...

00:31:32.665 --> 00:31:38.150
your attention gets enlightened.

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:42.690
You put your attention to someone and you
know about that person on your fingers.

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:48.090
You can feel their centres and then you know
through decoding what centres.

00:31:48.102 --> 00:31:54.320
Supposing somebody is having a heart-attack
or something you can feel it on this finger,

00:31:54.339 --> 00:31:59.317
a heat, or a kind of a spasm,
sometimes and sometimes numbness.

00:31:59.327 --> 00:32:04.636
If a person is going to die, you feel a numbness
in all your fingers. There are many things

00:32:04.656 --> 00:32:09.144
which decode it. Apart from physical
you have got also emotional problems

00:32:09.124 --> 00:32:14.404
which can be found out. The left side suggest
the emotional problem and the right side

00:32:14.398 --> 00:32:16.898
the physical and the mental problem.

00:32:16.898 --> 00:32:19.491
If a person is egoistical,

00:32:19.496 --> 00:32:24.689
if his ego is hurt, anyway if there's a problem
with his ego somehow or other

00:32:24.701 --> 00:32:30.494
in any way, then you get this
finger catching very much.

00:32:30.504 --> 00:32:34.284
But after getting Realisation, you
don't feel bad if somebody says,

00:32:34.282 --> 00:32:36.782
“Mother, my Agnya here is catching.”

00:32:36.782 --> 00:32:39.054
All right, you say it, you don’t feel bad about it.

00:32:39.032 --> 00:32:41.039
You say, "All right, clear it out!"

00:32:41.035 --> 00:32:45.489
This centre is that of Christ.

00:32:45.485 --> 00:32:47.985
Even many people who call themselves Christians

00:32:47.985 --> 00:32:51.989
have the same Agnya as the Jews
have and as the Muslims have.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.929
One because they are unauthorised

00:32:55.925 --> 00:33:00.007
that’s why Christ is angry, another
because they are criticising Christ.

00:33:00.017 --> 00:33:04.637
Both ways it is just the same.

00:33:04.651 --> 00:33:10.067
Christ wants, or anyone of them, they want
that you should realise them, you should feel

00:33:10.042 --> 00:33:15.217
them, you should know them.

00:33:17.977 --> 00:33:24.277
Today specially for the Sahaja Yogis I
wanted to discuss the right side very much,

00:33:24.301 --> 00:33:31.691
because so far, we have not dealt with it very
much. Normally we got people who were

00:33:31.691 --> 00:33:34.671
on the left side, on the emotional problem.

00:33:34.683 --> 00:33:40.273
The right side is called also as Prana Shakti,

00:33:40.268 --> 00:33:44.658
means the vital power of life.

00:33:44.643 --> 00:33:48.598
And the left side is called as Mana Shakti.

00:33:48.604 --> 00:33:51.104
Now this Prana Shakti,

00:33:51.114 --> 00:33:56.335
which is on the right-hand side...

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.820
What's happened?

00:34:00.969 --> 00:34:03.469
There's some noise somewhere.

00:34:05.334 --> 00:34:08.225
The Prana Shakti within us

00:34:08.241 --> 00:34:13.015
comes to us through five elements.

00:34:13.011 --> 00:34:20.245
The five elements are, as you know,

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:24.935
is, one of them is the earth,

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.955
then we have got the water,

00:34:26.970 --> 00:34:30.760
then we have got the air,

00:34:30.779 --> 00:34:33.279
then we have got the light

00:34:33.307 --> 00:34:35.807
and then we have got the ether.

00:34:35.807 --> 00:34:38.307
These five elements are there.

00:34:38.332 --> 00:34:43.849
Out of these five elements our body is made.

00:34:43.874 --> 00:34:54.189
These five elements create five cocoons around
us. And that’s how we have got five auras within us.

00:34:54.199 --> 00:35:00.489
These five auras can be
detected by some machines

00:35:00.493 --> 00:35:05.209
because these machines are

00:35:05.209 --> 00:35:14.579
able to detect only the right side

00:35:14.579 --> 00:35:18.579
as they deal with matter.

00:35:18.589 --> 00:35:27.464
The whole of the matter is created by these five
energies and they have also a casual energy behind

00:35:27.454 --> 00:35:32.351
it. And these casual energies actually make that.

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:38.765
For example: the causal
energy of earth is fragrance.

00:35:38.758 --> 00:35:44.211
From the fragrance earth is created.

00:35:44.218 --> 00:35:46.718
Now, within us all these five centres

00:35:46.718 --> 00:35:53.652
that you see

00:35:53.664 --> 00:36:01.742
these are, these five up to
here, are made of five elements.

00:36:01.742 --> 00:36:04.985
The body of those centres are made of

00:36:04.985 --> 00:36:09.157
only the body part, I am saying
– of those five elements.

00:36:09.143 --> 00:36:18.547
And the Deities residing in those centres
are also born from those five elements.

00:36:18.547 --> 00:36:22.747
Because they were born of a particular element,

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:35.512
they concentrated more on that and maintained
the knowledge more limited to that area,

00:36:35.527 --> 00:36:38.592
which dealt with that particular element.

00:36:38.586 --> 00:36:46.620
For example, we can say the green thing is the
one that represents the water, water element.

00:36:46.632 --> 00:36:53.130
This centre in the stomach is
the water element within us.

00:36:53.135 --> 00:36:56.175
It is called as Nabhi Chakra

00:36:56.185 --> 00:36:59.765
and around it is called as the
Bhavasaghara, you can say the Void

00:36:59.765 --> 00:37:02.055
or you can say the Gap, or whatever you may say,

00:37:02.055 --> 00:37:06.355
the whole world as such, within us.

00:37:06.377 --> 00:37:15.445
So the people who were born on
this centre, around this centre,

00:37:15.425 --> 00:37:21.791
were born out of water element.

00:37:21.791 --> 00:37:28.575
In this Bhavasaghra, Bhavasaghra
means the ocean of this world

00:37:28.585 --> 00:37:36.342
were born, through this ocean of the world,
were born all the Primordial Masters

00:37:36.353 --> 00:37:38.582
one after another,

00:37:38.583 --> 00:37:42.849
we can say Abraham, Moses,

00:37:42.849 --> 00:37:49.559
we had Janaka, we had Adi Nath and Socrates

00:37:49.573 --> 00:37:52.529
and so many others like that

00:37:52.523 --> 00:37:55.023
Nanaka

00:37:55.023 --> 00:37:59.532
and also very recently we
had about hundred years back

00:37:59.542 --> 00:38:03.769
a very great saint born in India known as Sainath.

00:38:03.769 --> 00:38:08.362
They all represent the same
element, that is the water element,

00:38:08.377 --> 00:38:10.877
being responsible or being born out of that

00:38:10.877 --> 00:38:25.038
they are anxious to maintain water element as the
one which is within us for sustaining ourselves.

00:38:25.028 --> 00:38:29.748
We are sustained by water so they
help us to sustain ourselves.

00:38:29.737 --> 00:38:34.901
They are the sustainers, they tell us
how to sustain, as a human being.

00:38:34.898 --> 00:38:42.683
And all of them have tried to establish religion
within us. A religion doesn’t mean outside,

00:38:42.664 --> 00:38:49.614
but the religion as a man, means the capacity
of a man or you can say, the quality of a man.

00:38:49.633 --> 00:38:52.133
What a human being should be like,

00:38:52.133 --> 00:38:55.907
what is the way to know if
he is a human being or not

00:38:55.897 --> 00:38:59.497
which is described in the Ten Commandments.

00:38:59.497 --> 00:39:05.787
Now the way they have said it is all
misinterpreted and all wrong things have come.

00:39:05.806 --> 00:39:11.666
But one thing is definite, that they have never talked of fanaticism.

00:39:11.661 --> 00:39:14.161
They are against fanaticism.

00:39:14.161 --> 00:39:22.094
They are against alcoholism, because
alcohol spoils the water element very much.

00:39:22.118 --> 00:39:28.558
If you see the effect of alcohol on
water in the blood of human beings

00:39:28.568 --> 00:39:30.708
you will be amazed how

00:39:30.704 --> 00:39:34.094
the neutral position of hydrogen
and oxygen or OH ion

00:39:34.094 --> 00:39:38.174
is absolutely imbalanced by alcohol.

00:39:38.174 --> 00:39:40.873
And water cannot absorb any heat from the liver,

00:39:40.873 --> 00:39:43.373
which sorts out all your poisons.

00:39:43.383 --> 00:39:47.049
And that's how people get bad livers and bad troubles

00:39:47.049 --> 00:39:51.628
and then people would say, "What's wrong?"

00:39:51.628 --> 00:39:55.119
There is nothing wrong as such,
because even nothing wrong in that.

00:39:55.119 --> 00:40:00.858
“What’s wrong according to the theory
of wrong and right of human beings,

00:40:00.868 --> 00:40:04.088
I think nothing is wrong. You can kill
yourself. You can jump from anything.

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:07.781
You can do whatever you like.

00:40:07.781 --> 00:40:11.811
There is nothing wrong. If you break this, if you
break that, if you break anybody, do anything,

00:40:11.831 --> 00:40:16.751
there is nothing wrong what’s wrong with it?

00:40:16.766 --> 00:40:21.078
But there is fundamentally wrong is
that you are created for a purpose.

00:40:21.049 --> 00:40:23.408
You have not created yourself.

00:40:23.422 --> 00:40:26.758
God has created you with such difficulties.

00:40:26.782 --> 00:40:30.968
He has taken you out of

00:40:30.961 --> 00:40:34.558
so many evolutionary processes
and brought you to this stage

00:40:34.546 --> 00:40:40.378
and now you have no business to
kill yourself and destroy yourself.

00:40:40.379 --> 00:40:43.988
This is wrong is that you are destroying
yourself, you are destroying your community

00:40:43.998 --> 00:40:48.248
you are destroying others or
you are destroying yourself.

00:40:48.258 --> 00:40:53.988
If you are destroying yourself also because
you are on your own, you think, "What’s wrong?"

00:40:53.988 --> 00:40:57.298
You are a part and parcel of the whole.

00:40:57.288 --> 00:41:03.068
You are a cell in the whole and
being created to know the whole

00:41:03.058 --> 00:41:06.348
and if you destroy yourself you
are destroying the whole as well.

00:41:06.358 --> 00:41:12.381
You become malignant. You become cancerous

00:41:12.358 --> 00:41:14.858
and that’s why it’s all wrong.

00:41:14.858 --> 00:41:21.167
In anyway if you destroy others or destroy
yourself you have no right to do that.

00:41:21.134 --> 00:41:24.007
God has given you freedom, no doubt.

00:41:24.014 --> 00:41:28.777
By creating ego and superego within
yourself with these activities,

00:41:28.777 --> 00:41:31.047
you become separated from the whole.

00:41:31.042 --> 00:41:34.192
And then you think you are Mr Such and Such.

00:41:34.192 --> 00:41:39.532
And then you stand and say, “I
believe in this, and I believe in...,"

00:41:39.548 --> 00:41:43.958
actually who are you? You are made by God.

00:41:43.968 --> 00:41:46.468
You are His own child.

00:41:46.492 --> 00:41:48.771
Still you are a child.

00:41:48.778 --> 00:41:53.541
It's like a baby saying, "I believe in it, I believe in it."

00:41:55.525 --> 00:41:57.889
You have not known the whole so far.

00:41:57.891 --> 00:42:01.139
How can you say that?

00:42:01.151 --> 00:42:04.649
You have to grow!

00:42:04.661 --> 00:42:08.016
And when you grow, your
freedom is complete,

00:42:08.018 --> 00:42:10.518
absolute.

00:42:10.518 --> 00:42:17.946
But the ideas about this freedom are such
that you are fighting your own innocence

00:42:17.956 --> 00:42:21.786
you are fighting your own sustenance.

00:42:21.796 --> 00:42:30.072
And this sustenance was completely supported

00:42:30.092 --> 00:42:38.382
protected by these great
incarnations of Primordial Masters.

00:42:38.373 --> 00:42:42.216
That’s why they talked against alcohol.

00:42:42.231 --> 00:42:47.851
Christ did not talk about alcohol, all
right – because He was at another point,

00:42:47.851 --> 00:42:51.571
but He did not say that you take alcohol, never.

00:42:51.591 --> 00:42:53.471
People said that He drank wine

00:42:53.471 --> 00:42:56.881
but wine means grape juice in that country,

00:42:56.881 --> 00:42:59.381
it doesn’t mean alcohol.

00:43:02.411 --> 00:43:05.821
How can Christ say, you drink wine,

00:43:05.835 --> 00:43:07.981
which is fermented,

00:43:07.984 --> 00:43:09.931
which will go against your awareness?

00:43:09.931 --> 00:43:12.164
Just think of it!

00:43:12.191 --> 00:43:15.264
It goes against your awareness, isn’t it?

00:43:15.261 --> 00:43:17.464
Your awareness is to be enlightened,

00:43:17.487 --> 00:43:19.987
He came on this earth to enlighten that awareness,

00:43:19.987 --> 00:43:25.020
do you think He will say that you get foggy with it?

00:43:24.997 --> 00:43:29.510
Does it not fog your attention and your awareness,

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:32.010
is a fact.

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:37.750
But He wants to do something else

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:43.686
because He came as Divine Power itself.

00:43:43.767 --> 00:43:46.267
He was the embodiment of Pranava

00:43:46.267 --> 00:43:51.777
not Prana – all powers put together.

00:43:51.775 --> 00:43:57.267
He was the embodiment of OM itself, the Brahma.

00:43:57.279 --> 00:44:00.527
That’s why He came to prove

00:44:00.537 --> 00:44:02.999
what Krishna has said,

00:44:02.999 --> 00:44:06.239
that it cannot be killed by anyone.

00:44:06.252 --> 00:44:08.659
It cannot be blown off,

00:44:08.662 --> 00:44:11.979
it cannot be destroyed.

00:44:11.972 --> 00:44:15.232
His body was made out of that,

00:44:15.252 --> 00:44:20.732
and that’s why He could be resurrected.

00:44:25.082 --> 00:44:26.691
All these things are knowledgeable

00:44:26.691 --> 00:44:28.262
only if you are a realised soul,

00:44:28.262 --> 00:44:31.882
otherwise you cannot understand this.

00:44:31.882 --> 00:44:35.192
Because you have not yet gone into the depth

00:44:35.222 --> 00:44:36.882
of your own understanding,

00:44:36.902 --> 00:44:40.192
you are still children as I say,

00:44:40.182 --> 00:44:43.148
you have to be born again,

00:44:43.162 --> 00:44:50.578
and then you can find out for these vibrations.

00:44:50.561 --> 00:44:54.448
You have to ask just a question,

00:44:54.448 --> 00:45:03.298
“Was Christ embodied with Pranava,

00:45:03.287 --> 00:45:06.323
or the OM, or the Brahma?

00:45:06.318 --> 00:45:10.902
Or was He made of Brahma itself?”

00:45:10.902 --> 00:45:15.512
You will get the cool breeze.

00:45:15.512 --> 00:45:20.842
and that is the sign that He was.

00:45:20.844 --> 00:45:28.154
It is much deeper but the whole
knowledge exists as experience to you.

00:45:28.154 --> 00:45:32.932
The whole of it, it is an experience within us.

00:45:32.924 --> 00:45:36.784
And one has to get that experience of oneself,

00:45:36.809 --> 00:45:39.542
which is knowledge itself

00:45:39.559 --> 00:45:43.778
and then everything trickles down

00:45:43.774 --> 00:45:48.925
just like actual thing within us,
as we see white as white and red as red.

00:45:48.925 --> 00:45:55.255
Animals do not see perhaps,
but human beings do see.

00:45:55.275 --> 00:46:02.755
Thus, our awareness is enlightened.

00:46:02.765 --> 00:46:08.635
I will be talking to other Sahaja Yogis in
the Ashram about the right side later on

00:46:08.658 --> 00:46:12.695
because we have new people, and
they are to be looked after.

00:46:12.733 --> 00:46:21.029
And I think, next time when I
meet, I don’t know when, maybe...

00:46:21.024 --> 00:46:27.804
No, in the Ashram firstly. Thursday evening I think, then
I'll talk to you because Friday I've got to fly out.

00:46:27.796 --> 00:46:30.995
Thursday evening I will
be there most probably.

00:46:33.824 --> 00:46:38.634
So just now, let’s have the
experience for the new ones,

00:46:38.639 --> 00:46:43.814
and for the others also to deepen themselves.
May God bless you.

00:46:46.799 --> 00:46:50.469
All of you should put your
hands just like this, before Me,

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:56.409
and close your eyes, just close your eyes!

00:46:56.409 --> 00:47:01.698
Put the hands like this, you
see and just close your eyes.

00:47:01.712 --> 00:47:06.089
You have to close your eyes because
the Kundalini, when She rises

00:47:06.052 --> 00:47:08.629
on the Agnya Chakra

00:47:08.633 --> 00:47:10.789
the dilatation of the pupil takes place

00:47:10.793 --> 00:47:14.496
and if your eyes are open the dilatation doesn’t take place.

00:47:14.449 --> 00:47:20.689
When people mesmerize they keep your eyes
open, because they put you on the sides.

00:47:20.699 --> 00:47:26.259
I will tell one day how they mesmerise, also.

00:47:28.923 --> 00:47:34.030
First you will feel that there is no thought
in your mind, if you watch your thoughts.

00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:41.250
Then the Kundalini rises about
Agnya, you get Thoughtless Awareness.

00:47:42.563 --> 00:47:49.400
When it pierces the fontenel bone area, I mean
when you get your baptism by your Kundalini,

00:47:49.399 --> 00:47:57.717
then you feel the kind of a cool
breeze coming towards you from me;

00:47:57.726 --> 00:48:07.796
or a kind of a radiation of cool breeze
coming. From all over you might feel it.

00:48:13.107 --> 00:48:19.168
On your hands! Through
your fingers! It works!

00:48:22.798 --> 00:48:25.308
All of you should put your
hands towards me. Please!

00:48:26.848 --> 00:48:29.348
That's important.

00:48:34.303 --> 00:48:41.989
I mean even to put your hands is hard to
request, that means how egotistical you are.

00:48:41.994 --> 00:48:48.732
You've come here for getting your Realisation
and don't even want to put your hands towards me.

00:48:48.753 --> 00:48:54.188
All such people should leave.

00:48:54.208 --> 00:48:58.413
Getting cool breeze?
Great!

00:48:58.413 --> 00:49:00.511
Close you eyes and enjoy yourself.

00:49:00.513 --> 00:49:05.301
Best is to enjoy, this is the greatest
moment you've been waiting for.

00:49:05.309 --> 00:49:10.059
Close you eyes!
Enjoy yourself!
