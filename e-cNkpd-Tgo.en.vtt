WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:05.489
I again see today some new faces

00:05.489 --> 00:08.849
who have come here,

00:10.869 --> 00:15.175
and I have to explain again today,

00:15.175 --> 00:20.205
for the first time to them,

00:20.215 --> 00:25.752
what is Sahaja Yoga,

00:25.755 --> 00:30.733
which has been promised in various scriptures

00:30.745 --> 00:37.005
that you have to get your Second Birth.

00:37.026 --> 00:39.526
You have to be born again.

00:39.515 --> 00:43.328
It is said. Christ has said too,

00:43.318 --> 00:45.818
the same thing.

00:47.870 --> 00:51.860
But people have not been able to ponder

00:51.866 --> 00:58.930
on this subject: what does that mean – our Second Birth?

00:58.912 --> 01:03.172
Are we not already born as human beings?

01:03.172 --> 01:06.452
We are born

01:06.462 --> 01:08.914
but the human beings, which are born,

01:08.913 --> 01:12.092
are told that you are to be 'born again.'

01:12.082 --> 01:14.874
Now what are we going to do?

01:14.874 --> 01:19.884
So they asked, "Are we to enter
into our mother's womb again?

01:19.865 --> 01:23.564
And are to be born again?"

01:23.570 --> 01:30.630
He said, :You'll be born of the
Holy Ghost, of the Holy Spirit."

01:30.644 --> 01:36.640
The Holy Ghost that He talked
about is the Kundalini within us.

01:36.651 --> 01:39.151
She is the part of the Holy Ghost,

01:39.151 --> 01:42.573
or you can say the reflection of the Holy Ghost,

01:42.593 --> 01:48.773
which exists as all-pervading power.

01:48.797 --> 01:54.227
Actually the all-pervading power of Divine Love

01:54.230 --> 02:00.244
is the love of Holy Ghost or Her aura.

02:00.238 --> 02:06.774
This is reflected within us, as the power of desire

02:08.598 --> 02:17.995
as shown in the picture in
the triangular bone of sacrum

02:17.986 --> 02:21.305
and coils itself in three and a half rounds.

02:27.186 --> 02:32.826
If you could ask the child to play there,
it would be better. Whose child is this?

02:36.838 --> 02:41.165
Children don't understand all, they
need not understand. They are all right.

02:41.165 --> 02:45.085
They're realised. They're enjoying themselves.

02:53.376 --> 02:58.817
This force, which is called as residual force,

02:58.799 --> 03:02.597
is the desire of God,

03:02.575 --> 03:13.035
which resides within us in a dormant way.

03:13.036 --> 03:17.368
We actually do not know what is the desire of God.

03:17.385 --> 03:18.896
We have our own conclusions,

03:18.889 --> 03:20.256
our own conceptions,

03:20.257 --> 03:23.438
our own ideas that I am doing the work of God.

03:23.469 --> 03:25.219
But you are not yet connected with God,

03:25.219 --> 03:28.219
how can you do the work of God?

03:28.204 --> 03:30.704
There is no way of really establishing

03:30.704 --> 03:33.204
any actual rapport with God,

03:33.204 --> 03:36.159
and how can you say that you are related to God

03:36.159 --> 03:38.659
or you are doing the work of God?

03:38.659 --> 03:42.317
It’s all right that God is looking after you,

03:42.317 --> 03:44.227
He is managing you,

03:44.227 --> 03:46.889
He has given you this life, is correct.

03:46.889 --> 03:51.841
But there is no way of finding God

03:51.847 --> 03:53.911
in your conscious mind.

03:53.897 --> 03:56.397
It's just your mental activity

03:56.397 --> 03:58.897
maybe your ego,

03:58.897 --> 04:02.363
which says, "I am God."

04:02.357 --> 04:06.685
Some people say, "I like it!"

04:06.687 --> 04:09.187
But why do you like it?

04:09.187 --> 04:11.295
Because I think, I like it.

04:11.327 --> 04:15.165
Then, why, whatever you think is your own.

04:15.165 --> 04:16.835
It is not God’s,

04:16.845 --> 04:26.565
how do you say, with such cock-sure attitude

04:26.569 --> 04:30.805
that you are connected with God?

04:30.810 --> 04:33.001
Then they will start discussing about it.

04:32.983 --> 04:35.483
They sit down and talk about it

04:35.483 --> 04:39.183
Yesterday only we had a very funny visitor in Paris

04:39.183 --> 04:43.383
and he started it like a tape record

04:43.393 --> 04:47.193
and he just started telling Me what he thinks.

04:47.205 --> 04:50.653
But your thinking is your own imagination.

04:50.640 --> 04:53.140
There is no actual experience in it.

04:53.154 --> 04:56.606
There is no actuality.

04:56.616 --> 05:00.546
I said, "This is fanaticism."

05:00.533 --> 05:03.033
When you start thinking about something

05:03.033 --> 05:07.624
and accept it as real, then it is fanaticism,

05:07.628 --> 05:08.634
of any kind.

05:08.628 --> 05:13.446
You can be a football fanatic.

05:13.456 --> 05:16.206
You think that a particular person must win.

05:16.206 --> 05:18.706
It becomes sort of your thinking.

05:18.706 --> 05:21.206
Then that person must win, if he does not win

05:21.206 --> 05:24.656
then you are going to kill everybody else.

05:24.656 --> 05:26.776
If you go a little further with it,

05:26.776 --> 05:35.678
you think that you are a great benevolent person.

05:35.675 --> 05:37.488
Then whatever you think,

05:37.505 --> 05:38.848
you feel that this is the thing

05:38.798 --> 05:41.838
that is going to bring benevolence to people.

05:41.848 --> 05:43.928
but what is the proof?

05:43.928 --> 05:50.642
That what you think is the thing wanted by God.

05:50.658 --> 05:51.868
All your thinking

05:51.868 --> 05:58.528
is based either on your conditioning,

05:58.518 --> 05:59.648
whatever you have read,

05:59.658 --> 06:01.499
if you are born a Christian all your thinking

06:01.488 --> 06:03.249
will be Christian thinking means church's

06:03.238 --> 06:05.738
thinking not God's thinking.

06:05.743 --> 06:09.219
If you are a Hindu, you will think like a Hindu

06:09.219 --> 06:11.719
of a temple or some sort of a Guru

06:11.719 --> 06:14.219
or somebody who has taught you something.

06:14.219 --> 06:18.940
If you are a Muslim you might become Khomeini

06:18.979 --> 06:21.479
anything is possible!

06:21.479 --> 06:23.029
Are we going in the same direction

06:23.029 --> 06:24.910
with our thinking?

06:24.893 --> 06:28.900
Or are we related to God?

06:28.903 --> 06:31.890
First, relationship with God must be established.

06:31.890 --> 06:34.390
That is extremely important

06:34.390 --> 06:36.890
before we talk of God

06:36.890 --> 06:40.653
because all our thinking is our conditioning

06:40.653 --> 06:44.572
or else our imagination.

06:44.563 --> 06:45.902
There are some people who met Me

06:45.899 --> 06:48.022
they said they have met God.

06:48.022 --> 06:50.522
I said, "Really?  How, how does he look like?"

06:50.522 --> 06:52.582
"Oh, I met him on the street."

06:52.602 --> 06:53.632
I said, "Very good."

06:53.632 --> 06:56.132
And somebody says, "I am Christ."

06:56.132 --> 06:58.632
Somebody says, "I am Krishna."

06:58.632 --> 07:02.877
But what is the proof?

07:02.872 --> 07:05.372
I mean, supposing I say this is gold.

07:05.372 --> 07:07.627
Then gold has a density.

07:07.632 --> 07:09.877
You can find out whether it is gold or silver

07:09.858 --> 07:12.127
or something but you cannot just go on saying,

07:12.127 --> 07:18.380
“I think it is gold." So it becomes gold, can it?

07:18.397 --> 07:20.560
In the same way our faith,

07:20.557 --> 07:24.680
because we think we have a belief in it,

07:24.697 --> 07:27.740
is mythical – as far as you are concerned,

07:27.740 --> 07:29.965
as far as anybody else is concerned.

07:29.980 --> 07:32.480
Unless and until you give the proof of God,

07:32.480 --> 07:34.655
nobody is going to believe in God any further,

07:34.655 --> 07:36.375
I can tell you this much.

07:36.375 --> 07:37.335
And this is the reason

07:37.302 --> 07:39.395
another mythical stuff is coming up

07:39.395 --> 07:40.875
is that there is no God.

07:40.851 --> 07:44.845
This is another myth.

07:44.851 --> 07:47.351
Either to believe that you are connected with God

07:47.351 --> 07:49.851
is equally mythical as to say there is no God.

07:49.851 --> 07:51.535
Because if you have not met Him

07:51.471 --> 07:53.351
how do you say, there is not? There may be,

07:53.328 --> 07:57.081
may not be – is a better situation.

07:57.087 --> 07:59.587
Just to denounce Him that there is no God,

07:59.587 --> 08:02.087
is another myth.

08:02.087 --> 08:04.587
We some how or other managed to live with a myth.

08:04.587 --> 08:08.774
It’s very comfortable to live with myth.

08:08.777 --> 08:10.524
It’s a comfortable life; we do not want to

08:10.505 --> 08:12.264
give up our comforts.

08:12.264 --> 08:14.394
As just now, I was telling someone

08:14.394 --> 08:18.244
that a little shell contains a little oyster in it.

08:18.244 --> 08:21.226
Now, the oyster doesn’t want to get out of the shell.

08:21.226 --> 08:23.726
It’s quite comfortable.

08:23.726 --> 08:27.594
And a little bit of a sand comes in

08:27.599 --> 08:36.550
and it sat troubling the comfort of the oyster.

08:36.564 --> 08:41.380
So, oyster takes out his saliva

08:41.410 --> 08:44.150
goes round it, makes it softer,

08:44.150 --> 08:47.080
puts it there, curls up a little bit of its body

08:47.080 --> 08:48.896
and says, “Now I am comfortable now I'm

08:48.910 --> 08:50.336
very satisfied, it’s all right.

08:50.340 --> 08:52.316
The shell is the thing for me."

08:52.320 --> 08:54.820
And that’s how we go on living with the shell

08:54.820 --> 08:57.696
avoiding understanding

08:57.706 --> 09:03.816
that this shell is not the thing we are seeking.

09:03.836 --> 09:08.026
So, one has to get out of that
comfortable feeling one has.

09:08.040 --> 09:10.540
If you have a house, very nice!

09:10.540 --> 09:12.505
I’ve got children, very nice!

09:12.490 --> 09:14.990
I’ve got a wife, I’ve got a car. It's all right.

09:14.990 --> 09:19.615
I am very comfortable, I am very satisfied.

09:22.740 --> 09:27.824
But then, certain calamities come in.

09:27.814 --> 09:31.044
You are faced with them.

09:31.040 --> 09:34.274
Problems come in

09:34.300 --> 09:38.746
and then you think,

09:38.750 --> 09:41.250
"I never waited for this.

09:41.266 --> 09:43.766
It was most unexpected."

09:46.046 --> 09:49.347
There are another set of people,

09:49.366 --> 09:54.397
who think – who ‘think’, again!

09:54.406 --> 10:02.366
that they have to search God.

10:02.386 --> 10:08.857
And that’s how they jump into sea.

10:08.866 --> 10:11.027
They jump into fire,

10:11.031 --> 10:11.997
they jump into water,

10:11.997 --> 10:13.897
they jump into all kinds of things

10:13.897 --> 10:19.088
without understanding what danger it entails.

10:19.108 --> 10:21.548
So one side we have a comfortably coiled up

10:21.538 --> 10:23.768
an oyster and another is an oyster

10:23.778 --> 10:25.588
which is burnt up

10:25.559 --> 10:33.555
which is either drowned or something.

10:33.568 --> 10:39.905
So what should a human being do?

10:39.915 --> 10:44.445
He should be comfortable,

10:44.445 --> 10:46.675
but all the time he should think that

10:46.674 --> 10:50.955
“I have not yet met God, I must meet.

10:50.955 --> 10:53.414
I have to watch and see,

10:53.424 --> 10:57.204
I have to understand."

10:57.204 --> 10:59.704
Oyster in the shell

10:59.704 --> 11:03.608
is better sometimes

11:03.608 --> 11:09.478
than the oyster, which is completely fried out.

11:09.478 --> 11:11.978
But the oyster in the shell

11:11.978 --> 11:14.478
will die its own death.

11:14.478 --> 11:17.433
But there is a possibility about the oyster

11:17.433 --> 11:19.933
which has come out that he might meet

11:19.933 --> 11:22.883
something.

11:22.872 --> 11:26.296
Because he is a seeker

11:26.296 --> 11:29.716
God also looks after him,

11:29.739 --> 11:33.786
God also wants to help.

11:33.806 --> 11:36.226
If he could listen to his own unconscious,

11:36.246 --> 11:39.296
he could work it out.

11:42.276 --> 11:46.221
Sahaja Yoga is not a new thing.

11:46.256 --> 11:48.461
Sahaja means ‘spontaneous’.

11:48.466 --> 11:50.966
Everything that happens in life is spontaneous.

11:51.536 --> 11:53.576
From amoeba to this stage, you have come

11:53.576 --> 11:58.206
spontaneously, 'Sahaja,' born with you.

11:58.206 --> 12:01.506
It is within you!

12:06.706 --> 12:10.812
Gradually, as a seed sprouts into a flower

12:10.812 --> 12:13.312
and then the fragrance starts emitting out

12:13.312 --> 12:14.488
from the flower,

12:14.488 --> 12:21.332
in the same way it is all built in you.

12:21.332 --> 12:26.636
You don’t have to go anywhere, it is between

12:26.635 --> 12:29.776
your own thinking

12:29.795 --> 12:36.366
and your desiring, it resides.

12:38.916 --> 12:42.256
You desire something

12:42.266 --> 12:45.656
and you don’t think about it

12:45.676 --> 12:48.732
that is the best way you can do.

12:48.732 --> 12:51.232
We have two capacities within us,

12:51.232 --> 12:55.779
one is to desire. With this left side,

12:55.793 --> 13:02.339
the deep blue coloured channel within us,

13:02.349 --> 13:04.499
the desire.

13:04.519 --> 13:06.459
It manifests outside

13:06.459 --> 13:17.033
as left sympathetic nervous system,

13:17.013 --> 13:21.773
which is our emotional side,

13:21.773 --> 13:26.933
which is responsible for collecting all our past,

13:26.932 --> 13:29.166
all our experiences, all our conditioning.

13:29.166 --> 13:31.143
This is the psyche about which

13:31.156 --> 13:35.622
the psychologists are worried.

13:35.623 --> 13:38.812
So, we desire.

13:38.802 --> 13:43.272
And the right side one, the yellow coloured line

13:43.292 --> 13:47.302
represents the power by which we maintain

13:47.295 --> 13:49.795
our physical being

13:49.795 --> 13:55.749
and ultimately we start thinking.

13:55.755 --> 13:59.699
Between these two resides

13:59.699 --> 14:02.209
the power of our evolution.

14:04.289 --> 14:06.235
So we have left side and right side

14:06.269 --> 14:08.065
sympathetic nervous system,

14:08.069 --> 14:10.569
manifested in the gross, and in the centre

14:10.569 --> 14:13.365
is the parasympathetic.

14:13.379 --> 14:15.415
Parasympathetic is a system

14:15.409 --> 14:17.909
which shows how much we have evolved so far.

14:17.909 --> 14:20.652
How much we have achieved so far up to

14:20.662 --> 14:23.532
human level.

14:23.555 --> 14:26.055
Only human beings think that

14:26.055 --> 14:32.571
they have to achieve God, not animals.

14:32.575 --> 14:34.590
They have reached that state that they think

14:34.561 --> 14:36.094
that they have to achieve God,

14:36.091 --> 14:39.734
they desire that they have to achieve God.

14:39.741 --> 14:45.796
There is a gap between their achievement

14:45.794 --> 14:48.736
and there is the desire.

14:48.751 --> 14:52.842
This is to be crossed.

14:52.842 --> 14:58.762
But their desire cannot work it out,

14:58.752 --> 15:03.082
only their desire can call for the help from God,

15:03.082 --> 15:05.582
and the God’s desire is within you

15:05.582 --> 15:10.202
in this triangular bone lying dormant.

15:10.212 --> 15:15.562
This God’s desire is called as Kundalini.

15:15.572 --> 15:18.072
That God’s desire has to rise within you,

15:18.072 --> 15:23.185
and it is He who has to give you the Second Birth

15:23.205 --> 15:25.195
or you can say that the She, the Mother,

15:25.205 --> 15:28.513
has to give you the Second Birth.

15:28.513 --> 15:30.627
This is the Holy Ghost

15:30.643 --> 15:33.143
about which Christ could not talk

15:33.143 --> 15:36.737
to those mad people who really crucified Him.

15:36.743 --> 15:41.417
They were mad that they thought that Christ

15:41.427 --> 15:46.809
was blasphemous.

15:46.809 --> 15:48.349
Just think of it!

15:48.349 --> 15:50.439
And today we have churches and people,

15:50.439 --> 15:52.939
and this and that.

15:56.029 --> 15:58.069
When He lived nobody accepted Him,

15:58.069 --> 16:02.259
nobody recognised Him

16:02.259 --> 16:04.209
When He came, they talked of Moses,

16:04.209 --> 16:08.599
Abraham.

16:08.599 --> 16:11.099
It is very nice to handle Christ,

16:11.069 --> 16:13.329
better talk about them, so that  we don't have

16:13.329 --> 16:15.829
to face reality.

16:15.829 --> 16:18.329
Because if they had recognised Christ

16:18.329 --> 16:20.001
then Christ would have said, "All right

16:19.948 --> 16:22.078
if you are recognising Me, then get your

16:22.078 --> 16:27.108
Realisation

16:27.121 --> 16:29.505
and understand yourself.”

16:29.491 --> 16:31.525
They where not prepared for this.

16:31.531 --> 16:33.755
Only twelve people somehow – you see

16:33.741 --> 16:36.241
managed to be there, somehow.

16:36.241 --> 16:42.691
They would not accept Him either.

16:42.681 --> 16:46.761
Till He was resurrected

16:46.751 --> 16:50.861
then they accepted Him, in a way.

16:50.881 --> 16:52.531
And then, what are you going to do

16:52.539 --> 16:56.191
but to create a myth around it.

16:56.199 --> 16:57.759
And to say that, “Of course,

16:57.759 --> 16:58.989
we believed in Christ.”

16:59.002 --> 17:02.205
Now what, which Christ did you believe in?

17:02.215 --> 17:05.435
Because that Christ, whom you had to face

17:05.435 --> 17:08.385
you did not face.

17:08.375 --> 17:12.125
And now you live in imaginary world,

17:12.135 --> 17:14.875
you have your own paradise about it.

17:14.871 --> 17:17.605
Where does He live within us?

17:17.601 --> 17:23.591
Has He created any position within us?

17:23.591 --> 17:26.391
Is there any meaning to His life,

17:26.398 --> 17:30.791
which has left a permanent mark within us

17:30.791 --> 17:33.291
Was He one of the
mile-stones within us?

17:33.291 --> 17:37.261
If so – where does He reside within us?

17:37.269 --> 17:39.219
How can we be connected to him?

17:39.210 --> 17:42.569
Nobody made any exploration about it.

17:42.582 --> 17:45.945
Again the comfortable shell started.

17:45.942 --> 17:47.845
It has happened not once,

17:47.832 --> 17:50.015
thousands of years it has been happening,

17:50.022 --> 17:52.265
whenever an Incarnation came on this Earth

17:52.262 --> 17:56.845
that’s how they behaved.

17:56.852 --> 18:00.182
When Rama came they said,
“We believe in Parashurama”,

18:00.188 --> 18:01.652
when Krishna came they said,

18:01.638 --> 18:03.932
"We believe in Rama."

18:03.918 --> 18:08.552
Same thing with Christ, with everyone.

18:08.548 --> 18:11.048
But you better now recognise

18:11.048 --> 18:15.638
and know yourself, and face it once for all,

18:15.639 --> 18:17.658
the time has come.

18:17.658 --> 18:20.639
How long are you going to live with your myths?

18:20.639 --> 18:24.108
The time has come.

18:24.102 --> 18:31.608
It has nothing to do with
East, West or North and South.

18:31.623 --> 18:34.123
Most amazing is that in the West,

18:34.123 --> 18:38.484
people are afraid that this is Eastern knowledge.

18:38.503 --> 18:41.204
The other day only one lady who is a Realised Soul,

18:41.194 --> 18:43.044
her son is a Realised Soul.

18:43.044 --> 18:45.544
They said their teacher was very anxious

18:45.544 --> 18:47.964
about my son, because he said, "Why are you

18:47.964 --> 18:50.464
giving this Eastern knowledge to him?"

18:50.464 --> 18:53.814
How can it be Eastern? It is universal knowledge

18:53.814 --> 18:56.314
I said, "Why don't you go and ask the teacher

18:56.314 --> 19:01.179
was Christ born in England or in America?

19:03.459 --> 19:05.959
His cross is even, you can find it

19:05.959 --> 19:13.923
on the airport of London.

19:15.897 --> 19:18.647
Because I think that Christ was an Englishman.

19:18.855 --> 19:20.517
So it’s all right, he has to – poor thing

19:20.510 --> 19:24.425
has to become an Englishman. What to do?

19:24.430 --> 19:27.645
This knowledge cannot be limited to Indians

19:27.615 --> 19:30.115
or to English or to anyone.

19:30.115 --> 19:34.184
It is God’s knowledge, it is for everyone of you

19:34.175 --> 19:39.155
it is your right to know.

19:39.165 --> 19:43.465
All of you have got Kundalini.

19:43.465 --> 19:45.965
You can see with your naked eyes its pulsation;

19:45.976 --> 19:48.476
you can see its rising.

19:48.453 --> 19:50.953
You can see its piercing through,

19:50.953 --> 19:52.685
you can feel it, it throbbing here.

19:52.685 --> 19:56.050
You can see the piercing.

19:56.074 --> 19:57.660
You can see, when it pierces through,

19:57.670 --> 20:00.980
how you become actually collectively conscious.

20:00.982 --> 20:05.780
You do become.

20:05.780 --> 20:10.842
It’s a fact! And how can you avoid fact?

20:10.833 --> 20:13.333
And why should you avoid?

20:13.333 --> 20:16.923
Because reality is so beautiful,

20:16.923 --> 20:19.223
why should we be afraid of facing the reality,

20:19.223 --> 20:21.723
which is so beautiful.

20:21.727 --> 20:25.233
There was a gentleman in Paris

20:25.233 --> 20:27.733
who got his Realisation and two days he was

20:27.733 --> 20:30.032
just laughing out of joy and he said,

20:30.032 --> 20:32.052
“I’ve never laughed all my life

20:32.052 --> 20:34.192
as I have laughed now” and just out of joy

20:34.192 --> 20:36.692
he was laughing;

20:36.692 --> 20:39.552
so joyous. He said, "Mother let me laugh now

20:39.552 --> 20:42.382
and enjoy myself, I'm really living."

20:42.382 --> 20:44.107
Actually he told me that he never believed

20:44.117 --> 20:46.137
in God, to begin with.

20:46.144 --> 20:49.132
He thought he was a very rational being.

20:49.152 --> 20:55.462
I said, rational beings are still half,

20:55.482 --> 20:57.504
because they are dealing with something

20:57.504 --> 21:01.299
so limited, is rationality.

21:05.704 --> 21:08.829
We have to cross these barriers of rationality,

21:08.854 --> 21:11.354
and something is already within you,

21:11.354 --> 21:13.854
God has placed within you because it is his

21:13.854 --> 21:17.198
desire that you should know Him,

21:17.198 --> 21:19.464
that His power should flow through you

21:19.468 --> 21:23.094
and that you should be the citizen of His kingdom,

21:23.094 --> 21:25.364
that He is your generous Father and He's

21:25.408 --> 21:30.929
and He has made all these arrangements for you.

21:30.928 --> 21:35.138
Now, 75% people sitting here are Realised Souls.

21:35.183 --> 21:42.608
I’m so very happy, because I struggled
with six of them for four years.

21:42.618 --> 21:47.878
It is such a remarkable thing

21:47.901 --> 21:51.538
but it is very, very hard for people to believe

21:51.550 --> 21:55.328
that you have to get an experience of God,

21:55.328 --> 21:59.247
you have to feel Him within yourself.

21:59.274 --> 22:06.197
As an actualisation, you have to
feel Him in your conscious mind.

22:06.217 --> 22:09.297
Because if religion gets organised

22:09.297 --> 22:13.170
you also get beliefs organised.

22:13.187 --> 22:16.837
Then, whatever they say becomes perfect;

22:16.850 --> 22:21.755
blind leading the blind.

22:23.570 --> 22:28.285
You cannot organise God, you cannot.

22:28.325 --> 22:31.835
He will organise.

22:31.855 --> 22:35.485
You cannot conceive Him.

22:35.505 --> 22:38.785
He has to conceive you.

22:38.785 --> 22:41.935
His Grace must come on you.

22:41.945 --> 22:46.255
You have to ask for his Grace.

22:46.275 --> 22:50.275
He has already placed His desire within you.

22:50.297 --> 22:55.265
And this desire resides as Kundalini.

22:55.263 --> 22:59.656
You have heard so much about
Kundalini before also, I believe.

22:59.656 --> 23:01.633
Maybe you must have read some horrible books,

23:01.643 --> 23:03.453
which are shown, to Me,

23:03.473 --> 23:05.623
that this Kundalini gives you jerks,

23:05.613 --> 23:08.113
and you start jumping and you start making

23:08.113 --> 23:11.428
noises and things like that.

23:11.413 --> 23:13.913
At the very outset, I must tell you

23:13.913 --> 23:17.883
that it is the desire of God, which is your Mother.

23:17.903 --> 23:23.687
And this Mother is your own Mother

23:23.720 --> 23:25.973
You do not have

23:25.980 --> 23:28.003
any other Mother but this Mother

23:28.003 --> 23:32.507
and She does not have any child but you.

23:32.508 --> 23:34.143
Do you think such a Mother

23:34.143 --> 23:37.263
who has been waiting to give you this rebirth

23:37.263 --> 23:41.273
would be in any way troublesome to you?

23:41.283 --> 23:46.943
Even your physical mother bore all the pains
upon herself to give you birth.

23:46.943 --> 23:52.786
Then why should this Mother try to trouble you?

23:52.786 --> 23:58.193
Then people asked Me, "Then how did
these people talk of these things?

23:58.193 --> 23:59.551
I mean you can talk of anything

23:59.526 --> 24:02.941
if you want to befool people.

24:02.956 --> 24:06.186
If you want to befool people, can’t you?

24:06.206 --> 24:09.396
I mean, if you indulge into such a thing you
can. You can get possessed by somebody

24:09.396 --> 24:14.165
also, that you start writing all these nonsensical things.

24:16.036 --> 24:17.656
So many mythical things have been written

24:17.614 --> 24:21.176
apart from that, those who write that Kundalini
gives you jerks and all that

24:21.206 --> 24:25.596
maybe the people, who were something like
villagers coming and touching the electricity

24:25.596 --> 24:32.156
at a wrong point and getting a shock and maligning
the electricity, maybe the unauthorised people,

24:32.165 --> 24:34.665
who did not know anything about Kundalini.

24:34.665 --> 24:40.225
For Kundalini can only be awakened by an authorised
person who is authorised by God.

24:40.236 --> 24:47.746
not by theological college or by any Pandit
or by any Ayurveda school or anything.

24:47.754 --> 24:51.186
Christ never went to any theological college.

24:56.274 --> 24:59.246
It cannot be done by any such person

24:59.246 --> 25:02.656
who says he will read books and raise the Kundalini.

25:02.676 --> 25:05.176
It’s not the mechanism that works out that way.

25:05.176 --> 25:08.596
You cannot even sprout a seed by reading.

25:08.582 --> 25:11.082
Can you?

25:11.082 --> 25:15.006
You have done nothing living by reading.

25:17.262 --> 25:22.327
How can you raise Kundalini by reading?

25:25.648 --> 25:32.734
This is in your every day-to-day life we really
lack sometimes common sense.

25:34.053 --> 25:40.753
We go and read something,

25:40.764 --> 25:47.193
we think by reading something we are going
to go to God,

25:47.193 --> 25:52.685
or we then sit down and discuss about it.

25:52.682 --> 25:56.522
You cannot do anything by this reading, which
is just a dead thing!

25:56.542 --> 26:00.762
All your arguments, everything is dead.

26:00.756 --> 26:04.906
It is not yet enlightened; otherwise every word
could be living.

26:04.926 --> 26:06.826
That’s the Mantra.

26:06.842 --> 26:11.176
The word that is living is the Mantra.

26:12.630 --> 26:16.460
These holy words,

26:16.480 --> 26:18.980
if spoken by a person who is not enlightened

26:18.980 --> 26:21.250
has no meaning at all.

26:21.260 --> 26:24.620
If it is spoken by a person, who is enlightened,

26:24.630 --> 26:27.850
because enlightenment
means he is related to God

26:27.830 --> 26:30.330
and he can address to God

26:30.330 --> 26:32.830
like you get connected.

26:36.840 --> 26:40.975
All right, if it is done, done, nothing to worry.

26:40.984 --> 26:43.484
Nothing to feel bad, if some people have been

26:43.484 --> 26:45.984
very fanatically involved into it,

26:45.985 --> 26:47.826
it doesn’t matter.

26:47.885 --> 26:51.236
Makes no difference at all today, I feel.

26:51.265 --> 26:53.456
All kinds of things, whatever are done are done

26:53.466 --> 26:55.536
in the past, finished.

26:55.536 --> 26:58.036
We have to get our Realisation.

26:58.036 --> 27:00.536
We have to actualise ourselves.

27:00.536 --> 27:01.921
This is the main point.

27:01.921 --> 27:03.791
We are seeking ourselves.

27:03.791 --> 27:05.691
Unless and until you realise yourself

27:05.691 --> 27:08.781
you don’t have to even believe in Me,

27:08.781 --> 27:11.281
but you should not deny Me.

27:12.645 --> 27:19.016
I would not like anybody to believe in Me, blindly,

27:19.016 --> 27:24.695
because blind people cannot get it.

27:24.696 --> 27:27.849
But you should not be also closed

27:27.856 --> 27:32.539
because closed people also cannot get it.

27:32.556 --> 27:36.318
When you get it then you must believe,

27:36.316 --> 27:38.475
that is what is called as 'Shraddha.'

27:38.466 --> 27:41.385
In Sanskrit language, there two things are;

27:41.396 --> 27:49.004
one is blind faith and another is Shraddha,

27:49.004 --> 27:53.244
that is faith, pure faith.

27:53.244 --> 27:57.324
But in English we have to use an adjective

27:57.364 --> 27:59.704
that blind faith and faith.

27:59.714 --> 28:02.056
But people are so confused that they forget

28:02.054 --> 28:03.626
the adjective of blind,

28:03.614 --> 28:06.256
and they think my faith is... If your faith is that

28:06.256 --> 28:11.730
one has to accept it.

28:11.746 --> 28:15.826
But your faith should be such that it is based

28:15.836 --> 28:22.114
on the truth.

28:22.116 --> 28:28.074
Then you become an enlightened person.

28:28.081 --> 28:30.937
After all God has made us into human beings,

28:30.941 --> 28:32.947
He has given us this nose, eyes, everything.

28:32.947 --> 28:35.447
We have done nothing about it.

28:35.447 --> 28:40.750
And if He has made us for a purpose, He is going
to connect us, He is going to do it.

28:40.741 --> 28:41.904
It’s His job

28:41.904 --> 28:46.034
If He does not do it, He will have no meaning,
His creation will have no meaning.

28:46.034 --> 28:49.374
It is His job!

28:52.873 --> 28:57.877
And besides that somebody else wants to do
it for you, why should you worry?

28:57.900 --> 29:00.400
Once you get it, you can do it, too.

29:00.400 --> 29:09.550
Like one light enlightened can
enlighten another light, you can do it.

29:09.565 --> 29:13.880
Today I wanted to talk a little bit,

29:13.910 --> 29:18.400
because 75 % are Sahaja Yogis, who are Realised
Souls and who know Sahaja Yoga, they have

29:18.411 --> 29:22.890
given Realisation to so many, they have cured
people and I mean they are just there.

29:23.670 --> 29:30.458
And I was very happy that in Paris so many
of them achieved their Nirvikalpa,

29:30.460 --> 29:34.910
which is... we call as the Doubtless Awareness.

29:34.910 --> 29:39.520
The first state is the Thoughtless Awareness.

29:39.529 --> 29:44.340
Awareness means, 'Enlightened
Awareness,' you can say,

29:44.380 --> 29:50.749
'Samadhi' is the one where your awareness
becomes enlightened.

29:50.751 --> 29:54.936
The first state is of Thoughtless Awareness.

29:54.951 --> 29:58.846
And then you jump into your Realisation,

29:58.856 --> 30:03.236
but still the state is not established.

30:03.251 --> 30:11.001
You mature then as Doubtless Awareness,

30:11.013 --> 30:17.003
and this Doubtless Awareness is a state, is not
a thing. “Now I have no doubts about Sahaja

30:17.013 --> 30:21.433
Yoga”, that’s not the way. It's a state,

30:21.443 --> 30:27.763
where the rhythm of these vibrations,
or the rhythm of these radiations

30:27.743 --> 30:32.329
achieve a certain depth and a rhythm,

30:32.326 --> 30:39.196
which then you yourself start seeing that these
doubts are something separate and you build

30:39.206 --> 30:46.526
up your own reserve against them. It's not
mental state, it is the state of the being.

30:46.547 --> 30:55.017
You can say a seed becoming a fruit

30:55.020 --> 30:57.520
and maturing,

30:57.520 --> 31:00.612
or you can say a flower becoming a fruit

31:00.606 --> 31:04.642
and then the fruit maturing.

31:04.645 --> 31:07.836
In this way, first you get your Self Realisation

31:07.836 --> 31:10.336
and you get your Thoughtless Awareness.

31:10.336 --> 31:13.516
And then you get your Doubtless Awareness.

31:13.504 --> 31:15.896
But people who are not complicated so much,

31:15.896 --> 31:19.106
uncomplicated people, simple people,

31:19.086 --> 31:22.046
PART OF SHRI MATAJI'S TALK IS MISSING

31:22.071 --> 31:24.537
chakras are alright,  or not you start verifying it

31:24.537 --> 31:26.317
through your brain.

31:26.327 --> 31:29.157
You go round and round and round.

31:29.185 --> 31:32.657
That's why the first thing you get is...

31:32.665 --> 31:38.150
your attention gets enlightened.

31:38.180 --> 31:42.690
You put your attention to someone and you
know about that person on your fingers.

31:42.700 --> 31:48.090
You can feel their centres and then you know
through decoding what centres.

31:48.102 --> 31:54.320
Supposing somebody is having a heart-attack
or something you can feel it on this finger,

31:54.339 --> 31:59.317
a heat, or a kind of a spasm,
sometimes and sometimes numbness.

31:59.327 --> 32:04.636
If a person is going to die, you feel a numbness
in all your fingers. There are many things

32:04.656 --> 32:09.144
which decode it. Apart from physical
you have got also emotional problems

32:09.124 --> 32:14.404
which can be found out. The left side suggest
the emotional problem and the right side

32:14.398 --> 32:16.898
the physical and the mental problem.

32:16.898 --> 32:19.491
If a person is egoistical,

32:19.496 --> 32:24.689
if his ego is hurt, anyway if there's a problem
with his ego somehow or other

32:24.701 --> 32:30.494
in any way, then you get this
finger catching very much.

32:30.504 --> 32:34.284
But after getting Realisation, you
don't feel bad if somebody says,

32:34.282 --> 32:36.782
“Mother, my Agnya here is catching.”

32:36.782 --> 32:39.054
All right, you say it, you don’t feel bad about it.

32:39.032 --> 32:41.039
You say, "All right, clear it out!"

32:41.035 --> 32:45.489
This centre is that of Christ.

32:45.485 --> 32:47.985
Even many people who call themselves Christians

32:47.985 --> 32:51.989
have the same Agnya as the Jews
have and as the Muslims have.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.929
One because they are unauthorised

32:55.925 --> 33:00.007
that’s why Christ is angry, another
because they are criticising Christ.

33:00.017 --> 33:04.637
Both ways it is just the same.

33:04.651 --> 33:10.067
Christ wants, or anyone of them, they want
that you should realise them, you should feel

33:10.042 --> 33:15.217
them, you should know them.

33:17.977 --> 33:24.277
Today specially for the Sahaja Yogis I
wanted to discuss the right side very much,

33:24.301 --> 33:31.691
because so far, we have not dealt with it very
much. Normally we got people who were

33:31.691 --> 33:34.671
on the left side, on the emotional problem.

33:34.683 --> 33:40.273
The right side is called also as Prana Shakti,

33:40.268 --> 33:44.658
means the vital power of life.

33:44.643 --> 33:48.598
And the left side is called as Mana Shakti.

33:48.604 --> 33:51.104
Now this Prana Shakti,

33:51.114 --> 33:56.335
which is on the right-hand side...

33:56.320 --> 33:58.820
What's happened?

34:00.969 --> 34:03.469
There's some noise somewhere.

34:05.334 --> 34:08.225
The Prana Shakti within us

34:08.241 --> 34:13.015
comes to us through five elements.

34:13.011 --> 34:20.245
The five elements are, as you know,

34:20.270 --> 34:24.935
is, one of them is the earth,

34:24.960 --> 34:26.955
then we have got the water,

34:26.970 --> 34:30.760
then we have got the air,

34:30.779 --> 34:33.279
then we have got the light

34:33.307 --> 34:35.807
and then we have got the ether.

34:35.807 --> 34:38.307
These five elements are there.

34:38.332 --> 34:43.849
Out of these five elements our body is made.

34:43.874 --> 34:54.189
These five elements create five cocoons around
us. And that’s how we have got five auras within us.

34:54.199 --> 35:00.489
These five auras can be
detected by some machines

35:00.493 --> 35:05.209
because these machines are

35:05.209 --> 35:14.579
able to detect only the right side

35:14.579 --> 35:18.579
as they deal with matter.

35:18.589 --> 35:27.464
The whole of the matter is created by these five
energies and they have also a casual energy behind

35:27.454 --> 35:32.351
it. And these casual energies actually make that.

35:32.370 --> 35:38.765
For example: the causal
energy of earth is fragrance.

35:38.758 --> 35:44.211
From the fragrance earth is created.

35:44.218 --> 35:46.718
Now, within us all these five centres

35:46.718 --> 35:53.652
that you see

35:53.664 --> 36:01.742
these are, these five up to
here, are made of five elements.

36:01.742 --> 36:04.985
The body of those centres are made of

36:04.985 --> 36:09.157
only the body part, I am saying
– of those five elements.

36:09.143 --> 36:18.547
And the Deities residing in those centres
are also born from those five elements.

36:18.547 --> 36:22.747
Because they were born of a particular element,

36:22.760 --> 36:35.512
they concentrated more on that and maintained
the knowledge more limited to that area,

36:35.527 --> 36:38.592
which dealt with that particular element.

36:38.586 --> 36:46.620
For example, we can say the green thing is the
one that represents the water, water element.

36:46.632 --> 36:53.130
This centre in the stomach is
the water element within us.

36:53.135 --> 36:56.175
It is called as Nabhi Chakra

36:56.185 --> 36:59.765
and around it is called as the
Bhavasaghara, you can say the Void

36:59.765 --> 37:02.055
or you can say the Gap, or whatever you may say,

37:02.055 --> 37:06.355
the whole world as such, within us.

37:06.377 --> 37:15.445
So the people who were born on
this centre, around this centre,

37:15.425 --> 37:21.791
were born out of water element.

37:21.791 --> 37:28.575
In this Bhavasaghra, Bhavasaghra
means the ocean of this world

37:28.585 --> 37:36.342
were born, through this ocean of the world,
were born all the Primordial Masters

37:36.353 --> 37:38.582
one after another,

37:38.583 --> 37:42.849
we can say Abraham, Moses,

37:42.849 --> 37:49.559
we had Janaka, we had Adi Nath and Socrates

37:49.573 --> 37:52.529
and so many others like that

37:52.523 --> 37:55.023
Nanaka

37:55.023 --> 37:59.532
and also very recently we
had about hundred years back

37:59.542 --> 38:03.769
a very great saint born in India known as Sainath.

38:03.769 --> 38:08.362
They all represent the same
element, that is the water element,

38:08.377 --> 38:10.877
being responsible or being born out of that

38:10.877 --> 38:25.038
they are anxious to maintain water element as the
one which is within us for sustaining ourselves.

38:25.028 --> 38:29.748
We are sustained by water so they
help us to sustain ourselves.

38:29.737 --> 38:34.901
They are the sustainers, they tell us
how to sustain, as a human being.

38:34.898 --> 38:42.683
And all of them have tried to establish religion
within us. A religion doesn’t mean outside,

38:42.664 --> 38:49.614
but the religion as a man, means the capacity
of a man or you can say, the quality of a man.

38:49.633 --> 38:52.133
What a human being should be like,

38:52.133 --> 38:55.907
what is the way to know if
he is a human being or not

38:55.897 --> 38:59.497
which is described in the Ten Commandments.

38:59.497 --> 39:05.787
Now the way they have said it is all
misinterpreted and all wrong things have come.

39:05.806 --> 39:11.666
But one thing is definite, that they have never talked of fanaticism.

39:11.661 --> 39:14.161
They are against fanaticism.

39:14.161 --> 39:22.094
They are against alcoholism, because
alcohol spoils the water element very much.

39:22.118 --> 39:28.558
If you see the effect of alcohol on
water in the blood of human beings

39:28.568 --> 39:30.708
you will be amazed how

39:30.704 --> 39:34.094
the neutral position of hydrogen
and oxygen are over time

39:34.094 --> 39:38.174
is absolutely imbalanced by alcohol.

39:38.174 --> 39:40.873
And water cannot absorb any heat from the liver,

39:40.873 --> 39:43.373
which sorts out all your poisons.

39:43.383 --> 39:47.049
And that's how people get bad livers and bad troubles

39:47.049 --> 39:51.628
and then people would say, "What's wrong?"

39:51.628 --> 39:55.119
There is nothing wrong as such,
because even nothing wrong in that.

39:55.119 --> 40:00.858
“What’s wrong according to the theory
of wrong and right of human beings,

40:00.868 --> 40:04.088
I think nothing is wrong. You can kill
yourself. You can jump from anything.

40:04.110 --> 40:07.781
You can do whatever you like.

40:07.781 --> 40:11.811
There is nothing wrong. If you break this, if you
break that, if you break anybody, do anything,

40:11.831 --> 40:16.751
there is nothing wrong what’s wrong with it?

40:16.766 --> 40:21.078
But there is fundamentally wrong is
that you are created for a purpose.

40:21.049 --> 40:23.408
You have not created yourself.

40:23.422 --> 40:26.758
God has created you with such difficulties.

40:26.782 --> 40:30.968
He has taken you out of

40:30.961 --> 40:34.558
so many evolutionary processes
and brought you to this stage

40:34.546 --> 40:40.378
and now you have no business to
kill yourself and destroy yourself.

40:40.379 --> 40:43.988
This is wrong is that you are destroying
yourself, you are destroying your community

40:43.998 --> 40:48.248
you are destroying others or
you are destroying yourself.

40:48.258 --> 40:53.988
If you are destroying yourself also because
you are on your own, you think, "What’s wrong?"

40:53.988 --> 40:57.298
You are a part and parcel of the whole.

40:57.288 --> 41:03.068
You are a cell in the whole and
being created to know the whole

41:03.058 --> 41:06.348
and if you destroy yourself you
are destroying the whole as well.

41:06.358 --> 41:12.381
You become malignant. You become cancerous

41:12.358 --> 41:14.858
and that’s why it’s all wrong.

41:14.858 --> 41:21.167
In anyway if you destroy others or destroy
yourself you have no right to do that.

41:21.134 --> 41:24.007
God has given you freedom, no doubt.

41:24.014 --> 41:28.777
By creating ego and superego within
yourself with these activities,

41:28.777 --> 41:31.047
you become separated from the whole.

41:31.042 --> 41:34.192
And then you think you are Mr Such and Such.

41:34.192 --> 41:39.532
And then you stand and say, “I
believe in this, and I believe in...,"

41:39.548 --> 41:43.958
actually who are you? You are made by God.

41:43.968 --> 41:46.468
You are His own child.

41:46.492 --> 41:48.771
Still you are a child.

41:48.778 --> 41:53.541
It's like a baby saying, "I believe in it, I believe in it."

41:55.525 --> 41:57.889
You have not known the whole so far.

41:57.891 --> 42:01.139
How can you say that?

42:01.151 --> 42:04.649
You have to grow!

42:04.661 --> 42:08.016
And when you grow, your
freedom is complete,

42:08.018 --> 42:10.518
absolute.

42:10.518 --> 42:17.946
But the ideas about this freedom are such
that you are fighting your own innocence

42:17.956 --> 42:21.786
you are fighting your own sustenance.

42:21.796 --> 42:30.072
And this sustenance was completely supported

42:30.092 --> 42:38.382
protected by these great
incarnations of Primordial Masters.

42:38.373 --> 42:42.216
That’s why they talked against alcohol.

42:42.231 --> 42:47.851
Christ did not talk about alcohol, all
right – because He was at another point,

42:47.851 --> 42:51.571
but He did not say that you take alcohol, never.

42:51.591 --> 42:53.471
People said that He drank wine

42:53.471 --> 42:56.881
but wine means grape juice in that country,

42:56.881 --> 42:59.381
it doesn’t mean alcohol.

43:02.411 --> 43:05.821
How can Christ say, you drink wine,

43:05.835 --> 43:07.981
which is fermented,

43:07.984 --> 43:09.931
which will go against your awareness?

43:09.931 --> 43:12.164
Just think of it!

43:12.191 --> 43:15.264
It goes against your awareness, isn’t it?

43:15.261 --> 43:17.464
Your awareness is to be enlightened,

43:17.487 --> 43:19.987
He came on this earth to enlighten that awareness,

43:19.987 --> 43:25.020
do you think He will say that you get foggy with it?

43:24.997 --> 43:29.510
Does it not fog your attention and your awareness,

43:29.510 --> 43:32.010
is a fact.

43:32.010 --> 43:37.750
But He wants to do something else

43:37.740 --> 43:43.686
because He came as Divine Power itself.

43:43.767 --> 43:46.267
He was the embodiment of Pranava

43:46.267 --> 43:51.777
not Prana – all powers put together.

43:51.775 --> 43:57.267
He was the embodiment of OM itself, the Brahma.

43:57.279 --> 44:00.527
That’s why He came to prove

44:00.537 --> 44:02.999
what Krishna has said,

44:02.999 --> 44:06.239
that it cannot be killed by anyone.

44:06.252 --> 44:08.659
It cannot be blown off,

44:08.662 --> 44:11.979
it cannot be destroyed.

44:11.972 --> 44:15.232
His body was made out of that,

44:15.252 --> 44:20.732
and that’s why He could be resurrected.

44:25.082 --> 44:26.691
All these things are knowledgeable

44:26.691 --> 44:28.262
only if you are a realised soul,

44:28.262 --> 44:31.882
otherwise you cannot understand this.

44:31.882 --> 44:35.192
Because you have not yet gone into the depth

44:35.222 --> 44:36.882
of your own understanding,

44:36.902 --> 44:40.192
you are still children as I say,

44:40.182 --> 44:43.148
you have to be born again,

44:43.162 --> 44:50.578
and then you can find out for these vibrations.

44:50.561 --> 44:54.448
You have to ask just a question,

44:54.448 --> 45:03.298
“Was Christ embodied with Pranava,

45:03.287 --> 45:06.323
or the OM, or the Brahma?

45:06.318 --> 45:10.902
Or was He made of Brahma itself?”

45:10.902 --> 45:15.512
You will get the cool breeze.

45:15.512 --> 45:20.842
and that is the sign that He was.

45:20.844 --> 45:28.154
It is much deeper but the whole
knowledge exists as experience to you.

45:28.154 --> 45:32.932
The whole of it, it is an experience within us.

45:32.924 --> 45:36.784
And one has to get that experience of oneself,

45:36.809 --> 45:39.542
which is knowledge itself

45:39.559 --> 45:43.778
and then everything trickles down

45:43.774 --> 45:48.925
just like actual thing within us,
as we see white as white and red as red.

45:48.925 --> 45:55.255
Animals do not see perhaps,
but human beings do see.

45:55.275 --> 46:02.755
Thus, our awareness is enlightened.

46:02.765 --> 46:08.635
I will be talking to other Sahaja Yogis in
the Ashram about the right side later on

46:08.658 --> 46:12.695
because we have new people, and
they are to be looked after.

46:12.733 --> 46:21.029
And I think, next time when I
meet, I don’t know when, maybe...

46:21.024 --> 46:27.804
No, in the Ashram firstly. Thursday evening I think, then
I'll talk to you because Friday I've got to fly out.

46:27.796 --> 46:30.995
Thursday evening I will
be there most probably.

46:33.824 --> 46:38.634
So just now, let’s have the
experience for the new ones,

46:38.639 --> 46:43.814
and for the others also to deepen themselves.
May God bless you.

46:46.799 --> 46:50.469
All of you should put your
hands just like this, before Me,

46:50.480 --> 46:56.409
and close your eyes, just close your eyes!

46:56.409 --> 47:01.698
Put the hands like this, you
see and just close your eyes.

47:01.712 --> 47:06.089
You have to close your eyes because
the Kundalini, when She rises

47:06.052 --> 47:08.629
on the Agnya Chakra

47:08.633 --> 47:10.789
the dilatation of the pupil takes place

47:10.793 --> 47:14.496
and if your eyes are open the dilatation doesn’t take place.

47:14.449 --> 47:20.689
When people mesmerize they keep your eyes
open, because they put you on the sides.

47:20.699 --> 47:26.259
I will tell one day how they mesmerise, also.

47:28.923 --> 47:34.030
First you will feel that there is no thought
in your mind, if you watch your thoughts.

47:34.010 --> 47:41.250
Then the Kundalini rises about
Agnya, you get Thoughtless Awareness.

47:42.563 --> 47:49.400
When it pierces the fontenel bone area, I mean
when you get your baptism by your Kundalini,

47:49.399 --> 47:57.717
then you feel the kind of a cool
breeze coming towards you from me;

47:57.726 --> 48:07.796
or a kind of a radiation of cool breeze
coming. From all over you might feel it.

48:13.107 --> 48:19.168
On your hands! Through
your fingers! It works!

48:22.798 --> 48:25.308
All of you should put your
hands towards me. Please!

48:26.848 --> 48:29.348
That's important.

48:34.303 --> 48:41.989
I mean even to put your hands is hard to
request, that means how egotistical you are.

48:41.994 --> 48:48.732
You've come here for getting your Realisation
and don't even want to put your hands towards me.

48:48.753 --> 48:54.188
All such people should leave.

48:54.208 --> 48:58.413
Getting cool breeze?
Great!

48:58.413 --> 49:00.511
Close you eyes and enjoy yourself.

49:00.513 --> 49:05.301
Best is to enjoy, this is the greatest
moment you've been waiting for.

49:05.309 --> 49:10.059
Close you eyes!
Enjoy yourself!
