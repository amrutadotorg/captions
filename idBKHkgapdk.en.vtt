﻿Public Program. Brasilia, Brazil, 1992-1015

00:01:28.668 --> 00:01:33.770
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:01:40.413 --> 00:01:45.437
We have to know that truth is what it is.

00:01:46.227 --> 00:01:51.165
We cannot change it, we cannot transform it,

00:01:52.168 --> 00:01:55.385
we cannot read about it.

00:01:57.277 --> 00:02:03.621
Also, unfortunately at this human awareness, we cannot know it.

00:02:06.468 --> 00:02:11.291
We have to become the Spirit.

00:02:13.974 --> 00:02:17.141
Whatever I am going to tell you today,

00:02:17.342 --> 00:02:21.600
you need not believe me blindfolded.

00:02:24.605 --> 00:02:29.830
But keep your mind open as a scientist has.

00:02:30.364 --> 00:02:34.660
Treat is as a hypothesis.

00:02:35.356 --> 00:02:40.352
And if it turns to be the truth,

00:02:40.553 --> 00:02:45.326
you have to accept it as honest people.

00:02:45.717 --> 00:02:52.744
Because it is for the benevolence

00:02:52.945 --> 00:02:55.079
of your own, benevolence of your country

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.358
and benevolence of the whole world.

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:05.626
We are born in a very special time today.

00:03:06.476 --> 00:03:11.468
These are the times when lots of things are going to happen.

00:03:12.384 --> 00:03:17.020
And people will be in illusions,

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.869
won't understand what is right and what is wrong.

00:03:22.185 --> 00:03:29.208
But at this time only, there are many who are seeking the truth.

00:03:30.134 --> 00:03:34.204
They are not sticking on to any one book

00:03:34.405 --> 00:03:37.228
or sticking on to one ideology.

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:42.420
But they want to know what is beyond.

00:03:42.621 --> 00:03:47.262
They are a special category of people.

00:03:48.445 --> 00:03:52.558
William Blake, a great poet, has said that

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:57.486
"Men of God will be born in those days.

00:03:58.248 --> 00:04:01.579
And they will find their divinity

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.276
and they will make others divine."

00:04:07.281 --> 00:04:15.180
Believe Me, you all have your divinity intact within yourself.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:20.535
It cannot be tarnished,

00:04:20.736 --> 00:04:26.290
it cannot be destroyed whatever you might have done to yourself.

00:04:26.735 --> 00:04:31.125
Because it is eternal in nature.

00:04:31.718 --> 00:04:37.491
Only question is of manifesting this divinity

00:04:38.866 --> 00:04:45.507
through your ascent into a new realm of reality.

00:04:46.595 --> 00:04:50.720
You are all ready for it.

00:04:51.478 --> 00:04:56.759
There is no more fasting or suffering needed.

00:04:57.627 --> 00:05:03.267
There is no need to change you dress and you foods.

00:05:03.737 --> 00:05:09.346
It is the internal happening that is important.

00:05:11.152 --> 00:05:16.272
You have been already told about

00:05:16.472 --> 00:05:21.183
the subtle system that works it out.

00:05:23.008 --> 00:05:28.987
When this power called Kundalini, which resides in the sacrum bone,

00:05:29.188 --> 00:05:34.587
awakens, She passes through six centers.

00:05:36.556 --> 00:05:39.603
The Greeks perhaps knew it was a sacrum bone,

00:05:39.811 --> 00:05:44.022
so they call it a sacrum.

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:51.605
And this is awaken just like a seed is sprouted,

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.633
because the seed has the built in quality to sprout.

00:05:59.272 --> 00:06:03.967
All living process is spontaneous.

00:06:06.486 --> 00:06:10.192
So there are two things we should know

00:06:10.393 --> 00:06:14.471
when we are seeking the truth.

00:06:18.734 --> 00:06:25.166
The first one is that you are not this body, this mind,

00:06:25.367 --> 00:06:29.097
this ego, this conditioning,

00:06:29.298 --> 00:06:33.595
but you are the pure Spirit.

00:06:34.551 --> 00:06:40.249
The second truth is that there is an All Pervading Divine Power

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:45.083
which does all the living work.

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:50.873
You see these beautiful plants, it is a miracle.

00:06:51.255 --> 00:06:55.310
But we take it for granted.

00:06:56.045 --> 00:07:00.830
We have these eyes which are, which is a camera.

00:07:01.031 --> 00:07:05.882
It is a miracle, but we take it for granted.

00:07:06.895 --> 00:07:13.414
Then look at our brain, which is such a great computer,

00:07:13.615 --> 00:07:17.646
but we take it for granted.

00:07:18.528 --> 00:07:22.872
If you ask a doctor who runs your heart,

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:27.771
he will say it is the autonomous nervous system.

00:07:28.226 --> 00:07:31.843
Now, who is this auto?

00:07:33.352 --> 00:07:40.868
So there is some power which is working out all these living miracles.

00:07:41.585 --> 00:07:45.479
So the first truth is that you are the pure Spirit

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:54.336
and the second one is that there is this All Pervading Power of Divine Love.

00:07:55.582 --> 00:08:01.214
We cannot feel it, we cannot see it, but it exists.

00:08:05.884 --> 00:08:10.653
Now when this Power rises through these centers,

00:08:10.854 --> 00:08:14.940
It nourishes those centers.

00:08:15.522 --> 00:08:25.663
All human problems are because of these centers.

00:08:26.616 --> 00:08:30.197
And if these centers are put right,

00:08:30.398 --> 00:08:35.914
all your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual problems

00:08:36.115 --> 00:08:40.443
can be solved.

00:08:40.682 --> 00:08:44.783
It is as simple as that.

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:52.521
Also I would like to tell you in short

00:08:52.722 --> 00:08:57.316
what happens to your awareness.

00:08:58.287 --> 00:09:03.618
When this Kundalini connects you to the mains

00:09:03.819 --> 00:09:06.826
as this instrument when connected to the mains

00:09:07.027 --> 00:09:10.771
has some meaning,

00:09:11.371 --> 00:09:15.668
so you too have some meaning.

00:09:17.888 --> 00:09:25.075
But it makes you stand in the present.

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:31.517
We are all the time jumping on the cusp of the thoughts

00:09:31.718 --> 00:09:36.866
which are coming from the past or from the present.

00:09:37.466 --> 00:09:42.086
But then when the Kundalini rises, She separates those thoughts

00:09:42.287 --> 00:09:46.451
and the space in between is the present.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:50.003
So you develop a new awareness

00:09:50.204 --> 00:09:54.221
called as thoughtless awareness.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.980
You are aware, fully aware,

00:09:57.181 --> 00:10:02.298
but there is no thought in your mind to disturb you.

00:10:03.585 --> 00:10:08.773
Thus you achieve peace within yourself.

00:10:11.242 --> 00:10:15.647
There a many people who have got prices for peace,

00:10:15.848 --> 00:10:20.199
but I am not seeing that peace within themselves.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:27.718
So this peace within us is existing there, we become that peace.

00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:30.774
And such a person emits peace

00:10:30.975 --> 00:10:35.530
and neutralizes violence and anger.

00:10:38.131 --> 00:10:45.123
Now the nature of the Spirit is that Spirit is the universal being.

00:10:47.159 --> 00:10:51.527
We are also universal.

00:10:52.104 --> 00:10:55.928
If you cut a part of your body,

00:10:56.129 --> 00:11:00.726
you'll find every one has the same bone,

00:11:00.927 --> 00:11:05.637
the same muscle, the same artery.

00:11:06.609 --> 00:11:12.734
So we are all inside universal.

00:11:13.591 --> 00:11:18.294
We laugh the same way, we smile the same.

00:11:18.891 --> 00:11:22.859
The difference is just skin deep.

00:11:23.533 --> 00:11:28.429
That is also just to create variety,

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:32.872
otherwise it would have been boring.

00:11:33.371 --> 00:11:37.059
But this universal like nature within us

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:43.541
is manifested when the light of the Spirit comes into our consciousness.

00:11:44.064 --> 00:11:50.832
We transcend all the barriers of races, cast, community,

00:11:51.033 --> 00:11:55.166
religion and nations.

00:11:55.628 --> 00:12:00.284
In short, you become part and parcel of the whole.

00:12:01.943 --> 00:12:07.295
Like the microcosm become the macrocosm.

00:12:08.229 --> 00:12:11.980
But it is a becoming, it is not just a lecture

00:12:12.181 --> 00:12:14.481
or telling something or a false certificate,

00:12:14.682 --> 00:12:18.822
but is the becoming that is important.

00:12:20.478 --> 00:12:25.132
And you develop a balance in your life.

00:12:26.423 --> 00:12:30.532
Moreover you become innately righteous.

00:12:31.095 --> 00:12:35.308
For example, you're maybe a Hindu, Christian, Muslim, anything.

00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:39.805
You can commit any sin.

00:12:40.825 --> 00:12:43.899
But once you become the Spirit,

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:49.483
you become above everything that is wrong.

00:12:51.024 --> 00:12:59.932
You get your sense of security and your power.

00:13:01.528 --> 00:13:06.395
Sense of security and your power of love.

00:13:07.116 --> 00:13:10.991
This power is flowing in you then.

00:13:12.706 --> 00:13:17.210
With that power, you become extremely compassionate

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:21.442
and extremely dynamic.

00:13:22.308 --> 00:13:26.811
But when the light of the Spirit comes into you attention,

00:13:27.012 --> 00:13:31.223
your attention becomes enlightened

00:13:31.732 --> 00:13:36.122
Whenever you put your attention, it acts.

00:13:39.857 --> 00:13:44.477
the another great thing about the Spirit is that

00:13:44.678 --> 00:13:49.358
It is the source of absolute knowledge.

00:13:50.731 --> 00:13:54.617
Like you have ten children together, tie their eyes

00:13:54.818 --> 00:13:59.458
of our masterask them about somebody: "What is wrong with this person?"

00:14:00.342 --> 00:14:04.464
Now, all your centers are in your hand reflected,

00:14:04.665 --> 00:14:10.139
sympathetic, five, six, seven centers.

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:15.100
They all will raise one finger like this.

00:14:15.618 --> 00:14:20.571
Ask the gentleman: "Have you got heart trouble?"

00:14:21.369 --> 00:14:24.837
He will say: "Hoe do you know?"

00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:29.547
Because everyone will know the same thing.

00:14:30.109 --> 00:14:33.034
As you all can see Me sitting here, that is all.

00:14:33.234 --> 00:14:37.367
You see the same thing.

00:14:37.742 --> 00:14:42.699
So then there are no dogmas, no theories, nothing of the kind,

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:46.962
but actually you see the reality.

00:14:47.621 --> 00:14:51.668
Then who is going to quarrel?

00:14:52.722 --> 00:14:56.730
How can there is difference of opinion,

00:14:58.058 --> 00:15:02.183
There cannot be wars then at all.

00:15:05.246 --> 00:15:12.270
But the Spirit is the ocean of joy.

00:15:13.166 --> 00:15:17.935
And after you get your Self Realization,

00:15:18.136 --> 00:15:22.652
you feel as if you are swimming in the ocean of joy.

00:15:22.853 --> 00:15:28.454
You get separated from your problems and you see them as a witness.

00:15:29.452 --> 00:15:33.499
And then you can solve them much better.

00:15:34.008 --> 00:15:39.289
Without getting involved into it or upset about it.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:48.479
I am so very happy to be in Brazil, specially in Brasilia.

00:15:49.233 --> 00:15:53.952
No doubt, this is a very spiritual place.

00:15:54.153 --> 00:15:58.523
There are great seekers and one day this may become

00:15:58.724 --> 00:16:03.646
the greatest spiritual nucleus for the whole world.

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:11.197
You can get your Realization in hardly ten minutes time.

00:16:12.565 --> 00:16:17.479
In this short time, I cannot tell you all about it.

00:16:18.153 --> 00:16:20.906
In this hall, say, there are so many lights

00:16:21.107 --> 00:16:26.599
and only you put on the switch and you get the lights there.

00:16:27.067 --> 00:16:31.192
Because it is all built in.

00:16:32.427 --> 00:16:36.231
No use telling you about the history of electricity,

00:16:36.432 --> 00:16:41.888
how it was brought to Brasilia, it is all boring.

00:16:42.478 --> 00:16:47.338
So the best thing is to get your Realization.

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:51.830
I know you have some questions in your mind.

00:16:52.282 --> 00:16:56.439
And I would love to answer them.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:02.054
After your Self Realization, you may change your mind.

00:17:02.799 --> 00:17:06.892
So why not get your Self Realization?

00:17:08.103 --> 00:17:12.541
You can't pay for it.

00:17:13.415 --> 00:17:18.532
It is a living process of your evolution.

00:17:19.166 --> 00:17:24.455
Without this happening, you can never be satisfied with yourself.

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:32.312
Anybody who ask money in the name of God is a hypocrite.

00:17:33.245 --> 00:17:38.370
Because God doesn't understand money and banking.

00:17:39.037 --> 00:17:43.372
It is the headache of human beings.

00:17:45.808 --> 00:17:53.261
So now, I would say that you all can get your Self Realization.

00:17:54.506 --> 00:17:59.741
But I cannot force on you because I respect your freedom.

00:18:00.889 --> 00:18:04.983
Those who want to have can get it

00:18:05.184 --> 00:18:10.981
and those who don't want to have, it cannot be.

00:18:11.508 --> 00:18:18.219
Christ has said that "The meek will inherit the Earth."

00:18:19.621 --> 00:18:24.637
So Sahaja Yoga is not meant for arrogant people

00:18:25.374 --> 00:18:30.296
nor it is meant for people who are stupid.

00:18:31.696 --> 00:18:38.008
It is meant for people who are truly seeking the truth.

00:18:39.347 --> 00:18:45.749
So I will request people who do not want to have their Realization

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:49.981
should leave the hall.

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:56.394
It will be very kind. And also very civil on their part

00:18:56.595 --> 00:19:00.915
not to stay here and watch others.

00:19:02.299 --> 00:19:07.544
If you are sticking on to some sort of a ideology,

00:19:07.745 --> 00:19:11.885
then also is difficult.

00:19:12.935 --> 00:19:17.045
You must keep your mind open,

00:19:18.984 --> 00:19:22.449
then it works.

00:19:23.508 --> 00:19:27.594
So I said it won't take much time.

00:19:28.969 --> 00:19:31.043
And leave about half a minute

00:19:31.244 --> 00:19:35.720
for you to leave with those who wants to leave.

00:19:48.842 --> 00:19:54.700
Alright. Such a wonderful thing that no one wants to leave.

00:19:55.221 --> 00:19:57.384
Alright.

00:19:57.673 --> 00:20:02.204
So there are three conditions which are very simple.

00:20:03.107 --> 00:20:06.172
The first condition is

00:20:06.373 --> 00:20:14.720
that you all have to be absolutely self-confident

00:20:14.921 --> 00:20:20.718
that you all will get your Self Realization tonight.

00:20:23.808 --> 00:20:28.395
So the second one is follows that

00:20:28.596 --> 00:20:32.878
you are not to condemn yourself for anything,

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:37.666
You have to forget the past.

00:20:38.697 --> 00:20:42.713
And don't feel guilty at all.

00:20:43.512 --> 00:20:45.735
If you have done committed some mistakes,

00:20:45.936 --> 00:20:50.365
after all you are human begins, you are not gods.

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:57.301
And this All Pervading Power is a ocean of forgiveness.

00:20:58.471 --> 00:21:04.205
So all your mistakes can be easily neutralized by that.

00:21:08.102 --> 00:21:12.219
So please don't feel guilty.

00:21:12.747 --> 00:21:18.641
If you feel guilty, it works against the center on the left-handed side,

00:21:18.842 --> 00:21:22.647
this center on the left-handed side.

00:21:23.355 --> 00:21:29.233
And you can get diseases like angina, like spondylitis,

00:21:29.433 --> 00:21:33.847
could be lethargic organs.

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:39.524
And at this time, if the centers are blocked,

00:21:39.725 --> 00:21:43.858
how will the Kundalini rises?

00:21:45.171 --> 00:21:47.171
So as they say in English language is the

00:21:47.372 --> 00:21:51.220
pain in the neck, you see that.

00:21:51.421 --> 00:21:54.632
...pain in the neck

00:21:55.174 --> 00:21:59.307
So let's get rid of that pain in the neck.

00:22:03.891 --> 00:22:06.582
In short, you should be very pleasantly placed

00:22:06.783 --> 00:22:10.610
towards yourself.

00:22:11.638 --> 00:22:18.036
Because you are glorious, you are magnificent.

00:22:19.095 --> 00:22:22.794
You are fantastic.

00:22:22.995 --> 00:22:27.291
Because you are not connected, you don't know what you are.

00:22:28.474 --> 00:22:33.172
Like a, supposing in an Indian village I take a television

00:22:33.373 --> 00:22:37.454
and tell them that you can see lots of films,

00:22:37.655 --> 00:22:42.960
then he will say: "Oh, what is this box? How can you see films in this?"

00:22:44.447 --> 00:22:46.989
But once you get it connected,

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:51.378
you can see what fantastic thing it is.

00:22:52.378 --> 00:22:57.721
We also think about ourselves that we are just a box.

00:22:58.122 --> 00:23:02.591
But you do not know how many powers there are within you.

00:23:04.203 --> 00:23:06.191
So you should be very pleasantly placed

00:23:06.392 --> 00:23:10.000
towards yourself.

00:23:10.473 --> 00:23:14.543
Because now you have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:23:15.235 --> 00:23:19.019
That Kingdom of God is the most efficient,

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:26.143
is the most loving organization.

00:23:28.343 --> 00:23:36.944
The third condition is even simpler that you have to forgive everyone.

00:23:38.685 --> 00:23:43.395
Many people say is very difficult to forgive.

00:23:44.326 --> 00:23:46.326
Logically, if you see,

00:23:46.527 --> 00:23:50.858
whether you forgive or you don't forgive, what do you do?

00:23:51.626 --> 00:23:54.480
You don't do anything.

00:23:54.681 --> 00:23:59.556
But when you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

00:24:00.292 --> 00:24:04.483
Those who have troubled you and have tortured you are happy,

00:24:04.684 --> 00:24:09.418
and you are torturing yourself on their behalf.

00:24:11.024 --> 00:24:18.806
But also the center of optical chiasma is like that in the Agnya Chakra.

00:24:19.542 --> 00:24:24.998
And this will never open unless and until you forgive.

00:24:26.133 --> 00:24:32.086
So you have to forgive, otherwise this won't open like this.

00:24:32.849 --> 00:24:36.329
As it is you are torturing yourself

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:41.401
all your life and now at this very important moment,

00:24:41.602 --> 00:24:45.758
you will miss your Self Realization.

00:24:46.466 --> 00:24:51.784
So just to forgive all of them, even don't think about them.

00:24:52.497 --> 00:24:56.942
Even thinking about them is a headache.

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:02.638
So in your heart, you should forgive all of them in general.

00:25:05.023 --> 00:25:09.067
These are the only three conditions.

00:25:09.268 --> 00:25:12.512
First is that you should be fully self-confident

00:25:12.713 --> 00:25:16.760
that you all will get your Realization.

00:25:17.785 --> 00:25:24.441
The second one is that you are not guilty at all.

00:25:25.283 --> 00:25:32.564
And the third one is we have to forgive everyone in general.

00:25:33.495 --> 00:25:40.011
Now we have to take out our shoes because this Mother Earth helps us a lot.

00:25:54.645 --> 00:25:59.785
Please sit inside otherwise, you have all to sit down.

00:25:59.986 --> 00:26:04.035
Don't be standing, please.

00:26:10.266 --> 00:26:14.274
There is some room here, behind.

00:26:39.256 --> 00:26:43.667
Now those who are sitting on the chairs, not on the ground,

00:26:43.868 --> 00:26:46.762
have to put both their feet on both the sides

00:26:46.963 --> 00:26:51.830
because left and right are two different powers.

00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:57.182
The left side power is the power of desire,

00:26:57.859 --> 00:27:02.523
And the right side one is the power of action.

00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:05.976
So now we put our left hand

00:27:06.177 --> 00:27:11.015
on our lap very comfortably.

00:27:12.461 --> 00:27:16.828
Someone has to come and show here.

00:27:17.696 --> 00:27:23.680
And the right hand we use for nourishing our centers.

00:27:25.544 --> 00:27:29.596
The left hand suggests that you are desirous

00:27:29.797 --> 00:27:35.160
of Self Realization, you have a strong desire to have Self Realization.

00:27:36.009 --> 00:27:39.410
And the right one is for the action.

00:27:39.611 --> 00:27:44.236
So first we put our right hand on our heart.

00:27:44.784 --> 00:27:49.112
In the heart resides the Spirit.

00:27:57.214 --> 00:28:01.772
So now if you become the Spirit, you become

00:28:01.973 --> 00:28:07.231
in the light of the Spirit, your own guide, your own master.

00:28:09.487 --> 00:28:14.436
So we take our hand in the upper portion of abdomen

00:28:14.637 --> 00:28:18.207
on left hand side,

00:28:19.323 --> 00:28:23.745
which is the center of our mastery.

00:28:26.238 --> 00:28:31.054
Then we take our right hand in the lower portion of abdomen

00:28:31.255 --> 00:28:34.958
on left hand side,

00:28:35.406 --> 00:28:43.515
which is the center of pure knowledge of Divine Laws.

00:28:45.513 --> 00:28:51.614
Then we raise again our right hand in the upper portion of abdomen.

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:55.977
Then on our heart.

00:28:56.604 --> 00:29:00.139
Then in the corner of our neck and our shoulder

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:03.973
and turn our head to right.

00:29:05.102 --> 00:29:09.363
I've already told you about this center that when you feel guilty,

00:29:09.564 --> 00:29:13.369
it goes out of order.

00:29:14.635 --> 00:29:20.513
Now we take our right hand and put it across our forehead

00:29:20.714 --> 00:29:24.558
and put down our head.

00:29:25.704 --> 00:29:33.555
This is the center to forgive everyone in general.

00:29:34.985 --> 00:29:40.512
Now we take back our right hand on the back side of our head

00:29:40.713 --> 00:29:45.408
and push back our head as far as possible.

00:29:46.112 --> 00:29:51.131
This is the center where without feeling guilty,

00:29:51.332 --> 00:29:55.335
without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction,

00:29:55.536 --> 00:30:00.411
you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine Power.

00:30:01.423 --> 00:30:03.821
Now the last center, you have to

00:30:04.022 --> 00:30:08.671
stretch your palm fully.

00:30:09.576 --> 00:30:14.615
And put the center of your palm on top of fontanel bone area

00:30:14.816 --> 00:30:19.545
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

00:30:20.517 --> 00:30:24.048
Now please bend your head.

00:30:24.594 --> 00:30:27.591
Very important is to push back your fingers,

00:30:27.792 --> 00:30:31.760
so that there is a good pression on your scalp.

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:41.664
Please now move your scalp clockwise seven times slowly.

00:30:45.529 --> 00:30:49.451
Please put down your hands.

00:30:51.371 --> 00:30:53.678
That is all we have to do now.

00:30:53.879 --> 00:30:56.101
We have to now close our eyes

00:30:56.302 --> 00:31:00.849
and please don't open them till I tell you.

00:31:01.356 --> 00:31:05.659
You can take out your glasses.

00:31:10.106 --> 00:31:14.157
Now, again, please put both feet apart from each other,

00:31:14.357 --> 00:31:19.107
put left hand like this and the right hand on the heart.

00:31:26.002 --> 00:31:30.229
And now please close your eyes.

00:31:32.932 --> 00:31:36.786
Here resides the Spirit,

00:31:36.986 --> 00:31:41.874
so you have to ask Me a very fundamental question about yourself.

00:31:42.074 --> 00:31:47.020
You may call Me Mother or you may call Me Shri Mataji.

00:31:57.253 --> 00:32:03.417
Please ask Me three time in your heart: "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

00:32:15.751 --> 00:32:20.223
I already told you that if you are the Spirit,

00:32:20.423 --> 00:32:24.587
you become your own master.

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:33.012
So now, please take your right hand

00:32:33.212 --> 00:32:37.360
in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:46.908
You are working only on the left hand side.

00:32:48.806 --> 00:32:57.427
Here again you have to ask a fundamental question three times:

00:32:57.627 --> 00:33:02.111
"Mother, am I my own master?"

00:33:10.552 --> 00:33:16.951
Now, I have already told you that I respect your freedom

00:33:17.151 --> 00:33:24.443
and I cannot force the pure knowledge of Divine on you,

00:33:24.643 --> 00:33:28.382
you have to ask for it.

00:33:36.521 --> 00:33:38.548
So now you have to take your right hand

00:33:38.748 --> 00:33:41.148
in the lower portion of your abdomen

00:33:41.349 --> 00:33:45.533
on the left hand side and press it and here

00:33:45.733 --> 00:33:48.174
you have to ask six times,

00:33:48.374 --> 00:33:52.768
because this center has got six petals.

00:33:52.968 --> 00:34:01.233
Please say six time: "Mother, please give me pure knowledge."

00:34:25.597 --> 00:34:31.272
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge,

00:34:31.472 --> 00:34:34.681
your Kundalini starts rising.

00:34:34.881 --> 00:34:44.700
So now you have to enrich your higher centers

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:49.908
with your full self-confidence.

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:08.938
So now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen

00:35:09.138 --> 00:35:13.498
on the left hand side and press it.

00:35:17.883 --> 00:35:24.027
Here with full confidence, you have to say ten times:

00:35:24.227 --> 00:35:28.906
"Mother, I am my own master."

00:35:52.099 --> 00:35:57.259
I have already told you the fundamental truth about you

00:35:57.459 --> 00:36:03.126
that you are not this body, this mind, this ego, these conditionings,

00:36:03.326 --> 00:36:07.592
but you are the pure Spirit.

00:36:17.798 --> 00:36:23.512
So now, please raise your right hand on top of your heart

00:36:23.712 --> 00:36:30.106
and here you have to say with full confidence twelve times:

00:36:30.306 --> 00:36:35.876
"Mother, I am the pure Spirit."

00:36:57.293 --> 00:37:04.590
This All Pervading Power of Divine Love is the ocean of knowledge.

00:37:10.293 --> 00:37:19.340
It is the ocean of compassion and ocean of bliss.

00:37:23.059 --> 00:37:27.898
It is the ocean of miracles.

00:37:28.098 --> 00:37:33.004
But above all, It is the ocean of forgiveness.

00:37:35.739 --> 00:37:39.226
And all your mistakes can be easily dissolve

00:37:39.426 --> 00:37:43.825
by this ocean of forgiveness.

00:37:47.593 --> 00:37:51.198
So please forgive yourself and raise your right hand

00:37:51.398 --> 00:37:53.768
in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

00:37:53.968 --> 00:37:57.773
and turn your head to right.

00:38:09.263 --> 00:38:13.442
Please turn it to right.

00:38:15.614 --> 00:38:21.078
Now here you have to say with full self-confidence:

00:38:21.278 --> 00:38:26.700
"Mother, I am not guilty at all."

00:38:43.234 --> 00:38:46.487
I've already told you that

00:38:46.687 --> 00:38:52.546
logically whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything.

00:38:58.506 --> 00:39:05.217
But if you don't forgive, the you play into wrong hands all your life.

00:39:08.745 --> 00:39:12.404
And at this juncture, if you don't forgive,

00:39:12.604 --> 00:39:14.967
your Agnya Chakra won't open

00:39:15.167 --> 00:39:21.003
and the Kundalini will not be able to penetrate through it.

00:39:27.974 --> 00:39:32.571
So you have already tortured yourself all your life and now

00:39:32.771 --> 00:39:37.357
at this great moment, you miss your Self Realization.

00:39:45.181 --> 00:39:48.231
So now say in your heart,

00:39:48.431 --> 00:39:51.317
not how many times, but from your heart:

00:39:51.517 --> 00:39:58.494
"Mother, I forgive everyone in general." Don't think about them.

00:40:19.207 --> 00:40:22.648
Now you have to take your hand on the back side of your head

00:40:22.848 --> 00:40:26.320
and push back your head as far as possible.

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:31.070
Here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:37.715
just for your satisfaction, you have to say,

00:40:52.501 --> 00:40:56.687
say from your heart, not how many times:

00:41:00.953 --> 00:41:04.745
"Oh Divine Power, if I have done any mistakes,

00:41:04.945 --> 00:41:09.594
knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me."

00:41:28.525 --> 00:41:33.168
Now, the last center, is very important,

00:41:33.368 --> 00:41:37.626
we have to stretch our palm fully.

00:41:43.717 --> 00:41:47.830
And now we have to put our center of our palm

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:52.373
on top of fontanel bone area.

00:41:58.325 --> 00:42:02.857
Now stretch back your fingers, that's important.

00:42:05.982 --> 00:42:09.927
And please put down your head as far as possible.

00:42:15.436 --> 00:42:27.961
Here I again cannot cross over your freedom.

00:42:33.206 --> 00:42:43.712
Again you have to ask Me to give you Self Realization.

00:42:49.127 --> 00:42:53.208
So now move your scalp slowly

00:42:53.409 --> 00:42:56.379
clockwise seven times saying:

00:42:56.580 --> 00:43:02.283
"Mother, please give me Self Realization", seven times.

00:44:21.878 --> 00:44:25.644
Please take down your hands.

00:44:27.925 --> 00:44:32.283
And open your eyes, please.

00:44:33.791 --> 00:44:37.447
Please put both the hands towards Me like this.

00:44:44.613 --> 00:44:48.425
Like this, not like that.

00:44:49.597 --> 00:44:53.972
And watch Me without thinking.

00:44:55.630 --> 00:45:00.576
Now bend your head and see with your left hand

00:45:00.777 --> 00:45:06.139
if there's a cool, warm or a hot breeze like wave

00:45:06.339 --> 00:45:09.839
coming out of your own head.

00:45:20.277 --> 00:45:25.230
Put your hand on top of your head, but away from it.

00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:33.409
Some people get it too far.

00:45:37.127 --> 00:45:40.932
Now please put the left hand towards Me like this.

00:45:43.573 --> 00:45:46.263
And bend your head and now see with your right hand

00:45:46.463 --> 00:45:51.295
if there's a cool, warm or a hot breeze like wave

00:45:51.495 --> 00:45:55.260
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

00:46:04.423 --> 00:46:08.097
If it is warm or hot, it means you are not forgiving,

00:46:08.298 --> 00:46:12.746
so please forgive.

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:22.418
I cannot forgive for you, you have to forgive yourself.

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:30.177
Now, please put right hand.

00:46:30.378 --> 00:46:34.448
Bend your heads, bend your heads.

00:46:38.167 --> 00:46:44.412
And see with your left hand, if there's a cool breeze like waves

00:46:44.612 --> 00:46:50.909
or hot or warm coming out of your fontanel bone area.

00:46:58.897 --> 00:47:01.666
Now, please do it.

00:47:01.866 --> 00:47:05.858
Put both the hands towards the sky.

00:47:09.163 --> 00:47:12.936
And push back your head.

00:47:15.382 --> 00:47:21.796
Now, ask anyone of these three questions three times.

00:47:27.979 --> 00:47:36.154
"Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

00:47:36.354 --> 00:47:44.502
Or "Mother, is this the All Pervading Power of Love, Divine Love?"

00:47:50.043 --> 00:47:54.629
Or "Is it Brahma Chaitanya."

00:47:54.903 --> 00:47:59.192
Anyone of these questions, you can ask three times.

00:48:05.132 --> 00:48:08.975
Now take down your hands.

00:48:16.247 --> 00:48:19.301
Put your hands like this.

00:48:23.676 --> 00:48:27.489
You can feel your silence within yourself.

00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:38.375
Now, all those who have felt cool breeze on their fingertips,

00:48:38.575 --> 00:48:42.015
or hot or warm breeze on their fingertips,

00:48:42.215 --> 00:48:49.632
or the same on their hands or out of their fontanel bone area,

00:48:49.832 --> 00:48:54.293
please raise both your hands.

00:49:06.099 --> 00:49:09.961
Please raise both.

00:49:10.161 --> 00:49:14.239
That is Brasilia. May God Bless you.

00:49:15.872 --> 00:49:21.208
I bow to you all. You all have started your saintly life.

00:49:26.763 --> 00:49:30.779
Every where, all of you have got it.

00:49:33.037 --> 00:49:37.165
May God bless you all.

00:49:37.365 --> 00:49:44.318
There is to be - it is to be understood that you have gone beyond your mind.

00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:53.140
So don't argue and don't doubt.

00:49:56.452 --> 00:50:00.713
We have here a very good center for you,

00:50:00.913 --> 00:50:05.960
where you must learn how to make this connection perfect.

00:50:13.788 --> 00:50:21.671
All the knowledge about your subtle system, everything you will know.

00:50:27.856 --> 00:50:33.238
But one should know that you can only grow in collectivity.

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:43.901
Supposing one nail is cut out of My body, it will never grow.

00:50:48.387 --> 00:50:54.515
So you have to be humble about it and you should, all of you,

00:50:54.715 --> 00:50:58.340
master this art.

00:51:03.977 --> 00:51:10.273
You will have the powers to raise the Kundalini of others and awaken them.

00:51:14.738 --> 00:51:18.848
You can cure people, you can do so many things.

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:25.949
And for all this, you don't have to pay at all.

00:51:29.621 --> 00:51:32.081
You don't have to be also obliged,

00:51:32.282 --> 00:51:36.582
because it is your own power it has worked it.

00:51:41.255 --> 00:51:45.521
It is your honest seeking it has worked out.

00:51:50.107 --> 00:51:53.117
I will definitely come next year here again for a longer period.

00:51:53.318 --> 00:51:57.264
por um período mais longo.

00:52:00.699 --> 00:52:05.140
I would love you all to grow into your wisdom

00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:09.683
like a great tree of spirituality.

00:52:16.371 --> 00:52:19.996
May God Bless you all.
