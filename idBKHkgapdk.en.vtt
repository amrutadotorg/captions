﻿Public Program. Brasilia, Brazil, 1992-1015

01:28.668 --> 01:33.770
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

01:40.413 --> 01:45.437
We have to know that truth is what it is.

01:46.227 --> 01:51.165
We cannot change it, we cannot transform it,

01:52.168 --> 01:55.385
we cannot read about it.

01:57.277 --> 02:03.621
Also, unfortunately at this human awareness, we cannot know it.

02:06.468 --> 02:11.291
We have to become the Spirit.

02:13.974 --> 02:17.141
Whatever I am going to tell you today,

02:17.342 --> 02:21.600
you need not believe me blindfolded.

02:24.605 --> 02:29.830
But keep your mind open as a scientist has.

02:30.364 --> 02:34.660
Treat is as a hypothesis.

02:35.356 --> 02:40.352
And if it turns to be the truth,

02:40.553 --> 02:45.326
you have to accept it as honest people.

02:45.717 --> 02:52.744
Because it is for the benevolence

02:52.945 --> 02:55.079
of your own, benevolence of your country

02:55.280 --> 02:59.358
and benevolence of the whole world.

03:01.719 --> 03:05.626
We are born in a very special time today.

03:06.476 --> 03:11.468
These are the times when lots of things are going to happen.

03:12.384 --> 03:17.020
And people will be in illusions,

03:17.220 --> 03:21.869
won't understand what is right and what is wrong.

03:22.185 --> 03:29.208
But at this time only, there are many who are seeking the truth.

03:30.134 --> 03:34.204
They are not sticking on to any one book

03:34.405 --> 03:37.228
or sticking on to one ideology.

03:37.429 --> 03:42.420
But they want to know what is beyond.

03:42.621 --> 03:47.262
They are a special category of people.

03:48.445 --> 03:52.558
William Blake, a great poet, has said that

03:52.759 --> 03:57.486
"Men of God will be born in those days.

03:58.248 --> 04:01.579
And they will find their divinity

04:01.780 --> 04:06.276
and they will make others divine."

04:07.281 --> 04:15.180
Believe Me, you all have your divinity intact within yourself.

04:16.089 --> 04:20.535
It cannot be tarnished,

04:20.736 --> 04:26.290
it cannot be destroyed whatever you might have done to yourself.

04:26.735 --> 04:31.125
Because it is eternal in nature.

04:31.718 --> 04:37.491
Only question is of manifesting this divinity

04:38.866 --> 04:45.507
through your ascent into a new realm of reality.

04:46.595 --> 04:50.720
You are all ready for it.

04:51.478 --> 04:56.759
There is no more fasting or suffering needed.

04:57.627 --> 05:03.267
There is no need to change you dress and you foods.

05:03.737 --> 05:09.346
It is the internal happening that is important.

05:11.152 --> 05:16.272
You have been already told about

05:16.472 --> 05:21.183
the subtle system that works it out.

05:23.008 --> 05:28.987
When this power called Kundalini, which resides in the sacrum bone,

05:29.188 --> 05:34.587
awakens, She passes through six centers.

05:36.556 --> 05:39.603
The Greeks perhaps knew it was a sacrum bone,

05:39.811 --> 05:44.022
so they call it a sacrum.

05:45.309 --> 05:51.605
And this is awaken just like a seed is sprouted,

05:52.540 --> 05:57.633
because the seed has the built in quality to sprout.

05:59.272 --> 06:03.967
All living process is spontaneous.

06:06.486 --> 06:10.192
So there are two things we should know

06:10.393 --> 06:14.471
when we are seeking the truth.

06:18.734 --> 06:25.166
The first one is that you are not this body, this mind,

06:25.367 --> 06:29.097
this ego, this conditioning,

06:29.298 --> 06:33.595
but you are the pure Spirit.

06:34.551 --> 06:40.249
The second truth is that there is an All Pervading Divine Power

06:40.450 --> 06:45.083
which does all the living work.

06:45.599 --> 06:50.873
You see these beautiful plants, it is a miracle.

06:51.255 --> 06:55.310
But we take it for granted.

06:56.045 --> 07:00.830
We have these eyes which are, which is a camera.

07:01.031 --> 07:05.882
It is a miracle, but we take it for granted.

07:06.895 --> 07:13.414
Then look at our brain, which is such a great computer,

07:13.615 --> 07:17.646
but we take it for granted.

07:18.528 --> 07:22.872
If you ask a doctor who runs your heart,

07:23.100 --> 07:27.771
he will say it is the autonomous nervous system.

07:28.226 --> 07:31.843
Now, who is this auto?

07:33.352 --> 07:40.868
So there is some power which is working out all these living miracles.

07:41.585 --> 07:45.479
So the first truth is that you are the pure Spirit

07:45.680 --> 07:54.336
and the second one is that there is this All Pervading Power of Divine Love.

07:55.582 --> 08:01.214
We cannot feel it, we cannot see it, but it exists.

08:05.884 --> 08:10.653
Now when this Power rises through these centers,

08:10.854 --> 08:14.940
It nourishes those centers.

08:15.522 --> 08:25.663
All human problems are because of these centers.

08:26.616 --> 08:30.197
And if these centers are put right,

08:30.398 --> 08:35.914
all your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual problems

08:36.115 --> 08:40.443
can be solved.

08:40.682 --> 08:44.783
It is as simple as that.

08:47.159 --> 08:52.521
Also I would like to tell you in short

08:52.722 --> 08:57.316
what happens to your awareness.

08:58.287 --> 09:03.618
When this Kundalini connects you to the mains

09:03.819 --> 09:06.826
as this instrument when connected to the mains

09:07.027 --> 09:10.771
has some meaning,

09:11.371 --> 09:15.668
so you too have some meaning.

09:17.888 --> 09:25.075
But it makes you stand in the present.

09:25.982 --> 09:31.517
We are all the time jumping on the cusp of the thoughts

09:31.718 --> 09:36.866
which are coming from the past or from the present.

09:37.466 --> 09:42.086
But then when the Kundalini rises, She separates those thoughts

09:42.287 --> 09:46.451
and the space in between is the present.

09:47.550 --> 09:50.003
So you develop a new awareness

09:50.204 --> 09:54.221
called as thoughtless awareness.

09:54.860 --> 09:56.980
You are aware, fully aware,

09:57.181 --> 10:02.298
but there is no thought in your mind to disturb you.

10:03.585 --> 10:08.773
Thus you achieve peace within yourself.

10:11.242 --> 10:15.647
There a many people who have got prices for peace,

10:15.848 --> 10:20.199
but I am not seeing that peace within themselves.

10:21.070 --> 10:27.718
So this peace within us is existing there, we become that peace.

10:27.919 --> 10:30.774
And such a person emits peace

10:30.975 --> 10:35.530
and neutralizes violence and anger.

10:38.131 --> 10:45.123
Now the nature of the Spirit is that Spirit is the universal being.

10:47.159 --> 10:51.527
We are also universal.

10:52.104 --> 10:55.928
If you cut a part of your body,

10:56.129 --> 11:00.726
you'll find every one has the same bone,

11:00.927 --> 11:05.637
the same muscle, the same artery.

11:06.609 --> 11:12.734
So we are all inside universal.

11:13.591 --> 11:18.294
We laugh the same way, we smile the same.

11:18.891 --> 11:22.859
The difference is just skin deep.

11:23.533 --> 11:28.429
That is also just to create variety,

11:28.630 --> 11:32.872
otherwise it would have been boring.

11:33.371 --> 11:37.059
But this universal like nature within us

11:37.260 --> 11:43.541
is manifested when the light of the Spirit comes into our consciousness.

11:44.064 --> 11:50.832
We transcend all the barriers of races, cast, community,

11:51.033 --> 11:55.166
religion and nations.

11:55.628 --> 12:00.284
In short, you become part and parcel of the whole.

12:01.943 --> 12:07.295
Like the microcosm become the macrocosm.

12:08.229 --> 12:11.980
But it is a becoming, it is not just a lecture

12:12.181 --> 12:14.481
or telling something or a false certificate,

12:14.682 --> 12:18.822
but is the becoming that is important.

12:20.478 --> 12:25.132
And you develop a balance in your life.

12:26.423 --> 12:30.532
Moreover you become innately righteous.

12:31.095 --> 12:35.308
For example, you're maybe a Hindu, Christian, Muslim, anything.

12:35.509 --> 12:39.805
You can commit any sin.

12:40.825 --> 12:43.899
But once you become the Spirit,

12:44.100 --> 12:49.483
you become above everything that is wrong.

12:51.024 --> 12:59.932
You get your sense of security and your power.

13:01.528 --> 13:06.395
Sense of security and your power of love.

13:07.116 --> 13:10.991
This power is flowing in you then.

13:12.706 --> 13:17.210
With that power, you become extremely compassionate

13:17.410 --> 13:21.442
and extremely dynamic.

13:22.308 --> 13:26.811
But when the light of the Spirit comes into you attention,

13:27.012 --> 13:31.223
your attention becomes enlightened

13:31.732 --> 13:36.122
Whenever you put your attention, it acts.

13:39.857 --> 13:44.477
the another great thing about the Spirit is that

13:44.678 --> 13:49.358
It is the source of absolute knowledge.

13:50.731 --> 13:54.617
Like you have ten children together, tie their eyes

13:54.818 --> 13:59.458
of our masterask them about somebody: "What is wrong with this person?"

14:00.342 --> 14:04.464
Now, all your centers are in your hand reflected,

14:04.665 --> 14:10.139
sympathetic, five, six, seven centers.

14:10.740 --> 14:15.100
They all will raise one finger like this.

14:15.618 --> 14:20.571
Ask the gentleman: "Have you got heart trouble?"

14:21.369 --> 14:24.837
He will say: "Hoe do you know?"

14:25.532 --> 14:29.547
Because everyone will know the same thing.

14:30.109 --> 14:33.034
As you all can see Me sitting here, that is all.

14:33.234 --> 14:37.367
You see the same thing.

14:37.742 --> 14:42.699
So then there are no dogmas, no theories, nothing of the kind,

14:42.900 --> 14:46.962
but actually you see the reality.

14:47.621 --> 14:51.668
Then who is going to quarrel?

14:52.722 --> 14:56.730
How can there is difference of opinion,

14:58.058 --> 15:02.183
There cannot be wars then at all.

15:05.246 --> 15:12.270
But the Spirit is the ocean of joy.

15:13.166 --> 15:17.935
And after you get your Self Realization,

15:18.136 --> 15:22.652
you feel as if you are swimming in the ocean of joy.

15:22.853 --> 15:28.454
You get separated from your problems and you see them as a witness.

15:29.452 --> 15:33.499
And then you can solve them much better.

15:34.008 --> 15:39.289
Without getting involved into it or upset about it.

15:41.580 --> 15:48.479
I am so very happy to be in Brazil, specially in Brasilia.

15:49.233 --> 15:53.952
No doubt, this is a very spiritual place.

15:54.153 --> 15:58.523
There are great seekers and one day this may become

15:58.724 --> 16:03.646
the greatest spiritual nucleus for the whole world.

16:05.650 --> 16:11.197
You can get your Realization in hardly ten minutes time.

16:12.565 --> 16:17.479
In this short time, I cannot tell you all about it.

16:18.153 --> 16:20.906
In this hall, say, there are so many lights

16:21.107 --> 16:26.599
and only you put on the switch and you get the lights there.

16:27.067 --> 16:31.192
Because it is all built in.

16:32.427 --> 16:36.231
No use telling you about the history of electricity,

16:36.432 --> 16:41.888
how it was brought to Brasilia, it is all boring.

16:42.478 --> 16:47.338
So the best thing is to get your Realization.

16:47.830 --> 16:51.830
I know you have some questions in your mind.

16:52.282 --> 16:56.439
And I would love to answer them.

16:56.640 --> 17:02.054
After your Self Realization, you may change your mind.

17:02.799 --> 17:06.892
So why not get your Self Realization?

17:08.103 --> 17:12.541
You can't pay for it.

17:13.415 --> 17:18.532
It is a living process of your evolution.

17:19.166 --> 17:24.455
Without this happening, you can never be satisfied with yourself.

17:25.710 --> 17:32.312
Anybody who ask money in the name of God is a hypocrite.

17:33.245 --> 17:38.370
Because God doesn't understand money and banking.

17:39.037 --> 17:43.372
It is the headache of human beings.

17:45.808 --> 17:53.261
So now, I would say that you all can get your Self Realization.

17:54.506 --> 17:59.741
But I cannot force on you because I respect your freedom.

18:00.889 --> 18:04.983
Those who want to have can get it

18:05.184 --> 18:10.981
and those who don't want to have, it cannot be.

18:11.508 --> 18:18.219
Christ has said that "The meek will inherit the Earth."

18:19.621 --> 18:24.637
So Sahaja Yoga is not meant for arrogant people

18:25.374 --> 18:30.296
nor it is meant for people who are stupid.

18:31.696 --> 18:38.008
It is meant for people who are truly seeking the truth.

18:39.347 --> 18:45.749
So I will request people who do not want to have their Realization

18:45.950 --> 18:49.981
should leave the hall.

18:51.070 --> 18:56.394
It will be very kind. And also very civil on their part

18:56.595 --> 19:00.915
not to stay here and watch others.

19:02.299 --> 19:07.544
If you are sticking on to some sort of a ideology,

19:07.745 --> 19:11.885
then also is difficult.

19:12.935 --> 19:17.045
You must keep your mind open,

19:18.984 --> 19:22.449
then it works.

19:23.508 --> 19:27.594
So I said it won't take much time.

19:28.969 --> 19:31.043
And leave about half a minute

19:31.244 --> 19:35.720
for you to leave with those who wants to leave.

19:48.842 --> 19:54.700
Alright. Such a wonderful thing that no one wants to leave.

19:55.221 --> 19:57.384
Alright.

19:57.673 --> 20:02.204
So there are three conditions which are very simple.

20:03.107 --> 20:06.172
The first condition is

20:06.373 --> 20:14.720
that you all have to be absolutely self-confident

20:14.921 --> 20:20.718
that you all will get your Self Realization tonight.

20:23.808 --> 20:28.395
So the second one is follows that

20:28.596 --> 20:32.878
you are not to condemn yourself for anything,

20:33.830 --> 20:37.666
You have to forget the past.

20:38.697 --> 20:42.713
And don't feel guilty at all.

20:43.512 --> 20:45.735
If you have done committed some mistakes,

20:45.936 --> 20:50.365
after all you are human begins, you are not gods.

20:51.020 --> 20:57.301
And this All Pervading Power is a ocean of forgiveness.

20:58.471 --> 21:04.205
So all your mistakes can be easily neutralized by that.

21:08.102 --> 21:12.219
So please don't feel guilty.

21:12.747 --> 21:18.641
If you feel guilty, it works against the center on the left-handed side,

21:18.842 --> 21:22.647
this center on the left-handed side.

21:23.355 --> 21:29.233
And you can get diseases like angina, like spondylitis,

21:29.433 --> 21:33.847
could be lethargic organs.

21:35.110 --> 21:39.524
And at this time, if the centers are blocked,

21:39.725 --> 21:43.858
how will the Kundalini rises?

21:45.171 --> 21:47.171
So as they say in English language is the

21:47.372 --> 21:51.220
pain in the neck, you see that.

21:51.421 --> 21:54.632
...pain in the neck

21:55.174 --> 21:59.307
So let's get rid of that pain in the neck.

22:03.891 --> 22:06.582
In short, you should be very pleasantly placed

22:06.783 --> 22:10.610
towards yourself.

22:11.638 --> 22:18.036
Because you are glorious, you are magnificent.

22:19.095 --> 22:22.794
You are fantastic.

22:22.995 --> 22:27.291
Because you are not connected, you don't know what you are.

22:28.474 --> 22:33.172
Like a, supposing in an Indian village I take a television

22:33.373 --> 22:37.454
and tell them that you can see lots of films,

22:37.655 --> 22:42.960
then he will say: "Oh, what is this box? How can you see films in this?"

22:44.447 --> 22:46.989
But once you get it connected,

22:47.190 --> 22:51.378
you can see what fantastic thing it is.

22:52.378 --> 22:57.721
We also think about ourselves that we are just a box.

22:58.122 --> 23:02.591
But you do not know how many powers there are within you.

23:04.203 --> 23:06.191
So you should be very pleasantly placed

23:06.392 --> 23:10.000
towards yourself.

23:10.473 --> 23:14.543
Because now you have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

23:15.235 --> 23:19.019
That Kingdom of God is the most efficient,

23:19.220 --> 23:26.143
is the most loving organization.

23:28.343 --> 23:36.944
The third condition is even simpler that you have to forgive everyone.

23:38.685 --> 23:43.395
Many people say is very difficult to forgive.

23:44.326 --> 23:46.326
Logically, if you see,

23:46.527 --> 23:50.858
whether you forgive or you don't forgive, what do you do?

23:51.626 --> 23:54.480
You don't do anything.

23:54.681 --> 23:59.556
But when you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

24:00.292 --> 24:04.483
Those who have troubled you and have tortured you are happy,

24:04.684 --> 24:09.418
and you are torturing yourself on their behalf.

24:11.024 --> 24:18.806
But also the center of optical chiasma is like that in the Agnya Chakra.

24:19.542 --> 24:24.998
And this will never open unless and until you forgive.

24:26.133 --> 24:32.086
So you have to forgive, otherwise this won't open like this.

24:32.849 --> 24:36.329
As it is you are torturing yourself

24:36.530 --> 24:41.401
all your life and now at this very important moment,

24:41.602 --> 24:45.758
you will miss your Self Realization.

24:46.466 --> 24:51.784
So just to forgive all of them, even don't think about them.

24:52.497 --> 24:56.942
Even thinking about them is a headache.

24:57.700 --> 25:02.638
So in your heart, you should forgive all of them in general.

25:05.023 --> 25:09.067
These are the only three conditions.

25:09.268 --> 25:12.512
First is that you should be fully self-confident

25:12.713 --> 25:16.760
that you all will get your Realization.

25:17.785 --> 25:24.441
The second one is that you are not guilty at all.

25:25.283 --> 25:32.564
And the third one is we have to forgive everyone in general.

25:33.495 --> 25:40.011
Now we have to take out our shoes because this Mother Earth helps us a lot.

25:54.645 --> 25:59.785
Please sit inside otherwise, you have all to sit down.

25:59.986 --> 26:04.035
Don't be standing, please.

26:10.266 --> 26:14.274
There is some room here, behind.

26:39.256 --> 26:43.667
Now those who are sitting on the chairs, not on the ground,

26:43.868 --> 26:46.762
have to put both their feet on both the sides

26:46.963 --> 26:51.830
because left and right are two different powers.

26:52.549 --> 26:57.182
The left side power is the power of desire,

26:57.859 --> 27:02.523
And the right side one is the power of action.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.976
So now we put our left hand

27:06.177 --> 27:11.015
on our lap very comfortably.

27:12.461 --> 27:16.828
Someone has to come and show here.

27:17.696 --> 27:23.680
And the right hand we use for nourishing our centers.

27:25.544 --> 27:29.596
The left hand suggests that you are desirous

27:29.797 --> 27:35.160
of Self Realization, you have a strong desire to have Self Realization.

27:36.009 --> 27:39.410
And the right one is for the action.

27:39.611 --> 27:44.236
So first we put our right hand on our heart.

27:44.784 --> 27:49.112
In the heart resides the Spirit.

27:57.214 --> 28:01.772
So now if you become the Spirit, you become

28:01.973 --> 28:07.231
in the light of the Spirit, your own guide, your own master.

28:09.487 --> 28:14.436
So we take our hand in the upper portion of abdomen

28:14.637 --> 28:18.207
on left hand side,

28:19.323 --> 28:23.745
which is the center of our mastery.

28:26.238 --> 28:31.054
Then we take our right hand in the lower portion of abdomen

28:31.255 --> 28:34.958
on left hand side,

28:35.406 --> 28:43.515
which is the center of pure knowledge of Divine Laws.

28:45.513 --> 28:51.614
Then we raise again our right hand in the upper portion of abdomen.

28:52.150 --> 28:55.977
Then on our heart.

28:56.604 --> 29:00.139
Then in the corner of our neck and our shoulder

29:00.340 --> 29:03.973
and turn our head to right.

29:05.102 --> 29:09.363
I've already told you about this center that when you feel guilty,

29:09.564 --> 29:13.369
it goes out of order.

29:14.635 --> 29:20.513
Now we take our right hand and put it across our forehead

29:20.714 --> 29:24.558
and put down our head.

29:25.704 --> 29:33.555
This is the center to forgive everyone in general.

29:34.985 --> 29:40.512
Now we take back our right hand on the back side of our head

29:40.713 --> 29:45.408
and push back our head as far as possible.

29:46.112 --> 29:51.131
This is the center where without feeling guilty,

29:51.332 --> 29:55.335
without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction,

29:55.536 --> 30:00.411
you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine Power.

30:01.423 --> 30:03.821
Now the last center, you have to

30:04.022 --> 30:08.671
stretch your palm fully.

30:09.576 --> 30:14.615
And put the center of your palm on top of fontanel bone area

30:14.816 --> 30:19.545
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

30:20.517 --> 30:24.048
Now please bend your head.

30:24.594 --> 30:27.591
Very important is to push back your fingers,

30:27.792 --> 30:31.760
so that there is a good pression on your scalp.

30:32.180 --> 30:41.664
Please now move your scalp clockwise seven times slowly.

30:45.529 --> 30:49.451
Please put down your hands.

30:51.371 --> 30:53.678
That is all we have to do now.

30:53.879 --> 30:56.101
We have to now close our eyes

30:56.302 --> 31:00.849
and please don't open them till I tell you.

31:01.356 --> 31:05.659
You can take out your glasses.

31:10.106 --> 31:14.157
Now, again, please put both feet apart from each other,

31:14.357 --> 31:19.107
put left hand like this and the right hand on the heart.

31:26.002 --> 31:30.229
And now please close your eyes.

31:32.932 --> 31:36.786
Here resides the Spirit,

31:36.986 --> 31:41.874
so you have to ask Me a very fundamental question about yourself.

31:42.074 --> 31:47.020
You may call Me Mother or you may call Me Shri Mataji.

31:57.253 --> 32:03.417
Please ask Me three time in your heart: "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

32:15.751 --> 32:20.223
I already told you that if you are the Spirit,

32:20.423 --> 32:24.587
you become your own master.

32:30.610 --> 32:33.012
So now, please take your right hand

32:33.212 --> 32:37.360
in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

32:43.010 --> 32:46.908
You are working only on the left hand side.

32:48.806 --> 32:57.427
Here again you have to ask a fundamental question three times:

32:57.627 --> 33:02.111
"Mother, am I my own master?"

33:10.552 --> 33:16.951
Now, I have already told you that I respect your freedom

33:17.151 --> 33:24.443
and I cannot force the pure knowledge of Divine on you,

33:24.643 --> 33:28.382
you have to ask for it.

33:36.521 --> 33:38.548
So now you have to take your right hand

33:38.748 --> 33:41.148
in the lower portion of your abdomen

33:41.349 --> 33:45.533
on the left hand side and press it and here

33:45.733 --> 33:48.174
you have to ask six times,

33:48.374 --> 33:52.768
because this center has got six petals.

33:52.968 --> 34:01.233
Please say six time: "Mother, please give me pure knowledge."

34:25.597 --> 34:31.272
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge,

34:31.472 --> 34:34.681
your Kundalini starts rising.

34:34.881 --> 34:44.700
So now you have to enrich your higher centers

34:44.900 --> 34:49.908
with your full self-confidence.

35:05.990 --> 35:08.938
So now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen

35:09.138 --> 35:13.498
on the left hand side and press it.

35:17.883 --> 35:24.027
Here with full confidence, you have to say ten times:

35:24.227 --> 35:28.906
"Mother, I am my own master."

35:52.099 --> 35:57.259
I have already told you the fundamental truth about you

35:57.459 --> 36:03.126
that you are not this body, this mind, this ego, these conditionings,

36:03.326 --> 36:07.592
but you are the pure Spirit.

36:17.798 --> 36:23.512
So now, please raise your right hand on top of your heart

36:23.712 --> 36:30.106
and here you have to say with full confidence twelve times:

36:30.306 --> 36:35.876
"Mother, I am the pure Spirit."

36:57.293 --> 37:04.590
This All Pervading Power of Divine Love is the ocean of knowledge.

37:10.293 --> 37:19.340
It is the ocean of compassion and ocean of bliss.

37:23.059 --> 37:27.898
It is the ocean of miracles.

37:28.098 --> 37:33.004
But above all, It is the ocean of forgiveness.

37:35.739 --> 37:39.226
And all your mistakes can be easily dissolve

37:39.426 --> 37:43.825
by this ocean of forgiveness.

37:47.593 --> 37:51.198
So please forgive yourself and raise your right hand

37:51.398 --> 37:53.768
in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

37:53.968 --> 37:57.773
and turn your head to right.

38:09.263 --> 38:13.442
Please turn it to right.

38:15.614 --> 38:21.078
Now here you have to say with full self-confidence:

38:21.278 --> 38:26.700
"Mother, I am not guilty at all."

38:43.234 --> 38:46.487
I've already told you that

38:46.687 --> 38:52.546
logically whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything.

38:58.506 --> 39:05.217
But if you don't forgive, the you play into wrong hands all your life.

39:08.745 --> 39:12.404
And at this juncture, if you don't forgive,

39:12.604 --> 39:14.967
your Agnya Chakra won't open

39:15.167 --> 39:21.003
and the Kundalini will not be able to penetrate through it.

39:27.974 --> 39:32.571
So you have already tortured yourself all your life and now

39:32.771 --> 39:37.357
at this great moment, you miss your Self Realization.

39:45.181 --> 39:48.231
So now say in your heart,

39:48.431 --> 39:51.317
not how many times, but from your heart:

39:51.517 --> 39:58.494
"Mother, I forgive everyone in general." Don't think about them.

40:19.207 --> 40:22.648
Now you have to take your hand on the back side of your head

40:22.848 --> 40:26.320
and push back your head as far as possible.

40:26.520 --> 40:31.070
Here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

40:31.270 --> 40:37.715
just for your satisfaction, you have to say,

40:52.501 --> 40:56.687
say from your heart, not how many times:

41:00.953 --> 41:04.745
"Oh Divine Power, if I have done any mistakes,

41:04.945 --> 41:09.594
knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me."

41:28.525 --> 41:33.168
Now, the last center, is very important,

41:33.368 --> 41:37.626
we have to stretch our palm fully.

41:43.717 --> 41:47.830
And now we have to put our center of our palm

41:48.030 --> 41:52.373
on top of fontanel bone area.

41:58.325 --> 42:02.857
Now stretch back your fingers, that's important.

42:05.982 --> 42:09.927
And please put down your head as far as possible.

42:15.436 --> 42:27.961
Here I again cannot cross over your freedom.

42:33.206 --> 42:43.712
Again you have to ask Me to give you Self Realization.

42:49.127 --> 42:53.208
So now move your scalp slowly

42:53.409 --> 42:56.379
clockwise seven times saying:

42:56.580 --> 43:02.283
"Mother, please give me Self Realization", seven times.

44:21.878 --> 44:25.644
Please take down your hands.

44:27.925 --> 44:32.283
And open your eyes, please.

44:33.791 --> 44:37.447
Please put both the hands towards Me like this.

44:44.613 --> 44:48.425
Like this, not like that.

44:49.597 --> 44:53.972
And watch Me without thinking.

44:55.630 --> 45:00.576
Now bend your head and see with your left hand

45:00.777 --> 45:06.139
if there's a cool, warm or a hot breeze like wave

45:06.339 --> 45:09.839
coming out of your own head.

45:20.277 --> 45:25.230
Put your hand on top of your head, but away from it.

45:29.510 --> 45:33.409
Some people get it too far.

45:37.127 --> 45:40.932
Now please put the left hand towards Me like this.

45:43.573 --> 45:46.263
And bend your head and now see with your right hand

45:46.463 --> 45:51.295
if there's a cool, warm or a hot breeze like wave

45:51.495 --> 45:55.260
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

46:04.423 --> 46:08.097
If it is warm or hot, it means you are not forgiving,

46:08.298 --> 46:12.746
so please forgive.

46:17.590 --> 46:22.418
I cannot forgive for you, you have to forgive yourself.

46:27.590 --> 46:30.177
Now, please put right hand.

46:30.378 --> 46:34.448
Bend your heads, bend your heads.

46:38.167 --> 46:44.412
And see with your left hand, if there's a cool breeze like waves

46:44.612 --> 46:50.909
or hot or warm coming out of your fontanel bone area.

46:58.897 --> 47:01.666
Now, please do it.

47:01.866 --> 47:05.858
Put both the hands towards the sky.

47:09.163 --> 47:12.936
And push back your head.

47:15.382 --> 47:21.796
Now, ask anyone of these three questions three times.

47:27.979 --> 47:36.154
"Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

47:36.354 --> 47:44.502
Or "Mother, is this the All Pervading Power of Love, Divine Love?"

47:50.043 --> 47:54.629
Or "Is it Brahma Chaitanya."

47:54.903 --> 47:59.192
Anyone of these questions, you can ask three times.

48:05.132 --> 48:08.975
Now take down your hands.

48:16.247 --> 48:19.301
Put your hands like this.

48:23.676 --> 48:27.489
You can feel your silence within yourself.

48:31.590 --> 48:38.375
Now, all those who have felt cool breeze on their fingertips,

48:38.575 --> 48:42.015
or hot or warm breeze on their fingertips,

48:42.215 --> 48:49.632
or the same on their hands or out of their fontanel bone area,

48:49.832 --> 48:54.293
please raise both your hands.

49:06.099 --> 49:09.961
Please raise both.

49:10.161 --> 49:14.239
That is Brasilia. May God Bless you.

49:15.872 --> 49:21.208
I bow to you all. You all have started your saintly life.

49:26.763 --> 49:30.779
Every where, all of you have got it.

49:33.037 --> 49:37.165
May God bless you all.

49:37.365 --> 49:44.318
There is to be - it is to be understood that you have gone beyond your mind.

49:48.890 --> 49:53.140
So don't argue and don't doubt.

49:56.452 --> 50:00.713
We have here a very good center for you,

50:00.913 --> 50:05.960
where you must learn how to make this connection perfect.

50:13.788 --> 50:21.671
All the knowledge about your subtle system, everything you will know.

50:27.856 --> 50:33.238
But one should know that you can only grow in collectivity.

50:37.940 --> 50:43.901
Supposing one nail is cut out of My body, it will never grow.

50:48.387 --> 50:54.515
So you have to be humble about it and you should, all of you,

50:54.715 --> 50:58.340
master this art.

51:03.977 --> 51:10.273
You will have the powers to raise the Kundalini of others and awaken them.

51:14.738 --> 51:18.848
You can cure people, you can do so many things.

51:22.160 --> 51:25.949
And for all this, you don't have to pay at all.

51:29.621 --> 51:32.081
You don't have to be also obliged,

51:32.282 --> 51:36.582
because it is your own power it has worked it.

51:41.255 --> 51:45.521
It is your honest seeking it has worked out.

51:50.107 --> 51:53.117
I will definitely come next year here again for a longer period.

51:53.318 --> 51:57.264
por um período mais longo.

52:00.699 --> 52:05.140
I would love you all to grow into your wisdom

52:05.340 --> 52:09.683
like a great tree of spirituality.

52:16.371 --> 52:19.996
May God Bless you all.
