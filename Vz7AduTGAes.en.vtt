Gregore

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.160
Yes Mother.

boys and everybody who is not a Br

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.920
Facing the boys you should stand, the brides should stand facing.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.840
Each bride, if  she can recognize her future husband

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.600
Place the brides where please no mistake...

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.440
Please move in, move in this side all the brides.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.800
(UNCLEAR) All right? And now, just face them,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.760
and now you see and

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.000
now say that would you like to marry them.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.320
Everybody should say, "Yes, come along."

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:32.240
Yes, Oui.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.440
Don't wash. Just rub the earth like

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.960
substance, just rub it off without..

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.400
Rub it in a way that you can collect it.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.280
Rub it in such a way that you can collect it to keep it afterwards.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.240
[UNCLEAR]

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.720
Thank you. Beautiful.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.360
[UNCLEAR] This there is going inside that.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.120
[UNCLEAR]

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.200
With great love and affection, with kindness and sweetness.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.200
Sweetness, with a sweetness.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.840
Don't put it out with fingers.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.640
Beautiful.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.520
Actually it is not that in India.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.760
Now anybody who does not want to have marriage after this

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.960
can decide that.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.920
That's the chance.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.560
Better wipe it nicely.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.120
[UNCLEAR]

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.640
[UNCLEAR]

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.160
It's alright, brush it off.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.880
Who? [UNCLEAR]

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.960
You could have brought the children.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:34.160
I think we should have two rows, can't just fit there.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.560
Can we have two rows of boys.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.320
Just move on, just move.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:28.760
Alright. Now when you take your photograph...

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.960
What about the boys, have you (UNCLEAR)

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.920
[UNCLEAR] should be more flowers.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.920
It is called as"Jaimaal" (garland).

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:54.640
Come here. Hey come along, move few of you here.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.040
Alright now look at your eyes.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.920
Lift her veil, you have to lift her veil.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.520
Now lift her veil not that, that's all right!

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.320
You put it back.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:33.920
[UNCLEAR] this way. No, let it be in the ear, let it be. Yes, good.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.640
Very good. Now this is the [VIDEO INTERRUPTION]

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.440
Stand behind there.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:01.520
[UNCLEAR] You kiss her now.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:18.000
[UNCLEAR] Good. Now kiss her.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.840
You just stand here, alright.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.280
Good, now please come.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.520
What about the boys? Your bring them now.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.880
[UNCLEAR]

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.840
No, its alright, you stand here.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.640
Now put her a garldand.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.960
Great!

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.320
[UNCLEAR]

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.000
Now those who are married should go at the back.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.840
I mean those who have been garlanded.

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:42.560
I was looking [UNCLEAR]. Garland, garland, go.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:21.240
So now all of you should walk with your brides there.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.840
You can never do it justice. Never.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.920
It's raining.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.680
It's obviously getting someone video at Mother's feet.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:19.920
[INDIAN]

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.320
[UNCLEAR]

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.440
May God bless you!

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.000
[UNCLEAR] you go for a new honeymoon now.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.840
[UNCLEAR]

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.320
Come on.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.880
[UNCLEAR]

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.040
May God bless you!

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.000
They are really surrendered, both of them.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.120
In a second they accepted.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:16.280
So well surrendered both of them, in a second.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:25.560
See now, surrendering is the only way you get your vibrations.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.400
May God bless you!

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:08.280
So I sit down here. You see, I think the girls have to sit in front

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.680
first and then the boys.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.720
[UNCLEAR]

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.400
I think this you can move now to another end.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.320
May God bless you!

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.480

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.320
[UNCLEAR]

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:14.160
Put your hands under My feet. Both the hands.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.480
Now through you America should be awakened.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.400
Wait, sit down.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.840
Don't cry!

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:41.080

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:56.720
All of you have, you have?

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:29.040
If you can do after this a big havan [UNCLEAR]

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:33.240
[UNCLEAR]

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:41.680
Water please. Water.

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:45.920
Some four cups of [UNCLEAR] we can do."

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:50.880
No no, silence.

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:56.200
Please sit down all of you. All of you sit down.

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:58.760
The photographer sit down now.

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:02.560
Now during the wedding only one person should take photographs,

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:04.040
not all of you, alright.

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:05.760
Now ladies and gentlemen,

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:09.480
just to start with,

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.720
may I with the whole

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.920
my devotion in my heart

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:17.400
pay my respect to the Holy Mother.

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.600
Whenever I have been here

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:23.520
from Her Holiness I have myself

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.760
learned quite a few things.

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:28.680
Today also there is something more addition to my knowledge

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:33.520
and the tremendous work She is doing

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:37.440
I can not describe in words the marvelous job She has been doing.

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:40.560
And it is our good luck and we are all fortunate

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:44.160
to be guided by Her. She has got infinite wisdom

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:48.240
and I just express my heartliest respects to You, Mother.

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:55.200
And now this is how we have been able to manage that.

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:59.240
Now this place where, where the wedding is going to take place

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:03.080
is called mandap - the auspicious place.

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:06.080
And we are going to kindle the sacred fire

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:09.680
not ordinarily but as commanded

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:12.720
by the revealed books, that is the Vedas.

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:14.720
Vedas means the books of knowledge

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.000
[INAUDIBLE] [HINDI] "is awake"

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:20.440
and they were the revealed books from the Lord

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:24.920
and the sages were inspired by the Lord

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:29.040
and they spoke these [INAUDIBLE] called mantras

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.200
collected in the books we can call the Vedas.

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:33.920
Now we need the sacred fire here.

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.880
In every scripture of every religion

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.880
God has been spoken as a great light -

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:42.320
"jyothi light prakash".

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:45.200
So we need the presence of the holy [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:49.800
to witness the ceremony and they are going to have certain

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.520
pledges and vows at staying together to remain

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:55.800
truthful and honest to each other

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.800
in the presence of something which is bright

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.400
and there can be no better image

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:04.040
of the Lord among all the material objects of

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.360
the world except this bright light.

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:09.240
And for remove the darkness

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:13.640
may the light of God, the light of knowledge and wisdom

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:16.160
remove the darkness of our mind.

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:18.960
Whatever is going to take place outward

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:23.200
it has got something to just explain.

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:27.120
Hidden behind all that outward show is all symbolic.

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:30.040
Outside we have the symbols and behind the symbols there is

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:33.360
something hidden and that is the real ideology,

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:36.960
the real philosophy. And we shall be putting glasses

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:42.480
filled with water here. Water is, water signifies purity,

00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:46.360
it's the symbol of purification that purifies everything

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:48.640
and it is also symbol of peacefulness.

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:52.360
When we put water in all the four directions

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:55.200
we always aim at the universal peace.

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:57.800
May there be peace all over the universe,

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.880
in all the directions. That is why we put water there.

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:04.920
And flowers are there. Flowers they symbolize

00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:08.040
the freshness and newness of life.

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:10.760
You are going to enter a new life of [UNCLEAR],

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:14.080
so flowers are very very befitting on this

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:17.120
auspicious occasion. And also at the same time,

00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:21.000
just as the sweet fragrance of the flowers spreads around,

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:24.920
pleases everybody, may the good men

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:27.760
of your families from were you come and

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:31.400
your larger family is now the family of the Holy Mother,

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:34.080
that spread like a sweet fragrance of the

00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:36.280
flowers around the universe

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:40.640
and bring peace and wisdom reigning everywhere.

00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:44.000
This is why flowers are there and they are also beautiful.

00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:47.000
Now we have this ghee - clarified butter

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:50.800
that will keep the fire alive there.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.640
And well of course pieces of wood are there. Then we have this

00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:56.920
incense.The idea is just to purify the atmosphere

00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:59.480
and where is havan samagiri? Yes.

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:03.160
The gentleman is holding this havan samagiri

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:06.800
and that one there and these are supposed to

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:13.520
consist of fragrant herbs, dried flowers, some spices,

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:17.640
things like that so that when they're burnt in the sacred fire

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:22.600
then they are consumed by it and they purify the atmosphere around.

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:28.200
This is what the idea is there and then we have (have we got water?)

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:29.320
[UNCLEAR]

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:32.560
Now this is the right side what you call,

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:36.720
is the material side of love, to be purified.

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:41.160
And for that fire is, as we always use fire,

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:44.240
as you know deepa (oil lamp) I know that you use it, in the same way

00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:47.720
it is going to be purified with this fire and the water

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:50.800
as we use to remove that we that, we use water also

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.960
and the flowers. They represent the fragrance of the

00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:57.840
Flowers are the highest in the matter.

00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:00.840
In the same way you are the highest of those who are realized souls.

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:04.800
So what he is saying that this is to be purified and the matter

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.400
should be purified because married life

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:10.040
is the epitome of materialism.

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:12.880
If you cannot have a good married life all your materials

00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:14.920
have no meaning at all, is zero.

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:18.400
And that's why your material side should to be purified,

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:20.800
sanctified, should be auspicious.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:26.520
And that's why these are trying to purify the elements,

00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:30.000
elements which have created our chakras, as you know that.

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:34.120
So elements must be purified and they have to be worshiped

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:39.440
and to be in such a way that all the deities

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:46.440
which are of these elements can be also awakened.

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:49.480
Alright? So this is the purification of the elements,

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:51.480
within us and without. Both.

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:53.480
(INAUDIBLE)

00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:59.320
Vedas did that.

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.880
How it is related to Sahaja Yoga you can see clearly.

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:19.480
Now, Holy Mother (CONTINUES IN HINDI?)

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:24.960
So give them guidance, guidance from the source of our intelligence,

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:28.960
source of all life and existence, the Supreme Lord,

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:32.600
and the Supreme Mother, you can say that,

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:39.440
so we pray as is contained in the Vedas, in the Holy Vedas.

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:46.800
[HINDI]

00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:50.400
Now this is going to be a very important beginning

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:55.600
with madhupark, madhupark is there, mixture of yoghurt and honey.

00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:59.560
Honey is very pureful, very energizing

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:04.000
and when it is mixed with yoghurt it becomes a bit mild and cool.

00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:07.360
And the idea is that the brides here

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:12.000
they will offer their own companions this madhupark,

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:16.600
something sweet expressing the sweet feeling of your heart.

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:18.800
This is called madhupark.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:23.440
And where is that madhupark, please madhupark.

00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:26.560
It's all symbolic, as he said, is all symbolic.

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:28.680
You should go around there to have start.

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:30.920
But this is a circle you can start from anywhere.

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:33.080
Circle has no beginning no end.

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:40.320
So the brides, the bride, every bride in here, take a spoon.

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:43.320
You'll pass the spoon from one couple to the other.

00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:46.000
Hold the spoons, please. No, the bride will hold.

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:48.560
And you say after that you pass

00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:50.680
[UNCLEAR]. First of all you will speak after me.

00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:54.360
I will guide you speak. Every bride. All brides, not bridegrooms.

00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:56.440
You wills say, "Om,

(MOTHER SPEAKS IN HINDI?)

00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:07.600
All the brides should take it from the spoon. Come along.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.160
In the right.

00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:11.240
(HINDI)

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:11.840
They don't have all.

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:12.280
Everybody has a spoon?

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:13.480
No, they don't.

00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:15.160
We need more spoons.

00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:19.760
Sixteen I think. And we can spare one there.

00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:26.480
Sixteen we got. [HINDI]

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.800

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:36.480
All of you take.

00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:48.480
Only keep like that, only on the hands, holding on the hands.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.000
Now.

00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:03.240
All you are going to say

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:07.840
Now all the girls have to say this. And you speak please after this.

00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:09.080
Om,

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:12.320
madhuparko,

00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:15.160
madhuparko,

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:18.120
madhuparkah,

00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:22.560
grihyataam.

00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:26.880
You are saying to your companions,

00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:31.080
"Please accept this madhupark

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:35.360
prepared from yoghurt and honey

00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:38.960
expressing my sweet happiness.

00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:40.280
Please accept it."

00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:40.920
See that...

00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:43.320
And you give it to your companion

00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:46.000
The sense is sweetness of marriage.

00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:49.240
and they will taste it. Give them. Alright. Let them taste.

00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:50.280
Come along.

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:51.640
You taste.

00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:56.160
Because according to Indian marriage

00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:58.840
the place where the ceremony is going to be held,

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:02.160
that belongs to the bride. She comes to wed there.

00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:04.600
And he is given the good welcome.

00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:06.840
So this the welcome you are giving to them because

00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:09.440
he's coming to wed you here. But here you have

00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:11.000
This is the bride's place.

00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:12.200
Bride's place, yes.

00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:15.240
At the moment, for the time being it's the bride's place.

00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:21.800
Now I read the mantra that goes along with that.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.840
OM! Yanmadhuno madhavyam

Roopena-annaadyen paramo. Madha vyonnaadosani.

Sweet is the [UNCLEAR], sweat is the wind,

00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:43.560
our hearts are sweet, let our heavenly Father be sweet to us.

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:50.840
So now you can keep it here with you and you can take it out after.

00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:56.160
Now Mataji, the basis of the marriage ceremony

00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:59.360
that is kanyadaan, giving away

00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:04.760
the hand of the bride's prospective bridegroom.

00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:07.600
Of course Mataji will bless that.

00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:11.040
And we can get about 16 people to do that.

00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:13.000
Now, can 16 people

00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:17.720
Who are acting as the persons who are giving the hand of the bride.

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:19.680
Come 16 please.

00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:29.600
See every parent is there, 16 parents.

Why did you take out your garland?

00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:47.200
Give it to [UNCLEAR] now.

00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:07.400

born in family with the surname Kashyap,

that's the surname of Mataji.

00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:29.240
Kashyap is actually a realized soul, Kashyap.

00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:31.920
Yes, he was a very great saint.

00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:37.560

Your offer has been accepted. You can retire now.

Now we are going to kindle the sacred fire.

00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:51.160
Now ladies and gentlemen,

Very important things are coming ahead now, listen to me.

Now, now let's start from here.

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:08.760
You take this water both of you, in your right hand.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:13.120
Somebody comes and goes around.

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:16.880
Give each of them, both, each of them.

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:21.000
This is the brother. This is the brother of all the brides.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:24.560
Go around and give to each one of them, each one of them water.

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:42.880

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:49.280
Go round.

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:07.760
Just a bit quicker, we have to do it three times.

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:19.200
To make it adjustment Mataji, I have learned the technique from you.

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:23.000
[HINDI]

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:27.400
You have to keep it in such a way that you should take it thrice.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:31.080
Thrice. First time and second time you don't have to [UNCLEAR]

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:51.200
Now I explain to you the significance of sacred water.

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:59.480
As we started this water is purified

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:04.200
and it means peacefulness.

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:07.760
Water means peacefulness and it is purifier.

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:13.200
Now we are starting the ceremony [UNCLEAR] that concern you both.

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:16.160
Now you are going to sip water three times.

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:20.080
It means, "May your hearts be purified toward each other."

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:26.000
So that you have regards and also at the same

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:29.720
time your mind should be free from any tension.

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:33.280
They should be peaceful, at peace, when you are

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:36.640
starting the ceremony and you are going to sip water

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:41.600
meaning, "May God in the form of water purify your hearts

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:45.600
and you remain truthful and honest to each other"

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:48.400
when you are going to take the vows after that. Ok?

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:56.640
Now you are going to

01:02:58.640 --> 01:02:59.880

One third of it.

One, one third of it.

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:06.920
God is our base, this is the idea.

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:08.120
Second time.

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:11.000
[HINDI]

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:14.360
Second time. God is our cover, we take his shelter.

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:15.200
The third.

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:19.720
[HINDI]

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:22.360
Each one of them, each one of you is saying,

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:25.480
"God, give us prosperity,

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:29.960
long life, fame and good health." This is what you are saying.

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:31.040
And Truth, Satya.

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:32.160
And Truth, yes.

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:35.040
And now you are going to have in the

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:37.720
left hand a bit and that will be over.

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:40.200
In the, on the left hand, go around.

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:42.720

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.920
Just a bit quicker. Don't give [VIDEO INTERRUPTION]

Now with these two fingers. Astrologically they are

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:50.600
considered to be better, these ones.

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:53.560
Mean the first one, because that is the accusing one,

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:56.040
don't take that, take that,

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:59.160
the middle one, these one. And now you're going to touch

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:02.760
as I told you. Not do that, you'll start doing when I tell you.

01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:06.240
With water you're going to touch mouth, it means,

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:09.800
"May our speech be purified with water,

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:13.040
so that we do not speak evil words."

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:15.680
And you always speak words of love towards

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:18.480
your companion, ok. That is the idea.

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:23.400
Speech is purified and then you are going to touch nose.

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:27.360
"May you always live in very good environment",

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:31.080
where there is no foul smell, and at the same time,

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:33.240
"May you have no breathing trouble at all."

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:36.560
Because a requirement of a person who starts

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:39.560
a domestic life is perfect physical health.

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:43.080
And then you are touching eyes. "May you always see

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:45.920
good sights, no impure sights,

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:49.960
not to see evil and your eyesight should be perfect."

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:51.040
Should be pure.

01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:51.880
with very long life.

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:55.720
And then, "You should not listen to evil words there.

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.800
Your hearing should be purified."

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.320
At the same time, "May you enjoy the perfect path of hearing."

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:06.040
Then you are touching there. "May your arms be strong

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:09.400
for such [UNCLEAR] for the protection of the needy."

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:10.760
And you are touching there

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:13.640
It means, "May your legs also be strong

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:17.200
so that you always walk upright and nicely"

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:19.400
with no limping, nothing like that.

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:23.000
And then you are throwing water all over the body. It means,

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:25.600
"All the limbs of the body impact at physical health"

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:27.880
as the first requirement

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:31.040
for a house holder which you are going to be. Alright.

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.160
And all of the chakras we can add.

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:35.800
I'm taking a bit so that

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.520
When we touch the chakra and then Nabhi

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:40.240
[UNCLEAR]

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:42.040
Yesterday we didn't thought.

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:43.240
And you do as I do.

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:47.360
These two. This's all symbolic. Behind the symbol as Mataji has said

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:51.280
much lies here. And with these two fingers you can do as I do.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:54.640
OM! VAANGME AASYESTU.

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:58.480

OM! ARISHTAANIME-ANGAANI, TANOOSTANVAA ME SAHSANTU-U-U.

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:21.040
Now we are ready for kindling the sacred fires before us.

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:28.880
[UNCLEAR]

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:38.040
I think who should do now because everybody can't do that.

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:46.280
So should I do it on your behalf, with your permission?

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:50.360
Now I am representing all of you kindling the sacred fires.

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:06.040
And now the man with the havan samagri please comes.

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:09.560
Come here and give them in the hand to keep

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:13.520
a bit of stock in the left hand. Then they have to use it.

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:16.520
To everybody. And when I say "swaha

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:19.760
you are going to put it. Not the whole lot, just a little bit.

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.640
Keep it in your left hand.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.840
In the meantime I kindle the sacred fire to save time.

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:42.880

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:53.880
I'll do it for you this time.

01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:58.320
Now ladies and gentlemen, after every hymn

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:02.480
I say "swaha". The meaning of "swaha".

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:06.680
"Swa aha - what is well said in the hymn

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:09.720
may God accept that prayer

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:14.320
recited by us." This is one meaning. Then "swaha" also means

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:16.680
"welfare of the mankind"

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:21.720
which means in anyway He likes. This is the idea of "swaha"

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:25.320
which you repeat everytime. Welfare of mankind

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:29.880
and self-surrender to the deity and then

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:34.880
what is contained in the hymn, may that be accepted by the Lord.

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:38.160
This is the meaning of the word "swaha". Then it is, again I say,

01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:42.800
"idam Na mam". "Idam" means "this, "Na" means not, "mam".

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.760
"Nothing is mine in this world, everything belongs to God."

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:50.520
Therefore we say,"Nothing is mine, everything God has given to us

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:54.160
belongs ultimately to Him because He is the Creator,

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:58.640
therefore He is the Master." Ok, this is the idea there and now

01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:01.520
after that I'm going to do that for you, on behalf of you.

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:03.960

IDAM AGNAYE JAATAVEDASE IDAM

01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:57.920
It means, "Oh sacred fire, kindle.

01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:02.040
Oh Lord, remove the darkness of my mind", which is ignorance,

01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:07.560
"and give us health, long life and truthfulness,

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:12.480
honesty, give us wealth, cattle wealth, movable property,

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:16.800
immovable property so that we do not misuse that

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.640
but use it for good things, good works."

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:23.920
This is the idea in hand. Than after that

01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:26.840
I will do it for you, we have to do a bit more.

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:33.680

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:49.560
[HINDI]

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:52.880
[HINDI]

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:55.760
[HINDI]

01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:57.560
[HINDI]

01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:00.480
Now these are the names of God,

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:05.360
different names of God. God is One, Reality is One,

01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:08.440
but the Reality is spoken by many names.

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:11.840
[HINDI]

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:17.040
"Truth is One, Reality is One but it is covered by the wise men

01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:20.720
by different names." Ok? Sometimes we called it "shakti",

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:24.360
sometimes you call it "jagadamba", sometimes you call it

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:27.640
"the merciful lord", "the blissful lord",

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:31.480
the "all knowing lord". These are the different names of God.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:34.720
He is the same God. Sometimes he's called "prajapati",

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:37.680
"the sustainer of the universe", "creator of the universe",

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:40.440
he is called "Agni"- the great light,

01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:43.760
he is called "swar" - the great word that

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:48.040
inspired the sages and we have got these Vedas and shruti.

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:52.480
And sometimes he is called this "prana"- the vital breath

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:55.480
which is so nearest to us, on which our lifes depends. He is

01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:58.360
so nearest to us, really the source of our lifes.

01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:01.040
All these are names of One Supreme Reality.

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:05.040
Now after that, Mataji, may I have some mithai sweetnies?

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:08.240
[INDIAN]

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:14.160
Now this is another symbolic gesture,

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:18.160
something sweet representing the

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:22.960
blessings, the sweet blessing [UNCLEAR] that He has given to us.

01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:25.280
So then we take a portion of that,

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:28.000
make the offering in the sacred fire

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:30.760
which is representing the Holy Lord at this time,

01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:33.480
then the idea is, "Oh Lord,

01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:36.480
all these sweet blessings which you have given to me

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:39.560
I offer to you because nothing belongs to me.

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:42.880
You are the Creator, everything belongs to You, nothing is mine."

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:48.240
That is the idea there. So all these you'll have. In the right hand.

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:49.320
Pass it on [UNCLEAR].

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:50.520
Pass it on, yes.

01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:52.560
[UNCLEAR]

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:56.280
Take a bit of this. The other one helps.

01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:01.120
[UNCLEAR]

01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:08.440
[UNCLEAR]

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:12.040
holding in your right hand the sweet. [UNCLEAR]

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:17.400
and when I say "swaha" you [UNCLEAR].

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:20.880
So I read the mantra. And all those who have

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:24.080
having that please throw it in there.

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:27.680
[HINDI]

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:34.520
[HINDI]

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:37.560
[HINDI]

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:41.320
[HINDI]

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:45.200
[HINDI]

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:47.600
[HINDI]

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:50.280
There is also [UNCLEAR]

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:53.640
"If we have missed some part of the ceremony,

01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:57.520
if we have not been able to perform the ceremony perfectly well,

01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:01.440
may God accept it our hearts love

01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:04.880
and ignore our drawbacks or faults." Ok?

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:09.120
Now the next thing that starts

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:15.240
you are going to put this, little bit out of that,

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:18.000
little bit of. Well, I will do with you.

01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:29.120

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.200
[HINDI]

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:10.720
[HINDI]

01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:13.200
[HINDI]

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:18.480
[HINDI]

01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:23.160
[HINDI]

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:28.560
[HINDI]

01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:32.560
[HINDI]

01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:36.360
[HINDI]

01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:38.080
Now "Gayatri mantra",

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:43.560
the great hymn, he is also called as "Guru mantra"

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:46.680
because at the time when the

01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:49.760
disciples went to the guru for education,

01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:53.720
spiritual education or any such like education,

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:57.000
he is taught by the guru, the guide,

01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:00.840
this mantra. This is called "Guru Mantra"

01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:03.800
This is also called as "Gayatri Mantra",

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.560
"gayatri" means the mantra that protects us.

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:09.520
"Gayatri" also means poetical meter

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:11.960
in this mantra has [UNCLEAR].

01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:14.480
And it is also called as "Veda Mata" -

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:18.600
"the mother of the Vedas", it's the most important of that.

01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:21.280
And that protects us like Our Mother

01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:24.520
if we chant it with devotion. It's also called

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:28.640
as "Surya mantra", "Savita mantr" and "Savitri mantra"

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:32.680
[UNCLEAR] power of the Lord. It is a very holy mantra

01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:37.040
and the meaning is, "Om", the meaning of "om" is "our saviour,

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:40.880
our protector" and it is the most sacred name of God.

01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:42.360
[HINDI]

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:46.440
"God is all existence, all pervaiding,

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:51.720
all knowing" and "swaha" - "of blissful nature."

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:54.280
[HINDI]

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:59.760
"And may we meditate on His bright glory and may we always remember

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.440
[UNCLEAR] - the power of the Lord

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:04.560
that burns our sins."

01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:07.280
[HINDI]

01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:13.360
"May our mind and intellect be always inspired with a noble cause."

01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:16.960
This is the mantra, gayatri mantra, so we chant it three times.

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:20.280
[HINDI]

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:23.040

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:26.440

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:31.400

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:37.320

01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:39.840

01:18:56.280 --> 01:19:00.760
[HINDI]

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:04.760
Put all the samagri there, all the samagri there.

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:10.440
All the samagri, all. Just wait, just wait.

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:34.000
You are still holding that.

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:40.600
[UNCLEAR] don't put anymore please.

01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:57.720

01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:01.840
and the real ceremony, the wedding ceremony that should start now.

01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:07.120

Somebody, someone help me by tying one end [VIDEO INTERRUPTION]

01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:45.480
[UNCLEAR]

01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:49.560
The real part of the ceremony

01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:56.680
[VIDEO INTERRUPTION]

01:20:57.200 --> 01:20:59.320
... with the bridegroom, she goes with him.

01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:02.440
This has been the custom everywhere.

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:05.600
So you ask after the marriage you will be

01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:08.320
taking her to live with you in your house.

01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:10.880
Mother, I will be [UNCLEAR].

01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:14.240
You have to give assurance to her,

01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:17.800
you have to give assurance to her [UNCLEAR]

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:20.720
You are giving assurance to her,

01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:23.760
"Look, you are going with me as my wife,

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:26.760
you shall be respected in our family,

01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:30.000
you shall be given all hospitality,

01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:33.680
and you are going to protect the house." This is the assurance, ok.

01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:55.960
[HINDI]

01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:59.240

01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:11.320

01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:12.640

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:14.120

01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:15.920
[HINDI]

01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:17.040
[HINDI]

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:19.840
You are saying, each one is saying to each

01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:22.920
your own respective or appropriate friend

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:27.880
you say, "I hold your hand before the sacred fire,

01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:33.240
before this august assembly I assure you, you shall be

01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:36.400
respected in our family and you shall

01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:39.360
be treated as a goddess of [UNCLEAR]".

01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:43.040
And you also repeat, you say, "The most high

01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:46.960
and most merciful God has given you to me

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:50.480
in the presence of this sacred fire, in the presence

01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:53.680
of the Holy Mother , in the presence of whole assembly."

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:58.040
Again you repeat [UNCLEAR] again bridegrooms should do.

01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:01.840
[HINDI]

01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:05.560
[HINDI]

01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:08.840
[HINDI]

01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:10.760
[HINDI]

01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:14.080
[HINDI]

01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:16.920
[HINDI]

01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:19.760
[HINDI]

01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:25.280
Each of you is saying to the appropriate lady here, you say,

01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:30.400
"I repeat I hold your hand. You are very auspicious.

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:34.080
You are my dear wife and I am your husband

01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:37.520
and I shall love you with all my mind, with all my heart."

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:41.320
This is what you have said, you have given her the assurance.

01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:43.600
Now they will stand and they will

01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:45.960
join you. You've saying the pledges.

01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:47.720
[UNCLEAR] [VIDEO INTERRUPTION]

01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:49.720
Ok? Now,

01:23:53.160 --> 01:24:00.040
both of you, and the first of all, this is on behalf of the

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:03.640
bridegrooms again. You will speak after me and you are,

01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:09.640
and you are addressing her. Please after bridegroom you say.

01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:13.600
[HINDI]

01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:17.080
[HINDI]

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:22.160
[HINDI]

01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:25.200
[HINDI]

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:27.240
[HINDI]

01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:31.240
[HINDI]

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:33.720
[HINDI]

01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:40.040
You are telling them, "Please be firm willed and strong minded

01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:44.440
like this solid piece of rock so that nobody

01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:48.720
succeeds in sawing the seed of enmity

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:52.760
and jealousy between us." You have addressed your brides like that.

01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:56.480
And now here I'd like to explain a bit.

01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:02.400
Now you have used the word in this mantra as the "stone".

01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:06.640
Now there are three kinds of significance regarding the stone.

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:13.440
Stone represents solid thing, something very strong.

01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:18.960
Your marriage ceremony is on the foundation of strong stone.

01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:22.920
And it is unshakeable. This is one idea. The other idea is

01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:26.720
stone also represents the obstacles in life

01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:30.480
and you say, "Put your foot on the stone,

01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:34.880
never get defeated, overcome the obstacles of life."

01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:37.400
There are many times difficult times in life,

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:41.800
you have to overcome that, not get defeated, understand?

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.600
The third idea is become strong as I have told you already

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:49.280
so that nobody succeeds in sawing the seed of enmity between you.

01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:53.520
Now here the next time all of you...

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:57.160
Mataji, now they'll be ready to go round.

01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:59.320
Remove that. Now,

01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:06.200
every bride here is saying this prayer

01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:10.320
and these are the beautiful prayers everyone of you is saying.

01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:12.200
The first says,

01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:14.880
[HINDI]

01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:19.400
[HINDI]

01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:21.720
[HINDI]

01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:25.800
The first prayer is the wife says, "May I continue

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:29.240
to receive the love of my husband."

01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:31.880
You need to come around there.

01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:36.720
She says, every wife says, "May I continue

01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:39.120
to receive the love of my husband." Second

01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:42.720
[HINDI]

01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:46.120
[HINDI]

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:50.360
Second prayer is, "May my husband and myself enjoy

01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:52.720
long life and good health." Third,

01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:55.720
[HINDI]

01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:59.360
[HINDI]

01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:04.240
The third is, "May the family of my peers", each one of you say,

01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:08.120
"we have good relations with each other. May we be blessed with

01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:12.960
prosperity and God always guides us

01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:16.200
on the right path." These are the third prayer, ok.

01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:20.040
And you are going to [UNCLEAR]

01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:22.680
you are going to go around the sacred fire.

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:25.080
Please don't go this way, this is the right way.

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:29.680
And the first round, "May God give us the knowledge of Dharma

01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:32.200
and keep us righteous minded."

01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:36.000
And the second one is, "[HINDI] May God give you

01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:38.440
economic prosperity", second round.

01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:42.560
Third round means "[HINDI] happiness, domestic happiness

01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:45.160
with your companions. And the fourth is

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:46.920
"moksha" - God realization.

01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:51.080
These are the things everybody needs to have in the lifetime

01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:54.240
because the wife gives these preachings to the husband.

01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:57.360
Therefore wife will lead in the first round

01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:00.280
the respective husband, she will be ahead

01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:03.920
and husband would be following her.

01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:06.760
And then when I... Don't start yet please.

01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:10.640
So the first round starts and when the first round

01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:14.320
finishes you come and stay in the same position you are now.

01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:16.920
Look, the same position you are now here, ok.

01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:19.680
The first round start, "May God give you right".

01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:22.880
As I was telling you, it is with the cooperation of the wife

01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:26.480
that the man gets dharma, he remains righteous minded

01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:28.640
if she cooperates nicely at home.

01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:33.840
Secondly "[HINDI]". If there is peace at home the husband is able

01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:36.840
to earn money or the wife can also earn money

01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:41.040
wherever they go for work if the peace is kept at home

01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:43.520
because she is the lady of the house,

01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:46.760
therefore it is on account of her cooperation

01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:49.720
that there is economic prosperity in the family.

01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:52.000
Therefore she will lead in the second round also.

01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:55.120
The third "[HINDI]". If the wife cooperates

01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:58.440
there is happiness in the family, much depends on her.

01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:01.680
She is the very important person in the household life

01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:04.960
and therefore she also lead in the third round.

01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:07.760
And in the fourth the husband will lead.

01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:11.640
He gets realization only if the wife

01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:14.480
cooperates in these three ways. And then

01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:17.200
he also leads because wherever he goes

01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:19.680
he will take his wife with him. He will not

01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:22.520
go alone on holidays, he will take her

01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:25.120
with him. She is not only the wife

01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:28.840
but she is also the most intimate and trustworthy friend.

01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:31.840
Therefore he will take her wherever he goes.

01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:34.480
Now the first round will start this way

01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:37.640
and I keep off that side. Please keep off the fire.

01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:42.360
Wherever you are you have to come back
there and stay in the same position.

01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:45.840
[HINDI]

01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:46.560
Walk please.

01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:47.880
[HINDI]

01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:49.280
Walk walk, everbody walks

01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:52.480
so that everybody's able to walk.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.120
[HINDI]

01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:55.920
[HINDI]

01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:57.880
Go around please, full circle,

01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:00.240
full circle, keep moving, keep moving.

01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:03.000
You know when you are standing, you have to come back here.

01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:07.200
[HINDI]

01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:08.200
Go on.

01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:10.440
[HINDI]

01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:12.640
[HINDI]

01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:15.600
[HINDI]

01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:16.720
Keep moving.

01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:20.760
May God gives you the knowledge of dharma.

01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:23.960
May you remain righteous minded.

01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:27.880
Alright, you've, I'll presume you have taken one circle, allright.

01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:30.240
Now second, second. [VIDEO INTERRUPTION]

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:35.680
[HINDI]

01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:37.800
[HINDI]

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.520
[HINDI]

01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:43.320
[HINDI]

01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:46.160
[HINDI]

01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:51.520
[HINDI]

01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:54.440
Again move, the second round. "May God give you",

01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:56.560
each one of you "economic prosperity."

01:30:56.760 --> 01:31:01.920
[HINDI]

01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:05.960
[HINDI]

01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:06.800
Keep going.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.600
[HINDI]

01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:11.720
[HINDI]

01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:14.080
[HINDI]

01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:17.080
[HINDI]

01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:20.680
I take it for granted you have done the second round.

01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:25.600
Now the same three prayers the wife she is repeating there.

01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:27.840
[HINDI]

01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:31.320
[HINDI]

01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:36.600
[HINDI]

01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:39.520
[HINDI]

01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:42.880
[HINDI]

01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:47.760
[HINDI]

01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:50.600
Third round, "May God give you happiness, domestic happiness."

01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:51.800
Move on please.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.400
[HINDI]

01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:56.760
[HINDI]

01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:58.960
[HINDI]

01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:00.800
[HINDI]

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.040
[HINDI]

01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:04.920
[HINDI]

01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:06.680
[HINDI]

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:09.840
[HINDI]

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:12.640
Third round has been taken.

01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:18.520
And now the last round. Now the husband now will be leading.

01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:25.960
So the husband please, husband, come before your companion.

01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:32.880
The husband should come, husband should come before.

01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:34.680
Now the last round.

01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:35.520
This is collectivity.

01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:41.280
And this is, "May God give you God realization"

01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:44.400
with the cooperation of your wife of course

01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:47.520
and so (slowly) and wherever the husband goes

01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:52.440
he takes the wife with him. He hides no secrets from her

01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:58.160
because she is most trustably worthly, a sacred companion

01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:02.800
and very intimate friend and you have to just take her

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:07.080
into everyone's hands and you to trust each other.

01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:09.720
This is the fourth round. Responsibility on the

01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:12.240
shoulders of the husband is very very great here.

01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:17.120
Realize that and move on while husband moves on this round.

01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:22.640
[HINDI]

01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:26.400
[HINDI]

01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:29.600
[HINDI]

01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:34.080
[HINDI]

01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:37.680
[HINDI]

01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:41.440
Now the very important part of the ceremony is coming

01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:44.400
and after that most of the ceremony would be over.

01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:47.560
[UNCLEAR] two minutes after, nothing more.

01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:51.160
Now the most important which is Mataji also spoke that word there,

01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:52.640
that is "saptapadi".

01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:56.560
You're going to walk seven steps together with your companions there

01:33:56.760 --> 01:34:03.080
Now when you walk harmoniously before people outside

01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:06.400
it is very impressive. You walk in harmony,

01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:09.600
in peace, in a friendly way

01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:13.400
that gives you the lesson here, an instruction here

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:18.160
that in your domestic life also you have to act harmoniously.

01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:23.200
Just as outside walking harmoniously is

01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:27.160
impressive, in domestic life work in harmony,

01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:30.680
learn the lesson adjustment and accomodation.

01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:34.320
You are not going to force your will, none of you, on each other,

01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:38.560
but adjusting each other, accomodating each other,

01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:43.560
not forcing your will but adjusting in a cooperative way,

01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:48.840
that is life, if life is such harmoniously just taken

01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:51.040
in the family, in the household

01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:53.480
that is just like life in the paradise.

01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:57.640
Otherwise that becomes the reverse of that which, God forbids,

01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:01.000
never comes in anybody's life. So you please

01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:03.760
are going to walk 7 steps together.

01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:08.120
But how to, now how to [UNCLEAR] ok.

01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:14.080
The first step, and listen to the significance of the first step,

01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:17.480
and take the first step, stop it and wait for the second step now.

01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:19.720
And with your companions, hold her hand

01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:21.640
together, hold her hand together now

01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:25.680
so that you know who is your wife, hold her hand.

01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:28.800
So you are walking with them together

01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:33.080
in harmony the first step and wait to

01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:35.400
to understand the meaning of that.

01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:40.000
[HINDI]

01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:44.840
[HINDI]

01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:48.280
Take the first step please, first step, stop here.

01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:49.720
The first step meant,

01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:56.800
"We take the first step towards unadulterated food, pure food."

01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:59.320
Because on the supply of pure food

01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:02.320
depends one's health and it is very important.

01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:04.360
And so the second now, take the second.

01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:06.560
[HINDI]

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:10.840
Second step towards strength. "May you be powerful and strong."

01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:12.080
And third please.

01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:15.800
[HINDI]

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:19.080
Take the third step towards wealth and prosperity.

01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:24.880
Wait for the fourth please.

01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:37.360
Yes, now fourth.

01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:39.680
[HINDI]

01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:42.200
Take the fourth step towards happiness.

01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:44.400
Take the fourth step towards happiness, move on.

01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:47.560
Now, waith for the fifth. Fifth.

01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:51.120
[HINDI]

01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:55.000
Take the fifth step towards children. "May God bless you

01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:57.800
with children with nobility of mind and long life

01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:00.760
so that the continuity of the family

01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:03.240
goes on and on." So take the fifth step.

01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:05.320
Have you taken the fifth step please?

01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:08.480
And now wait for the sixth one.

01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:11.080
[HINDI]

01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:14.320
Take the sixth step towards self-respect. You have to be

01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:17.000
with self-esteem many times in your family life,

01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:19.920
and also best health throughout the season.

01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:23.120
You have taken the sixth step. Now the last step please,

01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:25.920
and then what will happen in last step please,

01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:30.640
please listen. In the last step

01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:34.240
now when we started the ceremony you remember

01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:38.760
the wife was to the right of the husband.

01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:41.000
Now she is going to be to the left of the

01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:44.800
husband. You're going to change after seventh step has been taken.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.280
Now seventh step is coming, very important.

01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:49.720
[HINDI]

01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:54.240
Take the seventh step towards stable companionship.

01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:57.800
"May your marriage be stable, unbreakable."

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.240
Seventh you've taken. Now the husband

01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:03.360
to go to the right of the wife, wife to come

01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:06.200
to the lef of the husband. Change the position.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:16.920
We can now, sit now. You can sit now. Please take your seat now.

01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:22.320
Still more enjoyable.

01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:30.480
Now after that I tell you

01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:37.320
why the wife after the marriage remains to the left of the husband.

01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:43.640
Not that she is inferior in any way or she is a junior partner, no.

01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:49.840
Now every wife now will know she is near the heart of her husband.

01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:52.360
That is the idea there. After the

01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:54.800
marriage in the heart of the husband

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:59.400
there should be only the "pratima" or "murti" of the wife

01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:02.120
who is the trustworthy friend and she

01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:04.240
is near that, she has occupied her

01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:06.640
appropriate place which is the place of wife

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:08.680
to remain to the left to the husband near to the heart.

01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:11.480
And that is now according to

01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:16.000
our Dharma Shastra the ceremony is valid now

01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:18.760
when you have walked the seven steps together.

01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:22.440
Now after that I am going to put the auspicious mark

01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:25.760
on their forehead.

01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:37.680
[HINDI]

01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:39.600
Give them sweet, give them some.

01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:41.760
Yes yes. What are you holding there, see.

01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:43.920
Is that? Yes, thank you very much.

01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:47.080
Now, alright I start from here.

01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:50.720
Circle we have that wanting in a circle you can start from anywhere.

01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:51.920
Yes please.

01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:56.520
So I start from the right. Where is the husband now?

01:39:56.920 --> 01:39:59.760
[HINDI]

01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:01.160
You put it on her

01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:08.920
and take, draw the line, take it above. Take more color.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.960
Yes please [UNCLEAR].

01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:22.680
[HINDI]

01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:30.760
And also the line there, deep line.

01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:32.200
On the Sahasrara.

01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:35.440
She is now, everyone of you, is now putting the

01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:37.920
red color on the line on the head.

01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:41.960
You are saturating the companion with your love.

01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:44.560
So this is the color of affectionate love.

01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:47.040
[MOTHER SPEAKS IN HINDI]

01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:50.920
Yes, here [UNCLEAR] now listen to Mataji to what She say.

01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:54.640
That is the realization, that is why we put the color.

01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:32.200
Pass it over, little little to everybody,

01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:34.760
little, you have to give them

01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:37.520

[UNCLEAR] what you have to do. You should not be stubborn

02:03:56.600 --> 02:04:01.080
[UNCLEAR]

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:06.080
And not feel bitter at any point. Just try to be sweet.

02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:10.200
In the beginning especially when you...

02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:14.000
And don't go on demanding.

02:04:14.400 --> 02:04:17.400
Sometimes we feel we have a wife or a husband who

02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:23.960
it's a office of demand, it's not giving. Alright?

02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:27.480
Must learn to give and give and give,

02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:30.320
all the time. Enjoy the giving part.

02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:35.560
Now where is the knife? Can we get the knife?

02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:36.960
There is one coming, Mother.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Alright.

02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:53.640
Sixteen is a very auspicious number, you know. Sixteen plexuses.

02:04:53.840 --> 02:04:56.560
Is for the Virata, for the collective.

02:04:57.520 --> 02:05:00.560
Now I hope collectively all of you who are married today

02:05:00.760 --> 02:05:03.360
will try to make your married life extremely

02:05:03.560 --> 02:05:06.320
successful and an example for others.

02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:14.960
Try to be sweet, nice to each other. Be kind.

02:05:18.960 --> 02:05:22.040
Actually you should enjoy. That's the thing you don't know.

02:05:22.240 --> 02:05:24.120
Must learn to enjoy.

02:05:25.800 --> 02:05:28.560
Everybody is looking so beautiful.

02:05:28.760 --> 02:05:30.480
Only thing you must learn to enjoy.

02:05:30.680 --> 02:05:32.840
And put your ego on one side first of all.

02:05:34.120 --> 02:05:39.640
All the egos are the things that stop your enjoyment, absolutely.

02:05:40.040 --> 02:05:43.920
It's the ego that stops your enjoyment. Finish it off.

02:05:44.240 --> 02:05:45.880
Tell him not to come in between

02:05:46.080 --> 02:05:48.360
because he will just spoil everything.

02:05:49.720 --> 02:05:51.640
He tells you, "Don’t do this otherwise

02:05:51.840 --> 02:05:53.960
you see she should take advantage of you."

02:05:54.480 --> 02:05:58.600
Or she, if she is sitting "she'll take advantage."

02:05:58.800 --> 02:06:00.600
No reservations in marriage between

02:06:00.800 --> 02:06:02.520
husband and wife, no secrets, nothing.

02:06:02.720 --> 02:06:04.400
Just be kind.

02:06:04.600 --> 02:06:07.280
And you should not say something that is not to be said.

02:06:07.480 --> 02:06:10.840
For example one of the keys aspects, about your past life.

02:06:11.560 --> 02:06:13.840
Never talk. Forget it, it's over now.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:18.480
That's something very wrong, talk of the past life

02:06:18.680 --> 02:06:20.920
and to be very confessing. There's no need.

02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:27.000
Talk of something nice. What you are going to do, what you are going

02:06:27.200 --> 02:06:28.800
to achieve and you are going to have.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:32.600
And enjoy. Not of your past life, it's over, forget it.

02:06:33.320 --> 02:06:36.200
Alright? Be kind to each other. Be nice to each other.

02:06:36.400 --> 02:06:39.880
Enjoy is the point. Those who enjoy the most their married life

02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:44.520
are nearest to my heart. But they should be in Sahaja Yoga.

02:06:44.720 --> 02:06:50.040
Those who enjoy married life without Sahaja Yoga are stupid.

02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:05.920
Alright, so here I have to cut for the bride [UNCLEAR]

02:07:06.440 --> 02:07:09.240
All of you, I'm cutting down here, alright?

02:07:09.440 --> 02:07:12.280
May God bless you all. May God bless you all.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:23.880
Now somebody (now you can take it there)

02:07:24.080 --> 02:07:25.280
Now somebody who is an expert

02:07:25.480 --> 02:07:31.000
[UNCLEAR] I don't know

02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:34.000
Anybodiy who sings you can do it.

02:07:35.600 --> 02:07:39.480
John. David.

02:07:39.680 --> 02:07:43.640
Alright, David you can offer [UNCLEAR]

02:07:53.400 --> 02:07:58.040
Light all of them. [UNCLEAR]

02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:27.600
Now what song you sing for a happy married life?

02:08:31.080 --> 02:08:34.000
Happy marriage to you, happy marriage

02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:37.440
dear people, happy marriage to you.

02:08:51.720 --> 02:08:57.360
to you, happy marriage to you,

02:08:57.640 --> 02:09:01.400
happy marriage dear people,

02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:05.840
happy marriage to you.

02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:20.000
Blowing out, we're going to have these blown out.

02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:26.480
And the blowing now, who is supposed to blow it, Me?

02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:27.520
Yes, Mother.
