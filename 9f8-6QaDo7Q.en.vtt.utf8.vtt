00:03:22.208 --> 00:03:26.917
Today we all have assembled here

00:03:32.542 --> 00:03:41.417
to pay our respect to Shri Ganesha.

00:03:49.583 --> 00:03:54.458
Ganapatipule has a special significance

00:04:01.083 --> 00:04:06.583
because He is Mahaganesha.

00:04:09.458 --> 00:04:12.583
The Ganesha at Mooladhara

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
becomes Mahaganesha

00:04:18.208 --> 00:04:21.375
in the Virata, that is the brain.

00:04:23.625 --> 00:04:28.291
That means it is the seat of Shri Ganesha.

00:04:29.834 --> 00:04:33.375
That means Shri Ganesha governs

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:44.000
from that seat the principle of innocence.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.625
As you know very well it is placed at the back

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.834
in the region of optic thalamus,

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:04.375
optic lobe as they call it,

00:05:08.125 --> 00:05:18.959
and it is the giver of innocence to the eyes.

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:29.000
When He incarnated as Christ

00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:34.834
which is in here in the front, at Agnya

00:05:36.083 --> 00:05:39.333
He said very clearly that

00:05:39.333 --> 00:05:43.333
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

00:05:45.834 --> 00:05:48.583
It's a very subtle saying,

00:05:49.458 --> 00:05:52.000
which people don't understand

00:05:53.041 --> 00:05:56.750
what is the meaning of the word "adultery."

00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:03.583
"Adultery" means "impurity" in a general word.

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:10.041
Any impurity in the eye "thou shalt not have"

00:06:10.834 --> 00:06:13.750
it's very difficult.

00:06:14.125 --> 00:06:17.458
Instead of saying that you get your realization

00:06:17.458 --> 00:06:20.125
and clear your back Agnya,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.834
He has said it in a very short form,

00:06:23.125 --> 00:06:26.375
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

00:06:27.333 --> 00:06:31.917
And people thought, it's an impossible situation.

00:06:33.083 --> 00:06:35.750
Because He was not allowed to live long;

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.542
actually His public life is limited

00:06:38.542 --> 00:06:40.792
to three-and-a-half years only.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:49.458
So whatever He has said has a very great significance,

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.583
that your eyes should not be adulterous.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.625
When there is innocence there is no adultery:

00:07:00.125 --> 00:07:03.125
it means there's no impurity.

00:07:03.917 --> 00:07:06.000
For example, with our eyes

00:07:06.375 --> 00:07:14.125
we see something and we want to possess it.

00:07:15.125 --> 00:07:17.458
We start thinking.

00:07:18.333 --> 00:07:20.959
The thought starts

00:07:22.166 --> 00:07:24.959
like a chain, one after another.

00:07:25.458 --> 00:07:37.625
And then we get into the web of horrible thoughts,

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.625
and then we become slaves of those thoughts.

00:07:43.125 --> 00:07:45.250
Without even our knowledge,

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.709
our eyes are turned to things

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.583
which are very gross

00:07:53.583 --> 00:07:56.000
and take you downward.

00:08:01.333 --> 00:08:05.583
As Shri Krishna has said that the Tree of Awareness

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:10.625
grows upside-down,

00:08:11.125 --> 00:08:17.166
that the roots are in the brain

00:08:17.625 --> 00:08:20.625
and the branches grow downward.

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:23.000
Those who have gone towards materialism

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.125
have grown downward.

00:08:25.542 --> 00:08:29.917
Those who have gone towards Divine

00:08:29.917 --> 00:08:33.083
have grown upwards, towards the roots.

00:08:34.583 --> 00:08:37.792
The main root, as they call the taproot,

00:08:38.041 --> 00:08:45.667
the main root is innocence, is Shri Ganesha.

00:08:46.333 --> 00:08:51.333
And He becomes Mahaganesha in Ganapatipule.

00:08:52.999 --> 00:08:57.250
Here He's surrounded

00:08:58.083 --> 00:09:01.458
by the Father Principle, the Guru Principle

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:14.875
of the sea, the ocean - the Indian Ocean.

00:09:20.667 --> 00:09:27.792
That is, here He becomes a Guru.

00:09:30.583 --> 00:09:32.750
When a Sahaja yogi

00:09:33.625 --> 00:09:36.250
establishes his Shri Ganesha Principle,

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.458
he's still a child.

00:09:42.542 --> 00:09:48.667
Of course his eyes start becoming purer and purer,

00:09:49.208 --> 00:09:52.917
and powerful and glistening.

00:09:54.625 --> 00:09:59.166
You must have seen when the kundalini gives you

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.417
the realization

00:10:02.709 --> 00:10:09.083
then your eyes start gleaming,

00:10:09.583 --> 00:10:11.917
like a spark is there in the eyes,

00:10:12.125 --> 00:10:14.917
you can make out a spark.

00:10:16.875 --> 00:10:19.542
With ego it gets covered,

00:10:24.291 --> 00:10:33.083
with ego it blinds.

00:10:34.417 --> 00:10:39.917
With superego it is covered with tears.

00:10:43.125 --> 00:10:45.583
But when they are clear

00:10:46.083 --> 00:10:50.000
you see the beauty of the eyes,

00:10:55.458 --> 00:11:00.583
Shri Ganesha shining through your glances.

00:11:08.583 --> 00:11:11.875
The attention now starts flowing

00:11:12.125 --> 00:11:15.500
through the window of Shri Ganesha's temple.

00:11:19.208 --> 00:11:21.875
But when you mature,

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:29.291
you become Mahaganesha.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:33.667
Then Mahaganesha is established in you

00:11:34.166 --> 00:11:37.917
and you become a satguru,

00:11:38.875 --> 00:11:43.417
you become a divine guru, you can teach others.

00:11:46.125 --> 00:11:48.917
Even a child could be that

00:11:49.625 --> 00:11:53.000
even a grown-up person may be stupid.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:12:01.792
It has nothing to do with age, color, creed or caste.

00:12:02.291 --> 00:12:07.959
It is a state to which one can reach at any time.

00:12:08.333 --> 00:12:11.458
Like we can say here we had Gyaneshwara,

00:12:11.709 --> 00:12:13.959
who at a very young age

00:12:18.041 --> 00:12:22.750
composed the great Gyaneshwari.

00:12:24.959 --> 00:12:26.417
As you have seen yesterday,

00:12:26.709 --> 00:12:29.375
at the age of twelve years Gorakhnath

00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:34.000
established his Mahaganesha.

00:12:39.041 --> 00:12:43.250
But if you do not try to ascend,

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:45.458
then you'll remain at the same stage

00:12:45.458 --> 00:12:47.583
even when you grow old.

00:12:48.834 --> 00:12:52.625
So maturity is the indication.

00:12:53.375 --> 00:12:56.500
Here, as we see in Ganapatipule,

00:12:56.834 --> 00:13:02.917
Shri Ganesha is in its complete, matured form

00:13:07.333 --> 00:13:11.917
so that we develop also our Mahaganesha

00:13:11.917 --> 00:13:13.583
within ourselves,

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:24.500
and our eyes become pure, powerful and divine.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.625
With proper working out,

00:13:36.458 --> 00:13:45.333
I am sure we can establish that state within ourselves.

00:13:49.083 --> 00:13:54.417
Today we came to Ganapatipule, it has a great significance,

00:13:54.999 --> 00:13:56.542
among the Asthavinayaka (eight Swayambhus of Shri Ganesha),

00:13:57.083 --> 00:14:00.041
It is the place of Mahaganesha.

00:14:02.083 --> 00:14:07.583
Mahaganesha is Pithadhish (Governor of all pithas)

00:14:09.959 --> 00:14:12.000
and sitting on this pitha,

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:18.166
he protects all the Ganesha Swayambhus.

00:14:20.375 --> 00:14:22.875
He has the knowledge of all the Omkaras,

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:28.999
as he has attained the Guru Tatwa (Guru Principle).

00:14:31.208 --> 00:14:34.709
If we see in the surroundings,

00:14:35.625 --> 00:14:37.709
the ocean, so beautiful and clean

00:14:38.583 --> 00:14:41.250
is washing the feet of this Ganapati,

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:51.417
because the ocean represents the Guru Tatwa,

00:14:52.583 --> 00:14:57.750
and with that Guru Tatwa, he washes the feet of Shri Ganesha

00:15:00.999 --> 00:15:04.792
that is how it should happen with all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:15:06.166 --> 00:15:08.959
Ganesha Stuthi is done and then Shri Ganesha is established

00:15:09.709 --> 00:15:13.583
and thereafter with the Mahalaxmi Tatwa

00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:19.417
you have to become Mahaganeshas.

00:15:22.208 --> 00:15:25.875
This state can be achieved by children small and big,

00:15:26.792 --> 00:15:30.709
elderly people, ladies and everyone,

00:15:31.542 --> 00:15:38.125
if they can attain the straight forward behaviour,

00:15:39.208 --> 00:15:44.041
which we call as   Saralya  in Marathi, or they say Abhodita

00:15:44.667 --> 00:15:50.458
or innocence, when it is once imbibed in us,

00:15:51.834 --> 00:15:53.959
we can achieve the Guru Principle.

00:15:54.375 --> 00:15:59.291
Whichever Guru, who does not have this straight forward nature

00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:02.166
and innocence, he can never be a Guru,

00:16:02.375 --> 00:16:03.500
he is a Aguru (false Guru).

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.959
The person, whose attention is always on the Divine Power,

00:16:08.959 --> 00:16:10.959
only he can become a real Guru.

00:16:14.625 --> 00:16:17.959
The attention of normal human beings is perverted,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.166
it is not clean. For this Christ has said,

00:16:23.625 --> 00:16:27.333
there should be no adultery in your eyes,

00:16:27.875 --> 00:16:32.583
means that if we put our attention on something,

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:37.208
we start thinking a lot and strange thoughts come to our mind,

00:16:37.583 --> 00:16:39.208
as to how I can acquire this thing

00:16:39.458 --> 00:16:40.959
and why I did not get this thing,

00:16:41.166 --> 00:16:42.583
and other thoughts as to why and why not.

00:16:43.166 --> 00:16:45.709
If we see something and start thinking, then

00:16:46.291 --> 00:16:50.458
you have not yet crossed the Agnya Chakra.

00:16:51.999 --> 00:16:53.834
Whatever object you see, you should become thoughtless,

00:16:53.999 --> 00:17:00.041
especially in the heavenly abode of wealth and prosperity

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:05.041
there are numerous Gods and Goddesses

00:17:05.291 --> 00:17:07.458
at least by seeing them, one should become thoughtless.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:08.917
Once we attain the state of thoughtless awareness,

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:11.166
no perversion will remain in our attention any more.

00:17:11.291 --> 00:17:13.750
The thoughts perverting the mind will not come anymore,

00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:15.999
so how will perversion influence you.

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:19.875
That means like Christ said,

00:17:19.959 --> 00:17:22.542
thou shall not have adulterous eyes.

00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:26.083
They should be so pure, like the rays of the sun,

00:17:26.458 --> 00:17:31.875
when they fall on trees, they do no absorb the dirt,

00:17:32.625 --> 00:17:37.250
they nourish and nurture them, not only that

00:17:37.667 --> 00:17:40.000
but they also give them strength.

00:17:40.709 --> 00:17:43.250
In a similar way,

00:17:43.542 --> 00:17:47.542
the Sahaja Yogis should have such radiance in their eyes, that

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:56.125
they can create a very pure atmosphere in the whole world.

00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:00.917
Purity in the atmosphere is what we need today, everywhere,

00:18:01.917 --> 00:18:10.458
so that peace, joy and divine power can prevail in this world.

00:18:14.083 --> 00:18:18.000
Only singing the praise of Shri Ganesha may not be sufficient,

00:18:18.208 --> 00:18:20.208
Shri Ganesha needs to be awakened within us

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.083
and he should evolve to the state of Mahaganesha.

00:18:23.667 --> 00:18:25.917
Only after attaining the state of Mahaganesha,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.834
can our country benefit and also through our country,

00:18:29.999 --> 00:18:32.000
other countries can benefit from this state.

00:18:32.125 --> 00:18:34.333
We are going to lead the others,

00:18:34.417 --> 00:18:39.750
but if we do not take up this responsibility,

00:18:40.208 --> 00:18:43.917
then I cannot say, what will happen of this whole world.

00:18:44.375 --> 00:18:47.208
I have a request to you all,

00:18:47.458 --> 00:18:50.291
to remove all the adultery in your eyes.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:55.709
For this we have the mantra of Nirvichara in Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:56.125 --> 00:18:57.709
Do not allow the thoughts to dominate you,

00:18:57.792 --> 00:18:59.750
if thoughts come, then say

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:04.375
  Yen Neti Neti Vachane  (it doesn't exist)

00:19:04.875 --> 00:19:07.417
or say   Kshama Keli, Kshama Keli   (I forgive, I forgive),

00:19:07.875 --> 00:19:09.333
so that this thought is destroyed

00:19:09.417 --> 00:19:11.083
and once thoughtlessness is attained,

00:19:12.625 --> 00:19:16.834
then the perversion of the mind stops.

00:19:17.041 --> 00:19:19.500
Everybody should make an attempt,

00:19:19.709 --> 00:19:22.250
that your eyes are not adulterous.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.999
 "If there is perversion in the mind because of my eyes,

00:19:25.125 --> 00:19:29.333
then I do not want to have such eyes ", said Saint Tukaram,

00:19:29.583 --> 00:19:32.667
 "then, it is better to be blind ".

00:19:32.917 --> 00:19:38.166
In one way, it is better being blind,

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:40.208
than have perversion in the mind.

00:19:40.333 --> 00:19:42.834
Rather have inner eyes to see Divinity.

00:19:42.875 --> 00:19:45.166
When these two principles come together properly,

00:19:45.709 --> 00:19:48.542
then one can say that

00:19:48.792 --> 00:19:50.959
the Sahaja Yogi has attained the Guru Principle.

00:19:51.875 --> 00:19:57.375
I bless you all, that here at Ganapatipule,

00:19:57.625 --> 00:20:01.875
the place of Mahaganesha, with his special grace,

00:20:02.291 --> 00:20:05.458
you all can attain your Guru Principle as soon as possible.

00:34:49.417 --> 00:34:55.583
First they will take the twenty-four names of Shri Vishnu,

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.583
so that this Sushumna Nadi will open out.

00:35:00.917 --> 00:35:03.125
Then they will say the Shri Sukta,

00:35:03.417 --> 00:35:07.333
is the one to awaken the energy within you.

00:35:07.667 --> 00:35:14.125
Then they will say the 108 name of Mother Gauri.

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:20.208
After that pujan, when this puja is over,

00:35:20.458 --> 00:35:23.667
then we will be doing a

00:35:31.792 --> 00:35:35.166
Eleven kundas we have got,

00:35:35.583 --> 00:35:41.917
and we'll be doing the havana on eleven kundas.

00:35:42.417 --> 00:35:47.583
Because the Mahaganesha is the ruler,

00:35:48.125 --> 00:35:52.542
is the ruler of Ekadesha Rudra.

00:35:53.041 --> 00:35:55.250
So that has to be done with great devotion

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:56.834
and dedication.

00:35:57.208 --> 00:36:00.875
I would suggest that first is finished this puja,

00:36:01.208 --> 00:36:02.875
you can have your food,

00:36:03.125 --> 00:36:07.333
and afterwards we'll sit down for the havan.
