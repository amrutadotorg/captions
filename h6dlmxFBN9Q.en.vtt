WEBVTT

00:41.790 --> 00:48.070
This will be the fifth puja in Australia,
and I thought that this is the land of Ganesha,

00:48.070 --> 00:53.640
we should have the Ganesha Puja. Is very important
also, very helpful. We all should have Ganesha

00:53.640 --> 01:00.640
Puja, it’s very important. And so today
there will be Shri Ganesha Puja. Have you

01:01.700 --> 01:06.200
got the hundred and eight names of Shri Ganesha?

01:44.780 --> 01:51.780
So we have now requested John Fisher to be
your leader in Canberra. And he has agreed.

02:28.360 --> 02:35.360
I don’t know what to tell you more about
Shri Ganesh, because really it is so important

03:02.889 --> 03:09.889
that we have to know the importance of Mooladhara
Chakra. If you read the newspaper, just on

03:17.700 --> 03:24.700
the first page you find people going amok
as far as their moral sense is concerned,

03:27.730 --> 03:34.730
absolutely I mean, to us it is something so
shocking, and perhaps I think people are possessed

03:38.090 --> 03:45.090
on their Mooladhara Chakra. The way they behave
one feels that there’s something gone wrong

03:47.130 --> 03:54.130
with them completely and they have no control
over themselves; and just like mad people

03:56.079 --> 04:02.489
they are behaving. And all these problems
that are coming, of these perversions, are

04:02.489 --> 04:09.489
due to this kind of a possession on the Mooladhara
Chakra. One has to be very, very careful and

04:12.829 --> 04:19.829
respectful about it. I have already told so
many things how to keep it clean, how to respect

04:21.250 --> 04:25.440
it and how to behave yourself.

04:25.440 --> 04:32.440
As you know, Shri Ganesha was created
at the gate of hell to protect us from falling
into hell. But actually when we insult Him

04:43.800 --> 04:50.800
and we do not care for Him, He just sleeps
off. When that happens, any kind of a possession

04:57.229 --> 05:04.229
can come and can really make people mad. When
you come from India to these places you are

05:08.960 --> 05:15.840
really surprised and shocked. What is wrong
with these people, how can they be behaving

05:15.840 --> 05:22.840
in this manner? How can they go all out to
ruin themselves like this? And how is it they

05:24.780 --> 05:31.780
do not understand the importance of morality
when they are following Christ? The Christians,

05:33.290 --> 05:40.290
I think, are the worst as far as morality
is concerned. They have no moral values left

05:40.370 --> 05:47.370
in them. It’s such a sad thing that the
number of people killed by Christians is also

05:47.380 --> 05:54.380
the maximum. Sometimes I think these people
who were killed everywhere might have possessed

05:55.230 --> 06:02.230
the Christians this way, that they are just
going amok and behaving in this manner, destroying

06:02.350 --> 06:03.100
themselves.

06:03.100 --> 06:10.100
Now the first quality of Shri Ganesha is that
He gives us wisdom. And that wisdom gives

06:15.120 --> 06:22.120
us the sense how to behave, gives us the balance,
and gives us the sense how to behave towards

06:22.750 --> 06:29.750
ourselves, how to preserve yourself, how to
respect yourself. But if Ganesha is not at

06:36.060 --> 06:43.060
all there to watch you, might be from hell
some horrible hellish bhoots are coming out,

06:44.520 --> 06:50.820
or I don’t know, I cannot explain this kind
of a thing. But the other way round, I’ll

06:50.820 --> 06:57.090
tell you, in India, is specially with women,
they are extremely particular about their

06:57.090 --> 06:59.920
chastity, extremely particular.

06:59.920 --> 07:06.920
Like we had a queen called Padmini, and she
was a very beautiful woman. And one Muslim

07:11.660 --> 07:18.660
aggressor who became sultan heard about her
beauty. So he wanted to see her. So she refused,

07:21.170 --> 07:28.170
“I don’t want to see him.” Even seeing
a woman like that: those bad eyes, are bad;

07:29.760 --> 07:34.230
seeing a woman also, are bad.

07:34.230 --> 07:40.560
So he said, “If you do not allow me to see
her, I’ll invade your country.”

07:40.560 --> 07:46.520
So she agreed that, “All right, he can see
me in a mirror, so at least his bad eyes don’t

07:46.520 --> 07:53.030
fall on me directly.” She agreed to that.
And he saw her in a mirror, and he saw that

07:53.030 --> 08:00.030
it was even more beautiful than he had thought
her to be. So now he wanted to have her. So

08:01.520 --> 08:05.570
physical, so superficial.

08:05.570 --> 08:12.060
And he said, “If you now do not come to
me, I will again attack.”

08:12.060 --> 08:18.690
So they made a plan, “Let us now decide
whether we are going to surrender our queen

08:18.690 --> 08:22.139
or not.” So everybody said, “Nothing doing.
We are not going to surrender.” Because

08:22.139 --> 08:29.139
the chastity of a woman is very important,
and that of a queen, and a queen, who is representative

08:32.570 --> 08:39.570
of all the womanhood should not be sacrificed
like this. They could not bear the idea.

08:40.389 --> 08:47.389
So they said that, “All right, we’ll organize
something and cheat these people.” So they

08:48.000 --> 08:52.839
sent a word, “All right, we are all coming
and the queen is coming too.” And they sent

08:52.839 --> 08:58.950
hundred palanquins. We use palanquins for
ladies in India, covered. And inside every

08:58.950 --> 09:05.950
palanquin there was one warrior sitting with
all the weapons. And there were four carrying

09:06.339 --> 09:12.959
the palanquin, and all these four were also
warriors. So thus they have about five hundred

09:12.959 --> 09:19.959
warriors. It was a small kingdom. So when
they went down, these people were very happy.

09:22.379 --> 09:28.540
“The queen is coming.” and they were all
getting drunk and celebrating it. “The queen

09:28.540 --> 09:31.879
is coming. Queen is coming.” So they were
half drunk also.

09:31.879 --> 09:38.290
They had told these women that, “In case
we win, then we lit a fire and you will know

09:38.290 --> 09:44.980
that we have won. But if you do not see any
thing like that, then be sure that we have

09:44.980 --> 09:47.550
lost the war.”

09:47.550 --> 09:52.910
So the king sat in the front palanquin, and
the rest of them, and they went and attacked

09:52.910 --> 09:58.110
them in the sense that they first entered
inside, and then instead of the queen, the

09:58.110 --> 10:04.209
king came out and they all fought those people.
But they were only five hundred so they could

10:04.209 --> 10:10.069
not be saved, and these people had better
weapons, so they were killed. They did not

10:10.069 --> 10:16.420
lit the fire. Now the women knew that all
of them will be coming. Now they were very

10:16.420 --> 10:21.040
rich sultans, very rich Muslims, and things
like that. But they thought that now their

10:21.040 --> 10:27.809
chastity is in danger, so there was a big
platform and they made a big pyre on that.

10:27.809 --> 10:34.809
And they all entered into it and killed themselves,
before they could enter and touch their body.

10:39.040 --> 10:46.040
So for women specially it is very important
to have a great sense of chastity. And if

10:46.259 --> 10:53.259
they do not have the great sense of chastity,
then they develop all kinds of funny ideas

10:54.449 --> 11:00.660
and mentally they become very imbalanced.
And the children that they have, also become

11:00.660 --> 11:07.660
very funny and you have all these problems
of perverted relations, incest relations.

11:07.699 --> 11:14.529
And today I read a horrible story about a
little girl who suffered with this incest

11:14.529 --> 11:21.529
relationship.
It’s hell that we have created. In hell

11:24.459 --> 11:31.459
what else is going to be? Same thing. There’s
no sanity about it, there’s no wisdom about

11:35.050 --> 11:36.009
it.

11:36.009 --> 11:43.009
So we have to now understand how we have to
build ourselves as Sahaja yogis. Men and women,

11:46.119 --> 11:53.119
all of them, have to go hand in hand, because
the first quality I told is wisdom, but the

11:53.300 --> 12:00.300
essence of Mooladhara is innocence. They are
made of innocence. The power of Ganesha is

12:03.970 --> 12:10.970
innocence. And innocence comes when you do
not destroy it. Actually a child is born innocent,

12:12.100 --> 12:19.100
but if the mother is like that, immediately
the child takes over and if the father is

12:19.550 --> 12:26.550
like that the son takes over. But later on
it has effect, whether it’s mother or father.

12:27.009 --> 12:34.009
The whole society is decadent, is in decadence,
is going down. You can see it so clearly.

12:34.860 --> 12:41.860
Thanks to certain great saints in India who
made the culture of India, it has not come

12:45.170 --> 12:52.170
from any philosophers or any writers or intellectuals,
but it has come to us from the saints who

12:52.429 --> 12:59.429
understood the value of chastity, and who
understood the value of innocence. And they

13:01.730 --> 13:07.329
have built the whole thing in such a manner
that these things never enter into our head.

13:07.329 --> 13:13.720
So we call them as susamskaras, means “good
conditionings”. These good conditionings

13:13.720 --> 13:19.649
are surrounding us so much that this never
enters into our head, all these kind of things

13:19.649 --> 13:25.209
that people are doing here, are mad. When
it doesn’t enter into your head, we can

13:25.209 --> 13:32.209
say that we just do not allow these possessions
to come in. Because if you make preparation

13:38.629 --> 13:45.629
in a way for these possessions to come in,
then the possessions will be there. Like the

13:46.079 --> 13:52.350
way people dress up nowadays, you see, they
look like really witches or bhoots, absolutely.

13:52.350 --> 13:56.509
And such people will be definitely attacked,
because the bhoots think that, “These are

13:56.509 --> 13:57.889
someone like us. Let’s go enter them.”

13:57.889 --> 14:04.569
Also Agnya is not to be covered. I have told
a hundred times, please don’t cover your

14:04.569 --> 14:11.100
Agnya, please clear it down. Don’t cover
your Agnya. If you cover your Agnya, then

14:11.100 --> 14:18.100
you cannot be protected. They enter into your
Agnya and from Agnya they can go up to your

14:19.720 --> 14:26.720
Mooladhara. So you are living in atmosphere
which is very dangerous for saints to live.

14:26.730 --> 14:31.660
Actually that’s why they said the saints
must go to Himalaya. If they could say that

14:31.660 --> 14:38.660
to Indians, I don’t know what should I say
to people who live in such horrible circumstance,

14:40.420 --> 14:46.949
absolutely horrible. I mean, you think about
it, how terrible it is, and how many problems

14:46.949 --> 14:53.949
it gives us; how many people are ruined, how
many children are ruined, how we go amok.

14:56.559 --> 15:03.559
So the first thing is that we should understand
that Ganesha gives us maryadas, limits, it

15:05.399 --> 15:12.399
is innate within us. It’s not imposed on
us, it is innate. A little girl if you see,

15:14.589 --> 15:21.589
she’s shy, she knows how to protect herself.
Even the boys, they are shy and they try to

15:23.649 --> 15:30.649
protect themselves, but that innate innocence
we try to flout, because ego is there. “What’s

15:35.129 --> 15:41.899
wrong?” You tell them anything, “What’s
wrong?” And you do not know how devastating

15:41.899 --> 15:48.899
it is. In London I know of so many parents
telling Me that their children are already

15:49.949 --> 15:56.179
squatting, they have got already children.
At a very young age, about fifteen, sixteen

15:56.179 --> 16:03.179
they have got children. And this is so widespread,
and so shamelessly they discuss. I mean, in

16:10.069 --> 16:15.230
the newspaper if you read, I mean you can’t
imagine why to write all these things in such

16:15.230 --> 16:21.699
details in the newspaper. There’s no need
to write each and every thing in the newspaper.

16:21.699 --> 16:28.699
But basically we are good people. God has
created us good human beings. We are beautiful

16:34.009 --> 16:41.009
people, but this ego and this kind of a stupid
idea that, “What’s wrong?” in doing

16:46.170 --> 16:51.649
anything, coming from ego; people have gone
amok, and when you go amok you get caught

16:51.649 --> 16:57.049
up by these bhoots, and then once you are
caught up by these bhoots, you start behaving

16:57.049 --> 17:04.049
in a manner that no one can explain. “Why
they behave like this?” I just don’t understand.

17:06.199 --> 17:13.199
There was a boy who came with all his hair
not properly done and looking funny and with

17:13.520 --> 17:17.910
all these jattas, as we call them. So I asked
him, “Why do you dress up like this? You

17:17.910 --> 17:19.870
look like a primitive man.”

17:19.870 --> 17:22.400
He said, “I want to be primitive.”

17:22.400 --> 17:28.250
I said, “You cannot. Your brain is modern.
By just making such hair, are you going to

17:28.250 --> 17:32.170
become primitive? You cannot become primitive.”

17:32.170 --> 17:39.170
But just imagine, all these external things
they do. For what? To have an identity. Now

17:40.170 --> 17:47.170
this idea of identity is also is a sign that
you do not have your maryadas. You can do

17:47.610 --> 17:54.200
anything. You can become a punk and all kinds
of things you do. I mean, there are no maryadas.

17:54.200 --> 18:00.960
And that means you are denying Ganesha completely.
Ganesha has created those maryadas innately

18:00.960 --> 18:07.960
within us. Even a prostitute in India, if
she has to take to that profession because

18:09.990 --> 18:14.500
she’s forced into it, maybe she’s been
brought from somewhere or maybe that out of

18:14.500 --> 18:21.500
her big problems she might have been a prostitute;
she will see that her child is saved. She

18:21.710 --> 18:27.350
knows that it’s wrong. But here it is so
bad that we do not know also that it is wrong.

18:27.350 --> 18:33.320
Can you imagine, this is the limit of things,
that you see yourself getting drowned in the

18:33.320 --> 18:39.430
water and you know that you are going to be
killed. Still you are enjoying, “Very nice,

18:39.430 --> 18:45.780
I am going to be killed.” This is the situation
of the wisdom. This is really shocking.

18:45.780 --> 18:51.700
So we have to now understand what are our
maryadas are, how we have to live within our

18:51.700 --> 18:58.270
maryadas, and I’m sure if you really work
out your Shri Ganesha. For that the best is

18:58.270 --> 19:05.270
to meditate. Put yourself on some nice turf,
grass. Sit on that. Put your left hand with

19:10.400 --> 19:17.400
the light, and right hand on the Mother Earth,
and say Atharva Sheersha. If you can remember

19:18.550 --> 19:24.460
it by heart, it’s a very good thing. Otherwise,
you can keep the book and read it, or say

19:24.460 --> 19:29.870
Ganesha’s mantra to begin with. It’s going
to help you very much. It’s going to help

19:29.870 --> 19:36.380
you, your eyes, it’s going to your whole
thing, is going to be very nice. And also

19:36.380 --> 19:43.380
with this kind of a mad Mooladhara, a woman
can become extremely aggressive with her husband.

19:43.750 --> 19:49.360
I mean, she can be a very cruel woman, and
that’s what is happening in America now.

19:49.360 --> 19:53.990
But I can’t understand how women could be
that cruel. I mean, I never used to think

19:53.990 --> 20:00.990
women could be cruel, really. I mean they
could be sly, they could be sort of, doing

20:02.310 --> 20:09.310
some scandal-mongering or some sort of stupid
things like that. But that a woman should

20:11.120 --> 20:17.280
be a cruel woman… when I first read the
history of England I was surprised that there

20:17.280 --> 20:23.040
were some queens who were very cruel, and
also that there were seven queens who were

20:23.040 --> 20:30.040
killed. In India if a king kills even one
queen, he’ll be ousted completely from the

20:30.930 --> 20:37.930
whole country.

20:41.570 --> 20:48.570
So it’s not a something very simple thing.
It’s very serious. For Sahaja yogis very,

21:35.750 --> 21:42.750
very serious. They have to revive their innocence.
They have to revive their maryadas. They have

21:49.910 --> 21:56.910
to delimit themselves. It’s very important.
Otherwise, I would say that, if you have some

21:57.400 --> 22:04.400
wheat spread out everywhere, how can you reach
the heights? You have to put them into some

22:05.460 --> 22:12.460
bags, some maryadas. Only by maryadas you
can rise. Of course the kundalini will help.

22:15.990 --> 22:22.990
Of course Ganesha will help also. But we should
also try to watch ourselves. There should

22:23.150 --> 22:30.150
be introspection, “Are we still in the same
category?” I have told many people that

22:30.360 --> 22:37.360
it is better you walk with your eyes towards
the grass, at only at three feet, because

22:39.010 --> 22:45.350
at three feet you can only see children, flowers
and grounds, not higher than that. Nothing

22:45.350 --> 22:52.350
very beautiful is beyond that I think. Or
raise much higher, so that you just see above

22:52.440 --> 22:59.440
the heads of people, nothing in between. And
our whole style, lifestyle is so funny; I

23:06.190 --> 23:12.360
mean, I just don’t know how to explain it,
but is accepted.

23:12.360 --> 23:19.360
Yesterday there was an Indian, and very seriously
he came and told Me, “I have been committing

23:19.950 --> 23:21.950
one sin, so I must tell you.”

23:21.950 --> 23:28.530
I said, “What?” “In my family nobody
takes beer, but I am taking beer sometimes.”

23:28.530 --> 23:35.530
After that, I didn’t know where to look
and what to say. Very seriously he said, “You

23:36.520 --> 23:43.520
are Mother, so I must confess to You, but
now I will never touch beer.” Imagine. Very

23:45.500 --> 23:50.480
seriously he was talking, and another fellow
came, he has told Me.

23:50.480 --> 23:55.730
I said, “Now you Indians don’t want to
come to this thing. What is it? You are all

23:55.730 --> 23:56.640
making money?”

23:56.640 --> 24:01.210
He said, “We have made a lot of money here
and we don’t want any money.”

24:01.210 --> 24:06.220
But I said, “Then why don’t you come?
You should come and take your, to Sahaja Yoga.

24:06.220 --> 24:06.810
Why not?”

24:06.810 --> 24:12.800
He said, “You see, Mother, mostly the trouble
is…” With very great hesitation, he said

24:12.800 --> 24:18.340
that, “You see, mostly it is not advertised
in Indian papers, and we Indians think that

24:18.340 --> 24:23.720
we are rather of a different species, you
see, how are we going to fit in with these

24:23.720 --> 24:28.370
people because, you see, their ideas are so
different, ours are so different, and how

24:28.370 --> 24:34.080
are we going to fit in with them? It’s very
difficult. But this time I saw some Indians

24:34.080 --> 24:39.920
also and some Indian musicians singing, so
it seems that we can fit into them.”

24:39.920 --> 24:44.230
“Yes,” I said, “They can fit in to you
and you can fit in to them. It’s easy. They

24:44.230 --> 24:45.550
are your style only.”

24:45.550 --> 24:50.180
He said, “We were really enamored how they
were nice, you see, and they were.”

24:50.180 --> 24:55.500
Because they do not consider that these things
are bad or anything. India is like that, you

24:55.500 --> 25:00.570
see. They think you are of a different bottle
and they are of a different bottle. So you

25:00.570 --> 25:06.120
are like that and they are like that. They
cannot be like you and you cannot be like

25:06.120 --> 25:10.370
them, so they think it is a different bottle
you belong to, you see, different category

25:10.370 --> 25:15.790
of people. But they don’t think that you
are bad or good, they don’t pass judgment.

25:15.790 --> 25:22.790
But this is what it is, that we have to understand
that we have gone too far with this madness,

25:23.020 --> 25:24.720
spoiling our Shri Ganesha.

25:24.720 --> 25:31.720
Also Australians have to give a very big lead
in Shri Ganesha’s area because you are sitting

25:33.880 --> 25:40.880
on the soil of Shri Ganesha. To all the Sahaja
yogis, you must show. But, as you know what,

25:42.270 --> 25:48.930
we had horrible experiences so far, and how
people have been dominating and doing all

25:48.930 --> 25:55.930
kinds of nonsensical things, money-wise and
otherwise also morality-wise. So it sometimes

26:00.250 --> 26:07.250
upsets the whole balance of Sahaja Yoga because
it’s all depending on Shri Ganesha; that

26:08.770 --> 26:15.770
means depending on Australians. And Australians
have all the possibility of reaching a great

26:19.150 --> 26:26.150
height in Ganesh principle, because they have
the Mother Earth here sitting down. What else

26:26.850 --> 26:33.120
do they want? You need not take to stupid
American-style things. I mean, if you see

26:33.120 --> 26:38.680
their Hallowe’en, I tell you, you won’t
eat your food for eight days. And if you go

26:38.680 --> 26:45.290
only to Rio, even you do not visit their carnivals,
but even if you see the pictures, you won’t

26:45.290 --> 26:48.910
eat your food for one month, so horrible they
are.

26:48.910 --> 26:55.910
So are we going to follow them, or are we
going to start our own Australian Shri Ganesha’s

26:59.310 --> 27:06.310
special people? Or, this I have to warn you,
and people are all watching all over, all

27:12.040 --> 27:18.710
Sahaja yogis are there; you know that all
over the world we have Sahaja yogis. They’re

27:18.710 --> 27:25.710
watching everyone, and you have to do your
maximum to express your Ganesh principle,

27:26.600 --> 27:31.990
which should be very easy for you. And as
I have told you, that Australia was a part

27:31.990 --> 27:38.990
and parcel of India once upon a time. It has
come down here. So, at least in your films

27:39.150 --> 27:43.890
and all that, you can say they’re dharmic,
they are dharmic. They’re not so bad as

27:43.890 --> 27:50.890
the American films are, but still this idea
of copying the French or the Americans shows

27:53.180 --> 27:59.680
that we have lost our personality. But Shri
Ganesha gives you a personality. He gives

27:59.680 --> 28:05.610
you your personality, because He gives you
maryadas. You see, by maryadas only, you get

28:05.610 --> 28:11.430
your personality. A person is known by his
maryadas. And that’s what has to come within

28:11.430 --> 28:13.780
us, are our maryadas.

28:13.780 --> 28:19.500
So today’s puja is about Shri Ganesha. As
of course you know, He has got four petals

28:19.500 --> 28:24.850
and you know what He is placed in and what
He does and all that, and how He looks after

28:24.850 --> 28:30.650
the chastity of His Mother and all that. But
the main thing is that how we develop Shri

28:30.650 --> 28:37.650
Ganesha within us, how people see us as the
incarnations of innocence on this Earth. I

28:39.910 --> 28:46.910
know it’s very difficult, but imagine Shri
Ganesha sitting on the gate of hell, of excretion,

28:49.850 --> 28:55.960
because He’s just like a lotus, above everything
else, and He makes everything fragrant.

28:55.960 --> 29:02.960
In the same way I expect all of you, the Sahaja
yogis of Australia, to have that beautiful

29:04.210 --> 29:11.210
personality of Shri Ganesha, and that you
emit that fragrance of innocence among all

39:54.550 --> 40:01.550
the Sahaja yogis, and
then among

44:44.140 --> 44:51.140
all

45:30.200 --> 45:37.200
the world.

58:39.240 --> 58:46.240
May God bless you.
