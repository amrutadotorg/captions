00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.520
… by the Divine.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.120
For example, if I know only my head, that is not sufficient.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.720
If I know only my neck, that is not sufficient.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.760
If I know only my legs, that is not sufficient.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.920
But the more I know about myself,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.880
the more dynamic I become,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.160
the more expansive I become.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:41.000
And all the great that existed —

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.920
or all the people who were called as great —

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.360
are great because they lived in many human beings.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.680
I feel that warmth in the atmosphere,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.360
as you are feeling because you know they are not foreigners,

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.080
they are your brothers and sisters.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.560
There are so many stories in Puranas like this, that…

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:27.400
I will not name it, but once two brothers met in a jungle.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.280
But they thought that they were enemies,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.520
and they wanted to fight with each other.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.360
And when they came to blows, they couldn’t hit each other.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.160
Then they took out their arrows — the arrows wouldn’t work.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.520
They were quite surprised at this,

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.840
and when they asked each other, “Who is your mother?”,

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.800
they found out mother was the same.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.840
And then they realized that they were not foreigners neither enemies

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.680
but they were made of the same fibre.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:22.720
What sweetness, what beauty that knowledge has given them!

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.960
And what security of understanding

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.960
that everywhere in the whole world we have brothers and sisters,

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.440
who are on their inner being, on their divine,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.680
and how we are bound together with that love!

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:51.640
When I talk of love, people think that I
am trying to make you weak people —

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.120
because people think those who love are weak.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.240
But the most dynamic power in this world is that of love.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.760
Is the most aggressive power — is that of love.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.720
Even we, when we suffer in love,

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:25.480
it is out of our strength that we suffer and not out of our weakness.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.920
For example, there was a teacher in China

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.600
who used to teach the cocks how to fight.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.960
And the king of that place took his cocks

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.720
to that teacher and told him that
“You please teach them how to fight.”

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.440
After one month, when the king went to take those cocks with him,

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.800
he was surprised that the cocks were just silent, doing nothing.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.600
And he told the teacher that “What have you done to my cocks?

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.280
They are not at all aggressive, they are not doing anything!

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.480
How are they going to fight it out?

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.400
There’s going to be a race,

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.360
there’s going to be an exhibition of their strength,

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.440
and what are we going to do about it?”

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.360
He said, “You just take them.”

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.240
He took those two cocks with him and put them in the arena

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.920
where there were other cocks who had come to fight.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.360
These two cocks were very nicely standing.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.000
All the other cocks started coaxing and torturing.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.600
They were just standing and looking at them.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.160
All the other cocks were surprised at their behaviour

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.840
and thought that they were very powerful.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.960
And they all fled away.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.320
The love that I’m talking about, the divine love,

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.520
makes you not only strong but dynamic.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:22.640
It is the greatest luminous power that we can think of.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:32.760
Only when love is surrounded by gross and is lost in the gross,

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.800
it looks as if it is weak and “under chains”.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:44.920
The time it is released, the dynamic power of love

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.960
can transcend all the evil powers of the world.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.040
When people get their Realization,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.200
automatically the ego drops out — to a great extent, I should say.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.480
Because you say that the vibrations are passing;

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.040
you don’t say that you are giving them.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.440
Because the dropping of the ego

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:31.880
sometimes it happens that you feel

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.240
that whatever you wanted to have you have got it

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.600
and you better not talk about it.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.480
When there is any opposition from anywhere,

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.920
you shun it and sit away from it.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.680
You don’t want to face the opposition — of any negative opposition,

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.640
whether it is by speech or by… even by evil methods.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:05.040
We run away from that, thinking,
“Oh God! How are we going to face it?”

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.480
On the contrary, a person who is negative, who has got hatred,

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:17.560
becomes… [Marathi word?] they call it, means a person who talks big.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.880
Such a person talks… starts talking big.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.280
He thinks he is above everybody else, he can befool all the world.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.080
He takes a responsibility on himself.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:38.840
He starts a big ashram or some big place
where he sits down with all his ignorance

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:45.920
and starts spreading his knowledge — the so-called — to people.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:52.880
By his methods people get impressed,
and they all go and fall at his feet.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.440
While the realized sits at home quietly,

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.280
wondering what are these fools doing.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:09.160
But it is not now for the realized to sit down

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.120
and to wonder and laugh at the foolishness of the people

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.720
who are not yet realized.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:21.000
Not even to take pity on them but to come out,

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.440
come out with the sword of love to win the whole world.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.080
It is very, very essential.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.240
If the creation has to be saved,

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.640
then you are not to keep mum about it.

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.280
All the wrong ideas about love,

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:51.200
all the falsehood about love has to be given up.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:57.160
One must know that it is the dynamic power.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:02.600
And it won’t allow you to sit comfortably with yourself,

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.520
enjoying the peace and the bliss,

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:10.000
when the rest of the world is not enjoying that

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:16.040
and is playing into the hands of the evil geniuses

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.040
who have come in this world to destroy

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:27.640
and to bring the satanic realm

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.520
on this earth.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.480
Now the days are gone when the people had to suffer.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.280
Christ suffered for us.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.760
Of course, Christ never suffered, because He never suffered.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.880
He never wept.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:53.240
He was like those cocks, a very powerful personality.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.720
But today is the day

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.880
to brighten up your understanding

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.360
about your own strength that is within you.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:16.320
Those who are gross should worry about their insecurities,

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:20.760
and their problems, and their organizations —

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.920
but not for the people who are realized.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:29.160
I have told you many a times — and today he also remarked —

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.800
that you should know you are never alone when you are realized.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.640
There have been many people who have been realized,

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:41.280
before even you were born, who exist,

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:46.600
who are anxious to help you at every moment.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.520
In our shastras [scriptures] we call them
chiranjivas [eternal beings], you know them.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:02.280
They are people who are niranjanas [pure, free from falsehood].

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:10.720
As he said about Bhairava and Hanumana, all these people exist,

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:16.680
and they are waiting just for a call from you.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.400
Once we went to the market,

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.320
and there was a problem

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.160
about something.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:43.160
And I had somebody with Me, a disciple… who was also with Me.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.480
I just wanted to see what will be his reaction.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:51.800
He tried to argue out with a person to tell him about something.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.280
So he told Me, “Mataji, let us go now.”

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.160
When we came out the shop, I said,
“What are you going to do about it?”

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.880
He said, “I have already told Hanuman to look after that part.”

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.280
And the work was done.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.760
It is gross, but it happens.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.160
When they fail,

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:16.960
you can leave it to anyone of them,
and they will have to jolly well do it.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.760
Because it is you who are on the stage and not they.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.240
They are the background people.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.280
They are the playbacks.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.320
But you must open your mouth; otherwise, if they start thinking,

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.400
what will people say?

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:38.120
They are going to help you in every way,

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.800
but how far are you standing on your security?

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:47.920
How far you are standing on your
property, on your understanding of yourself?

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.800
It’s a great war going on.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.920
You are not aware of it?

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.720
Some of you are.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.960
Some of you are definitely aware of it

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:06.400
because they have had the experience of fighting it out.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.920
It’s a big war on.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:22.400
Now specially, when ten rakshasas [demons]
have taken their avataras [incarnations].

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:29.360
And for you to be so feeble…

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.520
You are still small children, no doubt,

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.040
because you got your Realization only a few days back.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.480
But if you want, you can grow very fast.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:46.120
You can grow into big, big giants.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.760
All of you can grow.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:53.640
Only thing, you have to decide that you have to grow within.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.200
There are so many things

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:03.920
that you only have discovered, by which a person grows.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.440
I can give you food,

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:14.240
but you have to grow yourself.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:22.320
Wherever you see the negativity, you have to stand up and say,

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:26.280
“This is negativity and nothing else, whether you like it or not.”

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.000
In that, you love that person, you don’t hate.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:34.640
Only talking sweetly is not the idea of love.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:38.600
No, a mother sometimes even scolds the child.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.000
Doesn’t mean that she doesn’t love him.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:45.120
If it is necessary, you have to tell the person that it is negativity.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:49.440
Of course, if there’s a realized person, he won’t mind any correction,

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.840
because he wants the correction, he knows that it has to be corrected.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:58.920
The instrument has to be corrected.
But a person who doesn’t understand,

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.000
you have to force your love on that person.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:06.280
You can force that love, you know that — sitting down here.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:11.200
Many people have tried putting love around certain people

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.520
who were trying to be mischievous —

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:18.320
and they have been able to achieve great results.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.760
Those people have turned back and come back.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.760
Only by putting your hand and putting your attention on that person

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.480
and moving this hand like this,

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:32.040
the love encircles, and the person comes back.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:39.840
There is no doubt that there is negativity and positivity,

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.760
nothing in between these, you must remember.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.200
There is no compromise between the two.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:49.120
Either it is light and darkness,

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:54.120
or it is positive and negative —

00:15:54.240 --> 00:16:00.240
definitely there are two things that are fighting.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:10.160
Only thing, your will — that’s the trouble with the whole joke.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:15.520
That your will is respected, your will is throughout respected.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:22.080
If you have the will to be a giant that loves, you can be.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.480
The other day I met a psychiatrist,

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.040
and he was catching his superego very much.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.640
I said, “What’s wrong with you?” He said, “My childhood.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.200
My childhood, I couldn’t get much love.”

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.680
I said, “Now I am there. You come in My lap. Take the love.”

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.360
He said, “I want to flow my love, Mother.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:45.560
I want to open out myself, completely, without any fear.”

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.600
I said, “You just start it.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:53.720
Don’t worry what people are going to misunderstand,

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.440
what people are going to say.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.920
It’s nothing important what people are going to say or anything.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:03.640
For love, the satisfaction is only
love, that you love another person.”

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.720
“You just flow your love,” I said,
“and you will feel it will work out.

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:11.960
Just decide that ‘I am going to love people.’

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.440
And once you decide that, the whole heaven,

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:21.760
the whole power of the heaven will fall at your feet.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.320
You believe Me in this.”

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:29.120
If you see otherwise, I am an ordinary housewife.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.160
Some people always say, “Mataji, how can be like this?”

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.640
Why not? I am just like you.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.960
I have the same problems as you have.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.840
But only thing I know,

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:45.120
that I am nothing but embodiment of that love that is divine,

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:48.400
and I can’t exist without it.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:54.480
Every moment of My life let the love flow, let the love flow.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:18:02.040
Every wave of My mind conveys the love.

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:11.280
And that makes you completely powerful.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.920
If you read… I was reading Devi Mahatmyam that…

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.200
they talk about a rakshasa

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:24.600
who faced Primordial Mother, the Divine Mother,

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.560
and he laughed at Her: “You woman!
What can you do to me, you are a woman!

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.080
What can you do to me?”

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:37.200
And She smiled at him and said, “All right, come along, let us see.”

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:42.520
And with one stroke, She cut his throat.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:46.040
Very clearly that shows

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.320
that positivity can cut the throat of negativity.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.480
There is no himsa [violence] in that.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.840
You must remember the difference between the two.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.160
If negativity is cut and positive brought out,

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:01.720
that is the greatest ahimsa [non-violence] you can do to someone.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:06.080
You have seen what negativity does to
people; you have now known what is negativity.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:10.680
You have seen how people suffer with spirits on them.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.000
And here, they are also anxious to be loved your way,

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:20.320
you’ll be surprised to know that — if you really love them.

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:24.400
They themselves come to Me and say, “Give me salvation, Mother.”

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:29.320
They come to Me only for that — sometimes
with you — that I should give them salvation.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.120
And if I promise that, they take the birth again.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.640
But there are rakshasas, there are rakshasas.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:41.080
As I told you the other day, the Kali Yuga has laid a beautiful stage,

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:45.440
and a very wonderful drama is to be played —

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:54.480
in which the Ravana has to love Sita as a mother,

00:19:54.600 --> 00:20:00.120
the Kansa has to fall at the feet of Radha.

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:08.360
Perhaps, you do not know that Krishna wanted to kill Kansa.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.040
At that time, he was His uncle.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.440
So, you see, the feeling came in Him, of His mother,

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.760
that “After all, he is my brother.”

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.360
So He asked Radha, and Radha killed him —

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.880
the Radha, who loved the whole world at that time.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.720
She is the embodiment of love, and She killed Kansa —

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:32.400
because it was to be.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:36.040
When you are playing in the hands of God,

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:42.160
then, if He wants to kill some body, it has to be slain.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:50.080
But first of all you have to be in the hands of God completely.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:56.200
It is His love only which kills this body.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:15.880
And when the songs of their strength and victory is sung —

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
you have seen it, all My chakras,
how they start working and vibrating.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:26.520
Because the strength of those victorious days

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:32.240
is still lingering on, and it is going to work through you.

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:36.560
But what about your poor instrument,

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.480
which is moving little slowly?

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:55.840
The time when love has to rule, the Satya Yuga,

00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:04.320
if it has to come, it is going to be through your efforts, now.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:11.400
Before Sahaja Yoga, no efforts. But now, all your efforts are divine.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:15.120
Whatever you do, whatever sympathetic you activate,

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:21.760
you are getting it through parasympathetic
— you don’t do anything at all.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:29.880
But you can see yourself what stakes are involved.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.680
You are the chosen ones, otherwise why is it

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:41.040
that you are the only people who got this Realization

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.520
and so much you have come forward?

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:47.960
Some of you got it only few days back and have gone very far. Why?

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:53.560
You are the chosen ones, and you have to take it upon yourself

00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:01.840
to be the channels of that divine love, that dynamic power,

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:07.320
which is going to transform the whole conception of hatred

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:13.040
on which all these nations and all these differences are created.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.720
It looks sometimes: how? how can it be?

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:29.560
But now the days are gone, of
Gokul [city of Shri Krishna’s childhood].

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.320
I was thinking of it.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.920
Of the time when Krishna used to play His flute

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:39.440
and He tried His Sahaja Yoga on the
gopis and the gopas [cowherd girls and boys].

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.880
Oh, we tried and tried and tried, in different lives!

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.800
Nothing worked.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:53.920
And now it is going to click like a spark.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.280
The chain reaction will start.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.760
But we have to have strong machines to carry that.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:08.200
Otherwise the fuse will be off.

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:12.440
Only the strength that is in you is to be felt by your attention.

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:16.120
That’s the only thing you have to do — is to feel your attention

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.960
and give up all that is falsehood.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.560
All that is falsehood you see within yourself,

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.080
and you will know what is falsehood and just drop it.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:28.800
Accept only the truth, and the truth will give you that power

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:32.200
to be the real instrument,

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:36.120
to carry this channel,

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.320
that force of love.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:54.480
It should not mean that you have to be egoistic —

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:58.120
you cannot be even if you try to.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.920
You cannot harm anyone even if you want to trouble.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.360
So many of you have expressed

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:07.960
that “Mataji, You are giving it to every Dick, Tom
and Harry.” I can’t give it to Dick, Tom and Harry —

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:10.200
it has to be a man who has been searching,

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:13.480
it has to be a woman who has been searching in their previous lives.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:18.960
You should know that whatever you
have got it, you have got it in your own right.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:22.120
So, a person may look like a Dick, Tom, Harry,

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.800
but he is not, he’s a great saint.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.680
They are all saints sitting here.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:31.120
It’s a centre and nucleus of saintliness

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:34.880
where the complete Divine is flowing.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.040
Only thing is, let it flow out from you.

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:47.160
This power is that of God,

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.720
and it is not your responsibility

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:53.120
to worry as to whether it will do good or bad.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.600
Even if you think that it may do some bad things

00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:00.720
according to the moral sciences of this world,

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.760
ultimately it is going to be all right.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:08.920
Why that Jarasandha was to be killed? Why that Kansa was to be killed?

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:12.280
Why Ravana was to be killed?

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:17.120
Of course, killing doesn’t help much — that I have realized.

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:22.160
Because all those who were killed are back again in their saddles.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:29.200
But still, you don’t fight

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.800
those horrible people.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:37.720
You just fight yourself out.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:43.000
You just watch yourself.

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:46.640
Where are you? What are you doing?

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:51.800
Are you on the divine or on the gross?

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:55.680
Just think about it every moment,

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.440
every moment you are in meditation.

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:02.840
Just think of the moment and the dynamism of that moment.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:08.440
The complete power that is filling every moment just to go inside you.

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.760
It will flow through your Sahastrara inside your being,

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:17.360
and completely revolve around your whole being,

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:21.680
and transform the inside into a complete Chaitanya Shakti,

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.360
a complete Divine Power.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:29.160
Allow it to come in, accept it.

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.400
Accept it without any fear.

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:34.520
Let it get in.

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:41.920
Every moment, every moment keep awake.

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:46.760
It’s a very precarious time that we are up to.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:51.040
I have only two hands, you can see that very clearly.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:54.400
And though Mr. ___ says that I can do everything,

00:27:54.520 --> 00:28:01.240
I can do everything but not to make you do something.

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:06.240
Your will will be respected throughout.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:13.480
Every other thing can be looked after

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:19.720
except for one — that you should be a perfect machine,

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:26.600
a perfect channel, a perfect flute

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:32.280
for My Lord to play that tune of love.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:38.320
It is for you to clear out all your seven holes.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.040
It is for you to clear out your hollowness

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:51.840
and to be complete within yourself — and He knows His job.

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:56.840
He is the artist.

00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:01.520
But you are the instruments.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:07.640
And the harmonious music from so many souls

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:12.640
can fill the ears of these evil people

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:17.480
and can penetrate into their heart and put love into them,

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:24.160
and may be that they themselves will give up their evil ways

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:28.240
and fall at the feet of love.

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:39.320
Krishna is to be born within you today.

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:51.680
A five-year-old boy went to kill Kaliya
[monstrous serpent who lived in river Yamuna].

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:56.600
That Krishna is to be born within you.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:59.960
Went and sat on the Kaliya’s Sahastrara

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.000
and was pressing with His feet,

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:09.080
and all the people were seeing this great drama

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:14.680
of Krishna’s dancing on the Kaliya’s Sahastrara.

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:21.880
Krishna is to be born within your being.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:33.200
When you are Krishna, you are not going to see Him.

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:52.640
Let us now go to the state

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.720
which is beyond words,

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.360
beyond thoughts,

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:06.120
into the realm of thoughtless awareness,

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:12.480
where the Divine is pouring its blessings.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:25.320
These people have decided today to have a puja,

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:30.160
and you know what happens to Me when you do My puja.

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:35.560
So, with all those problems that we’ll be facing later,

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:40.240
I would like all of you to be attentive about the puja

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:47.320
and to take full advantage of that.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:52.960
With this puja you get the Mother’s protection,to begin with.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.640
And My chakras, when they start moving,

00:31:55.760 --> 00:32:00.400
they give you special powers of love,

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:05.400
and bless all your chakras, and fill them up completely.

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:08.480
So I would like you —

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.360
though some two people are coming to do this —

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:14.440
all of you to feel that you all are doing it —

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:18.080
and you can feel it that way with oneness.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:24.600
And the blessings of My being will flow to you automatically.
