WEBVTT

00:01.555 --> 00:03.200
… by the Divine.

00:05.532 --> 00:10.252
For example, if I know only my head,
that is not sufficient.

00:10.452 --> 00:13.932
If I know only my neck,
that is not sufficient.

00:14.132 --> 00:18.892
If I know only my legs,
that is not sufficient.

00:19.332 --> 00:22.372
But the more I know about myself,

00:22.572 --> 00:26.452
the more dynamic I become,

00:26.652 --> 00:31.852
the more expansive I become.

00:32.052 --> 00:41.292
And all the great that existed —

00:41.312 --> 00:45.032
or all the people
who were called as great —

00:45.232 --> 00:50.552
are great because they lived
in many human beings.

00:55.819 --> 01:00.539
I feel that warmth in the atmosphere,

01:00.739 --> 01:04.419
as you are feeling because you know
they are not foreigners,

01:04.619 --> 01:08.219
they are your brothers and sisters.

01:11.779 --> 01:17.779
There are so many stories
in Puranas like this, that…

01:19.372 --> 01:26.572
I will not name it, but once
two brothers met in a jungle.

01:29.467 --> 01:32.221
But they thought that they were enemies,

01:32.333 --> 01:35.493
and they wanted to fight with each other.

01:35.693 --> 01:40.413
And when they came to blows,
they couldn’t hit each other.

01:43.022 --> 01:47.022
Then they took out their arrows —
the arrows wouldn’t work.

01:47.222 --> 01:51.382
They were quite surprised at this,

01:51.582 --> 01:55.742
and when they asked each other,
“Who is your mother?”,

01:55.942 --> 01:59.662
they found out mother was the same.

02:00.142 --> 02:06.102
And then they realized that they were
not foreigners neither enemies

02:06.302 --> 02:11.022
but they were made of the same fibre.

02:14.570 --> 02:20.570
What sweetness, what beauty
that knowledge has given them!

02:25.377 --> 02:28.130
And what security of understanding

02:28.155 --> 02:31.904
that everywhere in the whole world
we have brothers and sisters,

02:32.136 --> 02:37.536
who are on their inner being,
on their divine,

02:37.736 --> 02:42.856
and how we are bound together
with that love!

02:44.887 --> 02:46.607
When I talk of love,

02:46.807 --> 02:51.687
people think that I am trying
to make you weak people —

02:51.887 --> 02:57.247
because people think
those who love are weak.

02:58.807 --> 03:05.367
But the most dynamic power
in this world is that of love.

03:07.132 --> 03:13.012
Is the most aggressive power —
is that of love.

03:14.052 --> 03:17.892
Even we, when we suffer in love,

03:18.092 --> 03:24.092
it is out of our strength that we suffer
and not out of our weakness.

03:28.287 --> 03:31.767
For example,
there was a teacher in China

03:31.967 --> 03:38.807
who used to teach the cocks
how to fight.

03:43.039 --> 03:48.087
And the king of that place
took his cocks to that teacher

03:48.287 --> 03:52.673
and told him that
“You please teach them how to fight.”

03:52.780 --> 03:58.900
After one month, when the king
went to take those cocks with him,

03:59.620 --> 04:04.660
he was surprised that the cocks
were just silent, doing nothing.

04:04.850 --> 04:07.450
And he told the teacher that
“What have you done to my cocks?

04:07.650 --> 04:10.250
They are not at all aggressive,
they are not doing anything!

04:10.450 --> 04:13.490
How are they going to fight it out?

04:13.690 --> 04:16.490
There’s going to be a race,

04:16.690 --> 04:19.264
there’s going to be an exhibition
of their strength,

04:19.391 --> 04:21.271
and what are we going to do about it?”

04:21.471 --> 04:24.191
He said, “You just take them.”

04:24.391 --> 04:30.191
He took those two cocks with him
and put them in the arena

04:30.391 --> 04:34.991
where there were other cocks
who had come to fight.

04:35.014 --> 04:38.374
These two cocks
were very nicely standing.

04:38.574 --> 04:44.134
All the other cocks
started coaxing and torturing.

04:44.334 --> 04:48.054
They were just standing
and looking at them.

04:48.641 --> 04:54.001
All the other cocks were surprised
at their behaviour

04:54.201 --> 04:56.801
and thought that they were very powerful.

04:57.001 --> 05:00.001
And they all fled away.

05:02.932 --> 05:08.252
The love that I’m talking about,
the divine love,

05:09.812 --> 05:15.612
makes you not only strong but dynamic.

05:16.852 --> 05:22.852
It is the greatest luminous power
that we can think of.

05:24.072 --> 05:31.952
Only when love is surrounded by gross
and is lost in the gross,

05:33.032 --> 05:38.992
it looks as if it is weak
and “under chains”.

05:39.192 --> 05:45.192
The time it is released,
the dynamic power of love

05:48.527 --> 05:53.887
can transcend
all the evil powers of the world.

05:58.967 --> 06:02.247
When people get their Realization,

06:02.278 --> 06:08.278
automatically the ego drops out —
to a great extent, I should say.

06:08.558 --> 06:12.758
Because you say
that the vibrations are passing;

06:12.958 --> 06:16.398
you don’t say that you are giving them.

06:20.780 --> 06:24.420
Because the dropping of the ego

06:24.620 --> 06:31.660
sometimes it happens that you feel

06:31.917 --> 06:35.197
that whatever you wanted to have
you have got it

06:35.397 --> 06:38.677
and you better not talk about it.

06:39.037 --> 06:41.597
When there is any opposition
from anywhere,

06:41.797 --> 06:46.837
you shun it and sit away from it.

06:46.957 --> 06:52.637
You don’t want to face the opposition —
of any negative opposition,

06:52.837 --> 06:58.717
whether it is by speech
or by… even by evil methods.

06:58.917 --> 07:04.317
We run away from that, thinking,
“Oh God! How are we going to face it?”

07:05.996 --> 07:11.316
On the contrary, a person
who is negative, who has got hatred,

07:11.516 --> 07:17.516
becomes… [Marathi word?] they call it,
means a person who talks big.

07:17.796 --> 07:22.716
Such a person talks… starts talking big.

07:23.236 --> 07:28.556
He thinks he is above everybody else,
he can befool all the world.

07:28.589 --> 07:32.309
He takes a responsibility on himself.

07:32.509 --> 07:38.509
He starts a big ashram or some big place
where he sits down with all his ignorance

07:38.889 --> 07:44.889
and starts spreading his knowledge —
the so-called — to people.

07:46.209 --> 07:52.209
By his methods people get impressed,
and they all go and fall at his feet.

07:53.209 --> 07:56.609
While the realized sits at home quietly,

07:56.809 --> 08:00.529
wondering what are these fools doing.

08:03.314 --> 08:09.114
But it is not now
for the realized to sit down

08:09.314 --> 08:13.194
and to wonder and laugh
at the foolishness of the people

08:13.394 --> 08:15.914
who are not yet realized.

08:16.114 --> 08:21.274
Not even to take pity on them
but to come out,

08:22.032 --> 08:26.272
come out with the sword of love
to win the whole world.

08:26.472 --> 08:30.032
It is very, very essential.

08:30.232 --> 08:33.272
If the creation has to be saved,

08:33.472 --> 08:37.752
then you are not to keep mum about it.

08:42.620 --> 08:46.180
All the wrong ideas about love,

08:46.380 --> 08:51.220
all the falsehood about love
has to be given up.

08:51.420 --> 08:57.300
One must know
that it is the dynamic power.

08:57.322 --> 09:02.644
And it won’t allow you
to sit comfortably with yourself,

09:02.708 --> 09:05.348
enjoying the peace and the bliss,

09:05.548 --> 09:09.948
when the rest of the world
is not enjoying that

09:10.148 --> 09:16.108
and is playing into the hands
of the evil geniuses

09:16.136 --> 09:20.468
who have come in this world to destroy

09:20.668 --> 09:28.148
and to bring the satanic realm

09:29.633 --> 09:32.353
on this earth.

09:32.553 --> 09:35.433
Now the days are gone
when the people had to suffer.

09:35.633 --> 09:37.313
Christ suffered for us.

09:37.513 --> 09:41.913
Of course, Christ never suffered,
because He never suffered.

09:42.113 --> 09:45.113
He never wept.

09:47.845 --> 09:53.245
He was like those cocks,
a very powerful personality.

09:53.485 --> 09:56.605
But today is the day

09:57.085 --> 10:00.165
to brighten up your understanding

10:00.365 --> 10:05.725
about your own strength
that is within you.

10:10.158 --> 10:16.158
Those who are gross
should worry about their insecurities,

10:16.438 --> 10:20.798
and their problems,
and their organizations —

10:20.998 --> 10:25.078
but not for the people who are realized.

10:25.278 --> 10:29.358
I have told you many a times —
and today he also remarked —

10:29.558 --> 10:33.118
that you should know you are never alone
when you are realized.

10:33.318 --> 10:35.622
There have been many people
who have been realized,

10:35.702 --> 10:38.222
before even you were born,

10:38.422 --> 10:41.382
who exist,

10:41.582 --> 10:46.782
who are anxious to help you
at every moment.

10:53.132 --> 10:57.372
In our shastras [scriptures] we call them
chiranjivas [eternal beings], you know them.

10:57.572 --> 11:01.612
They are people who are niranjanas
[pure, free from falsehood].

11:04.812 --> 11:10.806
As he said about Bhairava and Hanumana,
all these people exist,

11:10.854 --> 11:15.894
and they are waiting
just for a call from you.

11:20.999 --> 11:24.159
Once we went to the market,

11:28.879 --> 11:32.559
and there was a problem

11:34.427 --> 11:37.427
about something.

11:38.227 --> 11:43.027
And I had somebody with Me, a disciple…
who was also with Me.

11:43.227 --> 11:46.347
I just wanted to see
what will be his reaction.

11:46.547 --> 11:51.627
He tried to argue out with a person
to tell him about something.

11:52.347 --> 11:54.747
So he told Me, “Mataji, let us go now.”

11:54.947 --> 11:58.027
When we came out the shop, I said,
“What are you going to do about it?”

11:58.227 --> 12:02.187
He said, “I have already told Hanuman
to look after that part.”

12:02.387 --> 12:04.627
And the work was done.

12:04.827 --> 12:08.187
It is gross, but it happens.

12:09.971 --> 12:12.131
When they fail
[Shri Mataji could mean “you fail”],

12:12.331 --> 12:16.971
you can leave it to anyone of them,
and they will have to jolly well do it.

12:17.171 --> 12:20.891
Because it is you who are on the stage
and not they.

12:21.091 --> 12:24.251
They are the background people.

12:24.485 --> 12:27.125
They are the playbacks.

12:27.325 --> 12:31.285
But you must open your mouth;
otherwise, if they start thinking,

12:31.485 --> 12:33.485
what will people say?

12:33.685 --> 12:38.245
They are going to help you in every way,

12:38.445 --> 12:41.678
but how far are you standing
on your security?

12:41.896 --> 12:47.896
How far you are standing on your property,
on your understanding of yourself?

12:51.390 --> 12:53.910
It’s a great war going on.

12:54.110 --> 12:55.830
You are not aware of it?

12:56.030 --> 12:57.750
Some of you are.

12:57.950 --> 12:59.790
Some of you are definitely aware of it

12:59.990 --> 13:05.110
because they have had the experience
of fighting it out.

13:12.517 --> 13:14.757
It’s a big war on.

13:14.957 --> 13:20.957
Now specially, when ten rakshasas [demons]
have taken their avataras [incarnations].

13:24.677 --> 13:30.037
And for you to be so feeble…

13:32.969 --> 13:36.369
You are still small children, no doubt,

13:36.569 --> 13:39.889
because you got your Realization
only a few days back.

13:40.089 --> 13:42.329
But if you want, you can grow very fast.

13:42.529 --> 13:46.089
You can grow into big, big giants.

13:46.289 --> 13:47.849
All of you can grow.

13:48.049 --> 13:53.809
Only thing, you have to decide
that you have to grow within.

13:55.481 --> 13:58.041
There are so many things

13:58.241 --> 14:03.841
that you only have discovered,
by which a person grows.

14:06.601 --> 14:09.601
I can give you food,

14:10.641 --> 14:14.361
but you have to grow yourself.

14:18.784 --> 14:22.184
Wherever you see the negativity,
you have to stand up and say,

14:22.384 --> 14:26.144
“This is negativity and nothing else,
whether you like it or not.”

14:26.344 --> 14:30.264
In that, you love that person,
you don’t hate.

14:30.265 --> 14:34.785
Only talking sweetly
is not the idea of love.

14:34.985 --> 14:38.825
No, a mother sometimes
even scolds the child.

14:39.025 --> 14:41.345
Doesn’t mean that she doesn’t love him.

14:41.545 --> 14:45.425
If it is necessary, you have to tell
the person that it is negativity.

14:45.625 --> 14:49.425
Of course, if there’s a realized person,
he won’t mind any correction,

14:49.625 --> 14:53.305
because he wants the correction,
he knows that it has to be corrected.

14:53.505 --> 14:55.265
The instrument has to be corrected.

14:55.465 --> 14:58.785
But a person who doesn’t understand,

14:59.033 --> 15:01.833
you have to force your love
on that person.

15:02.033 --> 15:06.233
You can force that love,
you know that — sitting down here.

15:06.433 --> 15:11.273
Many people have tried putting love
around certain people

15:11.473 --> 15:13.513
who were trying to be mischievous —

15:13.713 --> 15:18.633
and they have been able to achieve
great results.

15:18.833 --> 15:22.153
Those people have turned back
and come back.

15:22.353 --> 15:25.993
Only by putting your hand
and putting your attention on that person

15:26.193 --> 15:27.833
and moving this hand like this,

15:28.033 --> 15:32.473
the love encircles,
and the person comes back.

15:33.324 --> 15:39.804
There is no doubt
that there is negativity and positivity,

15:40.004 --> 15:42.844
nothing in between these,
you must remember.

15:43.044 --> 15:45.204
There is no compromise between the two.

15:45.404 --> 15:49.204
Either it is light and darkness,

15:50.554 --> 15:54.074
or it is positive and negative —

15:54.274 --> 16:00.274
definitely there are two things
that are fighting.

16:05.062 --> 16:10.022
Only thing, your will —
that’s the trouble with the whole joke.

16:10.222 --> 16:15.502
That your will is respected,
your will is throughout respected.

16:15.702 --> 16:21.862
If you have the will
to be a giant that loves, you can be.

16:22.622 --> 16:25.942
The other day I met a psychiatrist,

16:25.956 --> 16:27.876
and he was catching
his superego very much.

16:28.076 --> 16:29.596
I said, “What’s wrong with you?”

16:29.796 --> 16:34.156
He said, “My childhood.
My childhood, I couldn’t get much love.”

16:34.356 --> 16:37.996
I said, “Now I am there.
You come in My lap. Take the love.”

16:38.196 --> 16:40.796
He said, “I want to flow my love, Mother.

16:40.996 --> 16:46.116
I want to open out myself,
completely, without any fear.”

16:46.316 --> 16:49.276
I said, “You just start it.

16:49.476 --> 16:53.716
Don’t worry what people
are going to misunderstand,

16:54.089 --> 16:55.289
what people are going to say.

16:55.489 --> 16:58.889
It’s nothing important
what people are going to say or anything.

16:59.089 --> 17:03.729
For love, the satisfaction is only love,
that you love another person.”

17:03.929 --> 17:07.929
“You just flow your love,” I said,
“and you will feel it will work out.

17:08.129 --> 17:12.249
Just decide that ‘I am going
to love people.’

17:14.377 --> 17:17.377
And once you decide that,
the whole heaven,

17:17.577 --> 17:21.777
the whole power of the heaven
will fall at your feet.

17:21.977 --> 17:24.457
You believe Me in this.”

17:24.657 --> 17:29.297
If you see otherwise,
I am an ordinary housewife.

17:29.383 --> 17:32.023
Some people always say,
“Mataji, how can be like this?”

17:32.048 --> 17:34.663
Why not? I am just like you.

17:34.685 --> 17:37.925
I have the same problems as you have.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.925
But only thing I know,

17:40.125 --> 17:45.101
that I am nothing but embodiment
of that love that is divine,

17:45.181 --> 17:48.381
and I can’t exist without it.

17:48.581 --> 17:54.581
Every moment of My life
let the love flow, let the love flow.

17:54.821 --> 18:02.261
Every wave of My mind conveys the love.

18:06.017 --> 18:11.097
And that makes you completely powerful.

18:11.657 --> 18:15.137
If you read…
I was reading Devi Mahatmyam that…

18:15.337 --> 18:18.537
they talk about a rakshasa

18:18.737 --> 18:24.737
who faced Primordial Mother,
the Divine Mother,

18:24.752 --> 18:29.632
and he laughed at Her: “You woman!
What can you do to me, you are a woman!

18:29.832 --> 18:31.272
What can you do to me?”

18:31.472 --> 18:37.472
And She smiled at him and said,
“All right, come along, let us see.”

18:38.264 --> 18:42.424
And with one stroke, She cut his throat.

18:42.624 --> 18:46.064
Very clearly that shows

18:46.264 --> 18:49.427
that positivity can cut
the throat of negativity.

18:49.491 --> 18:51.331
There is no himsa [violence] in that.

18:51.531 --> 18:54.811
You must remember the difference
between the two.

18:55.011 --> 18:58.251
If negativity is cut
and positive brought out,

18:58.451 --> 19:01.861
that is the greatest ahimsa [non-violence]
you can do to someone.

19:02.052 --> 19:05.812
You have seen what negativity does to people;
you have now known what is negativity.

19:06.012 --> 19:10.492
You have seen how people suffer
with spirits on them.

19:12.445 --> 19:16.085
And here, they are also anxious
to be loved your way,

19:16.285 --> 19:20.525
you’ll be surprised to know that —
if you really love them.

19:20.725 --> 19:24.725
They themselves come to Me
and say, “Give me salvation, Mother.”

19:24.925 --> 19:27.525
They come to Me only for that —
sometimes with you —

19:27.725 --> 19:29.645
that I should give them salvation.

19:29.845 --> 19:32.365
And if I promise that,
they take the birth again.

19:32.565 --> 19:35.632
But there are rakshasas,
there are rakshasas.

19:35.671 --> 19:41.191
As I told you the other day,
the Kali Yuga has laid a beautiful stage,

19:41.391 --> 19:45.511
and a very wonderful drama
is to be played —

19:45.711 --> 19:53.911
in which the Ravana
has to love Sita as a mother,

19:54.754 --> 20:00.034
the Kansa has to fall
at the feet of Radha.

20:02.275 --> 20:08.275
Perhaps, you do not know
that Krishna wanted to kill Kansa.

20:08.635 --> 20:11.235
At that time, he was His uncle.

20:11.435 --> 20:14.755
So, you see, the feeling came in Him,
of His mother,

20:14.955 --> 20:17.995
that “After all, he is my brother.”
[Shri Mataji could mean “her brother”]

20:17.998 --> 20:20.198
So He asked Radha, and Radha killed him —

20:20.398 --> 20:24.078
the Radha, who loved
the whole world at that time.

20:24.103 --> 20:27.998
She is the embodiment of love,
and She killed Kansa —

20:28.198 --> 20:32.318
because it was to be.

20:32.439 --> 20:35.879
When you are playing
in the hands of God,

20:36.079 --> 20:42.079
then, if He wants to kill some body,
it has to be slain.

20:45.319 --> 20:50.319
But first of all you have to be
in the hands of God completely.

20:50.519 --> 20:56.519
It is His love only
which kills this body.

21:03.366 --> 21:16.246
And when the songs
of their strength and victory is sung —

21:16.446 --> 21:21.366
you have seen it, all My chakras,
how they start working and vibrating.

21:21.566 --> 21:27.006
Because the strength
of those victorious days

21:27.206 --> 21:32.358
is still lingering on,
and it is going to work through you.

21:32.391 --> 21:36.591
But what about your poor instrument,

21:38.725 --> 21:42.485
which is moving little slowly?

21:50.205 --> 21:56.325
The time when love has to rule,
the Satya Yuga,

21:56.525 --> 22:04.885
if it has to come, it is going to be
through your efforts, now.

22:05.372 --> 22:11.372
Before Sahaja Yoga, no efforts.
But now, all your efforts are divine.

22:11.652 --> 22:15.332
Whatever you do,
whatever sympathetic you activate,

22:15.532 --> 22:20.852
you are getting it through parasympathetic —
you don’t do anything at all.

22:23.896 --> 22:29.896
But you can see yourself
what stakes are involved.

22:35.294 --> 22:37.654
You are the chosen ones,
otherwise why is it

22:37.854 --> 22:40.734
that you are the only people
who got this Realization

22:40.934 --> 22:43.374
and so much you have come forward?

22:43.574 --> 22:47.934
Some of you got it only few days back
and have gone very far. Why?

22:48.134 --> 22:53.614
You are the chosen ones,
and you have to take it upon yourself

22:56.174 --> 23:01.569
to be the channels of that divine love,
that dynamic power,

23:01.893 --> 23:07.293
which is going to transform
the whole conception of hatred

23:07.493 --> 23:13.093
on which all these nations
and all these differences are created.

23:14.733 --> 23:19.133
It looks sometimes: how? how can it be?

23:25.642 --> 23:29.442
But now the days are gone, of Gokul
[city of Shri Krishna’s childhood].

23:29.642 --> 23:31.322
I was thinking of it.

23:31.522 --> 23:34.042
Of the time when Krishna
used to play His flute

23:34.242 --> 23:39.642
and He tried His Sahaja Yoga on the gopis
and the gopas [cowherd girls and boys].

23:41.179 --> 23:44.859
Oh, we tried and tried and tried,
in different lives!

23:45.059 --> 23:47.899
Nothing worked.

23:48.099 --> 23:54.099
And now it is going to click
like a spark.

23:57.569 --> 24:00.249
The chain reaction will start.

24:00.449 --> 24:03.849
But we have to have
strong machines to carry that.

24:04.049 --> 24:07.609
Otherwise the fuse will be off.

24:08.232 --> 24:12.472
Only the strength that is in you
is to be felt by your attention.

24:12.672 --> 24:16.072
That’s the only thing you have to do —
is to feel your attention

24:16.272 --> 24:19.232
and give up all that is falsehood.

24:19.432 --> 24:21.592
All that is falsehood
you see within yourself,

24:21.792 --> 24:23.952
and you will know what is falsehood
and just drop it.

24:24.152 --> 24:28.539
Accept only the truth,
and the truth will give you that power

24:28.841 --> 24:32.041
to be the real instrument,

24:32.241 --> 24:35.281
to carry this channel,

24:36.481 --> 24:39.561
that force of love.

24:50.318 --> 24:54.438
It should not mean
that you have to be egoistic —

24:54.638 --> 24:58.158
you cannot be even if you try to.

24:58.398 --> 25:02.038
You cannot harm anyone
even if you want to trouble.

25:02.050 --> 25:03.410
So many of you have expressed

25:03.451 --> 25:05.891
that “Mataji, You are giving it
to every Dick, Tom and Harry.”

25:06.091 --> 25:07.571
I can’t give it to Dick, Tom and Harry —

25:07.771 --> 25:10.171
it has to be a man
who has been searching,

25:10.371 --> 25:13.251
it has to be a woman who has been searching
in their previous lives.

25:13.451 --> 25:18.851
You should know that whatever you have got it,
you have got it in your own right.

25:18.991 --> 25:22.071
So, a person may look
like a Dick, Tom, Harry,

25:22.271 --> 25:24.871
but he is not, he’s a great saint.

25:24.922 --> 25:27.911
They are all saints sitting here.

25:28.111 --> 25:31.471
It’s a centre and nucleus of saintliness

25:31.671 --> 25:35.351
where the complete Divine is flowing.

25:35.551 --> 25:40.591
Only thing is, let it flow out from you.

25:44.166 --> 25:47.086
This power is that of God,

25:47.286 --> 25:49.766
and it is not your responsibility

25:49.966 --> 25:53.286
to worry as to whether it will do
good or bad.

25:53.486 --> 25:56.886
Even if you think
that it may do some bad things

25:57.086 --> 26:00.633
according to the moral sciences
of this world,

26:00.761 --> 26:04.681
ultimately it is going to be all right.

26:04.881 --> 26:08.961
Why that Jarasandha was to be killed?
Why that Kansa was to be killed?

26:09.161 --> 26:12.401
Why Ravana was to be killed?

26:13.283 --> 26:17.083
Of course, killing doesn’t help much —
that I have realized.

26:17.283 --> 26:22.203
Because all those who were killed
are back again in their saddles.

26:24.483 --> 26:29.443
But still, you don’t fight

26:30.619 --> 26:33.739
those horrible people.

26:33.939 --> 26:37.739
You just fight yourself out.

26:39.979 --> 26:43.179
You just watch yourself.

26:43.379 --> 26:46.939
Where are you? What are you doing?

26:47.139 --> 26:52.219
Are you on the divine or on the gross?

26:52.419 --> 26:56.339
Just think about it every moment,

26:56.539 --> 26:59.219
every moment you are in meditation.

26:59.419 --> 27:03.058
Just think of the moment
and the dynamism of that moment.

27:03.201 --> 27:08.328
The complete power that is filling
every moment just to go inside you.

27:08.503 --> 27:11.343
It will flow through your Sahastrara
inside your being,

27:11.543 --> 27:16.983
and completely revolve
around your whole being,

27:17.583 --> 27:21.663
and transform the inside
into a complete Chaitanya Shakti,

27:21.863 --> 27:25.023
a complete Divine Power.

27:25.398 --> 27:28.998
Allow it to come in, accept it.

27:29.198 --> 27:31.358
Accept it without any fear.

27:31.558 --> 27:34.558
Let it get in.

27:37.838 --> 27:42.238
Every moment, every moment keep awake.

27:42.438 --> 27:47.198
It’s a very precarious time
that we are up to.

27:47.398 --> 27:51.598
I have only two hands,
you can see that very clearly.

27:51.798 --> 27:55.398
And though Mr. ___ says
that I can do everything,

27:55.598 --> 28:00.861
I can do everything
but not to make you do something.

28:01.290 --> 28:06.170
Your will will be respected throughout.

28:09.954 --> 28:13.434
Every other thing can be looked after

28:13.634 --> 28:19.634
except for one —
that you should be a perfect machine,

28:20.234 --> 28:26.234
a perfect channel, a perfect flute

28:26.500 --> 28:32.100
for My Lord to play that tune of love.

28:32.380 --> 28:38.300
It is for you to clear out
all your seven holes.

28:42.700 --> 28:46.028
It is for you to clear out
your hollowness

28:46.298 --> 28:51.978
and to be complete within yourself —
and He knows His job.

28:53.639 --> 28:56.959
He is the artist.

28:57.159 --> 29:00.879
But you are the instruments.

29:01.515 --> 29:07.515
And the harmonious music
from so many souls

29:08.795 --> 29:12.795
can fill the ears of these evil people

29:12.820 --> 29:16.965
and can penetrate into their heart
and put love into them,

29:17.288 --> 29:24.168
and may be that they themselves
will give up their evil ways

29:24.368 --> 29:28.328
and fall at the feet of love.

29:33.568 --> 29:39.568
Krishna is to be born within you today.

29:43.972 --> 29:49.972
A five-year-old boy went to kill Kaliya
[monstrous serpent who lived in river Yamuna].

29:51.812 --> 29:56.412
That Krishna is to be born within you.

29:56.932 --> 30:00.212
Went and sat on the Kaliya’s Sahastrara

30:00.412 --> 30:02.891
and was pressing with His feet,

30:02.955 --> 30:08.955
and all the people were seeing
this great drama

30:09.435 --> 30:14.915
of Krishna’s dancing
on the Kaliya’s Sahastrara.

30:16.595 --> 30:21.995
Krishna is to be born within your being.

30:27.365 --> 30:31.725
When you are Krishna,
you are not going to see Him.

30:45.732 --> 30:52.652
Let us now go to the state

30:52.852 --> 30:55.732
which is beyond words,

30:55.932 --> 30:58.492
beyond thoughts,

30:58.692 --> 31:05.452
into the realm of thoughtless awareness,

31:05.853 --> 31:12.093
where the Divine
is pouring its blessings.

31:18.573 --> 31:24.573
These people have decided today
to have a puja,

31:25.328 --> 31:29.848
and you know what happens to Me
when you do My puja.

31:30.408 --> 31:35.728
So, with all those problems
that we’ll be facing later,

31:35.928 --> 31:40.184
I would like all of you
to be attentive about the puja

31:40.359 --> 31:46.719
and to take full advantage of that.

31:46.830 --> 31:52.110
With this puja you get
the Mother’s protection,to begin with.

31:52.790 --> 31:55.390
And My chakras, when they start moving,

31:55.590 --> 32:00.150
they give you special powers of love,

32:00.350 --> 32:05.270
and bless all your chakras,
and fill them up completely.

32:05.470 --> 32:08.470
So I would like you —

32:08.859 --> 32:11.219
though some two people
are coming to do this —

32:11.419 --> 32:14.379
all of you to feel
that you all are doing it —

32:14.579 --> 32:18.139
and you can feel it that way
with oneness.

32:18.164 --> 32:24.539
And the blessings of My being
will flow to you automatically.
