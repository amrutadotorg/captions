00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So welcome again to this second session of Sari stories. And I'm delighted tonight that we've got Prerna Richard and Luis Garrido who are going to be telling us their sharing their stories with us and we're going to start with Prerna.

2
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And so Prerna would you like me to open the first picture?

3
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Not yet. No, thank you. Yes. Jai Shri Mataji everyone. And so the stories for the Sari's with Shri Mataji is really special, has a special place in my heart. Because I met Shri Mataji when I was 14 years old. And growing up in India, being 14, I had never worn a Sari.

4
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Till I met Shri Mataji. And so I wanted to start the stories because there was many things that happened in our time together with Shri Mataji that the Sari's kept coming up. So the very first time I met Shri Mataji was in August of 79.

5
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And in those days, Shri Mataji used to go from London to Delhi, those were the mostly the trips that she would have. And it was a public program that we had in Delhi. And my whole family, and all of us went together for the public program.

6
00:01:39.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And at the end of the public program, after we had gone on the stage to see Shri Mataji, she invited us to come to her house the next day. And so she said, you know, find out the address and you all should come to my daughter's house, Sadhana, and you should all come and see me tomorrow morning.

7
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And when we got to her house, to Sadhana Diti's house, Shri Mataji was there. And I'm not exactly sure how it happened. But somehow, Sadhana Diti asked me and my sister, if we had ever worn a Sari. And we both looked at her and we said, No, we'd never worn a Sari.

8
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And so she took out Shri Mataji's saris. And she started wrapping them around us. And she was sitting on a chair, watching her dress us like dolls. And she was like turning us around and putting the pleats and she was enjoying the show. And it was one of Shri Mataji's saris that she had put on us. And it just felt so joyful. And it felt so

9
00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:23.000
being enveloped with this feeling of just love. I can't explain it in any other way. I don't think I knew about vibrations then I don't think I knew all of the rest of it connected. But I remember that feeling of just being a big hug, like a big love that wrapped around us. So yeah, that was the very first time that I'd worn a Sari and it was Shri Mataji's.

10
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Very special day. It's very vivid in my memory, even now. And the second story, so now we can put the picture up of that dress. Caroline, if that's okay with you. So we got married.

11
00:03:44.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I got married in 84. I married Alan. We were married in 84. And back then we were living in Delhi and the Subrajang ashram, the very first ashram in Delhi, was a very small ashram compared to the Noida ashram. And Shri Mataji was coming there.

12
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:28.000
It was 84 in March after the India tour had finished and it was after her birthday puja and she came to Delhi and everybody was asking, can everybody give saris so that we can make a pathway for Shri Mataji to walk from the door to the stage.

13
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And I had just recently got married. So I had had a whole bunch of new saris, which actually what happened was when we were on the India tour, because we got married in Borde, in Nasik, Shri Mataji had asked my sister and me, Nambhuta and me, to show her the saris that our mom had bought for us.

14
00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And I remember Shri Mataji was sitting on her bed in Nasik and she wanted to see all the saris that our mom had bought for us. And every time we would show her a sari, she would touch it and she would feel it and she would make a comment of how pretty it was or the work was and this and this.

15
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And so it was very beautiful that we had got to share some of our new saris as newly married girls with Shri Mataji. So when she came to Delhi, they were asking for saris to decorate the pathway.

16
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And I was feeling a little bit hesitant because I was like, oh, we're going to put them on the ground. You know, people are going to walk on it. I don't want to ruin these new saris.

17
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:54.000
But then I said, okay, it's okay. Shri Mataji's feet are going to be on it. I should find a sari and I will also contribute. So it was this red silk sari and it was a plain red silk sari. It had no design, no nothing. It was just very soft Chinese silk, just plain red.

18
00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And I gave that to put on the pathway from the door to the stage. And then Shri Mataji walked on it and people had offered flowers like we always do, you know, so there was flowers on the sari.

19
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And what happened was after Shri Mataji walked, the flowers had got pressed into the sari and the juices of the flowers had come. And afterwards, when I picked up the sari, it was full of stains.

20
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And it was covered with these marks from the flowers. And I don't think I could wear it again because it was just all marks everywhere. And I was feeling a little bit bad. But then again, Shri Mataji had walked on it. So it meant something so special and it was so dear.

21
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And so I held on to it for the longest time. And then finally, I think just a few years ago, I've held it on for all these years. I mean, this year, it was 40 years we were married. So I held on to the sari all these years.

22
00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And then recently I made it into a silvar kameez. And this is the shirt. And then the other piece I actually took and we by then we'd had granddaughters. And so we converted this into a tiny, tiny baby dress.

23
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Just because it is so special, because Shri Mataji walked on it and it still feels so cool. I'm touching it right now and it just feels so cool.

24
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:29.000
So, you know, something to live on and tell the grandchildren about the day that the goddesses walked on this piece of material. It just means something.

25
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And then we had, I had moved to London, we were in Brompton Square, staying with Shri Mataji. And that's the next one, Caroline, you can show the picture of the next one. So when we got to Brompton Square, one day, Shri Mataji said to me, this white sari, the ones that she used to wear for the public programs, if you remember, they were plain white, and they were so

26
00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:14.000
silky material, and they were just plain, plain white. And so she asked me if I could put a fall on it at the bottom. And I had never done that. I had no idea how to sew a fall onto a very silky, slippery sari. And I remember sitting in Brompton Square with a lamp shade, like right, the light right there and feeling so angry.

27
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And so nervous that I had to sew this fall on because I didn't want to make a mistake and anything would show up because this material was so silky and so soft and slippery. And it was it was I prayed the whole time I was just praying please Shri Mataji, how can I do this?

28
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And I did this. And she was she asked you a so gracious and so kind and she was like, Oh, this is amazing. You did a great job this and all that. And after that, it became a thing that I was so grateful for. And I was so grateful for the fact that I was able to do this.

29
00:08:46.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And I did this. And she was, she asked you a so gracious and so kind and she was like, Oh, this is amazing. You did a great job this and all that. And after that, it became a thing that she would give me her public program saris to iron. And so I would get that opportunity to iron them. And this is the sari that she must be gifted me after I did the fall for her, which in a fact, she did it because I don't didn't want to make a mistake.

30
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And I didn't know how to do that. I'd never done that. And so she was giving me this. It was a Georgia sari printed all over I still have it. It has faded in many places, but I still hold on to it because she gifted it to me as a thank you for putting the fall in ironing, which was so kind of her and so sweet.

31
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:56.000
And so that became kind of a nice task that somehow she would allow me to iron her public program saris in Brompton Square. There was many of those occasions. And I was so joyful and such a beautiful thing. And then the last story

32
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:23.000
is the one the last sari. This was in LA, and Srimathji was staying in LA. I want to say it was either 2003 or 2004 different centres in America, different collectives would go to LA to have an opportunity to take care of, I mean, take care of the people who are

33
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:44.000
in the care, which is a really strange word. We don't take care of Srimathji, she takes care of us, but the opportunity to be there of service and just to offer whatever we could and to do to help to contribute. And Texas had a chance for one of the weeks and we were there.

34
00:10:44.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And this was a sari that was Srimathji's and Sadhna Didi gave it to me and said that, you know, this is Srimathji's used sari and she would like for you to have it to use because when she gave it to me, she said she would like for you to have it. And I said, to keep thank you so much.

35
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:27.000
And she said, no, no, no, she wants you to wear it. I said, wear it? Like wear Srimathji's sari. I was a little bit surprised. And Srimathji was like, you know, she was like, no, no, she wants you to wear it. And so I have worn it only a couple of times because I still feel very hesitant to wear something that Srimathji wore because I'd rather just keep it.

36
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:54.000
But I will tell you, it has so much vibrations and it brings so much comfort. And I have, you know, in times you go through tough times and tough times in life, I have held this just to my chest and just on the heart. And it just soothes and comforts and builds all the vibrations and all the cells and you can feel her presence.

37
00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And I'm sure many of you have experienced that when Srimathji's given something. So, you know, just little stories that meant a lot. And thank you for the opportunity to share them with you all.

38
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Thank you, Prerana. That was beautiful.

39
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:37.000
So I'm just going to, I have you pinned for the video recording, so I'm just going to unpin you. I'll close your video now and ask Lewis to join us. So Lewis, I think there you are. Lovely. Let me just pin you.

40
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Excellent.

41
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Thank you. Srimathji.

42
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Would you like to show some photos, Caroline?

43
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Sure, I'm at your command. So what would you like me to show?

44
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Srimathji at the wedding of Maria Melea and Arno.

45
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
There's two there.

46
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Yes, that's one of them. So this is Maria Melea and Arno's wedding, which took place in Portugal 1980. And I think there's a lot one could say about this, sorry, but the thing that I find very interesting is that this is the color of the Portuguese flag.

47
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.000
So the Portuguese flag is red and green, but this is the exact correct green of the flag.

48
00:13:44.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And I don't think this is a coincidence that Srimathji wore the color of the Portuguese flag for us, because in everything mother does, she's trying to open our hearts and make us feel well in her presence.

49
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
So this was, I think, a beautiful gesture of Srimathji to choose that color.

50
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:16.000
If you see on the photo also of the wedding of Maria Melea, can you see another one is called the Srimathji in Sintra? It's the same thing.

51
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
I suppose you are looking for the other photo. It says Srimathji in Sintra.

52
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Yeah, I'm just looking for it. I've got it, Louis.

53
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:47.000
It's the same wedding of Maria Melea. And so here we can see again the green, you know, on the sorry blouse. It's exactly the green of the Portuguese flag.

54
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
I don't think it's a coincidence because mother came to Portugal.

55
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:59.000
So now if you could move to a photograph that is entitled Srimathji in Lisbon.

56
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:17.000
So this is again Srimathji in Lisbon, Portugal.

57
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
And here this is Srimathji is about to go. I believe she's about to go to the airport here.

58
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:31.000
In fact, I'm the person there on the left hand side with the beard. That's me very thin in those days.

59
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
I had just, that was the beginning of Sahaja Yoga for me.

60
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:43.000
There's the dog. In fact, this is a dog I sometimes mention in the stories of the dog is there too next to me.

61
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
And Srimathji is wearing a sari that is yellow here.

62
00:15:48.000 --> 00:16:01.000
And this is again quite interesting for Portugal because in Portugal we say we are the country of the sun and Srimathji is wearing the color of the sun is totally yellow that sari.

63
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:10.000
But then she also has a kind of a purple color on the blouse and on the other part of the sari.

64
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:23.000
And this is a color that everybody in Portugal will say this is the color of Christ because during the Easter processions usually the statues of Christ are dressed in that color.

65
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:37.000
I think it's because in the Bible it says that during the when Christ went on trial, he was sent to Herod and Herod was the king of the Jews in those days in the province of Judea.

66
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:44.000
And Herod decided to send Christ back to Pontius Pilatus to be tried.

67
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:57.000
But he also said, you know, let's put a tunic or a cloth of this purple color on Christ.

68
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:07.000
This was in a sense to mock Christ because as if Christ is in a sense people think he's the king of the Jews.

69
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.000
So if he thinks that is the king of the Jews, let him wear the purple which is the color reserved for royalty.

70
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
This was to mock Christ.

71
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:28.000
But in fact all the painters in painters and artistic tradition, they consider that, you know, Christ is indeed the king of the kings is the king of all kings.

72
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
So it deserves to wear that color purple purple.

73
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:39.000
And that's usually the color that is used for Christ during Easter during the processions around the statues of Christ.

74
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
They use this color.

75
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:49.000
So this color is very important because Portugal is a Catholic country and everybody knows about Christ and the Easter processions.

76
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:58.000
And the yellow sun that mother is wearing, but as a special meaning meaning in Portugal because we say we are the country of the sun.

77
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
That's what everybody says. The sun is, you know, is the thing about Portugal.

78
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:13.000
And there was some apparition of the Virgin Mary in Portugal and Sri Mataji confirmed that those apparitions are genuine.

79
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:23.000
When mother came again to Portugal for Diwali puja in Portugal, she said yes, those apparitions of the Virgin Mary, they were genuine.

80
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
That was indeed Sri Mahalakshmi who appeared there and gave those miracles.

81
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:41.000
And one of the miracles that the Virgin Mary or the Sri Mahalakshmi gave is that she made the sun dance in the sky because people had asked for a sign to believe.

82
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
And she did that great miracle and many of the miracles that the Virgin did on that occasion.

83
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
But this was the most astonishing miracle. She made the sun dance in the sky.

84
00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:00.000
So when mother is dressed, you know, with this yellow and this purple, this has a great symbolic meaning for Portugal.

85
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
So we were just about to, we're taking all the suitcases out of that.

86
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:20.000
That photograph was taken at the place where she was staying in Portugal at that time when she came in 1982.

87
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:30.000
I was very new to Sathas then and we were taking the suitcases of that gentleman who was traveling with mother, Dr. Rustam.

88
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:39.000
We were taking those suitcases to the car to take mother to the airport. We were taking Sri Mataji's suitcases as well to the car to take mother to the airport.

89
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
And suddenly mother said, bring my suitcases back, you know.

90
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
So we were quite agitated about this rush for going to the airport.

91
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
And we brought Sri Mataji's suitcases back to the house. She said, put them on this table.

92
00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:06.000
And then she made an arrangement of saris for, and then she said, look, I promised this Sahaja Yogi there, one of them, that I was going to give him an art lesson, you know.

93
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000
And, you know, mother always keeps the promises. So she said, let's do the art lesson now.

94
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
And she used the saris to give an art lesson.

95
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:24.000
At the time, because I was very new, the main thing on my mind is who is Sri Mataji? Who is this lady Sri Mataji?

96
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Because I had such incredible experience when she gave me self-realization and after and at the meetings,

97
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.000
you know, I had already had an opportunity to rub mother's feet. She allowed me to do that, you know.

98
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.000
So the question really burning in my heart was who is this lady Sri Mataji?

99
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:51.000
And I asked the Sahaja Yogis, you know, do you think she's the Virgin Mary or do you think she's Christ or like Christ, you know.

100
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:59.000
But they would not answer the question. They would say, you know, there's a smile and you could feel the joy asking the question, but they just wouldn't answer me.

101
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Then I asked that Dr. Rustam was a great expert in Sahaja Yoga and Sanskrit and mantras.

102
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
I asked him, you know, who is this lady? Is she the Virgin Mary or something?

103
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:22.000
He said, well, you know, that's something you have to discover yourself, you know, because I wanted an answer to this question before mother goes back to London, you know, a kind of an official answer, you know.

104
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
But no, this is something you have to answer yourself.

105
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
So when mother started showing her saris, this was the question in my heart.

106
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Sometimes I was hardly listening to what mother was saying, only partly. In my mind was who is this lady? You know, is she really, you know, why don't they tell me, you know.

107
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:50.000
But while mother was showing the saris, I started feeling that this is the type of a dress for a goddess, really.

108
00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:06.000
This is like the dress for the Virgin Mary, really, those silk saris, you know, because the Virgin Mary, when they describe what was her dress, you know, people have those visions of the Virgin Mary in Fatima, in other places.

109
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:21.000
And what is the dress of the Virgin Mary? And this like this saris is something that the lady, the Virgin Mary is totally covered in silk, you know, or in the color is white or maybe pearl, pearl color.

110
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Sometimes they describe as having many, many, many colors as well, which is probably the visions of the chakras.

111
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:50.000
So and seeing those saris of mother, you know, with all the colors and, you know, the silk white pearl, pearl color and white color, you know, it was really, you know, my heart was telling me this really is the goddess, really.

112
00:22:51.000 --> 00:23:03.000
And it's not a doubt, it's me wanting some confirmation, but the saris were really speaking to me in that sense of this is the type of a dress for a goddess, really. Only a goddess can dress like this.

113
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:14.000
And Sri Mataji told us to look at the saris and now tell us, all of us, she was addressing that Sahaja Yogi wanted to be a professional artist.

114
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:24.000
She was addressing it mainly, but she told us, you know, look at the saris and tell me, and choose one that you like the most or maybe two, you know, so we all made our decision.

115
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:38.000
And then mother asked us one by one, she asked us, what's your favorite sari? You know, so mother was also finding out about our, you know, our, our feelings about the colors, really how we did react to these things.

116
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Because see mother likes to somehow also use the saris to please people so that we enjoyed meeting her the most.

117
00:23:48.000 --> 00:24:02.000
For instance, there was a Sahaja Yogini from France, you met, and she told us that story that mother was having a reception of French ladies, very important ladies, you know, coming to her house, diplomatic meeting, you know.

118
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:15.000
And so she asked his French Sahaja Yogini, come and see me at Brompton square where mother lives and help me choose a sari, you know, whichever sari would please the French ladies the most.

119
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:29.000
So they feel at home, they feel I'm like them, I'm one of them, you know, it's not a strange environment, you know, it's so mother wanted to wear a sari that the French ladies would like the most, you know.

120
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:38.000
So I think mother did the same for us in Portugal in the choice of saris that she chose, just like she did to those French ladies.

121
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000
And so mother was still talking about the saris and having found out which ones you like and which ones you don't.

122
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:58.000
Then she started directing our attention to the ones who didn't choose, most of us didn't choose a certain, a few saris that we know about that shows and mother went for those, you know, and started explaining the beauty of those patterns,

123
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:13.000
the beauty of the colors and telling that Sahaja Yogi that the patterns in the saris, some of them are very ideal patterns for using in ceramics, for instance, because they have a repetitive pattern and a certain rhythm.

124
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:36.000
And that would be something ideal for ceramics and mother was also telling him to put attention to the mother earth and learn about ceramics and work with the clay and that would awaken his creativity with the wake and awaken and also the innocence and the clearing of the Muladhara chakra.

125
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:45.000
And some of those motives in the Indian saris were created by people who are simple and work with the land.

126
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
So they have a very strong connection with the land, with the motherland, with the mother nature.

127
00:25:51.000 --> 00:26:00.000
And the mother nature gave a lot of the inspiration for the patterns that we find in the saris, especially those that were created by people who live in the villages.

128
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:15.000
And then later on other artists create, you know, and more sophisticated patterns, but every area of India has a different style of sari, but the nature is also different in different parts of India.

129
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:29.000
So there was a very strong relationship between the sari and the mother nature and the mother nature is something key for awake, to awake the creativity and the artistic spontaneity.

130
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
It was an incredible lesson mother gave to all of us on that occasion.

131
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:42.000
But my attention was really seeing those dresses and feeling this really is like the dresses for the goddess.

132
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:59.000
At another occasion, this was a lot later at Prompton Square, Srimataji was going through a box of jewelry to give, in fact, again, to give a lesson about jewelry to a certain size yogi who was learning about jewelry.

133
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
And she used their own jewelry to give that art lesson.

134
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:14.000
And I was looking at the jewelry and mother said, Louis, by the way, do you happen to know why is it that Indian ladies wear so much jewelry?

135
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:23.000
You know, well, I don't, I have no idea, you know, and mother said, that's because the goddess used to wear a lot of jewelry.

136
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000
You can see that when you read the mantras, you know, and the goddess always has to wear a sari.

137
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000
That's, you know, that's something it has to be like that.

138
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:41.000
And in India, all the ladies learn from their mothers that they have to also wear a lot of jewelry with the sari because the goddess also did.

139
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
So they have to follow the style of the goddess because they are devotees of the goddess.

140
00:27:46.000 --> 00:28:05.000
So mother had a tremendous respect for the sari really and for these traditions, so much so that on one occasion we all came to a puja.

141
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
I think it was Birmingham was it?

142
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000
Birmingham, yes.

143
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000
And suddenly the puja was about to start.

144
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
We were all dressed in our pajama quarters.

145
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
The ladies were dressed in their saris.

146
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Everything was ready. Mother was sitting on the stage and then mother asks, you know, do you have a sari for the puja?

147
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:33.000
And the leader said, well, as a matter of fact, the person bringing the sari got detained is a problem.

148
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
And mother said, okay, that's no problem.

149
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
But if there's no puja, if there's no sari, no puja.

150
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000
It's as simple as that.

151
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000
So why don't we do the puja the next day?

152
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.000
This was a big shock because we were all dressed and ready and some people don't like a change of plan.

153
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:56.000
But mother said, look, you know, don't be upset for the change of plan because this is a lot of fun.

154
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
It's nice to have a change of plan.

155
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
And now I'm going to enjoy myself, mother said.

156
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000
And she went to her handbag, got her glasses.

157
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000
And now I'm going to see how the ladies look so beautiful in their saris, you know,

158
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:16.000
and how the gentlemen also are looking so nice in their silks and pijama quarters and all that, you know.

159
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:24.000
And so they changed the lighting, you know, instead of the light being towards Shri Mataji on the stage to the yogi.

160
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
So mother could see the sari yogis now.

161
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:32.000
And she said she was really enjoying seeing all the ladies in their saris, how beautiful they look, you know.

162
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:39.000
So mother is always giving compliments to the Indian ladies or the size of the Guinness for wearing the saris.

163
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
She's very pleased when they do.

164
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:48.000
But as she said, you see, no sari, you know, if there's no sari, you cannot have a puja.

165
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000
These are very important traditions.

166
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
There was another puja this time.

167
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
It was in, where?

168
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Chelsea, I don't know.

169
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
I think it was in Hampstead.

170
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Hampstead, wasn't it?

171
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Can't remember the year, maybe 1985, I think.

172
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:14.000
And during the puja, she said, now the ladies who have never done a puja to me, they can come to the stage and do it.

173
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:20.000
And two ladies came, you know, dressed in jeans.

174
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000
They were wearing jeans, you know, they're not wearing a sari.

175
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000
And mother said, that's not possible, you know.

176
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:33.000
Someone should have given them saris or taught them how to wear a sari.

177
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000
It's not hard to find a sari in England, you know, because there are so many people from India, in England, you know.

178
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000
And someone was saying, really in future, make sure you teach all the new people.

179
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000
If they come to a puja, they should, the ladies especially, they must wear a sari.

180
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:55.000
And the gentleman also must wear this Indian Curtis, you know.

181
00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:08.000
And strangely enough, at this one set of tours, I was there with Carol and she said, now on the way back, you know, back to London, back to your countries,

182
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:16.000
especially the English going on the British Airways, that's their line used to be called the British Airways.

183
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:22.000
Make sure you wear your saris and your duties.

184
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Mother said, wear your duties, wear your saris, wear your pajama curtis and don't forget to wear also the red dot on the forehead, you know, the tikka.

185
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
So we did that because mother told us to do.

186
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:41.000
And then when you always, she also said, and when you go to work or when you go shopping, you know,

187
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:49.000
don't be afraid to wear the saris and to wear the pajama curtis, you know, just enjoy and wear the red dot on the forehead as well.

188
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000
So we did.

189
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:56.000
As we arrived in London, you know, there was some saja yogis there to collect us, you know,

190
00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:04.000
and they saw us coming of our flight all dressed up like that and they said, oh my God, have you gone mad or what?

191
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.000
You know, this is not allowed because are you behaving like the Hare Krishna people or what?

192
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:17.000
You know, this is not to be done, you know, but they didn't know.

193
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Well, mother told us to do that, you know, not just today, but whenever we want.

194
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000
And some people were saying, oh my goodness, this is the end of Sahaja Yoga now.

195
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000
This will definitely be the end of Sahaja Yoga.

196
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000
But Sahaja Yoga did not die really.

197
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:40.000
Some of us wore our whites, you know, I remember once going out shopping and I was going in my whites, you know,

198
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:49.000
and someone came to talk to me, oh, you must be a baker because I was dressed completely in white with a little white hat, you know, and the red dot.

199
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000
And they said, you must be a baker, you know, I'm sorry.

200
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.000
I mean, I'm not a baker, but I have a photograph of this lady Shrimant.

201
00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:08.000
We talked about Sahaja and we laughed a lot, you know, you know, it's a really strange thing to be confused with the bakers because all in white, you know, those whites, you know,

202
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:18.000
Caro also went to for a job interview wearing a sari, you know, she didn't get the job, but she knew she wasn't going to get the job in any case.

203
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
She was not qualified for that job.

204
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:32.000
She was going just for practice interview to practice for another interview where she thought she had a better chance, you know, but she even went for a job interview wearing a sari.

205
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
So many Sahaja Yogis did that.

206
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Nothing happened really.

207
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000
There was no problem.

208
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:47.000
You know, people are not afraid of the saris, you know, there were occasions where Caro went to, we went to the airport because mother was coming or going.

209
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:58.000
And on those on a few occasions, Caro decided to wear a sari to go and see Maduretti Airport and some.

210
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:10.000
Some English Sahaja Yoginis were telling telling her, you know, if she don't currently, you know, you must be a little bit crazy to come dressed in a sari because this is an airport.

211
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:16.000
And as you can see, no one else is doing that except maybe one or two Indian Sahaja Yoginis who lived in England.

212
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:35.000
So, you know, that's really are you not worried that mother might tell you off or something and kind of felt, no, I don't see why, you know, and the fact the mother was very pleased that she came dressed in a sari and spoke to her, you know, and everything went beautifully.

213
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Mother was not at all displeased on the contrary.

214
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:46.000
And she did that a few more times and still other people who didn't know came to tell her, Caro, are you going bonkers or what?

215
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Coming dressed with a sari.

216
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000
This is not the push.

217
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Are you getting confused?

218
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000
This is the airport, you know, and she did a few times really.

219
00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:02.000
So there was a certain fear of this type of clothes, you know, but there's something very special.

220
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000
Mother kept explaining these things to everybody.

221
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:11.000
So one day I came all the way from Portugal, especially to meet Shri Mataji.

222
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:29.000
And I had been in London maybe about three weeks, I think, waiting for a chance to see mother really if there's a chance, if mother gives a public program or a push or an invitation of some kind, I was staying staying at maybe mother might come to the ashram at Chelsea Road, you know, this was 1983.

223
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:57.000
So I was waiting for a chance and then an invitation came mother is going to see a sari fashion show, you know, everybody's welcome, you know, so to see a, you know, a show of saris, you know, where the some ladies come from India, and they know how to model the saris and display the saris and show them and mother went to see that and told us invited everybody come and see the message came rather late.

224
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:10.000
When you got the message, so you knew we cannot arrive on time. It's impossible. Although you're running all the way to the tube and after the tube, you were running all over the place trying to reach the place as early as possible.

225
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.000
We were late, really.

226
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:24.000
So when I arrived there at that center, it was a big exhibition about the products that I exported from India and the sari is a very important export from India, of course, all over the world.

227
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:35.000
And so we couldn't find mother anywhere and you were running around that place with three different floors, you know, and we just couldn't find mother anyway.

228
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000
And in the end mother appeared that long after a long time and by then you were exhausted.

229
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000
And we asked mother, where were you? I didn't ask another sari yogi was with me.

230
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Where were you? We couldn't find you anywhere. Mother says, where else could I be? Watching the saris fashion show, there's really nothing else to see here.

231
00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:03.000
This is the most important thing. Make sure you don't miss seeing this because these ladies are so beautiful.

232
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:10.000
We're modeling the saris so beautiful, so innocent, so sweet, so elegant, so dignified.

233
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:18.000
What a beautiful thing you really should see this, you know, don't miss it because there was a show on the hour, every hour another show starts, you know.

234
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:27.000
So at all times mother was showing tremendous respect for the saris and she herself enjoyed seeing people wearing saris also.

235
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:37.000
And I've noticed that all saris yoginis are quite enthusiastic about seeing mother dressed in the sari, how well mother looks.

236
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:43.000
Sometimes we are watching a video at home, me and Carl and Carl said, can you rewind the beginning?

237
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:49.000
She wants to see mother entering on the stage, wearing a beautiful sari. Sometimes it's just a white sari even.

238
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:55.000
And oh, how beautiful. Can you rewind again? I want to see mother coming, you know, and mother comes dressed in that sari.

239
00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000
It's something, it's like a vision of a God that's coming onto the stage. Everybody feels that.

240
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:11.000
So saja yoginis are very enthusiastic about mother and her saris, but mother is also appreciative of when the saja yoginis wear the saris.

241
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:21.000
So on the Indian tour, we were there, you know, to get married again. Mother had already arranged our marriage and now we're going to get married in England first.

242
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000
And now mother told us to come to India to get a sahaja marriage as well.

243
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:39.000
And then the message came mother is going to select the saris for the brides, you know, so gentlemen, please make sure you come, you know, and bring your wallets, you know, so it's your chance to buy the sari for your bride.

244
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:45.000
You know, so everybody came to see mother buying the saris or choosing the saris for the brides.

245
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:58.000
And the mother being such an expert on the saris, you know, there was a whole truck full of saris, you know, someone drove a full truck full of saris.

246
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000
It was thousands of saris there to choose from.

247
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:13.000
And because mother is such an expert, mother went through the whole consignment of saris at fast speed, you know, fast, fast, fast, because she just knows, she doesn't even have to touch it.

248
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:21.000
She knows immediately what is a good sari, what's not a good sari and sometimes she would approve a sari.

249
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000
Most of them should reject and then she would touch it and see it and then check the price.

250
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000
If the price was not right, she would reject the sari straight away.

251
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:42.000
So mother was careful to keep save our money as well, you know, so what took care and attention mother put into those saris and what expertise, how she could go through.

252
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.000
Thousands of saris at such speed and then she created, it's quite complicated.

253
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000
She had several piles of saris she approved for the brides.

254
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.000
There were three piles of, you know, lower price, medium price and more expensive.

255
00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:03.000
Then there was a pile of saris for people who want to buy a really expensive sari to take home for their mothers or for their aunt.

256
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
So it's a very, very special gift.

257
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:20.000
Then there were other piles of saris for daily use during the tour, you know, so simple, you know, and then another pile of saris for going to pushes or going to programs during the tour for those who need.

258
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.000
So what a complex thing, mother was dealing with so many piles of saris, but she's a top expert.

259
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:32.000
She knew more about it than the man was selling the saris, you know, it was incredible.

260
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:42.000
Let's see. Oh, yes. One day at mother's house, I happened to be the only saja yogi there and another one.

261
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:57.000
So there was two of us and that day mother had to go to a very important diplomatic conference and mother had a domestic assistant who was a man, really a young man like us, our same age as us, but it's a man really.

262
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:04.000
And he was in charge of ironing mother's saris, you know, because he was doing all the domestic assistance and cooking as well.

263
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:13.000
And we had seen him ironing mother's saris sometimes, you know, because we were dead on the basement sometimes and that's the place where he used to do it.

264
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:31.000
So we had seen him doing, but we didn't know how to iron a sari, but that day was ill, you know, so mother looked at us and the time was ticking now, so she'd be coming at any moment, you know, to pick her up with the limousine to that special, very special event, you know.

265
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:39.000
And so mother looked at us and said, can you iron me a sari? You said, of course, mother, no problem. You know, full of confidence.

266
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:51.000
The problem is that none of us have ever ironed the saris. And this was a very special sari for a very important event, you know, in the evening.

267
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:57.000
So we knew this is quite a rather very special sari, very expensive as well.

268
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:05.000
It would be a big shame if you burn this sari or do a really bad job and put wrinkles on the sari and spoil the whole thing, you know.

269
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:20.000
But we asked mother to help, although mother wasn't there. She was upstairs in the rooms and the sari got ironed, you know, and on this occasion, we really, you know, got to see the sari.

270
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:32.000
And in great detail and the patterns and everything, quite very interesting, you know, usually we don't notice in such great detail, but ironing the sari gave that experience.

271
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:49.000
But we noticed we were really getting thoughtless while ironing the sari. It was a special experience, you know, something I only did once in my life, but it felt special really to pass the test because there was a good chance we burn the sari or make a mess of it.

272
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:55.000
But everything went well. Mother was guiding us and helping us. And then mother wore the sari.

273
00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:04.000
And we may not notice so much when mother is wearing a sari, you know, because we are talking to her and we forget to look at the sari even sometimes.

274
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:13.000
But on that occasion, we really saw the sari, you know, how amazing mother looked in that special sari for going out for a special diplomatic conference.

275
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:26.000
And my wife, Carol, she used to complain sometimes when I come, having seen mother, you know, then she wants to know everything mother said or what happened, what people are doing and saying.

276
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:32.000
And I used to try and remember everything mother said and people said and what was happening to tell her everything in great detail.

277
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.000
Next day, she would ask me to tell the same story again and the next day and the next day.

278
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:47.000
This actually helps me to remember things sometimes. But the first thing Carol always asked me is what was the color of the sari, you know, mother was wearing it.

279
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:57.000
Oh, I don't know. I didn't see. What a disaster. I forgot to see the color of the sari mother was wearing.

280
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:10.000
And Carol used to be, oh my God, you didn't see the color of the sari, but you know, don't do this to me, please. Next time, at least know that at least tell me the color of the sari, you know, minimum, if not a bit more detail, you know.

281
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:19.000
All right. So that's the one time I was able to describe the sari very in great detail because we are in that sari and we saw mother wearing it straight away.

282
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:37.000
So we could not fail to notice that. So that was an interesting event, but a lot happened in that event because then when mother ultimately, you know, mother went down the steps, you know, and this mother was going down the steps wearing that sari.

283
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:54.000
I got the kind of a vision, you know, that mother was gliding on a cloud, you know, like a divine, you know, which she is of course, but usually you see mother more as a human person, you know, but she seemed to be gliding on a cloud going down the stairs, going into the car.

284
00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:07.000
And that was an incredible vision, you know, a special moment that still today I remember because usually we don't get this type of feeling, you know, it's, you know, we're in the present, there's no vision is that's what it is.

285
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:15.000
But the whole sari event seemed to have had an effect on us. We felt very thoughtless whilst while ironing it, ironing it.

286
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:28.000
And then when mother went and left the home, you know, it was like a divine vision, seeing mother gliding down the stairs as if she was going on a cloud almost, but that's just me trying to put it into words that feeling.

287
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.000
I'm sorry.

288
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Because of the timing.

289
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:43.000
Yes, the timing. The timing was incredible because, but that I think we leave those details for another time. There was something else happened at that moment.

290
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
No, tell us now.

291
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000
Well, I mean, it's a, it's a diversion.

292
00:45:49.000 --> 00:46:09.000
Is that this boy that used to iron mothers, saris was, um, um, but as a domestic assistant, uh, it first came to sahaja in India and he was very ill because he was working in an, in a factory for with the chemicals for, for make for manufacturing medicine.

293
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000
So from, from young age, he did that job. We had, he nailed so many chemicals.

294
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000
He was really very sick and now he could not work.

295
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
So mother gave him realization.

296
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:24.000
And then, uh, mother told him also, I think you better find a different job, you know, but, um, it was not easy for him to find a different job.

297
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000
I think even his parents, you know, depending on, depended a bit on his income.

298
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:33.000
Uh, you know, it's very hard to know to find a new career and your job and everything.

299
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000
So we asked mother, really mother, please, uh, can you give me a job?

300
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:47.000
You know, I think he must have assumed mother had lots of jobs because size yoga is a big organization and people don't realize that, uh, you know, people don't get paid on jobs going in size yoga.

301
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.000
But you really mother, please, you know, please, can you give me a job?

302
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000
You know, and mother said, uh, what are the profession would you like to do?

303
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000
You know, he said, cooking.

304
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000
Oh, do you know how to cook?

305
00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000
No.

306
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000
I said, well, I can teach you how to cook.

307
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:11.000
And mother taught him how to cook professionally, you know, in two weeks, you know, and mother used to be very proud of that, that he learned to cook everything perfectly in two weeks.

308
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:16.000
You know, only people who can go topless can, you know, learn so much so fast.

309
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000
And mother was also very proud of strong.

310
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:27.000
He was, he had become, you have become so strong, you know, he was a vegetarian by the way, and always remained a vegetarian, but still he was so strong.

311
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000
He was stronger than all of us.

312
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:35.000
So mother was proud of that, that, you know, how much he improved, you know, while he was there working for mother.

313
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000
But the only problem is that he still felt very sick with nausea.

314
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:47.000
If every had to go on a car or on a bus or tube, anything, it's just could not go on a, on transport to get very sick.

315
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:55.000
So he had gone out that day, you know, and now he was missing and mother knew he's feeling very sick, you know, so mother was very worried about him.

316
00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:07.000
She didn't want to go out for the, for this conference without seeing him first, because he's, you know, she knew that when he gets very sick, because he had to go out to meet some friends or acquaintances.

317
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000
And it was, it was getting so late and he's still missing and mother, mother knows what people are feeling.

318
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:20.000
She knew he's feeling very sick and now he has to walk a long, long distance because he's not going to go on a, on a bus or anything because of nausea.

319
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000
So he has to walk a huge distance.

320
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.000
He's going to be exhausted.

321
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:32.000
And mother was, mother said, you know, I really don't want to go to this conference now, but it's my duty and I always do.

322
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.000
What's my duty, you know?

323
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000
So it looks like mother also needed a miracle now.

324
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000
And that's what happened.

325
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.000
Mother was standing there, all dressed, ready to go and suddenly arrives.

326
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:47.000
So mother goes and meets him outside the, outside the front entrance immediately.

327
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000
And, you know, works on him.

328
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000
You know, this is outside the house on the front door.

329
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000
And she raises Kundalini, puts it in Bandhan, gives Bandhan on his Navi.

330
00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Mother talked to him in Hindi or Marathi.

331
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000
I don't know what language mother was talking.

332
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.000
And so then he went home.

333
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000
Mother, you know, suddenly he was looking normal.

334
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:11.000
He was not looking like a ghost because he was so exhausted of walking and nausea.

335
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000
He was looking fantastic.

336
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.000
You know what mother can do in a second or two there.

337
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000
And as mother finished working on him, immediately the limousine arrived.

338
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000
What a tremendous timing you see.

339
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:28.000
So mother went to the mother did exactly what she wanted to do to look after this, this boy, you know?

340
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.000
And then the car arrived and she went absolutely perfect timing.

341
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:39.000
And that's partly why it felt like we knew this is divinely orchestrated this event.

342
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000
Parking studies.

343
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.000
Yes.

344
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:50.000
At Shuddhi camps mother was by then going to go to Italy and to Pratistan and she was moving.

345
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.000
She was selling.

346
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:57.000
In fact, she was selling Shuddhi camps, which was a house and also an ashram.

347
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:06.000
And so she had to pack everything to, you know, either to Pratistan or to Kebala or keep some of the some stuff.

348
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000
She was still keeping with her because she was still living there.

349
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:17.000
She had not yet sold, but it takes a lot of preparation to pack everything to go on a shipping container really.

350
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.000
And there was a lot to do.

351
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000
Mother was absolutely relaxed about it.

352
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000
You know, I think most people go crazy.

353
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:30.000
Oh my God to pack everything, you know, what and mother is so busy doing lots of international tours all the time.

354
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.000
And mother was so relaxed about it as if it's nothing.

355
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000
This is something so easy.

356
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.000
It's of no importance.

357
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.000
It's easy to do.

358
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:44.000
So some ladies came to help and there was also plenty of men to help.

359
00:50:45.000 --> 00:51:09.000
And the hardest job was the crockery because the crockery every time we went into the room bringing boxes and more boxes and boxes of crockery and the teacups and plates, you know, we almost broke, you know, you were at danger of breaking everything the way we walk and go and come, you know, and mother used to say, Oh my goodness, we don't want a bull in a China shop, you know, so this was an English saying.

360
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.000
So it was a joke.

361
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000
So we knew about that.

362
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000
And then mother said, all right.

363
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:18.000
I think the boys are going to help me to pack the saris and the ladies can do the crockery on their own.

364
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.000
They don't need supervision.

365
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000
They can do we need supervision of course.

366
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:36.000
So mother started the packing a saris and we had to bring lots of suitcases who love saris and open and open of suitcases show the saris to mother and some suitcases would not open.

367
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000
You have the we had tried everything.

368
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.000
There were four suitcases.

369
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000
We could not open.

370
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.000
They have a lock with three wheels.

371
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:48.000
So it's a three digit combination and mother knew and told us the code is 108.

372
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:54.000
So just try 108 and all the suitcases open except for four because they were old.

373
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.000
They were rusty.

374
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000
The mechanism is jammed.

375
00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.000
Maybe, you know, we tried all numbers, you know, even other combinations.

376
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.000
We tried 777, 111, 000.

377
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.000
They just wouldn't open, you know, someone said, let me see, you know, we had the rest.

378
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:14.000
We had already played with those wheels and tried to make them lose.

379
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:22.000
So mother started rubbing the wheels of the suitcase, those wheels, which are the code, the lock, the lock mechanism.

380
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:32.000
Mother would rub those wheels while talking to us and doing other things, you know, as if she's playing, paying no attention to that, you know, and then she said, okay, you can try now.

381
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.000
And so we would go back, you know, put back the 108 and there you go.

382
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.000
Now it opens.

383
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.000
You see, it's amazing what mother can do with vibrations.

384
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:54.000
And she opened three suitcases like this that we had tried and tried and tried just by rubbing her hands and the vibrations on those wheels, you know, and then came out the last one could do a four and mother tried the same, but it's just been open, you know?

385
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:59.000
So we're looking at mother saying, oh my goodness, you know, now it's not working.

386
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:03.000
So, well, we can get the screwdriver, you know, or a hammer and scissor.

387
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000
We'll crack this, you know, there's no problem.

388
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000
We'll get the series out, you know, I said, no, no, no, no, wait, wait.

389
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000
You know, is there a label?

390
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.000
Oh yes, there's a label.

391
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.000
What does it say?

392
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.000
Kalpana.

393
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.000
Oh, there you go.

394
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:25.000
See, I'm not meant to open the vibrations, you know, respect all the dharmas and everything, even the vibrations didn't open the suitcase because it was not mother's suitcase.

395
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.000
It was Kalpana's, you know?

396
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000
So we have a good laugh with this.

397
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:40.000
But while you were packing the series with mother, mother was talking about the tours because she had been mother's constant, the on a tour and she was updating us about the status of Sahaja Yoga in the world, you know?

398
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:48.000
So it's not just about packing, packing series mother's talking of all sorts of things to us while you are bringing the series.

399
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:56.000
And meanwhile, mother is telling the story goes in this box that one goes in that box, you know, and there were lots of different boxes for different types of series.

400
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000
We didn't know where to put the series.

401
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:03.000
In fact, only mother knew what the different boxes were, what types of series or whatever.

402
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Or if I go into India or Kebel or staying there in London, in Cambridge, in the shitty camps, we didn't know what we were doing.

403
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000
We were just bringing series to mother.

404
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:24.000
And we had to wait, you know, our turn because let's say I was standing there with my hands, you know, open towards the mother and three series of mother on my hands, you know?

405
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.000
And the hands were going very, very cool, very cool, very cool.

406
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:33.000
You know, it was like we were clearing out with this and then at last mother would say, okay, this sorry goes here.

407
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.000
This one goes there.

408
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.000
Oh, let me see this.

409
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:36.000
Sorry. Okay.

410
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.000
Don't put it yet.

411
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:41.000
So mother would look at the sorry then she would show us the side itself beautiful in this pattern.

412
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:52.000
And this senior, the story of all the sizes, you know, she told us so much about the service and she kept talking that maybe we, you know, we should have a museum, you know, of service.

413
00:54:52.000 --> 00:55:02.000
It's such an important art from India and we could see the salaries are precious because just holding them in our hands, the hands go totally cold, you know, incredible thing.

414
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000
She knew all the side is, Oh, there were so many sizes.

415
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.000
Oh, this one is from CCP.

416
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.000
You know, you gave me this one.

417
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.000
Let me see.

418
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.000
And she would see it again.

419
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.000
She hadn't seen it for a while.

420
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:16.000
You know, how beautiful, you know, so many studies that they would, that would, you know, gifts from CCP probably chosen by mother.

421
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:20.000
So, you know, it's really, although it was a gift from CCP.

422
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:30.000
Sometimes you would give also on its own without as a surprise without mother choosing the sorry somewhere or select that, you know, not chosen by mother, but chosen by CCP.

423
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.000
But how wonderful mother knew the story of all the sorrys.

424
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:38.000
She was always showing us for us to enjoy the patterns, the colors, the beauty.

425
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:42.000
It was another art class, art class really about the sorrys.

426
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:46.000
And she was saying that, you know, it's worth having a museum of sorrys really.

427
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Yes. And then suddenly another box came, which was not sorrys, you know, it was actually mother's shoes, but we didn't know what it was.

428
00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:02.000
So that box of shoes was also put there for mother to sort out, you know, and I said, Oh no, that's too cold.

429
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:11.000
That's too cold. Keep it a little bit to the side, you know, it's too cold, you know, and ultimately another person came because they were coming and going to the attic to get the suitcases.

430
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:18.000
You know, he didn't know what mother said that, you know, it's not sorrys, you know, and again, he brought that box to mother, mother, what do you do with this box?

431
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000
You know, Oh, all right, let's, let's open it.

432
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.000
So mother opened the lid of that box.

433
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:28.000
It was shoes, mother's shoes, old, already old, mother was not wearing those.

434
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:34.000
And the vibrations were so amazing that even mother said, Oh my goodness, this is incredible.

435
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:44.000
You know, mother was amazed how strong the vibrations were from the box that were coming out and mother stopped the work.

436
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.000
You know, we stopped those.

437
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:51.000
We put all our sorrys back, the suitcases and mother went into meditation and said, Oh, this is incredible.

438
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000
You know, what vibrations can you feel this?

439
00:56:53.000 --> 00:57:00.000
You know, so we sat down, we sat down, you know, mother said, you can close your eyes if you want mother also close the rise, close our eyes.

440
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.000
And we went into meditation.

441
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000
It was unforgettable.

442
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:11.000
So although there were several days of packing saris with mother, this is the one day I remember because of this meditation.

443
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:30.000
So packing saris with mother is not a mundane thing, you know, because mother is telling her the whole about our tours or how Sahaj is spreading in the world, what's happening in this country, that country, you know, and giving us so many art lessons with the saris.

444
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:36.000
And then it ends up, ends up, you know, our hands get totally cleansed while holding those saris on our hands.

445
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:48.000
And then we have an incredible meditation with mother, which is quite rare because usually we don't close our eyes, you know, in the presence of mother or mother doesn't close her eyes also, not often at least.

446
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:58.000
And that was a really amazing meditation session with mother that I don't think I will ever forget this.

447
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.000
So now a little story from Carol.

448
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:17.000
So at the tour, Carol was wearing a sari and again, mother said, Oh, you know, you look so Indian, you look so Indian, you know, well, which is not surprising because she's wearing a sari, but no, no, you know, you really look very Indian mother said to her, how do you explain that?

449
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:23.000
And for the first time, mother, Carol told mother, mother, actually I was born in India.

450
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:28.000
Oh, so only now you tell me, but you've been telling me you came from Sheffield.

451
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.000
I've asked you so many times, you tell me you came from Sheffield.

452
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000
That's because she got realization in Sheffield.

453
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:38.000
Sometimes you tell me that you came from Brighton.

454
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:45.000
At the time I've asked you where you came from and you tell me you came from Lewis because she was staying in a town called Lewis, which is also my name by the way.

455
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:49.000
But she, you know, you tell me you came from Lewis, from Brighton.

456
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:59.000
And by the way, I knew you don't come from those places because human beings are like flowers or plants, you know, wherever they are born, that's their natural environment.

457
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:10.000
And it's written, it's inside of them, you know, like a plant, you know, belongs to a place you may move, of course, wherever you may move, but whatever you are, where you are born, it's also written inside you.

458
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:29.000
So I knew that you were not from Sheffield or Cardiff or Lewis or Brighton, you know, you know, what took you so long to tell me that you were born in India, you know, the fact that you were born in India actually is a great blessing that helped you to find such a very important thing.

459
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:37.000
So Carol could have told mother that she was actually born in India, but mother knows everything.

460
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000
This is what's so incredible.

461
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:45.000
Let me see if I forget any stories here.

462
00:59:45.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Oh, yes. I think last one maybe because on the previous session about saris, it was very mentioned, how slow ashram and mother was mother was also packing a saris into a box and locking it, you know, mother used to you know, all those studies were locked in suitcases or somewhere else in cupboards and drawers.

463
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:13.000
But the thing is that certain things were disappearing at the house last time.

464
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
So there was a thief.

465
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
There's no doubt about it.

466
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.000
That was serious, you know, important ceramics or being stolen.

467
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Even such yogis felt some things are missing, you know, lots of things were disappearing.

468
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:32.000
So mother, some people knew there's a thief here and mother said, don't worry, we'll catch the thief.

469
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
You know, we'll catch him, you know, meanwhile.

470
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Meanwhile, you know, if you don't leave valuables lying around, you know, lock them or, you know, because that also helps, you know, you should not, you know, leave things lying around like that, you know, and but I said, don't worry, we'll catch the thief, you know, and they were also running a public

471
01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:03.000
And but I said, don't worry, we'll catch the thief, you know, and they were also running a public meeting next to the ashram.

472
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:14.000
So new people sometimes will go to ashram, you know, we've got realization, you know, and then when the mother's there and the mother saw the person, okay, she knew this is the thief because the mother knows everything.

473
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:23.000
So mother challenged him, even if realized that mother knows everything, you know, it's incredible, you know, so he confessed, he confessed.

474
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:43.000
He confessed and he promised to bring the stuff back, you know, otherwise mother would have to report him to the police, you know, but he confessed, you know, I promised to bring the stuff back, you know, we never heard of him again, but mother knew she can, you know, she can find that she can catch the thief if she wants to.

475
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:51.000
So there he was, it's a little extra towards that story that Fergie said, you know, when he showed that photo of mother, you know.

476
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000
I think that's all the stories I was going to say today.

477
01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Sorry?

478
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
What do you want to say about the ramp?

479
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
About?

480
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
The ramp?

481
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
I can hear.

482
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
The lady, the dream?

483
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Oh, yes, you know, I could, you see, maybe if Caroline could show that photograph, which I called it Portuguese holidays, I called it.

484
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
The square steps.

485
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Caroline, I don't know if she can hear.

486
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Yeah, I'm listening.

487
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000
I'm just one of the photographs is called Portuguese holidays.

488
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Yeah.

489
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:46.000
So throughout my childhood, we always used to spend the holidays in this place, you know, this is a farm and there's a big ramp going from the farm all the way to the to the road to the public road.

490
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.000
This is not in the village is a bit away from the village.

491
01:02:51.000 --> 01:03:03.000
So and in the village, there's always traditionally there has to be a procession of the Virgin Mary processions with Christ, you know, all the traditional processions were inside the village.

492
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:10.000
So they wouldn't come near our home, which is in a little bit slightly remote place and also a very high place with a big ramp to reach.

493
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000
But I have this dream in childhood, which was a recurrent dream.

494
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000
So every year during summer, I would have this dream two or three times.

495
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:26.000
And in the dream, there's, you know, the sound of a procession, the drums very loud and that wakes me up.

496
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:31.000
So then I come from the house to see what it is to the beginning of the ramp.

497
01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
It's a dream.

498
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000
It's not a real vision, you know, and then the process would come all the way there.

499
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Leading the procession, there was a Divine Lady because she was, you know, moving on the cloud, you know, going up the ramp, you know, and the procession was coming with her playing the music.

500
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Then upon arriving at the end of the ramp, she would say, well, I'm here, you know, you have asked me to come, you prayed for me to come.

501
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:05.000
So if you want to come join the procession, you know, you are invited to come if you want, you know.

502
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:10.000
And then everybody would do a prostration to the lady.

503
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:17.000
And there were some angels throwing some flowers at the feet of the lady.

504
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:27.000
And then the lady would turn around and go down the ramp again, you know, because now she has to go and meet the people who also, you know, have been calling her or praying for her to come.

505
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000
And so she came.

506
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
So this was a recurrent dream.

507
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000
It stopped when I became 15, 16 years old, the dream stopped.

508
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
So it really is just a childhood dream.

509
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.000
And I'm not saying this is the Virgin Mary because it's just a dream.

510
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000
I'm not even saying this was Shri Mataji for sure.

511
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.000
But to me, you know, I want to set it aside, you know, as something from childhood.

512
01:04:49.000 --> 01:05:02.000
But that day when mother, you know, was wearing that sari, you know, going to that important function, you know, and I felt mother was just gliding down the steps, you know, as if she was going on a cloud.

513
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:12.000
That's the only time, you know, the mother brought this memory to me of this recurrent childhood dream that I used to have every summer during holiday.

514
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:23.000
So that is why I still remember that story of that sari because it brought back something to me, which was something precious, a nice memory from childhood.

515
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Was there any other story?

516
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Well, just to finish, I mean, this is not so important.

517
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:49.000
If you want to show the last two photos, there's one of our marriage in India.

518
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:56.000
There you go, Carl also made sure she chose a green sari for me because the green flag may be.

519
01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000
I don't think it's a coincidence again.

520
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
But it was one of the saris that mother selected for the bride.

521
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Oh, yes, this is one of the saris selected by mother for the bride, you know, medium price, by the way.

522
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
So there were three categories.

523
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Carl took pity on my wallet.

524
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000
And but the beautiful sari and again, green.

525
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:30.000
And then there's the last one here of a car by the river on the Indian tour.

526
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
That's it. So again, this is one of those.

527
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
You can see the white sari with a red border.

528
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:40.000
These are also saris selected by Srimataji and the little shawl.

529
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
This was a gift Srimataji gave to all of us.

530
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Even the man got a slightly different shawl, but you know, we also got a red shawl given by mother.

531
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Everybody got a shawl.

532
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:56.000
But these are beautiful traditional Indian shawls also with the same patterns,

533
01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000
like the saris and this white sari with a red border.

534
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:07.000
It's very typical of those saris mother was selecting for the ladies on the tour.

535
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:12.000
The ones for daily use is not one of the special ones, of course.

536
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000
But there you are. It's another nice memory.

537
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.000
And I think that's all the stories I have.

538
01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000
There's just one photograph left of Brompton Square.

539
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
I think I'll just share it.

540
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Okay.

541
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:41.000
So this is the place where mother came here to meet her assistant, the domestic assistant, let's call him.

542
01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
And that's where mother worked on him.

543
01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:49.000
And once she finished working on him, as soon as she finished working on him,

544
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:55.000
the Delhi Museum arrived and mother's rest was gliding down to the car.

545
01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000
It brought back that vision to me.

546
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.000
So I cannot forget those events, of course.

547
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:08.000
But that's it. Thank you for your time and patience with me.

548
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000
That's all the stories I have for today.

549
01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Well, thank you so much, Lewis.

550
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
It's been wonderful.

551
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.000
It's been absolutely a joy to listen to you and to prayer this evening.

552
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000
So I'm going to just stop the recording now.
