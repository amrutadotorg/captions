1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,270
In the most auspicious time

2
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:18,187
that is called as Krita Yuga,

3
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:23,603
we all have assembled here

4
00:00:25,117 --> 00:00:32,033
to understand the ways and methods

5
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:40,957
of establishing our Principle of a Master.

6
00:00:45,638 --> 00:00:48,972
Krita Yuga.

7
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:15,453
“Krita Yuga” means the time

8
00:01:17,098 --> 00:01:19,889
when you have to do something –

9
00:01:20,264 --> 00:01:22,555
“krita: when it was done.”

10
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,338
So you are the channels of that doing,

11
00:01:46,248 --> 00:01:49,248
doing the work of God.

12
00:01:52,547 --> 00:01:57,274
You are the channels of God Almighty and His Power.

13
00:02:06,184 --> 00:02:14,225
On one side you have to carry the dignity,

14
00:02:14,654 --> 00:02:19,695
the glory, and the assumption that you are a guru.

15
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:37,249
On the other side you have to be completely surrendered

16
00:02:37,529 --> 00:02:40,613
to your God Almighty.

17
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:53,753
All your dignity, your authority comes from Him.

18
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,846
And the third thing is

19
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:08,433
that the way He has created this universe and you,

20
00:03:09,187 --> 00:03:10,250
in a mood of play,

21
00:03:15,117 --> 00:03:17,665
you have to see His play.

22
00:03:28,718 --> 00:03:34,344
So a kind of mood that is cheerfulness

23
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,975
should be really bubbling through you.

24
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:51,813
So far the idea of guru was

25
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,882
that such a person never laughs, never smiles,

26
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:57,740
always in a temper.

27
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,124
That was all right for gurus

28
00:04:05,457 --> 00:04:08,838
who did not have to have any contact with the public,

29
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:10,900
but hanged themselves with a string

30
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,566
somewhere in the Himalayas.

31
00:04:21,707 --> 00:04:25,582
But here we are, facing

32
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,287
the entire universe that has to receive

33
00:04:32,627 --> 00:04:35,585
the bubbling streams of your love.

34
00:04:46,468 --> 00:04:49,216
But that does not mean that you have to be frivolous,

35
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:51,392
because you cannot be.

36
00:04:57,707 --> 00:05:00,499
The divine play is not frivolous,

37
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,962
it is joyful,

38
00:05:06,415 --> 00:05:09,373
and the joy does not have that duality.

39
00:05:16,253 --> 00:05:22,082
So to get to the establishment of your Guru Principle,

40
00:05:22,282 --> 00:05:26,124
first we should know how it is destroyed.

41
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:42,730
As it is, anything that is not looked after

42
00:05:42,957 --> 00:05:46,124
or maintained gets destroyed.

43
00:05:56,775 --> 00:05:58,830
If we do not pay attention,

44
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:04,333
say, to these beautiful plants here, they will be destroyed.

45
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:17,048
Even matter which is not attended to gets destroyed.

46
00:06:21,911 --> 00:06:27,494
So first of all, we have to know that we must be attentive

47
00:06:32,582 --> 00:06:36,374
and alert that if we do not maintain ourselves,

48
00:06:36,632 --> 00:06:38,160
we’ll be destroyed.

49
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,647
Because maintenance is not for maintenance sake,

50
00:06:53,385 --> 00:07:00,885
it is for stopping the destruction of your Guru Principle.

51
00:07:08,797 --> 00:07:12,131
When we are negligent or lazy about it,

52
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:16,381
we are responsible for destroying our Guru Principle.

53
00:07:24,874 --> 00:07:28,208
So the attention that we have

54
00:07:28,468 --> 00:07:33,635
is to be given to the maintenance of this Guru Principle.

55
00:07:43,457 --> 00:07:50,999
The gurus have the capacity to maintain themselves

56
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:54,374
and maintain others.

57
00:08:02,953 --> 00:08:08,494
In the beginning, when the gurus tried to establish

58
00:08:08,752 --> 00:08:13,752
this maintenance principle,

59
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:19,078
they put very, very strong rules and regulations.

60
00:08:33,087 --> 00:08:40,339
If you read Bible in the Levi chapter,

61
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:44,075
you will find all the shariats that are described,

62
00:08:44,313 --> 00:08:47,299
which they are following now in Riyadh

63
00:08:47,499 --> 00:08:50,582
or in the Arabic countries.

64
00:09:05,373 --> 00:09:11,582
To maintain that principle within yourself,

65
00:09:12,336 --> 00:09:14,461
it’s written in such strong languages,

66
00:09:14,749 --> 00:09:17,193
like “Such a person who does not do this

67
00:09:17,412 --> 00:09:19,829
should be killed to death.

68
00:09:28,786 --> 00:09:32,652
Such a person does anything wrong of this kind

69
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:35,624
should be killed by stoning.”

70
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:45,707
That was at the very beginning, so the people now

71
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:51,385
at that stage of evolution required that kind of a fear.

72
00:09:57,832 --> 00:10:02,499
This was not meant to in any way to insult or to harm,

73
00:10:02,737 --> 00:10:06,237
or to take away the freedom of human beings.

74
00:10:13,695 --> 00:10:18,561
But it was meant for people

75
00:10:18,832 --> 00:10:23,056
to give a great idea of the importance

76
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:26,291
of the Principle of Guru within themselves.

77
00:10:34,437 --> 00:10:39,646
At that stage they used the frightening methods,

78
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:45,594
I should say – horribly dangerous times.

79
00:10:51,536 --> 00:10:54,619
And that time people obeyed also.

80
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:04,954
Then another evolutionary state took place

81
00:11:05,154 --> 00:11:10,219
where a stage started,

82
00:11:10,924 --> 00:11:14,798
people thought they must become austere,

83
00:11:15,171 --> 00:11:19,499
and start maintaining themselves by tremendous austerity.

84
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:21,576
So it was self-projected;

85
00:11:21,776 --> 00:11:23,747
it was not projected towards others,

86
00:11:23,947 --> 00:11:26,203
but projected towards themselves.

87
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:41,572
We can say that the first wave started when the Guru,

88
00:11:41,798 --> 00:11:47,070
the Primordial Guru said that if you don’t do this,

89
00:11:47,294 --> 00:11:50,008
then you will be killed.

90
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:54,746
The second stage was where the disciples accepted this

91
00:11:55,038 --> 00:11:58,435
within themselves, and started telling themselves

92
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:02,010
that if we do not do it we’ll kill ourselves.

93
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:24,729
Austerity started on the basis of wisdom,

94
00:12:24,968 --> 00:12:26,968
and not on obstinacy.

95
00:12:33,665 --> 00:12:37,490
But then it became even fanaticism,

96
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,712
so it went to one extreme.

97
00:12:49,093 --> 00:12:53,629
It started with the idea of maintenance.

98
00:12:53,862 --> 00:12:56,441
It started with the idea of maintenance.

99
00:13:02,347 --> 00:13:07,480
But maintenance itself became impossible,

100
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,026
or perhaps they thought that they are not being

101
00:13:10,226 --> 00:13:12,654
able to maintain, they got confused,

102
00:13:12,854 --> 00:13:15,817
and to them rules and regulations became more important

103
00:13:16,017 --> 00:13:18,008
than maintenance itself.

104
00:13:30,052 --> 00:13:33,467
Thus you find they destroyed themselves.

105
00:13:37,468 --> 00:13:43,052
The wisdom or the essence of Guru Tattwa is a balance.

106
00:13:50,369 --> 00:13:52,963
Like when you maintain a plant,

107
00:13:53,163 --> 00:13:56,024
if you do not give it water, it will die.

108
00:13:56,286 --> 00:13:58,718
If you give it too much water, it will die.

109
00:14:03,457 --> 00:14:07,291
So the wisdom lies in understanding

110
00:14:08,128 --> 00:14:12,447
how much water should be given to the plant,

111
00:14:12,647 --> 00:14:15,767
so that it comes up at its best.

112
00:14:23,874 --> 00:14:26,953
Now this wisdom has to be achieved

113
00:14:27,153 --> 00:14:30,195
through your vibratory awareness.

114
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:41,889
You are placed under the most fortunate circumstances,

115
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,546
that you are realized souls

116
00:14:44,746 --> 00:14:49,079
before your Guru Tattwa is fully established.

117
00:15:00,896 --> 00:15:05,399
You have all the powers that any guru can aspire,

118
00:15:05,635 --> 00:15:09,820
without having the establishment of Guru Tattwa.

119
00:15:17,556 --> 00:15:21,697
Specially you are under the complete

120
00:15:21,903 --> 00:15:26,986
blanket of the clouds of your Mother’s love.

121
00:15:35,952 --> 00:15:40,833
But in no way Mother’s love is going to allow you

122
00:15:41,033 --> 00:15:43,443
to destroy your Guru Principle.

123
00:15:49,975 --> 00:15:55,975
As I told you that Guru Principle is a very sensitive thing,

124
00:15:56,259 --> 00:16:01,470
and is destroyed if you yourself do not try to maintain it.

125
00:16:12,517 --> 00:16:16,469
First of all, the destruction starts

126
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:17,865
from the very source

127
00:16:23,109 --> 00:16:25,844
of our being.

128
00:16:41,946 --> 00:16:48,322
I mean to say that our being is created by five elements,

129
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:55,374
and the five elements have a capacity

130
00:16:55,575 --> 00:16:57,645
all the time to get destroyed.

131
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,930
Any one of these elements if they are not looked after,

132
00:17:06,499 --> 00:17:08,143
they get destroyed.

133
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,823
That is the built-in capacity of the elements

134
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:18,786
or of the matter, as you can say.

135
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:26,196
So to maintain them is important.

136
00:17:29,426 --> 00:17:33,219
Some people have an idea that once you become a guru

137
00:17:33,449 --> 00:17:36,491
you need not maintain everything, it is maintained by itself.

138
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,674
It is not.

139
00:17:48,874 --> 00:17:58,291
Agreed that the spirit definitely enhances the beauty

140
00:17:58,752 --> 00:18:01,633
and the health of these elements;

141
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:14,701
but at the human level there is always a greater force

142
00:18:14,901 --> 00:18:16,772
that is trying to destroy it.

143
00:18:24,086 --> 00:18:27,768
So till we have completely become the spirit,

144
00:18:27,968 --> 00:18:32,917
there is always a chance of this destruction working it out.

145
00:18:44,459 --> 00:18:47,335
One may say, why this balance needed?

146
00:18:47,563 --> 00:18:51,721
And this is an important question which we

147
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:56,455
should be able to answer all the people who ask us.

148
00:19:02,499 --> 00:19:06,749
Without the balance you cannot ascend.

149
00:19:11,374 --> 00:19:13,722
If you cannot ascend,

150
00:19:13,961 --> 00:19:17,923
what’s the use of our becoming human beings?

151
00:19:23,124 --> 00:19:26,849
For example, everything is God,

152
00:19:28,886 --> 00:19:32,161
but nobody is aware.

153
00:19:32,488 --> 00:19:35,612
At the human level you become aware:

154
00:19:37,665 --> 00:19:42,415
means everything exists, everything is there,

155
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,298
but it is not aware.

156
00:19:52,597 --> 00:19:56,716
Say, there is a stone, that is also God,

157
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:00,324
but it is not yet aware.

158
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:09,913
Like say, this area is completely dark and we are blind.

159
00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:17,628
There is nothing to be seen,

160
00:20:17,889 --> 00:20:21,699
to be felt or experienced when you are in that condition.

161
00:20:26,582 --> 00:20:31,832
Actually one thinks that darkness is the truth,

162
00:20:35,082 --> 00:20:37,322
that ignorance is the truth.

163
00:20:39,124 --> 00:20:43,916
But when the sun comes up and the light comes in

164
00:20:44,249 --> 00:20:47,415
and your eyes open, you start seeing everything.

165
00:20:53,642 --> 00:20:56,154
You start becoming aware.

166
00:20:58,072 --> 00:21:03,363
So at human level you are aware at the highest point.

167
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:10,672
Now this awareness has to become

168
00:21:10,923 --> 00:21:13,865
the awareness of the spirit.

169
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:23,519
That has happened to you

170
00:21:25,665 --> 00:21:27,411
– you have felt the spirit.

171
00:21:29,026 --> 00:21:31,861
But the balance is not there as yet.

172
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:39,882
Your Mother has pulled you out and made you that,

173
00:21:40,082 --> 00:21:42,947
but still there is imbalance inside.

174
00:21:53,582 --> 00:21:56,685
If you go slightly to the left you can be destroyed;

175
00:21:56,885 --> 00:21:59,718
you go to the right, you’ll be destroyed.

176
00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:07,233
So you have to try both the things

177
00:22:07,457 --> 00:22:12,230
as I have told you the methods, which I’ll explain.

178
00:22:15,954 --> 00:22:19,917
First of all you have to be austere with yourself.

179
00:22:22,866 --> 00:22:26,200
Just separate yourself from yourself.

180
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:32,035
Separate yourself as a spirit,

181
00:22:32,235 --> 00:22:35,188
and look at your ego and superego.

182
00:22:42,282 --> 00:22:44,306
Now you start watching,

183
00:22:44,506 --> 00:22:49,009
you start watching the ego and superego.

184
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:52,762
Do not maintain it

185
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:56,582
– they are the destroying forces.

186
00:23:02,343 --> 00:23:08,748
Now when you see the play as a witness

187
00:23:09,153 --> 00:23:11,147
of these destroying forces,

188
00:23:11,347 --> 00:23:16,556
you will know how to also maintain yourself better.

189
00:23:24,585 --> 00:23:31,153
To separate yourself is easier when you take to austerity.

190
00:23:42,117 --> 00:23:45,663
The worst thing that elements have done to you

191
00:23:45,863 --> 00:23:48,499
is that you have formed habits,

192
00:23:52,908 --> 00:23:55,603
all kinds of hangs-up.

193
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:01,022
Some people are fond of bathing,

194
00:24:01,252 --> 00:24:04,871
some people are fond of not bathing.

195
00:24:11,499 --> 00:24:14,684
Some people are fond of getting early in the morning,

196
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:17,499
four o’clock, and singing songs and waking up everyone,

197
00:24:17,717 --> 00:24:22,249
and some are good at sleeping till ten o’clock.

198
00:24:32,185 --> 00:24:35,450
Some like very light-colored dresses,

199
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:38,165
some like very loud-colored dresses.

200
00:24:43,573 --> 00:24:46,004
If you are English, then you want to have

201
00:24:46,204 --> 00:24:50,727
English-style everything, horrible insipid food!

202
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:05,212
If you are French, you want to have wine, little bit.

203
00:25:10,162 --> 00:25:14,877
If you are Italian you want to have carbohydrates, too much.

204
00:25:20,847 --> 00:25:24,245
If you are Spanish, you
want to have too much fats.

205
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:30,706
If you are Indians, you want to have too much of spices.

206
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,651
So to change this habit,

207
00:25:37,851 --> 00:25:41,868
you have to give first of all the extremes that you like.

208
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:58,110
Now if you say that “I like bland food” – bland food

209
00:26:01,499 --> 00:26:05,374
– then you should say “I must eat a lot of chillies.”

210
00:26:09,453 --> 00:26:11,872
If you say “I like pale colors,”

211
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:14,731
then you wear very loud ones.

212
00:26:20,491 --> 00:26:23,915
Go from one extreme to another extreme, to begin with.

213
00:26:28,624 --> 00:26:31,556
But I’ve seen people, when they go from one extreme

214
00:26:31,772 --> 00:26:34,073
they get stuck up on the other side also.

215
00:26:40,888 --> 00:26:44,839
So we have to be in the center, not to the extremes.

216
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:54,499
A man who is an avadhuta, the one who is a great master,

217
00:26:54,924 --> 00:27:00,809
can never be hanged up by any hangs-up.

218
00:27:08,556 --> 00:27:13,632
He cannot be ruled by any ideas that “I like this.”

219
00:27:19,794 --> 00:27:22,495
He sees beauty in the lush greenery,

220
00:27:22,695 --> 00:27:25,332
and he sees beauty in the trees

221
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:29,272
which are devoid of any leaves.

222
00:27:37,703 --> 00:27:42,005
Now the trend of getting to austerity

223
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,741
in a very funny way has started in the West.

224
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:56,177
Like if you comb your hair, then you are no good;

225
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:05,310
if you do not smell in the body, then you are no good;

226
00:28:09,468 --> 00:28:12,657
if you don’t look like a pig, you are no good.

227
00:28:17,184 --> 00:28:21,600
All kinds of funny sort of ideas have crawled into the mind,

228
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:25,787
because they are going to the other extreme.

229
00:28:30,954 --> 00:28:33,563
But we have to learn from the nature.

230
00:28:33,763 --> 00:28:37,492
Nature dresses up itself when it has to greet the spring,

231
00:28:37,692 --> 00:28:39,673
and when it is the winter

232
00:28:39,873 --> 00:28:44,455
it just gets completely undressed, I should say,

233
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,780
because the leaves have to go to the Mother Earth,

234
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:52,479
and that the sun has to reach the Mother Earth.

235
00:29:00,548 --> 00:29:04,631
It is not attached to anything.

236
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:12,749
Surprisingly it is much more elemental than we are;

237
00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:21,654
while we who are spiritual should have no attachment.

238
00:29:26,665 --> 00:29:29,582
But this idea is also a mental idea,

239
00:29:29,797 --> 00:29:32,585
which is the worst attachment.

240
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:44,206
It’s a very funny attachment which makes Me laugh,

241
00:29:44,465 --> 00:29:46,674
that’s the biggest joker I’ve seen,

242
00:29:46,874 --> 00:29:49,807
that people get attached to mental ideas.

243
00:30:02,268 --> 00:30:06,305
It is like believing that whatever you think mentally

244
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:08,400
will just happen to you.

245
00:30:14,827 --> 00:30:17,575
Say, for a mental person he has to go to picnic,

246
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:21,331
he will mentally put in his mind he’s going to take

247
00:30:21,535 --> 00:30:23,927
this that, that and that.

248
00:30:30,249 --> 00:30:33,354
He may even open a file and write it down that

249
00:30:33,554 --> 00:30:37,554
“I am going to take this and this and this with me.”

250
00:30:42,158 --> 00:30:45,280
And when he goes to the picnic he finds he’s high and dry,

251
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,200
because he has not taken anything with him,

252
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,201
it’s all in the file!

253
00:30:59,408 --> 00:31:03,200
Your Mother is good at speaking and She speaks to you,

254
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,696
but it should not be your mental attachment.

255
00:31:19,567 --> 00:31:21,344
Like “Yes, Mother says so,”

256
00:31:21,544 --> 00:31:25,328
and everybody discusses with such great enthusiasm,

257
00:31:25,528 --> 00:31:27,320
this is that; but it’s not become

258
00:31:27,544 --> 00:31:29,459
part and parcel of your being.

259
00:31:39,882 --> 00:31:43,299
But is a very common attachment nowadays,

260
00:31:43,499 --> 00:31:46,082
with all the people knowing about everything

261
00:31:46,282 --> 00:31:48,285
and having nothing.

262
00:31:54,916 --> 00:31:59,499
This mental attachment is to be really attacked.

263
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:14,723
Becoming is seeing, becoming is experiencing;

264
00:32:16,029 --> 00:32:20,445
becoming is seeing, it is experiencing.

265
00:32:25,218 --> 00:32:27,143
Like if I have to come to this place,

266
00:32:27,343 --> 00:32:30,551
I must come and see it.

267
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:37,328
If only I have thoughts about it and mental idea,

268
00:32:37,545 --> 00:32:41,503
mental picture, it is no good, I can – it’s not mine,

269
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:43,669
it’s not the truth.

270
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:53,946
So when you become aware, actually what happens that it,

271
00:32:54,146 --> 00:32:58,396
you see it yourselves – so let us see.

272
00:33:07,108 --> 00:33:10,025
Get out of that mental conception

273
00:33:10,308 --> 00:33:13,289
that you know already about it.

274
00:33:22,457 --> 00:33:25,049
You do not know,

275
00:33:25,249 --> 00:33:27,826
because what you know is just mental.

276
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:33,376
That should be a part and parcel of your being.

277
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:42,009
Now how to do it?

278
00:33:43,665 --> 00:33:45,707
Some will say that

279
00:33:45,908 --> 00:33:49,935
“We’ll just go on being austere about it.”

280
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:56,863
Then that will become again another obsession.

281
00:33:59,253 --> 00:34:00,377
Some will say, “All right,

282
00:34:00,579 --> 00:34:04,787
Mother has said we should enjoy, so we’ll just enjoy.”

283
00:34:13,984 --> 00:34:16,042
How to strike the balance

284
00:34:17,392 --> 00:34:19,321
is the big problem,

285
00:34:21,075 --> 00:34:22,491
but should not be with people

286
00:34:22,723 --> 00:34:25,158
who have vibratory awareness.

287
00:34:29,291 --> 00:34:33,741
In that also you can be obsessed.

288
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:39,075
I have seen people talking as if they are all

289
00:34:39,275 --> 00:34:41,507
great Sahaja yogis and there were no vibrations,

290
00:34:41,707 --> 00:34:43,809
and saying they are getting vibrations.

291
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:56,389
It is so deceptive.

292
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:02,306
So one has to think that we have to grow further

293
00:35:02,555 --> 00:35:06,851
and see more and more, and know about it.

294
00:35:13,624 --> 00:35:17,783
But if you then ask the French “How are you?”

295
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:22,399
then under the influence of this, they’ll say like this:

296
00:35:22,613 --> 00:35:25,751
that means they’re always in imbalance.

297
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:38,733
You ask an Englishman, he’ll say, “Don’t know.”

298
00:35:43,578 --> 00:35:47,525
Or they say “I know” – there’s nothing in between.

299
00:35:50,165 --> 00:35:52,265
Now we have to understand that

300
00:35:52,465 --> 00:35:55,840
we are carrying the light in our hand,

301
00:35:59,052 --> 00:36:01,598
and the light should not shake.

302
00:36:03,457 --> 00:36:05,679
We have to hold the light tight,

303
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,436
and we should have a concentrated attention

304
00:36:10,707 --> 00:36:12,663
towards the maintenance of the light.

305
00:36:19,074 --> 00:36:23,022
And then to tell yourself that we have to see,

306
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:26,382
not to just understand mentally.

307
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:35,402
It’s to be actually aware;

308
00:36:37,434 --> 00:36:39,649
because you are complete otherwise,

309
00:36:43,026 --> 00:36:45,435
you are the part and parcel of the whole

310
00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:49,210
– you are.

311
00:36:50,343 --> 00:36:54,772
But only thing, that you have not yet seen that.

312
00:36:58,374 --> 00:37:00,420
You have mentally accepted,

313
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,911
but you have not become that.

314
00:37:06,499 --> 00:37:09,277
Because mental projection comes from thought;

315
00:37:11,805 --> 00:37:14,396
that means you are at the level of the thought.

316
00:37:16,373 --> 00:37:19,096
You have to become thoughtless.

317
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:24,477
But if you live on the basis of thought

318
00:37:24,677 --> 00:37:28,096
then you are still below the Agnya Chakra.

319
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:34,923
So all the thought waves must be stopped to begin with,

320
00:37:35,123 --> 00:37:38,175
and should say that “All right, let us see now.”

321
00:37:46,276 --> 00:37:49,162
So from the Nabhi Chakra you come up

322
00:37:49,362 --> 00:37:51,507
to the Agnya Chakra.

323
00:37:55,646 --> 00:38:00,328
Then above that comes the third problem of destruction,

324
00:38:00,585 --> 00:38:03,038
is emotional.

325
00:38:16,457 --> 00:38:21,832
The emotional is a very subtle one.

326
00:38:25,738 --> 00:38:27,905
Like some people, Sahaja yogis,

327
00:38:28,128 --> 00:38:30,129
will sit down with a guitar

328
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:36,541
and will start singing as if they are all lovebirds, you see!

329
00:38:49,737 --> 00:38:53,077
What is it? What is it?

330
00:38:53,315 --> 00:38:57,591
Come along. Come, come...

331
00:38:57,791 --> 00:39:00,666
What has happened?

332
00:39:01,741 --> 00:39:03,620
Why, why do you cry?

333
00:39:03,855 --> 00:39:06,938
Come to Me, come to Me. All right.

334
00:39:07,627 --> 00:39:14,586
Just take her away. She’s caught up.

335
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:22,261
So the most delicate one is the emotional.

336
00:39:26,938 --> 00:39:33,896
This emotional one is a collectivity in a camouflage.

337
00:39:39,859 --> 00:39:42,197
For example, when the Sahaja yogis will meet,

338
00:39:42,397 --> 00:39:45,502
they’ll hug themselves, kiss each other,

339
00:39:45,702 --> 00:39:49,910
and will be very, very nice to each other, you see,

340
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:53,484
and sit down and sing songs like hippies.

341
00:40:06,344 --> 00:40:12,974
Take the guitar in the hand and swing on the tune of love.

342
00:40:18,912 --> 00:40:23,042
This is actually Vishuddhi at the collectivity point,

343
00:40:26,166 --> 00:40:30,491
and that of course is very difficult to get rid of,

344
00:40:34,135 --> 00:40:38,581
because it gives you a very comfortable feeling.

345
00:40:42,113 --> 00:40:49,177
And people get confused with emotions,

346
00:40:49,551 --> 00:40:51,717
they think it is joy.

347
00:40:57,189 --> 00:41:02,272
Joy only can be achieved through complete detachment,

348
00:41:07,499 --> 00:41:12,834
the detachment which is ego-less and superego-less.

349
00:41:16,763 --> 00:41:22,471
But now, the problem that human beings start facing

350
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:29,621
is the assumption that they are gurus.

351
00:41:40,859 --> 00:41:43,704
They start speaking about Sahaja Yoga,

352
00:41:43,904 --> 00:41:45,549
talking about Sahaja Yoga,

353
00:41:45,749 --> 00:41:48,544
and they start thinking that

354
00:41:48,794 --> 00:41:52,031
they have become already Shri Krishna.

355
00:42:00,791 --> 00:42:06,916
They have even a greater ego than

356
00:42:07,438 --> 00:42:11,230
the person who is

357
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:18,995
actually ignorant about Sahaja Yoga.

358
00:42:29,521 --> 00:42:32,271
They start talking with such tremendous ego

359
00:42:32,488 --> 00:42:35,159
that I am Myself frightened of them:

360
00:42:35,438 --> 00:42:37,364
how much they know about Sahaja Yoga,

361
00:42:37,582 --> 00:42:40,540
I sometimes think?

362
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:57,239
And they start asserting it so much that it’s frightening.

363
00:43:03,521 --> 00:43:07,244
All this can be also said, that

364
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:10,048
they feel that protocol is not all right

365
00:43:10,248 --> 00:43:11,826
and there should be proper protocol,

366
00:43:12,026 --> 00:43:13,507
so we are looking after protocol,

367
00:43:13,707 --> 00:43:15,401
we are the guards of the protocol,

368
00:43:15,601 --> 00:43:17,568
and all these things there.

369
00:43:24,483 --> 00:43:27,324
Now those who are on the emotional side

370
00:43:27,589 --> 00:43:30,977
see the ego of others, while those who are on the ego side

371
00:43:31,177 --> 00:43:33,712
see the emotions of others.

372
00:43:42,083 --> 00:43:44,665
So one criticizes another,

373
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:52,192
but they don’t see themselves that they are falling a trap

374
00:43:52,392 --> 00:43:54,420
into one of the extremes.

375
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:04,249
So unless and until you are detached, you cannot see it.

376
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,620
I will not say I did, committed a mistake,

377
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:17,484
but it happened to be a mistake.

378
00:44:21,677 --> 00:44:23,817
For the first three years of Sahaja Yoga

379
00:44:24,017 --> 00:44:26,284
never talked of a bhoot.

380
00:44:30,426 --> 00:44:33,500
I thought I’ll be able to manage without that.

381
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:41,237
But a lady came in Sahaja Yoga who was possessed

382
00:44:41,437 --> 00:44:44,628
and who tried all kinds of tantric tricks,
so I had to tell them.

383
00:44:52,627 --> 00:44:56,711
Now every Sahaja yogi is a bundle of bhoots!

384
00:45:01,983 --> 00:45:03,579
You ask any Sahaja yogi,

385
00:45:03,842 --> 00:45:06,981
“Why did you do it?” – “Must be a bhoot.”

386
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:19,060
If you say that “How is it that you have done such a thing?”

387
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,898
then they will say that

388
00:45:21,098 --> 00:45:24,690
“I do not know, it’s the bhoot who has done.”

389
00:45:30,511 --> 00:45:34,758
They are never there – all the bhoots are there.

390
00:45:39,859 --> 00:45:43,192
Now I don’t understand how to deal even as a Guru,

391
00:45:43,392 --> 00:45:46,559
because if My disciples are there I can tell them,

392
00:45:46,837 --> 00:45:50,037
but if they are bhoots, what am I to tell them?

393
00:45:56,973 --> 00:45:59,280
I can talk to Sahaja yogis but not to bhoots,

394
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,313
they won’t listen to Me.

395
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,875
So this is the greatest escape

396
00:46:08,075 --> 00:46:09,941
that Sahaja yogis have found now,

397
00:46:10,144 --> 00:46:12,673
which is the worst, which was never before.

398
00:46:19,415 --> 00:46:21,324
So sometimes I feel it was a mistake

399
00:46:21,524 --> 00:46:24,283
I introduced this word “bhoot.”

400
00:46:31,897 --> 00:46:34,458
They excuse themselves by just saying,

401
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:37,021
“Mother, it is some negativity.”

402
00:46:44,533 --> 00:46:48,282
Unless and until there is something in you

403
00:46:48,483 --> 00:46:52,979
that contains the negativity, how can there be negativity?

404
00:46:59,208 --> 00:47:01,962
If you are detached, if like stone,

405
00:47:02,162 --> 00:47:06,398
then you cannot contain this negative water in itself, in it.

406
00:47:13,786 --> 00:47:15,655
You don’t become more negativity,

407
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:18,274
you become more a guru.

408
00:47:24,612 --> 00:47:28,112
Now, when I say that you should not be negative

409
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,178
– supposing under such circumstances

410
00:47:30,415 --> 00:47:32,499
you should not be a bhoot, you should be yourself

411
00:47:32,715 --> 00:47:35,082
– then they start feeling guilty.

412
00:47:43,491 --> 00:47:47,979
So all kinds of anti-guru tricks are working out.

413
00:47:52,189 --> 00:47:55,605
I am your Guru, and it is anti your Guru

414
00:47:55,851 --> 00:47:58,495
to play these tricks upon yourself.

415
00:48:03,316 --> 00:48:07,384
Now you will play these tricks with Me, what’s the use?

416
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:14,488
You have to gain something,

417
00:48:14,688 --> 00:48:16,975
and you are playing trick against yourself

418
00:48:17,176 --> 00:48:19,412
if you are playing them against Me.

419
00:48:30,059 --> 00:48:32,548
You have to be more aware.

420
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:37,911
You are not to be destroyed.

421
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:41,817
Apart from that you have to save others.

422
00:48:45,683 --> 00:48:49,443
How will you do it, in case if you do not accept

423
00:48:49,643 --> 00:48:53,387
that it is your privilege,

424
00:48:53,673 --> 00:48:56,063
that it is your fortune,

425
00:48:56,275 --> 00:48:58,400
that you have been chosen

426
00:48:58,677 --> 00:49:02,951
to be the medium of God’s work?

427
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:19,553
Sometimes I feel all the bhoots have come to Me

428
00:49:19,753 --> 00:49:21,587
for realization, and I am now going to become

429
00:49:21,885 --> 00:49:23,380
a bhoot Myself!

430
00:49:36,995 --> 00:49:41,482
“Bhoot” also means “Bhootnath”– is the name of

431
00:49:42,202 --> 00:49:44,639
Shri Shankara, Shri Shiva,

432
00:49:48,457 --> 00:49:52,842
because He gets after the bhoots all the time.

433
00:49:57,210 --> 00:49:59,683
But you have to be the present and not the bhoot

434
00:49:59,883 --> 00:50:01,357
– “bhoot” means the past.

435
00:50:05,208 --> 00:50:09,874
Then what is there to be known? You become.
Then you are in the present,

436
00:50:12,756 --> 00:50:14,505
you just start becoming,

437
00:50:15,505 --> 00:50:16,726
evolving,

438
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:19,459
blossoming.

439
00:50:21,397 --> 00:50:24,171
Try to be in the present.

440
00:50:25,924 --> 00:50:30,156
Do not escape the present, face it.

441
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,339
Don’t feel guilty nor blame the bhoot;

442
00:50:34,682 --> 00:50:37,633
both things are going to take you away from the present.

443
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:50,249
Now just see the whole nature, the whole divine Power,

444
00:50:50,694 --> 00:50:56,409
your ardent desire of ages

445
00:50:57,396 --> 00:51:00,396
– everything is on your side.

446
00:51:11,293 --> 00:51:13,003
The time has come.

447
00:51:14,723 --> 00:51:16,451
You are just there.

448
00:51:19,208 --> 00:51:21,357
What have we to do?

449
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:26,389
Just stand in the center,

450
00:51:27,965 --> 00:51:30,085
at the axis.

451
00:51:31,684 --> 00:51:34,711
Try to keep yourself at the axis,

452
00:51:36,715 --> 00:51:40,527
and then you just see the periphery moving, you don’t mind.

453
00:51:44,923 --> 00:51:48,757
When you see yourself misbehaving in any way,

454
00:51:49,015 --> 00:51:50,867
punish yourself.

455
00:51:53,759 --> 00:51:57,249
It is better that you punish than the Divine punishes you,

456
00:51:57,449 --> 00:51:59,525
because that’s a severe punishment.

457
00:52:05,514 --> 00:52:07,075
But do not feel guilty because

458
00:52:07,275 --> 00:52:08,488
you have not done anything wrong,

459
00:52:08,688 --> 00:52:10,897
it’s the bhoot which has done!

460
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:27,930
So we come to the point that we should realize

461
00:52:28,174 --> 00:52:31,757
that we are gurus and we cannot be bhoots.

462
00:52:43,109 --> 00:52:47,859
We have to change our outside also, to become good gurus.

463
00:52:58,168 --> 00:53:02,293
For example, we have to learn good manners.

464
00:53:06,286 --> 00:53:09,480
Then these manners become your nature.

465
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:16,795
Sometimes, people who are very fond of food,

466
00:53:16,995 --> 00:53:20,120
I always tell them they should fast.

467
00:53:25,169 --> 00:53:28,068
Whatever you are fond of, try to give up.

468
00:53:35,327 --> 00:53:40,661
Try to overcome your sicknesses of attachments,

469
00:53:45,582 --> 00:53:48,208
your habits.

470
00:53:48,638 --> 00:53:51,972
Once your Guru Tattwa is established,

471
00:53:52,612 --> 00:53:56,279
you’ll be accepted as a guru.

472
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:05,305
There will not be any need for you to say

473
00:54:05,537 --> 00:54:08,000
that you are a guru, people will know that you are.

474
00:54:14,919 --> 00:54:17,335
We don’t have to then write on our foreheads

475
00:54:17,658 --> 00:54:19,372
that we are gurus, people will know that

476
00:54:19,695 --> 00:54:23,820
this is a guru walking; you can see the divinity walking,

477
00:54:24,151 --> 00:54:28,567
you can see the dignity walking, the glory coming up.

478
00:54:41,559 --> 00:54:44,412
You have to change from within,

479
00:54:46,457 --> 00:54:50,707
and the light of that within enlightenment

480
00:54:50,991 --> 00:54:53,634
will be shown outside.

481
00:55:00,756 --> 00:55:05,643
But it should not be a mental idea or an emotional idea,

482
00:55:05,843 --> 00:55:08,861
but should be the happening,

483
00:55:09,063 --> 00:55:12,693
the becoming, the awareness.

484
00:55:22,957 --> 00:55:26,208
You have to experience,

485
00:55:26,457 --> 00:55:30,937
through your own experimentation upon yourself.

486
00:55:37,626 --> 00:55:39,775
Even I do that.

487
00:55:41,329 --> 00:55:43,872
When I cannot reach you from one end

488
00:55:44,177 --> 00:55:47,510
because you are a bhoot, I reach you from the other.

489
00:55:52,843 --> 00:55:55,388
If somebody says he’s a bhoot,

490
00:55:55,692 --> 00:56:00,109
then I see that he suffers a little

491
00:56:00,765 --> 00:56:04,103
and faces it, the bhoot in him.

492
00:56:10,026 --> 00:56:13,678
For example somebody, I tell someone that

493
00:56:13,982 --> 00:56:17,315
“Please do this” and he forgets completely about it,

494
00:56:17,576 --> 00:56:20,627
and he says it is a bhoot that has done.

495
00:56:27,282 --> 00:56:30,048
So then he loses his purse and then I say,

496
00:56:30,248 --> 00:56:33,070
“The bhoot must have taken away the purse!”

497
00:56:38,882 --> 00:56:42,297
But I experiment with Myself.

498
00:56:45,075 --> 00:56:48,761
I first see how I should approach you.

499
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:52,543
If it doesn’t work out I try something else

500
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,469
within Myself,

501
00:56:57,669 --> 00:57:01,227
because it’s a very tricky time we are with.

502
00:57:05,723 --> 00:57:08,846
If we had gone according to the shariat

503
00:57:09,062 --> 00:57:11,354
of the chapter of Levi,

504
00:57:11,705 --> 00:57:15,078
all the bhoots would not have been here.

505
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:24,886
Maybe no Sahaja yogis might have been left also.

506
00:57:29,406 --> 00:57:32,244
And this mental projection is such a common thing

507
00:57:32,453 --> 00:57:35,127
that it’s difficult to detach people,

508
00:57:35,375 --> 00:57:38,380
but only way I can play tricks with you

509
00:57:38,624 --> 00:57:42,731
is by experimenting Myself on you.

510
00:57:50,957 --> 00:57:53,780
In the same way you must play with yourself,

511
00:57:53,984 --> 00:58:02,567
and try to put yourself in an experimental box.

512
00:58:18,447 --> 00:58:22,830
Today is the day of the Guru Puja,

513
00:58:23,089 --> 00:58:26,957
the day when you have to worship your Guru.

514
00:58:32,745 --> 00:58:38,870
You are really fortunate to have a Guru which is a Mother.

515
00:58:44,235 --> 00:58:49,608
And My mother and guru is this Mother Earth,

516
00:58:49,903 --> 00:58:53,979
which teaches Me how to deal with human beings.

517
00:59:03,071 --> 00:59:09,439
And she’s the one who also in every stage of difficulties

518
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:13,415
helps Me to correct

519
00:59:13,615 --> 00:59:21,943
My own methods of nirmala vidya.

520
00:59:31,863 --> 00:59:38,637
She has been such a kind mother and a kind guru to Me.

521
00:59:45,107 --> 00:59:48,572
And she’s such a soothing personality.

522
00:59:51,667 --> 00:59:56,710
This, all this green, though is given to her by sun as they say,

523
00:59:56,935 --> 01:00:00,893
is just to soothe us all.

524
01:00:05,984 --> 01:00:08,977
She wears the green upon herself,

525
01:00:11,148 --> 01:00:14,393
and the green is the Guru Principle.

526
01:00:18,745 --> 01:00:21,317
She’s the detached personality.

527
01:00:23,803 --> 01:00:25,447
She’s the magnetism,

528
01:00:26,779 --> 01:00:29,311
she attracts.

529
01:00:31,381 --> 01:00:37,510
When people are walking on her, she is looking after them.

530
01:00:42,177 --> 01:00:46,158
She creates out of her swayambus,

531
01:00:46,358 --> 01:00:48,671
the self

532
01:00:51,369 --> 01:00:53,995
– what should we say to swayambhu?

533
01:00:54,511 --> 01:00:57,431
– ah, yes, self-manifested stones.

534
01:01:04,499 --> 01:01:07,897
See, her attraction and her concern

535
01:01:08,121 --> 01:01:12,699
is so great that without her we would be hanging in the air.

536
01:01:19,669 --> 01:01:23,305
And she keeps Me to the brass tacks, as they say

537
01:01:23,507 --> 01:01:25,055
– to the reality.

538
01:01:29,889 --> 01:01:33,175
If I wanted I could be just the Spirit,

539
01:01:33,382 --> 01:01:36,357
and not bother about anybody else.

540
01:01:42,337 --> 01:01:44,893
The way she bears our sins,

541
01:01:45,093 --> 01:01:51,299
the way she always looks after us and nourishes us,

542
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:54,735
despite our so many defects:

543
01:01:54,935 --> 01:01:57,808
in the same way a guru should do.

544
01:02:10,889 --> 01:02:13,537
She is extremely forgiving;

545
01:02:16,052 --> 01:02:17,761
but she explodes

546
01:02:21,188 --> 01:02:23,203
as an earthquake,

547
01:02:26,881 --> 01:02:31,089
and sometimes hot calcium

548
01:02:31,457 --> 01:02:33,876
and hot potassium can come out of her.

549
01:02:40,696 --> 01:02:44,422
She produces sulphur for you, for your cure.

550
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:52,440
If England’s soil becomes vibrated,

551
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:56,640
then this soil can be used for medicine.

552
01:03:03,222 --> 01:03:06,727
In India people use clay for medicine,

553
01:03:06,927 --> 01:03:08,926
for every kind of treatment.

554
01:03:15,301 --> 01:03:19,325
The understanding about Guru Tattwa

555
01:03:19,525 --> 01:03:22,098
one can have from the Mother Earth,

556
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:26,881
so let us touch the Mother Earth and bow to her.

557
01:03:43,011 --> 01:03:46,011
May God bless you.

558
01:03:58,324 --> 01:04:01,866
She’s subtle!

559
01:04:19,944 --> 01:04:25,492
In the Kundalini Shastra, Mother Earth is the Kundalini.

560
01:04:36,511 --> 01:04:40,845
Mooladhara is the, is the Mother Earth.

561
01:04:45,347 --> 01:04:50,456
So for us kundalini is the most important thing.

562
01:04:53,065 --> 01:04:59,157
We don’t have to worry about what they have talked about

563
01:04:59,357 --> 01:05:04,640
in the Levi, that you must not steal, you must not tell lies;

564
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:09,715
what we have to worry that keep your kundalini up.

565
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:26,913
So the guru has to be a person who is absolutely practical.

566
01:05:31,145 --> 01:05:34,769
He must have common sense and absolutely practical,

567
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,952
he cannot be impractical person.

568
01:05:40,268 --> 01:05:44,177
A person who’s impractical is not a guru.

569
01:05:47,016 --> 01:05:51,727
But practical in the common way is understood as a man

570
01:05:51,927 --> 01:05:55,173
who is cunning, who know how to deviate from right path

571
01:05:55,373 --> 01:05:59,665
and all that – that’s the most unpractical thing to do.

572
01:06:08,599 --> 01:06:11,921
Something absurd, something out of the blue

573
01:06:12,152 --> 01:06:15,527
is not the way a guru has to move.

574
01:06:21,094 --> 01:06:24,376
There is all common sense which should

575
01:06:24,615 --> 01:06:28,615
guide a guru how to deal with a person,

576
01:06:36,286 --> 01:06:40,127
and common sense is a thing which is not

577
01:06:40,402 --> 01:06:44,331
cunningness by any chance.

578
01:06:49,559 --> 01:06:52,695
The source of common sense is the spirit.

579
01:06:57,065 --> 01:07:03,148
The expression of a guru is very, very

580
01:07:05,495 --> 01:07:09,206
paradoxical – paradoxical.

581
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:17,364
For example, a guru will be extremely practical,

582
01:07:17,564 --> 01:07:20,120
supposing he has to build his own house,

583
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:24,565
or a house or ashram or anything – be extremely practical.

584
01:07:29,305 --> 01:07:32,082
He will be very economical,

585
01:07:32,282 --> 01:07:35,295
he will create something out of the blue;

586
01:07:35,495 --> 01:07:38,356
people will be amazed how he’s done it so practical.

587
01:07:41,624 --> 01:07:44,277
But he’ll be so detached

588
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:48,079
that if this ashram is to be donated to somebody,

589
01:07:48,279 --> 01:07:50,157
in one second he’ll donate.

590
01:07:58,654 --> 01:08:02,654
For acquiring – say, for example, for acquiring a lamp,

591
01:08:02,854 --> 01:08:04,887
the guru will be very practical,

592
01:08:05,087 --> 01:08:10,166
he’ll get the best and the cheapest and the most beautiful.

593
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,922
And he’ll be very intense about it.

594
01:08:23,203 --> 01:08:24,879
But when it will come to giving,

595
01:08:25,079 --> 01:08:27,067
he’ll be more intense about it;

596
01:08:32,192 --> 01:08:35,381
that when he will give, he’ll give with that same intensity.

597
01:08:37,097 --> 01:08:39,751
He’ll find out all practical methods how to donate,

598
01:08:39,951 --> 01:08:42,478
also to give away.

599
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:51,508
So his acquiring is actually giving.

600
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:58,644
He acquires to give,

601
01:09:00,283 --> 01:09:03,282
that’s how he is the most practical.

602
01:09:06,370 --> 01:09:11,120
You know that we cannot take anything with us.

603
01:09:17,957 --> 01:09:21,858
Only the guru can take with him something,

604
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:27,212
nobody else can take.

605
01:09:30,197 --> 01:09:35,569
Only the guru has all the disciples and disciples,

606
01:09:35,769 --> 01:09:40,003
and disciples and disciples for ages,

607
01:09:40,203 --> 01:09:42,528
who sing the praise.

608
01:09:52,026 --> 01:09:56,087
No other relationship is that eternal.

609
01:09:59,506 --> 01:10:03,590
It goes on reflecting for ages and ages and ages.

610
01:10:07,479 --> 01:10:11,521
It’s one wave that falls and then disappears;

611
01:10:11,796 --> 01:10:16,060
in anything that you do every wave has disappears,

612
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:20,552
but not the wave of knowledge from a guru.

613
01:10:26,287 --> 01:10:33,705
It’s even higher than the Divine Principle,

614
01:10:38,007 --> 01:10:41,224
because it explains.

615
01:10:46,923 --> 01:10:49,417
The Divine Principle cannot explain

616
01:10:51,953 --> 01:10:54,329
– it’s the guru who explains it.

617
01:10:57,646 --> 01:11:00,979
Not that it manifests, but it’s explains and it works out,

618
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:05,741
so he’s the master of the Divine Power.

619
01:11:11,831 --> 01:11:17,378
So in a way, Divine Power is like the meaning of the guru.

620
01:11:22,565 --> 01:11:25,321
Like the word has the meaning,

621
01:11:25,521 --> 01:11:29,664
and the word – I’m sorry, the word has the meaning,

622
01:11:29,888 --> 01:11:33,029
and the word serves the meaning.

623
01:11:38,038 --> 01:11:44,702
But in a Guru Principle, the Divine serves the guru.

624
01:11:52,532 --> 01:11:56,116
Everything is at your disposal.

625
01:11:57,267 --> 01:11:59,437
Everything is at your disposal.

626
01:12:02,247 --> 01:12:03,894
When you are a guru,

627
01:12:04,895 --> 01:12:06,447
all your chakras

628
01:12:08,223 --> 01:12:09,801
are at your disposal.

629
01:12:11,208 --> 01:12:13,564
All the universe is at your disposal,

630
01:12:14,791 --> 01:12:16,128
because you are the guru.

631
01:12:17,027 --> 01:12:19,665
It’s like the director of the show

632
01:12:24,353 --> 01:12:26,400
– the stage man,

633
01:12:26,608 --> 01:12:28,536
the gentleman who is in charge of the lights,

634
01:12:28,832 --> 01:12:30,957
the gentleman who is in charge of the loud-speaker,

635
01:12:31,157 --> 01:12:34,009
everybody has to serve the director,

636
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:45,631
because he is training the actors.

637
01:12:48,385 --> 01:12:55,635
But the Guru Principle has to be so much unchallenged.

638
01:12:55,961 --> 01:12:57,769
It should be of such a capacity

639
01:12:57,969 --> 01:13:00,057
that nobody can challenge that,

640
01:13:00,265 --> 01:13:03,841
it should be such a capable personality

641
01:13:04,062 --> 01:13:07,566
that nobody should be able to challenge the guru.

642
01:13:07,771 --> 01:13:10,290
Then only it will work out.

643
01:13:22,764 --> 01:13:24,947
So you have to work it out in such a way

644
01:13:25,147 --> 01:13:28,610
that you are absolutely unchallengeable.

645
01:13:32,121 --> 01:13:36,132
And you are specially fortunate

646
01:13:36,332 --> 01:13:39,999
that you can see yourself and correct yourself,

647
01:13:40,265 --> 01:13:44,014
which nobody could do before – you are your own guru.

648
01:13:52,139 --> 01:13:55,882
This situation never, never happened.

649
01:13:59,531 --> 01:14:01,828
You are your own guru

650
01:14:03,728 --> 01:14:06,771
– and let Me be your Mother.

651
01:14:08,958 --> 01:14:13,125
That would be the best for Me.

652
01:14:17,444 --> 01:14:22,194
So today is the day when one has to determine

653
01:14:24,431 --> 01:14:30,140
how far you are a guru, first point.

654
01:14:31,208 --> 01:14:34,958
You have to take a pledge

655
01:14:35,371 --> 01:14:39,121
that you will establish your Guru Principle,

656
01:14:40,585 --> 01:14:42,918
second point.

657
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:47,161
Thirdly, you have to pledge that

658
01:14:47,835 --> 01:14:53,009
you will establish Guru Principles in others.

659
01:15:15,148 --> 01:15:22,271
Fourthly, you have to know that there is a little snag,

660
01:15:22,976 --> 01:15:26,225
that your Guru is a Mother.

661
01:15:29,866 --> 01:15:32,461
She’s too kind to be a guru,

662
01:15:34,567 --> 01:15:36,970
too mild to be a guru,

663
01:15:38,692 --> 01:15:40,856
and extremely tolerant.

664
01:15:43,179 --> 01:15:46,286
So it is better that you take up this strictness

665
01:15:46,486 --> 01:15:49,847
towards yourself, and look after yourself.

666
01:15:54,446 --> 01:15:57,846
May God bless you.

667
01:16:01,987 --> 01:16:04,882
So you become your own guru.

668
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:22,825
On every Guru day I have a problem,

669
01:16:23,916 --> 01:16:28,290
and one of the problems is – you may translate, Gregoire,

670
01:16:28,570 --> 01:16:31,862
still a little more, if you don’t mind

671
01:16:37,478 --> 01:16:40,645
– on every Guru Puja day I think I should become

672
01:16:40,848 --> 01:16:44,514
a complete Guru, and at least on one day

673
01:16:44,737 --> 01:16:47,612
I should not be a Mother.

674
01:16:55,152 --> 01:17:00,214
But every time I try these tricks it works against Me!

675
01:17:08,556 --> 01:17:11,389
Last year in India I told them that

676
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:13,298
“This time I am going to be just Guru,

677
01:17:13,498 --> 01:17:15,977
and you have to only give Me a shawl

678
01:17:16,222 --> 01:17:20,614
and I will not take any sari, and nothing like a Mother.”

679
01:17:28,427 --> 01:17:30,871
And I was very stern with them, and I said,

680
01:17:31,071 --> 01:17:34,688
“At any cost I am not going to take a sari, whatever you may do.”

681
01:17:39,022 --> 01:17:41,522
And they were very unhappy because they had bought

682
01:17:41,802 --> 01:17:43,738
a sari for Me, and they said,

683
01:17:43,938 --> 01:17:45,854
“We have also stitched a blouse and a petticoat,

684
01:17:46,115 --> 01:17:49,597
and Mother, You must accept. You are our Mother also.”

685
01:18:01,147 --> 01:18:04,147
So I said, “I am going to be very hard like a guru,

686
01:18:04,392 --> 01:18:08,214
and nothing doing, today nothing is going to convince Me.”

687
01:18:17,056 --> 01:18:18,699
Because again you become the Mother,

688
01:18:18,899 --> 01:18:22,941
then the whole thing becomes again that soft business!

689
01:18:28,433 --> 01:18:31,777
[Yogi: Mother, I can’t translate that!]

690
01:18:33,079 --> 01:18:34,396
You’d better tell them!

691
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:49,026
So I went to open the, you see, a tap

692
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:51,996
– because in India we don’t believe in wash-basins,

693
01:18:52,196 --> 01:18:54,212
you see – to wash My hands.

694
01:19:07,449 --> 01:19:09,655
And Indian taps as they are, you see,

695
01:19:09,855 --> 01:19:14,231
it gave in and I got completely drenched.

696
01:19:20,517 --> 01:19:22,133
And I came out and I said,

697
01:19:22,333 --> 01:19:25,942
“Please give Me the sari to wear!”

698
01:19:39,990 --> 01:19:42,580
Today I had decided to be a real guru,

699
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:45,697
and a very hard one.

700
01:19:55,538 --> 01:19:57,238
Then Warren came to say that

701
01:19:57,438 --> 01:19:59,465
“Mother, somebody has bought a sari,

702
01:19:59,665 --> 01:20:01,785
and this is that and that is that.”

703
01:20:02,006 --> 01:20:04,614
He gave lots of arguments.

704
01:20:12,346 --> 01:20:16,508
And Rustom and Warren were trying to, you see,

705
01:20:16,708 --> 01:20:19,739
put Me down in My place.

706
01:20:26,465 --> 01:20:33,465
But then they used the greatest argument to outwit Me.

707
01:20:39,363 --> 01:20:41,822
First they said, “The sari is beautiful,” this, that

708
01:20:42,041 --> 01:20:44,328
– I was all right then.

709
01:20:47,621 --> 01:20:50,091
But then they said, “The vibrations are too good.

710
01:20:50,291 --> 01:20:53,800
Even before opening the sari, the vibrations were there.”

711
01:21:00,745 --> 01:21:04,204
So all My efforts fizzled out!

712
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:13,700
This is the play of the sweetness of Divine,

713
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:23,026
what is called as madhurya.

714
01:21:25,884 --> 01:21:30,342
“Madhurya” means the sweetness, the sweetness.

715
01:21:30,895 --> 01:21:34,916
And this is the one

716
01:21:36,004 --> 01:21:40,533
that’s such a hide-and-seek of joy in life,

717
01:21:46,684 --> 01:21:49,140
and that is what I have accepted.

718
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:53,224
So first we’ll have the Mother’s Puja.
