00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.120
Is there somebody here who can translate?

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.400
A mature person.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.200
You can sit here

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.680
But has he not come?

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.440
He should come for the puja, you know.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.000
Everybody should come in.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.680
When they are all here, then I will start.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.440
Now, come forward. There's room here.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.480
Those who can sit on the ground can sit in front.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.520
Come. Nice!

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.120
You like it? Color is all right?

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.560
Where is a... who else will translate?

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.680
All right, you can come.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.640
You do it in French and she can do it in Italian.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.640
Arnau has ... come?

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.520
You are there. Who else?

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.680
The children can sit in front

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.360
- let the children sit in front.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.200
All the four children could come later on,

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.040
when you start the puja.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.680
Has everybody come?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.680
Ah! Robotic motor-cars!

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.160
Great!

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.160
May God bless you. Exactly, that's what it is!

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.920
All right. First I would like to tell you about

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.480
the meaning of puja.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.960
There are two aspects.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.080
One is the aspect

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.600
that you have got your own

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.560
deities within yourself.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.240
And these deities are to be awakened within you.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.920
Deities are the different aspects of one God.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.680
So on one side you have the Deities,

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.800
means the aspects of God,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.480
which are all the time awakened.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.720
On the other side you have your own Deities,

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.360
which are sometimes awakened, sometimes half-awakened,

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.360
sometimes sleeping and sometimes sick.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:10.240
So you have to use two methods:

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:17.720
one to please the Deities of God,

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.080
and to ask them to bless your Deities,

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:28.040
or to ask them to awaken your Deities.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:03.440
So by doing the puja, means when you offer anything

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.520
that you have got to offer,

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.000
anything that you offer is - say, flowers,

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.240
if you want to offer flower to God,

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.920
you don't have to speak anything,

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.080
you have to just offer, that "this is for You."

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.400
Anybody can understand offering,

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.280
for that you don't have to have even a tongue.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.960
Even if a blind man is there, if he wants to give you something,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.000
he can just give you like this.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.480
And that expression is sufficient

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.160
for anybody to be convinced that he can offer it.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.680
You don't have to say anything about it.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.880
So now, when you offer a flower to God,

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.360
even if you don't say a mantra

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:07.600
it is offered - all right, it's given.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:12.680
But whether it is accepted or not is a problem.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:00.120
But now, when you are a realized soul and you offer anything,

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:04.600
it is acceptable to God even if you don't say anything.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:34.560
But what about you getting any reward out of it?

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:52.600
After realization when you offer anything to God, He accepts,

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.960
because it's coming from a realized soul, so He accepts.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:02.280
Now, how do we get

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:08.000
blessed by Him, by giving a flower to God?

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.000
Now if you don't say anything about it,

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.560
you just offer a flower,

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:44.800
then you might be rewarded with many flowers

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.440
automatically in life.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.240
Or you may be, whatever material things you offer,

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.080
you may be blessed materially.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:39.760
Then in a subtler way if you say something,

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.680
as you say for offering somebody

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.560
that humble way of saying that

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.240
"I'll be happy if You would accept this,"

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:54.400
will be even subtler results of that maybe,

00:12:54.840 --> 00:13:00.120
which could be much wider, maybe much deeper.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.720
Now, you do something symbolic

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.600
which is very, the essence, the principle of something.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.360
Like flowers are the -

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:54.000
they represent the principle of the Mother Earth.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.120
Now,

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:21.160
so the symbolicism of all the things

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.240
that we can offer to God has been meditated upon,

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.800
and has been found out.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:59.120
So they use five things called as panchamruta,

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.480
as we have here.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.560
Because if you have hit the principle,

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.840
then you have really hit the whole, isn't it.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.800
Because spiritual well-being is a total well-being.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.600
It's not just partly that your material well-being

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.720
or your physical well-being, or your emotional well-being,

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.360
or your mental well-being.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:51.000
It's a total one, completely balanced into totality.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:28.160
Now when you offer these other things like the,

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.000
we call them akshadas,

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.480
what do you call ?

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:48.680
Turmeric. Turmeric rice, you see, this yellow thing, you see.

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.120
When you offer this, you know, the yellow color

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.960
is that of the Swadisthana Chakra.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.680
And rice is very dear to all the gods.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:29.200
Now there's a trick in it, because it's a human trick.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.560
Gods are fond of rice.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.640
So they put turmeric on it,

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:38.160
means that "We offer to You a rice which is yellow-colored"

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:44.240
- means, "You should give us blessings of our creativity."

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.120
When you eat it, more creativity will flow

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.560
and we'll be blessed by that deity - it's a trick.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:42.000
The whole thing of puja is the trick of human saints, you see,

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:46.320
how to trick God to give more blessings!

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:13.600
But whatever God likes, it has to be auspicious and holy.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.280
So ultimately it works out for the

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:21.520
holiness of saints and their simple hearts.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:58.040
Now, the puja cannot be done by a person who is not a realized soul.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:07.080
A person who preaches also has to be a realized soul,

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.280
the one who does namaz has to be a realized soul,

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:14.480
the one who prays has to be a realized soul.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:03.960
So all the utensils that are used are to be worshipped in a way

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.320
that they are to be holy things,

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.240
they are to be respected things.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.920
You cannot use anything, say the one you are using in the bathroom

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:16.680
and you use the same thing for the puja, is absurd.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.920
Three things are very important,

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.080
is a ghatah, means [UNCLEAR] the vessel,

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.000
vessel that contains the kundalini,

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.520
the vessel that contains the

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:06.480
primordial desire within us to get to God,

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.120
is first to be worshipped, our desire.

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.920
Is the ghatah, is the one made here.

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.920
And on top is called as a Shriphala.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.640
Shriphala means this also has got water in it, if you  see,

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:24.680
the coconut represents the same thing.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:25.240
Now in the subtler form it is

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:31.080
the water of all the rivers of the world.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:46.480
And the coconut is the water of all the oceans.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.000
The water from the ocean or sea

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:19.520
rises through the tree-trunk of the coconut,

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:24.040
and becomes the sweet water in the coconut.

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.920
It's a symbolic thing.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:05.560
So this is the vessel called ghatah-puja, this is the ghatah-puja.

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.840
Now, I don't want to go to details today,

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:10.760
because we have to talk about Ganesha.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:14.360
The same is - now that is water, all right.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:19.880
Then we have to worship Ghanta (bell) and Shankha (shell).

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:24.760
These are two representing the sound.

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:35.880
Shell.

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:02.640
Actually the Shankha represents the ether.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.640
Then we have the Deepa, means what?

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:21.680
It's the light, represents the light element, called as tejas.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:38.400
Normally also to the Goddess they also give Her a fan,

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:42.400
which represents the air element.

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.880
So this is how all the five elements

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:09.600
are pleased beforehand, using them.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:14.560
So the essences of these or the causal essences

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:17.480
of these five elements

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.440
should be pleased at this time,

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.520
should be supporting the puja.

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:47.840
Now there are also all kinds of other things,

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:52.800
like your family deities, you might be

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.160
worshipping in your family some deities.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:58.880
They should not be also at this time upsetting the puja;

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:02.000
or maybe the forefathers who are dead.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.360
All these things are to be quietened,

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:07.640
so that they should be told that this is a puja like this,

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.080
and you do not disturb us at this time.

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.240
Means even thoughts should not come,

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.680
their thoughts or their - any disturbances.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.680
So everything is to be first made into peace.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.680
Now this is the one aspect I have told you in short,

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.600
because it's a very long thing. If I have to speak about it

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:47.000
I'll have to speak at least three times,

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:52.440
and with three hours each time, still it may not be finished.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.280
Now we come to the second aspect,

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.680
which question I asked you "What do you,

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:47.000
how do you get benefited by it?"

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:18.280
So apart from this technique, to have the best

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.440
effect of the blessings

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:28.480
or the best flow of the Grace within us,

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.320
we say mantras.

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.840
The sound of mantras,

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:58.280
the sound, the sound echo

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:02.640
into the being of God.

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:18.040
And they are re-echoed on our chakras,

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.320
and then the chakras start opening more.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:37.200
So the flow of the Grace of God is received.

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:52.760
But only a realized soul should chant a mantra.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:04.480
Because without connection, how will it reach God?

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:15.920
It is a vicious circle.

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:22.800
Now one may say that "Mother, you cannot get realization

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.640
unless and until you get the Grace of God.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.920
And the chakras won't open by a person

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.000
who is not a realized soul.

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:59.720
And without opening the chakras you cannot get realization."

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:12.160
That's how the play of the Mother comes in,

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:19.120
and of all the saints, like you.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:34.920
I would say the Sahaja yogis have to break this vicious circle.

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:49.040
You have to raise the kundalini yourself.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.280
Once you raise the kundalini, the kundalini opens

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.400
the chakras a little bit,

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:13.320
because you have given your vibrations to the chakras.

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:23.600
So once she knows there is a Sahaja yogi standing

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:27.280
behind the seeker, she rises.

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.480
She knows you are her brothers and sisters,

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:58.640
and that you belong to the same family as she does.

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.360
She knows the land where she has to grow, you see,

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:20.840
so she can feel that, and then she rises in her dignity.

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:35.600
That's how she breaks this vicious circle.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:47.920
That's why in the beginning we don't tell them about the mantras,

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:58.640
because in the mantras you have to accept Me as the Deity.

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:20.920
In this advent of Mine it is made compulsory

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:24.280
that you have to recognize Me.

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.040
Because this is very precarious,

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:43.280
the Resurrection Time we can call it,

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:46.680
or the time of your Last Judgment.

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.840
First the realization has to be given

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:04.120
without any recognition.

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:21.880
But not to those who are denying or insulting Me.

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:33.320
Under any circumstances they cannot get realization,

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:35.840
whatever you may try.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:51.800
Even after realization if people start thinking against Me,

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.840
vibrations will stop,

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.480
because of Sahasrara.

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:14.480
And the heart has to be

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:18.240
completely in unison with Me,

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:22.400
otherwise Sahasrara is closed.

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:52.200
Now those people who are simple,

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:56.840
who are full of open heart, you see,

00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:00.040
such people understand Me very well and

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:03.480
they just put Me in their hearts.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.880
After realization,

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:26.200
after going through the understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:31.480
through their mental activity, also the intellectuals understand Me

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:36.680
and recognize Me in a little circuitous way.

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:18.800
After the puja, when they receive the blessings,

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.160
a very blissful state they achieve,

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:28.080
then they realize the value of puja also - afterwards.

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.160
Now in India,

00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:00.320
where the puja system has been traditionally coming

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.800
and has been maintained quite a lot,

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.080
they understand it without any mental processes.

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:28.240
But when they meet somebody, an intellectual,

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.160
who has become a Sahaja yogi, you see

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:34.760
they can't understand them.

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:48.680
They don't want to listen about it,

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:52.440
the whole rigmarole of the whole movement of the brain.

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:09.680
And some of them who try, you see, a little westernized,

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:13.160
they try, you see; they develop an inferiority complex,

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:23.640
and they go to the left side.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.320
But there is no need to understand it with mental,

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:43.040
I mean, to all the time analyzing through your mental process,

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:45.560
and then to understand everything,

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:50.840
and then become Sahaja yogis with the heart open.

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.000
This is rather very circuitous.

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.960
But what to do? They have gone that way,

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:57.920
so they have to come that way.

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:42.760
Because even if they become Sahaja yogis,

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:46.040
they start questioning and thinking about it,

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:48.880
and worrying about it.

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:07.000
So the false people just mesmerize them

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:10.160
and take advantage of that mesmerism.

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:43.280
So one should not feel bad.

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:47.720
If you feel like analyzing, you should go ahead with it,

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:51.760
because I cannot stop your speed,

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:54.640
I'm not going to mesmerize you.

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:27.280
In Sahaja Yoga the freedom is to be respected.

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:40.120
But we do not allow people to come for puja

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:43.240
who have not achieved a certain amount

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:49.120
of understanding mentally of Sahaja Yoga

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:51.480
- from the Western people, not in India,

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:54.280
but here there is a restriction.

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:35.560
Because supposing in India I do not explain to them,

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.040
they don't want to know.

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:40.240
They know that they'll get vibrations.

00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:54.080
They already know about vibrations,

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:57.160
so I don't have to tell them "You will get more vibrations."

00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.880
If they get more vibrations they know I am the Shakti,

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:03.080
that's all, I don't have to explain it.

00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:15.960
Like as you can make out which is the best wine,

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:19.480
they can make out who is the real person.

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:28.600
They know the taste of it.

00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:58.240
Now, once in a puja

00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:01.240
I had about six thousand people that touched My Feet.

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:04.280
So I said, "In a puja now, please don't have

00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:07.280
- the people need not touch My Feet." I said it.

00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:10.120
But they thought it was Dhumal who suggested,

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:13.000
so they all got after his life.

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:16.080
They said, "You only want to take all the blessings

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:18.640
from Mother's Feet, and you didn't want us to take it",

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:21.120
and they got after him.

00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:58.560
Another thing is, you see, in the West

00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:03.280
I never used to make the panchamruta with My Feet but with My Hands,

00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:06.040
because here people would think that

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:08.040
that's a dirty thing feet is,

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:10.480
and we should not have of the feet, you see.

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:12.880
But actually the Feet are very powerful,

00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:15.920
and they can never be dirty.

00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:05.240
Like the River Ganges has vibrations.

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:07.040
If you have the water of Ganges

00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:09.960
you will see that it will never be dirtied.

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:12.880
On the contrary, whatever are inside that

00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:15.320
because it's never sort of very kept clean,

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:18.240
whatever dirt has gone into it,

00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:21.040
it settles down and doesn't dirty the thing at all.

00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:25.080
It's very clean water, all the time vibrating.

00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:59.360
So one must understand whatever is pure,

00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:02.120
which is responsible for purity,

00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:04.720
which is the source of purity,

00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:08.480
can cleanse any impurity. So how it can be impure?

00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:31.400
But with the brain if you think it, it's so limited.

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:34.000
You cannot think of something which is just

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:36.200
the embodiment of purity.

00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:02.440
This is the point we have come now,

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:05.960
where I think I should talk about the Absolute.

00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:14.960
That is Shri Ganesha.

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:18.400
Today is His Puja.

00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:21.960
It's a very great thing

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:27.600
that this Puja we are doing in Geneva in Switzerland.

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:55.800
Geneva is the right Heart, I think.

00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:02.840
The way it is against right Heart.

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:33.440
Everybody's life is a tragedy, like Rama and [UNCLEAR].

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:49.960
And that is why it is very important

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:52.680
that Shri Ganesha should be worshipped here.

00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:09.280
Now Shri Ganesha, as you know,

00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:13.400
is the embodiment of innocence.

00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:32.800
Now Ganesha's color is red or orangish.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.640
Because the child, when it is conceived as a fetus,

00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:39.760
the first color it sees is orange

00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:45.160
of the red wall of the mother's womb, of the blood.

00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:14.040
In Sahaja Yoga, now you must have learnt

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:19.640
that every action has a reaction, which acts.

00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:41.320
The color of the original,

00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:45.480
we can say the primordial

00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:51.080
Ganesha is just of the clay,

00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:57.000
because He is made out of Mother Earth.

00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:19.800
Now when the Gauri, the Mother of Ganesha created Him

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:24.360
to protect Her chastity while She was having Her bath,

00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:27.840
She colored Him red, because everybody could see that

00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:31.760
there's somebody sitting there to protect Her.

00:56:56.480 --> 00:57:00.840
So when you see the red color around you as a fetus,

00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:02.840
then you absorb that color,

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:07.080
and your Ganesha gets colored

00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:10.040
with the red in the same beautiful manner.

00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:14.400
Just it has a reaction of that getting red and it acts,

00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:16.280
means red color of a Ganesha,

00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:21.840
the one who has a red color of a Ganesha, frightens others.

00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:23.840
They know there is Ganesha sitting there,

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:25.880
a pure, changed personality

00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:29.920
with all the fieriness of the Ganesha is there.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.000
Now this Ganesha when He is in a childhood,

00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:33.480
as you see, when the child is born,

00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:37.040
the children are extremely

00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:40.080
protective or fiery, you can say,

00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:45.400
about anybody touching their innocence.

00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:15.880
When they are absolutely young they are not even aware of it.

00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:18.560
But slightly, as soon as they start growing,

00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:21.320
they become very aware and they don't like

00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:24.160
their clothes to be taken out in the presence of others.

00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:30.000
They become very shy of their innocence.

00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:33.240
I mean, not shy, shyness is not -

00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:36.160
in the sense of their nudity, very shy of their nudity,

00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:39.680
so that their innocence should not be attacked.

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:24.560
If their innocence is not attacked and if they are pure,

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:27.240
if they see a nude woman they'll close their eyes.

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:30.400
They would not like to see a nude woman,

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:34.680
or a nude man.

01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:05.080
So this is an innate understanding,

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:08.280
an intuitive understanding that it is important

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:11.880
that they must preserve their innocence.

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:26.640
Now, what is the innocence within us?

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:29.120
What does it do to us?

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:39.360
As it is, already I've told you that it gives us wisdom.

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:56.320
All kinds of stupidity we do with our ego;

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:59.040
as I was describing the president

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:01.520
and so many others at that age

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:05.040
and at that height of their positions,

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:10.200
it is because the Ganesha is missing completely.

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:50.360
We went to Brighton where they have a beach,

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:56.360
sort of a - beach where you can do nude things.

01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:00.240
And My maid, she is innocent, you see, we went there,

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.480
and she couldn't understand, you see.

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:05.360
She asked Me, "But why are they doing it?"

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:37.320
But as you will find that in the West it's hard to find

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:39.920
a really a wise person.

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:57.720
You can say that the people are over-educated

01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:02.200
and they are very well-equipped with other understanding

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:05.280
of the material side of life and all that.

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:08.280
But as far as the wisdom is concerned,

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:10.480
one can get shocked the way they are. I mean,

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:13.640
just don't understand, what's the wisdom behind it?

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:47.400
Because all their wisdom has become nothing but sex.

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:01.040
They always think of sex,

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:07.160
and they always want to understand all the nonsense of the sex.

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:17.840
If you start thinking about your sex,

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:21.800
naturally your innocence will be destroyed right there.

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:44.000
Because you cannot use your intelligence for sex.

01:05:55.640 --> 01:06:00.200
I don't understand the wisdom how you can rationalize sex.

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:10.840
This is such a spontaneous thing.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:23.360
And by thinking about it, are you going to enjoy it?

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:24.800
How can you?

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:38.440
It would be like saying that we can transform a flower

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:41.040
into a fruit by thinking.

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:55.640
And the more serious thing is this way,

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:57.800
that supposing you say "I can"

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.280
- of course you can never think like, I hope so, that

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:04.880
you can transform a flower into a fruit, I hope so.

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:24.480
But some people can think that

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:26.760
"I can shift," say for example,

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:30.960
"this thing from here to here, with my mind I can shift it."

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:42.080
Or materialize things.

01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:59.600
So you know that you can do it, you believe that you can do it,

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:01.480
because some people have done it.

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:04.360
But as Sahaja yogis you know it is done by bhoots,

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:06.560
by dead spirits, they do it for you,

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:10.560
because they are busybodies trying to help you.

01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:44.240
Now, same thing happens as far as sex is concerned.

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:48.840
When you want to have sex through your intellectual pursuits,

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:52.160
you get only the bhoots to do that for you.

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:18.840
Because when you project too much of your mind,

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:22.080
then it goes into areas where you catch them.

01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:45.480
And they are sometimes very sly, sometimes depraved,

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:48.640
sometimes aggressive, all kinds of things you gather,

01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:53.880
and the result is that the sex becomes a nonsense.

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:34.720
So many depraved people

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:37.320
are satisfied once they attack you,

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:41.200
and you have either a very excited sex,

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:45.760
that even if you rape hundred women you are not satisfied,

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:49.120
or you'll have an impotency of the worst type.

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:52.000
So I mean, you are always left dissatisfied.

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:55.240
All such people when they die they also become the same bhoots,

01:10:55.440 --> 01:11:00.240
waiting for some sex fellow to come around, and jump on him.

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:17.320
Innocent persons also may not have any sex activity

01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:19.440
for many years, even after marriage,

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:21.280
because they are so innocent.

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:24.560
It could be so also with very childlike people.

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:57.080
But here it's a science which is taught from childhood

01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:58.880
- just imagine. What is the need?

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:03.400
Do the animals have to learn anything from childhood,

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:06.480
about sex? They produce children too.

01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:43.320
(You have said?)

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:47.800
So the asceticism

01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:52.400
is not what I am teaching.

01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:04.920
First, the innocence is protective and red,

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:14.120
say till the age of, at the most, fifty years.

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:30.240
Then gradually, if the person is properly maturing,

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:34.240
not the stupid people but who are maturing properly,

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:39.640
after fifty it starts becoming orange.

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:43.160
It becomes orange.

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:16.040
Means when you get married this process

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:18.280
of this redness goes away

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:23.120
and it becomes, starts becoming orange.

01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:35.840
That means the protection part is over.

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:05.560
Means, before marriage the virginity has to be preserved.

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:09.280
Till you meet the person with whom you are to be married,

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:14.240
that redness is the protection of that virginity.

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:33.680
Then, when you are married,

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:38.000
the protection part of it is not needed.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.760
But it has to be only towards one person,

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:51.360
that's your husband or wife.

01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:12.400
Then the proper maturity takes place,

01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:15.200
and by the time you are about fifty years of age

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:18.280
it becomes orange - means there's detachment.

01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:21.120
You don't feel like having any more sex life.

01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:23.280
There's no need also.

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:16.360
And then you develop a,

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:19.440
what you call a

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:24.960
proper matured innocence which is,

01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:29.280
can be compared with a

01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:35.320
properly baked earthenware.

01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:09.280
So old age is the really the golden age,

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:14.920
where a person has got that wisdom

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:20.560
shining through the complete behavior of that person.

01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:49.440
But why - again, why to have this maturity,

01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:51.200
why to have this innocence?

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:53.680
Again, because you are rational people,

01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:56.120
so one can ask the question, why?

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:26.160
Innocence is the way you really give fun to others,

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:28.280
create the fun part of it.

01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:31.440
The fun is created only through innocence.

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:51.320
And innocence is the only way you can really

01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:54.400
emit also the fun.

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:12.760
Imagine this world without any fun, what would happen?

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:27.000
But people are very much confused with the fun

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:28.960
and the pleasures.

01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:49.120
The pleasure is nice to begin with,

01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:51.560
and horrible to end with.

01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:08.480
But fun is a treasure.

01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:12.360
Anything that is full of fun you remember all your life,

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:17.720
you can tell others, it's such an embodiment of fun-creation.

01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:36.040
Yogi: There's no word in French for "fun"!

01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:44.040
Can you imagine, this French language is diplomatic

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:50.080
- no word for "fun"!

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:03.200
Like I'll give you a simple example

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:06.800
how these children create fun out of something.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.600
They make everything into a fun, you see.

01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:52.120
And now, you see, even when they speak

01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:57.760
or they say things also they create such a fun out of it.

01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:18.240
The other day My youngest grandchild,

01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:22.480
that's Anupama - she's hardly now six years -

01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:27.280
was playing and she went up to the top of the house somewhere,

01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:30.560
and then we heard a big thud, you see.

01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:00.960
And My daughter, she's a very frantic mother,

01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:04.160
always worried about her children's well-being.

01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:29.040
Fun, eh?

01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:54.440
And she couldn't even walk, you see,

01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:56.720
her legs became heavy with worry,

01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:00.400
and she was walking to find out what's coming down now.

01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:19.280
So she shouted for the child and the child came running down,

01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:20.840
she was quite all right.

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:30.680
So she shouted at her, and she said,

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:33.280
"What happened? Where did you go? Why did you go up?"

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:35.640
She just started shouting at her.

01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:59.440
So this child looked at her, quite puzzled,

01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:03.000
and she waited for her to stop her shouting.

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:24.160
And she said very quietly,

01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:28.360
"I've not come all the way from Riadh here to die!"

01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:52.960
So there are so many things which you write it down,

01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:55.320
it's all fun, and natural fun

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:57.960
that they have out of everything.

01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:00.920
You see, we can have now here all the children who are here,

01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:03.560
there's so many things you can write them down,

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:05.440
how beautiful things they are doing,

01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:09.320
and how there is a twinkle of a mischief in their eyes,

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.920
that they want to create a fun out of everything.

01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:55.000
Fun is joy-giving, it gives you joy.

01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:59.080
It's not just a sort of a coaxing in any way,

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:03.280
or a hurting in any way or anything sadistic in it,

01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:08.120
but it's just a blossoming.

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:24.120
Yogi: Mother, do You think it's possible

01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:26.600
if we don't translate any more,

01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:28.480
because it takes too much time for that

01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:30.400
I think so

01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:32.480
Yogi: English words, we'll tell them at the end,

01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:34.360
also the few who don't understand English,

01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:36.200
we'll explain them at the end, what You have said.

01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:39.480
All right for you? Because I'm coming to an end, Gregoire,

01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:42.640
as I finish at twelve-thirty, so let's do it for today.

01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:45.200
But the next time I think it's a better idea

01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:47.760
to translate it later.

01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:50.880
Just little bit I'll translate more, because we are coming

01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:53.760
to an end, and that's why it's taken so much time, otherwise

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.360
it will be one-third of the time.

01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:58.680
Yes, just translate this part what I've said is,

01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:01.480
that fun is nothing but blossoming.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:16.000
It doesn't tease anyone, it doesn't hurt anyone,

01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:19.840
doesn't trouble anyone but just blossoms,

01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:23.040
the whole thing, into fragrance.

01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:47.640
It is the Divine's trick.

01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:56.720
It has something higher than that also,

01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:59.720
that if you are innocent,

01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:02.840
you really can feel the joy.

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:22.600
So an innocent person can feel the joy

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:25.880
of something which a very serious

01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:29.480
and a very rational person may never see.

01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:44.120
An innocent person may laugh loudly at a thing,

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:47.240
to other people it may not be something funny.

01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:21.640
So the fun-creation is not a dubious thing,

01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:24.280
it's a very straightforward, simple,

01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:28.480
a spontaneous blossoming.

01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:59.880
Now in Geneva, people are really very serious about everything.

01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:13.200
More so in Switzerland.

01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:23.960
So much so that they commit suicide as a result.

01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:36.080
Because you are money-oriented,

01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:45.720
and you are also a sort of a,

01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:51.880
take up a role of helping the whole world.

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:09.400
Means you are very ego-oriented,

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:12.480
because you want to help the whole world. Who are you to help?

01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:37.680
And thirdly, you have a stupid military here

01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:39.960
which is not needed at all.

01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:52.760
Yogini: Mother, excuse me,

01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:56.040
You know that yesterday it was in the newspapers

01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:59.280
that there had been again a military airplane

01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:02.560
which crashed in Switzerland, with two deaths.

01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:05.760
With Your photo next to it.

01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:08.560
It's too much to blame Me!

01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:31.040
Yogini: He says, it was during a show

01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:34.440
where they wanted to show off all the military strength.

01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:39.800
That's the fun

01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:44.920
- that's the fun, you see?

01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:47.000
So everybody is happy about it, you see,

01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:50.520
that this is the one how you see is funny.

01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:03.800
Now to help the fun more, we have got Hanumana.

01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:12.000
He helps the fun part of Shri Ganesh.

01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:35.400
Like a,

01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:40.240
like Ganesha who plays tricks

01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:43.480
of fun on the people who are left-sided,

01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:47.320
He plays His tricks on the right-sided people.

01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:22.080
Like there is a person who was crying too much,

01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:25.880
her husband is dead, "Now what to do? I am finished,"

01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:27.560
this thing, that thing, you see

01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:31.400
- and suddenly she sees her husband walking in the room!

01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:11.240
But this only He does to the people who are innocent.

01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:28.640
But to the cunning, He punishes.

01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:37.760
He'll go on pouring all kinds of miseries,

01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:39.440
one more than the other, and He'll say,

01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:42.120
"Now cry more, and cry more. You want to cry?

01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:45.240
All right, have it more, and have it more."

01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:10.720
And Hanumana on His side -  say for example,

01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:15.280
when Lakshmana was sick and He had to get some medicine

01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:19.520
from one big mountain,

01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:23.240
He brought the whole mountain, you see.

01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:26.080
Because He said, "I had no time to find it, you see,

01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:29.200
so better find it now," and brought the whole mountain.

01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:30.960
He too is the same style,

01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:35.160
can be very destructive

01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:38.240
when it comes to egoistical people,

01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:41.680
like Ravana - whole Lanka he burnt.

01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:22.840
If Ganesha is painted red, He is painted orange.

01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:38.840
And as Ganesha has to settle down permanently in one place,

01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:43.880
He uses Saint Michael to run up and down the left side.

01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:46.480
While Hanumana can run up and down,

01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:49.480
He need not settle down at a place.

01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:34.640
But though He is a settled Deity, Sthita,

01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:36.760
is the one who is to be settled

01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:40.120
- once He's settled, then He emits vibrations

01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:43.440
which go everywhere.

01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:03.840
He is the source of innocence.

01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:11.040
He is the source of the vibrations.

01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:17.640
He is everything, in a way.

01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:26.880
When He ascends here as Mahaganesha within you,

01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:30.760
and in God He descends as Ganesha

01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:34.080
- from here, on the back.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:29.760
So when you think too much about sex,

01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:36.160
your eyes get ruined, because you are using Mahaganesha.

01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:48.240
Your Mahaganesha is spoilt,

01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:53.400
and your eyes starts wobbling.

01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:22.480
The eyes lose innocence, purity,

01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:33.360
and they start absorbing all that is filth.

01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:47.400
The eyes which are pure and innocent

01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:50.600
give innocence to others.

01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:06.600
Not only that, but they are the eyes,

01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:11.640
are the eyes through which the spirit looks out.

01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:33.640
It has many combinations which I have no time to tell you,

01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:35.960
but it's a very bad thing

01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:39.120
that people get those unclean eyes, the bhootish eyes.

01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:41.560
And anybody who is bhootish around

01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:43.880
will turn their eyes to that person,

01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:46.720
because it's a play of the satanic now playing now,

01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:48.640
the negative.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.360
And that is what we do when

01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:39.200
we do not place Ganesha at right places.

01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:54.360
If we have to make Ganesha reflected

01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:57.920
in our Mahaganesha state at this point,

01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:01.600
we should try to keep our eyes very clean,

01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:30.800
so that you keep the seat of Mahaganesha clean.

01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:46.960
In the Puja of Shri Ganesh

01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:50.720
you must bring the soft grass also,

01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:54.160
because durva, He's fond of Durva,

01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:58.360
durva, that's called as durva- because the soft grass

01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:02.200
is soothing to the eyes.

01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:08.000
Not only that, but it gives you the green part

01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:10.600
of the Swadisthana Chakra.

01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:16.440
Which -  he exists when we have not started about thinking,

01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:19.920
you have not started the thinking process.

01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:22.920
That suggests that part of Swadisthana,

01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:25.160
when you are not thinking,

01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:30.040
the green part of it, the lower part of the Swadisthana is green.

01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:18.800
So the green is the one:

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.800
at that stage we have not become human beings,

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:25.280
at that stage it represents the green of Swadisthana,

01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:27.800
where it created the whole universe, everything.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:29.440
Up to that it's green.

01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:31.760
Then when it starts creating the ego

01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:35.400
it becomes the yellow color, where it uses the sun,

01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:37.880
the action part.

01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:46.640
Not "uses" the sun but becomes active,

01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:48.960
representing the sun side.

01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:33.960
So the green represents actually the part of

01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:36.280
Ganesha, part of Ganesha in a way,

01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:40.760
because till then you are not thinking.

01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:42.080
You are at a level

01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:44.560
where you are close to the Mother Earth, you see.

01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:46.640
So the Mother Earth is giving, you see.

01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:50.160
The sun part has not started when the green is there,

01:51:50.360 --> 01:51:52.480
because the Mother Earth gives this green.

01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:55.360
Of course the sun makes it green, that's different point,

01:51:55.560 --> 01:51:57.720
but that you don't start doing it.

01:51:57.920 --> 01:52:01.280
When you start doing something yourself at a human level,

01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:03.440
the whole thing becomes yellow.

01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:05.280
So Swadisthana has two sides,

01:52:05.480 --> 01:52:07.600
the physical and the mental side.

01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:09.480
The physical side is the green side,

01:52:09.680 --> 01:52:13.240
and the mental side is the yellow side.

01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:40.160
So now we are today here to worship Shri Ganesh.

01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:45.240
Now I would like you to get some grass from the [UNCLEAR]

01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:48.800
some soft grass, because that's an important part of it.

01:53:56.720 --> 01:54:00.400
So you should put your eyes onto the greenery

01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:04.920
to improve your Ganesha.

01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:31.880
And when  it is very warm,

01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:35.680
then you can also walk barefeet on the green

01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:39.040
in the morning-time, when the dew is on it.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.560
Those who are very overactive

01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:09.680
should take to the vegetarian diet,

01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:15.480
it will help them to become more towards the balanced side.

01:55:15.800 --> 01:55:19.640
Not as a fanaticism, but more on vegetables,

01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:23.040
and eat animals which are very small ones,

01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:25.040
so it's all right.

01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:12.680
But today I've not talked about His vahana and all that,

01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:14.600
because I have talked in other lectures.

01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:20.120
His vahana - His conveyance - I have not talked about it,

01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:25.160
because I've talked about it in other lectures of Mine about Him.

01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:41.160
This is the best if you can find this,

01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:43.680
like this kind, very thin one

01:56:54.520 --> 01:56:57.520
this kind, this is good one.

01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:05.480
This one, it's all right

01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:11.160
You can get more now, just ...

01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:24.160
With this the water is sprinkled on the Feet.

01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:36.640
Those who have not washed My Feet

01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:38.400
should wash My Feet today.

01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:40.480
Oh, that's good, that's the thing!

01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:46.560
He got it exactly what I mean, exactly the thing.

01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:50.560
This is very good one, yes.

01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:53.680
Oh, but still some of them are hard, doesn't matter.

01:57:54.480 --> 01:57:58.160
It is this kind which has round,

01:57:58.440 --> 01:57:59.640
the round blades.

01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:02.440
You can take it out, some of them?

01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:08.040
These round blades, the round blades.

01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:09.680
This is the round one,

01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:12.680
not the flat but the round.

01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:21.520
Not with the edge, but they're round ones.

01:58:25.080 --> 01:58:27.520
Now let him do it.

01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:31.440
They're round, are they? Round?

01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:34.360
Yes, that's it, that's it. That will do.

01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:39.160
They are not round also. Round ones.

01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:47.560
All right? They're all flat. There's one round.

01:58:48.360 --> 01:58:50.280
No, this is flat too.

01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:53.040
I don't think you have here in this country.

01:58:53.200 --> 01:58:57.440
I think we should get some ...

01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:01.120
This will do.

01:59:01.320 --> 01:59:05.680
You just tie them with a string, that's all.

01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:08.040
That will do, that is sufficient,

01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:12.400
just to tie it with this, some sort of a stick.

01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:16.160
Just tie it up with a little string round it,

01:59:16.400 --> 01:59:20.040
and use it for sprinkling water.

01:59:28.680 --> 01:59:30.560
They are called as durvan gulah,

01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:37.400
means the seedlings, seedlings of that.

01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:42.160
Yogi: Mother, this is used for Easter

01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:43.040
What ?

01:59:43.160 --> 01:59:46.680
Easter [UNCLEAR] challenger put the eggs in this kind of grass

01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:48.240
for the children

01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:49.120
Is it?

01:59:49.240 --> 01:59:51.160
Yogi: Not in England

01:59:51.320 --> 01:59:52.520
What do they do?

01:59:52.680 --> 01:59:55.280
Yogi: The eggs for the children Easter,

01:59:55.520 --> 01:59:57.640
put it in this kind of grass. [UNCLEAR]

01:59:59.240 --> 02:00:02.680
Just see. Oh, that's correct!

02:00:11.080 --> 02:00:13.200
Good.

02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:15.680
Thank you.

02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:22.240
Tie it up, this one also. Good.

02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:26.320
Can you tie this with the string?

02:00:26.480 --> 02:00:31.000
That's nice, that's good. Have you got some more?

02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:36.400
It's better to have bigger ones, all right?

02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:39.040
Because we haven't got much choice.

02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:50.200
Now, those who have to wash Feet.

02:00:55.040 --> 02:00:59.480
Those people who haven't washed My Feet should come forward.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.160
Let her come, let her come.

02:01:18.680 --> 02:01:21.160
I'm so happy you could come!

02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:24.600
So nice to see you! All right.

02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:34.040
Now, come here. One should do the washing,

02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:36.280
and somebody should start doing this.

02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:39.480
You can ask him. Yes, come along.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:47.400
Good, good, good. Now, this will be after the puja, all right?

02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:51.560
So all the four young children, where are they?

02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:04.560
Where's Anand?

02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:12.640
These have to wash Me first. Now, let Me see.

02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:17.440
What about these four things I gave you,

02:02:19.400 --> 02:02:21.600
for the children?

02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:26.400
All right, where have the children gone, four of them?

02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:36.560
No, one ...

02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:40.040
All right, we'll have these four. Come along.

02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:41.600
All right, now come along.

02:02:42.040 --> 02:02:43.560
You - first of all the children should come

02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:46.160
and wash My Feet, come along, first of all.

02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:48.600
All the children, come along, come along!

02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:55.360
Hold on. Wash My Feet. All right. Put some water,

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.520
I think ...

02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:19.680
Where is she? Marie-Amelia, Marie-Amelia?

02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:23.600
And also the yellow one you bring from there,

02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:26.120
one yellow one ...

02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:43.160
Rub it hard, rub it hard.

02:04:51.680 --> 02:04:54.280
May God bless you all.

02:04:55.040 --> 02:04:58.480
Good. Now, Wyson is younger to her, is he?

02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:15.440
Barbara is younger one, all right. So, now.

02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:22.400
Hallo ... this is for you ... all right?

02:05:23.160 --> 02:05:27.080
Barbara, that should be given, dakshina, you see?

02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:12.320
All right, according to the sizes

02:06:12.560 --> 02:06:16.480
I have given them to them each. All right ...

02:06:29.560 --> 02:06:32.280
Done, done!

02:06:32.680 --> 02:06:36.040
Now, just take out the thing.

02:06:36.560 --> 02:06:39.440
This should be given to the people for the head

02:06:39.640 --> 02:06:40.680
- some leaders.

02:06:41.120 --> 02:06:43.360
Ask the children, they'll do it, how to put it on the head.

02:06:43.560 --> 02:06:46.320
Ask Lawrence to do it.

02:06:49.040 --> 02:06:50.520
Something should be under My Feet:

02:06:50.680 --> 02:06:53.400
a towel, somebody should do that.

02:06:56.680 --> 02:07:00.160
I think somebody who knows this should be here.

02:07:02.160 --> 02:07:04.480
Somebody to wipe My Feet.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:08.160
Can you, the one who doesn't have a camera?

02:07:12.400 --> 02:07:14.320
Come along.

02:07:15.680 --> 02:07:19.320
The towels could be there, just to wipe My Feet.

02:07:44.160 --> 02:07:46.640
Here, just to put it here. Tell them not to drop.

02:07:47.120 --> 02:07:49.600
Just to put it there.

02:08:29.640 --> 02:08:34.560
So they cannot be, has to be Chaturthi,

02:08:35.120 --> 02:08:37.600
according to Indians. You see, Chaturthi.

02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:41.080
It has to be also Chaturdashi,   it could be.

02:08:41.320 --> 02:08:43.000
When was this rakhi?

02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:48.360
Yogi: Seventeen days, sixteen days ago.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:52.600
Sixteen days ago, so it is after rakhi...

02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:57.320
Yogi: Two days after new moon, two days after new moon

02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:04.280
But it is, has to be Chatur Dashi,

02:09:04.520 --> 02:09:06.640
fourth day it has to be in Indian time,

02:09:07.080 --> 02:09:09.600
because Chaturthi's the day he's established.

02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:16.160
Because Indian, you see, is different a little bit.

02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:20.480
Must be starting now. Twelve o'clock!

02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:26.680
So you need the translators.

02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:37.400
It's the Chaturthi, has to be. You see how it works out.

02:09:53.240 --> 02:09:56.320
Now, those who have not washed My Feet have to come.

02:09:56.560 --> 02:10:02.240
Now, what you do is to take that ... now first.

02:10:02.640 --> 02:10:05.400
Use this for water ...

02:10:32.400 --> 02:10:36.160
Those who have, who have not washed please come

02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:41.040
... cold water for them to wash My Feet.

02:10:41.560 --> 02:10:44.320
You have to wash My Feet.

02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:49.200
You have to rub. You have to rub My Feet hard, hard.

02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:51.320
Rub it. Rub it.

02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:57.120
You rub My right, and ... the lower part, the lower part.

02:10:58.120 --> 02:11:01.680
Rub it, yes, rub it. Rub it hard.

02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:07.160
Hard, hard, hard. Rub it here.

02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:10.520
Hard, hard, very hard.

02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:14.520
Here ...

02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:33.440
Just keep this water for drinking, not for put ... in,

02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:38.200
but keep it in somewhere, a bottle or something.

02:12:55.680 --> 02:12:58.280
Good, now.

02:13:01.280 --> 02:13:06.480
You're all right. All right? That's right.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.320
Now, you realize that by rubbing My Feet

02:13:09.560 --> 02:13:11.200
you've got your vibrations more,

02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:13.440
so rationally you understand.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.280
May God bless you.

02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:45.320
Are you getting more now?

02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:48.680
May God bless.

02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:52.360
Now others can come.

02:14:08.520 --> 02:14:11.320
Not to hold, but to rub more.

02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:16.160
Not to hold too much, but to rub it.

02:14:24.040 --> 02:14:26.320
Have you been to Hare Rama, have you?

02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:28.080
Yogi: No, he's not been.

02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:30.040
But he does the mantras ...

02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:36.000
Yogi: Yes, he was in Rome, and he was before also,

02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:37.560
he is from Sicily.

02:14:38.040 --> 02:14:42.640
Why his right Vishuddhi is catching? Right Vishuddhi?

02:14:46.480 --> 02:14:51.200
Yogi: Ah, yes, he was smoking before, Mother,

02:14:51.400 --> 02:14:54.160
but he doesn't smoke any more ...

02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:48.040
Better now? ... Good.

02:16:21.240 --> 02:16:28.320
Now he has to read about Ganesha's Atharva Sheersha.

02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:50.640
Your fingers should be rubbed,

02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:54.320
your fingers should be rubbed like this.

02:16:57.240 --> 02:17:00.040
Your fingers are doing it, not Me.

02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:03.120
You are to rub your fingers

02:17:03.480 --> 02:17:07.240
so that they become more sensitive, all right?

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:21.640
Come here, come ...

02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:36.160
Now, listen to what he's saying, all right?

02:17:45.560 --> 02:17:50.560
... Now, he's reading. Now listen to him.

02:19:23.560 --> 02:19:26.480
That means awakening of Christ within us,

02:19:26.640 --> 02:19:30.160
awakening of Shri Ganesha within us.

02:19:50.680 --> 02:19:53.280
Now enjoy yourself!

02:20:01.680 --> 02:20:05.120
There are lots of yellow flowers here.

02:20:09.440 --> 02:20:12.320
What is it - now the flowers?

02:21:01.480 --> 02:21:05.480
You can put these first, I think, that will absorb easily.

02:21:06.040 --> 02:21:09.680
Finished with towels. One on top.

02:21:20.440 --> 02:21:23.440
Now, what is it, Gavin?

02:21:25.280 --> 02:21:28.280
First of all the washing needs to be done,

02:21:28.560 --> 02:21:32.560
better do it then, and pushpam ...

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:45.200
All the washing should be done first, then these.

02:21:45.520 --> 02:21:49.360
So would you like them to wash My Feet or Hands?

02:21:51.680 --> 02:21:54.320
Yogi: They've asked to ask for Your Feet.

02:21:54.640 --> 02:21:56.520
All right. You come here.

02:21:57.120 --> 02:21:59.200
Let somebody who is free sometimes.

02:21:59.440 --> 02:22:02.040
You come along, you can do. Yes, ...

02:22:02.680 --> 02:22:06.160
You come along too. These two can - you two here.

02:22:06.400 --> 02:22:08.480
So what we can do is we can work out,

02:22:08.680 --> 02:22:11.600
because they have to be Swiss - put it down there,

02:22:12.080 --> 02:22:15.080
all right - and she's German, so ...

02:22:15.400 --> 02:22:17.520
You come this side, all right?

02:22:19.600 --> 02:22:21.520
Now, you pour the water.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.160
You will be in charge of water, all right.

02:22:24.360 --> 02:22:28.240
Now they will do the rest. Now tell them whatever is puja ...

02:22:34.280 --> 02:22:36.680
Whatever Gavin says.

02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:49.160
Pour Me some water in the hand.

02:24:49.360 --> 02:24:53.120
See, there's a spoon here somewhere, a spoon.

02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:55.280
So do that.

02:24:55.440 --> 02:25:00.040
You have to pour it there, then pour more water.

02:25:09.440 --> 02:25:12.320
This is [UNCLEAR]

02:25:14.280 --> 02:25:18.480
so that your Mother doesn't feel thirsty, all right?

02:25:19.400 --> 02:25:21.360
Now, what is it? ...

02:25:24.680 --> 02:25:27.480
Same thing is about Amrut.

02:26:33.560 --> 02:26:37.000
Yogi: Now we make the bath of five nectars.

02:26:37.200 --> 02:26:40.440
It's called the Panchamrut, the five nectars.

02:26:41.640 --> 02:26:46.640
First is the ghee.

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:51.600
You need more milk, but little hot milk.

02:26:54.600 --> 02:26:57.600
Hot milk. Something hot.

02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:48.200
Yogi: Second one's the milk.

02:27:48.440 --> 02:27:51.120
Milk should be the last one, it's better.

02:27:51.320 --> 02:27:55.560
See, because they are now heating up. What is the next?

02:29:51.280 --> 02:29:54.120
Now, have they got the milk?

02:30:00.320 --> 02:30:02.680
... with some water.

02:30:08.280 --> 02:30:11.280
Yogi: I already asked for it, Mother.

02:30:16.480 --> 02:30:18.440
Yogi: Sugar next, Mother?

02:30:19.040 --> 02:30:22.680
Last, should be, because it's ....

02:30:24.360 --> 02:30:27.160
They have got it ...

02:30:50.040 --> 02:30:53.040
Yogini: It's too hot, Mother.

02:30:55.200 --> 02:30:59.320
Put some water. You put some water ...

02:31:06.480 --> 02:31:10.320
It's all right, I hope so.

02:31:31.400 --> 02:31:36.560
Quite all right. Take a little cold water, then.

02:31:37.160 --> 02:31:39.480
It's all right.

02:31:47.520 --> 02:31:49.680
It's all right now, it's not so hot.

02:31:50.120 --> 02:31:53.560
And if it becomes hot I'll tell you.

02:31:54.560 --> 02:31:57.000
Put some sugar I think, in between, would be better,

02:31:57.240 --> 02:32:01.080
and that will reduce some of the temperature.

02:32:17.600 --> 02:32:23.680
Now pour some water over the whole thing. Water.

02:33:27.280 --> 02:33:30.280
Pour some more water, a little bit.

02:33:31.120 --> 02:33:34.000
So better clean it out.

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:41.080
And on the toes.

02:33:57.680 --> 02:33:59.680
Thank you.

02:34:00.640 --> 02:34:03.280
Vibrations are very nice.

02:34:11.040 --> 02:34:14.120
Now, bring the towels.

02:34:16.280 --> 02:34:20.400
Give her one, give her one towel.

02:35:16.360 --> 02:35:17.680
Done.

02:35:18.120 --> 02:35:22.320
Such vibrations there, and the hands are shaking!

02:35:22.560 --> 02:35:27.640
Put it down ... because the hands are shaking with vibrations!

02:35:29.040 --> 02:35:31.440
Just put it down.

02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:35.280
Such vibrations are there.

02:35:42.440 --> 02:35:47.120
Tremendous! Are they?

02:36:40.280 --> 02:36:43.480
May God bless you. And this has vibrations also.

02:36:43.680 --> 02:36:47.520
Just put it on your faces, you'll see the vibrations.

02:36:58.320 --> 02:37:00.640
May God bless. You can push them down.

02:37:01.120 --> 02:37:04.200
Let them see. On the faces they can see vibrations.

02:37:04.440 --> 02:37:06.560
May God bless.

02:37:12.480 --> 02:37:14.280
You have to be here with us.

02:37:14.480 --> 02:37:17.160
You have to put flowers, you see.

02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:22.160
Now, married ladies.

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:27.040
All right. Now, you put the ...

02:37:31.680 --> 02:37:35.240
I think first the unmarried should put the kumkum.

02:37:35.400 --> 02:37:37.400
Unmarried ladies.

02:37:44.160 --> 02:37:47.160
In Sahaja Yoga you hardly find them!

02:38:16.360 --> 02:38:18.480
We have seven, I think.

02:38:18.680 --> 02:38:21.360
Three, four, five, six, seven - good.

02:38:21.640 --> 02:38:25.160
Annie, come along, you're unmarried.

02:38:25.320 --> 02:38:28.040
Or are you married?

02:38:30.320 --> 02:38:32.320
It's just you have to try it, that's all.

02:38:32.480 --> 02:38:36.160
You see now, what you have to put is all this ...

02:38:49.560 --> 02:38:53.520
First put the line, it's best is to put the line straight,

02:38:54.040 --> 02:38:55.680
like that. First put the line.

02:38:56.160 --> 02:38:57.480
No, the front line - yes.

02:38:57.680 --> 02:39:01.400
Best is to put the front line, then it's better. And now ...

02:39:04.640 --> 02:39:10.280
Very red today, eh? From where did you get this?

02:39:10.600 --> 02:39:15.080
Very red, isn't it? This kumkum is very red.

02:39:15.440 --> 02:39:20.320
This is a special one. Shri Ganesha is there! ...

02:39:28.560 --> 02:39:30.240
Yogi: Mother, shall we read these names now?

02:39:30.520 --> 02:39:32.680
Yes - no, Ganesha's?

02:39:33.240 --> 02:39:35.680
But I'll have to do the havana later on.

02:39:36.240 --> 02:39:38.560
You can do hundred-and-eight of Devi's names.

02:39:39.040 --> 02:39:41.400
Devi's names you can read, what Gregoire has given you.

02:39:41.680 --> 02:39:43.240
That's a good one.

02:39:43.480 --> 02:39:44.680
Gauri's names, yeah.

02:39:45.160 --> 02:39:47.000
She's Gauri, you see, She's a Virgin.

02:39:47.240 --> 02:39:50.040
Virgin is the Mother of Shri Ganesha.

02:39:50.320 --> 02:39:52.160
So Her names can be read.

02:40:58.080 --> 02:41:00.680
So put your hands with the ...

02:41:01.400 --> 02:41:03.520
With your left hand ...

02:41:05.400 --> 02:41:08.680
Rub it on. Rub it on.

02:43:28.560 --> 02:43:31.520
You can read the names of the Virgin,

02:43:32.120 --> 02:43:34.360
that Gregoire has given you.

02:43:34.680 --> 02:43:38.520
You can read them in French, somebody, and in English.

02:43:39.080 --> 02:43:42.280
Gregoire can do it, Gregoire will do it.

02:43:53.040 --> 02:43:54.680
Yogi: I read the Latin, and then I translate in English?

02:43:55.080 --> 02:43:56.480
Yes.

02:50:08.040 --> 02:50:10.440
Now, the married ladies.

02:50:11.600 --> 02:50:14.360
How many ... are here?

02:50:15.400 --> 02:50:18.200
How many of you came?

02:50:19.680 --> 02:50:23.040
Unmarried ladies, how many were here?

02:50:33.440 --> 02:50:35.320
Seven.

02:50:35.560 --> 02:50:38.480
So can you bring those plants,

02:50:38.680 --> 02:50:44.160
seven plants should be given to those unmarried people.

02:50:45.040 --> 02:50:47.520
Seven plants from outside ...

02:50:48.120 --> 02:50:50.240
Plants,

02:50:50.440 --> 02:50:53.000
plants that we bought ...

02:51:25.520 --> 02:51:28.080
Seven of them, yeah.

02:51:29.200 --> 02:51:33.120
You have? All right, I'll give them. Come along.

02:51:34.360 --> 02:51:37.520
I want you to look after them. Unmarried ...

02:51:57.080 --> 02:51:59.400
May God bless you ...

02:52:45.680 --> 02:52:48.160
Bring one more.

02:52:52.360 --> 02:52:55.680
And now, coming from the Heart!

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:04.440
That's the fun!

02:53:06.320 --> 02:53:08.160
One more. We'll give one more.

02:53:08.400 --> 02:53:11.000
We have got one more.

02:53:20.120 --> 02:53:22.600
One more. Yes, she is there.

02:53:30.280 --> 02:53:36.160
Two more are there? Two more? Two more of these.

02:53:37.360 --> 02:53:40.000
Two, bring two more.

02:53:40.280 --> 02:53:45.040
Two others, two virgins were here in the beginning:

02:53:46.120 --> 02:53:50.120
Barbara and the other girl.

02:53:58.640 --> 02:54:02.600
That's it. Both of you, yes.

02:54:07.280 --> 02:54:11.560
They are in a special day of the virgins and the children ...

02:54:24.040 --> 02:54:26.400
may God bless you.

02:54:28.200 --> 02:54:31.120
Now, where is Barbara gone?

02:54:44.400 --> 02:54:46.360
Genevieve never married?

02:54:46.680 --> 02:54:50.320
Genevieve and Madeleine. They are virgins too.

02:54:50.600 --> 02:54:53.280
They never married.

02:54:54.160 --> 02:54:56.680
Madeleine was married?

02:55:00.560 --> 02:55:03.120
You were married?

02:55:12.680 --> 02:55:15.520
... Another virgin ...

02:55:20.400 --> 02:55:23.680
And you can - how many more now, Gregoire?

02:55:24.160 --> 02:55:26.280
Four? All right. Three more, all right.

02:55:26.520 --> 02:55:30.000
Keep it now, we'll see about it.

02:55:35.040 --> 02:55:38.520
Yogini: Mother, I am out of the ...?

02:55:40.400 --> 02:55:42.240
But still you are a virgin.

02:55:42.400 --> 02:55:44.160
Virgin is a virgin and she must be respected,

02:55:44.400 --> 02:55:47.480
whatever may be the age, all right?

02:55:53.320 --> 02:55:54.440
She wants one.

02:55:54.640 --> 02:55:57.320
Now there are two boys, three boys left, is it?

02:55:58.160 --> 02:56:00.200
Let them give, let them have, the three boys.

02:56:00.440 --> 02:56:03.160
You see, they should not be left out.

02:56:04.560 --> 02:56:07.680
That solves the problem, you see!

02:56:10.680 --> 02:56:13.680
You should never make them unhappy.

02:56:15.640 --> 02:56:19.320
Come along now, you are exactly three, for the three boys!

02:56:21.040 --> 02:56:23.560
Come along the boys, where are they?

02:56:24.080 --> 02:56:25.680
That is their day today!

02:56:26.160 --> 02:56:28.240
All right, so may God bless you.

02:56:28.400 --> 02:56:30.080
Look after this plant, all right?

02:56:30.400 --> 02:56:33.000
Now where are the others? Other two boys.

02:56:35.520 --> 02:56:39.000
Now there's one Matthew that -

02:56:39.240 --> 02:56:41.440
Matthew never came for the puja?

02:56:42.440 --> 02:56:46.120
Here. But he didn't come at the time of washing.

02:56:46.400 --> 02:56:48.680
He should have come, what was he doing?

02:56:49.240 --> 02:56:52.400
Where were you, Matthew, at the time?

02:56:52.680 --> 02:56:54.240
But why didn't you come?

02:56:54.520 --> 02:56:56.680
You are a boy, small little boy, all right?

02:56:57.160 --> 02:56:59.320
Now this we can go to Wyson, Wyson you call it.

02:56:59.520 --> 02:57:02.480
He's all right, because ... can't look after the plant.

02:57:13.560 --> 02:57:16.600
You have to look after it immediately, I think.

02:57:18.400 --> 02:57:23.400
Where is he gone? Just call Wyson, that's all.

02:57:42.320 --> 02:57:44.280
Yogi: He's like a little angel!

02:57:44.520 --> 02:57:47.400
This one has the finest touch ...

02:57:53.200 --> 02:57:55.680
And how seriously he lifts his kundalini.

02:57:56.280 --> 02:57:58.400
You should see the way he lifts it and how he ties it,

02:57:58.640 --> 02:58:01.120
it's wonderful to see, you see, how he does it.

02:58:01.360 --> 02:58:03.480
The greatest thing!

02:58:04.680 --> 02:58:07.440
What about him now, he's going to be terrible now!

02:58:13.680 --> 02:58:15.680
Some flowers?

02:58:17.160 --> 02:58:20.600
One rose? Or some flowers?

02:58:21.320 --> 02:58:24.040
It's all right, it's all right, he forgets it.

02:58:24.320 --> 02:58:26.400
That's the beauty of the young people!

02:58:26.640 --> 02:58:28.680
What's the right thing?

02:58:31.560 --> 02:58:36.520
Camphor? Nothing, nothing serious. Nothing serious.

02:58:36.680 --> 02:58:38.360
Let him have something to eat.

02:58:38.560 --> 02:58:41.640
Now I have eaten something, now you can give to everybody

02:58:42.080 --> 02:58:43.680
now, because for the children specially,

02:58:44.200 --> 02:58:46.200
give it to children, the prasad.

02:58:46.440 --> 02:58:48.440
I have taken the prasad. Now, what else?

02:58:48.600 --> 02:58:51.000
Now for the married ladies.

02:58:51.240 --> 02:58:54.040
Married ladies?

02:58:56.520 --> 02:58:59.400
To the children, to the children, just to the children.

02:59:07.400 --> 02:59:11.560
Where are the other married ladies?

02:59:12.680 --> 02:59:17.040
Genevieve, come along. All of you who are married.

02:59:31.160 --> 02:59:33.480
Now let's have two sets of people.

02:59:34.080 --> 02:59:37.640
All of you can be seated. How many there are?

02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:48.000
All right. We can manage everybody.

02:59:50.040 --> 02:59:53.160
Who else is there? Good.

02:59:53.560 --> 02:59:57.160
All the married ladies come forward. All right. Let's have it.

02:59:57.240 --> 03:00:00.680
First of all use these bangles.

03:00:06.640 --> 03:00:09.640
There's some bangles. All right.

03:00:10.240 --> 03:00:12.400
Bangles. You see, pass it round to all the ladies

03:00:12.640 --> 03:00:15.680
one by one, and then these bangles are there.

03:00:23.480 --> 03:00:26.120
There's another one green also.

03:00:29.200 --> 03:00:33.000
This is to be - not, not it's for you, it's for Me!

03:00:34.560 --> 03:00:37.320
All right, there's another set.

03:00:40.400 --> 03:00:43.680
There's one more; she will have it.

03:00:51.560 --> 03:00:55.480
Now, done. Now, look, you put it in My Hand.

03:01:03.400 --> 03:01:05.680
Now the red.

03:01:10.040 --> 03:01:11.240
Now the green.

03:01:20.160 --> 03:01:22.560
Now the red.

03:01:26.320 --> 03:01:28.560
Now the green.

03:01:32.160 --> 03:01:33.160
Thank you.

03:01:33.400 --> 03:01:35.560
Now the red.

03:01:37.520 --> 03:01:39.400
The green.

03:01:41.560 --> 03:01:43.680
Now the red.

03:01:46.680 --> 03:01:49.040
The green.

03:01:53.400 --> 03:01:55.480
Now the red.

03:01:57.520 --> 03:01:59.440
Now finished?

03:02:03.160 --> 03:02:04.440
Red.

03:02:05.200 --> 03:02:07.080
Red.

03:02:08.080 --> 03:02:09.400
Green.

03:02:10.040 --> 03:02:13.680
And red. Now, ah!

03:02:15.680 --> 03:02:19.400
How they tinkle, you see? They create fun!

03:02:24.600 --> 03:02:29.040
What's this? What's that?

03:02:33.040 --> 03:02:35.560
You open out this bit.

03:02:48.680 --> 03:02:53.640
Now, this is ... You put it on My Feet.

03:03:01.400 --> 03:03:04.080
This is how ...

03:03:13.040 --> 03:03:15.440
That's all. Now finished.

03:03:16.040 --> 03:03:20.200
It's done. Now My Hand is to be done.

03:03:23.520 --> 03:03:25.600
You draw the line first of all like that,

03:03:26.600 --> 03:03:29.360
and the rest you have to fill it up with it.

03:03:29.600 --> 03:03:32.600
See, draw the line, let's do it,

03:03:33.360 --> 03:03:37.120
and then only this ...

03:03:38.040 --> 03:03:40.360
and here, only up to this you draw the line,

03:03:40.560 --> 03:03:43.560
and then fill it. All right?

03:03:57.160 --> 03:04:00.600
With this finger, Agnya finger.

03:04:03.680 --> 03:04:08.200
All the rest, we can fill it up now.
