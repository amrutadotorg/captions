00:01.949 --> 00:11.179
First of all, I have to tell you, the mind
about which we speak and depend upon is a

00:11.179 --> 00:12.179
myth.

00:12.179 --> 00:14.309
There’s nothing like mind.

00:14.309 --> 00:19.970
Brain is reality, not the mind.

00:19.970 --> 00:29.540
Mind is created by us reacting to outside,
either we react to conditionings or ego.

00:29.540 --> 00:39.770
Thus this mind is created like bubbles in
the ocean of reality, but that’s not reality.

00:39.770 --> 00:54.380
This mind, whatever we decide, we know, is
very limited, illusive and sometimes shocking.

00:54.380 --> 01:02.590
The mind always move in a linear direction,
and because there’s no reality in it, it

01:02.590 --> 01:04.809
recoils, and boomerangs.

01:04.809 --> 01:16.110
Thus all the enterprises, all the projections
so far we have done, it seems, come back to

01:16.110 --> 01:18.149
us.

01:18.149 --> 01:28.569
Whatever they discover, comes back to us as
a big destructive power or a very big shock.

01:28.569 --> 01:39.990
So one has to decide what to do, how to be
out of this track of our mind.

01:39.990 --> 01:41.570
Kundalini is the solution.

01:41.570 --> 01:48.249
When She’s awakened, She takes you, with
that awakening, She takes you beyond your

01:48.249 --> 01:50.099
mind.

01:50.099 --> 01:53.539
The first thing is to go beyond your mind.

01:53.539 --> 02:00.720
With mind, you’ll do many things, but it
will not be satisfying, it will be not a solution,

02:00.720 --> 02:02.669
it will not help you.

02:02.669 --> 02:08.330
And when we start depending too much on our
mind we develop all kinds of physical, mental,

02:08.330 --> 02:10.260
emotional problem.

02:10.260 --> 02:18.489
Now the latest is the stress, and this stress
has no solution they say, but in Sahaja Yoga,

02:18.489 --> 02:22.099
we find the solution, by crossing over this
mind.

02:22.099 --> 02:32.879
It’s like a barrier for our advancement.

02:32.879 --> 02:40.640
So when you get your realisation, you must
understand that your Kundalini has taken your

02:40.640 --> 02:44.240
attention beyond the mind.

02:44.240 --> 02:51.549
Now, this reaction to outside has come because
we human beings have a prism-like brain, or

02:51.549 --> 03:00.450
we can say a prism-like skull, and when the
energy passes into it, I’ve explained it

03:00.450 --> 03:07.079
in My books, it goes into bifurcations, or
you can say refractions, by which our attention

03:07.079 --> 03:10.810
goes out, and we react.

03:10.810 --> 03:19.469
If we react too much, then these bubbles create
a very horrible mind which can lead to any

03:19.469 --> 03:21.090
kind of thing.

03:21.090 --> 03:27.620
It justifies itself, it pampers your ego.

03:27.620 --> 03:39.739
The ego and the conditioning that creates
this mind start using this mind for the purpose

03:39.739 --> 03:53.909
of their fulfilment, of their, all the accumulation
of ideas and thoughts which has no backing,

03:53.909 --> 03:57.459
which has no reality with it.

03:57.459 --> 04:05.719
It’s like we make the computer [and] ultimately
we become slaves of the computer, we make

04:05.719 --> 04:10.060
the watches ourselves, and then we become
slaves of the watches.

04:10.060 --> 04:14.319
That’s how it dominates human beings.

04:14.319 --> 04:23.960
And when a person who has a very strong mind
decides to destroy, like Hitler did, with

04:23.960 --> 04:32.100
some idea, he can go on destroying which has
a very far fetched effect on our culture,

04:32.100 --> 04:34.660
on our spirituality.

04:34.660 --> 04:43.850
Now the first step is to become thoughtlessly
aware – where you cross your mind, you go

04:43.850 --> 04:47.490
above your mind, mind cannot affect you.

04:47.490 --> 04:51.230
This is the first stage as we call, is thoughtless
awareness.
