00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:11.179
First of all, I have to tell you, the mind
about which we speak and depend upon is a

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:12.179
myth.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.309
There’s nothing like mind.

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.970
Brain is reality, not the mind.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:29.540
Mind is created by us reacting to outside,
either we react to conditionings or ego.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:39.770
Thus this mind is created like bubbles in
the ocean of reality, but that’s not reality.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:54.380
This mind, whatever we decide, we know, is
very limited, illusive and sometimes shocking.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:02.590
The mind always move in a linear direction,
and because there’s no reality in it, it

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.809
recoils, and boomerangs.

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:16.110
Thus all the enterprises, all the projections
so far we have done, it seems, come back to

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.149
us.

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:28.569
Whatever they discover, comes back to us as
a big destructive power or a very big shock.

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:39.990
So one has to decide what to do, how to be
out of this track of our mind.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.570
Kundalini is the solution.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.249
When She’s awakened, She takes you, with
that awakening, She takes you beyond your

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:50.099
mind.

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:53.539
The first thing is to go beyond your mind.

00:01:53.539 --> 00:02:00.720
With mind, you’ll do many things, but it
will not be satisfying, it will be not a solution,

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.669
it will not help you.

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:08.330
And when we start depending too much on our
mind we develop all kinds of physical, mental,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.260
emotional problem.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:18.489
Now the latest is the stress, and this stress
has no solution they say, but in Sahaja Yoga,

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.099
we find the solution, by crossing over this
mind.

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:32.879
It’s like a barrier for our advancement.

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:40.640
So when you get your realisation, you must
understand that your Kundalini has taken your

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.240
attention beyond the mind.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:51.549
Now, this reaction to outside has come because
we human beings have a prism-like brain, or

00:02:51.549 --> 00:03:00.450
we can say a prism-like skull, and when the
energy passes into it, I’ve explained it

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:07.079
in My books, it goes into bifurcations, or
you can say refractions, by which our attention

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.810
goes out, and we react.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:19.469
If we react too much, then these bubbles create
a very horrible mind which can lead to any

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:21.090
kind of thing.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.620
It justifies itself, it pampers your ego.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:39.739
The ego and the conditioning that creates
this mind start using this mind for the purpose

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:53.909
of their fulfilment, of their, all the accumulation
of ideas and thoughts which has no backing,

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:57.459
which has no reality with it.

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:05.719
It’s like we make the computer [and] ultimately
we become slaves of the computer, we make

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:10.060
the watches ourselves, and then we become
slaves of the watches.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.319
That’s how it dominates human beings.

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:23.960
And when a person who has a very strong mind
decides to destroy, like Hitler did, with

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:32.100
some idea, he can go on destroying which has
a very far fetched effect on our culture,

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.660
on our spirituality.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:43.850
Now the first step is to become thoughtlessly
aware – where you cross your mind, you go

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.490
above your mind, mind cannot affect you.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.230
This is the first stage as we call, is thoughtless
awareness.
