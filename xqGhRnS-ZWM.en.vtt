02:20.051 --> 02:23.496
[Talk in Marathi for the first
14 minutes, then in English]

14:49.127 --> 14:51.025
We have come to this place many a times,

14:51.226 --> 14:52.993
this beautiful place, you all like it.

14:53.194 --> 14:56.775
It’s very rustic, absolutely in
the interior.

14:56.976 --> 15:01.076
Only thing is, coming all the way from
Ganapatipule,

15:01.277 --> 15:04.460
you have to spend lot of time.

15:05.539 --> 15:13.982
All this you are doing just to enjoy
the beauty of nature,

15:14.198 --> 15:16.795
and to be with the nature.

15:16.996 --> 15:25.749
I have told you already that this fruit
of coconut is called as Shriphala,

15:25.950 --> 15:29.788
because it is the Sahasrara,

15:29.988 --> 15:33.161
and it’s very surprising

15:33.361 --> 15:36.297
that this fruit knows and understands.

15:36.498 --> 15:41.580
It won’t fall on any animal or on any
person.

15:41.781 --> 15:44.568
If you are sleeping here, it will never
fall on you.

15:44.768 --> 15:48.221
Nobody is hurt, ever, by this fruit.

15:48.422 --> 15:52.313
It is so sensible, more than human beings,

15:52.513 --> 15:55.539
because we do hurt others, we do trouble
others,

15:55.740 --> 15:58.655
we don’t think what we are doing.

15:59.886 --> 16:05.036
But in Sahaja Yoga there’s lot of
sweetness, goodness, righteousness,

16:05.237 --> 16:08.667
and it’s so encouraging.

16:08.868 --> 16:11.968
Also so many people are there, newly
married.

16:12.169 --> 16:15.026
I congratulate them, all of them.

16:15.227 --> 16:18.082
Now try to be...

16:22.521 --> 16:24.566
Try to be kind to each other.

16:24.767 --> 16:28.267
If you are reserved in the beginning,
you’ll have to pay for it.

16:28.475 --> 16:32.399
Please try to be nice, kind and talkative;

16:32.600 --> 16:38.403
not that you just keep quiet and don’t
talk to someone.

16:38.610 --> 16:43.434
Maybe there’s sort of a way of impressing
others:

16:43.634 --> 16:45.821
not in our Sahaja Yoga.

16:46.022 --> 16:49.643
In Sahaja Yoga I talk too much, that’s why
My throat is off today,

16:49.844 --> 16:52.169
and you also talk.

16:52.370 --> 16:57.776
Talking is very important, not hiding your
feelings.

16:57.977 --> 17:02.135
I have told lots of things about it, how
to make a marriage happy,

17:02.336 --> 17:04.561
that will make [you] very happy also.

17:04.762 --> 17:09.249
If you have very good marriages we’ll have
very good children born to you,

17:09.450 --> 17:14.630
and then we’ll have a new race of people
in this world.

17:14.831 --> 17:18.245
These children will be the most powerful
things for us,

17:18.446 --> 17:20.201
and they’ll work out many things

17:20.401 --> 17:23.323
which we could not work out.

17:31.497 --> 17:37.244
Regarding our tour, I hope you have been
happy about it,

17:37.444 --> 17:41.653
and then you enjoyed all the programs
that we had.

17:53.413 --> 17:56.485
Today I am going to tell you something
about the sea,

17:56.686 --> 17:58.728
because we are next to the sea here,

17:58.929 --> 18:03.120
and must understand the feelings of a sea.

18:03.320 --> 18:05.918
Sea is your grandfather in a way,

18:06.119 --> 18:13.938
because he gave birth to Lakshmi, who
becomes Mahalakshmi later on.

18:14.139 --> 18:21.223
So this sea which is the grandfather, we
have to show all respect to him.

18:21.423 --> 18:30.594
Normally the way people are living, in
the West specially, also in India,

18:30.803 --> 18:35.864
people go and use it for bathrooms.

18:36.065 --> 18:39.529
But also in the West they use it in a very
funny way,

18:39.730 --> 18:45.201
that they use it for swimming and all kinds
of things,

18:45.418 --> 18:48.184
by which they wear funny dresses

18:48.385 --> 18:52.630
and lead a very licentious life.

18:52.831 --> 18:55.541
This is an insult to the sea.

18:55.742 --> 19:00.345
We must respect the sea. In India we
worship the sea.

19:00.564 --> 19:04.545
We have to worship the sea. And in
the Greek mythology also

19:04.746 --> 19:10.296
they had a, as we have Varuna, they too had
a God for sea.

19:10.497 --> 19:14.741
So this God for sea has to be worshipped,

19:14.942 --> 19:18.932
and has to be understood and to be
respected.

19:19.133 --> 19:20.808
We cannot be disrespectful.

19:21.016 --> 19:24.727
Before entering into sea you must say
namaskar to the sea,

19:24.928 --> 19:29.064
and coming out of it also you must say
namaskar.

19:31.396 --> 19:35.283
The way we behave towards the sea is not
proper.

19:35.484 --> 19:39.415
As you know, because of sea we get rain.

19:39.616 --> 19:44.248
If there was no sea we would not have
rain, we would not have anything.

19:44.449 --> 19:47.684
Sea is so important to our life.

19:47.885 --> 19:50.036
The greatest thing is, sea is the Guru,

19:50.237 --> 19:55.017
is the Mahaguru which teaches us so many
things.

19:55.510 --> 20:01.262
First of all, this Mahaguru is the one,
creates salt for us.

20:01.463 --> 20:07.542
Christ has said: “You are the salt, salt
of the universe”;

20:07.750 --> 20:11.958
meaning, you are the one which gives taste

20:12.158 --> 20:15.847
and all the qualities of the salt to
the human beings.

20:16.047 --> 20:19.899
So this sea is there, we have to learn
a lot from this sea.

20:20.099 --> 20:24.404
The first of all is that it has its own
maryadas.

20:24.605 --> 20:28.610
Supposing you try to press the sea from
this side,

20:28.811 --> 20:30.890
it will appear on the other side.

20:31.097 --> 20:33.239
It always keeps to its maryadas.

20:33.439 --> 20:37.592
Such a huge thing are these oceans –
are such huge,

20:37.792 --> 20:39.554
but they keep to their maryadas,

20:39.754 --> 20:43.279
they never cross their maryadas.

20:43.573 --> 20:50.880
While we just start encroaching on
everybody’s maryadas.

20:51.247 --> 20:53.867
So the maryadas of the sea is very
important –

20:54.084 --> 20:58.865
that it just keeps to its own line.

20:59.066 --> 21:02.385
You can draw the line when it is a high
tide,

21:02.586 --> 21:04.701
next day, whenever there will be a high
tide,

21:04.901 --> 21:07.620
it will be just there.

21:08.251 --> 21:11.398
So imagine such a huge thing like an ocean

21:11.599 --> 21:16.086
can keep itself to the same maryadas,

21:16.302 --> 21:19.612
why can’t we, with such a personality
of ours,

21:19.812 --> 21:24.611
should keep to ourselves and to our
maryadas?

21:25.080 --> 21:30.079
Then the second quality of the sea is that
it looks after

21:30.279 --> 21:33.344
all the animals that are in it.

21:33.544 --> 21:37.447
Somehow it is a saltish thing, but there
are fishes

21:37.648 --> 21:42.816
and there are all kinds of animals which
exist in the sea,

21:43.017 --> 21:45.543
and that’s why it is, we should say,

21:45.744 --> 21:49.940
the first life came into being in the sea.

21:50.141 --> 21:53.479
So all our forefathers, long time back,

21:53.680 --> 21:55.470
must have been born in the sea,

21:55.671 --> 21:58.425
and then we, now we have become human
beings.

21:58.626 --> 22:01.459
So we have no right to insult the sea,

22:01.660 --> 22:04.797
where our forefathers must have existed

22:04.998 --> 22:07.776
and then they started coming out, one
by one

22:07.976 --> 22:13.321
as the fish came, as a reptile.

22:15.782 --> 22:23.781
Now the third quality of the sea is that
it is a deep thing,

22:23.981 --> 22:28.818
it is very deep. In some places is
extremely deep.

22:29.019 --> 22:32.652
If the depth of the sea is reduced

22:32.852 --> 22:40.947
even by few, few feet, there will be
problem all over.

22:41.147 --> 22:44.158
It keeps to its depth. It doesn’t leave
its depth.

22:44.359 --> 22:48.612
It keeps to its maryadas, and it keeps
to its depth.

22:48.813 --> 22:51.100
In the same way, whatever depth we have got

22:51.300 --> 22:53.665
in Sahaja Yoga, we should keep to that.

22:53.866 --> 22:58.468
Normally we should not become cheap type
people,

22:58.669 --> 23:02.114
we cannot afford. We have to be deep people

23:02.314 --> 23:04.522
with deep understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

23:04.722 --> 23:06.618
deep understanding of ourselves,

23:06.819 --> 23:08.819
because that’s the sign of dignity.

23:09.019 --> 23:11.222
And that dignity you must have,

23:11.423 --> 23:15.631
that majestic nature of the sea you must
have.

23:15.832 --> 23:19.788
Now these trees as they are you see, are
very surprisingly,

23:19.988 --> 23:24.808
they are getting all the wind from the sea.

23:25.015 --> 23:27.739
But if you go nearer the sea when they are
planted,

23:27.939 --> 23:31.846
they all bend towards the sea, never away.

23:32.046 --> 23:38.106
They give their, sort of, gratitude by
bending towards the sea.

23:38.307 --> 23:40.657
Though the wind is blowing the other way
round,

23:40.858 --> 23:42.439
but they’re not bothered about the wind.

23:42.639 --> 23:46.531
Their gratitude is to the sea, so they bend
towards the sea.

23:46.731 --> 23:51.386
Even these trees understand what it is
like.

23:51.641 --> 23:54.536
Without the sea we could not have had
any transport

23:54.737 --> 23:57.142
from places to places as we have been,

23:57.342 --> 24:03.560
and also there is a great lot of wealth
inside the bed of the sea

24:03.761 --> 24:06.083
which is not yet explored; but once
explored,

24:06.284 --> 24:08.028
the whole world can be very rich.

24:08.229 --> 24:10.358
But they are fighting about it, which part
is ours,

24:10.559 --> 24:14.162
which part is yours; that in that fight do
you know, I think

24:14.363 --> 24:20.516
all this inside the sea might shift from
one place to another!

24:20.716 --> 24:24.610
And lots of wealth which is of…

24:24.810 --> 24:29.985
which is like gold, silver, diamonds, are
all embedded in the sea.

24:30.186 --> 24:34.022
And one day may be that this Lakshmi might
be discovered,

24:34.222 --> 24:38.336
and we people will be enriched all over.

24:39.107 --> 24:41.863
Moreover when we carry the transport,

24:42.063 --> 24:46.285
we carry Lakshmi from one place to another,
from another place to this place,

24:46.486 --> 24:50.961
so the sea has given us that mobility and
movement.

24:51.621 --> 24:57.140
I have seen the sea reacts to Me very much.

24:57.341 --> 25:01.101
It reacts, because if there’s a light

25:01.302 --> 25:06.486
in the sea, or a moon, sun in the - moon
in the sea reflecting,

25:06.686 --> 25:09.553
it moves with Me, I’ve seen it, it moves
with Me.

25:09.754 --> 25:12.419
The sea understands Me very well,

25:12.620 --> 25:17.745
because I have a special relationship and
a respect for that sea.

25:17.946 --> 25:22.738
Now when you are here, I hope you’ll
understand the value of the sea.

25:22.939 --> 25:25.308
Because of the sea you are so much enjoying
here,

25:25.508 --> 25:30.811
it is giving you such good feelings, and
all spirituality.

25:31.845 --> 25:35.332
There is no need to go to Himalayas.

25:36.789 --> 25:39.691
The – whatever is covering is in
the Himalayas,

25:39.891 --> 25:44.184
is what is nothing but the water from
the sea only.

25:44.385 --> 25:49.634
It’s one of the circles, that water passes
to the Himalayas,

25:49.843 --> 25:53.897
then comes back as rivers, again falls into
the same sea.

25:54.098 --> 25:59.682
They have to come to the sea. So it is
everything ends up here.

25:59.883 --> 26:04.801
And then it is allowed – it goes through
tapasya – it allows the Sun

26:05.002 --> 26:13.337
to create that cloud by suffering the heat,

26:13.537 --> 26:16.920
heat of the Sun, and becomes vapours,

26:17.120 --> 26:22.125
and then it goes as clouds and you get your
rain.

26:22.326 --> 26:25.232
In the same way we have to be;

26:25.432 --> 26:29.141
we have to bear the heat of others,

26:29.341 --> 26:33.336
the anger of others and create vapours –

26:33.537 --> 26:36.372
means the blessings, the vibrations for
others.

26:36.572 --> 26:38.801
It is with Me, same thing.

26:39.002 --> 26:42.234
When I see somebody who is sick and I
treat him,

26:42.435 --> 26:46.956
of course I have to bear a little bit,
sometimes quite a lot,

26:47.266 --> 26:50.716
then I absorb it and then they become
vibrations.

26:50.916 --> 26:53.161
They just start flowing as vibrations.

26:53.361 --> 26:55.332
So this is what you have to learn from
the sea,

26:55.533 --> 26:57.988
which is very important for sahaja yogis,

26:58.189 --> 27:00.751
that you absorb everything, doesn’t matter.

27:00.952 --> 27:04.159
But don’t get attached to it, and let it
become vapours,

27:04.360 --> 27:10.515
and the Sea can now become the vapours.

27:10.715 --> 27:13.444
As you all are here, all these vapours

27:13.644 --> 27:16.034
as vibrations should flow.

27:16.234 --> 27:19.945
This method you should try to understand
by courage.

27:20.145 --> 27:22.908
Because the other day when I was coming,
there was a lady sitting

27:23.109 --> 27:25.409
just on the way: “Mother, her feet

27:25.610 --> 27:30.289
are out of order, or something gone wrong.
Please treat her.”

27:30.559 --> 27:32.886
Why should I treat? Why can’t you treat?

27:33.087 --> 27:36.135
Are you afraid to treat someone?

27:36.683 --> 27:39.384
Then there’s another one who comes up
to say: “Mother, You treat her.”

27:39.585 --> 27:40.978
Why can’t you treat?

27:41.179 --> 27:44.767
You all can treat them, you can help them,

27:44.968 --> 27:49.613
and you’ll be surprised, the more you’ll
treat them the better you will be.

27:49.814 --> 27:54.121
You should venture, you should have that
much courage to treat others.

27:54.322 --> 27:58.728
If you don’t treat others you won’t grow

27:58.928 --> 28:02.720
because that is what, like the sea, as you
have seen,

28:02.920 --> 28:09.082
you become the vibrations. And when you
treat others there are more vibrations.

28:09.283 --> 28:11.077
Why should God give you vibrations

28:11.277 --> 28:15.478
if you are not going to use it? Simple
logic.

28:15.748 --> 28:20.541
Why should God give you light if you are
not going to use it?

28:20.741 --> 28:26.772
Christ has said that, “You don’t put light
under a measure.”

28:27.543 --> 28:31.969
That’s what we are doing when we are not
using our hands,

28:32.169 --> 28:35.788
our feet, our brains for Sahaja Yoga:

28:35.989 --> 28:38.738
we are not creating vibrations within
ourselves.

28:38.945 --> 28:42.997
The same body that is yours can just become
a bundle of vibrations,

28:43.198 --> 28:46.619
if you start using these vibrations.

28:47.342 --> 28:50.692
But if you don’t use these vibrations
you’ll have problems

28:50.900 --> 28:53.873
problems all the time, and you will not
understand:

28:54.073 --> 28:56.492
“Why? I am doing everything, I am doing
this” –

28:56.693 --> 28:59.466
because you are not using your vibrations.

28:59.667 --> 29:03.587
You have to use your vibrations in every
way possible,

29:03.788 --> 29:06.900
whenever is possible, to help others

29:07.108 --> 29:10.450
to get all right, to get well.

29:12.554 --> 29:14.417
You can at the most take a bandhan if you
like,

29:14.617 --> 29:17.038
if you think that it might hurt you or
something,

29:17.238 --> 29:19.484
but at least use My photograph.

29:19.685 --> 29:23.271
And after the photograph you can just touch
the person, there’s no harm.

29:23.472 --> 29:29.695
After all, if you are afraid even of any
troubles,

29:29.895 --> 29:33.326
then what’s the use of becoming a sahaja
yogi?

29:34.707 --> 29:38.881
If the ship is not seaworthy, what’s
the use of making a ship?

29:39.081 --> 29:41.970
You have to be seaworthy.

29:43.479 --> 29:47.828
And that’s what you have to decide, that:
“We are going to be Sahaja Yoga worthy,

29:48.028 --> 29:51.401
and for that we are going to absorb all
the vibrations,

29:51.602 --> 29:54.303
we are going to take up everything upon
ourselves.”

29:54.510 --> 29:57.606
Little trouble also they have, they’ll tell
Me ten times:

29:57.815 --> 29:59.786
“We went there, then this happened,

29:59.986 --> 30:02.222
then that happened, then this.”

30:02.423 --> 30:05.427
But I never tell you anything, what happens
to Me,

30:05.627 --> 30:09.255
how I came here, what was there; nothing!

30:09.471 --> 30:12.462
Because I know that all this is, whatever
I am doing,

30:12.663 --> 30:16.701
is created into vibrations. In the same way
have faith,

30:16.902 --> 30:21.157
that you are all just like the sea, like
the Mahaguru,

30:21.357 --> 30:26.083
and that whatever you are doing is creating
vibrations within you,

30:26.283 --> 30:29.999
by which you can save so many.

30:31.064 --> 30:33.796
It’s something like a cycle again, I said,

30:33.997 --> 30:37.111
that the more you give, the more you get.

30:37.312 --> 30:42.083
The more you use your vibrations, much more
you’ll get it.

30:42.284 --> 30:48.843
It’s a very nice cycle that is acting as it
has acted in the case of the sea,

30:49.044 --> 30:52.518
as I told you, that the water goes
to the Himalayas,

30:52.719 --> 30:56.051
comes back at rivers. In the same way

30:56.252 --> 31:01.453
manifold, manifold your vibrations will be
growing,

31:01.653 --> 31:06.194
and I would say that we should always use
our vibrations

31:06.394 --> 31:12.746
for helping others, for giving to many
things, to the plant, to the anything.

31:12.953 --> 31:14.808
I mean there were some people who brought
a plant:

31:15.008 --> 31:19.511
“Mother, give vibrations to that.” I said:
“Why don’t you give the vibrations?”

31:19.712 --> 31:21.640
There’s no need even to take vibrated
water.

31:21.840 --> 31:25.196
You can vibrate yourself. That state has
to come,

31:25.397 --> 31:27.837
that you can vibrate your own water,

31:28.037 --> 31:29.891
you can vibrate the whole waters
everywhere,

31:30.092 --> 31:32.269
there’s no need to take vibrated water
from Me.

31:32.470 --> 31:37.016
Maybe Mine is a little more, but doesn’t
matter!

31:45.143 --> 31:49.393
But you are so many, so what – compared
to Me, I’m only one.

31:49.594 --> 31:52.398
So all of you can work it out and do such
a lot;

31:52.599 --> 31:54.954
but have faith in yourself.

31:55.155 --> 31:56.848
As the sea has faith in itself,

31:57.048 --> 31:59.374
you should have complete faith in yourself.

31:59.589 --> 32:02.561
You must respect your Self Realization.

32:02.761 --> 32:06.587
Tell every day to yourself: “I am a sahaja
yogi.

32:06.788 --> 32:09.225
I am a yogi, I am a saint,

32:09.426 --> 32:13.620
I am a realised soul. I have to do this.

32:13.820 --> 32:17.823
How can I do these other nonsensical
things? I have to do these good things.

32:18.023 --> 32:20.823
I have to talk to people in a sweet manner,

32:21.024 --> 32:25.338
I have to try to work it out this way.”

32:26.101 --> 32:33.719
It is actually your faith in yourself is
going to help.

32:33.920 --> 32:36.907
Your faith in yourself – that you are
a great sahaja yogi,

32:37.107 --> 32:42.580
that you are absolutely surrendered to your
Mother, works very fast.

32:42.788 --> 32:45.565
That faith you should have, that you are
a sahaja yogi.

32:45.766 --> 32:48.204
Nothing else is needed.

32:48.405 --> 32:50.880
May God bless you all.

33:00.529 --> 33:04.655
So today we’ll have a Lakshmi pujan,
because of the Sea,

33:04.856 --> 33:09.065
and I think that will help everyone.
