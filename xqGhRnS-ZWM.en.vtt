00:02:20.051 --> 00:02:23.496
[Talk in Marathi for the first
14 minutes, then in English]

00:14:49.127 --> 00:14:51.025
We have come to this place many a times,

00:14:51.226 --> 00:14:52.993
this beautiful place, you all like it.

00:14:53.194 --> 00:14:56.775
It’s very rustic, absolutely in
the interior.

00:14:56.976 --> 00:15:01.076
Only thing is, coming all the way from
Ganapatipule,

00:15:01.277 --> 00:15:04.460
you have to spend lot of time.

00:15:05.539 --> 00:15:13.982
All this you are doing just to enjoy
the beauty of nature,

00:15:14.198 --> 00:15:16.795
and to be with the nature.

00:15:16.996 --> 00:15:25.749
I have told you already that this fruit
of coconut is called as Shriphala,

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:29.788
because it is the Sahasrara,

00:15:29.988 --> 00:15:33.161
and it’s very surprising

00:15:33.361 --> 00:15:36.297
that this fruit knows and understands.

00:15:36.498 --> 00:15:41.580
It won’t fall on any animal or on any
person.

00:15:41.781 --> 00:15:44.568
If you are sleeping here, it will never
fall on you.

00:15:44.768 --> 00:15:48.221
Nobody is hurt, ever, by this fruit.

00:15:48.422 --> 00:15:52.313
It is so sensible, more than human beings,

00:15:52.513 --> 00:15:55.539
because we do hurt others, we do trouble
others,

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.655
we don’t think what we are doing.

00:15:59.886 --> 00:16:05.036
But in Sahaja Yoga there’s lot of
sweetness, goodness, righteousness,

00:16:05.237 --> 00:16:08.667
and it’s so encouraging.

00:16:08.868 --> 00:16:11.968
Also so many people are there, newly
married.

00:16:12.169 --> 00:16:15.026
I congratulate them, all of them.

00:16:15.227 --> 00:16:18.082
Now try to be...

00:16:22.521 --> 00:16:24.566
Try to be kind to each other.

00:16:24.767 --> 00:16:28.267
If you are reserved in the beginning,
you’ll have to pay for it.

00:16:28.475 --> 00:16:32.399
Please try to be nice, kind and talkative;

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:38.403
not that you just keep quiet and don’t
talk to someone.

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:43.434
Maybe there’s sort of a way of impressing
others:

00:16:43.634 --> 00:16:45.821
not in our Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:46.022 --> 00:16:49.643
In Sahaja Yoga I talk too much, that’s why
My throat is off today,

00:16:49.844 --> 00:16:52.169
and you also talk.

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:57.776
Talking is very important, not hiding your
feelings.

00:16:57.977 --> 00:17:02.135
I have told lots of things about it, how
to make a marriage happy,

00:17:02.336 --> 00:17:04.561
that will make [you] very happy also.

00:17:04.762 --> 00:17:09.249
If you have very good marriages we’ll have
very good children born to you,

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:14.630
and then we’ll have a new race of people
in this world.

00:17:14.831 --> 00:17:18.245
These children will be the most powerful
things for us,

00:17:18.446 --> 00:17:20.201
and they’ll work out many things

00:17:20.401 --> 00:17:23.323
which we could not work out.

00:17:31.497 --> 00:17:37.244
Regarding our tour, I hope you have been
happy about it,

00:17:37.444 --> 00:17:41.653
and then you enjoyed all the programs
that we had.

00:17:53.413 --> 00:17:56.485
Today I am going to tell you something
about the sea,

00:17:56.686 --> 00:17:58.728
because we are next to the sea here,

00:17:58.929 --> 00:18:03.120
and must understand the feelings of a sea.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.918
Sea is your grandfather in a way,

00:18:06.119 --> 00:18:13.938
because he gave birth to Lakshmi, who
becomes Mahalakshmi later on.

00:18:14.139 --> 00:18:21.223
So this sea which is the grandfather, we
have to show all respect to him.

00:18:21.423 --> 00:18:30.594
Normally the way people are living, in
the West specially, also in India,

00:18:30.803 --> 00:18:35.864
people go and use it for bathrooms.

00:18:36.065 --> 00:18:39.529
But also in the West they use it in a very
funny way,

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:45.201
that they use it for swimming and all kinds
of things,

00:18:45.418 --> 00:18:48.184
by which they wear funny dresses

00:18:48.385 --> 00:18:52.630
and lead a very licentious life.

00:18:52.831 --> 00:18:55.541
This is an insult to the sea.

00:18:55.742 --> 00:19:00.345
We must respect the sea. In India we
worship the sea.

00:19:00.564 --> 00:19:04.545
We have to worship the sea. And in
the Greek mythology also

00:19:04.746 --> 00:19:10.296
they had a, as we have Varuna, they too had
a God for sea.

00:19:10.497 --> 00:19:14.741
So this God for sea has to be worshipped,

00:19:14.942 --> 00:19:18.932
and has to be understood and to be
respected.

00:19:19.133 --> 00:19:20.808
We cannot be disrespectful.

00:19:21.016 --> 00:19:24.727
Before entering into sea you must say
namaskar to the sea,

00:19:24.928 --> 00:19:29.064
and coming out of it also you must say
namaskar.

00:19:31.396 --> 00:19:35.283
The way we behave towards the sea is not
proper.

00:19:35.484 --> 00:19:39.415
As you know, because of sea we get rain.

00:19:39.616 --> 00:19:44.248
If there was no sea we would not have
rain, we would not have anything.

00:19:44.449 --> 00:19:47.684
Sea is so important to our life.

00:19:47.885 --> 00:19:50.036
The greatest thing is, sea is the Guru,

00:19:50.237 --> 00:19:55.017
is the Mahaguru which teaches us so many
things.

00:19:55.510 --> 00:20:01.262
First of all, this Mahaguru is the one,
creates salt for us.

00:20:01.463 --> 00:20:07.542
Christ has said: “You are the salt, salt
of the universe”;

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:11.958
meaning, you are the one which gives taste

00:20:12.158 --> 00:20:15.847
and all the qualities of the salt to
the human beings.

00:20:16.047 --> 00:20:19.899
So this sea is there, we have to learn
a lot from this sea.

00:20:20.099 --> 00:20:24.404
The first of all is that it has its own
maryadas.

00:20:24.605 --> 00:20:28.610
Supposing you try to press the sea from
this side,

00:20:28.811 --> 00:20:30.890
it will appear on the other side.

00:20:31.097 --> 00:20:33.239
It always keeps to its maryadas.

00:20:33.439 --> 00:20:37.592
Such a huge thing are these oceans –
are such huge,

00:20:37.792 --> 00:20:39.554
but they keep to their maryadas,

00:20:39.754 --> 00:20:43.279
they never cross their maryadas.

00:20:43.573 --> 00:20:50.880
While we just start encroaching on
everybody’s maryadas.

00:20:51.247 --> 00:20:53.867
So the maryadas of the sea is very
important –

00:20:54.084 --> 00:20:58.865
that it just keeps to its own line.

00:20:59.066 --> 00:21:02.385
You can draw the line when it is a high
tide,

00:21:02.586 --> 00:21:04.701
next day, whenever there will be a high
tide,

00:21:04.901 --> 00:21:07.620
it will be just there.

00:21:08.251 --> 00:21:11.398
So imagine such a huge thing like an ocean

00:21:11.599 --> 00:21:16.086
can keep itself to the same maryadas,

00:21:16.302 --> 00:21:19.612
why can’t we, with such a personality
of ours,

00:21:19.812 --> 00:21:24.611
should keep to ourselves and to our
maryadas?

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:30.079
Then the second quality of the sea is that
it looks after

00:21:30.279 --> 00:21:33.344
all the animals that are in it.

00:21:33.544 --> 00:21:37.447
Somehow it is a saltish thing, but there
are fishes

00:21:37.648 --> 00:21:42.816
and there are all kinds of animals which
exist in the sea,

00:21:43.017 --> 00:21:45.543
and that’s why it is, we should say,

00:21:45.744 --> 00:21:49.940
the first life came into being in the sea.

00:21:50.141 --> 00:21:53.479
So all our forefathers, long time back,

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.470
must have been born in the sea,

00:21:55.671 --> 00:21:58.425
and then we, now we have become human
beings.

00:21:58.626 --> 00:22:01.459
So we have no right to insult the sea,

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:04.797
where our forefathers must have existed

00:22:04.998 --> 00:22:07.776
and then they started coming out, one
by one

00:22:07.976 --> 00:22:13.321
as the fish came, as a reptile.

00:22:15.782 --> 00:22:23.781
Now the third quality of the sea is that
it is a deep thing,

00:22:23.981 --> 00:22:28.818
it is very deep. In some places is
extremely deep.

00:22:29.019 --> 00:22:32.652
If the depth of the sea is reduced

00:22:32.852 --> 00:22:40.947
even by few, few feet, there will be
problem all over.

00:22:41.147 --> 00:22:44.158
It keeps to its depth. It doesn’t leave
its depth.

00:22:44.359 --> 00:22:48.612
It keeps to its maryadas, and it keeps
to its depth.

00:22:48.813 --> 00:22:51.100
In the same way, whatever depth we have got

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.665
in Sahaja Yoga, we should keep to that.

00:22:53.866 --> 00:22:58.468
Normally we should not become cheap type
people,

00:22:58.669 --> 00:23:02.114
we cannot afford. We have to be deep people

00:23:02.314 --> 00:23:04.522
with deep understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

00:23:04.722 --> 00:23:06.618
deep understanding of ourselves,

00:23:06.819 --> 00:23:08.819
because that’s the sign of dignity.

00:23:09.019 --> 00:23:11.222
And that dignity you must have,

00:23:11.423 --> 00:23:15.631
that majestic nature of the sea you must
have.

00:23:15.832 --> 00:23:19.788
Now these trees as they are you see, are
very surprisingly,

00:23:19.988 --> 00:23:24.808
they are getting all the wind from the sea.

00:23:25.015 --> 00:23:27.739
But if you go nearer the sea when they are
planted,

00:23:27.939 --> 00:23:31.846
they all bend towards the sea, never away.

00:23:32.046 --> 00:23:38.106
They give their, sort of, gratitude by
bending towards the sea.

00:23:38.307 --> 00:23:40.657
Though the wind is blowing the other way
round,

00:23:40.858 --> 00:23:42.439
but they’re not bothered about the wind.

00:23:42.639 --> 00:23:46.531
Their gratitude is to the sea, so they bend
towards the sea.

00:23:46.731 --> 00:23:51.386
Even these trees understand what it is
like.

00:23:51.641 --> 00:23:54.536
Without the sea we could not have had
any transport

00:23:54.737 --> 00:23:57.142
from places to places as we have been,

00:23:57.342 --> 00:24:03.560
and also there is a great lot of wealth
inside the bed of the sea

00:24:03.761 --> 00:24:06.083
which is not yet explored; but once
explored,

00:24:06.284 --> 00:24:08.028
the whole world can be very rich.

00:24:08.229 --> 00:24:10.358
But they are fighting about it, which part
is ours,

00:24:10.559 --> 00:24:14.162
which part is yours; that in that fight do
you know, I think

00:24:14.363 --> 00:24:20.516
all this inside the sea might shift from
one place to another!

00:24:20.716 --> 00:24:24.610
And lots of wealth which is of…

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:29.985
which is like gold, silver, diamonds, are
all embedded in the sea.

00:24:30.186 --> 00:24:34.022
And one day may be that this Lakshmi might
be discovered,

00:24:34.222 --> 00:24:38.336
and we people will be enriched all over.

00:24:39.107 --> 00:24:41.863
Moreover when we carry the transport,

00:24:42.063 --> 00:24:46.285
we carry Lakshmi from one place to another,
from another place to this place,

00:24:46.486 --> 00:24:50.961
so the sea has given us that mobility and
movement.

00:24:51.621 --> 00:24:57.140
I have seen the sea reacts to Me very much.

00:24:57.341 --> 00:25:01.101
It reacts, because if there’s a light

00:25:01.302 --> 00:25:06.486
in the sea, or a moon, sun in the - moon
in the sea reflecting,

00:25:06.686 --> 00:25:09.553
it moves with Me, I’ve seen it, it moves
with Me.

00:25:09.754 --> 00:25:12.419
The sea understands Me very well,

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:17.745
because I have a special relationship and
a respect for that sea.

00:25:17.946 --> 00:25:22.738
Now when you are here, I hope you’ll
understand the value of the sea.

00:25:22.939 --> 00:25:25.308
Because of the sea you are so much enjoying
here,

00:25:25.508 --> 00:25:30.811
it is giving you such good feelings, and
all spirituality.

00:25:31.845 --> 00:25:35.332
There is no need to go to Himalayas.

00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:39.691
The – whatever is covering is in
the Himalayas,

00:25:39.891 --> 00:25:44.184
is what is nothing but the water from
the sea only.

00:25:44.385 --> 00:25:49.634
It’s one of the circles, that water passes
to the Himalayas,

00:25:49.843 --> 00:25:53.897
then comes back as rivers, again falls into
the same sea.

00:25:54.098 --> 00:25:59.682
They have to come to the sea. So it is
everything ends up here.

00:25:59.883 --> 00:26:04.801
And then it is allowed – it goes through
tapasya – it allows the Sun

00:26:05.002 --> 00:26:13.337
to create that cloud by suffering the heat,

00:26:13.537 --> 00:26:16.920
heat of the Sun, and becomes vapours,

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:22.125
and then it goes as clouds and you get your
rain.

00:26:22.326 --> 00:26:25.232
In the same way we have to be;

00:26:25.432 --> 00:26:29.141
we have to bear the heat of others,

00:26:29.341 --> 00:26:33.336
the anger of others and create vapours –

00:26:33.537 --> 00:26:36.372
means the blessings, the vibrations for
others.

00:26:36.572 --> 00:26:38.801
It is with Me, same thing.

00:26:39.002 --> 00:26:42.234
When I see somebody who is sick and I
treat him,

00:26:42.435 --> 00:26:46.956
of course I have to bear a little bit,
sometimes quite a lot,

00:26:47.266 --> 00:26:50.716
then I absorb it and then they become
vibrations.

00:26:50.916 --> 00:26:53.161
They just start flowing as vibrations.

00:26:53.361 --> 00:26:55.332
So this is what you have to learn from
the sea,

00:26:55.533 --> 00:26:57.988
which is very important for sahaja yogis,

00:26:58.189 --> 00:27:00.751
that you absorb everything, doesn’t matter.

00:27:00.952 --> 00:27:04.159
But don’t get attached to it, and let it
become vapours,

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:10.515
and the Sea can now become the vapours.

00:27:10.715 --> 00:27:13.444
As you all are here, all these vapours

00:27:13.644 --> 00:27:16.034
as vibrations should flow.

00:27:16.234 --> 00:27:19.945
This method you should try to understand
by courage.

00:27:20.145 --> 00:27:22.908
Because the other day when I was coming,
there was a lady sitting

00:27:23.109 --> 00:27:25.409
just on the way: “Mother, her feet

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:30.289
are out of order, or something gone wrong.
Please treat her.”

00:27:30.559 --> 00:27:32.886
Why should I treat? Why can’t you treat?

00:27:33.087 --> 00:27:36.135
Are you afraid to treat someone?

00:27:36.683 --> 00:27:39.384
Then there’s another one who comes up
to say: “Mother, You treat her.”

00:27:39.585 --> 00:27:40.978
Why can’t you treat?

00:27:41.179 --> 00:27:44.767
You all can treat them, you can help them,

00:27:44.968 --> 00:27:49.613
and you’ll be surprised, the more you’ll
treat them the better you will be.

00:27:49.814 --> 00:27:54.121
You should venture, you should have that
much courage to treat others.

00:27:54.322 --> 00:27:58.728
If you don’t treat others you won’t grow

00:27:58.928 --> 00:28:02.720
because that is what, like the sea, as you
have seen,

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:09.082
you become the vibrations. And when you
treat others there are more vibrations.

00:28:09.283 --> 00:28:11.077
Why should God give you vibrations

00:28:11.277 --> 00:28:15.478
if you are not going to use it? Simple
logic.

00:28:15.748 --> 00:28:20.541
Why should God give you light if you are
not going to use it?

00:28:20.741 --> 00:28:26.772
Christ has said that, “You don’t put light
under a measure.”

00:28:27.543 --> 00:28:31.969
That’s what we are doing when we are not
using our hands,

00:28:32.169 --> 00:28:35.788
our feet, our brains for Sahaja Yoga:

00:28:35.989 --> 00:28:38.738
we are not creating vibrations within
ourselves.

00:28:38.945 --> 00:28:42.997
The same body that is yours can just become
a bundle of vibrations,

00:28:43.198 --> 00:28:46.619
if you start using these vibrations.

00:28:47.342 --> 00:28:50.692
But if you don’t use these vibrations
you’ll have problems

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:53.873
problems all the time, and you will not
understand:

00:28:54.073 --> 00:28:56.492
“Why? I am doing everything, I am doing
this” –

00:28:56.693 --> 00:28:59.466
because you are not using your vibrations.

00:28:59.667 --> 00:29:03.587
You have to use your vibrations in every
way possible,

00:29:03.788 --> 00:29:06.900
whenever is possible, to help others

00:29:07.108 --> 00:29:10.450
to get all right, to get well.

00:29:12.554 --> 00:29:14.417
You can at the most take a bandhan if you
like,

00:29:14.617 --> 00:29:17.038
if you think that it might hurt you or
something,

00:29:17.238 --> 00:29:19.484
but at least use My photograph.

00:29:19.685 --> 00:29:23.271
And after the photograph you can just touch
the person, there’s no harm.

00:29:23.472 --> 00:29:29.695
After all, if you are afraid even of any
troubles,

00:29:29.895 --> 00:29:33.326
then what’s the use of becoming a sahaja
yogi?

00:29:34.707 --> 00:29:38.881
If the ship is not seaworthy, what’s
the use of making a ship?

00:29:39.081 --> 00:29:41.970
You have to be seaworthy.

00:29:43.479 --> 00:29:47.828
And that’s what you have to decide, that:
“We are going to be Sahaja Yoga worthy,

00:29:48.028 --> 00:29:51.401
and for that we are going to absorb all
the vibrations,

00:29:51.602 --> 00:29:54.303
we are going to take up everything upon
ourselves.”

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:57.606
Little trouble also they have, they’ll tell
Me ten times:

00:29:57.815 --> 00:29:59.786
“We went there, then this happened,

00:29:59.986 --> 00:30:02.222
then that happened, then this.”

00:30:02.423 --> 00:30:05.427
But I never tell you anything, what happens
to Me,

00:30:05.627 --> 00:30:09.255
how I came here, what was there; nothing!

00:30:09.471 --> 00:30:12.462
Because I know that all this is, whatever
I am doing,

00:30:12.663 --> 00:30:16.701
is created into vibrations. In the same way
have faith,

00:30:16.902 --> 00:30:21.157
that you are all just like the sea, like
the Mahaguru,

00:30:21.357 --> 00:30:26.083
and that whatever you are doing is creating
vibrations within you,

00:30:26.283 --> 00:30:29.999
by which you can save so many.

00:30:31.064 --> 00:30:33.796
It’s something like a cycle again, I said,

00:30:33.997 --> 00:30:37.111
that the more you give, the more you get.

00:30:37.312 --> 00:30:42.083
The more you use your vibrations, much more
you’ll get it.

00:30:42.284 --> 00:30:48.843
It’s a very nice cycle that is acting as it
has acted in the case of the sea,

00:30:49.044 --> 00:30:52.518
as I told you, that the water goes
to the Himalayas,

00:30:52.719 --> 00:30:56.051
comes back at rivers. In the same way

00:30:56.252 --> 00:31:01.453
manifold, manifold your vibrations will be
growing,

00:31:01.653 --> 00:31:06.194
and I would say that we should always use
our vibrations

00:31:06.394 --> 00:31:12.746
for helping others, for giving to many
things, to the plant, to the anything.

00:31:12.953 --> 00:31:14.808
I mean there were some people who brought
a plant:

00:31:15.008 --> 00:31:19.511
“Mother, give vibrations to that.” I said:
“Why don’t you give the vibrations?”

00:31:19.712 --> 00:31:21.640
There’s no need even to take vibrated
water.

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:25.196
You can vibrate yourself. That state has
to come,

00:31:25.397 --> 00:31:27.837
that you can vibrate your own water,

00:31:28.037 --> 00:31:29.891
you can vibrate the whole waters
everywhere,

00:31:30.092 --> 00:31:32.269
there’s no need to take vibrated water
from Me.

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:37.016
Maybe Mine is a little more, but doesn’t
matter!

00:31:45.143 --> 00:31:49.393
But you are so many, so what – compared
to Me, I’m only one.

00:31:49.594 --> 00:31:52.398
So all of you can work it out and do such
a lot;

00:31:52.599 --> 00:31:54.954
but have faith in yourself.

00:31:55.155 --> 00:31:56.848
As the sea has faith in itself,

00:31:57.048 --> 00:31:59.374
you should have complete faith in yourself.

00:31:59.589 --> 00:32:02.561
You must respect your Self Realization.

00:32:02.761 --> 00:32:06.587
Tell every day to yourself: “I am a sahaja
yogi.

00:32:06.788 --> 00:32:09.225
I am a yogi, I am a saint,

00:32:09.426 --> 00:32:13.620
I am a realised soul. I have to do this.

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:17.823
How can I do these other nonsensical
things? I have to do these good things.

00:32:18.023 --> 00:32:20.823
I have to talk to people in a sweet manner,

00:32:21.024 --> 00:32:25.338
I have to try to work it out this way.”

00:32:26.101 --> 00:32:33.719
It is actually your faith in yourself is
going to help.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:36.907
Your faith in yourself – that you are
a great sahaja yogi,

00:32:37.107 --> 00:32:42.580
that you are absolutely surrendered to your
Mother, works very fast.

00:32:42.788 --> 00:32:45.565
That faith you should have, that you are
a sahaja yogi.

00:32:45.766 --> 00:32:48.204
Nothing else is needed.

00:32:48.405 --> 00:32:50.880
May God bless you all.

00:33:00.529 --> 00:33:04.655
So today we’ll have a Lakshmi pujan,
because of the Sea,

00:33:04.856 --> 00:33:09.065
and I think that will help everyone.
