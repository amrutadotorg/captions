00:01.060 --> 00:06.430
Joining me right now is Shri Mataji and She
is known throughout the world as a saint.

00:06.430 --> 00:09.746
And that’s the first time that I have been
able to meet a saint.

00:09.746 --> 00:13.820
And you’re also a faith healer or psychic healer, I guess some
people call you.

00:13.820 --> 00:17.919
But when asked in a recent interview as to
whether or not you were a saint or considered

00:17.919 --> 00:22.040
yourself to be a saint, you had a very unusual
answer. Are you?

00:22.369 --> 00:27.580
Actually, you cannot certify yourself, isn’t
it, as anything?

00:27.580 --> 00:34.680
The quality of a saint is that he can make
other saints. If he can make others saints,

00:34.680 --> 00:38.440
then he’s a saint. Otherwise, it’s just
self-certification.

00:38.440 --> 00:40.889
Can you make other people saints?
- I think so.

00:40.889 --> 00:46.120
Yes. How would you define a saint or what would
another person become that would make him a saint?

00:46.283 --> 00:50.593
The person who becomes a saint develops a new awareness

00:50.593 --> 00:58.820
as a result of a living process
of evolution that he becomes the Spirit as

00:58.820 --> 01:02.575
described by Christ that: “You are to be
born again”.

01:02.575 --> 01:08.819
And in that, the awareness becomes: it's actualization. It’s not just mental projection but actualization,

01:09.020 --> 01:14.630
that you become a person who is Collectively Conscious.

01:14.630 --> 01:20.450
You mentioned Christ and yet you are from
an Eastern country being from India.

01:20.450 --> 01:22.022
Do you believe in Jesus Christ ?

01:22.022 --> 01:27.349
Of course, of course! He plays a very big role in your evolution. He is the gate as said.

01:27.490 --> 01:32.341
So then by your definition a saint could be
a person who might be a born-again Christian?

01:32.341 --> 01:36.210
Who might have taken the Collective
Consciousness of Jesus into their lives?

01:36.210 --> 01:40.245
You see, those who accept him mentally are
not born again.

01:40.245 --> 01:44.506
Though, it is a happening that has to take place.
Baptism is a happening.

01:44.506 --> 01:51.077
And that happening takes place when there’s a vital force within our sacrum bone which rises.

01:51.077 --> 01:57.600
You can actually feel the rising of that force it comes up
onto the fontanel bone area -where we baptize-

01:57.600 --> 02:00.249
and you feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

02:00.249 --> 02:02.799
Yes, they say that there’s a cool breeze.
-Breeze of the Holy Ghost

02:02.799 --> 02:03.799
That people feel.
-Yes

02:03.799 --> 02:09.001
And another of the interviews that I read
about you said that the interviewer who interviewed you

02:09.001 --> 02:12.319
that you put your hand above the interviewer.
-Yes.

02:12.319 --> 02:14.874
And he was able to also feel the cool breeze

02:14.874 --> 02:16.995
Yes, yes. And also, from the [hands]

02:17.002 --> 02:18.793
Can you give me the cool breeze?
I’ve been waiting all my life for that.

02:18.793 --> 02:20.330
Yes, I think you pass
-Yes, right?

02:20.330 --> 02:22.670
You were little upset in the beginning when
I saw you,

02:22.670 --> 02:24.430
I was upset this morning.
-And it’s all right.

02:24.430 --> 02:25.148
Yes.

02:25.148 --> 02:27.945
I think, but now you have cool down,
and it will work out in no time.

02:28.045 --> 02:29.400
So, will I get the cool breeze?
-Of course.

02:29.400 --> 02:30.599
Or do you have to touch me?

02:30.599 --> 02:35.765
No, no, no, no. It might help, talking to me,
you might get it, but actually, you feel it on your fingertips.

02:35.765 --> 02:41.254
As Muhammad Sahib has said that:
“At the time of Resurection, your hands will speak.”

02:41.254 --> 02:45.000
And for the first time
you feel that All-pervading subtle power,

02:45.000 --> 02:48.500
But you become something more than what you are.

02:48.500 --> 02:49.930
That’s the saint.

02:49.930 --> 02:54.909
You have healed many people how many would
you estimate they’ve healed in your lifetime?

02:54.909 --> 02:58.269
I don’t know how many, I’ve never kept
count out.

02:58.269 --> 02:59.420
Hundreds?
-Yes, at least.

02:59.420 --> 03:01.719
At least, at least hundreds.
-Yes, at least hundreds.

03:01.719 --> 03:04.989
But, actually, the people who become Saints
can also.

03:04.989 --> 03:12.150
So if you see Sahaja Yoga, it can be in thousands.
Because so many people who became prophets,

03:12.150 --> 03:13.150
they have done it.

03:13.150 --> 03:14.165
They are also healing other people.

03:14.165 --> 03:17.157
Yes, they are also. They are healing much more than myself nowadays.

03:17.270 --> 03:20.809
What type of diseases or things have you been
able to heal?

03:20.970 --> 03:24.739
Most of the incurable diseases get healed,
but it’s not a faith healing, in the sense

03:24.739 --> 03:28.759
you don’t have to have faith, or you don’t
have to believe into any things.

03:28.759 --> 03:33.579
There’s no blindness about it. There’s no blindness.
Actually, it’s a happening, as I told you,

03:33.579 --> 03:40.250
like a sprouting of the seed. As a seed sprouts,
in the same way, your awakening takes place.

03:40.250 --> 03:46.200
And by that, you get your parasympathetic nervous
system nourished. It’s a question of nourishment.

03:46.200 --> 03:49.730
Nourishment, that’s how it works out.

03:49.730 --> 03:55.150
You have made a lot of statements about Orthodox
religion, specifically Catholicism and Protestantism.

03:55.150 --> 03:56.375
Every “ism”.

03:56.375 --> 03:59.044
What do you feel about them? What sorts you about that honorship to them?

03:59.044 --> 04:01.223
All religions, you see, are nothing but philosophies.

04:01.223 --> 04:04.227
They are just philosophies. They are words,
words and words.

04:04.227 --> 04:10.996
As Christ Himself – now, let’s see, he said that,
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes".

04:10.996 --> 04:14.830
Can you find any Christian without adulterous eyes?
It’s rather difficult.

04:14.830 --> 04:18.180
Why? Why is it when he said so, why is it

04:18.180 --> 04:20.912
we cannot have those innocent eyes? We should
have!

04:20.912 --> 04:25.146
The reason is what he said that He is to be born again within you.”

04:25.146 --> 04:31.590
And there’s a specific place where
Christ is awakened when this force rises.

04:31.590 --> 04:35.960
And here, one of the articles I read said
that you felt that some of the Orthodox religions

04:35.960 --> 04:39.257
were based on ignorance and extremism. So
it sounded to me-

04:39.257 --> 04:40.494
Fanaticism.

04:40.494 --> 04:42.060
that you were being negative about them.

04:42.060 --> 04:46.559
No, not very negative. I should say, as a
mother, that they’re misled.

04:46.559 --> 04:48.288
They are misled people.
-Misled.

04:48.288 --> 04:51.468
Misled.You see, they just started thinking

04:51.468 --> 04:57.959
that by reading something or by praying it
will work out. You have to be connected first with God.

04:57.959 --> 04:59.490
So how do you get connected?

04:59.490 --> 05:03.597
Connected? God has placed everything within
you. Everything is within you.

05:03.597 --> 05:08.067
And it's only the person who is a saint can do it. It’s
like the Mother Earth:

05:08.067 --> 05:12.710
what you do is to put the seed in her and it sprouts it by itself. It’s your own.

05:12.710 --> 05:15.411
So it’s spontaneous, it’s living.

05:15.411 --> 05:20.330
There is an article from a London newspaper
that mentioned that a young boy 17 years old

05:20.330 --> 05:25.000
had been very badly injured, almost to the
point of being mangled on a motorcycle.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.600
And he was – let’s say- two miles away from
where you were. And yet he claims that he

05:29.600 --> 05:34.069
saw you come to him. He thought that you were
really there - apparently it was a vision -

05:34.069 --> 05:38.630
that you placed your hands on various parts
of his body and he was healed.

05:38.630 --> 05:42.732
[no sound]
The accident saw you there, but yet you were there.

05:42.732 --> 05:44.112
How?
-It’s true, it works out.

05:44.112 --> 05:45.332
How can you explain that?

05:45.332 --> 05:52.466
You see, we must know that in the realm of God all your telecommunication television, is so efficient,

05:52.466 --> 05:59.070
it works, you see. Just like I’m sitting here, but I’m there
and I’m everywhere as then you can see it.

05:59.070 --> 06:02.455
In the same way, in his “television” they
have arrangements like that

06:02.455 --> 06:04.716
and you can work it out. It’s simple.

06:05.218 --> 06:09.109
One other thing you said is that you are able
to cure AIDS. How?

06:09.310 --> 06:17.300
Yes, it could be cured because it’s a -what
I have seen through this Collective Consciousness,

06:17.300 --> 06:21.636
that AIDS is caused by the combination of
three subtle centres within us.

06:21.636 --> 06:27.453
And if these three centers can be nourished, it can be
cured. I think one fellow got cured in London.

06:27.590 --> 06:32.530
But you also said in another interview something
to the effect that if you, if everyone became

06:32.630 --> 06:37.000
Collectively Conscious or at one with you
or as sane as you want to put it, that there

06:37.000 --> 06:42.099
would be no more homosexuality. So, are you
saying then that homosexuality is a negative thing?

06:42.099 --> 06:43.660
No, it is unnatural.

06:43.660 --> 06:45.637
Unnatural?
-It is not natural.

06:45.637 --> 06:50.231
The thing is, when they get homosexual, it is because of the forced conditions.

06:50.231 --> 06:52.718
For example, say, you see, if

06:52.820 --> 06:56.900
they see the women are too dominating, it’s
difficult to carry on with them, they are

06:56.900 --> 07:03.122
not any more women, there are more men, you
see, so they prefer men who are womanish sort of thing,

07:03.122 --> 07:05.740
it’s a mixture. The society is quite mixed up.

07:05.740 --> 07:10.497
Or also can be possible sometimes a man can
be possessed by a woman,

07:10.497 --> 07:14.870
and she might – he might behave like that.
It’s a complicated personality.

07:14.870 --> 07:19.880
Jerry Falwell was on her show last week, I
believe a week before, he said that the natural

07:19.880 --> 07:25.100
state that would cure a lot of things is monogamy:
one man for one woman. Do you agree?

07:25.100 --> 07:29.050
Of course! I mean, that’s natural to be like
that! No problems.

07:29.050 --> 07:33.943
He said that our society has become too promiscuous
and that’s why that we have all these new diseases.

07:33.943 --> 07:37.734
Yes. You see the thing is, we are on an ego-oriented society

07:37.734 --> 07:41.949
and where we think: “What’s wrong?”
But we don’t see the whole,

07:41.949 --> 07:48.333
we just see part of it, you see. And ego can
never lead us to right things. Our Self is the one

07:48.333 --> 07:52.317
that gives us all the security, all
the wisdom, all the guidance.

07:52.317 --> 07:55.793
And then we just become monogamous automatically. I don’t have to tell.

07:55.793 --> 07:58.804
Most people who became prophets, as I said, got cured

07:58.804 --> 08:02.440
they become monogamous. They were,
some of them were homosexuals,

08:02.440 --> 08:04.539
they became normal people they got married.

08:04.539 --> 08:09.939
Okay. We are out of time. I’d love to chat
with you more some of your ideas are very,

08:09.939 --> 08:14.110
very fascinating. For those of you that would
like to go and intend a free lecture, I don’t

08:14.110 --> 08:18.660
know if we can call “lecture”, but experience
with Shri Mataji, there are three meetings

08:18.660 --> 08:22.319
that shall be available to- you’ll be able
to see her here in Los Angeles. First this

08:22.319 --> 08:26.821
Saturday at the First Methodist Church on
Franklin Avenue right here in Hollywood. And

08:26.821 --> 08:31.560
also then again on Monday and on Tuesday,
and that’s at 7 o’clock. So, this Saturday,

08:31.560 --> 08:34.297
first United Methodist Church of Hollywood.
Thank you very much.

08:34.297 --> 08:35.255
Thank you.

08:35.255 --> 08:36.518
It was such an experience here!

08:36.518 --> 08:37.133
Thank you.

08:37.133 --> 08:37.633
OK.
