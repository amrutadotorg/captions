00:09:39.161 --> 00:09:41.418
About which he doesn't know.

00:09:44.888 --> 00:09:47.942
Although in our India

00:09:48.728 --> 00:09:51.144
there has been a lot of work on Yoga

00:09:52.059 --> 00:09:54.591
but because of the onset of English rule

00:09:55.279 --> 00:09:57.426
all of us

00:09:58.325 --> 00:10:00.532
forgot our Great scriptures

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.420
which worked a lot in the field of yoga.

00:10:05.024 --> 00:10:09.001
In Upanishads if you see particularly Shandilya Upanishad etc.,

00:10:10.053 --> 00:10:13.302
it has been written long back that within you

00:10:13.551 --> 00:10:16.119
there is a power named kundalini

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.162
and this power on getting awakened

00:10:19.866 --> 00:10:22.334
you can get your self realisation.

00:10:23.135 --> 00:10:24.731
This I will say certainly that

00:10:25.148 --> 00:10:28.085
very clearly whole outline

00:10:28.853 --> 00:10:31.249
has not been given in these Upnishads.

00:10:32.042 --> 00:10:35.604
But it is a matter of controversy

00:10:35.697 --> 00:10:38.282
that our many scriptures, Yogvashishth etc.,

00:10:38.483 --> 00:10:40.603
in many scriptures as well

00:10:40.735 --> 00:10:43.501
it has very clearly been mentioned.

00:10:45.893 --> 00:10:51.009
Don't know why do we  consider

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.704
knowledge from foreign countries

00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:59.806
as the best

00:11:00.149 --> 00:11:05.353
and our any asset in this country

00:11:05.782 --> 00:11:06.882
give it least importance

00:11:07.759 --> 00:11:09.487
don't know its importance.

00:11:09.936 --> 00:11:14.066
Its reason may be is that we were under slavery for such a long time

00:11:14.282 --> 00:11:18.318
and we were overwhelmed by these people because they were ruling us.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:24.056
Now that we are free

00:11:24.766 --> 00:11:27.260
in that freedom we should observe

00:11:27.575 --> 00:11:29.879
what are our assests

00:11:29.944 --> 00:11:32.744
what is our history

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:38.071
and what did we discover?

00:11:38.832 --> 00:11:44.628
India is such a unique country where

00:11:45.674 --> 00:11:51.830
man has  less problems of the outside world

00:11:52.041 --> 00:11:54.230
For example, if in London you have to go out of your home

00:11:54.567 --> 00:11:57.797
at least for fifteen, twenty minutes you have to dress up yourself

00:11:57.998 --> 00:11:59.461
then you can go out.

00:11:59.967 --> 00:12:03.447
In our country too there are so many places

00:12:05.139 --> 00:12:08.534
for example, Himalayas or at high altitudes

00:12:08.735 --> 00:12:12.283
where it is very cold, people don't live there.

00:12:13.139 --> 00:12:18.028
But I have seen in these countries that the problems

00:12:19.362 --> 00:12:26.124
quarelling with everyone all the time go on troubling them so much

00:12:26.711 --> 00:12:31.704
that they are fully lost in that.

00:12:32.095 --> 00:12:36.255
But in India the climate is so good that we sit in open.

00:12:37.425 --> 00:12:39.837
In Russia also you cannot sit in the open.

00:12:40.373 --> 00:12:43.506
In any country one cannot sit so much in the open.

00:12:43.764 --> 00:12:45.727
There used to sleep on the floor

00:12:45.928 --> 00:12:48.065
They said, Mother, many people will come to listen to your lecture

00:12:48.266 --> 00:12:49.320
there is no other place than a stadium.

00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:51.020
Stadium too was full to its capacity.

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:54.836
So this characteristic of India that

00:12:55.037 --> 00:12:56.981
there is neither too much heat nor too cold

00:12:57.246 --> 00:13:01.073
and here at this place we didn't have to struggle against nature.

00:13:02.612 --> 00:13:09.588
So from eternity there were our ancestors.

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:15.146
Those ancestors thought that finally our life is a daily affair.

00:13:15.347 --> 00:13:19.421
Daily we get crushed in our life.

00:13:19.622 --> 00:13:21.464
It has some or the other meaning.

00:13:21.899 --> 00:13:25.681
And because our climate was like that

00:13:25.882 --> 00:13:31.248
people definitely paid their attention more towards themselves

00:13:31.389 --> 00:13:34.259
than towards foreign countries.

00:13:34.853 --> 00:13:38.112
They didn't have any need to think about

00:13:38.313 --> 00:13:39.898
the questions of outside topics

00:13:40.099 --> 00:13:41.483
how to find out a solution of those problems?

00:13:41.697 --> 00:13:43.135
They knew only this much that

00:13:43.336 --> 00:13:46.321
now everything boarding and lodging is almost okay.

00:13:46.399 --> 00:13:49.180
Even if you go into jungles, you can live in jungles too.

00:13:49.381 --> 00:13:51.714
There you can live by eating fruits and berries.

00:13:51.798 --> 00:13:54.220
This type of climate too

00:13:54.312 --> 00:14:00.009
we should say that God has blessed us specially of such a country.

00:14:00.448 --> 00:14:02.801
This country is a great country

00:14:03.002 --> 00:14:06.565
and there is a special blessing of God for this country

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:10.420
and because of this blessing

00:14:10.858 --> 00:14:15.309
from eternity people of this country tried to find out

00:14:15.399 --> 00:14:18.472
why did we come in this world?

00:14:19.068 --> 00:14:23.780
And what for our life God has made?

00:14:23.981 --> 00:14:27.346
Why has He created us in the form of human beings?

00:14:28.135 --> 00:14:36.017
With this inspiration many people meditated in the jungles.

00:14:36.396 --> 00:14:39.895
They found out that our life has been created

00:14:40.208 --> 00:14:42.591
so that, we could go to the kingdom of God

00:14:43.396 --> 00:14:49.105
and their joy, and their love may be rewarded by that.

00:14:50.859 --> 00:14:56.272
God created the whole world and this universe.

00:14:56.361 --> 00:15:01.100
and after that left a human being from amoeba to this state

00:15:01.301 --> 00:15:05.022
and that only for the sake of being in that state of happiness

00:15:05.949 --> 00:15:10.838
that God's love and comfort we may be able to feel.

00:15:10.846 --> 00:15:13.809
So, God created this world.

00:15:15.438 --> 00:15:18.477
Every body sang this and everbody said

00:15:19.473 --> 00:15:24.395
saints in this Maharashtra, nobody knows in how many ways have said

00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:30.108
that SUKHAKA SANSAR (comfortable world) I will make.

00:15:30.606 --> 00:15:35.886
That has been explained in PSAYDAN (written by Sant Mauli Dnyaneshwar)

00:15:36.042 --> 00:15:40.334
and the beautiful picture of the world that he made

00:15:40.484 --> 00:15:44.061
that you can see today in sahajyoga.

00:15:45.032 --> 00:15:49.132
Whatever prophesy has been made, whatever has been said,

00:15:49.201 --> 00:15:52.155
whatever they desired by heart

00:15:52.356 --> 00:15:55.069
the time has come to be rewarded by success.

00:15:56.846 --> 00:15:59.188
I will say that Sahajyoga

00:15:59.389 --> 00:16:01.618
is not today's, it is from the beginning of the creation.

00:16:02.348 --> 00:16:10.463
In the olden times, there used to be only one guru and one disciple.

00:16:11.918 --> 00:16:16.032
This tradition in twefth century, specially in Maharashtra

00:16:19.576 --> 00:16:21.584
Shri Ghyaneshwar ji broke.

00:16:21.785 --> 00:16:25.925
He too after propitiating his brother,who was his Guru

00:16:26.126 --> 00:16:27.305
broke this tradition.

00:16:27.608 --> 00:16:33.433
Atleast  to Me about this clearly in Ghyaneshwari.........

00:16:34.063 --> 00:16:38.308
Before that you see nobody knows in how many scriptures

00:16:38.395 --> 00:16:39.516
there is no mention about it.

00:16:39.717 --> 00:16:42.520
and about that it has been specifically explained.

00:16:43.172 --> 00:16:45.718
Those who had never read Sanskrit

00:16:45.901 --> 00:16:48.301
those who did not see their old books

00:16:48.502 --> 00:16:57.566
those who give western education highest importance.

00:16:57.767 --> 00:17:01.101
are blind people, will never be able to understand it

00:17:01.109 --> 00:17:04.947
that in this country how many great things are there

00:17:06.931 --> 00:17:08.701
In all these things

00:17:10.719 --> 00:17:14.786
Whatever you will come across, that is only just one thing

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:18.921
what for is a man's life made?

00:17:19.122 --> 00:17:20.670
What is its meaning?

00:17:21.257 --> 00:17:22.715
Where has he to go?

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:28.382
Is his life made for fighting with this and that

00:17:28.391 --> 00:17:31.263
solving the problems, go on quarrelling and abusing people

00:17:31.464 --> 00:17:34.917
or go on depositing insurance policies

00:17:35.035 --> 00:17:36.867
or do some better work than this

00:17:37.068 --> 00:17:39.271
and grab the money of the whole world

00:17:40.021 --> 00:17:41.778
Is his life made for that?

00:17:42.686 --> 00:17:44.349
We should think

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.899
Is our life made for such petty things?

00:17:48.272 --> 00:17:50.756
When I came to Poona in the beginning, everybody told ME

00:17:50.957 --> 00:17:53.212
"Mother, here your work will not be done at all". I said ,"Why?"

00:17:53.413 --> 00:17:56.203
They said ,"They all eat money. They don't eat food at all."

00:17:56.711 --> 00:17:58.611
But, this Punya Patnam

00:17:58.812 --> 00:18:04.617
about this it is mentioned in so many scriptures

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.128
In this Punya Patnam, do all people eat only money?

00:18:08.803 --> 00:18:10.394
Has all bribery spread?

00:18:11.278 --> 00:18:12.647
Why has it happened?

00:18:12.866 --> 00:18:15.357
Why did we reduce ourselves to such a state?

00:18:15.478 --> 00:18:20.577
Because that which is desire within us to seek truth disappeared.

00:18:21.997 --> 00:18:25.242
We lost that desire, we are unable to understand that

00:18:25.638 --> 00:18:28.831
that we have to find out the truth

00:18:29.152 --> 00:18:31.721
Till we do not find out the truth

00:18:31.917 --> 00:18:35.048
till then we can never get solution.

00:18:35.188 --> 00:18:36.830
You become a millioner

00:18:36.916 --> 00:18:39.318
you eat lot of money , become a millioner

00:18:39.589 --> 00:18:42.957
but you can never get health.

00:18:43.202 --> 00:18:45.404
You can never get happiness.

00:18:45.605 --> 00:18:46.910
You cannot get love

00:18:47.111 --> 00:18:50.341
and everybody will speak against you at your back.

00:18:51.599 --> 00:18:58.278
Not only this, people in this India are acquainted with great ideals

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.875
that any person may get tempted

00:19:01.076 --> 00:19:05.286
to bow his head to the photograph, however great he may be.

00:19:06.004 --> 00:19:09.344
We are the carriers of such a great culture.

00:19:09.597 --> 00:19:12.574
Having such a great culture

00:19:12.899 --> 00:19:16.677
Why have we gone down and now

00:19:16.794 --> 00:19:20.212
is there any way to escape is a separate question?

00:19:20.322 --> 00:19:23.927
If somebody asks Me, I will say that it is good in one way

00:19:24.128 --> 00:19:27.451
that it has at least created an illusion within us.

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:30.479
We started thinking why did we fall like that?

00:19:31.203 --> 00:19:32.926
Why are we facing this plight

00:19:33.127 --> 00:19:36.090
and why are we doing it at a low level?

00:19:37.429 --> 00:19:38.429
Above all

00:19:40.512 --> 00:19:46.050
when a man thinks what after this? After all why this?

00:19:46.164 --> 00:19:48.108
And then he becomes a seeker.

00:19:48.309 --> 00:19:50.569
And those who are seekers

00:19:50.823 --> 00:19:53.731
only he can get self realisation.

00:19:54.189 --> 00:19:56.947
and he who is not (a seeker) he may say anything

00:19:57.148 --> 00:19:59.616
however he may shout, he cannot get his self realisation.

00:19:59.961 --> 00:20:01.061
He is not a realised soul.

00:20:02.288 --> 00:20:05.138
Because when a person thinks in this direction,

00:20:05.339 --> 00:20:08.048
after all why did he come in this world?

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:10.676
he points towards the truth

00:20:11.255 --> 00:20:13.933
and he wants to know the truth.

00:20:14.201 --> 00:20:17.561
I who am born as a human being, what is its importance?

00:20:17.772 --> 00:20:20.429
what is my status?

00:20:20.594 --> 00:20:24.120
To which level i am going?

00:20:24.251 --> 00:20:27.148
When a human being starts thinking all this

00:20:27.362 --> 00:20:29.327
he becomes a seeker.

00:20:29.534 --> 00:20:31.360
and when he becomes a seeker

00:20:31.557 --> 00:20:36.492
then for him, his kundalini, his own mother herself

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:38.840
that is settled within him, gets enlightened in a sahaj way.

00:20:39.942 --> 00:20:43.582
In this case, in Russia I tell you, is so surprising

00:20:43.783 --> 00:20:47.929
that 14 Thousand and 16 thousand, there are also such people

00:20:48.132 --> 00:20:50.088
and all of them get realisation.

00:20:50.319 --> 00:20:53.701
I used to think that there they had never heard the name of God

00:20:53.881 --> 00:20:56.676
not knowing what is kundalini.

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:58.401
Seeing just My photograph

00:20:58.602 --> 00:21:01.598
thousands of people came and got realisation.

00:21:01.891 --> 00:21:05.320
I observed that all their writers are

00:21:05.521 --> 00:21:10.897
too much in search of their inner mind, by introspection

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:13.833
Their writers have shown that whatever work a man does

00:21:14.034 --> 00:21:16.133
always gropes for an answer.

00:21:16.335 --> 00:21:19.581
Why i do this? why i did this? what for i am doiing so?

00:21:19.782 --> 00:21:21.570
What is my intention?

00:21:22.363 --> 00:21:23.397
So,

00:21:24.574 --> 00:21:27.531
although in our country, people talk a lot about religion,

00:21:27.732 --> 00:21:28.802
have a great command on dharma

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:33.379
and you have just seen that sadam sahib and  America

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:36.968
has spoiled the show in the name of God, all the work

00:21:38.664 --> 00:21:40.853
quarrelling, create trouble

00:21:41.054 --> 00:21:43.370
kill this, kill that, supress everybody.

00:21:44.186 --> 00:21:46.061
All this is happening

00:21:46.262 --> 00:21:49.696
because a human being is not secured within himself.

00:21:50.449 --> 00:21:54.266
He doesn't know that God takes care of everybody's security

00:21:54.736 --> 00:21:55.883
But He loves everyone.

00:21:56.084 --> 00:21:59.524
Not only this, He is the Father of all fathers

00:22:00.548 --> 00:22:01.548
Absolute

00:22:03.768 --> 00:22:05.518
Ocean of mercy

00:22:05.918 --> 00:22:09.902
And we need not be insecured so much.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:14.121
And simply by My saying you may accept that thing, is not possible

00:22:14.419 --> 00:22:19.841
that I say that God's shelter is always spread over you.

00:22:21.185 --> 00:22:24.419
But you can surely feel it

00:22:24.626 --> 00:22:28.122
You can know it, in Marathi it is called ZANI.

00:22:28.348 --> 00:22:30.580
In Sanskrit it is called BODH

00:22:30.781 --> 00:22:33.189
or VIDH from which the word 'VED' has originated.

00:22:34.189 --> 00:22:37.557
The time has come that you can know it

00:22:37.758 --> 00:22:41.113
that it that God's grace is spread all around us.

00:22:42.417 --> 00:22:47.465
And when we get this power, then only

00:22:48.079 --> 00:22:49.886
In fact

00:22:50.087 --> 00:22:52.125
your yoga takes place.

00:22:52.524 --> 00:22:55.950
Before that, to talk about yoga, to stand on your head

00:22:56.151 --> 00:22:58.568
and to break your bones is not yoga.

00:22:59.705 --> 00:23:02.300
And people made yogas of different types.

00:23:02.845 --> 00:23:05.813
Yoga is not made, it takes place.

00:23:06.668 --> 00:23:11.126
which is living action in our evolution

00:23:11.522 --> 00:23:13.478
just as we became human beings

00:23:13.767 --> 00:23:17.877
you have not been turned into human being from a monkey

00:23:18.078 --> 00:23:19.483
you became so.

00:23:19.504 --> 00:23:23.426
the same way, from the state of a human being

00:23:23.627 --> 00:23:25.757
you go to a higher state.

00:23:26.052 --> 00:23:29.846
and to go that state you didn't have to work hard

00:23:30.221 --> 00:23:31.825
you didn't have to undergo any hardship

00:23:31.942 --> 00:23:35.142
You didnn't have to pay any money

00:23:35.343 --> 00:23:38.949
The main thing is that God doesn't understand money at all.

00:23:39.075 --> 00:23:40.912
What will He do after taking money?

00:23:41.177 --> 00:23:43.935
What is the need of offering money in His name?

00:23:44.376 --> 00:23:47.012
The person who values money most

00:23:47.091 --> 00:23:48.945
What is the use of giving money to him?

00:23:49.146 --> 00:23:50.980
For example, this land is earth

00:23:51.181 --> 00:23:53.788
put any seed into it, it will sprout on its own.

00:23:53.813 --> 00:23:55.620
The same way

00:23:55.821 --> 00:24:01.240
kundalini awakening takes place on its own in a sahaj way

00:24:02.757 --> 00:24:04.939
But such things people explain

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:10.790
that for kundalini jagran you do this, you do that

00:24:10.853 --> 00:24:12.629
you give so much money,do this do that

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:15.116
it is all false, absolutely false

00:24:15.319 --> 00:24:17.655
Do not trust such people at all

00:24:17.718 --> 00:24:21.938
And those who take money in the name of God, commit sin.

00:24:22.856 --> 00:24:24.425
They commit the greatest sin.

00:24:24.581 --> 00:24:26.743
And those who give, it will be said about you

00:24:26.944 --> 00:24:29.106
that your wisdom will be helpful.

00:24:30.831 --> 00:24:33.878
Another thing is that for this Sahaj

00:24:34.464 --> 00:24:37.182
because as I said that a seed

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.705
by a living process only

00:24:39.827 --> 00:24:43.738
gets germinated, the same way it is a living process

00:24:44.076 --> 00:24:47.052
which is the work of living God.

00:24:47.755 --> 00:24:51.538
To that, even if you make it as per your desire, is not possible

00:24:54.915 --> 00:24:58.080
That sitting inside you is your indivisual mother.

00:24:58.729 --> 00:25:02.501
Kundalini is your mother.Many people have even written that

00:25:02.687 --> 00:25:04.221
that with the awakening of kundalini

00:25:04.422 --> 00:25:06.369
you face this problem, that problem

00:25:06.486 --> 00:25:07.769
I can't understand

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:09.918
if you don't know anything about a particular field

00:25:10.119 --> 00:25:11.413
then why do you write about it.

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:13.967
People go on writing to earn any amount of money

00:25:14.294 --> 00:25:15.539
and write such things that people feel scared

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:17.605
that we will not have  Kundalini awakening

00:25:17.848 --> 00:25:18.765
we will have problems.

00:25:18.965 --> 00:25:20.718
Oh! She is your mother.

00:25:20.874 --> 00:25:22.925
because She is going to give you, your rebirth.

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:27.100
Your mother who gave you birth, did she not take all the troubles?

00:25:27.204 --> 00:25:29.042
Had she given you any trouble?

00:25:29.416 --> 00:25:31.320
The same way SHe is your mother.

00:25:31.524 --> 00:25:34.018
And this Mother is mother of pure desire.

00:25:34.666 --> 00:25:36.856
If you have pure desire

00:25:37.364 --> 00:25:39.794
that pure desire is in the form of Mother

00:25:39.995 --> 00:25:43.486
is a power and when this power awakens

00:25:43.645 --> 00:25:50.387
then you witness the love of that all pervading power of God

00:25:50.725 --> 00:25:53.318
or we must say that we witness that power.

00:25:53.967 --> 00:25:57.177
That power you can feel inside you

00:25:57.378 --> 00:26:00.029
you can also see it on your head

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:03.873
that cool breeze is coming out of your head

00:26:04.566 --> 00:26:06.464
as Adi shankaracharya ji has said,"SALEELAM SALEELEM."

00:26:07.192 --> 00:26:09.633
This way you can feel it in fingers as well

00:26:09.834 --> 00:26:11.442
although now a days

00:26:12.988 --> 00:26:16.979
it has opened for the whole world. It was not so earlier.

00:26:17.403 --> 00:26:22.400
So, people have not explained it so openly.

00:26:22.982 --> 00:26:27.198
But now it is available for everybody and everybody can get it.

00:26:27.429 --> 00:26:31.936
But in that there are two types of confusions.

00:26:32.127 --> 00:26:34.045
Which is specially in India.

00:26:34.246 --> 00:26:37.814
That is within us there are SUSANSKARS (good as well as)

00:26:38.015 --> 00:26:40.137
KUSANSKARS ( bad, moral and cultural values) .

00:26:40.644 --> 00:26:43.407
Out of those KUSANSKARS, one such is

00:26:43.524 --> 00:26:47.322
that we have got entangled in the bondage of some religious cult.

00:26:48.146 --> 00:26:49.561
To be in Dharma is different from

00:26:49.762 --> 00:26:52.155
being in the bondage of some Dharma.

00:26:53.599 --> 00:26:57.289
To be in Dharma means first that you are your own master.

00:26:57.733 --> 00:27:01.818
No need to say follow Dharma or be in Dharma.

00:27:01.848 --> 00:27:05.102
For example, if there is a saint like Tukaram,

00:27:06.142 --> 00:27:08.829
as Namdev was, as was...........Sant Garib Das

00:27:09.417 --> 00:27:11.341
as was Kabir, as Nanaka was

00:27:11.792 --> 00:27:14.648
Had they to be told,"Don't do this wrong act

00:27:14.849 --> 00:27:16.366
don't do this, don't grab money? "

00:27:16.567 --> 00:27:19.218
Had they to be told like that? There was no need of that.

00:27:19.555 --> 00:27:21.362
They would not do wrong acts at all.

00:27:21.505 --> 00:27:25.209
Then they had some such  special personality having their own power.

00:27:25.228 --> 00:27:28.505
on account of which they would not bother for such things

00:27:28.566 --> 00:27:31.311
would condemn such petty issues.

00:27:31.718 --> 00:27:34.123
That thing you are going to get today.

00:27:34.971 --> 00:27:37.110
You can get it today.

00:27:37.213 --> 00:27:41.608
So, because the God who has created this universe

00:27:41.809 --> 00:27:47.575
He is eager, He only wants you to get your self realisation.

00:27:47.858 --> 00:27:51.084
Today I  am going to tell you something special

00:27:52.265 --> 00:27:55.625
yesterday was as you know people recognise was a day of Gudi Padwa.

00:27:56.094 --> 00:28:01.804
On the day of Gudi Padwa, people say that Krita yuga started

00:28:01.859 --> 00:28:03.742
Now the people will say, it is all foolishness.

00:28:03.943 --> 00:28:05.899
How did krita yuga start?

00:28:05.921 --> 00:28:07.986
Krita yuga started in Kaliyuga

00:28:08.187 --> 00:28:15.796
means that in Kaliyuga this all pervading power of God is working.

00:28:16.195 --> 00:28:18.940
and because of its working only

00:28:19.154 --> 00:28:22.290
today Sahajyoga has become so simple and easy.

00:28:22.491 --> 00:28:24.907
And people have been benifitted in many ways.

00:28:25.157 --> 00:28:27.611
Now if you don't want to take the advantage of it

00:28:27.812 --> 00:28:29.951
no body can compel you.

00:28:30.101 --> 00:28:33.811
So for this,for some days you must have a

00:28:34.013 --> 00:28:38.429
hankering, a desire and a little bit of dedication.

00:28:38.443 --> 00:28:40.431
because may be you are very egoistic saying

00:28:40.632 --> 00:28:43.953
"We will give you two lakh, you awaken our kundalini"

00:28:44.014 --> 00:28:47.268
Cannot do all, you may give ten lakh, twenty five lakh.

00:28:47.597 --> 00:28:50.858
No problem! If you want your kundalini to be awakened

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.037
then come with humility

00:28:53.428 --> 00:28:56.670
and say that you want your kundalini to be awakened

00:28:56.731 --> 00:28:57.731
It will be instantaneously.

00:28:58.291 --> 00:29:00.769
A person who is full of arrogance

00:29:00.951 --> 00:29:03.525
or a person full of KUSANSKAR (wrong moral values)

00:29:03.588 --> 00:29:06.899
that person finds it difficult in Sahaj yoga

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:09.227
still I wonder

00:29:09.337 --> 00:29:12.096
that Kundalini's work  is going on so efficiently.

00:29:12.185 --> 00:29:15.232
People are getting benifitted limitlessly that

00:29:15.433 --> 00:29:20.891
don't know how God is so merciful to us.

00:29:21.076 --> 00:29:24.507
And many a times we think

00:29:24.708 --> 00:29:27.846
how did He pour His ocean of compassion on us.

00:29:28.067 --> 00:29:31.453
It is worth knowing, It is worth recognising.

00:29:31.654 --> 00:29:34.526
In the modern age people are so much overwhelmed by science

00:29:34.727 --> 00:29:39.225
although in India, the scientists are half baked scientists.

00:29:39.952 --> 00:29:43.210
that is why here people talk more about science.

00:29:43.749 --> 00:29:46.695
So, to this even the scientists

00:29:48.292 --> 00:29:51.709
when they thought that beyound this they don't need anything

00:29:52.832 --> 00:29:55.172
and this science is not the last thing

00:29:55.331 --> 00:29:57.823
there must be definitely something beyond this

00:29:58.135 --> 00:30:01.434
and when they took even one single step of religion

00:30:02.405 --> 00:30:04.528
and God knows how much they progressed

00:30:04.556 --> 00:30:05.764
and I would like to say

00:30:05.965 --> 00:30:10.084
that in America and Russia there are many scientists

00:30:10.123 --> 00:30:12.325
who took a big step in Sahaj Yoga

00:30:12.596 --> 00:30:14.836
and they discovered a lot.

00:30:15.176 --> 00:30:17.430
Towards this we should see that

00:30:17.631 --> 00:30:20.610
everything that has proof people ask for.

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:22.611
Give the proof of this, of that. Why should we give?

00:30:22.812 --> 00:30:24.775
Have we charged any money, any rupee from you?

00:30:25.315 --> 00:30:26.806
What for are you asking?

00:30:27.033 --> 00:30:28.556
Of what are you the contractors

00:30:28.757 --> 00:30:29.999
that you ask for the proof of everything?

00:30:30.328 --> 00:30:33.585
First you come and get your realisation.

00:30:34.216 --> 00:30:36.943
But if you want us to give its proof, we won't give.

00:30:37.144 --> 00:30:38.121
Why should we give?

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.435
We are not your servants.

00:30:40.762 --> 00:30:44.885
But when you say ,"Mother please give us self realisation,

00:30:45.086 --> 00:30:47.745
I will be your servant for all times to come".

00:30:48.307 --> 00:30:51.449
Because, there is one bad thing in a human being

00:30:52.215 --> 00:30:54.238
and that is his 'ego".

00:30:54.751 --> 00:31:00.724
its one type of behaviour, which is not liked by Kundalini.

00:31:01.808 --> 00:31:02.786
Kundalini doesn't want

00:31:02.987 --> 00:31:06.567
you to visit and abuse saints in front of them.

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.455
Do you think that kundalini doesn't understand all this?

00:31:09.712 --> 00:31:12.309
This all pervading power is

00:31:12.624 --> 00:31:19.342
this, you don't knowthat it neither thinks, it knows

00:31:19.584 --> 00:31:23.644
not only this, but all this  completely

00:31:23.705 --> 00:31:28.208
organizes, makes everything, carves everything.

00:31:28.279 --> 00:31:31.688
You are unaware that you are living under HER protection.

00:31:31.736 --> 00:31:37.219
That is why this unknown thing is to be revealed to you.

00:31:37.404 --> 00:31:41.440
and it has to be expressed because in this kaliyuga

00:31:41.641 --> 00:31:43.451
you are born in this doubtful state.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:47.004
But it is quite possible that you too might have been a

00:31:47.205 --> 00:31:50.669
great saint on the Himalayas, sitting shivering in cold.

00:31:51.172 --> 00:31:54.180
Don't know,  I cannot estimate your virtuousness

00:31:54.381 --> 00:31:58.036
because Sahajyuga is spreading so much that it seems

00:31:58.237 --> 00:32:01.506
all the virtuous people are taking birth in this world.

00:32:01.611 --> 00:32:06.491
You also test your virtuousness fully and get it

00:32:06.692 --> 00:32:08.982
which is a great thing.

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:12.630
Kundalini awakening, people say is very difficult

00:32:12.831 --> 00:32:14.972
May be for some people

00:32:15.173 --> 00:32:18.281
but neither for ME nor for Sahajyoga.

00:32:18.497 --> 00:32:19.497
It is very easy.

00:32:19.741 --> 00:32:22.527
It doesn't cause  any trouble nor any worry.

00:32:22.746 --> 00:32:25.542
This kundalini doesn't pass through seven chakras.

00:32:25.597 --> 00:32:26.597
It passes through six chakras.

00:32:26.627 --> 00:32:28.867
You should know it.

00:32:28.946 --> 00:32:32.076
In many of the books related to kundalini, I was so surprised that

00:32:32.341 --> 00:32:36.121
a German has written a book saying that Kundalini is in our belly.

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:39.489
some say Kundalini is in brain.

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:41.229
When you don't know about it

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:45.449
why do you talk about such a difficult topic?

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:49.879
How do you say abruptly, this thing is in this, that thing is in that

00:32:50.277 --> 00:32:53.233
the subject about which you don't have any knowledge,

00:32:53.257 --> 00:32:58.968
atleast scientifically you must humbly acquire knowledge

00:32:59.077 --> 00:33:01.629
and after that you must see

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:03.906
if it is beneficial for the whole humanity

00:33:03.923 --> 00:33:05.934
if it is higher than the whole society

00:33:06.135 --> 00:33:09.016
if it is giving rise to a new world

00:33:09.114 --> 00:33:12.905
then why do you put hurdles in that?

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.853
when there is no question of rupee, of no money

00:33:15.887 --> 00:33:18.153
nothing to take, nothing to give

00:33:18.237 --> 00:33:20.193
then why do you put hurdles on it?

00:33:20.312 --> 00:33:22.577
but where there is corruption

00:33:22.778 --> 00:33:26.087
here the people grab money at its peak and make everybody fool

00:33:26.163 --> 00:33:28.299
there nobody will say anything, everybody's mouth is shut.

00:33:28.674 --> 00:33:29.988
let someone stand up and  tell fearlessly

00:33:30.189 --> 00:33:32.618
this man has grabbed so much money by corruption

00:33:32.689 --> 00:33:35.717
gave so much money to MLA (s), to MT(s), nobody will say like that

00:33:36.006 --> 00:33:37.587
Here everybody's [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:37.871 --> 00:33:42.482
But I see that people make tales about  Sahajyoga.

00:33:42.584 --> 00:33:44.126
It has only one reason

00:33:44.327 --> 00:33:47.837
that those who are wicked people at our place

00:33:47.959 --> 00:33:50.389
don't want that any one should be benifitted in the world

00:33:50.544 --> 00:33:51.684
They want

00:33:51.885 --> 00:33:53.790
they want that the world should be such,

00:33:53.991 --> 00:33:58.123
they want the world to become so bad and with that our benifit

00:33:58.503 --> 00:34:01.442
but such people are very few.

00:34:01.515 --> 00:34:06.463
Mostly people are very beautiful, very nice but without any support.

00:34:06.721 --> 00:34:09.883
For such people it is necessary that they

00:34:10.084 --> 00:34:12.669
obtain their powers and be collective.

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:15.295
When they will be collective, then only

00:34:15.496 --> 00:34:17.921
these wicked trends will be destroyed from the world.

00:34:18.171 --> 00:34:21.572
And whatever are their after effects because of them

00:34:21.628 --> 00:34:24.382
whatever our problems are will come to an end.

00:34:24.476 --> 00:34:30.306
This will be in your social and political regions but

00:34:31.209 --> 00:34:33.951
there will be a great revolution inside ourselves

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:37.408
It is non controvertial that in sahajyoga people will get alright.

00:34:37.663 --> 00:34:39.057
There is no doubt about it.

00:34:39.258 --> 00:34:41.746
We can tell you that there are such people in Bombay

00:34:41.947 --> 00:34:44.813
who had blood cancer and now they are alright.

00:34:45.704 --> 00:34:47.503
and they are alright till now.

00:34:47.605 --> 00:34:50.616
Years have passed , they are alright and they will be so.

00:34:50.858 --> 00:34:54.719
But there is one thing, that if there is a rich man

00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:57.712
He will say, "No Mother you only have to treat me"

00:34:58.774 --> 00:35:02.428
Okay! once I may give him time, but I don't have so much of time.

00:35:03.255 --> 00:35:05.193
Then you will get cured of one disease

00:35:05.395 --> 00:35:06.881
Why can't another disease attack you?

00:35:07.648 --> 00:35:10.881
The reason is that completely in totality

00:35:10.949 --> 00:35:13.132
you have to get cured.

00:35:13.333 --> 00:35:16.227
For getting cured perfectly, what should you do?

00:35:16.481 --> 00:35:19.966
For that you should be totally in sahajyoga .

00:35:20.545 --> 00:35:23.631
Because there is depth in you, a lot of depth

00:35:23.709 --> 00:35:27.862
very sweetness, very beautiful, an ocean of joy

00:35:28.135 --> 00:35:30.982
but till you do not get it,

00:35:31.092 --> 00:35:33.234
till you do not take a dip into it,

00:35:33.435 --> 00:35:36.373
till then you will be attacked repeatedly.

00:35:36.473 --> 00:35:40.020
May be these are health related, or mental or intellectual or may be

00:35:42.564 --> 00:35:44.145
spiritual as well.

00:35:45.049 --> 00:35:48.332
To think about these things, a man must think

00:35:48.533 --> 00:35:51.221
that if we are getting realisation in Sahajyoga today

00:35:51.253 --> 00:35:53.124
and if we are getting this power

00:35:53.323 --> 00:35:58.677
it is very important that we use this power in such a way that

00:35:58.747 --> 00:36:02.188
we touch its depth, which is our property.

00:36:02.343 --> 00:36:06.014
That is special quality within us, let us distribute it.

00:36:06.151 --> 00:36:09.392
And for that it is such a great thing here that we

00:36:09.593 --> 00:36:12.702
in Mumbai have twenty five to thirty centers.

00:36:13.426 --> 00:36:15.276
And you go there and ask

00:36:15.477 --> 00:36:17.192
then whether you are very affulent

00:36:17.393 --> 00:36:20.155
or a great man or a man of low category, it doesn't matter.

00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:23.380
Because we are not doing any bussiness out of it

00:36:23.463 --> 00:36:27.127
We don't have luxurious palaces and things like that.

00:36:27.616 --> 00:36:32.153
We have all ordinary things and people can go and learn.

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:33.762
We should not think

00:36:33.963 --> 00:36:37.176
"I am king of some place, how can I come?"

00:36:37.765 --> 00:36:39.029
About this Mohammed Sahib has said

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:41.846
"He may be a king or a pauper, everybody has to sit on one level".

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:45.522
That is everybody is in front of God.

00:36:45.723 --> 00:36:48.584
After going there one who meditates

00:36:48.669 --> 00:36:50.454
and continue with his own depth

00:36:50.484 --> 00:36:53.597
and after that He won't have any problem.

00:36:53.964 --> 00:36:55.975
And he himself becomes powerful.

00:36:56.096 --> 00:36:58.360
There are some such people with us, you will be surprised

00:36:58.487 --> 00:37:01.326
very ordinary people who have average education

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.784
they have acquired such powers

00:37:05.072 --> 00:37:07.448
that they can cure every type of disease

00:37:07.649 --> 00:37:10.844
they can cure all types of mental diseases

00:37:11.011 --> 00:37:14.116
and not only this, they are very simple people

00:37:14.232 --> 00:37:16.118
and no KOWDI, no money, nothing

00:37:16.169 --> 00:37:18.700
if we have to go somewhere, recently we had to go to Calcutta

00:37:18.872 --> 00:37:20.437
there one person was treated.

00:37:21.134 --> 00:37:24.067
This way everyone can get this power.

00:37:24.424 --> 00:37:26.943
Not only this, you see your chidren are singing

00:37:27.061 --> 00:37:28.424
These are Indian children who are singing

00:37:28.625 --> 00:37:29.632
there is nothing special about it.

00:37:29.833 --> 00:37:33.252
And if you see, the song that was of Maha Laxmi

00:37:33.453 --> 00:37:34.988
is in Sanskrit language

00:37:35.073 --> 00:37:39.249
but it has been sung by Swiss Sahajyogis and they sing so nicely.

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:43.475
Those for whom to speak even a single word of Hindi

00:37:43.676 --> 00:37:44.758
would be a problem

00:37:44.959 --> 00:37:47.629
have sung this song so beautifully in Sanskrit.

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:51.668
They will sing in Marathi, in Hindi and our Indians also

00:37:51.868 --> 00:37:55.577
have done everything in English, French and German.

00:37:55.848 --> 00:37:57.928
This capability that human being has acquired

00:37:57.973 --> 00:37:59.773
and with this capability human beings

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:01.335
became a special human being

00:38:01.614 --> 00:38:04.773
One can say has reached the state of superman.

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:06.465
so sober

00:38:07.055 --> 00:38:14.695
so loving, so compassionate, so merciful and so much joy giving

00:38:14.847 --> 00:38:17.288
becomes such a large heart

00:38:17.891 --> 00:38:19.491
because it is a VISHWA DHARMA (universal religion).

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.919
All the religions are vested in it

00:38:22.295 --> 00:38:24.945
No religion is left behind from it, if it is a real religion

00:38:25.067 --> 00:38:26.359
All the religions are included in it

00:38:26.375 --> 00:38:27.651
what is its value?

00:38:27.737 --> 00:38:28.914
All of them are incarnations

00:38:29.008 --> 00:38:30.691
AAPPKE PRASHIT HAI..............

00:38:30.747 --> 00:38:34.903
Apart from that  all your saints and sages

00:38:34.944 --> 00:38:38.353
Where are they? what is their status? you have all that knowledge...

00:38:38.842 --> 00:38:43.850
The greatest thing is that it is your heritage.

00:38:44.797 --> 00:38:50.005
It is the heritage of your country, it is the heritage of India.

00:38:50.132 --> 00:38:53.373
It is your heritage. This heritage is yours.

00:38:53.655 --> 00:38:57.468
And you remained hidden from it, because Britishers ruled over you.

00:38:57.562 --> 00:39:00.256
and after that what happened, God save from that.

00:39:01.383 --> 00:39:03.755
I was with Gandhiji when I was seven years old

00:39:03.956 --> 00:39:06.393
Gandhiji was a self realised soul

00:39:06.831 --> 00:39:12.128
and He used to tell Me that when our country will be independent

00:39:12.236 --> 00:39:14.573
then you should start your Sahajyoga, not before that.

00:39:14.847 --> 00:39:18.205
I said ,"I have not known yet what a human being is.

00:39:18.406 --> 00:39:19.611
He has to go further.

00:39:19.812 --> 00:39:21.299
How can something be done?"

00:39:21.725 --> 00:39:25.942
He would say, till we do not become independent

00:39:26.175 --> 00:39:28.109
till then how can we know SAV KA TANTRA (self's mechanism )

00:39:28.287 --> 00:39:29.643
He said, that is absolutely right.

00:39:29.844 --> 00:39:33.816
Till we do not become independent, we cannot know SAV KA TANTRA

00:39:34.246 --> 00:39:37.542
But at that time, if Gandhiji had started it really

00:39:37.825 --> 00:39:41.170
Even now I think, if this self study had been started that time

00:39:41.371 --> 00:39:44.840
We would not have faced the plight , we are facing today.

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:48.212
The reason of our plight today is that

00:39:48.413 --> 00:39:50.940
we don't pay attention to ADHYATM (self study)

00:39:51.072 --> 00:39:52.915
Why doesn't it come to our mind?

00:39:52.958 --> 00:39:54.742
Although you may do anything

00:39:54.805 --> 00:40:00.071
Untill you get your ADHYATM, you cannot live peacefully.

00:40:01.405 --> 00:40:03.339
This is God's Divine bond.

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:10.780
You need money, take it. You need children, have it

00:40:11.161 --> 00:40:14.125
You want power, have power and get shoe beating from him.

00:40:14.797 --> 00:40:17.384
And you want anything VIP,

00:40:17.585 --> 00:40:21.454
get it and you will realise that there is no joy in it.

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:26.061
You know the law of Economics, that anything

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:31.232
you like and get it after hard work and after that

00:40:31.269 --> 00:40:32.942
after that the joy of getting it is over.

00:40:33.143 --> 00:40:35.524
After getting it, you want a new thing.

00:40:35.826 --> 00:40:39.239
It means that in general it is not satiable.

00:40:39.451 --> 00:40:44.420
A man's desires are never completely satiated.

00:40:45.238 --> 00:40:50.010
Same thing our desires within our being, which never get satiated

00:40:50.064 --> 00:40:53.460
So there is definitely some desire which will satiate us.

00:40:53.598 --> 00:40:57.031
And that desire is pure desire which we call Kundalini.

00:40:57.195 --> 00:40:59.300
We should acquire this kundalini

00:40:59.501 --> 00:41:02.418
From this we should know what we are.

00:41:03.297 --> 00:41:06.621
What is our speciality? Why are we in this world?

00:41:08.432 --> 00:41:11.834
Until our connection is with that Divine Power

00:41:12.044 --> 00:41:13.422
till then we cannot know.

00:41:13.623 --> 00:41:16.762
[INAUDIBLE] or we are in our ego

00:41:16.963 --> 00:41:20.164
we cannot know  properly what is the real problem.

00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:24.069
Grand, dignified person

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.335
today we need such a person

00:41:26.461 --> 00:41:28.215
who is great

00:41:28.471 --> 00:41:33.398
and the one who has within him his self respect.

00:41:33.532 --> 00:41:35.112
that in comparison to that self respect

00:41:35.313 --> 00:41:37.040
considers filthy  things filthy.

00:41:37.378 --> 00:41:41.343
But this religion awakening should be from within not externally.

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:43.736
When a man gets awakened in this religion

00:41:43.815 --> 00:41:46.123
then he gives up all the ADHARMAS (unrightuous).

00:41:46.324 --> 00:41:47.735
These  are left out on their own.

00:41:48.145 --> 00:41:49.799
As I gave you the example

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.640
these saints didn't need any one to tell them

00:41:52.668 --> 00:41:54.346
They were DHARMIC by birth.

00:41:54.799 --> 00:41:57.011
This DHARMA should awaken within you

00:41:57.055 --> 00:41:58.790
and for that there should be kundalini awakening.

00:41:58.991 --> 00:42:02.028
I cannot show you where DHARMA is in front of so many people but

00:42:02.229 --> 00:42:04.891
where you can see a big green circle, there is your DHARMA.

00:42:05.092 --> 00:42:07.832
We will awaken that DHARMA

00:42:09.089 --> 00:42:13.131
then even if we desire we cannot do ADHARMA.

00:42:13.706 --> 00:42:16.136
Even if we want , we cannot do wrong things

00:42:16.345 --> 00:42:18.389
because, the moment we do something wrong

00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:20.676
this chaitanya will depart from us and we will be away from joy.

00:42:20.877 --> 00:42:23.099
so, leave it, we have nothing to do with it.

00:42:23.315 --> 00:42:29.042
This is not for a group not for one  country

00:42:29.487 --> 00:42:34.599
not for any particular type of people, it is for the whole world.

00:42:35.462 --> 00:42:37.608
and the whole world has to get it.

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:40.133
There have been many prophesies about it

00:42:40.264 --> 00:42:43.626
and people have said that it is going to happen.

00:42:43.909 --> 00:42:48.232
But towards this, you should think a little bit that

00:42:48.245 --> 00:42:51.131
i too am a seeker

00:42:51.505 --> 00:42:53.750
and it is necessary for a seeker

00:42:53.844 --> 00:42:58.294
that he thinks that whatever he will get, that he will know

00:42:58.307 --> 00:42:59.657
and i will go deep into it.

00:42:59.787 --> 00:43:01.817
Many people get realisation in Sahajyoga.

00:43:02.018 --> 00:43:03.721
Today also you see many people may get realisation

00:43:03.778 --> 00:43:05.885
but there are very few people who go deep into it.

00:43:06.107 --> 00:43:08.290
and this is what troubles ME.

00:43:08.362 --> 00:43:09.913
Here there are not deep people.

00:43:10.077 --> 00:43:12.472
It is just the reverse topic in the universe

00:43:12.493 --> 00:43:14.911
Here people once get realisation, get settled into it.

00:43:15.673 --> 00:43:19.043
Out of them, barely one or two will be useless

00:43:19.446 --> 00:43:21.682
but in our country the reason is that

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:29.010
we have so many ideals, such great incarnations have been here

00:43:29.033 --> 00:43:30.568
we don't respect ourselves.

00:43:30.769 --> 00:43:34.058
We have one Guru, he is Guru Maharaj we consider him as our Guru.

00:43:34.092 --> 00:43:36.001
What about you?

00:43:36.031 --> 00:43:37.467
What gravity you have acquired?

00:43:37.515 --> 00:43:40.996
We adore Rama, we adore Hanumana, we adore Mohammad.

00:43:41.113 --> 00:43:43.932
But have you been benefitted by that?

00:43:44.063 --> 00:43:45.117
Why do you accept THEM?

00:43:45.179 --> 00:43:47.206
Your yourself become worthy of admiration.

00:43:47.347 --> 00:43:52.049
And this is possible when their qualities will awaken within you.

00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:55.408
Sahajyoga awakens that very quality in them.

00:43:56.192 --> 00:44:00.109
That is why I want to tell you only one thing,

00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:02.409
that there should be truthfulness in it.

00:44:03.263 --> 00:44:05.742
and if you ask for it humbly

00:44:05.914 --> 00:44:07.652
you will get it surely.

00:44:08.163 --> 00:44:10.046
You can get it surely.

00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:14.723
So, in MY opinion tomorrow I will tell you specially about it.

00:44:14.862 --> 00:44:19.290
because, you will get books about kundalini, you should read.

00:44:19.486 --> 00:44:22.763
I only want that your inner light may enlighten.

00:44:23.469 --> 00:44:26.961
After that, what is this Atma? I will tell you about that tomorrow.

00:44:27.759 --> 00:44:30.419
I hope that from today you will understand

00:44:30.526 --> 00:44:32.977
You are not what you think of yourself.

00:44:33.178 --> 00:44:35.015
You are much greater than that

00:44:35.032 --> 00:44:38.301
and you don't have to get it, you have only to know it.

00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:40.767
MY blessings to you!

00:44:45.265 --> 00:44:48.643
Those who have to out for five to ten minutes

00:44:48.852 --> 00:44:49.852
they may go and come back.

00:44:50.122 --> 00:44:54.130
It will take ten minutes for your self realisation..........

00:44:54.368 --> 00:44:57.801
and so much for this Mother Earth and now

00:44:58.307 --> 00:45:00.069
for your ownself and for others.

00:45:00.281 --> 00:45:04.296
Tell them, those who want to go out can go for five to ten minutes

00:45:04.497 --> 00:45:05.994
and then sit comfortably.

00:45:18.266 --> 00:45:24.372
As we must have respect of ourselves, because we are human beings.

00:45:25.115 --> 00:45:28.524
Here in lies the epitomy of evolution.

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:41.587
All should have one's self-respect and that we

00:45:42.478 --> 00:45:47.807
are born as human beings and human being is on top of evolution

00:45:48.521 --> 00:45:50.704
and for himself, Human being

00:45:52.185 --> 00:45:55.618
should never underestimate himself, that is the first condition

00:45:57.033 --> 00:46:00.427
This is the first condition that you have to respect yourself.

00:46:03.454 --> 00:46:05.180
you must have complete self confidence about yourself.

00:46:10.708 --> 00:46:15.722
We should have complete self confidence about ourselves

00:46:18.281 --> 00:46:19.675
and we should know

00:46:20.452 --> 00:46:22.320
That those who tell us

00:46:22.521 --> 00:46:26.431
that you have done this sin and that sin, they speak like that

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:29.325
all these people

00:46:29.362 --> 00:46:32.772
are themselves sinners.

00:46:33.669 --> 00:46:36.290
Because you are human beings and every human being

00:46:37.751 --> 00:46:41.146
can make some or the other mistake. He is not a God.

00:46:42.157 --> 00:46:45.025
So, towards oneself, in a way

00:46:45.226 --> 00:46:48.844
there should be respect and self respect.

00:46:50.691 --> 00:46:54.889
This is the first condition for you.

00:46:58.981 --> 00:47:01.523
After all you are not God.

00:47:02.066 --> 00:47:04.468
You can make mistakes, doesn't matter.

00:47:04.666 --> 00:47:06.654
Those who tell you that you are sinners

00:47:07.031 --> 00:47:08.814
Please remember, they must be the greatest sinners.

00:47:09.449 --> 00:47:13.348
Nobody has bussiness to say like that to any human being.

00:47:14.484 --> 00:47:18.740
So all of you should have complete regard and respect for your being.

00:47:19.678 --> 00:47:20.678
I have no fear.

00:47:24.033 --> 00:47:26.911
And one should never under-estimate himself

00:47:27.905 --> 00:47:30.910
I am like this, I am like that

00:47:31.111 --> 00:47:32.693
we have always heard that

00:47:33.535 --> 00:47:36.548
and those who tell that are them selves sinners that we should know

00:47:36.749 --> 00:47:39.973
and for oneself never have feeling of inferiority

00:47:40.209 --> 00:47:44.235
if you were God it would be a different thing

00:47:44.436 --> 00:47:47.456
but you are human beings.

00:47:47.657 --> 00:47:53.092
And human beings will make some or the other mistakes.

00:47:53.447 --> 00:47:57.671
And so I request not to have any low feelings.

00:47:57.929 --> 00:48:01.276
This is my sincere request to you

00:48:02.853 --> 00:48:06.216
And that now you have to enter into in the kingdom of God.

00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:08.583
Be Joyful about yourself.

00:48:10.251 --> 00:48:11.251
You should be very

00:48:14.084 --> 00:48:15.398
happy about yourself

00:48:16.008 --> 00:48:17.772
very much pleased about yourself.

00:48:21.774 --> 00:48:25.090
You sit in a very pleased state within yourself.

00:48:26.482 --> 00:48:29.504
There is no need to degrade yourself down.

00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:33.926
And second condition is

00:48:34.455 --> 00:48:36.920
that you forgive everyone

00:48:36.987 --> 00:48:38.913
you

00:48:39.354 --> 00:48:42.583
forgive everyone. You do not do anything

00:48:42.669 --> 00:48:46.670
But if you do not forgive then

00:48:47.696 --> 00:48:51.914
you are playing in the hands of those who will hurt you

00:48:53.239 --> 00:48:55.776
[Marathi]

00:48:55.977 --> 00:48:59.809
so I request you to forgive everyone altogether.

00:49:00.374 --> 00:49:03.053
and don't think, to forgive someone and not to forgive others

00:49:03.609 --> 00:49:05.381
Forgive all of them

00:49:11.233 --> 00:49:12.233
With that

00:49:14.569 --> 00:49:20.765
one thing is that you have to forgive everyone together.

00:49:21.369 --> 00:49:23.866
You may forgive or may not,

00:49:24.738 --> 00:49:27.281
but you don't do anything.

00:49:27.875 --> 00:49:29.113
It is all false

00:49:29.314 --> 00:49:31.508
and once you

00:49:31.603 --> 00:49:33.302
don't forgive anyone,

00:49:33.586 --> 00:49:37.663
then you play into the hands of those who want to tease you.

00:49:37.897 --> 00:49:41.163
So, altogether, without remembering whom you have to forgive

00:49:41.364 --> 00:49:42.878
say together in your heart

00:49:43.079 --> 00:49:45.332
I forgive completely.

00:49:46.965 --> 00:49:51.797
Thes second condition is to completely forgive

00:49:51.884 --> 00:49:55.548
everyone altogether not to the member

00:49:55.718 --> 00:49:58.136
individually in person but

00:49:58.369 --> 00:50:00.837
in a general way just forgive.

00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:05.097
Whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything.

00:50:05.649 --> 00:50:09.859
But if you do not forgive then you play into wrong hands.

00:50:10.288 --> 00:50:14.711
So it is a myth, and so please don't torture yourself with the myth.

00:50:15.016 --> 00:50:17.589
Please forgive everyone

00:50:17.775 --> 00:50:20.107
without thinking individually about anyone.

00:50:20.235 --> 00:50:22.989
In a general way, just say , i forgive everyone.

00:50:24.239 --> 00:50:25.940
These are the two conditions.

00:50:34.682 --> 00:50:36.418
Take out your shoes.

00:50:38.293 --> 00:50:39.293
Please take out your shoes.

00:50:40.214 --> 00:50:43.510
remove your shoes on one side

00:50:43.917 --> 00:50:45.424
and those who are sitting on ground

00:50:48.567 --> 00:50:49.567
not for them

00:50:53.409 --> 00:50:55.416
[Marathi]

00:50:56.121 --> 00:50:57.965
[Marathi]

00:51:00.862 --> 00:51:03.767
[Marathi]

00:51:05.079 --> 00:51:07.930
[Marathi]

00:51:08.413 --> 00:51:12.082
[Marathi]

00:51:12.113 --> 00:51:14.105
[Marathi]

00:51:15.059 --> 00:51:17.050
[Marathi]

00:51:17.246 --> 00:51:19.884
Please keep your feet apart from each other.

00:51:19.963 --> 00:51:23.195
Those who are sitting on the chair, can remove their shoes.

00:51:24.381 --> 00:51:29.080
Those who are sitting on the chair, keep their feet apart

00:51:29.174 --> 00:51:30.677
and remove their shoes.

00:51:45.146 --> 00:51:46.678
Now put your both the hands

00:51:47.496 --> 00:51:49.906
like this. Take out your shoes.

00:51:50.155 --> 00:51:51.155
[Marathi]

00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:54.807
[Marathi]

00:52:01.384 --> 00:52:02.711
Both the hands towards ME.

00:52:20.608 --> 00:52:21.608
[Marathi]

00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:23.920
[Marathi]

00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:25.710
[Marathi]

00:52:25.992 --> 00:52:28.465
[Marathi]

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:30.888
Please put your left hand towards ME

00:52:31.089 --> 00:52:32.979
and right hand towards the Mother Earth

00:52:33.306 --> 00:52:37.026

Keep left hand towards ME and right hand on Mother Earth.

00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:46.905
or towards Mother Earth if you are sitting in a chair.

00:53:02.305 --> 00:53:04.996
Now right hand towards ME.

00:53:05.089 --> 00:53:07.176
Put right hand towards ME

00:53:08.075 --> 00:53:10.001
and the left hand towards the sky.

00:53:12.874 --> 00:53:15.081
Tomorrow I will tell you why I did so.

00:53:15.185 --> 00:53:19.295
[Marathi]

00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:22.282
[Marathi]

00:53:23.379 --> 00:53:24.379
[Marathi]

00:53:27.034 --> 00:53:28.034
[Marathi]

00:53:36.024 --> 00:53:39.265
[Marathi]

00:53:42.855 --> 00:53:50.390
why?

00:53:59.139 --> 00:54:03.371
[Marathi]

00:54:04.532 --> 00:54:07.950
Put both the hands towards the sky.

00:54:07.988 --> 00:54:09.648
[Marathi]

00:54:09.849 --> 00:54:13.080
Push back your head

00:54:13.214 --> 00:54:14.214
[Marathi]

00:54:14.582 --> 00:54:17.078
[Marathi]

00:54:18.979 --> 00:54:22.425
Now, just ask a question

00:54:25.816 --> 00:54:28.972
Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

00:54:29.622 --> 00:54:30.883
Or ask the question,

00:54:31.084 --> 00:54:35.945
Mother,"Is this the cool breeze of the all pervading power of God?"

00:54:37.377 --> 00:54:39.475
Put a question, is this

00:54:40.837 --> 00:54:44.476

00:54:56.077 --> 00:54:57.077
Ask in your heart.

00:54:58.552 --> 00:55:01.303
Ask three times, three times

00:55:07.585 --> 00:55:08.838
[Marathi]

00:55:12.188 --> 00:55:14.393
[Marathi]

00:55:15.026 --> 00:55:18.271
The trees are not moving, they are just still.

00:55:18.416 --> 00:55:20.634
but you feel the cool breeze in your hands.

00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:29.114
and watch Me without thinking.

00:55:29.836 --> 00:55:31.836

00:55:32.356 --> 00:55:33.356
[Marathi]

00:55:34.248 --> 00:55:36.758
The trees are not moving, the leaves are not moving.

00:55:37.164 --> 00:55:39.277
means coolness will be in your hands.

00:55:44.207 --> 00:55:46.360
Now put your right hand towards ME.

00:55:46.423 --> 00:55:49.583

and bend your head

00:55:56.529 --> 00:55:58.992
and see for yourself from the fontenal bone area

00:55:59.193 --> 00:56:01.767
if you are getting cool breeze from the other side.

00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:04.686
[Marathi]

00:56:06.314 --> 00:56:09.417
Don't put your hand on the top of your head, away from it.

00:56:09.681 --> 00:56:11.351
[Marathi]

00:56:11.828 --> 00:56:15.069

00:56:15.151 --> 00:56:17.959

00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:19.922
some people take it much further

00:56:20.909 --> 00:56:23.126
some people feel at a higher level

00:56:23.517 --> 00:56:25.019
and some very close

00:56:29.290 --> 00:56:32.567
put the left hand towards ME.

00:56:33.949 --> 00:56:36.499
Don't doubt. Don't doubt yourself.

00:56:38.007 --> 00:56:39.932
Now put down your head again.

00:56:40.076 --> 00:56:41.830
and see with your right hand.

00:56:42.058 --> 00:56:44.480
There is a cool breeze on the top of your head.

00:56:52.423 --> 00:56:56.174
Now see, cool breeze will come from your  Fontanelle bone.

00:56:57.112 --> 00:56:59.786
[Marathi]

00:57:00.112 --> 00:57:02.853

00:57:06.923 --> 00:57:09.625
[Marathi]

00:57:09.702 --> 00:57:11.524
Some people might feel hot.

00:57:11.725 --> 00:57:14.542
Heat coming out.

00:57:14.765 --> 00:57:16.933

00:57:33.462 --> 00:57:35.222
Keep your hand away

Again please bend your head and watch

00:57:38.751 --> 00:57:42.177
that cool breeze must be coming from your  Fontanelle bone.

00:57:44.213 --> 00:57:46.461
left hand on the head and right hand towards ME.

00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:49.640
............

00:57:51.311 --> 00:57:52.311
ok

00:57:54.133 --> 00:57:55.628
Now put your both the hands like this

00:57:56.650 --> 00:57:58.242
You have become too much thoughtless

00:57:58.874 --> 00:57:59.540
no thoughts

00:58:01.712 --> 00:58:02.712
Nirvichar

00:58:10.264 --> 00:58:12.478
Those in whose hands

00:58:12.679 --> 00:58:15.687
now you see, not even a single tree is moving

00:58:16.206 --> 00:58:17.338
not even a single leaf is moving

00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:19.456
everything you are seeing yourself, nothing such

00:58:19.798 --> 00:58:22.674
You are seeing yourself, you are witness to it

00:58:22.824 --> 00:58:26.179
Not a single leaf is moving, they are all witnessing you

00:58:26.490 --> 00:58:29.391
All these trees are witnessing, what is happening to you.

00:58:32.762 --> 00:58:35.561
Only this has been a great country.

00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:36.990
Now

00:58:37.716 --> 00:58:41.087
Those who have felt cool breeze in their hands

00:58:41.736 --> 00:58:44.982
Those who have felt cool breeze in their hands

00:58:48.753 --> 00:58:51.202
Those who felt cool breeze

00:58:52.051 --> 00:58:56.179
or they have felt it through their Fontanelle bone area

00:58:57.968 --> 00:59:00.846
Those who felt cool breeze on their Fontanelle bone area

00:59:01.885 --> 00:59:04.377
Those who felt cool breeze on their Fontanelle bone area

00:59:09.477 --> 00:59:11.890
All those who felt

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:15.445
put their both the hands like this

00:59:15.497 --> 00:59:18.489
please raise your both the hands, those who have felt it.

00:59:30.287 --> 00:59:32.306
All of you are now saints

00:59:32.964 --> 00:59:34.754
My blessings to you!

00:59:36.724 --> 00:59:40.000
Now you respect your Atma Sakhshatkar.

00:59:40.231 --> 00:59:42.311
You must respect your self realisation.

00:59:42.901 --> 00:59:45.178
What you have got , what you have felt

00:59:46.096 --> 00:59:47.873
and what you have enjoyed

00:59:49.126 --> 00:59:52.138
you must know what is this power and how to use it.

00:59:52.612 --> 00:59:53.612
How to work it out?

00:59:54.348 --> 00:59:57.007
And now you have become authority with this power.

00:59:58.180 --> 01:00:03.612
So please, remember that now you have to move

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:06.670
deeper and deeper into your own being.

01:00:07.258 --> 01:00:08.918
Whatever you are now,

01:00:09.818 --> 01:00:12.782
I won't say that you have now become Sahaj yogis

01:00:13.172 --> 01:00:17.494
yes, your kundalini has been awakened.

01:00:17.610 --> 01:00:19.001
There is no doubt about it

01:00:19.330 --> 01:00:21.599
but only after going completely to the depth of it

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:23.581
you can become a Sahaj yogi.

01:00:23.991 --> 01:00:26.105
It should be decided  a bit

01:00:26.306 --> 01:00:29.784
that you go into your depth and get it.

01:00:30.525 --> 01:00:35.778
That is your power, your property and is your dignity.

01:00:35.979 --> 01:00:37.719
It is a matter of great pleasure

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:40.903
that all of you have got your realisation.

01:00:41.762 --> 01:00:43.269
It is a matter of great pleasure that

01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:44.738
all of you have got realisation.

01:00:45.268 --> 01:00:47.904
Self realisation has begun for everyone.

01:00:48.384 --> 01:00:50.062
But unless and until you

01:00:50.595 --> 01:00:52.791
go deeper

01:00:53.587 --> 01:00:54.587
till then

01:00:56.469 --> 01:00:58.996
You cannot be called a Sahajyogi.

01:00:59.246 --> 01:01:01.460
And till you are not gone deeper, there will

01:01:01.661 --> 01:01:03.625
be always some kind of problem lingering on.

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:08.811
Please go to our centers and go deeper.

01:01:09.225 --> 01:01:10.458
Tomorrow again

01:01:10.849 --> 01:01:14.303
I am available at your service and

01:01:15.733 --> 01:01:17.737
tomorrow I will talk about Spirit.

01:01:18.253 --> 01:01:20.940
So tomorrow everyone please be present here.

01:01:21.347 --> 01:01:25.443
and share with everyone, that it is a very simple thing.

01:01:25.662 --> 01:01:27.621
Within five minutes i got my self realisation.

01:01:27.793 --> 01:01:30.396
They won't believe it. Ask them to come and see it.

01:01:30.527 --> 01:01:34.527
Now you will be able to sleep very well.

01:01:37.505 --> 01:01:40.059
And everything has worked out very well very well.

01:01:40.355 --> 01:01:42.567
You have to experience

01:01:43.106 --> 01:01:45.101
Now the benefit of it

01:01:45.387 --> 01:01:47.898
only by using this power

01:01:48.010 --> 01:01:51.841
and  also by going deeper into your routine

01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:56.684
you become really, absolutely an authority of Sahajyoga.

01:01:57.263 --> 01:01:58.770
I wish you all good luck!
