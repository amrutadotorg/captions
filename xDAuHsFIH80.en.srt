Hello, hello

155
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:52,420
Good evening ladies and gentlemen. I want to welcome you here on behalf of sahaja yoga, in Victoria

156
00:18:53,100 --> 00:19:00,600
and in particular to draw to your attention to the fact that we have now in our midst

157
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:08,480
a very great personality, whose affect on hundreds and thousands of people round the world has been

158
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,720
quite dynamic and in many respects, unbelievable.

159
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:20,520
Now the Russians have flooded into sahaja yoga,

160
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:26,860
the Europeans in 64 countries is operative,

161
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,540
it's a very, very big undertaking in India

162
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:37,400
and it's on these occasions that one realizes the immense importance of

163
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,460
uh.. the individual life and the collective life

164
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,860
and how these are now coming together in a very, very positive way.

165
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:54,820
When our friend Steven here was talking to you about the nature of the inner

166
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:00,940
quality of dynamic, which we call the Kundalini and the chakra system

167
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:06,380
that we're looking at something which has been embedded in human-beings

168
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:13,000
and has been awakened through the great historical periods by dynamic and

169
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:21,020
uh.. highly spiritual avatars. Each of these chakras represents a stage in human development

170
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:29,100
and they're all there in every human-being. Not only that the power of the Kundalini

171
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:37,040
is so uh..as we are aware, spread throughout the whole of the human race and it's importance is so great

172
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:43,040
that when one sits awake and all those distinctions of race, of class,

173
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:51,300
of wealth, of poverty, of importance in society, are illuminated

174
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,760
and the human-being can, for the first time,

175
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:03,520
uh.. actually move into the consciouness of what the real self is, not the self which sits on the surface,

176
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,280
the self which belongs to the ego

177
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:12,240
and the emotions, but the real self which is hidden deeply in the unconscious

178
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,100
and these two things are dynamic of that Kundalini awakening

179
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:23,700
and the entry into consciousness of the operations of the real self

180
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:29,060
which, in fact, is linked with all other human-beings and all life,

181
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:35,920
is one of the great opportunities offered in this great critical time at the end of the twentieth century.

182
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:42,100
Now this history, if you like, of the

183
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:49,320
human-being in our civilization has been one from this operation

184
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:54,640
as it were of the left side to the dynamic of the right side.

185
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:01,400
The left side with it's emotion is particular quality of civilization is taken quite a number of centuries.

186
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:07,340
If you look at human-beings in our Western world today, they're functioning with this ego,

187
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:15,480
the personal consciousness and the dynamic of the right side or if we use the Sanskrit term, the Rajoguna,

188
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:22,520
dynamic and externally oriented. And when one takes one's attention away

189
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:28,440
as it were with [UNCLEAR - ROSETTE] from that externality, one has the chance

190
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,320
in meditation to reach the real center.

191
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:38,800
If you look at the history of civilization, you'll find that it's either the left or the right side,

192
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,500
through great periods of time, that's been dominated in the way people act and behave.

193
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:49,140
In our centuries, the acuteness of the ego is so great

194
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:55,620
that the ego now feels itself totally cut off from life, from other human-beings

195
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:02,640
and from the whole web of existence. And the ecological problems which exist in our external world

196
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:08,860
and in nature are brought by the industrial society and expression of the fragmentation

197
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:13,340
which is going on within the human-being uh.. internally.

198
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:19,620
Now sahaja yoga offers that wonderful opportunity of bringing

199
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,800
consciousness back into the center. We have never really tried

200
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:30,500
as a civilization, to operate in the dynamic reascending mode

201
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:38,200
which is this pathway here. And the purpose of the Kundalini is to pass through and awaken and cleanse

202
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:43,760
each of the chakras within this system and ultimately to provide

203
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:49,980
the total experience of what the self really is and that self is collective.

204
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:55,700
It's not something which we can call uh the individual 'I' anymore, it's something which is

205
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:02,800
deeply embedded in the whole totality of existence. Now, Shri Mataji is a remarkable figure,

206
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:09,600
who in hundreds and thousands of instances has brought this realization

207
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,220
to people all over the world. It is no longer an individual thing

208
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:22,700
for a few people with a guru. It is now something to be experienced within the consciousness

209
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:29,520
of modern man in vast numbers. In fact, the very

210
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:37,280
uh.. existence of large numbers of people enhances the experience of this collective realization principle.

211
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:43,240
So, I have the greatest pleasure in introducing this figure

212
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:51,200
of world importance in, in the field of yoga - Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. [CLAPPING]

213
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,660
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

214
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:19,200
At the very outset we have to know, that truth is what it is.

215
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,260
We cannot change it, we cannot transform it

216
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:34,020
and unfortunately, at the level of human awareness, we cannot know it.

217
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:40,400
The reason is, as they have explained to you already,

218
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:48,060
that these two things called conditionings and the ego, are covering our brain.

219
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:56,060
Apart from that, we are not connected to the All-Pervading

220
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:00,760
power, which is the love of God.

221
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:07,260
In these modern times to talk of God, is something out of trade

222
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:12,920
and also there are many people who have talked about God,

223
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,900
established religions, established all kinds of huge, big organizations

224
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,260
and people have discovered that there's no truth in it.

225
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:31,640
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

226
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:44,460
At the very outset we have to know, that truth is what it is.

227
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:51,620
We cannot change it, we cannot transform it

228
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:59,000
and unfortunately, at the level of human awareness, we cannot know it.

229
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,320
The reason is, as they have explained to you already,

230
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:10,180
these two things called conditionings and the ego

231
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:15,720
are covering our brain. Apart from that

232
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,940
we are not connected to the All-Pervading power, which is

233
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:32,280
the love God. In these modern times, to talk of God is something out of trade.

234
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:37,920
and also there are many people who have talked about God

235
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:44,140
established religions, established all kinds of huge, big organizations

236
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,120
and people have discovered that there's no truth in it.

237
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:56,320
It's not based on truth though the Incarnations, prophets

238
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:04,460
all of them have been expressing nothing but truth, manifesting nothing but truth.

239
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:11,260
But somehow or other, all these organizations have deviated and what is the reason for that?

240
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:17,760
The reason for that is simple thing which was important,

241
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:24,560
is that one has to go beyond this human awareness

242
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:31,500
through their Self-realization, through their second birth or as Walihood, as they call it in Islam.

243
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:38,160
This was not at all attempted, nor the attention paid

244
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,480
to such an important thing, that we have to

245
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,640
get our Self-realization, that we have to be connected to this All-Pervading power of God.

246
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:56,540
That's why they deviated into, I think, two three things, firstly it deviated into many orientation.

247
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,700
It became the thing where people must make money.

248
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:09,000
And such horrible things they have done, it's surprising how could they do it, when they were professing truth.

249
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:18,540
The second was that they wanted to have power - they did for power so they mixed up politics, this that - such a mixture of things.

250
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:26,460
But they are not spirit oriented - they didn't work out that you have to be the spirit.

251
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:33,680
Now this mechanism exists within you, I say so, but you shouldn't take it for granted,

252
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:41,000
you shouldn't believe Me blindly but you must experience yourself, if it is so.

253
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:49,260
Like a hypothesis you can accept what I am saying but supposing I prove it, then you have to accept it as honest people.

254
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:56,140
Because it is for your benevolence, is the benevolence of this Australia, benevolence of the whole world.

255
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:02,380
This is what we have been waiting for all these days, this is being promised to us in all the scriptures.

256
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:09,620
But instead of seeking that, people have deviated into businesses or into political organizations

257
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:19,220
which is a very unjust, unfair treatment to Divinity.

258
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,680
This Divinity resides within you all, as shown here, is within you.

259
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,600
This power is within you, is your own power.

260
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:39,520
Maybe, I just trigger it like one enlightened light can enlighten another light

261
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:45,340
but is within you, residing just like a primule in a seed.

262
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:52,580
And whatever powers you get afterwards, when you are connected to the mains, are also within you.

263
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:59,900
You are not to feel obliged to Me nor am I in any way obligated to you.

264
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:04,340
It's just that it is your own,

265
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:09,640
this is your own property and that the key has to be found.

266
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:17,200
Of course you can't pay for it - one must understand you can't pay for a higher awareness.

267
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:22,780
What can you pay? It's something so natural - it's a living process

268
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:28,080
and what do we pay to this Mother Earth for sprouting a seed - She doesn't understand even.

269
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:35,340
So you can't pay for it - first of all understand that it is not something material that you can buy

270
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,040
but it's your own energy which has to manifest it.

271
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:47,160
Tomorrow, of course, I'm going to tell you about what is the nature of the spirit

272
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:55,600
but today I've just to tell you one thing that this Kundalini is within you

273
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:03,940
and when She rises, she definitely solves your physical, mental, emotional problems,

274
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:11,440
also your material problems but above all your spiritual urge.

275
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,400
They say that, in this

276
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:21,700
Kaliyuga, ghor Kaliyuga - these modern times - this

277
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:28,160
work will be done - is already been predicted

278
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:35,660
that people who were seeking the truth in the hills and dales

279
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:41,720
will find it within themselves, as ordinary householders.

280
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,860
And that's what I find, is so easy. The time is such

281
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:51,880
that it is working out in such great numbers.

282
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:59,660
Surprisingly, in a place, which we call the country called Russia

283
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:08,080
where they had never heard about God, they were not supposed to think about God, they were not supposed to even utter the word God

284
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:15,820
where thousands and thousands have got realization and such seeking.

285
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:23,440
I was wondering, what is the thing that they have that they should in thousands should come to these

286
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:29,640
lectures of Mine and I had to arrange them in stadiums - never in a hall like this.

287
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:36,160
And the way they got their realization is very surprising - how they got it.

288
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,340
Because they said, "Mother, we have nothing to do with spirituality,

289
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:48,580
we never heard there is something higher than this human awareness and how do we get this."

290
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:59,660
I said, 'There must be something special about you.' And the special about them, I think, that they were kept out of materialism.

291
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,560
They have everything provided for, whatever is necessary.

292
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:11,320
Moreover, they are very introspective by nature, extremely introspective. If you read their

293
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:17,520
writers like Tolstoy or anyone, even the hero will introspect himself.

294
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:24,600
This introspection has brought forth such personalities that they are finding,

295
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:29,700
one thing in common, that they haven't found out the Absolute Truth.

296
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:35,880
Whatever they know is on the relative terminology - even the Science.

297
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:41,560
Science, they think, is all the time changing, is nothing of a permanent nature.

298
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:48,840
And when I address there, the Scientists, they said, "Mother, tell us everything else but not Science - we had enough of it."

299
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:55,780
So this is what it is, that we have to see also what all these enterprises we have entered into.

300
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:04,580
Like Science, what has happened to us. Today we have created a big devil there, atom bomb and here a Hydrogen bomb sitting on our head.

301
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:11,180
We have created those devils and they are frightening us. We have created these ecological problems.

302
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:15,260
We have created this political problems, economical problems ourselves.

303
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,660
That means, something wrong with human-beings, that means, they haven't found the Absolute.

304
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,860
So, this human-being has to be transformed.

305
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:32,340
This transformation once takes place, you become the Spirit.

306
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:39,980
It's question of becoming, it's not just giving a sermon or a lecture or anything like that - it's, it should happen to you.

307
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:47,400
From this human awareness you have to become a higher personality, which is a spiritual awareness.

308
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:56,380
This can happen very easily. Sahaja means also very easy, simple - also it means born with you.

309
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:03,500
So you all have a birthright, you're born with this birthright, to get your Self-realization.

310
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:12,340
For that, you do not have to pay, do not have to exert, it's, it's absolutely effortless

311
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:18,400
and also you do not have to think about it because it is beyond thinking.

312
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:26,660
So many things people are talking about, so many theories -

313
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,720
they talk of Capitalism, Communism, this ism, that isms,

314
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,840
goes on like a yarn out of the brain comes out and everybody gets engulfed.

315
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,680
Once it is written down, it becomes a Bible - people start following it but of no avail.

316
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:51,220
Only compartments have been created - you are this, you're that, you're a Christian, Hindu, Muslim, this, that and all that - into compartments.

317
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:59,220
Human-beings are divided by all this thinking - you are a Communist, you are a Capitalist, you're this, you're that - you're not.

318
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:07,580
You are a human-being to begin with and you're the pure Spirit. And if the Spirit

319
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:15,420
is the reflection of one God, then how can we be separated, how can we put into some compartments.

320
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:20,800
We are part and parcel of one God Almighty.

321
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:27,340
The microcosm has to become the macrocosm, that's all. This happening has to take place

322
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:32,380
where the drop of your personality has to become one with the whole.

323
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:39,580
Also the concept of individuality is so wrong. This concept of individuality that we have

324
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:48,280
is against the Spirit of the whole, absolutely against the Spirit of the whole but individuality,

325
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:56,800
I mean, the way nature is individual in the sense every leaf is different from another leaf, every flower is different from another flower, to look at,

326
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:06,220
but in it's nature it is just the same - it comes from the same source.

327
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:12,180
In the same way, we have to become the Spirit though we may dress up separately,

328
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:19,820
differently - I mean, in sahaja yoga nobody is wearing funny dresses, you see, like regimentation or some sort of a uh..

329
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:26,740
orange dress or nothing of the kind. It's not the dress that matters, it's something very much inside and innate.

330
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,800
So the innate religion has to be awakened. Unless and until that innate religion is awakened -

331
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:39,400
you may be a Christian, Hindu, Muslim, anything - you can commit any kind of sin,

332
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:46,320
any kind of murder, any theft, anything that is all absolutely against the collective.

333
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:54,380
Nothing stops you. That means whatever you're professing, is just outside, is just mental nothing has gone inside.

334
00:38:55,580 --> 00:39:02,420
Even if you are educated in that. You have seen the priest, you have seen the mullahs, you have seen all these people - they are so well educated -

335
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,020
they do the same thing. What's wrong there?

336
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,580
When they know this is right, why don't they do what is right?

337
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:16,420
The reason is, they haven't got the power of the Spirit.

338
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:22,780
In the light of the Spirit only, you become what you profess.

339
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:32,120
You walk what you talk. We don't have to tell anyone that you do this and do that because they have the light.

340
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:39,020
In their own light they see the same thing, understand the same thing, they know what is right and what is wrong

341
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,620
and what is good for you, what is for your benevolence.

342
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:49,700
Of course, by the raising of this Kundalini, as I told you, many diseases can be cured physically.

343
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:57,120
We have three doctors in Delhi, those who have got M.D. after doing their M.B.B.S.

344
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:04,620
in the subject of sahaja yoga. They have cured people of some incurable diseases.

345
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:11,980
And now, there are seven doctors in England, also we have doctors here, two or three, who are collecting datas to show how

346
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:18,320
sahaja yoga can cure you without wasting your time into something

347
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:24,340
that we call as the medicines and all artificial things.

348
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:33,100
So many things can be done with your own power. You don't have to depend on anybody else

349
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:41,100
but the cleansing part of your being takes place when you become collective,

350
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:46,580
when you are together. Like supposing, a nail of Mine is broken, it won't grow.

351
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:52,800
It will be just left at the same point where it was thrown away.

352
00:40:53,100 --> 00:41:00,380
In the same way, if you are collective, the whole body of Spirituality will cleanse you completely,

353
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:07,740
will manifest all your powers, will give you what you're worth.

354
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,760
You have to know your glory, you have to know your beauty.

355
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:19,880
And no use condemning yourself that, "I'm a sinner, I've done this wrong, that wrong." After all you're human-beings

356
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,580
and as human-beings we're supposed to commit mistakes - we're not Gods.

357
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:30,140
So those people who tell you that, "You're a sinner, this thing, that thing," should see their own sins.

358
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:37,240
So please have no diffidence about yourself, no diffidence at all.

359
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:42,980
I assure you all of you can get realization, if you can just get over your diffidence.

360
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:51,360
It's one thing we have to accept that we're human-beings and we are

361
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:59,180
the epitome of evolution. We have evolved up to this state and a little more is needed which is

362
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:07,340
very easy and should happen to you - is already built-in within you, is already there. For example, see this instrument is

363
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:13,540
made but if it is not put to the mains, it has no meaning. In the same way you're to be put to the mains

364
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:19,840
and this All-Pervading power about which I'm saying, we start feeling it for the first time.

365
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:24,960
We see these beautiful flowers all around, we take them for granted.

366
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:32,180
How have they come out of this Mother Earth which looks so gross and out of one seed?

367
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,220
How these different flowers have come with different personalities?

368
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:42,120
We take them for granted. All the living work we take it for granted,

369
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:48,040
even ourselves. Look at our eye, what a camera it is! Look at our brain,

370
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:58,480
what a computer it is! We take it for granted. Why? Because we have no answer - we cannot say how.

371
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:05,900
But in sahaja yoga we'll know how it works out. I hope, you all will take your realization

372
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:11,260
and tomorrow again I'll tell you all about the Spirit, what the Spirit is.

373
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:16,260
You don't have to take Me for granted, again I'm saying that - blind faith is not needed

374
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:22,940
but as Scientist you must keep an open mind to test for yourself and see for yourself.

375
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:32,380
It will hardly take ten minutes, maybe, five minutes also for you to get your realization. There is no

376
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:41,460
necessity for you to have any kind of a reading done or any kind of a uh.. penance done.

377
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:50,520
As long as a human-being, you're a human-being and that you desire, very strongly,

378
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,600
your Self-realization, nothing more is needed.

379
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:58,920
This Kundalini is the power of your pure desire.

380
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:03,440
All other desires are not pure because they're never satiable.

381
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:11,980
So, this pure desire should be in your heart that, "I should get my Self-realization and let my, all my powers manifest."

382
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,820
I think, we can have some little time for questioning

383
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:24,840
but please don't ask Me unnecessary questions to waste time for everyone because

384
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:32,300
it's easy to answer because I'm now quite an expert

385
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:39,120
I've been working on this for twenty one years and I know all the Western minds how they work and the Eastern minds how they work

386
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:46,720
and I can answer all your questions still, I would request you that it's not important.

387
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:51,100
Even if I answer you, even if you are satisfied mentally

388
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:56,980
still, it's no guarantee that your Kundalini will rise.

389
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:05,040
Main thing is that your Kundalini must rise and you must get your Self-realization, which is the actualization of baptism.

390
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:13,440
Is actualization, it is not just putting My hand on your head and say that now you have got your realization or you have got your baptism.

391
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:21,800
This is what it is, so I would request you, if you have any questions, do ask Me, please. Thank you very much.

392
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:35,340
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - What did he say?
  -

393
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:41,680
- When You raise the Kundalini, don't you automatically raise the impurities and the chakras as well?
 - Yeah.

394
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:48,420
You see, the Kundalini is to be understood in a very proper way.

395
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:55,300
These are the chakras, say on the Left Sympathetic and the Right Sympathetic, when they meet they make the Parasympathetic Nervous System

396
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:02,400
and these are the centers. Now, when you start using too much of right or left side, then what happens that they become constricted.

397
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:08,820
Now, when the Kundalini rises, She doesn't rise the whole of Her own body -

398
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:16,120
it's like many strings put together like a rope - so some strings rise and they try to expand

399
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:23,760
this space by nourishing those centers but completely they're not nourished,

400
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:30,440
not nourished fully. Some people do have very beautiful uh.. balanced life,

401
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:38,800
they do get it but not mostly, they don't. So what happens, when the Kundalini rises, She passes through the, nourishes there

402
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:45,040
and pierces through your fontanel bone area but it's a very small thread, I should say, in the beginning

403
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:50,800
which passes through the very, very subtle uh.. channel, we call as Brahma nadi.

404
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:55,440
When it pierces through, then it opens this,

405
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:03,100
I should say, the, as the ego and conditioning part of it, these two open out and this thousand petalled

406
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:10,140
chakra, we call as the Sahastrara, the thousand petalled lotus also opens out.

407
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:17,260
When it opens out it gets connected, of course, but the connection is not established fully.

408
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:24,300
Even if you connect this, it may not be if it is little faulty, may not be established. So it has to be established.

409
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:31,540
That hardly, it takes a  month at the most, for some people it doesn't even take one day, even one minute.

410
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:40,060
So depends on. So we have to pay respect to ourselves and understand that if there's any problem, doesn't matter, we should correct it.

411
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:45,440
Then also you must know, what it is. You must have the full knowledge as to

412
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:52,400
what is this Kundalini, what you have achieved, what are your powers, how can you work it out

413
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:58,320
everything you must know because once you're enlightened, you should be able to give light to others.

414
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:06,220
After this happening, you can give realization to others - you get that power - you can cure people, you can put them right.

415
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:14,360
Even a person who is spiritually so awakened, even if he enters any place, peace comes in,

416
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,520
balance, equilibrium even in the nature comes in.

417
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:23,640
So, such a personality if you create within yourself,

418
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:30,220
you have to do it and that if it is required little time, you should give that time to yourself.

419
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,540
And then, when in a full way you become a really a Divine personality.

420
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:45,380
That's what we have to achieve but you don't have to give up your families, you don't have to give up your anything - it's something that happens within yourself.

421
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:51,320
And that should happen to all of us. It makes no difference what age you are, it makes no difference

422
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:57,160
what race you are, nothing of the kind. As long as you are a human-being, it works out.

423
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:09,460
[INAUDIBLE]

424
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:17,760
The question is, what is actually the meaning of the term realization and what actually is happening.

425
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,620
We have told them.

426
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:29,020
Actually happening is the awakening of the Kundalini and you are getting connected to the mains, means the All Pervading power,

427
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,260
which is all the time flowing through you.

428
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:39,680
Now, what is Self-realization, that I'm going to tell you tomorrow, as I said, but in short is that you know about your own centers.

429
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:45,060
You become aware of yourself firstly.

430
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:49,800
Many things happen but one of them is, on a physical level you know.

431
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:54,860
Now people get cancer they don't know if they're getting cancer, they become mad they don't know they're becoming mad.

432
00:49:55,560 --> 00:50:03,580
But you become knowledgeable, you can feel it, on your finger-tips you can feel it - your centers and the centers of others

433
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:09,600
so that you become collectively conscious. Your conscious, consciousness

434
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:17,300
is so much enlarged that you can feel the centers of other people. Sitting down here you can feel the centers of others.

435
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:21,120
Then you don't talk about a person as an Australian, Indian or anything

436
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:26,840
but you will say that this center is not all right, that center is not all right, this center is very good.

437
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,120
This is the language you start talking about.

438
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:38,760
And what happens is, such a lot, that in one lecture I don't think I can cover it.

439
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:46,420
But tomorrow, I'm sure, I'll be able to tell you elaborately what all the good things happen to a person who is a Self-realized.

440
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:55,140
First you get your Self-realization, is better. For example, you see here beautiful lights are here

441
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:00,620
and when you come, you have to just switch on one switch

442
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,840
because it's all built-in there, it's there existing.

443
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:10,860
What's the use of telling about all the history of these lights and the history of electricity

444
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:18,100
and all how it came here to Melbourne and how it was brought here. Better have your lights first and then we'll talk about it

445
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:22,640
otherwise it will be boring.

446
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:31,220
Any more questions?

447
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:42,440
I'm saying that [UNCLEAR]

448
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:50,540
[UNCLEAR]

449
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:57,660
[UNCLEAR]

450
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:05,760
[UNCLEAR]

451
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:13,260
[UNCLEAR]

452
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:21,500
- I didn't follow him.
 - The questioner is a little uncertain about the nature of the term

453
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:27,440
desiring the Spirit. In order to achieve the Spirit, you have to desire it

454
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:33,820
and that you have to have a purity of Spirit in order to achieve the Spirit.

455
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:39,900
You see, why I said you have to desire because God has given you freedom.

456
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:45,360
I cannot be disrespectful to that freedom.

457
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:50,820
If you don't desire, I cannot force on you, cannot be done.

458
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:59,080
You have to ask for it.

459
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:08,620
It cannot be forced, it cannot be... we cannot mesmerize people, we cannot do something like that,

460
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:12,720
you cannot force people, you cannot dominate -

461
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:19,020
it is your will which has to come. Only through your sweet will it will work out.

462
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:32,860
And do you know that many have written about this - like William Blake has written

463
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:41,560
that, "Men of God," - it's a special category of people  who are seekers of truth, it's a special category. He's described them

464
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:47,080
as, "Men of God will know God and they'll have powers to make others Godly."

465
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:53,220
So many have said about this in India also but I must say William Blake was a great seer

466
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,520
that he could see this so clearly what was going to happen in the future.

467
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,920
[INAUDIBLE]

468
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:14,360
- Why not have faith in Western medicine?
 - Annh?

469
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:19,980
- Why not have faith in Western medicine?
 - You should, why not. I did also western medicine, you must have.

470
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:26,980
But I'm saying, your faith in Western medicine is all right but they have no control over Parasympathetic Nervous System.

471
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:31,920
There're many things which cannot be answered by medical sciences

472
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:36,300
but if we can manage it with something else, why not do it.

473
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:55,420
- So quiet [UNCLEAR] They're in thoughtless awareness
 - Looks like questions are finished.
  - [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] All right.

474
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:09,360
Agnya chakra which is shown there. Then what happens

475
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:15,520
that these two conditioning and ego, these two institutions are sucked in like that.

476
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:22,040
With that you achieve a state which we call as

477
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:28,200
thoughtless awareness, called as 'nirvichar samadhi' in Sanskrit language.

478
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:33,420
Thoughtless awareness, means you are absolutely aware but there is no thought.

479
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:40,140
Otherwise we are always bombarded with thinking. Thoughts are coming whether you like it or not - you can't stop it.

480
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:47,600
Now, thoughts come either from the future or from the past.

481
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:55,960
In the present if I say, "Stop your thought," you cannot. And you cannot be in the present unless and until you stop your thoughts.

482
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:02,340
So, the first state that comes to you, that you become thoughtlessly aware

483
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:08,420
means you have a command over your thoughts. If you want you'll think otherwise you'll not think.

484
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:14,240
And you grow spiritually only when you are in the present.

485
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:19,520
If I say, "Pay attention to yourself," you can't. Say, "How to pay attention inside?"

486
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:29,540
But supposing Kundalini rises, then the attention, which we can say, like a sari like this and it pushes up

487
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:35,680
the attention. Attention, here, when it reaches

488
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:44,940
then the Grace starts falling or you can say the light starts falling on the attention and your attention becomes enlightened.

489
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:52,760
but you are in thoughtless awareness state.

490
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:58,860
Afterwards, when you have established your connections properly

491
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:04,800
then you are in the second state, that we call as doubtless awareness.

492
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:11,940
And this doubtless awareness state in which you start manifesting all your powers -

493
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,740
and this is what we have to achieve,

494
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:24,620
which is very easy, works out in a very simple way; of course, you don't have to pay at all for that.

495
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:33,220
And it works wonderfully because you get the proof of it.

496
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:43,760
You get these powers working and you understand that these powers are working.

497
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:52,820
You have to certify yourself - nobody is going to give you the certificate. It is you who's going to decide it.

498
00:57:55,500 --> 00:58:02,920
Is it all right now, should we have the session for Self-realization?

499
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:14,560
- Second [UNCLEAR]
 - [INAUDIBLE]

500
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:19,860
[INAUDIBLE]

501
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:27,440
Can you achieve a balance of the chakras through mantras and meditation or singing?

502
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:33,940
Of course, but it's a science; One has to know what to do exactly.

503
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:38,700
It's not just say any mantras. You see, these, there are people giving mantras

504
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:43,640
for 300 pounds or 6000 pounds - I mean, nonsense it is.

505
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:52,300
And mantras are related to your chakras, which you yourself will know.

506
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:57,780
But mostly it is not needed. If it is needed, you have to, may also have to do

507
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:02,440
some sort of a asana, as Hatha yoga is but very rarely.

508
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:10,900
So mantras do not play much role, unless and until, you have that problem then you have to use the mantras

509
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:16,620
but which is the chakra for which you need, you have to find out first of all.

510
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:24,240
That's only possible when the Kundalini rises, then you know where there is obstructed, then you have to use a particular mantra - that helps.

511
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:32,680
On the whole, all this knowledge is very easily available - it's not difficult - but first of all you must enter into the Kingdom of God

512
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:41,220
then you're looked after. Unless and until that has happened, is impossible - it will be just talk, talk and talk.

513
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:46,700
And you have had many talks, it should not be another talk to you

514
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:52,420
but it should happen - is the becoming.

515
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:05,440
All these things which we have known, part here, part there, something false, something true.-

516
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:09,900
in the light you see everything so clearly.

517
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:18,360
In the darkness of ignorance, you believe this is true, this is true, that should be such

518
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:25,500
but what you need, is the enlightened mind. Once you're enlightened, you are a different person altogether.

519
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:40,420
So now, please don't get worried

520
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:46,360
about yourself. You are all going to get your Self-realization.

521
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:51,580
Don't doubt yourself. That's the first condition is, relax.

522
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:57,880
Don't doubt yourself. You're all going to get your realization.

523
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:03,540
I have no doubts about it but if you doubt yourself, I can't help it.

524
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:11,360
Must have full confidence in yourself - that is the first condition.

525
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:17,960
The second condition is that,

526
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:23,620
you're not to feel guilty about anything, whatsoever.

527
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:37,460
It's a fashion these days also to feel guilty for nothing at all - specially in English language, we go on saying sorry, sorry, morning till evening.

528
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:45,720
Even on the telephone you see now in Our times We used to say 'beg your pardon' but nowadays people say sorry for that also. I don't know

529
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:49,340
for anything they go on saying sorry. What is there to be sorry about?

530
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:55,540
So, in short, you have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself.

531
01:01:57,020 --> 01:02:02,860
Don't have any diffidence. Whatever has been a mistake is all right, has to be corrected

532
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:10,360
and can be done very easily, if you have self-confidence. So please, don't feel guilty.

533
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:18,680
Don't start confessing in your mind, what wrong you have done to yourself or anything - please, please, don't.

534
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:27,620
And third condition is also very simple, if you understand, that you have to forgive everyone, in general.

535
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:34,820
Now, this people sometimes say is very difficult but logically understand.

536
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:40,260
Whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything - what do you do - nothing.

537
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:44,260
But when you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

538
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:50,420
Those who wanted to trouble you, are happy while you are the one who is feeling extremely

539
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:54,980
unhappy, all the time torturing yourself for the sake of others.

540
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:04,780
So just forgive everyone - take it out of your mind. Now since I've come to Australia,

541
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:12,320
I find, when I meet them, that they say, "Mother, difficult to forgive, difficult to forgive."

542
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:17,580
I mean, there's nothing difficult - it's your own mental nonsense - throw it away.

543
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:25,900
You'll feel so much lighter just now. Just say, "I forgive everyone." All those nonsensical people you need not even think of.

544
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:32,640
In general, you should say, "I've forgiven everyone," and you'll be very much better off.

545
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:37,580
These are the only three conditions, which are very easy - everybody can do it.

546
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:48,400
Now, I have to request you, that you have to take out your shoes, if possible, because this Mother Earth really helps us a lot.

547
01:03:55,060 --> 01:04:00,300
Now those who are sitting on the ground, it's all right but those who are not sitting on the ground, have to know

548
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:04,660
that you have to put your -

549
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:16,180
you can come in front, if you like, can come in front -

550
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:25,140
uh.. put your left foot away from the right because the left side represents

551
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:34,400
our power of desire. Now, medical science doesn't make difference between the left lobe and the right lobe of the brain but we do.

552
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:44,300
So we have to put the left foot away from the right foot and

553
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:53,440
we have to use our left hand to express our pure desire to get Self-realization -

554
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:56,920
is to put your left hand like this,

555
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:05,520
just like this as he's showing, left hand and the right hand is

556
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:10,640
the power of action. So, we'll use our right hand

557
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,320
to give nourishment to our centers.

558
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:25,000
This is to be done only today not all the time. Once you're realized, you don't have to do all this.

559
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:32,640
This is just for your realization and also for you to know how you can raise your own Kundalini just now.

560
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:41,460
So now, the left hand is towards Me suggesting that you are desirous of having Self-realization

561
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:47,380
and the right hand is to be used for your action.

562
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:58,020
I've already told you that I respect your freedom and those who do not want to have Self-realization

563
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:02,480
should not watch others and sit here.

564
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:08,720
They should go and that would be very civil of them, to do. But those who want

565
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:18,160
can have it very easily. But

566
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:24,600
whatever we get so easily without paying anything, sometimes we do not have respect for that.

567
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:31,660
But you don't know, this is the most precious thing to become a Spirit

568
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:39,500
and we should really respect the Self-realization and try to expand our awareness.

569
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:46,380
So please, put left hand towards Me and now the right hand on your heart.

570
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,880
In the heart resides the Spirit.

571
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:04,700
If you become the Spirit, you become your own guide, your own master, your own guru.

572
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:10,580
So, take your right hand in the upper portion of the abdomen

573
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:20,180
which is the center of - on the left hand side. We're working only on the left hand side - which is the center of your mastery.

574
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:28,600
Then you take your hand in the lower portion of the abdomen on the left hand side. This is the center

575
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:38,240
of pure knowledge - knowledge of the Divine laws and how to work them out.

576
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:44,660
When you get your Self-realization, you'll find,

577
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:49,340
first time you'll feel this All-Pervading power on your finger-tips,

578
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:54,900
Also you'll find a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area,

579
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:59,060
maybe warm in the beginning but later on cools down.

580
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:07,120
So, this power that you get, you should know how to use it

581
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:13,860
for your benevolence and for the benevolence of others. This is the pure knowledge.

582
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:19,260
Now, please take your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

583
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:26,340
and now again on your heart.

584
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:41,180
Now you have to put your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your hand to your right.

585
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:50,720
This center is caught up when you feel guilty and it's a very dangerous thing because

586
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:58,660
when this, this center is out of gear, you get a horrible disease called Angina,

587
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:06,940
you get spondylitis, also you get very lethargic organs. So please don't feel guilty.

588
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:13,300
Now, raise your hand to your forehead across, put your thumb on one side

589
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:18,780
and the fingers on the other and press it hard. Now, put it down your head.

590
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:23,480
This is the center for forgiving others.

591
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:32,680
Now, take this right hand - I'm just showing you now  and then we'll do it and I'll explain to you -

592
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:40,980
on the back side of your head. Now, push back your head as far as possible. This is the center,

593
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:48,600
without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, only for your satisfaction

594
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:52,520
you have to ask forgiveness from this All-Pervading power.

595
01:09:54,040 --> 01:10:01,420
Now, stretch your hand fully - the palm is to stretch fully -

596
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:08,960
and put the center of your palm on the fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood.

597
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:16,920
Now, put down your head as far as possible, now press it hard, your scalp, by pushing out

598
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:25,900
your fingers outward. Now, this is very important - push them out and now press it and move your scalp seven times -

599
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:33,120
you will know the reason for all this, why seven times you have to move it.

600
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:40,260
Press your scalp and put down your head -

601
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:46,340
clockwise, move it clockwise, seven times. That's all you have to do, that's all.

602
01:10:58,140 --> 01:11:04,660
Now, we have to close the eyes. You can take away your spectacles,

603
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:08,720
please see that your both the feet are away from each other.

604
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:17,020
If there's anything tight on your neck too much or on your waist, you can loosen it little bit and you have to be comfortable,

605
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:24,280
not to slouch nor to stretch too much but in a comfortable state, way, you have to sit down.

606
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:33,620
Now, please put the left hand towards Me, right hand on your heart and close your eyes.

607
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:38,400
Here, you have to ask Me a question in your heart -

608
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:44,660
you may call Me Mother or you may call Me Shri Mataji, whatever you feel like.

609
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:52,040
Ask a question in your heart, three times - a very fundamental question about yourself

610
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:55,520
"Mother, am I the Spirit?"

611
01:11:55,740 --> 01:12:01,560
"Mother, am I the Spirit?" ask this question three times in your heart.

612
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:30,740
If you are the Spirit, you are your master. So please, put your right hand

613
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:37,040
on the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it with your fingers - not very hard.

614
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:45,580
Here you ask another fundamental question in your heart, three times, "Mother, am I my own master?"

615
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,160
With full confidence ask this question.

616
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:05,140
Again, I cannot cross over your freedom - I respect it

617
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:10,880
and I cannot force pure knowledge on you - you have to ask for it.

618
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:18,540
So, please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen and press it hard.

619
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:22,840
on the left hand side. Here

620
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:29,400
please say six times because this center has got six petals.

621
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:39,380
"Mother, please give me pure knowledge. Mother, please give me pure knowledge," ask this six times.

622
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:55,780
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, the Kundalini starts moving upward.

623
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:01,340
So now,

624
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:07,620
with full confidence you have to open your higher centers.

625
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:13,880
Please, raise your right hand on the left hand side

626
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:18,300
of your abdomen in the upper portion and press it hard.

627
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:26,960
Here, you have to say with full confidence, ten times,

628
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:33,480
"Mother, I am my own master." Say it with full confidence,

629
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:42,320
complete self-confidence. "Mother, I am my own master." You have to say it ten times.

630
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:54,060
We have to know that we are not this body, this mind,

631
01:14:54,560 --> 01:15:01,060
this intellect, emotions, conditionings, ego

632
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:05,480
but we are pure Spirit.

633
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:14,100
This is the fundamental truth about yourself. So now, please raise your right hand

634
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:20,660
on your heart and with full confidence say, twelve times,

635
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:26,720
please say it twelve times, "Mother, I am the pure Spirit."

636
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:31,660
Please say it twelve times, "Mother, I am the,

637
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:36,080
I am the pure Spirit," twelve times, please.

638
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:54,340
Another thing we have to know that this All-Pervading power of God's love,

639
01:15:54,880 --> 01:16:00,900
is the ocean of knowledge, is the ocean of compassion and bliss

640
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:08,560
but above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness and whatever mistakes we might have committed

641
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:14,840
can be easily dissolved by the power of this ocean of forgiveness.

642
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:21,960
So, please forgive yourself and now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder,

643
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:27,800
push it as far back as possible and turn your head to your right.

644
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:32,880
Here, you have to say sixteen times,

645
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:42,080
with full confidence, "Mother, I am not guilty at all."

646
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:47,780
Please say it sixteen times.

647
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:54,060
You don't judge yourself, let your Kundalini judge.

648
01:16:55,340 --> 01:17:02,300
"Mother, I am not guilty at all," please say it sixteen times.

649
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:07,500
This center has the maximum number of petals - sixteen petals.

650
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:14,500
This center looks after your ear, nose, throat, face, everything, your tongue, your eyes.

651
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:29,100
I have already told you whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything

652
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:33,560
but if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands

653
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:43,180
so, in general, you have to forgive everyone not remembering anyone of the people who have troubled you.

654
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,180
Now, raise your right hand

655
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:53,080
on your forehead, across, put your thumb on one side

656
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:59,560
and fingers on the other. Now press it hard.

657
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:03,800
Please bend your head as far as possible.

658
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:10,920
Here, without thinking of anybody else

659
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:17,940
just, in general, you have to say, "Mother, I forgive everyone."

660
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:27,260
or, "Mother, I forgive everyone in general." Say it from your heart, not how many times but from your heart.

661
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:47,400
Now, please take your hand on the back side of your head and push it back as far as possible.

662
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:56,860
Here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, you have to say

663
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:05,560
with full confidence, "Oh Divine power, please forgive me

664
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:11,960
if I have done anything wrong against you knowingly or unknowingly.

665
01:19:12,860 --> 01:19:19,400
"Oh Divine power, please forgive me if I have done anything wrong against you

666
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:27,360
knowingly or unknowingly." This you're going to say for your satisfaction from your heart - not how many times.

667
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:42,560
Now the last center which is very important. Please stretch your hand

668
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:55,680
and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area which was the soft bone in your childhood.

669
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:06,300
Please put down your head as far as possible, push back your fingers.

670
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:22,600
Please push back your fingers, put a good pressure on your scalp. Here again, I respect your freedom -

671
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:29,720
I cannot force Self-realization on you so you have to say seven times,

672
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:36,040
"Mother, please give me Self-realization, my second birth,"

673
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:43,400
and you just move your scalp, very slowly, seven times,  saying that.

674
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:52,940
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

675
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:57,980
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

676
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:05,100
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE] Push back your fingers, push back, push back your fingers other there's no pressure.

677
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:12,180
Put down your heads, please put down, put down your heads. Please put down your heads, push back your finger.

[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

683
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:41,200
Now, please take down your hands. Put both the hands towards Me, like this.

684
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:48,600
Open your eyes, you can wear your spectacles also. Put both the hands towards Me, like this.

685
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:57,240
Now, put the right hand towards Me, like this, put down your head and see for yourself if there's a cool or a hot

686
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:00,900
breeze like waves coming from your head.

687
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:07,760
Bend your head and see for yourself. Don't put your hand on top of your head, away from it.

688
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:14,720
Some people get it far away, some get it nearer. Just see, if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming inside.

689
01:22:23,740 --> 01:22:27,240
Now, please put the left hand towards Me

690
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:36,320
and bend your head and see for yourself now

691
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:42,580
with the right hand, if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head.

692
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:55,040
Again with the right hand, please try again with the right hand.

693
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:08,500
See yourself, if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming.

694
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:17,340
Now, raise your both the hands towards the sky, like this

695
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:28,940
and ask a question, three times, "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

696
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:36,920
Or you can ask, "Mother, is this the All-Pervading power of God's love?"

697
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:45,380
Or you can ask, "Mother, is this the Param Chaitanya?" Ask anyone of these questions. These are the names of only one

698
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:53,620
thing which is the All-Pervading power of Divine love which does all the living work.

699
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:57,360
Just ask anyone of these questions, three times

700
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:08,120
Push back your head towards the sky. Please, put down your hands now.

701
01:24:10,340 --> 01:24:13,440
Just put the hands like this.

702
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:23,660
You can become thoughtless, you can watch Me without thinking. Just put [UNCLEAR]

703
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:30,300
Now, those who have felt - please put down your hands

704
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:35,200
Put your hands like this. Now,

705
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:44,540
those who have felt cool or warm or hot breeze like waves

706
01:24:44,780 --> 01:24:48,960
on the fingers, on the hands

707
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:54,460
or out of the fontanel bone area please raise both your hands.

708
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:05,560
So, that's it! May God bless you!

709
01:25:05,820 --> 01:25:10,260
Everyone seems to have got it except for very few people who haven't.

710
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:17,700
Very few didn't get it - doesn't matter, you'll get it tomorrow, it's all right.

711
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:24,640
You shouldn't doubt, that's the main point is the doubting and you should forgive, most of you.

712
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:30,860
Except for 3-4 people, I think, most of you have got it so, May god bless you!.

713
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:37,440
I hope to see you tomorrow again and tomorrow

714
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:41,740
I'll meet all of you, individually, all of you.

715
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:49,240
Now, you have to inform your friends and everyone, that they should come and we should have more people

716
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:56,700
because I'm here only for tomorrow and then I'll come back after two years,

717
01:25:56,900 --> 01:26:03,400
one year. I shouldn't say two years, will  be too much. All right, so I would request you

718
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:10,080
that you should inform your friends, you should inform your relations

719
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:13,720
because this is the only thing you can give it to them.

720
01:26:14,980 --> 01:26:18,560
Now, you have reached a state where you are thoughtless,

721
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:25,920
so don't argue with people who haven't got it. Those who haven't got it will also get it tomorrow and those who have got it,

722
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:31,240
should know that you have to maintain it - like keeping the peace in your heart

723
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:35,040
and not arguing about it and quarreling with others

724
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:40,420
because those who won't get it will start saying something - doesn't matter, makes no difference.

725
01:26:40,740 --> 01:26:46,720
You have got it, so keep your experience with yourself and we have to share it with others, so many

726
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:49,960
in Melbourne. May God bless you!

727
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:53,120
Tomorrow
