1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,120
I must have said lots of things about Christ before,

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:13,800
and how Jesus Christ is related to Shri Radhaji,

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,120
that He is the incarnation

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,720
of Sri Ganesha who was the son of the Adi Shakti

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,360
to begin with but then He was given to Shri Radhaji

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:33,440
and Shri Radha created as Mahalaxmi, as Mother Mary

7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,480
this great incarnation of Christ.

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,880
Now for the western mind it is impossible to understand

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,560
how there can be a immaculate conception

10
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,080
because they have no sense at all, no sensitivity at all

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,040
to spiritual life. We Indians can understand it,

12
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,440
is very easy for Indians to understand

13
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,560
because we had Sri Ganesha created that way.

14
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,360
We just believe it we don't doubt these things.

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,760
Whatever is said about God is not to be doubted

16
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,080
with this limited brain, that's not done in India.

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,200
But in the west, from the very birth of Christ

18
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,720
they have had arguments, arguments, arguments, arguments

19
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,320
with this limited brain they had,

20
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,240
and the whole religion in the name of Christ

21
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:29,560
is just a perversion, such a horrible things have been said

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:38,240
that it's unbelievable. His purity, His  holiness, His  auspiciousness

23
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,920
is never understood in the west I think.

24
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,240
Those who follow Christianity, how can they be so debased

25
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,720
in their moral character. They're all right for their political,

26
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,800
their economical you can say, their legal side but their moral sense

27
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,720
is absolutely missing. Is very surprising,

28
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,000
those who are the followers of Christ

29
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,920
should have the greatest amount of morality.

30
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,960
He has said that thou shalt not have adulterous eyes,

31
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,720
such a subtle thing, even the eye should not have adultery,

32
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:30,960
should not have lust and greed. Such a subtle thing He has said it,

33
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,240
and just think in the west people could not follow it

34
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,640
because the whole religion got perverted

35
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:45,640
under the influence of Paul and Peter. It's a very serious thing

36
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,760
they have done against Christ, it's still going on.

37
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,280
Still this Catholic church, though being exposed so much,

38
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,960
is still going on, in India also all over,

39
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,120
is stupid this Protestant church also is going on everywhere.

40
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:06,040
What good name have they brought to Christ? One should see.

41
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,080
The first and foremost thing He has said

42
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:16,720
that you must enter into the Kingdom of God,

43
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,960
that you must be born again.

44
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,120
So it's all mental, you are born again,

45
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,760
you have a certificate, you are born again, finished.

46
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,680
So this mental attitude of the west is responsible

47
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,520
for killing the great incarnation of Christ,

48
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,800
I think is another crucifixion.

49
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,640
Mentally you cannot understand spirituality.

50
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,080
So they were telling your brain trust, brain trust,

51
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,800
I said brain trusting-I can't understand in Sahaja Yoga.

52
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:05,640
In Sahaja Yoga what is the brain trust? Where is the brain?

53
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,720
In thoughtless awareness where is the brain?

54
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,520
So this brain trust business might be all right

55
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,600
for any other place but for Sahaja Yoga, I still don't understand

56
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,800
what do you do in brain trust. Because some people

57
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,200
want to come on the stage and speak you see,

58
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:36,160
they have a kind of a madness, they can't get over it.

59
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,720
So they might be coming to the brain trust maybe,

60
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:49,080
but it's not brain, it's the heart, is the heart

61
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:55,240
which has to be opened out because with the brain

62
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,520
what we do is all kinds of materialism.

63
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,360
All kinds of nonsense has come from human brain only,

64
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,520
not so much from animals brain.

65
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:14,120
You can see  if you go to any forest it's clean, nice,

66
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,560
smelling so well,  but put one human being there and you will know

67
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,080
that this filth, dirt has come from some human being.

68
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:32,240
So as it is they have made a mess of all the great incarnations

69
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:39,400
but worst is done to Christ and I feel what a waste it was.

70
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,880
So we must understand Christ

71
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,680
in the right sense, He is the eternal child,

72
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,040
He is the innocence itself, He's the source of innocence

73
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,200
and He is the bestower of all blessings in all chakras.

74
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,600
But that doesn't mean that you are Christians, you should be very

75
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,400
proud that oh She's talking about Christ.

76
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,960
Many I've seen Sahaja Yogis are still identified with Christ

77
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,320
while they have nothing to do with Christ at all.

78
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,560
Now one has to understand that how Christ in His  miraculous life

79
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,040
has shown so many miracles.

80
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,440
First of all His  birth was immaculate.

81
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,800
So now they are discussing the birth of Mary

82
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,440
whether it's immaculate or not. For all incarnations

83
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,440
every kind of birth is immaculate, they are beyond sins,

84
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,760
they are special people. They may come as human beings,

85
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,120
they may come as angels, they may come as anything,

86
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,600
they are divine and we should understand

87
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,240
that this little brain of ours cannot discuss about them

88
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:05,400
and talk about them but is to just surrender and worship them.

89
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,000
They are much beyond us.

90
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,280
So for the western mind it is important to understand

91
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,000
that the life of Christ was such a blessing for them

92
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,040
that they have lost it, they have wasted it

93
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,880
and they have never understood how to respect it.

94
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,760
The whole thing became

95
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:37,720
like a political, economical, nonsensical fraud.

96
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,280
I have told you long time back that how we can prove

97
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,680
that Christ was Ganesha and He was the logos,

98
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,240
He was the what we call is the Brahmanat, the first sound.

99
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:04,600
By looking at your left side from the right side,

100
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,320
if you see the Mooladhara you will see swastikas

101
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,040
because it is made of carbon atom.

102
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,720
If you see from left to the right you can see Omkara

103
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:24,600
and if you see from down upward it looks like Alpha and Omega.

104
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,720
In those days Christ has said I am the Alpha and I am the Omega

105
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,800
and now we have made the animation,

106
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,680
we have no arrangement to show you there,

107
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,120
I don't know if you could arrange it somehow,

108
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,880
but you can see it clearly, what I have said can be proved.

109
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,200
So as you worship Ganesha you must worship Christ

110
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,840
in the same manner for all those who worship Ganesha.

111
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:56,120
Because I have seen that Hindus, they are stuck to Ganesha

112
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:04,600
and Christians are stuck to Christ, even after coming to Sahaja Yoga

113
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,720
they carry those traits. Ganesha is all right up to a point

114
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,720
and then it is important

115
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,880
we must pray to His  incarnation that is Christ.

116
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,880
In the same way those who worship Christ must also worship Ganesha

117
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,320
because He is the source, He is the potential of Christ.

118
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,680
All this was in the Divine plan, done with Divine discretion,

119
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,440
everything was done so beautifully but as I told you

120
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,200
human beings are good at massacring anything that is beautiful

121
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,720
and that's how it has happened. It's very, very sad

122
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,640
and on His  birthday today we have to decide

123
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,400
that He has to be born within us again, in a proper way,

124
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,640
that He is the Alpha and the Omega.

125
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,920
At that time of His  time I didn't know that anybody knew

126
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,240
about these symbols. These symbols also must have come

127
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,160
from unconscious to some of the great mathematicians

128
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,560
in long time and that's why these symbols

129
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,600
are used exactly like Alpha and Omega,

130
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:28,720
you see him clearly. It is so clear cut now in Sahaja Yoga,

131
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,720
we can prove so many things all tangible;

132
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:37,720
how Christ used to cure people, what did He do, it's all tangible,

133
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,840
we can prove it now in Sahaja Yoga, how it works out,

134
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,680
how these powers work out, but we have to first of all

135
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:53,120
cleanse our lives, we have to lead a very honest,

136
00:10:53,240 --> 00:11:00,320
powerful and pure life. I've seen those stalls outside,

137
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,720
I told them not to put up any stalls here

138
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,760
because they are making profit for themselves not for Sahaja Yoga.

139
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,320
Once Christ saw like that and He took a hunter and hit all of them,

140
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,360
now I can't do that. One should not encourage these people,

141
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,200
it's not a shopping centre, you have come for meditation.

142
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,000
Is all right if you need anything we have bought things for you,

143
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,160
if you buy them, there might be little profit, may not be,

144
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,040
but that will go to Sahaja Yoga, is not going to be used

145
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,760
for any private purpose. But these people from outside come

146
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,840
and put up a stall and you all run about means

147
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,720
you are still hanging around with that thing,

148
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,520
you have come here for what?

149
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,280
One should be all the time meditative in Ganapatipule,

150
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,640
all the time you should be in a meditative condition

151
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,880
and shouldn't get to these mundane things

152
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,760
which you always do outside also.

153
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,720
But these people know that you still have those weaknesses,

154
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,720
that's why they have put up the stalls.

155
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,160
Leaders should stop all this nonsense, I've told not to eat outside.

156
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,000
Last time all of you suffered because of that

157
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,160
but still the stalls are on, that means see they know

158
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,120
there are some culprits who would like to buy things from them

159
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,120
and get sick and bring bad name to Sahaja Yoga.

160
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,880
So the first thing of Ganesha is that wisdom,

161
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,680
and that wisdom we see in the life of Christ,

162
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,440
from the very beginning, He was so confident of it

163
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:02,400
that at the age of twelve years He went and talked to these parses,

164
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,080
means the people who were priests, we still have priests

165
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,080
and mullahs and these burgees and all of them,

166
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:15,120
these so called dharmamantandas, all over,

167
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,200
but He went and argued with them at that young age

168
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,000
and He was just saying what are you doing here.

169
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,840
What is this? What are you talking, all lip service.

170
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,280
He was discussing and talking to them

171
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,440
but His  parents were perhaps, were frightened that these people

172
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,000
might kill him so they brought him to India,

173
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,120
He came to India for wisdom.

174
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,640
I don't know where is that wisdom missing now from Indians,

175
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,640
but must be this country was full of wisdom when He came

176
00:13:52,760 --> 00:14:00,400
and stayed in India and we have lots of memories

177
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:06,760
about him, even the King Shaliman met him, is described in his book

178
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,040
that He met a man in Cashmere who was very saintly

179
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,200
and He asked him what's your name?

180
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:20,400
He said my name is Isa, see now imagine-Isa.

181
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:26,320
I is the word used in the Vedas for the Adi Shakti-

182
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,640
Sa means with.He said my name is Isa,

183
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,640
He said from what country do you come.

184
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,760
He said I come from a country which is foreign to me

185
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,640
and this is my country.

186
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,200
So this India, the Bharat, the Hindustan

187
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:51,080
was the country of spirituality, and one should not try to compete

188
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,720
and feel inferior to other countries

189
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,600
who have gone up materially higher,

190
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,080
you don't know where they are,

191
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,000
but we should be spiritually higher,

192
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,680
that's what Christ said. This is my own country, is clearly written,

193
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,080
that means Christ recognised

194
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,480
that this country of spirituality is His  own.

195
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,720
So we belong to that country of spirituality

196
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,400
and not to the materialistic

197
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,160
or to the mundane or the baser type of life.

198
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:40,480
In His  life time which was so very short,

199
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:48,440
whatever He has said, every word is great but as I told you

200
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:55,680
that this Paul tried to completely change, re-edit the bible

201
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:01,200
and he's put lots of things in there, whatever weaknesses he has,

202
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,520
he has put them nicely.

203
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:10,960
Now recently I've got a book which was hidden in a jar in Egypt

204
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:16,200
for about, till fifty years they discovered it,

205
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,040
and this book is called as the Library of Hamadhi.

206
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,760
The place was called Hamadhi

207
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,680
were it was discovered, and what Christ has said,

208
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,840
what Thomas has written, when Thomas was coming to India

209
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,880
he put all these things there, is very interesting.

210
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,160
About drinking, he said drinking begets debauchery,

211
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:40,720
it's a bad word to use and while Christians don't know.

212
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:45,560
On the contrary they think that drinking is allowed in Christianity,

213
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,120
very nicely. Was He mad to allow drinking?

214
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,640
How can He allow drinking

215
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,880
which goes against your awareness,

216
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,240
but they thought it was nice,

217
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:07,600
and that's what people have been using as a big attraction

218
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,720
that you can drink in Christianity.

219
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,600
So in the other religion, like Catholic religion,

220
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,760
you could have only once the Marriage.

221
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,800
So they have one marriage and ten keeps,

222
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,320
is all right, allowed, in the bible is written,

223
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,960
only you can have one marriage you cannot divorce,

224
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,520
do what you like. No sense of morality

225
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:41,120
and everything came like a derailment towards themselves

226
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,760
and they accepted one after another, all kinds of nonsense,

227
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:51,240
and the basic thing of Christ's life is morality.

228
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,880
He is on the left side as you can see he's from Sri Ganesh

229
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,000
and then He establishes himself at Agnya,

230
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,600
but morality is the essence of His  life,

231
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,440
what we call in India language His  character.

232
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:20,280
Our character is how we lead a life of purity.

233
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,560
We indulge into all kinds of nonsense,

234
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:29,200
I mean if you go to the west you'll be amazed what things they do.

235
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,040
I mean you cannot even believe it

236
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,560
and I cannot even mention it to you, you won't believe

237
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,840
that these so called advanced countries

238
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,320
are advancing towards what.

239
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:47,240
Impossible we cannot conceive it even,

240
00:18:48,320 --> 00:19:01,400
such an impurity, such a horrible, destructive immorality,

241
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,440
and I don't know from where it comes,

242
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,600
I think it's something wrong with the genetics,

243
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:11,120
from where do they get these ideas. One after another

244
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:16,520
it's impossible to believe these people doing all these things

245
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,160
and then nicely dress up and go to church on Sunday,

246
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:27,880
pray to God and come back. Now it is for you to decide,

247
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,240
you have to pull out all these people in your own countries

248
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,680
and you have to tell them

249
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,880
this is all nonsense in the name of Christ, in the name of God.

250
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,800
You have to come up and talk about it,

251
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:49,760
same about Sri Ganesh. I have seen in Poona, I was surprised,

252
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:55,200
there was Ganesh ........... everybody was drinking nicely,

253
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,720
the horrible dirty songs, some western songs,

254
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,640
some horrible cinema songs put up there

255
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:08,880
and everybody was using as a disco in front of Sri Ganesh.

256
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,960
Sahaja Yogis should go and object to this kind of a nonsense

257
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,760
they are in, that how could they drink in the presence of Sri Ganesh.

258
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:27,880
No wisdom of Sri Ganesha, no respect for His  auspiciousness.

259
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,920
Now not only drinking, doing all kinds of things.

260
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,440
Sri Ganesha has been shown by these tantrikas

261
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,680
as something so horrible, which is also done

262
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,720
by so many psychologists, so called, in the west.

263
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,160
Thank God one of them, th is Mr. Freud is exposed now.

264
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:57,600
So the another quality of Ganesha, is shown in Christ's life,

265
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:05,360
is a devotion to Mother. In that book,

266
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:12,080
Mary is telling them about knowledge,

267
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,800
but this Paul objects to it,

268
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,120
and She says that this is what you have to achieve.

269
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,760
But he doesn't want to, he is arguing with her,

270
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:35,080
but then Thomas said that what Christ has said on the Cross

271
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:42,720
"Behold the Mother". She is the Mother of Christ

272
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:48,000
and how dare he insult Her  but just the opposite,

273
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:55,840
Paul never respected women, so he appointed,

274
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,000
I mean he called Her  as just a woman.

275
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,600
No respect for Mahalaxmi, no respect.

276
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,280
Can you imagine, just a woman,

277
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,440
and a big controversy going on

278
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,960
on these so called advanced people whether the women

279
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,520
should be ordained as priests or not.

280
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,000
We think we are very backward

281
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:28,720
but I think they are so backward in religion, nonsense.

282
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:35,480
We had [...] such people here and we respect the Mother

283
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,080
as the Adi Shakti, she is the one we call her,

284
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,160
the one who has created us.

285
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,720
She is the one who looks after us,

286
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,840
for us she is important, Shakti is important,

287
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,600
they don't call her Shakti but a woman,

288
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,960
and supposed to be very advanced people,

289
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,240
and all other nonsense they do in the name of advancement.

290
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:14,240
It's impossible to tell, my words fall short, feel so ashamed.

291
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,520
In the name of Christ!

292
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:24,640
Today now when we are celebrating the pure life of Christ,

293
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,760
He came on this earth. They can't believe

294
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,560
that He could have been so pure. A criminal cannot believe

295
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,480
that others could be non criminal.

296
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:46,200
So we have to within ourselves see if we have developed

297
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:52,760
that purity of mind that expresses through our eyes.

298
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,840
Eyes have to become innocent, otherwise they have no effect.

299
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,400
If you are hankering after attracting other people

300
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,120
and charming other people and all that,

301
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,560
you are not a Sahaja Yogi, there's no need.

302
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,960
Once the light is within yourself, people will know.

303
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,040
As Sahaja Yogis you have to have

304
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,800
the light of Christ in your own life.

305
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:32,960
He was a young man who came on this earth, and how He lived.

306
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:39,080
He had nothing to do with Mary Magdalen, who was a prostitute,

307
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,120
but He stood by truth, and when people started stoning her

308
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,720
He stood up and said those who have   not committed any sin

309
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,480
can throw the stone at me. What a strength of truth.

310
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:02,560
So not that only He was a pure personality but purity also

311
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:07,680
is expressed in truth and His  compassion and love.

312
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:14,160
Such compassion He has expressed, such compassion.

313
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,360
I think Sri Ganesha got a little transformation.

314
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,600
Sri Ganesha is definitely very compassionate to people

315
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:29,680
who are worshipping him but those who go against them

316
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:35,760
He hits them hard.............they have to suffer,

317
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,480
AIDS , this, that, everything comes.

318
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:47,280
But those who are pure people, Sri Ganesha protects.

319
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,400
But Christ is compassionate, He forgives

320
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,800
because He believes that there could be a transformation.

321
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:01,720
At the level of Sri Ganesha He thinks is better

322
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,640
that let them be killed and be born again

323
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,280
because they're so impure but Christ had hopes

324
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,720
that He can transform people,

325
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,600
but He could not, they crucified him.

326
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,200
What wonderful people they must have been to crucify Christ.

327
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,320
Brainless we should call them, absolutely

328
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,840
without any understanding about spirituality,

329
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:38,480
very insensitive to true knowledge.

330
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,960
So for Sahaja Yoga, only the wise can follow.

331
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,680
It is not meant for stupid idiotic people

332
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,400
nor it is meant for very smart ones.

333
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,440
Some people think they are very smart

334
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,240
because they are successful in life,

335
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,600
they can say some smart sentences, they can say something very,

336
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,840
outstandingly very sharp, it's not meant for that.

337
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:16,280
For that Christ has said meek in heart will inherit the earth.

338
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,800
Meek in heart, not those who think too much of themselves

339
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:27,240
but for meek in heart will inherit the earth.

340
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,640
Among Sahaja Yogis also only those who are meek in heart

341
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,960
will inherit the blessing of Mother.

342
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,720
You have to be meek,

343
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,400
you have to be wise and with wisdom you'll become meek

344
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,680
because then you will see where are we

345
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,680
into this great cosmos,

346
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,720
that, you will feel that you have entered into this Kingdom of God.

347
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:02,000
For what? How? How have we come here?

348
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,720
How have you entered here? So many tried,

349
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:11,600
thousands of years sacrificing this,  sacrificing that,

350
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,520
standing on their heads, fasting.

351
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,840
How is it suddenly we got this blessing?

352
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,240
How are we there?

353
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:26,240
When we start looking at this,   we become meek.

354
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,400
Is the blessing, is the grace.

355
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,720
It's not through our ego, through our conditionings

356
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,480
but is just the grace,

357
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,840
the compassion, the love the Sandrakaruna,

358
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,680
and then you enjoy your transformed life,

359
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:55,600
the new dimension of spirituality which is in reality.

360
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,000
Now you know reality, you know totality, you know everything

361
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,040
but those who have not known themselves

362
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,680
have not become Sahaja Yogis.

363
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,680
Tukarama has said in very simple words,

364
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:18,400
the one who has known himself is the last one.

365
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,840
You can judge the chakras of others

366
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,560
but you can't judge your own chakras,

367
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,400
you can introspect others,

368
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,160
you can judge others but you cannot judge yourself.

369
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,760
You know everything about others but about yourself

370
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:36,800
you don't know anything, then you are not Sahaja Yogis.

371
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,240
First thing you must know yourself.

372
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,720
What sort of an ego stuff I am doing.

373
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,800
What sort of a conditioning I have got.

374
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,480
Even now people have so many conditionings.

375
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,520
So there's a new discipline of Sahaja Yoga,

376
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,840
in the new discipline you have to be meek, humble

377
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,240
and you have to be wise.

378
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,080
Every step of yours, every talk of yours,

379
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,520
everything should express wisdom

380
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,080
and the Sahaj discipline which automatically stops you

381
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,760
from doing wrong things.

382
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,760
Now say I'm walking down and some lady suddenly

383
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,600
falls at My feet without even understanding that I am just walking,

384
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,320
I may fall down or catches hold of My feet.

385
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,840
Is all self oriented.

386
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,520
I should see Mother, I should go and meet Her,

387
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,320
I touched Her feet, is all ego.

388
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,680
A Sahaja Yogi stands in the back,

389
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,120
real Sahaja Yogi is at the back.

390
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,560
From there he can enjoy because he knows I am everywhere.

391
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:59,280
He doesn't want to see Me, nothing, just like this, standing.

392
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,760
He doesn't force his way in any way.

393
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,640
Mother is here.

394
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:15,160
But this is what it is Christ has said, meek in heart.

395
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:19,080
There's a very big word "meek" and people don't understand meek

396
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,960
because in the west if you are meek people say you are weak,

397
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,760
you have to be aggressive. If they have to praise somebody

398
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,960
they'll say, oh he is very good, he is very aggressive.

399
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,280
I think their genetics are little lower than normal,

400
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:37,480
must be some animals in them otherwise how can they think

401
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,280
that to be aggressive is being something higher.

402
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:50,080
It's impossible, how can a person who is

403
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:55,120
supposed to be a higher person, could be like a devil.

404
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,360
How could Hitler say that he was a higher race

405
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,120
when he was himself a devil?

406
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,600
Is very nice for a devil to say I am a higher race.

407
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:15,280
So in dealing in Sahaja Yoga, the sweetness of natural meekness

408
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:20,960
not artificial of a businessman but a natural one

409
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:31,040
that makes you shine with your great, great spirituality.

410
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,640
Nobody can touch you, I have told you, except for you.

411
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,160
You can only fall down but nobody can touch you,

412
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,240
you are all protected from every angle.

413
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,040
B ut if you want to hit yourself, I can't help it.

414
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,240
So again we come to Tukarama saying,

415
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:54,960
as Christ has said "know thyself ".

416
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,120
First and foremost thing of introspection is: "Know thyself".

417
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,280
What you are doing,

418
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,120
are you trying to look at yourself or not?

419
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:21,520
He has also said that we see a big beam into the eyes of others,

420
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,240
then it's all right, but the beam is in your eyes

421
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,360
and you start seeing the beam in others eyes and that's the point.

422
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,120
So in your meditation you have to sit down

423
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,720
and first of all introspect: "Oh Christ,

424
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,280
Oh Sri Ganesha,  please give me wisdom to see myself

425
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:53,160
and understand what's wrong with me, and understand

426
00:33:53,280 --> 00:34:00,760
where do I lack all the qualities of a good Sahaja Yogi.

427
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:09,000
Just to meditate and you feel so happy, so joyous,

428
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:13,240
because virtue within you gives you joy.

429
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,760
But you don't say I'm virtuous, you don't say that,

430
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,760
but the virtue within you, when you discover,

431
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,440
that gives you joy

432
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:28,640
and not your bad qualities and your hankerings,

433
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,400
your lust and greed, no it does not.

434
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:39,680
So we must really concentrate, even coming to Sahaja Yoga

435
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:45,880
people think how I can use it for say fame?

436
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:51,000
Leadership you see is another myth. Then they sometimes think

437
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,920
why not use it for making some money some how.

438
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,000
Some sort of a business they start.

439
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:02,720
Don't do any business with Sahaja Yoga or Sahaja Yogis,

440
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,600
I've told a hundred times, if you do it you'll be in trouble

441
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,840
and then don't come and tell me the trouble.

442
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:15,800
Sahaja Yoga is only God' s business, that's all.

443
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:24,240
Everything that you are doing is for God and

444
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:28,080
that's why you are doing it for your self.

445
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,040
So introspection is very important,

446
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,760
criticising others should be less and criticising yourself

447
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,960
and laughing at yourself is the best.

448
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,960
I laugh at myself many a times

449
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,040
and say many things like that, if you have noticed,

450
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,600
that makes life so interesting.

451
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,080
That will kill your ego.

452
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,680
How I am trying to assert myself

453
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,960
and where is the meekness that Christ has talked about.

454
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,640
It is a natural goodness within us.

455
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:12,520
Once it shines and shows, you become so beautiful, so loveable.

456
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,560
Whether you are sitting here near Me or there

457
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,080
I know who is that kind.

458
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:23,840
My heart just opens for such a personality.

459
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:27,120
I know who they are.

460
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:36,160
But even if I know I will never tell you,

461
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,960
it is better that you know yourself.

462
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:44,880
"Know thyself" is His  message,

463
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,720
in the real way not with deception

464
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:52,040
because you are deceiving yourself, whom are you deceiving,

465
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,720
know thyself without any deception,

466
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:06,880
without any lies, with full concentration.

467
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:13,080
See where is your attention going, that's how you are going to rise,

468
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,560
you are not going to rise by seeing the defects of others

469
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:21,200
but you are going to rise only by seeing your own defects.

470
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,400
Exactly this what Christ has said,

471
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:28,520
I am telling you in very, very simple words.

472
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:35,040
Then He has said love thy neighbour as thyself which is a very, very

473
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,200
big thing to say. Now is only possible in Sahaja Yoga

474
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:43,680
because you are collective, those who are not collective

475
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,520
how can they love their neighbour. I mean who is the neighbour then,

476
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,160
nobody's the neighbour, they're outsiders,

477
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,920
but as soon as you become collective,

478
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,720
see today there are fifty five nations, you are all so collective,

479
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,240
so moral, so beautiful, no complications, nothing,

480
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,880
I am so overjoyed to see that

481
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,720
but to make it perfect we should introspect.

482
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,200
Socially, collectively you people have improved a lot

483
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,200
but also individually within yourself

484
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,360
you have to improve for your own goodness.

485
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,720
So on this great occasion, we have to celebrate

486
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:31,240
because really such a great amount of work was done by Christ

487
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,880
though neutralised by these horrible priests,

488
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,800
which is done in every country, in every religion

489
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,840
but now we should take a vow to save others

490
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,280
who are taking the name of Christ and doing something

491
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,680
just the opposite. If it could be done, if it could be achieved

492
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,600
through your lives,  Christ's work has been done.

493
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:01,680
You have to now express Christ through your life.

494
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,240
This is what it is.

495
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:09,320
Through your life you can express it, through the purity,

496
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,160
through the meekness, through the compassion

497
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:22,320
and the wisdom of Christ. Absolutely fearless was he

498
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,000
and that's why you have to be fearless

499
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:30,880
because you have to be only afraid of God and nobody else,

500
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,560
that's all and if you have done nothing wrong then there's nothing

501
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,320
to be afraid of God also because He loves you very much.

502
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:48,840
So be clear cut about everything, be understanding,

503
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:54,560
you are all loveable people no doubt but you should be such

504
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,320
that you can adore yourself and love yourself

505
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,840
because of the virtues you have.

506
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,920
May God Bless you all.
