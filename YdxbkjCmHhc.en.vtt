WEBVTT

06:56.933 --> 07:09.953
Today in this beautiful place created by the queen of Austria,

07:10.154 --> 07:15.956
we have gathered here

07:16.157 --> 07:23.321
to perform the Puja to the Sahasrara.

07:28.925 --> 07:32.414
When we enter into the realm of Sahasrara,

07:32.615 --> 07:37.562
then only we have right to do the Sahasrara Puja.

07:37.763 --> 07:42.835
Before this, nobody talked about Sahasrara

07:43.036 --> 07:47.551
nobody did any Puja to Sahasrara.

07:47.752 --> 07:54.380
This is your privilege that you are in the realm of Sahasrara

07:54.581 --> 08:00.448
and that you can do this Puja performed.

08:01.076 --> 08:03.599
It's your right.

08:03.810 --> 08:07.615
You are chosen for this.

08:08.075 --> 08:11.768
It’s a very privileged place for you to enter into

08:11.969 --> 08:14.234
the Sahasrara of the Viraat,

08:14.435 --> 08:21.786
to reside in the brain as cells of that Sahasrara.

08:24.810 --> 08:33.653
Let us see what is the quality of the cells of Sahasrara.

08:43.990 --> 08:49.468
These are specially created cells

08:49.669 --> 08:53.590
through the working of the Swadishthana.

08:53.920 --> 08:57.988
Passing through all the chakras,

08:58.189 --> 09:01.285
when they arrive at Sahasrara

09:01.486 --> 09:09.717
they are equipped to handle the brain's activity

09:09.918 --> 09:18.892
without getting involved into

09:19.093 --> 09:23.633
other elements in the body.

09:27.092 --> 09:33.063
In the same way the Sahaja Yogis

09:33.264 --> 09:40.282
are not to be involved with the other cells -

09:40.483 --> 09:44.484
human beings,

09:44.685 --> 09:49.044
of the body of this universe.

09:53.616 --> 09:57.948
The first thing that happens

09:58.149 --> 10:02.154
to a Sahaja Yogi at the Sahasrara level that

10:02.355 --> 10:07.222
he becomes beyond – ‘ateet’.

10:07.754 --> 10:11.733
So, many things he transcends:

10:11.934 --> 10:15.707
‘kalateet’- he goes beyond time.

10:15.908 --> 10:19.150
Time is his slave.

10:19.908 --> 10:23.264
If you have to go somewhere

10:23.465 --> 10:29.575
then suddenly you discover

10:29.776 --> 10:37.393
that everything is working about the same time

10:37.594 --> 10:41.273
when you are able to do it.

10:41.696 --> 10:50.104
Like you are, say, to catch a train

10:50.305 --> 10:53.972
and you arrive late at the station,

10:54.173 --> 10:58.918
you find the train is late for you.

11:00.853 --> 11:05.902
Things work out in such a way that you feel

11:06.103 --> 11:13.587
they are all acting for your complete convenience.

11:13.788 --> 11:18.295
So you go beyond time - ‘kalateet’.

11:18.581 --> 11:22.473
Then you go beyond dharma - ‘dharmateet’.

11:22.674 --> 11:28.500
Means, dharma becomes part and parcel of your being.

11:28.701 --> 11:31.419
Nobody has to tell you, ‘you do this or you do that’;

11:31.620 --> 11:33.284
you just don't do it.

11:33.485 --> 11:38.502
Whatever you have to do it, you do it.

11:41.670 --> 11:44.299
When you go beyond all these dharmas,

11:44.500 --> 11:47.062
that are the human ‘dharmas’-

11:47.263 --> 11:52.893
human dharma is that his attention gets attracted

11:53.094 --> 12:00.607
either with lust,
greed, at something,

12:00.808 --> 12:04.407
and then he cannot pull out his attention.

12:04.608 --> 12:17.039
But now the attention becomes ‘dharmateet’ -

12:17.240 --> 12:21.958
means the attention loses its dharma.

12:23.260 --> 12:31.165
The dharma of the attention are such that

12:31.366 --> 12:36.839
we have to put

12:37.040 --> 12:42.422
the ‘dharmas’ taught by the prophets to control them.

12:43.673 --> 12:49.438
Because we are coming from the lowest level.

12:49.769 --> 12:56.991
So these dharmas exist in our being and start showing,

12:57.192 --> 13:02.074
and when they attack us,

13:02.275 --> 13:07.677
then

13:07.878 --> 13:13.496
we have to have some measures to control it.

13:13.697 --> 13:18.665
So we build up our dharmas,

13:18.866 --> 13:22.702
our rules and regulation,

13:22.903 --> 13:26.149
and control them, the dharmas,

13:26.350 --> 13:31.217
which have come to us from lower conditioning.

13:31.861 --> 13:35.621
This is the greatness of human beings,

13:35.822 --> 13:42.472
that they have made their own dharmas

13:42.673 --> 13:45.640
established on top of the lower dharmas.

13:45.841 --> 13:50.005
Like carbon has, say, four valences.

13:50.222 --> 13:52.344
It has to be in four valences;

13:52.545 --> 13:55.130
it acts according to the four valences,

13:55.331 --> 13:58.375
it cannot make it six.

13:58.576 --> 14:04.207
But human beings can make

14:04.408 --> 14:07.676
those valences established which are supposed to be

14:07.877 --> 14:12.650
representing the human dharma, the ‘manavdharma’.

14:12.975 --> 14:18.002
But with the Sahasrara ascent the attention loses that quality,

14:18.203 --> 14:21.117
means, you don't have need,

14:21.318 --> 14:24.410
there’s no need,

14:24.611 --> 14:29.050
to put dharmas - restrictions upon yourself.

14:29.251 --> 14:31.378
You don't have to discipline,

14:31.579 --> 14:34.910
but you get disciplined automatically.

14:35.111 --> 14:38.560
That is the first sign of a person

14:38.761 --> 14:44.146
who is belonging to Nirmal Religion. That is pure.

14:44.347 --> 14:47.037
Attention doesn't get attached

14:47.238 --> 14:52.656
or attacked by anything whatsoever, it is so pure.

14:52.857 --> 14:58.458
Like the lotus leaf, the water doesn't stay on it.

15:01.326 --> 15:05.365
So you become ‘kalateet’.

15:05.884 --> 15:07.977
You become ‘dharmateet’.

15:08.178 --> 15:11.256
You become ‘gunateet’.

15:11.662 --> 15:16.191
Means, the three moods in which you are born,

15:16.392 --> 15:20.708
left, right and center, you go beyond them.

15:20.909 --> 15:27.015
The left one is the one by which you have emotional attachments

15:27.216 --> 15:29.872
of your attention.

15:30.073 --> 15:36.558
The second one is the physical and the mental attachments

15:36.759 --> 15:41.743
and the third one, the attachment to the dharma.

15:42.568 --> 15:50.823
Attachment to be righteous and making other righteous;

15:51.024 --> 15:56.150
of disciplining others and disciplining yourself,

15:56.351 --> 15:59.116
which is ‘satvika’.

15:59.434 --> 16:04.336
Where a person tries to control

16:04.537 --> 16:11.339
all his enemies of lust, anger,

16:11.540 --> 16:18.529
pride, vanity, attachments

16:18.730 --> 16:21.511
and greed.

16:22.526 --> 16:29.372
All these restrictions

16:29.573 --> 16:33.484
on the attention get lost

16:33.685 --> 16:40.012
and you become a free person of complete wisdom.

16:40.213 --> 16:45.541
Your attention itself becomes ‘dharmic’.

16:47.883 --> 16:55.472
So, you lose all your ‘gunas’

16:55.673 --> 17:00.124
and you become ‘satgunis’-

17:00.325 --> 17:03.983
means virtuous,

17:04.184 --> 17:10.798
but not by discipline,

17:10.999 --> 17:14.484
but spontaneously.

17:14.685 --> 17:18.061
You become righteous spontaneously.

17:18.262 --> 17:21.652
Sometimes such people puzzle you;

17:21.853 --> 17:26.131
like Christ took a hunter in His hand

17:26.332 --> 17:33.807
and beat people who were selling things in the presence of God,

17:34.008 --> 17:38.070
in the sense, in front of the temples.

17:39.983 --> 17:44.204
According to laws, we should not have temper,

17:44.405 --> 17:50.778
but this temper is a temper of a ‘gunateet’

17:50.979 --> 17:55.198
and such a temper is a spontaneous happening,

17:55.399 --> 18:01.760
which is not to be analyzed,

18:01.961 --> 18:06.536
has to happen. The temper of the Devi on the rakshasas,

18:06.737 --> 18:11.322
the killing of the rakshasas,

18:11.523 --> 18:14.725
Krishna's samharas [MEANS killings],

18:14.926 --> 18:18.894
Krishna telling Arjuna that you have to kill all these people,

18:19.095 --> 18:22.891
they are all dead already.

18:25.259 --> 18:28.976
They all get explained because you go beyond.

18:29.177 --> 18:33.690
So is the 'ateet' beyond conditions arise.

18:33.891 --> 18:37.718
Only the one who can control is beyond.

18:37.919 --> 18:41.794
The one who is in it cannot control it.

18:42.195 --> 18:48.351
If you have to pull out the ship you have to be on the shore.

18:48.552 --> 18:55.205
The one who has gone beyond can only do that.

18:55.406 --> 18:59.296
So you go beyond, that is ‘ateet’.

19:04.563 --> 19:13.632
But, when it comes to the knowledge

19:13.833 --> 19:18.690
about such a person, you cannot think,

19:18.891 --> 19:26.289
because such a person is beyond thinking.

19:26.490 --> 19:29.289
You cannot describe

19:29.490 --> 19:34.169
because such a person cannot describe.

19:34.867 --> 19:40.624
You cannot say, “Why Socrates agreed to

19:40.825 --> 19:45.067
take the poison?

19:48.052 --> 19:52.427
Why Christ agreed to get crucified?”

19:54.395 --> 19:58.879
That's beyond human comprehension.

19:59.871 --> 20:02.826
That's how you behave beyond human comprehension

20:03.027 --> 20:06.896
and you are not to take certificates from human beings.

20:07.097 --> 20:11.563
Your certificates come from God Almighty

20:11.764 --> 20:17.115
and not from these human beings who are at a lower level.

20:17.316 --> 20:23.136
It would be like a dog writing about human beings.

20:30.272 --> 20:32.818
So you reach a state

20:33.019 --> 20:35.933
where it can be described with the word ‘a’,

20:36.134 --> 20:39.235
means ‘without’,

20:42.173 --> 20:44.610
without.

20:47.337 --> 20:52.006
So such a person

20:52.207 --> 20:56.597
is without thought; he doesn't think.

21:03.503 --> 21:07.460
Such a person is without greed,

21:07.661 --> 21:12.973
such a person is without lust - devoid of.

21:17.036 --> 21:21.202
Such a person is said to be ‘ashesh’-

21:21.403 --> 21:30.709
out of which nothing is left out.

21:30.910 --> 21:34.936
Like when you want to make a vacuum,

21:35.137 --> 21:38.877
you go on making the, creating the vacuum,

21:39.078 --> 21:43.679
reach any point and the vacuum cannot be complete

21:43.880 --> 21:47.604
because it reaches a point all the time

21:47.805 --> 21:52.424
where you find some part of it has to be remained.

21:52.625 --> 21:56.328
You cannot have a complete vacuum.

21:56.753 --> 22:02.487
But such a person has a complete vacuum.

22:04.820 --> 22:11.210
Vacuum of all the negative,

22:11.411 --> 22:18.080
aggressive qualities doesn't exist, complete.

22:24.674 --> 22:28.736
Such a person is eternal being.

22:28.956 --> 22:33.536
Nobody can kill,

22:33.737 --> 22:39.611
nobody can harm, nobody can hurt.

22:40.747 --> 22:46.582
The anger

22:46.783 --> 22:52.648
of anyone or respect of anyone does not touch such a person.

22:52.849 --> 22:56.777
He is not disturbed by insults or non-insults.

22:56.978 --> 23:08.870
He is not elated by praises

23:09.071 --> 23:14.915
because he is devoid of the capacity to enjoy

23:15.116 --> 23:19.201
the moods of the ego.

23:31.041 --> 23:37.368
So the third state where he reaches,

23:37.569 --> 23:43.273
he gets the blessing of the word ‘Nih’ –

23:43.474 --> 23:45.359
Nihi.

23:48.207 --> 23:53.482
‘Nihi’ is the first word of My name.

23:53.683 --> 23:59.409
But in Sanskrit, when you combine it with, ‘Mala’,

23:59.610 --> 24:03.297
then it becomes 'Nirmala’.

24:04.226 --> 24:06.906
But the word is 'Nihi'.

24:07.107 --> 24:10.661
‘Ni’ which shakes little.

24:13.589 --> 24:15.779
‘nih’ -

24:15.980 --> 24:22.099
that means

24:22.300 --> 24:24.956
‘sheer’.

24:29.026 --> 24:36.666
Or when a ‘i’ is added to it.

24:39.777 --> 24:46.371
But the first ‘nihi’ means without - devoid

24:46.572 --> 24:53.806
and ‘Nira’ means sheer.

24:59.974 --> 25:07.007
Like when you say

25:07.208 --> 25:15.048
‘nirananda’, ‘niratma’ - sheer ‘atma’,

25:15.249 --> 25:17.663
sheer joy. ‘Kevelam’ -

25:17.864 --> 25:23.153
the only, there’s nothing but joy.

25:25.909 --> 25:29.979
But this word is used,

25:30.180 --> 25:33.322
‘nira’ or ‘nihi’,

25:33.523 --> 25:42.291
used in two forms as I told you. One for say,

25:42.492 --> 25:48.453
without or devoid of.

25:48.654 --> 25:54.163
The another form is:

25:54.364 --> 25:57.809
the only - absolute;

26:01.082 --> 26:03.636
the absolute.

26:05.160 --> 26:10.469
So here the joy becomes ‘nirananda’, absolute joy,

26:10.670 --> 26:13.338
nothing but joy.

26:13.539 --> 26:16.515
It's complete freedom.

26:16.937 --> 26:20.852
So you have all kinds of joys,

26:21.053 --> 26:27.281
as I told you before, you have ‘Swanand’-

26:27.482 --> 26:31.302
the joy of the Spirit.

26:32.755 --> 26:39.473
Then you have got ‘Brahmananda’ - the joy of well-being.

26:40.717 --> 26:43.705
You've got ‘Leelananda’, ‘Krishnananda’-

26:43.906 --> 26:48.679
where you have the joy of the play.

26:52.414 --> 26:55.906
But when you reach the state of Sahasrara

26:56.107 --> 26:58.779
it is ‘Nirananda’ -

26:58.980 --> 27:03.011
means, sheer absolute joy.

27:04.648 --> 27:08.426
Though the name ‘Nira’ is My name,

27:08.627 --> 27:11.905
it means absolute.

27:12.634 --> 27:15.087
So when you put such an adjective before

27:15.288 --> 27:18.978
anything else it becomes absolute.

27:30.402 --> 27:34.081
Thus you become absolute.

27:37.269 --> 27:42.998
And when you are at that state of absolute

27:43.199 --> 27:49.409
then there is no place for anything else to be there but yourself.

27:56.051 --> 28:00.082
But let us see what is absolute.

28:05.507 --> 28:09.587
That means it is not relative;

28:09.788 --> 28:12.142
it has no relative qualities.

28:12.343 --> 28:17.493
Absolute cannot be compared, ‘atulaniya’ -

28:17.694 --> 28:20.404
it cannot be compared.

28:21.594 --> 28:26.258
It cannot be related to anything, it is absolute.

28:29.388 --> 28:32.886
It cannot be comprehended because it cannot be related to

28:33.087 --> 28:36.621
anything else through which we can comprehend;

28:36.822 --> 28:39.501
it is absolute.

28:43.814 --> 28:49.738
Whatever way you try to know it

28:49.939 --> 28:54.149
you go away from absolute.

28:57.572 --> 29:05.057
Whenever you try to analyze the absolute, you are away from it.

29:15.339 --> 29:20.788
So this is what at Sahasrara you get – ‘Niranand’.

29:22.844 --> 29:26.350
In different stages of Sahaja Yoga

29:26.551 --> 29:30.689
we had to start from ‘shariranand’,

29:30.890 --> 29:35.343
means the anand of the body,

29:36.734 --> 29:44.038
‘manasanand’ - the joy of the ‘manasa’- is the psyche.

29:48.088 --> 29:50.868
Then you can say ‘ahamkaranand’,

29:51.069 --> 29:55.459
where you have to have the satisfaction of the ego.

29:57.397 --> 30:00.811
But the state has now

30:01.012 --> 30:04.998
to be established within us is of Niranand.

30:06.271 --> 30:10.724
Then what is the question of fear?

30:13.498 --> 30:16.416
What is the question of talking about it?

30:16.617 --> 30:21.501
You cannot talk, because
how will you relate it?

30:21.702 --> 30:26.186
I cannot say, “It is like this, it is like that”.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.917
There are no words for absolute to describe.

30:31.118 --> 30:33.737
Only by negation, ‘not this, not this, not this’,

30:33.938 --> 30:37.305
what remains is absolute.

30:40.726 --> 30:45.093
So you reach the state of absolute.

30:48.179 --> 30:50.624
And that is the state

30:50.825 --> 30:55.782
a complete communication is established

30:55.983 --> 31:00.719
and in that communication you have nobody else

31:00.920 --> 31:04.193
but the absolute within you.

31:10.961 --> 31:15.007
That is the Sahasrar Puja you are here for.

31:15.874 --> 31:20.381
That is the level to which you should aspire.

31:21.891 --> 31:27.158
That should be the ascent,

31:27.359 --> 31:31.890
which should be established within ourselves.

31:33.007 --> 31:35.441
We don't have to go to Himalayas,

31:35.642 --> 31:39.060
we don't have to do anything drastic.

31:39.261 --> 31:44.722
Remaining in this world we have to become the absolute -

31:44.923 --> 31:48.844
the only, ‘kevalam’.

31:53.645 --> 31:58.934
There is nothing like ‘how?’ for it, you just become.

32:01.197 --> 32:08.095
You just become, like a flowers becomes a fruit.

32:08.296 --> 32:14.288
It's all built in, within you. Allow it to work out.

32:14.901 --> 32:19.627
Just by surrendering you become.

32:21.189 --> 32:25.129
Surrender it and you'll be surprised

32:25.330 --> 32:32.494
you will be at the state where you will enjoy your absoluteness.

32:33.775 --> 32:37.184
It is absolute love,

32:37.385 --> 32:40.885
it is absolute compassion;

32:41.086 --> 32:44.916
it is absolute power.

32:58.034 --> 33:00.340
The words stop,

33:00.541 --> 33:04.916
the description stops.

33:06.854 --> 33:09.904
You just become the absolute

33:10.105 --> 33:16.951
and feel your absoluteness through it

33:17.152 --> 33:20.542
with that oneness.

33:22.441 --> 33:27.448
If somebody is not with you, you don't worry.

33:29.074 --> 33:32.217
There’s no company needed.

33:32.418 --> 33:38.621
You're alone, enjoying the absolute.

33:44.549 --> 33:51.093
There only you can enjoy the absolute in others also,

33:51.294 --> 33:57.629
in the best form without seeing anything else but the absolute.

34:02.927 --> 34:06.326
May God bless you.
