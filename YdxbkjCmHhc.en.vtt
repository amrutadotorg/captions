00:06:56.933 --> 00:07:09.953
Today in this beautiful place created by the queen of Austria,

00:07:10.154 --> 00:07:15.956
we have gathered here

00:07:16.157 --> 00:07:23.321
to perform the Puja to the Sahasrara.

00:07:28.925 --> 00:07:32.414
When we enter into the realm of Sahasrara,

00:07:32.615 --> 00:07:37.562
then only we have right to do the Sahasrara Puja.

00:07:37.763 --> 00:07:42.835
Before this, nobody talked about Sahasrara

00:07:43.036 --> 00:07:47.551
nobody did any Puja to Sahasrara.

00:07:47.752 --> 00:07:54.380
This is your privilege that you are in the realm of Sahasrara

00:07:54.581 --> 00:08:00.448
and that you can do this Puja performed.

00:08:01.076 --> 00:08:03.599
It's your right.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:07.615
You are chosen for this.

00:08:08.075 --> 00:08:11.768
It’s a very privileged place for you to enter into

00:08:11.969 --> 00:08:14.234
the Sahasrara of the Viraat,

00:08:14.435 --> 00:08:21.786
to reside in the brain as cells of that Sahasrara.

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:33.653
Let us see what is the quality of the cells of Sahasrara.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:49.468
These are specially created cells

00:08:49.669 --> 00:08:53.590
through the working of the Swadishthana.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.988
Passing through all the chakras,

00:08:58.189 --> 00:09:01.285
when they arrive at Sahasrara

00:09:01.486 --> 00:09:09.717
they are equipped to handle the brain's activity

00:09:09.918 --> 00:09:18.892
without getting involved into

00:09:19.093 --> 00:09:23.633
other elements in the body.

00:09:27.092 --> 00:09:33.063
In the same way the Sahaja Yogis

00:09:33.264 --> 00:09:40.282
are not to be involved with the other cells -

00:09:40.483 --> 00:09:44.484
human beings,

00:09:44.685 --> 00:09:49.044
of the body of this universe.

00:09:53.616 --> 00:09:57.948
The first thing that happens

00:09:58.149 --> 00:10:02.154
to a Sahaja Yogi at the Sahasrara level that

00:10:02.355 --> 00:10:07.222
he becomes beyond – ‘ateet’.

00:10:07.754 --> 00:10:11.733
So, many things he transcends:

00:10:11.934 --> 00:10:15.707
‘kalateet’- he goes beyond time.

00:10:15.908 --> 00:10:19.150
Time is his slave.

00:10:19.908 --> 00:10:23.264
If you have to go somewhere

00:10:23.465 --> 00:10:29.575
then suddenly you discover

00:10:29.776 --> 00:10:37.393
that everything is working about the same time

00:10:37.594 --> 00:10:41.273
when you are able to do it.

00:10:41.696 --> 00:10:50.104
Like you are, say, to catch a train

00:10:50.305 --> 00:10:53.972
and you arrive late at the station,

00:10:54.173 --> 00:10:58.918
you find the train is late for you.

00:11:00.853 --> 00:11:05.902
Things work out in such a way that you feel

00:11:06.103 --> 00:11:13.587
they are all acting for your complete convenience.

00:11:13.788 --> 00:11:18.295
So you go beyond time - ‘kalateet’.

00:11:18.581 --> 00:11:22.473
Then you go beyond dharma - ‘dharmateet’.

00:11:22.674 --> 00:11:28.500
Means, dharma becomes part and parcel of your being.

00:11:28.701 --> 00:11:31.419
Nobody has to tell you, ‘you do this or you do that’;

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.284
you just don't do it.

00:11:33.485 --> 00:11:38.502
Whatever you have to do it, you do it.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:44.299
When you go beyond all these dharmas,

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.062
that are the human ‘dharmas’-

00:11:47.263 --> 00:11:52.893
human dharma is that his attention gets attracted

00:11:53.094 --> 00:12:00.607
either with lust,
greed, at something,

00:12:00.808 --> 00:12:04.407
and then he cannot pull out his attention.

00:12:04.608 --> 00:12:17.039
But now the attention becomes ‘dharmateet’ -

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:21.958
means the attention loses its dharma.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:31.165
The dharma of the attention are such that

00:12:31.366 --> 00:12:36.839
we have to put

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:42.422
the ‘dharmas’ taught by the prophets to control them.

00:12:43.673 --> 00:12:49.438
Because we are coming from the lowest level.

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:56.991
So these dharmas exist in our being and start showing,

00:12:57.192 --> 00:13:02.074
and when they attack us,

00:13:02.275 --> 00:13:07.677
then

00:13:07.878 --> 00:13:13.496
we have to have some measures to control it.

00:13:13.697 --> 00:13:18.665
So we build up our dharmas,

00:13:18.866 --> 00:13:22.702
our rules and regulation,

00:13:22.903 --> 00:13:26.149
and control them, the dharmas,

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:31.217
which have come to us from lower conditioning.

00:13:31.861 --> 00:13:35.621
This is the greatness of human beings,

00:13:35.822 --> 00:13:42.472
that they have made their own dharmas

00:13:42.673 --> 00:13:45.640
established on top of the lower dharmas.

00:13:45.841 --> 00:13:50.005
Like carbon has, say, four valences.

00:13:50.222 --> 00:13:52.344
It has to be in four valences;

00:13:52.545 --> 00:13:55.130
it acts according to the four valences,

00:13:55.331 --> 00:13:58.375
it cannot make it six.

00:13:58.576 --> 00:14:04.207
But human beings can make

00:14:04.408 --> 00:14:07.676
those valences established which are supposed to be

00:14:07.877 --> 00:14:12.650
representing the human dharma, the ‘manavdharma’.

00:14:12.975 --> 00:14:18.002
But with the Sahasrara ascent the attention loses that quality,

00:14:18.203 --> 00:14:21.117
means, you don't have need,

00:14:21.318 --> 00:14:24.410
there’s no need,

00:14:24.611 --> 00:14:29.050
to put dharmas - restrictions upon yourself.

00:14:29.251 --> 00:14:31.378
You don't have to discipline,

00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:34.910
but you get disciplined automatically.

00:14:35.111 --> 00:14:38.560
That is the first sign of a person

00:14:38.761 --> 00:14:44.146
who is belonging to Nirmal Religion. That is pure.

00:14:44.347 --> 00:14:47.037
Attention doesn't get attached

00:14:47.238 --> 00:14:52.656
or attacked by anything whatsoever, it is so pure.

00:14:52.857 --> 00:14:58.458
Like the lotus leaf, the water doesn't stay on it.

00:15:01.326 --> 00:15:05.365
So you become ‘kalateet’.

00:15:05.884 --> 00:15:07.977
You become ‘dharmateet’.

00:15:08.178 --> 00:15:11.256
You become ‘gunateet’.

00:15:11.662 --> 00:15:16.191
Means, the three moods in which you are born,

00:15:16.392 --> 00:15:20.708
left, right and center, you go beyond them.

00:15:20.909 --> 00:15:27.015
The left one is the one by which you have emotional attachments

00:15:27.216 --> 00:15:29.872
of your attention.

00:15:30.073 --> 00:15:36.558
The second one is the physical and the mental attachments

00:15:36.759 --> 00:15:41.743
and the third one, the attachment to the dharma.

00:15:42.568 --> 00:15:50.823
Attachment to be righteous and making other righteous;

00:15:51.024 --> 00:15:56.150
of disciplining others and disciplining yourself,

00:15:56.351 --> 00:15:59.116
which is ‘satvika’.

00:15:59.434 --> 00:16:04.336
Where a person tries to control

00:16:04.537 --> 00:16:11.339
all his enemies of lust, anger,

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:18.529
pride, vanity, attachments

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:21.511
and greed.

00:16:22.526 --> 00:16:29.372
All these restrictions

00:16:29.573 --> 00:16:33.484
on the attention get lost

00:16:33.685 --> 00:16:40.012
and you become a free person of complete wisdom.

00:16:40.213 --> 00:16:45.541
Your attention itself becomes ‘dharmic’.

00:16:47.883 --> 00:16:55.472
So, you lose all your ‘gunas’

00:16:55.673 --> 00:17:00.124
and you become ‘satgunis’-

00:17:00.325 --> 00:17:03.983
means virtuous,

00:17:04.184 --> 00:17:10.798
but not by discipline,

00:17:10.999 --> 00:17:14.484
but spontaneously.

00:17:14.685 --> 00:17:18.061
You become righteous spontaneously.

00:17:18.262 --> 00:17:21.652
Sometimes such people puzzle you;

00:17:21.853 --> 00:17:26.131
like Christ took a hunter in His hand

00:17:26.332 --> 00:17:33.807
and beat people who were selling things in the presence of God,

00:17:34.008 --> 00:17:38.070
in the sense, in front of the temples.

00:17:39.983 --> 00:17:44.204
According to laws, we should not have temper,

00:17:44.405 --> 00:17:50.778
but this temper is a temper of a ‘gunateet’

00:17:50.979 --> 00:17:55.198
and such a temper is a spontaneous happening,

00:17:55.399 --> 00:18:01.760
which is not to be analyzed,

00:18:01.961 --> 00:18:06.536
has to happen. The temper of the Devi on the rakshasas,

00:18:06.737 --> 00:18:11.322
the killing of the rakshasas,

00:18:11.523 --> 00:18:14.725
Krishna's samharas [MEANS killings],

00:18:14.926 --> 00:18:18.894
Krishna telling Arjuna that you have to kill all these people,

00:18:19.095 --> 00:18:22.891
they are all dead already.

00:18:25.259 --> 00:18:28.976
They all get explained because you go beyond.

00:18:29.177 --> 00:18:33.690
So is the 'ateet' beyond conditions arise.

00:18:33.891 --> 00:18:37.718
Only the one who can control is beyond.

00:18:37.919 --> 00:18:41.794
The one who is in it cannot control it.

00:18:42.195 --> 00:18:48.351
If you have to pull out the ship you have to be on the shore.

00:18:48.552 --> 00:18:55.205
The one who has gone beyond can only do that.

00:18:55.406 --> 00:18:59.296
So you go beyond, that is ‘ateet’.

00:19:04.563 --> 00:19:13.632
But, when it comes to the knowledge

00:19:13.833 --> 00:19:18.690
about such a person, you cannot think,

00:19:18.891 --> 00:19:26.289
because such a person is beyond thinking.

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:29.289
You cannot describe

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:34.169
because such a person cannot describe.

00:19:34.867 --> 00:19:40.624
You cannot say, “Why Socrates agreed to

00:19:40.825 --> 00:19:45.067
take the poison?

00:19:48.052 --> 00:19:52.427
Why Christ agreed to get crucified?”

00:19:54.395 --> 00:19:58.879
That's beyond human comprehension.

00:19:59.871 --> 00:20:02.826
That's how you behave beyond human comprehension

00:20:03.027 --> 00:20:06.896
and you are not to take certificates from human beings.

00:20:07.097 --> 00:20:11.563
Your certificates come from God Almighty

00:20:11.764 --> 00:20:17.115
and not from these human beings who are at a lower level.

00:20:17.316 --> 00:20:23.136
It would be like a dog writing about human beings.

00:20:30.272 --> 00:20:32.818
So you reach a state

00:20:33.019 --> 00:20:35.933
where it can be described with the word ‘a’,

00:20:36.134 --> 00:20:39.235
means ‘without’,

00:20:42.173 --> 00:20:44.610
without.

00:20:47.337 --> 00:20:52.006
So such a person

00:20:52.207 --> 00:20:56.597
is without thought; he doesn't think.

00:21:03.503 --> 00:21:07.460
Such a person is without greed,

00:21:07.661 --> 00:21:12.973
such a person is without lust - devoid of.

00:21:17.036 --> 00:21:21.202
Such a person is said to be ‘ashesh’-

00:21:21.403 --> 00:21:30.709
out of which nothing is left out.

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:34.936
Like when you want to make a vacuum,

00:21:35.137 --> 00:21:38.877
you go on making the, creating the vacuum,

00:21:39.078 --> 00:21:43.679
reach any point and the vacuum cannot be complete

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:47.604
because it reaches a point all the time

00:21:47.805 --> 00:21:52.424
where you find some part of it has to be remained.

00:21:52.625 --> 00:21:56.328
You cannot have a complete vacuum.

00:21:56.753 --> 00:22:02.487
But such a person has a complete vacuum.

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:11.210
Vacuum of all the negative,

00:22:11.411 --> 00:22:18.080
aggressive qualities doesn't exist, complete.

00:22:24.674 --> 00:22:28.736
Such a person is eternal being.

00:22:28.956 --> 00:22:33.536
Nobody can kill,

00:22:33.737 --> 00:22:39.611
nobody can harm, nobody can hurt.

00:22:40.747 --> 00:22:46.582
The anger

00:22:46.783 --> 00:22:52.648
of anyone or respect of anyone does not touch such a person.

00:22:52.849 --> 00:22:56.777
He is not disturbed by insults or non-insults.

00:22:56.978 --> 00:23:08.870
He is not elated by praises

00:23:09.071 --> 00:23:14.915
because he is devoid of the capacity to enjoy

00:23:15.116 --> 00:23:19.201
the moods of the ego.

00:23:31.041 --> 00:23:37.368
So the third state where he reaches,

00:23:37.569 --> 00:23:43.273
he gets the blessing of the word ‘Nih’ –

00:23:43.474 --> 00:23:45.359
Nihi.

00:23:48.207 --> 00:23:53.482
‘Nihi’ is the first word of My name.

00:23:53.683 --> 00:23:59.409
But in Sanskrit, when you combine it with, ‘Mala’,

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:03.297
then it becomes 'Nirmala’.

00:24:04.226 --> 00:24:06.906
But the word is 'Nihi'.

00:24:07.107 --> 00:24:10.661
‘Ni’ which shakes little.

00:24:13.589 --> 00:24:15.779
‘nih’ -

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:22.099
that means

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.956
‘sheer’.

00:24:29.026 --> 00:24:36.666
Or when a ‘i’ is added to it.

00:24:39.777 --> 00:24:46.371
But the first ‘nihi’ means without - devoid

00:24:46.572 --> 00:24:53.806
and ‘Nira’ means sheer.

00:24:59.974 --> 00:25:07.007
Like when you say

00:25:07.208 --> 00:25:15.048
‘nirananda’, ‘niratma’ - sheer ‘atma’,

00:25:15.249 --> 00:25:17.663
sheer joy. ‘Kevelam’ -

00:25:17.864 --> 00:25:23.153
the only, there’s nothing but joy.

00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:29.979
But this word is used,

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:33.322
‘nira’ or ‘nihi’,

00:25:33.523 --> 00:25:42.291
used in two forms as I told you. One for say,

00:25:42.492 --> 00:25:48.453
without or devoid of.

00:25:48.654 --> 00:25:54.163
The another form is:

00:25:54.364 --> 00:25:57.809
the only - absolute;

00:26:01.082 --> 00:26:03.636
the absolute.

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:10.469
So here the joy becomes ‘nirananda’, absolute joy,

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:13.338
nothing but joy.

00:26:13.539 --> 00:26:16.515
It's complete freedom.

00:26:16.937 --> 00:26:20.852
So you have all kinds of joys,

00:26:21.053 --> 00:26:27.281
as I told you before, you have ‘Swanand’-

00:26:27.482 --> 00:26:31.302
the joy of the Spirit.

00:26:32.755 --> 00:26:39.473
Then you have got ‘Brahmananda’ - the joy of well-being.

00:26:40.717 --> 00:26:43.705
You've got ‘Leelananda’, ‘Krishnananda’-

00:26:43.906 --> 00:26:48.679
where you have the joy of the play.

00:26:52.414 --> 00:26:55.906
But when you reach the state of Sahasrara

00:26:56.107 --> 00:26:58.779
it is ‘Nirananda’ -

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:03.011
means, sheer absolute joy.

00:27:04.648 --> 00:27:08.426
Though the name ‘Nira’ is My name,

00:27:08.627 --> 00:27:11.905
it means absolute.

00:27:12.634 --> 00:27:15.087
So when you put such an adjective before

00:27:15.288 --> 00:27:18.978
anything else it becomes absolute.

00:27:30.402 --> 00:27:34.081
Thus you become absolute.

00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:42.998
And when you are at that state of absolute

00:27:43.199 --> 00:27:49.409
then there is no place for anything else to be there but yourself.

00:27:56.051 --> 00:28:00.082
But let us see what is absolute.

00:28:05.507 --> 00:28:09.587
That means it is not relative;

00:28:09.788 --> 00:28:12.142
it has no relative qualities.

00:28:12.343 --> 00:28:17.493
Absolute cannot be compared, ‘atulaniya’ -

00:28:17.694 --> 00:28:20.404
it cannot be compared.

00:28:21.594 --> 00:28:26.258
It cannot be related to anything, it is absolute.

00:28:29.388 --> 00:28:32.886
It cannot be comprehended because it cannot be related to

00:28:33.087 --> 00:28:36.621
anything else through which we can comprehend;

00:28:36.822 --> 00:28:39.501
it is absolute.

00:28:43.814 --> 00:28:49.738
Whatever way you try to know it

00:28:49.939 --> 00:28:54.149
you go away from absolute.

00:28:57.572 --> 00:29:05.057
Whenever you try to analyze the absolute, you are away from it.

00:29:15.339 --> 00:29:20.788
So this is what at Sahasrara you get – ‘Niranand’.

00:29:22.844 --> 00:29:26.350
In different stages of Sahaja Yoga

00:29:26.551 --> 00:29:30.689
we had to start from ‘shariranand’,

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:35.343
means the anand of the body,

00:29:36.734 --> 00:29:44.038
‘manasanand’ - the joy of the ‘manasa’- is the psyche.

00:29:48.088 --> 00:29:50.868
Then you can say ‘ahamkaranand’,

00:29:51.069 --> 00:29:55.459
where you have to have the satisfaction of the ego.

00:29:57.397 --> 00:30:00.811
But the state has now

00:30:01.012 --> 00:30:04.998
to be established within us is of Niranand.

00:30:06.271 --> 00:30:10.724
Then what is the question of fear?

00:30:13.498 --> 00:30:16.416
What is the question of talking about it?

00:30:16.617 --> 00:30:21.501
You cannot talk, because
how will you relate it?

00:30:21.702 --> 00:30:26.186
I cannot say, “It is like this, it is like that”.

00:30:27.826 --> 00:30:30.917
There are no words for absolute to describe.

00:30:31.118 --> 00:30:33.737
Only by negation, ‘not this, not this, not this’,

00:30:33.938 --> 00:30:37.305
what remains is absolute.

00:30:40.726 --> 00:30:45.093
So you reach the state of absolute.

00:30:48.179 --> 00:30:50.624
And that is the state

00:30:50.825 --> 00:30:55.782
a complete communication is established

00:30:55.983 --> 00:31:00.719
and in that communication you have nobody else

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:04.193
but the absolute within you.

00:31:10.961 --> 00:31:15.007
That is the Sahasrar Puja you are here for.

00:31:15.874 --> 00:31:20.381
That is the level to which you should aspire.

00:31:21.891 --> 00:31:27.158
That should be the ascent,

00:31:27.359 --> 00:31:31.890
which should be established within ourselves.

00:31:33.007 --> 00:31:35.441
We don't have to go to Himalayas,

00:31:35.642 --> 00:31:39.060
we don't have to do anything drastic.

00:31:39.261 --> 00:31:44.722
Remaining in this world we have to become the absolute -

00:31:44.923 --> 00:31:48.844
the only, ‘kevalam’.

00:31:53.645 --> 00:31:58.934
There is nothing like ‘how?’ for it, you just become.

00:32:01.197 --> 00:32:08.095
You just become, like a flowers becomes a fruit.

00:32:08.296 --> 00:32:14.288
It's all built in, within you. Allow it to work out.

00:32:14.901 --> 00:32:19.627
Just by surrendering you become.

00:32:21.189 --> 00:32:25.129
Surrender it and you'll be surprised

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:32.494
you will be at the state where you will enjoy your absoluteness.

00:32:33.775 --> 00:32:37.184
It is absolute love,

00:32:37.385 --> 00:32:40.885
it is absolute compassion;

00:32:41.086 --> 00:32:44.916
it is absolute power.

00:32:58.034 --> 00:33:00.340
The words stop,

00:33:00.541 --> 00:33:04.916
the description stops.

00:33:06.854 --> 00:33:09.904
You just become the absolute

00:33:10.105 --> 00:33:16.951
and feel your absoluteness through it

00:33:17.152 --> 00:33:20.542
with that oneness.

00:33:22.441 --> 00:33:27.448
If somebody is not with you, you don't worry.

00:33:29.074 --> 00:33:32.217
There’s no company needed.

00:33:32.418 --> 00:33:38.621
You're alone, enjoying the absolute.

00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:51.093
There only you can enjoy the absolute in others also,

00:33:51.294 --> 00:33:57.629
in the best form without seeing anything else but the absolute.

00:34:02.927 --> 00:34:06.326
May God bless you.
