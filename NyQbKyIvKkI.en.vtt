00:03.949 --> 00:07.690
For ascent it’s not a mental procedure,

00:07.690 --> 00:17.260
it’s a procedure of the heart which is thanksgiving.

00:17.260 --> 00:22.000
Look at the flowers,

00:22.000 --> 00:25.080
they are
giving thanks to God.

00:25.080 --> 00:29.280
The whole being is nothing but thanksgiving!

00:29.280 --> 00:34.960
Not worried, they are being plucked, they
will die tomorrow – not worried.

00:34.960 --> 00:38.540
As long as they live it’s giving thanks.

00:38.540 --> 00:44.100
Look at everything, look at this candle, what
is it?

00:44.100 --> 00:48.060
Is thanksgiving.

00:48.070 --> 00:55.230
Everything that is created is giving thanks.

00:55.230 --> 01:00.420
What about us human beings?

01:00.420 --> 01:10.980
We say, because we can say it, they cannot
say.

01:10.980 --> 01:15.820
It doesn’t have words to say.

01:15.829 --> 01:21.639
We have language, that’s how we have become
superficial,

01:21.639 --> 01:26.639
we have lost our depth because we have language.

01:26.640 --> 01:34.960
There is no language for the silent expression.
