00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.154
Today is a unique combination

00:00:07.487 --> 00:00:11.237
of Mother's Day in many countries,

00:00:11.612 --> 00:00:16.903
and Sahasrara Day for Sahaja yogis.

00:00:20.945 --> 00:00:24.945
I think this is the most important day

00:00:25.654 --> 00:00:30.736
in the history of human evolution,

00:00:32.404 --> 00:00:37.736
because all other events, incarnations

00:00:39.404 --> 00:00:44.737
and ventures in the spiritual atmosphere

00:00:46.195 --> 00:00:48.945
have been of no avail.

00:00:49.404 --> 00:00:52.529
On the contrary, they have gone

00:00:52.945 --> 00:00:57.237
into a kind of a cocoon

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.446
which has no door,

00:01:00.903 --> 00:01:04.737
banging themselves against the walls,

00:01:05.778 --> 00:01:12.195
creating problems out of something very auspicious

00:01:12.612 --> 00:01:16.237
and extremely,

00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:20.778
beautifully spiritual.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.154
It's not possible to find faults

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:29.862
with the incarnations in whose names

00:01:30.195 --> 00:01:33.028
all the religions came in.

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:38.112
But this cocoon is the Mahamaya, I think.

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:42.279
Cocoon is the one which is ignorance.

00:01:44.862 --> 00:01:47.028
We can say that

00:01:47.446 --> 00:01:51.070
Maya, Mahamaya does not create it.

00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:53.362
This cocoon is created

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:57.237
by the basic ignorance of human beings

00:01:58.903 --> 00:02:02.362
and their misidentifications.

00:02:03.195 --> 00:02:06.862
So the human nature is such

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:13.195
that it identifies itself easily with untruth.

00:02:15.487 --> 00:02:18.028
Anything that is truthful,

00:02:18.696 --> 00:02:22.571
human beings find it very difficult to compromise.

00:02:23.112 --> 00:02:24.987
The trouble with the truth is

00:02:25.362 --> 00:02:27.736
that it cannot compromise.

00:02:28.571 --> 00:02:31.820
So all kinds of ignorance,

00:02:32.362 --> 00:02:34.696
all kinds of falsehood,

00:02:35.404 --> 00:02:38.070
all kinds of destructive forces

00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:40.487
gather together

00:02:40.903 --> 00:02:45.404
somehow or other, to attract human mind.

00:02:46.778 --> 00:02:50.195
It is perhaps the ego of man

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:53.736
that makes him feel so attractive to those things,

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.529
because they all pamper his ego.

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:02.945
As it is, the most difficult center

00:03:03.487 --> 00:03:09.654
that we have to cross is this center of Agnya.

00:03:10.862 --> 00:03:15.487
This center is the one which takes us out to either

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.612
to the left or to the right, if you try to push it too much.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.778
Thus we land up into the

00:03:29.571 --> 00:03:32.945
hold of ignorance,

00:03:33.487 --> 00:03:37.903
which is being looked after by Mahamaya.

00:03:39.362 --> 00:03:41.737
They say that at Sahasrara

00:03:42.237 --> 00:03:47.112
when the Goddess will appear, She will be a Mahamaya.

00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:55.945
Is it possible to be anything else as the world is today,

00:03:56.487 --> 00:03:59.446
to come on this Earth?

00:03:59.945 --> 00:04:04.320
Any other type of incarnation

00:04:04.778 --> 00:04:08.028
would have been in great trouble,

00:04:09.154 --> 00:04:11.654
because human beings in their ego

00:04:12.028 --> 00:04:16.237
are the highest in Kali Yuga, highest.

00:04:17.945 --> 00:04:20.195
So they are quite stupid

00:04:20.696 --> 00:04:24.028
and they are capable of doing any harm,

00:04:24.404 --> 00:04:27.654
any kind of harm, any kind of violence,

00:04:28.112 --> 00:04:31.487
to a divine personality.

00:04:31.987 --> 00:04:35.737
It is not at all possible

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.571
to exist in this world

00:04:41.446 --> 00:04:44.654
as anything else but Mahamaya.

00:04:46.154 --> 00:04:50.612
But it also acts upon the people who are seeking.

00:04:51.736 --> 00:04:54.237
It has many facets.

00:04:54.736 --> 00:05:01.279
By one facet it covers your Sahasrara:

00:05:04.237 --> 00:05:08.529
the seekers are tested.

00:05:11.195 --> 00:05:14.696
If you are more enamored by people

00:05:16.237 --> 00:05:21.654
who are something odd, who wear odd dresses,

00:05:22.237 --> 00:05:24.571
who show odd things

00:05:25.571 --> 00:05:29.903
as so many false gurus have done,

00:05:30.778 --> 00:05:35.446
or absurd or something very cheapish,

00:05:36.154 --> 00:05:40.487
that attracts the attention of human beings

00:05:40.862 --> 00:05:42.945
because of Mahamaya,

00:05:43.362 --> 00:05:47.820
or we can say that it is the Mahamaya which judges a person.

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:52.987
Mahamaya is like a mirror.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.612
Whatever you are, you see yourself in the mirror.

00:05:59.112 --> 00:06:01.362
Mirror has no responsibility.

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:05.112
If you look like a monkey, you look like a monkey.

00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:08.487
If you look like a queen, you look like a queen.

00:06:08.903 --> 00:06:13.862
It has no power or no intention

00:06:14.612 --> 00:06:17.028
of giving you wrong ideas,

00:06:17.404 --> 00:06:21.487
or giving you something that is false.

00:06:21.987 --> 00:06:25.404
It is there, whatever is the truth.

00:06:25.945 --> 00:06:28.529
So in a way to say that Mahamaya is the one

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.737
which deludes us, is wrong.

00:06:32.654 --> 00:06:36.654
On the contrary, when you look at the mirror

00:06:37.654 --> 00:06:41.028
you see yourself as what you are.

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:48.320
Now supposing you are a person who is, say,

00:06:49.362 --> 00:06:51.736
a very cruel person,

00:06:52.487 --> 00:06:55.903
your face in the mirror will look like a cruel person.

00:06:56.696 --> 00:07:01.612
But the problem comes in when the Mahamaya acts,

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:05.612
you don't see your image.

00:07:07.028 --> 00:07:10.112
You turn your face away from it,

00:07:10.736 --> 00:07:13.404
don't want to see, don't want to know.

00:07:13.862 --> 00:07:17.362
You look at the mirror, you see something horrible,

00:07:17.736 --> 00:07:22.862
you just turn face and you deny the truth,

00:07:23.945 --> 00:07:25.903
"How can I be like that? I'm not like that.

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:28.320
I'm very good, nothing wrong with me.

00:07:28.696 --> 00:07:32.820
I've done nothing wrong. I'm perfectly all right."

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.446
Then the third aspect of Mahamaya is

00:07:38.778 --> 00:07:41.696
that you are again attracted towards it,

00:07:42.028 --> 00:07:44.529
in a sense that you again see your mirror.

00:07:44.862 --> 00:07:47.320
You go on seeing that mirror again and again,

00:07:47.696 --> 00:07:50.987
and you see the whole world also in that mirror.

00:07:51.529 --> 00:07:56.820
As a result, you start getting a feeling,

00:07:57.487 --> 00:08:00.028
"What am I doing?

00:08:00.487 --> 00:08:04.320
Who am I?

00:08:05.362 --> 00:08:08.195
What is this world?

00:08:08.696 --> 00:08:11.737
Where am I born?"

00:08:12.195 --> 00:08:16.404
And this is the beginning of your search.

00:08:16.903 --> 00:08:20.028
You don't feel satisfied with it,

00:08:20.696 --> 00:08:25.987
so it is a very great help of the Mahamaya.

00:08:27.571 --> 00:08:30.820
I have seen people who come to Me

00:08:37.736 --> 00:08:39.862
for the first time,

00:08:40.028 --> 00:08:43.487
and if they see Me taking water like this say,

00:08:43.778 --> 00:08:48.945
"Ah, how can She be something? She just needs water!"

00:08:50.112 --> 00:08:53.654
Or if I am taking, say,

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:56.737
Coca Cola as you all take,

00:08:57.237 --> 00:09:00.320
they'll say, "Wah, how can She take Coca Cola?

00:09:00.736 --> 00:09:02.404
She should never take anything like that,

00:09:02.696 --> 00:09:05.987
She should only take nectar."

00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:17.112
So the another aspect of Mahamaya is,

00:09:17.446 --> 00:09:19.820
say people come to see Me,

00:09:20.195 --> 00:09:22.903
some of them start shaking like this,

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:25.279
so they think, "Oh, we are great energy,

00:09:25.571 --> 00:09:28.195
that's why it's happening to us."

00:09:28.654 --> 00:09:30.987
It has happened with many people.

00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:32.987
So they get wrong impressions

00:09:33.362 --> 00:09:37.362
because of their own reactions to it.

00:09:37.945 --> 00:09:40.612
Their reaction is, "Wow, we went there, got all the energy,

00:09:40.903 --> 00:09:45.320
we were shaking, shaking, shaking, so we are something great."

00:09:46.654 --> 00:09:51.279
This kind of a happening

00:09:51.945 --> 00:09:56.820
makes them more egoistical,

00:09:58.654 --> 00:10:02.571
but on the contrary if they see somebody else shaking

00:10:03.112 --> 00:10:07.237
- it has happened - and ask them "who you are?"

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.320
So they'll say, "We are certified mad from such hospital."

00:10:12.903 --> 00:10:14.736
Then they will start relatively thinking,

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:17.737
"Oh, God, we are also mad or what?

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:20.529
Why are we shaking? We should not shake.

00:10:20.945 --> 00:10:24.612
If they are certified mad and they are shaking

00:10:24.903 --> 00:10:26.112
and we are shaking ..."

00:10:26.446 --> 00:10:30.320
then they start relatively seeing things.

00:10:31.446 --> 00:10:35.987
On one side there's a mad, certified mad shaking,

00:10:36.487 --> 00:10:38.862
another side you are shaking,

00:10:39.404 --> 00:10:44.112
so there's something wrong definitely with you also.

00:10:44.903 --> 00:10:49.529
So the relative understanding helps

00:10:50.028 --> 00:10:54.404
to overcome that kind of a curtain that you have,

00:10:54.737 --> 00:10:58.112
that you do not want to face the truth.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:05.028
So, once it starts happening to you relatively

00:11:05.362 --> 00:11:08.320
you'll see compared to other people.

00:11:09.112 --> 00:11:11.446
Yesterday, as you saw in the drama,

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.154
compared to other people we are a really sane,

00:11:14.612 --> 00:11:19.028
wise, sensible, matured people.

00:11:19.736 --> 00:11:23.737
Once you see that relative ascent,

00:11:24.279 --> 00:11:28.237
then you start settling in Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:31.571 --> 00:11:34.654
Mahamaya is very important.

00:11:35.737 --> 00:11:38.612
Without that you cannot face Me, you cannot sit here,

00:11:38.903 --> 00:11:39.862
you cannot talk to Me,

00:11:40.195 --> 00:11:42.736
you cannot get into the same car which is driving Me,

00:11:43.112 --> 00:11:45.696
and also you cannot drive Me.

00:11:46.903 --> 00:11:48.612
Everything would be impossible.

00:11:48.903 --> 00:11:50.571
I would be hanging in the air somewhere,

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:54.903
you'll be all there and it would be a big mess.

00:11:57.737 --> 00:12:00.112
I wouldn't be, I don't need to travel by train,

00:12:00.529 --> 00:12:01.987
I don't need to travel by car,

00:12:02.404 --> 00:12:05.487
I can just fly out - what's this?

00:12:06.279 --> 00:12:11.154
I need not before you, I can be just here in nirakara,

00:12:11.529 --> 00:12:14.279
in formless form,

00:12:14.987 --> 00:12:18.237
but how to communicate?

00:12:18.903 --> 00:12:21.696
How to have a rapport?

00:12:22.529 --> 00:12:28.320
For that, one has to come in the form of Mahamaya

00:12:28.862 --> 00:12:32.945
so that there's no fear, there's no distance,

00:12:33.446 --> 00:12:37.487
and one can come close and understand;

00:12:37.862 --> 00:12:40.778
because if this knowledge has to be given,

00:12:41.154 --> 00:12:43.987
if realization has to be given,

00:12:44.362 --> 00:12:48.112
people have to at least sit before the Mahamaya.

00:12:48.654 --> 00:12:52.736
Otherwise if they all run away, what's the use?

00:12:55.446 --> 00:12:58.945
So the create that human,

00:12:59.446 --> 00:13:04.404
extremely human personality in the Sahasrara,

00:13:04.737 --> 00:13:07.903
She comes as Mahamaya.

00:13:08.404 --> 00:13:11.903
Sahasrara is the most powerful chakra

00:13:12.237 --> 00:13:15.529
because it is the seven chakras

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.195
combination and many others.

00:13:18.696 --> 00:13:22.195
With the Sahasrara you can do anything.

00:13:22.696 --> 00:13:25.112
You can manage the sun, you can manage the moon,

00:13:25.446 --> 00:13:26.654
you can manage the earth,

00:13:26.903 --> 00:13:30.696
you can manage the temperatures, everything.

00:13:32.778 --> 00:13:37.696
But through Mahamaya things work out very normally,

00:13:38.112 --> 00:13:41.778
very normally, and they should work out normally.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.736
For example, somebody can say,

00:13:44.028 --> 00:13:46.154
"Mother, there is atmosphere full of

00:13:46.571 --> 00:13:50.820
all these horrible ecological problems.

00:13:51.362 --> 00:13:54.070
Why don't You clear them?"

00:13:57.736 --> 00:14:02.612
If it is cleared, people will go on producing.

00:14:04.279 --> 00:14:07.362
It is the problem of the human beings,

00:14:07.737 --> 00:14:13.612
and if it is corrected by Me

00:14:13.987 --> 00:14:16.487
they'll take it for granted.

00:14:16.945 --> 00:14:18.945
They have to face those problems,

00:14:19.362 --> 00:14:21.112
they have to change their habits,

00:14:21.529 --> 00:14:24.237
they have to understand that they are the one

00:14:24.571 --> 00:14:26.987
who are destruct, destroying themselves.

00:14:27.446 --> 00:14:30.696
Otherwise if somebody's there just to cleanse it out,

00:14:31.154 --> 00:14:33.820
they will never change.

00:14:38.612 --> 00:14:42.903
Also, miraculously, one can do lots of things.

00:14:43.487 --> 00:14:45.654
One can say, "Mother, as You solve the problems

00:14:45.903 --> 00:14:48.987
of Sahaja yogis, why don't You solve the problem of others?"

00:14:49.279 --> 00:14:51.987
No.

00:14:52.737 --> 00:14:57.987
To solve their problem is not the end of My work,

00:14:58.903 --> 00:15:01.736
nor is the purpose.

00:15:02.154 --> 00:15:05.070
But to make them equipped

00:15:05.487 --> 00:15:08.654
so that they can solve their own problem,

00:15:09.028 --> 00:15:11.362
that's what I have to do.

00:15:11.737 --> 00:15:14.903
As I've said that

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.903
you have to be your own doctor,

00:15:18.279 --> 00:15:21.737
you have to be your own guru.

00:15:22.362 --> 00:15:25.112
Without Mahamaya you cannot do it

00:15:25.571 --> 00:15:31.862
because She knows how far to go in correcting,

00:15:33.446 --> 00:15:36.404
how far to go in controlling;

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:41.028
because human beings at large have their own freedom.

00:15:41.571 --> 00:15:46.320
Sahaja yogis have not that kind of a stupid freedom,

00:15:46.696 --> 00:15:49.862
but they have the freedom of the spirit.

00:15:50.362 --> 00:15:54.945
So to solve their problems is perfectly all right,

00:15:55.529 --> 00:15:58.612
because they must have more freedom and more freedom.

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:01.195
But what's the use of giving freedom

00:16:01.654 --> 00:16:05.028
to other people who are going on and on and on,

00:16:05.487 --> 00:16:07.320
without realizing what wrong

00:16:07.612 --> 00:16:09.320
they are doing to the whole world?

00:16:09.736 --> 00:16:13.028
So for them it is necessary to come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:16:13.446 --> 00:16:16.154
and that's why it's a Mahamaya swarupa.

00:16:16.903 --> 00:16:20.279
Maybe if I had come as Mother Mary

00:16:20.737 --> 00:16:23.237
or Radha or somebody like that,

00:16:23.696 --> 00:16:26.362
they would have been all here very nicely singing songs

00:16:26.696 --> 00:16:29.654
and all that. That's not the point.

00:16:30.028 --> 00:16:33.736
Now you have to mature, you have to be something,

00:16:34.195 --> 00:16:36.487
you have to grow.

00:16:36.987 --> 00:16:40.362
For that it is important

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:45.404
that you have to come to Sahaja Yoga first of all.

00:16:45.903 --> 00:16:47.987
Then you have to grow in Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:48.446 --> 00:16:50.862
Otherwise this Mahamaya will go on acting

00:16:51.279 --> 00:16:53.612
and playing tricks with you.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:58.571
Again taking water.

00:17:10.571 --> 00:17:13.195
So they also once said so,

00:17:13.654 --> 00:17:16.654
that "Why does She need water sometimes?

00:17:17.028 --> 00:17:20.696
She should be living on the air or some ..."

00:17:23.903 --> 00:17:26.404
It's a big play.

00:17:26.862 --> 00:17:31.279
Sahasrara, as you know, is Virata's area,

00:17:31.736 --> 00:17:33.487
Virat and Viratangana.

00:17:33.862 --> 00:17:39.112
Virata is Vishnu, who became Rama,

00:17:39.696 --> 00:17:42.654
then became Krishna and then Virat.

00:17:44.195 --> 00:17:47.487
So She's as a Leela,

00:17:48.028 --> 00:17:51.320
He's Leeladhara - it's a play;

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:53.529
and to make the play all right

00:17:53.987 --> 00:17:58.736
one has to be in the form of Mahamaya.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:04.696
But there are so many

00:18:09.404 --> 00:18:12.612
loopholes also sometimes.

00:18:13.529 --> 00:18:18.195
People can discover things very easily.

00:18:18.696 --> 00:18:22.696
One of them is this Paramchaitanya.

00:18:23.571 --> 00:18:26.446
This Paramchaitanya acts,

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:30.028
shows My photographs, exposes Me

00:18:30.404 --> 00:18:34.446
in all kinds of unbelievable manners

00:18:34.736 --> 00:18:36.987
which has never happened before.

00:18:37.404 --> 00:18:40.862
I am Myself amazed the way it thinks

00:18:41.237 --> 00:18:44.237
of exposing Me all the time.

00:18:50.696 --> 00:18:54.028
This time when we were in Brisbane

00:18:54.404 --> 00:18:59.737
they took a photograph of a rainbow outside,

00:19:00.237 --> 00:19:03.736
outside the ashram, and what appears there in the sky

00:19:04.028 --> 00:19:06.820
is very remarkable; it's going to come that photograph, too.

00:19:07.237 --> 00:19:10.362
Is a painting which I have always liked of Mother and Child,

00:19:10.737 --> 00:19:15.320
Madonna and the Child - in the sky, that painting.

00:19:15.778 --> 00:19:18.571
Now can you beat that?

00:19:19.112 --> 00:19:22.778
How does it know that I love that painting, and all that?

00:19:23.279 --> 00:19:25.737
And it was in the sky!

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:30.320
So this Paramachaitanya is trying to expose

00:19:30.737 --> 00:19:32.571
this Mahamaya swarupa,

00:19:32.945 --> 00:19:35.696
just to make you understand

00:19:35.945 --> 00:19:42.237
what is Mahamaya.

00:19:42.862 --> 00:19:47.446
It is trying to express itself.

00:19:48.487 --> 00:19:52.404
I have not in any way

00:19:53.028 --> 00:19:58.778
told or asked this Paramchaitanya to do any such things,

00:19:59.778 --> 00:20:01.737
but it is doing.

00:20:02.195 --> 00:20:05.362
Because it thinks that even now the people

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.195
who are following Mother

00:20:07.571 --> 00:20:11.112
are not of that level as they should be.

00:20:11.696 --> 00:20:14.778
Some of them do falter horribly, surprisingly

00:20:15.112 --> 00:20:17.404
- how far they can go I cannot believe.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.736
After coming to Sahaja Yoga, after seeing all My photographs,

00:20:21.028 --> 00:20:23.154
after everything else,

00:20:23.529 --> 00:20:29.362
they still can go to any limit of stupidity. That's a fact.

00:20:29.903 --> 00:20:32.820
So this is going on.

00:20:33.195 --> 00:20:36.112
I don't know how far this Paramchaitanya

00:20:36.612 --> 00:20:40.028
is spontaneously acting like this,

00:20:40.571 --> 00:20:42.320
but it shows one thing for definite,

00:20:42.736 --> 00:20:49.446
that it wants you to be perfectly settled down in your faith,

00:20:50.529 --> 00:20:53.612
which is not a blind faith.

00:20:54.195 --> 00:20:58.237
But most of these painting,

00:20:58.612 --> 00:21:00.820
photographs can be challenged.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.696
Anybody who's an intellectual

00:21:03.028 --> 00:21:04.571
can find out some ways and methods

00:21:04.862 --> 00:21:06.903
that can challenge you that "you must have done this."

00:21:07.279 --> 00:21:08.654
But as Sahaja yogis you know that

00:21:08.987 --> 00:21:12.320
we have done nothing of the kind, and it has come out.

00:21:12.737 --> 00:21:15.279
So what is the purpose?

00:21:15.778 --> 00:21:18.736
We don't show them to outsiders,

00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:24.028
we only show this to the Sahaja yogis.

00:21:24.612 --> 00:21:27.028
So what is the purpose?

00:21:27.487 --> 00:21:30.279
That Sahaja yogis should now

00:21:30.736 --> 00:21:37.154
try to understand that they have to grow.

00:21:39.571 --> 00:21:44.320
Now this growth has to be two-sided.

00:21:55.778 --> 00:22:00.070
One is

00:22:01.279 --> 00:22:04.903
yourself,

00:22:06.154 --> 00:22:13.237
"How much time do I spend thinking about Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:15.362 --> 00:22:18.654
and how much about my personal life,

00:22:19.028 --> 00:22:23.778
my education, my business, my duties,

00:22:24.154 --> 00:22:27.654
my jobs, my family?"

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.778
Because it is important,

00:22:34.362 --> 00:22:39.195
as the brain has to think and Virata is there.

00:22:39.862 --> 00:22:43.195
So in Sahasrara,

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:47.571
how much energy do we use

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.778
to think about Sahaja Yoga?

00:22:53.529 --> 00:22:58.154
How can we spread Sahaja Yoga?

00:22:58.987 --> 00:23:01.237
What should we do?

00:23:01.737 --> 00:23:03.903
What should we work it out?

00:23:04.404 --> 00:23:08.446
How much I should support, in which way?

00:23:10.154 --> 00:23:16.154
How it can be my every moment living?

00:23:17.195 --> 00:23:19.862
How I look at everything,

00:23:20.446 --> 00:23:23.529
I see Sahaj working in it?

00:23:24.237 --> 00:23:26.529
What is the Sahaj culture?

00:23:27.028 --> 00:23:29.529
Am I in the Sahaj culture?

00:23:30.028 --> 00:23:33.237
How much I'm impressed by other cultures

00:23:33.612 --> 00:23:35.404
and fashions and things?

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:41.237
And what have I to gain,

00:23:41.696 --> 00:23:47.736
to grow in my mental capacity to be a Sahaj?

00:23:49.279 --> 00:23:54.737
For example, a person who is a Sahaj personality,

00:23:55.195 --> 00:23:57.696
in everything he sees Sahaj, in everything,

00:23:58.028 --> 00:24:02.279
whether it is flowers, it's carpets, lights,

00:24:02.737 --> 00:24:06.945
statues, pendal, anything,

00:24:08.279 --> 00:24:11.571
it sees the Sahaj.

00:24:13.736 --> 00:24:18.320
How? See now, these pillars are standing at an angle;

00:24:18.778 --> 00:24:22.778
just imagine, to support it

00:24:23.195 --> 00:24:26.820
how you had to bend on one side.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.737
What do we do in Sahaj?

00:24:30.154 --> 00:24:34.571
We have to bend towards Divinity.

00:24:35.028 --> 00:24:41.362
See like that, all ideas go moving towards Sahaj.

00:24:42.028 --> 00:24:44.737
The whole thinking is Sahaj.

00:24:45.154 --> 00:24:46.612
Such a married life also

00:24:46.903 --> 00:24:48.362
between husband and wife I have seen.

00:24:48.737 --> 00:24:52.654
If both are Sahaj, they all the time talk of Sahaj

00:24:53.028 --> 00:24:57.195
- no frivolous talk, not useless talk, but only about Sahaj,

00:24:57.696 --> 00:25:02.279
how it is Sahaj to be husband and wife,

00:25:02.737 --> 00:25:04.903
what is the relationship,

00:25:05.279 --> 00:25:07.237
that's the most interesting in Sahaj.

00:25:07.612 --> 00:25:11.237
Like that, you see the everything that you do,

00:25:11.736 --> 00:25:14.736
you think on Sahaj way.

00:25:15.446 --> 00:25:19.571
So now then you can judge yourself in this Mahamaya.

00:25:20.195 --> 00:25:24.404
How far do you care really to think about Sahaj?

00:25:24.862 --> 00:25:26.903
But all other worries would be like this,

00:25:27.237 --> 00:25:30.404
"How much I will get money out of it?

00:25:30.778 --> 00:25:32.696
How much business I'll get?

00:25:33.154 --> 00:25:35.404
How much pleasure I can get?

00:25:37.945 --> 00:25:41.903
How much physical problems can be solved?"

00:25:42.529 --> 00:25:46.404
All these gains are nothing

00:25:46.862 --> 00:25:51.320
compared to your maturity in Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.237
But the mind takes over.

00:25:53.654 --> 00:25:56.279
It starts thinking and thinking,

00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:00.195
and it goes on wandering on various things:

00:26:00.736 --> 00:26:06.028
maybe your wife, your children, your house, this, that.

00:26:07.778 --> 00:26:10.987
But if you think in a Sahaj way you'll think,

00:26:11.446 --> 00:26:15.154
"I should do something that my children should be Sahaj.

00:26:15.696 --> 00:26:20.987
I should make a house which is useful to the Sahaj.

00:26:22.028 --> 00:26:26.279
I should behave in such a manner that I am Sahaj."

00:26:27.945 --> 00:26:30.820
The maturity in you should grow

00:26:31.237 --> 00:26:35.195
in such a way that you can feel it.

00:26:35.736 --> 00:26:39.404
Firstly is the peace.

00:26:39.945 --> 00:26:42.404
When person is not peaceful

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:48.112
his mind is like

00:26:48.696 --> 00:26:53.446
a wobbly instrument.

00:26:53.903 --> 00:26:56.862
He cannot think properly, he cannot see properly,

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.237
he cannot understand properly.

00:26:59.612 --> 00:27:03.612
You tell him something, he understands something else.

00:27:04.195 --> 00:27:09.237
Now the whole world today is wobbly,

00:27:09.612 --> 00:27:10.945
whole world.

00:27:11.362 --> 00:27:14.778
Here this new party

00:27:15.195 --> 00:27:18.820
has dismantled the other whole party in politics;

00:27:19.237 --> 00:27:21.736
it is this one is to be dismantled now.

00:27:22.112 --> 00:27:23.696
Everything is going upside-down.

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:27.945
That too is through Mahamaya.

00:27:33.987 --> 00:27:36.571
One has to admit

00:27:37.028 --> 00:27:42.529
that the way the, the way the world is in turmoil.

00:27:43.404 --> 00:27:46.028
It's not war, it's not cold war,

00:27:46.446 --> 00:27:49.945
but it's a kind of a funny type

00:27:50.404 --> 00:27:53.112
of a warfare

00:27:53.571 --> 00:27:56.404
which cannot be described in words, you see.

00:27:56.862 --> 00:28:00.654
Now, what will you say to what is happening in Italy today?

00:28:01.112 --> 00:28:04.028
What will you see to what is happening in Bosnia

00:28:04.446 --> 00:28:10.404
or any other place where you find stupid problems coming up

00:28:10.778 --> 00:28:13.571
and people killing each other, no peace,

00:28:13.903 --> 00:28:15.362
no sense of security.

00:28:15.737 --> 00:28:19.112
You find in the world, you use, you open the newspaper

00:28:19.654 --> 00:28:22.529
- we had an English newspaper today, I couldn't read:

00:28:22.987 --> 00:28:25.903
so many women were raped, so many men were killed,

00:28:26.237 --> 00:28:28.945
this thing happened; individually also.

00:28:29.404 --> 00:28:32.112
President doing nonsensical things like that.

00:28:32.529 --> 00:28:37.404
I mean, all sorts of things you see today is absurd.

00:28:38.028 --> 00:28:42.279
When we were of your age, we never heard of such things.

00:28:43.154 --> 00:28:46.446
People were dignified, sensible people.

00:28:46.903 --> 00:28:51.612
So now what has happened is they are just shattered.

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:56.070
There's no peace in their mind to see what they're doing,

00:28:56.446 --> 00:28:59.571
where are they, what is their responsibility.

00:29:02.571 --> 00:29:05.736
Horrible things are being expressed.

00:29:06.362 --> 00:29:09.028
Media is taking to all horrible things.

00:29:09.446 --> 00:29:11.195
It was never so before.

00:29:11.612 --> 00:29:15.446
We have read beautiful articles of beautiful things

00:29:15.778 --> 00:29:19.654
in the media itself, but today it is very different.

00:29:20.654 --> 00:29:22.987
Then it is a very materialistic world,

00:29:23.404 --> 00:29:25.404
extremely materialistic:

00:29:25.862 --> 00:29:28.237
marketing this, marketing that, marketing that,

00:29:28.612 --> 00:29:30.446
marketing human beings.

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:32.529
Then they are taking away children,

00:29:32.903 --> 00:29:36.237
taking away women, they're selling the children,

00:29:36.654 --> 00:29:42.320
they're selling the women - all kinds of things going on.

00:29:42.903 --> 00:29:46.195
Marketing God, marketing spirituality, marketing

00:29:46.654 --> 00:29:50.154
- I don't know what to say, but their own children.

00:29:50.654 --> 00:29:55.195
This kind of a perverse world is today.

00:29:55.945 --> 00:29:59.237
For that is needed Mahamaya,

00:29:59.778 --> 00:30:03.736
by which She shows that you have to pay

00:30:04.154 --> 00:30:09.028
through your noses for what you are doing, in this lifetime.

00:30:09.737 --> 00:30:13.487
Say, a man who is very wayward, destructive, who drinks,

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:17.987
smokes, goes away with women and all that:

00:30:18.362 --> 00:30:21.362
within two years he's bankrupt.

00:30:23.154 --> 00:30:25.237
So the reward is already there.

00:30:25.654 --> 00:30:28.279
Whatever he was doing is there to see.

00:30:28.737 --> 00:30:31.154
Another man - "What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong?"

00:30:31.487 --> 00:30:32.696
- goes on with nonsensical things.

00:30:33.028 --> 00:30:35.612
He get AIDS or he gets other diseases

00:30:35.987 --> 00:30:39.987
of a very incurable nature.

00:30:42.028 --> 00:30:47.237
We call it rokrah Devi: means "cash payment", cash payment;

00:30:48.195 --> 00:30:50.612
the Goddess who gives cash payment.

00:30:51.112 --> 00:30:53.362
"You do this - all right, have it.

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.903
You have done this - all right, enjoy this."

00:30:56.404 --> 00:31:00.028
Like that. It is really this Mahamaya specially

00:31:00.446 --> 00:31:03.612
who is now very much sort of active.

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:05.903
Sometimes I get a fright from Her,

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:10.028
for the way She is punishing people is a bit too much.

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:13.154
But it is so. If you do rash driving,

00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:16.820
"Oh, I'll enjoy rash driving" - all right, finished.

00:31:17.446 --> 00:31:22.070
You end up with a limping leg or a broken hand.

00:31:23.154 --> 00:31:29.279
So the laws, the divine law's at work through Mahamaya.

00:31:29.778 --> 00:31:32.987
It was not that fast before as it is today.

00:31:33.446 --> 00:31:37.612
Supposing there's a president of America

00:31:38.237 --> 00:31:41.945
- such a big position, I mean, imagine

00:31:42.571 --> 00:31:48.320
- he's being challenged by any third-rater from the street.

00:31:49.237 --> 00:31:51.820
How is it possible?

00:31:52.362 --> 00:31:55.070
Nobody could do that before.

00:31:55.571 --> 00:32:03.070
Because Mahamaya is using all its free will

00:32:04.945 --> 00:32:08.404
to check the free will of human beings.

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:11.571
The so-called freedom

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:17.529
that we are trying to enjoy

00:32:18.778 --> 00:32:22.237
is brought to an end.

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:25.487
People start thinking, what is it?

00:32:25.903 --> 00:32:27.237
- big people, you know.

00:32:27.612 --> 00:32:30.654
There was some boxer, very well-known,

00:32:30.987 --> 00:32:33.654
people used to run after him, now he's in jail.

00:32:34.112 --> 00:32:38.404
Another fellow who was doing this Grand Prix,

00:32:38.737 --> 00:32:42.654
which against I was always, died suddenly.

00:32:43.028 --> 00:32:45.154
Now people - he's a hero, this, that,

00:32:45.529 --> 00:32:47.571
but nobody will now do that, all right.

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:50.987
One hero is sufficient. Not me, sir,

00:32:51.446 --> 00:32:55.070
I'm not going to take to this Grand Prix business

00:32:55.362 --> 00:32:56.736
- had enough of it.

00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:59.028
So, though one hero is created,

00:32:59.487 --> 00:33:04.195
but the fear of doing this kind of a nonsense.

00:33:04.736 --> 00:33:08.862
Then they go for - what is called that? - skiing.

00:33:09.404 --> 00:33:12.737
Now in the skiing also somebody died

00:33:13.237 --> 00:33:15.987
and somebody got a lame leg;

00:33:16.404 --> 00:33:18.195
I think in the royal family something happened,

00:33:18.654 --> 00:33:22.737
so now from England very few people are going for skiing.

00:33:23.404 --> 00:33:27.903
Now only the Swiss have to learn a lesson, I think.

00:33:28.446 --> 00:33:32.446
It's something - you just keep your eyes open.

00:33:32.945 --> 00:33:36.279
Today you read somebody boasting very much about himself,

00:33:36.737 --> 00:33:39.612
tomorrow you find him in the jail, you know.

00:33:40.154 --> 00:33:43.487
It was very surprising, there was a some minister in Italy

00:33:43.862 --> 00:33:45.446
who wanted Me to meet, and I said,

00:33:45.736 --> 00:33:46.903
"Oh baba, I don't want to meet him."

00:33:47.237 --> 00:33:50.737
He's a very bad past. He's in jail already,

00:33:51.195 --> 00:33:54.487
so I can't meet him now.

00:34:01.612 --> 00:34:04.487
They are falling into their own traps.

00:34:04.945 --> 00:34:07.279
This trap is Mahamaya.

00:34:07.736 --> 00:34:12.696
She creates from your own - it's through your own,

00:34:13.154 --> 00:34:15.529
because you don't want to face yourself,

00:34:15.903 --> 00:34:17.737
you don't want to know the truth,

00:34:18.237 --> 00:34:21.529
you want to evade the truth.

00:34:22.404 --> 00:34:24.612
So this is the aspect of Mahamaya,

00:34:25.028 --> 00:34:28.862
that immediately you have to face yourself.

00:34:29.737 --> 00:34:32.987
How many things have happened? Think of it.

00:34:33.487 --> 00:34:36.487
These big, big tycoons are in jail.

00:34:37.028 --> 00:34:42.154
Very famous people from, say, drug

00:34:42.945 --> 00:34:49.571
- great, rich people, they are in jail.

00:34:50.404 --> 00:34:53.279
All such things are happening.

00:34:53.612 --> 00:34:54.820
Why?

00:34:55.112 --> 00:35:00.154
Because this Mahamaya is the one who wants to teach a lesson.

00:35:00.571 --> 00:35:02.446
By teaching a lesson to one person

00:35:02.778 --> 00:35:05.070
it shatters at least thousands,

00:35:05.487 --> 00:35:08.737
because that person sees the point,

00:35:09.279 --> 00:35:12.320
as death comes to it or whatever it comes to it.

00:35:12.737 --> 00:35:15.070
Maybe he may not learn the lesson,

00:35:15.446 --> 00:35:17.778
was he already dead to learn anything any more;

00:35:18.112 --> 00:35:20.612
but others are.

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:23.154
It, how it spreads.

00:35:23.529 --> 00:35:25.446
So in a way the media also,

00:35:25.903 --> 00:35:27.696
that always gives bad news,

00:35:28.028 --> 00:35:30.404
in a way does not know

00:35:30.736 --> 00:35:34.696
how much good it is doing through Mahamaya.

00:35:37.112 --> 00:35:41.320
Now for your information, many things we are saying about

00:35:41.654 --> 00:35:44.195
- like say, smoking is already going out.

00:35:44.696 --> 00:35:46.612
Drinking will also go out.

00:35:47.112 --> 00:35:51.320
What did the Sahaj do? Nothing - but a Mahamaya.

00:35:52.862 --> 00:35:54.279
They get cancers.

00:35:54.696 --> 00:35:57.696
Doctors have got the idea now, they have got cancer,

00:35:58.028 --> 00:36:01.696
and they have asked people that now don't smoke,

00:36:02.028 --> 00:36:03.654
otherwise you'll get cancer.

00:36:04.112 --> 00:36:07.736
So the Mahamaya creates

00:36:08.279 --> 00:36:14.279
that kind of an, I should say, an incident.

00:36:15.404 --> 00:36:17.654
Single incident is sufficient

00:36:18.028 --> 00:36:23.195
for people to be extremely cautious.

00:36:24.529 --> 00:36:28.654
Moreover, it is such a panicked world,

00:36:29.195 --> 00:36:31.320
so insecure today.

00:36:31.737 --> 00:36:37.237
Suddenly you find the cows are giving poison in their milk,

00:36:37.736 --> 00:36:39.612
there's something else happening,

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:42.320
the water is getting polluted.

00:36:42.737 --> 00:36:45.112
Then suddenly you find there are needles,

00:36:45.654 --> 00:36:48.112
which are infected.

00:36:48.571 --> 00:36:51.654
So everybody is so nervous

00:36:52.195 --> 00:36:55.237
and thinking about

00:36:56.404 --> 00:36:59.195
saving their lives, so

00:36:59.736 --> 00:37:02.778
they start thinking about it.

00:37:03.736 --> 00:37:06.320
But in Sahaj

00:37:06.737 --> 00:37:10.903
if you come, none of these things can trouble you,

00:37:11.487 --> 00:37:16.487
because this is the aspect of Mahamaya that She protects you.

00:37:17.446 --> 00:37:18.862
She protects you.

00:37:19.237 --> 00:37:21.195
Nobody can destroy a Sahaja yogi,

00:37:21.529 --> 00:37:23.612
unless and until they want to be destroyed.

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:28.654
It's their desire. Nobody can touch them.

00:37:29.195 --> 00:37:31.903
Now when they talk about miracles - like the other day

00:37:32.362 --> 00:37:35.987
one boy from Australia, a new Sahaja yogi,

00:37:36.571 --> 00:37:38.112
was going on a motorbike

00:37:38.487 --> 00:37:40.696
and suddenly he was in a great speed,

00:37:41.028 --> 00:37:45.737
and from both the sides two trucks came and they hit him.

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:50.070
But instead of getting hit, he was just sort of

00:37:50.571 --> 00:37:54.571
pushed out like a shuttlecock and he fell on the other side;

00:37:54.987 --> 00:37:56.654
and he was not at all hurt and he got up,

00:37:56.987 --> 00:37:58.571
and they were surprised.

00:37:58.945 --> 00:38:02.987
His bike was shattered, everything,

00:38:03.362 --> 00:38:04.862
and this fellow's perfectly all right.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:08.446
They couldn't understand how this boy has saved himself.

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:11.487
There are so many, so many stories like that,

00:38:11.903 --> 00:38:17.237
that shows that how this Mahamaya is protecting Sahaja yogis:

00:38:17.862 --> 00:38:21.404
protection, very caring.

00:38:21.987 --> 00:38:25.736
Also in dreams She protects.

00:38:26.154 --> 00:38:29.571
It's very surprising how people get dreams

00:38:30.112 --> 00:38:32.487
and how they get their medicines,

00:38:32.987 --> 00:38:35.028
how they get their treatment,

00:38:35.487 --> 00:38:38.862
how they understand about the dangers that are there,

00:38:39.362 --> 00:38:43.320
how in dreams they are told about how other people are,

00:38:43.654 --> 00:38:45.154
how they behave.

00:38:45.654 --> 00:38:48.571
You don't have to know it in conscious mind,

00:38:48.987 --> 00:38:55.070
but into the very, very deep sushupti state in dreams,

00:38:55.487 --> 00:38:59.987
you know what is good for you, what is bad for you.

00:39:00.571 --> 00:39:03.362
Somehow they know.

00:39:05.112 --> 00:39:11.028
And it is that knowledge which - intuitive, we can call it

00:39:11.529 --> 00:39:14.112
- comes through Mahamaya.

00:39:14.571 --> 00:39:19.112
She's the one who gives you this intuitive knowledge

00:39:19.529 --> 00:39:22.778
what to be done, what is to be done,

00:39:23.279 --> 00:39:26.654
how to get out of problems. And you do;

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:30.154
whether you manage it or not, you get out of it.

00:39:30.612 --> 00:39:35.195
There's so many examples of this, thousand and one.

00:39:37.862 --> 00:39:40.320
One of them I'll tell you;

00:39:41.487 --> 00:39:42.820
it comes to My mind now.

00:39:43.154 --> 00:39:45.612
In Australia there was a very, very nice Sahaja yogi,

00:39:45.862 --> 00:39:47.696
very great Sahaja yogi, very learned one

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:49.320
but a simple man.

00:39:49.696 --> 00:39:51.654
And another horrible one

00:39:52.028 --> 00:39:54.529
told him that he should buy this particular land

00:39:54.862 --> 00:39:58.112
and particular thing called Lilydale,

00:39:58.487 --> 00:40:00.571
and "We can start Sahaja Yoga there.

00:40:00.862 --> 00:40:02.903
We can do this, we can do that."

00:40:03.279 --> 00:40:05.070
So whatever earnings he had,

00:40:05.529 --> 00:40:09.736
he put it there as a - to begin with.

00:40:10.778 --> 00:40:13.070
And the bank said, "We'll give you money."

00:40:13.612 --> 00:40:17.070
But in that report he had written that

00:40:18.736 --> 00:40:22.737
"We have Sahaja Yoga properties, my properties, anything.

00:40:23.195 --> 00:40:27.487
That this is there available in case we fail to pay."

00:40:28.154 --> 00:40:32.696
When I saw this I thought, "Now it's too much."

00:40:33.362 --> 00:40:35.195
So I asked the lawyer and he said that

00:40:35.571 --> 00:40:37.320
it is better you give it in the newspaper,

00:40:37.696 --> 00:40:39.737
otherwise nobody can take your land

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:41.279
or anything or your property,

00:40:41.696 --> 00:40:42.945
but one thing is for sure

00:40:43.446 --> 00:40:47.237
that you will have to go to court for years together.

00:40:47.862 --> 00:40:49.820
So best is to give in the newspaper,

00:40:50.195 --> 00:40:52.362
that you have nothing to do with this Lilydale,

00:40:52.737 --> 00:40:55.070
nor Sahaja Yoga has anything to do with it.

00:40:55.529 --> 00:40:57.070
Now this gentleman got very upset

00:40:57.362 --> 00:40:59.446
because the bank would not give the money,

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:01.903
and then the people who were selling it

00:41:02.362 --> 00:41:05.070
put a suit against him.

00:41:05.736 --> 00:41:07.820
He was already a bankrupt, he didn't know what to do

00:41:08.154 --> 00:41:09.862
and was very much in trouble.

00:41:10.404 --> 00:41:12.820
I said, "Don't worry,

00:41:13.696 --> 00:41:16.237
you are under protection."

00:41:16.737 --> 00:41:18.487
And you'll be amazed that

00:41:18.862 --> 00:41:22.404
despite all kinds of fears people had

00:41:22.778 --> 00:41:24.279
that he might be arrested

00:41:24.654 --> 00:41:27.654
or God knows whatever house he has will be sold out,

00:41:27.945 --> 00:41:31.237
everything; on the contrary that Lilydale,

00:41:31.654 --> 00:41:34.903
somebody offered money to purchase it at a much higher price.

00:41:35.279 --> 00:41:38.237
So he got a higher price,

00:41:40.154 --> 00:41:42.862
and so he sold it.

00:41:43.404 --> 00:41:45.028
But you have to have patience,

00:41:45.487 --> 00:41:48.195
and you have to have faith and courage.

00:41:48.778 --> 00:41:52.696
He said, "Mother, I know nobody can destroy me."

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:57.404
And this is how the protection of the Mahamaya,

00:41:57.903 --> 00:41:59.404
the first part of Mahamaya

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:04.362
was to make this man expose

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:07.736
this bad Sahaja yogi to all the people.

00:42:08.195 --> 00:42:10.195
There was a big following for him,

00:42:10.571 --> 00:42:13.654
and a good speaker, this and that;

00:42:14.237 --> 00:42:17.320
then all they dropped out.

00:42:18.404 --> 00:42:21.487
So it works also on the collective side.

00:42:22.279 --> 00:42:25.903
There's someone who tries to trouble the Sahaja yogis:

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:27.737
all right,

00:42:28.154 --> 00:42:31.446
the Mahamaya allows him to trouble for a point,

00:42:31.778 --> 00:42:35.903
up to a point, and then suddenly She acts,

00:42:36.487 --> 00:42:38.571
so the people are amazed,

00:42:38.987 --> 00:42:42.862
Sahaja yogis are amazed how this man has become like this.

00:42:44.778 --> 00:42:50.571
This Mahamaya is always like My sari, as you say

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:54.362
- is protecting you.

00:42:54.862 --> 00:42:58.987
She's beautiful, She's very kind, caring, compassionate,

00:42:59.487 --> 00:43:03.778
affectionate; delicately She handles you.

00:43:04.529 --> 00:43:08.446
And She's very, very

00:43:14.279 --> 00:43:19.987
angry and kills the people

00:43:20.362 --> 00:43:24.778
who try to spoil the work of God,

00:43:25.237 --> 00:43:27.612
like rakshasas and devils,

00:43:28.028 --> 00:43:32.737
and keeps you clean, out of all these bad hands.

00:43:35.737 --> 00:43:39.112
Another very good aspect of Mahamaya is

00:43:39.612 --> 00:43:42.320
that She transforms you.

00:43:42.903 --> 00:43:45.903
Everything is in the brain for human beings.

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:49.737
If you are a crook, you're a crook in the brain.

00:43:51.737 --> 00:43:56.070
If you are a person who hates others, it's all in the brain.

00:43:56.945 --> 00:44:02.654
If you are a addict to something, it's all in the brain.

00:44:04.571 --> 00:44:09.778
It's a very complicated conditioning in the head.

00:44:10.945 --> 00:44:14.487
So this Sahasrara is very important, no doubt,

00:44:15.237 --> 00:44:21.571
but the power of Virata and Viratangana

00:44:22.736 --> 00:44:27.404
can only be effective if there is Mahamaya rupa.

00:44:29.028 --> 00:44:34.028
And She, in Her own sweet ways, opens,

00:44:35.446 --> 00:44:38.903
dislodges all these conditionings

00:44:39.696 --> 00:44:41.737
which make you ugly,

00:44:42.154 --> 00:44:45.195
which make you horrible,

00:44:45.778 --> 00:44:49.195
which makes you hot tempered,

00:44:50.862 --> 00:44:52.903
non-Sahaja yogis.

00:44:53.487 --> 00:44:58.112
She's the one who really, like the Mother Earth,

00:44:58.737 --> 00:45:01.571
gives all that She has,

00:45:02.028 --> 00:45:08.778
to make you really very joyous, happy,

00:45:09.903 --> 00:45:16.070
so that you enjoy nirananda - nothing but ananda,

00:45:17.404 --> 00:45:20.529
nothing but joy.

00:45:21.362 --> 00:45:25.737
And this is what is the Sahasrara.

00:45:26.154 --> 00:45:28.737
But it's only possible

00:45:30.612 --> 00:45:34.737
when your brahmarandhra is to be opened out;

00:45:35.279 --> 00:45:39.571
otherwise you cannot enter into the subtleties

00:45:40.154 --> 00:45:44.195
of divine love, compassion,

00:45:44.696 --> 00:45:49.571
of that ever-flowing Mahamaya.

00:45:50.736 --> 00:45:53.736
From the outside I have told you what She is,

00:45:54.154 --> 00:45:59.736
but from inside when you enter, penetrate into Her

00:46:02.654 --> 00:46:04.696
through the brahmarandhra,

00:46:05.195 --> 00:46:10.070
then this Mahamaya which is an incarnation, as you know,

00:46:10.612 --> 00:46:14.112
of this all-pervading Power,

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:17.987
becomes very different.

00:46:18.487 --> 00:46:22.612
On one side She tries to teach you lessons,

00:46:23.487 --> 00:46:25.945
She tries to destroy that is evil,

00:46:26.487 --> 00:46:29.612
all that is harmful, all that is destructive;

00:46:30.112 --> 00:46:35.571
and on the other side She loves you, protects you,

00:46:37.028 --> 00:46:39.987
very delicately guides you.

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:45.987
Her love is without any expectations.

00:46:46.404 --> 00:46:50.028
She loves because She cannot help but to love.

00:46:51.112 --> 00:46:54.362
So in that love you are drenched.

00:46:54.903 --> 00:46:56.320
You enjoy it.

00:46:56.736 --> 00:47:02.778
Everybody knows that they are close to Her,

00:47:03.903 --> 00:47:05.736
absolutely close to Her.

00:47:06.154 --> 00:47:09.154
Whenever they want they can always ask Her help;

00:47:09.654 --> 00:47:13.195
wherever they are, they are supported by Her.

00:47:13.903 --> 00:47:16.736
So this Sahasrara is very important,

00:47:17.237 --> 00:47:20.237
because through this only we react,

00:47:20.778 --> 00:47:23.529
through this we accumulate

00:47:25.279 --> 00:47:27.028
all kinds of nonsense.

00:47:27.487 --> 00:47:30.529
In the world of this nonsense that we are living,

00:47:30.945 --> 00:47:33.903
we have to be something like the lotuses

00:47:34.529 --> 00:47:36.737
who cannot be tarnished,

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:40.028
who cannot be affected

00:47:40.529 --> 00:47:43.903
by all the ills that are going on.

00:47:44.571 --> 00:47:47.778
This is what is the test, is the pariksha,

00:47:48.237 --> 00:47:50.404
that at this time,

00:47:50.862 --> 00:47:53.612
at this difficult time

00:47:54.237 --> 00:47:56.612
we can blossom

00:47:57.237 --> 00:48:00.070
and create fragrance,

00:48:00.529 --> 00:48:05.696
and get so many others to this beautiful atmosphere.

00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:09.820
It is a kind

00:48:10.737 --> 00:48:17.195
of a beautiful, playful war, I - we can say,

00:48:19.696 --> 00:48:23.778
against what is supposed to be negative.

00:48:24.279 --> 00:48:26.737
What is the power of this negativity?

00:48:27.279 --> 00:48:29.404
What is the power of these conditionings?

00:48:29.862 --> 00:48:34.654
What is the power of this stupidity that anybody can see?

00:48:38.237 --> 00:48:41.778
So you develop the sight, the vision.

00:48:43.028 --> 00:48:46.529
So clearly, you understand so clearly

00:48:46.987 --> 00:48:50.903
that you are the ones who are responsible.

00:48:51.446 --> 00:48:56.903
You are the cells of this Sahasrara, of this brain,

00:48:57.446 --> 00:48:59.320
and you all have to act.

00:48:59.737 --> 00:49:02.612
I was yesterday enamored when you said

00:49:03.112 --> 00:49:07.487
that these lights have to enlighten many lights.

00:49:08.195 --> 00:49:11.154
This was really a great promise to Me.

00:49:11.654 --> 00:49:12.820
So coming to Sahaja Yoga

00:49:13.154 --> 00:49:17.487
is not just for your personal limited

00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:20.487
personalities and their problems,

00:49:20.903 --> 00:49:25.237
but as I said, it's you

00:49:25.737 --> 00:49:27.862
on one side has to grow,

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:31.154
and on the other side

00:49:31.903 --> 00:49:35.487
everyone has to grow through you.

00:49:36.028 --> 00:49:40.487
So this is the second side which you should look after.

00:49:41.362 --> 00:49:44.028
Today of course I am very happy

00:49:44.529 --> 00:49:46.571
that in My lifetime I could see

00:49:47.028 --> 00:49:50.612
the manifestation of Mahamaya.

00:49:51.070 --> 00:49:53.070
It's such a beautiful one,

00:49:53.529 --> 00:49:56.112
that this door that is opened

00:49:56.778 --> 00:50:01.112
is now just

00:50:02.362 --> 00:50:06.487
able to enter into the Kingdom of God,

00:50:06.987 --> 00:50:11.195
and to enjoy the heavenly bliss and the protection.

00:50:11.737 --> 00:50:13.654
But have faith in it.

00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:15.945
Have faith in it.

00:50:16.362 --> 00:50:20.028
Do not get disturbed by small things,

00:50:20.487 --> 00:50:23.696
and I am sure it will work out in a very great way.

00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:28.737
If you get that complete faith

00:50:31.154 --> 00:50:36.571
and a complete surrendering,

00:50:37.279 --> 00:50:40.070
I am sure it will work out very well.

00:50:40.612 --> 00:50:44.571
May God bless you.

00:51:00.654 --> 00:51:08.070
So we'll have a little Ganesh Puja and then Sahasrara Puja.
