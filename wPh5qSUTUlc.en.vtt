00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.250
Today we are going to celebrate the birth of Christ.

00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:25.999
At a very crucial time we are doing that,

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:32.166
because there are some anti-Christ

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.709
who have become in charge of the Christian religion

00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:43.125
and are talking against the birth of Christ.

00:00:43.917 --> 00:00:48.834
They have no authority, they are not realized souls,

00:00:49.041 --> 00:00:53.542
they have no idea of the Divine, nothing,

00:00:53.792 --> 00:00:57.875
and they are saying that it is all falsehood

00:00:58.041 --> 00:01:02.583
that She was not a virgin

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:07.959
and that Christ was not born that way.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.917
Who told them? Did Gabriel come and told them?

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:19.333
What right they have got to talk these things?

00:01:19.625 --> 00:01:23.166
So because they are anti-Christ now they have become

00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:28.375
in charge of Christianity. Even Pope is like that.

00:01:28.583 --> 00:01:30.999
So in Satya Yuga they will be all exposed,

00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:35.792
have to be exposed. But some people who are here,

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:39.875
can write to this man to ask, "What is your authority to say?

00:01:40.041 --> 00:01:43.417
Have you felt the allpervading power of God's love?

00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:48.625
Have you any divinity in you to challenge Christ like that?"

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:54.709
There must be some incarnations of Paul perhaps.

00:01:54.917 --> 00:01:58.083
They cannot understand Divine.

00:01:58.291 --> 00:02:01.333
They don't know what Divine can do.

00:02:01.542 --> 00:02:07.500
They have no idea at all, how miraculous it is.

00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:13.750
You all have felt the blessings of the Divine.

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:18.041
You all know that it is a miracle.

00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:23.417
Every time there's a miracle produced.

00:02:24.375 --> 00:02:30.375
I will narrate one simple example.

00:02:30.834 --> 00:02:34.375
In the Navaratri Puja we had some photographs.

00:02:34.583 --> 00:02:39.250
And behind the photograph some sort of a scene came

00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:43.417
which I was wondering what is this is supposed to be.

00:02:43.625 --> 00:02:46.375
The scene was that

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:52.542
the Surya was

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:55.583
moving a curtain.

00:02:55.792 --> 00:02:59.291
Eyes of the, there were eyes for the Surya, mouth, nose

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.542
and He was smiling and moving a curtain like that.

00:03:04.792 --> 00:03:07.625
I said, "What is this?

00:03:07.834 --> 00:03:11.917
What this is indicative in the Navaratri Puja?

00:03:12.083 --> 00:03:16.083
But when I went to Moscow, I was surprised,

00:03:16.333 --> 00:03:20.291
that they had painted the background just like this.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.291
Exactly like this there was the background.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.667
So Navaratri Puja, which took at least one and a half month before,

00:03:29.875 --> 00:03:33.333
the Paramchaitanya painted there.

00:03:34.667 --> 00:03:37.208
It's very remarkable,

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:41.917
how things work out miraculously.

00:03:42.917 --> 00:03:48.875
And there are thousand and one miracles we can talk about.

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:59.166
When we were in the aeroplane, going to Moscow

00:03:59.375 --> 00:04:02.709
they said the temperature is minus twenty.

00:04:02.917 --> 00:04:05.999
We got down, they said it is minus fifteen.

00:04:06.166 --> 00:04:09.834
Next morning they said it is coming down very fast,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.375
is touching about minus twelve.

00:04:13.583 --> 00:04:16.999
And after one day they said it is minus four.

00:04:17.166 --> 00:04:21.166
But next day it was plus ten.

00:04:21.375 --> 00:04:25.375
I mean as the time passes,

00:04:25.583 --> 00:04:29.291
it has to be cooler and cooler.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.625
This time My husband was going to Moscow.

00:04:31.834 --> 00:04:34.834
He said, "It's very cold there now, minus twenty".

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.291
He sent word that... I said, "Don't worry, it will put it right".

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.999
He said when he arrived it was only minus two.

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:49.166
So all these things show that all the elements are helping us.

00:04:49.875 --> 00:04:54.083
All the

00:04:54.291 --> 00:04:59.959
other problems, minor, big, anything, get solved in no time.

00:05:00.125 --> 00:05:03.792
You are sometimes amazed how things are done.

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:08.583
So then they question, "Then why Christ had to be crucified?

00:05:08.834 --> 00:05:13.959
Why could You not save Him from crucifixion?"

00:05:14.125 --> 00:05:20.083
He was crucified because that was to be done in His case,

00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:22.792
that He had to pass through the Agya,

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:25.083
He had to establish Himself in Agya,

00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:28.999
and the cross, He had to pass through that.

00:05:29.208 --> 00:05:34.583
So the message of His Life is never the cross,

00:05:34.792 --> 00:05:37.999
but the message is His Resurrection.

00:05:38.208 --> 00:05:43.166
He resurrected - that was one of the things He did very great -

00:05:43.375 --> 00:05:47.709
so that now you can be resurrected also.

00:05:47.917 --> 00:05:50.333
In every incarnation, in the evolution,

00:05:50.542 --> 00:05:55.792
every incarnation did something very, very unique.

00:05:55.999 --> 00:06:01.125
At the end of it, Christ, did the Resurrection part.

00:06:01.333 --> 00:06:04.959
And He did it because He had to die,

00:06:05.125 --> 00:06:09.542
otherwise how can you resurrect yourself?

00:06:09.792 --> 00:06:15.291
So there are lots of things which look mythical, which are not.

00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:21.417
Tomorrow they'll say that Christ never resurrected Himself.

00:06:21.792 --> 00:06:25.917
And actually He died later on in Kashmir.

00:06:26.083 --> 00:06:28.583
There's a proof of it.

00:06:28.792 --> 00:06:32.583
But still the people don't want to believe,

00:06:32.792 --> 00:06:35.750
and they just wanted to spread Christianity,

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:40.542
because they know that if you have majority of people

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.375
then they can rule.

00:06:42.583 --> 00:06:45.750
The same trick now is tried by politicians.

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:49.875
But this kind of a majority is not going to bring any solace

00:06:50.041 --> 00:06:54.208
or any benevolence for people.

00:06:54.583 --> 00:06:58.999
Christ's Mother Herself has been challenged by this man

00:06:59.166 --> 00:07:01.999
and said all kinds of nonsense about Her.

00:07:02.166 --> 00:07:04.999
On the contrary Mohammad Sahib in Quran says

00:07:05.208 --> 00:07:07.542
nobody should challenge the chastity

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.125
of the Holy Mother, of Christ's Mother.

00:07:10.333 --> 00:07:13.458
He has respected,

00:07:13.667 --> 00:07:19.667
while there is no respect shown to Mother Mary

00:07:20.208 --> 00:07:23.083
in the Bible, no respect. She's called "a woman".

00:07:23.291 --> 00:07:24.875
Because of Paul

00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:28.083
who was a horrible anti-Christ  who came over,

00:07:28.291 --> 00:07:31.709
who took over Christianity, tried to spread Christianity

00:07:31.917 --> 00:07:35.917
and with that what he wanted, to put his own importance.

00:07:36.083 --> 00:07:37.458
And he used Peter

00:07:37.667 --> 00:07:42.709
who was the worst possible disciple of Christ,

00:07:42.917 --> 00:07:48.917
whom Christ has told that, "Satan will take you over".

00:07:49.542 --> 00:07:52.166
So now,

00:07:52.375 --> 00:07:57.291
they are telling people that, "It's impossible, how can it be

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:03.500
that Christ was born to a virgin?"

00:08:07.709 --> 00:08:11.458
We  Indians  worship Shri Ganesh.

00:08:11.667 --> 00:08:14.834
Shri Ganesh is the same as Christ,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.792
and we believe that the Mother Herself created the Child

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:22.792
without, as a Virgin, as a Gauri.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.083
Not only believe but we, it's our faith.

00:08:28.375 --> 00:08:34.375
While the faith in the West  is all rationality.

00:08:34.875 --> 00:08:37.709
They go on thinking like that

00:08:37.959 --> 00:08:41.208
and they go on producing yarn of falsehood.

00:08:41.417 --> 00:08:42.875
What was the need for newspapers

00:08:43.041 --> 00:08:47.667
to publish this nonsense of this Dharam fellow?

00:08:47.875 --> 00:08:50.792
And then he was honored,

00:08:50.999 --> 00:08:55.792
honored by the archbishop of Canterbury, who is another anti-Christ.

00:08:55.999 --> 00:09:01.750
He honored him and just after that,

00:09:01.959 --> 00:09:04.834
that church where he was honored,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.709
was completely burned by Vishnumaya.

00:09:09.917 --> 00:09:12.333
She was looming round it for one hour

00:09:12.542 --> 00:09:14.375
and then She burn it completely.

00:09:14.583 --> 00:09:17.166
Only the lower portion was left

00:09:17.375 --> 00:09:21.166
because there were also very beautiful paintings, maybe.

00:09:21.375 --> 00:09:23.750
Now the stupid fools are saying

00:09:23.959 --> 00:09:29.792
that,  "it is God's grace on us that they saved us,

00:09:29.999 --> 00:09:34.291
from this Vishnumaya, the lower portion of it".

00:09:34.625 --> 00:09:38.291
But way did it burn?

00:09:39.125 --> 00:09:42.709
So you have to understand that rationality can never

00:09:42.917 --> 00:09:46.000
make you understand Divinity, can never.

00:09:46.208 --> 00:09:49.959
It is so limited, so conditioned, full of ego.

00:09:50.125 --> 00:09:51.625
How can the rationality

00:09:51.834 --> 00:09:56.750
tell you what is the truth about Christ's life.

00:09:56.959 --> 00:10:02.625
But we have proof also, scientifically.

00:10:02.917 --> 00:10:05.667
So you must be knowing that

00:10:05.875 --> 00:10:08.792
I told them that  if you see from right to the left

00:10:08.999 --> 00:10:11.750
you see a swastika.

00:10:11.959 --> 00:10:14.500
Because of carbon, the way it is made.

00:10:14.709 --> 00:10:19.333
If you see the carbon atom, you see a swastika from left to right.

00:10:19.542 --> 00:10:21.917
We have made a big model out of it.

00:10:22.083 --> 00:10:25.834
And then you put

00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:30.125
it in other way, means you see it from left to the right,

00:10:30.333 --> 00:10:33.792
then you see Omkara, no doubt.

00:10:33.999 --> 00:10:39.667
And then you see from down below, you see Alpha and Omega.

00:10:39.875 --> 00:10:45.417
Christ has said it that ,"I am the Alpha and the Omega".

00:10:45.625 --> 00:10:49.333
At that time I did know if these symbols were there or not.

00:10:49.542 --> 00:10:54.166
Whatever it is, He did say, "I am the Alpha and the Omega".

00:10:54.375 --> 00:10:56.417
Also it has another meaning

00:10:56.625 --> 00:10:59.583
that "I am the beginning, I am the end".

00:10:59.792 --> 00:11:02.125
But Alpha and Omega

00:11:02.333 --> 00:11:06.375
the way He said it, you can see it clearly, symbolically,

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:09.208
clearly, if you see it from down upward.

00:11:09.417 --> 00:11:13.709
So, the Omkara on one side, swastika on another side

00:11:13.917 --> 00:11:17.542
join together when they ascend and incarnate,

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:21.709
they become Alpha and Omega.

00:11:21.917 --> 00:11:24.875
But all these doesn't going to the heads of these anti-Christs.

00:11:25.041 --> 00:11:27.333
They are all anti-Christ.

00:11:27.542 --> 00:11:31.291
And they can not understand what Divinity can do.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.375
You got your Realization, your second birth

00:11:35.583 --> 00:11:39.000
just sitting here. How did you manage?

00:11:39.208 --> 00:11:41.792
How did you get your second birth?

00:11:41.999 --> 00:11:44.792
And the way these people talk

00:11:44.999 --> 00:11:48.583
is definitely for their doom,

00:11:48.792 --> 00:11:52.333
for their complete destruction.

00:11:53.875 --> 00:11:58.375
It's too much of daring, as you know that

00:11:58.583 --> 00:12:04.583
Shri Ganesha is a very powerful

00:12:05.375 --> 00:12:07.041
deity.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:10.375
Same Christ.

00:12:10.583 --> 00:12:13.875
He has said, "If you say anything against the Holy Ghost,

00:12:14.041 --> 00:12:16.291
I will not tolerate".

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:21.959
And also, against Christ I will not tolerate,

00:12:22.166 --> 00:12:23.834
a word even.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.041
Only on that point I'll have to see to it,

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:32.125
that all these horrible people, should be destroyed completely.

00:12:32.375 --> 00:12:37.417
On this occasion of His birthday we have to realize

00:12:37.625 --> 00:12:43.041
that Christ was born

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:49.041
from same things as Shri Ganesh.

00:12:49.333 --> 00:12:54.291
So He was wisdom, source of wisdom.

00:12:55.041 --> 00:12:59.834
He said few things because they didn't allow him to live long,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.458
at the most three of,

00:13:01.667 --> 00:13:04.250
three and a half years He could lecture to people.

00:13:04.458 --> 00:13:10.458
But whatever He said is so truthful, so correct  and so wise.

00:13:10.667 --> 00:13:13.750
Of course they might have tried to dabble with that

00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:18.166
but still lots of truths are left in the Bible, no doubt about it.

00:13:18.375 --> 00:13:22.875
And His lifetime He spent

00:13:23.041 --> 00:13:26.625
in just telling them what is the truth is.

00:13:26.834 --> 00:13:29.625
He is the first one

00:13:29.834 --> 00:13:34.333
who talked so clearly about God.

00:13:34.959 --> 00:13:37.875
On His level we have three other people,

00:13:38.041 --> 00:13:41.083
in the area of tapa which is here.

00:13:41.333 --> 00:13:46.458
One is Buddha, another is Mahavira.

00:13:46.667 --> 00:13:51.542
Now, both Buddha and Mahavira were born at a time when they saw

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:56.375
that ritualism is taking place the reality.

00:13:56.583 --> 00:14:00.000
So they said, "We'll not talk of God, Anishwarwad.

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:05.333
We'll not talk of God". First we'll only talk about the Chaitanya.

00:14:05.542 --> 00:14:06.999
That everybody did.

00:14:07.166 --> 00:14:11.542
Even the Guru of Janaka,

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:15.250
who was Ashtavakra, only talked about the vibrations.

00:14:15.458 --> 00:14:17.208
Even Nanaka did that.

00:14:17.417 --> 00:14:21.792
When Namadeva went down to Punjab,

00:14:21.999 --> 00:14:25.750
He told him, "Don't talk about God, don't talk about Hari,

00:14:25.959 --> 00:14:30.750
better talk about Paramachaitanya, first of all",

00:14:30.959 --> 00:14:34.000
because one can reach only Paramachaitanya to begin with

00:14:34.208 --> 00:14:37.917
and then they will say, "Where is God after all"?

00:14:38.083 --> 00:14:41.959
But it's only Christ who talked

00:14:42.125 --> 00:14:47.792
about God at that time when it was more,

00:14:47.999 --> 00:14:52.917
that they didn't want to talk about God Almighty.

00:14:53.083 --> 00:14:57.999
He was a daring person, was never afraid of anything, no doubt.

00:14:58.208 --> 00:15:03.083
But His childhood has not been described anywhere,

00:15:03.333 --> 00:15:04.709
which is very sad.

00:15:04.917 --> 00:15:09.125
We have got the beautiful description of Shri Krishna's childhood

00:15:09.333 --> 00:15:11.417
and also Shri Rama's childhood.

00:15:11.625 --> 00:15:16.917
Except that once He was in argument with some Pharisees,

00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:20.959
and how clever He was,

00:15:21.125 --> 00:15:26.208
and they were all flabbergasted at His discretion.

00:15:26.417 --> 00:15:31.375
That's all, nothing more. But later on,

00:15:31.583 --> 00:15:34.583
though that had shown no regard for Mary,

00:15:34.792 --> 00:15:36.208
the people couldn't help it. They said,

00:15:36.417 --> 00:15:38.875
"There has to be some Devi, some Goddess.

00:15:39.041 --> 00:15:42.250
How can Christ take birth from Her?"

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.291
So they named Her Madonna,

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:49.000
and that's how this Mother Mary was called as Madonna,

00:15:49.208 --> 00:15:51.709
means maiden, means virgin.

00:15:51.917 --> 00:15:56.792
And this Madonna was then started occupying

00:15:56.999 --> 00:16:00.959
the place of our churches everywhere,

00:16:01.125 --> 00:16:07.083
and people regarded Her as a, as a Goddess.

00:16:07.375 --> 00:16:10.917
It is the people who said, not in the Bible, not in the Christianity

00:16:11.083 --> 00:16:13.667
but the people start calling Her, Madonna,

00:16:13.875 --> 00:16:16.500
and from that Madonna level

00:16:16.709 --> 00:16:21.709
that people starting seeing the Mother

00:16:21.917 --> 00:16:23.792
and the motherhood.

00:16:23.999 --> 00:16:27.208
She was Mahalakshmi, we know that very well

00:16:27.417 --> 00:16:29.959
and we worship Her as Mahalakshmi.

00:16:30.125 --> 00:16:34.667
She was Radha. Radha also had a Son

00:16:34.875 --> 00:16:39.041
and He was like an egg

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:42.792
and a half of the egg was Christ

00:16:42.999 --> 00:16:47.000
and half of the egg was Shri Ganesh.

00:16:47.208 --> 00:16:52.333
But when this Child was born He started crying for His Father.

00:16:52.542 --> 00:16:56.125
Father was Shri Krishna.

00:16:56.917 --> 00:17:00.083
It's in the... if you read Devi Mahatmyam it is there.

00:17:00.291 --> 00:17:03.917
So always He puts His hands like this, towards His Father.

00:17:04.083 --> 00:17:06.999
So one is, as you know, is Shri Krishna's finger,

00:17:07.208 --> 00:17:10.875
another is Vishnu's.

00:17:11.041 --> 00:17:14.667
And She was Radha.

00:17:14.875 --> 00:17:19.542
Ra means energy, dha means the one who has sustained the energy.

00:17:19.792 --> 00:17:25.750
And She is the One, who called Him Jesus.

00:17:26.083 --> 00:17:30.333
Actually in the Hebrew it is Yesu

00:17:30.542 --> 00:17:33.709
and also in the - thank God I read Bible in Marathi,

00:17:33.917 --> 00:17:36.208
which was directly translated from Hebrew -

00:17:36.417 --> 00:17:38.375
Yesu is the name.

00:17:38.583 --> 00:17:42.792
Yesu is the name of the Mother of Christ,

00:17:42.999 --> 00:17:45.834
Mother of Shri Krishna.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.917
Yesu, means as we call Her

00:17:49.083 --> 00:17:52.291
Jesu or Yesu from Jesoda or Yeshoda.

00:17:52.542 --> 00:17:57.999
From that She called Him, and Christ word comes from Krishna.

00:17:58.166 --> 00:18:02.333
So She call Him Christ

00:18:02.625 --> 00:18:05.999
and Yesu or Jesus.

00:18:06.166 --> 00:18:10.542
We too call Yeshoda sometimes Jesu or Yesu.

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:13.083
So She called Him by that name

00:18:13.333 --> 00:18:19.166
and that is how She put the link for us to understand

00:18:19.375 --> 00:18:23.709
how close He was to Shri Krishna.

00:18:25.959 --> 00:18:30.208
Shri Krisha came only, incarnated only in India

00:18:30.417 --> 00:18:33.625
because He would have been

00:18:33.834 --> 00:18:37.291
too lenient person to be incarnated in America.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:43.041
As it is they have no limitations, they have no maryadas,

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:47.542
they have no idea of dharma, they are very great adharmis.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:51.458
So only a person like Christ

00:18:51.667 --> 00:18:57.333
who is absolutely pure, wise,

00:18:57.542 --> 00:19:00.999
and does not believe

00:19:01.166 --> 00:19:05.542
in the leela part of Shri Krishna.

00:19:05.792 --> 00:19:09.041
Is Shri Krishna said that is this all leela

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:14.583
to overcome the strictness of Shri Rama.

00:19:14.792 --> 00:19:17.792
But Christ did not said so

00:19:17.999 --> 00:19:23.500
and despite that, all over wherever Christianity is practiced,

00:19:23.709 --> 00:19:26.500
they think it's all leela, adharma is leela,

00:19:26.709 --> 00:19:29.917
whatever wrong we do is leela, after all, all innocent.

00:19:30.125 --> 00:19:32.792
It's surprising. Their logic is so funny

00:19:32.999 --> 00:19:35.625
I've never been able to understand their logic.

00:19:35.834 --> 00:19:39.417
All self-destructive, nonsensical logic they have.

00:19:39.625 --> 00:19:43.458
So, for us Indians, we should know that we have

00:19:43.667 --> 00:19:47.458
full idea of dharma. We know what is wrong and what is good.

00:19:47.667 --> 00:19:51.333
But more credit I would give to Christians,

00:19:51.542 --> 00:19:57.875
who are from such countries where they have no idea of Kundalini,

00:19:58.041 --> 00:20:00.583
have come up so much

00:20:00.792 --> 00:20:04.959
and have become such great Sahaja Yogis.

00:20:05.125 --> 00:20:07.250
Now is the blessing of God,

00:20:07.458 --> 00:20:11.250
because they were genuine, they were sincere.

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:16.875
It is Christ who brought them to Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:17.041 --> 00:20:19.834
Without Him it would not have been possible.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.999
Here Shri Ganesha is just a symbol, sort of a thing.

00:20:24.166 --> 00:20:27.542
He resides in the stones.

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:33.250
But there He incarnated and He told people what is dharma is,

00:20:33.458 --> 00:20:37.834
which they are supposed to follow, but they never follow.

00:20:38.041 --> 00:20:43.208
They never follow. They are extremely money oriented people.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:49.500
Is very surprising what things they have done in the name of God.

00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:54.041
The most symbolic thing is His birth.

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:58.250
He was born in a manger,

00:20:58.458 --> 00:21:01.125
just imagine, in a manger,

00:21:01.333 --> 00:21:05.834
full of straws assembled together

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.166
this child was born,

00:21:08.375 --> 00:21:12.875
where there were other animals used to be.

00:21:13.041 --> 00:21:16.999
See the way

00:21:17.208 --> 00:21:19.959
this great incarnation took birth.

00:21:20.166 --> 00:21:26.041
He was not king, he was not a big rich man,

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:30.750
He was born as a very poor person

00:21:30.999 --> 00:21:36.917
and in a place which is something very much

00:21:37.083 --> 00:21:40.750
below the human standard.

00:21:40.959 --> 00:21:44.999
This message is, that you don't need palaces,

00:21:45.166 --> 00:21:47.875
you don't need huge places to be born,

00:21:48.041 --> 00:21:52.291
you can be born anywhere, if you are a pure Spirit,

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.917
if you are Christ.

00:21:54.083 --> 00:21:57.875
Such a great personality was born like that.

00:21:58.083 --> 00:22:00.792
Now the other way round people go.

00:22:00.999 --> 00:22:05.166
They are extremely money oriented, very materialistic.

00:22:05.375 --> 00:22:07.333
I mean to such a limit

00:22:07.542 --> 00:22:11.125
that you can't understand what  are they up to.

00:22:11.333 --> 00:22:14.792
They are destroying themselves with whatever money they have made,

00:22:14.999 --> 00:22:17.291
they have no sense, they have no proportion.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.999
This is what is happening in the West,

00:22:20.166 --> 00:22:23.000
and we are trying to follow them also.

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:26.250
We are trying to follow their destructive methods

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:30.542
and we are trying to think that we are very advanced.

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:34.166
Advanced towards doom, that's what they are.

00:22:34.375 --> 00:22:37.333
We have to be very careful with our children,

00:22:37.542 --> 00:22:40.999
with our relations, that we don't go to their dirty things

00:22:41.166 --> 00:22:44.417
and take to their dirty ways,

00:22:44.625 --> 00:22:50.208
which they have created in the name of God, in the name of God.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:57.500
Now this group that we have here, is quite a large group,

00:22:58.166 --> 00:23:00.709
and we are Sahaja Yogis

00:23:00.917 --> 00:23:02.750
we are all blessed people,

00:23:02.959 --> 00:23:05.458
we know what is Divinity is

00:23:05.667 --> 00:23:08.250
and we know what Christ is.

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:14.375
Whether you are born Hindu or anything, makes no difference,

00:23:14.583 --> 00:23:16.625
because Christ is universal.

00:23:16.834 --> 00:23:18.250
He's the support of universe,

00:23:18.458 --> 00:23:21.083
that's what is written in Devi Mahatmyam

00:23:21.291 --> 00:23:24.875
ki ("that" in Hindi) He will be the support of the universe.

00:23:25.041 --> 00:23:27.667
So one has to understand

00:23:27.875 --> 00:23:32.625
that we should never ridicule anybody, if he is following Christ

00:23:32.834 --> 00:23:37.500
and that we should worship Him with the same affection,

00:23:37.709 --> 00:23:41.750
with the same devotion, with the same surrendering,

00:23:41.959 --> 00:23:45.208
as we worship Shri Ganesh.

00:23:45.417 --> 00:23:47.792
Because I don't think Christians

00:23:47.999 --> 00:23:52.375
have any faith about Christ, no faith.

00:23:52.583 --> 00:23:55.375
They are, "We believe in Christ, we believe in Christ.

00:23:55.583 --> 00:23:59.667
You cure my father, do this, do that".

00:23:59.999 --> 00:24:04.166
But as Sahaja Yogis' faith works.

00:24:04.417 --> 00:24:07.792
Your faith is an enlightened faith and it works.

00:24:07.999 --> 00:24:11.625
But you must have faith in yourself, in Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:11.834 --> 00:24:14.125
and in the life you are leading.

00:24:14.333 --> 00:24:16.250
Unless and until this happens to you

00:24:16.458 --> 00:24:19.041
you shouldn't call yourself a Sahaja Yogi.

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:22.750
I see, still there are people on the periphery.

00:24:22.959 --> 00:24:25.208
Then you don't know what to do about it,

00:24:25.417 --> 00:24:28.959
you don't understand in a mental way,

00:24:29.125 --> 00:24:34.041
but you just float into the immense love of God

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:37.792
and you want to give this love to others.

00:24:37.999 --> 00:24:42.583
But still, materialism becomes subtler with some people.

00:24:42.792 --> 00:24:44.792
They are still materialistic.

00:24:44.999 --> 00:24:46.750
They are materialistic in the sense,

00:24:46.959 --> 00:24:51.999
they still think of earning in a bad way some money or something.

00:24:52.208 --> 00:24:54.458
Maybe, but that is not so common.

00:24:54.667 --> 00:24:56.583
But I feel they are now

00:24:56.792 --> 00:25:00.000
suddenly started getting attached to their children.

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:03.834
This attachment is very wrong.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.959
You see, children belong to Sahaja Yoga. You have no right on them.

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:14.542
Because they straight away wanted children to come back home

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:17.792
and not to come to Ganapatipule.

00:25:17.999 --> 00:25:22.583
Means they are children of Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:22.792 --> 00:25:26.166
They have to come to Ganapatipule, no question.

00:25:26.375 --> 00:25:29.625
But they wanted to take over their children directly.

00:25:29.834 --> 00:25:32.542
Everything is there, directly done.

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:34.999
Is not, children are not here for that.

00:25:35.166 --> 00:25:38.166
They are here to grow in Sahaja Yoga. If you don't want

00:25:38.375 --> 00:25:40.917
your children to grow in Sahaja Yoga, better take them away.

00:25:41.125 --> 00:25:43.792
But this is not the way to behave arbitrarily,

00:25:43.999 --> 00:25:46.083
to take the children away from the school,

00:25:46.291 --> 00:25:48.208
when everybody is coming to Ganapatipule.

00:25:48.417 --> 00:25:50.625
And I'm sure children don't like it.

00:25:50.834 --> 00:25:53.041
They would love to be here.

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:56.000
So the materialism in the sense of children,

00:25:56.208 --> 00:26:01.667
also saving money part is working out.

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:04.959
And this is, something shows the materialism,

00:26:05.125 --> 00:26:10.375
which Christ never, never clung to.

00:26:10.625 --> 00:26:13.750
He never wanted it.

00:26:16.166 --> 00:26:18.667
This one we have to understand.

00:26:18.875 --> 00:26:22.083
To pay respect to Christ the best thing

00:26:22.291 --> 00:26:24.959
is to get out of this materialistic ideas.

00:26:25.125 --> 00:26:28.000
All right, you have materialistic ideas

00:26:28.208 --> 00:26:32.041
as far as I don't say that you don't go to Himalayas,

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:36.999
I don't say that you go to, you,

00:26:37.208 --> 00:26:38.834
you practice asceticism,

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.125
I don't say take away, give up your children, like Buddha did.

00:26:42.333 --> 00:26:43.917
Nothing of the kind.

00:26:44.083 --> 00:26:48.625
But your detachment should work.

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:55.041
There's a, say a bird is there, flying over the ocean of water.

00:26:55.250 --> 00:27:00.125
It will never drink the water of the ocean, because it is saltish.

00:27:00.333 --> 00:27:03.500
You are there, you are in this world,

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:06.583
but you must develop your detachment.

00:27:06.792 --> 00:27:08.999
In the beginning it was all right, "my father is sick",

00:27:09.166 --> 00:27:10.999
"my mother is sick", "my child is like this",

00:27:11.166 --> 00:27:14.333
all this nonsense was all right. But not now.

00:27:14.542 --> 00:27:17.500
Now the speed of Sahaja Yoga is very fast

00:27:17.709 --> 00:27:21.959
and those will be left behind, will be left behind. So be careful.

00:27:22.125 --> 00:27:27.625
Do not get entangled into these materialistic ideas.

00:27:29.208 --> 00:27:33.625
And for Indians especially, they don't like to stay in ashrams.

00:27:33.834 --> 00:27:37.208
Indians want to have their homes, so they can dominate their wives,

00:27:37.417 --> 00:27:41.999
have their special type of food, this, that, and

00:27:42.166 --> 00:27:48.125
work out all their ugly tastes all the time.

00:27:48.792 --> 00:27:51.250
I would say that's must be the reason people must have said

00:27:51.458 --> 00:27:57.458
that Indians must fast, to get rid of their tongues, desires.

00:27:59.667 --> 00:28:04.291
They will, even when fast, think about food, what's the use?

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.625
Christ fasted for forty days

00:28:06.834 --> 00:28:10.375
and Satan asked Him that, "You should give up Your fast

00:28:10.583 --> 00:28:15.041
and do this and do that". He never listened.

00:28:16.917 --> 00:28:21.583
So materialism works out in two types.

00:28:21.917 --> 00:28:26.208
First of all in the West now is the materialism is "my house",

00:28:26.417 --> 00:28:31.083
"my wife", "my children", this that.

00:28:31.709 --> 00:28:35.542
And in the East is, "what sort of a food I eat",

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:38.625
"what sort of a house I should have",

00:28:38.834 --> 00:28:44.083
"what sort of a family I should have?"

00:28:45.417 --> 00:28:48.500
All these things are still lingering.

00:28:48.709 --> 00:28:52.417
As your ascent has become subtler

00:28:52.625 --> 00:28:55.583
they are also becoming subtler and subtler.

00:28:55.792 --> 00:28:57.792
And they are holding you back.

00:28:57.999 --> 00:29:01.792
There are all kinds of things. For example I know of Sahaja Yogis,

00:29:01.999 --> 00:29:06.875
who want to make business out of Sahaja Yoga, there are.

00:29:07.041 --> 00:29:08.875
Like these people here, outside,

00:29:09.041 --> 00:29:11.834
they want to sell their things to us

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.041
and to make money out of this.

00:29:15.291 --> 00:29:17.458
There was a demand that there were no saris.

00:29:17.667 --> 00:29:21.542
I said, "All right, take saris. But you are not to buy from outside".

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:23.709
Also they will go to some shop here,

00:29:23.917 --> 00:29:26.917
and have something to drink, or something to eat,

00:29:27.083 --> 00:29:30.125
and then suffer from something.

00:29:30.333 --> 00:29:35.125
What is the need? Can you not control your thirst?

00:29:35.333 --> 00:29:40.125
Can you not control your appetite?

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:45.166
It's very easy. Did He not do it? Christ did it.

00:29:45.458 --> 00:29:47.417
You have come here to worship Him.

00:29:47.625 --> 00:29:50.583
Try to control these things are very important,

00:29:50.792 --> 00:29:53.583
and once it happens,

00:29:53.834 --> 00:29:56.834
it doesn't matter if you get food, doesn't matter,

00:29:56.999 --> 00:30:00.125
if you don't get some good place to live in.

00:30:00.333 --> 00:30:03.834
You can live anywhere, anywhere.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.417
As far as I am concerned, you know that very well.

00:30:08.625 --> 00:30:12.542
I have no demands. I have, I mean My body doesn't demand anything.

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:16.917
Is such a good body. Never demands.

00:30:17.083 --> 00:30:22.709
And that's why I have seen, that I never feel tired.

00:30:22.917 --> 00:30:28.375
I am here with you and in the same way I am anywhere.

00:30:28.625 --> 00:30:31.458
If you make Me sleep here I can sleep the whole night.

00:30:31.667 --> 00:30:34.999
My body never says anything.

00:30:35.208 --> 00:30:38.917
On the contrary I've seen the experience is very different.

00:30:39.083 --> 00:30:41.166
Once I travelled by train,

00:30:41.375 --> 00:30:44.709
I think from Pune to Hyderabad or something,

00:30:44.917 --> 00:30:46.999
and the train - I was on the wheel -

00:30:47.166 --> 00:30:50.250
and the thing was jumping, jumping, jumping all the time.

00:30:50.458 --> 00:30:52.999
I slept off and what I was feeling,

00:30:53.208 --> 00:30:56.583
that I am going from one star to another star,

00:30:56.792 --> 00:30:58.375
moving from the whole universe.

00:30:58.583 --> 00:31:01.500
I never felt the jump, I felt the other way round,

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:04.208
that the whole thing is going, the body is moving

00:31:04.417 --> 00:31:06.667
from this star to that star, from there to there.

00:31:06.875 --> 00:31:12.166
I mean somebody would be absolutely angry for a thing like that.

00:31:12.375 --> 00:31:15.208
On the contrary, I was enjoying, nice jumping from here to there

00:31:15.417 --> 00:31:17.500
to go into this star and to that star and

00:31:17.709 --> 00:31:21.917
moving from one place to another. It was very interesting.

00:31:22.083 --> 00:31:24.583
So the reaction is very different.

00:31:24.792 --> 00:31:27.959
Reaction is different. If there is a crisis,

00:31:28.125 --> 00:31:31.625
suddenly I become thoughtless, completely thoughtless.

00:31:31.834 --> 00:31:37.625
And a kind of a tremendous peace starts pouring out of it.

00:31:38.041 --> 00:31:40.625
If there is a crisis.

00:31:40.834 --> 00:31:44.041
And this is what you all can achieve very simply,

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:47.834
if you get detached.

00:31:48.125 --> 00:31:49.917
See, I have children, I have grandchildren.

00:31:50.083 --> 00:31:51.625
I never telephone to them.

00:31:51.834 --> 00:31:54.999
I'm not bothered. If they telephone, well and good.

00:31:55.166 --> 00:31:57.583
I never telephone to my husband also.

00:31:57.792 --> 00:32:02.041
I always think that it's a waste of time.

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:04.208
of telephoning here and telephoning...

00:32:04.417 --> 00:32:06.333
I've got all telephones within Myself.

00:32:06.542 --> 00:32:10.250
I know everybody is all right so why to telephone to them.

00:32:10.458 --> 00:32:14.583
But unless and until you develop that kind of status it won't [work].

00:32:14.792 --> 00:32:17.709
Then another thing I've noticed about Sahaja Yogis

00:32:17.917 --> 00:32:19.709
that they become suddenly very violent

00:32:19.917 --> 00:32:23.291
and there are reports that some people were hit.

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:26.709
That's not being a Sahaja Yogi at all.

00:32:26.917 --> 00:32:30.875
I've never raise My hand against even My own children.

00:32:31.041 --> 00:32:34.667
It's not allowed. Nobody has to raise the hand

00:32:34.917 --> 00:32:37.333
or touch somebody's body to be violent.

00:32:37.542 --> 00:32:41.500
It's absolutely, such a person will fall very deep down,

00:32:41.709 --> 00:32:44.834
into Sahaja Yoga, without doing anything.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.999
You are not to get angry, you are not to shout.

00:32:48.166 --> 00:32:51.542
Nothing of the kind is going to help you.

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:55.291
You have to be absolutely peaceful, calm, compassionate.

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:59.999
If there is a wrong type of a man, just tell Me, I'll manage.

00:33:00.166 --> 00:33:04.041
You don't have to handle such situations and misbehave,

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:08.792
because you are still attached,

00:33:08.999 --> 00:33:11.583
and that attachment will pull you down.

00:33:11.875 --> 00:33:14.792
So be careful, not to be angry.

00:33:14.999 --> 00:33:16.917
Look at Christ!

00:33:17.083 --> 00:33:19.750
He was angry with the people who were selling things

00:33:19.959 --> 00:33:23.083
near the church - you know, that time it was not the church,

00:33:23.333 --> 00:33:25.166
but they called it a tabernacle.

00:33:25.375 --> 00:33:29.166
And He was very angry, that in the temple of God,

00:33:29.375 --> 00:33:31.750
these people are selling things outside,

00:33:31.959 --> 00:33:35.583
and He took a big hunter and hit them hard. But He was Christ.

00:33:35.792 --> 00:33:38.917
But at the same time, when He was crucified,

00:33:39.083 --> 00:33:42.583
He said, "Oh God, My Father, please forgive them,

00:33:42.792 --> 00:33:46.792
because they don't know what they are doing".

00:33:47.417 --> 00:33:51.333
This is what is, one has to understand from Him.

00:33:51.542 --> 00:33:55.166
His character, how forgiving, how loving He was.

00:33:55.375 --> 00:33:57.542
How He looked after the people,

00:33:57.750 --> 00:34:01.333
how He helped people for their emancipation.

00:34:01.542 --> 00:34:05.000
In those days of complete chaos

00:34:05.208 --> 00:34:08.542
and anarchy,

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:14.709
He stood up and talked about truth and about

00:34:14.999 --> 00:34:20.667
such things like Spirit, like ascent.

00:34:20.875 --> 00:34:22.959
I mean, they were all blind people.

00:34:23.125 --> 00:34:25.959
They didn't know what it was He was talking about.

00:34:26.125 --> 00:34:28.667
And He talked about it.

00:34:28.875 --> 00:34:33.375
There is lot of myths that exist in the Bible,

00:34:33.583 --> 00:34:38.917
and one of them is that when the Resurrection time will come

00:34:39.083 --> 00:34:42.041
your bodies will come out of your graves.

00:34:42.291 --> 00:34:47.083
It is not only with Christianity, but also with the Muslims

00:34:47.291 --> 00:34:50.458
and also for the Jews.

00:34:50.667 --> 00:34:56.000
Now think of it, after so many years, what remains in the,

00:34:56.208 --> 00:35:00.625
in the graves? Few bones.

00:35:00.834 --> 00:35:02.917
And these few bones if they come out,

00:35:03.083 --> 00:35:05.792
how can you give them Realization?

00:35:05.999 --> 00:35:08.458
Think of it. It's a big myth.

00:35:08.667 --> 00:35:11.083
One should understand, logically is not proper.

00:35:11.291 --> 00:35:13.792
So what is the thing is, I must say,

00:35:13.999 --> 00:35:15.959
in Nal-Damyanti Akhiyan

00:35:16.125 --> 00:35:19.000
in Indian philosophy they have given a clear-cut idea,

00:35:19.208 --> 00:35:21.458
that when this Kali Yuga will come,

00:35:21.667 --> 00:35:24.999
so many great seekers who are seeking God

00:35:25.166 --> 00:35:31.166
in the hills and dales, mountains,

00:35:31.417 --> 00:35:33.291
will be born again

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:36.458
and they will be given their Self Realization.

00:35:36.667 --> 00:35:38.542
Their Kundalini will be awaken.

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:41.333
This is what is said and that seems to be

00:35:41.583 --> 00:35:44.500
a very logical thing, because we are doing that.

00:35:44.709 --> 00:35:46.792
And today's population growth is also because

00:35:46.999 --> 00:35:48.750
so many have taken birth.

00:35:48.959 --> 00:35:51.792
I don't know how many will get their Self Realization,

00:35:51.999 --> 00:35:53.792
how many they are going to get it.

00:35:53.999 --> 00:35:55.500
But those who have got it

00:35:55.709 --> 00:35:59.542
have to establish themselves, establish themselves.

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:03.500
And there also I find there's some sort of a very

00:36:03.709 --> 00:36:07.959
subtle type of attachment with people.

00:36:08.625 --> 00:36:12.041
So for the time being I feel

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:16.625
that you should all surrender yourself to the qualities of Christ,

00:36:16.834 --> 00:36:18.709
which are immense qualities.

00:36:18.917 --> 00:36:21.250
And the greatest is that He cannot tolerate

00:36:21.458 --> 00:36:23.750
anything against the Holy Ghost.

00:36:23.959 --> 00:36:27.375
That is the only time He is going to come out and work it.

00:36:27.583 --> 00:36:31.500
I tell you, if you are a Sahaja Yogi and if you misbehave,

00:36:31.709 --> 00:36:33.875
He allows you to some extent.

00:36:34.041 --> 00:36:36.375
But there's one fellow in America

00:36:36.583 --> 00:36:40.417
wanted to talk to Me on the telephone and discuss about Sahaja Yoga,

00:36:40.625 --> 00:36:43.125
but he found Me a bit too much for him, perhaps,

00:36:43.333 --> 00:36:46.166
and he started talking to Sahaja Yogis and he wouldn't,

00:36:46.375 --> 00:36:48.000
he didn't talk to Me.

00:36:48.208 --> 00:36:51.041
And everybody was very angry. I said, "Forget it".

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:52.959
The other day I received a message

00:36:53.125 --> 00:36:55.999
that he was doing a program same type

00:36:56.166 --> 00:37:01.250
and he collapsed, because he got paralysis.

00:37:01.834 --> 00:37:05.417
So he is not a Sahaja Yogi. I am not responsible.

00:37:05.625 --> 00:37:09.625
But if somebody calls Me a Mother then

00:37:09.834 --> 00:37:11.834
the Paramchaitanya respects that way.

00:37:11.999 --> 00:37:14.417
And you have no business to hit anybody

00:37:14.625 --> 00:37:17.542
or to talk to anyone rudely, in any manner,

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:19.250
those who are Sahaja Yogis.

00:37:19.458 --> 00:37:21.625
Of course if you want to tell somebody off

00:37:21.834 --> 00:37:24.625
there are ways how this should be done, like a Sahaja Yoga way

00:37:24.834 --> 00:37:27.250
and not like the violent things.

00:37:27.458 --> 00:37:30.959
It's very, very wrong and I'm very upset to hear that people

00:37:31.125 --> 00:37:35.458
suddenly become violent, even now in Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:37.417 --> 00:37:38.999
This comes from liver, I know.

00:37:39.166 --> 00:37:42.583
You can go in for your liver treatment, improve yourself,

00:37:42.792 --> 00:37:48.208
but don't think that you can get away with it. You cannot.

00:37:48.417 --> 00:37:51.667
Is better such people fast for two days

00:37:51.875 --> 00:37:54.125
and punish themselves.

00:37:54.333 --> 00:37:56.375
Temper is the worst thing

00:37:56.583 --> 00:38:00.792
and Shri Krishna has told that temper is the worst

00:38:00.999 --> 00:38:03.000
from where everything starts.

00:38:03.208 --> 00:38:07.583
So we must control our temper and understand

00:38:07.792 --> 00:38:13.625
that Christ was the embodiment of forgiveness, embodiment.

00:38:13.834 --> 00:38:15.999
We are worshiping Him today.

00:38:16.208 --> 00:38:19.166
How He forgave people?

00:38:19.375 --> 00:38:22.458
Those who crucified were not the Jews actually.

00:38:22.667 --> 00:38:26.458
They were the Romans. The Roman authorities crucified Him.

00:38:26.667 --> 00:38:30.166
But Paul decided that we should try to condemn the Jews,

00:38:30.375 --> 00:38:34.709
"So the Jews have done it". Jews have not done it.

00:38:34.917 --> 00:38:38.583
And they condemned Jews forever.

00:38:39.208 --> 00:38:44.667
With this kind of an attitude people hated Jews,

00:38:44.875 --> 00:38:47.834
and they troubled them and they were tortured.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.917
Then Jews also had a reaction. They are equally the same.

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:56.000
So is not the Jews, because is never done

00:38:56.208 --> 00:38:59.709
that you ask a multitude, a magistrate asks the multitude,

00:38:59.917 --> 00:39:04.208
whether you should crucify a thief or this man.

00:39:04.417 --> 00:39:07.041
It's never done. They have to take their own decisions.

00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:08.291
This is never done.

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:13.250
So this is just to bring a curse on the Jews.

00:39:13.583 --> 00:39:16.125
This Paul has done the greatest harm.

00:39:16.333 --> 00:39:19.709
But now, thank God, may we have many Jews and we have

00:39:19.917 --> 00:39:24.375
also a center in Israel, is working out all over.

00:39:24.583 --> 00:39:28.917
We have lots of people from Iran who have come to America,

00:39:29.083 --> 00:39:33.834
who are also Jews and who are also Muslims,

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.750
they all have taken to Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:36.959 --> 00:39:39.917
So it is something that's happening

00:39:40.083 --> 00:39:46.041
and also the Sufi people from Turkey I hear, are joining us

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:51.583
and also Sufi people from India, we'll be able to get them.

00:39:51.834 --> 00:39:56.792
So thus it will work out and it will work out for everybody's good.

00:39:56.999 --> 00:40:01.500
But first of all we should understand how Christ was

00:40:01.709 --> 00:40:05.875
and how His life was and how He loved the world.

00:40:06.041 --> 00:40:10.041
He came on this earth to be crucified.

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:15.041
He knew He was to be crucified and He did it.

00:40:15.542 --> 00:40:21.542
The way they have given His picture is not correct.

00:40:21.999 --> 00:40:25.999
He was a very healthy, hefty, tall person.

00:40:26.166 --> 00:40:30.041
He had to carry that cross. Those people who paint Him,

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:33.583
like a Tb patient, should know that they

00:40:33.792 --> 00:40:37.834
if they have to carry the cross, can they do it?

00:40:38.166 --> 00:40:41.208
So all sorts of things they have done

00:40:41.417 --> 00:40:45.083
to harm His personality, to assassinate His character.

00:40:45.291 --> 00:40:47.999
But you being Sahaja Yogis should know about Him,

00:40:48.166 --> 00:40:51.625
and must have full respect, full faith in Him.

00:40:51.834 --> 00:40:53.750
And He is your eldest brother.

00:40:53.959 --> 00:40:58.125
As Shri Ganesha is, He incarnates as your elder brother.

00:40:58.333 --> 00:41:02.500
He's there to look after you in every trouble, in every kind

00:41:02.709 --> 00:41:05.083
of a turmoil.

00:41:05.291 --> 00:41:10.625
He is going to help us in every way, all the time,

00:41:10.834 --> 00:41:16.166
and only way is to surrender, to forgive.

00:41:16.417 --> 00:41:21.333
That is the quality of Christ we have to imbibe.

00:41:21.542 --> 00:41:24.542
May God bless you all!
