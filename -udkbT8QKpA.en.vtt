00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.790
We have sometimes heard about people who get
a hunch.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:18.980
Like somebody says, “I must buy this house,
I get a hunch that I should buy it."

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:27.730
Or sometimes people say that, “I always
hear something, somebody tells me that this

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.850
should not be done."

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:46.710
But all such suggestions must be judged that
they come to you to tell you about something

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:57.469
of the beyond or something that concerns the
mundane life, like buying a house.

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:07.439
God is not interested, very much, in what
house you buy, or how much money you make

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.100
in a race: He is not!

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.389
Because it is not important to God.

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:14.810
One can understand that, isn’t it.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.070
Also that God is not interested in telling
you against someone in the ear that, “Beware

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.240
of this man, he is a dangerous guy!”

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:35.450
For, if somebody is going to harm you physically,
maybe to some part, we can say that God wants

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:43.759
to preserve your body; but this body is also
not so important to God, because He can create

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.169
it again!

00:01:47.169 --> 00:02:06.099
The most important thing that God has to give
us is His love, His connection with us, His

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:11.410
Kingdom, His powers.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:19.840
So, the subtleties which we should really
accept within us, should be [those] which

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:30.300
take you to the realm of joy, to the realm
of collectivity.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:37.980
Like suddenly you see a little child weeping
on the street and you feel [that] your heart

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:38.980
is weeping.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:46.819
Not that you feel guilty about it but you
feel one with the child and you feel you are

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:55.569
weeping: then definitely that subtlety of
compassion that God is, is felt within you.

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:03.620
But you don’t feel guilty about it, or you
don’t give him 2p (£0.02) or something

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.290
to insult his ego.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:14.019
You do something very constructive about it,
extremely constructive, and you do it secretly;

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:21.040
you don’t like to tell anybody about it
because you think it is vulgar to talk about

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.849
your compassion.

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:29.459
You do it so sweetly that the other fellow
doesn’t feel it.

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:38.420
The whole act is such a beautifying thing.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.200
You don’t announce it in the paper and you
don’t publish it in “Who’s Who” or

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:51.249
you do not go for a Nobel Prize or something
like that.

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:58.459
This is all very vulgar for the Subtle Thing
that you worship within yourself, because

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:07.739
that element within you is so much higher
than all these gross considerations that you

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.830
just care for that.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.170
That is what God is.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:19.019
That’s how God shines within us, even before
our Realisation, before our connection with

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.289
God.

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:28.740
He shines in some people even before they
have been Realised.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:40.180
You see them, they are quiet people, they
are not show-offs, but they are very sincere,

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.330
extremely kind-hearted.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:53.000
Such people when they face Sahaja Yoga, immediately
they get their vibrations.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.389
They are not people who are worried about
money, or they are worried about the gross

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:13.400
things of life, or achievements that are so
stupid.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.940
Such people may exist as very ordinary people;
they need not be at the helm of affairs [and]

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.629
mostly they are not, because they are not
ambitious.

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:25.440
They do not want much success in life.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.850
They don’t see any point in being very successful.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.660
They might be something very ordinary.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.500
They might be doing something very important
also.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:50.349
But in their life, those who come in contact
with them, remember that: “Yes!

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:54.669
There was a life or there is a life.

00:05:54.669 --> 00:06:02.840
Definitely there is a spark."

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:10.630
Because such a person being so subtle does
not assert.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:17.909
Such a person cannot be very dominating, assertive,
argumentative.

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:33.159
Such a person is quieter: his attention recedes
from all quarrels and all squabbles of life.

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:42.380
But such a person has a great position in
the domain of God.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:57.819
That you have seen, how in Sahaja Yoga suddenly
you find people manifesting their divinity.

00:06:57.819 --> 00:07:03.970
Maybe such a person is too naïve for all
practical purposes.

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:12.330
He might have been cheated, might have been
misled by some horrible people who try to

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:18.610
exploit his seeking, but still it remains.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:29.500
This element suddenly gets ignited in Sahaja
Yoga and for such a person this is the most

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:39.360
important thing: is to feel that Being which
always kept him away from all the rest of

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:50.819
the ideologies and ‘great’ things and
have always given him strength and confidence

00:07:50.819 --> 00:07:51.819
and joy.

00:07:51.819 --> 00:07:56.699
He sees that clearly in Sahaj Yog.

00:07:56.699 --> 00:07:58.669
He adheres to it.

00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:05.400
And when he nourishes it, he’s amazed that
he has found himself.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:10.719
Then it becomes his life.

00:08:10.719 --> 00:08:23.669
There are thousands and thousands of people
everywhere.

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:28.510
I say ‘thousands’, I don’t say ‘millions’.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:32.580
I am sorry, because they are not in millions.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.100
I am sorry for that.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.110
I wish they were.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:47.030
They could be counted in thousands only: maybe
twenty-one thousand, altogether, of that quality.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:51.610
There won’t be millions.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:54.710
But they will be making millions later on.

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:57.530
They have to be a few!

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:04.860
These are people of special calibre as I said.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:11.970
But it is necessary that everybody must be
given Self-realisation, every seed must be

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:12.970
germinated.

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:20.980
But how many would sprout into the trees and
would render fruit is a different point altogether.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:28.070
First and foremost thing is that, first let
them all be germinated.

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:33.920
In due course, all those would come back.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:47.190
But some would prosper into their complete
manifestation, in their full bloom in a very

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:51.920
short time, and that’s what matters the
most.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:57.220
The Divine is not interested in useless people,
It is interested in that special calibre.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:06.230
As I have told you: such a person may not
be at all rich, may be absolutely poor.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.980
That doesn’t mean that rich cannot be so!

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:12.560
[They] can be very rich also.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:19.820
The outward appearances and status and all
these denominations do not matter at all.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:24.480
I am talking of the spark inside.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:34.090
They can be called as gentlemen, in simple
words, or if she is [female], a lady .

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:44.960
A serene dignity manifests through their being.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:49.840
Sometimes it happens with their lives, also,
that they find it very difficult to keep to

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:59.080
the norms of the mad world, and they may be
a little cynical sometimes, could be.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:07.370
But cynicism is not that subtlety, but they
may appear to people a little cynical.

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:16.060
But they have to be very delightful and extremely
cheerful people.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:23.540
They cannot be morose, sad, emitting unhappiness
all around, and big bores with a B capital

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:27.160
and O capital, R and E, all capital.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.370
That cannot be possible.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:34.120
They are extremely enjoyable and magnetic
and dynamic.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:45.010
They are complete in themselves because they
feel their subtlety, they live on that.

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:55.020
Still their seeking is there, and the meaning
they try to find to their own being.

00:11:55.020 --> 00:12:00.720
And they want to identify their subtlety with
something that is universal.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:10.940
In their expression in any field that they
are, they appeal to the Universal Being within

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.400
every one of us.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:25.510
Maybe, they may not get a Nobel Prize, but
[they have] a personality that emits that

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:29.510
kind of congenial behaviour.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:37.640
Now if somebody is a person who is absolutely
satanic, he will abhor such a person, possibly.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:47.980
But this does not concern to the subtler being
because he is at a level which is not tarnished

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:54.920
by gross attacks.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:13:02.900
That is what one has to recognise in oneself
and one should feel very proud and fortunate

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.260
that that exists within us.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:11.790
No more one has to feel lonely, because now
we are so many of us, of the same creed and

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:14.120
the same type.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:22.070
And so many of us who have found out what
is the reason, what expresses it, what manifests

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:38.610
it within us, what are the Deities that govern
this subtlety within us: what you may call

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:47.120
the archetype images; archetype images are
there which are real, not imaginary, within

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.180
us.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:55.610
And all these discoveries, then make you feel
confident of all these vague subtleties you

00:13:55.610 --> 00:14:01.120
have been enjoying so far.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:16.610
A long time back, I had given a simile like
this: that a mother bird puts the little child,

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:20.970
or you can call, the baby bird, away from
her.

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:34.390
And the baby bird feels the mother’s warmth,
and she wants that.

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:38.910
And she is calling for the mother.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:44.140
That calling itself is the last thing it knows
of.

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:48.710
That’s the highest thing for the baby bird,
nothing else matters.

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:53.980
You may give anything to the baby bird [but]
it won’t be happy, it needs that.

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:59.410
It needs that warmth, that love.

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:07.000
And then it expresses itself by spreading
its tiny little wings around and tries to

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.800
hop and to express it.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:18.640
And then out of complete joy of its hopping,
the mother bird herself comes down and engulfs

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:26.940
that child into the wings, giving all the
warmth necessary.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:39.990
It is that happening within us which takes
place when the Kundalini rises.

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:52.570
The Kundalini is the part of that warmth within
us, of that compassion.

00:15:52.570 --> 00:16:06.970
It’s a part of that beauty, it’s the part
of that desire.

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:08.630
Desire…

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.850
What’s the matter?

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:14.060
The door is open or not.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:19.010
Come in, come in!

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:40.630
They are waiting because they [don’t want
to disturb].

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:41.630
What’s the matter?

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:42.630
Yogi: Sorry we’re late Shri Mataji.

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:43.630
Shri Mataji: No, it’s all right.

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:44.630
Come in!

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.760
So the desire of God is placed within us as
Kundalini.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:17:02.990
And when all the external desires dim out
within us and the real desire to be one with

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:13.000
the Almighty remains, the Kundalini can rise
spontaneously.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:21.110
That has happened to few people, very few
people: you can say like Buddha, Mahavira.

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:34.320
These people were human beings and they achieved
godliness: not by forcing yourself to get

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:47.750
rid of your desires, but through wisdom, understanding
that, “This is stupidity, this is foolishness.

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:51.129
Where am I going?”

00:17:51.129 --> 00:17:54.379
Just the wisdom acting.

00:17:54.379 --> 00:18:05.139
Not a rational understanding, but the being
itself rejecting.

00:18:05.139 --> 00:18:11.309
Such stages are achieved through one’s own
evolutionary forces.

00:18:11.309 --> 00:18:28.750
Also, there are so many other happenings,
or the other supports, which bring forth this

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:33.860
kind of spontaneous rising of the Kundalini.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:40.520
There is somebody who wants to come and see
me because he said, “Mother you are an authority

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:52.740
on Kundalini and there are many books written
about Kundalini, and I have to write a criticism:

00:18:52.740 --> 00:19:01.360
that the Kundalini, when she rises, you start
jumping and when she rises she gives you heat,

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:09.009
or you burn off yourself or you jump through
the roof or something like that."

00:19:09.009 --> 00:19:18.190
All sorts of horrifying things and nobody
wants to listen to anything about Kundalini.

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:20.410
If you read those books, you’ll be really
frightened.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:27.039
I think it is absolutely satanic.

00:19:27.039 --> 00:19:33.950
And he wants to know about the ‘authentic
description’ of Kundalini.

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:48.899
And I told him that, “These books, all of
them, should be thrown away into the sea!

00:19:48.899 --> 00:19:57.490
Because they are written by people who have
had no experience of Kundalini, of any kind."

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:07.790
Because they were people who must have been
doing some sort of an ‘adventure’ somewhere.

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:16.929
Like some people believe that even finding
of God is another job: if you have no job,

00:20:16.929 --> 00:20:22.570
better find God, at least He might help you
to survive!

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:35.820
Some people do believe that instead of sitting
idle, why not try to find God, would be a

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:38.809
good idea.

00:20:38.809 --> 00:20:48.070
And when such a thing happens and they venture
into the search of God then, first, they are

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:56.029
hit by The Guard of Holiness.

00:20:56.029 --> 00:21:03.520
Because they are not entitled, they are not
holy, they have no protocol about God Almighty,

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:07.730
they have no respect, they are just doing
it because they are ego-oriented, they want

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:14.440
to have another ego-trip and they want to
become ‘great explorers’ of Kundalini.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:20.039
But you cannot do it.

00:21:20.039 --> 00:21:23.600
You have to have proper protocol.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:41.420
They lack all humility, all holiness, righteousness
and all that is needed, to ask the help of

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:43.769
the Kundalini.

00:21:43.769 --> 00:21:51.360
And they are hit by the first Deity, which
sits in the triangular bone, which they can

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:57.710
also see sometimes — they have seen him,
with a temper; in red colour, they call it

00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:01.889
or maybe in orange colour.

00:22:01.889 --> 00:22:13.279
Let him come, there’s somebody waiting there.

00:22:13.279 --> 00:22:28.940
This Deity is a very powerful Deity, and it
is the wisest Deity, because it is the Deity

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:32.840
which gives us wisdom.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:36.460
You need not argue with the gentleman: It
knows you out and out.

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:43.879
It knows every bit of you.

00:22:43.879 --> 00:22:51.059
If you tell some story, It would say, “All
right, I have heard all this story before,

00:22:51.059 --> 00:22:56.429
now will you please keep to yourself!”

00:22:56.429 --> 00:23:07.320
It understands how genuine you are, how truthful
you are.

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:15.370
And this Deity is the one which has given
these bad experiences to these Kundalini seekers

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:17.590
and writers of Kundalini.

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:27.899
It’s a sad thing that a thief comes to the
town and he’s caught up by the police, he’s

00:23:27.899 --> 00:23:33.750
put in the jail, and when he goes back to
the village, he tells them, “Oh God!

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:34.750
Terrible!

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:35.750
Never go to the city!

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:39.870
They catch hold of you, put you in the jail,
don’t give you food to eat, and then you

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:43.210
cannot meet anyone for three years, and then
they send you back!”

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:46.320
And [so] everybody is frightened of going
to the city.

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:47.350
It is like that.

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:55.880
Or the thief who goes to the bank from the
back door, or sometimes they dig a tunnel

00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:00.840
or something like that: great people in this
world, you know, they have time to do all

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:06.249
kinds of nonsensical things, to dig a tunnel
to get some gold pieces, or something and

00:24:06.249 --> 00:24:12.200
dig another tunnel to go to the jail directly.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:28.529
So, these stupid people, when they try to
do all these gross things, like going to a

00:24:28.529 --> 00:24:36.149
bank through the back door and are caught
up; if you go and ask them their experiences,

00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:38.159
they say, “Oh horrible experience!

00:24:38.159 --> 00:24:39.539
Never go near the bank!

00:24:39.539 --> 00:24:43.639
You don’t put your money there, no, not
at all!”

00:24:43.639 --> 00:24:45.340
You ask them, “Why, what’s the matter?”

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:47.559
They say, “No they catch hold of you!

00:24:47.559 --> 00:24:53.519
You know, terrible people in that bank!”

00:24:53.519 --> 00:24:59.900
They could even go further with it to warn
you.

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:08.470
If they are cunning, they may come by the
front door and tell you, “Why go and put

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:12.749
money in the bank, you give it to me: I can
look after it better.

00:25:12.749 --> 00:25:14.890
It’s a better idea!

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:24.179
And if you want, I can you to twenty percent
more than the bank does!”

00:25:24.179 --> 00:25:31.659
And if you trust their cunning faces, you
just hand over the money and you are lost

00:25:31.659 --> 00:25:32.659
and the bank is lost to you.

00:25:32.659 --> 00:25:33.659
And then you may say that, “What is this
bank?”

00:25:33.659 --> 00:25:45.059
In front of the bank there are people standing
like this.

00:25:45.059 --> 00:25:47.409
What are these religions after all?

00:25:47.409 --> 00:25:55.289
What are these gurus in the name of God, standing
in the front door, trying to rob others?

00:25:55.289 --> 00:26:00.470
What sort of a God is this?

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:07.600
So you start blaming the bank for the thieves
who have cheated you.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:11.450
You must learn to separate both.

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:20.480
This discretion is important even when you
try to know about Kundalini, that Kundalini

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:32.710
is the desire of God to bestow upon you His
kingdom.

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:37.600
The prince has to become the king.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:49.360
And such a beautiful desire cannot be gross,
cannot be ugly, cannot be painful, cannot

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:57.730
be troublesome, cannot be hideous and heinous.

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:04.840
Once you understand this, then you will respect
your Kundalini.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:09.789
She is your Mother because She is going to
give you your second birth.

00:27:09.789 --> 00:27:21.100
And She has been with you for ages, in so
many lives, just waiting for this great time

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:29.749
when She is going to give you your Realisation.

00:27:29.749 --> 00:27:43.309
I am telling you this because I know how beautiful
She is.

00:27:43.309 --> 00:27:54.779
So many have really tortured Her, have frozen
Her, made Her into a stone by cursing Her

00:27:54.779 --> 00:28:06.110
but still She is breathing feebly, with the
hope that a day may come when She may be able

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:13.990
to give you what She has been living for.

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:14.990
This is Kundalini.

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:19.720
This is Kundalini awakening.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:26.389
We have to give up our gross understanding
of Kundalini.

00:28:26.389 --> 00:28:30.259
Like you would see in Sahaja Yoga when you
will be coming, you have seen it all your

00:28:30.259 --> 00:28:35.350
life — and you will see it more — that
so many of them just come to me for getting

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:38.460
all right in health, only for that.

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.400
“I have got a back pain."

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.490
“I have got a stomach trouble."

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:48.230
“I have got arthritis,” or, “I have
got diabetes."

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:56.190
There’s nothing that is not there, and “I
am sure you will cure me!”

00:28:56.190 --> 00:29:08.389
It’s quite a queer situation!

00:29:08.389 --> 00:29:21.350
Because the request that I should cure is
all right, but what is the right for this

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:22.840
request?

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:32.340
Why do you want that Divine should cure you?

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:35.880
For what?

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:41.130
For what purpose?

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:49.399
If Divine has to only cure people, it would
open lots of hospitals and get some Nobel

00:29:49.399 --> 00:29:52.019
Prize or something.

00:29:52.019 --> 00:30:04.980
But it is not the desire of Divine to go on
curing people.

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:10.389
It would be stupid to just cure people who
are good for nothing, useless, absolutely

00:30:10.389 --> 00:30:11.850
useless, thoroughly wasted.

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:14.759
Why should it work [like this]?

00:30:14.759 --> 00:30:16.220
It has intelligence.

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:17.850
It has wisdom.

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:28.110
Is it going to waste its energy on curing
people who are good for nothing, useless?

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:36.999
Are you going to clean this lamp if you cannot
put any light in it?

00:30:36.999 --> 00:30:49.659
If you have no utility, in the Divine sense,
why should Divine cure you?

00:30:49.659 --> 00:30:55.700
So all those who believe, “Oh Mother, you
must cure people,” and that you should cure

00:30:55.700 --> 00:31:06.610
people, must know that all this is the work
of Kundalini when She rises: She nourishes

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:23.929
you, She cleanses you, because in this being
of yours, God Himself is going to manifest,

00:31:23.929 --> 00:31:33.879
because this temple of your body is to be
cleansed, because God has to enter into it.

00:31:33.879 --> 00:31:44.539
That’s why the Divine respects and cleanses
you and helps you.

00:31:44.539 --> 00:31:51.609
Even it may help yours, means say a mother
is there and her child is not all right, she’s

00:31:51.609 --> 00:31:57.629
worried, so the Divine may cure the child,
just to give peace to the mother who is going

00:31:57.629 --> 00:32:00.250
to manifest God’s powers.

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:09.850
Because God’s power is the integrated power
of all the powers.

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:24.159
You can see here, on the left hand side: all
the desires are manifested; the power of desire.

00:32:24.159 --> 00:32:32.970
That means all the desires you have can be
fulfilled and blessed by this power.

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:37.529
Can you believe it?

00:32:37.529 --> 00:32:49.120
It has the power to fulfil all your desires,
but after Realisation, not before that.

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:54.720
And after Realisation, your priorities change
and your desires become different.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:33:06.649
Then you do not ask for money or for children,
or something like that but you start asking

00:33:06.649 --> 00:33:11.669
for something of a very eternal nature.

00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:14.109
The priorities change.

00:33:14.109 --> 00:33:19.169
You start seeing your desire in a different
aspect because light has come now.

00:33:19.169 --> 00:33:25.019
For example, in the darkness when you are
walking, you find that there’s a big black

00:33:25.019 --> 00:33:29.970
bang in front of you, you can’t walk, so
you desire, “Oh this bang should be removed!”

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:33.159
But when the light comes in you find there’s
no bang, nothing!

00:33:33.159 --> 00:33:35.049
It’s all open for you.

00:33:35.049 --> 00:33:44.320
So your desire is that you should be able
to see everything.

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.320
The whole priority changes.

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:52.999
So this Left Side has the power to fulfil
all your desires.

00:33:52.999 --> 00:34:07.950
And the Right Side, where you see this yellow
line, which looks so slender, has the power

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:20.030
to act, to fulfil all your desires and the
desires of God.

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:33.160
Here I take you a little subtler: What are
these acting powers?

00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:34.430
Tremendous!

00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:42.220
For example, this side is manifesting all
the five elements.

00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:47.610
All the five elements await your asking.

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:51.580
You see this fire?

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:54.810
You ask this fire, “Take away my problem!”

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:56.190
It takes away.

00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:58.370
You have seen it.

00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:07.050
Water element: you go to the sea, and just
go and stand in the sea, after Realisation.

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:10.410
You find the whole thing is sucked in.

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:13.260
The Mother Earth sucks all your problems.

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:14.480
It’s so fantastic.

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:18.190
I was in Kuala Lumpur, you may write to him
and find out.

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:22.270
He was the speaker of the assembly: [I was]
at his residence, and there were at least

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:24.110
thousand people.

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:28.250
And sixty percent were sick, and forty were
attending to them.

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:31.460
I was alone: no Sahaja Yogi, nothing.

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:35.600
Luckily, they had a big garden and it was
quite warm day.

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.910
I said, “All right, let’s go in the garden!”

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:41.760
I made them sit in the garden and I asked
the Mother Earth: I said, “You better now

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:42.760
do the job!

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:45.990
And I am sitting down."

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:51.310
And everybody started feeling better.

00:35:51.310 --> 00:36:03.850
One thing I had never before seen being cured
was this polio.

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:07.780
And a little boy, about eight years of age
was sitting on the ground: his parents had

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:10.050
brought him on their back and put him down
there.

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:12.600
He just got up and started walking!

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:22.170
And the parents suddenly realised he’s missing:
“Where is he gone?”

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:25.030
And he was running in the garden!

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:26.030
It’s a fact!

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:27.340
Some blind started seeing things.

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:28.340
It’s most remarkable.

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:33.540
You may write to him, I will give you his
address.

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:37.020
It’s a fact, it happened.

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:38.020
And for everyone the whole miracle was so
simple that they took it for granted; they

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:41.100
didn’t find that there was anything so fantastic:
“After all Mother is here, so it has to

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:42.330
work out!”

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:45.381
They did not rationalise it or anything — took
it for granted.

00:36:45.381 --> 00:36:58.100
And even today, if I go there, this may happen.

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:09.230
All the elements are waiting for your orders.

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:19.560
So the great angels on the left hand side
communicate to the right hand side angels:

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:20.610
all the angels of the world.

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:27.020
Though it may sound fantastic to many, but
they exist, and you have to just ask their

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:28.020
help.

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:36.610
That is what is a mantra: is the awakened
calling, or you can say, calling which has

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:37.610
meaning.

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:44.860
For example: a policeman blows his whistle,
it has a meaning, but anybody else starts

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:52.570
whistling, people will put him in the jail.

00:37:52.570 --> 00:38:02.990
In the same way, the mantra is the authority
which is applied with the word.

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:09.590
And with this you can awaken all these forces
within you.

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:15.560
They are so tremendous that I’ll take at
least seven lectures to describe [and] which

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:23.000
I will describe some time; of which you are
aware already, most of you: how they work

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.830
and how they help you.

00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:36.830
Even we take them for granted, Sahaja Yogis,
because if you notice in life, has one great

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:46.380
mystery, I don’t know if you are aware of
that mystery: that whatever fantastic we get,

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:54.800
somehow or other, we get it in such a way
that we take it for granted.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.610
It’s very sweet, isn’t it?

00:38:56.610 --> 00:39:04.920
Supposing every time we get a shock or we
get frightened, and we say, “Oh God!”

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:08.790
We would become neurotic, or funny people.

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:16.890
But the way it settles down within us like
a leaf falling from the tree and drying out

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:22.590
and just touches the ground softly, and the
ground also takes it for granted.

00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:26.230
In the same way, all this we take for granted.

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:30.910
For example, our eyes, our nose, our forehead,
everything we take for granted, our human

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:35.690
bearing, everything we take it for granted,
in the same way take even Sahaj Yog for granted:

00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:41.490
and that’s the best way.

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:48.830
But do we take it for granted, the way we
take our being for granted?

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:51.000
Is the question.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:58.660
For example, we take it for granted our hand:
so if I have to lift my purse, I lift my hand,

00:39:58.660 --> 00:39:59.660
like this.

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:05.920
When we take Sahaja Yoga for granted, do we
use our vibrations for everything?

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:12.420
Because now in our vibratory awareness, if
we have taken it for granted, we should completely

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:14.620
stand in it and work it out.

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.810
I mean, I do that way.

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:19.980
To me everything is nothing but vibrations.

00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:23.670
Everything I do is nothing but vibrations.

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:29.910
All my movements and everything is nothing
but vibrations.

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:34.660
I take for granted Myself very well.

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:40.930
I wish you could take for granted all that
is within you, the way we take [other things]

00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:41.930
for granted.

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:47.900
Say, I give you a television and you just
take it and you put it to the mains and you

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:49.030
see the thing.

00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:56.840
You do not jump and say, “Oh God, look at
the miracle!

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:57.840
Imagine!”

00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:00.060
Nothing, you just take it for granted.

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:07.140
Anything: computer or any marvellous thing
that you see — you take it for granted.

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:18.320
In the same way, maybe in the beginning one
feels, “How is it possible?”

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:22.600
One may start thinking like that for a while.

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:29.000
Too much thinking is also not good, because
then you are not take it for granted.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.740
But afterwards, you must use it left and right!

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:36.400
Just try!

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.540
You are empowered.

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:39.060
Now your television is open.

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:40.640
It has started working.

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:53.620
You are a great instrument and created [over]
thousands of years with such care.

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:59.830
You do not know what forces have been used:
how delicately and how dynamically.

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:10.920
You have no idea as to how all the stars and
all the heavens are moved up and down to create

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:15.040
this beautiful being that is the human personality.

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:22.260
You have no idea of that.

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:25.420
And now, when Sahaj Yoga takes place, also
you must know that Sahaj Yoga’s working

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:32.200
has been worked out in the very dynamic manner.

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:36.760
There are tremendous subtle forces which are
working it out.

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:43.320
You cannot make your Kundalini pulsate without
something special happening there.

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:49.030
Just think of a remote control that works
out your Kundalini!

00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:53.950
Just think of it!

00:42:53.950 --> 00:43:02.810
There must be a tremendous mechanism!

00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:09.540
Why I say, take it for granted [is] because
if you try first to open all your remote controls

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:20.690
and see for yourself and then breaking all
of them, you start starting your television,

00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:24.790
you will find the whole thing is finished
and you have a headache, and you don’t want

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:26.040
to see anything.

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:32.500
That’s what happens to Sahaj Yogis, specially
in the West, because as soon as they get their

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:38.140
Realisation they go home and make a nice dissection
by thinking about it.

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:41.380
They didn’t get Realisation by thinking!

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:43.550
It’s a simple thing!

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:45.930
And then they go back.

00:43:45.930 --> 00:43:49.830
And then after seven months they come back
and say, “Mother I have been to you seven

00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:58.660
months back, now I think I was wrong."

00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:09.600
So I say: why lose those seven months?

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:16.340
Today I hope you all will feel our subtleties
flowering.

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:25.010
Let us take ourselves down to those subtle
points which we respected and the Kundalini

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:28.620
will nourish it — the attention.

00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:35.830
Wherever your attention goes now, this attention
is enlightened attention.

00:44:35.830 --> 00:44:40.520
Today I received a letter from Australia,
somebody has written, “Mother, we had sent

00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:49.920
you a picture of someone, husband and wife,
and they are better since you gave them bandhan."

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.990
And they were very serious patients.

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:56.070
And they are really better.

00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:58.540
But I did nothing!

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:01.620
Really I don’t do anything.

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:05.350
I just looked at the photograph, that’s
all.

00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:09.280
I didn’t even give bandhan, you know, to
be very frank.

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:10.280
I just looked at it, that’s all.

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:13.070
I didn’t think, I just looked at it, and
it worked.

00:45:13.070 --> 00:45:14.950
Really I don’t do anything!

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:18.141
You people thank me for nothing at all, you
know.

00:45:18.141 --> 00:45:21.250
When you don’t do anything and people thank
you, you don’t know what to say so you go

00:45:21.250 --> 00:45:25.050
on saying, “All right, thank you for thanking!”
(laughing)

00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:33.240
So again, thank you for being here.

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:36.570
And we’ll have some meditation.

00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:42.400
I hope we’ll touch some deeper stratas within
yourselves.

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:43.730
May God bless you all!

00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:51.520
You have come for the first time both of you?

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.210
You have been once before?

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:54.570
What about you?

00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:57.630
Lady: It’s my first time.

00:45:57.630 --> 00:46:00.080
Shri Mataji: First time?

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:01.080
Good.

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:02.080
Are you feeling the cool breeze?

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:03.080
Seeker: Yes.

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:04.080
Shri Mataji: All right, so you haven’t lost
it!

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:06.170
And what about you, are you feeling the cool
breeze in the hand?

00:46:06.170 --> 00:46:07.170
Seeker: No

00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:08.310
Shri Mataji: Not yet?

00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:10.371
All right, it will work out, it will work
out.

00:46:10.371 --> 00:46:11.371
What about you?

00:46:11.371 --> 00:46:14.680
Are you feeling the cool breeze?

00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:15.990
No?

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:18.170
How are you?

00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:20.053
Yogi: Feeling the cool breeze Mother.

00:46:20.053 --> 00:46:21.053
Shri Mataji: Well good!

00:46:21.053 --> 00:46:22.053
Good!

00:46:22.053 --> 00:46:23.053
Good!

00:46:23.053 --> 00:46:24.053
Are you all right?

00:46:24.053 --> 00:46:25.620
Good.What about you?

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:27.190
Lady: I don’t feel today.

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:28.341
Shri Mataji: You are thinking!

00:46:28.341 --> 00:46:29.341
Now, please!

00:46:29.341 --> 00:46:30.341
Please!

00:46:30.341 --> 00:46:33.960
You see, thinking stops it.

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:35.260
How?

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:41.830
Between the two thoughts — for example,
a thought rises and falls off, and another

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:49.590
thought rises and falls off — between these
two thoughts there is a little gap, that gap

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:50.590
has expanded.

00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:56.340
For example, the thought that was, is the
past and that is going to come is the future.

00:46:56.340 --> 00:47:00.920
In between is the space called as vilamba.

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:05.320
And when you start thinking about it you jump
onto the cusp of these thoughts.

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:08.480
You are beyond thought.

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:18.900
An Indian will understand it faster, because
it’s called as Nirvichar Samadhi: is the

00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:20.920
state where you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:22.950
They know that that’s what it is.

00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:26.850
You cannot think about it, because rationality
is a limited thing.

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:32.280
So you have to jump into the space.

00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:37.470
When you are in the space then you are not
in the capsule.

00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:41.690
But if you are in the capsule you are not
in the space.

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:44.650
Better now?

00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:47.600
Lady: Yes.

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:56.680
Shri Mataji: See how it works.

00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:01.400
Even your problems, I mean, I have given big
lectures on this, how to solve your problems,

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:02.900
in your thoughtless awareness.

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:11.500
That’s the mouth, that’s the mouth where
you have to put the problem in, and it works

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:13.870
in your thoughtless awareness.

00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:20.020
It’s the most precious thing, is to keep
it up.

00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:26.590
Are you getting now cool breeze?

00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:27.690
Correct.

00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:29.900
What about you, not yet?

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:30.900
Now watch me here.

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:32.460
Are you thinking still?

00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:34.830
All right, you watch me without thinking.

00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:36.930
That’s another way you can do it.

00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:41.790
My face is such a funny thing that if you
watch it for a long time, you will have no

00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:42.790
thoughts!

00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:45.070
Just it is something very funny you know!

00:48:45.070 --> 00:48:50.550
Today it happened: I went to the tailor and
he just looked at me and he didn’t know

00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:52.650
what he was trying to do.

00:48:52.650 --> 00:49:00.360
And my husband said, “Is he stunned or what
happened?”

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:01.360
(laughter)

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:04.580
Now watch me without thinking!

00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:06.830
Better!

00:49:06.830 --> 00:49:09.070
See!

00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:14.440
This is the face!

00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:16.630
This is needed.

00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:18.860
What am I to do?

00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:24.180
I mean, this is the problem with me.

00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:28.430
I don’t know how to explain myself!

00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:29.510
Aap ka aa rahe thanda?

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:30.510
Thik hai.

00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:31.950
(Hindi: Are you getting cool?

00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:32.950
Good!)

00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:33.950
How are you now?

00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:34.950
Better?

00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:35.950
Everyday you will be better and better and
better.

00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:36.950
How are you?

00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:37.950
Lady: A bit better.

00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:38.950
Not so good as yesterday.

00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:47.740
I felt a lot of cool breeze yesterday but
not so much today.

00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:51.750
Shri Mataji: So, that means you are going
down a little.

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:52.750
All right?

00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:56.080
So now keep it up.

00:49:56.080 --> 00:50:04.960
You see, it is like a washing machine, I can
say.

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:09.480
It goes round and round, a little bit, for
cleansing.

00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:10.480
All right?

00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:11.480
They call it Mahamaya.

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:13.380
They call it “The Great Illusion”.

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:15.640
Mother is a great illusion, because She puts
us into illusion.

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:16.640
I do not!

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:19.100
We tell God, “Lead us not into temptation."

00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:22.470
Now why will He take you to temptation?

00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:25.590
But you do go.

00:50:25.590 --> 00:50:29.350
So you tell God that, “You keep us away
from that!”

00:50:29.350 --> 00:50:32.580
That’s all you tell God: that, “You keep
us away from thinking!”

00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:44.590
And it works.

00:50:44.590 --> 00:50:50.540
Better?

00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:52.620
Your face looks different immediately.

00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:55.640
Keep it up!

00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:58.660
Now all right.

00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:02.690
Good, once it clicks!

00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:04.370
But you must come every Monday.

00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:05.520
See how people have gone up!

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:07.500
How many people they are giving Realisation?

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:09.180
All right?

00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:16.740
You must come, this is the most pleasurable
thing!

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:17.740
You don’t know.

00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:20.460
It is little bit you have to develop the taste.

00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:23.470
Because you are used to the gross stuff, you
see.

00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:27.570
Like somebody who is used to wines cannot
give up.

00:51:27.570 --> 00:51:34.670
But once the wine from within starts pouring
in, you just don’t want it!

00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:36.830
Better.

00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:44.490
Somebody has come I believe.

00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:46.360
Hmmm!

00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:51.960
He’s better now.

00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:55.700
All right?

00:51:55.700 --> 00:52:01.310
What’s happened Gavin?

00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:03.960
I see that so clear!

00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:04.960
Why?

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:05.960
You’ve been having a holiday or what?

00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:07.590
It’s horrible, absolutely!

00:52:07.590 --> 00:52:11.220
Very badly caught up!

00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:13.050
What’s the matter?

00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:16.590
You had a bad cold?

00:52:16.590 --> 00:52:18.970
Come here!

00:52:18.970 --> 00:52:24.930
I have never seen you being caught that much.

00:52:24.930 --> 00:52:41.720
You had exposed yourself I think [it was]
the sunning or what happened?

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:48.920
Terrible!

00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:56.130
Better?

00:52:56.130 --> 00:52:57.130
Be careful!

00:52:57.130 --> 00:53:02.760
You see, these days it’s very sunny, looks
sunny, but maybe…You have to look after

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:03.760
yourself.

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:06.450
This country is full of this problem.

00:53:06.450 --> 00:53:10.190
Now better.

00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:13.940
What’s it?

00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:15.810
Vishuddhi.

00:53:15.810 --> 00:53:27.050
It rises from Vishuddhi to this.

00:53:27.050 --> 00:53:28.920
Haa!

00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:32.670
Better now.

00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:58.060
You sit or a while and it will work out in
the…You see it rises from the Vishuddhi

00:53:58.060 --> 00:53:59.060
to the.

00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:04.610
I think you caught cold very badly.

00:54:04.610 --> 00:54:06.790
What happened?

00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:12.260
Gavin Brown: I don’t know.

00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:22.110
Shri Mataji: I think you put your hand here.

00:54:22.110 --> 00:54:24.300
Sit down!

00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:25.300
Be careful.

00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:26.300
Hmm!

00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:27.300
Better.

00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:28.590
Somebody with cold must have come or something
you see, or the hay fever is there.

00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:32.390
Gavin Brown: Might be that.

00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:37.430
Shri Mataji: From Right Nabhi: it’s on the
right hand side the problem is.

00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:41.300
How are you?

00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:44.650
Good!

00:54:44.650 --> 00:55:04.800
Now close your eyes, close.

00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:15.580
You put your hand here, the right, and the
left there to work out the Vishuddhi.

00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:19.010
Right Nabhi also.

00:55:19.010 --> 00:55:23.560
Is it your liver coming up or what?

00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:31.060
Gavin Brown: I don’t think so.

00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:38.560
Shri Mataji: Quite a lot eh?

00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:42.310
Gavin Brown: Hmm.

00:55:42.310 --> 00:55:52.310
Shri Mataji: All right, move from the left
more, from the left.

00:55:52.310 --> 00:55:57.620
Keep your eyes shut and enjoy your Self, enjoy
your Self.

00:55:57.620 --> 00:55:59.270
Just don’t think.

00:55:59.270 --> 00:56:01.380
Just don’t think.

00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:08.830
Just enjoy your Self.

00:56:08.830 --> 00:56:13.720
Don’t think.

00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:18.600
Don’t think.

00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:21.040
Hmm!

00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:23.480
Better.

00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:33.250
Where is it Mark?

00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:38.140
Whole Left?

00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:43.020
Better now?

00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:45.460
Improving?

00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:47.910
Heart?

00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:50.350
Better.

00:56:50.350 --> 00:57:00.120
Keep your eyes shut!

00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:07.440
Enjoy your Self.

00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:14.080
You are all going down into your Self.

00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:15.430
Just allow it.

00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:17.310
Relax, relax.

00:57:17.310 --> 00:57:19.190
Just relax.

00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:29.480
Don’t think about anything just relax.

00:57:29.480 --> 00:58:11.200
You are working it out.

00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:36.230
Now just relax.

00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:52.920
Don’t think.

00:58:52.920 --> 00:59:09.600
Better now.

00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:17.950
Tremendous!

00:59:17.950 --> 00:59:26.290
Haa?

00:59:26.290 --> 00:59:42.980
Giving out.

00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:51.320
Better.

00:59:51.320 --> 01:00:16.350
Now, better now?

01:00:16.350 --> 01:01:28.410
Now are

01:01:28.410 --> 01:01:29.800
you feeling?

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:30.970
Better?

01:01:30.970 --> 01:01:33.300
Losing again?

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:35.710
You are losing again?

01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:37.650
What?

01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:42.550
Come up, come here.

01:01:42.550 --> 01:01:44.310
Sit down.

01:01:44.310 --> 01:01:46.080
Sit down.

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:58.450
See your liver comes back again: still treating
your liver patients there is it?

01:01:58.450 --> 01:01:59.710
Come forward, come forward.

01:01:59.710 --> 01:02:01.890
I’ll have to put my foot on your liver.

01:02:01.890 --> 01:02:03.830
Now just see how stone-like it has become.

01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:10.460
See now, what else do you expect but heat?

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:15.040
See?

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:33.370
That’s what it is.

01:02:33.370 --> 01:02:42.540
Now better?

01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:56.600
Somebody’s catching on the Back Agnya.

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:57.600
Hmm!

01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:58.600
Gavin Brown: It’s moving.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:02:59.600
It’s moving now.

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:00.600
Shri Mataji: Better?

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:01.600
Much better now.

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:02.600
Sorry I have to use my feet but they are very
powerful you know.

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.660
For physical problems they are better than
my hands are.

01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:17.180
Poor things, they go on working morning till
evening!

01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:31.220
Press it hard!

01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:35.900
Better!

01:03:35.900 --> 01:04:02.830
Still you are working with the liver patients
are they?

01:04:02.830 --> 01:04:04.480
Doctor: Hmm.

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:07.960
Shri Mataji: What do you do about them?

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:11.660
What treatments do you give for liver patients
in the hospitals?

01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:13.110
Doctor: Special drugs.

01:04:13.110 --> 01:04:15.030
Shri Mataji: What drugs?

01:04:15.030 --> 01:04:17.940
Doctor: Depends what the problem is with the
liver.

01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:19.923
Shri Mataji: But still what drugs normally
you use?

01:04:19.923 --> 01:04:30.310
Doctor: The main things they use are for someone
who is alcoholic and they start to bleed.

01:04:30.310 --> 01:04:31.310
Shri Mataji: Alcohol?

01:04:31.310 --> 01:04:33.620
Doctor: They have alcoholic cirrhosis and
they bleed and they vomit blood.

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:34.620
Shri Mataji: Really?

01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:35.620
That serious?

01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:46.670
Doctor: So we have special drugs to help stop
that.

01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:56.460
Shri Mataji: Just look at this!

01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:58.430
Despite that, nobody publishes these things.

01:04:58.430 --> 01:05:05.460
You know, the other day in a very so-called
important dinner table, there was a big argument

01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:13.500
[that] was on that, in France, the pubs are
open all the time, while here they open very

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:18.770
late, so people are very unhappy that you
are not sufficiently alcoholic!

01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:21.590
A big discussion is on.

01:05:21.590 --> 01:05:23.170
Let them see these photographs!

01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:30.050
Why not show them how people vomit blood and
how people do these things.

01:05:30.050 --> 01:05:35.730
It would be a good idea.

01:05:35.730 --> 01:05:36.730
And the food they eat do they?

01:05:36.730 --> 01:05:42.710
Doctor: Well, there’s so many different
problems we have with the liver.

01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:48.657
Say, they are alcoholic then they have intravenous
therapy.

01:05:48.657 --> 01:05:49.657
Shri Mataji: They cannot eat the food?

01:05:49.657 --> 01:05:50.657
They vomit?

01:05:50.657 --> 01:05:51.657
Doctor: So they put special tubes down them
to stop them vomiting, and then they give

01:05:51.657 --> 01:05:51.950
them blood because they are losing so much.
