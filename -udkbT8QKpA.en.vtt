00:03.090 --> 00:09.790
We have sometimes heard about people who get
a hunch.

00:09.790 --> 00:18.980
Like somebody says, “I must buy this house,
I get a hunch that I should buy it."

00:18.980 --> 00:27.730
Or sometimes people say that, “I always
hear something, somebody tells me that this

00:27.730 --> 00:31.850
should not be done."

00:31.850 --> 00:46.710
But all such suggestions must be judged that
they come to you to tell you about something

00:46.710 --> 00:57.469
of the beyond or something that concerns the
mundane life, like buying a house.

00:57.469 --> 01:07.439
God is not interested, very much, in what
house you buy, or how much money you make

01:07.439 --> 01:10.100
in a race: He is not!

01:10.100 --> 01:11.389
Because it is not important to God.

01:11.389 --> 01:14.810
One can understand that, isn’t it.

01:14.810 --> 01:21.070
Also that God is not interested in telling
you against someone in the ear that, “Beware

01:21.070 --> 01:25.240
of this man, he is a dangerous guy!”

01:25.240 --> 01:35.450
For, if somebody is going to harm you physically,
maybe to some part, we can say that God wants

01:35.450 --> 01:43.759
to preserve your body; but this body is also
not so important to God, because He can create

01:43.759 --> 01:47.169
it again!

01:47.169 --> 02:06.099
The most important thing that God has to give
us is His love, His connection with us, His

02:06.099 --> 02:11.410
Kingdom, His powers.

02:11.410 --> 02:19.840
So, the subtleties which we should really
accept within us, should be [those] which

02:19.840 --> 02:30.300
take you to the realm of joy, to the realm
of collectivity.

02:30.300 --> 02:37.980
Like suddenly you see a little child weeping
on the street and you feel [that] your heart

02:37.980 --> 02:38.980
is weeping.

02:38.980 --> 02:46.819
Not that you feel guilty about it but you
feel one with the child and you feel you are

02:46.819 --> 02:55.569
weeping: then definitely that subtlety of
compassion that God is, is felt within you.

02:55.569 --> 03:03.620
But you don’t feel guilty about it, or you
don’t give him 2p (£0.02) or something

03:03.620 --> 03:07.290
to insult his ego.

03:07.290 --> 03:14.019
You do something very constructive about it,
extremely constructive, and you do it secretly;

03:14.019 --> 03:21.040
you don’t like to tell anybody about it
because you think it is vulgar to talk about

03:21.040 --> 03:22.849
your compassion.

03:22.849 --> 03:29.459
You do it so sweetly that the other fellow
doesn’t feel it.

03:29.459 --> 03:38.420
The whole act is such a beautifying thing.

03:38.420 --> 03:43.200
You don’t announce it in the paper and you
don’t publish it in “Who’s Who” or

03:43.200 --> 03:51.249
you do not go for a Nobel Prize or something
like that.

03:51.249 --> 03:58.459
This is all very vulgar for the Subtle Thing
that you worship within yourself, because

03:58.459 --> 04:07.739
that element within you is so much higher
than all these gross considerations that you

04:07.739 --> 04:09.830
just care for that.

04:09.830 --> 04:12.170
That is what God is.

04:12.170 --> 04:19.019
That’s how God shines within us, even before
our Realisation, before our connection with

04:19.019 --> 04:21.289
God.

04:21.289 --> 04:28.740
He shines in some people even before they
have been Realised.

04:28.740 --> 04:40.180
You see them, they are quiet people, they
are not show-offs, but they are very sincere,

04:40.180 --> 04:44.330
extremely kind-hearted.

04:44.330 --> 04:53.000
Such people when they face Sahaja Yoga, immediately
they get their vibrations.

04:53.000 --> 05:00.389
They are not people who are worried about
money, or they are worried about the gross

05:00.389 --> 05:13.400
things of life, or achievements that are so
stupid.

05:13.400 --> 05:18.940
Such people may exist as very ordinary people;
they need not be at the helm of affairs [and]

05:18.940 --> 05:21.629
mostly they are not, because they are not
ambitious.

05:21.629 --> 05:25.440
They do not want much success in life.

05:25.440 --> 05:29.850
They don’t see any point in being very successful.

05:29.850 --> 05:34.660
They might be something very ordinary.

05:34.660 --> 05:38.500
They might be doing something very important
also.

05:38.500 --> 05:50.349
But in their life, those who come in contact
with them, remember that: “Yes!

05:50.349 --> 05:54.669
There was a life or there is a life.

05:54.669 --> 06:02.840
Definitely there is a spark."

06:02.840 --> 06:10.630
Because such a person being so subtle does
not assert.

06:10.630 --> 06:17.909
Such a person cannot be very dominating, assertive,
argumentative.

06:17.909 --> 06:33.159
Such a person is quieter: his attention recedes
from all quarrels and all squabbles of life.

06:33.159 --> 06:42.380
But such a person has a great position in
the domain of God.

06:42.380 --> 06:57.819
That you have seen, how in Sahaja Yoga suddenly
you find people manifesting their divinity.

06:57.819 --> 07:03.970
Maybe such a person is too naïve for all
practical purposes.

07:03.970 --> 07:12.330
He might have been cheated, might have been
misled by some horrible people who try to

07:12.330 --> 07:18.610
exploit his seeking, but still it remains.

07:18.610 --> 07:29.500
This element suddenly gets ignited in Sahaja
Yoga and for such a person this is the most

07:29.500 --> 07:39.360
important thing: is to feel that Being which
always kept him away from all the rest of

07:39.360 --> 07:50.819
the ideologies and ‘great’ things and
have always given him strength and confidence

07:50.819 --> 07:51.819
and joy.

07:51.819 --> 07:56.699
He sees that clearly in Sahaj Yog.

07:56.699 --> 07:58.669
He adheres to it.

07:58.669 --> 08:05.400
And when he nourishes it, he’s amazed that
he has found himself.

08:05.400 --> 08:10.719
Then it becomes his life.

08:10.719 --> 08:23.669
There are thousands and thousands of people
everywhere.

08:23.669 --> 08:28.510
I say ‘thousands’, I don’t say ‘millions’.

08:28.510 --> 08:32.580
I am sorry, because they are not in millions.

08:32.580 --> 08:35.100
I am sorry for that.

08:35.100 --> 08:37.110
I wish they were.

08:37.110 --> 08:47.030
They could be counted in thousands only: maybe
twenty-one thousand, altogether, of that quality.

08:47.030 --> 08:51.610
There won’t be millions.

08:51.610 --> 08:54.710
But they will be making millions later on.

08:54.710 --> 08:57.530
They have to be a few!

08:57.530 --> 09:04.860
These are people of special calibre as I said.

09:04.860 --> 09:11.970
But it is necessary that everybody must be
given Self-realisation, every seed must be

09:11.970 --> 09:12.970
germinated.

09:12.970 --> 09:20.980
But how many would sprout into the trees and
would render fruit is a different point altogether.

09:20.980 --> 09:28.070
First and foremost thing is that, first let
them all be germinated.

09:28.070 --> 09:33.920
In due course, all those would come back.

09:33.920 --> 09:47.190
But some would prosper into their complete
manifestation, in their full bloom in a very

09:47.190 --> 09:51.920
short time, and that’s what matters the
most.

09:51.920 --> 09:57.220
The Divine is not interested in useless people,
It is interested in that special calibre.

09:57.220 --> 10:06.230
As I have told you: such a person may not
be at all rich, may be absolutely poor.

10:06.230 --> 10:07.980
That doesn’t mean that rich cannot be so!

10:07.980 --> 10:12.560
[They] can be very rich also.

10:12.560 --> 10:19.820
The outward appearances and status and all
these denominations do not matter at all.

10:19.820 --> 10:24.480
I am talking of the spark inside.

10:24.480 --> 10:34.090
They can be called as gentlemen, in simple
words, or if she is [female], a lady .

10:34.090 --> 10:44.960
A serene dignity manifests through their being.

10:44.960 --> 10:49.840
Sometimes it happens with their lives, also,
that they find it very difficult to keep to

10:49.840 --> 10:59.080
the norms of the mad world, and they may be
a little cynical sometimes, could be.

10:59.080 --> 11:07.370
But cynicism is not that subtlety, but they
may appear to people a little cynical.

11:07.370 --> 11:16.060
But they have to be very delightful and extremely
cheerful people.

11:16.060 --> 11:23.540
They cannot be morose, sad, emitting unhappiness
all around, and big bores with a B capital

11:23.540 --> 11:27.160
and O capital, R and E, all capital.

11:27.160 --> 11:28.370
That cannot be possible.

11:28.370 --> 11:34.120
They are extremely enjoyable and magnetic
and dynamic.

11:34.120 --> 11:45.010
They are complete in themselves because they
feel their subtlety, they live on that.

11:45.010 --> 11:55.020
Still their seeking is there, and the meaning
they try to find to their own being.

11:55.020 --> 12:00.720
And they want to identify their subtlety with
something that is universal.

12:00.720 --> 12:10.940
In their expression in any field that they
are, they appeal to the Universal Being within

12:10.940 --> 12:13.400
every one of us.

12:13.400 --> 12:25.510
Maybe, they may not get a Nobel Prize, but
[they have] a personality that emits that

12:25.510 --> 12:29.510
kind of congenial behaviour.

12:29.510 --> 12:37.640
Now if somebody is a person who is absolutely
satanic, he will abhor such a person, possibly.

12:37.640 --> 12:47.980
But this does not concern to the subtler being
because he is at a level which is not tarnished

12:47.980 --> 12:54.920
by gross attacks.

12:54.920 --> 13:02.900
That is what one has to recognise in oneself
and one should feel very proud and fortunate

13:02.900 --> 13:05.260
that that exists within us.

13:05.260 --> 13:11.790
No more one has to feel lonely, because now
we are so many of us, of the same creed and

13:11.790 --> 13:14.120
the same type.

13:14.120 --> 13:22.070
And so many of us who have found out what
is the reason, what expresses it, what manifests

13:22.070 --> 13:38.610
it within us, what are the Deities that govern
this subtlety within us: what you may call

13:38.610 --> 13:47.120
the archetype images; archetype images are
there which are real, not imaginary, within

13:47.120 --> 13:48.180
us.

13:48.180 --> 13:55.610
And all these discoveries, then make you feel
confident of all these vague subtleties you

13:55.610 --> 14:01.120
have been enjoying so far.

14:01.120 --> 14:16.610
A long time back, I had given a simile like
this: that a mother bird puts the little child,

14:16.610 --> 14:20.970
or you can call, the baby bird, away from
her.

14:20.970 --> 14:34.390
And the baby bird feels the mother’s warmth,
and she wants that.

14:34.390 --> 14:38.910
And she is calling for the mother.

14:38.910 --> 14:44.140
That calling itself is the last thing it knows
of.

14:44.140 --> 14:48.710
That’s the highest thing for the baby bird,
nothing else matters.

14:48.710 --> 14:53.980
You may give anything to the baby bird [but]
it won’t be happy, it needs that.

14:53.980 --> 14:59.410
It needs that warmth, that love.

14:59.410 --> 15:07.000
And then it expresses itself by spreading
its tiny little wings around and tries to

15:07.000 --> 15:10.800
hop and to express it.

15:10.800 --> 15:18.640
And then out of complete joy of its hopping,
the mother bird herself comes down and engulfs

15:18.640 --> 15:26.940
that child into the wings, giving all the
warmth necessary.

15:26.940 --> 15:39.990
It is that happening within us which takes
place when the Kundalini rises.

15:39.990 --> 15:52.570
The Kundalini is the part of that warmth within
us, of that compassion.

15:52.570 --> 16:06.970
It’s a part of that beauty, it’s the part
of that desire.

16:06.970 --> 16:08.630
Desire…

16:08.630 --> 16:10.850
What’s the matter?

16:10.850 --> 16:14.060
The door is open or not.

16:14.060 --> 16:19.010
Come in, come in!

16:19.010 --> 16:40.630
They are waiting because they [don’t want
to disturb].

16:40.630 --> 16:41.630
What’s the matter?

16:41.630 --> 16:42.630
Yogi: Sorry we’re late Shri Mataji.

16:42.630 --> 16:43.630
Shri Mataji: No, it’s all right.

16:43.630 --> 16:44.630
Come in!

16:44.630 --> 16:46.760
So the desire of God is placed within us as
Kundalini.

16:46.760 --> 17:02.990
And when all the external desires dim out
within us and the real desire to be one with

17:02.990 --> 17:13.000
the Almighty remains, the Kundalini can rise
spontaneously.

17:13.000 --> 17:21.110
That has happened to few people, very few
people: you can say like Buddha, Mahavira.

17:21.110 --> 17:34.320
These people were human beings and they achieved
godliness: not by forcing yourself to get

17:34.320 --> 17:47.750
rid of your desires, but through wisdom, understanding
that, “This is stupidity, this is foolishness.

17:47.750 --> 17:51.129
Where am I going?”

17:51.129 --> 17:54.379
Just the wisdom acting.

17:54.379 --> 18:05.139
Not a rational understanding, but the being
itself rejecting.

18:05.139 --> 18:11.309
Such stages are achieved through one’s own
evolutionary forces.

18:11.309 --> 18:28.750
Also, there are so many other happenings,
or the other supports, which bring forth this

18:28.750 --> 18:33.860
kind of spontaneous rising of the Kundalini.

18:33.860 --> 18:40.520
There is somebody who wants to come and see
me because he said, “Mother you are an authority

18:40.520 --> 18:52.740
on Kundalini and there are many books written
about Kundalini, and I have to write a criticism:

18:52.740 --> 19:01.360
that the Kundalini, when she rises, you start
jumping and when she rises she gives you heat,

19:01.360 --> 19:09.009
or you burn off yourself or you jump through
the roof or something like that."

19:09.009 --> 19:18.190
All sorts of horrifying things and nobody
wants to listen to anything about Kundalini.

19:18.190 --> 19:20.410
If you read those books, you’ll be really
frightened.

19:20.410 --> 19:27.039
I think it is absolutely satanic.

19:27.039 --> 19:33.950
And he wants to know about the ‘authentic
description’ of Kundalini.

19:33.950 --> 19:48.899
And I told him that, “These books, all of
them, should be thrown away into the sea!

19:48.899 --> 19:57.490
Because they are written by people who have
had no experience of Kundalini, of any kind."

19:57.490 --> 20:07.790
Because they were people who must have been
doing some sort of an ‘adventure’ somewhere.

20:07.790 --> 20:16.929
Like some people believe that even finding
of God is another job: if you have no job,

20:16.929 --> 20:22.570
better find God, at least He might help you
to survive!

20:22.570 --> 20:35.820
Some people do believe that instead of sitting
idle, why not try to find God, would be a

20:35.820 --> 20:38.809
good idea.

20:38.809 --> 20:48.070
And when such a thing happens and they venture
into the search of God then, first, they are

20:48.070 --> 20:56.029
hit by The Guard of Holiness.

20:56.029 --> 21:03.520
Because they are not entitled, they are not
holy, they have no protocol about God Almighty,

21:03.520 --> 21:07.730
they have no respect, they are just doing
it because they are ego-oriented, they want

21:07.730 --> 21:14.440
to have another ego-trip and they want to
become ‘great explorers’ of Kundalini.

21:14.440 --> 21:20.039
But you cannot do it.

21:20.039 --> 21:23.600
You have to have proper protocol.

21:23.600 --> 21:41.420
They lack all humility, all holiness, righteousness
and all that is needed, to ask the help of

21:41.420 --> 21:43.769
the Kundalini.

21:43.769 --> 21:51.360
And they are hit by the first Deity, which
sits in the triangular bone, which they can

21:51.360 --> 21:57.710
also see sometimes — they have seen him,
with a temper; in red colour, they call it

21:57.710 --> 22:01.889
or maybe in orange colour.

22:01.889 --> 22:13.279
Let him come, there’s somebody waiting there.

22:13.279 --> 22:28.940
This Deity is a very powerful Deity, and it
is the wisest Deity, because it is the Deity

22:28.940 --> 22:32.840
which gives us wisdom.

22:32.840 --> 22:36.460
You need not argue with the gentleman: It
knows you out and out.

22:36.460 --> 22:43.879
It knows every bit of you.

22:43.879 --> 22:51.059
If you tell some story, It would say, “All
right, I have heard all this story before,

22:51.059 --> 22:56.429
now will you please keep to yourself!”

22:56.429 --> 23:07.320
It understands how genuine you are, how truthful
you are.

23:07.320 --> 23:15.370
And this Deity is the one which has given
these bad experiences to these Kundalini seekers

23:15.370 --> 23:17.590
and writers of Kundalini.

23:17.590 --> 23:27.899
It’s a sad thing that a thief comes to the
town and he’s caught up by the police, he’s

23:27.899 --> 23:33.750
put in the jail, and when he goes back to
the village, he tells them, “Oh God!

23:33.750 --> 23:34.750
Terrible!

23:34.750 --> 23:35.750
Never go to the city!

23:35.750 --> 23:39.870
They catch hold of you, put you in the jail,
don’t give you food to eat, and then you

23:39.870 --> 23:43.210
cannot meet anyone for three years, and then
they send you back!”

23:43.210 --> 23:46.320
And [so] everybody is frightened of going
to the city.

23:46.320 --> 23:47.350
It is like that.

23:47.350 --> 23:55.880
Or the thief who goes to the bank from the
back door, or sometimes they dig a tunnel

23:55.880 --> 24:00.840
or something like that: great people in this
world, you know, they have time to do all

24:00.840 --> 24:06.249
kinds of nonsensical things, to dig a tunnel
to get some gold pieces, or something and

24:06.249 --> 24:12.200
dig another tunnel to go to the jail directly.

24:12.200 --> 24:28.529
So, these stupid people, when they try to
do all these gross things, like going to a

24:28.529 --> 24:36.149
bank through the back door and are caught
up; if you go and ask them their experiences,

24:36.149 --> 24:38.159
they say, “Oh horrible experience!

24:38.159 --> 24:39.539
Never go near the bank!

24:39.539 --> 24:43.639
You don’t put your money there, no, not
at all!”

24:43.639 --> 24:45.340
You ask them, “Why, what’s the matter?”

24:45.340 --> 24:47.559
They say, “No they catch hold of you!

24:47.559 --> 24:53.519
You know, terrible people in that bank!”

24:53.519 --> 24:59.900
They could even go further with it to warn
you.

24:59.900 --> 25:08.470
If they are cunning, they may come by the
front door and tell you, “Why go and put

25:08.470 --> 25:12.749
money in the bank, you give it to me: I can
look after it better.

25:12.749 --> 25:14.890
It’s a better idea!

25:14.890 --> 25:24.179
And if you want, I can you to twenty percent
more than the bank does!”

25:24.179 --> 25:31.659
And if you trust their cunning faces, you
just hand over the money and you are lost

25:31.659 --> 25:32.659
and the bank is lost to you.

25:32.659 --> 25:33.659
And then you may say that, “What is this
bank?”

25:33.659 --> 25:45.059
In front of the bank there are people standing
like this.

25:45.059 --> 25:47.409
What are these religions after all?

25:47.409 --> 25:55.289
What are these gurus in the name of God, standing
in the front door, trying to rob others?

25:55.289 --> 26:00.470
What sort of a God is this?

26:00.470 --> 26:07.600
So you start blaming the bank for the thieves
who have cheated you.

26:07.600 --> 26:11.450
You must learn to separate both.

26:11.450 --> 26:20.480
This discretion is important even when you
try to know about Kundalini, that Kundalini

26:20.480 --> 26:32.710
is the desire of God to bestow upon you His
kingdom.

26:32.710 --> 26:37.600
The prince has to become the king.

26:37.600 --> 26:49.360
And such a beautiful desire cannot be gross,
cannot be ugly, cannot be painful, cannot

26:49.360 --> 26:57.730
be troublesome, cannot be hideous and heinous.

26:57.730 --> 27:04.840
Once you understand this, then you will respect
your Kundalini.

27:04.840 --> 27:09.789
She is your Mother because She is going to
give you your second birth.

27:09.789 --> 27:21.100
And She has been with you for ages, in so
many lives, just waiting for this great time

27:21.100 --> 27:29.749
when She is going to give you your Realisation.

27:29.749 --> 27:43.309
I am telling you this because I know how beautiful
She is.

27:43.309 --> 27:54.779
So many have really tortured Her, have frozen
Her, made Her into a stone by cursing Her

27:54.779 --> 28:06.110
but still She is breathing feebly, with the
hope that a day may come when She may be able

28:06.110 --> 28:13.990
to give you what She has been living for.

28:13.990 --> 28:14.990
This is Kundalini.

28:14.990 --> 28:19.720
This is Kundalini awakening.

28:19.720 --> 28:26.389
We have to give up our gross understanding
of Kundalini.

28:26.389 --> 28:30.259
Like you would see in Sahaja Yoga when you
will be coming, you have seen it all your

28:30.259 --> 28:35.350
life — and you will see it more — that
so many of them just come to me for getting

28:35.350 --> 28:38.460
all right in health, only for that.

28:38.460 --> 28:40.400
“I have got a back pain."

28:40.400 --> 28:43.490
“I have got a stomach trouble."

28:43.490 --> 28:48.230
“I have got arthritis,” or, “I have
got diabetes."

28:48.230 --> 28:56.190
There’s nothing that is not there, and “I
am sure you will cure me!”

28:56.190 --> 29:08.389
It’s quite a queer situation!

29:08.389 --> 29:21.350
Because the request that I should cure is
all right, but what is the right for this

29:21.350 --> 29:22.840
request?

29:22.840 --> 29:32.340
Why do you want that Divine should cure you?

29:32.340 --> 29:35.880
For what?

29:35.880 --> 29:41.130
For what purpose?

29:41.130 --> 29:49.399
If Divine has to only cure people, it would
open lots of hospitals and get some Nobel

29:49.399 --> 29:52.019
Prize or something.

29:52.019 --> 30:04.980
But it is not the desire of Divine to go on
curing people.

30:04.980 --> 30:10.389
It would be stupid to just cure people who
are good for nothing, useless, absolutely

30:10.389 --> 30:11.850
useless, thoroughly wasted.

30:11.850 --> 30:14.759
Why should it work [like this]?

30:14.759 --> 30:16.220
It has intelligence.

30:16.220 --> 30:17.850
It has wisdom.

30:17.850 --> 30:28.110
Is it going to waste its energy on curing
people who are good for nothing, useless?

30:28.110 --> 30:36.999
Are you going to clean this lamp if you cannot
put any light in it?

30:36.999 --> 30:49.659
If you have no utility, in the Divine sense,
why should Divine cure you?

30:49.659 --> 30:55.700
So all those who believe, “Oh Mother, you
must cure people,” and that you should cure

30:55.700 --> 31:06.610
people, must know that all this is the work
of Kundalini when She rises: She nourishes

31:06.610 --> 31:23.929
you, She cleanses you, because in this being
of yours, God Himself is going to manifest,

31:23.929 --> 31:33.879
because this temple of your body is to be
cleansed, because God has to enter into it.

31:33.879 --> 31:44.539
That’s why the Divine respects and cleanses
you and helps you.

31:44.539 --> 31:51.609
Even it may help yours, means say a mother
is there and her child is not all right, she’s

31:51.609 --> 31:57.629
worried, so the Divine may cure the child,
just to give peace to the mother who is going

31:57.629 --> 32:00.250
to manifest God’s powers.

32:00.250 --> 32:09.850
Because God’s power is the integrated power
of all the powers.

32:09.850 --> 32:24.159
You can see here, on the left hand side: all
the desires are manifested; the power of desire.

32:24.159 --> 32:32.970
That means all the desires you have can be
fulfilled and blessed by this power.

32:32.970 --> 32:37.529
Can you believe it?

32:37.529 --> 32:49.120
It has the power to fulfil all your desires,
but after Realisation, not before that.

32:49.120 --> 32:54.720
And after Realisation, your priorities change
and your desires become different.

32:54.720 --> 33:06.649
Then you do not ask for money or for children,
or something like that but you start asking

33:06.649 --> 33:11.669
for something of a very eternal nature.

33:11.669 --> 33:14.109
The priorities change.

33:14.109 --> 33:19.169
You start seeing your desire in a different
aspect because light has come now.

33:19.169 --> 33:25.019
For example, in the darkness when you are
walking, you find that there’s a big black

33:25.019 --> 33:29.970
bang in front of you, you can’t walk, so
you desire, “Oh this bang should be removed!”

33:29.970 --> 33:33.159
But when the light comes in you find there’s
no bang, nothing!

33:33.159 --> 33:35.049
It’s all open for you.

33:35.049 --> 33:44.320
So your desire is that you should be able
to see everything.

33:44.320 --> 33:45.320
The whole priority changes.

33:45.320 --> 33:52.999
So this Left Side has the power to fulfil
all your desires.

33:52.999 --> 34:07.950
And the Right Side, where you see this yellow
line, which looks so slender, has the power

34:07.950 --> 34:20.030
to act, to fulfil all your desires and the
desires of God.

34:20.030 --> 34:33.160
Here I take you a little subtler: What are
these acting powers?

34:33.160 --> 34:34.430
Tremendous!

34:34.430 --> 34:42.220
For example, this side is manifesting all
the five elements.

34:42.220 --> 34:47.610
All the five elements await your asking.

34:47.610 --> 34:51.580
You see this fire?

34:51.580 --> 34:54.810
You ask this fire, “Take away my problem!”

34:54.810 --> 34:56.190
It takes away.

34:56.190 --> 34:58.370
You have seen it.

34:58.370 --> 35:07.050
Water element: you go to the sea, and just
go and stand in the sea, after Realisation.

35:07.050 --> 35:10.410
You find the whole thing is sucked in.

35:10.410 --> 35:13.260
The Mother Earth sucks all your problems.

35:13.260 --> 35:14.480
It’s so fantastic.

35:14.480 --> 35:18.190
I was in Kuala Lumpur, you may write to him
and find out.

35:18.190 --> 35:22.270
He was the speaker of the assembly: [I was]
at his residence, and there were at least

35:22.270 --> 35:24.110
thousand people.

35:24.110 --> 35:28.250
And sixty percent were sick, and forty were
attending to them.

35:28.250 --> 35:31.460
I was alone: no Sahaja Yogi, nothing.

35:31.460 --> 35:35.600
Luckily, they had a big garden and it was
quite warm day.

35:35.600 --> 35:37.910
I said, “All right, let’s go in the garden!”

35:37.910 --> 35:41.760
I made them sit in the garden and I asked
the Mother Earth: I said, “You better now

35:41.760 --> 35:42.760
do the job!

35:42.760 --> 35:45.990
And I am sitting down."

35:45.990 --> 35:51.310
And everybody started feeling better.

35:51.310 --> 36:03.850
One thing I had never before seen being cured
was this polio.

36:03.850 --> 36:07.780
And a little boy, about eight years of age
was sitting on the ground: his parents had

36:07.780 --> 36:10.050
brought him on their back and put him down
there.

36:10.050 --> 36:12.600
He just got up and started walking!

36:12.600 --> 36:22.170
And the parents suddenly realised he’s missing:
“Where is he gone?”

36:22.170 --> 36:25.030
And he was running in the garden!

36:25.030 --> 36:26.030
It’s a fact!

36:26.030 --> 36:27.340
Some blind started seeing things.

36:27.340 --> 36:28.340
It’s most remarkable.

36:28.340 --> 36:33.540
You may write to him, I will give you his
address.

36:33.540 --> 36:37.020
It’s a fact, it happened.

36:37.020 --> 36:38.020
And for everyone the whole miracle was so
simple that they took it for granted; they

36:38.020 --> 36:41.100
didn’t find that there was anything so fantastic:
“After all Mother is here, so it has to

36:41.100 --> 36:42.330
work out!”

36:42.330 --> 36:45.381
They did not rationalise it or anything — took
it for granted.

36:45.381 --> 36:58.100
And even today, if I go there, this may happen.

36:58.100 --> 37:09.230
All the elements are waiting for your orders.

37:09.230 --> 37:19.560
So the great angels on the left hand side
communicate to the right hand side angels:

37:19.560 --> 37:20.610
all the angels of the world.

37:20.610 --> 37:27.020
Though it may sound fantastic to many, but
they exist, and you have to just ask their

37:27.020 --> 37:28.020
help.

37:28.020 --> 37:36.610
That is what is a mantra: is the awakened
calling, or you can say, calling which has

37:36.610 --> 37:37.610
meaning.

37:37.610 --> 37:44.860
For example: a policeman blows his whistle,
it has a meaning, but anybody else starts

37:44.860 --> 37:52.570
whistling, people will put him in the jail.

37:52.570 --> 38:02.990
In the same way, the mantra is the authority
which is applied with the word.

38:02.990 --> 38:09.590
And with this you can awaken all these forces
within you.

38:09.590 --> 38:15.560
They are so tremendous that I’ll take at
least seven lectures to describe [and] which

38:15.560 --> 38:23.000
I will describe some time; of which you are
aware already, most of you: how they work

38:23.000 --> 38:25.830
and how they help you.

38:25.830 --> 38:36.830
Even we take them for granted, Sahaja Yogis,
because if you notice in life, has one great

38:36.830 --> 38:46.380
mystery, I don’t know if you are aware of
that mystery: that whatever fantastic we get,

38:46.380 --> 38:54.800
somehow or other, we get it in such a way
that we take it for granted.

38:54.800 --> 38:56.610
It’s very sweet, isn’t it?

38:56.610 --> 39:04.920
Supposing every time we get a shock or we
get frightened, and we say, “Oh God!”

39:04.920 --> 39:08.790
We would become neurotic, or funny people.

39:08.790 --> 39:16.890
But the way it settles down within us like
a leaf falling from the tree and drying out

39:16.890 --> 39:22.590
and just touches the ground softly, and the
ground also takes it for granted.

39:22.590 --> 39:26.230
In the same way, all this we take for granted.

39:26.230 --> 39:30.910
For example, our eyes, our nose, our forehead,
everything we take for granted, our human

39:30.910 --> 39:35.690
bearing, everything we take it for granted,
in the same way take even Sahaj Yog for granted:

39:35.690 --> 39:41.490
and that’s the best way.

39:41.490 --> 39:48.830
But do we take it for granted, the way we
take our being for granted?

39:48.830 --> 39:51.000
Is the question.

39:51.000 --> 39:58.660
For example, we take it for granted our hand:
so if I have to lift my purse, I lift my hand,

39:58.660 --> 39:59.660
like this.

39:59.660 --> 40:05.920
When we take Sahaja Yoga for granted, do we
use our vibrations for everything?

40:05.920 --> 40:12.420
Because now in our vibratory awareness, if
we have taken it for granted, we should completely

40:12.420 --> 40:14.620
stand in it and work it out.

40:14.620 --> 40:16.810
I mean, I do that way.

40:16.810 --> 40:19.980
To me everything is nothing but vibrations.

40:19.980 --> 40:23.670
Everything I do is nothing but vibrations.

40:23.670 --> 40:29.910
All my movements and everything is nothing
but vibrations.

40:29.910 --> 40:34.660
I take for granted Myself very well.

40:34.660 --> 40:40.930
I wish you could take for granted all that
is within you, the way we take [other things]

40:40.930 --> 40:41.930
for granted.

40:41.930 --> 40:47.900
Say, I give you a television and you just
take it and you put it to the mains and you

40:47.900 --> 40:49.030
see the thing.

40:49.030 --> 40:56.840
You do not jump and say, “Oh God, look at
the miracle!

40:56.840 --> 40:57.840
Imagine!”

40:57.840 --> 41:00.060
Nothing, you just take it for granted.

41:00.060 --> 41:07.140
Anything: computer or any marvellous thing
that you see — you take it for granted.

41:07.140 --> 41:18.320
In the same way, maybe in the beginning one
feels, “How is it possible?”

41:18.320 --> 41:22.600
One may start thinking like that for a while.

41:22.600 --> 41:29.000
Too much thinking is also not good, because
then you are not take it for granted.

41:29.000 --> 41:34.740
But afterwards, you must use it left and right!

41:34.740 --> 41:36.400
Just try!

41:36.400 --> 41:37.540
You are empowered.

41:37.540 --> 41:39.060
Now your television is open.

41:39.060 --> 41:40.640
It has started working.

41:40.640 --> 41:53.620
You are a great instrument and created [over]
thousands of years with such care.

41:53.620 --> 41:59.830
You do not know what forces have been used:
how delicately and how dynamically.

41:59.830 --> 42:10.920
You have no idea as to how all the stars and
all the heavens are moved up and down to create

42:10.920 --> 42:15.040
this beautiful being that is the human personality.

42:15.040 --> 42:22.260
You have no idea of that.

42:22.260 --> 42:25.420
And now, when Sahaj Yoga takes place, also
you must know that Sahaj Yoga’s working

42:25.420 --> 42:32.200
has been worked out in the very dynamic manner.

42:32.200 --> 42:36.760
There are tremendous subtle forces which are
working it out.

42:36.760 --> 42:43.320
You cannot make your Kundalini pulsate without
something special happening there.

42:43.320 --> 42:49.030
Just think of a remote control that works
out your Kundalini!

42:49.030 --> 42:53.950
Just think of it!

42:53.950 --> 43:02.810
There must be a tremendous mechanism!

43:02.810 --> 43:09.540
Why I say, take it for granted [is] because
if you try first to open all your remote controls

43:09.540 --> 43:20.690
and see for yourself and then breaking all
of them, you start starting your television,

43:20.690 --> 43:24.790
you will find the whole thing is finished
and you have a headache, and you don’t want

43:24.790 --> 43:26.040
to see anything.

43:26.040 --> 43:32.500
That’s what happens to Sahaj Yogis, specially
in the West, because as soon as they get their

43:32.500 --> 43:38.140
Realisation they go home and make a nice dissection
by thinking about it.

43:38.140 --> 43:41.380
They didn’t get Realisation by thinking!

43:41.380 --> 43:43.550
It’s a simple thing!

43:43.550 --> 43:45.930
And then they go back.

43:45.930 --> 43:49.830
And then after seven months they come back
and say, “Mother I have been to you seven

43:49.830 --> 43:58.660
months back, now I think I was wrong."

43:58.660 --> 44:09.600
So I say: why lose those seven months?

44:09.600 --> 44:16.340
Today I hope you all will feel our subtleties
flowering.

44:16.340 --> 44:25.010
Let us take ourselves down to those subtle
points which we respected and the Kundalini

44:25.010 --> 44:28.620
will nourish it — the attention.

44:28.620 --> 44:35.830
Wherever your attention goes now, this attention
is enlightened attention.

44:35.830 --> 44:40.520
Today I received a letter from Australia,
somebody has written, “Mother, we had sent

44:40.520 --> 44:49.920
you a picture of someone, husband and wife,
and they are better since you gave them bandhan."

44:49.920 --> 44:52.990
And they were very serious patients.

44:52.990 --> 44:56.070
And they are really better.

44:56.070 --> 44:58.540
But I did nothing!

44:58.540 --> 45:01.620
Really I don’t do anything.

45:01.620 --> 45:05.350
I just looked at the photograph, that’s
all.

45:05.350 --> 45:09.280
I didn’t even give bandhan, you know, to
be very frank.

45:09.280 --> 45:10.280
I just looked at it, that’s all.

45:10.280 --> 45:13.070
I didn’t think, I just looked at it, and
it worked.

45:13.070 --> 45:14.950
Really I don’t do anything!

45:14.950 --> 45:18.141
You people thank me for nothing at all, you
know.

45:18.141 --> 45:21.250
When you don’t do anything and people thank
you, you don’t know what to say so you go

45:21.250 --> 45:25.050
on saying, “All right, thank you for thanking!”
(laughing)

45:25.050 --> 45:33.240
So again, thank you for being here.

45:33.240 --> 45:36.570
And we’ll have some meditation.

45:36.570 --> 45:42.400
I hope we’ll touch some deeper stratas within
yourselves.

45:42.400 --> 45:43.730
May God bless you all!

45:43.730 --> 45:51.520
You have come for the first time both of you?

45:51.520 --> 45:53.210
You have been once before?

45:53.210 --> 45:54.570
What about you?

45:54.570 --> 45:57.630
Lady: It’s my first time.

45:57.630 --> 46:00.080
Shri Mataji: First time?

46:00.080 --> 46:01.080
Good.

46:01.080 --> 46:02.080
Are you feeling the cool breeze?

46:02.080 --> 46:03.080
Seeker: Yes.

46:03.080 --> 46:04.080
Shri Mataji: All right, so you haven’t lost
it!

46:04.080 --> 46:06.170
And what about you, are you feeling the cool
breeze in the hand?

46:06.170 --> 46:07.170
Seeker: No

46:07.170 --> 46:08.310
Shri Mataji: Not yet?

46:08.310 --> 46:10.371
All right, it will work out, it will work
out.

46:10.371 --> 46:11.371
What about you?

46:11.371 --> 46:14.680
Are you feeling the cool breeze?

46:14.680 --> 46:15.990
No?

46:15.990 --> 46:18.170
How are you?

46:18.170 --> 46:20.053
Yogi: Feeling the cool breeze Mother.

46:20.053 --> 46:21.053
Shri Mataji: Well good!

46:21.053 --> 46:22.053
Good!

46:22.053 --> 46:23.053
Good!

46:23.053 --> 46:24.053
Are you all right?

46:24.053 --> 46:25.620
Good.What about you?

46:25.620 --> 46:27.190
Lady: I don’t feel today.

46:27.190 --> 46:28.341
Shri Mataji: You are thinking!

46:28.341 --> 46:29.341
Now, please!

46:29.341 --> 46:30.341
Please!

46:30.341 --> 46:33.960
You see, thinking stops it.

46:33.960 --> 46:35.260
How?

46:35.260 --> 46:41.830
Between the two thoughts — for example,
a thought rises and falls off, and another

46:41.830 --> 46:49.590
thought rises and falls off — between these
two thoughts there is a little gap, that gap

46:49.590 --> 46:50.590
has expanded.

46:50.590 --> 46:56.340
For example, the thought that was, is the
past and that is going to come is the future.

46:56.340 --> 47:00.920
In between is the space called as vilamba.

47:00.920 --> 47:05.320
And when you start thinking about it you jump
onto the cusp of these thoughts.

47:05.320 --> 47:08.480
You are beyond thought.

47:08.480 --> 47:18.900
An Indian will understand it faster, because
it’s called as Nirvichar Samadhi: is the

47:18.900 --> 47:20.920
state where you become thoughtlessly aware.

47:20.920 --> 47:22.950
They know that that’s what it is.

47:22.950 --> 47:26.850
You cannot think about it, because rationality
is a limited thing.

47:26.850 --> 47:32.280
So you have to jump into the space.

47:32.280 --> 47:37.470
When you are in the space then you are not
in the capsule.

47:37.470 --> 47:41.690
But if you are in the capsule you are not
in the space.

47:41.690 --> 47:44.650
Better now?

47:44.650 --> 47:47.600
Lady: Yes.

47:47.600 --> 47:56.680
Shri Mataji: See how it works.

47:56.680 --> 48:01.400
Even your problems, I mean, I have given big
lectures on this, how to solve your problems,

48:01.400 --> 48:02.900
in your thoughtless awareness.

48:02.900 --> 48:11.500
That’s the mouth, that’s the mouth where
you have to put the problem in, and it works

48:11.500 --> 48:13.870
in your thoughtless awareness.

48:13.870 --> 48:20.020
It’s the most precious thing, is to keep
it up.

48:20.020 --> 48:26.590
Are you getting now cool breeze?

48:26.590 --> 48:27.690
Correct.

48:27.690 --> 48:29.900
What about you, not yet?

48:29.900 --> 48:30.900
Now watch me here.

48:30.900 --> 48:32.460
Are you thinking still?

48:32.460 --> 48:34.830
All right, you watch me without thinking.

48:34.830 --> 48:36.930
That’s another way you can do it.

48:36.930 --> 48:41.790
My face is such a funny thing that if you
watch it for a long time, you will have no

48:41.790 --> 48:42.790
thoughts!

48:42.790 --> 48:45.070
Just it is something very funny you know!

48:45.070 --> 48:50.550
Today it happened: I went to the tailor and
he just looked at me and he didn’t know

48:50.550 --> 48:52.650
what he was trying to do.

48:52.650 --> 49:00.360
And my husband said, “Is he stunned or what
happened?”

49:00.360 --> 49:01.360
(laughter)

49:01.360 --> 49:04.580
Now watch me without thinking!

49:04.580 --> 49:06.830
Better!

49:06.830 --> 49:09.070
See!

49:09.070 --> 49:14.440
This is the face!

49:14.440 --> 49:16.630
This is needed.

49:16.630 --> 49:18.860
What am I to do?

49:18.860 --> 49:24.180
I mean, this is the problem with me.

49:24.180 --> 49:28.430
I don’t know how to explain myself!

49:28.430 --> 49:29.510
Aap ka aa rahe thanda?

49:29.510 --> 49:30.510
Thik hai.

49:30.510 --> 49:31.950
(Hindi: Are you getting cool?

49:31.950 --> 49:32.950
Good!)

49:32.950 --> 49:33.950
How are you now?

49:33.950 --> 49:34.950
Better?

49:34.950 --> 49:35.950
Everyday you will be better and better and
better.

49:35.950 --> 49:36.950
How are you?

49:36.950 --> 49:37.950
Lady: A bit better.

49:37.950 --> 49:38.950
Not so good as yesterday.

49:38.950 --> 49:47.740
I felt a lot of cool breeze yesterday but
not so much today.

49:47.740 --> 49:51.750
Shri Mataji: So, that means you are going
down a little.

49:51.750 --> 49:52.750
All right?

49:52.750 --> 49:56.080
So now keep it up.

49:56.080 --> 50:04.960
You see, it is like a washing machine, I can
say.

50:04.960 --> 50:09.480
It goes round and round, a little bit, for
cleansing.

50:09.480 --> 50:10.480
All right?

50:10.480 --> 50:11.480
They call it Mahamaya.

50:11.480 --> 50:13.380
They call it “The Great Illusion”.

50:13.380 --> 50:15.640
Mother is a great illusion, because She puts
us into illusion.

50:15.640 --> 50:16.640
I do not!

50:16.640 --> 50:19.100
We tell God, “Lead us not into temptation."

50:19.100 --> 50:22.470
Now why will He take you to temptation?

50:22.470 --> 50:25.590
But you do go.

50:25.590 --> 50:29.350
So you tell God that, “You keep us away
from that!”

50:29.350 --> 50:32.580
That’s all you tell God: that, “You keep
us away from thinking!”

50:32.580 --> 50:44.590
And it works.

50:44.590 --> 50:50.540
Better?

50:50.540 --> 50:52.620
Your face looks different immediately.

50:52.620 --> 50:55.640
Keep it up!

50:55.640 --> 50:58.660
Now all right.

50:58.660 --> 51:02.690
Good, once it clicks!

51:02.690 --> 51:04.370
But you must come every Monday.

51:04.370 --> 51:05.520
See how people have gone up!

51:05.520 --> 51:07.500
How many people they are giving Realisation?

51:07.500 --> 51:09.180
All right?

51:09.180 --> 51:16.740
You must come, this is the most pleasurable
thing!

51:16.740 --> 51:17.740
You don’t know.

51:17.740 --> 51:20.460
It is little bit you have to develop the taste.

51:20.460 --> 51:23.470
Because you are used to the gross stuff, you
see.

51:23.470 --> 51:27.570
Like somebody who is used to wines cannot
give up.

51:27.570 --> 51:34.670
But once the wine from within starts pouring
in, you just don’t want it!

51:34.670 --> 51:36.830
Better.

51:36.830 --> 51:44.490
Somebody has come I believe.

51:44.490 --> 51:46.360
Hmmm!

51:46.360 --> 51:51.960
He’s better now.

51:51.960 --> 51:55.700
All right?

51:55.700 --> 52:01.310
What’s happened Gavin?

52:01.310 --> 52:03.960
I see that so clear!

52:03.960 --> 52:04.960
Why?

52:04.960 --> 52:05.960
You’ve been having a holiday or what?

52:05.960 --> 52:07.590
It’s horrible, absolutely!

52:07.590 --> 52:11.220
Very badly caught up!

52:11.220 --> 52:13.050
What’s the matter?

52:13.050 --> 52:16.590
You had a bad cold?

52:16.590 --> 52:18.970
Come here!

52:18.970 --> 52:24.930
I have never seen you being caught that much.

52:24.930 --> 52:41.720
You had exposed yourself I think [it was]
the sunning or what happened?

52:41.720 --> 52:48.920
Terrible!

52:48.920 --> 52:56.130
Better?

52:56.130 --> 52:57.130
Be careful!

52:57.130 --> 53:02.760
You see, these days it’s very sunny, looks
sunny, but maybe…You have to look after

53:02.760 --> 53:03.760
yourself.

53:03.760 --> 53:06.450
This country is full of this problem.

53:06.450 --> 53:10.190
Now better.

53:10.190 --> 53:13.940
What’s it?

53:13.940 --> 53:15.810
Vishuddhi.

53:15.810 --> 53:27.050
It rises from Vishuddhi to this.

53:27.050 --> 53:28.920
Haa!

53:28.920 --> 53:32.670
Better now.

53:32.670 --> 53:58.060
You sit or a while and it will work out in
the…You see it rises from the Vishuddhi

53:58.060 --> 53:59.060
to the.

53:59.060 --> 54:04.610
I think you caught cold very badly.

54:04.610 --> 54:06.790
What happened?

54:06.790 --> 54:12.260
Gavin Brown: I don’t know.

54:12.260 --> 54:22.110
Shri Mataji: I think you put your hand here.

54:22.110 --> 54:24.300
Sit down!

54:24.300 --> 54:25.300
Be careful.

54:25.300 --> 54:26.300
Hmm!

54:26.300 --> 54:27.300
Better.

54:27.300 --> 54:28.590
Somebody with cold must have come or something
you see, or the hay fever is there.

54:28.590 --> 54:32.390
Gavin Brown: Might be that.

54:32.390 --> 54:37.430
Shri Mataji: From Right Nabhi: it’s on the
right hand side the problem is.

54:37.430 --> 54:41.300
How are you?

54:41.300 --> 54:44.650
Good!

54:44.650 --> 55:04.800
Now close your eyes, close.

55:04.800 --> 55:15.580
You put your hand here, the right, and the
left there to work out the Vishuddhi.

55:15.580 --> 55:19.010
Right Nabhi also.

55:19.010 --> 55:23.560
Is it your liver coming up or what?

55:23.560 --> 55:31.060
Gavin Brown: I don’t think so.

55:31.060 --> 55:38.560
Shri Mataji: Quite a lot eh?

55:38.560 --> 55:42.310
Gavin Brown: Hmm.

55:42.310 --> 55:52.310
Shri Mataji: All right, move from the left
more, from the left.

55:52.310 --> 55:57.620
Keep your eyes shut and enjoy your Self, enjoy
your Self.

55:57.620 --> 55:59.270
Just don’t think.

55:59.270 --> 56:01.380
Just don’t think.

56:01.380 --> 56:08.830
Just enjoy your Self.

56:08.830 --> 56:13.720
Don’t think.

56:13.720 --> 56:18.600
Don’t think.

56:18.600 --> 56:21.040
Hmm!

56:21.040 --> 56:23.480
Better.

56:23.480 --> 56:33.250
Where is it Mark?

56:33.250 --> 56:38.140
Whole Left?

56:38.140 --> 56:43.020
Better now?

56:43.020 --> 56:45.460
Improving?

56:45.460 --> 56:47.910
Heart?

56:47.910 --> 56:50.350
Better.

56:50.350 --> 57:00.120
Keep your eyes shut!

57:00.120 --> 57:07.440
Enjoy your Self.

57:07.440 --> 57:14.080
You are all going down into your Self.

57:14.080 --> 57:15.430
Just allow it.

57:15.430 --> 57:17.310
Relax, relax.

57:17.310 --> 57:19.190
Just relax.

57:19.190 --> 57:29.480
Don’t think about anything just relax.

57:29.480 --> 58:11.200
You are working it out.

58:11.200 --> 58:36.230
Now just relax.

58:36.230 --> 58:52.920
Don’t think.

58:52.920 --> 59:09.600
Better now.

59:09.600 --> 59:17.950
Tremendous!

59:17.950 --> 59:26.290
Haa?

59:26.290 --> 59:42.980
Giving out.

59:42.980 --> 59:51.320
Better.

59:51.320 --> 01:00:16.350
Now, better now?

01:00:16.350 --> 01:01:28.410
Now are

01:01:28.410 --> 01:01:29.800
you feeling?

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:30.970
Better?

01:01:30.970 --> 01:01:33.300
Losing again?

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:35.710
You are losing again?

01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:37.650
What?

01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:42.550
Come up, come here.

01:01:42.550 --> 01:01:44.310
Sit down.

01:01:44.310 --> 01:01:46.080
Sit down.

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:58.450
See your liver comes back again: still treating
your liver patients there is it?

01:01:58.450 --> 01:01:59.710
Come forward, come forward.

01:01:59.710 --> 01:02:01.890
I’ll have to put my foot on your liver.

01:02:01.890 --> 01:02:03.830
Now just see how stone-like it has become.

01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:10.460
See now, what else do you expect but heat?

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:15.040
See?

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:33.370
That’s what it is.

01:02:33.370 --> 01:02:42.540
Now better?

01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:56.600
Somebody’s catching on the Back Agnya.

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:57.600
Hmm!

01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:58.600
Gavin Brown: It’s moving.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:02:59.600
It’s moving now.

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:00.600
Shri Mataji: Better?

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:01.600
Much better now.

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:02.600
Sorry I have to use my feet but they are very
powerful you know.

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.660
For physical problems they are better than
my hands are.

01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:17.180
Poor things, they go on working morning till
evening!

01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:31.220
Press it hard!

01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:35.900
Better!

01:03:35.900 --> 01:04:02.830
Still you are working with the liver patients
are they?

01:04:02.830 --> 01:04:04.480
Doctor: Hmm.

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:07.960
Shri Mataji: What do you do about them?

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:11.660
What treatments do you give for liver patients
in the hospitals?

01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:13.110
Doctor: Special drugs.

01:04:13.110 --> 01:04:15.030
Shri Mataji: What drugs?

01:04:15.030 --> 01:04:17.940
Doctor: Depends what the problem is with the
liver.

01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:19.923
Shri Mataji: But still what drugs normally
you use?

01:04:19.923 --> 01:04:30.310
Doctor: The main things they use are for someone
who is alcoholic and they start to bleed.

01:04:30.310 --> 01:04:31.310
Shri Mataji: Alcohol?

01:04:31.310 --> 01:04:33.620
Doctor: They have alcoholic cirrhosis and
they bleed and they vomit blood.

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:34.620
Shri Mataji: Really?

01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:35.620
That serious?

01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:46.670
Doctor: So we have special drugs to help stop
that.

01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:56.460
Shri Mataji: Just look at this!

01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:58.430
Despite that, nobody publishes these things.

01:04:58.430 --> 01:05:05.460
You know, the other day in a very so-called
important dinner table, there was a big argument

01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:13.500
[that] was on that, in France, the pubs are
open all the time, while here they open very

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:18.770
late, so people are very unhappy that you
are not sufficiently alcoholic!

01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:21.590
A big discussion is on.

01:05:21.590 --> 01:05:23.170
Let them see these photographs!

01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:30.050
Why not show them how people vomit blood and
how people do these things.

01:05:30.050 --> 01:05:35.730
It would be a good idea.

01:05:35.730 --> 01:05:36.730
And the food they eat do they?

01:05:36.730 --> 01:05:42.710
Doctor: Well, there’s so many different
problems we have with the liver.

01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:48.657
Say, they are alcoholic then they have intravenous
therapy.

01:05:48.657 --> 01:05:49.657
Shri Mataji: They cannot eat the food?

01:05:49.657 --> 01:05:50.657
They vomit?

01:05:50.657 --> 01:05:51.657
Doctor: So they put special tubes down them
to stop them vomiting, and then they give

01:05:51.657 --> 01:05:51.950
them blood because they are losing so much.
