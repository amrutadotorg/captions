1
00:00:07,619 --> 00:00:12,780
So we have to give up our misidentifications with our previous styles of life,

2
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:18,935
previous type of living, previous type of executing any work

3
00:00:19,015 --> 00:00:22,790
and we have to understand that we are not to plan.

4
00:00:22,876 --> 00:00:29,865
This house is built for Me. I’m the power behind the whole universe,

5
00:00:29,945 --> 00:00:33,359
so you don’t have to plan, you just start off.

6
00:00:33,445 --> 00:00:39,917
But once you start planning then you depend 
on yourselves, which is a very limited thing.

7
00:00:39,997 --> 00:00:44,371
You just start planning and you are left behind.

8
00:00:44,451 --> 00:00:45,726
Just get to it.

9
00:00:45,806 --> 00:00:51,697
When you start thinking of any problems and all that, 
then you are lagging behind. Just start off

10
00:00:51,784 --> 00:00:55,543
and everything will come forward, 
you’ll find everything it will all be there

11
00:00:55,623 --> 00:00:58,060
just before you, before your eyes.

12
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:04,018
Like the other day they said we don’t find a wood 
we need very much of a particular thickness.

13
00:01:04,104 --> 00:01:09,851
And they were trying to sort of reduce 
the thickness by rubbing it

14
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:17,426
with some very, very harsh type of noisy stuff, 
which nobody could bear.

15
00:01:17,512 --> 00:01:23,141
So, I just said, “What, what kind of a thing you want? See ahead of you.”

16
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:27,043
And just in front of them was lying that same type of wood that they wanted.

17
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:32,085
Just ahead of them. It was just there. You see how it’s happening? What’s working out?

18
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:34,958
It’s the Hanumana who works out many things for you.

19
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:41,083
It is the Gauri who is to be adored. And it’s the duty 
of Hanumana to help you out. He plays tricks with you.

20
00:01:41,163 --> 00:01:45,709
Always, you see he is the one who makes you think, 
he makes you plan,

21
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:48,268
he makes you everything and then topples you down.

22
00:01:48,355 --> 00:01:54,242
You see, that is his style, always. 
And he has made mischief with so many people like that.

23
00:01:54,322 --> 00:02:00,394
You see, he made them think, plan, plan, plan, plan 
and ultimately they find all plans fail.

24
00:02:00,494 --> 00:02:04,118
So, if you are too organized, you’ll never enjoy.

25
00:02:04,198 --> 00:02:09,699
You have to enjoy each other’s company, 
you have to enjoy all little little things there are.

26
00:02:09,779 --> 00:02:15,712
If there is everything perfect, or absolutely sort of a machine-like,

27
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:19,400
when you go on tick-tick-tick-tick-finished, there’s no enjoyment.

28
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,203
You have to lose your way somewhere. You have to find something out.

29
00:02:24,283 --> 00:02:27,548
You have to go about, you have to ask someone.

30
00:02:27,628 --> 00:02:31,774
Like making mistakes also is important. Sometimes if you make mistakes,

31
00:02:31,854 --> 00:02:36,462
like somebody makes mistake by putting the thing in an angular way,

32
00:02:36,542 --> 00:02:42,262
a decoration in an angular way, 
and it turned out to be a very beautiful thing, you see.

33
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:46,652
So making mistakes is also good. 
This is what I’m trying to show to all of you.

34
00:02:46,732 --> 00:02:51,315
By mistake also, if you are driven to someplace 
you might find something very great.

35
00:02:51,315 --> 00:02:55,254
So, our time is never wasted. Wherever we are, we are.

36
00:02:55,334 --> 00:02:58,565
We are never lost. We are never lost for anything.

37
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,227
Time stops for us.

38
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:07,411
So once you understand that we are not to worry 
about these things, which the people worry.

39
00:03:07,492 --> 00:03:13,235
We are not to worry about things for which people just give their lives.

40
00:03:13,315 --> 00:03:16,887
We are here for joy. And joy will come to us, whatever it is.

41
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:22,668
So we should seek joy, happiness, friendship 
and this is a very, very good opportunity.
