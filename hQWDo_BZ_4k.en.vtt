00:09.643 --> 00:15.115
The other day at the ashram I spoke to you
about Easter,

00:15.316 --> 00:19.713
about the birth of Christ and
His resurrection

00:19.914 --> 00:24.029
and the message of Christianity that is
resurrection.

00:27.950 --> 00:35.531
An egg is a very significant thing and
it is written

00:35.795 --> 00:41.787
in one of the ancient scriptures in India

00:41.988 --> 00:51.121
why Easter should be celebrated with
an egg. Is most surprising.

00:51.322 --> 01:00.326
It's very clear there if one can see how
Christ is symbolized as an egg.

01:02.152 --> 01:05.160
Now what is an egg?

01:05.885 --> 01:11.922
In Sanskrit language, a Brahmin is called
as dwijaha.

01:12.123 --> 01:18.276
Dwihi jayeti means the one who is born
twice.

01:18.477 --> 01:27.460
And a bird is also called, any bird, is
called as a dwija, means twice born.

01:27.661 --> 01:35.787
Because first the bird is born as an egg
and then reborn as a bird.

01:36.559 --> 01:42.095
In the same way a human being is born
as an egg

01:42.296 --> 01:48.569
and then is born as a realized soul.

01:49.897 --> 01:55.017
Now see how significant it is that both are
called by the same name.

01:55.218 --> 02:00.825
No other animal is called as dwija unless
and until it has an egg-form first

02:01.026 --> 02:07.719
and then it comes out as a... another
thing.

02:08.793 --> 02:12.599
For example no mammals,

02:14.268 --> 02:19.867
none of the mammals, are called as dwija
except for human beings.

02:20.068 --> 02:26.328
It is remarkable in the zoology if you read
that mammals do not lay their eggs,

02:26.529 --> 02:31.146
they give birth directly to their children.
And we are also mammals.

02:31.347 --> 02:39.564
But despite that, human beings are called
as dwijaha just like birds.

02:41.471 --> 02:50.624
So that means human beings, when they are
born are eggs, or they become eggs.

02:52.333 --> 02:55.503
How do they become eggs?

02:57.767 --> 03:01.908
Is the way our ego and superego develop
within us.

03:02.109 --> 03:06.380
Now you all being only Sahaj Yogis, I
think, you understand what I'm saying.

03:06.581 --> 03:11.663
When the ego and superego...
[ASIDE: What's this supposed to be?]

03:12.672 --> 03:17.797
When the ego and superego
[ASIDE: - there's no chart, is it?]

03:17.998 --> 03:25.570
develop in a human being, to the full
extent

03:25.771 --> 03:32.883
and the fontanel bone area is completely
calcified, then you become an egg.

03:33.084 --> 03:38.410
You get completely separated from your
Mother,

03:38.611 --> 03:47.872
from all the pervading power of God and
you are left to yourself as an egg

03:48.656 --> 03:55.342
till you mature within yourself inside
the shell of the egg, in your freedom,

03:55.543 --> 04:01.627
to a point where you are ready
for hatching.

04:01.828 --> 04:07.055
The Mother bird has to pierce on the head
of the egg

04:07.256 --> 04:11.963
and you come out as birds. You're already
there inside developed

04:12.163 --> 04:22.013
and then you fly out into the space
of All Pervading Power of Divine Love.

04:23.634 --> 04:29.862
So how significant is Easter, and why
Christ?

04:31.615 --> 04:39.237
He came on this earth because He had learnt
the idea,

04:39.935 --> 04:48.873
He had practiced the idea, or we can say
that He was an expert on this.

04:51.209 --> 04:54.179
That He could

04:57.022 --> 05:01.011
Himself surpass that hurdle

05:02.616 --> 05:09.407
by which He becomes [vadija/the dweeja],
but He was that already.

05:09.608 --> 05:16.166
But how are you to believe that you can be
dweejahas, you can be reborn?

05:16.367 --> 05:26.020
It was said by every religion, by every
prophet, that you are to be born again.

05:26.221 --> 05:29.170
Unless and until you are reborn -

05:29.371 --> 05:34.154
that means baptism, not this kind
of baptism but the real one -

05:34.355 --> 05:39.835
unless and until this shell is broken
on your fontanel area,

05:40.036 --> 05:43.562
you cannot become the dweejaha.

05:43.763 --> 05:50.710
Is written in all the scriptures, said by
all the prophets;

05:51.395 --> 05:55.565
somebody had to show you that this can
be done.

05:55.766 --> 06:03.980
He being the divine power itself,
the Pranava, He being the Brahma itself.

06:04.181 --> 06:09.628
His rebirth was resurrection, bodily
resurrection,

06:09.829 --> 06:18.421
while yours is a resurrection which is
in your consciousness.

06:22.153 --> 06:29.366
And you see it clearly. This is what is
Easter is.

06:29.567 --> 06:37.418
Now we have to face in Sahaja Yoga
ourselves in a full way.

06:38.151 --> 06:42.195
Christ was too great,

06:42.396 --> 06:48.939
but He came on this earth like an ordinary
human being,

06:49.140 --> 06:54.953
went through all the pains and pangs
of life,

06:55.154 --> 07:04.620
overcome the hurdle and became the eternal
life.

07:05.272 --> 07:13.398
He was eternal life and He became eternal
life and He is eternal life.

07:13.599 --> 07:19.828
But to show you that you have to also
become eternal life,

07:20.029 --> 07:26.207
your consciousness must reside in that
eternal life.

07:29.995 --> 07:35.309
That is only possible after realization

07:36.085 --> 07:41.367
if you know the value of that eternal life.

07:41.568 --> 07:47.549
If that is your priority, if that is
the highest

07:47.750 --> 07:52.816
and you have to achieve that and nothing
else.

07:53.668 --> 07:58.830
But actually we have been identified

07:59.031 --> 08:03.031
with so many things, like we can say
in the egg stage we had the yolk

08:03.232 --> 08:11.517
and all these things, and we got
contaminated by all the surroundings,

08:11.718 --> 08:18.859
that even when we are resurrected we cannot
identify our self with the open space,

08:19.060 --> 08:26.914
still our wings have to grow, still we are
afraid to fly.

08:28.487 --> 08:34.033
And at that time you are to be looked
after.

08:34.234 --> 08:41.207
But if you are prone to go back into
the egg stage, you can go back.

08:41.408 --> 08:49.359
This is the only difference between
a human egg and a bird's egg.

08:49.560 --> 08:54.222
Though I would say a realized soul never
loses his realization.

08:54.431 --> 08:58.471
But it can be so much overclouded

08:58.823 --> 09:06.130
that could be that the growth is stunted.

09:06.376 --> 09:13.749
The atmosphere in which you live
is responsible for that.

09:13.950 --> 09:19.010
You must have your own willpower. You must
have your own understanding,

09:19.211 --> 09:23.688
your own character to stand up to it.

09:23.896 --> 09:32.173
You'll be amazed that the chicken that
we eat cannot fly

09:32.374 --> 09:34.948
but if you want to see them in the forest
you'll be surprised

09:35.149 --> 09:37.904
they are one of the fastest moving birds.

09:38.105 --> 09:44.114
They are exactly the same as the chicken
we have in the house.

09:44.489 --> 09:48.317
No difference if you put both of them
together

09:48.518 --> 09:52.804
you'll find they are just the same -

09:53.709 --> 09:58.633
in the color, in their weight, in their
appearances,

09:58.834 --> 10:05.017
in the way they walk, everything. But you
put them together

10:05.218 --> 10:10.905
and at the slightest disturbance one will
take off very high up

10:11.106 --> 10:15.252
while the other would not know where to run
it will just parr? and go into a small place

10:15.453 --> 10:19.759
where it will be caught again and cut
and finished.

10:22.000 --> 10:29.435
So if human beings have to

10:31.422 --> 10:34.548
understand the importance of eternal life,

10:34.749 --> 10:42.052
they must know that they can change
the atmosphere.

10:43.054 --> 10:48.346
They are much more powerful than chickens
are, aren't they?

10:48.785 --> 10:53.280
Chickens can be dominated
by the atmosphere.

10:53.584 --> 11:02.901
But a realized soul, through his vibratory
awareness,

11:03.102 --> 11:08.566
through the radiations that are passing
through him can change the atmosphere.

11:08.767 --> 11:14.936
He can change his surroundings, he can
change his friends, he can change

11:15.137 --> 11:19.990
his parents, his brothers, sisters,
his relations, his surroundings -

11:20.191 --> 11:28.610
he can change his town, he can change his
country and he can change the whole world.

11:29.511 --> 11:33.010
Now the Sahaj Yogis have a special
responsibility

11:33.211 --> 11:40.695
because they are the first to transform
themselves. I mean the modern ones.

11:41.753 --> 11:45.565
The old ones who are realized souls do not
know Sahaj Yoga

11:45.766 --> 11:49.006
so they should not be called as Sahaj Yogis
because they don't know about Kundalini,

11:49.207 --> 11:51.964
they don't know how to raise the Kundalini,
they don't know anything.

11:52.165 --> 11:57.827
Moreover because they have certain amount
of consciousness

11:58.035 --> 12:03.330
that they are different from others,
either they are cynical or egoistical.

12:05.309 --> 12:12.782
So the responsibility of the Sahaj Yogis
of modern times is so great

12:12.983 --> 12:18.829
that they are the pivotal point, they are
the turning point.

12:19.030 --> 12:25.685
They are going to turn the wave, a wave
that can save or mar.

12:27.322 --> 12:30.684
One wave can mar,

12:31.059 --> 12:39.198
kill thousands of people by its upward
thrust

12:40.605 --> 12:48.612
towards a wrong direction and the same wave
can save them to the shore.

12:51.209 --> 12:58.444
So the responsibility is very great and
the importance of Sahaj Yogis

12:58.645 --> 13:04.866
is much greater than any saints who were
born on this earth before.

13:05.067 --> 13:08.132
Because other saints did not know

13:08.333 --> 13:14.051
that if they were irresponsible what would
happen to others.

13:15.265 --> 13:18.215
Some of them have written good books

13:18.416 --> 13:23.299
but I am sure, in between they have made
mistakes.

13:26.290 --> 13:33.141
Those saints who have been great and
realized souls

13:33.342 --> 13:39.323
did not know even one thousandth of what
you know about Kundalini

13:40.062 --> 13:42.311
and they did not even have the power

13:42.512 --> 13:45.885
to raise the Kundalini of others and give
them realization.

13:46.086 --> 13:53.225
Except for very few, like we can say John
the Baptist, we had,

13:54.123 --> 14:00.040
who would make people go headlong
into the water,

14:00.241 --> 14:03.292
into the water element to pierce them
first...

14:03.493 --> 14:07.446
Dip them inside nicely again and again

14:07.647 --> 14:10.204
and with his vibrations would raise
their Kundalini,

14:10.405 --> 14:17.405
but still I don't know if he gave
realization to anyone. He could give

14:17.606 --> 14:23.985
because none of the people at that time

14:24.186 --> 14:28.621
speak like realized souls, still they are
seeking,

14:28.822 --> 14:37.533
their seeking has not come to an end.
Still they are not knowing.

14:44.003 --> 14:49.451
In India there are many people who have
written about Self Realization.

14:49.652 --> 14:55.259
They were at a advantageous position
because there are lots of books about it.

14:55.460 --> 15:00.280
While the disciples of Christ did not have
that advantage

15:00.481 --> 15:06.476
otherwise they would have also written
a lot. But writing is not the main thing.

15:06.677 --> 15:12.428
You can make out a realized soul by the way
he speaks.

15:16.351 --> 15:20.917
If he's not a realized soul, if he’s still
half-baked you can find out.

15:21.118 --> 15:24.558
You can very easily find out a half-baked
Sahaj Yogi,

15:24.744 --> 15:28.539
as you can find out an egg which is rotten.

15:28.740 --> 15:32.866
You don't have to break it to find out
that it is smelling.

15:33.067 --> 15:39.521
You can see from the weight, you can make
it out

15:40.212 --> 15:48.983
if the egg is all right or not, even
by putting it in the water.

15:50.803 --> 15:56.936
There are so many simple methods of finding
out if the egg is rotten or not.

15:57.137 --> 16:03.205
There are some eggs which are about to be
rotten. Some are absolutely rotten

16:03.406 --> 16:09.694
and some are absolutely smelling. So forget
about them.

16:09.895 --> 16:14.654
Now one of the first things that happens
to realized souls is

16:14.855 --> 16:18.642
that their attention goes to the most
rotten ones, you see,

16:18.843 --> 16:23.585
and to oblige Me, they bring them down
to Me - the most rotten ones

16:23.786 --> 16:30.542
which are incorrigible and I go on
struggling with them.

16:33.520 --> 16:36.655
I do not know why such a psychology should
exist within us

16:36.856 --> 16:40.141
that we get the most difficult ones
to Mother,

16:40.342 --> 16:43.185
to present Her with the most challenging
task,

16:43.386 --> 16:47.728
to give Her the greatest holiest position.

16:47.929 --> 16:55.092
But, I have no regrets about it, neither
I have any complaints,

16:55.293 --> 17:00.923
but time is wasted, time is really wasted
quite a lot.

17:01.124 --> 17:05.434
So is better to find out people who are not
that rotten,

17:05.635 --> 17:13.968
to get people who are just all right,
not very much spoilt,

17:14.169 --> 17:19.268
otherwise if the shells are broken, if
the whole yolk has fallen down

17:19.476 --> 17:22.851
then how are we to gather it?

17:24.329 --> 17:30.914
Now we have most of the eggs quite safe

17:31.115 --> 17:34.634
but we have no way of approaching them,

17:35.755 --> 17:41.331
because the contamination that takes place
on these eggs

17:41.532 --> 17:48.972
is because of heat:

17:50.061 --> 17:52.796
they get spoilt.

17:53.472 --> 18:01.834
The heat as you have seen in the body also
is caused by diseases like cancer

18:02.715 --> 18:08.675
or anything that comes as heat from a Sahaj
Yogi means there's something wrong.

18:12.359 --> 18:21.397
And the warmth of the Mother bird only
gives realization

18:22.341 --> 18:30.456
to the little eggs as birds. In the same
way, it is the warmth

18:32.823 --> 18:39.823
of the divine love which does the job.

18:41.904 --> 18:51.456
But still human beings do not realize
the importance,

18:52.177 --> 19:02.124
best are those who fly at the first
opening.

19:02.325 --> 19:09.918
Those who do not, sit down and sulk and
think and analyze

19:10.417 --> 19:17.419
or afraid or frightened or start wondering
their progress is very slow.

19:17.620 --> 19:22.902
Because at the instant of their birth is
a tremendous force behind him

19:23.103 --> 19:29.057
and they can easily go out. But if you sulk
and think of your fears,

19:29.258 --> 19:37.296
the fear will settle down in your limbs and
in your wings and you cannot fly.

19:37.497 --> 19:44.559
The thinking and analysis that is going on
after Realization

19:44.760 --> 19:48.322
makes the wings very heavy.

19:48.642 --> 19:54.410
That's why I've seen people who get
Realization in the villages of India,

19:54.611 --> 19:58.009
where the people are least complicated,

19:58.210 --> 20:04.294
take to their wings without any fear, just
there I find they are flying in the air,

20:04.495 --> 20:10.270
and they manage to learn flying as if it is
their birthright.

20:10.471 --> 20:14.503
They are just there - no problem.

20:17.711 --> 20:21.978
Whenever they want they can come down,
and again be there.

20:22.194 --> 20:27.831
But those who become heavy

20:28.032 --> 20:34.458
with fears or with egos and their
misidentifications,

20:34.983 --> 20:40.212
fly a little, again flop down - fly
a little, again flop down.

20:40.413 --> 20:45.769
Every time they flop down something happens
to them, they are hurt,

20:45.970 --> 20:51.537
they try to hurt Me by blaming Me for what
has happened to them.

20:51.738 --> 20:55.058
This is the worst part of it.

20:56.028 --> 21:01.850
Because they think I asked them to fly,
that's why they have fallen down.

21:03.129 --> 21:09.953
I give even that much concession because
they are still young, still

21:12.082 --> 21:19.345
quite naive, but best thing is to take to
your wings as soon as you get Realization.

21:19.546 --> 21:22.022
Now why I'm telling you this,

21:22.223 --> 21:27.542
specially to the people who have already
achieved quite a lot,

21:27.743 --> 21:32.538
because you took lot of time, most of you.

21:32.993 --> 21:37.179
So now when you bring new people, when
you talk to new people,

21:37.380 --> 21:43.860
tell them that, "We have done all these
mistakes and we were real slow masters.

21:44.061 --> 21:49.126
And we used to walk three paces forward
and four paces backwards.

21:49.327 --> 21:58.128
Now we would request you to take to this
flight and have the joy."

21:58.528 --> 22:08.546
The third thing which is very important
to be understood is that, that the mind

22:09.649 --> 22:16.892
which is so confused-a-terminology, I don't
know what English word "mind" means,

22:17.093 --> 22:23.944
but if you think mind is your intellect
by which you think, is the buddhi,

22:24.938 --> 22:32.857
then this mind has had many ramblings,
in the West, specially.

22:33.058 --> 22:39.109
So the complication is much worse because
the mind has gone round and round and round.

22:40.468 --> 22:48.761
So the first impact of Realization, of this
resurrection, is seldom of joy.

22:48.962 --> 22:54.021
And even if it is of joy, one comes down.

22:55.745 --> 23:03.012
It may be in many cases that the joy comes
only for an hour or so,

23:03.213 --> 23:06.890
and then you come back to your position.

23:07.091 --> 23:10.735
Then again you start rising, now when
you start rising

23:10.936 --> 23:15.034
you face your complications and your
complicated methods.

23:15.235 --> 23:17.712
First of all, your priorities have been
wrong

23:17.913 --> 23:21.136
because of your intellectual ways of doing
things.

23:21.337 --> 23:31.091
Priorities like wasting your energy
on petty things as we do always.

23:32.120 --> 23:36.246
Say... "now this is not fixed properly."

23:36.946 --> 23:41.623
So... just to lose temper on that.

23:43.507 --> 23:47.799
Somebody comes late, then you are angry.

23:48.000 --> 23:53.613
The norms, you see, that are made
as important,

23:53.814 --> 23:58.913
that you have to be in time, "time is very
important" - for what?

23:59.114 --> 24:02.188
Because we won the war, Waterloo war,
because of time.

24:02.389 --> 24:05.071
But nobody's going to fight here a war,
do you see?

24:05.272 --> 24:08.035
We are not doing the same jobs what
these people were doing, you see,

24:08.236 --> 24:11.404
we are not soldiers who had to fight a war,

24:11.605 --> 24:14.932
we are soldiers of patience.

24:15.225 --> 24:23.496
So time is the... identification is too
much with to-the-dot time business.

24:23.697 --> 24:28.922
Then there are double forces which comes
into play.

24:29.123 --> 24:38.503
One is your identification with the time
and the other is My play of befooling you.

24:38.712 --> 24:43.826
You'll never get things in time after
Realization.

24:44.646 --> 24:50.492
It will be all untimely, then you will
realize that it was stupidity.

24:50.693 --> 24:54.940
Because straight away you do not
understand.

24:56.529 --> 24:59.788
Simple identification like time, if you go
little further with it,

24:59.989 --> 25:04.260
see now in Kundalini what is the timing?

25:04.461 --> 25:06.973
Can you say what time you are going to get
your Realization?

25:07.174 --> 25:10.270
At what time exactly according to watch.

25:10.471 --> 25:15.352
My watch is... just now is 7:30

25:15.553 --> 25:21.811
but it could be 7, could be quarter to 7,
could be 6, could be 1.

25:22.701 --> 25:26.974
It's My own watch I'll have it the way
I want to.

25:28.080 --> 25:34.625
In the same way, you are not to be
the slave of the watch.

25:36.571 --> 25:40.515
Now, the timing...

25:41.255 --> 25:48.879
if you try other tricks also, any such
things like foolish things like that.

25:52.865 --> 25:59.114
For example, people are very particular
about the mannerism of others,

25:59.315 --> 26:02.231
not their own, but about others.

26:02.432 --> 26:05.844
If the other has a little peculiar
mannerism, finished -

26:06.045 --> 26:09.201
then they have no patience for that person.

26:09.408 --> 26:15.536
It is so outside a person, because you are
not seeing the inside of a person.

26:18.030 --> 26:22.147
And when these misidentifications stick
onto you too much,

26:22.348 --> 26:25.238
then I have to do something about it,
isn't it?

26:25.439 --> 26:29.194
I mean what - there's no other way but
to play tricks with you.

26:29.395 --> 26:32.548
Then you get confused with Sahaj Yoga.

26:32.749 --> 26:35.694
You think, "Oh, I was very much all right,
what's the matter?"

26:35.895 --> 26:39.714
There was a lady in America whom I gave
Realization.

26:39.915 --> 26:41.399
She was an Indian lady running a shop,

26:41.600 --> 26:45.054
imagine, an Indian running a shop
in America - had it.

26:45.255 --> 26:47.749
Ah, I mean, she was nothing but a shop.

26:47.950 --> 26:50.836
She couldn't think of anything else but
her shop.

26:51.037 --> 26:55.144
And she knew everything whatever was
in the shop. She knew all the pricing,

26:55.345 --> 26:59.640
she knew everything, her profits,
this thing, that thing.

27:00.340 --> 27:04.279
And when she got Realization she forgot
all about it.

27:04.741 --> 27:10.087
She just forgot and she didn't know where
she had things, you know.

27:10.676 --> 27:12.892
And she was quite worried, she said,
"What has happened to me now?

27:13.093 --> 27:16.475
I am not worried about the shop and I don't
remember where I have put the things

27:16.676 --> 27:19.353
and this things happens and all that..."

27:19.554 --> 27:24.190
But the result was, though she was so much
worried and upset,

27:24.391 --> 27:28.473
that she was making a big profit, much
bigger than it was before.

27:28.674 --> 27:32.580
And she couldn't understand what was
the matter,

27:32.781 --> 27:35.560
how was it she was in such a mess.

27:35.761 --> 27:38.466
And she started telling Me, "Mother,
I can't understand,

27:38.667 --> 27:43.699
this has happened and I was so confused
that I lost all my sense of direction,

27:43.900 --> 27:49.099
of time and everything and I was making
such a lot of profit.

27:49.300 --> 27:51.143
So how is it? What is happening to me?

27:51.344 --> 27:54.964
I mean, I don't understand how do work it
now."

27:55.542 --> 27:59.866
And she was very good at accounts, you see,
but she could not do any accounting.

28:00.067 --> 28:03.791
And ultimately she found that without doing
any accounting,

28:03.992 --> 28:07.556
the money she gathered was quite a lot.

28:08.288 --> 28:12.090
And the things started prospering.
So I said, "Now leave it that way,

28:12.291 --> 28:14.603
why do you want to worry, to get back
to the same position

28:14.804 --> 28:17.917
where you had to write every one dollar,
two dollars?"

28:18.118 --> 28:23.263
Now she says, "I have to write by hundred
dollars, see it's the thing is like that."

28:23.464 --> 28:30.000
Now what happens really when this happens
you go beyond thoughts.

28:30.447 --> 28:34.267
And when you go beyond thoughts, accept
that as a blessing,

28:34.468 --> 28:43.538
accept that as your achievement, accept
that as your resurrection.

28:45.548 --> 28:48.276
Because you go beyond thoughts and with
thoughts you have been doing

28:48.477 --> 28:51.429
all these meticulous things, you see,
your thoughts disappear

28:51.630 --> 28:55.798
and you do not get those information,
and those...

28:55.999 --> 29:01.526
complete efficiency, you see - recording by
which you know you are efficient or not.

29:01.727 --> 29:06.324
Your efficiency to look at goes down, but
on the whole

29:06.525 --> 29:09.258
because you are in thoughtless awareness
the whole dynamism

29:09.459 --> 29:14.422
of God's working starts working for you and
you are amazed at the results

29:14.623 --> 29:18.417
and you are absolutely relaxed.

29:18.766 --> 29:23.209
As if all of them start working for you and
you are just watching the way it is

29:23.410 --> 29:26.609
and wondering what it is.

29:27.672 --> 29:30.407
But unless and until you understand
the importance

29:30.608 --> 29:34.091
of that thoughtless awareness, that point

29:34.292 --> 29:39.526
as - this is the point where I have
to speak - in the same way,

29:40.268 --> 29:43.295
you understand the importance of that
thoughtless awareness,

29:43.496 --> 29:55.286
of your resurrection, of your entering
into the realm of Divine blessings,

29:56.335 --> 29:59.193
you will stick onto your thoughts.

29:59.394 --> 30:03.459
Then you start working out on your thoughts
and there I play

30:03.660 --> 30:09.649
that nothing will work out according to
your thoughts, and will be very obvious.

30:11.476 --> 30:16.004
You'll think of something, plan about
something - it must fail.

30:16.205 --> 30:19.976
If it does not fail, you'll not give up
your thoughts.

30:22.709 --> 30:26.350
And then people again get confused that,
"Mother, I wanted to do this

30:26.551 --> 30:30.172
but I wanted to do this, I believed in it."

30:30.373 --> 30:33.425
So all your beliefs and all your wants

30:33.626 --> 30:38.687
get absolutely neutralized and you are
bewildered.

30:38.888 --> 30:43.447
Because you have to leave all these things
in the hands of God.

30:43.648 --> 30:49.913
He does everything, you do not do anything.
He is almighty.

30:50.114 --> 30:54.007
When there is Almighty to do work for you,
why do you want to do it unnecessarily?

30:54.208 --> 30:59.177
Just to pamper your ego and the ego is also
wrong because you do not do anything.

30:59.378 --> 31:03.882
Just think of it. God only can have ego
because He does everything

31:04.083 --> 31:08.449
while your ego has no meaning, it doesn't
do anything.

31:09.308 --> 31:15.149
And because of these ramblings around,
the way you have made your brain -

31:15.350 --> 31:19.486
you see, every time something comes up
and then another…

31:19.687 --> 31:22.895
"This is not, that is not." Like that you
start verifying everything.

31:23.096 --> 31:25.532
Even people verify "whether I should buy
this or not,

31:25.733 --> 31:27.831
should I buy that, should I do this,"
like that.

31:28.032 --> 31:32.314
They walk, you see, with their vibratory
awareness all the time, using that.

31:32.515 --> 31:36.504
So the truth is born to them, they know
what is truth, what is not.

31:36.705 --> 31:40.183
They can verify through their attention,
their chitta, the truth.

31:40.384 --> 31:45.140
First your chitta gets enlightened, then
in that enlightenment you find the truth.

31:45.341 --> 31:48.732
But the joy is still missing because
of your ramblings.

31:48.933 --> 31:52.896
But to an uncomplicated person, if he gets
his resurrection,

31:53.097 --> 31:57.324
he shoots off, he's not bother about these
ramblings.

31:58.159 --> 32:01.564
Like a little birdie which is born out
of the egg,

32:01.765 --> 32:06.100
starts thinking, "Now, how should I move
my wings?"

32:06.301 --> 32:11.243
So it goes to a library and tries to find.

32:14.045 --> 32:18.998
If not it will consult other little,
little birds,

32:19.199 --> 32:23.272
"Let us sit down and find out how do we
move our wings."

32:23.473 --> 32:29.357
The wings have the power to rise. Allow
them to rise.

32:30.557 --> 32:35.880
And that's what happens, that's why all
these ramblings are there.

32:36.081 --> 32:42.809
So you go to the one side to the truth
finding of everything.

32:43.010 --> 32:47.100
Then the attention is on more on collective
consciousness than on the truth.

32:47.301 --> 32:51.526
So naturally, finding out truth about
others,

32:51.727 --> 32:54.346
you see immediately you say, "Oh, he is
catching this, he's catching that,

32:54.547 --> 32:56.626
that's wrong with that and that's wrong
with that."

32:56.827 --> 33:01.501
But if you are in the stage of joy, which I
am - I don't know much about Sahaj Yoga,

33:01.702 --> 33:05.935
actually I come to know through you
people - I am in complete joy.

33:06.136 --> 33:10.124
And there you see - you find, "Oh ,he's
catching like this, he's like this, some...

33:10.325 --> 33:12.667
this fellow has this problem and that
fellow has that problem

33:12.868 --> 33:17.075
and that must be the reason that is there"
- now they have all become birds.

33:17.276 --> 33:21.659
They are no more eggs now.

33:23.348 --> 33:26.515
Just a little bit of yolk here and there,
you see, it's clinging to their body.

33:26.716 --> 33:29.892
Mother will cleanse them, finished.

33:31.735 --> 33:35.875
But what happens is that we still think
they are still in the egg because they,

33:36.076 --> 33:41.223
they - you see, still go back to the shell,
they're afraid to fly.

33:41.424 --> 33:43.955
So how can it fly, you see, it is
in the shell

33:44.156 --> 33:49.237
and still worried about raising
the wings out, see?

33:49.438 --> 33:54.600
Doesn't want to come out. So the shell has
to fall off fully.

33:54.801 --> 33:58.732
Instead of taking out the shell, you also
enter into your shell thinking,

33:58.933 --> 34:03.601
"Oh God, why is he in the shell? I better
get into my shell as well."

34:05.029 --> 34:08.759
And this happens, with that
the resurrection is delayed.

34:08.967 --> 34:14.757
Resurrection is only complete when you
reach to the state of joy.

34:14.958 --> 34:18.515
But let’s see what happens to a ordinary
villager in India

34:18.716 --> 34:21.818
when I give him Realization. He just
has joy

34:22.019 --> 34:26.864
and he doesn't want to know anything
about it. Knowing is not his job.

34:27.065 --> 34:32.752
He just knows joy. At the most he knows
about the chakras

34:32.953 --> 34:36.796
and how it works and all those things,
I mean, his style is looking from there -

34:36.997 --> 34:40.585
everything he sees everything so clearly,
you see.

34:41.301 --> 34:46.290
We have some very big Sahaj Yogis in India,
you know that, of a very great height.

34:46.491 --> 34:51.754
The other day I received a letter from one
of them, and I was amazed

34:52.542 --> 34:57.483
the way he has - he's expressing himself,
most amazed at it.

34:57.684 --> 35:01.463
He was talking just like Socrates.

35:02.512 --> 35:06.550
There's one fellow who met Me who was just
an ordinary

35:06.751 --> 35:10.240
cart driver, you know these bullock carts
we have,

35:10.441 --> 35:16.691
he was driving Me down in one of these
processions we have there in a village.

35:16.892 --> 35:21.064
And I started talking to him. I was amazed,
he was Kabira -

35:21.265 --> 35:26.690
just like that he was speaking to Me. He
said, "The whole world is open to us now,

35:26.891 --> 35:32.259
the whole universe opens at me and wonders
what a lotus I have become

35:32.460 --> 35:35.184
and my fragrance fills and -" I was amazed
at him,

35:35.385 --> 35:40.799
the poetry he goes on with - a bullock
cart driver.

35:43.460 --> 35:48.830
Because he didn't have any ramblings,
he's there - he's reached there.

35:49.031 --> 35:53.282
And you ask him, "What's the matter
with this fellow, how is he?"

35:53.483 --> 35:56.270
"Oh, he's coming up, he's very well,

35:56.471 --> 35:59.392
he's, he's very well now, much better,
much better."

35:59.593 --> 36:03.553
Never would they tell Me that he's catching
on this chakra or that chakra

36:03.754 --> 36:07.732
and all these details you see: "The schedule
of the whole thing is that...

36:07.933 --> 36:11.420
At 5 o'clock he was catching on his Nabhi.

36:11.621 --> 36:17.902
At 2 past 5 he was catching in his Heart.

36:18.697 --> 36:23.925
At 5 past 2 he was catching on his Agnya

36:24.126 --> 36:27.723
and then suddenly he was catching on his
left Swadhisthana.

36:27.924 --> 36:30.987
So now the answer, what he was he is
suffering from?"

36:31.188 --> 36:34.268
Now you sit down for an examination.

36:34.469 --> 36:38.615
Because giving examination has been
your habit.

36:38.816 --> 36:42.335
So you want to study the whole subject
in a way as if you are appearing

36:42.536 --> 36:47.018
for your MBBS examination. And you want
to write down the whole history

36:47.219 --> 36:49.539
of the patient and come down
to a conclusion,

36:49.740 --> 36:53.274
and conclusion would be all wrong because
by that time

36:53.475 --> 36:59.931
the person would have got Realization
and would be checking your chakras.

37:01.243 --> 37:04.588
This is the topsy turvy of Sahaj Yoga is,

37:04.789 --> 37:08.130
is the most interesting thing the way
it plays with you

37:08.331 --> 37:14.063
and makes you understand that it is not
the way you people go about

37:14.264 --> 37:20.167
losing all your sense of humor, becoming
such serious people,

37:20.368 --> 37:23.885
and getting frustrated and then losing
your tempers.

37:24.086 --> 37:28.802
No, it is joy in which one has to get into.

37:29.145 --> 37:34.095
And that joy you can have if you give up
those ramblings.

37:34.303 --> 37:38.845
Like, some of them wrote a letter to Me
saying that, "Mother, we went through

37:39.046 --> 37:44.605
Gregoire's book, it's very difficult for
us, we just don't follow a word about it."

37:44.806 --> 37:48.737
While they are very great Sahaj Yogis.

37:49.040 --> 37:52.265
He said, "We've given up, You see we knew
English all right but this is

37:52.466 --> 37:56.126
too much for us, it's too much we just
can't get into it, You see?

37:56.341 --> 38:00.765
And part of it was all right when he said
about seeking and when he met You.

38:00.966 --> 38:04.399
After that we don't know what is all that
written there,

38:04.600 --> 38:09.264
we don't understand anything. So next time
when You come,

38:09.465 --> 38:15.042
why not write another book, You see, which
just says what we've found."

38:16.584 --> 38:20.121
So simple as they are, they are all
educated people, not that they are not,

38:20.322 --> 38:24.864
but they do not have this complication.
And these complications as we have

38:25.065 --> 38:31.714
in the West, we should be careful about it.
It's just - I tell you why because

38:31.915 --> 38:37.074
somehow the movement is set in,
in the West,

38:37.275 --> 38:41.507
and in everything we go to extremes,
in everything.

38:41.708 --> 38:44.822
You give them anything, I mean, a simple
thing you give them, you know.

38:45.023 --> 38:47.594
You tell them, "Now, I give you ten
flowers, all right?"

38:47.795 --> 38:51.985
"You gave me ten flowers. All right." Then
I take them to a vase put them there.

38:52.186 --> 38:57.572
No. You give ten flowers to a Western
fellow. He'll write a letter to you,

38:57.773 --> 39:02.040
"Thank you very much for the two daffodils
and one Daisy and one this

39:02.241 --> 39:08.479
and one that" and more. "And I know from
what shop you've got them."

39:08.680 --> 39:15.477
And then they will go in the shop and find
out how much I must have paid.

39:16.726 --> 39:18.967
Then they'll find out, "Now how to repay
it back?"

39:19.168 --> 39:22.971
You see, because you've given them ten
flowers, "Must be one more, eleven at least.

39:23.172 --> 39:27.069
How much will it cost?" So the costing
will be there.

39:27.270 --> 39:30.931
All right, then they will sit down and find
out what are the aesthetics

39:31.131 --> 39:33.927
of particular things are and then "Which
one thinks should we give?

39:34.129 --> 39:36.144
And -" I mean, it's a headache, I tell you.

39:36.345 --> 39:44.264
A simple thing like giving ten flowers,
just. This is going to one extreme.

39:44.465 --> 39:51.238
Now the problem is, with all this going,
with all these happenings,

39:51.526 --> 39:54.804
where are we reduced to?

39:55.791 --> 40:00.761
What are we reduced to? Do you recognize?

40:00.962 --> 40:08.764
Do you see? What is the most important
thing now for us?

40:08.965 --> 40:14.637
Not our economic activity. Is it? No?

40:15.362 --> 40:19.461
Even drinking activity is not important -
of course, that is one of the second most,

40:19.662 --> 40:26.674
I think, or maybe the third most -
or drugging? Nothing is important.

40:27.129 --> 40:32.102
The very rudimentary activity that every
animal knows,

40:32.303 --> 40:37.663
has become the most important activity
for Western mind.

40:37.864 --> 40:43.026
I mean, as if we are reduced to a sex
point.

40:47.267 --> 40:51.154
I mean, it's something madness, I tell you.

40:52.965 --> 40:56.677
I mean, you are resurrected now, you can
see it so clearly

40:56.878 --> 41:00.720
but what about those who cannot see, what
do you say to them?

41:00.921 --> 41:03.969
How do you talk to them?

41:05.748 --> 41:09.174
And this is the biggest problem.

41:09.716 --> 41:13.011
That you do not know where you are
heading for,

41:13.211 --> 41:18.363
where are you, you have lost your moorings,
you see, because of these ramblings.

41:18.564 --> 41:21.527
The moorings are lost.

41:22.307 --> 41:26.890
You cannot find out the depth where
you are.

41:27.667 --> 41:31.881
It's like going all over the places, you
land back in the same place.

41:32.082 --> 41:38.235
Like I'd seen a picture that some people
who got drifted, you see,

41:38.436 --> 41:43.075
in an aeroplane and suddenly got fainted
and all that,

41:43.276 --> 41:47.071
and they thought that they are going
in the other outer space or something

41:47.272 --> 41:55.033
and landing in some new place. And they
landed in a place, suddenly...

41:55.234 --> 42:00.179
and they found it was a very beautiful
place.

42:00.523 --> 42:02.930
There was a river and a beautiful
mountain -

42:03.131 --> 42:06.728
they thought they must have landed in moon
or some planet

42:06.929 --> 42:11.183
which is such a beautiful, plentiful thing,
you see?

42:11.939 --> 42:15.999
And they were very happily settled they
said, "Now we'll settle down here nicely,

42:16.200 --> 42:22.773
make our home, just like Robin Hood and be
very happy people."

42:24.250 --> 42:29.549
And with that idea they slept. And
in the morning, they were awakened

42:29.750 --> 42:33.883
by an English policeman saying, "HEY you,
what are you doing here?"

42:34.084 --> 42:38.959
And they were in England only. They flew
from India -England

42:39.160 --> 42:45.569
and flew back into this place and they did
not know where they were.

42:45.770 --> 42:49.628
In the imaginary world of this sex,

42:50.099 --> 42:54.952
you do not know that you are at the same
rudimentary point,

42:55.153 --> 43:00.631
at the very base of it and you have done
nothing, no advancement of any kind.

43:00.832 --> 43:03.494
Only thing you have created
a hallucination,

43:03.695 --> 43:07.052
a very melodramatic stuff of the whole
thing.

43:07.253 --> 43:12.152
And main basic problem is that.

43:14.522 --> 43:20.797
This is to be pointed out. This is to be
understood.

43:20.998 --> 43:26.486
And once you start understanding
as Sahaj Yogis,

43:26.695 --> 43:33.535
then you will realize how important it is
for you people who are in the West

43:33.743 --> 43:37.766
to take to Sahaj Yoga in a very big way.

43:37.967 --> 43:43.656
And that is the reason also that joy is
kept out of you for the time being.

43:43.857 --> 43:47.034
Because you must know those ramblings
to explain to them.

43:47.235 --> 43:51.498
Because supposing you meet an Western
philosopher, intellectual,

43:51.699 --> 43:55.041
I meet many of them, headaches I tell you,

43:55.242 --> 43:57.980
because I'm not so good at these things,
you know.

43:58.181 --> 44:06.157
And they just start, "Did you read Mr...
Madcap?" I said, "Who is that?"

44:06.358 --> 44:11.753
"Oh, he's PhD in that, M.A.D. in that."
"I didn't read him."

44:11.954 --> 44:14.377
"Oh, he says..." "All right."

44:14.578 --> 44:19.045
You have to read the whole library to talk
to any one of them, you see.

44:19.245 --> 44:26.431
And then they will say that, "You see, your
this-thing doesn't befit our culture, no."

44:26.633 --> 44:32.611
Imagine, is that the culture of English
or of Western people?

44:34.526 --> 44:40.874
The modern intellectuals, you see -
what are they?

44:41.075 --> 44:47.713
The same rudimentary thing, that's all.
Nothing more than that.

44:49.445 --> 44:53.458
They are telling you to retain your ego,
just to do that.

44:53.659 --> 44:59.652
Everything ending up there. And here you
have to confront such fools

44:59.853 --> 45:04.768
so is better that you know all analysis
to talk to them.

45:05.515 --> 45:08.050
They don't want to hear about God, they
don't want to hear about Christ,

45:08.251 --> 45:11.712
they don't want to hear about anybody else
but a man

45:11.913 --> 45:17.199
who tells them to become just that.

45:21.668 --> 45:26.805
They are devaluation you can call it,
not evolution.

45:28.633 --> 45:36.791
They're degradation, such a person is
accepted today and regarded as God.

45:38.501 --> 45:43.267
So it is for Sahaj Yogis to understand
and recognize

45:43.468 --> 45:48.741
the importance of their being Western
people.

45:48.941 --> 45:54.493
How powerful they should be and how much
willpower they should have

45:54.731 --> 46:01.962
to fight this, because this is the turning
point.

46:04.670 --> 46:10.532
And for Me also this is the turning point.
You all have been...

46:10.733 --> 46:14.055
all Sahaja Yogis, there's nobody - ah have
you come before, isn't it?

46:14.256 --> 46:18.113
[Person in audience says:] No, I'm new.
Shri Mataji: Is it? I'm sorry.

46:18.314 --> 46:22.977
Can you, you give her her Realization today
because today I,

46:23.202 --> 46:28.037
as usual, the time doesn't sit for Me and
I don't sit for time.

46:28.238 --> 46:32.684
I have to go for something, which you
understand.

46:34.123 --> 46:38.232
You are all invited in My house for dinner

46:38.433 --> 46:41.608
and everything is cooked there for you,
those who want to go.

46:41.809 --> 46:46.211
Because I invited some they came
in the morning... for lunch

46:46.412 --> 46:50.330
but I couldn't tell all of them.
But I am going out, though I'm there.

46:50.531 --> 46:54.089
Those who can go and would like to have
something to eat can go to My house.

46:54.290 --> 47:01.112
There's, I hope, it's sufficient. If not,
I hope, somebody will look after that side.

47:01.313 --> 47:03.735
[There are pickles and lot of stuff
in the house,

47:03.943 --> 47:08.414
take it out and make some food out of it.]
Those who want to go to My house are welcome

47:08.615 --> 47:14.880
and can taste the food that I prepared,
and enjoy yourself.

47:16.421 --> 47:21.278
I'm sorry today, you see, I have to go but
you'll get Realization, no problem.

47:21.479 --> 47:26.544
Did you get cool breeze in the hand?
Nothing? Sure?

47:26.745 --> 47:29.374
Now just see that. Again the business
of flying.

47:29.575 --> 47:32.060
Just see now, are you getting cool breeze
or not. [New lady:] Here and here.

47:32.268 --> 47:37.573
Shri Mataji: Then it's all right, done. Now
you fly. Fly out fast. Immediately.

47:37.788 --> 47:41.190
Fly out fast. If you settle down again back
into the hole

47:41.391 --> 47:46.255
then it will be difficult, all right?
She's got it.

47:46.456 --> 47:50.801
This was nice, give her some papers.
I didn't know you were new, you see,

47:51.002 --> 47:54.454
but still it's all right, doesn't matter.

47:54.619 --> 47:57.009
These things were meant for Sahaj Yogis,
you see,

47:57.193 --> 48:02.266
because they are really great people here,
all very knowledgeable.

48:04.252 --> 48:06.622
Actually I have to learn from you many
things.

48:06.823 --> 48:10.007
I don't know so many things, I tell you,

48:10.208 --> 48:15.423
and it was such a knowledge, I tell you,
I read too much of it.

48:15.624 --> 48:20.835
So thank you very much and somebody has
to guide them.

48:21.036 --> 48:25.547
[Chaya, take these people to home, there
might not be sufficient food

48:25.748 --> 48:27.771
for so many of these, but you can make
rice.

48:27.972 --> 48:32.778
And the other cook will also do something.
Anyway there is lot of food in the house.

48:32.994 --> 48:40.273
Today give food to everyone.] Those who can
go, would like to go, can go. All right?

48:41.344 --> 48:44.667
What's it?
[Yogini:] Your coat.

48:44.900 --> 48:48.420
Shri Mataji: I have learnt some things
in England, is to wear a coat.

48:48.621 --> 48:52.161
In the same wa, you have to learn som
things.

48:56.130 --> 49:01.238
May God bless you... Oh, thank you
very much.

49:03.882 --> 49:07.115
The reason is the... (unclear).

49:07.316 --> 49:09.928
All kinds of (VISAS?) you are getting since
I have come here.

49:10.129 --> 49:12.868
Only you used to have (WHITE?), soon
and all that, do you remember?

49:13.069 --> 49:15.553
Do you remember that (unclear: PICTURE
THAT) he could never seek

49:15.754 --> 49:19.805
a (unclear: QUEEN TAPEMENT?). Before
I had recognised you.

49:20.006 --> 49:21.805
Beautiful.

49:22.999 --> 49:27.817
Thank you. Shri Ganesh again.
Just to compare.

49:28.377 --> 49:31.654
Now what did you give?

49:46.366 --> 49:52.924
It’s the sari which you gave Me if you
remember, for Puja.

50:15.788 --> 50:19.269
Thank you. Have you found out the address?

50:19.470 --> 50:20.877
Yogi: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Did he telephone?

50:21.078 --> 50:22.625
Yogi: No well he's been... can't find out
the telephone number, Mother.

50:22.826 --> 50:25.255
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon? Yogi: He
can't find out the telephone number.

50:25.456 --> 50:27.289
It's not in the book and the High
Commission gave the wrong number.

50:27.490 --> 50:33.737
Shri Mataji: Alright. So, we’ll take
about fifteen minutes.

50:43.267 --> 50:45.751
It’s beautiful.

50:51.450 --> 50:53.343
So, shall we go now?

50:53.544 --> 50:56.617
Thank you! Thank you very much.

50:56.818 --> 50:58.525
Yogini: How is Wilma?

50:58.726 --> 51:01.909
Shri Mataji: Hello, how are you now?
Better? You are looking much better now,

51:02.110 --> 51:06.786
much better, eh? Looking so much younger,
see? [Lady unclearly:].

51:07.284 --> 51:10.943
Shri Mataji: Now don't be frightened of Me,
all right? It’s going to work out.

51:11.144 --> 51:13.685
Now. Alright.

51:13.886 --> 51:16.800
Take a big one, Jeff? What do you call
that?

51:17.001 --> 51:21.771
Yogini: Nutties.
Shri Mataji: Hmm. We call it Nuggets.

51:27.955 --> 51:30.693
You can take them to My house.

51:32.070 --> 51:35.398
Our drawing room is lying very much
in an upset condition.

51:35.599 --> 51:38.366
I hope you don't mind seeing.

51:43.799 --> 51:48.203
All right, Bye. May God bless you.
[Yogis:] Bye bye.

51:48.429 --> 51:52.532
(...)
