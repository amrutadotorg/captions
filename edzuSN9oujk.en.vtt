00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:13.059
This place, Nasik, has a special significance,
that long time back, say about eight thousands

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:26.359
years back, when Shri Rama went away for His
exile, He came to Maharashtra and He passed

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:39.700
through various places and He settled down
in Nasik, this place, with His wife.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:54.149
And here a lady who was actually the wife,
was the sister of Ravana, called Shurpanakha,

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:04.780
she tried to entice Shri Rama.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:20.250
Now this quality of enticing men or enticing
women are really demonic and that is how people

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.290
call them rakshasas.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:37.060
Because those who are demonic people are people
who are by nature aggressive, full of ego,

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.770
who want to overpower everyone.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.670
And they feel quite satisfied if their ego
is satisfied.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:57.530
So all the people who were like that, were
called as rakshasas in this country.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:05.950
Was not a normal human behavior, according
to them.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:23.440
So these rakshasas were more living in the
northern part, northern most part of India

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.420
and they have different categories like described.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.390
So those who run after women were called by
some other name and where the women tried

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.000
to dominate them are called by some other
name.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.810
Where the men tried to become like women,
there is another name.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.780
But they were never called as human beings.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:56.840
They were called as “Rakshasas” or “Betalas”
and all other names.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:05.900
But now-a-days you find such a confusion that
you don’t know whom to call what.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:16.460
But the human beings in those days were sensible,
matured, deep, who with the age matured.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:25.470
Now you have to notice on the streets of Maharashtra,
just now I was coming by train, I saw, no

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.920
men, there were nobody who were interested
in women, no women were interested in men,

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.260
some men were hugging each other, walking
around, holding innocently.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:47.590
I mean, the whole thing was, that life is
innocence.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.790
And that is what it was here when this rakshasa’s
sister, Shurpanakha.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.630
So nowadays, if there is a woman in India
who behaves like that, tries to entice men

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.510
is called Shurpanakha.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.290
So this woman came and tried to entice Shri
Rama.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.620
Imagine what audacity.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:17.600
So, Shri Rama being sankochit, he was a man
full of grace, He told her, “See now, what’s

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.060
the use of running after Me?

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.650
I’ve already got a beautiful wife.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.490
So why do you run after Me?

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:34.150
Better try My brother who has no wife.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:47.320
” Because He knew that His brother is a
Sheshnaga, he is the serpent on which, very

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.310
big serpent called Shesha, Shesha.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:58.780
And he is a hot tempered fellow and he will
just know how to deal with this woman and

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.530
“I can’t manage this show.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.330
” Because He would not ill-treat a woman,
it was too much for Him.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:12.220
Though she was Shurpanakha, and not only that,
but she was also a woman.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:24.780
So when He went, no, He asked her that, “You
go and see him.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.090
” Lakshmana was sitting outside.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:39.169
Lakshmana had taken a vow to be a brahmachari,
a celibate man, with fourteen years penance,

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.740
though he was a married man.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:49.600
This he had to do and that’s the only way
he could kill another demon, whose name was

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:56.840
Meghnad, who had run away with his daughter,
called as Sulochana.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.560
It’s a long story.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:08.639
So, make it short, this fellow went to this
brahmachari, Lakshmana, thou he had a wife

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:13.080
in Ayodhya, was leading a life of brahmachari.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.840
It is very common in India.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:23.490
I mean, if your wife is away, you just think
about her, and you are in separation, still

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.890
you enjoy your wife thinking about her.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.180
You think about the good things she has done
to you.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.570
But if she has done all the time bad things,
you don’t want too think about her.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.070
And then all these demonic things start.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.320
All right.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.710
So this, when she went and started.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:48.520
She dressed up very well, in a very attractive
manner, tried to show off her body and all

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:55.890
that, in a very funny way, and not in the
traditional, decent way, but a very indecent,

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.680
indecorous manner, just to attract.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:06.570
He was so angry with her, He just cut her
nose.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:14.700
So she should not do this to anybody else
and get rid of her pride of nonsense, to kill

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.220
her ego.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:24.360
Because nose is the one that expresses actually
the ego part.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:33.680
So when he cut his nose, the nose is called
as nasika, in Sanskrit, is called as nasika.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:41.360
This was the place where the nose was cut
and that’s why this place was called as

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.650
Nasik.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:08:01.690
So now we have to remember we have come to
an area where noses can be cut.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:16.370
So one has to be careful
and on the watch out that we do not show any,

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:21.930
any symptom that Shurpanakha did, hence forth.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:29.810
We should behave in a manner that we are Sahaja
Yogis and Sahaja Yoginis.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:44.800
And we have to have that right type of conduct
which comes from the purity inside.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:55.940
So, as this is now actually the beginning
of the tour in the real sense of the word,

00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:07.550
I have to make certain suggestions to all
of you, that our behavior should be very decent

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:20.300
and decorous so that all the vibrations that
are flowing through us, which are holy vibrations,

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:30.759
auspicious vibrations, should not be spoiled
by our ego or our Shurpanakha ideas, or any

00:09:30.759 --> 00:09:37.160
such nonsense which has no relevance to your
ascent.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:43.389
All these come from decadence, the decadence
we have gone through.

00:09:43.389 --> 00:09:47.209
And because you have come up you can see the
decadence of the society.

00:09:47.209 --> 00:09:57.879
So here you have to show through your good
behavior, good dress and good conduct, the

00:09:57.879 --> 00:10:05.239
beauty that you have developed within yourself
and that now you belong to a society which

00:10:05.239 --> 00:10:09.579
has ascent and the decadence is over now.

00:10:09.579 --> 00:10:21.740
It is only for you to watch that and to help
others to come out of it.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:28.009
Beginning of the tour at Nasik is a very holy
and auspicious thing that has happened to

00:10:28.009 --> 00:10:30.380
all of you.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:38.259
Because the river here Godhavari is called
as the Ganges of the south.

00:10:38.259 --> 00:10:50.649
But as in every pure thing all the filth is
put in, this great kshetra, the pilgrimage,

00:10:50.649 --> 00:10:57.769
is ruined by many people who want to exploit.

00:10:57.769 --> 00:10:59.489
We call them as “vadjees”.

00:10:59.489 --> 00:11:06.009
They are the ones who are making money out
of the temples, out of the holiness of this

00:11:06.009 --> 00:11:07.449
place.

00:11:07.449 --> 00:11:14.230
To them Sahaja Yoga is a challenge because
you can do it without any money, without any

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:22.220
work, without any extra sacrifices.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.829
That they can’t understand.

00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:32.080
According to the theory of all these people,
all over the world, if you see, is this, that

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:38.010
all those who are seeking should hand over
the purse to the people who are in charge,

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:39.369
first of all.

00:11:39.369 --> 00:11:44.529
Secondly, those who are seeking should become
absolutely miserable in their seeking.

00:11:44.529 --> 00:11:47.510
They should suffer, suffer and suffer.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:51.879
Till they become just bones and die.

00:11:51.879 --> 00:11:59.019
They have to go on sacrificing everything,
going through tortures till they reach God.

00:11:59.019 --> 00:12:05.019
This is not the way the ascent has to be achieved,
as you have learned it.

00:12:05.019 --> 00:12:16.059
This is true not only of Hindus, also of Jains,
also of Christianity, also of Islam.

00:12:16.059 --> 00:12:21.860
The way it is preached today is all adharma,
there is no dharma in it.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:29.959
That’s why the establishment of our dharma
is very important, which is the pure religion

00:12:29.959 --> 00:12:39.839
which gives you ascent, joy, peace and the
blessings of God.

00:12:39.839 --> 00:12:47.440
This is what is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:53.720
Now I have to also say that this place has
another significance that we have a very powerful

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:59.809
Jain, a gentleman who has come to this dharma.

00:12:59.809 --> 00:13:06.699
Now, Jainism again the same style it’s going,
same perversions as we have seen.

00:13:06.699 --> 00:13:12.230
Like about Jains if I’m going tell you,
you will laugh and laugh, and laugh and just

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:13.230
won’t stop.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:15.339
So I don’t want to go about it.

00:13:15.339 --> 00:13:19.269
Again, the Jains are mad about vegetarianism.

00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:24.559
They want to save all the mosquitoes, bugs,
everything and kill the human beings, all

00:13:24.559 --> 00:13:26.230
right, with money.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:31.639
They are the Jews of our country and they
have really extracted people, their money

00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:32.639
and everything.

00:13:32.639 --> 00:13:39.980
Very rich people here but they don’t kill
a mosquito or kill a bug.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:42.019
That’s what they are.

00:13:42.019 --> 00:13:50.910
So now this kind of thing is on and doctor
Sanghvi, who is a very learned man, his wife

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:58.110
is another very affectionate and dedicated
Sahaja Yogini, the son, daughter in law, all

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:05.370
of them have understood that religion cannot
be such madness that you start saving the

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:07.079
mosquitoes and not the human beings.

00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:14.230
The attention is from the other end, which,
of course, against Mahavira’s principle.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:17.819
Mahavira on the contrary had described the
hell the best.

00:14:17.819 --> 00:14:27.230
He is the one who being the Incarnation of
the essence of Bhairava and described the

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:28.299
hell very well.

00:14:28.299 --> 00:14:33.850
And in England we have William Blake, who
has also done the same way because he is the

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:38.009
same style, he is the same thing.

00:14:38.009 --> 00:14:42.549
What is hell that he described, there are
worms, there are mosquitoes, this, that.

00:14:42.549 --> 00:14:48.230
And just the opposite of that is to save the
mosquitoes and bugs, shows how we go just

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:56.970
the other way round, how we oppose the religious
achievements of these great people, those

00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:02.730
who tried to teach something sensible, how
they make a nonsense out of it.

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:16.949
That is how, here we see that the Jains should
see how Shri Mahavira is being misinterpreted

00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:19.949
and insulted in many ways.

00:15:19.949 --> 00:15:26.059
This is a very big achievement I feel that
some people have started seeing this light

00:15:26.059 --> 00:15:29.879
and they will start seeing it more and more.

00:15:29.879 --> 00:15:40.730
Also we have some very good here musicians,
as you have heard him and it’s a whole party

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:46.800
was so beautiful, I heard about him, that
he sang beautiful songs for you and you enjoyed

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.420
all the music program.

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:53.160
And he also sang some very nice English songs.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.389
It’s a good beginning.

00:15:55.389 --> 00:16:02.519
Because as you are singing Marathi songs and
Hindi songs, our Indians also should sing.

00:16:02.519 --> 00:16:07.359
But they make a melody out of everything.

00:16:07.359 --> 00:16:13.499
So you have to little bit guide them, because
they are, you see, they are melody oriented

00:16:13.499 --> 00:16:15.499
musicians.

00:16:15.499 --> 00:16:21.549
So we try to make melody out of everything,
otherwise it doesn’t go with our minds all

00:16:21.549 --> 00:16:22.549
right.

00:16:22.549 --> 00:16:26.029
So you have to give some guidance and you
have to forgive them if you think it is not

00:16:26.029 --> 00:16:32.759
absolutely all right.

00:16:32.759 --> 00:16:40.609
So we have to thank all the people over here
for being so kind and so nice to us, and the

00:16:40.609 --> 00:16:41.609
singing.

00:16:41.609 --> 00:16:44.869
And I hope you are all very comfortable in
that place.

00:16:44.869 --> 00:16:52.690
The only problem was we couldn’t get a proper
place, as doctor Sanghvi was worried.

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:55.459
Because, you see, Indians are too much hospitable.

00:16:55.459 --> 00:17:00.329
And he said, “I’ll have to cover all the
sides, I don’t want them to get the cold,

00:17:00.329 --> 00:17:01.329
this, that.

00:17:01.329 --> 00:17:03.329
I’ll put some heaters there.

00:17:03.329 --> 00:17:10.740
” But by God’s grace, there’s no need.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:12.230
And so pleasant.

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:16.490
I was just smiling at him, I said, “don’t
you worry, everything will work out.

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:21.210
” And it has worked out, you know, we don’t
need any heaters, and if we need anything,

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:25.690
we might need some fans.

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:31.030
Like in Madras they said, “We have no water,
we have to buy water now from other places

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:33.710
going to be, we are all going to be dying.

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:38.790
” I said, “All right, you’ll have water.

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:46.080
” So it rained, rained, rained so much that
they had floods.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:55.960
So it should not be felt that there is a problem
with the nature.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:59.420
Nature is always with you, will always help
you, will be kind.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:03.760
But we have to be kind to ourselves, to our
nature.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:08.490
The nature that we have is that we are human
beings, we are not rakshasas, we are not devils,

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:18.420
we can’t do all these things which are devilish,
which are nonsensical.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:29.450
And once we understand that we are saints,
we will know that we have to keep our saintly

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:37.310
hood in such a manner that others can see
through our behavior.

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:46.620
Nasik has another great heritage that many
saints came and did tapasyas, tapoguni.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:56.690
Nasik area is the tapoguni, is the land of
tapas, tapasyas and that’s why this is a

00:18:56.690 --> 00:19:00.310
very, very auspicious land.

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:02.290
And here it is.

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:22.070
You will see on your way to Dhulia, the Incarnation
of the Adi Shakti, which is the three powers

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:49.480
of the Kundalini completely integrated, expressed
here as Sapta Shringi, meaning seven peaks.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:55.120
Now seven peaks are the seven centers in the
brain.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:05.230
And the Kundalini, though she has seven centers
to pass through, the governing pithas, the

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:17.020
seats, are in the peak, in the head and so
Adi Shakti takes place in the Sahastrara.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.290
She incarnates in the Sahastrara.

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:27.620
So we can say that this is the Sahastrara
of Maharashtra, or of the Universe in a way,

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:36.580
though Himalaya is regarded as the real abode
of Sadashiva, which is on top.

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:44.090
But the Sahastrara part, which is the limbic
area, should be here because we have three

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:47.050
and a half coils settled here.

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:51.200
That’s why the Kundalini of the Universe
is here.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:21:01.960
But as the Sapta Shringi has come out of Mother
Earth, this is the place where we can say

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.300
resides the Sahastrara.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:13.890
Though the, on top is the Himalaya, and Himalaya
we can say is beyond Sahastrara, the three

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:20.850
powers of the Goddess I don’t know if you’ll
be seeing all these, three expressed in three

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:27.270
different places in the Maharashtra, but this
is the Ardha Matra, the half Matra, which

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:30.430
is the Adi Shakti Herself.

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:39.110
And this is what you see in this place and
I’m sure you’ll enjoy it tomorrow when

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:42.290
you go on your way to Dhulia.

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:52.280
With this understanding that in a subtle way
we are in a very important place, I hope you

00:21:52.280 --> 00:22:12.960
all will raise above mundane gross attention
into a subtler attention, into a higher attention and enjoy  the bliss of God.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.380
May God bless you.
