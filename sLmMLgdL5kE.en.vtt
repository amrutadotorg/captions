00:00:00.198 --> 00:00:03.579
Birthday Puja March 21, 1998
Delhi, India

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:12.634
I was overjoyed to see

00:00:12.715 --> 00:00:20.633
the way you had organized this beautiful welcome.

00:00:24.163 --> 00:00:30.743
I must say that it’s your love which finds

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:41.568
all kind of expressions of enjoying Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:51.788
I really can’t understand how these unique ideas

00:00:52.114 --> 00:01:00.137
come to your heads, and you represent

00:01:00.174 --> 00:01:05.877
the different countries from where you have come.

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:14.975
I wish you carry these flags back to
your own countries,

00:01:15.205 --> 00:01:20.161
and tell them the message that the time has come

00:01:20.454 --> 00:01:26.978
for our resurrection, that we have to rise.

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:33.045
We have to rise above this human level

00:01:33.307 --> 00:01:36.870
to a higher level of existence.

00:01:37.037 --> 00:01:42.825
And if that happens, then how it changes your life,

00:01:43.246 --> 00:01:51.526
how it makes you happy,
how you lose all your absurd ideas of hatred

00:01:51.773 --> 00:02:04.880
and of harming others, injuring others: all this kind of ideas

00:02:05.157 --> 00:02:13.044
which have worked out to give some sort of
a sadistic pleasure to many people,

00:02:13.115 --> 00:02:22.373
and they have enjoyed the way they want to destroy

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.270
the joy of others, the happiness of others.

00:02:28.213 --> 00:02:35.059
To maintain the happiness, I know, you being Sahaja Yogis,

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:41.846
you have to bear a lot, tolerate a lot of nonsense.

00:02:41.904 --> 00:02:47.908
You have already done it, and gradually once

00:02:48.027 --> 00:02:54.334
Sahaja Yoga is established in your own countries as something

00:02:54.794 --> 00:02:59.587
that is so beautiful, so very pure,

00:02:59.723 --> 00:03:05.273
so very important that all others in your countries

00:03:05.298 --> 00:03:13.854
also will try to follow that path which you have crossed over.

00:03:14.198 --> 00:03:18.799
Only your lives are the ones which will reflect

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:25.048
the beauty of your inner being and of Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:26.924 --> 00:03:32.501
I told you yesterday what was missing in the human awareness,

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.835
and that the attention was not on the Spirit.

00:03:37.964 --> 00:03:43.997
But when it is on the Spirit, what happens to you?

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:52.133
Firstly you become according to Sanskrit words, gunatit:

00:03:53.207 --> 00:03:56.816
you go beyond all the three gunas.

00:03:57.123 --> 00:04:06.175
That means you are no more a person who is tamo guni,

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:17.357
means the one who has got all kinds of desires of self-indulgence.

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.099
Your attention moves from there to the second style

00:04:24.186 --> 00:04:28.475
where you are rajo guni, the right-sidedness:

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.408
they want to do something, want to show something,

00:04:31.448 --> 00:04:35.986
you want to become something, you want to compete with others.

00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:38.954
All this struggle just disappears.

00:04:39.296 --> 00:04:42.114
"Atit" means beyond.

00:04:42.296 --> 00:04:48.050
Then sattwa guni: that is also where you are seeking,

00:04:48.257 --> 00:04:53.736
where you see that what’s wrong in this kind of extreme behavior,

00:04:53.863 --> 00:04:57.568
and you just hate that kind of life

00:04:57.593 --> 00:05:03.123
and you want to get out of it, and then you start seeking.

00:05:03.688 --> 00:05:05.959
That also is finished.

00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:12.987
All the gunas are finished, so you become gunatit.

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:20.172
It just happens when your attention goes to your Spirit,

00:05:20.427 --> 00:05:27.660
because now the attention is not on any one of your inherent,

00:05:27.685 --> 00:05:33.873
you can say, or conditioned qualities, or of egoistical qualities.

00:05:34.864 --> 00:05:41.702
So you become a person who is beyond this.

00:05:43.367 --> 00:05:49.584
This is something very remarkable as far as

00:05:49.609 --> 00:05:54.273
for normal life, but for you it is not, it just happens.

00:05:54.393 --> 00:05:57.044
You just enjoy being yourself.

00:05:57.481 --> 00:06:03.613
You’re no more concerned about your own conveniences,
comforts and petty things.

00:06:03.679 --> 00:06:08.281
But what happens is that you just go beyond

00:06:08.384 --> 00:06:12.043
all these three gunas which have been

00:06:12.211 --> 00:06:17.707
dominating you this way or that way.

00:06:21.022 --> 00:06:27.831
So that’s how you cross the limit of human awareness, firstly.

00:06:28.765 --> 00:06:38.792
Then the second one is, you become kalatit: you go beyond time.

00:06:39.131 --> 00:06:43.171
I know today I was late somehow.

00:06:43.577 --> 00:06:45.863
It just works out that way.

00:06:45.888 --> 00:06:48.186
But you didn’t miss the time.

00:06:48.211 --> 00:06:51.966
You were still enjoying.
I could see, sitting in the house,

00:06:52.093 --> 00:06:54.837
that you are all in a very enjoyable mood,

00:06:54.862 --> 00:06:57.875
all of you are enjoying nicely.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.795
I’m not here, but still you are enjoying.

00:07:02.008 --> 00:07:04.318
This is beyond time.

00:07:04.343 --> 00:07:06.689
You’re not bound by time.

00:07:06.714 --> 00:07:10.663
Whatever is the time is your own, because

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.393
you are standing in the present,

00:07:13.816 --> 00:07:19.024
you are not standing here and thinking of the future.

00:07:19.335 --> 00:07:22.683
You didn’t think about what will happen tomorrow

00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:26.660
or how will you catch your plane, or how will you do this.

00:07:26.685 --> 00:07:28.929
Here you were just enjoying,

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:33.826
enjoying the present, and the present is the reality.

00:07:34.445 --> 00:07:38.755
If you are thinking of the future or of the past,

00:07:38.842 --> 00:07:42.009
then you are not in reality.
I have told many-a-times

00:07:42.223 --> 00:07:45.333
that past is finished and future doesn’t exist.

00:07:45.358 --> 00:07:49.362
So at this moment you are here sitting,

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:53.331
perhaps may be waiting for Me, may be

00:07:53.394 --> 00:07:57.688
just enjoying every moment of your stay here,

00:07:57.792 --> 00:08:00.990
of your connections with others.

00:08:01.435 --> 00:08:05.014
And this enjoyment cannot be described,

00:08:05.094 --> 00:08:08.172
how you are enjoying this.

00:08:09.093 --> 00:08:12.149
Otherwise people would be seeing the watch,

00:08:12.221 --> 00:08:14.871
wondering, “Why Mother has not come?

00:08:14.905 --> 00:08:16.736
What is the problem?

00:08:16.761 --> 00:08:23.213
Why She is not arrived?” and all kinds of ideas can go round.

00:08:23.578 --> 00:08:27.099
It helps a lot to be kalatit.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.976
I remember in Nasik I had to work very hard because

00:08:32.001 --> 00:08:35.229
no Sahaja Yogi would come forward to do anything,

00:08:35.254 --> 00:08:38.615
they were so shy and so much worried.

00:08:39.406 --> 00:08:43.388
And it so happened, luckily or unluckily we can say,

00:08:43.508 --> 00:08:46.150
that My car failed on the way and

00:08:46.217 --> 00:08:49.989
I was delayed in going.

00:08:50.225 --> 00:08:57.926
About one hour passed, there was no car coming that way,
there’s no way to go,

00:08:58.196 --> 00:09:01.151
and we were stranded on the road.

00:09:01.247 --> 00:09:05.172
Now surprisingly, when I reached the place

00:09:05.203 --> 00:09:11.091
where we were going to have the program,
the Sahaja Yogis took over.

00:09:11.261 --> 00:09:16.279
They took the responsibility, and they were very busy

00:09:16.914 --> 00:09:20.273
giving Realizations to others and working it out.

00:09:20.298 --> 00:09:22.170
Otherwise they would not.

00:09:22.195 --> 00:09:25.555
They could not believe that they have power to give Realization.

00:09:25.666 --> 00:09:29.147
I may tell them, but they would not raise their hands.

00:09:29.176 --> 00:09:35.543
And just because the time was there
and they thought, “So many people are here,

00:09:35.568 --> 00:09:41.239
Mother is not coming or She may be coming,
so it’s our responsibility.”

00:09:41.393 --> 00:09:44.803
In that way they took the responsibility.

00:09:44.851 --> 00:09:50.261
So when you are beyond the time,
you become responsible for that moment.

00:09:51.296 --> 00:09:55.765
It’s such a responsibility which is also collective,

00:09:56.122 --> 00:10:01.014
means you just all of you become responsible.

00:10:02.712 --> 00:10:06.086
It’s very surprising, we are so many here,

00:10:06.126 --> 00:10:09.549
there’s no quarrel, no fight, nothing.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:14.436
We are very nicely settled down, just beyond

00:10:14.461 --> 00:10:19.666
all kinds of stupid ideas of attacking each other.

00:10:19.825 --> 00:10:26.964
That happens because you are not involved with the time.

00:10:27.115 --> 00:10:29.588
The time cannot bow you down.

00:10:29.728 --> 00:10:33.591
Perhaps if it were not you people, some other people,

00:10:33.702 --> 00:10:37.026
they would have thrown stones on My car,

00:10:37.051 --> 00:10:42.788
thinking,  “So it is so late She comes,
we are here boiling in the heat.”

00:10:42.903 --> 00:10:45.213
They would have resented.

00:10:45.238 --> 00:10:48.637
But not the people who are beyond time.

00:10:48.915 --> 00:10:51.886
They are nicely sitting down, enjoying themselves.

00:10:52.157 --> 00:10:57.607
It doesn’t matter, the time passes on.

00:10:59.098 --> 00:11:05.384
Then you become dharmatit: you become beyond dharma,

00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:13.416
beyond your human nature.

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:18.832
That means whatever you do is religious,

00:11:21.023 --> 00:11:25.591
whatever is your endeavor is religious.

00:11:27.036 --> 00:11:30.353
If, say, you are in a business,

00:11:30.591 --> 00:11:34.614
you would like to do business in a religious manner,

00:11:34.717 --> 00:11:39.624
because you are beyond religion you are not bothered as to

00:11:39.664 --> 00:11:44.076
follow a particular pattern or ritual of any religion,

00:11:44.458 --> 00:11:46.695
but you are beyond it.

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:55.590
Like people who are, you see, not beyond religion:

00:11:56.058 --> 00:12:00.588
they must get up early in the morning,  they are bound

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:05.777
by their rituals and they pass through the rituals,

00:12:05.802 --> 00:12:10.625
and if one of the rituals is not done
they are very unhappy and shaken up.

00:12:10.767 --> 00:12:12.287
But not you.

00:12:12.391 --> 00:12:15.511
For you, you are always in dhyan,

00:12:15.575 --> 00:12:20.138
always in meditative mood, and anything goes wrong

00:12:20.339 --> 00:12:23.365
you just jump into that awareness

00:12:23.445 --> 00:12:27.733
where you get the solution, and you are not disturbed,

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:33.160
not disturbed at all when things go wrong.

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:38.916
Like ritualistic nature makes you very constricted,

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:43.296
very docile, sometimes can be aggressive also.

00:12:43.559 --> 00:12:47.802
People with their ritualism trouble others a lot.

00:12:48.028 --> 00:12:53.507
Like one lady who was supposed to be our friend came to My house.

00:12:53.797 --> 00:12:56.930
So she said, "I’m a vegetarian."
I said, "Then?"

00:12:57.009 --> 00:13:03.389
"But I can’t eat the food in which non–veg. food has been cooked."

00:13:04.101 --> 00:13:05.270
"All right.

00:13:05.295 --> 00:13:08.466
So we’ll have to get new utensils."

00:13:08.491 --> 00:13:11.440
So I went and bought new utensils for her.

00:13:11.473 --> 00:13:14.397
So she said that "You have to be careful

00:13:14.477 --> 00:13:19.278
that even the spoon should not be used."

00:13:19.373 --> 00:13:22.435
So I had to go and get for her a spoon.

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:28.917
Then she said, "Tumblers; because people are taking food here

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:32.095
who are eating non–veg. food,

00:13:32.197 --> 00:13:37.672
so you better get us something which is absolutely new."

00:13:37.856 --> 00:13:40.724
So I had to incur all these problems.

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:44.634
And then she was in the kitchen and she wouldn’t allow

00:13:44.712 --> 00:13:46.841
our cook to cook anything for us.

00:13:46.896 --> 00:13:50.232
She said, "First I will cook, and then you can cook."

00:13:50.335 --> 00:13:53.477
And she made such a nuisance out of her

00:13:53.548 --> 00:13:57.683
that instead of being a guest she became a pest,

00:13:58.203 --> 00:14:01.907
and this is what happens to people who are ritualistic,

00:14:01.954 --> 00:14:04.439
because they are very demanding.

00:14:04.463 --> 00:14:08.189
They go on demanding that “This is our dharma.”

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:14.253
I know of another story was told to Me by somebody in Bombay.

00:14:14.385 --> 00:14:18.187
She said, "This lady who came to me as a guest, because

00:14:18.266 --> 00:14:21.615
she was related to something very high up,

00:14:21.854 --> 00:14:26.287
she was worse than my great-great-great-grandmother."

00:14:26.382 --> 00:14:28.122
I said, "Really?"

00:14:28.147 --> 00:14:31.748
She said, "I can’t understand that in India

00:14:31.803 --> 00:14:34.295
we have such people still living.

00:14:34.327 --> 00:14:39.388
She came here and she said, ‘I cannot take water from the tap.

00:14:39.583 --> 00:14:43.343
You have to get it from some sort of a well.’

00:14:43.639 --> 00:14:47.130
“Now, there are only two wells in Bombay.

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:50.699
So people had to go and fetch the water,

00:14:50.774 --> 00:14:55.464
but the cook had to be completely drenched in water

00:14:55.489 --> 00:14:57.846
and then only he could cook.

00:14:57.871 --> 00:15:01.280
“‘Because if he cooks without that, then I won’t eat.’

00:15:01.725 --> 00:15:05.791
“And she went on, and on, and on there, and

00:15:05.881 --> 00:15:08.245
the cook got sick with pneumonia,

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:12.174
another cook came and he got flu, you see?

00:15:12.199 --> 00:15:13.446
This lady didn’t mind.

00:15:13.446 --> 00:15:15.646
“She said, ‘No, that’s my style.’"

00:15:15.646 --> 00:15:19.925
So she asked Me, "What should we do with such people, Mother?"

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:23.031
I said, "You should have asked her
that ‘We have this thing.

00:15:23.056 --> 00:15:26.001
If you like it well and good; otherwise you don’t eat,

00:15:26.026 --> 00:15:30.189
it’s all right, good. Fasting is a very good thing.’

00:15:30.983 --> 00:15:35.762
That’s the only solution for such people who are so self-centered

00:15:35.787 --> 00:15:39.270
and so much bothering others.”

00:15:39.318 --> 00:15:42.383
So this self-centeredness comes to us

00:15:42.399 --> 00:15:45.256
because we think, "This is our dharma,

00:15:45.281 --> 00:15:49.886
this is our right, this is - everything belongs to us.

00:15:49.911 --> 00:15:52.791
How dare they do not do it?"

00:15:52.816 --> 00:15:57.300
How much we trouble others, how much we make them inconvenient,

00:15:57.419 --> 00:16:04.647
how much we try to make their lives miserable,
we never think.

00:16:05.137 --> 00:16:07.608
We go on demanding things,

00:16:08.704 --> 00:16:12.680
“This is my dharma, what can I do?

00:16:13.094 --> 00:16:15.078
This is what I have to do.”

00:16:15.103 --> 00:16:18.404
But it becomes such a conditioning of the mind

00:16:18.809 --> 00:16:22.291
that I have seen many cases in Sahaja Yoga

00:16:22.316 --> 00:16:24.165
who got conditioned like that.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:28.945
There was a lady, French lady who came to Sahaja Yoga,

00:16:29.026 --> 00:16:33.154
and her mother was very ritualistic to begin with,

00:16:33.384 --> 00:16:39.613
and she was so troublesome that she must go to church every Sunday.

00:16:39.905 --> 00:16:45.008
She would dress up well, go to church and come back home.

00:16:45.652 --> 00:16:48.122
And one day she just disappeared.

00:16:48.274 --> 00:16:51.318
So they told the police to find out this lady,

00:16:51.739 --> 00:16:55.250
and when he went to find out the lady,
the police said that

00:16:55.275 --> 00:16:58.618
"We can’t find her, God knows where she has disappeared."

00:16:58.847 --> 00:17:02.208
Then she said, "All right, go and find out in the church."

00:17:02.276 --> 00:17:04.512
She was still sitting in the church.

00:17:04.643 --> 00:17:06.873
Next time again she disappeared.

00:17:06.937 --> 00:17:08.687
It happened three, four times.

00:17:08.712 --> 00:17:11.711
So the police said, "Sorry, we are finished with her.

00:17:11.736 --> 00:17:17.066
Now if you want you can put her in
the old people’s house, and that’s all."

00:17:17.362 --> 00:17:20.526
So they sent her to an old people’s house.

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:25.323
So this Sahaja Yogini told Me, "Mother, very surprising,

00:17:25.442 --> 00:17:28.196
they are otherwise very stupid people,

00:17:28.283 --> 00:17:33.633
they go on sitting, brooding, talking nonsense like mad,

00:17:33.658 --> 00:17:38.901
they have all become senile and their senility can be very well seen.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:44.968
But what happens that on a Sunday
they all dress up well and go to church.

00:17:45.799 --> 00:17:49.369
That’s the only point where they are sane."

00:17:49.394 --> 00:17:52.769
It is very surprising how the conditioning works.

00:17:52.794 --> 00:17:55.595
There was one person I had

00:17:55.738 --> 00:17:59.801
who came and stayed with us, and he said, "I’m very good driver."

00:17:59.926 --> 00:18:01.409
So I said, "All right."

00:18:01.434 --> 00:18:04.118
But he only know driving, he didn’t know about London,

00:18:04.143 --> 00:18:06.444
what sort of a place London is.

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:09.234
Now he knew the driving very well,

00:18:09.259 --> 00:18:13.785
but if I had to go to the north, he’ll drive Me to the south.

00:18:14.008 --> 00:18:17.654
If I had to go to the east, he’ll drive Me to the west.

00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:19.255
I said, "What’s the matter?

00:18:19.255 --> 00:18:23.012
You know driving?"
"Yes, I know driving, that I know,

00:18:23.091 --> 00:18:26.886
but I don’t know anything about road, I have no road sense."

00:18:27.052 --> 00:18:28.880
One day the police got hold of him.

00:18:28.905 --> 00:18:30.380
I was also in the car.

00:18:30.405 --> 00:18:32.460
He said, "Where are you going?"

00:18:32.809 --> 00:18:35.903
He said, "I am going to such and such place."

00:18:35.928 --> 00:18:39.787
So he said, "Now you have been to this place six times.

00:18:39.812 --> 00:18:43.571
Again you are coming back to the same point six times!"

00:18:43.596 --> 00:18:47.973
So in the old age I have known that these things form

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:50.116
a kind of a habit,

00:18:50.201 --> 00:18:53.946
but in young age also you can find people

00:18:54.042 --> 00:18:57.097
get so conditioned by their style.

00:18:57.188 --> 00:19:02.553
So this is what you can call the human element,

00:19:02.578 --> 00:19:07.888
where you get attached or get bothered about something.

00:19:08.936 --> 00:19:14.620
Now it’s a kind of a, I should say, a madness

00:19:14.859 --> 00:19:18.128
that somebody demands this, somebody demands that,

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.236
"I don’t like this, I don’t like that."

00:19:21.236 --> 00:19:23.781
It goes on, and on, and on.

00:19:23.947 --> 00:19:29.008
It’s so common to say "I don’t like,” “I like."

00:19:29.379 --> 00:19:33.718
It is very surprising that they go on saying like this.

00:19:33.743 --> 00:19:37.904
They go to somebody’s house, "No, no, I don’t like this carpet."

00:19:37.929 --> 00:19:41.752
I mean, it’s not your carpet, you’ve not purchased it.

00:19:41.777 --> 00:19:43.672
This person has purchased the carpet.

00:19:43.697 --> 00:19:45.610
What have you got to do?

00:19:45.635 --> 00:19:47.313
Why should you say "I don’t like"?

00:19:47.338 --> 00:19:48.441
Who are you?

00:19:48.466 --> 00:19:49.927
You have not paid for you.

00:19:49.952 --> 00:19:53.080
The one who has paid likes it, finished!

00:19:53.199 --> 00:19:56.408
Why do you want to pass your remarks, "I don’t like it"?

00:19:56.433 --> 00:19:59.699
Are you a connoisseur, so to criticize others?

00:19:59.935 --> 00:20:03.777
Somebody is wearing, supposing, the hairdress in a way,

00:20:03.928 --> 00:20:07.018
but "I don’t like this kind of hairdress."

00:20:07.098 --> 00:20:08.284
"Why?"

00:20:08.309 --> 00:20:12.187
"I don’t like, that’s all."

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:22.294
Then it goes from there to human beings and everyone.

00:20:22.469 --> 00:20:26.543
Who are you to like or dislike?

00:20:26.805 --> 00:20:28.749
What is your position?

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:33.802
Why should you say “I like” or “don’t like”?

00:20:34.764 --> 00:20:37.830
But is very common, specially in the West,

00:20:38.021 --> 00:20:42.361
to pass such remarks, "I don’t like it."

00:20:42.728 --> 00:20:44.488
"I don’t like India."

00:20:44.513 --> 00:20:46.616
"All right, if you don’t like, sit at home.

00:20:46.641 --> 00:20:48.354
Why did you come here?"

00:20:48.403 --> 00:20:50.529
"I don’t like Turkey."

00:20:50.837 --> 00:20:52.124
"Why?"

00:20:52.296 --> 00:20:57.313
Because if supposing anybody is wearing a long skirt,

00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:01.911
they’ll say, "No, I don’t like it because it is Turkish."

00:21:02.442 --> 00:21:05.367
So you should only wear short skirts.

00:21:05.645 --> 00:21:08.729
But we don’t like short skirts, supposing.

00:21:08.754 --> 00:21:11.957
But one should not say that "I don’t like it,"

00:21:11.982 --> 00:21:17.605
because it hurts people, it takes awaythe pride of the person.

00:21:18.835 --> 00:21:22.557
Now when you are in Sahaja Yoga

00:21:22.589 --> 00:21:26.767
you must know that you are not normal human being,

00:21:26.792 --> 00:21:32.174
according to the normal standards, you see, you are above them.

00:21:32.597 --> 00:21:36.697
Your likes and dislikes are different from theirs,

00:21:36.896 --> 00:21:39.777
and your whole attitude has changed.

00:21:40.454 --> 00:21:45.126
You are, sometimes you are just like children, I have seen.

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:50.529
You talk like small little children, very innocently,

00:21:50.576 --> 00:21:54.382
and sometimes you talk very profound things.

00:21:54.763 --> 00:21:58.966
Now this is unknown to people who are supposed to be normal,

00:21:59.054 --> 00:22:02.920
because normal people, you know, they are so bombastic,

00:22:02.945 --> 00:22:08.405
all the time they go on saying "I, I, I."

00:22:09.471 --> 00:22:17.677
Kabira has said that when a goat is living,

00:22:18.098 --> 00:22:22.533
she goes on saying "meh, meh, meh," means "I, I, I."

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:29.845
But when she is dead and her intestines are drawn into

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:37.592
a kind of a wire for, we call dhunak - means

00:22:37.617 --> 00:22:41.749
“with which they separate the seeds from the cotton"

00:22:41.821 --> 00:22:45.587
- that time, what she says, "tu hi, tu hi, tu hi”:

00:22:45.612 --> 00:22:51.959
“you are, you are, you are." You are...

00:22:53.396 --> 00:23:00.046
When you say that, immediately
your attention goes away from others,

00:23:00.214 --> 00:23:04.768
finding faults with them, finding what’s wrong with them,

00:23:04.855 --> 00:23:09.395
using your brains all the time to criticize others,

00:23:09.763 --> 00:23:14.981
to make fun of others, sometimes even to talk ill of others.

00:23:15.007 --> 00:23:17.238
People enjoy gossips.

00:23:17.342 --> 00:23:18.579
Why?

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:20.816
They enjoy gossip

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:25.896
because they don’t know that another person is the same as myself,

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.853
and I have no business to gossip about that person.

00:23:29.878 --> 00:23:33.916
So this understanding, I should say this loving

00:23:33.941 --> 00:23:38.577
wisdom doesn’t exist when you are a normal human being.

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:43.632
At the slightest provocation you can get angry,

00:23:43.761 --> 00:23:48.670
start doing all kinds of things just like a bull in the

00:23:49.012 --> 00:23:51.702
china shop, you can behave any way.

00:23:51.853 --> 00:23:55.676
Suddenly you’ll find them just growing up into that.

00:23:55.701 --> 00:23:59.911
The reason for that is, you are not yet a Sahaja Yogi.

00:24:00.594 --> 00:24:05.258
But Sahaja Yogi is a person who enjoys all kinds of things.

00:24:06.092 --> 00:24:11.795
Say somebody becomes very angry and hot-tempered.

00:24:12.498 --> 00:24:19.583
He also sees that what is happening, how he is behaving.

00:24:20.108 --> 00:24:26.108
So, actually it is not a dharma
that you get angry with someone, it’s not.

00:24:26.179 --> 00:24:31.080
It is something very low to be angry with others,

00:24:31.086 --> 00:24:36.359
to be all the time shouting at others,
to be exacting things from others

00:24:36.384 --> 00:24:41.683
or to criticize others, thinking you are something great.

00:24:41.828 --> 00:24:43.590
And this doesn’t pay.

00:24:44.462 --> 00:24:47.345
By the time you come to the end of life you’ll find

00:24:47.369 --> 00:24:50.885
you haven’t got one friend, one neighbor.

00:24:52.109 --> 00:24:56.997
Another thing is that when you are very egoistical,

00:24:57.648 --> 00:25:00.113
you think no end of yourself

00:25:00.209 --> 00:25:04.259
and you go on talking, jabbering, talking, jabbering,

00:25:04.394 --> 00:25:07.488
and the another person just gets bored stiff;

00:25:07.725 --> 00:25:11.032
but still you are talking, talking, talking about yourself,

00:25:11.082 --> 00:25:13.720
"I did this, I did this, I went there.

00:25:13.745 --> 00:25:15.865
I, I, I…"

00:25:17.582 --> 00:25:23.746
It goes to any limit,
and you are not ashamed as to what you are saying.

00:25:25.014 --> 00:25:31.262
I have seen people who have taken to all kinds of

00:25:31.567 --> 00:25:38.182
funny attitudes towards others,
when they are just normal human beings.

00:25:39.121 --> 00:25:45.412
If somebody says something wrong about somebody,
somebody says that

00:25:45.526 --> 00:25:49.909
"That person is like this, I know, you see he did this way."

00:25:49.934 --> 00:25:54.074
Immediately it goes into their mind, "Yes, it’s so."

00:25:54.518 --> 00:26:00.988
Now that makes your mind a sick mind,

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:06.765
we can say vikrudh, where the mind is not normal.

00:26:06.988 --> 00:26:10.838
You become sick, and you accept all this sickness

00:26:10.941 --> 00:26:18.221
and go on accepting it, accepting it till you are a sick person,

00:26:18.704 --> 00:26:23.516
and this sickness is extremely dangerous.

00:26:23.651 --> 00:26:26.568
Not for others so much as for yourself,

00:26:26.703 --> 00:26:30.957
because nobody can stand such a sick personality.

00:26:31.384 --> 00:26:37.274
Now you might say, I’ve seen people who have taken to religion.

00:26:37.583 --> 00:26:43.745
Like now I am a religious person, supposing now.

00:26:45.579 --> 00:26:49.253
You better be religious, so what?

00:26:49.278 --> 00:26:51.531
You can’t do this, you can’t do that,

00:26:51.603 --> 00:26:56.144
you cannot sit here, you cannot eat this, this is important:

00:26:56.169 --> 00:27:01.580
all try type the discipline others,
instead of disciplining yourself.

00:27:02.104 --> 00:27:06.283
Because when you are a normal person you don’t see yourself,

00:27:06.792 --> 00:27:11.247
you just see others; but once you are a realized soul,

00:27:11.278 --> 00:27:17.009
you just start watching yourself and see for yourself what’s wrong.

00:27:17.928 --> 00:27:24.692
Now after becoming the Spirit,
in the light of the Spirit you see yourself.

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.596
You just see yourself.

00:27:28.314 --> 00:27:31.664
What happens, how you behave

00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:37.958
and how you enjoy yourself, when you know how to correct yourself.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:40.100
It’s very sweet.

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:44.770
Little, little things you do in such a beautiful manner,

00:27:44.834 --> 00:27:47.849
and you’ll say such beautiful things.

00:27:47.881 --> 00:27:54.691
Of course there are people
who cannot be corrected, they’re incorrigible.

00:27:54.716 --> 00:28:00.045
So also you should just see this is incorrigible, you can’t help it.

00:28:00.156 --> 00:28:03.035
Like in Sahaja Yoga we have some people

00:28:03.099 --> 00:28:07.038
who are all the time trying to help the wrong type of people,

00:28:07.358 --> 00:28:11.772
like they have taken a power of attorney in Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:11.797 --> 00:28:15.851
So if somebody tries to be funny,

00:28:16.026 --> 00:28:19.542
we expect a telephone call from that power of attorney.

00:28:19.667 --> 00:28:22.826
After two hours, he tells, “Now,

00:28:22.851 --> 00:28:27.256
please tell Mother that such and such person is to be looked after.

00:28:27.281 --> 00:28:29.456
This has to be done, that has to be done.”

00:28:29.456 --> 00:28:32.660
It’s absolutely a habitual thing with them

00:28:32.685 --> 00:28:36.824
to inform Me that “No, You must help, You must do something.”

00:28:37.767 --> 00:28:40.719
But now it has become such a common practice,

00:28:40.766 --> 00:28:44.497
and we know that he will just now come along

00:28:44.536 --> 00:28:47.693
and give us a big lecture on this subject.

00:28:47.898 --> 00:28:53.293
So you see, it’s a nature of a human being

00:28:53.349 --> 00:28:58.378
which has been going through the different types of

00:28:58.726 --> 00:29:05.623
complications in life,  also born with some genes or something

00:29:05.756 --> 00:29:11.744
that he is not a very normal person, though we say he’s normal;

00:29:11.902 --> 00:29:18.319
because the way he reacts, the reaction that he shows is very absurd.

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:22.904
There’s no need for anybody to telephone to Me, to tell Me

00:29:22.929 --> 00:29:29.557
that “You see, this man is such and such, You better look after him.”

00:29:29.946 --> 00:29:34.627
Unnecessarily to interfere with others’ affairs

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:37.635
when you have no authority,

00:29:38.325 --> 00:29:41.591
when you have nothing to do with that person.

00:29:41.682 --> 00:29:46.105
All sorts of, I can tell you, designs are there that

00:29:46.288 --> 00:29:50.362
has been made into the minds of human beings,

00:29:50.481 --> 00:29:54.970
and these designs all disappear, just disappear.

00:29:55.097 --> 00:29:58.704
I don’t know how they get all these designs, from where they get it -

00:29:58.776 --> 00:30:03.235
maybe their country, maybe their family, maybe their genes -

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:08.384
whatever you may say, all this disappears, even your genes change.

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:15.386
That is what is Sahaja Yoga,
where you become the Spirit; everything changes.

00:30:15.681 --> 00:30:20.622
And what happens to you, that you become

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:26.289
a person who knows what is joy, who enjoys joy,

00:30:26.314 --> 00:30:30.851
who enjoys existence, who gives joy to others,

00:30:30.876 --> 00:30:36.406
makes others happy, all the time thinks how to make others happy.

00:30:36.572 --> 00:30:38.740
Just it happens,

00:30:38.828 --> 00:30:42.299
though you are brought up the same way as others are,

00:30:42.324 --> 00:30:46.386
though you are being educated the same way,  maybe;

00:30:46.584 --> 00:30:53.791
but all that disappears
and you become a wise, beautiful joyous person.

00:30:55.789 --> 00:31:00.087
It’s something that you have achieved, of which you may not be aware,

00:31:00.127 --> 00:31:05.097
the way you are enjoying in this scout-ground.

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:08.485
No other group could have enjoyed as you have enjoyed.

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:12.433
I can see what you are doing here and how you are enjoying,

00:31:12.751 --> 00:31:16.171
how you are enjoying the company of others,
it’s very remarkable;

00:31:16.472 --> 00:31:21.789
and that has come because your heart is full of joy

00:31:21.884 --> 00:31:24.511
of the Spirit that shines within you.

00:31:24.961 --> 00:31:27.943
You can examine yourself and see for yourself

00:31:27.983 --> 00:31:31.498
whatever I‘m saying is there or not of course,

00:31:31.568 --> 00:31:34.686
There are some people who think no end of themself,

00:31:34.711 --> 00:31:38.361
they are staying in a hotel or some lodge, or something.

00:31:38.496 --> 00:31:40.034
They are not enjoying.

00:31:40.582 --> 00:31:43.191
They still think that they are something great,

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:47.301
so they must stay somewhere like that.

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:50.388
Very surprisingly, specially Indians I have seen,

00:31:50.413 --> 00:31:56.232
when they come to Cabella they all want to stay in a hotel.

00:31:56.358 --> 00:32:00.708
In their lives they might be having one bathroom in their house,

00:32:00.866 --> 00:32:04.236
but when they come to Cabella they want to stay in a hotel

00:32:04.261 --> 00:32:07.720
with attached bath,  this, that;

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.667
young people, it’s very surprising.

00:32:11.771 --> 00:32:15.698
It happens because I think they have never seen a good hotel,

00:32:15.723 --> 00:32:19.097
or may be that they have lived in a very bad condition.

00:32:19.168 --> 00:32:25.000
But a person who is a Sahaja Yogi
can live anywhere, can sleep anywhere.

00:32:25.613 --> 00:32:31.562
Only thing is that his Spirit is there to make him happy,
nothing else.

00:32:31.799 --> 00:32:34.844
That is the One that gives you happiness.

00:32:34.869 --> 00:32:41.319
All these other ideas that human beings have,
which have created problems after problems.

00:32:43.157 --> 00:32:48.066
Now you see, because you belong to a different religion, you are bad.

00:32:48.334 --> 00:32:51.056
If you want to know about the Christians,

00:32:51.112 --> 00:32:54.123
you’d better go and ask the Jews;

00:32:54.148 --> 00:32:58.154
and if you want to know about the Jews, better go and ask the Muslims;

00:32:58.179 --> 00:33:02.458
and if you want to know about the Muslims, go and ask the Hindus.

00:33:03.357 --> 00:33:06.935
You’ll be amazed how they talk about other people

00:33:07.022 --> 00:33:10.282
as if all of them are bad, and they are the best.

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:15.466
So this whole attitude changes completely.

00:33:15.702 --> 00:33:20.718
You forget it: who is what, whose religion is what,

00:33:20.743 --> 00:33:26.463
from what sort of family they come in,
from what is the background they are coming in.

00:33:26.575 --> 00:33:29.767
They become just one with each other.

00:33:29.952 --> 00:33:34.222
What they enjoy is the company of all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:33:34.556 --> 00:33:37.760
All the Sahaja Yogis are there, that’s all.

00:33:37.839 --> 00:33:42.059
So many Sahaja Yogis will be there, and that is the Mecca,

00:33:42.111 --> 00:33:47.145
that is the Kumbha Mela, that you can call anything if you like.

00:33:47.255 --> 00:33:51.094
The collective joy that you enjoy has come to you

00:33:51.178 --> 00:33:55.112
because you have crossed, crossed thatbarrier

00:33:55.192 --> 00:33:59.617
which has stopped you from seeing the truth.

00:33:59.998 --> 00:34:04.806
The truth is, as I said yesterday, that you are the Spirit,

00:34:04.831 --> 00:34:13.222
and once you become the Spirit
you become gunatit, kalatit and dharmatit.

00:34:13.357 --> 00:34:19.733
Once you cross these limits, then you become like a drop in the ocean.

00:34:19.871 --> 00:34:23.146
If the drop is outside the ocean,

00:34:23.224 --> 00:34:27.081
it’s always frightened of the sun because it will dry it up;

00:34:27.392 --> 00:34:31.652
he doesn’t know what to do, which way to slip, which way to move.

00:34:31.677 --> 00:34:35.227
But once it is one with the ocean, it just moves

00:34:35.252 --> 00:34:39.396
and enjoy because he’s not alone, it’s not alone.

00:34:39.421 --> 00:34:45.370
It’s moving with the waves of that beautiful ocean of joy.

00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:49.789
And that is what you have achieved, of which you are aware;

00:34:49.814 --> 00:34:52.641
you know, but you don’t know you have achieved it,

00:34:52.689 --> 00:34:55.212
because you are the Spirit.

00:34:56.162 --> 00:34:58.530
Now you should be on the watch

00:34:59.165 --> 00:35:04.405
about yourself sometimes,
and you’d be amazed to see how you are changed,

00:35:05.176 --> 00:35:10.922
how you have become so simple and sensible and wise.

00:35:11.379 --> 00:35:14.836
So many problems come in the West because

00:35:14.861 --> 00:35:19.649
they are still stupid, I think, very stupid people.

00:35:19.775 --> 00:35:25.314
Because even an old man of eighty years

00:35:25.378 --> 00:35:30.695
would like to marry a lady who seen 20 years

00:35:31.226 --> 00:35:35.176
and he doesn’t understand why he is doing it,

00:35:35.955 --> 00:35:39.129
because he doesn’t accept his age,

00:35:39.196 --> 00:35:44.086
he doesn’t accept that "I am an old man,
I must behave like an old man."

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:51.348
He wants to marry a girl who can be his granddaughter.

00:35:51.705 --> 00:35:54.072
This is more common in the West.

00:35:54.097 --> 00:35:55.837
They always think like that.

00:35:55.862 --> 00:35:59.541
Any young girl they see, they think they should marry that girl.

00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:05.032
They may be just on their way to the grave,

00:36:05.191 --> 00:36:08.768
but doesn’t matter, they want to have a wife like that.

00:36:08.856 --> 00:36:11.055
This is the problem of the West.

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:12.894
Now how does it come?

00:36:12.919 --> 00:36:17.958
Because they don’t understand that we are old,

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:20.673
and to be old is to be proud.

00:36:20.698 --> 00:36:23.296
Now when I was five years,

00:36:23.321 --> 00:36:28.339
I cannot imagine so many people could have
come to wish Me a happy birthday.

00:36:28.609 --> 00:36:31.939
Even when I was fifty years there were not so many people.

00:36:31.964 --> 00:36:37.602
Now when I am seventy-five, see
how many people are there to wish Me happy birthday!

00:36:38.268 --> 00:36:41.911
When you are old you should be proud of your age,

00:36:42.094 --> 00:36:45.938
if you have lived wisely; but if you have been stupid,

00:36:45.963 --> 00:36:48.349
then of course nobody can help.

00:36:48.717 --> 00:36:53.795
Everybody will laugh at such a person,
but they will do the same thing.

00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:59.262
It’s a custom in the West to go on having wives after wives,

00:36:59.287 --> 00:37:01.574
divorcing your wife and this, that.

00:37:02.294 --> 00:37:04.872
In India it’s the other way round I should say,

00:37:04.897 --> 00:37:08.833
they don’t have much respect for the women.

00:37:08.889 --> 00:37:13.658
They were supposed to have great respect for women,

00:37:13.683 --> 00:37:18.805
supposed to have placed their women at the pedestal of a sati,

00:37:18.964 --> 00:37:23.230
and even if the woman may be anything, they don’t respect.

00:37:23.257 --> 00:37:26.892
Now this is from where it has come, I don’t know.

00:37:26.917 --> 00:37:32.703
Some of them say that it is written by some poet

00:37:33.513 --> 00:37:35.181
that a woman should be beaten up.

00:37:35.206 --> 00:37:36.476
I mean, who is this poet?

00:37:36.476 --> 00:37:39.676
He should be beaten up I think, first of all.

00:37:40.057 --> 00:37:45.622
He was born out of a woman, and here he writes like this.

00:37:45.778 --> 00:37:50.983
So you see, we like to take up something which is wrong,

00:37:51.269 --> 00:37:53.713
which is absolutely absurd.

00:37:53.848 --> 00:37:58.226
This comes because you are not wise.

00:37:58.554 --> 00:38:03.581
A wise person will take in whatever is the wisdom.

00:38:04.296 --> 00:38:07.722
He won’t accept anything nonsensical.

00:38:07.852 --> 00:38:11.830
You go on reading the books one after another, one after another.

00:38:11.989 --> 00:38:16.066
So many books you read, and where do you land up with that?

00:38:16.156 --> 00:38:20.348
You find you are reading books which are no good for you,

00:38:20.373 --> 00:38:25.015
useless, but if you are fond of reading, you go on reading.

00:38:26.364 --> 00:38:34.229
So the lack of wisdom gives you indiscrimination

00:38:34.698 --> 00:38:38.269
and you justify it, all that you justify

00:38:38.294 --> 00:38:40.606
and you say, "Now this is very good.

00:38:40.631 --> 00:38:42.957
Whatever I am doing is the best.”

00:38:42.982 --> 00:38:47.948
It’s not ego, I would say, but stupid human understanding.

00:38:48.472 --> 00:38:51.517
"Whatever I am doing is good.

00:38:51.542 --> 00:38:54.462
Whatever is my attitude is good.

00:38:54.487 --> 00:38:59.397
How dare anybody tell me anything that this is wrong, that is wrong?"

00:38:59.546 --> 00:39:03.436
Everybody will laugh at that person, make fun of that person.

00:39:03.517 --> 00:39:06.096
Such a person will suffer a lot, everything.

00:39:06.121 --> 00:39:11.266
But he will never accept that "I have done something wrong."

00:39:11.567 --> 00:39:16.328
So when you go beyond dharmatit you become, go beyond dharma,

00:39:16.353 --> 00:39:20.565
then what happens that dharma becomes part and parcel of you.

00:39:21.191 --> 00:39:25.741
You don’t do wrong things, you just don’t do it.

00:39:26.186 --> 00:39:29.604
It’s not that somebody is telling you or you want to follow it,

00:39:29.637 --> 00:39:32.455
or there is compulsion or you are disciplined,

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:36.381
but you just don’t like to do wrong things, to say something

00:39:36.406 --> 00:39:41.507
which is not respectful, which is not helpful, which is not loving.

00:39:41.768 --> 00:39:45.693
This is the quality of a Sahaja Yogi,

00:39:45.741 --> 00:39:48.463
where you become the Spirit.

00:39:48.688 --> 00:39:51.850
Becoming the Spirit, you don’t have to tell anybody,

00:39:51.906 --> 00:39:55.613
so obvious, so evident and one can see that,

00:39:55.727 --> 00:40:00.313
and the more you go deep into yourself, you find that

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:05.997
you are endowed with such greatness within you,

00:40:06.022 --> 00:40:11.544
such beautiful feelings, such nice things within you

00:40:11.569 --> 00:40:15.992
that you overcome the ego of others.

00:40:16.151 --> 00:40:17.871
I must tell you a story.

00:40:17.896 --> 00:40:21.434
Once I went to see a saint.

00:40:21.629 --> 00:40:22.836
So the Sahaja Yogis said,

00:40:22.837 --> 00:40:26.100
"Mother, You never go and see these gurus and this and that,

00:40:26.156 --> 00:40:28.491
so why do You go?"
I said, "You come along with Me."

00:40:28.516 --> 00:40:30.015
So we had to climb a lot.

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:31.992
I said, "From here you see his vibrations.

00:40:32.017 --> 00:40:33.638
First you see his vibrations.”

00:40:34.145 --> 00:40:36.783
So lots of vibrations were coming.

00:40:36.808 --> 00:40:41.049
So we went up the hill, climbed up.

00:40:41.364 --> 00:40:46.097
And this gentleman was supposed to have powers

00:40:46.185 --> 00:40:52.268
that he could control the rain, and it started raining,

00:40:52.379 --> 00:40:57.525
and raining very heavily,
and I got completely drenched in that rain.

00:40:57.646 --> 00:41:01.161
When I went up I saw him sitting on a stone,

00:41:01.186 --> 00:41:04.719
just shaking his head with anger or I don’t know what.

00:41:05.204 --> 00:41:08.087
So I went into his cave and sat down.

00:41:08.889 --> 00:41:14.134
So he came back, he came back and he said to Me,

00:41:14.159 --> 00:41:19.184
"Mother, why didn’t You allow me to stop the rain?

00:41:19.335 --> 00:41:22.600
Is it to overcome my ego?"

00:41:22.625 --> 00:41:26.774
I said, "No, not that, I didn’t want,

00:41:26.799 --> 00:41:31.494
I didn’t see your ego anywhere; but the problem is the another.

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:35.187
You are a sanyasi, you are a one who are an ascetic,

00:41:35.212 --> 00:41:36.852
you bought a sari for Me.

00:41:36.981 --> 00:41:41.455
Now if you bought a sari for Me,
I can’t take from you because you’re a sanyasi.

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:46.937
So I had to get drenched,
so that I will have to borrow sari from you."

00:41:46.962 --> 00:41:51.162
And the whole thing melted away.

00:41:51.385 --> 00:41:54.285
He became a very different person.

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:59.363
So with wisdom you know how to handle different types of people.

00:41:59.449 --> 00:42:06.337
You say things by which you melt their ego.

00:42:06.502 --> 00:42:15.951
Their conditionings also are brought into a kind of a new awakening.

00:42:17.102 --> 00:42:23.153
They see in you that wisdom, that love, that expression of,

00:42:23.296 --> 00:42:25.804
I should say, your Spirit.

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:32.943
And that’s how so many saints,
though they were tortured and troubled by many,

00:42:32.982 --> 00:42:38.266
but they were definitely very much respected and loved.

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:47.524
But those saints in those days, I must say,
were definitely very nice and good people,

00:42:47.632 --> 00:42:54.842
but one thing was there: they were rather strict
and disciplining with their disciples.

00:42:54.984 --> 00:42:59.762
The reason was that they were not realized souls, their disciples,

00:42:59.818 --> 00:43:05.361
and these gurus thought that “Unless and until
ou discipline these people,

00:43:05.472 --> 00:43:08.945
they’ll never rise, they’ll never become something great,

00:43:09.001 --> 00:43:11.131
so they have to be disciplined.”

00:43:11.156 --> 00:43:14.318
And those who were seekers of truth accepted

00:43:14.343 --> 00:43:17.965
that "All right, whatever you say, we’ll do.

00:43:18.069 --> 00:43:20.681
Even if you ask us to fast, we’ll do it.”

00:43:20.706 --> 00:43:23.535
They’ll stand on their heads, “All right, stand on our heads.

00:43:23.535 --> 00:43:26.860
Do what you say, and we will be willing to do it.

00:43:26.885 --> 00:43:29.449
You don’t have to worry on that point."

00:43:29.474 --> 00:43:32.461
And that’s how they were very disciplining type.

00:43:32.486 --> 00:43:35.966
But in Sahaja Yoga there is no discipline taught.

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:39.541
The reason is, you are realized souls,

00:43:39.566 --> 00:43:44.294
your Spirit is there and the Spirit gives you the light.

00:43:44.413 --> 00:43:50.243
In that light you see yourself so clearly,
and you can discipline yourself.

00:43:50.345 --> 00:43:52.235
I don’t have to tell you.

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:56.823
You know that so many people have given up drugs overnight,

00:43:56.863 --> 00:43:59.734
but I never told them, I never even talked about  drugs

00:43:59.759 --> 00:44:02.679
or anything, and how did they do it?

00:44:02.704 --> 00:44:07.340
Because they had the light, and this is what is you have got today,

00:44:07.365 --> 00:44:09.654
is the light of the Spirit.

00:44:09.718 --> 00:44:12.992
You become absolutely independent

00:44:13.127 --> 00:44:17.000
and absolutely free; complete freedom,

00:44:17.048 --> 00:44:19.549
because you have the light.

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:25.330
You cannot do, you cannot do wrong things.

00:44:26.297 --> 00:44:30.836
Supposing now there is light,

00:44:31.376 --> 00:44:36.892
and there is some sort of a big explosion taking place.

00:44:37.119 --> 00:44:40.167
I won’t run towards the explosion, no.

00:44:40.238 --> 00:44:44.881
You won’t run either, because you have got the eyes.

00:44:44.906 --> 00:44:49.966
So the Spirit and its light is the greatest guiding factor

00:44:50.292 --> 00:44:54.839
by which you become, as I said, gunatit,

00:44:56.945 --> 00:45:03.106
you become kalatit, and you become dharmatit.

00:45:03.708 --> 00:45:06.012
You are not slave of anything.

00:45:06.037 --> 00:45:09.782
You are not slave of your watch, you are not slave of time,

00:45:09.807 --> 00:45:14.943
you are not slave as to what is your gunas are.

00:45:15.069 --> 00:45:20.346
You don’t want to see whether
you are right-sided, left-sided or centered.

00:45:20.634 --> 00:45:28.442
You are a Sahaja Yogi, and a Sahaja Yogi is beyond all these things,
so you are gunatit.

00:45:28.749 --> 00:45:33.098
You are dharmatit because dharma becomes part and parcel of you.

00:45:33.153 --> 00:45:37.804
You don’t have to follow any disciplining of dharma.

00:45:37.829 --> 00:45:43.838
I have seen in Sahaja Yoga, in some of the ashrams
they are very strict.

00:45:44.068 --> 00:45:45.281
That should not be so.

00:45:45.306 --> 00:45:47.613
I have told them never to be strict.

00:45:47.638 --> 00:45:51.992
If somebody doesn’t get up at, say, four o’clock, doesn’t matter.

00:45:52.031 --> 00:45:54.295
Let him get up at ten o’clock.

00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:58.229
After some time he himself will get up at four,

00:45:58.262 --> 00:46:01.124
but don’t try to discipline them too much.

00:46:01.243 --> 00:46:04.263
Children also you should not discipline too much.

00:46:04.421 --> 00:46:09.257
Of course if they are realized souls, they themselves are so good,

00:46:09.282 --> 00:46:10.754
they are so beautiful.

00:46:10.779 --> 00:46:13.934
But if they are not, try to give them Realization.

00:46:13.959 --> 00:46:17.561
Once you realize that those who are not realized

00:46:17.625 --> 00:46:21.917
are making all these mistakes, that they are in the darkness,

00:46:21.942 --> 00:46:25.653
your attitude towards them will change.

00:46:25.753 --> 00:46:30.342
You will just try to be extremely patient

00:46:30.787 --> 00:46:34.794
and kind, and affectionate and loving,

00:46:34.859 --> 00:46:37.991
because you will know that person is not realized.

00:46:38.142 --> 00:46:42.776
He has not got his eyes, he can’t see, he is blind,

00:46:42.801 --> 00:46:48.568
he can’t hear, he can’t feel the reality.

00:46:48.829 --> 00:46:51.330
So first let him feel the reality.

00:46:51.355 --> 00:46:54.468
What is the use of giving him a lecture and disciplining?

00:46:54.493 --> 00:46:59.673
Still he’ll go on making mistakes
and troubling himself, or troubling others.

00:46:59.698 --> 00:47:02.012
So this is what you have achieved

00:47:02.037 --> 00:47:07.037
through your enlightenment, that you are beyond all these things.

00:47:07.704 --> 00:47:11.532
And you become a person of a temperament

00:47:11.604 --> 00:47:17.468
which is so loving and so joy-giving.

00:47:17.697 --> 00:47:23.160
I mean, it’s so many examples I can give in Sahaja Yoga
which has happened,

00:47:23.229 --> 00:47:28.039
that I have seen the beauty of their love and affection,

00:47:28.064 --> 00:47:32.020
not only towards Me, but only towards others also.

00:47:32.045 --> 00:47:37.691
Only if it is only towards Me I can explain it,

00:47:37.803 --> 00:47:43.050
but I can’t explain the way they are kind to people,
as I told you yesterday,

00:47:43.075 --> 00:47:45.302
that these people went to Israel,

00:47:45.327 --> 00:47:48.796
now they went to Egypt, they went to Russia.

00:47:48.821 --> 00:47:49.805
Who told them?

00:47:49.805 --> 00:47:52.181
I never asked anybody to go anywhere.

00:47:52.206 --> 00:47:55.747
On their own they felt they have to go  and do this job,

00:47:55.772 --> 00:48:01.306
and they have to help people to get out of their ignorance.

00:48:02.619 --> 00:48:07.106
So today, on such a day when you are celebrating

00:48:07.249 --> 00:48:12.002
My seventy-fifth Birthday, and so many balloons are there -

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:32.822
they are very remarkably, very picturesque

00:48:32.847 --> 00:48:38.509
and have colors of different types, expressing your love for Me.

00:48:39.853 --> 00:48:42.745
In everything I see your love.

00:48:42.866 --> 00:48:47.197
Whatever you have done here, all your decorations, everything,

00:48:47.332 --> 00:48:52.800
I feel My children are so loving.

00:48:53.182 --> 00:48:58.258
I have done nothing for you,
I don’t know what makes you feel such gratitude.

00:48:58.401 --> 00:49:00.906
I still want to know, what have I done?

00:49:00.931 --> 00:49:02.437
I have done nothing!

00:49:02.462 --> 00:49:05.507
But the way you want to express your love,

00:49:05.587 --> 00:49:09.994
it’s very surprising; except for, I would say,

00:49:10.019 --> 00:49:14.679
that you got the light of your Spirit.

00:49:14.778 --> 00:49:19.831
In that light, might be you see something different in Me,

00:49:20.903 --> 00:49:27.625
but the way you are showing your gratitude is really beyond Me.

00:49:27.751 --> 00:49:30.646
As the other day, one of the speakers said that

00:49:30.671 --> 00:49:33.401
“You don’t thank your mother, take her for granted.”

00:49:33.426 --> 00:49:34.506
It’s a fact.

00:49:34.679 --> 00:49:38.469
There’s no need to thank Me, you have to take Me for granted.

00:49:38.494 --> 00:49:42.052
But the way you want to thank Me, just like a

00:49:42.077 --> 00:49:47.238
small little child would like to thank, you just become like children.

00:49:47.485 --> 00:49:50.079
You’re so enthusiastic about it,

00:49:50.111 --> 00:49:56.437
and you don’t understand that
normally is not done like this anywhere;

00:49:56.532 --> 00:50:02.456
nobody tries to be just like children expressing
their beautiful love.

00:50:02.898 --> 00:50:08.050
It’s a very new thing that one can see.

00:50:08.199 --> 00:50:13.757
Such peace, such love, such joy all around

00:50:14.051 --> 00:50:19.334
in a far-fetched place like this, how could you do that?

00:50:19.768 --> 00:50:21.577
How could you manage that?

00:50:21.902 --> 00:50:29.143
It’s not easy to understand,
it’s not for human beings to see that.

00:50:29.831 --> 00:50:33.613
They just don’t understand how these people are like this,

00:50:33.653 --> 00:50:37.992
and why are they living like this so happily?

00:50:38.443 --> 00:50:43.893
Now you have comforts in the house,
you are living so well in your houses,

00:50:44.044 --> 00:50:47.147
everything is there, but here in this scout-ground

00:50:47.164 --> 00:50:49.937
it’s not such a comfortable place to live.

00:50:49.962 --> 00:50:52.943
But you can live anywhere, I know, I have seen it.

00:50:52.968 --> 00:50:56.101
Wherever you are, as long as there are Sahaja Yogis around,

00:50:56.149 --> 00:50:58.236
you don’t care for anything.

00:50:58.261 --> 00:51:03.417
And this collective enjoyment of each other,

00:51:03.568 --> 00:51:06.940
without any expectation, without any criticism,

00:51:06.965 --> 00:51:11.985
without any gossip or any nonsense like that, is so beautiful.

00:51:12.017 --> 00:51:16.272
And even when you pull each other’s legs,
you know, I enjoy your jokes

00:51:16.297 --> 00:51:22.972
and understand that it’s such friendship,
such beautiful friendship.

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:29.593
Whether you are from India or from England
or from America, or from any other place,

00:51:29.618 --> 00:51:33.773
you find there’s such oneness of understanding,

00:51:33.877 --> 00:51:40.024
oneness of movement,  like one waves rises

00:51:40.049 --> 00:51:43.679
and another wave rises, and another wave rises.

00:51:43.704 --> 00:51:51.862
It’s continuous, eternal, and this is
what one has to achieve for others also.

00:51:52.095 --> 00:51:57.609
For that also, must remember that
you have the light; others don’t have.

00:51:57.655 --> 00:52:03.089
So you have to be very considerate, tolerant and understanding

00:52:03.114 --> 00:52:07.960
about their problem, and just listen to them.

00:52:08.046 --> 00:52:09.373
What is their problem?

00:52:09.398 --> 00:52:14.265
First they’ll tell you that “My business is going down,”

00:52:14.321 --> 00:52:19.424
or they might say that  “My wife is no good,”

00:52:19.503 --> 00:52:24.270
or “My son has no job, he is not working.”

00:52:24.305 --> 00:52:26.806
All kinds of things they might tell you.

00:52:26.831 --> 00:52:31.169
Listen, listen to them, for them it is important, all right.

00:52:31.194 --> 00:52:37.427
After that you will find gradually, you see,
they’ll soothe down

00:52:37.555 --> 00:52:42.874
because you are emitting love,  you are emitting joy,

00:52:42.906 --> 00:52:49.534
you are emitting confidence through your spiritual awakening.

00:52:49.559 --> 00:52:52.213
You have those powers.

00:52:52.336 --> 00:52:56.788
You just stand anywhere and you can create peace in that place,

00:52:56.813 --> 00:52:59.435
you can create happiness in that place.

00:52:59.486 --> 00:53:05.840
So be confident, don’t lose your confidence.

00:53:05.991 --> 00:53:13.083
Also your wisdom to understand others will be very much convincing

00:53:13.108 --> 00:53:17.794
for other people to understand that
“They are something exceptional.

00:53:17.873 --> 00:53:21.109
They don’t get angry, they don’t get into temper,

00:53:21.165 --> 00:53:25.009
they are not mad people,
they are not after some sort of a craze -

00:53:25.034 --> 00:53:29.442
just very, very balanced people."

00:53:29.858 --> 00:53:32.231
And this you don’t have to practice.

00:53:32.256 --> 00:53:33.551
It is there.

00:53:33.590 --> 00:53:36.901
It is within you, and you should be proud of it.

00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:42.600
You should not think that it is something

00:53:42.688 --> 00:53:47.962
that you have to achieve, or to become.

00:53:47.987 --> 00:53:50.710
You have it, within yourself you have it.

00:53:50.735 --> 00:53:56.355
Only thing that you have to see in the light of the Spirit yourself.

00:53:57.743 --> 00:54:03.066
It just is a very simple thing, and that works out.

00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:07.835
It is not easy for others to understand you,

00:54:07.954 --> 00:54:11.026
but it should be very easy to understand them;

00:54:11.051 --> 00:54:13.961
because you were like that before,

00:54:13.986 --> 00:54:21.305
and now they are seeing you and they will become like you.

00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:23.747
It’s very simple.

00:54:23.772 --> 00:54:28.371
You can see this, that I started Sahaja Yoga with one lady.

00:54:28.396 --> 00:54:30.834
And now today, see how many are there.

00:54:30.866 --> 00:54:34.275
Now what have I done, I really don’t know, what have I done?

00:54:34.275 --> 00:54:36.347
I have no idea.

00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:40.852
And what you think, such gratitude and enjoyment and joy!

00:54:41.701 --> 00:54:44.502
So all these things, whatever I have told you,

00:54:44.733 --> 00:54:50.274
you have to be aware of your being,  of your own Self,

00:54:50.322 --> 00:54:55.542
of your Spirit, that you are the Spirit.

00:54:55.778 --> 00:55:01.149
And as you are the Spirit, you are beyond all these things.

00:55:01.331 --> 00:55:07.864
And once that happens, you’ll be amazed what a personality you are.

00:55:08.324 --> 00:58:01.135
(Shri Mataji continues in Hindi)
