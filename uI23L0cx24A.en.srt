1
00:00:07,012 --> 00:00:17,498
Today we are here to celebrate the day when
the Sahastrara was opened out.

2
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:21,367
Also you have seen in the photograph.

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:31,331
It was actually a photograph of my brain, which
showed how the Sahastrara was opened out.

4
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:36,311
The light of the brain now could be photographed.

5
00:00:36,311 --> 00:00:40,850
It’s something great these modern times
have done.

6
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:46,781
So the modern times have brought a lot of
things which can prove the existence of the

7
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:48,771
Divine.

8
00:00:48,771 --> 00:00:56,331
Also it can prove about me.

9
00:00:56,331 --> 00:01:01,931
It can convince you what I am.

10
00:01:01,931 --> 00:01:13,301
This is very important because, in the modern
times, this advent has to be recognised, has

11
00:01:13,301 --> 00:01:14,631
to be fully recognised.

12
00:01:14,631 --> 00:01:21,801
This is one of the conditions for all the
Sahaja Yogis.

13
00:01:22,022 --> 00:01:33,612
So first is the breaking of the Sahastrara,
then once it opened out, the brahmarandhra

14
00:01:33,612 --> 00:01:51,372
opened out, then we started feeling the grace,
and it moved onto our Ida and Pingala – the

15
00:01:51,372 --> 00:01:55,731
grace not the Kundalini.

16
00:01:55,731 --> 00:02:05,281
And the grace, which is chaitanya, all round,
soothed down our Left and Right sides by which

17
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:14,511
our chakras opened more, and more threads
of the Kundalini started piercing through.

18
00:02:14,511 --> 00:02:21,632
So I always tell Sahaja Yogis that it’s
important that you must meditate.

19
00:02:21,632 --> 00:02:28,691
If your Sahastrara is alright, all your chakras
will be alright because, as you know, that

20
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:36,452
the peethas, or the controlling centres of
all these chakras, are in the brain around

21
00:02:36,452 --> 00:02:39,372
the limbic area.

22
00:02:39,372 --> 00:02:49,292
So if your Sahastrara is clear everything
works out in a very different way.

23
00:02:49,292 --> 00:02:56,032
How to keep the Sahastrara alright, is the
big problem [which] always people ask me.

24
00:02:56,032 --> 00:02:58,582
You know that I reside in the Sahastrara.

25
00:02:58,582 --> 00:03:06,152
I have incarnated on the lotus of one thousand
petals.

26
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:12,231
That’s why I could break it also.

27
00:03:12,231 --> 00:03:15,792
As I am today, as you see me.

28
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:20,562
Of course they say, “Sahastrare Mahamaya”
(सहस्त्रारे महामाया)

29
00:03:20,562 --> 00:03:30,681
So this is the illusion which is all the time
there for you, which is very elusive.

30
00:03:30,681 --> 00:03:38,171
It had to be that way because you could not
have faced me otherwise with all the lights

31
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:49,752
coming out of me or the way you saw yesterday
Sahastrara – some sort of abstract colours

32
00:03:49,752 --> 00:03:52,637
thrown on all sides and the lights thrown
outside.

33
00:03:52,769 --> 00:04:00,658
Now this Sahastrara is to be looked after
by you.

34
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:06,210
It’s the temple of your Mother.

35
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:10,970
When you say you put me in the heart, actually
you put me in the Sahastrara.

36
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:16,299
Because, as you know, the brahmarandhra here
(Shri Mataji touches her brahmarandhra) is

37
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:24,130
the fontanel bone area, has got the peetha,
the centre, which controls the heart, which

38
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:30,083
is the seat of the Sadashiva or you can say
of Shiva.

39
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:35,323
So when you put me in the heart actually you
put me there.

40
00:04:35,323 --> 00:04:43,042
So to raise it from heart to there, or to
bring it from there to the heart, is the problem

41
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:50,433
of two types of people.

42
00:04:50,433 --> 00:04:59,292
Some people who are sensitive in their heart
– I would say in Europe we can say Italians

43
00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:02,994
are very sensitive on their heart – the
first thing they do as soon as they see me

44
00:05:02,994 --> 00:05:10,763
they put their hands to their heart.

45
00:05:10,763 --> 00:05:19,523
And that is what it is, that, if you try to
feel me in your heart, to begin with, it’s

46
00:05:19,523 --> 00:05:21,423
much easier.

47
00:05:21,423 --> 00:05:24,583
To feel me in your heart.

48
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:36,282
Now you might say, “How to do it?”

49
00:05:36,282 --> 00:05:43,293
You have to love me as I love you.

50
00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:52,123
You have to love each one of yourselves, because
you are all within me.

51
00:05:52,123 --> 00:05:57,912
And you cannot teach someone how to love.

52
00:05:57,912 --> 00:05:59,282
Love is within.

53
00:05:59,282 --> 00:06:07,563
And love manifests if, just, you open your
heart.

54
00:06:07,563 --> 00:06:14,232
Now what stops it, we should examine that.

55
00:06:14,232 --> 00:06:17,423
Firstly, the conditioning.

56
00:06:17,423 --> 00:06:24,972
In the West to express your love is regarded
as sinful actually.

57
00:06:24,972 --> 00:06:30,813
It takes them time to say, “I love you,”
but “I hate you!” even a child could go

58
00:06:30,813 --> 00:06:32,683
on saying, “I hate you!

59
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:33,803
I hate you!

60
00:06:33,803 --> 00:06:34,933
I hate you!”

61
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:36,883
But to hate someone is sinful.

62
00:06:36,883 --> 00:06:42,092
To anyone, to hate, is sinful.

63
00:06:42,092 --> 00:06:43,092
So to say that, “I hate you!

64
00:06:43,092 --> 00:06:51,183
I hate you!” is a sinful act.

65
00:06:51,183 --> 00:07:02,792
So what one has to do is to say, [to] go on
saying, “I love you."

66
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:11,723
After all, you must love a person who is so
dear to you.

67
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:21,083
Anyone who has done something good for you,
you love that person.

68
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:28,363
But if the Adi Shakti Herself has given you
the rebirth, it should be the easiest thing

69
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:33,433
to love.

70
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:42,683
And if She says that, “They are all within
my body,” so it should be even easier to

71
00:07:42,683 --> 00:07:45,573
love each other.

72
00:07:45,573 --> 00:07:58,873
So the whole cleansing of the Sahastrara is
done through this love, this love which is

73
00:07:58,873 --> 00:08:12,193
not conditioned, which is not inhibited, which
doesn’t want any respite or doesn’t want

74
00:08:12,193 --> 00:08:16,503
any return – nirvaaj.

75
00:08:16,503 --> 00:08:21,902
But the conditionings are too much.

76
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:30,222
First the problem of conditioning comes to
you when you think that, “This condition

77
00:08:30,222 --> 00:08:41,893
makes me hate someone,” or, “I cannot
love someone because this is the condition!”

78
00:08:41,893 --> 00:08:52,306
But actually the conditioning itself is so
absurd, if you see it one by one.

79
00:08:52,413 --> 00:09:01,744
A conditioned mind can love in a limited way
because it is conditioned.

80
00:09:01,744 --> 00:09:12,303
Then the greatest enemy of love is ego within
us, which is like a balloon on top of our head.

81
00:09:12,304 --> 00:09:16,897
And this ego gives us a very big tension.

82
00:09:17,084 --> 00:09:21,640
We have norms about everything,
about art about every creation.

83
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,410
We don’t like this carpet.
Why?

84
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:31,690
Because it doesn’t appeal to our intellectual
understanding of the norms we have reached

85
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:36,001
and in that frame it doesn’t fit in so we
don’t like it.

86
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:42,388
Can you even create one inch of that?

87
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:46,725
So this ego gives you an unauthorised action.

88
00:09:46,725 --> 00:09:51,765
It is unauthorised, anadhikar cheshta (नधिकार
चेष्टा).

89
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:52,765
Un-authorised.

90
00:09:52,765 --> 00:09:57,035
You have no authority to criticise.

91
00:09:57,035 --> 00:10:04,465
You can’t do anything, so why should you
criticise?

92
00:10:04,465 --> 00:10:10,385
Better [to] appreciate and see for yourself
that you are not in authority, you are not

93
00:10:10,385 --> 00:10:14,684
worthy of it, to criticise.

94
00:10:14,684 --> 00:10:20,505
If you are not worthy of it why should you
criticise anything?

95
00:10:20,505 --> 00:10:29,924
And, otherwise also, you must know [that]
you are a slave of your ego.

96
00:10:29,924 --> 00:10:35,845
Whatever you ego dictates and your intelligence,
so-called ‘intelligence’, brings you to

97
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:37,704
a point, to have some norm.

98
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:43,574
And then it becomes a collective ego of a
particular community, of a particular country,

99
00:10:43,574 --> 00:10:45,745
of a particular ideology.

100
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,125
It’s collective.

101
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:56,574
So then they say, “Oh we think this is no
art!”

102
00:10:56,574 --> 00:11:04,434
That is the reason we cannot have masters
any more in art.

103
00:11:04,434 --> 00:11:08,194
We can’t have Rembrandt, we can’t.

104
00:11:08,194 --> 00:11:12,265
Poor Rembrandt must have himself suffered
a lot.

105
00:11:12,265 --> 00:11:14,834
You know Gauguin suffered a lot.

106
00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:16,955
All these artists suffered a lot.

107
00:11:16,955 --> 00:11:19,694
Even Michelangelo suffered a lot.

108
00:11:19,694 --> 00:11:26,285
Not only monetarily, not only monetarily,
but otherwise: criticise, criticise, criticise.

109
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:27,814
So I think people have given up.

110
00:11:27,814 --> 00:11:32,625
I met an artist who had done lots of art work
and I said, “Why don’t you show me?”

111
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,885
He said, “No I don’t want to show you.

112
00:11:34,885 --> 00:11:35,885
It’s created for myself."

113
00:11:35,885 --> 00:11:38,475
I said, “I would like to see!”

114
00:11:38,475 --> 00:11:43,505
I saw, it was beautiful, very beautiful, I
said, “Why don’t you show?”

115
00:11:43,505 --> 00:11:45,985
He said, “No use.
People will just criticise.

116
00:11:45,985 --> 00:11:48,235
I do it for my own pleasure.

117
00:11:48,235 --> 00:11:56,944
They’ll just spoil the whole joy of my creation."

118
00:11:56,944 --> 00:12:02,665
So one of the basic things we should avoid
is to criticise others.

119
00:12:04,571 --> 00:12:07,251
Better to criticise yourself.

120
00:12:07,332 --> 00:12:13,621
Criticise yourself, criticise your brothers
and sisters, criticise your country, criticise

121
00:12:13,702 --> 00:12:21,143
all the habits you have and laugh at yourself,
is the best way.

122
00:12:21,245 --> 00:12:29,825
If you know how to laugh at yourself then
you will not object or will not stand in the

123
00:12:29,825 --> 00:12:33,492
way of any creativity of another person.

124
00:12:34,158 --> 00:12:42,468
But you have to show complete patience and
complete understanding and you must talk like

125
00:12:42,468 --> 00:12:45,067
a person who loves.

126
00:12:45,067 --> 00:12:57,358
Love has such a power that nobody wants to
do something that will suggest that they don’t

127
00:12:57,358 --> 00:13:00,978
love; very powerful thing it is.

128
00:13:00,978 --> 00:13:07,208
It binds people in such a beautiful manner
that one wants to do something: for example

129
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:10,027
you want to give me flowers, because you know
I love flowers.

130
00:13:10,027 --> 00:13:15,168
So you want to give me flower to suggest that,
“Mother we love you,” Just to suggest.

131
00:13:15,168 --> 00:13:22,777
I know you love me but you just want to, sort
of, reinforce it, the thought in me.

132
00:13:22,777 --> 00:13:29,448
So you want to give me a flower to show your
love and expression of your inner feeling

133
00:13:29,448 --> 00:13:33,187
for me.

134
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:38,027
So all these material things can be used to
express your love.

135
00:13:38,027 --> 00:13:45,498
They can be very easily expressed in such
a manner that another person knows what is

136
00:13:45,498 --> 00:13:46,498
love.

137
00:13:46,498 --> 00:13:50,988
But the whole power of Sahastrara is love.

138
00:13:50,988 --> 00:14:04,858
So, if you see that, this brain has to love;
brain has to love.

139
00:14:04,858 --> 00:14:13,348
After now verifying the powers of Sahaja Yoga,
through your brain and intelligence, if you

140
00:14:13,348 --> 00:14:19,927
reach a point where you understand that: No,
it’s no use analysing, synthesising, doing

141
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:21,638
all these things.

142
00:14:21,638 --> 00:14:23,018
It’s just love.

143
00:14:23,018 --> 00:14:24,858
It’s simple love.

144
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:53,848
We have to open out our Sahastrara again:
through our meditative processes, through

145
00:15:53,848 --> 00:15:56,658
understanding ourselves and others.

146
00:15:56,658 --> 00:16:01,658
Maybe logically reaching that point: there’s
no way out now.

147
00:16:01,658 --> 00:16:04,408
We have reached to the end of it now.

148
00:16:04,408 --> 00:16:06,328
The whole logic has ended up now.

149
00:16:06,328 --> 00:16:10,438
Jump in the ocean of love – finished!

150
00:16:10,438 --> 00:16:15,888
Once you jump into the ocean of love there’s
nothing to be done; just to be enjoyed – every

151
00:16:15,888 --> 00:16:25,278
wave of it, every hue of it, every touch of
it.

152
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:39,049
That is what one has to learn by reasoning
that Sahaja Yoga is nothing but is love.

153
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:41,128
May God bless you all.
