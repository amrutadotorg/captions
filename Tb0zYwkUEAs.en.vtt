00:00:01.413 --> 00:00:04.075
First let Me talk in English for foreign yogis

00:00:04.258 --> 00:00:07.428
and then I shall talk in Hindi.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.720
I am sorry I was delayed.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.800
We were supposed to see the Collector and the

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.320
Tahsildar, as they call him.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.720
They have done so much for us; so much they have organized,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.840
all the way, and officially they have done so well,

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.800
that I had to wait for them to thank them very much.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.000
I think

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.720
it's not very much hot for you, see the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.760
wind is blowing, can you imagine.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.880
And if you see, there's no, no leaves, leaves are not moving.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.800
You always used to go and sit in the sun,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.520
so now here it is, you'd better have some of it.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.440
I hope you all enjoyed your stay in Jabalpur

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.240
and the visit to Jabalpur.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.320
It was quite interesting. Some people have not yet arrived.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.400
I am sorry to say they haven't been able to arrive

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.080
from Bombay.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.600
I think they are more Bombayites, not from the foreign countries,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.680
but otherwise I think all of you are here.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.320
It's a very unusual thing to happen like this, you see,

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:46.120
this My father built this house about eighty years back.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.160
He was very imaginative and fond of guests,

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.480
so he also put up guest bedrooms and guest bathrooms, such,

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.840
and it was a hill station.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.280
Now of course, because of crowdedness very cold and a hill station

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.680
so people used to come, his friends used to come from Nagpur,

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.480
so he had made arrangements for them.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.600
There were no hotels or anything so they used to have -

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.800
and the people of this place are extremely hospitable,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.440
very hospitable.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.040
So it was his idea that he should have a house here

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.840
where his guests could be.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.280
His brother had a big house

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.920
but it was joint and he couldn't receive his guests,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.400
so he thought it's better to build a house here,

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.960
and behind was a huge, big compound bigger than this,

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.280
which I have seen.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.800
I was only four years of age when we went away from here,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.360
but I remember each and everything

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.760
about this house, and everything about Chhindwara.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.400
And you know My memory is unusually, very, very sharp.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.880
I mean, I remember even My birth, it's to that extent.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.760
But I never knew that there would be so many saints coming

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.080
to visit this place of My birth.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.080
I never expected that there would be so many people

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.840
who will take to Sahaja Yoga in My lifetime,

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.000
because when I was born I found people were so blind.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.040
I thought, "How will I talk about Sahaja Yog? What will I do?

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.720
How will it work out? It's very difficult."

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.760
My father knew about My mission,

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.160
and he told Me that "You'd better find out a way

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.960
by which You can give Realization en masse.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.600
That was important, because

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.320
even if You give Realization one person, is of no use.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.080
Also You should not write anything,

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.680
because You don't create another Bible, Gita, Koran,

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.160
because books also bind them.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.720
So best thing is that You should take to...

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.640
search of human beings,

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.320
why they can't get it, their en masse Realization,

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.240
because now You have come for that purpose."

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.080
Somehow it worked it out,

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.680
and really it was surprising, I was really,

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.000
was not thinking to open Sahasrara,

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.840
but I was literally forced into it and it worked out.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.200
It's working out. You can see, all of you are here.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.560
It's very amazing thing that can happen to someone like this,

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.360
that in the lifetime only,

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.720
you have come here to see this birthplace of Mine.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.000
It was such, such vibrations

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.080
that My Sahasrara became completely jammed with vibrations.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.920
So cool inside, and outside was so hot that I didn't know

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.720
what was happening.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.720
So I'm happy all of you could come and see this place,

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.120
and a very humble house it was,

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.480
but in those days it was the most,

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.280
I mean, well-planned house as such,

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.440
and was very much appreciated by people.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.840
And after that four years I was here,

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:18.080
and then we went to Nagpur because we had a,

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.160
My father had a big practice in Nagpur,

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.240
he had to go many times down,

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.400
so they thought it's better to go.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.840
There also he had many houses,

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.200
and Babamama is going to take you round to see those houses.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.120
He says he'll find out time to see wherever I have lived.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.040
But Nagpur also is very vibrated place, you can feel it.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.600
People are very quiet, it's a very quiet place.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.440
So this is a very novel thing,

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.160
I don't think it has happened in the lifetime of

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.000
any one of the incarnations who came on this earth.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.040
Even for Rama Janma Bhoomi we are fighting even today.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.559
So you can imagine.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.200
Thank God, we have got this place - in a way. It's not yet ours,

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.000
but in a way we are there,

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:12.000
and maybe with your good wishes we'll own it very soon.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.520
Today's puja I thought was best to have

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.680
Shri Ganesha Puja in a short way,

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.480
because the first Puja here, and I was born here,

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.480
so it's better that we should have a Ganesha Puja.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.520
It would be a nice thing to start with,

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.880
and I, we have a doctor here.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.760
They are all Sahaja Yogis and they are going to help us

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.920
to do the curing. Actually I always thought,

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.760
"Which is the place where people will get cured?"

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.400
So now we'll send all of them here to get cured.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.280
It's a, it was a jungle here.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.800
All around was jungles, hills,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.560
but I think all that's finished and broken now.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.280
And we used to get tigers and things;

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.120
little far away from here is a place called Tamiya

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.000
where they could go see tigers,

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.400
but now they are there no doubt,

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.360
but they are saying that nobody is now going that side,

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.320
they all go to some preserve places

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.120
which you have seen yourself, also Kanha Kisli.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.080
I hope you enjoyed. How did you enjoy Kanha Kisli?

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.720
And the River Narmada also I was told you enjoyed very much.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.160
I am happy this has happened.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.960
It was a little circuitous and quite

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.200
different from all the tours we have had so far,

00:07:43.559 --> 00:07:47.360
but I am happy you all have enjoyed it.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.440
I have said so many things about Shri Ganesh,

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.080
I don't know what to say now, anymore,

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.160
but all of you have seen that, a place, now see the -

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.240
this breeze is coming from where? I don't know.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.840
You are sending breeze to Me, instead of I doing it.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.560
All right.

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.508
All the people who live here

00:08:22.709 --> 00:08:28.727
and the Indians who have come from outside -

00:08:28.928 --> 00:08:34.557
it is a great joy for Me that in My lifetime,

00:08:34.758 --> 00:08:38.915
this birthplace of Mine is being given so much importance

00:08:39.116 --> 00:08:43.505
and that people from 60 countries have come here.

00:08:43.706 --> 00:08:45.931
Now, this Chhindwara of yours,

00:08:46.132 --> 00:08:50.294
is going to become a pilgrimage site (Kshetra Sthan),

00:08:50.508 --> 00:08:55.554
and many more people will come here to visit, and to stay here.

00:09:01.042 --> 00:09:02.994
And these are all saints now.

00:09:03.177 --> 00:09:06.209
They have become saints, and their life is saintly,

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:09.775
they can live anywhere, they can sleep anywhere.

00:09:09.976 --> 00:09:12.335
In their homes they live in luxury,

00:09:12.536 --> 00:09:14.759
but they have no demands here.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.457
They are happy in any situation.

00:09:17.658 --> 00:09:21.709
In the same way lot of other yogis have come

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:27.833
from different parts of India, from Madras,

00:09:28.034 --> 00:09:32.363
and also from Hyderabad.

00:09:32.564 --> 00:09:36.170
Vishakapatnam is so far away, but from there also they have come.

00:09:36.371 --> 00:09:39.112
They have come from Mumbai, from Pune

00:09:39.311 --> 00:09:41.740
and many have come from Delhi.

00:09:41.941 --> 00:09:47.922
And they have come from Lucknow, Punjab and from everywhere.

00:09:48.123 --> 00:09:52.560
Like this, people have come from many corners of our country also,

00:09:52.761 --> 00:09:55.451
and they are all here to attend the Puja.

00:09:55.652 --> 00:09:57.614
It is a very good thing

00:09:57.815 --> 00:10:01.572
if all the people of this country get united in this devotion.

00:10:01.773 --> 00:10:04.527
There is a lot of fighting and conflict going on here

00:10:04.728 --> 00:10:07.034
and we will get rid of it.

00:10:07.434 --> 00:10:09.021
And this should happen.

00:10:09.222 --> 00:10:13.416
When you recognize your inner dharma,

00:10:13.617 --> 00:10:17.538
then you realize that you all are one.

00:10:18.101 --> 00:10:20.926
We have no Math (saint's hermitage),

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:27.225
or we don't have big establishments like all these other gurus have.

00:10:27.426 --> 00:10:29.915
We do not have membership also.

00:10:30.116 --> 00:10:34.178
Nor do we have any institutions or organisation, nothing.

00:10:34.379 --> 00:10:37.080
Everything happens by itself in a very simple way.

00:10:37.281 --> 00:10:39.673
In this whole country,

00:10:39.874 --> 00:10:43.102
if we could reach a state where everybody becomes a saint,

00:10:43.301 --> 00:10:45.748
then there will be no problem of any kind.

00:10:45.956 --> 00:10:48.237
All the problems of our country will disappear.

00:10:48.453 --> 00:10:50.450
The problem of poverty ended for Sahaja Yogis;

00:10:50.651 --> 00:10:57.018
also their mental, physical and all other problems got cured.

00:10:57.186 --> 00:11:00.508
And they are endowed with so many blessings,

00:11:00.709 --> 00:11:02.917
that they are wondering how did all these happen.

00:11:03.118 --> 00:11:04.504
There is nothing special

00:11:04.705 --> 00:11:07.782
because the time has come that this happens to everyone.

00:11:07.983 --> 00:11:10.373
It will happen in Chhindwara and every other place.

00:11:10.574 --> 00:11:13.698
And everybody should get the benefit of it.

00:11:13.899 --> 00:11:16.333
We have started a center here.

00:11:16.517 --> 00:11:19.969
The people of Chhindwara should definitely come to this center,

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:26.235
and become a part of the collectivity.

00:11:26.444 --> 00:11:30.248
So it is not difficult for them to get their Self Realization.

00:11:30.449 --> 00:11:32.727
It can happen in an instant.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.563
Whatever Kabir said, whatever Nanaka and Jesus said,

00:11:36.764 --> 00:11:40.050
whatever Mohammad said, the thing is the time has come

00:11:40.233 --> 00:11:42.651
to take the benefit of it.

00:11:42.852 --> 00:11:45.002
Especially, since My birthplace is here

00:11:45.203 --> 00:11:50.787
it is important to tell you that I see vibrations everywhere.

00:11:50.988 --> 00:11:53.676
The whole sky is covered with chaitanya.

00:11:53.877 --> 00:11:59.391
Try to understand this thing and achieve it! It is for everyone.

00:11:59.592 --> 00:12:02.283
There is no consideration of birth, caste or creed.

00:12:02.434 --> 00:12:06.924
Everyone is entitled to receive the joy of this blessing.

00:12:07.125 --> 00:12:10.341
My blessings to all of you.
