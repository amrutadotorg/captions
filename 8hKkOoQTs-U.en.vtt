[CLAPPING]

00:04:18.587 --> 00:04:21.847
We said on our National television to day that

00:04:22.287 --> 00:04:25.107
sahaja yoga is a respectable yoga

00:04:26.387 --> 00:04:30.847
because of some so called yogas that have gone before.

00:04:31.567 --> 00:04:34.547
Shri Mataji has come to

00:04:37.687 --> 00:04:43.607
show us the truth because that's what we all desire for.

00:04:44.247 --> 00:04:48.167
That we have a special reason for existence -

00:04:50.007 --> 00:04:53.087
- it is to find the truth.

00:04:54.007 --> 00:04:59.567
And those of us who have been blessed to be with Her

00:05:00.807 --> 00:05:05.827
have found the truth. So She's come to Sydney

00:05:07.767 --> 00:05:10.827
to tell us about the truth.

00:05:12.487 --> 00:05:17.887
In a very troubled world, has arrived with

00:05:18.247 --> 00:05:24.947
many other wrong answers to our troubles - the answers of drugs, hard and soft

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:31.767
and other things that distract us - we found that those are not the answer.

00:05:34.347 --> 00:05:39.547
Holy Mother thank You for coming and thank You for being with us.

00:05:41.567 --> 00:05:47.207
So, once again, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:06:00.827 --> 00:06:05.267
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:06:07.627 --> 00:06:11.627
The idea about truth

00:06:12.287 --> 00:06:16.967
is sometimes a misconception.

00:06:18.567 --> 00:06:24.867
Truth is what it is and will be the truth.

00:06:25.687 --> 00:06:31.387
We cannot change it, we cannot organize it,

00:06:31.747 --> 00:06:36.687
we cannot work it out - it remains what it is.

00:06:37.567 --> 00:06:43.847
And the greatest truth is that we all have become human beings

00:06:44.567 --> 00:06:50.187
to become the spirit. We're still

00:06:52.347 --> 00:06:58.987
not in that stage that's why there are problems around us.

00:07:00.427 --> 00:07:05.547
Once you become the truth, it being the Absolute,

00:07:05.787 --> 00:07:11.127
you reach the state of Absoluteness. Then there is

00:07:12.007 --> 00:07:16.927
no difference of ideologies,

00:07:18.907 --> 00:07:22.967
no differences of nation -

00:07:23.967 --> 00:07:29.607
- all nations one knows are created by God Almighty.

00:07:30.907 --> 00:07:38.847
Just He created variety to give a beautiful world to us.

00:07:40.747 --> 00:07:45.987
Variety always gives beauty.

00:07:46.547 --> 00:07:52.707
That's why this variety was created just to make the world very interesting

00:07:53.027 --> 00:07:58.407
but not for fighting or for quarreling or for believing

00:07:58.667 --> 00:08:04.107
that this part belongs to us and that part belongs to somebody else.

00:08:12.827 --> 00:08:20.847
The human problem, as I have studied, is very simple -

00:08:22.687 --> 00:08:29.147
- is to be understood in a detached way.

00:08:30.747 --> 00:08:38.887
Now here you can see the beautiful machinery that is working within ourselves.

00:08:39.967 --> 00:08:47.487
If you see on the left-hand side we have [ASIDE - SOMEBODY SHOULD COME AND SHOW] blue colored line

00:08:48.467 --> 00:08:53.347
and the right-hand side you see a yellow line.

00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:58.907
In the center you see a white channel

00:09:03.107 --> 00:09:10.667
These are our Autonomous Nervous Systems - three channels -

00:09:10.927 --> 00:09:15.087
Left and Right Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Nervous System.

00:09:15.647 --> 00:09:22.347
When I talk of Medical Science people get quite surprised.

00:09:22.947 --> 00:09:29.367
But it has something to do to understand what are we inside ourselves.

00:09:30.007 --> 00:09:35.707
Now this Parasympathetic Nervous System is a system that gives us balance.

00:09:37.107 --> 00:09:43.367
For example, if I'm running fast, My heart will start thumping

00:09:43.687 --> 00:09:47.407
but it comes to normal through Parasympathetic Nervous System.

00:09:47.667 --> 00:09:54.647
And Medical Science doesn't know much about the Parasympathetic Nervous System which is actually in the center.

00:09:55.787 --> 00:10:01.327
These chakras are around the Parasympathetic Nervous System and

00:10:03.727 --> 00:10:11.667
like My fingers here, this is the chakra in the center here

00:10:11.907 --> 00:10:19.087
and this the Left Sympathetic and this the Right Sympathetic and they both put together make this center

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:23.147
to form the Parasympathetic - simple as that.

00:10:24.387 --> 00:10:32.347
Now what happens with human-beings, that they have a capacity, they have a freedom also

00:10:33.047 --> 00:10:40.287
to go to the left or to the right. They can be very emotional people.

00:10:40.647 --> 00:10:46.827
They can go to the emotional side to such an extent that they can become fanatics.

00:10:50.007 --> 00:10:54.687
They can go further with it so that

00:10:55.947 --> 00:11:03.487
the left side which represents our Subconscious,

00:11:05.007 --> 00:11:09.927
then the Collective Subconscious can be entered into.

00:11:10.707 --> 00:11:14.707
So they can enter into Collective Subconscious also.

00:11:17.107 --> 00:11:23.427
Subconscious also has 3 - 4 layers that is we can say the Present Subconscious,

00:11:23.827 --> 00:11:27.847
the Past Subconscious and the Subconscious of ages.

00:11:28.607 --> 00:11:34.707
Then the Collective Subconscious where all that is dead exists in that area.

00:11:36.487 --> 00:11:43.647
Now, when you move too much on that side, you get attacked by that side

00:11:44.587 --> 00:11:52.547
and that side has got all that is dead which attacks you, which triggers you.

00:11:56.607 --> 00:12:04.227
On the right hand side we have got another channel of the Right Sympathetic Nervous System.

00:12:06.247 --> 00:12:13.967
This channel represents our activity and our future.

00:12:15.687 --> 00:12:23.647
So when you're overactive, you're working very hard, you're futuristic - all the time thinking about the future

00:12:24.767 --> 00:12:28.127
- you start moving towards the right side

00:12:29.047 --> 00:12:37.187
to such an extent that you can enter into your Collective Supra-conscious also.

00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:44.307
In the same way you have got your Present Supra-conscious and also Collective Supra-conscious.

00:12:47.347 --> 00:12:54.007
Now, human beings have a capacity, that they can move to the left and to the right with their attention.

00:12:54.247 --> 00:13:01.467
They can project their attention to the left or to their right or they can be moderate in the center.

00:13:03.327 --> 00:13:10.567
So, when people talked of religion - I mean the real people who came on this earth, they talked of religion -

00:13:10.987 --> 00:13:18.727
they talked about our valency, that's a human valency is of ten number -

00:13:18.967 --> 00:13:25.507
and that's why they talked of ten commandments. Or in every religion they talked about it

00:13:25.767 --> 00:13:31.447
that we have to keep this balance. When we go out of this balance

00:13:31.647 --> 00:13:35.027
then we either move to the left or to the right.

00:13:36.407 --> 00:13:41.487
But, if you see the history of religions, it is just the opposite.

00:13:43.047 --> 00:13:47.887
That all these religions have created conditionings within us -

00:13:49.027 --> 00:13:53.447
a kind of a fanatism, a kind of a blind faith

00:13:54.947 --> 00:13:59.607
which was never the purpose of establishing your

00:14:00.087 --> 00:14:03.707
valencies within yourself.

00:14:06.107 --> 00:14:13.107
The movement to the right is also another problem of the modern times.

00:14:13.927 --> 00:14:20.307
When we move to the right, we actually start becoming very egoistical.

00:14:22.067 --> 00:14:28.467
The activity that we form, the activity that we perform

00:14:29.887 --> 00:14:35.887
creates a balloon like structure on our head, as you see, crossing over here,

00:14:36.867 --> 00:14:40.727
as ego - that yellow stuff.

00:14:43.227 --> 00:14:51.387
On the left hand side when we're conditioned very much, we get another balloon, which we call as super-ego.

00:14:57.467 --> 00:15:03.227
Jung also, missed the point because he described

00:15:03.447 --> 00:15:09.067
that there're layers horizontally placed within ourselves - it is not so.

00:15:10.187 --> 00:15:16.007
God, is a great constructor and a manager.

00:15:16.287 --> 00:15:23.967
For example, you have put a road for Me here - I don't have to pass through different, different rows.

00:15:24.827 --> 00:15:31.247
In the same way He placed everything in a vertical way

00:15:31.647 --> 00:15:36.287
and the road to realization is kept free within us.

00:15:37.887 --> 00:15:41.887
The road to realization is straightforward, which you see,

00:15:42.167 --> 00:15:47.007
is the shown in the white color, is the Parasympathetic Nervous System.

00:15:50.067 --> 00:15:55.667
Now those people who move to the left or to the right, develop diseases.

00:15:56.427 --> 00:16:02.287
For example, I'll show you here, now supposing, I move one finger too much here

00:16:02.567 --> 00:16:05.927
then I'm cut off, cut off with the main -

00:16:07.607 --> 00:16:14.947
this side is cut off with the main, this side is cut off with the main. Then what happens that there is no control

00:16:17.007 --> 00:16:23.867
and the cells become malignant, on their own. They start over-powering others

00:16:24.207 --> 00:16:29.707
and that's how they start destroying other cells - we say cancer has been established.

00:16:33.047 --> 00:16:39.287
Is a very simple thing, is to bring them back again and put them in contact

00:16:40.347 --> 00:16:43.887
with the Divine and bring them to the mains.

00:16:46.507 --> 00:16:53.507
Secondly, people have these days diseases like Diabetes - very common, Diabetes is a very common disease.

00:16:54.587 --> 00:16:59.847
Now in Indian villages, the villagers when they take tea

00:17:00.427 --> 00:17:07.467
they say, the we must take so much sugar that the spoon must stand in the sugar.

00:17:07.847 --> 00:17:14.027
And they drink such a lot of sugar - they never have Diabetes, never - they have never known Diabetes.

00:17:18.127 --> 00:17:22.147
What is the cause of Diabetes or liver trouble

00:17:22.487 --> 00:17:27.007
or we can say, other troubles like Blood Cancer?

00:17:27.567 --> 00:17:33.307
Is a very simple thing that we do - is the imbalance within us.

00:17:34.807 --> 00:17:39.507
Is you see, the yellow center we call as Swadhisthana,

00:17:40.267 --> 00:17:45.787
which looks after the Aortic plexus in our body, on the physical level,

00:17:46.327 --> 00:17:50.267
this center has a very special work to do

00:17:51.567 --> 00:17:57.207
that is to convert the fat cells for the use of the brain.

00:17:57.967 --> 00:18:01.607
So it converts the fat cells for the use of the brain.

00:18:02.787 --> 00:18:10.387
If people are very futuristic - all the time thinking, thinking, thinking - then this poor

00:18:12.667 --> 00:18:19.247
center or chakra has one work, is to convert cells after cells for the use of the brain.

00:18:19.607 --> 00:18:24.667
Brain starts growing but what about the other function it has to do?

00:18:25.027 --> 00:18:31.687
It has to look after the liver, it has to look after the pancreas,

00:18:32.187 --> 00:18:39.767
it has to look after the spleen, it has to look after part of the intestines and also the kidneys.

00:18:41.987 --> 00:18:47.427
When we start thinking too much, we give too much work to this one center

00:18:48.467 --> 00:18:54.427
all these visceras are neglected and you may develop any one of these troubles.

00:18:55.207 --> 00:18:58.327
But when it comes to spleen, it is even worse.

00:18:59.947 --> 00:19:06.127
When it comes to spleen - these days the life is so hectic - first of all,

00:19:06.487 --> 00:19:13.027
we get up in the morning, first thing we do is to read the newspaper - that's the horrid thing to do.

00:19:14.247 --> 00:19:19.127
Coming out of very nice sleep, you suddenly read the newspaper and so many are bombed,

00:19:19.347 --> 00:19:22.867
so many are killed and so many are harassed - Oh God!

00:19:23.947 --> 00:19:27.127
You get a shock, the system gets a shock.

00:19:29.287 --> 00:19:33.067
Now, when the system gets a shock, the spleen has to

00:19:33.567 --> 00:19:37.967
produce more Red blood corpuscles - it has to work very hard.

00:19:38.307 --> 00:19:44.367
Then you suddenly discover, you have to go to your work, so you get out of your bed and rush here and there,

00:19:44.627 --> 00:19:51.567
brush your teeth on your way and carry your breakfast - maybe your wife is running after you with the breakfast - you have no time for anything.

00:19:51.807 --> 00:19:55.867
Such a hectic life you lead - extremely hectic.

00:19:56.187 --> 00:20:00.027
Then you get into the car, you find there's a jam - finished.

00:20:00.327 --> 00:20:04.827
Is a, we don't understand how much you're shocking ourselves all the time.

00:20:05.127 --> 00:20:09.647
We are on a war path with the watch.

00:20:10.967 --> 00:20:14.907
All the time struggling for time, struggling for time.

00:20:15.867 --> 00:20:20.687
This spleen doesn't understand the person -

00:20:22.247 --> 00:20:26.087
there's no rhythm in the life of that person.

00:20:27.047 --> 00:20:35.027
The spleen thinks, what am I to do now? Suddenly this person needs the Red blood corpuscles, then it doesn't need, then suddenly it needs it - it becomes hectic.

00:20:37.327 --> 00:20:44.887
It needs hec.. when it becomes hectic, it becomes vulnerable for Blood Cancer.

00:20:45.567 --> 00:20:53.507
And then, if a person gets any shock or goes to the left side in an emotional way, he gets Blood Cancer.

00:20:54.387 --> 00:21:01.187
Even the mothers who are like this, very hectic, disciplining their children, "Keep the carpet clean,

00:21:01.647 --> 00:21:07.447
eh..walk this way, first put your right foot then left foot, don't walk that way" -

00:21:09.707 --> 00:21:14.767
the child, when she's pregnant, can get Blood Cancer.

00:21:19.667 --> 00:21:26.007
We must understand we are delicately made beautiful flowers of God, we're human beings

00:21:27.307 --> 00:21:31.547
and the time has come for us to become now the fruits.

00:21:32.007 --> 00:21:38.567
This is the blossom time. But we shock our system with so many things - for what have we achieved?

00:21:41.887 --> 00:21:48.807
In India we have Taj Mahal, we have Ajanta caves, we have so many things to show you

00:21:49.087 --> 00:21:56.587
but they are all in the past. I don't think in Sydney you can make a hall like this anymore - is not possible.

00:21:58.527 --> 00:22:01.687
What have we achieved - plastics?

00:22:04.287 --> 00:22:07.307
What are we achieving?

00:22:09.047 --> 00:22:16.307
The modern times we have lost the sense of greatness and glorious things.

00:22:18.307 --> 00:22:23.747
All the time you're struggling with time and no body has time.

00:22:25.267 --> 00:22:32.647
Everybody is rushing up. I asked one gentleman, "Why're you in such a hurry to go to London, after all,

00:22:32.987 --> 00:22:37.187
it's all right you can go tomorrow, if you don't get the seat today you can go tomorrow?"

00:22:37.347 --> 00:22:40.327
He said, "No, I have to attend a ball."

00:22:41.087 --> 00:22:45.887
He'll waste 3 hours in the ball or in a pub, that's all right.

00:22:46.707 --> 00:22:54.007
But, he's so worried about getting his ticket - for that he will completely rattle his system.

00:22:56.707 --> 00:23:00.147
Just to get the ticket and that for what?

00:23:00.427 --> 00:23:05.727
That ball is not going to give him any relaxation because he's already finished his system.

00:23:06.027 --> 00:23:10.527
That's how one develops this Blood Cancer.

00:23:14.147 --> 00:23:20.267
Then the pancreas is out of order, one develops Diabetes

00:23:20.887 --> 00:23:24.127
Kidneys are out of order - high blood pressure.

00:23:24.667 --> 00:23:30.207
Then all kinds of kidney troubles and then they go on the machine and all kinds of things happen.

00:23:36.267 --> 00:23:41.947
It is happening in all the nonsensical things also we have taken.

00:23:42.687 --> 00:23:48.487
Like for us now, so far he was, Mr. Freud was

00:23:48.887 --> 00:23:54.647
had displaced Christ completely. He had become Christ for us.

00:23:56.227 --> 00:24:02.107
Blind-folded we followed him and also out-witted him

00:24:02.567 --> 00:24:07.487
in our projections. "What's wrong?"

00:24:09.927 --> 00:24:14.107
When I went to America in '73

00:24:14.767 --> 00:24:21.087
I told them that this is all wrong you're doing, it will have a very bad effect, it's not natural.

00:24:22.007 --> 00:24:26.587
If promiscuousness is good, then why does it give diseases?

00:24:26.847 --> 00:24:33.947
If it is natural, then why does it give you problems - simple question?

00:24:38.467 --> 00:24:44.987
There's a kind of a ego that we can do it - but why fight with the nature?

00:24:48.627 --> 00:24:53.267
If you fight with the nature, nature will take it's respite.

00:24:54.767 --> 00:25:02.007
And today that's why, we have to say, "This was wrong we have done and we're not going to do it anymore."

00:25:02.647 --> 00:25:05.647
Our children are not going to do it.

00:25:08.847 --> 00:25:15.087
After going through all the experiences now they're talking that cigarette should be abandoned.

00:25:17.367 --> 00:25:24.367
But Nanak Sahab had told long time back that cigarette is the worst thing, it will cause horrible trouble to you.

00:25:26.647 --> 00:25:31.227
Now they're saying about no smoking - now they cannot give up.

00:25:33.487 --> 00:25:40.687
There are thousand and one problems - the greatest is, I think now, is AIDS -

00:25:42.187 --> 00:25:46.387
is caused by nothing but stupid ego.

00:25:51.267 --> 00:25:58.267
Anything they try, you ask them why do you do it ; like some people are now coloring their heads.

00:25:58.747 --> 00:26:05.747
And I found some of them are becoming blind. So I said, "Why are you doing it?" They said, "What's wrong?"

00:26:07.667 --> 00:26:12.947
But why do you want to color your hair? "But what's wrong?" I didn't know what to answer.

00:26:13.227 --> 00:26:20.487
I said, "But it will make you blind." "We'll see when it makes us blind." - Such arrogance!

00:26:22.887 --> 00:26:30.467
You can't challenge your system like that, you have to be humble about it because it's a delicate system of a human being.

00:26:31.307 --> 00:26:38.267
We are not hippopotamus, are we? That on a hippopotamus you paint anything, nothing will happen to him.

00:26:38.607 --> 00:26:45.327
But we're human beings, we have got cells here, which absorb paints and that can go on to our nerves,

00:26:45.567 --> 00:26:49.127
can also go on to our other centers.

00:26:52.567 --> 00:26:58.427
There should be a basic understanding - what is ridiculous?

00:27:05.487 --> 00:27:12.907
As if, people have gone a muck and doing all these things - but that's what, you're going to the left or to the right.

00:27:14.327 --> 00:27:20.807
Now, those people who move too much to the right, get heart attacks.

00:27:23.047 --> 00:27:30.187
They maybe thin like dried fishes but they can get heart attacks.

00:27:32.427 --> 00:27:38.847
When you extract too much of your energy on the right side, the heart gives in.

00:27:44.347 --> 00:27:50.247
There is no need to put in so much effort

00:27:52.347 --> 00:27:56.847
- like one day I met a lady who had a heart attack -

00:27:57.707 --> 00:28:01.607
she's just a housewife with only two children.

00:28:04.087 --> 00:28:10.227
I said, "Why do you get a heart attack, madam?" She said, "I've to work very hard, You know."

00:28:11.327 --> 00:28:18.127
"With two children what do you do?" "Oh, I've to keep everything clean, absolutely clean,

00:28:18.367 --> 00:28:24.327
to keep my children clean, I've to keep my husband clean, I've to keep my bathroom clean, to keep," and I said,

00:28:24.727 --> 00:28:31.727
"It's all right, but why don't you understand that also your health is there and you should take some rest in between."

00:28:32.027 --> 00:28:36.827
"No, to me cleanliness is everything." Then you have the heart attack.

00:28:39.167 --> 00:28:43.867
This is the norms of today's life.

00:28:44.507 --> 00:28:49.227
I don't think our parents used to polish everything all the time

00:28:49.567 --> 00:28:55.367
or they were all the time with a vacuum cleaner, you see, like a tail we have a vacuum cleaner with us.

00:28:56.267 --> 00:29:02.707
Doesn't matter, it's house. After all, it should be a cozy place for children

00:29:03.027 --> 00:29:08.187
and for the husband to come down. Doesn't matter, once you clean it, it's all right.

00:29:08.727 --> 00:29:13.467
But that kind of a attitude we cannot take because that's the norm.

00:29:16.547 --> 00:29:21.787
So many norms we have which are really absurd and ridiculous.

00:29:22.427 --> 00:29:26.427
We can never sit down and enjoy each other's company.

00:29:26.887 --> 00:29:34.567
If the husband and wife are sitting, there should be a television in between or some sort of a drama or something.

00:29:36.047 --> 00:29:42.447
There should be something in between, they cannot talk to each other - there's no relaxing mood.

00:29:42.667 --> 00:29:46.267
There's so much to be talked between husband and wife.

00:29:46.507 --> 00:29:53.067
I mean, when husband wife are enjoying themselves and talking to each other, it's better to switch off the horrible

00:29:53.387 --> 00:29:58.127
television which is showing the quarrel between husband and wife all the time.

00:30:03.187 --> 00:30:11.087
So, all these things work out - the family system, the household and the all the norms we have started.

00:30:11.767 --> 00:30:17.467
All these things work out on our sweet beautiful system that we have.

00:30:19.327 --> 00:30:23.347
We are fighting all the time with each other, for what?

00:30:24.327 --> 00:30:32.507
This is what takes us to the extremes and these extremes are responsible for giving us all these problems.

00:30:36.787 --> 00:30:42.367
Now, with the Kundalini awakening, when She rises, passes through those centers -

00:30:42.627 --> 00:30:47.447
first of all She puts them like a slot, they all come back,

00:30:48.867 --> 00:30:55.107
fall in lines, She awakens them, gives them energy, the energy flows out

00:30:55.447 --> 00:30:58.967
cures cancer, cures this, cures that, cures that.

00:31:00.587 --> 00:31:06.207
Then it passes through your Agnya chakra here, where you forgive everyone.

00:31:09.147 --> 00:31:15.847
You just forgive. You don't know, what a weapon Christ has given us to forgive.

00:31:16.807 --> 00:31:21.127
Half of the marriages would be all right if we know how to forgive.

00:31:23.267 --> 00:31:29.787
Just makes you a sweet, beautiful, charming person

00:31:30.147 --> 00:31:35.167
in the real sense of the word, not outwardly because you're dressed up well or you have

00:31:35.447 --> 00:31:43.047
a beautiful ornament or something like that. You really become a very charming person in the sense

00:31:43.247 --> 00:31:50.667
that you charm the children, you charm your family, you charm the whole world.

00:31:52.627 --> 00:31:59.287
Because once you start forgiving, the love of your heart starts pouring everywhere.

00:32:01.587 --> 00:32:09.567
When She opens this last center, actually here on the fontanel bone area, where you get your real baptism

00:32:10.747 --> 00:32:16.567
this is the, we call the seat of the heart center, seat of the heart center.

00:32:18.447 --> 00:32:21.927
When She opens the transformation starts

00:32:24.367 --> 00:32:30.927
and you start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. So, the transformation in the temperament,

00:32:32.447 --> 00:32:37.947
in the behavior of a person - you immediately notice the face changing -

00:32:38.227 --> 00:32:45.167
the tense face that you see suddenly becomes mellowed down - we're relaxed.

00:32:46.047 --> 00:32:53.547
And this Kundalini awakening then kept up well, makes you grow spiritually.

00:32:54.767 --> 00:33:00.287
And the spiritual growth in a person is what we want today.

00:33:00.927 --> 00:33:09.407
Of course, no diseases, no physical problems, no mental problems -

00:33:11.507 --> 00:33:16.827
many mad people have been cured, this Schizophrenia has been cured with sahaja yoga.

00:33:17.607 --> 00:33:24.107
Is all because our spirit has not come into our attention.

00:33:25.267 --> 00:33:30.767
Spirit is the light but the light we see here is jarring sometimes -

00:33:31.127 --> 00:33:35.867
has nothing in it - the light of the spirit has love -

00:33:37.647 --> 00:33:45.447
is beautiful love about which we have heard about, which is All Pervading, is all over

00:33:45.987 --> 00:33:53.007
and you just feel absolutely sure of yourself as if you're entered

00:33:53.667 --> 00:33:59.387
into the beautiful hall of God's kingdom where you're secured, you're respected,

00:33:59.707 --> 00:34:03.247
you're loved, you're looked after - is a fact.

00:34:05.347 --> 00:34:09.907
But we have to enter there and we have to receive that blessing.

00:34:11.427 --> 00:34:16.107
Then this physical things look nothing, insignificant.

00:34:16.347 --> 00:34:20.987
If somebody has some problem you can go and cure it, I need not be there.

00:34:22.527 --> 00:34:27.507
You can raise the Kundalini of other people. This is your birthright

00:34:28.047 --> 00:34:33.027
to get the Kundalini awakened and to have your real baptism.

00:34:35.607 --> 00:34:41.527
You have got it within yourself, all is your power - I'm doing nothing,

00:34:41.867 --> 00:34:48.547
maybe a catalyst - for a little while and then you become the catalyst.

00:34:51.307 --> 00:34:55.667
The whole world can change and transform itself

00:34:56.447 --> 00:35:01.807
if it follows the power of love. We have never used the power of love -

00:35:02.007 --> 00:35:05.447
is all the power of hatred all the time.

00:35:05.747 --> 00:35:11.707
But the power of love that is Divine love is devoid of lust and greed -

00:35:12.387 --> 00:35:15.607
is just you enjoy the loving of love.

00:35:18.507 --> 00:35:25.127
And that situation when it works, you see the whole world in a different way

00:35:25.567 --> 00:35:30.167
and you develop that witness state which is described many a times by many saints

00:35:30.367 --> 00:35:33.387
and many prophets and Incarnations.

00:35:34.587 --> 00:35:41.507
It's a very easy thing to happen, it is spontaneous because it's the living force,

00:35:42.047 --> 00:35:50.087
is the living thing - you cannot pay for it, it's ridiculous to think that you can pay for it - you cannot.

00:35:52.727 --> 00:36:00.627
How much money did we pay to the plants which produce these beautiful flowers - nothing.

00:36:00.987 --> 00:36:04.927
They just gave you the flowers because they enjoy giving.

00:36:07.787 --> 00:36:15.007
That sort of personalities we all become - beautiful people. Actually we have wasted our life quite a lot.

00:36:16.247 --> 00:36:22.307
After realization we understand how valuable we are, how glorified we are,

00:36:22.887 --> 00:36:29.987
how God loves us and how He looks after us moment to moment!

00:36:33.107 --> 00:36:40.407
These imbalances within us have now increased more by time

00:36:41.967 --> 00:36:49.487
because the ego increased a lot and then we said, "Why not do this, why not try this, why not try that,"

00:36:49.787 --> 00:36:57.407
like everybody going a muck trying this, trying that, trying that. Everything new they should have,

00:37:01.027 --> 00:37:08.027
they did not believe in what people told them before, they discarded all that and they said, "Let's try everything new."

00:37:08.807 --> 00:37:14.167
Like, the other day we were having a banquet and there was an ambassador sitting next to Me

00:37:14.447 --> 00:37:19.707
and he said, "I know, You don't like Freud." Oh, I said, " I don't like him at all."

00:37:20.867 --> 00:37:26.147
But he said, "He told us something new, while Hume didn't tell us something new, You see."

00:37:26.587 --> 00:37:32.767
I said, "All right, we've had dinner many a times but we have never eaten the table, let's have it."

00:37:33.247 --> 00:37:39.607
[LAUGHTER] That's a new thing, why not? He was shocked at Me.

00:37:42.707 --> 00:37:47.147
He said, " Everything new can be very dangerous."

00:37:48.947 --> 00:37:52.967
Let us try with the snakes, let us try with the tigers.

00:37:57.167 --> 00:38:04.447
This is the trouble with us. We have to humble down to understand that no, this

00:38:04.667 --> 00:38:11.827
is a trust of God within us - this body of ours - we have no business to insult it,

00:38:13.227 --> 00:38:20.587
to be disrespectful to it, to waste it - we have to respect it.

00:38:23.647 --> 00:38:31.507
With what difficulty it was made, the whole, you see, beautiful mechanism that is made within us

00:38:32.387 --> 00:38:36.287
and it works so spontaneously, so beautifully -

00:38:38.147 --> 00:38:42.147
even whatever you have done to it, doesn't matter, forget it -

00:38:43.587 --> 00:38:47.827
even if you have not respected it, forget it.

00:38:48.367 --> 00:38:54.967
Please don't develop any guilt - that's another disease of the modern times - everybody is guilty.

00:38:57.167 --> 00:39:02.767
Why are you guilty? You're human beings, if you have done mistakes so it's all right.

00:39:04.107 --> 00:39:09.807
It's for God to correct it - that's His job, so give Him to do that job.

00:39:10.127 --> 00:39:13.167
But we shouldn't go on doing the mistakes.

00:39:14.067 --> 00:39:18.747
Once we're blessed by Him, let us enjoy.

00:39:19.787 --> 00:39:25.627
Now many scientists say that there is no God - I think it's very unscientific to say that.

00:39:27.407 --> 00:39:30.447
A scientist must have an open mind.

00:39:31.847 --> 00:39:35.767
If he doesn't have an open mind, he's not a scientist at all.

00:39:36.027 --> 00:39:39.667
He has not known anything about God, how does he say there's no God.

00:39:42.787 --> 00:39:47.467
You may say that the way religion is followed, is wrong - I agree there.

00:39:48.127 --> 00:39:54.567
The way they make money in the name of God, is wrong - I agree there - but there is God.

00:39:57.767 --> 00:40:05.807
Definitely there is God - keep your minds open like a scientist and also,

00:40:08.747 --> 00:40:15.447
what I say is a hypothesis to you - tomorrow it will become a law and you'll be amazed

00:40:15.747 --> 00:40:22.267
the laws of God's love are so definite,

00:40:23.047 --> 00:40:30.967
unchangeable, they work so beautifully. For example, when you get your realization

00:40:32.407 --> 00:40:37.507
you feel the cool breeze on top of your head and you feel the cool breeze all around your fingers.

00:40:39.767 --> 00:40:46.587
These fingers tell you - one, two, three, four, five, six and seven -

00:40:46.947 --> 00:40:50.827
seven centers that are within you - which one is catching.

00:40:54.567 --> 00:41:01.087
Is said so - Mohammad Sahab has said, "Your hands will tell you,

00:41:01.447 --> 00:41:06.027
they will speak at the time of your resurrection."

00:41:07.187 --> 00:41:14.667
Your fingers tell you what's wrong with you, they will tell you what's wrong with another person.

00:41:16.767 --> 00:41:24.787
And that's absolute - all those who're realized will say the same thing.

00:41:28.707 --> 00:41:35.447
What's wrong with this country, what's wrong with that country, and you can verify it.

00:41:39.427 --> 00:41:43.947
It's very easy to verify whether it's the truth or not.

00:41:44.187 --> 00:41:49.427
Supposing you want to ask a question, "Is there God?" - You'll get tremendous vibrations.

00:41:50.887 --> 00:41:55.287
If you say, "Is Freud was a good man?" - You'll get blisters, maybe.

00:42:01.727 --> 00:42:07.187
So, it is within you, just to reach that point where you become so sensitive

00:42:07.467 --> 00:42:13.067
that you can say what is what and you can verify,

00:42:13.767 --> 00:42:20.467
and you can correct yourself, you can diagnose yourself, you can treat yourself, you can treat others,

00:42:20.747 --> 00:42:26.827
you can help the whole world. Like one light which is enlightened can enlighten many lights -

00:42:27.067 --> 00:42:30.607
that's how it is going to work out.

00:42:32.987 --> 00:42:37.187
Yesterday we spent a lot of time asking questions.

00:42:38.147 --> 00:42:44.747
Today if you want, you can ask but not too many and sensible questions will be better

00:42:46.367 --> 00:42:54.387
because I'm not here for election. They ask me questions as if I'm standing for some election or asking for goods from you.

00:42:55.347 --> 00:42:59.447
I have come here to give you what is yours

00:43:03.267 --> 00:43:06.287
- nothing to take.

00:43:10.067 --> 00:43:18.007
[INAUDIBLE]

00:43:18.287 --> 00:43:26.247
[INAUDIBLE]

00:43:26.467 --> 00:43:34.027
I will, little later we'll do that, that's good. Listening to Me you may not, may some people maybe but you will be.

00:43:34.447 --> 00:43:41.007
I'm happy that you're anxious to get the enlightenment - it's correct, very correct attitude.

00:43:44.487 --> 00:43:48.747
Does it, does it matter if you're following another teaching?

00:43:49.567 --> 00:43:52.567
Depends on.

00:43:53.967 --> 00:44:00.647
You see, if you're following the teachings which are against natural things, naturally

00:44:02.487 --> 00:44:09.287
how can you judge - let us see on Kundalini. Kundalini immediately indicates

00:44:12.847 --> 00:44:18.187
All right? If you're following a wrong person then it indicates immediately

00:44:18.687 --> 00:44:26.067
and then you better give up, all right, in that case. Whatever is good for you, you should take it.

00:44:28.847 --> 00:44:34.247
There have been horrible people in this world, I must confess.

00:44:34.527 --> 00:44:41.367
I'm very sorry, so many have been Indians who came around spoiling the name of India.

00:44:43.047 --> 00:44:48.827
I don't know what to say and taking full advantage

00:44:49.807 --> 00:44:55.147
of your ignorance about this knowledge.

00:44:59.687 --> 00:45:06.427
Uh.. I have to just say one thing, that you must give a full test

00:45:07.387 --> 00:45:12.707
of these people - take a full understanding - how?

00:45:13.127 --> 00:45:20.687
For example, if somebody is here and says, "You pay five hundred rupees or five hundred dollars

00:45:21.627 --> 00:45:29.507
for just seeing my face," - you better never see such a face again. [LAUGHTER]

00:45:31.527 --> 00:45:38.247
Or that, "There is some technique which I'll teach you." There is no technique for living things.

00:45:38.467 --> 00:45:42.027
It's already built-in, it works out by itself.

00:45:42.807 --> 00:45:48.467
Or anybody who says, "There's a course you have to go through," - there is no course.

00:45:49.327 --> 00:45:54.427
What is a course of a tree that is growing -  do you give a course to that tree?

00:45:54.627 --> 00:46:00.347
All right, you have five days' course - [LAUGHTER] It will grow despite everything.

00:46:02.927 --> 00:46:05.987
Then,

00:46:09.387 --> 00:46:14.887
you cannot take any money in the name of God.

00:46:17.807 --> 00:46:23.787
You cannot live on the earnings in the name of God.

00:46:28.327 --> 00:46:35.547
We don't believe in priesthoods in sahaja yoga. You have to do your normal work

00:46:35.787 --> 00:46:40.067
you have to be married, you must have children, you must live like normal people

00:46:40.267 --> 00:46:43.287
and be spiritually developed.

00:46:45.787 --> 00:46:49.187
We don't have all these systems that people had

00:46:49.407 --> 00:46:55.027
where we become a priest and you pay them money - the priest is taking money and living on that.

00:46:55.687 --> 00:47:00.667
God has nothing to do with money, He actually doesn't understand any money.

00:47:06.687 --> 00:47:11.627
If you put only this test, then most of them will be finished.

00:47:17.547 --> 00:47:22.807
We may say, how are they to live? They should live by, as they have been living.

00:47:23.027 --> 00:47:28.327
They can teach in the school, they can sell things in the market, do what they like.

00:47:32.367 --> 00:47:35.567
What is the need to take money?

00:47:37.987 --> 00:47:44.127
Now for Me, I must say, luckily in this lifetime, I have

00:47:44.767 --> 00:47:50.167
a good husband and we're well off but still

00:47:50.487 --> 00:47:56.647
if these boys want to pay, say, for My travelling they can pay to the travel agent, not to Me.

00:48:01.587 --> 00:48:09.147
If they give Me any presents, I can return them sweetly, something of the same kind or better.

00:48:10.327 --> 00:48:14.147
But there should not be any greed.

00:48:17.407 --> 00:48:23.007
Sometimes you feel like giving flowers - all right, then I must also return it.

00:48:24.007 --> 00:48:27.247
All matter has this value is to

00:48:30.107 --> 00:48:37.847
gives and communicate your feelings to another - that's the only thing a matter can do

00:48:41.687 --> 00:48:44.907
and that's what we should utilize it for.

00:48:50.207 --> 00:48:58.207
So this ghost of materialism will drop out. It's a ghost, I tell you and it's growing bigger and bigger.

00:48:59.847 --> 00:49:06.847
I won't be surprised after some time people won't have their hair, won't have their teeth, won't have their ears left.

00:49:07.947 --> 00:49:14.447
Because all kinds of things they tell you to do to your hair, all kinds of things they tell you to do to your face -

00:49:14.647 --> 00:49:17.667
I mean, it's going on and on and on.

00:49:17.947 --> 00:49:25.107
The kind of food we have to eat, God knows whether we are to eating plastic or polyester. [LAUGHTER]

00:49:28.347 --> 00:49:34.107
Everything becoming uh.. materialistic. With sahaja yoga

00:49:34.647 --> 00:49:40.927
you can transform non-hybrid seeds for such

00:49:41.347 --> 00:49:49.107
great germination power that they can produce crops better than hybrid - this we have experimented.

00:49:57.167 --> 00:50:02.867
What's this question there? Somebody was asking.

00:50:03.767 --> 00:50:06.787
It's gone away or what?

00:50:07.887 --> 00:50:12.407
- All right.
- Mother, [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:14.727 --> 00:50:19.347
Can you speak out, it's raining outside, we can't hear?

00:50:22.947 --> 00:50:28.967
- She tends to sleep twelve to fourteen hours a day, she said that
- She sleeps a lot
- sleeps a lot

00:50:29.347 --> 00:50:35.747
You're left sided, that's all - we'll work it out, all right. It's very simple to give a balance to yourself.

00:50:37.747 --> 00:50:44.147
That's simple. You're a left sided person, that's why you sleep more.

00:50:54.247 --> 00:51:00.107
- Can, can somebody stand up and say things?
- He's asking the question
- Is he?

00:51:01.747 --> 00:51:09.247
[INAUDIBLE AND UNCLEAR]

00:51:27.767 --> 00:51:32.947
Mother, may Your Holiness explain us

00:51:33.367 --> 00:51:41.027
whether there is a difference between a knowledge, a steady wisdom and Self- realization?

00:51:41.787 --> 00:51:46.887
If there is a difference in what aspect do they differ?

00:51:47.247 --> 00:51:53.167
- What is the difference between Self-realization and knowledge?
- It's just the same.
- And

00:51:53.727 --> 00:52:00.387
No difference. You see in the Vedas it is written Vid - Vid is the word used in Sanskrit language -

00:52:00.627 --> 00:52:03.667
means to know on your Central Nervous System.

00:52:04.047 --> 00:52:10.347
Whatever is known on your Central Nervous System is the knowledge, the rest of it is just

00:52:10.567 --> 00:52:15.267
'Shabd Pandityam' means only the word, the words.

00:52:15.727 --> 00:52:21.207
Words and words. Whatever you know on your Central Nervous System is the Knowledge.

00:52:21.487 --> 00:52:24.747
the rest of it is just talking, talking, talking.

00:52:32.567 --> 00:52:38.587
What's it? - [UNCLEAR AND INAUDIBLE]

00:52:38.847 --> 00:52:41.887
Knowledge, wisdom and Self-realization.

00:52:42.167 --> 00:52:49.887
Huh.. Now, Knowledge - When you have knowledge you get wisdom automatically - is a result of that, all right?

00:52:59.947 --> 00:53:05.447
- What is it yet?
-  [UNCLEAR] he wants to be detached

00:53:05.787 --> 00:53:12.427
Yes, by, by realization you become detached and then you become wise.

00:53:13.467 --> 00:53:19.067
All right. By Self-realization you automatically become detached

00:53:19.307 --> 00:53:23.427
and you develop a witness state and that's how you become wise.

00:53:25.687 --> 00:53:28.647
All right, now let others say.

00:53:30.507 --> 00:53:34.747
These are half-read Indians. Haan, what's it?

00:53:39.667 --> 00:53:47.627
- Yes, My child.
- I have a question about re-birthing and whether that is an advanced technique, it's very common nowadays.

00:53:49.227 --> 00:53:55.347
- [UNCLEAR] re-birthing
- Annh?
- Re-birthing, the technique of re-birthing

00:53:55.687 --> 00:54:00.207
It's the technique that's being solved in, in example in Sydney

00:54:00.427 --> 00:54:06.507
- What it is?
- It's a technique where people are made to re-live their birth

00:54:10.707 --> 00:54:15.267
- That's the vogue, that's the fashion?
- The fashion.
- What is that?

00:54:15.547 --> 00:54:22.887
A technique called re-birthing where people pay money and they made to re-live their birth

00:54:23.067 --> 00:54:29.947
their actual physical birth to clear any sub-conscious', sub-conscious blocks that are there in the system.

00:54:30.287 --> 00:54:33.347
She wants to know that's an advanced...
