WEBVTT

04:12.071 --> 04:18.311
[CLAPPING]

04:18.587 --> 04:21.847
We said on our National television to day that

04:22.287 --> 04:25.107
sahaja yoga is a respectable yoga

04:26.387 --> 04:30.847
because of some so called yogas that have gone before.

04:31.567 --> 04:34.547
Shri Mataji has come to

04:37.687 --> 04:43.607
show us the truth because that's what we all desire for.

04:44.247 --> 04:48.167
That we have a special reason for existence -

04:50.007 --> 04:53.087
- it is to find the truth.

04:54.007 --> 04:59.567
And those of us who have been blessed to be with Her

05:00.807 --> 05:05.827
have found the truth. So She's come to Sydney

05:07.767 --> 05:10.827
to tell us about the truth.

05:12.487 --> 05:17.887
In a very troubled world, has arrived with

05:18.247 --> 05:24.947
many other wrong answers to our troubles - the answers of drugs, hard and soft

05:25.867 --> 05:31.767
and other things that distract us - we found that those are not the answer.

05:34.347 --> 05:39.547
Holy Mother thank You for coming and thank You for being with us.

05:41.567 --> 05:47.207
So, once again, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

06:00.827 --> 06:05.267
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

06:07.627 --> 06:11.627
The idea about truth

06:12.287 --> 06:16.967
is sometimes a misconception.

06:18.567 --> 06:24.867
Truth is what it is and will be the truth.

06:25.687 --> 06:31.387
We cannot change it, we cannot organize it,

06:31.747 --> 06:36.687
we cannot work it out - it remains what it is.

06:37.567 --> 06:43.847
And the greatest truth is that we all have become human beings

06:44.567 --> 06:50.187
to become the spirit. We're still

06:52.347 --> 06:58.987
not in that stage that's why there are problems around us.

07:00.427 --> 07:05.547
Once you become the truth, it being the Absolute,

07:05.787 --> 07:11.127
you reach the state of Absoluteness. Then there is

07:12.007 --> 07:16.927
no difference of ideologies,

07:18.907 --> 07:22.967
no differences of nation -

07:23.967 --> 07:29.607
- all nations one knows are created by God Almighty.

07:30.907 --> 07:38.847
Just He created variety to give a beautiful world to us.

07:40.747 --> 07:45.987
Variety always gives beauty.

07:46.547 --> 07:52.707
That's why this variety was created just to make the world very interesting

07:53.027 --> 07:58.407
but not for fighting or for quarreling or for believing

07:58.667 --> 08:04.107
that this part belongs to us and that part belongs to somebody else.

08:12.827 --> 08:20.847
The human problem, as I have studied, is very simple -

08:22.687 --> 08:29.147
- is to be understood in a detached way.

08:30.747 --> 08:38.887
Now here you can see the beautiful machinery that is working within ourselves.

08:39.967 --> 08:47.487
If you see on the left-hand side we have [ASIDE - SOMEBODY SHOULD COME AND SHOW] blue colored line

08:48.467 --> 08:53.347
and the right-hand side you see a yellow line.

08:54.867 --> 08:58.907
In the center you see a white channel

09:03.107 --> 09:10.667
These are our Autonomous Nervous Systems - three channels -

09:10.927 --> 09:15.087
Left and Right Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Nervous System.

09:15.647 --> 09:22.347
When I talk of Medical Science people get quite surprised.

09:22.947 --> 09:29.367
But it has something to do to understand what are we inside ourselves.

09:30.007 --> 09:35.707
Now this Parasympathetic Nervous System is a system that gives us balance.

09:37.107 --> 09:43.367
For example, if I'm running fast, My heart will start thumping

09:43.687 --> 09:47.407
but it comes to normal through Parasympathetic Nervous System.

09:47.667 --> 09:54.647
And Medical Science doesn't know much about the Parasympathetic Nervous System which is actually in the center.

09:55.787 --> 10:01.327
These chakras are around the Parasympathetic Nervous System and

10:03.727 --> 10:11.667
like My fingers here, this is the chakra in the center here

10:11.907 --> 10:19.087
and this the Left Sympathetic and this the Right Sympathetic and they both put together make this center

10:19.327 --> 10:23.147
to form the Parasympathetic - simple as that.

10:24.387 --> 10:32.347
Now what happens with human-beings, that they have a capacity, they have a freedom also

10:33.047 --> 10:40.287
to go to the left or to the right. They can be very emotional people.

10:40.647 --> 10:46.827
They can go to the emotional side to such an extent that they can become fanatics.

10:50.007 --> 10:54.687
They can go further with it so that

10:55.947 --> 11:03.487
the left side which represents our Subconscious,

11:05.007 --> 11:09.927
then the Collective Subconscious can be entered into.

11:10.707 --> 11:14.707
So they can enter into Collective Subconscious also.

11:17.107 --> 11:23.427
Subconscious also has 3 - 4 layers that is we can say the Present Subconscious,

11:23.827 --> 11:27.847
the Past Subconscious and the Subconscious of ages.

11:28.607 --> 11:34.707
Then the Collective Subconscious where all that is dead exists in that area.

11:36.487 --> 11:43.647
Now, when you move too much on that side, you get attacked by that side

11:44.587 --> 11:52.547
and that side has got all that is dead which attacks you, which triggers you.

11:56.607 --> 12:04.227
On the right hand side we have got another channel of the Right Sympathetic Nervous System.

12:06.247 --> 12:13.967
This channel represents our activity and our future.

12:15.687 --> 12:23.647
So when you're overactive, you're working very hard, you're futuristic - all the time thinking about the future

12:24.767 --> 12:28.127
- you start moving towards the right side

12:29.047 --> 12:37.187
to such an extent that you can enter into your Collective Supra-conscious also.

12:37.507 --> 12:44.307
In the same way you have got your Present Supra-conscious and also Collective Supra-conscious.

12:47.347 --> 12:54.007
Now, human beings have a capacity, that they can move to the left and to the right with their attention.

12:54.247 --> 13:01.467
They can project their attention to the left or to their right or they can be moderate in the center.

13:03.327 --> 13:10.567
So, when people talked of religion - I mean the real people who came on this earth, they talked of religion -

13:10.987 --> 13:18.727
they talked about our valency, that's a human valency is of ten number -

13:18.967 --> 13:25.507
and that's why they talked of ten commandments. Or in every religion they talked about it

13:25.767 --> 13:31.447
that we have to keep this balance. When we go out of this balance

13:31.647 --> 13:35.027
then we either move to the left or to the right.

13:36.407 --> 13:41.487
But, if you see the history of religions, it is just the opposite.

13:43.047 --> 13:47.887
That all these religions have created conditionings within us -

13:49.027 --> 13:53.447
a kind of a fanatism, a kind of a blind faith

13:54.947 --> 13:59.607
which was never the purpose of establishing your

14:00.087 --> 14:03.707
valencies within yourself.

14:06.107 --> 14:13.107
The movement to the right is also another problem of the modern times.

14:13.927 --> 14:20.307
When we move to the right, we actually start becoming very egoistical.

14:22.067 --> 14:28.467
The activity that we form, the activity that we perform

14:29.887 --> 14:35.887
creates a balloon like structure on our head, as you see, crossing over here,

14:36.867 --> 14:40.727
as ego - that yellow stuff.

14:43.227 --> 14:51.387
On the left hand side when we're conditioned very much, we get another balloon, which we call as super-ego.

14:57.467 --> 15:03.227
Jung also, missed the point because he described

15:03.447 --> 15:09.067
that there're layers horizontally placed within ourselves - it is not so.

15:10.187 --> 15:16.007
God, is a great constructor and a manager.

15:16.287 --> 15:23.967
For example, you have put a road for Me here - I don't have to pass through different, different rows.

15:24.827 --> 15:31.247
In the same way He placed everything in a vertical way

15:31.647 --> 15:36.287
and the road to realization is kept free within us.

15:37.887 --> 15:41.887
The road to realization is straightforward, which you see,

15:42.167 --> 15:47.007
is the shown in the white color, is the Parasympathetic Nervous System.

15:50.067 --> 15:55.667
Now those people who move to the left or to the right, develop diseases.

15:56.427 --> 16:02.287
For example, I'll show you here, now supposing, I move one finger too much here

16:02.567 --> 16:05.927
then I'm cut off, cut off with the main -

16:07.607 --> 16:14.947
this side is cut off with the main, this side is cut off with the main. Then what happens that there is no control

16:17.007 --> 16:23.867
and the cells become malignant, on their own. They start over-powering others

16:24.207 --> 16:29.707
and that's how they start destroying other cells - we say cancer has been established.

16:33.047 --> 16:39.287
Is a very simple thing, is to bring them back again and put them in contact

16:40.347 --> 16:43.887
with the Divine and bring them to the mains.

16:46.507 --> 16:53.507
Secondly, people have these days diseases like Diabetes - very common, Diabetes is a very common disease.

16:54.587 --> 16:59.847
Now in Indian villages, the villagers when they take tea

17:00.427 --> 17:07.467
they say, the we must take so much sugar that the spoon must stand in the sugar.

17:07.847 --> 17:14.027
And they drink such a lot of sugar - they never have Diabetes, never - they have never known Diabetes.

17:18.127 --> 17:22.147
What is the cause of Diabetes or liver trouble

17:22.487 --> 17:27.007
or we can say, other troubles like Blood Cancer?

17:27.567 --> 17:33.307
Is a very simple thing that we do - is the imbalance within us.

17:34.807 --> 17:39.507
Is you see, the yellow center we call as Swadhisthana,

17:40.267 --> 17:45.787
which looks after the Aortic plexus in our body, on the physical level,

17:46.327 --> 17:50.267
this center has a very special work to do

17:51.567 --> 17:57.207
that is to convert the fat cells for the use of the brain.

17:57.967 --> 18:01.607
So it converts the fat cells for the use of the brain.

18:02.787 --> 18:10.387
If people are very futuristic - all the time thinking, thinking, thinking - then this poor

18:12.667 --> 18:19.247
center or chakra has one work, is to convert cells after cells for the use of the brain.

18:19.607 --> 18:24.667
Brain starts growing but what about the other function it has to do?

18:25.027 --> 18:31.687
It has to look after the liver, it has to look after the pancreas,

18:32.187 --> 18:39.767
it has to look after the spleen, it has to look after part of the intestines and also the kidneys.

18:41.987 --> 18:47.427
When we start thinking too much, we give too much work to this one center

18:48.467 --> 18:54.427
all these visceras are neglected and you may develop any one of these troubles.

18:55.207 --> 18:58.327
But when it comes to spleen, it is even worse.

18:59.947 --> 19:06.127
When it comes to spleen - these days the life is so hectic - first of all,

19:06.487 --> 19:13.027
we get up in the morning, first thing we do is to read the newspaper - that's the horrid thing to do.

19:14.247 --> 19:19.127
Coming out of very nice sleep, you suddenly read the newspaper and so many are bombed,

19:19.347 --> 19:22.867
so many are killed and so many are harassed - Oh God!

19:23.947 --> 19:27.127
You get a shock, the system gets a shock.

19:29.287 --> 19:33.067
Now, when the system gets a shock, the spleen has to

19:33.567 --> 19:37.967
produce more Red blood corpuscles - it has to work very hard.

19:38.307 --> 19:44.367
Then you suddenly discover, you have to go to your work, so you get out of your bed and rush here and there,

19:44.627 --> 19:51.567
brush your teeth on your way and carry your breakfast - maybe your wife is running after you with the breakfast - you have no time for anything.

19:51.807 --> 19:55.867
Such a hectic life you lead - extremely hectic.

19:56.187 --> 20:00.027
Then you get into the car, you find there's a jam - finished.

20:00.327 --> 20:04.827
Is a, we don't understand how much you're shocking ourselves all the time.

20:05.127 --> 20:09.647
We are on a war path with the watch.

20:10.967 --> 20:14.907
All the time struggling for time, struggling for time.

20:15.867 --> 20:20.687
This spleen doesn't understand the person -

20:22.247 --> 20:26.087
there's no rhythm in the life of that person.

20:27.047 --> 20:35.027
The spleen thinks, what am I to do now? Suddenly this person needs the Red blood corpuscles, then it doesn't need, then suddenly it needs it - it becomes hectic.

20:37.327 --> 20:44.887
It needs hec.. when it becomes hectic, it becomes vulnerable for Blood Cancer.

20:45.567 --> 20:53.507
And then, if a person gets any shock or goes to the left side in an emotional way, he gets Blood Cancer.

20:54.387 --> 21:01.187
Even the mothers who are like this, very hectic, disciplining their children, "Keep the carpet clean,

21:01.647 --> 21:07.447
eh..walk this way, first put your right foot then left foot, don't walk that way" -

21:09.707 --> 21:14.767
the child, when she's pregnant, can get Blood Cancer.

21:19.667 --> 21:26.007
We must understand we are delicately made beautiful flowers of God, we're human beings

21:27.307 --> 21:31.547
and the time has come for us to become now the fruits.

21:32.007 --> 21:38.567
This is the blossom time. But we shock our system with so many things - for what have we achieved?

21:41.887 --> 21:48.807
In India we have Taj Mahal, we have Ajanta caves, we have so many things to show you

21:49.087 --> 21:56.587
but they are all in the past. I don't think in Sydney you can make a hall like this anymore - is not possible.

21:58.527 --> 22:01.687
What have we achieved - plastics?

22:04.287 --> 22:07.307
What are we achieving?

22:09.047 --> 22:16.307
The modern times we have lost the sense of greatness and glorious things.

22:18.307 --> 22:23.747
All the time you're struggling with time and no body has time.

22:25.267 --> 22:32.647
Everybody is rushing up. I asked one gentleman, "Why're you in such a hurry to go to London, after all,

22:32.987 --> 22:37.187
it's all right you can go tomorrow, if you don't get the seat today you can go tomorrow?"

22:37.347 --> 22:40.327
He said, "No, I have to attend a ball."

22:41.087 --> 22:45.887
He'll waste 3 hours in the ball or in a pub, that's all right.

22:46.707 --> 22:54.007
But, he's so worried about getting his ticket - for that he will completely rattle his system.

22:56.707 --> 23:00.147
Just to get the ticket and that for what?

23:00.427 --> 23:05.727
That ball is not going to give him any relaxation because he's already finished his system.

23:06.027 --> 23:10.527
That's how one develops this Blood Cancer.

23:14.147 --> 23:20.267
Then the pancreas is out of order, one develops Diabetes

23:20.887 --> 23:24.127
Kidneys are out of order - high blood pressure.

23:24.667 --> 23:30.207
Then all kinds of kidney troubles and then they go on the machine and all kinds of things happen.

23:36.267 --> 23:41.947
It is happening in all the nonsensical things also we have taken.

23:42.687 --> 23:48.487
Like for us now, so far he was, Mr. Freud was

23:48.887 --> 23:54.647
had displaced Christ completely. He had become Christ for us.

23:56.227 --> 24:02.107
Blind-folded we followed him and also out-witted him

24:02.567 --> 24:07.487
in our projections. "What's wrong?"

24:09.927 --> 24:14.107
When I went to America in '73

24:14.767 --> 24:21.087
I told them that this is all wrong you're doing, it will have a very bad effect, it's not natural.

24:22.007 --> 24:26.587
If promiscuousness is good, then why does it give diseases?

24:26.847 --> 24:33.947
If it is natural, then why does it give you problems - simple question?

24:38.467 --> 24:44.987
There's a kind of a ego that we can do it - but why fight with the nature?

24:48.627 --> 24:53.267
If you fight with the nature, nature will take it's respite.

24:54.767 --> 25:02.007
And today that's why, we have to say, "This was wrong we have done and we're not going to do it anymore."

25:02.647 --> 25:05.647
Our children are not going to do it.

25:08.847 --> 25:15.087
After going through all the experiences now they're talking that cigarette should be abandoned.

25:17.367 --> 25:24.367
But Nanak Sahab had told long time back that cigarette is the worst thing, it will cause horrible trouble to you.

25:26.647 --> 25:31.227
Now they're saying about no smoking - now they cannot give up.

25:33.487 --> 25:40.687
There are thousand and one problems - the greatest is, I think now, is AIDS -

25:42.187 --> 25:46.387
is caused by nothing but stupid ego.

25:51.267 --> 25:58.267
Anything they try, you ask them why do you do it ; like some people are now coloring their heads.

25:58.747 --> 26:05.747
And I found some of them are becoming blind. So I said, "Why are you doing it?" They said, "What's wrong?"

26:07.667 --> 26:12.947
But why do you want to color your hair? "But what's wrong?" I didn't know what to answer.

26:13.227 --> 26:20.487
I said, "But it will make you blind." "We'll see when it makes us blind." - Such arrogance!

26:22.887 --> 26:30.467
You can't challenge your system like that, you have to be humble about it because it's a delicate system of a human being.

26:31.307 --> 26:38.267
We are not hippopotamus, are we? That on a hippopotamus you paint anything, nothing will happen to him.

26:38.607 --> 26:45.327
But we're human beings, we have got cells here, which absorb paints and that can go on to our nerves,

26:45.567 --> 26:49.127
can also go on to our other centers.

26:52.567 --> 26:58.427
There should be a basic understanding - what is ridiculous?

27:05.487 --> 27:12.907
As if, people have gone a muck and doing all these things - but that's what, you're going to the left or to the right.

27:14.327 --> 27:20.807
Now, those people who move too much to the right, get heart attacks.

27:23.047 --> 27:30.187
They maybe thin like dried fishes but they can get heart attacks.

27:32.427 --> 27:38.847
When you extract too much of your energy on the right side, the heart gives in.

27:44.347 --> 27:50.247
There is no need to put in so much effort

27:52.347 --> 27:56.847
- like one day I met a lady who had a heart attack -

27:57.707 --> 28:01.607
she's just a housewife with only two children.

28:04.087 --> 28:10.227
I said, "Why do you get a heart attack, madam?" She said, "I've to work very hard, You know."

28:11.327 --> 28:18.127
"With two children what do you do?" "Oh, I've to keep everything clean, absolutely clean,

28:18.367 --> 28:24.327
to keep my children clean, I've to keep my husband clean, I've to keep my bathroom clean, to keep," and I said,

28:24.727 --> 28:31.727
"It's all right, but why don't you understand that also your health is there and you should take some rest in between."

28:32.027 --> 28:36.827
"No, to me cleanliness is everything." Then you have the heart attack.

28:39.167 --> 28:43.867
This is the norms of today's life.

28:44.507 --> 28:49.227
I don't think our parents used to polish everything all the time

28:49.567 --> 28:55.367
or they were all the time with a vacuum cleaner, you see, like a tail we have a vacuum cleaner with us.

28:56.267 --> 29:02.707
Doesn't matter, it's house. After all, it should be a cozy place for children

29:03.027 --> 29:08.187
and for the husband to come down. Doesn't matter, once you clean it, it's all right.

29:08.727 --> 29:13.467
But that kind of a attitude we cannot take because that's the norm.

29:16.547 --> 29:21.787
So many norms we have which are really absurd and ridiculous.

29:22.427 --> 29:26.427
We can never sit down and enjoy each other's company.

29:26.887 --> 29:34.567
If the husband and wife are sitting, there should be a television in between or some sort of a drama or something.

29:36.047 --> 29:42.447
There should be something in between, they cannot talk to each other - there's no relaxing mood.

29:42.667 --> 29:46.267
There's so much to be talked between husband and wife.

29:46.507 --> 29:53.067
I mean, when husband wife are enjoying themselves and talking to each other, it's better to switch off the horrible

29:53.387 --> 29:58.127
television which is showing the quarrel between husband and wife all the time.

30:03.187 --> 30:11.087
So, all these things work out - the family system, the household and the all the norms we have started.

30:11.767 --> 30:17.467
All these things work out on our sweet beautiful system that we have.

30:19.327 --> 30:23.347
We are fighting all the time with each other, for what?

30:24.327 --> 30:32.507
This is what takes us to the extremes and these extremes are responsible for giving us all these problems.

30:36.787 --> 30:42.367
Now, with the Kundalini awakening, when She rises, passes through those centers -

30:42.627 --> 30:47.447
first of all She puts them like a slot, they all come back,

30:48.867 --> 30:55.107
fall in lines, She awakens them, gives them energy, the energy flows out

30:55.447 --> 30:58.967
cures cancer, cures this, cures that, cures that.

31:00.587 --> 31:06.207
Then it passes through your Agnya chakra here, where you forgive everyone.

31:09.147 --> 31:15.847
You just forgive. You don't know, what a weapon Christ has given us to forgive.

31:16.807 --> 31:21.127
Half of the marriages would be all right if we know how to forgive.

31:23.267 --> 31:29.787
Just makes you a sweet, beautiful, charming person

31:30.147 --> 31:35.167
in the real sense of the word, not outwardly because you're dressed up well or you have

31:35.447 --> 31:43.047
a beautiful ornament or something like that. You really become a very charming person in the sense

31:43.247 --> 31:50.667
that you charm the children, you charm your family, you charm the whole world.

31:52.627 --> 31:59.287
Because once you start forgiving, the love of your heart starts pouring everywhere.

32:01.587 --> 32:09.567
When She opens this last center, actually here on the fontanel bone area, where you get your real baptism

32:10.747 --> 32:16.567
this is the, we call the seat of the heart center, seat of the heart center.

32:18.447 --> 32:21.927
When She opens the transformation starts

32:24.367 --> 32:30.927
and you start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. So, the transformation in the temperament,

32:32.447 --> 32:37.947
in the behavior of a person - you immediately notice the face changing -

32:38.227 --> 32:45.167
the tense face that you see suddenly becomes mellowed down - we're relaxed.

32:46.047 --> 32:53.547
And this Kundalini awakening then kept up well, makes you grow spiritually.

32:54.767 --> 33:00.287
And the spiritual growth in a person is what we want today.

33:00.927 --> 33:09.407
Of course, no diseases, no physical problems, no mental problems -

33:11.507 --> 33:16.827
many mad people have been cured, this Schizophrenia has been cured with sahaja yoga.

33:17.607 --> 33:24.107
Is all because our spirit has not come into our attention.

33:25.267 --> 33:30.767
Spirit is the light but the light we see here is jarring sometimes -

33:31.127 --> 33:35.867
has nothing in it - the light of the spirit has love -

33:37.647 --> 33:45.447
is beautiful love about which we have heard about, which is All Pervading, is all over

33:45.987 --> 33:53.007
and you just feel absolutely sure of yourself as if you're entered

33:53.667 --> 33:59.387
into the beautiful hall of God's kingdom where you're secured, you're respected,

33:59.707 --> 34:03.247
you're loved, you're looked after - is a fact.

34:05.347 --> 34:09.907
But we have to enter there and we have to receive that blessing.

34:11.427 --> 34:16.107
Then this physical things look nothing, insignificant.

34:16.347 --> 34:20.987
If somebody has some problem you can go and cure it, I need not be there.

34:22.527 --> 34:27.507
You can raise the Kundalini of other people. This is your birthright

34:28.047 --> 34:33.027
to get the Kundalini awakened and to have your real baptism.

34:35.607 --> 34:41.527
You have got it within yourself, all is your power - I'm doing nothing,

34:41.867 --> 34:48.547
maybe a catalyst - for a little while and then you become the catalyst.

34:51.307 --> 34:55.667
The whole world can change and transform itself

34:56.447 --> 35:01.807
if it follows the power of love. We have never used the power of love -

35:02.007 --> 35:05.447
is all the power of hatred all the time.

35:05.747 --> 35:11.707
But the power of love that is Divine love is devoid of lust and greed -

35:12.387 --> 35:15.607
is just you enjoy the loving of love.

35:18.507 --> 35:25.127
And that situation when it works, you see the whole world in a different way

35:25.567 --> 35:30.167
and you develop that witness state which is described many a times by many saints

35:30.367 --> 35:33.387
and many prophets and Incarnations.

35:34.587 --> 35:41.507
It's a very easy thing to happen, it is spontaneous because it's the living force,

35:42.047 --> 35:50.087
is the living thing - you cannot pay for it, it's ridiculous to think that you can pay for it - you cannot.

35:52.727 --> 36:00.627
How much money did we pay to the plants which produce these beautiful flowers - nothing.

36:00.987 --> 36:04.927
They just gave you the flowers because they enjoy giving.

36:07.787 --> 36:15.007
That sort of personalities we all become - beautiful people. Actually we have wasted our life quite a lot.

36:16.247 --> 36:22.307
After realization we understand how valuable we are, how glorified we are,

36:22.887 --> 36:29.987
how God loves us and how He looks after us moment to moment!

36:33.107 --> 36:40.407
These imbalances within us have now increased more by time

36:41.967 --> 36:49.487
because the ego increased a lot and then we said, "Why not do this, why not try this, why not try that,"

36:49.787 --> 36:57.407
like everybody going a muck trying this, trying that, trying that. Everything new they should have,

37:01.027 --> 37:08.027
they did not believe in what people told them before, they discarded all that and they said, "Let's try everything new."

37:08.807 --> 37:14.167
Like, the other day we were having a banquet and there was an ambassador sitting next to Me

37:14.447 --> 37:19.707
and he said, "I know, You don't like Freud." Oh, I said, " I don't like him at all."

37:20.867 --> 37:26.147
But he said, "He told us something new, while Hume didn't tell us something new, You see."

37:26.587 --> 37:32.767
I said, "All right, we've had dinner many a times but we have never eaten the table, let's have it."

37:33.247 --> 37:39.607
[LAUGHTER] That's a new thing, why not? He was shocked at Me.

37:42.707 --> 37:47.147
He said, " Everything new can be very dangerous."

37:48.947 --> 37:52.967
Let us try with the snakes, let us try with the tigers.

37:57.167 --> 38:04.447
This is the trouble with us. We have to humble down to understand that no, this

38:04.667 --> 38:11.827
is a trust of God within us - this body of ours - we have no business to insult it,

38:13.227 --> 38:20.587
to be disrespectful to it, to waste it - we have to respect it.

38:23.647 --> 38:31.507
With what difficulty it was made, the whole, you see, beautiful mechanism that is made within us

38:32.387 --> 38:36.287
and it works so spontaneously, so beautifully -

38:38.147 --> 38:42.147
even whatever you have done to it, doesn't matter, forget it -

38:43.587 --> 38:47.827
even if you have not respected it, forget it.

38:48.367 --> 38:54.967
Please don't develop any guilt - that's another disease of the modern times - everybody is guilty.

38:57.167 --> 39:02.767
Why are you guilty? You're human beings, if you have done mistakes so it's all right.

39:04.107 --> 39:09.807
It's for God to correct it - that's His job, so give Him to do that job.

39:10.127 --> 39:13.167
But we shouldn't go on doing the mistakes.

39:14.067 --> 39:18.747
Once we're blessed by Him, let us enjoy.

39:19.787 --> 39:25.627
Now many scientists say that there is no God - I think it's very unscientific to say that.

39:27.407 --> 39:30.447
A scientist must have an open mind.

39:31.847 --> 39:35.767
If he doesn't have an open mind, he's not a scientist at all.

39:36.027 --> 39:39.667
He has not known anything about God, how does he say there's no God.

39:42.787 --> 39:47.467
You may say that the way religion is followed, is wrong - I agree there.

39:48.127 --> 39:54.567
The way they make money in the name of God, is wrong - I agree there - but there is God.

39:57.767 --> 40:05.807
Definitely there is God - keep your minds open like a scientist and also,

40:08.747 --> 40:15.447
what I say is a hypothesis to you - tomorrow it will become a law and you'll be amazed

40:15.747 --> 40:22.267
the laws of God's love are so definite,

40:23.047 --> 40:30.967
unchangeable, they work so beautifully. For example, when you get your realization

40:32.407 --> 40:37.507
you feel the cool breeze on top of your head and you feel the cool breeze all around your fingers.

40:39.767 --> 40:46.587
These fingers tell you - one, two, three, four, five, six and seven -

40:46.947 --> 40:50.827
seven centers that are within you - which one is catching.

40:54.567 --> 41:01.087
Is said so - Mohammad Sahab has said, "Your hands will tell you,

41:01.447 --> 41:06.027
they will speak at the time of your resurrection."

41:07.187 --> 41:14.667
Your fingers tell you what's wrong with you, they will tell you what's wrong with another person.

41:16.767 --> 41:24.787
And that's absolute - all those who're realized will say the same thing.

41:28.707 --> 41:35.447
What's wrong with this country, what's wrong with that country, and you can verify it.

41:39.427 --> 41:43.947
It's very easy to verify whether it's the truth or not.

41:44.187 --> 41:49.427
Supposing you want to ask a question, "Is there God?" - You'll get tremendous vibrations.

41:50.887 --> 41:55.287
If you say, "Is Freud was a good man?" - You'll get blisters, maybe.

42:01.727 --> 42:07.187
So, it is within you, just to reach that point where you become so sensitive

42:07.467 --> 42:13.067
that you can say what is what and you can verify,

42:13.767 --> 42:20.467
and you can correct yourself, you can diagnose yourself, you can treat yourself, you can treat others,

42:20.747 --> 42:26.827
you can help the whole world. Like one light which is enlightened can enlighten many lights -

42:27.067 --> 42:30.607
that's how it is going to work out.

42:32.987 --> 42:37.187
Yesterday we spent a lot of time asking questions.

42:38.147 --> 42:44.747
Today if you want, you can ask but not too many and sensible questions will be better

42:46.367 --> 42:54.387
because I'm not here for election. They ask me questions as if I'm standing for some election or asking for goods from you.

42:55.347 --> 42:59.447
I have come here to give you what is yours

43:03.267 --> 43:06.287
- nothing to take.

43:10.067 --> 43:18.007
[INAUDIBLE]

43:18.287 --> 43:26.247
[INAUDIBLE]

43:26.467 --> 43:34.027
I will, little later we'll do that, that's good. Listening to Me you may not, may some people maybe but you will be.

43:34.447 --> 43:41.007
I'm happy that you're anxious to get the enlightenment - it's correct, very correct attitude.

43:44.487 --> 43:48.747
Does it, does it matter if you're following another teaching?

43:49.567 --> 43:52.567
Depends on.

43:53.967 --> 44:00.647
You see, if you're following the teachings which are against natural things, naturally

44:02.487 --> 44:09.287
how can you judge - let us see on Kundalini. Kundalini immediately indicates

44:12.847 --> 44:18.187
All right? If you're following a wrong person then it indicates immediately

44:18.687 --> 44:26.067
and then you better give up, all right, in that case. Whatever is good for you, you should take it.

44:28.847 --> 44:34.247
There have been horrible people in this world, I must confess.

44:34.527 --> 44:41.367
I'm very sorry, so many have been Indians who came around spoiling the name of India.

44:43.047 --> 44:48.827
I don't know what to say and taking full advantage

44:49.807 --> 44:55.147
of your ignorance about this knowledge.

44:59.687 --> 45:06.427
Uh.. I have to just say one thing, that you must give a full test

45:07.387 --> 45:12.707
of these people - take a full understanding - how?

45:13.127 --> 45:20.687
For example, if somebody is here and says, "You pay five hundred rupees or five hundred dollars

45:21.627 --> 45:29.507
for just seeing my face," - you better never see such a face again. [LAUGHTER]

45:31.527 --> 45:38.247
Or that, "There is some technique which I'll teach you." There is no technique for living things.

45:38.467 --> 45:42.027
It's already built-in, it works out by itself.

45:42.807 --> 45:48.467
Or anybody who says, "There's a course you have to go through," - there is no course.

45:49.327 --> 45:54.427
What is a course of a tree that is growing -  do you give a course to that tree?

45:54.627 --> 46:00.347
All right, you have five days' course - [LAUGHTER] It will grow despite everything.

46:02.927 --> 46:05.987
Then,

46:09.387 --> 46:14.887
you cannot take any money in the name of God.

46:17.807 --> 46:23.787
You cannot live on the earnings in the name of God.

46:28.327 --> 46:35.547
We don't believe in priesthoods in sahaja yoga. You have to do your normal work

46:35.787 --> 46:40.067
you have to be married, you must have children, you must live like normal people

46:40.267 --> 46:43.287
and be spiritually developed.

46:45.787 --> 46:49.187
We don't have all these systems that people had

46:49.407 --> 46:55.027
where we become a priest and you pay them money - the priest is taking money and living on that.

46:55.687 --> 47:00.667
God has nothing to do with money, He actually doesn't understand any money.

47:06.687 --> 47:11.627
If you put only this test, then most of them will be finished.

47:17.547 --> 47:22.807
We may say, how are they to live? They should live by, as they have been living.

47:23.027 --> 47:28.327
They can teach in the school, they can sell things in the market, do what they like.

47:32.367 --> 47:35.567
What is the need to take money?

47:37.987 --> 47:44.127
Now for Me, I must say, luckily in this lifetime, I have

47:44.767 --> 47:50.167
a good husband and we're well off but still

47:50.487 --> 47:56.647
if these boys want to pay, say, for My travelling they can pay to the travel agent, not to Me.

48:01.587 --> 48:09.147
If they give Me any presents, I can return them sweetly, something of the same kind or better.

48:10.327 --> 48:14.147
But there should not be any greed.

48:17.407 --> 48:23.007
Sometimes you feel like giving flowers - all right, then I must also return it.

48:24.007 --> 48:27.247
All matter has this value is to

48:30.107 --> 48:37.847
gives and communicate your feelings to another - that's the only thing a matter can do

48:41.687 --> 48:44.907
and that's what we should utilize it for.

48:50.207 --> 48:58.207
So this ghost of materialism will drop out. It's a ghost, I tell you and it's growing bigger and bigger.

48:59.847 --> 49:06.847
I won't be surprised after some time people won't have their hair, won't have their teeth, won't have their ears left.

49:07.947 --> 49:14.447
Because all kinds of things they tell you to do to your hair, all kinds of things they tell you to do to your face -

49:14.647 --> 49:17.667
I mean, it's going on and on and on.

49:17.947 --> 49:25.107
The kind of food we have to eat, God knows whether we are to eating plastic or polyester. [LAUGHTER]

49:28.347 --> 49:34.107
Everything becoming uh.. materialistic. With sahaja yoga

49:34.647 --> 49:40.927
you can transform non-hybrid seeds for such

49:41.347 --> 49:49.107
great germination power that they can produce crops better than hybrid - this we have experimented.

49:57.167 --> 50:02.867
What's this question there? Somebody was asking.

50:03.767 --> 50:06.787
It's gone away or what?

50:07.887 --> 50:12.407
- All right.
- Mother, [INAUDIBLE]

50:14.727 --> 50:19.347
Can you speak out, it's raining outside, we can't hear?

50:22.947 --> 50:28.967
- She tends to sleep twelve to fourteen hours a day, she said that
- She sleeps a lot
- sleeps a lot

50:29.347 --> 50:35.747
You're left sided, that's all - we'll work it out, all right. It's very simple to give a balance to yourself.

50:37.747 --> 50:44.147
That's simple. You're a left sided person, that's why you sleep more.

50:54.247 --> 51:00.107
- Can, can somebody stand up and say things?
- He's asking the question
- Is he?

51:01.747 --> 51:09.247
[INAUDIBLE AND UNCLEAR]

51:27.767 --> 51:32.947
Mother, may Your Holiness explain us

51:33.367 --> 51:41.027
whether there is a difference between a knowledge, a steady wisdom and Self- realization?

51:41.787 --> 51:46.887
If there is a difference in what aspect do they differ?

51:47.247 --> 51:53.167
- What is the difference between Self-realization and knowledge?
- It's just the same.
- And

51:53.727 --> 52:00.387
No difference. You see in the Vedas it is written Vid - Vid is the word used in Sanskrit language -

52:00.627 --> 52:03.667
means to know on your Central Nervous System.

52:04.047 --> 52:10.347
Whatever is known on your Central Nervous System is the knowledge, the rest of it is just

52:10.567 --> 52:15.267
'Shabd Pandityam' means only the word, the words.
