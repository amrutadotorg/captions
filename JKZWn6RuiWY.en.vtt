00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:35.699
Yesterday, you have been explained about the
subtle being within us, a subtle instrument

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:09.559
within us, described in the Bible as Tree
of Life, working out this last breakthrough

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.860
of Self-realization. And this happening is
a living happening, a spontaneous happening,

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:37.049
the way a seed sprouts spontaneously when
it is embedded in the Mother Earth. The problem

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:52.369
with the human mind is such that he thinks
or it thinks that it can work out its own

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:07.249
realization, its own emancipation.
We do not understand a simple thing that at

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:25.390
the human level, we do not do anything that
is living. We cannot germinate a seed even

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:38.110
on that. We cannot even create anything that
is dead. We can just transform one dead into

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.230
another form. But we cannot understand that
whatever we may try, we cannot lay our hands

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:07.909
on the living process. Only after Self-realization
you are entitled. You get powers to do living

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:21.579
work.
That is the sign of a person who is born again,

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:28.579
who is a yogi, who has had a union with the
Divine. It is not those who proclaim or announce

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.540
or advertise that we are something special
selected people that we have the powers or

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:54.239
that we can take you to Divine. One can really
produce results. Results can only be produced

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:07.719
of living process when you have the power
of your spirit.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:16.230
We have heard about Christ who cured people
and He cured at that time -- in such a short

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:29.070
time as it was hardly about twenty-one people
â€' and He was crucified. We could not

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:38.690
bear the truth that He was the Son of God.
Now, maybe one may create big huge organizations

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:48.190
in His name, make big money in His name and
do all kinds of things, but when He was there,

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:55.190
He was present, they denied Him.
So as we see within ourself there is this

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:08.860
power which has to manifest, we should be
very anxious to get our Self-realization.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:18.840
If I say there is a diamond available here
-- just free, it's your own â€' people

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.730
would come not only from San Diego but also
from Australia, India, Japan and all over

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:31.730
the world asking for it. But when I say, "There
is this diamond within you in your heart,"

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:39.370
still we are identifying with so many falsehoods
that we do not want that diamond to shine

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:50.170
in our attention. It is a surprise. But I
am not surprised because we are still ignorant.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:04.120
We do not know how beautifully we are made,
how in our evolutionary process we are built

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:12.270
in so beautifully -- the whole information
about the truth. Only this machinery has to

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:19.940
work out. Only this has to get connected with
the Divine.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:27.520
If we really logically, intelligently understand
that the living process has to work spontaneously

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:42.580
and you can't do anything about it, you can
understand how Sahaja Yoga works. It's all

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:53.290
there. One does not have to do anything. It's
all there, like a little seed. A minutest

00:06:54.310 --> 00:07:00.900
one maybe has all the maps of all the trees
you'll be able to produce. In the same way,

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:07.900
within you lies this potential which is to
be manifested.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:15.410
We have been also told about the left and
right side within us. Left and right side

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:27.060
are the only two sides to which our attention
can go, which represents our sympathetic nervous

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:34.340
system. That is when you go into any emergency.
Suppose you are rushing somewhere or running,

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:41.900
your sympathetic goes into action and creates
the results necessary for that action. For

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:53.060
example, you have to run; so the sympathetic
will start pumping the blood fast, will start

00:07:53.270 --> 00:08:00.270
breathing fast. But what brings it back to
normal is the central path, what we call represented

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:12.430
in the medical terminology as parasympathetic
nervous system. So in our own effort we can

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:20.340
only go to the left or right. But when we
try to go too much to the left or right, we

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:28.810
create problems, which we cannot explain and
we cannot understand.

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:34.779
The first and foremost problem we create is
the physical problem. Today there are so many

00:08:34.779 --> 00:08:41.779
diseases. We cannot understand how these diseases
came into being and what is the nature of

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:52.110
its creation or how are we going to get rid
of this. Everybody is afraid of that unknown

00:08:55.130 --> 00:09:02.130
disease and these unknown diseases can fall
up to anyone, whatever you may say, unless

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:11.270
and until you become a spirit. How they are
caused is a very simple thing to understand.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:19.460
The physical problems come to us because of
our imbalances.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:26.460
In various ways we try to go to the left or
to the right. Now, let us see how cancer is

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:35.000
caused because that is the headache of today,
or maybe of yesterday -- today's headache

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:42.000
is something else. Cancer is caused only because
we do not keep to our temperament right. If

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:58.750
I say that this is the center that is formed
by the left and the right side, then this

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:09.580
center is providing the necessary vital energy
to the left and right side equally. But supposing

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:21.380
you are a very futuristic person, you are
planning too much, thinking too much, then

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:28.380
what do you do? You use your right side too
much. As a result this moves this way.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:38.010
Also, the center now constricts. There is
no space in between left in the center for

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:48.529
the vital energy to flow. At this juncture
when you have moved too much from the left

00:10:48.529 --> 00:10:55.529
side, if any emotional disturbance comes in
or if you go to somebody who is practicing

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:07.480
black magic and all kinds of left-sided negative
things, or else you might get weak with an

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:15.490
accident or a shock, this breaks, and when
this center breaks, you lose your connection

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:25.340
with the center. The controlling agency that
is the central nervous system does not play

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:36.920
any more part. What happens to you is that
the growth of the cells become malignant -- means

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:47.340
they grow on their own. There is no relationship
to the growth of other cells.

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:54.340
For example, suddenly you'll find such a person
will have a nose increasing in size or you'll

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.140
find an ear increasing in size overpowering
all others or we can say that it becomes a

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:08.140
very dominating cell. This is a simple thing
that happens in cancer. Luckily, we have now

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:17.840
in Delhi University the understanding of Sahaja
Yoga very well because we have cured many

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:26.140
people of very -- somehow they were very highly
placed in life of cancer and other diseases.

00:12:27.779 --> 00:12:34.779
So they have accepted it for a doctorate,
and two doctors have got now their MD in two

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:43.800
subjects -- one was a psychosomatic disease.
One of the psychosomatic disease is cancer.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:51.070
There are so many others -- and another one
who has got his doctorate is in the physical

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:59.710
fitness and vulnerability. Now there are seven
other doctors in London who are doing research

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:10.620
on it (AIDS?) ....and its remarkable how after
realization you get out of the clutches of

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:17.130
physical sickness.
So what happens when the kundalini rises,

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:24.130
what she does, she pierces through this constricted
chakras, repairs it and brings it back to

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:34.230
its normal position, repairs it. And I have
seen our President of India getting cured

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:43.650
of his cancer in ten minutes time, that too
on the aeroplane. But it's easy to deal with

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:54.460
an Indian because they know what is a kundalini
and they know what is a saint. They will not

00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:03.520
easily take to these fake persons.
Though you are great seekers of a very high

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:14.130
quality, that understanding is there in India
more because they know more about the roots

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:23.740
and not about the tree, as you know more about
the tree. But it's such a barrier in understanding

00:14:24.779 --> 00:14:31.779
that three hundred years English ruled in
India, they could not learn a word. Today,

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:41.890
it's amazing to see such a difficult Sanskrit
verses about the Primordial Mother written

00:14:44.339 --> 00:14:51.339
by Adi Shankaracharya in the sixth century,
which many Indians will find it difficult

00:14:53.700 --> 00:15:00.700
to sing, it's so beautifully sung. The whole
mantras, as they say, are beautifully rendered

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:12.190
that even a well-equipped Brahmin cannot do,
by people who are not from India. They don't

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:20.050
even know Sanskrit language.
How this has happened is the manifestation

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:27.050
of the spirit. The manifestation of the spirit
gives you a dynamic personality. This dynamism

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:38.880
comes to you. You can sing whatever you like,
you can draw whatever you like, you can paint

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:45.350
whatever you like. There are so many people
who have become great orators and musicians,

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:52.350
especially in India, because my work mostly
has been in India. Of course, not that I am

00:15:55.080 --> 00:16:02.080
not concerned about the West. I have been,
as I told you, many a times in America.

00:16:03.649 --> 00:16:10.649
But to understand the reality, the first thing
we must know that money has nothing to do

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:21.540
with the living process. In America, you'll
be surprised, there has been a business offered

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:32.750
to me that the cool breeze that I blow, if
I can bottle it up, they can sell it. Everything

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:46.240
goes into a business proposition, and that's
why it is so difficult. For example, you have

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:57.990
seen near -- of course, I must say you are
great people that you have come to a program

00:17:00.149 --> 00:17:07.149
which has nothing to do with money -- it is
something really remarkable, I must say. But

00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:17.309
today if I was talking in India or if I was
visiting even a small village, there would

00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:24.669
have been minimum ten thousand people -- minimum
â€' and they would get all their realization.

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:36.750
The seeking is in the West, they are honest
seekers, but what to seek is the knowledge

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:49.090
which is in the East. It's something like
somebody have the teeth but no food, and those

00:17:49.429 --> 00:17:56.429
have food have no teeth on one side and on
the other side they have teeth but no food.

00:17:59.989 --> 00:18:06.989
It is such a simple thing to get rid of your
physical problems â€' is the easiest â€'

00:18:09.169 --> 00:18:16.169
and the second comes is the problem, as they
say, is of stress, which is a common disease

00:18:18.249 --> 00:18:25.249
in the West, is stress. What is the source
of stress within us? The source of stress

00:18:27.549 --> 00:18:34.549
is very simple that when we think -- I mean,
these days the amount of thinking we do -- first

00:18:36.909 --> 00:18:43.909
of all when I came to America, I was very
confused because of the choices you had. You

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:55.159
walk into any bathroom -- you better ask the
owner how do you operate, otherwise suddenly

00:18:55.159 --> 00:19:01.950
you'll find you have fallen into a big swimming
pool; suddenly it opens out for you. Or maybe

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:08.950
you open some sort of a shower and it becomes
a torrential rain -- so many choices which

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:20.820
maddens you completely.
What is there to choose about how you'll have

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:28.610
your scissors? As long as the scissor work,
it should be all right. It is so complicated

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:36.590
because so much of machinery -- they have
to produce so many things, so many varieties!

00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:43.909
Right from A to Z, whether it is a dress,
whether it is a hair-do, whether it is a carpet,

00:19:44.249 --> 00:19:51.249
or it is an ordinary thing which we call as
the handle of the car. Before getting into

00:19:53.489 --> 00:20:00.489
the car better ask the driver how it operates
otherwise you'll be lumped?[locked]. There

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:07.600
is no uniformity kept about these useless
material things and so the choices are so

00:20:08.379 --> 00:20:14.460
many. You go to a shop, you go mad -- you
don't know what to buy.

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:21.460
You just ask them, "I just need a, some, say,
powder for my body." "Now, which one you want?

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:29.110
This one? This one?" They'll give you thirty-two
things. You start wondering, "Oh, God! I have

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:36.110
only one body and thirty-two things." It is
so difficult to locate something that you

00:20:38.289 --> 00:20:43.730
need because you really don't know -- this
is natural, number one; this is absurd, number

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:50.450
two -- like that goes on and on and on, the
list for a small nonsensical thing like that.

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:55.320
Then tomorrow you go in the market, you find
that's gone out of market. Now another thirty-two

00:20:55.320 --> 00:21:02.320
things have come!
All such maddening things put you to thinking,

00:21:06.539 --> 00:21:13.539
"What should I do?" Then we have to plan out
everything in the future. It is so much so

00:21:16.929 --> 00:21:23.929
that by temperament, people have become futuristic.
Like they are sitting here listening to Me,

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:31.549
but they are thinking, "Now, how will I go
home? And what food I will be eating? Then

00:21:31.549 --> 00:21:38.039
what music I will have?" They are sitting
here at present but thinking about something

00:21:38.039 --> 00:21:45.039
....They are too much planning. They do not
know the plan of the Divine. They'll plan

00:21:46.179 --> 00:21:53.179
it out: rush, go forward, do this, go to the
airport. What has happened? The plane is delayed

00:21:54.279 --> 00:22:01.279
three hours! Why? Because their condition,
holiday cancelled. They had planned the holiday

00:22:03.279 --> 00:22:10.279
a year ahead. Poor things, you see, packed
everything to go somewhere. Holiday had to

00:22:11.499 --> 00:22:18.090
be cancelled because the planes are not moving.
So they sit down on the airport. See, they're

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:25.090
waiting for something to happen. Nothing happens;
they go off.

00:22:25.869 --> 00:22:32.869
But a yogi does not plan. He knows what's
going to happen. He does not bother. But supposing

00:22:39.669 --> 00:22:46.669
a yogi gets lost on the way. Then he thinks,
"All right, if I am lost there must be something

00:22:49.629 --> 00:22:56.590
here. I must see it. I am there with myself.
I am not lost. So let's enjoy." After all,

00:22:56.590 --> 00:23:03.590
what are we going to miss? It is something
one has to see that as we are so much stressed

00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:12.909
and under the domination of these watches,
that we all the time rush, rush, rush. Even

00:23:17.539 --> 00:23:24.539
the jobs that we do, we are supposed to rush.
You will rush as much as you like but the

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:33.840
problem is your mind also rushes with it and
the whole personality gets involved into it.

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:42.330
But if you have seen a wheel, the whole wheel
moves but the axis has to be steady. If the

00:23:45.129 --> 00:23:52.129
axis also starts moving, there is stress.
That's exactly what happens to us that we

00:23:54.970 --> 00:24:01.970
start moving with all the tensions that are
so-called -- I call them [unclear]. There

00:24:03.769 --> 00:24:09.659
is a center within us which we call as Swadhisthana
center. It's the second center which as you

00:24:09.659 --> 00:24:16.659
see is working out the Void. We call this
as the Void -- not the Zen Void -- but this

00:24:18.409 --> 00:24:25.409
is the Void, and this area is worked out by
the Swadhisthana which looks after the liver,

00:24:28.379 --> 00:24:35.379
the pancreas, spleen, the kidneys and part
of the intestine.

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:42.820
Intestines, physically or in the medical terminology
we can say, the aortic plexus manifested by

00:24:43.049 --> 00:24:50.049
this center works out. Now when the center
is doing this work in balance, it's all right.

00:24:54.929 --> 00:25:01.929
But when we think too much then the same center
has to convert the fat for the use of the

00:25:05.759 --> 00:25:12.759
brain to make it into gray cells. But when
we think too much then it neglects other important

00:25:18.899 --> 00:25:24.139
works which it has to do. So you get a liver
trouble.

00:25:24.139 --> 00:25:31.139
I find at least fifty percent people in the
West are suffering from liver trouble. They

00:25:33.269 --> 00:25:40.269
are not aware of it till they get to cirrhosis,
to skin troubles, this, that. They will not

00:25:40.419 --> 00:25:47.419
know that they have a bad liver, till they
have jaundice or other diseases which are

00:25:50.879 --> 00:25:57.879
caused by liver problems. Then we have people
who have lethargic livers also. So we have

00:26:00.679 --> 00:26:07.679
two types of people who have lethargic organs
or overactive organs. So this Swadhisthana

00:26:08.059 --> 00:26:15.059
Chakra cannot look after its duty in a balanced
way, creates a kind of an imbalance.

00:26:21.149 --> 00:26:28.149
So you neglect your pancreas, you get diabetes.
It's a funny idea that is now prevalent that

00:26:32.809 --> 00:26:39.070
we should not take sugar because â€' I
don't know from where it has come -- because

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:46.070
they think it causes you diabetes! It does
not. In India, in a village if you go, they

00:26:50.379 --> 00:26:57.379
have to put so much sugar in the tea that
the spoon must stand at right angles â€'

00:26:59.249 --> 00:27:05.139
otherwise they won't take â€' and nobody
has diabetes. They have never heard about

00:27:05.139 --> 00:27:12.139
it, never. No. "What is diabetes? What is
that?" they'll say. The reason is they don't

00:27:13.509 --> 00:27:20.509
think. They live for the moment. All right,
today is the work. Let's do this farming and

00:27:25.229 --> 00:27:32.229
come home and sleep off. They don't think
too much. We think about everything, plan

00:27:34.779 --> 00:27:41.779
out everything. Whatever is spontaneous also
we think about it!

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:50.229
Then the third thing that happens to you is
the trouble of the spleen. Now spleen is our

00:27:50.229 --> 00:27:56.269
time-keeper. It gives us a rhythm. As you
have seen the rhythm today, in the same way

00:27:56.269 --> 00:28:03.269
it's the rhythm of the life is kept by the
spleen. When you go into an emergency, then

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:11.070
the same spleen starts producing more red
blood corpuscles for your use. Now today's

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:19.220
life, as it is, is all the time shocking.
Early in the morning you read your newspaper.

00:28:23.609 --> 00:28:30.479
I think this is one of the worst habits, because
as soon as you see the newspaper, the first

00:28:30.479 --> 00:28:37.479
shock in the morning. Oh, God! So many dead.
Plane was crashed. War has started. Somebody

00:28:39.609 --> 00:28:46.330
fell from somewhere. All horrible things in
the newspaper because newspapers don't believe

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:52.450
in giving something good news!
If there will be peace and happiness what

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:59.450
will they publish, I don't know. So they want
to give shocking news so there is some sensation

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:07.570
in the body. It has happened to such an extent
that now unless and until the music is sensational,

00:29:08.099 --> 00:29:15.099
unless and until we get a shock all the time,
we do not react. Of course, the joy part is

00:29:16.159 --> 00:29:23.159
missing -- no doubt about it. So this poor
spleen doesn't understand -- this personality

00:29:24.929 --> 00:29:31.929
which is all the time under shock. Then you
get into our car and on the road there is

00:29:32.679 --> 00:29:39.679
a jam. Finish! You had to reach at such and
such time; now it's a jam. Now you are cursing

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:47.690
everything, sitting down there worrying.
Suddenly you find an accident. Then you go

00:29:48.599 --> 00:29:53.340
in the office or some place where you are
working. The boss has had a quarrel with his

00:29:53.340 --> 00:30:00.340
wife; so he comes and shouts at you -- another
shock. All the time you are facing very arrogant,

00:30:02.559 --> 00:30:08.609
horrible people. I mean, I myself am afraid
to go to shops or anything because suddenly

00:30:08.609 --> 00:30:15.609
they jump on you like a horse or sometimes
like a dog. God knows how they will react

00:30:16.929 --> 00:30:23.739
on you. You get a fright. What's the matter
with them? Why are they so shocking? But all

00:30:23.739 --> 00:30:30.739
of them are under stress and they are taking
it out on you. But the worst thing that happens

00:30:31.519 --> 00:30:38.519
with this spleen going crazy is that you get
blood cancer. Blood cancer is caused by hectic

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:50.450
life and for speedy life that we lead. Now
the blood pressure comes from the kidney.

00:30:55.259 --> 00:31:00.590
And like that so many things are caused by
one simple thing â€' that we think too

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:07.590
much. What is there to think? I just don't
understand. Whatever has to happen, will happen.

00:31:11.599 --> 00:31:18.599
By thinking, nothing is going to stop. By
thinking we have achieved nothing. If you

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:26.320
read Einstein who has developed the theory
of relativity, at the very outset he says

00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:33.389
that, "I was tired and I was lying down in
my garden, playing with soap bubbles and suddenly

00:31:35.359 --> 00:31:42.359
from somewhere unknown the theory of relativity
dawned upon me." Whatever we have is there.

00:31:46.239 --> 00:31:53.239
Whatever we have to find out comes from the
unknown, but thinking about it like mad just

00:31:54.469 --> 00:31:59.960
ruins us. But if I say, "Don't think," you
can't stop thinking. I know that because we

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:05.580
had a wonderful doctor in Switzerland. He
came and said, "Mother, do what You like.

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:12.320
You cut my throat, You cut my head but stop
this thinking. I am going mad." So he developed

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:17.570
a momentum of thinking, all the time thinking,
thinking, thinking.

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:23.070
Now what happens with the kundalini, when
the kundalini rises, passes through your Agnya

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:30.070
Chakra, you go beyond thinking. It is like
one wave of thought comes up and goes down,

00:32:33.719 --> 00:32:40.409
another wave of thought comes up and goes
down. In the center there is a little space;

00:32:40.409 --> 00:32:44.889
so one comes from the past and goes to the
future, another from the future to the past.

00:32:44.889 --> 00:32:51.679
In between there is a little space, and that
is the present. So when the kundalini rises,

00:32:51.679 --> 00:32:56.690
passes through this Agnya Chakra â€' the
one that gives you thought is the ego and

00:32:56.690 --> 00:33:03.690
the superego on both the side, as you can
see clearly -- they are sucked in; your karmas

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:12.090
are sucked in, your ego is sucked in, your
conditioning is sucked in and you stand at

00:33:12.259 --> 00:33:17.320
the present moment.
Then if you want to think, if you don't want

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:24.320
to think, you just sit down in complete silence
and enjoy yourself. You become in command.

00:33:25.049 --> 00:33:30.580
Like you are standing in the water, you are
afraid of getting drowned, but if you get

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:37.580
into the boat you enjoy the water. But supposing
you become a master swimmer, then you can

00:33:37.809 --> 00:33:44.539
save others also from the water. This is exactly
what happens when a Sahaja yogi establishes

00:33:44.539 --> 00:33:51.539
himself well, that he can give salvation to
so many and can save so many people. This

00:33:55.729 --> 00:34:02.729
is how we are going to emancipate.
Now the emotional side that we have is also

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:09.950
another extreme to which we bow? And with
the help of certain elements, you will be

00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:16.970
surprised: one candle can at least cure twenty-five
mad people at least. It's very simple. If

00:34:22.919 --> 00:34:29.919
you enlighten this light, then what happens
that enlightened light goes inside your left

00:34:34.379 --> 00:34:41.379
side and enlightens it completely and all
the negativity disappears in your collective

00:34:44.109 --> 00:34:51.109
subconscious. And you know who all suffer
from the left side of insanity, epilepsy,

00:34:52.139 --> 00:34:59.139
schizophrenia, all this nonsense. Because
you stand in the center -- you are neither

00:35:02.329 --> 00:35:07.940
on the left nor on the right -- if you are
in the center, you get rid of your emotional

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:13.839
problems.
Now, there are spiritual problems also. Before

00:35:13.839 --> 00:35:20.839
as we have, I told you, thinking problem,
we have also physical problems like over-exertion.

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:28.380
Now people are jogging. It's madness, I really
tell you. First, I thought there is some sort

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000
of an earthquake that the old, young, everybody
running. What is happening? What's wrong?

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Where are you running? Because you are over-exerting
yourself. What is the need to over-exert yourself?

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:51.230
Because now a concept is that if you are muscular
-- I don't know whatever is the concept, every

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:56.900
day changing, every day you find new, new
things -- then you become over-efficient;

00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:03.900
you become tired. It's absurd.
We have seen in history, say, we have got

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:10.920
the greatest statesman and the person who
saved us from this horrible Hitler was Churchill

00:36:11.039 --> 00:36:18.039
and what a fat man he was. He never did jogging
in his life! I mean, you must accept your

00:36:27.309 --> 00:36:32.660
body. It requires rest. For example, if I
start jogging, I'll be nowhere Myself because

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:39.660
I need a lot of water to protect the chakras
which work out the emancipation. To Me, that

00:36:41.049 --> 00:36:48.049
is much more important than becoming some
sort of a cinema actress. There are many cinema

00:36:48.079 --> 00:36:55.079
actresses. So what? What have they achieved?
How many people have they emancipated?

00:36:56.470 --> 00:37:03.470
So what is your ideal in life is to be decided
first. Do you want to be all the time slave

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:10.510
of your body? And I don't know what you get.
I mean, these days nobody looks at no one.

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:17.640
They are fed up now and you can't make out
one from another because they go to the same

00:37:18.529 --> 00:37:25.529
hairdresser. One fashion starts. I have to
think, "Is this he same person or somebody

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:32.700
else?" I mean, it is better to grow your beard
to look something different. I mean, there

00:37:36.619 --> 00:37:42.529
no way of making out who is who! Everybody
has the same hair dress, everybody has the

00:37:42.529 --> 00:37:49.529
same funny dress, everybody looking the same.
They have no personality. Tomorrow a wave

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:55.440
comes that you should put a plastic bag on
your head -- everybody will be moving with

00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:02.049
a plastic head.
We have to have a personality. Why should

00:38:02.049 --> 00:38:09.049
we dress up as everybody is dressing up? Such
a pressure. I know that because I have another

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:18.180
life which you know very well which is supposed
to be the high society -- so-called. And the

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:25.500
stupidest thing we discuss in that society.
Like they laugh at a woman if she is wearing

00:38:26.829 --> 00:38:33.829
something that was, say, belonging to sixties.
I mean, what's the harm? No, that's not modern!

00:38:37.869 --> 00:38:43.690
But what do you gain by becoming so modern
running with the fashion? What do you gain?

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:50.690
Now the fashion in England is to make holey
pants -- you make holes. Imagine that cold,

00:38:51.279 --> 00:38:58.069
horrible cold that you have. What is the need
to make holes in your pant to get all kinds

00:38:58.069 --> 00:39:03.930
of troubles? And then they'll have arthritis;
then they'll have this. First they had tight

00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:10.930
pants; so they developed varicose veins. Now
they are having such loose pants that they

00:39:11.089 --> 00:39:18.089
will develop arthritis. These people are managing
you. These manufacturers are befooling you.

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:28.940
This we cannot see because we have lost our
personality.

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:35.940
So we develop so many problems also because
we play into the hands of nonsenses. Now,

00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:43.910
say, Indian people have lived for so many
ages now so they have learnt all the lessons.

00:39:44.039 --> 00:39:50.770
If you go and tell them that you wear a holey
pant they'll say to/you, "Get lost! Sorry,

00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:57.059
sir. We know everything." Now they are painting
their hair and when they are painting their

00:39:57.059 --> 00:40:04.059
hair, people say, "Why are you painting their
hair?" "Oh, that's the fashion. What's wrong?"

00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:13.390
But people become blind in that. We had three
patients who became blind because they painted

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:19.680
their hair and some sort of a thing -- punk,
punk. They were three blind punks who came

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:26.680
to Sahaja Yoga.
Actually, you have to punch them to talk to

00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:35.510
them. This is the society in which we live.
Anybody who is sane will think I am mad. Like

00:40:37.019 --> 00:40:44.019
going to a lunatic asylum, you start thinking,
"Am I mad or they are mad?" That's how it

00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:52.829
creates a stress on us. Let us live with our
own dignity. You can see Mahatma Gandhi went

00:40:54.480 --> 00:41:01.480
for his round table conference. He wore his
dhoti. He didn't wear a three-piece suit and

00:41:02.289 --> 00:41:09.289
a tail coat -- that's another nonsense! Everybody
in England has to wear a tailcoat when they

00:41:10.289 --> 00:41:17.289
go to the Queen's party. But they can't afford.
So they borrow; some are tight, some are loose.

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:24.970
And when you see them there -- I mean, I have
been to many of them -- you can't recognize,

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:31.970
and they look so absurd and clownish that,
poor things, you know all these big, big ambassadors

00:41:34.089 --> 00:41:39.529
have to go about with that because it is supposed
to be a formal dress. I mean, what a formal

00:41:39.529 --> 00:41:45.630
dress it is.
All these things pressurize you. They make

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:52.160
you feel, "Oh, you must wear a dress like
this." Even when you go to some guru, he says,

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:59.160
"All right, you all have to wear," say, "orange
dress." So you are forced into it; you have

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:07.500
to wear the orange dress. From where are you
going to manage -- getting rid of all this

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:17.660
nonsense of forcing you to do this and forcing
you to do that. But here you are so individualistic

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:25.470
and here you are a down-to-earth personality,
Its not that anybody says you have to do it

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:35.950
but you just do it because we have our own
personality. Individualism means personality.

00:42:37.539 --> 00:42:44.539
And that is what when it is lost, you feel
also your guilt and your stress. That's possible

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:55.940
that you stand on in your own glory, in your
own personality, in your own understanding

00:42:55.940 --> 00:43:02.940
of your spiritual value. So when that starts,
another style of movement comes in, like hippies.

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:14.190
We become like a primitive person, you become
like a hippy, you go about like a hippy, you

00:43:21.279 --> 00:43:28.279
wear a funny dress, become a primitive personality
and think, "Oh, I have done very great thing."

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:37.000
I had some hippies with Me, I told you yesterday.
So I asked them, "Why do you dress up like

00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:46.900
this?" They said, "We want this kind of culture."
I said, "This is primitive." They said, "We

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:52.359
want to be primitive." I said, "You cannot
be. Your brain is modern. Just by wearing

00:43:52.359 --> 00:43:59.359
these primitive things you cannot be. Accept
it, accept yourself. And now you have your

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:10.650
realization and it will work out."
So with all these stresses on us -- thinking

00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:33.490
too much, futuristic personality â€' you
develop the stress. Now what happens when

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:42.240
kundalini rises, you are beyond thought. That's
called in Sanskrit as Nirvichar Samadhi -- thoughtless

00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:52.670
awareness. You are fully aware -- on the contrary,
you are more aware â€' but you are in thoughtless

00:44:54.930 --> 00:45:01.930
awareness. Now when I see this carpet in thoughtless
awareness, I don't think. I don't think because

00:45:02.329 --> 00:45:08.210
if I have to think, "Oh, Baba, this is my
carpet. Now I have not insured it. If somebody

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:12.260
will run away with it, then what will happen?"
I won't be able to give any speech or anything.

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:19.260
I'll be worried about the carpet only.
But when I look at this carpet, I don't think.

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:28.200
Only the joy of the creation of this carpet
is just pouring into Me; a beautiful blissful

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:37.880
feeling, that's all. I am not thinking. Like
a very still beautiful lake which has no ripples

00:45:44.099 --> 00:45:51.099
reflects all the beauty that is around it,
fully. A complete joy is reflected in a mind

00:45:53.420 --> 00:46:00.420
which is absolutely still, not reacting, not
accepting, just seeing, witnessing. And this

00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:11.420
witness state comes into you and you become
a tranquil and a peaceful personality.

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:20.440
Such peace that such a person, wherever he
goes, wherever he walks, a peaceful atmosphere

00:46:21.089 --> 00:46:28.089
prevails. The nature, the elements all react
to such a personality. Just talking about

00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:37.640
peace or giving prizes of peace, you do not
feel peace. I know of people who have got

00:46:39.579 --> 00:46:46.579
Nobel Prizes of peace are horrid. They look
like some mad dogs. If you have to talk to

00:46:50.099 --> 00:46:56.240
them, take the barge pole in between. Don't
know when you'll be hit with the prize they

00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:03.240
have got. And you may have to pay very dearly
for meting such a personality who is supposed

00:47:04.019 --> 00:47:11.019
to be the foundation of peace and you find
it's a fountain of violence. This is the situation

00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:22.670
today that we are placed in a society which
artificially expresses itself. There

00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:21.980
is nothing genuine, nothing innate ...
