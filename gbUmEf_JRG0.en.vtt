00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.940
I must thank Warren for such a nice speech
that he has given and all the Australians

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.290
the way they have taken to Sahaja Yoga. They
are all westernized in every sense of the

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:25.350
word. There’s something about them where
I feel that they are very quick at knowing

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:41.300
the truth. I don’t know how. They are not
that adamant against the truth. This opening

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:52.209
somehow I found.
Seeking is everywhere very strong I feel America,

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:59.829
England, Europe, everywhere the seeking is
very strong no doubt. There are seekers. Of

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:07.270
course there is also a fashion of seeking
apart from that. There are real seekers, no

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:18.780
doubt about it. And as he has said that ego
orientation is one of the characters in the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:27.470
West. That also one would say that it is more
now in the developing countries because they

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:39.609
are supposed to be developed. But the way
these people have a special capacity to see

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:47.810
the truth, see the truth is a very big thing.
Even if you are a developing country or a

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:59.220
developed country, if you cannot perceive
the truth, you cannot assimilate it. That

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:07.940
perception some how was surprising, I found
in Australia, was surprising.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:17.210
Now for example in England I worked very hard,
no doubt, years together. People are hard

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:25.000
nuts, you can say. Once they are cracked they
are wonderful scholars. They know how to completely

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.430
sort it out with their brains, everything
is there. But there are very few people who

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.860
do that.
At the time of Christ you can see how many

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:45.949
could recognize Him? Not even one, not even
one, believe Me. Except for John the Baptist,

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:51.009
of course he was a realized soul. So, I mean
he should not be in the question. The rest

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:57.930
of them were just sticking on to Him somehow,
as He said that you stick on to Me for some

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:07.740
time. And till He got His resurrection, they
could not see the truth at all. To perceive

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:17.630
it itself is a very big blessing I think.
And I do not know why people cannot perceive

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.500
it because I cannot go to the other side and
see Myself what’s the problem is?

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:32.119
For example in this country or in the West,
on the whole, the false people have come.

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:40.339
They have minted money. They have palaces
and they have huge big aircrafts and they

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:47.860
have material things and I mean immense wealth
they have collected out of the people who

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:57.020
are supposed to be westernized. But Sahaja
Yoga, you’ll be amazed even to crack a journalist

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:05.619
is a headache. A journalist doesn’t have
time for Me at all. It’s impossible to go

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:14.439
and talk to any newspaper person, leave alone
any television or anything like that. Radio

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:22.329
is an impossibility. Can you imagine, with
all these facilities God has given you, for

00:04:22.329 --> 00:04:29.240
spreading the message fast for the wider world?
But it is impossible you can’t talk to them,

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:36.979
but let some, say a fake person coming, he’s
there. He’s on the televisions, he’s on

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:45.090
the radio, Pope will come and see him. Your
Archbishop of Canterbury will go and touch

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:52.099
his feet. And he is a fake, absolute fake.
Why?

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:58.039
Only thing is that we are very money oriented.
They come out with their money. They provide

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:05.269
lot of money for publication. They take money
and they use it. I mean if Christ was to be

00:05:05.269 --> 00:05:10.789
here I tell you He would have no place even
a mike would’ve been difficult for Him being

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:18.199
a carpenter’s Son.
Sometimes I find it an impossible situation

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:27.180
to tell them that after all how are you impressed
by these people who are taking such a lot

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:40.799
of money out of you in the name of God? One
has to think about it that it is so money

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:47.749
oriented that any man who comes with money
impresses people. Amazing in the country,

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:54.180
which is so affluent, they are suffering from
affluence, that’s their disease. And there

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:03.499
they are impressed by people who are using
money as a purpose of propaganda of God Almighty.

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:06.499
Imagine the absurdity. I don’t know what
happens to their brains?

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:18.169
This time I went to Edinburgh and people told
Me that most of the young people are disciples

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:25.169
of a person who will not even be liked by
the servants of India, take it from Me. Even

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:31.029
our servants will take money to go to him.
He doesn’t know good English, even up to

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:38.129
that point you can say. He doesn’t know
anything, how to talk to people. He says he

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:43.370
is fourteen year old which he is not. He’s
married an eight-year-old girl. I mean all

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:49.569
kinds of things. He asked for Rolls Royces,
he has fifty-eight, he wanted a fifty ninth

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:51.699
so they starved themselves and collected money
and gave him the 59th. You the English have

00:06:51.699 --> 00:07:03.049
done it, take it from Me.
Can you believe this stupidity? They have

00:07:03.049 --> 00:07:06.129
starved themselves and have done it. They
are seekers, seekers of what? Of giving Rolls

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:16.999
Royce to this man? I mean I just can’t understand
how can it go to that stupid level? That’s

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:24.139
what I feel that in Australia people have
not accepted anyone like that. They have not

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:28.949
accepted. They are still you see, they did
this, they did that, He did everything – Warren,

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:34.069
[Bah Kari?] this that. He did everything that
is possible under the Sun. They know all the

00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:40.669
gurus, all the gurus have gone to Australia
and they didn’t accept anyone. That’s

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:46.589
the main point. All the time they are shaky
like this and as soon as they saw the truth

00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:55.379
they jumped on to it. We have to understand
that Spirit cannot be related to money by

00:07:55.379 --> 00:08:02.729
any chance. It has nothing to do.
Christ was a Son of a carpenter. Just think

00:08:02.729 --> 00:08:18.059
of that. He, the owner of all the properties
of the world, was born as a poor man. And

00:08:18.059 --> 00:08:28.729
how can you relate this to money? I just fail
to understand and this little truth Australians

00:08:28.729 --> 00:08:38.880
knew and I wish the English, the Americans
and the Europeans take out their attention

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:46.459
from money and the comfort so called that
money gives you. I am sure, I am sure this

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:50.949
country will rise. It has to rise. It has
to rise.

00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:57.399
Unless and until England rises, the world
cannot rise. This is a definite thing. Absolutely

00:08:57.399 --> 00:09:03.519
it is as definite as anything. England has
to rise first because it is the heart of the

00:09:03.519 --> 00:09:10.079
Universe. And the English Sahaja Yogis have
to also awaken to their responsibilities,

00:09:10.079 --> 00:09:19.430
which is very important. I will give all My
blood, all My energies, all that is possible

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:28.430
under the sun to awaken this country to its
responsibility as a Spiritual nature, as the

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:40.290
Spiritual being, as the Spiritual heart, as
the donor of blood, all over. And this is

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:53.339
what saddens Me to see how people are drowning
themselves into some sort of a illusion and

00:09:53.339 --> 00:10:03.060
are not being able to see the truth.
Now as he has told you, that Sahaja Yoga is

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:10.380
fantastic, no doubt about, it because you
are fantastic yourself. You are the Spirit;

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:17.000
you are The Spirit. You have to just become
the Spirit is the point. Once you become the

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.880
Spirit you are dynamic; not dynamic but you
are the master of everything. You can control

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:34.240
things, you can enjoy everything, you become
blissful. You can do such a lot because you

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:41.630
are the Spirit and you have become the Spirit.
It is as simple as that. God Almighty has

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:49.759
placed this Power within us at the triangular
bone, it exits there.

00:10:49.759 --> 00:10:57.009
It has to just rise and give you a real baptism
by which you feel your Spirit first time where

00:10:57.009 --> 00:11:05.019
it flows like cool breeze in the hand. As
simple as that.

00:11:05.019 --> 00:11:11.310
Now this happening is a very very strong happening.
For some people it’s a very strong happening

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:18.600
– first day, because you are seekers. You
are seekers. Believe Me you are seekers of

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:29.019
thousands of years. Born in this country to
get what you have been seeking. But what do

00:11:29.019 --> 00:11:34.190
we expect?
I wish he had not mentioned you the word puja

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:39.759
because it can again give you the thing that
it is sort of a some one-person business.

00:11:39.759 --> 00:11:48.009
It’s not that. Warren says puja because
all these centers have got Deities. Especially

00:11:48.009 --> 00:11:59.699
this center is the center of Christ. You have
to make these Deities within you happy and

00:11:59.699 --> 00:12:06.009
awaken them. And that awakening must take
place; you must understand where these Deities

00:12:06.009 --> 00:12:10.209
exist. And these deities are nothing but are
incarnations of God’s aspect like you can

00:12:10.209 --> 00:12:19.149
say Christ incarnated, who is placed at this
point where the optic chasma is between the

00:12:19.149 --> 00:12:30.250
pituitary and pineal body. And when Christ
is awakened, when He gets into action within

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:40.550
you, then your two things that are shown there
– the blue and the yellow, the blue is the

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:50.430
superego and yellow is the ego, are sucked
in. Means all your karmas, all your doings,

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:57.829
your ego and superego are sucked in.
That means He has crucified Himself in such

00:12:57.829 --> 00:13:07.769
a way that He has made within us a passage.
When He is awakened, He sucks that and all

00:13:07.769 --> 00:13:12.659
our sins. Sins is nothing but conditionings
you can say and other things that we have

00:13:12.659 --> 00:13:20.560
got within us. Everything is sucked in. When
it is sucked in, then only the Kundalini can

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:29.469
rise above that.
Now Sahaja Yogis know that Christ is one of

00:13:29.469 --> 00:13:39.300
the aspects – is the Son aspect. And there
are aspects where He is a creator, where He

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:54.879
is a sustainer, where He is a Master you can
say and where He is the witness. All these

00:13:54.879 --> 00:14:00.459
things, people never gave chance to Him to
speak. Now I’ve been speaking for seven

00:14:00.459 --> 00:14:08.899
years in this country. But for four years
I could’ve hardly spoken even twice or thrice

00:14:08.899 --> 00:14:15.879
because I was struggling with six of them.
So we can imagine you gave Him only three

00:14:15.879 --> 00:14:22.120
years or say at the most four years to speak
about these things and how many things He

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:28.430
has spoken and how many these people who were
supposed to be his disciples have written

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:36.500
down, God alone knows. And whatever they have
communicated is so limited that it has created

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:45.639
problems for you. But every sentence, every
word that He has spoken is so deep and you

00:14:45.639 --> 00:14:53.250
can only understand it when you get your Realization.
When there is no light what’s the use of

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:57.779
telling you there are these pictures; there
are flowers there and this picture there and

00:14:57.779 --> 00:15:05.180
this is the color of the paper that is put
on these walls, what’s the use? There is

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:12.100
no light to see. When you get the light I
don’t have to tell you as He said, “The

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:19.189
knowledge start [tickling?] within, automatically.”
You are that Spirit and unless and until that

00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:25.850
Spirit is manifested what else are you seeking?
A guru says, “I do this thing, I do that

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:33.870
thing.” All right so what? What about us?
What do we have got it from this temple? What

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:42.089
has he given us? You must find out. His disciples
are there. For example they went to the Ganeshpuri

00:15:42.089 --> 00:15:46.009
this thing and there everybody was jumping.
‘Ha, ha, ha, hu, hu’, taking out clothes

00:15:46.009 --> 00:15:50.469
and I don’t know and then taking all kinds
of drugs and this and that.

00:15:50.469 --> 00:16:00.480
For jumping you don’t pay. You can jump
without paying. And drugs also they had to

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:07.899
pay. Even without payment he could not produce
any drugs. So one should understand that this

00:16:07.899 --> 00:16:18.850
kind of a nonsense and down foolery is mockery
of yourself. Is just mockery. You are that

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:26.379
dignified, magnificent thing, which is the
Spirit. And you are befooled by these people.

00:16:26.379 --> 00:16:39.870
You should see, this much at least, that anyone
who has given any powers to another person

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:45.379
should be accepted, isn’t it?
I mean supposing somebody says that a particular

00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:50.659
thing is very good. Say – ‘this kind of
a lamp is very good.’ Then you see at least

00:16:50.659 --> 00:16:57.730
how it works? If the one who says, “You
see the lamp”. You must at least see the

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:07.679
disciples of these gurus and then decide.
This is very much lacking. Like sheep they

00:17:07.679 --> 00:17:16.159
follow and they fall into horrible ditches.
Doesn’t matter as far as God is concerned

00:17:16.159 --> 00:17:22.770
He’s bent upon saving His creation. He’s
bent upon it. He will do it whatever you may

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:28.080
try to destroy. You try your level best to
destroy yourself and destroy the world that

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:36.490
He has created. But He is all-powerful. He
is all forgiving. He is all compassion. He

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:43.919
is going to save you whatever you may try.
Try your level best. But for a change why

00:17:43.919 --> 00:17:50.799
not try to save yourself and save others?
This is what one has to seek.

00:17:50.799 --> 00:17:59.159
Now when listening to Me also you should doubt
because you are in free condition. You are

00:17:59.159 --> 00:18:07.090
not mesmerized by Me. If I was a real mesmerizer,
you could not have asked Me any questions.

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:11.450
You all would’ve fallen straight at My feet.
There would have been no questioning at all

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:17.520
because there are thousands who are doing
that stupidly. But you are free, you are free

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:23.520
to doubt, no doubt. But doubting what? One
has to think, “What are we doubting?”

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:32.580
As he said, “I am the most expensive person.”
[IT MAKES ME LAUGH?] Because you cannot pay

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:39.870
for it. It’s so expensive that all your
banks drained out cannot pay for it. All your

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:45.140
wealth that you have here so called wealth
that you have accumulated cannot purchase

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:54.520
it. It’s so expensive. It is invaluable.
Is the richest thing in the world that cannot

00:18:54.520 --> 00:19:02.830
be purchased by any riches. It is, no doubt
but is not exclusive. It’s meant for everyone.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:08.730
The doors are open now for everyone.
Now don’t you worry. Don’t count your

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:17.559
sins and your guilts and this and that, forget
that. It’s the grace that itself is anxious

00:19:17.559 --> 00:19:24.770
as I told you and you all ought to get your
realization and should grow into it. You will

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:30.960
enjoy the complete bliss of your being which
is so beautiful. Like a diamond it is sparkling.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:40.049
Only thing, you have to just unveil it. And
that is not difficult for you, not at all

00:19:40.049 --> 00:19:44.529
difficult.
Now the things that he has told about the

00:19:44.529 --> 00:19:51.340
physical side, that’s the minimum that should
happen. That’s the minimum of minimum that

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:59.939
should happen to anyone who comes to Sahaja
Yoga. Because if you are the temple of God

00:19:59.939 --> 00:20:09.250
then it has to be cleansed before God is established
within you, before the Deity is sparkled in

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:13.679
you, it has to be cleansed. So the cleansing
takes place automatically; don’t have to

00:20:13.679 --> 00:20:19.059
worry about that, that’s automatic. Even
a thing like cancer can be cured in no time.

00:20:19.059 --> 00:20:23.500
A cancer can only be cured by Sahaja Yoga,
by nothing else take it from Me. It cannot

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:30.399
be cured. It may be that you may loose your
throat, sometimes nose, sometimes ears and

00:20:30.399 --> 00:20:37.730
you may continue with the doctors but with
cancer you live in one body and get cured.

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:44.200
And there are some cancer patients here, sitting
down. They perhaps do not know and some of

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:51.500
them know also; have been completely cured
by Sahajayoga. The reason is that your body

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:57.860
is just ready, is waiting for that moment
when you get the light. As soon as you get

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:01.919
the light immediately you know where is the
problem and you start correcting it. Once

00:21:01.919 --> 00:21:08.820
you start correcting it, it’s not you. But
this Power corrects it. Imagine this light

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:16.149
not only enlightens the room but also corrects
it. Think of such a thing that is God’s

00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:24.570
love. That it loves you, it coordinates everything,
it makes you cooperate and it blesses you

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:29.820
with the highest.
This all pervading power has been described

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:34.590
in the scriptures. Everybody said, “There
is all pervading power.” Now you might say,

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:40.990
“Where is it? We can’t see. How are we
to believe?” Now as I always give an example

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:46.980
of a television, which I saw first time when
it came to India. That in a village people

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:51.890
were told that there is an ether around us
and you can, there are lots of dramas and

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:58.669
music and plays going on. They said, “How
can we believe it?” So they just put the

00:21:58.669 --> 00:22:03.919
television to the mains and it started working
fantastically. And they were amazed, they

00:22:03.919 --> 00:22:09.679
had to believe that is coming, there’s no
other connection, is coming, through this.

00:22:09.679 --> 00:22:17.860
That’s what it is. You are an instrument.
Exquisitely made, beautifully, delicately

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:24.279
constructed. Just for this happening. Of course
you’ve ruined it. So many have ruined it

00:22:24.279 --> 00:22:29.880
no doubt; you have tried in your childishness.
Doesn’t matter; makes no difference. You

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:35.590
will get your realization. You should have
no worry on that point. That’s My worry.

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:40.640
Once you get your realization then you can
give realizations to others.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:46.840
Now about the lady that he told who got well
and was very sick. I must tell you that first

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:55.500
of all she was very very sick and she was
about to die. I was not there at that time.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:23:02.539
Actually these people were there. Warren didn’t
want to say out of humility I think.

00:23:02.539 --> 00:23:10.570
These people went there and put My photograph
there and gave her vibrations. And she came

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:16.990
to consciousness and they were surprised.
The one, who was going to die, has been declared

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:24.230
– going to die very soon, came to consciousness.
And they then thought there’s something

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:33.100
great about it. Then they came away. Still
the doctors couldn’t believe it. And the

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:38.539
relations also said, “How can that be? What
is it?” She again went into coma, when I

00:23:38.539 --> 00:23:43.990
was there.
But a gentleman, who was related to her, was

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:50.990
connected with newspapers. Some how it worked
out and he published a lot that we have proof

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:55.990
to believe that Sahaja Yoga can cure people.
And that’s how it started and that’s how

00:23:55.990 --> 00:24:04.330
worked out. But the first thing was done by
Warren and company, not by Mother.

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:12.760
So they themselves had the powers to cure,
to give realization, to do all that I can

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:19.189
do. And that’s what it is that once you
are enlightened you should manifest your own

00:24:19.189 --> 00:24:25.700
powers. Otherwise the rest of the thing is
nothing but a joke. You jump or you stand

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:30.779
on your heads. That you can always do what
is so great about it? If it is some God’s

00:24:30.779 --> 00:24:37.399
grace has to come upon you then you must manifest
something special. Not only curing but raising

00:24:37.399 --> 00:24:43.529
of the Kundalini.
Now this triangular bone is called as sacrum,

00:24:43.529 --> 00:24:48.720
meaning sacred bone that means these people,
who have given the name to it long time back,

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:55.500
must have known that this is a sacred bone.
Otherwise why did they call it sacrum? But

00:24:55.500 --> 00:25:01.730
I think that knowledge was lost in Latin,
in Norway must have been, the knowledge was

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:06.600
lost and that’s how they do not know, they
just call it the sacrum. Now you can see with

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:13.340
your naked eyes, the pulsation of the Kundalini
and rising. You can feel the pulsation on

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:19.590
your head when it comes there and afterwards
you find complete it has become quiet. As

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:24.439
soon as becomes quiet you start feeling in
the hands. Of course this center should be

00:25:24.439 --> 00:25:28.189
all right. If this center is not all right
you don’t feel in the hands but you feel

00:25:28.189 --> 00:25:35.539
on the head. This center is to be corrected
then, then you can feel in your hands.

00:25:35.539 --> 00:25:42.059
Now this you can do yourself when you are
realized. Its not only Me, you can do it also.

00:25:42.059 --> 00:25:49.580
I mean in, say in Australia say, we can say
if there are two thousand people who have

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:59.360
got Realization, I could’ve given only to
about five hundred, the rest are done by these

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.610
people only.
You people can give Realization. But difference

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:09.860
in Australia and here is – now if an English
Sahaja Yogi tries to talk to someone about

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:16.039
Sahaja Yoga, the person says, “You are not
supposed to discuss religion”. I mean that’s

00:26:16.039 --> 00:26:21.029
an etiquette, it is supposed to be. You can’t
discuss religion. This you can’t discuss

00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:30.769
God. So they run away. Hard to get even two
people in, to talk about Sahaja Yoga. This

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:35.467
is the problem otherwise all of them are capable
of giving realization.

00:26:35.967 --> 00:26:46.127
Now Douglas is sitting here. Talk to David
Frawl. I knew that he was doing TM and he

00:26:46.127 --> 00:26:53.707
told him also. And here talking to him, David
Frawl feeling heated up, absolutely boiling.

00:26:53.707 --> 00:27:00.666
And he was perspiring, is a fact. And when
he came to the thing, now he’s got Realization.

00:27:00.666 --> 00:27:07.406
He is giving Realization to people when he
got cured. I mean you don’t need much brains

00:27:07.406 --> 00:27:17.597
for that. You don’t need any accessories
of the world, which are regarded as very practical.

00:27:17.597 --> 00:27:24.207
I would say that Douglas at that time was
one of the most impractical person. He had

00:27:24.207 --> 00:27:30.097
taken drugs and he had taken all these things;
there are many who were like this. Some were,

00:27:30.097 --> 00:27:34.857
some had come from lunatic asylum and they
started giving realization.

00:27:34.857 --> 00:27:39.957
The other day in Norridge there were three
persons sitting in front row and were all

00:27:39.957 --> 00:27:43.737
shaking up before Me. I said, “Now from
where these have come?” I asked them, “From

00:27:43.737 --> 00:27:48.936
where they have come.” They said, “We
have come from lunatic asylum and we are certified

00:27:48.936 --> 00:27:54.847
mad people.” I said, “You are certified
and you are here. How are you here? I mean

00:27:54.847 --> 00:27:59.227
if you are certified mad you are not supposed
to be here”. They said, “One person came

00:27:59.227 --> 00:28:05.487
to My program and got well. So the authorities
have sent us here for getting well, so we

00:28:05.487 --> 00:28:12.176
are here.” And I won’t be surprised that
these three may start a Sahaja Yoga center

00:28:12.176 --> 00:28:18.936
in Norridge, very soon. But I said, “You
better return the certificates to them”.

00:28:18.936 --> 00:28:26.117
It is such a great thing you can imagine certified
mad people getting Realization and starting

00:28:26.117 --> 00:28:30.237
a Sahaja Yoga center.
There are people who were cancer patients,

00:28:30.237 --> 00:28:37.156
who got realization and have started a Sahaja
Yoga center. So you can imagine how tremendous

00:28:37.156 --> 00:28:45.457
are the Powers of God and how carefully He
has made us to be that Spirit. We have no

00:28:45.457 --> 00:28:53.436
idea; we have no esteem of ourselves. We do
not know what great thing we are and what

00:28:53.436 --> 00:28:59.217
we have to achieve and what we have to enjoy.
Actually He is such a gracious Father, He’s

00:28:59.217 --> 00:29:06.747
so generous and He’s so loving that He wants
to share His joy. He wants you to enter into

00:29:06.747 --> 00:29:15.967
the kingdom of God. And to enjoy that bliss,
that happiness, that freedom which has been

00:29:15.967 --> 00:29:22.237
promised to you in all the scriptures. It’s
as simple as that. It is so simple that I

00:29:22.237 --> 00:29:28.227
don’t know how I’ve given four hundred
lectures about such a simple thing like Self

00:29:28.227 --> 00:29:32.637
-Realization. And they say they are all wonderful
and one is better than the other.

00:29:32.637 --> 00:29:36.897
But today’s lecture must be, has been a
more of an introduction because according

00:29:36.897 --> 00:29:44.026
to them there are many new people today. Whatever
it is I would like to allow you to ask Me

00:29:44.026 --> 00:29:50.416
some questions. And everybody should admit
that new people should ask questions and Sahaja

00:29:50.416 --> 00:29:55.566
Yogis should not feel upset about it. Because
sometimes you know questions can be very aggressive

00:29:55.566 --> 00:30:00.117
and they get upset. But there should be nothing
to worry about it. Its all right your Mother

00:30:00.117 --> 00:30:04.906
knows how to handle everything. So nothing
to be upset about it because they have already

00:30:04.906 --> 00:30:11.406
passed [ ? ] saying that no questions will
be allowed to ask to Mother. See if I am a

00:30:11.406 --> 00:30:17.467
Mother, if I have patience, if I have love
then you should not worry. You should not

00:30:17.467 --> 00:30:23.156
worry about it at all. I have to manage all
of them. Sometimes in the beginning everybody

00:30:23.156 --> 00:30:26.286
is like that.
Just now Warren has told you how he was because

00:30:26.286 --> 00:30:30.507
he was made to sleep on the cement. I mean
he was not made but he slipped out you see.

00:30:30.507 --> 00:30:37.186
And next day he was down with very great agitation,
he was going back to Australia. But I caught

00:30:37.186 --> 00:30:42.737
hold of his shirt, I said, “Can you wait
for sometime lets see it might work out?”

00:30:42.737 --> 00:30:48.306
So it is like that. It’s a very sweet thing
you know and I know that children have a right

00:30:48.306 --> 00:30:53.097
to get angry with Mother but not too much
of it. Because after all you are here for

00:30:53.097 --> 00:30:58.477
a purpose and that purpose must be fulfilled.
That’s why I am here.

00:30:58.477 --> 00:31:05.217
May God bless you all.
I would like to have really some questions

00:31:05.217 --> 00:31:10.066
because sometimes these questions also help
a lot for Me to understand what’s the problem

00:31:10.076 --> 00:31:25.897
is. Can I have some questions please? Yes
please.

00:31:25.877 --> 00:31:35.447
Question: [Not Audible]
Yes, Yes. What Warren has told you is a caution

00:31:35.457 --> 00:31:43.307
but I have, I know so many people who have
got Rrealization without any return. [NOT

00:31:43.317 --> 00:31:54.377
AUDIBLE] I know so many people [NOT AUDIBLE].
Warren has given you a thing of caution because

00:31:54.427 --> 00:32:02.136
he has seen some people that they drop out
because the Kundalini comes down and they

00:32:02.136 --> 00:32:08.017
find little frustrating. But I have all the
patience and you should have patience but

00:32:08.017 --> 00:32:16.287
I haven’t met anybody who has been with
us, doesn’t feel it. You may not feel the

00:32:16.287 --> 00:32:22.136
vibrations but there are, Realization is there.
Because when you put your hand on your head

00:32:22.136 --> 00:32:27.287
you definitely get the cool breeze coming
out and you give Realizations to others, that’s

00:32:27.287 --> 00:32:31.376
the proof of it.
There’s someone who was always caught up

00:32:31.376 --> 00:32:35.057
on all the fingers, he feels the tingling
all the time. But he gives Realization to

00:32:35.057 --> 00:32:38.147
so many people. He has given himself, he’s
caught up.

00:32:38.147 --> 00:32:43.947
Its something like this, you can say even
if it’s the fifth hand car it moves, once

00:32:43.947 --> 00:32:50.407
started. You go on repairing it, but it moves,
no doubt it moves. So nothing to be upset

00:32:50.407 --> 00:32:52.506
about it.
[NOT AUDIBLE]

00:32:52.506 --> 00:33:10.557
When do we? Right now? Me-Me? I don’t know
how many thousand years. I was born with it.

00:33:10.557 --> 00:33:19.967
Yes very much, very much, very much, very
much realized. I was born as a real great

00:33:20.057 --> 00:33:26.927
great Grand Mother, I tell you. I knew everything
about [IT or HER] from My very childhood.

00:33:26.982 --> 00:33:34.143
I was very conscious, over alert.
[NOT AUDIBLE]

00:33:34.143 --> 00:33:42.183
Repeat! [NOT AUDIBLE]
Rare thing beware, beware yes beware, beware,

00:33:42.193 --> 00:33:58.460
beware, yes true. Yes, it’s correct, correct
that’s true. [NOT AUDIBLE] Yes I must tell

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:05.840
you about that. You see the people who have
written about Kundalini. I started knowing

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:09.889
about them that there are people who have
written about Kundalini. And I was amazed

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:14.710
because they are absolutely ignorant, not
only ignorant but stupid people. I don’t

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:19.360
know from where did they get this knowledge
because people do not know about this, they

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.780
started printing it. Perhaps anything you
can print and isn’t it?

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:27.670
I’ve seen such a big book where the fellow
doesn’t know where the Kundalini is; he

00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:33.080
says it is in the stomach. Then he says it
is in the back, he doesn’t know anything.

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:42.220
Now the trouble is this knowledge was a very
secret knowledge, thousands of years back

00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:49.090
and it started descending – this knowledge
to people very slowly like on a tree there’s

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:54.640
only one flower or two flowers maybe.
Now in the sixth century, actually Christ

00:34:54.640 --> 00:35:00.900
talked about it quite a lot. And other people
like Moses and all these people have talked

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:06.110
about it. But the ones, who wrote, never got
anything. [THEY HAVE?] Perhaps so they wrote

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:10.640
it in a very mystical way like, ‘I’ll
appear before you like tongues of flames or

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:20.270
the tree of fire’ and all that – indicative
of all that. But it so happened that in the

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:26.600
sixth century somebody in India called as
Adi Shankaracharya – He was actually Buddha

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:32.710
reborn, He started talking about it. Self-realization,
of course Buddha talked about it. Then He

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:36.560
started telling about these, all these nadis
and everything He described.

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:43.680
But there is a poet in India whose name is
Markdandeya who has written about this. They

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:53.190
say he was living in India about say ten thousand
years back – this poet, about that time.

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:59.000
So this knowledge was known to people but
was not put down on the paper, was not circulated,

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.440
was not for en masse.
Now these people who are writing about it

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:10.330
have no knowledge, have no authority and they
have tried these tricks. Actually this is

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:18.720
the holiest of holy – the sanctum sanctorum
within you. And a person who himself is authorized

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:25.260
by God can only do it. Authorized by God not
by any say theological college or all these

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:32.360
things. It cannot. God should authorize – like
Christ, like you can say John the Baptist,

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:36.940
like Moses, like that somebody authorized
by God can only do it.

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:42.510
So these people tried the tricks, which are
unauthorized, and they got results because

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:52.580
there’s a deity sitting in the last chakra
called as Mooladhara chakra, which is the

00:36:52.580 --> 00:37:04.540
root – support of the root. That chakra,
He tries to excite your sympathetic by that

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:08.760
and when the sympathetic is excited you get
all these heats and this and that and the

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:13.850
boils and all. So it is not meant for people
who have no holiness in them. You have to

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:18.490
be a holy person, who should be able to raise
the Kundalini, you should be cleansed otherwise

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:22.770
you cannot do this work.
While there are people who are connecting

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:29.360
Kundalini, imagine, with sex. I mean it’s
an absurd thing; She’s your Mother. She

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:35.290
is your Mother and has been your Mother all
these ages and it’s like having a dirty

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:40.320
feeling for your Mother I would say that.
It’s such a filth. So God should punish

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:47.190
them [INAUDIBLE]. That’s how they have it
as a punishment. It’s not at all to be afraid

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:52.140
of your own Mother. Will you be? I mean that’s
one thing you are not afraid of, is your own

00:37:52.140 --> 00:38:00.490
Mother. Should not be. I mean modern mothers
I don’t know. But that’s what it is. It

00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:03.980
is they have no knowledge.
Now I must tell you that Sahaja Yoga must

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:09.400
have given realization I don’t know how
many thousands, tens of thousands of people.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:15.110
Of course you may feel little heated up or
if you are possessed, you might feel little

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:20.640
bit shaken up. People who have been to TM,
one of them jumped about 20 ft., when they

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:25.370
heard My name. All these things may happen
to few people. But I mean such extreme cases

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:29.570
are very rare, that’s all. But nothing goes
wrong. I mean you are ultimately cured of

00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:36.540
that. So you might get little effects of that.
But nothing serious. I am here to look after.

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:41.460
On the contrary it’s very blissful, very
blissful.

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:47.808
If one does not know about something, they
should not get into it, isn’t it?

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:49.588
Any other question?
[INAUDIBLE]

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:54.810
But you must get it, that’s the main point.
You see, this if you don’t get, you will

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:58.810
never be happy person. You have to get it
and it is your right. It is within you why

00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:03.780
not get it? It just doesn’t cost you anything.
You have to have it. But people refuse to

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:09.630
have this, imagine refuse to be the Spirit.
Can you imagine?

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:15.460
They are satisfied. The other day I met a
lady who came and she said, “I am quite

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:21.830
satisfied with the simple life I lead, Mother”.
I said, “Now what am I to do? If you are

00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:25.130
satisfied My child, I would only say that
a day will come and you’ll come back to

00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:31.210
Me, but I may not be here”. You see all
these things recoil upon. What question of

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:37.370
sinfulness? Even a sort of a casual way towards
your Spirit, if you are casually interested

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:42.810
in your Spirit it tells upon you, because
Spirit resides in your heart and it recedes,

00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:47.680
you have problems. And you all get into problems
with that. When they get into problems – I

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:52.870
mean a lady who came to Me, she said, “I
am not interested, this that.” And she said,

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:57.870
“I don’t want to do it.” But ultimately
she got cancer. When she came to Me and she

00:39:57.870 --> 00:40:05.280
had a galloping cancer. We tried to help her,
we couldn’t help much, she died. It happens

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:10.010
with some people that they come at a stage
where we cannot help them at all.

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:17.060
So best thing is to get your own powers of
your Spirit and be all right, enjoy yourself.

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:22.090
You don’t have to pay bills of doctors.
You don’t have to worry about so many things.

00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:29.000
And automatically the whole thing works out.
And also the petrol bill, as he said.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:35.950
Krishna has said, “Yogakshema Vahamyaham”.
Means when you have the union – Yoga, when

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:42.270
you become united, with that Divine Power,
the well being is looked after. I mean all

00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:48.960
the Sahaja Yogis who are here, have benefited
even monetarily, because within us lies also

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:54.770
the power, which gives us money. Which gives
us well being. There is a center within us,

00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:58.490
which does that. And if that center is caught
up then people have problems with money. Once

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:09.780
it is cured, you don’t have. Not money as
such but material life, improves definitely.

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:19.890
[INAUDIBLE]
Chakras are the essences, you see, which create

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:23.110
our plexuses. And the plexuses are expressing
the nerves. So the chakras in any case are

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:29.700
the predecessors of the nerves, of the nervous
system. They are the predecessor. They are

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:37.047
the ones who supply the energy to the nerves.
They are the ones who guide the nerves – Chakras.

00:41:37.097 --> 00:41:46.287
[INAUDIBLE]
Astral body – our body is made of various,

00:41:46.287 --> 00:41:54.877
various cocoons we can say. These chakras
are say we are material being or physical

00:41:54.877 --> 00:42:02.095
being, we are emotional being, we are mental
being, we are spiritual being and all these

00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:12.860
are like our body. Now the astral being that
you know is actually the soul, we can say,

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:25.270
which is this whole body without the element
of Earth and Water, that’s the astral body.

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:31.640
Now this astral body you should not worry
much because that we get in any case when

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:38.390
we die. That you are going to get it. But
when we have the body then only we can get

00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:42.250
our realization, not in the astral sense.
But people are trying lots of tricks with

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:48.070
these astral bodies, which is a very very
dangerous thing, and it has reached such dangerous

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:54.970
limits, because people have interest in this,
that I am really shocked the way it is working

00:42:54.970 --> 00:43:00.850
out.
For example: there was a couple in Switzerland

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:10.160
and they had a relation – their mother in
America. And that lady was trying with one

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:17.430
of these astral body persons, those who work
on Spirits and she said that I would like

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:25.570
to talk to my grandson. And the grandson is
a living child and the child is in Switzerland.

00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:31.810
It sounds very fantastic to people. That is
something great you see, the child is in there

00:43:31.810 --> 00:43:37.820
without paying any airfare you can talk to
your child – grand child. It’s very dangerous.

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:42.900
And they used to try that on the child and
the child when it would sleep in the night,

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:50.210
it would be daytime in America. And she would
talk to him through this and she would hear

00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:55.050
the voice of the child. They recorded all
that. One day this child was sleeping and

00:43:55.050 --> 00:44:02.260
he never got up, he died. And the recording
said that it is too much strain for me, now

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:08.470
let me go grandma, let me go, let me go. She
said, “No, no, wait for a while, wait for

00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:13.140
a while” and this spirit controlling woman
would not allow the Spirit to go back and

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:20.830
the child died, is a very common happening
now that the children suddenly die in their

00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:25.250
beds.
So all these tricks we should not try. Whatever

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:31.100
is unknown is not Divine. You have the left
side and the right side. This is called as

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:36.030
the Adibhautik and it’s the Adidaivik, means
the collective subconscious and collective

00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:42.440
supraconscious. There are all these dead Spirits.
Don’t play with them. Don’t get into this

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:48.590
nonsense of astral body and this and that.
There are some people who say that we want

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:55.350
to separate from our body and fly in the air.
Why, why do you want to do that? You want

00:44:55.350 --> 00:45:00.010
to have your spirit or not? If you want to
have these experiences, I am not for that.

00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:06.550
And I will ban it, if you ask Me. It’s absolutely
horrible. Of course people take money for

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:11.380
it and people like it to talk to spirits and
this and that but is very dangerous. You should

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:18.130
never try this with the spirits. Is a very
dangerous line when you do not know about

00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:23.830
it, one should not get to it.
I have known people who have practiced these

00:45:23.830 --> 00:45:30.320
things; their great grand children are suffering,
seven generations they suffer – seven generations.

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:35.200
Those even practice it. So it’s a very dangerous
game, one should never play it. What is the

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:44.310
need? You should live in the present not in
the future or not in the past. It’s the

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:49.990
present you have to achieve. So you just don’t
worry about these things. You become your

00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:56.180
Spirit. You have to be born again and that
should happen to you, which should be an actualization

00:45:56.180 --> 00:46:04.330
that should actually happen.
And what these Gurus are doing, are nothing

00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:10.670
but putting the Spirits in you and are mesmerizing.
That’s how you behave like this. You are

00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:19.940
no more yourself, you are something else.
This is the trick of the trade. They are all

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:28.760
using you for their own purposes by just mesmerizing
and mesmerism is manifested by using the Spirits,

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:34.950
which they are controlling. Especially for
Christians it is forbidden. I don’t know;

00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:45.150
I don’t know how they don’t understand.
So lets have the experience now. It’s just

00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:52.900
a split of a second needed for that, split
of a second. It depends on, if he, if the

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:59.230
landings are very good you won’t feel anything
else but the cool breeze suddenly but if it

00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:07.090
is not smooth landing take little time. As
soon as the Kundalini pierces this, you feel

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:14.020
thoughtless. There is no thought. So you may
try to see just now put your hands towards

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:19.940
Me like this just because the centers are
here expressed of the sympathetic. Just put

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:28.670
your attention to Me and see if your thoughts
have stopped. And then close your eyes. If

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:38.540
that has happened that means Kundalini has
already gone above. It moves very fast, very

00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:45.290
fast it moves.
Now few things you have to accept in Sahaja

00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:52.900
Yoga. First of all you have to accept that
God is the ocean of forgiveness. That He’s

00:47:52.900 --> 00:48:02.540
ocean of love, He is compassion and you are
not guilty in His eyes at all. And you should

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:11.730
not feel guilty before the ocean. So you have
to just say before starting your meditation

00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:16.560
that ‘Mother’, in your heart, ‘I am
not guilty’, ‘Mother, I am not guilty’,

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:19.400
‘Mother, I am not guilty’. Thrice you
have to say.

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:22.320
Now you have to forgive. You must forgive
everyone. Just say that, ‘I forgive’.

00:48:22.395 --> 00:48:26.705
Those who say, “It is very difficult to
forgive”, actually, not to forgive, what

00:48:26.705 --> 00:48:37.665
to forgive is all mental activity. What do
you do by that, just torture yourself? So

00:48:37.665 --> 00:48:45.495
please say that ‘I forgive’ and close
your eyes now. Say, ‘I forgive, Mother I

00:48:45.495 --> 00:48:52.665
forgive everyone’. Just say, ‘Mother I
forgive everyone’. Keep your feet on the

00:48:52.665 --> 00:49:01.165
ground both the sides touching and don’t
move much. Just say ‘Mother I forgive everyone’

00:49:01.165 --> 00:49:13.165
say it thrice. Now put your right hand on
your heart where the Spirit resides. And without

00:49:13.165 --> 00:49:19.075
feeling guilty, without feeling guilty, again
I say, without feeling guilty say that ‘if

00:49:19.075 --> 00:49:25.865
we have done any mistakes, please forgive
us, please forgive me’. Say this thrice

00:49:25.865 --> 00:49:35.095
from your heart – ‘if in my seeking, if
I have done mistake, if I have neglected my

00:49:35.095 --> 00:49:40.205
Spirit or if I have neglected my duties towards
my Spirit, please forgive me’. Just go on

00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:45.740
saying ‘please forgive me’. But don’t
feel guilty with it. You are not to feel guilty

00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:50.007
about it. Just say it that ‘please forgive
me’.

00:49:50.082 --> 00:49:53.972
I think you should again say, ‘I am not
guilty’ because as soon as you say that,

00:49:53.962 --> 00:50:02.022
there’s a catch on the left Vishuddhi, so
you say ‘please forgive me and also forgive

00:50:02.022 --> 00:50:11.482
me for being guilty’. That would be better.
Now you ask a question ‘Mother am I the

00:50:11.517 --> 00:50:18.527
Spirit?’ Ask the question ‘Mother am I
the Spirit?’ Ask thrice – ‘Mother am

00:50:18.527 --> 00:50:30.487
I the Spirit?’ You might feel cool breeze
coming in. You ask thrice. If not, now say

00:50:30.487 --> 00:50:39.866
‘Mother please give me my realization’.
Say it thrice. Just say it thrice. Then it

00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:45.500
would work out. You will start feeling the
cool breeze in the hand – left hand. Stretch

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:54.548
it towards Me, little bit. Stretch it. Ask
for realization. Now don’t feel guilty.

00:50:54.648 --> 00:51:01.621
Are you are getting it now? Don’t feel guilty;
you are not to feel guilty. That’s the biggest

00:51:01.736 --> 00:51:05.751
disease of the West.
Now you put your right hand on the head and

00:51:05.781 --> 00:51:12.241
you might feel the cool breeze coming out
from your head. Just see if there’s a cool

00:51:12.297 --> 00:51:21.654
breeze coming in. Raise it higher, see may
be? Is it? Not feeling. In the hand? Not yet.

00:51:21.701 --> 00:51:25.614
Close your eyes and ask the question – ‘Mother
am I the Spirit?’ Thrice – ‘Mother am

00:51:35.761 --> 00:51:49.071
I the Spirit? Mother am I the Spirit?’ Now
ask for realization – ‘Mother please give

00:51:49.071 --> 00:51:59.271
me my realization’, thrice. Now you can
put your left hand on your head and right

00:51:59.271 --> 00:52:04.351
hand towards Me. Let’s say some people have
this problem you see. Right hand towards Me.

00:52:04.351 --> 00:52:20.081
Now, ask the question ‘Mother am I the Spirit?’
Ok thrice. Now you forgive, you just forgive,

00:52:20.081 --> 00:52:28.571
forgive, forgive everyone. Say, ‘I forgive,
I forgive’ once again, ‘I forgive, I forgive,

00:52:28.571 --> 00:52:29.761
I forgive’. Again, ‘I forgive’. All
right, getting it? Not yet? All right, if

00:52:29.761 --> 00:52:34.231
you won’t, now, not yet? We’ll see.
Are you? Little bit on the hands, just see,

00:52:34.231 --> 00:52:46.251
may be in the hand just see. It will work
out, it will work out. It takes little time

00:52:46.251 --> 00:52:49.221
but it works out, works out, it works out.
Don’t you worry; don’t get desperate with

00:52:49.221 --> 00:52:50.651
yourself. Keep your eyes shut. It will start
coming slowly, slowly, slowly; it will start

00:52:50.651 --> 00:52:50.911
working. It is very subtle but it starts working.
Now. I think open those windows to pass out

00:52:50.911 --> 00:52:51.871
some of these heats. Lot of heat is coming
out.

00:52:51.871 --> 00:52:55.561
Now just see. Douglas, Douglas, see your neighbor,
has he got it on his head? Just see, here

00:52:55.561 --> 00:52:59.591
him, just see him, not yet! He has got it,
he has got. That’s what I feel. Can you

00:52:59.591 --> 00:53:07.251
see all of you? You have got it. I knew, you
got it long time back. Now see, what about

00:53:07.251 --> 00:53:08.121
you? Just ask for forgiveness, a little bit,
all right, ask for forgiveness. Kathy, can

00:53:08.121 --> 00:53:09.371
you see? Can you see the gentleman next to
you? John! We’ll work it out, somebody will

00:53:09.371 --> 00:53:11.781
work it out. Don’t you be worried about
what they are doing because the Power is flowing

00:53:11.781 --> 00:53:31.351
from them so they are just working it out.
Who are all the new people, please raise your

00:53:31.351 --> 00:53:32.301
hands so they’ll come and help you. Just
go, come along. Ken, come along. Left Swadishtan

00:53:32.301 --> 00:53:34.331
– you have to say the mantra of Nirmala
Vidya to get over the left Swadishtana, is

00:53:34.331 --> 00:53:48.401
quite a lot.
[Mother speaks in Marathi].

00:53:48.401 --> 00:53:54.831
It’s all right I think, a little liver,
a little. How is the lady? She has left, left

00:53:54.831 --> 00:54:01.311
Nabhi. Ask her to put her right hand on the
left Nabhi. She’ll be all right.

00:54:01.311 --> 00:54:05.091
[NOT AUDIBLE]
Felicity, are you all right, better? Please

00:54:05.091 --> 00:54:10.531
do not feel guilty. If it has taken time,
don’t you feel guilty. What’s the matter?

00:54:10.531 --> 00:54:14.791
Jamail, right heart. Please don’t feel guilty,
what are you guilty about, don’t feel guilty,

00:54:14.791 --> 00:54:17.911
all right. There is nothing to feel guilty,
what is there to feel guilty? I mean what

00:54:17.911 --> 00:54:21.171
crime have you committed? She has got it actually,
enjoying. Now, how is this gentleman, right

00:54:21.171 --> 00:54:24.561
Vishuddhi? Left? You are feeling guilty, Mr.
all right. Yes, now put your left hand like

00:54:24.561 --> 00:54:30.761
this towards Me. And now put your right hand
here and now say that you are not guilty at

00:54:30.761 --> 00:54:37.001
all. ‘I am not guilty’, just say it to
yourself, say it thrice, again.
