1
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:18,531
I am sorry I had to talk in Hindi because
most of them are Hindi-knowing people

2
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:21,471
and I've just told them what is
the importance of Bombay,

3
00:18:21,496 --> 00:18:28,294
and why so many incarnations came here,
and why Shri Rama

4
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:35,244
had to walk in the villages and the hills
and dales of Maharashtra,

5
00:18:35,276 --> 00:18:43,604
what was the need, and the need is that
they should all develop their Sahaja Yoga.

6
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:48,977
Also, this would be the last Puja
for all of you, in India.

7
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:52,644
I hope you all have gained a lot
in these different Pujas

8
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:57,722
and different places we have been to.

9
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:03,142
Only thing is that one should remember
that Krita Yuga has started.

10
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:07,325
Now Kali Yuga is over, Krita Yuga
has started, and in this Yuga

11
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:14,603
- that the Paramchaitanya is absolutely
effective and very efficient.

12
00:19:14,628 --> 00:19:19,850
Now if you do anything wrong it will
punish you.

13
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:23,786
It may not punish immediately but it
will give you a suggestion,

14
00:19:23,811 --> 00:19:28,680
it will give you a proper signal that
something is going wrong with you.

15
00:19:28,705 --> 00:19:33,806
But if you do not try to control your
footsteps then you may go down very fast.

16
00:19:33,831 --> 00:19:36,612
So you have to be very careful about that.

17
00:19:36,637 --> 00:19:40,074
Actually, I have told you so many times
that there are two forces working,

18
00:19:40,099 --> 00:19:42,928
one which attracts you inside and one
which throws you out.

19
00:19:42,953 --> 00:19:49,935
So it is important for all of us,
all of us to remember

20
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,975
that this Krita Yuga is there, and in that
this Paramchaitanya is overactive.

21
00:19:54,975 --> 00:19:58,948
Also, you are rewarded. You have been
telling me so many stories,

22
00:19:58,973 --> 00:20:02,432
how sahaj it worked out, how sahaj
it has happened,

23
00:20:02,457 --> 00:20:05,912
all of you have been telling Me very
nice stories.

24
00:20:05,937 --> 00:20:14,113
But it is part of your play in Sahaja Yoga

25
00:20:14,138 --> 00:20:17,045
and that you are placed in the kingdom
of God.

26
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:21,394
So, in the kingdom of God you are there,
try to enjoy it,

27
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:24,734
that's the only thing you have to do
is to enjoy the kingdom of God.

28
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:30,426
But if you try to, sort of, dislocate
yourself from this joy,

29
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:37,501
break the connection of joy by some sort
of thinking, which is not reality,

30
00:20:37,526 --> 00:20:40,349
then you are responsible for yourself.

31
00:20:40,374 --> 00:20:44,413
So, I have to tell you that keep
the connection on. Not only that,

32
00:20:44,438 --> 00:20:51,481
but try to make it stronger and stronger,
and become one with that divine force

33
00:20:51,506 --> 00:20:55,860
permanently, which will flow through you
and will not only enlighten you

34
00:20:55,885 --> 00:21:02,398
but will give you so many powers, and you
will see the new life in this new year.

35
00:21:02,423 --> 00:21:05,658
Yesterday, as I requested you, we have
to work it out now.

36
00:21:05,683 --> 00:21:10,554
Individually, we have to go all out to see
that we spread Sahaja Yoga

37
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:15,285
and talk about it. On this day I give you
complete freedom

38
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:19,803
to do what you like to spread Sahaja Yoga.
You need not ask Me any permissions,

39
00:21:19,828 --> 00:21:24,180
and you can try everything that you
want to. But should be something decent,

40
00:21:24,205 --> 00:21:28,329
should not be something indecent
and something which is not behoving

41
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:34,052
a sahaja yogi. Even if you have to write
letters or answers or anything,

42
00:21:34,077 --> 00:21:36,749
even if you have to show the anger
it should be done

43
00:21:36,774 --> 00:21:41,205
in a very decent and a beautiful
manner.

44
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:46,360
And it should show that it's a yogi
who is talking.

45
00:21:46,385 --> 00:21:53,539
The other things, whatever problems
you have, will be solved in no time.

46
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:58,948
But the main problem is yourself, it should
be solved by you by meditative methods.

47
00:21:58,973 --> 00:22:05,975
And so much attention we are paying
to all our extra-curricular activities

48
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,971
but that will definitely fail, it will
boomerang on you

49
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,889
if you do not have the foundation
of Sahaja Yoga.

50
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:17,862
It is very important to keep attention
on your spirit all the time

51
00:22:17,887 --> 00:22:21,484
so that whatever you are doing, whatever
you are projecting,

52
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:25,931
has the base and you just don't get lost.
This is a very important thing,

53
00:22:25,956 --> 00:22:33,767
and I am sure that you will understand
that without the nourishment

54
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:39,939
from the roots you cannot grow. So this
nourishment must be kept alive.

55
00:22:39,964 --> 00:22:43,564
May God bless you. Thank you very much.
