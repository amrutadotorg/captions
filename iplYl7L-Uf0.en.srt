1
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,160
in this small space.

2
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,320
When there is love and understanding,

3
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,840
little space can occupy many hearts.

4
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:33,920
But, when there is no large heart

5
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,920
then whatever one may get is never sufficient.

6
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,360
Today, we are going to worship Shiva Tattva within us,

7
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,200
principle of Shiva.

8
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:56,080
For all Sahaja Yogis it's very important,

9
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,760
because Shiva is the ultimate we have to achieve.

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,440
Shiva is represented in our Spirit,

11
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:14,800
so to become Shiva is the ultimate aim of everything else.

12
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,600
The rest of it is all created,

13
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:28,200
like Vishnu Tattva and Brahmadeva,

14
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,120
just to create human beings, to evolve them

15
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:40,360
and then ultimately lead them to Shiva.

16
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,800
That's the ultimate.

17
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:55,440
But human beings get so involved into the Brahmadeva's Tattva

18
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:01,440
that even to get into Vishnu Tattva is difficult.

19
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,240
They get involved into the five elements which have created

20
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,920
that is the outermost being within us.

21
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:21,240
All the chakras have the outermost, we can say just the vessel,

22
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:29,400
but the desire to be the spirit

23
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:36,240
is of primal importance in Sahaja Yoga.

24
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:43,400
So we have to see inward towards ourselves as Sahaja Yogis,

25
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,280
do we have that desire entirely?

26
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:55,880
Or we have still many desires hanging around?

27
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,080
See the greatest problem is of the Nabhi chakra,

28
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,280
whether it is in the East or the West.

29
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:15,600
Some people still have hankering for the baser search of food,

30
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,800
which is very surprising, even in Sahaja Yoga,

31
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,240
of nabhi chakra.

32
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:31,640
Then, still some people have sense of possessions and money quite a lot.

33
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,520
And subtler and subtler they grow,

34
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:40,120
still the detachment doesn't develop within them.

35
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:48,720
It becomes subtler. As you grow subtler,

36
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,600
the attachment becomes subtler and difficult to get out,

37
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,200
specially people who come up as leaders in Sahaja Yoga

38
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,400
or closer to Sahaja Yoga

39
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,560
are always under attack.

40
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,520
They are attacked

41
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,080
maybe by their husbands, wives,

42
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:14,880
brothers, sisters, sons, children, something like that.

43
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:22,920
And that makes it worse

44
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:28,880
because all such leaders who are attacked

45
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:37,520
try to displease all the deities by small things here and there.

46
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,760
The whole behaviour has to be understood

47
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,120
that you have become a subtler person

48
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,080
and you are rising higher,

49
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,240
so naturally the negative forces are going to attack you.

50
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,840
Always the front line is under attack,

51
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,440
not the back line.

52
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:06,200
So those who are in the front are always under attack

53
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,640
and they have to be very careful

54
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,280
as to how they are behaving.

55
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,360
For if there is a sly person,

56
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,800
he will become sly, but subtler sly.

57
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,840
He will not just become the other way round.

58
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,280
His slyness will become subtler.

59
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:29,120
If he is a miserly fellow, then he will become miserly in a subtler way.

60
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,640
Or say, if he is an ego-oriented fellow,

61
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,040
then he becomes ego-oriented in a subtler way.

62
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:41,920
But to get rid of these things within you,

63
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,520
you have to go to the other side of it.

64
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,680
Say if you are miserly, you become absolutely generous,

65
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,400
give up everything that you have.

66
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,520
Don't be calculating,

67
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,760
don't talk of money, don't worry about money.

68
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,040
If you are extravagant, indulgent too much,

69
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,480
you should go the other way round.

70
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,240
Unless and until you become juxtaposition,

71
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,720
you cannot get rid of these things.

72
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,440
Like if you are hot-tempered man, very hot-tempered,

73
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,560
then become so mild

74
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,560
that even if somebody beats you, it's all right.

75
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,520
Whatever one says it's all right.

76
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:27,600
That's how you get rid of your habits which become subtler and subtler.

77
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:36,280
There's another way of dealing with it, being alert.

78
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,680
When you are alert, you start seeing yourself

79
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,200
as a separate person with the habits that it has,

80
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,640
and then you start understanding why you are behaving. Oh I understand,

81
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,920
I knew you before, ten years back, before my realization.

82
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,080
I know mister, you are like this,

83
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,920
and then take the juxtaposition against that personality

84
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,040
and just shoot it off.

85
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,760
Like a person who is a negative, left-sided person.

86
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,280
Whatever you may do for that person,

87
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,200
he will become subtler and subtler.

88
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,560
Suddenly, if it's a girl,

89
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,640
she will start just crying for nothing at all and feeling miserable.

90
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,440
If it's a boy, if he thinks about, analyses

91
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:25,360
he will become analyzer of Sahaja Yoga, in a subtler way.

92
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,080
Then what they should do is to stand before the photograph

93
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,920
and see the reflection, that's the other one who died.

94
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,040
And just try to make fun of that

95
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,760
or shout at it, depends on.

96
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,320
If it is an aggressive stuff,

97
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,520
it's better to make fun, because it's stupid.

98
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,120
And if it is the one who takes aggression, then shout at it,

99
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,040
what do you mean, by taking aggression like this.

100
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,680
All these things, you see, are keeping you away from reality.

101
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,520
Your being has to be cleansed.

102
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,520
With your help only I can do it.

103
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,760
Many people say, "Mother, You are all powerful."

104
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,440
All right, I am and I can do everything.

105
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,040
But only thing I cannot surpass 'your' freedom. That's a fact.

106
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,600
I cannot cross over your freedom.

107
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:32,080
And when I cannot cross your freedom, 'you' have to cross that.

108
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,800
If in your own freedom, you come inside,

109
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,840
then I will bestow upon you all the blessings.

110
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,080
But if you want to stand outside

111
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,680
I am not the one to put you inside with a pistol.

112
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,400
No, that's not the way it will work out.

113
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,120
This is one hurdle that Sahaja Yogis must know

114
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,360
that at every moment you are free, and freer, and freest.

115
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,760
The more free you become, the worse is your situation

116
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,920
as far as the facing of the negativity is concerned.

117
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,760
Say there are four persons around you.

118
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,880
They will be first attacked.

119
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,920
Naturally you can understand the front line is always under attack,

120
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,120
not the back side.

121
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,840
Though according to the law, it should be the back side

122
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,120
because all these horrible negative forces should come from the back.

123
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,360
But they are very clever.

124
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,200
They know that the back sometimes drop off by themselves;

125
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,920
there is no need to go that side. They try the front line.

126
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,480
And those who think they are in charge and responsible

127
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,280
have to be very careful as to how they behave,

128
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,800
how they are responsible, how they work it out.

129
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,080
If they are keeping their old habits

130
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,760
at a subtler level or they are just fighting it. It's very important.

131
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:00,600
And this is how intelligently you can manage yourselves.

132
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,320
Then once you become detached,

133
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,080
go from all these things, only at mental level.

134
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,040
The spiritual level I'll look after you.

135
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,320
At mental level, you must come to logical conclusion that

136
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,240
"I have to fight this nonsensical stuff.

137
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,560
I have to be alert about this nonsense that exists within me."

138
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,800
Shiva Tattva is innocent, absolutely innocent it is.

139
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,080
It is very powerful and extremely innocent.

140
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,840
And the secret to achieve it is only just to please, just please.

141
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,320
If you please Shiva, then you may be a rakshasa or anything,

142
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,120
He grants all kinds of boons.

143
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:04,920
But to a rakshasa He can only grant the boon of longevity, of long life.

144
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:13,760
But to a saint, He'll grant the Satchitananda state.

145
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,520
So even if He grants anything to a rakshasa,

146
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,840
one should not ask questions about it.

147
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,440
He can give you longevity - what does it matter,

148
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,360
even if he lives for thousands of years and earn nothing out of it;

149
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,760
he'll never get your realization.

150
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:40,720
So to a saint, He gives that eternal longevity

151
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,480
which comes through Spirit.

152
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,520
This is the blessing of Shiva Tattva.

153
00:11:49,520 --> 00:12:02,520
While Vishnu Tattva, He gives ascent to a saint

154
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:09,360
and light of wisdom to see

155
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,400
and understand everything in collective consciousness

156
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:24,120
and to a rakshasa He gives death, He kills.

157
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:33,560
So for people who are not so deep,

158
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,160
it seems that why should Shiva give any blessings of longevity

159
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,560
to a rakshasa.

160
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:50,160
These are the characters of these different deities.

161
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:58,680
Now for example, if a rakshasa wants to live long,

162
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,480
he goes to Shiva, pleases Him

163
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:09,280
by praising Him, singing songs to Him, by asking His blessings,

164
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,440
by doing tapas for Him, talking about Shiva's innocence

165
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,800
he gets longevity.

166
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,240
Sometimes,

167
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,920
these rakshasas are better on the earth than in the subconscious.

168
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,160
They can be horrid.

169
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,720
They can gather some more bhoots

170
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,240
to torture human beings.

171
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,480
So it's better to keep them in the eyes of Vishnu.

172
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:46,600
He manages them better here than to send them into the subconscious.

173
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,480
But Shiva's style is very different from that of Vishnu's style.

174
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,920
You have to have all kinds of styles

175
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,240
because you know there are so many permutations and combinations

176
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,800
in human beings.

177
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,400
If you have one style,

178
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,600
what will you do with the other style of human beings?

179
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,840
So the style of Vishnu is

180
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,640
that if you are trying to be funny,

181
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:17,800
He plays tricks and puts you right.

182
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,760
Say, a Sahaja Yogi

183
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,200
He is not interested - Vishnu - so much interested in other people,

184
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:27,560
but in Sahaja Yogis. If Sahaja Yogi tries to be funny;

185
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:33,640
say he wants to drink wine, all right, He says, "Drink wine."

186
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,320
He drinks the wine, and then he gets sick somewhere,

187
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,640
his cars falls off, or he is insulted somewhere.

188
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,840
Something happens to him, he is punished so badly

189
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:49,600
that he says, "Oh God, what have I done?" That's Vishnu tattva.

190
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,080
But Shiva is the other way round.

191
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:58,920
If you see Shiva's style is this; that if you drink,

192
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,240
He just disappears from your heart.

193
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:07,040
You have a heart attack and you die.

194
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,640
He also kills.

195
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:14,360
One kills directly in a positive way, He definitely kills;

196
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:19,720
the another one by recession. If Shiva disappears, how can you exist,

197
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,400
that's one way. Second way is that,

198
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,720
those who are born with Shiva tattva

199
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,480
like our Sainath was - Shirdi Sainath,

200
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,920
or people like that;

201
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,680
even the Devis sometimes can do that.

202
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,240
They drink away all the wines of the world, all the poisons of the world.

203
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,640
Like Shiva did that.

204
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:49,680
So when Sainath found that so many people were smoking this tobacco,

205
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,760
he smoked all the tobacco of the world.

206
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:57,920
He tried to smoke everything in Maharashtra so that nobody should get it.

207
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,760
That's the style of Shiva to take all the poison into Himself.

208
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,280
And to absorb all the poison within Himself.

209
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,200
He can deal with the most difficult things;

210
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,200
so the one dealing comes through the brain.

211
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:19,480
Because Virata is in our brain, acts through the brain.

212
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,200
So He plays tricks on you.

213
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,800
And that appeals to us because we can see that He's killed someone.

214
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,200
So we think 'very nice Mother, You have punished that person'.

215
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,360
But Shiva Tattva gives you the problems

216
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:42,520
which normally you cannot see, but works out in a short time like that.

217
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,440
Like heart troubles

218
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:52,600
or a person who has a very poor Shiva Tattva

219
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:58,520
can have all the incurable diseases of the world.

220
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:06,440
There nobody is killed, but every minute the person is suffering.

221
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,520
That is the way Shiva corrects.

222
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,440
In us when Shiva Tattva is awakened

223
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,440
our priorities change absolutely.

224
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,360
I see now that those who have come, say,

225
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,120
to India from the west

226
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,880
have changed quite a lot in their priorities, but still

227
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,800
there is not so much change as it should be.

228
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,080
They're of course thousand times better

229
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,880
than their fellow beings who are not realized souls.

230
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:46,400
But still, attachment to things, attachment to money is quite a lot.

231
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,760
This detachment must work out.

232
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,680
See things are not correct in people and the alertness is not there.

233
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:00,240
To give a very, very gross example of this, I will tell you that,

234
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:08,080
a gentleman, say, came and he was told that you have to give,

235
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,720
say, eleven rupees for puja. He said,

236
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,680
"On principle we are not supposed to give."

237
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,840
So I mean, you are only paying even on principle

238
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:24,280
you are only paying for your food and lodging, not for puja.

239
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,840
The other side of it they will not even see

240
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,840
that Mother is spending so much for us extra for which we are not paying.

241
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:38,280
It's not all found. Like the other day, I said

242
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,040
that people are now asking Me to pay for this,

243
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,880
then tomorrow they will say pay for our house rents. It was so.

244
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,840
It was such a condition, once upon a time in London when I started the ashram.

245
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,920
That they asked for all the utensils in the ashram,

246
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,920
I paid for the rent, paid for everything.

247
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,920
Ultimately they said we don't have an ironing board, please send us.

248
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:05,360
From that, it's not so bad now, I mean, of course.

249
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,320
But still, if they have to pay 5 rupees for taxi,

250
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,640
they will think that, "Oh we have to pay for taxi - Mother is supposed to pay."

251
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,960
But if I pay

252
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,680
7000- 8000 rupees for you to go to Haridwar, that's all right.

253
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:24,400
That's good. That nobody wants to find out, how Mother is paying for us.

254
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,560
It's surprising and this disturbs Me very much

255
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:36,840
that what is your attitude towards that.

256
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:42,280
The pleasing should be done with full heart.

257
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,640
Say if you have to buy any presents for your friends, or anything,

258
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,280
you don't mind spending money for that.

259
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,600
But for puja you have objections.

260
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,880
For your laundry you used to pay always, I mean

261
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,360
I have seen the laundry bill, I was amazed how much money was spent.

262
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,680
But 21 Rupees, the principle was involved,

263
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,560
imagine. Look at it.

264
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,440
If you look at it, you will be shocked at yourselves.

265
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,920
That shows despite all this, you have got your realization.

266
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:20,360
See the generosity. It's very, very - you see, it's very gross.

267
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,280
It's very gross.

268
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:30,520
So the detachment from this gross life must go away.

269
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,240
But an ordinary villager understands better because he is innocent.

270
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,560
He is innocent. Because you are not innocent.

271
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,080
That's why you see everything from your mind.

272
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,520
You think about it.

273
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,560
How much have we paid, how much this is, this that, this that.

274
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,800
But an innocent villager even if he has four annas,

275
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,040
he would like to do something,

276
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,080
"Mother - that's all I have."

277
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,920
We have a parable in the Bible.

278
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,280
And this is what it is. One should see our detachment starts

279
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:12,280
at a very baser level of money.

280
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,880
You need not have any friends,

281
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:20,880
what is the need to give  to any friends?

282
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,520
What are these friends for?

283
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,600
Except for Shiva Tattva, what other friend you need?

284
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:35,800
Think of it, without God, what is your life?

285
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,160
So the detachment must start. The priorities must change

286
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,920
and you must know that God is the One who is your Friend,

287
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,520
who is your Father, who is your Mother,

288
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,800
who is to be worshipped, there is nothing else.

289
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,520
Tana, mana, dhana, everything is for God.

290
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,600
Of course, I don't want anything from you, you know that.

291
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:02,200
But that should be the attitude of a person.

292
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:12,920
So the first - this attitude comes in a person.

293
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,560
Of course, in Sahaja Yoga, you have a great advantage

294
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,160
that those who have developed this attitude

295
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,320
have been helped so much materially

296
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,920
that you find the proof of it immediately.

297
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,800
The proof is there and those who do not take to this kind of a thing

298
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:37,120
suffer. So the proof is there.

299
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:47,760
I must give you an example of a - goldsmith.

300
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,560
I had given him something to be made for the Puja.

301
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,280
A lot of gold was given, everything.

302
00:22:54,280 --> 00:23:01,040
And still, stupidly, he tried to make money out of that.

303
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,440
And he got cancer and he died.

304
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:10,440
I didn't do anything. But I knew he had made money, I knew that all.

305
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:16,160
I knew lots of things, I didn't say anything to him, nothing, never

306
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:25,040
never even mentioned. He got cancer and he died, he is no more.

307
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,440
Because Shiva Tattva disappeared.

308
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:34,760
This was for a puja, the money of the saints,

309
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,800
something was to be made and he should not have done it.

310
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,400
The proof is just there.

311
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,040
Now, those who knew him got a fright of their lives,

312
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:47,400
"Oh God, now no more of this from us at least."

313
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,080
But those who have been surrendered about their money part also,

314
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,440
not that I take anything from them nor I want anything from you.

315
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,840
But, still the attitude I am saying is different,

316
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,800
they have gone out, they have made money,

317
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,480
they are very rich, they are very well to do, they are all right.

318
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,560
They get so much blessings - everything.

319
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:23,120
This is the first Nabhi chakra. We should start by putting Shiva.

320
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:31,560
Every attachment can be attacked with Shiva Tattva

321
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:36,920
because Shiva Tattva is brilliant like a diamond, brilliant.

322
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:41,120
Every facet can be cleansed out, very simply

323
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,600
through our Kundalini awakening and through our alertness

324
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:52,040
and what after that you can see there are other attachments we have.

325
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:57,920
This is friendship, sympathies, friendships.

326
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,720
Sympathies always go to a person

327
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,440
who is in need or something like that.

328
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,920
You have no sympathies, have tortured so many people.

329
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,880
The other way also could be that you hate someone too much,

330
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,840
you love someone too much, some sort of a thing like that.

331
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:22,760
So detachment comes that you do not hate nor you love anyone.

332
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,600
You leave it to God.

333
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,680
That's the kind of a detachment that you leave it to God.

334
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,640
God, please that's His decision. I am not going to judge.

335
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,920
Only thing I judge them on Kundalini and I awaken their kundalini.

336
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,240
If it works out well and good, if it doesn't work out, all right.

337
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,800
So we have detached yourselves,

338
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,400
from the responsibility of judging others.

339
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,560
Only your judgment is on Kundalini, if it works out, all right.

340
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,440
But, you are just like a barometer that's all,

341
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,080
or like a machine that cures. You are not involved into it.

342
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,320
So this involvement into personal lives and personal relationships

343
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,280
like mother, sister, brother every sort of a nonsense

344
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,280
must be taken up.

345
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,120
Now say, if your mother is not all right,

346
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,760
you must just get after her and see that she is put right.

347
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,920
That's very important; mother has to be all right.

348
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,080
If she's not all right,

349
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,200
then you tell her, "I'm not going to eat food from your hand", finished.

350
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,320
You get your vibrations, all right.

351
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,920
You tell her that "You better take to realization otherwise

352
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:40,160
I will not have anything to do with you. I'm just going to see,

353
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,400
talk to you and go away."

354
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,440
Show that detachment to her. Be strong.

355
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,440
You must cure your mother. Very important

356
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,840
because mother is a part of Sahaja Yoga,

357
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,080
it's very important. But many people I have seen

358
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,600
just do not know how to resist. You must protest;

359
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,280
go on protesting one after another

360
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:05,320
because that's the greatest thing you are doing for your mother.

361
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,560
What else can you give it to her?

362
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,400
Anything you give the whole world has no meaning

363
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,400
except correcting your mother for a better life,

364
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,840
an eternal life, life of God.

365
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,840
Then your wife

366
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,240
your wife is a very dangerous situation.

367
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,120
If your wife is negative, she will go on

368
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,480
putting into your head things which will work out at a odd time

369
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,440
and you will be amazed how you slipped out

370
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,880
these things and how you said these things. Why should you have done it

371
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,080
why did you do this.

372
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,240
But the wife is to be told that,

373
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,440
"You have to behave yourself; you have to get all right,

374
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,320
nothing doing. And there is no compromise.

375
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,440
You be in another room, I will be in another room.

376
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,520
You should get well. I am not going to help."

377
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,440
Because that is even much more dangerous

378
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,920
because you know if the woman is catching

379
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:12,920
then there are very serious diseases developed in the Mooladhara.

380
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,040
So you have to be strict with your wife.

381
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,360
You should make her, you should tell her,

382
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,120
"I'll not eat any food with your hands.

383
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,440
I'll have nothing to do, I'll not talk to you,

384
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,360
I'll just come and sleep in another room.

385
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,640
You better not touch my clothes.

386
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,800
If you don't listen to me then I have nothing to do with you

387
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,480
or better I'm your husband.

388
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,840
Whatever dharma I follow you have to follow me,

389
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,120
if you don't want to listen to me, then I have nothing to do with you."

390
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,080
The wife can also do the same with the husband.

391
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,440
Gradually showing indifference

392
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,800
in a way that he understands that it doesn't bring love.

393
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,800
That's how women corrected men long time back.

394
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,600
Nowadays, of course women, if you give them something,

395
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,800
they are get pleased.

396
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,240
Even if there is a keep,

397
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,880
as long as they are giving diamonds to the wife

398
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,480
she is quite pleased with the keep.

399
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,800
Still in India it's not accepted.

400
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,280
But I have seen in the west nobody minds,

401
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,520
if the husband has ten keeps doesn't matter

402
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,440
as long as he is giving you the money, all right, nobody minds it.

403
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,320
That's very funny.

404
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,880
So wife's relation, mother's relation, husband's relations,

405
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,160
close relations must be corrected.

406
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,520
Now children must be guarded.

407
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,600
You shouldn't allow your children to go away to the wrong things.

408
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,360
If they are doing wrong things, they are not coming to Sahaja Yoga,

409
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,920
you are duty bound;

410
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,600
you should say, I'm not going to pay you any money, nothing doing.

411
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:51,720
I'll not see your faces, if you do not take to Sahaja Yoga.

412
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:57,480
What else are you going to give to your children, but God?

413
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:08,200
You can do it. All can do it.

414
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:14,320
But one should know 'I' need not do it.

415
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,600
So many people say

416
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,080
that, "Mother, Your husband is not so much a Sahaja Yogi."

417
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,120
It's all right. I know where to bring him in;

418
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,520
I know when to bring My children in;

419
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,280
because if they were in everybody would have said,

420
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:33,560
"They have floated a family enterprise."

421
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,520
As long as they are out of it, it's a very good idea

422
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,200
specially in India.

423
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,480
So best thing is if they oppose Me, I keep all of them out,

424
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:54,080
My brothers. Imagine My own brothers, My own - I mean,

425
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,080
they all have tremendous respect for Me, no doubt.

426
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,840
Even My brothers said that, "Thank God You are staying in my room now,

427
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,240
so the vibrations will be very good for me.

428
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,920
What do You think of my vibrations?"

429
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,680
Everything he says, but he is not a Sahaja Yogi.

430
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,360
I have given realization to all of them, everything is there,

431
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,640
but they are not Sahaja Yogis - apart of this.

432
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,360
Otherwise they will be in charge of money, you see.

433
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,440
What money you get. Now come along

434
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:25,040
this is the money we have, all problems.

435
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,640
With all these relations around, you don't know.

436
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,040
Somebody will go and say, "Shri Mataji said so."

437
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,280
"Oh, that's the daughter of Mataji  has said so." - That becomes so.

438
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:39,440
I don't want all these pressures on My head.

439
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,560
That's the best way; I wish our politicians understand that;

440
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,320
never have your relations around.

441
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,160
That's the best way to administer.

442
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,720
If you have your relations around,

443
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,920
then you will never do right things.

444
00:31:54,920 --> 00:32:01,040
Or even if you do right things, your relations will spoil it.

445
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,320
So all those who are Sahaja Yogis must know

446
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,160
that you should not try to help your relations

447
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:13,200
in a way that they take advantage of Sahaja Yoga.

448
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,280
Like, if you are a Sahaja Yogi,

449
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:21,680
then you bring your mother and make her sit in front of Me.

450
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:25,320
First correct her vibrations,

451
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:31,240
put her right and then bring her.

452
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,200
Correct my father, correct my mother is not Mother's responsibility,

453
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,680
it's your own.

454
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:41,240
When they are all right, then as you bring flowers to Me,

455
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:48,440
bring your relations as a very good present from your family.

456
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:53,080
That's a much better thing than to be like this that

457
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,440
I have to clear. If one is a Sahaja Yogi,

458
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,920
all his three generations up and down,

459
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,880
this side and that side have to cure that is done.

460
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,920
Like Malhotra made Me do.

461
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,640
So one should detach from these family ties

462
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:18,040
and these emotional imbalances we have, emotional problems we have

463
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:22,440
by understanding that the only thing that these people should have

464
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,560
is Sahaja Yoga.

465
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,480
And some people should not be in Sahaja Yoga

466
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,560
like as I said - My own husband, and My daughter and My relations,

467
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,520
I'll keep them out.

468
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,440
All such people if there are any,

469
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,840
you should not also have them anywhere near Sahaja Yoga.

470
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:47,320
You should be discrete to find out.

471
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,720
Although, all these, My relations are very dharmic people,

472
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,240
extremely dharmic, very good.

473
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,400
Very self-respecting, all qualities they have got - everything.

474
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:02,240
Ready made, but they are not in Sahaja Yoga.

475
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,240
So none of you can say so-body said so, so one said so.

476
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:13,120
It has to be Mother has to say.

477
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,120
This detachment has to come, it takes time.

478
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,400
Especially with Indians,

479
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,840
all the time they are worried about their children, mother or father

480
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,680
on and on and on and on and on.

481
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:28,240
See years together, my son, my daughter, my son, my father –

482
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,840
all the time.

483
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,880
Now by God's grace

484
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,800
so many have got rid of all their responsibilities somehow,

485
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,880
through Sahaja Yoga, or whatever it is,

486
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,440
so they are now they have settled down with themselves,

487
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,160
because you have your own responsibility.

488
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:48,520
So this detachment must be brought those who are coming to Sahaja Yoga,

489
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:53,120
that we are here to get Sahaja Yoga blessings.

490
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,480
We are going to be blessings, with that pride.

491
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,040
You should be in the family, all right.

492
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,440
If you want to have Sahaja Yoga, you have it.

493
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,360
But not to force them on Sahaja Yoga,

494
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,040
but you can force Sahaja Yoga on them,

495
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,040
the stage has come that you have to talk about Sahaja Yoga to them.

496
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,480
In the beginning I used to say, "Don't talk to them."

497
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,320
But those who are useless, if they are not to be brought in Sahaja Yoga,

498
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,280
tell them, "You are not good for Sahaja Yoga, better not ask."

499
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,400
Then they will come.

500
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,520
Some people you should show complete indifference,

501
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,440
"you are incapable, you are no good, you are too materialistic."

502
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:31,080
Then that person would say, "I will prove that I am"

503
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,880
All these detachments take place

504
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:45,680
and then the detachments are at Nabhi chakras,

505
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,280
will rise up to your emotional side in your Heart chakra.

506
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:55,920
And then you have to have the detachment even of a

507
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,680
kind of a collectivity that we think is collectivity.

508
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:07,640
I call the fraternity of the bhoots, not collectivity.

509
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:14,440
Always all the useless Sahaja Yogis will form a group

510
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:21,800
and they will have a very strong objection

511
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,720
to everything that is sensible.

512
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,480
And they will have suggestions for everything.

513
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:35,280
There has to be no suggestions at all.

514
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,600
There are no alternatives, because Shiva is absolute.

515
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:47,080
Once what is said is said, you just do it and see - that's the best.

516
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:53,760
Alternatives will be second best or third best or maybe useless.

517
00:36:53,760 --> 00:37:00,840
But there is no alternative for Shiva Tattva.

518
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:06,520
I'll give an example, I told Delhi people that you organise say,

519
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,920
program for seven days outside with other people.

520
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,440
It was sensible because I knew it was to rain. It has to rain also.

521
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,040
Rain can be stopped, but it was to rain for all the other villagers, you see.

522
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,280
We cannot stop it only for Sahaja Yogis.

523
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,840
Of course, Sahaja Yogis are important so I said,

524
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,640
"Let them be with other Sahaja Yogis."

525
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,200
Now they started an alternative, only thinking,

526
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:35,120
that you see they won't be comfortable. And I mean it was good,

527
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,840
but on a other level that they will not be comfortable

528
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,040
with Sahaja Yogis, another level.

529
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,720
But there has to be understanding if Mother has said it

530
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,720
it must be done - whatever it is.

531
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,520
Even if She says, "You kill somebody", you have to kill.

532
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,920
Keep it like that to that extent.

533
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,680
Keep to the maximum,

534
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,840
Even if She says, "You have to die", you should die.

535
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:07,320
If She says, "All  right, you tell lies."

536
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,320
Go on, "I'll tell lies."

537
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,120
Like Radhaji, She said, "What is my punyas, what is my papas.

538
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:19,040
I'm His wife. What can I do, whatever He tells Me."

539
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,920
That is Shiva Tattva.

540
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:27,400
When it is awakened you see it at least recognizes Shiva in Me.

541
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:32,080
And it sees that this is Shiva Tattva.

542
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:37,480
It understands because at Shiva Tattva you don't commit any sins,

543
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,680
you are sinless.

544
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:46,200
When you are the Spirit, you are sinless; there is no sin in you.

545
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,240
If, supposing according to human understanding

546
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,400
if Shiva leaves a person dies, then it's sinful. Why to leave anybody.

547
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,560
It's sinful, isn't it? For all common purposes,

548
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:02,240
common understanding will think that it is sinful for Shiva to leave

549
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,200
the person and make the person die.

550
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,840
For example, a lady dies, her children are left behind,

551
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,920
then one can blame Shiva for that

552
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:16,240
"See now You went away and these children are now without a mother

553
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,440
or without a father", or something like that.

554
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,440
Because Shiva is sinless; whatever He does is sinless.

555
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,840
So whatever you do is sinless

556
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:33,440
the idea of sin is finished because who commits sin is your ego.

557
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,560
Ego commits sin.

558
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,760
But if you have no ego, there's no sin

559
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,920
because you are not doing anything.

560
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,920
You stand in Akarma. Say the sun is shining and shining sharp

561
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,640
and somebody wants to stand in the sun then he gets burns.

562
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,720
It's not the fault of the sun, the sun is shining

563
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:01,840
that's the job of sun.

564
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:06,560
Whatever is the job of the Shiva, He is doing it. He's not sinful.

565
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:11,040
It's our mental attitude makes us think, this is sin, this is not sin.

566
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,080
But when we have ego, we are committing sins.

567
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,000
If you ask a tiger,

568
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,880
"You are committing a sin because you are eating a cow."

569
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,200
He will say, "I never knew what a sin was.

570
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,840
I don't know what sin is."

571
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,720
It's a story when some missionaries

572
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,760
were going away from a village, you see.

573
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,560
So the villagers - poor, innocent villagers, they got up to thank them.

574
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:39,160
They said, "Thank God, when you came here you told us there is sin.

575
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:43,920
We didn't know what sin was."

576
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,120
Innocent people, they don't know what is sin.

577
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,120
Because Spirit is innocent, it has no sin.

578
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:56,360
It obeys the other source of innocence.

579
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,760
So there is no sin for a person who is innocent.

580
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,120
For Shiva, there is no sin whether He wants to give

581
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,800
His blessings to a rakshasa

582
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:13,720
or to a saint. There is no sin for Him because He is bholenath.

583
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:21,280
He is beyond sin. Whatever He does, He is beyond sin

584
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,360
because ego cannot envelope Him. There is no ego.

585
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:30,920
Because we have ego we commit sins.

586
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:36,360
Once ego is finished we are no more there, so who commits sins?

587
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,920
When we are not there, who is committing the sin?

588
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,440
Shiva can't commit sins, so we are the Shiva

589
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,600
so we cannot commit sins.

590
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,360
So all these ideas of giving alternatives

591
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,960
at the mental level is also wrong.

592
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:56,440
I give - anything I say, immediately there will be ten suggestions.

593
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,560
I try all these tricks with you.

594
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:07,040
Because you are used to conferences, you see.

595
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:12,160
So I said, "All right, Subramanian, what do you have to say about it?"

596
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,760
Because after all, Lord Subramanian is there. Must ask him.

597
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:23,040
Then I ask Venugopalan, then I'll ask Maureen

598
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:29,520
all these people. Now what do you have to say?

599
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,600
And then they give their suggestions.

600
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:43,680
But if you see in the conference of all the Divine Deities,

601
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:49,600
there is no suggestion, no suggestion, no alternative.

602
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,040
No alternatives to your Mother's ideas, nothing.

603
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:59,280
Absolute. It's absolute. Nobody gives any suggestions to Me;

604
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:08,840
Never. No question.

605
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,360
They won't listen to you, they won't listen to anyone.

606
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:20,240
There's no question. Such harmony; complete obedience.

607
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,800
And not only they are fixed with their qualities.

608
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:31,200
They are told that you have to do it, they'll do it.

609
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,440
This is the difference.

610
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,760
They try. Sometimes it appears, you see.

611
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,280
If I say all right, go this way and you will find the place

612
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,680
but you won't find.

613
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,720
So then you will say, 'See Mother You said to go this

614
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,920
and that's why we went this way and we didn't find the church.'

615
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,880
Now there it is not that I'm saying that you will find the church,

616
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:59,200
it is I am trying to see what you think.

617
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:04,680
I am telling you My own tricks, all right, so be careful.

618
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:09,720
I'll tell you all, go this way, now you didn't find the church, I'm sorry.

619
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,720
I should not have told you. Or you shouldn't have gone that way.

620
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,440
But that's not true. I must tell you, that's not true.

621
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,880
What I'm trying to see what you are saying about this.

622
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,560
Now if you are clever, you would say,

623
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:28,120
"I went there, I didn't see the place, but I saw something else, Mother

624
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:32,480
that's the reason You sent me there. Now I know why You sent me there."

625
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:37,280
That's it. Then I know that he is Sahaja Yogi. But if you say:

626
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,920
"Oh I went there because I thought I will find this thing,"

627
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,320
"but, it was not there, and 'You' sent me, 'You' sent me"

628
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:50,080
Finished. If you say that, You said so and it happened

629
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:55,360
or I did say, no doubt. But what I said was just to play a trick on you.

630
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,440
Because one of the natures of your Mother is Mahamaya;

631
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,560
so be careful. How you react

632
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,440
is very important for Me to see how far you have gone.

633
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:09,760
This is one of the ways you are judged.

634
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,680
But for a villager, it's a different thing if you see.

635
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,360
If I tell him: "Now if you want Me

636
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:22,640
to go to that village, see, take the cart,

637
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:27,360
or take the bullock cart this way; we'll take it."

638
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:32,200
But there will be a ditch. So I'll get it.

639
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:35,520
So he will say, "Mother, I'm sorry, you got it.

640
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,080
I could have avoided it.

641
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,320
See. So he takes the responsibility upon himself.

642
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,000
He takes everything upon himself.

643
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,320
Because you asked Me so I had to go that way

644
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:50,560
but I could have avoided it if I was there careful.

645
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,840
So this is the difference you know, not to put the responsibility.

646
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:58,200
It's a common human nature is to put responsibility on somebody else.

647
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,800
Best is to put on Mother

648
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:07,680
But in that you lose all your punyas.

649
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:13,200
So the responsibility is mine, I must have done some mistake.

650
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,360
I must have done some mistake somewhere

651
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:21,560
or else maybe that Mother wants me to learn something in this.

652
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:25,400
Every time you do something, I tell you something,

653
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,920
it's just for you to learn something. I don't have to learn anything.

654
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,480
If you think that way that I have to learn something now you know.

655
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,480
So you have to learn something.

656
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,280
And that is what if you understand; then a kind of a detachment

657
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,080
will build in you and a surrender.

658
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:46,600
You will be amazed that you will be so much

659
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,320
relieved of nonsensical

660
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,600
headaches that you have and the burdens you carry.

661
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:58,400
If you understand that the whole joke,

662
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,280
the whole work, the whole drama is done by Mother

663
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:07,680
and I am just playing into it. It's so simple.

664
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:12,480
That is to be understood.

665
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,400
And the enjoyment lies in that.

666
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,440
Not in judging or finding alternatives.

667
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:24,840
You try it. Those who have tried it have enjoyed it very much.

668
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:29,280
And so many things. Every minute, I'll give you an example of that.

669
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,040
I'll give you an example of Gregoire

670
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,120
last time I went to his house.

671
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,760
He tortured My life for his wife.

672
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,560
When will she have her delivery, how will she have,

673
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,160
who is going to stay with her?

674
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,240
Morning till evening, he had one talk.

675
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,920
All right, I said, "Something will be done.

676
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,600
You can have this lady to stay with you."

677
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:50,680
And then, "How will I go to India?" I mean, "I" was so important.

678
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,760
Then he didn't realize it at that time,

679
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,080
he thought it was so important to do that.

680
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,200
Ultimately quite before going I told him,

681
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,560
"Gregoire, you troubled Me too much this time."

682
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:05,160
" But it's all right." Then he said, "I'm sorry."

683
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,400
Then he telephoned Me one day saying,

684
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,640
"Mother, my wife is in for abortion.

685
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,520
She has gone to the hospital, there is no chance." I said, "Forget it.

686
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,080
You go back to the hospital, she will be all right."

687
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,760
He went to the hospital and they said, "It's a miracle."

688
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:25,520
"She's perfectly all right, there's no problem. She's all right."

689
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,120
So it came into his head, as he told Me.

690
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:31,560
Oh, Mother is looking after it, why should I worry.

691
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:34,600
Why should I worry? This is first thing.

692
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:39,240
Then, the child was born earlier than time.

693
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:42,680
And he came to Me.

694
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:46,000
So also I convinced him, what I say

695
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,080
what I do, you know that.

696
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,920
That I look after you.

697
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:55,200
But when you take up responsibility upon yourself and start thinking about it,

698
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,640
then I cannot help.

699
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:01,840
So just know that leave it to God.

700
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,680
It's all for your good, for your 'hitha'

701
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,760
Everything is for your 'hitha'.

702
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:11,360
Whatever it is, sometimes I have to shout at you, sometimes I have to

703
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:14,720
correct you, sometimes I have to tell you that, "Don't come here."

704
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,920
Some people who touch Me, you see, can give me horrible sensations,

705
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,760
then I say, "You just don't come here. You don't stand before Me,

706
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,160
get out from here." That helps them.

707
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,600
But if they stand there, the bhoots will never leave

708
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,920
because the bhoots want to trouble Me.

709
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,240
So this point if you understand, you will get completely detached

710
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:39,080
and will know that for our good, for our betterment

711
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,200
we must keep Mother pleased and

712
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,080
these things if we do by displeasing Her,

713
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,720
we are going to be finished.

714
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:51,800
Now to understand this, what you need - not age, not position,

715
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:57,920
not your qualifications, nothing - you need a wise mind.

716
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,680
Deep personality.

717
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,840
I've seen very young people are so sensible

718
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:07,480
their parents are stupid, absolutely stupid people.

719
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,840
So you just need a wise, deep personality to do it

720
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,480
and that you should try to develop.

721
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,880
That comes only sticking onto Shiva tattva,

722
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:21,440
which is a solid thing, which is Shiva, Achara

723
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,040
which doesn't move, absolute.

724
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:27,200
It is not relative, it's not relative at all

725
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:32,080
it's not related to anything, absolute. That gives you the depth.

726
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:37,920
That depth which is required to settle down, to go deep.

727
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:43,080
Shiva is your guru. Guru is the one that gives you the gravity

728
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:47,880
to go straight down deep into it.

729
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:04,080
That is very important. And all this

730
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:09,320
I hope with the puja today

731
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:12,400
we'll try to settle you

732
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:17,480
into that great principle of Shiva.

733
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:22,640
Let your attention, every particle of your attention be filled,

734
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:37,640
sparkled and rejoice by that blessing of Shiva tattva.

735
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:40,200
I bless you all! May God bless you!

736
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:52,200
So to begin with, we are going to worship the Devi first of all,

737
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,120
and then the Shiva.
