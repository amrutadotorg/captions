00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:13.110
symmetry what is sahaja yoga sahaja some

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:17.190
is faith Germans born so it is born with

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:21.869
you the right to become United which is

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.240
the yoga with the divine and this this

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.189
sahaja yoga is something that everybody

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:32.210
can have is it is something everybody

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:35.040
can practice of course and how does the

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.160
this connection with the divine take

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.710
place we have within ourselves this

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.370
power in the triangular bone which is

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.850
called a sacred meaning sacred which

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.000
when awakened sprouts like a premium in

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:58.190
a seed and Rises through six subtle

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:02.129
centers opens out the last center and

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:05.460
gets connected with the damar which is a

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:09.510
subtle energy all around us which

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.979
organizes us which nourishes us does all

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.090
the living work above all it loves us

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:20.310
does this mainstream mythology that

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.770
people who have not had the ability to

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.280
practice sahaja yoga are not connected

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.780
with the divine most of them are not I

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:33.150
need some of them are they don't know

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.549
all about it so this is what a an extra

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.320
force that is available to human beings

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.630
to develop themselves in this way of

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.270
course this is the last breakthrough of

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.759
our evolution where you have to get

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.470
connected with the divine you have to

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.689
feel it on your central nervous system

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:54.479
and that's how you get your

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:57.930
self-realization do I perceive here that

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:03.119
this is a way of balancing oneself of

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:05.000
keeping in such a way of living one's

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.079
life in such a way that one is not

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.599
unbalanced in one's view of what is

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.330
going on around us yes we have two sites

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.150
in our system of autonomous nervous

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.580
system

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.920
turn right which he called as left and

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:24.250
right sympathetic nervous system the

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:27.819
left side caters for our emotions for

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:32.170
our past our desires the right side

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:35.560
caters for our actual physical and

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.500
mental if you indulge into one too much

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.190
and go too far with it you develop an

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.440
imbalance within yourself in the center

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.440
lies the third power which we call as

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.359
parasympathetic nervous system this is

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.269
the channel which is the central path of

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:55.930
ascent when the kundalini rises through

00:02:52.269 --> 00:03:00.609
it it brings you in the balance because

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.109
it rises in the center of the system so

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:05.560
this is the minimum that happens that

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:09.970
you developed your balance so how does

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:14.440
one actually achieve this balance it

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.810
just happens one tinniest in other words

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.579
there's no there's no physical

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.690
requirement on an individual not at all

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:25.000
not at all it's a evolutionary step as I

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.370
told you in our evolution we have

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.700
developed a balance we can stand on our

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.190
two legs animals cannot in the same way

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:39.209
you develop this special balance between

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:42.760
your emotions and your actions in a very

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:45.970
proper way you speak as though this is

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.090
some sort of evolutionary step yes it is

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.669
it is the last breakthrough that you

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.819
have to become the spirit now and this

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:57.310
has to be achieved which can be achieved

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.049
only through a living process because we

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.870
have become human beings through a

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:05.260
living process and that living process

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.879
has to act within us the sounds as

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.370
though it is rather a significant time

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:12.519
than in the in the history of humanity

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.370
very much in the history of humanity in

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:18.280
the history of evolution in the history

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.669
of spirituality is the most important

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.150
time because here where you get what

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.889
heaven has been promised to you so far

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.620
so it's no accident

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:32.289
that sahaja yoga has appeared in the

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.389
world at this time no not at all not at

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:37.029
all it's all predicted thousands of

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:39.759
years back in India and later on by many

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:44.080
Saints even William Blake has predicted

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:46.509
it shri mataji you went to russia last

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:53.169
year and I believe the reception you got

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:55.539
was most surprising yes I was myself

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:59.639
surprised because thousands of people

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:01.870
came and very sensible well-educated

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:04.840
people came and they all settle down

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.289
thousands I didn't know how to cope with

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:11.229
that number because there were so many

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:15.580
and even the members of the Supreme

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:20.979
Council the government they came that I

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:24.719
could only say that in the so-called

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:28.319
free societies we waste too much time

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:31.210
experimenting with our freedom and

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:32.770
indulge too much into the politics which

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.889
is a waste thing I think there in

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.629
economics all these things while the

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:40.599
people there didn't have any such

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:44.169
chances so they put their energies to

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:45.610
something that was higher than that they

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.430
diverted and they were very

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.939
knowledgeable they knew a lot about

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:53.529
seeking they knew a lot about Kundalini

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:56.460
and as if they were just waiting for me

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:58.899
it was very de mama

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:02.500
mr. Gorbachev has said the Russians

00:05:58.899 --> 00:06:05.110
require a mental revolution do you see

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:08.469
the acceptance of sahaja yoga as part of

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.990
this revolution of course he himself is

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:14.649
a saint and what he is meaning by mental

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:16.930
then they should now understand that

00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:20.639
they have to develop that balance

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:23.229
between communism and democracy our

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:25.509
democracies are imbalanced they are

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:28.599
one-sided they have no not the other

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:32.819
side of collectivity but communism has

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:38.259
collectivity it is power oriented our

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:40.639
democracies are money-oriented what he

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:45.560
is meaning is the maturity

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:49.599
of all wisdom so yeah referring back to

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.599
what we were talking about earlier is it

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:57.949
okay as we were talking about earlier

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.770
about bringing the human body into

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:02.870
balance could we say then that mr.

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:07.240
Gorbachev is bringing the whole Eastern

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:12.949
Bloc into balance yes yes they had one

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:18.590
too much on one side and he's trying to

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:21.949
bring them in the center you mentioned

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:24.889
that you went to an Eastern Bloc

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:29.050
conference last year and I believe you

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:31.400
gave many influential people realisation

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:33.229
is it true that you believe that this

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.990
was instrumental in helping the

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:39.860
overthrow of oppressive communism it was

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:43.099
a yoga yoga seminar and I expected all

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:45.560
of them to be there and surprisingly I

00:07:43.099 --> 00:07:48.169
talked to them hardly for 30 to 35

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.819
minutes and then I gave them realization

00:07:48.169 --> 00:07:51.589
and all of them got it they were

00:07:49.819 --> 00:07:55.099
representative from all these Eastern

00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:57.860
Bloc countries when they got it

00:07:55.099 --> 00:08:00.680
they're so surprised at it that they

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:02.750
walked out with me out for the hall and

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.819
nobody was left in the hall listen to

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:07.190
other people they gave me their

00:08:04.819 --> 00:08:09.919
addresses and they said we want this

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:11.629
only in our country and they wanted to

00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:16.099
search our centers and I am told they

00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:19.490
have already started centers the

00:08:16.099 --> 00:08:22.279
all-pervading power requires a medium to

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:25.189
trigger something and when these people

00:08:22.279 --> 00:08:27.560
were created as realized Souls as they

00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:28.699
got connected with this all-pervading

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.560
power

00:08:28.699 --> 00:08:35.990
I think they'd record it they had that

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:37.399
confidence that courage in them because

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:39.289
once we realized you become very

00:08:37.399 --> 00:08:42.760
courageous and you want to establish

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:45.829
truth at any cost

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:49.149
similarly the the West shall we call it

00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:53.290
the Western nations have had sahaja yoga

00:08:49.149 --> 00:08:55.630
available to them to to investigate to

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:59.019
to see for themselves how it worked for

00:08:55.630 --> 00:09:02.139
20 years and yet it has been very slow

00:08:59.019 --> 00:09:07.750
to grow why is it happened this way do

00:09:02.139 --> 00:09:11.759
you think here people have so many

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:15.550
diverse ideas about things they are very

00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:18.160
self opinionated also about things and

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:21.190
the so-called man-made religions all

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:23.319
over have also conditioned them too much

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:27.430
they have other conditionings of

00:09:23.319 --> 00:09:31.560
different norms that they have as far as

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:34.509
the social life is concerned and the

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:38.139
physical appearances rather on a very

00:09:34.509 --> 00:09:41.259
superficial level so the people have not

00:09:38.139 --> 00:09:43.120
grown I think so much deeper of course I

00:09:41.259 --> 00:09:47.079
must say there are so many seekers in

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:53.290
the West so many seekers and they were

00:09:47.079 --> 00:09:56.199
lost because as soon as people knew that

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:58.870
there's a market for them the false

00:09:56.199 --> 00:10:02.199
gurus jumped out and they started

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:04.350
preaching about false things just to

00:10:02.199 --> 00:10:07.510
earn money they were all money oriented

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:10.120
now there's another psychology with the

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:12.850
Western mind that you must buy

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:15.819
everything if something is not for sale

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:19.120
then it is useless and this psychology

00:10:15.819 --> 00:10:21.250
has really debted them to come to sahaja

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:23.980
yoga very much because this is a living

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:25.810
process and you cannot pay for it and

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:29.110
they couldn't bear it I mean actually I

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:31.949
must say one of the very important

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:35.050
television gentlemen told me off that

00:10:31.949 --> 00:10:40.449
anglo-saxon brain cannot accept anything

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:42.730
which cannot be sold I didn't know what

00:10:40.449 --> 00:10:45.490
to tell him I just said who has made

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:49.060
this brain his God has made and why is

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:52.779
it so so you have an expectation really

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:53.439
that the syncro sahaja yoga will change

00:10:52.779 --> 00:10:56.290
the world

00:10:53.439 --> 00:10:58.990
of course it changes human beings and

00:10:56.290 --> 00:11:01.120
they manifest the change outside and we

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:03.160
create a new race that's what they're

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.949
talking about if you know they talk of

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.730
new age of a new race but I don't know

00:11:05.949 --> 00:11:09.130
what is there

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:10.990
Nation about it they talk about all this

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:14.320
thing Aquarius and Aquarius is the

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:17.380
Kundalini she is placed in the Aquarius

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:19.360
and they talk about Aquarius and all

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:22.300
kinds of things they're talking writing

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:25.570
thinking about it but when it comes to

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:28.649
actualization I think they think I am

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:32.350
very too simple for them not complicated

00:11:28.649 --> 00:11:35.410
and sahaja Yoga is too simple it should

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:37.660
be very complicated and all their own

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:40.269
ideas about seeking that they must

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:43.029
suffer they must go to Himalayas

00:11:40.269 --> 00:11:47.949
they must starve themselves and then

00:11:43.029 --> 00:11:51.130
only they can get realization Sri Hari

00:11:47.949 --> 00:11:55.870
is the evolution of the planet closely

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:59.740
related to the evolution of humanity and

00:11:55.870 --> 00:12:02.260
he was related and the planet our planet

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:04.329
is moving in a spiral way all the

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:08.070
planets are moving in a spiral way and

00:12:04.329 --> 00:12:11.889
they are creating all possible things

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:15.760
for the use of human beings so that they

00:12:11.889 --> 00:12:17.680
can save time save time for getting

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.800
their ascent and for the meditative

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:25.139
growth but people don't understand that

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:28.029
part there are theories around now that

00:12:25.139 --> 00:12:30.310
the suggestions so we say that the

00:12:28.029 --> 00:12:34.569
planet could be a living organism a

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:36.970
complete entity of course it is one of

00:12:34.569 --> 00:12:41.860
the examples of this one I can give you

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:46.329
is that if you sleep under a coconut

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:49.089
tree a coconut never falls on anything

00:12:46.329 --> 00:12:55.660
that is living whether it is a human

00:12:49.089 --> 00:12:57.910
being or a snake never falls that is so

00:12:55.660 --> 00:13:00.519
is it all around the world coconuts

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:04.449
never fallen and living creatures so

00:13:00.519 --> 00:13:07.060
they understand we call it as Shri Paulo

00:13:04.449 --> 00:13:12.459
because because we think that it is like

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:15.430
a brain which understands well if this

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:17.319
world is a living organism what is the

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:19.449
brain what drives this being this

00:13:17.319 --> 00:13:20.860
organism what has made it evolve the way

00:13:19.449 --> 00:13:23.600
it

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:27.820
there is the subtle power which is

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:31.460
all-pervading love God's love which

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:36.890
manifests all the things like living

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:38.030
work all nourishment all balancing it's

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:41.690
so balanced

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:46.550
if the Pacific was slightly deeper than

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:53.000
this there would have been problems if

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:54.680
Himalaya was safe one and a half times

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.370
then what it is there would have been

00:13:54.680 --> 00:14:01.790
problems so everything is so balanced in

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:04.730
nature hmm and the Almighty has created

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:07.730
only one word only we human beings have

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:11.720
divided and moved like criminals with

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:14.440
our passports in our hands Shri Mata

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:17.840
Hari what we have been talking about

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:20.720
many people would regard as a belief or

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:23.560
a theory how does one know that the

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:26.300
difference between truth and a belief

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:28.970
first of all anything for which you have

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:31.730
to pay money is not the truth you can't

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:36.380
pay for it if you cancel out that I

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:41.630
think 99.9% all the falsehood will drop

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:45.950
out but truth to be really actualized

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:48.980
you have to have self realization then

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:50.870
you feel on your fingertips vibratory

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:53.420
awareness a new awareness a new

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:55.990
dimension awareness by which you can

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:59.840
make out what is true and what is false

00:14:55.990 --> 00:15:03.860
that's an absolute truth that you

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:06.110
realize at that stage so one must have

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:08.840
one's realization really to be able to

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:12.860
tell the truth you want to follow anyone

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:16.150
one must have realizes shri mataji thank

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:16.150
you very much thank

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:25.640
you know they are doing one thing doing

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:26.930
one another I was reading an article

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:30.050
just now where you were talking about

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:32.660
inner peace and outer peace this seems

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:34.670
to be something that attracts the

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:43.720
attention of people in this present

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:48.140
stressful age my realization what have

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:50.230
you become a person and out with

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:54.560
thoughtless awareness

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:57.470
that means you see everything you

00:15:54.560 --> 00:16:02.890
witness everything and whenever you want

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:07.630
to say or to think you can see about it

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:20.090
but you don't react there's no reaction

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:24.110
so you are empowered to see it in such a

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:29.680
manner that there need not be any

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:32.960
thought just the whole creation actually

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:37.430
it's a very subtle thing is to be

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:40.130
experienced and that is the point where

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:43.370
we realize that we are the source of

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:45.800
peace and that's how our inner peace is

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:47.960
established now people have many

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:50.240
foundations of peace I have known all of

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:52.600
them they have no peace within

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:55.190
themselves some people have got peace

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:58.100
Awards there are horribly hot-tempered

00:16:55.190 --> 00:17:03.380
people but they have got to be some odds

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:05.270
Nobel Prizes the peace has to be first

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:11.360
of all found inside and then it

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:14.090
manifests outside you know the another

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:18.830
question we wanted to ask you is because

00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:20.959
of this rather useful way you use your

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:23.870
hands to describe the movement of the

00:17:20.959 --> 00:17:26.209
chakra when they when they they part I

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:28.820
wonder if you could just explain why

00:17:26.209 --> 00:17:29.390
when illness occurs it occurs because of

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:31.340
the

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:34.789
the movement away of one center from

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:36.470
another alright what I try to show them

00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:38.840
that this is the left side this is the

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:40.970
right side this is the left sympathetic

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:43.519
nervous system say and this is the right

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:46.610
sympathetic nervous system and really

00:17:43.519 --> 00:17:49.909
spinal cord looks like this and inside

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:53.419
here is the spinal cord which has the

00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:56.299
centers in it the subtle centers now

00:17:53.419 --> 00:18:00.169
when you start using the energy of these

00:17:56.299 --> 00:18:03.590
centers say too much on the right and it

00:18:00.169 --> 00:18:06.080
starts moving more towards the right and

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:08.980
there's a constriction and the power

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:10.970
becomes less because you are exhausting

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:13.909
going more towards the right side

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:17.000
suddenly something happens and from the

00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:19.789
left if there's a jerk then the

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.279
connection is completely broken this is

00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:25.340
on its own it starts working on its own

00:18:22.279 --> 00:18:28.279
that's what you say that this has become

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:31.010
malignant I have no relationship with

00:18:28.279 --> 00:18:33.409
the whole to have the proportionate

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:36.440
growth so if the nose starts developing

00:18:33.409 --> 00:18:38.990
it can cover your eyes and govern your

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:41.840
mouth everything this is how a cancer is

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:44.419
setting or any other disease there's so

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:47.299
many psychosomatic diseases are nothing

00:18:44.419 --> 00:18:50.299
but somatic he is from the right side

00:18:47.299 --> 00:18:52.789
and when the psyche gives in then it

00:18:50.299 --> 00:18:55.340
becomes a psychosomatic disease there

00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:59.389
are so many diseases which are more

00:18:55.340 --> 00:19:02.210
psychosomatic than physical and these we

00:18:59.389 --> 00:19:05.720
call them as incurable can be easily

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:08.299
cured by Kundalini awakening because

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:10.669
when Kundalini passes through this she

00:19:08.299 --> 00:19:13.059
just integrates them for example she is

00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:17.389
going like this then she goes into this

00:19:13.059 --> 00:19:21.769
integrates them just like she strings

00:19:17.389 --> 00:19:24.620
them like pearls and so they are brought

00:19:21.769 --> 00:19:27.130
down and also she nourishes that Center

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:29.330
that's what people get cured

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:35.950
automatically by themselves by their own

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:38.710
power Shri Mataji you ready

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:41.500
she mythology do you want to speak to

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:43.870
the IBC in Adelaide afternoon or would

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:51.730
you rather that I rang them and said

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:54.250
you're too busy abrupt yes I've been a

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:58.120
lot of problems there abrupt and also

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:59.560
very flippant I don't think they said

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:03.970
they wanted to talk to you about false

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:09.700
gurus and woke a few seconds what just

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:10.990
do what all right they've been having a

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:14.380
little trouble this morning you know we

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:16.330
have banners to put up announcing your

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:18.280
program tonight and they we had them on

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:20.620
various bridges and I kept chasing them

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:25.990
away but we finally found a place where

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:30.220
they've allowed them to stay another

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:32.740
piece that must be busy with big exits

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:35.110
oh yes it's all very reserved places for

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:36.640
addictions yes also if it was for the

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:39.550
election it would be able to go up

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:41.520
anywhere but if it's anything else

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:46.200
they're not so happy

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:46.200
that's was the attention enough
