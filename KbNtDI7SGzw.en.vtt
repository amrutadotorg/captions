01:13.430 --> 01:16.390
Easter Puja
Istanbul, Turkey

01:16.390 --> 01:18.610
April 19, 1998

01:18.610 --> 01:24.540
Today we are celebrating the resurrection
of Christ.

01:24.540 --> 01:32.220
That is the greatest message of Christ's life,
not the crucifixion.

01:32.220 --> 01:49.080
Anybody can be crucified and killed, but this
dead body of Christ was resurrected from death.

01:49.080 --> 01:56.840
Death itself died, and He overcome it.

01:56.840 --> 02:13.020
It's a miracle for ordinary human beings,
definitely, but not for Christ, because He

02:13.020 --> 02:15.070
was a Divine person.

02:15.070 --> 02:24.130
He was Shri Ganesha, He was Omkara Itself.

02:24.130 --> 02:34.670
So He could walk on the water, gravity would
not affect Him.

02:34.670 --> 02:43.460
And also He got resurrected because death
could not affect Him.

02:43.460 --> 02:56.400
Such a great Divine personality, specially
created for human beings, that people should

02:56.400 --> 02:57.610
recognize Him.

02:57.610 --> 03:01.740
But they did not recognize Him.

03:01.740 --> 03:08.420
They killed Him in a very brutal manner.

03:08.420 --> 03:19.930
And even now they think cross is a great thing
because Christ died on the cross.

03:19.930 --> 03:28.310
It's a very cruel idea of human beings to
respect the cross.

03:28.310 --> 03:31.049
What does it show?

03:31.049 --> 03:48.500
It shows that people liked all the cruelties
done to Him, symbolizing cross as the one

03:48.500 --> 03:58.639
that represented His death and His atrocities,
the way He was tortured.

03:58.639 --> 04:08.440
So it was a very sad time when He was crucified.

04:08.440 --> 04:19.760
But when He got resurrected, it was the most
joyous, most auspicious and most beautiful

04:19.760 --> 04:20.760
time.

04:20.760 --> 04:33.270
The resurrection of Christ is very symbolic
for Sahaja Yoga.

04:33.270 --> 04:45.680
If Christ could be resurrected, then human
beings also can be resurrected, because He

04:45.680 --> 04:54.840
came as a human being with all powers, and
He created the path of resurrection for us.

04:54.840 --> 05:03.460
This path of resurrection is the one that
we have followed in Sahaja Yoga.

05:03.460 --> 05:13.150
But the greatest thing is the piercing of
the Agnya Chakra which is described in all

05:13.150 --> 05:27.610
spiritual treatise, or may be called as the
scriptures, that that is the door which is

05:27.610 --> 05:38.080
golden, which is like a cover, and no one
can pass through that, so constricted is this

05:38.080 --> 05:41.169
door of Agnya Chakra.

05:41.169 --> 05:45.720
But Christ did cross that.

05:45.720 --> 05:57.110
His crossing has helped us today to
open your Agnya.

05:57.110 --> 06:02.889
Without opening the Agnya you cannot go to
Sahasrara.

06:02.889 --> 06:12.620
And this was done so easily in your case,
only because Christ could go through all that

06:12.620 --> 06:19.010
torture and all that brutality, and crossed
over.

06:19.010 --> 06:29.539
How much we should be indebted to Him, I don't
know words that can express, because He is

06:29.539 --> 06:36.139
the One who took lead in telling people that
“You seek.

06:36.139 --> 06:39.240
You seek and you'll find.”

06:39.240 --> 06:48.509
And then He says that “You have to come
and bang at the door.”

06:48.509 --> 06:56.930
This is exactly what has happened in your
case, that you have risen up to Agnya and

06:56.930 --> 07:00.580
then you have crossed beyond Agnya.

07:00.580 --> 07:11.370
This crossing of Agnya was not at all difficult
for you, though by your own ideas of thinking

07:11.370 --> 07:18.949
and of conditioning, of the futuristic planning
and all that, it was a big, big crowd, I should

07:18.949 --> 07:26.669
say, of very black clouds were hovering on
the Agnya.

07:26.669 --> 07:35.819
Your thoughts were overpowering you, and you
could not have penetrated through this Agnya

07:35.819 --> 07:38.229
which was all covered.

07:38.229 --> 07:44.990
But you did, and you never even felt that
you have crossed the Agnya Chakra so easily.

07:44.990 --> 07:53.939
The first of all, we all should really be
very thankful to Christ for opening the Agnya

07:53.939 --> 07:55.280
for you.

07:55.280 --> 08:05.639
For Him all the tortures and all the brutality
were nothing, because His purpose of life,

08:05.639 --> 08:14.060
His purpose of His advent, His incarnation,
was to break the Agnya Chakra.

08:14.060 --> 08:22.159
Today you will find that even though your
Agnya is opened out and you have crossed through,

08:22.159 --> 08:33.979
still you'll be amazed that people get involved
in the Agnya Chakra.

08:33.979 --> 08:39.090
In Sahaja Yoga people do get involved in Agnya
Chakra.

08:39.090 --> 08:46.080
Now how do we see through introspection what
happens to us?

08:46.080 --> 08:58.970
For example, once people come to Sahaja Yoga,
they think they are in charge: in charge of

08:58.970 --> 09:08.690
this, in charge of that, in charge of all
the Sahaja Yogis; and they start behaving

09:08.690 --> 09:14.570
in a manner which doesn't behove a Sahaja
Yogi.

09:14.570 --> 09:16.310
It doesn't.

09:16.310 --> 09:24.530
I've seen them, and I really am amused the
way they just start thrusting themselves and

09:24.530 --> 09:30.300
showing off that they are very much in charge.

09:30.300 --> 09:33.090
This is nothing modern.

09:33.090 --> 09:38.430
This is used to be there with human beings.

09:38.430 --> 09:46.089
But if it was so, it was before Sahaja Yoga.

09:46.089 --> 09:55.130
Even now people get into the mood of dominating
others by saying that “We are in charge.”

09:55.130 --> 10:02.710
Sahaja Yoga is not so simple as you think,
because there are lots of temptations.

10:02.710 --> 10:05.190
Supposing you make somebody a leader.

10:05.190 --> 10:17.570
Now a leader becomes sort of “in charge,”
you know, and he gets the drunkenness of power.

10:17.570 --> 10:29.730
When he's like that he starts dominating all
the rest of the people, and also starts showing

10:29.730 --> 10:43.600
off that he's something very great and he
has to dominate all the rest of the people.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.680
Then he creates an atmosphere of fear.

10:45.680 --> 10:52.360
Firstly, I've seen what happens with them
is that they start saying falsely that “Mother

10:52.360 --> 10:58.000
has told this, Mother has said so, this is
Mother's ideas.”

10:58.000 --> 11:02.320
I have nothing to do with that gentleman,
but he goes on talking like that, and people

11:02.320 --> 11:03.889
get very frightened.

11:03.889 --> 11:10.390
Then also he can also frighten you by saying,
“I will tell Mother.

11:10.390 --> 11:15.519
Mother will listen to me and She'll punish
you.”

11:15.519 --> 11:22.730
I am sometimes very surprised at such people,
because I have never said that I'll punish

11:22.730 --> 11:29.589
somebody or I'll take him out of Sahaja Yoga
- nothing of the kind.

11:29.589 --> 11:34.209
So this man who thinks no end of himself,
he may be a leader, may not be a leader, may

11:34.209 --> 11:43.779
be nothing in Sahaja Yoga; and then if he
starts talking like this in such a funny manner

11:43.779 --> 11:48.430
that it doesn't look that the person is a
Sahaja Yogi.

11:48.430 --> 11:55.120
Then he goes even further.

11:55.120 --> 12:05.709
He goes himself describing as something very
great, as if he's the one who is chosen specially

12:05.709 --> 12:08.630
for rising higher and higher.

12:08.630 --> 12:12.589
When I hear about these things I'm really
amazed.

12:12.589 --> 12:23.399
How can people befool themselves all the time,
and behave in such a manner?

12:23.399 --> 12:26.920
First thing in Sahaja Yoga is humility.

12:26.920 --> 12:31.172
If you are not a humble person, you cannot
be a Sahaja Yogi.

12:31.172 --> 12:40.961
The person who orders about, the person who
talks in a manner as if he is Hitler, any

12:40.961 --> 12:51.421
person who tries to control and be in charge
of the thing, all these capacities only show

12:51.421 --> 12:57.269
that that person has achieved nothing in Sahaja
Yoga.

12:57.269 --> 13:01.560
First thing is to enjoy the humility.

13:01.560 --> 13:07.259
I've seen people like this, they'll always
sit in the first row.

13:07.259 --> 13:11.120
They'll be always sitting in a place where
you just see them all the time there.

13:11.120 --> 13:12.860
I just smile.

13:12.860 --> 13:16.330
I know they are just show-offs.

13:16.330 --> 13:20.889
They think no end of themselves, and that's
why they are there.

13:20.889 --> 13:26.870
But they themselves are losing, they themselves
are not very happy.

13:26.870 --> 13:33.680
That's why they try to do all these tricks
and this kind of domination.

13:33.680 --> 13:48.720
The other side of it is people who are humble,
who are simple, who are honest and who are

13:48.720 --> 13:54.160
really seeking the truth, are being oppressed
by this gentleman.

13:54.160 --> 14:02.790
He oppresses them, tries to show off, tries
to make slaves out of others.

14:02.790 --> 14:14.170
I have seen people have gone so far that there
was a group of people who just would not move

14:14.170 --> 14:19.399
even an inch without the permission of their
leader.

14:19.399 --> 14:27.540
And they would go all out to be subservient
to such a irrational personality.

14:27.540 --> 14:34.709
First of all, you know this is the love of
Mother.

14:34.709 --> 14:37.350
Mother never dominates.

14:37.350 --> 14:41.920
She cannot dominate, because She is nothing
but love.

14:41.920 --> 14:48.630
As soon as She sees the problem, immediately
She absorbs it.

14:48.630 --> 14:56.990
She has to make deliberations, just a drama
sometimes to show that She's angry.

14:56.990 --> 15:00.790
But She cannot basically be angry with anyone.

15:00.790 --> 15:08.010
It's the love which all the time, all the
time is flowing.

15:08.010 --> 15:12.150
And that love envelops the Mother, as well
as envelops you.

15:12.150 --> 15:17.029
That is how you people will understand Sahaja
Yoga.

15:17.029 --> 15:22.029
What does a human being need is nothing but
love and compassion, love and compassion of

15:22.029 --> 15:27.490
a very, very pure type.

15:27.490 --> 15:32.720
Look at Christ.

15:32.720 --> 15:36.660
He pitied the people who crucified Him.

15:36.660 --> 15:43.610
He told His Father, the God Almighty, that
“Please forgive them, because they do not

15:43.610 --> 15:45.910
know what they are doing.”

15:45.910 --> 15:53.290
He could see that the blindness of these people
are doing wrong things, and God the Father

15:53.290 --> 15:58.020
will be very annoyed, Who is wrathful and
may destroy them.

15:58.020 --> 16:11.560
So this is what it was done with a very compassionate
feeling, without thinking about, just automatically

16:11.560 --> 16:20.810
He felt that these people are doing all this
to Me, and I don't know what will happen to

16:20.810 --> 16:22.250
them.

16:22.250 --> 16:24.769
So He prayed to God, to Father, “Please
forgive.

16:24.769 --> 16:27.949
Please forgive them, for they do not know
what they are doing.

16:27.949 --> 16:31.570
They are blind, so please do not punish them.”

16:31.570 --> 16:32.620
What compassion!

16:32.620 --> 16:33.660
What love!

16:33.660 --> 16:40.759
I mean, think of it: do we do that in our
life?

16:40.759 --> 16:49.529
If somebody harms us, troubles us, do we ask
Father to forgive those who do not know what

16:49.529 --> 16:50.529
they are doing?

16:50.529 --> 16:56.970
That should be the level of Sahaja Yoga, and
it will work out very well.

16:56.970 --> 17:04.240
If you ask for forgiveness, God will look
after them, He’ll transform them, He'll

17:04.240 --> 17:07.959
bring them to their senses.

17:07.959 --> 17:19.130
The message of Christ are full of love, compassion,
pure compassion.

17:19.130 --> 17:27.210
How He tried to protect Mary Magdalene is
an example of that, who was leading a sinful

17:27.210 --> 17:33.690
life; and for a saint it had nothing to do,
He had nothing to do with her.

17:33.690 --> 17:41.540
But when He saw she being stoned by people,
He stood against her, took a stone in His

17:41.540 --> 17:52.500
own hand, and He says, “All right, those
who have not committed any wrong deed or have

17:52.500 --> 17:58.330
not committed any sin, can take this stone
and hit Me.”

17:58.330 --> 18:05.510
And nobody came forward, because they had
to face themselves.

18:05.510 --> 18:18.590
When we are dominating others, then a kind
of a cruel joy is there, some sort of a joy

18:18.590 --> 18:23.670
that I don't understand Myself, but people
have.

18:23.670 --> 18:32.200
They show off that we have achieved this joy,
we have achieved this great power.

18:32.200 --> 18:42.740
It has happened for centuries, with all the
great emperors and also despotic rulers.

18:42.740 --> 18:47.720
But with Sahaja Yogis it should be the other
way round.

18:47.720 --> 18:55.820
They have to rule the world with peace and
love.

18:55.820 --> 18:59.360
They don't have to show off, by any chance.

18:59.360 --> 19:03.360
This is how Sahaja Yoga will spread much,
much fast.

19:03.360 --> 19:09.500
What does the world need? - you just think
of it.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.180
It needs only love and affection.

19:11.180 --> 19:24.580
Those people who are yet lost in the ignorance
about life and are still busy troubling others,

19:24.580 --> 19:33.260
torturing others, going against the collectivity,
will have to return to normalcy.

19:33.260 --> 19:39.220
It’s very abnormal behavior sometimes, and
you just don’t understand why they behave

19:39.220 --> 19:40.220
like mad people.

19:40.220 --> 19:51.770
It is very difficult also to tell such a person
that “You are mad.”

19:51.770 --> 19:59.650
And also it’s difficult to be with such
a person who is so mad with some sort of a

19:59.650 --> 20:00.900
power.

20:00.900 --> 20:06.190
It goes on like that with so many Sahaja Yogis,
I have seen, who start thinking they have

20:06.190 --> 20:15.370
lots of powers, they can do whatever they
like, they can talk to anyone and they can

20:15.370 --> 20:16.870
confuse everyone.

20:16.870 --> 20:26.700
But in Sahaja Yoga you don’t have to confuse,
you have to clearly express your love.

20:26.700 --> 20:34.130
But that doesn’t mean any kind of a particular
gesture or a particular happening, but it

20:34.130 --> 20:41.660
is just a inner oneness with each other.

20:41.660 --> 20:56.400
Is, sometimes I find Sahaja Yogis so much
understanding each other, so much loving each

20:56.400 --> 21:04.010
other, so beautifully enjoying the love of
other people.

21:04.010 --> 21:11.530
When I see that I feel very, very happy, absolutely
overjoyed.

21:11.530 --> 21:20.920
That’s what I wanted: these people should
enjoy, is there.

21:20.920 --> 21:28.810
And you’ll be amazed, the most enjoyable
thing is the love that you give to others.

21:28.810 --> 21:36.120
You may not receive, but when you give love
to others, then it’s the most enjoyable

21:36.120 --> 21:37.120
thing.

21:37.120 --> 21:49.220
But the way you express yourself is also an
art, I think, to understand how to please

21:49.220 --> 21:52.150
others, how to make them happy.

21:52.150 --> 21:57.980
I've told this story before also, about a
saint who lived in Gaganbhoura, is a, what

21:57.980 --> 22:04.420
you can say is a hill or a mountain.

22:04.420 --> 22:13.950
He used to live there and he couldn't walk,
you see: because of vibrations he lost his

22:13.950 --> 22:18.990
legs or something, the power in them.

22:18.990 --> 22:27.750
And then he would go all over the place on
a tiger, because tiger loved him and he loved

22:27.750 --> 22:29.590
the tiger.

22:29.590 --> 22:37.680
So this gentleman was all the time telling
people from Bombay, “What are you doing

22:37.680 --> 22:38.680
here?

22:38.680 --> 22:39.680
Mother has come!

22:39.680 --> 22:41.470
Go and touch Her Feet.”

22:41.470 --> 22:47.560
I didn't know why he was so much concerned.

22:47.560 --> 22:50.910
So I told Sahaja Yogis, “I must go and meet
him.”

22:50.910 --> 22:58.050
So all these gurus, you see, they say that
“We don't leave our pillows.

22:58.050 --> 23:04.400
We have to be in our own pillow” - means
wherever they live, they exist, they won't

23:04.400 --> 23:05.400
go out.

23:05.400 --> 23:08.590
I'm the other way round.

23:08.590 --> 23:12.380
I'm never stationed in one place, you see.

23:12.380 --> 23:15.340
So they asked if I could go.

23:15.340 --> 23:17.450
I said, “Why not?”

23:17.450 --> 23:22.280
So I went there, and the Sahaja Yogis said
that “Mother, You never go anywhere, so

23:22.280 --> 23:25.600
why do You want to go here?”

23:25.600 --> 23:34.200
I said, “All right, see the vibrations,”
and it’s tremendous vibrations.

23:34.200 --> 23:39.450
So when I went up, this fellow was very angry
with the rain because he was supposed to control

23:39.450 --> 23:43.440
the rain, he was supposed to be controlling
the rain.

23:43.440 --> 23:54.290
It's very surprising that when I went up,
he could not control and I got completely

23:54.290 --> 23:55.290
drenched.

23:55.290 --> 23:58.920
So he was very angry.

23:58.920 --> 24:05.470
He was sitting on a stone, you know, and he
was going like this with anger.

24:05.470 --> 24:06.650
I didn't say anything to him.

24:06.650 --> 24:17.600
I went inside and sat in the cave, where he
had made some arrangement for Me to be seated.

24:17.600 --> 24:25.070
Then he came, he touched My Feet, and he sat
down.

24:25.070 --> 24:33.260
And I was amazed that he was still angry and
he couldn't understand why the rain could

24:33.260 --> 24:34.260
not stop.

24:34.260 --> 24:40.770
So he asked Me, “Why did You not allow me
to stop that rain?

24:40.770 --> 24:48.590
Because after all You are coming to see me
all the way, and the rain should have behaved.

24:48.590 --> 24:54.500
And I also could not somehow or other control
the rain, so what was the thing, what was

24:54.500 --> 24:55.500
the lesson?”

24:55.500 --> 24:56.980
I just smiled.

24:56.980 --> 25:04.930
I said, “See, you are an ascetic, you are
a sanyasi, and I am your Mother.

25:04.930 --> 25:13.520
I cannot take a sari from you because after
all you are a sanyasi, and you are not supposed

25:13.520 --> 25:16.540
to take anything from a sanyasi.”

25:16.540 --> 25:22.530
Even the Mother cannot take anything from
him.

25:22.530 --> 25:26.260
“But you have bought a nice sari for Me.

25:26.260 --> 25:31.820
So I had to get drenched so that I could take
a sari from you.”

25:31.820 --> 25:37.120
You see, the sweetness of My telling him just
made him melt down.

25:37.120 --> 25:39.530
He started crying.

25:39.530 --> 25:46.510
He said, “We need a Mother for this world.

25:46.510 --> 25:48.672
There should be the Mother.

25:48.672 --> 25:56.790
We cannot solve it, because whatever it is,
we get angry or we want to disappear.

25:56.790 --> 26:08.350
We don't want to be with these horrible people
who are so sinful, to help them.”

26:08.350 --> 26:14.660
This is the problem with the world today,
and that's why you find very few spiritual

26:14.660 --> 26:18.670
people in the whole world.

26:18.670 --> 26:26.900
Because they are the ones who are being very
much tortured, troubled, insulted, all kinds

26:26.900 --> 26:30.900
of things happen.

26:30.900 --> 26:35.630
So they're struggling, struggling, so they
want to die very fast.

26:35.630 --> 26:46.330
Gyaneshwara, such a great personality, such
a great writer, poet, I mean he was everything,

26:46.330 --> 26:49.190
so beautifully he has written.

26:49.190 --> 26:56.350
But at the age of twenty-three he took his
samadhi, means he went into a cave, and closed

26:56.350 --> 26:59.000
the cave and died there.

26:59.000 --> 27:07.550
Must have been tired and fed up with the surroundings
of ignorant people, and that's why he did.

27:07.550 --> 27:17.280
So you can imagine a person like Gyaneshwara,
who was the incarnation of Kartikeya, had

27:17.280 --> 27:26.800
to recede into the world of the dead because
he couldn't bear it any more the way they

27:26.800 --> 27:28.210
were torturing them.

27:28.210 --> 27:38.280
They tortured him so much, saying that he
is the son of a sanyasi and he has, I mean

27:38.280 --> 27:48.280
it's like this: “son of a sanyasi” means
he is no good, he is absolutely like an illegitimate

27:48.280 --> 27:55.690
child; and he is ill-treated to such an extent,
he didn't even have shoes to wear in that

27:55.690 --> 27:56.770
heat of India.

27:56.770 --> 27:58.560
He used to walk bare feet.

27:58.560 --> 28:06.210
And his sister, brother, who were great scholars,
who were great saints, great incarnations,

28:06.210 --> 28:07.790
all of themself.

28:07.790 --> 28:16.910
As a result he wanted just to disappear, and
he made a beautiful way of doing it, that

28:16.910 --> 28:24.620
he told them that “I have to go,” and
he took leave from them and went inside his

28:24.620 --> 28:29.620
cave, and got his samadhi.

28:29.620 --> 28:35.520
Even Christ was very young when He was crucified.

28:35.520 --> 28:41.600
He was thirty-three years of age.

28:41.600 --> 28:58.780
It was all planned by the Divine that He was
to be crucified, to make way for our Sahaja

28:58.780 --> 29:10.190
Yoga: to open the Agnya, to sacrifice His
life, and for Him to be hanged in such a horrendous,

29:10.190 --> 29:20.180
cruel way, which normally you do not find
people behaving in such a manner towards a

29:20.180 --> 29:23.040
person who is about to die.

29:23.040 --> 29:31.850
So what happened, that those people who were
in charge of His crucifixion must have been

29:31.850 --> 29:35.500
some devils, the way they behaved.

29:35.500 --> 29:43.550
It is not possible to forgive them even if
He, Christ says; it's difficult to forgive

29:43.550 --> 29:49.430
such people who were watching the crucifixion
of Christ.

29:49.430 --> 30:07.740
So if that is the case that a person like
Him thought that “Let Me do My job, is to

30:07.740 --> 30:11.270
break Sahasrara.”

30:11.270 --> 30:18.710
And then He didn't want to live, live with
these stupid people to be tortured, and He

30:18.710 --> 30:25.890
just disappeared into Kashmir, where He lived
after His resurrection.

30:25.890 --> 30:38.470
Lots of stories are there about His ascent
and His resurrection, and you see, all those

30:38.470 --> 30:45.870
stories if you read, you'll be amazed how
miraculously He got His second birth, you

30:45.870 --> 30:50.980
can say, or second life in Kashmir.

30:50.980 --> 30:58.870
He lived in Kashmir happily for some time
with His Mother, and there He died.

30:58.870 --> 31:08.090
They say there's a grave of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and also His Mother who was there.

31:08.090 --> 31:15.080
But who has taken advantage of His life, from
His life?

31:15.080 --> 31:16.080
Who are the people really who wanted Him to
die?

31:16.080 --> 31:21.970
You know very well.

31:21.970 --> 31:41.700
You know very well how Christ died, and the
people came up suddenly, like Paul and Peter,

31:41.700 --> 31:44.300
who tried to make a big business out of it.

31:44.300 --> 31:58.220
It's very sad to see that these two persons
brought such a shame.

31:58.220 --> 32:04.370
This Paul was nothing but an organizer, I
think, also a beginner.

32:04.370 --> 32:09.270
You see, he was a person who was bureaucratic,
I should say.

32:09.270 --> 32:15.670
But he was not only bureaucratic, he was also
a man who wanted to have a big position.

32:15.670 --> 32:28.640
So he told a lie that he went down to Damascus,
and on his way, on his way he saw a big cross.

32:28.640 --> 32:38.640
According to Sahaja Yoga all such signs are
a sign of supra-conscious, is not of the Spirit.

32:38.640 --> 32:45.610
And then he came back and he started his own
research, and sort of things like that.

32:45.610 --> 32:48.010
And he's written a lot of things.

32:48.010 --> 32:58.360
But throughout if you read, you'll find that
he was not a Sahaja Yogi, he was just an organizer.

32:58.360 --> 33:04.890
He was a bureaucratic personality who was
writing how we should administer, how we should

33:04.890 --> 33:13.750
have people who are different types of people,
how should we manage them.

33:13.750 --> 33:15.990
So he's management department.

33:15.990 --> 33:19.660
He was the management department for the Christians.

33:19.660 --> 33:29.380
So the Christians also became extremely, very
secretariat type: like you see, everything

33:29.380 --> 33:37.040
has a time, you must come like this, you must
sit like this, must talk like this.

33:37.040 --> 33:44.420
And also the nations which are supposed to
be Christians are observing all that in a

33:44.420 --> 33:46.280
very official manner.

33:46.280 --> 34:02.710
It is not understood why, why are they so
much official in everything?

34:02.710 --> 34:11.280
Just the opposite what Christ did, is to break
the Agnya, they built up this.

34:11.280 --> 34:18.800
And the Christian nations became the most
arrogant, most aggressive nations in the whole

34:18.800 --> 34:19.800
world.

34:19.800 --> 34:25.600
For them, it was their right to occupy any
land they saw.

34:25.600 --> 34:36.409
It was in their right to establish their own
laws, their own, I should say, assemblies.

34:36.409 --> 34:39.770
All this is done in India, I know.

34:39.770 --> 34:50.280
Even today if you go to places like Punjab
and all that, you'll find the people are just

34:50.280 --> 35:04.770
living like rustic people working very hard,
and they are all the time under attack from

35:04.770 --> 35:17.440
people who are dominating, and those who wanted
the full advantage to be taken out of these

35:17.440 --> 35:20.339
people.

35:20.339 --> 35:28.569
It was a ridiculous thing to behave like that
as Christians.

35:28.569 --> 35:32.609
Then also they started converting people.

35:32.609 --> 35:36.690
It's another nonsense, converting.

35:36.690 --> 35:41.630
Converting them in the south, in the...

35:41.630 --> 35:48.089
What they did is to - we Indians never make
breads; they don't know how to use an oven

35:48.089 --> 35:49.269
in the south.

35:49.269 --> 35:56.810
So they made huge, big cakes - you can call
it a cake or you can call it a bread - and

35:56.810 --> 36:06.819
put it in the water or in a well, and they
would say that we have put the part of the

36:06.819 --> 36:15.079
calf of a buffalo or could be a cow, or something
like that.

36:15.079 --> 36:18.260
And they just believed them.

36:18.260 --> 36:24.619
And so they said, “Now you are finished,
because you're no more belonging to Hindu

36:24.619 --> 36:27.469
religion or to any other religion.

36:27.469 --> 36:29.839
So now you have become Christian.”

36:29.839 --> 36:38.310
And that's how they made thousands and thousands
of people Christians who were actually downtrodden

36:38.310 --> 36:43.349
people, I should say - at least, they would
call themselves downtrodden.

36:43.349 --> 36:52.990
Now all these downtrodden people, they wanted
to have converted to Christianity, because

36:52.990 --> 37:07.940
they thought - you see, it is, they all wanted
all such people who would just follow the

37:07.940 --> 37:14.299
missionaries, and who would not question.

37:14.299 --> 37:22.299
Because they were not educated people, they're
not people of any understanding or intelligence

37:22.299 --> 37:25.140
to understand what these people are.

37:25.140 --> 37:33.000
So when they started this tirade against the
downtrodden people, so many of them joined.

37:33.000 --> 37:44.589
Thus they formed their own race and they started
their religion there.

37:44.589 --> 37:51.309
This is a thing one should understand, how
the dominating nature of people accepted a

37:51.309 --> 38:00.299
particular religion, because that religion
is nothing but humility.

38:00.299 --> 38:10.319
And how then these people supposed to be in
charge of Christianity, converted people into

38:10.319 --> 38:12.730
something absurd.

38:12.730 --> 38:24.230
You see it is a human nature, it can enjoy
any nonsense, any kind of cruelty, any kind

38:24.230 --> 38:25.529
of oppression.

38:25.529 --> 38:34.480
It can never give up that realm, that area
where they have been dominating.

38:34.480 --> 38:44.750
Now as it is, the Christian nations have gone
even beyond that, because among the Christians

38:44.750 --> 38:48.270
it is all the freedom given to them.

38:48.270 --> 38:49.450
They're liberated.

38:49.450 --> 38:55.349
Do whatever you may like, if you will become
Christian.

38:55.349 --> 38:58.300
They're all right, isn’t it?

38:58.300 --> 39:06.359
They are the ones who have been dominating,
and those who are dominated are there everywhere.

39:06.359 --> 39:16.589
They would go to people, ordinary people whom
you can call as aboriginals, and convert them.

39:16.589 --> 39:18.880
Theirs main method was to convert.

39:18.880 --> 39:23.130
What was the need to convert so many people?

39:23.130 --> 39:29.410
Because in democracy it is important that
the number you have should be large.

39:29.410 --> 39:38.049
So to gain the number, they used to convert.

39:38.049 --> 39:44.279
And they have ruined so many people.

39:44.279 --> 39:55.119
It’s really, the whole situation of Christ
really makes Me feel very nervous.

39:55.119 --> 39:58.799
Today you all are Sahaja Yogis.

39:58.799 --> 40:05.309
You are all so much higher than others.

40:05.309 --> 40:11.200
You have all the powers.

40:11.200 --> 40:19.200
And then supposing you want to behave like
the Christians, I don't know what you will

40:19.200 --> 40:20.200
do.

40:20.200 --> 40:29.130
So now you are on the verge where Sahaja Yoga
is accepted in different countries, and there

40:29.130 --> 40:36.759
people respect people who are Sahaja Yogis,
they have given positions.

40:36.759 --> 40:44.779
Then suddenly you might get this power business
into your head and you may try, you may try

40:44.779 --> 40:54.410
to become like a despot, because that is human
nature.

40:54.410 --> 41:00.400
That's not divine, but that's a human nature.

41:00.400 --> 41:14.450
For example, when in the kingdom of, we can
say of the animals, they are aggressive on

41:14.450 --> 41:19.690
each other, it's all right, it's permitted,
it is done.

41:19.690 --> 41:25.220
But there's a system, there's a way, there's
a method how they dominate.

41:25.220 --> 41:28.460
It's not like this: they jump on everyone.

41:28.460 --> 41:34.520
But I've seen in Sahaja Yoga many people,
you make them a leader - finished.

41:34.520 --> 41:37.799
Then he sits on everybody's head.

41:37.799 --> 41:42.210
If you don't make them a leader then they
go on writing letters to Me, one after another,

41:42.210 --> 41:45.430
that “Mother, we want to be leader.

41:45.430 --> 41:47.800
I want to be a leader.”

41:47.800 --> 41:50.910
Like this they go on insisting on this.

41:50.910 --> 41:55.400
For what do you want to be the leader?

41:55.400 --> 41:57.800
Just to dominate others.

41:57.800 --> 42:03.089
And this domination business is not meant
for Sahaja Yoga.

42:03.089 --> 42:16.099
I am here today to tell you about, about a
beautiful image of Christ, who rose above

42:16.099 --> 42:17.240
death.

42:17.240 --> 42:34.549
In the same way let the death of all nonsensical
ideas, all negative thoughts, everything has

42:34.549 --> 42:38.160
to be overcome.

42:38.160 --> 42:47.119
You have to be the lord of yourself, and in
that you should feel so comforted, so happy.

42:47.119 --> 42:57.890
In giving others, you’ll find it very much
easier than taking something from others.

42:57.890 --> 43:07.319
It’s very, very surprising how Sahaja Yoga
has taught you all these things.

43:07.319 --> 43:17.480
In Sahaj Yog people have to say that “They
are very wonderful, they are very beautiful

43:17.480 --> 43:18.480
people.

43:18.480 --> 43:24.800
They are very loving, they are very kind.”

43:24.800 --> 43:36.540
I want to, I want to hear that all the time
about them, about you all, that you all are

43:36.540 --> 43:44.309
individually or collectively, you are something
outstandingly great.

43:44.309 --> 43:58.170
But this greatness is not by domination or
by showing off, but it is coming from within.

43:58.170 --> 44:00.730
People see you and know it is something.

44:00.730 --> 44:03.450
And that is how Sahaja Yoga is going to spread.

44:03.450 --> 44:11.259
It is the Christ within you has to arise,
Christ within you has to guide.

44:11.259 --> 44:21.140
It is Christ within you who will teach how
to behave towards others, and how to gain

44:21.140 --> 44:29.040
their confidence and give them the love and
peace that you have now flowing within you,

44:29.040 --> 44:35.079
to make them very, very happy and joyous people.

44:35.079 --> 44:38.010
This is the message of resurrection.

44:38.010 --> 44:42.849
This is the message of breaking the Sahasrara.

44:42.849 --> 44:52.569
So this egg which was described in the - very
surprising, very clearly described in "Devi

44:52.569 --> 44:59.470
Mahatmayam," how this egg was formed and was
broken into two, and from one part of the

44:59.470 --> 45:02.380
egg came out Christ.

45:02.380 --> 45:06.019
Another part was Shri Ganesha.

45:06.019 --> 45:15.910
It’s all written down, but this Christ is
described as Mahavishnu, not as Christ, so

45:15.910 --> 45:24.410
this Mahavishnu then rose and He does all
these, all wonderful things.

45:24.410 --> 45:37.190
It’s a real message beautifully written
by the life of Christ, that now as we are

45:37.190 --> 45:48.499
thoughtlessly aware now, we have to express
that light through our lives, and we have

45:48.499 --> 45:59.880
to show to the world that we are quite capable,
and that only we are within ourselves absolutely

45:59.880 --> 46:00.880
complete.

46:00.880 --> 46:03.839
We don’t want anything from others.

46:03.839 --> 46:09.289
What we want now, to give whatever we have
achieved to others.

46:09.289 --> 46:17.910
This is what people are looking at you, and
at all the Sahaja Yogis.

46:17.910 --> 46:24.829
May God bless you.

46:24.829 --> 46:39.970
Thinking of Christ, I find it impossible to
keep awake even because, to keep in these

46:39.970 --> 46:51.920
modern times, it's very difficult when you
are thinking of Christ and talking about Him.

46:51.920 --> 47:03.109
It just, something shows that how people never
understood such a great man, such a great

47:03.109 --> 47:04.109
personality.

47:04.109 --> 47:07.990
And He was Divine, absolutely Divine; despite
that He made a drama, we should say, to go

47:07.990 --> 47:10.319
through all the sufferings.

47:10.319 --> 47:24.109
It's very painful, even to remember all that:
how He crucified Himself and how He died.

47:24.109 --> 47:34.619
But the main point is this: He's done for
you, for all of you, and you are so indebted

47:34.619 --> 47:35.619
to Him.

47:35.619 --> 47:47.220
It is His work which has helped the Kundalini
to be awakened and could pass through this

47:47.220 --> 47:49.589
fontanelle bone area.

47:49.589 --> 47:55.850
All this would have been impossible without
the sacrifice of Christ.

47:55.850 --> 48:05.869
You all should thus deserve to have some sacrifices.

48:05.869 --> 48:11.960
See, this is a very symbolic thing that has
happened.

48:11.960 --> 48:23.040
And you all should be all the time prepared
to sacrifice whatever is possible, for the

48:23.040 --> 48:25.640
emancipation of humanity.

48:25.640 --> 48:30.680
It's very, very subtle at this moment now.

48:30.680 --> 48:34.990
Forget about your seeking, forget about everything.

48:34.990 --> 49:06.279
What is needed is that you have to remember
all the time that you are saved, you are being

49:06.279 --> 49:22.220
blessed, by the sacrifices of Christ.

49:22.220 --> 49:30.190
It's very important.

49:30.190 --> 49:43.479
May God bless you all.
