00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.390
Easter Puja
Istanbul, Turkey

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.610
April 19, 1998

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.540
Today we are celebrating the resurrection
of Christ.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:32.220
That is the greatest message of Christ's life,
not the crucifixion.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:49.080
Anybody can be crucified and killed, but this
dead body of Christ was resurrected from death.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:56.840
Death itself died, and He overcome it.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:13.020
It's a miracle for ordinary human beings,
definitely, but not for Christ, because He

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.070
was a Divine person.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:24.130
He was Shri Ganesha, He was Omkara Itself.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:34.670
So He could walk on the water, gravity would
not affect Him.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:43.460
And also He got resurrected because death
could not affect Him.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:56.400
Such a great Divine personality, specially
created for human beings, that people should

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.610
recognize Him.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.740
But they did not recognize Him.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:08.420
They killed Him in a very brutal manner.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:19.930
And even now they think cross is a great thing
because Christ died on the cross.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:28.310
It's a very cruel idea of human beings to
respect the cross.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.049
What does it show?

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:48.500
It shows that people liked all the cruelties
done to Him, symbolizing cross as the one

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:58.639
that represented His death and His atrocities,
the way He was tortured.

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:08.440
So it was a very sad time when He was crucified.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:19.760
But when He got resurrected, it was the most
joyous, most auspicious and most beautiful

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.760
time.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:33.270
The resurrection of Christ is very symbolic
for Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:45.680
If Christ could be resurrected, then human
beings also can be resurrected, because He

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:54.840
came as a human being with all powers, and
He created the path of resurrection for us.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:03.460
This path of resurrection is the one that
we have followed in Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:13.150
But the greatest thing is the piercing of
the Agnya Chakra which is described in all

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:27.610
spiritual treatise, or may be called as the
scriptures, that that is the door which is

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:38.080
golden, which is like a cover, and no one
can pass through that, so constricted is this

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.169
door of Agnya Chakra.

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:45.720
But Christ did cross that.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:57.110
His crossing has helped us today to
open your Agnya.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.889
Without opening the Agnya you cannot go to
Sahasrara.

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:12.620
And this was done so easily in your case,
only because Christ could go through all that

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:19.010
torture and all that brutality, and crossed
over.

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:29.539
How much we should be indebted to Him, I don't
know words that can express, because He is

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:36.139
the One who took lead in telling people that
“You seek.

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:39.240
You seek and you'll find.”

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:48.509
And then He says that “You have to come
and bang at the door.”

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:56.930
This is exactly what has happened in your
case, that you have risen up to Agnya and

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.580
then you have crossed beyond Agnya.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:11.370
This crossing of Agnya was not at all difficult
for you, though by your own ideas of thinking

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:18.949
and of conditioning, of the futuristic planning
and all that, it was a big, big crowd, I should

00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:26.669
say, of very black clouds were hovering on
the Agnya.

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:35.819
Your thoughts were overpowering you, and you
could not have penetrated through this Agnya

00:07:35.819 --> 00:07:38.229
which was all covered.

00:07:38.229 --> 00:07:44.990
But you did, and you never even felt that
you have crossed the Agnya Chakra so easily.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:53.939
The first of all, we all should really be
very thankful to Christ for opening the Agnya

00:07:53.939 --> 00:07:55.280
for you.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:05.639
For Him all the tortures and all the brutality
were nothing, because His purpose of life,

00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:14.060
His purpose of His advent, His incarnation,
was to break the Agnya Chakra.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:22.159
Today you will find that even though your
Agnya is opened out and you have crossed through,

00:08:22.159 --> 00:08:33.979
still you'll be amazed that people get involved
in the Agnya Chakra.

00:08:33.979 --> 00:08:39.090
In Sahaja Yoga people do get involved in Agnya
Chakra.

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:46.080
Now how do we see through introspection what
happens to us?

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:58.970
For example, once people come to Sahaja Yoga,
they think they are in charge: in charge of

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:08.690
this, in charge of that, in charge of all
the Sahaja Yogis; and they start behaving

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:14.570
in a manner which doesn't behove a Sahaja
Yogi.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:16.310
It doesn't.

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:24.530
I've seen them, and I really am amused the
way they just start thrusting themselves and

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:30.300
showing off that they are very much in charge.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.090
This is nothing modern.

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:38.430
This is used to be there with human beings.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:46.089
But if it was so, it was before Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:46.089 --> 00:09:55.130
Even now people get into the mood of dominating
others by saying that “We are in charge.”

00:09:55.130 --> 00:10:02.710
Sahaja Yoga is not so simple as you think,
because there are lots of temptations.

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:05.190
Supposing you make somebody a leader.

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:17.570
Now a leader becomes sort of “in charge,”
you know, and he gets the drunkenness of power.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:29.730
When he's like that he starts dominating all
the rest of the people, and also starts showing

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:43.600
off that he's something very great and he
has to dominate all the rest of the people.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.680
Then he creates an atmosphere of fear.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:52.360
Firstly, I've seen what happens with them
is that they start saying falsely that “Mother

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:58.000
has told this, Mother has said so, this is
Mother's ideas.”

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.320
I have nothing to do with that gentleman,
but he goes on talking like that, and people

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.889
get very frightened.

00:11:03.889 --> 00:11:10.390
Then also he can also frighten you by saying,
“I will tell Mother.

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:15.519
Mother will listen to me and She'll punish
you.”

00:11:15.519 --> 00:11:22.730
I am sometimes very surprised at such people,
because I have never said that I'll punish

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:29.589
somebody or I'll take him out of Sahaja Yoga
- nothing of the kind.

00:11:29.589 --> 00:11:34.209
So this man who thinks no end of himself,
he may be a leader, may not be a leader, may

00:11:34.209 --> 00:11:43.779
be nothing in Sahaja Yoga; and then if he
starts talking like this in such a funny manner

00:11:43.779 --> 00:11:48.430
that it doesn't look that the person is a
Sahaja Yogi.

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:55.120
Then he goes even further.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:05.709
He goes himself describing as something very
great, as if he's the one who is chosen specially

00:12:05.709 --> 00:12:08.630
for rising higher and higher.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:12.589
When I hear about these things I'm really
amazed.

00:12:12.589 --> 00:12:23.399
How can people befool themselves all the time,
and behave in such a manner?

00:12:23.399 --> 00:12:26.920
First thing in Sahaja Yoga is humility.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:31.172
If you are not a humble person, you cannot
be a Sahaja Yogi.

00:12:31.172 --> 00:12:40.961
The person who orders about, the person who
talks in a manner as if he is Hitler, any

00:12:40.961 --> 00:12:51.421
person who tries to control and be in charge
of the thing, all these capacities only show

00:12:51.421 --> 00:12:57.269
that that person has achieved nothing in Sahaja
Yoga.

00:12:57.269 --> 00:13:01.560
First thing is to enjoy the humility.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:07.259
I've seen people like this, they'll always
sit in the first row.

00:13:07.259 --> 00:13:11.120
They'll be always sitting in a place where
you just see them all the time there.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.860
I just smile.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:16.330
I know they are just show-offs.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:20.889
They think no end of themselves, and that's
why they are there.

00:13:20.889 --> 00:13:26.870
But they themselves are losing, they themselves
are not very happy.

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:33.680
That's why they try to do all these tricks
and this kind of domination.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:48.720
The other side of it is people who are humble,
who are simple, who are honest and who are

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:54.160
really seeking the truth, are being oppressed
by this gentleman.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:14:02.790
He oppresses them, tries to show off, tries
to make slaves out of others.

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:14.170
I have seen people have gone so far that there
was a group of people who just would not move

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:19.399
even an inch without the permission of their
leader.

00:14:19.399 --> 00:14:27.540
And they would go all out to be subservient
to such a irrational personality.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:34.709
First of all, you know this is the love of
Mother.

00:14:34.709 --> 00:14:37.350
Mother never dominates.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:41.920
She cannot dominate, because She is nothing
but love.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:48.630
As soon as She sees the problem, immediately
She absorbs it.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:56.990
She has to make deliberations, just a drama
sometimes to show that She's angry.

00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:00.790
But She cannot basically be angry with anyone.

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:08.010
It's the love which all the time, all the
time is flowing.

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:12.150
And that love envelops the Mother, as well
as envelops you.

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:17.029
That is how you people will understand Sahaja
Yoga.

00:15:17.029 --> 00:15:22.029
What does a human being need is nothing but
love and compassion, love and compassion of

00:15:22.029 --> 00:15:27.490
a very, very pure type.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:32.720
Look at Christ.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.660
He pitied the people who crucified Him.

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:43.610
He told His Father, the God Almighty, that
“Please forgive them, because they do not

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.910
know what they are doing.”

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:53.290
He could see that the blindness of these people
are doing wrong things, and God the Father

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:58.020
will be very annoyed, Who is wrathful and
may destroy them.

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:11.560
So this is what it was done with a very compassionate
feeling, without thinking about, just automatically

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:20.810
He felt that these people are doing all this
to Me, and I don't know what will happen to

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:22.250
them.

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:24.769
So He prayed to God, to Father, “Please
forgive.

00:16:24.769 --> 00:16:27.949
Please forgive them, for they do not know
what they are doing.

00:16:27.949 --> 00:16:31.570
They are blind, so please do not punish them.”

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:32.620
What compassion!

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:33.660
What love!

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:40.759
I mean, think of it: do we do that in our
life?

00:16:40.759 --> 00:16:49.529
If somebody harms us, troubles us, do we ask
Father to forgive those who do not know what

00:16:49.529 --> 00:16:50.529
they are doing?

00:16:50.529 --> 00:16:56.970
That should be the level of Sahaja Yoga, and
it will work out very well.

00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:04.240
If you ask for forgiveness, God will look
after them, He’ll transform them, He'll

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.959
bring them to their senses.

00:17:07.959 --> 00:17:19.130
The message of Christ are full of love, compassion,
pure compassion.

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:27.210
How He tried to protect Mary Magdalene is
an example of that, who was leading a sinful

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:33.690
life; and for a saint it had nothing to do,
He had nothing to do with her.

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:41.540
But when He saw she being stoned by people,
He stood against her, took a stone in His

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:52.500
own hand, and He says, “All right, those
who have not committed any wrong deed or have

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:58.330
not committed any sin, can take this stone
and hit Me.”

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:05.510
And nobody came forward, because they had
to face themselves.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:18.590
When we are dominating others, then a kind
of a cruel joy is there, some sort of a joy

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:23.670
that I don't understand Myself, but people
have.

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:32.200
They show off that we have achieved this joy,
we have achieved this great power.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:42.740
It has happened for centuries, with all the
great emperors and also despotic rulers.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:47.720
But with Sahaja Yogis it should be the other
way round.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:55.820
They have to rule the world with peace and
love.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:59.360
They don't have to show off, by any chance.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:03.360
This is how Sahaja Yoga will spread much,
much fast.

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:09.500
What does the world need? - you just think
of it.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.180
It needs only love and affection.

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:24.580
Those people who are yet lost in the ignorance
about life and are still busy troubling others,

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:33.260
torturing others, going against the collectivity,
will have to return to normalcy.

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:39.220
It’s very abnormal behavior sometimes, and
you just don’t understand why they behave

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.220
like mad people.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:51.770
It is very difficult also to tell such a person
that “You are mad.”

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:59.650
And also it’s difficult to be with such
a person who is so mad with some sort of a

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:00.900
power.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:06.190
It goes on like that with so many Sahaja Yogis,
I have seen, who start thinking they have

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:15.370
lots of powers, they can do whatever they
like, they can talk to anyone and they can

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:16.870
confuse everyone.

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:26.700
But in Sahaja Yoga you don’t have to confuse,
you have to clearly express your love.

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:34.130
But that doesn’t mean any kind of a particular
gesture or a particular happening, but it

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:41.660
is just a inner oneness with each other.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:56.400
Is, sometimes I find Sahaja Yogis so much
understanding each other, so much loving each

00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:04.010
other, so beautifully enjoying the love of
other people.

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:11.530
When I see that I feel very, very happy, absolutely
overjoyed.

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:20.920
That’s what I wanted: these people should
enjoy, is there.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:28.810
And you’ll be amazed, the most enjoyable
thing is the love that you give to others.

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:36.120
You may not receive, but when you give love
to others, then it’s the most enjoyable

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.120
thing.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:49.220
But the way you express yourself is also an
art, I think, to understand how to please

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:52.150
others, how to make them happy.

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:57.980
I've told this story before also, about a
saint who lived in Gaganbhoura, is a, what

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:04.420
you can say is a hill or a mountain.

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:13.950
He used to live there and he couldn't walk,
you see: because of vibrations he lost his

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:18.990
legs or something, the power in them.

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:27.750
And then he would go all over the place on
a tiger, because tiger loved him and he loved

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:29.590
the tiger.

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:37.680
So this gentleman was all the time telling
people from Bombay, “What are you doing

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.680
here?

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:39.680
Mother has come!

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.470
Go and touch Her Feet.”

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:47.560
I didn't know why he was so much concerned.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.910
So I told Sahaja Yogis, “I must go and meet
him.”

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:58.050
So all these gurus, you see, they say that
“We don't leave our pillows.

00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:04.400
We have to be in our own pillow” - means
wherever they live, they exist, they won't

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.400
go out.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.590
I'm the other way round.

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:12.380
I'm never stationed in one place, you see.

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:15.340
So they asked if I could go.

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:17.450
I said, “Why not?”

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:22.280
So I went there, and the Sahaja Yogis said
that “Mother, You never go anywhere, so

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.600
why do You want to go here?”

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:34.200
I said, “All right, see the vibrations,”
and it’s tremendous vibrations.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:39.450
So when I went up, this fellow was very angry
with the rain because he was supposed to control

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:43.440
the rain, he was supposed to be controlling
the rain.

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:54.290
It's very surprising that when I went up,
he could not control and I got completely

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:55.290
drenched.

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:58.920
So he was very angry.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:05.470
He was sitting on a stone, you know, and he
was going like this with anger.

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:06.650
I didn't say anything to him.

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:17.600
I went inside and sat in the cave, where he
had made some arrangement for Me to be seated.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:25.070
Then he came, he touched My Feet, and he sat
down.

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:33.260
And I was amazed that he was still angry and
he couldn't understand why the rain could

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.260
not stop.

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:40.770
So he asked Me, “Why did You not allow me
to stop that rain?

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:48.590
Because after all You are coming to see me
all the way, and the rain should have behaved.

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:54.500
And I also could not somehow or other control
the rain, so what was the thing, what was

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:55.500
the lesson?”

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.980
I just smiled.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:04.930
I said, “See, you are an ascetic, you are
a sanyasi, and I am your Mother.

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:13.520
I cannot take a sari from you because after
all you are a sanyasi, and you are not supposed

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.540
to take anything from a sanyasi.”

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:22.530
Even the Mother cannot take anything from
him.

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:26.260
“But you have bought a nice sari for Me.

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:31.820
So I had to get drenched so that I could take
a sari from you.”

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:37.120
You see, the sweetness of My telling him just
made him melt down.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.530
He started crying.

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:46.510
He said, “We need a Mother for this world.

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:48.672
There should be the Mother.

00:25:48.672 --> 00:25:56.790
We cannot solve it, because whatever it is,
we get angry or we want to disappear.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:26:08.350
We don't want to be with these horrible people
who are so sinful, to help them.”

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:14.660
This is the problem with the world today,
and that's why you find very few spiritual

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:18.670
people in the whole world.

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:26.900
Because they are the ones who are being very
much tortured, troubled, insulted, all kinds

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:30.900
of things happen.

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:35.630
So they're struggling, struggling, so they
want to die very fast.

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:46.330
Gyaneshwara, such a great personality, such
a great writer, poet, I mean he was everything,

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:49.190
so beautifully he has written.

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:56.350
But at the age of twenty-three he took his
samadhi, means he went into a cave, and closed

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:59.000
the cave and died there.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:07.550
Must have been tired and fed up with the surroundings
of ignorant people, and that's why he did.

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:17.280
So you can imagine a person like Gyaneshwara,
who was the incarnation of Kartikeya, had

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:26.800
to recede into the world of the dead because
he couldn't bear it any more the way they

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.210
were torturing them.

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:38.280
They tortured him so much, saying that he
is the son of a sanyasi and he has, I mean

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:48.280
it's like this: “son of a sanyasi” means
he is no good, he is absolutely like an illegitimate

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:55.690
child; and he is ill-treated to such an extent,
he didn't even have shoes to wear in that

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:56.770
heat of India.

00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:58.560
He used to walk bare feet.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:06.210
And his sister, brother, who were great scholars,
who were great saints, great incarnations,

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:07.790
all of themself.

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:16.910
As a result he wanted just to disappear, and
he made a beautiful way of doing it, that

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:24.620
he told them that “I have to go,” and
he took leave from them and went inside his

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:29.620
cave, and got his samadhi.

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:35.520
Even Christ was very young when He was crucified.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:41.600
He was thirty-three years of age.

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:58.780
It was all planned by the Divine that He was
to be crucified, to make way for our Sahaja

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:10.190
Yoga: to open the Agnya, to sacrifice His
life, and for Him to be hanged in such a horrendous,

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:20.180
cruel way, which normally you do not find
people behaving in such a manner towards a

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:23.040
person who is about to die.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:31.850
So what happened, that those people who were
in charge of His crucifixion must have been

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:35.500
some devils, the way they behaved.

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:43.550
It is not possible to forgive them even if
He, Christ says; it's difficult to forgive

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:49.430
such people who were watching the crucifixion
of Christ.

00:29:49.430 --> 00:30:07.740
So if that is the case that a person like
Him thought that “Let Me do My job, is to

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:11.270
break Sahasrara.”

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:18.710
And then He didn't want to live, live with
these stupid people to be tortured, and He

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:25.890
just disappeared into Kashmir, where He lived
after His resurrection.

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:38.470
Lots of stories are there about His ascent
and His resurrection, and you see, all those

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:45.870
stories if you read, you'll be amazed how
miraculously He got His second birth, you

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:50.980
can say, or second life in Kashmir.

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:58.870
He lived in Kashmir happily for some time
with His Mother, and there He died.

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:08.090
They say there's a grave of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and also His Mother who was there.

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:15.080
But who has taken advantage of His life, from
His life?

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.080
Who are the people really who wanted Him to
die?

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:21.970
You know very well.

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:41.700
You know very well how Christ died, and the
people came up suddenly, like Paul and Peter,

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.300
who tried to make a big business out of it.

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:58.220
It's very sad to see that these two persons
brought such a shame.

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:04.370
This Paul was nothing but an organizer, I
think, also a beginner.

00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:09.270
You see, he was a person who was bureaucratic,
I should say.

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:15.670
But he was not only bureaucratic, he was also
a man who wanted to have a big position.

00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:28.640
So he told a lie that he went down to Damascus,
and on his way, on his way he saw a big cross.

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:38.640
According to Sahaja Yoga all such signs are
a sign of supra-conscious, is not of the Spirit.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:45.610
And then he came back and he started his own
research, and sort of things like that.

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:48.010
And he's written a lot of things.

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:58.360
But throughout if you read, you'll find that
he was not a Sahaja Yogi, he was just an organizer.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:04.890
He was a bureaucratic personality who was
writing how we should administer, how we should

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:13.750
have people who are different types of people,
how should we manage them.

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:15.990
So he's management department.

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:19.660
He was the management department for the Christians.

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:29.380
So the Christians also became extremely, very
secretariat type: like you see, everything

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:37.040
has a time, you must come like this, you must
sit like this, must talk like this.

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:44.420
And also the nations which are supposed to
be Christians are observing all that in a

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:46.280
very official manner.

00:33:46.280 --> 00:34:02.710
It is not understood why, why are they so
much official in everything?

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:11.280
Just the opposite what Christ did, is to break
the Agnya, they built up this.

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:18.800
And the Christian nations became the most
arrogant, most aggressive nations in the whole

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:19.800
world.

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:25.600
For them, it was their right to occupy any
land they saw.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:36.409
It was in their right to establish their own
laws, their own, I should say, assemblies.

00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:39.770
All this is done in India, I know.

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:50.280
Even today if you go to places like Punjab
and all that, you'll find the people are just

00:34:50.280 --> 00:35:04.770
living like rustic people working very hard,
and they are all the time under attack from

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:17.440
people who are dominating, and those who wanted
the full advantage to be taken out of these

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.339
people.

00:35:20.339 --> 00:35:28.569
It was a ridiculous thing to behave like that
as Christians.

00:35:28.569 --> 00:35:32.609
Then also they started converting people.

00:35:32.609 --> 00:35:36.690
It's another nonsense, converting.

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:41.630
Converting them in the south, in the...

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:48.089
What they did is to - we Indians never make
breads; they don't know how to use an oven

00:35:48.089 --> 00:35:49.269
in the south.

00:35:49.269 --> 00:35:56.810
So they made huge, big cakes - you can call
it a cake or you can call it a bread - and

00:35:56.810 --> 00:36:06.819
put it in the water or in a well, and they
would say that we have put the part of the

00:36:06.819 --> 00:36:15.079
calf of a buffalo or could be a cow, or something
like that.

00:36:15.079 --> 00:36:18.260
And they just believed them.

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:24.619
And so they said, “Now you are finished,
because you're no more belonging to Hindu

00:36:24.619 --> 00:36:27.469
religion or to any other religion.

00:36:27.469 --> 00:36:29.839
So now you have become Christian.”

00:36:29.839 --> 00:36:38.310
And that's how they made thousands and thousands
of people Christians who were actually downtrodden

00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:43.349
people, I should say - at least, they would
call themselves downtrodden.

00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:52.990
Now all these downtrodden people, they wanted
to have converted to Christianity, because

00:36:52.990 --> 00:37:07.940
they thought - you see, it is, they all wanted
all such people who would just follow the

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:14.299
missionaries, and who would not question.

00:37:14.299 --> 00:37:22.299
Because they were not educated people, they're
not people of any understanding or intelligence

00:37:22.299 --> 00:37:25.140
to understand what these people are.

00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:33.000
So when they started this tirade against the
downtrodden people, so many of them joined.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:44.589
Thus they formed their own race and they started
their religion there.

00:37:44.589 --> 00:37:51.309
This is a thing one should understand, how
the dominating nature of people accepted a

00:37:51.309 --> 00:38:00.299
particular religion, because that religion
is nothing but humility.

00:38:00.299 --> 00:38:10.319
And how then these people supposed to be in
charge of Christianity, converted people into

00:38:10.319 --> 00:38:12.730
something absurd.

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:24.230
You see it is a human nature, it can enjoy
any nonsense, any kind of cruelty, any kind

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:25.529
of oppression.

00:38:25.529 --> 00:38:34.480
It can never give up that realm, that area
where they have been dominating.

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:44.750
Now as it is, the Christian nations have gone
even beyond that, because among the Christians

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:48.270
it is all the freedom given to them.

00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:49.450
They're liberated.

00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:55.349
Do whatever you may like, if you will become
Christian.

00:38:55.349 --> 00:38:58.300
They're all right, isn’t it?

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:06.359
They are the ones who have been dominating,
and those who are dominated are there everywhere.

00:39:06.359 --> 00:39:16.589
They would go to people, ordinary people whom
you can call as aboriginals, and convert them.

00:39:16.589 --> 00:39:18.880
Theirs main method was to convert.

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:23.130
What was the need to convert so many people?

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:29.410
Because in democracy it is important that
the number you have should be large.

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:38.049
So to gain the number, they used to convert.

00:39:38.049 --> 00:39:44.279
And they have ruined so many people.

00:39:44.279 --> 00:39:55.119
It’s really, the whole situation of Christ
really makes Me feel very nervous.

00:39:55.119 --> 00:39:58.799
Today you all are Sahaja Yogis.

00:39:58.799 --> 00:40:05.309
You are all so much higher than others.

00:40:05.309 --> 00:40:11.200
You have all the powers.

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:19.200
And then supposing you want to behave like
the Christians, I don't know what you will

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.200
do.

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:29.130
So now you are on the verge where Sahaja Yoga
is accepted in different countries, and there

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:36.759
people respect people who are Sahaja Yogis,
they have given positions.

00:40:36.759 --> 00:40:44.779
Then suddenly you might get this power business
into your head and you may try, you may try

00:40:44.779 --> 00:40:54.410
to become like a despot, because that is human
nature.

00:40:54.410 --> 00:41:00.400
That's not divine, but that's a human nature.

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:14.450
For example, when in the kingdom of, we can
say of the animals, they are aggressive on

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:19.690
each other, it's all right, it's permitted,
it is done.

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:25.220
But there's a system, there's a way, there's
a method how they dominate.

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:28.460
It's not like this: they jump on everyone.

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:34.520
But I've seen in Sahaja Yoga many people,
you make them a leader - finished.

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.799
Then he sits on everybody's head.

00:41:37.799 --> 00:41:42.210
If you don't make them a leader then they
go on writing letters to Me, one after another,

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:45.430
that “Mother, we want to be leader.

00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:47.800
I want to be a leader.”

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:50.910
Like this they go on insisting on this.

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:55.400
For what do you want to be the leader?

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:57.800
Just to dominate others.

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:03.089
And this domination business is not meant
for Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:03.089 --> 00:42:16.099
I am here today to tell you about, about a
beautiful image of Christ, who rose above

00:42:16.099 --> 00:42:17.240
death.

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:34.549
In the same way let the death of all nonsensical
ideas, all negative thoughts, everything has

00:42:34.549 --> 00:42:38.160
to be overcome.

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:47.119
You have to be the lord of yourself, and in
that you should feel so comforted, so happy.

00:42:47.119 --> 00:42:57.890
In giving others, you’ll find it very much
easier than taking something from others.

00:42:57.890 --> 00:43:07.319
It’s very, very surprising how Sahaja Yoga
has taught you all these things.

00:43:07.319 --> 00:43:17.480
In Sahaj Yog people have to say that “They
are very wonderful, they are very beautiful

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:18.480
people.

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:24.800
They are very loving, they are very kind.”

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:36.540
I want to, I want to hear that all the time
about them, about you all, that you all are

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:44.309
individually or collectively, you are something
outstandingly great.

00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:58.170
But this greatness is not by domination or
by showing off, but it is coming from within.

00:43:58.170 --> 00:44:00.730
People see you and know it is something.

00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:03.450
And that is how Sahaja Yoga is going to spread.

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:11.259
It is the Christ within you has to arise,
Christ within you has to guide.

00:44:11.259 --> 00:44:21.140
It is Christ within you who will teach how
to behave towards others, and how to gain

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:29.040
their confidence and give them the love and
peace that you have now flowing within you,

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:35.079
to make them very, very happy and joyous people.

00:44:35.079 --> 00:44:38.010
This is the message of resurrection.

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:42.849
This is the message of breaking the Sahasrara.

00:44:42.849 --> 00:44:52.569
So this egg which was described in the - very
surprising, very clearly described in "Devi

00:44:52.569 --> 00:44:59.470
Mahatmayam," how this egg was formed and was
broken into two, and from one part of the

00:44:59.470 --> 00:45:02.380
egg came out Christ.

00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:06.019
Another part was Shri Ganesha.

00:45:06.019 --> 00:45:15.910
It’s all written down, but this Christ is
described as Mahavishnu, not as Christ, so

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:24.410
this Mahavishnu then rose and He does all
these, all wonderful things.

00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:37.190
It’s a real message beautifully written
by the life of Christ, that now as we are

00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:48.499
thoughtlessly aware now, we have to express
that light through our lives, and we have

00:45:48.499 --> 00:45:59.880
to show to the world that we are quite capable,
and that only we are within ourselves absolutely

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:00.880
complete.

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:03.839
We don’t want anything from others.

00:46:03.839 --> 00:46:09.289
What we want now, to give whatever we have
achieved to others.

00:46:09.289 --> 00:46:17.910
This is what people are looking at you, and
at all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:24.829
May God bless you.

00:46:24.829 --> 00:46:39.970
Thinking of Christ, I find it impossible to
keep awake even because, to keep in these

00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:51.920
modern times, it's very difficult when you
are thinking of Christ and talking about Him.

00:46:51.920 --> 00:47:03.109
It just, something shows that how people never
understood such a great man, such a great

00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:04.109
personality.

00:47:04.109 --> 00:47:07.990
And He was Divine, absolutely Divine; despite
that He made a drama, we should say, to go

00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:10.319
through all the sufferings.

00:47:10.319 --> 00:47:24.109
It's very painful, even to remember all that:
how He crucified Himself and how He died.

00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:34.619
But the main point is this: He's done for
you, for all of you, and you are so indebted

00:47:34.619 --> 00:47:35.619
to Him.

00:47:35.619 --> 00:47:47.220
It is His work which has helped the Kundalini
to be awakened and could pass through this

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:49.589
fontanelle bone area.

00:47:49.589 --> 00:47:55.850
All this would have been impossible without
the sacrifice of Christ.

00:47:55.850 --> 00:48:05.869
You all should thus deserve to have some sacrifices.

00:48:05.869 --> 00:48:11.960
See, this is a very symbolic thing that has
happened.

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:23.040
And you all should be all the time prepared
to sacrifice whatever is possible, for the

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:25.640
emancipation of humanity.

00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:30.680
It's very, very subtle at this moment now.

00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:34.990
Forget about your seeking, forget about everything.

00:48:34.990 --> 00:49:06.279
What is needed is that you have to remember
all the time that you are saved, you are being

00:49:06.279 --> 00:49:22.220
blessed, by the sacrifices of Christ.

00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:30.190
It's very important.

00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:43.479
May God bless you all.
