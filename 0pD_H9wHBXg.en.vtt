00:00:00.585 --> 00:00:05.492
All right. Put your hands towards Me.

00:00:11.264 --> 00:00:14.321
First of all, I must say

00:00:14.522 --> 00:00:21.644
I am very happy to see so many Sahaja
Yogis in Hong Kong.

00:00:24.654 --> 00:00:29.170
Hong Kong is a very materialistic place,
as you know,

00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:32.950
and people are too busy,

00:00:34.016 --> 00:00:38.036
but the problems come out of that busyness.

00:00:38.237 --> 00:00:42.151
All this busy life creates lots
of problems.

00:00:42.352 --> 00:00:50.374
So I am sure there will be more coming
from the last program, definitely,

00:00:53.184 --> 00:00:58.296
lots of them, and your hands will be full.

00:00:58.875 --> 00:01:02.450
So I just wanted to tell you

00:01:02.651 --> 00:01:10.832
what should we really do to achieve
the maximum results.

00:01:11.055 --> 00:01:17.244
First of all, we have to establish

00:01:17.445 --> 00:01:23.944
that we are Sahaja Yogis, we are very
sober people

00:01:25.134 --> 00:01:33.499
and we have among ourselves tremendous
respect and love.

00:01:33.922 --> 00:01:37.086
So one should never support

00:01:37.287 --> 00:01:43.163
an outsider who is not yet a Sahaja Yogi
or who will be a Sahaja Yogi

00:01:43.364 --> 00:01:47.250
but support each other, all the time.

00:01:47.451 --> 00:01:51.997
Do not argue among yourselves.

00:01:52.198 --> 00:01:57.295
Maybe one person may be wrong, I am
not saying.

00:01:57.496 --> 00:02:04.285
But [it] is important that we should
support each other,

00:02:04.486 --> 00:02:08.481
and above all, we must support the leader.

00:02:08.682 --> 00:02:12.986
Whatever the leader says, we must listen
to him.

00:02:13.187 --> 00:02:21.134
It’s very important, in Sahaja Yoga we are
a collective organisation,

00:02:21.335 --> 00:02:25.420
that too a living organisation.

00:02:25.621 --> 00:02:31.137
If somebody is not collective, he is thrown
out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:31.338 --> 00:02:33.977
We are not very happy with such people.

00:02:34.178 --> 00:02:38.187
So you must try to put

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:56.078
all effort to see that you are all
collectively one

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:59.685
and say the same thing.

00:02:59.926 --> 00:03:05.867
This is very important to know.

00:03:06.334 --> 00:03:12.502
Also there are people who may not be
so good among you

00:03:12.703 --> 00:03:17.353
who can judge the vibrations, possibly.

00:03:17.554 --> 00:03:21.996
If so, you should ask your leader.

00:03:22.197 --> 00:03:25.651
But among yourselves you should never
argue, because we know

00:03:25.852 --> 00:03:30.165
that Sahaja Yoga gives you absolute truth.

00:03:30.366 --> 00:03:32.980
So others should not doubt

00:03:33.181 --> 00:03:39.710
by your behaviour that these people don’t
know anything. All right?

00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:46.753
Then second thing of Sahaja Yoga is that
it is the power of love,

00:03:46.954 --> 00:03:50.395
it’s of compassion, of divine love.

00:03:50.596 --> 00:03:54.204
Must understand what is divine love is.

00:03:54.405 --> 00:03:59.045
That is the love that is the, like the sap,
as I always say,

00:03:59.246 --> 00:04:08.339
that runs in the tree. It gives nourishment
to the roots,

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:19.386
then to all parts of the tree, and then
it evaporates or it goes down.

00:04:19.586 --> 00:04:27.534
Supposing it gets stuck into one flower,
what will happen

00:04:27.735 --> 00:04:32.710
that the tree will die, and ultimately
the flower will also die.

00:04:32.911 --> 00:04:38.422
So our love is not limited love.

00:04:38.623 --> 00:04:42.752
Like, we love our children, all right,
[we] love other children also.

00:04:42.953 --> 00:04:52.180
Everybody is absolutely in full pure love
with each other.

00:04:52.381 --> 00:05:00.808
Now, one must understand the pure love,
that it is not attached to anyone,

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:05.011
but at the same time, it is pure love.

00:05:05.212 --> 00:05:14.651
If you don’t have pure love in your heart
because the culture is different,

00:05:14.866 --> 00:05:26.805
people start moving their attention and
spoiling their attention.

00:05:27.281 --> 00:05:30.967
So, so many people asked Me: “Mother,
what to do?”

00:05:31.168 --> 00:05:35.329
I said: “Keep your eyes only up to three
feet,

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.600
so you will see beautiful things, like you
will see flowers,

00:05:39.801 --> 00:05:45.098
you will see children, and nothing
horrible”.

00:05:45.299 --> 00:05:53.019
So, whatever makes your attention
disturbed, try to avoid.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.644
Best is to concentrate on your meditation.

00:05:59.203 --> 00:06:06.146
For meditation in the morning you can
just put

00:06:06.347 --> 00:06:10.960
your right hand towards the photograph

00:06:13.525 --> 00:06:17.474
and the left hand up there.

00:06:17.755 --> 00:06:23.997
Then put your left hand towards
the photograph… - like this.

00:06:24.363 --> 00:06:30.098
Then left hand towards the photograph
and right hand on the Mother Earth.

00:06:30.299 --> 00:06:36.184
[It] is better to sit on the ground,
in the morning.

00:06:36.739 --> 00:06:43.470
Then, if thoughtless awareness is
established

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:48.181
by looking at the photograph, close your
eyes.

00:06:48.451 --> 00:06:53.384
Now, some people say: “Mother, my heart
is not open”. All right.

00:06:53.585 --> 00:06:58.222
So you can say, looking at the Mother:

00:06:58.423 --> 00:07:04.355
“Mother, please, come in my heart.”

00:07:04.556 --> 00:07:07.822
Somebody’s Sahasrara is not open.

00:07:08.022 --> 00:07:12.162
Then you have to say: “Mother, please
come in my head”.

00:07:12.363 --> 00:07:15.132
With both the hands.

00:07:15.333 --> 00:07:22.102
Whatever portion you think in the body
is not doing well,

00:07:22.303 --> 00:07:28.001
I am always available, so you can ask.

00:07:30.105 --> 00:07:33.332
Your meditation should be good, first
and foremost.

00:07:33.533 --> 00:07:39.364
If you are good Sahaja Yogis, then only
others will believe you.

00:07:39.564 --> 00:07:44.826
But if you are not good Sahaja Yogis,
nobody will believe you.

00:07:45.027 --> 00:07:49.268
For so many people I have seen I am
something beyond them.

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:53.941
But Sahaja Yogis are the ones which really
make them feel

00:07:54.142 --> 00:07:58.237
that “these are extraordinary people”.

00:08:00.946 --> 00:08:07.088
Then, after that, dealing with them
as I said,

00:08:07.289 --> 00:08:14.315
has to be absolutely with pure attention.

00:08:14.516 --> 00:08:17.830
To begin with, the men should deal only
with men

00:08:18.031 --> 00:08:22.287
and the women should deal only with women

00:08:22.488 --> 00:08:25.519
and no complications should come out.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.889
Because that is the biggest blemish Sahaja
Yoga can have,

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:34.377
that they are just like ordinary people.

00:08:38.189 --> 00:08:42.632
So, you have to be careful about yourself.

00:08:42.833 --> 00:08:47.512
Before sleeping, if you have time, you must
do footsoaking.

00:08:47.713 --> 00:08:50.777
If one day you do not do it, don’t torture
yourself for that,

00:08:50.978 --> 00:08:55.004
but it’s better that you do footsoaking.

00:08:55.205 --> 00:09:00.040
And in footsoaking first of all you
must know

00:09:00.241 --> 00:09:04.410
what sort of a personality you have.

00:09:04.642 --> 00:09:07.985
Mostly you are right-sided, mostly.

00:09:08.186 --> 00:09:11.045
So put [your] right hand towards
the photograph,

00:09:11.246 --> 00:09:17.320
both the feet in the water with little salt
and left hand like that.

00:09:17.521 --> 00:09:20.982
But some are left-sided, some are
definitely very much.

00:09:21.183 --> 00:09:24.185
They should not touch water.

00:09:24.386 --> 00:09:30.565
Two types of treatments are there.

00:09:30.766 --> 00:09:35.707
Especially left-sided people should
not soak,

00:09:35.908 --> 00:09:41.203
should not use ice. This is all right-sided
treatment.

00:09:41.404 --> 00:09:46.756
After doing your right-sided or left-sided
treatment,

00:09:46.957 --> 00:09:53.209
I would say you put both your hands towards
the photograph

00:09:53.766 --> 00:09:58.437
and see for yourself how it is working out,

00:10:00.349 --> 00:10:04.504
without water, without candle.

00:10:04.816 --> 00:10:08.525
But I would again say that right-sided
people should not

00:10:08.726 --> 00:10:12.673
use candle as far as possible.

00:10:15.067 --> 00:10:20.232
This electricity is all right, you can
use it.

00:10:20.433 --> 00:10:23.186
They should not sit in the sun, they should
put

00:10:23.387 --> 00:10:27.183
ice on their liver; also they can put ice
here

00:10:27.384 --> 00:10:30.574
when it is very hot, it’s very good to put
ice here.

00:10:30.775 --> 00:10:35.308
Also for diabetes you can put the ice here.

00:10:36.885 --> 00:10:40.233
In Sahaja Yoga the treatment is very
simple:

00:10:40.434 --> 00:10:45.096
for right-sided people very simple, and
for left-sided.

00:10:45.297 --> 00:10:49.514
Right-sided people get problems like liver,

00:10:49.715 --> 00:10:56.060
diabetes, blood cancer,

00:10:57.418 --> 00:11:01.270
kidney coagulation,

00:11:01.471 --> 00:11:06.986
that means they can’t pass urine,
constipation,

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:14.174
also asthma, heart attack – massive,

00:11:14.375 --> 00:11:23.655
and also paralysis, on the right side;
so many.

00:11:23.856 --> 00:11:31.043
Now, the left-sided people get pain
all over left side;

00:11:31.244 --> 00:11:38.156
also can get all kinds of psychosomatic
diseases which are not curable,

00:11:38.357 --> 00:11:47.258
like cancer, myelitis, Parkinson’s,
all kinds.

00:11:48.735 --> 00:11:51.318
But if you do your meditation every day,

00:11:51.519 --> 00:11:54.235
once in a while you may miss it, it doesn’t
matter,

00:11:54.435 --> 00:11:59.335
you will immediately feel that you are
completely cured

00:11:59.536 --> 00:12:03.296
and you keep good health.

00:12:03.497 --> 00:12:07.072
That’s the only way you can grow.

00:12:07.273 --> 00:12:15.585
And try to bring the point where you are
thoughtlessly aware.

00:12:15.786 --> 00:12:23.391
The best way to be thoughtless is to say
the mantra of Nirvichara.

00:12:24.007 --> 00:12:27.978
That’s very important. And secondly,

00:12:28.179 --> 00:12:30.770
to go on for forgiving: “I forgive
everyone, I forgive everyone”

00:12:30.971 --> 00:12:38.615
so the thoughts will stop. That is the time
when you are in the present.

00:12:38.816 --> 00:12:44.969
That is the time really you will grow
in spirituality.

00:12:46.528 --> 00:12:51.341
We have people in India and abroad

00:12:51.542 --> 00:12:55.052
who have become such powerful Sahaja Yogis

00:12:55.253 --> 00:12:59.668
that just by prayer they can achieve
lot of things.

00:12:59.869 --> 00:13:05.403
We are not here to destroy anyone
or to torture anyone:

00:13:05.604 --> 00:13:12.586
we are here to help everyone, to make
them joyous.

00:13:12.977 --> 00:13:19.759
So one should not talk loudly, sharply,
never.

00:13:19.976 --> 00:13:25.035
And show your compassion. Now supposing
somebody has some problem:

00:13:25.236 --> 00:13:28.745
we should not suddenly say: “You are
a bhut”, no.

00:13:28.946 --> 00:13:32.424
“What’s your problem? Oh, you are
left-sided”.

00:13:32.625 --> 00:13:35.728
“What’s your problem? You are right-sided”.

00:13:35.929 --> 00:13:40.375
“All right, it can be cured. I was like
this”. If you say, they won’t feel hurt.

00:13:40.576 --> 00:13:44.586
“I was like you. You will be cured.
Don’t worry”.

00:13:44.787 --> 00:13:51.099
So we have to understand that we have
to be extremely careful

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:56.345
as to what kind of words we are using,

00:13:57.039 --> 00:14:03.776
and what kind of things we are doing
in their presence.

00:14:03.977 --> 00:14:07.859
Some people are extremely fast, they will
walk fast

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:14.285
and they will be handling things with such
a funny gestures

00:14:14.486 --> 00:14:18.060
that people will be frightened.

00:14:18.719 --> 00:14:21.517
You should not be such.

00:14:21.718 --> 00:14:29.718
What you have to do is to see that whatever
actions you take,

00:14:29.919 --> 00:14:34.049
you talk to them or do, do it in a gentle
way;

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:39.611
that’s very important to be gentle and kind
to them.

00:14:39.812 --> 00:14:46.418
Also you’ll get people who will have bhuts,
who will have gurus on their heads,

00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:49.553
like the other day that lady was arguing
with Me.

00:14:49.754 --> 00:14:53.353
Try to convince [them] and tell if the -

00:14:53.554 --> 00:14:56.557
you know now who are real and who
are unreal.

00:14:56.758 --> 00:15:00.419
If you don’t know, ask your leader.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:08.208
You better tell them that, “This is not
going to help you, it has not helped you,

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:13.200
so you have to give up.” And I’m sure
they’ll agree.

00:15:13.401 --> 00:15:15.676
I’m very sure they’ll agree.

00:15:15.877 --> 00:15:21.903
Because the way other day that Sindhi
lady, she was arguing with me.

00:15:22.104 --> 00:15:25.069
And she said that, “We get Vibhutis
[Sacred ash] in all centers.”

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:29.619
I said: “This is all bhuta vidya, preta
vidya and smashana vidya.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:35.571
What do you get out of the vibhuti that
comes in, what is so great?”

00:15:35.772 --> 00:15:41.198
All these things are just to mislead you.

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:49.199
So tell them firmly, but with full
attention,

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:55.922
that you are trying to help them. If you
want to help them

00:15:56.123 --> 00:16:04.595
then you cannot afford to be rude to them
in no way.

00:16:08.689 --> 00:16:17.539
It is sometimes difficult to handle some
people who start arguing,

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:25.655
so best is not to argue. Tell them:
“By argument we cannot convince you.

00:16:25.888 --> 00:16:29.932
It is not in the mind, it is beyond
the mind.”

00:16:30.133 --> 00:16:36.698
Up to a point it’s all right, after that
you should give up: “All right, I’m sorry.”

00:16:37.576 --> 00:16:45.693
Then your relationships in your family
should be good.

00:16:45.894 --> 00:16:51.110
You can’t have Sahaja Yoga if there is
no understanding

00:16:51.311 --> 00:16:55.625
between you, your wife, your children.

00:16:55.826 --> 00:17:01.151
We have to show that family is very
important in Sahaja Yoga,

00:17:01.352 --> 00:17:06.993
extremely important, and children are
even more important.

00:17:07.194 --> 00:17:10.850
You see how much we have done for
the children now,

00:17:11.051 --> 00:17:17.242
we have got schools, this, that, is a very
big responsibility.

00:17:17.443 --> 00:17:23.736
So we must understand what is
the responsibility.

00:17:23.937 --> 00:17:27.848
We should not spoil the children.

00:17:28.678 --> 00:17:32.920
We should appreciate whatever good they
are doing,

00:17:33.121 --> 00:17:36.044
whatever nice things they are doing.
But if they do anything wrong,

00:17:36.245 --> 00:17:41.651
you must tell them, “You are Sahaja Yogis
and you can't do like this.”

00:17:41.852 --> 00:17:46.889
That you have to tell them, whatever it is,
you have to tell them.

00:17:47.089 --> 00:17:51.202
If the children are very thin, then
understand they have got liver.

00:17:51.403 --> 00:17:53.067
So liver should be treated.

00:17:53.268 --> 00:17:55.734
And next time when you come to India

00:17:55.935 --> 00:18:00.766
we are going to get you all the medicines
of liver.

00:18:01.009 --> 00:18:04.782
If they are very fat, then they are
left-sided.

00:18:04.983 --> 00:18:11.051
Try to bring them to the centre with
the three candle treatment.

00:18:11.733 --> 00:18:14.847
But first of all, test it what is
the situation.

00:18:15.048 --> 00:18:19.832
Sometimes they develop a puffy fat, [that]
is all right, but they become all right.

00:18:20.033 --> 00:18:23.311
So that is how you should look after
their health.

00:18:23.512 --> 00:18:30.507
Then also look after their behaviour.
Tell them how to behave.

00:18:30.708 --> 00:18:35.209
As I have seen in the West the children
are not properly brought up

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:39.326
because the parents neglect them, I won’t
blame the children.

00:18:39.527 --> 00:18:42.940
Parents neglect them. You should be
loving, kind -

00:18:43.141 --> 00:18:50.246
at the same time you must tell them what
is discipline is. It is very important.

00:18:50.446 --> 00:18:56.527
Then keep a-watch on them: How they are,
what they are doing.

00:18:56.728 --> 00:19:01.310
Of course, we have a school, but it has
limited seats there.

00:19:01.511 --> 00:19:08.428
Whatever it is, they are going to adjust
as many as possible.

00:19:08.629 --> 00:19:14.627
Even then supposing you have any problem,
don’t go arbitrarily into it.

00:19:14.828 --> 00:19:23.605
You may ask your leader or you may write
to Me and inform Me.

00:19:23.806 --> 00:19:27.619
Among you somebody might become very
ego-oriented,

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:31.203
may start his own organisation, “I will
do this.”

00:19:31.404 --> 00:19:35.028
Let him say: “You get out” and he will
suffer.

00:19:35.229 --> 00:19:39.200
You do not have to worry. “All right, you
get out.”

00:19:39.401 --> 00:19:41.041
Anybody who is arbitrary will not work out.

00:19:41.242 --> 00:19:44.145
Supposing one finger starts acting more
than the rest –

00:19:44.346 --> 00:19:47.828
that means there is cancer, this is
malignancy.

00:19:48.029 --> 00:19:49.830
So we can’t have malignancy.

00:19:50.031 --> 00:19:54.816
All of you should work together with
understanding,

00:19:55.017 --> 00:20:01.929
before others as well as among yourselves.
It is very important to understand.

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:05.243
Now, Sahaja Yoga has worked out in so
many countries.

00:20:05.444 --> 00:20:10.050
In such a big way in some, in such a small
way in some.

00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:17.725
But wherever it is, Sahaja Yogis have to be
something special.

00:20:17.926 --> 00:20:23.137
Even the children have to be something
special.

00:20:24.073 --> 00:20:27.271
You have any other problem which you do
not want to discuss,

00:20:27.472 --> 00:20:32.461
with, say, with your leader, then you can
write to Me directly, no harm.

00:20:32.662 --> 00:20:36.515
Either, if I answer well and good, if I do
not answer also well and good,

00:20:36.716 --> 00:20:39.853
it will work out.

00:20:41.283 --> 00:20:45.889
But attention should not be all the time
about yourself:

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:50.626
me, my family, my children, my house,
my job, no.

00:20:50.827 --> 00:20:56.369
As soon as your attention is on other
people, it works out faster,

00:20:56.570 --> 00:21:00.695
it helps you very much. But on yourself:
“I am sick.

00:21:00.896 --> 00:21:05.497
I have this problem, that problem”,
nothing.

00:21:05.698 --> 00:21:10.633
You are now at a stage when you can
absolutely solve all the problems,

00:21:10.834 --> 00:21:14.476
but first and foremost thing: if your
attention is on yourself,

00:21:14.677 --> 00:21:19.249
it won’t work out. Attention should be
on others.

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:23.169
And if it has to be on yourself, attention,

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:28.481
then just find out: “What’s wrong with me?”

00:21:28.682 --> 00:21:33.088
But some people in that also go too far.
“Mother, my Agnya is catching.

00:21:33.289 --> 00:21:37.642
Mother, my this is catching…” [it] is
nothing, [it] is nonsense.

00:21:37.843 --> 00:21:42.882
Maybe you are catching from other people,
possible.

00:21:44.587 --> 00:21:47.266
There are some nice books, now already
in Sahaja Yoga

00:21:47.466 --> 00:21:55.415
translated in Chinese, luckily, and also
My tapes could be translated also.

00:21:55.616 --> 00:21:59.724
But you have to keep My voice, as I told
you,

00:21:59.925 --> 00:22:02.859
because that is mantra, isn’t it?

00:22:03.068 --> 00:22:07.571
And you can have subtitles, would be better
if you could do it.

00:22:07.772 --> 00:22:14.644
But it’s a very good idea that you can have
subtitles, really.

00:22:15.143 --> 00:22:20.202
Specially for Russians if they could do
in Russia.

00:22:20.403 --> 00:22:25.964
Now, [if] you have any questions, now you
can ask Me.

00:22:44.723 --> 00:22:48.031
So it should be always like, if you are
Chinese,

00:22:48.232 --> 00:22:53.037
then you should not only deal with Chinese.
They should all come to the collective.

00:22:53.204 --> 00:22:56.824
Supposing you are Indians, you should not
only deal with the Indians,

00:22:57.025 --> 00:22:58.867
but they should come to the collective.

00:22:59.068 --> 00:23:01.747
Because unless and until they come
to the collective

00:23:01.948 --> 00:23:04.275
[they] will not know what the problem is.

00:23:04.476 --> 00:23:07.482
It’s not that you can organise separately
a group,

00:23:07.683 --> 00:23:11.012
another group separately. It has to be
one group.

00:23:11.213 --> 00:23:16.448
Of course, you could have two ashrams
or three ashrams, makes no difference.

00:23:19.941 --> 00:23:22.720
Any other question?

00:23:22.921 --> 00:23:26.338
Yogi: Is the camphor treatment good for
left side? Shri Mataji: What?

00:23:26.539 --> 00:23:29.550
Yogi: Camphor … Yogi 2: Camphor treatment.

00:23:29.751 --> 00:23:32.795
Yogi 2: The camphor treatment. He is asking
if the camphor treatment

00:23:32.996 --> 00:23:36.181
is good for left side. Shri Mataji: What?
Yogi 2: The camphor.

00:23:36.382 --> 00:23:38.449
Shri Mataji: No no no no. No need.

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:41.397
Camphor, only once in a while. Don’t do
camphor.

00:23:41.598 --> 00:23:46.320
But you have done all mixed up things,
you see, just do left-sided treatment,

00:23:46.536 --> 00:23:49.985
then you will be all right. Just mixed up.

00:23:50.186 --> 00:23:54.010
And you cannot earn money in the name
of God

00:23:54.211 --> 00:23:57.332
or Divine work, that’s one thing.

00:23:57.533 --> 00:24:00.239
You cannot organise like that. No, never.

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:01.769
Because once you start getting it,

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:04.380
left-sided bhuts will come into you.
Yogi: I’ve never done that.

00:24:04.581 --> 00:24:09.461
Shri Mataji: That is the part of Sahaja
Yoga. We cannot.

00:24:11.954 --> 00:24:15.884
Also if you have any guru’s photographs
and all that,

00:24:16.085 --> 00:24:19.353
it’s better to put them in the sea.

00:24:19.561 --> 00:24:26.143
Because this keeping any photograph,
any book about them creates problems.

00:24:26.344 --> 00:24:33.391
So religiously search it out and put them
in the sea.

00:24:33.592 --> 00:24:36.416
[Video interrupts brieftly]

00:24:36.876 --> 00:24:39.616
No no no no no no. No no no no. Don’t do
all that.

00:24:39.817 --> 00:24:44.554
They will work on the photograph. If you
want to help somebody, you see,

00:24:44.755 --> 00:24:49.897
some other people who have come, whom
you want to raise, don’t touch them.

00:24:50.098 --> 00:24:55.634
Take a bandhan yourself and give them
a bandhan.

00:24:55.835 --> 00:24:59.490
Put them before the photograph and you
just raise the Kundalini.

00:24:59.691 --> 00:25:08.547
But be careful. Because you are still,
you see, not that sort of thing

00:25:08.748 --> 00:25:12.566
that you cannot catch, you might catch.

00:25:12.767 --> 00:25:18.885
So among yourselves also you should not
do that. Don’t touch.

00:25:19.086 --> 00:25:21.673
If somebody says, “I have this problem”,
all right,

00:25:21.874 --> 00:25:26.187
put him on the photograph, take a bandhan
yourself,

00:25:26.388 --> 00:25:29.944
ask him to take a bandhan, you also give
a bandhan

00:25:30.105 --> 00:25:34.777
and then raise the Kundalini. Be careful.

00:25:38.647 --> 00:25:42.655
Even if there is somebody who has come
now who is a sick man.

00:25:42.856 --> 00:25:48.080
So you can give them a photograph, [it] is
all right, if they are willing to do it.

00:25:48.281 --> 00:25:54.941
But somebody in his family is willing
to take Sahaja Yoga,

00:25:55.142 --> 00:26:00.219
who is a healthy person, he should bring.
Otherwise don’t get after sick.

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:04.199
You will have many sick, in thousands
to begin with.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.941
Don’t worry about sick.

00:26:08.983 --> 00:26:13.681
Or if they are sick tell them to take
the photograph

00:26:13.882 --> 00:26:17.869
and work it out, if they are left-sided
or right-sided.

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:20.620
Then the faith grows, they improve.

00:26:20.821 --> 00:26:24.542
But you don’t touch the sick. No, no,
not at all.

00:26:24.743 --> 00:26:33.569
We are not here to cure the sick, but we
are here to give realisation.

00:26:38.151 --> 00:26:42.462
May God bless you.
Yogi: Shri Mataji, for technique,

00:26:42.663 --> 00:26:45.465
if you have a problem on one side, you have
imbalance

00:26:45.666 --> 00:26:50.510
and if the left side is weak or caught up,
do you raise the Kundalini

00:26:50.711 --> 00:26:53.867
on this side and give a bandhan
to the other side? Correct?

00:26:54.068 --> 00:26:56.705
Shri Mataji: Yes.

00:26:58.216 --> 00:27:03.837
Supposing you are right-sided,

00:27:04.077 --> 00:27:08.782
then you have to put down the right side,

00:27:09.583 --> 00:27:13.278
remember that way, it’s much better.

00:27:13.479 --> 00:27:17.217
So then you raise your left side and put
the right side down,

00:27:17.425 --> 00:27:19.602
if you have right-side problem.

00:27:19.803 --> 00:27:25.696
Now, if you have a left-side problem, so
you have to put down the left side.

00:27:25.897 --> 00:27:34.211
It’s easier to remember this way. So
there is no confusion.

00:27:39.449 --> 00:27:43.915
But tying up of Kundalini should be done
after you have moved out

00:27:44.116 --> 00:27:46.258
left to right or right to left, whichever
way.

00:27:46.459 --> 00:27:52.405
Then raise your Kundalini and tie up and
take a bandhan,

00:27:52.606 --> 00:27:55.553
it’s the best way.

00:28:03.792 --> 00:28:08.000
I would request you, all of you, to take
a photograph of yours

00:28:08.201 --> 00:28:15.085
and make an album, write it down below
that: what is your name,

00:28:15.286 --> 00:28:20.556
date of birth and of Self-realisation.

00:28:20.757 --> 00:28:25.695
Send it over to Me. Because I go on seeing
them sometimes, you see.

00:28:25.896 --> 00:28:30.791
So I’ll know you better and also I’ll have
My attention on you.

00:28:30.992 --> 00:28:36.509
Of the children as well as of bigger
people.

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:43.496
So I’ll talk to you and talk to him

00:28:43.697 --> 00:28:46.775
because you have little individual
problems, both of you.

00:28:46.976 --> 00:28:51.172
What about you? Are you reconciled?

00:28:54.765 --> 00:28:59.915
I’m going to get, you see, this one,
Werner, to task.

00:29:00.116 --> 00:29:03.949
He came here to do Sahaja Yoga and not
to disturb a family.

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:11.078
He’s been very wrong. I’m going to be
very angry with him.

00:29:13.146 --> 00:29:17.643
He is an old Sahaja Yogi, he should have
behaved himself.

00:29:17.844 --> 00:29:23.088
It’s not - never to disturb a family. You
have such sweet beautiful children.

00:29:23.289 --> 00:29:27.737
I will never support you in nonsense,
I must tell you.

00:29:27.938 --> 00:29:31.982
And your husband is a very good man. If you
behave all right

00:29:32.183 --> 00:29:36.265
he’ll come round to Sahaja Yoga, I’m sure.

00:29:36.466 --> 00:29:41.033
You cannot be a Sahaja Yogi if you have
no dharma,

00:29:41.234 --> 00:29:54.193
“shield” as Buddha has called it. It’s what
we call as your character.

00:29:54.394 --> 00:29:59.495
Your morality is the most important
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:59.696 --> 00:30:04.619
If you are not moral, it has no meaning
at all.

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:10.185
What we need is morality today. This is
happening everywhere, nonsense.

00:30:10.386 --> 00:30:19.033
We have to imbibe it in ourselves and we
have to generate it for others also.

00:30:19.234 --> 00:30:22.457
Whole world is full of immoral people.

00:30:22.658 --> 00:30:27.941
A very, very few who are standing
for morality.

00:30:28.142 --> 00:30:34.781
That is the greatest ornament we have.

00:30:38.707 --> 00:30:46.422
All right? Don’t go astray. This will never
help you.

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:52.033
It was very wrong of you and also for
your children.

00:30:52.234 --> 00:30:56.464
Now go back and behave yourself properly,

00:30:56.665 --> 00:31:00.735
otherwise you cannot be in Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:08.008 --> 00:31:13.730
Ha, if there was something wrong, then
it’s all right.

00:31:13.931 --> 00:31:17.608
We have divorce in Sahaja Yoga. We allow
people to divorce.

00:31:17.809 --> 00:31:22.528
But there should be substantial reason
for that.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.187
“Or to sub thik hai” [Is everything
all right?] What are we to do?

00:31:34.388 --> 00:31:36.707
That will do? All right.
Yogi: Thank You, Mother.

00:31:36.908 --> 00:31:39.747
Shri Mataji: May God Bless you all.

00:31:39.931 --> 00:31:44.222
I am sorry you had to come so late
in the night.

00:31:44.423 --> 00:31:46.670
Yogi: Mother, we have a small gift for You.

00:31:46.854 --> 00:31:50.686
Shri Mataji: Why, you’ve done so much!

00:31:53.441 --> 00:31:59.131
Oh. Where is the children’s this thing,
presents?

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:10.579
My God, a small present, is it?
Yogi: It’s very small.

00:32:25.737 --> 00:32:28.954
Shri Mataji: All right, what is this?

00:32:29.155 --> 00:32:32.994
This is supposed to be small, is it?
From what angle?

00:32:33.195 --> 00:32:37.974
Yogi: It’s just a big box!
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.

00:32:44.862 --> 00:32:50.311
Ah. So now. What is that? Let’s see.

00:32:53.536 --> 00:32:56.750
My goodness.

00:32:58.973 --> 00:33:02.260
This is the one for what?
Yogis: Confucius.

00:33:02.461 --> 00:33:04.647
Yogis: Confucius. Guru.

00:33:04.848 --> 00:33:07.847
Shri Mataji: Confucius!

00:33:12.499 --> 00:33:20.638
He too has… you see?
Yogi: A stick.

00:33:23.863 --> 00:33:27.955
Shri Mataji: Fine, such an expensive one.

00:33:29.613 --> 00:33:34.915
Great. It’s very well done.

00:33:35.826 --> 00:33:40.006
Is it written here Confucius?
Yogi: Yes.

00:33:41.054 --> 00:33:47.149
Shri Mataji: All right. Thank you very
much.

00:33:47.698 --> 00:33:49.859
But you’ll have to bring it to India when
you come.

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:52.997
[Yogi: “Yes, Shri Mataji”.]

00:33:56.071 --> 00:33:58.178
But such an expensive thing, you should not
have bought it.

00:33:58.379 --> 00:34:02.615
Yogi: Very good price, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Really?

00:34:02.816 --> 00:34:05.881
What is this? Yogi: This is Lao-Zi.
Yogi: Lao-Zi.

00:34:06.082 --> 00:34:09.273
Yogini: Lao-Tse. Yogi: Lao-Tse.
Shri Mataji: This is Lao-Tse?

00:34:09.474 --> 00:34:12.437
Nice!

00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:52.051
All right. He’s great I must say, Lao-Tse.

00:34:57.968 --> 00:35:03.921
Beautiful. He’s sitting on the clouds.

00:35:07.194 --> 00:35:09.710
Beautiful.

00:35:13.796 --> 00:35:17.984
[Yogini: “Wow”.] Good.

00:35:21.649 --> 00:35:27.111
This is His vahana. This is the one, is…
Yogi: Vehicle.

00:35:27.312 --> 00:35:29.219
Shri Mataji: Vahana, you know, this vahana
is …

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:31.999
Yogi: Vehicle, isn’t it? Vehicle?
Shri Mataji: Conveyance.

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:35.796
Yogi: Conveyance, yes.
Yogini: Conveyance, yes.

00:35:38.906 --> 00:35:44.074
Shri Mataji: Beautifully done. Thank you
very much, thank you.

00:35:44.275 --> 00:35:50.510
Is written here?
Yogi: This is Lao-Tse.

00:35:54.252 --> 00:35:57.243
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much.

00:36:00.809 --> 00:36:06.755
This shows the little boy is controlling.
(Unclear) This is what?

00:36:06.956 --> 00:36:11.358
[Inaudible comments – Yogini: “This is
a cloth, and yes, a...”.

00:36:11.559 --> 00:36:15.314
Yogi: “A Goddess”.
Yogini: “A Goddess…”.]

00:36:36.138 --> 00:36:38.513
Shri Mataji: Who is that?
Yogi: Is a Goddess.

00:36:38.727 --> 00:36:42.369
Yogi: Goddess. Goddess. She is from China.

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:44.431
Shri Mataji: Goddess. Yogis and Yoginis:
From China. Yes. A Goddess.

00:36:44.632 --> 00:36:48.030
Shri Mataji: Saraswati.
[Indistinct comments]

00:36:48.231 --> 00:36:54.546
Shri Mataji: Ah, it looks like Saraswati.
Very Indian silk.

00:36:56.294 --> 00:36:59.225
Yogi: Yes, we had this picture when
Buddhism first came…

00:36:59.426 --> 00:37:02.026
Yogi: We had this kind of picture

00:37:02.227 --> 00:37:06.938
when Buddhism first came to China.
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.

00:37:07.139 --> 00:37:12.264
Buddhism didn’t talk of women.

00:37:15.864 --> 00:37:22.648
Beautiful, very beautiful. Thank you very
much, thank you. Beautiful.

00:37:25.371 --> 00:37:28.484
Very well done.

00:37:37.515 --> 00:37:42.720
These two books he gave Me, where are
they? All right.

00:37:42.921 --> 00:37:46.788
You can keep them – please keep it
somewhere.

00:37:46.989 --> 00:37:50.103
Now what is that?
Yogini: From Vietnam.

00:37:50.304 --> 00:37:52.122
Yogini: Yes, it’s from Vietnam.

00:37:52.323 --> 00:37:53.462
Yogi: From Vietnam.
Shri Mataji: From Vietnam?

00:37:53.663 --> 00:37:56.188
Yogi: Vietnam.
Yogini: Yes, from Malaysia collective.

00:37:56.389 --> 00:37:58.736
Shri Mataji: You are from Vietnam?
Yogini: Yes.

00:37:58.937 --> 00:38:02.126
Shri Mataji: Really?
Yogini: Yes.

00:38:06.593 --> 00:38:10.505
Shri Mataji: One place I’ve not been to
is Vietnam.

00:38:10.714 --> 00:38:15.958
But [to] Korea I’ve been - South Korea
I’ve been.

00:38:36.899 --> 00:38:38.678
[Yogini (not clearly audible): “Lacquer
and sewing”]

00:38:38.879 --> 00:38:44.667
Oh, they make these in Vietnam?
Yogini: Yes.

00:38:44.868 --> 00:38:48.560
Yogi: It’s a beautiful thing through sewing.
Shri Mataji: It’s beautiful.

00:38:48.761 --> 00:38:51.570
Is a painting?
Yogis: It’s a lacquer. Lacquer work.

00:38:51.771 --> 00:38:57.493
Shri Mataji: Lacquer work. Thank you
very much.

00:38:59.589 --> 00:39:06.663
So beautiful. Such a big lacquer work
I’ve never seen.

00:39:23.166 --> 00:39:29.046
Must be very expensive.
Yogini: We got it quite at a good price.

00:39:29.247 --> 00:39:35.049
Shri Mataji: Very beautiful. Thank you
very much.

00:39:35.627 --> 00:39:40.241
You want to take? Too close.

00:39:40.442 --> 00:39:44.298
[Yogi: “That’s we can take later.”]

00:39:46.174 --> 00:39:49.812
I’ll hold it.

00:40:04.901 --> 00:40:08.282
Very beautiful.

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:23.600
Oh, thank you.

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:31.968
All this has to come when you come
to Ganapatipule.

00:40:32.169 --> 00:40:35.759
Yogi: Actually, I would have loved one
Chinese to come this time.

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:39.599
I’ll have to get lot more to carry all
these things.

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:44.799
Shri Mataji: See, what I was saying,
for all the people from the East,

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.562
there’s a concession they offer and it’s
much cheaper.

00:40:48.763 --> 00:40:54.885
I think what you can carry is quite a lot
but I don't know, they told Me...

00:40:55.086 --> 00:40:58.520
I don't know how much – quite a bit
[not clearly audible].

00:40:58.721 --> 00:41:02.650
So I think they can come, Chinese.

00:41:07.825 --> 00:41:14.321
At least Ganapatipule. I've no idea,
I'll ask them.

00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:31.458
Last time who went on the tour from here?
Complete tour - was a complete.

00:41:31.666 --> 00:41:40.289
Yogi: Well, I was on the 11th of December.
[Indistinct conversation follows]

00:41:50.099 --> 00:41:53.672
Shri Mataji: This is for children.

00:41:54.487 --> 00:42:00.744
Now. So we’ll have boys first, come along.

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:08.449
May God bless you. Now you have to write
poems in this, all right?

00:42:10.223 --> 00:42:13.384
You move forward.

00:42:16.338 --> 00:42:22.107
Is there any other boy? Come along.

00:42:22.338 --> 00:42:30.847
You must write poems. Thank you.
Come along.

00:42:33.119 --> 00:42:40.047
You are a boy also! Kuber, come along.

00:42:50.395 --> 00:42:54.466
He’s done the pay week for Me.

00:42:55.661 --> 00:42:58.964
Now for the girls.

00:43:00.557 --> 00:43:05.907
He’s done a beautiful painting today,
you see?

00:43:29.318 --> 00:43:32.222
Did you do this one?
Child: Yes.

00:43:32.423 --> 00:43:37.234
Shri Mataji: Thank you. Good. Thank you.

00:43:39.066 --> 00:43:42.695
[Conversation aside with a yogi] Where is
that tea set we had bought? Did you get it?

00:43:42.896 --> 00:43:46.611
[Yogi: “Yes. Tea seats were at the back,
yes, two. There were two tea sets, Mother.

00:43:46.812 --> 00:43:49.727
I took the small one. The small one”.]

00:43:49.928 --> 00:43:55.320
Let it be now, you took only one so will
be a problem. All right.

00:43:55.543 --> 00:44:00.854
Who will get? I was thinking of dolls.
All right, for the girls.

00:44:01.055 --> 00:44:09.596
Now. You write poems. All right.
Come along.

00:44:13.702 --> 00:44:19.043
You want - which one you want? All right?

00:44:19.244 --> 00:44:23.580
Who else? All the girls.

00:44:27.731 --> 00:44:30.525
Ah.

00:44:36.908 --> 00:44:39.824
Yes, good.

00:44:46.933 --> 00:44:52.647
Very wise. Thank you.

00:45:01.932 --> 00:45:09.060
Just… [To another girl] Which one?
All right.

00:45:12.467 --> 00:45:15.366
[Aside to a girl] Did you get one?
Girl: No, it’s ok.

00:45:15.574 --> 00:45:17.638
Shri Mataji: Is it all right?
Girl: It’s all right.

00:45:17.839 --> 00:45:19.973
Shri Mataji: Very sweet.
Girl: They need it…

00:45:20.174 --> 00:45:23.864
Boy: They need it more than you.
Shri Mataji: Ah?

00:45:24.872 --> 00:45:32.907
We could give her that tea set, and all
that, so we have. Can you find that?

00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:39.394
Girl: Thank you, Mataji.
Shri Mataji: May God bless you.

00:45:58.848 --> 00:46:03.300
All right, come along, you are lucky.

00:46:03.501 --> 00:46:07.639
Quite heavy. May God bless you.
Girl: Thank you very much.

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:12.294
Shri Mataji: Thank you, thank you.
Girl: Thank you.

00:46:13.487 --> 00:46:16.215
Shri Mataji: You got it, Rishi?
Sahaja Yogi: Such cool vibrations.

00:46:16.416 --> 00:46:21.002
[Unclear] [Indistinct conversation]

00:46:21.962 --> 00:46:25.456
Shri Mataji: All right, Soma is better now?
Yogi: Yes, it has improved…

00:46:25.657 --> 00:46:29.300
Shri Mataji: Better, yes.
Yogi: … since she came to Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:33.162
Girl: Thank you very much, Shri Mataji.

00:46:33.363 --> 00:46:36.320
Shri Mataji: Next time I would like to see
your poems.

00:46:36.521 --> 00:46:42.524
All right? Kuber, you too.

00:46:43.691 --> 00:46:50.563
And also nice drawings. Where is
the drawing gone of Kuber?

00:46:50.772 --> 00:46:55.404
This I want to take with Me.
It’s refreshing.

00:46:58.853 --> 00:47:03.051
All right. May God bless you. May God
bless you.

00:47:03.252 --> 00:47:08.176
Look after yourself. And know that you are
Sahaja Yogis,

00:47:08.377 --> 00:47:13.209
is a very big position, you are saints.
Special people.

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:16.479
You are the foundation.

00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:22.837
Anyway I may go to mainland China and
talk to the…

00:47:24.832 --> 00:47:32.363
Let’s see if Prime Minister listens to Me.
May be.

00:47:32.564 --> 00:47:35.604
May God bless you.

00:47:38.859 --> 00:47:43.621
Yogis: Thank you, Mother.
Shri Mataji: It’s all right.

00:47:43.822 --> 00:47:46.040
Yogi: Thank You Mother, for coming
to Hong Kong…

00:47:46.241 --> 00:47:50.428
Shri Mataji: Wah-wah.
Yogi: …and blessing us all.

00:47:55.153 --> 00:47:57.655
Shri Mataji: You just wait and - you just
wait. [Yogi: “OK”.]

00:47:57.856 --> 00:48:01.468
Then I will go and talk to him.

00:48:01.669 --> 00:48:04.708
May God bless you.

00:48:07.826 --> 00:48:13.321
And I think people are very simple, very
simple people in North Korea.

00:48:13.522 --> 00:48:16.000
You are South-Korean? Yogini: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Ah, I went to South Korea,

00:48:16.201 --> 00:48:20.630
I’m sorry, not North, South Korea.

00:48:20.831 --> 00:48:27.431
But you see, still they have no idea
of a spiritual life. No idea.

00:48:27.632 --> 00:48:31.329
So, you go there quite often?
Yogini: Yes, tomorrow I’ll go there.

00:48:31.530 --> 00:48:33.145
Shri Mataji: She goes to… She goes…

00:48:33.346 --> 00:48:35.422
Yogini 2: She is my sister who came here
today.

00:48:35.623 --> 00:48:39.843
Shri Mataji: So start talking about Sahaja
Yoga. All right?

00:48:40.044 --> 00:48:46.886
Yogini: Yes. It’s the first time…
Shri Mataji: No, no, you can do it.

00:48:47.087 --> 00:48:51.087
So have programme, or something. And get
more people here

00:48:51.288 --> 00:48:59.371
from South Korea. And send them over.
You can do very well.

00:48:59.572 --> 00:49:02.758
Too much American influence.
[Yogini: “Right”.]

00:49:02.959 --> 00:49:11.952
That’s the problem. And also then I saw
one programme

00:49:12.153 --> 00:49:16.005
they had invited us to, supposed to be
a very special one.

00:49:16.206 --> 00:49:22.579
And we were sitting on the top from
the galleries, you see, for VIPs

00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:26.748
and downstairs, and I’ve never seen
such a show.

00:49:26.956 --> 00:49:31.908
Very dirty show they showed. Very dirty.

00:49:32.109 --> 00:49:35.470
I’ve never seen. And CP was wearing his
glasses and he just closed his eyes,

00:49:35.671 --> 00:49:38.497
and I had to, said it, “Close your eyes,
you can’t bear it”.

00:49:38.706 --> 00:49:44.303
And both of us vomited. Leave show.

00:49:44.504 --> 00:49:48.571
I’ve never seen such a dirt anywhere.

00:49:49.146 --> 00:49:52.314
You know, I mean, can’t imagine how
they have

00:49:52.515 --> 00:49:57.594
taken these things from these stupid
Americans.

00:49:58.963 --> 00:50:02.070
You can work it out, all right?
May God bless you.

00:50:02.271 --> 00:50:06.082
Yoginis: Thank You, Mother.

00:50:06.283 --> 00:50:09.991
Shri Mataji: We have to think of our
countries, we have to save them.

00:50:10.192 --> 00:50:17.029
Don’t you think so? It’s very important,
to save your own country.

00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:23.689
Just I give you all the powers.
May God bless you.

00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:27.041
First grow in Sahaja Yoga, first grow
in Sahaja Yoga,

00:50:27.242 --> 00:50:29.437
these people can also come sometimes.

00:50:29.638 --> 00:50:35.422
We can send some other people. We could
have programmes. All right?

00:50:35.623 --> 00:50:37.142
May God bless you. Yogini: Are You going
to come to Korea again?

00:50:37.343 --> 00:50:40.206
Yogini: Are You going
to come to Korea again, another time?

00:50:40.414 --> 00:50:42.539
Yogi: She is asking if You are you going
to come to Korea.

00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:48.400
Shri Mataji: Anyone at this time - I’m
so busy now, I don’t know.

00:50:48.601 --> 00:50:54.053
Keeping Me too busy. That’s all right,
I think it will work out.

00:50:54.254 --> 00:50:57.496
These people can go and work it out.
All right?

00:50:57.743 --> 00:51:01.454
Yogini: Thank you. /Shri Mataji: May God
bless you. /Yogini: Thank you.

00:51:01.655 --> 00:51:04.634
Shri Mataji: So, are you feeling better
now, with him?

00:51:04.835 --> 00:51:07.095
You have Ekadasha, you know?
Yogini: Yes, I know.

00:51:07.296 --> 00:51:11.252
Shri Mataji: Ekadasha means beginning
of cancer, do you know?

00:51:11.453 --> 00:51:16.190
Don’t struggle anymore. You know,
no mother can live without children.

00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:22.088
See, all this is a temporary sort
of infatuation, finished, is this.

00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:24.330
Mother is a mother.

00:51:24.531 --> 00:51:29.366
How she stands, you know, for her children.
All right? That’s more important.
