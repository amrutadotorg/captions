WEBVTT

00:00.585 --> 00:05.492
All right. Put your hands towards Me.

00:11.264 --> 00:14.321
First of all, I must say

00:14.522 --> 00:21.644
I am very happy to see so many Sahaja
Yogis in Hong Kong.

00:24.654 --> 00:29.170
Hong Kong is a very materialistic place,
as you know,

00:29.371 --> 00:32.950
and people are too busy,

00:34.016 --> 00:38.036
but the problems come out of that busyness.

00:38.237 --> 00:42.151
All this busy life creates lots
of problems.

00:42.352 --> 00:50.374
So I am sure there will be more coming
from the last program, definitely,

00:53.184 --> 00:58.296
lots of them, and your hands will be full.

00:58.875 --> 01:02.450
So I just wanted to tell you

01:02.651 --> 01:10.832
what should we really do to achieve
the maximum results.

01:11.055 --> 01:17.244
First of all, we have to establish

01:17.445 --> 01:23.944
that we are Sahaja Yogis, we are very
sober people

01:25.134 --> 01:33.499
and we have among ourselves tremendous
respect and love.

01:33.922 --> 01:37.086
So one should never support

01:37.287 --> 01:43.163
an outsider who is not yet a Sahaja Yogi
or who will be a Sahaja Yogi

01:43.364 --> 01:47.250
but support each other, all the time.

01:47.451 --> 01:51.997
Do not argue among yourselves.

01:52.198 --> 01:57.295
Maybe one person may be wrong, I am
not saying.

01:57.496 --> 02:04.285
But [it] is important that we should
support each other,

02:04.486 --> 02:08.481
and above all, we must support the leader.

02:08.682 --> 02:12.986
Whatever the leader says, we must listen
to him.

02:13.187 --> 02:21.134
It’s very important, in Sahaja Yoga we are
a collective organisation,

02:21.335 --> 02:25.420
that too a living organisation.

02:25.621 --> 02:31.137
If somebody is not collective, he is thrown
out of Sahaja Yoga.

02:31.338 --> 02:33.977
We are not very happy with such people.

02:34.178 --> 02:38.187
So you must try to put

02:47.839 --> 02:56.078
all effort to see that you are all
collectively one

02:56.279 --> 02:59.685
and say the same thing.

02:59.926 --> 03:05.867
This is very important to know.

03:06.334 --> 03:12.502
Also there are people who may not be
so good among you

03:12.703 --> 03:17.353
who can judge the vibrations, possibly.

03:17.554 --> 03:21.996
If so, you should ask your leader.

03:22.197 --> 03:25.651
But among yourselves you should never
argue, because we know

03:25.852 --> 03:30.165
that Sahaja Yoga gives you absolute truth.

03:30.366 --> 03:32.980
So others should not doubt

03:33.181 --> 03:39.710
by your behaviour that these people don’t
know anything. All right?

03:39.911 --> 03:46.753
Then second thing of Sahaja Yoga is that
it is the power of love,

03:46.954 --> 03:50.395
it’s of compassion, of divine love.

03:50.596 --> 03:54.204
Must understand what is divine love is.

03:54.405 --> 03:59.045
That is the love that is the, like the sap,
as I always say,

03:59.246 --> 04:08.339
that runs in the tree. It gives nourishment
to the roots,

04:08.540 --> 04:19.386
then to all parts of the tree, and then
it evaporates or it goes down.

04:19.586 --> 04:27.534
Supposing it gets stuck into one flower,
what will happen

04:27.735 --> 04:32.710
that the tree will die, and ultimately
the flower will also die.

04:32.911 --> 04:38.422
So our love is not limited love.

04:38.623 --> 04:42.752
Like, we love our children, all right,
[we] love other children also.

04:42.953 --> 04:52.180
Everybody is absolutely in full pure love
with each other.

04:52.381 --> 05:00.808
Now, one must understand the pure love,
that it is not attached to anyone,

05:01.009 --> 05:05.011
but at the same time, it is pure love.

05:05.212 --> 05:14.651
If you don’t have pure love in your heart
because the culture is different,

05:14.866 --> 05:26.805
people start moving their attention and
spoiling their attention.

05:27.281 --> 05:30.967
So, so many people asked Me: “Mother,
what to do?”

05:31.168 --> 05:35.329
I said: “Keep your eyes only up to three
feet,

05:35.530 --> 05:39.600
so you will see beautiful things, like you
will see flowers,

05:39.801 --> 05:45.098
you will see children, and nothing
horrible”.

05:45.299 --> 05:53.019
So, whatever makes your attention
disturbed, try to avoid.

05:53.220 --> 05:58.644
Best is to concentrate on your meditation.

05:59.203 --> 06:06.146
For meditation in the morning you can
just put

06:06.347 --> 06:10.960
your right hand towards the photograph

06:13.525 --> 06:17.474
and the left hand up there.

06:17.755 --> 06:23.997
Then put your left hand towards
the photograph… - like this.

06:24.363 --> 06:30.098
Then left hand towards the photograph
and right hand on the Mother Earth.

06:30.299 --> 06:36.184
[It] is better to sit on the ground,
in the morning.

06:36.739 --> 06:43.470
Then, if thoughtless awareness is
established

06:43.670 --> 06:48.181
by looking at the photograph, close your
eyes.

06:48.451 --> 06:53.384
Now, some people say: “Mother, my heart
is not open”. All right.

06:53.585 --> 06:58.222
So you can say, looking at the Mother:

06:58.423 --> 07:04.355
“Mother, please, come in my heart.”

07:04.556 --> 07:07.822
Somebody’s Sahasrara is not open.

07:08.022 --> 07:12.162
Then you have to say: “Mother, please
come in my head”.

07:12.363 --> 07:15.132
With both the hands.

07:15.333 --> 07:22.102
Whatever portion you think in the body
is not doing well,

07:22.303 --> 07:28.001
I am always available, so you can ask.

07:30.105 --> 07:33.332
Your meditation should be good, first
and foremost.

07:33.533 --> 07:39.364
If you are good Sahaja Yogis, then only
others will believe you.

07:39.564 --> 07:44.826
But if you are not good Sahaja Yogis,
nobody will believe you.

07:45.027 --> 07:49.268
For so many people I have seen I am
something beyond them.

07:49.469 --> 07:53.941
But Sahaja Yogis are the ones which really
make them feel

07:54.142 --> 07:58.237
that “these are extraordinary people”.

08:00.946 --> 08:07.088
Then, after that, dealing with them
as I said,

08:07.289 --> 08:14.315
has to be absolutely with pure attention.

08:14.516 --> 08:17.830
To begin with, the men should deal only
with men

08:18.031 --> 08:22.287
and the women should deal only with women

08:22.488 --> 08:25.519
and no complications should come out.

08:25.720 --> 08:29.889
Because that is the biggest blemish Sahaja
Yoga can have,

08:30.090 --> 08:34.377
that they are just like ordinary people.

08:38.189 --> 08:42.632
So, you have to be careful about yourself.

08:42.833 --> 08:47.512
Before sleeping, if you have time, you must
do footsoaking.

08:47.713 --> 08:50.777
If one day you do not do it, don’t torture
yourself for that,

08:50.978 --> 08:55.004
but it’s better that you do footsoaking.

08:55.205 --> 09:00.040
And in footsoaking first of all you
must know

09:00.241 --> 09:04.410
what sort of a personality you have.

09:04.642 --> 09:07.985
Mostly you are right-sided, mostly.

09:08.186 --> 09:11.045
So put [your] right hand towards
the photograph,

09:11.246 --> 09:17.320
both the feet in the water with little salt
and left hand like that.

09:17.521 --> 09:20.982
But some are left-sided, some are
definitely very much.

09:21.183 --> 09:24.185
They should not touch water.

09:24.386 --> 09:30.565
Two types of treatments are there.

09:30.766 --> 09:35.707
Especially left-sided people should
not soak,

09:35.908 --> 09:41.203
should not use ice. This is all right-sided
treatment.

09:41.404 --> 09:46.756
After doing your right-sided or left-sided
treatment,

09:46.957 --> 09:53.209
I would say you put both your hands towards
the photograph

09:53.766 --> 09:58.437
and see for yourself how it is working out,

10:00.349 --> 10:04.504
without water, without candle.

10:04.816 --> 10:08.525
But I would again say that right-sided
people should not

10:08.726 --> 10:12.673
use candle as far as possible.

10:15.067 --> 10:20.232
This electricity is all right, you can
use it.

10:20.433 --> 10:23.186
They should not sit in the sun, they should
put

10:23.387 --> 10:27.183
ice on their liver; also they can put ice
here

10:27.384 --> 10:30.574
when it is very hot, it’s very good to put
ice here.

10:30.775 --> 10:35.308
Also for diabetes you can put the ice here.

10:36.885 --> 10:40.233
In Sahaja Yoga the treatment is very
simple:

10:40.434 --> 10:45.096
for right-sided people very simple, and
for left-sided.

10:45.297 --> 10:49.514
Right-sided people get problems like liver,

10:49.715 --> 10:56.060
diabetes, blood cancer,

10:57.418 --> 11:01.270
kidney coagulation,

11:01.471 --> 11:06.986
that means they can’t pass urine,
constipation,

11:07.500 --> 11:14.174
also asthma, heart attack – massive,

11:14.375 --> 11:23.655
and also paralysis, on the right side;
so many.

11:23.856 --> 11:31.043
Now, the left-sided people get pain
all over left side;

11:31.244 --> 11:38.156
also can get all kinds of psychosomatic
diseases which are not curable,

11:38.357 --> 11:47.258
like cancer, myelitis, Parkinson’s,
all kinds.

11:48.735 --> 11:51.318
But if you do your meditation every day,

11:51.519 --> 11:54.235
once in a while you may miss it, it doesn’t
matter,

11:54.435 --> 11:59.335
you will immediately feel that you are
completely cured

11:59.536 --> 12:03.296
and you keep good health.

12:03.497 --> 12:07.072
That’s the only way you can grow.

12:07.273 --> 12:15.585
And try to bring the point where you are
thoughtlessly aware.

12:15.786 --> 12:23.391
The best way to be thoughtless is to say
the mantra of Nirvichara.

12:24.007 --> 12:27.978
That’s very important. And secondly,

12:28.179 --> 12:30.770
to go on for forgiving: “I forgive
everyone, I forgive everyone”

12:30.971 --> 12:38.615
so the thoughts will stop. That is the time
when you are in the present.

12:38.816 --> 12:44.969
That is the time really you will grow
in spirituality.

12:46.528 --> 12:51.341
We have people in India and abroad

12:51.542 --> 12:55.052
who have become such powerful Sahaja Yogis

12:55.253 --> 12:59.668
that just by prayer they can achieve
lot of things.

12:59.869 --> 13:05.403
We are not here to destroy anyone
or to torture anyone:

13:05.604 --> 13:12.586
we are here to help everyone, to make
them joyous.

13:12.977 --> 13:19.759
So one should not talk loudly, sharply,
never.

13:19.976 --> 13:25.035
And show your compassion. Now supposing
somebody has some problem:

13:25.236 --> 13:28.745
we should not suddenly say: “You are
a bhut”, no.

13:28.946 --> 13:32.424
“What’s your problem? Oh, you are
left-sided”.

13:32.625 --> 13:35.728
“What’s your problem? You are right-sided”.

13:35.929 --> 13:40.375
“All right, it can be cured. I was like
this”. If you say, they won’t feel hurt.

13:40.576 --> 13:44.586
“I was like you. You will be cured.
Don’t worry”.

13:44.787 --> 13:51.099
So we have to understand that we have
to be extremely careful

13:51.300 --> 13:56.345
as to what kind of words we are using,

13:57.039 --> 14:03.776
and what kind of things we are doing
in their presence.

14:03.977 --> 14:07.859
Some people are extremely fast, they will
walk fast

14:08.060 --> 14:14.285
and they will be handling things with such
a funny gestures

14:14.486 --> 14:18.060
that people will be frightened.

14:18.719 --> 14:21.517
You should not be such.

14:21.718 --> 14:29.718
What you have to do is to see that whatever
actions you take,

14:29.919 --> 14:34.049
you talk to them or do, do it in a gentle
way;

14:34.250 --> 14:39.611
that’s very important to be gentle and kind
to them.

14:39.812 --> 14:46.418
Also you’ll get people who will have bhuts,
who will have gurus on their heads,

14:46.619 --> 14:49.553
like the other day that lady was arguing
with Me.

14:49.754 --> 14:53.353
Try to convince [them] and tell if the -

14:53.554 --> 14:56.557
you know now who are real and who
are unreal.

14:56.758 --> 15:00.419
If you don’t know, ask your leader.

15:00.620 --> 15:08.208
You better tell them that, “This is not
going to help you, it has not helped you,

15:08.580 --> 15:13.200
so you have to give up.” And I’m sure
they’ll agree.

15:13.401 --> 15:15.676
I’m very sure they’ll agree.

15:15.877 --> 15:21.903
Because the way other day that Sindhi
lady, she was arguing with me.

15:22.104 --> 15:25.069
And she said that, “We get Vibhutis
[Sacred ash] in all centers.”

15:25.270 --> 15:29.619
I said: “This is all bhuta vidya, preta
vidya and smashana vidya.

15:29.820 --> 15:35.571
What do you get out of the vibhuti that
comes in, what is so great?”

15:35.772 --> 15:41.198
All these things are just to mislead you.

15:41.399 --> 15:49.199
So tell them firmly, but with full
attention,

15:49.400 --> 15:55.922
that you are trying to help them. If you
want to help them

15:56.123 --> 16:04.595
then you cannot afford to be rude to them
in no way.

16:08.689 --> 16:17.539
It is sometimes difficult to handle some
people who start arguing,

16:17.740 --> 16:25.655
so best is not to argue. Tell them:
“By argument we cannot convince you.

16:25.888 --> 16:29.932
It is not in the mind, it is beyond
the mind.”

16:30.133 --> 16:36.698
Up to a point it’s all right, after that
you should give up: “All right, I’m sorry.”

16:37.576 --> 16:45.693
Then your relationships in your family
should be good.

16:45.894 --> 16:51.110
You can’t have Sahaja Yoga if there is
no understanding

16:51.311 --> 16:55.625
between you, your wife, your children.

16:55.826 --> 17:01.151
We have to show that family is very
important in Sahaja Yoga,

17:01.352 --> 17:06.993
extremely important, and children are
even more important.

17:07.194 --> 17:10.850
You see how much we have done for
the children now,

17:11.051 --> 17:17.242
we have got schools, this, that, is a very
big responsibility.

17:17.443 --> 17:23.736
So we must understand what is
the responsibility.

17:23.937 --> 17:27.848
We should not spoil the children.

17:28.678 --> 17:32.920
We should appreciate whatever good they
are doing,

17:33.121 --> 17:36.044
whatever nice things they are doing.
But if they do anything wrong,

17:36.245 --> 17:41.651
you must tell them, “You are Sahaja Yogis
and you can't do like this.”

17:41.852 --> 17:46.889
That you have to tell them, whatever it is,
you have to tell them.

17:47.089 --> 17:51.202
If the children are very thin, then
understand they have got liver.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.067
So liver should be treated.

17:53.268 --> 17:55.734
And next time when you come to India

17:55.935 --> 18:00.766
we are going to get you all the medicines
of liver.

18:01.009 --> 18:04.782
If they are very fat, then they are
left-sided.

18:04.983 --> 18:11.051
Try to bring them to the centre with
the three candle treatment.

18:11.733 --> 18:14.847
But first of all, test it what is
the situation.

18:15.048 --> 18:19.832
Sometimes they develop a puffy fat, [that]
is all right, but they become all right.

18:20.033 --> 18:23.311
So that is how you should look after
their health.

18:23.512 --> 18:30.507
Then also look after their behaviour.
Tell them how to behave.

18:30.708 --> 18:35.209
As I have seen in the West the children
are not properly brought up

18:35.410 --> 18:39.326
because the parents neglect them, I won’t
blame the children.

18:39.527 --> 18:42.940
Parents neglect them. You should be
loving, kind -

18:43.141 --> 18:50.246
at the same time you must tell them what
is discipline is. It is very important.

18:50.446 --> 18:56.527
Then keep a-watch on them: How they are,
what they are doing.

18:56.728 --> 19:01.310
Of course, we have a school, but it has
limited seats there.

19:01.511 --> 19:08.428
Whatever it is, they are going to adjust
as many as possible.

19:08.629 --> 19:14.627
Even then supposing you have any problem,
don’t go arbitrarily into it.

19:14.828 --> 19:23.605
You may ask your leader or you may write
to Me and inform Me.

19:23.806 --> 19:27.619
Among you somebody might become very
ego-oriented,

19:27.820 --> 19:31.203
may start his own organisation, “I will
do this.”

19:31.404 --> 19:35.028
Let him say: “You get out” and he will
suffer.

19:35.229 --> 19:39.200
You do not have to worry. “All right, you
get out.”

19:39.401 --> 19:41.041
Anybody who is arbitrary will not work out.

19:41.242 --> 19:44.145
Supposing one finger starts acting more
than the rest –

19:44.346 --> 19:47.828
that means there is cancer, this is
malignancy.

19:48.029 --> 19:49.830
So we can’t have malignancy.

19:50.031 --> 19:54.816
All of you should work together with
understanding,

19:55.017 --> 20:01.929
before others as well as among yourselves.
It is very important to understand.

20:02.130 --> 20:05.243
Now, Sahaja Yoga has worked out in so
many countries.

20:05.444 --> 20:10.050
In such a big way in some, in such a small
way in some.

20:10.251 --> 20:17.725
But wherever it is, Sahaja Yogis have to be
something special.

20:17.926 --> 20:23.137
Even the children have to be something
special.

20:24.073 --> 20:27.271
You have any other problem which you do
not want to discuss,

20:27.472 --> 20:32.461
with, say, with your leader, then you can
write to Me directly, no harm.

20:32.662 --> 20:36.515
Either, if I answer well and good, if I do
not answer also well and good,

20:36.716 --> 20:39.853
it will work out.

20:41.283 --> 20:45.889
But attention should not be all the time
about yourself:

20:46.090 --> 20:50.626
me, my family, my children, my house,
my job, no.

20:50.827 --> 20:56.369
As soon as your attention is on other
people, it works out faster,

20:56.570 --> 21:00.695
it helps you very much. But on yourself:
“I am sick.

21:00.896 --> 21:05.497
I have this problem, that problem”,
nothing.

21:05.698 --> 21:10.633
You are now at a stage when you can
absolutely solve all the problems,

21:10.834 --> 21:14.476
but first and foremost thing: if your
attention is on yourself,

21:14.677 --> 21:19.249
it won’t work out. Attention should be
on others.

21:19.450 --> 21:23.169
And if it has to be on yourself, attention,

21:23.370 --> 21:28.481
then just find out: “What’s wrong with me?”

21:28.682 --> 21:33.088
But some people in that also go too far.
“Mother, my Agnya is catching.

21:33.289 --> 21:37.642
Mother, my this is catching…” [it] is
nothing, [it] is nonsense.

21:37.843 --> 21:42.882
Maybe you are catching from other people,
possible.

21:44.587 --> 21:47.266
There are some nice books, now already
in Sahaja Yoga

21:47.466 --> 21:55.415
translated in Chinese, luckily, and also
My tapes could be translated also.

21:55.616 --> 21:59.724
But you have to keep My voice, as I told
you,

21:59.925 --> 22:02.859
because that is mantra, isn’t it?

22:03.068 --> 22:07.571
And you can have subtitles, would be better
if you could do it.

22:07.772 --> 22:14.644
But it’s a very good idea that you can have
subtitles, really.

22:15.143 --> 22:20.202
Specially for Russians if they could do
in Russia.

22:20.403 --> 22:25.964
Now, [if] you have any questions, now you
can ask Me.

22:44.723 --> 22:48.031
So it should be always like, if you are
Chinese,

22:48.232 --> 22:53.037
then you should not only deal with Chinese.
They should all come to the collective.

22:53.204 --> 22:56.824
Supposing you are Indians, you should not
only deal with the Indians,

22:57.025 --> 22:58.867
but they should come to the collective.

22:59.068 --> 23:01.747
Because unless and until they come
to the collective

23:01.948 --> 23:04.275
[they] will not know what the problem is.

23:04.476 --> 23:07.482
It’s not that you can organise separately
a group,

23:07.683 --> 23:11.012
another group separately. It has to be
one group.

23:11.213 --> 23:16.448
Of course, you could have two ashrams
or three ashrams, makes no difference.

23:19.941 --> 23:22.720
Any other question?

23:22.921 --> 23:26.338
Yogi: Is the camphor treatment good for
left side? Shri Mataji: What?

23:26.539 --> 23:29.550
Yogi: Camphor … Yogi 2: Camphor treatment.

23:29.751 --> 23:32.795
Yogi 2: The camphor treatment. He is asking
if the camphor treatment

23:32.996 --> 23:36.181
is good for left side. Shri Mataji: What?
Yogi 2: The camphor.

23:36.382 --> 23:38.449
Shri Mataji: No no no no. No need.

23:38.650 --> 23:41.397
Camphor, only once in a while. Don’t do
camphor.

23:41.598 --> 23:46.320
But you have done all mixed up things,
you see, just do left-sided treatment,

23:46.536 --> 23:49.985
then you will be all right. Just mixed up.

23:50.186 --> 23:54.010
And you cannot earn money in the name
of God

23:54.211 --> 23:57.332
or Divine work, that’s one thing.

23:57.533 --> 24:00.239
You cannot organise like that. No, never.

24:00.470 --> 24:01.769
Because once you start getting it,

24:01.970 --> 24:04.380
left-sided bhuts will come into you.
Yogi: I’ve never done that.

24:04.581 --> 24:09.461
Shri Mataji: That is the part of Sahaja
Yoga. We cannot.

24:11.954 --> 24:15.884
Also if you have any guru’s photographs
and all that,

24:16.085 --> 24:19.353
it’s better to put them in the sea.

24:19.561 --> 24:26.143
Because this keeping any photograph,
any book about them creates problems.

24:26.344 --> 24:33.391
So religiously search it out and put them
in the sea.

24:33.592 --> 24:36.416
[Video interrupts brieftly]

24:36.876 --> 24:39.616
No no no no no no. No no no no. Don’t do
all that.

24:39.817 --> 24:44.554
They will work on the photograph. If you
want to help somebody, you see,

24:44.755 --> 24:49.897
some other people who have come, whom
you want to raise, don’t touch them.

24:50.098 --> 24:55.634
Take a bandhan yourself and give them
a bandhan.

24:55.835 --> 24:59.490
Put them before the photograph and you
just raise the Kundalini.

24:59.691 --> 25:08.547
But be careful. Because you are still,
you see, not that sort of thing

25:08.748 --> 25:12.566
that you cannot catch, you might catch.

25:12.767 --> 25:18.885
So among yourselves also you should not
do that. Don’t touch.

25:19.086 --> 25:21.673
If somebody says, “I have this problem”,
all right,

25:21.874 --> 25:26.187
put him on the photograph, take a bandhan
yourself,

25:26.388 --> 25:29.944
ask him to take a bandhan, you also give
a bandhan

25:30.105 --> 25:34.777
and then raise the Kundalini. Be careful.

25:38.647 --> 25:42.655
Even if there is somebody who has come
now who is a sick man.

25:42.856 --> 25:48.080
So you can give them a photograph, [it] is
all right, if they are willing to do it.

25:48.281 --> 25:54.941
But somebody in his family is willing
to take Sahaja Yoga,

25:55.142 --> 26:00.219
who is a healthy person, he should bring.
Otherwise don’t get after sick.

26:00.420 --> 26:04.199
You will have many sick, in thousands
to begin with.

26:04.400 --> 26:07.941
Don’t worry about sick.

26:08.983 --> 26:13.681
Or if they are sick tell them to take
the photograph

26:13.882 --> 26:17.869
and work it out, if they are left-sided
or right-sided.

26:18.070 --> 26:20.620
Then the faith grows, they improve.

26:20.821 --> 26:24.542
But you don’t touch the sick. No, no,
not at all.

26:24.743 --> 26:33.569
We are not here to cure the sick, but we
are here to give realisation.

26:38.151 --> 26:42.462
May God bless you.
Yogi: Shri Mataji, for technique,

26:42.663 --> 26:45.465
if you have a problem on one side, you have
imbalance

26:45.666 --> 26:50.510
and if the left side is weak or caught up,
do you raise the Kundalini

26:50.711 --> 26:53.867
on this side and give a bandhan
to the other side? Correct?

26:54.068 --> 26:56.705
Shri Mataji: Yes.

26:58.216 --> 27:03.837
Supposing you are right-sided,

27:04.077 --> 27:08.782
then you have to put down the right side,

27:09.583 --> 27:13.278
remember that way, it’s much better.

27:13.479 --> 27:17.217
So then you raise your left side and put
the right side down,

27:17.425 --> 27:19.602
if you have right-side problem.

27:19.803 --> 27:25.696
Now, if you have a left-side problem, so
you have to put down the left side.

27:25.897 --> 27:34.211
It’s easier to remember this way. So
there is no confusion.

27:39.449 --> 27:43.915
But tying up of Kundalini should be done
after you have moved out

27:44.116 --> 27:46.258
left to right or right to left, whichever
way.

27:46.459 --> 27:52.405
Then raise your Kundalini and tie up and
take a bandhan,

27:52.606 --> 27:55.553
it’s the best way.

28:03.792 --> 28:08.000
I would request you, all of you, to take
a photograph of yours

28:08.201 --> 28:15.085
and make an album, write it down below
that: what is your name,

28:15.286 --> 28:20.556
date of birth and of Self-realisation.

28:20.757 --> 28:25.695
Send it over to Me. Because I go on seeing
them sometimes, you see.

28:25.896 --> 28:30.791
So I’ll know you better and also I’ll have
My attention on you.

28:30.992 --> 28:36.509
Of the children as well as of bigger
people.

28:41.050 --> 28:43.496
So I’ll talk to you and talk to him

28:43.697 --> 28:46.775
because you have little individual
problems, both of you.

28:46.976 --> 28:51.172
What about you? Are you reconciled?

28:54.765 --> 28:59.915
I’m going to get, you see, this one,
Werner, to task.

29:00.116 --> 29:03.949
He came here to do Sahaja Yoga and not
to disturb a family.

29:04.150 --> 29:11.078
He’s been very wrong. I’m going to be
very angry with him.

29:13.146 --> 29:17.643
He is an old Sahaja Yogi, he should have
behaved himself.

29:17.844 --> 29:23.088
It’s not - never to disturb a family. You
have such sweet beautiful children.

29:23.289 --> 29:27.737
I will never support you in nonsense,
I must tell you.

29:27.938 --> 29:31.982
And your husband is a very good man. If you
behave all right

29:32.183 --> 29:36.265
he’ll come round to Sahaja Yoga, I’m sure.

29:36.466 --> 29:41.033
You cannot be a Sahaja Yogi if you have
no dharma,

29:41.234 --> 29:54.193
“shield” as Buddha has called it. It’s what
we call as your character.

29:54.394 --> 29:59.495
Your morality is the most important
in Sahaja Yoga.

29:59.696 --> 30:04.619
If you are not moral, it has no meaning
at all.

30:04.820 --> 30:10.185
What we need is morality today. This is
happening everywhere, nonsense.

30:10.386 --> 30:19.033
We have to imbibe it in ourselves and we
have to generate it for others also.

30:19.234 --> 30:22.457
Whole world is full of immoral people.

30:22.658 --> 30:27.941
A very, very few who are standing
for morality.

30:28.142 --> 30:34.781
That is the greatest ornament we have.

30:38.707 --> 30:46.422
All right? Don’t go astray. This will never
help you.

30:46.630 --> 30:52.033
It was very wrong of you and also for
your children.

30:52.234 --> 30:56.464
Now go back and behave yourself properly,

30:56.665 --> 31:00.735
otherwise you cannot be in Sahaja Yoga.

31:08.008 --> 31:13.730
Ha, if there was something wrong, then
it’s all right.

31:13.931 --> 31:17.608
We have divorce in Sahaja Yoga. We allow
people to divorce.

31:17.809 --> 31:22.528
But there should be substantial reason
for that.

31:30.000 --> 31:34.187
“Or to sub thik hai” [Is everything
all right?] What are we to do?

31:34.388 --> 31:36.707
That will do? All right.
Yogi: Thank You, Mother.

31:36.908 --> 31:39.747
Shri Mataji: May God Bless you all.

31:39.931 --> 31:44.222
I am sorry you had to come so late
in the night.

31:44.423 --> 31:46.670
Yogi: Mother, we have a small gift for You.

31:46.854 --> 31:50.686
Shri Mataji: Why, you’ve done so much!

31:53.441 --> 31:59.131
Oh. Where is the children’s this thing,
presents?

32:04.800 --> 32:10.579
My God, a small present, is it?
Yogi: It’s very small.

32:25.737 --> 32:28.954
Shri Mataji: All right, what is this?

32:29.155 --> 32:32.994
This is supposed to be small, is it?
From what angle?

32:33.195 --> 32:37.974
Yogi: It’s just a big box!
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.

32:44.862 --> 32:50.311
Ah. So now. What is that? Let’s see.

32:53.536 --> 32:56.750
My goodness.

32:58.973 --> 33:02.260
This is the one for what?
Yogis: Confucius.

33:02.461 --> 33:04.647
Yogis: Confucius. Guru.

33:04.848 --> 33:07.847
Shri Mataji: Confucius!

33:12.499 --> 33:20.638
He too has… you see?
Yogi: A stick.

33:23.863 --> 33:27.955
Shri Mataji: Fine, such an expensive one.

33:29.613 --> 33:34.915
Great. It’s very well done.

33:35.826 --> 33:40.006
Is it written here Confucius?
Yogi: Yes.

33:41.054 --> 33:47.149
Shri Mataji: All right. Thank you very
much.

33:47.698 --> 33:49.859
But you’ll have to bring it to India when
you come.

33:50.060 --> 33:52.997
[Yogi: “Yes, Shri Mataji”.]

33:56.071 --> 33:58.178
But such an expensive thing, you should not
have bought it.

33:58.379 --> 34:02.615
Yogi: Very good price, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Really?

34:02.816 --> 34:05.881
What is this? Yogi: This is Lao-Zi.
Yogi: Lao-Zi.

34:06.082 --> 34:09.273
Yogini: Lao-Tse. Yogi: Lao-Tse.
Shri Mataji: This is Lao-Tse?

34:09.474 --> 34:12.437
Nice!

34:45.720 --> 34:52.051
All right. He’s great I must say, Lao-Tse.

34:57.968 --> 35:03.921
Beautiful. He’s sitting on the clouds.

35:07.194 --> 35:09.710
Beautiful.

35:13.796 --> 35:17.984
[Yogini: “Wow”.] Good.

35:21.649 --> 35:27.111
This is His vahana. This is the one, is…
Yogi: Vehicle.

35:27.312 --> 35:29.219
Shri Mataji: Vahana, you know, this vahana
is …

35:29.420 --> 35:31.999
Yogi: Vehicle, isn’t it? Vehicle?
Shri Mataji: Conveyance.

35:32.230 --> 35:35.796
Yogi: Conveyance, yes.
Yogini: Conveyance, yes.

35:38.906 --> 35:44.074
Shri Mataji: Beautifully done. Thank you
very much, thank you.

35:44.275 --> 35:50.510
Is written here?
Yogi: This is Lao-Tse.

35:54.252 --> 35:57.243
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much.

36:00.809 --> 36:06.755
This shows the little boy is controlling.
(Unclear) This is what?

36:06.956 --> 36:11.358
[Inaudible comments – Yogini: “This is
a cloth, and yes, a...”.

36:11.559 --> 36:15.314
Yogi: “A Goddess”.
Yogini: “A Goddess…”.]

36:36.138 --> 36:38.513
Shri Mataji: Who is that?
Yogi: Is a Goddess.

36:38.727 --> 36:42.369
Yogi: Goddess. Goddess. She is from China.

36:42.570 --> 36:44.431
Shri Mataji: Goddess. Yogis and Yoginis:
From China. Yes. A Goddess.

36:44.632 --> 36:48.030
Shri Mataji: Saraswati.
[Indistinct comments]

36:48.231 --> 36:54.546
Shri Mataji: Ah, it looks like Saraswati.
Very Indian silk.

36:56.294 --> 36:59.225
Yogi: Yes, we had this picture when
Buddhism first came…

36:59.426 --> 37:02.026
Yogi: We had this kind of picture

37:02.227 --> 37:06.938
when Buddhism first came to China.
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.

37:07.139 --> 37:12.264
Buddhism didn’t talk of women.

37:15.864 --> 37:22.648
Beautiful, very beautiful. Thank you very
much, thank you. Beautiful.

37:25.371 --> 37:28.484
Very well done.

37:37.515 --> 37:42.720
These two books he gave Me, where are
they? All right.

37:42.921 --> 37:46.788
You can keep them – please keep it
somewhere.

37:46.989 --> 37:50.103
Now what is that?
Yogini: From Vietnam.

37:50.304 --> 37:52.122
Yogini: Yes, it’s from Vietnam.

37:52.323 --> 37:53.462
Yogi: From Vietnam.
Shri Mataji: From Vietnam?

37:53.663 --> 37:56.188
Yogi: Vietnam.
Yogini: Yes, from Malaysia collective.

37:56.389 --> 37:58.736
Shri Mataji: You are from Vietnam?
Yogini: Yes.

37:58.937 --> 38:02.126
Shri Mataji: Really?
Yogini: Yes.

38:06.593 --> 38:10.505
Shri Mataji: One place I’ve not been to
is Vietnam.

38:10.714 --> 38:15.958
But [to] Korea I’ve been - South Korea
I’ve been.

38:36.899 --> 38:38.678
[Yogini (not clearly audible): “Lacquer
and sewing”]

38:38.879 --> 38:44.667
Oh, they make these in Vietnam?
Yogini: Yes.

38:44.868 --> 38:48.560
Yogi: It’s a beautiful thing through sewing.
Shri Mataji: It’s beautiful.

38:48.761 --> 38:51.570
Is a painting?
Yogis: It’s a lacquer. Lacquer work.

38:51.771 --> 38:57.493
Shri Mataji: Lacquer work. Thank you
very much.

38:59.589 --> 39:06.663
So beautiful. Such a big lacquer work
I’ve never seen.

39:23.166 --> 39:29.046
Must be very expensive.
Yogini: We got it quite at a good price.

39:29.247 --> 39:35.049
Shri Mataji: Very beautiful. Thank you
very much.

39:35.627 --> 39:40.241
You want to take? Too close.

39:40.442 --> 39:44.298
[Yogi: “That’s we can take later.”]

39:46.174 --> 39:49.812
I’ll hold it.

40:04.901 --> 40:08.282
Very beautiful.

40:20.440 --> 40:23.600
Oh, thank you.

40:26.740 --> 40:31.968
All this has to come when you come
to Ganapatipule.

40:32.169 --> 40:35.759
Yogi: Actually, I would have loved one
Chinese to come this time.

40:35.960 --> 40:39.599
I’ll have to get lot more to carry all
these things.

40:39.800 --> 40:44.799
Shri Mataji: See, what I was saying,
for all the people from the East,

40:45.000 --> 40:48.562
there’s a concession they offer and it’s
much cheaper.

40:48.763 --> 40:54.885
I think what you can carry is quite a lot
but I don't know, they told Me...

40:55.086 --> 40:58.520
I don't know how much – quite a bit
[not clearly audible].

40:58.721 --> 41:02.650
So I think they can come, Chinese.

41:07.825 --> 41:14.321
At least Ganapatipule. I've no idea,
I'll ask them.

41:24.390 --> 41:31.458
Last time who went on the tour from here?
Complete tour - was a complete.

41:31.666 --> 41:40.289
Yogi: Well, I was on the 11th of December.
[Indistinct conversation follows]

41:50.099 --> 41:53.672
Shri Mataji: This is for children.

41:54.487 --> 42:00.744
Now. So we’ll have boys first, come along.

42:02.470 --> 42:08.449
May God bless you. Now you have to write
poems in this, all right?

42:10.223 --> 42:13.384
You move forward.

42:16.338 --> 42:22.107
Is there any other boy? Come along.

42:22.338 --> 42:30.847
You must write poems. Thank you.
Come along.

42:33.119 --> 42:40.047
You are a boy also! Kuber, come along.

42:50.395 --> 42:54.466
He’s done the pay week for Me.

42:55.661 --> 42:58.964
Now for the girls.

43:00.557 --> 43:05.907
He’s done a beautiful painting today,
you see?

43:29.318 --> 43:32.222
Did you do this one?
Child: Yes.

43:32.423 --> 43:37.234
Shri Mataji: Thank you. Good. Thank you.

43:39.066 --> 43:42.695
[Conversation aside with a yogi] Where is
that tea set we had bought? Did you get it?

43:42.896 --> 43:46.611
[Yogi: “Yes. Tea seats were at the back,
yes, two. There were two tea sets, Mother.

43:46.812 --> 43:49.727
I took the small one. The small one”.]

43:49.928 --> 43:55.320
Let it be now, you took only one so will
be a problem. All right.

43:55.543 --> 44:00.854
Who will get? I was thinking of dolls.
All right, for the girls.

44:01.055 --> 44:09.596
Now. You write poems. All right.
Come along.

44:13.702 --> 44:19.043
You want - which one you want? All right?

44:19.244 --> 44:23.580
Who else? All the girls.

44:27.731 --> 44:30.525
Ah.

44:36.908 --> 44:39.824
Yes, good.

44:46.933 --> 44:52.647
Very wise. Thank you.

45:01.932 --> 45:09.060
Just… [To another girl] Which one?
All right.

45:12.467 --> 45:15.366
[Aside to a girl] Did you get one?
Girl: No, it’s ok.

45:15.574 --> 45:17.638
Shri Mataji: Is it all right?
Girl: It’s all right.

45:17.839 --> 45:19.973
Shri Mataji: Very sweet.
Girl: They need it…

45:20.174 --> 45:23.864
Boy: They need it more than you.
Shri Mataji: Ah?

45:24.872 --> 45:32.907
We could give her that tea set, and all
that, so we have. Can you find that?

45:35.420 --> 45:39.394
Girl: Thank you, Mataji.
Shri Mataji: May God bless you.

45:58.848 --> 46:03.300
All right, come along, you are lucky.

46:03.501 --> 46:07.639
Quite heavy. May God bless you.
Girl: Thank you very much.

46:07.840 --> 46:12.294
Shri Mataji: Thank you, thank you.
Girl: Thank you.

46:13.487 --> 46:16.215
Shri Mataji: You got it, Rishi?
Sahaja Yogi: Such cool vibrations.

46:16.416 --> 46:21.002
[Unclear] [Indistinct conversation]

46:21.962 --> 46:25.456
Shri Mataji: All right, Soma is better now?
Yogi: Yes, it has improved…

46:25.657 --> 46:29.300
Shri Mataji: Better, yes.
Yogi: … since she came to Sahaja Yoga.

46:29.510 --> 46:33.162
Girl: Thank you very much, Shri Mataji.

46:33.363 --> 46:36.320
Shri Mataji: Next time I would like to see
your poems.

46:36.521 --> 46:42.524
All right? Kuber, you too.

46:43.691 --> 46:50.563
And also nice drawings. Where is
the drawing gone of Kuber?

46:50.772 --> 46:55.404
This I want to take with Me.
It’s refreshing.

46:58.853 --> 47:03.051
All right. May God bless you. May God
bless you.

47:03.252 --> 47:08.176
Look after yourself. And know that you are
Sahaja Yogis,

47:08.377 --> 47:13.209
is a very big position, you are saints.
Special people.

47:13.410 --> 47:16.479
You are the foundation.

47:16.680 --> 47:22.837
Anyway I may go to mainland China and
talk to the…

47:24.832 --> 47:32.363
Let’s see if Prime Minister listens to Me.
May be.

47:32.564 --> 47:35.604
May God bless you.

47:38.859 --> 47:43.621
Yogis: Thank you, Mother.
Shri Mataji: It’s all right.

47:43.822 --> 47:46.040
Yogi: Thank You Mother, for coming
to Hong Kong…

47:46.241 --> 47:50.428
Shri Mataji: Wah-wah.
Yogi: …and blessing us all.

47:55.153 --> 47:57.655
Shri Mataji: You just wait and - you just
wait. [Yogi: “OK”.]

47:57.856 --> 48:01.468
Then I will go and talk to him.

48:01.669 --> 48:04.708
May God bless you.

48:07.826 --> 48:13.321
And I think people are very simple, very
simple people in North Korea.

48:13.522 --> 48:16.000
You are South-Korean? Yogini: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Ah, I went to South Korea,

48:16.201 --> 48:20.630
I’m sorry, not North, South Korea.

48:20.831 --> 48:27.431
But you see, still they have no idea
of a spiritual life. No idea.

48:27.632 --> 48:31.329
So, you go there quite often?
Yogini: Yes, tomorrow I’ll go there.

48:31.530 --> 48:33.145
Shri Mataji: She goes to… She goes…

48:33.346 --> 48:35.422
Yogini 2: She is my sister who came here
today.

48:35.623 --> 48:39.843
Shri Mataji: So start talking about Sahaja
Yoga. All right?

48:40.044 --> 48:46.886
Yogini: Yes. It’s the first time…
Shri Mataji: No, no, you can do it.

48:47.087 --> 48:51.087
So have programme, or something. And get
more people here

48:51.288 --> 48:59.371
from South Korea. And send them over.
You can do very well.

48:59.572 --> 49:02.758
Too much American influence.
[Yogini: “Right”.]

49:02.959 --> 49:11.952
That’s the problem. And also then I saw
one programme

49:12.153 --> 49:16.005
they had invited us to, supposed to be
a very special one.

49:16.206 --> 49:22.579
And we were sitting on the top from
the galleries, you see, for VIPs

49:22.780 --> 49:26.748
and downstairs, and I’ve never seen
such a show.

49:26.956 --> 49:31.908
Very dirty show they showed. Very dirty.

49:32.109 --> 49:35.470
I’ve never seen. And CP was wearing his
glasses and he just closed his eyes,

49:35.671 --> 49:38.497
and I had to, said it, “Close your eyes,
you can’t bear it”.

49:38.706 --> 49:44.303
And both of us vomited. Leave show.

49:44.504 --> 49:48.571
I’ve never seen such a dirt anywhere.

49:49.146 --> 49:52.314
You know, I mean, can’t imagine how
they have

49:52.515 --> 49:57.594
taken these things from these stupid
Americans.

49:58.963 --> 50:02.070
You can work it out, all right?
May God bless you.

50:02.271 --> 50:06.082
Yoginis: Thank You, Mother.

50:06.283 --> 50:09.991
Shri Mataji: We have to think of our
countries, we have to save them.

50:10.192 --> 50:17.029
Don’t you think so? It’s very important,
to save your own country.

50:17.230 --> 50:23.689
Just I give you all the powers.
May God bless you.

50:23.890 --> 50:27.041
First grow in Sahaja Yoga, first grow
in Sahaja Yoga,

50:27.242 --> 50:29.437
these people can also come sometimes.

50:29.638 --> 50:35.422
We can send some other people. We could
have programmes. All right?

50:35.623 --> 50:37.142
May God bless you. Yogini: Are You going
to come to Korea again?

50:37.343 --> 50:40.206
Yogini: Are You going
to come to Korea again, another time?

50:40.414 --> 50:42.539
Yogi: She is asking if You are you going
to come to Korea.

50:42.740 --> 50:48.400
Shri Mataji: Anyone at this time - I’m
so busy now, I don’t know.

50:48.601 --> 50:54.053
Keeping Me too busy. That’s all right,
I think it will work out.

50:54.254 --> 50:57.496
These people can go and work it out.
All right?

50:57.743 --> 51:01.454
Yogini: Thank you. /Shri Mataji: May God
bless you. /Yogini: Thank you.

51:01.655 --> 51:04.634
Shri Mataji: So, are you feeling better
now, with him?

51:04.835 --> 51:07.095
You have Ekadasha, you know?
Yogini: Yes, I know.

51:07.296 --> 51:11.252
Shri Mataji: Ekadasha means beginning
of cancer, do you know?

51:11.453 --> 51:16.190
Don’t struggle anymore. You know,
no mother can live without children.

51:16.390 --> 51:22.088
See, all this is a temporary sort
of infatuation, finished, is this.

51:22.290 --> 51:24.330
Mother is a mother.

51:24.531 --> 51:29.366
How she stands, you know, for her children.
All right? That’s more important.
