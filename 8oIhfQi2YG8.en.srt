1
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:13,320
So welcome to you all, Sahaja Yogis,

2
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,720
to this great country of yoga.

3
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:33,640
Today first of all we have to establish

4
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:40,880
our desire within ourselves

5
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,640
that we are seekers

6
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:50,920
and that we have to achieve our full growth and maturity.

7
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,840
Today's puja is for the whole universe.

8
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,520
The whole universe

9
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,400
should be enlightened with your desires.

10
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,680
Your desires should be so intense

11
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,120
that they should emit out

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,800
the pure vibrations of Mahakali Shakti,

13
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,920
which is the pure desire

14
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,440
of attaining the spirit.

15
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,040
That's the real desire.

16
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:42,400
All the other desires are like mirage.

17
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:54,360
You are the people who are chosen by God.

18
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:04,480
Specially, first to express your desire,

19
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,440
and then to achieve it.

20
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:20,080
And by intense desire of purity

21
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,880
you have to purify the whole world.

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,120
Not only the seekers,

23
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,480
but even those who are not seekers.

24
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:44,200
You have to create an aura around this universe,

25
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:52,200
of desire to achieve the ultimate,

26
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,720
the spirit.

27
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:03,160
I think you have to value much more of your attention

28
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,720
many more things within Myself,

29
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,320
because everything is in My attention.

30
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,320
But you try to purify your desires,

31
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,440
away from the worldly problems that are facing you.

32
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,400
So you expand it more, then you start thinking:

33
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:38,680
'Mother, what about the problem of our country?'

34
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,680
All right, give Me the map of your country - finished.

35
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,400
That's more than sufficient.

36
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,040
Then purify yourself.

37
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,200
The desire that you have, you leave it.

38
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,880
And once you are purified

39
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,040
that area will be covered through your attention,

40
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,040
it's very interesting.

41
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:17,840
When you get over it then only you can throw light,

42
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,160
but if you are inside you are hidden by that.

43
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,760
Your light is hidden, there's no light emitted.

44
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,640
You all rise above that desire.

45
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,720
Every time you get a desire you rise above it,

46
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,560
so your light is emitted on that wider problem

47
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,480
that you are facing

48
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,920
which you think should be solved by Me.

49
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,840
These are all My headaches which you are taking on yourself.

50
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,200
You have to do only one thing is to become the spirit

51
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,840
that's all. Is a simple thing.

52
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,400
The rest of it is My headache.

53
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:07,760
Now the problems

54
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:14,880
that should take your desire on the collective

55
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:22,680
should be very different.

56
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,560
To substantiate your purity,

57
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,840
to be fragrant with your purity,

58
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,200
your attention should be on the other side.

59
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,000
Now you are not facing Me,

60
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,240
you are sitting with Me facing the whole world.

61
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:46,640
See, the whole attitude will change.

62
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:52,080
The attitude should be: 'What can I give?

63
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,520
How can I give?

64
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,880
What is my mistake in giving?

65
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,520
I have to be more alert.

66
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,960
Where is my attention?

67
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,440
I have to be more alert towards myself

68
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,800
what am I doing?

69
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,960
What's my responsibility?'

70
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,920
You must desire that you should be pure.

71
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,160
You should be pure desire.

72
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,040
That means you should be the spirit.

73
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,080
That, "What is your responsibility to yourself?"

74
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,320
You should desire that your responsibility to yourself

75
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,120
should be manifested,

76
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,680
should be complete.

77
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:58,480
Then your responsibility to this Sahaja Yoga.

78
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,480
What is your responsibility to Sahaja Yoga,

79
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,080
which is the work of God,

80
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:11,600
which has started and you are My hands.

81
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,440
You have to do the work of God,

82
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,920
and you have to fight the anti-God elements,

83
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,440
the satanic elements.

84
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,080
You are not responsible for your family any more,

85
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,800
those who are, are half-baked Sahaja Yogis

86
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,560
I said, are useless absolutely good for nothing.

87
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,400
All such will drop out, their families will suffer,

88
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,080
I know this is going to happen.

89
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,560
Because now the forces are gathering in such a way

90
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,320
that sorting out will start.

91
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,800
Your responsibility to yourself, to be the spirit,

92
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:58,080
your responsibility to Sahaja Yoga,

93
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,200
your responsibility to understand Me,

94
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,840
better and better and better.

95
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,960
Your responsibility to understand this mechanism

96
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,040
that is within you,

97
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,240
your responsibility to understand how this mechanism

98
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,920
works out everything.

99
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:28,880
The responsibility is to how to become a guru yourself.

100
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,400
Your responsibility to be a dignified and a glorified personality.

101
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,200
A responsibility to be a respectable person

102
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:43,080
and not a cheap personality.

103
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,160
Every one of you

104
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:53,440
is worth the whole universe.

105
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,640
If you want to rise to that height.

106
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:07,360
Universes of universes can be thrown away at your feet.

107
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,400
If you want to rise to that height,

108
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,960
to that magnitude that is within you to prosper.

109
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,880
Thus today, we have to start this puja,

110
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,760
on Mahakali Day.

111
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,240
And it's the Day of the Gauri we can say,

112
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,400
and Ganesh-Gauri's Day today,

113
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:38,000
though according to the schedule time it may not be.

114
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,920
But according to Me,

115
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,520
let us establish within ourself on a subtler level

116
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:50,400
the desire to be pure,

117
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,760
and to be cleansed out.

118
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:05,120
All the barriers and unclean things that are within us,

119
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,360
to desire to be great Sahaja Yogis,

120
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:17,080
desire to be responsible Sahaja Yogis

121
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,040
and desire to be surrendered to your Mother.

122
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,160
It's not difficult.

123
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,280
That is the easiest, the last one is the easiest,

124
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,360
because what you surrender,

125
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,440
I don't want anything from you,

126
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,640
except that you accept My Love.

127
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,600
Surrendering just means you open your heart to accept My Love.

128
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,600
Give up this ego.

129
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,880
That's all and it will work out.

130
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,240
I'm sure it's going to work out.

131
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,680
I am trying to push Myself into your hearts

132
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,760
and I'll definitely settle down there.

133
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,800
May God bless you for today's puja,

134
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,560
I hope all of you will take it in such a way

135
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,200
that the subtlest of subtle

136
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,840
will be awakened within you, the sensitivity

137
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,960
every way, and the Love,

138
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,240
which culminates into joy.

139
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:24,680
Love that flowers into the fragrance of joy

140
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,960
will manifest in today's puja.

141
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,840
May God bless you!

142
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,280
than Me, because I can manage,
