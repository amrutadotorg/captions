1
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:45,499
You must have felt the vibrations of this
place; they are tremendous. And that we should

2
00:01:45,499 --> 00:01:52,499
come here after so many years is really very
much surprising. This place has a great connection

3
00:01:53,170 --> 00:02:00,170
with Me as such because My forefathers ruled
in this place, and this was the capital of

4
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:18,930
Shalivanas called as Pratishthan, and then
they made it easier as Paithan. They were

5
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:27,079
the rulers here for thousands of years. And
they are the ones who started this Shalivahan

6
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:34,079
Dynasty, actually they called themselves as
Sath Vahan, means seven vahanas. They represented

7
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:44,129
the seven vahanas of the seven chakras. It's
surprising how it is so Sahaj. After that

8
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:55,370
there was a great poet, as you know about
him, Gyaneshwara, who came here. He was born

9
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:02,510
very close to this place, who was here for
quite some time. And there was one fellow

10
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:13,299
who was a very supraconscious person who challenged
him. His name was Changdev. So he said that

11
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:22,769
“What do you have with you to show that
you have got God with you?” And there was

12
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,879
a male buffalo with him, male buffalo, which
was just walking on the road, and Gyaneshwara

13
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:47,500
made that buffalo say Veda Mantras. And this
Changdev try to show some tricks. Gyaneshwara,

14
00:03:53,650 --> 00:04:00,650
with his brothers and sister, was sitting
on a broken wall and he made the wall move

15
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
with all of them in the air. And then he realized,
Chandev, that this is some sort of an incarnation

16
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:15,650
on this earth.

17
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:22,650
Apart from that, there's another great poet
called Eknath who has written lots of folk

18
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:31,340
songs, like Namadeva, describing Sahaja Yoga.
So this place had some sort of attractive

19
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:46,370
focus of vibrations for all these great saints
to come and settle down. They've excavated

20
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,800
lots of old things about this place and the
sari that is given to the Goddess here is

21
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:07,250
made in this place, called as Paithani. It
started in the time of Shalivana and that

22
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:13,419
art is still there. That's the only sari in
which they use real gold as the thread, real

23
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:20,240
gold. Just for the Goddess.

24
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:27,240
So this place is still very vibrating, is
out of the way for the people to come down,

25
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:36,180
thank God, so it still maintains its own vibration,
its goodness and its purity. And you are all

26
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:45,210
very lucky people in this group to have come
to this place and to have visited this. As

27
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:52,210
you will go round you will see there is a
beautiful garden next to it. The river Godawari

28
00:05:54,139 --> 00:06:01,139
is called as the Ganga, the Ganges of the
South. It starts from Nasik where you were

29
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:08,349
before, and then brought here and a big dam
is made for the supply of water all over which

30
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:15,680
you can see on your way. There is a beautiful
garden nearby and Eknath's temple is just

31
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:22,680
behind here. So we can all go and have a look
at it also.

32
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:33,760
I am happy you went and saw Ajanta caves.
Should show you how people were dedicated,

33
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,669
to build all that in ten centuries. They had
not seen Buddha at all; Buddha never came

34
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:49,669
to the south of India. Just believing in Buddha
what work they did, what sacrifices, how they

35
00:06:53,830 --> 00:07:00,830
built it. They had to go through very difficult
times because there was no water, there was

36
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:08,860
no communication, nothing. And they used the
stones, you must have seen there, of different

37
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:14,719
colors and different hues which are created
by Mother Earth. And when you break them,

38
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:21,719
inside those egg-like stones you get beautiful,
semi-precious stones. They dissolved them

39
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:32,370
into some sort of an indigenous solvent and
used it for painting. And that's how the paintings

40
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:38,070
are today surviving. You can't see without
lights, so how they must have painted it at

41
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:44,580
that time? What sort of eyes they must be
having? Their dedication gave them this power

42
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:51,580
that they could build it. They carried on
for ten centuries this work.

43
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:58,690
If Sahaja Yoga can be carried for ten centuries,
this world would be a different place. So

44
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:05,690
one has to learn that we have to dedicate.
We must fully dedicate ourselves. We are not

45
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:15,159
here to gain everything out of Sahaja Yoga.
Like in the beginning, people have problems

46
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:19,990
about their families, so they think that God
should solve the problem because they have

47
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:23,539
come to Sahaja Yoga to oblige Sahaja Yoga
now, so God must solve their problems. Now

48
00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:29,440
they have problems of their jobs, God must
solve the problem. If they have problems with

49
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:35,169
their relations, so God must solve their problems.
That's the sort of a job given to God because

50
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:40,479
they have very graciously joined Sahaja Yoga.
Then, after that, God must give them money.

51
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:47,110
He must provide them for everything. And He
must look after them. For no commitment at

52
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,000
all, there is no commitment. Nobody has any
commitment in Sahaja Yoga. But God is committed,

53
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and God has to work it out. Then they start,
some people, foolishly start using Sahaja

54
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:05,050
Yoga for other purposes, like earning money
or earning power, or name, or fame, or domination

55
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,860
or anything.

56
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:14,860
These are the steps which are going down,
not upwards. And then, once you go down you

57
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:25,950
don't realize whether you are going upward
or downward. So in dedication one has to see:

58
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:32,220
what have I dedicated for Sahaja Yoga? All
the time I have problems. All the time I say

59
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,029
I can't do this because of that, I can't do
that because of this, there’s the problem,

60
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:41,610
this I would like to do, this I would like
to do. All the time there’s an I, I, I and

61
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:48,610
I, but what have I dedicated? What time have
I given to Sahaja Yoga? How much money have

62
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:56,490
I given to Sahaja Yoga? Nothing at all. People
don't even take leave for Sahaja Yoga. They

63
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:03,480
can't do anything for Sahaja Yoga. These people
not only took leave, but permanently went

64
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:09,019
and settled in that place, in that far-fetched
place. Without any machinery, without anything

65
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:16,019
they did that whole painting and the whole
excavation and all that, what you call the

66
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:25,110
entire work of such a tremendous volume that
is impossible in these modern times. Nobody

67
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:32,249
can recreate something like that - with all
your machinery, with everything - because

68
00:10:32,249 --> 00:10:33,660
people don't have dedication.

69
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:40,660
So for Sahaja Yoga we have to put ourselves
onto a point: What did I do? What did I sacrifice

70
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:47,550
for Sahaja Yoga? Nothing. It's only for my
own child or maybe for my wife, or for myself,

71
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:54,550
or for my job or for something. What is our
commitment? And without commitment, purity

72
00:10:56,709 --> 00:11:03,709
cannot come in. You will go up and down like
a yo-yo. We are committed to Sahaja Yoga.

73
00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:15,069
If there are even five people who are really
fully committed to Sahaja Yoga it can be built

74
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:24,970
up that way. But the problem is everybody
shares with each other this kind of non-committal

75
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:36,389
behavior. And that’s something not good.
Committed means even if we have to give our

76
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:44,879
life we should do it. Even if we have to give
up everything, we should do it. But all other

77
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:53,809
considerations are to be taken there, everything
should work out. So all should be joy all

78
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:58,790
the time, you must get your jobs, you must
get your wives, you must get your everything,

79
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:05,790
children properly done, everything to be done
by Sahaja Yoga. And when this commitment will

80
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:15,990
start I am sure Sahaja Yoga will spread like
anything. Even falsehood, when people are

81
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:23,110
committed, like you see in all other religions,
every religion they did that. And how much

82
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:30,110
it has spread. Of course, Sahaja Yoga is blessings,
is blissful. It blesses you all the time.

83
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:36,170
It gives you a very long rope to hang you
also sometimes. One must know that it’s

84
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,170
a blessing of that kind also.

85
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:46,110
So one has to be very, very alert that God
has chosen us for such a special work and

86
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:53,110
we have to be fully committed to Sahaja Yoga.
All those who are wise will take to this and

87
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:02,709
understand that the life is only worth this,
otherwise it's useless. It's good for nothing.

88
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:09,709
It has no meaning. And this has to come from,
first from the leaders and then from others.

89
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:25,170
Complete commitment to Sahaja Yoga. It doesn't
mean that you have to give up anything. For

90
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,999
My sake you don't have to do anything. But
for your own sake, for your own betterment

91
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:40,999
you have to do it. I hope next time when you
come to India you will be coming better prepared

92
00:13:44,869 --> 00:13:51,869
for commitments. It's not only money, it's
not only your talking about, your saying about

93
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:59,269
it, writing about it, but it is through your
own being it should happen. You all should

94
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:06,319
become the source of energy that I want to
emit all over the world. That light which

95
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:14,779
is going to enlighten. No amount of artificiality
is going to work it out, but complete genuineness

96
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:15,670
within you.

97
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:19,600
Look at these saints, they had nobody, they
didn't have Mother to help them. This Gyaneshwara's

98
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:26,600
life if you read you will be shocked. He didn't
have even shoes to walk. He was treated so

99
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:34,529
badly because his father was a sanyasi and
was married so they said that these are the

100
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:40,129
children of a sanyasi. They had no food to
eat. They had to walk for miles together bare

101
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:46,360
feet, they had no blessings of the Mother
on them. Despite that they kept to Sahaja

102
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:53,360
Yog, kept to their blessings of being one
with God. Because they achieved that state.

103
00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:05,459
Now all this is for your good, for your benevolence
that you get all the blessings. But that doesn't

104
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:16,689
mean that you should stagnate, that you should
not progress. One has to progress higher and

105
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:23,920
higher. One has to decide the commitment.
I am committed to Sahaja Yoga. And that is

106
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:30,660
what you have to be, committed.

107
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:37,660
May God bless you all.

108
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:44,129
Today we’ll – being the first puja we
wont have a long puja, we’ll have Ganesha’s

109
00:15:44,129 --> 00:15:51,129
Atharva Sheersha then maybe hundred and eight
names could be said. It’s not going to be

110
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:05,550
very long puja, and I think then you have
to also go to Veru to see … (Marathi or

111
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:34,529
Hindi)… I think you can go tomorrow to Veru.
See, it takes hardly about two hours or three

112
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:44,420
hours. Two hours at the most. And then you
can go to Shrirampur.

113
00:16:57,139 --> 00:17:01,369
You have to be ready tomorrow quite early
in the morning. Go and see Veru, which is

114
00:17:01,369 --> 00:17:06,270
about two hours’ journey from here, and
then you can go to Shrirampur where you can

115
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:13,270
have your lunch, rest there, in the evening
there’s program for you. I hope you enjoyed

116
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:21,120
your visit to Ajanta. I was waiting for you
here, then I had to leave because you were

117
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:28,260
very much delayed; and I am sorry for what
has happened in Malavathi, that there was

118
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:35,260
some inconveniences because I was not there.
Just imagine, if I am not in a place how things

119
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,400
go wrong! I mean, I just start wondering what
will happen when I will not be there.

120
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,830
So the commitment has to be there. That’s
the main point is.

121
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,650
…. I was thinking that you need not come
today to Aurangabad, because it’s quite

122
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:44,440
far away and then you have to go tomorrow
to Veru; so this is the place where they have

123
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:51,440
arranged everything for you, so it’s better
that you stay here, there’s a beautiful

124
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:09,900
garden. You can have a look at the garden,
then have your food here and rest, and tomorrow

125
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,370
morning early in the morning if you can leave
then you can see Veru also and I’ll look

126
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:17,620
after the Aurangabad program, all right?
