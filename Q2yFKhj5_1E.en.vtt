00:00:03.396 --> 00:00:09.908
Now. (Hindi aside)

00:00:12.251 --> 00:00:15.592
So. Now to, you see, to influence other
people we must know

00:00:15.793 --> 00:00:20.276
how much control we have upon ourselves
also; that’s very important.

00:00:20.477 --> 00:00:27.039
For example, some people, you see,
have no proper image

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.465
and they try to influence others, so it’s
a mockery.

00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:38.693
Nobody gets influenced by such a person
who himself has no image of his own.

00:00:39.036 --> 00:00:44.005
So, before working out the exterior,
interior must be worked out.

00:00:44.206 --> 00:00:48.248
For example, a person who always comes
late to the office,

00:00:48.434 --> 00:00:55.852
and is always delayed and has no
time-sense, is never respected.

00:00:56.557 --> 00:00:58.958
So when you tell people that “you should
be in time”,

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:01.309
you should be the first to arrive
at the time, right time.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.391
You must always keep the time, absolutely,

00:01:04.592 --> 00:01:07.819
you should be known person for keeping
time.

00:01:07.978 --> 00:01:12.185
Say, supposing you have to go to the office
at say ten o’clock,

00:01:12.386 --> 00:01:17.443
you reach office in such a way that you are
there five minutes, wait outside

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:22.774
and enter the office exactly at the time
when you have to go.

00:01:23.737 --> 00:01:27.400
That punctuality is very important. That
helps people,

00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:30.943
and people get an awe about you because
they think that

00:01:31.144 --> 00:01:36.615
“This gentleman is so regular and I’m
the one who is absolutely late”.

00:01:37.577 --> 00:01:41.668
Also, if you tell somebody that I have
to meet at such and such a time,

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.237
and should be arranged at such and such
a time,

00:01:46.438 --> 00:01:48.859
then you should be absolutely punctual.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:56.422
That is very important, that the punctuality
is to be maintained by you.

00:01:56.623 --> 00:02:05.248
Now, I’ve seen in the West specially that
people get up very late

00:02:05.411 --> 00:02:09.147
and they are very lazy. They walk
in a limpy manner;

00:02:09.348 --> 00:02:13.905
and the whole thing shows that, you see,
they are not interested in the world.

00:02:14.106 --> 00:02:17.743
They are just pushed into it; somehow
or other they are doing it.

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:21.946
Such a person can never influence anyone,
because people also see your image,

00:02:22.154 --> 00:02:24.918
that you yourself you are dragging your
life somehow;

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:30.070
so why to do the same thing, whatever he is
doing he cannot tell us anything.

00:02:30.271 --> 00:02:33.774
So that’s another reason you cannot
influence people at all,

00:02:33.974 --> 00:02:37.533
if you are yourself a lazy person.

00:02:37.734 --> 00:02:42.831
So the person who has to influence others
has to be early riser,

00:02:43.032 --> 00:02:45.455
he must have proper habits of sleeping,

00:02:45.625 --> 00:02:50.185
he must get up in the morning and be
properly brushed, washed and everything,

00:02:50.385 --> 00:02:54.636
and should be what we call a smart man.

00:02:55.258 --> 00:03:02.822
Now many people believe that if you try
to be very sort of a

00:03:03.023 --> 00:03:08.705
person of a fashionable type, I mean that
you wear dresses

00:03:08.906 --> 00:03:13.059
of fashionable style and all that – that
will influence others, it’s not true.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.310
Because they think you have no conviction
of any kind, you see,

00:03:17.511 --> 00:03:22.365
so you must build up an image of yourself
that you are such and such.

00:03:22.566 --> 00:03:26.935
You see, a kind of a character, as we have
in a drama; it’s a character.

00:03:27.135 --> 00:03:32.232
The person speaks with the same character,
he talks with the same character.

00:03:32.433 --> 00:03:38.384
And the style should be absolutely known
to people, that this is your style,

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:46.563
that’s how you are, that you do not sort
of compromise on things.

00:03:49.068 --> 00:03:54.266
That is very important that when you are
talking to people you must have

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:59.205
a proper style of talking; walking - proper
style.

00:03:59.385 --> 00:04:01.821
This should be all trimmed down properly,

00:04:02.022 --> 00:04:05.347
that you don’t walk in a languid manner,
you see,

00:04:05.548 --> 00:04:08.627
in a manner where (you are) throwing your
legs here and there, walking like that,

00:04:08.828 --> 00:04:12.004
but straight, and sit down straight.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.644
And let people see that you have faith
in yourself, first of all.

00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:19.400
If you do not have faith in yourself;
I mean, your any behaviour

00:04:19.601 --> 00:04:23.270
shows that you have no faith in yourself,
you cannot influence others.

00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:31.523
So your self-confidence must be shown
through your all behavioural programming,

00:04:31.724 --> 00:04:38.332
like talking, sitting, walking,
communicating,

00:04:38.533 --> 00:04:42.360
there should be a thing with confidence.

00:04:42.655 --> 00:04:48.813
But the confidence comes in a person when
he realises that he is completely secured.

00:04:49.014 --> 00:04:52.884
And in Sahaja Yoga, as you know, that
if your centre heart is secured…

00:04:53.085 --> 00:04:55.765
if you know, tell yourself that, “Mother is
with me.

00:04:55.966 --> 00:04:59.177
Mother is helping me, and I’m with Mother.

00:04:59.378 --> 00:05:02.008
I’ve nothing to worry”. Then your centre
heart will be alright.

00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:06.061
Of course, this you cannot tell to others,
but still if you have a personality,

00:05:06.262 --> 00:05:10.026
you can imbibe that into others very
simply.

00:05:10.227 --> 00:05:13.697
But if you are diffident about yourself
then you cannot do it.

00:05:13.898 --> 00:05:18.923
So confidence is to be established, first
of all, within yourself.

00:05:19.124 --> 00:05:21.769
For Sahaja Yogis is very easy to say,
“I’m the Spirit,

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.063
and I’m the child, I’m the one who has been
chosen by the Adi Shakti Herself.”

00:05:27.264 --> 00:05:34.161
So there should be tremendous amount
of confidence in you.

00:05:37.074 --> 00:05:44.751
Now. Say, for example, when you are, say,
with the people, how do you eat your food?

00:05:44.952 --> 00:05:47.334
Some people, you see, open their mouth
all the time;

00:05:47.535 --> 00:05:52.168
eat their food with a sort of a sound and
all that. All these things

00:05:52.369 --> 00:05:55.705
are watched by others; how you eat,
how you talk.

00:05:55.906 --> 00:06:00.681
And also, normally, you should not keep
your mouth open.

00:06:00.882 --> 00:06:03.704
You can never influence people. But keep
your – not pursed either,

00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:09.140
but in a normal way – closed, like that,
so that people do not think

00:06:09.341 --> 00:06:14.039
that you are just gaping at them, or if
you keep your mouth open all the time.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.813
Or they should not think also that you are
aggressive with them or angry with them,

00:06:19.014 --> 00:06:24.266
but a normal face, a – what you call –

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:31.343
a face that is neither aggressive, nor which
is subservient. So it won’t give -

00:06:31.544 --> 00:06:34.311
supposing you keep a gaping mouth, they’ll
think, “He is an idiot”.

00:06:34.512 --> 00:06:38.228
And if you keep pursed your lips they
will think

00:06:38.429 --> 00:06:44.417
that you are a person of aggressive nature.

00:06:44.618 --> 00:06:51.165
So one has to understand how you are
sitting before others, talking to others.

00:06:51.366 --> 00:06:56.231
And to influence others, first of all, as I
said, you must respect your own personality,

00:06:56.432 --> 00:07:00.433
and then respect the personality of others
in your behaviour.

00:07:00.634 --> 00:07:03.877
Like, you see, when somebody comes in,

00:07:04.078 --> 00:07:06.995
you should talk to them in a very gentle
manner –

00:07:07.203 --> 00:07:09.357
knowing that this is another God who is
coming in.

00:07:09.558 --> 00:07:12.153
"If there’s Spirit in me, is Spirit in him
also."

00:07:12.354 --> 00:07:17.387
So you must see that he sits properly,
he is comfortable,

00:07:17.588 --> 00:07:24.829
and ask to - if he wants any tea or
anything. Make him comfortable.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:31.546
Let him feel that you are not in any way
disturbed, nor that you are irritated,

00:07:31.747 --> 00:07:38.279
but you are very happy to meet him and that
you should settle down with kindness.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:44.039
Sometimes also in diffidence one might feel
nervous about a person if he is there.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.399
That nervousness is a sign of insecurity.
One should not be nervous.

00:07:48.615 --> 00:07:53.888
If you are talking to someone, one should
be in a way that

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:57.967
another person should feel absolutely
confident

00:07:58.168 --> 00:08:02.213
and should feel that "This gentleman is
going to listen to me."

00:08:02.414 --> 00:08:06.904
Now the another way to impress people is:
allow others to talk.

00:08:07.105 --> 00:08:11.519
Listen to them properly; not talk yourself,
listen to them.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.976
And once they have said something, then
say, “That’s true, no doubt.

00:08:15.177 --> 00:08:18.139
I agree, but…” Then you can start.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:23.024
So you do not just stun them by your,
“No! Not at all!”, like that.

00:08:23.225 --> 00:08:25.773
But on the contrary, you see what they say.

00:08:25.974 --> 00:08:28.261
I mean, you can watch Me, I do that
many-a-times.

00:08:28.462 --> 00:08:31.695
When somebody says, “Oh, true, it’s true,
but, you see, this is it.”

00:08:31.896 --> 00:08:35.097
So they don’t mind. They think that you
have seen the other side of the thing also.

00:08:35.298 --> 00:08:40.961
That you have a balance and you just don’t
impress your ideas on the other.

00:08:41.328 --> 00:08:47.188
In a way you are, but in a way you do it
that nobody feels that impact,

00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:53.096
that you are doing something of that kind.
Now, as far as possible

00:08:53.297 --> 00:08:57.810
never tell anybody to do anything.
That hurts people.

00:08:58.011 --> 00:09:01.790
Say for example, supposing, you people
are there,

00:09:01.991 --> 00:09:05.152
I will tell you that, “Do this. Put
the lights on.”

00:09:05.353 --> 00:09:09.696
Because after all you are My children, it’s
alright; it’s a different relationship.

00:09:09.897 --> 00:09:13.755
But when you are dealing with others,
you see, like you should -

00:09:13.956 --> 00:09:18.740
somebody is there sitting, if you want
to put on the light, slowly,

00:09:18.941 --> 00:09:22.487
while talking, you get up and put on
the light.

00:09:22.688 --> 00:09:27.302
Ask him: “Would you mind if I put on
the light?” Let him say.

00:09:27.527 --> 00:09:31.908
But in any behaviourally aggression is
the first impression.

00:09:32.109 --> 00:09:36.026
Is the other way round in Sahaja Yoga.
In Sahaja Yoga I first raise the Kundalini,

00:09:36.227 --> 00:09:38.540
then do this and do that. Is the other way
round it is.

00:09:38.741 --> 00:09:41.083
You have to build them up from
the foundation

00:09:41.284 --> 00:09:43.131
if you have to impress them outside.

00:09:43.332 --> 00:09:46.245
To build them up from the foundation,
the first is thing is

00:09:46.446 --> 00:09:53.936
that you must infuse in them a kind of
a trust in you. They should trust you.

00:09:54.145 --> 00:09:57.503
They should know that whatever you are
saying is the truth.

00:09:57.704 --> 00:10:04.343
That you are not telling them something
that is false or you have no faith in it.

00:10:04.544 --> 00:10:09.464
So in the way you tell them, it influences
them very much

00:10:09.665 --> 00:10:12.962
that “Tthis man is telling the truth.”

00:10:13.305 --> 00:10:20.420
So the whole thing should start from your
behavioural style, you can say.

00:10:20.621 --> 00:10:25.529
Now the dress also, I would say - dress is
very important in influencing others.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:30.643
Now supposing you are connected with
somebody in an official way, or in any way,

00:10:30.844 --> 00:10:33.498
that you want to influence in the business
and all that.

00:10:33.699 --> 00:10:37.588
Best thing is to wear a business dress,
not to wear a dress

00:10:37.789 --> 00:10:44.966
that is relaxed or casual. No. You must
wear a dress which is a business dress,

00:10:45.167 --> 00:10:51.433
you see, like a - you can say, a deep blue
suit with low strips,

00:10:51.634 --> 00:10:58.264
and a proper three-piece smart thing,
and a smart, clean shoes,

00:10:58.465 --> 00:11:04.144
and hair nicely done, maybe little bit
oiled, it’s alright.

00:11:04.345 --> 00:11:08.709
Look like a smart business person.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:13.871
But if you try to do the fashions of the
world, you see, then it changes every day.

00:11:14.072 --> 00:11:16.432
Today the hair will be this side, tomorrow
that side.

00:11:16.633 --> 00:11:22.667
So make the hairstyle as an official would
do. Is to properly comb the hair.

00:11:22.828 --> 00:11:29.092
In the olden days, if you see, even
the heroes or anything of the films

00:11:29.293 --> 00:11:31.396
used to have oil in their head.

00:11:31.597 --> 00:11:35.072
They never had this kind of hair which was
dry and this and that.

00:11:35.273 --> 00:11:39.810
But, I mean, it need not be oil, but should
be properly groomed as they say.

00:11:40.011 --> 00:11:42.149
There are lots of things available
in the market

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:45.006
which can just groom your hair without
oiling it.

00:11:45.207 --> 00:11:49.230
So it should be properly groomed hair.
And you should not be something -

00:11:49.431 --> 00:11:52.650
so that you show that you have paid
attention to your appearances,

00:11:52.851 --> 00:11:56.195
you have paid attention to your hairstyle
and everything.

00:11:56.396 --> 00:12:00.414
So you make an image out of you which
is absolutely suitable

00:12:00.615 --> 00:12:03.560
for a particular type of a job.

00:12:03.761 --> 00:12:08.390
Now, for a cook, say for example, if cook
dresses up like a,

00:12:08.591 --> 00:12:12.603
if you - supposing a cook appears
in a swimsuit –

00:12:12.804 --> 00:12:16.765
what do you think of that? It’s horrid!
A cook has to dress up like a cook.

00:12:16.966 --> 00:12:22.120
In the same way, a businessman also has
to dress up like a businessman.

00:12:22.321 --> 00:12:26.824
Now you cannot go about in jeans in your
office. You should not,

00:12:27.025 --> 00:12:32.217
because if you do it, everybody will do it.
And all these things are creating laxity.

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:35.428
Laxity is alright outside the office,

00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:40.295
outside your business, alright, but not
where you have the business.

00:12:40.496 --> 00:12:44.580
Like we have drawing rooms; now drawing
room is a drawing room, it’s not a bedroom.

00:12:44.781 --> 00:12:48.758
You should not mix them up. Once you start
mixing them up, there’s no end to it.

00:12:48.959 --> 00:12:52.158
One can go to any limit. I have seen people
going to office

00:12:52.359 --> 00:12:56.361
in dresses which really look like
a swimsuit.

00:12:57.625 --> 00:13:00.845
So this has to be revived,

00:13:01.046 --> 00:13:05.404
and can be revived very easily if you
tell people

00:13:05.605 --> 00:13:09.662
that you won’t be able to influence people
unless and until you keep

00:13:09.878 --> 00:13:16.029
that kind of a form, and an upright
behaviour.

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:20.741
In dealing with others is another point,
very important;

00:13:20.942 --> 00:13:24.159
that you have to be truthful. Don’t tell
lies.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:29.085
But if you have to tell something, then you
must tell straightforward.

00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:31.572
But everything need not be told also,

00:13:31.773 --> 00:13:34.614
that is not telling lies. Everything need
not be told.

00:13:34.815 --> 00:13:38.413
Whatever you have to tell you should say;
this much is this, that’s all.

00:13:38.614 --> 00:13:40.724
But you shouldn’t tell one thing today,

00:13:40.925 --> 00:13:43.560
tomorrow another thing, day-after-tomorrow
another thing.

00:13:43.761 --> 00:13:49.114
That creates a very big gap in the mind
of a human being, unconsciously,

00:13:49.322 --> 00:13:52.169
and he thinks, “Oh, he is a cheat,

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:57.062
and he is trying to evade the issue
or something.”

00:13:57.642 --> 00:14:02.694
Supposing now I’m talking to you, and then
I start looking at the watch,

00:14:02.935 --> 00:14:05.719
then it is insulting.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.700
Supposing you are talking about something,
some particular thing,

00:14:09.901 --> 00:14:17.409
and then suddenly I change the topic;
then it is again insulting.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:21.083
Because everybody is intelligent to see
that you are trying to avoid the issue.

00:14:21.284 --> 00:14:25.131
But up to a point you should take it,
and then, the whole thing

00:14:25.332 --> 00:14:28.620
if it is ridiculous, you should bring
to a point to show that.

00:14:28.821 --> 00:14:31.654
Like yesterday, I said that, “You see,
I never wrote about a serpent.

00:14:31.855 --> 00:14:34.988
If somebody else has written, why should
I explain it?

00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:39.317
I never call it a serpent energy, because
that confuses people.

00:14:39.493 --> 00:14:43.730
But if somebody has called it a serpent
doesn’t matter. What can we do about it?”

00:14:43.931 --> 00:14:49.622
And when you say such a thing, you see,
bring it to a ridiculous conclusion

00:14:49.823 --> 00:14:52.874
of the whole thing, so the person himself
keeps quiet.

00:14:53.075 --> 00:14:55.939
But you should not suddenly change
the topic.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:59.945
That means you are evading the issue;
you don’t know how to handle it. You see?

00:15:00.146 --> 00:15:02.860
This is something sometimes people,
just while talking, they’ll say,

00:15:03.061 --> 00:15:06.823
“Alright, let’s talk about this.” You
cannot.

00:15:07.002 --> 00:15:11.511
And a diversion in talking like that can
create a big problem.

00:15:11.712 --> 00:15:17.263
Another is: while talking to others, don’t
talk about yourself;

00:15:17.472 --> 00:15:21.334
“I am this and I am (that).” No one likes
that. It’s stupid, to talk about yourself.

00:15:21.535 --> 00:15:24.310
“I have this thing. I am this thing.”
Nothing!

00:15:24.511 --> 00:15:27.559
Now, you just all the time ask, “So what
are you doing?

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:33.526
What is your profession? How are you?”,
this, that; all sorts of questions to him.

00:15:33.727 --> 00:15:37.553
Now, if he says to anything - then you
have to talk,

00:15:37.761 --> 00:15:39.952
say, about your organization, then you
shouldn’t say ‘I’,

00:15:40.153 --> 00:15:44.296
you should say ‘we’. You should always
say ‘we’.

00:15:44.497 --> 00:15:47.151
‘We don’t do it. We are”. ‘We’ means
the organization.

00:15:47.351 --> 00:15:51.710
You always refer to the organization and
never to yourself.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:56.684
“I would not do such a thing. I hate it.
I believe into it.” It’s absolutely absurd.

00:15:56.885 --> 00:16:00.744
What you have to do that, “We, we, we
believe… We, we think this way,

00:16:00.945 --> 00:16:06.360
and what is your opinion? We have this
kind of a thing.”

00:16:06.561 --> 00:16:09.174
Or anything that you want to tell them
about

00:16:09.396 --> 00:16:15.436
your own organization or your own product
or anything,

00:16:15.637 --> 00:16:20.518
you have to tell them that, “See, this is
what is available to you.

00:16:20.719 --> 00:16:27.116
Now it is here, and we have seen that
it has done lot of good,

00:16:27.317 --> 00:16:33.807
and it works this way. And we have got
very good reports about it.

00:16:34.015 --> 00:16:37.257
You can see the reports. We have the reports
here. You can see what is it.

00:16:37.436 --> 00:16:43.240
And, if you please, you can try it, and see
for yourself.”

00:16:43.441 --> 00:16:47.268
The amount of services you give
to the person

00:16:47.469 --> 00:16:50.983
is very much appreciated by another person.

00:16:51.184 --> 00:16:53.824
It’s not only ego, but it makes a person
very comfortable.

00:16:54.025 --> 00:16:58.115
Like, people would like to travel by Air
India very much.

00:16:58.316 --> 00:17:01.053
Many people say they would like to travel
by Air India.

00:17:01.254 --> 00:17:04.993
I tried to understand why; because these
days it’s difficult,

00:17:05.194 --> 00:17:09.498
because they examine you too much, and
also because of bombing and this and that.

00:17:09.699 --> 00:17:13.368
So I thought that Air India would be
very difficult.

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:19.613
And they have raised the prices of their -
what you call - travel

00:17:19.814 --> 00:17:27.687
because they have to do extra spending on
getting people checked and this and that.

00:17:27.872 --> 00:17:31.359
But the reason why people take to Air
India is this -

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:36.847
the ladies who work there are extremely
modest type.

00:17:37.048 --> 00:17:40.058
And they look after the people very well.

00:17:40.259 --> 00:17:42.856
They are not cheap, they are not cheap
women;

00:17:43.057 --> 00:17:46.923
and when they serve people, they take
good care.

00:17:47.124 --> 00:17:54.883
And the food is lavish, absolutely lavish;
eat as much as you like; a lot of food.

00:17:55.084 --> 00:17:58.206
They give you five, six times food,
whatever you like.

00:17:58.407 --> 00:18:01.695
And you feel quite happy to have all that.

00:18:01.896 --> 00:18:07.011
And the slightest - if you press the button,
immediately they are available to you.

00:18:07.219 --> 00:18:09.981
So what I’m saying, when you are really
marketing things,

00:18:10.182 --> 00:18:12.898
you must know you are on the other end.

00:18:13.099 --> 00:18:17.384
You are not to be serviced, but you have
to service.

00:18:17.585 --> 00:18:21.643
Once you realise that you have to service
others, your attitude changes.

00:18:21.844 --> 00:18:24.938
You see, you have to service others. Only
through your services

00:18:25.139 --> 00:18:27.861
they are going to work out. I’ll tell you
how.

00:18:28.062 --> 00:18:32.805
Like - specially with the English is a big
problem.

00:18:33.006 --> 00:18:36.090
That’s why they are losing so much.
They are extremely arrogant.

00:18:36.291 --> 00:18:41.256
If you go to an Englishman and ask him
that,

00:18:41.457 --> 00:18:45.419
“Can I see what product you have?”
“What do you want?!”

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:47.716
“No, I would like to see the product that
you have.”

00:18:47.917 --> 00:18:51.700
“Alright; we just now don’t have any
arrangements here to give you anything.

00:18:51.901 --> 00:18:56.906
But if you leave your note we’ll send you.”
Finished! That fellow is not bothered.

00:18:57.107 --> 00:19:01.961
You should be properly equipped all
the time to attend to people.

00:19:02.162 --> 00:19:06.513
In the sense, in an organisation… now
supposing you are having some product,

00:19:06.714 --> 00:19:09.064
then you should know all about it.
The brochures should be there.

00:19:09.265 --> 00:19:11.137
It’s all the time available whenever
you want it,

00:19:11.338 --> 00:19:13.791
it should be properly priced, systematically
kept.

00:19:13.992 --> 00:19:17.643
If somebody comes, if you know the person,
if it has validity,

00:19:17.812 --> 00:19:20.996
you see, he is the one who can do some
business with you, say:

00:19:21.197 --> 00:19:25.459
“Here it is. Please have it. You can see
yourself” - explain to him what it is -

00:19:25.659 --> 00:19:29.326
“And this is what it is, and we can give
you so much concession in that;

00:19:29.527 --> 00:19:34.661
could be this much.” And all those things
are going to capture the market.

00:19:34.862 --> 00:19:38.284
The market does not capture - not because
of the product so much,

00:19:38.485 --> 00:19:42.153
but because of the way it is put forward.

00:19:42.354 --> 00:19:44.091
The way it is put forward is very
important.

00:19:44.292 --> 00:19:47.458
That you have a proper brochure done,
by proper people,

00:19:47.659 --> 00:19:51.201
or you yourself see to it that it’s done
beautifully.

00:19:51.402 --> 00:19:54.480
Little money doesn’t matter on that,
that whatever is spent

00:19:54.681 --> 00:19:59.333
is a proper of the capital that you have
to put in for the product; is a part of it.

00:19:59.534 --> 00:20:04.434
If you think that just to put a production,
then it won’t sell.

00:20:04.635 --> 00:20:11.263
These are part and parcel in modern times
of any product being made or sold.

00:20:11.464 --> 00:20:14.294
Is a part of the product. To influence
people you don’t have

00:20:14.495 --> 00:20:17.855
to advertise so much as you have to deal
with them.

00:20:18.056 --> 00:20:22.032
I mean, I can tell you this much, that
when I have

00:20:22.233 --> 00:20:24.670
to buy something anywhere I remember
the people

00:20:24.871 --> 00:20:27.649
from whom I bought, and the experiences
I have had.

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:31.096
I think, I would always go to a person who
was kind to Me, nice to Me.

00:20:31.297 --> 00:20:32.925
He may take more money, doesn’t matter.

00:20:33.094 --> 00:20:36.995
But he is kind to Me; he is not shouting
at Me,

00:20:37.196 --> 00:20:40.415
who is well-behaved and his behavior is
nice

00:20:40.616 --> 00:20:44.767
and he doesn’t just try to make fun of Me;

00:20:44.968 --> 00:20:50.099
and also, on the contrary, gives Me all
the information and everything.

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.440
It’s absolutely acceptable.

00:20:52.641 --> 00:20:58.998
Like, I went to see Lloyds; there’s
a company I wanted to put some money.

00:20:59.199 --> 00:21:01.306
I mean, it’s a very big thing to put some
money in some bank,

00:21:01.507 --> 00:21:03.461
they should understand there’s a customer.

00:21:03.662 --> 00:21:10.755
Now, they had put a little girl there.
After all, the people who are to be

00:21:10.956 --> 00:21:15.784
contacting others should be people of
personality. Some little girl was there.

00:21:15.985 --> 00:21:18.020
As soon as I went there, then she said,
“Who are you?”, this thing.

00:21:18.221 --> 00:21:21.899
I told her, “I am this and this and all
that.” “Oh, no, we can’t have you;

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:24.905
you have to get this and, please - we can’t
do it.” So I said alright,

00:21:25.106 --> 00:21:28.359
in deference I said alright. I gave the name
of the High Commissioner

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.524
of India and all those things. I mean,
she should understand

00:21:30.725 --> 00:21:33.643
that I would not say like that.

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:40.955
So, the only thing is that she did not
realize that I was with a driver.

00:21:41.156 --> 00:21:45.261
I had a chauffeur-driven car. I had
a Mercedes with Me

00:21:45.462 --> 00:21:50.138
and I was wearing an expensive sari.
I looked quite respectable,

00:21:50.339 --> 00:21:54.902
and she should have understood that the way
to behave towards Me is different

00:21:55.103 --> 00:21:59.506
from you would behave for an ordinary
laborer. Here is a real customer.

00:21:59.714 --> 00:22:05.926
So she said, “Alright then, I would like
to have your identification,

00:22:06.127 --> 00:22:09.301
then I’ll have to do this, and – no, no,
no, no, no. You fill everything.”

00:22:09.502 --> 00:22:14.343
I got so fed up with her; I went to another;
that is NatWest, I would say.

00:22:14.551 --> 00:22:17.575
I mean, I have got a bank somewhere else,

00:22:17.776 --> 00:22:21.488
but I wanted one near My house. Though
it is far, little far away,

00:22:21.689 --> 00:22:25.948
though it is not in such a good locality,
when I entered in, as soon as I went,

00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:29.888
she was an intelligent woman, she could
see that this is a good customer for us.

00:22:30.089 --> 00:22:33.568
She could see it from My - I was wearing
diamonds, this, that.

00:22:33.769 --> 00:22:37.659
She could see from My personality that
there’s a good customer coming in.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:41.373
Immediately she said, “Please, let us get
into the VIP room.”

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:43.222
I didn’t say anything about VIP room.

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:46.663
She went, took Me inside and she talked
very gently to Me,

00:22:46.864 --> 00:22:52.555
and she said ‘Yes’ and she asked Me, and
she said, “Can I take one minute?”

00:22:52.756 --> 00:22:55.929
She went in and she told somebody
to telephone and find out

00:22:56.130 --> 00:23:00.425
about My, this thing and all that, and
she didn’t say.

00:23:00.626 --> 00:23:03.708
You see, it is not to be done in
the presence of the person,

00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:10.173
but you can verify the person’s personality
and everything secretly, alright,

00:23:10.374 --> 00:23:13.104
in a way that he doesn’t feel bad
or something,

00:23:13.305 --> 00:23:17.070
and to know that who is this man and is he
correct or not, whether he -

00:23:17.271 --> 00:23:19.375
but he should not know that you are
inquiring.

00:23:19.576 --> 00:23:25.560
And you should not in any way show that
you know about him.

00:23:25.761 --> 00:23:29.191
So, you see, that kind of a secrecy helps
a lot,

00:23:29.392 --> 00:23:33.130
because you do not become arrogant, you do
not become blunt;

00:23:33.331 --> 00:23:37.032
or you say, blatantly if you tell somebody,
you see, no one likes you that way.

00:23:37.233 --> 00:23:40.831
The likes and dislikes come when you insult
another

00:23:41.032 --> 00:23:47.639
or you try to put down another person or
you try to doubt another person.

00:23:48.561 --> 00:23:50.815
These are the three things if you look
after -

00:23:51.016 --> 00:23:54.112
that you put the person into a comfortable
position

00:23:54.329 --> 00:24:01.344
and tell him everything; listen to him,
what he has to say; trusting him.

00:24:02.023 --> 00:24:06.882
Then the person looks upon you.

00:24:07.107 --> 00:24:09.949
So, in an organization, if you have to run
any administration

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:16.610
and organization, your personality has
to be absolutely sensible.

00:24:16.811 --> 00:24:20.327
Secondly, what you talk you must follow.

00:24:20.535 --> 00:24:22.521
Supposing I tell you: ”You shouldn’t take
money”,

00:24:22.722 --> 00:24:26.806
and I start grabbing money from you;
supposing – then what will you do?

00:24:27.007 --> 00:24:30.368
You will have no faith in Me, will you?

00:24:33.619 --> 00:24:36.948
I mean, actually, when you give Me money
for pujas

00:24:37.149 --> 00:24:39.551
I keep them in a packet, you see, like
that;

00:24:39.752 --> 00:24:44.694
and use that money for buying the silver
and all that for your… something.

00:24:44.895 --> 00:24:47.156
I need not. I mean it’s out of question.

00:24:47.357 --> 00:24:49.152
You have given Me in puja, it’s supposed
to be Mine,

00:24:49.353 --> 00:24:51.313
and I’ve said, alright, to keep the protocol
alright,

00:24:51.514 --> 00:24:55.888
you put all this silverware… it is My own,
you see,

00:24:56.089 --> 00:24:58.461
but you can use it. I mean, it’s just
a joke,

00:24:58.662 --> 00:25:03.129
but everybody knows that Mother is so clear
cut, is so clear cut.

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:05.744
You have to be clear cut with people.
They should understand

00:25:05.945 --> 00:25:08.819
that you do not play tricks with them,

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:19.409
or you are doing some sort of backhand
outwitting or something.

00:25:19.625 --> 00:25:22.244
Some people do it, you see, at the back
of a person

00:25:22.445 --> 00:25:24.493
they try some sort of a trick and...

00:25:24.694 --> 00:25:28.483
Such a person is never liked; nobody
respects such a person;

00:25:28.684 --> 00:25:32.139
but straightforward dealing with a person
as he is.

00:25:32.347 --> 00:25:35.267
If somebody is not alright, in a mild way
you should say:

00:25:35.468 --> 00:25:38.100
“See, this is the problem is. I’m facing
this problem.

00:25:38.301 --> 00:25:41.452
Now you tell me what is the solution”.

00:25:42.308 --> 00:25:45.435
And then the person doesn’t feel bad.
If you tell a person

00:25:45.636 --> 00:25:51.636
directly they won’t like it. No, they
won’t.

00:25:51.837 --> 00:25:54.562
You won’t like it, I know, if I tell you
something so directly,

00:25:54.763 --> 00:25:59.635
but I tell you everything. But I tell you
in a way that is mild…

00:25:59.836 --> 00:26:03.203
[Aside to Gregoire: “Come along, I’m now
on administration…”]

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:12.843
… something that is mild, that is
congenial,

00:26:13.044 --> 00:26:19.626
that is easily understood and assimilated.

00:26:19.827 --> 00:26:24.996
That is very important, that you must have
a style

00:26:25.197 --> 00:26:35.086
which people understand, and a kind
of a proper behavior.

00:26:35.287 --> 00:26:38.414
[Aside to Gregoire: “Just giving them some
lecture on administration,

00:26:38.629 --> 00:26:39.938
and how to influence…”. Gregoire:
“Should I go out or leave?”.

00:26:40.139 --> 00:26:41.621
Shri Mataji: “No, no, no, no, it’s for
every one of you”.]

00:26:41.829 --> 00:26:45.452
How to influence others, you see, how to -

00:26:45.653 --> 00:26:51.556
actually by not influencing others, you
influence others.

00:26:52.754 --> 00:26:56.368
Art lies in hiding art.

00:26:57.005 --> 00:27:01.366
There should be no deliberations exposed
about it.

00:27:01.575 --> 00:27:08.523
And if you understand how to do that…
(Hindi conversation aside)

00:27:42.302 --> 00:27:45.961
So, you see, you should (Hindi)

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:04.275
Now, so, while talking to someone also,

00:28:04.476 --> 00:28:08.031
even if you don’t understand what they
are talking, you should show

00:28:08.232 --> 00:28:11.257
you are understanding them and listening
to what they are telling you;

00:28:11.458 --> 00:28:14.326
also may be absurd, this thing, that thing.

00:28:14.527 --> 00:28:19.078
Now, when you have to deal, say, about
with three persons,

00:28:19.279 --> 00:28:23.878
or five persons, or ten persons like, then
you have to understand

00:28:24.079 --> 00:28:30.619
that you should always try to create a good
feeling among them, what you call.

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:34.204
Like supposing now, I would like you
to marry say Mary,

00:28:34.405 --> 00:28:40.031
for example, take a position; then I will
tell you about her,

00:28:40.232 --> 00:28:47.742
what she is, in a way that will not hurt
you, not hurt her, but prepare you.

00:28:48.283 --> 00:28:52.445
Because later on you may hear about her
that somebody was saying so,

00:28:52.646 --> 00:28:58.430
and Mother never told you. So in a way,
in a very gentle way you should say,

00:28:58.631 --> 00:29:02.598
“You see, she has little of this thing, but
it’s alright,

00:29:02.799 --> 00:29:08.350
she can be very, very gentle, you can
manage it.

00:29:08.551 --> 00:29:16.334
And it depends on you, how you manage it.”
And then - so that he feels informed,

00:29:16.535 --> 00:29:20.466
knowledgeable about a person, and also
responsible about it,

00:29:20.667 --> 00:29:24.151
that “Now it’s my responsibility.”

00:29:25.287 --> 00:29:30.722
So, to make people responsible is also
a very important part of administration.

00:29:30.923 --> 00:29:32.979
If you start doing every work yourself,

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:38.124
then people will never share your work,
you see. They will never do anything.

00:29:38.325 --> 00:29:45.015
Now to make them responsible, the best
way is by rewarding them.

00:29:45.216 --> 00:29:48.440
You must reward them if somebody has done
a good work.

00:29:48.641 --> 00:29:52.825
“Oh, you’ve done such a good work.”
But not directly like that;

00:29:53.026 --> 00:29:57.457
in a very indirect manner, very indirect
manner you must reward that person.

00:29:57.658 --> 00:30:02.411
Not only in words, but in kind words –
you can do it in kind, small things.

00:30:02.612 --> 00:30:06.048
You see, like, I’ll tell you an example
of Rajesh.

00:30:06.249 --> 00:30:08.184
Rajesh is very sweet, and he doesn’t need
anything.

00:30:08.385 --> 00:30:12.266
I mean, he is such a rich man, and what
can we give him?

00:30:12.467 --> 00:30:14.675
But once he, what - he had taken Me
somewhere

00:30:14.876 --> 00:30:21.988
and he had these Swiss knives, see, Swiss
penknife, and he gave it to the driver

00:30:22.189 --> 00:30:24.988
to cut the fruit or something. And then
it vanished.

00:30:25.189 --> 00:30:28.468
You see, he got very angry, you see, with
him because he couldn’t bear this fellow

00:30:28.684 --> 00:30:32.018
cheating him like this. We took him
to the police station and all that,

00:30:32.219 --> 00:30:35.745
but he couldn’t get it. The driver had
managed it, you see.

00:30:35.946 --> 00:30:38.764
It was a taxi. So he was very angry with
the driver.

00:30:38.972 --> 00:30:42.021
So I saw that, I said, “Let it be. It’s
alright, doesn’t matter.”

00:30:42.222 --> 00:30:45.796
Next time when I went to India, I took
a very nice knife for him.

00:30:45.997 --> 00:30:49.791
When he saw it, he just melted away.
He said, “Mother, how did You remember?”

00:30:49.992 --> 00:30:52.400
I said, “You were so upset at that time!”
He said,

00:30:52.601 --> 00:30:56.270
“Not because of the knife as such, but
because of the way this fellow cheated me.”

00:30:56.471 --> 00:30:59.001
But the whole thing neutralized, you see,
and he was…

00:30:59.202 --> 00:31:05.084
So, little, little things if you watch
of a person, it’s very sweet.

00:31:05.285 --> 00:31:08.241
Like I’ll tell you about Gregoire; once we
went to a shop

00:31:08.442 --> 00:31:12.170
to buy some saris, you see, for Myself
I was buying some saris.

00:31:12.371 --> 00:31:16.907
And I thought, “I’ve bought quite a lot
now.” And I liked one sari very, very much,

00:31:17.108 --> 00:31:19.229
but I didn’t buy it. I thought it was too
much money,

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:21.405
I shouldn’t waste all this money, it will
not be needed

00:31:21.606 --> 00:31:24.188
and whatever it is – I gave it up.

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:27.831
And next day Gregoire bought that sari
as a present to Me,

00:31:28.039 --> 00:31:31.137
and really I treasured that sari.
I remember…

00:31:31.338 --> 00:31:37.692
You see, every incident can be made
into some sort of a very valid thing.

00:31:37.893 --> 00:31:40.154
You can say kind of like a puja we can
call it;

00:31:40.355 --> 00:31:43.608
but like a very valid thing that: “Oh,
this was…”

00:31:43.809 --> 00:31:48.861
So all these things make a difference in
an organization where you are working.

00:31:49.061 --> 00:31:52.025
Little, little things like that. Also they
should feel

00:31:52.226 --> 00:31:56.651
that you are responsible for them in
an organization, very important.

00:31:56.852 --> 00:32:02.849
I’ll say, like once in My husband’s office

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:06.771
you see, one fellow joined another
organization.

00:32:06.972 --> 00:32:09.061
And he told not to join another
organization,

00:32:09.262 --> 00:32:11.223
but he joined it because there was more
money.

00:32:11.424 --> 00:32:14.877
And when he went there he found it was
all a very horrible thing.

00:32:15.078 --> 00:32:18.709
There was nothing good happening only
except for the money,

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:21.298
he was very unhappy there, so he wanted
to come back.

00:32:21.499 --> 00:32:25.843
When he came back – you see, My husband
was very annoyed.

00:32:26.044 --> 00:32:28.491
He said, “I told you not to go there.
Why did you go?

00:32:28.692 --> 00:32:36.086
And, what was the need to do such a thing?
Now I cannot take you back.”

00:32:36.294 --> 00:32:41.073
So the fellow came to Me. I don’t know
why he thought of it, but he came to Me.

00:32:41.274 --> 00:32:46.173
He told Me: “This is what has happened but
I want to come back to shipping corporation,

00:32:46.374 --> 00:32:50.248
and I’ve made some mistakes. I think
I’ve made a big mistake.

00:32:50.449 --> 00:32:52.790
But Mr. Shrivastava is somehow or other
is angry with me.

00:32:52.991 --> 00:32:54.460
He doesn’t want to take me back.”

00:32:54.661 --> 00:32:58.420
So when Mr. Shrivastava came home I said
that he came to see Me.

00:32:58.621 --> 00:33:02.771
“Oh! So he came to see you – as if you are
my boss!”. And, you see, he got very angry.

00:33:02.972 --> 00:33:05.337
So I said, “He wants to join your
organisation.

00:33:05.545 --> 00:33:10.191
I think you should give a consideration to
him.” He said, “Why did he come to you?”

00:33:10.392 --> 00:33:14.712
“I think - I said - he thought I’m more
forgiving than you are, perhaps”.

00:33:14.913 --> 00:33:17.738
That put him right. He said, “What do you
mean?

00:33:17.939 --> 00:33:22.187
I can be forgiving too.” “So then forgive
him!”

00:33:24.854 --> 00:33:28.773
These are the tricks, you see, which I have
natural, but you can imbibe also.

00:33:28.974 --> 00:33:32.404
Not difficult to impress others, you see.

00:33:32.605 --> 00:33:37.607
Such little, little things make
a difference, you see.

00:33:37.808 --> 00:33:40.039
When they are sick you must look after
them.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:46.911
Find out if their children are sick,
if their wives are sick.

00:33:47.112 --> 00:33:50.033
You should be concerned and you should
be identified.

00:33:50.234 --> 00:33:53.988
In an organization you must treat it like
a family; absolutely like a family.

00:33:54.189 --> 00:33:55.856
“What’s wrong with her? Is she all right?

00:33:56.057 --> 00:33:58.127
Do you need any help?”, this thing,
that thing.

00:33:58.328 --> 00:34:02.440
Send sometimes the flowers if the husband
is sick, or wife is sick,

00:34:02.641 --> 00:34:07.607
or about the children make enquiries.
All these things mean a lot.

00:34:07.808 --> 00:34:11.746
But while - normally people what they do,

00:34:12.352 --> 00:34:16.117
on a Christmas Day at the most they might
send a card or something.

00:34:16.318 --> 00:34:19.609
But you can have in the organization
a proper card system.

00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:23.164
You should sign them at hand (unclear)
yourself, and one line somewhere

00:34:23.365 --> 00:34:28.112
if you know something: “I hope your wife is
alright. I hope the children are alright”.

00:34:28.313 --> 00:34:30.988
If you know the wife: “Please convey
my regards to her”.

00:34:31.189 --> 00:34:35.745
There’s no need to make them drink like
fish, but it’s more to make them feel

00:34:35.946 --> 00:34:39.100
that they are loved and they are liked
in the organization,

00:34:39.301 --> 00:34:42.533
they are very important, this kind
of thing.

00:34:42.748 --> 00:34:45.464
Even the suggestion, like say, you see,
changing a position of a person;

00:34:45.665 --> 00:34:51.224
now, supposing, now if I want now Christine
to be the leader in America

00:34:51.425 --> 00:34:54.258
and Gregoire to be the – to be there,
to have you,

00:34:54.459 --> 00:34:56.252
but not to interfere with Christine,

00:34:56.453 --> 00:34:59.350
I said: “Gregoire, see now, she is there,
she is handling people better,

00:34:59.551 --> 00:35:01.832
she knows them, people have love and
respect.

00:35:02.033 --> 00:35:04.064
Suddenly you are a new person going there.

00:35:04.265 --> 00:35:06.469
So I don’t want - and you will be her
husband -

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:10.062
so, as it is you are one of the world
leaders, you see,

00:35:10.263 --> 00:35:14.931
and you should have nothing to do with
the local stuff, you see.” He understood it.

00:35:15.139 --> 00:35:18.205
But had I said, “You don’t talk anything
there! Now you keep quiet!”

00:35:18.406 --> 00:35:21.700
I mean, it would not have worked out.

00:35:24.058 --> 00:35:27.930
And that he is, he knows that very well.
That he is that way one of the world leaders

00:35:28.131 --> 00:35:31.165
and we have Warren like that. Some of you
have come up like that,

00:35:31.366 --> 00:35:34.542
that anywhere in the whole world you can
go and do anything you like.

00:35:34.743 --> 00:35:38.799
Like I would say Rajesh is another one who
is coming up.

00:35:39.221 --> 00:35:46.010
But unless and until you make proper
arrangements

00:35:46.649 --> 00:35:50.014
you should not shift a person suddenly.
See, you should try

00:35:50.215 --> 00:35:55.733
to see that this person suddenly shifted
won’t be alright.

00:35:55.934 --> 00:36:00.387
But you must also find out if you really
want to shift

00:36:00.588 --> 00:36:03.520
a person or not. If you are uncertain,
better keep it hanging.

00:36:03.721 --> 00:36:06.843
You see, time is the best way to allow
things to happen like this, you see.

00:36:07.044 --> 00:36:10.219
Allow little time to pass away. Give
a little hint to a person,

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:15.135
“You see, people are complaining. What
to do? I’d like you to help me out, like.”

00:36:15.336 --> 00:36:19.948
So that he also thinks that you’ve given
him the sufficient time to improve.

00:36:20.179 --> 00:36:22.805
You know, that way. But if you don’t give
any time

00:36:23.006 --> 00:36:29.328
and you just tell a person: “Now, you get
out!”, he’ll become your enemy.

00:36:29.529 --> 00:36:32.110
But, on the contrary, you should say,
“I’m sorry, but these people are such,

00:36:32.311 --> 00:36:37.165
they are trying to, you see, trouble us
and trouble me all the time,

00:36:37.366 --> 00:36:41.705
and I don’t know what’s wrong with them,
but, see, please take care and all that.”

00:36:41.884 --> 00:36:44.257
And things work out. People take it,
you see, they understand

00:36:44.458 --> 00:36:46.483
that you are responsible for yourself,

00:36:46.684 --> 00:36:50.206
and that I am putting that responsibility
on them.

00:36:50.407 --> 00:36:52.408
That is how it should be worked out.

00:36:52.584 --> 00:36:55.362
There’s a shop in Lucknow and he makes
very good sweets,

00:36:55.563 --> 00:36:59.022
very famous for its sweets, you see.
And now his father is gone

00:36:59.223 --> 00:37:03.050
but the son is sitting with his big stomach
he has got there, he is sitting there.

00:37:03.251 --> 00:37:06.644
And everybody goes there to his shop
to buy.

00:37:06.845 --> 00:37:09.559
And you cannot take a car; you have to walk
quite a long distance.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:12.451
Now his trick is such, which I have noticed
that.

00:37:12.652 --> 00:37:17.215
What he will do that he will take your
first order, then you said,

00:37:17.416 --> 00:37:22.433
“Alright, please this”. Then you are sitting
there. Then he’ll say, “What are you doing?

00:37:22.634 --> 00:37:26.019
Why don’t you give her things? She has
been sitting for such a long time.”

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:30.179
He’ll tell Me: “Look at these people, you
see. They just go on taking

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:34.851
so much time of people. Now I hope you
don’t have to go by the airplane just now.”

00:37:35.052 --> 00:37:39.232
I said, “No, no. I’m alright, it’s alright.”
So, on an apology all the time, you see.

00:37:39.433 --> 00:37:44.413
So then he’ll say: “Why not taste some of
these things I’ve made specially, just try.”

00:37:44.614 --> 00:37:47.177
So you eat something; “Alright, give me
this also more” -

00:37:47.378 --> 00:37:52.346
like that he goes on, you see, giving time.
And then, after some time,

00:37:52.547 --> 00:37:55.270
again he’ll say: “Oh now, look at these
people, how horrid they are.

00:37:55.486 --> 00:37:57.959
They don’t know how to finish the work.

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:01.407
Hey! What are you doing there? Why don’t
you give some, Her sweets to the lady?

00:38:01.608 --> 00:38:03.879
She has to go now. Why are you taking
so much time?

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.818
I’m sorry, but will you taste this till
then, they’ll bring it”.

00:38:07.019 --> 00:38:09.829
So he gives something else. So you say:
“Alright, give me this”.

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:12.649
By the time you go from there all your
money is finished

00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:17.774
and you have bought all the sweets
of the shop! And that’s the trick he plays.

00:38:17.975 --> 00:38:21.210
And it’s - then after some time you
discover it that, and you say that,

00:38:21.411 --> 00:38:23.582
“I know all these tricks. Now, will you
please give Me whatever I want

00:38:23.783 --> 00:38:26.402
and I’ll leave!”

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:30.868
So what I’m saying that a relationship
of sweetness and this thing develops

00:38:31.069 --> 00:38:36.562
when you see that a person how sweetly
he is selling his things, products to us.

00:38:36.763 --> 00:38:38.804
On the contrary: “This is my product.

00:38:39.005 --> 00:38:44.560
If you want you have it. Otherwise, get
out!” “Yes, alright, you get out first”.

00:38:45.734 --> 00:38:50.617
The whole attitude of selling is now
turning back

00:38:50.818 --> 00:38:55.352
to a proper relationship between the person
who wants to sell -

00:38:55.553 --> 00:38:58.399
seller - and the purchaser.

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:01.388
It’s just the relationship that works, not
the product.

00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:06.223
Let the product go to hell! Nobody is
bothered about the product.

00:39:07.209 --> 00:39:09.852
Of course, I mean, if you just cheat them
is alright,

00:39:10.053 --> 00:39:14.691
but between A, B, C, D, E – if you have
five products,

00:39:14.892 --> 00:39:20.211
people will take - and they are equally
about the same, equally good -

00:39:20.412 --> 00:39:25.320
then people will go to the organization
which is sensible,

00:39:25.521 --> 00:39:28.610
which receives people sensibly, respects
them

00:39:28.811 --> 00:39:39.422
and delivers the thing in time, and a thing
that is not so useless.

00:39:39.623 --> 00:39:43.181
Of course, you must find out what is
the good in the other organizations,

00:39:43.382 --> 00:39:46.955
what they are having, and what they are
selling. You should find out.

00:39:47.156 --> 00:39:50.187
That is important. And why people like
that.

00:39:50.388 --> 00:39:53.782
But mostly I’ve seen what works out
is nothing

00:39:53.983 --> 00:39:57.524
but your relationship with the customer.

00:39:57.725 --> 00:40:01.192
But also your relationship in the office
should be good.

00:40:01.393 --> 00:40:05.062
That’s both the things should work out.
The relationship must be good.

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:07.815
First of all your personality should be
good. I was telling him, you see,

00:40:08.016 --> 00:40:10.957
people who wear the fashionable dresses
in the office, you see,

00:40:11.158 --> 00:40:18.721
cannot be good administrators, cannot.
Because, you see, they become little loose,

00:40:18.922 --> 00:40:22.439
and people start taking advantage
of a loose personality.

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:28.324
But you should be tight, in the sense -
wear an official dress, always, you know.

00:40:28.525 --> 00:40:31.017
People have an awe about that.

00:40:31.218 --> 00:40:34.632
I was telling him, supposing a cook wears,
a lady cook wears

00:40:34.833 --> 00:40:38.929
a swimming dress: no one will like it,
will they?

00:40:40.585 --> 00:40:45.932
In the same way, this new idea, like you
see now, in the offices

00:40:46.133 --> 00:40:52.694
people will call the… everybody, the driver
will call the boss: “Tom, how are you?”.

00:40:52.895 --> 00:40:56.714
Then no respect, it starts like that.

00:40:56.915 --> 00:40:59.534
Or if the boss takes, say, drugs or
something,

00:40:59.735 --> 00:41:03.450
like in India they take what you call
tobacco. Is a tobacco they eat.

00:41:03.651 --> 00:41:11.825
So what happens, that even a peon goes
to the boss

00:41:14.482 --> 00:41:18.970
and the boss says, “Have you got little
bit of …?”. “Yes, yes, yes.”

00:41:19.178 --> 00:41:21.845
So he takes out his own and gives it.
Finished!

00:41:22.046 --> 00:41:24.385
The whole relationship is finished.

00:41:24.586 --> 00:41:32.517
So at that time, if you’re taking drugs, if
you have – if you take drinks or anything,

00:41:32.718 --> 00:41:37.425
whatever habits you have are really
detrimental, but try to cut them.

00:41:37.626 --> 00:41:44.091
But even if you cannot, you do not expect
your subordinates to support that.

00:41:44.292 --> 00:41:48.202
No one likes cheap type of jokes and
things, but, you see, these subordinates

00:41:48.403 --> 00:41:50.739
they pass a cheap type of jokes and they
think they are popular.

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:56.095
They are not. Popularity is to be gained
by aloofness

00:41:56.296 --> 00:42:00.092
and singleness. Not by just becoming
like them.

00:42:00.293 --> 00:42:04.867
Like, another incident I’ll give you that

00:42:05.068 --> 00:42:08.673
in CP’s office there was a lady who
came in a jeans, you see.

00:42:08.874 --> 00:42:13.438
And CP called her. He said, “Madam,
I will not have this.

00:42:13.639 --> 00:42:16.132
You can wear trousers, or you can wear
something, sensible dress,

00:42:16.333 --> 00:42:19.481
but not these jeans.” She said, “No,
but sir, now these days it’s good.”

00:42:19.682 --> 00:42:22.288
He said, “Yes, it’s alright. You can wear
it on the streets. You can wear it

00:42:22.489 --> 00:42:25.095
in the house. You can wear it anywhere –
but not in the office.”

00:42:25.296 --> 00:42:27.971
She said, “No sir, it cannot be so”.
He said, “Alright,

00:42:28.172 --> 00:42:32.258
then will you please resign. I won’t have
you.”

00:42:32.459 --> 00:42:34.169
Then she started wearing proper dresses.

00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:37.005
Because that really makes a difference,
you see.

00:42:37.206 --> 00:42:43.973
Always a dress makes a difference for
proper articulation.

00:42:44.174 --> 00:42:48.600
Absolutely you see that. Now, yesterday
I didn’t have a white sari. Just imagine!

00:42:48.801 --> 00:42:51.826
They never put any white saris for My
programme.

00:42:52.027 --> 00:42:54.867
So, I said: “Now, I always wear a white
sari for My programme”.

00:42:55.068 --> 00:43:00.073
But I had one, this one, the white with
the red border. It makes a difference.

00:43:00.274 --> 00:43:02.505
If I had worn some other sari it could
not happen.

00:43:02.706 --> 00:43:06.564
But supposing I am coming to see you, what
sari I wear has an effect on you.

00:43:06.772 --> 00:43:11.013
“Oh, Mother wore this sari while coming,
you see, just to meet us.”

00:43:11.214 --> 00:43:14.795
It’s like your light; you see, your dress,
your behaviour

00:43:14.996 --> 00:43:18.866
is like your light, whatever you are inside
shows out with that.

00:43:19.067 --> 00:43:21.827
And all these compromises that people
are having nowadays

00:43:22.028 --> 00:43:25.095
is spoiling the administration.

00:43:25.334 --> 00:43:29.199
You must keep to yourself; you must keep
to your position.

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:35.636
Like, now there are, in the offices I’ve
seen, people answer back, you see.

00:43:35.837 --> 00:43:38.122
Your own people will sit down and answer
back.

00:43:38.323 --> 00:43:41.873
But if you see a Japanese firm, one person
will speak, nobody else.

00:43:42.081 --> 00:43:44.947
They’ll all sit tight. When this one person
asks him a question,

00:43:45.148 --> 00:43:46.990
he says, otherwise he doesn’t speak.

00:43:47.198 --> 00:43:51.659
A kind of an absolutely unison exists
between them.

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:56.021
Now what they do – the trick is like this –
before going to any programme

00:43:56.222 --> 00:43:58.047
and all that, he’ll call all his five
people,

00:43:58.248 --> 00:44:00.246
“This is what we are going to discuss
there.

00:44:00.447 --> 00:44:03.290
Now you have to say this and you have
to say this.

00:44:03.491 --> 00:44:05.158
And when I ask you this, you have
to say this.”

00:44:05.359 --> 00:44:08.912
It’s already decided. Nobody is free
to talk in the presence of others.

00:44:09.113 --> 00:44:11.490
All the freedom is before, you see, before
going.

00:44:11.691 --> 00:44:14.180
We do the same with our children. When
Indians have to go

00:44:14.381 --> 00:44:18.077
to somebody’s house, now, they’ll tell
the children, “When you go there,

00:44:18.278 --> 00:44:22.127
you are not to ask for anything. You should
not touch anything there.

00:44:22.328 --> 00:44:27.729
You are not to eat much. I’ll say no
to that.

00:44:27.930 --> 00:44:30.073
And even if you have to eat, take very
little.

00:44:30.274 --> 00:44:33.195
And then, before going, you must say;
“Thank you”.

00:44:33.396 --> 00:44:35.531
When you go there you must say, “Namaskar.”

00:44:35.732 --> 00:44:37.780
All these things are taught in the house,
first of all.

00:44:37.981 --> 00:44:41.653
“Otherwise next time we’ll not take you!”

00:44:45.996 --> 00:44:49.942
So by that thing, you see, what happens
that they are already warned.

00:44:50.143 --> 00:44:51.874
Actually they are knowledgeable what to do.

00:44:52.075 --> 00:44:55.262
Supposing you take five people, come along
for a meeting, sit down there.

00:44:55.463 --> 00:45:00.047
Then they start arguing among themselves,
in the same organization they do.

00:45:00.248 --> 00:45:02.383
Now, for example, now, Sahaja Yogis

00:45:02.584 --> 00:45:04.942
in the beginning used to do the same.
I have seen that.

00:45:05.134 --> 00:45:07.928
They would argue with Me in the presence
of others and it created a problem.

00:45:08.129 --> 00:45:12.321
So I had to tell them: “Now in the presence
of others don’t argue.

00:45:16.465 --> 00:45:19.052
If you want to tell Me, you tell Me”.

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:24.270
And between them to create a good feeling,
you see, no sense of jealousies or anything.

00:45:24.471 --> 00:45:27.933
The jealousy is another thing that plays
very much among your own people.

00:45:28.134 --> 00:45:30.594
So you just have to tell that, “Everybody
has their own job.

00:45:30.795 --> 00:45:33.737
Everything has to be done, and is to be
done well –

00:45:33.938 --> 00:45:35.990
and we are all together; we are one.

00:45:36.214 --> 00:45:39.407
There’s no question of having this hand
having a jealousy with this hand,

00:45:39.608 --> 00:45:41.544
but you are on the left hand, you are
on the right hand. Alright,

00:45:41.745 --> 00:45:43.988
do your right-hand work and you do your
left-hand work

00:45:44.189 --> 00:45:46.958
and the whole thing will work out.
The whole organization has to come up.

00:45:47.159 --> 00:45:50.240
If the organization goes up, we’ll all get
the advantages.”

00:45:50.441 --> 00:45:56.215
So always build them up into a unison
as far the organization is concerned.

00:45:56.416 --> 00:46:04.121
“If we all work out well, if we have more
profits, we’ll have better bonuses”.

00:46:04.367 --> 00:46:07.121
So…
[Tape interruption]

00:46:07.322 --> 00:46:13.883
…innately perhaps maybe I understand
your Kundalinis very well.

00:46:14.084 --> 00:46:18.956
Innately I know how to deal with people;
innately.

00:46:19.157 --> 00:46:22.294
Now, sometimes you have to say about
someone –

00:46:22.495 --> 00:46:27.901
say, I may say about you to him, that, you
see, “Look after him and do this and…”

00:46:28.102 --> 00:46:30.443
Maybe he is rather careless. He won’t
understand

00:46:30.644 --> 00:46:33.623
what I’ve told and he might just say,
“Mother was saying so!”

00:46:33.824 --> 00:46:37.213
So I have to warn him: “You just say
yourself.

00:46:37.414 --> 00:46:39.192
Otherwise it won’t have any effect.

00:46:39.393 --> 00:46:44.266
If I have to tell him, I can tell him
directly. Why I’m telling you?”

00:46:45.086 --> 00:46:48.598
But all these things must be made clear
before he speaks.

00:46:48.799 --> 00:46:52.566
Because once he’s done it, then what’s
the use?

00:46:52.767 --> 00:46:55.075
Then, if he comes to your explanation
to you,

00:46:55.276 --> 00:47:00.086
you should be prepared to say, tell him
why you had to tell him,

00:47:00.287 --> 00:47:04.220
and I didn’t tell you directly. So that
the another person who has tried

00:47:04.421 --> 00:47:10.206
to be stupid is put into his own place;
and your relations remain alright.

00:47:10.407 --> 00:47:16.926
So relationships are to be maintained good
by your own dignity,

00:47:17.127 --> 00:47:23.033
your own sense of respect of yourself,
and the respect of others.

00:47:23.234 --> 00:47:25.309
You see, as you treat yourself, you treat
others.

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:30.503
But first you have no respect for yourself,
how can you respect others?

00:47:30.997 --> 00:47:33.881
And I personally think that, you see,
this fashion business -

00:47:34.082 --> 00:47:38.175
that this is very fashionable, that is very
fashionable - is a beggarish stuff.

00:47:38.376 --> 00:47:43.526
You see, it’s beggarish. Is the beggars
who create the fashion in democracy.

00:47:43.727 --> 00:47:46.696
Democratic countries, you see, another
I’ve found out,

00:47:46.897 --> 00:47:52.604
is a left-sided stuff. And when they create
a fashion, what happens?

00:47:52.805 --> 00:47:56.468
That, say, there are ten beggars who have
nothing,

00:47:56.669 --> 00:47:59.510
so what - the ten people start wearing
a dress like that,

00:47:59.711 --> 00:48:02.767
and even a rich man will start behaving
like that.

00:48:02.968 --> 00:48:05.874
So, it is in the same way, there are ten
stupid fools, you see,

00:48:06.075 --> 00:48:08.230
idiots, they behave like idiots,

00:48:08.431 --> 00:48:11.697
so even an intelligent man thinks something
wrong with him.

00:48:11.898 --> 00:48:14.590
So in a democracy you have to be like
the rest of them,

00:48:14.791 --> 00:48:18.975
so you start behaving like an idiot.
Yes, it’s true!

00:48:19.176 --> 00:48:24.568
I mean, like I have seen some very senior
people, sensible people

00:48:24.769 --> 00:48:28.802
cracking very dirty jokes. And the reason
is, you see, when they came to England

00:48:29.003 --> 00:48:31.912
they found everybody talking like that.

00:48:32.089 --> 00:48:35.130
So they thought: “Am I something different
with me? Oh, I’m also like you.”

00:48:35.331 --> 00:48:39.670
So they will crack a joke. So they stoop
down, you see.

00:48:39.878 --> 00:48:43.623
You don’t have to stoop down, you have
to rise higher to attract them.

00:48:43.824 --> 00:48:47.492
This is the difference: to stoop down
to their level or to rise higher.

00:48:47.693 --> 00:48:50.996
But, while rising higher, you should not
suggest that you are rising higher,

00:48:51.197 --> 00:48:56.406
create any jealousy, or kind of a feeling
that this one thinks no end of himself.

00:48:56.647 --> 00:49:01.932
But in a very gentle manner you should
show that you are higher than them;

00:49:02.164 --> 00:49:04.510
then only they will follow you. Otherwise
they will not.

00:49:04.711 --> 00:49:08.780
If you are lower than them, or of their
style, how, why will they follow?

00:49:08.981 --> 00:49:12.190
Many people do these things, I mean,
such a common thing in the West;

00:49:12.391 --> 00:49:15.804
see, they have lost their sense at all.
But in other countries, like say,

00:49:16.005 --> 00:49:18.022
any country which is a fascist country,

00:49:18.223 --> 00:49:21.080
or a, say, a Communist country, where
they are right-sided,

00:49:21.281 --> 00:49:24.068
what they do, they build up their own
images.

00:49:24.269 --> 00:49:27.319
I would say, even in Japan is the same.
They have their own images.

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:30.074
The leader is a leader, you see, you
cannot talk to him.

00:49:30.275 --> 00:49:33.110
If you have to talk to him, you have
to talk in this manner;

00:49:33.311 --> 00:49:37.606
there’s a system of that kind, and you
cannot behave like this.

00:49:37.807 --> 00:49:42.365
But the leader himself has a projection
of a personality,

00:49:42.566 --> 00:49:45.669
where he treats everyone like a father,
father.

00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:47.490
But here the father behaves like a child.

00:49:47.691 --> 00:49:50.745
The child comes and says: “I want some
drink.”

00:49:50.946 --> 00:49:54.799
So the father pours some whisky and gives
it to his son. Finished!

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.191
That relationship is finished.

00:49:57.399 --> 00:50:03.267
As soon as you try to come to the level
of your child - is finished.

00:50:03.849 --> 00:50:08.257
They must know, there should be an awe.
That’s a part you have to play.

00:50:08.458 --> 00:50:11.548
You should be very friendly, you should be
kind, you should be everything.

00:50:11.749 --> 00:50:13.892
But you must know you are a father
out and out.

00:50:14.093 --> 00:50:15.560
Otherwise children will never respect you.

00:50:15.761 --> 00:50:18.885
In the same way, in any organization
it happens.

00:50:19.086 --> 00:50:22.098
You must keep that distance. For example,

00:50:22.299 --> 00:50:26.078
I would never like anybody to call Me
by name, at all, never.

00:50:26.279 --> 00:50:31.497
But in the office or something I don’t like
someone to call Me by name,

00:50:31.698 --> 00:50:39.179
so I’ll call others, say, in an office or so,
I’ll say ‘Mister’.

00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:45.104
CP’s driver also I’ll say ‘Mister’ to him.
So he dare not call Me by name.

00:50:47.969 --> 00:50:53.811
Yogi: Yes, at school it’s become a fashion
that the students call me with my name.

00:50:54.012 --> 00:51:00.296
Shri Mataji: That’s it! They have no
respect. They have no respect.

00:51:01.689 --> 00:51:04.428
Yogi: All teachers, I mean.

00:51:09.833 --> 00:51:14.636
Yogi 2: Shall I go and take a look
downstairs and see whether the bell…

00:51:14.837 --> 00:51:18.148
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon? Is there
somebody who has come?

00:51:18.349 --> 00:51:21.344
Yogi 2: Well, I heard the bell ringing.
Shri Mataji: Alright, go and have a look.

00:51:21.545 --> 00:51:24.585
Then I’ll go and see. It’s eleven o’clock
now, exactly.

00:51:24.786 --> 00:51:27.886
Now let Gregoire listen to the first part
of it.

00:51:28.087 --> 00:51:29.325
Let’s see what he has to say.
