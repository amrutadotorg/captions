WEBVTT

00:03.396 --> 00:09.908
Now. (Hindi aside)

00:12.251 --> 00:15.592
So. Now to, you see, to influence other
people we must know

00:15.793 --> 00:20.276
how much control we have upon ourselves
also; that’s very important.

00:20.477 --> 00:27.039
For example, some people, you see,
have no proper image

00:27.240 --> 00:30.465
and they try to influence others, so it’s
a mockery.

00:30.666 --> 00:38.693
Nobody gets influenced by such a person
who himself has no image of his own.

00:39.036 --> 00:44.005
So, before working out the exterior,
interior must be worked out.

00:44.206 --> 00:48.248
For example, a person who always comes
late to the office,

00:48.434 --> 00:55.852
and is always delayed and has no
time-sense, is never respected.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.958
So when you tell people that “you should
be in time”,

00:59.159 --> 01:01.309
you should be the first to arrive
at the time, right time.

01:01.510 --> 01:04.391
You must always keep the time, absolutely,

01:04.592 --> 01:07.819
you should be known person for keeping
time.

01:07.978 --> 01:12.185
Say, supposing you have to go to the office
at say ten o’clock,

01:12.386 --> 01:17.443
you reach office in such a way that you are
there five minutes, wait outside

01:17.644 --> 01:22.774
and enter the office exactly at the time
when you have to go.

01:23.737 --> 01:27.400
That punctuality is very important. That
helps people,

01:27.601 --> 01:30.943
and people get an awe about you because
they think that

01:31.144 --> 01:36.615
“This gentleman is so regular and I’m
the one who is absolutely late”.

01:37.577 --> 01:41.668
Also, if you tell somebody that I have
to meet at such and such a time,

01:41.869 --> 01:46.237
and should be arranged at such and such
a time,

01:46.438 --> 01:48.859
then you should be absolutely punctual.

01:49.060 --> 01:56.422
That is very important, that the punctuality
is to be maintained by you.

01:56.623 --> 02:05.248
Now, I’ve seen in the West specially that
people get up very late

02:05.411 --> 02:09.147
and they are very lazy. They walk
in a limpy manner;

02:09.348 --> 02:13.905
and the whole thing shows that, you see,
they are not interested in the world.

02:14.106 --> 02:17.743
They are just pushed into it; somehow
or other they are doing it.

02:17.919 --> 02:21.946
Such a person can never influence anyone,
because people also see your image,

02:22.154 --> 02:24.918
that you yourself you are dragging your
life somehow;

02:25.119 --> 02:30.070
so why to do the same thing, whatever he is
doing he cannot tell us anything.

02:30.271 --> 02:33.774
So that’s another reason you cannot
influence people at all,

02:33.974 --> 02:37.533
if you are yourself a lazy person.

02:37.734 --> 02:42.831
So the person who has to influence others
has to be early riser,

02:43.032 --> 02:45.455
he must have proper habits of sleeping,

02:45.625 --> 02:50.185
he must get up in the morning and be
properly brushed, washed and everything,

02:50.385 --> 02:54.636
and should be what we call a smart man.

02:55.258 --> 03:02.822
Now many people believe that if you try
to be very sort of a

03:03.023 --> 03:08.705
person of a fashionable type, I mean that
you wear dresses

03:08.906 --> 03:13.059
of fashionable style and all that – that
will influence others, it’s not true.

03:13.260 --> 03:17.310
Because they think you have no conviction
of any kind, you see,

03:17.511 --> 03:22.365
so you must build up an image of yourself
that you are such and such.

03:22.566 --> 03:26.935
You see, a kind of a character, as we have
in a drama; it’s a character.

03:27.135 --> 03:32.232
The person speaks with the same character,
he talks with the same character.

03:32.433 --> 03:38.384
And the style should be absolutely known
to people, that this is your style,

03:38.585 --> 03:46.563
that’s how you are, that you do not sort
of compromise on things.

03:49.068 --> 03:54.266
That is very important that when you are
talking to people you must have

03:54.467 --> 03:59.205
a proper style of talking; walking - proper
style.

03:59.385 --> 04:01.821
This should be all trimmed down properly,

04:02.022 --> 04:05.347
that you don’t walk in a languid manner,
you see,

04:05.548 --> 04:08.627
in a manner where (you are) throwing your
legs here and there, walking like that,

04:08.828 --> 04:12.004
but straight, and sit down straight.

04:12.190 --> 04:15.644
And let people see that you have faith
in yourself, first of all.

04:15.821 --> 04:19.400
If you do not have faith in yourself;
I mean, your any behaviour

04:19.601 --> 04:23.270
shows that you have no faith in yourself,
you cannot influence others.

04:23.471 --> 04:31.523
So your self-confidence must be shown
through your all behavioural programming,

04:31.724 --> 04:38.332
like talking, sitting, walking,
communicating,

04:38.533 --> 04:42.360
there should be a thing with confidence.

04:42.655 --> 04:48.813
But the confidence comes in a person when
he realises that he is completely secured.

04:49.014 --> 04:52.884
And in Sahaja Yoga, as you know, that
if your centre heart is secured…

04:53.085 --> 04:55.765
if you know, tell yourself that, “Mother is
with me.

04:55.966 --> 04:59.177
Mother is helping me, and I’m with Mother.

04:59.378 --> 05:02.008
I’ve nothing to worry”. Then your centre
heart will be alright.

05:02.209 --> 05:06.061
Of course, this you cannot tell to others,
but still if you have a personality,

05:06.262 --> 05:10.026
you can imbibe that into others very
simply.

05:10.227 --> 05:13.697
But if you are diffident about yourself
then you cannot do it.

05:13.898 --> 05:18.923
So confidence is to be established, first
of all, within yourself.

05:19.124 --> 05:21.769
For Sahaja Yogis is very easy to say,
“I’m the Spirit,

05:21.970 --> 05:27.063
and I’m the child, I’m the one who has been
chosen by the Adi Shakti Herself.”

05:27.264 --> 05:34.161
So there should be tremendous amount
of confidence in you.

05:37.074 --> 05:44.751
Now. Say, for example, when you are, say,
with the people, how do you eat your food?

05:44.952 --> 05:47.334
Some people, you see, open their mouth
all the time;

05:47.535 --> 05:52.168
eat their food with a sort of a sound and
all that. All these things

05:52.369 --> 05:55.705
are watched by others; how you eat,
how you talk.

05:55.906 --> 06:00.681
And also, normally, you should not keep
your mouth open.

06:00.882 --> 06:03.704
You can never influence people. But keep
your – not pursed either,

06:03.905 --> 06:09.140
but in a normal way – closed, like that,
so that people do not think

06:09.341 --> 06:14.039
that you are just gaping at them, or if
you keep your mouth open all the time.

06:14.240 --> 06:18.813
Or they should not think also that you are
aggressive with them or angry with them,

06:19.014 --> 06:24.266
but a normal face, a – what you call –

06:24.467 --> 06:31.343
a face that is neither aggressive, nor which
is subservient. So it won’t give -

06:31.544 --> 06:34.311
supposing you keep a gaping mouth, they’ll
think, “He is an idiot”.

06:34.512 --> 06:38.228
And if you keep pursed your lips they
will think

06:38.429 --> 06:44.417
that you are a person of aggressive nature.

06:44.618 --> 06:51.165
So one has to understand how you are
sitting before others, talking to others.

06:51.366 --> 06:56.231
And to influence others, first of all, as I
said, you must respect your own personality,

06:56.432 --> 07:00.433
and then respect the personality of others
in your behaviour.

07:00.634 --> 07:03.877
Like, you see, when somebody comes in,

07:04.078 --> 07:06.995
you should talk to them in a very gentle
manner –

07:07.203 --> 07:09.357
knowing that this is another God who is
coming in.

07:09.558 --> 07:12.153
"If there’s Spirit in me, is Spirit in him
also."

07:12.354 --> 07:17.387
So you must see that he sits properly,
he is comfortable,

07:17.588 --> 07:24.829
and ask to - if he wants any tea or
anything. Make him comfortable.

07:25.030 --> 07:31.546
Let him feel that you are not in any way
disturbed, nor that you are irritated,

07:31.747 --> 07:38.279
but you are very happy to meet him and that
you should settle down with kindness.

07:38.480 --> 07:44.039
Sometimes also in diffidence one might feel
nervous about a person if he is there.

07:44.240 --> 07:48.399
That nervousness is a sign of insecurity.
One should not be nervous.

07:48.615 --> 07:53.888
If you are talking to someone, one should
be in a way that

07:54.891 --> 07:57.967
another person should feel absolutely
confident

07:58.168 --> 08:02.213
and should feel that "This gentleman is
going to listen to me."

08:02.414 --> 08:06.904
Now the another way to impress people is:
allow others to talk.

08:07.105 --> 08:11.519
Listen to them properly; not talk yourself,
listen to them.

08:11.720 --> 08:14.976
And once they have said something, then
say, “That’s true, no doubt.

08:15.177 --> 08:18.139
I agree, but…” Then you can start.

08:18.340 --> 08:23.024
So you do not just stun them by your,
“No! Not at all!”, like that.

08:23.225 --> 08:25.773
But on the contrary, you see what they say.

08:25.974 --> 08:28.261
I mean, you can watch Me, I do that
many-a-times.

08:28.462 --> 08:31.695
When somebody says, “Oh, true, it’s true,
but, you see, this is it.”

08:31.896 --> 08:35.097
So they don’t mind. They think that you
have seen the other side of the thing also.

08:35.298 --> 08:40.961
That you have a balance and you just don’t
impress your ideas on the other.

08:41.328 --> 08:47.188
In a way you are, but in a way you do it
that nobody feels that impact,

08:47.389 --> 08:53.096
that you are doing something of that kind.
Now, as far as possible

08:53.297 --> 08:57.810
never tell anybody to do anything.
That hurts people.

08:58.011 --> 09:01.790
Say for example, supposing, you people
are there,

09:01.991 --> 09:05.152
I will tell you that, “Do this. Put
the lights on.”

09:05.353 --> 09:09.696
Because after all you are My children, it’s
alright; it’s a different relationship.

09:09.897 --> 09:13.755
But when you are dealing with others,
you see, like you should -

09:13.956 --> 09:18.740
somebody is there sitting, if you want
to put on the light, slowly,

09:18.941 --> 09:22.487
while talking, you get up and put on
the light.

09:22.688 --> 09:27.302
Ask him: “Would you mind if I put on
the light?” Let him say.

09:27.527 --> 09:31.908
But in any behaviourally aggression is
the first impression.

09:32.109 --> 09:36.026
Is the other way round in Sahaja Yoga.
In Sahaja Yoga I first raise the Kundalini,

09:36.227 --> 09:38.540
then do this and do that. Is the other way
round it is.

09:38.741 --> 09:41.083
You have to build them up from
the foundation

09:41.284 --> 09:43.131
if you have to impress them outside.

09:43.332 --> 09:46.245
To build them up from the foundation,
the first is thing is

09:46.446 --> 09:53.936
that you must infuse in them a kind of
a trust in you. They should trust you.

09:54.145 --> 09:57.503
They should know that whatever you are
saying is the truth.

09:57.704 --> 10:04.343
That you are not telling them something
that is false or you have no faith in it.

10:04.544 --> 10:09.464
So in the way you tell them, it influences
them very much

10:09.665 --> 10:12.962
that “Tthis man is telling the truth.”

10:13.305 --> 10:20.420
So the whole thing should start from your
behavioural style, you can say.

10:20.621 --> 10:25.529
Now the dress also, I would say - dress is
very important in influencing others.

10:25.730 --> 10:30.643
Now supposing you are connected with
somebody in an official way, or in any way,

10:30.844 --> 10:33.498
that you want to influence in the business
and all that.

10:33.699 --> 10:37.588
Best thing is to wear a business dress,
not to wear a dress

10:37.789 --> 10:44.966
that is relaxed or casual. No. You must
wear a dress which is a business dress,

10:45.167 --> 10:51.433
you see, like a - you can say, a deep blue
suit with low strips,

10:51.634 --> 10:58.264
and a proper three-piece smart thing,
and a smart, clean shoes,

10:58.465 --> 11:04.144
and hair nicely done, maybe little bit
oiled, it’s alright.

11:04.345 --> 11:08.709
Look like a smart business person.

11:08.910 --> 11:13.871
But if you try to do the fashions of the
world, you see, then it changes every day.

11:14.072 --> 11:16.432
Today the hair will be this side, tomorrow
that side.

11:16.633 --> 11:22.667
So make the hairstyle as an official would
do. Is to properly comb the hair.

11:22.828 --> 11:29.092
In the olden days, if you see, even
the heroes or anything of the films

11:29.293 --> 11:31.396
used to have oil in their head.

11:31.597 --> 11:35.072
They never had this kind of hair which was
dry and this and that.

11:35.273 --> 11:39.810
But, I mean, it need not be oil, but should
be properly groomed as they say.

11:40.011 --> 11:42.149
There are lots of things available
in the market

11:42.350 --> 11:45.006
which can just groom your hair without
oiling it.

11:45.207 --> 11:49.230
So it should be properly groomed hair.
And you should not be something -

11:49.431 --> 11:52.650
so that you show that you have paid
attention to your appearances,

11:52.851 --> 11:56.195
you have paid attention to your hairstyle
and everything.

11:56.396 --> 12:00.414
So you make an image out of you which
is absolutely suitable

12:00.615 --> 12:03.560
for a particular type of a job.

12:03.761 --> 12:08.390
Now, for a cook, say for example, if cook
dresses up like a,

12:08.591 --> 12:12.603
if you - supposing a cook appears
in a swimsuit –

12:12.804 --> 12:16.765
what do you think of that? It’s horrid!
A cook has to dress up like a cook.

12:16.966 --> 12:22.120
In the same way, a businessman also has
to dress up like a businessman.

12:22.321 --> 12:26.824
Now you cannot go about in jeans in your
office. You should not,

12:27.025 --> 12:32.217
because if you do it, everybody will do it.
And all these things are creating laxity.

12:32.418 --> 12:35.428
Laxity is alright outside the office,

12:35.629 --> 12:40.295
outside your business, alright, but not
where you have the business.

12:40.496 --> 12:44.580
Like we have drawing rooms; now drawing
room is a drawing room, it’s not a bedroom.

12:44.781 --> 12:48.758
You should not mix them up. Once you start
mixing them up, there’s no end to it.

12:48.959 --> 12:52.158
One can go to any limit. I have seen people
going to office

12:52.359 --> 12:56.361
in dresses which really look like
a swimsuit.

12:57.625 --> 13:00.845
So this has to be revived,

13:01.046 --> 13:05.404
and can be revived very easily if you
tell people

13:05.605 --> 13:09.662
that you won’t be able to influence people
unless and until you keep

13:09.878 --> 13:16.029
that kind of a form, and an upright
behaviour.

13:16.230 --> 13:20.741
In dealing with others is another point,
very important;

13:20.942 --> 13:24.159
that you have to be truthful. Don’t tell
lies.

13:24.360 --> 13:29.085
But if you have to tell something, then you
must tell straightforward.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.572
But everything need not be told also,

13:31.773 --> 13:34.614
that is not telling lies. Everything need
not be told.

13:34.815 --> 13:38.413
Whatever you have to tell you should say;
this much is this, that’s all.

13:38.614 --> 13:40.724
But you shouldn’t tell one thing today,

13:40.925 --> 13:43.560
tomorrow another thing, day-after-tomorrow
another thing.

13:43.761 --> 13:49.114
That creates a very big gap in the mind
of a human being, unconsciously,

13:49.322 --> 13:52.169
and he thinks, “Oh, he is a cheat,

13:52.370 --> 13:57.062
and he is trying to evade the issue
or something.”

13:57.642 --> 14:02.694
Supposing now I’m talking to you, and then
I start looking at the watch,

14:02.935 --> 14:05.719
then it is insulting.

14:05.920 --> 14:09.700
Supposing you are talking about something,
some particular thing,

14:09.901 --> 14:17.409
and then suddenly I change the topic;
then it is again insulting.

14:17.610 --> 14:21.083
Because everybody is intelligent to see
that you are trying to avoid the issue.

14:21.284 --> 14:25.131
But up to a point you should take it,
and then, the whole thing

14:25.332 --> 14:28.620
if it is ridiculous, you should bring
to a point to show that.

14:28.821 --> 14:31.654
Like yesterday, I said that, “You see,
I never wrote about a serpent.

14:31.855 --> 14:34.988
If somebody else has written, why should
I explain it?

14:35.189 --> 14:39.317
I never call it a serpent energy, because
that confuses people.

14:39.493 --> 14:43.730
But if somebody has called it a serpent
doesn’t matter. What can we do about it?”

14:43.931 --> 14:49.622
And when you say such a thing, you see,
bring it to a ridiculous conclusion

14:49.823 --> 14:52.874
of the whole thing, so the person himself
keeps quiet.

14:53.075 --> 14:55.939
But you should not suddenly change
the topic.

14:56.140 --> 14:59.945
That means you are evading the issue;
you don’t know how to handle it. You see?

15:00.146 --> 15:02.860
This is something sometimes people,
just while talking, they’ll say,

15:03.061 --> 15:06.823
“Alright, let’s talk about this.” You
cannot.

15:07.002 --> 15:11.511
And a diversion in talking like that can
create a big problem.

15:11.712 --> 15:17.263
Another is: while talking to others, don’t
talk about yourself;

15:17.472 --> 15:21.334
“I am this and I am (that).” No one likes
that. It’s stupid, to talk about yourself.

15:21.535 --> 15:24.310
“I have this thing. I am this thing.”
Nothing!

15:24.511 --> 15:27.559
Now, you just all the time ask, “So what
are you doing?

15:27.760 --> 15:33.526
What is your profession? How are you?”,
this, that; all sorts of questions to him.

15:33.727 --> 15:37.553
Now, if he says to anything - then you
have to talk,

15:37.761 --> 15:39.952
say, about your organization, then you
shouldn’t say ‘I’,

15:40.153 --> 15:44.296
you should say ‘we’. You should always
say ‘we’.

15:44.497 --> 15:47.151
‘We don’t do it. We are”. ‘We’ means
the organization.

15:47.351 --> 15:51.710
You always refer to the organization and
never to yourself.

15:51.920 --> 15:56.684
“I would not do such a thing. I hate it.
I believe into it.” It’s absolutely absurd.

15:56.885 --> 16:00.744
What you have to do that, “We, we, we
believe… We, we think this way,

16:00.945 --> 16:06.360
and what is your opinion? We have this
kind of a thing.”

16:06.561 --> 16:09.174
Or anything that you want to tell them
about

16:09.396 --> 16:15.436
your own organization or your own product
or anything,

16:15.637 --> 16:20.518
you have to tell them that, “See, this is
what is available to you.

16:20.719 --> 16:27.116
Now it is here, and we have seen that
it has done lot of good,

16:27.317 --> 16:33.807
and it works this way. And we have got
very good reports about it.

16:34.015 --> 16:37.257
You can see the reports. We have the reports
here. You can see what is it.

16:37.436 --> 16:43.240
And, if you please, you can try it, and see
for yourself.”

16:43.441 --> 16:47.268
The amount of services you give
to the person

16:47.469 --> 16:50.983
is very much appreciated by another person.

16:51.184 --> 16:53.824
It’s not only ego, but it makes a person
very comfortable.

16:54.025 --> 16:58.115
Like, people would like to travel by Air
India very much.

16:58.316 --> 17:01.053
Many people say they would like to travel
by Air India.

17:01.254 --> 17:04.993
I tried to understand why; because these
days it’s difficult,

17:05.194 --> 17:09.498
because they examine you too much, and
also because of bombing and this and that.

17:09.699 --> 17:13.368
So I thought that Air India would be
very difficult.

17:13.569 --> 17:19.613
And they have raised the prices of their -
what you call - travel

17:19.814 --> 17:27.687
because they have to do extra spending on
getting people checked and this and that.

17:27.872 --> 17:31.359
But the reason why people take to Air
India is this -

17:31.560 --> 17:36.847
the ladies who work there are extremely
modest type.

17:37.048 --> 17:40.058
And they look after the people very well.

17:40.259 --> 17:42.856
They are not cheap, they are not cheap
women;

17:43.057 --> 17:46.923
and when they serve people, they take
good care.

17:47.124 --> 17:54.883
And the food is lavish, absolutely lavish;
eat as much as you like; a lot of food.

17:55.084 --> 17:58.206
They give you five, six times food,
whatever you like.

17:58.407 --> 18:01.695
And you feel quite happy to have all that.

18:01.896 --> 18:07.011
And the slightest - if you press the button,
immediately they are available to you.

18:07.219 --> 18:09.981
So what I’m saying, when you are really
marketing things,

18:10.182 --> 18:12.898
you must know you are on the other end.

18:13.099 --> 18:17.384
You are not to be serviced, but you have
to service.

18:17.585 --> 18:21.643
Once you realise that you have to service
others, your attitude changes.

18:21.844 --> 18:24.938
You see, you have to service others. Only
through your services

18:25.139 --> 18:27.861
they are going to work out. I’ll tell you
how.

18:28.062 --> 18:32.805
Like - specially with the English is a big
problem.

18:33.006 --> 18:36.090
That’s why they are losing so much.
They are extremely arrogant.

18:36.291 --> 18:41.256
If you go to an Englishman and ask him
that,

18:41.457 --> 18:45.419
“Can I see what product you have?”
“What do you want?!”

18:45.620 --> 18:47.716
“No, I would like to see the product that
you have.”

18:47.917 --> 18:51.700
“Alright; we just now don’t have any
arrangements here to give you anything.

18:51.901 --> 18:56.906
But if you leave your note we’ll send you.”
Finished! That fellow is not bothered.

18:57.107 --> 19:01.961
You should be properly equipped all
the time to attend to people.

19:02.162 --> 19:06.513
In the sense, in an organisation… now
supposing you are having some product,

19:06.714 --> 19:09.064
then you should know all about it.
The brochures should be there.

19:09.265 --> 19:11.137
It’s all the time available whenever
you want it,

19:11.338 --> 19:13.791
it should be properly priced, systematically
kept.

19:13.992 --> 19:17.643
If somebody comes, if you know the person,
if it has validity,

19:17.812 --> 19:20.996
you see, he is the one who can do some
business with you, say:

19:21.197 --> 19:25.459
“Here it is. Please have it. You can see
yourself” - explain to him what it is -

19:25.659 --> 19:29.326
“And this is what it is, and we can give
you so much concession in that;

19:29.527 --> 19:34.661
could be this much.” And all those things
are going to capture the market.

19:34.862 --> 19:38.284
The market does not capture - not because
of the product so much,

19:38.485 --> 19:42.153
but because of the way it is put forward.

19:42.354 --> 19:44.091
The way it is put forward is very
important.

19:44.292 --> 19:47.458
That you have a proper brochure done,
by proper people,

19:47.659 --> 19:51.201
or you yourself see to it that it’s done
beautifully.

19:51.402 --> 19:54.480
Little money doesn’t matter on that,
that whatever is spent

19:54.681 --> 19:59.333
is a proper of the capital that you have
to put in for the product; is a part of it.

19:59.534 --> 20:04.434
If you think that just to put a production,
then it won’t sell.

20:04.635 --> 20:11.263
These are part and parcel in modern times
of any product being made or sold.

20:11.464 --> 20:14.294
Is a part of the product. To influence
people you don’t have

20:14.495 --> 20:17.855
to advertise so much as you have to deal
with them.

20:18.056 --> 20:22.032
I mean, I can tell you this much, that
when I have

20:22.233 --> 20:24.670
to buy something anywhere I remember
the people

20:24.871 --> 20:27.649
from whom I bought, and the experiences
I have had.

20:27.850 --> 20:31.096
I think, I would always go to a person who
was kind to Me, nice to Me.

20:31.297 --> 20:32.925
He may take more money, doesn’t matter.

20:33.094 --> 20:36.995
But he is kind to Me; he is not shouting
at Me,

20:37.196 --> 20:40.415
who is well-behaved and his behavior is
nice

20:40.616 --> 20:44.767
and he doesn’t just try to make fun of Me;

20:44.968 --> 20:50.099
and also, on the contrary, gives Me all
the information and everything.

20:50.300 --> 20:52.440
It’s absolutely acceptable.

20:52.641 --> 20:58.998
Like, I went to see Lloyds; there’s
a company I wanted to put some money.

20:59.199 --> 21:01.306
I mean, it’s a very big thing to put some
money in some bank,

21:01.507 --> 21:03.461
they should understand there’s a customer.

21:03.662 --> 21:10.755
Now, they had put a little girl there.
After all, the people who are to be

21:10.956 --> 21:15.784
contacting others should be people of
personality. Some little girl was there.

21:15.985 --> 21:18.020
As soon as I went there, then she said,
“Who are you?”, this thing.

21:18.221 --> 21:21.899
I told her, “I am this and this and all
that.” “Oh, no, we can’t have you;

21:22.100 --> 21:24.905
you have to get this and, please - we can’t
do it.” So I said alright,

21:25.106 --> 21:28.359
in deference I said alright. I gave the name
of the High Commissioner

21:28.560 --> 21:30.524
of India and all those things. I mean,
she should understand

21:30.725 --> 21:33.643
that I would not say like that.

21:33.860 --> 21:40.955
So, the only thing is that she did not
realize that I was with a driver.

21:41.156 --> 21:45.261
I had a chauffeur-driven car. I had
a Mercedes with Me

21:45.462 --> 21:50.138
and I was wearing an expensive sari.
I looked quite respectable,

21:50.339 --> 21:54.902
and she should have understood that the way
to behave towards Me is different

21:55.103 --> 21:59.506
from you would behave for an ordinary
laborer. Here is a real customer.

21:59.714 --> 22:05.926
So she said, “Alright then, I would like
to have your identification,

22:06.127 --> 22:09.301
then I’ll have to do this, and – no, no,
no, no, no. You fill everything.”

22:09.502 --> 22:14.343
I got so fed up with her; I went to another;
that is NatWest, I would say.

22:14.551 --> 22:17.575
I mean, I have got a bank somewhere else,

22:17.776 --> 22:21.488
but I wanted one near My house. Though
it is far, little far away,

22:21.689 --> 22:25.948
though it is not in such a good locality,
when I entered in, as soon as I went,

22:26.149 --> 22:29.888
she was an intelligent woman, she could
see that this is a good customer for us.

22:30.089 --> 22:33.568
She could see it from My - I was wearing
diamonds, this, that.

22:33.769 --> 22:37.659
She could see from My personality that
there’s a good customer coming in.

22:37.860 --> 22:41.373
Immediately she said, “Please, let us get
into the VIP room.”

22:41.550 --> 22:43.222
I didn’t say anything about VIP room.

22:43.430 --> 22:46.663
She went, took Me inside and she talked
very gently to Me,

22:46.864 --> 22:52.555
and she said ‘Yes’ and she asked Me, and
she said, “Can I take one minute?”

22:52.756 --> 22:55.929
She went in and she told somebody
to telephone and find out

22:56.130 --> 23:00.425
about My, this thing and all that, and
she didn’t say.

23:00.626 --> 23:03.708
You see, it is not to be done in
the presence of the person,

23:03.909 --> 23:10.173
but you can verify the person’s personality
and everything secretly, alright,

23:10.374 --> 23:13.104
in a way that he doesn’t feel bad
or something,

23:13.305 --> 23:17.070
and to know that who is this man and is he
correct or not, whether he -

23:17.271 --> 23:19.375
but he should not know that you are
inquiring.

23:19.576 --> 23:25.560
And you should not in any way show that
you know about him.

23:25.761 --> 23:29.191
So, you see, that kind of a secrecy helps
a lot,

23:29.392 --> 23:33.130
because you do not become arrogant, you do
not become blunt;

23:33.331 --> 23:37.032
or you say, blatantly if you tell somebody,
you see, no one likes you that way.

23:37.233 --> 23:40.831
The likes and dislikes come when you insult
another

23:41.032 --> 23:47.639
or you try to put down another person or
you try to doubt another person.

23:48.561 --> 23:50.815
These are the three things if you look
after -

23:51.016 --> 23:54.112
that you put the person into a comfortable
position

23:54.329 --> 24:01.344
and tell him everything; listen to him,
what he has to say; trusting him.

24:02.023 --> 24:06.882
Then the person looks upon you.

24:07.107 --> 24:09.949
So, in an organization, if you have to run
any administration

24:10.150 --> 24:16.610
and organization, your personality has
to be absolutely sensible.

24:16.811 --> 24:20.327
Secondly, what you talk you must follow.

24:20.535 --> 24:22.521
Supposing I tell you: ”You shouldn’t take
money”,

24:22.722 --> 24:26.806
and I start grabbing money from you;
supposing – then what will you do?

24:27.007 --> 24:30.368
You will have no faith in Me, will you?

24:33.619 --> 24:36.948
I mean, actually, when you give Me money
for pujas

24:37.149 --> 24:39.551
I keep them in a packet, you see, like
that;

24:39.752 --> 24:44.694
and use that money for buying the silver
and all that for your… something.

24:44.895 --> 24:47.156
I need not. I mean it’s out of question.

24:47.357 --> 24:49.152
You have given Me in puja, it’s supposed
to be Mine,

24:49.353 --> 24:51.313
and I’ve said, alright, to keep the protocol
alright,

24:51.514 --> 24:55.888
you put all this silverware… it is My own,
you see,

24:56.089 --> 24:58.461
but you can use it. I mean, it’s just
a joke,

24:58.662 --> 25:03.129
but everybody knows that Mother is so clear
cut, is so clear cut.

25:03.330 --> 25:05.744
You have to be clear cut with people.
They should understand

25:05.945 --> 25:08.819
that you do not play tricks with them,

25:09.020 --> 25:19.409
or you are doing some sort of backhand
outwitting or something.

25:19.625 --> 25:22.244
Some people do it, you see, at the back
of a person

25:22.445 --> 25:24.493
they try some sort of a trick and...

25:24.694 --> 25:28.483
Such a person is never liked; nobody
respects such a person;

25:28.684 --> 25:32.139
but straightforward dealing with a person
as he is.

25:32.347 --> 25:35.267
If somebody is not alright, in a mild way
you should say:

25:35.468 --> 25:38.100
“See, this is the problem is. I’m facing
this problem.

25:38.301 --> 25:41.452
Now you tell me what is the solution”.

25:42.308 --> 25:45.435
And then the person doesn’t feel bad.
If you tell a person

25:45.636 --> 25:51.636
directly they won’t like it. No, they
won’t.

25:51.837 --> 25:54.562
You won’t like it, I know, if I tell you
something so directly,

25:54.763 --> 25:59.635
but I tell you everything. But I tell you
in a way that is mild…

25:59.836 --> 26:03.203
[Aside to Gregoire: “Come along, I’m now
on administration…”]

26:06.630 --> 26:12.843
… something that is mild, that is
congenial,

26:13.044 --> 26:19.626
that is easily understood and assimilated.

26:19.827 --> 26:24.996
That is very important, that you must have
a style

26:25.197 --> 26:35.086
which people understand, and a kind
of a proper behavior.

26:35.287 --> 26:38.414
[Aside to Gregoire: “Just giving them some
lecture on administration,

26:38.629 --> 26:39.938
and how to influence…”. Gregoire:
“Should I go out or leave?”.

26:40.139 --> 26:41.621
Shri Mataji: “No, no, no, no, it’s for
every one of you”.]

26:41.829 --> 26:45.452
How to influence others, you see, how to -

26:45.653 --> 26:51.556
actually by not influencing others, you
influence others.

26:52.754 --> 26:56.368
Art lies in hiding art.

26:57.005 --> 27:01.366
There should be no deliberations exposed
about it.

27:01.575 --> 27:08.523
And if you understand how to do that…
(Hindi conversation aside)

27:42.302 --> 27:45.961
So, you see, you should (Hindi)

28:00.120 --> 28:04.275
Now, so, while talking to someone also,

28:04.476 --> 28:08.031
even if you don’t understand what they
are talking, you should show

28:08.232 --> 28:11.257
you are understanding them and listening
to what they are telling you;

28:11.458 --> 28:14.326
also may be absurd, this thing, that thing.

28:14.527 --> 28:19.078
Now, when you have to deal, say, about
with three persons,

28:19.279 --> 28:23.878
or five persons, or ten persons like, then
you have to understand

28:24.079 --> 28:30.619
that you should always try to create a good
feeling among them, what you call.

28:30.820 --> 28:34.204
Like supposing now, I would like you
to marry say Mary,

28:34.405 --> 28:40.031
for example, take a position; then I will
tell you about her,

28:40.232 --> 28:47.742
what she is, in a way that will not hurt
you, not hurt her, but prepare you.

28:48.283 --> 28:52.445
Because later on you may hear about her
that somebody was saying so,

28:52.646 --> 28:58.430
and Mother never told you. So in a way,
in a very gentle way you should say,

28:58.631 --> 29:02.598
“You see, she has little of this thing, but
it’s alright,

29:02.799 --> 29:08.350
she can be very, very gentle, you can
manage it.

29:08.551 --> 29:16.334
And it depends on you, how you manage it.”
And then - so that he feels informed,

29:16.535 --> 29:20.466
knowledgeable about a person, and also
responsible about it,

29:20.667 --> 29:24.151
that “Now it’s my responsibility.”

29:25.287 --> 29:30.722
So, to make people responsible is also
a very important part of administration.

29:30.923 --> 29:32.979
If you start doing every work yourself,

29:33.180 --> 29:38.124
then people will never share your work,
you see. They will never do anything.

29:38.325 --> 29:45.015
Now to make them responsible, the best
way is by rewarding them.

29:45.216 --> 29:48.440
You must reward them if somebody has done
a good work.

29:48.641 --> 29:52.825
“Oh, you’ve done such a good work.”
But not directly like that;

29:53.026 --> 29:57.457
in a very indirect manner, very indirect
manner you must reward that person.

29:57.658 --> 30:02.411
Not only in words, but in kind words –
you can do it in kind, small things.

30:02.612 --> 30:06.048
You see, like, I’ll tell you an example
of Rajesh.

30:06.249 --> 30:08.184
Rajesh is very sweet, and he doesn’t need
anything.

30:08.385 --> 30:12.266
I mean, he is such a rich man, and what
can we give him?

30:12.467 --> 30:14.675
But once he, what - he had taken Me
somewhere

30:14.876 --> 30:21.988
and he had these Swiss knives, see, Swiss
penknife, and he gave it to the driver

30:22.189 --> 30:24.988
to cut the fruit or something. And then
it vanished.

30:25.189 --> 30:28.468
You see, he got very angry, you see, with
him because he couldn’t bear this fellow

30:28.684 --> 30:32.018
cheating him like this. We took him
to the police station and all that,

30:32.219 --> 30:35.745
but he couldn’t get it. The driver had
managed it, you see.

30:35.946 --> 30:38.764
It was a taxi. So he was very angry with
the driver.

30:38.972 --> 30:42.021
So I saw that, I said, “Let it be. It’s
alright, doesn’t matter.”

30:42.222 --> 30:45.796
Next time when I went to India, I took
a very nice knife for him.

30:45.997 --> 30:49.791
When he saw it, he just melted away.
He said, “Mother, how did You remember?”

30:49.992 --> 30:52.400
I said, “You were so upset at that time!”
He said,

30:52.601 --> 30:56.270
“Not because of the knife as such, but
because of the way this fellow cheated me.”

30:56.471 --> 30:59.001
But the whole thing neutralized, you see,
and he was…

30:59.202 --> 31:05.084
So, little, little things if you watch
of a person, it’s very sweet.

31:05.285 --> 31:08.241
Like I’ll tell you about Gregoire; once we
went to a shop

31:08.442 --> 31:12.170
to buy some saris, you see, for Myself
I was buying some saris.

31:12.371 --> 31:16.907
And I thought, “I’ve bought quite a lot
now.” And I liked one sari very, very much,

31:17.108 --> 31:19.229
but I didn’t buy it. I thought it was too
much money,

31:19.430 --> 31:21.405
I shouldn’t waste all this money, it will
not be needed

31:21.606 --> 31:24.188
and whatever it is – I gave it up.

31:24.500 --> 31:27.831
And next day Gregoire bought that sari
as a present to Me,

31:28.039 --> 31:31.137
and really I treasured that sari.
I remember…

31:31.338 --> 31:37.692
You see, every incident can be made
into some sort of a very valid thing.

31:37.893 --> 31:40.154
You can say kind of like a puja we can
call it;

31:40.355 --> 31:43.608
but like a very valid thing that: “Oh,
this was…”

31:43.809 --> 31:48.861
So all these things make a difference in
an organization where you are working.

31:49.061 --> 31:52.025
Little, little things like that. Also they
should feel

31:52.226 --> 31:56.651
that you are responsible for them in
an organization, very important.

31:56.852 --> 32:02.849
I’ll say, like once in My husband’s office

32:03.050 --> 32:06.771
you see, one fellow joined another
organization.

32:06.972 --> 32:09.061
And he told not to join another
organization,

32:09.262 --> 32:11.223
but he joined it because there was more
money.

32:11.424 --> 32:14.877
And when he went there he found it was
all a very horrible thing.

32:15.078 --> 32:18.709
There was nothing good happening only
except for the money,

32:18.910 --> 32:21.298
he was very unhappy there, so he wanted
to come back.

32:21.499 --> 32:25.843
When he came back – you see, My husband
was very annoyed.

32:26.044 --> 32:28.491
He said, “I told you not to go there.
Why did you go?

32:28.692 --> 32:36.086
And, what was the need to do such a thing?
Now I cannot take you back.”

32:36.294 --> 32:41.073
So the fellow came to Me. I don’t know
why he thought of it, but he came to Me.

32:41.274 --> 32:46.173
He told Me: “This is what has happened but
I want to come back to shipping corporation,

32:46.374 --> 32:50.248
and I’ve made some mistakes. I think
I’ve made a big mistake.

32:50.449 --> 32:52.790
But Mr. Shrivastava is somehow or other
is angry with me.

32:52.991 --> 32:54.460
He doesn’t want to take me back.”

32:54.661 --> 32:58.420
So when Mr. Shrivastava came home I said
that he came to see Me.

32:58.621 --> 33:02.771
“Oh! So he came to see you – as if you are
my boss!”. And, you see, he got very angry.

33:02.972 --> 33:05.337
So I said, “He wants to join your
organisation.

33:05.545 --> 33:10.191
I think you should give a consideration to
him.” He said, “Why did he come to you?”

33:10.392 --> 33:14.712
“I think - I said - he thought I’m more
forgiving than you are, perhaps”.

33:14.913 --> 33:17.738
That put him right. He said, “What do you
mean?

33:17.939 --> 33:22.187
I can be forgiving too.” “So then forgive
him!”

33:24.854 --> 33:28.773
These are the tricks, you see, which I have
natural, but you can imbibe also.

33:28.974 --> 33:32.404
Not difficult to impress others, you see.

33:32.605 --> 33:37.607
Such little, little things make
a difference, you see.

33:37.808 --> 33:40.039
When they are sick you must look after
them.

33:40.240 --> 33:46.911
Find out if their children are sick,
if their wives are sick.

33:47.112 --> 33:50.033
You should be concerned and you should
be identified.

33:50.234 --> 33:53.988
In an organization you must treat it like
a family; absolutely like a family.

33:54.189 --> 33:55.856
“What’s wrong with her? Is she all right?

33:56.057 --> 33:58.127
Do you need any help?”, this thing,
that thing.

33:58.328 --> 34:02.440
Send sometimes the flowers if the husband
is sick, or wife is sick,

34:02.641 --> 34:07.607
or about the children make enquiries.
All these things mean a lot.

34:07.808 --> 34:11.746
But while - normally people what they do,

34:12.352 --> 34:16.117
on a Christmas Day at the most they might
send a card or something.

34:16.318 --> 34:19.609
But you can have in the organization
a proper card system.

34:19.810 --> 34:23.164
You should sign them at hand (unclear)
yourself, and one line somewhere

34:23.365 --> 34:28.112
if you know something: “I hope your wife is
alright. I hope the children are alright”.

34:28.313 --> 34:30.988
If you know the wife: “Please convey
my regards to her”.

34:31.189 --> 34:35.745
There’s no need to make them drink like
fish, but it’s more to make them feel

34:35.946 --> 34:39.100
that they are loved and they are liked
in the organization,

34:39.301 --> 34:42.533
they are very important, this kind
of thing.

34:42.748 --> 34:45.464
Even the suggestion, like say, you see,
changing a position of a person;

34:45.665 --> 34:51.224
now, supposing, now if I want now Christine
to be the leader in America

34:51.425 --> 34:54.258
and Gregoire to be the – to be there,
to have you,

34:54.459 --> 34:56.252
but not to interfere with Christine,

34:56.453 --> 34:59.350
I said: “Gregoire, see now, she is there,
she is handling people better,

34:59.551 --> 35:01.832
she knows them, people have love and
respect.

35:02.033 --> 35:04.064
Suddenly you are a new person going there.

35:04.265 --> 35:06.469
So I don’t want - and you will be her
husband -

35:06.670 --> 35:10.062
so, as it is you are one of the world
leaders, you see,

35:10.263 --> 35:14.931
and you should have nothing to do with
the local stuff, you see.” He understood it.

35:15.139 --> 35:18.205
But had I said, “You don’t talk anything
there! Now you keep quiet!”

35:18.406 --> 35:21.700
I mean, it would not have worked out.

35:24.058 --> 35:27.930
And that he is, he knows that very well.
That he is that way one of the world leaders

35:28.131 --> 35:31.165
and we have Warren like that. Some of you
have come up like that,

35:31.366 --> 35:34.542
that anywhere in the whole world you can
go and do anything you like.

35:34.743 --> 35:38.799
Like I would say Rajesh is another one who
is coming up.

35:39.221 --> 35:46.010
But unless and until you make proper
arrangements

35:46.649 --> 35:50.014
you should not shift a person suddenly.
See, you should try

35:50.215 --> 35:55.733
to see that this person suddenly shifted
won’t be alright.

35:55.934 --> 36:00.387
But you must also find out if you really
want to shift

36:00.588 --> 36:03.520
a person or not. If you are uncertain,
better keep it hanging.

36:03.721 --> 36:06.843
You see, time is the best way to allow
things to happen like this, you see.

36:07.044 --> 36:10.219
Allow little time to pass away. Give
a little hint to a person,

36:10.420 --> 36:15.135
“You see, people are complaining. What
to do? I’d like you to help me out, like.”

36:15.336 --> 36:19.948
So that he also thinks that you’ve given
him the sufficient time to improve.

36:20.179 --> 36:22.805
You know, that way. But if you don’t give
any time

36:23.006 --> 36:29.328
and you just tell a person: “Now, you get
out!”, he’ll become your enemy.

36:29.529 --> 36:32.110
But, on the contrary, you should say,
“I’m sorry, but these people are such,

36:32.311 --> 36:37.165
they are trying to, you see, trouble us
and trouble me all the time,

36:37.366 --> 36:41.705
and I don’t know what’s wrong with them,
but, see, please take care and all that.”

36:41.884 --> 36:44.257
And things work out. People take it,
you see, they understand

36:44.458 --> 36:46.483
that you are responsible for yourself,

36:46.684 --> 36:50.206
and that I am putting that responsibility
on them.

36:50.407 --> 36:52.408
That is how it should be worked out.

36:52.584 --> 36:55.362
There’s a shop in Lucknow and he makes
very good sweets,

36:55.563 --> 36:59.022
very famous for its sweets, you see.
And now his father is gone

36:59.223 --> 37:03.050
but the son is sitting with his big stomach
he has got there, he is sitting there.

37:03.251 --> 37:06.644
And everybody goes there to his shop
to buy.

37:06.845 --> 37:09.559
And you cannot take a car; you have to walk
quite a long distance.

37:09.760 --> 37:12.451
Now his trick is such, which I have noticed
that.

37:12.652 --> 37:17.215
What he will do that he will take your
first order, then you said,

37:17.416 --> 37:22.433
“Alright, please this”. Then you are sitting
there. Then he’ll say, “What are you doing?

37:22.634 --> 37:26.019
Why don’t you give her things? She has
been sitting for such a long time.”

37:26.220 --> 37:30.179
He’ll tell Me: “Look at these people, you
see. They just go on taking

37:30.380 --> 37:34.851
so much time of people. Now I hope you
don’t have to go by the airplane just now.”

37:35.052 --> 37:39.232
I said, “No, no. I’m alright, it’s alright.”
So, on an apology all the time, you see.

37:39.433 --> 37:44.413
So then he’ll say: “Why not taste some of
these things I’ve made specially, just try.”

37:44.614 --> 37:47.177
So you eat something; “Alright, give me
this also more” -

37:47.378 --> 37:52.346
like that he goes on, you see, giving time.
And then, after some time,

37:52.547 --> 37:55.270
again he’ll say: “Oh now, look at these
people, how horrid they are.

37:55.486 --> 37:57.959
They don’t know how to finish the work.

37:58.160 --> 38:01.407
Hey! What are you doing there? Why don’t
you give some, Her sweets to the lady?

38:01.608 --> 38:03.879
She has to go now. Why are you taking
so much time?

38:04.080 --> 38:06.818
I’m sorry, but will you taste this till
then, they’ll bring it”.

38:07.019 --> 38:09.829
So he gives something else. So you say:
“Alright, give me this”.

38:10.030 --> 38:12.649
By the time you go from there all your
money is finished

38:12.850 --> 38:17.774
and you have bought all the sweets
of the shop! And that’s the trick he plays.

38:17.975 --> 38:21.210
And it’s - then after some time you
discover it that, and you say that,

38:21.411 --> 38:23.582
“I know all these tricks. Now, will you
please give Me whatever I want

38:23.783 --> 38:26.402
and I’ll leave!”

38:26.680 --> 38:30.868
So what I’m saying that a relationship
of sweetness and this thing develops

38:31.069 --> 38:36.562
when you see that a person how sweetly
he is selling his things, products to us.

38:36.763 --> 38:38.804
On the contrary: “This is my product.

38:39.005 --> 38:44.560
If you want you have it. Otherwise, get
out!” “Yes, alright, you get out first”.

38:45.734 --> 38:50.617
The whole attitude of selling is now
turning back

38:50.818 --> 38:55.352
to a proper relationship between the person
who wants to sell -

38:55.553 --> 38:58.399
seller - and the purchaser.

38:58.600 --> 39:01.388
It’s just the relationship that works, not
the product.

39:01.589 --> 39:06.223
Let the product go to hell! Nobody is
bothered about the product.

39:07.209 --> 39:09.852
Of course, I mean, if you just cheat them
is alright,

39:10.053 --> 39:14.691
but between A, B, C, D, E – if you have
five products,

39:14.892 --> 39:20.211
people will take - and they are equally
about the same, equally good -

39:20.412 --> 39:25.320
then people will go to the organization
which is sensible,

39:25.521 --> 39:28.610
which receives people sensibly, respects
them

39:28.811 --> 39:39.422
and delivers the thing in time, and a thing
that is not so useless.

39:39.623 --> 39:43.181
Of course, you must find out what is
the good in the other organizations,

39:43.382 --> 39:46.955
what they are having, and what they are
selling. You should find out.

39:47.156 --> 39:50.187
That is important. And why people like
that.

39:50.388 --> 39:53.782
But mostly I’ve seen what works out
is nothing

39:53.983 --> 39:57.524
but your relationship with the customer.

39:57.725 --> 40:01.192
But also your relationship in the office
should be good.

40:01.393 --> 40:05.062
That’s both the things should work out.
The relationship must be good.

40:05.270 --> 40:07.815
First of all your personality should be
good. I was telling him, you see,

40:08.016 --> 40:10.957
people who wear the fashionable dresses
in the office, you see,

40:11.158 --> 40:18.721
cannot be good administrators, cannot.
Because, you see, they become little loose,

40:18.922 --> 40:22.439
and people start taking advantage
of a loose personality.

40:22.640 --> 40:28.324
But you should be tight, in the sense -
wear an official dress, always, you know.

40:28.525 --> 40:31.017
People have an awe about that.

40:31.218 --> 40:34.632
I was telling him, supposing a cook wears,
a lady cook wears

40:34.833 --> 40:38.929
a swimming dress: no one will like it,
will they?

40:40.585 --> 40:45.932
In the same way, this new idea, like you
see now, in the offices

40:46.133 --> 40:52.694
people will call the… everybody, the driver
will call the boss: “Tom, how are you?”.

40:52.895 --> 40:56.714
Then no respect, it starts like that.

40:56.915 --> 40:59.534
Or if the boss takes, say, drugs or
something,

40:59.735 --> 41:03.450
like in India they take what you call
tobacco. Is a tobacco they eat.

41:03.651 --> 41:11.825
So what happens, that even a peon goes
to the boss

41:14.482 --> 41:18.970
and the boss says, “Have you got little
bit of …?”. “Yes, yes, yes.”

41:19.178 --> 41:21.845
So he takes out his own and gives it.
Finished!

41:22.046 --> 41:24.385
The whole relationship is finished.

41:24.586 --> 41:32.517
So at that time, if you’re taking drugs, if
you have – if you take drinks or anything,

41:32.718 --> 41:37.425
whatever habits you have are really
detrimental, but try to cut them.

41:37.626 --> 41:44.091
But even if you cannot, you do not expect
your subordinates to support that.

41:44.292 --> 41:48.202
No one likes cheap type of jokes and
things, but, you see, these subordinates

41:48.403 --> 41:50.739
they pass a cheap type of jokes and they
think they are popular.

41:50.940 --> 41:56.095
They are not. Popularity is to be gained
by aloofness

41:56.296 --> 42:00.092
and singleness. Not by just becoming
like them.

42:00.293 --> 42:04.867
Like, another incident I’ll give you that

42:05.068 --> 42:08.673
in CP’s office there was a lady who
came in a jeans, you see.

42:08.874 --> 42:13.438
And CP called her. He said, “Madam,
I will not have this.

42:13.639 --> 42:16.132
You can wear trousers, or you can wear
something, sensible dress,

42:16.333 --> 42:19.481
but not these jeans.” She said, “No,
but sir, now these days it’s good.”

42:19.682 --> 42:22.288
He said, “Yes, it’s alright. You can wear
it on the streets. You can wear it

42:22.489 --> 42:25.095
in the house. You can wear it anywhere –
but not in the office.”

42:25.296 --> 42:27.971
She said, “No sir, it cannot be so”.
He said, “Alright,

42:28.172 --> 42:32.258
then will you please resign. I won’t have
you.”

42:32.459 --> 42:34.169
Then she started wearing proper dresses.

42:34.370 --> 42:37.005
Because that really makes a difference,
you see.

42:37.206 --> 42:43.973
Always a dress makes a difference for
proper articulation.

42:44.174 --> 42:48.600
Absolutely you see that. Now, yesterday
I didn’t have a white sari. Just imagine!

42:48.801 --> 42:51.826
They never put any white saris for My
programme.

42:52.027 --> 42:54.867
So, I said: “Now, I always wear a white
sari for My programme”.

42:55.068 --> 43:00.073
But I had one, this one, the white with
the red border. It makes a difference.

43:00.274 --> 43:02.505
If I had worn some other sari it could
not happen.

43:02.706 --> 43:06.564
But supposing I am coming to see you, what
sari I wear has an effect on you.

43:06.772 --> 43:11.013
“Oh, Mother wore this sari while coming,
you see, just to meet us.”

43:11.214 --> 43:14.795
It’s like your light; you see, your dress,
your behaviour

43:14.996 --> 43:18.866
is like your light, whatever you are inside
shows out with that.

43:19.067 --> 43:21.827
And all these compromises that people
are having nowadays

43:22.028 --> 43:25.095
is spoiling the administration.

43:25.334 --> 43:29.199
You must keep to yourself; you must keep
to your position.

43:29.400 --> 43:35.636
Like, now there are, in the offices I’ve
seen, people answer back, you see.

43:35.837 --> 43:38.122
Your own people will sit down and answer
back.

43:38.323 --> 43:41.873
But if you see a Japanese firm, one person
will speak, nobody else.

43:42.081 --> 43:44.947
They’ll all sit tight. When this one person
asks him a question,

43:45.148 --> 43:46.990
he says, otherwise he doesn’t speak.

43:47.198 --> 43:51.659
A kind of an absolutely unison exists
between them.

43:51.860 --> 43:56.021
Now what they do – the trick is like this –
before going to any programme

43:56.222 --> 43:58.047
and all that, he’ll call all his five
people,

43:58.248 --> 44:00.246
“This is what we are going to discuss
there.

44:00.447 --> 44:03.290
Now you have to say this and you have
to say this.

44:03.491 --> 44:05.158
And when I ask you this, you have
to say this.”

44:05.359 --> 44:08.912
It’s already decided. Nobody is free
to talk in the presence of others.

44:09.113 --> 44:11.490
All the freedom is before, you see, before
going.

44:11.691 --> 44:14.180
We do the same with our children. When
Indians have to go

44:14.381 --> 44:18.077
to somebody’s house, now, they’ll tell
the children, “When you go there,

44:18.278 --> 44:22.127
you are not to ask for anything. You should
not touch anything there.

44:22.328 --> 44:27.729
You are not to eat much. I’ll say no
to that.

44:27.930 --> 44:30.073
And even if you have to eat, take very
little.

44:30.274 --> 44:33.195
And then, before going, you must say;
“Thank you”.

44:33.396 --> 44:35.531
When you go there you must say, “Namaskar.”

44:35.732 --> 44:37.780
All these things are taught in the house,
first of all.

44:37.981 --> 44:41.653
“Otherwise next time we’ll not take you!”

44:45.996 --> 44:49.942
So by that thing, you see, what happens
that they are already warned.

44:50.143 --> 44:51.874
Actually they are knowledgeable what to do.

44:52.075 --> 44:55.262
Supposing you take five people, come along
for a meeting, sit down there.

44:55.463 --> 45:00.047
Then they start arguing among themselves,
in the same organization they do.

45:00.248 --> 45:02.383
Now, for example, now, Sahaja Yogis

45:02.584 --> 45:04.942
in the beginning used to do the same.
I have seen that.

45:05.134 --> 45:07.928
They would argue with Me in the presence
of others and it created a problem.

45:08.129 --> 45:12.321
So I had to tell them: “Now in the presence
of others don’t argue.

45:16.465 --> 45:19.052
If you want to tell Me, you tell Me”.

45:19.220 --> 45:24.270
And between them to create a good feeling,
you see, no sense of jealousies or anything.

45:24.471 --> 45:27.933
The jealousy is another thing that plays
very much among your own people.

45:28.134 --> 45:30.594
So you just have to tell that, “Everybody
has their own job.

45:30.795 --> 45:33.737
Everything has to be done, and is to be
done well –

45:33.938 --> 45:35.990
and we are all together; we are one.

45:36.214 --> 45:39.407
There’s no question of having this hand
having a jealousy with this hand,

45:39.608 --> 45:41.544
but you are on the left hand, you are
on the right hand. Alright,

45:41.745 --> 45:43.988
do your right-hand work and you do your
left-hand work

45:44.189 --> 45:46.958
and the whole thing will work out.
The whole organization has to come up.

45:47.159 --> 45:50.240
If the organization goes up, we’ll all get
the advantages.”

45:50.441 --> 45:56.215
So always build them up into a unison
as far the organization is concerned.

45:56.416 --> 46:04.121
“If we all work out well, if we have more
profits, we’ll have better bonuses”.

46:04.367 --> 46:07.121
So…
[Tape interruption]

46:07.322 --> 46:13.883
…innately perhaps maybe I understand
your Kundalinis very well.

46:14.084 --> 46:18.956
Innately I know how to deal with people;
innately.

46:19.157 --> 46:22.294
Now, sometimes you have to say about
someone –

46:22.495 --> 46:27.901
say, I may say about you to him, that, you
see, “Look after him and do this and…”

46:28.102 --> 46:30.443
Maybe he is rather careless. He won’t
understand

46:30.644 --> 46:33.623
what I’ve told and he might just say,
“Mother was saying so!”

46:33.824 --> 46:37.213
So I have to warn him: “You just say
yourself.

46:37.414 --> 46:39.192
Otherwise it won’t have any effect.

46:39.393 --> 46:44.266
If I have to tell him, I can tell him
directly. Why I’m telling you?”

46:45.086 --> 46:48.598
But all these things must be made clear
before he speaks.

46:48.799 --> 46:52.566
Because once he’s done it, then what’s
the use?

46:52.767 --> 46:55.075
Then, if he comes to your explanation
to you,

46:55.276 --> 47:00.086
you should be prepared to say, tell him
why you had to tell him,

47:00.287 --> 47:04.220
and I didn’t tell you directly. So that
the another person who has tried

47:04.421 --> 47:10.206
to be stupid is put into his own place;
and your relations remain alright.

47:10.407 --> 47:16.926
So relationships are to be maintained good
by your own dignity,

47:17.127 --> 47:23.033
your own sense of respect of yourself,
and the respect of others.

47:23.234 --> 47:25.309
You see, as you treat yourself, you treat
others.

47:25.510 --> 47:30.503
But first you have no respect for yourself,
how can you respect others?

47:30.997 --> 47:33.881
And I personally think that, you see,
this fashion business -

47:34.082 --> 47:38.175
that this is very fashionable, that is very
fashionable - is a beggarish stuff.

47:38.376 --> 47:43.526
You see, it’s beggarish. Is the beggars
who create the fashion in democracy.

47:43.727 --> 47:46.696
Democratic countries, you see, another
I’ve found out,

47:46.897 --> 47:52.604
is a left-sided stuff. And when they create
a fashion, what happens?

47:52.805 --> 47:56.468
That, say, there are ten beggars who have
nothing,

47:56.669 --> 47:59.510
so what - the ten people start wearing
a dress like that,

47:59.711 --> 48:02.767
and even a rich man will start behaving
like that.

48:02.968 --> 48:05.874
So, it is in the same way, there are ten
stupid fools, you see,

48:06.075 --> 48:08.230
idiots, they behave like idiots,

48:08.431 --> 48:11.697
so even an intelligent man thinks something
wrong with him.

48:11.898 --> 48:14.590
So in a democracy you have to be like
the rest of them,

48:14.791 --> 48:18.975
so you start behaving like an idiot.
Yes, it’s true!

48:19.176 --> 48:24.568
I mean, like I have seen some very senior
people, sensible people

48:24.769 --> 48:28.802
cracking very dirty jokes. And the reason
is, you see, when they came to England

48:29.003 --> 48:31.912
they found everybody talking like that.

48:32.089 --> 48:35.130
So they thought: “Am I something different
with me? Oh, I’m also like you.”

48:35.331 --> 48:39.670
So they will crack a joke. So they stoop
down, you see.

48:39.878 --> 48:43.623
You don’t have to stoop down, you have
to rise higher to attract them.

48:43.824 --> 48:47.492
This is the difference: to stoop down
to their level or to rise higher.

48:47.693 --> 48:50.996
But, while rising higher, you should not
suggest that you are rising higher,

48:51.197 --> 48:56.406
create any jealousy, or kind of a feeling
that this one thinks no end of himself.

48:56.647 --> 49:01.932
But in a very gentle manner you should
show that you are higher than them;

49:02.164 --> 49:04.510
then only they will follow you. Otherwise
they will not.

49:04.711 --> 49:08.780
If you are lower than them, or of their
style, how, why will they follow?

49:08.981 --> 49:12.190
Many people do these things, I mean,
such a common thing in the West;

49:12.391 --> 49:15.804
see, they have lost their sense at all.
But in other countries, like say,

49:16.005 --> 49:18.022
any country which is a fascist country,

49:18.223 --> 49:21.080
or a, say, a Communist country, where
they are right-sided,

49:21.281 --> 49:24.068
what they do, they build up their own
images.

49:24.269 --> 49:27.319
I would say, even in Japan is the same.
They have their own images.

49:27.520 --> 49:30.074
The leader is a leader, you see, you
cannot talk to him.

49:30.275 --> 49:33.110
If you have to talk to him, you have
to talk in this manner;

49:33.311 --> 49:37.606
there’s a system of that kind, and you
cannot behave like this.

49:37.807 --> 49:42.365
But the leader himself has a projection
of a personality,

49:42.566 --> 49:45.669
where he treats everyone like a father,
father.

49:45.870 --> 49:47.490
But here the father behaves like a child.

49:47.691 --> 49:50.745
The child comes and says: “I want some
drink.”

49:50.946 --> 49:54.799
So the father pours some whisky and gives
it to his son. Finished!

49:55.000 --> 49:57.191
That relationship is finished.

49:57.399 --> 50:03.267
As soon as you try to come to the level
of your child - is finished.

50:03.849 --> 50:08.257
They must know, there should be an awe.
That’s a part you have to play.

50:08.458 --> 50:11.548
You should be very friendly, you should be
kind, you should be everything.

50:11.749 --> 50:13.892
But you must know you are a father
out and out.

50:14.093 --> 50:15.560
Otherwise children will never respect you.

50:15.761 --> 50:18.885
In the same way, in any organization
it happens.

50:19.086 --> 50:22.098
You must keep that distance. For example,

50:22.299 --> 50:26.078
I would never like anybody to call Me
by name, at all, never.

50:26.279 --> 50:31.497
But in the office or something I don’t like
someone to call Me by name,

50:31.698 --> 50:39.179
so I’ll call others, say, in an office or so,
I’ll say ‘Mister’.

50:39.380 --> 50:45.104
CP’s driver also I’ll say ‘Mister’ to him.
So he dare not call Me by name.

50:47.969 --> 50:53.811
Yogi: Yes, at school it’s become a fashion
that the students call me with my name.

50:54.012 --> 51:00.296
Shri Mataji: That’s it! They have no
respect. They have no respect.

51:01.689 --> 51:04.428
Yogi: All teachers, I mean.

51:09.833 --> 51:14.636
Yogi 2: Shall I go and take a look
downstairs and see whether the bell…

51:14.837 --> 51:18.148
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon? Is there
somebody who has come?

51:18.349 --> 51:21.344
Yogi 2: Well, I heard the bell ringing.
Shri Mataji: Alright, go and have a look.

51:21.545 --> 51:24.585
Then I’ll go and see. It’s eleven o’clock
now, exactly.

51:24.786 --> 51:27.886
Now let Gregoire listen to the first part
of it.

51:28.087 --> 51:29.325
Let’s see what he has to say.
