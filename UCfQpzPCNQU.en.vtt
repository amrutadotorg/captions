WEBVTT

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.799
So now you can take off your shoes comfortably

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:08.639
People sitting on chairs, also remove their shoes

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.040
keep two feet apart, those who are sitting on the ground

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.599
That's the best.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.449
[Music]

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.519
OK, now remember my three conditions

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.359
and don't forget them.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.520
Now, first of all, we will

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.640
show you how you can

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.920
awaken your Kundali

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.920
In what way

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.640
So now I am also showing it to you

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.200
and I am also telling you that our

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.159
left hand toward me

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.479
now left hand, is left side

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.400
is the power of desire

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.560
power of desire

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.079
when you put your hands like this, it means

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:35.360
.

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:41.040
You have said, I wish that

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.040
Mother gives me Self-realization

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.320
Keep it like this all the time and the right hand

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.399
is the power of action, with this we can fix our chakras.

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.880
is the power of action, That's how we get our

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.719
energy centres corrected

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.840
So first of all we should place our right hand

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.399
on our heart.

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.720
I told you about the spirit is the heart

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.479
is the refelction

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.879
After that we place our hand

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.480
on the upper part of the stomach

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.760
we keep working on our work left side,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.599
this is the place of our Guru

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.879
-

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.040
Meaning, the great teachers have

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.200
created this Chakra for us and

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.720
by it awakening , you become your own Guru.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.319
Then place your hand on the lower part

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:53.840
of your stomach,

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.440
left hand side

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.800
Then take this

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.239
hand up and again

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.879
to the left hand side

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:15.840
Place it in the upper abdomen,

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.840
(stomach area)

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.840
Now again over the heart

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:30.000
Now place your hand at the angle

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.680
between your neck and your shoulder

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.560
Keep the angle as far back as you can

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.400
and turn the neck to the right side

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.280
I just told you when this centre

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.480
get caught up,and what diseases occurs.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.560
Now, hold your right hand completely.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:00.079
in a horizontal position like this

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.159
on your forehead

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:07.560
and bend your neck down fully.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.760
This

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.680
centre

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:28.759
is to forgive all.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.560
Now place your right hand on the back of

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.560
your head

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.960
and turn your head backwards,

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.280
as far as you can

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.960
Here

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.759
by not blaming yourself,

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:56.520
and not counting your mistakes

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.840
For your own satisfaction you should say,

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.120
O God, If I have made a mistakes please forgive me',

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.960
this will happen later,

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.160
These centre is for this purpose.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:19.080
Now open your hand fully,

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.479
and the middle part of the palm should be evenly

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:27.520
placed on the palate of your head

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.319
-

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:32.120
And

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.440
it is very important, to pull your fingers out to press it completely

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.319
It is very important to pull it out and

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:44.800
place in on the palate of the head and fingers pointing outwards

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.800
Pull out completely and

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.759
bow down your head completely

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:54.039
-

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.639
Now you put full pressure

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:04.800
of your hand

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.160
Rotate it in this way

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.240
on the scalp of your head

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.160
It will rotate

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.880
like the hands of a clock

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.120
Rotate it in the same direction as the hands of a clock

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:27.199
7 times; done;

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.280
That's all you have to do, now

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.160
If you have glasses then take them out because now

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.599
You have to close your eyes and if something is tight

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:58.400
on your stomach or neck then

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.360
loosen it a little.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.319
And everybody

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:05.960
should do it fully

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:14.360
Again I repeat, with pleasent mind

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.680
do it

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:25.560
Now close your eyes and do not open any of them.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.440
Close your eyes and

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.520
put your hand on your heart.

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:37.080
Now ask a question to yourself in your heart

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.599
ask me

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.759
You may call me Shri Mataji,

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:49.039
Or say Mother

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:53.919
You ask the question

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:58.039
Mother, am I the spirit?' ask the question three times

00:07:58.039 --> 00:08:01.039
Ask

00:08:06.039 --> 00:08:09.560
This is a very basic question.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.440
Now you

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.719
must know that if you the pure spirit, then you

00:08:35.719 --> 00:08:39.399
also become your own Guru

00:08:39.399 --> 00:08:41.880
Because in the light of your spirit

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.040
you become

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:48.959
your own Guru, so please put your

00:08:48.959 --> 00:08:52.200
right hand on the upper part of the stomach

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.839
the left hand on the side

00:08:54.839 --> 00:08:57.560
Press it with your fingers.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.080
these guru principle;

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.399
music

00:09:01.399 --> 00:09:03.520
Now ask me the second question here

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.809
music

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:11.519
Mother, am I my own Guru?'

00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:16.040
Mother, am I my own guru?'

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.680
Am I my own master?

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.399
Ask me these question three times

00:09:23.399 --> 00:09:26.640
In your mind

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.079
Now you put your right hand

00:09:57.839 --> 00:10:01.440
on the lower part of the stomach, on your

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.839
Left side

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.480
put

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.519
And know that

00:10:08.519 --> 00:10:12.720
I respect your freedom

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.320
fully.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.680
And I cannot force these

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.720
pure knowledge upon you

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.000
The pure knowledge

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.800
from this Chakra will give you

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:35.040
complete knowledge of the power of God

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:38.399
So here you have to say

00:10:38.399 --> 00:10:41.800
this six times

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.959
because this chakra has six petals.

00:10:45.959 --> 00:10:50.440
You have to ask in your heart

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:55.079
Shri Mataji please give me pure knowledge'

00:10:55.079 --> 00:10:58.079
-

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.800
Now

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.200
You press your

00:11:27.079 --> 00:11:31.240
hands a little harder

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:42.079
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge,

00:11:42.079 --> 00:11:46.279
the awakening of Kundalini begins

00:11:46.279 --> 00:11:47.920
-

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.079
But for that we will have to

00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:54.279
open the upper chakras.

00:11:54.279 --> 00:11:59.440
Now raise your right hand and place it on your stomach.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:04.000
Keep it in the upper left side

00:12:08.079 --> 00:12:13.760
and with full confidence

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.480
The chakras will open only with confidence

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:22.320
With full confidence you say

00:12:22.959 --> 00:12:26.560
Mother

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.000
I am my own Guru'

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.320
With full confidence say

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.839
10 times

00:12:42.839 --> 00:12:45.880
10 times

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:50.279
say it 10 times

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.000
I have already told you

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.279
that you are a spirit.

00:13:12.279 --> 00:13:19.480
You are not a body, intellect, mind, ego, etc.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.600
But you are a pure spirit

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:29.560
Now place your right hand on your heart

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:33.760
And with full faith

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.839
say this 12 times

00:13:36.839 --> 00:13:40.920
Shri Mataji

00:13:41.079 --> 00:13:44.199
I am a pure spirit

00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:49.560
Mother, I am a pure spirit

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.800
Say it in your own language, in whatever language

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.199
you want to say it,

00:13:56.839 --> 00:14:01.040
say it 12 times

00:14:16.759 --> 00:14:20.440
Now I will say one thing again that

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:25.040
you are not guilty, you are not a sinner

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:31.040
do not bring down yourself to the lowest level

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.399
You are human

00:14:34.399 --> 00:14:39.519
and you are glorious

00:14:47.639 --> 00:14:53.279
This love of God is spread all around

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:59.800
he is the ocean of forgiveness

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:03.320
We can't make any mistake that

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.759
this ocean

00:15:05.759 --> 00:15:09.519
cannot destroy

00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:13.079
So forgive yourself and

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:14.959
your right hand

00:15:14.959 --> 00:15:19.000
between your shoulder and your neck

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.480
in the middle

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:26.600
And turn your neck completely to the right side

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.240
turn it

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.959
Here

00:15:30.959 --> 00:15:35.319
you have to say 16 times

00:15:35.319 --> 00:15:38.959
Mother, I am not guilty at all '

00:15:38.959 --> 00:15:43.040
I am innocent say it 16 times with full

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.160
Say with faith I say that

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.759
You are innocent

00:16:04.639 --> 00:16:08.600
say it again, if you forgive others

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.639
you don't do anything

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:15.839
If you do not forgive, you play in

00:16:15.839 --> 00:16:18.560
wrong hands

00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:24.120
therfore

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:29.959
Forgive all of them together, your

00:16:29.959 --> 00:16:31.480
right hand

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:36.560
Place it horizontally across your forehead

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:41.680
Press on both sides and bend your neck down

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.399
And here

00:16:48.639 --> 00:16:51.680
I say it with full confidence

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:56.600
Mother, I have forgiven all, together

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.000
-

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.199
I, together

00:17:01.199 --> 00:17:03.679
forgiven all together

00:17:03.679 --> 00:17:06.880
how many times you say, not important

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.079
must say it from the heart

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:14.679
Mother, I forgiven everyone.

00:17:21.959 --> 00:17:25.839
Now take your right hand back

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:29.839
and

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.960
bend your head back

00:17:34.559 --> 00:17:37.480
This is the place

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.720
For your satisfaction

00:17:42.039 --> 00:17:46.480
without blaming yourself or counting your mistakes

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:51.000
for your own satisfaction

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.919
You have to say it with your heart

00:17:56.919 --> 00:17:59.600
-

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.960
O God, if I have committed any mistake

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.960
knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:12.400
Say this from your heart, it is does not a matter

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.799
how many times you say it

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:23.919
Now the last chakra is very important

00:18:23.919 --> 00:18:27.080
Keep your left hand and both feet apart

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.799
those who are sitting on the floor, should remain seated comfortably,

00:18:29.799 --> 00:18:34.799
but now spread their hands properly

00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:38.919
Stretch your palm fully, and then

00:18:38.919 --> 00:18:41.440
in the middle,

00:18:42.679 --> 00:18:45.240
the area

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.679
you should put it on your palate, which is your

00:18:49.679 --> 00:18:53.799
In my childhood, had a very soft bone (fontenel bone)

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:54.520
Place it on it

00:18:54.520 --> 00:19:01.159
and bend your neck completely

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:06.320
open your fingers, completely

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:10.760
stretch it outward

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:15.520
on your scalp and on the skin

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.840
of your scalp

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.240
Now know that

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.159
-

00:19:23.159 --> 00:19:24.799
-

00:19:24.799 --> 00:19:27.080
I respect your freedom

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:32.480
And I can't force self-realization on you.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:37.520
Now you have to ask

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:41.799
Please move this hand slowly seven times

00:19:41.799 --> 00:19:45.679
Clockwise means slowly like the hands of a clock

00:19:45.679 --> 00:19:50.280
Rotate and say Mother, seven times

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:54.720
Please give me my self realization'

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:59.799
Please give me self realization Mother, please give me self realization

00:19:59.799 --> 00:20:02.120
Realization

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:07.720
do it seven times

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:23.299
[music]

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.680
[music]

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:48.979
[music]

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:56.180
[music]

00:20:56.799 --> 00:21:00.600
Now slowly turn your eyes

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:07.080
Now turn both your hands towards me like this

00:21:07.159 --> 00:21:11.039
And look at me

00:21:11.039 --> 00:21:14.120
And become thoughtless

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:17.880
Don't think

00:21:21.559 --> 00:21:25.880
Now move your right hand a little forward and bow your head

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:29.679
See if there is any cool or warm air coming from

00:21:29.679 --> 00:21:34.039
above your head

00:21:34.039 --> 00:21:37.760
put your hand, don't touch it, feel it from far

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.679
For some,the breeze comes from quiet far

00:21:40.679 --> 00:21:46.720
See the cold breeze coming from your head?

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:52.320
put your right hand towards me, your right hand,

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.679
check with your left hand, first your right hand

00:21:55.679 --> 00:21:59.279
towards me, now with your left hand

00:21:59.279 --> 00:22:01.960
right hand toward me and do it and check with your left hand

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:07.559
Look, is it's coming, on your left hand

00:22:07.799 --> 00:22:11.200
Now bend your neck and check with your right hand

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:16.559
is is coming? everybody check

00:22:18.279 --> 00:22:21.520
ask me a question, Mother,

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.640
is this the supreme consciousness?

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.760
Is this the power of God's love?

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.559
Ask any one of question three times

00:22:30.559 --> 00:22:36.640
push your neck up toward the sky

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:45.279
bring it down

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.640
keep your hands like this

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:53.000
All those people ,

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.400
who feel cold or hot air coming from top of the head or the palm or fingers

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:03.679
All those people put your hand

00:23:03.679 --> 00:23:06.039
put up,

00:23:08.039 --> 00:23:12.440
whole of Hyderabad has got realised

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.480

Infinite Blessings
