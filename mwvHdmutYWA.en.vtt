00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.880
Now don’t have diffidence.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.760
First of all, you should not think that, “We are very ordinary people.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.160
We are very ordinary. We haven’t got something special about it.”

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.720
This work is not going to be done by special people

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.680
because they are suffering from ego.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.440
It is going to be done by people who don’t have that ego

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:34.360
of great success or of great achievements or riches or anything.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.680
If they are rid of this, then only they can work it out.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.280
And that’s why it is for you to understand what Christ has said

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:54.840
that a camel can pass through the hole of a needle, but not a rich man.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.600
Because the ego is too big, bigger than a camel, bigger than an elephant,

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.360
any animal you could think of.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.240
That’s why now as we are entering into new awareness,

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.400
let us not worry about our negative thinking.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.320
So, first is the diffidence: “How can I be? I am not all right.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.640
I was like this. I was doing like this. I had done like this.”

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.560
So many letters of confessions come to me,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.680
pages after pages, which I throw away or burn them off.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.200
There is no need to confess any more. There’s only one confession,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.440
that “I am a sahaja yogi and now, after twenty-first of Sahasrara,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.800
I am a Maha Yogi.”

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.760
This is the confession you have to make.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.960
And no more of all these out-of-date things that people tell me

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.960
about your family’s life and all mundane, nonsensical things.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.560
We have given them up and we have come to Sahaja Yoga for our ascent.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.680
We have achieved our ascent and now for what? For what?

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.160
Have achieved our ascent is to emancipate human beings,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.360
to help them out of the mire of ignorance, of darkness.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:28.320
The main target, I feel today, should not be so much political as fundamentalism.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.600
So we have to openly say to these fundamentalists

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.840
that, “You are nonsensical. You don’t know the truth.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.600
You don’t know anything about truth. You don’t know that you are the Spirit.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.880
You don’t know that there is a power that is working.”

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.720
You have to tell them very clearly, “You are all stupid people

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.760
running after something that is a mirage

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.120
and all of you will end up into hell as described by all the scriptures.”

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.960
We have to openly say it, this thing.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.880
Whichever way you like, you may write books.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.680
You may publish it. You may tell people about it.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.680
But now the new announcement has to come to say

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.680
that running after falsehood is not going to take you to God.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.240
And, in that, they have used the power of hatred.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.160
So you have to say that, “We believe in the power of love

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.400
and not in the power of hatred that you believe in.”

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.360
For us, everybody is capable of finding the Truth

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:34.360
and is capable of getting to the heaven of that paradise,

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.680
which is promised to us, the Kingdom of God.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.360
So, for us, everybody, whether they belong to this community, that community,

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.880
this race or that race, whatever it is, we believe –

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.720
not that – but we are sure, that we all are quite capable

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.880
and blessed by God, that we should enter into His Kingdom.
