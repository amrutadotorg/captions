00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.080
[Music]

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.340
you

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.960
[Music]

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:22.630
many times the symbol of Lakshmi was

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:30.980
created really beautifully and it was so

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:38.500
that she came out of the water through

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:38.500
the water she came out so cleaned and

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:49.300
she has no pride

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:53.510
she doesn't assert herself she doesn't

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.040
put her pressure on others but human

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.519
beings are just opposite if they have

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:01.250
money they ride on a horse all the time

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:07.940
they cannot come down is impossible to

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:10.640
talk to them so a person who is money is

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:14.000
not a one who is worshiping it actually

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.100
she stands on a lotus that she takes all

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.130
her weight within herself in the same

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:24.980
way we have to suck in all the weight of

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:30.470
money weight of your positions weight of

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:33.130
your so-called education weight of some

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.980
aristocratic family you are born off

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:43.940
this is all nonsense which makes you a

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:49.160
heavy person to go down very fast so she

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:51.680
stands her fruits in a way on the Lotus

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:57.440
and what a thing is beautiful is Lotus

00:01:51.680 --> 00:02:01.330
that she doesn't disturb any petals of

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:05.090
the lotus nothing she just stands

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:09.379
peacefully in a balance her center of

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:13.310
gravity is so balanced that she cannot

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:16.550
topple down you must be grounded in the

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:21.290
mother earth into the practical side of

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:24.499
it it's nothing something we are hanging

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:28.110
in the air but we are grounded in the

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:30.860
mother earth and a slightest thing happy

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.260
to us again we come back to our balance

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:38.550
so this is her position when she stands

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:42.120
up in the Lotus now she has a hand one

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.890
hand like this one hand like this their

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.410
two hands which have got again the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.110
lotuses the Penguins yesterday you saw

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:53.130
the pink pink is her fragrance I think

00:02:49.110 --> 00:03:00.840
is spread on the sky her nature is pink

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:06.150
pink is inviting is loving she is a very

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:10.950
fond hostess that she wants everybody to

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:13.920
come in in her house but if you see a

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.280
rich man he'll have ten dogs outside and

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.780
nobody can come inside the house so the

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.060
house is closed the doors are closed

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:26.520
everything closed money is closed

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:28.650
permanently so such a person cannot be

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:33.170
called as Lakshmi buddy he's not

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:37.610
eligible because he must have a cozy

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:41.390
beautiful cozy again I say cozy house

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:45.150
cause he doesn't mean like a hospital

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:48.750
anything drops if he frightened oh my

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.630
god let me pick it up cause he means

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:55.019
where you are comfortable it's all right

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.390
may I have to be not to this extreme or

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:03.810
that extreme but something that will

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:05.580
give joy to others to visitors to people

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.959
who come to your house you soothe the

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:13.950
sick people should feel happy to come to

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:17.600
your house so there's no showing off not

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.090
to show but to make them comfortable and

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:25.050
very happy

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:27.690
so the basic subtle point is that that

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:32.370
with your love you are encouraging

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:35.130
everyone you are helping everyone you

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:40.410
are creating a confidence in him his

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:41.540
personality and a kind of a report which

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.190
is very

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:47.250
you are not there to point out the bad

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.800
points but you are there to cover all

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:53.640
the bad points all the loopholes with

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.810
your love that's your job and there you

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.520
have to be honest

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:01.530
the honesty is for yourself not for us

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.470
keep that honesty to yourself because

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.390
maybe is rational and maybe that it is

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.020
just a matter of habit that you are

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:12.390
trying to hurt others so first check on

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.040
your mind and find out if you are trying

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.050
to hurt others or you are trying to

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.780
please others otherwise don't talk just

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.220
keep quiet if you are going to say

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.820
something to please others talk

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:27.210
otherwise just don't talk and you'll be

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:32.220
surprised when you say nice things to

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:36.240
other how nice this comes to you now

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:38.520
another thing is that the suggestion is

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:42.750
of the left hand is like this mitch is

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:45.030
giving a person was money must give but

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:48.180
so secretly that this hand should not

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:52.110
know is so far away this one this hand

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:54.270
should give just security sometimes it's

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.250
difficult to give money to anyone I find

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:59.730
it difficult because I find it that

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:02.940
people will not like it so that is a way

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:06.450
of giving there are so sweet ways of

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:09.780
giving just try to notice what that

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:14.520
person likes so there should be a

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:18.090
feeling of giving at the right time at

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.100
the best abortion moment that is also

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:22.620
one thing just like a camera man knows

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.810
when to click in the same way you must

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:28.520
know where to click when giving is

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:32.100
concerned it should not be sensational

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:35.580
but it should be elevating and that

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:38.240
helps the person because whatever you

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:42.960
give for spiritual growth is the one

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:45.890
that is them best thing that you can

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:48.390
give to anyone even in material things

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:50.460
there are so many ways if you want to

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:53.490
think about it of giving someone

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:58.590
something that spiritually he feels

00:06:53.490 --> 00:07:00.840
for today he feels happy and joyous for

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:04.710
sahaja Yogi's is very easy to handle

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:07.910
their money with respect to I have

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:12.509
something it should have a value behind

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:17.310
that is the Dharma part anything that

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:22.560
has an artistic value or some special

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:28.229
work then you should buy them you want

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:31.250
to give to something to others then the

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:36.650
feelings you have in your heart is the

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:39.030
value and that value is the real luxury

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:44.460
so if your Lakshmi

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:51.150
they say this much once you add to each

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:56.610
value it becomes so the another hand is

00:07:51.150 --> 00:08:01.889
like this this hand is shown that you

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:04.320
have to protect you have to protect we

00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:06.690
have to protect our children we have to

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:10.080
protect our wives we have to protect our

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:13.320
husbands whatever is good whatever is

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:15.349
beautiful produced created by a one even

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:19.590
by a child must be protected

00:08:15.349 --> 00:08:21.419
you must have feelings for them so what

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:26.400
we have to protect here is the goodness

00:08:21.419 --> 00:08:29.669
is the peace you must protect a person

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:32.729
who's virtuous very important but you

00:08:29.669 --> 00:08:34.380
must see things you must be informed

00:08:32.729 --> 00:08:36.839
when informed specially the ladies must

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:38.880
be very very involved it is very

00:08:36.839 --> 00:08:41.190
important because what I find ladies in

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.750
sahaja yoga they come they just jump in

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:44.790
the scene finish that that's not the way

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:47.190
you must learn how to swim you must know

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:50.940
how to make others also to save to

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:52.200
protect them you must know everything

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.910
that's going on in this world where you

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.920
are born you have to put your attention

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:58.589
to all these things especially the women

00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:01.010
must know their chakras their Shakti is

00:08:58.589 --> 00:09:04.790
of love of attention

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:04.790
so this protect you

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:15.329
speciality has to be with us the sign of

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:18.810
a person who is Laxmi potty is this you

00:09:15.329 --> 00:09:24.660
should have a house like the Lotus in

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:28.069
the hands of the goddess he should

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:34.160
protect people who are depending on him

00:09:28.069 --> 00:09:34.160
and from the left hand he should give

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:41.870
this is the image of the Lakshmi

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:46.970
this is what the Lakshmi is within you

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:51.060
if you have these four things in balance

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:55.110
without conditioning without evil then

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:59.459
you are a sahaja yoga otherwise you are

00:09:55.110 --> 00:10:02.040
not so this is the beauty of sahaja Yoga

00:09:59.459 --> 00:10:04.100
is that you become really a great

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:09.540
personality

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:13.139
but it's not the end of it this is only

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:22.470
the Lakshmi principle I told when in a

00:10:13.139 --> 00:10:26.009
human being the desire to rise higher

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:28.740
comes in the Lakshmi principle becomes

00:10:26.009 --> 00:10:31.290
the Mahalakshmi principle in the

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:35.550
awareness it acts on the matter like

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:39.029
aesthetics people worry moreover about

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:42.480
aesthetics then about possessions and

00:10:39.029 --> 00:10:45.290
when they start growing higher and

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:53.339
higher in their awareness of seeking

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:59.149
then they find that the attention should

00:10:53.339 --> 00:11:02.100
be such that they should pay more

00:10:59.149 --> 00:11:09.269
importance to the aesthetics of things

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:13.380
than to the gross gross values now when

00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:17.550
this desire becomes evident in the human

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:18.760
beings then only Lakshmi incarnate as

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:22.900
Mahalakshmi

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:26.140
thus the mahalakshmi's greatest weakness

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:30.130
is that through her power only the

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:33.010
sushumna is covered by Kundalini she's

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:36.100
the power of our evolution and by her

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:38.920
power only we have risen to be human

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:42.130
beings she looks after all our

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:46.090
well-being she's the one who looks after

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:49.150
all of our problems of redemption she's

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:51.340
the one who gives us all the possible

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:54.850
help in our chakras and correction of

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:59.290
them and she's the one who gives us all

00:11:54.850 --> 00:12:02.230
that is material or physical well-being

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:04.210
she's the one who relates us to abrade

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:08.260
the whole brain system is Mahalakshmi

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:13.600
system so it is she who exposes the

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:15.850
whole of the knowledge as truth to us on

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:18.280
our central nervous system in the sense

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:21.580
she's the bridge but the kundalini rises

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:24.970
over the bridge so she's the Redeemer

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:28.060
and she connects you to God once this

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:30.850
Lakshmi principle covers you up then the

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:35.320
Mahalakshmi principle starts is that you

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:38.050
think of the world as a great challenge

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:41.380
to you that you have to give them Hashmi

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:43.930
principle that you have to give them

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:46.720
realization you have to raise them up

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:49.660
and this principle one starts working in

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:55.360
the biological principle then all the

00:12:49.660 --> 00:13:00.040
problems are your own you have to start

00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:04.630
working it up so out of the Lakshmi

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:07.320
principle I hope you get all the chakras

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:11.140
all the principles satisfied in you

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:14.230
fully and also the Mahalakshmi principle

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:17.190
flows through your being you have to be

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:19.600
very satisfied I am comfortable people

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:20.950
it should be a personality which is

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.380
above everything else

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:25.600
such a beautiful personality you should

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:29.380
have is the depth of the sea and the

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:32.050
height of the colossal smile actually

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:34.450
principle when it is awakened within you

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:36.790
then you get out of a Lakshmi principle

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:39.910
which makes you little selfish maybe

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:45.100
self-centered and you get into a new

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:48.540
dimension of searching of searching the

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:51.899
higher very system something beyond

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:54.910
without any limitations and that

00:13:51.899 --> 00:13:57.490
Mahalakshmi principle is really nothing

00:13:54.910 --> 00:14:00.850
