00:00.000 --> 00:11.080
[Music]

00:12.960 --> 00:15.340
you

00:13.810 --> 00:17.960
[Music]

00:15.340 --> 00:22.630
many times the symbol of Lakshmi was

00:17.960 --> 00:30.980
created really beautifully and it was so

00:22.630 --> 00:38.500
that she came out of the water through

00:30.980 --> 00:38.500
the water she came out so cleaned and

00:39.070 --> 00:49.300
she has no pride

00:46.030 --> 00:53.510
she doesn't assert herself she doesn't

00:49.300 --> 00:55.040
put her pressure on others but human

00:53.510 --> 00:58.519
beings are just opposite if they have

00:55.040 --> 01:01.250
money they ride on a horse all the time

00:58.519 --> 01:07.940
they cannot come down is impossible to

01:01.250 --> 01:10.640
talk to them so a person who is money is

01:07.940 --> 01:14.000
not a one who is worshiping it actually

01:10.640 --> 01:16.100
she stands on a lotus that she takes all

01:14.000 --> 01:19.130
her weight within herself in the same

01:16.100 --> 01:24.980
way we have to suck in all the weight of

01:19.130 --> 01:30.470
money weight of your positions weight of

01:24.980 --> 01:33.130
your so-called education weight of some

01:30.470 --> 01:36.980
aristocratic family you are born off

01:33.130 --> 01:43.940
this is all nonsense which makes you a

01:36.980 --> 01:49.160
heavy person to go down very fast so she

01:43.940 --> 01:51.680
stands her fruits in a way on the Lotus

01:49.160 --> 01:57.440
and what a thing is beautiful is Lotus

01:51.680 --> 02:01.330
that she doesn't disturb any petals of

01:57.440 --> 02:05.090
the lotus nothing she just stands

02:01.330 --> 02:09.379
peacefully in a balance her center of

02:05.090 --> 02:13.310
gravity is so balanced that she cannot

02:09.379 --> 02:16.550
topple down you must be grounded in the

02:13.310 --> 02:21.290
mother earth into the practical side of

02:16.550 --> 02:24.499
it it's nothing something we are hanging

02:21.290 --> 02:28.110
in the air but we are grounded in the

02:24.499 --> 02:30.860
mother earth and a slightest thing happy

02:28.110 --> 02:34.260
to us again we come back to our balance

02:30.860 --> 02:38.550
so this is her position when she stands

02:34.260 --> 02:42.120
up in the Lotus now she has a hand one

02:38.550 --> 02:43.890
hand like this one hand like this their

02:42.120 --> 02:46.410
two hands which have got again the

02:43.890 --> 02:49.110
lotuses the Penguins yesterday you saw

02:46.410 --> 02:53.130
the pink pink is her fragrance I think

02:49.110 --> 03:00.840
is spread on the sky her nature is pink

02:53.130 --> 03:06.150
pink is inviting is loving she is a very

03:00.840 --> 03:10.950
fond hostess that she wants everybody to

03:06.150 --> 03:13.920
come in in her house but if you see a

03:10.950 --> 03:17.280
rich man he'll have ten dogs outside and

03:13.920 --> 03:18.780
nobody can come inside the house so the

03:17.280 --> 03:21.060
house is closed the doors are closed

03:18.780 --> 03:26.520
everything closed money is closed

03:21.060 --> 03:28.650
permanently so such a person cannot be

03:26.520 --> 03:33.170
called as Lakshmi buddy he's not

03:28.650 --> 03:37.610
eligible because he must have a cozy

03:33.170 --> 03:41.390
beautiful cozy again I say cozy house

03:37.610 --> 03:45.150
cause he doesn't mean like a hospital

03:41.390 --> 03:48.750
anything drops if he frightened oh my

03:45.150 --> 03:51.630
god let me pick it up cause he means

03:48.750 --> 03:55.019
where you are comfortable it's all right

03:51.630 --> 03:57.390
may I have to be not to this extreme or

03:55.019 --> 04:03.810
that extreme but something that will

03:57.390 --> 04:05.580
give joy to others to visitors to people

04:03.810 --> 04:09.959
who come to your house you soothe the

04:05.580 --> 04:13.950
sick people should feel happy to come to

04:09.959 --> 04:17.600
your house so there's no showing off not

04:13.950 --> 04:20.090
to show but to make them comfortable and

04:17.600 --> 04:25.050
very happy

04:20.090 --> 04:27.690
so the basic subtle point is that that

04:25.050 --> 04:32.370
with your love you are encouraging

04:27.690 --> 04:35.130
everyone you are helping everyone you

04:32.370 --> 04:40.410
are creating a confidence in him his

04:35.130 --> 04:41.540
personality and a kind of a report which

04:40.410 --> 04:44.190
is very

04:41.540 --> 04:47.250
you are not there to point out the bad

04:44.190 --> 04:49.800
points but you are there to cover all

04:47.250 --> 04:53.640
the bad points all the loopholes with

04:49.800 --> 04:54.810
your love that's your job and there you

04:53.640 --> 04:58.520
have to be honest

04:54.810 --> 05:01.530
the honesty is for yourself not for us

04:58.520 --> 05:04.470
keep that honesty to yourself because

05:01.530 --> 05:06.390
maybe is rational and maybe that it is

05:04.470 --> 05:10.020
just a matter of habit that you are

05:06.390 --> 05:12.390
trying to hurt others so first check on

05:10.020 --> 05:14.040
your mind and find out if you are trying

05:12.390 --> 05:16.050
to hurt others or you are trying to

05:14.040 --> 05:18.780
please others otherwise don't talk just

05:16.050 --> 05:20.220
keep quiet if you are going to say

05:18.780 --> 05:23.820
something to please others talk

05:20.220 --> 05:27.210
otherwise just don't talk and you'll be

05:23.820 --> 05:32.220
surprised when you say nice things to

05:27.210 --> 05:36.240
other how nice this comes to you now

05:32.220 --> 05:38.520
another thing is that the suggestion is

05:36.240 --> 05:42.750
of the left hand is like this mitch is

05:38.520 --> 05:45.030
giving a person was money must give but

05:42.750 --> 05:48.180
so secretly that this hand should not

05:45.030 --> 05:52.110
know is so far away this one this hand

05:48.180 --> 05:54.270
should give just security sometimes it's

05:52.110 --> 05:56.250
difficult to give money to anyone I find

05:54.270 --> 05:59.730
it difficult because I find it that

05:56.250 --> 06:02.940
people will not like it so that is a way

05:59.730 --> 06:06.450
of giving there are so sweet ways of

06:02.940 --> 06:09.780
giving just try to notice what that

06:06.450 --> 06:14.520
person likes so there should be a

06:09.780 --> 06:18.090
feeling of giving at the right time at

06:14.520 --> 06:20.100
the best abortion moment that is also

06:18.090 --> 06:22.620
one thing just like a camera man knows

06:20.100 --> 06:24.810
when to click in the same way you must

06:22.620 --> 06:28.520
know where to click when giving is

06:24.810 --> 06:32.100
concerned it should not be sensational

06:28.520 --> 06:35.580
but it should be elevating and that

06:32.100 --> 06:38.240
helps the person because whatever you

06:35.580 --> 06:42.960
give for spiritual growth is the one

06:38.240 --> 06:45.890
that is them best thing that you can

06:42.960 --> 06:48.390
give to anyone even in material things

06:45.890 --> 06:50.460
there are so many ways if you want to

06:48.390 --> 06:53.490
think about it of giving someone

06:50.460 --> 06:58.590
something that spiritually he feels

06:53.490 --> 07:00.840
for today he feels happy and joyous for

06:58.590 --> 07:04.710
sahaja Yogi's is very easy to handle

07:00.840 --> 07:07.910
their money with respect to I have

07:04.710 --> 07:12.509
something it should have a value behind

07:07.910 --> 07:17.310
that is the Dharma part anything that

07:12.509 --> 07:22.560
has an artistic value or some special

07:17.310 --> 07:28.229
work then you should buy them you want

07:22.560 --> 07:31.250
to give to something to others then the

07:28.229 --> 07:36.650
feelings you have in your heart is the

07:31.250 --> 07:39.030
value and that value is the real luxury

07:36.650 --> 07:44.460
so if your Lakshmi

07:39.030 --> 07:51.150
they say this much once you add to each

07:44.460 --> 07:56.610
value it becomes so the another hand is

07:51.150 --> 08:01.889
like this this hand is shown that you

07:56.610 --> 08:04.320
have to protect you have to protect we

08:01.889 --> 08:06.690
have to protect our children we have to

08:04.320 --> 08:10.080
protect our wives we have to protect our

08:06.690 --> 08:13.320
husbands whatever is good whatever is

08:10.080 --> 08:15.349
beautiful produced created by a one even

08:13.320 --> 08:19.590
by a child must be protected

08:15.349 --> 08:21.419
you must have feelings for them so what

08:19.590 --> 08:26.400
we have to protect here is the goodness

08:21.419 --> 08:29.669
is the peace you must protect a person

08:26.400 --> 08:32.729
who's virtuous very important but you

08:29.669 --> 08:34.380
must see things you must be informed

08:32.729 --> 08:36.839
when informed specially the ladies must

08:34.380 --> 08:38.880
be very very involved it is very

08:36.839 --> 08:41.190
important because what I find ladies in

08:38.880 --> 08:42.750
sahaja yoga they come they just jump in

08:41.190 --> 08:44.790
the scene finish that that's not the way

08:42.750 --> 08:47.190
you must learn how to swim you must know

08:44.790 --> 08:50.940
how to make others also to save to

08:47.190 --> 08:52.200
protect them you must know everything

08:50.940 --> 08:53.910
that's going on in this world where you

08:52.200 --> 08:55.920
are born you have to put your attention

08:53.910 --> 08:58.589
to all these things especially the women

08:55.920 --> 09:01.010
must know their chakras their Shakti is

08:58.589 --> 09:04.790
of love of attention

09:01.010 --> 09:04.790
so this protect you

09:05.190 --> 09:15.329
speciality has to be with us the sign of

09:10.170 --> 09:18.810
a person who is Laxmi potty is this you

09:15.329 --> 09:24.660
should have a house like the Lotus in

09:18.810 --> 09:28.069
the hands of the goddess he should

09:24.660 --> 09:34.160
protect people who are depending on him

09:28.069 --> 09:34.160
and from the left hand he should give

09:34.250 --> 09:41.870
this is the image of the Lakshmi

09:38.420 --> 09:46.970
this is what the Lakshmi is within you

09:41.870 --> 09:51.060
if you have these four things in balance

09:46.970 --> 09:55.110
without conditioning without evil then

09:51.060 --> 09:59.459
you are a sahaja yoga otherwise you are

09:55.110 --> 10:02.040
not so this is the beauty of sahaja Yoga

09:59.459 --> 10:04.100
is that you become really a great

10:02.040 --> 10:09.540
personality

10:04.100 --> 10:13.139
but it's not the end of it this is only

10:09.540 --> 10:22.470
the Lakshmi principle I told when in a

10:13.139 --> 10:26.009
human being the desire to rise higher

10:22.470 --> 10:28.740
comes in the Lakshmi principle becomes

10:26.009 --> 10:31.290
the Mahalakshmi principle in the

10:28.740 --> 10:35.550
awareness it acts on the matter like

10:31.290 --> 10:39.029
aesthetics people worry moreover about

10:35.550 --> 10:42.480
aesthetics then about possessions and

10:39.029 --> 10:45.290
when they start growing higher and

10:42.480 --> 10:53.339
higher in their awareness of seeking

10:45.290 --> 10:59.149
then they find that the attention should

10:53.339 --> 11:02.100
be such that they should pay more

10:59.149 --> 11:09.269
importance to the aesthetics of things

11:02.100 --> 11:13.380
than to the gross gross values now when

11:09.269 --> 11:17.550
this desire becomes evident in the human

11:13.380 --> 11:18.760
beings then only Lakshmi incarnate as

11:17.550 --> 11:22.900
Mahalakshmi

11:18.760 --> 11:26.140
thus the mahalakshmi's greatest weakness

11:22.900 --> 11:30.130
is that through her power only the

11:26.140 --> 11:33.010
sushumna is covered by Kundalini she's

11:30.130 --> 11:36.100
the power of our evolution and by her

11:33.010 --> 11:38.920
power only we have risen to be human

11:36.100 --> 11:42.130
beings she looks after all our

11:38.920 --> 11:46.090
well-being she's the one who looks after

11:42.130 --> 11:49.150
all of our problems of redemption she's

11:46.090 --> 11:51.340
the one who gives us all the possible

11:49.150 --> 11:54.850
help in our chakras and correction of

11:51.340 --> 11:59.290
them and she's the one who gives us all

11:54.850 --> 12:02.230
that is material or physical well-being

11:59.290 --> 12:04.210
she's the one who relates us to abrade

12:02.230 --> 12:08.260
the whole brain system is Mahalakshmi

12:04.210 --> 12:13.600
system so it is she who exposes the

12:08.260 --> 12:15.850
whole of the knowledge as truth to us on

12:13.600 --> 12:18.280
our central nervous system in the sense

12:15.850 --> 12:21.580
she's the bridge but the kundalini rises

12:18.280 --> 12:24.970
over the bridge so she's the Redeemer

12:21.580 --> 12:28.060
and she connects you to God once this

12:24.970 --> 12:30.850
Lakshmi principle covers you up then the

12:28.060 --> 12:35.320
Mahalakshmi principle starts is that you

12:30.850 --> 12:38.050
think of the world as a great challenge

12:35.320 --> 12:41.380
to you that you have to give them Hashmi

12:38.050 --> 12:43.930
principle that you have to give them

12:41.380 --> 12:46.720
realization you have to raise them up

12:43.930 --> 12:49.660
and this principle one starts working in

12:46.720 --> 12:55.360
the biological principle then all the

12:49.660 --> 13:00.040
problems are your own you have to start

12:55.360 --> 13:04.630
working it up so out of the Lakshmi

13:00.040 --> 13:07.320
principle I hope you get all the chakras

13:04.630 --> 13:11.140
all the principles satisfied in you

13:07.320 --> 13:14.230
fully and also the Mahalakshmi principle

13:11.140 --> 13:17.190
flows through your being you have to be

13:14.230 --> 13:19.600
very satisfied I am comfortable people

13:17.190 --> 13:20.950
it should be a personality which is

13:19.600 --> 13:23.380
above everything else

13:20.950 --> 13:25.600
such a beautiful personality you should

13:23.380 --> 13:29.380
have is the depth of the sea and the

13:25.600 --> 13:32.050
height of the colossal smile actually

13:29.380 --> 13:34.450
principle when it is awakened within you

13:32.050 --> 13:36.790
then you get out of a Lakshmi principle

13:34.450 --> 13:39.910
which makes you little selfish maybe

13:36.790 --> 13:45.100
self-centered and you get into a new

13:39.910 --> 13:48.540
dimension of searching of searching the

13:45.100 --> 13:51.899
higher very system something beyond

13:48.540 --> 13:54.910
without any limitations and that

13:51.899 --> 13:57.490
Mahalakshmi principle is really nothing

13:54.910 --> 14:00.850
in a sense if you see is nothing but you

13:57.490 --> 14:04.420
are seeking the universal now in the e

14:00.850 --> 14:07.720
sense it is that cause this process of

14:04.420 --> 14:12.850
loving it's the greatest joy giving

14:07.720 --> 14:17.310
thing the worry should be one why can't

14:12.850 --> 14:17.310
I love everyone as I love myself

14:20.960 --> 14:30.650
I tell you only this Universal love will

14:26.300 --> 14:35.750
give you that confidence and that higher

14:30.650 --> 14:38.240
status all the great poets William Blake

14:35.750 --> 14:40.790
or anywhere whatever they have done it's

14:38.240 --> 14:43.550
just because they have this universal

14:40.790 --> 14:48.080
love and they want to express it why not

14:43.550 --> 14:50.870
you do it so if you want your

14:48.080 --> 14:54.320
Mahalakshmi principle to be all the time

14:50.870 --> 14:57.590
burning then please see that you love

14:54.320 --> 14:59.720
each and every sahaja yogi that's the

14:57.590 --> 15:02.830
message today I hope you'll understand

14:59.720 --> 15:02.830
