1
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:11,529
Young Nirmala was also seized with the
Nationalistic zeal. She was always

2
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:18,275
extremely energetic and was a natural
leader among Her peers. In 1942 during the

3
00:00:18,275 --> 00:00:23,040
Quit India Movement She participated in
many daring episodes of picketing and was

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,405
also part of an underground group that
carried out many secret missions.

5
00:00:27,456 --> 00:00:36,006
Because we were all college students and
we all wanted to stop the colleges then,

6
00:00:36,006 --> 00:00:44,296
somehow or other we got into another kind
of mysterious acting. We used to distribute

7
00:00:44,296 --> 00:00:52,924
bulletins, used to call them, we used to
call them bullets and spread disorder

8
00:00:52,924 --> 00:01:01,038
among students. That time students were very
alert, that we should have our independence,

9
00:01:01,038 --> 00:01:07,631
we should be a free country and people
were not so dishonest that they are now.

10
00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:18,739
After that I joined Science College because
I wanted to do Medicine but Science College

11
00:01:20,504 --> 00:01:28,574
we had a strike and I became the leader of
the students, so they asked Me to get out

12
00:01:28,574 --> 00:01:36,169
of the college, so I had to leave the
college. Then I went to Lucknow to study

13
00:01:36,475 --> 00:01:43,315
in Isabella Thoburn College - that's also
another missionary - but from there I did

14
00:01:43,315 --> 00:01:49,539
My Inter Science and then I did My
Medicine from Lahore.
