00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.353
If you don't hear me this time please tell me.

00:00:07.698 --> 00:00:09.698
I am sorry for being late,

00:00:12.504 --> 00:00:14.051
for this lecture

00:00:15.935 --> 00:00:16.757
but, 

00:00:18.916 --> 00:00:22.309
Dr. Warren had time to explain to you,

00:00:23.434 --> 00:00:25.434
about this experience.

00:00:25.934 --> 00:00:29.671
Sometimes it is easier to understand

00:00:30.171 --> 00:00:32.171
this from a person,

00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:34.671
who has achieved it,

00:00:35.171 --> 00:00:37.303
than to understand from a person

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:39.894
who is talking from some tenth storey.

00:00:41.644 --> 00:00:43.644
That's what my father told me, 

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:47.552
that if somebody's born on the tenth storey,

00:00:48.268 --> 00:00:51.042
and the rest of them are on the first floor,

00:00:51.542 --> 00:00:55.091
if you start telling them from there they will first of all not listen,

00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:57.917
nor will they understand what you see.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.870
It's not proper,

00:01:01.435 --> 00:01:06.263
that we should try to tell them something from a level,

00:01:06.957 --> 00:01:09.556
to a level, which is still there static,

00:01:09.797 --> 00:01:11.797
in their mind.

00:01:12.125 --> 00:01:16.523
So one has to, raise their, consciousness,

00:01:17.023 --> 00:01:20.740
two three storeys so they start seeing that there's something beyond.

00:01:22.425 --> 00:01:26.105
But, in doing so,

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:29.336
so many mistakes,

00:01:31.086 --> 00:01:34.668
have been, there, before,

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.545
and some people have done it deliberately,

00:01:38.217 --> 00:01:40.217
some are misguided

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:42.670
and some are doing it deliberately.

00:01:43.623 --> 00:01:45.623
Net result is just the same.

00:01:45.951 --> 00:01:49.443
Even if you give poison to someone by mistake,

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:54.599
or in a misguided way, the result is the same.

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:56.682
In the same way,

00:01:57.462 --> 00:01:59.462
whether you are misguided,

00:01:59.962 --> 00:02:03.437
or whether you do it deliberately, whatever is wrong

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:05.829
has an effect on the kundalini.

00:02:08.463 --> 00:02:09.946
Now the Aquarian Age,

00:02:10.058 --> 00:02:13.023
is the word I picked up from Dr. Warren,

00:02:13.437 --> 00:02:15.437
which is so true today.

00:02:15.937 --> 00:02:18.476
Aquarian means the water carrier,

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.565
and in Sanskrit language it is called as kumbha.

00:02:23.065 --> 00:02:26.666
Kumbha is the one what we call the kundalini,

00:02:27.166 --> 00:02:29.320
the mooladhara is the kumbha,

00:02:30.057 --> 00:02:33.823
where the kundalini is there, the power of kundalini is there.

00:02:34.323 --> 00:02:37.030
So to call it an Aquarian age must be some,

00:02:38.026 --> 00:02:41.736
work of some, realized soul who could see that,

00:02:41.805 --> 00:02:44.838
in this age the kundalini is going to be awakened,

00:02:45.166 --> 00:02:51.709
and that, an age will start of people getting their kundalini awakened.

00:02:53.545 --> 00:02:56.545
Now I have already talked to you the other day about

00:02:56.722 --> 00:03:00.234
this second center, which is called as swadhisthana,

00:03:00.993 --> 00:03:03.255
which gives us our sustenance

00:03:03.755 --> 00:03:05.755
and also our power to create.

00:03:06.255 --> 00:03:08.849
The sustenance is created inside,

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.697
that green part, which is,

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:18.734
represented by main ten Primordial Masters,

00:03:19.234 --> 00:03:22.622
and these ten Primordial Masters had another

00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:25.968
series of masters who were called as,

00:03:26.145 --> 00:03:28.145
Disciple Principles.

00:03:28.602 --> 00:03:31.660
Now about these people I have talked to you last time,

00:03:32.246 --> 00:03:34.759
but today I would like to speak to you

00:03:34.936 --> 00:03:38.492
about other centers, specially this nabhi,

00:03:38.992 --> 00:03:45.011
which is the navel centre which is very important in human beings.

00:03:46.114 --> 00:03:49.321
This is the centre by which we seek.

00:03:49.735 --> 00:03:53.388
When in amoeba stage we seek,

00:03:54.678 --> 00:03:58.037
food, at a higher level

00:03:58.128 --> 00:04:00.428
we start seeking heights,

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.910
like when they became mammoth and all these

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.410
animals they wanted to have a height,

00:04:06.673 --> 00:04:11.459
to go over the trees to be able to master them and to eat the leaves,

00:04:11.636 --> 00:04:14.875
but they became so much outsized with their height,

00:04:15.116 --> 00:04:17.701
that they had to become smaller animals,

00:04:17.792 --> 00:04:20.371
like say intelligent animals,

00:04:20.634 --> 00:04:25.376
and, like say cats and things like that, cat family.

00:04:26.781 --> 00:04:30.736
And this is how the evolution has been,

00:04:32.658 --> 00:04:36.551
brought forth through our seeking as amoeba,

00:04:36.771 --> 00:04:39.814
then as animals and now as human beings.

00:04:40.314 --> 00:04:43.038
As we have evolved higher and higher,

00:04:43.538 --> 00:04:46.718
we have become subtler and subtler in our seeking.

00:04:47.218 --> 00:04:51.337
For example the people who are seeking say power,

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:57.442
are not so evolved as people who are seeking their spirit, no doubt about it.

00:04:57.942 --> 00:05:00.338
Because you have gone through that, you have had enough of it.

00:05:00.429 --> 00:05:03.265
Maybe last lives you might have been kings and queens

00:05:03.442 --> 00:05:05.704
and you must have seen all the jokes of it,

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.013
so you said now, it's had enough of it,

00:05:08.104 --> 00:05:10.328
this power business, we don't want to have anymore,

00:05:10.526 --> 00:05:12.526
such a headache we don't want to have.

00:05:13.026 --> 00:05:15.747
The people who are seeking money also,

00:05:15.902 --> 00:05:18.560
are the people who have had enough of it

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:21.038
and they were fed up of it so they said now we have had it.

00:05:21.594 --> 00:05:25.827
So now you are seekers of, something beyond.

00:05:26.456 --> 00:05:28.960
It has been always so, something beyond we seek,

00:05:29.374 --> 00:05:32.868
but this seeking beyond is not described

00:05:33.088 --> 00:05:36.677
to so many people and they are not able to understand

00:05:36.724 --> 00:05:40.479
what is the beyond, that's why this center is very important,

00:05:40.656 --> 00:05:42.656
of your evolutionary process.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:50.378
Now, first of all as I have told you that we have to be in balance,

00:05:50.878 --> 00:05:53.833
that's one thing we must have is the balance in life.

00:05:54.333 --> 00:05:57.407
I mean in commonsense also we can see supposing there's

00:05:57.433 --> 00:05:59.433
a car going only on one wheel,

00:05:59.545 --> 00:06:01.545
how many would like to travel by that.

00:06:02.498 --> 00:06:06.371
Anything that you do in life has to have a balance,

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.011
otherwise, anything, even catching something, holding something

00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:16.590
or, small small things, even riding a bicycle

00:06:16.637 --> 00:06:18.959
you know that you have to have a balance.

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:21.788
So if the kundalini has to move,

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:24.486
you have to be a balanced personality,

00:06:24.684 --> 00:06:26.684
a personality with a temperate,

00:06:27.184 --> 00:06:32.383
nature and must have a balanced attitude towards life.

00:06:32.883 --> 00:06:35.797
That is very important, but in case it is not,

00:06:35.888 --> 00:06:39.827
you can be sucked into the central path of the sushumna,

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:42.025
in the central path of your evolution.

00:06:42.137 --> 00:06:45.739
Now the evolution takes place by remaining in the central path.

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:49.236
Those who go to the extremes fall out of this.

00:06:50.878 --> 00:06:54.722
Now the virus that we suffer from very commonly,

00:06:55.308 --> 00:06:58.777
is nothing but a kind of a vegetable

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:00.889
which is fallen out of evolution.

00:07:01.885 --> 00:07:04.762
Now the vegetable that we call as tobacco,

00:07:05.348 --> 00:07:09.698
is going to fall out of complete evolution and you'll be surprised after

00:07:10.241 --> 00:07:12.371
some years you will not find

00:07:12.462 --> 00:07:16.152
any tobacco growing anywhere because it will go out of evolution,

00:07:17.234 --> 00:07:21.777
thanks to human beings that they misunderstood the role of tobacco.

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:25.204
Tobacco is an insecticide, is to be used

00:07:25.402 --> 00:07:28.885
for killing the insects and not to kill yourself.

00:07:29.385 --> 00:07:33.873
But, we sometimes forget, that whatever,

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.020
God has created for the good,

00:07:37.197 --> 00:07:40.178
sometimes we can use it for our destruction.

00:07:40.678 --> 00:07:44.640
Same is alcohol. Alcohol was created for polishing,

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:48.795
it's very good for example if you have to polish your crystal,

00:07:48.929 --> 00:07:50.690
you should use gin is very good,

00:07:50.781 --> 00:07:53.221
for diamonds or anything.

00:07:54.799 --> 00:07:59.543
Is just a polish, it's a polish for the,

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.470
for anything, it gives a polish. You see alcohol is a polish and

00:08:03.546 --> 00:08:07.715
its composition is such that it gives a polish to a thing.

00:08:07.854 --> 00:08:11.665
Now God wanted you to have polished surfaces and polished things

00:08:11.826 --> 00:08:14.987
and all the clean look of it so He gave you this polish.

00:08:15.126 --> 00:08:17.856
Now you started drinking it, now what to do.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.639
He never asked you to drink, but if you drink that,

00:08:24.736 --> 00:08:27.250
then it polishes your intestines also.

00:08:27.432 --> 00:08:31.122
But it has its own nature. It doesn't have any

00:08:31.367 --> 00:08:35.609
idea of morality, poor thing what, we can't blame the alcohol,

00:08:35.876 --> 00:08:40.099
because it is suppose to polish, wherever you put it it polishes all right,

00:08:40.323 --> 00:08:43.024
so it polishes your liver also nicely.

00:08:47.533 --> 00:08:51.074
And when the liver is nicely polished then what happens

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.487
that the heat from the liver,

00:08:53.584 --> 00:08:57.273
which is for the expulsion from the body,

00:08:57.773 --> 00:09:00.996
it has to pass into the bloodstream, cannot because there's a,

00:09:01.135 --> 00:09:03.559
barrier and because of that barrier

00:09:03.783 --> 00:09:06.123
poor liver does not know what to do.

00:09:06.284 --> 00:09:09.781
It just goes on accumulating all the heat within it

00:09:09.899 --> 00:09:14.896
and that's how your liver goes out of circulation of anything,

00:09:15.396 --> 00:09:19.389
and you have liver problems and you feel very giddy, nauseated,

00:09:19.719 --> 00:09:24.007
and liver is the one which really cleanses your attention.

00:09:24.507 --> 00:09:27.330
Whatever you gather from your attention it cleanses.

00:09:27.703 --> 00:09:32.419
So you become horrid I mean you are all the time angry,

00:09:32.495 --> 00:09:35.965
hot-tempered, you bark at people all the time,

00:09:36.168 --> 00:09:40.794
all that thing is typically liverish you see. We grow tall,

00:09:40.933 --> 00:09:44.621
like that absolutely straight line, and

00:09:44.676 --> 00:09:48.178
you become very hot-tempered. Sometimes you could be hawk-like you know,

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.313
people will be afraid of going nearer such a person,

00:09:51.601 --> 00:09:54.656
because such a person can be very dry personality

00:09:55.008 --> 00:09:56.433
and that's why you'll find,

00:09:56.551 --> 00:09:59.921
drunkard people if you they're over-drunk you go near them they'll just

00:10:00.018 --> 00:10:02.276
beat you for nothing at all. I mean

00:10:02.585 --> 00:10:04.585
it sometimes happens that by chance

00:10:04.852 --> 00:10:08.059
if you go and ask some drunkard that: 'What's the time?' in the night

00:10:08.093 --> 00:10:09.244
you will have it.

00:10:09.341 --> 00:10:15.265
So, because it spoils your awareness

00:10:15.362 --> 00:10:19.412
and in that awareness a nice man also could be like that,

00:10:19.467 --> 00:10:24.186
but of course there could be a case where a person might become better.

00:10:24.347 --> 00:10:27.072
That is also another thing that can happen

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:29.571
when you get possessed by this

00:10:29.753 --> 00:10:32.576
left-side movement because alcohol reduces

00:10:32.715 --> 00:10:36.068
your awareness and you go to the left-side movement to the left side,

00:10:36.291 --> 00:10:40.148
may give you, a feeling 'Oh I'm very much better now'

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:45.032
and sort of you get happy because your ego is subsided and everything is

00:10:45.277 --> 00:10:49.104
alright and 'I'm really moderate now, I cannot hit anyone

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.525
and let me have little bit and sleep off'.

00:10:51.707 --> 00:10:54.006
But next day there's a hangover

00:10:54.145 --> 00:10:56.145
and you feel so horrible with it,

00:10:56.221 --> 00:10:57.496
that you don't know what to do, I mean

00:10:57.589 --> 00:10:59.996
it's something, then again you want to have it in the night

00:11:00.072 --> 00:11:04.607
because you want to again go to the same realm into the left side.

00:11:05.107 --> 00:11:09.308
Now this left side realm, apparently shows that there is

00:11:09.808 --> 00:11:14.695
reduction in the weight of the ego, but it does not, it wobbles.

00:11:14.893 --> 00:11:19.385
What happens that you go to the superego on the left hand side you see there,

00:11:19.583 --> 00:11:24.087
and the ego then thinks that it has gone down because the superego

00:11:24.156 --> 00:11:28.853
increases in size. But when superego increases, the ego is pushed down

00:11:29.094 --> 00:11:33.070
and then when you come to your ego condition,

00:11:33.139 --> 00:11:35.705
then it pushes down so there's a big wobbling going on,

00:11:35.796 --> 00:11:38.809
and such people get ultimately very much confused.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:42.264
They might end up in a lunatic asylum I don't know what they do,

00:11:42.419 --> 00:11:48.698
but, when they are even sane you can find they lose the grip over life,

00:11:49.004 --> 00:11:52.891
for example such people can become very frivolous, and

00:11:52.938 --> 00:11:56.139
cannot feel the joy of life without drinking.

00:11:56.487 --> 00:12:01.691
It's most amazing that people can't enjoy each other unless and until

00:12:01.868 --> 00:12:06.934
there's a glass in between. I mean human beings are so beautiful,

00:12:07.994 --> 00:12:12.690
and they have the capacity to enjoy each other, so much,

00:12:13.427 --> 00:12:17.602
they are the only ones who are blessed more than anybody else.

00:12:17.973 --> 00:12:20.715
But if there's a glass all the time in between

00:12:20.934 --> 00:12:23.215
then they can just bark at each other,

00:12:23.564 --> 00:12:25.564
they cannot enjoy each other.

00:12:26.215 --> 00:12:29.837
The enjoyment should be complete when there's nothing in between.

00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:33.447
Now this is what I was telling you, this nahbi chakra.

00:12:33.947 --> 00:12:39.317
This nahbi chakra gets, ruined also when we take to,

00:12:39.623 --> 00:12:42.867
alcohols or serious things like that, drugs and,

00:12:43.087 --> 00:12:45.518
even I've seen certain medicines can spoil this.

00:12:45.953 --> 00:12:49.278
Then you get a problem with the other things like digestion,

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:52.856
you get constipation, all sorts of things take place,

00:12:53.011 --> 00:12:54.165
by which you develop

00:12:54.368 --> 00:12:57.864
gas troubles and other troubles and then your heart troubles and it

00:12:57.933 --> 00:13:00.042
goes on one after another.

00:13:00.112 --> 00:13:03.135
I do not say that it's only alcohol that will cause.

00:13:03.355 --> 00:13:07.552
There are other causes also, but alcohol can never be helpful,

00:13:07.858 --> 00:13:11.032
in giving you good health. Some people

00:13:11.123 --> 00:13:14.482
have a feeling that if you take alcohol then only you will keep good health.

00:13:14.982 --> 00:13:18.473
Is a wrong thing. Because health is not only physical health.

00:13:18.671 --> 00:13:21.966
It's also mental health. People think that

00:13:22.253 --> 00:13:24.451
physical health is the end of everything,

00:13:24.519 --> 00:13:29.627
is absolutely wrong because we are not only the physical being.

00:13:30.321 --> 00:13:33.549
We are also the mental being and the emotional being.

00:13:33.812 --> 00:13:36.480
And when you play too much with your nahbi chakra

00:13:36.678 --> 00:13:39.476
you have the biggest problem and that is that

00:13:39.653 --> 00:13:43.125
you can never be successful in life

00:13:43.259 --> 00:13:46.704
as far as enjoyment is concerned, of your achievements.

00:13:47.782 --> 00:13:50.147
For example a person becomes rich,

00:13:50.453 --> 00:13:53.059
unduly rich he becomes, is a blessing

00:13:53.174 --> 00:13:55.777
I should say of nahbi chakra on the right-hand side.

00:13:56.557 --> 00:14:01.621
Right-hand side nahbi chakra can give you a lot of wealth,

00:14:01.819 --> 00:14:07.123
a lot of money and you'll have ten cars and fifteen people attending to you,

00:14:07.214 --> 00:14:10.531
everything you may have but, it cannot,

00:14:11.031 --> 00:14:13.800
it cannot give you the satisfaction of life.

00:14:14.947 --> 00:14:19.606
You will go on accumulating and end up with a suicide or something like that

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.740
and you would not know why you are

00:14:21.917 --> 00:14:23.570
bent upon committing suicide.

00:14:23.728 --> 00:14:26.070
That's why in all affluent countries you find

00:14:26.376 --> 00:14:28.376
people are planning to commit suicide

00:14:28.467 --> 00:14:31.145
and the more affluent they are the worse it is.

00:14:32.313 --> 00:14:35.298
But the left side gets completely dried.

00:14:35.561 --> 00:14:39.481
Now the left side is the centre of

00:14:39.658 --> 00:14:41.658
the family life, the Gruhalaxshmi,

00:14:41.727 --> 00:14:43.727
the Goddess of the family,

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.830
the household you see.

00:14:47.158 --> 00:14:49.607
A person who runs after money too much,

00:14:50.107 --> 00:14:53.747
forgets his family. He has no time for his family.

00:14:53.924 --> 00:14:56.297
The husband and wife may meet somewhere

00:14:56.388 --> 00:14:57.871
on the airport

00:14:58.026 --> 00:15:01.654
or may just wave at each other sometimes you see, crossing each other,

00:15:01.917 --> 00:15:03.917
or the children suffer the most.

00:15:04.417 --> 00:15:07.765
And in that case the women also then take up with the men,

00:15:07.856 --> 00:15:12.684
they compete what's wrong, they start copying men,

00:15:12.861 --> 00:15:14.861
and in so doing so,

00:15:14.952 --> 00:15:16.952
when they compete with each other,

00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:20.801
then what happens, that this family life gets disturbed.

00:15:21.301 --> 00:15:24.271
The woman of the household is dissatisfied,

00:15:24.383 --> 00:15:27.267
her ego is not satisfied. In olden times

00:15:27.444 --> 00:15:29.444
the man used to go in the jungle,

00:15:29.621 --> 00:15:32.249
and get all the wood cut, bring it home,

00:15:32.404 --> 00:15:34.534
and give it to the wife and wife used to cook.

00:15:34.603 --> 00:15:37.469
There was no problem because there was barter system.

00:15:37.516 --> 00:15:39.516
He could see her working in the household.

00:15:39.628 --> 00:15:41.411
Now the husband earns the money

00:15:41.458 --> 00:15:45.426
and the woman spends. I mean that also requires some work,

00:15:45.452 --> 00:15:46.834
isn't it to spend the money.

00:15:47.011 --> 00:15:51.180
But to man it looks like, that I'm the earning member and she's the spender.

00:15:51.421 --> 00:15:56.556
So she said all right, I will also earn. But in this too much of competition,

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:59.315
too much of competition like this, between the two,

00:15:59.707 --> 00:16:02.746
what happens, the family suffers, the children suffer 

00:16:02.987 --> 00:16:06.245
and such a person will have problem with the wife, the wife will have

00:16:06.336 --> 00:16:10.937
problem with the husband and you can always feel that center on this finger,

00:16:11.114 --> 00:16:14.298
if that finger is catching, that means there's something wrong

00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:17.109
with your family relationship,

00:16:17.609 --> 00:16:21.065
that you have to adjust yourself, or he has to adjust.

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:26.194
It's an important thing. Because you are like the flowers

00:16:26.241 --> 00:16:28.241
which have to produce a fruit.

00:16:28.439 --> 00:16:29.963
That's what nature wants.

00:16:30.204 --> 00:16:32.881
Nature wants that you are there to produce the, 

00:16:33.877 --> 00:16:36.901
fruit, that is your children.

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:41.343
That's why you are men and women. That's the basics.

00:16:41.843 --> 00:16:44.478
Now, if you think that 

00:16:44.547 --> 00:16:48.579
with that responsibility if you can do something else you should do.

00:16:48.691 --> 00:16:50.217
But the main thing is that,

00:16:50.243 --> 00:16:54.092
and if you don't do that, is to look after your children, to give them joy,

00:16:54.204 --> 00:16:56.204
have a beautiful nest for them,

00:16:56.316 --> 00:16:59.982
then I must say that you are neglecting your basic duty

00:17:00.073 --> 00:17:02.482
and your attention is on something else.

00:17:02.637 --> 00:17:06.530
That's why so many divorces are taking place and problems are there,

00:17:06.685 --> 00:17:09.327
the women ask for their rights, they go beyond their limits,

00:17:09.353 --> 00:17:12.022
they became dominating here, the men become dominating.

00:17:12.285 --> 00:17:14.114
That's not the way we are going to solve it.

00:17:14.291 --> 00:17:16.464
We have to know that we are two wheels,

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:18.511
two wheels of one chariot,

00:17:18.602 --> 00:17:20.602
one on the left, another in the right.

00:17:20.822 --> 00:17:22.822
Now they are not similar,

00:17:23.063 --> 00:17:26.525
they're not similar they are two types one left side one right side.

00:17:26.874 --> 00:17:28.874
But, they are equal.

00:17:29.633 --> 00:17:32.272
In their, whatever they do it's equal,

00:17:32.362 --> 00:17:35.513
they are to be respected equally in the same manner.

00:17:35.797 --> 00:17:37.797
And it is always so for example,

00:17:37.844 --> 00:17:40.709
I had a girl who came to me

00:17:40.993 --> 00:17:42.993
and she was a private secretary,

00:17:43.299 --> 00:17:45.299
and she told me: 'Mother you say this,

00:17:45.562 --> 00:17:49.618
but I've seen that all these men come and flirt with their private secretaries.'

00:17:49.838 --> 00:17:53.201
So I said: 'All right, maybe so, but what does that matter.'

00:17:53.335 --> 00:17:55.132
You see that shows that's something wrong with the man, he

00:17:55.158 --> 00:17:56.962
doesn't understand, he's off his head, he

00:17:57.009 --> 00:17:59.422
cannot enjoy his wife and he's running after other things.

00:17:59.599 --> 00:18:02.208
It's like having something in your house and you are

00:18:02.406 --> 00:18:03.975
looking at other things you see.

00:18:04.281 --> 00:18:06.542
Like in India if you go to some,

00:18:06.632 --> 00:18:09.451
somebody comes to your house be careful about your things,

00:18:09.585 --> 00:18:12.103
but in England I tell them, if somebody comes to your house

00:18:12.194 --> 00:18:14.179
be careful about your wife, see.

00:18:16.511 --> 00:18:19.061
Is just a little difference between,

00:18:19.173 --> 00:18:22.202
but the second one is a dangerous thing because fundamental,

00:18:22.379 --> 00:18:24.143
the wife is the fundamental thing,

00:18:24.234 --> 00:18:27.362
because you do not know what she will do, how she will react

00:18:27.495 --> 00:18:31.656
and you do not know how the guests because that is regarded as their freedom.

00:18:32.156 --> 00:18:35.479
But if you take away something from somebody's house that's not freedom,

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:37.570
because we can take away anything from somebody's house

00:18:37.596 --> 00:18:39.143
why should anybody arrest us?

00:18:39.449 --> 00:18:42.558
Because there is a free will for you to do what you like,

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:45.824
is allowed to do what you like, but in that free will

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:49.566
you are harming so many people and ultimately your society.

00:18:50.066 --> 00:18:52.817
Now these two wheels, as I said,

00:18:53.123 --> 00:18:55.558
are very important to God,

00:18:56.424 --> 00:19:00.693
because so many great people want to take birth on this earth.

00:19:01.538 --> 00:19:04.840
So many great souls want to take birth on this earth,

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.340
and if we behave in such a manner,

00:19:07.711 --> 00:19:11.641
that all the time this chariot is this way going up and that way going up,

00:19:11.753 --> 00:19:14.343
I can tell you no child would be willing

00:19:14.456 --> 00:19:16.768
to be born in this place who are great people.

00:19:16.808 --> 00:19:21.166
Only the people who are of the worst type will be born,

00:19:21.235 --> 00:19:25.731
they'll be hooligans, they'll be horrible people with a horrid nature

00:19:25.822 --> 00:19:29.190
and they'll spoil the whole atmosphere of the countries

00:19:29.324 --> 00:19:32.954
where husband wife have, do not have good relationship.

00:19:33.454 --> 00:19:35.454
The children will be such hooligans

00:19:35.566 --> 00:19:37.566
and such horrible things

00:19:37.613 --> 00:19:42.299
that you'll be surprised that at the age of eight years and five years

00:19:42.411 --> 00:19:44.171
they'll be committing murders and doing

00:19:44.262 --> 00:19:46.881
all kinds of such thing that you'll be shocked.

00:19:48.588 --> 00:19:50.588
Now between you and me,

00:19:50.851 --> 00:19:53.387
because you are also husbands and wife and,

00:19:53.694 --> 00:19:55.887
one thing it should be there that

00:19:56.387 --> 00:20:00.141
we should not quarrel before our children.

00:20:00.749 --> 00:20:04.694
We should have all decency of husband and wife, there are so many things

00:20:04.763 --> 00:20:06.935
we do not do in the presence of our children.

00:20:07.133 --> 00:20:09.625
In the same way we need not sit down and

00:20:09.699 --> 00:20:12.125
quarrel and say: 'I hate you and I hate you'.

00:20:12.496 --> 00:20:16.543
I tell you this is something you have to change little bit in our language.

00:20:16.677 --> 00:20:19.005
In India if somebody says: 'I hate you'

00:20:19.117 --> 00:20:21.969
it's regarded, that man regarded as a most unmannerly person.

00:20:22.016 --> 00:20:25.636
I mean its very bad manners to say 'I hate you' how,

00:20:25.748 --> 00:20:29.024
I mean it shows that you are very low type of person to say like that.

00:20:29.524 --> 00:20:30.726
But 'I hate you' so what.

00:20:31.704 --> 00:20:33.226
If you hate so what, you are not God.

00:20:33.898 --> 00:20:35.898
If you hate me what does it matter, actually,

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:38.570
if somebody hates someone, so what.

00:20:38.984 --> 00:20:43.465
That shows that person is not a good person, just to hate someone.

00:20:43.706 --> 00:20:47.600
'I hate you' is a way of expressing something

00:20:47.798 --> 00:20:53.359
that is I feel, is very wrong for the family system. It shocks children.

00:20:53.859 --> 00:20:56.821
Children look upon you as ideals.

00:20:56.929 --> 00:20:58.724
When they are born you should see them,

00:20:58.963 --> 00:21:01.935
most of the children nowadays in Australia are born realized,

00:21:01.969 --> 00:21:05.293
I see them around when I went to the airport and I see they're born realized.

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:07.550
And they watch you, and they're surprised

00:21:07.658 --> 00:21:09.658
and they sulk and they feel very sad.

00:21:09.822 --> 00:21:11.485
They don't like, they don't take sides,

00:21:11.537 --> 00:21:14.117
they don't like the father to fight the mother, the mother to fight.

00:21:14.505 --> 00:21:18.280
And one other thing which you must understand,

00:21:18.498 --> 00:21:20.780
that a certain gradation has to be there.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.941
A woman is the strongest point of the household.

00:21:24.404 --> 00:21:25.987
Like this Mother Earth is.

00:21:26.151 --> 00:21:28.840
She takes all the problems upon Herself.

00:21:29.452 --> 00:21:31.098
She, because She's the strongest.

00:21:31.355 --> 00:21:35.176
Who else can withstand this kind of, weight on Her.

00:21:35.433 --> 00:21:36.847
It's the Mother only can do that.

00:21:37.123 --> 00:21:39.951
In the same way a woman in the house is the mother,

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:41.672
and she has to bear.

00:21:41.985 --> 00:21:43.667
You see it's nice to have a husband

00:21:43.738 --> 00:21:45.944
who comes home and says whatever he likes

00:21:46.034 --> 00:21:48.034
and takes out all the filth on you,

00:21:48.254 --> 00:21:50.982
than to have a husband who is very sweet, hello, hello

00:21:51.128 --> 00:21:54.594
and outside he goes like a bumptious tiger on everyone.

00:21:55.896 --> 00:22:01.204
Such a man is, has to be, he has to, you see they're like children I would say,

00:22:01.704 --> 00:22:05.559
they are like children. They have to take out their tensions on their wives only,

00:22:05.742 --> 00:22:07.930
and you should be an absorber of that

00:22:07.982 --> 00:22:09.531
and that's the sign of a woman.

00:22:09.639 --> 00:22:13.136
A strong woman doesn't get easily disturbed by these things.

00:22:13.319 --> 00:22:15.319
She's not bothered. She says all right,

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:16.708
you little baby come along,

00:22:16.854 --> 00:22:19.266
now I have had four babies, now this is the fifth one

00:22:19.318 --> 00:22:20.903
which is the smallest has come.

00:22:21.067 --> 00:22:23.867
Let him shout and scream, even with the children,

00:22:23.957 --> 00:22:26.831
you have to be patient, they'll hit you, they'll do anything.

00:22:27.088 --> 00:22:29.425
I would say that way in India, children are treated

00:22:29.533 --> 00:22:31.533
very kindly and they are special things.

00:22:31.679 --> 00:22:33.830
They will do what they like when they are children,

00:22:34.031 --> 00:22:36.517
but when they grow up we do not have teenage problem,

00:22:36.607 --> 00:22:39.149
we do not have problem where the children don't respect.

00:22:40.078 --> 00:22:42.078
In that, this is very important

00:22:42.858 --> 00:22:45.252
aspect of our modern life

00:22:45.304 --> 00:22:49.568
that we have to understand, what is the relationship of husband and wife is.

00:22:49.881 --> 00:22:54.664
Husband is like say, a gentleman who

00:22:54.714 --> 00:22:57.565
is definitely is to be respected by the wife.

00:22:57.617 --> 00:23:00.384
But if she does not respect the husband she cannot

00:23:00.474 --> 00:23:01.954
get respect from her children.

00:23:02.211 --> 00:23:04.211
But the husband has to be respectable man,

00:23:04.394 --> 00:23:07.708
that's very important. If the man is not respectable, he

00:23:07.742 --> 00:23:09.310
cannot be respected easily.

00:23:09.362 --> 00:23:12.441
But the more is the woman has to be very respectable,

00:23:13.165 --> 00:23:15.165
if she doesn't give her respect,

00:23:15.366 --> 00:23:17.366
you can handle any kind of man

00:23:17.418 --> 00:23:21.807
if you are clever enough, drunkards, all sorts, they come round.

00:23:22.307 --> 00:23:25.025
Because after all they're human beings, they're not bad people.

00:23:25.525 --> 00:23:28.747
But because of mishandling they just get out

00:23:28.893 --> 00:23:32.286
and the domination of men is just a myth.

00:23:32.599 --> 00:23:34.750
See, they cannot dominate,

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:38.510
they're incapable of domination. They just do it because they want to

00:23:38.562 --> 00:23:40.562
feel that they are superior, that's all.

00:23:40.763 --> 00:23:43.840
But they cannot dominate. Whatever domination, what is their domination,

00:23:43.892 --> 00:23:45.482
is little little things here and there.

00:23:45.609 --> 00:23:47.609
Just like children, that's what it is.

00:23:47.773 --> 00:23:51.295
If women understand their maturity and their,

00:23:52.075 --> 00:23:55.431
their responsibility as women, because they are the shakti,

00:23:55.744 --> 00:23:57.744
they are the power of the family,

00:23:57.908 --> 00:24:03.088
and they are the potent shakti for the husband as well as for the children,

00:24:03.383 --> 00:24:05.646
but if they get disturbed

00:24:05.792 --> 00:24:08.494
then the husband is disturbed and children are also disturbed.

00:24:08.695 --> 00:24:11.858
But they are potent, while the kinetics are these people.

00:24:11.948 --> 00:24:13.948
Like here is the electricity, all right,

00:24:14.094 --> 00:24:16.617
so we say very good, lamp and electricity and all that,

00:24:16.763 --> 00:24:19.605
but from where does it come. The source is somewhere

00:24:19.751 --> 00:24:21.751
quietly sending the source,

00:24:21.896 --> 00:24:24.251
and enjoying itself by giving that source.

00:24:24.527 --> 00:24:26.913
In the same way this is a very important centre.

00:24:27.172 --> 00:24:30.365
Why I said it because today I went,

00:24:31.052 --> 00:24:36.071
went to Melbourne and all the time this finger was burning up to this point.

00:24:36.571 --> 00:24:38.328
So that means there's something wrong with

00:24:38.384 --> 00:24:41.458
men and women as far as their family life is concerned.

00:24:41.678 --> 00:24:43.396
They're all very upset I felt.

00:24:43.542 --> 00:24:45.320
The husband is upset and the women.

00:24:45.447 --> 00:24:48.088
Maybe the laws maybe against men, maybe here 

00:24:48.122 --> 00:24:50.122
I don't know. But in America I found

00:24:50.323 --> 00:24:52.899
a husband and wife relationship is very queer.

00:24:53.119 --> 00:24:56.496
For example I met a lady, very queer people they are.

00:24:58.368 --> 00:25:01.779
I went and stayed with a lady she had a luxurious house

00:25:01.831 --> 00:25:04.318
with a swimming pool and this and that,

00:25:04.371 --> 00:25:08.965
a maid in coming to do everything up and five storeys and this,

00:25:09.931 --> 00:25:13.673
and she said: 'You see my, one of my former husbands 

00:25:13.725 --> 00:25:17.844
will come and see you in Los Angeles.' I said: 'All right very good idea'.

00:25:18.344 --> 00:25:21.742
So he came, he was like a pauper you know walking like this,

00:25:22.016 --> 00:25:25.698
and he says: 'I have got a room on rents where I'm staying Mother,

00:25:25.937 --> 00:25:28.768
 it's very difficult, I have to share it with someone'. I said: 'What?

00:25:29.473 --> 00:25:31.473
That lady who was there,

00:25:31.674 --> 00:25:34.897
she has a very big house, she's supposed to be your wife'.

00:25:34.987 --> 00:25:38.883
He said: 'That's mine, I tell you, I lost it to her in a case'.

00:25:38.991 --> 00:25:41.271
I said: 'How could you lose that in a case?'

00:25:41.379 --> 00:25:44.339
'Because she asked for a divorce and because

00:25:44.429 --> 00:25:47.708
she found guilty out of me something some,

00:25:47.872 --> 00:25:51.242
so she got it'. And she married three husbands, all the three husbands

00:25:51.443 --> 00:25:54.114
are moving like paupers, and this lady's very rich.

00:25:57.356 --> 00:26:00.779
If you marry seven husbands, seven husbands are finished forever

00:26:00.869 --> 00:26:04.269
but the lady is so rich, seven times more than any one of them.

00:26:04.956 --> 00:26:07.276
So this is kind of a law I don't understand.

00:26:07.478 --> 00:26:09.687
First of all why there should be a law, I don't understand,

00:26:09.721 --> 00:26:11.213
between husband and wife.

00:26:11.265 --> 00:26:14.991
I just don't understand. I mean we don't have such laws in India but

00:26:15.118 --> 00:26:16.895
everybody cares for the wife,

00:26:17.003 --> 00:26:20.280
because she is the nearest and the dearest person they have.

00:26:20.612 --> 00:26:24.425
Who else to depend? If the woman is dedicated and devoted to husband,

00:26:24.925 --> 00:26:28.407
do you think he'll run after any other woman, he has to come back to her.

00:26:28.664 --> 00:26:30.691
You see he'll be so fed up with these 

00:26:30.829 --> 00:26:33.175
women who just live for money or anything

00:26:33.421 --> 00:26:34.486
and he has to come back.

00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:37.782
So you see one has to take a very wise decision,

00:26:37.872 --> 00:26:40.743
because you must understand you are born at a juncture,

00:26:41.747 --> 00:26:45.902
whether in, on which you will be destroyed completely,

00:26:46.589 --> 00:26:49.790
or you'll be saved completely. Is a very important thing.

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:53.176
You have to save humanity. You are born

00:26:53.211 --> 00:26:55.938
at a time when you have to save humanity.

00:26:56.326 --> 00:26:58.944
It's not only kundalini awakening

00:26:59.183 --> 00:27:01.297
that will help, because you might be saved,

00:27:01.387 --> 00:27:03.164
but you have to save the whole society,

00:27:03.421 --> 00:27:06.130
the whole family, the whole,

00:27:07.507 --> 00:27:09.658
I should say the whole universe or the whole

00:27:09.692 --> 00:27:12.729
creation will have no meaning if you people are destroyed.

00:27:13.024 --> 00:27:15.616
Now you, this is one of the way of destruction,

00:27:15.892 --> 00:27:18.701
 by destroying the family. The children become mad,

00:27:18.753 --> 00:27:19.997
the husband becomes mad,

00:27:20.157 --> 00:27:22.709
they all end up in orphanages, that's what I've seen,

00:27:22.761 --> 00:27:25.036
they are mostly in orphanages in their old age, 

00:27:25.078 --> 00:27:26.710
there's nobody to bother about you.

00:27:27.391 --> 00:27:30.885
So it's a question of giving, and giving and giving.

00:27:32.225 --> 00:27:36.516
Now this Gruhalaxshmi's centre is on the left-hand side,

00:27:37.016 --> 00:27:40.445
and the another is Raja Laxshmi centre is on the right-hand side.

00:27:40.748 --> 00:27:45.410
Now this center gives us the power to rule over people

00:27:45.502 --> 00:27:49.175
and we become very, in extremes you see we can become very arrogant

00:27:49.286 --> 00:27:54.542
 and we can become very very, sort of authoritative and we might,

00:27:54.613 --> 00:27:59.472
sort of end up with a funeral with ten thousand people behind us,

00:27:59.543 --> 00:28:05.121
all bought from market and put there behind you without any feelings,

00:28:05.192 --> 00:28:08.575
that's all finished. With such a man finished they'll say, oh thank God he died,

00:28:08.817 --> 00:28:11.395
he was a horrible terror for us.

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:16.028
So, that kind of a life can come with Raja Laxshmi.

00:28:16.099 --> 00:28:18.856
But in the center is the Laxshmi.

00:28:20.536 --> 00:28:25.658
Laxshmi is the Goddess, is the power within us, by which we balance,

00:28:25.965 --> 00:28:27.965
lead a very balanced life,

00:28:28.465 --> 00:28:30.465
by which we are satisfied.

00:28:30.965 --> 00:28:33.886
Now they have made a beautiful picture of this Laxshmi also one

00:28:33.918 --> 00:28:36.880
should understand this power is a Lady,

00:28:36.994 --> 00:28:41.132
is a Mother and She stands on a lotus. Now these are all symbols

00:28:41.224 --> 00:28:43.224
which suggest that,

00:28:43.724 --> 00:28:49.237
these symbols are carved out with such deep significance.

00:28:49.479 --> 00:28:54.195
She stands on a lotus. Means imagine, who can stand on a lotus?

00:28:54.545 --> 00:28:59.195
And She's a very healthy woman, very healthy woman and She stands on a lotus.

00:28:59.416 --> 00:29:04.048
It means that, that She is never putting pressure on anyone.

00:29:04.591 --> 00:29:07.975
A rich man comes in, he must honk his car,

00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:12.396
loudly, because he's rich so he thinks he must honk it higher,

00:29:12.896 --> 00:29:17.698
and a rich man must go in a big limousine or some sort of

00:29:17.735 --> 00:29:20.089
a thing to show off that he's very rich.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:23.085
If he comes to any program, or any he must sit in front,

00:29:23.199 --> 00:29:25.029
he should have the front seat,

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:28.581
and he makes him known everywhere everybody must feel

00:29:28.587 --> 00:29:31.718
the weight of the rich man. He can run away with ten wives,

00:29:31.896 --> 00:29:35.180
of somebody and, he can have a big

00:29:35.573 --> 00:29:39.201
boat for himself, and he can get any number of women there

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:42.297
and he can spoil any families he likes because he's rich.

00:29:43.076 --> 00:29:47.502
This kind of thing comes in in people but Laxshmi the One who has,

00:29:47.616 --> 00:29:49.616
stands on the lotus,

00:29:50.116 --> 00:29:54.462
is the beauty and the glory of the riches,

00:29:54.533 --> 00:29:56.976
that God has given that person.

00:29:57.476 --> 00:30:02.719
Then, it has got two red, pink flowers in the hand, that are

00:30:02.833 --> 00:30:07.808
lotus flowers again. Now the lotus is regarded as a very

00:30:07.922 --> 00:30:13.374
holy flower in India, because it is so receptive

00:30:13.488 --> 00:30:18.687
to everything that is crude and funny. First of all

00:30:18.758 --> 00:30:22.120
it is born in the mud. Just think of it,

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:27.044
in the mud, in the filth, where the horrible smell is coming out,

00:30:27.308 --> 00:30:28.347
the lotus is born.

00:30:29.276 --> 00:30:33.444
And the one lotus gives the fragrance, the beautiful fragrance

00:30:33.515 --> 00:30:34.723
to the whole atmosphere,

00:30:34.837 --> 00:30:37.555
and kills all that's filth and everything,

00:30:37.647 --> 00:30:41.057
and covers the whole pond with its big big leaves

00:30:41.192 --> 00:30:44.067
so that it looks a beautiful pond.

00:30:45.211 --> 00:30:48.678
That's what is the lotus for. But this lotus

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:53.743
is a pink lotus, means pink, you know is the sign of love.

00:30:54.071 --> 00:30:57.450
Pink is the sign of love. So such a person has to have

00:30:57.628 --> 00:31:00.977
tremendous love and that softness of the lotus.

00:31:01.477 --> 00:31:04.810
Now the inside of the lotus is very soft and nice

00:31:05.031 --> 00:31:10.233
and a, I don't know what do you call that, the bee, the black bee,

00:31:10.304 --> 00:31:15.491
a very big one which has got horrible,

00:31:16.699 --> 00:31:20.989
no, the black bee, it's like that, which has got

00:31:21.081 --> 00:31:24.554
angular legs and things like that, horrible, you cannot touch it.

00:31:24.754 --> 00:31:28.050
That one, can find its place in the lotus.

00:31:28.336 --> 00:31:32.771
When it goes to the lotus, the lotus opens its petals and takes it inside

00:31:33.035 --> 00:31:37.759
and makes it, sleep on the corona that it has, very soft

00:31:37.808 --> 00:31:40.192
one on the bed, and covers it nicely

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:43.804
and gives it a nice, you see,

00:31:43.832 --> 00:31:47.692
swinging feeling, that it feels it is in the lap of the mother

00:31:47.784 --> 00:31:52.414
and it sleeps off. Even such a animal, it gives a place to live.

00:31:53.257 --> 00:31:57.195
Now the man who is a laxshmipati the one who is blessed with Laxshmi,

00:31:57.437 --> 00:32:00.154
has to have a temperament like that.

00:32:00.439 --> 00:32:02.288
Anybody who comes to his house,

00:32:02.445 --> 00:32:08.311
anyone, should be very readily accepted. I've seen people like that,

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:11.228
I've seen in my lifetime, should be accepted and they should be

00:32:11.277 --> 00:32:15.557
very gratified to have such people in the house

00:32:15.628 --> 00:32:17.312
and should feel that oh God,

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:20.233
what a blessing it is that we have a guest in the house.

00:32:20.347 --> 00:32:23.970
But in modern times, we find out devices and methods,

00:32:24.084 --> 00:32:26.084
how to avoid guests,

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:29.826
guests are equal to pests.

00:32:32.126 --> 00:32:35.897
I was in London, we were living on Surrey Hills and

00:32:35.989 --> 00:32:37.869
we had bungalows, separate bungalows,

00:32:37.918 --> 00:32:40.591
quite good bungalows I should say, there were seven bungalows.

00:32:41.155 --> 00:32:43.618
And poor husbands were taken to tasks

00:32:43.659 --> 00:32:45.766
for mowing the lawns and everything and the wife used to

00:32:45.815 --> 00:32:47.449
tell them now come along do it properly

00:32:47.606 --> 00:32:48.919
and the polishing of the,

00:32:49.333 --> 00:32:52.099
brass whatever was there and everything was done very well.

00:32:52.427 --> 00:32:55.484
But I didn't see even a rat enter those houses,

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:58.284
even a rat, I mean leave alone human beings.

00:32:58.784 --> 00:33:02.540
Nothing entered those houses, only these two persons used to come out

00:33:02.847 --> 00:33:03.544
and go in.

00:33:04.044 --> 00:33:06.976
And I don't know they might be having some yearly,

00:33:07.197 --> 00:33:09.197
some sort of a get-together, maybe.

00:33:09.504 --> 00:33:14.345
But nobody, while My house was naturally, I am like this,

00:33:14.416 --> 00:33:18.650
so it was open all the time, people would come in and go out and this and that

00:33:18.785 --> 00:33:20.785
and I was just enjoying their company.

00:33:20.856 --> 00:33:21.909
And one day they asked me,

00:33:22.087 --> 00:33:24.477
what's the matter in Your house, all the time people are

00:33:24.526 --> 00:33:27.787
coming and going and used to wonder what is it going on inside.

00:33:27.944 --> 00:33:31.663
I said nothing, just they come, have tea and go, that's all, just

00:33:31.798 --> 00:33:34.522
some talk together, some rapport of love.

00:33:34.636 --> 00:33:36.506
But what is this, all the doors are closed,

00:33:36.597 --> 00:33:39.552
that way I must say Sydney people are very open hearted,

00:33:39.793 --> 00:33:44.380
and they are, they like to be together, there is a togetherness in them.

00:33:44.643 --> 00:33:48.577
But with all this, if you cannot have togetherness,

00:33:48.668 --> 00:33:50.668
to enjoy your wealth with others,

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:52.653
then what's the use of all the wealth.

00:33:52.808 --> 00:33:54.808
If you have wealth, you'll go for horse-racing,

00:33:54.985 --> 00:33:56.702
that's also your own enjoyment.

00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:00.314
If you have wealth you will do something else which is so individualistic.

00:34:00.512 --> 00:34:02.403
You cannot enjoy your wealth

00:34:02.473 --> 00:34:04.473
unless and until you share it.

00:34:04.714 --> 00:34:06.714
As I told you the other day that

00:34:06.783 --> 00:34:11.382
I am, a capitalist in the sense I have all the powers within myself.

00:34:12.507 --> 00:34:15.429
But, I cannot live without sharing it,

00:34:15.498 --> 00:34:18.527
so I am the greatest communist, because I just cannot enjoy,

00:34:18.682 --> 00:34:20.922
that's why I had to come all the way to Australia

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:24.309
and today my husband was so insistent that I should come back soon,

00:34:24.378 --> 00:34:27.917
I said: 'No, I have to meet all the Australians still, and then I'll come.'

00:34:28.137 --> 00:34:31.641
So unless and until you share this love after realization,

00:34:31.753 --> 00:34:34.231
you do not enjoy. All isms drop out, 

00:34:34.451 --> 00:34:36.967
because you become combination of both extremes,

00:34:37.232 --> 00:34:40.349
and you just start enjoying yourself.

00:34:40.569 --> 00:34:42.569
Now this lotus is in the hand

00:34:42.746 --> 00:34:47.002
and another hand that the Goddess has is like this. She has four hands,

00:34:47.243 --> 00:34:48.296
and one hand like this.

00:34:49.399 --> 00:34:52.559
Now this hand that is like this means,

00:34:52.714 --> 00:34:57.535
you see with this we must give, we must give, we must be generous.

00:34:57.669 --> 00:35:01.478
Miserly people cannot be the blessed ones,

00:35:01.633 --> 00:35:06.180
they cannot be. Miserly rich is the horridest thing that you could think of.

00:35:06.551 --> 00:35:08.551
Mean, if you see a miserly person,

00:35:09.547 --> 00:35:12.684
I mean, I don't know, I get a headache with a man like that, you see, who

00:35:12.731 --> 00:35:14.945
goes on counting each and every pi 

00:35:15.057 --> 00:35:18.176
and measuring everything, you see miserly horrible things

00:35:18.267 --> 00:35:20.894
and ultimately when they die, their children

00:35:20.918 --> 00:35:23.243
take out all their money and just spend it over.

00:35:25.683 --> 00:35:28.451
They have, miserly people have another way of 

00:35:28.498 --> 00:35:30.498
getting their money looted. For example

00:35:30.632 --> 00:35:34.207
a thief might come in, if not thief then,

00:35:34.276 --> 00:35:36.276
their children will become very wayward

00:35:36.431 --> 00:35:37.785
or something will happen,

00:35:37.919 --> 00:35:41.413
they will get sick and they'll have hand brokens and

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:44.204
feet broken or something, and they will have to spend money.

00:35:44.833 --> 00:35:49.221
So the miserly people are such a nuisance to the society.

00:35:49.419 --> 00:35:51.640
They give nothing to the society they are

00:35:51.709 --> 00:35:54.967
there for themselves and they are just malignant personalities.

00:35:55.467 --> 00:35:57.467
The people who give,

00:35:57.967 --> 00:36:00.341
not of course I don't believe into giving

00:36:00.432 --> 00:36:03.381
into somebody freely because that also can spoil people.

00:36:03.536 --> 00:36:07.038
If you give something to someone very freely,

00:36:07.085 --> 00:36:09.085
they can be completely spoilt and,

00:36:09.693 --> 00:36:12.384
they would not know how to use that money.

00:36:12.755 --> 00:36:14.755
This is the trouble with human beings is,

00:36:14.889 --> 00:36:16.889
that they cannot bear anything.

00:36:17.152 --> 00:36:18.138
If you give them money,

00:36:18.205 --> 00:36:20.812
either they'll become miserly or they become wayward.

00:36:21.161 --> 00:36:24.250
If you give them power either they become dictatorial

00:36:24.386 --> 00:36:26.621
or they become destroyers.

00:36:26.733 --> 00:36:30.089
I mean, you cannot give anything to human beings

00:36:30.201 --> 00:36:31.414
without realization.

00:36:31.677 --> 00:36:34.002
Anything they get extreme, they become mad.

00:36:34.136 --> 00:36:36.136
That's one word you can explain.

00:36:36.464 --> 00:36:39.526
Now Krishna has said, 'yoga kshema mahatmyam'.

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.748
He has said I give you Yoga,

00:36:43.011 --> 00:36:45.275
that is union with God, self-realization,

00:36:45.301 --> 00:36:47.780
and then I look after your kshema,

00:36:47.935 --> 00:36:50.956
and kshema means your well-being.

00:36:51.305 --> 00:36:54.166
This well-being is brought forth with this Laxshmi,

00:36:54.257 --> 00:36:57.214
with one hand that is giving, the another is the protection.

00:36:57.542 --> 00:37:00.700
This hand which gives, should not, the other hand should not know.

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:04.748
It should be so done so gracefully, graciously.

00:37:04.839 --> 00:37:07.443
Today only I was telling the story to some people,

00:37:08.137 --> 00:37:10.137
about my own father,

00:37:10.206 --> 00:37:13.544
who was a very generous man I've ever known.

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:17.703
And he had a habit on a Sunday afternoon he used to go,

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:20.714
he used to call all the people and say that I have to

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:23.085
give away lots of things, I have too many things in the house.

00:37:23.111 --> 00:37:25.628
He'd take out all the blankets, sometimes all the

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:29.918
utensils and sometimes food, anything that he felt like he used to give way.

00:37:30.052 --> 00:37:34.526
So people would come and he would pass on and his head was bent like that,

00:37:35.026 --> 00:37:37.026
and some people told him, what's the use, some people are

00:37:37.052 --> 00:37:39.313
taking three blankets, some are taking two blankets,

00:37:39.337 --> 00:37:42.473
you don't even see what's happening you are just giving away,

00:37:42.542 --> 00:37:44.413
please at least raise your head.

00:37:44.481 --> 00:37:46.305
So he said: 'The problem is like this,

00:37:46.439 --> 00:37:48.439
because I don't give, it's God Who is giving,

00:37:48.573 --> 00:37:49.915
I'm just standing in between.

00:37:50.049 --> 00:37:51.192
And they all are saying that

00:37:51.239 --> 00:37:53.369
you are giving you are giving, thank you, thank you.

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.460
So I feel very shy, first of all.

00:37:55.551 --> 00:37:58.829
And secondly it is the lookout of God who is giving these things

00:37:58.964 --> 00:38:01.501
to see whether one gets two or one. Why should I bother.

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:05.571
I'm just standing in between, I'm not supposed to see who takes two or one.'

00:38:06.071 --> 00:38:08.912
Such generosity I've seen, in my own lifetime.

00:38:09.046 --> 00:38:11.902
And I have seen, the more generous he was,

00:38:12.122 --> 00:38:14.813
the more generosity flew into our house.

00:38:14.925 --> 00:38:19.176
I mean, that like if you open this door from the other side it starts flowing.

00:38:19.223 --> 00:38:22.507
But some people have sixty shirts, but still they'll go

00:38:22.554 --> 00:38:24.252
to the market and buy shirts.

00:38:24.364 --> 00:38:26.364
And they'll say: 'Oh I have a weakness for shirts.'

00:38:26.648 --> 00:38:28.648
Now I don't understand this weakness

00:38:28.739 --> 00:38:30.974
of heaping up shirts after shirts.

00:38:32.573 --> 00:38:34.711
It is ridiculous, isn't it.

00:38:34.758 --> 00:38:37.385
Some of these things really are ridiculous,

00:38:37.454 --> 00:38:38.870
that I have a weakness for shoes,

00:38:38.961 --> 00:38:41.481
now you go and see the shoes are from top to bottom,

00:38:41.549 --> 00:38:44.964
you can open a shoe shop, or,

00:38:45.076 --> 00:38:48.950
it's like that, what's the use of getting so many shoes

00:38:48.997 --> 00:38:52.540
because your foot has got the same size for years now,

00:38:52.587 --> 00:38:55.177
it's not going to change, even after realization.

00:38:55.548 --> 00:38:59.948
So there is no need to, I mean if your shoes give way is all right

00:39:00.039 --> 00:39:03.769
but, I too have the same problem. That

00:39:03.881 --> 00:39:08.140
I, My disciples know that they should give me a shoe, I don't know why,

00:39:08.252 --> 00:39:10.492
they give me a shoe, all the time I go there they give me

00:39:10.518 --> 00:39:12.605
chappal or a shoe or something. I said now

00:39:12.631 --> 00:39:13.963
I've too many now what to do?

00:39:14.032 --> 00:39:16.765
They said: 'Mother return it to us we'll keep it for vibrations.'

00:39:16.899 --> 00:39:19.334
I said: 'That's a good idea,' because I have no place

00:39:19.447 --> 00:39:22.071
to keep all these shoes, I mean I am not a cobbler,

00:39:22.162 --> 00:39:23.727
I cannot do anything with it.

00:39:23.753 --> 00:39:25.365
So it is useless.

00:39:25.391 --> 00:39:27.025
Best thing is to give flowers

00:39:27.116 --> 00:39:31.398
so that I can again send them back to some ocean or to some river.

00:39:31.682 --> 00:39:35.026
So even in there, when we go on accumulating,

00:39:35.154 --> 00:39:37.698
and I must have this, you go to the shop the people are

00:39:37.767 --> 00:39:41.158
like this like this, watching everything. What is there to watch.

00:39:41.378 --> 00:39:45.197
You see whatever you want to buy you go in the shop see what you like, you have it.

00:39:45.288 --> 00:39:47.288
But sort of I must have this, I must have that.

00:39:47.549 --> 00:39:51.502
I have known a person who had ten ironing boards

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:54.934
and twenty iron in his house. All locked up.

00:39:54.974 --> 00:39:56.162
I said: 'For whom?'

00:39:56.275 --> 00:39:59.459
So she said: 'Maybe my children.' I said: 'You have only one child,

00:39:59.554 --> 00:40:01.226
God has been very miserly about you,

00:40:01.395 --> 00:40:04.839
you have only one child. And now what are you going to do with this?

00:40:04.879 --> 00:40:07.611
You'd better throw them away.' And with the electrical

00:40:07.689 --> 00:40:10.258
I mean appliances you know they go off and all that.

00:40:10.334 --> 00:40:11.199
But she would not.

00:40:11.386 --> 00:40:13.854
She could not, she used show everyone: 'See now I've got it.'

00:40:14.041 --> 00:40:16.721
Not antiques, all modern stuff, you see.

00:40:16.963 --> 00:40:19.647
And this is how the things go on accumulating

00:40:19.704 --> 00:40:22.469
which has no value aesthetically or in any way.

00:40:22.969 --> 00:40:26.370
Actually you should buy something only to give it to someone.

00:40:26.723 --> 00:40:30.864
That's the best way of enjoying it to the maximum, you see.

00:40:30.977 --> 00:40:32.977
And anybody likes it - have it.

00:40:33.017 --> 00:40:35.017
You see, that's the best way.

00:40:35.075 --> 00:40:38.662
It's a great thing, I mean I tell you it's rather difficult for you people

00:40:38.812 --> 00:40:41.660
to understand but I am one of them Wwho does that

00:40:41.773 --> 00:40:46.265
very often, and my children and my husband are rather worried you know,

00:40:46.323 --> 00:40:49.204
God knows next time what She'll give away.

00:40:50.035 --> 00:40:52.035
But you'll be amazed I've so many things,

00:40:52.075 --> 00:40:53.852
so many things, despite all this,

00:40:54.057 --> 00:40:56.911
I mean the whole time thinking what to give to whom,

00:40:56.969 --> 00:41:00.376
still it's so many things in the house, now that we have to take a bigger house.

00:41:01.134 --> 00:41:03.690
I don't know what to do with so many things

00:41:03.822 --> 00:41:07.880
and I try to thrust things on the people, Baba you take this you have liked it.

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.920
But they say: 'No no no how can you give me.'

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:12.890
But really that gives me such a pleasure,

00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:15.390
and one must learn how to do.

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:17.578
But I've have seen human beings are different.

00:41:17.654 --> 00:41:19.654
For themselves they'll buy diamonds,

00:41:19.694 --> 00:41:23.089
and for others they'll buy artificial things.

00:41:23.497 --> 00:41:24.963
It's very common you know.

00:41:25.021 --> 00:41:27.021
They will buy for, they are wearing diamonds

00:41:27.134 --> 00:41:29.711
and when it is coming to giving to others they'll give artificial.

00:41:29.772 --> 00:41:32.211
At least don't wear at that time the diamond,

00:41:32.416 --> 00:41:34.416
at least that much decency should be there.

00:41:34.677 --> 00:41:38.417
So you see when it comes to giving, give it with your full heart.

00:41:38.917 --> 00:41:40.917
You just feel that love of giving

00:41:41.343 --> 00:41:45.704
and you feel so happy, because you feel so big about yourself,

00:41:45.928 --> 00:41:49.293
like an ocean that's giving so much of clouds

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:53.348
and again it is receiving these rivers into it, and again making it into clouds,

00:41:53.517 --> 00:41:58.380
a sort of a circle of beautiful conversion into beauty

00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:00.866
after beauty starts, it's so beautiful.

00:42:01.366 --> 00:42:04.302
And that's what we should try to become,

00:42:04.434 --> 00:42:07.758
a part of that circle, which is so beautiful

00:42:07.816 --> 00:42:10.579
and which is so joy giving, to yourself also.

00:42:11.558 --> 00:42:16.644
And this is what it is, and this hand is for ashraya, means for the protection.

00:42:17.512 --> 00:42:22.153
You must protect the people who are your subordinates,

00:42:22.248 --> 00:42:25.014
who are dependent on you, your children.

00:42:25.275 --> 00:42:29.248
Like, it's a very common thing to insult your children from their childhood.

00:42:29.748 --> 00:42:31.748
Why did you spoil that carpet?

00:42:32.248 --> 00:42:35.048
Why did you do that? You should not have said this,

00:42:35.309 --> 00:42:38.570
why did you? This is a very wrong thing of discipline.

00:42:38.978 --> 00:42:42.281
Best discipline is to put dignity into children.

00:42:43.057 --> 00:42:46.667
You see, a good home in India we'll say,

00:42:46.891 --> 00:42:50.520
is known by the way children are addressed in the family.

00:42:50.689 --> 00:42:56.423
Like, in a good family we address the children like sa.

00:42:56.593 --> 00:43:02.725
Little bit like that, ap, means sa. We never address the children with indignity,

00:43:02.824 --> 00:43:05.447
and we put them on a dignified level.

00:43:06.312 --> 00:43:11.258
And it's a very nice thing. I'll tell you about my own granddaughter,

00:43:11.758 --> 00:43:18.820
that, somebody was telling her one day that, there's a very, this boy

00:43:18.919 --> 00:43:22.577
and why don't you marry him. She said: 'Why do you want to talk about marriage?

00:43:22.749 --> 00:43:26.176
I'm not yet grown at all to think about marriage,

00:43:26.348 --> 00:43:29.070
and we have to be dignified about things,

00:43:29.205 --> 00:43:32.251
how can we think of marriage when we are not to think,

00:43:32.459 --> 00:43:37.040
and my grandmother will marry me and I want to live, a dignified person.'

00:43:37.066 --> 00:43:41.242
A little girl of seven years said this to this woman who was very,

00:43:41.414 --> 00:43:44.394
sort of pseudo-intellectual type and she tried

00:43:44.456 --> 00:43:48.252
to tease my granddaughter. She said: 'It's not dignified'.

00:43:48.752 --> 00:43:52.871
Just think of that. At the age of seven years they have their sense of dignity.

00:43:53.043 --> 00:43:56.815
If you tell them, you see they, you need not tell them don't spoil the carpet,

00:43:56.987 --> 00:44:00.439
but give them dignity they will never spoil it. You'll be surprised.

00:44:00.574 --> 00:44:04.123
Because we all the time cut them short, they become so bad.

00:44:04.258 --> 00:44:07.205
They want to, they think we are good for nothing, we don't know

00:44:07.522 --> 00:44:10.105
what to do, all the time they're telling us like this.

00:44:10.204 --> 00:44:13.125
Or even if you have to tell them, tell about somebody else,

00:44:13.297 --> 00:44:15.961
like that boy, you know, he was absolutely

00:44:16.133 --> 00:44:17.819
useless, he didn't know what to do,

00:44:17.903 --> 00:44:20.379
he spoiled the whole carpet, I went to his house and slipped down.

00:44:20.434 --> 00:44:22.285
The child immediately gets the thing.

00:44:22.311 --> 00:44:24.977
But directly all the time hitting the child,

00:44:25.121 --> 00:44:27.121
you see gives him a personality

00:44:27.235 --> 00:44:29.326
which does not hold,

00:44:29.826 --> 00:44:31.826
anything substantial within.

00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:35.718
He might later on became a very arrogant person taking a cue from his parents,

00:44:35.862 --> 00:44:37.628
and he may behave the same manner,

00:44:37.712 --> 00:44:39.505
but he would not be that dignity

00:44:39.619 --> 00:44:43.521
which just is silent and is expressing and manifesting.

00:44:43.665 --> 00:44:46.603
It should be a silent dignity which just manifests,

00:44:46.687 --> 00:44:48.687
and when people see such a person,

00:44:48.801 --> 00:44:53.571
it happens, people see and say 'Oh what a man, what a dignity'.

00:44:54.071 --> 00:44:57.869
You see that's what, and they become sort of ideals for society.

00:44:58.042 --> 00:45:01.982
I think this, correcting the children is not the way,

00:45:02.096 --> 00:45:05.329
it is not disciplining, but it is making them grow.

00:45:05.621 --> 00:45:08.458
What we have to give to our children is the joy,

00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:13.730
is happiness of the family, is the complete security,

00:45:13.814 --> 00:45:16.054
a sense of complete security

00:45:16.317 --> 00:45:18.622
and you will see you'll never have teenage problems,

00:45:19.241 --> 00:45:20.943
never have teenage problem.

00:45:21.027 --> 00:45:23.027
You'll be surprised you put them anywhere,

00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:28.686
they'll be so dignified and so mature, that people will be amazed.

00:45:29.186 --> 00:45:32.184
You won't have to tell them. Even small little children I've seen,

00:45:32.684 --> 00:45:34.597
if you keep your house very clean,

00:45:35.097 --> 00:45:39.231
and also always look after it, children themselves will keep it clean.

00:45:39.386 --> 00:45:41.994
They would like to do. Because children are

00:45:42.063 --> 00:45:46.397
really the budding beauties.

00:45:46.897 --> 00:45:49.981
When we cut them we cut them at the root.

00:45:50.222 --> 00:45:52.222
They expect so much from us you see,

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:53.910
they lose all their dignity

00:45:54.094 --> 00:45:56.094
and I'll tell you try this with your children,

00:45:56.192 --> 00:45:59.631
give them dignity, you will be amazed how they behave.

00:45:59.815 --> 00:46:01.670
We say they are spoilt, I've never see

00:46:01.796 --> 00:46:04.061
children being spoilt when they are dignified.

00:46:04.245 --> 00:46:08.039
Like my own grandson is a realized soul who's a very great person and

00:46:08.108 --> 00:46:10.824
all his friends are above twenty-five years,

00:46:10.922 --> 00:46:13.983
you see he's just a five six year old boy and

00:46:14.167 --> 00:46:16.981
he doesn't like to wear any dress which has got

00:46:17.136 --> 00:46:19.885
funny faces and all that He says:

00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:22.040
'This is like a clown, I'm not a clown,

00:46:22.195 --> 00:46:25.663
I don't want to wear'. I found it very difficult in Singapore to buy

00:46:25.761 --> 00:46:26.980
a pant for him

00:46:27.135 --> 00:46:28.681
which didn't have any funny faces,

00:46:28.722 --> 00:46:31.481
because all of them had Mickey Mouse this that.

00:46:31.579 --> 00:46:34.121
And I've seen my grandchildren also,

00:46:34.276 --> 00:46:38.286
daughters, there these dolls with, you see this ducky

00:46:38.355 --> 00:46:41.429
what you call the duck sort of a face you see.

00:46:41.584 --> 00:46:43.994
They said: 'What's wrong with these dolls,

00:46:44.092 --> 00:46:47.168
they should know how to put their lips. This is not good.'

00:46:47.266 --> 00:46:50.492
I mean you see, they themselves know, that this is wrong.

00:46:50.647 --> 00:46:54.235
'She's going to go into tantrums.' That's what they say.

00:46:54.735 --> 00:46:57.353
This duck is going to go into tantrums

00:46:57.422 --> 00:46:59.307
that's why she is behaving like this,

00:46:59.347 --> 00:47:03.590
oh like that, you see they are great-grandmothers sometimes the way they

00:47:04.147 --> 00:47:06.419
do some things and the way they behave.

00:47:06.574 --> 00:47:08.574
But we must give them

00:47:08.729 --> 00:47:11.389
real love and joy and happiness,

00:47:11.717 --> 00:47:13.717
that's the thing we can give to our children

00:47:14.073 --> 00:47:18.107
and you'll be amazed that this Australia is going to be blessed with children

00:47:18.262 --> 00:47:21.438
who are very great saints,

00:47:21.536 --> 00:47:23.710
very very great saints. I know that,

00:47:23.836 --> 00:47:28.072
and you have to look after them with dignity.

00:47:28.946 --> 00:47:32.039
Very great saints are going to be born in this country,

00:47:32.079 --> 00:47:35.756
so I have to request to you, that forget your problems,

00:47:35.825 --> 00:47:40.121
husband wife problem, is nothing. Look after your children,

00:47:40.247 --> 00:47:43.725
give them dignity, give them a nest where they could live,

00:47:43.765 --> 00:47:46.494
forget because I've seen in England I've seen

00:47:46.592 --> 00:47:49.372
even an eighty-year old woman behaves like a bride

00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:52.754
I mean she doesn't get over her feeling that she was a bride.

00:47:52.823 --> 00:47:54.968
Like one of the 'Great Expectations'

00:47:55.181 --> 00:47:57.925
you must have read of Charles Dickens where there was a bride

00:47:58.079 --> 00:48:00.226
who was sitting all the time thinking she was a bride.

00:48:00.265 --> 00:48:02.002
I see that picture even today,

00:48:02.098 --> 00:48:04.098
all the time they are in bridal mood.

00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:08.541
You see you are a mother and you have to treat your children with that dignity

00:48:08.666 --> 00:48:11.341
and with that love that a mother should give.

00:48:11.466 --> 00:48:14.235
It is very difficult for some people

00:48:14.303 --> 00:48:16.156
to accept the position of a mother,

00:48:16.281 --> 00:48:18.281
they think why women should be the mothers.

00:48:18.377 --> 00:48:23.812
I said this is the greatest things look at me. Look at me.

00:48:25.004 --> 00:48:27.097
This is the greatest thing to be the mother,

00:48:27.222 --> 00:48:30.189
to love everyone, that they depend on you for

00:48:30.343 --> 00:48:33.444
love and guidance, just for love.

00:48:33.627 --> 00:48:36.379
Such a great thing to feel: 'Oh God

00:48:36.591 --> 00:48:40.732
see how much I can give, how many cups I can fill,'

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:43.030
it's such a great feeling,

00:48:43.155 --> 00:48:46.989
I wish you would know what a mother is and the,

00:48:47.489 --> 00:48:51.294
motherhood you have to learn from your children and grandchildren and expand it

00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:55.140
to the whole universe. It's such a great thing a woman has in the same way

00:48:55.236 --> 00:48:59.054
the father has to do a lot of things about which I will tell you

00:48:59.121 --> 00:49:00.795
when we go to the other center.

00:49:00.891 --> 00:49:03.859
I think I've talked at length on this center because

00:49:03.869 --> 00:49:07.181
all the time what I find these two centers are catching

00:49:07.306 --> 00:49:09.306
very much in Australia.

00:49:09.806 --> 00:49:13.803
So we have to talk about the things that are catching on this and this.

00:49:13.957 --> 00:49:17.635
And today I saw there five six children with their both the fingers in,

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:20.540
all realized children with those fingers they were sucking, 

00:49:20.636 --> 00:49:22.636
and they were showing me again sucking like that.

00:49:22.819 --> 00:49:24.819
So you can imagine how much it is,

00:49:25.319 --> 00:49:28.322
and otherwise this one and this means that

00:49:28.418 --> 00:49:31.527
you have been going to some unauthorized personality.

00:49:32.258 --> 00:49:35.818
If you are going to some unauthorized personality this thumb will be caught up,

00:49:35.914 --> 00:49:39.842
that's why children put their things in their mouths and

00:49:40.342 --> 00:49:42.342
Freud has his own nonsensical theory,

00:49:42.554 --> 00:49:46.312
but actually it is the center that is catching

00:49:46.494 --> 00:49:49.077
with these born-realized children are showing you.

00:49:50.922 --> 00:49:54.608
Now for today, I may not be able to cover other

00:49:54.972 --> 00:49:57.754
centers so much, but later on,

00:49:57.864 --> 00:49:59.762
what is the date we are having the program now?

00:50:02.201 --> 00:50:04.215
Next Monday Wednesday Friday,

00:50:04.261 --> 00:50:08.079
three days are there out of which I will cover all these centers

00:50:08.123 --> 00:50:10.790
and specially that of Christ I would like to speak,

00:50:11.127 --> 00:50:14.513
because I met some people, when I went to America

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:16.398
I was telling the people there

00:50:16.442 --> 00:50:18.125
that you are to be born again,

00:50:18.187 --> 00:50:21.311
you are to be born again and you must have your realization,

00:50:21.398 --> 00:50:24.489
so what I found whatever lecture I gave there were big big,

00:50:24.794 --> 00:50:28.626
much bigger than these you see, they had brought to tape

00:50:28.664 --> 00:50:32.715
all my speeches, and the people who organized my program told me that:

00:50:32.753 --> 00:50:36.942
'Mother you'd better get it patented or don't allow them to tape it.'

00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:40.137
I said: 'Why?' They said: 'They will be publishing these are all writers

00:50:40.175 --> 00:50:42.005
and this I said: 'Very good let them write.'

00:50:42.067 --> 00:50:46.824
But some of them started an organization called 'born again', imagine.

00:50:46.886 --> 00:50:49.848
Now if I said you have to be,

00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:53.287
then you start an organization that we are already self-certificated.

00:50:54.517 --> 00:50:57.411
You see it's a thing one should understand you are to be born again.

00:50:57.473 --> 00:51:02.206
Now Christ has said that you will be born through Me. Is a fact.

00:51:02.706 --> 00:51:06.962
Where is Christ, is here. This is the gate, see the narrow gate

00:51:07.295 --> 00:51:10.193
and your kundalini has to pass through that.

00:51:10.863 --> 00:51:14.315
Now in case it does not pass you have to say Lord's Prayer.

00:51:14.547 --> 00:51:16.547
You have to take the name of Christ

00:51:16.731 --> 00:51:18.562
and you have to adore Him,

00:51:18.744 --> 00:51:22.984
then only it passes through, shows that you have passed through Christ.

00:51:23.484 --> 00:51:26.646
You enter into the kingdom of God which is the,

00:51:27.146 --> 00:51:29.802
limbic area. So, it's a fact

00:51:30.057 --> 00:51:32.302
when He said you have to pass through Me

00:51:32.462 --> 00:51:35.478
He didn't mean that people who are self-certificated

00:51:35.565 --> 00:51:37.565
can say that: 'All right this is Christ,

00:51:37.603 --> 00:51:41.131
this is Bible this is Christ,' as if Christ is somewhere lying there,

00:51:41.266 --> 00:51:43.266
you just have to turn a stone and you get Him there.

00:51:44.179 --> 00:51:47.749
Christ is here. How do you approach Him is only

00:51:47.811 --> 00:51:51.276
through the kundalini awakening and it passes through Christ.

00:51:51.533 --> 00:51:52.573
This is the door.

00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:56.672
Now say, you are all Christians or maybe you are Jews or whatever it is,

00:51:56.904 --> 00:51:59.378
but, in India for example

00:51:59.489 --> 00:52:02.608
they have a very antagonistic feelings towards Christianity.

00:52:02.986 --> 00:52:05.108
Now even a Hindu, or a Muslim,

00:52:06.046 --> 00:52:10.542
if he denies he says all right I don't believe in Christ. He has to.

00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:12.750
I have to tell him that: 'See,

00:52:12.837 --> 00:52:15.990
if you don't believe in Christ I cannot give you realization.

00:52:16.222 --> 00:52:18.222
You have to ask for forgiveness,

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:21.459
and you have to request Christ, then only this will pass through.

00:52:21.594 --> 00:52:24.396
Now there may be Jews or Christians,

00:52:24.531 --> 00:52:27.499
any type, they have to know that all of them are here.

00:52:27.999 --> 00:52:31.122
For example there was a doctor who came from,

00:52:31.257 --> 00:52:34.542
Tehran to see me, he had cancer,

00:52:35.042 --> 00:52:38.112
and he came to see me, he had this cancer of the stomach,

00:52:38.223 --> 00:52:42.755
so I told him that: 'Do you believe that Mohammed Sahib was the same

00:52:42.817 --> 00:52:46.753
as Dattatreya or Nanaka?' He said: 'No I don't even believe,

00:52:46.864 --> 00:52:48.864
when you say that He was Moses or Abraham.

00:52:49.196 --> 00:52:51.364
I said: 'He was Moses Abraham

00:52:51.694 --> 00:52:53.694
and they are very powerful personality.

00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:55.829
Unless and until you accept,

00:52:56.016 --> 00:52:58.329
that He was Moses and Abraham,

00:52:58.829 --> 00:53:00.829
you are not going to get it.

00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:04.702
He said: 'Ah, I cannot say that,' because Jews and Muslims are like this.

00:53:05.275 --> 00:53:08.545
I said they both are the same they are very great personalities,

00:53:08.632 --> 00:53:10.632
you are just fighting for nothing at all.

00:53:10.694 --> 00:53:15.751
I know Who is Moses and I know Who is, Abraham.

00:53:16.251 --> 00:53:19.952
But he would not accept, for eight days, then his wife, you know

00:53:20.014 --> 00:53:23.027
she was wiser, she said you'd better get it, you are not well,

00:53:23.041 --> 00:53:25.585
you'll die, better get it, then they came.

00:53:25.647 --> 00:53:28.334
You see this is what happens, they are just compelled.

00:53:28.396 --> 00:53:31.501
He came: 'All right Mother what ever you say I will accept.' I said: 'Not that,

00:53:31.539 --> 00:53:34.714
from your heart you have to say,' and he was cured,

00:53:34.776 --> 00:53:36.776
for your information he was cured.

00:53:36.887 --> 00:53:38.887
So do not have any extreme ideas,

00:53:38.974 --> 00:53:41.785
They are all in there, and They are all One.

00:53:41.872 --> 00:53:46.050
Only we are fighting saying this is mine, that is mine,

00:53:46.088 --> 00:53:49.356
so this is I have just hinted that this center because I think

00:53:49.394 --> 00:53:51.295
that's a very important center

00:53:51.357 --> 00:53:54.837
as I have discussed with the void, about all these Abraham,

00:53:54.875 --> 00:53:58.171
Moses and all the Old Testament, which is so important.

00:53:58.209 --> 00:54:01.893
How, and how Christ is the One, Who,

00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:05.773
stays there, Who crucified Himself, to make a path

00:54:05.835 --> 00:54:09.327
for us to pass through, why His crucifixion was necessary.

00:54:09.365 --> 00:54:13.427
So I'll spend more time on that later on. I hope

00:54:13.514 --> 00:54:17.939
you'll make it convenient to come again, and I hope you'll get a better hall,

00:54:18.050 --> 00:54:21.670
they are feeling very warm here. Thank you very much.
