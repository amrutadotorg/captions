1
00:00:09,517 --> 00:00:12,558
There are so many Deities who are 
working out things out for you.

2
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:17,840
But you have to be, you have to be, extremely careful

3
00:00:17,921 --> 00:00:21,001
that you do not develop this fear business.

4
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:24,800
Because fear takes you to the Left side 
and once you go to the left side,

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,276
you know the problems of the Left side is 
– first of all -you go against Ganesha.

6
00:00:28,356 --> 00:00:32,477
Ganesha is standing at the base of the Left.

7
00:00:32,477 --> 00:00:36,800
And then you develop cancers, you develop 
all these things, fear, fear, fear

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,397
and emotional problems and all these things come.

9
00:00:40,477 --> 00:00:44,276
In emotions you should be bubbling with joy.

10
00:00:44,356 --> 00:00:48,880
Joy is your emotion.

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54,961
In action you should be thoughtless.

12
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:59,437
And in ascent you should be surrendered.

13
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:04,074
That’s all, it’s very simple, three mantras 
are very simple for children.

14
00:01:04,074 --> 00:01:05,176
They are like that.

15
00:01:07,847 --> 00:01:12,121
But in a deeper way, if you see who is Shri Ganesha,

16
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:18,363
He is the child of Adi Shakti.

17
00:01:19,738 --> 00:01:24,403
She created Him from the Aumkara.

18
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:28,645
Now, Aumkara is the Logos, as you call it, is the first sound

19
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:39,161
when Sadashiva and Adi Shakti separated, for creation.

20
00:01:39,847 --> 00:01:46,403
That sound is used as Aumkara which are vibrations,

21
00:01:49,161 --> 00:02:00,645
which have light in it. They have 
all the causals of all the elements,

22
00:02:01,685 --> 00:02:04,323
only on the right side.

23
00:02:04,403 --> 00:02:10,806
Then left side, it has the power of your emotions.

24
00:02:11,323 --> 00:02:15,121
In the centre it has the power of your ascent.

25
00:02:15,524 --> 00:02:25,927
So it's a very powerful deity we have and He's playful.

26
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:32,847
Children are seldom cruel. He's not cruel,

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,323
but if anything is done against the Mother, 
then He goes all wild.

28
00:02:42,645 --> 00:02:49,806
Then He punishes and that is how 
the divine justice is brought to people.

29
00:02:53,968 --> 00:02:59,202
Thus, if we surrender to Shri Ganesh, He protects us,

30
00:02:59,443 --> 00:03:04,403
He gives us wisdom, He gives a proper understanding,

31
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,645
the protocol of the Mother.

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,927
He does not know any other deity but His Mother.

33
00:03:13,766 --> 00:03:18,726
He doesn't bother about any other deity but His Mother,

34
00:03:20,202 --> 00:03:23,726
and He knows that She’s the most powerful deity.

35
00:03:25,323 --> 00:03:31,081
And this is His wisdom, which must be imbibed.

36
00:03:31,161 --> 00:03:35,645
When you pray, you must try to imbibe that.

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:46,403
For many people are still in the West 
anxious to copy other people,

38
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:51,443
fall back into the wrong ideas,

39
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:59,242
which have really kept them away from the Truth.

40
00:03:59,847 --> 00:04:03,040
Thank God you all have come out of it

41
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:08,645
and when you see the hell into which 
the Western society has fallen,

42
00:04:08,887 --> 00:04:15,242
you try to understand and enjoy that you are 
at a different state altogether.

43
00:04:15,403 --> 00:04:20,000
But still, among you there will be some 
who will be dangling.

44
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:22,847
Try to pull them out, not to throw them inside

45
00:04:22,927 --> 00:04:24,685
and go also with them.

46
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,524
If you sympathize with them, you’ll go down with them.

47
00:04:27,645 --> 00:04:31,363
Try to pull them out and tell them that „you have to come out“.

48
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:35,564
It maybe little painful to them, doesn’t matter, but they’ll be saved.

49
00:04:35,645 --> 00:04:41,202
So you are here as saviours and 
you have the power of Shri Ganesha,

50
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:44,040
which is to be used. So today's Puja

51
00:04:44,121 --> 00:04:47,524
is specially to be done with a prayer in your heart that:

52
00:04:47,605 --> 00:04:55,605
„Shri Ganesha, please be kind and merciful and forgiving

53
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,887
that You manifest within ourselves.

54
00:04:58,968 --> 00:05:03,323
Let all these hypocritical things, all these conditionings

55
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:07,766
and all these wrong ideas we have

56
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:11,363
or all the wrong life we have had,

57
00:05:11,605 --> 00:05:18,927
should just disappear like thin air, 
and let the beautiful moonlight

58
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:25,685
of your soothing qualities of innocence 
be manifested through us.”

59
00:05:26,847 --> 00:05:29,443
Let us manifest these qualities.

60
00:05:32,028 --> 00:05:37,109
So, that is how you have to be honest, 
in the essence of it,

61
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:43,754
and the essence of honesty is innocence.

62
00:05:46,592 --> 00:05:48,713
Essence of sincerity is innocence.

63
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:54,471
Essence of beauty, glory, is innocence,

64
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:04,149
and innocence is the one that gives you complete detachment.

65
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,552
So, to such a symbol of innocence, when we bow,

66
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:14,633
we must know what we have done about ourselves.

67
00:06:21,794 --> 00:06:26,189
Whatever has been your past, get out of it.

68
00:06:30,915 --> 00:06:34,875
Be just the opposite of what has been so bad before.

69
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:44,794
Strongly against all that you were before, in the darkness.

70
00:06:47,536 --> 00:06:51,760
And the another point is that:
how much magnetism you have?

71
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,097
So you reverse back to yourself.

72
00:06:54,177 --> 00:06:59,636
The magnetism is a magic, is a magic of a person.

73
00:06:59,716 --> 00:07:03,103
A person is magnetic because he has certain magic.

74
00:07:03,183 --> 00:07:10,077
Now this magic is, comes, from your own personality. 
From your own personality.

75
00:07:10,158 --> 00:07:14,326
The basis of magnetism, on the left hand side, starts.

76
00:07:14,406 --> 00:07:18,014
And that basis is Shri Ganesha.

77
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:20,792
Shri Ganesha is the basis of that magnetism.

78
00:07:20,878 --> 00:07:25,635
So you're innocent. Innocence is 
the best way to have that magnetism.

79
00:07:25,715 --> 00:07:28,948
Magnetism you cannot express in material way.

80
00:07:29,028 --> 00:07:34,796
It's not a material stuff but it is something abstract,

81
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:39,013
comes from your quality of Ganesha, Shri Ganesha.

82
00:07:39,094 --> 00:07:41,563
Such a person is magnetic.

83
00:07:41,643 --> 00:07:45,732
Magnetic means that such a person attracts other person

84
00:07:45,812 --> 00:07:49,433
because of the weight of the person,

85
00:07:49,513 --> 00:07:53,449
because of the quality of the person. Such a person attracts.

86
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:58,856
But does not attract for lust, greed and nonsensical things.

87
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:04,570
But attracts another person because of 
the fragrance of love in the subjects.

88
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,889
Now it is always confused. Confused!.

89
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:12,083
Because it's such an abstract thing so 
one must understand it in a very subtle way.

90
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:15,340
What is this magnetism? That one should understand.

91
00:08:15,553 --> 00:08:18,933
Now a Ganesha person is not a person

92
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:24,040
who is absolutely a remorse type

93
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:30,013
or a person who is such a gone case that even if you beat him up

94
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:37,354
and make him into a complete minced thing, 
he will bear it. It's not like that!

95
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:42,435
It's not that. On the contrary the quality of magnetism is such

96
00:08:42,515 --> 00:08:48,915
that it attracts you, to a point where you are not disturbed.

97
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,828
Now this is a very important point we should know.

98
00:08:51,909 --> 00:08:57,449
You see, if you have other loves, love 
like carnal love and all other love you have,

99
00:08:57,548 --> 00:09:02,123
then that love you may attract the person. 
That person can destroy you

100
00:09:02,203 --> 00:09:05,249
and it destroys you, always.

101
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:10,785
But this attraction does not destroy, does not destroy.

102
00:09:10,865 --> 00:09:15,311
The attraction is up to that point that you are not destroyed,

103
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:19,898
because you being much higher, much deeper and much weightier,

104
00:09:19,978 --> 00:09:23,563
you cannot be destroyed by a thing that you are attracting.

105
00:09:23,644 --> 00:09:28,351
Always the greater magnet attracts the smaller magnet.

106
00:09:28,431 --> 00:09:30,603
And that is what one should understand.

107
00:09:30,684 --> 00:09:38,507
This magic and this karishma, the charismatic 
temperament of a person

108
00:09:38,587 --> 00:09:43,180
comes by, first of all, the Ganesh tattwa, innocence.

109
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:49,577
And secondly by complete dedication and devotion.

110
00:09:49,658 --> 00:09:54,811
Those who are completely dedicated 
and devoted to Mother.

111
00:09:54,891 --> 00:09:56,905
Not to anything else.

112
00:09:56,985 --> 00:09:58,498
Ganesh tattwa again.

113
00:09:58,578 --> 00:10:03,655
Not to your wife, not to your husband, 
not to your sister, not to your country,

114
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:07,108
not to anyone but to Mother.

115
00:10:07,188 --> 00:10:15,332
Complete dedication gives you that charisma,

116
00:10:15,412 --> 00:10:18,011
or that attraction.

117
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,920
Now how innocence develops in a person is by not thinking about it.

118
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,725
Like, you see, somebody asked me,

119
00:10:26,805 --> 00:10:32,389
'How do you manage your Income Tax?' 
I said, 'By having no income at all'.

120
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,182
Then they asked me, 'How do you solve your car problem?'

121
00:10:35,262 --> 00:10:37,561
"By not having any car at all of mine."

122
00:10:37,642 --> 00:10:41,080
They said, 'What about your house problem?" 
"By having no house of my own."

123
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,987
"Nihi, Nihi." Everything Nihi for me.

124
00:10:45,086 --> 00:10:48,462
Then how do you solve your this problem? 
By not having it,

125
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:53,414
just have -- "No, not have it!" 
Don't take up headaches upon yourself.

126
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:59,431
See when you take up headaches upon yourself 
then only the innocence is reduced.

127
00:10:59,512 --> 00:11:03,468
That headaches like this, "This is my shawl, this is my sari,

128
00:11:03,548 --> 00:11:07,035
this is my thing, this is this, this is this, this is this".

129
00:11:07,115 --> 00:11:11,277
But only one thing is that "This is my Mother

130
00:11:11,357 --> 00:11:17,645
and I have to proclaim Her", that's all.

131
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:22,440
If that is the way it is, then innocence

132
00:11:22,547 --> 00:11:25,911
starts rising like Shri Ganesha,

133
00:11:25,991 --> 00:11:31,848
and by having no other headache. 
"This is mine, that is mine."

134
00:11:31,932 --> 00:11:34,526
This 'mine' business causes the problem, I think.

135
00:11:34,606 --> 00:11:37,046
Personally, I think this must be the reason.

136
00:11:37,126 --> 00:11:41,585
That this 'mine' business. 'This is mine.' 
Because whatever is mine.

137
00:11:41,665 --> 00:11:44,805
Somebody told me, this is very good 
argument he gave,

138
00:11:44,885 --> 00:11:48,755
"Whatever is mine is not I", means that is not Sahaja.

139
00:11:48,848 --> 00:11:52,652
My body, my head, my everything -- 'my'. But 'I'

140
00:11:52,732 --> 00:11:54,350
He gave me this idea -- 'I'.

141
00:11:54,431 --> 00:11:58,105
What is 'I'? Then 'I' is separating,

142
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:02,290
Whatever is not mine is 'I'. So what remains is your Spirit.

143
00:12:02,371 --> 00:12:06,200
Somebody gave me this argument. I said 
"Is a very good argument to work it out".

144
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,020
Then whatever remains is the 'I'

145
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,228
and that 'I' is the one we have to see!

146
00:12:15,308 --> 00:12:18,308
So you go on reducing all these 'mines', 'mines', 'mines'.

147
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:22,710
So the pure spirit of innocence will rise.

148
00:12:23,401 --> 00:12:29,170
Spiritual person is just innocent, just innocent.

149
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,914
There is no intelligence, nothing. Just innocent.

150
00:12:33,013 --> 00:12:36,642
The whole thing is innocence. 
See, whatever he talks or says,

151
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:40,527
comes through innocence. It doesn't have intellect as such,

152
00:12:40,607 --> 00:12:43,047
which here people have through reading

153
00:12:43,127 --> 00:12:45,907
and through understanding and by analysing.

154
00:12:45,987 --> 00:12:51,560
Nothing of the kind. 
It just has pure and simple innocence.

155
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,733
And it all works out very well. It is so clean.

156
00:12:55,826 --> 00:13:03,997
It just says what it knows and what it knows is the highest.

157
00:13:04,668 --> 00:13:10,142
So this deconditioning has to be brought within us.

158
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:13,097
But you should not discuss it among yourselves also.

159
00:13:13,177 --> 00:13:17,289
Once you start discussing then you also, you see,

160
00:13:17,369 --> 00:13:22,141
it becomes sort of a theological argumentation.

161
00:13:22,221 --> 00:13:24,817
There is no theology about it. It's very simple.

162
00:13:24,897 --> 00:13:29,037
It's the simplest thing is to be innocent.

163
00:13:29,117 --> 00:13:31,897
But the innocence is lost. Why?

164
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:36,636
Because our attention is in different way,
we are attentive to other things.

165
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:39,096
We are looking at other things.

166
00:13:39,177 --> 00:13:41,377
It is so simple.

167
00:13:41,484 --> 00:13:47,755
So you can...it's like a fifth column, you see.

168
00:13:47,835 --> 00:13:50,817
The innocence is a fifth column within you.

169
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:55,517
So if any person is innocent, you see he'll work on your fifth column

170
00:13:55,597 --> 00:13:58,817
and will make you all right. 
When you give bandhan to others,

171
00:13:58,897 --> 00:14:03,352
what happens, you actually bind him by your innocence

172
00:14:03,432 --> 00:14:05,375
and the poor fellow doesn't know.

173
00:14:05,455 --> 00:14:08,888
He has his innocence within him, you capture that innocence,

174
00:14:08,969 --> 00:14:11,697
that is all you have done, that's how you manage.

175
00:14:11,777 --> 00:14:14,438
It's very simple to work out things.

176
00:14:14,524 --> 00:14:21,016
Only principle, the tattwa, the whole thing rests on what?

177
00:14:21,096 --> 00:14:24,882
Tattwa is nothing but innocence.

178
00:14:24,942 --> 00:14:28,067
So try to develop this by all these things...

179
00:14:28,147 --> 00:14:30,687
"Ya neti, neti wachane nigamor awachus"

180
00:14:30,767 --> 00:14:34,320
By saying "Not this, not this, not this, not this, not this,"

181
00:14:34,405 --> 00:14:38,653
to all your thoughts. "Not this not this, not this, not this".

182
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:44,489
You reach there. 'Not mine, not mine, not mine, not mine".

183
00:14:47,055 --> 00:14:51,625
And that is how it is. And you see the whole material world

184
00:14:51,705 --> 00:14:58,687
is now attacking the innocence, because they are frightened.

185
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:03,170
You cannot attack it. Innocence cannot be destroyed. 
It cannot be destroyed.

186
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:07,411
Innocence is something [which] is all pervading

187
00:15:07,492 --> 00:15:09,166
and it cannot be destroyed.

188
00:15:09,247 --> 00:15:11,607
So whatever people may try, it cannot be destroyed.

189
00:15:11,687 --> 00:15:16,251
But it can be covered, it can recede,

190
00:15:16,331 --> 00:15:20,465
but it cannot be destroyed. It will act it's own way.

191
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:26,737
So try to develop that innocence which is 
the basis of Mahalakshmi Tattwa,

192
00:15:26,817 --> 00:15:31,449
we should say, or that is essence 
of Mahalakshmi tattva.

193
00:15:31,522 --> 00:15:36,856
So outwardly it is Mahalakshmi tattwa, but inside, inside is,

194
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,630
we can say, there are three cores.

195
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:43,443
The first core is Mahalakshmi tattwa, 
outside to look at, you see the growth, all right.

196
00:15:43,523 --> 00:15:51,204
Then inside is the creation, that is all the elements 
being created and all that.

197
00:15:51,266 --> 00:16:00,557
But inside that is the desire and inside the desire
is the half one, you can say,

198
00:16:00,637 --> 00:16:04,717
is the Ganesha.

199
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:09,287
So this Ganesh tattwa ultimately overpowers everything

200
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:12,793
and permeates everything.

201
00:16:12,874 --> 00:16:17,222
And this is, I would say that, don't think about it.

202
00:16:17,302 --> 00:16:20,813
Just allow your innocence to grow,

203
00:16:20,907 --> 00:16:25,368
Simple innocence. And your dignity.

204
00:16:25,448 --> 00:16:27,829
That's very important to have your dignity.
