00:12.320 --> 00:19.430
and also the idea is to give more

00:16.289 --> 00:21.989
encouragement to handicrafts and to art

00:19.430 --> 00:26.250
because so many times have told that a

00:21.989 --> 00:28.590
little of clay you can take and make it

00:26.250 --> 00:31.860
into a beautiful thing which is worth

00:28.590 --> 00:34.039
such a lot so why should we exhaust this

00:31.860 --> 00:37.680
mother earth why not we have few

00:34.039 --> 00:40.890
artistic nice things instead of I am so

00:37.680 --> 00:43.440
many things but you should go in the

00:40.890 --> 00:45.989
shops I don't get anything don't get

00:43.440 --> 00:48.540
silly you cannot get this you cannot get

00:45.989 --> 00:51.870
that so difficult to get anything

00:48.540 --> 00:56.610
natural because people have only making

00:51.870 --> 00:59.489
unnatural things whatever it is in that

00:56.610 --> 01:01.440
also you should create beauty if you

00:59.489 --> 01:04.890
start creating beauty then we'll try to

01:01.440 --> 01:06.960
preserve it and use it sparingly instead

01:04.890 --> 01:10.049
of having thousands of nonsensical

01:06.960 --> 01:12.299
things everything is possible after

01:10.049 --> 01:15.360
sometime we will have to have human

01:12.299 --> 01:17.009
beings who are disposable you'll have to

01:15.360 --> 01:19.229
dispose them off how will they live on

01:17.009 --> 01:22.829
this earth if you do not understand that

01:19.229 --> 01:27.779
we have to live it on this earth with

01:22.829 --> 01:31.079
its limitations seven telling you many a

01:27.779 --> 01:34.649
times take two artistic things take two

01:31.079 --> 01:38.939
handmade things more two handmade don't

01:34.649 --> 01:44.429
go too much at least even if you have to

01:38.939 --> 01:48.529
buy something which is say artificial at

01:44.429 --> 01:48.529
least see really that it is artistic

01:53.990 --> 02:02.420
so the once you have a great desire

01:59.930 --> 02:04.909
today is the day they want the whole

02:02.420 --> 02:06.920
world to pray for the preservation of

02:04.909 --> 02:09.770
Mother Earth that's why I started this

02:06.920 --> 02:13.190
topic that we should pray that we all

02:09.770 --> 02:16.849
should develop art develop for ourselves

02:13.190 --> 02:21.590
give as presents to others and also to

02:16.849 --> 02:26.180
use artistic things made of artists we

02:21.590 --> 02:34.220
can have few things but artistic which

02:26.180 --> 02:36.489
expresses art not cheap things in the

02:34.220 --> 02:39.890
whole of France

02:36.489 --> 02:43.190
what I saw was that into everything

02:39.890 --> 02:49.970
these plastics are scripted whether it

02:43.190 --> 02:52.280
is God it can enter into everybody

02:49.970 --> 02:57.620
everywhere except for the brains of

02:52.280 --> 03:03.140
human beings it's horrible so whatever

02:57.620 --> 03:12.049
it is in that also see that you my

03:03.140 --> 03:16.160
artistic things not plain horrible cheap

03:12.049 --> 03:19.370
things all right so this is what we have

03:16.160 --> 03:21.890
to today also you have to pray to me

03:19.370 --> 03:26.900
when you are doing puja that our mother

03:21.890 --> 03:29.989
our mother please save our earth give

03:26.900 --> 03:33.620
people wisdom that they should behave

03:29.989 --> 03:35.720
themselves and they should be conscious

03:33.620 --> 03:39.709
and every sahaja yogi should be

03:35.720 --> 03:43.970
conscious about how much energy he is

03:39.709 --> 03:49.489
using of electricity of telephones or of

03:43.970 --> 03:52.280
water or of anything we have to be

03:49.489 --> 03:55.670
frugal about it if you do not take the

03:52.280 --> 03:57.530
responsibility of these things then it

03:55.670 --> 04:00.579
will not penetrate anywhere else so it

03:57.530 --> 04:00.579
is for you to do

04:02.700 --> 04:11.260
you have potato in your everyday life as

04:06.370 --> 04:14.170
a part and parcel of your life that you

04:11.260 --> 04:14.970
try to save the energy of this Mother

04:14.170 --> 04:18.750
Earth

04:14.970 --> 04:18.750
it's very important
