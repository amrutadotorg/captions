00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.430
and also the idea is to give more

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.989
encouragement to handicrafts and to art

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:26.250
because so many times have told that a

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:28.590
little of clay you can take and make it

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.860
into a beautiful thing which is worth

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.039
such a lot so why should we exhaust this

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.680
mother earth why not we have few

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:40.890
artistic nice things instead of I am so

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.440
many things but you should go in the

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.989
shops I don't get anything don't get

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.540
silly you cannot get this you cannot get

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.870
that so difficult to get anything

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:56.610
natural because people have only making

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.489
unnatural things whatever it is in that

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.440
also you should create beauty if you

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.890
start creating beauty then we'll try to

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.960
preserve it and use it sparingly instead

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.049
of having thousands of nonsensical

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.299
things everything is possible after

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.360
sometime we will have to have human

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.009
beings who are disposable you'll have to

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.229
dispose them off how will they live on

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.829
this earth if you do not understand that

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:27.779
we have to live it on this earth with

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:31.079
its limitations seven telling you many a

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:34.649
times take two artistic things take two

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:38.939
handmade things more two handmade don't

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:44.429
go too much at least even if you have to

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:48.529
buy something which is say artificial at

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.529
least see really that it is artistic

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:02.420
so the once you have a great desire

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.909
today is the day they want the whole

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.920
world to pray for the preservation of

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.770
Mother Earth that's why I started this

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.190
topic that we should pray that we all

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:16.849
should develop art develop for ourselves

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:21.590
give as presents to others and also to

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:26.180
use artistic things made of artists we

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:34.220
can have few things but artistic which

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:36.489
expresses art not cheap things in the

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.890
whole of France

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:43.190
what I saw was that into everything

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:49.970
these plastics are scripted whether it

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:52.280
is God it can enter into everybody

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:57.620
everywhere except for the brains of

00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:03.140
human beings it's horrible so whatever

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:12.049
it is in that also see that you my

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:16.160
artistic things not plain horrible cheap

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:19.370
things all right so this is what we have

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.890
to today also you have to pray to me

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:26.900
when you are doing puja that our mother

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:29.989
our mother please save our earth give

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:33.620
people wisdom that they should behave

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.720
themselves and they should be conscious

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.709
and every sahaja yogi should be

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:43.970
conscious about how much energy he is

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:49.489
using of electricity of telephones or of

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:52.280
water or of anything we have to be

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:55.670
frugal about it if you do not take the

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.530
responsibility of these things then it

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.579
will not penetrate anywhere else so it

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.579
is for you to do

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:11.260
you have potato in your everyday life as

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:14.170
a part and parcel of your life that you

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.970
try to save the energy of this Mother

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.750
Earth

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.750
