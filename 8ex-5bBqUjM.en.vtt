01:46.900 --> 01:53.030
In India they were all waiting for the monsoons

01:54.780 --> 01:57.230
and they are so worried

01:58.570 --> 02:00.860
because the rain did not come.

02:02.030 --> 02:06.900
So, I was giving bandhan to the rain and it came here

02:20.030 --> 02:23.730
And now also they have  told,

02:24.190 --> 02:27.860
on the television, that it is going to rain in India.

02:28.980 --> 02:30.980
But first in Italy!

02:37.190 --> 02:41.190
I was told that in Italy you needed rain very much

02:42.070 --> 02:45.030
and the first rain you had,

02:47.940 --> 02:52.900
few days back, and now this the second one.

02:54.230 --> 03:02.780
Because all the understanding

03:04.190 --> 03:12.650
of the problems of our farmers is there.

03:15.570 --> 03:18.650
And the rain, you see, is so kind

03:20.190 --> 03:26.900
that it works at the right time.

03:28.230 --> 03:30.190
I am surprised

03:31.570 --> 03:38.530
at the quick behaviour and obedience of the rain.

03:43.530 --> 03:47.070
Today is a great day, for all of us,  because

03:47.730 --> 03:51.980
we are celebrating the Guru Puja

03:52.860 --> 03:55.820
and remembering all the great Gurus

03:57.110 --> 04:03.070
who came on this earth to teach the world about the truth.

04:04.940 --> 04:07.900
So many of them were [there].

04:08.980 --> 04:11.110
And they tried their level best

04:12.190 --> 04:16.070
to explain to humanity what is spirituality.

04:17.570 --> 04:23.570
But it’s such a disparity that people never understood

04:24.110 --> 04:28.530
that spirituality is the most important thing we need.

04:29.650 --> 04:32.820
That we have to be one with the Divine Power.

04:33.610 --> 04:37.570
All their endeavours have been in the wrong direction.

04:39.860 --> 04:46.860
First of course they were very intelligent, more than animals,

04:47.570 --> 04:53.900
and started seeking, not the truth,

04:55.030 --> 04:57.900
but some sort of a self

04:58.730 --> 05:01.940
-emancipation I should say, I don’t know  what to say, call it –

05:02.860 --> 05:04.940
self-progress.

05:06.070 --> 05:10.860
And in that they lost that they have to first seek spirituality,

05:11.820 --> 05:14.030
which is the most important thing.

05:16.530 --> 05:24.730
But, we had two types of journeys:

05:26.570 --> 05:34.610
one is through the left side or another through the right side.

05:36.730 --> 05:39.650
In India, I don’t know why,

05:40.070 --> 05:46.070
we had lots of people who went into the jungles and became saints

05:47.190 --> 05:50.980
but they were doing right side tapasya.

05:52.860 --> 05:57.940
That is, going into the five elements

05:59.190 --> 06:03.940
one after another; and mastering the five elements.

06:04.980 --> 06:09.860
Of course there is truth in it, no doubt.

06:10.940 --> 06:14.070
You have seen how a candle

06:20.150 --> 06:26.150
how a candle tells you as to what is your position inside:

06:27.530 --> 06:30.650
if you are possessed or if you are not,

06:30.940 --> 06:33.820
a candle can tell you – can you imagine?

06:34.690 --> 06:39.820
Candle is so much knowledgable.

06:41.070 --> 06:48.110
Supposing you have a heart, heart trouble –

06:48.730 --> 06:50.730
the candle will show.

06:52.230 --> 06:59.230
And if you treat yourself with a candle, you can cure yourself.

07:00.820 --> 07:05.820
So, it is so sensitive

07:06.230 --> 07:10.190
not that it can cure, but also so competent,

07:11.030 --> 07:14.940
not that it shows you that you are sick and you have problems

07:15.110 --> 07:17.900
but that it is competent to cure you.

07:19.860 --> 07:26.780
Thats why, in India, Agni was worshipped,

07:27.650 --> 07:33.690
this  light was worshipped,

07:34.030 --> 07:37.780
the fire was worshipped, that was worshipped first.

07:39.730 --> 07:45.690
They must have discovered that the fire knows everything,

07:48.570 --> 07:54.820
so the inner, inner awareness of all these elements,

07:56.150 --> 08:02.030
they knew about it and thats why they worshipped those elements.

08:03.230 --> 08:10.900
So before the Puja they used to call all the Deities who belonged

08:11.690 --> 08:17.110
to those elements to witness their Puja.

08:19.150 --> 08:22.150
But that turned out to be right sided movement.

08:26.070 --> 08:31.110
Without the left side right side is very dangerous.

08:34.190 --> 08:38.860
If you don’t have right side of course

08:39.650 --> 08:44.730
it’s a big dangerous thing also. But first you must have

08:45.860 --> 08:48.860
development of your left side.

08:51.030 --> 08:54.110
That is what, to begin with, we had in Sahaja Yoga.

08:55.230 --> 09:03.030
Left side is compassion, is love, universal feeling,

09:04.860 --> 09:09.780
or we can say it’s the blessings of the Devi

09:10.570 --> 09:14.900
which are described you know it, in the Devi Mahatmyam,

09:15.900 --> 09:20.780
that the Goddess resides within you as so many things.

09:22.820 --> 09:25.940
She resides within you as shraddha.

09:26.780 --> 09:30.900
as, She resides in you as sleep,

09:32.530 --> 09:36.070
She resides in you as illusion, bhranti.

09:36.230 --> 09:39.900
All kinds of things are there on the left-hand side,

09:40.230 --> 09:43.150
which are already described.

09:43.980 --> 09:48.570
And when I told you about Sahaja Yoga,

09:48.980 --> 09:52.820
I wanted to make your left side very strong.

09:54.150 --> 09:57.860
Those who, people who, took to right side

09:58.190 --> 10:03.070
became very aggressive people, and they had mastered

10:03.610 --> 10:07.780
the essence of these five elements, that’s alright. But

10:08.940 --> 10:11.900
they were extremely hot-tempered,

10:12.860 --> 10:17.980
so much so that they used to curse people, curse them.

10:18.860 --> 10:23.820
They used to say things which were not kind;

10:24.730 --> 10:27.650
and they didn’t believe in the universality.

10:29.070 --> 10:34.110
It was such a dangerous thing that they took.

10:35.650 --> 10:39.820
In Indian shastras you can see many incidents

10:40.570 --> 10:45.230
where people gave a curse, sharp, very common.

10:46.070 --> 10:49.820
All these gurus used to curse a person,

10:51.860 --> 10:57.030
because they had no compassion, no love, nothing but they had powers

10:57.230 --> 11:01.780
of the right side. But we have seen now

11:02.530 --> 11:04.780
that those people who have right side,

11:05.070 --> 11:08.110
who go only on the right side without the bhakti,

11:08.980 --> 11:14.610
without the blessings of the Divine,

11:16.780 --> 11:18.940
can become rakshasas actually,

11:21.150 --> 11:26.150
can become a great danger for humanity.

11:33.860 --> 11:38.230
This is a very serious thing:

11:39.900 --> 11:44.780
through your intelligence, through your thinking power,

11:44.940 --> 11:47.980
your ego can go to any limit

11:48.900 --> 11:51.860
and create problems within you.

11:52.730 --> 11:55.730
Now the ultimate of this problem is,

11:56.650 --> 11:59.650
we have seen is, are many diseases,

11:59.940 --> 12:02.860
which are absolutely incurable.

12:06.070 --> 12:09.820
Even some people, right-sided, some people,

12:10.190 --> 12:14.940
can get a kind of a cancer called blood cancer.

12:16.190 --> 12:19.150
And this blood cancer, now we have cured it,

12:19.940 --> 12:23.230
but even if it is cured you can go back

12:23.690 --> 12:25.980
to that kind of aggressiveness

12:26.230 --> 12:28.780
thinking that you are very right.

12:29.570 --> 12:32.690
Such people always try to find faults with others,

12:34.070 --> 12:41.530
that such and such person is not good, he’s doing harm,

12:41.820 --> 12:45.730
or any way they can find faults with others, not with themselves.

12:46.570 --> 12:49.900
Their attention is outside, not on themselves.

12:50.190 --> 12:52.730
They never see what’s wrong with them,

12:52.900 --> 12:55.980
but they always see what’s wrong with others.

12:56.570 --> 12:59.780
By doing that, you see, they are climbing the ladder

13:00.570 --> 13:05.980
of a horrible right side, which can give you horrible diseases.

13:06.980 --> 13:09.650
As I’ve told you, first is the blood cancer.

13:11.110 --> 13:15.900
If you get rid of the blood cancer then

13:16.650 --> 13:22.030
you can get into another problems. Nowadays there’s a very famous

13:22.530 --> 13:24.980
disease called Alzheimers.

13:26.230 --> 13:28.980
This is also the side of the right side;

13:29.860 --> 13:33.690
because if you don’t have that bhakti, that humility,

13:34.650 --> 13:38.730
that blessings of the Goddess,

13:39.650 --> 13:43.650
you can develop all such horrible diseases

13:44.070 --> 13:46.690
which are not only fatal,

13:47.570 --> 13:50.570
but also very injurious to others.

13:51.150 --> 13:57.610
So by being right-sided you do not progress.

13:58.230 --> 14:02.610
You can become a big ascetic, they call it,

14:03.690 --> 14:07.110
who can curse others,

14:08.070 --> 14:12.730
who can put them into troubles,

14:14.690 --> 14:17.780
think that that is a great power – it is not!

14:19.230 --> 14:21.230
It is not at all.

14:22.150 --> 14:28.030
Because, though you are not suppressed

14:28.980 --> 14:32.070
by other powers, negative powers,

14:33.230 --> 14:38.650
but your own power takes your life.

14:42.150 --> 14:45.650
So Kundalini, when it is arisen,

14:46.730 --> 14:50.690
the best thing is to go to the left side,

14:52.570 --> 14:57.530
not criticising others, not talking ill of others,

14:57.940 --> 15:00.860
but seeing within you, what’s wrong.

15:03.110 --> 15:08.230
Find out what is the matter with you.

15:09.650 --> 15:12.150
First it starts with self-importance,

15:13.070 --> 15:15.570
that “I am a very important person,”

15:16.570 --> 15:19.690
and with this self-importance you go on

15:20.150 --> 15:24.030
troubling everyone and torturing everyone, and all that.

15:24.650 --> 15:27.570
But because of your right-side movement,

15:28.570 --> 15:30.980
you can become very successful.

15:31.820 --> 15:34.690
Hitler was the climax of that.

15:36.150 --> 15:42.650
And that’s how people start taking to very, very cruel things.

15:44.610 --> 15:49.690
Nowadays, I think that some people are

15:52.530 --> 15:58.570
ruling  everywhere with their right side.

16:00.610 --> 16:07.650
We do not have people who are using their left side.

16:08.980 --> 16:13.900
And whenever they use their left side they are called as saints.

16:15.650 --> 16:18.900
Now you all have the powers of the left side.

16:20.030 --> 16:24.690
Some of you do have little bit right side also, doesn’t matter.

16:28.980 --> 16:32.820
Now I would say that you have achieved

16:33.110 --> 16:35.570
your left side mastery:

16:36.980 --> 16:40.860
Kundalini awakening is there, you are one with the Divine.

16:41.190 --> 16:46.110
Now you can come to the right side and know about right side,

16:48.570 --> 16:52.570
and try to express your right side.

16:54.070 --> 16:58.610
You can express it not by dominating others but dominating yourself.

16:59.110 --> 17:01.070
By self-examination.

17:02.030 --> 17:06.860
By understanding what’s wrong with you. Why do you behave like that?

17:07.650 --> 17:13.860
Why do you trouble others? Why do you overpower others?

17:14.610 --> 17:17.610
Such people will always, I have seen, organise

17:17.820 --> 17:20.070
and arrange, and do this and do that.

17:21.940 --> 17:25.030
Instead of organising themselves they’ll organise others.

17:26.650 --> 17:28.980
These things complicate.

17:31.570 --> 17:36.190
But if you have love and if you have bhakti,

17:36.690 --> 17:39.690
you can very, very easily

17:42.860 --> 17:48.780
dominate  others in a very different manner.

17:51.070 --> 17:57.980
It is not that you dominate by cruelty,

17:59.860 --> 18:05.820
by oppression, but you dominate with your love.

18:07.690 --> 18:09.940
And you don’t want to dominate,

18:10.690 --> 18:13.780
but easily people get very much succumbed

18:14.690 --> 18:20.690
to love and to magnanimity, to generosity.

18:21.900 --> 18:25.860
So all these qualities you must first develop within yourself:

18:26.730 --> 18:31.650
is the left-side problem, that – you should be very peaceful,

18:32.820 --> 18:36.820
you should give love to others, you should be generous,

18:37.650 --> 18:42.690
you should be kind, and see how much it pays.

18:44.230 --> 18:49.110
I’ve seen some people who are extremely rude,

18:51.110 --> 18:54.900
they can be rude to anyone, that’s their nature,

18:55.650 --> 18:58.570
which they should overcome with the left side.

18:59.530 --> 19:02.110
Rudeness is not the sign of a saint.

19:03.730 --> 19:06.030
A saint is extremely peaceful,

19:06.860 --> 19:10.030
and never gets rude with others.

19:10.780 --> 19:13.860
So the introspection should work first of all,

19:14.530 --> 19:17.980
“Where are we wrong? What wrong things we are doing?

19:18.940 --> 19:20.820
What is our style?”

19:21.820 --> 19:25.820
Once you discover that your style is already left-side,

19:26.230 --> 19:28.860
then you should take to right side

19:29.150 --> 19:31.980
and possess the power of right side.

19:39.650 --> 19:42.570
What are the powers of right side now

19:43.820 --> 19:49.650
which are achieved through the left-side perfection?

19:50.940 --> 19:54.900
We have some very great Gurus on this line.

19:55.980 --> 19:59.900
One of them was Raja Janaka.

20:02.070 --> 20:04.570
He was a ruler of a country,

20:04.900 --> 20:11.030
and a very well-known ruler and everything; but still, still,

20:12.030 --> 20:15.690
though He was so generous and good and everything,

20:16.940 --> 20:22.730
but at the same time He was a great monarch,

20:22.980 --> 20:27.070
great king of those days,

20:29.070 --> 20:35.900
very much known for His impartiality,  for His statesmanship

20:36.690 --> 20:42.110
and all kinds of beautiful things He did for His

20:46.150 --> 20:51.570
subjects. That is there, is Raja Janaka.

20:51.730 --> 20:54.110
He could not get disturbed with anything.

20:55.940 --> 20:58.690
And people never understood

20:58.860 --> 21:02.820
why the greatest of greatest saints used to bow to Him.

21:03.730 --> 21:08.980
What was so great? Though He was a king, He was living so lavishly

21:09.820 --> 21:13.570
and He had so many of ornaments and

21:13.900 --> 21:16.780
also conveyances and all that;

21:17.780 --> 21:20.980
because nothing was above Him,

21:21.900 --> 21:23.980
He was so detached with everything.

21:24.820 --> 21:28.650
He had everything, but He was so detached.

21:29.030 --> 21:31.820
That’s a very good example of a person

21:32.150 --> 21:37.570
who had mastered His left, and now who was the king,

21:37.780 --> 21:39.690
Raja Janaka, was there.

21:40.150 --> 21:43.860
Like that we had many people later on also,

21:44.730 --> 21:50.820
one after another, who were extremely, extremely rich,

21:51.650 --> 21:57.150
extremely, I should say, powerful as kings,

21:57.780 --> 22:01.730
but inside they were

22:02.070 --> 22:07.650
absolutely like divine personality.

22:09.230 --> 22:14.650
Nothing disturbed them, nothing made them feel greater or happier.

22:15.030 --> 22:20.780
No position, no power was to them great.

22:22.110 --> 22:29.110
This is a complete emancipation of human beings,

22:29.860 --> 22:33.730
that you are realised soul.

22:34.650 --> 22:40.690
You should be fully equipped with compassion love and understanding.

22:41.610 --> 22:46.860
But at the same time, it should be expressed in the right way.

22:47.980 --> 22:52.690
For example, we can say Christ, He’s another example.

22:53.820 --> 22:57.610
Though He was an Incarnation, still

22:58.570 --> 23:05.940
the amount of forgiveness and love He has for people is tremendous.

23:06.820 --> 23:08.690
But at the same time,

23:08.860 --> 23:13.690
He used to go on the mountains and preach about spirituality.

23:15.530 --> 23:17.690
Those were not very safe times,

23:17.900 --> 23:21.940
because people didn’t like anybody talking like that.

23:22.650 --> 23:25.900
They hated Him because He talked about God.

23:26.940 --> 23:29.820
And what they did to Him you know very well.

23:30.900 --> 23:32.570
Doesn’t matter.

23:32.780 --> 23:35.940
Though they crucified Him, still

23:36.820 --> 23:41.030
we all respect Him as a great personality.

23:42.070 --> 23:47.570
Reason is, He was, He was no doubt an Incarnation,

23:49.070 --> 23:54.650
but still He went all out to give His achievements or

23:54.820 --> 23:58.030
I can say, whatever powers He had, to others.

23:59.030 --> 24:03.570
He went all over the places, He had no facilities,

24:03.820 --> 24:07.650
but still He went out to many people

24:07.780 --> 24:10.860
and tried to save them.

24:11.730 --> 24:13.980
This was the right-side movement.

24:15.570 --> 24:21.690
That means Sahaja Yogis can also become right-sided,but like Christ.

24:22.610 --> 24:24.690
Otherwise if they are right-sided

24:24.980 --> 24:27.860
they’ll organise, they’ll do all kinds of things,

24:27.940 --> 24:29.820
and have problems of the right side.

24:30.650 --> 24:32.980
That’s why I want you to avoid the right side.

24:33.690 --> 24:38.940
But once you are fully a left-sided master of Sahaja Yoga,

24:39.820 --> 24:43.820
then it’s very, very much needed

24:44.030 --> 24:47.570
to be a complete personality of spirituality,

24:47.980 --> 24:50.860
that you should take to right-side movement.

24:51.190 --> 24:54.940
And what is the right-side movement is the collectivity.

24:56.150 --> 24:59.570
Should not be satisfied with what you have got.

25:00.230 --> 25:01.650
It’s very easy

25:01.860 --> 25:05.610
to feel, “Oh, now we have got realisation, now what is there?

25:05.980 --> 25:10.070
We are on top of the world!” That’s not so.

25:10.980 --> 25:14.940
You have to go out, talk to people.

25:15.570 --> 25:17.730
They will insult you, they’ll trouble you,

25:17.940 --> 25:19.650
they’ll do all kinds of things.

25:19.860 --> 25:24.570
But you are already a person, already a realised soul.

25:24.980 --> 25:27.190
You can listen to them, what they are saying;

25:27.820 --> 25:34.530
you will not ask for anything, but you’d like to do good to them.

25:35.110 --> 25:37.230
This is also a compassion,

25:37.940 --> 25:40.940
that you don’t want to keep your realisation to yourself,

25:41.230 --> 25:43.150
but you want to do it

25:43.610 --> 25:46.980
for others also so that they also get realisation,

25:47.230 --> 25:51.730
it’s very important. If you do not feel that way,

25:51.900 --> 25:54.730
the pity for people who haven’t got realisation,

25:55.150 --> 25:58.190
think of the times you were not realised.

25:59.940 --> 26:04.650
These people are also not realised and they are having a bad time,

26:04.860 --> 26:07.110
they can be in for any trouble.

26:08.110 --> 26:11.530
So now, it’s not that if you have got realisation

26:11.690 --> 26:14.190
you settle down with it – no, that’s not the way;

26:14.980 --> 26:17.820
but you should go all out to see

26:18.570 --> 26:21.940
that you give realisation to others, and save them.

26:22.900 --> 26:28.860
You all have got realisation not for your sake,

26:29.230 --> 26:33.900
it’s not limited for you, but it is meant for others,

26:35.110 --> 26:37.110
that you have to give it to others.

26:38.110 --> 26:41.730
And as soon as you’ll start giving it to others you’ll be amazed,

26:42.530 --> 26:46.570
so many qualities in you will come up;

26:49.650 --> 26:54.780
because when you see others, you find

26:55.940 --> 26:58.110
that what is lacking in them,

26:58.900 --> 27:02.980
what do they need, what you have to give,  how you have to give.

27:04.190 --> 27:06.690
You can become anything, you can become a poet,

27:06.860 --> 27:11.110
you can become a writer, you can, anything can you become,

27:11.650 --> 27:14.230
in case you face others.

27:15.110 --> 27:19.570
Then it comes as a reaction within you, all these qualities develop,

27:19.900 --> 27:26.650
and you become a very good, I should say, artist.

27:28.030 --> 27:32.110
This is only possible if you meet other people

27:32.690 --> 27:36.030
and talk to them about Sahaja Yoga,

27:36.780 --> 27:39.230
and tell them about your Self-realisation.

27:40.230 --> 27:43.820
I know there will be problems, I know. That is true.

27:44.110 --> 27:46.860
There will be people who will oppose you, say

27:47.650 --> 27:49.530
all kinds of things against you,

27:49.730 --> 27:52.860
and they’ll try to stop your activities and do

27:53.150 --> 27:55.570
all kinds of harm, doesn’t matter.

27:56.650 --> 27:58.780
But that’s the thing you should achieve,

27:59.070 --> 28:01.820
is to meet people, talk to them

28:02.070 --> 28:05.610
and start telling them about Self-realisation you have to save them.

28:06.860 --> 28:08.230
That’s important.

28:08.650 --> 28:12.190
But first of all you should know that you should have no right-sided

28:12.730 --> 28:16.530
complications, otherwise they’ll all run away.

28:16.860 --> 28:19.690
A person who is spiritual is supposed

28:19.900 --> 28:23.230
or accepted to be a very humble person.

28:23.980 --> 28:28.030
Of course because he is humble, people will take advantage of him,

28:28.150 --> 28:31.730
say all kinds of things, it’s alright, is a part of the game.

28:31.940 --> 28:35.650
But, he doesn’t mind, he doesn’t mind anything.

28:35.940 --> 28:38.230
Anything that comes his way, he doesn’t mind.

28:38.650 --> 28:44.070
But what is the main thing is that he has compassion.

28:44.820 --> 28:51.030
His compassion that he had before from the left side is now expanded

28:51.570 --> 28:53.860
and he wants to save the people.

28:54.690 --> 28:58.820
People don’t have food, is alright, it’s a big complication;

28:59.070 --> 29:01.610
if people are starving is another;

29:01.980 --> 29:05.900
but if they do not get spirituality,

29:07.230 --> 29:09.150
what’s the use of their human life,

29:09.530 --> 29:12.190
why did they evolve to this state?

29:12.940 --> 29:15.530
They are evolved from animal state,

29:16.570 --> 29:20.780
from the worst possible to a human state.

29:21.190 --> 29:24.230
And now if they do not get their realisation,

29:24.820 --> 29:28.030
that means this is worse than starving,

29:28.690 --> 29:31.030
worse than all kinds of poverty,

29:31.230 --> 29:34.780
worse than all kinds of diseases and troubles.

29:35.650 --> 29:41.570
So why not try to give them realisation?

29:42.610 --> 29:45.820
Why not see that you give them realisation?

29:46.150 --> 29:48.860
But first and foremost thing, as I said,

29:49.070 --> 29:51.900
that in the left you should be very strong.

29:52.820 --> 29:55.940
You shouldn’t start doing it because you have got your realisation,

29:56.230 --> 29:57.900
you can give realisation.

29:58.030 --> 30:00.610
So you should not start doing it

30:01.610 --> 30:05.650
unless and until you have strengthened your left side.

30:07.650 --> 30:10.230
Such a person is extremely humble,

30:10.940 --> 30:15.110
extremely straight, doesn’t grudge about anything,

30:15.650 --> 30:17.730
doesn’t grumble about anything,

30:17.980 --> 30:21.650
and can adjust itself into any circumstance.

30:22.230 --> 30:24.610
It is not attached to anything.

30:25.690 --> 30:28.650
It’s an automatic detachment, it doesn’t have to detach.

30:29.150 --> 30:31.730
You may do anything for that person,

30:31.900 --> 30:35.940
you may try to get anything for that person, it’s alright.

30:37.150 --> 30:39.780
That person will accept, no doubt,

30:40.110 --> 30:42.730
but without any attachment to anything.

30:43.190 --> 30:48.230
Such a detached person is the one who can work it out,

30:48.940 --> 30:51.690
all kinds of propagation of Sahaja Yoga.

30:52.610 --> 30:55.150
Today that is the greatest need of the world,

30:55.860 --> 30:58.650
that we have to have more Sahaja Yogis.

30:58.980 --> 31:02.190
Now, people are so shy to do that,

31:02.940 --> 31:04.650
it’s very surprising.

31:04.820 --> 31:07.690
But I have seen people who don’t have any truth,

31:08.110 --> 31:10.610
who have all kinds of bad gurus,

31:11.650 --> 31:17.900
get after others, try to spread their false ideas.

31:18.230 --> 31:20.530
But Sahaja Yogis, why should they feel,

31:20.690 --> 31:23.570
why should they feel shy, I don’t understand.

31:23.940 --> 31:29.570
So, talk about this to everyone, bring them to Sahaja Yoga.

31:30.030 --> 31:34.610
Is a very important day, because as a Guru puja,

31:34.980 --> 31:40.230
they say that a guru cannot give anything to you.

31:41.690 --> 31:43.980
But I can give you the advice,

31:44.690 --> 31:47.610
and the advice that you enlarge your heart,

31:48.190 --> 31:56.070
you become humble, and try to spread Sahaja Yoga

31:56.900 --> 32:00.230
with humility, not with aggressiveness.

32:00.650 --> 32:02.940
That is extremely important.

32:04.030 --> 32:08.070
If you can do that, then you’ll do full justice

32:09.780 --> 32:13.190
to this life,  which is a spiritual life.

32:14.230 --> 32:17.780
Without that you cannot achieve, you cannot achieve,

32:18.150 --> 32:20.650
the strength of spirituality.

32:21.900 --> 32:26.900
For that you haveto understand that it’s very, very important

32:27.780 --> 32:35.730
that you should give Sahaja Yoga a full chance,through your wisdom.

32:36.940 --> 32:39.230
What I receive [is] mostly the letters are

32:39.730 --> 32:43.230
that this person is troublesome, that person is troublesome,

32:43.730 --> 32:46.900
that person is doing like that. Forget it!

32:48.230 --> 32:52.030
All such persons are not important for Sahaja Yoga.

32:53.780 --> 32:57.650
But if you start on proper lines you will be amazed,

32:57.940 --> 33:02.610
you’ll meet so many people who want peace of mind,

33:02.860 --> 33:09.860
peace of heart and a complete oneness with the Divine.

33:10.900 --> 33:13.150
They may not accept, they may not say,

33:13.730 --> 33:16.980
they might have gone to the wrong people also, possibly.

33:18.070 --> 33:20.190
But despite everything,

33:20.650 --> 33:26.190
they would like to have a real spiritual peace within themselves.

33:27.110 --> 33:31.070
Is a very common desire nowadays among people,

33:32.070 --> 33:34.980
but to approach that and to reach that,

33:35.650 --> 33:39.940
you have to take to a life of a very simple personality.

33:42.230 --> 33:46.980
You see, if you are so much interested in money,

33:48.570 --> 33:53.530
or if you are so much interested in your so-called powers

33:53.940 --> 34:00.190
or in your ambitions, then Sahaja Yoga cannot do anything.

34:00.940 --> 34:03.690
But if you are interested in your compassion

34:04.150 --> 34:08.190
and understanding about today’s world,

34:08.570 --> 34:11.900
how it is in a turmoil: why?

34:12.110 --> 34:16.030
Because of the human beings being in the wrong.

34:17.070 --> 34:22.690
What we have to do is to pass them the knowledge of the Divine.

34:23.030 --> 34:25.030
That should be your desire,

34:25.610 --> 34:29.940
and that is what you’ll feel very much comfortable with.

34:32.190 --> 34:36.530
All other desires, all other wants are,

34:37.150 --> 34:39.650
as you say, it’s very transitory.

34:41.030 --> 34:45.030
One desire is to spread Sahaja Yoga,

34:45.570 --> 34:49.690
is so beautiful that you go on working on it,

34:49.900 --> 34:52.530
and every time you do that,

34:52.780 --> 34:55.190
you will be so joyous and happy,

34:56.070 --> 34:58.570
you’ll have no problems of any kind.

34:59.070 --> 35:02.980
That’s the sign of greatness of Sahaja Yoga,

35:03.690 --> 35:06.860
and I want you all to become like that.

35:07.900 --> 35:10.980
As today’s day is great, because

35:11.190 --> 35:16.030
we are thinking of all the great saints who came on this earth

35:16.690 --> 35:19.070
and who tried to lead us.  What they did,

35:19.230 --> 35:23.230
all of them tried to spread the truth all over the world.

35:24.150 --> 35:28.650
They suffered a lot, they had problems, so many problems,

35:29.070 --> 35:35.690
but they worked very hard in every way to spread Sahaja Yoga

35:35.940 --> 35:39.030
and talk about God anddivinity.

35:39.860 --> 35:43.190
All that is what today you have to give Me,

35:43.730 --> 35:48.230
a promise, that whenever you get any other human being,

35:48.820 --> 35:50.860
you can tell them about Sahaja Yoga.

35:54.030 --> 35:58.940
Not that it’s important but it’s absolutely

35:59.610 --> 36:01.940
immediate need of the world.

36:02.530 --> 36:05.030
If you understand this point,

36:05.230 --> 36:09.190
that at this time, why are you in this world

36:09.820 --> 36:11.980
and what is the need of the world,

36:12.230 --> 36:15.820
you will immediately start feeling the responsibility.

36:16.690 --> 36:19.690
Whether you are a man or a woman is not important.

36:20.110 --> 36:24.110
Go all out to preach, think,

36:25.150 --> 36:28.690
make people understand about Sahaja  Yoga

36:29.070 --> 36:31.110
in every way that is possible,

36:31.820 --> 36:35.230
and I think, then, you will become complete as gurus.

36:36.110 --> 36:39.780
If Sahaja Yoga is just with you, you cannot be a guru.

36:40.230 --> 36:43.570
‘Guru’ also doesn’t mean that you go on preaching about Sahaja Yoga

36:43.730 --> 36:47.150
talking about Sahaja Yoga, giving lectures about Sahaja Yoga, no!

36:47.980 --> 36:52.190
It means the one who gives realisations to others.

36:54.230 --> 36:59.650
How many people you give realisation is the thing,

36:59.780 --> 37:04.190
not to be counted,  but to be felt within like the ripples,

37:05.150 --> 37:09.230
waves of the Ocean of Love in your heart.

37:10.070 --> 37:15.190
So beautiful it is to see that people get realisation

37:15.780 --> 37:19.860
and are immersed in the joy of spirituality.

37:21.030 --> 37:26.110
That’s what I want you to do. That’s why I am on this earth.

37:26.690 --> 37:29.820
I had to suffer also quite a lot, doesn’t matter:

37:29.980 --> 37:33.070
so-called sufferings, I was watching it just like a drama.

37:33.860 --> 37:35.230
So it’s ok.

37:36.570 --> 37:38.690
As long as you do not pay much attention

37:38.820 --> 37:41.150
to all these sufferings, what is so great?

37:41.940 --> 37:48.570
Now you have seen yesterday a beautiful drama about Mohammad Sahib.

37:49.230 --> 37:54.070
I always used to think,  and it was such pain, about Him,  that

37:54.230 --> 37:58.110
how people have misunderstood and have gone astray:

37:58.860 --> 38:01.650
why they are doing all wrong things? Now,

38:02.230 --> 38:06.900
I feel happy that at least you people have realised His greatness,

38:07.190 --> 38:10.940
and have understood and made such a beautiful drama out of it.

38:11.780 --> 38:15.230
I don’t know how far we can propagate this,

38:15.690 --> 38:19.940
but it’s a fact that Mohammad Sahib Himself

38:22.030 --> 38:29.980
was finished, then also His daughter, grand-children were finished,

38:31.690 --> 38:33.610
His son-in-law was finished.

38:34.860 --> 38:36.820
And after that, by finishing them,

38:36.980 --> 38:40.900
they started another horrible thing called Sunnis.

38:41.860 --> 38:46.650
Now, the Sunnah religion is not near the truth at all,

38:46.860 --> 38:52.730
it’s some sort of a very aggressive and a very cruel religion,

38:53.860 --> 38:56.690
and that started spreading everywhere.

38:57.690 --> 39:02.900
In the real Islam religion of Mohammed Sahib was not there.

39:04.110 --> 39:08.030
Those people who killed Him started becoming ‘Islamic’.

39:10.820 --> 39:14.150
So this is also a very wrong thing,

39:14.570 --> 39:20.070
that a man who was so great and so much of spirituality

39:21.030 --> 39:23.150
was not just accepted,

39:23.780 --> 39:26.980
and somebody who killed Him is now accepted.

39:27.940 --> 39:29.940
It can happen in anything.

39:30.230 --> 39:33.190
But the worst it has happened in is Islamic world,

39:33.690 --> 39:38.030
which is very dangerous, and that’s we see

39:38.230 --> 39:41.690
that, in the name of God, how many bad things they are doing.

39:45.650 --> 39:48.190
So, try to understand

39:48.860 --> 39:54.230
that it is not the fate of Mohammad Sahib it has happened,

39:55.150 --> 39:58.190
it’s not the fate of reality it has happened,

39:58.900 --> 40:02.150
but it’s an eye-opener for all of us to see

40:02.860 --> 40:09.860
that the Truth is always challenged by untruth.

40:10.900 --> 40:14.030
And we should stand by the Truth, whatever may happen.

40:15.570 --> 40:18.650
And a day will come when people will realise

40:18.860 --> 40:21.570
that this was a wrong thing they were being,

40:22.030 --> 40:23.940
all the time been following,

40:24.730 --> 40:28.150
and have been doing all kinds of nonsensical things.

40:28.980 --> 40:33.650
All this will work out I am sure, very soon,

40:35.190 --> 40:39.820
if My desire is that powerful, I’m sure

40:40.070 --> 40:45.190
that they will realise that to be kind to be nice to be compassionate

40:46.110 --> 40:51.610
is the best way to feel happy, nothing more than that.

40:52.610 --> 40:55.570
May God bless you.
