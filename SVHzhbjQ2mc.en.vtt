05:11.714 --> 05:22.788
Today we have such a great opportunity
to celebrate the birth of Christ.

05:29.378 --> 05:34.724
He was born in a manger.

05:34.978 --> 05:40.475
All these things are already pre-planned.

05:43.964 --> 05:51.503
That He should be born in a manger
in difficult situations,

05:52.528 --> 05:56.911
to show that whether you are born
poor or rich,

05:57.112 --> 06:04.285
whether you are born in difficulties
or in problems,

06:04.486 --> 06:09.927
if you have Divinity within you it shines
by itself.

06:14.164 --> 06:25.977
As the Christianity took a very wrong
deviated line,

06:27.128 --> 06:33.198
they have never been able to understand
the significance of Christ.

06:33.405 --> 06:43.373
To them Immaculate Conception is absolutely
not possible.

06:43.574 --> 06:48.977
Most of the people think that it's some
sort of a mythical story.

06:50.686 --> 06:55.189
But in India we do believe

06:55.390 --> 07:10.269
that Gauri created Shri Ganesha out
of Her own vibrations

07:10.470 --> 07:16.274
and that He became the Deity of Mooladhara.

07:16.475 --> 07:21.125
We accept it. But not in the West.

07:21.326 --> 07:23.289
They will never accept such a thing

07:23.490 --> 07:30.649
because their mental side is over-developed
and dominates them.

07:32.585 --> 07:39.067
Maybe they are not so very old like Indians

07:39.268 --> 07:43.948
to understand that above all is God.

07:44.149 --> 07:48.865
Even the concept of God is quite mental.

07:49.825 --> 07:53.758
Moreover, the way Christianity has been,

07:53.959 --> 07:59.941
it has not provided any proper guidance.

08:00.142 --> 08:06.154
On the contrary, whenever they have failed
they said: "It's a mystery."

08:07.838 --> 08:12.779
But it's very simple to understand
for Indians,

08:12.980 --> 08:16.549
that anything is possible for God.

08:16.750 --> 08:21.663
After all He is God. He is God Almighty.

08:21.864 --> 08:29.582
Because of this mental attitude which
is much lower

08:29.783 --> 08:34.394
than the knowledge of your Spirit,

08:34.595 --> 08:38.901
the ordinary, mundane type of this
superficial knowledge

08:39.102 --> 08:48.247
can never allow the personality to accept
the greatness of God.

08:50.653 --> 08:54.846
I had a grandma. She was My father's aunt

08:55.047 --> 09:02.755
and she used to tell us a nice story about
somebody who was going to meet God.

09:02.956 --> 09:06.390
Of course this - in India everybody
understands all these things.

09:06.591 --> 09:09.591
They will not say: "How is he going to meet
God?" but they accept, you see:

09:09.792 --> 09:11.172
“All right, he is going to meet God”.

09:11.373 --> 09:16.385
So when he was going on the way,
on the road, he found one gentleman

09:16.586 --> 09:22.671
sitting there, nicely singing songs,
bhajans of God,

09:22.872 --> 09:26.525
doing nothing on the roadside.

09:26.726 --> 09:29.637
So he said: "Oh, so you are going
to meet God?"

09:29.837 --> 09:34.796
"Yes, I am going to meet Him. So have
you any message for Him?"

09:34.997 --> 09:38.767
"Yes, please tell Him that I'm all right,

09:38.968 --> 09:45.476
but He should arrange for my food, because
I think the food is now finishing."

09:45.677 --> 09:49.173
He said: "Really, that's what you want
me to tell Him?"

09:49.374 --> 09:57.566
"Yes, yes, please tell Him. Oh, of course
He'll arrange, but please tell Him."

09:57.767 --> 10:01.466
So he went ahead and he met another
gentleman

10:01.667 --> 10:04.757
who was standing on his head, or
in a Christian way I would say

10:04.958 --> 10:09.742
he was going to church every day with nice
suits, and singing hymns every day,

10:09.943 --> 10:13.087
listening to the pastor's sermons, or
whatever you may say;

10:13.288 --> 10:16.860
and in the Indian way we can say he was
going to the temple every day,

10:17.061 --> 10:21.742
standing on his head, doing all kinds
of yoga asanas and everything.

10:21.943 --> 10:26.779
And he asked him: "Please go and ask
God - I've tried everything.

10:26.980 --> 10:29.489
When is He going to meet me? I would
like to see Him.

10:29.690 --> 10:32.286
I would like to have His darshan."
He said: "All right."

10:32.487 --> 10:38.099
So he went to God,

10:38.300 --> 10:43.637
and whatever work he had he finished
with it,

10:43.838 --> 10:48.541
and then God asked him: "Have you got
anything to tell Me?"

10:48.742 --> 10:55.713
He said: "Nothing much, but I met one
gentleman while coming

10:55.914 --> 10:59.749
and he said that 'I'm doing all kinds
of things, I have tried everything,

10:59.964 --> 11:02.672
and when will God meet me? I am standing
on my head,

11:02.873 --> 11:07.057
and I am doing also all kinds of yoga
asanas, and all kinds of things,

11:07.258 --> 11:10.596
and also I am going to church and
mosque, I am praying,

11:10.797 --> 11:16.517
doing all sorts of prayers, but when will
God meet me?'"

11:16.718 --> 11:20.492
So God said: "Tell him he has to do little
more.

11:20.693 --> 11:25.717
See, it's not easy. When Sahaja Yoga
will come we'll see!"

11:36.832 --> 11:40.924
So then even he said: "And there’s another
one who was on the road, You see.

11:41.125 --> 11:44.122
He was just enjoying himself singing songs,

11:44.323 --> 11:46.270
he suddenly saw me, and he told me:

11:46.470 --> 11:49.448
'You see, my food is now finishing, ask
God to arrange it for me.'"

11:49.649 --> 11:53.662
He said: "Really, is the food just
finishing?" Immediately God said:

11:53.863 --> 11:57.209
"What are you doing, why don't you go
and look after him? His food is finishing."

11:57.410 --> 12:00.528
"No, no, Sir, we yesterday only, we
arranged it, all that."

12:00.729 --> 12:03.808
He said: "All right, all right, doesn't
matter." You see, he couldn't understand,

12:04.009 --> 12:06.005
you know, that this fellow who is trying
all these things

12:06.206 --> 12:09.222
and God is still saying that he has
to wait.

12:09.423 --> 12:12.879
And while this fellow is just singing songs
of God and all that,

12:13.080 --> 12:17.194
and why is it so much impressed by this
another fellow

12:17.395 --> 12:22.632
who is doing nothing to seek God?

12:23.045 --> 12:26.074
So then God realized that he is in some
sort of an illusion.

12:26.275 --> 12:30.973
So He told him: "All right, you go and tell
them one thing.

12:31.174 --> 12:36.655
To both of them the same thing, that 'When
I went to God what I saw there

12:36.856 --> 12:45.123
was that He made a camel pass through
the eye of a needle.'"

12:46.823 --> 12:50.009
So he said: "Really, I should tell them?"

12:50.210 --> 12:53.292
"Yes, yes, you just tell them, and see
the reaction."

12:53.493 --> 12:57.662
So he went down. So this is, the first one
met him, he said: "What God has said?"

12:57.863 --> 13:01.570
He said that God has said: "Wait till
Sahaja Yoga comes in, then I'll meet you.

13:01.771 --> 13:04.192
Before that you go round like this."

13:04.393 --> 13:06.442
"Oh God, when will this Sahaja Yoga come?"

13:06.672 --> 13:09.036
And he said: "So, but He'll meet me
sometime?

13:09.237 --> 13:13.859
I hope Sahaja Yoga also comes some time."

13:14.160 --> 13:16.809
And he was quite disappointed.

13:17.010 --> 13:21.541
So he went and he asked him that:
"What did you see with,

13:21.742 --> 13:25.099
there when you went to see God?"
He said: "I saw that, you know,

13:25.300 --> 13:29.299
He passed a camel through the eye
of an, of a needle."

13:29.513 --> 13:33.334
He said: "What? How is it possible?
It's impossible!" -

13:33.565 --> 13:36.285
Now mental - "How is it possible,

13:36.486 --> 13:39.451
that a camel can pass through the eye,
it's not possible,

13:39.652 --> 13:44.906
see the volume of this one and such
a little thing. How can he pass?

13:45.107 --> 13:47.906
No, no, no, no you are just telling me
a story because you have been to God,

13:48.107 --> 13:52.134
you are trying to show off, that's all. I,
I don't believe in all this nonsense.

13:52.335 --> 13:55.831
You see, you are just telling me lies,
and don't try to befool me."

13:56.032 --> 14:00.645
So he went to another person who was
on the street eating nicely.

14:00.846 --> 14:03.629
He said: "How are you?" "Oh, I know He had
arranged before you reached there,

14:03.830 --> 14:08.025
I know it was all right after all. You see,
He looks after me all the time.

14:08.226 --> 14:13.729
So what did you see when you went there?"
He said: "I saw that God Almighty

14:13.930 --> 14:20.717
passed a camel through an eye of a
needle. It's a very amazing thing."

14:20.918 --> 14:26.123
He said: "What amazing thing? He is God,
do you know He is God?

14:26.324 --> 14:33.208
Do you know He is God? God can do
anything. He can do anything!"

14:33.409 --> 14:41.768
That's made him understand, that if you
understand that God is all-powerful -

14:41.969 --> 14:46.162
all-powerful, it doesn't mean that He can
move Himalayas to Maharashtra.

14:46.363 --> 14:49.480
It doesn't mean that!

14:58.856 --> 15:02.482
But it means He is all powerful.

15:02.683 --> 15:06.583
Means He can do subtlest and subtlest
thing, and such things

15:06.784 --> 15:11.946
which our brain, this mental side cannot
understand.

15:12.147 --> 15:18.034
It's beyond the conception of a human mind.

15:19.973 --> 15:23.420
This is what God is.

15:23.621 --> 15:26.266
He is the One who has created human beings.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.490
He has to be beyond us if He is creating.

15:28.698 --> 15:31.946
If a potter creates a pot that means
he is beyond the pot.

15:32.147 --> 15:35.677
Pot cannot create God... the potter.

15:35.878 --> 15:41.373
And the potter has created the pot,
so that means that this pot

15:41.574 --> 15:46.513
which is created by him has to be -
something which is made by him,

15:46.714 --> 15:52.077
so he has to be much more powerful
than the pot is.

15:53.570 --> 16:01.197
But it is unbelievable, or say, beyond
the conception of human beings,

16:01.398 --> 16:11.144
that what a God it must be Who has made
this great computer.

16:12.461 --> 16:15.715
We take everything for granted.

16:15.916 --> 16:21.830
We cannot even make a particle of clay
ourself.

16:22.679 --> 16:25.550
We cannot make anything, human beings
cannot make.

16:25.751 --> 16:28.774
Ha, if there is some stone, all right, you
can put this up.

16:28.975 --> 16:33.748
If there is some clay, you can make some
sort of a house out of it.

16:33.949 --> 16:37.339
But it’s all dead from the dead.

16:40.156 --> 16:51.632
But can you make a candle which will
burn badhas?

16:55.858 --> 17:03.102
You have seen it with your own eyes that
before My photograph the badhas burn.

17:03.303 --> 17:06.369
Can you do that?

17:08.940 --> 17:15.522
Now you, we have no, also the idea
of the complete, intricate working,

17:15.723 --> 17:27.015
delicate machinery, and also very dynamic
explosive machinery,

17:27.216 --> 17:32.690
how it works to create human beings,
to create all this universe,

17:32.891 --> 17:40.022
to create all these beautiful flowers and
trees and everything.

17:40.223 --> 17:44.991
Look at the stars. Look at how many
they are.

17:45.192 --> 17:50.169
Out of that He has chosen this Mother Earth
to create human beings.

17:50.370 --> 17:53.785
How He has made it?

17:55.947 --> 18:04.956
When He wants to send His own Son, He
can send it the way He wants to send it.

18:06.526 --> 18:18.591
Even to challenge this shows the mental
mind which is in, absolutely in mud.

18:22.325 --> 18:27.383
So to accept it is only possible

18:27.584 --> 18:31.541
when you have saints, real saints who
tell you,

18:31.742 --> 18:38.237
that this is how Shri Ganesha was born
out of Gauri.

18:42.526 --> 18:46.737
But to jump into it, into faith,

18:46.938 --> 18:53.061
when you come to Sahaja Yoga, you start
seeing miracles taking place.

18:54.111 --> 18:58.439
Then you can understand that these miracles
are taking place

18:58.640 --> 19:04.724
and if there is another miracle that has to
take place it will take place in any case.

19:04.925 --> 19:09.397
We are not doing anything, it’s all done.

19:10.324 --> 19:16.567
And we don't doubt it. Once you doubt
you become again the same

19:18.659 --> 19:24.056
human being which is just embedded
in the mud.

19:25.780 --> 19:30.329
I always say that you are like lotuses now
opened out.

19:30.530 --> 19:34.234
You are not flying in the air. Your roots
are down there.

19:34.435 --> 19:39.745
But you are now lotuses,

19:39.946 --> 19:47.156
and that's what is on top of the lotus,
this Mahalakshmi principle is born.

19:47.357 --> 19:53.863
Mahalakshmi principle is the One which
came on this earth

19:54.064 --> 20:05.162
as Sitaji, as Radha and also as Mary,
as Mother Mary.

20:05.480 --> 20:11.317
It's said that Mahalakshmi is born out
of the sea.

20:11.518 --> 20:18.289
What is the meaning of "Mary"? Maria means,
you know, Marine means "the sea".

20:20.034 --> 20:22.738
She was born out of the sea.

20:22.939 --> 20:29.602
So She being a Mahalakshmi Herself, She
could create a child. What's the harm?

20:32.165 --> 20:35.596
She could do anything,

20:38.076 --> 20:41.511
and this is the thing you have to rise
above.

20:41.712 --> 20:45.648
Christians have to rise above this
Christianity,

20:45.849 --> 20:49.842
and has to understand that it's such
a great thing that was Christ

20:50.043 --> 20:56.560
Who came on this earth, Who was the
Incarnation of the principle of Ganesha.

20:56.761 --> 20:59.685
Ganesha becoming Mahavishnu is
a very big thing

20:59.886 --> 21:02.962
which one should try to understand.

21:03.163 --> 21:10.039
Ganesha is the Son of Shiva.

21:10.896 --> 21:22.869
Shri Ganesha is the One Who was first
created before creating anything,

21:24.075 --> 21:30.930
any atmosphere, anything, because He is
the Omkara,

21:31.131 --> 21:37.163
and the Omkara is the first breaking
of Adi Shakti from Shiva.

21:37.364 --> 21:42.272
That sound, "Tan-kar", as they call it.
From there started Omkara

21:42.473 --> 21:47.525
and He is the One Who is the embodiment
of that Omkara.

21:47.726 --> 21:51.558
So this sound is Shri Ganesh, is His power,

21:51.759 --> 22:00.063
was created first foremost thing, just
to create holiness, pavitrata.

22:00.264 --> 22:04.509
When this holiness was created, this
pavitrata was created,

22:04.710 --> 22:11.573
then everything was created in the sea
of that holiness.

22:13.097 --> 22:20.892
And then He incarnated as Christ, but
as Mahavishnu,

22:21.093 --> 22:26.591
not as Shiva's Son, but as Mahavishnu.

22:26.792 --> 22:34.511
And who is Vishnu? He is an uncle
of Shri Ganesh.

22:35.336 --> 22:42.471
His Mother's brother is Shri Vishnu.

22:43.606 --> 22:49.366
So the, it was brought up, we should say,
by Mahavishnu, we can say,

22:49.567 --> 22:56.213
but Mahalakshmi adopted the principle
of Shri Ganesh.

22:56.414 --> 22:59.514
In the Kundalini chart you can see that
the Shri Ganesha

22:59.715 --> 23:04.620
is connected on the left-hand side
to the Ida Nadi,

23:08.141 --> 23:12.068
and the Kundalini is above that.

23:12.269 --> 23:19.333
So now what has happened is this, that
He transcended that part,

23:19.534 --> 23:22.234
and if He had to come for the redemption,

23:22.435 --> 23:27.501
He had to come as the Son of Mahalakshmi.

23:27.702 --> 23:31.086
So it was Mahalakshmi who adopted Him,

23:31.287 --> 23:38.953
or we should say, really conceived Him
within Himself as Christ,

23:42.226 --> 23:44.765
and He became Mahavishnu.

23:44.966 --> 23:53.484
Anything is possible in the family of Gods
and Goddesses, because they are Gods.

23:55.497 --> 24:01.033
It is beyond human mind to understand
how these things

24:01.234 --> 24:07.867
are working out in that realm. Very
difficult.

24:08.422 --> 24:12.110
But now you have got Realization, you can
feel in the cool breeze,

24:12.311 --> 24:16.683
so many new things are happening to you.
So now believe Me,

24:16.884 --> 24:21.856
that there is no unholy alliances

24:22.057 --> 24:25.002
among the Gods and Goddesses, no
unholy alliances.

24:25.203 --> 24:29.963
There is nothing that is human in them.

24:30.164 --> 24:36.421
They are all divine, pure people.

24:38.532 --> 24:41.839
Once you understand this point, then
you will understand

24:42.040 --> 24:52.178
why Shri Ganesha had to accept to be
a Son of Mahalakshmi,

24:52.379 --> 24:56.718
was born to Him as Christ.

24:56.919 --> 25:04.478
Because He had to come on Agnya,
and for the redemption,

25:04.679 --> 25:10.256
as Ganesha, He doesn't do the redemption
part,

25:10.457 --> 25:18.721
because at that stage He is for
the innocence, for the holiness,

25:18.922 --> 25:26.060
for the wisdom or also for destroying
a negativity.

25:26.269 --> 25:32.042
But He had to come up; only He,

25:32.243 --> 25:42.429
only Ganesha could be brought to this
very constricted chakra, Agnya chakra.

25:43.318 --> 25:46.366
Now why is it constricted? It's quite
a scientific thing

25:46.567 --> 25:49.218
which I would not like to discuss today.

25:49.419 --> 25:51.891
But it had to be constricted

25:52.092 --> 25:55.419
and it goes on getting more constricted,
this Agnya chakra,

25:55.620 --> 26:02.935
the more, the more we think, the more
we go into the left or right,

26:03.136 --> 26:07.685
it goes on really becoming like this,
absolutely like this.

26:07.886 --> 26:15.763
So in this very subtle area only Christ
could be settled,

26:15.964 --> 26:20.102
because He is the subtlest of subtle.

26:21.791 --> 26:26.671
He's even subtler than an atom, because
in the atom

26:26.872 --> 26:31.454
those vibrations which move asymmetric
and symmetric movements

26:31.655 --> 26:36.538
are subtler than the atom.

26:36.739 --> 26:39.955
And this is the subtler of that also.

26:40.156 --> 26:45.206
So in that little very constricted area,

26:45.407 --> 26:55.026
only a personality like Christ, which is
nothing but purity.

26:55.227 --> 27:07.700
There is no other element in Him
but purity.

27:08.248 --> 27:16.918
All other Incarnations have all the five
elements in it.

27:17.119 --> 27:23.716
He has nothing. He is nothing but pure
vibrations.

27:23.917 --> 27:27.642
That's why He could walk on the water,

27:27.843 --> 27:35.845
because there was no mass in His body,
no matter in His body. No matter.

27:36.046 --> 27:41.371
No element, except for Chaitanya itself.

27:41.602 --> 27:46.963
Omkara becoming Ganesha in the mud,

27:47.164 --> 27:52.602
or the what you can say, the thing that
came out of Her body.

27:52.803 --> 27:57.400
Only the Chaitanya. So at Ganesha's stage
we can say

27:57.601 --> 28:02.291
that the Chaitanya was kept in that form,

28:02.492 --> 28:09.154
but in the state of Christ it was no
longer there.

28:12.402 --> 28:18.011
But the whole drama was played later on,
of His death and resurrection,

28:18.212 --> 28:22.262
because He is the One who is responsible
for our resurrection,

28:22.463 --> 28:27.802
because He is the Gate. He is the Path
because He is Shri Ganesh.

28:28.003 --> 28:34.205
Omkara is the Path, and He is the Gate,
but He is not the destination.

28:37.271 --> 28:40.862
His Mother is the destination.

28:43.172 --> 28:47.773
Even Mahalakshmi is not the Destination.
Even Mahakali, Mahasaraswati.

28:47.974 --> 28:53.463
It's the Adi Shakti is the destination
where you have to reach.

28:54.820 --> 28:58.603
All these things were never told
in the Bible

28:58.804 --> 29:04.379
because He could hardly live for four
years with public life.

29:04.580 --> 29:09.177
Nor did they want to tell about it because
they did not know.

29:09.378 --> 29:16.008
Also there was a definite suppression
of all Divine things,

29:16.209 --> 29:20.848
for these people are all commercialized
institutions,

29:21.049 --> 29:24.996
as we have also in India all kinds
of commercial institutions.

29:25.197 --> 29:30.628
But the only advantage in India is that
religion is not organized.

29:30.829 --> 29:33.447
Thank God for that!

29:33.648 --> 29:36.032
But they organized it, they organized
Christ,

29:36.233 --> 29:38.990
they organized all His principles,
everything,

29:39.191 --> 29:42.674
and now they think He was a good human
being.

29:42.875 --> 29:46.027
What a certificate to give!

29:48.268 --> 29:53.636
So today we are here to celebrate
the birth of Omkara.

29:53.837 --> 29:58.933
It's a very big thing. I don't know
if you can realize it, what it is,

29:59.134 --> 30:06.551
which moves into everything, whether it is
anu, paramanu, is the atom, molecules,

30:06.752 --> 30:14.022
into all the organizing of chemicals and
also the periodic laws,

30:14.223 --> 30:23.380
and also in the gravity, into everything
that moves is this Omkara,

30:23.581 --> 30:28.690
and your vibrations are nothing but
Omkaras.

30:29.825 --> 30:34.067
Actually, in My photograph the vibrations
have come as Omkaras.

30:34.268 --> 30:38.749
On the head of the people there is Omkara
written.

30:39.321 --> 30:44.239
How is it happening, these lights look
like Omkara?

30:44.440 --> 30:47.797
How is it on top of the heads of the Sahaja
Yogis,

30:47.998 --> 30:51.816
there's - all the Sahaja Yogis' heads -
there is Omkara?

30:52.017 --> 31:00.899
Or Allah in Arabic language, My name
also, in Arabic?

31:02.666 --> 31:06.007
Who is doing this?

31:08.788 --> 31:12.599
It is He who is doing all those things.

31:12.800 --> 31:22.105
So Omkara itself takes a form to do things
to convince you of Adi Shakti.

31:22.306 --> 31:29.803
He is the One who is handling all these
powers.

31:31.616 --> 31:36.611
He doesn't enter into the photograph,
no, He does not,

31:36.812 --> 31:40.473
but He plays a trick.

31:43.131 --> 31:46.717
After all you see, if you go into details,
how do you get a photograph?

31:46.918 --> 31:52.292
Through the light. The light passes
straight, in a straight line.

31:52.493 --> 31:57.032
But if He wants, He can make the light
pass another way round.

31:57.233 --> 32:00.792
He can just transform the light into
something else.

32:00.993 --> 32:04.083
He can do whatever He likes.

32:04.284 --> 32:08.460
And that's what He does to convince you.

32:08.661 --> 32:11.869
And He said that "Anything against Me
I'll tolerate,

32:12.070 --> 32:15.630
but nothing against the Holy Ghost."

32:15.831 --> 32:20.189
And this Holy Ghost is the Adi Shakti.

32:21.728 --> 32:28.974
Without Him you cannot go to the Sahasrara.

32:29.175 --> 32:32.422
So the in the whole play He is like
the sutra dhara,

32:32.623 --> 32:36.420
He is the One who is the conductor,

32:36.621 --> 32:43.188
the One moves the strings in a puppet show.

32:43.389 --> 32:46.250
And so it is very important to pray
to Shri Ganesha,

32:46.451 --> 32:49.307
every time we have Puja, we have
to pray to Him

32:49.508 --> 32:56.005
and we, that's how we are praying to Lord
Jesus Christ. Every time.

32:56.206 --> 33:01.569
Without His auspiciousness, without His
help, we cannot do Sahaja Yoga.

33:01.770 --> 33:08.328
He is the Manager. See, I am sitting
here and He is the manager.

33:08.529 --> 33:12.460
Supposing there is no management, how
will I speak here?

33:12.661 --> 33:15.889
Nothing can happen. But He is so efficient,

33:16.090 --> 33:21.827
and you never see Him working out
everything, doing everything.

33:22.159 --> 33:26.180
(Hindi talk)
