00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:22.756
Today we have such a great opportunity to celebrate the birth of Christ.

00:05:29.346 --> 00:05:34.696
He was born in a manger.

00:05:34.946 --> 00:05:40.446
All these things are already pre-planned.

00:05:43.936 --> 00:05:51.476
That He should be born in a manger in difficult situations,

00:05:52.496 --> 00:05:56.886
to show that whether you are born poor or rich,

00:05:57.086 --> 00:06:04.256
whether you are born in difficulties or in problems,

00:06:04.456 --> 00:06:09.896
if you have Divinity within you it shines by itself.

00:06:14.136 --> 00:06:25.946
As the Christianity took a very wrong deviated line,

00:06:27.096 --> 00:06:33.166
they have never been able to understand the significance of Christ.

00:06:33.376 --> 00:06:43.346
To them Immaculate Conception is absolutely not possible.

00:06:43.546 --> 00:06:48.946
Most of the people think that it's some sort of a mythical story.

00:06:50.656 --> 00:06:55.156
But in India we do believe

00:06:55.366 --> 00:07:10.236
that Gauri created Shri Ganesha out of Her own vibrations

00:07:10.446 --> 00:07:16.246
and that He became the Deity of Mooladhara.

00:07:16.446 --> 00:07:21.096
We accept it. But not in the West.

00:07:21.296 --> 00:07:23.256
They will never accept such a thing

00:07:23.466 --> 00:07:30.616
because their mental side is over-developed and dominates them.

00:07:32.556 --> 00:07:39.036
Maybe they are not so very old like Indians

00:07:39.236 --> 00:07:43.916
to understand that above all is God.

00:07:44.116 --> 00:07:48.836
Even the concept of God is quite mental.

00:07:49.796 --> 00:07:53.726
Moreover, the way Christianity has been,

00:07:53.926 --> 00:07:59.916
it has not provided any proper guidance.

00:08:00.116 --> 00:08:06.126
On the contrary, whenever they have failed they said: "It's a mystery."

00:08:07.806 --> 00:08:12.746
But it's very simple to understand for Indians,

00:08:12.956 --> 00:08:16.516
that anything is possible for God.

00:08:16.726 --> 00:08:21.636
After all He is God. He is God Almighty.

00:08:21.836 --> 00:08:29.556
Because of this mental attitude which is much lower

00:08:29.756 --> 00:08:34.366
than the knowledge of your Spirit,

00:08:34.566 --> 00:08:38.876
the ordinary, mundane type of this superficial knowledge

00:08:39.076 --> 00:08:48.216
can never allow the personality to accept the greatness of God.

00:08:50.626 --> 00:08:54.816
I had a grandma. She was My father's aunt

00:08:55.016 --> 00:09:02.726
and she used to tell us a nice story about somebody who was going to meet God.

00:09:02.926 --> 00:09:06.366
Of course this - in India everybody understands all these things.

00:09:06.566 --> 00:09:09.566
They will not say: "How is he going to meet God?" but they accept, you see:

00:09:09.766 --> 00:09:11.146
“All right, he is going to meet God”.

00:09:11.346 --> 00:09:16.356
So when he was going on the way, on the road, he found one gentleman

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:22.646
sitting there, nicely singing songs, bhajans of God,

00:09:22.846 --> 00:09:26.496
doing nothing on the roadside.

00:09:26.696 --> 00:09:29.606
So he said: "Oh, so you are going to meet God?"

00:09:29.806 --> 00:09:34.766
"Yes, I am going to meet Him. So have you any message for Him?"

00:09:34.966 --> 00:09:38.736
"Yes, please tell Him that I'm all right,

00:09:38.936 --> 00:09:45.446
but He should arrange for my food, because I think the food is now finishing."

00:09:45.646 --> 00:09:49.146
He said: "Really, that's what you want me to tell Him?"

00:09:49.346 --> 00:09:57.536
"Yes, yes, please tell Him. Oh, of course He'll arrange, but please tell Him."

00:09:57.736 --> 00:10:01.436
So he went ahead and he met another gentleman

00:10:01.636 --> 00:10:04.726
who was standing on his head, or in a Christian way I would say

00:10:04.926 --> 00:10:09.716
he was going to church every day with nice suits, and singing hymns every day,

00:10:09.916 --> 00:10:13.056
listening to the pastor's sermons, or whatever you may say;

00:10:13.256 --> 00:10:16.836
and in the Indian way we can say he was going to the temple every day,

00:10:17.036 --> 00:10:21.716
standing on his head, doing all kinds of yoga asanas and everything.

00:10:21.916 --> 00:10:26.746
And he asked him: "Please go and ask God - I've tried everything.

00:10:26.956 --> 00:10:29.456
When is He going to meet me? I would like to see Him.

00:10:29.666 --> 00:10:32.256
I would like to have His darshan." He said: "All right."

00:10:32.456 --> 00:10:38.066
So he went to God,

00:10:38.276 --> 00:10:43.606
and whatever work he had he finished with it,

00:10:43.806 --> 00:10:48.516
and then God asked him: "Have you got anything to tell Me?"

00:10:48.716 --> 00:10:55.686
He said: "Nothing much, but I met one gentleman while coming

00:10:55.886 --> 00:10:59.716
and he said that 'I'm doing all kinds of things, I have tried everything,

00:10:59.936 --> 00:11:02.646
and when will God meet me? I am standing on my head,

00:11:02.846 --> 00:11:07.026
and I am doing also all kinds of yoga asanas, and all kinds of things,

00:11:07.226 --> 00:11:10.566
and also I am going to church and mosque, I am praying,

00:11:10.766 --> 00:11:16.486
doing all sorts of prayers, but when will God meet me?'"

00:11:16.686 --> 00:11:20.466
So God said: "Tell him he has to do little more.

00:11:20.666 --> 00:11:25.686
See, it's not easy. When Sahaja Yoga will come we'll see!"

00:11:36.806 --> 00:11:40.896
So then even he said: "And there’s another one who was on the road, You see.

00:11:41.096 --> 00:11:44.096
He was just enjoying himself singing songs,

00:11:44.296 --> 00:11:46.246
he suddenly saw me, and he told me:

00:11:46.446 --> 00:11:49.416
'You see, my food is now finishing, ask God to arrange it for me.'"

00:11:49.616 --> 00:11:53.636
He said: "Really, is the food just finishing?" Immediately God said:

00:11:53.836 --> 00:11:57.176
"What are you doing, why don't you go and look after him? His food is finishing."

00:11:57.386 --> 00:12:00.496
"No, no, Sir, we yesterday only, we arranged it, all that."

00:12:00.696 --> 00:12:03.776
He said: "All right, all right, doesn't matter." You see, he couldn't understand,

00:12:03.976 --> 00:12:05.976
you know, that this fellow who is trying all these things

00:12:06.176 --> 00:12:09.196
and God is still saying that he has to wait.

00:12:09.396 --> 00:12:12.846
And while this fellow is just singing songs of God and all that,

00:12:13.056 --> 00:12:17.166
and why is it so much impressed by this another fellow

00:12:17.366 --> 00:12:22.606
who is doing nothing to seek God?

00:12:23.016 --> 00:12:26.046
So then God realized that he is in some sort of an illusion.

00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:30.946
So He told him: "All right, you go and tell them one thing.

00:12:31.146 --> 00:12:36.626
To both of them the same thing, that 'When I went to God what I saw there

00:12:36.826 --> 00:12:45.096
was that He made a camel pass through the eye of a needle.'"

00:12:46.796 --> 00:12:49.976
So he said: "Really, I should tell them?"

00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:53.266
"Yes, yes, you just tell them, and see the reaction."

00:12:53.466 --> 00:12:57.636
So he went down. So this is, the first one met him, he said: "What God has said?"

00:12:57.836 --> 00:13:01.546
He said that God has said: "Wait till Sahaja Yoga comes in, then I'll meet you.

00:13:01.746 --> 00:13:04.166
Before that you go round like this."

00:13:04.366 --> 00:13:06.416
"Oh God, when will this Sahaja Yoga come?"

00:13:06.646 --> 00:13:09.006
And he said: "So, but He'll meet me sometime?

00:13:09.206 --> 00:13:13.826
I hope Sahaja Yoga also comes some time."

00:13:14.136 --> 00:13:16.776
And he was quite disappointed.

00:13:16.986 --> 00:13:21.516
So he went and he asked him that: "What did you see with,

00:13:21.716 --> 00:13:25.066
there when you went to see God?" He said: "I saw that, you know,

00:13:25.276 --> 00:13:29.266
He passed a camel through the eye of an, of a needle."

00:13:29.486 --> 00:13:33.306
He said: "What? How is it possible? It's impossible!" -

00:13:33.536 --> 00:13:36.256
Now mental - "How is it possible,

00:13:36.456 --> 00:13:39.426
that a camel can pass through the eye, it's not possible,

00:13:39.626 --> 00:13:44.876
see the volume of this one and such a little thing. How can he pass?

00:13:45.076 --> 00:13:47.876
No, no, no, no you are just telling me a story because you have been to God,

00:13:48.076 --> 00:13:52.106
you are trying to show off, that's all. I, I don't believe in all this nonsense.

00:13:52.306 --> 00:13:55.806
You see, you are just telling me lies, and don't try to befool me."

00:13:56.006 --> 00:14:00.616
So he went to another person who was on the street eating nicely.

00:14:00.816 --> 00:14:03.596
He said: "How are you?" "Oh, I know He had arranged before you reached there,

00:14:03.806 --> 00:14:07.996
I know it was all right after all. You see, He looks after me all the time.

00:14:08.196 --> 00:14:13.696
So what did you see when you went there?" He said: "I saw that God Almighty

00:14:13.906 --> 00:14:20.686
passed a camel through an eye of a needle. It's a very amazing thing."

00:14:20.886 --> 00:14:26.096
He said: "What amazing thing? He is God, do you know He is God?

00:14:26.296 --> 00:14:33.176
Do you know He is God? God can do anything. He can do anything!"

00:14:33.376 --> 00:14:41.736
That's made him understand, that if you understand that God is all-powerful -

00:14:41.936 --> 00:14:46.136
all-powerful, it doesn't mean that He can move Himalayas to Maharashtra.

00:14:46.336 --> 00:14:49.456
It doesn't mean that!

00:14:58.826 --> 00:15:02.456
But it means He is all powerful.

00:15:02.656 --> 00:15:06.556
Means He can do subtlest and subtlest thing, and such things

00:15:06.756 --> 00:15:11.916
which our brain, this mental side cannot understand.

00:15:12.116 --> 00:15:18.006
It's beyond the conception of a human mind.

00:15:19.946 --> 00:15:23.396
This is what God is.

00:15:23.596 --> 00:15:26.236
He is the One who has created human beings.

00:15:26.436 --> 00:15:28.466
He has to be beyond us if He is creating.

00:15:28.666 --> 00:15:31.916
If a potter creates a pot that means he is beyond the pot.

00:15:32.116 --> 00:15:35.646
Pot cannot create God... the potter.

00:15:35.846 --> 00:15:41.346
And the potter has created the pot, so that means that this pot

00:15:41.546 --> 00:15:46.486
which is created by him has to be - something which is made by him,

00:15:46.686 --> 00:15:52.046
so he has to be much more powerful than the pot is.

00:15:53.546 --> 00:16:01.166
But it is unbelievable, or say, beyond the conception of human beings,

00:16:01.366 --> 00:16:11.116
that what a God it must be Who has made this great computer.

00:16:12.436 --> 00:16:15.686
We take everything for granted.

00:16:15.886 --> 00:16:21.806
We cannot even make a particle of clay ourself.

00:16:22.646 --> 00:16:25.526
We cannot make anything, human beings cannot make.

00:16:25.726 --> 00:16:28.746
Ha, if there is some stone, all right, you can put this up.

00:16:28.946 --> 00:16:33.716
If there is some clay, you can make some sort of a house out of it.

00:16:33.916 --> 00:16:37.306
But it’s all dead from the dead.

00:16:40.126 --> 00:16:51.606
But can you make a candle which will burn badhas?

00:16:55.826 --> 00:17:03.076
You have seen it with your own eyes that before My photograph the badhas burn.

00:17:03.276 --> 00:17:06.336
Can you do that?

00:17:08.916 --> 00:17:15.496
Now you, we have no, also the idea of the complete, intricate working,

00:17:15.696 --> 00:17:26.986
delicate machinery, and also very dynamic explosive machinery,

00:17:27.186 --> 00:17:32.666
how it works to create human beings, to create all this universe,

00:17:32.866 --> 00:17:39.996
to create all these beautiful flowers and trees and everything.

00:17:40.196 --> 00:17:44.966
Look at the stars. Look at how many they are.

00:17:45.166 --> 00:17:50.136
Out of that He has chosen this Mother Earth to create human beings.

00:17:50.346 --> 00:17:53.756
How He has made it?

00:17:55.916 --> 00:18:04.926
When He wants to send His own Son, He can send it the way He wants to send it.

00:18:06.496 --> 00:18:18.566
Even to challenge this shows the mental mind which is in, absolutely in mud.

00:18:22.296 --> 00:18:27.356
So to accept it is only possible

00:18:27.556 --> 00:18:31.516
when you have saints, real saints who tell you,

00:18:31.716 --> 00:18:38.206
that this is how Shri Ganesha was born out of Gauri.

00:18:42.496 --> 00:18:46.706
But to jump into it, into faith,

00:18:46.906 --> 00:18:53.036
when you come to Sahaja Yoga, you start seeing miracles taking place.

00:18:54.086 --> 00:18:58.406
Then you can understand that these miracles are taking place

00:18:58.616 --> 00:19:04.696
and if there is another miracle that has to take place it will take place in any case.

00:19:04.896 --> 00:19:09.366
We are not doing anything, it’s all done.

00:19:10.296 --> 00:19:16.536
And we don't doubt it. Once you doubt you become again the same

00:19:18.626 --> 00:19:24.026
human being which is just embedded in the mud.

00:19:25.756 --> 00:19:30.296
I always say that you are like lotuses now opened out.

00:19:30.506 --> 00:19:34.206
You are not flying in the air. Your roots are down there.

00:19:34.406 --> 00:19:39.716
But you are now lotuses,

00:19:39.916 --> 00:19:47.126
and that's what is on top of the lotus, this Mahalakshmi principle is born.

00:19:47.326 --> 00:19:53.836
Mahalakshmi principle is the One which came on this earth

00:19:54.036 --> 00:20:05.136
as Sitaji, as Radha and also as Mary, as Mother Mary.

00:20:05.456 --> 00:20:11.286
It's said that Mahalakshmi is born out of the sea.

00:20:11.486 --> 00:20:18.256
What is the meaning of "Mary"? Maria means, you know, Marine means "the sea".

00:20:20.006 --> 00:20:22.706
She was born out of the sea.

00:20:22.906 --> 00:20:29.576
So She being a Mahalakshmi Herself, She could create a child. What's the harm?

00:20:32.136 --> 00:20:35.566
She could do anything,

00:20:38.046 --> 00:20:41.486
and this is the thing you have to rise above.

00:20:41.686 --> 00:20:45.616
Christians have to rise above this Christianity,

00:20:45.816 --> 00:20:49.816
and has to understand that it's such a great thing that was Christ

00:20:50.016 --> 00:20:56.536
Who came on this earth, Who was the Incarnation of the principle of Ganesha.

00:20:56.736 --> 00:20:59.656
Ganesha becoming Mahavishnu is a very big thing

00:20:59.856 --> 00:21:02.936
which one should try to understand.

00:21:03.136 --> 00:21:10.006
Ganesha is the Son of Shiva.

00:21:10.866 --> 00:21:22.836
Shri Ganesha is the One Who was first created before creating anything,

00:21:24.046 --> 00:21:30.906
any atmosphere, anything, because He is the Omkara,

00:21:31.106 --> 00:21:37.136
and the Omkara is the first breaking of Adi Shakti from Shiva.

00:21:37.336 --> 00:21:42.246
That sound, "Tan-kar", as they call it. From there started Omkara

00:21:42.446 --> 00:21:47.496
and He is the One Who is the embodiment of that Omkara.

00:21:47.696 --> 00:21:51.526
So this sound is Shri Ganesh, is His power,

00:21:51.726 --> 00:22:00.036
was created first foremost thing, just to create holiness, pavitrata.

00:22:00.236 --> 00:22:04.476
When this holiness was created, this pavitrata was created,

00:22:04.686 --> 00:22:11.546
then everything was created in the sea of that holiness.

00:22:13.066 --> 00:22:20.866
And then He incarnated as Christ, but as Mahavishnu,

00:22:21.066 --> 00:22:26.566
not as Shiva's Son, but as Mahavishnu.

00:22:26.766 --> 00:22:34.486
And who is Vishnu? He is an uncle of Shri Ganesh.

00:22:35.306 --> 00:22:42.446
His Mother's brother is Shri Vishnu.

00:22:43.576 --> 00:22:49.336
So the, it was brought up, we should say, by Mahavishnu, we can say,

00:22:49.536 --> 00:22:56.186
but Mahalakshmi adopted the principle of Shri Ganesh.

00:22:56.386 --> 00:22:59.486
In the Kundalini chart you can see that the Shri Ganesha

00:22:59.686 --> 00:23:04.596
is connected on the left-hand side to the Ida Nadi,

00:23:08.116 --> 00:23:12.036
and the Kundalini is above that.

00:23:12.236 --> 00:23:19.306
So now what has happened is this, that He transcended that part,

00:23:19.506 --> 00:23:22.206
and if He had to come for the redemption,

00:23:22.406 --> 00:23:27.476
He had to come as the Son of Mahalakshmi.

00:23:27.676 --> 00:23:31.056
So it was Mahalakshmi who adopted Him,

00:23:31.256 --> 00:23:38.926
or we should say, really conceived Him within Himself as Christ,

00:23:42.196 --> 00:23:44.736
and He became Mahavishnu.

00:23:44.936 --> 00:23:53.456
Anything is possible in the family of Gods and Goddesses, because they are Gods.

00:23:55.466 --> 00:24:01.006
It is beyond human mind to understand how these things

00:24:01.206 --> 00:24:07.836
are working out in that realm. Very difficult.

00:24:08.396 --> 00:24:12.086
But now you have got Realization, you can feel in the cool breeze,

00:24:12.286 --> 00:24:16.656
so many new things are happening to you. So now believe Me,

00:24:16.856 --> 00:24:21.826
that there is no unholy alliances

00:24:22.026 --> 00:24:24.976
among the Gods and Goddesses, no unholy alliances.

00:24:25.176 --> 00:24:29.936
There is nothing that is human in them.

00:24:30.136 --> 00:24:36.396
They are all divine, pure people.

00:24:38.506 --> 00:24:41.806
Once you understand this point, then you will understand

00:24:42.016 --> 00:24:52.146
why Shri Ganesha had to accept to be a Son of Mahalakshmi,

00:24:52.346 --> 00:24:56.686
was born to Him as Christ.

00:24:56.886 --> 00:25:04.446
Because He had to come on Agnya, and for the redemption,

00:25:04.646 --> 00:25:10.226
as Ganesha, He doesn't do the redemption part,

00:25:10.426 --> 00:25:18.696
because at that stage He is for the innocence, for the holiness,

00:25:18.896 --> 00:25:26.036
for the wisdom or also for destroying a negativity.

00:25:26.236 --> 00:25:32.016
But He had to come up; only He,

00:25:32.216 --> 00:25:42.396
only Ganesha could be brought to this very constricted chakra, Agnya chakra.

00:25:43.286 --> 00:25:46.336
Now why is it constricted? It's quite a scientific thing

00:25:46.536 --> 00:25:49.186
which I would not like to discuss today.

00:25:49.386 --> 00:25:51.866
But it had to be constricted

00:25:52.066 --> 00:25:55.386
and it goes on getting more constricted, this Agnya chakra,

00:25:55.596 --> 00:26:02.906
the more, the more we think, the more we go into the left or right,

00:26:03.106 --> 00:26:07.656
it goes on really becoming like this, absolutely like this.

00:26:07.856 --> 00:26:15.736
So in this very subtle area only Christ could be settled,

00:26:15.936 --> 00:26:20.076
because He is the subtlest of subtle.

00:26:21.766 --> 00:26:26.646
He's even subtler than an atom, because in the atom

00:26:26.846 --> 00:26:31.426
those vibrations which move asymmetric and symmetric movements

00:26:31.626 --> 00:26:36.506
are subtler than the atom.

00:26:36.706 --> 00:26:39.926
And this is the subtler of that also.

00:26:40.126 --> 00:26:45.176
So in that little very constricted area,

00:26:45.376 --> 00:26:54.996
only a personality like Christ, which is nothing but purity.

00:26:55.196 --> 00:27:07.676
There is no other element in Him but purity.

00:27:08.216 --> 00:27:16.886
All other Incarnations have all the five elements in it.

00:27:17.086 --> 00:27:23.686
He has nothing. He is nothing but pure vibrations.

00:27:23.886 --> 00:27:27.616
That's why He could walk on the water,

00:27:27.816 --> 00:27:35.816
because there was no mass in His body, no matter in His body. No matter.

00:27:36.016 --> 00:27:41.346
No element, except for Chaitanya itself.

00:27:41.576 --> 00:27:46.936
Omkara becoming Ganesha in the mud,

00:27:47.136 --> 00:27:52.576
or the what you can say, the thing that came out of Her body.

00:27:52.776 --> 00:27:57.376
Only the Chaitanya. So at Ganesha's stage we can say

00:27:57.576 --> 00:28:02.266
that the Chaitanya was kept in that form,

00:28:02.466 --> 00:28:09.126
but in the state of Christ it was no longer there.

00:28:12.376 --> 00:28:17.986
But the whole drama was played later on, of His death and resurrection,

00:28:18.186 --> 00:28:22.236
because He is the One who is responsible for our resurrection,

00:28:22.436 --> 00:28:27.776
because He is the Gate. He is the Path because He is Shri Ganesh.

00:28:27.976 --> 00:28:34.176
Omkara is the Path, and He is the Gate, but He is not the destination.

00:28:37.246 --> 00:28:40.836
His Mother is the destination.

00:28:43.146 --> 00:28:47.746
Even Mahalakshmi is not the Destination. Even Mahakali, Mahasaraswati.

00:28:47.946 --> 00:28:53.436
It's the Adi Shakti is the destination where you have to reach.

00:28:54.796 --> 00:28:58.576
All these things were never told in the Bible

00:28:58.776 --> 00:29:04.346
because He could hardly live for four years with public life.

00:29:04.556 --> 00:29:09.146
Nor did they want to tell about it because they did not know.

00:29:09.346 --> 00:29:15.976
Also there was a definite suppression of all Divine things,

00:29:16.176 --> 00:29:20.816
for these people are all commercialized institutions,

00:29:21.016 --> 00:29:24.966
as we have also in India all kinds of commercial institutions.

00:29:25.166 --> 00:29:30.596
But the only advantage in India is that religion is not organized.

00:29:30.796 --> 00:29:33.416
Thank God for that!

00:29:33.616 --> 00:29:36.006
But they organized it, they organized Christ,

00:29:36.206 --> 00:29:38.966
they organized all His principles, everything,

00:29:39.166 --> 00:29:42.646
and now they think He was a good human being.

00:29:42.846 --> 00:29:45.996
What a certificate to give!

00:29:48.236 --> 00:29:53.606
So today we are here to celebrate the birth of Omkara.

00:29:53.806 --> 00:29:58.906
It's a very big thing. I don't know if you can realize it, what it is,

00:29:59.106 --> 00:30:06.526
which moves into everything, whether it is anu, paramanu, is the atom, molecules,

00:30:06.726 --> 00:30:13.996
into all the organizing of chemicals and also the periodic laws,

00:30:14.196 --> 00:30:23.356
and also in the gravity, into everything that moves is this Omkara,

00:30:23.556 --> 00:30:28.666
and your vibrations are nothing but Omkaras.

00:30:29.796 --> 00:30:34.036
Actually, in My photograph the vibrations have come as Omkaras.

00:30:34.236 --> 00:30:38.716
On the head of the people there is Omkara written.

00:30:39.296 --> 00:30:44.206
How is it happening, these lights look like Omkara?

00:30:44.416 --> 00:30:47.766
How is it on top of the heads of the Sahaja Yogis,

00:30:47.966 --> 00:30:51.786
there's - all the Sahaja Yogis' heads - there is Omkara?

00:30:51.986 --> 00:31:00.866
Or Allah in Arabic language, My name also, in Arabic?

00:31:02.636 --> 00:31:05.976
Who is doing this?

00:31:08.756 --> 00:31:12.566
It is He who is doing all those things.

00:31:12.776 --> 00:31:22.076
So Omkara itself takes a form to do things to convince you of Adi Shakti.

00:31:22.276 --> 00:31:29.776
He is the One who is handling all these powers.

00:31:31.586 --> 00:31:36.586
He doesn't enter into the photograph, no, He does not,

00:31:36.786 --> 00:31:40.446
but He plays a trick.

00:31:43.106 --> 00:31:46.686
After all you see, if you go into details, how do you get a photograph?

00:31:46.886 --> 00:31:52.266
Through the light. The light passes straight, in a straight line.

00:31:52.466 --> 00:31:57.006
But if He wants, He can make the light pass another way round.

00:31:57.206 --> 00:32:00.766
He can just transform the light into something else.

00:32:00.966 --> 00:32:04.056
He can do whatever He likes.

00:32:04.256 --> 00:32:08.436
And that's what He does to convince you.

00:32:08.636 --> 00:32:11.836
And He said that "Anything against Me I'll tolerate,

00:32:12.046 --> 00:32:15.606
but nothing against the Holy Ghost."

00:32:15.806 --> 00:32:20.156
And this Holy Ghost is the Adi Shakti.

00:32:21.696 --> 00:32:28.946
Without Him you cannot go to the Sahasrara.

00:32:29.146 --> 00:32:32.396
So the in the whole play He is like the sutra dhara,

00:32:32.596 --> 00:32:36.396
He is the One who is the conductor,

00:32:36.596 --> 00:32:43.156
the One moves the strings in a puppet show.

00:32:43.356 --> 00:32:46.226
And so it is very important to pray to Shri Ganesha,

00:32:46.426 --> 00:32:49.276
every time we have Puja, we have to pray to Him

00:32:49.476 --> 00:32:55.976
and we, that's how we are praying to Lord Jesus Christ. Every time.

00:32:56.176 --> 00:33:01.536
Without His auspiciousness, without His help, we cannot do Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:01.746 --> 00:33:08.296
He is the Manager. See, I am sitting here and He is the manager.

00:33:08.496 --> 00:33:12.436
Supposing there is no management, how will I speak here?

00:33:12.636 --> 00:33:15.856
Nothing can happen. But He is so efficient,

00:33:16.066 --> 00:33:21.016
and you never see Him working out everything, doing everything.

00:33:22.116 --> 00:33:26.386
You all would not have understood everything I said in English.

00:33:27.496 --> 00:33:30.126
And today is Jesus Christ’s birthday.

00:33:31.146 --> 00:33:36.686
Jesus Christ, what a great personality He is, that’s what I was telling them.

00:33:36.936 --> 00:33:42.596
We people pray to Shri Ganesha, worship Him, because others told us to do so.

00:33:43.376 --> 00:33:46.426
But what is He? Who is Shri Ganesha?

00:33:46.626 --> 00:33:49.836
We say that He is Omkara. What is Omkara?

00:33:52.006 --> 00:33:56.796
All the functions of this whole universe, are done by the power of this Omkara,

00:33:56.996 --> 00:34:00.656
which we call as “chaitanya”, as “Bramha chaitanya”.

00:34:01.056 --> 00:34:05.746
The physical manifestation of Brahma chaitanya is Omkara,

00:34:06.006 --> 00:34:07.876
and the idol form of that,

00:34:08.076 --> 00:34:11.156
or the iconic form of that, is Shri Ganesha.

00:34:11.476 --> 00:34:14.836
And the incarnation of that (Brahma chaiytnya)

00:34:16.086 --> 00:34:17.366
is Jesus Christ.

00:34:19.966 --> 00:34:21.696
If you understand this point,

00:34:21.896 --> 00:34:26.346
we sing frantically people when we worship Shri Ganesha.

00:34:27.296 --> 00:34:30.646
We should realize what we are saying in each and every word.

00:34:32.066 --> 00:34:34.806
We are describing His powers.

00:34:35.786 --> 00:34:36.926
Why are we doing this?

00:34:37.136 --> 00:34:41.586
Whoever has powers, supposing I have some powers, and you have some powers,

00:34:41.786 --> 00:34:44.346
then what is the need to describe them?

00:34:45.096 --> 00:34:47.786
So that we also achieve those powers,

00:34:48.176 --> 00:34:50.996
and with those powers, we also become powerful.

00:34:51.196 --> 00:34:53.466
That is why we worship Shri Ganesha.

00:34:54.056 --> 00:34:56.856
The greatest of His powers is purity.

00:34:57.416 --> 00:35:00.486
Anything that is pure is most powerful..

00:35:00.886 --> 00:35:02.656
Nobody can touch it.

00:35:03.056 --> 00:35:06.006
For example, a soap. No matter how many times you use it,

00:35:06.206 --> 00:35:08.796
or wash it with anything, it doesn’t get dirty.

00:35:10.246 --> 00:35:12.726
For once, even soap may also get dirty,

00:35:13.076 --> 00:35:15.976
but this Omkar is holy, pure,

00:35:17.376 --> 00:35:21.616
and eternal being,

00:35:21.906 --> 00:35:26.856
or it is a power, which can work eternally.

00:35:27.576 --> 00:35:32.406
When you worship this power, you should remember,

00:35:32.606 --> 00:35:36.466
that, we want to absorb this power within us,

00:35:36.736 --> 00:35:40.766
so that, we become completely pure and all our chakras get cleared.

00:35:40.966 --> 00:35:42.926
Our lives become pure,

00:35:43.136 --> 00:35:50.036
our society, politics, country, and the whole world get purified.

00:35:51.076 --> 00:35:53.076
And in that purity lies the joy.

00:35:53.376 --> 00:35:55.306
When something becomes very clean,

00:35:55.506 --> 00:35:58.616
for example when you have a bath and you wear a clean dress,

00:35:58.816 --> 00:36:00.236
then you feel very nice.

00:36:00.436 --> 00:36:03.096
But, when your whole life,

00:36:04.226 --> 00:36:06.486
gets purified by this Omkar,

00:36:07.106 --> 00:36:08.066
then..

00:36:09.446 --> 00:36:13.616
..we call it as “Atmanand”, (joy of spirit), we achieve that.

00:36:15.536 --> 00:36:17.536
And in the atma (spirit) also,

00:36:18.176 --> 00:36:21.936
the prevailing power is that of “Omkara” only.

00:36:23.466 --> 00:36:26.596
But we do not understand what Omkara is.

00:36:27.776 --> 00:36:32.066
We just say it is something like “ardha matra” (half a syllable).

00:36:32.686 --> 00:36:36.336
But, we don’t understand what exactly it is.

00:36:38.136 --> 00:36:43.776
And these four powers,”chatvari”, which are Shri Ganesha’s powers,

00:36:44.616 --> 00:36:50.576
you see the advent of the same in the life of Jesus Christ

00:36:51.476 --> 00:36:54.276
But He was alive only for four years.

00:36:54.646 --> 00:37:02.176
And somehow, people were not much aware about him in India,

00:37:02.476 --> 00:37:06.116
But in western countries, people started following Him.

00:37:06.396 --> 00:37:10.056
Now these people have only brain and nothing else.

00:37:10.396 --> 00:37:13.086
They have no heart, nothing, but only brain.

00:37:13.296 --> 00:37:14.946
So in that brain,

00:37:17.006 --> 00:37:20.296
how can such a subtle thing enter?

00:37:23.296 --> 00:37:25.846
To understand this subtle thing

00:37:26.436 --> 00:37:29.106
in the mind of a human being,

00:37:30.646 --> 00:37:32.896
the intellect should awaken, meaning,

00:37:33.106 --> 00:37:37.296
within him that sensitivity should come,

00:37:37.496 --> 00:37:46.436
by which he gets filled, with abundance of light.

00:37:46.746 --> 00:37:48.466
Gets flooded with light.

00:37:48.666 --> 00:37:50.276
In that light...

00:37:50.416 --> 00:37:55.596
normally, you see that when this light is falls on eyes, it blinks off.

00:37:55.996 --> 00:37:58.636
But the light that comes from within,

00:37:58.876 --> 00:38:02.686
doesn’t blur your eyes, but in that light everything is visible.

00:38:03.796 --> 00:38:06.896
To achieve that enlightenment of the spirit,

00:38:07.986 --> 00:38:11.206
You see the agnya chakra, this chakra is exactly above the “Medha” (brain).

00:38:11.406 --> 00:38:12.626
This is Medha,

00:38:12.906 --> 00:38:16.176
which is known as brain plate, agnya chakra is on it here.

00:38:16.796 --> 00:38:19.056
When Medha opens,

00:38:20.096 --> 00:38:23.156
meaning Medha is like this “closed”.

00:38:23.566 --> 00:38:26.266
When it opens, that is when we say agnya chakra has opened.

00:38:26.466 --> 00:38:29.696
And when kundalini comes up from inside this,

00:38:30.756 --> 00:38:33.956
and when it covers the upper part of Medha,

00:38:34.596 --> 00:38:37.276
then in the intellect of human being

00:38:39.206 --> 00:38:40.726
a special...

00:38:41.986 --> 00:38:44.166
which is beyond human being,

00:38:44.366 --> 00:38:46.826
beyond the intelligence of human,

00:38:47.286 --> 00:38:53.766
a special divine power, gets awakened.

00:38:54.266 --> 00:38:56.366
And with this divine power

00:38:56.786 --> 00:39:01.766
you start understanding what is truth and what is untruth.

00:39:02.556 --> 00:39:05.676
You feel the same power in your hands also.

00:39:05.996 --> 00:39:09.166
Gradually, you don’t even have to check your hands for anything,

00:39:09.366 --> 00:39:11.506
you will know it just like that.

00:39:11.756 --> 00:39:14.636
You will at once understand this is false or that is good.

00:39:14.836 --> 00:39:18.626
But some people start understanding this very soon,

00:39:18.846 --> 00:39:22.996
I say that such people have been blessed by Jesus Christ.

00:39:23.376 --> 00:39:26.726
And some people remain stuck in the vortex of mind.

00:39:26.926 --> 00:39:30.136
For example, being stuck in useless religions,

00:39:30.346 --> 00:39:31.796
or in caste and creed,

00:39:31.996 --> 00:39:36.346
and thinking that “I like Indians only” or “I like English only”.

00:39:36.546 --> 00:39:40.746
These kind of thoughts, narrow mindedness, conservatism,

00:39:40.956 --> 00:39:43.876
And miserliness and many others.

00:39:44.076 --> 00:39:49.096
Especially, our country, is full of many kind of parasites, mosquitoes, bugs, (referring to humans)

00:39:49.296 --> 00:39:51.406
which are not found anywhere else.

00:39:51.606 --> 00:39:55.796
Whatever (nonsense) is found here, is not found anywhere else.

00:39:56.376 --> 00:40:00.276
To what extent, a human can fall into a pit,

00:40:00.476 --> 00:40:03.486
one can see only in this country. Sometimes it is very surprising,

00:40:03.686 --> 00:40:06.466
that in the country where great incarnations took birth,

00:40:06.976 --> 00:40:09.506
the culture of which is full of devotion,

00:40:09.766 --> 00:40:15.516
where Lord is worshipped, in such a place, by this kind of filth,

00:40:16.346 --> 00:40:19.336
and this kind of conservative attitude,

00:40:19.636 --> 00:40:23.346
we are decaying ourselves and continuing do so.

00:40:23.686 --> 00:40:26.386
After coming to Sahaja Yoga, we should leave all this at least.

00:40:26.586 --> 00:40:30.316
But even now this caste creed, and all such things,

00:40:30.516 --> 00:40:33.496
is still making us like insects (lower beings).

00:40:34.416 --> 00:40:38.416
So this “Vishwa Nirmal Dharma”, this religion

00:40:39.346 --> 00:40:42.266
is that of “Omkara”, is that of holiness.

00:40:42.466 --> 00:40:45.366
In this, if you are still continuing with all these things,

00:40:45.576 --> 00:40:49.366
then you can not get into this "dharma", And no matter how much you say,

00:40:49.566 --> 00:40:54.576
that, “We worship Mataji, we use Her photo, and we follow Her"

00:40:57.566 --> 00:41:01.066
By this neither you are going to gain anything,

00:41:01.756 --> 00:41:04.506
nor the world is going to benefit anything.

00:41:04.816 --> 00:41:06.506
It is something like if a lamp says..

00:41:06.706 --> 00:41:10.096
”I have light, so I am giving light to everyone”.

00:41:10.296 --> 00:41:13.516
What if someone asks, ”Where is your light? Show us.”

00:41:14.246 --> 00:41:16.816
We are deceiving ourselves.

00:41:17.436 --> 00:41:21.086
So whoever is in Sahaja Yoga, first they should completely convince themselves,

00:41:21.296 --> 00:41:23.816
that now we are not going to deceive ourselves.

00:41:24.016 --> 00:41:28.216
“We are going to leave this completely and get deeper into Sahaja Yoga”.

00:41:28.946 --> 00:41:31.226
Only then you will benefit out of it.

00:41:31.466 --> 00:41:36.096
I also see what happens to the half baked people.

00:41:38.216 --> 00:41:43.756
It is possible that because of going to some Guru you may have problems.

00:41:44.386 --> 00:41:48.406
Or because of the wrong company also you may have problems.

00:41:48.606 --> 00:41:55.686
Because now we are in that era, which we call as "Kruti Yuga",

00:41:55.896 --> 00:42:00.216
where this brahma chaitanya (vibrations) has become active. It works.

00:42:00.846 --> 00:42:02.176
Now you,

00:42:03.286 --> 00:42:07.406
can neither deceive yourself nor you can cheat Me.

00:42:08.126 --> 00:42:12.706
Whoever adopts the path of deception, will bear the consequences.

00:42:15.996 --> 00:42:17.666
One gentleman came to me and said,

00:42:17.866 --> 00:42:21.136
“Mother, when I meditate, my face becomes this big”.

00:42:21.336 --> 00:42:22.846
I said, ”Is that so?,

00:42:24.106 --> 00:42:26.926
How does it look like?" He said, “Like Hanumana”

00:42:27.336 --> 00:42:29.686
I said,  "It's good right that you are becoming like Hanumana”.

00:42:29.886 --> 00:42:31.886
He said, “No Mother, I feel worried that my face may burst."

00:42:32.076 --> 00:42:33.986
“You chew tobacco, right”?

00:42:34.256 --> 00:42:35.676
“Yes, That is right”.

00:42:36.016 --> 00:42:38.776
I said, ”Then chew tobacco, why do you meditate”?

00:42:40.436 --> 00:42:42.906
“You want to chew tobacco and meditate as well,

00:42:43.106 --> 00:42:45.376
then obviously the face will bloat."

00:42:48.016 --> 00:42:53.206
Another gentleman came, and said ”See Mother, my this finger is cut”.

00:42:54.076 --> 00:42:55.866
“Alright, were you smoking?”

00:42:56.066 --> 00:42:58.756
He said, “Yes”. “So this finger of mine got hurt”.

00:42:58.956 --> 00:43:02.116
Another man met with a car accident.

00:43:02.986 --> 00:43:05.376
He came and told that “Mother, only this finger is gone”.

00:43:05.576 --> 00:43:08.026
“Only this is hurt (index finger) because I smoke”.

00:43:08.276 --> 00:43:12.506
You come to Sahaja Yoga and still smoke and consume liquor.

00:43:12.726 --> 00:43:14.726
And you do all other things,

00:43:14.956 --> 00:43:18.256
And you claim to be a Sahaja Yogi, roaming around with a big badge.

00:43:18.456 --> 00:43:23.456
The same badge which you are wearing, is going to break your head, let me warn you.

00:43:24.046 --> 00:43:27.686
If you think that it is a simple thing to wear a badge, then it is not so.

00:43:27.876 --> 00:43:29.426
The badge which you are wearing

00:43:29.626 --> 00:43:33.686
will break your head, which I don’t want, I don't break.

00:43:33.966 --> 00:43:37.736
But understand that this badge is not an ordinary thing.

00:43:38.176 --> 00:43:42.346
It has a coefficient. Meaning, vibrations flow out of it.

00:43:43.096 --> 00:43:45.846
The same vibrations, if encircles your throat and strangles you,

00:43:46.046 --> 00:43:48.296
then you will say, “Mother, I was sleeping with the badge on,

00:43:48.496 --> 00:43:50.556
then how did this happen to me?

00:43:50.956 --> 00:43:54.446
The same badge that you were wearing, came out and broke your skull.

00:43:54.736 --> 00:43:55.796
So don’t put on the badge.

00:43:55.996 --> 00:43:59.246
But if you want to use it, then be worthy of it.

00:44:01.066 --> 00:44:04.546
These days everyone says ”Mother, give a badge,

00:44:04.746 --> 00:44:07.086
we want to wear it in the neck as locket."

00:44:07.286 --> 00:44:10.896
See, you wear it but with caution, do you get it?

00:44:11.256 --> 00:44:14.096
Don’t blame it on me later that,

00:44:14.346 --> 00:44:18.776
"Mother, I wore this and went, still I slipped and my leg broke“.

00:44:19.246 --> 00:44:22.016
That badge only made you slip, so don’t wear it.

00:44:22.346 --> 00:44:23.446
If you want to wear it,

00:44:23.656 --> 00:44:27.436
then you should be eligible and worthy of it.

00:44:28.036 --> 00:44:30.526
And if you are not worthy,

00:44:30.726 --> 00:44:33.736
then God save you from Jesus Christ.

00:44:34.276 --> 00:44:36.726
And Shri Ganesha is even ahead of Him.

00:44:36.936 --> 00:44:41.076
He has the axe ('parshu") in His left hand and can hit easily, then what can I do?

00:44:41.706 --> 00:44:45.766
Now, He will not listen to me, since you have worn it,

00:44:45.966 --> 00:44:48.956
then He says, “Now face the consequence”.

00:44:49.776 --> 00:44:51.776
So, to wear this badge,

00:44:52.276 --> 00:44:53.276
or,

00:44:54.436 --> 00:44:56.796
to wear the pendant, to wear the ring,

00:44:56.996 --> 00:45:00.016
Oh my God! Be very careful!

00:45:00.286 --> 00:45:03.386
When you go to washroom, remove them

00:45:03.886 --> 00:45:05.406
and keep carefully.

00:45:06.496 --> 00:45:10.376
About My hair also I have told people to be careful please.

00:45:10.706 --> 00:45:14.216
These hair have been given by “Yama” (God of death).

00:45:14.556 --> 00:45:16.166
He is always behind them.

00:45:16.366 --> 00:45:19.006
So, please, if you see them lying anywhere,

00:45:19.206 --> 00:45:21.326
be kind enough to return them to Me.

00:45:21.526 --> 00:45:25.446
I don’t want you to face any problem, because I am a mother also.

00:45:25.676 --> 00:45:29.116
But these people (deities) are not your mother or father.

00:45:29.646 --> 00:45:31.646
They are your brothers.

00:45:34.796 --> 00:45:37.056
They move around you with a stick.

00:45:37.626 --> 00:45:40.696
So understand that if you have come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:45:41.376 --> 00:45:44.496
It is so joy giving with bhajan and all..

00:45:45.496 --> 00:45:47.726
but then from where did you get hit?

00:45:50.206 --> 00:45:51.466
So that’s why,

00:45:51.886 --> 00:45:54.756
the specialty of Sahaja Yoga should be understood,

00:45:55.126 --> 00:45:57.436
that this is the knowledge of the God Almighty.

00:45:57.646 --> 00:46:01.136
The Almighty God is not a Mother.

00:46:04.036 --> 00:46:05.676
Mother is all affectionate.

00:46:05.886 --> 00:46:08.146
She understands that these are my children,

00:46:08.346 --> 00:46:11.246
sometimes they do this or do that, it’s alright.

00:46:12.776 --> 00:46:13.816
But,

00:46:15.296 --> 00:46:17.386
The God Almighty is watching,

00:46:19.366 --> 00:46:21.366
how you all are behaving?

00:46:23.256 --> 00:46:28.766
And after a lot of hard work, I, your Mother gave you Sahaja Yoga,

00:46:30.516 --> 00:46:33.456
Then where are you still lacking?

00:46:34.986 --> 00:46:37.486
What mistake are you doing now?

00:46:38.886 --> 00:46:41.896
And so you should act with understanding.

00:46:43.596 --> 00:46:47.926
But, I would say that, Adishakti is definitely the power of the God almighty,

00:46:48.876 --> 00:46:50.346
She is His desire.

00:46:50.976 --> 00:46:53.696
But, The God almighty, is watching,

00:46:54.436 --> 00:46:56.906
that all the hard work that is being done,

00:46:57.106 --> 00:46:59.476
and in the drama created by Her,

00:46:59.676 --> 00:47:02.446
how many are real and fake.

00:47:02.836 --> 00:47:06.526
And He is noting, who all should be put right.

00:47:07.076 --> 00:47:10.336
Whoever is good, also should be noted, is it?

00:47:10.536 --> 00:47:11.816
It’s not like that.

00:47:12.356 --> 00:47:15.866
But whoever is insincere, He will catch them.

00:47:16.456 --> 00:47:18.156
And He will give everybody a blow.

00:47:18.366 --> 00:47:19.966
That is why, please,

00:47:20.426 --> 00:47:24.476
whatever you do, do with a clean heart, a open heart

00:47:24.636 --> 00:47:29.076
Whatever I have told you, that if you have blind faith,

00:47:29.236 --> 00:47:31.496
or if you still have casteism within you,

00:47:31.636 --> 00:47:34.736
or if you have “we Indians are great” kind of feeling within you,

00:47:34.916 --> 00:47:36.936
Or any such feeling,

00:47:36.936 --> 00:47:39.696
which are false, which have no purity,

00:47:39.946 --> 00:47:43.756
You get rid of all such feelings, and then wear my pendant, please!

00:47:43.956 --> 00:47:47.376
Because with each pendant one “Gana” is attached.

00:47:48.576 --> 00:47:50.676
And they (ganas) are around you.

00:47:50.956 --> 00:47:52.786
They always protect you,

00:47:52.986 --> 00:47:57.486
In this way also, they protect you from doing wrong things.

00:48:01.846 --> 00:48:04.506
Because, they know you in and out.

00:48:05.276 --> 00:48:10.626
So, today it was important to give you this warning.

00:48:11.716 --> 00:48:14.376
Otherwise also, it is a very happy occasion,

00:48:14.646 --> 00:48:20.286
that if, Jesus Christ had not come in this world,

00:48:20.876 --> 00:48:24.396
and if he had not taken his seat on Agnya Chakra,

00:48:25.016 --> 00:48:28.426
and made the path to salvation,

00:48:28.896 --> 00:48:33.346
path of resurrection, then Sahaja Yoga wouldn’t have been possible.

00:48:33.646 --> 00:48:35.756
It was very essential that He took birth.

00:48:35.956 --> 00:48:39.076
But they (incarnations) have no fight among themselves.

00:48:39.276 --> 00:48:41.606
They are all born on one single tree,

00:48:41.806 --> 00:48:44.576
on a living tree they all took birth,

00:48:44.776 --> 00:48:49.196
and this tree was nurtured, to come up to Sahasrara,

00:48:49.276 --> 00:48:51.796
and at that Sahasrara, it could be worked out.

00:48:52.836 --> 00:48:55.756
But if there is no tree, then how can Sahasrara be there?

00:48:56.496 --> 00:49:00.796
And if the Sahasrara is there, then this tree has created that Sahasrara.

00:49:00.996 --> 00:49:05.686
So, it is the responsibility of the tree also to take care of the Sahasrara,

00:49:06.646 --> 00:49:11.866
and protect it completely, and punish those who go against it.

00:49:15.306 --> 00:49:21.016
So, this day is of special importance, for all of you,

00:49:21.136 --> 00:49:22.906
because if Jesus Christ had not come,

00:49:23.106 --> 00:49:26.046
then, our resurrection wouldn’t have happened.

00:49:26.246 --> 00:49:31.076
It is said to Shri Ganesha that when our time for "moksha" comes,

00:49:31.276 --> 00:49:33.056
you please protect us.

00:49:33.486 --> 00:49:34.756
It is commonly said.

00:49:35.836 --> 00:49:38.616
That You (Shri Ganesh) protect us at the time of "Moksha".

00:49:38.776 --> 00:49:44.776
At the time of "Moksha", he manifests on Agnya chakra and gives you protection.

00:49:47.276 --> 00:49:51.136
So today’s day is very auspicious for all of us,

00:49:51.526 --> 00:49:54.736
very joy giving day also,

00:49:54.946 --> 00:49:58.866
and at the same time cautions us also, that “Be careful”.

00:49:59.306 --> 00:50:02.076
And if you get stuck in “Agnya chakra”,

00:50:02.506 --> 00:50:05.116
then you will end up either in a mental asylum,

00:50:09.036 --> 00:50:11.326
or you will get some other disease.

00:50:11.526 --> 00:50:16.186
Agnya chakra's purity should be intact, means our thoughts should always be pure.

00:50:16.386 --> 00:50:20.846
If impure thoughts come, then we should keep on forgiving them.

00:50:21.366 --> 00:50:23.286
Thoughts should always be pure.

00:50:23.486 --> 00:50:27.646
And as you start ascending, you will not get impure thoughts,

00:50:27.856 --> 00:50:29.856
only pure thoughts will come.

00:50:30.546 --> 00:50:35.656
Sahaja Yoga is made only for your joy,

00:50:35.996 --> 00:50:38.786
for your greatness,

00:50:38.986 --> 00:50:40.686
for your dignity,

00:50:40.936 --> 00:50:44.866
and for your over all progress.

00:50:45.616 --> 00:50:50.016
But it is also there that, whosoever,

00:50:52.546 --> 00:50:54.996
for this great work,

00:50:55.556 --> 00:50:59.806
and for the people who are completely attached with this work,

00:51:00.206 --> 00:51:04.956
whosoever, does not co-operate and provide their support,

00:51:05.466 --> 00:51:08.216
they may also get into troubles.

00:51:09.576 --> 00:51:12.296
Those who are doing this work wholeheartedly,

00:51:12.496 --> 00:51:15.556
you should support them wholeheartedly.

00:51:15.756 --> 00:51:20.796
In many people now I am noticing the disease of miserliness.

00:51:22.266 --> 00:51:27.386
There are people who will even save Rs.4 if they can by any means.

00:51:28.386 --> 00:51:32.556
If you try to save 4 rupees, you will lose at least 400 rupees,

00:51:32.756 --> 00:51:34.006
just like that.

00:51:36.006 --> 00:51:39.866
And even 1 rupee given in Sahaja Yoga, can be equal to 1 lakh rupees.

00:51:40.066 --> 00:51:43.206
Meaning, even one rupee can be enough, that’s what I am telling you.

00:51:43.608 --> 00:51:46.536
But we are not giving anything, everything belongs to Mother,

00:51:46.736 --> 00:51:48.446
we are giving to Mother, what is Hers.

00:51:48.656 --> 00:51:51.746
And, I don’t take anything, you know that I try to resist daily,

00:51:51.946 --> 00:51:53.416
that don’t give me presents,

00:51:53.616 --> 00:51:56.046
I don’t want anything, don’t give Me sarees,

00:51:56.246 --> 00:51:58.916
From morning to evening, since 5 years the struggle is going on,

00:51:59.116 --> 00:52:02.146
no one listens, I have been asking them to reduce buying gifts,

00:52:02.346 --> 00:52:05.896
Now the prices also are increasing, and I don’t need anything.

00:52:06.386 --> 00:52:09.536
But for Sahaja Yoga money is required.

00:52:10.216 --> 00:52:15.106
But even such people exist, who feel great about eating free food.

00:52:18.446 --> 00:52:22.576
Later if they have stomach problem, then I am not responsible for that.

00:52:27.316 --> 00:52:30.256
And this place is not for beggars.

00:52:30.836 --> 00:52:33.956
This is for people who are wealthy by attitude.

00:52:34.246 --> 00:52:36.496
If you have the attitude of a king, then come here.

00:52:36.696 --> 00:52:39.086
There is no need that you should have money.

00:52:39.296 --> 00:52:41.756
Many rich people are extremely miserly,

00:52:41.956 --> 00:52:44.966
and so peculiar that it is difficult to understand them,

00:52:45.166 --> 00:52:47.386
And many poor people are like Me,

00:52:47.586 --> 00:52:50.746
that they find joy in just giving to others.

00:52:51.116 --> 00:52:54.126
When your one hand opens you take from it.

00:52:54.326 --> 00:52:56.866
But only when the other hand opens to give, you will get from the first hand,

00:52:57.066 --> 00:52:58.926
otherwise it will stop flowing.

00:53:00.036 --> 00:53:04.456
When I hear about miserliness, I feel so disgusted, you cannot imagine.

00:53:06.966 --> 00:53:11.036
But, I liked it the other day, when there was nothing to give,

00:53:11.236 --> 00:53:13.846
people accepted my photo with affection.

00:53:14.046 --> 00:53:17.736
“Mother, please give us your photo this time". It felt so good.

00:53:18.016 --> 00:53:19.336
That contentment,

00:53:21.376 --> 00:53:22.896
should come first.

00:53:23.116 --> 00:53:27.976
Nobody can do what Jesus Christ did, but after getting content, a human being,

00:53:28.336 --> 00:53:32.056
is able to sacrifice happily.

00:53:32.436 --> 00:53:35.066
It may be a bit difficult, but it doesn’t matter.

00:53:35.456 --> 00:53:37.616
But we all are part of a great mission.

00:53:37.816 --> 00:53:41.216
And not just for us, we are doing it for all others.

00:53:44.116 --> 00:53:46.036
Next year I am going to get your name list.

00:53:46.236 --> 00:53:49.296
and I want to see, specially, about the complain on Mumbai people,

00:53:49.496 --> 00:53:52.616
that, they completely refuse to pay money.

00:53:53.186 --> 00:53:56.346
And see ironically, Mahalakshmi temple is in Mumbai.

00:53:57.056 --> 00:53:59.876
What is the benefit of that Mahalakshmi temple?

00:54:00.076 --> 00:54:02.646
Where Mahalakshmi Herself came out of the earth,

00:54:02.846 --> 00:54:07.636
and people of such place are so miserly that, they do not want to pay at all,

00:54:07.936 --> 00:54:12.796
thinking that Mother is doing everything, so come, let us just relax and enjoy.

00:54:13.746 --> 00:54:16.776
As such everything will happen whether they pay or not,

00:54:17.066 --> 00:54:19.596
But what will happen to them,

00:54:20.126 --> 00:54:21.496
think of that.

00:54:24.496 --> 00:54:29.636
The Mahalakshmi principle is that, when we find contentment inside,

00:54:29.846 --> 00:54:34.106
when the Lakshmi principle attains maturity, the Mahalakshmi principle gets awakened,

00:54:34.316 --> 00:54:36.656
After which we start searching the truth.

00:54:38.316 --> 00:54:40.616
If there is no contentment within you,

00:54:41.286 --> 00:54:43.856
you cannot attain the Mahalakshmi principle.

00:54:46.066 --> 00:54:50.446
Look at Seeta Ji’s life, how long did she stay with Ramchandra Ji?

00:54:50.646 --> 00:54:52.126
Radha Ji’s life,

00:54:52.326 --> 00:54:56.186
And after that Shri Jesus Christ’s Mother’s life?

00:54:56.656 --> 00:54:58.976
In all the three lives there is plenty of sacrifice.

00:54:59.216 --> 00:55:04.056
without great contentment, it is not possible.

00:55:04.266 --> 00:55:07.526
So with the Mahalakshmi principle human becomes contented,

00:55:07.766 --> 00:55:08.766
and

00:55:10.066 --> 00:55:13.666
with this principle he seeks the truth,

00:55:14.296 --> 00:55:17.896
And during this seeking, the falsehood goes away from him.

00:55:18.806 --> 00:55:21.676
In today’s Mahalakshmi Puja,

00:55:21.876 --> 00:55:27.196
where in we are worshipping Jesus Christ, and His Mother Mary

00:55:27.446 --> 00:55:30.296
then we should get into total contentment.

00:55:33.226 --> 00:55:38.096
When we get satisfied with materialistic things and worldly things,

00:55:38.766 --> 00:55:42.336
only then the Mahalakshmi principle awakens within us.

00:55:43.256 --> 00:55:48.736
And then, the Mahalakshmi Principle manages the Lakshmi principle.

00:55:50.066 --> 00:55:53.696
And Lakshmi Principle starts manifesting by itself,

00:55:54.156 --> 00:55:58.376
works out by itself and gives the benefit automatically.

00:55:58.686 --> 00:56:01.976
Automatically everything constructive happens.

00:56:10.706 --> 00:56:14.656
So, I just have to tell you that expand your heart,

00:56:15.366 --> 00:56:16.736
make it large.

00:56:16.996 --> 00:56:20.256
And establish that Omkara within your heart,

00:56:20.546 --> 00:56:24.766
establish the essence of the spirit, establish Jesus Christ and Ganesha,

00:56:25.066 --> 00:56:26.686
because of whom,

00:56:30.306 --> 00:56:32.846
all our problems will be solved,

00:56:33.326 --> 00:56:35.856
and your right on me will be established.

00:56:36.426 --> 00:56:40.826
Without them I can not give you any right.

00:56:42.116 --> 00:56:47.096
In the raising of Kundalini also, until, from the Mooladhara

00:56:49.726 --> 00:56:56.386
the permission doesn’t come, unless the Ganesha, present in mooladhar says: ” Yes”,

00:56:57.416 --> 00:57:00.816
not only Me, but no one can raise the Kundalini.

00:57:02.286 --> 00:57:05.056
These are His reserved rights.

00:57:06.646 --> 00:57:09.556
If anybody thinks that they are very close to Mother,

00:57:09.766 --> 00:57:12.786
then they should understand that even if they are close,

00:57:12.986 --> 00:57:19.486
for real if they are close, then that is also with Shri Ganesha’s consent,

00:57:19.766 --> 00:57:21.686
with Jesus Christ’s consent.

00:57:22.956 --> 00:57:26.576
Without their consent, I can not accept anyone.

00:57:26.906 --> 00:57:28.906
This is a bondage among us,

00:57:29.456 --> 00:57:33.496
that’s why I tell you again and again that “Be careful”.

00:57:34.186 --> 00:57:36.496
Their bondage has to be accepted.

00:57:36.756 --> 00:57:42.136
And whatever is their opinion about you,

00:57:42.526 --> 00:57:44.736
whatever they think about you,

00:57:44.996 --> 00:57:47.336
I have to take into consideration.

00:57:47.776 --> 00:57:51.796
No matter how much I forgive, being a Mother, whatever I may say,

00:57:51.996 --> 00:57:54.156
but I can't win over them. (Jesus and Ganesha).

00:57:54.356 --> 00:58:00.176
And know that, “They” themselves will help you, will cleanse you,

00:58:00.526 --> 00:58:02.306
will do everything for you,

00:58:02.506 --> 00:58:06.236
but “They” have one expectation from you, I have no expectations, I am without expectations,

00:58:06.436 --> 00:58:09.646
I don’t want anything from you, however you are it is fine.

00:58:09.846 --> 00:58:15.816
But, “They” have one expectation that, if you say or do anything against Me,

00:58:16.326 --> 00:58:19.576
or if you do any kind of “pettiness” in Sahaja Yoga,

00:58:19.776 --> 00:58:24.286
or you do any kind of cheating or any such thing, then “They” will be behind you.

00:58:24.496 --> 00:58:26.586
That’s why I am telling you again and again,

00:58:26.786 --> 00:58:29.066
that on this auspicious occasion,

00:58:29.266 --> 00:58:32.326
we should realize, that, such great powers are with us.

00:58:32.526 --> 00:58:36.936
And why shouldn’t we accept these powers and live like an emperor?

00:58:37.166 --> 00:58:40.976
And why should we be “Petty minded”, when we have such a big throne,

00:58:41.176 --> 00:58:43.466
then let us sit on the throne with dignity.

00:58:43.676 --> 00:58:46.776
And let us live with that dignity, as we are supposed to.

00:58:46.976 --> 00:58:49.726
Now you all are Sahaja Yogis, you are saints,

00:58:49.926 --> 00:58:52.496
it is a very great thing, when were there so many Yogis?

00:58:52.696 --> 00:58:56.096
And so many saints have come to “Ganapatipule”,

00:58:56.376 --> 00:58:59.586
where Maha Ganesha is present, He is called Maha Ganesha.

00:58:59.786 --> 00:59:01.486
And in the Maha Ganesha’s

00:59:05.396 --> 00:59:07.436
family, we all have joined.

00:59:07.786 --> 00:59:10.256
We have come to His land.

00:59:10.606 --> 00:59:16.756
And with His blessings, His great powers can manifest within us as well.

00:59:16.956 --> 00:59:21.696
But first of all, to withstand that power, His purity should be established.

00:59:22.346 --> 00:59:24.836
and there should be devotion (bhakti) like him.

00:59:25.036 --> 00:59:30.736
They way His bhakti is, which has no selfishness of any kind.

00:59:30.976 --> 00:59:32.566
There is only Bhakti.

00:59:32.846 --> 00:59:36.496
If we just become like that, then He takes care of everything else.

00:59:36.696 --> 00:59:38.886
Then He is at your disposal to take care of you.

00:59:39.086 --> 00:59:44.216
But if you go on the opposite side, He may also harm you.

00:59:44.876 --> 00:59:46.326
One such,

00:59:48.736 --> 00:59:51.366
thing of wisdom, I am trying to explain you.

00:59:51.566 --> 00:59:58.056
Because a mother always feels that, These children of mine are very sweet,

00:59:58.486 --> 01:00:01.656
and you should only benefit from Them (deities).

01:00:02.176 --> 01:00:06.536
Then I also fear that They do not hold you up by the ear.

01:00:06.946 --> 01:00:10.096
That is why, I am explaining to you,

01:00:10.446 --> 01:00:13.386
when we have created such beautiful atmosphere here,

01:00:13.596 --> 01:00:17.856
and gathered like one family,

01:00:18.136 --> 01:00:19.766
and we all are together,

01:00:19.966 --> 01:00:25.736
then these elder brothers of yours should be honored by you,

01:00:26.276 --> 01:00:29.816
that they are present and they should be recognized.

01:00:30.066 --> 01:00:34.506
And if you worship them and make them happy, it will be really good.

01:00:34.776 --> 01:00:37.176
But they don’t get pleased so soon.

01:00:37.606 --> 01:00:41.096
Unless you are cleansed from within, they won’t be happy.

01:00:41.296 --> 01:00:45.056
So you clean yourself from within, and take a vow today

01:00:45.256 --> 01:00:49.296
that, in future we will completely discard all types of pettiness,

01:00:49.506 --> 01:00:53.006
frivolous act, and trivial matters.

01:00:53.516 --> 01:00:57.096
And we shall look up to these deities’ greatness and purity

01:00:57.296 --> 01:01:00.686
and consider them as our ideals and steer our lives in that direction.

01:01:00.896 --> 01:01:04.696
If we do just this, we will be tremendously benefitted.

01:01:05.216 --> 01:01:07.186
My infinite blessings to you.

01:01:07.496 --> 01:01:11.386
And you all have come here with lots of love,

01:01:14.516 --> 01:01:17.336
Your Mother can not say thanks to each one of you,

01:01:18.366 --> 01:01:20.856
but know that My heart is full,

01:01:21.056 --> 01:01:23.716
and in this heart, you all are residing,

01:01:24.066 --> 01:01:26.486
and I love you all too much.

01:01:26.696 --> 01:01:30.376
and I look at you with immeasurable love.

01:01:30.636 --> 01:01:34.196
and my thoughts are always around your protection.

01:01:34.396 --> 01:01:38.096
My total attention and thoughts are towards you

01:01:38.556 --> 01:01:43.336
and for any kind of problem you can write to me,

01:01:43.566 --> 01:01:46.066
but you yourself should become pure,

01:01:46.266 --> 01:01:48.536
you yourself become clean,

01:01:48.746 --> 01:01:54.696
and upon becoming auspicious, enjoy this bliss till eternity.
