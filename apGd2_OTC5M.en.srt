1
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:01,230
I’m sorry I had to speak in Hindi language,

2
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:10,360
because most of the people who are here
are understanding Hindi only.

3
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:16,970
When I am abroad, all the time
I am speaking English,

4
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:19,960
nothing else but English language,

5
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:25,780
and then I want to have some change
for a while.

6
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:34,640
Regarding today’s great advent
of Shri Jesus Christ,

7
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:39,740
I told them that He came on this world

8
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:46,440
with a very great mission, I would say
one of the greatest missions,

9
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:53,420
because He wanted to open the Agnya
Chakra

10
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,010
which was so constricted, and could not
be done before.

11
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,680
For that He had to sacrifice His life.

12
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:11,120
By that sacrifice only, the great Agnya
could be opened.

13
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:19,320
He was aware of it. He knew that it has
to happen,

14
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:27,990
that He has to somehow accept this
sacrifice.

15
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:32,150
As it is, He was a divine personality,

16
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:38,910
He had no problem in doing so. But He
thought that

17
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:50,070
could be some other way there, by which
you can open this Agnya Chakra.

18
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:58,270
But He had to sacrifice His life, and
in that sacrifice He has shown

19
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:07,260
that if you have to rise above this
mundane, superficial life,

20
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:15,380
you have to in a way sacrifice.
Sacrifice what?

21
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:22,620
Sacrifice all your six enemies. But
with the Kundalini awakening

22
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,610
all these six enemies completely get
detached.

23
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:36,350
Depends on how your Kundalini has risen.
If she has risen in a perfect manner,

24
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:39,600
then I have seen people at the first shot

25
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:44,560
they just become completely self-realized
people.

26
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,940
Of course there are very few, but there
have been;

27
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:54,430
while I see most of you have little
problems,

28
00:26:54,450 --> 00:27:00,550
and for most of you it is the problem
of the Agnya Chakra.

29
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:05,170
How do we get the Agnya Chakra working
so much is this,

30
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:13,190
that we think as a reaction, as a reaction

31
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:19,100
to anything outside, we react to
everything.

32
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,330
While I see here all these lamps, I can
react by saying,

33
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,660
“From where did they get all these?
How much it must have cost?

34
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:34,470
Where are they kept all the year round?”
- All kinds of things. I can react.

35
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:43,870
This reaction comes from our conditionings,
or from our ego.

36
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:49,870
Egoistical people are extremely sensitive.
If you give them, say,

37
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:54,710
something that they think is not very
dignified, they can feel hurt.

38
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:58,880
They can feel hurt for anything, because
they have a consciousness

39
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:07,090
that they are something special, something
higher people, and one should behave

40
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:12,080
with them when they are dealing with
anyone.

41
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,990
And that’s how they get absolutely
disturbed

42
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:21,740
if they find anybody in any way degrading
them.

43
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:25,070
This comes from ego.

44
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:31,140
Ego is a part and parcel of this Agnya
movement,

45
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,560
and the second one is your conditioning.

46
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:42,120
Now you have a conditioning: say you are
an Indian, now the conditioning is

47
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:49,060
that a person who comes to meet you
should touch your feet, supposing,

48
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,930
that’s your relationship.

49
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:56,540
And the person doesn’t touch your feet,
then you are angry.

50
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,750
Anything like that which is your
conditioning,

51
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:05,230
gives you an idea that you are been
insulted

52
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:12,280
or in any way you have not been
respected, then you feel bad.

53
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,380
The other reactions of ego are like this,

54
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:21,110
as I said: I see those lamps and I can say,
“Why not I have it?”

55
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:24,520
Or if I have them, “Why will I give it
to anyone?”

56
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:29,680
Ego reactions are there, or conditioning
reactions are there.

57
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,510
These two were to be finished, and that
was done

58
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:40,240
by the sacrifice of the life of Christ.
Christ Himself was a divine person,

59
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:48,460
and a divine person is like the sea because
it remains at the zero point,

60
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:53,850
at the lowest point; it does all work
from that point.

61
00:29:53,890 --> 00:30:02,330
It will make clouds, it will make rain,
and when all the rivers are in spate

62
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:09,270
they’ll run into the sea, because the sea
remains at the lower point.

63
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:16,870
So humility is the, one of the criteria
of a Sahaja yoga.

64
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:22,400
A person who doesn’t have humility
cannot be called sahaja yogi.

65
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:26,180
I have seen even sahaja yogis get very
angry,

66
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:30,510
sometimes start shouting and getting angry
and misbehaving.

67
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:35,700
That’s the sign that he is not yet a sahaja
yogi, he has to still mature.

68
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:46,410
So this humility of a person will give you
more stationary, I would say,

69
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:56,020
more permanent state by which you will
not react,

70
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:00,820
you will not react. You look at anything,
you react.

71
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,450
But then you don’t react, you just watch,

72
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,720
and that is how the new state of witness
state comes into you.

73
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:13,380
When you become the witness you are
just watching,

74
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:22,470
just watching; not reacting, not thinking
about it, but you are in the present,

75
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:28,990
and in the present you just watch, watch
and really enjoy it.

76
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:37,450
The enjoyment of all the creation is not
within your mind when you are thinking.

77
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:45,500
And when you are not thinking, the whole
enjoyment of the beauty of all this creation

78
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:51,270
reflects in you, and gives you tremendous
joy and peace.

79
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:56,920
So one has to learn that we should not
react.

80
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:02,510
The today’s problem is, all human beings
are very good at reacting.

81
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:06,900
Reaction is a basic principle of today’s
life.

82
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:12,910
You see any newspaper, you see any book,
you meet anyone,

83
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:18,030
what I find that they are experts
on reacting. They react,

84
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:28,250
and by reaction what happens, they never
achieve any essence of the thing.

85
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:34,740
Essence is only through witness state
that you can achieve.

86
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:42,000
This is what we have to learn from
the crucifixion of Christ,

87
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:49,830
from His birth, that He was born in a very
humble family,

88
00:32:50,070 --> 00:33:00,150
very poor family, in very adverse
conditions.

89
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:06,940
The reason was to show that all these
outward things

90
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:13,170
and all these outward glories do not
make you great.

91
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:18,500
The greatness is within, and when
that greatness is there

92
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:25,440
then you don’t care for anything, because
you are so much enriched within yourself

93
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:32,200
that you don’t bother about other things,
you don’t think about these things,

94
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:37,320
and you live in your own majestic life.

95
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:43,400
This is what we see in His life, He was
a very majestic person.

96
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:48,760
Otherwise if you meet somebody
who is a poor man, say,

97
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:56,820
and who has felt the poverty, he’ll talk
to you with a beggarish style.

98
00:33:56,850 --> 00:34:02,410
If there’s somebody who is born in a rich
family, he will talk to you

99
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:11,010
in a very, I should say, outward, outwardly
showing-off nature.

100
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:18,060
But a person who is a divine person,
all these things don’t touch.

101
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:24,830
For him riches or not riches, positions
or no power

102
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:29,340
is all just the same; and when that
happens,

103
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:35,000
then you should consider that you have
become sahaja yogis.

104
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:41,010
I’ve seen people who come to Ganapatipule
- now they are very much changed.

105
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:46,070
Otherwise in the beginning they used
to say, “We don’t have water,

106
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:53,580
we don’t have this facility, it’s very cold
or hot” - whatever it is.

107
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:59,030
They were all the time talking as if they
are on a holiday.

108
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:02,730
It is something very different.

109
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:08,200
You are here to develop your witness state.

110
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:12,370
Did you see the sky, how beautiful it was,

111
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:17,520
how orange, blue, all kinds of colors
were there.

112
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:26,480
The color it takes automatically,
and is enjoying it. It is not bothered

113
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:32,100
that it should remain forever, that this
will go away when there is darkness.

114
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:37,220
Just watching, the sky is just watching.

115
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:45,870
Whatever comes its way, it takes it. So
it’s so beautiful and it’s so joy-giving.

116
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:57,510
So the another thing is that when you
are in that state of spirituality,

117
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:03,240
then you are joy-giving, you are
peace-giving,

118
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:08,580
you are compassionate, and you love
each other.

119
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:14,200
All these problems of the ego just
disappear.

120
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:18,630
Ego is your greatest enemy, I think,

121
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:28,460
and it is the one that really hinders
all the wealth and beauty of your life.

122
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:37,540
So if you could just see this ego, how it
works, just you’ll be enjoying it.

123
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:41,780
It’s a drama it plays - all right,
let’s have it!

124
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:46,330
You can see the drama and then suddenly
you will be amazed

125
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:50,200
that you are not in it, you are
watching it.

126
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:59,040
When you are detached from your ego,
you can see how it tries to entice you.

127
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:05,520
These are the problems of today, and
that’s why we need Jesus very much.

128
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:11,180
The problem of today is that people
don’t understand

129
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:16,950
that how much harm they are doing
to themselves, to others,

130
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:22,410
and to the whole world by becoming
egoistical.

131
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:27,390
If they could understand, I tell you,
they would give up.

132
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:35,150
But the problem is they enjoy their hatred
they enjoy that kind of meanness

133
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:41,340
or I would say, very low-level living.
While you are all sahaja yogis,

134
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:48,010
and what you have to do is to understand,
“Why this ego is coming in my head?

135
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,630
What have I done? Who am I?”

136
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:56,540
Once you go on asking such questions
this ego will disappear.

137
00:37:56,570 --> 00:38:02,520
And it’s a big problem for Me also to deal
with people who have ego,

138
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:07,500
because I can’t tell them “You have got
ego.” If I tell them, they’ll all run away.

139
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:12,060
If I tell them, “All right, you are very
good, you are very nice,”

140
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:18,330
then ego will be bloated. Then they’ll say,
“Oh, Mother told us I’m very nice.”

141
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:24,730
It’s very problematic. I don’t know how
to deal with the ego of human beings.

142
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:28,970
I know they have, but I don’t know how
to deal with it.

143
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,790
I think it’s only you can deal with it, if
you will understand what’s wrong with you.

144
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:41,100
That’s a very good way of solving your
problem, and My problem also.

145
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,580
My vision is too great, I think,
for one life.

146
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:49,250
I want a global realization, I want people
all over the world

147
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:55,360
to have realization. It’s very
remarkable how ....

148
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:26,250
In Sahaj culture we have a proper training
for getting rid of ego.

149
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:34,400
You can yourself introspect yourself.

150
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:42,290
You can yourself see why you behave
like this.

151
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:48,880
The introspection that sahaja yogis can
do cannot be done by other people,

152
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:53,970
because they can enter into themselves,
they can see for themselves,

153
00:39:53,990 --> 00:40:01,560
they can watch others. And with that
they can just try to see

154
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:07,340
what is this Mr Ego doing within
your head.

155
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:12,980
Of course, we know that the mantra
of Christ is the best

156
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:19,750
for removing all egoistical problems,
and that helps a lot.

157
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:24,710
But also when you are doing this mantra,
you should be yourself

158
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:31,720
in a very humble state. “What am I,
after all, who am I?

159
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:38,680
Look at so many stars, look at so many
beautiful things, and who am I?

160
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:43,390
What have I done? Why should I be
so egoistical?

161
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:46,480
Why should I think I’m something great?”

162
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:52,410
And also other people pamper you, because
they want to take advantage of you.

163
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,780
So they’ll pamper you, they’ll say “This is
very great, you are very great”;

164
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,270
and you just get enamored, get lost.

165
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:08,920
You are like thrown into the torrential
rain

166
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:17,120
and you flood out into big, I think, like
a big stream of egoistical people.

167
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:22,140
And if you see around today in these
modern times,

168
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:28,800
everybody is quite conscious of their ego,
very conscious,

169
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:33,250
and the way they are coming up
in the newspapers

170
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:38,650
or the way they are in some magazines,
I’m quite amazed.

171
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:43,700
I would feel shy to be there, because
it’s so much

172
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:52,150
of expression of your ego, nothing else.
All kinds of things they start,

173
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:55,750
they have competitions of ego,
lots of competitions.

174
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:02,060
Like they have a beauty competition, then
they have another competition

175
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:08,840
for Mister, you can say India, Mister this
thing, that.

176
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:14,500
All these things actually give the person
ego,

177
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,910
and others also run after such
competitions.

178
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:22,280
They think, “Why am I not? I should be
like that.”

179
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:27,240
So it’s very deadening and absolutely
blinds your mind,

180
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:32,960
that you think this is the way one has
to be very successful.

181
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:38,670
This success lasts for how long?
It perishes in no time.

182
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:44,170
But success in Sahaja Yoga is what will
last forever,

183
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:48,630
and everybody will remember it.

184
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:55,220
The one who has this kind of a humble
nature

185
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:59,530
will be remembered for generations.

186
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:08,150
I’ve never seen a statue of a person
who has been egoistical.

187
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:11,990
On the contrary, if there was some
they used to criticize,

188
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:17,340
“He was a very egoistical man.”
And nowadays it’s impossible,

189
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,730
anybody who has ego, I don’t think
anybody

190
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:24,520
is going to sing any songs about
such a person

191
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:28,450
or going to raise any statues in their
name.

192
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:34,380
So in the heart of hearts we like humble
people,

193
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:40,770
and if we want others to like us, we should
be also very humble.

194
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:45,030
Not artificially, but really,
by understanding

195
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:47,740
that: “What are we? Why should we
proud,

196
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:53,870
why should we try to overpower others
and trouble others?”.

197
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:58,260
If you understand that, you have done
full justification

198
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:02,730
to the incarnation of Jesus Christ
the great.

199
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:08,220
And there are so many qualities He has
shown. But the, for us the best is

200
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:16,750
His passing through the ego sacrificing
His life is the greatest message,

201
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,740
and for that we have to understand.

202
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:24,780
But those who call themselves are
the most egoistical. I was surprised

203
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,210
that England, English people are
extremely egoistical.

204
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:34,600
Or otherwise other countries also I’ve seen
in the West, they are very egoistical.

205
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:38,190
They’ve no humility at all, compared
to Indians,

206
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:43,860
they are very, very egoistical people.
Why? Because they are following Christ,

207
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:48,200
can you imagine! Is this the way
we follow Christ?

208
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:53,090
Those who call themselves Christians
and those who call themselves

209
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:57,280
very great admirers of Christ should
show in their life

210
00:44:57,310 --> 00:45:03,540
that humility, that compassion, that love.
It is not so.

211
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:07,890
So specially for people who are from
Western countries,

212
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:10,940
you must try to learn Sahaj culture.

213
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,610
In the Sahaj culture, how do we talk,
how do we live,

214
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:22,360
how do we contact, is something very
different. And then once you start

215
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:28,810
Sahaj culture in your life, you’ll be
amazed, others will be amazed

216
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:33,250
how you are having a rapport
with each other,

217
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:38,480
how you are looking after everything
so well.

218
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:42,900
This is the best way to live in this world
as sahaja yogis,

219
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:47,460
where there is no ego, there is
no conditioning, nothing.

220
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:55,750
You are just absolutely free from all
these horrible attributes.

221
00:45:55,780 --> 00:46:03,010
And then you will be amazed how people
will trust you, how they will like you.

222
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:08,400
I wish you all a very Happy Christmas.

223
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:20,620
And also remember the message of Christ
and His life.

224
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,650
May God bless you.
