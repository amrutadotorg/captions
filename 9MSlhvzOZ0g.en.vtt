00:02:56.977 --> 00:02:59.907
Please be seated.

00:03:30.422 --> 00:03:35.935
Today I will tell you the importance
of puja.

00:03:39.132 --> 00:03:42.539
[To the Spanish translator: “You could
take this” (microphone).]

00:03:56.708 --> 00:04:08.396
Even among the early Christians,
they used to do the puja

00:04:08.597 --> 00:04:21.397
of the adoration to the statues, maybe,

00:04:21.598 --> 00:04:32.301
or maybe the photographs, or, we can say,
the stained glass copies

00:04:32.502 --> 00:04:36.277
of the Mother and Christ.

00:04:51.692 --> 00:04:56.922
But later on, people started becoming
more rational

00:04:57.123 --> 00:05:03.488
and they did not understand what is
the importance of puja.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.080
And when they could not explain it,

00:05:14.281 --> 00:05:22.040
they gave up doing pujas in that regular
manner.

00:05:32.005 --> 00:05:35.204
Even before Christ, they used to have

00:05:35.405 --> 00:05:39.788
a particular type of a tabernacle, which
was measured

00:05:39.989 --> 00:05:46.979
and was specially made and a puja place
was created to worship –

00:06:01.597 --> 00:06:08.740
to worship what they call Yahovah.

00:06:13.834 --> 00:06:20.728
Now this Yahovah in our Sahaja Yoga
is Sadashiva,

00:06:27.577 --> 00:06:33.552
and Mother Mary is Mahalakshmi.

00:06:35.576 --> 00:06:40.305
She incarnated before also.

00:06:42.165 --> 00:06:46.923
She incarnated as Sita,

00:06:48.434 --> 00:06:54.422
and then She incarnated as Radha,

00:06:54.741 --> 00:07:00.049
and then She incarnated as Mother Mary.

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:05.337
Now it is clearly written about the birth
of Christ

00:07:05.538 --> 00:07:10.663
in a book called Devi Mahatmyam.

00:07:18.997 --> 00:07:24.606
He was the son of Radha.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.890
Radha is the Mahalakshmi,

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:42.666
so He was born in another state, as an egg,

00:07:45.598 --> 00:07:50.149
and half of the egg remained
as Shri Ganesha

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:59.405
and half of it became Mahavishnu,
which is our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:08:08.925 --> 00:08:13.053
All the description about Jesus Christ

00:08:13.254 --> 00:08:20.769
is given in that Mahavishnu’s description,
exactly the same.

00:08:29.767 --> 00:08:37.283
Now this Mahalakshmi came on this earth
and She brought forth Her child

00:08:37.484 --> 00:08:39.896
with immaculate conception,

00:08:40.105 --> 00:08:46.190
which She had done before also, as Radha.

00:09:02.013 --> 00:09:12.751
So, the Christ is the son of the great
being of the Virat.

00:09:18.843 --> 00:09:25.808
Actually Vishnu, Mahavishnu, Vishnu
becomes the Virata.

00:09:34.906 --> 00:09:38.975
Now this Vishnu Tattwa becomes Virata

00:09:39.176 --> 00:09:45.088
and also He becomes Rama and Krishna

00:09:53.533 --> 00:09:58.212
and then the Virat, means the Akbar.

00:10:01.946 --> 00:10:14.041
So Christ is the Omkara itself,
is the vibrations itself.

00:10:20.526 --> 00:10:29.546
All other incarnations had to take
the principle

00:10:29.747 --> 00:10:34.571
or the essence of the Mother Earth
to create their body,

00:10:34.772 --> 00:10:40.989
except for Christ’s body, which is
absolutely Omkara.

00:10:55.846 --> 00:11:03.339
And the earth element of that being
is Shri Ganesha.

00:11:10.356 --> 00:11:19.244
So we can say that Christ is the power
of Shri Ganesha which incarnated.

00:11:25.323 --> 00:11:32.718
So He – that’s the reason He could walk
on the water.

00:11:36.299 --> 00:11:42.148
So He is the purest form of Divinity,

00:11:43.839 --> 00:11:48.448
because He is just vibrations.

00:11:51.263 --> 00:11:59.087
So when you do puja to Me,

00:11:59.288 --> 00:12:05.612
because I’m in person, there is nothing
unreal.

00:12:16.648 --> 00:12:20.204
If they had done puja to Christ -

00:12:20.405 --> 00:12:28.118
they must, they have done puja to Christ
also when He lived and to His Mother.

00:12:34.738 --> 00:12:42.530
It is said that in the Ten Commandments
whatever is created by the heavens

00:12:42.731 --> 00:12:51.954
and by the earth should not be re-created
and re-produced and worshipped.

00:13:01.513 --> 00:13:07.675
So the incarnations are created
by the heavens.

00:13:14.159 --> 00:13:22.905
Only in modern times it is possible to take
a photograph of the incarnation.

00:13:31.362 --> 00:13:36.324
But in the former days there was
no possibility.

00:13:40.585 --> 00:13:46.038
Now whatever is created by the Mother Earth

00:13:46.239 --> 00:13:51.490
is what has come out of the Mother Earth,

00:13:55.767 --> 00:13:59.269
which is the swayambhu,

00:14:00.121 --> 00:14:03.925
is created by the Mother Earth.

00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:11.385
Now we have everywhere, we find
the swayambhu things.

00:14:17.069 --> 00:14:24.281
Another thing is, some realised souls also
have made beautiful statues.

00:14:32.577 --> 00:14:41.146
I went to Portugal and they had a festival
of the Lady of the Rocks.

00:14:46.242 --> 00:14:51.769
So I went to see that place

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:59.546
and there was a very small little statue
of this dimension, height of the Mary,

00:14:59.747 --> 00:15:04.243
about say, five inches, at the most.

00:15:11.026 --> 00:15:15.206
And the face was just like Mine,

00:15:16.904 --> 00:15:20.314
exactly like Mine.

00:15:20.515 --> 00:15:27.544
And they said that this was found suddenly
by two children

00:15:27.745 --> 00:15:36.333
who were following a rabbit which hid
inside a niche.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.874
So these children saw some light
inside the niche

00:15:51.075 --> 00:15:56.854
and they started following under a rock,

00:16:01.662 --> 00:16:08.365
and they reached the source of the light,
was this statue. They brought it out.

00:16:12.548 --> 00:16:14.394
And in that light they walked,

00:16:14.595 --> 00:16:17.780
and when the people outside, were lots
of people were gathered,

00:16:17.981 --> 00:16:23.954
they were amazed to see that they brought
out the statue from somewhere inside.

00:16:36.465 --> 00:16:42.863
So they worship that statue in that place.

00:16:46.505 --> 00:16:52.508
Now, these statues give you vibrations,

00:16:56.649 --> 00:17:00.467
as I give you vibrations,

00:17:00.668 --> 00:17:04.060
but not so much

00:17:04.473 --> 00:17:07.628
as I give you.

00:17:08.303 --> 00:17:11.846
And all the other statues also, there
may be many,

00:17:12.047 --> 00:17:15.986
who might be giving you vibrations.

00:17:19.452 --> 00:17:23.620
Also in India, as you know, you went
some of you to Ganapatipule,

00:17:23.821 --> 00:17:27.377
where it is the Ganesha which has come -
Mahaganesha, that is Christ -

00:17:27.578 --> 00:17:32.025
has come out of the Mother Earth,
Mahaganesha.

00:17:42.339 --> 00:17:45.534
So the lower portion of the body
you see there,

00:17:45.735 --> 00:17:50.412
and the head is the whole of the mountain.

00:17:58.423 --> 00:18:05.523
And there the water of the sea is
also sweet,

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:16.590
and there are many sweet water wells there.

00:18:19.055 --> 00:18:22.325
If you remember, a photograph of Mine
was taken there,

00:18:22.526 --> 00:18:26.100
many people took photograph.

00:18:29.939 --> 00:18:36.166
And in some photographs, in My heart
there’s a light coming out.

00:18:38.319 --> 00:18:43.527
And some told Me that some photographs
which did not have the light,

00:18:43.728 --> 00:18:53.520
but when they re-took, I mean the negatives
were again taken as a photograph,

00:18:53.742 --> 00:18:59.324
and again they took a photograph with that,
then the light came in there.

00:19:12.756 --> 00:19:17.773
So, one must know that in the realm
of Divine

00:19:17.974 --> 00:19:22.938
there are all kinds of miraculous things.

00:19:32.372 --> 00:19:35.825
Same is the puja.

00:19:36.166 --> 00:19:43.523
Now when we do the puja, first of all
you will praise Shri Ganesha.

00:19:46.731 --> 00:19:54.933
By that, in you, Shri Ganesha will be
awakened and established.

00:20:01.582 --> 00:20:08.319
By worshipping Me as Shri Ganesha,
your innocence will be established.

00:20:16.377 --> 00:20:18.911
And you will see, the vibration-wise also,

00:20:19.112 --> 00:20:28.020
your vibrations will increase and you will
feel very stable within yourself.

00:20:35.461 --> 00:20:43.856
Now when you will take Shri Ganesha’s
names you will know what qualities He has,

00:20:47.756 --> 00:20:51.515
what powers He gives you.

00:20:52.114 --> 00:20:54.331
When you praise those qualities,

00:20:54.532 --> 00:21:01.408
those powers of those qualities will
start emitting through you.

00:21:12.118 --> 00:21:15.875
This is how the Divine works,

00:21:17.658 --> 00:21:22.740
as if you get charged with those qualities.

00:21:26.747 --> 00:21:33.051
Then you praise the Goddess, the Adi
Shakti.

00:21:36.915 --> 00:21:44.555
Now the Adi Shakti has all the seven
chakras within Her awakened,

00:21:49.525 --> 00:21:53.349
and She has to work with all these seven
chakras.

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:58.648
For the first time such an incarnation
has come.

00:22:03.697 --> 00:22:06.362
It’s like you make first one room, then
second room,

00:22:06.562 --> 00:22:09.921
then third room, seven rooms, and then
the whole house is done,

00:22:10.122 --> 00:22:14.492
you get the keys and you open, the house
is yours.

00:22:28.163 --> 00:22:35.515
That is how I could achieve Self-
realisation en masse.

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:49.806
It could not happen earlier,

00:22:51.714 --> 00:22:59.548
but now possible, because of this
combination of all the seven chakras.

00:23:05.653 --> 00:23:11.505
So now when you are praising the Adi
Shakti, I’m also a Mahamaya,

00:23:11.706 --> 00:23:14.667
that I look like you, I behave like you,

00:23:14.868 --> 00:23:16.754
I have made Myself exactly like you -

00:23:16.955 --> 00:23:21.071
very difficult to make, but I have.

00:23:42.421 --> 00:23:46.431
And this body has to bear lots of things

00:23:46.632 --> 00:23:56.369
to make you understand Sahaja Yoga
and your own powers.

00:24:07.146 --> 00:24:10.495
For example, you are - if you are rude
to Me,

00:24:10.696 --> 00:24:14.474
if you are not respectful, Christ gets
very angry

00:24:14.675 --> 00:24:18.711
because He has said that anything against
Holy Ghost, He won’t tolerate.

00:24:18.912 --> 00:24:24.239
So the My chakra, the Agnya starts,
you see, throwing anger,

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:27.879
and moving very fast.

00:24:40.594 --> 00:24:44.728
Now I have to bear it.

00:24:44.929 --> 00:24:50.038
I cannot tell you the way Christ wants
Me to tell you.

00:24:56.824 --> 00:25:02.663
Because He is very direct,

00:25:04.991 --> 00:25:11.560
and I have to little bit be careful so that
you don’t get upset.

00:25:18.722 --> 00:25:23.913
Moreover, while doing the puja, supposing
you are a doubting type,

00:25:24.114 --> 00:25:32.168
or you are opposing it, then you don’t
absorb the vibrations and I have problems,

00:25:46.385 --> 00:25:50.683
because the vibrations are flowing and
you are not receiving it.

00:25:50.892 --> 00:25:55.390
So I don’t know how to contain within
Myself if you don’t suck in the vibrations,

00:25:55.606 --> 00:26:00.041
so I take time to take them out.

00:26:15.709 --> 00:26:18.137
So all these things are very symbolic,

00:26:18.338 --> 00:26:23.350
whatever we are doing is very symbolic.

00:26:28.928 --> 00:26:34.361
And that symbol actually acts.

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:40.637
For example if you give somebody a flower,

00:26:40.838 --> 00:26:45.644
that fellow feels, that person feels
extremely joyous and happy,

00:26:45.845 --> 00:26:50.298
and gratitude comes in.

00:26:58.679 --> 00:27:04.117
So when you offer Me say, flowers
or anything like water or anything,

00:27:04.318 --> 00:27:12.610
then the elements are happy and the deities
are happy in the chakras.

00:27:25.015 --> 00:27:29.495
And then they emit their vibrations
of their quality

00:27:29.696 --> 00:27:32.708
and of their blessings on you.

00:27:32.909 --> 00:27:37.715
They give you their quality and their
blessings.

00:27:46.509 --> 00:27:50.546
That is how the Divine acts.

00:27:53.773 --> 00:28:02.606
And gradually after puja you will feel it,
that the whole thing is working out.

00:28:07.487 --> 00:28:09.954
Now we are doing puja at this time,

00:28:10.155 --> 00:28:14.234
and all over the world people know
that there’s a puja going on here,

00:28:14.435 --> 00:28:21.778
so they are also sitting in meditation and
they also get the blessings.

00:28:36.432 --> 00:28:40.280
They are also waiting for this moment
when the puja starts.

00:28:40.481 --> 00:28:43.175
So we give them a time like eleven
o’clock or so,

00:28:43.376 --> 00:28:48.448
up to eleven o’clock we should sit down
and they start at eleven o’clock.

00:28:48.649 --> 00:28:51.658
Now they are getting the same blessings,

00:28:51.859 --> 00:28:53.605
though you are doing the puja

00:28:53.806 --> 00:28:58.585
but they also get the blessings in their
meditation.

00:29:16.458 --> 00:29:24.446
If you are not yet so clever and if you
don’t know all the few things

00:29:24.647 --> 00:29:28.030
which are important in the puja, does
not matter.

00:29:28.231 --> 00:29:32.554
Because if you are ignorant about it,
innocent about it,

00:29:32.755 --> 00:29:37.699
God knows, He forgives, He doesn’t mind.

00:29:56.548 --> 00:29:59.991
You should not mind if you commit any
mistakes or anything:

00:30:00.192 --> 00:30:05.784
just with a humble heart, do the way
you like.

00:30:14.747 --> 00:30:17.986
Gradually, you will learn.
But if you know

00:30:18.187 --> 00:30:23.700
and then you deliberately make mistakes,
then it’s not good.

00:30:35.176 --> 00:30:42.648
As we forgive our children, God also
forgives innocent children.

00:30:48.606 --> 00:30:52.937
So you should be very relaxed about it.

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:58.991
And just do it for the joy of your heart.

00:31:01.024 --> 00:31:04.067
May God bless you all.

00:31:08.309 --> 00:31:12.400
[I think – he finds it difficult to sit
in the lap.

00:31:12.601 --> 00:31:15.526
He can sit at the back if he likes,
this gentleman.

00:31:15.727 --> 00:31:18.971
This little boy is too much for him to sit
like [that] –

00:31:19.172 --> 00:31:21.104
you can sit comfortably, be comfortable,

00:31:21.305 --> 00:31:24.693
there’s nothing to feel bad.]

00:31:26.062 --> 00:31:29.976
Now, they have to wash the Feet.

00:31:33.236 --> 00:31:35.012
The children have to wash the Feet

00:31:35.213 --> 00:31:39.730
and we’ll be singing that time the praise
of Shri Ganesha.

00:31:39.931 --> 00:31:42.193
Yogi: Yes. In Spanish, Mother?
Shri Mataji: In Spanish.

00:31:42.394 --> 00:31:45.531
Yogi Yes.
Yogi 2: OK. Pujari?

00:31:45.732 --> 00:31:48.500
Shri Mataji: Now see the description
of Shri Ganesha

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:51.375
which was written thousands of years back.

00:31:51.576 --> 00:31:56.633
It’s translated and exactly the same
of that of Christ.

00:31:56.834 --> 00:32:03.922
We have little added to it about Christ
in the end, but it’s the same.

00:32:16.224 --> 00:32:20.101
First the boys must wash and the girls
must paint.

00:32:20.302 --> 00:32:23.260
Yogi: OK.

00:32:25.677 --> 00:32:28.753
Shri Mataji: So she – they are unmarried
girls.

00:32:28.954 --> 00:32:35.601
Unmarried women and unmarried girls
should do it, paint.

00:32:35.802 --> 00:32:39.436
First let them wash. First let the boys
wash –

00:32:39.637 --> 00:32:42.504
just tell, first let the boys wash,

00:32:42.705 --> 00:32:48.319
and then the unmarried women, unmarried
girls should paint,

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:51.381
and then the married women should give
the ornaments.

00:32:51.582 --> 00:32:53.492
Now, can you bring it from the… Warren:
She is going to help with the washing,

00:32:53.692 --> 00:32:55.840
for children to wash.
Shri Mataji: All right.

00:32:56.041 --> 00:32:59.982
So now, can you get the ornaments also?

00:33:19.408 --> 00:33:23.778
So first of all you get the water together,

00:33:23.978 --> 00:33:27.984
now this one [container of water from Feet]
is to be brought here.

00:33:32.508 --> 00:33:36.056
Yes. Can I have this kumkum?

00:33:36.257 --> 00:33:40.194
Swastika should be made on that. Swastika
should be made.

00:33:40.395 --> 00:33:44.328
Then other things also, My necklaces-
and all that.

00:33:44.529 --> 00:33:49.629
No, no, the bangles are – and necklaces
I gave you

00:33:56.106 --> 00:33:58.675
Yes.

00:34:06.829 --> 00:34:11.979
Just correct, correct, correct. It’s
the other way round it is. Yes.

00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:15.545
No, it’s not that.

00:34:18.748 --> 00:34:22.984
Once this is made, just take it to go
through.

00:34:27.126 --> 00:34:31.366
Yogini: Excuse me.
Shri Mataji: You take a cloth.

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:38.579
And bangles are there?
Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:42.887
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, it goes like that.

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:49.751
Just if you can wipe it, it’s all right.

00:34:50.992 --> 00:34:55.359
You can just yes, wipe it, I’ll tell you.

00:35:09.964 --> 00:35:12.536
All right.

00:35:28.144 --> 00:35:34.568
This was the correct swastika. And
the other way is the Hitler’s swastika.

00:35:34.769 --> 00:35:38.227
Can I have the towel? I’ll have the towel.

00:35:38.428 --> 00:35:41.207
[Warren: “Yes”.
Yogi: “It’s the same, Mother”

00:35:41.408 --> 00:35:47.210
Warren (aside): “Did she respect the form?”.
Yogi: “It is the same”.]

00:35:47.488 --> 00:35:48.946
You may keep it in a plate.

00:35:49.155 --> 00:35:53.845
Warren: Yes, I’m just going to get it,
Mother, I’ll get another plate.

00:35:54.046 --> 00:35:56.725
Shri Mataji: And the bangles?
Warren: Yes.

00:35:56.926 --> 00:36:01.349
Shri Mataji: Just give Me that, Albert.

00:36:06.006 --> 00:36:09.385
What is it, are you giving these bangles?
Warren: Done the same that the…

00:36:09.586 --> 00:36:12.432
Shri Mataji: What’s it?
Warren: Yes, done the same

00:36:12.633 --> 00:36:15.597
that the swastika is the same, is the one
that was used by Hitler,

00:36:15.808 --> 00:36:18.220
he just turned it on the side.
Shri Mataji: No, no.

00:36:18.421 --> 00:36:22.557
You see, what happened in the beginning
he was using the other way round.

00:36:22.758 --> 00:36:25.911
Then what happened, they used – that’s
your Mother’s trick –

00:36:26.112 --> 00:36:28.842
they used the stencil in the other way
round,

00:36:29.043 --> 00:36:34.903
so the thing, swastika, turned round and
they lost. You don’t know this?

00:36:35.104 --> 00:36:39.788
To begin with, they started an upside-down
thing, you see, the other one,

00:36:39.989 --> 00:36:43.349
to begin with. They started using the other
way.

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:47.576
But then the stencil was used in the other
way round. You see?

00:36:47.777 --> 00:36:52.772
You know, the whole thing turned and
they kept to this.

00:36:52.973 --> 00:36:57.867
That’s how they lost. You don’t know this?

00:36:58.068 --> 00:37:03.607
Yogi: No. Shri Mataji: Just tell her, this
is the trick I’ve played.

00:37:03.813 --> 00:37:06.419
[Yogi: “They’d made the stencil the wrong
way”]

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:09.702
You see, the other way, they used
the stencil.

00:37:09.903 --> 00:37:11.081
[Yogi: “Yes. And so it came out this way”]

00:37:11.282 --> 00:37:14.091
You see, first they started using
the stencil on one side,

00:37:14.292 --> 00:37:19.183
and then they started using it the other
side, and that’s how they lost.

00:37:19.395 --> 00:37:22.392
Yogi: And it came out this way.
Shri Mataji: No,no, if you make a stencil

00:37:22.593 --> 00:37:27.881
like this, you see, first the other way
round it was, you see,

00:37:28.082 --> 00:37:31.505
and then if you turn it the other way
round, then you come this way,

00:37:31.706 --> 00:37:33.715
it came this way. Yogi: Yes. It was on
the flags at the start this way, Mother.

00:37:33.916 --> 00:37:36.104
Shri Mataji: No, this is the second
swastika.

00:37:36.305 --> 00:37:41.435
The first swastika was the other way round.

00:37:42.531 --> 00:37:45.289
That’s how they got it.

00:37:46.917 --> 00:37:50.507
They used the stencils, you see, to make
the swastika first.

00:37:50.708 --> 00:37:52.479
So first one was the other way round.

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:57.014
But then the stencils were spoiled or maybe
whatever it is, so they turned it round.

00:37:57.215 --> 00:38:02.535
When they turned it round this swastika
started coming, they didn’t know.

00:38:06.564 --> 00:38:11.848
One stands for destruction, another stands
for construction.

00:38:12.619 --> 00:38:16.730
Explain to them, so they’ll understand.
All right.

00:38:36.294 --> 00:38:38.778
You follow the point?
[Yogi: “Yes, Shri Mataji”]

00:38:38.979 --> 00:38:42.463
That’s how they lost.

00:39:05.316 --> 00:39:10.441
They took their advice to begin with from
the lamas,

00:39:10.642 --> 00:39:14.525
and lamas told them to use the swastika
the other way round.

00:39:14.726 --> 00:39:19.666
But then the mistake was that they drew
for them,

00:39:19.867 --> 00:39:23.669
and then they turned the stencil, they
didn’t realize

00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:28.931
that they have turned the stencil, so it is
coming the other way round.

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:33.657
They were their gurus.

00:39:42.808 --> 00:39:46.522
So it’s all right, doesn’t matter, as long
as we know how to do it, that’s all.

00:39:46.723 --> 00:39:49.974
Nothing to worry.

00:39:54.641 --> 00:39:57.713
Yogi: It’s time to wash Your feet now,
Mother?

00:39:57.914 --> 00:40:02.187
Shri Mataji: Now you have to wash My feet,
the children have to.

00:40:03.671 --> 00:40:07.001
(Aside to a Sahaja Yogini: “Be careful”).

00:40:27.007 --> 00:40:30.876
Just to pour water, that’s all.

00:40:34.011 --> 00:40:35.985
Next time also remember

00:40:36.186 --> 00:40:41.433
we’ll have to give them the pots for this,
for washing My Feet, all right?

00:40:41.634 --> 00:40:48.152
For them. Warren? They haven’t got them.
Yogi: Yes, Mother, I’ve noted that.

00:40:49.907 --> 00:40:54.016
Shri Mataji: Rub it with both the hands.

00:40:55.263 --> 00:40:59.096
All right, this and this. Yes.

00:41:02.267 --> 00:41:06.895
Two persons can do at a time, two of you
would be [better].

00:41:07.475 --> 00:41:10.071
Will be better. Two, two, ha. Now you
two do it.

00:41:10.272 --> 00:41:15.160
With both the hands. With both the hands.

00:41:15.361 --> 00:41:19.113
Tell them to do it with both the hands.

00:41:22.257 --> 00:41:25.405
Use this hand also.

00:41:26.057 --> 00:41:30.457
[A yogi starts talking in Spanish about
the qualities of Shri Ganesha]

00:41:38.873 --> 00:41:43.716
Shri Mataji: Loudly, I should hear.

00:41:57.829 --> 00:42:00.794
Shri Mataji: Let Javier otherwise read it.
If he wants.

00:42:00.995 --> 00:42:03.781
Javier, you can read it. His voice is
not too low.

00:42:03.982 --> 00:42:07.913
All right so? Everybody should hear what
he is saying.

00:42:08.114 --> 00:42:10.933
Or read it…

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:15.900
(To the children) Yes, good now, you do it.
Now.

00:42:16.101 --> 00:42:19.387
Let them, both of them.

00:42:35.893 --> 00:42:38.558
Good.

00:42:42.741 --> 00:42:47.482
All right, good. Let them do it.

00:44:03.941 --> 00:44:06.171
Yes, yes.

00:44:06.374 --> 00:44:11.524
Give Me a towel, towel. Towel.

00:44:28.656 --> 00:44:32.673
Wipe it. Yes, you do it.

00:44:37.999 --> 00:44:41.509
Yes. With force.

00:46:33.878 --> 00:46:39.689
Javier (In Spanish from the prayer):
Tu eres Brahman, Vishnu, Rudra…

00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:43.870
Shri Mataji: The essence. Essence
of Brahma, Vishnu –

00:46:44.071 --> 00:46:50.124
Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, Rudra is,
is Shri Ganesha.

00:46:50.325 --> 00:46:53.960
The essence, the power. Is Christ.

00:46:55.722 --> 00:47:01.904
Essence. Jesus.

00:47:03.592 --> 00:47:06.993
Javier (In Spanish from the prayer):
… Tu eres Indra, Agni…

00:47:07.194 --> 00:47:15.616
Shri Mataji: Indra is the God of… the king
of the Gods, all the Gods.

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:21.421
Agni is fire.

00:47:23.136 --> 00:47:26.704
Javier: … Vayu… Shri Mataji: Vayu is air.
All the five elements,

00:47:26.905 --> 00:47:30.208
this means all the five elements.

00:47:31.597 --> 00:47:36.681
Vayu means air, but with the Agni, Vayu…

00:47:36.888 --> 00:47:43.431
Javier: Indra, Vayu… Tu eres el sol,
the sun and the moon.

00:48:27.629 --> 00:48:34.409
Shri Mataji: One minute. You come along –
those who are not yet married ladies.

00:48:37.243 --> 00:48:40.671
And the boys can go back.

00:48:54.742 --> 00:48:59.276
Come. All unmarried?

00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:13.383
Put a little water. All right.

00:49:15.662 --> 00:49:18.649
More water,

00:49:44.282 --> 00:49:48.631
little more water. Little.

00:52:49.294 --> 00:52:52.136
You take out the…

00:54:34.675 --> 00:54:37.754
Be careful.

00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:09.885
May God bless you.

00:55:10.532 --> 00:55:14.374
Now. If we start the… [Yogi: “108 names
of the Devi?”] –

00:55:14.575 --> 00:55:20.808
Eh? We can just start the Devi stotra

00:55:21.009 --> 00:55:23.847
is all right, because they have started
with the Devi.

00:55:24.048 --> 00:55:26.874
Yogi: The 108 names or…

00:55:38.835 --> 00:55:42.283
Shri Mataji: This side also. Here.

00:55:53.727 --> 00:55:59.468
Only now - married women have to come
after this.

00:56:08.743 --> 00:56:17.346
Just you say one name, you say: “Shri
Mata”, then you say the translation.

00:56:30.699 --> 00:56:32.067
Now you must verify,

00:56:32.268 --> 00:56:35.914
you see, these are the qualities they are
describing of your Mother.

00:56:36.115 --> 00:56:41.299
Now you try to, try to verify it also.

00:56:43.143 --> 00:56:48.266
And these names were written also thousands
of years back.

00:56:53.305 --> 00:56:59.506
These are thousand names, we have chosen
only 108.

01:03:32.487 --> 01:03:36.911
Again, again.

01:04:04.969 --> 01:04:08.632
Yogi: Nishkàla. Javier: (translates into
Spanish) Indivisible, completa.

01:04:08.833 --> 01:04:12.652
Shri Mataji: Nìsh-kalà (She corrects
the accents). Yogi: Nìsh-kalà.

01:04:22.619 --> 01:04:26.876
Shri Mataji: (To one of the ladies)
Complete.

01:04:32.035 --> 01:04:37.445
Full. Complete toe.

01:05:34.665 --> 01:05:41.023
Now. The married ladies now.

01:05:43.101 --> 01:05:47.858
Now the married ladies come in – then you
can start it.

01:06:28.956 --> 01:06:33.140
Bangles, did you take bangles?

01:07:00.331 --> 01:07:04.499
There are no bangles as such. Sorry.
It’s all right.

01:07:24.021 --> 01:07:30.121
Doesn’t matter. Good. All right. Give it
away.

01:08:14.147 --> 01:08:17.567
Yes, yes, now. Yes, yes. Yes. Good.

01:08:33.445 --> 01:08:35.532
Yogi: Nirmama.
Javier: No es egoista.

01:08:35.733 --> 01:08:42.870
Shri Mataji: Nirdwanda. Nirdwanda.
Yogi: Nirdwanda.

01:10:06.097 --> 01:10:08.678
Shri Mataji: Mirror you [can have]. Mirror.

01:10:08.879 --> 01:10:12.140
Mirror you can have.

01:10:25.363 --> 01:10:28.363
Family.
[Yogini: “Yes”]

(To the young boy bringing the Mangala
Sutra) Hold it.

01:11:23.003 --> 01:11:26.816
He’s very nice. It’s correct, now, it’s
correct, that’s right.

01:11:27.017 --> 01:11:31.994
Should be in this way.

01:11:34.561 --> 01:11:37.315
Thank you.

01:12:17.005 --> 01:12:21.125
(Aside to the lady who is putting the
anklet) Other way round, other way.

01:13:49.882 --> 01:13:54.764
Warren? They are missing here all
the (toe rings)

01:13:56.625 --> 01:14:02.266
for other toes. All they were there
in France.

01:14:02.467 --> 01:14:05.025
Warren: They were in France, Mother, but
they went back to London…

01:14:05.226 --> 01:14:08.225
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. It’s all right,
let’s see.

01:14:08.426 --> 01:14:12.125
We’ll have to get separate ones for them.
For every…

01:14:12.326 --> 01:14:15.000
(Warren: “For some reason they held them
separately in the…”)

01:14:15.201 --> 01:14:18.614
All right, then it’s all right.

01:14:21.916 --> 01:14:25.154
Yes. You’ll give it. That’s right.

01:15:04.443 --> 01:15:10.709
Yogi: The sari. Javier: Sari.
Yogini: Sari… Yogi: I gave it.

01:15:19.428 --> 01:15:23.176
Shri Mataji: Just keep it. Just keep it.

01:15:30.956 --> 01:15:33.895
Towel.

01:15:43.391 --> 01:15:50.609
Now. I’ll take water. Water to drink.
Water.

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:12.330
That’s all. That’s all.

01:16:58.921 --> 01:17:02.877
Hold it. Hold it.

01:17:18.165 --> 01:17:23.374
Honey. Now honey.

01:18:16.511 --> 01:18:19.228
It’s all right.

01:20:44.885 --> 01:20:50.642
Sugar, sugar.

01:20:52.829 --> 01:20:56.203
Sugar.

Water.

Sugar, sugar.

01:21:38.345 --> 01:21:41.648
Sugar, sugar.

01:21:58.176 --> 01:22:01.272
Water, water.

01:22:15.559 --> 01:22:20.164
Saffron, saffron is there.

01:22:46.815 --> 01:22:50.086
Some water.

01:23:45.688 --> 01:23:49.275
Now. Clean one…

01:24:15.337 --> 01:24:19.162
Scent. Scent.

01:24:41.902 --> 01:24:45.285
Scent. On the swastikas.

01:25:43.754 --> 01:25:46.581
Yes, yes. Attar.

01:25:54.042 --> 01:25:55.536
They’ll have… good.

01:25:55.737 --> 01:26:03.086
(To a girl) Please put it to all of them
like this. Yes.

01:26:18.249 --> 01:26:19.680
Girl: All the women?
Shri Mataji: On the wrist.

01:26:19.881 --> 01:26:21.514
Girl: All the women?
Shri Mataji: Eh?

01:26:21.715 --> 01:26:24.922
Girl: All the women?
Shri Mataji: To all of them.

01:26:28.839 --> 01:26:30.857
I told her to put to all of them
the Chandan gandha.

01:26:31.058 --> 01:26:33.757
Did she understand that?
[Yogi: “Yes”]

01:26:36.739 --> 01:26:41.749
Now. Ah, with flowers.

01:27:07.008 --> 01:27:11.153
Sari, sari. So…

01:27:21.102 --> 01:27:24.095
Warren? Warren?

01:27:24.296 --> 01:27:27.022
There’s no blouse with it?

01:27:27.223 --> 01:27:31.103
Half, half, put it half way.

01:27:31.327 --> 01:27:34.774
[Yogi: “There is a blouse”]
There’s a blouse, where is it?

01:27:52.984 --> 01:27:57.670
Maricruz, Maricruz.

01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:25.763
There, good… Leave it there. Yes, good,
leave it there. Tell her to leave it.

01:28:33.901 --> 01:28:42.658
Now. Every lady has to take a fruit and
the rice - hello?

01:28:42.859 --> 01:28:47.574
Every lady has to take a fruit in the hand,
and -

01:28:47.879 --> 01:28:52.674
a fruit in the hand and some rice and put
it here.

01:28:52.875 --> 01:28:57.274
See, I’ll take it a little. Where is
the cloth?

01:28:57.977 --> 01:29:01.937
There’s a cloth there. That’s it.

01:29:09.091 --> 01:29:13.381
Now you tell them. To catch one fruit
in the hand.

01:29:13.582 --> 01:29:16.725
Yogi: Before the sari, Mother?
Shri Mataji: No, sari is all right.

01:29:16.926 --> 01:29:21.597
Keep it like that. Now fruit is there.
Now, take the fruit.

01:29:21.798 --> 01:29:26.409
You see, will be confusion, that’s why
to say one by one.

01:29:27.238 --> 01:29:30.492
Keep it. Keep it.
[Yogi: “After the sari”]

01:29:31.314 --> 01:29:34.711
See, take the akshata (rice).

01:29:44.772 --> 01:29:50.333
Yes. Now you hold it. You hold the sari.
Hold it.

01:29:54.489 --> 01:29:58.000
Like that. Yes. Yes, take one side.

01:30:56.666 --> 01:31:00.675
Yes, she has all…

01:31:09.170 --> 01:31:12.290
All right, now.

01:31:13.205 --> 01:31:20.597
If this you can remove, then we can go
ahead, well, with flowers.

01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:24.931
Just remove these, one by one.

01:31:25.137 --> 01:31:29.968
It’s dangerous. Just remove those
(candles)…

01:31:58.021 --> 01:32:01.178
You better have the sari now.

01:32:01.379 --> 01:32:04.769
But they have got something for the hands?

01:32:04.970 --> 01:32:10.147
Flowers for the hands, they have any?

01:32:10.348 --> 01:32:12.962
No? Just flowers, ask them,

01:32:13.163 --> 01:32:17.878
otherwise they might be disappointed,
if they have made.

01:32:23.086 --> 01:32:25.372
Garland?
[Yogi: “There is a big garland”]

01:32:25.573 --> 01:32:28.995
All right. Now. You put this.

01:32:32.063 --> 01:32:35.438
The other way round. Yes.

01:33:04.096 --> 01:33:12.959
Put the flowers around… And some garland.

01:33:33.581 --> 01:33:39.364
Yes. Exactly, when you have finished.

01:33:41.741 --> 01:33:45.386
Yes. Now the garland has to be put.
Oh, you got that?

01:33:45.587 --> 01:33:50.007
Yes, that’s what I’ve asked. That’s
beautiful.

01:33:50.208 --> 01:33:56.919
So I’ll wear the garland first and then
the… All right.

01:34:59.179 --> 01:35:02.141
(The crown) tie it up more.

01:35:06.988 --> 01:35:11.602
Tighter, still. Now, still tighter.

01:35:26.740 --> 01:35:29.978
Should be tighter as it is. It’s all right?

01:35:30.179 --> 01:35:33.608
Now I’ll have.

01:35:50.770 --> 01:35:55.670
Some photographs, if some people want
to take?

01:35:58.317 --> 01:36:02.796
Cloth there, in the corner.

01:36:27.196 --> 01:36:30.244
Make it neat, so the whole thing comes out,

01:36:30.445 --> 01:36:33.193
and now you can put the lights and
everything,

01:36:33.394 --> 01:36:36.202
so you get a full picture of the puja –

01:36:36.403 --> 01:36:41.000
remove that towel and make…

01:40:41.324 --> 01:40:43.577
Shri Mataji: Now, can you little bit do
it neat

01:40:43.778 --> 01:40:46.968
and then we’ll have the Aarti.

01:40:53.018 --> 01:40:56.549
What is there?
[Prasad is offered to Shri Mataji]

01:42:10.146 --> 01:42:13.582
Sahaja Yogi 1: Thank you, Shri Mataji.
Sahaja Yogi 2: Aarti.

01:50:17.267 --> 01:50:22.188
Yogi: Bolo Shri Bhagavati Mataji

01:50:22.389 --> 01:50:28.750
Shri Nirmala Devi ki!
Yogis: Jai!

01:50:58.268 --> 01:51:02.198
Shri Mataji: May God bless you all.
May God bless you all.

01:51:02.399 --> 01:51:05.487
May God bless you all.

01:51:07.052 --> 01:51:09.770
May God bless you.

01:51:11.011 --> 01:51:15.698
It’s very good, everybody has very good
Kundalini.

01:51:15.921 --> 01:51:18.811
May God bless you.

01:51:24.898 --> 01:51:27.829
That’s good.

01:51:53.293 --> 01:51:56.396
May God bless you.

01:52:00.548 --> 01:52:06.433
Except for Vishuddhi, all other chakras are
all right –

01:52:08.622 --> 01:52:10.472
for which you have to say Allah Hu Akbar.

01:52:10.673 --> 01:52:15.235
Say it now, sixteen times.
Yogi: Sixteen times.

01:52:17.047 --> 01:52:21.058
Warren: We should stand. Shri Mataji:
Sixteen times, to open the Vishuddhi.

01:53:23.644 --> 01:53:27.018
All right.

01:53:40.883 --> 01:53:43.392
Good.

01:53:45.087 --> 01:53:49.314
Give yourselves a bandhan. One.

01:53:49.536 --> 01:53:52.118
Slowly.

01:53:53.816 --> 01:53:56.249
Two.

01:53:57.250 --> 01:54:00.940
Three.

01:54:01.284 --> 01:54:04.120
Four.

01:54:04.422 --> 01:54:07.593
Five.

01:54:07.807 --> 01:54:11.759
Six. And seven.

01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:15.173
Now raise your Kundalini.

01:54:17.050 --> 01:54:22.656
Tie it up. One. Again.

01:54:24.487 --> 01:54:29.184
Tie it up. Again.

01:54:29.385 --> 01:54:34.656
Now tie it up three times. Fix it up on top
of your heads.

01:54:34.856 --> 01:54:41.697
One – two – three.

01:54:41.898 --> 01:54:46.471
Very clear, today it’s very clear.

01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:49.382
Ah!

01:54:50.665 --> 01:54:53.523
Can you see?

01:54:55.534 --> 01:54:58.240
Feeling?

01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:04.558
All right. May God bless you.

01:55:14.181 --> 01:55:18.144
Warren, I can wash My Feet in the room
or not?

01:55:22.579 --> 01:55:26.612
You have to take out these things here.
(Warren: “The ladies”.)

01:55:28.195 --> 01:55:32.101
Or we can go in the room and take it out.

01:55:32.302 --> 01:55:36.716
It’s all right. (Yogi: “All right”)
… Yes.

01:55:46.637 --> 01:55:49.388
Warren: It’s vibrations on the gold.

01:55:49.589 --> 01:55:52.573
Shri Mataji: Ah!

01:55:53.745 --> 01:55:57.901
This was - are they given by the English,
I think.

01:55:58.102 --> 01:56:01.323
All right, yes. [Warren: “Yes”]

01:56:12.968 --> 01:56:15.999
Take it closer first, then it will become
good.

01:56:16.200 --> 01:56:20.032
Bring it closer (not clearly audible)…
Warren: Take it closer.

01:56:26.713 --> 01:56:30.098
Other Sahaja Yogi: Mother, we have some
presents.

01:56:30.299 --> 01:56:33.886
Shri Mataji: Presents? Oh, have you?
Sahaja Yogi: Can I bring?

01:56:34.087 --> 01:56:37.060
Shri Mataji: All right.

01:56:39.494 --> 01:56:43.566
But not too many, you have given Me
those presents today.

01:57:01.167 --> 01:57:05.541
Warren? This also goes... now, thank you.

01:57:07.124 --> 01:57:10.405
While this is, this one is Mine, and this
one is –

01:57:10.606 --> 01:57:15.194
or you can keep it in your bag (necklace).

01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:23.741
[Yogi: “Can I help, Mother?”]

01:58:01.675 --> 01:58:04.526
This one also (bracelet).

01:58:20.847 --> 01:58:26.557
It’s all right. Please, be seated.

01:58:30.641 --> 01:58:32.690
Yogi: This is the collective present from
Spanish people, Shri Mataji.

01:58:32.891 --> 01:58:34.101
Shri Mataji: From where?
Sahaja Yogi: Collective present.

01:58:34.301 --> 01:58:36.558
Shri Mataji From Spanish?
[Yogi: “Yes”.]

01:58:36.759 --> 01:58:39.450
Thank you very much.

01:58:40.081 --> 01:58:42.003
[Yogi: “May I help You, Shri Mataji?”.]
Beautiful rose you have made.

01:58:42.204 --> 01:58:45.766
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, yes, yes, decoration.

01:58:46.490 --> 01:58:48.470
May I help You, Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: Yes, I am not very good

01:58:48.671 --> 01:58:54.952
at it, thank you. Only I can open
Kundalini.

01:59:30.658 --> 01:59:36.413
It’s beautiful, this is Toledo work, yes!

01:59:39.603 --> 01:59:45.972
Beautiful, beautiful.

01:59:46.173 --> 01:59:47.858
Chakras is,

01:59:48.059 --> 02:00:00.035
this is the what you call the birds flying,
like the Holy Ghost.

02:00:00.236 --> 02:00:04.340
Thank you very much, very beautiful,
very beautiful.

02:00:04.541 --> 02:00:08.982
You must write it down here from
Spanish people.

02:00:09.183 --> 02:00:11.228
And date, because you know, so many
presents,

02:00:11.429 --> 02:00:15.750
and they’ll be all going in the personal
archives.

02:00:21.975 --> 02:00:27.604
Yes, so. So the progeny can see what
you people have given the Mother.

02:00:37.307 --> 02:00:40.300
Oh, thank you very much.

02:00:52.118 --> 02:00:55.482
So their engagement is now announced

02:00:55.683 --> 02:01:02.194
and they’ll be getting married in
Ganapatipule, both of them. Fernando …

02:01:31.121 --> 02:01:33.953
May God bless you.

02:01:48.994 --> 02:01:51.758
Take this.

02:01:58.617 --> 02:02:01.927
I’ve tried to (open the package).

02:02:25.595 --> 02:02:33.745
Oh beautiful, it’s very beautiful.

02:02:38.272 --> 02:02:44.538
Nice, isn’t it? Beautiful. Thank you
very much, thank you.

02:02:45.925 --> 02:02:49.785
I hope you have written your name there,
somewhere.

02:02:49.986 --> 02:02:53.112
Inside the box could be,

02:02:54.289 --> 02:02:59.485
inside the box, both of you.

02:02:59.746 --> 02:03:05.022
You should have given Me the present
after the marriage, not before.

02:03:09.839 --> 02:03:12.426
As it is.

02:03:18.836 --> 02:03:25.653
I would like to know the list of people who
want to get married and their photographs –

02:03:25.854 --> 02:03:30.230
would be a good idea if you can send it
to us earlier,

02:03:30.431 --> 02:03:33.571
before we go to India.

02:03:46.105 --> 02:03:48.857
I mean, we have a form,

02:03:49.058 --> 02:03:53.031
and you can get those forms from England,

02:03:53.232 --> 02:03:56.211
and they are to be filled in with
a photograph,

02:03:56.412 --> 02:04:01.428
so that we get some time to see for
ourselves, because from all over the world –

02:04:01.629 --> 02:04:07.055
see heights, and also qualifications, and
aptitudes and everything.

02:04:07.256 --> 02:04:11.185
So that we can match better.

02:04:11.415 --> 02:04:15.999
All right. Thank you. Thank you very much
for a very nice puja.

02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:20.719
May God bless you all. Thank you for all
that you have done

02:04:20.920 --> 02:04:25.774
for Sahaja Yoga, and all that you have
done to look after Me.

02:04:25.975 --> 02:04:28.828
A little translate.

02:04:39.136 --> 02:04:42.223
And to look after Me.

02:04:44.092 --> 02:04:46.767
May God bless you.

02:04:51.959 --> 02:04:54.858
Now look after the new people, with care.

02:04:55.059 --> 02:04:59.456
It’s very delicate, with care.

02:05:05.735 --> 02:05:11.263
It’s very delicate, with care.
Then your knowledge.

02:05:17.690 --> 02:05:20.628
May God bless you.

02:05:26.721 --> 02:05:30.367
Very good puja today, very good puja
I must say, very good.

02:06:15.640 --> 02:06:19.079
Beautiful.

02:06:25.968 --> 02:06:30.764
May God bless you. Thank you very much.

02:06:32.998 --> 02:06:36.031
Very good puja I must say, very important.

02:06:36.541 --> 02:06:41.703
Done with heart, that’s the point is.
Done with heart, that is.
