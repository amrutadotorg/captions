00:08:37.506 --> 00:08:42.901
I am so very filled with joy

00:08:44.345 --> 00:08:52.637
 and My heart is so full of gratitude for

00:08:53.224 --> 00:08:58.351
all the Sahaja Yogis who have been able

00:08:58.934 --> 00:09:02.530
to create this beautiful place.

00:09:04.207 --> 00:09:11.884
 I cannot imagine how much they must have worked hard

00:09:12.268 --> 00:09:21.058
 in such a place to create such  a beautiful

00:09:23.928 --> 00:09:29.044
 area, such a blissful place.

00:09:38.163 --> 00:09:44.712
How in Sahaja Yoga people work together

00:09:46.373 --> 00:09:50.902
 with tremendous respect and love for each other,

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:57.091
and produce something that is unbelievable.

00:10:00.126 --> 00:10:02.649
This was just a wilderness,

00:10:03.324 --> 00:10:08.002
and you have brought so much of

00:10:08.462 --> 00:10:12.509
life and light in this place.

00:10:19.414 --> 00:10:25.017
 You wanted to celebrate My birthday.

00:10:27.307 --> 00:10:32.445
 I don't know what is such a significant about it.

00:10:33.311 --> 00:10:39.263
 But the way you have really

00:10:39.677 --> 00:10:43.639
 shown your understanding and respect,

00:10:44.587 --> 00:10:49.270
I am just enamored.  I can't  understand

00:10:49.405 --> 00:10:52.191
 what have I done for you, that

00:10:52.398 --> 00:10:55.588
you should do so much for Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:59.508 --> 00:11:04.647
 As it is, today is also a very auspicious day

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:08.112
 which we call as the Holi.

00:11:08.946 --> 00:11:14.895
They play Holion this day and show their love

00:11:15.752 --> 00:11:19.258
 and oneness among themselves.

00:11:19.782 --> 00:11:23.470
This is the time when we have to

00:11:24.399 --> 00:11:28.716
really understand the value of love,

00:11:29.586 --> 00:11:34.012
of respect of others,

00:11:34.909 --> 00:11:41.288
 because so far we have based all our theories and

00:11:41.662 --> 00:11:47.652
 all our ideas on the principle that human beings

00:11:48.006 --> 00:11:55.262
cannot love each other: they are always trying to overpower others

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:59.950
 or to hate others, or to grab things from others.

00:12:00.752 --> 00:12:04.571
Such a wrong idea we had all these days,

00:12:04.814 --> 00:12:08.825
 and that's why all the organizations that were created

00:12:08.998 --> 00:12:12.595
to obstruct it also got contaminated with it.

00:12:17.507 --> 00:12:23.030
The only way one can really understand

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.848
what we are is by knowing yourself.

00:12:28.403 --> 00:12:32.836
When you know yourself you are surprised that

00:12:33.464 --> 00:12:38.445
what is the greatest thing for you is to love and to be loved.

00:12:39.195 --> 00:12:43.093
 You enjoy that collective love so much

00:12:43.379 --> 00:12:49.330
 when you are absolutely overcome

00:12:49.791 --> 00:12:56.550
 your baser self. In Sahaja Yoga it is so simple.

00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:59.238
It works in a very simple manner.

00:12:59.498 --> 00:13:07.427
 It's very Sahaja, but to grow into it is very important,

00:13:08.178 --> 00:13:11.799
and I am so very happy to see so many of you

00:13:12.016 --> 00:13:17.430
 from all over the world, from Delhi and also from all over India,

00:13:18.422 --> 00:13:21.318
 enjoying that love among yourselves

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:24.842
and understanding among yourselves.

00:13:27.196 --> 00:13:30.690
I never expected that in My lifetime

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:33.712
I'll be able to see all this beautiful

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:38.363
world of love, trust and peace.

00:13:38.832 --> 00:13:43.030
 But today really I must say it shows

00:13:43.339 --> 00:13:47.328
 what we are capable of doing.

00:13:48.035 --> 00:13:56.008
 We human beings, so-called, are very selfish, self-centered

00:13:56.532 --> 00:14:00.055
and only worried about ourselves:

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:05.164
that is what is said; but it's surprising

00:14:05.338 --> 00:14:09.836
 that with Self-Realization, with self-knowledge,

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:15.315
 with knowing yourself, you understand how rich you are within,

00:14:15.696 --> 00:14:20.154
 how great you are within and how capable you are.

00:14:20.789 --> 00:14:23.397
 This understanding comes to you,

00:14:23.643 --> 00:14:28.394
 and then that is expressed in such a beautiful manner.

00:14:30.045 --> 00:14:35.004
Sahaja Yoga took time to grow, slowly and slowly,

00:14:35.941 --> 00:14:42.233
 and that you all have slowly and slowly grown also.

00:14:43.335 --> 00:14:48.740
 But today I must say that it has reached such a height

00:14:49.312 --> 00:14:54.780
that it's difficult for people to get out of it.

00:14:55.456 --> 00:15:00.364
 When you know yourself, when you know what is reality

00:15:00.643 --> 00:15:03.004
and what is absolute truth,

00:15:03.172 --> 00:15:07.473
you just get dissolved into that knowledge.

00:15:07.894 --> 00:15:15.122
 Of course you are not knowledgeable in the way people are;

00:15:15.868 --> 00:15:19.858
you are knowledgeable in the real sense of the word,

00:15:20.249 --> 00:15:27.249
because you realize what is within you is a big power of love.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.201
There's a big power of understanding.

00:15:34.248 --> 00:15:36.945
 There's a big power of understanding,

00:15:37.763 --> 00:15:41.802
 a big power of oneness, of collective.

00:15:42.312 --> 00:15:45.667
This collectivity works wonders

00:15:45.858 --> 00:15:49.746
and gives such joy that we are all one,

00:15:50.091 --> 00:15:55.229
 we have no enemies, we have no problems.

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:59.442
 We are all one together.

00:16:28.642 --> 00:16:34.008
 This joy that was expressed by you

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:42.939
 is like the waves that go to the shores,

00:16:43.709 --> 00:16:48.414
touch the shores and come back, creating beautiful patterns.

00:16:48.724 --> 00:16:51.265
And I see that happening now,

00:16:51.624 --> 00:16:57.184
that these beautiful patterns are showing in your own life,

00:16:57.407 --> 00:17:00.567
 in your lifestyle, in your behavior.

00:17:00.748 --> 00:17:06.830
There is a very special type of human race is sitting before Me.

00:17:07.394 --> 00:17:16.910
 I am so much thankful to you, absolutely,

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:26.176
that you should take to this simple knowledge of yourself

00:17:26.918 --> 00:17:29.750
and enjoy it with others.

00:17:30.014 --> 00:17:35.844
 It's something remarkable that you know about yourself,

00:17:36.432 --> 00:17:39.320
that's only human beings can do.

00:17:39.591 --> 00:17:42.797
 There can be a diamond, very expensive,

00:17:43.051 --> 00:17:45.302
 but it doesn't know its value.

00:17:45.485 --> 00:17:49.954
There could be some dog or some animal

00:17:50.163 --> 00:17:53.316
which must be something par excellence,

00:17:53.507 --> 00:17:56.237
but he doesn't know what he is.

00:17:56.526 --> 00:18:00.121
Same thing happens with the human beings

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.049
till they get their Self-Realization,

00:18:03.271 --> 00:18:10.316
 and after Realization they suddenly become aware of what they are.

00:18:11.332 --> 00:18:17.187
 And then suddenly they become very humble, they become very loving.

00:18:17.707 --> 00:18:21.214
Now supposing if somebody knows that he is a king,

00:18:21.413 --> 00:18:27.280
 or he discovers that he is a some great musician or a

00:18:27.573 --> 00:18:33.492
 prime minister or something: he feels very aloof

00:18:33.723 --> 00:18:37.146
and he thinks no end of himself.

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:41.074
 But by this knowledge that you have,

00:18:41.249 --> 00:18:46.434
 you become one with the rest of Sahaja Yogis and enjoy it.

00:18:46.667 --> 00:18:50.375
 It's very remarkable how it works out

00:18:50.733 --> 00:18:54.037
 that you enjoy each other so much,

00:18:54.365 --> 00:18:59.051
and to do something for this collective work,

00:18:59.242 --> 00:19:03.189
you can dedicate yourself to it.

00:19:04.409 --> 00:19:10.006
Now My experience of seventy-seven years, as you can say,

00:19:10.396 --> 00:19:14.536
 has been really checkered with all kinds of incidents,

00:19:14.662 --> 00:19:19.244
all kinds of people, all kinds of incidents.

00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:24.762
And it's a good vision to see

00:19:25.238 --> 00:19:28.656
 before your eyes that despite all that,

00:19:28.847 --> 00:19:32.188
so many beautiful lotuses have come out,

00:19:32.966 --> 00:19:38.181
 and they are so fragrant, so beautiful,

00:19:38.341 --> 00:19:41.396
 so colorful, so attractive.

00:19:42.478 --> 00:19:49.986
 All this is because we have a innate  value system,

00:19:51.911 --> 00:19:55.592
 because we have inborn within us a great

00:19:55.933 --> 00:20:03.304
 sense of love and compassion.

00:20:04.059 --> 00:20:08.977
 This compassion has to be really

00:20:10.207 --> 00:20:16.411
understood and enjoyed, and jump in the ocean of compassion.

00:20:17.054 --> 00:20:20.671
So beautiful, and you'll be amazed to see

00:20:20.989 --> 00:20:23.845
 that automatically you'll swim,

00:20:24.171 --> 00:20:29.139
automatically you'll meet other people also in the same ocean,

00:20:29.492 --> 00:20:33.304
 and without any problems, without any troubles,

00:20:33.479 --> 00:20:40.363
 all enjoying the bliss of this love,
 this compassion, this Divine love.

00:20:43.363 --> 00:20:47.424
 I must really congratulate

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:52.876
 the Delhi people for coming up so well

00:20:53.843 --> 00:20:59.742
with this beautiful arrangement  and this beautiful pendal,

00:21:00.315 --> 00:21:05.687
and all the beautiful arrangements
they have made outside for your stay.

00:21:05.886 --> 00:21:08.584
 I mean really it's something,

00:21:09.328 --> 00:21:13.888
 I have done nothing for it, nothing, I should say.

00:21:14.451 --> 00:21:17.729
How these people have worked together:

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.118
 there have been no quarrels, fighting,

00:21:21.285 --> 00:21:25.207
 backbiting, nothing of the kind. It's very surprising

00:21:25.588 --> 00:21:29.295
 that such a beautiful thing has been created by them:

00:21:29.621 --> 00:21:33.460
 shows their maturity in Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:34.446 --> 00:21:37.284
 I must congratulate them again and again

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:40.085
for doing this great work

00:21:40.612 --> 00:21:43.124
in such a short time.

00:21:44.079 --> 00:21:46.670
First I talked in English because

00:21:46.695 --> 00:21:49.394
here many people have come from foreign countries

00:21:49.545 --> 00:21:51.855
and you don't have any objection

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.649
that I talk in English for a little while.

00:21:54.818 --> 00:21:59.390
Although it is a great thing of Dehlites

00:21:59.581 --> 00:22:04.945
and along with them the people of Uttarpradesh also joined.

00:22:05.481 --> 00:22:12.627
People of Rajasthan also joined and the people from Haryana also helped.

00:22:12.943 --> 00:22:16.745
All of them have collectively made with love this

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:20.233
very beautiful pandal like a temple.

00:22:20.631 --> 00:22:26.032
On seeing it I was Myself surprised

00:22:26.726 --> 00:22:30.317
that here are such talented artists.

00:22:30.342 --> 00:22:32.275
I didn't know.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:34.940
Wherefrom this art came?

00:22:34.965 --> 00:22:40.739
How did they make it and decorate all this, I can't understand.

00:22:40.764 --> 00:22:47.223
I didn't know that there are artists of such caliber in our country

00:22:47.755 --> 00:22:49.941
and that too caliber of love.

00:22:49.966 --> 00:22:54.380
The power of 'love' and the art of 'love'

00:22:55.073 --> 00:22:58.140
the art of loving everybody

00:22:58.165 --> 00:23:03.112
whosoever will get it, he only can do such an artistic composition.

00:23:03.867 --> 00:23:06.124
One should learn this art

00:23:06.149 --> 00:23:13.979
how can we with the help of our speech, mind and wisdom

00:23:14.004 --> 00:23:18.790
become artists, artists of 'love'

00:23:18.815 --> 00:23:23.518
and how can we give comfort to others

00:23:23.543 --> 00:23:26.381
and joy to others.

00:23:26.406 --> 00:23:31.171
Which lovable talk is such that we can do.

00:23:31.196 --> 00:23:33.471
One it is with the help of speech

00:23:33.711 --> 00:23:38.084
then with wisdom how can we think?

00:23:38.109 --> 00:23:42.691
How can we shower our love among people?

00:23:42.716 --> 00:23:49.831
How can we open our heart in front of others

00:23:49.856 --> 00:23:53.497
and establish them in our heart?

00:23:55.240 --> 00:24:00.823
And we should think that the heart which doesn't have love

00:24:01.283 --> 00:24:05.001
he is not an authority of anything in the world.

00:24:05.611 --> 00:24:11.704
Because whatever he gets, he cannot be contented in any way with that

00:24:11.729 --> 00:24:14.129
he cannot get contentment.

00:24:14.248 --> 00:24:20.410
But when there is an ocean of contentment within you

00:24:20.622 --> 00:24:25.379
what is it that cannot content you?

00:24:25.404 --> 00:24:32.594
When it happens within you and you get the solution

00:24:32.811 --> 00:24:40.758
then, nobody can understand the boundries of that solution

00:24:40.807 --> 00:24:43.802
that nobody can understand this business.

00:24:43.827 --> 00:24:49.560
Such melodious and such beautiful all that happens

00:24:49.585 --> 00:24:51.761
you cannot overlook it.

00:24:52.224 --> 00:24:57.490
Can't understand what i am doing and what others are doing

00:24:57.515 --> 00:25:00.340
what they are saying and what i am saying.

00:25:00.365 --> 00:25:06.059
And how are they covering me with their love

00:25:06.154 --> 00:25:13.829
and how shall we shower them with our love.

00:25:13.854 --> 00:25:16.440
Day and night the same worry goes on

00:25:16.607 --> 00:25:19.073
that today whom I have to meet

00:25:19.098 --> 00:25:23.019
and what loving things should I tell them.

00:25:23.438 --> 00:25:26.902
What useful things should be talked about.

00:25:26.927 --> 00:25:31.969
Because the practice of talking about useless things

00:25:32.285 --> 00:25:33.565
leads only to loss.

00:25:33.771 --> 00:25:35.465
It has never been useful

00:25:35.775 --> 00:25:40.755
and more than that the anger that is there in a human being

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:43.917
leads to all the more complications.

00:25:44.595 --> 00:25:49.559
There was no need to teach you not to do violence

00:25:49.584 --> 00:25:53.761
don't treat anyone badly

00:25:53.786 --> 00:25:56.314
don't destroy anyone

00:25:56.418 --> 00:25:58.183
don't grab somebody's money.

00:25:58.208 --> 00:26:00.092
There is no need to teach all this.

00:26:00.117 --> 00:26:03.821
You became so dignified on your own.

00:26:04.258 --> 00:26:08.125
I said now you too have become lotuses

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:11.475
that you know to give only your fragrance

00:26:11.905 --> 00:26:13.516
and don't know anything else.

00:26:13.541 --> 00:26:17.222
And the joy of giving to others

00:26:17.247 --> 00:26:23.699
and to feel its joy is a strange experience.

00:26:23.755 --> 00:26:27.838
Only people of unique character can do it.

00:26:27.863 --> 00:26:32.038
Now you are the masters of it

00:26:32.063 --> 00:26:37.776
and the heritage that we had kept with you

00:26:38.039 --> 00:26:41.018
you have utilized fully.

00:26:41.043 --> 00:26:43.438
Now that thing is open to everyone

00:26:43.463 --> 00:26:44.629
it didn't harm anyone.

00:26:44.654 --> 00:26:47.173
Now it is a matter of enjoyment.

00:26:48.076 --> 00:26:52.553
Many people in the world are of different types

00:26:52.578 --> 00:26:55.254
but they cannot touch you

00:26:55.574 --> 00:26:58.070
cannot bother you.

00:26:58.095 --> 00:27:03.396
Even if there can be something, that too may be absorbed by you.

00:27:03.421 --> 00:27:04.996
let them join you.

00:27:05.195 --> 00:27:07.565
Watching your lifestyle

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:13.780
let them have atleast the inclination to change their life.

00:27:14.035 --> 00:27:15.724
Let us also change.

00:27:15.749 --> 00:27:17.169
I don't say that

00:27:17.194 --> 00:27:21.454
I have signed the contract of changing this whole world

00:27:21.859 --> 00:27:25.250
but you can sign this contract.

00:27:25.275 --> 00:27:27.926
If you will change this world

00:27:27.951 --> 00:27:33.876
If you invite moral, kind and gentle people

00:27:33.964 --> 00:27:40.078
there is no need to do anything more.

00:27:40.247 --> 00:27:43.703
then you go on looking at it.

00:27:43.728 --> 00:27:49.278
The only important thing is that you get attatched to it

00:27:49.638 --> 00:27:54.707
Get engaged into it and find out how many people can we transform?

00:27:54.732 --> 00:27:59.521
I agree that an ordinary man has got a number of flaws.

00:27:59.546 --> 00:28:04.513
A man full of flaws you can

00:28:04.538 --> 00:28:12.524
very beautifully give knowledge of a good and unknown self

00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:14.603
the self within us.

00:28:14.628 --> 00:28:20.787
When you come into contact with the spirit inside us

00:28:22.104 --> 00:28:26.068
you come to know that others too must do so.

00:28:26.093 --> 00:28:27.442
know yourself all the more.

00:28:27.467 --> 00:28:28.963
They are lost.

00:28:28.988 --> 00:28:33.937
They don't know how much prime wealth they have inside them.

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:36.404
So, they must be given it

00:28:36.429 --> 00:28:39.301
and they must get it.

00:28:39.326 --> 00:28:42.810
When such conversations will start taking place

00:28:42.835 --> 00:28:45.848
you will take its responsibility on your ownself

00:28:46.197 --> 00:28:50.693
that we too should give others this prime wealth.

00:28:50.718 --> 00:28:53.452
Their keys are with you

00:28:53.639 --> 00:29:00.791
and if you somehow give this great contribution

00:29:00.816 --> 00:29:05.127
just watch how they will recognize you

00:29:05.152 --> 00:29:09.240
and how they will be greatful to you.

00:29:09.732 --> 00:29:12.482
The greatest work for you now is that

00:29:12.507 --> 00:29:17.048
you bring as many people as you can to Sahaja state

00:29:17.741 --> 00:29:19.356
and give them this wealth

00:29:19.381 --> 00:29:23.973
and when this will happen

00:29:23.998 --> 00:29:26.659
you will yourself get busy and be happy

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:34.031
and a type of joy which cannot be described

00:29:34.215 --> 00:29:35.215
you will get.

00:29:35.826 --> 00:29:37.528
This has to be done.

00:29:37.553 --> 00:29:41.033
Today you have celebrated My Birthday.

00:29:41.058 --> 00:29:46.465
I should say a lot of thanks for that

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:49.489
and you have done all this joyfully

00:29:49.751 --> 00:29:56.634
but for Me it is so that every year Sahajyoga has been spreading

00:29:56.865 --> 00:30:01.799
and even I too cannot understand its boundries.

00:30:02.022 --> 00:30:05.986
But today you too must take a decision

00:30:06.011 --> 00:30:14.408
that on the birthday of Mother we will try to transform others.

00:30:14.433 --> 00:30:18.237
Our transformation has already been done but must do of others as well.

00:30:18.785 --> 00:30:24.477
This only  will give you complete contentment of this joy.

00:30:24.502 --> 00:30:27.102
Till now the joy you have is limited

00:30:27.127 --> 00:30:29.576
when you will distribute it among others

00:30:29.601 --> 00:30:32.305
and when it will be echoed in others

00:30:32.441 --> 00:30:39.587
when you will come to know about it, understand it

00:30:40.548 --> 00:30:48.163
a great new joy will awaken within yourself.

00:30:48.188 --> 00:30:57.431
I was watching your young boys, children dancing joyfully.

00:30:58.182 --> 00:31:03.606
Krishna got celebrated Holi so that everybody get joy.

00:31:03.631 --> 00:31:09.522
Shri Ram's style made a human being very serious type.

00:31:09.546 --> 00:31:11.987
His life became serious.

00:31:12.012 --> 00:31:15.162
He (Shri Krishna) devised a method so that a human being

00:31:15.187 --> 00:31:18.171
 cound open up himself and play mirthfully.

00:31:18.496 --> 00:31:22.559
Now that thing only Sahajyogis can do practically

00:31:22.584 --> 00:31:27.396
can play Holi with love amongst themselves.

00:31:27.421 --> 00:31:30.840
Not to trouble others

00:31:30.865 --> 00:31:37.255
but to express their own joy and to make feel others joyous as well.

00:31:38.232 --> 00:31:40.453
Eternal blessings to everyone.
