00:08:37.604 --> 00:08:42.999
I am so very filled with joy

00:08:44.443 --> 00:08:52.735
and My heart is so full of gratitude for

00:08:53.322 --> 00:08:58.449
all the Sahaja Yogis who have been able

00:08:59.032 --> 00:09:02.628
to create this beautiful place.

00:09:04.305 --> 00:09:11.982
I cannot imagine how much they must have worked hard

00:09:12.366 --> 00:09:21.156
in such a place to create such  a beautiful

00:09:24.026 --> 00:09:29.142
area, such a blissful place.

00:09:38.261 --> 00:09:44.810
How in Sahaja Yoga people work together

00:09:46.471 --> 00:09:51.000
with tremendous respect and love for each other,

00:09:51.731 --> 00:09:57.189
and produce something that is unbelievable.

00:10:00.224 --> 00:10:02.747
This was just a wilderness,

00:10:03.422 --> 00:10:08.100
and you have brought so much of

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.607
life and light in this place.

00:10:19.512 --> 00:10:25.115
You wanted to celebrate My birthday.

00:10:27.405 --> 00:10:32.543
I don't know what is such a significant about it.

00:10:33.409 --> 00:10:41.012
But the way you have really shown

00:10:41.213 --> 00:10:45.893
your understanding and respect, I am just enamored.

00:10:46.094 --> 00:10:51.922
I can't understand what have I done for you,

00:10:52.123 --> 00:10:56.242
that you should do so much for Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:59.606 --> 00:11:04.860
As it is, today is also a very auspicious day

00:11:05.061 --> 00:11:08.938
which we call as the Holi.

00:11:09.139 --> 00:11:11.944
They play Holi on this day

00:11:12.132 --> 00:11:19.679
and show their love and oneness among themselves.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:25.891
This is the time when we have to really understand

00:11:26.092 --> 00:11:29.147
the value of love,

00:11:29.848 --> 00:11:34.806
of respect of others,

00:11:35.007 --> 00:11:38.800
because so far we have based

00:11:39.019 --> 00:11:44.251
all our theories and all our ideas

00:11:44.452 --> 00:11:50.287
on the principle that human beings cannot love each other.

00:11:51.021 --> 00:11:55.379
They are always trying to overpower others

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.371
or to hate others,

00:11:57.559 --> 00:12:00.649
or to grab things from others.

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:04.669
Such a wrong idea we had all these days,

00:12:04.912 --> 00:12:08.944
and that's why all the organizations that were created

00:12:09.101 --> 00:12:10.704
to obstruct it

00:12:10.905 --> 00:12:14.536
also got contaminated with it.

00:12:17.605 --> 00:12:25.204
The only way one can really understand what we are

00:12:25.405 --> 00:12:28.300
is by knowing yourself.

00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.903
When you know yourself you are surprised

00:12:32.104 --> 00:12:35.711
that what is the greatest thing for you

00:12:35.912 --> 00:12:39.092
is to love and to be loved.

00:12:39.293 --> 00:12:43.318
You enjoy that collective love so much

00:12:43.519 --> 00:12:49.762
when you are absolutely overcome

00:12:49.963 --> 00:12:53.744
your baser self.

00:12:54.573 --> 00:12:56.798
In Sahaja Yoga it is so simple.

00:12:56.999 --> 00:12:59.395
It works in a very simple manner.

00:12:59.596 --> 00:13:01.582
It's very Sahaja!

00:13:01.783 --> 00:13:08.075
But to grow into it is very important,

00:13:08.276 --> 00:13:11.897
and I am so very happy to see so many of you

00:13:12.114 --> 00:13:14.004
from all over the world,

00:13:14.208 --> 00:13:18.319
from Delhi and also from all over India,

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.468
enjoying that love among yourselves

00:13:21.669 --> 00:13:25.686
and understanding among yourselves.

00:13:27.386 --> 00:13:30.874
I never expected that in My lifetime

00:13:31.075 --> 00:13:36.171
I'll be able to see all this beautiful world of love,

00:13:36.372 --> 00:13:38.666
trust and peace.

00:13:38.867 --> 00:13:41.701
But today really I must say,

00:13:41.902 --> 00:13:47.426
it shows what we are capable of doing.

00:13:48.166 --> 00:13:54.629
We human beings, so-called, are very selfish,

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:56.551
self-centered

00:13:56.752 --> 00:14:00.437
and only worried about ourselves.

00:14:00.638 --> 00:14:02.484
That is what is said!

00:14:02.685 --> 00:14:07.958
but it's surprising that with Self-Realization,

00:14:08.159 --> 00:14:12.207
with self-knowledge, with knowing yourself,

00:14:12.408 --> 00:14:15.593
you understand how rich you are within,

00:14:15.794 --> 00:14:17.668
how great you are within

00:14:17.869 --> 00:14:20.686
and how capable you are.

00:14:20.994 --> 00:14:23.540
This understanding comes to you,

00:14:23.741 --> 00:14:29.189
and then that is expressed in such a beautiful manner.

00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:35.838
Sahaja Yoga took time to grow, slowly and slowly,

00:14:36.039 --> 00:14:43.205
and that you all have slowly and slowly grown also.

00:14:43.406 --> 00:14:49.209
But today I must say that it has reached such a height

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:55.332
that it's difficult for people to get out of it.

00:14:55.533 --> 00:14:57.926
When you know yourself,

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:00.540
when you know what is reality

00:15:00.741 --> 00:15:03.146
and what is absolute truth,

00:15:03.347 --> 00:15:07.791
you just get dissolved into that knowledge.

00:15:07.992 --> 00:15:15.765
Of course you are not knowledgeable in the way people are;

00:15:15.966 --> 00:15:20.081
you are knowledgeable in the real sense of the word,

00:15:20.282 --> 00:15:27.347
because you realize what is within you is a big power of love.

00:15:27.538 --> 00:15:30.279
There's a big power of understanding.

00:15:30.475 --> 00:15:32.698
(Can you bring Me some water?) - Hindi

00:15:32.899 --> 00:15:34.230
All right.

00:15:34.431 --> 00:15:37.660
There's a big power of understanding,

00:15:37.861 --> 00:15:42.209
a big power of oneness, of collective.

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:45.701
This collectivity works wonders

00:15:45.902 --> 00:15:50.042
and gives such joy that we are all one,

00:15:50.243 --> 00:15:55.467
we have no enemies, we have no problems.

00:15:55.668 --> 00:15:59.540
We are all one together.

00:16:03.562 --> 00:16:07.085
It goes on faling this.

00:16:09.127 --> 00:16:10.982
It's better.

00:16:11.183 --> 00:16:15.026
Yes, that's the way it should... It's too high.

00:16:15.696 --> 00:16:17.860
It's all right.

00:16:28.677 --> 00:16:34.819
This joy that was expressed by you

00:16:36.151 --> 00:16:43.606
is like the waves that go to the shores,

00:16:43.807 --> 00:16:48.621
touch the shores and come back, creating beautiful patterns.

00:16:48.822 --> 00:16:51.521
And I see that happening now,

00:16:51.722 --> 00:16:57.282
that these beautiful patterns are showing in your own life,

00:16:57.505 --> 00:17:00.665
in your lifestyle, in your behavior.

00:17:00.846 --> 00:17:07.291
There is a very special type of human race is sitting before Me.

00:17:07.492 --> 00:17:17.497
I am so much thankful to you, absolutely,

00:17:17.698 --> 00:17:26.602
that you should take to this simple knowledge of yourself

00:17:27.016 --> 00:17:29.848
and enjoy it with others.

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:36.398
It's something remarkable that you know about yourself,

00:17:36.599 --> 00:17:39.488
that's only human beings can do.

00:17:39.689 --> 00:17:42.895
There can be a diamond, very expensive,

00:17:43.096 --> 00:17:45.400
but it doesn't know its value.

00:17:45.583 --> 00:17:50.052
There could be some dog or some animal

00:17:50.261 --> 00:17:53.414
which must be something par excellence,

00:17:53.605 --> 00:17:56.423
but he doesn't know what he is.

00:17:56.624 --> 00:18:00.497
Same thing happens with the human beings

00:18:00.698 --> 00:18:03.276
till they get their Self-Realization.

00:18:03.477 --> 00:18:05.495
And after Realization,

00:18:05.714 --> 00:18:10.760
they suddenly become aware of what they are.

00:18:11.569 --> 00:18:15.438
And then suddenly they become very humble,

00:18:15.639 --> 00:18:17.604
they become very loving.

00:18:17.805 --> 00:18:21.312
Now supposing if somebody knows that he is a king,

00:18:21.511 --> 00:18:27.031
or he discovers that he is a some great musician

00:18:27.232 --> 00:18:30.066
or a prime minister or something.

00:18:30.267 --> 00:18:33.651
He feels very aloof

00:18:33.852 --> 00:18:37.892
and he thinks no end of himself.

00:18:38.093 --> 00:18:41.172
But by this knowledge that you have,

00:18:41.347 --> 00:18:46.532
you become one with the rest of Sahaja Yogis and enjoy it.

00:18:46.765 --> 00:18:50.630
It's very remarkable how it works out

00:18:50.831 --> 00:18:54.262
that you enjoy each other so much.

00:18:54.463 --> 00:18:59.149
And to do something for this collective work,

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:03.287
you can dedicate yourself to it.

00:19:04.474 --> 00:19:10.293
Now My experience of seventy-seven years, as you can say,

00:19:10.494 --> 00:19:14.733
has been really checkered with all kinds of incidents,

00:19:14.934 --> 00:19:19.985
all kinds of people, all kinds of incidents.

00:19:20.186 --> 00:19:26.900
And it's a good vision to see before your eyes

00:19:27.101 --> 00:19:32.863
that despite all that, so many beautiful lotuses have come out,

00:19:33.064 --> 00:19:38.279
and they are so fragrant, so beautiful,

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.004
so colorful, so attractive.

00:19:42.683 --> 00:19:50.602
All this is because we have an innate value system,

00:19:51.946 --> 00:19:55.830
because we have inborn within us

00:19:56.031 --> 00:20:03.669
a great sense of love and compassion.

00:20:04.094 --> 00:20:12.624
This compassion has to be really understood and enjoyed,

00:20:12.825 --> 00:20:16.951
and jump in the ocean of compassion.

00:20:17.152 --> 00:20:20.886
So beautiful, and you'll be amazed to see

00:20:21.087 --> 00:20:24.126
that automatically you'll swim,

00:20:24.327 --> 00:20:29.389
automatically you'll meet other people also in the same ocean,

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:33.402
and without any problems, without any troubles,

00:20:33.577 --> 00:20:37.278
all enjoying the bliss of this love,

00:20:37.479 --> 00:20:40.901
this compassion, this Divine love.

00:20:43.461 --> 00:20:47.522
I must really congratulate

00:20:47.768 --> 00:20:53.489
the Delhi people for coming up so well

00:20:53.941 --> 00:20:57.521
with this beautiful arrangement

00:20:57.733 --> 00:21:00.212
and this beautiful pendal,

00:21:00.413 --> 00:21:04.236
and all the beautiful arrangements they have made outside

00:21:04.437 --> 00:21:05.967
for your stay.

00:21:06.168 --> 00:21:09.225
I mean really it's something,

00:21:09.426 --> 00:21:14.348
I have done nothing for it, nothing, I should say.

00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:17.827
How these people have worked together:

00:21:18.061 --> 00:21:21.182
there have been no quarrels, fighting,

00:21:21.383 --> 00:21:23.757
backbiting, nothing of the kind.

00:21:23.958 --> 00:21:25.579
It's very surprising

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:29.518
that such a beautiful thing has been created by them;

00:21:29.719 --> 00:21:34.284
shows their maturity in Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:34.485 --> 00:21:37.467
I must congratulate them again and again

00:21:37.668 --> 00:21:40.509
for doing this great work

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:43.917
in such a short time.

00:21:44.118 --> 00:21:46.274
First I talked in English

00:21:46.475 --> 00:21:49.499
because many people have come here from foreign countries.

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:51.777
And you don't have any objection

00:21:51.978 --> 00:21:54.747
that we talk in English for a little while.

00:21:54.948 --> 00:21:59.488
This is an amazing feat by people of Delhi,

00:21:59.679 --> 00:22:05.932
to whom people of Uttar Pradesh joined,

00:22:06.189 --> 00:22:09.242
people from Rajasthan also joined,

00:22:09.453 --> 00:22:12.840
and people from Haryana also helped -

00:22:13.041 --> 00:22:16.069
and together they made with love

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:20.551
this very beautiful pandal like a temple.

00:22:20.752 --> 00:22:26.130
I, Myself, was surprised seeing it

00:22:26.824 --> 00:22:30.264
that there are such talented artists here.

00:22:30.465 --> 00:22:32.298
I didn't know.

00:22:32.499 --> 00:22:35.038
Where did this art come from?

00:22:35.239 --> 00:22:41.024
I can't understand how they made and decorated all this.

00:22:41.225 --> 00:22:47.550
I didn't know that there are such talented artists in our country

00:22:47.751 --> 00:22:50.170
and that too, talent of love.

00:22:50.371 --> 00:22:54.970
The power of love, the art of love

00:22:55.171 --> 00:22:58.321
and the art of loving everybody,

00:22:58.522 --> 00:23:03.764
whosoever gets it, only he can do such an artistic composition.

00:23:03.965 --> 00:23:06.276
One should learn this art

00:23:06.477 --> 00:23:14.303
that how with the help of our speech, heart and mind

00:23:14.504 --> 00:23:19.064
we can become artists, artists of love

00:23:19.265 --> 00:23:24.412
and how we can make others happy by our words,

00:23:24.613 --> 00:23:26.360
and spread joy among them.

00:23:26.561 --> 00:23:31.268
What kind of loving things can we say?

00:23:31.469 --> 00:23:33.699
This is the aspect of speech.

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:38.182
Then with our mind we can think,

00:23:38.383 --> 00:23:43.108
how we can shower our love among people,

00:23:43.309 --> 00:23:49.929
how we can open our heart in front of others

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:54.402
and establish them in our heart.

00:23:55.338 --> 00:23:58.631
And for heart aspect,

00:23:58.832 --> 00:24:01.180
if a person doesn't have love in his heart

00:24:01.381 --> 00:24:05.120
he does not deserve anything in the world;

00:24:05.321 --> 00:24:07.820
because whatever he gets,

00:24:08.021 --> 00:24:12.168
he cannot be satisfied in any way,

00:24:12.369 --> 00:24:14.460
he cannot be content.

00:24:14.661 --> 00:24:20.508
But when there is an ocean of contentment within you

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:25.643
then is there anything that cannot satisfy you?

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:29.434
When it happens within you

00:24:29.622 --> 00:24:32.708
and the peace of contentment establishes within you,

00:24:32.909 --> 00:24:39.043
then, nobody can understand the boundaries of that contentment,

00:24:39.244 --> 00:24:43.841
then nobody can understand this business of contenment.

00:24:44.042 --> 00:24:49.401
All that happens in so sweet and beautiful

00:24:49.602 --> 00:24:52.025
that it is a real spectacle.

00:24:52.226 --> 00:24:57.412
One can't understand what he is doing and what others are doing,

00:24:57.613 --> 00:25:00.440
what they are saying and what he is saying,

00:25:00.641 --> 00:25:06.051
and how are they covering him with their love,

00:25:06.076 --> 00:25:13.829
and how shall he shower his love on them.

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:16.538
Day and night all he worries about is

00:25:16.705 --> 00:25:19.924
that: "Today, whom I have to meet

00:25:20.125 --> 00:25:23.335
and what loving things should I tell them,

00:25:23.536 --> 00:25:27.000
what can I tell them for their benevolence".

00:25:27.201 --> 00:25:31.746
Because the practice of talking about useless things

00:25:31.947 --> 00:25:33.794
leads only to loss.

00:25:33.995 --> 00:25:35.700
It has never been beneficial

00:25:35.901 --> 00:25:41.435
and afterwards the anger that comes in a human being

00:25:41.636 --> 00:25:44.492
leads to even more harm.

00:25:44.693 --> 00:25:49.622
Then there is no need to teach one not to be violent,

00:25:49.823 --> 00:25:54.090
not to treat anyone badly,

00:25:54.291 --> 00:25:56.256
not to destroy anyone,

00:25:56.457 --> 00:25:58.217
and not to cheat anybody for money.

00:25:58.418 --> 00:26:00.331
There is no need to teach all this.

00:26:00.532 --> 00:26:04.278
You became so beautiful on your own.

00:26:04.479 --> 00:26:08.047
I said that you have become lotuses yourselves,

00:26:08.248 --> 00:26:11.802
that you only know to spread your fragrance

00:26:12.003 --> 00:26:13.614
and nothing else.

00:26:13.815 --> 00:26:17.456
And the joy of giving to others -

00:26:17.657 --> 00:26:22.954
to feel that joy is an unique experience.

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:27.862
Only people with a novel personality can do it.

00:26:28.063 --> 00:26:31.960
Now you are the masters of it

00:26:32.161 --> 00:26:37.961
and the heritage that you had,

00:26:38.162 --> 00:26:41.018
you have utilized it fully.

00:26:41.219 --> 00:26:43.320
Now that thing is open to everyone,

00:26:43.521 --> 00:26:44.987
it spread everywhere,

00:26:45.188 --> 00:26:47.973
and now it is about enjoying it.

00:26:48.174 --> 00:26:52.592
There are many different type of people in the world,

00:26:52.795 --> 00:26:55.471
but they cannot touch you,

00:26:55.672 --> 00:26:58.060
cannot bother you.

00:26:58.261 --> 00:27:00.866
If at all something happens,

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:03.469
then it will be that they become one among you

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:05.241
and they would turn in your favour.

00:27:05.442 --> 00:27:07.250
After seeing your life,

00:27:07.451 --> 00:27:13.878
they will at least be inclined to change themselves,

00:27:14.079 --> 00:27:15.940
they will think: "Let us also change".

00:27:16.141 --> 00:27:17.768
I don't say that

00:27:17.969 --> 00:27:21.756
I have taken the responsibility of changing this whole world

00:27:21.957 --> 00:27:25.348
but you can take this responsibility.

00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:27.951
If you change this world,

00:27:28.152 --> 00:27:34.298
if you create virtuous and saintly people,

00:27:34.499 --> 00:27:40.176
then after that there is no need to do anything else.

00:27:40.345 --> 00:27:44.065
Then you just witness and enjoy it.

00:27:44.266 --> 00:27:46.186
The only important thing is

00:27:46.387 --> 00:27:51.354
that you get fully involved into it, start working it out

00:27:51.555 --> 00:27:54.895
and see how many people you can transform.

00:27:55.096 --> 00:27:59.443
It is agreed that an ordinary human being has got a number of flaws.

00:27:59.644 --> 00:28:04.633
Such human being who is full of flaws

00:28:04.834 --> 00:28:13.059
can be beautifully introduced to his great unknown Self.

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:16.981
The Self that is within you, the Atma that is within you -

00:28:17.182 --> 00:28:22.001
when you get introduced to it,

00:28:22.202 --> 00:28:25.908
then you realize that others must do the same.

00:28:26.109 --> 00:28:27.578
They should also know themselves.

00:28:27.779 --> 00:28:29.141
They are lost.

00:28:29.342 --> 00:28:33.947
They don't know what a treasure they have inside.

00:28:34.148 --> 00:28:36.425
So, this (Realization) must be given,

00:28:36.626 --> 00:28:39.398
and they must get it.

00:28:39.599 --> 00:28:42.908
When such discussions begin,

00:28:43.081 --> 00:28:46.094
you will take this responsibility on yourself

00:28:46.295 --> 00:28:50.898
that, "We should give others this treasure, too".

00:28:51.099 --> 00:28:53.550
You have the key to their treasure,

00:28:53.737 --> 00:29:00.826
and if somehow you give this great gift to them,

00:29:01.027 --> 00:29:05.933
then you will see how they are going to recognize you

00:29:06.134 --> 00:29:09.629
and how they will be grateful to you.

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:12.506
The greatest work for you now

00:29:12.707 --> 00:29:17.638
is to bring as many people as you can to that Sahaja state,

00:29:17.839 --> 00:29:19.525
and give them this treasure.

00:29:19.726 --> 00:29:22.135
And when this will happen,

00:29:22.336 --> 00:29:26.757
you will yourself get fully immersed in it and happy

00:29:26.958 --> 00:29:31.037
and you will get a kind of joy,

00:29:31.264 --> 00:29:35.676
which cannot be described.

00:29:35.877 --> 00:29:37.626
This has to be done.

00:29:37.827 --> 00:29:41.064
Today you have celebrated My birthday,

00:29:41.265 --> 00:29:46.584
I am very thankful for that.

00:29:46.785 --> 00:29:49.587
And you have done all this so happily.

00:29:49.795 --> 00:29:51.639
For Me the important thing is

00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:56.642
that every year Sahaja Yoga spread widely

00:29:56.843 --> 00:30:01.791
and even I cannot fathom its boundaries now.

00:30:01.992 --> 00:30:06.084
But, today, you must also take a vow,

00:30:06.269 --> 00:30:09.067
on your Mother's birthday,

00:30:09.268 --> 00:30:14.186
that, "We will all try to transform others".

00:30:14.387 --> 00:30:16.358
We have already got transformed,

00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:18.735
but we should transform others as well.

00:30:18.936 --> 00:30:24.561
Only this will give you the completeness of this joy.

00:30:24.762 --> 00:30:27.200
Till now, the joy you have had is limited,

00:30:27.401 --> 00:30:29.607
but when you will spread it among others,

00:30:29.808 --> 00:30:32.269
and when it will resonate in others -

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:40.381
having this experience and understanding it,

00:30:40.582 --> 00:30:48.389
then a great new joy will awaken within you.

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:54.061
I was watching how young boys and children

00:30:54.273 --> 00:30:58.149
were dancing so joyfully.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:01.352
Shri Krishna started this Holi celebration

00:31:01.553 --> 00:31:03.799
so that everybody would get a state of joy.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.481
Shri Rama's style made human beings very serious type.

00:31:09.682 --> 00:31:11.989
Their life became serious.

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:14.495
He (Shri Krishna) devised a method

00:31:14.696 --> 00:31:18.320
so that human beings break out of their shell and play mirthfully.

00:31:18.539 --> 00:31:25.392
And only Sahaja Yogis can celebrate it (Holi) in a proper way

00:31:25.593 --> 00:31:27.494
with love amongst themselves.

00:31:27.695 --> 00:31:30.827
They do not celebrate to trouble others

00:31:31.035 --> 00:31:33.990
but to express their own joy

00:31:34.195 --> 00:31:38.129
and to make others feel joyous as well.

00:31:38.345 --> 00:31:42.135
Eternal blessings to everyone.
