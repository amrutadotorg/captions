WEBVTT

00:01.875 --> 00:08.074
It has been a very, very joyful evening
for all of us.

00:08.275 --> 00:13.637
And we thank all the people who have
brought

00:13.838 --> 00:19.313
all kinds of entertainment for all of us.

00:19.576 --> 00:23.860
I’m really amazed because last time
I couldn’t go to Spain

00:24.061 --> 00:31.143
despite they had invited Me, but I think
somehow it has taken roots there,

00:31.344 --> 00:38.258
there are so many people who are now
involved in Sahaja Yoga.

00:38.459 --> 00:45.355
It’s very important that places like Spain
should have

00:45.556 --> 00:49.433
many more sahaja yogis I think, I always
thought,

00:49.602 --> 00:53.486
because it’s a country visited by so many
people,

00:53.687 --> 01:01.317
so cosmopolitan, and there are quite a lot
of Turkish influence also.

01:01.518 --> 01:06.304
Despite that we found it was not so much
encouraging,

01:06.505 --> 01:09.912
and Jose was extremely upset with the whole
thing.

01:10.096 --> 01:14.217
And he said: “Mother, what has happened
to these people here?”.

01:14.418 --> 01:17.988
It’s alright now, as you see, it’s very
encouraging,

01:18.189 --> 01:24.144
we have so many beautiful singers,
musicians from Spain,

01:24.345 --> 01:28.151
and there are so many people here who have
come

01:28.352 --> 01:32.402
to entertain you with their beautiful,
melodious music –

01:32.603 --> 01:37.876
specially their rhythm is something really
extraordinary.

01:38.077 --> 01:45.663
Indian music has a rhythm of its own, but
it’s very bound by its systems,

01:45.864 --> 01:50.478
while I find here is absolutely a freedom
to play whichever way you like,

01:50.679 --> 01:55.301
your tabla whichever way you like, your
rhythmic patterns,

01:55.502 --> 01:59.046
which is a very great thing to achieve
also that freedom

01:59.247 --> 02:03.295
despite the fact that it keeps the rhythm
on.

02:03.496 --> 02:10.415
Now the another thing we have to now say
about the

02:10.616 --> 02:17.018
way Belgian people have sung very well,
and the way they have shown their love.

02:17.219 --> 02:21.612
Belgium is another very important country,
where of course there is

02:21.813 --> 02:27.821
European, as you know, capital, and that’s
a very important country

02:28.022 --> 02:32.364
where I’m very happy that Sahaja Yoga
is taking its roots.

02:32.565 --> 02:39.262
Last time I was so happy because the leader
from Belgium

02:39.463 --> 02:42.472
used to always say: “Mother, now what
to do, this Belgian

02:42.633 --> 02:46.137
government is funny, and the Belgian people
are funny”, and all that.

02:46.338 --> 02:50.528
Suddenly he said: “It’s become different
now”. I said: “Why?”.

02:50.729 --> 02:54.903
“Because newspapers are only writing
against the Catholic Church

02:55.104 --> 02:59.252
and they have forgotten us completely”.

03:06.695 --> 03:12.432
That’s very a promising thing that people
are now taking to Sahaja Yoga in Belgium

03:12.633 --> 03:18.487
in such a serious manner, and they must
understand their responsibility

03:18.688 --> 03:24.685
as they have got the capital of Europe with
them.

03:24.886 --> 03:32.658
So they have to be people of very lofty
ideas and of very high culture.

03:32.835 --> 03:39.900
I must say for art, they are real artists
there, they really respect art,

03:40.101 --> 03:43.180
and they have a great sense of art, even
now

03:43.381 --> 03:46.997
after all this modern art has come, all
these things have come.

03:47.198 --> 03:54.243
But I think that the number of artists we
have in Belgium in Sahaja Yoga

03:54.444 --> 03:58.219
are the largest in the whole of Europe,
it’s surprising,

03:58.420 --> 04:06.190
but there are so many artists in our Belgian
Sahaja Yoga,

04:06.391 --> 04:11.673
that sometimes I feel that it’s a
combination, say, music coming from Spain,

04:11.874 --> 04:17.728
and from Belgium this art is coming, it’s
really great.

04:17.929 --> 04:23.828
Now we have Holland, and Holland also now
coming up in music, I must say,

04:24.029 --> 04:30.034
but the way they showed the sahaja yogis
to begin with, how they are

04:30.235 --> 04:34.866
and how gradually they change when their
ego and their…

04:35.067 --> 04:41.025
superego burst out is very realistic.
I’ve seen this.

04:41.960 --> 04:44.934
I’m sorry.

04:46.306 --> 04:53.128
I’ve seen it, you see, sometimes that some
sahaja yogis, you see, in the beginning,

04:53.329 --> 04:57.976
they are not all of them like that they were
showing in Belgium - in Holland,

04:58.177 --> 05:02.617
but some sahaja yogis in the beginning,
you just don’t understand them

05:02.818 --> 05:08.771
what they are talking about. And – see,
they just start talking so big and,

05:08.972 --> 05:14.047
as if they have read too much maybe, or
they are too much conditioned,

05:14.248 --> 05:16.844
whatever it is. Then you just look at them,

05:17.045 --> 05:20.565
with understanding there’s something wrong
somewhere,

05:20.766 --> 05:27.117
and ultimately really the conditioning goes
away and the ego also bursts out,

05:27.318 --> 05:30.193
and then they become very good sahaja
yogis.

05:30.394 --> 05:35.501
But so many sahaja yogis are there who just
jumped into Sahaja Yoga.

05:35.735 --> 05:40.258
That’s something also very remarkable. But
sometimes who jump very fast

05:40.459 --> 05:45.698
do not go very deep, it’s a very funny thing
about human beings I can’t understand.

05:45.910 --> 05:49.194
That sometimes they take time to take
to Sahaj Yog,

05:49.395 --> 05:52.209
and once they take to Sahaja Yoga they go
very deep.

05:52.410 --> 05:57.311
And sometimes they take no time, they just
jumped into it,

05:57.512 --> 06:02.018
and then afterwards you just don’t
understand why they are still

06:02.219 --> 06:09.774
at the same point, same height, and they’re
still not going deep into it.

06:09.975 --> 06:17.323
So it’s all has something to do I think
with all the education one must have had,

06:17.524 --> 06:22.324
or maybe the way they are brought up,
or maybe their childhood, or maybe

06:22.531 --> 06:27.624
some psychological problem – or could be
some sort of a egoistical treatment

06:27.825 --> 06:32.501
they have developed or some sort
of a complication within.

06:32.702 --> 06:38.739
But that doesn’t matter, ultimately
everybody comes up and become

06:38.940 --> 06:45.992
a very good source of Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja
Yoga is now on your shoulders,

06:46.193 --> 06:50.047
you have to look after it, you have
to spread it.

06:50.248 --> 06:54.119
Music is one way you can spread – in India,
Maharashtra specially,

06:54.320 --> 06:58.195
every Saturday they take a truck,

06:58.396 --> 07:01.708
on the truck so many musicians go from
places to places,

07:01.909 --> 07:06.459
and they arrange the program there, give
a program and then talk about Sahaja Yoga.

07:06.660 --> 07:10.950
Like that it’s spreading very fast, that
way, even in Delhi.

07:11.151 --> 07:14.459
In Delhi I was surprised which I used
to think is nothing,

07:14.660 --> 07:19.528
absolutely an empty shell, but Delhi has
become so great now.

07:19.729 --> 07:26.635
Because the people started going round to
other villages, and spreading Sahaja Yoga,

07:26.836 --> 07:30.117
and developing that confidence within
themselves.

07:30.318 --> 07:33.630
The confidence comes when you give
realizations to others.

07:33.831 --> 07:38.757
Apart from that, the joy that you get
by giving realization is the greatest.

07:38.958 --> 07:44.537
You – as if like a mother when she gives
birth to a child, how happy she feels.

07:44.738 --> 07:49.258
In the same way you also feel that you have
been able to give realizations to others,

07:49.459 --> 07:54.731
and that is how Sahaja Yoga spreads a lot.
Now from Finland, I’m very happy

07:54.932 --> 07:59.075
that people have come all the way from
Finland, because

07:59.276 --> 08:03.781
so far I didn’t go to Finland, and they
have been doing some work

08:03.982 --> 08:08.393
also in the Belarus - is that right?
(Somebody says something)

08:08.594 --> 08:13.566
Yes. So you see, it’s a thing they are
moving out from their place

08:13.767 --> 08:18.410
and going to these places which I may not
be able to reach.

08:18.611 --> 08:22.289
And other Scandinavian countries are also
represented here,

08:22.490 --> 08:28.573
and I wish I could go sometime to
Scandinavia to spread Sahaja Yoga there.

08:28.774 --> 08:33.188
I’ve been there, but – I’ve been to Finland
also, as I must say,

08:33.389 --> 08:38.118
but I didn’t do any work for Sahaja Yoga
there.

08:38.319 --> 08:44.027
So, you see, Finland I went later on, but
other Scandinavian countries also

08:44.228 --> 08:51.947
I wish I could go, and if My health permits
and My age as you know is –

08:52.148 --> 08:56.492
traveling becomes rather difficult for Me.
But in that case I would request all of you

08:56.693 --> 09:01.460
to do something in all these countries
where I may not have touched

09:01.661 --> 09:03.969
or maybe Sahaja Yoga is not growing.

09:04.170 --> 09:08.019
Where Sahaja Yoga is not growing you should
go all out to help them.

09:08.220 --> 09:12.451
It’s a very remarkable thing how we come
from different countries

09:12.652 --> 09:15.487
and different cultures, speaking different
languages,

09:15.688 --> 09:22.680
and how we understand the language of heart,
language of love, which is Divine love.

09:22.881 --> 09:32.255
So tomorrow will be our great Puja of
Kundalini – they call it Kundalini Puja,

09:32.456 --> 09:38.535
or Adi Shakti Puja, whatever they may call
it – but I think I’ll be able

09:38.736 --> 09:45.888
to say something new tomorrow for all
of you to enjoy.

09:46.089 --> 09:51.690
I cannot entertain as you can entertain,
but somehow I’ve seen that My  –

09:51.891 --> 09:58.775
whatever I’m saying you all listen to Me
so intensely

09:58.976 --> 10:04.582
that must be some entertainment there,
I think so.

10:05.538 --> 10:11.959
So may God bless you all. Have a nice
evening and sleep now.

10:12.160 --> 10:16.067
And tomorrow morning I have asked some
people to see Me.

10:16.268 --> 10:22.260
I hope they will come and see Me and
I'll be very happy.

10:22.906 --> 10:26.031
May God bless you. May God bless you.
