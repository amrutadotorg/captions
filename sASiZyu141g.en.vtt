00:00:02.833 --> 00:00:06.680
Today we have gathered here

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:14.693
to do the Puja to Sadashiva.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.890
The One, which is reflected within us,
is the Shiva,

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.204
which is the pure Spirit.

00:00:35.193 --> 00:00:40.590
This pure Spirit within us is
the reflection

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.503
of God Almighty, Sadashiva.

00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:58.864
It’s like the sun that falls in the water

00:00:59.065 --> 00:01:04.905
and gives a clear reflection.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.370
Or else it falls on the stone,

00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:14.995
it doesn’t give any reflection at all.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.925
If you have, say, the mirror,

00:01:19.126 --> 00:01:24.259
the sun will not only fall on the mirror

00:01:24.483 --> 00:01:31.187
but will reflect back its light.

00:01:32.072 --> 00:01:36.019
In the same way in the human beings

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:48.369
the reflection of God Almighty is expressed
in the way your personality is.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.980
If your personality is clean and clear,
innocent,

00:01:55.181 --> 00:02:00.370
then the reflection could be like a mirror.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:11.200
Thus the saintly people, they reflect God
Almighty in the proper manner,

00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:19.886
in the sense that their own identification
with wrong things is no more.

00:02:20.087 --> 00:02:24.068
When there is no such identification

00:02:24.283 --> 00:02:31.930
and when a person is absolutely the pure
Spirit,

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:38.280
then the reflection of God reflects into
others.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.933
Luckily you all have got your Self
Realization.

00:02:45.134 --> 00:02:48.839
That means the reflection of God Almighty

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.459
is already working into your attention.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:04.825
The attention is enlightened by the power
of the Spirit.

00:03:05.026 --> 00:03:12.899
The power of the Spirit is that it is
a reflection.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:20.076
That means the reflection is never
identified

00:03:20.277 --> 00:03:27.867
with the mirror or with the water.

00:03:28.902 --> 00:03:34.177
It is there till the sun shines,

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.310
and when there is no sun there is
no reflection.

00:03:40.803 --> 00:03:53.291
So when you are in Sahaja Yoga you have
cleansed out yourself.

00:03:53.492 --> 00:03:57.190
Your Kundalini has also cleansed you,

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.690
and now you are pure personalities.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:08.080
That’s why this reflection is clearer and
clearer,

00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:12.049
and people see it; see it on your face;

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.379
they see it in your body; they see it
in your work;

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.740
in your behaviour; in everywhere.

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:28.960
It is difficult for people to really
believe in themselves,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.110
that they could be the reflection of God
Almighty.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:40.957
They have some sort of a, complexes about
themselves I think,

00:04:41.158 --> 00:04:48.041
that they cannot understand how they have
suddenly become

00:04:48.242 --> 00:04:52.029
the reflection of God Almighty,

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.313
but they have a capacity; and they can
become

00:05:01.514 --> 00:05:05.440
the reflection of God Almighty,

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.200
for which they have to have faith
in themselves,

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.719
faith in their ascent, to believe that we
have become that.

00:05:18.407 --> 00:05:24.867
The confidence in Sahaja Yoga is very
important.

00:05:25.068 --> 00:05:30.329
Without the full confidence you cannot
achieve your ascent.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.868
That you have seen even in my lectures,

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:38.300
I have to tell them that we have to have
full self-confidence.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:45.469
But confidence doesn’t mean by any chance
your ego, your aggressiveness.

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:51.649
If you are confident, you are least
aggressive.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.774
There is a story, a Chinese story, very
interesting one:

00:05:56.987 --> 00:06:07.728
that one king wanted his cocks to win in
the race they have about the cock-fighting.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:13.484
So somebody said that “There is a saint,
if you can take your cocks to him,

00:06:13.685 --> 00:06:20.580
he’ll make them so strong that they will
definitely win this race.”

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.809
So he took his two cocks and gave it to
the saint and he said,

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:31.958
“I want you to give them all the strength
to fight this race.”

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:38.595
After one month the king came and took
these two cocks,

00:06:38.796 --> 00:06:43.886
and put them in the arena where there were
many other cocks also.

00:06:44.087 --> 00:06:52.838
So the cocks started fighting and attacking
these two cocks,

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:55.405
but these two cocks were just standing

00:06:55.606 --> 00:07:01.440
very patiently, absolutely calm and quiet.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:08.416
Any kind of attack they were just looking
at it as a fun,

00:07:08.617 --> 00:07:12.820
and all the cocks got tired and they ran
away from the arena,

00:07:13.021 --> 00:07:17.958
and that’s how these two cocks won
the game.

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:21.760
This is what it is for us to understand,

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:27.382
that for a person who is detached he can
never be attacked.

00:07:27.583 --> 00:07:32.335
We are attacked by so many we have.

00:07:32.536 --> 00:07:38.199
Firstly our family, then our country,

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.000
then our religion, then all kinds of thing,
racialism.

00:07:43.201 --> 00:07:46.599
All these identifications really make
us weak,

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.225
because they attack us all the time

00:07:49.426 --> 00:07:54.380
and put confusion into the minds of Sahaja
Yogis, I have seen.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:58.000
The reason is, you must have confidence
in Sahaja Yoga

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.850
and confidence in yourself, that you are
on the right path

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:08.290
and that you are now saved, and nobody
can attack you

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:12.569
because you have the complete protection
of the Divine.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:14.933
People may follow any religion,

00:08:15.134 --> 00:08:18.230
they may follow any guru, they may follow
anything,

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:23.380
but they have fear all the time that
we’ll be attacked,

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.732
and they’re afraid to say things, which
they should say.

00:08:26.933 --> 00:08:32.309
They have no discretion even to know what
is to be said.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:40.710
With the proper understanding that you are
the pure Spirit,

00:08:40.911 --> 00:08:45.283
if you believe in that then you’ll be
surprised

00:08:45.484 --> 00:08:52.634
that you will be very confident about what
you are doing.

00:08:52.835 --> 00:09:00.395
In that way we can say that we have also
another great advantage –

00:09:00.596 --> 00:09:04.492
is that we are in the collective.

00:09:04.693 --> 00:09:11.060
We can find out in the collective how are
we behaving.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.379
What is the reaction in the collective?

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:20.598
In the collective it’s a person who is very
subtle,

00:09:20.799 --> 00:09:24.586
he need not talk too much, he need not
say much.

00:09:24.787 --> 00:09:28.190
He could stand like the cocks I told you
about,

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:31.714
but his depth can be felt.

00:09:31.915 --> 00:09:35.350
You can feel a person of that caliber,

00:09:35.551 --> 00:09:40.499
that he’s such a deep person, that he
doesn’t want to aggress.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:44.180
He feels protected within himself.

00:09:44.381 --> 00:09:46.870
So this protection we have to feel,

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:50.804
not mentally but within ourselves,

00:09:51.005 --> 00:09:54.280
and once you have that gravity,

00:09:54.486 --> 00:09:59.439
that feeling, nobody can attack you.

00:09:59.755 --> 00:10:07.263
The attacking person himself is insecure;
or maybe he is ill-bred;

00:10:07.464 --> 00:10:11.720
maybe he is not yet a Sahaja Yogi.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:19.666
So you have to just have a kind of
a gracious view

00:10:19.885 --> 00:10:25.631
about the person. Like Shiva was.

00:10:25.832 --> 00:10:28.536
We should say Sadashiva’s character
is known,

00:10:28.737 --> 00:10:33.459
that He is the one who used to forgive
anyone.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.790
Anybody who did penance like standing
on their heads

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:42.524
or standing on one foot or not eating their
food or all kinds of penances,

00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:49.359
He used to be so disgusted that He would
say: “Alright, what do you want? Take it!”

00:10:49.677 --> 00:10:53.651
And He also gave blessings to manyrakshasas

00:10:53.852 --> 00:10:57.846
as you have heard and so many rakshasas
were blessed by Him,

00:10:58.047 --> 00:11:03.580
because He got fed up with their penances.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:15.060
There were so many stories about Sadashiva
giving a blessing to people.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:20.120
Even to Ravana, which is a very interesting
story about Ravana,

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.119
that Ravana did lots of penance. I don’t
know what he did,

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:30.721
how much he must have starved with his
ten heads and what …

00:11:30.922 --> 00:11:36.490
I mean, if one mouth is there you feel so
hungry – with ten mouths!

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:40.968
I don’t know what he must have done

00:11:41.169 --> 00:11:44.709
to do that kind of a penance that Shiva
just got fed up, you see.

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.969
His compassion is so great He thought:

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.725
“Let this man have whatever he likes.”

00:11:49.926 --> 00:11:54.510
So Ravana went to Shiva and Shiva said:
“What do you want?

00:11:54.710 --> 00:12:00.447
Why are you doing all this to yourself?”
So he said that

00:12:00.648 --> 00:12:03.836
“I want to have a blessing”. He said:
“What blessing?”

00:12:04.037 --> 00:12:07.710
“First you promise that whatever I ask for,
you will give me.”

00:12:07.911 --> 00:12:10.880
He said: “Of course. If it is in my power,
I’ll give”.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.280
It’s a very interesting story.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:19.270
So he said: “I want to have your wife”.

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:22.420
Because he knew His wife is Adi Shakti,

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:27.759
and if he gets the Adi Shakti as a partner
with him,

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.285
he can do wonders.

00:12:30.486 --> 00:12:39.294
So he asked that: “I should get your wife
as my partner.”

00:12:41.056 --> 00:12:45.479
Now, it was very difficult, you see, for
Him to take such a decision

00:12:45.704 --> 00:12:52.010
to give in to this devil, but in compassion
He did it.

00:12:52.211 --> 00:12:55.452
And all these events you see really show

00:12:55.653 --> 00:13:01.952
that how His compassion works out things.

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:11.024
As a result it was decided that

00:13:11.225 --> 00:13:18.190
His wife Parvati had to go with this
horrible fellow.

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:26.875
But Parvati’s sister (brother) was Shri
Vishnu, that is Shri Krishna,

00:13:27.076 --> 00:13:33.158
and He said to Himself that: “I can’t allow

00:13:33.359 --> 00:13:36.830
my sister to go with this devil. I must do
something about it.”

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:42.938
The most mischievous one is Shri Krishna.
So what He did was

00:13:43.139 --> 00:13:49.220
to make him feel like going for the
bathroom.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.076
So he felt shy, he put the lady on one side

00:13:52.277 --> 00:13:59.755
and he went to the bathroom. Now Shiva
had warned him that:

00:13:59.956 --> 00:14:03.040
“You’d better be careful, because this
Mother Earth

00:14:03.241 --> 00:14:08.117
is the mother of this lady, and never put
Her on the Mother Earth.

00:14:08.318 --> 00:14:12.790
You must carry Him (Her) all the time
on your back.”

00:14:12.991 --> 00:14:17.480
So when he reached a certain point

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.433
this Shri Krishna created a mischief,

00:14:22.634 --> 00:14:24.969
and he felt like going.

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:27.186
So he put Her down. As soon as he put
Her down,

00:14:27.387 --> 00:14:33.030
the Mother Earth sucked Her in and he
didn’t know what to do.

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:36.108
Second time again he tried.

00:14:36.309 --> 00:14:40.334
And he again went to Shiva and he said:

00:14:40.535 --> 00:14:45.130
“See now, this is what you have promised,
and this is what he is doing.”

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:50.159
So He said: “I had warned you that Her
brother is a very mischievous fellow

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:54.410
and He’ll somehow or other manage,
so you’d better be careful.

00:14:54.611 --> 00:14:58.164
This time you don’t listen to him.

00:14:58.365 --> 00:15:02.094
Don’t put Her on the ground, whatever
it may be.”

00:15:02.295 --> 00:15:09.963
So this time he did another try,

00:15:10.164 --> 00:15:14.278
we can say, and carried Her on his back.

00:15:14.479 --> 00:15:16.745
Suddenly he found a little boy.

00:15:16.946 --> 00:15:22.010
It was Shri Krishna himself laughing
at him.

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:24.600
He said: “Why are you laughing at me?”

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:30.020
“Oh my, why are you carrying this old woman
on your back?

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.900
She has no ornaments.” He said: “She’s
the Goddess.”

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.360
He said: “No. She has no ornaments.
She’s wearing nothing.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.170
How can She be the Goddess?”

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:43.420
So you see in India that’s a … proverb
we use.

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:48.189
Somebody, some lady who has, who lives
without any ornaments or anything,

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:51.240
that she’s like the Lanka Parvati.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:57.030
So he was carrying Her to Lanka. And
when he looked at Her up,

00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:02.753
he saw a very old woman without any teeth
you know, laughing at him.

00:16:02.954 --> 00:16:09.436
He got such a fright he threw Her away.
That’s Mahamaya!

00:16:10.448 --> 00:16:14.620
Then the third situation was, he went
and told that:

00:16:14.822 --> 00:16:18.551
“You’d better tell your wife that She’s not
to listen to anybody,

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.800
and you’d better see that you give me
your wife itself.”

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.540
He said: “Alright, She’ll be born in Lanka
and you can marry Her.”

00:16:25.741 --> 00:16:31.540
Her name was Mandodari. Now the great
story goes on like that.

00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:36.654
But this Mandodari was the great worshipper
of Vishnu,

00:16:36.855 --> 00:16:42.500
and at the time when Rama came, you see,
to kill him.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:47.260
All this was organised by Mandodari
Herself.

00:16:47.461 --> 00:16:53.384
She knows, knew that if Shri Rama
kills Ravana

00:16:53.585 --> 00:16:58.702
he will get his liberation from these ideas
about women;

00:16:58.903 --> 00:17:04.139
the way he was running after Sita and doing
all these things.

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:10.013
She actually wanted that something should
happen that he should take another birth,

00:17:10.214 --> 00:17:18.269
and he should get rid of these notions
of looking after beautiful women,

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:22.029
and the way he brought Sitaji there.

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:25.164
She was against it completely, but he
would not listen.

00:17:25.365 --> 00:17:32.363
So the war took place, and in the war he
was killed by Shri Rama.

00:17:32.564 --> 00:17:46.628
All this episode came because of the
unlimited compassion of Shri Shiva.

00:17:47.025 --> 00:17:54.285
His compassion is to look at, looks very
illogical sometimes,

00:17:54.486 --> 00:17:57.024
but there’s a big logic behind it.

00:17:57.225 --> 00:18:01.265
The logic is that whatever He does

00:18:01.466 --> 00:18:11.461
brings forth a kind of a solution of the
problem.

00:18:11.945 --> 00:18:17.945
For example, there was a war on, and
the war was going on,

00:18:18.154 --> 00:18:26.899
and that time there was a problem because
there was one horrible devil

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:32.539
who was given blessings by Shri Shiva

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:36.273
that: “Nobody can kill you.”

00:18:36.474 --> 00:18:44.172
He had given also blessings - as they call
varadan - to another saint,

00:18:44.373 --> 00:18:49.415
who said: “I want to sleep now and nobody
should disturb me.”

00:18:49.616 --> 00:18:51.880
So he was given a blessing:

00:18:52.081 --> 00:18:54.871
“Anybody who disturbs you in your sleep,

00:18:55.072 --> 00:19:01.411
you can just look at that person and that
will be, he’ll be reduced to ashes.”

00:19:01.612 --> 00:19:07.456
So these two now, when the war started,
you see, Shri Krishna thought,

00:19:07.657 --> 00:19:16.320
“Best thing is to kill this devil with
the same blessings

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:20.932
that the saint has got.” So He played

00:19:21.133 --> 00:19:26.437
and He started running away from
the battlefield;

00:19:26.638 --> 00:19:32.325
and that’s why He’s called

00:19:34.338 --> 00:19:38.914
as a warrior who has ran out of the field.

00:19:39.115 --> 00:19:45.740
Ranchordas – the one who runs away
out of the field of battle.

00:19:46.631 --> 00:19:52.027
And when He was running He was wearing
a shawl, Shri Krishna.

00:19:52.228 --> 00:19:55.199
He just stealthily entered into the cave

00:19:55.415 --> 00:20:01.987
and there’s another saint was sleeping and
put His shawl on top of that.

00:20:02.257 --> 00:20:06.439
So when He put the shawl on top of him,

00:20:07.662 --> 00:20:14.582
the gentleman, I mean, the devil who was
following Him, the satanic fellow,

00:20:14.783 --> 00:20:21.152
he reached that place and saw the same
shawl

00:20:21.353 --> 00:20:24.470
and he said: “Oh, so now you are tired

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:27.943
and now you are sleeping here. I’ll put
you right!”

00:20:28.144 --> 00:20:34.302
Without realising who was sleeping and he
pulled the shawl.

00:20:34.503 --> 00:20:40.026
And here the sleeping saint gets up and
looks at him,

00:20:40.227 --> 00:20:43.828
and they say with his third eye he burnt.

00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:48.037
So the solution came in. So the whole
play is like this,

00:20:48.238 --> 00:20:54.871
of three forces going on, just to show
ultimately the truth prevails.

00:20:55.087 --> 00:21:02.070
First is the, Shiva’s compassion, His
goodness, to one side.

00:21:02.271 --> 00:21:10.620
Then the play of Shri Krishna or say
Shri Vishnu of neutralizing it;

00:21:12.028 --> 00:21:24.062
and the third is the play of Brahma who
creates things and who produces things.

00:21:24.263 --> 00:21:27.803
All these three forces are playing,

00:21:28.004 --> 00:21:33.543
just to create an atmosphere for all of us
to feel

00:21:33.744 --> 00:21:38.846
that there is something else is to be done
to our human awareness.

00:21:39.047 --> 00:21:47.590
All they have evolved within us this desire
to seek the truth.

00:21:47.985 --> 00:21:52.608
Now on one side Shiva is extremely
compassionate,

00:21:52.809 --> 00:21:57.422
very kind even to asuras, the rakshasas.

00:21:57.623 --> 00:22:03.716
But on the other side He can be extremely
cruel.

00:22:03.917 --> 00:22:07.747
He can destroy the whole universe.

00:22:07.948 --> 00:22:11.667
If the people are so decadent,

00:22:11.868 --> 00:22:18.804
if the people do not take to spirituality,

00:22:19.948 --> 00:22:24.029
if their innocence is completely lost,

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:29.886
if they do not get detached from all these
wrong identifications

00:22:30.087 --> 00:22:33.267
which are creating problems in this world,

00:22:33.468 --> 00:22:36.646
He destroys the whole universe.

00:22:36.847 --> 00:22:42.326
So as it is He is the spectator of the work
of Adi Shakti.

00:22:42.527 --> 00:22:45.770
He allows Her to do all this work,

00:22:45.984 --> 00:22:50.511
to create human beings, to give them
Realization, do all this.

00:22:50.712 --> 00:22:55.005
But in case He finds Her children,

00:22:55.206 --> 00:23:01.408
people who have been saved by Her,
are misbehaving

00:23:01.609 --> 00:23:05.741
or insulting or in any way destroying
Her work,

00:23:05.942 --> 00:23:12.822
He might get into a temper by which He can
destroy the whole universe.

00:23:13.385 --> 00:23:17.314
But I don’t think now there’s any chance
for Him to do that,

00:23:17.515 --> 00:23:21.384
because we have now Sahaja Yogis all over.

00:23:21.585 --> 00:23:25.960
But what I find amongst Sahaja Yogis
is this

00:23:26.161 --> 00:23:30.519
that some of the Sahaja Yogis grow
very fast.

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:38.179
Steadily, strongly, they achieve their
principle of Shiva Tattwa.

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:46.130
The first achievement shows that from
inside they start getting detached.

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:50.137
Now detachment is not mental. It’s not
mental.

00:23:50.338 --> 00:23:55.990
It is not that we have to take to some sort
of a sanyasa

00:23:56.190 --> 00:24:00.616
or we have to go to Himalayas, give up
our families and all that.

00:24:00.817 --> 00:24:08.950
But the detachment is within oneself. When
that detachment starts working,

00:24:09.151 --> 00:24:16.823
the first sign is that we become joyous,
we become happy.

00:24:17.024 --> 00:24:21.821
Now if you ask anyone: “Why are you
unhappy?”,

00:24:22.022 --> 00:24:28.711
he’ll talk about his wife, maybe his house,
maybe his children,

00:24:28.912 --> 00:24:36.376
maybe his country, maybe society, whatever
it is.

00:24:36.577 --> 00:24:43.357
So he gets absolutely upset, or maybe
very unhappy

00:24:43.558 --> 00:24:47.856
to see things happening around him.

00:24:48.057 --> 00:24:56.140
Now he is a realized soul this unhappiness
is not going to help him.

00:24:56.432 --> 00:25:02.443
What is needed is now to know that you
can correct

00:25:02.644 --> 00:25:10.552
all these ills of the society, of the
family, of the whole country,

00:25:10.753 --> 00:25:15.550
by transforming others, not by feeling bad.

00:25:15.751 --> 00:25:22.711
But while doing that, the main thing that
you should have is a complete detachment.

00:25:22.912 --> 00:25:26.960
I was amazed when I first started Sahaja
Yoga

00:25:27.161 --> 00:25:32.547
how people told me about their own
countrymen, country fellows,

00:25:32.748 --> 00:25:37.295
I was amazed how they told me about their
own religions,

00:25:37.496 --> 00:25:40.715
how wrong things they are doing.

00:25:40.916 --> 00:25:43.685
I didn’t know so much as they told me,

00:25:43.886 --> 00:25:47.483
and I thought that this is a detachment
that has come

00:25:47.684 --> 00:25:51.538
that they can see clearly what’s wrong;

00:25:51.739 --> 00:25:59.750
what’s wrong with my society, with
my people,

00:25:59.951 --> 00:26:05.963
with my relations, with my family, with my
country, with the whole world.

00:26:06.164 --> 00:26:13.635
But is only possible if you are not
identified through any one of them,

00:26:13.836 --> 00:26:16.586
otherwise you will never see the defects.

00:26:16.787 --> 00:26:18.842
You’ll never see what’s wrong with
that person.

00:26:19.043 --> 00:26:22.711
You can never even see the chakras, which
are catching.

00:26:22.912 --> 00:26:28.255
So the first thing that should happen
is detachment.

00:26:28.456 --> 00:26:32.693
Now how to achieve detachment is the point.

00:26:32.894 --> 00:26:36.357
Many people ask me, “Mother, how do you
get detached?”

00:26:36.558 --> 00:26:39.825
Because I am not attached you see, so I’m
already detached.

00:26:40.026 --> 00:26:42.548
I don’t know how to do that way.

00:26:42.749 --> 00:26:48.766
But for you people I would say,
to understand yourself

00:26:48.967 --> 00:26:51.389
you should introspect.

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:57.307
Try to find out to what thing am I
attached. Why am I miserable?

00:26:57.508 --> 00:27:01.367
For whom am I worried? Why should I worry?

00:27:01.568 --> 00:27:05.841
Some things you see which were never
very important,

00:27:06.042 --> 00:27:08.668
they become very important to certain
Sahaja Yogis.

00:27:08.869 --> 00:27:14.510
For example I was told that in the West,
people don’t care

00:27:17.036 --> 00:27:22.389
so much for their children. But as soon
as they get Realization

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:29.509
they just get attached to their children,
like as if with some glue.

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:32.630
They cannot think what is good for
their children.

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:40.065
Everything about children they think is
their primary duty.

00:27:40.265 --> 00:27:46.032
The other day I was surprised when they
told me that it’s the parents

00:27:46.233 --> 00:27:53.200
who want to come after the Birthday Puja.
I was shocked.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.171
I mean, just on the way is Birthday Puja.

00:27:56.372 --> 00:28:02.180
Why should the parents want to come
after that?

00:28:02.697 --> 00:28:05.329
When I told Yogi he said: “Mother,

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:08.629
we’ll be very happy if they are here, and
they should be.

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:11.592
Because it will help the children, it will
help the parents.”

00:28:11.793 --> 00:28:15.264
But the whole now attention goes
to the children,

00:28:15.465 --> 00:28:19.790
that “We must leave the children there
and we must look after them”,

00:28:19.991 --> 00:28:23.351
and that’s the only thing.

00:28:25.787 --> 00:28:31.600
So the attachment to children will
definitely make you do such things,

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:36.430
which are not good, not good for you.

00:28:36.692 --> 00:28:41.784
So this new attachment starts after Sahaja
Yoga, I’ve seen, very common.

00:28:41.985 --> 00:28:45.486
Then another attachment is, say, to your
family.

00:28:45.687 --> 00:28:49.855
Normally there are no such things
in the West.

00:28:50.056 --> 00:28:52.309
People are not attached to their family
much, you see.

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:55.798
They drink, they do all kinds of things.

00:28:55.999 --> 00:29:00.640
Suddenly they become self-realized

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:06.845
and it’s like a boomerang, they come back
to the family

00:29:07.046 --> 00:29:11.440
It is so attached to the family, attached
to the house,

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:15.763
attached to everything. I just can’t
understand.

00:29:15.964 --> 00:29:20.510
If you are becoming the pure Spirit then
you are detached,

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:26.459
because you are just a reflection, but
the reflection of God Almighty.

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:30.795
So all these identifications drop out.

00:29:30.996 --> 00:29:33.499
Now one may say, “How? How to drop it out?”

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:35.169
I’ve never dropped them,

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:38.590
but still I can suggest certain things,
which you can try.

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:42.390
First is meditation.

00:29:42.698 --> 00:29:46.186
You should discover about yourself, what’s
wrong with you,

00:29:46.387 --> 00:29:50.719
which side is catching, is it right or left
side.

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.180
With meditation you can find out.

00:29:53.381 --> 00:29:57.099
Are you attached to money, are you
attached to business,

00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:02.476
are you attached to your family, are you
attached to your country

00:30:02.677 --> 00:30:08.510
in a way which is not Sahaj

00:30:08.711 --> 00:30:11.815
or to your culture, which is not Sahaj?

00:30:12.016 --> 00:30:19.006
Then try to get rid of this attachment
by meditation.

00:30:19.207 --> 00:30:23.343
You know how to get rid of the right
and the left.

00:30:23.544 --> 00:30:27.473
This attachment will show on your
fingertips,

00:30:27.674 --> 00:30:32.432
and you have to see for yourself what
centres you are catching,

00:30:32.633 --> 00:30:38.969
in which way are you in trouble. And then
you can clarify it

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:44.820
very simply by taking a very simple Sahaj
treatment.

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:51.191
I think here we fail, that once we get
attached to something,

00:30:51.392 --> 00:30:53.605
we don’t even think we are getting
attached.

00:30:53.806 --> 00:30:55.489
We think we are doing very great thing

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:59.270
because now we love this person, love
that person,

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:03.600
Shiva’s qualities, the compassion part.

00:31:03.801 --> 00:31:07.731
You start getting attached to people.

00:31:07.932 --> 00:31:12.391
That is no compassion. That is no
compassion of any kind.

00:31:12.592 --> 00:31:16.251
To be attached to any such things is
no compassion,

00:31:16.452 --> 00:31:20.491
and you cannot have compassion of Shiva,

00:31:20.692 --> 00:31:24.018
though people think it is the Shiva’s
compassion that is working within us.

00:31:24.219 --> 00:31:35.466
It’s not, because that compassion is very
pure.

00:31:35.667 --> 00:31:39.942
It is like as I’ve told you many a times,
it’s like the sap in the tree

00:31:40.143 --> 00:31:45.773
which rises and goes to various parts
of the tree,

00:31:45.974 --> 00:31:52.532
and then either it evaporates or goes down
into Mother Earth. It’s not attached.

00:31:52.733 --> 00:31:59.977
If it gets attached to one flower or to one
leaf or to one fruit,

00:32:00.178 --> 00:32:07.251
then the whole tree will suffer and also
the flower will disappear.

00:32:07.452 --> 00:32:16.257
So this kind of attachment to a particular
thing, to a particular idea is not proper.

00:32:16.458 --> 00:32:24.512
In Sahaja Yoga I’ve found people are very
adaptable and understand

00:32:24.713 --> 00:32:29.565
what they should do, but the main thing
is meditation.

00:32:29.766 --> 00:32:33.130
In meditating on your heart, on the Shiva
Tattwa,

00:32:33.339 --> 00:32:37.660
on the principle of Shiva, you can
definitely detach,

00:32:37.861 --> 00:32:44.772
and then the joy will be the maximum,
joy will be the maximum.

00:32:44.973 --> 00:32:48.323
I’ve seen people have interest in, say,
food

00:32:48.524 --> 00:32:55.513
or in clothes or in house, anything.

00:32:55.714 --> 00:33:01.637
You can have interest, you should have
interest, but in that interest

00:33:01.838 --> 00:33:07.780
there should be enlightenment, that you
cannot get attached to it.

00:33:08.185 --> 00:33:15.232
Some people, say, who are say, from South
India, they don’t like North Indian food.

00:33:15.433 --> 00:33:18.959
Those who are from North India don’t like
South Indian.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:23.209
It’s a big problem. I asked the people
in Indian Airlines:

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:25.529
“Why don’t you have some standard food?”

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:28.484
He said: “What is the standard food
of India? Tell me.”

00:33:28.685 --> 00:33:30.554
But it was a question.

00:33:30.755 --> 00:33:34.165
Indians are very particular about
the taste and food.

00:33:34.366 --> 00:33:39.505
So it’s a fact we don’t have any standard
food in India.

00:33:39.706 --> 00:33:42.885
But in the same way, we can say in so many
other ways

00:33:43.086 --> 00:33:52.454
that in the West people run after things,
which are not necessary.

00:33:52.655 --> 00:33:57.396
They do things just out of fashion, or
I don’t know,

00:33:57.597 --> 00:34:00.644
because their personality is not grown-up.

00:34:00.845 --> 00:34:07.693
If your personality is grown up then you
see everything, everything

00:34:07.894 --> 00:34:11.530
from an angle, which is much higher
than others,

00:34:11.731 --> 00:34:14.278
and you don’t get dissolved with others.

00:34:14.479 --> 00:34:20.363
What you know is much higher, much greater
and much more joy giving.

00:34:20.564 --> 00:34:25.144
Now these attachments, people think that
it’s very joy giving.

00:34:25.345 --> 00:34:32.383
If you get a child and if you have say,
a wife and everything, are joy giving.

00:34:32.584 --> 00:34:34.313
It’s a very wrong idea.

00:34:34.514 --> 00:34:39.040
The joy comes from your own source
of your Spirit.

00:34:39.241 --> 00:34:44.110
Whether your husband is good, whether
your children are good or bad,

00:34:44.311 --> 00:34:48.392
whatever they are, they cannot give you
joy.

00:34:48.593 --> 00:34:52.023
It’s only you can enjoy yourself,

00:34:52.224 --> 00:34:58.576
and this is why one becomes very forgiving.

00:34:58.777 --> 00:35:04.457
When nobody can harm you, then whom are
you going to be angry with?

00:35:04.658 --> 00:35:07.600
That is another great quality of Sadashiva,

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.994
is that He is extremely forgiving.

00:35:10.195 --> 00:35:16.128
He goes up to a point, till He destroys
the whole work of Adi Shakti.

00:35:16.329 --> 00:35:19.703
But otherwise He is very, very forgiving,

00:35:19.904 --> 00:35:23.890
and He also is very balanced about it.

00:35:24.091 --> 00:35:27.902
Once the Adi Shakti got very angry with
the whole world,

00:35:28.103 --> 00:35:32.518
was so decadent and all that and She
started destroying everything.

00:35:32.719 --> 00:35:35.760
So He put a little child under Her feet,

00:35:35.961 --> 00:35:39.263
and such a big tongue came out with
such a shock,

00:35:39.464 --> 00:35:42.950
She stopped Her destruction.

00:35:43.151 --> 00:35:47.334
So His ways are such that a person

00:35:47.535 --> 00:35:53.757
who is to develop the Shiva principle
within himself

00:35:53.958 --> 00:35:57.424
should be extremely forgiving.

00:35:57.625 --> 00:36:02.127
I know there are people who are very cruel
and who are very tortur.

00:36:02.328 --> 00:36:07.078
If you cannot bear it, alright, finish
it off.

00:36:07.279 --> 00:36:10.993
I’ll stand by you there; but if you can
bear it

00:36:11.194 --> 00:36:17.541
is better to bear, and undergo this
experience of bearing it,

00:36:17.742 --> 00:36:23.151
because it’s not difficult to bear than
to get out of it.

00:36:23.352 --> 00:36:25.795
For example, a lady came to me, and
she said:

00:36:25.996 --> 00:36:28.894
“I’m going to divorce my husband.”
I said: “Why?”

00:36:29.095 --> 00:36:32.953
“Because he comes home very late and
I get very little of him.”

00:36:33.154 --> 00:36:39.528
But I said, “When you divorce you’ll not
get him at all! What’s the logic?

00:36:39.729 --> 00:36:43.751
At least now you see him, whatever it is,
whenever, whatever the time is there.

00:36:43.952 --> 00:36:49.369
But this is no solution. If you divorce him
you’ll never see him.

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:52.403
So what’s the use of such a divorce?”

00:36:52.604 --> 00:36:58.743
So many things like that can be understood
once you are a detached person,

00:36:58.944 --> 00:37:01.914
that you are not to be attached
to anything.

00:37:02.115 --> 00:37:07.612
Now who can aggress you if you are not
attached to anyone?

00:37:07.813 --> 00:37:11.855
Nobody can. Only thing when you feel

00:37:12.056 --> 00:37:15.815
that you have to protest, you should,
but with detachment.

00:37:16.016 --> 00:37:23.588
In protest also is important to absolutely
to have a complete detachment.

00:37:23.789 --> 00:37:30.938
Now the main problem before us today
is something else:

00:37:31.139 --> 00:37:36.889
is that we all have to ascend,

00:37:37.563 --> 00:37:45.549
and ascend with equal strength.

00:37:46.271 --> 00:37:55.160
There’s a story about some birds who were
caught in a net,

00:37:55.361 --> 00:38:00.564
so they decided that we should get out
of this net, and they tried.

00:38:00.765 --> 00:38:06.193
Everybody tried to get out, but nobody
individually could work it out.

00:38:06.394 --> 00:38:11.145
So they all decided to fly together, “One,
two, three, go!”,

00:38:11.346 --> 00:38:15.134
and they took all that net with them.

00:38:15.335 --> 00:38:25.919
And they said, then they requested the rats
that “Please come and cut our net.”

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.243
And they were freed.

00:38:28.444 --> 00:38:32.399
So if it can happen between the rats
and the birds,

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:34.902
why not between us?

00:38:35.103 --> 00:38:40.056
So in collectivity, you’ll be amazed,

00:38:40.257 --> 00:38:45.419
in the collectivity how we could be helpful
and joyous with each other.

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:48.273
Now say something is wrong

00:38:48.474 --> 00:38:52.834
with your mother, father, sisters,
somebody, doesn’t matter.

00:38:53.035 --> 00:38:57.760
After all you have the ocean of joy here
with the collectivity,

00:38:57.961 --> 00:38:59.936
and your problems can be solved

00:39:00.137 --> 00:39:04.360
if collectively, if you want to solve
your problem.

00:39:04.561 --> 00:39:07.817
So we have to depend on the collectivity,

00:39:08.018 --> 00:39:11.424
very much to be one with the collective.

00:39:11.625 --> 00:39:16.898
I feel once you jump into the sea of Sahaj,

00:39:17.099 --> 00:39:19.925
the joy itself draws you together.

00:39:20.126 --> 00:39:23.596
Meeting each other is such a joyous thing!

00:39:23.797 --> 00:39:26.407
We have had so many experiences of that,

00:39:26.608 --> 00:39:31.445
of Sahaja Yogis who have told me how
happy they were to find

00:39:31.646 --> 00:39:37.910
Sahaja Yogis somewhere out of the blue,
and how they felt happy.

00:39:38.111 --> 00:39:48.003
So this tie between the Sahaja Yogis is
really the most joyous channel,

00:39:48.204 --> 00:39:55.319
and that is what is the source we should
say, of our becoming one together.

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:59.525
Once you start enjoying each other…

00:40:00.564 --> 00:40:04.537
I’ve told you once a story of a great
poet in India

00:40:04.738 --> 00:40:09.428
whose name was Namdeva, who was a tailor.

00:40:09.629 --> 00:40:17.335
And there was another one who was
a… potter.

00:40:17.536 --> 00:40:20.464
Sometimes I miss out in English words.

00:40:20.665 --> 00:40:30.557
This potter was another poet and he was
called as Gorakumbhar.

00:40:30.827 --> 00:40:33.876
So when Namdeva went to meet him –

00:40:34.077 --> 00:40:37.308
a saint only feels like meeting a saint –

00:40:37.509 --> 00:40:45.691
looked at him, and he just stood back and
then he said a beautiful couplet.

00:40:45.892 --> 00:40:52.467
He says that: “I came here to see the form,
formless Chaitanya,

00:40:52.668 --> 00:40:57.664
but here the Chaitanya is in the form” -

00:40:57.895 --> 00:41:00.738
‘Nirgunachah beti allo sagunashi’ -

00:41:00.938 --> 00:41:05.819
“I came to see the formless, to see
the vibrations,

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:10.597
but here the, it is in the form that
I see it.”

00:41:10.798 --> 00:41:15.032
Only a saint can say this to another saint.

00:41:15.233 --> 00:41:19.079
This kind of appreciation, this subtle
appreciation

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:25.493
is only possible between the two saints,
or between the many.

00:41:25.694 --> 00:41:29.372
They don’t see he was kneading the clay;

00:41:29.573 --> 00:41:35.395
he was wearing a dirty dhoti, doing
that work.

00:41:35.596 --> 00:41:37.586
He never saw all these things.

00:41:37.787 --> 00:41:40.852
He never saw his body, face or anything,

00:41:41.053 --> 00:41:48.506
but he saw that the Divinity personified
in him.

00:41:49.966 --> 00:41:55.019
This sensitivity of feeling for other
Sahaja Yogis

00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:59.856
should really develop within you.

00:42:00.057 --> 00:42:05.457
Then you won’t care for nonsensical,
superficial things,

00:42:05.658 --> 00:42:11.354
and this is one of the great principles
of Shiva.

00:42:11.555 --> 00:42:17.025
He doesn’t bother. Now see, His hair
are all matted up,

00:42:17.226 --> 00:42:23.263
He sits on a fast-moving bull with both
the legs like that

00:42:23.464 --> 00:42:27.657
going for His wedding. Can you imagine?

00:42:28.253 --> 00:42:31.472
And all His friends, all His followers

00:42:31.681 --> 00:42:36.705
are somebody has only one eye, another
has only one hand,

00:42:36.906 --> 00:42:39.644
one is bent like that,

00:42:39.845 --> 00:42:47.908
because for Him the outside personality
doesn’t matter.

00:42:48.109 --> 00:42:53.694
What matters is the spirituality. Whether
you have one eye

00:42:54.003 --> 00:42:57.959
or whether you have a crooked body makes
no difference to Him.

00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:03.407
To Him all of them are His own people,

00:43:03.608 --> 00:43:09.208
because nothing that is superficial
attracts His attention,

00:43:09.414 --> 00:43:13.297
but the divinity in a person.

00:43:13.498 --> 00:43:18.552
We have so many ways of understanding
His principle,

00:43:18.753 --> 00:43:22.308
because He is all-pervading.

00:43:22.509 --> 00:43:29.905
If you feel compassion for someone
it works. It definitely works.

00:43:30.106 --> 00:43:41.011
Recently there was a case of some sort
of a, incurable disease in Mexico.

00:43:41.212 --> 00:43:43.025
And the lady, who was Mexican,

00:43:43.225 --> 00:43:46.405
who was working in the UN, she’s still
working in UN,

00:43:46.606 --> 00:43:52.571
she wrote to me two letters, that “Mother,
I’m going to lose my son

00:43:52.772 --> 00:43:59.078
because he has this horrible disease.”
I mean, just she wrote to me.

00:43:59.279 --> 00:44:03.535
I just felt such compassion for her,

00:44:03.736 --> 00:44:08.518
because she wrote a letter, which brought
tears to my eyes.

00:44:08.719 --> 00:44:14.183
And imagine, those tears have cured
that boy!

00:44:17.681 --> 00:44:22.683
(Shri Mataji speaks aside: “It has fallen.”
Then Hindi)

00:44:27.229 --> 00:44:30.301
Has cured that boy completely,

00:44:30.502 --> 00:44:37.794
and she wrote me a letter of, thanking
and all.

00:44:37.995 --> 00:44:43.110
I was amazed, because my compassion
is not mental.

00:44:43.311 --> 00:44:49.171
It just works, it’s just there, just flows
and works it out.

00:44:49.372 --> 00:44:53.207
In the same way you can also become that.

00:44:53.408 --> 00:44:56.290
I want you to have all my powers.

00:44:56.491 --> 00:44:59.642
But first is the compassion.

00:44:59.843 --> 00:45:03.161
And a Sahaja Yogi cannot ill-treat another
person, anyone.

00:45:03.362 --> 00:45:06.959
Whether he’s a Sahaja Yogi or not a Sahaja
Yogi, that’s not important.

00:45:07.167 --> 00:45:12.792
But nobody can aggress other Sahaja Yogis.

00:45:12.993 --> 00:45:22.443
If you say even he’s a non Sahaja Yogi,
Sahaja Yogis should never aggress.

00:45:22.644 --> 00:45:29.181
That’s not a sign of a Sahaja Yogi. Sahaja
Yogi is different.

00:45:29.382 --> 00:45:32.200
Like the other day somebody said, I said:
“You are very hot-tempered.”

00:45:32.401 --> 00:45:36.450
“Yes, yes, I am, when somebody provokes
me.”

00:45:36.651 --> 00:45:39.732
I said: “Everybody when he’s provoked
only gets angry.

00:45:39.933 --> 00:45:46.898
Only the mad are such who do not get angry
when they are provoked, you see.

00:45:47.099 --> 00:45:51.124
So if you get angry when you are provoked,
is nothing so great.

00:45:51.325 --> 00:45:54.406
Everybody gets angry like that, when you
are provoked.

00:45:54.607 --> 00:45:57.957
But if you say that if you are not provoked
then you will not get angry,

00:45:58.158 --> 00:46:00.754
that sort of a state is very different.”

00:46:00.955 --> 00:46:10.046
So what I find, that in the whole
atmosphere of today

00:46:10.247 --> 00:46:19.590
in the modern times, there’s a big struggle
going on,

00:46:19.971 --> 00:46:24.247
which is not Shiva’s culture.

00:46:24.476 --> 00:46:32.777
Shiva’s culture is the, I should say,
the Sahaj culture.

00:46:33.082 --> 00:46:40.807
If you are Sahaja Yogis you should have
compassion in you,

00:46:41.149 --> 00:46:46.119
understanding of others’ feelings;

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:51.976
and also should have readiness to look
after

00:46:52.177 --> 00:46:56.099
not only Sahaja Yogis, also non Sahaja
Yogis,

00:46:56.300 --> 00:47:00.349
then your compassion will become effective.

00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:08.759
Now as you know today, the biggest problem
of today’s civilisation

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:12.878
is the Western culture has gone to dogs.

00:47:13.079 --> 00:47:15.344
They are going, I mean when you read
the newspaper

00:47:15.544 --> 00:47:18.368
you are shocked the way things are
happening.

00:47:18.569 --> 00:47:23.643
I don’t know how many will realise it
before their destruction.

00:47:23.844 --> 00:47:26.162
It’s really self-destructing.

00:47:26.363 --> 00:47:34.461
On one side this is the self-indulgent and
permissive society, which is working.

00:47:34.662 --> 00:47:43.107
Now on the other side I find the Islamic
culture is trying to oppose it.

00:47:43.308 --> 00:47:47.074
That’s correct, their trying to oppose it
is correct,

00:47:47.275 --> 00:47:51.062
but the way they are opposing is creating
problems.

00:47:51.263 --> 00:47:54.898
If you oppress somebody – “Don’t do this,
don’t do that” –

00:47:55.099 --> 00:47:58.743
then they’ll do it much more. I’ll give
an example,

00:47:58.944 --> 00:48:06.276
that if you go into the north of India
the culture is more Islamic,

00:48:06.477 --> 00:48:12.093
and the people are very licentious and
all the time looking at women.

00:48:12.294 --> 00:48:17.333
Not all, but many; though they are say,
they are Hindus or they say this and that,

00:48:17.534 --> 00:48:20.806
but still they have all these bad habits,

00:48:21.007 --> 00:48:24.367
which have come from Islamic suppression.

00:48:24.568 --> 00:48:28.252
When a woman is completely covered

00:48:28.453 --> 00:48:32.271
and nobody can see her, they become much
more curious.

00:48:32.472 --> 00:48:37.286
I have some people who came to Bombay
and somebody was travelling with me,

00:48:37.487 --> 00:48:39.749
and he was looking at every woman
on the street.

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:44.239
I tell, I said: “Your neck will break now,
the way you are going on.”

00:48:44.454 --> 00:48:46.398
But is a common practice there.

00:48:46.599 --> 00:48:49.696
Not only that, but this curiosity goes
too far

00:48:49.897 --> 00:48:52.767
and people can become extremely immoral,

00:48:52.968 --> 00:48:55.700
just like we are in the West.

00:48:55.901 --> 00:49:04.496
So the suppression of your desires is
also wrong.

00:49:04.697 --> 00:49:10.430
Also this culture, which outwardly
suppresses,

00:49:10.631 --> 00:49:14.911
but inwardly people are very immoral.

00:49:15.112 --> 00:49:20.354
Once I was travelling from Riyadh to London
and I went off to sleep.

00:49:20.555 --> 00:49:24.814
When I got up, I saw some other people
sitting there all very nicely dressed up

00:49:25.015 --> 00:49:30.479
with short skirts and women with –
all the bow ties and this and that -

00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:33.146
so I asked the air hostess, I said: “Did we
stop somewhere?”

00:49:33.347 --> 00:49:35.163
She said: “No, no, we have been going
directly.”

00:49:35.372 --> 00:49:38.922
I said: “Then who are these people?”
“Same.”

00:49:39.123 --> 00:49:41.861
“They are so much changed!” I mean,
I was surprised

00:49:42.062 --> 00:49:45.571
that they were wearing such long, these
chador and all that,

00:49:45.772 --> 00:49:49.932
and now here they are with all these
funny dresses.

00:49:50.133 --> 00:49:53.873
I couldn’t understand. So that’s what
happens.

00:49:54.074 --> 00:50:00.374
The curiosity created by suppression also
is not helpful.

00:50:00.575 --> 00:50:02.517
In Sahaja Yoga there’s no question
of suppression.

00:50:02.718 --> 00:50:06.641
You become innocent, just become innocent.

00:50:06.842 --> 00:50:09.517
That is the principle of Shiva.

00:50:09.718 --> 00:50:14.998
This Sahaj culture is in the centre. It has
neither too much of licentiousness

00:50:15.199 --> 00:50:19.049
nor too much of suppression, but it is
in the centre,

00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:25.246
which is the, Shiva’s greatest principle is
to be innocent.

00:50:25.447 --> 00:50:29.565
And this innocence just shines in you,
I have seen it.

00:50:29.766 --> 00:50:32.620
You people, whatever you might have
done before,

00:50:32.821 --> 00:50:37.721
but I see you are so pure. You don’t have
these stupid ideas

00:50:37.922 --> 00:50:44.619
of behaving in a manner that is so Western.

00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:48.996
Also, so many Islamic people I’ve seen who
have come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:50:49.197 --> 00:50:53.207
have become very, very Sahaj

00:50:53.408 --> 00:50:57.457
and are leading a very good life.

00:50:57.658 --> 00:51:03.004
We have some Iranians who sent me
letters of their confessions,

00:51:03.205 --> 00:51:06.807
and I was shocked. I never read them
because it was too much for me.

00:51:07.008 --> 00:51:12.035
And now I find them to be the most moral
people that we have.

00:51:12.236 --> 00:51:17.296
So going to one extreme is wrong, or
to another is wrong.

00:51:17.497 --> 00:51:22.668
But to be in the centre, in the Sahaj is
the best way to understand

00:51:22.869 --> 00:51:27.646
what is so important for life is morality.

00:51:27.847 --> 00:51:30.960
And that comes from your innocence.

00:51:31.161 --> 00:51:38.676
And that is the quality of, of course,
Shri Ganesha, who is the Son of Shiva,

00:51:38.877 --> 00:51:47.599
but is emitted through the innocence
of Shri Shiva.

00:51:48.385 --> 00:51:56.043
Now I think in next lecture of Shiva
I’ll talk about innocence to you,

00:51:56.244 --> 00:52:01.302
but for this one you have to understand
the detachment,

00:52:01.503 --> 00:52:04.941
the detachment that should evolve within.

00:52:05.142 --> 00:52:07.817
It cannot be forced, but through meditation

00:52:08.018 --> 00:52:13.966
you can develop that detachment within you,
which will be really joy giving.

00:52:14.167 --> 00:52:17.366
So many qualities of Shiva can be
described,

00:52:17.574 --> 00:52:23.522
and I think in so many lectures I have told
you about Him.

00:52:23.723 --> 00:52:30.699
I have to just say that you should have
also collective meditation

00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:35.186
in your ashrams. Will be a good idea

00:52:35.387 --> 00:52:39.281
if you can try collective meditation,
will be nice.

00:52:39.482 --> 00:52:42.027
But you don’t have to give vibrations
to anyone.

00:52:42.228 --> 00:52:45.523
You don’t have to look after the chakras
of others.

00:52:45.724 --> 00:52:48.676
You just bother, yourself, what’s wrong
with you.

00:52:48.877 --> 00:52:54.016
And now whatever is the solution for your
ascent you should do it,

00:52:54.217 --> 00:53:01.748
because the responsibility of the whole
world rests on Sahaja Yogis.

00:53:01.949 --> 00:53:06.562
This you know, that there’s no way out
without Sahaja Yoga.

00:53:06.763 --> 00:53:11.835
To save humanity from all kinds
of problems,

00:53:12.036 --> 00:53:15.071
Sahaja Yoga has come on this earth.

00:53:15.272 --> 00:53:20.924
So it is your responsibility to keep
yourself in proper shape,

00:53:21.125 --> 00:53:23.214
as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

00:53:23.415 --> 00:53:26.708
get rid of your left and get rid of your
right,

00:53:26.909 --> 00:53:32.723
and then to spread Sahaja Yoga, not
by bombastic words

00:53:32.924 --> 00:53:37.141
or aggressiveness, but with love and
compassion.

00:53:37.342 --> 00:53:40.821
I’m sure we have done a lot, we have
achieved a lot,

00:53:41.022 --> 00:53:44.689
but there are still some points here
and there

00:53:44.890 --> 00:53:48.971
which is a very unpleasant task for me
to correct them.

00:53:49.172 --> 00:53:53.691
But whatever it is I have to say that
it’s working,

00:53:53.892 --> 00:53:57.775
and everybody should look at themselves

00:53:57.976 --> 00:54:00.881
and feel happy from where they have
come here,

00:54:01.082 --> 00:54:03.010
and how far we have to go.

00:54:03.211 --> 00:54:05.933
May God bless you all.
