Sahasrara Puja – “The Ghost of Materialism”
3rd May 1987

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:39.970
Thredbo, Australia

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:46.730
Today is a very great day for all the Sahaja
yogis.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:01:08.460
It was a long time back that I desired Sahasrara
should be opened out, but waiting for a right

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.340
time.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:26.470
It was important to do it at the right time.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:38.869
A boy in Aurangabad, quite young, asked Me
a question, “Mother, this all-pervading

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:53.890
Power of Brahmachaitanya is beyond senses,
you cannot feel it through senses.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:01.959
How is it we are now feeling it through our
senses?”

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:08.450
This is the question he asked, and I ask you
the same question.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:23.990
Before this, those people who got realization
could not talk about it in the way you can

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.730
tell people, that you can feel it on your
senses.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:38.280
They could not explain, they could not put
it into experience.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:56.129
Just what they did was to tell them in words,
words which were telling about something – like

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:03.329
the taste of mango, unless and until you eat
the mango how will you know the taste?

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:08.239
By just knowing about “it’s wonderful,
it’s great, it’s fantastic,” still you

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:15.459
have not tasted the mango.

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.560
So what has happened now, was the question.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.739
Another thing was that these people got so
fed up, like Gyaneshwara at the age of twenty-one,

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.130
he took a samadhi.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:38.810
He went into a room and closed the doors and
settled down there, and he died there.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.510
All of them – even Christ got Himself crucified.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:55.920
Because they could tell a parable, they could
tell a simile, but what had happened to them

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:09.001
that they could not explain, and they felt
so sad and so frustrated.

00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:13.840
In a way they finished their life very early.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:25.400
This was the question.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:05:00.250
So what was the secret, can any one of you
tell Me?

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:17.000
The answer is simple, but it’s difficult
to digest.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:31.300
The answer is that all these incarnations
who came on this Earth were part of the Sahasrara,

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:42.979
were part of the Brahmachaitanya, were part
of the Adi Shakti.

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:52.340
They came on this Earth, gave realization
to some people who were excellent, good people

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:59.820
who had no problems; as if they came out of
the ocean of love and took all of them to

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.590
the ocean of love, to enjoy that ocean.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:10.240
As Kabira has said that “When a drop becomes
the ocean, what can I say?”

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:17.990
(“Jub mast hue, phir kya bole?”)

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.240
So many of them took to mauna, that is silence.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:33.250
They disappeared, they got dissolved completely
into the ocean of love.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:41.740
But you did not get dissolved.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:54.159
Something special has happened to you, that
the whole of Brahmachaitanya, the whole ocean

00:06:54.159 --> 00:07:10.780
has taken the form of a cloud – that’s
Adi Shakti – and has come on this Earth

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:32.789
to shower the chaitanya on you people, enrich
you, nurture you, develop you, by manifesting

00:07:32.789 --> 00:07:43.830
the love in such a manner that you have entered
into the body of the Adi Shakti.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:49.530
So like one pitcher which is in the River
Ganges, you are like a cell in the body of

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:54.909
the Adi Shakti.

00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:58.610
Your entity, your personality is preserved.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:08.530
Despite that you feel the Brahmachaitanya
through your senses and you can give realizations

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:12.439
to others, but you are in the body of the
Adi Shakti.

00:08:12.439 --> 00:08:21.630
As long as you are in the body of Adi Shakti
you can do all that.

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:25.069
This is the greatest thing that has happened.

00:08:25.069 --> 00:08:32.240
The whole of the Sahasrara has opened out
with all the seven peethas of all the deities,

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.560
who are just part and parcel of it.

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:46.650
The whole of it has come in the form of a
Mother who is humble, who is deceptive, illusive,

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:50.890
who is Mahamaya.

00:08:50.890 --> 00:09:00.990
It’s the greatest thing that could happen
to human beings and to the whole universe,

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:09.130
that now you can get your realization, you
can give realizations to others, you can understand

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:16.870
through your senses, through your logic what
is vibrations, what it does.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:28.610
Just like the proof is here: all the flowers
were dead last night, finished with the heat

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.560
of the people who were carrying them.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:37.680
And then I just put some vibrated water on
them, and you see how they are.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:46.730
Brahmachaitanya has revived them, but their
personality is there, they are all vibrated,

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:49.589
and they are looking so fresh and beautiful.

00:09:49.589 --> 00:10:00.250
Same thing with you, you all look so fresh
and beautiful, anybody can make out a Sahaja

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:01.580
yogi.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:07.790
Under these circumstances one has to understand
that there are certain limitations which you

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.010
have to observe.

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:12.709
First of all, I have taken you in My body.

00:10:12.709 --> 00:10:24.829
A foreign thing has to go in the body and
it has to be looked after, nurtured.

00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:35.980
But if you become troublesome, then you’ll
be thrown out, I can’t bear you.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:40.560
Some people are extremely troublesome.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:50.440
They do not meditate, they have their own
ideas about meditation, they do not develop

00:10:50.440 --> 00:11:03.250
themselves, they do not mature, they live
in the past or in the future, and such people

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:04.250
are troublesome.

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:11.760
A simple thing I’d requested you all, to
put some ghee in the nose, which is a very

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.630
simple thing but is very important.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:25.610
You all suffer from a very bad Hamsa, and
one of the things that is a symptom in a AIDS

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:28.510
case is a bad Hamsa.

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:42.370
You’ll be vulnerable to AIDS – and a small
thing like that is not observed.

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:51.680
It has to be a religious obligation that you
must listen to Me, whatever I say.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.720
Actually you must obey Me.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:03.880
My hand obeys Me, My fingers obey Me, My feet
obey Me; what about you, who are raised to

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:20.760
the great dignity and the great position of
being the yogis in the body of the Adi Shakti,

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:34.980
and they are acting as cells in My body?

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:43.820
First and foremost thing is, to do this kind
of a venture, to put all kinds of things in

00:12:43.820 --> 00:13:04.360
your body is a very daring thing, and the
process is also very hazardous.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:21.060
This has to be achieved with great patience,
love, compassion and above all, hard labor.

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:30.949
This has to be regarded as the greatest thing,
that Sahasrara was opened by Me.

00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:40.190
Of course I am the master of Sahasrara, I
am the master of all the chakras, but also

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:45.149
I’m beyond Sahasrara, much beyond it.

00:13:45.149 --> 00:13:53.009
If that is the situation, you should be careful
about your Sahasrara – that is Me – and

00:13:53.009 --> 00:14:03.060
looking after your own heart which is the
Brahmarandra peetha here, which opens out

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:06.759
ultimately when you get your realization.

00:14:06.759 --> 00:14:15.790
Sahaja Yoga is spreading everywhere horizontally;
vertically it must also spread.

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:24.040
And there, if you really have proper understanding
of what I am, Sahasrara should be absolutely

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.449
clearcut.

00:14:25.449 --> 00:14:33.730
And to keep Sahasrara clearcut you must listen
to whatever I have told you, obey it as absolutely

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:43.279
a ordained thing.

00:14:43.279 --> 00:14:47.120
To keep the Sahasrara clean is to open your
heart.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:55.149
If your hearts are not open, how will I fill
it up with My love?

00:14:55.149 --> 00:15:00.610
Open your heart to your fellow yogis and yoginis.

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:07.350
Don’t get worried about what has happened
in the past, don’t get worried about what

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:14.399
has happened in your life as far as your relationships
are concerned.

00:15:14.399 --> 00:15:20.920
Such things won’t happen now in Sahaja Yoga,
they cannot happen.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:27.029
It has been worked out that way, it cannot
happen.

00:15:27.029 --> 00:15:31.850
If this hand is paining, the other hand is
there to help it out.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:37.500
You’re not alone, you are in the body of
the collective being.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:46.019
If there are stupid people, if there are idiotic
people, Sahaja Yoga is not meant for such

00:15:46.019 --> 00:15:52.550
people – in Sanskrit language they are called
as “mudhahs.”

00:15:52.550 --> 00:16:01.290
Neither this is meant for people who are over-smart
and trying to cheat themselves – intelligence

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:13.519
has that capacity – and to indulge into
things which are not Sahaj.

00:16:13.519 --> 00:16:18.079
Slowly you will find your vibrations will
disappear, you’ll become sick, you’ll

00:16:18.079 --> 00:16:26.000
have problems and you’ll be in trouble.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:38.160
This is not a kind of a warning but a request,
because you are in My body, and whenever

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:48.610
anybody tries to be troublesome in My body
I have to bear it up, and suffer a lot.

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:59.360
It’s a funny type of a crucifixion when
every moment you are hanged onto a cross by

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:05.690
anyone who wants to do it.

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:14.700
Sahaja yogis have all the laws in their hands
to torture My life, to trouble Me if they

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:27.459
want to; but they have also such a capacity,
such a caliber, such a potential that they

00:17:27.459 --> 00:17:32.170
can reside in My heart forever.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:38.460
Open your hearts, that’s the thing I will
say.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:43.880
Now we have to see what keeps our hearts closed.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:53.740
Firstly it keeps our heart in a binding, the
fear of the past.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:18:01.810
In the past if you have done anything wrong,
in the past we have had bad experiences of

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:05.140
people, we are very frightened.

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:14.450
I’ve seen, I’m surprised, I’ve seen
it Myself that in England when we were staying

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:24.420
– it was that day unluckily or luckily it
was snowing for the first time, and we were

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.860
shifting, so I had gone out.

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:35.289
And when I came back I saw a lady and a little
baby in a pram, standing at the door and talking

00:18:35.289 --> 00:18:36.289
to some lady.

00:18:36.289 --> 00:18:44.140
The other lady was just talking through a
little opening in the door, because there

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.049
was a chain on.

00:18:46.049 --> 00:18:53.770
Then I went out and came back after half-an-hour,
and I saw the same thing.

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:59.929
The lady was still standing in the snow, and
this lady was talking to her through a chink.

00:18:59.929 --> 00:19:02.400
I was surprised.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:07.700
What is this going like “Midsummer’s Night’s
Dream,” these people are talking to each

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.950
other – horrible!

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:16.980
What was it that was frightening to this lady
inside the room – what this lady would have

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.160
done with the child, who had come to her door?

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.910
What was there to be so frightened of?

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:31.309
Because of the ego within yourself: you have
frightened others, you have tortured others,

00:19:31.309 --> 00:19:38.990
you have dominated others, you have done all
these things, so there is fear in your mind

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:43.970
that others may do the same thing to you.

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:48.230
Or what is there to be so much frightened,
to lock your doors to everyone who comes to

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:53.380
your house?

00:19:53.380 --> 00:20:01.100
Secondly, maybe you might have been tortured
by someone or troubled by someone, so your

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.840
heart is closed, you can’t open heart to
others.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:09.070
People just don’t talk, they just keep “mum.”

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:11.510
What has happened?

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:15.770
Just like a dead body moving about.

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:25.899
Supposing I was like this, who would have
told you the secrets of Sahaja Yoga and Sahasrara?

00:20:25.899 --> 00:20:32.440
So this kind of a nature comes from people
who are frightened in the past perhaps, or

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:39.480
they might have frightened people with their
bad Vishuddhi.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:48.390
Aggressiveness is one of the qualities in
the West, and that also is inherited by you

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:49.570
people.

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:53.950
As soon as you put them onto something, they
become aggressive.

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:57.630
I can’t bear it within Myself.

00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:06.539
Supposing I have some sort of a medicine that
makes some cells very aggressive, then what

00:21:06.539 --> 00:21:07.539
happens?

00:21:07.539 --> 00:21:11.169
Ultimately I become a patient of cancer.

00:21:11.169 --> 00:21:24.480
An aggressive cell is called as the malignant
cell, and such a cell cannot give you proper

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:32.310
attention, cannot give you proper depth, but
you become nothing but a malignant cell, a

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:36.680
cell which is creating a cancer.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:41.080
And such a person creates cancer among Sahaja
yogis.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:51.220
I’ve heard horrible stories about how some
women, some men have become aggressive.

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:55.690
With a little position they get, immediately
they become aggressive.

00:21:55.690 --> 00:22:04.940
Say somebody is a wife of a organizer, or
a so-called leader’s, then she thinks she

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:14.100
is nothing but a prime minister or something
– or her husband becomes something.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:19.660
This aggressiveness adds to the aggressiveness
of another person.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.480
So then reaction starts.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:25.780
One says something, the another says something;
we become reactionaries.

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:31.210
We haven’t got something of our own, that
we should be reactionaries?

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:39.320
There should be no reaction to anything, because
we have something of our own.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:45.499
Why should we react to something, whatever
people are doing to us or have done to us?

00:22:45.499 --> 00:22:46.929
– it’s finished.

00:22:46.929 --> 00:22:49.070
Open your hearts.

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:55.730
That’s why when you came to India, I think
you must have noticed that in the Indian heart

00:22:55.730 --> 00:23:06.169
there is nothing like an anger for say, for
English or for Portuguese, or for anybody

00:23:06.169 --> 00:23:08.500
who has dominated them.

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:15.620
They have so much love and affection and respect,
and they see that what good you have done

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:16.770
to them.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:24.410
Like some barristers came to India and they
visited some high courts, and they had holiday

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:35.750
for one day to celebrate the visit of these
British lawyers and barristers.

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:44.310
But if you go to England they will beat you,
throw you out.

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:50.580
This aggressiveness has to go from your heart,
it has to get out of it.

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:59.450
There’s no place in My body for aggressive
people, no place at all.

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:07.980
I have not aggressed you, and you shouldn’t
aggress Me.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:12.390
If you aggress any Sahaja yogi, you are aggressing
Me.

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:16.170
But when it comes to others, they won’t
aggress others.

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:24.429
Like a bad husband will aggress his wife,
but not other people.

00:24:24.429 --> 00:24:28.200
So those who are non-Sahaja yogis, they do
not aggress them.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:36.799
That’s a very important part of Sahasrara,
because ego covers a great part of Sahasrara,

00:24:36.799 --> 00:24:45.549
and if your Sahasrara is covered with this
ego business, how can I help you and how can

00:24:45.549 --> 00:24:47.460
I help Myself?

00:24:47.460 --> 00:25:00.950
Now so many of you are in My body, just imagine,
circulating fast; and most of them are fighting

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:04.710
to be in My heart, but they are settling in
My ego.

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:13.980
Well, I am egoless, because I have no reactions.

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:17.000
If you have no reaction you cannot develop
ego.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.720
I’ve no reactions, I’m reactionless.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:37.700
I am in My own peace and glory, trying to
work out Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:51.210
I do not react to anything, but your reactions
trouble Me because you are within Me.

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:58.070
Then the second part is the fear that comes
from childhood.

00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:06.610
I do not know about Americans, but so many
Americans who came to Me were half-mad, cracked

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:11.880
people, absolutely cracked in the head, nothing
normal about them.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:16.580
Either they will not talk – if they talk
they talk irrelevantly, you don’t know what

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:18.020
they are talking about.

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.191
Same with the French.

00:26:20.191 --> 00:26:30.440
French were mad much before anybody was mad
in this world, I think; very cracky people

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:38.240
you see, very difficult, it’s absolutely
can’t understand, everything upside-down.

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:49.510
When you blame our Indian telephone, you must
know they were made by French.

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:59.580
I always say that in Pune we have got the
telephone just to see, because it is called

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:05.671
as “Punya Patnam” – means the, is the
“city of punyas” – and only God can

00:27:05.671 --> 00:27:13.760
listen to this telephone, but even God cannot!

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:24.630
So this kind of a crackedness, or this what
you call this madness, aggressive madness,

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:40.260
comes from ego going to the level of super-ego;
and they get first of all “what’s wrong?”

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:47.059
When they talk you feel they are fighting,
and these are love talks, “romantic” they

00:27:47.059 --> 00:27:50.950
say, and we feel they are fighting.

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:59.799
And then after some time the aggressiveness
is very apparent, and then it becomes as if

00:27:59.799 --> 00:28:04.490
they are off their heads, absolutely off their
heads.

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:08.750
And it’s very common with Americans, very
common.

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:18.420
You can’t find Americans when they are talking,
any good speaker, who doesn’t have twitches

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:25.059
on his faces, on his body, everywhere, because
so many nerves have been already strained

00:28:25.059 --> 00:28:38.830
with this kind of “what’s wrong?” business
– going to the other extreme of deciding

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:41.320
everything for yourself.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:56.429
And the thing behind is a ghost, I should
say, a very big ghost, and which is not in

00:28:56.429 --> 00:28:59.940
the past or the future, but in the present.

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:02.059
And that ghost I call it as materialism.

00:29:02.059 --> 00:29:13.240
Materialism – it’s a ghost, it’s a horrible
devil that has come onto the heads of Americans,

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:19.390
and from them to all of us.

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:23.860
This materialism is a horrible stuff.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:37.250
It’s so ridiculous, shameful, doesn’t
even suit a human person; even a dog would

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:49.690
hate such a materialism, to what level human
beings have gone.

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:56.159
This materialism makes a person absolutely
shameless.

00:29:56.159 --> 00:30:06.890
A lady would not mind asking another lady,
“By the way, have you got my spoons with

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:07.890
you?”

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:11.610
There’s no shame in it.

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:22.350
When we were small we were told in India – I
mean, that’s our culture – that if somebody’s

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:30.480
pin is in your house you should preserve it
and return it, but even if your diamond is

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.929
lost with somebody, never ask for it.

00:30:33.929 --> 00:30:39.200
Is not good manners.

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:49.820
What is more valuable is not the diamond,
is the relationship, is the friendship, and

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:54.370
the emotions of human beings to be respected.

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:56.370
How can you ask?

00:30:56.370 --> 00:31:00.730
If there was a diamond they would have found
it and would have given it to you, but if

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:07.830
there is no asking for that or reporting like
that then it’s sure there’s no diamond;

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:09.399
and even if it is there, doesn’t matter.

00:31:09.399 --> 00:31:17.990
After all, what is a diamond? – you are
wearing or they are wearing, what does it

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.990
matter?

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:25.213
In My father’s house all the doors were
open all the time, all the doors, day and

00:31:25.213 --> 00:31:26.213
night.

00:31:26.213 --> 00:31:31.860
Never a thief came in, thought that doors
are open so nothing is locked, there’s nothing

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:32.860
precious.

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:41.659
Only we had one theft, and the thief came
and took away a gramophone from us, and some

00:31:41.659 --> 00:31:42.659
records.

00:31:42.659 --> 00:31:44.990
So My father said, “He’s a connoisseur.

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:48.400
He took the right thing from this house, so
let it be.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:56.980
What’s the use of informing the police?”

00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:09.440
So this materialism that comes in is a mad,
mad, mad dog, and gives you a disease which

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:14.120
is worse than any disease that is possible.

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:22.860
How people play on it, on this disease, as
you must have known that doctors when you

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:27.760
get some disease little bit, they’ll take
out your teeth, take out your eyes, take out

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:33.410
your nose, take out your purse and take out
everything that you have, for a little thing

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:36.520
like malaria or something.

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:45.500
But this disease takes away everything that
is beautiful within you, that is good within

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:46.810
you.

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:51.020
For example, it started a fashion.

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:53.820
With this materialism they start fashions.

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:58.330
Ladies are more vulnerable.

00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:06.210
Fashion starts, any sort of fashion starts,
like the sleeves to be made long – in India

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:13.840
also they started – then make it short,
then make it half, then make it no sleeves.

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.610
I said, “I am not running that race.

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:20.779
I will have the sleeves all the time, same
sleeves so I don’t have to bother.

00:33:20.779 --> 00:33:26.580
I can tell My tailor and he can make whatever
way I want to have, the tailor, because he

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:31.830
knows I make one style” – finished with
it.

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:35.130
Why do people want to run with the fashion?

00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:41.890
Just think of it, what is the need to run
with the fashion?

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:44.640
Now new race has started, run with it.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.480
Then another race has started, run with it.

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:52.440
Then the third race has started, run with
it – all the time running with the mad race

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:57.309
of fashions.

00:33:57.309 --> 00:34:04.360
Now a new race has started of fashions not
to put any oil in the head, so you become

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:06.760
bald, then you buy wigs.

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:12.950
It’s all entrepreneurs who are working out,
it’s all enterprises.

00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:24.960
So you become absolutely bald-headed people,
then you get your wigs from them, then there

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:29.500
is a special charge for dressing the wigs,
so you go for dressing the wigs.

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:32.870
Goes on like mad.

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:44.910
Then there’s another type: now a new fashion
has started in London because, you see, these

00:34:44.910 --> 00:34:46.930
people want to make some money.

00:34:46.930 --> 00:34:52.480
People don’t even have so much of logic
and intelligence left in their heads to see

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:57.180
that what they were preaching one day, they
are just the thing against it.

00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:03.680
Formerly it was you had to wear a tail coat,
you had to have your hair absolutely done

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:10.470
with proper hair-grooming and all that, as
you can see in the old pictures.

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:15.680
Then it started striped three-piece suits.

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:25.060
Now it is, I mean, few days earlier was tight
clothes, then they developed varicose veins,

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:26.090
you see.

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:31.770
So no, no – now it is the fashion to wear
absolutely loose dresses.

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:37.590
I saw the other day one lady making a dress
out of a big blanket, going like this.

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:46.070
I thought she was some priest or someone!

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:49.290
So that stupidity has started.

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:59.390
Imagine – think of Sahasrara, think of Divine,
in what world we are, and in what world the

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:03.350
stupid people are going.

00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:11.530
That’s another world, absolutely another
stupid world where people just go after nonsensical

00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:18.090
things, changing from one to another, changing
from everything: ties are changed, everything

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:20.140
is changed, giving you such a headache.

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:23.020
All the time you have to think, “Now what
fashion is there?

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:25.250
Let’s find out in the newspaper.

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:26.790
What is – this is the fashion now.

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:29.690
All right, wear this dress.”

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:34.960
All this is befooling going on, because this
ghost has entered into us.

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:45.750
In Sahaja Yoga also when we enter, be careful,
materialism should not enter into your minds.

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:51.670
It’s nothing important.

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:57.560
Even when somebody dies you are supposed to
wear something black, or white or I don’t

00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:59.990
know what else, but white or black.

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:07.810
And somebody died in England who was a great
friend of My husband, and I had no black sari,

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:08.810
completely black.

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:10.810
I mean we don’t have such a sari.

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:12.260
I didn’t know what to do.

00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:14.410
I told My husband I don’t have a black sari.

00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:16.880
He said, “Then You don’t come.”

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:22.620
Imagine how his wife would feel if I don’t
go to the thing, how she would take it.

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:29.900
All this is nothing, what is important is
the black sari!

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:37.680
In every walk of life you are being befooled
by this materialism.

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:43.540
I don’t know how you got stuck into it first
of all.

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:46.410
And the other side is, the same people are
befooling you.

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:52.520
“All right, this is not good, this is too
much” – so go to the anti-culture.

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:58.360
What is anti-culture is another kind of materialism,
another kind of nonsense.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:05.160
Nowadays they are having in this London an
anti-culture movement which is called as “punks.”

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:11.790
I think out of date now Me, but still what’s
for the time being as I see is punks.

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:15.300
It costs them forty pounds sometimes to make
that hair.

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:24.110
I mean, is it something that you are saving
money on that?

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:31.370
So the whole thing works out just to take
out your attention from reality, from higher

00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:39.880
values, to something nonsensical.

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:48.650
In Sahaja Yoga also people must learn to lead
a life of collectivity.

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:55.890
It’s very important that we have to be collective.

00:38:55.890 --> 00:39:02.040
We shouldn’t talk of “This is mine, this
is mine, and this I own.”

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:07.270
Even about children you should not do like
that, “This is my own child, this is my

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:08.480
own baby.

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:16.900
This is my brother, this is my sister.”

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:22.410
This “my, my” should go away; but that’s
not possible, it’s not easy to forget about

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:28.000
it because left Nabhi and right Nabhi has
to be all right.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:34.240
The only way to do it is that “Mother, it’s
all Yours.”

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:40.590
It’s not dangerous to say that, because
I’ll never take anything that is supposed

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:44.450
to be yours.

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:49.180
Just to say, “Mother, it’s all Yours,”
to start it – “It’s all Yours.

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:57.190
I am Yours, my heart is Yours, all my things
are Yours, my life is Yours.”

00:39:57.190 --> 00:40:02.320
Even saying that is a big mantra for Sahasrara.

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:11.390
The deity of Sahasrara is a very simple person,
extremely simple, and can be moved with very

00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:17.110
little actions, can be pleased with very few
little actions here and there.

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:20.620
Not much is needed to please the deity of
Sahasrara.

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:30.940
It’s a very simple person; little things
make Her happy.

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:36.620
Yesterday you had brought the flowers, and
I didn’t take them.

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:40.350
You all must have thought, “What’s it,
we couldn’t give flowers to Mother, holding

00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:41.500
in our hand.”

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:46.690
But I wanted to show this miracle to you,
that’s why I didn’t take.

00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:52.570
And I took it in the end, and see now they
are the best among all of them; don’t they

00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:58.490
look as if they have been plucked from the
tree?

00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:04.590
Just I wanted to show this, so I said, “I’m
tired,” I sat down and then I looked at

00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:12.970
you with the flowers, you see, in the hands,
you’re sitting all of you!

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:22.580
So She is Leela Vinodini.

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:31.110
She plays around, makes little mischiefs here
and there for you to learn lessons.

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:37.770
Because if I tell you “Do this” then it’s
not possible, but little circuitous way I

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:41.500
can show you that this is wrong, you should
not do it.

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:47.380
There’s nothing to feel bad, I would have
taken all the flowers; but somebody must have

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:51.010
thought of it, why Mother has not taken the
flowers today.

00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:59.330
I don’t know if you thought of it or not,
but I knew it Myself that I have to take the

00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:04.760
flowers to show this miracle to them, that
these flowers are going to last much longer

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:12.180
than any other flowers, because they are vibrated
with the Brahmachaitanya.

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:17.220
And the water was very, very, very cold, so
even I opened a hot water tap.

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:26.070
It’s all right, doesn’t matter, they didn’t
die, despite that they are perfectly all right.

00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:32.890
So you have seen so many miracles of this
Brahmachaitanya which is showing on your photographs,

00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:40.530
on so many your lives, in so many changes
that have taken place within yourself, within

00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:44.730
your family, within every one of you.

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:49.110
All this has happened because you are in Brahmachaitanya.

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:55.370
All this you are receiving because you are
blessed by Brahmachaitanya.

00:42:55.370 --> 00:43:00.660
But others are not, so your attitude should
be towards them that they are in the other

00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:04.040
world – what to do, how to help them?

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:10.080
We should try to help them if possible, but
up to a point.

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:12.550
We should not drag down ourselves for others’
sake.

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:18.740
Up to a point only we can help them, and we
have to be very happy that Sahaja Yoga is

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:22.230
spreading so much horizontally.

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:26.920
But for vertical thing we must know our quality
must improve.

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:31.740
If some people rise higher, others will also
start rising with them.

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:38.920
It’s the absolute honesty of purpose should
be there, absolutely understanding should

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:41.450
be there.

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:45.680
Open your hearts to each other, so that you
open your hearts to Me.

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:51.030
Every cell must know another cell, otherwise
it won’t work out.

00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:59.870
That is a great thing that has happened, when
you are on this Earth, when you are the ones

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:03.310
who have to receive this great blessing.

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:09.810
So many saints did not receive it, so many
great people who came on this Earth, they

00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:11.090
did not receive it.

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:17.120
Even the incarnations who came on this Earth
could not do it what you are doing.

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:25.800
So have that satisfaction and glory of your
own being and of your own standard, and of

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:26.800
your own caliber.

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:32.060
The others are not of your caliber, all right,
forget about it.

00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:38.380
That should not give you ego, but should give
you a personality that does not react.

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:46.480
We have something of our own, we do not react
to things.

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:49.500
We are not reactionaries.

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:56.320
And things will disappear which are harmful.

00:44:56.320 --> 00:47:30.640
Everything will be perfectly all right, because
we are standing

00:47:30.640 --> 00:48:29.190
in our

00:48:29.190 --> 00:49:46.750
own perfection, in our own glory.

00:49:46.750 --> 00:50:23.020
What do we need?

00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:46.540
Nothing, just enjoying ourselves.

00:50:46.540 --> 01:20:47.710
May God bless you all.
