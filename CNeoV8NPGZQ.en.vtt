00:00:01.114 --> 00:00:04.680
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:17.814
At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is.

00:00:24.148 --> 00:00:29.747
We cannot change it, we cannot conceptualise it,

00:00:30.514 --> 00:00:35.248
at this human state.

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:51.614
Whatever I want to tell you today,

00:00:52.014 --> 00:00:56.248
you are not to accept it blindfolded,

00:01:03.447 --> 00:01:08.047
but you should have an open mind of a scientist

00:01:13.248 --> 00:01:20.248
and if it works, then you have to accept, as honest people,

00:01:25.747 --> 00:01:31.214
because it is for the benevolence of every individual

00:01:33.413 --> 00:01:38.248
and for the benevolence of your country

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.248
and for the benevolence of the whole world.

00:01:51.148 --> 00:01:55.248
These are special times when we are born.

00:01:59.047 --> 00:02:01.148
I call it as a blossom time,

00:02:03.514 --> 00:02:07.248
where many seekers of truth are born,

00:02:10.814 --> 00:02:14.781
but they have to know first of all, what is the truth.

00:02:20.081 --> 00:02:27.181
First thing is that you are not this body, this mind,

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:31.514
this intelligence, this ego, these conditionings,

00:02:31.747 --> 00:02:34.947
but you are the pure Spirit.

00:02:49.148 --> 00:02:53.614
The second truth is that there is a subtle,

00:02:53.814 --> 00:02:57.914
all-pervading power of divine love

00:03:05.014 --> 00:03:09.148
and this power does all the living work.

00:03:12.914 --> 00:03:17.547
We see these beautiful flowers and we take them for granted.

00:03:17.881 --> 00:03:21.248
We don’t even think that it’s a miracle,

00:03:27.547 --> 00:03:31.680
how from one seed these flowers have come.

00:03:37.847 --> 00:03:41.647
Also who runs our heart?

00:03:45.747 --> 00:03:48.814
Doctors will say, autonomous nervous system,

00:03:52.347 --> 00:03:54.347
But who is this 'auto'?

00:03:56.614 --> 00:04:04.014
We have science but it cannot give us answers fully.

00:04:09.947 --> 00:04:14.847
It cannot answer, why are we here on this earth.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.447
It cannot answer what is our purpose of life.

00:04:27.914 --> 00:04:31.148
It cannot tell you about totality.

00:04:34.248 --> 00:04:36.747
So we take to religion.

00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:44.248
It’s very disappointing to see that all these great religions

00:04:44.447 --> 00:04:48.413
are only power oriented or money oriented,

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.914
and they are not spirit oriented.

00:05:02.248 --> 00:05:07.413
Every religion, every scripture has said that,

00:05:07.647 --> 00:05:10.747
you are to be born again.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.714
They have talked of your resurrection.

00:05:24.014 --> 00:05:28.181
Some people just brand themselves as born again but they are not.

00:05:33.248 --> 00:05:35.248
They are just like us.

00:05:37.714 --> 00:05:41.747
Any religion, now for example Catholic religion we can take:

00:05:46.714 --> 00:05:51.680
It is absolutely unnatural to make nuns and

00:05:51.914 --> 00:05:54.547
priests who cannot marry.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.747
That’s why there are problems.

00:06:04.847 --> 00:06:10.747
They are priests, they are nuns, but they are having women

00:06:11.014 --> 00:06:14.248
and the nuns are becoming pregnant.

00:06:21.747 --> 00:06:26.547
It is also true that when we are not

00:06:26.747 --> 00:06:30.580
connected with this all-pervading power,

00:06:30.814 --> 00:06:38.214
we are slaves of all sorts of ideologies.

00:06:49.014 --> 00:06:53.148
An entrepreneur can enslave us.

00:06:55.947 --> 00:07:02.248
See, for example he starts very tight pants,

00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:08.914
so every body loses his personality,

00:07:09.114 --> 00:07:12.447
his identity and starts wearing the same.

00:07:18.547 --> 00:07:22.447
'Till they develop varicose veins.

00:07:33.148 --> 00:07:39.413
Also the new styles every year coming up from Paris.

00:07:44.081 --> 00:07:50.181
Now in England to wear six inches of skirts, is absolutely dangerous

00:07:54.248 --> 00:07:58.214
but we accept it, because we have to be 'in'.

00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:05.647
All of us lose our identity and we start

00:08:05.847 --> 00:08:13.248
taking to some sort of a idea which is just put through medias to us

00:08:19.547 --> 00:08:22.547
So in the democratic countries, the freedom that is given to us

00:08:22.747 --> 00:08:25.547
really makes us slaves.

00:08:33.914 --> 00:08:36.081
Now the worst is America,

00:08:39.781 --> 00:08:43.914
they also produce some sort of a stupid idea.

00:08:44.114 --> 00:08:50.380
For example, recently now they are celebrating the birthday of dogs.

00:08:59.181 --> 00:09:02.781
If that is not so,

00:09:02.981 --> 00:09:06.947
now they have teddy bears which have got birth dates.

00:09:12.914 --> 00:09:15.781
And very seriously they believe in it.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:22.081
Such idiotic things if we are doing in our freedom,

00:09:22.248 --> 00:09:24.248
where is our wisdom?

00:09:29.614 --> 00:09:35.081
For example, a lady marries eighth time or ninth time

00:09:39.248 --> 00:09:41.747
and there are four thousand people, more than you,

00:09:41.914 --> 00:09:46.014
four thousand people, watching her going to honeymoon!

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:55.248
And there are ten helicopters which are hovering around

00:09:58.114 --> 00:10:03.680
and they are parachuting down with the cameras,

00:10:09.447 --> 00:10:15.347
and they fall on the trees or they fall on people.

00:10:20.248 --> 00:10:25.148
America is supposed to be the greatest democratic country.

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:35.514
If you go there, you can’t even wear your wedding ring,

00:10:35.747 --> 00:10:38.248
the people might kill you for that.

00:10:44.081 --> 00:10:47.680
So, where are we going?

00:10:51.014 --> 00:10:57.413
There are diseases like aids and schizophrenia all kinds of diseases

00:11:02.647 --> 00:11:05.647
and nobody has any solution.

00:11:09.148 --> 00:11:12.547
The children are becoming murderers,

00:11:15.747 --> 00:11:17.747
drug addicts -

00:11:20.081 --> 00:11:22.447
what’s going to happen to us?

00:11:24.781 --> 00:11:28.148
Is this the reward for our freedom?

00:11:32.547 --> 00:11:35.114
Are we really free?

00:11:37.547 --> 00:11:41.214
Freedom without wisdom has no meaning at all.

00:11:46.047 --> 00:11:51.647
We take to all kinds of destructive things very easily.

00:11:56.248 --> 00:12:01.313
For example, Switzerland, which is very affluent as you know,

00:12:01.514 --> 00:12:05.248
making money out of the third world,

00:12:05.413 --> 00:12:09.947
is having people who are committing suicides,

00:12:23.148 --> 00:12:27.380
And other Scandinavian countries who are affluent again,

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.881
are competing with them in committing suicide.

00:12:38.747 --> 00:12:43.347
All this is happening, we see it every day in the newspaper

00:12:43.547 --> 00:12:45.547
and we are shocked.

00:12:50.413 --> 00:12:55.047
What is the reason, we should find out, what is the solution.

00:13:00.313 --> 00:13:08.114
The main problem is that we are not yet fully evolved.

00:13:13.847 --> 00:13:18.148
We have not yet become the Spirit.

00:13:21.914 --> 00:13:27.781
In our evolutionary state we have become human beings, all right,

00:13:32.413 --> 00:13:38.847
but there has to be something more, the last break through,

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:48.181
by which we get our wisdom

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:57.248
and we relate it to reality.

00:14:02.248 --> 00:14:06.248
So as you are told, this subtle system

00:14:06.347 --> 00:14:10.347
is within you which works it out.

00:14:16.248 --> 00:14:19.547
It’s within all of you.

00:14:22.347 --> 00:14:29.547
It was placed in the triangular bone, which we call as sacrum.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.747
That means the Greek knew it’s a sacred bone.

00:14:41.914 --> 00:14:48.413
So there is already placed within us a power by which we can ascend

00:14:48.614 --> 00:14:52.248
and become one with this all-pervading power.

00:14:59.847 --> 00:15:06.313
Now in the west the whole civilization has grown big, very big.

00:15:10.714 --> 00:15:15.480
But for this big tree we should know our roots.

00:15:21.413 --> 00:15:25.081
And the knowledge of the roots if it comes from East,

00:15:25.248 --> 00:15:27.313
why should we mind?

00:15:32.347 --> 00:15:38.714
For a saint, East and West doesn’t exist.

00:15:43.947 --> 00:15:48.547
The solution lies in understanding what we are,

00:15:52.413 --> 00:15:56.614
and that is very simple, very easy to get it.

00:16:00.148 --> 00:16:03.680
Sahaja, means born with you,

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:11.781
is the right to have this yoga,

00:16:11.981 --> 00:16:18.914
meaning the union with this all-pervading power of divine love.

00:16:27.714 --> 00:16:29.747
Like this instrument here,

00:16:29.947 --> 00:16:32.847
if it is not connected to the mains it has no meaning.

00:16:33.047 --> 00:16:35.114
It has no identity.

00:16:43.747 --> 00:16:49.480
In these modern times even to talk about God is out of date,

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:59.514
but now the time has come to prove the existence of God!

00:17:03.747 --> 00:17:06.514
Sahaja Yoga is meta science,

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:14.647
where, when you get connected with this all-pervading power,

00:17:14.847 --> 00:17:20.114
you can feel the absolute truth on your fingertips.

00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:32.248
Even children can feel the same,

00:17:35.413 --> 00:17:39.680
because Spirit is the source of absolute truth.

00:17:45.614 --> 00:17:49.248
You have been already told there are five, six and seven centres

00:17:49.347 --> 00:17:55.280
on the right and five, six and seven centres on the left hand.

00:18:03.313 --> 00:18:06.881
These are sympathetic centres which get enlightened.

00:18:10.981 --> 00:18:15.547
When this power rises through six centres,

00:18:15.747 --> 00:18:19.580
She emerges through your seventh here,

00:18:19.781 --> 00:18:23.714
centre which we call as the fontanel bone area

00:18:32.981 --> 00:18:39.847
and you get actualisation. Again I say actualisation of baptism.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.680
It is not that somebody puts the water on your head

00:18:46.881 --> 00:18:48.881
and says you are baptised.

00:18:53.014 --> 00:18:57.847
There is no difference between a Christian, Hindu, Muslim, anyone,

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.547
they can commit the same sins.

00:19:09.947 --> 00:19:13.647
But once this connection takes place,

00:19:17.447 --> 00:19:20.047
you start feeling on your fingertips

00:19:20.248 --> 00:19:23.514
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, as they call it.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:35.547
Then you know also what’s wrong with you.

00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:45.413
Most of the world problems are because of human beings.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:55.148
And most of the human problems are because of their subtle centres,

00:20:00.881 --> 00:20:06.248
because these centres look after your

00:20:06.413 --> 00:20:11.047
physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being,

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:28.480
and if you know what’s wrong with you on your fingertips,

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:32.814
you have the self knowledge of your being.

00:20:39.081 --> 00:20:44.181
That means instead of going to the moon, you go within yourself.

00:20:50.647 --> 00:20:55.914
Now as a result your physical being is cured,

00:20:56.114 --> 00:21:02.114
means many of the incurable diseases have been cured by Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:11.413 --> 00:21:17.680
Also mental troubles and spiritual troubles which have come

00:21:17.881 --> 00:21:23.847
by going to wrong places - all have been mostly cured.

00:21:32.881 --> 00:21:36.814
All this curing takes place by your own power

00:21:42.647 --> 00:21:48.614
and it’s your own doing, your own understanding

00:21:48.814 --> 00:21:51.514
which gives you this Self-realization.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.747
Then the second thing that happens to you,

00:21:59.947 --> 00:22:04.248
that on your fingertips you can feel the centres of others.

00:22:09.947 --> 00:22:12.614
Say, if you think of somebody who is dead

00:22:12.814 --> 00:22:16.248
or somebody who is far away and just put your hands like this,

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.947
you can know what centres are in jeopardy.

00:22:30.747 --> 00:22:35.447
Thus you develop a new dimension in your human awareness

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:39.114
which you call as 'collective consciousness'.

00:22:46.647 --> 00:22:52.248
Now, when we are thinking,

00:22:52.447 --> 00:22:56.814
we are thinking about the past or about the future.

00:23:01.881 --> 00:23:05.480
Past is finished and future doesn’t exist.

00:23:09.881 --> 00:23:16.747
So, if I say you have to be in the present you cannot be.

00:23:21.447 --> 00:23:26.347
But when this power rises, She separates these thoughts

00:23:29.514 --> 00:23:34.248
and between those thoughts there is a space

00:23:36.981 --> 00:23:40.313
and this space is the present.

00:23:42.847 --> 00:23:47.847
So you develop another dimension in your human awareness,

00:23:48.047 --> 00:23:52.614
which we call as 'thoughtless aware',

00:23:55.714 --> 00:23:58.014
'thoughtless awareness'.

00:24:04.781 --> 00:24:07.347
That means you are aware, absolutely alert,

00:24:10.248 --> 00:24:12.280
but you are thoughtless.

00:24:13.614 --> 00:24:16.047
If you want to think, you can think,

00:24:16.248 --> 00:24:19.047
if you don’t want to think, you need not think.

00:24:24.747 --> 00:24:30.047
Because of this bombardment of thoughts you get stress and strain.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.413
But then you open out

00:24:40.248 --> 00:24:45.847
and all problems are sort of dissolved.

00:24:49.447 --> 00:24:54.313
For example, if you are in the water, you are afraid of the waves.

00:24:58.747 --> 00:25:05.248
But somehow if you can get into the boat then you can see the waves,

00:25:09.547 --> 00:25:11.647
you are not disturbed by them.

00:25:13.081 --> 00:25:18.248
But somehow if you learn how to go back jump into the water

00:25:18.413 --> 00:25:21.447
and swim, you can save many.

00:25:27.947 --> 00:25:30.413
This is how Sahaja Yoga works.

00:25:32.714 --> 00:25:35.947
One person gets his realization,

00:25:36.148 --> 00:25:39.881
they get the power to give realizations to others.

00:25:45.814 --> 00:25:50.847
Like one candle is enlightened, can enlighten many candles.

00:25:54.881 --> 00:25:58.847
So this is the purpose of our life

00:26:01.148 --> 00:26:06.480
and the destiny is that we enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:26:12.014 --> 00:26:15.114
The life is filled with blessings there,

00:26:18.447 --> 00:26:20.680
you are completely protected,

00:26:22.714 --> 00:26:25.447
you enjoy every moment of your life

00:26:28.248 --> 00:26:33.614
and suddenly you find all over the world you have lots of friends,

00:26:33.814 --> 00:26:37.248
your own relations.

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:51.647
Because Spirit is the source of absolute knowledge,

00:26:56.714 --> 00:26:59.114
absolute truth.

00:27:02.081 --> 00:27:07.248
In the light of the Spirit you understand

00:27:07.447 --> 00:27:11.114
what is right and what is wrong for you.

00:27:17.114 --> 00:27:19.114
I don’t have to tell you.

00:27:21.781 --> 00:27:28.181
For example I am holding on to a snake and there is darkness,

00:27:33.248 --> 00:27:36.447
and somebody will say, "It's a snake, you throw away!"

00:27:36.647 --> 00:27:42.280
I will say, "No, it is a rope", because I am obstinate.

00:27:51.047 --> 00:27:54.014
'Till the snake bites me, I’ll not give up.

00:27:57.614 --> 00:28:01.081
But supposing there is little light,

00:28:03.814 --> 00:28:06.181
immediately I’ll throw away.

00:28:08.714 --> 00:28:11.114
That light, when it comes into you,

00:28:11.313 --> 00:28:13.313
you know what is constructive for you

00:28:13.514 --> 00:28:15.747
and what is destructive for you,

00:28:21.214 --> 00:28:25.047
and effortlessly you get transformed.

00:28:31.148 --> 00:28:36.248
The Spirit, when enlightens your attention,

00:28:36.447 --> 00:28:39.047
the attention becomes active.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:48.647
Suddenly you find your attention has become innocent.

00:28:52.514 --> 00:28:57.747
Believe me, innocence cannot be destroyed, whatever you may try.

00:29:02.047 --> 00:29:04.380
Maybe there may be some clouds,

00:29:07.047 --> 00:29:10.248
but these clouds, once removed,

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:14.148
you find your innocence completely intact,

00:29:19.647 --> 00:29:23.947
and your attention becomes absolutely innocent.

00:29:28.313 --> 00:29:30.714
Such attention is so powerful

00:29:30.914 --> 00:29:34.514
that wherever you put the attention, things work out.

00:29:43.447 --> 00:29:46.480
It is benevolent,

00:29:47.914 --> 00:29:49.914
it is compassionate

00:29:51.181 --> 00:29:53.814
and it’s very intelligent.

00:29:56.881 --> 00:30:00.114
The Spirit is the source of joy.

00:30:03.148 --> 00:30:08.947
Joy is not happiness and unhappiness. It is absolute.

00:30:13.547 --> 00:30:18.347
In this state of joy, you become the witness.

00:30:22.014 --> 00:30:24.781
The whole thing looks like a drama

00:30:28.914 --> 00:30:36.680
and you enjoy your own spiritual powers.

00:30:41.881 --> 00:30:45.647
Then you don’t develop your ego,

00:30:48.081 --> 00:30:52.181
because you start talking in third person.

00:30:55.413 --> 00:30:57.413
For a Sahaja Yogi will say,

00:30:57.614 --> 00:31:00.580
“Mother, it’s not working, it’s not going."

00:31:00.781 --> 00:31:03.347
They won’t say, “I can’t do it.”

00:31:10.914 --> 00:31:12.947
Thus you become an angel.

00:31:15.248 --> 00:31:18.480
It all sounds very fantastic, I agree,

00:31:21.214 --> 00:31:23.214
but you are fantastic!

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:26.981
You are glorious!

00:31:28.114 --> 00:31:30.148
You don’t know yourself.

00:31:31.181 --> 00:31:35.580
Once you know yourself you'll be amazed.

00:31:39.148 --> 00:31:44.413
Only thing, you have to not blindly refuse me

00:31:44.614 --> 00:31:47.248
or to blindly accept me.

00:31:54.081 --> 00:32:00.114
The only problem is that I cannot force Sahaja Yoga on you.

00:32:04.413 --> 00:32:06.413
I respect your freedom.

00:32:08.413 --> 00:32:10.413
You have to ask for it

00:32:12.313 --> 00:32:17.148
and if you have the pure desire, it works.

00:32:20.313 --> 00:32:23.248
It works in every one.

00:32:25.547 --> 00:32:30.313
Also there’s a big fashion to feel guilty for nothing at all.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.814
Now if you have done any mistakes

00:32:37.014 --> 00:32:39.881
you just face it. Why do you feel guilty?

00:32:46.447 --> 00:32:50.947
After all you are human beings, you are not God.

00:32:54.148 --> 00:32:56.347
And to err is human.

00:32:58.081 --> 00:33:00.847
What is the use of feeling guilty?

00:33:04.081 --> 00:33:10.214
If you feel guilty then this centre
here on the left goes into problem.

00:33:16.413 --> 00:33:21.214
Physically it causes a disease called angina,

00:33:25.248 --> 00:33:31.847
also it causes you spondylitis maybe, lethargic organs,

00:33:39.547 --> 00:33:41.347
so why feel guilty.

00:33:44.014 --> 00:33:46.248
Please don’t judge yourself.

00:33:48.248 --> 00:33:50.914
This power within you will judge you.

00:33:55.248 --> 00:33:59.248
It will hardly take ten to fifteen minutes for you

00:33:59.514 --> 00:34:01.914
to get your self realisation.

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:11.047
But you must be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

00:34:13.881 --> 00:34:16.947
Not to condemn yourself for anything what so ever.

00:34:20.014 --> 00:34:25.248
At this moment you are perfect,

00:34:28.248 --> 00:34:31.914
because this all-pervading power of Divine love

00:34:32.214 --> 00:34:35.248
is the ocean of forgiveness.

00:34:40.347 --> 00:34:43.214
So you have to forgive your self fully.

00:34:45.547 --> 00:34:47.248
This is the first condition,

00:34:49.248 --> 00:34:56.114
and the second condition is that you have to forgive everyone.

00:35:00.248 --> 00:35:02.413
Logically, whether you forgive

00:35:02.647 --> 00:35:05.248
or you don’t forgive, you don’t do anything.

00:35:10.747 --> 00:35:15.480
But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands

00:35:20.814 --> 00:35:24.148
and you torture yourself.

00:35:28.114 --> 00:35:32.148
If you understand it’s a myth,

00:35:35.248 --> 00:35:37.248
so please don’t even think about them

00:35:37.347 --> 00:35:40.014
because it’s a headache to think of those people,

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.248
and in general you forgive.

00:35:50.014 --> 00:35:53.914
We have a centre on the optic chiasma

00:35:54.248 --> 00:35:58.248
which is just like this it is closed completely,

00:36:02.114 --> 00:36:03.814
crossed like this,

00:36:05.614 --> 00:36:09.081
if you don’t forgive it won’t open,

00:36:12.047 --> 00:36:16.248
but if you forgive it opens and that’s
how the Kundalini can pass through.

00:36:21.047 --> 00:36:24.547
If you don’t for give yourself the Kundalini will get stuck here

00:36:24.814 --> 00:36:29.248
or if you don’t forgive others it will get stuck there.

00:36:36.881 --> 00:36:44.248
I request you again and again please fulfil these two conditions

00:36:49.747 --> 00:36:55.248
and the third condition is that you all be very ,very confident

00:36:55.347 --> 00:36:59.914
that you all will get your Self realisation.

00:37:08.547 --> 00:37:11.214
After all you are Human Beings.

00:37:13.814 --> 00:37:17.248
Human Beings are at the epitome of evolution

00:37:20.248 --> 00:37:24.248
and the journey is hardly three to four feet.

00:37:28.413 --> 00:37:29.947
So why not?

00:37:32.947 --> 00:37:35.881
Of course you cannot pay for it,

00:37:38.047 --> 00:37:39.480
it’s a living process.

00:37:41.248 --> 00:37:45.347
Like we put a seed in the Mother Earth and she sprouts by itself.

00:37:49.947 --> 00:37:53.081
Because it is built in, in the Mother Earth

00:37:53.248 --> 00:37:56.914
and built in, in the seed that they sprout.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:05.447
In the same way it is built in within you

00:38:13.914 --> 00:38:15.947
it is built in within you

00:38:16.248 --> 00:38:21.347
and whatever is built in within you, works automatically.

00:38:27.614 --> 00:38:31.148
You don’t have to go to Himalayas to stand on your heads,

00:38:34.313 --> 00:38:37.248
no you don’t have to suffer.

00:38:39.014 --> 00:38:45.847
It’s a very strange idea that you should suffer to get to God.

00:38:50.214 --> 00:38:54.881
Absurd. If God is

00:38:56.248 --> 00:39:02.248
the person who is your Father, he is the most compassionate.

00:39:08.447 --> 00:39:11.714
Which Father wants his son to suffer?

00:39:14.547 --> 00:39:20.248
So how can the Father of all the Fathers would like to do that?

00:39:24.647 --> 00:39:26.547
So there’s nothing to suffer

00:39:26.814 --> 00:39:30.313
here on your chair so you can get your self-realisation.

00:39:36.647 --> 00:39:38.148
I promise you

00:39:40.248 --> 00:39:42.714
but, have faith in yourself.

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.347
Have confidence within your self.

00:39:47.947 --> 00:39:51.280
It is working out because the time has come

00:39:54.148 --> 00:39:56.248
and because you are seekers of truth,

00:39:58.248 --> 00:40:01.747
it’s not meant for idiots and stupid people

00:40:04.814 --> 00:40:09.847
It is meant for only seekers of truth.

00:40:12.514 --> 00:40:15.248
.It’s not meant for arrogant people

00:40:17.547 --> 00:40:19.914
or people who are conditioned and

00:40:20.214 --> 00:40:23.047
glued to some sort of an organisation.

00:40:28.248 --> 00:40:31.680
First you have to be free to be absolutely free.

00:40:36.248 --> 00:40:39.148
This is what it is as in Sanskrit they call it

00:40:39.313 --> 00:40:42.814
a realised soul as 'dvijaha'

00:40:48.614 --> 00:40:51.248
means twice born.

00:40:54.014 --> 00:40:56.680
Even a bird is called as dvijaha.

00:40:59.413 --> 00:41:05.847
First a bird is like an egg, then it becomes a bird.

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:17.280
In the same way Human Beings also become Realised Souls.

00:41:23.714 --> 00:41:31.248
I had come to Hamburg about year of 1965

00:41:35.847 --> 00:41:39.148
and I had that time only the feeling

00:41:39.347 --> 00:41:44.280
that Germans are the first who should understand Sahaja Yoga

00:41:51.547 --> 00:41:59.280
and I’m really surprised how they are sensible to see the point.

00:42:06.248 --> 00:42:12.214
That is how not only that you get your realisation,

00:42:12.248 --> 00:42:16.014
but, you give it to the whole world

00:42:22.881 --> 00:42:25.248
or surprisingly, very surprisingly

00:42:25.614 --> 00:42:29.248
it’s in Russia that Sahaja Yoga has taken over.

00:42:35.914 --> 00:42:41.547
Perhaps they never had any time to waste on choices.

00:42:49.081 --> 00:42:54.313
I’m not for communism, I’m not for this kind of democracy,

00:42:58.248 --> 00:43:01.947
but I was amazed the way they were introspecting

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:11.248
and now we have thousands and thousands of Russians

00:43:11.413 --> 00:43:13.714
who are Sahaja Yogis.

00:43:19.148 --> 00:43:27.081
It’s a joke, we had a meeting all of
us were there in Romania and one

00:43:28.547 --> 00:43:33.413
Sahaja Yogi from Russia asked an American one,

00:43:33.747 --> 00:43:38.248
“How many Sahaja Yogis do you have in America?”

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:53.514
so he said “We are fifty six.”

00:43:56.814 --> 00:43:59.214
So this Russian fellow says “Oh my God,

00:43:59.547 --> 00:44:04.814
we are only twenty one thousand you are fifty six thousand.”

00:44:13.214 --> 00:44:17.714
So something has worked out

00:44:18.047 --> 00:44:21.881
and should work out even in Germany I think because you are quite

00:44:22.248 --> 00:44:24.747
people in the centre

00:44:33.214 --> 00:44:36.014
and have been seekers of truth since long.

00:44:39.248 --> 00:44:43.714
I know these Germans when they came to India

00:44:44.148 --> 00:44:48.214
they were just seeking about Kundalini, about the truth,

00:44:48.313 --> 00:44:51.413
they didn’t bother about our diamonds

00:44:51.614 --> 00:44:54.947
and emeralds and all those things. They didn’t bother.

00:45:05.547 --> 00:45:13.514
And lastly I have to say that you all must be having some questions

00:45:18.881 --> 00:45:25.114
so I’ve now become an expert on answering any question what so ever,

00:45:29.647 --> 00:45:33.680
because I have been doing this for the last twenty three years now.

00:45:36.947 --> 00:45:39.914
But it is just a mental acrobat.

00:45:43.814 --> 00:45:48.248
Now for example these electric lights are here, beautiful ones.

00:45:48.514 --> 00:45:52.248
To put them on you need only one switch,

00:45:59.248 --> 00:46:00.747
because they are built in,

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:07.714
but supposing I have to tell you about the discovery of electricity

00:46:07.947 --> 00:46:13.081
and how it came to Hamburg and how it came to this hotel.

00:46:20.248 --> 00:46:22.248
Half of you would leave the hall.

00:46:26.248 --> 00:46:31.114
So the best thing is that we get our Enlightenment first.

00:46:52.347 --> 00:46:55.248
It’s very simple, very, very simple.

00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:01.680
Now, there’s only one request I have to make,

00:47:02.047 --> 00:47:04.847
that you have to take off your shoes because

00:47:05.081 --> 00:47:07.347
this Mother Earth helps us a lot.

00:47:17.248 --> 00:47:22.647
Again those who don’t want to do it can leave the hall.

00:47:48.248 --> 00:47:51.514
All of you can come and sit here there is room for you.

00:47:51.814 --> 00:47:53.680
See these gentleman,

00:47:54.114 --> 00:47:57.248
there’s room here, on this side.

00:48:19.714 --> 00:48:23.847
The first thing you will enjoy is your own peace.

00:48:31.248 --> 00:48:34.614
There is something so innate within us.

00:48:37.881 --> 00:48:42.547
I have met people who have got peace awards you see,

00:48:46.714 --> 00:48:48.947
but they have no peace with them.

00:48:51.248 --> 00:48:53.214
They are very hot tempered,

00:48:55.514 --> 00:48:59.514
if you have to go near them, better take a barge-pole.

00:49:03.248 --> 00:49:06.248
So all this hypocrisy finishes.

00:49:13.014 --> 00:49:14.847
You jump into reality.

00:49:18.714 --> 00:49:21.114
Alright it is very good now.

00:49:21.248 --> 00:49:24.347
Just you be all seated as you are very comfortably,

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:29.248
a little straight not too much of backward or forward,

00:49:29.313 --> 00:49:31.647
but a little straight.

00:49:37.081 --> 00:49:41.248
You have to put both your feet away from each other.

00:49:44.847 --> 00:49:46.847
I don’t know if you are told or not,

00:49:47.081 --> 00:49:50.248
that there are two powers, left and right.

00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:57.714
These are sympathetic powers

00:50:00.248 --> 00:50:07.947
and, by left you desire and by right you act.

00:50:14.081 --> 00:50:19.248
So, we have to put both the feet away from each other

00:50:23.248 --> 00:50:27.248
and put the left hand like this towards me which is symbolic

00:50:27.614 --> 00:50:34.214
that you want your realisation. Just to put like this. The left hand

00:50:40.248 --> 00:50:41.847
On your lap.

00:50:44.413 --> 00:50:48.680
Now use your right hand for nourishing your centres.

00:50:53.014 --> 00:50:54.814
You have to do it yourself.

00:50:56.647 --> 00:50:59.680
Only here, later on you don’t need.

00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:06.081
Now, this right hand you have to put it on your heart.

00:51:10.014 --> 00:51:16.248
In the heart resides, the spirit,

00:51:20.947 --> 00:51:25.248
if you become the spirit you become
your guide, you become your master.

00:51:31.514 --> 00:51:34.148
So, you put your right hand

00:51:34.248 --> 00:51:37.248
on the left hand side of your abdomen on the left hand side.

00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:42.480
We are working only on the left hand, upper portion of your abdomen.

00:51:48.148 --> 00:51:55.480
This is the centre of your mastery.

00:52:00.881 --> 00:52:04.747
Was created by great prophets.

00:52:11.614 --> 00:52:14.447
I’ve already told you that I respect your freedom

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:18.248
and I cannot force pure knowledge on you.

00:52:25.313 --> 00:52:27.248
So now please take your right hand

00:52:27.347 --> 00:52:31.114
in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

00:52:36.248 --> 00:52:42.747
This is the centre which gives you,

00:52:43.081 --> 00:52:45.814
the pure divine knowledge,

00:52:50.914 --> 00:52:55.248
which passes into brain and gets distributed.

00:52:59.248 --> 00:53:04.248
How it happens, you will know everything later on.

00:53:08.614 --> 00:53:13.214
You have to know that this is a collective happening.

00:53:16.447 --> 00:53:20.248
It’s like a collective organism.

00:53:23.014 --> 00:53:27.881
The microcosm becomes the macrocosm.

00:53:31.014 --> 00:53:34.547
Like a drop becomes the ocean.

00:53:36.914 --> 00:53:44.248
So if a nail is cut out of your body it doesn’t grow,

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:55.347
so to grow you have to come to our collective.

00:53:59.614 --> 00:54:04.714
For knowing this divine knowledge, you don’t have to pay anything

00:54:09.347 --> 00:54:12.714
but it becomes your innate knowledge.

00:54:14.847 --> 00:54:21.347
Only thing, you have to spend little time for your ascent.

00:54:27.647 --> 00:54:31.881
Ascent with complete maturity.

00:54:36.814 --> 00:54:39.248
Alright, so now please raise your right hand

00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:43.248
in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

00:54:49.248 --> 00:54:56.248
Here, I’ve told you that is the centre of your mastery.

00:55:00.614 --> 00:55:03.914
Now raise your hand on your heart,

00:55:06.248 --> 00:55:08.947
now in the corner of your neck and shoulder

00:55:09.114 --> 00:55:11.248
and turn your head to your right.

00:55:17.347 --> 00:55:20.248
I’ve already told you about this centre.

00:55:24.248 --> 00:55:31.647
Now please take your right hand on top of your forehead across

00:55:38.447 --> 00:55:41.647
Forgive everyone in general.

00:55:48.847 --> 00:55:51.881
Now, take back your hand on the back side of your head

00:55:52.114 --> 00:55:54.947
and push back your head as far as possible.

00:55:59.947 --> 00:56:07.847
Now here, is the centre where you don’t have to feel guilty,

00:56:08.248 --> 00:56:12.647
you don’t have to count your mistakes just for your satisfaction

00:56:12.881 --> 00:56:17.647
you have to ask forgiveness from this divine power.

00:56:30.614 --> 00:56:34.614
Now please stretch your right hand.

00:56:37.914 --> 00:56:41.114
Stretch the palm and put the centre of your palm

00:56:41.248 --> 00:56:44.514
on the fontanel bone. Now this is the last centre.

00:56:51.447 --> 00:56:53.248
Now please put down your head,

00:56:55.248 --> 00:56:58.814
here you have to move your scalp,

00:56:59.047 --> 00:57:04.881
not your hand so much as your scalp, seven times clockwise,

00:57:14.514 --> 00:57:19.647
slowly, that’s all we have to do.

00:57:22.313 --> 00:57:25.248
Now we have to close our eyes

00:57:27.914 --> 00:57:31.248
put your left and right feet away from each other.

00:57:36.248 --> 00:57:39.847
Please put your left hand on the left lap,

00:57:43.248 --> 00:57:47.248
and the right hand on your heart.

00:57:49.413 --> 00:57:55.514
Now here you close your eyes and
please don’t open them till I tell you.

00:58:00.847 --> 00:58:06.047
Better to take out your spectacles because

00:58:06.248 --> 00:58:10.248
maybe your eyesight might improve.

00:58:16.313 --> 00:58:24.248
Now, here is your Spirit.

00:58:26.947 --> 00:58:33.248
So ask me a very fundamental question about yourself three times.

00:58:33.614 --> 00:58:38.714
You can call me Mother or you can
call me Shri Mataji whatever you like.

00:58:49.647 --> 00:58:55.947
Ask please, three times, “Mother am I the Spirit”?

00:59:01.413 --> 00:59:05.081
Ask in your heart, not aloud please.

00:59:09.248 --> 00:59:12.248
I’ve already told you

00:59:12.347 --> 00:59:17.547
that if you become the Spirit, you become your own master.

00:59:23.747 --> 00:59:27.947
So now please put your right hand on

00:59:28.248 --> 00:59:32.881
the upper portion of your abdomen,
on the left hand side and press it.

00:59:33.148 --> 00:59:38.248
And here you ask me another fundamental question about your self.

00:59:38.914 --> 00:59:45.014
Three times, “Mother am I my own master”?

01:00:01.614 --> 01:00:05.680
I’ve already told you that I cannot force

01:00:06.047 --> 01:00:12.881
Divine knowledge on you, you have to ask for it.

01:00:20.248 --> 01:00:25.114
So now please take your right hand into the lower portion

01:00:25.248 --> 01:00:29.847
of your abdomen on the left hand side and ask six times,

01:00:30.114 --> 01:00:34.214
because, this centre has got six petals.

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:49.714
“Mother please give me pure knowledge”

01:00:54.814 --> 01:00:57.747
Please say it six times.

01:01:03.214 --> 01:01:10.347
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge,

01:01:10.914 --> 01:01:15.248
the Kundalini starts rising, so we have to

01:01:15.313 --> 01:01:23.280
nourish our higher centres with our full self confidence.

01:01:43.248 --> 01:01:46.680
So now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen

01:01:46.914 --> 01:01:51.547
on the left hand side and here with full self confidence

01:01:51.814 --> 01:01:59.214
you have to say ten times, “Mother I am my own master”.

01:02:14.248 --> 01:02:20.947
I’ve already told you, that you are not this body, this mind,

01:02:21.248 --> 01:02:24.248
this ego, this intelligence, these emotions and conditionings,

01:02:24.514 --> 01:02:27.248
but you are the pure Spirit.

01:02:40.747 --> 01:02:44.248
So now raise your right hand on your heart

01:02:44.447 --> 01:02:47.647
and with full confidence please say twelve times

01:02:48.014 --> 01:02:52.347
“Mother, I am the pure Spirit”.

01:03:06.947 --> 01:03:14.447
This all-pervading divine power, is the ocean of pure knowledge.

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:24.614
It is the ocean of compassion and bliss,

01:03:28.347 --> 01:03:32.313
but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:03:37.047 --> 01:03:41.047
So whatever mistakes you might have committed get easily dissolved

01:03:41.248 --> 01:03:45.081
into this ocean of forgiveness.

01:03:53.647 --> 01:03:59.447
So now raise your right hand in the corner of your shoulder

01:03:59.747 --> 01:04:03.547
and your neck and turn your head to your right.

01:04:09.747 --> 01:04:12.081
Now forgive your self

01:04:13.647 --> 01:04:21.447
and with self full confidence please say it sixteen times.

01:04:21.881 --> 01:04:27.248
“Mother I am not guilty at all”.

01:04:40.647 --> 01:04:45.480
I’ve already explained to you that whether

01:04:45.747 --> 01:04:50.280
you forgive or don’t forgive you don’t do any thing.

01:04:58.014 --> 01:05:03.148
But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands.

01:05:08.547 --> 01:05:11.814
All your life you have tortured yourself

01:05:12.248 --> 01:05:16.248
and at this moment if you don’t forgive, the centre

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:22.248
won’t open and you will miss your chance of self realisation.

01:05:33.847 --> 01:05:36.714
Just forgive, just forgive everyone.

01:05:39.514 --> 01:05:43.914
Raise your hand on top of your forehead and put down your head

01:05:44.148 --> 01:05:52.081
and now forgive every one without thinking about them.

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:10.881
Now please take your right hand on the back side of your head

01:06:11.248 --> 01:06:15.248
and push back your head as far as possible.

01:06:21.847 --> 01:06:25.447
Here without feeling guilty without counting your mistakes

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:28.248
you have to say for your satisfaction

01:06:28.447 --> 01:06:35.480
“Oh Divine Power if I have done anything wrong please for give me”

01:06:35.714 --> 01:06:39.214
and this you have to say from your heart

01:06:39.248 --> 01:06:42.714
without counting how many times.

01:07:08.248 --> 01:07:13.248
Now for the last centre you have to stretch your palm fully

01:07:13.413 --> 01:07:18.248
and put the centre of your palm on top of your head.

01:07:18.413 --> 01:07:24.248
On the fontanel bone area which was the soft bone in your childhood.

01:07:35.248 --> 01:07:39.248
Now please put down your head,

01:07:41.814 --> 01:07:43.914
here again I cannot force

01:07:44.148 --> 01:07:47.547
self-realisation on you. You have to ask for it.

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:56.447
So press your scalp, push back your fingers,

01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:59.747
this is very important to push back your fingers.

01:08:09.814 --> 01:08:13.914
Here you move your scalp seven times clockwise.

01:08:14.148 --> 01:08:21.047
Say “Mother, please give me my self-realisation” seven times.

01:09:15.081 --> 01:09:18.413
Now please take down your hands.

01:09:22.714 --> 01:09:29.747
Now please put both your hands open your eyes towards me like this.

01:09:36.248 --> 01:09:43.248
Now watch me without thinking. You can do it.

01:09:46.081 --> 01:09:49.248
Now put the left hand towards me and put down your head

01:09:49.248 --> 01:09:52.914
see with your right hand if there is a cool or a hot breeze

01:09:53.214 --> 01:09:57.647
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:10:05.647 --> 01:10:09.547
Now if you have not forgiven your self or forgiven others

01:10:09.747 --> 01:10:12.447
it will be hot breeze.

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:25.480
So now please forgive. Forgive everyone and forgive your self.

01:10:32.914 --> 01:10:38.248
Now please put right hand again towards me and see with left hand

01:10:38.614 --> 01:10:43.148
if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your

01:10:43.248 --> 01:10:46.214
fontanel bone area.

01:10:49.413 --> 01:10:51.248
On top of it.

01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:58.480
A little higher, don’t put it on top. A little higher.

01:11:04.447 --> 01:11:08.847
Now please put both the hands towards the sky like this

01:11:09.081 --> 01:11:11.447
and push back your head,

01:11:15.881 --> 01:11:19.714
close your eyes and ask a question three times.

01:11:19.914 --> 01:11:22.680
Anyone of these three questions,

01:11:29.614 --> 01:11:34.248
first one is “Mother is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost”

01:11:39.714 --> 01:11:46.248
or “Mother is this the al-pervading

01:11:46.413 --> 01:11:49.413
power of Divine Love”

01:11:55.947 --> 01:11:59.881
or “Mother is this the Paramachaitanya

01:12:03.514 --> 01:12:08.881
or Rue”? You see they are different names for the same thing.

01:12:12.947 --> 01:12:16.148
So you can ask anyone of these questions three times.

01:12:22.313 --> 01:12:25.081
Now take down your hands,

01:12:27.447 --> 01:12:30.114
please put your hands like this towards me

01:12:33.148 --> 01:12:38.148
and feel your peace in thoughtless awareness.

01:12:42.114 --> 01:12:47.081
All those who have felt cool or a hot breeze on their fingertips

01:12:47.248 --> 01:12:51.014
or on their hands or out of their fontanel bone area

01:12:51.248 --> 01:12:53.447
please raise both your hands.

01:13:06.248 --> 01:13:12.114
The whole of Hamburg, may God Bless you all. May God Bless. My God.

01:13:32.081 --> 01:13:38.248
Now again I have to tell you one
thing that it’s a collective happening.

01:13:43.248 --> 01:13:47.881
So you have to come to our collective programs.

01:13:51.214 --> 01:13:56.313
It’s a very big revolution going on

01:13:59.148 --> 01:14:04.413
and now you are the part and parcel of that spiritual revolution,

01:14:09.014 --> 01:14:14.148
which takes humanity to reality and it’s benevolence.

01:14:20.248 --> 01:14:25.313
You have to be mature in this,

01:14:28.248 --> 01:14:32.248
otherwise it would be like the parable of Christ

01:14:32.313 --> 01:14:37.280
where some seeds got sprouted and got lost.

01:14:44.248 --> 01:14:48.248
Of course you don’t have to pay anything I tell you again and again

01:14:53.047 --> 01:14:59.447
but, you have to spend some time for your self realisation.

01:15:03.248 --> 01:15:05.614
You don’t know what you have got.

01:15:08.047 --> 01:15:14.248
Say if I have German money I don’t know what it means,

01:15:18.248 --> 01:15:20.248
I have to spend it.

01:15:22.248 --> 01:15:27.248
In the same way what you have got it’s so precious you will know

01:15:27.614 --> 01:15:32.847
how precious it is when you will
mature and you will give it to others.

01:15:45.248 --> 01:15:49.514
So may God bless you.
