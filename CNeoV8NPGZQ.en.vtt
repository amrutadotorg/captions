WEBVTT

00:01.114 --> 00:04.680
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:10.881 --> 00:17.814
At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is.

00:24.148 --> 00:29.747
We cannot change it, we cannot conceptualise it,

00:30.514 --> 00:35.248
at this human state.

00:47.614 --> 00:51.614
Whatever I want to tell you today,

00:52.014 --> 00:56.248
you are not to accept it blindfolded,

01:03.447 --> 01:08.047
but you should have an open mind of a scientist

01:13.248 --> 01:20.248
and if it works, then you have to accept, as honest people,

01:25.747 --> 01:31.214
because it is for the benevolence of every individual

01:33.413 --> 01:38.248
and for the benevolence of your country

01:38.480 --> 01:42.248
and for the benevolence of the whole world.

01:51.148 --> 01:55.248
These are special times when we are born.

01:59.047 --> 02:01.148
I call it as a blossom time,

02:03.514 --> 02:07.248
where many seekers of truth are born,

02:10.814 --> 02:14.781
but they have to know first of all, what is the truth.

02:20.081 --> 02:27.181
First thing is that you are not this body, this mind,

02:27.647 --> 02:31.514
this intelligence, this ego, these conditionings,

02:31.747 --> 02:34.947
but you are the pure Spirit.

02:49.148 --> 02:53.614
The second truth is that there is a subtle,

02:53.814 --> 02:57.914
all-pervading power of divine love

03:05.014 --> 03:09.148
and this power does all the living work.

03:12.914 --> 03:17.547
We see these beautiful flowers and we take them for granted.

03:17.881 --> 03:21.248
We don’t even think that it’s a miracle,

03:27.547 --> 03:31.680
how from one seed these flowers have come.

03:37.847 --> 03:41.647
Also who runs our heart?

03:45.747 --> 03:48.814
Doctors will say, autonomous nervous system,

03:52.347 --> 03:54.347
But who is this 'auto'?

03:56.614 --> 04:04.014
We have science but it cannot give us answers fully.

04:09.947 --> 04:14.847
It cannot answer, why are we here on this earth.

04:19.280 --> 04:23.447
It cannot answer what is our purpose of life.

04:27.914 --> 04:31.148
It cannot tell you about totality.

04:34.248 --> 04:36.747
So we take to religion.

04:39.881 --> 04:44.248
It’s very disappointing to see that all these great religions

04:44.447 --> 04:48.413
are only power oriented or money oriented,

04:55.480 --> 04:57.914
and they are not spirit oriented.

05:02.248 --> 05:07.413
Every religion, every scripture has said that,

05:07.647 --> 05:10.747
you are to be born again.

05:16.280 --> 05:19.714
They have talked of your resurrection.

05:24.014 --> 05:28.181
Some people just brand themselves as born again but they are not.

05:33.248 --> 05:35.248
They are just like us.

05:37.714 --> 05:41.747
Any religion, now for example Catholic religion we can take:

05:46.714 --> 05:51.680
It is absolutely unnatural to make nuns and

05:51.914 --> 05:54.547
priests who cannot marry.

06:00.680 --> 06:02.747
That’s why there are problems.

06:04.847 --> 06:10.747
They are priests, they are nuns, but they are having women

06:11.014 --> 06:14.248
and the nuns are becoming pregnant.

06:21.747 --> 06:26.547
It is also true that when we are not

06:26.747 --> 06:30.580
connected with this all-pervading power,

06:30.814 --> 06:38.214
we are slaves of all sorts of ideologies.

06:49.014 --> 06:53.148
An entrepreneur can enslave us.

06:55.947 --> 07:02.248
See, for example he starts very tight pants,

07:06.081 --> 07:08.914
so every body loses his personality,

07:09.114 --> 07:12.447
his identity and starts wearing the same.

07:18.547 --> 07:22.447
'Till they develop varicose veins.

07:33.148 --> 07:39.413
Also the new styles every year coming up from Paris.

07:44.081 --> 07:50.181
Now in England to wear six inches of skirts, is absolutely dangerous

07:54.248 --> 07:58.214
but we accept it, because we have to be 'in'.

08:01.647 --> 08:05.647
All of us lose our identity and we start

08:05.847 --> 08:13.248
taking to some sort of a idea which is just put through medias to us

08:19.547 --> 08:22.547
So in the democratic countries, the freedom that is given to us

08:22.747 --> 08:25.547
really makes us slaves.

08:33.914 --> 08:36.081
Now the worst is America,

08:39.781 --> 08:43.914
they also produce some sort of a stupid idea.

08:44.114 --> 08:50.380
For example, recently now they are celebrating the birthday of dogs.

08:59.181 --> 09:02.781
If that is not so,

09:02.981 --> 09:06.947
now they have teddy bears which have got birth dates.

09:12.914 --> 09:15.781
And very seriously they believe in it.

09:18.680 --> 09:22.081
Such idiotic things if we are doing in our freedom,

09:22.248 --> 09:24.248
where is our wisdom?

09:29.614 --> 09:35.081
For example, a lady marries eighth time or ninth time

09:39.248 --> 09:41.747
and there are four thousand people, more than you,

09:41.914 --> 09:46.014
four thousand people, watching her going to honeymoon!

09:50.480 --> 09:55.248
And there are ten helicopters which are hovering around

09:58.114 --> 10:03.680
and they are parachuting down with the cameras,

10:09.447 --> 10:15.347
and they fall on the trees or they fall on people.

10:20.248 --> 10:25.148
America is supposed to be the greatest democratic country.

10:31.047 --> 10:35.514
If you go there, you can’t even wear your wedding ring,

10:35.747 --> 10:38.248
the people might kill you for that.

10:44.081 --> 10:47.680
So, where are we going?

10:51.014 --> 10:57.413
There are diseases like aids and schizophrenia all kinds of diseases

11:02.647 --> 11:05.647
and nobody has any solution.

11:09.148 --> 11:12.547
The children are becoming murderers,

11:15.747 --> 11:17.747
drug addicts -

11:20.081 --> 11:22.447
what’s going to happen to us?

11:24.781 --> 11:28.148
Is this the reward for our freedom?

11:32.547 --> 11:35.114
Are we really free?

11:37.547 --> 11:41.214
Freedom without wisdom has no meaning at all.

11:46.047 --> 11:51.647
We take to all kinds of destructive things very easily.

11:56.248 --> 12:01.313
For example, Switzerland, which is very affluent as you know,

12:01.514 --> 12:05.248
making money out of the third world,

12:05.413 --> 12:09.947
is having people who are committing suicides,

12:23.148 --> 12:27.380
And other Scandinavian countries who are affluent again,

12:27.580 --> 12:30.881
are competing with them in committing suicide.

12:38.747 --> 12:43.347
All this is happening, we see it every day in the newspaper

12:43.547 --> 12:45.547
and we are shocked.

12:50.413 --> 12:55.047
What is the reason, we should find out, what is the solution.

13:00.313 --> 13:08.114
The main problem is that we are not yet fully evolved.

13:13.847 --> 13:18.148
We have not yet become the Spirit.

13:21.914 --> 13:27.781
In our evolutionary state we have become human beings, all right,

13:32.413 --> 13:38.847
but there has to be something more, the last break through,

13:43.280 --> 13:48.181
by which we get our wisdom

13:52.380 --> 13:57.248
and we relate it to reality.

14:02.248 --> 14:06.248
So as you are told, this subtle system

14:06.347 --> 14:10.347
is within you which works it out.

14:16.248 --> 14:19.547
It’s within all of you.

14:22.347 --> 14:29.547
It was placed in the triangular bone, which we call as sacrum.

14:33.680 --> 14:36.747
That means the Greek knew it’s a sacred bone.

14:41.914 --> 14:48.413
So there is already placed within us a power by which we can ascend

14:48.614 --> 14:52.248
and become one with this all-pervading power.

14:59.847 --> 15:06.313
Now in the west the whole civilization has grown big, very big.

15:10.714 --> 15:15.480
But for this big tree we should know our roots.

15:21.413 --> 15:25.081
And the knowledge of the roots if it comes from East,

15:25.248 --> 15:27.313
why should we mind?

15:32.347 --> 15:38.714
For a saint, East and West doesn’t exist.

15:43.947 --> 15:48.547
The solution lies in understanding what we are,

15:52.413 --> 15:56.614
and that is very simple, very easy to get it.

16:00.148 --> 16:03.680
Sahaja, means born with you,

16:07.680 --> 16:11.781
is the right to have this yoga,

16:11.981 --> 16:18.914
meaning the union with this all-pervading power of divine love.

16:27.714 --> 16:29.747
Like this instrument here,

16:29.947 --> 16:32.847
if it is not connected to the mains it has no meaning.

16:33.047 --> 16:35.114
It has no identity.

16:43.747 --> 16:49.480
In these modern times even to talk about God is out of date,

16:54.580 --> 16:59.514
but now the time has come to prove the existence of God!

17:03.747 --> 17:06.514
Sahaja Yoga is meta science,

17:09.380 --> 17:14.647
where, when you get connected with this all-pervading power,

17:14.847 --> 17:20.114
you can feel the absolute truth on your fingertips.

17:28.547 --> 17:32.248
Even children can feel the same,

17:35.413 --> 17:39.680
because Spirit is the source of absolute truth.

17:45.614 --> 17:49.248
You have been already told there are five, six and seven centres

17:49.347 --> 17:55.280
on the right and five, six and seven centres on the left hand.

18:03.313 --> 18:06.881
These are sympathetic centres which get enlightened.

18:10.981 --> 18:15.547
When this power rises through six centres,

18:15.747 --> 18:19.580
She emerges through your seventh here,

18:19.781 --> 18:23.714
centre which we call as the fontanel bone area

18:32.981 --> 18:39.847
and you get actualisation. Again I say actualisation of baptism.

18:43.480 --> 18:46.680
It is not that somebody puts the water on your head

18:46.881 --> 18:48.881
and says you are baptised.

18:53.014 --> 18:57.847
There is no difference between a Christian, Hindu, Muslim, anyone,

19:02.680 --> 19:06.547
they can commit the same sins.

19:09.947 --> 19:13.647
But once this connection takes place,

19:17.447 --> 19:20.047
you start feeling on your fingertips

19:20.248 --> 19:23.514
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, as they call it.

19:29.480 --> 19:35.547
Then you know also what’s wrong with you.

19:41.514 --> 19:45.413
Most of the world problems are because of human beings.

19:49.680 --> 19:55.148
And most of the human problems are because of their subtle centres,

20:00.881 --> 20:06.248
because these centres look after your

20:06.413 --> 20:11.047
physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being,

20:22.480 --> 20:28.480
and if you know what’s wrong with you on your fingertips,

20:28.680 --> 20:32.814
you have the self knowledge of your being.

20:39.081 --> 20:44.181
That means instead of going to the moon, you go within yourself.

20:50.647 --> 20:55.914
Now as a result your physical being is cured,

20:56.114 --> 21:02.114
means many of the incurable diseases have been cured by Sahaja Yoga.

21:11.413 --> 21:17.680
Also mental troubles and spiritual troubles which have come

21:17.881 --> 21:23.847
by going to wrong places - all have been mostly cured.

21:32.881 --> 21:36.814
All this curing takes place by your own power

21:42.647 --> 21:48.614
and it’s your own doing, your own understanding

21:48.814 --> 21:51.514
which gives you this Self-realization.

21:57.680 --> 21:59.747
Then the second thing that happens to you,

21:59.947 --> 22:04.248
that on your fingertips you can feel the centres of others.

22:09.947 --> 22:12.614
Say, if you think of somebody who is dead

22:12.814 --> 22:16.248
or somebody who is far away and just put your hands like this,

22:16.480 --> 22:19.947
you can know what centres are in jeopardy.

22:30.747 --> 22:35.447
Thus you develop a new dimension in your human awareness

22:35.680 --> 22:39.114
which you call as 'collective consciousness'.

22:46.647 --> 22:52.248
Now, when we are thinking,

22:52.447 --> 22:56.814
we are thinking about the past or about the future.

23:01.881 --> 23:05.480
Past is finished and future doesn’t exist.

23:09.881 --> 23:16.747
So, if I say you have to be in the present you cannot be.

23:21.447 --> 23:26.347
But when this power rises, She separates these thoughts

23:29.514 --> 23:34.248
and between those thoughts there is a space

23:36.981 --> 23:40.313
and this space is the present.

23:42.847 --> 23:47.847
So you develop another dimension in your human awareness,

23:48.047 --> 23:52.614
which we call as 'thoughtless aware',

23:55.714 --> 23:58.014
'thoughtless awareness'.

24:04.781 --> 24:07.347
That means you are aware, absolutely alert,

24:10.248 --> 24:12.280
but you are thoughtless.

24:13.614 --> 24:16.047
If you want to think, you can think,

24:16.248 --> 24:19.047
if you don’t want to think, you need not think.

24:24.747 --> 24:30.047
Because of this bombardment of thoughts you get stress and strain.

24:35.280 --> 24:38.413
But then you open out

24:40.248 --> 24:45.847
and all problems are sort of dissolved.

24:49.447 --> 24:54.313
For example, if you are in the water, you are afraid of the waves.

24:58.747 --> 25:05.248
But somehow if you can get into the boat then you can see the waves,

25:09.547 --> 25:11.647
you are not disturbed by them.

25:13.081 --> 25:18.248
But somehow if you learn how to go back jump into the water

25:18.413 --> 25:21.447
and swim, you can save many.

25:27.947 --> 25:30.413
This is how Sahaja Yoga works.

25:32.714 --> 25:35.947
One person gets his realization,

25:36.148 --> 25:39.881
they get the power to give realizations to others.

25:45.814 --> 25:50.847
Like one candle is enlightened, can enlighten many candles.

25:54.881 --> 25:58.847
So this is the purpose of our life

26:01.148 --> 26:06.480
and the destiny is that we enter into the Kingdom of God.

26:12.014 --> 26:15.114
The life is filled with blessings there,

26:18.447 --> 26:20.680
you are completely protected,

26:22.714 --> 26:25.447
you enjoy every moment of your life

26:28.248 --> 26:33.614
and suddenly you find all over the world you have lots of friends,

26:33.814 --> 26:37.248
your own relations.

26:44.280 --> 26:51.647
Because Spirit is the source of absolute knowledge,

26:56.714 --> 26:59.114
absolute truth.

27:02.081 --> 27:07.248
In the light of the Spirit you understand

27:07.447 --> 27:11.114
what is right and what is wrong for you.

27:17.114 --> 27:19.114
I don’t have to tell you.

27:21.781 --> 27:28.181
For example I am holding on to a snake and there is darkness,

27:33.248 --> 27:36.447
and somebody will say, "It's a snake, you throw away!"

27:36.647 --> 27:42.280
I will say, "No, it is a rope", because I am obstinate.

27:51.047 --> 27:54.014
'Till the snake bites me, I’ll not give up.

27:57.614 --> 28:01.081
But supposing there is little light,

28:03.814 --> 28:06.181
immediately I’ll throw away.

28:08.714 --> 28:11.114
That light, when it comes into you,

28:11.313 --> 28:13.313
you know what is constructive for you

28:13.514 --> 28:15.747
and what is destructive for you,

28:21.214 --> 28:25.047
and effortlessly you get transformed.

28:31.148 --> 28:36.248
The Spirit, when enlightens your attention,

28:36.447 --> 28:39.047
the attention becomes active.

28:44.480 --> 28:48.647
Suddenly you find your attention has become innocent.

28:52.514 --> 28:57.747
Believe me, innocence cannot be destroyed, whatever you may try.

29:02.047 --> 29:04.380
Maybe there may be some clouds,

29:07.047 --> 29:10.248
but these clouds, once removed,

29:10.480 --> 29:14.148
you find your innocence completely intact,

29:19.647 --> 29:23.947
and your attention becomes absolutely innocent.

29:28.313 --> 29:30.714
Such attention is so powerful

29:30.914 --> 29:34.514
that wherever you put the attention, things work out.

29:43.447 --> 29:46.480
It is benevolent,

29:47.914 --> 29:49.914
it is compassionate

29:51.181 --> 29:53.814
and it’s very intelligent.

29:56.881 --> 30:00.114
The Spirit is the source of joy.

30:03.148 --> 30:08.947
Joy is not happiness and unhappiness. It is absolute.

30:13.547 --> 30:18.347
In this state of joy, you become the witness.

30:22.014 --> 30:24.781
The whole thing looks like a drama

30:28.914 --> 30:36.680
and you enjoy your own spiritual powers.

30:41.881 --> 30:45.647
Then you don’t develop your ego,

30:48.081 --> 30:52.181
because you start talking in third person.

30:55.413 --> 30:57.413
For a Sahaja Yogi will say,

30:57.614 --> 31:00.580
“Mother, it’s not working, it’s not going."

31:00.781 --> 31:03.347
They won’t say, “I can’t do it.”

31:10.914 --> 31:12.947
Thus you become an angel.

31:15.248 --> 31:18.480
It all sounds very fantastic, I agree,

31:21.214 --> 31:23.214
but you are fantastic!

31:24.680 --> 31:26.981
You are glorious!

31:28.114 --> 31:30.148
You don’t know yourself.

31:31.181 --> 31:35.580
Once you know yourself you'll be amazed.

31:39.148 --> 31:44.413
Only thing, you have to not blindly refuse me

31:44.614 --> 31:47.248
or to blindly accept me.

31:54.081 --> 32:00.114
The only problem is that I cannot force Sahaja Yoga on you.

32:04.413 --> 32:06.413
I respect your freedom.

32:08.413 --> 32:10.413
You have to ask for it

32:12.313 --> 32:17.148
and if you have the pure desire, it works.

32:20.313 --> 32:23.248
It works in every one.

32:25.547 --> 32:30.313
Also there’s a big fashion to feel guilty for nothing at all.

32:34.480 --> 32:36.814
Now if you have done any mistakes

32:37.014 --> 32:39.881
you just face it. Why do you feel guilty?

32:46.447 --> 32:50.947
After all you are human beings, you are not God.

32:54.148 --> 32:56.347
And to err is human.

32:58.081 --> 33:00.847
What is the use of feeling guilty?

33:04.081 --> 33:10.214
If you feel guilty then this centre
here on the left goes into problem.

33:16.413 --> 33:21.214
Physically it causes a disease called angina,

33:25.248 --> 33:31.847
also it causes you spondylitis maybe, lethargic organs,

33:39.547 --> 33:41.347
so why feel guilty.

33:44.014 --> 33:46.248
Please don’t judge yourself.

33:48.248 --> 33:50.914
This power within you will judge you.

33:55.248 --> 33:59.248
It will hardly take ten to fifteen minutes for you

33:59.514 --> 34:01.914
to get your self realisation.

34:07.680 --> 34:11.047
But you must be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

34:13.881 --> 34:16.947
Not to condemn yourself for anything what so ever.

34:20.014 --> 34:25.248
At this moment you are perfect,

34:28.248 --> 34:31.914
because this all-pervading power of Divine love

34:32.214 --> 34:35.248
is the ocean of forgiveness.

34:40.347 --> 34:43.214
So you have to forgive your self fully.

34:45.547 --> 34:47.248
This is the first condition,

34:49.248 --> 34:56.114
and the second condition is that you have to forgive everyone.

35:00.248 --> 35:02.413
Logically, whether you forgive

35:02.647 --> 35:05.248
or you don’t forgive, you don’t do anything.

35:10.747 --> 35:15.480
But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands

35:20.814 --> 35:24.148
and you torture yourself.

35:28.114 --> 35:32.148
If you understand it’s a myth,

35:35.248 --> 35:37.248
so please don’t even think about them

35:37.347 --> 35:40.014
because it’s a headache to think of those people,

35:44.680 --> 35:47.248
and in general you forgive.

35:50.014 --> 35:53.914
We have a centre on the optic chiasma

35:54.248 --> 35:58.248
which is just like this it is closed completely,

36:02.114 --> 36:03.814
crossed like this,

36:05.614 --> 36:09.081
if you don’t forgive it won’t open,

36:12.047 --> 36:16.248
but if you forgive it opens and that’s
how the Kundalini can pass through.

36:21.047 --> 36:24.547
If you don’t for give yourself the Kundalini will get stuck here

36:24.814 --> 36:29.248
or if you don’t forgive others it will get stuck there.

36:36.881 --> 36:44.248
I request you again and again please fulfil these two conditions

36:49.747 --> 36:55.248
and the third condition is that you all be very ,very confident

36:55.347 --> 36:59.914
that you all will get your Self realisation.

37:08.547 --> 37:11.214
After all you are Human Beings.

37:13.814 --> 37:17.248
Human Beings are at the epitome of evolution

37:20.248 --> 37:24.248
and the journey is hardly three to four feet.

37:28.413 --> 37:29.947
So why not?

37:32.947 --> 37:35.881
Of course you cannot pay for it,

37:38.047 --> 37:39.480
it’s a living process.

37:41.248 --> 37:45.347
Like we put a seed in the Mother Earth and she sprouts by itself.

37:49.947 --> 37:53.081
Because it is built in, in the Mother Earth

37:53.248 --> 37:56.914
and built in, in the seed that they sprout.

38:02.680 --> 38:05.447
In the same way it is built in within you

38:13.914 --> 38:15.947
it is built in within you

38:16.248 --> 38:21.347
and whatever is built in within you, works automatically.

38:27.614 --> 38:31.148
You don’t have to go to Himalayas to stand on your heads,

38:34.313 --> 38:37.248
no you don’t have to suffer.

38:39.014 --> 38:45.847
It’s a very strange idea that you should suffer to get to God.

38:50.214 --> 38:54.881
Absurd. If God is

38:56.248 --> 39:02.248
the person who is your Father, he is the most compassionate.

39:08.447 --> 39:11.714
Which Father wants his son to suffer?

39:14.547 --> 39:20.248
So how can the Father of all the Fathers would like to do that?

39:24.647 --> 39:26.547
So there’s nothing to suffer

39:26.814 --> 39:30.313
here on your chair so you can get your self-realisation.

39:36.647 --> 39:38.148
I promise you

39:40.248 --> 39:42.714
but, have faith in yourself.

39:44.680 --> 39:46.347
Have confidence within your self.

39:47.947 --> 39:51.280
It is working out because the time has come

39:54.148 --> 39:56.248
and because you are seekers of truth,

39:58.248 --> 40:01.747
it’s not meant for idiots and stupid people

40:04.814 --> 40:09.847
It is meant for only seekers of truth.

40:12.514 --> 40:15.248
.It’s not meant for arrogant people

40:17.547 --> 40:19.914
or people who are conditioned and

40:20.214 --> 40:23.047
glued to some sort of an organisation.

40:28.248 --> 40:31.680
First you have to be free to be absolutely free.

40:36.248 --> 40:39.148
This is what it is as in Sanskrit they call it

40:39.313 --> 40:42.814
a realised soul as 'dvijaha'

40:48.614 --> 40:51.248
means twice born.

40:54.014 --> 40:56.680
Even a bird is called as dvijaha.

40:59.413 --> 41:05.847
First a bird is like an egg, then it becomes a bird.

41:10.680 --> 41:17.280
In the same way Human Beings also become Realised Souls.

41:23.714 --> 41:31.248
I had come to Hamburg about year of 1965

41:35.847 --> 41:39.148
and I had that time only the feeling

41:39.347 --> 41:44.280
that Germans are the first who should understand Sahaja Yoga

41:51.547 --> 41:59.280
and I’m really surprised how they are sensible to see the point.

42:06.248 --> 42:12.214
That is how not only that you get your realisation,

42:12.248 --> 42:16.014
but, you give it to the whole world

42:22.881 --> 42:25.248
or surprisingly, very surprisingly

42:25.614 --> 42:29.248
it’s in Russia that Sahaja Yoga has taken over.

42:35.914 --> 42:41.547
Perhaps they never had any time to waste on choices.

42:49.081 --> 42:54.313
I’m not for communism, I’m not for this kind of democracy,

42:58.248 --> 43:01.947
but I was amazed the way they were introspecting

43:07.480 --> 43:11.248
and now we have thousands and thousands of Russians

43:11.413 --> 43:13.714
who are Sahaja Yogis.

43:19.148 --> 43:27.081
It’s a joke, we had a meeting all of
us were there in Romania and one

43:28.547 --> 43:33.413
Sahaja Yogi from Russia asked an American one,

43:33.747 --> 43:38.248
“How many Sahaja Yogis do you have in America?”

43:49.680 --> 43:53.514
so he said “We are fifty six.”

43:56.814 --> 43:59.214
So this Russian fellow says “Oh my God,

43:59.547 --> 44:04.814
we are only twenty one thousand you are fifty six thousand.”

44:13.214 --> 44:17.714
So something has worked out

44:18.047 --> 44:21.881
and should work out even in Germany I think because you are quite

44:22.248 --> 44:24.747
people in the centre

44:33.214 --> 44:36.014
and have been seekers of truth since long.

44:39.248 --> 44:43.714
I know these Germans when they came to India

44:44.148 --> 44:48.214
they were just seeking about Kundalini, about the truth,

44:48.313 --> 44:51.413
they didn’t bother about our diamonds

44:51.614 --> 44:54.947
and emeralds and all those things. They didn’t bother.

45:05.547 --> 45:13.514
And lastly I have to say that you all must be having some questions

45:18.881 --> 45:25.114
so I’ve now become an expert on answering any question what so ever,

45:29.647 --> 45:33.680
because I have been doing this for the last twenty three years now.

45:36.947 --> 45:39.914
But it is just a mental acrobat.

45:43.814 --> 45:48.248
Now for example these electric lights are here, beautiful ones.

45:48.514 --> 45:52.248
To put them on you need only one switch,

45:59.248 --> 46:00.747
because they are built in,

46:02.680 --> 46:07.714
but supposing I have to tell you about the discovery of electricity

46:07.947 --> 46:13.081
and how it came to Hamburg and how it came to this hotel.

46:20.248 --> 46:22.248
Half of you would leave the hall.

46:26.248 --> 46:31.114
So the best thing is that we get our Enlightenment first.

46:52.347 --> 46:55.248
It’s very simple, very, very simple.

46:57.280 --> 47:01.680
Now, there’s only one request I have to make,

47:02.047 --> 47:04.847
that you have to take off your shoes because

47:05.081 --> 47:07.347
this Mother Earth helps us a lot.

47:17.248 --> 47:22.647
Again those who don’t want to do it can leave the hall.

47:48.248 --> 47:51.514
All of you can come and sit here there is room for you.

47:51.814 --> 47:53.680
See these gentleman,

47:54.114 --> 47:57.248
there’s room here, on this side.

48:19.714 --> 48:23.847
The first thing you will enjoy is your own peace.

48:31.248 --> 48:34.614
There is something so innate within us.

48:37.881 --> 48:42.547
I have met people who have got peace awards you see,

48:46.714 --> 48:48.947
but they have no peace with them.

48:51.248 --> 48:53.214
They are very hot tempered,

48:55.514 --> 48:59.514
if you have to go near them, better take a barge-pole.

49:03.248 --> 49:06.248
So all this hypocrisy finishes.

49:13.014 --> 49:14.847
You jump into reality.

49:18.714 --> 49:21.114
Alright it is very good now.

49:21.248 --> 49:24.347
Just you be all seated as you are very comfortably,

49:24.680 --> 49:29.248
a little straight not too much of backward or forward,

49:29.313 --> 49:31.647
but a little straight.

49:37.081 --> 49:41.248
You have to put both your feet away from each other.

49:44.847 --> 49:46.847
I don’t know if you are told or not,

49:47.081 --> 49:50.248
that there are two powers, left and right.

49:55.680 --> 49:57.714
These are sympathetic powers

50:00.248 --> 50:07.947
and, by left you desire and by right you act.

50:14.081 --> 50:19.248
So, we have to put both the feet away from each other

50:23.248 --> 50:27.248
and put the left hand like this towards me which is symbolic

50:27.614 --> 50:34.214
that you want your realisation. Just to put like this. The left hand

50:40.248 --> 50:41.847
On your lap.

50:44.413 --> 50:48.680
Now use your right hand for nourishing your centres.

50:53.014 --> 50:54.814
You have to do it yourself.

50:56.647 --> 50:59.680
Only here, later on you don’t need.

51:02.480 --> 51:06.081
Now, this right hand you have to put it on your heart.

51:10.014 --> 51:16.248
In the heart resides, the spirit,

51:20.947 --> 51:25.248
if you become the spirit you become
your guide, you become your master.

51:31.514 --> 51:34.148
So, you put your right hand

51:34.248 --> 51:37.248
on the left hand side of your abdomen on the left hand side.

51:37.480 --> 51:42.480
We are working only on the left hand, upper portion of your abdomen.

51:48.148 --> 51:55.480
This is the centre of your mastery.

52:00.881 --> 52:04.747
Was created by great prophets.

52:11.614 --> 52:14.447
I’ve already told you that I respect your freedom

52:14.680 --> 52:18.248
and I cannot force pure knowledge on you.

52:25.313 --> 52:27.248
So now please take your right hand

52:27.347 --> 52:31.114
in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

52:36.248 --> 52:42.747
This is the centre which gives you,

52:43.081 --> 52:45.814
the pure divine knowledge,

52:50.914 --> 52:55.248
which passes into brain and gets distributed.

52:59.248 --> 53:04.248
How it happens, you will know everything later on.

53:08.614 --> 53:13.214
You have to know that this is a collective happening.

53:16.447 --> 53:20.248
It’s like a collective organism.

53:23.014 --> 53:27.881
The microcosm becomes the macrocosm.

53:31.014 --> 53:34.547
Like a drop becomes the ocean.

53:36.914 --> 53:44.248
So if a nail is cut out of your body it doesn’t grow,

53:50.480 --> 53:55.347
so to grow you have to come to our collective.

53:59.614 --> 54:04.714
For knowing this divine knowledge, you don’t have to pay anything

54:09.347 --> 54:12.714
but it becomes your innate knowledge.

54:14.847 --> 54:21.347
Only thing, you have to spend little time for your ascent.

54:27.647 --> 54:31.881
Ascent with complete maturity.

54:36.814 --> 54:39.248
Alright, so now please raise your right hand

54:39.480 --> 54:43.248
in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

54:49.248 --> 54:56.248
Here, I’ve told you that is the centre of your mastery.

55:00.614 --> 55:03.914
Now raise your hand on your heart,

55:06.248 --> 55:08.947
now in the corner of your neck and shoulder

55:09.114 --> 55:11.248
and turn your head to your right.

55:17.347 --> 55:20.248
I’ve already told you about this centre.

55:24.248 --> 55:31.647
Now please take your right hand on top of your forehead across

55:38.447 --> 55:41.647
Forgive everyone in general.

55:48.847 --> 55:51.881
Now, take back your hand on the back side of your head

55:52.114 --> 55:54.947
and push back your head as far as possible.

55:59.947 --> 56:07.847
Now here, is the centre where you don’t have to feel guilty,

56:08.248 --> 56:12.647
you don’t have to count your mistakes just for your satisfaction

56:12.881 --> 56:17.647
you have to ask forgiveness from this divine power.

56:30.614 --> 56:34.614
Now please stretch your right hand.

56:37.914 --> 56:41.114
Stretch the palm and put the centre of your palm

56:41.248 --> 56:44.514
on the fontanel bone. Now this is the last centre.

56:51.447 --> 56:53.248
Now please put down your head,

56:55.248 --> 56:58.814
here you have to move your scalp,

56:59.047 --> 57:04.881
not your hand so much as your scalp, seven times clockwise,

57:14.514 --> 57:19.647
slowly, that’s all we have to do.

57:22.313 --> 57:25.248
Now we have to close our eyes

57:27.914 --> 57:31.248
put your left and right feet away from each other.

57:36.248 --> 57:39.847
Please put your left hand on the left lap,

57:43.248 --> 57:47.248
and the right hand on your heart.

57:49.413 --> 57:55.514
Now here you close your eyes and
please don’t open them till I tell you.

58:00.847 --> 58:06.047
Better to take out your spectacles because

58:06.248 --> 58:10.248
maybe your eyesight might improve.

58:16.313 --> 58:24.248
Now, here is your Spirit.

58:26.947 --> 58:33.248
So ask me a very fundamental question about yourself three times.

58:33.614 --> 58:38.714
You can call me Mother or you can
call me Shri Mataji whatever you like.

58:49.647 --> 58:55.947
Ask please, three times, “Mother am I the Spirit”?

59:01.413 --> 59:05.081
Ask in your heart, not aloud please.

59:09.248 --> 59:12.248
I’ve already told you

59:12.347 --> 59:17.547
that if you become the Spirit, you become your own master.

59:23.747 --> 59:27.947
So now please put your right hand on

59:28.248 --> 59:32.881
the upper portion of your abdomen,
on the left hand side and press it.

59:33.148 --> 59:38.248
And here you ask me another fundamental question about your self.

59:38.914 --> 59:45.014
Three times, “Mother am I my own master”?

01:00:01.614 --> 01:00:05.680
I’ve already told you that I cannot force

01:00:06.047 --> 01:00:12.881
Divine knowledge on you, you have to ask for it.

01:00:20.248 --> 01:00:25.114
So now please take your right hand into the lower portion

01:00:25.248 --> 01:00:29.847
of your abdomen on the left hand side and ask six times,

01:00:30.114 --> 01:00:34.214
because, this centre has got six petals.

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:49.714
“Mother please give me pure knowledge”

01:00:54.814 --> 01:00:57.747
Please say it six times.

01:01:03.214 --> 01:01:10.347
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge,

01:01:10.914 --> 01:01:15.248
the Kundalini starts rising, so we have to

01:01:15.313 --> 01:01:23.280
nourish our higher centres with our full self confidence.

01:01:43.248 --> 01:01:46.680
So now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen

01:01:46.914 --> 01:01:51.547
on the left hand side and here with full self confidence

01:01:51.814 --> 01:01:59.214
you have to say ten times, “Mother I am my own master”.

01:02:14.248 --> 01:02:20.947
I’ve already told you, that you are not this body, this mind,

01:02:21.248 --> 01:02:24.248
this ego, this intelligence, these emotions and conditionings,

01:02:24.514 --> 01:02:27.248
but you are the pure Spirit.

01:02:40.747 --> 01:02:44.248
So now raise your right hand on your heart

01:02:44.447 --> 01:02:47.647
and with full confidence please say twelve times

01:02:48.014 --> 01:02:52.347
“Mother, I am the pure Spirit”.

01:03:06.947 --> 01:03:14.447
This all-pervading divine power, is the ocean of pure knowledge.

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:24.614
It is the ocean of compassion and bliss,

01:03:28.347 --> 01:03:32.313
but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:03:37.047 --> 01:03:41.047
So whatever mistakes you might have committed get easily dissolved

01:03:41.248 --> 01:03:45.081
into this ocean of forgiveness.

01:03:53.647 --> 01:03:59.447
So now raise your right hand in the corner of your shoulder

01:03:59.747 --> 01:04:03.547
and your neck and turn your head to your right.

01:04:09.747 --> 01:04:12.081
Now forgive your self

01:04:13.647 --> 01:04:21.447
and with self full confidence please say it sixteen times.

01:04:21.881 --> 01:04:27.248
“Mother I am not guilty at all”.

01:04:40.647 --> 01:04:45.480
I’ve already explained to you that whether

01:04:45.747 --> 01:04:50.280
you forgive or don’t forgive you don’t do any thing.

01:04:58.014 --> 01:05:03.148
But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands.

01:05:08.547 --> 01:05:11.814
All your life you have tortured yourself

01:05:12.248 --> 01:05:16.248
and at this moment if you don’t forgive, the centre

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:22.248
won’t open and you will miss your chance of self realisation.

01:05:33.847 --> 01:05:36.714
Just forgive, just forgive everyone.

01:05:39.514 --> 01:05:43.914
Raise your hand on top of your forehead and put down your head

01:05:44.148 --> 01:05:52.081
and now forgive every one without thinking about them.

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:10.881
Now please take your right hand on the back side of your head

01:06:11.248 --> 01:06:15.248
and push back your head as far as possible.

01:06:21.847 --> 01:06:25.447
Here without feeling guilty without counting your mistakes

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:28.248
you have to say for your satisfaction

01:06:28.447 --> 01:06:35.480
“Oh Divine Power if I have done anything wrong please for give me”

01:06:35.714 --> 01:06:39.214
and this you have to say from your heart

01:06:39.248 --> 01:06:42.714
without counting how many times.

01:07:08.248 --> 01:07:13.248
Now for the last centre you have to stretch your palm fully

01:07:13.413 --> 01:07:18.248
and put the centre of your palm on top of your head.

01:07:18.413 --> 01:07:24.248
On the fontanel bone area which was the soft bone in your childhood.

01:07:35.248 --> 01:07:39.248
Now please put down your head,

01:07:41.814 --> 01:07:43.914
here again I cannot force

01:07:44.148 --> 01:07:47.547
self-realisation on you. You have to ask for it.

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:56.447
So press your scalp, push back your fingers,

01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:59.747
this is very important to push back your fingers.

01:08:09.814 --> 01:08:13.914
Here you move your scalp seven times clockwise.

01:08:14.148 --> 01:08:21.047
Say “Mother, please give me my self-realisation” seven times.

01:09:15.081 --> 01:09:18.413
Now please take down your hands.

01:09:22.714 --> 01:09:29.747
Now please put both your hands open your eyes towards me like this.

01:09:36.248 --> 01:09:43.248
Now watch me without thinking. You can do it.

01:09:46.081 --> 01:09:49.248
Now put the left hand towards me and put down your head

01:09:49.248 --> 01:09:52.914
see with your right hand if there is a cool or a hot breeze

01:09:53.214 --> 01:09:57.647
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:10:05.647 --> 01:10:09.547
Now if you have not forgiven your self or forgiven others

01:10:09.747 --> 01:10:12.447
it will be hot breeze.

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:25.480
So now please forgive. Forgive everyone and forgive your self.

01:10:32.914 --> 01:10:38.248
Now please put right hand again towards me and see with left hand

01:10:38.614 --> 01:10:43.148
if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your

01:10:43.248 --> 01:10:46.214
fontanel bone area.

01:10:49.413 --> 01:10:51.248
On top of it.

01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:58.480
A little higher, don’t put it on top. A little higher.

01:11:04.447 --> 01:11:08.847
Now please put both the hands towards the sky like this

01:11:09.081 --> 01:11:11.447
and push back your head,

01:11:15.881 --> 01:11:19.714
close your eyes and ask a question three times.

01:11:19.914 --> 01:11:22.680
Anyone of these three questions,

01:11:29.614 --> 01:11:34.248
first one is “Mother is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost”

01:11:39.714 --> 01:11:46.248
or “Mother is this the al-pervading

01:11:46.413 --> 01:11:49.413
power of Divine Love”

01:11:55.947 --> 01:11:59.881
or “Mother is this the Paramachaitanya

01:12:03.514 --> 01:12:08.881
or Rue”? You see they are different names for the same thing.

01:12:12.947 --> 01:12:16.148
So you can ask anyone of these questions three times.

01:12:22.313 --> 01:12:25.081
Now take down your hands,

01:12:27.447 --> 01:12:30.114
please put your hands like this towards me

01:12:33.148 --> 01:12:38.148
and feel your peace in thoughtless awareness.

01:12:42.114 --> 01:12:47.081
All those who have felt cool or a hot breeze on their fingertips

01:12:47.248 --> 01:12:51.014
or on their hands or out of their fontanel bone area

01:12:51.248 --> 01:12:53.447
please raise both your hands.

01:13:06.248 --> 01:13:12.114
The whole of Hamburg, may God Bless you all. May God Bless. My God.

01:13:32.081 --> 01:13:38.248
Now again I have to tell you one
thing that it’s a collective happening.

01:13:43.248 --> 01:13:47.881
So you have to come to our collective programs.

01:13:51.214 --> 01:13:56.313
It’s a very big revolution going on

01:13:59.148 --> 01:14:04.413
and now you are the part and parcel of that spiritual revolution,

01:14:09.014 --> 01:14:14.148
which takes humanity to reality and it’s benevolence.

01:14:20.248 --> 01:14:25.313
You have to be mature in this,

01:14:28.248 --> 01:14:32.248
otherwise it would be like the parable of Christ

01:14:32.313 --> 01:14:37.280
where some seeds got sprouted and got lost.

01:14:44.248 --> 01:14:48.248
Of course you don’t have to pay anything I tell you again and again

01:14:53.047 --> 01:14:59.447
but, you have to spend some time for your self realisation.

01:15:03.248 --> 01:15:05.614
You don’t know what you have got.

01:15:08.047 --> 01:15:14.248
Say if I have German money I don’t know what it means,

01:15:18.248 --> 01:15:20.248
I have to spend it.

01:15:22.248 --> 01:15:27.248
In the same way what you have got it’s so precious you will know

01:15:27.614 --> 01:15:32.847
how precious it is when you will
mature and you will give it to others.

01:15:45.248 --> 01:15:49.514
So may God bless you.
