00:00.000 --> 00:00.892
2000-0408 Public Program Address to IAS officers wives association, Part 1, New Delhi, India

00:01.000 --> 00:09.892
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:16.000 --> 00:32.892
Today as they say is a ghor kaliyuga and all sorts of horrible things we can see, hear, read in the newspapers.

00:33.000 --> 00:41.892
It’s a fact that it’s a very bad times we are passing,

00:42.000 --> 00:53.892
also we find very low graded people, we can call them of very low value systems

00:54.000 --> 00:59.892
but it was also predicted long long time back

01:00.000 --> 01:08.892
that at this time only the people who are seeking the truth

01:09.000 --> 01:18.892
in the (hills sal days{unclear}), Himalayas all kinds of (god basis {unclear})will find the truth.

01:19.000 --> 01:28.892
Its already described by many many great astrologists, also by saints.

01:29.000 --> 01:43.892
So at this time we are priest in a very fortunate circumstances.

01:44.000 --> 01:54.892
I must say I have a great love for all the people who are in the IAS and IPS and all the civil services

01:55.000 --> 02:10.892
because I know what one has to go through, its life of great turmoil and sacrifice, also for the wife,

02:11.000 --> 02:28.892
but I always felt that this is like the soldier fighting in the war. We are here to build up this country.

02:29.000 --> 02:38.892
My husband was first in the foreign service, I had never heard of services and all that so I said now what must be the foreign services

02:39.000 --> 02:46.892
but I said I am not going to go to any foreign country, just now we have got freedom and we have to work here,

02:47.000 --> 02:50.892
we have to work out many things for this country.

02:51.000 --> 02:59.892
Not only that but I realized that civil service is the spinal cord of this country.

03:00.000 --> 03:12.892
It has to bear all the burns, all the troubles, all the burdens and at the same time it has a great responsibility to build this country

03:13.000 --> 03:22.892
and that’s why I put my, I should say all effort that my husband gets selected to IAS

03:23.000 --> 03:30.892
and somehow or the other we lost lot of money everything, it’s alright I said,

03:31.000 --> 03:41.892
I can live with anything but to live in the foreign countries and wasting your… (unclear as video has some disturbance)

03:42.000 --> 03:53.892
its time now, for us here, to live and I think this patriotism is the only thing by which we can live

03:54.000 --> 04:06.892
doing our civil service, understanding our responsibilities and also that we are the ministry of the government,

04:07.000 --> 04:21.892
of this country which is though run by parties after parties. It’s where I learned that women have to be extremely forbearing, sacrificing

04:22.000 --> 04:26.892
and always very much keeping happy.

04:27.000 --> 04:39.892
It’s a question of why are we here in this service, we are special people no doubt,

04:40.000 --> 04:47.892
we have special powers no doubt, but without misusing the powers what are you, nothing.

04:48.000 --> 04:58.892
If you misuse it then its not proper, and if you dont use it, you are powerless.

04:59.000 --> 05:14.892
This is really the situation but the enjoyment and the happiness and the satisfaction comes from the fact that you are working for your country.

05:15.000 --> 05:21.892
So this patriotism, which I imbibed from my parents also and also Mahatma Gandhi,

05:22.000 --> 05:34.892
I felt that we are duty bound to workout in such a manner that everyone of us do something which is very constructive and which is very helpful,

05:35.000 --> 05:43.892
but at the same time while doing that because of such a difficult situations we develop all kinds of problems

05:44.000 --> 05:50.892
and that’s what I am going to talk to you about.

05:51.000 --> 05:57.892
The first thing is, we see something, we react.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.892
This reaction can create two problems within us:

06:02.000 --> 06:07.892
one of conditioning or another of ego, both are troublesome things

06:08.000 --> 06:11.892
and they make us very nervous and tensed.

06:12.000 --> 06:18.892
The main thing is that the energy that is required for thinking, for futuristic planning (video disrupted).

06:19.000 --> 06:27.892
Sahajyoga comes from one’s center which creates the energy for the brain cells which are used all the time,

06:28.000 --> 06:36.892
we want taxing our brains, using its energy all the time but we don’t know how it is replaced and replaced to our centre.

06:37.000 --> 06:55.892
This centre is looking after so many organs that this overflow of energy to the brain for this futuristic life can creates lots of problems

06:56.000 --> 07:04.892
not only tension but lots of other problems also because this energy starts getting exhausted

07:05.000 --> 07:18.892
and when we are in the struggle this energy starts getting, sort of, finished or maybe we develop tremendous imbalance within ourselves.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.892
As I don’t know, whether they have put up the photograph of the kundalini,

07:24.000 --> 07:33.892
you can see here very clearly that our autonomous nervous system is in three channels

07:34.000 --> 07:39.892
and either we can go to the right or to the left

07:40.000 --> 07:46.892
but in the centre we cannot move right and left, if you are too much futuristic,

07:47.000 --> 07:53.892
if you think too much, if you are working out too much then this right side develops

07:54.000 --> 08:02.892
and this is a very very important thing to understand that we start loosing the balance.

08:03.000 --> 08:10.892
The first thing that happens to a person like that, that he develops a very bad liver,

08:11.000 --> 08:15.892
his liver goes out of order because its the centre which looks after the liver.

08:16.000 --> 08:22.892
Now the heat of the liver when it is. . (created…unclear) start rising

08:23.000 --> 08:28.892
so we might develop asthma very serious type of asthma,

08:29.000 --> 08:37.892
and this is now incurable, but it is curable if you can balance the person it can be easily cured.

08:38.000 --> 08:45.892
This asthma, then if it doesn’t happen then this heat goes towards the heart.

08:46.000 --> 08:52.892
In childhood if you are born with a bad heart or anything then one can understand

08:53.000 --> 09:02.892
but if there is a boy say 21 or 22 years of age who plays tennis and also drinks a lot and all that,

09:03.000 --> 09:08.892
he gets a fatal heart attack, very fatal and he dies

09:09.000 --> 09:18.892
but if it does work out that way gradually it starts moving towards a massive heart attack,

09:19.000 --> 09:27.892
it could be for anyone at any age but especially as the old age starts it can really show its (wishes?. . . unclear).

09:28.000 --> 09:36.892
So this is a common disease we have that our heart is in a trouble,

09:37.000 --> 09:41.892
then you will try peacemaker, this thing, that thing, instead of that if you take to sahajyoga

09:42.000 --> 09:46.892
you don’t have to worry about your heart, it would be excellent.

09:47.000 --> 09:53.892
Then another thing that can happen to you, on the brain side,

09:54.000 --> 10:04.892
that if right side is too much then our left side brain gets affected and we get paraplegia

10:05.000 --> 10:13.892
by which our hand can become absolutely dead also leg can become dead

10:14.000 --> 10:22.892
but it can be a serious paralysis which can affect all the right side right from the mouth to the head,

10:23.000 --> 10:30.892
all this area also hands, legs everything becomes paralyzed,

10:31.000 --> 10:38.892
so this is another thing which is awaiting in such people who don’t care for balancing themselves,

10:39.000 --> 10:44.892
so there are serious diseases, I should say of the upper part of the body.

10:45.000 --> 10:52.892
In the lower part of the body this heat passes towards the pancreas,

10:53.000 --> 10:58.892
so pancreas you get diabetes then it goes little lower

10:59.000 --> 11:02.892
and in the spleen you can get even blood cancer.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.892
Sahajyoga has definitely cured blood cancer, can be cured,

11:08.000 --> 11:14.892
then it can even affect the kidneys, kidneys can be very badly affected

11:15.000 --> 11:22.892
and you might develop kidney troubles, you can try transplantation but didn’t help much

11:23.000 --> 11:34.892
then it comes to your stomach where you get constipated and always in anger, temper.

11:35.000 --> 11:41.892
All these things happen to the right-sided person that he can’t help it

11:42.000 --> 11:49.892
because he is so much busy with his planning and with everything that his brain has no rest

11:50.000 --> 12:00.892
and so he gets irritated when. . (it is something?  unclear) not according to his own desire or his own plans.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.892
With all these things happen, this right-side problem,

12:06.000 --> 12:11.892
I think, is a very serious problem which all of us are facing.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.892
Now it comes, as I told you, comes from our reactions,

12:17.000 --> 12:22.892
so our reactions are because of our mind, now if you have a mind that reacts

12:23.000 --> 12:28.892
then how to stop your mind from reacting.

12:29.000 --> 12:35.892
Einstein has already told that when he was looking for the theory

12:36.000 --> 12:41.892
that he wanted to produce of relativity he got so tired doing it when…(do gardens?  unclear)

12:42.000 --> 12:50.892
started playing with the soap bubbles and suddenly he says from somewhere unknown the whole thing,

12:51.000 --> 12:57.892
the whole scientific explanation came into his mind that he called as a torsion area.

12:58.000 --> 13:05.892
We all have that torsion area, the subtle energy that surrounds us which looks after us

13:06.000 --> 13:13.892
and I call it the divine love that helps us in every way to balance ourselves,

13:14.000 --> 13:18.892
to enrich ourselves and to give the absolute knowledge,

13:19.000 --> 13:21.892
not relative knowledge but absolute knowledge.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.892
So this is the gyaan marga we are talking about of the absolute knowledge.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.892
Now this torsion area is a wonderful thing

13:32.000 --> 13:41.892
because this kundalini when she rises, she not only nourishes all the 6 centres, enlightens them and indicates them

13:42.000 --> 13:46.892
but also connects you to this torsion area of Einstein,

13:47.000 --> 13:54.892
suddenly you are amazed that yourself, how it has happened that you get

13:55.000 --> 14:00.892
so many solutions of problems which are not solvable,

14:01.000 --> 14:04.892
your temperament changes, you are so relaxed,

14:05.000 --> 14:09.892
that means you develop that witness state because now you go beyond your mind,

14:10.000 --> 14:23.892
you don’t react, you see, you just see and watch and its the primarily your attention becomes extremely powerful,

14:24.000 --> 14:31.892
you have all these things within you, just think we have to have, say, some light, it has to be connected.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.892
I am speaking here this instrument has to be connected to the mains,

14:37.000 --> 14:42.892
otherwise it is useless in the same way we are to be connected

14:43.000 --> 14:47.892
we have to decide that we should be connected to that divine power.

14:48.000 --> 14:53.892
Once you are connected to that divine power, its such a change takes place within.

14:54.000 --> 15:05.892
First of all, your hands starts speaking, written in the Quran that at the time of resurrection, kiyama, your hands will speak,

15:06.000 --> 15:09.892
so I say we accept muslim. . (hand should speak?  unclear)

15:10.000 --> 15:15.892
means on your hands on these five fingers, here and here, seven places

15:16.000 --> 15:21.892
you can feel your centers then you can feel the centres of others

15:22.000 --> 15:26.892
because you become a collective being who is the. . (other?  unclear)

15:27.000 --> 15:30.892
you can feel everyone on your fingertips.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.892
A person may look all right to you normal to you but you realize no no he is not

15:36.000 --> 15:42.892
something very serious about that person. On the fingertips you can feel it what’s wrong with that person

15:43.000 --> 15:48.892
Now if you somehow or the other master this side, at the most you take one month,

15:49.000 --> 15:56.892
if you do it you can raise other’s kundalini, that’s how they say sahaja yoga has spread in 86 countries.

15:57.000 --> 16:01.892
It has spread, no doubt, it has spread in 86 countries

16:02.000 --> 16:08.892
but I have not been to all these countries, I have not visited all these countries,

16:09.000 --> 16:12.892
I might have gone to about say about 20 countries at the most

16:13.000 --> 16:16.892
but people who got realized they. . (unclear) in these countries,

16:17.000 --> 16:21.892
they went down to these places and gave realization to another.

16:22.000 --> 16:27.892
Now imagine a country called Benin in Africa has got 7000 Sahaja yogis,

16:28.000 --> 16:35.892
they were all muslims and they all have got realization that doesn’t mean you are no more a muslim,

16:36.000 --> 16:41.892
you are that but you know the essence of so you respect every religion,

16:42.000 --> 16:47.892
you respect all the incarnations because now you have the true knowledge

16:48.000 --> 16:52.892
about religion about yourself and about the whole universe

16:53.000 --> 16:55.892
you can feel it on your fingertips for example.

16:56.000 --> 17:04.892
Supposing a man comes, I would say that once when my husband was a city magistrate,

17:05.000 --> 17:10.892
two ladies came to me from the backdoor and they said see now these police people are putting us into trouble,

17:11.000 --> 17:14.892
we are good women, we have done nothing, I just felt their vibration,

17:15.000 --> 17:20.892
I told my husband that I think you people are doing some injustice to them they are quite alright.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.892
So he said don’t interfere, I said I am not interfering

17:24.000 --> 17:28.892
but I will prove it to you that these girls are innocent and simple girls

17:29.000 --> 17:33.892
and unnecessarily you people are thinking that they are bad women.

17:34.000 --> 17:41.892
So I went with them, that time of course we had only one car, so I went by rickshaw with them

17:42.000 --> 17:47.892
to that place where the man had written that they are bad girls,

17:48.000 --> 17:54.892
so I went and asked him, are these the two girls who are living in your higher upper flat,

17:55.000 --> 17:59.892
are these the girls who did like this, he said not at all, these are very different not these,

18:00.000 --> 18:03.892
then I came and told him, see I judged them from vibrations

18:04.000 --> 18:09.892
and they cannot be bad girls so sometimes also we punish people,

18:10.000 --> 18:14.892
we get angry with people who do not deserve that kind of a treatment

18:15.000 --> 18:19.892
because we don’t know what they are. We also follow wrong paths, we go,

18:20.000 --> 18:24.892
we get lost into so many things because we don’t know what is the right path.

18:25.000 --> 18:30.892
Now with this happening of the kundalini, of course physically you are alright,

18:31.000 --> 18:37.892
physically your problems are solved, physically you don’t have to bother,

18:38.000 --> 18:45.892
actually its hardly any trouble to cure people physically, we also have a hospital

18:46.000 --> 18:51.892
where they don’t charge them anything except for the room where they have to live

18:52.000 --> 18:55.892
and very good rooms also sometimes, the doctors also work free

18:56.000 --> 19:00.892
and work it out so well that so many people have been cured.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.892
We are getting people from all over the world very highly placed people come there

19:06.000 --> 19:12.892
and they are getting cured and for that you don’t have to go to whole. . (unclear) of feeling

19:13.000 --> 19:19.892
“what’s wrong with them, putting them for diagnosis and in that diagnosis only the patient dies halfway

19:20.000 --> 19:24.892
but this is only on the fingertips you know what’s wrong with the person,

19:25.000 --> 19:30.892
you need not tell that person what’s wrong you will know how to cure it and how to work it out.

19:31.000 --> 19:37.892
Today only a friend of ours came to see me, much younger to me looking so very old and haggard

19:38.000 --> 19:44.892
and he said I got paralysis, he was another one of the same kind working too hard,

19:45.000 --> 19:51.892
too hard and within 20 minutes or so after raising his kundalini,

19:52.000 --> 19:57.892
his face became alright, his hands became alright and he said I can’t walk without a stick,

19:58.000 --> 20:03.892
I said alright now you walk, he started walking . I have seen people running

20:04.000 --> 20:08.892
who come on wheelchairs, its very surprising(video disrupted)

20:09.000 --> 20:16.892
but for this we must know this is the knowledge of our country not that other’s didn’t know, they knew,

20:17.000 --> 20:22.892
but in Bolivia, surprised, Bolivia is so far out, people told me we know about chakras,

20:23.000 --> 20:26.892
we know everything but we don’t know how to raise the kundalini,

20:27.000 --> 20:34.892
they knew the word kundalini also, so I thought I must find out who has told you all this,

20:35.000 --> 20:42.892
two saints came from India, long long time back maybe I thought Machindranath and Gorakhnath had gone everywhere,

20:43.000 --> 20:50.892
they went to Ukraine also so they might have told them about this Kundalini and awakening of this Kundalini,

20:51.000 --> 20:53.892
but they said we don’t know how to raise the Kundalini,

20:54.000 --> 21:01.892
once you are entitled as a Sahaja yogi you can raise the Kundalini of any person,

21:02.000 --> 21:10.892
you can cure any person you can do whatever you want to do as far as the physical side is concerned, even the mental side.

21:11.000 --> 21:19.892
I have seen tension is more of mental side of human beings where you get very tensed up, get angry and annoyed

21:20.000 --> 21:25.892
or you become extremely quiet and you don’t know how to handle the situation,

21:26.000 --> 21:30.892
this also is the same reaction of your mind that works it out

21:31.000 --> 21:35.892
but if you go beyond the mind then you will be amazed,

21:36.000 --> 21:41.892
the ideas that they come to you are absolute truth,

21:42.000 --> 21:45.892
the solutions that come to you are absolutely perfect

21:46.000 --> 21:50.892
and the people who are against you become your friend,

21:51.000 --> 21:56.892
those who are troubling you very much also become very very sweet,

21:57.000 --> 22:01.892
its a changing and transforming of human beings.

22:02.000 --> 22:09.892
The other day I had a newspaper and his name was Mr. Abbas alright

22:10.000 --> 22:13.892
so he was extremely aggressive, he asked me funny question,

22:14.000 --> 22:17.892
he say how did you know that you are divine,

22:18.000 --> 22:24.892
I said how did you know you are a human being, he looked at me, I said,

22:25.000 --> 22:30.892
see because I would not react, I used to watch, I used to see, then he found out I am different from others,

22:31.000 --> 22:38.892
so I didn’t tried to show off this thing, there is nobody wants to understand it that way,

22:39.000 --> 22:46.892
you have to prove it, that’s the best way sahaj yoga can be told,

22:47.000 --> 22:53.892
so he said how can I get the proof, he said I don’t believe in any fundamentalism, alright,

22:54.000 --> 22:56.892
don’t believe in any fundamentalism but do you believe in yourself,

22:57.000 --> 23:01.892
yes, yes of course and at that moment his kundalini rised

23:02.000 --> 23:05.892
so he say, ”ye kya ho raha hai?(what is this happening-hindi translation), Whats happening,

23:06.000 --> 23:13.892
what is, how this cool breeze is flowing into my fingertips, how is it, I said it is also flowing out of your frontal bone area

23:14.000 --> 23:18.892
and he was completely changed, he said whatever I have asked you the question

23:19.000 --> 23:27.892
I am not going to put it out, its all nonsense, “hum bewakoof the”(I was stupid-hindi translation) now I have become a sensible man,

23:28.000 --> 23:33.892
you see actually this kundalini shapes you, really transforms you.

23:34.000 --> 23:40.892
Now they say we have six enemies, kaam,  krodh, mad matsar , lobh, moh,

23:41.000 --> 23:43.892
only six they are saying but nowadays there are more

23:44.000 --> 23:46.892
but as it is accepted there are six of them.

23:47.000 --> 23:54.892
So once you get connected with this divine power of love all these things just drop out,

23:55.000 --> 24:00.892
they are useless, no jealousies, no competition, nothing.

24:01.000 --> 24:07.892
We have many people also in the foreign service and they told us people are very happy with us, I said why?

24:08.000 --> 24:13.892
because we are not competing, they are all becoming ambassadors, this and that

24:14.000 --> 24:17.892
but nobody is angry with us because we are not competing.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.892
When the mind starts thinking of the competition,

24:21.000 --> 24:31.892
it can go into any wrong ally into any dark ally or really it can be very much a different person,

24:32.000 --> 24:38.892
but with this you are in the center, you are complete balanced within yourself

24:39.000 --> 24:46.892
and all the hankering everything drops out, you don’t hanker, you don’t hanker after people,

24:47.000 --> 24:56.892
you don’t hanker after great publicity or anything you just automatically become so balanced

24:57.000 --> 25:02.892
and you are not bothered as to what’s happening and that you are not frightened,

25:03.000 --> 25:07.892
for example If I stand in the water you are afraid of the base alright,

25:08.000 --> 25:12.892
but suppose you get into the boat then even you can enjoy the base ,

25:13.000 --> 25:19.892
but supposing you learn how to swim, you can jump down and you can save the people.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.892
This is how Sahaja yoga works, in a simple manner,

25:24.000 --> 25:29.892
as I have said that I have tremendous concern for you people, always had

25:30.000 --> 25:34.892
but because of my husband’s strict rules, i could not touch his office people,

25:35.000 --> 25:42.892
I could not talk to them, I could not meet anyone, who was even a peon involved in the IAS office,

25:43.000 --> 25:45.892
he was very strict about it, I said alright,

25:46.000 --> 25:53.892
I will try some other area but now he has retired luckily, now I am free even to talk to you,

25:54.000 --> 25:57.892
surprisingly, otherwise he would never allow me to talk to you people

25:58.000 --> 26:03.892
because he thought it’s not proper , you must maintain, we must maintain a certain distance.

26:04.000 --> 26:08.892
So even in the parties and all, and all these places,

26:09.000 --> 26:14.892
I was quite amused the way people used to discuss and talk about things you know

26:15.000 --> 26:18.892
and I used to keep quiet so they thought I don’t even know English,

26:19.000 --> 26:23.892
and maybe I am so quiet because perhaps maybe I am good for nothing possible

26:24.000 --> 26:31.892
but now all the same person, those same ladies and gentleman are now doing meditation,

26:32.000 --> 26:40.892
now for meditation you don’t have to hang yourself with anything, you don’t have to have too much time,

26:41.000 --> 26:47.892
even ten minutes before sleeping, you do meditation you will feel so relaxed

26:48.000 --> 26:59.892
and so very absolutely, completely, cleared out of your problems, cleared out of your thinking,

27:00.000 --> 27:07.892
just relaxed, there is no thinking, which is thoughtless awareness as been already told to us

27:08.000 --> 27:12.892
by…(name unclear) you know (name unclear) was a disciple of freud whom he revolted against

27:13.000 --> 27:18.892
and he talked about the mother energy. We Indians you see are shakti pujaris,

27:19.000 --> 27:26.892
now there is this navratras are going on but we have never understood the message of mother’s love,

27:27.000 --> 27:39.892
this is the mother’s love that works I think, and you also become very motherly, very kind, very compassionate,

27:40.000 --> 27:48.892
how can a human being, I don’t know, how can a human being be cruel to anyone who is suffering,

27:49.000 --> 27:58.892
who is in trouble, who is in poverty, the love that you have within yourself starts flowing just like an ocean

27:59.000 --> 28:07.892
and you become extremely generous and all the generous people I have seen are very much always looked after.

28:08.000 --> 28:13.892
I will give you an example of my father who was a very generous man, very very generous man

28:14.000 --> 28:20.892
and once what happened, he always used to say never close the houses, we should not close our house,

28:21.000 --> 28:27.892
always open the windows, open the doors, he said, some thief, if you tell him some thief might come,

28:28.000 --> 28:32.892
he says let them come, after all they need something, that’s why they are coming,

28:33.000 --> 28:37.892
so he used to keep all the doors open, he had a big, he was fond of music

28:38.000 --> 28:45.892
so he had a big gramophone with the one big horn like thing and one day one thief came and opened the door,

28:46.000 --> 28:50.892
it was open, the door was open only, he took away that gramophone,

28:51.000 --> 28:56.892
so next day he was sitting very seriously so my mother said now are you sorry for that,

28:57.000 --> 29:02.892
no no no that I can buy but I am only sorry, this man seems to be. . (unclear) of music

29:03.000 --> 29:06.892
he has taken away the gramophone, now what will he play,

29:07.000 --> 29:13.892
he has not taken any records. So my mother said alright, you advertise in the newspaper,

29:14.000 --> 29:19.892
the one who has taken the gramophone please come and take the records

29:20.000 --> 29:24.892
so that he enjoys the gramophone. I mean I have seen such people,

29:25.000 --> 29:32.892
I have see really very generous people and at the time when Gandhiji declared the war of Independence,

29:33.000 --> 29:38.892
they not only went to jail but they gave away everything.

29:39.000 --> 29:44.892
We used to live in huge big houses then we shifted to some sort of huts,

29:45.000 --> 29:52.892
we were enjoying because you see the enjoyment was of our Rashtra bhakti

29:53.000 --> 29:57.892
and this has helped that time, Mahatma Gandhi was helped

29:58.000 --> 30:00.892
because that time the people were . . (unclear).

30:01.000 --> 30:06.892
Now today, the thing is, it’s coming from the west, too much of this,

30:07.000 --> 30:10.892
too much of that it’s alright, there’s nothing wrong, nothing wrong,

30:11.000 --> 30:15.892
we should come, we should prosper, our country should prosper,

30:16.000 --> 30:21.892
we should create more things at. . (unclear) but this hankering will go away.

30:22.000 --> 30:28.892
Now the hankering becomes the other way round, like what should I give to this lady,

30:29.000 --> 30:33.892
now what should I do for this gentleman, I mean the worry goes to the other side of it,

30:34.000 --> 30:38.892
what to do, what should I gave that they won’t feel wrong

30:39.000 --> 30:43.892
because sometimes you know sarkari naukar’s as they are very strict,

30:44.000 --> 30:47.892
so if you give them they think, I am giving them a bribe, I said this is not a bribe,

30:48.000 --> 30:52.892
I am just giving because I want to give you, will you take it, with very great difficulty they take,

30:53.000 --> 31:01.892
but you see is a way of expression of your love and with this love I tell you,

31:02.000 --> 31:09.892
you will be so very popular, so very popular in your office, in your work,

31:10.000 --> 31:17.892
in the whole of the country people will remember it that this was the man who really looked after us,

31:18.000 --> 31:21.892
who has done so much for you, if you don’t have a concern,

31:22.000 --> 31:25.892
you will be just worried about yourself and this thing.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.892
All the ladies also of the IAS, thank you very much for inviting me

31:30.000 --> 31:33.892
but I would like to tell you that ladies have to help the husbands,

31:34.000 --> 31:39.892
they should try to understand that their energy is the Shakti of energy

31:40.000 --> 31:45.892
and they should give to men this energy so that they can work better

31:46.000 --> 31:50.892
but sometimes I have funny experiences which I’ll relate to you,

31:51.000 --> 31:56.892
which was very interesting that first time, first time, I never know your seniority,

31:57.000 --> 32:00.892
juniority, anything I don’t know much, I don’t understand,

32:01.000 --> 32:04.892
I came to Delhi and when my husband came here to work for Shastriji,

32:05.000 --> 32:10.892
so we met in a party a friend of mine who was from my college,

32:11.000 --> 32:16.892
so she asked me, ”Are, why are you here Nirmal”?

32:17.000 --> 32:19.892
I said my husband has come here, said what is he doing?

32:20.000 --> 32:24.892
I said he is a government servant. Everybody is a government servant here

32:25.000 --> 32:57.892
but what is he doing? I said I don’t know that but he is something here.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.892
What is your husband doing? You could have got a much better husband,

32:38.000 --> 32:41.892
why did you marry a man who takes you to Meena Bagh,

32:42.000 --> 32:46.892
baba I didn’t know Meena Bagh was that bad, you see because Shastriji,

32:47.000 --> 32:52.892
you see asked us to come here and there was no house so they gave us Meena Bagh.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.892
I thought this was very bad to live in Meena Bagh, the way she was talking,

32:57.000 --> 33:01.892
then she said , alright, this gentleman who is coming, this tall gentleman,

32:58.000 --> 33:02.000
Where do you live? First thing she asked, I said I live in Meena Bagh, ahhh, Meena Bagh!!!

33:02.000 --> 33:06.892
you know he is very very important, you somehow or the other mange to talk to him,

33:07.000 --> 33:11.892
he will get your husband a very good job and you will get a very good house

33:12.000 --> 33:17.892
and who comes there was my husband. OH MY GOD !!! She said, ” you know him”?

33:18.000 --> 33:26.892
I said yes. How? He is my husband. After that she didn’t talk to me, she never said it to me.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.892
To know that we live in Meena Bagh was a bad thing in itself,

33:31.000 --> 33:33.892
is a quite a big knowledge about things, isn’t it,

33:34.000 --> 33:39.892
that only people of this much pay live in Meena Bagh, its really impossible.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.892
Even I mean don’t know a state officer knows this much but the lady knew

33:44.000 --> 33:48.892
that Meena Bagh was not meant for an IAS officer.

33:49.000 --> 33:53.892
Can you imagine? So these indulgences of the women is of no use.

33:54.000 --> 34:00.892
I am very happy to hear about this organization that it is doing such a good constructive work.

34:01.000 --> 34:05.892
I was really very happy and myself, he says I am a socialist

34:06.000 --> 34:11.892
because I always think of the social problems and somehow or the other I am a socialist alright,

34:12.000 --> 34:18.892
because it’s a collective sense and when I heard that these people are doing this kind of work,

34:19.000 --> 34:24.892
I said amazing. I can’t imagine those days women used to talk of something else

34:25.000 --> 34:31.892
they would never talk of any social, it was so difficult to make them understand social work.

34:32.000 --> 34:41.892
Funny type of atmosphere was there, the Britishers had left their legacy on our head

34:42.000 --> 34:47.892
and we were quite enamored by that.

34:48.000 --> 34:58.892
For example I would say that it was not for them to conceive of something higher or better,

34:59.000 --> 35:06.892
so I was the president of the blind, friends of the blind society

35:07.000 --> 35:11.892
and for that they were going to have a programme

35:12.000 --> 35:17.892
and these blinds were going to act and the governor Mr. Cheriyat was to come,

35:18.000 --> 35:22.892
when he came they wanted to know who will be sitting next to him,

35:23.000 --> 35:25.892
being a chairman of course others would asked me to sit down

35:26.000 --> 35:31.892
the rest started quarreling and fighting and discussing so much I got such a fright,

35:32.000 --> 35:35.892
I thought now take to humor that’s the best way to solve the problem

35:36.000 --> 35:41.892
so I said alright we will get a big plank on top of the governor’s head

35:42.000 --> 35:48.892
and you all sit like sparrow’s on that, we get all their anger vanished

35:49.000 --> 35:50.892
and they became alright.

35:51.000 --> 35:55.892
So what I am saying is now the quality of women have changed,

35:56.000 --> 35:59.892
you can see that very clearly the quality has changed

36:00.000 --> 36:06.892
and though you might think that they are self centered or whatever you may think

36:07.000 --> 36:11.892
but one thing I have noticed that they are social minded,

36:12.000 --> 36:15.892
they read, they understand whats going on in this country.

36:16.000 --> 36:20.892
I would say these days our country is a very big turmoil,

36:21.000 --> 36:33.892
very big turmoil and all these things are going to help this to solve this problem

36:34.000 --> 36:36.892
so many problems we can solve.

36:37.000 --> 36:46.892
Once some of these problems are solved I am sure we will be one of the greatest countries,

36:47.000 --> 36:50.892
we have no dearth of talent, no dearth of talent,

36:51.000 --> 36:59.892
we have no dearth of hard work only, ” ujaskat tatra durlabhami” means

37:00.000 --> 37:07.892
that there is no way difficult to get a person who can put them to the yojana

37:08.000 --> 37:12.892
and if such a person gets his self realisation he is so self confident,

37:13.000 --> 37:17.892
so peaceful within himself, he is not bothered to what others are doing

37:18.000 --> 37:23.892
and all this can change and transform you into a beautiful personality.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.892
You give up all your destructive habits, absolutely,

37:28.000 --> 37:31.892
you just give up your destructive habits, I don’t have to say give up,

37:32.000 --> 37:36.892
I never say, if I say that half of people might leave me

37:37.000 --> 37:39.892
but I have seen people overnight in London,

37:40.000 --> 37:43.892
there were 12 people who had come who were taking drugs,

37:44.000 --> 37:47.892
they were drug addicts, they left their drugs overnight, overnight!!!

37:48.000 --> 37:52.892
can you imagine. I was amazed how could they leave it overnight ,

37:53.000 --> 37:59.892
our problems of drugs of all other things, we can solve them without any difficulties

38:00.000 --> 38:05.892
and you are placed, you are placed for that, for that kind of job.

38:06.000 --> 38:10.892
Your situation is very good because you have a responsibility,

38:11.000 --> 38:15.892
very great responsibility and that responsibility has to be understood,

38:16.000 --> 38:20.892
if we do not understand our responsibility will not(audio disrupted),

38:21.000 --> 38:25.892
but once you get your realisation, you will, you will become extremely responsible

38:26.000 --> 38:30.892
and also you will not feel that responsibility on your head,

38:31.000 --> 38:36.892
you will extremely, absolutely relaxed and such a person to meet,

38:37.000 --> 38:40.892
you are sometimes surprised the face changes, the body changes,

38:41.000 --> 38:45.892
everything, the transformation takes place and you are surprised,

38:46.000 --> 38:52.892
all this, all this is within you, all this you have got it, all this is working out,

38:53.000 --> 38:57.892
only thing, we have to get our self-realisation,

38:58.000 --> 39:05.892
this is a knowledge of our inner being, a very subtle knowledge.

39:06.000 --> 39:12.892
I pray and thank you very much, to all the ladies also for calling me here,

39:13.000 --> 39:19.892
this is a very unique experience I have, because I would never known that IAS people

39:20.000 --> 39:23.892
could be so receptive to this kind of a subtle thing,

39:24.000 --> 39:27.892
but they are. In Bombay, I was surprised, when I had this programme in Bombay,

39:28.000 --> 39:33.892
now they are regularly going for meditation in a hall that they have,

39:34.000 --> 39:39.892
surprising, how can they do it I don’t know but they are doing it,

39:40.000 --> 39:44.892
the way they have received me. Actually I used to always say that Bombay

39:45.000 --> 39:51.892
IAS people are very, very proud, I should say, very proud,

39:52.000 --> 39:56.892
they wont look at you, they wont see you but I have a surprise,

39:57.000 --> 40:01.892
they have become so humble, so nice,

40:02.000 --> 40:08.892
I don’t know why in Bombay they have developed this kind of a superiority complex or something,

40:09.000 --> 40:14.892
we had very bad reports about them but suddenly they have changed so much

40:15.000 --> 40:19.892
and in the same way you all should change and you become so collective,

40:20.000 --> 40:24.892
its not joint, its collective and you just think of helping each other

40:25.000 --> 40:31.892
and living that kind of a life and all over the world we have brothers

40:32.000 --> 40:36.892
and sisters, wherever you go, you may go anywhere you will find them waiting for you ,

40:37.000 --> 40:42.892
they also come here and when they come here they touch this motherland of ours,

40:43.000 --> 40:49.892
they touch this Bharat Bhumi with their lips and kiss it.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.892
I asked them why do you do it, because its a yog bhumi,

40:54.000 --> 41:00.892
its a special country, its a yog bhumi, here we have got our realisation

41:01.000 --> 41:05.892
and you will be amazed that this country is a yog bhumi

41:06.000 --> 41:08.892
Once I was travelling with my husband in the plane

41:09.000 --> 41:12.892
and I told him we have reached India, he said how do you know?

41:13.000 --> 41:17.892
I see the vibrations all over, you can see, he went to the pilot to verify,

41:18.000 --> 41:21.892
to verify what I was saying was correct or not.

41:22.000 --> 41:27.892
The pilot said sir we have, we have, I said see, this is our surrounding

41:28.000 --> 41:34.892
which has spirituality in it, everything that is written we have to verify

41:35.000 --> 41:40.892
why some places are Swayambhus, how can you make it out,

41:41.000 --> 41:45.892
anywhere you go there is a temple, there is a temple, how do you?

41:46.000 --> 41:49.892
You can feel it on your fingertips.

41:50.000 --> 41:56.892
Now you will be surprised to know that Mecca has got a big stone, a black stone.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.892
Mohammad Sahab said don’t worship any stone

42:00.000 --> 42:04.892
because people used to make money out of making some statues and all

42:05.000 --> 42:07.892
but this stone he said you should go round,

42:08.000 --> 42:11.892
that is the biggest and foremost thing to go round the stone.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.892
Now ask them why do you go and worship the stone, they don’t know,

42:15.000 --> 42:21.892
but I know because in our shastras it is written that its a Macceshwar Shiva.

42:22.000 --> 42:26.892
It is a Shiva called, even vibrations, you see vibrations starts flowing.

42:27.000 --> 42:32.892
Its a Mecceshwar Shiva. Its a Shiva in the stone,

42:33.000 --> 42:35.892
its the vibrations of the Shiva and its a fact.

42:36.000 --> 42:40.892
The other day I read in very nice article in Marathi that

42:41.000 --> 42:45.892
Shiva was worshiped before Islamic religion came

42:46.000 --> 42:51.892
but the way they were doing it because they were going to all kinds of temples and rituals,

42:52.000 --> 42:56.892
too many rituals and because of that ritualism,

42:57.000 --> 42:59.892
Mohammad Sahab said don’t worship the stone,

43:00.000 --> 43:03.892
but we have Swayambhus, we have really Swayambhus

43:04.000 --> 43:08.892
but when you will go and verify with your vibrations you will know they are swayambhus.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.892
You all are capable of getting self realization, all of you,

43:13.000 --> 43:17.892
whatever must be your past, doesn’t matter, we have to be in the present,

43:18.000 --> 43:22.892
past is finished, future doesn’t exist, you will be in the present

43:23.000 --> 43:26.892
and that’s the reality which you all can feel the vibrations…(video disrupted)

43:27.000 --> 43:33.892
to bother him all his life, so one should not have any such ideas

43:34.000 --> 43:40.892
that I have done this wrong, how can I get realization, this is unnecessary,

43:41.000 --> 43:46.892
you should not, you should never, never think that you are guilty,

43:47.000 --> 43:51.892
if you were you would have been in the jail, but you have been here

43:52.000 --> 43:57.892
so don’t think you are guilty, don’t judge yourself, you don’t know yourself,

43:58.000 --> 44:02.892
it is to know yourself you have to do this and don’t judge,

44:03.000 --> 44:05.892
you must have great respect and love for yourself

44:06.000 --> 44:10.892
and I am sure it will work out tonight as desired by these people

44:11.000 --> 44:15.892
but those who don’t want to have self realization, I would say they can go

44:16.000 --> 44:20.892
because I don’t want them to disturb others, supposing

44:21.000 --> 44:24.892
if you don’t want it cannot be forced, it has to be asked for,

44:25.000 --> 44:28.892
it cannot be forced to anyone, you cannot pay for it,

44:29.000 --> 44:33.892
you cannot do anything about it but if the kundalini doesn’t rise,

44:34.000 --> 44:39.892
it’s alright we have a center where you can go and get it corrected maybe

44:40.000 --> 44:42.892
something wrong in the chakras which you do not know

44:43.000 --> 44:48.892
and they will find out. So it will take hardly anytime anytime,

44:49.000 --> 44:56.892
have faith in yourself, first of all have faith in yourself and this will work out,

44:57.000 --> 45:03.892
first I think to forgive others is difficult, you see the western people,

45:04.000 --> 45:09.892
they cannot forgive themselves and for Indians the other way round,

45:10.000 --> 45:18.892
they cannot forgive others, I don’t know there is this kind of different I mean, attitude,

45:19.000 --> 45:21.892
but we should forgive ourselves also.

45:22.000 --> 45:27.892
God has created you as human beings not to be ruined like this,

45:28.000 --> 45:33.892
not to be shattered like this but to achieve your goal.

45:36.000 --> 45:36.892
REALIZATION

45:56.000 --> 45:58.892
You have to just put your hands towards me like this.

45:59.000 --> 46:04.892
I think if you have shoes, you have to take it out, helps us a lot,

46:05.000 --> 46:16.892
we are sitting in Delhi where, here at this Bharat Bhumi in this Yog Bhumi it works very fast.

46:17.000 --> 46:21.892
In this country it works very fast and also with you people

46:22.000 --> 46:25.892
because you love this country very much you work so hard for this country,

46:26.000 --> 46:31.892
so it works very fast, so don’t have any apprehensions,

46:32.000 --> 46:37.892
just put your both the hands like this.

46:53.000 --> 46:57.892
Again I would request, you must forgive yourself and others,

46:58.000 --> 47:03.892
that’s very important because if you don’t do that then your center here,

47:04.000 --> 47:11.892
will call the Vishuddhi Chakra, will be blocked.

47:12.000 --> 47:16.892
I mean the guilt part is blocked and if you don’t forgive,

47:17.000 --> 47:19.892
then this Agnya Chakra will be blocked.

47:42.000 --> 47:48.892
Please put your hands like this, little lower, now,

48:06.000 --> 48:12.892
first you will start feeling some cool or hot breeze on your fingertips

48:13.000 --> 48:23.892
and also on your thumb, then in the palm you start feeling a cool or a hot breeze,

48:24.000 --> 48:28.892
some people start thinking that this is air-conditioning, it has nothing to do with air-conditioning,

48:29.000 --> 48:32.892
so please have faith in yourself.

48:43.000 --> 48:51.892
Now please put right hand towards me and put down, put your, put down your head a little

48:52.000 --> 49:01.892
and feel with your left hand on top of your frontal bone area which was called as Talu,

49:02.000 --> 49:06.892
if there’s a cool or a hot breeze coming out,

49:07.000 --> 49:10.892
now please put down your heads a little and see for yourself,

49:11.000 --> 49:16.892
move your hand, it might be coming very far, maybe very close

49:17.000 --> 49:21.892
but don’t put your hand on top but above, just move please,

49:22.000 --> 49:29.892
move it on the sides and see for yourself that there is cool or a hot breeze like coming.

49:30.000 --> 49:36.892
It is hot means you have not forgiven, it means only that you have to really say I forgive,

49:37.000 --> 49:41.892
you don’t have to do anything except you have to say in your heart I forgive everyone,

49:42.000 --> 49:46.892
that’s a very great quality.

49:47.000 --> 49:51.892
Now please put your left hands towards me

49:52.000 --> 49:55.892
and see with your right hand again bend your head please

49:56.000 --> 50:03.892
and see for yourself, if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head,

50:04.000 --> 50:10.892
just see for yourself. Please put your right hand again, right hand is more,

50:11.000 --> 50:19.892
so put the right hand like this and see for yourself.

50:40.000 --> 50:45.892
Now again put both the hands towards me and don’t think,

50:46.000 --> 50:53.892
just don’t think, you can stop thinking even for a second, that’s very good,

50:54.000 --> 51:00.892
this is called as Nirvicharita, then comes a stage you become Nirvikalpa,

51:01.000 --> 51:05.892
when there is no doubt in your head, you become into doubtless awareness

51:06.000 --> 51:09.892
where you sure you got it, you sure you can do everything,

51:10.000 --> 51:14.892
that is the stage one has to rise.

51:18.000 --> 51:27.892
Now all those who have felt on their fingertips a cool or a hot breeze

51:28.000 --> 51:35.892
or out of the frontal bone area cool or a hot breeze

51:36.000 --> 51:40.892
please raise both your hands.

51:46.000 --> 51:50.892
Most of you have got it, most of you have got it.

51:51.000 --> 51:57.892
Congratulations and those who haven’t got will also get it,

51:58.000 --> 52:05.892
if you have to just little bit join of the centers we have

52:06.000 --> 52:11.892
or if you want any one of them can come and give a realization.

52:12.000 --> 52:16.892
I don’t think there is any hindrance in that but sometimes it happens

52:17.000 --> 52:23.892
that she didn’t rise, she is your mother individual mother,

52:24.000 --> 52:29.892
she doesn’t have any other child, this kundalini knows everything about you,

52:30.000 --> 52:34.892
she knows your aspirations, she knows your past , she knows everything,

52:35.000 --> 52:38.892
also she knows what physical problems you have, she is very kind,

52:39.000 --> 52:45.892
as your mother she gave you the birth, she took up all the labor pains upon herself,

52:46.000 --> 52:50.892
it’s the kundalini that out of her love, that motherly love she does everything

52:51.000 --> 53:00.892
and it just works, it works because thats what you are in for,

53:01.000 --> 53:04.892
time has come for all of us to be transformed,

53:05.000 --> 53:12.892
to get into a new generation of beautiful people , it’s a wonderful time,

53:13.000 --> 53:20.892
if I have done anything so far is this that I found out a way for collective awareness,

53:21.000 --> 53:24.892
that’s the only work I have done, otherwise it was already there,

53:25.000 --> 53:30.892
Nathpantis used to do it, it was quite a well known thing about people

53:31.000 --> 53:34.892
but what I have done is I have tried to find out

53:35.000 --> 53:39.892
what are the permutations and combinations of problem in the human beings

53:40.000 --> 53:48.892
and why should they all get it, this collective happening has been a great blessing all over the world.

53:49.000 --> 53:52.892
Again I would like to thank you very much,

53:53.000 --> 53:57.892
very kind of you that you had invited me here,

53:58.000 --> 54:02.892
if you have any questions also if you can spare some time,

54:03.000 --> 54:06.892
I would like to know if you have any questions.

54:13.000 --> 55:44.892
Ques: Mataji, I wanted to know do we have to have a certain posture for meditation or you can meditate in any way?

55:45.000 --> 55:48.892
Shri Mataji: No there is nothing, no style, nothing.

55:49.000 --> 55:52.892
You can sit whichever way you like, you can sit on the chair, you can do I mean,

55:53.000 --> 55:56.892
there is no style nothing. I didn’t understand your question

55:57.000 --> 56:01.892
what you are saying so I was asking him, there is nothing like that, you see,

56:02.000 --> 56:06.892
you are beyond all this things now, you don’t have to worry as to how u sit down,

56:07.000 --> 56:11.892
what you do, nothing, you sit anywhere you like, if you want you can sit on the ground,

56:12.000 --> 56:21.892
if you want you can sit on the chair, anywhere, its all over.

56:22.000 --> 56:33.892
Sorry I couldn’t understand your question. This is not a problem.

56:34.000 --> 56:41.892
“Aap to nirbandh hai, mast huye to fir kya bole, hai na. ”

57:32.000 --> 57:36.892
Ques: Mataji, there are so many gurus nowadays,

57:37.000 --> 57:44.892
how one will convince the others, if I have to tell someone to come to you, how do I tell them?

57:45.000 --> 57:49.892
Shri Mataji: You don’t have to convince, you see there is no need to convince them

57:50.000 --> 57:54.892
because they will see you as something special,

57:55.000 --> 58:03.892
very different and they will ask you how are you so peaceful, how are you so good,

58:04.000 --> 58:09.892
don’t have to tell them, just they will see your character, your style

58:10.000 --> 58:14.892
and they will be so impressed by you.

58:24.000 --> 58:29.892
Very positive questions, very very positive,

58:30.000 --> 58:39.892
because once you get it you want others to get it because you find others in trouble.

58:40.000 --> 58:44.892
We have one gentleman here who wants to sing song for you,

58:45.000 --> 58:52.892
I hope you will enjoy and I think song will soothe it down.

59:19.000 --> 59:26.892
He is a musician who has, had no guru, didn’t learned any music,

59:27.000 --> 59:32.892
some or other after Sahaj yoga, he developed the art of music from within.

59:33.000 --> 59:37.892
People become poets, all kinds of things happen, he is one of them

59:38.000 --> 59:43.892
who has achieved a great success in music without going to any guru,

59:44.000 --> 59:47.892
without learning anything, A B C D and all that.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:49.892
“BHAJAN:Jisme surat shri maa ki na aaye nazar, aisa darpan mujhe nahi chahye. ”

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:40.892
“BHAJAN:Sahaji hume banaya ye karam nahi to kya hai. ”

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:42.000
……. End…….
