1
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,939
So now we come to the left
side then to the right side.

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,862
Right side is the action, the power of action,
is the Surya Nadi, is the channel of the sun.

3
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,200
When you want to enact your desire,

4
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:32,294
manifest it, then you use this action
power, Iccha Shakti is called in Sanskrit.

5
00:00:32,294 --> 00:00:36,360
Now this power works mainly
through this second center,

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,820
or we call it the third center, actually it
is the third because the second one is that.

7
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:48,420
This center is called as Swadishthana and
this center has got six, you can see six

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,900
plexuses, it’s like the Star of David.

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,480
Moses preached something, and
Jews are doing something else.

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,740
Christ preached something, and
Christians are doing something else.

11
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:10,720
Adi Shankaracharya taught something,
and Hindus are doing just the opposite.

12
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,220
Mohammed taught something, and
they did just the opposite.

13
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,300
It’s not only in religion, in every
way you see how we are perverted.

14
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:29,147
Like this center is used for converting the
fat in your stomach for the use of your brain.

15
00:01:29,232 --> 00:01:32,502
Now, do we realize that our brain is made of fat?

16
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,880
Do we know all our nerves are made of fat?

17
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,220
Now there’s a general principle in this country

18
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,120
that you should not use any
butter, which is very wrong.

19
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,200
When you don’t use any butter how are you
going to supply this brain with something,

20
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,204
I mean where will you get it,
it’s completely drained out.

21
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,340
You use your brain so much, so much so,

22
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,580
that this poor center has to work only for
your thinking which has no productivity.

23
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:07,620
You just go on thinking, thinking, thinking,
thinking; two horns come out of your head of

24
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:12,480
thinking; still you are thinking, and they
go on growing, you cannot stop your thinking.

25
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,432
And what are you thinking, what
have you got out of your thinking?

26
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:25,500
This right side is the one which is our
five elements also, five elements within us.

27
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:33,240
So when we started discovering what
is the essence of the five elements,

28
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,500
in India we started the Vedas
thousands of years back,

29
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,940
and the effect of that is shown now, is
the science, you discovered, the science.

30
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,457
That you understood how to
master these five elements.
