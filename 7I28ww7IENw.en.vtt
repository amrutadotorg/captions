00:12:06.474 --> 00:12:12.604
In India they were all waiting for the monsoons

00:12:14.354 --> 00:12:16.804
and they are so worried

00:12:18.144 --> 00:12:20.434
because the rain did not come.

00:12:21.604 --> 00:12:26.474
So, I was giving bandhan to the rain and it came here

00:12:39.604 --> 00:12:43.304
And now also they have  told,

00:12:43.764 --> 00:12:47.434
on the television, that it is going to rain in India.

00:12:48.554 --> 00:12:50.554
But first in Italy!

00:12:56.764 --> 00:13:00.764
I was told that in Italy you needed rain very much

00:13:01.644 --> 00:13:04.604
and the first rain you had,

00:13:07.514 --> 00:13:12.474
few days back, and now this the second one.

00:13:13.804 --> 00:13:22.354
Because all the understanding

00:13:23.764 --> 00:13:32.224
of the problems of our farmers is there.

00:13:35.144 --> 00:13:38.224
And the rain, you see, is so kind

00:13:39.764 --> 00:13:46.474
that it works at the right time.

00:13:47.804 --> 00:13:49.764
I am surprised

00:13:51.144 --> 00:13:58.104
at the quick behaviour and obedience of the rain.

00:14:03.104 --> 00:14:06.644
Today is a great day, for all of us,  because

00:14:07.304 --> 00:14:11.554
we are celebrating the Guru Puja

00:14:12.434 --> 00:14:15.394
and remembering all the great Gurus

00:14:16.684 --> 00:14:22.644
who came on this earth to teach the world about the truth.

00:14:24.514 --> 00:14:27.474
So many of them were [there].

00:14:28.554 --> 00:14:30.684
And they tried their level best

00:14:31.764 --> 00:14:35.644
to explain to humanity what is spirituality.

00:14:37.144 --> 00:14:43.144
But it’s such a disparity that people never understood

00:14:43.684 --> 00:14:48.104
that spirituality is the most important thing we need.

00:14:49.224 --> 00:14:52.394
That we have to be one with the Divine Power.

00:14:53.184 --> 00:14:57.144
All their endeavours have been in the wrong direction.

00:14:59.434 --> 00:15:06.434
First of course they were very intelligent, more than animals,

00:15:07.144 --> 00:15:13.474
and started seeking, not the truth,

00:15:14.604 --> 00:15:17.474
but some sort of a self

00:15:18.304 --> 00:15:21.514
-emancipation I should say, I don’t know  what to say, call it –

00:15:22.434 --> 00:15:24.514
self-progress.

00:15:25.644 --> 00:15:30.434
And in that they lost that they have to first seek spirituality,

00:15:31.394 --> 00:15:33.604
which is the most important thing.

00:15:36.104 --> 00:15:44.304
But, we had two types of journeys:

00:15:46.144 --> 00:15:54.184
one is through the left side or another through the right side.

00:15:56.304 --> 00:15:59.224
In India, I don’t know why,

00:15:59.644 --> 00:16:05.644
we had lots of people who went into the jungles and became saints

00:16:06.764 --> 00:16:10.554
but they were doing right side tapasya.

00:16:12.434 --> 00:16:17.514
That is, going into the five elements

00:16:18.764 --> 00:16:23.514
one after another; and mastering the five elements.

00:16:24.554 --> 00:16:29.434
Of course there is truth in it, no doubt.

00:16:30.514 --> 00:16:33.644
You have seen how a candle

00:16:39.724 --> 00:16:45.724
how a candle tells you as to what is your position inside:

00:16:47.104 --> 00:16:50.224
if you are possessed or if you are not,

00:16:50.514 --> 00:16:53.394
a candle can tell you – can you imagine?

00:16:54.264 --> 00:16:59.394
Candle is so much knowledgable.

00:17:00.644 --> 00:17:07.684
Supposing you have a heart, heart trouble –

00:17:08.304 --> 00:17:10.304
the candle will show.

00:17:11.804 --> 00:17:18.804
And if you treat yourself with a candle, you can cure yourself.

00:17:20.394 --> 00:17:25.394
So, it is so sensitive

00:17:25.804 --> 00:17:29.764
not that it can cure, but also so competent,

00:17:30.604 --> 00:17:34.514
not that it shows you that you are sick and you have problems

00:17:34.684 --> 00:17:37.474
but that it is competent to cure you.

00:17:39.434 --> 00:17:46.354
Thats why, in India, Agni was worshipped,

00:17:47.224 --> 00:17:53.264
this  light was worshipped,

00:17:53.604 --> 00:17:57.354
the fire was worshipped, that was worshipped first.

00:17:59.304 --> 00:18:05.264
They must have discovered that the fire knows everything,

00:18:08.144 --> 00:18:14.394
so the inner, inner awareness of all these elements,

00:18:15.724 --> 00:18:21.604
they knew about it and thats why they worshipped those elements.

00:18:22.804 --> 00:18:30.474
So before the Puja they used to call all the Deities who belonged

00:18:31.264 --> 00:18:36.684
to those elements to witness their Puja.

00:18:38.724 --> 00:18:41.724
But that turned out to be right sided movement.

00:18:45.644 --> 00:18:50.684
Without the left side right side is very dangerous.

00:18:53.764 --> 00:18:58.434
If you don’t have right side of course

00:18:59.224 --> 00:19:04.304
it’s a big dangerous thing also. But first you must have

00:19:05.434 --> 00:19:08.434
development of your left side.

00:19:10.604 --> 00:19:13.684
That is what, to begin with, we had in Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:14.804 --> 00:19:22.604
Left side is compassion, is love, universal feeling,

00:19:24.434 --> 00:19:29.354
or we can say it’s the blessings of the Devi

00:19:30.144 --> 00:19:34.474
which are described you know it, in the Devi Mahatmyam,

00:19:35.474 --> 00:19:40.354
that the Goddess resides within you as so many things.

00:19:42.394 --> 00:19:45.514
She resides within you as shraddha.

00:19:46.354 --> 00:19:50.474
as, She resides in you as sleep,

00:19:52.104 --> 00:19:55.644
She resides in you as illusion, bhranti.

00:19:55.804 --> 00:19:59.474
All kinds of things are there on the left-hand side,

00:19:59.804 --> 00:20:02.724
which are already described.

00:20:03.554 --> 00:20:08.144
And when I told you about Sahaja Yoga,

00:20:08.554 --> 00:20:12.394
I wanted to make your left side very strong.

00:20:13.724 --> 00:20:17.434
Those who, people who, took to right side

00:20:17.764 --> 00:20:22.644
became very aggressive people, and they had mastered

00:20:23.184 --> 00:20:27.354
the essence of these five elements, that’s alright. But

00:20:28.514 --> 00:20:31.474
they were extremely hot-tempered,

00:20:32.434 --> 00:20:37.554
so much so that they used to curse people, curse them.

00:20:38.434 --> 00:20:43.394
They used to say things which were not kind;

00:20:44.304 --> 00:20:47.224
and they didn’t believe in the universality.

00:20:48.644 --> 00:20:53.684
It was such a dangerous thing that they took.

00:20:55.224 --> 00:20:59.394
In Indian shastras you can see many incidents

00:21:00.144 --> 00:21:04.804
where people gave a curse, sharp, very common.

00:21:05.644 --> 00:21:09.394
All these gurus used to curse a person,

00:21:11.434 --> 00:21:16.604
because they had no compassion, no love, nothing but they had powers

00:21:16.804 --> 00:21:21.354
of the right side. But we have seen now

00:21:22.104 --> 00:21:24.354
that those people who have right side,

00:21:24.644 --> 00:21:27.684
who go only on the right side without the bhakti,

00:21:28.554 --> 00:21:34.184
without the blessings of the Divine,

00:21:36.354 --> 00:21:38.514
can become rakshasas actually,

00:21:40.724 --> 00:21:45.724
can become a great danger for humanity.

00:21:53.434 --> 00:21:57.804
This is a very serious thing:

00:21:59.474 --> 00:22:04.354
through your intelligence, through your thinking power,

00:22:04.514 --> 00:22:07.554
your ego can go to any limit

00:22:08.474 --> 00:22:11.434
and create problems within you.

00:22:12.304 --> 00:22:15.304
Now the ultimate of this problem is,

00:22:16.224 --> 00:22:19.224
we have seen is, are many diseases,

00:22:19.514 --> 00:22:22.434
which are absolutely incurable.

00:22:25.644 --> 00:22:29.394
Even some people, right-sided, some people,

00:22:29.764 --> 00:22:34.514
can get a kind of a cancer called blood cancer.

00:22:35.764 --> 00:22:38.724
And this blood cancer, now we have cured it,

00:22:39.514 --> 00:22:42.804
but even if it is cured you can go back

00:22:43.264 --> 00:22:45.554
to that kind of aggressiveness

00:22:45.804 --> 00:22:48.354
thinking that you are very right.

00:22:49.144 --> 00:22:52.264
Such people always try to find faults with others,

00:22:53.644 --> 00:23:01.104
that such and such person is not good, he’s doing harm,

00:23:01.394 --> 00:23:05.304
or any way they can find faults with others, not with themselves.

00:23:06.144 --> 00:23:09.474
Their attention is outside, not on themselves.

00:23:09.764 --> 00:23:12.304
They never see what’s wrong with them,

00:23:12.474 --> 00:23:15.554
but they always see what’s wrong with others.

00:23:16.144 --> 00:23:19.354
By doing that, you see, they are climbing the ladder

00:23:20.144 --> 00:23:25.554
of a horrible right side, which can give you horrible diseases.

00:23:26.554 --> 00:23:29.224
As I’ve told you, first is the blood cancer.

00:23:30.684 --> 00:23:35.474
If you get rid of the blood cancer then

00:23:36.224 --> 00:23:41.604
you can get into another problems. Nowadays there’s a very famous

00:23:42.104 --> 00:23:44.554
disease called Alzheimers.

00:23:45.804 --> 00:23:48.554
This is also the side of the right side;

00:23:49.434 --> 00:23:53.264
because if you don’t have that bhakti, that humility,

00:23:54.224 --> 00:23:58.304
that blessings of the Goddess,

00:23:59.224 --> 00:24:03.224
you can develop all such horrible diseases

00:24:03.644 --> 00:24:06.264
which are not only fatal,

00:24:07.144 --> 00:24:10.144
but also very injurious to others.

00:24:10.724 --> 00:24:17.184
So by being right-sided you do not progress.

00:24:17.804 --> 00:24:22.184
You can become a big ascetic, they call it,

00:24:23.264 --> 00:24:26.684
who can curse others,

00:24:27.644 --> 00:24:32.304
who can put them into troubles,

00:24:34.264 --> 00:24:37.354
think that that is a great power – it is not!

00:24:38.804 --> 00:24:40.804
It is not at all.

00:24:41.724 --> 00:24:47.604
Because, though you are not suppressed

00:24:48.554 --> 00:24:51.644
by other powers, negative powers,

00:24:52.804 --> 00:24:58.224
but your own power takes your life.

00:25:01.724 --> 00:25:05.224
So Kundalini, when it is arisen,

00:25:06.304 --> 00:25:10.264
the best thing is to go to the left side,

00:25:12.144 --> 00:25:17.104
not criticising others, not talking ill of others,

00:25:17.514 --> 00:25:20.434
but seeing within you, what’s wrong.

00:25:22.684 --> 00:25:27.804
Find out what is the matter with you.

00:25:29.224 --> 00:25:31.724
First it starts with self-importance,

00:25:32.644 --> 00:25:35.144
that “I am a very important person,”

00:25:36.144 --> 00:25:39.264
and with this self-importance you go on

00:25:39.724 --> 00:25:43.604
troubling everyone and torturing everyone, and all that.

00:25:44.224 --> 00:25:47.144
But because of your right-side movement,

00:25:48.144 --> 00:25:50.554
you can become very successful.

00:25:51.394 --> 00:25:54.264
Hitler was the climax of that.

00:25:55.724 --> 00:26:02.224
And that’s how people start taking to very, very cruel things.

00:26:04.184 --> 00:26:09.264
Nowadays, I think that some people are

00:26:12.104 --> 00:26:18.144
ruling  everywhere with their right side.

00:26:20.184 --> 00:26:27.224
We do not have people who are using their left side.

00:26:28.554 --> 00:26:33.474
And whenever they use their left side they are called as saints.

00:26:35.224 --> 00:26:38.474
Now you all have the powers of the left side.

00:26:39.604 --> 00:26:44.264
Some of you do have little bit right side also, doesn’t matter.

00:26:48.554 --> 00:26:52.394
Now I would say that you have achieved

00:26:52.684 --> 00:26:55.144
your left side mastery:

00:26:56.554 --> 00:27:00.434
Kundalini awakening is there, you are one with the Divine.

00:27:00.764 --> 00:27:05.684
Now you can come to the right side and know about right side,

00:27:08.144 --> 00:27:12.144
and try to express your right side.

00:27:13.644 --> 00:27:18.184
You can express it not by dominating others but dominating yourself.

00:27:18.684 --> 00:27:20.644
By self-examination.

00:27:21.604 --> 00:27:26.434
By understanding what’s wrong with you. Why do you behave like that?

00:27:27.224 --> 00:27:33.434
Why do you trouble others? Why do you overpower others?

00:27:34.184 --> 00:27:37.184
Such people will always, I have seen, organise

00:27:37.394 --> 00:27:39.644
and arrange, and do this and do that.

00:27:41.514 --> 00:27:44.604
Instead of organising themselves they’ll organise others.

00:27:46.224 --> 00:27:48.554
These things complicate.

00:27:51.144 --> 00:27:55.764
But if you have love and if you have bhakti,

00:27:56.264 --> 00:27:59.264
you can very, very easily

00:28:02.434 --> 00:28:08.354
dominate  others in a very different manner.

00:28:10.644 --> 00:28:17.554
It is not that you dominate by cruelty,

00:28:19.434 --> 00:28:25.394
by oppression, but you dominate with your love.

00:28:27.264 --> 00:28:29.514
And you don’t want to dominate,

00:28:30.264 --> 00:28:33.354
but easily people get very much succumbed

00:28:34.264 --> 00:28:40.264
to love and to magnanimity, to generosity.

00:28:41.474 --> 00:28:45.434
So all these qualities you must first develop within yourself:

00:28:46.304 --> 00:28:51.224
is the left-side problem, that – you should be very peaceful,

00:28:52.394 --> 00:28:56.394
you should give love to others, you should be generous,

00:28:57.224 --> 00:29:02.264
you should be kind, and see how much it means.

00:29:03.804 --> 00:29:08.684
I’ve seen some people who are extremely rude,

00:29:10.684 --> 00:29:14.474
they can be rude to anyone, that’s their nature,

00:29:15.224 --> 00:29:18.144
which they should overcome with the left side.

00:29:19.104 --> 00:29:21.684
Rudeness is not the sign of a saint.

00:29:23.304 --> 00:29:25.604
A saint is extremely peaceful,

00:29:26.434 --> 00:29:29.604
and never gets rude with others.

00:29:30.354 --> 00:29:33.434
So the introspection should work first of all,

00:29:34.104 --> 00:29:37.554
“Where are we wrong? What wrong things we are doing?

00:29:38.514 --> 00:29:40.394
What is our style?”

00:29:41.394 --> 00:29:45.394
Once you discover that your style is already left-side,

00:29:45.804 --> 00:29:48.434
then you should take to right side

00:29:48.724 --> 00:29:51.554
and possess the power of right side.

00:29:59.224 --> 00:30:02.144
What are the powers of right side now

00:30:03.394 --> 00:30:09.224
which are achieved through the left-side perfection?

00:30:10.514 --> 00:30:14.474
We have some very great Gurus on this line.

00:30:15.554 --> 00:30:19.474
One of them was Raja Janaka.

00:30:21.644 --> 00:30:24.144
He was a ruler of a country,

00:30:24.474 --> 00:30:30.604
and a very well-known ruler and everything; but still, still,

00:30:31.604 --> 00:30:35.264
though He was so generous and good and everything,

00:30:36.514 --> 00:30:42.304
but at the same time He was a great monarch,

00:30:42.554 --> 00:30:46.644
great king of those days,

00:30:48.644 --> 00:30:55.474
very much known for His impartiality,  for His statesmanship

00:30:56.264 --> 00:31:01.684
and all kinds of beautiful things He did for His

00:31:05.724 --> 00:31:11.144
subjects. That is there, is Raja Janaka.

00:31:11.304 --> 00:31:13.684
He could not get disturbed with anything.

00:31:15.514 --> 00:31:18.264
And people never understood

00:31:18.434 --> 00:31:22.394
why the greatest of greatest saints used to bow to Him.

00:31:23.304 --> 00:31:28.554
What was so great? Though He was a king, He was living so lavishly

00:31:29.394 --> 00:31:33.144
and He had so many of ornaments and

00:31:33.474 --> 00:31:36.354
also conveyances and all that;

00:31:37.354 --> 00:31:40.554
because nothing was above Him,

00:31:41.474 --> 00:31:43.554
He was so detached with everything.

00:31:44.394 --> 00:31:48.224
He had everything, but He was so detached.

00:31:48.604 --> 00:31:51.394
That’s a very good example of a person

00:31:51.724 --> 00:31:57.144
who had mastered His left, and now who was the king,

00:31:57.354 --> 00:31:59.264
Raja Janaka, was there.

00:31:59.724 --> 00:32:03.434
Like that we had many people later on also,

00:32:04.304 --> 00:32:10.394
one after another, who were extremely, extremely rich,

00:32:11.224 --> 00:32:16.724
extremely, I should say, powerful as kings,

00:32:17.354 --> 00:32:21.304
but inside they were

00:32:21.644 --> 00:32:27.224
absolutely like divine personality.

00:32:28.804 --> 00:32:34.224
Nothing disturbed them, nothing made them feel greater or happier.

00:32:34.604 --> 00:32:40.354
No position, no power was to them great.

00:32:41.684 --> 00:32:48.684
This is a complete emancipation of human beings,

00:32:49.434 --> 00:32:53.304
that you are realised soul.

00:32:54.224 --> 00:33:00.264
You should be fully equipped with compassion love and understanding.

00:33:01.184 --> 00:33:06.434
But at the same time, it should be expressed in the right way.

00:33:07.554 --> 00:33:12.264
For example, we can say Christ, He’s another example.

00:33:13.394 --> 00:33:17.184
Though He was an Incarnation, still

00:33:18.144 --> 00:33:25.514
the amount of forgiveness and love He has for people is tremendous.

00:33:26.394 --> 00:33:28.264
But at the same time,

00:33:28.434 --> 00:33:33.264
He used to go on the mountains and preach about spirituality.

00:33:35.104 --> 00:33:37.264
Those were not very safe times,

00:33:37.474 --> 00:33:41.514
because people didn’t like anybody talking like that.

00:33:42.224 --> 00:33:45.474
They hated Him because He talked about God.

00:33:46.514 --> 00:33:49.394
And what they did to Him you know very well.

00:33:50.474 --> 00:33:52.144
Doesn’t matter.

00:33:52.354 --> 00:33:55.514
Though they crucified Him, still

00:33:56.394 --> 00:34:00.604
we all respect Him as a great personality.

00:34:01.644 --> 00:34:07.144
Reason is, He was, He was no doubt an Incarnation,

00:34:08.644 --> 00:34:14.224
but still He went all out to give His achievements or

00:34:14.394 --> 00:34:17.604
I can say, whatever powers He had, to others.

00:34:18.604 --> 00:34:23.144
He went all over the places, He had no facilities,

00:34:23.394 --> 00:34:27.224
but still He went out to many people

00:34:27.354 --> 00:34:30.434
and tried to save them.

00:34:31.304 --> 00:34:33.554
This was the right-side movement.

00:34:35.144 --> 00:34:41.264
That means Sahaja Yogis can also become right-sided,but like Christ.

00:34:42.184 --> 00:34:44.264
Otherwise if they are right-sided

00:34:44.554 --> 00:34:47.434
they’ll organise, they’ll do all kinds of things,

00:34:47.514 --> 00:34:49.394
and have problems of the right side.

00:34:50.224 --> 00:34:52.554
That’s why I want you to avoid the right side.

00:34:53.264 --> 00:34:58.514
But once you are fully a left-sided master of Sahaja Yoga,

00:34:59.394 --> 00:35:03.394
then it’s very, very much needed

00:35:03.604 --> 00:35:07.144
to be a complete personality of spirituality,

00:35:07.554 --> 00:35:10.434
that you should take to right-side movement.

00:35:10.764 --> 00:35:14.514
And what is the right-side movement is the collectivity.

00:35:15.724 --> 00:35:19.144
Should not be satisfied with what you have got.

00:35:19.804 --> 00:35:21.224
It’s very easy

00:35:21.434 --> 00:35:25.184
to feel, “Oh, now we have got realisation, now what is there?

00:35:25.554 --> 00:35:29.644
We are on top of the world!” That’s not so.

00:35:30.554 --> 00:35:34.514
You have to go out, talk to people.

00:35:35.144 --> 00:35:37.304
They will insult you, they’ll trouble you,

00:35:37.514 --> 00:35:39.224
they’ll do all kinds of things.

00:35:39.434 --> 00:35:44.144
But you are already a person, already a realised soul.

00:35:44.554 --> 00:35:46.764
You can listen to them, what they are saying;

00:35:47.394 --> 00:35:54.104
you will not ask for anything, but you’d like to do good to them.

00:35:54.684 --> 00:35:56.804
This is also a compassion,

00:35:57.514 --> 00:36:00.514
that you don’t want to keep your realisation to yourself,

00:36:00.804 --> 00:36:02.724
but you want to do it

00:36:03.184 --> 00:36:06.554
for others also so that they also get realisation,

00:36:06.804 --> 00:36:11.304
it’s very important. If you do not feel that way,

00:36:11.474 --> 00:36:14.304
the pity for people who haven’t got realisation,

00:36:14.724 --> 00:36:17.764
think of the times you were not realised.

00:36:19.514 --> 00:36:24.224
These people are also not realised and they are having a bad time,

00:36:24.434 --> 00:36:26.684
they can be in for any trouble.

00:36:27.684 --> 00:36:31.104
So now, it’s not that if you have got realisation

00:36:31.264 --> 00:36:33.764
you settle down with it – no, that’s not the way;

00:36:34.554 --> 00:36:37.394
but you should go all out to see

00:36:38.144 --> 00:36:41.514
that you give realisation to others, and save them.

00:36:42.474 --> 00:36:48.434
You all have got realisation not for your sake,

00:36:48.804 --> 00:36:53.474
it’s not limited for you, but it is meant for others,

00:36:54.684 --> 00:36:56.684
that you have to give it to others.

00:36:57.684 --> 00:37:01.304
And as soon as you’ll start giving it to others you’ll be amazed,

00:37:02.104 --> 00:37:06.144
so many qualities in you will come up;

00:37:09.224 --> 00:37:14.354
because when you see others, you find

00:37:15.514 --> 00:37:17.684
that what is lacking in them,

00:37:18.474 --> 00:37:22.554
what do they need, what you have to give,  how you have to give.

00:37:23.764 --> 00:37:26.264
You can become anything, you can become a poet,

00:37:26.434 --> 00:37:30.684
you can become a writer, you can, anything can you become,

00:37:31.224 --> 00:37:33.804
in case you face others.

00:37:34.684 --> 00:37:39.144
Then it comes as a reaction within you, all these qualities develop,

00:37:39.474 --> 00:37:46.224
and you become a very good, I should say, artist.

00:37:47.604 --> 00:37:51.684
This is only possible if you meet other people

00:37:52.264 --> 00:37:55.604
and talk to them about Sahaja Yoga,

00:37:56.354 --> 00:37:58.804
and tell them about your Self-realisation.

00:37:59.804 --> 00:38:03.394
I know there will be problems, I know. That is true.

00:38:03.684 --> 00:38:06.434
There will be people who will oppose you, say

00:38:07.224 --> 00:38:09.104
all kinds of things against you,

00:38:09.304 --> 00:38:12.434
and they’ll try to stop your activities and do

00:38:12.724 --> 00:38:15.144
all kinds of harm, doesn’t matter.

00:38:16.224 --> 00:38:18.354
But that’s the thing you should achieve,

00:38:18.644 --> 00:38:21.394
is to meet people, talk to them

00:38:21.644 --> 00:38:25.184
and start telling them about Self-realisation you have to save them.

00:38:26.434 --> 00:38:27.804
That’s important.

00:38:28.224 --> 00:38:31.764
But first of all you should know that you should have no right-sided

00:38:32.304 --> 00:38:36.104
complications, otherwise they’ll all run away.

00:38:36.434 --> 00:38:39.264
A person who is spiritual is supposed

00:38:39.474 --> 00:38:42.804
or accepted to be a very humble person.

00:38:43.554 --> 00:38:47.604
Of course because he is humble, people will take advantage of him,

00:38:47.724 --> 00:38:51.304
say all kinds of things, it’s alright, is a part of the game.

00:38:51.514 --> 00:38:55.224
But, he doesn’t mind, he doesn’t mind anything.

00:38:55.514 --> 00:38:57.804
Anything that comes his way, he doesn’t mind.

00:38:58.224 --> 00:39:03.644
But what is the main thing is that he has compassion.

00:39:04.394 --> 00:39:10.604
His compassion that he had before from the left side is now expanded

00:39:11.144 --> 00:39:13.434
and he wants to save the people.

00:39:14.264 --> 00:39:18.394
People don’t have food, is alright, it’s a big complication;

00:39:18.644 --> 00:39:21.184
if people are starving is another;

00:39:21.554 --> 00:39:25.474
but if they do not get spirituality,

00:39:26.804 --> 00:39:28.724
what’s the use of their human life,

00:39:29.104 --> 00:39:31.764
why did they evolve to this state?

00:39:32.514 --> 00:39:35.104
They are evolved from animal state,

00:39:36.144 --> 00:39:40.354
from the worst possible to a human state.

00:39:40.764 --> 00:39:43.804
And now if they do not get their realisation,

00:39:44.394 --> 00:39:47.604
that means this is worse than starving,

00:39:48.264 --> 00:39:50.604
worse than all kinds of poverty,

00:39:50.804 --> 00:39:54.354
worse than all kinds of diseases and troubles.

00:39:55.224 --> 00:40:01.144
So why not try to give them realisation?

00:40:02.184 --> 00:40:05.394
Why not see that you give them realisation?

00:40:05.724 --> 00:40:08.434
But first and foremost thing, as I said,

00:40:08.644 --> 00:40:11.474
that in the left you should be very strong.

00:40:12.394 --> 00:40:15.514
You shouldn’t start doing it because you have got your realisation,

00:40:15.804 --> 00:40:17.474
you can give realisation.

00:40:17.604 --> 00:40:20.184
So you should not start doing it

00:40:21.184 --> 00:40:25.224
unless and until you have strengthened your left side.

00:40:27.224 --> 00:40:29.804
Such a person is extremely humble,

00:40:30.514 --> 00:40:34.684
extremely straight, doesn’t grudge about anything,

00:40:35.224 --> 00:40:37.304
doesn’t grumble about anything,

00:40:37.554 --> 00:40:41.224
and can adjust itself into any circumstance.

00:40:41.804 --> 00:40:44.184
It is not attached to anything.

00:40:45.264 --> 00:40:48.224
It’s an automatic detachment, it doesn’t have to detach.

00:40:48.724 --> 00:40:51.304
You may do anything for that person,

00:40:51.474 --> 00:40:55.514
you may try to get anything for that person, it’s alright.

00:40:56.724 --> 00:40:59.354
That person will accept, no doubt,

00:40:59.684 --> 00:41:02.304
but without any attachment to anything.

00:41:02.764 --> 00:41:07.804
Such a detached person is the one who can work it out,

00:41:08.514 --> 00:41:11.264
all kinds of propagation of Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:12.184 --> 00:41:14.724
Today that is the greatest need of the world,

00:41:15.434 --> 00:41:18.224
that we have to have more Sahaja Yogis.

00:41:18.554 --> 00:41:21.764
Now, people are so shy to do that,

00:41:22.514 --> 00:41:24.224
it’s very surprising.

00:41:24.394 --> 00:41:27.264
But I have seen people who don’t have any truth,

00:41:27.684 --> 00:41:30.184
who have all kinds of bad gurus,

00:41:31.224 --> 00:41:37.474
get after others, try to spread their false ideas.

00:41:37.804 --> 00:41:40.104
But Sahaja Yogis, why should they feel,

00:41:40.264 --> 00:41:43.144
why should they feel shy, I don’t understand.

00:41:43.514 --> 00:41:49.144
So, talk about this to everyone, bring them to Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:49.604 --> 00:41:54.184
Is a very important day, because as a Guru puja,

00:41:54.554 --> 00:41:59.804
they say that a guru cannot give anything to you.

00:42:01.264 --> 00:42:03.554
But I can give you the advice,

00:42:04.264 --> 00:42:07.184
and the advice that you enlarge your heart,

00:42:07.764 --> 00:42:15.644
you become humble, and try to spread Sahaja Yoga

00:42:16.474 --> 00:42:19.804
with humility, not with aggressiveness.

00:42:20.224 --> 00:42:22.514
That is extremely important.

00:42:23.604 --> 00:42:27.644
If you can do that, then you’ll do full justice

00:42:29.354 --> 00:42:32.764
to this life,  which is a spiritual life.

00:42:33.804 --> 00:42:37.354
Without that you cannot achieve, you cannot achieve,

00:42:37.724 --> 00:42:40.224
the strength of spirituality.

00:42:41.474 --> 00:42:46.474
For that you haveto understand that it’s very, very important

00:42:47.354 --> 00:42:55.304
that you should give Sahaja Yoga a full chance,through your wisdom.

00:42:56.514 --> 00:42:58.804
What I receive [is] mostly the letters are

00:42:59.304 --> 00:43:02.804
that this person is troublesome, that person is troublesome,

00:43:03.304 --> 00:43:06.474
that person is doing like that. Forget it!

00:43:07.804 --> 00:43:11.604
All such persons are not important for Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:13.354 --> 00:43:17.224
But if you start on proper lines you will be amazed,

00:43:17.514 --> 00:43:22.184
you’ll meet so many people who want peace of mind,

00:43:22.434 --> 00:43:29.434
peace of heart and a complete oneness with the Divine.

00:43:30.474 --> 00:43:32.724
They may not accept, they may not say,

00:43:33.304 --> 00:43:36.554
they might have gone to the wrong people also, possibly.

00:43:37.644 --> 00:43:39.764
But despite everything,

00:43:40.224 --> 00:43:45.764
they would like to have a real spiritual peace within themselves.

00:43:46.684 --> 00:43:50.644
Is a very common desire nowadays among people,

00:43:51.644 --> 00:43:54.554
but to approach that and to reach that,

00:43:55.224 --> 00:43:59.514
you have to take to a life of a very simple personality.

00:44:01.804 --> 00:44:06.554
You see, if you are so much interested in money,

00:44:08.144 --> 00:44:13.104
or if you are so much interested in your so-called powers

00:44:13.514 --> 00:44:19.764
or in your ambitions, then Sahaja Yoga cannot do anything.

00:44:20.514 --> 00:44:23.264
But if you are interested in your compassion

00:44:23.724 --> 00:44:27.764
and understanding about today’s world,

00:44:28.144 --> 00:44:31.474
how it is in a turmoil: why?

00:44:31.684 --> 00:44:35.604
Because of the human beings being in the wrong.

00:44:36.644 --> 00:44:42.264
What we have to do is to pass them the knowledge of the Divine.

00:44:42.604 --> 00:44:44.604
That should be your desire,

00:44:45.184 --> 00:44:49.514
and that is what you’ll feel very much comfortable with.

00:44:51.764 --> 00:44:56.104
All other desires, all other wants are,

00:44:56.724 --> 00:44:59.224
as you say, it’s very transitory.

00:45:00.604 --> 00:45:04.604
One desire is to spread Sahaja Yoga,

00:45:05.144 --> 00:45:09.264
is so beautiful that you go on working on it,

00:45:09.474 --> 00:45:12.104
and every time you do that,

00:45:12.354 --> 00:45:14.764
you will be so joyous and happy,

00:45:15.644 --> 00:45:18.144
you’ll have no problems of any kind.

00:45:18.644 --> 00:45:22.554
That’s the sign of greatness of Sahaja Yoga,

00:45:23.264 --> 00:45:26.434
and I want you all to become like that.

00:45:27.474 --> 00:45:30.554
As today’s day is great, because

00:45:30.764 --> 00:45:35.604
we are thinking of all the great saints who came on this earth

00:45:36.264 --> 00:45:38.644
and who tried to lead us.  What they did,

00:45:38.804 --> 00:45:42.804
all of them tried to spread the truth all over the world.

00:45:43.724 --> 00:45:48.224
They suffered a lot, they had problems, so many problems,

00:45:48.644 --> 00:45:55.264
but they worked very hard in every way to spread Sahaja Yoga

00:45:55.514 --> 00:45:58.604
and talk about God anddivinity.

00:45:59.434 --> 00:46:02.764
All that is what today you have to give Me,

00:46:03.304 --> 00:46:07.804
a promise, that whenever you get any other human being,

00:46:08.394 --> 00:46:10.434
you can tell them about Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:13.604 --> 00:46:18.514
Not that it’s important but it’s absolutely

00:46:19.184 --> 00:46:21.514
immediate need of the world.

00:46:22.104 --> 00:46:24.604
If you understand this point,

00:46:24.804 --> 00:46:28.764
that at this time, why are you in this world

00:46:29.394 --> 00:46:31.554
and what is the need of the world,

00:46:31.804 --> 00:46:35.394
you will immediately start feeling the responsibility.

00:46:36.264 --> 00:46:39.264
Whether you are a man or a woman is not important.

00:46:39.684 --> 00:46:43.684
Go all out to preach, think,

00:46:44.724 --> 00:46:48.264
make people understand about Sahaja  Yoga

00:46:48.644 --> 00:46:50.684
in every way that is possible,

00:46:51.394 --> 00:46:54.804
and I think, then, you will become complete as gurus.

00:46:55.684 --> 00:46:59.354
If Sahaja Yoga is just with you, you cannot be a guru.

00:46:59.804 --> 00:47:03.144
‘Guru’ also doesn’t mean that you go on preaching about Sahaja Yoga

00:47:03.304 --> 00:47:06.724
talking about Sahaja Yoga, giving lectures about Sahaja Yoga, no!

00:47:07.554 --> 00:47:11.764
It means the one who gives realisations to others.

00:47:13.804 --> 00:47:19.224
How many people you give realisation is the thing,

00:47:19.354 --> 00:47:23.764
not to be counted,  but to be felt within like the ripples,

00:47:24.724 --> 00:47:28.804
waves of the Ocean of Love in your heart.

00:47:29.644 --> 00:47:34.764
So beautiful it is to see that people get realisation

00:47:35.354 --> 00:47:39.434
and are immersed in the joy of spirituality.

00:47:40.604 --> 00:47:45.684
That’s what I want you to do. That’s why I am on this earth.

00:47:46.264 --> 00:47:49.394
I had to suffer also quite a lot, doesn’t matter:

00:47:49.554 --> 00:47:52.644
so-called sufferings, I was watching it just like a drama.

00:47:53.434 --> 00:47:54.804
So it’s ok.

00:47:56.144 --> 00:47:58.264
As long as you do not pay much attention

00:47:58.394 --> 00:48:00.724
to all these sufferings, what is so great?

00:48:01.514 --> 00:48:08.144
Now you have seen yesterday a beautiful drama about Mohammad Sahib.

00:48:08.804 --> 00:48:13.644
I always used to think,  and it was such pain, about Him,  that

00:48:13.804 --> 00:48:17.684
how people have misunderstood and have gone astray:

00:48:18.434 --> 00:48:21.224
why they are doing all wrong things? Now,

00:48:21.804 --> 00:48:26.474
I feel happy that at least you people have realised His greatness,

00:48:26.764 --> 00:48:30.514
and have understood and made such a beautiful drama out of it.

00:48:31.354 --> 00:48:34.804
I don’t know how far we can propagate this,

00:48:35.264 --> 00:48:39.514
but it’s a fact that Mohammad Sahib Himself

00:48:41.604 --> 00:48:49.554
was finished, then also His daughter, grand-children were finished,

00:48:51.264 --> 00:48:53.184
His son-in-law was finished.

00:48:54.434 --> 00:48:56.394
And after that, by finishing them,

00:48:56.554 --> 00:49:00.474
they started another horrible thing called Sunnis.

00:49:01.434 --> 00:49:06.224
Now, the Sunnah religion is not near the truth at all,

00:49:06.434 --> 00:49:12.304
it’s some sort of a very aggressive and a very cruel religion,

00:49:13.434 --> 00:49:16.264
and that started spreading everywhere.

00:49:17.264 --> 00:49:22.474
In the real Islam religion of Mohammed Sahib was not there.

00:49:23.684 --> 00:49:27.604
Those people who killed Him started becoming ‘Islamic’.

00:49:30.394 --> 00:49:33.724
So this is also a very wrong thing,

00:49:34.144 --> 00:49:39.644
that a man who was so great and so much of spirituality

00:49:40.604 --> 00:49:42.724
was not just accepted,

00:49:43.354 --> 00:49:46.554
and somebody who killed Him is now accepted.

00:49:47.514 --> 00:49:49.514
It can happen in anything.

00:49:49.804 --> 00:49:52.764
But the worst it has happened in is Islamic world,

00:49:53.264 --> 00:49:57.604
which is very dangerous, and that’s we see

00:49:57.804 --> 00:50:01.264
that, in the name of God, how many bad things they are doing.

00:50:05.224 --> 00:50:07.764
So, try to understand

00:50:08.434 --> 00:50:13.804
that it is not the fate of Mohammad Sahib it has happened,

00:50:14.724 --> 00:50:17.764
it’s not the fate of reality it has happened,

00:50:18.474 --> 00:50:21.724
but it’s an eye-opener for all of us to see

00:50:22.434 --> 00:50:29.434
that the Truth is always challenged by untruth.

00:50:30.474 --> 00:50:33.604
And we should stand by the Truth, whatever may happen.

00:50:35.144 --> 00:50:38.224
And a day will come when people will realise

00:50:38.434 --> 00:50:41.144
that this was a wrong thing they were being,

00:50:41.604 --> 00:50:43.514
all the time been following,

00:50:44.304 --> 00:50:47.724
and have been doing all kinds of nonsensical things.

00:50:48.554 --> 00:50:53.224
All this will work out I am sure, very soon,

00:50:54.764 --> 00:50:59.394
if My desire is that powerful, I’m sure

00:50:59.644 --> 00:51:04.764
that they will realise that to be kind to be nice to be compassionate

00:51:05.684 --> 00:51:11.184
is the best way to feel happy, nothing more than that.

00:51:12.184 --> 00:51:15.144
May God bless you.
