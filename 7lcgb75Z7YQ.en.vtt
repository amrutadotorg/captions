00:00.669 --> 00:07.400
Actually Christians do not know anything about
His becoming.

00:07.400 --> 00:14.850
How He became Christ or what was the need
to have Christ or a son to come down.

00:14.850 --> 00:17.300
Why not God Himself could do the job.

00:17.300 --> 00:24.840
And this is the reason why I would request
you to read for yourself the incarnation of

00:24.840 --> 00:29.630
Maha Vishnu by which you realize why Christ
was born.

00:29.630 --> 00:40.870
And it is the most important incarnation because
He is the principle.

00:40.870 --> 00:43.910
He is the principle of creation.

00:43.910 --> 00:47.489
The Tattwa as they call it in Sanskrit language.

00:47.489 --> 00:49.010
He is the tattwa.

00:49.010 --> 00:58.549
Ganesha, who resides in the Mooladhara gradually
evolves to be Christ at this stage.

00:58.549 --> 01:07.250
From that red Chakra up to this Chakra He
became the Christ.

01:07.250 --> 01:08.770
He is the principle.

01:08.770 --> 01:12.170
Now what is the principle?

01:12.170 --> 01:16.250
Within us what is our principle?

01:16.250 --> 01:21.430
Is say the Kundalini you can say?

01:21.430 --> 01:25.080
In this the electricity is the principle of
this one is.

01:25.080 --> 01:32.510
In the same way the creation, the whole creation
if you take it as such, it is the principle

01:32.510 --> 01:36.299
and the support of this creation.

01:36.299 --> 01:45.329
He represents the essence, the essence of
creation.

01:45.329 --> 01:55.969
Like we can say we have a family, husband
and wife and the child.

01:55.969 --> 02:01.969
Now the child is the essence of husband and
wife.

02:01.969 --> 02:08.039
He is the essence of the family, of the house.

02:08.039 --> 02:11.230
The whole thing is sustained for him, is created
for him.

02:11.230 --> 02:19.510
Till they did not have the child there was
no meaning to that house, no meaning to their

02:19.510 --> 02:20.510
life.

02:20.510 --> 02:23.210
But when they had a child then they had a
meaning.

02:23.210 --> 02:27.260
In the same way Christ is the essence, is
the tattwa itself.

02:27.260 --> 02:30.049
He’s the Omkara as they call it.

02:30.049 --> 02:39.200
He is the first sound, first sound that was
created AUM when the Primordial Father and

02:39.200 --> 02:43.090
Primordial Mother separated, They created
this sound.

02:43.090 --> 02:53.410
And He is that sound which is filled into
All-Pervading Power and looks after and support,

02:53.410 --> 03:05.280
actually it is more the support because looking
after is done by the father you can say or

03:05.280 --> 03:07.959
by the mother.

03:07.959 --> 03:11.860
But is the support of all the universe.

03:11.860 --> 03:15.800
And because He is just the essence, the essence
never dies.

03:15.800 --> 03:19.290
Say My essence is My Spirit, it will never
die.

03:19.290 --> 03:24.610
The body dies or the creation will die but
the essence has to be there.

03:24.610 --> 03:29.840
If the essence is lost then nothing could
be there that’s why He is the most important

03:29.840 --> 03:31.370
incarnation.

03:31.370 --> 03:35.209
Because He is the support.

03:35.209 --> 03:41.150
Now this incarnation is placed in this Agnya
Chakra of ours.

03:41.150 --> 03:46.530
Here in the center where the optic nerve or
optic thalamus cross each other like this.

03:46.530 --> 03:53.939
In the center is a very subtle point which
moves both the sides like this and like that

03:53.939 --> 04:01.650
and it creates two sounds Ham Ksham, Ham Ksham,
Ham Ksham.

04:01.650 --> 04:10.140
Ham is on the right hand side where you have
seen the superego is there and Ksham is on

04:10.140 --> 04:14.069
the left hand side where the ego is.

04:14.069 --> 04:19.730
Now these two sounds create two kinds of vibrations.

04:19.730 --> 04:32.260
The Ham sound creates the vibrations, which
make you think, “I am, I am.

04:32.260 --> 04:34.960
Ham, I am.”

04:34.960 --> 04:40.540
This comes from our existence power that we
know we have to live in this world, we’re

04:40.540 --> 04:41.630
not going to die.

04:41.630 --> 04:47.240
Any human being who tries to kill himself
is abnormal.

04:47.240 --> 04:55.430
Normally every human being, why every animal
or any living thing tries to retain its life.

04:55.430 --> 04:58.750
That is through this power of Ham that I am.

04:58.750 --> 05:04.090
Now the superego on the left hand side and
ego on the right hand side is Ksham.

05:04.090 --> 05:09.380
But now I’ll tell you about the right hand
side superego.

05:09.380 --> 05:21.040
In this superego when you are conditioned
by so many things, then you are frightened

05:21.040 --> 05:29.620
and you are worried because these experiences
make you that type of a person which has fear

05:29.620 --> 05:30.620
in the mind.

05:30.620 --> 05:34.820
And this fear is all settled in your superego.

05:34.820 --> 05:40.350
This starts from your amoeba stage you can
say and is still today is being stored there.

05:40.350 --> 05:44.030
You are afraid of police, you are afraid of
that, you are afraid of this.

05:44.030 --> 05:47.870
Some people are not afraid of these things
but are afraid of something else.

05:47.870 --> 05:54.880
Because whatever have been your conditions,
whatever have been your experiences are all

05:54.880 --> 05:57.210
put down here.

05:57.210 --> 06:00.453
Moreover when somebody reads the book of “Dracula”
now he’s afraid of the word Dracula but

06:00.453 --> 06:04.760
the children who do not read they do not know
what is a Dracula is.

06:04.760 --> 06:11.460
If you say Dracula has come they say all right
lets have a look at him.

06:11.460 --> 06:13.270
But those children have read about Dracula,
they are literally frightened and they say,

06:13.270 --> 06:16.460
“Oh God, Dracula is coming, something terrible
is going to happen.”

06:16.460 --> 06:21.400
So you see whatever you have read, whatever
you have gone through whatever experiences

06:21.400 --> 06:24.720
you have had all is in the superego.

06:24.720 --> 06:36.680
So this superego in that this center sends
message, I am, you are, you are Ham, Ham don’t

06:36.680 --> 06:41.220
be afraid, don’t be afraid, you are.

06:41.220 --> 06:46.630
So the people who come to Me, you have seen
some people who come to Me are victims of

06:46.630 --> 06:52.790
superego conditioning And these are the people,
actually at this stage only you can really

06:52.790 --> 06:54.970
discriminate between the two types.

06:54.970 --> 07:04.010
One who are very aggressive, the other who
are absolutely we should say subordinated,

07:04.010 --> 07:05.250
frightened.

07:05.250 --> 07:11.371
These people when they come to Me I have seen,
they go on crying and weeping, “Mother you

07:11.371 --> 07:16.630
know this has happened that has happened,”
and I really get tired talking to them.

07:16.630 --> 07:23.610
And there are so many of this kind that really
you have to pay attention to them as Sahaja

07:23.610 --> 07:28.690
Yogis because you’ll have to deal with them,
how to manage them and how to work it out.

07:28.690 --> 07:36.170
Now at that time if a Sahaja Yogi says, now
you go on saying Ham, Ham, Ham, Ham, a Sahaja

07:36.170 --> 07:41.350
Yogi if he says then the vibrations will drive
out his fear.

07:41.350 --> 07:46.430
Even if you are under any fear and you are
walking around and you feel that there’s

07:46.430 --> 07:49.380
frightened, you just say Ham, Ham, Ham.

07:49.380 --> 07:53.980
Now with this saying the vibrations will clear
out this side very nicely.

07:53.980 --> 08:02.100
Apart from that, that is the way you can get
help from the Divine by saying Ham.

08:02.100 --> 08:07.590
Now there are many things about Ham and Ksham
but as the time is you know, so I do not want

08:07.590 --> 08:09.320
to go into great details about it.

08:09.320 --> 08:14.560
But I would say the mantra for the right hand
side is Ham and for the left hand side is

08:14.560 --> 08:15.560
Ksham.

08:15.560 --> 08:25.460
The right hand side is the ego, which is real
problem, you understand that, is a real colossal

08:25.460 --> 08:28.090
one you have to face them, I mean.

08:28.090 --> 08:32.589
I say anything small here and there I find
the whole thing coming up onto my head like

08:32.589 --> 08:33.589
that.

08:33.589 --> 08:35.930
So what is the solution for a colossal ego?

08:35.930 --> 08:44.440
Colossal ego can only be conquered by forgiving
others.

08:44.440 --> 08:53.060
Those who have ego must learn if they feel
hurt they must say, “forgive.”

08:53.060 --> 08:56.810
Then another person hurts them, say, “forgive.”

08:56.810 --> 08:59.670
And not only forgive but ask for forgiveness.

08:59.670 --> 09:04.160
Both things should be done, more asking for
forgiveness.

09:04.160 --> 09:07.350
You have to ask for forgiveness if you have
too much of ego.

09:07.350 --> 09:08.350
It is very important.

09:08.350 --> 09:12.569
Because if you have too much of ego means
what?

09:12.569 --> 09:15.390
That you have pampered it too much.

09:15.390 --> 09:17.290
That means you have used it too much.

09:17.290 --> 09:22.399
You have dominated people and that’s why
you have such a lot of ego.

09:22.399 --> 09:28.459
If you have such a lot of ego you must all
the time try to humble down in your heart.

09:28.459 --> 09:32.750
Now in the heart resides the spirit.

09:32.750 --> 09:37.920
The ego, too much of ego in a person always
takes you away from that spirit.

09:37.920 --> 09:41.550
That’s why it is said, “Humble down in
your heart.”

09:41.550 --> 09:48.699
The reason is, in the heart resides that part
of yours which gets completely obliterated

09:48.699 --> 09:52.840
or forgotten once you start pumping up your
ego.

09:52.840 --> 10:00.600
But ego has its limits, it ends up into stupidity
and foolishness.

10:00.600 --> 10:06.410
You take any person who is egoistical and
who’s blowing his own trumpet.

10:06.410 --> 10:09.980
You will immediately know because he’ll
be stupid.

10:09.980 --> 10:16.250
Without understanding what he’s doing he’ll
be doing such stupid things that you will

10:16.250 --> 10:23.490
start wondering, especially children, “What’s
the matter with this fellow, he is quite funny?”

10:23.490 --> 10:29.980
And then the stupidity you see faces the person
then he sees for himself, “Oh God!

10:29.980 --> 10:31.560
how did I become so stupid?”

10:31.560 --> 10:38.490
The stupidity comes to you because you forget
the existence of God and your relationship

10:38.490 --> 10:41.249
with the whole.

10:41.249 --> 10:44.670
You think, “I am on my own.

10:44.670 --> 10:46.110
Why should I not do this?

10:46.110 --> 10:48.509
What is wrong in this, what is wrong in that?

10:48.509 --> 10:49.709
I should do these things.”

10:49.709 --> 10:53.389
I mean in this country the way people are
fighting for things.

10:53.389 --> 10:58.279
I mean you must, anybody I mean, those so-called
developing countries can’t understand what

10:58.279 --> 11:01.050
kind of a thing happening to these people.

11:01.050 --> 11:09.069
Because the other day My son-in-law Lav was
reading an article that people are demanding

11:09.069 --> 11:11.949
now that the son-in-law should be allowed
to marry the mother-in-law.

11:11.949 --> 11:17.790
And he just couldn’t understand how can
people gather together and ask for such an

11:17.790 --> 11:19.079
absurd thing like that.

11:19.079 --> 11:20.370
She is your mother.

11:20.370 --> 11:21.880
How can you say that way?

11:21.880 --> 11:27.920
I mean it is something an impossibility for
people, normal people to think like that.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.129
That a son-in-law can marry the mother-in-law.

11:30.129 --> 11:33.759
And what is there to make a law about it and
to talk about it.

11:33.759 --> 11:35.399
It’s a very difficult thing.

11:35.399 --> 11:40.290
All kinds of stupid things we are doing in
this country, which really makes everybody

11:40.290 --> 11:42.320
roar with laughter.

11:42.320 --> 11:47.009
Is because of our Mr. Ego companionship.

11:47.009 --> 11:51.130
It is not easy to understand how he befools
us.

11:51.130 --> 11:57.220
It goes on befooling us all the time and then
we think what’s wrong?

11:57.220 --> 12:00.750
An eighty-year-old man running after a twenty-year-old
girl.

12:00.750 --> 12:04.310
And the twenty-year-old girl befooling this
eighty-year-old man, supposed to be a statesman

12:04.310 --> 12:10.410
this, that and his statue is erected somewhere
there.

12:10.410 --> 12:14.529
How is it possible?

12:14.529 --> 12:20.000
It is only the ego makes you do all these
nonsensical and stupid things.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.490
Once you are in Sahaja Yoga you don’t know
how to control your laughter sometimes the

12:24.490 --> 12:26.019
way people are foolish.

12:26.019 --> 12:27.019
Extremely foolish.

12:27.019 --> 12:33.160
And this is what it is; it ends up in stupidity
absolute stupidity.

12:33.160 --> 12:39.410
I mean even if you want to write a novel you
won’t get such beautiful characters as you

12:39.410 --> 12:40.430
could around you, when you listen to them.

12:40.430 --> 12:46.080
And you’re shocked, Oh God what’s this
going on and very embarrassing too.

12:46.080 --> 12:56.579
Extremely embarrassing and they become so
foolish with their ego that one cannot understand

12:56.579 --> 13:04.100
how thinking man, because by thinking you
get your ego, becomes foolish.

13:04.100 --> 13:09.889
There is no wisdom in a person whose ego is
completely developed like that.

13:09.889 --> 13:12.999
If somebody has an ego like that there is
no wisdom in him.

13:12.999 --> 13:19.930
You can see that he does not know what is
wisdom.

13:19.930 --> 13:22.410
He behaves in such an immature way.

13:22.410 --> 13:27.990
He may be an elderly man, great grandfather
of somebody but as soon as he opens his mouth

13:27.990 --> 13:29.339
you are shocked at him.

13:29.339 --> 13:33.170
You think from where this joker has come?

13:33.170 --> 13:34.480
The maturity is completely lacking.

13:34.480 --> 13:40.019
The other day somebody told Me that, “Mother
how is it our parents are so stupid and we

13:40.019 --> 13:41.019
are searching God?

13:41.019 --> 13:48.339
And the elderly people are so foolish and
we are searching God?”

13:48.339 --> 13:51.720
And then I said, “No, maybe because of war
the parents are disturbed, you see”.

13:51.720 --> 13:56.040
Most of the parents were disturbed during
war and they said, “Majority of them are

13:56.040 --> 13:57.040
like this.

13:57.040 --> 14:01.579
And the younger people are searching God and
much wiser and we don’t know how to compromise

14:01.579 --> 14:03.779
with them because they are not searching God.

14:03.779 --> 14:07.860
Why is it they are not searching God and we
are searching God?

14:07.860 --> 14:11.920
And if there are some searching, they are
very few.”

14:11.920 --> 14:15.339
Now I said this may be due to war but somebody
said, “Then what about America?

14:15.339 --> 14:19.869
You see, in America the people didn’t face
war so much, the stupidity that they have

14:19.869 --> 14:21.180
is sometimes surprising.”

14:21.180 --> 14:30.269
That is the same thing as I said, is the development
of ego in a human being.

14:30.269 --> 14:35.370
Now ego is the thing that makes you think
about everything.

14:35.370 --> 14:42.290
For example, now we have to, say go from here
to Birmingham, all right.

14:42.290 --> 14:45.320
So we think now how will I go?

14:45.320 --> 14:50.749
Simple way is that I’ll take a train or
I’ll take a car and go away.

14:50.749 --> 14:54.430
If there’s no reservation needed I will
just jump into the train or going by the car.

14:54.430 --> 14:56.759
If the car is available I’ll go by car or
by train finished.

14:56.759 --> 14:58.670
What is there to think about?

14:58.670 --> 15:04.170
But no, then we must plan it out, “I’m
programmed now I have to go”.

15:04.170 --> 15:09.149
You go to the station and find the train is
not there because there was some accident

15:09.149 --> 15:11.069
so the train is not moving.

15:11.069 --> 15:15.000
So you are absolutely upset because you think
that the train has gone now what to do.

15:15.000 --> 15:21.100
In that upsetting you do not even remember
that you have a car and you have to go by

15:21.100 --> 15:22.100
the car.

15:22.100 --> 15:27.529
Now that whole things upsets you because you
had plans to go by train and you had planned

15:27.529 --> 15:31.100
everything, now you cannot reach there and
what will happen?

15:31.100 --> 15:33.589
Now you are sitting here and worrying about
it.

15:33.589 --> 15:36.910
As a person who is spontaneous what will you
do?

15:36.910 --> 15:42.100
All right depends on, I may go by train or
by car whatever I feel like at that time.

15:42.100 --> 15:43.910
He is sitting tight.

15:43.910 --> 15:47.869
So he goes to the train, sees if the train
is there.

15:47.869 --> 15:52.540
If it is, nicely there’s a space available
he gets into it.

15:52.540 --> 15:57.410
If the train is not available, all right,
he comes home takes his car and goes away.

15:57.410 --> 16:01.820
So now you have informed the people that you
must meet at such and such a place.

16:01.820 --> 16:02.820
That’s also is there you see.

16:02.820 --> 16:07.110
So those people are running up down there
and they will be there at the station.

16:07.110 --> 16:08.319
Now what’s the matter?

16:08.319 --> 16:10.720
Even if they’re at the station you can meet
them at the station.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.679
You go by train and you can meet them.

16:12.679 --> 16:16.240
What is there to be that much upset about
it?

16:16.240 --> 16:17.850
You see you can always contact them.

16:17.850 --> 16:24.709
But the way we get upset we have spoiled the
complete program of going to Birmingham, which

16:24.709 --> 16:27.230
is a very beautiful program that we have got.

16:27.230 --> 16:30.829
We have to meet new people, we have to meet
many people, we have to enjoy ourselves.

16:30.829 --> 16:35.971
That’s all finished because we had planned
something and it did not work out, we are

16:35.971 --> 16:38.410
finished.

16:38.410 --> 16:42.949
All these things make us a miserable person.

16:42.949 --> 16:48.199
And we are so miserable and so grudging and
so boring that those who are next to you just

16:48.199 --> 16:52.970
get fed up with it and they say, “Now shut
up.

16:52.970 --> 16:56.749
If you are not going to Birmingham, if you
are not going don’t go.

16:56.749 --> 17:01.100
But don’t eat my head now”, is a common
experience of many.

17:01.100 --> 17:06.610
If this Mr. Ego he’s so, he doesn’t want
you to be happy.

17:06.610 --> 17:10.660
He doesn’t want you to be relaxed.

17:10.660 --> 17:15.560
He all the time gives you ideas and tells
you, “Do this and do that and you must get

17:15.560 --> 17:16.870
it done and this is to be done.

17:16.870 --> 17:22.180
You had better inform that person, be meticulous
about it,” and it will go to such details

17:22.180 --> 17:27.330
that anything fails you are finished because
your nerves are already finished and shattered.

17:27.330 --> 17:34.740
Anything, even a drop of inconvenience comes
into you or even a feather of disturbance

17:34.740 --> 17:37.320
is there, you are finished.

17:37.320 --> 17:39.440
And so everybody is rattling, ”We have tensions.

17:39.440 --> 17:41.220
We have problems.”

17:41.220 --> 17:42.430
Why?

17:42.430 --> 17:50.620
What is the advantage of doing all these things?

17:50.620 --> 17:53.010
No advantage you know that.

17:53.010 --> 17:54.050
But then why do you do it?

17:54.050 --> 17:55.540
Because you have a big ego.

17:55.540 --> 17:57.730
It won’t allow you to rest.

17:57.730 --> 17:59.660
Whatever you may try it won’t.

17:59.660 --> 18:02.460
So what is the solution of that?

18:02.460 --> 18:05.050
Morning till evening ask for forgiveness from
God.

18:05.050 --> 18:10.100
Pull your ears from both the sides and say,
“Oh God, forgive me.

18:10.100 --> 18:11.890
Oh God, forgive me.

18:11.890 --> 18:18.160
And, oh God forgive me,” so this balloon
of ego goes down a little.

18:18.160 --> 18:20.850
Remember Him morning, evening, every time.

18:20.850 --> 18:25.280
Remembering Christ brings down your ego very
much.

18:25.280 --> 18:30.040
He did everything that was possible that you
should not develop your ego.

18:30.040 --> 18:32.010
Everything that was possible.

18:32.010 --> 18:35.820
He was born as an ordinary carpenter’s son.

18:35.820 --> 18:39.410
Lived in the most ordinary conditions.

18:39.410 --> 18:44.820
Kept Himself behind the whole scene.

18:44.820 --> 18:48.230
He could have been born as Roman Emperor.

18:48.230 --> 18:51.250
He could have been anybody there.

18:51.250 --> 18:54.040
But no He was born Himself.

18:54.040 --> 19:02.140
You know that He took his birth in a place
where even ordinary people do not take their

19:02.140 --> 19:03.140
births.

19:03.140 --> 19:05.330
But, there also the light was there.

19:05.330 --> 19:10.700
Wherever He was born there was light and joy.

19:10.700 --> 19:15.630
And this is the thing we have to know, that
we have lost the joy because we have forgotten

19:15.630 --> 19:16.800
God Almighty.

19:16.800 --> 19:26.260
When we forget Him, that He is love and He
is joy, naturally joy is also forgotten.

19:26.260 --> 19:30.400
And then we see people are not at all happy.

19:30.400 --> 19:35.450
They have affluence, they have money, they
have everything, but still they are not happy.

19:35.450 --> 19:41.070
All the time they are in such a mess that
you don’t know how to talk to them.

19:41.070 --> 19:43.060
If you say this word they’ll be angry.

19:43.060 --> 19:45.770
If you say that word they’ll be angry.

19:45.770 --> 19:49.780
They are not at all normal human beings.

19:49.780 --> 19:51.160
They are sick people.

19:51.160 --> 19:53.000
Sick with their ego.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.520
It’s a very simple thing is to ask for forgiveness.

19:56.520 --> 20:00.140
How many times do we do that?

20:00.140 --> 20:07.480
Not even once a day, not even once a month,
not even once a year.

20:07.480 --> 20:13.070
Even on a Christmas day if we could say, “Forgive
us Oh Lord for whatever we have done so far.”

20:13.070 --> 20:15.110
It will work out.

20:15.110 --> 20:19.500
But that day we must champagne to forgive
Him more.

20:19.500 --> 20:34.050
So we must have gossips and we must have all
the arrogant things by the time it is the

20:34.050 --> 20:35.050
end of Christmas.

20:35.050 --> 20:38.040
This ego, yellow side one, is the one that
presses your superego too much.

20:38.040 --> 20:39.040
It does.

20:39.040 --> 20:48.130
It presses it so much sometimes that a person
forgets that others are hurt by what they

20:48.130 --> 20:49.130
talk.

20:49.130 --> 20:56.480
On the contrary they devise methods how to
say things which are cutting, which are hurting,

20:56.480 --> 20:59.240
which are painful to others.

20:59.240 --> 21:03.200
They say such things, I mean all the time
if you see.

21:03.200 --> 21:07.540
A person say from a village if he comes and
sees he’ll think, are they quarreling, what

21:07.540 --> 21:08.540
are they doing?

21:08.540 --> 21:14.250
I mean the whole discussion, even in the parliament
I was surprised the way they talked to each

21:14.250 --> 21:20.740
other, no bull will treat another bull that
way, see.

21:20.740 --> 21:24.590
Even a dog normally does not bark at another
dog.

21:24.590 --> 21:30.130
No animal in the world all the time is barking
at its fellow man.

21:30.130 --> 21:34.160
No animal in the whole world I can tell you
this much.

21:34.160 --> 21:37.310
Only the human beings if two people are there
all the time they are going, ha ha ha ha all

21:37.310 --> 21:39.320
the time that way.

21:39.320 --> 21:40.650
How is it possible?

21:40.650 --> 21:47.650
His ego and her ego or maybe both his ego
are dashing at each other.

21:47.650 --> 21:55.630
There is a kind of a funny type of feeling
that oh I have mastered the thing, I have

21:55.630 --> 21:59.400
got the thing, I have got the point.

21:59.400 --> 22:00.740
I have proved the point.

22:00.740 --> 22:08.190
But in that I have lost everything that was
so beautiful and so much joy giving within

22:08.190 --> 22:09.190
me.

22:09.190 --> 22:15.860
Actually a sensible person would recede from
the place where two people are having an argument.

22:15.860 --> 22:18.450
Argument is a sign of tomfoolery.

22:18.450 --> 22:23.740
I haven’t seen any argument coming to any
end whatsoever.

22:23.740 --> 22:26.790
If it is then it is all right.

22:26.790 --> 22:29.020
But it never does come.

22:29.020 --> 22:33.440
Because, if say, you ask Me questions I answer
you, all right.

22:33.440 --> 22:36.900
If you do not like the answer give it up.

22:36.900 --> 22:42.150
But if you argue with Me still and I argue
with you where will you end?

22:42.150 --> 22:50.980
Argument is not going to lead you to any knowledge
but a very terrible ego developing into you.

22:50.980 --> 22:55.550
The whole modern concept is ego oriented.

22:55.550 --> 22:59.520
All western countries are ego orientated.

22:59.520 --> 23:02.500
They want to develop your ego and pamper it.

23:02.500 --> 23:06.810
There are so many other ways by which they
do.

23:06.810 --> 23:11.420
Why I’m talking more about it because we
are all supposed to be western people and

23:11.420 --> 23:12.450
affluent people you see.

23:12.450 --> 23:15.600
Supposed to be very wise and leading or misleading,
I don’t know, the developing countries.

23:15.600 --> 23:23.110
So we have to understand ourselves where are
we as far as our understanding of things are

23:23.110 --> 23:24.110
concerned.

23:24.110 --> 23:29.620
How ego is pampered within us is by a large-scale
method.

23:29.620 --> 23:33.070
They work on your ego throughout to have all
these so-called enterprises.

23:33.070 --> 23:37.770
For example to a woman they’ll say, “Oh
you must have a waist like this and you must

23:37.770 --> 23:42.650
have a face like this and you must have –“ For
a man, “You must this kind of a body.

23:42.650 --> 23:47.310
You should be Mr. Universe or you should be
something,” so the man starts working on

23:47.310 --> 23:48.310
it immediately.

23:48.310 --> 23:52.190
You must, there so many people I have seen
running on the roads in this cold, I don’t

23:52.190 --> 23:53.190
understand.

23:53.190 --> 23:55.210
Like mad you know and some of them are Member
of Parliament.

23:55.210 --> 23:59.790
The whole night they keep awake and the whole
day they are running about.

23:59.790 --> 24:02.680
I say what are you doing?

24:02.680 --> 24:04.420
What is the need to do this?

24:04.420 --> 24:05.420
To keep good health you must do it.

24:05.420 --> 24:09.260
To keep good health don’t work like mad,
be a sensible and a wise person.

24:09.260 --> 24:17.630
Wisdom is to be sought to keep good health,
to be all right and not this kind of mad ego

24:17.630 --> 24:19.090
orientated things.

24:19.090 --> 24:24.000
So then the one way is to excite your ego
about your physique.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.390
Then there is ego about, you must have a big
car.

24:27.390 --> 24:31.140
You see people try to show off their possessions.

24:31.140 --> 24:33.070
You have a big car, then they’re going about.

24:33.070 --> 24:37.020
I mean they really look to me like jokers,
that’s all they are.

24:37.020 --> 24:41.760
I mean car I can understand is a convenience
and a good quality car if somebody can afford

24:41.760 --> 24:44.390
it should have it because it is a headache
to have a bad car.

24:44.390 --> 24:45.880
So it’s all right.

24:45.880 --> 24:48.590
But by having a car you become something great.

24:48.590 --> 24:52.590
You may not have food in the house but you
must have a very good car to go about.

24:52.590 --> 24:53.760
And all these ideas come.

24:53.760 --> 24:57.990
Then they will advertise, you see, this will
be a very good car for you.

24:57.990 --> 24:59.400
What is it for you?

24:59.400 --> 25:02.240
It is nothing but to pamper your ego.

25:02.240 --> 25:06.910
All these advertisements are nothing but by
which your ego is pampered.

25:06.910 --> 25:08.910
All these things they’re treated.

25:08.910 --> 25:11.630
Now in America if you go every handle has
to be different.

25:11.630 --> 25:13.190
Everything has to be different.

25:13.190 --> 25:15.340
Why so much difference in everything?

25:15.340 --> 25:20.040
Why do you want to have everything so different?

25:20.040 --> 25:22.510
Is it some aesthetics, you think in that?

25:22.510 --> 25:26.330
It is none of the aesthetics but is just to
pamper your ego.

25:26.330 --> 25:31.080
Even the so-called art connoisseurs are nothing
but ego pamperers.

25:31.080 --> 25:34.560
Your stamp collections this, that, all this
is nothing but ego pampering.

25:34.560 --> 25:39.790
And what a waste of time, you just think about
it.

25:39.790 --> 25:48.850
This ego thing comes into us because we are
first of all, as I said, that in the west

25:48.850 --> 25:50.220
the living was very difficult.

25:50.220 --> 25:52.200
They had to fight the nature.

25:52.200 --> 25:56.360
And when you have to fight the nature you
have to develop your ego to fight it.

25:56.360 --> 26:00.570
Or actually when you are fighting the nature
the ego develops within you.

26:00.570 --> 26:06.790
And then once that momentum has started in
you it is very difficult to bring it down.

26:06.790 --> 26:13.640
It is such a terrible disease that people
have taken it for granted that that’s a

26:13.640 --> 26:14.760
part of their lives.

26:14.760 --> 26:15.990
You are not your ego.

26:15.990 --> 26:18.380
You are not.

26:18.380 --> 26:24.180
When I say that you must surrender yourself
to God they think Mother why should we surrender?

26:24.180 --> 26:27.050
Yourself means that ego with which you are
identified.

26:27.050 --> 26:31.290
I don’t say that you surrender your wisdom.

26:31.290 --> 26:37.370
Or I can say surrender your ego to your wisdom.

26:37.370 --> 26:41.780
But it is so difficult to give it up because
we have learned to live with it, identified

26:41.780 --> 26:42.780
with it.

26:42.780 --> 26:46.690
We just cannot think of life without our ego,
we just cannot.

26:46.690 --> 26:54.660
And it has gone to such an extent that we
don’t even realize how far we have gone

26:54.660 --> 26:55.720
in cruelty.

26:55.720 --> 26:59.370
Like, “I like this kind, I like that kind.”

26:59.370 --> 27:02.850
You go to somebody’s house and you say like
this.

27:02.850 --> 27:05.730
Is indecent to talk like that.

27:05.730 --> 27:10.460
It is vulgar to express, “I like.”

27:10.460 --> 27:11.950
Who are you?

27:11.950 --> 27:14.620
Are you God?

27:14.620 --> 27:15.690
I want this.

27:15.690 --> 27:17.040
I want that.

27:17.040 --> 27:19.750
I am very particular about this.

27:19.750 --> 27:22.010
I’m very, who are you?

27:22.010 --> 27:26.540
Just ask yourself a question, “Who am I?

27:26.540 --> 27:28.920
I’m the Spirit.

27:28.920 --> 27:31.370
I’m that eternal being.

27:31.370 --> 27:35.720
Have I become that?”

27:35.720 --> 27:40.340
On the contrary we are hurting everybody’s
Spirit by our ego.

27:40.340 --> 27:45.360
Every moment when we talk to others we are
hurting them.

27:45.360 --> 27:52.760
Actually people have lost faith in God, because
those who are in charge of God are so arrogant

27:52.760 --> 28:01.790
and so egoistical that it has become impossible
for anybody to think of God, which is beyond

28:01.790 --> 28:03.010
your ego.

28:03.010 --> 28:07.830
You’ll be surprised, ego is absolutely superficial
like a bubble.

28:07.830 --> 28:13.240
It is just like a balloon, which can burst
just like that.

28:13.240 --> 28:14.370
And it should go.

28:14.370 --> 28:18.770
It should go so that you should rise.

28:18.770 --> 28:25.320
It should disappear so that your attention
rises in your Spirit.

28:25.320 --> 28:31.390
And that you see the whole world as a part
of that Spirit that you are.

28:31.390 --> 28:37.080
This is the boundary, which you have to cross
and for that we have to take help from Christ.

28:37.080 --> 28:40.170
Christ crucified himself.

28:40.170 --> 28:41.710
Why?

28:41.710 --> 28:44.600
Because what did He do?

28:44.600 --> 28:46.400
Did He loot people?

28:46.400 --> 28:52.140
Today you have thousands of these thugs coming
here and looting you.

28:52.140 --> 28:53.630
Nobody crucifies them.

28:53.630 --> 28:56.490
What did He do?

28:56.490 --> 29:04.850
He just challenged the ego of these Romans
and of these Jews, those who were angry with

29:04.850 --> 29:11.330
Him, and that’s why He was crucified.

29:11.330 --> 29:15.010
And we have to crucify our ego now through
His cross.

29:15.010 --> 29:25.920
Otherwise we are going to do the same again
to ourselves that in our own being we crucify

29:25.920 --> 29:27.980
our Christ by our ego.

29:27.980 --> 29:36.400
It is a very symbolic gesture of Christ, His
birth in the most humble place, in a very

29:36.400 --> 29:37.780
humble place.

29:37.780 --> 29:43.680
He is born in the optic thalamus, you can
say, is the place where there brain, all activities

29:43.680 --> 29:52.270
coming and all the, all sorts of problems
there chasing you, and there He lives and

29:52.270 --> 30:01.000
you have to just awaken Him there so that
your ego is crucified once for all.

30:01.000 --> 30:05.610
But I don’t think you fight your ego because
it is not that important to fight.

30:05.610 --> 30:08.010
You are fighting with your shadow.

30:08.010 --> 30:14.610
You have shadow which is called as ego which
is not to be fought and wasted, waste your

30:14.610 --> 30:15.610
energy on him.

30:15.610 --> 30:21.020
Just no need to fight, only thing if you stand
in the center of the light you don’t see

30:21.020 --> 30:22.020
any shadow.

30:22.020 --> 30:23.280
It is so simple as that.

30:23.280 --> 30:29.010
If you stand in the center of light that is
Christ you don’t see any shadow anywhere.

30:29.010 --> 30:33.680
But when I say this I may sound like other
people who give sermons, “Stand in the shadow

30:33.680 --> 30:36.430
of Christ or stand in the light of Christ.”

30:36.430 --> 30:38.480
Now what does that mean?

30:38.480 --> 30:43.720
Where is that light or where is that place
where you should stand?

30:43.720 --> 30:54.500
That place is here – the center of your
optic thalamus where there is no thought.

30:54.500 --> 30:58.100
You have to stand in thoughtless awareness.

30:58.100 --> 31:01.900
Many people who have had a problem with Agnya,
many people who have come

31:01.900 --> 31:03.330
[Talk is interrupted here and a few words
are missing]

31:03.330 --> 31:07.700
…thoughts will stop and they will be beyond
thought.

31:07.700 --> 31:14.920
And this a very, very important Chakra for
Sahaja Yogis because when the Kundalini rises

31:14.920 --> 31:19.690
above, above the Agnya Chakra immediately
there is no thought.

31:19.690 --> 31:24.950
You do not get any thoughts from ego or superego.

31:24.950 --> 31:30.900
But there is wobbling in the Agnya because
of your imbalanced ways.

31:30.900 --> 31:36.810
And the imbalanced ways are, that sometimes
you are with ego or with superego.

31:36.810 --> 31:42.430
This has happened to our people in the West
because we have had so much of ego we got

31:42.430 --> 31:44.000
really tired of it.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.960
We got frightened with it.

31:45.960 --> 31:50.870
Then we started taking to drugs and things
to increase our superego.

31:50.870 --> 31:55.860
But by doing that what we are doing is pushing
by one end and bringing back another end and

31:55.860 --> 32:03.820
that’s how we are wobbling our ego and superego
by which we are not helping ourselves at all.

32:03.820 --> 32:09.650
So what one has to do is to rise within oneself
up to the point of Agnya and try to steady

32:09.650 --> 32:10.650
your Agnya.

32:10.650 --> 32:13.520
There are many people have asked Me one question.

32:13.520 --> 32:16.250
How to steady the Agnya?

32:16.250 --> 32:24.830
Agnya is placed at the crossing point of our
nerves and also optic thalamus.

32:24.830 --> 32:31.510
Now, so it is said that if you have wobbling
eyes you’ll have a wobbling Agnya.

32:31.510 --> 32:33.730
You have to steady your eyes.

32:33.730 --> 32:35.200
You have to soothe them.

32:35.200 --> 32:43.180
Now it is very, very out of date, ancient,
old and all sorts of names that you call it

32:43.180 --> 32:44.380
to a thing like that.

32:44.380 --> 32:50.170
But you must steady your eyes and steady them
in such a way that it is very soothing for

32:50.170 --> 32:51.170
the eyes.

32:51.170 --> 32:56.140
Which is the most soothing thing for the eyes
is the green grass.

32:56.140 --> 33:03.920
If you could see the green grass with your
eyes means you walk with your eyes on the

33:03.920 --> 33:04.920
ground.

33:04.920 --> 33:08.290
Your eyes will be soothed, your Agnya will
be all right.

33:08.290 --> 33:13.960
That’s why Christ said that, “I tell you
about the adulterous eyes”.

33:13.960 --> 33:15.490
He talked about adulterous eyes.

33:15.490 --> 33:19.030
The eyes with which you do adultery.

33:19.030 --> 33:22.220
Is a very common thing these days.

33:22.220 --> 33:24.280
Every woman a man must see.

33:24.280 --> 33:25.890
Every man a woman must see.

33:25.890 --> 33:28.320
As if it is the most important job.

33:28.320 --> 33:31.830
If you have not seen one woman you’re finished.

33:31.830 --> 33:33.600
I mean this is being modern.

33:33.600 --> 33:36.340
But I am an old fashioned lady.

33:36.340 --> 33:40.930
And at the time of Christ he said, “You
should not have adulterous eyes.”

33:40.930 --> 33:50.440
And the ones who have adulterous eyes are,
no more than any other, but our Western Christians.

33:50.440 --> 33:56.080
Who all the time even in the church, even
when they’re giving sermons, their eyes

33:56.080 --> 33:58.950
are moving with adultery.

33:58.950 --> 34:06.430
These eyes have to be very, very pure, very,
very deep and very loving when you want to

34:06.430 --> 34:09.020
have your Agnya all right.

34:09.020 --> 34:11.829
Because you receive through you eyes.

34:11.829 --> 34:15.240
Say if you have closed your eyes you do not
put your attention to anything because your

34:15.240 --> 34:16.240
eyes are closed.

34:16.240 --> 34:18.629
You are not adding more thoughts to yourself.

34:18.629 --> 34:22.589
But if your eyes are open you are adding much
more thoughts because everywhere the eyes

34:22.589 --> 34:27.720
go the attention goes and you see things and
create thoughts and put in them.

34:27.720 --> 34:35.929
So your attention which has to go to the Spirit,
which has to go to God, which has to shine

34:35.929 --> 34:39.179
through the window of Divine.

34:39.179 --> 34:47.850
This beautiful thing is ruined by the way
we use our eyes and we do not respect it.

34:47.850 --> 34:56.299
There’s nothing so pure and beautiful as
the grass on the ground or the ground itself,

34:56.299 --> 35:03.289
which takes our feet, which supports us, which
looks after us, enriches us.

35:03.289 --> 35:08.740
We should put our eyes on the Mother Earth
instead of looking at every person.

35:08.740 --> 35:12.931
But from Sahaja Yoga point of view now many
of you know what happens to your eyes when

35:12.931 --> 35:14.710
you look at somebody.

35:14.710 --> 35:18.329
Maybe a entity might enter your eyes.

35:18.329 --> 35:24.730
And it is, you’ll be amazed that it is the
play of the entity what we call this so-called

35:24.730 --> 35:25.730
flirting is.

35:25.730 --> 35:30.400
I’ve talked about it before also and people
didn’t like it when I told them about it.

35:30.400 --> 35:36.309
But I have seen actual entities entering from
eyes to eyes.

35:36.309 --> 35:42.089
I have seen very simple people who come down
to such places, say in a party.

35:42.089 --> 35:46.410
In a party people are just exchanging entities
from one eye to another.

35:46.410 --> 35:51.040
Once it goes to another person he puts his
entity into another person.

35:51.040 --> 35:52.040
And that third goes into another person.

35:52.040 --> 35:55.890
All the time your attention is diverted.

35:55.890 --> 35:58.329
And you feel it is attracted towards something,
you do not know why it is attracted.

35:58.329 --> 36:01.980
Now the certain symbols are also made like
that.

36:01.980 --> 36:08.579
To add up to the problems, you see all the
society is working at it.

36:08.579 --> 36:15.960
That you should appear in such a way that
every man should look at you.

36:15.960 --> 36:17.259
Every woman should look at you.

36:17.259 --> 36:18.259
Why?

36:18.259 --> 36:19.609
What is the use?

36:19.609 --> 36:23.440
Supposing I look at you what do I get?

36:23.440 --> 36:24.950
What do I get by looking at a person?

36:24.950 --> 36:28.790
What is the advantage just looking at a person?

36:28.790 --> 36:33.349
We are wasting such a lot of energy for what?

36:33.349 --> 36:41.039
In the same way if you are walking on the
roads, we are seeing some beautiful things

36:41.039 --> 36:42.039
all right.

36:42.039 --> 36:44.960
If you have to buy something, all right go
ahead, see those things, whatever you have

36:44.960 --> 36:46.690
to select is all right.

36:46.690 --> 36:51.960
But all the time just because your eyes are
such, you are just doing it and you do not

36:51.960 --> 36:59.210
know the reason why you are doing like this,
all the time why your eyes are wobbling.

36:59.210 --> 37:03.359
And that is a sure and certain sign for a
person to become mad.

37:03.359 --> 37:12.130
Absolutely, that’s a sure and certain sign
is, when a person is mad how do you make it

37:12.130 --> 37:13.780
out that a person is lunatic.

37:13.780 --> 37:20.019
If you see his eyes the iris in the eyes are
all the time wobbling.

37:20.019 --> 37:21.869
They cannot keep it steady.

37:21.869 --> 37:28.339
Or they are sick they’re also, you can see,
that these eyes are all the time wobbling.

37:28.339 --> 37:30.190
There is no steadiness.

37:30.190 --> 37:34.369
Not only this but you have seen those people
who have come in the Sahaja Yoga when they

37:34.369 --> 37:37.609
close their eyes they find their eyes are
flickering.

37:37.609 --> 37:40.869
Their eyelids are flickering.

37:40.869 --> 37:46.380
That means there is some sort of a disturbance
in the Kundalini rising.

37:46.380 --> 37:56.930
Whole tension if you call it as hundred then
at least eighty percent of it comes through

37:56.930 --> 37:58.119
our eyes.

37:58.119 --> 38:06.980
Then how important it is to protect our eyes
from all kind of useless activities we are

38:06.980 --> 38:08.080
doing.

38:08.080 --> 38:17.190
Christ - Christ’s life shows so many aspects
of how to respect others.

38:17.190 --> 38:23.500
But one of them which has been very much misused
throughout is that of the prostitute.

38:23.500 --> 38:30.539
He saved the prostitute, He saved her no doubt.

38:30.539 --> 38:33.640
But you spoil these prostitutes.

38:33.640 --> 38:38.619
A good woman you make her into prostitutes.

38:38.619 --> 38:41.730
You give her ideas by which she becomes a
prostitute.

38:41.730 --> 38:47.230
A good Huswife (old English word like housewife)
is turned into a prostitute by an egotistical

38:47.230 --> 38:48.230
man.

38:48.230 --> 38:56.770
Young small girls who are virgins are being
destroyed by your dirty glances.

38:56.770 --> 38:58.720
Do you realize this?

38:58.720 --> 39:01.869
That you are doing just the opposite what
Christ had done?

39:01.869 --> 39:06.660
And you say that He saved, Christ, so even
if we are prostitutes He’ll save us.

39:06.660 --> 39:08.619
But why be prostitutes?

39:08.619 --> 39:13.559
This is such a stupid style of thinking.

39:13.559 --> 39:19.960
That we should become prostitutes so that
Christ will save us.

39:19.960 --> 39:28.800
One has to think about all these things in
the proper light of Sahaja Yoga.

39:28.800 --> 39:34.019
Unless and until you are realized My talk
is just useless for you.

39:34.019 --> 39:39.859
But once you are realized you will know that
if you glance at someone you might suddenly

39:39.859 --> 39:41.569
get a headache at the back.

39:41.569 --> 39:46.460
You might feel a dart has gone into your head
or something has happened.

39:46.460 --> 39:52.609
You might feel that you’re blinding with
somebody’s face and you will get all kinds

39:52.609 --> 39:57.640
of experiences by which you will know how
important are your eyes.

39:57.640 --> 40:03.790
All your nervousness and everything can be
cured if you have pure eyes.

40:03.790 --> 40:08.589
But it is such a vicious circle that through
your eyes you gather all the bad and is accumulated

40:08.589 --> 40:13.920
in the Agnya and you have to clear the Agnya
to make the eyes clear.

40:13.920 --> 40:14.940
It’s a vicious circle.

40:14.940 --> 40:20.109
But it can start at a point as I said, we
have to ask for forgiveness.

40:20.109 --> 40:28.140
Secondly we have to bring Christ in our Agnya
Chakra.

40:28.140 --> 40:36.570
Thirdly we have to give up all drugs and all
intoxicants and all smoking.

40:36.570 --> 40:41.450
That happens automatically when you are a
Sahaja Yogi, it will work out.

40:41.450 --> 40:49.940
But eyes express the whole of your being,
your brain, your body, your limbs everything.

40:49.940 --> 40:58.609
And if your Agnya is all right then you eyes
are perfectly all right.

40:58.609 --> 41:01.829
They emit nothing but love wherever they glance.

41:01.829 --> 41:08.140
Only with a glance of your eyes you can raise
the Kundalini.

41:08.140 --> 41:12.109
Only with the glance of your eyes you can
cure people.

41:12.109 --> 41:19.780
Only with your glance you can bring joy into
the destroyed and the ruined people.

41:19.780 --> 41:24.470
So these eyes which you see are the windows
of your being, of your heart.

41:24.470 --> 41:32.210
When the Spirit is expressed through your
eyes, you must have noticed yourself, that

41:32.210 --> 41:38.440
when the Kundalini rises then the eyes become
dilated.

41:38.440 --> 41:46.900
And a realized soul has got black eyes because
they have these eyes are dilated.

41:46.900 --> 41:50.930
At least when I see them they are all dilated
black eyes.

41:50.930 --> 41:56.039
Apart from that a realized soul can be made
out by his eyes which are sparkling.

41:56.039 --> 41:58.190
There’s a sparkle like diamonds.

41:58.190 --> 42:03.780
They sparkle all the time and you can make
out from the eyes that this person is a realized

42:03.780 --> 42:04.780
soul.

42:04.780 --> 42:09.720
There’s a tremendous difference between
a non-realized soul’s eyes and a realized

42:09.720 --> 42:10.720
soul’s eyes.

42:10.720 --> 42:15.230
So you can imagine how your Spirit sees through
your eyes.

42:15.230 --> 42:20.349
But if the eyes are not pure it doesn’t
stay there long.

42:20.349 --> 42:25.410
So if we have to understand Christ physically
we have to respect our eyes.

42:25.410 --> 42:31.460
Mentally we have to give up all that is impure
in our mind.

42:31.460 --> 42:36.369
Now, so we come to the impurities of the mind.

42:36.369 --> 42:42.640
And the impurities of mind are, there are
so many poisons, you know, about.

42:42.640 --> 42:45.369
I mean there are books and books written about
the poison.

42:45.369 --> 42:48.730
And the psychologists are supposed to take
out all your poisons.

42:48.730 --> 42:50.780
I don’t know if they can do it at all.

42:50.780 --> 42:52.410
But they have the worst Agnya.

42:52.410 --> 42:58.670
All these psychologists have the worst Agnya
and I don’t think they are capable of really

42:58.670 --> 43:00.680
giving any relief to people who suffering
mentally.

43:00.680 --> 43:01.680
Mental sufferings are of two types.

43:01.680 --> 43:07.200
Say the same thing is that one is…

43:07.200 --> 43:17.839
MOTHER SAYS ASIDE: Vibrations are so much,
I can’t stand it.

43:17.839 --> 43:25.840
One type of mental troubles are where people
oppress you very much.

43:25.840 --> 43:30.519
You see you go on bearing the cross.

43:30.519 --> 43:35.960
Now this is a very wrong idea people have
about Christ.

43:35.960 --> 43:42.339
Bearing the cross doesn’t mean that anybody
who tries to oppress you should go on taking

43:42.339 --> 43:45.160
the enslavement upon yourself.

43:45.160 --> 43:51.619
You’re not to enslave to anyone whatsoever.

43:51.619 --> 43:57.289
Anybody who tries to make a slave out of you,
you should deny it absolutely.

43:57.289 --> 43:59.160
You should say Hum, I am.

43:59.160 --> 44:01.599
Who are you to dominate me?

44:01.599 --> 44:08.839
Anyone whether you are of a black skin, or
a red skin or a yellow skin, nobody has right

44:08.839 --> 44:11.480
to dominate anyone in this whole world.

44:11.480 --> 44:17.440
And if anybody is doing it, “Oh what to
do now, after all you see we are poor people,

44:17.440 --> 44:20.930
or we are like this or he’s supporting,”
and all that.

44:20.930 --> 44:26.230
Then they are running away from their duty
towards themselves.

44:26.230 --> 44:29.160
Such people cannot get Realization.

44:29.160 --> 44:32.640
Slaves are not going to become kings.

44:32.640 --> 44:42.680
So the slavery that is supposed to be confused
with bearing the cross is another confusion

44:42.680 --> 44:44.079
of modern times.

44:44.079 --> 44:49.430
We have to rise in our self-respect.

44:49.430 --> 44:56.470
And we have to understand that no one in this
world has a right to dominate us.

44:56.470 --> 44:59.950
But then what is bearing of the cross is?

44:59.950 --> 45:04.440
First of all the people of His level never
suffer.

45:04.440 --> 45:07.539
It’s just a joke going on.

45:07.539 --> 45:12.710
It’s a Leela, it’s a play going on for
them.

45:12.710 --> 45:21.509
They never suffer, and even if they so called
act as suffering they just do it because they

45:21.509 --> 45:23.280
want to do it.

45:23.280 --> 45:26.259
They are not helpless people.

45:26.259 --> 45:30.009
They are not slaves.

45:30.009 --> 45:36.569
And those who think that by bearing it up
and by suffering it we are becoming Christians

45:36.569 --> 45:40.450
they should know they are psychological cases.

45:40.450 --> 45:46.869
And if they are crying and weeping and all
the time saying, “What to do, you see I

45:46.869 --> 45:50.829
am in love and my lover tortures me.”

45:50.829 --> 45:54.500
You are neither in love neither you have a
lover.

45:54.500 --> 45:57.349
It is a kind of a psychological clubbing.

45:57.349 --> 46:01.700
That he is a dominating man and you like his
domination, that’s why you are together.

46:01.700 --> 46:06.290
Is a simple fact.

46:06.290 --> 46:09.280
So every human being has his own self-respect.

46:09.280 --> 46:12.359
And he must respect his self that is the Spirit
within him.

46:12.359 --> 46:15.029
And nothing should dominate it.

46:15.029 --> 46:16.589
Whether you belong to this country or that
country, or this ism or that ism.

46:16.589 --> 46:17.589
All this will break down.

46:17.589 --> 46:18.589
[The red part is not present in the tape with
FV.

46:18.589 --> 46:22.740
Also in the FV’s tape the following sentence
is a single sentence, spoken unbroken by Shri

46:22.740 --> 46:23.740
Mataji]

46:23.740 --> 46:30.950
Under the rule of God nobody has the right
to dominate anybody’s Spirit.

46:30.950 --> 46:37.130
But when you are given freedom you go to the
other side that is Mr. Ego.

46:37.130 --> 46:38.130
You do not know how to use your freedom.

46:38.130 --> 46:41.200
So you try to dominate others.

46:41.200 --> 46:46.970
Your freedom is, everybody’s freedom is
in danger.

46:46.970 --> 46:51.299
You’re on top of everyone, and torturing
everybody’s souls.

46:51.299 --> 46:59.260
And you are dominating by land and by properties
or by possessions.

46:59.260 --> 47:12.740
So either this way or that way, mentally if
you are of this category or that category,

47:12.740 --> 47:14.239
you are against yourself.

47:14.239 --> 47:19.880
Just be in the center and see for yourself.

47:19.880 --> 47:21.970
Just be looking at it.

47:21.970 --> 47:27.470
Are you emitting love towards another person?

47:27.470 --> 47:35.619
If you are a slave how can you love?

47:35.619 --> 47:36.619
You cannot.

47:36.619 --> 47:45.700
If you are free and abandoned how can you
love?

47:45.700 --> 47:50.690
Love has its own bondages very sweet and beautiful.

47:50.690 --> 47:54.200
You have to live with them.

47:54.200 --> 47:55.539
You enjoy those bondages.

47:55.539 --> 48:00.511
For a little child will come to your house
and he will spoil your house no doubt, and

48:00.511 --> 48:01.809
that he should do.

48:01.809 --> 48:06.160
And you should enjoy that spoiling.

48:06.160 --> 48:12.950
Then your freedom if it is challenged by a
little child’s crying, then you are not

48:12.950 --> 48:13.950
wise people.

48:13.950 --> 48:15.420
This is abandonment.

48:15.420 --> 48:19.930
Or I would say it is loneliness.

48:19.930 --> 48:31.380
It is cutting off from the primordial, from
the big one, from the large one that you are.

48:31.380 --> 48:35.849
Is not to be able to tolerate the freedom
of others.

48:35.849 --> 48:40.560
A child has no freedom to cry in the house.

48:40.560 --> 48:43.630
What sort of freedom you conceive of.

48:43.630 --> 48:49.559
A mother has no right to say something she
wants to say about her child, which is her

48:49.559 --> 48:52.230
duty to tell him what is right and wrong.

48:52.230 --> 48:57.999
If the son does not have right to eat whatever
he likes in his own mother’s family then

48:57.999 --> 49:00.430
what sort of freedom do you have?

49:00.430 --> 49:04.489
It’s such a confusion of things.

49:04.489 --> 49:09.220
So this kind of freedom is just the opposite
and extreme of enslavement.

49:09.220 --> 49:13.369
But in the center is love where you are bound
by everyone.

49:13.369 --> 49:16.989
I am bound by My children.

49:16.989 --> 49:18.291
Yes, I am.

49:18.291 --> 49:20.000
I am proud of them.

49:20.000 --> 49:23.910
They bound Me and I bound them too.

49:23.910 --> 49:28.160
It’s a mutual bounding which we enjoy among
ourselves.

49:28.160 --> 49:35.109
There is such a give and take when there is
such a bondage of love.

49:35.109 --> 49:41.490
But do we understand the importance of bondage
of love?

49:41.490 --> 49:43.819
At the slightest pretext we break it.

49:43.819 --> 49:46.980
Say wife says, “I would like to go out today”.

49:46.980 --> 49:48.460
The husband says “Why?

49:48.460 --> 49:51.869
I am very tired don’t you understand?“

49:51.869 --> 49:56.519
Or if the husband says, “I feel like eating
something,” or some particular thing he

49:56.519 --> 49:58.099
says pancake or something, a small thing.

49:58.099 --> 50:01.200
“Oh I am very tired every time you are demanding.”

50:01.200 --> 50:06.510
If she could just think by making that little
thing he would be so very happy.

50:06.510 --> 50:09.150
She should be dying to know what he wants.

50:09.150 --> 50:11.329
And he should be dying to do what she wants.

50:11.329 --> 50:16.609
And then enjoy each other’s company or you
are wasting all your properties that you have

50:16.609 --> 50:17.609
as human beings.

50:17.609 --> 50:21.749
You don’t know how much you are wasting
from each other.

50:21.749 --> 50:27.930
Every moment is filled with such beautiful
bondages, where exchanges are there.

50:27.930 --> 50:29.989
What have you gained?

50:29.989 --> 50:34.170
The way you are fighting.

50:34.170 --> 50:36.470
The way you are going about.

50:36.470 --> 50:38.759
What have you gained let me see?

50:38.759 --> 50:44.900
When you die you have to announce in the paper
that XYZ is dead and you find there is nobody.

50:44.900 --> 50:48.579
And you have even to pay for people to visit
you when you die.

50:48.579 --> 50:52.079
This is the case today.

50:52.079 --> 50:56.759
Such dryness, such emptiness, such loneliness
exists.

50:56.759 --> 51:01.259
What have you achieved through this.

51:01.259 --> 51:04.710
So this bondage we have to.

51:04.710 --> 51:06.891
And there is no question of sacrifice you
see, the way.

51:06.891 --> 51:07.891
We must sacrifice for the family.

51:07.891 --> 51:08.891
What are you sacrificing?

51:08.891 --> 51:16.319
I mean if you pay for your family you get
the joy out of it.

51:16.319 --> 51:20.099
That’s why you do it.

51:20.099 --> 51:26.140
If you have to lead a nice good life you are
not sacrificing anything but you are gaining

51:26.140 --> 51:28.660
by that, leading a good life.

51:28.660 --> 51:38.329
If your wife says, “Don’t go to the pub,”
and if you do not go there, then you should

51:38.329 --> 51:43.220
not say she is an orthodox, old fashioned
this that, that and that and that.

51:43.220 --> 51:47.852
But instead you should thank you stars that
in this modern times also that there is somebody

51:47.852 --> 51:51.619
who’s telling you the truth.

51:51.619 --> 51:57.099
Because the whole edifice has come up, do
you mean to say that truth should not be told?

51:57.099 --> 52:01.920
All this is falsehood in which you are living.

52:01.920 --> 52:06.230
And if you have to be happy come down to reality.

52:06.230 --> 52:11.269
Friends, also same thing.

52:11.269 --> 52:16.690
With the friends what sort of relations do
we have with our friends?

52:16.690 --> 52:18.269
What do we expect from them?

52:18.269 --> 52:25.329
Sending them a Christmas card and then if
they don’t send, feeling bad about it.

52:25.329 --> 52:29.529
There are no deeper bondages we have not lived
with them.

52:29.529 --> 52:36.470
If you allow our self to be bound by them,
they will be bound by us.

52:36.470 --> 52:38.490
You better try this.

52:38.490 --> 52:39.769
Try to be bound by them.

52:39.769 --> 52:41.670
Don’t be afraid of anybody else.

52:41.670 --> 52:47.710
Just try to be bound by others and you’ll
be amazed how much they will be giving you.

52:47.710 --> 52:53.279
I am a living example of this.

52:53.279 --> 52:55.750
I can tell you I am a living example of this.

52:55.750 --> 52:58.680
I am bound by all of you.

52:58.680 --> 53:01.339
If somebody says, “Mother when are you going
to leave us?”

53:01.339 --> 53:02.339
No I cannot.

53:02.339 --> 53:03.339
I cannot.

53:03.339 --> 53:04.930
I am just bound by you.

53:04.930 --> 53:08.339
I just do not want to leave because I love
you very much.

53:08.339 --> 53:10.589
How can I leave you?

53:10.589 --> 53:12.970
It’s impossible for Me.

53:12.970 --> 53:16.960
So then, what do I gain out of this life?

53:16.960 --> 53:18.880
Everything that is in this world.

53:18.880 --> 53:21.619
What do you want Me to get?

53:21.619 --> 53:27.499
I cannot even count what I can get out of
it.

53:27.499 --> 53:30.420
Immeasurable, ocean.

53:30.420 --> 53:32.789
I become an ocean Myself.

53:32.789 --> 53:43.880
Break your ideas about your own personal freedom
and liberation, is liberating your intelligence.

53:43.880 --> 53:48.050
You‘re liberating your own wisdom.

53:48.050 --> 54:01.849
And the sweetness and the beauty which is
never perishable whether you are old or young.

54:01.849 --> 54:04.249
That is going to be your own.

54:04.249 --> 54:11.989
But these poisons that are being built outside
and inside you, please throw them away.

54:11.989 --> 54:15.009
These are mental poisons.

54:15.009 --> 54:20.289
Through Agnya you can take them out.

54:20.289 --> 54:25.349
You see, this is an opening also through which
many things go out.

54:25.349 --> 54:28.989
Try to work it out.

54:28.989 --> 54:37.479
Look at the tree with love and you’ll find
that the tree itself is giving you the joy

54:37.479 --> 54:39.799
of its creation.

54:39.799 --> 54:41.900
Because you’ll become thoughtless.

54:41.900 --> 54:47.549
And the creator who has made that beautiful
tree will be pouring all that joy which is

54:47.549 --> 54:49.640
stored into it into you.

54:49.640 --> 54:55.030
Every human being is a store of joy.

54:55.030 --> 54:58.950
Unlimited, I assure you, believe Me.

54:58.950 --> 55:06.849
And don’t waste them because somebody is
not properly dressed, or he’s not according

55:06.849 --> 55:11.750
to the way you want him to be which you learnt
in your public school.

55:11.750 --> 55:22.719
Every doorstep, everywhere there is beauty
lying, do not miss it.

55:22.719 --> 55:29.979
But if you have possessiveness about it, an
adultery about it, then you can never enjoy

55:29.979 --> 55:33.769
them.

55:33.769 --> 55:42.900
You can never enjoy all that beauty, all that
store, all that wealth that is in every human

55:42.900 --> 55:47.390
being every moment it is bubbling.

55:47.390 --> 55:52.410
For Agnya it’s a good thing, Christmas is
coming.

55:52.410 --> 55:59.690
And at the time that when I have to wish you
Happy Christmas, that at this occasion I am

55:59.690 --> 56:07.950
speaking about Agnya Chakra in which, what
I said is, Agnya is one must know what to

56:07.950 --> 56:10.619
order and how to obey.

56:10.619 --> 56:13.099
Obey the Divine.

56:13.099 --> 56:17.390
Obey your elders.

56:17.390 --> 56:23.130
Obey your self and not your ego.

56:23.130 --> 56:25.650
And then you can order also others.

56:25.650 --> 56:33.060
Not only human beings, but you can even order
the sun and the moon and all the winds and

56:33.060 --> 56:34.200
everything in the world.

56:34.200 --> 56:39.549
Everything you can control, everything with
this Agnya.

56:39.549 --> 56:42.289
You try one thing.

56:42.289 --> 56:47.759
If you know somebody is going to do something
wrong, just take his name and put it to Agnya.

56:47.759 --> 56:50.739
He’ll not do it, try it.

56:50.739 --> 56:57.319
This is a trick I’m telling about for those
who are realized souls not for those who are

56:57.319 --> 57:00.680
not yet realized but those who are realized
can try.

57:00.680 --> 57:04.490
If the other person is doing something wrong
you can try your Agnya.

57:04.490 --> 57:10.780
Anything you order on your Agnya will be respected
but your Agnya must have Christ there.

57:10.780 --> 57:18.650
Because you have the great support awakened
within you, which does not exist here but

57:18.650 --> 57:19.670
into every man’s head.

57:19.670 --> 57:30.460
It is all pervading into all small atoms and
molecules, it is everywhere into the sun and

57:30.460 --> 57:32.390
any place you go.

57:32.390 --> 57:36.119
It is there.

57:36.119 --> 57:43.619
So try to develop your Agnya that is the mastery
of your self.

57:43.619 --> 57:51.390
Those who have a good Agnya can master anything
and understand that the idea about mastering

57:51.390 --> 57:57.130
worldly things and mastering human beings
and mastering this and some of them are mastering

57:57.130 --> 58:03.660
in, say, other crafts and things, best thing
is to master your Agnya.

58:03.660 --> 58:11.190
And you really become the master of yourself
by which you can master many things.

58:11.190 --> 58:17.680
And today on this great day when I’m wishing
you a Happy Christmas, I wish you to have

58:17.680 --> 58:26.779
the most powerful Agnya, that people when
they see your forehead should know that Christ

58:26.779 --> 58:29.670
is reborn again with in you.
