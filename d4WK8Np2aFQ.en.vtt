00:04:09.413 --> 00:04:12.610
Now if you have left Agnya,

00:04:12.635 --> 00:04:18.475
that means there’s possession us.

00:04:22.703 --> 00:04:26.878
That means all of you have got something of that kind,

00:04:27.202 --> 00:04:32.035
already you’re caught up, you’re not clean.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.755
still they have them, see down

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.584
What is the mantra for this, Gavin?

00:04:40.696 --> 00:04:43.399
For the back Agnya,

00:04:49.467 --> 00:04:55.966
Mahaganesh. Mahaganesh, Mahabhairava, correct. Now see,

00:04:57.318 --> 00:05:06.318
in the brain you’ve got all these seeds of the Gods

00:05:08.264 --> 00:05:14.201
and they are the seeds because they’re the causal of these.

00:05:14.226 --> 00:05:18.087
So the first, the causal is created

00:05:18.243 --> 00:05:23.489
and then the deities are created.

00:05:23.723 --> 00:05:31.182
So, for example, causal of the Mother Earth is fragrance, all right

00:05:31.268 --> 00:05:35.430
So from fragrance comes the Mother Earth.

00:05:35.844 --> 00:05:42.708
In the same way the causal of Brahmadeva is Hiranyagarbha,

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.663
all right?

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.706
He’s called as Hiranyagarbha.

00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:52.200
He’s the causal of Brahmadeva.

00:05:53.726 --> 00:05:58.412
Where does he stay in the brain? In the brain of the Virata

00:05:58.856 --> 00:06:05.985
whatever deities live are the causal

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.397
and in ours also, because they’re reflected.

00:06:09.422 --> 00:06:12.203
So the causal ones are here

00:06:12.237 --> 00:06:17.013
in our brain, in our brain, in our brain.

00:06:18.911 --> 00:06:21.192
At the back here,

00:06:23.826 --> 00:06:27.688
around the Agnya, is who

00:06:28.926 --> 00:06:31.582
now I give you the name,

00:06:32.755 --> 00:06:37.743
no, around the Agnya. Agnya is Mahaganesha and Mahabhairava,

00:06:38.056 --> 00:06:43.859
Agnya, at the back. And in front…

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:54.601
All right

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:02.164
At the back is actually Mahaganesha, just in the center.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.312
Just in the central point is Mahaganesha,

00:07:05.337 --> 00:07:08.306
which is the minutest point.

00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:14.731
Around him moves Mahabhairava, all right?

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:21.359
And around this, the rest of it that moves is Hiranyagarbha,

00:07:21.769 --> 00:07:24.152
all right? Now did you follow that?

00:07:25.646 --> 00:07:33.717
So when you think, or whatever thinking you do,

00:07:35.524 --> 00:07:39.675
through this superego, through this superego,

00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:45.054
you get the development of this Hiranyagarbha. Did you follow that?

00:07:47.231 --> 00:07:53.157
And also otherwise, is also, who acts when you think?

00:07:54.876 --> 00:07:58.478
Is Hiranyagarbha. Isn't it.

00:08:00.386 --> 00:08:01.864
This is Swadishthana,

00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:05.612
we call it, this is Swadishthana chakra around it, all right?

00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:09.714
So Swadishthana is divided into left and right.

00:08:11.795 --> 00:08:14.457
Left Swadishthana is Hiranyagarbha

00:08:14.482 --> 00:08:17.549
and right Swadishthana is also Hiranyagarbha,

00:08:17.897 --> 00:08:19.031
at the back here.

00:08:19.637 --> 00:08:23.388
So now to the right out first of all, at the back, if you move,

00:08:23.413 --> 00:08:25.029
is Mahaganesha.

00:08:26.831 --> 00:08:34.389
Around him moves Bhairava, who protects Mahaganesha.

00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:43.013
Around it moves, now who? Hiranyagarbha, at the back.

00:08:43.207 --> 00:08:48.441
But Hiranyagarbha has left and right side while Bhairava

00:08:49.011 --> 00:08:54.709
and Ganesha, they move on each other.

00:08:54.765 --> 00:08:57.455
Did you follow that point?

00:09:04.301 --> 00:09:09.627
Now in front, in the center here,

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:16.570
is who? Kartikeya, in the center;

00:09:16.984 --> 00:09:21.281
Christ is in the center, in the

00:09:22.018 --> 00:09:25.566
center itself where the optic chiasma is.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.394
Here outside is Kartikeya. What is Kartikeya?

00:09:31.474 --> 00:09:41.722
Kartikeya is the protector of Christ. Around Kartikeya,

00:09:41.999 --> 00:09:47.066
they’re all protectors of Christ, moves who?

00:09:47.747 --> 00:09:55.312
Now, who is Mahabhairava’s counterpart?

00:09:56.886 --> 00:10:00.825
Mahahanumana, Mahahanumana, all right?

00:10:01.808 --> 00:10:07.075
And around that, what does move? Ekadasha Rudra.

00:10:18.103 --> 00:10:21.952
The movement of Ekadasha Rudra

00:10:22.952 --> 00:10:27.617
is not circular, it is move like that.

00:10:29.053 --> 00:10:35.058
It moves like that. Or you can say, move like that.

00:10:42.874 --> 00:10:48.623
Now what is Ekadasha Rudra? Let us see.

00:10:48.965 --> 00:10:56.123
Can you give the names? Of the  Ekadasha's. Take one by one.

00:10:58.635 --> 00:11:00.264
Buddha,

00:11:01.434 --> 00:11:04.480
right? Mahavira.

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:13.160
Then Christ, then Mahabhairava.

00:11:13.396 --> 00:11:15.513
How many of them, four.

00:11:18.273 --> 00:11:23.210
Then Mahaganesha, five.

00:11:24.449 --> 00:11:26.484
You have said Bhairava?

00:11:27.099 --> 00:11:32.221
Again, again say it one by one, Buddha,

00:11:33.159 --> 00:11:42.775
Mahavira, Christ, Mahaganesha, Mahabhairava.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.320
All right, this is very clear cut for you

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.809
because just now I’ve told all of them.

00:11:52.142 --> 00:11:58.276
Buddha, Mahavira, Christ.

00:12:04.066 --> 00:12:11.294
Then, what else, four are left, four are still left.

00:12:12.998 --> 00:12:18.109
Mahahanumana, you didn’t tell? Mahahanumana, how much it is now?

00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:25.440
Three left, no four are left, four, now what are these four?

00:12:25.465 --> 00:12:30.276
Mahahanumana. Say, it’s very simple.
I just now discussed with you Mahahanumana,

00:12:31.011 --> 00:12:42.372
Mahabhairava, two, Buddha, Mahavira. Four, now, Kartikeya.

00:12:43.891 --> 00:12:46.692
Kartikeya, Ganesha, sixth.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.971
Christ, seventh. Now four more are left,

00:12:51.507 --> 00:12:53.295
now who are the four more,

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.854
let’s see, can I have it?

00:12:59.184 --> 00:13:01.762
Pat, come along.

00:13:01.981 --> 00:13:05.795
You’ve done lot of reading.

00:13:06.939 --> 00:13:11.642
Try to, I have written it down into something, eleven of these.

00:13:18.015 --> 00:13:19.855
yogini: Hiranyagarbha

00:13:21.468 --> 00:13:23.152
Brahmadeva,

00:13:23.177 --> 00:13:26.536
Hiranyagarbha, correct.

00:13:29.358 --> 00:13:32.162
Vishnu, Narayana,

00:13:33.177 --> 00:13:36.421
Lakshmi Narayana, how much it is.

00:13:38.199 --> 00:13:43.017
Shiva, Parvati, everyone.

00:13:44.229 --> 00:13:48.168
Shiva and Shakti, all right?

00:13:49.234 --> 00:13:50.636
Eleven of them.

00:13:52.972 --> 00:13:56.812
Lakshmi Narayana is one, Brahmadeva Saraswati is...

00:13:56.846 --> 00:13:58.934
Shiva Parvati, as two.

00:14:00.302 --> 00:14:06.760
All eleven are there. Why Shiva and Parvati?

00:14:07.066 --> 00:14:10.266
Two have to be taken because Shiva is the Guru,

00:14:10.694 --> 00:14:12.563
Parvati is the Shakti.

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:18.139
So if you catch on void,

00:14:18.164 --> 00:14:19.996
the beginning of the trouble starts

00:14:20.021 --> 00:14:22.485
because Shiva is the central path.

00:14:25.657 --> 00:14:28.425
There Shiva is to be taken as Guru,

00:14:29.689 --> 00:14:32.914
Shiva is Guru, Shiva is the one

00:14:33.473 --> 00:14:36.441
who is our Guru. He is our spirit.

00:14:38.183 --> 00:14:42.870
But he’s not the spirit

00:14:47.535 --> 00:14:52.677
that protects because spirit needs no protection.

00:14:54.416 --> 00:14:57.484
Whom do you protect then, also.

00:15:01.867 --> 00:15:04.522
So when you protect,

00:15:06.136 --> 00:15:09.868
you protect the spirit but what protects it

00:15:10.208 --> 00:15:16.651
is the Guru personality which is Shiva,

00:15:17.111 --> 00:15:19.721
which is Shiva actually.

00:15:20.136 --> 00:15:21.877
Did you get that?

00:15:23.551 --> 00:15:25.835
Now you might say how is Shiva is

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.950
“Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devom, Maheshwara,

00:15:29.082 --> 00:15:32.873
Guru Sakshat, Parabrahma, Tasmai Shri Guruveh Namah.”

00:15:38.043 --> 00:15:42.685
Because Guru means a person who is

00:15:44.176 --> 00:15:51.406
full of Gurutwakashan, is weight, is the gravity.

00:15:53.043 --> 00:15:58.147
Person who is with gravity, which has some sense,

00:15:59.122 --> 00:16:01.755
which is density,

00:16:02.813 --> 00:16:08.520
which is our spirit. Otherwise we have no density, we’re useless.

00:16:08.813 --> 00:16:13.539
Our spirit goes away, we float in the air as bhoots.

00:16:15.479 --> 00:16:19.819
So the Guru is everything.

00:16:23.632 --> 00:16:28.208
Today I’ve called you here to tell you how to become a Guru.

00:16:28.445 --> 00:16:33.454
So that’s why I’ve given you this introduction. Is it clear to you?

00:16:34.693 --> 00:16:39.330
All right let Me know. Now…

00:16:46.959 --> 00:16:50.409
See that? (not clear) Just laugh at yourself.

00:16:50.434 --> 00:16:53.625
With all your knowledge of how many years
I’ve been talking to you,

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:55.185
look at this, this is the point.

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:57.252
How Mother raising your kundalini just like that.

00:16:57.277 --> 00:16:58.826
Do I tell you something?

00:16:58.858 --> 00:17:01.826
You all have gone to the wrong gurus, you have done,

00:17:01.851 --> 00:17:04.501
because…nothing of the kind. Just because

00:17:05.455 --> 00:17:07.055
you’re not set here,

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:10.814
it’s the Ekadasha Rudra on your forehead,

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:14.404
If you bow before any wrong guru.

00:17:15.941 --> 00:17:18.948
With that your Ekadasha Rudra…

00:17:20.625 --> 00:17:23.217
Sahaja Yoga is very simple you know?

00:17:23.242 --> 00:17:27.845
If you put your glass upside down [UNCLEAR].

00:17:29.423 --> 00:17:34.862
if you put it like this, it is exposed to the  [UNCLEAR].

00:17:36.677 --> 00:17:38.786
Sahaja Yoga is so simple,

00:17:42.103 --> 00:17:44.469
do you follow that point?

00:17:47.061 --> 00:17:51.011
So we reach one conclusion, by mental

00:17:51.036 --> 00:17:54.879
understanding you cannot understand Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:00.461 --> 00:18:02.982
So as a guru

00:18:05.562 --> 00:18:07.838
what should you have?

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:14.054
[UNCLEAR]

00:18:14.279 --> 00:18:19.195
Yogini is asking a question...

00:18:28.976 --> 00:18:32.379
You are telling like this,

00:18:33.385 --> 00:18:42.143
if I say that, “What is the test of,

00:18:44.231 --> 00:18:50.134
say, guru?” Do you say that it should not become artificial?

00:18:51.496 --> 00:18:57.646
[UNCLEAR] Now let’s see again quite straight forward,
what is the question?

00:19:00.012 --> 00:19:02.779
No, no, what is the question?

00:19:10.031 --> 00:19:11.752
Now try to remember.

00:19:15.498 --> 00:19:18.855
What should we have?
Not at all! What  is the question.

00:19:21.296 --> 00:19:24.971
So what is the question, let's see exactly.

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:27.957
Exactly.

00:19:37.738 --> 00:19:41.405
Yogini: How do you clearing the catch from seing a false guru?

00:19:54.087 --> 00:19:59.600
This is another question, but the question I asked is:  [UNCLEAR]

00:20:00.143 --> 00:20:04.283
then what must a guru do?

00:20:06.996 --> 00:20:09.626
The thing I said, by discussion

00:20:09.651 --> 00:20:15.388
Sahaja Yoga doesn’t work out then what should we do?

00:20:18.938 --> 00:20:22.442
I asked the question what should we do?

00:20:35.361 --> 00:20:37.649
Make it simple always

00:20:37.733 --> 00:20:42.766
related to your Mother, you’ll get the answer. Hah! All right?

00:20:45.843 --> 00:20:49.068
To neutralize the old guru

00:20:49.419 --> 00:20:52.030
who has been a bad guru

00:20:54.503 --> 00:20:57.984
you have to surrender to the real guru.

00:20:58.986 --> 00:21:02.456
If your guru is the real guru

00:21:04.349 --> 00:21:09.215
then you surrender to the Mother of your real guru.

00:21:09.525 --> 00:21:13.888
Because your real guru is also surrendered to Me.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:28.970
So all gurus are to be surrendered
at the lotus feet of your Mother

00:21:35.456 --> 00:21:40.243
Then if it is Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, Shiva, Krishna,

00:21:40.323 --> 00:21:42.688
Christ, anyone of them also,

00:21:42.935 --> 00:21:46.640
Ekadasha still is more than your Mother’s Guru.

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.361
It is very difficult

00:21:52.625 --> 00:21:55.262
because we want to stick on to something,

00:21:55.514 --> 00:21:58.100
even the real guru. Christ is a real guru

00:22:02.746 --> 00:22:06.599
Christ you know of is to be also surrendered at the lotus feet

00:22:06.812 --> 00:22:10.093
of your Mother because we also know that.

00:22:11.606 --> 00:22:15.244
Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, all of them are My servants.

00:22:15.769 --> 00:22:17.889
Adi Shakti is the Mother.

00:22:18.972 --> 00:22:21.605
She’s the Mother of all the gurus,

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:27.644
of all the prophets, of all the incarnations, of all the deities.

00:22:31.383 --> 00:22:38.621
After Her, only Parabrahma is created, after that only Parabrahma.

00:22:42.923 --> 00:22:46.209
So when you have got someone like that to surrender,

00:22:46.566 --> 00:22:49.272
is the biggest  problem, is a maya.

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:55.478
That is the biggest problem because you’ve got somebody so easily.

00:22:58.046 --> 00:23:01.762
Arjuna was a great warrior till the war started,

00:23:06.093 --> 00:23:10.929
and somebody was a great swimmer when he came to the ocean.

00:23:15.902 --> 00:23:19.550
Allow your mind to do the work,

00:23:23.309 --> 00:23:24.976
allow your mind.

00:23:30.947 --> 00:23:36.438
So to be the highest guru we’ve to be completely surrendered.

00:23:42.336 --> 00:23:44.646
Now when you’re surrendered,

00:23:46.439 --> 00:23:47.844
you don’t doubt.

00:23:48.023 --> 00:23:50.682
For when this finger is completely surrendered, say,

00:23:50.782 --> 00:23:53.249
to My body, it does not doubt My body.

00:23:55.213 --> 00:23:57.013
Supposing I’m pressing and

00:23:57.601 --> 00:24:01.322
it receives the information that you’re doing that

00:24:01.802 --> 00:24:05.675
she informs the brain

00:24:07.883 --> 00:24:11.008
and informs the body that I’m doing that.

00:24:12.288 --> 00:24:16.261
It says some thing must be done to remove it, the whole body acts,

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.866
all the fingers act

00:24:18.098 --> 00:24:19.661
and all the power flows there,

00:24:19.686 --> 00:24:22.886
the energy flows there where the finger is hurt.

00:24:26.109 --> 00:24:28.070
So when you are surrendered

00:24:29.567 --> 00:24:33.070
there is no question of individualism.

00:24:35.134 --> 00:24:38.600
Those people who think of any kind of individualism

00:24:41.585 --> 00:24:44.972
are going to go out of the circulation of Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:52.482
From the beginning, I’ve told you many a time if we

00:24:53.117 --> 00:24:56.498
take out all those people who want to

00:24:58.018 --> 00:25:01.834
assert their individualism of any kind.

00:25:05.227 --> 00:25:06.891
You see,

00:25:07.348 --> 00:25:10.482
this is a branch, all right, you can see here.

00:25:11.132 --> 00:25:15.863
In the last stage, I use the same analogy better and better.

00:25:17.247 --> 00:25:19.591
Outside is the same, all right?

00:25:21.256 --> 00:25:27.320
If inside and outside is the same and the rest is [UNCLEAR].

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:33.208
If this has to become this, what has to do.

00:25:35.222 --> 00:25:40.550
This myth has to go, all right?

00:25:41.182 --> 00:25:43.626
This myth has to vanish.

00:25:45.341 --> 00:25:47.866
So this myth is based on what,

00:25:47.891 --> 00:25:49.810
our ego and superego only.

00:25:51.105 --> 00:25:53.728
Which are actually the end result

00:25:54.012 --> 00:25:56.279
of all the nonsense we have been.

00:25:56.474 --> 00:25:57.638
In a sense,

00:25:57.929 --> 00:26:04.699
all this has to go, vanish, it doesn’t exist at all,
that is the way you surrender.

00:26:06.052 --> 00:26:08.654
Indulgence

00:26:11.923 --> 00:26:15.653
You cannot be a guru unless and until at least

00:26:16.734 --> 00:26:19.345
at least you are open to it,

00:26:19.661 --> 00:26:23.395
that’s coming and going, but supposing you’re like this.

00:26:26.117 --> 00:26:27.552
Could be like the

00:26:27.577 --> 00:26:31.799
story I heard in India that there was a stupid fool,

00:26:32.771 --> 00:26:34.662
two of them.

00:26:34.897 --> 00:26:39.951
They went inside the restaurant to have something.

00:26:40.235 --> 00:26:42.343
They sat down on a table

00:26:44.102 --> 00:26:51.498
and they saw a glass put like this.

00:26:53.128 --> 00:26:57.128
They said, “What sort of a glass is this, it has no mouth.”

00:26:57.946 --> 00:27:00.286
So they called the bearer and said,

00:27:00.311 --> 00:27:05.429
“See we can’t have food unless and until
it has a mouth, take it back.”

00:27:07.465 --> 00:27:11.465
They said, “What sort of a glass is this, it has no water?”

00:27:14.531 --> 00:27:16.037
Because (not clear)

00:27:20.131 --> 00:27:26.892
But when you’re surrendered the mouth and bottom is... luckily its…

00:27:32.827 --> 00:27:36.009
That surrendering is to be achieved

00:27:36.715 --> 00:27:42.096
if you’re going to be the gurus.

00:27:50.766 --> 00:27:56.694
This is all mental, how do you open?

00:27:57.663 --> 00:27:59.726
Have a bandhan.

00:28:04.656 --> 00:28:08.589
How many times you give yourself bandhan?

00:28:22.467 --> 00:28:24.173
Before sleeping,

00:28:24.424 --> 00:28:28.259
after getting up, then namaskar to your Mother,

00:28:30.914 --> 00:28:34.111
touching My feet, very important,

00:28:34.448 --> 00:28:37.588
not to come on to the Agnya, supposed to correct.

00:28:37.613 --> 00:28:40.422
Even sitting down there I’m catching.

00:28:40.627 --> 00:28:43.254
Actually just do it now.

00:28:43.977 --> 00:28:45.881
No, again.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:51.337
Do it on both the feet, again you try.

00:28:53.621 --> 00:28:59.639
First right and then left. Ah! See now.

00:29:00.925 --> 00:29:04.459
It’s not mental, this is the point I’m bringing you.

00:29:06.466 --> 00:29:10.672
It is not mental, now this is [UNCLEAR]

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:13.573
you all become mentally alert

00:29:13.843 --> 00:29:18.303
See you must surrender to the Mother and [UNCLEAR] open your heart.

00:29:19.956 --> 00:29:24.225
So, sweetness is open your heart [UNCLEAR]

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:30.295
When others come we don’t tell them this is
how we open our heart. Don’t tell them.

00:29:37.221 --> 00:29:40.332
How you open your left Vishuddhi, just say,
“Mother I am not guilty.

00:29:40.497 --> 00:29:43.761
Mother I’m not guilty. Mother I’m not guilty.”

00:31:44.711 --> 00:31:48.770
Too much thinking, too much talking is bad.

00:31:49.938 --> 00:31:52.851
Not talking, not thinking is bad.

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:56.480
But little thinking, little talking is good.
