WEBVTT

04:09.413 --> 04:12.610
Now if you have left Agnya,

04:12.635 --> 04:18.475
that means there’s possession us.

04:22.703 --> 04:26.878
That means all of you have got something of that kind,

04:27.202 --> 04:32.035
already you’re caught up, you’re not clean.

04:32.060 --> 04:34.755
still they have them, see down

04:34.780 --> 04:39.584
What is the mantra for this, Gavin?

04:40.696 --> 04:43.399
For the back Agnya,

04:49.467 --> 04:55.966
Mahaganesh. Mahaganesh, Mahabhairava, correct. Now see,

04:57.318 --> 05:06.318
in the brain you’ve got all these seeds of the Gods

05:08.264 --> 05:14.201
and they are the seeds because they’re the causal of these.

05:14.226 --> 05:18.087
So the first, the causal is created

05:18.243 --> 05:23.489
and then the deities are created.

05:23.723 --> 05:31.182
So, for example, causal of the Mother Earth is fragrance, all right

05:31.268 --> 05:35.430
So from fragrance comes the Mother Earth.

05:35.844 --> 05:42.708
In the same way the causal of Brahmadeva is Hiranyagarbha,

05:43.210 --> 05:44.663
all right?

05:44.920 --> 05:47.706
He’s called as Hiranyagarbha.

05:47.848 --> 05:52.200
He’s the causal of Brahmadeva.

05:53.726 --> 05:58.412
Where does he stay in the brain? In the brain of the Virata

05:58.856 --> 06:05.985
whatever deities live are the causal

06:06.010 --> 06:09.397
and in ours also, because they’re reflected.

06:09.422 --> 06:12.203
So the causal ones are here

06:12.237 --> 06:17.013
in our brain, in our brain, in our brain.

06:18.911 --> 06:21.192
At the back here,

06:23.826 --> 06:27.688
around the Agnya, is who

06:28.926 --> 06:31.582
now I give you the name,

06:32.755 --> 06:37.743
no, around the Agnya. Agnya is Mahaganesha and Mahabhairava,

06:38.056 --> 06:43.859
Agnya, at the back. And in front…

06:52.245 --> 06:54.601
All right

06:56.530 --> 07:02.164
At the back is actually Mahaganesha, just in the center.

07:03.100 --> 07:05.312
Just in the central point is Mahaganesha,

07:05.337 --> 07:08.306
which is the minutest point.

07:09.339 --> 07:14.731
Around him moves Mahabhairava, all right?

07:15.110 --> 07:21.359
And around this, the rest of it that moves is Hiranyagarbha,

07:21.769 --> 07:24.152
all right? Now did you follow that?

07:25.646 --> 07:33.717
So when you think, or whatever thinking you do,

07:35.524 --> 07:39.675
through this superego, through this superego,

07:40.099 --> 07:45.054
you get the development of this Hiranyagarbha. Did you follow that?

07:47.231 --> 07:53.157
And also otherwise, is also, who acts when you think?

07:54.876 --> 07:58.478
Is Hiranyagarbha. Isn't it.

08:00.386 --> 08:01.864
This is Swadishthana,

08:01.889 --> 08:05.612
we call it, this is Swadishthana chakra around it, all right?

08:05.685 --> 08:09.714
So Swadishthana is divided into left and right.

08:11.795 --> 08:14.457
Left Swadishthana is Hiranyagarbha

08:14.482 --> 08:17.549
and right Swadishthana is also Hiranyagarbha,

08:17.897 --> 08:19.031
at the back here.

08:19.637 --> 08:23.388
So now to the right out first of all, at the back, if you move,

08:23.413 --> 08:25.029
is Mahaganesha.

08:26.831 --> 08:34.389
Around him moves Bhairava, who protects Mahaganesha.

08:37.269 --> 08:43.013
Around it moves, now who? Hiranyagarbha, at the back.

08:43.207 --> 08:48.441
But Hiranyagarbha has left and right side while Bhairava

08:49.011 --> 08:54.709
and Ganesha, they move on each other.

08:54.765 --> 08:57.455
Did you follow that point?

09:04.301 --> 09:09.627
Now in front, in the center here,

09:11.330 --> 09:16.570
is who? Kartikeya, in the center;

09:16.984 --> 09:21.281
Christ is in the center, in the

09:22.018 --> 09:25.566
center itself where the optic chiasma is.

09:26.240 --> 09:30.394
Here outside is Kartikeya. What is Kartikeya?

09:31.474 --> 09:41.722
Kartikeya is the protector of Christ. Around Kartikeya,

09:41.999 --> 09:47.066
they’re all protectors of Christ, moves who?

09:47.747 --> 09:55.312
Now, who is Mahabhairava’s counterpart?

09:56.886 --> 10:00.825
Mahahanumana, Mahahanumana, all right?

10:01.808 --> 10:07.075
And around that, what does move? Ekadasha Rudra.

10:18.103 --> 10:21.952
The movement of Ekadasha Rudra

10:22.952 --> 10:27.617
is not circular, it is move like that.

10:29.053 --> 10:35.058
It moves like that. Or you can say, move like that.

10:42.874 --> 10:48.623
Now what is Ekadasha Rudra? Let us see.

10:48.965 --> 10:56.123
Can you give the names? Of the  Ekadasha's. Take one by one.

10:58.635 --> 11:00.264
Buddha,

11:01.434 --> 11:04.480
right? Mahavira.

11:05.780 --> 11:13.160
Then Christ, then Mahabhairava.

11:13.396 --> 11:15.513
How many of them, four.

11:18.273 --> 11:23.210
Then Mahaganesha, five.

11:24.449 --> 11:26.484
You have said Bhairava?

11:27.099 --> 11:32.221
Again, again say it one by one, Buddha,

11:33.159 --> 11:42.775
Mahavira, Christ, Mahaganesha, Mahabhairava.

11:42.800 --> 11:46.320
All right, this is very clear cut for you

11:46.600 --> 11:49.809
because just now I’ve told all of them.

11:52.142 --> 11:58.276
Buddha, Mahavira, Christ.

12:04.066 --> 12:11.294
Then, what else, four are left, four are still left.

12:12.998 --> 12:18.109
Mahahanumana, you didn’t tell? Mahahanumana, how much it is now?

12:20.509 --> 12:25.440
Three left, no four are left, four, now what are these four?

12:25.465 --> 12:30.276
Mahahanumana. Say, it’s very simple.
I just now discussed with you Mahahanumana,

12:31.011 --> 12:42.372
Mahabhairava, two, Buddha, Mahavira. Four, now, Kartikeya.

12:43.891 --> 12:46.692
Kartikeya, Ganesha, sixth.

12:47.920 --> 12:50.971
Christ, seventh. Now four more are left,

12:51.507 --> 12:53.295
now who are the four more,

12:53.320 --> 12:55.854
let’s see, can I have it?

12:59.184 --> 13:01.762
Pat, come along.

13:01.981 --> 13:05.795
You’ve done lot of reading.

13:06.939 --> 13:11.642
Try to, I have written it down into something, eleven of these.

13:18.015 --> 13:19.855
yogini: Hiranyagarbha

13:21.468 --> 13:23.152
Brahmadeva,

13:23.177 --> 13:26.536
Hiranyagarbha, correct.

13:29.358 --> 13:32.162
Vishnu, Narayana,

13:33.177 --> 13:36.421
Lakshmi Narayana, how much it is.

13:38.199 --> 13:43.017
Shiva, Parvati, everyone.

13:44.229 --> 13:48.168
Shiva and Shakti, all right?

13:49.234 --> 13:50.636
Eleven of them.

13:52.972 --> 13:56.812
Lakshmi Narayana is one, Brahmadeva Saraswati is...

13:56.846 --> 13:58.934
Shiva Parvati, as two.

14:00.302 --> 14:06.760
All eleven are there. Why Shiva and Parvati?

14:07.066 --> 14:10.266
Two have to be taken because Shiva is the Guru,

14:10.694 --> 14:12.563
Parvati is the Shakti.

14:16.130 --> 14:18.139
So if you catch on void,

14:18.164 --> 14:19.996
the beginning of the trouble starts

14:20.021 --> 14:22.485
because Shiva is the central path.

14:25.657 --> 14:28.425
There Shiva is to be taken as Guru,

14:29.689 --> 14:32.914
Shiva is Guru, Shiva is the one

14:33.473 --> 14:36.441
who is our Guru. He is our spirit.

14:38.183 --> 14:42.870
But he’s not the spirit

14:47.535 --> 14:52.677
that protects because spirit needs no protection.

14:54.416 --> 14:57.484
Whom do you protect then, also.

15:01.867 --> 15:04.522
So when you protect,

15:06.136 --> 15:09.868
you protect the spirit but what protects it

15:10.208 --> 15:16.651
is the Guru personality which is Shiva,

15:17.111 --> 15:19.721
which is Shiva actually.

15:20.136 --> 15:21.877
Did you get that?

15:23.551 --> 15:25.835
Now you might say how is Shiva is

15:25.860 --> 15:28.950
“Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devom, Maheshwara,

15:29.082 --> 15:32.873
Guru Sakshat, Parabrahma, Tasmai Shri Guruveh Namah.”

15:38.043 --> 15:42.685
Because Guru means a person who is

15:44.176 --> 15:51.406
full of Gurutwakashan, is weight, is the gravity.

15:53.043 --> 15:58.147
Person who is with gravity, which has some sense,

15:59.122 --> 16:01.755
which is density,

16:02.813 --> 16:08.520
which is our spirit. Otherwise we have no density, we’re useless.

16:08.813 --> 16:13.539
Our spirit goes away, we float in the air as bhoots.

16:15.479 --> 16:19.819
So the Guru is everything.

16:23.632 --> 16:28.208
Today I’ve called you here to tell you how to become a Guru.

16:28.445 --> 16:33.454
So that’s why I’ve given you this introduction. Is it clear to you?

16:34.693 --> 16:39.330
All right let Me know. Now…

16:46.959 --> 16:50.409
See that? (not clear) Just laugh at yourself.

16:50.434 --> 16:53.625
With all your knowledge of how many years
I’ve been talking to you,

16:53.650 --> 16:55.185
look at this, this is the point.

16:55.210 --> 16:57.252
How Mother raising your kundalini just like that.

16:57.277 --> 16:58.826
Do I tell you something?

16:58.858 --> 17:01.826
You all have gone to the wrong gurus, you have done,

17:01.851 --> 17:04.501
because…nothing of the kind. Just because

17:05.455 --> 17:07.055
you’re not set here,

17:07.080 --> 17:10.814
it’s the Ekadasha Rudra on your forehead,

17:10.839 --> 17:14.404
If you bow before any wrong guru.

17:15.941 --> 17:18.948
With that your Ekadasha Rudra…

17:20.625 --> 17:23.217
Sahaja Yoga is very simple you know?

17:23.242 --> 17:27.845
If you put your glass upside down [UNCLEAR].

17:29.423 --> 17:34.862
if you put it like this, it is exposed to the  [UNCLEAR].

17:36.677 --> 17:38.786
Sahaja Yoga is so simple,

17:42.103 --> 17:44.469
do you follow that point?

17:47.061 --> 17:51.011
So we reach one conclusion, by mental

17:51.036 --> 17:54.879
understanding you cannot understand Sahaja Yoga.

18:00.461 --> 18:02.982
So as a guru

18:05.562 --> 18:07.838
what should you have?

18:10.450 --> 18:14.054
[UNCLEAR]

18:14.279 --> 18:19.195
Yogini is asking a question...

18:28.976 --> 18:32.379
You are telling like this,

18:33.385 --> 18:42.143
if I say that, “What is the test of,

18:44.231 --> 18:50.134
say, guru?” Do you say that it should not become artificial?

18:51.496 --> 18:57.646
[UNCLEAR] Now let’s see again quite straight forward,
what is the question?

19:00.012 --> 19:02.779
No, no, what is the question?

19:10.031 --> 19:11.752
Now try to remember.

19:15.498 --> 19:18.855
What should we have?
Not at all! What  is the question.

19:21.296 --> 19:24.971
So what is the question, let's see exactly.

19:26.450 --> 19:27.957
Exactly.

19:37.738 --> 19:41.405
Yogini: How do you clearing the catch from seing a false guru?

19:54.087 --> 19:59.600
This is another question, but the question I asked is:  [UNCLEAR]

20:00.143 --> 20:04.283
then what must a guru do?

20:06.996 --> 20:09.626
The thing I said, by discussion

20:09.651 --> 20:15.388
Sahaja Yoga doesn’t work out then what should we do?

20:18.938 --> 20:22.442
I asked the question what should we do?

20:35.361 --> 20:37.649
Make it simple always

20:37.733 --> 20:42.766
related to your Mother, you’ll get the answer. Hah! All right?

20:45.843 --> 20:49.068
To neutralize the old guru

20:49.419 --> 20:52.030
who has been a bad guru

20:54.503 --> 20:57.984
you have to surrender to the real guru.

20:58.986 --> 21:02.456
If your guru is the real guru

21:04.349 --> 21:09.215
then you surrender to the Mother of your real guru.

21:09.525 --> 21:13.888
Because your real guru is also surrendered to Me.

21:21.940 --> 21:28.970
So all gurus are to be surrendered
at the lotus feet of your Mother

21:35.456 --> 21:40.243
Then if it is Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, Shiva, Krishna,

21:40.323 --> 21:42.688
Christ, anyone of them also,

21:42.935 --> 21:46.640
Ekadasha still is more than your Mother’s Guru.

21:50.020 --> 21:52.361
It is very difficult

21:52.625 --> 21:55.262
because we want to stick on to something,

21:55.514 --> 21:58.100
even the real guru. Christ is a real guru

22:02.746 --> 22:06.599
Christ you know of is to be also surrendered at the lotus feet

22:06.812 --> 22:10.093
of your Mother because we also know that.

22:11.606 --> 22:15.244
Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, all of them are My servants.

22:15.769 --> 22:17.889
Adi Shakti is the Mother.

22:18.972 --> 22:21.605
She’s the Mother of all the gurus,

22:21.900 --> 22:27.644
of all the prophets, of all the incarnations, of all the deities.

22:31.383 --> 22:38.621
After Her, only Parabrahma is created, after that only Parabrahma.

22:42.923 --> 22:46.209
So when you have got someone like that to surrender,

22:46.566 --> 22:49.272
is the biggest  problem, is a maya.

22:50.590 --> 22:55.478
That is the biggest problem because you’ve got somebody so easily.

22:58.046 --> 23:01.762
Arjuna was a great warrior till the war started,

23:06.093 --> 23:10.929
and somebody was a great swimmer when he came to the ocean.

23:15.902 --> 23:19.550
Allow your mind to do the work,

23:23.309 --> 23:24.976
allow your mind.

23:30.947 --> 23:36.438
So to be the highest guru we’ve to be completely surrendered.

23:42.336 --> 23:44.646
Now when you’re surrendered,

23:46.439 --> 23:47.844
you don’t doubt.

23:48.023 --> 23:50.682
For when this finger is completely surrendered, say,

23:50.782 --> 23:53.249
to My body, it does not doubt My body.

23:55.213 --> 23:57.013
Supposing I’m pressing and

23:57.601 --> 24:01.322
it receives the information that you’re doing that

24:01.802 --> 24:05.675
she informs the brain

24:07.883 --> 24:11.008
and informs the body that I’m doing that.

24:12.288 --> 24:16.261
It says some thing must be done to remove it, the whole body acts,

24:16.300 --> 24:17.866
all the fingers act

24:18.098 --> 24:19.661
and all the power flows there,

24:19.686 --> 24:22.886
the energy flows there where the finger is hurt.

24:26.109 --> 24:28.070
So when you are surrendered

24:29.567 --> 24:33.070
there is no question of individualism.

24:35.134 --> 24:38.600
Those people who think of any kind of individualism

24:41.585 --> 24:44.972
are going to go out of the circulation of Sahaja Yoga.

24:46.700 --> 24:52.482
From the beginning, I’ve told you many a time if we

24:53.117 --> 24:56.498
take out all those people who want to

24:58.018 --> 25:01.834
assert their individualism of any kind.

25:05.227 --> 25:06.891
You see,

25:07.348 --> 25:10.482
this is a branch, all right, you can see here.

25:11.132 --> 25:15.863
In the last stage, I use the same analogy better and better.

25:17.247 --> 25:19.591
Outside is the same, all right?

25:21.256 --> 25:27.320
If inside and outside is the same and the rest is [UNCLEAR].

25:29.850 --> 25:33.208
If this has to become this, what has to do.

25:35.222 --> 25:40.550
This myth has to go, all right?

25:41.182 --> 25:43.626
This myth has to vanish.

25:45.341 --> 25:47.866
So this myth is based on what,

25:47.891 --> 25:49.810
our ego and superego only.

25:51.105 --> 25:53.728
Which are actually the end result

25:54.012 --> 25:56.279
of all the nonsense we have been.

25:56.474 --> 25:57.638
In a sense,

25:57.929 --> 26:04.699
all this has to go, vanish, it doesn’t exist at all,
that is the way you surrender.

26:06.052 --> 26:08.654
Indulgence

26:11.923 --> 26:15.653
You cannot be a guru unless and until at least

26:16.734 --> 26:19.345
at least you are open to it,

26:19.661 --> 26:23.395
that’s coming and going, but supposing you’re like this.

26:26.117 --> 26:27.552
Could be like the

26:27.577 --> 26:31.799
story I heard in India that there was a stupid fool,

26:32.771 --> 26:34.662
two of them.

26:34.897 --> 26:39.951
They went inside the restaurant to have something.

26:40.235 --> 26:42.343
They sat down on a table

26:44.102 --> 26:51.498
and they saw a glass put like this.

26:53.128 --> 26:57.128
They said, “What sort of a glass is this, it has no mouth.”

26:57.946 --> 27:00.286
So they called the bearer and said,

27:00.311 --> 27:05.429
“See we can’t have food unless and until
it has a mouth, take it back.”

27:07.465 --> 27:11.465
They said, “What sort of a glass is this, it has no water?”

27:14.531 --> 27:16.037
Because (not clear)

27:20.131 --> 27:26.892
But when you’re surrendered the mouth and bottom is... luckily its…

27:32.827 --> 27:36.009
That surrendering is to be achieved

27:36.715 --> 27:42.096
if you’re going to be the gurus.

27:50.766 --> 27:56.694
This is all mental, how do you open?

27:57.663 --> 27:59.726
Have a bandhan.

28:04.656 --> 28:08.589
How many times you give yourself bandhan?

28:22.467 --> 28:24.173
Before sleeping,

28:24.424 --> 28:28.259
after getting up, then namaskar to your Mother,

28:30.914 --> 28:34.111
touching My feet, very important,

28:34.448 --> 28:37.588
not to come on to the Agnya, supposed to correct.

28:37.613 --> 28:40.422
Even sitting down there I’m catching.

28:40.627 --> 28:43.254
Actually just do it now.

28:43.977 --> 28:45.881
No, again.

28:46.960 --> 28:51.337
Do it on both the feet, again you try.

28:53.621 --> 28:59.639
First right and then left. Ah! See now.

29:00.925 --> 29:04.459
It’s not mental, this is the point I’m bringing you.

29:06.466 --> 29:10.672
It is not mental, now this is [UNCLEAR]

29:10.990 --> 29:13.573
you all become mentally alert

29:13.843 --> 29:18.303
See you must surrender to the Mother and [UNCLEAR] open your heart.

29:19.956 --> 29:24.225
So, sweetness is open your heart [UNCLEAR]

29:25.700 --> 29:30.295
When others come we don’t tell them this is
how we open our heart. Don’t tell them.

29:37.221 --> 29:40.332
How you open your left Vishuddhi, just say,
“Mother I am not guilty.

29:40.497 --> 29:43.761
Mother I’m not guilty. Mother I’m not guilty.”

31:44.711 --> 31:48.770
Too much thinking, too much talking is bad.

31:49.938 --> 31:52.851
Not talking, not thinking is bad.

31:53.090 --> 31:56.480
But little thinking, little talking is good.
