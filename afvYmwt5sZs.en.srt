1
00:00:13,114 --> 00:00:20,290
The ancient land of India, the land once divided amongst 
waring kings and princes a land troubled over  

2
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:26,590
centuries by the occupation of foreign powers 
until in the middle of the 20th century India  

3
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:32,289
achieved independence and freedom from 
those who had ruled her for 300 years.

4
00:00:42,613 --> 00:00:46,131
Despite all their differences of language 
and religion

5
00:00:46,131 --> 00:00:50,409
Indians became united in their efforts to be rid of this foreign rule

6
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:54,732
through the courage and determination of one man Mahatma Gandhi.

7
00:00:54,732 --> 00:01:00,111
Gandhi challenged the might of the British Empire not with guns but with non-violence

8
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:07,388
with passive resistance and his unshakeable belief in a people's right to be their own masters.

9
00:01:07,388 --> 00:01:16,206
Another of India's great leaders at that time Bal Gangadhar Tilak proclaimed to a British Court on his arrest "freedom is my birthright".

10
00:01:16,664 --> 00:01:23,627
"freedom is my birthright"

11
00:01:23,627 --> 00:01:28,891
By 1942 the Indian people saw that their freedom was at last possible

12
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:32,454
and their British rulers began to fear it.

13
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,732
The slogan "quit India" was soon to be found all over the country.

14
00:01:43,732 --> 00:01:47,960
Five years later India achieved her birthright of freedom.

15
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:57,260
One of the young leaders of this campaign 
for political freedom was a medical student  

16
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:03,800
now known as Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi who has 
since that time dedicated her life to another  

17
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:10,213
kind of freedom the freedom of the Spirit through 
self-realization and the practice of Sahaja Yoga.  

18
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:14,923
It's your birthright as a human being to become 
the Spirit.

19
00:02:14,923 --> 00:02:30,810
That what Sahaja Yoga is. "Saha" means "with" and "ja" is "born". Born with you is the right to get this Yoga is the union with the Divine.

20
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:41,337
Is your birthright as a human being you are as I told you at the epitome of evolution

21
00:02:41,337 --> 00:02:49,822
and it has to work out but please open your hearts 
and open your minds.

22
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:02,990
For thousands of years India the great land of the Spirit awaited 
the fulfillment of its ancient prophecies  

23
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:09,590
that the great incarnation of the primordial 
energy the Adi Shakti would bring a yoga  

24
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:18,000
that would create an inner transformation and 
self mastery for all men

25
00:03:21,238 --> 00:03:32,121
This momentous event is also foreseen by many Indian poets including the great Rabindranath Tagore seen here with Gandhi.

26
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:40,532
The unique experience of self-realization takes place when the primordial energy called Kundalini

27
00:03:40,532 --> 00:03:47,726
is correctly awakened by someone who has already experienced and mastered their own self-realization.

28
00:03:47,726 --> 00:03:52,736
Shri Mataji has explained that the Kundalini is the power of our spiritual ascent

29
00:03:52,736 --> 00:03:59,277
found in the triangular bone at the base of the spine called sacrum by the Greeks.

30
00:03:59,277 --> 00:04:02,692
It is the power of our pure desire.

31
00:04:05,505 --> 00:04:12,517
When awakened the Kundalini rises spontaneously through six subtle centers called chakras.

32
00:04:12,517 --> 00:04:17,442
The Kundalini then emerges through the fontanel bone area at the top of the head

33
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:22,316
emitting a cool breeze that can be felt there as well as on the hands.

34
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:35,056
In her desire to offer self-realization to mankind through Sahaja Yoga Shri Mataji constantly travelled the world.

35
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:40,416
I am not here to take anything from you.

36
00:04:44,132 --> 00:04:49,940
Nor for a vote from you I am not a politician.

37
00:04:53,841 --> 00:05:00,520
I am here to give you the key of your own wealth. 

38
00:05:05,345 --> 00:05:08,713
There is big inner revolution that is coming up

39
00:05:11,423 --> 00:05:15,995
which is silent joyous

40
00:05:17,156 --> 00:05:22,317
and is going to change the whole humanity

41
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:31,226
This was the dream of Lenin

42
00:05:34,271 --> 00:05:36,197
who was a realised soul himself

43
00:05:38,648 --> 00:05:42,906
that he wanted to have a stateless state.

44
00:05:46,194 --> 00:05:51,782
And realised people don't need any state.

45
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:02,217
You are just there.

46
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:43,364
So you see, we have to understand that life has to be enjoyable

47
00:06:44,474 --> 00:06:46,439
Hello. How are you?

48
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,975
Those who have felt cool breeze in their hands

49
00:07:08,975 --> 00:07:14,419
or from their head please raise both your hands please.

50
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:22,823
So many. May God bless you.

51
00:08:17,551 --> 00:08:27,553
Shri Mataji was born in 1923 in the very center of India near the town of Nagpur in the state of Maharashtra.

52
00:08:27,553 --> 00:08:34,307
Actually I was born like this. In a very enlightened family I should say.

53
00:08:35,236 --> 00:08:39,562
My father a very enlightened man and he was

54
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:45,952
member of the Assembly, Central assembly, Member of the constitution.

55
00:08:45,952 --> 00:08:48,990
Constituent assembly Parliament.

56
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,804
My mother was a honours of mathematics

57
00:08:52,804 --> 00:08:59,520
and my father was a scholar of [unclear - languages] also.

58
00:09:00,475 --> 00:09:03,131
It was her father who took her to see Gandhi.

59
00:09:03,131 --> 00:09:05,360
When Shri Mataji he was a young girl

60
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,420
Gandhi recognized something unique in her and suggested that the child spend some time with him at the ashram

61
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:16,253
where she became a frequent visitor over the years.

62
00:09:22,601 --> 00:09:27,524
Living abroad and traveling so much allowed Shri Mataji little time at a home in India

63
00:09:27,524 --> 00:09:29,752
but the travelling did not stop.

64
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:36,701
She regularly toured this vast country reaching out to the people in the crowded cities as well as country villages.

65
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:48,441
At the end of the 90s the crowds who came to her public programs numbered in their thousands

66
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:55,570
but when Shri Mataji started teaching Sahaja Yoga in India back in 1970 it was only with a mere handful of people.

67
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:10,894
With the initial 12 people who achieved their 
self-realization

68
00:10:10,894 --> 00:10:15,140
Shri Mataji was able to establish Sahaja Yoga in India.

69
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:21,563
Then in 1973 Shri Mataji went to live in London.

70
00:10:24,453 --> 00:10:34,475
Her husband mr. now sir CP Srivastava had been elected secretary-general of the International Maritime Organization an agency of United Nations

71
00:10:34,475 --> 00:10:39,113
this brought Shri Mataji into the world of international diplomacy.

72
00:11:05,482 --> 00:11:10,160
But in the midst of her life as the wife of 
a diplomat then a mother of two children  

73
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,902
and then a grandmother Shri Mataji has 
devoted all her efforts to giving self-realization

74
00:11:15,902 --> 00:11:20,810
and bringing Sahaja Yoga to very confused societies desperate for change.

75
00:11:38,642 --> 00:11:43,880
One of the effects of Kundalini awakening through 
Sahaja Yoga has been to help people with all  

76
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:51,168
kinds of serious addictions such as drugs and 
alcohol and illnesses such as diabetes and cancer  

77
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:57,420
impressive results have attracted the attention 
of the medical profession around the world.

78
00:11:58,762 --> 00:12:05,480
Dr. David Spiro is a general practitioner in London 
who has studied the application of Sahaja Yoga  

79
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:11,450
as a form of treatment for several years and who 
has seen many cures for a variety of problems and  

80
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:17,200
a marked increase in the general good health 
and well-being of people who practice Sahaja Yoga.

81
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:23,075
I've been involved with Sahaja Yoga and the work of Shri Mataji for about the past 10 years.

82
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:33,554
In India there's been some scientific studies which have shown the physiological effects of Sahaja Yoga as a form of meditation

83
00:12:33,554 --> 00:12:42,412
and some other studies on two particular illnesses asthma and hypertension which have shown very interesting results

84
00:12:42,902 --> 00:12:54,385
they've shown for example much larger drops in blood pressure than have ever been demonstrated before by any other form of relaxation or meditation.

85
00:12:54,385 --> 00:12:58,930
People around the world have been finding that the awakening of the Kundalini

86
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:06,418
and the practice of Sahaja Yoga have 
helped to solve a wide variety of problems of all kinds.

87
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:14,640
Now at the beginning of the 21st century Sahaja Yoga is being practiced in some 70 countries.

88
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:19,023
They have all combined together integrated together so peaceful

89
00:13:19,023 --> 00:13:25,668
and they lost all these conditionings of their so-called man-made religions or

90
00:13:25,668 --> 00:13:31,830
their man-made boundaries of nations and man-made ideologist.

91
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,509
It opens out with truth to everyone.

92
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:39,641
The way there are so many political changes taking place

93
00:13:39,641 --> 00:13:43,460
so dramatically and so fast

94
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:48,000
one should expect a very beautiful world.
