WEBVTT

05:15.447 --> 05:32.078
We have arranged this Puja specially in England
so that many more can come and work out the

05:32.078 --> 05:36.568
awakening of Shri Krishna.

05:36.568 --> 05:56.378
Gita was written long time back, and it has
been translated into so many languages, and

05:56.378 --> 06:12.398
lots of commentaries and criticism has been
there.  So this bookish knowledge of Gita

06:12.398 --> 06:20.768
has ruined many people, and even today you
find there are many people who are selling

06:20.768 --> 06:29.298
the books of Gita all over and making it into
a bookish knowledge.  I don’t think Krishna

06:29.298 --> 06:37.798
ever thought that His knowledge will be sold
out like this to every Tom, Dick and Harry.

06:37.798 --> 06:45.748
As now, as you know, the Jehovah’s Witness,
they also selling Bible.  So it has become

06:45.748 --> 06:53.548
a marketing company for Shri Krishna’s Gita.

06:53.548 --> 07:05.258
There have been lots of horrible things against
the real religion of ascent, and Krishna has

07:05.258 --> 07:13.058
said, “Whenever there is the decline of
religion,” which is true today very much,

07:13.058 --> 07:26.817
“and whenever there is the saints being
tortured, I come on this earth to save the

07:26.817 --> 07:40.198
saints, and to destroy all the negative forces
and the devils,” as you call them, rakshasas.

07:40.198 --> 07:52.608
Pushtas they are called as, cruel people.
So awakening of Krishna is very important,

07:52.608 --> 08:04.597
that within us He should arise and He should
manifest His qualities within us.  Then only

08:04.597 --> 08:08.748
the forces will work out.

08:08.748 --> 08:18.937
Krishna, as a child, killed so many rakshasas.
Then He played with gopis just to open their

08:18.937 --> 08:33.707
Kundalini; He had the rasa by which to make
the energy of Shri Radha to pass through them.

08:33.707 --> 08:47.888
After killing Kamsa, the main rakshasa who
was ruling, who was actually His uncle, He

08:47.888 --> 08:54.477
killed him.  That means, your relations,
if they are devils and they are rakshasas,

08:54.477 --> 09:02.918
they have to be killed. Because he is your
relation you should not try to save him and

09:02.918 --> 09:13.598
try to bestow his evil on Sahaja Yogis or
on Sahaja Yoga.

09:13.598 --> 09:19.357
So Sahaja Yoga is the only organization in
the whole world, whether you call it spiritual

09:19.357 --> 09:27.357
or whatever you may call it, is the only organization
that it is also anxious to throw away many

09:27.357 --> 09:33.608
people from Sahaja Yoga.  There is no organization
- I mean we are not organization, also. But

09:33.608 --> 09:41.888
there is no spiritual movement, there is no
movement in the whole world that not only

09:41.888 --> 09:48.328
allows people to go out of Sahaja Yoga but
throws them out, because it is bound by the

09:48.328 --> 09:59.059
divine laws and it has to abide by the divine
laws.  Shri Krishna’s style was that: what

09:59.059 --> 10:07.938
is the need to throw them away? Just kill
them, finished.  So He killed His own uncle,

10:07.938 --> 10:15.938
making His own aunt a widow.  His own uncle
He threw away, out of the world, sent him

10:15.938 --> 10:25.928
to hell directly, finished it off. But in
Sahaja Yoga we give a chance for such people

10:25.928 --> 10:36.578
also who are very devilish types, who are
very detrimental to our growth, who are against

10:36.578 --> 10:44.838
spirituality, who are against God, we give
them a long rope to hang themselves. That’s

10:44.838 --> 10:57.368
the Mother side of this incarnation, but the
Krishna side is a very fast-moving one.

10:57.368 --> 11:10.248
Krishna did not live for very long.  In that
short time, how many rakshasas He killed!

11:10.248 --> 11:18.368
He fought on the side of Pandavas and He killed
all the Kauravas.  He didn’t kill, He said,

11:18.368 --> 11:32.908
but He did.  So the style of Krishna on one
side also is extremely sweet, extremely nice.

11:32.908 --> 11:38.378
He is like honey, that’s why He is called
Madhava, Madhu.  He is like honey on one

11:38.378 --> 11:52.488
side, only to the bees, only to the people
who want to be blessed by Him. But to the

11:52.488 --> 12:01.808
evil people, I think He’s one of the most
dangerous personalities.  Of course Shiva

12:01.808 --> 12:19.588
also does that, He has killed so many rakshasas.
And also Devi has killed many rakshasas, but

12:19.588 --> 12:29.748
She went into wars, actual wars, and She went
into discussions and arguments and things

12:29.748 --> 12:41.458
like that; but Shri Krishna, He never argued
and He knew how to get rid of them, one by

12:41.458 --> 12:49.047
one, and He played some tricks on them.
One of them I’ll tell you.

12:49.047 --> 13:02.428
There was a rakshasa who by pleasing Shiva
had got a blessing

13:02.428 --> 13:14.908
that he
is sleeping and in his sleep anybody wakes

13:14.908 --> 13:25.958
him up, such a person should be made into
ashes, bhasmasak.  Must be a good sleeper,

13:25.958 --> 13:38.947
I tell you, our neighbor, the camper, gets
some sleep like that.  And he said, “I

13:38.947 --> 13:42.398
should not be disturbed if I am sleeping.”

13:42.398 --> 13:46.298
So Shiva thought, “It’s a very simple
thing, you see. Why should anybody disturb

13:46.298 --> 13:52.778
this old Johnny? And he would be sleeping
in some cave somewhere, so it’s all right.”

13:52.778 --> 14:01.918
He didn’t think it would be quite dangerous.

14:01.918 --> 14:15.898
And he had also blessings that nobody can
conquer him, and

14:15.898 --> 14:28.518
he cannot be, he cannot be disturbed by anybody
who tries to conquer this boon on him.  So

14:28.518 --> 14:34.568
actually he was a saint, in a way, because
he was meditating and all that, but some saints

14:34.568 --> 14:40.547
become ascetic and become really, like you
should say, very right-sided.  So I would

14:40.547 --> 14:45.997
call him a rakshasa only because this kind
of people are of no use.  They just go on

14:45.997 --> 14:52.128
cursing people, saying things to them and
just finishing them off.  So then you, of

14:52.128 --> 14:57.867
course in Sahaja Yoga language there are only
two things; there are Sahaja Yogis or rakshasas,

14:57.867 --> 15:03.848
there’s nothing in between.  So we could
find he was a very right-sided, horrible,

15:03.848 --> 15:07.807
ascetic fellow who got this boon from Shiva.

15:07.807 --> 15:14.057
There was one rakshasa, actual rakshasa, I
mean that was no saintliness in him at all.

15:14.057 --> 15:22.057
This is a mixture, half-baked sort of thing.
You see, if you see the canvas of Mahabharata

15:22.057 --> 15:32.027
you will be amazed that all kinds of peoples
are described in that.  So now, this second

15:32.027 --> 15:38.797
one was a real, real rakshasa, born out of
rakshasas and was of a rakshasa quality.

15:38.797 --> 15:51.437
He, too, had another boon from Shiva that
nobody can kill him. Unless and until somebody

15:51.437 --> 16:03.997
who has got Your boon that he can kill somebody,
nobody else should kill him.

16:03.997 --> 16:09.258
Imagine poor Shiva, you see, He thought, “It’s
a very sensible thing, after all, so that

16:09.258 --> 16:15.908
he won’t cross Me.” He said, “All right.”
He’s very easily pleased, Shiva is, the

16:15.908 --> 16:20.347
problem is that.

16:20.347 --> 16:32.667
So this second one, the real one, the real
rakshasa was torturing people, and he started

16:32.667 --> 16:40.027
a big war and Shri Krishna also went in for
that war.  He was the one, that’s the only

16:40.027 --> 16:49.097
war He fought Himself and they were all fighting
there.  So Shri Krishna knew that this Shiva

16:49.097 --> 16:57.357
is not going to let this person down at any
cost, because he knows, “I am all right,”

16:57.357 --> 17:04.037
so He would not allow him to be lost.  So
what should we do?

17:04.037 --> 17:08.677
So He played a trick. He started running out

17:08.677 --> 17:17.177
of the battlefield.  Now is regarded as something
very cowardly to run out of a battlefield,

17:17.177 --> 17:23.528
you see.  I mean a person, if like that goes
to his house, his wife will refuse to have

17:23.528 --> 17:30.898
him.  It’s a very cowardly thing and it’s
very disgraceful, but what is for God, it

17:30.898 --> 17:38.008
has, it has - They have no sense of grace
or disgrace, you see.  So He ran out of the

17:38.008 --> 17:46.287
battlefield which we call, that’s why He
is called as Ranchodas, it means “the one

17:46.287 --> 17:49.828
who runs away from the battlefield.” Ranchodas.
It is His name. One of the names of Shri Krishna,

17:49.828 --> 18:00.667
is Ranchodas.  So He ran out, He ran out
and when this rakshasa discovered that Krishna

18:00.667 --> 18:06.008
has run away, he ran after Him. But Krishna
was running very fast, you see.  Rakshasa,

18:06.008 --> 18:13.047
being so bulky, could not run that fast, but
still he was running, you see.  And Krishna

18:13.047 --> 18:20.777
was seeing that he sees Him running up to
that, was keeping it.  So He went there and

18:20.777 --> 18:26.838
He entered into the cave where this another
half-baked rakshasa and half-baked yogi was

18:26.838 --> 18:37.698
sleeping.  He took out His shawl, Shri Krishna,
and put it on that yogi and He hid Himself.

18:37.698 --> 18:45.638
He covered his face – he was fast asleep
so very gently He did it.

18:45.638 --> 18:57.037
Now came the number one rakshasa, he entered
into the cave, couldn’t see Krishna anywhere

18:57.037 --> 19:03.848
but he saw this man sleeping, He saw this
is Shri Krishna,  “Oh, so now You are tired

19:03.848 --> 19:09.307
and now You are sleeping, now I’ll see how
You can survive, I’ll see to it.”  And

19:09.307 --> 19:19.128
he just went onto his throat, so this half-baked
fellow who was granted this boon, got up and

19:19.128 --> 19:27.527
he looked at him and with his third eye he
burnt him and he became ….  This is the

19:27.527 --> 19:29.448
trick.

19:29.448 --> 19:44.108
So that is how He killed so many rakshasas,
and also He told tricks to others in arguments,

19:44.108 --> 19:56.287
also He killed half-baked people, quite a
lot of them.  So I must say He was so powerful

19:56.287 --> 20:08.828
that He could work out any trick on people,
sitting down in one place. And there are so

20:08.828 --> 20:19.187
many stories about Him which I cannot tell
in one lecture, that His killing process was

20:19.187 --> 20:25.378
so smooth that nobody objected to it.

20:25.378 --> 20:30.857
There was a woman who was a devil, was sent
by Kamsa to kill Him.  And she had poison,

20:30.857 --> 20:39.357
she had put poison in her breast and she came
and she started nursing Him, and when He started

20:39.357 --> 20:48.357
sucking her (when he was a little boy of three,
four years, or maybe two years) her breast,

20:48.357 --> 20:57.097
she started becoming big, big and she died.
And then they saw that she was Putana, the

20:57.097 --> 20:58.628
one who was the devil, known.

20:58.628 --> 21:10.847
And once He knew that there are two rakshasas
who are camouflaged as two big trees.  So

21:10.847 --> 21:18.837
His mother tied Him once with - she was angry
because He was stealing her butter so she

21:18.837 --> 21:29.527
didn’t know what to tie so she tied Him
with a pounding - that we have got for rice

21:29.527 --> 21:35.837
pounding, a kind of a wooden thing, big thing.
It’s quite heavy.  So she tied Him to that.

21:35.837 --> 21:42.478
It’s such a heavy thing, I mean, you need
at least five-six people to lift it, but when

21:42.478 --> 21:48.487
she went away, Shri Krishna just walked with
it with His small, little feet, you see, and

21:48.487 --> 21:51.687
went near those trees and hit them both on
both the sides and both the trees fell down

21:51.687 --> 21:54.807
and the rakshasas died.

21:54.807 --> 22:07.587
He was so knowledgeable and so clever, because
you know that He is the brain. He is the Virata.

22:07.587 --> 22:15.568
He did it without any compassion whatsoever.
All His love, all His compassion, all everything,

22:15.568 --> 22:25.348
duty, was only meant for His gopis and gopes.
And then, when He became the king, also His

22:25.348 --> 22:34.118
life is very mysterious for people to understand,
but Sahaja yogis can understand it. But when

22:34.118 --> 22:40.978
He became the king, He had to have wives,
so He married five wives.  Imagine, more

22:40.978 --> 22:49.348
than Mohammed Sahib.  These five, why five?
Because they were five elements.  So they

22:49.348 --> 22:55.928
were the causal of the five elements so He
married five wives.  Now he had sixteen thousand

22:55.928 --> 22:58.998
powers.

22:58.998 --> 23:05.148
Now you see a man, he may be old, even about
ninety years of age, if he wants to keep some

23:05.148 --> 23:12.218
women around him, they will say he is a bad
man.  Not with a Mother, no, Mother can have

23:12.218 --> 23:16.838
as many as She likes, nobody is going to say
anything about Her character, because Mother

23:16.838 --> 23:25.118
is Mother. But a man, see, he might be absolutely
jumping into his grave, whatever it is.

23:25.118 --> 23:30.528
And there also, in India especially, if a
lady tries to help him out, to be out of the

23:30.528 --> 23:35.288
grave, they will say he had bad relations
with her.

23:35.288 --> 23:41.208
So it was such a bad situation at that time
that He didn’t want to have bad name.

23:41.208 --> 23:46.208
So He said, “What should we do about these
powers, because they’ll be women?  If they

23:46.208 --> 23:51.318
have to come on this earth, they’ll be women
and I don’t want to have bad name,” because

23:51.318 --> 23:59.518
He came for dharma.  So what He did that
these women became the princesses, and one

23:59.518 --> 24:07.858
king captured all of them.  All these sixteen
thousand women were under the capture of this

24:07.858 --> 24:18.558
man and this man was about to abuse them,
so Shri Krishna invaded that man and got hold

24:18.558 --> 24:24.898
of all these.

24:24.898 --> 24:42.158
So

24:42.158 --> 24:59.728
the

24:59.728 --> 25:06.228
sixteen thousand women which were captured
by this camp - imagine why should it be sixteen

25:06.228 --> 25:12.148
thousand?  Imagine sixteen thousand women,
it’s no easy thing to do.  This man had

25:12.148 --> 25:19.568
sixteen thousand women who succumbed to his
aggression and were there.  And then He attacked

25:19.568 --> 25:26.448
this man and captured those sixteen thousand
women and brought them and legally married

25:26.448 --> 25:30.948
them to show they were married. But what’s
the question of marriage because they were

25:30.948 --> 25:40.218
His powers?  And He used their powers, you
see. For what? For creating so many things,

25:40.218 --> 25:48.638
like if Shri Krishna had not come we would
not have known really the significance of

25:48.638 --> 25:51.658
spiritual life.

25:51.658 --> 25:58.889
He was the first who talked of spiritual life.
Rama did not talk of spiritual life, though

25:58.889 --> 26:03.378
there was an undercurrent in India.  People
knew there is spiritual life because there

26:03.378 --> 26:13.228
were saints, there were lots of what you call
the seers.  All of them were talking about

26:13.228 --> 26:21.758
it. But no incarnation talked about spiritual
life.    We had Rama Avatara, then we had

26:21.758 --> 26:26.618
Parashurama.  We had so many of these people.
Never, never they talked of spiritual life,

26:26.618 --> 26:34.738
never.  It was Shri Krishna only who first
started talking about spiritual life, and

26:34.738 --> 26:39.988
only to Arjuna He talked, because you see
what was the condition.  People were not

26:39.988 --> 26:45.308
prepared.  So those people, Sahaja Yogis,
who feel frustrated today because there are

26:45.308 --> 26:50.178
not many Sahaja Yogis or there is an obstruction,
there are certain problems, must know that

26:50.178 --> 26:57.148
at the time of Shri Krishna He could dare
speak about spirituality only to one person

26:57.148 --> 27:06.878
and that one was Arjuna.  So, I mean, we
are much better off, you see, aren’t we?

27:06.878 --> 27:14.968
Then, of course, of course after Shri Krishna,
who took the lead was Christ and He started

27:14.968 --> 27:23.448
talking about spirituality.  Even you’ll
be surprised that Abraham or Moses did not

27:23.448 --> 27:33.738
talk of spirituality.  They talked of God,
but not of spirituality. Till Christ came,

27:33.738 --> 27:39.178
nobody said that you are to be born again,
even on the other side of the world, only

27:39.178 --> 27:48.888
Shri Krishna said this thing.  Shri Rama
was taught by His guru that He should be born

27:48.888 --> 27:55.038
again, in the sense that what is the Kundalini
and all that, not that He should be born again.

27:55.038 --> 28:01.449
But He had become a human being, as I told
you. So he taught Him about Kundalini, he

28:01.449 --> 28:07.898
told Him about Kundalini but it was a very
secret science followed by only very nath

28:07.898 --> 28:15.158
pundits as we call them, as the Adi Nath and
all that.  Very few people were given Realization.

28:15.158 --> 28:21.948
In Rama’s time as we know of one, Nachiketa,
and His father-in-law was a realized soul,

28:21.948 --> 28:27.918
so compared to that, imagine how many of
us are today here who know about spirituality.

28:27.918 --> 28:34.848
Not only we feel our spirituality, we are
spiritual.  If you apply law of chance, I

28:34.848 --> 28:44.048
don’t think there could have been after
Christ even thirty people available, because

28:44.048 --> 28:51.238
if you see Christ died only two thousand years
back.  From Krishna’s time to Christ’s

28:51.238 --> 29:01.358
time it was six thousand years, and in six
thousand years Krishna had none and Christ

29:01.358 --> 29:12.258
had twelve, so now calculate only two thousand
years after that, how many could be?

29:12.258 --> 29:21.938
So we must know that it’s now in a new explosion,
that’s why I call it as “blossom time,”

29:21.938 --> 29:28.498
that we are definitely spiritual people, we
have got spirituality and that the Divine

29:28.498 --> 29:34.318
is working. So the Kali Yuga is finishing,
now it is Krita Yuga and the Krita Yuga is

29:34.318 --> 29:43.328
acting and this acting of Krita Yuga is responsible
for giving us so many Sahaja Yogis.  Krita

29:43.328 --> 29:51.398
Yuga means in the time when this all-pervading
Power has started acting.  Nobody before

29:51.398 --> 30:02.918
felt the cool vibrations, can you believe
that?  They felt the cool but not the vibrations.

30:02.918 --> 30:12.568
It was never related to any science; it was
never related to physical science specially.

30:12.568 --> 30:22.948
So I must say the achievement of Sahaja Yoga
is tremendous.   Also, thanks to this evolution

30:22.948 --> 30:38.898
in the acting of Yugas, also, that the all-pervading
Power has started acting as I am on this earth.

30:38.898 --> 30:42.248
But you could say that “Mother, why didn’t
You come earlier?”   That was not the

30:42.248 --> 30:49.098
time.  Even today you find stupid people
all around us.  I mean the percentage of

30:49.098 --> 30:56.798
sensible people seems to be quite low in the
western countries, though high up in others,

30:56.798 --> 31:01.628
but in the western countries very low, as
far as the wisdom is concerned.

31:01.628 --> 31:05.018
So we have these obstructions, these small
things going on, doesn’t matter.  Sahaja

31:05.018 --> 31:13.918
Yoga will now prosper.  It will flower and
whatever people may say, you shouldn’t worry,

31:13.918 --> 31:22.458
because once they start finding joy and happiness,
once they start finding the truth, and if

31:22.458 --> 31:27.068
they are honest, they will not leave Sahaja
Yoga. And many people know that they just

31:27.068 --> 31:31.338
don’t want to leave Sahaja Yoga.  I mean,
say there is a husband and wife, and the wife

31:31.338 --> 31:35.678
is a horrible woman, supposing, or the husband
is a horrible person and he obstructs the

31:35.678 --> 31:41.428
wife from coming to Sahaja Yoga, the husband
will say, “All right, you go ahead, I will

31:41.428 --> 31:47.368
be with Sahaja Yoga because I have now felt
the ambrosia, I have felt the beauty, the

31:47.368 --> 31:50.318
joy.”

31:50.318 --> 31:57.858
Now imagine at the time of Shri Krishna, He
talked to one person about the spirituality,

31:57.858 --> 32:07.388
only one person, Arjuna, which was heard by
Sanjaya and which he related.  It is so written

32:07.388 --> 32:16.758
by Vyasa, but He didn’t tell to everyone,
didn’t show to anyone.  He appeared in

32:16.758 --> 32:26.258
His Virata form on the battlefield but He
never showed, but now you have got photographs

32:26.258 --> 32:32.248
to see, even if you can’t see with your
eyes.  Some can see some things also, I’ve

32:32.248 --> 32:37.588
seen that some are feeling it. So you are
developing, you are growing into it.   So

32:37.588 --> 32:44.278
this is into a new realm.  It was Shri Krishna
Who started talking about it.  Of course

32:44.278 --> 32:49.018
these nath pundits did believe in all that
spirituality, but they did not talk about

32:49.018 --> 32:57.568
it, till the time, I think, of Gyaneshwara,
perhaps would be.  It was first the Gyaneshwara

32:57.568 --> 33:03.408
only who started talking about it.  Before
that it was a secret kept.  Of course after

33:03.408 --> 33:11.918
Gyaneshwara we had other people talking about
it, like we had Mohammed Sahib, we had Nanaka,

33:11.918 --> 33:19.868
we had so many other people like Shirdi Sai
Nath and some Sufi people and they started

33:19.868 --> 33:25.018
talking on spirituality.

33:25.018 --> 33:34.838
So we have to be historically very much thankful
to Krishna because He is the One who has broken

33:34.838 --> 33:39.638
the first knot and that’s why it’s called
as Vishnu Granthi and the Vishnu Granthi to

33:39.638 --> 33:50.528
knowledge has been first opened by Shri Krishna
and He wanted that gradually it should work,

33:50.528 --> 34:02.588
gradually.  So His Gita is not so clear cut,
but is diplomatically written.  So now we

34:02.588 --> 34:10.058
can find that the only person who first tried
his hand on Gita was Gyanadeva and Gyanadeva,

34:10.058 --> 34:15.458
when he wrote on the sixth chapter, everything
about Kundalini, they just said, “This is

34:15.458 --> 34:24.419
banned, you are not to read this one,” because
they could not deliver the goods.  People

34:24.419 --> 34:30.438
knew about Kundalini, but they didn’t want
to read because they were told, “No, No,

34:30.438 --> 34:35.878
don’t read, this is very wrong,” and all
that.

34:35.878 --> 34:44.848
So spirituality is a subject absolutely unknown
to the western people, though Christ was there

34:44.848 --> 34:53.448
but they have been only crucifying Him.
If I see the Christianity, if I see Christ,

34:53.448 --> 35:00.398
it’s so organized.  From Christianity nobody
can get out.  Whatever sin you may commit,

35:00.398 --> 35:08.368
you are still a Christian.  I know there
was a fellow who murdered someone and he was

35:08.368 --> 35:09.368
taken to the courts.

35:09.368 --> 35:11.038
They said, “What are you?”

35:11.038 --> 35:14.108
And he said, “I am a Christian,” though
he had murdered.

35:14.108 --> 35:17.869
Then they gave him the Bible, “All right,
put your hand on the Bible and say you are

35:17.869 --> 35:21.388
a Christian.”

35:21.388 --> 35:26.598
He said, “I am a Christian, I believe in
Bible.” But why didn’t they ask, “Why

35:26.598 --> 35:31.968
did you kill then?”  Thou shalt not kill.

35:31.968 --> 35:38.588
So even these religions which were formed
did not have any rules or regulations that

35:38.588 --> 35:45.038
“All right, if somebody does like that we’ll
throw him out of our congregation or he is

35:45.038 --> 35:51.458
no more a Christian.”  On the contrary,
you’ll be surprised that when My father

35:51.458 --> 36:02.538
joined Congress in India to fight against
the British, they threw him out of the congregation

36:02.538 --> 36:08.238
because according to the missionaries there,
Christ was born in England.  He must be

36:08.238 --> 36:16.438
an Englishman, so how dare My father join
the Congress?  Such an absurd idea!

36:16.438 --> 36:23.968
So all these ideas which are so absurd, against
God - against religion, against spirituality

36:23.968 --> 36:32.668
- became very prevalent and useful and convenient
for these organized religions.  That’s

36:32.668 --> 36:39.118
one thing good about Hindu religion is there
is nothing like a organization.  So they

36:39.118 --> 36:45.378
can be agnostic, atheist, they can be anything.
They could be Buddhist, they could be Jains.

36:45.378 --> 36:51.738
They could be anything and they could be Christians,
but they could be Hindus also because it’s

36:51.738 --> 36:57.479
not organized and because they are not organized,
there is no restriction on them that “Don’t

36:57.479 --> 37:02.628
do like this; don’t do like that.”  But
despite that I have seen, I’m surprised

37:02.628 --> 37:07.829
that Hindus are very meek people because the
responsibility is left to themselves, not

37:07.829 --> 37:13.138
on an organization.   If you have murdered
somebody you are not to confess to the priest

37:13.138 --> 37:19.938
but confess to yourself and face yourself
all the time. But so many filthy things crawled

37:19.938 --> 37:29.958
into this religion, also, of caste system
which is just against Shri Krishna.  They

37:29.958 --> 37:35.338
have no business to take Shri Krishna’s
name and do all these nonsensical things because

37:35.338 --> 37:43.378
Shri Krishna Himself has said that, “In
everybody it resides.” But they changed

37:43.378 --> 37:47.868
it a little, saying that, “Your caste is
according to your birth.”  How can it be?

37:47.868 --> 37:49.668
 As I told you the other day.

37:49.668 --> 38:04.428
Now this is another story I would say that
they have tried to, Christ look like something

38:04.428 --> 38:09.498
very ordinary or even Shri Krishna look like
something ordinary.  These are the intellectuals.

38:09.498 --> 38:15.448
So on one side we have the stupid followers
and the another side we have those stupid

38:15.448 --> 38:27.378
intellectuals.  So the message of Krishna
never reached Hindus because He said, “In

38:27.378 --> 38:33.058
everybody resides the Spirit and you are part
and parcel of the whole.”   Now a cell

38:33.058 --> 38:44.488
in the hand, is it an outcast because it is
not in the brain?  So what a wrong thing

38:44.488 --> 38:53.508
they have done to Shri Krishna and that’s
why when they suffer from racialism, I say,

38:53.508 --> 39:00.658
“You did the same to the caste, through
your caste system you tortured the Harigans,

39:00.658 --> 39:11.118
you tortured the lower caste of people.
So now you have them.”  It boomerangs,

39:11.118 --> 39:13.067
whole thing.

39:13.067 --> 39:21.307
So Shri Krishna’s life, if you see, is the
beauty of it is that He said that “Life

39:21.307 --> 39:32.648
is a leela” - for Him, not for everyone,
because He is so powerful. And this leela

39:32.648 --> 39:39.537
part was taken over by Americans very nicely
because they were born in the land of Shri

39:39.537 --> 39:44.428
Krishna, that it’s all leela. “What’s
wrong? Do what you like, what’s wrong?”

39:44.428 --> 39:49.988
Whatever you are doing is just a leela, is
just a play. So what?   Marry as many as

39:49.988 --> 39:55.478
you like, leave your children to dogs, do
all kinds of things with your morality, destroy

39:55.478 --> 40:02.438
yourself morning till evening, behave in the
same manner as if they are animals. So what?

40:02.438 --> 40:06.169
Study the animal behavior because it’s as
if we have no sense of behavior, so we study

40:06.169 --> 40:10.277
the animal behavior and behave like the animals.

40:10.277 --> 40:17.128
So are we going to become now snakes or some
sort of worms or I don’t know what they

40:17.128 --> 40:29.918
are up to, and whole system is just the opposite
of Shri Krishna.  So this stupid movement

40:29.918 --> 40:36.698
of Shri Krishna’s consciousness reached
there.  I don’t know how they understood

40:36.698 --> 40:42.548
that Shri Krishna is the deity of America,
but somehow some bhoot must have told them

40:42.548 --> 40:49.808
that “You go there.”  And they are another
stupid people who are selling Gita, selling

40:49.808 --> 41:00.448
this bookish knowledge, but now of course
it has boomeranged on him and now they are

41:00.448 --> 41:10.777
all right.  Now they are frozen. But the
way they have been talking about Shri Krishna,

41:10.777 --> 41:16.578
they do not realize they have missed the point.
He said, “It’s a leela.” So then why

41:16.578 --> 41:21.478
are you wearing these dresses, why have you
become a sanyasi?  Why are you giving up

41:21.478 --> 41:30.648
- not to eat this food, not to eat that food?
And then they are taking drugs, they are selling

41:30.648 --> 41:31.648
drugs.

41:31.648 --> 41:39.918
Whatever is not based on truth will go to
something that is destructive.  Truth is

41:39.918 --> 41:46.758
the only thing that is constructive.  All
these ideas sometimes confuse us, what is

41:46.758 --> 41:51.668
this, in the name of God, in the name of Shri
Krishna, in the name of Christ, in the name

41:51.668 --> 42:00.558
of Mohammed Sahib all these things are done
and also some people do it even in My name,

42:00.558 --> 42:07.508
“Mother said; Mother said so.”  It is
prohibited for Sahaja yogi to say that because

42:07.508 --> 42:15.088
I’ve had enough of it in last lives.
So this life nobody is going to say, “Mother

42:15.088 --> 42:17.988
said it.”

42:17.988 --> 42:27.338
“I say.” Have that much confidence and
responsibility to say, “I say.”   I

42:27.338 --> 42:33.178
am a Sahaja Yogi, you are a Sahaja Yogi, why
can’t you say?

42:33.178 --> 42:42.708
So now from today’s Puja onward we have
awakened the Shri Krishna within us, so His

42:42.708 --> 42:50.119
powers of sweetness as well of destruction
will act and you don’t have to worry, you

42:50.119 --> 42:53.808
are completely protected.  He has already
said that “Yoga dakshemo myam.”  “I

42:53.808 --> 43:01.158
give you yoga” and the “dakshemo myam”
means your benevolence, He looks after.

43:01.158 --> 43:12.878
So you don’t have to worry, but it will
act and it will work and nobody can harm you.

43:12.878 --> 43:22.598
It will all boomerang on them.  There’s
like divine punishment and you don’t have

43:22.598 --> 43:29.738
to worry.  Of course, as a Mother, I never
feel of punishing anyone, as such, but they

43:29.738 --> 43:36.688
just get punished, what can I do?  And now
this awakening can be very dangerous, so I

43:36.688 --> 43:44.828
think we have to accept it now within ourselves
that we have to be extremely sweet, nice,

43:44.828 --> 43:45.828
collective.

43:45.828 --> 43:51.408
If you are not collective then Krishna will
be after your life.  If you try to destroy

43:51.408 --> 43:55.618
collectivity He will be after you, I mean
He is a tremendous person, I tell you.  He

43:55.618 --> 44:02.038
is so tricky, He is so clever, and He is a
very smooth worker, I tell you.  So be careful.

44:02.038 --> 44:08.288
If you are collective then He’ll strengthen
you, He’ll nourish you, He’ll do everything,

44:08.288 --> 44:16.068
He’ll give you butter to eat.  So you have
to be collective, that’s the main part.

44:16.068 --> 44:20.968
And those people who just come to the program
and then disappear should know that it won’t

44:20.968 --> 44:26.348
work out.  You have to be collective and
if they don’t want to be collective, we

44:26.348 --> 44:31.468
don’t want to force them. But if they are
not collective they are not Sahaja Yogis and

44:31.468 --> 44:37.628
nobody should recommend them to anyone and
Sahaja Yogis should have nothing to do with

44:37.628 --> 44:46.838
non-collective people nor with people who
are not Sahaja Yogis.

44:46.838 --> 44:50.928
We have very beautiful children here, we have
beautiful families.   We have everything

44:50.928 --> 44:57.158
so beautiful, such beautiful people to love
each other and enjoy each other.  So we should

44:57.158 --> 45:03.768
not get entangled into the mess of other people
who are blind.  It would be like we have

45:03.768 --> 45:08.638
a nice organized place where everybody is
sitting in the light, suddenly you want to

45:08.638 --> 45:16.298
go to the place where there are many snakes
inhabited who are biting everyone.  So go

45:16.298 --> 45:21.418
ahead and then you shouldn’t say that “Mother,
you punished me.”   You wanted to go into

45:21.418 --> 45:29.158
the hell of the snakes, so you go and have
it.  I never punish. But maybe Shri Krishna

45:29.158 --> 45:38.458
might lure you there, you see that’s His
style, just to have a little bite of a snake.

45:38.458 --> 45:44.568
So according to Shri Krishna, we have to be
very playful.  Now we are all realized people,

45:44.568 --> 45:50.688
and you are very happy and you are all very
playful and joyous and also now you are so

45:50.688 --> 45:57.978
capable, you have spirituality, you can give
Realization to others.  Even I was told that

45:57.978 --> 46:06.168
in the streets people ask for Realization,
some people went to Eastern Blocs and they

46:06.168 --> 46:13.619
got five thousand people.  Somebody went
down to Argentina, got so many people.  So

46:13.619 --> 46:18.888
it’s very good, all these, My hands are
extending and the work is taking place.

46:18.888 --> 46:20.438
Everybody should take it up.

46:20.438 --> 46:24.208
Select a place and I’ll go there and work
it out.  Select one place and work it out,

46:24.208 --> 46:29.987
all of you can do it because you have now
got the powers, better work it out, use them.

46:29.987 --> 46:34.777
If you don’t use the powers, you’ll become
blunt, so use your powers and believe that

46:34.777 --> 46:40.488
you have power and that only thing you have
to keep in the bounds, in the maryadas of

46:40.488 --> 46:50.468
Sahaja Yoga, that you have to lead a very
moral, good life and you must feel your vibrations

46:50.468 --> 46:59.198
properly and keep good health which you can
easily do.  If, as they say, I can work like

46:59.198 --> 47:03.878
this, days in, day out, you can also work.
You are all very young, everybody seems to

47:03.878 --> 47:11.758
be younger than Me.  I am the oldest person
here.   So if I could do so much, why can’t

47:11.758 --> 47:12.758
you?

47:12.758 --> 47:16.818
So one thing you must ask in your prayer in
the evening when you are sleeping: “What

47:16.818 --> 47:23.008
have I done for Sahaja Yoga?” One sentence,
all of you, just ask this question: “What

47:23.008 --> 47:35.348
have I done for Sahaja Yoga?”   Like persons
like Me or Shri Krishna or anyone, We don’t

47:35.348 --> 47:40.038
even feel We are doing anything.  So what
can We ask?   If I want to ask Myself, I’ll

47:40.038 --> 47:44.798
fall into an ocean I think, I don’t know,
I’ll be lost.  If I want to analyze Myself, I

47:44.798 --> 47:49.768
get lost.  If I want to think about Myself,
I get lost.  It’s beyond Me, then let it

47:49.768 --> 47:58.888
be, doesn’t matter.  I don’t want to
know Myself. But you better know yourself.

47:58.888 --> 48:01.038
You can’t be Me.

48:01.038 --> 48:09.808
So as far as I am concerned I only think that
as long as I live - I don’t know, I may

48:09.808 --> 48:15.358
live forever, I am living forever maybe, you
might say that, but whatever it is as long

48:15.358 --> 48:36.668
as I’m on this earth I will see that Sahaja
Yoga is fully established.  This is My promise

48:36.668 --> 48:37.678
to you.

48:37.678 --> 48:38.678
[Maharathi]

48:38.678 --> 48:45.038
He comes on this earth again to establish
the religion, but not only religion but Vishwa

48:45.038 --> 48:51.308
Nirmala Dharma, which is a much higher religion
than the ordinary religion of human beings.

48:51.308 --> 48:52.308
within themselves, is the Vishwa Nirmala Dharma
we’ll establish in a very short time, I’m

48:52.308 --> 48:53.308
sure, on this earth.

48:53.308 --> 48:54.308
So may God bless you!

48:54.308 --> 48:55.308
So today the children are sleeping now – if
they can get up for a while they can come

48:55.308 --> 48:56.308
and wash My feet.  How many are awake?
Some are awake.  You can sing some Ganesha

48:56.308 --> 48:57.308
song instead of Atharva Sheersha.
(break in recording)

48:57.308 --> 48:58.308
…. no provision for this kind of acceptance
of these ornaments, but when he came he just

48:58.308 --> 48:59.308
tried to take everything that was in that
temple.  At that time the story was created,

48:59.308 --> 49:00.308
I don’t know how far it is true, but a story
of Indians, you see, Indian style.  The story

49:00.308 --> 49:01.308
was like this: that when Mahadeva was attacked
by him, He started running away from the temple.

49:01.308 --> 49:02.308
He was running, running, running, running
fast and then He found Bhairava sitting there.

49:02.308 --> 49:03.308
So Bhairava and Hanumana both were sitting
and They said, “You are the Devas of Devas,

49:03.308 --> 49:04.308
You are the Mahadeva of Devas and why are
You running?  After all, what is he, this

49:04.308 --> 49:05.308
Tamolang?  Why running? He was lame with
one foot and why are you running away from

49:05.308 --> 49:06.308
him? You can just finish him off; what is
the need to run away?”

49:06.308 --> 49:07.308
No, he was Mohammed Gazni. Sorry, he was Mohammed
Gazni who did it, but  Tamolanga also attacked

49:07.308 --> 49:08.308
but then Mohammed Gazni. So this Mohammed
Gazni was running after Mahadeva, and first Tamolanga

49:08.308 --> 49:09.308
has looted but he couldn’t go to that far,
so this Mohammed Gazni came in and he started

49:09.308 --> 49:10.308
looting that temple.  So then when he started
running after Mahadeva, Mahadeva told him,

49:10.308 --> 49:11.308
“You don’t know, you don’t know this
Mohammed Gazni, who is. His name is Mohammed

49:11.308 --> 49:12.308
Gazni but he is somebody else.”

49:12.308 --> 49:13.308
Said, “Who is he?”

49:13.308 --> 49:14.308
“All right, come, you hide here, I’ll
show you.”

49:14.308 --> 49:15.308
So behind Mahadeva was running Mohammed Gazni,
so they hid themselves on one side and they

49:15.308 --> 49:16.308
saw this Mohammed Gazni came and he was very
tired.  He sat down near one tree and he

49:16.308 --> 49:17.308
started just relaxing, and suddenly they found
it was Shri Krishna.  He said, “This valundar,”

49:17.308 --> 49:18.308
means this, this cunning fellow, “is running
after me, now do you think I may escape him?

49:18.308 --> 49:19.308
Of course I should have punished these Brahmins
who were misbehaving.  I did not so, he has

49:19.308 --> 49:20.308
come, but now I cannot help so I am away out
of it, you see, because this one has come

49:20.308 --> 49:21.308
after My life and now you cannot save yourself.”

49:21.308 --> 49:22.308
So this is the story the people, the general
public, created there.  So it has happened

49:22.308 --> 49:23.308
many a times because He was the brother of
the Shakti of Shiva and because He’s so

49:23.308 --> 49:24.308
clever, he’s so intelligent that Shiva was
quite afraid of Him, and overactive.   So

49:24.308 --> 49:25.308
you see Americans are extremely active people
and now, of course, England, we need not say.

49:25.308 --> 49:26.308
It’s a little lethargic, little bit, not
much.  So now the awakening of Shri Krishna

49:26.308 --> 49:27.308
is going to work everywhere, and you are all
going to be extremely active about Sahaja

49:27.308 --> 49:28.308
Yoga, I think so.  This is a new thing that
has happened, and I’m very happy it has

49:28.308 --> 49:29.308
happened and that the Americans also agreed
to come here.  By this we take a little bit

49:29.308 --> 49:30.308
of the qualities of Shiva to America, that
is of magnanimity and also of laziness a little

49:30.308 --> 49:31.308
bit, and give some qualities of Shri Krishna
to this country.  This exchanges it.

49:31.308 --> 49:32.308
Shri Krishna Puja 1990: Shri Mataji speaks
about the music to be played by the musicians.

49:32.308 --> 49:33.308
Below is a transcription of the relevant details.

49:33.308 --> 49:34.308
Now the last raga is Bhairavi has to be played
under all traditional ways and is a raga that

49:34.308 --> 49:35.308
is in praise of the power of the Spirit, because
it has such beautiful notes and notes which

49:35.308 --> 49:36.308
are … it’s a complete sampurna, is a complete
raga. All the twelve notes are in it. So you

49:36.308 --> 49:37.308
see it is such a complete raga and it has
to be played in all due respect to it. It’s

49:37.308 --> 49:38.308
a ragini, regarded as.

49:38.308 --> 49:39.308
Now as you know that the Heart Chakra has
got twelve petals, and the Durga resides on

49:39.308 --> 49:40.308
the Heart Chakra. Now the Durga’s qualities
are that She is protective of Her children,

49:40.308 --> 49:41.308
She’s very gentle, very soft with Her children,
and She’s extremely horrifying to the satanic

49:41.308 --> 49:42.308
people, to the negative people. So in this
raga I think because there are, the notes

49:42.308 --> 49:43.308
are spaced out. So either you could play it
slow or you could play it fast. Nothing in

49:43.308 --> 49:44.308
between. That’s why it is on a Durga’s
style. You see, either She is extremely gentle

49:44.308 --> 49:45.308
or She is extremely horrifying. So because
She has a double function: is one to look

49:45.308 --> 49:46.308
after Her children, and another is protect
Her children from the devils. So She has to

49:46.308 --> 49:47.308
be very quick about it, to fight them, and
to, in every way to frighten them and to be

49:47.308 --> 49:48.308
alert about it.

49:48.308 --> 49:49.308
So in the second part you all became very
alerted I saw. In the first part you were

49:49.308 --> 49:50.308
having a lullaby because it was the Mother’s
love that was playing. The second part you

49:50.308 --> 49:51.308
became alert, because She has to fight. Now,
this is such a nice raga because it gives

49:51.308 --> 49:52.308
you a better sense of security within yourself,
builds up sense of security, and also as you

49:52.308 --> 49:53.308
know medically that it’s important to build
up this chakra because that gives you antibodies

49:53.308 --> 49:54.308
created. So to fight all the diseases, to
fight all the foreign things which try to

49:54.308 --> 49:55.308
attack us.

49:55.308 --> 49:56.308
So this raga is so apt, absolutely apt for
today’s atmosphere and for today’s need.

49:56.308 --> 49:57.308
That we have to have the security of the Mother
and the protection of the Mother and that

49:57.308 --> 49:58.308
all the evil forces must be finished from
this world, and that’s how this raga has

49:58.308 --> 49:59.308
a very great significance and I thank him
very much for playing this raga.

49:59.308 --> 50:00.308
This is, now the last five minutes he would
like to play is the Bhairavi which is a complete

50:00.308 --> 50:01.308
raga as you can call it, is the complete purnima.
All the notes are there. And it is played

50:01.308 --> 50:02.308
in various ways and various styles and is
used for so many expressions of your feelings

50:02.308 --> 50:03.308
and thing. But in this also there’s a beautiful
song as you know, the Anhi Bhavani, is the

50:03.308 --> 50:04.308
one which is a song about the Mother Goddess.
And in this Anhi Bhavani, I think there is

50:04.308 --> 50:05.308
a little mixture in the … I don’t know
if it is absolutely pure Bhairavi or not.

50:05.308 --> 50:06.308
Shri Mataji asks musicians: It is to be played
absolutely in Shuddha Bhairavi?

50:06.308 --> 50:07.308
(Shri Mataji and musicians discuss together
a little then She asserts ... )

50:07.308 --> 50:08.308
It should be played in pure Bhairavi – this
is the best way. Because Bhairavi is the name

50:08.308 --> 50:09.308
of the Goddess.

50:09.308 --> 50:10.308
You see the purity of it creates that feeling
and that, I mean, it awakens that deity so

50:10.308 --> 50:11.308
that you get that effect with the Bhairavi.

50:11.308 --> 50:12.308
(Shri Mataji and musicians talk together then
She continues ... )

50:12.308 --> 50:13.308
Indian music has such a lot of freedom, such
a lot of freedom. You can do what you like

50:13.308 --> 50:14.308
with it. But only thing is you have to keep
to the ragas and you have to keep to the Swaras

50:14.308 --> 50:15.308
and everything. You cannot just go crazy from
one to another like that. So it is like a

50:15.308 --> 50:16.308
big aeroplane which is going in the air with
everything completely fixed properly. You

50:16.308 --> 50:17.308
see, so it can go anywhere. Unless and until
it’s fixed, has it’s own maryadas it cannot

50:17.308 --> 50:18.308
go. So that has to be there. So first the
ragas are built, and built in such a way they

50:18.308 --> 50:19.308
are absolutely perfect and then you can go
wherever you feel like. Nothing will happen.

50:19.308 --> 50:20.308
(More discussion with musicians.)

50:20.308 --> 50:21.308
(Raga begins. Shri Mataji continues ...)

50:21.308 --> 50:22.308
First, he will play all the twelve notes which
are built in Bhairavi and then you will see

50:22.308 --> 50:23.308
how he keeps to that. He keeps to that

50:23.308 --> 50:24.308
Wow, wow! It’s the Heart Chakra. It’s
the Heart Chakra of Shiva.

50:24.308 --> 50:25.308
(Musicians continue to play.)

50:25.308 --> 50:26.308
The surrendering, you see. Islam is surrender.
Islam is the surrender.

50:26.308 --> 50:27.308
(Musicians continue to play.)

50:27.308 --> 50:28.308
Musician: In India it used to be different
about thirty or forty years ago, this is the

50:28.308 --> 50:29.308
kind of music we used to have, when people
would sit like you are, here, so nice, so

50:29.308 --> 50:30.308
beautiful, a family.

50:30.308 --> 50:31.308
Shri Mataji: Absolutely a family rapport.

50:31.308 --> 50:32.308
Musician: Absolutely

50:32.308 --> 50:33.308
Musician: You bring out that from us.

50:33.308 --> 50:34.308
Shri Mataji: You see what he’s saying is
this. You know I am such an old woman of sixty-seven

50:34.308 --> 50:35.308
years and I think of My childhood and also
of My family. My father was a great, great

50:35.308 --> 50:36.308
connoisseur of music and he supported music,
and musicians left and right, and we heard

50:36.308 --> 50:37.308
all the musicians because they would come
to our house, stay with us and he would go

50:37.308 --> 50:38.308
all out to spend for them, pay for them; I
mean, do all kinds of things. So in the family

50:38.308 --> 50:39.308
the music came in and then My sister took
to music and everybody in family took to music

50:39.308 --> 50:40.308
quite a lot because of My father because he
was fond of cricket and also of music very

50:40.308 --> 50:41.308
much. But the best part of it, what I am feeling,
all the family would sit down and then My

50:41.308 --> 50:42.308
sister would sing or anybody, you see the
rapport. Then he would give the, what you

50:42.308 --> 50:43.308
call, the impetus, he would give us the feelings
of: “Now, this is it now coming up.”

50:43.308 --> 50:44.308
There’s such a rapport in the whole thing
between the musician and all, and with such

50:44.308 --> 50:45.308
relaxation everybody appreciating it and just
like waves after waves of a big ocean coming

50:45.308 --> 50:46.308
over and that sort of a thing it was. And
then only you can enjoy music. But if you

50:46.308 --> 50:47.308
are worried about time, this, that… we give
up all that to listen to music. And even if

50:47.308 --> 50:48.308
you carry all that load with you, what’s
the use of listening to music? You have to

50:48.308 --> 50:49.308
come to music with all these things left out
and then you really enjoy the whole thing.

50:49.308 --> 50:50.308
And that is what today I feel that our whole
family of Sahaja Yogis are enjoying this rapport

50:50.308 --> 50:51.308
with him and enjoying the whole beauty of
the whole music, it’s something so great.

50:51.308 --> 50:52.308
But see the surrendering, you just develop
the feeling what you get out of it, you see

50:52.308 --> 50:53.308
like….

50:53.308 --> 50:53.310
(Music continues.)
