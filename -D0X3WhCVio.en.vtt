00:00:05.567 --> 00:00:07.521
Now what is the Realization?

00:00:07.601 --> 00:00:17.187
It is that if you see at the base of the spinal
chord is a triangular bone called as ‘Sacrum’.

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:24.821
It is called ‘Sacrum’ because it is a sacred bone
and the Greeks knew about it, that it’s a sacred bone.

00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:30.953
And according to our Shastras
and also many other prophecies,

00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:38.654
there resides a power within us, our own
power, your own power called as Kundalini.

00:00:38.734 --> 00:00:44.421
Is called ‘Kundalini’ because
it is in three and a half coils.

00:00:44.501 --> 00:00:49.287
Coils are called ‘kundal’, that’s why it is the Kundalini.

00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:54.621
Now this, this power is your own.

00:00:54.701 --> 00:01:03.554
It’s in every human being and if it is
awakened, it passes through six centers

00:01:03.634 --> 00:01:10.554
piercing through the top of the head, which we
call as the Brahmarandhra in the Sanskrit language

00:01:10.634 --> 00:01:14.320
and the fontanel area in the English language.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.821
It passes through that soft bone
which was there in the childhood

00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:23.953
and you just start feeling the cool
breeze coming out of your head

00:01:24.033 --> 00:01:28.454
and the cool breeze coming
on to your fingertips. It happens!

00:01:28.534 --> 00:01:33.454
It’s an experience and for which you cannot pay. You cannot.

00:01:33.534 --> 00:01:37.120
I may go on telling you lots of
stories this, that, that won’t work out.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.754
It has to happen.

00:01:38.834 --> 00:01:44.154
The Kundalini has to rise and
has to pierce through fontanel area

00:01:44.234 --> 00:01:51.454
otherwise, otherwise, it’s no use, it’s just
words, some sermon or something like that.

00:01:51.534 --> 00:01:58.854
So this happening is very easy in this Kaliyuga.

00:01:58.934 --> 00:02:03.254
Is really remarkable because maybe because of Kaliyug

00:02:03.334 --> 00:02:09.554
people are fed up of the things going
on and all kinds of things working out.

00:02:09.634 --> 00:02:11.821
Now what does it do?

00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:15.187
It passes through six center.

00:02:15.267 --> 00:02:23.320
Six centers, these are meant for our
physical, mental, and emotional being

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.454
and also for our spiritual being.

00:02:26.534 --> 00:02:33.254
So when it passes through these
six centers, it nourishes those centers,

00:02:33.334 --> 00:02:40.053
it integrates all these centers,
and ultimately it passes through this

00:02:40.133 --> 00:02:47.254
and enters into the all pervading power of
Divine love, is called as ‘Paramchaitanya’.

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:55.053
You may call it as ‘all pervading
power of Divine love’ or anything

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:57.387
but names make no difference.

00:02:57.467 --> 00:03:02.554
There is a very subtle power
around us, which looks after us,

00:03:02.634 --> 00:03:08.320
which guides us, which helps us, which is the torsion area.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.721
Now, while doing that what happens
that you become knowledgeable

00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:18.287
of the absolute truth, absolute!

00:03:18.367 --> 00:03:26.053
Whatever you know is absolute, is
nothing to doubt, nothing can be challenged.

00:03:26.133 --> 00:03:30.888
For example, it starts flowing through your fingertips.

00:03:30.968 --> 00:03:36.754
Starts flowing through your fingertips and
you can feel it on your fingertips, your centers.

00:03:36.834 --> 00:03:41.687
Now these are five, six, and seven
centers, five, six and seven centers.

00:03:41.767 --> 00:03:43.953
I am not going to tell you all the details now.

00:03:44.033 --> 00:03:55.920
But when you start feeling these whole sensation,
Adi Shankaracharya has called it as ‘spand’,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.354
then you feel the truth, the real truth.

00:04:02.434 --> 00:04:07.687
For example, supposing in your
office you get somebody who is a cheat,

00:04:07.767 --> 00:04:14.120
very well dressed, speaks English
very well, you know, very well behaved.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.120
How will you make him out?

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.187
Just have to put your hands under
your table and see for yourself.

00:04:20.267 --> 00:04:29.020
Immediately you will get some sort of a
burning sensation or you might feel some sort of a,

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.120
what do you call, needle and pins like that.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.254
That kind of a feeling you might get.

00:04:34.334 --> 00:04:39.320
Then you will also know what
centers he’s catching on your fingertips.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.487
This is the absolute knowledge about everything.

00:04:42.567 --> 00:04:48.454
Is not question of only knowing he is a
bad or a good person, but also of diseases.

00:04:48.534 --> 00:04:54.053
Supposing you have some disease,
you will feel it on your fingertips.

00:04:54.133 --> 00:04:56.220
On your fingertips you’ll feel it.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.454
You’ll know this is your disease
and if you know how to cure them,

00:05:00.534 --> 00:05:04.788
you can cure others also because
you become one with the whole.

00:05:04.868 --> 00:05:09.953
It’s a very collective personality you develop.
