1
00:00:02,897 --> 00:00:13,282
It has been such a great treat for us,
not only entertainment,

2
00:00:14,872 --> 00:00:23,531
but the way for our future – how to move
and what to do.

3
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:32,813
It’s very surprising that this Swiss bank
business

4
00:00:33,014 --> 00:00:39,548
has been attracting My attention
all the time.

5
00:00:40,169 --> 00:00:46,509
I don’t know much, how they can digest
everything so well.

6
00:00:49,245 --> 00:00:56,296
In these modern times, when people are
talking of democracy,

7
00:00:56,497 --> 00:00:59,927
talking of very big ideal things and
all that,

8
00:01:00,128 --> 00:01:09,515
at the same time how can such a illegal
system exist openly?

9
00:01:10,495 --> 00:01:14,835
And for that I have a plan.

10
00:01:15,036 --> 00:01:21,838
As Arneau has said I have to expose, I have
a plan to do something about it.

11
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:27,988
As far as the materialism is concerned,
it’s working out.

12
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:34,995
All these countries who were supposed to
be very advanced, developed are suffering;

13
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:39,952
first from recession – and a terrible
recession.

14
00:01:40,153 --> 00:01:43,952
That recession is going to give them
a lesson

15
00:01:44,175 --> 00:01:52,341
about overproduction of nonsensical goods.

16
00:01:52,628 --> 00:02:00,438
Materialism comes because people have
gone mad with their greed.

17
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:09,977
I was searching a house in England – went
round to see houses, and I was surprised

18
00:02:10,178 --> 00:02:15,569
that all kinds of plastic things and mixed
things and all that,

19
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,713
were piled up in mountains in every house,
mountains!

20
00:02:19,914 --> 00:02:27,868
And you pass through a door you will find
two legs of a pant falling on you.

21
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:31,683
But not only in England, same in Paris:

22
00:02:31,884 --> 00:02:36,895
I’ve seen people accumulating so much
of nonsense

23
00:02:37,096 --> 00:02:41,472
that they don’t know where to put it and
what to do.

24
00:02:42,155 --> 00:02:46,301
This madness is on and on and on.

25
00:02:46,502 --> 00:02:52,982
Now, I have found out a solution for Sahaja
Yogis, what they should do.

26
00:02:53,183 --> 00:02:57,838
They should try to encourage handicrafts.

27
00:02:58,701 --> 00:03:03,376
Every country I went to, I bought
handicrafts,

28
00:03:03,577 --> 00:03:11,399
whether it was Czechoslovakia or England
or anywhere.

29
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,972
I cannot understand – how can you go
and buy this rubbish of plastic,

30
00:03:18,173 --> 00:03:20,673
of these useless things?

31
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:24,275
And these handicrafts, when I bought,
I was surprised –

32
00:03:24,476 --> 00:03:31,540
I must tell you about Czechoslovakia that
there were small, small, very small shops

33
00:03:31,741 --> 00:03:35,950
and they all came, one by one, “Mother,
buy something from us also,

34
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:41,091
Mother buy something from us”. You know,
I was surprised, such beautiful things.

35
00:03:41,292 --> 00:03:48,759
They said, “We cannot sell them.” But all
nonsensical things people are buying.

36
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,568
So for Sahaja Yogis, they must take a vow

37
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:55,485
that “we’ll only take things which are
handmade”.

38
00:03:55,686 --> 00:04:03,659
You need not have many things, you can
have few, but something handmade.

39
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:10,247
Now, supposing you get a dress, there
should be some handmade embroidery

40
00:04:10,448 --> 00:04:16,660
or something put it on that, so some labor
is put in into that.

41
00:04:18,735 --> 00:04:27,226
It is very difficult to see how people
go in for things

42
00:04:27,405 --> 00:04:35,368
which are very cheap and extremely
troublesome.

43
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:38,809
I must tell you one thing, I can’t wear
nylon,

44
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:43,130
I can’t wear anything artificial, really,
I can’t.

45
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:48,644
For a while, if I even wear socks also,
My whole body starts paining.

46
00:04:48,845 --> 00:04:51,581
So, it is against you.

47
00:04:51,782 --> 00:05:00,956
Handmade things are few, I agree, but use
as far as possible handmade things.

48
00:05:01,157 --> 00:05:06,750
From the Mother Earth they make very nice,
say, terracotta.

49
00:05:06,951 --> 00:05:10,611
So, I’m a socialist by temperament,
I think.

50
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:21,348
So, I felt a great urge that I should
really export nothing but terracotta.

51
00:05:21,865 --> 00:05:25,643
And terracotta is such a beautiful thing.

52
00:05:25,844 --> 00:05:30,584
It’s so soothing, it’s so good – it smells
so well.

53
00:05:30,785 --> 00:05:34,935
But people think, “No, we should buy
something that is made

54
00:05:35,136 --> 00:05:42,988
from America in some machinery thing.”
They go on buying like that.

55
00:05:44,182 --> 00:05:49,819
In America also I was surprised that
beautiful things are selling

56
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:54,730
in shops which they call them as outlets,
very good,

57
00:05:55,008 --> 00:06:04,476
mostly of silk, or of cotton, and leather –
pure leather.

58
00:06:04,677 --> 00:06:08,148
But people will go to big, big markets
and buy all nonsense

59
00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:13,511
at a very high price and not from there –
means they have no wisdom.

60
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:19,514
And this is what happens, that the wisdom,
if it is lacking in your sense,

61
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:25,310
then this wisdom corrodes the society.

62
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:30,643
Because wisdom itself shows

63
00:06:30,844 --> 00:06:36,908
how dangerous it is to go on buying all
these nonsensical things.

64
00:06:37,473 --> 00:06:42,442
Also now you are seeing that people
are taking now more

65
00:06:42,643 --> 00:06:46,619
to Ayurveda and to homeopathy.

66
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:52,733
They don’t want to use these horrible
medicines produced by your great country.

67
00:06:52,934 --> 00:07:01,967
You know what they do, Swiss? They send
very big offers

68
00:07:02,168 --> 00:07:06,018
to doctors from India to come to work
for them.

69
00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:10,783
And supposing they have produced one “A”
sample as you’ve shown,

70
00:07:10,984 --> 00:07:14,924
then the same one they change a little bit
(and) say “It’s better”.

71
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:20,713
And you know these medicines, most of them
are very dangerous and troublesome.

72
00:07:20,914 --> 00:07:24,937
By mistake, My family gave Me these
antibiotics.

73
00:07:25,138 --> 00:07:30,888
Since then My legs are very weak and
troublesome – I’ve improved, no doubt.

74
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:34,718
So, you see, why we are now taking
to this -

75
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:40,306
because pollution is there another thing,
which is created by this machinery.

76
00:07:40,507 --> 00:07:45,204
Gandhiji was saying: “There is no need
to use so much machinery.”

77
00:07:45,405 --> 00:07:51,505
Now, motor cars – we can walk, we can
use trains,

78
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:57,793
but people want to go anywhere by motor
car, even if it is about, say,

79
00:07:57,994 --> 00:08:03,530
ten meters, they don’t want to walk.
That’s how our health has gone down.

80
00:08:03,731 --> 00:08:09,489
I must tell you when I was studying in the
school, My school was about five miles.

81
00:08:09,653 --> 00:08:17,234
And we had a car, and we had also horses,
and what we call is a buggy in our house.

82
00:08:17,435 --> 00:08:22,668
But it was compulsory for us to walk
five miles in the morning.

83
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,454
Evening time the car used to come,

84
00:08:25,655 --> 00:08:32,039
but morning time we all had to walk
five miles to go to our school.

85
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,097
And in between there was a small, little
mountain which we had to climb.

86
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:45,390
That is how we learnt about nature. If you
don’t walk, from the car what do you know?

87
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:49,621
At the most you can see some lamppost.

88
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:55,603
What do you see from the car? Nothing,
you cannot see the nature.

89
00:08:55,803 --> 00:09:02,667
And this walking system is very much out
of date now for people. People don’t walk.

90
00:09:03,682 --> 00:09:10,487
I’m not saying that today we are very
changed, and we are very advanced people.

91
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:15,749
In a way we have gone down because
we cannot walk.

92
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:20,019
God has given these legs to walk, but
we cannot walk.

93
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:26,532
We avoid walking. Now, because of that
so many cars.

94
00:09:27,426 --> 00:09:33,070
I know that in some families they have
five cars because 5 family members.

95
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:37,737
Especially in Spain, I was surprised,
so many cars, so many cars

96
00:09:37,938 --> 00:09:42,739
and every car has only one person in it
sitting.

97
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:48,217
Now, problem has started with the pollution
and all these things,

98
00:09:48,418 --> 00:09:54,864
because we have lost the habits
of depending upon ourselves.

99
00:09:55,605 --> 00:10:04,165
Now see what has happened in, say,

100
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:10,662
this Kuala Lumpur and all these places
suffering from what you call, the smoke.

101
00:10:10,872 --> 00:10:15,654
Now I have not done it, if you think that
way. And they are praying to Allah,

102
00:10:15,855 --> 00:10:18,908
“Give us water”. Why should God give
them water

103
00:10:19,109 --> 00:10:23,966
when they are doing all kinds of
nonsensical things?

104
00:10:24,688 --> 00:10:29,449
Now, there is smoke going on, why? Because
they have cut the trees.

105
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:37,924
So, why do they want to cut the trees?
Because they want to make money, that’s all.

106
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:43,929
Their wood is coming to India, because in
India also they have cut the trees.

107
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:48,335
If you go on like this – mad, you will have
pollution, means what?

108
00:10:48,536 --> 00:10:54,206
Is that, destructive forces will act
and stop it.

109
00:10:56,003 --> 00:10:59,975
For that you don’t have to pray to
the Goddess, it will work out.

110
00:11:00,152 --> 00:11:02,887
And it’s all working out everywhere.

111
00:11:03,088 --> 00:11:08,396
So, whatever you have to have, try to have
something which is handmade.

112
00:11:08,597 --> 00:11:15,664
Even your clothes - need not be many,
try to have it which are handmade -

113
00:11:17,097 --> 00:11:20,406
is one of the things Sahaja Yogis can do.

114
00:11:20,607 --> 00:11:26,295
There need not be to send money to this
Swiss Bank also.

115
00:11:26,456 --> 00:11:29,047
This Swiss Bank will be very badly exposed
now,

116
00:11:29,224 --> 00:11:33,002
I’m angry with them for one more thing,
that they had promised that they’ll give

117
00:11:33,203 --> 00:11:37,729
the money to the Jews and now they are
going like this, they don’t want to give.

118
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:42,630
When they will die are they going
to take it with them?

119
00:11:45,978 --> 00:11:50,843
All these sins will be punished and that is
why I’m very happy

120
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,894
this he has brought in, because I’ve been
talking about it –

121
00:11:54,095 --> 00:11:59,909
even in that conference I went to in China,
I talked openly about this Swiss Bank.

122
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:06,518
I have talked to many magistrates and
to many, what you call them,

123
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:11,238
the head of the law ministry and all that,
and I’ve told them,

124
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:18,298
“Why not we have a conference and say
that this banking is nonsense”.

125
00:12:18,499 --> 00:12:28,621
Now, all types of bad people are taking
advantage of this system

126
00:12:28,822 --> 00:12:34,333
and are trying to make money, look very
nice or so, I don’t know.

127
00:12:34,534 --> 00:12:36,880
So many have lost their money there,

128
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:39,612
I don’t know what was the need to put
all this money there.

129
00:12:39,813 --> 00:12:44,033
That when they die, their children do not
get anything.

130
00:12:44,234 --> 00:12:53,078
But the problem is this greed, is some sort
of a inner defect in a human being.

131
00:12:53,975 --> 00:13:04,987
He becomes greedy, greedy because he has
deviated from dharma.

132
00:13:06,747 --> 00:13:12,415
He thinks he can get pleasure out
of things, he cannot.

133
00:13:12,756 --> 00:13:18,038
And he goes on accumulating and buying
and this and that.

134
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:25,301
I would say your Mother also does that.
I buy, but I buy things which are handmade.

135
00:13:25,507 --> 00:13:31,521
So that tomorrow, if I have to give it
presents, or if I have to sell off things,

136
00:13:31,722 --> 00:13:36,807
even the ornaments you have given Me,
I didn’t know what to do, I’m selling them.

137
00:13:37,008 --> 00:13:46,393
What will I do with the ornaments – I have
to buy so many ashrams, this, that.

138
00:13:46,594 --> 00:13:49,544
My family ornaments also I’m selling,

139
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:54,138
because I spent money on My family things
also.

140
00:13:54,339 --> 00:14:01,350
Just think of it, what is all this for,
what pleasure does it give us?

141
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:05,435
I can understand, if you want to give
somebody a present,

142
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:12,269
or somebody you want to give some
happiness, joy – you should do it,

143
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:19,588
but just for yourself go on, go on, how
much can you digest it? You cannot.

144
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:23,416
Joy is much more in giving to others.

145
00:14:23,617 --> 00:14:31,905
It’s not, it’s not a thing that gives you
any understanding of the fundamentals,

146
00:14:32,106 --> 00:14:37,821
and the fundamentals is that you are
dharma.

147
00:14:38,022 --> 00:14:45,789
Within you is that, that is your valency,
and this materialism absolutely against it,

148
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:58,437
because it creates all kinds of people:
mafias, this Swiss bank, cheats -

149
00:14:58,638 --> 00:15:03,460
we have communities after communities
who are known to be cheats,

150
00:15:03,661 --> 00:15:07,869
who are very materialistic, they have
no spiritual sense.

151
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:12,653
So for Sahaja Yogis, I would say -
of course you have said all the mantras

152
00:15:12,854 --> 00:15:16,759
so I’m supposed to do all that.
But what you have to do

153
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:22,315
is not to buy any more anything which is
not handmade. Try it.

154
00:15:22,516 --> 00:15:24,916
At least, there should be some embroidery,

155
00:15:25,117 --> 00:15:29,521
at least, there should be some work
done on it.

156
00:15:29,727 --> 00:15:34,119
I’m surprised that these things are
not very good for us,

157
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,080
they are injurious to our health.

158
00:15:37,281 --> 00:15:42,420
So Sahaja Yogis must learn that they
have to walk.

159
00:15:42,621 --> 00:15:47,428
They must walk and they must see
the nature, what is in the nature.

160
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:53,174
Many of you don’t know what - say, I ask
the name of this flower,

161
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,558
how many of you know?

162
00:16:01,146 --> 00:16:09,461
It’s a very sweet name, “Kiss Me Quick”,
apart from its botanical name.

163
00:16:09,662 --> 00:16:13,751
But it is, you see, what I’m saying,
everything you should know -

164
00:16:13,952 --> 00:16:20,831
you should know about small, small things,
from where do this embroidery comes?

165
00:16:21,032 --> 00:16:24,115
From where does this sari comes?

166
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:30,097
Our Indian men are the worst, I would say,
they don’t know anything whatsoever.

167
00:16:30,298 --> 00:16:34,364
But even western men also have the same
problem.

168
00:16:34,565 --> 00:16:38,623
You must take interest in things in which
you have not taken interest.

169
00:16:38,819 --> 00:16:43,100
For example, Indians don’t know how
to cook, they don’t know!

170
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:46,547
Once My husband told Me that he knows
how to cook.

171
00:16:46,748 --> 00:16:50,922
I said, “What? He said, “I’ll make
chapatis, rotis.”

172
00:16:51,123 --> 00:16:57,318
And what he made was nothing –
Australia, America, this, that.

173
00:16:58,982 --> 00:17:05,067
But he said, “I give up because I was doing
shipping, but shipping means shipping.”

174
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:14,254
But minute things you can see, what we
call is a subtle vision, subtle eyesight.

175
00:17:14,455 --> 00:17:20,377
If you walk, look at the nature, love
the trees, love the animals.

176
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:24,303
You’ll be amazed, there are so many
things to be known

177
00:17:24,504 --> 00:17:28,234
than reading newspaper, what is there
to read in the newspaper?

178
00:17:28,435 --> 00:17:33,690
For hours together you go on reading
newspaper, next day you forget it.

179
00:17:33,891 --> 00:17:41,158
You’ll be amazed that they say that
for Goddess it is said that

180
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:48,069
“Kataksha Kataksha Nirikshana” – every
glance, She knows everything.

181
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:55,137
Any glance She puts on any man, woman
or anything, She knows where it is.

182
00:17:55,338 --> 00:17:58,409
And if you are My children you should
also try that,

183
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:02,421
because I always used to run out
into jungles, in the forest,

184
00:18:02,622 --> 00:18:09,139
I used to go to all such places and really
enjoy the beautiful Mother,

185
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:14,367
this Mother Earth who has created such
a beautiful thing.

186
00:18:14,568 --> 00:18:19,711
Have you noticed just now that the colors
of the background

187
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:26,745
which were made by the Russians and
the colors of this facing thing

188
00:18:26,946 --> 00:18:33,227
are just the same, they have used the same
colors. It’s true collectivity.

189
00:18:33,428 --> 00:18:38,735
Now, you notice in the nature it’s so
matching, you know.

190
00:18:38,936 --> 00:18:41,614
Nothing gross, nothing loud – it’s
so beautiful,

191
00:18:41,815 --> 00:18:45,877
this is red but it has green to match it.

192
00:18:46,078 --> 00:18:49,576
This Mother Earth knows everything,
She understands everything,

193
00:18:49,777 --> 00:18:54,807
She does everything, but what do we do
for Mother Earth? –

194
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:59,395
Is to run after artificial things,
machinery, this thing –

195
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:03,382
and now a new thing has come, is computer.

196
00:19:04,826 --> 00:19:07,093
It’s all right if you want to write letters
to someone,

197
00:19:07,294 --> 00:19:10,307
but otherwise it’s quite maddening,
you know.

198
00:19:10,508 --> 00:19:14,426
And this computer will make our brain
absolutely zero.

199
00:19:14,627 --> 00:19:18,737
We’ll be paralyzed, we won’t be able
to think 2 + 2.

200
00:19:18,938 --> 00:19:24,098
So, anything that you want to use also,
should have its maryadas,

201
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:27,917
don’t go beyond it. If you take
to swimming,

202
00:19:28,118 --> 00:19:31,394
you’ll go on swimming till you get sick.

203
00:19:31,608 --> 00:19:36,958
If you are horse-riding, you’ll go on
horse-riding till you fall down.

204
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:43,821
You see, this is also a kind of a life
which has no maryadas –

205
00:19:44,022 --> 00:19:50,955
like greed has no maryadas, that’s how
also this kind of nonsense,

206
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:54,559
“I am only fond of this, I am only
fond of this.”

207
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,176
You are a human being, you should never
say like that.

208
00:19:58,377 --> 00:20:02,445
On the contrary you should say, “I must
learn this, I must know this,

209
00:20:02,646 --> 00:20:06,827
what is this all about?”. It is very
important,

210
00:20:07,028 --> 00:20:12,146
otherwise your personality will be a dwarf
personality –

211
00:20:12,347 --> 00:20:17,570
and ultimately people end up in money.
I don’t understand.

212
00:20:17,771 --> 00:20:21,816
I can’t even count 200 notes, can’t even.

213
00:20:22,017 --> 00:20:25,775
I don’t know about money, I should say.
But I’m good at mathematics -

214
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:29,789
but I don’t know, whatever money you are
giving goes direct to them

215
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,768
and they do it what they like. Now,
if somebody says,

216
00:20:32,969 --> 00:20:35,844
“How much You got for this?”
“I don’t know”.

217
00:20:36,045 --> 00:20:42,189
“How much for royalties?” “I don’t know”,
because I’m not interested.

218
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:46,870
I’m not interested. What is there to be
so much interested in money?

219
00:20:47,071 --> 00:20:52,988
But I get money, all right, no problem,
never a problem.

220
00:20:53,189 --> 00:20:56,006
I sold one of My ornaments

221
00:20:56,207 --> 00:21:00,902
and I got at least 100 times more
than what I have spent.

222
00:21:01,102 --> 00:21:05,411
Maybe you might say it’s vibrations,
whatever you may say.

223
00:21:05,612 --> 00:21:16,356
So to get after money means you get
very much in the clutches of money.

224
00:21:16,983 --> 00:21:22,466
So what is the solution, to get rid
of this greed?

225
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:28,122
Is to try and give it to others and see
the joy.

226
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:37,545
Give something to others, share and see
the joy you feel by giving something.

227
00:21:39,852 --> 00:21:43,066
I must tell you, Gregoire is not her
 but I am missing him

228
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:48,571
because once I went to a sari shop
and wanted to buy one sari

229
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:51,251
but I thought “It’s rather expensive,

230
00:21:51,452 --> 00:21:57,075
why should I buy such an expensive sari”,
came away.

231
00:21:57,276 --> 00:22:03,253
And you’ll be amazed, he gave Me the same
sari on My birthday

232
00:22:03,454 --> 00:22:07,965
and I was so filled with joy, because
he bought it next day,

233
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:14,417
went and bought it from that shop, kept it
with him and on My birthday he gave Me.

234
00:22:16,818 --> 00:22:20,490
These small, small things can give you
great joy

235
00:22:20,691 --> 00:22:26,571
in giving people, other people,
not yourself.

236
00:22:26,772 --> 00:22:31,354
I don’t know if I have bought anything
much for Myself in My lifetime, never.

237
00:22:31,555 --> 00:22:33,836
Even if I go out shopping, even if
I am thirsty,

238
00:22:34,037 --> 00:22:38,154
I won’t even buy one Coca-Cola for Myself.

239
00:22:38,355 --> 00:22:42,497
People know that I don’t buy anything
for Myself,

240
00:22:42,698 --> 00:22:45,972
practically nothing, but you all give Me
so much, what to do.

241
00:22:46,173 --> 00:22:53,356
Now, I have decided that after these
75 years of age,

242
00:22:53,557 --> 00:22:57,286
I shouldn’t take anything from you
whatsoever.

243
00:22:57,487 --> 00:23:00,190
But to please you maybe, they are asking
that,

244
00:23:00,391 --> 00:23:05,062
“Only take a national, international”,
all right. But no more,

245
00:23:05,263 --> 00:23:09,992
every country shouldn’t bring. What
after all this national, international –

246
00:23:10,193 --> 00:23:15,545
you are all international people, what is
the need to bring any present for Me?

247
00:23:15,746 --> 00:23:19,907
I don’t even have time to see them.

248
00:23:20,814 --> 00:23:27,463
I’m so very busy with other things, because
there are so many problems in this world.

249
00:23:27,685 --> 00:23:31,390
So, I would suggest that, to get over
all these things

250
00:23:31,591 --> 00:23:35,572
we should see ourselves, what we are
doing about it.

251
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:40,158
I’m sure none of you have money
in the Swiss Bank, thank God.

252
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:46,460
But never earn more than what you can –
you have, there’s no need.

253
00:23:46,661 --> 00:23:51,334
Whatever comes your way is all right.
Of course if you are doing some work

254
00:23:51,535 --> 00:23:58,733
of creativity, of creating some designs,
creating something is all right.

255
00:23:59,624 --> 00:24:03,381
But don’t buy things, go on buying things
for yourself

256
00:24:03,582 --> 00:24:11,525
or putting then money here, hiding, hiding
there, there’s no need.

257
00:24:11,915 --> 00:24:17,428
You see, you’ll feel so satisfied and
so happy being honest,

258
00:24:17,629 --> 00:24:25,293
being absolutely beyond any problem.

259
00:24:25,596 --> 00:24:31,179
Now this mafia business is there, I agree
with you. Now this mafia can be controlled

260
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:37,186
only by the government because they give
such a big tax.

261
00:24:37,387 --> 00:24:41,094
Now I mean, for example, an artisan
in this poor country -

262
00:24:41,295 --> 00:24:46,016
I will say poor because most of the people
are suffering from tax –

263
00:24:46,217 --> 00:24:52,472
you see, he has to pay 265 types of taxes.

264
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:58,417
Italians are known for their art, they make
beautiful things,

265
00:24:58,618 --> 00:25:02,820
but they cannot because they have to pay
so much taxation.

266
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:06,159
Only the designers they make the money.

267
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:11,223
Designers make the money befooling
everybody.

268
00:25:12,774 --> 00:25:20,646
They befool people so much. Once My husband
went to Cairo and bought one scarf for Me.

269
00:25:21,894 --> 00:25:24,500
So, he said, “This is designer’s.”

270
00:25:24,701 --> 00:25:29,794
I said, “This looks Indian to me, this is
an Indian thing.”

271
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:35,225
And surprisingly in the corner it was
written “Made in India”.

272
00:25:36,305 --> 00:25:43,321
He paid £25 for that, in India you can
get it for £2.

273
00:25:44,768 --> 00:25:48,779
So, this is another thing is to run a race
of eliteness.

274
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,971
You see this one was bought by
My son-in-law.

275
00:25:53,172 --> 00:25:58,162
I said: “What is so special?”
He said, “It’s very great, you know.”

276
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:02,132
I didn’t know what was so special about
those spectacles.

277
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:08,557
So, I went to one shop in America

278
00:26:08,758 --> 00:26:11,742
and they all started saying, “Madam,
Madam, Madam …”.

279
00:26:11,943 --> 00:26:16,520
I said, “What is so Madam about Me?.
Why are they calling Me ‘Madam’?”

280
00:26:16,721 --> 00:26:23,257
“Oh, You don’t know?” - they said - “This
is Cartier.” I said, “Who is this Cartier?”

281
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:27,971
So I’m going to put Kartikeya against him!

282
00:26:30,133 --> 00:26:38,128
All such stupid ideas, you see, and then
they bought Me a…

283
00:26:38,329 --> 00:26:46,837
[Aside: “What you call that? The watch was…
what was that watch? Ah, Patek Philippe!] -

284
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:51,695
Patek Philippe, that watch they brought
for Me

285
00:26:51,896 --> 00:26:56,525
and it would not run in time. I said,
“What is this?

286
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:01,580
Never keeps the time, it’s always
out of time.

287
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:05,312
My vibrations must be trying some tricks”.

288
00:27:05,513 --> 00:27:09,278
So I gave it to one of them, I said, “Baba,
show this to the Patek Phillips.”

289
00:27:09,564 --> 00:27:13,559
Ah, that day Mathias was here. “This
will hit their ego, Mother, very much”.

290
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,705
I said, “Why?” “Because they think
they are the best.”

291
00:27:18,372 --> 00:27:22,534
I said, “Whatever it is, tell them you
change it, it doesn’t keep to time.”

292
00:27:22,735 --> 00:27:26,255
Then I asked My daughter to have it,
I said, “Baba, I can’t make …

293
00:27:26,456 --> 00:27:30,821
I don’t know why, maybe I will have
something simple, it’s better.”

294
00:27:31,022 --> 00:27:37,185
That too again turned out to be a,
what you call? ‘Designers’.

295
00:27:37,386 --> 00:27:42,056
They are now all - most of these designers
are in jail.

296
00:27:42,257 --> 00:27:47,329
And some of them met Me when I was
coming from Russia.

297
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:52,017
They are absolutely useless people,
you know.

298
00:27:52,218 --> 00:27:54,938
They take out some idea and sell it
for a high price

299
00:27:55,147 --> 00:28:03,801
and if you are a fool you go and buy that.
Did you notice that this is Cartier?

300
00:28:06,234 --> 00:28:12,032
For Sahaja Yogis are simple people. Now
this is the thing is that there are,

301
00:28:12,256 --> 00:28:15,490
these are also mafias, I tell you, these
are also mafias.

302
00:28:15,691 --> 00:28:19,636
And these mafias are exploiting you,
I’ve written it in My book also,

303
00:28:19,837 --> 00:28:24,250
if you read it, how these entrepreneurs
are trying to befool you.

304
00:28:24,451 --> 00:28:31,289
You wear simple dress, simple from
handmade – will be much better

305
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:37,719
than to wear something that makes you
look like something out of the blue.

306
00:28:38,485 --> 00:28:43,890
And there is no need because it is just
satisfying your ego.

307
00:28:44,091 --> 00:28:53,645
Some people have a habit – as soon as –
say, I have, supposing some dinner set,

308
00:28:53,846 --> 00:28:58,411
may not be good or… - they’ll come and see
the back of the dinner plate.

309
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:03,325
“Ah, from where did You get it?” –
“I don’t know.” “You don’t know?”

310
00:29:03,526 --> 00:29:07,497
“No, no, this was, I think, I think somebody
gave Me, I don’t know, I don’t know.”

311
00:29:07,711 --> 00:29:10,454
“No, no, You better find out, because
very nice.”

312
00:29:10,622 --> 00:29:13,743
Next day they’ll go round the whole place
to find out

313
00:29:13,944 --> 00:29:17,724
if they can get the same dinner set.

314
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:22,347
And Sahaja Yoga is just the opposite.
I tell you, you depend on Sahaja Yoga.

315
00:29:22,548 --> 00:29:32,109
Once My husband liked one tea set. So
you know London has huge, big stores.

316
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:36,161
Some of them are really horrid.
I went there –

317
00:29:36,362 --> 00:29:40,397
baarpre baap - we walked and walked
and walked through so many.

318
00:29:40,598 --> 00:29:44,383
They said, “All right, we promise after
6 months.” Another said, “7 months”,

319
00:29:44,584 --> 00:29:51,979
another said, “8 months, you give us
the order.” So I gave up the idea.

320
00:29:52,267 --> 00:29:54,968
Then C.P. said, “What has happened
to their factories?”

321
00:29:55,198 --> 00:29:58,001
I said, “They don’t have anything, they
are exporting.”

322
00:29:58,202 --> 00:30:05,165
Then I went to Australia, you’ll be amazed
- and there for a special price,

323
00:30:05,366 --> 00:30:11,287
just for propagating, they had put
these tea sets there.

324
00:30:12,009 --> 00:30:17,555
Imagine, in Australia, and I got it
for the half price.

325
00:30:18,172 --> 00:30:24,276
So, if you don’t have greed you get
what you want just there.

326
00:30:26,603 --> 00:30:29,964
Just there you get it.

327
00:30:30,918 --> 00:30:36,398
But if you have greed, then God makes
you dance. All right?

328
00:30:36,608 --> 00:30:41,080
That is what is so simple as that -
whatever you want you can get it,

329
00:30:41,281 --> 00:30:44,797
if you don’t have greed about it.

330
00:30:45,004 --> 00:30:50,786
That’s such an enslaving thing within us,
that we have greed.

331
00:30:50,987 --> 00:30:57,492
I mean I can give you 1,001 examples
of that, 1,001.

332
00:30:57,693 --> 00:31:03,650
That if you don’t ask for anything, if you
don’t desire for anything,

333
00:31:03,851 --> 00:31:09,944
you get what you need, whatever you need
you get.

334
00:31:10,603 --> 00:31:17,858
But if you go on desiring, then go mad
after it. Go there, get this and get lost.

335
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:21,699
And then the thing also gets lost.

336
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:29,147
That’s why it is said, better try
to develop a detachment.

337
00:31:29,485 --> 00:31:34,510
It’s all right, if it is there well and
good, if it is not there, doesn’t matter.

338
00:31:35,763 --> 00:31:39,474
Then you’ll be surprised your attention
will be so subtle.

339
00:31:39,675 --> 00:31:45,647
Now none of you I think have seen these
beautiful flowers, what are there.

340
00:31:45,848 --> 00:31:51,447
The beautiful embroidery that is there.
The way they have done this.

341
00:31:51,648 --> 00:31:56,747
Now can you tell Me how many there are,
hands in this work –

342
00:31:59,228 --> 00:32:08,594
14, 28. This side 14, this side 14.

343
00:32:14,656 --> 00:32:20,319
I mean, inclusive of all these other
things.

344
00:32:21,784 --> 00:32:27,636
So you don’t notice anything and your
attention becomes…

345
00:32:27,837 --> 00:32:32,457
“Mahamaya” - they say has been - “it has
been the Mahamaya”. This is no explanation.

346
00:32:32,658 --> 00:32:39,460
Your attention if it is clear, is simple,
you can see the thing clearly.

347
00:32:41,102 --> 00:32:46,427
And with that attention only, that
attention yourself

348
00:32:47,311 --> 00:32:49,900
takes you to the right place where you
have to go,

349
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:53,999
you get the right thing what you want
to buy.

350
00:32:57,305 --> 00:33:01,800
Can you tell Me you see these carpets
are from where?

351
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,326
They are mostly from Russia.

352
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:21,779
I went to Russia and I saw this carpet
factory. They have no sense of export also.

353
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:27,024
So I told them that, “How much will
a carpet cost?” - Doctor knows -

354
00:33:27,225 --> 00:33:32,648
They said, “Only $20.” I said, “Baba,
$20 for a carpet?”

355
00:33:32,849 --> 00:33:36,732
So, I told Doctor, “Now what to do,
we have to buy many”.

356
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:42,081
I said, “How much for export?” “$200.”

357
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:46,787
I said, “In India the other way round.
If you have to export something,

358
00:33:46,988 --> 00:33:52,303
then the price is less.” I said,
“All right,

359
00:33:52,504 --> 00:33:56,438
so I guess we must think of the solution
because I need it.”

360
00:33:56,639 --> 00:34:00,876
So I asked about 20 Sahaja Yogis to go
and buy each one.

361
00:34:01,084 --> 00:34:06,319
To Russians they give for $20.
I said, “All right, you bring these.”

362
00:34:07,495 --> 00:34:13,647
So, you should go in for solutions and not
for problems.

363
00:34:13,848 --> 00:34:18,881
Greed is a problem, greed is a problem.

364
00:34:19,082 --> 00:34:21,978
How to get rid of the greed is the point.

365
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:25,828
And to get rid of the greed is that
if I buy something –

366
00:34:26,029 --> 00:34:31,338
for whom should I buy this one, for whom
should I buy?

367
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:37,149
Ah, this will be all right for another
friend of mine, like that.

368
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:44,155
If you train your mind on these lines,
not for yourself, but for others,

369
00:34:44,356 --> 00:34:50,360
then you’ll be amazed this greed will run
away and you’ll have joy.

370
00:34:51,154 --> 00:34:55,747
As you want to give Me things, I understand
that, I also want to give you.

371
00:34:55,948 --> 00:35:01,761
In the same way, think of all others,
they are all brothers and sisters.

372
00:35:02,653 --> 00:35:07,013
From other countries, make friends
with other countries.

373
00:35:07,214 --> 00:35:11,184
If giving is there, then this greed goes
away (indistinct)

374
00:35:11,385 --> 00:35:17,038
and you get what you want. It’s a very
simple mantra.

375
00:35:18,775 --> 00:35:28,614
It’s surprising, so far, with all
the miracles,

376
00:35:28,815 --> 00:35:33,700
we don’t understand that whatever
we need also be provided for.

377
00:35:33,901 --> 00:35:40,999
But you must need it, not for stupid
collection of things.

378
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:47,657
This was a very, very good thing, acted
very well, I enjoyed it thoroughly,

379
00:35:47,858 --> 00:35:53,888
this Swiss Bank laundering. I know
My country suffers from it.

380
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:59,580
Now, the another drama, which was done
by the English,

381
00:35:59,781 --> 00:36:05,786
shows – it’s a – “Pilgrim’s Progress” is
an old, quite an old drama,

382
00:36:05,987 --> 00:36:11,123
which I have read long time back. But this
is the real pilgrims they have shown,

383
00:36:11,324 --> 00:36:16,012
how a seeker goes into wrong ways, methods,

384
00:36:16,213 --> 00:36:20,650
and throughout they have very nicely
brought in how even a Sahaja Yogi,

385
00:36:20,851 --> 00:36:26,631
while rising, falls into different pits.
So it’s a very good thing for you to know

386
00:36:26,832 --> 00:36:32,245
that if you are Sahaja Yogis, you should be
very careful, and you should see that

387
00:36:32,446 --> 00:36:39,483
you don’t fall into these pits and
ultimately the ego and superego.

388
00:36:40,273 --> 00:36:47,974
In the west the problem is more of ego,
not of superego. And for ego,

389
00:36:52,792 --> 00:37:00,347
to accept that you have ego is the only
way; and then it will drop out.

390
00:37:00,548 --> 00:37:04,882
If you know there is ego, ego will
drop out.

391
00:37:05,827 --> 00:37:10,966
The simple thing is to know that you have
ego. Ego of something.

392
00:37:11,167 --> 00:37:14,415
People have ego of any nonsense, you know.

393
00:37:14,616 --> 00:37:17,795
There was one lady very proud
and egoistical.

394
00:37:17,996 --> 00:37:24,100
So I asked about her, “What is the matter
with her?”

395
00:37:24,301 --> 00:37:27,421
“Because she knows how to make dolls” –
Why?

396
00:37:27,622 --> 00:37:31,254
That should give you ego or what?
I didn’t understand that part.

397
00:37:31,455 --> 00:37:35,201
But this is what it is, even for small
things people have ego,

398
00:37:35,402 --> 00:37:43,450
and all this designing and all that
is based on your stupid ego

399
00:37:43,651 --> 00:37:48,058
which makes you buy all these things
to show off your ego.

400
00:37:48,259 --> 00:37:55,720
So try to be humble – humble and try
to understand

401
00:37:55,921 --> 00:38:00,877
that all these worldly things we are not
going to take them with us.

402
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:03,764
They are going to lie down here. I am not
saying you renounce.

403
00:38:03,978 --> 00:38:07,910
I’m not saying you take sanyasa, but you
should know that

404
00:38:08,111 --> 00:38:11,918
the value of these things is nothing
compared to you.

405
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:14,584
When ego comes, this idiocity comes in.

406
00:38:14,785 --> 00:38:21,269
You think by wearing something great
you are very much influencing others.

407
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:28,603
You may, but those who are influenced
are another set of fools, I must say.

408
00:38:28,804 --> 00:38:35,806
Once I was wearing a ring and I went
to shopping in one of the places

409
00:38:36,007 --> 00:38:39,432
and they were so respectful to Me.
I said, “Suddenly the shopkeepers,

410
00:38:39,633 --> 00:38:44,423
they never respect Me because I’m
an Indian – what has happened?”

411
00:38:44,585 --> 00:38:48,673
So I had gone to a shop where the lady
was known to Me.

412
00:38:48,874 --> 00:38:54,702
She said, “May I ask You, is this real?”
I said, “What do you mean, real?”

413
00:38:54,903 --> 00:39:00,358
“Is it a real emerald?” “Yes, yes, very old
from My family.”

414
00:39:00,583 --> 00:39:04,287
“Ah, so Your family very rich?”

415
00:39:04,488 --> 00:39:10,622
“No, no, it was from My forefathers,
I’m just wearing that.”

416
00:39:10,823 --> 00:39:15,878
“Oh my God, if it is real, what will be
the price?” I said, “How will I know,

417
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,368
it was bought long time back, I don’t know
the price.” “No, can you get me one?”

418
00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:24,813
I said, “Why do you want to have it,
you can have this one if you like.”

419
00:39:25,014 --> 00:39:32,472
Like that, you know, a small thing makes
them so…, that you are so great. It’s not.

420
00:39:32,673 --> 00:39:36,443
What is the greatest thing in us is
our Spirit,

421
00:39:36,644 --> 00:39:41,357
is the Spirit that we have and we should
know that we should be proud of it,

422
00:39:41,558 --> 00:39:44,301
that we have got the Spirit within us.

423
00:39:44,502 --> 00:39:50,032
And if you become proud, then you will not
do nonsensical things.

424
00:39:50,233 --> 00:39:53,723
You are people who are all realized souls.

425
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:58,793
And already, you have crossed over this
pilgrims stage, you are much above that.

426
00:39:58,994 --> 00:40:03,365
Now the greatest thing is to know that
we are spiritual people

427
00:40:03,566 --> 00:40:11,182
and as spiritual people – you even
dominate Me, in a way.

428
00:40:11,383 --> 00:40:15,289
If you all desire for something, I can’t
get over it.

429
00:40:15,489 --> 00:40:22,480
I have to accept. I have to keep you
pleased.

430
00:40:22,681 --> 00:40:27,344
Many things I’m doing just because
you want it;

431
00:40:27,545 --> 00:40:32,628
doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter to Me
because nothing comes over My head.

432
00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:36,033
So it’s all right, whatever children want,
let them do.

433
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:43,271
But the one point is this ego has to be
really under control.

434
00:40:44,277 --> 00:40:47,882
There’s one little more point I want
to tell you,

435
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:50,123
because tomorrow I may not be able to say,

436
00:40:50,324 --> 00:40:54,814
in Navaratri, you see, I am bound by other
things, is this –

437
00:40:55,015 --> 00:41:01,162
I wanted to talk to people who are married
in Sahaja Yoga, especially to the ladies.

438
00:41:01,363 --> 00:41:08,372
I think some of them are extremely
dominating and stupid.

439
00:41:08,705 --> 00:41:14,884
What is marriage? Marriage is honeymoon
as they call it.

440
00:41:15,085 --> 00:41:20,080
Honey is the essence and moon is the peace.

441
00:41:20,281 --> 00:41:26,413
Now if the women are quarrelsome,
fighting, sarcastic,

442
00:41:26,614 --> 00:41:31,043
it is absolutely a hell for man.

443
00:41:32,369 --> 00:41:38,290
Instead of that, if woman knows
the essence, the honey,

444
00:41:38,491 --> 00:41:44,480
she should know how to please the husband,
to bring peace in the family.

445
00:41:44,681 --> 00:41:49,552
Now some of the husbands are drunkards
or anything – not in Sahaja Yoga.

446
00:41:49,697 --> 00:41:53,038
What pleases the husband?

447
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:57,937
You see, in a way, it’s a trick.

448
00:41:58,138 --> 00:42:03,832
It’s a trick of a realized soul, how
to please others.

449
00:42:04,033 --> 00:42:08,896
What do we do to our husbands?
Do we try to please?

450
00:42:09,097 --> 00:42:12,757
First of all find out what he likes.

451
00:42:14,485 --> 00:42:17,452
My husband, I would say - he’s gone away,
thank God -

452
00:42:17,653 --> 00:42:20,518
he used to say, “You shouldn’t wear
any flower in your head.”

453
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:25,261
But in Maharashtra all the married women
are supposed to wear flowers.

454
00:42:25,462 --> 00:42:30,957
Since that day I have never worn any flower
in My head.

455
00:42:31,158 --> 00:42:36,829
It’s all right, doesn’t matter, he didn’t
know what I was,

456
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:40,385
so he said, “Don’t wear any flowers,
I don’t like.” Then he said,

457
00:42:40,586 --> 00:42:44,014
“You must wear bangles” because he comes
from a very traditional family.

458
00:42:44,215 --> 00:42:51,097
All My life I have worn bangles. It pleases
him, what’s the matter?

459
00:42:51,298 --> 00:42:54,787
Little, little things you do just to please
him,

460
00:42:54,964 --> 00:42:59,075
then he also starts thinking, “See, what
should I do for My wife?”.

461
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:03,850
But first it must start from woman,
not from man,

462
00:43:04,051 --> 00:43:07,483
because women are responsible
for the society.

463
00:43:07,684 --> 00:43:13,962
In the western culture they had not told
what is their job is.

464
00:43:14,163 --> 00:43:18,778
Man’s job is economics, politics,
money earning.

465
00:43:18,979 --> 00:43:24,454
They have made a mess out of it, I agree
with you. It’s quite a big mess.

466
00:43:24,655 --> 00:43:29,074
But your job is to make the society.

467
00:43:29,275 --> 00:43:33,834
And to make the society, first you must
know how to keep children pleased,

468
00:43:34,035 --> 00:43:38,418
how to keep your husband pleased, how
to help and be close to them (Unclear).

469
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:44,051
On the contrary, if you try all the time
to dominate,

470
00:43:44,252 --> 00:43:46,855
that’s not your job to dominate at all.

471
00:43:47,056 --> 00:43:55,915
Your job is to make neutralize his
domination by simple, simple things.

472
00:43:56,772 --> 00:44:02,468
I’ll give you an example. Thank God
he is not here!

473
00:44:04,178 --> 00:44:10,577
He knows, he knows I’m very, I am very
clever in certain things.

474
00:44:10,778 --> 00:44:16,365
In his office he had a gentleman. I never
used to interfere with his office.

475
00:44:16,566 --> 00:44:19,541
But there was one gentleman, good one,

476
00:44:19,742 --> 00:44:23,712
who gave up his organization and joined
another one

477
00:44:23,913 --> 00:44:27,763
because it was a private one, he was
getting more money, so he joined that.

478
00:44:27,964 --> 00:44:34,859
But there he found it was horrible, so he
wanted to come back to Shipping Corporation.

479
00:44:35,633 --> 00:44:38,596
But My husband is very particular about
rules and regulations.

480
00:44:38,797 --> 00:44:41,621
He said, “No, no, no, now I won’t have you,
I don’t want to see your face, get out”,

481
00:44:41,822 --> 00:44:48,649
this thing, that (thing). So he came to Me.
Normally, I never interfere.

482
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:53,047
He came to Me and he said, “If You tell
him he might listen.”

483
00:44:53,248 --> 00:44:58,621
I said, “No, if I tell him he will never
listen. But I know how to do it.”

484
00:44:58,822 --> 00:45:03,328
So I told him that this gentleman came
to see Me.

485
00:45:03,529 --> 00:45:08,127
“Ha, so he’s come to the right person, now
are you going to trouble me about it?”

486
00:45:08,328 --> 00:45:13,081
I said, “No, no, no, not Me, but just think
why he came to Me.”

487
00:45:13,282 --> 00:45:17,207
He said, “Why?” “Because he thinks I’m more
generous than you are.”

488
00:45:17,408 --> 00:45:21,273
Immediately this competition.

489
00:45:26,708 --> 00:45:29,809
And that fellow got the job, he was
a great friend of his,

490
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:32,975
even in London he was helping him a lot.

491
00:45:33,176 --> 00:45:39,127
So, when we think that we have to control
our husband,

492
00:45:39,328 --> 00:45:43,829
it’s better to do it in a very simple way.

493
00:45:45,636 --> 00:45:49,532
Only on fundamentals you can put down
your foot.

494
00:45:49,733 --> 00:45:53,213
Otherwise for small, small things,

495
00:45:53,414 --> 00:45:57,997
if you go on dominating your husband
I tell you, you will miss the point.

496
00:45:58,198 --> 00:46:04,630
You have married for stupidity or
for honeymoon?

497
00:46:06,075 --> 00:46:10,852
And in the West, especially in Italy, we
have had very bad experiences of women.

498
00:46:11,053 --> 00:46:15,794
English also, I must say. English girls
also have given Me lot of trouble.

499
00:46:15,995 --> 00:46:21,535
I mean, they are banned now, because
I can’t help it.

500
00:46:21,736 --> 00:46:27,371
One girl from Sri Lanka she was married
to somebody in…

501
00:46:27,572 --> 00:46:29,943
 [Aside, maybe to a child: “Sit down,
sit down”] -

502
00:46:30,144 --> 00:46:34,719
she was married to somebody in USA.

503
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:42,274
Imagine from that horrible Sri Lanka where
there’s everyday at least 30 murders,

504
00:46:42,475 --> 00:46:45,952
she got such a good chance to go to USA.

505
00:46:46,153 --> 00:46:53,218
Of course, USA’s also not a very great
place - but she started behaving

506
00:46:53,419 --> 00:46:59,750
as if she is a childish person and talking
to him in such a manner.

507
00:46:59,951 --> 00:47:05,390
He told Me “Mother, she is a sadist.
Whenever I telephone to her she talks to me

508
00:47:05,591 --> 00:47:10,976
in such a sarcastic manner and this
and that, that I’m surprised.”

509
00:47:11,177 --> 00:47:14,888
I said, “A lady from Sri Lanka? I can’t
believe it!”

510
00:47:15,089 --> 00:47:20,163
Then he told Me what she talked to him and
how she talked to him. I was amazed.

511
00:47:20,364 --> 00:47:23,930
I mean, no man would be happy to hear
all these things.

512
00:47:24,114 --> 00:47:30,648
But she thought she was very friendly, and
she was joking or something like that.

513
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:34,788
This doesn’t work out in marriage.

514
00:47:35,721 --> 00:47:45,354
Man doesn’t want a wife to be on the horse
and beating with a whip.

515
00:47:45,555 --> 00:47:48,483
Why has he married?

516
00:47:48,684 --> 00:47:55,669
For the happiness, for the joy, for
the sweetness of a woman.

517
00:47:59,268 --> 00:48:01,660
 It’s a very important thing I wanted
to talk

518
00:48:01,861 --> 00:48:06,829
because so many of women are thinking
that they are something great.

519
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:10,280
Some of them have some money, some of them
have some jobs,

520
00:48:10,481 --> 00:48:15,392
but first job is to keep the society
very happy

521
00:48:15,593 --> 00:48:19,884
and to keep your husband happy –
is the first job.

522
00:48:20,366 --> 00:48:25,910
If a woman cannot keep the husband happy,
she is no good for us.

523
00:48:26,077 --> 00:48:31,148
She is no good Sahaja Yogini. This is
a place, like a man

524
00:48:31,349 --> 00:48:34,493
who is working in the office, he has
to keep his boss pleased.

525
00:48:34,694 --> 00:48:38,627
If he doesn’t please his boss, he is
useless, he’s thrown out of.

526
00:48:38,828 --> 00:48:45,214
In the same way a woman has to think about
the husband, in a very kindly manner,

527
00:48:45,415 --> 00:48:50,838
because this is her job, this is why
she is marrying.

528
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:55,334
Otherwise she should not marry, she can do
what she likes.

529
00:48:56,495 --> 00:49:01,843
It’s a difficult thing to convince anyone

530
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:06,003
because, you see, men are right-sided,
they are hot-tempered.

531
00:49:06,204 --> 00:49:13,537
But I have told you just now how to capture
their anger.

532
00:49:15,676 --> 00:49:19,666
I’ve seen also in the films, you see
all romantic scenes going on –

533
00:49:19,867 --> 00:49:22,539
it never happens, there’s nobody is
like that,

534
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:25,557
you see, it’s all absurd things you see,

535
00:49:25,758 --> 00:49:31,094
so you expect them to be Clark Gable
or somebody, it’s not so.

536
00:49:33,273 --> 00:49:39,262
You have to love, you have to take
your husband into your heart first.

537
00:49:39,463 --> 00:49:44,323
This is your duty, otherwise what else
are you doing?

538
00:49:48,534 --> 00:49:51,672
I was shocked, a girl from Sri Lanka -
and this boy has said,

539
00:49:51,873 --> 00:49:55,620
“Mother, you can kill me, but I will not
have that girl here,

540
00:49:55,821 --> 00:50:00,117
because she is not joy-giving.”
It’s a fact.

541
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:05,551
So if your wife is like that supposing -
now I am telling men.

542
00:50:07,189 --> 00:50:10,582
The trick of the trade is, if your wife
is like that,

543
00:50:10,783 --> 00:50:14,264
try to understand why she does it.

544
00:50:14,465 --> 00:50:19,269
What is her problem, why is she
dominating you?

545
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:25,057
Or you think she is dominating you. Most
of the times, most of the men who talk,

546
00:50:25,258 --> 00:50:30,170
“Oh, wives are like this, wives”… they are
very dominating.

547
00:50:30,371 --> 00:50:35,851
Why is she dominating you, what’s wrong
with you, that she is dominating?

548
00:50:36,052 --> 00:50:42,031
If you introspect, you’ll find that you
give very little time to her.

549
00:50:42,232 --> 00:50:46,484
Now, the other part is, there was one lady,
she wanted to have a divorce.

550
00:50:46,685 --> 00:50:50,643
I said, “Why?” “Because he goes to work
all the time

551
00:50:50,844 --> 00:50:55,298
and he is not there and this and that.”

552
00:50:55,614 --> 00:50:58,955
But I said, “If you divorce, then you will
never be with him.

553
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:04,561
So why do you want to have a divorce?
At least, at least he gives you some time,

554
00:51:04,762 --> 00:51:08,790
but if you divorce, then he’ll never be
with you, so why do you ask for divorce?”

555
00:51:08,991 --> 00:51:11,781
I can’t understand the logic.

556
00:51:11,982 --> 00:51:16,479
I mean women should not be brainless,
isn’t it - to say such a thing.

557
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:22,191
If you want to divorce your husband
for this – it’s absurd.

558
00:51:22,857 --> 00:51:31,461
Now, for men it is important that they
should give some time,

559
00:51:31,662 --> 00:51:37,811
pay some attention and get some things
that they like.

560
00:51:39,418 --> 00:51:42,004
Now, I’ll give you again My own example.

561
00:51:42,205 --> 00:51:47,020
My husband never brought any flowers
for Me, you all bring flowers for Me,

562
00:51:47,221 --> 00:51:52,569
but he never brought any flowers for Me,
whether it was birthday or anything.

563
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:57,314
Then I realized that this man has no sense
of flowers.

564
00:51:57,515 --> 00:52:02,779
He doesn’t know what is a rose or what is
any other flower.

565
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:07,143
And he might bring something which is
horrible, you know.

566
00:52:07,344 --> 00:52:10,599
Maybe (a) cactus he might bring.

567
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:17,253
It’s better he doesn’t bring anything,
because that would be insulting, isn’t it?

568
00:52:17,454 --> 00:52:21,084
And then one day he admitted, “I don’t know
anything about flowers,

569
00:52:21,285 --> 00:52:26,354
now will you tell me – except for roses,
I don’t know anything.”

570
00:52:26,539 --> 00:52:30,323
And you’ll be amazed, even roses, he misses
out (for that? Indistinct).

571
00:52:30,524 --> 00:52:33,131
So, with such an ignorance of things,

572
00:52:33,332 --> 00:52:38,247
if your husband doesn’t do, it shows
consideration.

573
00:52:39,767 --> 00:52:47,104
But men should try to know what a woman
likes, what she wants.

574
00:52:47,305 --> 00:52:51,885
Moreover, men have their own style
of thinking.

575
00:52:52,093 --> 00:53:00,321
Now, to give My own example again,
better (it) is.

576
00:53:00,584 --> 00:53:03,433
He buys always very expensive things.

577
00:53:03,634 --> 00:53:07,869
So, I’ve told him, “Don’t buy anything
for Me.” So, “You don’t like?”

578
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:13,121
“No, no, I like it, but too much of these
too expensive things, why should you buy?”

579
00:53:13,322 --> 00:53:18,704
So, he is very fond of buying these kind
of sweaters from that Scotch House,

580
00:53:18,905 --> 00:53:23,847
very expensive they are, £250 each,
you know.

581
00:53:24,048 --> 00:53:29,152
I don’t know how many I have, how many
in black, how many, you see.

582
00:53:29,353 --> 00:53:35,116
I told him, “I’ll get it from Switzerland,
they are much cheaper there” and all that.

583
00:53:35,317 --> 00:53:39,467
Then another is he wants to buy a cashmere
coat for Me, always.

584
00:53:39,644 --> 00:53:43,286
I must be having at least 10 of them
hanging,

585
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:47,209
but he likes to give that only – all right.

586
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:52,065
So, I’m passing out them to My daughters,
granddaughters and all that.

587
00:53:52,266 --> 00:53:56,219
Then what to do now? You see, men –
he doesn’t mean anything bad,

588
00:53:56,420 --> 00:54:02,040
but because he doesn’t know, doesn’t know.

589
00:54:02,241 --> 00:54:07,073
First thing he did was to, when in India,
before going to the Puja,

590
00:54:07,274 --> 00:54:13,941
he went to buy a sari for Me. The one
of My nephews went with him.

591
00:54:14,142 --> 00:54:20,679
So he says, “Give me the most expensive
sari that you have.”

592
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,813
So these people thought there’s somebody
has come now.

593
00:54:24,014 --> 00:54:28,683
The shopkeepers could understand this
gentleman doesn’t know anything of it.

594
00:54:28,884 --> 00:54:32,458
So they brought out a sari, said,
“This is the most expensive,

595
00:54:32,659 --> 00:54:36,568
the price is 45,000 rupees” – in those
days this was.

596
00:54:36,769 --> 00:54:39,820
“All right, all right, you give me. I have
a card, will you take the card?”

597
00:54:40,021 --> 00:54:43,392
“Yes, yes, we’ll take the card.” He bought
the sari for Me.

598
00:54:43,593 --> 00:54:49,374
It is so heavy, it is so heavy that it was
something…

599
00:54:49,575 --> 00:54:54,746
[Hindi aside]

600
00:54:54,956 --> 00:54:58,186
That… what do you call that, arm.. – you
wear… Some yogis: Armor.

601
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,322
Shri Mataji: Eh? Some yogis: Armor.
Shri Mataji: Very heavy, you know.

602
00:55:02,523 --> 00:55:06,414
I said, “Now what?”
He said, “You must wear for the Puja."

603
00:55:06,615 --> 00:55:10,936
I was walking like a giant, you know.

604
00:55:17,165 --> 00:55:21,488
There’s a description of your Mother is
“Ati saumya Ati raudra” –

605
00:55:21,689 --> 00:55:25,724
She is extremely soft and extremely
terrible.

606
00:55:25,925 --> 00:55:29,001
But, I don’t know with that sari,
how I sat!

607
00:55:29,202 --> 00:55:33,433
I sat in one place glued down into that.

608
00:55:33,634 --> 00:55:38,893
Now to get up I didn’t know how to get up
with that weight on My body. You see?

609
00:55:39,094 --> 00:55:44,605
And then I brought it and put it properly
in a box and this and that.

610
00:55:44,806 --> 00:55:48,193
So he said, “When are you wearing that
next?” “Now,” I said, “Please,

611
00:55:48,394 --> 00:55:52,327
I’ve kept it nicely for one wedding,
I’ll wear sometime.”

612
00:55:52,528 --> 00:55:58,423
I promised him and kept it there, because
he doesn’t understand about saris.

613
00:55:59,177 --> 00:56:01,701
I know he doesn’t understand about saris.

614
00:56:01,866 --> 00:56:06,747
So if he doesn’t understand, whatever
he buys, I say “All right”.

615
00:56:06,948 --> 00:56:09,631
And he spends so much money on those
things, you know,

616
00:56:09,832 --> 00:56:16,160
45,000 rupees for such a sari...
[Hindi words]

617
00:56:16,384 --> 00:56:22,913
So he doesn’t understand what is real,
what is unreal, nothing – doesn’t matter.

618
00:56:23,114 --> 00:56:27,987
You have to just see his heart, how he
is giving you,

619
00:56:28,188 --> 00:56:31,427
with what love he is giving you. He doesn’t
understand.

620
00:56:31,628 --> 00:56:34,725
So what can you do, poor man, you know.

621
00:56:34,925 --> 00:56:40,417
I always buy suit lengths for him or suits
for him, I always – Myself.

622
00:56:40,618 --> 00:56:43,563
Once he said, “All right, I’m going to buy
this time.” I said, “Better buy.”

623
00:56:43,764 --> 00:56:47,251
He bought such a horrible one and he went
to the office

624
00:56:47,452 --> 00:56:52,408
and everybody said, “Sir, this is not
your taste.”

625
00:56:55,404 --> 00:56:57,596
So he threw it away, he said, “I will never
buy now,

626
00:56:57,797 --> 00:57:00,541
can you, better go and buy for myself.”

627
00:57:00,742 --> 00:57:05,857
See, it’s - but the trouble is if women
take interest and know

628
00:57:06,058 --> 00:57:08,757
what sort of color he will like and this
and that.

629
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:14,909
And also public opinion is very important
for men, for example what the public says.

630
00:57:15,110 --> 00:57:19,795
Like once I painted My drawing room
with a very nice color,

631
00:57:19,996 --> 00:57:25,633
pink and black film mixed – very nice.
Because it’s a sign of warmth.

632
00:57:25,819 --> 00:57:27,431
He said, “What is this color you have
put it?

633
00:57:27,632 --> 00:57:30,721
You should have done this and that”,
he started shouting.

634
00:57:30,922 --> 00:57:34,692
I said, “All right, tomorrow we are having
a party, after that I’ll change it.”

635
00:57:34,893 --> 00:57:39,099
Next day the people came in, they said,
“Oh, what a color, what a color,

636
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:43,877
how have you made this color, how did…?”
He started looking at Me.

637
00:57:44,078 --> 00:57:49,008
I said, “Should I remove it?”
“No, no, no, no, no, it’s very nice.”

638
00:57:51,162 --> 00:57:55,437
Men care for public opinion very much
and you should see

639
00:57:55,622 --> 00:58:01,570
that you create a good public opinion
in his presence,

640
00:58:01,771 --> 00:58:05,706
so that he’ll appreciate you. All these
are tricks, you see?

641
00:58:05,907 --> 00:58:11,894
I tell you, men are very simple, but you
have to understand them.

642
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:14,480
Sometimes they get angry, doesn’t matter.

643
00:58:14,681 --> 00:58:19,361
Actually, if they are angry with somebody
else, they will come and put it on you.

644
00:58:19,536 --> 00:58:23,726
It’s better, because if they do anything
to others, they’ll beat them.

645
00:58:23,926 --> 00:58:26,831
You are not going to beat (them).

646
00:58:27,909 --> 00:58:33,148
If you understand few things about men,
it can work out.

647
00:58:33,349 --> 00:58:36,276
Of course, some are very miserable
husbands, I know,

648
00:58:36,477 --> 00:58:40,250
and some miserable wives – for them we have
divorce allowed

649
00:58:40,451 --> 00:58:44,260
in our Sahaja Yoga, we have divorce
for them.

650
00:58:44,461 --> 00:58:48,119
So that is the thing I wanted to tell you,

651
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:53,043
that you should make a very good housewife,
a very good Gruha Lakshmi.

652
00:58:53,244 --> 00:59:00,261
Now, why I am telling you this, that I am
suffering from Gruha Lakshmi’s chakra,

653
00:59:00,462 --> 00:59:04,936
and all the doctors have told Me it is
because in the collective

654
00:59:05,144 --> 00:59:13,386
Gruha Lakshmis are not all right, because
they are not good housewives.

655
00:59:13,587 --> 00:59:18,967
Like I’ll tell you now we have Swiss women.
They are very good, agreed about that,

656
00:59:19,168 --> 00:59:25,590
but very fond of cleanliness. Swiss are
mad after cleanliness, women, women.

657
00:59:25,797 --> 00:59:29,280
You can’t talk to them even for five
minutes. If you are sitting there

658
00:59:29,481 --> 00:59:32,047
they are picking up this, picking up that,
picking up that, picking all the…,

659
00:59:32,248 --> 00:59:37,321
cleaning, cleaning, cleaning. It’s very
difficult, Swiss women.

660
00:59:37,522 --> 00:59:40,065
Now, I was… - Eritrea,

661
00:59:40,266 --> 00:59:45,470
Alga told Me that the women of Eritrea
are known to be Swiss women.

662
00:59:45,671 --> 00:59:52,281
So, doesn’t matter if the house is little
untidy, if there’s something fallen off.

663
00:59:52,482 --> 00:59:55,303
In India no woman will do that.

664
00:59:55,504 --> 00:59:59,863
Now, the guests are sitting and she’s
with the Hoover.

665
01:00:05,513 --> 01:00:11,491
Like another thing is, like anything
breaks, say,

666
01:00:11,692 --> 01:00:14,924
supposing the thermometer breaks –
in India they’ll say, “Very good,

667
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:19,314
now there will be no temperature,
thermometer’s broken.”

668
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:22,413
But I’ve seen in the West, it’s very
surprising,

669
01:00:22,614 --> 01:00:28,899
supposing some coffee spills, I’m a guest,
immediately they’ll bring the Hoover,

670
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:32,491
bring something to clean it –
in the presence of the person.

671
01:00:32,692 --> 01:00:35,512
Now, if a glass breaks, finished.

672
01:00:35,713 --> 01:00:39,573
It’s not important. This is a very subtle
type of materialism, I think,

673
01:00:39,774 --> 01:00:43,584
that the person is sitting there, who is
a guest,

674
01:00:43,785 --> 01:00:50,930
and why are you trying to do all these
things in her presence or in his presence?

675
01:00:51,131 --> 01:00:55,184
But this Western women never understand.

676
01:00:55,385 --> 01:01:01,399
Another thing is, now, you go to an Indian
house. Their color scheme is different.

677
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:07,050
If you go to south Indians theirs is
different. Everybody has their own taste.

678
01:01:07,251 --> 01:01:10,762
As soon as they will enter –
Western women –

679
01:01:10,963 --> 01:01:15,074
“What a color scheme! What a thing you
have bought! Oh my God, this is horrible.”

680
01:01:15,275 --> 01:01:19,929
Immediately they will criticize
on the face.

681
01:01:20,130 --> 01:01:25,330
So another point is that you must always
consider the feelings of others.

682
01:01:25,531 --> 01:01:33,911
Woman is there to give proper understanding
of feelings of others, what they think.

683
01:01:34,112 --> 01:01:41,545
Or they go to an Indian house which
will be smelling of their food, “Huh”.

684
01:01:41,746 --> 01:01:44,959
They’ll eat the same food, they’ll enjoy
the food,

685
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:50,967
but they’ll try to show, to show that it is
something lower.

686
01:01:51,168 --> 01:01:53,821
This is very Western, I must say.

687
01:01:54,022 --> 01:02:00,861
If somebody is wearing a dress, immediately
they’ll pass a remark.

688
01:02:01,139 --> 01:02:06,758
Very Western idea. You will not find
good Indians doing that,

689
01:02:06,959 --> 01:02:10,730
I don’t know about the modern Indians
what sort of things they are.

690
01:02:10,931 --> 01:02:15,010
But immediately they’ll say things which
will hurt.

691
01:02:15,211 --> 01:02:18,743
This is not the way a woman should look.

692
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:23,654
On the contrary, always praise -
what’s the harm?

693
01:02:23,855 --> 01:02:30,081
By praising something you are not losing
your business.

694
01:02:30,282 --> 01:02:37,795
By saying, “What a nice thing, what a nice
sari, what nice clothes” – what’s the harm?

695
01:02:37,996 --> 01:02:42,625
You’ll enjoy your sweetness, you know?
Really enjoy your sweetness.

696
01:02:42,826 --> 01:02:46,946
It’s not telling lies, not to be that
honest also necessary.

697
01:02:47,147 --> 01:02:50,191
Because you don’t like something you must
say, “I don’t like it.”

698
01:02:50,392 --> 01:03:00,595
This word has to go from Sahaja Yoga.
“I like this and I don’t like that."

699
01:03:00,796 --> 01:03:08,401
If I, say, saying that, how many will
remain in Sahaja Yoga?

700
01:03:12,804 --> 01:03:18,007
So it’s very important to drop this
“I like it, I don’t like it.”

701
01:03:18,192 --> 01:03:20,619
Who are you to like or not like?

702
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:25,757
What about your Spirit? What about
your heart?

703
01:03:25,958 --> 01:03:32,148
So again the same thing comes to,
that women have to have a heart,

704
01:03:32,357 --> 01:03:40,152
very large heart, beautiful heart.
And your Guru is a Mother,

705
01:03:40,353 --> 01:03:44,938
so you have to be wonderful mothers
and wonderful wives

706
01:03:45,139 --> 01:03:49,648
and should have very, very large hearts.

707
01:03:53,248 --> 01:04:01,859
So that all this selfishness, even this
bank will collapse if you do that.

708
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:05,264
It is existing because we have small
hearts.

709
01:04:05,465 --> 01:04:11,279
If you have large hearts this will
collapse – isn’t it?

710
01:04:13,796 --> 01:04:18,977
I have said it, especially because I’ve had
many complaints about the women

711
01:04:19,178 --> 01:04:26,191
who are married here, some Indian women
also. That’s why I’m telling you.

712
01:04:26,392 --> 01:04:31,248
Best reports are about Russian women
I must say,

713
01:04:31,449 --> 01:04:34,555
very, very good reports about them.

714
01:04:34,756 --> 01:04:39,659
They are very satisfied souls, they want
very little, they are not greedy.

715
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:43,019
It’s surprising, communism has done
so much good to them.

716
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:49,191
It’s not communism, but the extremities
of communism has thrown them

717
01:04:49,392 --> 01:04:56,990
into that area where they don’t have any
sense of possession, they don’t have.

718
01:04:57,191 --> 01:05:00,042
Their government said, “All right, you can
have your flats and look after them.”

719
01:05:00,243 --> 01:05:03,808
Said, “We don’t want to have, you have it.”

720
01:05:04,376 --> 01:05:07,091
Government servants were told that
“you can have your cars”.

721
01:05:07,292 --> 01:05:10,978
Said, “No, no, we don’t want, you’d
better have.”

722
01:05:11,179 --> 01:05:15,970
Because just to own the car is such
a headache – they know.

723
01:05:16,171 --> 01:05:19,918
Let the government have the headache.
They are not, you know,

724
01:05:20,119 --> 01:05:24,388
sort of people who are even conscious
of possessiveness.

725
01:05:24,589 --> 01:05:27,819
Of course, now, they had some funny people.

726
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:32,420
I’m forgetting his name, who was finance
minister you had,

727
01:05:32,652 --> 01:05:38,933
and he was in Geneva, where he learned
all the tricks of the trade

728
01:05:39,103 --> 01:05:42,247
and he brought forth lots of reforms,
so-called.

729
01:05:42,448 --> 01:05:47,953
So now Leningrad and Moscow have become
very expensive places –

730
01:05:48,154 --> 01:05:50,674
thanks to Swiss influence.

731
01:05:50,875 --> 01:05:55,849
So this has happened there also, but still
the people are very good,

732
01:05:56,056 --> 01:06:01,533
and the ladies who come from there, even
Romanian girls are very much respected,

733
01:06:01,734 --> 01:06:06,316
now everybody wants Romanian or Russians,

734
01:06:11,554 --> 01:06:15,569
or from Kiev. But this time they didn’t
come,

735
01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:21,095
we are sorry they are not here, I’m missing
them all.

736
01:06:21,296 --> 01:06:28,197
Lastly, I have to tell you that there’s
a very good book, Arun Apte has written.

737
01:06:29,513 --> 01:06:32,675
This is the book. You all should buy it.

738
01:06:32,876 --> 01:06:36,290
I don’t know, what is the price you have
put it?

739
01:06:36,491 --> 01:06:39,809
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi about
the book and its price]

740
01:07:02,229 --> 01:07:05,495
Alright. So, those who want to have
this book should apply.

741
01:07:05,696 --> 01:07:09,276
There are only five, are here,
very good book.

742
01:07:09,477 --> 01:07:14,326
So, you will understand about Indian music.

743
01:07:14,527 --> 01:07:20,725
It is said that this music has come
from Omkara.

744
01:07:21,159 --> 01:07:28,040
And it is very sort of – sensible music.

745
01:07:28,241 --> 01:07:34,492
Now, I think all those musicians who sang
before Me,

746
01:07:34,693 --> 01:07:39,429
who were singing western song, was alright.

747
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:44,764
But what is missing in that: melody.
It’s not melodious.

748
01:07:44,965 --> 01:07:48,207
You see, is like little bit you sing,
then you sing this,

749
01:07:48,408 --> 01:07:52,005
then you shout, then you bring it down,
then do like this.

750
01:07:52,206 --> 01:07:56,274
And they think that they have to sing
through their heart.

751
01:07:56,475 --> 01:07:59,922
They have to express the feeling
of their heart.

752
01:08:00,123 --> 01:08:04,363
Now, supposing somebody is dejected,
so he sings the song of dejection.

753
01:08:04,564 --> 01:08:08,673
Then another one who is talking about love,
he starts to sing a song.

754
01:08:08,850 --> 01:08:14,371
He may not be, but artificially they want
to produce that effect.

755
01:08:14,572 --> 01:08:22,434
There is no need; to sing in parts,
like one word, then one word,

756
01:08:22,635 --> 01:08:26,271
there’s no melody in it, there’s no flow
in it.

757
01:08:26,472 --> 01:08:32,871
And, while, Russian songs, though they
were folk songs, were very melodious.

758
01:08:33,072 --> 01:08:37,241
But don’t worry, Americans are invading
that part also.

759
01:08:37,442 --> 01:08:40,000
They are having all this horrible music
there.

760
01:08:40,201 --> 01:08:45,621
Now, the music means, it should please you.
It should give you more entertainment;

761
01:08:45,822 --> 01:08:50,007
not to make you unhappy, not to make
you sad.

762
01:08:50,188 --> 01:08:57,330
If you have all these feelings within you,
then you should try to say like this:

763
01:08:57,498 --> 01:09:01,837
“Yes, there is problem, but I’ll get
over it.”

764
01:09:02,038 --> 01:09:05,937
Because you are Sahaja Yogis, you have
to show the victory;

765
01:09:06,138 --> 01:09:08,768
the victorious nature of yours,
in your music.

766
01:09:08,969 --> 01:09:13,926
I’m not talking about others; they go on
crying, weeping and singing.

767
01:09:14,126 --> 01:09:18,907
But there is no melody first of all, it is
just part, part, part, part.

768
01:09:19,132 --> 01:09:22,567
Even the orchestra, which I was surprised:
it all goes like this

769
01:09:22,768 --> 01:09:27,262
“ke, ke, ke, ke, ke”, then it goes
“ke, ke, ke, ke, ke”.

770
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:37,139
But Indian orchestra, you will see,
is melodious. It flows like a river.

771
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:43,784
So, this difference is very bad. So, I would
request all the musicians who are singing,

772
01:09:43,985 --> 01:09:54,813
the singing doesn’t mean that you use words
which nobody can understand.

773
01:09:55,014 --> 01:09:59,560
Words must be clear-cut and the melody
must be there.

774
01:09:59,761 --> 01:10:05,747
Now, in Indian ragas, there is melody
but words are not important.

775
01:10:05,947 --> 01:10:07,888
So, you enjoy the tune and everything,

776
01:10:08,089 --> 01:10:11,998
whether you know the language or not,
doesn’t matter.

777
01:10:12,199 --> 01:10:16,372
So, when you can combine melody
with western music,

778
01:10:16,573 --> 01:10:20,017
you will see how different it will be.

779
01:10:22,154 --> 01:10:25,738
And this book will teach you. This is
a very good book,

780
01:10:25,939 --> 01:10:28,583
which you should have, and which you should
understand

781
01:10:28,784 --> 01:10:38,019
that how the music can cure you,
music can give you joy,

782
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:44,517
what is the basic, the essence of music.
And then you can flower it out.

783
01:10:44,718 --> 01:10:49,955
I am sure, if Indian musicians take
to western music,

784
01:10:50,116 --> 01:10:56,159
will be much better than to western music
as it is.

785
01:10:57,608 --> 01:11:01,237
I can’t understand, these people are
so famous

786
01:11:01,438 --> 01:11:05,420
and people think they are very well-earning
and all that.

787
01:11:05,621 --> 01:11:11,015
In America, anybody can earn like that,
but to make it a proper music,

788
01:11:11,216 --> 01:11:13,964
I think you must have the basis
of Indian music.

789
01:11:14,165 --> 01:11:17,857
Then you can expand it as you like.

790
01:11:18,058 --> 01:11:24,182
Now, please try to buy this book,
to understand Indian music.

791
01:11:24,383 --> 01:11:28,647
There’s no price yet given, but it won’t be
much more than normal,

792
01:11:28,848 --> 01:11:35,126
so next time, I think for Diwali Puja, they
might bring more. Eh? Ganapatipule.

793
01:11:35,414 --> 01:11:41,978
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi to know
when the book will be available]

794
01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:44,849
Accha.

795
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:49,817
I will try to get more of these, but this
you must really read,

796
01:11:50,018 --> 01:11:56,391
because you will know what is the essence
of music, alright?

797
01:11:56,592 --> 01:12:06,313
And, lastly, today is the 4th day
of Navaratri

798
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:14,876
and they have given Me - some of them
are names which are really horrid,

799
01:12:18,914 --> 01:12:23,817
but they must be people who have suffered
so much

800
01:12:24,018 --> 01:12:31,107
and they asked Mother to kill those
horrible rakshasas.

801
01:12:31,308 --> 01:12:39,557
Now in a way, it all will kill in its
natural course, I know that.

802
01:12:39,758 --> 01:12:46,494
If you people take to sense, because you
are the ones who can do it.

803
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:55,015
If you do not try to acquire things which
you don’t want, unnecessary things.

804
01:12:55,216 --> 01:13:03,282
If you try to reduce all these things
and take to something natural

805
01:13:03,483 --> 01:13:08,390
and love the Mother Earth, I am sure
it will work out.

806
01:13:08,565 --> 01:13:12,681
The Mother Earth herself will work it out.

807
01:13:12,882 --> 01:13:19,506
You know this earthquake. Now nobody
is going in the church.

808
01:13:19,707 --> 01:13:25,063
But I didn’t do anything. It’s the Mother
Earth.

809
01:13:25,436 --> 01:13:32,235
Now nobody goes in the church. What -
I didn’t do anything, I would not.

810
01:13:32,436 --> 01:13:40,012
I was sorry for the art-pieces gone, but
see now how the nature is working out.

811
01:13:40,213 --> 01:13:46,718
Now Islamic people, these Islamic people
from Indonesia onward,

812
01:13:46,919 --> 01:13:52,708
all these people are suffering from
the smoke – I didn’t do that.

813
01:13:52,909 --> 01:13:56,215
Because when you try to do something wrong

814
01:13:56,416 --> 01:14:00,512
it comes back to you. Action has
a reaction.

815
01:14:03,194 --> 01:14:07,481
So, your faces should be Sahaj. You should
be Sahaj.

816
01:14:07,682 --> 01:14:13,566
You shouldn’t look like strained people.
I can’t understand.

817
01:14:13,767 --> 01:14:19,631
You are Sahaj and be in that Sahaj mood.
I’m sorry I’ve taken so much time,

818
01:14:19,832 --> 01:14:23,488
but tomorrow I won’t be able to speak
all these things to you.

819
01:14:23,689 --> 01:14:28,550
And you should try to think about it,
that “Our Mother loves me,

820
01:14:28,751 --> 01:14:32,935
She wants us to have a good family, She
wants us to look after our children.”

821
01:14:33,136 --> 01:14:38,074
So, I have advised all the men, as well
as the women.

822
01:14:38,275 --> 01:14:41,715
It’s better to be hen-pecked, there’s
no harm.

823
01:14:41,916 --> 01:14:45,403
But hen-pecked doesn’t mean they are
hen-pecked.

824
01:14:45,604 --> 01:14:51,169
See, they are – just to please your wife,
what’s the harm?

825
01:14:52,943 --> 01:14:59,017
But that doesn’t mean if she dominates you.
That’s not the thing.

826
01:14:59,218 --> 01:15:03,562
Like, “Come to my father’s house, I must
go to my mother’s house”.

827
01:15:03,762 --> 01:15:07,469
All these kind of things you should not
permit.

828
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:12,753
But women should also understand,
her family is more important

829
01:15:12,954 --> 01:15:17,537
than father, mother, even Mataji.

830
01:15:18,838 --> 01:15:23,767
Because I’ll be only happy to see a happy
family.

831
01:15:24,707 --> 01:15:26,980
So, thank you very much.
