1
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,417
When we talk of materialism,

2
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:18,792
we are acting against our Mother Earth.

3
00:00:21,882 --> 00:00:26,549
Instead of learning from Her subtler qualities,

4
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:30,509
we are trying to exploit Her, to dig her out,

5
00:00:30,749 --> 00:00:34,958
to use Her for our selfish motives.

6
00:00:36,707 --> 00:00:39,791
What does She do to us?

7
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:44,375
She creates these beautiful fruits for you to eat.

8
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:48,250
She creates beautiful trees for you to make furniture,

9
00:00:48,707 --> 00:00:50,625
to make nice houses.

10
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:55,667
She gives you green grass to soothe your nerves.

11
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:03,874
She carries so many rivers and so many huge big oceans

12
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:07,083
on Her being.

13
00:01:07,164 --> 00:01:11,164
She’s always larger than the largest of oceans.

14
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:15,208
Such a great thing as She is,

15
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:20,999
what do we do to Her is to exploit Her fully,

16
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:24,125
indiscriminately.

17
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,833
Then the reactions are set in.

18
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,749
The beautiful cycle of nature is broken

19
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:32,458
by our aggressive attitude,

20
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:36,667
and absolutely indiscreet.

21
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:42,583
Then this Mother Earth doesn’t do anything as such

22
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:46,041
Herself, not much;

23
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,708
but then the ether starts acting,

24
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:55,708
and you have problems, what we call as acid rains,

25
00:01:56,208 --> 00:02:00,708
plastic, all kinds of problems that come out of this

26
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:03,997
indiscreet creation.

27
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,999
When we started making machinery,

28
00:02:08,232 --> 00:02:10,441
without any balance

29
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,625
we started producing machinery,

30
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,667
just like mad.

31
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:24,333
As a result of that, now we have become slaves of machines.

32
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:27,387
We can’t do anything with our own hands.

33
00:02:27,542 --> 00:02:31,874
Because of machines, people have become unemployed.

34
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,178
As I’ve said many a times that machines are for us,

35
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,500
we are not for the machines.

36
00:02:38,816 --> 00:02:41,275
But today the situation is very different.

37
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:44,417
We are entirely into the hands of machines –

38
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:48,083
again the same indiscreet behavior,

39
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:52,166
again the same imbalances.

40
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:56,291
Mother Earth teaches us balance.

41
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,583
If She was not in a balance,

42
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:01,208
we would have been all finished.

43
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:03,707
She teaches us gravity.

44
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:10,625
She teaches us how to be attractive to another person

45
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:14,791
without the other person knowing about it,

46
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:18,125
feeling about it.

47
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:25,749
Without enslaving, without mesmerizing,

48
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:33,874
without obliging, to attract and to give

49
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,958
without expectations.

50
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,417
Without any expectations She gives us;

51
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,542
whether we respect Her not,

52
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,625
whether we’ll treat Her not,

53
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,041
we give Her.

54
00:03:47,245 --> 00:03:51,619
Possessiveness is not the quality of Mother Earth,

55
00:03:52,037 --> 00:03:54,495
She doesn’t possess anyone.

56
00:03:54,495 --> 00:03:57,619
For example, if you are an Indian

57
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,495
you can come to England, you can go anywhere,

58
00:04:00,703 --> 00:04:02,120
you can live anywhere.

59
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:04,454
She doesn’t possess anyone as such;

60
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:09,454
we only the human beings have made this world into

61
00:04:09,786 --> 00:04:11,786
different countries, different places –

62
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,620
all our own ideas of stupidity.

63
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:18,661
There’s only one world,

64
00:04:19,037 --> 00:04:21,661
there’s only one world God has created.

65
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,245
He has not created …

66
00:04:23,703 --> 00:04:27,953
It’s rather awkward here. Allright now better.

67
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:49,953
She has not created all these nations.

68
00:04:49,953 --> 00:04:53,245
Only there are ravines

69
00:04:54,162 --> 00:04:58,953
through which big rivers flow.

70
00:04:59,318 --> 00:05:02,734
Sometimes, wherever She has raised Herself,

71
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:05,995
there are mountains.

72
00:05:06,132 --> 00:05:10,381
These are Her different dulations and different varieties,

73
00:05:10,924 --> 00:05:12,841
just to create beauty.

74
00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:16,956
Supposing the whole world was like a bald-headed

75
00:05:17,037 --> 00:05:20,830
gentleman, what would have happened to us?

76
00:05:20,911 --> 00:05:25,952
First of all, we all would have slipped out, I think!

77
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:30,028
Or else, what would have happened

78
00:05:30,225 --> 00:05:34,643
if it was nothing but just all over the forest,

79
00:05:35,276 --> 00:05:38,151
or all over only the mountains,

80
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:41,165
or all over just the rivers?

81
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:50,120
To create the beauty She has used all these things

82
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:57,366
to make us happy, to give us joy, to entertain us.

83
00:05:57,911 --> 00:06:01,412
She created all this beautiful stage for us.

84
00:06:01,681 --> 00:06:03,348
And what do we do?

85
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:06,137
We have divided Her into parts,

86
00:06:06,828 --> 00:06:09,537
that this is my country,

87
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:14,745
this is your country, this is their country.

88
00:06:15,493 --> 00:06:20,951
When we die, what is our country?

89
00:06:22,805 --> 00:06:24,390
We are all dead bodies,

90
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:28,162
whether you are buried in a church or in the open,

91
00:06:28,243 --> 00:06:30,327
you are all in the Mother Earth.

92
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:36,113
What is our country is that we are the Mother Earth.

93
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:40,468
So we have to understand that this body is made

94
00:06:40,549 --> 00:06:43,175
out of that Mother Earth to which it has to go,

95
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:47,870
and we are stupid to feel that we belong to this country or to that country.

96
00:06:47,951 --> 00:06:52,700
Of course, this is the greatest miracle of the maya,

97
00:06:52,781 --> 00:06:54,162
that people know this

98
00:06:54,243 --> 00:06:56,827
but still they do not want to believe it.

99
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,537
There are so many truths they know:

100
00:06:59,618 --> 00:07:02,181
they are sure, they know about it,

101
00:07:02,262 --> 00:07:04,263
but they don’t want to believe it.

102
00:07:04,765 --> 00:07:07,640
Or they believe it, but they don’t want to accept it.

103
00:07:07,972 --> 00:07:12,124
And even if they accept it, they don’t want to know about it.

104
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:17,307
It’s a funny human miracle that they know

105
00:07:17,388 --> 00:07:19,861
that nothing belongs to us.

106
00:07:19,957 --> 00:07:23,146
When we come on this Earth our hands are like this;

107
00:07:23,227 --> 00:07:26,185
when we go, everything is like this.
