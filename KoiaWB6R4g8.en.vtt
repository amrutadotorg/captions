00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.335
So, today, I want to tell you about purity.

00:00:12.943 --> 00:00:15.644
That is my name, 'nir',

00:00:15.644 --> 00:00:17.644
Nir-mala.

00:00:17.644 --> 00:00:21.126
’Ni’ means ‘no’; ’mala’ means ‘impure’.

00:00:21.126 --> 00:00:24.364
The one who has no impurities is Nirmala.

00:00:24.895 --> 00:00:27.690
and that’s one of the names of the Goddess also.

00:00:34.587 --> 00:00:41.564
Purity is a quality which is silent,

00:00:41.564 --> 00:00:44.379
it speaks in silence.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.820
It is one of the most non-aggressive activities.

00:00:53.392 --> 00:00:55.716
It probes into you.

00:00:56.452 --> 00:00:59.863
It doesn’t express in any way.

00:00:59.863 --> 00:01:03.282
Even love may express: in words,

00:01:03.282 --> 00:01:05.017
it may express in action.

00:01:05.495 --> 00:01:10.895
But this is the one
which is expressionless, the purity.

00:01:11.374 --> 00:01:18.109
And it washes off all that is impure.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.812
You cannot, by rationality understand

00:01:27.812 --> 00:01:30.507
how it works out.

00:01:31.235 --> 00:01:36.604
You have to feel it and know it,

00:01:36.604 --> 00:01:41.430
that it is working out its process.

00:01:42.164 --> 00:01:45.114
It’s very delicate.

00:01:45.644 --> 00:01:48.775
Sometimes, it’s flooding also.

00:01:49.606 --> 00:01:55.154
But it is never shocking, never.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.464
When I say that,

00:02:02.464 --> 00:02:07.520
you find the human ideas have become lob headed.

00:02:07.986 --> 00:02:10.531
When do we become lob headed?

00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:12.816
Means 'upside down'.

00:02:13.887 --> 00:02:17.776
When we are plunging into something.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.757
We are plunging into something where we are going to get destroyed.

00:02:26.302 --> 00:02:28.849
We are upside-down.

00:02:29.806 --> 00:02:32.742
This comes out of impurities,

00:02:32.742 --> 00:02:38.468
that you cannot see things correctly in their right perspective.

00:02:42.607 --> 00:02:48.477
So let us see what are the things which we think

00:02:49.508 --> 00:02:53.033
create impurities in us.

00:02:56.654 --> 00:03:02.469
They say it in two words, you see: lust and greed.

00:03:03.942 --> 00:03:11.121
In Sanskrit, they'll say: "kama [erostism], Kanaka [gold]";
woman and gold.

00:03:12.152 --> 00:03:17.208
But ‘woman’ doesn’t mean, ’Woman’ means ‘lust’

00:03:17.208 --> 00:03:22.683
and ‘greed’ means ‘gold’.

00:03:26.278 --> 00:03:32.759
Now let us see if really these are impure things,

00:03:33.127 --> 00:03:37.425
or they create impurity in us,

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:47.434
or why these two things have become the source of impurity to us?

00:03:53.361 --> 00:03:58.422
Because we do not understand the right perspective

00:03:58.422 --> 00:04:03.349
of matter and of sex.

00:04:04.268 --> 00:04:09.972
If we can understand them in right perspective,

00:04:10.892 --> 00:04:16.858
then these two become the source of happiness and joy to us.

00:04:18.853 --> 00:04:26.509
For example, say, a tree, it has two sides:

00:04:26.997 --> 00:04:30.017
it has the shoot and the root.

00:04:30.017 --> 00:04:34.869
If the root becomes upward and the shoot becomes downward,

00:04:35.644 --> 00:04:38.074
it will not survive.

00:04:39.361 --> 00:04:43.887
The root has to go down into the earth

00:04:43.887 --> 00:04:47.019
and the shoot has to come up.

00:04:47.606 --> 00:04:53.923
The root has the capacity to suck in the liquids

00:04:53.923 --> 00:04:57.594
that are inside the soil.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.550
Also, it has capacity to digest

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:09.226
all the essential salts necessary for him.

00:05:10.073 --> 00:05:15.646
Supposing now the root starts malfunctioning

00:05:16.132 --> 00:05:20.773
and starts sucking the impurities

00:05:20.994 --> 00:05:26.170
instead of the pure things that are needed

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.919
for the body of the tree.

00:05:30.341 --> 00:05:32.681
Then what will happen?

00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:35.739
There will be malnutrition

00:05:35.739 --> 00:05:38.016
and the tree will collapse.

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.364
But the root has the wisdom to pick up

00:05:42.364 --> 00:05:47.448
the necessary salts for its nourishment.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:55.315
This is where we must understand that

00:05:55.644 --> 00:05:59.288
we do not have proper feelers

00:06:00.834 --> 00:06:03.313
for our own nourishment

00:06:03.313 --> 00:06:07.268
and we blame God, or we blame nature, we blame societies,

00:06:07.268 --> 00:06:12.453
we blame cultures, we blame our parents, we blame our governments,

00:06:12.453 --> 00:06:15.367
we blame this and that.

00:06:16.913 --> 00:06:21.051
Because we have no feelers,

00:06:21.051 --> 00:06:25.900
we suck in that is impure,

00:06:26.905 --> 00:06:30.304
which will create more problems for us

00:06:30.304 --> 00:06:35.644
than joy and happiness and nourishment.

00:06:36.404 --> 00:06:38.304
If the tree has to grow,

00:06:38.304 --> 00:06:42.682
it should avoid all that is poisonous to it,

00:06:42.682 --> 00:06:45.354
all that is impure.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.806
And there could be two methods.

00:06:51.027 --> 00:06:54.275
If your rationality is that high graded,

00:06:54.275 --> 00:06:57.391
if your intelligence is of that calibre,

00:06:57.722 --> 00:07:05.464
you just deny all that, to your body, which is not good, to your spiritual body,

00:07:05.464 --> 00:07:09.798
or to your mental body, or to your emotional body, or to your physical body.

00:07:09.798 --> 00:07:14.204
You just deny it, if you have that much of pure intelligence.

00:07:16.194 --> 00:07:20.374
But the intelligence has not reached that Divine strata yet.

00:07:20.374 --> 00:07:25.887
So we devise, compromise easily.

00:07:26.097 --> 00:07:30.777
But whom are you harming? You are harming yourself.

00:07:32.802 --> 00:07:36.689
We go on collecting impurities very fast.

00:07:39.703 --> 00:07:42.983
And that’s what I call, is the human freedom:

00:07:43.351 --> 00:07:46.097
if he wants he can collect impurities.

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:50.196
A tree is not. It will not collect impurities.

00:07:52.656 --> 00:07:55.085
but if impurities invade it,

00:07:55.085 --> 00:07:58.400
it will die, it cannot protect either.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.225
Human beings have a freedom to choose.

00:08:01.225 --> 00:08:06.674
Also they have the power to protect

00:08:08.846 --> 00:08:14.946
from the new impurities. And Sahaja Yogis,
as you know, have much more powers.

00:08:18.946 --> 00:08:25.218
So our roots have to go down, into what? Into dharma,

00:08:25.218 --> 00:08:29.610
into sustaining power of love.

00:08:30.544 --> 00:08:36.363
If that is weak, then the roots are taken off

00:08:36.363 --> 00:08:40.052
and such people are uprooted.

00:08:41.544 --> 00:08:48.905
In the traditions, in the historical mistakes and errors of our elders,

00:08:50.444 --> 00:08:55.174
we can see what mistakes they have done and learn from them,

00:08:57.664 --> 00:09:03.044
and avoid the impurities that they had and [that] destroyed themselves.

00:09:03.044 --> 00:09:08.382
We can see in big empires fell, crashed, in no time.

00:09:08.382 --> 00:09:12.070
Why? What did they do?

00:09:12.724 --> 00:09:14.724
We are not going to do that.

00:09:15.224 --> 00:09:19.351
But so far I've not known any nation that sits down

00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:23.070
and gets a comprehensive look of the whole picture:

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:26.724
Why that nation has fallen down? Why these ones destroyed themselves?

00:09:27.404 --> 00:09:31.104
So far, I have not known any political leader of that type.

00:09:31.399 --> 00:09:33.399
They’ll do patchwork,

00:09:33.399 --> 00:09:37.684
but none of them sit down to see why the whole sky collapsed,

00:09:38.004 --> 00:09:40.721
what happened to those people

00:09:40.721 --> 00:09:45.644
who enjoyed so much of power once upon a time, suddenly collapsed.

00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:52.084
If somebody could sit down like that then he would see that they sucked in the impurities.

00:09:53.604 --> 00:09:58.690
Now how do you suck impurities?

00:10:00.264 --> 00:10:05.644
You suck them because your feelers become blunt.

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:09.836
When your feelers are blunt,

00:10:09.836 --> 00:10:13.654
you don’t know what you are sucking.

00:10:14.664 --> 00:10:21.024
It only is possible when you are lob-headed, is the word.

00:10:24.484 --> 00:10:34.617
In the beginning, the body, the mind resist to all that is impure,

00:10:37.104 --> 00:10:39.212
in most of the cases I would say.

00:10:39.212 --> 00:10:41.364
Some of the devils if they are born,

00:10:41.364 --> 00:10:46.099
they may be children but their filths are exceptional.

00:10:46.099 --> 00:10:51.771
But most of the human beings are born in innocence

00:10:51.771 --> 00:10:54.604
and they resist.

00:10:56.125 --> 00:11:03.016
Gradually you start making your feelers damaged

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.822
and then the impurity starts coming in.

00:11:10.424 --> 00:11:17.091
All these things start, people say, from desire,

00:11:17.624 --> 00:11:19.531
clearly:

00:11:22.224 --> 00:11:28.107
desire to be the king, desire to be most beautiful person,

00:11:28.107 --> 00:11:31.119
desire to be leader of the whole world,

00:11:31.119 --> 00:11:37.424
desire to eat, desire to have, possess — all desires.

00:11:40.224 --> 00:11:44.744
But here also, I would say, is an impurity.

00:11:46.564 --> 00:11:53.284
Desire in all of these things is reaching the point that is joy.

00:11:54.035 --> 00:11:57.585
We desire the joy.

00:12:00.464 --> 00:12:05.584
The desire for joy, if you keep it pure, then "You go on,  you get it".

00:12:05.584 --> 00:12:08.164
No. This is not the way that gives joy.

00:12:08.164 --> 00:12:11.527
This is not the thing that gives joy. We can see it around us.

00:12:12.524 --> 00:12:20.643
Those who are seeking money, you should go  and see if they reach it.

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:26.229
You will know they are not people who have joy, obviously.

00:12:30.384 --> 00:12:36.169
And when you go to people who are in joy and in tranquility,

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:40.830
you find they are talking of something else!

00:12:44.144 --> 00:12:55.284
When we have accepted the desire as something wrong

00:12:55.824 --> 00:13:00.342
we also negate the ultimate desire.

00:13:01.884 --> 00:13:10.269
But the essence, you know, 'swa'. We call the essence as 'swa'. ‘Swa’ means 'Self'.

00:13:11.049 --> 00:13:15.644
Essence of everything is that:

00:13:16.444 --> 00:13:20.484
If you want to have a beautiful tree in front of your house,

00:13:20.484 --> 00:13:23.244
the desire is to be joyous.

00:13:23.244 --> 00:13:27.784
What does a tree matter to you, if it does not give you joy?

00:13:27.784 --> 00:13:32.777
It's like anything in the world as you know.

00:13:38.064 --> 00:13:47.984
That joy, that essence of everything, if it is kept pure,

00:13:49.984 --> 00:13:53.344
then it’s nourishing you.

00:13:53.602 --> 00:13:59.494
Like the tree roots embed themselves in the Mother soil

00:13:59.494 --> 00:14:05.644
and suck the beauties of the Mother soil,

00:14:05.644 --> 00:14:09.994
the essence of Mother, that is meant for nourishing

00:14:10.144 --> 00:14:13.175
and enrich themselves.

00:14:15.924 --> 00:14:20.504
But that doesn't mean by any chance, by any luring

00:14:20.504 --> 00:14:25.276
that you lose your character or individuality — you do not.

00:14:25.424 --> 00:14:29.304
You see, a mango tree will be a mango tree.

00:14:29.602 --> 00:14:33.377
A banana tree will be a banana tree.

00:14:35.624 --> 00:14:39.241
Because the outside is different,

00:14:39.241 --> 00:14:41.500
the inside is the same.

00:14:42.504 --> 00:14:48.134
And in every country the Mother Earth has its own varieties:

00:14:48.134 --> 00:14:52.817
accordingly, you will have trees, you will have plants.

00:14:53.464 --> 00:14:56.624
You cannot have mango in England.

00:14:56.845 --> 00:15:03.630
But you cannot have say, a birch tree in India.

00:15:05.644 --> 00:15:10.542
But it makes no difference as long as they are fully nourished.

00:15:12.424 --> 00:15:17.342
So, your character is not lost, your individuality is not lost.

00:15:17.633 --> 00:15:20.423
On the contrary it’s made better.

00:15:20.864 --> 00:15:25.644
In its purest form, every character is beautiful.

00:15:26.384 --> 00:15:31.832
Every religion, in its purest form, is the seed of God,

00:15:32.104 --> 00:15:37.470
are the different facets of one diamond, that is God.

00:15:38.084 --> 00:15:43.353
They have to be there. And whatever angle you go, you see them sparkling.

00:15:44.004 --> 00:15:46.372
At every angle, they sparkle.

00:15:46.372 --> 00:15:48.666
A diamond sparkles at every angle.

00:15:48.733 --> 00:15:54.033
Because it has got its own character,

00:15:54.284 --> 00:15:58.136
unique variety and its different forms.

00:15:58.604 --> 00:16:04.389
So, the essential unity between them is through the sap which is running.

00:16:05.084 --> 00:16:11.903
If our attention is on that purity of oneness

00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:19.159
then so many of other impurities that have cropped up within us, will also come out.

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:27.051
The other impurity we suffer from, is loss of collectiveness.

00:16:29.584 --> 00:16:33.048
We don’t mind wearing the same dresses all over the world.

00:16:33.048 --> 00:16:36.785
If a jeans starts, all of the places you go, even in Japan,

00:16:36.785 --> 00:16:41.864
you'll go to Australia, you'll go to, even to China communist countries,

00:16:41.864 --> 00:16:44.880
anywhere, the jean everyone is wearing.

00:16:45.464 --> 00:16:51.606
But the essential unity within us in its purest form, nowhere.

00:16:54.524 --> 00:16:59.281
Of course, these feelers you develop after Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:59.624 --> 00:17:02.939
But if you have failed in your dharmas,

00:17:03.184 --> 00:17:05.184
that’s the base, it's the root,

00:17:05.184 --> 00:17:09.512
if we do not have those roots properly done,

00:17:09.512 --> 00:17:12.759
then the tree cannot stand. It is necessary.

00:17:13.204 --> 00:17:16.913
Of course, the incarnation is just the opposite of that.

00:17:16.913 --> 00:17:18.767
His roots are in the heavens.

00:17:19.324 --> 00:17:21.821
He flowers on the tree.

00:17:23.584 --> 00:17:28.047
An incarnation does not break its dharma

00:17:30.084 --> 00:17:32.578
— it is dharma.

00:17:33.584 --> 00:17:36.456
He does not need. He’s dharmateet. He’s beyond dharma.

00:17:36.456 --> 00:17:40.756
Whatever he does is the religion of the whole world!

00:17:41.504 --> 00:17:44.557
Nothing touches Him.

00:17:44.962 --> 00:17:48.619
His roots are in the Divine,

00:17:48.619 --> 00:17:52.369
only the Divine Force. There’s no question of impurity in them,

00:17:52.664 --> 00:17:58.024
no question of clearing them or bathing them.

00:17:58.024 --> 00:18:00.324
Because he is in the Divine force

00:18:00.324 --> 00:18:03.387
and he’s sucking that out and giving it to you.

00:18:03.387 --> 00:18:06.376
He’s flowering on the tree, it’s upside-down tree,

00:18:06.844 --> 00:18:10.059
embedded in you.

00:18:11.904 --> 00:18:16.450
So, for an incarnation there is no dharma. He's beyond dharma,

00:18:16.804 --> 00:18:19.986
He’s ‘gunateet’. He is beyond all moods [gunas].

00:18:19.986 --> 00:18:22.522
He’s beyond everything.

00:18:23.124 --> 00:18:26.284
But human beings have to sustain their dharma,

00:18:28.284 --> 00:18:35.644
then rise, rise beyond themselves

00:18:36.844 --> 00:18:39.691
into collective consciousness.

00:18:40.204 --> 00:18:46.782
And when they turn upside-down, they become incarnations.

00:18:47.504 --> 00:18:49.839
It's possible.

00:18:49.839 --> 00:18:54.268
Two persons have done that so far: Buddha and Mahavira,

00:18:54.268 --> 00:18:57.046
you can call them as Deities.

00:18:57.624 --> 00:19:00.095
Only these two persons have done it.

00:19:00.095 --> 00:19:05.320
And in Sahaja Yoga, if we do that, we might be incarnations,

00:19:08.604 --> 00:19:12.979
when our roots will be in the Divinity.

00:19:13.264 --> 00:19:16.268
Here you have to choose.

00:19:17.164 --> 00:19:20.290
Still the freedom of choice exists for you.

00:19:20.724 --> 00:19:23.510
For Me there is no freedom at all.

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:25.830
I cannot choose the impurity.

00:19:26.984 --> 00:19:29.977
That’s why I say I have no temptations.

00:19:30.484 --> 00:19:34.259
I have no sense of possession. I'm planned.

00:19:35.044 --> 00:19:39.228
So, the choice doesn’t exist for Me at all, of anything.

00:19:39.504 --> 00:19:42.314
I have no time and space.

00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:46.384
I am spaceless. I am timeless,

00:19:47.342 --> 00:19:52.508
because my roots are in my being.

00:19:54.864 --> 00:19:59.816
But even to have the blossom within yourself

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.556
and for others to enjoy,

00:20:02.556 --> 00:20:08.686
even to nourish yourself, you have to have your dharma properly nourrished.

00:20:09.864 --> 00:20:14.009
So, we come to the question of lust and greed.

00:20:15.304 --> 00:20:27.329
Lust and greed are to be seen in this light.

00:20:29.004 --> 00:20:31.904
Are we lusty of God?

00:20:31.904 --> 00:20:35.444
Are we greedy of His wealth?

00:20:38.744 --> 00:20:43.389
If you ask such a question, then you see the purity.

00:20:45.784 --> 00:20:52.313
We waste so much time thinking about greed and lust,

00:20:59.314 --> 00:21:06.285
but very little time we have to think of this essential desire.

00:21:08.864 --> 00:21:12.787
Now, there are two types of things,

00:21:12.787 --> 00:21:17.518
one that is of a human being and one of an incarnation.

00:21:17.739 --> 00:21:24.031
That’s why the behaviour of incarnations cannot determine the behaviour of human beings.

00:21:24.544 --> 00:21:27.789
This is a very big mistake we have been always committing.

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:30.010
And please beware:

00:21:30.525 --> 00:21:33.824
you cannot be incarnations now,

00:21:33.824 --> 00:21:40.086
and you should not determine your behaviour according to the behaviour of an incarnation.

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:43.340
Because an incarnation is above all these things.

00:21:44.262 --> 00:21:47.751
It’s a different thing altogether, as I told you.

00:21:48.524 --> 00:21:55.239
A tree must take its nourishment, or be embedded in the Divine.

00:21:55.564 --> 00:21:58.941
You have to rise, still, to that stage,

00:21:59.344 --> 00:22:02.773
where your seeds might go into that.

00:22:03.068 --> 00:22:08.388
And maybe the trees will go and inform the Divine towards that.

00:22:10.144 --> 00:22:16.070
So, the pattern of life that is followed by an incarnation

00:22:17.044 --> 00:22:23.496
is always followed and that’s why false religions fail.

00:22:23.884 --> 00:22:29.604
For example, we’ll say, "Christ took a hunter in his hand and started lashing at people

00:22:29.604 --> 00:22:33.049
beating them when they were selling God".

00:22:33.049 --> 00:22:35.977
I feel the same way and I am doing it.

00:22:36.235 --> 00:22:40.215
If you read Kabir, you will find he’s slashing at all these people.

00:22:40.964 --> 00:22:45.644
If you read Mohammad sahib, he has criticised them.

00:22:46.384 --> 00:22:51.569
But you are not the incarnation.

00:22:52.324 --> 00:22:54.667
You are not incarnations

00:22:54.984 --> 00:22:59.031
in you, when you have those impurities.

00:22:59.364 --> 00:23:04.184
Because what I see, that human beings nurture them within themselves

00:23:04.444 --> 00:23:07.186
and they like to see the drama in that.

00:23:07.186 --> 00:23:10.337
For example, they’ll go to a picture of a drama

00:23:10.852 --> 00:23:14.333
and they’ll see a cruel man, hitting someone.

00:23:14.922 --> 00:23:17.962
And they say, "What a cruel man! He is horrid!"

00:23:17.962 --> 00:23:21.004
But they don’t know that cruelty they share into themselves.

00:23:21.836 --> 00:23:27.412
They want to call others cruel, but not the cruelty that exists within them.

00:23:29.304 --> 00:23:33.224
You see, as far as others are concerned they become a witness.

00:23:33.224 --> 00:23:35.852
But as far as they are concerned, they are not.

00:23:35.852 --> 00:23:40.202
If they could be, if they could be a witness to themselves,

00:23:40.524 --> 00:23:44.765
if they could see themselves, then what would happen,

00:23:44.765 --> 00:23:50.524
that their purifying forces within them would start

00:23:50.524 --> 00:23:52.524
- specially for Sahaja Yogis -

00:23:52.524 --> 00:23:55.644
because it has opened now, the tap is open,

00:23:56.184 --> 00:23:58.152
the Spirit is emitting just now.

00:23:58.152 --> 00:24:03.984
Only you see where it is within you, with your attention inward, in your being.

00:24:04.499 --> 00:24:08.421
Just put it within you! Do not justify it by saying,

00:24:08.679 --> 00:24:12.919
"My society is bad. My parents are bad. This happened.

00:24:12.919 --> 00:24:16.166
Because of this, it has happened, because ..." No!

00:24:18.724 --> 00:24:22.303
They are there because you are harbouring them.

00:24:22.303 --> 00:24:26.804
In others, you can see clearly, but in yourself, you cannot see.

00:24:26.804 --> 00:24:31.339
That is what a human mind is: it's a very funny mind,

00:24:32.124 --> 00:24:34.934
which is been evolved that way.

00:24:35.644 --> 00:24:39.790
You read a book, for example if you read somebody’s book:

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:45.525
immediately, you are identified with the hero and never with the villain.

00:24:46.144 --> 00:24:50.497
We don’t know, the villain is much more there than hero, inside, you see.

00:24:50.844 --> 00:24:54.198
It’s a common thing I have seen with human beings, you see.

00:24:54.198 --> 00:24:58.976
I have now learnt through many lives and this one what a human being is.

00:24:59.404 --> 00:25:02.864
Just the opposite is again with an incarnation.

00:25:02.864 --> 00:25:05.644
Just the opposite is an incarnation.

00:25:06.844 --> 00:25:10.369
You see, supposing you have a problem within yourselves,

00:25:10.764 --> 00:25:15.644
immediately, I try to see in myself where the problem lies.

00:25:15.844 --> 00:25:18.861
In my own vastness, I correct it and you get it

00:25:19.464 --> 00:25:22.974
because you are my body.

00:25:23.564 --> 00:25:27.664
You are within Me, all Sahaja Yogis are within Me,

00:25:27.664 --> 00:25:30.804
which I search and find out

00:25:32.164 --> 00:25:38.224
That’s how I do it. And unless and until I do it, I don’t feel all right, you have seen that.

00:25:38.224 --> 00:25:42.420
My problems are very different from yours.

00:25:45.544 --> 00:25:48.833
So, we have to pay attention to ourselves.

00:25:49.024 --> 00:25:53.164
But attention in a way which is very pure wisdom,

00:25:54.444 --> 00:25:57.646
is a deeper attention, it's not superficial.

00:25:58.164 --> 00:26:01.704
One should learn to go deep into yourself and see,

00:26:01.704 --> 00:26:04.991
"Are we cruel people?"

00:26:05.704 --> 00:26:08.323
"Am I cruel? I don't know.

00:26:08.366 --> 00:26:11.264
Which part of mine is cruel?"

00:26:11.864 --> 00:26:15.604
"Which part of mine is harming others?”

00:26:15.604 --> 00:26:18.360
Now this boy who came, he wouldn’t take out his socks

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.849
because he thought there was a smell of it.

00:26:20.849 --> 00:26:22.849
Are we fragrant ourselves?

00:26:23.884 --> 00:26:28.594
Are we considerate about it that we are equally fragrant?

00:26:28.844 --> 00:26:31.517
It’s a silent process,

00:26:31.517 --> 00:26:34.784
it’s a stillness inside of you, acting.

00:26:37.424 --> 00:26:40.307
And this has to be there.

00:26:40.684 --> 00:26:45.644
And because, as I said, in the Western countries, you see, they are crashed people,

00:26:48.984 --> 00:26:52.264
it is much more necessary for you people to work harder,

00:26:52.264 --> 00:26:54.344
than the people who are yet to crash down.

00:26:54.344 --> 00:26:58.203
They are about to, most of them are coming behind you.

00:26:58.684 --> 00:27:03.536
And you have to announce with a horn, “Now don’t crash!

00:27:03.536 --> 00:27:06.643
"We have crashed". That you have to do.

00:27:07.204 --> 00:27:09.204
That’s very important.

00:27:09.535 --> 00:27:12.608
Any man who has any consideration,

00:27:12.608 --> 00:27:15.095
any feeling for others,

00:27:15.604 --> 00:27:21.532
if he gets hurt by a stone on his way

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:25.441
he’ll immediately stand there and say, “Oh, there’s a stone here, now go.

00:27:25.441 --> 00:27:28.330
Be careful, don’t topple here. Be careful."

00:27:29.484 --> 00:27:33.644
When we are hurt by certain foolishness and stupidities,

00:27:33.644 --> 00:27:38.515
or you can say even the impurities that we have assembled within ourselves,

00:27:38.515 --> 00:27:42.195
you see, our own egoistical pursuits,

00:27:42.724 --> 00:27:47.425
let us announce to the world that, “We have been foolish. We have done it.

00:27:47.425 --> 00:27:50.452
We are broken people, we have broken our hands, we have broken our heads,

00:27:50.452 --> 00:27:53.223
we have broken our chakras. Now you don’t,

00:27:53.223 --> 00:27:57.188
for heaven’s sake you don’t!” Because they are following you.

00:27:59.384 --> 00:28:04.642
They think you are going on an ascent. They don’t know you have had enough of it.

00:28:05.264 --> 00:28:08.491
In every way possible, you have to announce it.

00:28:08.491 --> 00:28:12.628
But the announcement is expected by people.

00:28:12.628 --> 00:28:17.077
You see, it's such a funny world to be a perfect person.

00:28:20.104 --> 00:28:23.427
So, they want also your ascent.

00:28:24.724 --> 00:28:26.724
This is what the world is, you see.

00:28:26.724 --> 00:28:30.795
Today, supposing you say, "I was crashed down, I was finished,

00:28:30.795 --> 00:28:32.468
I have nothing in me to offer you."

00:28:32.468 --> 00:28:35.394
They’ll say, "Then what are you talking about, shut up!"

00:28:37.344 --> 00:28:41.257
But still, then, you have something to offer, in life.

00:28:42.444 --> 00:28:47.284
And what do you have to offer is that, “We are crashed because of this.”

00:28:47.944 --> 00:28:51.287
It will help so many people, you don’t know!

00:28:52.804 --> 00:28:56.206
But people will deny you if you say only that.

00:28:56.206 --> 00:29:00.814
But if you say, “No I was crashed but I am complete now.”

00:29:01.864 --> 00:29:05.604
But your being should announce that you are resurrected.

00:29:05.644 --> 00:29:11.324
On the contrary, if you are greedy, if you are still the same style now,

00:29:11.884 --> 00:29:14.633
they are not going to believe.

00:29:17.284 --> 00:29:22.454
So, Sahaja Yoga has given you that path by which you ascend.

00:29:23.424 --> 00:29:26.596
And when you ascend you can go on along,

00:29:26.596 --> 00:29:29.978
telling people, “Don’t fall! Don’t fall!

00:29:31.364 --> 00:29:35.909
If you fall, it’s difficult to ascend, as it has happened to us.

00:29:36.264 --> 00:29:41.214
So, don’t fall! There is a short circuit. Come to the short circuit.

00:29:42.724 --> 00:29:47.039
Your dharmas must be established, very necessary. "

00:29:47.464 --> 00:29:54.955
In the whole of these crashed societies,

00:29:54.955 --> 00:30:00.585
dharmas are to be established. What are we doing about it?

00:30:05.244 --> 00:30:10.841
In developing countries, they gather up their impurities

00:30:10.841 --> 00:30:15.027
by a wrong premise that they have.

00:30:15.844 --> 00:30:18.782
They think, "Oh, we must develop.

00:30:20.179 --> 00:30:23.304
We must have cars, we must have telephones."

00:30:23.598 --> 00:30:25.210
You see, the wole attention is,

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:30.098
"How effective you are as far as your material things are concerned."

00:30:30.424 --> 00:30:34.723
Which is, when they start getting rid of their poverty,

00:30:35.017 --> 00:30:39.760
they just forget why did they remove their poverty, for what?

00:30:40.944 --> 00:30:48.331
It would be like a bridegroom who has to be ready to be married.

00:30:48.864 --> 00:30:52.699
Then they dress him up, put a tie over there.

00:30:53.264 --> 00:30:55.264
Now he is ready to be married.

00:30:55.764 --> 00:30:57.653
He's married.

00:30:57.824 --> 00:31:02.224
Now the night has come, he has to meet his wife

00:31:02.518 --> 00:31:06.758
Still, he is carrying on with his dress, like a fool.

00:31:07.164 --> 00:31:11.207
Why did he marry? To love his wife.

00:31:11.764 --> 00:31:16.980
Like a fool he still is in his attire, proud of his outer things

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:20.224
that they have done to him, not understanding he has to meet her.

00:31:20.224 --> 00:31:22.224
We remove poverty for what?

00:31:22.224 --> 00:31:24.344
We remove all these problems for what?

00:31:24.344 --> 00:31:26.344
We develop for what?

00:31:26.344 --> 00:31:30.286
We develop so that our day-to-day life becomes easier

00:31:30.286 --> 00:31:32.840
and we have time for God,

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.999
we have time for meditation.
