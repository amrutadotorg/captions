00:00:08.856 --> 00:00:13.691
So, today, I want to tell you about purity.

00:00:17.299 --> 00:00:20.000
That is my name, 'nir',

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Nir-mala.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.482
’Ni’ means ‘no’; ’mala’ means ‘impure’.

00:00:25.482 --> 00:00:28.720
The one who has no impurities is Nirmala.

00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:32.046
and that’s one of the names of the Goddess also.

00:00:38.943 --> 00:00:45.920
Purity is a quality which is silent,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.735
it speaks in silence.

00:00:49.176 --> 00:00:54.176
It is one of the most non-aggressive activities.

00:00:57.748 --> 00:01:00.072
It probes into you.

00:01:00.808 --> 00:01:04.219
It doesn’t express in any way.

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:07.638
Even love may express: in words,

00:01:07.638 --> 00:01:09.373
it may express in action.

00:01:09.851 --> 00:01:15.251
But this is the one 
which is expressionless, the purity.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:22.465
And it washes off all that is impure.

00:01:26.716 --> 00:01:32.168
You cannot, by rationality understand

00:01:32.168 --> 00:01:34.863
how it works out.

00:01:35.591 --> 00:01:40.960
You have to feel it and know it,

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.786
that it is working out its process.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.470
It’s very delicate.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.131
Sometimes, it’s flooding also.

00:01:53.962 --> 00:01:59.510
But it is never shocking, never.

00:02:03.076 --> 00:02:06.820
When I say that,

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.876
you find the human ideas have become lob headed.

00:02:12.342 --> 00:02:14.887
When do we become lob headed?

00:02:14.887 --> 00:02:17.172
Means 'upside down'.

00:02:18.243 --> 00:02:22.132
When we are plunging into something.

00:02:23.126 --> 00:02:29.113
We are plunging into something where we are going to get destroyed.

00:02:30.658 --> 00:02:33.205
We are upside-down.

00:02:34.162 --> 00:02:37.098
This comes out of impurities,

00:02:37.098 --> 00:02:42.824
that you cannot see things correctly in their right perspective.

00:02:46.963 --> 00:02:52.833
So let us see what are the things which we think

00:02:53.864 --> 00:02:57.389
create impurities in us.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.825
They say it in two words, you see: lust and greed.

00:03:08.298 --> 00:03:15.477
In Sanskrit, they'll say: "kama [erostism], Kanaka [gold]"; 
woman and gold.

00:03:16.508 --> 00:03:21.564
But ‘woman’ doesn’t mean, ’Woman’ means ‘lust’

00:03:21.564 --> 00:03:27.039
and ‘greed’ means ‘gold’.

00:03:30.634 --> 00:03:37.115
Now let us see if really these are impure things,

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:41.781
or they create impurity in us,

00:03:44.342 --> 00:03:51.790
or why these two things have become the source of impurity to us?

00:03:57.717 --> 00:04:02.778
Because we do not understand the right perspective

00:04:02.778 --> 00:04:07.705
of matter and of sex.

00:04:08.624 --> 00:04:14.328
If we can understand them in right perspective,

00:04:15.248 --> 00:04:21.214
then these two become the source of happiness and joy to us.

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:30.865
For example, say, a tree, it has two sides:

00:04:31.353 --> 00:04:34.373
it has the shoot and the root.

00:04:34.373 --> 00:04:39.225
If the root becomes upward and the shoot becomes downward,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.430
it will not survive.

00:04:43.717 --> 00:04:48.243
The root has to go down into the earth

00:04:48.243 --> 00:04:51.375
and the shoot has to come up.

00:04:51.962 --> 00:04:58.279
The root has the capacity to suck in the liquids

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:01.950
that are inside the soil.

00:05:02.266 --> 00:05:05.906
Also, it has capacity to digest

00:05:05.906 --> 00:05:13.582
all the essential salts necessary for him.

00:05:14.429 --> 00:05:20.002
Supposing now the root starts malfunctioning

00:05:20.488 --> 00:05:25.129
and starts sucking the impurities

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.526
instead of the pure things that are needed

00:05:30.526 --> 00:05:34.275
 for the body of the tree.

00:05:34.697 --> 00:05:37.037
Then what will happen?

00:05:37.037 --> 00:05:40.095
There will be malnutrition

00:05:40.095 --> 00:05:42.372
and the tree will collapse.

00:05:42.835 --> 00:05:46.720
But the root has the wisdom to pick up

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.804
the necessary salts for its nourishment.

00:05:54.296 --> 00:05:59.671
This is where we must understand that

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.644
we do not have proper feelers

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.669
for our own nourishment

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:11.624
and we blame God, or we blame nature, we blame societies,

00:06:11.624 --> 00:06:16.809
we blame cultures, we blame our parents, we blame our governments,

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:19.723
we blame this and that.

00:06:21.269 --> 00:06:25.407
Because we have no feelers,

00:06:25.407 --> 00:06:30.256
we suck in that is impure,

00:06:31.261 --> 00:06:34.660
which will create more problems for us

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:40.000
than joy and happiness and nourishment.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.660
If the tree has to grow,

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:47.038
it should avoid all that is poisonous to it,

00:06:47.038 --> 00:06:49.710
all that is impure.

00:06:53.166 --> 00:06:55.162
And there could be two methods.

00:06:55.383 --> 00:06:58.631
If your rationality is that high graded,

00:06:58.631 --> 00:07:01.747
if your intelligence is of that calibre,

00:07:02.078 --> 00:07:09.820
you just deny all that, to your body, which is not good, to your spiritual body,

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:14.154
or to your mental body, or to your emotional body, or to your physical body.

00:07:14.154 --> 00:07:18.560
You just deny it, if you have that much of pure intelligence.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:24.730
But the intelligence has not reached that Divine strata yet.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:30.243
So we devise, compromise easily.

00:07:30.453 --> 00:07:35.133
But whom are you harming? You are harming yourself.

00:07:37.158 --> 00:07:41.045
We go on collecting impurities very fast.

00:07:44.059 --> 00:07:47.339
And that’s what I call, is the human freedom:

00:07:47.707 --> 00:07:50.453
if he wants he can collect impurities.

00:07:50.655 --> 00:07:54.552
A tree is not. It will not collect impurities.

00:07:57.012 --> 00:07:59.441
but if impurities invade it,

00:07:59.441 --> 00:08:02.756
it will die, it cannot protect either.

00:08:02.756 --> 00:08:05.581
Human beings have a freedom to choose.

00:08:05.581 --> 00:08:11.030
Also they have the power to protect

00:08:13.202 --> 00:08:19.302
from the new impurities. And Sahaja Yogis, 
as you know, have much more powers.

00:08:23.302 --> 00:08:29.574
So our roots have to go down, into what? Into dharma,

00:08:29.574 --> 00:08:33.966
into sustaining power of love.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:40.719
If that is weak, then the roots are taken off

00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:44.408
and such people are uprooted.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:53.261
In the traditions, in the historical mistakes and errors of our elders,

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.530
we can see what mistakes they have done and learn from them,

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:07.400
and avoid the impurities that they had and [that] destroyed themselves.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:12.738
We can see in big empires fell, crashed, in no time.

00:09:12.738 --> 00:09:16.426
Why? What did they do?

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.080
We are not going to do that.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.707
But so far I've not known any nation that sits down

00:09:23.707 --> 00:09:27.426
and gets a comprehensive look of the whole picture:

00:09:27.426 --> 00:09:31.080
Why that nation has fallen down? Why these ones destroyed themselves?

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.460
So far, I have not known any political leader of that type.

00:09:35.755 --> 00:09:37.755
They’ll do patchwork,

00:09:37.755 --> 00:09:42.040
but none of them sit down to see why the whole sky collapsed,

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.077
what happened to those people

00:09:45.077 --> 00:09:50.000
who enjoyed so much of power once upon a time, suddenly collapsed.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:56.440
If somebody could sit down like that then he would see that they sucked in the impurities.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:03.046
Now how do you suck impurities?

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:10.000
You suck them because your feelers become blunt.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.192
When your feelers are blunt,

00:10:14.192 --> 00:10:18.010
you don’t know what you are sucking.

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:25.380
It only is possible when you are lob-headed, is the word.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:38.973
In the beginning, the body, the mind resist to all that is impure,

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.568
in most of the cases I would say.

00:10:43.568 --> 00:10:45.720
Some of the devils if they are born,

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:50.455
they may be children but their filths are exceptional. 

00:10:50.455 --> 00:10:56.127
But most of the human beings are born in innocence

00:10:56.127 --> 00:10:58.960
and they resist.

00:11:00.481 --> 00:11:07.372
Gradually you start making your feelers damaged

00:11:08.256 --> 00:11:12.178
and then the impurity starts coming in.

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:21.447
All these things start, people say, from desire,

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:23.887
clearly:

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:32.463
desire to be the king, desire to be most beautiful person,

00:11:32.463 --> 00:11:35.475
desire to be leader of the whole world,

00:11:35.475 --> 00:11:41.780
desire to eat, desire to have, possess — all desires.

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:49.100
But here also, I would say, is an impurity.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:57.640
Desire in all of these things is reaching the point that is joy. 

00:11:58.391 --> 00:12:01.941
We desire the joy. 

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:09.940
The desire for joy, if you keep it pure, then "You go on,  you get it".

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.520
No. This is not the way that gives joy.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.883
This is not the thing that gives joy. We can see it around us.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:24.999
Those who are seeking money, you should go  and see if they reach it. 

00:12:25.305 --> 00:12:30.585
You will know they are not people who have joy, obviously.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:40.525
And when you go to people who are in joy and in tranquility,

00:12:40.966 --> 00:12:45.186
you find they are talking of something else!

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:59.640
When we have accepted the desire as something wrong

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:04.698
we also negate the ultimate desire.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:14.625
But the essence, you know, 'swa'. We call the essence as 'swa'. ‘Swa’ means 'Self'.

00:13:15.405 --> 00:13:20.000
Essence of everything is that:

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.840
If you want to have a beautiful tree in front of your house,

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.600
the desire is to be joyous.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:32.140
What does a tree matter to you, if it does not give you joy?

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:37.133
It's like anything in the world as you know. 

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:52.340
That joy, that essence of everything, if it is kept pure,

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:57.700
then it’s nourishing you.

00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:03.850
Like the tree roots embed themselves in the Mother soil

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:10.000
and suck the beauties of the Mother soil, 

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.350
the essence of Mother, that is meant for nourishing

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.531
 and enrich themselves.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:24.860
But that doesn't mean by any chance, by any luring

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:29.632
that you lose your character or individuality — you do not.

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:33.660
You see, a mango tree will be a mango tree.

00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:37.733
A banana tree will be a banana tree.

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:43.597
Because the outside is different,

00:14:43.597 --> 00:14:45.856
the inside is the same.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:52.490
And in every country the Mother Earth has its own varieties:

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:57.173
accordingly, you will have trees, you will have plants.

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:00.980
You cannot have mango in England.

00:15:01.201 --> 00:15:07.986
But you cannot have say, a birch tree in India.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.898
But it makes no difference as long as they are fully nourished.

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:21.698
So, your character is not lost, your individuality is not lost.

00:15:21.989 --> 00:15:24.779
On the contrary it’s made better.

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:30.000
In its purest form, every character is beautiful.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:36.188
Every religion, in its purest form, is the seed of God,

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:41.826
are the different facets of one diamond, that is God.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:47.709
They have to be there. And whatever angle you go, you see them sparkling.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.728
At every angle, they sparkle.

00:15:50.728 --> 00:15:53.022
A diamond sparkles at every angle.

00:15:53.089 --> 00:15:58.389
Because it has got its own character,

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.492
unique variety and its different forms.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:08.745
So, the essential unity between them is through the sap which is running.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:16.259
If our attention is on that purity of oneness

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:23.515
then so many of other impurities that have cropped up within us, will also come out.

00:16:24.696 --> 00:16:31.407
The other impurity we suffer from, is loss of collectiveness.

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:37.404
We don’t mind wearing the same dresses all over the world.

00:16:37.404 --> 00:16:41.141
If a jeans starts, all of the places you go, even in Japan,

00:16:41.141 --> 00:16:46.220
you'll go to Australia, you'll go to, even to China communist countries,

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:49.236
anywhere, the jean everyone is wearing.

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:55.962
But the essential unity within us in its purest form, nowhere.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:03.637
Of course, these feelers you develop after Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:07.295
But if you have failed in your dharmas,

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.540
that’s the base, it's the root,

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:13.868
if we do not have those roots properly done,

00:17:13.868 --> 00:17:17.115
then the tree cannot stand. It is necessary.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:21.269
Of course, the incarnation is just the opposite of that.

00:17:21.269 --> 00:17:23.123
His roots are in the heavens.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.177
He flowers on the tree.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:32.403
An incarnation does not break its dharma

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.934
— it is dharma.

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.812
He does not need. He’s dharmateet. He’s beyond dharma.

00:17:40.812 --> 00:17:45.112
Whatever he does is the religion of the whole world!

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.913
Nothing touches Him.

00:17:49.318 --> 00:17:52.975
His roots are in the Divine,

00:17:52.975 --> 00:17:56.725
only the Divine Force. There’s no question of impurity in them,

00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:02.380
no question of clearing them or bathing them.

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.680
Because he is in the Divine force

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.743
and he’s sucking that out and giving it to you.

00:18:07.743 --> 00:18:10.732
He’s flowering on the tree, it’s upside-down tree,

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.415
embedded in you.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:20.806
So, for an incarnation there is no dharma. He's beyond dharma,

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.342
He’s ‘gunateet’. He is beyond all moods [gunas]. 

00:18:24.342 --> 00:18:26.878
He’s beyond everything.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.640
But human beings have to sustain their dharma,

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:40.000
then rise, rise beyond themselves

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.047
into collective consciousness.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:51.138
And when they turn upside-down, they become incarnations.

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:54.195
It's possible.

00:18:54.195 --> 00:18:58.624
Two persons have done that so far: Buddha and Mahavira,

00:18:58.624 --> 00:19:01.402
you can call them as Deities.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.451
Only these two persons have done it.

00:19:04.451 --> 00:19:09.676
And in Sahaja Yoga, if we do that, we might be incarnations,

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:17.335
when our roots will be in the Divinity.

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.624
Here you have to choose.

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.646
Still the freedom of choice exists for you.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.866
For Me there is no freedom at all.

00:19:27.866 --> 00:19:30.186
I cannot choose the impurity.

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:34.333
That’s why I say I have no temptations.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:38.615
I have no sense of possession. I'm planned. 

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:43.584
So, the choice doesn’t exist for Me at all, of anything.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:46.670
I have no time and space.

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:50.740
I am spaceless. I am timeless,

00:19:51.698 --> 00:19:56.864
because my roots are in my being.

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:04.172
But even to have the blossom within yourself

00:20:04.356 --> 00:20:06.912
and for others to enjoy,

00:20:06.912 --> 00:20:13.042
even to nourish yourself, you have to have your dharma properly nourrished.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:18.365
So, we come to the question of lust and greed.

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:31.685
Lust and greed are to be seen in this light.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.260
Are we lusty of God?

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.800
Are we greedy of His wealth?

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:47.745
If you ask such a question, then you see the purity.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:56.669
We waste so much time thinking about greed and lust,

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:10.641
but very little time we have to think of this essential desire.

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:17.143
Now, there are two types of things,

00:21:17.143 --> 00:21:21.874
one that is of a human being and one of an incarnation.

00:21:22.095 --> 00:21:28.387
That’s why the behaviour of incarnations cannot determine the behaviour of human beings.

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:32.145
This is a very big mistake we have been always committing.

00:21:32.366 --> 00:21:34.366
And please beware:

00:21:34.881 --> 00:21:38.180
you cannot be incarnations now,

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:44.442
and you should not determine your behaviour according to the behaviour of an incarnation.

00:21:44.736 --> 00:21:47.696
Because an incarnation is above all these things.

00:21:48.618 --> 00:21:52.107
It’s a different thing altogether, as I told you.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:59.595
A tree must take its nourishment, or be embedded in the Divine.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:03.297
You have to rise, still, to that stage,

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:07.129
where your seeds might go into that.

00:22:07.424 --> 00:22:12.744
And maybe the trees will go and inform the Divine towards that.

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:20.426
So, the pattern of life that is followed by an incarnation

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:27.852
is always followed and that’s why false religions fail.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:33.960
For example, we’ll say, "Christ took a hunter in his hand and started lashing at people

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:37.405
beating them when they were selling God".

00:22:37.405 --> 00:22:40.333
I feel the same way and I am doing it.

00:22:40.591 --> 00:22:44.571
If you read Kabir, you will find he’s slashing at all these people.

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:50.000
If you read Mohammad sahib, he has criticised them.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:55.925
But you are not the incarnation.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.023
You are not incarnations

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:03.387
in you, when you have those impurities.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:08.540
Because what I see, that human beings nurture them within themselves

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.542
and they like to see the drama in that.

00:23:11.542 --> 00:23:14.693
For example, they’ll go to a picture of a drama

00:23:15.208 --> 00:23:18.689
and they’ll see a cruel man, hitting someone.

00:23:19.278 --> 00:23:22.318
And they say, "What a cruel man! He is horrid!"

00:23:22.318 --> 00:23:25.360
But they don’t know that cruelty they share into themselves.

00:23:26.192 --> 00:23:31.768
They want to call others cruel, but not the cruelty that exists within them.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.580
You see, as far as others are concerned they become a witness.

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:40.208
But as far as they are concerned, they are not.

00:23:40.208 --> 00:23:44.558
If they could be, if they could be a witness to themselves,

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:49.121
if they could see themselves, then what would happen,

00:23:49.121 --> 00:23:54.880
 that their purifying forces within them would start

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.880
- specially for Sahaja Yogis -

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.000
because it has opened now, the tap is open,

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:02.508
the Spirit is emitting just now.

00:24:02.508 --> 00:24:08.340
Only you see where it is within you, with your attention inward, in your being.

00:24:08.855 --> 00:24:12.777
Just put it within you! Do not justify it by saying,

00:24:13.035 --> 00:24:17.275
"My society is bad. My parents are bad. This happened.

00:24:17.275 --> 00:24:20.522
Because of this, it has happened, because ..." No!

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:26.659
They are there because you are harbouring them.

00:24:26.659 --> 00:24:31.160
In others, you can see clearly, but in yourself, you cannot see.

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:35.695
That is what a human mind is: it's a very funny mind,

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:39.290
which is been evolved that way.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.146
You read a book, for example if you read somebody’s book:

00:24:44.146 --> 00:24:49.881
immediately, you are identified with the hero and never with the villain.

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:54.853
We don’t know, the villain is much more there than hero, inside, you see.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.554
It’s a common thing I have seen with human beings, you see.

00:24:58.554 --> 00:25:03.332
I have now learnt through many lives and this one what a human being is.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.220
Just the opposite is again with an incarnation.

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:10.000
Just the opposite is an incarnation.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.725
You see, supposing you have a problem within yourselves,

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:20.000
immediately, I try to see in myself where the problem lies.

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.217
In my own vastness, I correct it and you get it

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:27.330
because you are my body.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:32.020
You are within Me, all Sahaja Yogis are within Me,

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:35.160
which I search and find out

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:42.580
That’s how I do it. And unless and until I do it, I don’t feel all right, you have seen that.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:46.776
My problems are very different from yours.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:53.189
So, we have to pay attention to ourselves.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:57.520
But attention in a way which is very pure wisdom,

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:02.002
 is a deeper attention, it's not superficial.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:06.060
One should learn to go deep into yourself and see,

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:09.347
"Are we cruel people?"

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:12.679
"Am I cruel? I don't know. 

00:26:12.722 --> 00:26:15.620
Which part of mine is cruel?"

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:19.960
"Which part of mine is harming others?”

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.716
Now this boy who came, he wouldn’t take out his socks

00:26:22.716 --> 00:26:25.205
because he thought there was a smell of it.

00:26:25.205 --> 00:26:27.205
Are we fragrant ourselves?

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:32.950
Are we considerate about it that we are equally fragrant?

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.873
It’s a silent process,

00:26:35.873 --> 00:26:39.140
it’s a stillness inside of you, acting.

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:44.663
And this has to be there.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:50.000
And because, as I said, in the Western countries, you see, they are crashed people,

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:56.620
 it is much more necessary for you people to work harder,

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:58.700
than the people who are yet to crash down.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:02.559
They are about to, most of them are coming behind you.

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:07.892
And you have to announce with a horn, “Now don’t crash!

00:27:07.892 --> 00:27:10.999
"We have crashed". That you have to do.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.560
That’s very important.

00:27:13.891 --> 00:27:16.964
Any man who has any consideration,

00:27:16.964 --> 00:27:19.451
any feeling for others,

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:25.888
if he gets hurt by a stone on his way

00:27:26.366 --> 00:27:29.797
he’ll immediately stand there and say, “Oh, there’s a stone here, now go.

00:27:29.797 --> 00:27:32.686
Be careful, don’t topple here. Be careful."

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:38.000
When we are hurt by certain foolishness and stupidities,

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.871
or you can say even the impurities that we have assembled within ourselves,

00:27:42.871 --> 00:27:46.551
you see, our own egoistical pursuits,

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:51.781
let us announce to the world that, “We have been foolish. We have done it.

00:27:51.781 --> 00:27:54.808
We are broken people, we have broken our hands, we have broken our heads,

00:27:54.808 --> 00:27:57.579
we have broken our chakras. Now you don’t,

00:27:57.579 --> 00:28:01.544
for heaven’s sake you don’t!” Because they are following you.

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:08.998
They think you are going on an ascent. They don’t know you have had enough of it.

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:12.847
In every way possible, you have to announce it.

00:28:12.847 --> 00:28:16.984
But the announcement is expected by people.

00:28:16.984 --> 00:28:21.433
You see, it's such a funny world to be a perfect person.

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:27.783
So, they want also your ascent.

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.080
This is what the world is, you see.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:35.151
Today, supposing you say, "I was crashed down, I was finished,

00:28:35.151 --> 00:28:36.824
I have nothing in me to offer you."

00:28:36.824 --> 00:28:39.750
They’ll say, "Then what are you talking about, shut up!"

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:45.613
But still, then, you have something to offer, in life.

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:51.640
And what do you have to offer is that, “We are crashed because of this.”

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:55.643
It will help so many people, you don’t know!

00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:00.562
But people will deny you if you say only that.

00:29:00.562 --> 00:29:05.170
But if you say, “No I was crashed but I am complete now.”

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:09.960
But your being should announce that you are resurrected.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.680
On the contrary, if you are greedy, if you are still the same style now,

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.989
they are not going to believe.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:26.810
So, Sahaja Yoga has given you that path by which you ascend.

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:30.952
And when you ascend you can go on along,

00:29:30.952 --> 00:29:34.334
telling people, “Don’t fall! Don’t fall!

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:40.265
If you fall, it’s difficult to ascend, as it has happened to us.

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:45.570
So, don’t fall! There is a short circuit. Come to the short circuit.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:51.395
Your dharmas must be established, very necessary. "

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:59.311
In the whole of these crashed societies,

00:29:59.311 --> 00:30:04.941
dharmas are to be established. What are we doing about it?

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:15.197
In developing countries, they gather up their impurities

00:30:15.197 --> 00:30:19.383
by a wrong premise that they have.

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.138
They think, "Oh, we must develop.

00:30:24.535 --> 00:30:27.660
We must have cars, we must have telephones."

00:30:27.954 --> 00:30:29.566
You see, the wole attention is,

00:30:29.566 --> 00:30:34.454
"How effective you are as far as your material things are concerned."

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:39.079
Which is, when they start getting rid of their poverty,

00:30:39.373 --> 00:30:44.116
they just forget why did they remove their poverty, for what?

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:52.687
It would be like a bridegroom who has to be ready to be married.

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:57.055
Then they dress him up, put a tie over there.

00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:59.620
Now he is ready to be married.

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.009
He's married.

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:06.580
Now the night has come, he has to meet his wife

00:31:06.874 --> 00:31:11.114
Still, he is carrying on with his dress, like a fool.

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:15.563
Why did he marry? To love his wife.

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:21.336
Like a fool he still is in his attire, proud of his outer things

00:31:21.336 --> 00:31:24.580
that they have done to him, not understanding he has to meet her.

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:26.580
We remove poverty for what?

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:28.700
We remove all these problems for what?

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:30.700
We develop for what?

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:34.642
We develop so that our day-to-day life becomes easier

00:31:34.642 --> 00:31:37.196
and we have time for God,

00:31:37.196 --> 00:31:39.355
we have time for meditation.
