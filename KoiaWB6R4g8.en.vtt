00:04.180 --> 00:09.420
So today I want to tell you about purity.

00:13.460 --> 00:15.540
That is my name, you know that,

00:15.540 --> 00:17.540
Nir-mala.

00:17.540 --> 00:20.240
’Ni’ means ‘no’; ’mala’ means ‘impurities’

00:21.240 --> 00:24.980
The one who has no impurities is Nirmala.

00:24.980 --> 00:27.260
and that’s one of the names of Goddess.

00:35.040 --> 00:43.640
Purity is a quality which is silent, it speaks in silence.

00:45.200 --> 00:49.280
It is one of the most non-aggressive activities.

00:53.080 --> 00:55.580
It probes into you.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.580
It doesn’t express in any way.

00:59.580 --> 01:04.400
Even love may express: in words, it may express in action.

01:05.580 --> 01:10.060
But this is the one which is expressionless, the purity.

01:11.720 --> 01:17.900
And it washes off all that is impurity.

01:22.740 --> 01:30.040
You cannot, by rationality, understand how it works out.

01:32.020 --> 01:40.960
You have to feel it and know it, that it is working out its process.

01:43.980 --> 01:48.660
It’s very delicate. Sometimes, it’s flooding also.

01:50.420 --> 01:54.760
But is never shocking, never.

02:00.020 --> 02:06.820
When I say that, I find the human ideas have become lob-headed (sic).

02:07.960 --> 02:14.040
When do we become lob-headed, means upside down?

02:14.300 --> 02:24.400
When we are plunging into something. We are plunging into something where we are going to get destroyed.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.940
We are upside-down.

02:29.860 --> 02:38.480
This comes out of impurities, that you cannot see things directly in their right perspective.

02:43.060 --> 02:51.940
So let us see what are the things which we think create impurities in us.

02:56.960 --> 03:02.260
They say it in two words, you see: lust and greed.

03:04.840 --> 03:10.580
In Sanskrit they will say kala (gold) and kama: woman and gold.

03:12.100 --> 03:22.400
But ‘woman’ doesn’t mean [woman]. ’Woman’ means ‘lust’ and ‘greed’ means ‘gold’.

03:26.400 --> 03:32.660
Now let us see if really these are impurities

03:32.660 --> 03:36.480
or they create impurity in us,

03:40.660 --> 03:47.040
or why these two things have become the source of impurity to us?

03:54.440 --> 04:03.140
Because we do not understand the right perspective of matter and of sex.

04:04.500 --> 04:16.720
If we can understand them in right perspective then these two become the source of happiness and joy to us.

04:19.720 --> 04:26.300
For example, say, a tree, it has two sides:

04:27.340 --> 04:30.360
it has the shoot and the root.

04:30.360 --> 04:38.120
If the root becomes upward and the shoot becomes downward, it will not survive.

04:39.740 --> 04:45.960
The root has to go down into the earth and the shoot has to come up.

04:47.620 --> 04:56.880
The root has the capacity to suck in the liquids that are inside the soil.

04:58.400 --> 05:08.280
Also it has capacity to digest all the essential salts necessary for the tree.

05:10.280 --> 05:15.800
Supposing now the root starts malfunctioning

05:16.020 --> 05:28.980
and starts sucking the impurities instead of the pure things that are needed for the body of the tree,

05:30.720 --> 05:33.060
then what will happen?

05:33.060 --> 05:37.460
There will be malnutrition and the tree will collapse.

05:37.460 --> 05:46.760
But the root has the wisdom to pick up the necessary salts for its nourishment.

05:50.480 --> 06:02.480
This is where we must understand that we do not have proper feelers for our own nourishment

06:03.120 --> 06:14.120
and we blame God, or we blame nature, we blame society, we blame cultures, we blame our parents, we blame our governments, we blame this and that.

06:17.220 --> 06:24.660
Because we have no feelers we suck in that [which] is impure,

06:26.880 --> 06:35.640
which will create more problems for us than joy and happiness and nourishment.

06:36.820 --> 06:38.720
If the tree has to grow

06:38.720 --> 06:45.160
t should avoid all that is poisonous to it, all that is impure.

06:49.040 --> 06:51.260
And there could be two methods.

06:51.260 --> 06:54.140
If your rationality is that high graded,

06:54.140 --> 06:57.040
if your intelligence is of that high calibre,

06:57.760 --> 07:03.440
you just deny all that to your body which is not good,

07:03.440 --> 07:09.820
to your spiritual body, or to your mental body, or to your emotional body, or to your physical body.

07:09.820 --> 07:16.200
You’ll just deny it, if you have that much of pure intelligence.

07:16.200 --> 07:20.180
But the intelligence has not reached that Divine strata yet,

07:20.180 --> 07:25.420
So we devise compromises easily.

07:25.520 --> 07:30.200
But whom are you harming? You are harming yourself.

07:32.900 --> 07:35.720
We go on collecting impurities very fast.

07:39.720 --> 07:43.000
And that’s what I call the human freedom:

07:43.840 --> 07:46.440
if he wants he can collect impurities.

07:46.440 --> 07:47.820
A tree is such

07:48.380 --> 07:50.760
It will not collect impurities.

07:52.760 --> 07:58.360
but if impurities invade it, it will die, it cannot protect [itself] either.

07:58.360 --> 08:01.320
Human beings have a freedom to choose.

08:01.360 --> 08:11.140
Also they have the power to protect from the new impurities.

08:11.140 --> 08:14.700
And Sahaja Yogis, as you know, have much more powers.

08:19.060 --> 08:24.580
So our roots have to go down, into what?  Into dharma,

08:24.580 --> 08:28.420
into sustaining power of love.

08:30.900 --> 08:39.340
If that is weak, then the roots are taken off and such people are uprooted.

08:41.900 --> 08:49.040
In the traditions, in the historical mistakes and errors of our elders,

08:50.800 --> 08:54.020
we can see what mistakes they have done and learn from them,

08:58.020 --> 09:03.400
and avoid the impurities that they had and destroyed themselves.

09:03.400 --> 09:10.020
We can see in big empires fell, crashed, in no time. Why?

09:10.020 --> 09:11.800
What did they do?

09:13.080 --> 09:15.080
We are not going to do that.

09:15.580 --> 09:23.080
But so far I've not known any nation that sits down and gets a comprehensive look of the whole picture:

09:23.080 --> 09:25.080
Why that nation has fallen down?

09:25.080 --> 09:27.080
Why these ones destroyed themselves?

09:27.760 --> 09:31.460
So far I have not known any political leader of that type.

09:31.460 --> 09:33.460
They’ll do patchwork,

09:33.460 --> 09:37.340
but none of them sit down to see why the whole sky collapsed

09:38.360 --> 09:44.600
[or] what happened to those people who enjoyed so much of power once upon a time, suddenly collapsed.

09:46.400 --> 09:52.440
If somebody could sit down like that they would see that they sucked in the impurities.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.800
Now how do you suck impurities?

10:00.620 --> 10:04.920
You suck them because your feelers become blunt.

10:06.920 --> 10:12.280
When your feelers are blunt you don’t know what you are sucking.

10:15.020 --> 10:21.380
It only is possible when you are lob-headed, is the word, is like this.

10:24.840 --> 10:33.500
In the beginning the body, the mind resist to all that is impure,

10:37.460 --> 10:39.200
in most of the cases I would say

10:39.200 --> 10:41.720
Some of the devils if they are born,

10:41.720 --> 10:46.160
they may be children but they are exceptions

10:46.160 --> 10:54.960
to this — but most of the human beings are born in innocence and they resist.

10:56.960 --> 11:07.000
Gradually you start making your feelers damaged and then the impurity starts coming in.

11:10.780 --> 11:16.600
All these things start, people say, from desire,

11:17.980 --> 11:19.040
clearly:

11:22.580 --> 11:27.800
desire to be the king, desire to be most beautiful person,

11:27.800 --> 11:31.180
desire to be leader of the whole world,

11:31.180 --> 11:36.160
desire to eat, desire to have, possess — all desires.

11:40.580 --> 11:45.100
But here also, I would say, is an impurity.

11:46.920 --> 11:53.640
of desire in you. And in all of these things is the inner point, and that is joy:

11:54.980 --> 11:57.720
we desire for joy.

12:00.820 --> 12:05.940
The desire for joy, if you keep it pure, then you go and you get it:

12:05.940 --> 12:08.520
“So this is not the thing that gives joy.

12:08.520 --> 12:11.220
This is not the thing that gives joy.” We can see around.

12:12.880 --> 12:17.280
Those who are seeking money you should go and see them,

12:18.740 --> 12:20.200
do they reach joy?

12:20.200 --> 12:25.480
You will know they are not the people who have joy among us.

12:30.740 --> 12:35.420
And when you go to people who are in joy and in tranquility,

12:35.420 --> 12:39.640
you will find they are talking of something else.

12:44.500 --> 12:54.720
When we have accepted the desire as something wrong

12:56.180 --> 12:58.820
we also negate the ultimate desire.

13:02.240 --> 13:09.520
But the essence, you know, swa. We call the essence as swa. ‘Swa’ means self.

13:11.920 --> 13:15.300
The essence of everything is that:

13:16.800 --> 13:20.840
If you want to have a beautiful tree in front of your house,

13:20.840 --> 13:22.840
the desire is to be joyous.

13:23.600 --> 13:28.140
What does a tree matter to you if it does not give you joy?

13:28.140 --> 13:32.360
It’s anything in the world I will give you:

13:38.420 --> 13:48.340
That joy, that essence of everything, if it is kept pure,

13:50.340 --> 13:53.700
then it’s nourishing you.

13:53.700 --> 13:59.440
Like the tree roots embed themselves in the Mother soil and suck

14:04.140 --> 14:08.840
the beauties of the Mother soil, the essence of Mother, that is meant for nourishing

14:10.500 --> 14:12.500
you, and enrich themselves.

14:16.280 --> 14:20.860
But that does not mean by any chance

14:20.860 --> 14:25.080
that you lose your character or individuality — you do not.

14:25.080 --> 14:28.960
A mango tree will be a mango tree,

14:30.400 --> 14:32.960
a banana tree will be a banana.

14:35.980 --> 14:41.120
Because the outside is different, but inside is the same.

14:42.860 --> 14:52.400
And in every country the Mother Earth has its own varieties: accordingly you will have trees, you will have plants.

14:53.820 --> 14:56.980
You cannot have mango in England.

14:56.980 --> 15:02.440
But you cannot have a birch tree in India.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.720
But [it] makes no difference as long as they are truly nourished.

15:12.780 --> 15:20.080
So your character is not lost, your individuality is not lost. On the contrary it’s made better.

15:21.220 --> 15:25.660
In its purest form, every character is beautiful.

15:26.740 --> 15:31.120
Every religion in its purest form is the seat of God,

15:32.460 --> 15:37.200
and the different facets of one diamond that is God.

15:38.440 --> 15:43.120
They have to be there. And whatever angle you go, you see them sparkling.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.360
At every angle, they sparkle.

15:46.360 --> 15:48.500
A diamond sparkles at every angle.

15:48.500 --> 15:53.800
Because it has got its own character,

15:54.640 --> 15:57.940
unique variety and its different forms.

15:58.960 --> 16:03.640
So the essential unity between them is through the sap which is running.

16:05.440 --> 16:10.860
If our attention is on that purity of oneness

16:12.660 --> 16:17.380
then so many of other impurities that have cropped up within us, will also come out.

16:20.880 --> 16:25.640
The other impurity you suffer from is loss of collectiveness.

16:29.940 --> 16:36.720
We don’t mind wearing the same dresses all over the world. If a jeans starts, all of the places you go, even in Japan,

16:36.720 --> 16:40.360
you'll go to Australia, you'll go to, even to China

16:40.360 --> 16:44.500
communist countries, anywhere, the jean everyone is wearing.

16:45.820 --> 16:49.900
But the essential unity within us in its purest form, nowhere.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.980
Of course these feelers you develop after Sahaj Yoga.

16:59.980 --> 17:02.080
But if you are failed in your dharmas,

17:03.540 --> 17:05.540
that’s the base, it's the root,

17:05.540 --> 17:11.080
if we do not have those roots properly done, then the tree cannot stand.

17:11.080 --> 17:12.820
It is necessary.

17:13.560 --> 17:18.460
Of course, the incarnation is just the opposite of that: His roots are in the heavens.

17:19.680 --> 17:21.220
He flowers on the body.

17:23.940 --> 17:26.820
An incarnation does not break its dharma

17:30.440 --> 17:31.940
— it is dharma.

17:33.940 --> 17:36.260
He does not need, He’s dharmateet, He’s beyond dharma.

17:36.260 --> 17:39.860
Whatever He does is the religion of the whole world!

17:41.860 --> 17:48.660
Nothing touches Him. His roots are in the Divine,

17:48.660 --> 17:52.320
only the Divine Force. There’s no question of impurity in them,

17:53.020 --> 17:58.380
no question of clearing them or bathing them

17:58.380 --> 18:00.680
because he is in the Divine force

18:00.680 --> 18:04.320
and He’s sucking that out and giving it to you. He’s flowering

18:04.320 --> 18:06.180
on this Earth, it’s upside down flower,

18:07.200 --> 18:09.200
embedded in you.

18:12.260 --> 18:15.980
So for an incarnation there is no dharma, he's beyond dharma,

18:17.160 --> 18:19.700
he’s gunateet, he is beyond all moods [gunas]

18:19.700 --> 18:21.700
He’s beyond everything

18:23.480 --> 18:26.640
But human beings have to first develop their dharma,

18:28.640 --> 18:35.200
then rise, rise beyond themselves

18:37.200 --> 18:39.200
into collective consciousness.

18:40.560 --> 18:45.260
And when they turn upside down they become incarnations.

18:47.860 --> 18:51.540
It's possible. Two persons have done that

18:52.920 --> 18:56.960
so far: Buddha and Mahavira you can call them as Deities.

18:57.980 --> 19:04.240
Only these two persons have done it. And in Sahaj Yoga, if we do that, we might be incarnations.

19:08.960 --> 19:12.820
when our roots will be in the Divinity.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.740
Here you have to choose,

19:17.520 --> 19:20.020
till the freedom of choice exists within you.

19:21.080 --> 19:23.240
For Me there is no freedom at all.

19:23.240 --> 19:25.560
I cannot choose the impurity.

19:27.340 --> 19:29.560
That’s why I say I have no temptations.

19:30.840 --> 19:33.400
I have no sense of possession.

19:35.400 --> 19:38.700
So the choice doesn’t exist at all for Me at all, of anything.

19:39.860 --> 19:41.860
I have no time and space.

19:41.860 --> 19:46.740
I am spaceless. I am timeless,

19:46.740 --> 19:48.740
because

19:48.740 --> 19:51.220
my roots are in my being.

19:55.220 --> 19:58.920
But even to have the blossom within yourself

19:58.920 --> 20:02.360
and for others to enjoy,

20:02.360 --> 20:08.220
even to nourish yourself, have to have your dharma properly established.

20:10.220 --> 20:13.260
So we come to the question of lust and greed.

20:15.660 --> 20:26.360
Lust and greed are to be seen in this light.

20:29.360 --> 20:32.260
Are we lusty of God?

20:32.260 --> 20:35.100
Are we greedy of His wealth?

20:39.100 --> 20:42.640
If you ask such a question, then you see the purity.

20:46.140 --> 20:51.380
We waste so much time thinking about greed and lust,

20:58.860 --> 21:04.800
but very little time we have to think of this essential desire.

21:09.220 --> 21:17.360
Now, there are two types of things, one is that of a human being and one of an incarnation.

21:17.360 --> 21:23.540
That’s why the behaviour of incarnations cannot determine the behaviour of human beings.

21:24.900 --> 21:27.740
This is a very big mistake we have been always committing.

21:27.740 --> 21:29.740
And please beware:

21:29.740 --> 21:34.180
you cannot be incarnations now,

21:34.180 --> 21:40.000
and you should not determine your behaviour according to the behaviour of an incarnation.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.960
Because an incarnation is above all these things.

21:44.360 --> 21:46.880
It’s a different thing altogether, as I told you.

21:48.880 --> 21:55.080
A tree must take its nourishment, or be embedded in the Divine.

21:55.920 --> 21:58.340
You have to rise still to that stage.

21:59.700 --> 22:02.540
Where your seats might go into that.

22:02.540 --> 22:07.860
And maybe the trees will go and inform the Divine towards that.

22:10.500 --> 22:14.420
So the patterns of life that are followed by an incarnation

22:17.400 --> 22:22.600
is always followed and that’s why false religions fail.

22:24.240 --> 22:29.960
For example, we’ll see [that] Christ took a hunter in his hand and started lashing at people

22:29.960 --> 22:33.000
beating them when they were selling God.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.560
I feel the same way and I am doing it.

22:36.260 --> 22:39.320
If you read Kabir you will find he’s slashing at all these people.

22:41.320 --> 22:44.320
If you read Mohammad saheb He has criticised them.

22:46.740 --> 22:49.900
But you are not the incarnation.

22:52.680 --> 22:54.360
You are not incarnations.

22:55.340 --> 22:58.540
In you when you have those impurities

22:59.720 --> 23:03.840
because what I see, that human beings nurture them within themselves

23:04.800 --> 23:07.100
and they like to see the drama in that.

23:07.100 --> 23:10.040
For example, say they’ll go to a picture of a drama

23:10.040 --> 23:14.100
and they’ll see a cruel man hitting someone.

23:14.100 --> 23:17.140
And they say, “What a cruel man! He is horrid!”

23:17.760 --> 23:21.360
But they don’t know that that cruelty they share within themselves.

23:21.860 --> 23:26.700
They want to call others cruel, but not the cruelty that exists within them.

23:29.660 --> 23:33.580
As far as others are concerned they become a witness,

23:33.580 --> 23:35.840
but as far as they are concerned they are not.

23:35.840 --> 23:39.380
If they could be, if they could be a witness to themselves,

23:40.880 --> 23:43.280
if they could see themselves,

23:43.280 --> 23:50.880
then what would happen is that their purifying forces within them would start

23:50.880 --> 23:52.880
— specially for Sahaj Yogis,

23:52.880 --> 23:55.580
because it has opened now, the tap is open,

23:56.540 --> 23:58.140
the Spirit is emitting just now.

23:58.140 --> 24:04.340
If only you see where it is within you, with your attention in your being.

24:04.340 --> 24:07.820
You just put it within you! Do not justify it by saying:

24:07.820 --> 24:15.380
“My society is bad! My parents are bad! This happened,” “Because of this it has happened.” No!

24:19.080 --> 24:22.180
They are there because you are harbouring them.

24:22.180 --> 24:25.600
In others you can see clearly, but in yourself you cannot see.

24:27.160 --> 24:30.480
That is what a human mind is: is a very funny mind,

24:32.480 --> 24:34.480
which is been evolved that way.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.520
You read a book, for example if you read somebody’s book:

24:39.520 --> 24:44.280
immediately you are identified with the hero and never with the villain.

24:46.500 --> 24:50.080
We don’t know [that] the villain is much more there than hero, inside us.

24:51.200 --> 24:56.780
It’s a common theme I have seen with human beings. You see, I have now learnt through many lives

24:56.780 --> 24:58.780
and this one what a human being is.

24:59.760 --> 25:03.220
Just the opposite a thing is an incarnation.

25:03.220 --> 25:05.000
Just the opposite is an incarnation.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.620
You see, supposing you have a problem within yourselves,

25:11.120 --> 25:15.060
immediately I try to see within myself if it has problems or not.

25:16.200 --> 25:18.960
In my own vastness I correct it and you get it

25:19.820 --> 25:21.820
because you are my body.

25:23.920 --> 25:28.020
You are within Me, all Sahaja Yogis are within Me,

25:28.020 --> 25:30.020
which I search and find out

25:32.520 --> 25:37.920
That’s how I do it. And unless and until I do it, I don’t feel all right, you have seen that.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.680
My problems are very different from yours.

25:45.900 --> 25:48.380
So we have pay attention on ourselves.

25:49.380 --> 25:53.520
But attention in a way which is very pure wisdom

25:54.800 --> 25:57.340
— is a deeper attention, is not superficial.

25:58.520 --> 26:01.500
One should learn how to go deep into yourself and see for yourself,

26:02.060 --> 26:04.060
"Are we cruel people?"

26:06.060 --> 26:08.060
Am I cruel?

26:08.060 --> 26:10.480
Which part of mine is cruel?

26:12.220 --> 26:15.960
Which part of mine is harming others?”

26:15.960 --> 26:20.180
Now this boy who came, he wouldn’t take out his socks because he thought there was a smell of it.

26:20.800 --> 26:22.800
Are we fragrant ourselves?

26:24.240 --> 26:27.700
Are we considerate about it that we are equally fragrant?

26:29.200 --> 26:32.860
It’s a silent process, it’s a stillness inside of you, acting.

26:37.780 --> 26:39.780
And this has to be there.

26:41.040 --> 26:44.900
And because, as I said, in the western countries you are crashed people

26:49.340 --> 26:52.620
— you have realised you have crashed — it is much more necessary for you people to work harder,

26:52.620 --> 26:54.700
than the people who are yet to crash down.

26:54.700 --> 26:57.860
They are about to, most of them are coming behind you.

26:59.040 --> 27:06.080
And you have to announce with a horn, “Now don’t crash! We have crashed.” That you have to do,

27:07.560 --> 27:09.560
That’s very important.

27:09.560 --> 27:15.120
Any man who has any consideration, any feeling for others,

27:15.960 --> 27:21.520
if he gets hurt by a stone on his way

27:21.520 --> 27:27.840
he’ll immediately stand there and say, “Oh, there’s a stone here, now go. Be careful, don’t topple.”

27:29.840 --> 27:34.000
When we are hurt by certain foolishness and stupidities,

27:34.000 --> 27:38.540
or you can say even the impurities that we have assembled within ourselves,

27:38.540 --> 27:42.220
you see, our own egoistical pursuits,

27:43.080 --> 27:46.200
let us announce to the world that: “We have been foolish,

27:46.580 --> 27:51.880
we have done it, we are broken people, we have broken our hands, we have broken our heads, we have broken our chakras.

27:51.880 --> 27:56.220
Now you don’t, for heaven’s sake you don’t!” Because they are following you.

27:59.740 --> 28:04.520
They think you are going on an ascent. They don’t know you have had enough of it.

28:05.620 --> 28:12.660
In every way possible you have to announce. But the announcement is expected by people.

28:12.660 --> 28:14.380
You see, it's such a funny world

28:15.120 --> 28:17.120
to be a perfect person.

28:20.460 --> 28:22.680
So they want also your ascent.

28:25.080 --> 28:27.080
This is what the world is.

28:27.080 --> 28:32.720
Today, supposing you say: "I was crashed down, I was finished, I have nothing in me to offer you."

28:32.720 --> 28:34.720
They’ll say: "Then what are you talking about, shut up!"

28:37.700 --> 28:40.620
But still, then, you have something to offer, in life.

28:42.800 --> 28:47.640
And what do you have offer is that, “We are crashed because of this.”

28:48.300 --> 28:50.540
It will help so many people, you don’t know!

28:53.160 --> 28:59.920
But people will deny you if you say only that. But if you say, “No I was crashed but I am complete now.”

29:02.220 --> 29:05.960
But your being should announce that you are resurrected.

29:05.960 --> 29:10.500
On the contrary if you are greedy, if you are still the same style that you were,

29:12.240 --> 29:14.180
then who is going to believe this?

29:17.640 --> 29:21.780
So the Sahaj Yoga has given you that path by which you ascend.

29:23.780 --> 29:28.900
And when you ascend you can go on along telling people, “Don’t fall! Don’t fall!

29:31.720 --> 29:35.640
If you fall it’s difficult to ascend as it has happened to us,

29:36.620 --> 29:40.540
so don’t fall! There is a short circuit. Come to the short circuit.”

29:43.080 --> 29:46.880
Your dharmas must be established,  very necessary. "

29:47.820 --> 29:57.360
In the whole of these crashed societies, dharmas are to be established.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.360
What are we doing about it?

30:05.600 --> 30:14.500
In developing countries they gather up their impurities by a wrong premise that they have.

30:16.200 --> 30:22.300
They think: "Oh we must develop. We must have cars, we must have telephones."

30:23.460 --> 30:30.160
You see, the wole attention is: "How effective you are as far as your material things are concerned."

30:30.780 --> 30:38.020
Which is, when they start getting rid of their poverty, they just forget why did they remove their poverty, for what?

30:41.300 --> 30:47.620
It would be like a bridegroom who has to be ready to be married,

30:49.220 --> 30:52.540
then they dress him up, he’s ready to marry.

30:53.620 --> 30:55.620
Now he is ready to be married.

30:56.120 --> 30:57.300
He's married.

30:58.180 --> 31:01.740
Now the night has passed, he has to meet his wife

31:02.580 --> 31:06.820
[but] still he is carrying on with his dress like a fool.

31:07.520 --> 31:10.680
Why did he marry? To love his wife.

31:12.120 --> 31:17.760
Like a fool he still is in his attire, proud of his outer things that he had done to him

31:17.760 --> 31:19.760
without understanding it has a meaning.

31:20.580 --> 31:22.580
We remove poverty for what?

31:22.580 --> 31:24.700
We remove all these problems for what?

31:24.700 --> 31:26.700
We develop for what?

31:26.700 --> 31:31.740
We develop so that our day to day life becomes easier and we have time for God,

31:32.600 --> 31:34.600
we have time for meditation.
