1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000


2
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:28,558
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

3
00:38:32,032 --> 00:38:38,324
As I told you yesterday, that when we are seeking truth,

4
00:38:39,194 --> 00:38:47,076
whatever we find through our central nervous system is the truth.

5
00:38:47,277 --> 00:38:57,320
The rest of it is either your mental projection, or your emotional projection, or your physical projection.

6
00:38:57,521 --> 00:39:01,478
It has no connection with reality.

7
00:39:01,779 --> 00:39:08,735
For example, a person says that one can cure cancer,

8
00:39:08,735 --> 00:39:14,197
with such and such medicine. Now if that medicine is found out,

9
00:39:14,197 --> 00:39:27,992
is being practiced, and is being established as the real cure for cancer, then one can accept such a statement of a person that it is the true statement.

10
00:39:28,293 --> 00:39:37,222
Otherwise, it is still in the process of being a hypothesis, it is not the truth.

11
00:39:37,423 --> 00:39:43,899
But there are so many other mental projections that we have, which is really sometimes very surprising,

12
00:39:43,899 --> 00:39:53,112
and people feel aghast with the kind of projections we use to stop the progress of human beings as a whole.

13
00:39:53,279 --> 00:39:57,714
First of all, we do not think human beings as a whole.

14
00:39:57,915 --> 00:40:05,253
We think that human beings are all divided into various parts. God never created this universe with that idea.

15
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:09,537
It was one world that he created.

16
00:40:09,704 --> 00:40:15,169
Only thing, to create some variety, he had different types of faces, features

17
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:20,332
that he did, just because without the variety you cannot have beauty.

18
00:40:20,533 --> 00:40:30,959
So, as a whole if you have to see the humanity, we have to understand many mistakes we have committed, otherwise, there is no end to our destruction.

19
00:40:31,193 --> 00:40:37,492
Today, we are standing at the brink of a great disaster, it is a great shock we are awaiting

20
00:40:37,693 --> 00:40:46,585
with whatever we have done so far in science, in mental processes, in building up our political, economic big enterprises.

21
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:54,077
All those are standing at a point where we are lost and we do not understand how are we going to go further with it.

22
00:40:54,077 --> 00:41:04,689
The reason is the mind, which is more the Western mind, I should say, not the Eastern mind. But the Western mind goes ahead thinking

23
00:41:05,124 --> 00:41:10,870
of the future which does not exist. And when it enters into the area which does not exist,

24
00:41:11,037 --> 00:41:20,465
it creates so many problems of a very localized type, which has no relationship with the whole.

25
00:41:20,465 --> 00:41:24,880
For example, our whole science is based on analysis.

26
00:41:25,047 --> 00:41:27,069
When you start analyzing things,

27
00:41:27,236 --> 00:41:33,081
you go on analyzing it to such a limit that there is a doctor for one hand and doctor for another hand, such a sort of thing happens.

28
00:41:33,081 --> 00:41:41,531
Apart from that, when you go on analyzing things like that, you do not know what you are doing, is it detrimental to the whole or not?

29
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:50,645
You go on developing say, atomic energy, you go up to a point and find out that atomic energy is destructive.

30
00:41:50,913 --> 00:41:57,107
You develop some medicine like penicillin or Sulphur or something like that, you reach a point where you say, "It is too much".

31
00:41:57,375 --> 00:42:05,378
It all goes to the extremes and you feel the impact of that. Like even in cancer, I have seen, people go for chemotherapy. Horrible stuff!

32
00:42:05,378 --> 00:42:13,130
You lose your hair, everything happens in such a way that part by part, you start losing your body and you exist as a cabbage.

33
00:42:13,331 --> 00:42:17,968
This is no cure, and this is in no way, connected with the whole.

34
00:42:18,728 --> 00:42:26,830
Sahaja Yoga deals with human beings as if they are the whole being and the whole Universe, as a whole.

35
00:42:27,031 --> 00:42:31,879
And the human being is a part and parcel of the whole.

36
00:42:31,879 --> 00:42:37,448
It does not deal with a human being as something separate. Like Indians have different problems,

37
00:42:37,448 --> 00:42:41,790
Russians have different problems, English has different problems.

38
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:46,173
It deals with them as a whole, as one community.

39
00:42:46,374 --> 00:42:55,134
If you do too much in one country, you might affect the other country. Like, I think it was Roosevelt, if I am not incorrect,

40
00:42:55,134 --> 00:43:05,081
he said that, “Prosperity anywhere can be the threat to the prosperity everywhere.”

41
00:43:05,341 --> 00:43:10,533
Is a fact. If one country tries to develop too much on a material level,

42
00:43:10,734 --> 00:43:17,605
then there is a threat to other countries which are depending on it or which are going lower than it.

43
00:43:17,605 --> 00:43:22,823
Because we do not think as a whole that, "How it is going to affect?"

44
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:28,728
Our whole system of the body also goes on like that.

45
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:36,825
Now, in the beginning, I am going to tell you, how medically we suffer with this kind of a treatment that we have.

46
00:43:36,825 --> 00:43:44,966
I have not to, in any way, cast anyone, anything wrong about the doctors.

47
00:43:44,966 --> 00:43:49,063
I have also done medicine myself, and I know what one has to do about it.

48
00:43:49,331 --> 00:43:53,125
But there should be an open-mindedness of a doctor

49
00:43:53,125 --> 00:43:59,957
that he should see that there could be a better way of understanding this medicine from a point of view

50
00:44:00,124 --> 00:44:05,029
If you can become a superior personality, what Confucius has said.

51
00:44:05,263 --> 00:44:13,216
To achieve that superior personality, one need not have to go to medical college or to do his other higher studies.

52
00:44:13,216 --> 00:44:16,371
But just, it is something he has to find within himself.

53
00:44:16,371 --> 00:44:21,630
It is a very simple thing to understand this, that if the tree grows too big

54
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:27,149
- whole Western culture is like that, it has grown too big - it must find out its roots.

55
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:36,097
In the same way, if the human body has grown too much outside, it must find out its roots and also the source of its vital energies.

56
00:44:36,097 --> 00:44:42,051
If it cannot find it, it is definite, somehow or other, it will be exploded and finished.

57
00:44:42,285 --> 00:44:45,913
Now we think that Western countries are very much advanced.

58
00:44:45,913 --> 00:44:54,547
I think they are really on the verge of destruction. The reason is, they have gone so far with every kind of nonsense.

59
00:44:54,781 --> 00:44:58,345
Like immorality. To them, morality is just nonsense.

60
00:44:58,579 --> 00:45:06,794
Like Mr. Freud who was just a half-baked personality, I think, suffered from cancer, he had all kinds of complications, mentally he was absurd,

61
00:45:06,794 --> 00:45:09,625
such a person was accepted as a guru for them.

62
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:17,075
They even discarded Christ because Christ said that, “Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.”

63
00:45:17,075 --> 00:45:21,459
Now how many Christians you will find out like that? Impossible to find one Christian

64
00:45:21,459 --> 00:45:28,728
who doesn’t have – who is not an Indian of course, Indian have very beautiful eyes. They do not have any of all these adulterous ideas.

65
00:45:28,895 --> 00:45:35,035
They are very innocent. But otherwise, you cannot find in the West, one man who has got innocent eyes.

66
00:45:35,437 --> 00:45:39,727
The reason why Christ said this, was not that he was not a medical man.

67
00:45:39,727 --> 00:45:46,379
He knew medicine better than so many of the doctors we have. He used to also cure people just by touching them.

68
00:45:46,647 --> 00:45:52,141
So why, when you have adulterous eyes, when you put your eyes outside with adultery, what do you develop?

69
00:45:52,308 --> 00:45:57,753
You develop a very serious disease with it, which we call as the problems of the Mooladhara.

70
00:45:57,954 --> 00:46:03,509
Problems of the Mooladhara give you so many diseases which we cannot cure otherwise,

71
00:46:03,509 --> 00:46:09,409
which we call them as incurable. I do not want to name them because it will have an effect on people who have these diseases.

72
00:46:09,844 --> 00:46:14,203
Now this Mooladhara is the one, the first centre within ourselves.

73
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:18,591
This is a very important centre within ourselves, it is the first centre

74
00:46:18,591 --> 00:46:23,139
- we have no map here, does not matter, but you have a book.

75
00:46:23,474 --> 00:46:28,646
It is the – what we call the- below the triangular bone, is this centre.

76
00:46:28,646 --> 00:46:33,504
It is below, it is below the triangular bone. Now this one, uou must understand.

77
00:46:33,504 --> 00:46:37,960
Because the triangular bone is the house of the Kundalini,

78
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,212
is the Mooladhara itself.

79
00:46:40,212 --> 00:46:44,430
But the centre of Mooladhara is below the triangular bone.

80
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:50,144
Because it is the centre of our innocence.

81
00:46:50,512 --> 00:46:55,051
This centre of our innocence is the one that gives us wisdom.

82
00:46:55,319 --> 00:46:58,589
That gives us most of our powers, till the end.

83
00:46:58,589 --> 00:47:04,491
We have to have innocence, otherwise, we cannot get Realization.

84
00:47:05,662 --> 00:47:12,633
Under these circumstances, we have to understand that when these saints told us or people like Christ and Buddha

85
00:47:12,633 --> 00:47:21,271
told us that we should have innocent eyes, they meant something deeper. And instead of criticizing them, we should try to see why they said it.

86
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:30,415
Now these centres that are within us are basically seven, there are thousand and one, but basically, there are seven centres.

87
00:47:30,616 --> 00:47:34,057
The first centre is the Mooladhara, is of innocence.

88
00:47:34,258 --> 00:47:39,457
Even a disease like cancer can be easily cured among Indians.

89
00:47:39,658 --> 00:47:45,051
Diseases like a heart can be easily cured among Indians, but very much less with the Western mind.

90
00:47:45,285 --> 00:47:49,533
Because the Western mind is itself is ego personified.

91
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:55,162
It is so egoistical, the doctors, the patients, everybody is so egoistical,

92
00:47:55,162 --> 00:48:01,180
that sometimes you really get frightened of them that it is better to talk to a dog than to talk to them.

93
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:11,020
The ego is so great in the Western countries that it is impossible to tell them that this ego is keeping you out of reality.

94
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:18,273
Now it is a very, very small map and you cannot see it. But it's all right, doesn't matter. What you have to see -

95
00:48:18,474 --> 00:48:25,223
The main thing one has to see is that we have got seven subtle centres within us.

96
00:48:25,524 --> 00:48:30,915
Now the sense of morality that we lack, to begin with, thanks to the Britishers.

97
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:35,918
When they were here, we never became like them. But when they have gone, now we become "svatantra" [independent].

98
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:42,346
Actually "sva-tantra" means the technique of the "sva" [self] means your Spirit.

99
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:49,462
Instead of becoming that, now we have become the "tantra" of the spirit, means the alcohol that you get in a pub.

100
00:48:49,931 --> 00:48:55,789
Now this is all the kindness of the Britishers who lived here for so many years that they have given us the boon

101
00:48:55,956 --> 00:49:01,562
that we have accepted all that they were doing, absolutely a hundred per cent!

102
00:49:01,562 --> 00:49:06,245
And now, they are at the brink of destruction and we are going to follow them.

103
00:49:06,479 --> 00:49:09,969
Those people who have no sense of morality

104
00:49:10,237 --> 00:49:15,431
are more prone to diseases than the people who have a sense of morality.

105
00:49:15,632 --> 00:49:18,932
I met a doctor in England and he said, "I was amazed

106
00:49:18,932 --> 00:49:25,697
that Indians are living with all these mosquitos and parasites and this and they exist! Here, we cannot exist!

107
00:49:25,965 --> 00:49:32,521
We cannot exist even for ten days. I have got disciples who come here and they get sick whether they come here.

108
00:49:32,521 --> 00:49:38,577
Because they cannot bear all the so-called discomfort they have to go through. They get mosquito bites; they get

109
00:49:38,728 --> 00:49:45,188
all kinds of things and they feel horrible. They think this is a sort of an aggression of some parasites on India.

110
00:49:45,389 --> 00:49:48,499
But we see our Indians are quite healthy people".

111
00:49:48,728 --> 00:49:53,103
The reason is they are moral. If they were not moral, they would have been finished in no time.

112
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:56,354
But they are moral people; their morality is keeping them.

113
00:49:56,354 --> 00:50:02,900
Despite all that we have done to them, the way they are deprived, they haven’t got food, they are starving, whatever it is.

114
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:07,728
The morality is their power, with what they are existing today.

115
00:50:07,728 --> 00:50:11,002
And because of that only, you can give them Realization very easily.

116
00:50:11,002 --> 00:50:14,176
Like yesterday, you saw you all got Realization so easily.

117
00:50:14,176 --> 00:50:16,785
Can you imagine such a thing in England or anywhere

118
00:50:16,785 --> 00:50:19,787
where  I go? I go to about fourteen countries, Oh God!

119
00:50:19,787 --> 00:50:28,696
I have to work for days together. Break my hands and legs and everything, it pains me so much to raise their Kundalini because they have no sense of morality.

120
00:50:28,897 --> 00:50:32,510
Here there must be some people who are like them, no doubt.

121
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:40,181
But the crowd is such, the whole public is such which beliefs in the moral sense, in the morality of this country.

122
00:50:40,348 --> 00:50:45,403
And that is how it is easy to give them Realization. So, I bow to these people

123
00:50:45,637 --> 00:50:53,180
who are coming from villages, from smaller places, who are supposed to be not so sophisticated,

124
00:50:53,414 --> 00:50:58,172
not so rich, nothing. But they have one great power within them: it’s their morality.

125
00:50:58,172 --> 00:51:03,235
And in these modern times, if anybody wants to talk about morality, he is an outdated person.

126
00:51:03,469 --> 00:51:07,058
First time I went to America, it was in 73

127
00:51:07,292 --> 00:51:16,168
and they had started all these perversions which I do not want to name in these holy areas.

128
00:51:16,168 --> 00:51:17,982
I do not want to talk about these things.

129
00:51:18,216 --> 00:51:23,747
But when I went and told them, "Don’t do these things! These will cause you trouble. It will give you diseases".

130
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:28,748
They all shunned me, they said, "No, we don’t want ". They preferred such gurus who said, "Go ahead with it.

131
00:51:28,748 --> 00:51:33,390
Do more. Does not matter. You practice it. It is very good. That will help you a lot".

132
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:38,402
All such people became very popular there. While I told them, "This will trouble you".

133
00:51:38,402 --> 00:51:44,082
And when I went now, last year, they used to telephone to Me, "Mother we are already in it:

134
00:51:44,082 --> 00:51:49,655
we have got AIDS, we have got horrible diseases which are incurable, we are dying, now what to do?"

135
00:51:49,655 --> 00:51:52,700
And such a mass of people!

136
00:51:52,934 --> 00:52:00,164
Sixty-five per cent of young people in America are not males, women, they are all frigid people.

137
00:52:00,465 --> 00:52:05,482
They are- if you go and see there, everybody has to go to a psychologist, psychiatrist,

138
00:52:05,482 --> 00:52:08,941
because they are all mentally off, I think. Something's wrong with them.

139
00:52:08,941 --> 00:52:14,152
Are we all going to become like that? Or we are going to come back to our moral sense in India?

140
00:52:14,353 --> 00:52:21,488
Now, because of these moral ideas and because of our high ideas,

141
00:52:21,488 --> 00:52:26,750
perhaps there are hypocrites also, no doubt. We have hypocrites. But does not matter, hypocrites are hypocrites.

142
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:36,549
Let us now devote ourselves to one idea that, "I will become so powerful that nothing can tempt me to become immoral". That is very important.

143
00:52:36,549 --> 00:52:39,630
That is what is Shri Ganesha.

144
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:45,032
This Shri Ganesha that we have, this Maharashtra is a great country where we have got “Ashtavinayakas” [8 Ganesha’s swayambhus].

145
00:52:45,266 --> 00:52:48,312
Ashtavinayakas are some things which have come out of the Mother Earth.

146
00:52:48,479 --> 00:52:57,134
As it is said in the Bible, that whatever is produced by Mother Earth and by the sky

147
00:52:57,134 --> 00:53:03,533
should not be reproduced and worshipped. Because people started reproducing, reproducing, selling those “murtis” [idols] and all that.

148
00:53:03,533 --> 00:53:06,356
But it has talked about the “swayambhu”.

149
00:53:06,523 --> 00:53:15,864
And these swayambhus are in this Maharashtra where it has saved Maharashtrians from getting into lives which are not moral.

150
00:53:16,031 --> 00:53:22,849
But I hear, I am surprised, I hear that the elite class is very anxious to become Westernized, you see.

151
00:53:23,016 --> 00:53:28,166
And let them be Westernized, I do not mind. But they should now go to Houston and stay there.

152
00:53:28,166 --> 00:53:31,807
They have got better hospitals than they have here.

153
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:40,735
This is what you are in for. And as a Mother, I'm sorry I have to tell you very frankly, there is nothing to be learnt from these wretched people.

154
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:45,179
This is the word I have to use; I am sorry to say. Because I have seen them

155
00:53:45,179 --> 00:53:48,536
in and out and I am shocked the way they are.

156
00:53:48,728 --> 00:53:52,940
There is no purity about the mother.

157
00:53:53,107 --> 00:53:56,578
This Freud had no purity of the mother and that is what he has taught it.

158
00:53:56,578 --> 00:54:02,586
The second centre, we can say, the centre important point is your own mother the Kundalini

159
00:54:02,586 --> 00:54:05,539
which is a pure thing. It’s purity,

160
00:54:05,539 --> 00:54:07,689
It’s the Shuddha Iccha [pure desire].

161
00:54:07,856 --> 00:54:16,607
Now how can you talk to these people? I have no words to say, they have no pure ideas, ideas of purity, no relationship of purity.

162
00:54:16,607 --> 00:54:23,028
Every woman to them, every man to them is nothing but a horrible sex point.

163
00:54:23,028 --> 00:54:29,156
I should not say all these things but because I know there are people who are taking to Western culture so fast,

164
00:54:29,156 --> 00:54:32,895
because it is Western. I'd better warn you, be careful on that.

165
00:54:32,895 --> 00:54:38,060
Your children will become hippies, they will take to drugs, they will get into all kinds of dirty habits

166
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:43,421
and filth, and they will come back with horrible diseases which are incurable.

167
00:54:43,588 --> 00:54:52,616
All such people who believe in the Western culture should go and settle down there and enjoy themselves. It is better to leave this country alone.

168
00:54:52,783 --> 00:55:01,017
This is what we have to understand that all those people who believed that, “What’s wrong?

169
00:55:01,017 --> 00:55:04,782
What is wrong?" The wrong is not only physical,

170
00:55:04,782 --> 00:55:08,659
It is mental, emotional and worst of all, it is spiritual.

171
00:55:09,027 --> 00:55:12,095
In every way, it is wrong to be immoral.

172
00:55:12,296 --> 00:55:16,161
And that is what is "dharma", it's the ten valences within us.

173
00:55:16,161 --> 00:55:21,209
These ten valances are nothing but dharma which was preached by all the great saints.

174
00:55:21,209 --> 00:55:27,858
We can start it from Adinatha. We can say Lao Tse. We can say, Confucius, we can say Zoroaster.

175
00:55:27,858 --> 00:55:33,330
We can say Mohammad Sahib, we can Nanak Sahib, we can say Janaka.

176
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:40,237
We can say all of them are the representation or manifestation of Dattatraya

177
00:55:40,237 --> 00:55:43,700
which we know very well in Maharashtra what is Dattatraya.

178
00:55:44,001 --> 00:55:49,794
But despite all that, we do not know: we'll worship Dattatraya and we will not follow him.

179
00:55:49,794 --> 00:55:58,565
This is the only problem we have, that we have all the ideals. We have all the capacity to understand that this is something great.

180
00:55:58,565 --> 00:56:03,630
But we have no power to follow it. Because we are not "samartha" [capable].

181
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:07,592
We are not equal to the meaning of a human being.

182
00:56:07,592 --> 00:56:15,110
If we are powerful then it is easy, it is much easier to be virtuous and righteous than to be something else.

183
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:22,604
But it is not so because people find it is easier to become nasty and violent

184
00:56:22,604 --> 00:56:27,396
than to be good and righteous and kind. It is very difficult for them

185
00:56:27,396 --> 00:56:30,868
which is a natural thing for all of us to be.

186
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:38,093
So this what is the second place, we now come to the triangular bone of the Kundalini where she resides.

187
00:56:38,093 --> 00:56:44,426
She resides in three and a half coils. Now, this is the residual energy, I told you about it.

188
00:56:44,426 --> 00:56:50,053
Within us, as there are, as I told you, there are three powers, three subtle powers which work out.

189
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:57,517
The other day, another college friend of mine told me that they have discovered that, before the thought comes in,

190
00:56:57,517 --> 00:57:03,404
there is no- the activity doesn't show in the brain.

191
00:57:03,404 --> 00:57:08,903
So, the pre-thought activity does not show in the brain. That means it is coming from some subtler force.

192
00:57:08,903 --> 00:57:12,990
I said it is in the medulla oblongata and the brain, it works out.

193
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:18,459
Now we have got three channels. One is on the right-hand side as we said it.

194
00:57:18,459 --> 00:57:22,733
And another on the left-hand side which crosses over at the Agnya.

195
00:57:22,733 --> 00:57:27,677
And they fall down and there is the central path of evolution within us.

196
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:36,266
Now the subtler side of these three “nadis” is the first one was, I told you, on the left hand is, we call it as Mahakali Power.

197
00:57:36,266 --> 00:57:45,615
Now for people who have never even heard the name of Mahakali, it is shocking. What is Mother talking about? Yes, it is the Mahakali Power.

198
00:57:46,096 --> 00:57:50,794
And this Mahakali Power gives you the left sympathetic nervous system.

199
00:57:50,794 --> 00:57:54,400
The right one is the Mahasaraswati Power.

200
00:57:54,634 --> 00:58:00,684
This one gives you the right sympathetic nervous system.

201
00:58:00,684 --> 00:58:08,728
The central one is the Sushumna. This is the path of our evolution.

202
00:58:08,728 --> 00:58:12,762
Throughout we have evolved through this path of Sushumna,

203
00:58:12,762 --> 00:58:17,584
where you ascend up to the Sahasrara.

204
00:58:17,584 --> 00:58:21,236
And when you cross that, then you become a Realized soul.

205
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:25,428
This is called as the Mahalaxmi’s power.

206
00:58:25,595 --> 00:58:32,826
Mahakali, Mahalaxmi, Mahasaraswati. And three of them put together in the brain then become the Adi Shakti, the Primordial Mother.

207
00:58:32,826 --> 00:58:40,988
And that also we call it as the Adi Shakti’s seat, that is above your head.

208
00:58:41,189 --> 00:58:45,945
Now you will be surprised, in this Maharashtra, we have got all these three and a half “mhatras” [coils, Marathi],

209
00:58:45,945 --> 00:58:50,382
being expressed through the Mother Earth. Imagine this Maharashtra, how great it is!

210
00:58:50,382 --> 00:58:55,673
It has got Ashtavinayakas and three and a half coils of these things shown here.

211
00:58:55,673 --> 00:59:00,417
Now people do not know where they are. They don’t know, they are not bothered. They are so great and English,

212
00:59:00,417 --> 00:59:06,603
you know, that they know more about fork and things, they know about whiskies, but they don’t know what a great

213
00:59:06,603 --> 00:59:10,636
blessing God has laid for us in this country.

214
00:59:10,837 --> 00:59:15,377
Let us come back. It's not about Hinduism. It has nothing to do with Hinduism or Islam and all that.

215
00:59:15,377 --> 00:59:19,498
I'll also tell you about Islam. All of them have said about it, it is nothing new.

216
00:59:19,498 --> 00:59:26,260
In the Bible it is said, "I will appear before you like tongues of flames". Now, what are tongues of flames? Are nothing but these centres.

217
00:59:26,461 --> 00:59:29,252
It has also talked about the tree of fire,

218
00:59:29,252 --> 00:59:34,264
which is a silent tree of fire. Moses has talked about it, Christ has talked about it.

219
00:59:34,264 --> 00:59:38,594
But the problem with people is that they do not want to see beyond their noses

220
00:59:38,594 --> 00:59:43,205
and want to accept everything that suits them, to build up their own empires.

221
00:59:43,539 --> 00:59:48,237
Same about Islam, same about Sikhism, same about all the religions,

222
00:59:48,237 --> 00:59:52,309
people have done such a mistake. It does not matter. Does not matter.

223
00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:57,393
Whatever is done, is done, can be cured, because this Kundalini is your mother.

224
00:59:57,393 --> 01:00:04,682
She is sitting down there. Very comfortably she’s sitting down there. She’s waiting for a chance to give you your second birth.

225
01:00:04,682 --> 01:00:08,355
Now she is like your individual mother. Everybody has like a tape recorder.

226
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:12,498
It is being taped all your past and everything in that Kundalini.

227
01:00:12,498 --> 01:00:18,596
She is the one who is sitting down there. And when she rises, what she does, she enlightens every chakra.

228
01:00:18,596 --> 01:00:23,844
And in the chakras, we have different deities. And all those deities, she enlightens.

229
01:00:23,844 --> 01:00:32,053
By that enlightenment, the chakras get vitalized and the diseases cured. There's nothing special about it.

230
01:00:32,053 --> 01:00:35,364
Now for angina, he had, or we have so many other diseases.

231
01:00:35,364 --> 01:00:40,477
Let us see now what happens to the doctors, they can understand it better if I tell them about all these things.

232
01:00:40,477 --> 01:00:45,283
Like we can say all these chakras are expressed as plexuses outside,

233
01:00:45,283 --> 01:00:51,055
as gross plexuses outside which you know of. But they are on the physical level.

234
01:00:51,055 --> 01:00:57,859
But these chakras are dealing with your mental, emotional, spiritual and also physical side.

235
01:00:58,026 --> 01:01:03,106
Now in the medulla oblongata, most of them are placed, except the Agnya Chakra, we can say,

236
01:01:03,106 --> 01:01:06,144
and the seventh chakra which have got the seat there.

237
01:01:06,144 --> 01:01:09,987
So, the whole integration takes place in the limbic area.

238
01:01:09,987 --> 01:01:14,044
Now, this is, they say, is the chakra,

239
01:01:14,044 --> 01:01:16,439
and these are the left and right sides.

240
01:01:16,573 --> 01:01:20,656
Now when we start moving it too much, then what happens

241
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:28,016
that when we start using our sympathetic nervous too much – too much of activity or lethargy, one of the two,

242
01:01:28,016 --> 01:01:30,292
then what happens? It gets broken up.

243
01:01:30,493 --> 01:01:35,344
The relationship with the whole is broken up and you become on your own now.

244
01:01:35,344 --> 01:01:39,295
When one of the cells becomes on its own, that is how it becomes malignant.

245
01:01:39,295 --> 01:01:45,065
When it becomes malignant, you see, an ego-oriented person, if you meet someone, you become ego-oriented.

246
01:01:45,065 --> 01:01:51,251
A person I’ve known, who has been very humble, good, moral, he goes to England he becomes- he talks like a horse.

247
01:01:51,251 --> 01:01:56,400
You just cannot understand what happens to him. Because you meet other horses, you just become like a horse yourself.

248
01:01:56,634 --> 01:02:04,236
You behave like a horse. All the time, you go on behaving in such a manner, that there is nothing of humanity left in you.

249
01:02:04,236 --> 01:02:07,945
So, this is what happens that the cell itself becomes malignant

250
01:02:07,945 --> 01:02:11,759
and such cells are eating other cells and cancer is set up.

251
01:02:11,759 --> 01:02:17,578
Now one simple thing we do, it is a tattva, it is the principle on which we work, is this: raise your Kundalini.

252
01:02:17,578 --> 01:02:25,424
Once you raise the Kundalini, what happens, that the centre gets vitalized, comes back to normal.

253
01:02:25,424 --> 01:02:29,810
Once it gets to the normal, it gets connected to the whole. You get your cancer all right.

254
01:02:30,011 --> 01:02:36,602
It should be all right. Not necessarily in everyone.
But in most of the people, it can work out.

255
01:02:36,602 --> 01:02:39,814
But as soon as I talk about healing – that is why I did not want to talk here.

256
01:02:39,814 --> 01:02:45,761
Immediately everybody will try to find out, how many relations they have got who are sick.

257
01:02:45,761 --> 01:02:48,770
And bring all of them on my head to be cured.

258
01:02:48,770 --> 01:02:52,702
This is not the point. The point is, you have to become the doctors yourself.

259
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:57,576
As Mr Mehrotra has told you very kindly that you have to become a Realized soul

260
01:02:57,576 --> 01:03:02,236
and you can cure them. "Mother does not have so much time, so let us do it that way".

261
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:10,464
You all can become doctors, even a little child knows it. Because what happens that when you become a Realized soul, then your fingers,

262
01:03:10,464 --> 01:03:15,250
your fingertips can feel the centres of another person and of your own.

263
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:17,520
They know what's the problem with another person is.

264
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:22,251
You need not tell that person that, "You have got cancer". But you know.

265
01:03:22,251 --> 01:03:26,902
You know if somebody is going to die, what happens. These things are to be decoded.

266
01:03:26,902 --> 01:03:29,884
That's what only I have done, is to decode it.

267
01:03:29,884 --> 01:03:32,466
Because I had to decode, that is my job.

268
01:03:32,633 --> 01:03:36,185
But after decoding, you must practice it and see for yourself

269
01:03:36,185 --> 01:03:44,944
that these fingertips, five, six and seven are the seven centres. These five, six, seven are seven centres of the right-hand side.

270
01:03:44,944 --> 01:03:48,796
Now if you put them together, they form seven centres like that.

271
01:03:48,796 --> 01:03:56,069
So, you can find out if the person is suffering on the emotional side, or he is suffering on the physical or mental side, you can find out on your fingertips.

272
01:03:56,069 --> 01:04:02,338
The only thing you have to know is the permutations and combinations. How it is working out what happens.

273
01:04:02,539 --> 01:04:05,772
For example, for angina, now it's a Left Vishuddhi,

274
01:04:05,772 --> 01:04:09,453
as we call, on the left-side. Left Vishuddhi and the heart.

275
01:04:09,453 --> 01:04:12,829
If these two combine, then you get an angina.

276
01:04:12,829 --> 01:04:19,783
Angina is caused by lethargic heart, heart that becomes lethargic, it cannot produce any more pumping.

277
01:04:19,783 --> 01:04:22,937
Because sometimes the arteries are thickened and all those things.

278
01:04:22,937 --> 01:04:31,635
But it is not difficult to cure it, because if you can put your effect on the Kundalini to come up here

279
01:04:31,635 --> 01:04:35,338
and make it rise, it will work out like in his case also,

280
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:42,082
same thing happened that when the Kundalini came up to the Vishuddhi chakra, you see, the heart tried to - it is a combination.

281
01:04:42,082 --> 01:04:48,541
The heart pushed it because heart got the information, it pushed itself out, and the whole thing opened out.

282
01:04:48,541 --> 01:04:52,658
And I knew that he was all right. So, I got into the car and went away but he felt quite nervous,

283
01:04:52,658 --> 01:04:56,037
"How is it she's just gone away?" Because I knew he was cured.

284
01:04:56,037 --> 01:04:59,169
You can know, you can cure. The other day somebody came to me,

285
01:04:59,169 --> 01:05:02,237
and he said he has got angina, he was very serious,

286
01:05:02,237 --> 01:05:05,388
and he had to go to Houston. I said all right. I treated him,

287
01:05:05,388 --> 01:05:10,035
and he was improving. I said, "It'll take some time". But he could not help it, he came to London, again I treated him,

288
01:05:10,035 --> 01:05:13,826
and, “You are all right. Believe me, tou are all right. There is nothing wrong with Me”.

289
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:19,364
So, he went to Houston despite all that. And the Houston people said that, "All your tests are wrong, it is all

290
01:05:19,364 --> 01:05:23,170
hospital’s mistake, this". And he went to the best hospital in Bombay.

291
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:31,542
So, it is nothing special, it is nothing great. I can tell you this much. It is only that you have to use your residual energy to come up

292
01:05:31,542 --> 01:05:36,454
and then connect you to the mains so that your energy is all the time flowing into you.

293
01:05:36,454 --> 01:05:46,182
You feel the energy all the time like when you are going in the car and the car is filled with petrol,

294
01:05:46,182 --> 01:05:50,686
but it goes being used up and you find that petrol is finishing.

295
01:05:50,686 --> 01:05:52,795
Then you get worried and you get a tension about it.

296
01:05:52,795 --> 01:05:57,218
But supposing there's a way and method where you get eternally get petrol running

297
01:05:57,218 --> 01:05:59,499
into your car, you are not bothered.

298
01:05:59,499 --> 01:06:07,310
But this is not the only thing that happens, so many things happen which I will tell you in Marathi language, later on. I hope you don' mind.

299
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:14,624
Because I think we should come to some language compromise.

300
01:06:14,624 --> 01:06:24,089
I must say you are all living in Maharashtra and the Marathi language is one of the most enriched languages as far as Kundalini is concerned.

301
01:06:24,089 --> 01:06:26,558
Thank God I was born in Maharashtra, I say.

302
01:06:26,558 --> 01:06:30,402
Because, not only about Kundalini, but it is a very rich language.

303
01:06:30,402 --> 01:06:34,449
And the plays and everything so full of moral values.

304
01:06:34,449 --> 01:06:37,272
Such a beautiful- of course now we have some horrible people

305
01:06:37,272 --> 01:06:41,366
who are trying to copy the West people and some intellectuals are going down.

306
01:06:41,366 --> 01:06:44,722
And there are some of course, very rigid, old-style people also.

307
01:06:44,722 --> 01:06:53,452
But, in between, if you see, it is a beautiful language and one should try to learn it. All my disciples are trying to learn the Marathi language.

308
01:06:53,452 --> 01:06:59,134
I don’t say it should become a national language or anything. My Hindi itself is a very great language, no doubt.

309
01:06:59,134 --> 01:07:04,285
We should have a national language. But those who are living in Maharashtra should know Marathi language

310
01:07:04,285 --> 01:07:09,728
which is such a literary language. It is such a cultured language that if you know it, I mean,

311
01:07:09,728 --> 01:07:16,678
it is so great and deep, you cannot imagine that the whole thing is so historical.

312
01:07:16,879 --> 01:07:20,626
The Maharashtri was the first language that came out of the first “Prakrit” [vernacular].

313
01:07:20,626 --> 01:07:23,229
First the Sanskrit, then the Prakrit, then the Sanskrit.

314
01:07:23,229 --> 01:07:29,746
And then came the Prakrit, in that second Prakrit, came out the first language was Maharashtri, Magadhi, Paishachi, all these five languages,

315
01:07:29,746 --> 01:07:33,799
out of which, the Maharashtri remained the same, the other languages took other forms.

316
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:42,612
So it is the original language and people have worked very hard on the Kundalini in this part of our country

317
01:07:42,612 --> 01:07:46,658
which is such a rich heritage we have.

318
01:07:46,658 --> 01:07:53,233
Of course, we have some very rigid people who talk too much, who read too much, who are eccentric who -

319
01:07:53,233 --> 01:07:56,585
I know all that has to be a part of it, this you cannot help it.

320
01:07:56,585 --> 01:08:02,617
But that does not mean that people are not understanding here the deeper side of human being.

321
01:08:02,617 --> 01:08:08,296
It is in this country, in this part of the country, people have gone to the roots from the very beginning.

322
01:08:08,296 --> 01:08:17,981
From the Dattatreya’s time, even earlier than that. In this country they have worked it out and they have found out the basis on which we reside.

323
01:08:18,182 --> 01:08:26,589
So, it is a very great thing that we have got people like Markandeya, we had people like Shandilya, we had people,

324
01:08:26,589 --> 01:08:34,440
very great people we had, we can say those who gave Realization to Indras and all those things.

325
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:42,208
So this is what this country is the place where the Nathas, where Macchhindranath, Gorakhnath all these people lived in this country where they worked

326
01:08:42,208 --> 01:08:51,186
for their Sahaja Yoga where they gave Realization to people in a very sacred manner. Because it was so sacred, they kept it a secret also.

327
01:08:51,186 --> 01:08:57,248
And they worked it out. They did not talk about religion. They talked about giving Realization, of "amta-bodha".

328
01:08:57,248 --> 01:09:04,062
And one of them who came out very well from the South is Shankaracharya, who talked about atma-bodha throughout.

329
01:09:04,062 --> 01:09:12,232
But you'll still find people who will bring a book of Shankaracharya and argue with me and discuss with me, but not understand what he has said.

330
01:09:12,232 --> 01:09:20,109
After Realization, you will understand what all these things like Gita or Bible or Quran, all these things mean.

331
01:09:20,109 --> 01:09:25,726
So, I have to tell you, these seven chakras are within us. And you have got a book. You can go through and read it.

332
01:09:25,726 --> 01:09:30,993
But understand that it's a fact. Within us, all this power lies.

333
01:09:30,993 --> 01:09:36,861
So, why not, we take to that power? Which is our own, which makes us so powerful and so compassionate,

334
01:09:36,861 --> 01:09:39,397
so great? Because this is what we have to be.

335
01:09:39,397 --> 01:09:43,946
Our evolution is not over, our human awareness is not at that point.

336
01:09:43,946 --> 01:09:46,848
You will be amazed, in the West, it is much more understood.

337
01:09:46,848 --> 01:09:52,895
In the West, people have much more. The intellectuals in the West are much more my disciples than here.

338
01:09:52,895 --> 01:09:57,716
The reason is the intellectuals have reached the height of intellect and they know the limitations of intellect.

339
01:09:57,716 --> 01:10:05,907
And they also say that intellect has a capacity to cheat itself. So they understand it better than the so-called intellectuals in this country.

340
01:10:05,907 --> 01:10:11,810
Is very surprising. I think it is better that it should come from the West because we like the fashions to come from the West.

341
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:14,424
If it comes from the West, then people will take to it.

342
01:10:14,424 --> 01:10:22,334
Otherwise, here, there are people who are challenging me, "We will give you five thousand rupees if you cure such and such person" and this and that.

343
01:10:22,334 --> 01:10:24,966
This is absolutely, basically wrong.

344
01:10:24,966 --> 01:10:30,786
Because I have nothing to do with money and all that. It is nothing to do. On the contrary, come and see. Get your Realization.

345
01:10:30,786 --> 01:10:35,530
Why are you challenging Me? Am I taking your money? Am I doing anything wrong to you?

346
01:10:35,530 --> 01:10:38,107
Why are you after my life? I have done no wrong to you.

347
01:10:38,107 --> 01:10:42,026
I have not done nor brought anything that is disastrous to you.

348
01:10:42,026 --> 01:10:46,469
I do not want your votes. I am not in politics, or economics or anything.

349
01:10:46,469 --> 01:10:49,921
Why should you be angry with me?”. The reason is they feel challenged.

350
01:10:50,055 --> 01:10:55,223
It is better, all of those who think they are intellectuals must have that true intelligence.

351
01:10:55,390 --> 01:10:58,456
That is what I find in the West. They have true intelligence, a sharp intelligence,

352
01:10:58,456 --> 01:11:04,749
to see the point that it exists, it is there. And then to respect that intelligence and to accept it full-hearted.

353
01:11:04,749 --> 01:11:08,070
That is what is needed today among the intelligent people.

354
01:11:08,070 --> 01:11:12,048
Not to be tied down to whatever knowledge they have acquired, but the knowledge is unlimited.

355
01:11:12,282 --> 01:11:22,122
Even Newton who was such a great scientist said that, "I am like a little child, picking up pebbles on the shore of knowledge."

356
01:11:22,289 --> 01:11:29,147
Newton said that. But that kind of humility is gone now. People do not have that humble nature.

357
01:11:29,147 --> 01:11:34,978
They don't have that normally. Actually, knowledge is more respected. "Vidya, vinaye na shobhate"

358
01:11:34,978 --> 01:11:39,836
If you have respect, then you must have the humbleness to see that there is another point

359
01:11:39,836 --> 01:11:44,490
which you should see and if you have to really help people and yourself and the whole world

360
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:50,299
at large, you must bow down to understanding that there could be a better way

361
01:11:50,299 --> 01:11:53,291
of solving these problems you have not solved at all.

362
01:11:53,291 --> 01:11:55,863
Because I tell you all these projections are linear.

363
01:11:55,863 --> 01:11:59,240
They move in one direction. They fall off. Everything is linear.

364
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:04,214
But Sahaja Yoga is a synthesis of everything. It is like a light in the centre which spreads on all sides.

365
01:12:04,214 --> 01:12:13,848
It does not go to one side and falls off. And again, turns back to you to harm you. It is not that way. It is one point from where the light emits all over.

366
01:12:13,848 --> 01:12:21,115
So, I have to request you to take your science and everything with great understanding.

367
01:12:21,115 --> 01:12:25,973
I had to learn science myself and also medicine just talk to doctors – it's not the point.

368
01:12:25,973 --> 01:12:32,424
Also, if it is a doctor who is a Realized soul, it helps a lot on the medical side.

369
01:12:32,424 --> 01:12:40,135
If it is a psychiatrist who is a Realized soul, it helps tremendously for the mad people to get cured.

370
01:12:40,135 --> 01:12:49,935
So, if you have got that knowledge, it is the epitome of that knowledge. It is the main principle, the tattva of that knowledge, which you catch.

371
01:12:49,935 --> 01:12:53,886
And once you have the principle, it is very easy to handle the whole situation.

372
01:12:54,053 --> 01:13:00,677
As my professors will tell you, I used to always top the list in my college and schools. And I never used to study much.

373
01:13:00,677 --> 01:13:06,120
And because to me, it came out very simple. Because the whole, I knew the principle behind everything.

374
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:10,288
So, to weave them together was very easy for me because it is the foundation I knew.

375
01:13:10,288 --> 01:13:20,667
In the same way, it should be easier for people who get into Sahaja Yoga, get their Realization, forgetting their education for the time being.

376
01:13:20,667 --> 01:13:28,061
And then coming back to their education to use it for a better purpose, purpose of treating the whole.

377
01:13:28,061 --> 01:13:29,705
May God bless you all.

378
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:38,274
I hope I have been able to give you some introduction to Sahaja Yoga. But of course, it is not possible to elaborately talk about Sahaja Yoga.

379
01:13:38,274 --> 01:13:41,121
I must have given at least two thousand lectures only in England.

380
01:13:41,121 --> 01:13:48,512
So, you will be surprised. But they have got my tapes. And if you get your Realization, and if you are established, you can listen to those tapes.

381
01:13:48,512 --> 01:13:58,240
Because we have certain ways of avoiding coming in contact with people who are just beginners.
Let the beginners settle down.

382
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:01,844
Once they have settled down, they have that much power to bear the truth.

383
01:14:01,844 --> 01:14:05,644
Otherwise, if you tell somebody the truth, he can come up and beat you. That's all he'll do.

384
01:14:05,644 --> 01:14:10,866
That is what they did. What was the need to crucify Christ? I cannot understand. Can you explain?

385
01:14:10,866 --> 01:14:13,725
No need at all, what was he doing? He did no wrong.

386
01:14:13,725 --> 01:14:19,984
And because he did no wrong and he was crucified, in the same way, it is tactful to go slowly about people.

387
01:14:19,984 --> 01:14:25,978
So, first of all, you have to settle down in Sahaja Yoga, and then you get the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga.

388
01:14:25,978 --> 01:14:33,893
There are certain books which we do not give to people because we do not think that they can read it and understand it and bear it.

389
01:14:33,893 --> 01:14:36,529
So, after some time, they can bear it.

390
01:14:36,529 --> 01:14:49,831
But I appeal to all the intelligentsia of Pune city, because it is the centre of intelligence in Maharashtra,

391
01:14:50,032 --> 01:14:53,301
to stand up to this and to see for themselves.

392
01:14:53,301 --> 01:15:06,033
I have not done any studies. I have not read any books. I have done nothing of the kind.
I have just read that compassion is the greatest power

393
01:15:06,301 --> 01:15:09,987
and I have just known the methods of compassion and love.

394
01:15:10,221 --> 01:15:21,258
And I have worked it out with that compassion which is not attached to anything. It has no repayment. It has no advancements. It has no asking.

395
01:15:21,258 --> 01:15:25,504
It is just there. It just emits. It just works out. That’s all I know.

396
01:15:25,504 --> 01:15:32,921
I don't know all these big books. When people tell me, Gyaneshwari is like that, Gita is like that and Shankaracharya said that – I hear from others.

397
01:15:32,921 --> 01:15:35,541
But I do not read, I do not have time to read anything.

398
01:15:35,742 --> 01:15:42,003
But I would say that you have to read yourself, through Sahaja Yoga and you can read others also very easily.

399
01:15:42,003 --> 01:15:45,617
And then what these books have said, you will understand better.

400
01:15:45,818 --> 01:15:47,150
May God Bless You Again.

401
01:15:47,150 --> 01:15:51,395
And I hope you will sit down for a while to listen to me in Marathi language.
