Now, we have sixteen centers in Australia
and Australia is a very progressive

00:00:15.274 --> 00:00:20.148
Sahaja yoga thing. We have got schools now
there, they're running schools and the

00:00:21.608 --> 00:00:27.748
teachers are extremely well-behaved and
visionaries and they look after the children

00:00:27.748 --> 00:00:34.380
very well. The government people sent
somebody for observation and they have

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.140
remarked that, "Whatever they proclaim,
that's what they manifest," and they have

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.504
given good certificates to us. And there's
another great thing has happened in Delhi

00:00:44.504 --> 00:00:52.156
University, that the Delhi University has
accepted that a person can do, only a doctor

00:00:52.156 --> 00:00:59.764
can do a PhD or we can say, the doctorate
in Sahaja yoga and he gets the highest

00:01:00.253 --> 00:01:06.473
degree called the Doctor of Medicine. And
a, perhaps maybe, after some time they

00:01:06.473 --> 00:01:12.263
will allow anyone to do that. This is about
the Medicine part of it. In agriculture we

00:01:12.263 --> 00:01:16.875
have done lots of research, for example, we
have somebody here, an expert on agriculture.

00:01:17.086 --> 00:01:24.776
He's also done lot of research and we found
out that with vibrations, we start after realization.

00:01:24.776 --> 00:01:30.826
If you vibrate the water and if you water
the plants with that, then sometimes you

00:01:30.826 --> 00:01:36.212
might get even ten times more breed. 
That's what they did in India, in one of

00:01:36.212 --> 00:01:40.785
the Agricultural University but here also he's
found out that there's tremendous difference

00:01:40.785 --> 00:01:45.765
between the growth of an ordinary thing.
Another thing we have found out in agriculture,

00:01:46.035 --> 00:01:53.295
that if you get vibrations then, even an
ordinary cow can give lot of milk but if

00:01:53.295 --> 00:01:58.028
you have hybrid cows then, you see, it's 
not good for the brain because the person,

00:01:58.028 --> 00:02:03.424
who takes hybrid milk, also gets hybrid
and his brain becomes little wobbly.

00:02:03.424 --> 00:02:11.654
So better, to have a pure milk from a cow which
is not being put to this kind of a experimentation.

00:02:11.654 --> 00:02:16.166
Moreover, food also, if it's hybrid food,
is also not very good for us because that

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:21.335
spoils our nerves, I think. But ordinary
seeds you cannot use because they have

00:02:21.335 --> 00:02:28.354
weakened and they cannot reproduce. So,
when we vibrate them, they produce very well,

00:02:28.354 --> 00:02:34.324
just like, better than even sometimes,
hybrid thing and the food tastes very well

00:02:34.324 --> 00:02:39.806
and it doesn't give those complications.
So this can help in agriculture in India and

00:02:39.831 --> 00:02:44.721
government has allotted us lot of land, 
where we going to now experiment and we

00:02:44.721 --> 00:02:49.313
are going to start the experimentation
there, to show that how we can use this.

00:02:49.415 --> 00:02:55.425
But many farmers, who are Sahaja yogis have
done a lot of job and they have discovered

00:02:55.425 --> 00:03:04.230
that even animals and this, what you call, farming,
everything is helped very much by vibration.
