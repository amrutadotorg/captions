WEBVTT

00:02.139 --> 00:04.139
[UNCLEAR]

00:14.446 --> 00:21.095
See born with you is the right achieve is yoga

00:23.596 --> 00:25.596
This is yoga is the union

00:26.145 --> 00:28.145
with the all-pervading

00:28.725 --> 00:30.645
Divine love

00:30.645 --> 00:32.446
so first

00:32.446 --> 00:34.366
you have to

00:34.366 --> 00:36.366
Take it as a hypothesis

00:36.916 --> 00:38.916
But keep your mind open

00:39.616 --> 00:41.946
If it exists there is a power

00:43.095 --> 00:48.935
Which has come to us this knowledge has come to us from ancient times [UNCLEAR], and it stays

00:50.626 --> 00:55.806
Right from Markendaya, Adi sankaracharya

00:57.976 --> 01:01.626
Then we had 13th-century Dnyaneshwara

01:03.136 --> 01:06.305
who described [UNCLEAR]

01:09.075 --> 01:11.075
then we had Kabira, Janaka

01:11.356 --> 01:17.375
Namadeva all of them all these saints sung the Sahaj Samadhi

01:25.056 --> 01:29.396
He needs awareness the Samadhi mean where it is united with all pervading power

01:32.736 --> 01:34.736
This is our heritage

01:35.646 --> 01:41.095
This cannot come from British. They're still primitive as far as

01:43.416 --> 01:45.716
our spiritual life is concerned

01:48.395 --> 01:52.765
It's so primitive that recently there was a big quarrel

01:55.026 --> 01:56.975
Whether the women

01:56.975 --> 01:58.206
should

01:58.206 --> 02:04.645
Become the priest or not. I mean in India women is regarded as Sakthi

02:05.736 --> 02:08.186
So I mean as far as the spirituality is concerned

02:09.005 --> 02:11.005
They do not have much ideas

02:12.276 --> 02:14.276
Now this is our heritage

02:15.005 --> 02:17.575
from ancient times it has been with us

02:19.116 --> 02:21.116
we had three types of

02:22.146 --> 02:24.146
you can say

02:25.686 --> 02:27.805
Search by people

02:29.196 --> 02:36.715
Three institutions you can say or three types of people were searching the truth, perhaps our country is so good that

02:37.986 --> 02:39.986
We can live in a forest

02:40.236 --> 02:44.905
See in India if you have to go out of the house takes half an hour to dress up yourself

02:45.155 --> 02:49.255
we have to always fight with nature. Our country so congenial

02:50.706 --> 02:53.605
The people could live in the forest they don't have to worry about all these outside things

02:54.935 --> 02:58.765
And so this knowledge was you can say

03:00.456 --> 03:06.445
One of three types first one by which they went into research

03:12.595 --> 03:14.595
of all the creation

03:18.205 --> 03:23.145
why these creation is done I mean all the material side of it, so that's how we had

03:24.476 --> 03:28.395
Since now all the idea about all the Antariksha means all the

03:29.666 --> 03:35.925
Heavenly bodies that we call as [UNCLEAR] all these things they knew. the astrology has come from India

03:37.046 --> 03:39.945
So they knew about the stars this is that everything

03:40.705 --> 03:42.705
apart from that

03:43.166 --> 03:45.166
they wanted to

03:49.046 --> 03:51.046
make the matter to work out

03:53.216 --> 03:59.925
And hence he would do those of [UNCLEAR] all that

04:01.345 --> 04:09.165
Because they wanted to utilize the matter as science. Just like science, but this time was different

04:11.425 --> 04:17.564
Now people won't believe you saying we had vimanas and all that, but we have this worse

04:18.986 --> 04:26.685
People won't believe, we are supposed to be most primitive people according to them, but we had all these sciences

04:29.995 --> 04:34.935
gradually built-up by people because they wanted to excite through Mantras

04:36.446 --> 04:38.275
those matters

04:38.275 --> 04:42.645
there are words like Anu, Renu. Renu is the molecule and

04:48.775 --> 04:50.775
Anu means Atom

04:52.286 --> 04:55.576
so we had all these words within us we knew all these things

04:57.506 --> 04:59.595
[UNCLEAR] in a way

05:00.956 --> 05:04.875
This what one side they use Vedas. by using the Vedas it written that

05:06.266 --> 05:08.295
by reading this if you do not

05:08.966 --> 05:10.966
get [Vidita?] Vidita is the word

05:11.666 --> 05:13.496
Vidita means what?

05:13.496 --> 05:20.025
Vidita doesn't mean know through your brain it means you should know on your central nervous system

05:24.806 --> 05:31.485
As you can see me and feel me in the same way you should be able to feel this all-pervading power

05:32.366 --> 05:34.366
that is Vidita

05:37.166 --> 05:38.636
another word

05:38.636 --> 05:40.636
Bodha like Buddha. Bodha

05:41.606 --> 05:47.145
both is the same that you should know it on your central nervous system that is Bodha

05:51.426 --> 05:53.426
so this Vidha and Bodha

05:54.246 --> 05:58.136
These things you should have if you are [UNCLEAR] you should get that

05:58.746 --> 06:00.426
other [UNCLEAR]

06:00.426 --> 06:05.636
So what was the thing is that scientists must be realised souls? They should be evolved souls?

06:08.796 --> 06:10.796
this was the thing

06:11.496 --> 06:17.216
That came another type of worship they call it as left side worship is Bakthi

06:18.576 --> 06:22.615
Because see people were not bother so much of Material things in India

06:24.516 --> 06:26.516
So they were all searching

06:27.726 --> 06:35.576
So they thought there is some higher power it works. We saw the saints and Saints told them that you make Bakthi

06:37.026 --> 06:40.166
Bakthi a lot, by which you will keep your life [UNCLEAR]

06:41.646 --> 06:49.226
These days Bakthi have no meaning because in the mouth to say something and do something else it's different in those days, they use to do Bakthi

06:50.436 --> 06:53.215
By that we used to remember what they're supposed to

06:54.336 --> 06:58.766
What is should be the lifestyle? What is good for you? What is bad for you?

06:59.406 --> 07:01.406
so this Bakthi started

07:02.136 --> 07:04.136
But there was another third

07:08.256 --> 07:12.446
this was called as [Nath?]

07:13.776 --> 07:17.876
first one was right side another was left side, and this is in the center

07:23.826 --> 07:29.635
And you'll be surprised, that in this Maharastra of yours this [UNCLEAR]

07:35.436 --> 07:37.436
And [UNCLEAR]

07:38.526 --> 07:40.526
they believed

07:40.836 --> 07:45.536
In awakening that is residual power called Kundalani

07:51.456 --> 07:53.516
By which they could transform themselves

08:00.575 --> 08:05.905
So this knowledge was mostly in Sanskrit language. 6th century Adi shankaracharya talked about it

08:15.066 --> 08:17.066
But all in Sanskrit

08:17.495 --> 08:19.495
general public did not [know?]

08:19.716 --> 08:25.675
But also, there's a tradition at one guru will have only one disciple only one

08:26.436 --> 08:28.436
Till the [crunch?] it

08:31.295 --> 08:38.064
now this Guru nanaka came much later, but before that Janaka had only one disciple.

08:38.064 --> 08:54.056
His name was Nachiketa[UNCLEAR] then in the first century Gyneswara tremendous personality at the age of 20 what he has written

08:54.216 --> 08:56.216
I mean I tell you people who anything about spirituality really can get lost tremendous

09:02.796 --> 09:04.796
Now this Gyneswara asked permission from his Guru to his brother

09:06.995 --> 09:09.325
You should allow me at-least to write it

09:10.296 --> 09:12.775
Gyneswari at least to write it

09:13.445 --> 09:16.645
Tell them what it is in a way that I am not going to work it out

09:17.315 --> 09:19.315
But let me tell the masses

09:20.046 --> 09:22.705
So he wrote it Gyneswari the sixth chapter

09:24.516 --> 09:26.516
six are there about Kundalini

09:28.745 --> 09:32.365
But because you see [UNCLEAR] those who were in charge of religion?

09:33.305 --> 09:39.835
could not accept it because they do it mean to so they said sixth chapter is [UNCLEAR] means to be abandon

09:40.326 --> 09:42.326
not to be written

09:42.966 --> 09:47.366
The whole thing went into another darkness

09:50.466 --> 09:56.125
Because see in a moment fundamental said they need want something really come out

09:57.096 --> 09:59.096
they didn't know what to do

09:59.226 --> 10:01.226
All right

10:04.276 --> 10:09.695
Then came after 16th century was full of saints

10:11.235 --> 10:13.235
not only Maharastra everywhere

10:14.055 --> 10:16.055
even in Punjab you know that

10:17.565 --> 10:19.565
Guru nanak, Kabira

10:20.055 --> 10:24.815
[UNCLEAR] so many all over at the time of Shivaji there was

10:26.475 --> 10:28.475
she all full of it and

10:29.685 --> 10:32.734
they were talked about Kundalani. They asked

10:37.155 --> 10:39.016
[UNCLEAR]

10:39.016 --> 10:41.825
How much time do you think Kundalini to rise?

10:42.706 --> 10:45.125
So he said tatkSaNam that moment but the

10:45.826 --> 10:48.966
there should be a person who is giver and  person who take it that moment

10:53.445 --> 10:59.945
So in that authority he should not go to that  modern writers about Kundalini these are our authorities

11:01.485 --> 11:04.895
But as it is very few people got realisation

11:08.175 --> 11:10.175
Kabira as throughout written about nothing

11:11.385 --> 11:12.885
he says Surathi Kundalini called Surathi

11:12.885 --> 11:17.224
can you imagine human beings how they are

11:18.285 --> 11:20.285
Surathi is the name of

11:20.385 --> 11:23.194
[Tabba?]

11:24.016 --> 11:27.545
In Bihar where he they called Shruti tabbaa?

11:30.225 --> 11:32.225
She works in

11:33.826 --> 11:39.485
then Kabira not only Kabira [UNCLEAR] he went from Maharastra to Punjab and Guru nanak respected him

11:45.285 --> 11:47.285
and he has written

11:49.065 --> 11:51.065
Such a big book in Punjabi

11:52.035 --> 11:54.035
[UNCLEAR]

11:54.646 --> 12:00.545
many of his poems are in [UNCLEAR] and also of

12:01.275 --> 12:04.205
[UNCLEAR]

12:05.475 --> 12:07.475
[UNCLEAR]

12:07.875 --> 12:13.415
Because Guru nanaka thought best is to collect all the verses from all these

12:14.086 --> 12:16.086
saints and group them together

12:16.306 --> 12:19.595
Not to write anything else, but what they said so keep it pure

12:20.385 --> 12:22.745
And that's how Namadeva

12:24.286 --> 12:29.435
who try really learn Punjabi language, and he wrote all these things in Punjabi

12:30.766 --> 12:37.236
That is how it came, but they all have talked about right Guru Nanak said Sahaja samadhi. so that is how it came

12:37.996 --> 12:39.856
Sahaj samadhi lavo

12:39.856 --> 12:42.515
we can say Sahaj means something spontaneous or easy

12:43.815 --> 12:45.815
I have told you the meaning of the word Sahaj

12:50.445 --> 12:53.405
But everything is even it is in the book

12:54.226 --> 12:56.086
I've seen that

12:56.086 --> 13:00.276
People think by reading book you can get that sense

13:00.976 --> 13:02.976
like this if you have headache

13:05.505 --> 13:11.405
then I write down prescription take Anacin then you go on reading take Anacin take Anacin then headache won't go it will be worse even

13:11.476 --> 13:17.226
It's like this so all these books you see has put limitations in [UNCLEAR]

13:18.676 --> 13:23.735
But I've seen people who go on reading akhand ramayan akhand geeta part they go on reading

13:26.716 --> 13:28.716
they go on akhand

13:30.496 --> 13:33.126
What they have said, they have not seen in it

13:35.236 --> 13:39.695
Nanaka Said [UNCLEAR] why are you going to the jungle

13:41.356 --> 13:44.165
He says it is in with in you why are you going to Jungles?

13:51.346 --> 13:53.825
So all the Saints had to suffer in a way

13:55.426 --> 13:57.426
because nobody understood

13:58.486 --> 14:01.595
See the bond has to be established nobody understood

14:09.385 --> 14:11.385
So this Kundalini awakening

14:12.746 --> 14:18.915
It's a residual power within us as you know we have three autonomous nervous system within us

14:20.366 --> 14:26.265
One is left side Other is right side sympathetic and in the center we have parasympathetic nervous system

14:26.816 --> 14:30.915
And whatever we have achieved in our evolutionary process as human being

14:32.816 --> 14:36.825
Is Expressed by our central nervous system?

14:37.885 --> 14:39.236
Alright

14:39.236 --> 14:44.866
Like see if you want to take this dog to a dirty he can go we have

14:45.866 --> 14:47.866
We have conception of beauty

14:48.326 --> 14:51.556
We can see beauty we can understand colors he does not

14:52.316 --> 14:58.155
So in evolutionary process whatever we have achieved is expressed in our central nervous system

15:08.375 --> 15:13.165
Now it should be treated as hypothesis to begin with to see because you should not take it for granted at all

15:16.896 --> 15:19.435
Now this Kundalini resides in the triangular bone

15:20.676 --> 15:22.676
Which is called as sacrum

15:23.135 --> 15:26.095
That means that the greek knew it's a sacred bone

15:29.676 --> 15:32.395
It's a greek word sacred in greek word

15:33.185 --> 15:34.476
is

15:34.476 --> 15:36.476
at the base of the

15:37.086 --> 15:39.596
spinal chord there is a bone triangular

15:40.956 --> 15:42.956
is lies with that

15:43.505 --> 15:46.434
And about that are six centers

15:49.055 --> 15:51.175
below that is one center

15:57.546 --> 15:59.546
below that is the center

16:00.875 --> 16:03.145
Which we call as Mooladhar

16:04.236 --> 16:07.255
Because Kundalini is the Mool means a root

16:08.406 --> 16:13.616
because is the support of root. Mooladhar

16:15.305 --> 16:18.115
Now in the medical terminology and understand

16:19.086 --> 16:20.406
that

16:20.406 --> 16:23.846
the center of looks after on the physical side

16:24.996 --> 16:27.746
Our pelvic plexus

16:31.326 --> 16:38.846
Which deals or which functions or all of our excretion including sex

16:52.086 --> 16:54.086
now this is

16:55.296 --> 16:59.936
to be understood very clearly that it is like below the Kundalini

17:01.776 --> 17:07.016
So sex does not play any part in rising its a very important point

17:23.445 --> 17:25.246
Okay, people have

17:25.246 --> 17:29.105
perverted the whole thing. I don't know all kinds of things that they have done

17:29.716 --> 17:33.666
and they said that to the sex energy which has to increase

17:34.516 --> 17:37.926
There's nothing like sex energy It's like any other energy

17:39.796 --> 17:42.665
But only thing with that

17:44.986 --> 17:46.986
this Energy is

17:47.686 --> 17:50.436
used for a particular purpose of excretion or

17:51.376 --> 17:52.726
communication

17:52.726 --> 18:00.666
Of your desires or whatever it is, but it had nothing to do either ascending ascent of the Kundalini nothing to do

18:06.736 --> 18:08.736
on the contrary

18:08.986 --> 18:11.016
when the Kundalini awakened

18:11.806 --> 18:14.256
this center absolutely stops

18:14.776 --> 18:16.776
no excretion of any

18:16.816 --> 18:20.346
You will be surprised sometimes I have program for 10 hours

18:21.016 --> 18:23.016
11 hours I won't go to bathroom

18:24.286 --> 18:26.286
It just stops

18:29.116 --> 18:35.916
That's why Christ have said you have to become a children to enter it to the Kingdom because this is the innocence

18:46.706 --> 18:48.825
Now this going little further

18:49.976 --> 18:51.446
is that

18:51.446 --> 18:53.126
on the center

18:53.126 --> 18:54.626
is placed

18:54.626 --> 18:56.626
the deity of Shri Ganesha

19:00.116 --> 19:01.496
it has great meaning

19:01.496 --> 19:05.056
What is Shri Ganesha how this is placed there all that suff we will learn

19:06.236 --> 19:09.196
but I told this scientist in America

19:10.586 --> 19:13.575
that this center is made of carbon atom

19:14.936 --> 19:17.745
Carbon atom has got four leaves?

19:19.256 --> 19:21.146
if you see

19:21.146 --> 19:23.066
this center

19:23.066 --> 19:25.185
has a carbon atom

19:26.186 --> 19:28.755
you make the model out of carbon atom

19:30.116 --> 19:34.906
Then you watch if you see this one, how many are you trained?

19:36.476 --> 19:37.646
the

19:37.646 --> 19:39.236
Scientist is here

19:39.236 --> 19:46.516
So if you see it from right side on the left side what you see of that atom is Swastika

19:47.756 --> 19:49.756
clearly

19:57.986 --> 19:59.986
see

20:02.186 --> 20:04.186
just show them they are journalist

20:06.596 --> 20:11.325
[UNCLEAR]

20:14.366 --> 20:18.616
So you see from left side the right side you see Swastika

20:23.966 --> 20:29.176
Then you should go see them see from the left side to the right side you see Omkara

20:34.226 --> 20:38.386
If you see from down upward then you see alpha and omega

20:44.696 --> 20:46.696
Alpha and Omega

20:47.336 --> 20:52.575
see now this I stated in one of my lectures these people immediately jumped on to it

20:52.576 --> 20:59.146
They took a atom of carbon took the model made it how about the scientists cleaner now?

20:59.146 --> 21:03.615
He's made this out of that beautifully made, but first they made huge myth?

21:09.896 --> 21:12.555
and what Christ has said I am the alpha and omega

21:14.846 --> 21:20.715
In these symbols alpha Omega which we use in our mathematics are ancient

21:22.196 --> 21:24.196
so Christ is

21:24.806 --> 21:26.806
incarnation of

21:28.046 --> 21:30.046
the Ganesha.. it a scientific proof

21:40.306 --> 21:42.306
[UNCLEAR]

21:47.146 --> 21:49.146
[UNCLEAR]

21:56.596 --> 22:02.136
So Ganesha is an eternal child

22:05.776 --> 22:08.225
That's why he has got trunk of elephant

22:16.126 --> 22:18.215
Innocence is our innocence

22:20.596 --> 22:22.596
so when the Kundalini rises

22:24.106 --> 22:26.886
And she's awaken, she can be awaken

22:27.946 --> 22:29.656
somehow I

22:29.656 --> 22:31.426
Must say that

22:31.426 --> 22:33.426
this Modern Sahaja yoga

22:33.916 --> 22:37.355
Only thing if I discovered anything is this that?

22:38.206 --> 22:40.206
amass awakening of the Kundalini amass

22:44.296 --> 22:46.296
thousands can get it

22:46.636 --> 22:48.636
That's all I will serve nothing much

22:49.216 --> 22:54.606
This is very ancient science they used to do to one person two person

22:55.126 --> 22:57.276
now it can be done amass

22:57.976 --> 22:59.976
in Russia

23:00.556 --> 23:05.196
We always have program in a big stadium 16000 minimum people

23:07.396 --> 23:13.595
Practically everybody is released Russians are the best. I don't know what Communism has turned

23:17.326 --> 23:21.065
They are not at all idioit. They're not American style

23:22.816 --> 23:26.736
very straight forward and very introspective

23:27.616 --> 23:32.166
Think he'll be stupid choices that democracy side you'll see

23:32.746 --> 23:36.215
in America even a lock has to be different tiles

23:36.976 --> 23:38.976
has to be different

23:39.076 --> 23:41.076
door of the

23:42.476 --> 23:44.866
car is differently handle is different

23:44.866 --> 23:51.315
I mean if you get into their bathroom everything has to be different the choices are so maddening

23:51.836 --> 23:57.586
And there are all the time busy. What should we do something more to show that wear something different

23:58.106 --> 24:00.856
whole energy wasted these people

24:01.466 --> 24:06.165
He provided for all material things because that make them a little lethargically careless

24:06.806 --> 24:14.745
but on the whole there were not bothered about politics they didn't have to worry who coming to Chief Minister nothing

24:14.745 --> 24:16.586
so

24:16.586 --> 24:18.586
see their attention was

24:18.926 --> 24:20.395
introspective

24:20.395 --> 24:25.665
And the whole thing are always be because if you see Dostoyevsky? or any one of the items

24:26.576 --> 24:28.576
You have read Crime and punishment

24:29.066 --> 24:32.446
You can see how introspective even the hero was

24:34.495 --> 24:36.415
so wonderful knwoledge

24:36.415 --> 24:42.644
These people that they even the hero introspect before falling in love why I'm falling in love

24:42.645 --> 24:49.004
What is the thing but it's wonderful so these people are very introspective and so in Russia it has become extremely

24:49.586 --> 24:53.265
Extremely successful, but all other your gurus and all of them

25:02.236 --> 25:04.236
And they have a sense also, I think

25:05.596 --> 25:07.596
what is truth and what is not

25:08.506 --> 25:10.865
Moreover if anybody who asks for money

25:13.666 --> 25:15.056
They don't like they understand you can't sell spirituality they don't like

25:15.076 --> 25:19.056
how you can't sell spirituality

25:19.786 --> 25:23.585
Not in India even we don't understand this of course American's understand this

25:25.006 --> 25:27.006
The more you charge the better it is

25:29.656 --> 25:34.115
They would say like this is a these gurus are very good they have sale

25:36.016 --> 25:39.095
It's all shopping its marketting

25:40.936 --> 25:43.956
But they understood and we have now

25:45.466 --> 25:47.466
200 doctors in Russia practising Sahaja yoga

25:50.536 --> 25:52.536
and the scientists

25:53.416 --> 25:55.416
300 of them invited

25:56.056 --> 26:02.826
And when I talk about science, they said no more science we had enough we have reached the last end of it

26:02.826 --> 26:05.526
We don't want anything of you you tell us about gods law

26:06.166 --> 26:10.445
Divine laws please don't talk about science

26:13.276 --> 26:17.345
They also he come like this is somebody here, but was working really well

26:24.076 --> 26:26.706
So what happens when the Kundalini awakens?

26:29.836 --> 26:31.836
it passes through

26:33.976 --> 26:40.356
Six centers as I told you the first is establish is innocence. That's the support

26:44.746 --> 26:46.746
Then it rises through six centers

26:47.986 --> 26:54.065
now on the physical side we suffer because our centers are out of real

26:55.966 --> 26:57.966
extreme living

27:05.415 --> 27:11.435
So Kundalini what she does, these are the centers so the left and right sympathetic

27:11.836 --> 27:14.015
they combine and form a center like this in the spinal chord

27:15.436 --> 27:16.606
spinal chord

27:16.606 --> 27:21.785
and what happens if you start thinking too much on right side because you are very futuristic planning time

27:22.366 --> 27:26.375
Journalist use later like that and so we start would be more towards the right

27:27.046 --> 27:30.336
All right those are very emotional type they go towards left

27:32.145 --> 27:37.835
Sometimes something can happen they just break and things like cancer [UNCLEAR] what you got?

27:38.625 --> 27:42.335
Psychosomatic diseases can be caused this kind of imbalance left

27:42.336 --> 27:48.366
not that even if you are on the right or on the left if you go too far you might get those

27:48.946 --> 27:51.305
Psychosomatic which are supposed to be incurable

28:08.216 --> 28:13.756
Now this Kundalini what she does is she goes here and passes through here

28:13.756 --> 28:18.046
just like we put the beats into threads

28:18.836 --> 28:22.846
Into what you call threads in that it goes on threading all over

28:23.756 --> 28:26.506
So she integrates our center

28:27.326 --> 28:28.676
Let's see

28:28.676 --> 28:30.676
Normally if you want to do something

28:33.806 --> 28:41.206
You decide to do something, but really your intelligence will say no. Oh, maybe you're attention may not be there

28:43.316 --> 28:45.316
and then you become an integrated personality

28:47.006 --> 28:49.006
Whatever you do

28:49.376 --> 28:51.376
With your heart with your brain

28:52.826 --> 28:55.276
Complete integration. There's no problem

28:58.586 --> 29:03.705
First is that but what is the outward manifestation is that

29:05.336 --> 29:11.986
once she crosses over first dilatation of the pupils takes place isn't it kind of a

29:14.306 --> 29:16.256
in

29:16.256 --> 29:19.245
little shine in the eyes comes

29:24.546 --> 29:32.395
And then it pierces through here, which is that fontanel bone area which in our language we call it Talu?

29:33.816 --> 29:35.816
In Sanskrit its Talu

29:41.616 --> 29:45.866
this thing suddenly opens out and it comes out and

29:46.566 --> 29:51.566
That energy becomes one with the subtle energies all pervading power

29:53.166 --> 29:58.616
So now first we have to accept one is that first truth is

30:00.696 --> 30:06.415
That there is all-pervading power which does all the living work

30:11.076 --> 30:17.096
We never questioned who does living work. How do we grow how does the seed becomes a tree we never questioned

30:17.766 --> 30:19.766
accept it look at our eyes what a camera

30:21.486 --> 30:29.335
Look at our brain what a computer?We never bother question from where do we get this is done by this all-pervading divine

30:31.386 --> 30:33.386
second truth is

30:33.696 --> 30:37.946
That you are not this body mind intellect  you're not because it's my intellect

30:38.886 --> 30:41.036
You say my heart my body

30:42.396 --> 30:44.396
What is yourself?

30:45.096 --> 30:47.096
is the Spirit

30:47.856 --> 30:55.795
So you are the Spirit the rest is my this my that. My mother my sister my house my body my eyes

30:57.126 --> 31:03.925
So who is this my  - who is this I obviously saw through in this Spirit so this spirit

31:05.496 --> 31:07.446
you have to become

31:07.446 --> 31:13.976
So far your attention is on the body your attention is on your eyes and everything

31:14.646 --> 31:16.646
then what happens as

31:16.686 --> 31:19.256
if you watch a house from outside

31:19.956 --> 31:21.906
the beginning and

31:21.906 --> 31:25.436
Then they will go inside after inside you watch

31:27.966 --> 31:33.445
So the whole awareness becomes very different

31:34.746 --> 31:42.175
this we call Turiya in Sanskrit we call it as a Fourth dimension. We live in Three dimension. This is the fourth dimension we get

31:44.736 --> 31:50.935
the fourth Dimension, what do we get in that dimension is?

31:53.316 --> 31:55.316
firstly

31:55.686 --> 31:57.925
you stand in your present

31:59.676 --> 32:04.856
Now for Example you can think of the future or the past but in the present I say now be in the present you can't

32:07.775 --> 32:12.775
So what happens you become thoughtlessly aware you're aware, but absolutely no thought

32:14.016 --> 32:16.016
because thoughts come to

32:16.896 --> 32:18.396
you

32:18.396 --> 32:20.346
from the past

32:20.346 --> 32:22.346
or from the future

32:22.926 --> 32:25.766
In between these thoughts there is a little space

32:27.126 --> 32:29.575
so when this Kundalini rises she

32:31.176 --> 32:35.366
Makes that space, and that's the space is the present [UNCLEAR]

32:38.346 --> 32:43.585
And spiritual life you grow only in the present because that's truth

32:43.586 --> 32:46.886
You see the past is finished the future doesn't exist

32:48.366 --> 32:54.325
But in the present in the reality now is sitting me to be if the reality just number is it you don't know what will

32:54.326 --> 32:56.665
Happen in the future, or what her past finished

32:57.816 --> 33:01.466
So first in your dimension you become thoughtlessly aware

33:03.905 --> 33:06.985
but the second thing that happens to very wonderful

33:08.046 --> 33:10.046
That you start feeling

33:10.176 --> 33:13.736
This all-pervading power on your fingertips

33:16.596 --> 33:19.976
as very gently cool breeze on your finger tips

33:25.746 --> 33:33.595
Adi sankaracharya has called Salilam Satyam even Christ has said cool breeze of the holy ghost

33:35.856 --> 33:37.856
Kundalini is the reflection

33:38.556 --> 33:40.556
of

33:42.246 --> 33:46.675
Adi Shakti or holy ghost in human beings

33:56.256 --> 33:58.706
as a result of that you're all these

33:59.286 --> 34:00.786
sympathetically system

34:00.786 --> 34:05.245
You have an ending to the sympathetic nervous system the Left-hand side seven five

34:05.826 --> 34:07.536
six and seven

34:07.536 --> 34:09.536
five six and seven

34:09.966 --> 34:14.845
So the left side is emotional side right side is your physical and mental side

34:19.206 --> 34:24.325
we will give you the books so it is easy for you know then you can start feeling

34:25.896 --> 34:28.795
Not only is power, but he start feeling others

34:29.526 --> 34:35.875
Americans they called it Vibes  they don't know what they mean by Vibes very good vibes actually vibes

34:37.806 --> 34:39.426
1972

34:39.426 --> 34:46.496
Mr.. Charlie said mother you get all these things listed or something as for. He said, they're writing down all your thing that

34:47.076 --> 34:49.076
is very good idea nothing wrong

34:53.286 --> 34:56.185
Awakening has to be done now first of all the main thing

34:56.436 --> 35:00.746
That has to be done if you just take my words and write it down. What is that?

35:00.746 --> 35:04.766
I don't want to become the monopoly of that. It's very good [UNCLEAR]

35:05.496 --> 35:07.615
The result of that okay now

35:08.226 --> 35:10.176
feel the centers of

35:10.176 --> 35:12.865
yourself so it's the self-knowledge and

35:13.416 --> 35:15.416
You can feel

35:15.786 --> 35:17.786
Center of others

35:18.156 --> 35:20.156
on your finger tips

35:21.486 --> 35:28.016
Can feel what's wrong with you? What's wrong with you. You don't have to tell anything you just know that this is wrong

35:29.256 --> 35:30.486
now

35:30.486 --> 35:32.486
somehow if I know

35:33.666 --> 35:35.756
how to correct this centers you can be cured

35:38.196 --> 35:43.196
But all this is is mental physical emotion all of them are due to this

35:44.526 --> 35:50.575
And also spiritual problems, but if you put wrong gurus this that you get spiritual problems

35:53.646 --> 35:55.646
False people

36:04.246 --> 36:07.266
So a new dimension in your awareness comes

36:08.026 --> 36:11.915
called as collective consciousness collective

36:12.886 --> 36:14.886
Samuhik chetana

36:17.566 --> 36:19.566
So now who is other

36:20.386 --> 36:26.015
I Can feel you I can feel them and every eight so with them you become part and parcel of the whole

36:33.646 --> 36:35.975
and then another great thing at the side

36:36.616 --> 36:39.005
all your fingertips you can feel absolute truth

36:39.646 --> 36:42.875
absolute truth which cannot be challenged

36:45.076 --> 36:47.076
Absolute

36:48.046 --> 36:50.046
Say you have ten children

36:50.356 --> 36:53.315
they are realised soul and tie up their eyes

36:54.136 --> 36:59.075
Ask them. What's the matter of this lady

37:00.826 --> 37:02.945
they raise one finder. you ask the lady have you got throat trouble?

37:04.246 --> 37:06.246
Is how you know?

37:06.646 --> 37:08.646
because this finger is not right

37:10.636 --> 37:13.295
Everybody will say the same. I'm in a program

37:13.966 --> 37:18.726
one man came why everybody's asking what is your relationship with your father? What is really?

37:18.726 --> 37:23.435
Why we bother with my father I said its the center you are catching on your heart

37:25.246 --> 37:27.246
That's what they ask

37:28.006 --> 37:30.185
Everybody asking they feeling it

37:31.576 --> 37:33.576
So everybody feels the same

37:34.006 --> 37:40.145
And you want to know about anybody say about Christ. Was he a son of God? Just put your hands like this. suddenly it flows!

37:43.606 --> 37:49.055
But somebody is a thieves. or false man you put your hands

37:49.876 --> 37:54.696
just even if he's not in here you get burnings you get these little

37:55.966 --> 38:03.455
Things and he gets all you might even get sometimes you blisters so you become enlighten now imagine how fantastic

38:08.476 --> 38:13.925
This is outside and inside you can completely transformed

38:23.876 --> 38:26.835
We have people were supposed to be

38:32.576 --> 38:40.216
Like burning fire as far as the temper was concern they become now like himalayas suddenly

38:45.686 --> 38:49.515
People have changed apart from the health we of course

38:50.096 --> 38:52.016
We have definitely seen

38:52.016 --> 38:59.776
So many people world of blood cancer as ordinary cancer heart cancer so many. I mean there's so many them

39:00.566 --> 39:03.676
Rahul? - really when asked he had a massive heart attack

39:04.286 --> 39:09.466
And he got cured with Sahaja yoga you won't believe he went to houston and doctor shouted him

39:09.776 --> 39:12.046
So it is like that so many people have been cured

39:12.596 --> 39:15.015
but it's far anybody's power which cures

39:16.526 --> 39:21.015
It's your own this within you its your own power

39:26.666 --> 39:28.936
as a result of that power

39:30.506 --> 39:37.006
Which is actually is your own mother everybody has individual Kundalini own  mother and she gives you the new birth

39:38.696 --> 39:42.976
She looks after you... so this Kundalini will not only cure your incurable disease so many have been cured that you won't believe that now we have doctor in every country practising Sahaja yoga.

41:01.326 --> 41:03.326
Third one

41:04.086 --> 41:07.405
Third & Fourth  both came from TM

41:09.366 --> 41:12.385
Transmitting disease, but they developed

41:16.026 --> 41:20.276
issues homesexual even after getting cured they went back to same habit. so they got it back

41:22.596 --> 41:29.755
One fellow we still have who survived for 8 years for healthy is doing very well. He is in Australia

41:31.145 --> 41:35.785
The trouble with that age differences is they have no will power

41:41.896 --> 41:47.706
see what you call center hearth means they are so insecure so insecure

41:48.946 --> 41:54.425
That you see after getting cure also you have keep to certain [matya?]

41:55.396 --> 41:57.396
you have to be

41:57.796 --> 42:00.306
But they don't then then indulge into homosexuality

42:01.486 --> 42:03.486
or

42:08.146 --> 42:11.166
Outside will show we are like martyr

42:11.926 --> 42:13.926
inside they are very weak

42:14.086 --> 42:16.086
So it happens like that

42:16.276 --> 42:20.225
If they really want live they can if they really want to work it out they can

42:23.446 --> 42:27.335
But with Sahaja yoga you can never get AIDS that's one thing guaranteed

42:29.506 --> 42:31.506
Because all your priority changes

42:34.006 --> 42:38.646
in Sahaja Yoga the doctors are now

42:40.006 --> 42:42.396
really nobody goes to any doctor

42:46.215 --> 42:51.905
He knows all these things, but the doctors are finished as far as sahaja yogi's are concerned

42:52.876 --> 42:56.196
So at the most they might get some cold or something at most

42:57.646 --> 43:00.245
But they are so healthy

43:02.116 --> 43:04.116
They are so energetic that

43:07.066 --> 43:09.785
You can't imagine how a person could be like that

43:11.056 --> 43:16.956
[UNCLEAR]

43:19.336 --> 43:23.075
she get too much cold and rash and all those what you call allergy and and all

43:24.076 --> 43:30.186
Now is such a dynamic felow today he will be in Germany tomorrow in Japan he is so

43:31.636 --> 43:34.446
So healthy and so happy and so relaxed

43:36.826 --> 43:38.826
become absolutely a relaxed person

43:42.376 --> 43:48.755
It's balanced balanced very much and above all compassion very compassionate. Now all these Sahaja yogis

44:04.306 --> 44:06.306
they are swimming in ocean of Joy but what their headache is that mother why not have more people remain in ocean of Joy. I'm all the time travelling I went to south America I'm 70 years I'm travelling all over

44:20.806 --> 44:22.806
all the time but what I'm going to do If people want to come I have to do this but if but people want to come I will have to but people they don't want to come what can I do? so this is trouble they so anxious more to come and they are running up and down all over the world they are running here to there. they are trying to find more people. Even in Maharastra we goto villages bringing people. so it a country wide propagation.

45:21.466 --> 45:26.106
But you see actually got detached about it that you don't worry about your health

45:26.566 --> 45:30.275
you don't worry about your age  you don't even think of it

45:31.996 --> 45:36.006
you feel very Young and all the time the active over this just don't feel for it

45:38.236 --> 45:46.056
There is no group like young, old. We all enjoyed together. Whatever maybe there is a small boy

45:47.185 --> 45:54.854
adult that doesn't exist. also that doesn't exist in religion as far as the outside religion nothing, for example we worship Rama

45:55.766 --> 45:57.266
We worship Shri Krishna

45:57.266 --> 46:01.905
Also, be worship Mohammad Saheb because he was Dattatreya. They don't know but we know

46:03.266 --> 46:05.266
He was Dattatreya

46:07.046 --> 46:13.095
And Fathima we worship because she came as Sita latter on, so we worship we know that

46:15.536 --> 46:17.536
It's not just

46:17.665 --> 46:19.435
Sarva Dharma Sambhav

46:19.435 --> 46:25.485
Even Gandhiji was not like this the way these people work. Gandhiji in his prayers

46:25.486 --> 46:29.895
I was with him from my child actually I helped him in writing his

46:31.195 --> 46:36.765
Sequels of [UNCLEAR] all about Kundalini we wrote. He was a realised soul

46:38.306 --> 46:44.326
But we were fighting for freedom that time and he said without freedom what is the use of Spirituality

46:50.786 --> 46:52.786
so Gandhiji

46:57.836 --> 47:03.915
if he was living today he would have definitely helped me a lot. Even Lal bahadur shastri was a realised soul

47:06.865 --> 47:08.865
we are very unfortunate. we lost them

47:17.395 --> 47:19.395
Gurbachan?

47:21.025 --> 47:26.264
Gurbachan is realised soul? yes, he was a realised soul.

47:34.645 --> 47:36.645
But his wife you know you see?!. He is very high level person. Very good person. He has done his job.No doubt.

47:43.525 --> 47:45.525
so now this, I was tell you about

47:52.125 --> 47:54.125
Mohammed?

47:56.176 --> 47:57.316
Gandhiji?

47:57.316 --> 47:59.945
he was a realized soul, no doubt! and he

48:00.586 --> 48:05.735
He was the one who believed in Sarva Dharma Sambhav

48:06.916 --> 48:09.245
In his Sarva Dharma Sambhav

48:10.366 --> 48:12.666
He made everyone worship

48:14.716 --> 48:15.976
everyone

48:15.976 --> 48:17.316
like Muslim

48:17.316 --> 48:20.406
Maybe a congress man or anybody used to come to Ashram

48:21.166 --> 48:23.735
He had to say the Mantras of Shri Ganesha

48:24.826 --> 48:27.096
He have to take a Mantras of Vishnu

48:28.336 --> 48:29.746
Saraswathi

48:29.746 --> 48:34.175
You see it starts with the first of all

48:34.486 --> 48:38.046
whatever in my my heart [UNCLEAR] resides the Spirit

48:38.446 --> 48:43.685
See with the Spirit then he starts with Ganesh and every deity then he goes to the

48:45.496 --> 48:50.705
Quran and you have to say the quranic and then you have to say also this

48:51.646 --> 48:53.646
from the another

48:54.376 --> 48:56.376
Farsi

48:57.856 --> 48:59.146
Yes

48:59.146 --> 49:01.146
all that matters

49:01.726 --> 49:03.726
So you have to worship to all of them

49:04.036 --> 49:09.906
He followed [UNCLEAR] said see if you just say Sambav means you don't worship why don't you worship?

49:11.566 --> 49:14.856
Everybody should worship to follow them because they are different

49:15.736 --> 49:18.276
They are not politicians or anything

49:19.126 --> 49:23.975
They are not religious Christ has said those who are not against us, are with us.

49:25.306 --> 49:28.475
Even Mohammed saheb said also there have been 1 lac of Nabis

49:29.986 --> 49:33.066
He respected Christ mother more than all Deity

49:35.566 --> 49:37.566
Christ father

49:37.846 --> 49:39.846
He says she's a holy woman

49:40.906 --> 49:43.805
but Paul is the one who ruined Christianity

49:46.426 --> 49:48.426
so much, we said

49:52.036 --> 49:55.056
Human beings are very good ruining everything sublime or somehow or other they manage it.

49:59.816 --> 50:01.816
if you see through a essence of christ

50:02.526 --> 50:07.165
As I told you now, alpha and omega, Christ resides in our Agnya chakra

50:08.196 --> 50:10.196
on the six center. Christ very important

50:22.576 --> 50:26.015
yeah, on the optic chiasm.

50:28.036 --> 50:34.116
There is on one side is the pituitary and the another side is

50:34.846 --> 50:36.106
the

50:36.106 --> 50:38.106
pineal body

50:39.406 --> 50:41.406
pituitary looks after our Ego

50:43.306 --> 50:45.306
of the whole of up down working

50:46.186 --> 50:49.805
And the pineal body towards our conditionings

50:58.126 --> 51:00.126
In Chinese its Yin, Yang

51:02.086 --> 51:09.216
So one is Ego and another is Super ego

51:09.976 --> 51:11.266
psychological terminology

51:11.266 --> 51:18.995
So one is the ego and another is the conditioning so these two balloons go up like this gradually

51:20.806 --> 51:22.806
so when they cover us we are cut off

51:23.896 --> 51:29.285
as children Beyond one, but we don't feel but we are one, but when the Kundalini connect us

51:30.946 --> 51:37.385
then only you can feel it. Now you see for example this instrument or whatever you have to put it to the mains otherwise it doesn't work

51:39.496 --> 51:41.796
So you can call this as Kundalini

51:43.336 --> 51:45.336
Which is in a coil?

51:45.766 --> 51:49.956
And some other threads come up open Sahastrara and conects

51:59.136 --> 52:01.136
It's subtle very subtle

52:03.006 --> 52:05.006
How do we live?

52:05.556 --> 52:07.556
we live in three Dimensions

52:08.286 --> 52:10.286
like I

52:11.496 --> 52:14.756
Am here, and I'm looking at the mirror

52:16.386 --> 52:24.265
So I'm the one who is observing my reflection is what I'm observing

52:25.836 --> 52:30.896
There is a action of observance, so there is the observer

52:31.926 --> 52:36.926
observed and also the observance, which is the Kriya

52:38.616 --> 52:41.275
activity that we live in this three

52:42.666 --> 52:45.535
But supposing you become the mirror

52:47.736 --> 52:49.736
suppose

52:49.776 --> 52:51.776
Then all these things drop out

52:54.186 --> 53:00.446
This is what is called witness state where you just watch,

53:01.746 --> 53:03.746
the whole thing is Drama

53:04.446 --> 53:09.715
But when we are not realised we get lost in the drama

53:20.946 --> 53:22.946
[HINDI]

53:22.946 --> 53:24.946
[HINDI]

53:25.626 --> 53:29.246
[HINDI]

53:31.296 --> 53:32.766
[HINDI]

53:32.766 --> 53:34.596
so we become

53:34.596 --> 53:36.716
Ourselves means we know ourselves

53:37.356 --> 53:39.506
we don't have to take the mirror, we know ourself

53:42.606 --> 53:44.606
to know yourself is the only point

53:51.726 --> 53:53.755
And this is our heritage

53:55.476 --> 54:03.145
this is the import point we Indian must understand. when they come you know they come and touch our mother land and say Namaskar

54:06.366 --> 54:10.345
Some of them kiss these foreigners

54:12.936 --> 54:16.855
the respect! Because they know what it is. I send them to Devagudu Thukaram place

54:18.156 --> 54:19.326
and

54:19.326 --> 54:22.706
other Sahaja yogis told me that mother they are rolling on the ground

54:22.706 --> 54:28.525
so I said what were you doing, they said mother all over mother earth this vibrations coming out. so we are rolling on-it.

54:36.276 --> 54:41.096
[HINDI]

54:43.596 --> 54:45.596
[HINDI]

54:46.086 --> 54:48.356
[HINDI]

54:50.436 --> 54:52.436
[HINDI]

54:53.436 --> 54:56.755
overnight people have given up drug, drug addicts

54:57.396 --> 54:59.106
Alcoholics

54:59.106 --> 55:00.396
overnight

55:00.396 --> 55:02.396
[HINDI]

55:02.526 --> 55:07.226
[HINDI]

55:10.146 --> 55:12.146
but if overnight a

55:12.666 --> 55:19.555
[HINDI]

55:25.856 --> 55:28.975
They have really become righteous they really become religious

55:31.536 --> 55:33.536
[HINDI]

55:33.846 --> 55:35.965
[HINDI]

55:37.266 --> 55:39.266
[HINDI]

55:40.296 --> 55:42.715
Because once you get the light, you know what it is that?

55:43.506 --> 55:48.745
if you have snake in the hand if you are in the darkness you can't see, you can say its just a rope

55:48.746 --> 55:52.766
once you get the light, you just leave it, because you know its a snake

55:53.826 --> 55:55.826
that's what happens to them

56:01.416 --> 56:03.416
[HINDI]

56:03.906 --> 56:07.495
they become strong

56:09.246 --> 56:11.246
[HINDI]

56:12.876 --> 56:19.166
they give up aggressiveness. they are not aggressive. In their silence they become powerful

56:20.976 --> 56:23.336
My husband always used to say that [HINDI]

56:24.456 --> 56:26.456
But you cannot make anybody?

56:27.216 --> 56:29.996
Now he says so many angels now he has to accept

56:35.166 --> 56:37.616
I had to work out our years together

56:38.496 --> 56:44.965
What is the problem why we cannot have a amass realisation the time has come then I worked it out

56:51.716 --> 56:55.665
In our country especially the young generation has no destination

56:56.906 --> 56:58.906
They don't know what to do with themselves

56:59.546 --> 57:01.546
[HINDI]

57:03.806 --> 57:07.065
if they take to Sahaja Yoga now see in our Sahaja yoga

57:07.706 --> 57:08.876
Yuva sakthi

57:08.876 --> 57:10.876
nobody than it worked

57:11.066 --> 57:13.066
all boys get first class first

57:14.036 --> 57:15.986
All

57:15.986 --> 57:17.986
wherever they are educated

57:19.646 --> 57:21.946
all girls get married now we also have marriage system

57:28.706 --> 57:30.706
84 Marriage, 13 Indian from Pune. They are all abroad.

57:47.336 --> 57:53.416
So many boys got marriage and in abroad.

58:09.026 --> 58:12.526
Mataji, you take personal interest in the marriage alliances?

58:16.256 --> 58:21.915
[HINDI]

58:25.016 --> 58:29.115
[HINDI]

58:30.415 --> 58:32.415
[HINDI]

58:33.595 --> 58:36.675
Mean I'm just saying there hello

58:47.246 --> 58:52.065
I'm just telling them how you people are married to Indian boys and how Indian girls are married

58:53.486 --> 58:55.486

58:56.575 --> 59:01.395
And how you are enjoying your life, it's good. She coaches together

01:00:30.246 --> 01:00:33.116
[HINDI]

01:00:59.796 --> 01:01:05.755
A dog doesn't think [UNCLEAR] only human beings think. We think we are doing it.

01:01:06.725 --> 01:01:09.805
The whole ego and the Super-ego both of them are sucked

01:01:11.676 --> 01:01:13.676
And all your karma's are finished

01:01:15.725 --> 01:01:18.145
One goes Beyond the influence of planets. Yes

01:01:22.326 --> 01:01:24.326
of course

01:01:27.066 --> 01:01:31.525
Human destiny go after not after realisation, do you they affect? In the beginning may be

01:01:35.646 --> 01:01:37.646
before not after

01:01:38.946 --> 01:01:42.775

Lot of beauty within yourself lot of glory. All knowledge

01:05:06.605 --> 01:05:08.605
See actually

01:05:09.635 --> 01:05:11.635
our experience in ourselves

01:05:12.665 --> 01:05:14.665
Something that is small

01:05:15.095 --> 01:05:17.095
We don't think what we are seeing

01:05:17.945 --> 01:05:23.245
for example if you take television in our remove villages and show them and tell them this is very fantastic television.

01:05:27.725 --> 01:05:34.914
You put to mains, the whole glory comes up. Wonderful

01:05:39.095 --> 01:05:41.155
self-confidence,[HINDI]
