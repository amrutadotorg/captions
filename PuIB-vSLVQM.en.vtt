00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:16.139
...that Sahaja Yoga is first to start your
germination, then it grows.

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:27.050
In that growth, you have to become a wider
personality and a wider personality.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.950
With the marriage you become even a better
person, and you develop a better personality.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:41.260
Now, why marriage is necessary for Sahaja
Yogis?

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.290
First and foremost thing, it is the most normal
thing to do, is to marry.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.620
God has given you this desire to be married
for some purpose.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:01:05.180
But, the same desire, if you do not use it
for the purpose it is given, it can become

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.780
a perversion, it can become a nasty thing.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.210
It can be very detrimental to your growth.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:25.200
So one should understand this desire within
us to have a marriage.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.190
Marriage means a wife, who is a part and parcel
of your being.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.490
A wife on whom you can depend.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.490
She’s your mother, she’s your sister,
she’s your child, she’s everything.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.970
You can share all your feelings with your
wife.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.130
So it is important that the wife should be
such, that she should understand that this

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.740
is the need of a marriage.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.250
Now, in Sahaja Yoga, as you have seen, all
of you have problems either of the left or

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.250
the right.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:17.310
Now, when these marriages will take place,
mostly spontaneously, it will happen by the

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:27.599
nature’s plan itself, that you will marry
a person who is a complementary personality

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:28.599
to you.

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.030
Because, supposing you are a Left-sided person,
and if you have a person who has a Left Side

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.209
that is very strong, it will compensate, and
that’s how you make a good marriage.

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.099
But, for that, one thing is very important:
that you must share.

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.519
You must share life, every bit of it, every
moment of it.

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:54.880
If you do not know how to share life, it’s
going to be very, very difficult.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.310
When it comes to love, how do we express our
love?

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:07.840
By sharing all of our joys and all of our
pains, all of our problems.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.880
But in Sahaja Yoga, it’s a little more,
I think quite a lot more, much more.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.330
Here you have to share the community.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.249
The marriage is not for individuals, in Sahaja
Yoga, not at all.

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:26.840
If anybody has this feeling that the marriage
is between two persons in Sahaja Yoga, it’s

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.840
a wrong thing.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.569
It is two communities, it can be two nations,
it can be completely two universes.

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.709
So, it is not to be enjoyed between yourself.

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.550
If you are a good husband-wife to each other
it’s not sufficient in Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.609
That love should be enjoyed by everyone else,
in the society, in the community.

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.999
If you cannot do that, then you have not achieved
Sahaja Yoga marriage.

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:57.300
It’s just an ordinary marriage as people
have; it’s just nothing special about it.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:07.749
Such marriage should be able to give chances
for very great souls to come on this earth.

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:16.730
A person who is married in Sahaja Yoga, who
are Sahaja Yogis, who are sharing their love

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:29.390
equally with the Sahaja Yogis and the society
that is Sahaja Yoga, then only great people

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.390
will be born.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.540
I would say Bogdan has done that.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.610
Bogdan and Mandy, they have done it.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.190
It’s something surprising.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:43.380
You see, they were engaged before marriage,
they were married before Sahaja Yoga, they

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.730
were married after Realisation and I don’t
know how, it is clicked in their life, that

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.740
they really share companionship with other
Sahaja Yogis.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.980
Whenever he writes to me, he always writes
about other Sahaja Yogis, he’ll ask about

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.300
every one of them, how are they, what are
their problems.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.100
Unless and until it happens, the marriage
has no meaning in Sahaja Yoga, at all, no

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.100
meaning.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.950
So, first test of a Sahaja Yogi marriage is
that, how much you have been able to share

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.820
by this marriage, other people.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:25.220
Now, for example, in a normal marriage, a
man is the person who is the head of the family,

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.100
as you say.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.190
Now, he has to be the head, the man has to
be head for certain reasons.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:39.580
There is nothing wrong in man becoming the
head, it’s all right: you become the heart.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.970
Heart is more important than head is.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.160
Perhaps, we do not realise that how heart
is important.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.760
You see, even if the head fails, the heart
can go on.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.220
We can go on always up till the heart is going
on.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.640
But, if the heart fails, the head fails too.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:05.780
So you are the heart as a woman, and he is
the head of the family.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.800
Let him have that feeling that he is the head;
it’s a feeling, just a feeling.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.150
Like the head always feels that he decides.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:18.120
But, it’s the brain that also knows that
it’s the heart one has to cater for.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.430
It’s the heart which is all-pervading, which
is the real source of everything.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:28.650
So the woman’s position, if she understands
how important it is, she would never feel

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.901
let down or dominated if she knows she’s
the heart.

00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:37.550
I think this is the point people, women, especially
in the West, have lost and have forgotten

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.100
and have not realised.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.600
If they had realised this point, there would
have been much less problem.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:49.890
It is not the way people think they control
others and dominate others or sort of try

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:55.190
to suppress them: it is not that way.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:00.170
It is the heart which really governs everything.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.690
Heart rules out everything else.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:12.450
It is heart which has got the power to envelope
the brain, to sooth it.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:17.690
Brain is a headache, you know, it works, works
like mad.

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:25.640
But, heart is the one which can really cover
the whole body with its love and can soothe

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.820
it and can give it joy and happiness.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.650
It is the heart which contains the Spirit.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:36.730
So, heart is a very important thing, which
is the power of he body.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:40.680
Like ultimately you have to become the Spirit,
which is in the heart.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.510
With brain you know things and that’s why
the man has to be the head.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:48.950
He has to go out, he has to work, he has to
deal with people.

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:52.140
His life is, he’s an extrovert, as you call
it.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:56.390
And woman also has to work sometimes if there
is difficulties and troubles.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:08:02.120
But a woman should not feel dominated, if
the man says, “All right you don’t work."

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.140
But if he says it in love.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:10.530
Now, if the brain starts dominating the heart
too much, what will happen?

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.800
Then there will be dryness.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.830
Like, many men are very meticulous, very particular.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:24.510
They are headaches; absolute headaches to
themselves, to others and to the whole society.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:29.640
Such people can become extremely dry and they
can be all the time.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.990
They can never enjoy their wives, they can
never enjoy their children, they cannot enjoy

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.909
anything whatsoever, because they are so particular.

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:38.190
Like they said, “Come at 5:10”.

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:43.310
Now, if you reach there at 5:09 or 5:11, you
had it!

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:48.800
They are just watching time, just to find
out the faults: as soon as the wife comes,

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.390
they’ll be shouting, “What?

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:51.970
You’ve come so late!”

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:52.970
How many?

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:53.970
45 seconds!

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:54.970
Lost!

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:59.569
You see, the is wife coming, the expectancy,
the meeting of it, the joy of it.

00:08:59.569 --> 00:09:02.269
You are going to meet your own heart!

00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:03.990
[This] is lacking.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.829
Now this brain can go all off the rule, it
can go.

00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:10.890
And it can be very, very taxing.

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.230
It creates tremendous problems within.

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:22.360
So, heart must be respected, heart must be
obeyed, that’s the point.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.360
Heart must be obeyed.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.000
But, that doesn’t mean that the women should
dominate men.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.139
It doesn’t mean that.

00:09:27.139 --> 00:09:30.620
Obeyed means you must understand what your
love says.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.509
Do it in love.

00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:35.139
If you do it in love, it’s very good.

00:09:35.139 --> 00:09:37.300
For example I am lecturing you morning till
evening.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.060
You are not tired of my lectures.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.070
Normally people should be, “What’s this
sermon going on?

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:44.430
This lady all the time talking to us?”

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.970
But, you do not mind it for one reason.

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:47.970
Why?

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:50.769
Because you know I love you very much.

00:09:50.769 --> 00:09:55.709
In the same way the woman must establish the
role that she loves.

00:09:55.709 --> 00:09:57.889
The man may become a little funny, but he’ll
come around.

00:09:57.889 --> 00:10:02.449
He’ll go a little astray but, he’ll come
around.

00:10:02.449 --> 00:10:06.629
But, do not judge him in outward dominations.

00:10:06.629 --> 00:10:09.920
Like, you see, if he says, “This colour
is not good”, “All right, whatever you

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.519
like I’ll put it”.

00:10:11.519 --> 00:10:14.019
Then he himself will say, “Oh, I think the
one you had put was good.

00:10:14.019 --> 00:10:19.559
You know I was really foolish!” (laughter)
He would say like that!

00:10:19.559 --> 00:10:20.949
You just agree to them!

00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:23.040
I mean I have experimented this in my own
life.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.160
I have done it.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:30.930
For example, my husband doesn’t know much
of roads, so, supposing we are going somewhere,

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.920
and he said, “I think this is the way you
have to go."

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.399
I said, “All right you can go ahead and
I will walk with you."

00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:40.230
But I said, “No, but I think it’s not
the road, I’ll have to walk again back I

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:41.230
know for definite.

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:42.980
But, all right, if you want, I can walk with
you.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:43.980
All right I’m walking.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:44.980
I am just enjoying.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:48.100
I may have to go this way only."

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.699
Then he starts wondering, “Is it true?

00:10:51.699 --> 00:10:52.720
Is it correct?”

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:58.240
(laughter) Then he starts thinking that, “Is
it really?”or “Maybe?”

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.980
Because she has instincts.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:05.100
She has intuition.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:12.899
She has so many things.

00:11:12.899 --> 00:11:20.990
She gets that hunch.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:22.189
They get a hunch.

00:11:22.189 --> 00:11:23.320
They get a hunch of it.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.819
And that’s what it is.

00:11:24.819 --> 00:11:30.059
And once they start understanding, that the
hunches of the wife is correct, then they

00:11:30.059 --> 00:11:31.779
follow her, in a way.

00:11:31.779 --> 00:11:34.889
But, what is so great in making your husband
follow you?

00:11:34.889 --> 00:11:35.889
It’s wrong.

00:11:35.889 --> 00:11:37.860
I think there is no need for him to follow.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.629
“You go this way!”

00:11:39.629 --> 00:11:41.939
What is the need to do all that?

00:11:41.939 --> 00:11:45.240
We are going the same way.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:49.581
But we must know that somebody is on the left,
one is on the right.

00:11:49.581 --> 00:11:51.079
The left has to be on the left.

00:11:51.079 --> 00:11:54.279
Supposing the left wheel starts going to the
right — we’ll have only one wheel left.

00:11:54.279 --> 00:11:56.509
What are we going to do about it?

00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:59.630
We are all going on the same way!

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:02.059
There are no two ways about it.

00:12:02.059 --> 00:12:04.389
There are two wheels needed to give it a balance.

00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:06.570
But we are going on the same way.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:10.470
This, people don’t realise: they think one
wheel has to go on the right and another has

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:11.520
to turn to the left.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.890
So, imagine what will be the condition of
such a family.

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:17.260
We are going on the same way.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.189
Only understanding is needed.

00:12:19.189 --> 00:12:25.660
That one has to live with the powers of heart,
and another has to live with the powers of

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.009
rationality, of understanding.

00:12:28.009 --> 00:12:32.879
Now, when it comes to rationality, ultimately
it will turn to heart.

00:12:32.879 --> 00:12:35.160
Because it reaches a point where it does not
know.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.189
Then it comes to heart.

00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:41.029
Once women realise this, that they have this
within themselves.

00:12:41.029 --> 00:12:43.970
But, you must nurture your power of heart.

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:48.160
But you compete with them in everything: “If
he goes on the horse why can’t I?”

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.949
“He does this, why can’t I?”

00:12:49.949 --> 00:12:52.079
“If he can drive, I can drive."

00:12:52.079 --> 00:13:03.190
Wisdom lies in doing things, many things by
avoiding them.

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:05.820
For example, I don’t drive, so everybody
drives me along.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.339
I don’t type, very good: everybody types
for me.

00:13:08.339 --> 00:13:12.519
But, I do some things which nobody can do
as well as I can do.

00:13:12.519 --> 00:13:14.100
Like I can cook very well.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.029
So when it comes to cooking, they have to
come to me!

00:13:17.029 --> 00:13:18.029
It’s like that.

00:13:18.029 --> 00:13:20.459
But, you don’t do everything that the men
want to do.

00:13:20.459 --> 00:13:22.610
Or you don’t do everything women want to
do.

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:26.709
For men, will be cooking and women will be
driving, is a wrong thing.

00:13:26.709 --> 00:13:31.290
Men should know all manly things and women
should know womanly things.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:32.290
They must learn.

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:34.860
They must put their heart into it.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:40.690
I mean women can be equally intelligent, men
can be equally intelligent.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:45.009
Women can go on to the right hand, and men
can go on the left hand.

00:13:45.009 --> 00:13:46.019
No doubt about it.

00:13:46.019 --> 00:13:50.970
But, you put imbalance to the whole universe
by that, that’s the point.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:56.550
It’s not that by doing that you are in any
way less or more.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:59.389
This idea should go out of your minds absolutely.

00:13:59.389 --> 00:14:02.509
That men think that, “Oh, I’m the man
who wears the pants!”

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:05.209
All right, you wear the pants but, we wear
the beautiful skirts!

00:14:05.209 --> 00:14:09.160
That’s the way it should be looked after.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:14.300
Once this goes away, Sahaja Yoga will work
out better.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:19.230
The domination only is felt when there is
no love.

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:21.879
Sometimes you like people to dominate you,
isn’t it.

00:14:21.879 --> 00:14:23.839
For example, let’s say, “Come along, have
this food.

00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:25.579
You must eat, you must have this."

00:14:25.579 --> 00:14:30.679
You like it, because somebody cares for you:
there’s a concern, somebody loves you, wants

00:14:30.679 --> 00:14:33.110
you to have this and wants you to do that.

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:34.660
You like such a person.

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.259
You want somebody to do that.

00:14:36.259 --> 00:14:39.839
You do not want to be left to dogs that: “Do
whatever you please!”

00:14:39.839 --> 00:14:42.749
That kind of thing is no good.

00:14:42.749 --> 00:14:46.009
And once you develop that feeling that, “Oh,
that the person cares for me.

00:14:46.009 --> 00:14:47.119
That person loves."

00:14:47.119 --> 00:14:50.839
Then you also start caring for the feelings
of that person.

00:14:50.839 --> 00:14:52.019
You also start to understand.

00:14:52.019 --> 00:14:53.269
Now again the guilt is working.

00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:56.040
Now will you please stop feeling guilty about
anything.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:01.949
I do not say these things to make you feel
guilty, but just to understand that you have

00:15:01.949 --> 00:15:05.829
to be in a very light mood, in a very light
mood.

00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:14.189
This balance has been created long time back,
a very long time back.

00:15:14.189 --> 00:15:20.000
Even when Radha Krishna existed: Radha was
the power and Krishna was the one who was

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.929
expressing.

00:15:21.929 --> 00:15:23.740
As you say, the potential and the kinetic.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:27.160
And people only know about Krishna, but Radha
was the power.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:31.949
When He had to kill Kamsa, He had to ask Radha,
to do it.

00:15:31.949 --> 00:15:34.429
It was She who did everything, She had to
dance and He pressed Her feet.

00:15:34.429 --> 00:15:36.110
He said, “Now You must be tired."

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:37.559
I mean, why did She dance?

00:15:37.559 --> 00:15:42.769
Because without Her dancing, things could
not work out.

00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:45.610
So, it is so interdependent.

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:47.680
It is so interdependent.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.489
As you cannot have a wick, and you cannot
have the light.

00:15:51.489 --> 00:15:53.829
You cannot have these two things separate.

00:15:53.829 --> 00:16:00.850
If you can understand that, then this balance
is completely harmonious.

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:04.110
It is between God and His power: absolutely
one.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:12.519
You can’t imagine, how it is one with God
and His power.

00:16:12.519 --> 00:16:15.899
His power, His desire, is the same as God.

00:16:15.899 --> 00:16:17.689
There’s no difference at all.

00:16:17.689 --> 00:16:20.579
But, in human beings you are disintegrated
people.

00:16:20.579 --> 00:16:25.399
Your desire is different, your thinking is
different, your asking is different.

00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:28.010
Everything is so disintegrated, that’s why
you cannot understand.

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:30.420
That’s why marriages are also disintegrated.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.029
[It’s] the complete integration.

00:16:32.029 --> 00:16:33.029
Is the intermingling.

00:16:33.029 --> 00:16:35.339
If the wife has to work, one need not worry.

00:16:35.339 --> 00:16:41.009
If the man has to work, doesn’t worry: as
long as there is complete understanding of

00:16:41.009 --> 00:16:44.189
integration, of balance, within you.

00:16:44.189 --> 00:16:49.269
Of course, the women are responsible [for
the] grace of the family.

00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:52.279
She has to be gracious.

00:16:52.279 --> 00:16:56.899
It doesn’t look nice for a woman to behave
like a man because, man need not be that gracious

00:16:56.899 --> 00:16:58.259
as the woman is.

00:16:58.259 --> 00:16:59.589
He is after all a man.

00:16:59.589 --> 00:17:00.730
So, its all right.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:07.709
I mean, in his behaviour, he need not be atrocious
but sometimes if he swears sometimes, doesn’t

00:17:07.709 --> 00:17:10.390
matter, sometimes, in a way: for a man.

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:14.520
But, for a woman, it does because she is a
gracious thing.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:20.269
But, there are some things that a man cannot
do: like, taking interest in women.

00:17:20.269 --> 00:17:24.610
Some men are so hot you know, horrible and
absolutely, one can’t understand the way

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:26.850
they take interest in women.

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:29.510
What dresses women wear sort of thing.

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:32.650
All this rat-like behaviour, it’s horrible.

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:35.260
And this cannot be manly.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.810
That means that they are such slaves of women.

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:41.250
They may call themselves something this and
that.

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:43.500
I heard this Mrs.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.110
Kennedy’s clothes, under clothes, were for
sale.

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:49.050
And people from Australia were flying out
to buy them!

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.950
And I mean think of these men.!What do you
call them?

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:54.190
I don’t know what do you call them in English
language.

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:56.039
But, they are just worst than earthworms.

00:17:56.039 --> 00:17:57.860
I don’t know from where they come.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:59.909
So a man has to be a man!

00:17:59.909 --> 00:18:02.289
And man is a person like Rama is.

00:18:02.289 --> 00:18:04.799
You have heard about his life, how He was.

00:18:04.799 --> 00:18:08.330
How He loved His wife, respected His own chastity.

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:12.220
A man who cannot respect his own chastity
is not a man.

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.690
He is absolutely an earthworm.

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:16.070
So, this is what it is.

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:21.220
A man has to have a character, he has to have
that chivalry in him, he has to have that

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.980
courage in him, he has to have that protective
thing.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:28.490
If thieves come in the house [and] the man
tell the wife, “Oh you go and open the door,

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:32.399
and I am going to hide!” (laughter) And
when the thieves go away, he says, “I’m

00:18:32.399 --> 00:18:34.420
going dominate!” that’s not the way.

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.980
The man has to protect.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:37.980
The man has to look after.

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.530
That’s why it doesn’t matter if he is
a little crude sometimes.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:42.530
It doesn’t matter.

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:43.530
Because he has to face.

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:48.120
He’s like a thorn and women are like the
flowers.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:52.610
Now, in the thorn and flower, you would like
to be a flower, isn’t it, but, in a man

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:55.360
and woman, you would like to be a thorn!

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.779
So it’s wrong.

00:18:56.779 --> 00:19:04.929
He has to protect, he has to look after the
invasions on the family-life and other things.

00:19:04.929 --> 00:19:11.610
On the contrary, they are the ones who allow
infiltration by wrong people in the family.

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:12.840
It’s the men.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:17.309
They bring in horrible women, they bring in
horrible people, through their domination,

00:19:17.309 --> 00:19:18.429
“Oh, she’s my friend!

00:19:18.429 --> 00:19:19.520
How can you object?”

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.860
But, what sort of friend is she?

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:25.000
He has to say, “No,I don’t like these
people to come in the house, they are not

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000
the right-type.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000
They have to get out."

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.960
It is he who has to say.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.120
And the woman has to understand.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.019
But if he says it just out of domination,
it is nonsense.

00:19:33.019 --> 00:19:37.760
So, everything has two sides, as you can see
clearly.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.760
If it is done in love, it’s perfect.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.399
But, if it is done in domination, it’s nonsensical.

00:19:42.399 --> 00:19:43.399
Why dominate?

00:19:43.399 --> 00:19:45.890
I mean, I don’t understand the word ‘domination’.

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:50.350
When there are two wheels do they dominate
each other?

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:51.350
Can they?

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:55.470
If one dominates, say one becomes bigger than
the other, it will go round and round, won’t

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:56.470
it.

00:19:56.470 --> 00:20:01.220
There’s no question in domination in this.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:06.100
But, it’s a question of integration and
understanding and complete cooperation within

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:10.730
themselves, which must permeate into the society,
into the family.

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:16.539
The marriages which are not helpful to the
society are of no use, they are just a waste,

00:20:16.539 --> 00:20:17.570
just a waste.

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:19.230
We have so many marriages like this.

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:23.740
People get married, live well, happily among
themselves and finish off.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:29.400
These are the marriages which are going to
change the society, with their joy, happiness,

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:34.140
make home where everybody is expected, look
after them, do for others.

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:39.190
There are many people who think that nobody
is doing anything for us: what have you done

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:40.190
for others?

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:41.190
What have you done?

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:44.200
Have you done anything for them?

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:52.350
This, once you start deciding and understanding,
it would be very good.

00:20:52.350 --> 00:21:00.450
Normally a woman is, if not brought up properly,
can be very, very conceited and can be very

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:02.500
selfish and self-centred.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.059
Men can be also, but, women can be.

00:21:05.059 --> 00:21:11.169
Because if they are not brought up properly
— I am saying that — they may not like

00:21:11.169 --> 00:21:13.120
to spend their money on others.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:18.080
They would not like others to come in the
house and share this and that.

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:22.500
But, again we have to judge it: is it done
in love or not?

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:26.860
Like the husband brings his friends, and they
may not like their friends coming in because

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:28.260
it means money.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:32.500
They would like to have more ornaments to
themselves, than to have some friends.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.720
It can be, they can be like that.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.450
Some men are like that also.

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:39.019
But, both the things are wrong.

00:21:39.019 --> 00:21:40.630
This should be shared to be understood.

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:45.860
And the whole things is that you must lavish
your love on others.

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:47.820
You need not spend money for that.

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:48.820
Need not.

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:52.980
You can just be kind to them, nice to them
and a little money too.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:57.549
There is not harm in spending a little money
for others and expressing your love.

00:21:57.549 --> 00:22:04.020
We are still very meticulous in our Sahaja
Yoga as far as money is concerned, as far

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:05.150
as love is concerned.

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:06.559
We are very, very cautious.

00:22:06.559 --> 00:22:10.230
We have so much of fear within us.

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:13.720
Now domination should never come in Sahaja
Yoga at all.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:20.080
For example, when I am telling you anything,
an outsider you might think I am dominating

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:25.440
you, because really I am touching very sore
points within you, if you see it clearly,

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.440
it is there.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:32.570
Putting the Left Side too much: You are all
feeling guilty, that’s not good, come along!

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:40.889
So, this is also an escape, that you start
feeling guilty and you then just don’t cure

00:22:40.889 --> 00:22:41.889
yourself.

00:22:41.889 --> 00:22:43.529
Just don’t feel guilty about anything.

00:22:43.529 --> 00:22:47.010
I am just telling you this because I have
to tell you!

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:53.659
Now, one can feel that this is domination,
if they do not see the love behind it, the

00:22:53.659 --> 00:22:56.630
beauty behind it, the compassion behind it.

00:22:56.630 --> 00:23:01.950
So, never to feel that anybody dominates you
is the best way.

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:03.130
How can you be dominated?

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:05.370
You are the Spirit!

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:09.860
Your ego can be hurt.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:13.080
You are the Spirit: it cannot be dominated.

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.110
But, are you the Spirit?

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:17.649
Are you feeling your Spirit?

00:23:17.649 --> 00:23:21.340
If you are feeling your Spirit you can never
be dominated, no one can dominate you.

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:25.451
But, if you feel that way, all the time, that
you are dominated you will become a very,

00:23:25.451 --> 00:23:26.740
very nervous person.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.620
You can be a horrible person.

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:31.360
You cannot face people.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:35.450
So it is time you realise you are a Spirit
and your husband is also a Spirit.

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:39.639
Or if you are the husband, you must know the
wife is also a Spirit.

00:23:39.639 --> 00:23:48.429
And a mutual respect must grow in that level,
because both of you are saints, you are Sahaja

00:23:48.429 --> 00:23:49.429
Yogis.

00:23:49.429 --> 00:23:53.659
You must respect each other because you are
Sahaja Yogis.

00:23:53.659 --> 00:23:58.929
Everybody respects you because you are Sahaja
Yogis — [those] who have not achieved Realisation:

00:23:58.929 --> 00:24:00.720
“oh, they are realised-souls."

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:05.820
You just think when you were not realised
if someone had told you that, “He is a realised-soul."

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:08.269
How you would have felt about that person.

00:24:08.269 --> 00:24:13.330
You are not conscious of that but you should
be conscious.

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:18.360
By that you should not become vain but you
must respect others, they are realised-souls,

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:24.710
they are the children of your Mother.

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:30.510
When talking to each other you have to understand
that: more so when you are husband and wife.

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:35.830
The whole understanding that you had so far
of husband-wife must be given up.

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:38.960
It is, I think a contract sort of a marriage.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.740
In a marriage you see, “How much he dominates?

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:42.740
What are his powers?

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:43.740
What are my powers?

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:45.440
How much money I get?

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.360
How much he gets, where’s the money kept?

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.820
What’s all that?”

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.669
It will only happen when you do not trust
each other.

00:24:52.669 --> 00:24:54.560
But, go on trusting more and more.

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.700
There should be a competition in loving.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:25:04.960
There should be a competition in trusting,
in being honest, in being kind, in being in

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:05.960
service.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:09.870
Let there be a competition like that, and
then you will achieve results.

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:14.170
The competition should be on the other side,
instead of dominating, instead of being afraid,

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:17.250
instead of sharing all nonsense.

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:21.610
There’s another thing which I must point
out which happens to married couples and which

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:27.280
is very, very wrong also: that both of them,
take up a role of very miserable people, the

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.280
Les Miserables!

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:32.100
They sit down, crying, weeping “Oh, ho,
ho!” for nothing at all.

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.909
[As if] the whole world is collapsing before
them.

00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:40.020
Now there are some ‘great’ poets, like
Lord Byron maybe or some horrible people,

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:42.260
who have written horrible poems like that.

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:46.240
And they will recite those poems, “The sweetest
songs are those [that tell of saddest thought]”

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.602
and all sorts of nonsense: not for Sahaja
Yogis.

00:25:48.602 --> 00:25:53.190
You are not to indulge in this kind of nonsense
and sitting down and indulging into this kind

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:57.270
of nonsense and enjoying the miseries of each
other.

00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:59.850
For the present, you have no miseries.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:02.980
Whatever has been there is past and finished.

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:06.279
Now, you are new people, with new awareness
with new things.

00:26:06.279 --> 00:26:07.280
You have no miseries.

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:11.019
So, forget all those things and try to enjoy
each other’s company.

00:26:11.019 --> 00:26:14.991
If you start doing that, sitting down and
enjoying the miseries: you [must] get out

00:26:14.991 --> 00:26:19.169
of it immediately and say, “Oh, We are getting
into the same play of Lord Byron!”

00:26:19.169 --> 00:26:23.200
I don’t want to create Lord Byrons out of
Sahaja Yogis any more.

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:28.559
So please remember that: don’t sit down
and discus and analyse your miseries.

00:26:28.559 --> 00:26:30.710
You have no miseries of any kind.

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:32.519
You are the Spirit.

00:26:32.519 --> 00:26:36.490
You are the source of joy for yourself and
for others and you have no business to sit

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:42.360
down and cry and weep and I don’t know what
is happening?

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.220
I don’t know why you don’t know your Spirit.

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:46.269
Don’t you know your Spirit?

00:26:46.269 --> 00:26:47.269
You know!

00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:48.269
Then why don’t you know?

00:26:48.269 --> 00:26:51.850
You have your vibratory awareness and still
how is it you are saying you don’t know?

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:54.200
You have to know everything.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:27:01.650
And it has to be a very positive act to be
happy to be fragrant with joy and to give

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:02.799
joy to others.

00:27:02.799 --> 00:27:04.539
That has to be with you.

00:27:04.539 --> 00:27:06.029
Otherwise, everything has no meaning.

00:27:06.029 --> 00:27:10.710
You see, I try my level best to make every
marriage a very pompous thing a very beautiful

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:19.450
thing but, ultimately, what I find is two
crumpled up people sitting down there sulking!

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:25.649
(laughing) And then imagine the children who
are going to be born.

00:27:25.649 --> 00:27:32.279
They will think, “What these sulking parents,
oh God, save us from these crying babies!”

00:27:32.279 --> 00:27:39.340
So don’t put my all hopes to my complete
shattering state, by this kind of attitude.

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:46.750
Now, if you have any questions, ask them because
I don’t know how far to say.

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:47.750
Close it.

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:48.609
