00:00:07.434 --> 00:00:13.534
Today is the happiest day

00:00:13.667 --> 00:00:18.000
for all of you, for the whole universe,

00:00:18.434 --> 00:00:22.934
because Shri Ganesha was created.

00:00:23.601 --> 00:00:29.868
He was created to emit auspiciousness

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.334
through His ‘Chaitanya’ [Hindi/Sanskrit meaning Divine Vibrations].

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:39.734
First, the whole cosmos was filled

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:45.834
with this ‘Chaitanyasrishti’ [Hindi/Sanskrit meaning creation of Divine Vibrations].

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.133
Then Brahma Deva came into play, and He created all the matter.

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.367
But

00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:21.067
the greatest blessings of the Divine Power

00:01:21.267 --> 00:01:26.234
was to symbolize ‘Chaitanya’,

00:01:29.501 --> 00:01:34.968
and this Chaitanya has many aspects,

00:01:36.434 --> 00:01:42.300
but specially in Shri Ganesha, it is auspiciousness.

00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:48.267
In these modern times, people have lost the sense of auspiciousness.

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:52.868
Everything that emits vibrations,

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.200
‘Chaitanya, is auspicious, is ‘Shubh’,

00:01:56.501 --> 00:02:03.100
and whatever does not, is not, by any chance, auspicious.

00:02:03.467 --> 00:02:08.067
So, first of all, whatever you worship,

00:02:08.534 --> 00:02:10.934
whatever you accept,

00:02:11.501 --> 00:02:14.501
all of them have to be auspicious things.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.667
Every shape has a coefficience and all these shapes, which you see,

00:02:21.801 --> 00:02:26.167
not necessarily give vibrations.

00:02:26.434 --> 00:02:28.834
But in the human beings, also,

00:02:28.934 --> 00:02:32.634
we find there are many people, like you,

00:02:32.801 --> 00:02:35.801
who have ‘Chaitanya’ flowing in them.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.767
But this ‘Chaitanya’ when it flows,

00:02:38.901 --> 00:02:43.133
we just take Shri Ganesha for granted.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.067
We do not understand

00:02:46.167 --> 00:02:49.167
that we have to awaken Shri Ganesha within us

00:02:49.267 --> 00:02:52.567
– means what? What we have to do?

00:02:52.701 --> 00:03:00.300


00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.901
To manifest Shri Ganesha,

00:03:05.267 --> 00:03:11.667
we have to do certain amount of Tapasya, Penance.

00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:15.868
First we have to say, when we sit for meditation,

00:03:16.067 --> 00:03:21.901
that, “I am going to be worthy of Your appreciation.

00:03:22.334 --> 00:03:29.133
Make me humble, so that I am appreciated by You,

00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:32.601
and my only desire is to please You”.

00:03:32.734 --> 00:03:36.367
Then you sit down in complete preparedness,

00:03:36.501 --> 00:03:41.133
meditating over your Mooladhara,

00:03:41.267 --> 00:03:44.634
putting your attention to it with absolute purity.

00:03:44.734 --> 00:03:51.601
Now you have my photograph before you and you tell the photograph that,

00:03:51.734 --> 00:03:55.868
“Mother, You are Shri Ganesha.

00:03:55.968 --> 00:04:01.634
You give me wisdom and discretion”.

00:04:01.968 --> 00:04:07.734
So, attention at the mooladhara chakra,

00:04:14.734 --> 00:04:17.000
which is actually below the sacrum bone.

00:04:17.133 --> 00:04:19.667
You put your right hand towards the photograph,

00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:26.567
and left hand on the Mother Earth.

00:04:26.667 --> 00:04:29.734
Now this will tell you that your mind,

00:04:32.234 --> 00:04:36.734
or your brain which is full of confusion,

00:04:36.968 --> 00:04:42.167
which has no discretion,

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.734
which is complicated,

00:04:46.033 --> 00:04:48.868
which does the same mistakes again and again,

00:04:49.167 --> 00:04:52.501
which does not understand how to cure

00:04:52.968 --> 00:04:58.634
the ills of bad feelings,

00:04:58.767 --> 00:05:04.667
all that can be cured if you

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.267
put your right hand towards me

00:05:09.367 --> 00:05:12.067
and the left hand towards the Mother Earth.

00:05:19.267 --> 00:05:25.000
He is the ‘essence’ of everything’ that is material,

00:05:25.133 --> 00:05:28.100
that has bhava , that has been created.

00:05:28.234 --> 00:05:30.601
He is the essence of everything that has been created.

00:05:30.734 --> 00:05:33.033
‘Through Him’ everything has been created.

00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:37.100
When you develop that, you develop your sense

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.434
of subtle creativity,

00:05:39.567 --> 00:05:44.033
and the sense of subtle appreciation of creativity.

00:05:44.133 --> 00:05:47.467
Then you develop your discretion of how to behave

00:05:47.601 --> 00:05:50.133
with others, in a beautiful manner,

00:05:50.234 --> 00:05:53.934
so that your ego is controlled.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.467
The behaviour should be such that there should be

00:05:58.634 --> 00:06:01.534
no expression of ego in your behaviour.

00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:14.033
Now, many people should try this thing:

00:06:14.167 --> 00:06:17.334
sitting in a group together, meditating,

00:06:17.467 --> 00:06:21.033
saying the mantra of Shri Ganesha, to try to build up.

00:06:21.133 --> 00:06:24.667
Those who think too much, they should also try to say

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:27.067
“Not this, not this, not this … “.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.534
Even the superego when it gives you thoughts,

00:06:29.634 --> 00:06:32.200
you should say “not this, not this, not this … “.

00:06:32.334 --> 00:06:35.167
So you will develop that state

00:06:35.267 --> 00:06:38.167
where you stand yourself: and nothing else.

00:06:45.434 --> 00:06:49.400
So the innocence plays, but it is not involved.

00:06:49.634 --> 00:06:52.734
It sees the play. Just sees.

00:06:52.868 --> 00:06:55.501
It enjoys the play.

00:06:55.734 --> 00:06:57.434
Just enjoys.

00:06:57.601 --> 00:07:01.267
So today when we are thinking of Shri Ganesha,

00:07:01.367 --> 00:07:04.667
let us desire that, “Within us

00:07:04.801 --> 00:07:10.734
His great power of innocence be enlightened”.

00:07:10.901 --> 00:07:19.868


00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.467
“That let my wisdom shine in my attention.

00:07:25.601 --> 00:07:33.400
Let Shri Ganesha throw His light in my attention”.

00:07:33.534 --> 00:07:38.667
Mentally you people are very alert, no doubt.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:49.300
And, you can always cheat yourself nicely.

00:07:50.968 --> 00:07:56.000
That’s the point where you could see yourself

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.734
– introspection,

00:07:59.901 --> 00:08:08.033


00:08:08.167 --> 00:08:13.300
Just introspect – ‘Why do I do like that?

00:08:13.734 --> 00:08:16.801
Why cannot I meditate?

00:08:17.033 --> 00:08:20.234
Am I going to miss out?

00:08:21.467 --> 00:08:24.434
Why can I not do

00:08:24.701 --> 00:08:29.234
something that is good for me?’

00:08:29.701 --> 00:08:36.567
Introspection is the only way you can see yourself

00:08:36.801 --> 00:08:39.434
how far you are from Shri Ganesh.

00:08:39.534 --> 00:08:49.434


00:08:49.534 --> 00:08:55.334
Even, I have seen, when I say something in general,

00:08:55.434 --> 00:08:57.000
people always

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.801
– the mind is very clever –

00:08:59.901 --> 00:09:04.701
thinks that I am talking about somebody else, not about them.

00:09:05.133 --> 00:09:08.167
It’s a convex mind, convex,

00:09:09.033 --> 00:09:12.667
which never receives anything inside itself

00:09:12.834 --> 00:09:16.200
because there is no wisdom.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.100
If you are wise,

00:09:21.968 --> 00:09:25.434
then not only that you will accept

00:09:25.567 --> 00:09:28.968
but you will understand and it will penetrate

00:09:29.067 --> 00:09:34.868
into your attention through your central nervous system.

00:09:34.968 --> 00:09:38.868
You just know that this is it.

00:09:41.234 --> 00:09:46.300
Now you know that this… you put your hand towards this candle, it…

00:09:46.434 --> 00:09:50.834
you’ll… your fingers might burn. You know it definitely, with experience,

00:09:51.567 --> 00:09:54.100
and you won’t do that.

00:09:54.234 --> 00:09:56.100
With experience you have learnt

00:09:56.234 --> 00:10:00.467
not to put hand… your hand on to the candle.

00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:05.901
And this wisdom is there; I don’t have to tell you that.

00:10:07.234 --> 00:10:11.567
But this is a new life you have started – a spiritual life.

00:10:11.701 --> 00:10:15.000
When you are going into the spiritual life,

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.734
try to remember your experiences,

00:10:19.067 --> 00:10:22.501
one after another – how you got transformed;

00:10:22.601 --> 00:10:26.367
how you changed; how many the bad things that you had

00:10:26.467 --> 00:10:30.934
disappeared gradually and how you have become so nice.

00:10:33.601 --> 00:10:39.167
This will take away your depression – to begin with.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:43.767
Then you should think that, ‘what do I have to do further?

00:10:43.901 --> 00:10:47.434
Am I really wise, or I am stupid?’

00:10:47.534 --> 00:10:56.701


00:10:56.801 --> 00:11:00.334
After getting your self-realization,

00:11:00.773 --> 00:11:05.307
when Shri Ganesha is shining in your attention,

00:11:05.601 --> 00:11:08.067
you should see your reflection clearly

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.100
and try to correct it.

00:11:12.534 --> 00:11:15.334
Only this much wisdom if you have that,

00:11:15.467 --> 00:11:19.734
‘I have to work out my benevolence,’ you’ll do it.
