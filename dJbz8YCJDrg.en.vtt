00:00:01.282 --> 00:00:06.807
I would switch on from the time, when we were just amoebae.

00:00:07.914 --> 00:00:09.885
Before that, what happened

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:14.774
and how we were created,
this universe was created, I’ll tell you tomorrow morning.

00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:25.027
It is not difficult to find out

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.062
how this universe is organized.

00:00:33.876 --> 00:00:40.979
Every scientist who is open minded can see for himself

00:00:42.813 --> 00:00:50.686
that this universe is a beautiful cosmos, is very well organized

00:00:51.004 --> 00:00:53.563
and has run very smoothly

00:00:53.841 --> 00:00:59.079
and can also deduce that the creation of this universe,

00:00:59.337 --> 00:01:00.916
this particular universe

00:01:01.135 --> 00:01:04.864
has led to the creation of this Mother Earth.

00:01:10.242 --> 00:01:16.193
Five million years back, about, this Mother Earth

00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:25.082
in gaseous form seceded and was cooled down.

00:01:25.107 --> 00:01:31.602
How was it cooled down, no-one knows.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:39.300
But if it was cooled down, why is it not that cool as the Sun is?

00:01:39.538 --> 00:01:43.191
Because in the science, nobody thinks as to ‘How?’

00:01:43.744 --> 00:01:48.292
They just accept as it is.  They are not supposed to know,

00:01:48.511 --> 00:01:52.178
or they cannot find out because they have limitations.

00:01:52.356 --> 00:01:56.661
Why this thing happened? How it was done?

00:01:58.204 --> 00:02:01.298
It is easy to say there is no God

00:02:01.518 --> 00:02:06.894
but very difficult to explain many things
without saying that there is God,

00:02:07.113 --> 00:02:11.279
For example, the time that was taken

00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:18.814
for this universe to create a human being is so very short,

00:02:19.092 --> 00:02:22.623
is so very short that nothing can explain it.

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:29.126
If you use the law of chance

00:02:30.702 --> 00:02:35.257
– perhaps some of the mathematicians,
if they are here, they may know

00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:43.161
– by which we can find out how many times

00:02:44.211 --> 00:02:48.012
the permutations and combinations have to work

00:02:48.866 --> 00:02:51.980
to create even a living cell.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:02.803
For example, in a test tube if you have 50 red pills

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.195
and 50 white pills,

00:03:07.411 --> 00:03:12.211
all arranged in such a manner
that all the red ones are at the bottom

00:03:13.145 --> 00:03:20.426
and the white ones are on the top, you have to go on shaking them,

00:03:21.578 --> 00:03:26.671
and when you go on shaking them, they are all disorganized.

00:03:27.644 --> 00:03:35.292
Then to organize it fully how many times one has to shake?

00:03:36.384 --> 00:03:42.693
They have discovered a formula,
that is N raised to power something, something.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:55.036
According to this formula, if human beings are created by chance,

00:03:56.247 --> 00:04:03.588
it seems an impossibility; because the time
that is taken so far is so short

00:04:03.767 --> 00:04:09.492
that only, at the most, may be,
some living cell could have been created.

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:14.959
Why a complicated human being has been created

00:04:15.177 --> 00:04:18.711
and so beautifully it is organized within ourselves,

00:04:18.887 --> 00:04:25.335
that it is hard to believe that some juggler
was not behind the show.

00:04:26.824 --> 00:04:31.491
There must have been some scientist
who has achieved these results.

00:04:31.694 --> 00:04:38.795
It could not have  been possible by some special hand

00:04:43.201 --> 00:04:49.758
to do these things; I mean if there was no organization,

00:04:49.936 --> 00:04:53.559
no thinking behind it, no planning behind it,

00:04:53.838 --> 00:04:58.559
and  no powerful personality behind it,

00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:03.242
The Almighty,  it could not have been possible.

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:09.082
As science has its limitations, of course, we cannot find out

00:05:10.328 --> 00:05:15.660
how it was expedited, how it took place?

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:24.251
But we can see that we have achieved
something in the field of science,

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:32.715
by one method – perhaps that is
the method that was used to trigger this also that fast.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.321
When I was young, as you are, when I was studying Myself

00:05:39.535 --> 00:05:42.242
at that time, I could never have believed

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:46.857
that we could ever reach the moon; nobody could have believed.

00:05:47.036 --> 00:05:50.903
If anyone would have said that, people would have laughed

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:52.988
at such a conjecture.

00:05:54.456 --> 00:05:57.920
Even today if you tell My grandmother, she does not believe it.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.393
She thinks it is just a story you are telling her.

00:06:00.551 --> 00:06:03.151
But we have reached the moon, no doubt.

00:06:03.982 --> 00:06:14.542
In this system, we have used a very wonderful system

00:06:15.356 --> 00:06:20.991
of putting five capsules one into another

00:06:23.213 --> 00:06:28.617
and the one capsule, the lowest capsule, explodes

00:06:29.316 --> 00:06:33.093
and triggers the movement of the rest of the four .

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.311
Then the second one explodes, and gives an acceleration

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.847
many more times than it was already moving;

00:06:45.811 --> 00:06:50.424
the speed increases in such a tremendous way

00:06:52.190 --> 00:07:01.535
that suddenly we find

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:07.527
the acceleration is so multiple of the first one

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.129
that the second one, when it explodes,
it gives another push to the capsule.

00:07:13.848 --> 00:07:17.550
Then the third one explodes at a point.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:24.555
Then the fourth one, and the fifth one is the
one that contains the spacecraft.

00:07:25.526 --> 00:07:29.188
This kind of explosion from one to another,

00:07:29.507 --> 00:07:31.707
through that built-in mechanism,

00:07:31.918 --> 00:07:35.668
we have been able to achieve
this tremendous speed and acceleration.

00:07:36.104 --> 00:07:39.238
In the same way our evolution has taken place.

00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:43.922
We have got this idea, without even knowing about our evolution,

00:07:44.113 --> 00:07:48.380
from the unconscious. We have come to know how it has happened,

00:07:51.301 --> 00:07:55.006
but we cannot correlate both things together.

00:07:57.275 --> 00:08:02.037
So, in the same way a human being was created out of amoebae

00:08:02.275 --> 00:08:08.219
or amoebae was created out of all the elements in the same manner.

00:08:09.259 --> 00:08:14.127
We can say that we were made again of five capsules.

00:08:14.405 --> 00:08:19.325
The first one is the physical, our physical being.

00:08:19.623 --> 00:08:26.567
Inside the physical being was kept our mental being.

00:08:26.826 --> 00:08:30.426
Inside the mental being was kept the emotional being.

00:08:30.596 --> 00:08:34.769
Inside the emotional being was kept the spiritual being

00:08:34.988 --> 00:08:38.777
and inside the spiritual being was kept the spirit,

00:08:41.826 --> 00:08:44.286
or our attention, you can say.

00:08:46.767 --> 00:08:50.144
Kundalini is the one which triggers,

00:08:51.553 --> 00:08:54.608
that is the one that explodes.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:00.107
So Kundalini is in everything: the Kundalini force in everything.

00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:06.712
But, the best it is, highest it is,
the most effective it is, is in the human beings.

00:09:09.371 --> 00:09:15.178
Because force to evolve

00:09:19.345 --> 00:09:24.999
from, say from carbon to amoebae [state/stage]
and amoebae to animal [state/stage]

00:09:25.199 --> 00:09:30.186
and animal stage to human stage, exists in everyone.

00:09:31.198 --> 00:09:37.306
Even in the elements it exists because elements also evolve.

00:09:37.466 --> 00:09:41.532
We do not know how they evolve but it happens in the Nature,

00:09:41.929 --> 00:09:46.293
that elements start changing their forms and [UNCLEAR]

00:09:46.532 --> 00:09:50.368
and they become different elements.

00:09:51.066 --> 00:09:54.811
The mass changes but we have no idea

00:09:54.956 --> 00:10:00.710
because we have no way of measuring the [quantity/quantum?]
of this change that is taking place.

00:10:00.889 --> 00:10:06.861
Then the animals also change.  Animals change, from… Many fishes,

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:15.033
they become reptiles. Out of reptiles many become mammals.

00:10:15.668 --> 00:10:18.763
From mammals, many become human beings;

00:10:19.577 --> 00:10:23.910
or you can say that monkeys or quadrupeds and then human beings.

00:10:24.317 --> 00:10:28.117
All this happening takes place.  How many are destroyed,

00:10:28.268 --> 00:10:31.401
and how many become, how many are transformed,

00:10:31.552 --> 00:10:35.619
nobody has measured it and nobody has kept any account of it.

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:42.409
Today, we talk of a population problem.

00:10:43.619 --> 00:10:48.887
Perhaps many animals have taken birth.
You can see the effect of that,

00:10:49.052 --> 00:10:53.291
the way people are behaving; you can be sure that many animals

00:10:53.475 --> 00:10:56.621
must have taken life and they have yet to go

00:10:56.741 --> 00:10:59.292
–lot of evolution and training as a human being

00:10:59.431 --> 00:11:02.031
to understand the value of human life.

00:11:03.598 --> 00:11:08.875
But once a human being starts evolving within himself.

00:11:10.542 --> 00:11:13.476
Now we have been human beings, as they say,

00:11:13.658 --> 00:11:18.275
for 14,000 years – I think it is even more than that.

00:11:18.848 --> 00:11:22.314
So we have been human beings say, for 14,000 years.

00:11:22.638 --> 00:11:27.776
We have been inside growing through our freedom,

00:11:28.054 --> 00:11:32.335
Human beings are the only people who get freedom

00:11:34.379 --> 00:11:37.883
to evolve themselves, to understand

00:11:38.439 --> 00:11:42.109
what is wrong and what is bad.

00:11:45.264 --> 00:11:51.511
This freedom is granted because
without freedom you cannot go any further.

00:11:51.769 --> 00:11:57.140
For example, when you are studying in the schools,
you are told 2 plus 2 is 4.

00:11:57.478 --> 00:12:01.013
Then you are given tables and you are told that

00:12:01.273 --> 00:12:05.394
2 times tables are like this
– you remember by heart and it is like this.

00:12:05.572 --> 00:12:11.750
We do not question that 2 by 10, why is it? 2 into 10 why is it 20?

00:12:11.987 --> 00:12:15.163
We do not question, we just go on and on and on.

00:12:15.322 --> 00:12:18.529
But when you reach a certain standard of education,

00:12:18.668 --> 00:12:22.405
say a graduation or a post graduation standard,

00:12:22.624 --> 00:12:25.649
then you are given freedom to write thesis on this subject

00:12:25.789 --> 00:12:31.542
– why is it that when you multiply 2 by 10 it is 20?

00:12:31.939 --> 00:12:35.739
Because you have reached a certain stage of development.

00:12:35.888 --> 00:12:40.021
At this stage you are given freedom to find out for yourself.

00:12:42.237 --> 00:12:49.724
That is how you are developed and then by this development only

00:12:49.923 --> 00:12:53.256
you can teach the other people who are coming up.

00:12:53.673 --> 00:12:56.273
This is the way the evolution has been.

00:12:58.713 --> 00:13:01.446
So far you have not felt your evolution:

00:13:02.029 --> 00:13:05.095
from amoebae to this stage you have not felt.

00:13:05.754 --> 00:13:08.820
You do not know how you became a human being,

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:13.197
you just take it for granted.  Even if you see your eyes,

00:13:13.388 --> 00:13:15.054
they are so complicated.

00:13:15.609 --> 00:13:19.809
It is such a complicated organ that if you start studying them

00:13:19.935 --> 00:13:22.477
you will be amazed how things are made.

00:13:22.577 --> 00:13:27.643
If you just prick a pin in my finger,
immediately there is a reflex action.

00:13:27.854 --> 00:13:36.309
It is so nicely built, it is so nicely arranged;
it is so quick, it is so efficient,

00:13:36.764 --> 00:13:40.326
that one is surprised and amazed

00:13:40.606 --> 00:13:45.272
at the wonders of this kind of organization,
that is this human body.

00:13:45.705 --> 00:13:50.371
But you see what human beings are,
they are inefficiency personified.

00:13:50.804 --> 00:13:54.537
I sent four telegrams to my daughter and today she says

00:13:54.772 --> 00:13:57.906
that she received one telegram after one month.

00:14:01.456 --> 00:14:05.213
Human beings have been given freedom to understand

00:14:05.412 --> 00:14:10.808
and to develop their own efficiency,
to receive the ultimate knowledge

00:14:11.852 --> 00:14:18.776
of the Creator of this creation, the powers of this Creator.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:26.745
And that is why a Kundalini is placed in the human beings alone.

00:14:27.043 --> 00:14:34.543
Though there is Kundalini force and there is
Kundalini in another form in everything else that exists,

00:14:34.762 --> 00:14:38.362
only in the human being, when they get their freedom,

00:14:40.068 --> 00:14:52.052
this force is kept in the triangular bone,
dormant, to trigger the last jumping into the unknown.

00:14:56.785 --> 00:15:00.614
Now this is there, this Kundalini exists.

00:15:02.055 --> 00:15:10.847
But to begin with, if I say, before starting all this creation,

00:15:13.466 --> 00:15:18.525
who was created first, is most interesting and may not be

00:15:19.181 --> 00:15:22.047
very congenial to the mind of a scientist.

00:15:23.141 --> 00:15:26.074
It is much beyond science I am talking now,

00:15:26.276 --> 00:15:34.589
that much before anything was created on this Earth,

00:15:35.263 --> 00:15:37.048
Holiness was created

00:15:39.907 --> 00:15:41.774
– what we call the Parviti.

00:15:43.193 --> 00:15:47.597
Shri Ganesha is the deity of that Holiness.

00:15:48.034 --> 00:15:52.855
God has created this Holiness to protect His creation.

00:15:54.026 --> 00:15:57.986
This atmosphere of Holiness He created to protect

00:15:59.316 --> 00:16:04.533
all the people, all the creative things which have been there,

00:16:05.089 --> 00:16:08.879
which have been created by Him, otherwise

00:16:09.546 --> 00:16:11.212
nothing would work out.

00:16:12.026 --> 00:16:20.875
Just think if one of the Oceans was deeper even by 10 feet,

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:24.917
the balance of Earth would have toppled down;

00:16:25.262 --> 00:16:32.690
just imagine what a speed this Mother Earth has,

00:16:33.211 --> 00:16:37.794
it revolves with such a tremendous speed, goes round the Sun

00:16:37.953 --> 00:16:44.242
regularly in a proper way, not in a round way,

00:16:44.441 --> 00:16:46.841
but in a special style as you know.

00:16:50.408 --> 00:16:56.091
She creates day and night for you: night to rest and day to work.

00:16:56.845 --> 00:17:01.626
How She Herself has created this beautiful atmosphere for you

00:17:02.143 --> 00:17:07.209
and has maintained the balance
and the temperature that was given to Her,

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:13.670
is only done by the power of Holiness that was created around.

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:18.841
Now, man in his foolishness is challenging that Holiness.

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:26.279
He thinks he can challenge God.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.513
That’s the sign of his [dwarfness?].

00:17:31.313 --> 00:17:38.825
If he had risen that high where
he could feel God pulsating in everything,

00:17:38.983 --> 00:17:41.086
he would never have done that.

00:17:41.246 --> 00:17:44.712
But before he could reach that state of perfection,

00:17:45.174 --> 00:17:47.508
he has started talking about God.

00:17:48.746 --> 00:17:53.559
Who is going to challenge his authority of this stupid man,

00:17:54.016 --> 00:17:58.837
who doesn’t want to achieve his perfection and wants to talk big?

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:12.639
All pervading power is there of Holiness which corrects,

00:18:15.021 --> 00:18:21.588
which guides, which co-ordinates, which loves

00:18:22.858 --> 00:18:28.773
and which organizes everything for you to get

00:18:30.499 --> 00:18:33.227
this awakening within you.

00:18:34.552 --> 00:18:42.907
So one must understand how Kundalini awakening
is the most important thing that has to happen.

00:18:43.317 --> 00:18:50.169
Kundalini awakening is the only way
you are going to know your spirit, your Atma.

00:18:50.423 --> 00:18:57.063
This is the most important happening in the history of creation.

00:18:57.864 --> 00:19:01.931
It’s like the garden you spread out; you lay out the garden,

00:19:02.414 --> 00:19:08.289
you put down everything, you plant the trees,

00:19:08.544 --> 00:19:13.877
the trees have the flowers and now the time has come,
the fruits must appear.

00:19:14.735 --> 00:19:19.268
It’s the most important thing and has to happen to every individual

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:22.996
who is seeking the Truth.

00:19:23.895 --> 00:19:27.957
The trouble with truth is, that that also you have to see

00:19:28.212 --> 00:19:30.906
with humility in your own freedom.

00:19:31.258 --> 00:19:34.392
Nobody can hypnotize people for seeking truth;

00:19:35.282 --> 00:19:39.090
those who are hypnotized cannot understand.

00:19:39.597 --> 00:19:42.668
In all your awareness, in all your freedom,

00:19:42.925 --> 00:19:46.125
in all your understanding, in all your dignity,

00:19:46.297 --> 00:19:48.897
you have to get the knowledge of truth.

00:19:49.246 --> 00:19:53.288
But it is not just giving you a lecture that
you are going to understand.

00:19:53.446 --> 00:19:57.973
It is not brainwashing – that has been
done by all nonsensical people throughout.

00:19:58.383 --> 00:20:03.850
It is the happening, the actualization
by which you reach that state of awareness

00:20:04.067 --> 00:20:14.145
by which you develop the dynamics of collective consciousness.

00:20:16.039 --> 00:20:18.461
Collective consciousness.

00:20:19.457 --> 00:20:23.089
By which you become collectively conscious:

00:20:25.395 --> 00:20:30.277
is an awareness which develops within you

00:20:31.528 --> 00:20:34.456
– is real actualization.

00:20:36.313 --> 00:20:39.046
As you are a human being, you know that,

00:20:39.848 --> 00:20:44.125
when this capsule of human being was triggered,

00:20:44.614 --> 00:20:47.738
you got lots of things as your awareness,

00:20:47.954 --> 00:20:52.426
more than that of animals. ‘The University itself;

00:20:53.579 --> 00:20:56.045
animals don’t have any universities.

00:20:57.973 --> 00:21:00.240
Animals don’t understand gardens,

00:21:00.805 --> 00:21:05.405
they don’t understand dirt and filth, they don’t understand beauty.

00:21:06.372 --> 00:21:09.750
All this has come to you, built within you,

00:21:10.161 --> 00:21:13.227
manifested as soon as you became human beings.

00:21:16.103 --> 00:21:20.805
So, as soon as you become the super human being,

00:21:21.391 --> 00:21:29.707
you become aware of yourself within
and you become aware of others within.

00:21:30.781 --> 00:21:33.941
This is the collective consciousness,

00:21:34.117 --> 00:21:36.773
this is what Sahaja Yoga is.

00:21:38.101 --> 00:21:41.167
Sahaja Yoga is the system of nature.

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:47.554
Is the system; the way this creation took place is also Sahaj:

00:21:47.945 --> 00:21:52.343
Built in – Sahaja. ‘Sah’ means with, ‘ja’ means born.

00:21:52.635 --> 00:21:55.969
Everything is within you like a seed if you see.

00:21:56.132 --> 00:22:00.370
Seed has a primule within it to sprout.

00:22:01.522 --> 00:22:08.256
Seed has the complete [ path?] of the tree
that it is going to be and the trees it is going to be.

00:22:08.612 --> 00:22:13.012
The whole thing is in the seed, in the same way in the human seed

00:22:13.195 --> 00:22:17.129
the whole picture of what he is going to be is built in.

00:22:17.596 --> 00:22:20.330
The whole mechanism is placed within him.

00:22:20.721 --> 00:22:25.404
Now there are the undercurrents of your being,

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:29.834
which I’ve been describing this evening to you.

00:22:29.991 --> 00:22:33.291
What are the forces that have built up human beings,

00:22:33.409 --> 00:22:36.514
which are inside him. Only thing I would like to say

00:22:36.632 --> 00:22:38.965
that you are like a computer made;

00:22:39.092 --> 00:22:41.142
you are already made like a computer,

00:22:41.241 --> 00:22:44.131
only thing is you are to be put to the mains.

00:22:44.307 --> 00:22:48.604
If you are put to the mains then
the computer starts working by itself,

00:22:48.839 --> 00:22:53.572
but it is not the way you understand a machine.
You are a human being,

00:22:54.268 --> 00:22:56.068
and you know what is love.

00:22:56.377 --> 00:22:58.977
To a scientist I cannot talk of love.

00:22:59.151 --> 00:23:02.432
I am talking of Divine Holiness,

00:23:02.569 --> 00:23:05.169
the love of God which has created you,

00:23:05.312 --> 00:23:07.245
which wants you to know Him.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:13.877
Through science you cannot love.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:18.408
Every scientist must be loving somebody

00:23:18.604 --> 00:23:21.404
– if not his children at least, his dog.

00:23:21.749 --> 00:23:24.834
He must be loving flowers: if not flowers,

00:23:24.991 --> 00:23:27.058
he might be loving his horses,

00:23:27.257 --> 00:23:29.057
but he knows what is love.

00:23:29.273 --> 00:23:32.041
And if he can understand that spark of love,

00:23:32.178 --> 00:23:34.111
from where it has come,

00:23:35.675 --> 00:23:41.041
love that I am talking about is a synthesis of all these powers.

00:23:41.413 --> 00:23:45.920
Science deals with only a very little [of it?].

00:23:47.151 --> 00:23:56.076
I will also tell you which part of this power deals

00:23:56.819 --> 00:24:05.686
with our physical being and out of
which how much a scientist knows.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:10.041
You will be surprised – if knowledge is an Ocean,

00:24:10.428 --> 00:24:13.494
the scientist knows only a drop.

00:24:15.468 --> 00:24:23.612
And to know the Ocean, the drop is to be dissolved in the Ocean.

00:24:24.256 --> 00:24:29.059
But the drop cannot by his effort, become the Ocean

00:24:29.389 --> 00:24:34.522
– the Ocean has to dissolve the drop.
And that is what Ocean has to do it,

00:24:34.796 --> 00:24:44.596
if His creation has to have its fulfilment
and His beautiful creation is

00:24:46.822 --> 00:24:50.729
manifested in the human being.

00:24:51.393 --> 00:24:55.104
The human being must find out his fulfilment.

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.833
If he cannot find out his fulfilment,

00:24:59.294 --> 00:25:05.505
he cannot reach any perfection in any one of his endeavours

00:25:06.013 --> 00:25:10.872
and God Himself will not rest till he does that.

00:25:11.243 --> 00:25:14.777
Because who would like to destroy one’s own creation

00:25:15.618 --> 00:25:22.161
of thousands and thousands of years of a pre-planned thing.

00:25:23.509 --> 00:25:26.809
This has to come to its fulfilment

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.012
and if it is to be done by Me,

00:25:30.285 --> 00:25:34.249
if I am the person who is supposed to trigger your Kundalini,

00:25:34.427 --> 00:25:36.827
why should you have any objection?

00:25:39.681 --> 00:25:42.001
Thank God, I was not a scientist;

00:25:42.157 --> 00:25:46.224
otherwise I would have finished my life making an atom bomb.

00:25:47.763 --> 00:25:54.030
Thank God, I am not a psychologist;
otherwise I would have gone mad, listening to mad people.

00:25:54.755 --> 00:25:59.423
Thank God, I am not a politician, you know how they are.

00:26:01.415 --> 00:26:05.015
Thank God, I am none of these, I am just your Mother;

00:26:08.173 --> 00:26:12.762
concerned, absolutely concerned,

00:26:13.231 --> 00:26:18.739
about your ultimate well being and not superficial things.

00:26:21.044 --> 00:26:26.844
We’ll have the meditation now
– that’s more important than any one of these lectures.

00:26:27.025 --> 00:26:30.425
I’ve already given 84 tapes to these London people

00:26:30.814 --> 00:26:34.583
– I’ve been speaking and speaking, every day two to three lectures.

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.520
Best thing is to have it.

00:26:37.689 --> 00:26:42.022
Now some of you who do not get it should not get upset with Me.

00:26:42.715 --> 00:26:46.049
If you do not get it, there is nothing to worry.

00:26:46.212 --> 00:26:51.954
If you get it, well and good.  If you don’t get it,
you’ll get it this evening, if not tomorrow.

00:26:52.423 --> 00:26:56.329
It is a very subtle happening: should happen to you.

00:26:57.325 --> 00:27:03.009
If it happens, immediately you’ll find the relaxation will come.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.490
But the best thing that happens to you

00:27:05.688 --> 00:27:09.907
is first of all is your physical being is absolutely [different?]

00:27:10.102 --> 00:27:14.236
Now this lady now has come here with a very serious disease.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:23.087
If she had come to Me earlier
– [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi to someone]…

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:28.086
So if this lady had come to Me at the end,
she would never have [UNCLEAR].

00:27:28.575 --> 00:27:33.320
If she had come to Me and got her realization,

00:27:33.497 --> 00:27:38.763
she would have been alright today.
But she said she did not know about it.

00:27:39.805 --> 00:27:43.339
What’s the use of getting ill and then coming to Me,

00:27:43.555 --> 00:27:46.969
asking for My blessing and all sorts of things

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:50.620
instead of getting your realization or

00:27:50.885 --> 00:27:54.645
in keeping your very good health to begin with?

00:27:54.801 --> 00:27:57.068
It comes to you as a by product.

00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:59.780
That comes to you as a by product.

00:28:00.348 --> 00:28:02.660
It is not done through Me.  Because,

00:28:02.914 --> 00:28:06.839
say now, how you have decorated when I’m coming in here

00:28:07.062 --> 00:28:10.062
– in the same way, if the light has to come,

00:28:10.785 --> 00:28:15.433
the Divine has to shine, your own body is cleansed.

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:19.281
Is beautified and is made healthy;

00:28:19.672 --> 00:28:23.405
that’s as a by product.   But that’s not the ultimate.

00:28:24.887 --> 00:28:30.220
The light has to come within you,
the reality has to be pulsating within you;

00:28:30.765 --> 00:28:36.156
unless and until that happens, everything else has no meaning.

00:28:37.952 --> 00:28:41.752
The other things that can happen is if you are mentally…

00:28:41.937 --> 00:28:47.388
Also upset – or as I have said,
the physical, the mental, the emotional,

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:53.326
then the spiritual – and then beyond that is the state

00:28:53.561 --> 00:28:58.185
of complete bliss, of collective consciousness is established:

00:28:58.381 --> 00:29:00.381
In the space you are thrown.

00:29:00.562 --> 00:29:03.229
In the same way, it happens within you,

00:29:03.562 --> 00:29:09.533
so naturally all these things are
[UNCLEAR –exploded?] and normalised

00:29:10.647 --> 00:29:13.780
and the ultimate is established in the space.

00:29:14.279 --> 00:29:19.848
Whatever is useless or sick falls off.

00:29:20.122 --> 00:29:22.322
Whatever is beautiful comes up.

00:29:22.812 --> 00:29:27.348
As in the tree, you have seen that when the fruit comes up,

00:29:27.544 --> 00:29:29.544
so many things have to drop.

00:29:29.673 --> 00:29:34.458
In the same way, all that is not wanted drops out

00:29:34.654 --> 00:29:39.731
and all that is required shows itself and manifests.

00:29:40.062 --> 00:29:43.636
It’s a very beautiful happening – it should happen to all of you

00:29:43.814 --> 00:29:47.739
– but again I would like to tell you,
it is a very subtle happening.

00:29:47.857 --> 00:29:49.457
It was never this way.

00:29:50.103 --> 00:29:54.236
Only for the first time that it has started working this way;

00:29:54.439 --> 00:30:02.743
that it is given to people who are [Sanskrit?]

00:30:03.055 --> 00:30:07.645
– who are simple people, ordinary people, leading a very

00:30:07.811 --> 00:30:12.762
simple life.  Because it has to happen that way because,

00:30:13.271 --> 00:30:19.384
supposing there is a discovery of electricity

00:30:20.165 --> 00:30:24.243
by one person, which has a big history behind it.

00:30:24.439 --> 00:30:30.039
And he discovers something, and
he does not make it useful for the common people.

00:30:30.572 --> 00:30:33.438
If the common people cannot benefit by it,

00:30:33.774 --> 00:30:37.837
if the ordinary people cannot understand it, it has no meaning.

00:30:38.032 --> 00:30:43.012
In the same way, Sahaja Yoga has to go to common people;

00:30:43.247 --> 00:30:48.993
everybody must understand.  Otherwise,
people like Christ were crucified – nobody understood Him.

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:51.836
People like Kabira, nobody understood.

00:30:52.138 --> 00:30:54.405
People like Nanaka was tortured.

00:30:55.107 --> 00:30:58.174
People like Mohammed-Sahib was given poisons,

00:30:58.545 --> 00:31:04.611
and every one of them had to just suffer
because of the ignorance of the common people.

00:31:05.062 --> 00:31:08.929
Today, the time has come for common people to be realised.

00:31:12.415 --> 00:31:17.411
Let’s try how many of you get it.
If you get it, then it’s a subtle thing,

00:31:17.562 --> 00:31:22.684
but to settle into Sahaja Yoga, you have to practise.

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:27.469
You have to come at least once a month – at least minimum –

00:31:27.646 --> 00:31:31.579
to a general program, because it is a collective program.

00:31:31.708 --> 00:31:37.801
It’s a common program, and that’s
why it is going to work out in Collective;

00:31:38.211 --> 00:31:41.011
individually it’s not going to work out.

00:31:41.161 --> 00:31:43.495
Individually it’s very difficult.

00:31:43.642 --> 00:31:47.977
As you know about Hatha yogis

00:31:48.312 --> 00:31:50.751
– how they have to stay in the jungle.

00:31:50.907 --> 00:31:55.594
Before they were twenty five years of age,
Hatha Yoga was to work out with [UNCLEAR Ashtang?]

00:31:55.712 --> 00:31:59.438
Not the way the modern hatha yoga is all wrong:
Absolutely wrong.  It should not be

00:31:59.594 --> 00:32:00.981
– it’s the wrong style.

00:32:01.118 --> 00:32:07.309
Because this kind of Hatha yoga takes your attention only to
your physical being and gives you an imbalance.

00:32:07.427 --> 00:32:11.938
The other day I had somebody who was a great Hatha yogi
and he had a heart attack.

00:32:12.153 --> 00:32:14.981
So he told Me he got a heart attack after Hatha yoga.

00:32:15.204 --> 00:32:16.972
So I said then what did he do?  So he said,

00:32:17.168 --> 00:32:20.718
‘They gave me another yoga to remove this heart attack.’

00:32:20.875 --> 00:32:24.410
And when he came here for Me, he was shaking, just like this.

00:32:24.528 --> 00:32:26.652
So I told him, ask for the man who is shaking,

00:32:26.792 --> 00:32:30.592
and this man was a possessed man from a lunatic asylum.

00:32:30.676 --> 00:32:32.707
I said, ‘This is what has happened to your nerves.

00:32:32.824 --> 00:32:35.890
Who are asking to break your neck for nothing at all?

00:32:36.028 --> 00:32:38.605
There was no need for you to go to such an extreme.

00:32:38.753 --> 00:32:41.769
You should have just waited; you would have got your realisation.’

00:32:41.887 --> 00:32:44.328
Of course, [UNCLEAR Asanas?] also have a place,

00:32:44.446 --> 00:32:47.101
but you must understand the complete shastra:

00:32:47.238 --> 00:32:52.958
Complete science of all these things must be understood.

00:32:53.115 --> 00:32:56.630
But that is after realisation, not before.

00:32:57.548 --> 00:33:00.258
For example, you are suffering from stomach trouble

00:33:00.376 --> 00:33:02.661
and if you start using an asana for your neck,

00:33:02.772 --> 00:33:06.274
you’ve had it: your neck will be gone
and then your stomach will be [next?].

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:08.650
So there is a big science behind

00:33:08.814 --> 00:33:12.368
and those who understand the science will not use it for such a

00:33:12.486 --> 00:33:16.352
long time, every day, religiously – there is no need to.

00:33:16.958 --> 00:33:20.473
Whenever there is some need, then only take the medicine.

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:24.458
Do you go on staying in a medicine shop all your life,

00:33:24.634 --> 00:33:26.034
just to keep healthy?

00:33:27.231 --> 00:33:29.164
Same thing is about Mantra.

00:33:29.312 --> 00:33:32.485
Mantra also has got a very big science;

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:35.454
once you understand that science that is [UNCLEAR].

00:33:35.611 --> 00:33:38.944
Without realisation, mantra also has no meaning.

00:33:39.165 --> 00:33:43.032
Those who give you mantras are people who are [UNCLEAR]

00:33:43.207 --> 00:33:46.292
They don’t understand any meaning of mantra, I can tell you.

00:33:46.431 --> 00:33:52.719
Because I have seen, the way they are knowing the chakras
and things, and the Kundalini doesn’t rise.

00:33:52.954 --> 00:33:56.354
The basic thing is that your Kundalini must rise.

00:33:56.568 --> 00:34:01.034
Those people who spoil your Kundalini, I do not like them at all.

00:34:01.579 --> 00:34:04.446
Some of them spoil because they are naïve;

00:34:04.665 --> 00:34:09.932
they don’t know what to do about Kundalini
because they are not authorised.

00:34:10.193 --> 00:34:13.356
They are not holy people, they are not realised souls.

00:34:13.493 --> 00:34:16.384
They are not supposed to do it, so they spoil your Kundalini.

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:20.700
They make money out of it,
because anybody can sell anything, you see.

00:34:20.857 --> 00:34:23.668
Anybody can say, ‘I am a Kundalini awakener.’

00:34:23.786 --> 00:34:26.120
What can you do about the [fuss?]

00:34:26.384 --> 00:34:29.176
God is not going to come and arrest you for that.

00:34:29.313 --> 00:34:33.356
You are arrested, in a way, but that’s a very subtle [UNCLEAR]

00:34:33.474 --> 00:34:38.874
which nobody understands.
That these are the punishments of our wrongdoing.

00:34:39.529 --> 00:34:44.762
Those who try to do it in a naïve way can be forgiven.

00:34:44.958 --> 00:34:50.153
Even those who make money, I can forgive them,
because this is a silly thing that’s going on everywhere.

00:34:50.312 --> 00:34:54.245
But those who do it deliberately are definitely the devils

00:34:54.431 --> 00:34:56.764
– I call them Danavas, Rakshasas.

00:34:57.144 --> 00:35:00.367
Because deliberately to spoil somebody’s Kundalini,

00:35:00.525 --> 00:35:07.204
just to entice them, and to hypnotise them to use for
your own purpose, is absolutely Satanic:

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:11.699
is against the purpose of God and that’s
why I’ll call them as the Devil.

00:35:11.875 --> 00:35:17.742
So, let us have the experience
– you put your hands towards Me and… [tape fades out]
