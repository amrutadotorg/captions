Archive video: H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi at Conference 1985 0701 in International Press Center, Brussels (Belgium).

00:50.000 --> 00:57.892
1985-0701 Press Conference Brussels Belgium DP-RAW

00:58.000 --> 01:02.892
Shri Mataji: How do we start, am I suppose to say something about Kundalini?

01:03.000 --> 01:07.892
Yogi: Yes Shri Mataji we would like to know   Shri Mataji Hmm Yogi: By your voice something about

01:08.000 --> 01:18.892
Shri Mataji: You have told them already? I can I think they can ask me questions if you have already told them they know of the subject

01:19.000 --> 01:31.892
Journalists discussing something among themselves Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon Journalist: says something Shri Mataji: Me?

01:32.000 --> 01:40.892
Journalist: They would like to hear from you Shri Mataji

01:41.000 --> 01:50.892
Shri Mataji: I see, I don�t know how what he has told you,

01:51.000 --> 02:06.892
but I have come here to tell you about something that may be good for all our problems in the west.

02:07.000 --> 02:22.892
The western mind has grown just like a tree has grown outside, without going into the roots,

02:23.000 --> 02:42.892
so the outgrown tree has to know about the roots, and thus we are waiting for a shock.

02:43.000 --> 02:52.892
Recently I have been to America and I feel that the danger to America is not from outside but from inside.

03:10.000 --> 03:20.892
They have been indulging into things without knowing what relationship it has to the whole,

03:31.000 --> 03:47.892
so the need of today is to know why we have these maladies. Where are we going?

04:01.000 --> 04:11.892
I have been searching within human beings the problem in a different way, inside them,

04:12.000 --> 04:25.892
I did my medicine and just to talk to `doctors and through meditative methods penetrating,

04:26.000 --> 04:40.892
I tried to find out why human beings are diverted from real reality.

04:41.000 --> 04:52.892
There are two categories of human beings actually, only two.

04:53.000 --> 05:02.892
One category who has human awareness, human awareness,

05:03.000 --> 05:20.892
and the other category is a special category I call it, who can be called as people who are realised souls,

05:21.000 --> 05:31.892
(they all understand English that�s good).

05:32.000 --> 05:38.892
This is a special category which is mentioned in all the religions, by all the prophets,

05:39.000 --> 05:57.892
everyone has talked about this date, Tao, Zen, Buddha, Mahavira, Christ of course, everyone has talked about it.

06:06.000 --> 06:16.892
What is gone wrong with religions is that, that they have not tried to find out their spirit,

06:17.000 --> 06:21.892
the essence of it, they lost the point?

06:32.000 --> 06:42.892
Now supposing if there is something called as spiritual awareness or a super awareness,

06:43.000 --> 06:48.892
supposing, take a hypothesis, you have to keep your mind open as scientists.

06:55.000 --> 07:02.892
If what I am saying if I can prove it to you, then you accept it but don�t keep your mind closed.

07:12.000 --> 07:23.892
Even scientists are very much conditioned by science.

07:24.000 --> 07:31.892
Science is a mental projection, it�s just a mental projection and whatever is in the nature that is what they discover,

07:32.000 --> 07:39.892
they cannot create even a stone, we cannot create even a stone.

07:40.000 --> 07:50.892
They must accept, we can analyse, we can find out whatever is in nature

07:51.000 --> 08:00.892
but it is just a mental projection which is limited and which is linear.

08:01.000 --> 08:07.892
Because of its linear movement it recoils back upon us, it cannot sustain itself,

08:08.000 --> 08:12.892
so science has produced atom bomb and we are frightened of it,

08:13.000 --> 08:18.892
now computer will produce another problem, one after another we�ll have problems after problems

08:19.000 --> 08:26.892
machines have produced problems, we have acid drinks, the development,

08:27.000 --> 08:36.892
the whole economic development ends up into a problem, plastic has produced problems for us.

08:46.000 --> 08:57.892
Because we, it is not related to reality

08:58.000 --> 09:11.892
Even when Confucius talked of humanism it was needed at that time when people were lethargic,

09:12.000 --> 09:19.892
but the way people have developed themselves now, without any relationship to reality

09:20.000 --> 09:27.892
or to the whole we have become malignant in a way in for trouble

09:28.000 --> 09:35.892
and the trouble is we are not aware till it blasts off.

09:36.000 --> 09:41.892
Without the transformation of human beings from within not only talking about it,

09:42.000 --> 09:47.892
what we need is a transformation in our awareness,

09:48.000 --> 09:56.892
so we have to see with an open mind if it is feasible if it exists with an open mind.

09:57.000 --> 10:08.892
I think all thinking people should try to see if there is a possibility or not,

10:09.000 --> 10:17.892
if so then we think positively about it, if so, how do we achieve it.

10:27.000 --> 10:33.892
It�s a natural process within us built in, a living process

10:34.000 --> 10:38.892
by which we have become human beings from amoeba stage,

10:39.000 --> 10:45.892
and the second stage whatever if it is so, again I keep it as a hypothesis,

10:46.000 --> 10:56.892
has to happen has to happen naturally, has to happen spontaneously.

11:02.000 --> 11:15.892
But in the human stage, it is little different from the animal stage, a fish came out of the sea, one fish,

11:16.000 --> 11:22.892
then ten followed, then hundreds and then a shoal of fishes followed.

11:23.000 --> 11:29.892
But human beings not easy, because they have the freedom to decide,

11:30.000 --> 11:37.892
they have freedom and their freedom is to be respected if they have to have ultimate freedom.

11:48.000 --> 11:56.892
And very difficult for human beings to accept that anybody can tell them about it, very difficult,

11:57.000 --> 12:07.892
that�s why they crucified Christ, poisoned Mohammed Saheb, tortured Buddha, Mahavira, they cannot accept.

12:23.000 --> 12:37.892
When I was born, I tried to really understand human beings, and this big problem that they have,

12:38.000 --> 12:48.892
so I thought no use talking about, the best thing is those who are born on the ground

12:49.000 --> 12:55.892
are to be elevated at least on the second or third story so they know there is something beyond.

12:56.000 --> 13:04.000
That�s the best way one can manage.

13:04.000 --> 13:13.892
But the problem was that here is what you see is the seventh centre, within us the subtle centre was not opened.

13:14.000 --> 13:20.892
It was to be opened. Where you get your baptism to actualise not artificial baptism,

13:21.000 --> 13:27.892
it�s a real a baptism (beg your pardon),

13:28.000 --> 13:43.892
so when that happened I could manage the awakening of this dormant energy within us

13:44.000 --> 13:48.892
which is actually, whatever I am saying you should not take it for granted,

13:49.000 --> 13:54.892
I am again saying with the open mind, it�s the knowledge of the roots.

13:55.000 --> 14:05.892
Is the this is the power which expresses the reflection of the Holy Ghost within us.

14:06.000 --> 14:19.892
Christ was given hardly three and a half years to talk, it�s no time for Christ to tell all these things,

14:20.000 --> 14:29.892
and they crucified him. For four years I was struggling with seven British hippies

14:30.000 --> 14:36.892
couldn�t do anything with them, because first of all, they do not have the tradition of our seeking,

14:37.000 --> 14:42.892
they have no tradition, they have a desire but no tradition, they don�t understand what to seek,

14:43.000 --> 14:52.892
what to achieve, there is no tradition at all, because the tradition is to grow outside not inside inward.

15:05.000 --> 15:11.892
And this is like a plumule in a seed, which is to be awakened, it awakens

15:12.000 --> 15:19.892
and pierces through your fontanelle bone area and you can feel the cool breeze coming out of your head you do feel.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.892
It�s an experience, it may happen it may not happen you cannot be guaranteed.

15:25.000 --> 15:30.892
but it happened to so many in Europe, I should say so many in America.

15:31.000 --> 15:36.892
In India, it is in thousands, thousands because they have the tradition.

15:46.000 --> 15:52.892
And it will work very fast in India, I know that very easy to work it out there,

15:53.000 --> 15:58.892
people are not that materialistic, I mean here when I come in the west people say there is poverty,

15:59.000 --> 16:03.892
we don�t think we are poor I don�t know what makes people think we are poor, which way,

16:04.000 --> 16:08.892
we are much more generous than any other country people are, very generous people,

16:09.000 --> 16:16.892
you go to an ordinary Indian, he would love to look after you, we are very happy joyous festive people,

16:17.000 --> 16:26.892
here I find everybody so miserable, le miserable. They are satisfied people.

16:27.000 --> 16:34.892
What is in matter, do you think you can get joy out of this matter alright a little bit we need for comfort,

16:35.000 --> 16:38.892
we can sit on the ground in India, we don�t have such bad weather,

16:39.000 --> 16:43.892
that all the time you have to cover yourself, we can live under a tree

16:44.000 --> 16:55.892
and there is no poverty of the heart. Others are more concerned about our poverty

16:56.000 --> 17:01.892
and also they do not want to think why we are poor because we were aggressed for three hundred years,

17:02.000 --> 17:10.892
at least for three hundred years, you can imagine,

17:11.000 --> 17:19.892
and also left all the funny things of materialism like you will be amazed that

17:20.000 --> 17:24.892
in my father�s house I had never known locking the houses or theft or bribery we never knew,

17:25.000 --> 17:36.892
all this was left behind by the British. So, we are still suffering the pangs you see of that slavery,

17:37.000 --> 17:47.892
but the Indians as they live in the villages, these are the unknown Indians, they are very different.

17:56.000 --> 18:04.892
Because materialism without relationship to the spirit can be very dangerous, we see that we see that.

18:11.000 --> 18:17.892
Now you know there are diseases coming up in America and when I went there,

18:18.000 --> 18:25.892
they said to me we have right to destroy ourselves what do you say to that, then I said alright you go ahead with it.

18:31.000 --> 18:39.892
The positive attitude towards life if it is lost through materialism is better not to have it.

18:40.000 --> 18:45.892
The attitude should be positive, constructive.

18:46.000 --> 18:55.892
There�s no love there�s no compassion there�s no heart in the life, people are so frustrated, disgusted, unhappy.

19:11.000 --> 19:16.892
Actually, I never had in my mind to come to the west but my husband got elected to this job by

19:17.000 --> 19:22.892
134 nations elected him and I was forced to come to London.

19:23.000 --> 19:34.892
That�s how I am here and I see it and I feel it that there are great saints born in this country great people,

19:35.000 --> 19:41.892
great seekers you see those people who are taking now drugs and all that are seekers you must know they are seekers,

19:42.000 --> 19:50.892
very beautiful people they are in heart, very nice people, they are to be saved. It has to be done.

19:57.000 --> 20:02.892
In sahaja yoga when it happens you�ll be surprised overnight people have given up drugs, overnight,

20:03.000 --> 20:11.892
overnight, people have been cured of incurable diseases like cancer so many diseases,

20:12.000 --> 20:18.892
but AIDS, we have cured AIDS, you�ll be surprised but,

20:19.000 --> 20:27.892
it is not that we should say that I have cured but this energy which is residual within you when

20:28.000 --> 20:34.892
it awakens it nourishes you, by that nourishment you just get cured physically.

20:39.000 --> 20:47.892
Mentally you get peaceful and it is not just talk it is actualization it�s becoming

20:48.000 --> 20:52.892
that is what every human being can become, a little breakthrough is needed,

20:53.000 --> 20:58.892
that�s how every human being can become that.

20:59.000 --> 21:05.892
Now see our political systems are fighting for nothing at all, it�s all mental I think,

21:06.000 --> 21:14.892
like we say somebody is a capitalist, a communist and this and that it is it�s not reality

21:15.000 --> 21:19.892
I would say that I am the greatest capitalist I feel because I know everything about it, I have

21:20.000 --> 21:24.892
all the powers I am the greatest communist because I must share it,

21:25.000 --> 21:32.892
everything integrates once you become the spirit, everything, all these theories which have failed,

21:33.000 --> 21:41.892
which we think look like just the words become reality when you become the spirit.

21:42.000 --> 21:47.892
But one must turn one�s attention to it, it�s very difficult to break

21:48.000 --> 21:56.892
because all our attention is involved into all useless things which are fruitless, joyless pursuits.

21:57.000 --> 22:06.892
It is very difficult to turn I mean especially with journalism I find in the west is brought up in a very different manner.

22:07.000 --> 22:11.892
I mean if Brussels journalist could do some justice to me I�ll be thankful

22:12.000 --> 22:19.892
but I must say that countries of tradition like Italy have come along

22:20.000 --> 22:24.892
because they are traditional they understand serenity, they understand auspiciousness,

22:25.000 --> 22:31.892
they understand also holiness, sacredness, still surprisingly.

22:38.000 --> 22:48.892
And I am sure one day everybody will pay some attention and you can�t pay for it,

22:49.000 --> 22:54.892
you see how have gurus here this kind of a thing that kind of thing where people make money,

22:55.000 --> 22:59.892
lynch others, is cannot do these things cannot do these things this is so spontaneous it�s your own

23:00.000 --> 23:07.892
this is what you have to get.

23:08.000 --> 23:14.892
And for that you cannot be obliged to anyone it is just your own like one light which is enlightened

23:15.000 --> 23:25.892
if it enlightens another candle it doesn�t oblige it is just ready gets it, it�s no obligation nothing.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.892
And Mohammed Saheb has specially said about it I must say I don�t know what the Muslims are doing

23:31.000 --> 23:35.892
I mean they are all one better than the other all this fundamentalist better not deal with them,

23:36.000 --> 23:41.892
but He himself has said that at the time of resurrection your hands will speak,

23:42.000 --> 23:45.892
He has spoken more about resurrection than about doom�s day,

23:46.000 --> 23:49.892
but they want to talk about doomsday because they can frighten people you see and develop their fundamentalism

23:50.000 --> 23:55.892
not only Muslims everybody is like that, and nobody has done justice to their leaders

23:56.000 --> 24:01.892
or to their prophets or to their incarnations nobody has done. They have nothing to do with them,

24:02.000 --> 24:06.892
Christ himself has said, you �ll be calling me Christ, Christ I won�t recognize,

24:07.000 --> 24:12.892
He has clearly said, you are to be born again so they certified themselves I am born again

24:13.000 --> 24:21.892
I am baptized you cannot certify like that, you have to be, to be honest one has to be.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.892
A dog cannot certify itself that I am a human being, can it?

24:25.000 --> 24:34.892
Supposing it certifies it cannot be, he has to become.

24:35.000 --> 24:40.892
Now you ask me questions because you see the thing is the subject matter is so big

24:41.000 --> 24:45.892
and I have dealt in thousands and thousands of lectures and things and

24:46.000 --> 24:50.892
so the best thing would be to ask questions about this will be a good idea.

24:51.000 --> 24:57.892
Journalist: How did you discover this?

24:58.000 --> 25:03.892
Shri Mataji: You see that I discovered because I have certain methods of doing it.

25:04.000 --> 25:10.892
They say supposing somebody is a scientist and you are not a scientist so how can the scientist tell you how did I discover,

25:11.000 --> 25:19.892
but I told you in way that I know how to do it I can know the inside of human being somehow,

25:20.000 --> 25:27.892
but I have that within me what can I do if I have? Alright?

25:33.000 --> 25:40.892
Journalist: What is the difference between what you are telling us and what all the yogis of the tradition

25:41.000 --> 25:47.892
of the world telling this scheme appears to be in all books about yoga.

25:48.000 --> 25:53.892
Shri Mataji: No the books you all have read are not traditional none of them is traditional,

25:54.000 --> 26:01.892
you see about a hundred years back this some new stuff came in, I am amazed at what I tell you

26:02.000 --> 26:07.892
and because the western mind is extrovert and extrovert mind always likes new things,

26:08.000 --> 26:11.892
anything new, you see you tell them you put a tin on your head they�ll put it,

26:12.000 --> 26:17.892
you tell them you make your hair like this they�ll make it, I mean it�s something new all the time they go to,

26:18.000 --> 26:26.892
whatever you know about the traditional yoga it�s not, if you read Patanjali its very different from what you do in yoga.

26:27.000 --> 26:34.892
He never talked of all these asanas you do to that extent, actually it was it is very recent I would not even say hundred years.

26:35.000 --> 26:41.892
One fellow went to the Himalayas and was discarded by all the realized souls there.

26:42.000 --> 26:49.892
He came down and he started writing about these asanas actually, it is all related to your chakras,

26:50.000 --> 26:59.892
we too use asanas but how, when the kundalini rises we know on what centre it stops,

27:00.000 --> 27:05.892
then we know how to correct that centre, supposing it is a physical problem then you have to do a particular asana,

27:06.000 --> 27:10.892
but supposing you have a problem in the stomach and you do the asana for some other chakra what�s the use?

27:11.000 --> 27:16.892
It�s a science, if you read Patanjali the whole book is like this in Sanskrit language,

27:17.000 --> 27:25.892
it�s not translated in English the whole of it not at all and this one was a long time back,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.892
fourteen thousand years back they mentioned kundalini,

27:29.000 --> 27:33.892
sixteen thousand I would say Markandya was sixteen thousand years back he mentioned kundalini,

27:34.000 --> 27:40.892
kundalini is the basis but about a hundred years back people started talking about all kind of nonsense.

27:41.000 --> 27:45.892
Even in India, westernized Indians are impressed by all these kind of things. I went to Puna,

27:46.000 --> 27:49.892
I was surprised people were having paralysis this that.

27:50.000 --> 27:55.892
I said that how is it you have got all these problems, people said ah our guru has taught us all this.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.892
What is your guru? What did he tell you?

27:58.000 --> 28:02.892
They gave me names like Shaktipaya, Taruopaya, Darunopaya, this that, I said

28:03.000 --> 28:06.892
I never heard of where did you learn this thing. They gave me one book,

28:07.000 --> 28:11.892
which was written only seventy years back by some crazy fellow,

28:12.000 --> 28:16.892
which is not mentioned anywhere in the thing, I mean

28:17.000 --> 28:20.892
if you read even Adi Shankaracharya he has talked about it, Chaitanya lahari and all,

28:21.000 --> 28:28.892
but that�s the sixth century. Kabira, now Kabira is much later, Nanaka throughout,

28:29.000 --> 28:36.892
but how people can change it into something funny you see like the Greeks changed all the Gods

28:37.000 --> 28:43.892
into something stupid like Kabira talked of this as a surati, called it as surati,

28:44.000 --> 28:49.892
this kundalini as surati. Kabira called, but do you know when he was born in Bihar

28:50.000 --> 28:57.892
they called tobacco as surati now what do you say to that.

28:58.000 --> 29:03.892
Christ has talked about it, even Bible, I will appear before you like tongues of flames

29:04.000 --> 29:09.892
He has said about the tree of fire, this is the same thing.

29:10.000 --> 29:17.892
But according to time people have talked this was a secret knowledge for quite some time in India,

29:18.000 --> 29:26.892
but it became quite an eloquent I think at the time of Adi Shankaracharya to begin with

29:27.000 --> 29:30.892
but Kabira and Nanaka have already said it clearly. What about the Sikhs?

29:31.000 --> 29:36.892
Do they know anything about it? It�s all they read from one page to another in two and a half hours the whole thing they can read.

29:37.000 --> 29:42.892
But they miss all the points, you see reading is not the way to know it. It has to happen.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.892
Like supposing you have a headache and I say you take Anacin

29:47.000 --> 29:51.892
and you go on reading I take Anacin I take Anacin will it, it will work out?

29:52.000 --> 29:56.892
So the knowledge that you have got about yoga books is only about hundred years old

29:57.000 --> 30:02.892
which I don�t know from where it has come, when I read it I am amazed and I have read ,

30:03.000 --> 30:06.892
seen such a thick book written on kundalini that the kundalini is in the stomach ,

30:07.000 --> 30:12.892
it is not you can see at the times sometimes in some people when the centre of nabhi

30:13.000 --> 30:17.892
or the centre of the solar plexus is under pressure

30:18.000 --> 30:23.892
you can see even the pulsation of the kundalini very clearly on this triangular bone, very clearly,

30:24.000 --> 30:28.892
but I would say even the Greeks knew about it because they called this bone as sacrum,

30:29.000 --> 30:32.892
sacrum meaning sacred, they knew about it

30:33.000 --> 30:41.892
definitely otherwise why did they call this bone sacrum.

30:42.000 --> 30:49.892
Athena itself the Ath, Ath means primordial and Athena is the one stands with a snake-like

30:50.000 --> 30:53.892
thing in her hand and with all the centres showing in her hand,

30:54.000 --> 30:57.892
if you see the I have seen the I have been to Greece I know,

30:58.000 --> 31:04.892
but all that was sort of brought down to some sort of a level which I don�t know understand

31:05.000 --> 31:15.892
what should I call it we call it supra-conscious level, it is something on the right-hand side movement.

31:16.000 --> 31:21.892
Or the left side movement as we call it as the subconscious or the collective subconscious

31:22.000 --> 31:27.892
because they could not move higher they started giving supra-conscious aa experiences

31:28.000 --> 31:32.892
and the collective subconscious experiences which are very dangerous very dangerous

31:33.000 --> 31:40.892
like parapsychology now, how to convince them it is a collective subconscious entry

31:41.000 --> 31:50.892
which is very dangerous. That cancer is triggered by that, how to tell them?

31:51.000 --> 31:58.892
By entering into the collective sub-conscious, you will be amazed that people are such closed about things

31:59.000 --> 32:03.892
There were four great scientists came to India to talk to me from America

32:04.000 --> 32:10.892
and they wanted to become I don�t know what, they said we want to have that consciousness by which

32:11.000 --> 32:14.892
you become subtle you can go to moon you can go to the sun.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.892
I said why you are already flying in the air why do you want to become that.

32:19.000 --> 32:25.892
They said no we want to become subtle personalities to go into the air if I do this. I said but why?

32:26.000 --> 32:32.892
They said because Russians are doing it. I said they are doing wrong they�ll all suffer and you will also suffer.

32:33.000 --> 32:38.892
I said who told you this, they gave a name of a journalist in India called Patanjali.

32:39.000 --> 32:45.892
I said I am amazed at Patanjali himself because he was suffering from this kind of a disease,

32:46.000 --> 32:51.892
and his wife came to me and I cured him now do you want me to put the disease into you.

32:52.000 --> 32:59.892
It�s very dangerous to play about with the subconscious and the collective subconscious

33:00.000 --> 33:02.892
or supra-conscious or the collective supra-conscious.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.892
You are lost you do not know what you are doing.

33:06.000 --> 33:09.892
That�s what some of these false and fake gurus and all these people

33:10.000 --> 33:17.892
who are very powerful here are using that mesmerism, ESP all this is the same.

33:18.000 --> 33:28.892
Thank God now we have published a book in French which you can see yourself and read.

33:30.000 --> 33:37.892
Yes Journalist: Difference between what you are doing and certain other eastern religions in the west is that you don�t ask money

33:38.000 --> 33:43.892
Shri Mataji: No no no how can you pay money? How can you pay money for? Now say

33:44.000 --> 33:46.892
I am saying it�s a living process let be wise about it,

33:47.000 --> 33:52.892
now If it�s the mother earth she is sprouting a seed, do we pay anything to the mother earth?

33:53.000 --> 33:59.892
Do we? And be wise about it how can you pay for it? It is invaluable,

34:00.000 --> 34:04.892
how much did we pay to become human beings from the monkey stage? Did we pay?

34:05.000 --> 34:08.892
Let�s take it that way, I mean I am asking you a simple question.

34:09.000 --> 34:15.892
It�s a living process how can you pay for it?

34:16.000 --> 34:23.892
I, at the most you can pay for my ticket to the aero for the aeroplane, at the most I mean

34:24.000 --> 34:27.892
if you have to pay anything that you can pay?

34:29.000 --> 34:32.892
Journalist: You are too rich Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon Journalist: You are too rich

34:33.000 --> 34:40.892
Shri Mataji: Luckily this time I am born in a rich family. I come from a royal family in India

34:41.000 --> 34:47.892
which has a calendar and also my husband is quite well off and a generous man and he believes,

34:48.000 --> 34:51.892
he believes that that�s the only way it can work out, he believes in Sahaja yoga,

34:52.000 --> 35:02.892
he is a great sustenance for me. I live alright and you will also live alright.

35:03.000 --> 35:08.892
For this, you don�t have to pay.

35:09.000 --> 35:15.892
Krishna has said �Yog kashem vahameyam� when you get yoga real union, He looks after you

35:16.000 --> 35:20.892
and wellbeing everything physical, mental, emotional, even material.

35:21.000 --> 39:57.892
Because you become such a satisfied soul also, now as you see me,

35:36.000 --> 35:40.892
a mini palace sort of a place may be, well I can live anywhere, I can live on the street

35:41.000 --> 35:45.892
I can live in the jungles, this body of mine is very good it doesn�t trouble me at all

35:46.000 --> 35:56.892
it�s comfortable anywhere. I am not bothered about what I eat, what I do, not bothered.

35:57.000 --> 36:04.892
Comfort is another slavery, I mean those who sit on the chair cannot sit on the ground,

36:05.000 --> 36:12.892
the chair comes on our head, the more we try to be comfortable the worst it is.

36:13.000 --> 36:18.892
But the body can be your slave I mean it�s just it is for you, you are not for the body.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.892
Journalist: But certain others like Bhagwan they do ask money

36:28.000 --> 36:32.892
Shri Mataji: Babba don�t bring these controversial people it is how can it be?

36:33.000 --> 36:39.892
Just tell me how can it be? They ask, let them ask, what to do, they will go with its all wrong,

36:40.000 --> 36:47.892
you are people so naive, why do you give them? You are so naive,

36:48.000 --> 36:58.892
like one fellow came to London and he said if you give me the 59th Rolls Royce then I�ll come, can you imagine,

36:59.000 --> 37:03.892
ninth Rolls Royce, so the poor boy so sweet of them but stupid also,

37:04.000 --> 37:10.892
starved themselves for one year, bought a Rolls Royce for him when this great man came in

37:11.000 --> 37:21.892
and the big journalist of London and everybody was there to take photographs of the Rolls Royce.

37:22.000 --> 37:27.892
And when some of the Sahaja yogis approached them they said why you want to give him a Rolls Royce

37:28.000 --> 37:31.892
they said Rolls Royce is a metal we are giving him the metal he gives us the spirit.

37:32.000 --> 37:37.892
How can you convert metal into the spirit? Can you?

37:38.000 --> 37:46.892
You are intelligent people you have to tell them that it�s not possible to convert metal into

37:47.000 --> 37:55.892
that�s why they are very angry with me all of them, you see after all you see are all very against me but what to do?

38:00.000 --> 38:03.892
Yes, please Journalist: People do feel themselves

38:04.000 --> 38:13.892
and realize themselves what are the means that like what are the exercises like in the traditional yoga

38:14.000 --> 38:17.892
Shri Mataji: No, No you see there is no exercise it is effortless,

38:18.000 --> 38:25.892
Sahaj, sah means with, sah means with, ja means born, is born with you, no nothing has to be done.

38:26.000 --> 38:36.892
The realization goes into first the step of awakening when the kundalini herself comes up alright.

38:37.000 --> 38:45.892
Now the advantage of this is like a lamp which is dirty, or something wrong with the lamp,

38:46.000 --> 38:52.892
if you put a little light in it, it can see for itself, what�s wrong with me alright?

38:53.000 --> 38:58.892
So, you start cleansing yourself, like you become your own guru you become your own master.

38:59.000 --> 39:03.892
But first little light must come, that�s important, that�s the only job I do

39:04.000 --> 39:12.892
the rest of it you look after. You have to become your own guru.

39:19.000 --> 39:28.892
It�s not only I, supposing you get it and you master it, then you, you can do it,

39:29.000 --> 39:35.892
we �ve one gentleman in India, he is just a farmer, has given realization to ten thousand people.

39:36.000 --> 39:42.892
Well here is Dr Warren I don�t know how many people he has given realization I don�t keep count of it

39:43.000 --> 39:48.892
because we have no organisation as such, we have no membership nothing of that kind.

39:49.000 --> 39:55.892
We don�t have any organisation as such we have another Doctor here sitting.

39:58.000 --> 40:03.000
I come from a rich family so called my husband is rich my house in London could be called as

40:03.000 --> 40:07.892
Journalist: You have centres different? Shri Mataji: Yes centres we have,

40:08.000 --> 40:14.892
but it�s not like the centres that others have, its actually like people when they are living in a place you see,

40:15.000 --> 40:19.892
they pay the rent of the place, they manage I don�t know how they live they share among themselves,

40:20.000 --> 40:28.892
the rent as well as the food and that they call as the centre.

40:29.000 --> 40:34.892
They become so collective and you should see the joy that flows between them,

40:35.000 --> 40:38.892
a person going from here to India and in India the people waiting for him to come a Sahaja yogi

40:39.000 --> 40:42.892
is coming to the whole world becomes your family.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.892
Journalist: Why don�t you call it an ashram? Shri Mataji: Hmm? Beg your pardon

40:47.000 --> 40:52.892
Journalist: Why don�t you call it an ashram?                Why don't you call it an ashram? These centres.

40:53.000 --> 40:59.892
Shri Mataji: We do, do call ashram, ashram also we call it, we call it ashram also we call it ashram,

41:00.000 --> 41:04.892
also centres. If it�s a small place where only people can come to visit,

41:05.000 --> 41:10.892
then it is a centre see whatever you may call that makes no difference.

41:11.000 --> 41:19.892
We have ashrams everywhere except here we don�t have but hope to establish one here, we have just a centre.

41:27.000 --> 41:36.892
We have an ashram in Italy where else, we have an ashram in Austria very good ashram,

41:37.000 --> 41:42.892
we have a very good one in Switzerland. In England, we have five of them.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.892
France, we have a very nice ashram.

42:06.000 --> 42:16.892
It�s not just a lip service it�s an actualization, lip service, just talking about, it�s not just the theory,

42:17.000 --> 42:22.892
it�s just the actualization, because you are that I mean it�s nothing difficult, you are all that,

42:23.000 --> 42:30.892
just you have to have what you have, that�s all, you have to be aware of it that�s all.

42:31.000 --> 42:35.892
It�s so simple that�s why people don�t like it You see if we tell them you can eat like this

42:36.000 --> 42:40.892
no they don�t want to they want to eat this way that way that way (laughs),

42:41.000 --> 42:47.892
what can we do about its very simple has to be because it is so vital like our breathing,

42:48.000 --> 42:52.892
supposing for our breathing you have to read a yoga and go to a guru pay him thousand pounds,

42:53.000 --> 43:01.892
how many will exist, it is so vital, and the time has come, this is the time,

43:02.000 --> 43:07.892
the time, it�s all mentioned thousands of years back, if you heard about Bhrigumani,

43:08.000 --> 43:11.892
he has written a complete book called as Nadi Granth,

43:12.000 --> 43:14.892
about these times everything described Sahaja yoga everything,

43:15.000 --> 43:23.892
even 100 years back I would say William Blake has described everything about Sahaja yoga everything,

43:24.000 --> 43:29.892
but people called him crazy, they like people like Barron all imaginary people.

43:41.000 --> 43:49.892
Journalist: William Blake was a poet and poetical mystic, are you mystic as well?

43:50.000 --> 43:53.892
Shri Mataji: I don�t know what to call myself it�s very difficult (Laughs)

43:54.000 --> 43:56.892
Journalist: You know what mysticism is? Shri Mataji: I know aha

43:57.000 --> 44:05.892
you can call me everything I think, it�s quite an integration of so many things I have,

44:06.000 --> 44:10.892
but I would like to call myself as the Mother that�s the sweetest and the best I think

44:11.000 --> 44:18.892
because I am very patient, perhaps am extremely forgiving.

44:24.000 --> 44:29.892
Journalist: And how does a Mother bring the light to Her children?

44:30.000 --> 44:47.892
Shri Mataji: It�s a re-birth, re-birth and the birth is given by the Mother only, Father can�t give the birth.

44:48.000 --> 44:53.892
It�s an immaculate re-birth.

44:54.000 --> 44:59.892
Journalist: Once this re-birth has taken place, you�ll have two minds two ways of living

45:00.000 --> 45:02.892
so no alcohol no drinks, how to move

45:03.000 --> 45:05.892
Shri Mataji: No I don�t tell anything like that before that, but you just give up yourself

45:06.000 --> 45:12.892
I don�t say anything, you just give up yourself, whatever is not good for you, you just give up

45:13.000 --> 45:18.892
because you become joy, start feeling the cool breeze of the `Holy Ghost this gives you vibrations

45:19.000 --> 45:22.892
and you don�t want to do anything like that, now for example if you ask me to take to drugs

45:23.000 --> 45:28.892
I will not I mean I am never tempted for alcohol or any I am never tempted to anything

45:29.000 --> 45:33.892
I am just don�t get tempted or anything you just don�t do it yourself because if you are the spirit

45:34.000 --> 45:38.892
you are so detached. If you become the spirit you become the glory of the spirit,

45:39.000 --> 45:43.892
you have the powers of the spirit, you become such a great personality yourself.

45:44.000 --> 45:52.892
You just don�t do it, I don�t have to tell you, I don�t force anything whatsoever.

45:53.000 --> 46:00.892
You become yourselves that�s only when you become yourself you are great no doubt about it.

46:01.000 --> 46:07.892
It�s a very revolutionary time, \{year\}very revolutionary you should see

46:08.000 --> 46:13.892
the signs of revolution we never had so many seekers we never had so many confusions

46:14.000 --> 46:26.892
so many problems and in that confusion only, the lotus of your spirit is going to shine.

46:27.000 --> 46:35.892
We say in Sanskrit that only in the mud and mire of confusion the lotus is born.

46:51.000 --> 46:55.892
It cannot be a money making proposition I mean that you must have understood now,

46:56.000 --> 47:01.892
cannot be and it has to be effortless, and you get empowered by it you see

47:02.000 --> 47:06.892
if you say I am twice-born alright you certify, but what is your power?

47:07.000 --> 47:12.892
If you are twice-born what do you know? You actually become, become, again I say become is very important

47:13.000 --> 47:18.892
that on your central nervous system you can feel another person,

47:19.000 --> 47:22.892
on your fingertips you can feel the centres of another person and your own,

47:23.000 --> 47:26.892
now only thing what you have to know and get it corrected, that�s all

47:27.000 --> 47:32.892
if you know the method it is finished, hardly you take a month at the most to know about.

47:34.000 --> 47:37.892
Journalist: Can you explain to people, for instance, tonight in Brussels?

47:38.000 --> 47:42.892
Shri Mataji: Yes I, I decode things now for example now supposing this centre is catching

47:43.000 --> 47:47.892
this centre is catching supposing you are feeling the burning on these centres then what does it mean,

47:48.000 --> 47:53.892
I am just decoding it, and then they verify it and is a fact it works out.

47:54.000 --> 47:57.892
We are the real computer I tell you only we are to be put to the mains.

47:58.000 --> 48:02.892
We are the masters of all the computers, we have created computers,

48:03.000 --> 48:09.892
but we become the divine computers and there is divine all-pervading power

48:10.000 --> 48:16.892
which does all living work like these flowers, flowers becoming fruits, we cannot do even one,

48:17.000 --> 48:21.892
and when that starts flowing through us must only know how to manoeuvre it.

48:22.000 --> 48:31.892
We are to be put to the mains, that�s the point is, and this kundalini acts like a chord.

48:32.000 --> 48:36.892
It is there in all of us.

48:37.000 --> 48:44.892
First, it was just people told about it, talked about it, and one or two flowers on the tree of life I should say.

48:45.000 --> 48:50.892
It was a secret also, but now blossom time, so many flowers have to become fruits,

48:51.000 --> 48:56.892
real blossom time, I tell you, beautiful people, we have in this world.

48:57.000 --> 49:07.892
They are unknown but they are beautiful people. Sinister people are very few actually,

49:08.000 --> 49:11.892
those who have made our lives miserable,

49:12.000 --> 49:17.892
but we can outwit them once we get aware of ourselves we can outwit all of them.

49:18.000 --> 49:26.892
Nobody can touch us, and there is divine power and such blessings you can�t believe it

49:27.000 --> 49:30.892
the miracles of Sahaja Yoga you cannot believe it.

49:31.000 --> 49:38.892
Today only when I came in the morning one of the Sahaja Yogi�s was standing very close to the car

49:39.000 --> 49:45.892
and the whole of Mercedes went over his foot and nothing happened to his foot, nothing,

49:46.000 --> 49:57.892
he didn�t even get the pain, we saw it, it is, God is very great He�s the He�s the real charismatic personality you can�t think of.

49:58.000 --> 50:03.892
You can�t imagine how great he is we just have to know Him,

50:04.000 --> 50:08.892
but when you talk of God in these modern times people don�t want to hear from you.

50:09.000 --> 50:13.892
It�s not fanaticism it�s not all that non-sense its actualization.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.892
Journalist: Did you meet the Pope anytime? Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon

50:28.000 --> 50:31.892
Journalist: Did you meet the Pope anytime? Or did you think of meeting him?

50:32.000 --> 50:41.892
Shri Mataji: Oh, (laugh) They are just the same, actually I met Pope much earlier,

50:42.000 --> 50:46.892
that you need not write I am just telling you, when I went to Poland,

50:47.000 --> 50:55.892
I went on 1st of September to Poland about just before he became the Pope,

50:56.000 --> 51:04.892
I don�t remember the year and because my husband is a VIP and all that is they asked me

51:05.000 --> 51:09.892
where would you like to go so I said I would like to see a good church and an organ

51:10.000 --> 51:13.892
so they took me to Cracow while my husband went for his own work,

51:14.000 --> 51:20.892
and there it was this gentle man was a cardinal, I raised his Kundalini alright

51:21.000 --> 51:27.892
but I didn�t tell him because I mean he won�t take it from me anything, it does,

51:28.000 --> 51:33.892
it did pierce no doubt it did pierce, it comes up sometimes but then again it goes down,

51:34.000 --> 51:41.892
I am sorry but that�s what it is, so to become a Pope is very easy, very easy,

51:42.000 --> 51:47.892
I mean to become a Pope what is so great I mean you can be elected human made its a manmade stuff,

51:48.000 --> 51:57.892
for God made, you have to little bit work it out, that�s what has happened in his case I wish,

51:58.000 --> 52:04.892
sometimes he does gives vibrations, again it stops again he has to work it out.

52:05.000 --> 52:10.892
I went to Cracow but it was so it was so, it was so historical I should say

52:11.000 --> 52:14.892
because it was the first of September and I was very sad, and my husband said why are you so sad

52:15.000 --> 52:18.892
I said this country must be very sad on this day sometime,

52:19.000 --> 52:23.892
and then we discovered it was the day first day when it was bombed, Warsaw was bombed

52:24.000 --> 52:32.892
and eighth of September is the day they celebrate the Black Mary�s a birthday,

52:33.000 --> 52:39.892
and they take out the image of Black Mary, before that I met and then I saw that all that,

52:40.000 --> 52:46.892
it�s very historical I should say, but who can talk to him, I mean they wrote a letter to him

52:47.000 --> 52:51.892
whether he�s protected and you see you can�t talk to him like that cannot.

52:52.000 --> 53:02.892
All that kind of a thing I don�t need. I mean Christ never had that kind of a protocol this that,

53:03.000 --> 53:11.892
I mean something different world they live in, I mean you just what can I do, will they listen to me?

53:12.000 --> 53:18.892
Will they recognize Christ? If Christ comes here will he recognize Christ? How will he recognize?

53:19.000 --> 53:27.892
Pope even, how will he recognize? Can he? Is there any measure?

53:28.000 --> 53:32.892
I don�t want to criticize anyone that�s one thing I would like to say no controversies, please.

53:33.000 --> 53:36.892
This is what it is when you ask me the question, I have to say this,

53:37.000 --> 53:43.892
everybody is capable of becoming the self but must know that by becoming something like a king

53:44.000 --> 53:50.892
or a Pope or a Guru, you are not there you have to become.

53:57.000 --> 54:04.892
These are all the appointments by human beings not by God.

54:05.000 --> 54:10.892
All these are appointments by God, here you have Pope, in India we have Shankracharayas

54:11.000 --> 54:16.892
aaa in Zen system also we have, I met the head of Zen I was amazed,

54:17.000 --> 54:23.892
his kundalini was frozen there, I didn�t know what to say to him, so I said Sir are you are you, not a Kashyap?

54:24.000 --> 54:29.892
He said no, we never had them for the last aaa six centuries. I said you never had it,

54:30.000 --> 54:33.892
they call it a Kashyap never had a Kashyap for six centuries so what are you doing Zen.

54:34.000 --> 54:42.892
Zen you cannot do without realization, everybody is doing all these things without realization,

54:43.000 --> 54:45.892
imagine we are telephoning without connection,

54:46.000 --> 54:52.892
it�s like that very difficult you know because you are so conditioned by them.

54:53.000 --> 54:58.892
In India also the same thing, we are so conditioned by the so-called Hindu religion.

54:59.000 --> 55:03.892
Everybody is conditioned and everybody�s religion is in danger,

55:04.000 --> 55:14.892
I don�t understand how can religion be in danger, it cannot be destroyed,

55:15.000 --> 55:19.892
only thing is according to the time when they came, on the different times

55:20.000 --> 55:23.892
they were like flowers on the same tree, living tree same,

55:24.000 --> 55:27.892
but they are different times and according to the times they preached.

55:28.000 --> 55:31.892
Whatever was the problem at that time they had to face it, you see,

55:32.000 --> 55:40.892
today is the problem of evolution. Whatever they said people took out this flowers, this is mine,

55:41.000 --> 55:47.892
this is mine, these are all dead flowers we are fighting with it, you can�t blame anyone,

55:48.000 --> 55:53.892
maybe some are very gross we can say like Shiites we can call them gross,

55:54.000 --> 55:58.892
I was born in a Protestant religion and I thought they are the most sophisticated (laughs) fanatics

55:59.000 --> 56:06.892
they were known very sophisticated, extremely sophisticated are the Protestants,

56:07.000 --> 56:14.892
you cannot catch them. They will have a red cross everything all humanitarian,

56:15.000 --> 56:21.892
that�s not God�s job, that�s not God�s job, Missionaries job is not God�s, its human job,

56:22.000 --> 56:24.892
you have created problems you have poverty alright you look after it,

56:25.000 --> 56:32.892
God�s job you see is silent it doesn�t talk. Like say, I am sitting before you alright,

56:33.000 --> 56:38.892
I don�t do anything am I doing anything? I am just talking to you don�t know what I am doing to you,

56:39.000 --> 56:44.892
it just flows just acts it works. We have seen in the life of Christ somebody touched

56:45.000 --> 56:51.892
the cloth of Christ and the energy flow, he didn�t have any Missionaries did he?

56:52.000 --> 56:56.892
And imagine the missionaries came to India with the gun in the one hand

56:57.000 --> 57:00.892
and the Bible in the another and do you know who Christ was,

57:01.000 --> 57:07.892
it�s all described in the books our books as Mahavishnu it is described very well clearly who He is.

57:08.000 --> 57:12.892
But Indians could not relate Him to that because with the gun they never said, they said

57:13.000 --> 57:18.892
he is with very saumya is the one who is very mild and these people came with the gun

57:19.000 --> 57:25.892
and Bible they could not place Him there, I don�t blame that way Indians because you see

57:26.000 --> 57:33.892
you can�t expect Christ to come with the gun, not only gun

57:34.000 --> 57:37.892
but some Portuguese took cannons to blast the temples,

57:38.000 --> 57:47.892
they have blasted our temples with cannons can you believe it? Must be crazy people.

57:48.000 --> 57:51.892
Thank God one thing good has happened, Columbus did not go to India,

57:52.000 --> 57:56.892
if he had gone all of us would have been finished by now like the Red Indians were

57:57.000 --> 58:03.892
I tell you thank God. He didn�t come here.

58:04.000 --> 58:12.892
Like it if you go to Argentina you won�t find one Red Indian. I went to Chile not one Red Indian,

58:13.000 --> 58:18.892
can you imagine what these people are doing?

58:19.000 --> 58:26.892
People are not aware of what they are doing what they have done,

58:27.000 --> 58:31.892
and if you see the massacring Spain I am coming from Spain and when I knew about it the way

58:32.000 --> 58:40.892
people this inquisition they had for religion, how can you have inquisition Christ was crucified himself,

58:41.000 --> 58:48.892
what are the basis how can you do such things?

58:49.000 --> 58:54.892
If you read the history, you�ll be shocked I mean I was shocked the way they showed the inquisition there.

58:55.000 --> 59:03.892
Actually, I was not aware of it, we have to see what we have done in the name of God,

59:04.000 --> 59:10.892
in the name of compassion, in the name of love, what we have done.

59:11.000 --> 59:17.892
They are trying to save now animals, for example, chickens they are trying to save the chickens,

59:18.000 --> 59:22.892
what�s the use of saving chickens, they have to save the human being, I can�t give realization to chickens, can I?

59:29.000 --> 59:33.892
You see a political reform or anything you try to do is not going to help you,

59:34.000 --> 59:39.892
if you think democracy has worked very well I must say it�s not, I have seen Russia,

59:40.000 --> 59:50.892
I have seen China, I have seen also democracy, everything is about the same, nothing to choose.

59:51.000 --> 59:56.892
I assure you by changing the forms of government nothing is going to happen

59:57.000 --> 01:00:07.892
but the changing the forms of human being only will achieve that kingdom of God which is promised to us.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:13.892
We have to get out of it, our forefathers have done it, their forefathers have done it

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:21.892
where have we reached, nowhere, there is no peace in the world unless and until

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:29.892
we have peace within ourselves, especially, for Brussels when I came I must say about Brussels

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.892
I must say people are very hectic here, extremely hectic

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.892
because I could feel it within myself you see there�s a centre

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:45.892
which goes wobbly when the place is hectic extremely hectic speedy frustrated people,

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.892
and this centre was doing like this and for three hours I was trying to cleanse it

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.892
I mean I have I was trying to put it right just going on like this I was worried that when I face you

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:01.892
people I hope it doesn�t go into (laughs) another wobbly condition very wobbly people are very wobbly

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:09.892
we must understand. Extremely hectic, now in a person who has got blood cancer

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.892
you have this problem the centre goes off like that, the blood cancer people,

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:22.892
because the spleen which is the speedometer you see becomes crazy, and it starts wobbling,

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.892
starts producing blood cells of that kind, of course its triggered by something else

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:36.892
but the vulnerability of cancer is like that and that�s what I felt when I came I was surprised how people are like that here,

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:46.892
no peace. And we have the Europeans what is it here parliament (What is it here?) Common Market in Brussels,

01:01:47.000 --> 01:02:00.892
imagine in Brussels. We have no peace within, when I come to Brussels, I am Belgian,

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:10.892
because I can feel that, I really felt you all, it is very simple to cur correct it very simple

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:18.892
only this kundalini within you is to rise and everything will be so peaceful.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:27.892
We are so nervous, and if it is our own why not have it?

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.892
Supposing this is your property why not have it? It�s your right to have it.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.892
It�s your own property you don�t have to give anything. Like somebody asked me, Mother,

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.892
I cannot surrender, I said what have you got to surrender me when, what can you give me

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.892
I don�t need anything, what you have to surrender is your ego or your conditioning one of the two.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.892
What do you surrender there is nothing but ego.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:04.892
Only one simple thing we have to know and understand that still we are not complete

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:10.892
we have not reached our absolute state, we are living on a relative level,

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.892
we have to become the absolute, finished once you realize that much finished,

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.892
just we have to become the absolute, we have been living relatively,

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:26.892
it�s our own power we have got within ourselves why not have it, for which you cannot pay,

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:32.892
even but it is a very big problem it�s a very very big problem I must say it�s like a balloon.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.892
It floats people into the air of course conditioning is also there, in the west,

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.892
there is big conditioning especially of feeling guilty, for nothing at all they feel guilty.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.892
In the west people feel so guilty for I just don�t know why and the catch in this centre

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.892
gives trouble in the centre, this is the biggest conditioning you have is to feel guilty

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.892
for anything like you see now in England, supposing you use a fork and a spoon

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.892
in a different way they feel guilty, I mean you yourself have created these norms

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.892
like for alcohol you�ll have this kind of a glass that kind of a glass this that all nonsense

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:17.892
now if you don�t have that way you�ll feel guilty what is this?

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.892
I mean you are very simple people also to feel guilty for all the nonsensical things.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:30.892
If a lady is wearing say a sweater or a coat say with beige colour,

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:41.892
she�s carrying a white coloured purse, she feels guilty, very seriously guilty, I tell you,

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:50.892
this is so frivolous, they are like children sometimes I feel Indians will not they are shameless

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:58.892
(laughs) I must say they don�t feel guilty at all, I mean you should not feel guilty for this ,

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:04.892
Haa one can feel guilty for wars or things, but even by feeling guilty what is there

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.892
and now like English feel guilty for what English did before, why they are dead and finished,

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:15.892
now gone case you are different you are not them your forefathers are finished now forget the past.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:24.892
Now say simple thing forget the past future doesn�t exist in the present how can you be guilty,

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:34.892
simple logic (laughs), how can you be guilty in the present forget its finished.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:41.892
Like that forget and finished is your past, so how can you be guilty?

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.892
You have to be in the present, actually, we must respect ourselves.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.892
You are at the epitome of evolution we don�t respect our self, we have to love our self

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.892
and respect we are human beings we are on top of everything

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.892
we are not ego at all, but we are not also conditioning.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.892
No question because you have gone beyond though I know that

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.892
you won�t have you are feeling the cool breeze, you can feel it, just feel it just now, try to feel,

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.892
Madam, you also have the experience just one minute you just have the experience,

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.892
just put your hands like this you�ll feel it the cool breeze,

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:39.892
just to open your hands have I not, have it, why not have it? It is free, alright?

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.892
Left is there Do you smoke? No,

01:06:50.000 --> 01:07:00.892
Heart, Heart, how are you feeling? Yes, feeling, the feeling, what about you?

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.892
Are you Catholic? Yes

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:09.892
Then you feel guilty (everyone laughs) that�s one thing Catholics have done

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:15.892
I tell you Catholics are the greatest guilty people, for nothing at all, if you go to Argentina

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:23.892
you�ll be shocked they walk like this, all the time they are told they are sinners, sinners, sinners,

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:35.892
they are not, that�s the reason, she�s left Vishuddhi catching but you know it�s very dangerous,

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:44.892
you get troubles with this Spondolytis physical you also get angina to feel guilty

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:52.892
only there is one chanting for that �I am not guilty� Then it works out,

01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:01.892
that�s the reason it�s not rising above this but it will rise, are you alright? Are you feeling?

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.892
You are feeling relaxed though. Yes actually, there is no worry now.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:14.892
No there were lots of wrinkles here when I came now you go and see they are all vanished,

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.892
yes. Are you alright? Little bit. Good. A little bit, yes that�s true its very subtle

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:26.892
and we are rising from a gross attention to this subtle attention alright?

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:32.892
And we should be selfish about it why we are attached to anything?

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.892
Attached to any ideology, any theory, anything we should get it you see

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:47.892
this is what Christ has said you have to get it. Those who are sitting behind you have got it.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:57.892
They also argued a lot with me but you did not I must say not at all they did not, never argue.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:03.892
But religion cannot be organised one thing you must know it cannot be organised.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.892
Once you start organizing religion you kill the essence of religion. You cannot.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:21.892
That�s the mistake, thank God in India religion could not be organised thank God for that,

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.892
where ever they have organised religion they became fanatics, so much,

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:33.892
so much rooted into the conditioning of the religion, anywhere I mean I must say everybody is like that ,

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.892
they think no end of themselves or they get ideas sometimes that we are the best,

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.892
we know the best we got everything, that�s not true,

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.892
anywhere like Sikhs now I used to think Sikhs at least are better off, now look at them,

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.892
gone off their heads, putting bombs everywhere, why should anybody who follows any religion

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:59.892
should put bombs anywhere, just I mean is it relevant?

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:07.892
They were also organised in India, very well organised, we have another one called Arya Samaaj,

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.892
they are very ego-oriented nonsense, now the people coming out of it because when they get old

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.892
they really become senile and they talk so much

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:22.892
they just go on talking they don�t know what they are talking irrelevantly they just talk.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:35.892
You cannot be anything, you have to be human being first, when we claim I am a Belgian,

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:43.892
you are not, you could have been anything, just by chance you are born here or maybe you chose,

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.892
doesn�t matter but still you don�t become Belgian, you are a human being,

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:57.892
you laugh the same way, you smile the same way, feel the same way, only you think differently, maybe.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.892
So it is the difference and all that doesn�t exist in the mind of God

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:10.892
He doesn�t create this world like Belgium, France this that, no he did not, we have done all this.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:24.892
This is difficult because conditioning also is too much, conditioning of materialism is also here,

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:33.892
and no tradition of seeking, this is the biggest problem I feel no trade every Indian knows

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:39.892
that he has to seek his spirit and he knows what kundalini is I mean if he is not westernised,

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.892
that�s one of the conditions, if he is westernised he is just like you,

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.892
doesn�t know anything about it doesn�t want to know,

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:54.892
anyone who is not westernised knows that it�s the kundalini awakening that brings forth the realisation in India.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.892
I went to the Himalayas, Dharamshala,

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.892
people are uneducated absolutely came down over three to four thousand people, just came

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.892
and they were told Devi Jagran, the Goddess will be awakened within,

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:14.892
they know who is the Goddess is, they just came, I gave them a lecture, any problem?

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.892
No Mother awakened our Goddess I said alright done. And such tremendous vibrations,

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:23.892
they are not educated, they haven�t got all this conditioning on them simple village folk,

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.892
all of them got realisation, they knew they have got it.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:31.892
They started singing dancing enjoying themselves oh we have got it now we �ve got they know

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:39.892
despite their aaa I should their no exposure to western thinking or to education as such,

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.892
they know this they know for tradition from mother,

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.892
mother knows from her mother like that it comes to them from generations

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.892
that you have to be the spirit.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:58.892
Even Christian should know and I think they knew the whole thing got diverted,

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.892
now there is a big controversy you must know, Christianity itself is a challenge,

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:10.892
thanks to theologians, you must have a word about Mr, what �s his name Bishop of Durham

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.892
did you hear about him? No? Oh! you must that�s the latest,

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.892
Bishop of Durham says there was no immaculate conception according to Paul,

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:33.892
there was no, no this thing, this is what it is, closed mind and then criticize me.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:40.892
what�s the use of adherence to something that is ignorance now this Bishop of Durum

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:46.892
has to I mean attacked Christ immaculate conception His divinity everything he has attacked

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:54.892
and for your information, the Archbishop of Canterbury has supported him,

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:03.892
so now the whole Catholicism goes to dogs. but they cannot give up Paul also but,

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.892
to be frank why Paul is then I don�t understand, can you explain?

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:13.892
Why Paul is in the Bible, he has nothing to do with Christ.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:19.892
Not only I say that but if you have read Khalil Gibran he was a realised soul,

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:30.892
this Paul is a strange man, he�s written a complete chapter on Paul, how is he there?

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.892
Anybody who is a realised soul will say that he has nothing to do with God.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.892
He doesn�t understand God at all.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:47.892
Then came Augustine, same, same style, maybe the same incarnation, he also ruined it.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.892
Now if you want to know about Catholics go and ask the Muslims,

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.892
if you want to know about the Muslims go and ask Hindus,

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.892
This is better to know from them, they are all sailing in the same boat,

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:10.892
but criticizing either blaming each other. No use. How will they recognize Christ?

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:26.892
Is the first question one should ask. When He comes there will be no Sahaja yoga then the last,

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.892
he just sorts you out, the judgement is now, he just sorts you out.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:40.892
There will be no question and Michel Angelo has clearly shown it if you should see the Sistine Chapel very clearly.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.892
He is just standing there throwing people this side and that side that�s the Agnya Chakra where He stands,

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:57.892
just throwing out He doesn�t do anything of that kind He has no patience, that�s what it is, and that�s coming very soon.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.892
Journalist: You explain why the time has now arrived?

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:09.892
Shri Mataji: You see you are the time has to arrive according to your awareness you see.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:17.892
And the awareness today is that of that level, so it has come.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:28.892
That�s like supposing you are learning to aaa balance a cycle, now when do you balance the cycle when you balance it. (laughs).

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:35.892
It is just like that when you balance the cycle then you get it isn�t it so now you are in that situation,

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:42.892
so it is going to work out. It�s the season I would say,

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:49.892
now supposing you want to have in those days Tulips, you can�t have isn�t it,

01:16:50.000 --> 01:17:00.892
now the time the seasons, and imagine with Christ do you think so many people would sit down and listen to Him.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:09.892
No, very difficult, now we have sensible people, wiser people, nobody is going to crucify me now,

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:18.892
you think anybody can crucify me, no cannot, I mean maybe journalist may, later on (laugh).

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:25.892
Alright thank you very much, very kind of you, you have given me very patient hearing

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.892
I am sorry for the Catholic lady she didn�t like me much you see,

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:35.892
but you should not be biased if you are a journalist you have to be a witness, a detached witness,

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.892
then only you can help people, but if you are biased then you cannot work out,

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:46.892
so I have seen journalists are either biased or they want some sort of a sensation to believe,

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:52.892
now this is I am taking away from that sensationalization

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.892
I am giving you a news by which everything will be smoothed out,

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:03.892
it will be better and there will be a journalist but of a divine nature.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:10.892
We have journalism also in Sahaja yoga but then we talk of the miracles we talk of the savings,

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:15.892
we talk of the good things that have happened we have, we have our newsletters and all that,

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:30.892
but it�s a very different type, another world. We have some journalists with us also.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.892
Done now? Journalist: I thought there was no question

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:47.892
Shri Mataji: I think he has gone beyond questioning. (laughs) Alright.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.892
So thank you very much. Sahaj Yogi: Why don�t you come along tonight here. Shri Mataji: Yes Try,

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.892
Sahaja Yogi: See how it works

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.892
Shri Mataji: If you can come along that�s the best way, you see , best way,

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:04.892
there�s no challenge for it nothing no challenge, but it�s something very really to be very frank,

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.892
very new for you, not for Indians but for you its new, you must come and have a look,

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:16.892
maybe I might be making money also possibly, �laughs.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:24.892
Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you all. May God Bless you.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:50.892
This is the book. Have got some copies of that?

01:19:51.000 --> 01:20:04.892
We�ll send it, tonight at the program you can have it. Should we go now, Thank you very much.
