01:12:57.648 --> 01:13:03.098
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

01:13:09.059 --> 01:13:11.514
At the very outset,

01:13:11.542 --> 01:13:16.923
I have to tell you that Truth is what it is.

01:13:16.961 --> 01:13:19.409
You cannot change it,

01:13:19.450 --> 01:13:22.385
you cannot transform it,

01:13:22.389 --> 01:13:24.915
you cannot explain it.

01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:28.290
Only thing you can experience it.

01:13:31.245 --> 01:13:33.352
In this Kali Yuga

01:13:33.502 --> 01:13:37.643
there is a special category of people born

01:13:37.672 --> 01:13:40.673
in all the countries very surprisingly,

01:13:40.712 --> 01:13:44.438
who are seekers of Truth.

01:13:44.453 --> 01:13:51.414
And William Blake, the great poet of England

01:13:51.484 --> 01:13:53.734
has said that

01:13:55.073 --> 01:13:59.887
these men of God will be born during this time

01:13:59.938 --> 01:14:03.147
and they will know the truth

01:14:03.188 --> 01:14:05.418
So many have said about this.

01:14:05.445 --> 01:14:10.605
Even in our old books of prophecies.

01:14:13.114 --> 01:14:15.594
You have known so many of them

01:14:15.674 --> 01:14:19.442
but especially the one which is described

01:14:19.513 --> 01:14:23.007
in Nadi Granth written by Bhrigu Muni

01:14:23.088 --> 01:14:25.977
is clearly said that at this time

01:14:26.028 --> 01:14:30.882
people will know the Truth through the Kundalini Awakening.

01:14:30.903 --> 01:14:33.883
The knowledge of Kundalini was known to us,

01:14:33.933 --> 01:14:37.414
I don’t know how many years back.

01:14:37.504 --> 01:14:42.147
You cannot say because our history is so unknown.

01:14:42.203 --> 01:14:47.938
But at the time of a great saint

01:14:47.951 --> 01:14:51.389
called as Macchindra Nath and Gorakh Nath,

01:14:51.408 --> 01:14:55.700
they were indulging into

01:14:55.749 --> 01:14:58.816
awakening of Kundalini

01:14:58.865 --> 01:15:04.240
but the condition was that one Guru should give Realisation to only one person.

01:15:04.251 --> 01:15:06.361
Went on like this

01:15:06.370 --> 01:15:08.750
till the twelfth century when

01:15:08.758 --> 01:15:11.351
Gyandeva first of all asked his Guru,

01:15:11.358 --> 01:15:14.680
his own Master was his own brother.

01:15:14.678 --> 01:15:15.720
asked him that,

01:15:15.727 --> 01:15:20.869
“You please allow me to at least write about Kundalini.”

01:15:20.908 --> 01:15:25.956
Because in the Gita it was not described.

01:15:25.982 --> 01:15:29.546
Though Shri Krishna has talked of Sthit Pragnya and all those things

01:15:29.571 --> 01:15:33.112
but he didn’t talk about:

01:15:33.125 --> 01:15:34.131
How to get it?

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:38.429
What is the mechanism within us which works it out?

01:15:38.489 --> 01:15:43.220
Then he wrote it in his Gyaneshwari

01:15:43.268 --> 01:15:46.018
which is just a, I think,

01:15:46.077 --> 01:15:48.797
explanation of Gita very clearly

01:15:48.868 --> 01:15:52.818
that there is a power within us.

01:15:54.088 --> 01:15:56.957
In the sixth chapter he wrote about Kundalini

01:15:57.218 --> 01:16:01.476
but the people who were in charge of religion didn’t want that.

01:16:01.501 --> 01:16:04.161
So they said, “This is a Nishiddha (prohibited) part

01:16:04.221 --> 01:16:07.523
and you should not read this part of Kundalini.”

01:16:07.531 --> 01:16:09.792
But in the sixteenth century

01:16:09.811 --> 01:16:12.619
under the guidance of Guru Nanaka,

01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:13.660
Namdeva,

01:16:13.690 --> 01:16:15.053
Kabira,

01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:21.555
all these people, clearly, clearly, very clearly wrote about Kundalini

01:16:21.601 --> 01:16:25.855
but the way it was mutilated

01:16:25.872 --> 01:16:28.918
by

01:16:28.939 --> 01:16:31.481
people which is very surprising.

01:16:31.499 --> 01:16:33.311
Everything has been mutilated

01:16:33.332 --> 01:16:36.055
but this one was very surprising

01:16:36.086 --> 01:16:39.985
because Kabira was in Bihar

01:16:39.994 --> 01:16:42.285
and he called Kundalini as Surti.

01:16:42.304 --> 01:16:44.885
Very clearly, he said about Surti

01:16:44.894 --> 01:16:50.834
but in Bihar, ‘Surti’ is what you call ‘tobacco’.

01:16:50.856 --> 01:16:52.614
They call ‘tobacco’ as ‘Surti’,

01:16:52.617 --> 01:16:55.690
so you can imagine what is the mutilation.

01:16:55.696 --> 01:16:58.887
Now this power is within you.

01:16:58.936 --> 01:17:00.787
If I am telling you something today

01:17:00.808 --> 01:17:02.588
you need not accept it.

01:17:02.628 --> 01:17:05.207
Blind folded acceptance is of no use.

01:17:05.237 --> 01:17:08.634
We have had enough problems with blind faiths.

01:17:08.648 --> 01:17:10.600
So, first of all

01:17:10.601 --> 01:17:12.170
you must get the experience

01:17:12.182 --> 01:17:16.004
and then you will not doubt it.

01:17:16.001 --> 01:17:19.848
This science was known to us since long

01:17:19.888 --> 01:17:22.208
but as it was only done for one person

01:17:22.237 --> 01:17:25.458
or say ten persons at the most,

01:17:25.468 --> 01:17:28.318
I decided to find out a method by which

01:17:28.348 --> 01:17:32.218
an en-masse Realisation could be given.

01:17:32.239 --> 01:17:35.110
Luckily my father was a very social person

01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:37.809
and I could meet many people.

01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:42.153
Even my husband’s life was such that I could meet many people.

01:17:42.203 --> 01:17:48.804
So, I worked out the permutations and combinations of human problems

01:17:48.855 --> 01:17:50.669
and then I discovered

01:17:50.715 --> 01:17:53.388
how we can easily solve this problem

01:17:53.405 --> 01:17:55.528
of Kundalini awakening.

01:17:55.516 --> 01:17:57.898
Because there are problems

01:17:57.936 --> 01:18:00.049
on the way of its ascent

01:18:00.091 --> 01:18:03.771
then Kundalini doesn’t, Kundalini doesn’t come up.

01:18:03.811 --> 01:18:05.340
Now

01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:07.829
there are seven chakras

01:18:07.891 --> 01:18:10.699
basically within us.

01:18:10.742 --> 01:18:13.826
These seven chakras are responsible

01:18:13.888 --> 01:18:18.484
of our physical, mental and emotional being.

01:18:18.497 --> 01:18:20.184
There is no doubt about it

01:18:20.198 --> 01:18:22.528
but you have to first find out

01:18:22.521 --> 01:18:23.614
and then believe in it.

01:18:23.634 --> 01:18:25.814
Don’t believe because I am saying so

01:18:25.835 --> 01:18:30.117
or anybody says so. You have to experience it and feel it.

01:18:30.124 --> 01:18:32.427
There are many ways we can also judge.

01:18:32.434 --> 01:18:34.927
For example,

01:18:34.948 --> 01:18:36.477
in the Koran,

01:18:36.487 --> 01:18:41.427
Mohammed Sahib has said, “At the time of Kayama, means this time of Resurrection,

01:18:41.468 --> 01:18:43.328
your hands will speak.”

01:18:43.367 --> 01:18:45.287
He also calls it ‘Kayamat’

01:18:45.331 --> 01:18:48.341
means ‘those who will not accept will suffer’.

01:18:48.362 --> 01:18:50.782
But who will accept their hands will speak,

01:18:50.802 --> 01:18:52.073
their

01:18:52.133 --> 01:18:54.773
mouth will be shut and their hands will speak?

01:18:54.843 --> 01:18:57.033
This is exactly what happens in Sahaja Yoga

01:18:57.112 --> 01:19:00.071
that once you get your Self-realisation

01:19:00.117 --> 01:19:03.521
you can feel those subtle centres within you.

01:19:03.557 --> 01:19:05.674
These subtle centres of energy

01:19:05.703 --> 01:19:07.393
are seven in number

01:19:07.417 --> 01:19:15.328
and are acting for giving us all kinds of energies.

01:19:15.377 --> 01:19:18.244
Now the problem is how to make

01:19:18.258 --> 01:19:20.114
people believe in Kundalini.

01:19:20.127 --> 01:19:22.014
It’s a difficult task

01:19:22.016 --> 01:19:23.905
because you are all intellectuals

01:19:23.917 --> 01:19:27.645
and you have had your medical education

01:19:27.657 --> 01:19:30.557
from England and all these places you see.

01:19:30.566 --> 01:19:32.287
It is more westernised

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:34.562
and to believe in something Indian

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:38.403
is rather difficult for people that it’s all Indian after all.

01:19:38.441 --> 01:19:41.550
But actually, even in medical science

01:19:41.621 --> 01:19:44.751
we have to understand the limitations of a science.

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:49.059
First of all, science is amoral.

01:19:50.170 --> 01:19:53.412
Secondly, it does not go to the roots.

01:19:53.417 --> 01:19:57.782
So, it starts like we have to treat a tree.

01:19:57.787 --> 01:19:59.432
So, we treat the leaves,

01:19:59.448 --> 01:20:00.843
treat the branches

01:20:00.893 --> 01:20:03.182
but Sahaja Yoga is going to the roots,

01:20:03.223 --> 01:20:04.900
is the knowledge of the roots.

01:20:04.924 --> 01:20:09.888
And the roots are the seven chakras and our Kundalini.

01:20:10.188 --> 01:20:13.560
Of course, without medical science you cannot also understand Sahaja Yoga.

01:20:13.581 --> 01:20:19.714
That is also one of the things because you can relate very easily. It is very scientific.

01:20:19.730 --> 01:20:22.490
Now there are three Nadis also

01:20:22.541 --> 01:20:25.219
Left, Right and Centre.

01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:28.048
Left is called as Ida Nadi,

01:20:28.129 --> 01:20:29.848
right as Pingala

01:20:29.928 --> 01:20:36.959
and the central one is called as Sushumna Nadi.

01:20:40.677 --> 01:20:43.267
Kabira has described it very clearly

01:20:43.327 --> 01:20:46.213
and it is in the Granth Sahib

01:20:46.233 --> 01:20:49.783
written down but nobody tries to understand

01:20:49.824 --> 01:20:51.343
or to go beyond the words.

01:20:51.363 --> 01:20:54.513
Just go and read the words that is not going to help.

01:20:54.533 --> 01:20:55.943
You have to go beyond it.

01:20:55.945 --> 01:21:01.043
It is like this, you see a beautiful picture say where it’s raining,

01:21:01.074 --> 01:21:05.703
it’s very beautiful and you are seeing it, that’s all.

01:21:05.721 --> 01:21:09.209
But you are not inside it to experience it.

01:21:09.279 --> 01:21:11.829
So, to enter inside was difficult one

01:21:11.899 --> 01:21:15.411
because of the tradition of giving to one person only,

01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:16.889
or to few persons

01:21:16.899 --> 01:21:18.961
and secondly the greatest objection

01:21:18.971 --> 01:21:22.721
came from people, who were in charge of religion

01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:24.240
so called

01:21:24.265 --> 01:21:26.255
Nowadays those who are intellectuals,

01:21:26.276 --> 01:21:32.497
you should say medias and other people

01:21:32.526 --> 01:21:35.634
who have a feeling that they know everything,

01:21:35.643 --> 01:21:39.300
they don’t want to take anything, that is to begin with.

01:21:39.324 --> 01:21:41.401
This is one of the reasons why

01:21:41.416 --> 01:21:46.559
people don’t turn their eyes to the great knowledge we have in this country

01:21:46.576 --> 01:21:50.829
I am so very happy today that

01:21:50.847 --> 01:21:53.499
Indian Medical Association

01:21:53.526 --> 01:21:56.133
has given me this honour first of all

01:21:56.166 --> 01:21:59.478
because I could never imagine in my lifetime,

01:21:59.496 --> 01:22:01.553
I would be able to talk with you.

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:06.037
I also did my medicine and I knew how difficult it was

01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:08.021
and how people were blind.

01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:11.417
So, I used to think, “How will I explain to them”,

01:22:11.458 --> 01:22:12.742
like Kabira has said,

01:22:12.741 --> 01:22:17.982
“Kaise samjhau, sab jag andha” (How to make them understand when the whole world is blind?)

01:22:18.006 --> 01:22:20.642
But the time has come because there are seekers now.

01:22:20.666 --> 01:22:22.811
And they should also know one more thing,

01:22:22.825 --> 01:22:25.252
that this country is the Yogabhoomi.

01:22:25.286 --> 01:22:27.291
They have given us science all right

01:22:27.328 --> 01:22:28.698
but we will give them Yoga.

01:22:28.747 --> 01:22:34.723
We will give them the real basic knowledge

01:22:34.753 --> 01:22:39.822
what is the foundation of Medical Science,

01:22:39.829 --> 01:22:41.849
is the foundation!

01:22:41.869 --> 01:22:46.049
Now by experimenting this and that

01:22:46.049 --> 01:22:49.526
also you have seen that it is neutralised by challenges.

01:22:49.541 --> 01:22:51.569
Every theory is neutralised

01:22:51.579 --> 01:22:54.214
so that means it is not Absolute.

01:22:54.241 --> 01:22:58.253
So, we have to go to something that is absolutely Absolute

01:22:58.291 --> 01:23:01.251
You have seen that Einstein found out something

01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:03.054
then our people are after him

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:06.073
this is wrong, that is wrong, going on like that.

01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:09.543
All the time something comes up, people go on criticising

01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:14.155
and the whole knowledge goes into oblivion.

01:23:14.190 --> 01:23:19.015
So now we have to understand that if this is the Yogabhoomi,

01:23:19.335 --> 01:23:21.167
this is our country

01:23:21.187 --> 01:23:23.969
and if it has given us such a knowledge,

01:23:23.996 --> 01:23:27.267
why should we not also listen to it,

01:23:27.276 --> 01:23:32.772
because not only that it will flower your knowledge of medicine,

01:23:32.796 --> 01:23:39.537
not only that but it will give you such a confidence while practicing,

01:23:39.536 --> 01:23:42.313
while talking about medicine.

01:23:42.324 --> 01:23:45.523
Now as it is a subject,

01:23:45.544 --> 01:23:47.133
is on medicine

01:23:47.153 --> 01:23:50.147
I would like to speak on one of the centres

01:23:50.177 --> 01:23:54.824
which is very important because doctors are always affected by that centre.

01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:58.874
So, I better tell them what can go wrong with doctors

01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:01.757
and what they should be careful about.

01:24:08.775 --> 01:24:13.045
It is to be understood that there is a centre,

01:24:13.094 --> 01:24:17.605
is the second centre which we call as Swadishthan.

01:24:17.619 --> 01:24:19.545
This centre is very interesting.

01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:23.465
It comes out of the Solar Plexus

01:24:23.499 --> 01:24:27.556
we call it a Nabhi Chakra

01:24:27.570 --> 01:24:30.946
and like a lotus and it moves all round you see,

01:24:30.959 --> 01:24:34.826
as you can say in gross way it is Aortic Plexus.

01:24:34.849 --> 01:24:37.028
It supplies energy to Aortic Plexus.

01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:41.516
It is not Aortic Plexus but supplies energy to Aortic Plexus.

01:24:41.527 --> 01:24:46.267
Now this centre is very important

01:24:46.307 --> 01:24:49.128
because it gives energy to our liver,

01:24:49.177 --> 01:24:52.119
to pancreas,

01:24:52.147 --> 01:24:55.689
to our spleen, to our intestines,

01:24:55.704 --> 01:24:56.849
to our kidneys,

01:24:56.854 --> 01:24:59.964
can you imagine such an important centre it is!

01:24:59.951 --> 01:25:01.152
This Swadishthan!

01:25:01.166 --> 01:25:04.262
But the most important work it does is very...

01:25:04.286 --> 01:25:06.612
which I don’t know you will accept or not

01:25:06.646 --> 01:25:10.686
but it supplies energy to our grey cells

01:25:10.701 --> 01:25:13.956
which we are using all the time.

01:25:13.941 --> 01:25:15.924
When we are thinking too much,

01:25:15.931 --> 01:25:19.394
when we are acting physically and mentally,

01:25:19.421 --> 01:25:24.568
this centre has to supply energy to our brain,

01:25:24.561 --> 01:25:28.118
we can call it to our grey cells

01:25:28.142 --> 01:25:31.778
which we are using all the time.

01:25:31.811 --> 01:25:33.118
When we are doctors,

01:25:33.146 --> 01:25:35.426
we are using our grey cells how much?

01:25:35.439 --> 01:25:36.159
We have no idea.

01:25:36.166 --> 01:25:38.882
There is nobody who has found out

01:25:38.916 --> 01:25:40.685
how much we use our brains,

01:25:40.756 --> 01:25:45.718
but we are going exhausting our brains and also, we are very futuristic.

01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:47.888
All doctors are futuristic.

01:25:47.911 --> 01:25:52.632
Maybe they want to find out something

01:25:52.692 --> 01:25:54.753
in the pure sense of the word

01:25:54.770 --> 01:25:57.363
or maybe they have certain ideas

01:25:57.384 --> 01:25:59.170
or maybe it is money,

01:25:59.181 --> 01:26:02.190
may be anything but they are very, very futuristic

01:26:02.201 --> 01:26:05.863
and in that trend of futuristic behaviour also

01:26:05.892 --> 01:26:07.728
there is a big competition

01:26:07.742 --> 01:26:09.448
so they don’t know what to do.

01:26:09.474 --> 01:26:13.018
They have to be futuristic and think but what will happen.

01:26:13.028 --> 01:26:20.497
Now in this kind of movement of the mind

01:26:20.512 --> 01:26:21.310
what happens

01:26:21.340 --> 01:26:23.899
we start becoming very right sided,

01:26:23.897 --> 01:26:25.489
extremely right sided.

01:26:25.517 --> 01:26:27.289
Now as a result of that,

01:26:27.295 --> 01:26:29.545
as a right sided man, you know

01:26:29.565 --> 01:26:31.834
I would say what medically can happen,

01:26:31.854 --> 01:26:35.559
of course also happens lot of things mentally also.

01:26:35.574 --> 01:26:40.205
But what can happen medically,

01:26:40.214 --> 01:26:42.175
this Swadishthan Chakra

01:26:42.224 --> 01:26:44.264
which has to supply to your liver.

01:26:44.275 --> 01:26:45.974
Why do you call it ‘liver’?

01:26:45.994 --> 01:26:47.805
Because of liver we live.

01:26:47.805 --> 01:26:51.926
Liver is very important in Sahaja Yoga.

01:26:51.972 --> 01:26:55.166
I know that in medicine we don’t know much about liver

01:26:55.171 --> 01:26:59.725
and it is absolutely curable in Sahaja Yoga.

01:26:59.732 --> 01:27:01.166
But now what happens,

01:27:01.195 --> 01:27:06.634
liver is the one which takes all the poison of the body

01:27:06.652 --> 01:27:11.191
and throws it into the circulation.

01:27:11.205 --> 01:27:13.744
That everyone knows, all right!

01:27:13.752 --> 01:27:18.272
Now when liver is looked after it is normal,

01:27:18.281 --> 01:27:20.451
then we have also a pancreas,

01:27:20.482 --> 01:27:23.112
then we have spleen

01:27:23.161 --> 01:27:25.181
and also kidneys

01:27:25.216 --> 01:27:28.392
and the last part of intestines,

01:27:28.441 --> 01:27:31.757
intestines as a whole but the last part is very important.

01:27:31.778 --> 01:27:34.538
So, such a man who is always thinking

01:27:34.589 --> 01:27:37.817
all his energy is going to his brain

01:27:37.829 --> 01:27:40.209
and all these organs are neglected

01:27:40.278 --> 01:27:43.663
and he can be affected by any one of them

01:27:43.666 --> 01:27:47.523
So, the first thing he is affected is bad liver.

01:27:47.546 --> 01:27:49.329
Now this bad liver

01:27:49.344 --> 01:27:53.498
because it cannot throw its heat,

01:27:53.523 --> 01:27:55.547
which is the poison of the body

01:27:55.557 --> 01:27:56.858
into the circulation.

01:27:56.907 --> 01:28:00.057
What happens that it starts, heat starts rising,

01:28:00.088 --> 01:28:03.588
this heat goes higher on the right side.

01:28:03.647 --> 01:28:05.318
We call it Right Heart

01:28:05.297 --> 01:28:08.778
which is the centre which controls the lungs.

01:28:08.758 --> 01:28:11.718
So, such a person can get Asthma.

01:28:11.735 --> 01:28:14.428
Now Asthma has been cured through Sahaja Yoga,

01:28:14.455 --> 01:28:16.018
very simple way.

01:28:16.089 --> 01:28:17.625
But it can be cured,

01:28:17.638 --> 01:28:23.215
it gets Asthma. We say it is incurable because we don't know about Swadishthan.

01:28:23.238 --> 01:28:26.985
Now this same thing happens to our…

01:28:27.056 --> 01:28:30.017
when it moves to the left side pancreas.

01:28:30.046 --> 01:28:32.447
Mostly people who are sitting on their chairs

01:28:32.484 --> 01:28:35.004
and thinking too much and planning too much

01:28:35.012 --> 01:28:36.484
get diabetes.

01:28:41.205 --> 01:28:43.945
Sugar doesn’t give you diabetes.

01:28:43.959 --> 01:28:47.650
In Maharashtra, I don’t know maybe here also in the villages,

01:28:47.670 --> 01:28:51.235
a villager will take sugar

01:28:51.245 --> 01:28:54.505
in such a way that the spoon must stand at the right angles

01:28:54.530 --> 01:28:56.945
That’s the way

01:28:56.975 --> 01:28:59.309
a tea has to be made otherwise it is not tea,

01:28:59.329 --> 01:29:00.869
but he never gets diabetes,

01:29:00.844 --> 01:29:06.458
because he earns without any insurance or anything, spends it sleeps off.

01:29:06.475 --> 01:29:07.838
Next day he earns.

01:29:07.850 --> 01:29:10.017
He does not have botheration about future.

01:29:10.041 --> 01:29:11.141
What he should do?

01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:12.646
He should accumulate money

01:29:12.685 --> 01:29:15.417
or he should give it to somebody? Nothing.

01:29:15.417 --> 01:29:18.372
He just lives with himself.

01:29:18.386 --> 01:29:21.652
Now this goes to pancreas,

01:29:21.682 --> 01:29:23.262
gives you diabetes,

01:29:23.272 --> 01:29:24.091
this heat

01:29:24.132 --> 01:29:25.953
Then it goes down

01:29:25.972 --> 01:29:29.613
then the kidney, kidney it coagulates.

01:29:29.623 --> 01:29:31.833
Now for kidney if you go to dialysis,

01:29:31.853 --> 01:29:32.953
I must tell you

01:29:32.963 --> 01:29:34.271
not that only you die

01:29:34.282 --> 01:29:38.583
but you die bankrupt it is a fact.

01:29:39.968 --> 01:29:43.983
Now in no way I want to criticise doctors,

01:29:44.044 --> 01:29:45.964
they have to earn after all,

01:29:45.974 --> 01:29:47.794
but there is a simple way

01:29:47.814 --> 01:29:50.594
of curing this kidney trouble

01:29:50.574 --> 01:29:52.474
And once this kidney is cured,

01:29:52.464 --> 01:29:54.939
it is cured forever

01:29:54.946 --> 01:29:57.660
So, by helping Swadishthan

01:29:57.666 --> 01:30:01.076
you can cure also kidney.

01:30:01.076 --> 01:30:03.290
But the most difficult thing

01:30:03.306 --> 01:30:04.877
is the spleen.

01:30:04.916 --> 01:30:08.377
Now in modern times

01:30:08.418 --> 01:30:10.234
we are very hectic

01:30:10.248 --> 01:30:11.044
For example,

01:30:11.067 --> 01:30:14.393
most of the doctors have to get up early in the morning

01:30:14.413 --> 01:30:15.913
on duty.

01:30:15.948 --> 01:30:18.785
In college we also used to do the same thing.

01:30:18.787 --> 01:30:19.805
Then we have no time

01:30:19.837 --> 01:30:21.951
to eat our food properly nothing.

01:30:21.971 --> 01:30:24.384
And we take our breakfast with us sometimes.

01:30:24.418 --> 01:30:25.296
In America

01:30:25.315 --> 01:30:27.716
I have seen doctors even brushing their teeth

01:30:27.736 --> 01:30:30.012
in the car.

01:30:30.026 --> 01:30:31.825
It is the limit of things.

01:30:31.825 --> 01:30:35.124
So, in this kind of a hectic life

01:30:35.184 --> 01:30:36.344
what happens:

01:30:36.364 --> 01:30:37.454
the spleen, poor thing

01:30:37.495 --> 01:30:41.075
which has to produce RBCs for emergencies

01:30:41.094 --> 01:30:42.212
gets mad.

01:30:42.234 --> 01:30:44.084
She can’t understand,

01:30:44.083 --> 01:30:46.293
“What is the matter with this gentleman?”

01:30:46.343 --> 01:30:51.761
and it cannot also a sort of cooperate

01:30:51.805 --> 01:30:53.954
with all the madness we have.

01:30:53.985 --> 01:30:55.469
Then we read newspapers.

01:30:55.485 --> 01:30:57.798
Reading newspapers in the morning

01:30:57.825 --> 01:30:59.568
is a very dangerous thing

01:30:59.594 --> 01:31:02.016
because every day you see something horrible

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.486
and you get such a fright.

01:31:03.506 --> 01:31:06.437
For example, these days our country is in doldrums.

01:31:06.477 --> 01:31:07.681
I never read it in the morning

01:31:07.730 --> 01:31:08.997
at any cost

01:31:09.020 --> 01:31:11.470
But if you read it early in the morning any newspaper

01:31:11.561 --> 01:31:13.514
then finished, you will get some…

01:31:13.536 --> 01:31:17.217
They only tell you about what has gone wrong;

01:31:17.237 --> 01:31:19.487
disasters, accidents,

01:31:19.546 --> 01:31:21.991
if not that then political crisis,

01:31:22.007 --> 01:31:24.740
this that which upsets you.

01:31:24.777 --> 01:31:26.631
Whether you like it or not

01:31:26.664 --> 01:31:28.601
but it upsets you.

01:31:28.626 --> 01:31:32.040
So, reading newspaper early in the morning,

01:31:32.056 --> 01:31:36.573
then just running forward.

01:31:36.583 --> 01:31:37.823
No time for wife,

01:31:37.892 --> 01:31:40.043
no time for children, nothing.

01:31:40.083 --> 01:31:43.973
Formerly I remember that husband used to eat nicely

01:31:43.992 --> 01:31:45.234
at about ten o’clock.

01:31:45.237 --> 01:31:47.056
The wife used to fan him

01:31:47.126 --> 01:31:51.717
because there might be some flies around.

01:31:51.717 --> 01:31:53.998
She used to fan

01:31:54.017 --> 01:31:59.758
and relaxed way they used to eat food and live relaxed.

01:31:59.778 --> 01:32:03.149
Now what you call in Urdu language

01:32:03.169 --> 01:32:05.669
‘Kashmakash’ (Mental Struggle) is so much,

01:32:05.679 --> 01:32:07.859
that people are just running mad.

01:32:07.936 --> 01:32:09.565
They don’t know what to do.

01:32:09.635 --> 01:32:10.796
Now they go to the office,

01:32:10.796 --> 01:32:12.885
then they find, doctors especially,

01:32:12.885 --> 01:32:14.440
the boss is angry

01:32:14.490 --> 01:32:17.104
or there is some very serious patient has come,

01:32:17.111 --> 01:32:19.220
somebody has died by mistake.

01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:23.270
I mean doctors are completely treated

01:32:23.290 --> 01:32:24.881
like criminals in America,

01:32:24.931 --> 01:32:26.720
absolutely like criminals.

01:32:26.780 --> 01:32:28.861
So, this is also coming here.

01:32:28.874 --> 01:32:30.694
If they do anything wrong by mistake,

01:32:30.755 --> 01:32:33.755
they do something, finished.

01:32:33.785 --> 01:32:35.090
Their practice is gone,

01:32:35.124 --> 01:32:37.370
they are put in jail.

01:32:37.384 --> 01:32:40.132
I mean after all they're human beings

01:32:40.152 --> 01:32:42.363
but this consideration is not there

01:32:42.373 --> 01:32:47.502
And so, this futuristic life makes them really crazy people.

01:32:47.553 --> 01:32:49.103
Then they become very hot tempered.

01:32:49.113 --> 01:32:50.138
Liver gives you heat,

01:32:50.163 --> 01:32:52.943
you become very hot tempered at the slightest thing,

01:32:52.973 --> 01:32:54.318
you just shoot off

01:32:54.334 --> 01:32:57.152
and start saying things which you should never have said.

01:32:57.173 --> 01:32:58.752
Then you feel guilty.

01:32:58.768 --> 01:33:02.139
When you feel guilty you catch this centre here,

01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:03.528
left Vishuddhi we call it

01:33:03.578 --> 01:33:05.939
by which you develop spondylitis.

01:33:06.008 --> 01:33:07.425
If not spondylitis,

01:33:07.459 --> 01:33:10.365
there is something horrible thing can happen to you.

01:33:10.391 --> 01:33:12.686
Now according to Sahaja Yoga,

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:14.936
we have two types of heart attacks.

01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:17.982
One is an active massive heart attack

01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:21.734
and another one is what you call lethargic

01:33:21.767 --> 01:33:23.567
like angina.

01:33:23.584 --> 01:33:28.158
So, the first one which happens

01:33:28.153 --> 01:33:29.698
is the massive one

01:33:29.703 --> 01:33:33.249
where same thing the heat reaches the heart.

01:33:33.258 --> 01:33:34.769
Now say there is a boy

01:33:34.778 --> 01:33:36.719
who is playing tennis

01:33:36.738 --> 01:33:38.739
at the age of twenty-one or twenty-two

01:33:38.778 --> 01:33:42.122
and is drinking also, competing with his father.

01:33:42.159 --> 01:33:45.462
So, he gets that massive heart attack

01:33:46.109 --> 01:33:48.274
and it is absolutely fatal.

01:33:48.354 --> 01:33:50.725
He cannot live after that.

01:33:50.784 --> 01:33:53.521
This is a very common case you must have also seen.

01:33:53.570 --> 01:33:56.477
I am not telling you something out of the blue.

01:33:56.491 --> 01:33:58.697
But the another one is

01:33:58.719 --> 01:34:01.629
if you continue with this kind of thing

01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:06.098
then maybe one day you might get massive heart attacks

01:34:06.129 --> 01:34:07.908
especially the industrialists.

01:34:07.949 --> 01:34:10.868
Industrialists are so much futuristic,

01:34:10.879 --> 01:34:12.360
so much calculating

01:34:12.409 --> 01:34:18.789
that they don’t calculate that this will entail

01:34:18.803 --> 01:34:21.274
their own heart trouble

01:34:21.333 --> 01:34:25.242
So, this heart suddenly collapses and they die.

01:34:25.244 --> 01:34:29.101
This is a, we call it an active heart attack

01:34:29.166 --> 01:34:30.805
due to over acting.

01:34:30.876 --> 01:34:33.015
Another one is lethargic heart attack

01:34:33.075 --> 01:34:34.285
like angina,

01:34:34.356 --> 01:34:38.485
that is if this centre is caught here, if you feel guilty.

01:34:38.515 --> 01:34:42.216
Some people are very sensitive and very formal type

01:34:42.275 --> 01:34:43.588
you know, they feel guilty,

01:34:43.606 --> 01:34:45.188
“I should have done this.”

01:34:45.206 --> 01:34:46.348
I have known people

01:34:46.366 --> 01:34:47.866
who have been crying all their life,

01:34:47.886 --> 01:34:51.093
“I spilled coffee on the table of such and such.”

01:34:51.091 --> 01:34:53.918
I say, “Let it be, now gone finished. Why are you bothered?”

01:34:53.914 --> 01:34:55.448
But they’ll go on and on and on.

01:34:55.444 --> 01:34:57.744
It’s a habit they have formed

01:34:57.793 --> 01:34:59.714
to feel guilty about this.

01:34:59.764 --> 01:35:02.394
So, about anything they start feeling guilty.

01:35:02.414 --> 01:35:06.536
In India we are not so much I think formal type

01:35:06.627 --> 01:35:07.974
of people, thank God.

01:35:08.016 --> 01:35:10.177
So, I find less cases of this

01:35:10.226 --> 01:35:14.194
but still there are many people who develop this left side.

01:35:14.224 --> 01:35:18.342
Not only with that you develop your spondylitis,

01:35:18.371 --> 01:35:22.672
but you develop a situation

01:35:22.683 --> 01:35:27.534
where heart cannot pump blood for your brain,

01:35:27.544 --> 01:35:30.266
that is angina.

01:35:30.304 --> 01:35:33.834
Nobody knows that it comes from this left side problem;

01:35:33.834 --> 01:35:36.475
Left side problems come from other things also,

01:35:36.514 --> 01:35:39.986
but one of them is feeling guilty.

01:35:40.003 --> 01:35:41.948
This is something I am telling you which

01:35:41.973 --> 01:35:45.047
is not yet told in medical science.

01:35:45.062 --> 01:35:48.099
But I am sure one day we will have it from India.

01:35:48.126 --> 01:35:49.286
We will tell these people

01:35:49.337 --> 01:35:54.076
what we know about the roots of trouble.

01:35:54.097 --> 01:35:56.581
The root of trouble is like that.

01:35:56.597 --> 01:35:59.680
So now the last but not the least

01:35:59.706 --> 01:36:02.091
is the effect of Swadishthan

01:36:02.107 --> 01:36:04.887
is this heat reaches the brain

01:36:04.937 --> 01:36:07.687
and gives you paralysis on the left hand side

01:36:07.687 --> 01:36:10.347
because you know it crosses over nerves.

01:36:10.377 --> 01:36:13.177
So, it gives you a terrible paralysis

01:36:13.157 --> 01:36:15.956
on the left-hand side but you feel it on the right-hand side.

01:36:15.966 --> 01:36:19.706
Also, nature is the one which tries to stop it.

01:36:19.726 --> 01:36:22.766
If you don’t stop, it says, “All right, I will stop your right side.”

01:36:22.763 --> 01:36:25.626
Left side will be all right.

01:36:25.632 --> 01:36:30.137
Now the one side of life is also right side.

01:36:30.117 --> 01:36:34.120
Second side, another side we can say

01:36:34.097 --> 01:36:36.006
is the side which is left side.

01:36:36.066 --> 01:36:38.326
And the left side and right side when they meet,

01:36:38.387 --> 01:36:41.316
you get psychosomatic trouble.

01:36:41.326 --> 01:36:44.197
With this Kundalini rising what happens

01:36:44.187 --> 01:36:46.816
that it nourishes those centres.

01:36:46.837 --> 01:36:49.306
For example, see this is one centre formed

01:36:49.347 --> 01:36:50.986
by two left and right side.

01:36:50.986 --> 01:36:53.830
This is a centre; left and right side.

01:36:53.838 --> 01:36:56.399
Now the Kundalini passes through this.

01:36:56.428 --> 01:36:59.669
But supposing you are using right side too much like this

01:36:59.687 --> 01:37:01.729
and suddenly left side breaks sometimes

01:37:01.737 --> 01:37:03.536
then what happens

01:37:03.588 --> 01:37:09.725
that your connection with the main,

01:37:09.754 --> 01:37:11.841
you should say

01:37:11.864 --> 01:37:13.431
mains is lost.

01:37:13.465 --> 01:37:17.312
You are on your own and cancer starts.

01:37:17.334 --> 01:37:19.542
Now this cancer can be cured also;

01:37:19.564 --> 01:37:21.705
I am sorry to say but it is a fact.

01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:22.730
It can be cured.

01:37:22.745 --> 01:37:25.650
Cancer can be cured,

01:37:25.670 --> 01:37:29.333
not at a galloping stage I think but at an early stage.

01:37:29.352 --> 01:37:33.406
We have also tried some galloping stage people.

01:37:33.426 --> 01:37:34.666
They have improved

01:37:34.686 --> 01:37:37.847
but still I would say it is not guaranteed at that stage.

01:37:37.861 --> 01:37:40.232
After all nothing is guaranteed

01:37:40.302 --> 01:37:43.893
but still it works and it has worked.

01:37:43.931 --> 01:37:47.726
Now when this cancer is caused

01:37:47.746 --> 01:37:49.556
you see, what is our job

01:37:49.583 --> 01:37:51.996
is to push back this left side with the right

01:37:51.994 --> 01:37:55.379
and also through Kundalini awakening to nourish,

01:37:55.399 --> 01:37:56.599
nourish the centre

01:37:56.668 --> 01:38:00.138
You see this is the basis for our health

01:38:00.148 --> 01:38:04.738
our... you can say... mind,

01:38:04.789 --> 01:38:08.264
everything it’s a mental, physical and emotional

01:38:08.354 --> 01:38:10.185
but also spiritual

01:38:10.245 --> 01:38:13.308
because when Kundalini rises like this;

01:38:13.334 --> 01:38:18.462
it goes crosses over this fontanelle bone area.

01:38:18.482 --> 01:38:21.131
This is Kabira has said,

01:38:21.191 --> 01:38:23.341
“Shunya shikhar par anahat baje re.”

01:38:23.422 --> 01:38:26.593
Nobody can explain what does he say.

01:38:26.611 --> 01:38:28.194
“Shunya shikhar par anahat,”

01:38:28.216 --> 01:38:29.073
is the heartbeat.

01:38:29.095 --> 01:38:33.956
How can a heartbeat come up? ‘Shunya shikhar’ means ‘on the fontanelle bone area’

01:38:34.026 --> 01:38:35.046
He was not mad

01:38:35.095 --> 01:38:38.366
but the people who do not understand

01:38:38.436 --> 01:38:43.116
cannot think that this Kundalini reaches here. It does.

01:38:43.146 --> 01:38:44.666
You can see for yourself;

01:38:44.696 --> 01:38:46.216
it does reach here

01:38:46.265 --> 01:38:50.763
and once it breaks, this sound is finished

01:38:50.785 --> 01:38:52.063
Then on your nerves,

01:38:52.093 --> 01:38:54.859
you are amazed on your central nervous system

01:38:54.918 --> 01:38:57.238
you start feeling the cool breeze

01:38:57.299 --> 01:39:00.764
of the Holy Ghost as they call it in the Bible

01:39:00.799 --> 01:39:04.860
or they call it as the Alakh Niranjan

01:39:04.914 --> 01:39:07.174
or they call it as Brahma Chaitanya.

01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:10.090
You start feeling it on your fingertips,

01:39:10.110 --> 01:39:12.274
on your hands, you can.

01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:16.583
If you experience that, still you go on saying, “No, no, no. I do not believe in anything.”

01:39:16.633 --> 01:39:17.714
It’s all right.

01:39:17.774 --> 01:39:20.484
But if you really start moving into that line

01:39:20.533 --> 01:39:22.745
and start feeling that,

01:39:22.764 --> 01:39:24.515
then you are amazed

01:39:24.544 --> 01:39:28.406
because when the Kundalini rises as I told you,

01:39:28.435 --> 01:39:29.844
She helps you physically.

01:39:29.854 --> 01:39:33.296
I have told you about only one chakra but there are seven chakras.

01:39:33.314 --> 01:39:35.126
So, all these seven chakras,

01:39:35.176 --> 01:39:39.276
they give permutation, combination of these three channels.

01:39:39.285 --> 01:39:40.897
It cures all.

01:39:40.896 --> 01:39:47.289
As a result, you start enjoying your life.

01:39:47.305 --> 01:39:47.904
You become

01:39:47.918 --> 01:39:51.464
what you call a person who is a witness to this whole thing.

01:39:51.504 --> 01:39:53.573
The whole thing becomes just a drama

01:39:53.593 --> 01:39:55.745
and you start living,

01:39:55.764 --> 01:39:58.135
seeing it so clearly.

01:39:58.135 --> 01:40:00.641
This is first thing happens to you.

01:40:00.681 --> 01:40:03.823
Now if you have something serious

01:40:03.841 --> 01:40:06.520
or say something you have to operate somewhere

01:40:06.532 --> 01:40:08.570
then you are nervous already,

01:40:08.581 --> 01:40:09.443
“How can I do it?”

01:40:09.483 --> 01:40:11.911
If you are nervous, then how can you operate?

01:40:11.973 --> 01:40:14.669
And also because of specialisation

01:40:14.689 --> 01:40:16.618
you can only do one part.

01:40:16.661 --> 01:40:18.927
I have known people, surgeons also,

01:40:18.937 --> 01:40:21.628
who have opened the body they said, “No this is not my job.

01:40:21.658 --> 01:40:24.706
This is the job of that doctor.”

01:40:24.747 --> 01:40:27.828
So, you know the complete knowledge

01:40:27.838 --> 01:40:29.684
of medical science, complete!

01:40:29.707 --> 01:40:31.363
It’s not only surgery,

01:40:31.370 --> 01:40:35.661
it’s not only what you call medicine and others;

01:40:35.661 --> 01:40:37.745
we have learnt so many.

01:40:37.754 --> 01:40:40.454
So, all that becomes a totality.

01:40:40.483 --> 01:40:41.908
In totality you know

01:40:41.914 --> 01:40:44.944
what is wrong with it on your fingertips.

01:40:44.959 --> 01:40:50.139
For diagnosis, you know a patient dies after it

01:40:50.152 --> 01:40:52.225
If somebody goes to say

01:40:52.253 --> 01:40:55.646
“Houston” for diagnosis,

01:40:55.651 --> 01:40:56.935
you should insure him

01:40:56.941 --> 01:40:59.574
because maybe he might die with diagnosis only.

01:40:59.591 --> 01:41:00.656
It’s like this,

01:41:00.681 --> 01:41:03.136
here diagnosis is only on fingertips.

01:41:03.161 --> 01:41:05.270
On the fingertips you can feel very easily

01:41:05.266 --> 01:41:07.419
what is the central catch.

01:41:07.407 --> 01:41:08.560
Now if you learn

01:41:08.546 --> 01:41:09.449
or if you know

01:41:09.447 --> 01:41:11.790
what are these centres meant for,

01:41:11.796 --> 01:41:13.719
if you know what they are related to

01:41:13.736 --> 01:41:15.469
as far as your physical side is concerned

01:41:15.478 --> 01:41:16.600
for doctors,

01:41:16.619 --> 01:41:18.249
then you will know

01:41:18.271 --> 01:41:21.231
that this person is suffering from this disease.

01:41:21.261 --> 01:41:24.190
Even small children, say ten children,

01:41:24.190 --> 01:41:28.964
you tie up their eyes and ask them,

01:41:29.014 --> 01:41:30.792
“What is this person suffering from?”

01:41:30.816 --> 01:41:33.215
So immediately supposing they give this

01:41:33.222 --> 01:41:36.435
you ask that fellow, “What about your throat? Is it all right?”

01:41:36.421 --> 01:41:37.745
“Ah no, it is not all right.”

01:41:37.764 --> 01:41:39.004
But how do they know?

01:41:39.002 --> 01:41:41.462
Because on the fingertip they know,

01:41:41.478 --> 01:41:43.032
they show the finger.

01:41:43.081 --> 01:41:45.591
So, everybody will say the same thing,

01:41:45.641 --> 01:41:47.802
because it is Absolute.

01:41:47.871 --> 01:41:49.345
This All-pervading Power

01:41:49.341 --> 01:41:51.315
about which people have talked about,

01:41:51.331 --> 01:41:52.985
they have called it Brahma Chaitanya

01:41:52.991 --> 01:41:54.926
They have called it all kinds of things

01:41:54.930 --> 01:41:57.515
but they don’t know what it is.

01:41:57.515 --> 01:42:01.810
It is this power that starts flowing

01:42:01.811 --> 01:42:03.739
and when it starts flowing through you,

01:42:03.739 --> 01:42:05.909
tremendous things happen,

01:42:05.909 --> 01:42:08.760
tremendous things happen.

01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:10.481
I have known so many bureaucrats

01:42:10.479 --> 01:42:12.251
you see, were so much worried, upset;

01:42:12.281 --> 01:42:14.751
because they were honest people and were suffering.

01:42:14.781 --> 01:42:15.781
They took to Sahaja Yoga.

01:42:15.791 --> 01:42:18.640
Their lives are changed now, they are enjoying themselves.

01:42:18.630 --> 01:42:20.160
They are not bothered.

01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:23.504
Because this not only guides you,

01:42:23.501 --> 01:42:25.174
this not only gives you knowledge

01:42:25.177 --> 01:42:27.393
but also protects you all the time.

01:42:27.397 --> 01:42:28.616
I have seen many doctors

01:42:28.617 --> 01:42:30.745
who are doing say heart trouble.

01:42:30.756 --> 01:42:33.835
Heart patients they are looking after.

01:42:33.851 --> 01:42:36.762
There are doctors who are curing cancer patients

01:42:36.792 --> 01:42:41.581
I met one doctor who has a dialysis hospital;

01:42:41.641 --> 01:42:45.899
but his kidneys.

01:42:45.948 --> 01:42:48.695
I said, “Doctor, how have you got this?”

01:42:48.688 --> 01:42:53.415
So, he is just treating only people for dialysis and he gets his kidneys

01:42:53.438 --> 01:42:56.145
So, there is no protection.

01:42:56.156 --> 01:42:59.736
You should also have the protection as a surgeon has.

01:42:59.768 --> 01:43:01.819
He will tie up his hands and everything.

01:43:01.869 --> 01:43:06.056
But then otherwise normally doctors have no protection of any kind

01:43:06.084 --> 01:43:08.044
when they treat another person

01:43:08.064 --> 01:43:09.514
and if they are sensitive,

01:43:09.574 --> 01:43:12.610
they may catch from them slowly, slowly the diseases,

01:43:12.635 --> 01:43:14.460
which they are going to cure.

01:43:14.492 --> 01:43:17.591
This is also a point nobody thinks of.

01:43:17.588 --> 01:43:20.301
We are not machines, we are human beings,

01:43:20.297 --> 01:43:24.772
we are not a stone, but we are sensitive

01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:27.351
and when you see somebody suffering

01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:30.076
you catch from them.

01:43:30.100 --> 01:43:31.351
You definitely catch

01:43:31.367 --> 01:43:33.809
but in Sahaja Yoga you know you are catching.

01:43:33.836 --> 01:43:36.509
In Sahaja Yoga you know what you are catching

01:43:36.529 --> 01:43:40.829
and you know how to clear it out and how to protect yourself.

01:43:40.899 --> 01:43:43.399
Now this is what one doesn’t understand

01:43:43.458 --> 01:43:46.896
that all human beings can get their Self-realisation,

01:43:46.908 --> 01:43:47.976
all of them.

01:43:48.003 --> 01:43:51.132
Only thing if you are thinking

01:43:51.142 --> 01:43:54.166
that you are a great scientist

01:43:54.183 --> 01:43:57.907
and you are above everything and you have read everything,

01:43:57.933 --> 01:43:59.881
“I don’t have to know anything”,

01:43:59.897 --> 01:44:01.661
then it doesn’t work.

01:44:01.677 --> 01:44:03.052
It cannot force.

01:44:03.056 --> 01:44:06.171
Sahaja Yoga cannot force on you its knowledge, nothing.

01:44:06.206 --> 01:44:09.830
It respects you, and respects your freedom.

01:44:09.844 --> 01:44:11.354
Freedom has been given to you

01:44:11.385 --> 01:44:14.885
whether you take to it or don’t take to it, is your own.

01:44:14.885 --> 01:44:19.874
But if you want it, if you are really desirous of getting it

01:44:19.881 --> 01:44:21.844
then you get it.

01:44:21.851 --> 01:44:23.562
But with that you get knowledge

01:44:23.621 --> 01:44:25.604
not only about medical science

01:44:25.591 --> 01:44:28.025
but also about people.

01:44:28.069 --> 01:44:33.324
Now there are so many types of God men coming.

01:44:33.338 --> 01:44:35.797
Now how will you know they are not correct?

01:44:35.813 --> 01:44:37.813
How will you?

01:44:37.853 --> 01:44:41.994
How will you know that Guru Nanaka was a great,

01:44:41.984 --> 01:44:44.754
not only saint but an incarnation?

01:44:44.754 --> 01:44:46.246
How will you know about Christ?

01:44:46.296 --> 01:44:48.947
How will you know about anyone of them

01:44:48.956 --> 01:44:50.746
because you don’t know the Absolute?

01:44:50.766 --> 01:44:52.124
You are born like that,

01:44:52.137 --> 01:44:53.937
but once you are born in Sahaja Yoga,

01:44:53.986 --> 01:44:55.476
you become a Yogi.

01:44:55.526 --> 01:44:59.012
And then you know exactly that they are all one.

01:44:59.014 --> 01:45:00.572
All the Sufis are one,

01:45:00.573 --> 01:45:03.282
all these great Prophets are one.

01:45:03.312 --> 01:45:08.241
All these we can call them Prophets

01:45:08.254 --> 01:45:10.281
and also incarnations,

01:45:10.287 --> 01:45:12.610
they're altogether one.

01:45:12.588 --> 01:45:14.168
Christ himself has said,

01:45:14.237 --> 01:45:16.437
“Those who are not against us are with us.”

01:45:16.487 --> 01:45:18.849
But how many Christians understand this?

01:45:18.878 --> 01:45:21.559
So, there is no need to have different, different religions.

01:45:21.563 --> 01:45:25.343
It’s in one big huge ocean of knowledge

01:45:25.393 --> 01:45:29.613
which has different, different, we can say, ports

01:45:29.664 --> 01:45:32.421
but that doesn’t mean the ocean is different.

01:45:32.421 --> 01:45:34.417
All your problems will be solved

01:45:34.496 --> 01:45:38.387
as far as integration of religions are concerned

01:45:38.407 --> 01:45:40.837
and you don’t have to give up anything

01:45:40.839 --> 01:45:42.437
but respect everything

01:45:42.438 --> 01:45:47.066
in the right manner that you know about them.

01:45:47.074 --> 01:45:48.834
There is nothing to discard,

01:45:48.905 --> 01:45:51.487
nothing to condemn

01:45:51.504 --> 01:45:54.385
but you just, to know about them,

01:45:54.395 --> 01:45:56.431
then you are amazed

01:45:56.451 --> 01:45:59.674
how they are talking the same thing what you are talking.

01:45:59.681 --> 01:46:01.534
I have read a book

01:46:01.534 --> 01:46:06.414
written by a one great Sufi from Turkey

01:46:06.426 --> 01:46:11.311
and another I have read it with our Nisamuddin

01:46:11.335 --> 01:46:14.331
here who had written something

01:46:14.366 --> 01:46:16.781
and his disciples, just the same,

01:46:16.774 --> 01:46:18.621
they write the same thing.

01:46:18.623 --> 01:46:20.446
I mean there is no difference

01:46:20.466 --> 01:46:22.613
because absolute knowledge is the same,

01:46:22.643 --> 01:46:24.533
only expression may be different.

01:46:24.603 --> 01:46:27.264
They might use different expressions.

01:46:27.323 --> 01:46:31.246
So, you get out of this madness of religion also.

01:46:31.246 --> 01:46:33.928
Religion can never teach you to hate anyone,

01:46:33.937 --> 01:46:34.808
can never,

01:46:34.867 --> 01:46:39.368
because I am talking here about the power of love.

01:46:39.398 --> 01:46:43.016
This All-pervading Power is the power of love.

01:46:43.026 --> 01:46:44.036
It guides you;

01:46:44.056 --> 01:46:45.306
it looks after you,

01:46:45.357 --> 01:46:47.792
it cooperates, it coordinates.

01:46:47.812 --> 01:46:50.512
It is so efficient a government

01:46:50.541 --> 01:46:55.297
that I don’t think we can ever imagine how efficient it is

01:46:55.321 --> 01:46:57.637
and it works just like this.

01:46:58.505 --> 01:47:00.344
Sometimes it is very amazing

01:47:00.364 --> 01:47:03.025
I will tell you now, today a case of a lady

01:47:03.114 --> 01:47:06.840
which is a true case. Is she here now?

01:47:06.844 --> 01:47:08.449
Mexican, no?

01:47:08.459 --> 01:47:10.120
She might be here

01:47:10.130 --> 01:47:12.318
See, there's a lady. You are there!

01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:13.888
She is a lady here.

01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:17.823
She was working with the UN and when I went to New York, she got her Realisation

01:47:17.882 --> 01:47:21.783
and she became a very ardent Sahaja Yogi.

01:47:21.792 --> 01:47:24.752
It rose to that thing where we call shraddha.

01:47:28.893 --> 01:47:31.518
Then she wrote to me three letters

01:47:31.578 --> 01:47:36.263
telling me about some disease her son has got

01:47:36.332 --> 01:47:40.553
who is only eighteen years of age studying in Harvard University or something.

01:47:40.652 --> 01:47:45.280
She said, “Mother this disease some people get it in my family at old age and they die.”

01:47:45.301 --> 01:47:47.272
” It’s a special Mexican disease,

01:47:47.321 --> 01:47:49.710
it’s a big name as usual you see.

01:47:49.723 --> 01:47:53.984
So, I was thinking what to write to her

01:47:53.982 --> 01:47:56.333
and we’re just paying attention.

01:47:56.393 --> 01:47:59.904
And she said, “Should I bring my child there, what should I do?” and all that.

01:47:59.913 --> 01:48:01.714
And the fourth letter I find

01:48:01.794 --> 01:48:06.165
that the doctors have said that he is completely cured,

01:48:06.174 --> 01:48:08.056
there is nothing in it.

01:48:08.062 --> 01:48:10.598
Just imagine how quick it was.

01:48:12.716 --> 01:48:14.208
I mean, I was amazed.

01:48:14.214 --> 01:48:15.818
There are so many cases like that

01:48:15.833 --> 01:48:17.388
but this is something remarkable.

01:48:17.413 --> 01:48:19.882
Where is Mexico! I was in Pune

01:48:19.973 --> 01:48:24.062
and just see how this Paramchaitanya has done it.

01:48:25.022 --> 01:48:27.272
How it is kind!

01:48:27.332 --> 01:48:31.690
It is the power of love of God which looks after you.

01:48:31.699 --> 01:48:33.429
After all the One who has created us,

01:48:33.419 --> 01:48:36.669
the Creator is going to look after us, isn’t it?

01:48:36.750 --> 01:48:44.328
But we should have also little attention towards finding out what is the truth.

01:48:44.335 --> 01:48:46.138
Don’t accept anything,

01:48:46.145 --> 01:48:48.628
you have to find out the truth first of all

01:48:48.645 --> 01:48:50.614
and everybody has said that

01:48:50.674 --> 01:48:53.209
it is the same thing as everybody has said,

01:48:53.225 --> 01:48:55.015
you should know about yourself.

01:48:56.054 --> 01:48:58.109
Guru Nanaka’s thing I will say:

01:48:58.109 --> 01:49:04.425
Kahe ray Ban khojan Jai, Sada Niwasi Sada Alepa, Tohey sang samai

01:49:04.437 --> 01:49:09.069
Pusp maday jo Bas Basat Hai, Mukur Mahey ras chayi

01:49:09.140 --> 01:49:13.895
Taisai hi Hari basay nirantar, Ghat hi khojo bhai

01:49:13.899 --> 01:49:18.355
Kahay nanak bin aapa chinay, Mitay na bhram ki kai’

01:49:18.395 --> 01:49:21.924
He said you must know yourself. “Know thyself” Christ has said.

01:49:22.015 --> 01:49:24.205
Everybody has said you should know yourself.

01:49:24.265 --> 01:49:26.185
Now what is that knowing yourself?

01:49:26.234 --> 01:49:30.191
That is nothing but you are

01:49:30.230 --> 01:49:33.241
the principle is that the truth is this

01:49:33.310 --> 01:49:37.157
that you are not this body, this mind,

01:49:37.167 --> 01:49:39.517
you are not these emotions,

01:49:39.517 --> 01:49:41.897
you are not this ego,

01:49:42.017 --> 01:49:46.310
you are not these conditionings but you are the pure Spirit.

01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:48.464
All our saints have said that.

01:49:48.484 --> 01:49:51.103
Now we are not on that path.

01:49:51.123 --> 01:49:54.431
We are not looking out for what are we.

01:49:54.433 --> 01:49:55.865
If we are the Spirit,

01:49:55.893 --> 01:49:58.875
then how are we to become the Spirit?

01:49:58.893 --> 01:50:01.175
Now anybody who starts talking like that,

01:50:01.216 --> 01:50:03.705
I mean, I was very much opposed by many people

01:50:03.756 --> 01:50:06.636
because they thought I was just telling lies,

01:50:06.625 --> 01:50:10.892
I am this thing, that thing, but when they got sick, they came to Me.

01:50:10.892 --> 01:50:12.504
That’s not the way.

01:50:12.504 --> 01:50:17.881
The way is to try to know that we do not know the absolute.

01:50:17.893 --> 01:50:20.250
Once you become a little humble about it

01:50:20.243 --> 01:50:22.060
that we don’t know the absolute,

01:50:22.105 --> 01:50:25.355
so the religion and science become one

01:50:25.355 --> 01:50:30.535
because you can explain it scientifically as Dr. U.C. Rai has done

01:50:30.558 --> 01:50:34.058
Scientifically, you can explain what happens.

01:50:34.047 --> 01:50:35.667
Now you don’t have to become

01:50:35.667 --> 01:50:38.940
what you call ‘karm-kandi’, ‘ritualistic’, no need

01:50:38.969 --> 01:50:41.710
There is nothing to be done ritualistically, nothing.

01:50:41.739 --> 01:50:43.701
Once you are really realised,

01:50:43.699 --> 01:50:46.359
you have to do a little meditation everyday,

01:50:46.370 --> 01:50:47.810
in the evening.

01:50:47.819 --> 01:50:53.556
Now what I also would I should say this Paramchaitanya

01:50:53.565 --> 01:50:57.214
that it gave us a chance to have a hospital in Vashi

01:50:57.216 --> 01:50:59.564
and the results are very good in Vashi.

01:50:59.596 --> 01:51:02.384
They never use to charge anything for the outdoor patients

01:51:02.384 --> 01:51:03.687
but they said, “Mother,

01:51:03.683 --> 01:51:05.277
please allow us to take ten Rupees.”

01:51:05.306 --> 01:51:08.406
I said, “All right, take ten Rupees, is all right for everything."

01:51:08.417 --> 01:51:11.906
but the people who are living inside,

01:51:11.926 --> 01:51:14.064
they are also paying little amount;

01:51:14.087 --> 01:51:16.920
nothing compared to what people pay in the hospitals.

01:51:16.933 --> 01:51:20.583
And Dr. Rai has so sacrificingly accepted.

01:51:20.603 --> 01:51:23.359
And the doctors are coming from Russia all the way.

01:51:23.388 --> 01:51:26.399
You know, Russian doctors are wonderful doctors.

01:51:26.419 --> 01:51:29.248
They are very great scientists, I must say.

01:51:29.319 --> 01:51:35.437
They have gone very far in scientific approach.

01:51:35.487 --> 01:51:38.161
They have tried to find out the energies,

01:51:38.198 --> 01:51:39.448
which are subtle energies,

01:51:39.457 --> 01:51:41.036
and lots of things they have done,

01:51:41.047 --> 01:51:42.897
but specially, they are very much interested

01:51:42.968 --> 01:51:47.725
in working through Sahaja Yoga and they are coming down here to work.

01:51:47.728 --> 01:51:52.015
Now I would not expect our doctors to come and work like that,

01:51:52.027 --> 01:51:54.515
but at least for once a week,

01:51:54.527 --> 01:51:56.205
they can give some time

01:51:56.227 --> 01:52:02.670
and they can practice Sahaja Yoga just as a blessing to the people.

01:52:02.672 --> 01:52:05.073
Our country is full of very poor people,

01:52:05.082 --> 01:52:08.002
very, very poor people, extremely poor

01:52:08.013 --> 01:52:10.402
and we feel very much concerned.

01:52:10.433 --> 01:52:11.610
People always ask Me,

01:52:11.614 --> 01:52:13.580
“Yours is such a Yoga Bhoomi

01:52:13.594 --> 01:52:15.424
then, the, why the people are poor?

01:52:15.453 --> 01:52:16.694
The poor they are,

01:52:16.703 --> 01:52:20.359
because they do not follow the right path.

01:52:20.353 --> 01:52:22.560
You see, if they follow the right path,

01:52:22.583 --> 01:52:25.042
Lakshmi is also there to bless you.

01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:26.902
There is nothing to worry about money,

01:52:26.919 --> 01:52:28.637
nothing to worry about anything

01:52:28.643 --> 01:52:34.487
and you become a person who is absolutely in balance.

01:52:34.493 --> 01:52:37.152
As soon as something comes up,

01:52:37.172 --> 01:52:38.603
some crisis come up,

01:52:38.611 --> 01:52:41.212
immediately you all become silent

01:52:41.283 --> 01:52:44.303
and you start seeing what’s wrong,

01:52:44.312 --> 01:52:45.683
what is the problem.

01:52:45.703 --> 01:52:47.613
Because you are not silent,

01:52:47.636 --> 01:52:48.763
always in the conflict,

01:52:48.776 --> 01:52:50.713
you cannot see the problem clearly

01:52:50.736 --> 01:52:52.713
and you cannot solve it,

01:52:52.716 --> 01:52:56.515
but, you actually, you don’t solve any problem.

01:52:56.536 --> 01:52:58.886
It is this, I must say this power.

01:52:58.955 --> 01:53:02.060
I also tell them I don’t do anything; I am just sitting down;

01:53:02.060 --> 01:53:03.405
this power is doing everything.

01:53:03.401 --> 01:53:04.555
They don’t believe it

01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:05.975
but it is a fact.

01:53:05.971 --> 01:53:07.675
I am not doing anything, I am just sitting,

01:53:07.690 --> 01:53:10.775
I am not planning, I am not doing anything whatsoever

01:53:10.786 --> 01:53:12.866
but this power does everything for us

01:53:12.915 --> 01:53:14.085
so why should I do it.

01:53:14.156 --> 01:53:18.397
But, it’s rather difficult for human beings to leave things to this power.

01:53:18.415 --> 01:53:21.877
Even some doctors, who have been practising Medical Science

01:53:21.895 --> 01:53:25.716
have had very funny experiences

01:53:25.727 --> 01:53:28.397
Like there’s one Dr. Amjad Ali in Australia

01:53:28.417 --> 01:53:30.354
who is very well qualified

01:53:30.348 --> 01:53:33.164
and he was experimenting

01:53:33.167 --> 01:53:36.598
on some sort of “kya kar rahe they.”

01:53:40.116 --> 01:53:42.558
So, you see that what he found

01:53:42.638 --> 01:53:46.699
when he went close to them, they start becoming smaller.

01:53:46.707 --> 01:53:47.879
He could not experiment.

01:53:47.884 --> 01:53:50.239
He said, “How my experiment will go?

01:53:50.274 --> 01:53:53.824
Because I cannot! As soon as I go near them, everything disappears,

01:53:53.824 --> 01:53:55.031
all the disease disappears,

01:53:55.054 --> 01:53:56.011
so what can I do?”

01:53:56.015 --> 01:53:58.111
I said, “You don’t experiment with that

01:53:58.120 --> 01:54:03.031
but you can experiment with the people who are already sick and do something about it.”

01:54:03.011 --> 01:54:04.500
So, there are many things like that.

01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:06.602
And another person told me that in England

01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:08.971
there is a craze for research.

01:54:09.011 --> 01:54:14.520
So, one scientist, they told him, “You find out what is minus 273,

01:54:14.580 --> 01:54:15.911
the absolute zero.

01:54:15.980 --> 01:54:21.278
So, he said, “I cannot, because the formula is such that some heat will remain always there.”

01:54:21.279 --> 01:54:22.298
I said, “All right,

01:54:22.295 --> 01:54:23.928
do one thing,

01:54:23.935 --> 01:54:27.495
you go and tell them this is absolute and how can we find absolute.”

01:54:27.511 --> 01:54:29.292
“We cannot find Absolute.

01:54:29.326 --> 01:54:32.683
It is absolutely, absolutely beyond us”.

01:54:32.692 --> 01:54:36.362
Then I said, “You use vibrations and you use these Divine vibrations.”

01:54:36.375 --> 01:54:39.428
And he achieved it. He got his doctorate and he did it.

01:54:39.435 --> 01:54:40.969
So, they asked him, “How did you do it?”

01:54:40.978 --> 01:54:42.759
He said, “I cannot explain to you.”

01:54:42.757 --> 01:54:44.129
“Because if I talk to them,

01:54:44.147 --> 01:54:45.448
they will never listen to me.

01:54:45.457 --> 01:54:47.830
These scientists, you know, they think no end of themselves.

01:54:47.848 --> 01:54:50.929
How can I tell them that I did it with this Divine Power?”

01:54:50.944 --> 01:54:53.547
They cannot believe that there is another big power

01:54:53.567 --> 01:54:55.446
After all who runs our heart?

01:54:55.466 --> 01:54:58.056
Ask the doctors who runs our heart.

01:54:58.076 --> 01:54:59.926
They will say Autonomous Nervous System.

01:54:59.957 --> 01:55:01.917
Now who is this Auto?

01:55:01.926 --> 01:55:03.464
Ask this question second one.

01:55:03.477 --> 01:55:04.554
You can’t answer.

01:55:04.569 --> 01:55:05.815
Who is this Auto?

01:55:05.821 --> 01:55:06.955
‘Auto’ you don’t know.

01:55:06.978 --> 01:55:09.728
They will just…

01:55:09.908 --> 01:55:13.768
But they are honest because they say, “We don’t know”

01:55:13.838 --> 01:55:16.548
and they have put it the name ‘Autonomous’.

01:55:16.649 --> 01:55:19.649
Now I am talking of parasympathetic nervous system,

01:55:24.729 --> 01:55:26.526
as you know very well.

01:55:26.539 --> 01:55:28.796
And we know very little about parasympathetic.

01:55:28.809 --> 01:55:29.835
It’s a fact.

01:55:29.865 --> 01:55:31.356
How for other people

01:55:31.363 --> 01:55:36.113
I will tell you that in very simple words what is parasympathetic.

01:55:36.133 --> 01:55:38.522
Now when there is some emergency,

01:55:38.512 --> 01:55:42.044
our sympathetic nervous system which is to the left and right side

01:55:42.044 --> 01:55:44.347
go into motion.

01:55:44.345 --> 01:55:45.818
Like, we have to run,

01:55:45.814 --> 01:55:50.568
then if you are running, our heart will start pumping blood.

01:55:50.584 --> 01:55:53.928
But what brings it back to normal,

01:55:53.943 --> 01:55:56.584
is the parasympathetic, in simple words.

01:56:00.454 --> 01:56:03.667
So, this parasympathetic nervous system,

01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:05.878
when it is filled with energy,

01:56:05.861 --> 01:56:09.408
when it is filled with energy it just settles down.

01:56:09.421 --> 01:56:11.097
It gets nourished

01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:14.747
and then it starts working in such a beautiful manner

01:56:14.771 --> 01:56:19.568
that you achieve so many things which you could not normally achieve.

01:56:19.579 --> 01:56:24.160
First thing that happens that you become a very peaceful personality,

01:56:25.729 --> 01:56:27.899
very peaceful.

01:56:27.919 --> 01:56:30.071
Because we are thinking,

01:56:30.075 --> 01:56:34.082
now the thoughts are rising and falling, again thoughts are rising and falling,

01:56:34.104 --> 01:56:36.222
again thoughts are rising and falling.

01:56:36.245 --> 01:56:40.131
All the time we are jumping on the cusp of the thoughts.

01:56:40.151 --> 01:56:43.392
But there is a space in between

01:56:43.432 --> 01:56:45.861
and that is in Sanskrit called ‘vilambha’.

01:56:45.921 --> 01:56:49.387
But we can call it ‘pause’ in English language.

01:56:49.396 --> 01:56:52.437
Now this is the time

01:56:52.455 --> 01:56:55.666
where we never see that point.

01:56:55.675 --> 01:56:57.077
We never are there.

01:56:57.086 --> 01:56:58.546
So, when we are jumping,

01:56:58.566 --> 01:57:01.332
we are jumping in the future or in the past

01:57:01.329 --> 01:57:03.618
For example, just now, you are sitting before Me,

01:57:03.608 --> 01:57:06.028
maybe you are thinking if they will get a train or not,

01:57:06.039 --> 01:57:08.178
a bus or not, this and that,

01:57:08.238 --> 01:57:10.649
or maybe you are thinking about your past.

01:57:10.698 --> 01:57:13.321
But you cannot be in the centre.

01:57:13.349 --> 01:57:14.872
This is the big problem.

01:57:14.892 --> 01:57:18.711
You cannot be in the present.

01:57:18.722 --> 01:57:21.662
If I say, “Be in the present”, you cannot.

01:57:21.682 --> 01:57:24.122
And in the present is reality.

01:57:24.142 --> 01:57:28.481
In the present is totality and in the present is silence.

01:57:28.481 --> 01:57:30.071
You don’t think.

01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:33.466
So, according to even to Patanjali

01:57:33.461 --> 01:57:35.966
you have to become Nirvichar.

01:57:35.975 --> 01:57:38.417
These thoughts which are bombarding your head,

01:57:38.407 --> 01:57:41.097
you have to become in charge of them,

01:57:41.167 --> 01:57:43.167
you have to be in control with them.

01:57:43.157 --> 01:57:45.653
So, what happens? You become Nirvichar,

01:57:45.657 --> 01:57:46.943
without any thoughts.

01:57:46.977 --> 01:57:48.412
It’s a thoughtless awareness.

01:57:48.410 --> 01:57:51.343
And this thoughtless awareness

01:57:51.361 --> 01:57:55.943
is the one that gives you complete peace within yourself.

01:57:55.950 --> 01:57:57.874
People talk of peace, other.

01:57:57.881 --> 01:58:00.200
I know of people who have got peace awards,

01:58:00.193 --> 01:58:03.206
big, big, such hot-tempered people

01:58:03.216 --> 01:58:06.789
that you have to approach them with a barge pole.

01:58:06.798 --> 01:58:10.399
I don’t know from what angle they are talking about peace

01:58:10.430 --> 01:58:12.541
but they have got peace awards.

01:58:12.561 --> 01:58:16.173
Big, big people like that I have known who have got peace awards.

01:58:16.180 --> 01:58:18.541
Peace has to come within.

01:58:18.566 --> 01:58:20.986
When human beings become peaceful,

01:58:20.990 --> 01:58:22.280
there won’t be any quarrels,

01:58:22.321 --> 01:58:26.515
no fights, no wars and no politics.

01:58:26.532 --> 01:58:28.042
If you are peaceful,

01:58:28.111 --> 01:58:30.575
then you are so satisfied,

01:58:30.602 --> 01:58:34.975
you're as in Hindi, they say, “Apney me hi sama jatey hai,”

01:58:34.961 --> 01:58:37.254
you are satisfied with yourself.

01:58:37.256 --> 01:58:41.222
You don’t get into the mad rush

01:58:41.265 --> 01:58:46.483
of approaching somebody, encroaching somebody,

01:58:46.521 --> 01:58:48.640
aggressing on someone;

01:58:48.651 --> 01:58:52.341
no, you are with yourself in complete peace.

01:58:52.361 --> 01:58:55.530
As a result, so many things happen.

01:58:55.580 --> 01:58:58.704
Maybe I am the oldest person living here.

01:58:58.693 --> 01:59:02.133
Nobody can be more in age

01:59:02.182 --> 01:59:04.499
because I am seventy-four now. I will be seventy-five.

01:59:04.522 --> 01:59:05.760
So, you can imagine.

01:59:05.783 --> 01:59:11.394
But at peace when you are, you are not having any such ideas of aggression,

01:59:11.414 --> 01:59:12.954
aggression or anything.

01:59:12.954 --> 01:59:15.535
You become absolutely peaceful

01:59:15.553 --> 01:59:18.658
and this peace is very required today

01:59:18.664 --> 01:59:21.193
for this world to come to something

01:59:21.225 --> 01:59:24.028
which we call as a peaceful world.

01:59:24.044 --> 01:59:27.198
By fighting, by quarrelling you can never achieve peace.

01:59:27.213 --> 01:59:29.943
I have seen people going with the flags,

01:59:30.012 --> 01:59:33.504
now fight for peace and fight for this, no need.

01:59:33.483 --> 01:59:37.285
If you become peaceful everything works out so well

01:59:37.292 --> 01:59:40.986
and this Paramchaitanya is with you to help you.

01:59:41.010 --> 01:59:43.256
There is no need to fight anybody,

01:59:43.271 --> 01:59:46.535
to aggress anybody or to trouble anybody

01:59:46.561 --> 01:59:49.586
This is very important for doctors

01:59:49.595 --> 01:59:52.327
and for also business people

01:59:52.336 --> 01:59:54.146
Now the problem of business people

01:59:54.146 --> 01:59:56.526
because they told me there are some business people also

01:59:56.557 --> 01:59:59.876
is their stress which is a common disease.

02:00:01.318 --> 02:00:04.160
They are the same, very futuristic, you know,

02:00:04.178 --> 02:00:07.343
all the time calculating, very, very futuristic.

02:00:07.339 --> 02:00:09.593
And in America, a new disease has developed,

02:00:09.609 --> 02:00:11.689
they call it ‘yuppies disease'

02:00:25.174 --> 02:00:27.874
That disease is such a horrible thing it is,

02:00:27.955 --> 02:00:31.423
it is that your rational mind just goes out,

02:00:31.444 --> 02:00:33.644
your conscious mind just goes out,

02:00:33.665 --> 02:00:35.544
you can’t even lift your hand,

02:00:35.555 --> 02:00:37.883
you can’t even lift your fingers

02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:42.627
and people carry you just like what you can call a

02:00:42.629 --> 02:00:44.278
reptile on your body.

02:00:44.289 --> 02:00:46.247
You can think all right,

02:00:46.271 --> 02:00:51.470
you can talk all right,

02:00:51.560 --> 02:00:53.118
you can plan all right,

02:00:53.131 --> 02:00:54.778
calculate all right

02:00:54.778 --> 02:00:55.857
but you cannot walk,

02:00:55.838 --> 02:00:57.077
you cannot lift your hand,

02:00:57.088 --> 02:00:58.948
you cannot do anything.

02:00:58.968 --> 02:01:01.807
This is a new disease that has come in America

02:01:01.818 --> 02:01:06.231
and is spreading all over and I have seen one patient also here.

02:01:06.251 --> 02:01:10.580
So, what I am trying to say that going with this your stress,

02:01:10.582 --> 02:01:12.970
all kind of things can happen.

02:01:13.001 --> 02:01:16.675
Now why this stress is there, that also we should know.

02:01:17.562 --> 02:01:18.999
First of all,

02:01:18.990 --> 02:01:22.198
the Kundalini has started working in this Kali Yuga

02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:23.448
in these times.

02:01:23.450 --> 02:01:25.857
Secondly, if you see these two centres,

02:01:25.874 --> 02:01:28.354
two Nadis or two channels,

02:01:28.405 --> 02:01:30.185
we call Ida and Pingala Nadi.

02:01:30.194 --> 02:01:34.490
So, the Pingala Nadi creates Ego within us,

02:01:34.515 --> 02:01:36.310
as it is shown there,

02:01:36.314 --> 02:01:37.470
you see, the yellow one.

02:01:37.473 --> 02:01:41.551
It creates a balloon like.

02:01:41.566 --> 02:01:44.892
Then the second one is the Ida Nadi

02:01:44.926 --> 02:01:48.281
which also creates a balloon.

02:01:48.303 --> 02:01:51.499
Now Ida [Pingala] Nadi creates the ego balloon

02:01:51.522 --> 02:01:56.260
and the left side one creates the superego, means conditionings

02:01:56.283 --> 02:01:58.180
Now if you are identified with something,

02:01:58.187 --> 02:02:00.109
if you are conditioned within you with something,

02:02:00.127 --> 02:02:02.098
then these two are there.

02:02:02.158 --> 02:02:04.352
But when you are too much right sided,

02:02:04.388 --> 02:02:08.995
these are all – you see the ego moves and covers the left side.

02:02:08.995 --> 02:02:11.365
So, there is a blockage, complete blockage.

02:02:11.424 --> 02:02:13.825
Now whatever problems you have

02:02:13.885 --> 02:02:16.381
they cannot pass out of your body.

02:02:16.388 --> 02:02:18.671
That makes you weaker and weaker

02:02:18.678 --> 02:02:21.611
and that’s how you have stress.

02:02:21.638 --> 02:02:23.202
With this Kundalini,

02:02:23.220 --> 02:02:25.341
these two move out like that

02:02:25.399 --> 02:02:30.100
and is opened out and you become one with this Divine Power.

02:02:30.129 --> 02:02:34.223
Now as far as the brain is, for there are some neurosurgeons also,

02:02:34.249 --> 02:02:36.392
as far as the brain is concerned,

02:02:36.452 --> 02:02:39.213
we know that we use wee part of our brain,

02:02:39.223 --> 02:02:41.162
very little part of our brain.

02:02:41.162 --> 02:02:44.981
But once you get this Kundalini then it enlightens

02:02:44.992 --> 02:02:50.222
so many areas of your head that you just know

02:02:50.292 --> 02:02:52.452
Sometimes people ask Me, “Mother, how do you know?”

02:02:52.492 --> 02:02:55.252
“I know. I don’t know how I know.”

02:02:55.263 --> 02:02:56.903
There is no technique for it.

02:02:56.903 --> 02:02:58.073
Just I know.

02:02:58.093 --> 02:02:59.832
They say, “Mother, how do you know this thing?

02:02:59.854 --> 02:03:00.872
How do you know?”

02:03:00.883 --> 02:03:02.182
Somebody wrote me a letter

02:03:02.203 --> 02:03:04.522
and I said, “Who has written this letter, I know.”

02:03:04.533 --> 02:03:05.921
And I told them,

02:03:05.921 --> 02:03:07.392
they said, “Mother, how do you know?”

02:03:07.421 --> 02:03:10.682
I said, “I know for definite this is the one who has written.”

02:03:10.682 --> 02:03:12.511
I don’t know that person. I have never seen him.

02:03:12.511 --> 02:03:14.450
I've never seen his hand writing

02:03:14.531 --> 02:03:16.671
but I said, “I know who has written this letter.”

02:03:16.667 --> 02:03:18.031
Just I know.

02:03:18.037 --> 02:03:21.354
But I wouldn’t say that it’s something great

02:03:21.364 --> 02:03:25.744
that I should know because I just know without any work,

02:03:25.958 --> 02:03:28.422
without any thinking,

02:03:28.463 --> 02:03:32.664
without any managing. Just automatically I know everything.

02:03:32.813 --> 02:03:36.353
So, once you become that, you don’t have to worry.

02:03:36.527 --> 02:03:41.428
Now, for example, I know, also, a lady doctor in Delhi,

02:03:41.467 --> 02:03:43.096
no in Bombay.

02:03:43.107 --> 02:03:45.906
She is the one who is a surgeon.

02:03:45.908 --> 02:03:52.263
She said, “Mother I could know that this man has tumour,

02:03:52.263 --> 02:03:56.263
very much low in his brains but it will come out.”

02:03:56.274 --> 02:04:00.013
So, she said, “Then I was just giving vibrations first.

02:04:00.027 --> 02:04:02.670
I said let me try first the vibrations on that.”

02:04:02.667 --> 02:04:05.270
They said, “No, No, there is no tumour on that side.”

02:04:05.288 --> 02:04:08.100
She said, “It is here. I know I can feel it; it is here.”

02:04:08.098 --> 02:04:10.429
They wouldn’t, they started arguing with her

02:04:10.457 --> 02:04:12.975
and then they found out the tumour where she said,

02:04:12.987 --> 02:04:14.364
exactly there.

02:04:14.377 --> 02:04:15.705
They said, “How do you know?”

02:04:15.726 --> 02:04:17.933
She said, “I don’t know how do I know.”

02:04:17.957 --> 02:04:21.085
So even the children can tell where is the problem,

02:04:21.087 --> 02:04:25.415
in your head, in your brain, what is happening.

02:04:25.415 --> 02:04:30.766
Now to look after your brain is very important that you don’t go into imbalances

02:04:30.757 --> 02:04:32.527
because if you go into imbalance,

02:04:32.576 --> 02:04:36.261
your right side will develop or your left side will develop.

02:04:36.279 --> 02:04:39.204
Actually, the right side develops on the left

02:04:39.319 --> 02:04:41.934
and the left side develops on the right.

02:04:42.224 --> 02:04:45.635
Now also I don’t know how far the medical science has gone

02:04:45.684 --> 02:04:49.575
up to the understanding as to left and right side

02:04:49.635 --> 02:04:53.401
are two different complementary systems.

02:04:53.456 --> 02:04:56.267
I don’t know if that they accept, do they?

02:04:59.249 --> 02:05:05.012
But in Sahaja Yoga you will discover that there are two complementary systems.

02:05:07.242 --> 02:05:10.086
One is right sided; one is left sided.

02:05:10.102 --> 02:05:14.226
And when the right side is too much then the left side might act

02:05:14.226 --> 02:05:17.526
or when the left side is too much, then right side may act.

02:05:17.535 --> 02:05:20.126
You see it’s a complimentary two systems

02:05:20.195 --> 02:05:22.814
and if you go on one system all the time

02:05:22.863 --> 02:05:26.064
then you become right sided or left sided.

02:05:26.073 --> 02:05:28.874
Now left sided are the people who are not futuristic

02:05:28.883 --> 02:05:32.403
but who are the people who live in the past.

02:05:32.412 --> 02:05:36.003
Now of course I don’t want to, just now, discuss about it very much

02:05:36.026 --> 02:05:40.829
because it’s also more confusing for people.

02:05:40.836 --> 02:05:42.488
Because they don’t want to believe

02:05:42.506 --> 02:05:44.885
that there is something like dead souls

02:05:44.925 --> 02:05:51.479
or they don’t want to believe in the viruses being dead vegetables

02:05:51.483 --> 02:05:54.731
and things like that but it is.

02:05:54.744 --> 02:05:56.180
On the left-hand side,

02:05:56.171 --> 02:05:59.430
we have got all our past since our creation.

02:05:59.430 --> 02:06:01.842
So, if somebody gets virus you give antibiotics,

02:06:01.856 --> 02:06:04.861
you do what you like, it won’t go.

02:06:04.885 --> 02:06:07.537
Only Sahaja Yoga can drive it out.

02:06:07.537 --> 02:06:10.702
Only through Sahaja Yoga you can cure viruses

02:06:10.717 --> 02:06:13.626
because only Sahaja Yoga can act on the left side.

02:06:13.637 --> 02:06:18.796
Many mad people, crazy people have been cured through Sahaja Yoga.

02:06:18.807 --> 02:06:24.820
Also, it gives you a good idea about

02:06:24.816 --> 02:06:27.881
how you can show people,

02:06:27.890 --> 02:06:30.459
who is mad and who is not mad.

02:06:30.461 --> 02:06:33.530
Like I had a program in Pune in the beginning

02:06:33.530 --> 02:06:39.910
and they arranged it in a hall which was owned by some Brahmins.

02:06:39.943 --> 02:06:43.197
So, when I went there, they said, “No, no, She is not a Brahmin

02:06:43.182 --> 02:06:44.847
so we can’t give Her the hall.

02:06:44.858 --> 02:06:46.706
So, Sahaja Yogis were mischievous,

02:06:46.738 --> 02:06:49.956
they said, “All right, we will give it in the newspaper that they are refusing

02:06:49.968 --> 02:06:51.456
because She is not a Brahmin.”

02:06:51.459 --> 02:06:54.175
“No, no, don’t do like that we will have it.”

02:06:54.198 --> 02:06:56.956
So, I didn’t know what was happening behind the back.

02:06:57.015 --> 02:06:58.776
When I went there, I was sitting there.

02:06:58.785 --> 02:07:03.240
Very interesting I saw about twenty-five people sitting in front of me shaking

02:07:03.229 --> 02:07:04.809
like this

02:07:04.820 --> 02:07:05.965
“Mother, stop it, stop it

02:07:05.979 --> 02:07:07.360
we know Your powers, stop it.”

02:07:07.360 --> 02:07:09.130
I said, “I am not doing anything, you are….”

02:07:09.149 --> 02:07:12.997
They said, “Now, also there are people who are shaking like this.”

02:07:12.990 --> 02:07:15.427
So, I said, “Ask them, who they are?”

02:07:15.443 --> 02:07:19.706
They said, “We are certified mad from Thana.

02:07:19.713 --> 02:07:22.073
We have come here with our superintendent

02:07:22.093 --> 02:07:24.637
because You had cured one mad man.”

02:07:24.646 --> 02:07:28.097
“So”, they said, “Are we also mad?” “Yes, there is something wrong.”

02:07:28.115 --> 02:07:29.686
So, the thing was

02:07:29.706 --> 02:07:32.965
they were thinking the Brahmins are the highest or something like that.

02:07:32.995 --> 02:07:35.349
Is all nonsensical ideas

02:07:35.378 --> 02:07:38.157
because Brahmin is that which knows the Brahma,

02:07:38.178 --> 02:07:40.856
which knows All Pervading Power.

02:07:40.878 --> 02:07:44.709
And because of these funny ideas, they have tortured all the saints.

02:07:44.769 --> 02:07:47.227
Specially in Maharashtra

02:07:47.227 --> 02:07:51.146
people have tortured all the saints all the time.

02:07:51.171 --> 02:07:54.390
So, where you have so many saints

02:07:54.441 --> 02:07:55.603
and so many people

02:07:55.613 --> 02:07:59.048
then you must know that it was just to work out

02:07:59.066 --> 02:08:02.418
the brains of these close-minded people.

02:08:02.445 --> 02:08:07.666
But to open them out is only possible I think when they are in difficulties.

02:08:07.726 --> 02:08:10.662
When they are not in difficulties they don’t want to accept.

02:08:10.675 --> 02:08:13.671
Supposing they are sick then they will come to Me.

02:08:13.684 --> 02:08:17.300
Now if you cure somebody sick, you see once he is cured, he is finished.

02:08:17.305 --> 02:08:21.125
He doesn’t do any Sahaja Yoga; he doesn’t want to help anyone.

02:08:21.195 --> 02:08:25.355
But if there is a person who is healthy,

02:08:25.386 --> 02:08:27.690
who is perfectly all right

02:08:27.686 --> 02:08:30.141
and who is knowledgeable,

02:08:30.136 --> 02:08:32.581
if he comes to Sahaja Yoga, he will be such a help

02:08:32.581 --> 02:08:37.083
to this, I should say, to this poor country.

02:08:37.090 --> 02:08:40.382
This country is suffering from tremendous poverty.

02:08:40.400 --> 02:08:42.246
Now only saying,

02:08:42.275 --> 02:08:45.666
“Garibi Hatao, Garibi Hatao, Garibi Hatao” (“Eliminate poverty!”)

02:08:45.657 --> 02:08:49.056
I know of one gentleman who was a great corrupt fellow

02:08:49.076 --> 02:08:52.532
and who used to live in one room with a little cot.

02:08:52.552 --> 02:08:54.384
I said, “Why do you live like this?”

02:08:54.402 --> 02:08:57.324
He said, “Because, everybody is garib [poor] so I want to live like garib.”

02:08:57.333 --> 02:08:59.554
I said, “Why don’t you give all this money to these garibs?

02:08:59.572 --> 02:09:01.413
Why are you lying like this?”

02:09:01.433 --> 02:09:04.052
He said, “All right, you suggest to me any organisation

02:09:04.123 --> 02:09:08.433
which is absolutely above board and I will move.”

02:09:08.433 --> 02:09:11.090
That was a difficult thing, a decision.

02:09:11.092 --> 02:09:12.349
But what I am trying to say

02:09:12.382 --> 02:09:14.791
only by saying people are garib, garib,

02:09:14.851 --> 02:09:17.181
you have to attend to that

02:09:17.191 --> 02:09:19.923
and is only possible through Sahaja Yoga.

02:09:19.923 --> 02:09:20.822
How?

02:09:20.828 --> 02:09:25.387
Sahaja Yoga is practiced mostly by middle class.

02:09:25.407 --> 02:09:29.777
Both the sides are – one side are the poor, another side are the rich.

02:09:29.848 --> 02:09:33.157
Rich are very few. But more by the middle class.

02:09:33.170 --> 02:09:37.047
Then it’s like a river which expands on both the sides

02:09:37.067 --> 02:09:41.594
This time I was, I mean, I have been always thinking that

02:09:41.596 --> 02:09:44.407
I have to do something for the poor people,

02:09:44.434 --> 02:09:47.826
something, always and I have done also, on my own,

02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:50.996
but I wanted Sahaja Yogis to contribute, Indian Sahaja Yogis.

02:09:50.991 --> 02:09:53.645
So, I told them I want to start a place

02:09:53.641 --> 02:09:57.380
where we could have these women

02:09:57.375 --> 02:10:01.465
who are standing on the roads with their children asking for alms.

02:10:01.509 --> 02:10:04.316
We can have something to help them.

02:10:04.336 --> 02:10:07.520
Immediately, I was surprised Sahaja Yogis contributed to me

02:10:07.549 --> 02:10:11.739
for that and I was so amazed at their enthusiasm.

02:10:11.762 --> 02:10:14.000
I said, “This is the generosity.

02:10:14.544 --> 02:10:17.750
This generosity that has come to Sahaja Yogis.”

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:22.580
And then when they said, “Mother this is we have got all this through Sahaja Yoga

02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:26.660
We have improved so much that we don’t have to worry.”

02:10:26.694 --> 02:10:31.013
And they so generously, I mean a person becomes extremely generous.

02:10:31.033 --> 02:10:33.093
He becomes very peaceful;

02:10:33.114 --> 02:10:37.464
he becomes generous and he starts enjoying the generosity.

02:10:37.468 --> 02:10:39.964
I mean people earn such a lot of money.

02:10:39.959 --> 02:10:42.618
Everything they should do there is no harm.

02:10:42.689 --> 02:10:45.388
In Sahaja Yoga, there is nothing like sanyasa.

02:10:45.448 --> 02:10:47.192
Nobody has to take sanyas.

02:10:47.178 --> 02:10:49.953
Nobody has to go out of his family,

02:10:49.982 --> 02:10:54.924
out of his … nothing. It’s all here. Why to go anywhere?

02:10:54.924 --> 02:10:58.390
So, you have to be a very normal person.

02:10:58.439 --> 02:11:00.739
But one thing is important,

02:11:00.790 --> 02:11:05.623
you must have the pure desire to get your Realisation.

02:11:05.642 --> 02:11:09.681
If you don’t have that pure Realisation then it doesn’t work out.

02:11:09.692 --> 02:11:11.524
Apart from that it might work

02:11:11.542 --> 02:11:13.163
but you go on dropping down

02:11:13.174 --> 02:11:15.736
because if you want to make money out of Sahaja Yoga

02:11:15.725 --> 02:11:19.926
or if you want to, say, achieve some power out of it.

02:11:19.924 --> 02:11:21.232
You see, you are so powerful

02:11:21.254 --> 02:11:24.497
that you don’t have to ask for power or anything.

02:11:24.522 --> 02:11:28.047
You don’t know how it works and how it gives.

02:11:28.053 --> 02:11:30.837
First of all, only we have to believe

02:11:30.837 --> 02:11:36.058
that we are reflections of God Almighty.

02:11:36.078 --> 02:11:38.618
We're not just human beings.

02:11:38.627 --> 02:11:42.109
Specially, to be born in India

02:11:42.118 --> 02:11:44.091
you must have done lots of punyas,

02:11:44.118 --> 02:11:48.459
otherwise you cannot be born in this great country I can tell you.

02:11:48.489 --> 02:11:52.138
All this, you see, is all nonsense that is going on,

02:11:52.149 --> 02:11:55.707
is just skirmishes on the periphery,

02:11:55.730 --> 02:11:59.719
but if you see the culture,

02:11:59.770 --> 02:12:03.011
the love, affection we have,

02:12:03.024 --> 02:12:06.301
the understanding of value system we have,

02:12:06.305 --> 02:12:07.571
you can’t imagine it.

02:12:07.596 --> 02:12:09.620
When you go abroad, you are amazed.

02:12:09.636 --> 02:12:12.540
you don’t know how to tell them.

02:12:12.555 --> 02:12:13.870
They're so stupid,

02:12:13.940 --> 02:12:17.821
I tell you, very stupid people, nothing to learn from them.

02:12:17.881 --> 02:12:22.770
I have been fighting with the stupidity of people specially Americans.

02:12:22.830 --> 02:12:27.496
I'm surprised, I think that they are not yet grown up as human beings.

02:12:27.695 --> 02:12:30.496
The way they talk, the way they understand.

02:12:30.536 --> 02:12:34.219
They only like people who will come and tell them stories

02:12:34.245 --> 02:12:36.975
and make fool out of them, make lot of money.

02:12:37.026 --> 02:12:39.298
To me they said, “We cannot take to Sahaja Yoga.”

02:12:39.277 --> 02:12:40.318
I said, “Why?”

02:12:40.306 --> 02:12:41.594
“Because you don’t take money,

02:12:41.607 --> 02:12:43.346
what is your validity?

02:12:43.357 --> 02:12:45.886
If you don’t take money then you have no validity,

02:12:45.946 --> 02:12:48.684
why should we believe in you because …”

02:12:48.687 --> 02:12:53.287
I said, “Supposing I take money, then?” “Then we can prosecute you.”

02:12:53.327 --> 02:12:56.537
I said, “Go and prosecute all these people who have looted you”.

02:12:56.647 --> 02:12:58.753
Nobody could prosecute them.

02:12:58.767 --> 02:13:04.439
So, this is we should not look to them for understanding of life.

02:13:04.443 --> 02:13:05.838
They have not yet understood.

02:13:05.828 --> 02:13:07.969
We have to look to ourselves.

02:13:07.994 --> 02:13:10.060
We have such a heritage.

02:13:10.104 --> 02:13:12.229
You can imagine, thousands of years back,

02:13:12.223 --> 02:13:14.263
we have been talking of Brahma,

02:13:14.314 --> 02:13:19.638
we have been talking of absolute truth.

02:13:19.658 --> 02:13:22.938
In what country they have this kind of knowledge.

02:13:22.938 --> 02:13:23.925
No country.

02:13:23.928 --> 02:13:28.292
So, first of all we should be very proud to be an Indian.

02:13:28.309 --> 02:13:29.731
That’s very important.

02:13:29.742 --> 02:13:32.481
Even Sahaja Yogis from abroad they dress up like Indians

02:13:32.522 --> 02:13:34.611
and they have taken to our culture,

02:13:34.611 --> 02:13:36.298
our style of culture.

02:13:36.287 --> 02:13:38.653
I need not tell you about the Western Culture

02:13:38.713 --> 02:13:41.327
as I was really shocked.

02:13:41.334 --> 02:13:44.988
Then I thought I better write down something about them

02:13:45.098 --> 02:13:46.859
as a witness whatever I saw.

02:13:46.857 --> 02:13:49.238
So, there is nothing to learn from them,

02:13:49.308 --> 02:13:53.247
but one day will come, they have to come here.

02:13:53.257 --> 02:13:55.716
All the doctors have to come here.

02:13:55.745 --> 02:13:59.796
I am very thankful, very, very thankful

02:13:59.805 --> 02:14:03.566
to this Indian Medical Association especially.

02:14:03.613 --> 02:14:09.276
I never expected and I am very grateful to them for this

02:14:09.279 --> 02:14:13.326
because I know in this country if the doctors take it up,

02:14:13.346 --> 02:14:16.931
all over the world they will have to understand

02:14:23.019 --> 02:14:29.812
the value of our knowledge of life and of Medical Science.

02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:34.831
I would say that I have seen so many people sitting here

02:14:34.871 --> 02:14:36.232
I don’t know how many are doctors,

02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:39.922
how many are from industries and how many are Sahaja Yogis.

02:14:39.918 --> 02:14:43.432
Whatever it is, one has to know that all of us

02:14:43.445 --> 02:14:47.056
are blessed by the same reflection of God Almighty

02:14:47.115 --> 02:14:50.428
within ourselves which we should experience.

02:14:50.868 --> 02:14:54.334
After that you will tell me what has happened to you,

02:14:54.338 --> 02:14:57.464
what you have felt and what you had.

02:14:57.479 --> 02:15:01.274
It’s a thing, is a matter of your right to have it.

02:15:01.281 --> 02:15:03.904
It’s your right to have that power

02:15:03.915 --> 02:15:06.816
but you have to ask for it.

02:15:06.876 --> 02:15:09.595
If you don’t ask for it, I cannot force it on you.

02:15:09.646 --> 02:15:11.595
Nobody can force it on you.

02:15:11.655 --> 02:15:13.597
It is a very spontaneous happening

02:15:13.676 --> 02:15:18.486
and it works out, so fast, so fast.

02:15:18.486 --> 02:15:20.539
I must tell you in Russia,

02:15:20.546 --> 02:15:23.256
this hall of course has fallen short

02:15:23.316 --> 02:15:28.644
but in Russia you always have it in big-big huge places

02:15:28.653 --> 02:15:31.653
with sixteen thousand, eighteen thousand

02:15:31.734 --> 02:15:35.323
and they are so much

02:15:35.403 --> 02:15:38.010
I don’t know, endowed with shraddha,

02:15:38.001 --> 02:15:41.160
so much that in the program only they get it.

02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:44.780
Only in the program! I could not understand.

02:15:44.790 --> 02:15:47.551
And they had a meeting of the scientists there,

02:15:47.571 --> 02:15:50.299
about two hundred and fifty scientists came.

02:15:50.319 --> 02:15:53.100
So, I started telling them about science to begin with.

02:15:53.169 --> 02:15:56.419
I said better be on their level at least to talk to them.

02:15:56.439 --> 02:15:59.448
So, one of them got up and said,

02:15:59.464 --> 02:16:02.439
“Mother, don’t tell us about this science, we know everything.

02:16:02.459 --> 02:16:04.919
Now, you tell us the science of God,

02:16:04.899 --> 02:16:05.839
science of Divine.

02:16:05.841 --> 02:16:07.048
You tell us about this.”

02:16:07.051 --> 02:16:09.790
I was amazed, look at these Russians!

02:16:09.870 --> 02:16:12.410
So, I found out all these countries

02:16:12.421 --> 02:16:16.706
like Bulgaria, Russia, Romania and all these five countries,

02:16:16.711 --> 02:16:19.706
there the people are like clean slates,

02:16:19.694 --> 02:16:21.504
they have no conditioning,

02:16:21.575 --> 02:16:23.015
they don’t know anything about God,

02:16:23.075 --> 02:16:25.955
they don’t know anything about books, nothing.

02:16:26.004 --> 02:16:27.885
Absolutely, they are not conditioned

02:16:27.874 --> 02:16:30.195
and the way they have achieved this Sahaja Yoga

02:16:30.178 --> 02:16:32.336
I have been really amazed at this.

02:16:32.397 --> 02:16:36.809
Romania I was amazed and I just told them,

02:16:36.827 --> 02:16:41.669
one paper I read – not read, I never read – I told them about one thing

02:16:41.689 --> 02:16:45.156
and the medical, same thing like this, was there

02:16:45.176 --> 02:16:47.626
and they gave me a Doctorate,

02:16:47.647 --> 02:16:51.327
not honorary but real Doctorate, on that knowledge.

02:16:51.323 --> 02:16:52.336
Can you imagine?

02:16:52.312 --> 02:16:54.687
I mean it’s not possible.

02:16:54.702 --> 02:16:57.358
First, I didn’t know, I have never known these things,

02:16:57.352 --> 02:17:00.278
so one of my disciples, “Mother, you have become a Doctor!”

02:17:00.283 --> 02:17:02.687
I said, “That I think I have, already.”

02:17:02.705 --> 02:17:05.126
“No, no this is a real Doctorate, real.”

02:17:05.176 --> 02:17:07.363
I said, “Really, how they have done?”

02:17:07.365 --> 02:17:09.024
Such sensitive people

02:17:09.024 --> 02:17:11.303
but this sensitivity comes

02:17:11.305 --> 02:17:15.113
perhaps may be that they were very much oppressed and troubled

02:17:15.142 --> 02:17:19.564
and also, they had no conditioning of anything.

02:17:19.551 --> 02:17:23.635
And it’s very surprising they have no sense of possessiveness.

02:17:23.647 --> 02:17:27.807
Their Government said, “You take your own flats and look after.”

02:17:27.847 --> 02:17:31.527
So, they said, “No, no, no we don’t want. You look after.”

02:17:31.538 --> 02:17:33.958
They said, “All right whatever cars you have given, you take them.”

02:17:34.027 --> 02:17:36.620
“No, no, no, no. What a headache. You better look after.

02:17:36.639 --> 02:17:38.485
What is the use of taking them?

02:17:38.534 --> 02:17:41.860
Because after all when we die it will be left here.”

02:17:41.894 --> 02:17:44.350
So, such unconditioned minds

02:17:44.380 --> 02:17:46.450
and such clean slates I tell you!

02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:49.643
In the same way we are also very much,

02:17:49.639 --> 02:17:53.779
Indians are very much capable,

02:17:53.817 --> 02:17:57.041
very much more capable than they are.

02:17:57.531 --> 02:17:59.031
Once they get it, they get it

02:17:59.101 --> 02:18:01.330
and they can go very deep into it

02:18:01.351 --> 02:18:03.920
because our life is very deep.

02:18:03.940 --> 02:18:07.080
Our, culture is very deep.

02:18:07.170 --> 02:18:10.460
We have had thanks to all the Saints and all the Sufis

02:18:10.520 --> 02:18:18.600
and all the incarnations that basically our genes are very good.

02:18:18.621 --> 02:18:22.200
But with Sahaja Yoga you can even change the genes,

02:18:22.210 --> 02:18:23.560
we have shown you.

02:18:23.590 --> 02:18:26.999
You can change the genes also in Sahaja Yoga.

02:18:26.999 --> 02:18:30.159
And we should not accept anybody because he says,

02:18:30.219 --> 02:18:34.393
“His genes are bad, so he should be allowed to be what he is.”

02:18:34.464 --> 02:18:35.683
It’s not that.

02:18:35.754 --> 02:18:39.663
Everything changeable and to say that genes are

02:18:39.734 --> 02:18:43.889
just the cause of your own style,

02:18:43.886 --> 02:18:45.270
it’s not so.

02:18:45.275 --> 02:18:48.179
Because one child will have different genes,

02:18:48.199 --> 02:18:50.170
another child will have another genes

02:18:50.190 --> 02:18:51.940
So how can that be?

02:18:51.940 --> 02:18:53.670
So, it’s not from the parents,

02:18:53.670 --> 02:18:55.630
it’s not from anything,

02:18:55.659 --> 02:19:02.898
circumstances but it is with your own reactions to things that you develop genes.

02:19:02.920 --> 02:19:06.548
So, what happens with genes is that

02:19:06.568 --> 02:19:11.312
you become a very, very religious man,

02:19:11.402 --> 02:19:14.935
very religious in the real sense

02:19:14.904 --> 02:19:19.565
Not religion because you pray too much nothing but inside,

02:19:19.585 --> 02:19:21.485
inside you are so religious.

02:19:21.505 --> 02:19:23.731
And religion is what is love,

02:19:23.755 --> 02:19:26.985
love for humanity is religion

02:19:26.996 --> 02:19:28.966
and that becomes so innate

02:19:28.976 --> 02:19:31.576
and so in born and you enjoy.

02:19:31.605 --> 02:19:32.935
you see loving people.

02:19:32.926 --> 02:19:35.438
You enjoy giving your love to others.

02:19:35.455 --> 02:19:37.708
Even those who hate you,

02:19:37.716 --> 02:19:40.558
you love to give them love

02:19:40.574 --> 02:19:44.574
because you think hatred after all is due to ignorance,

02:19:44.623 --> 02:19:48.456
is not because he hates you really but ignorance.

02:19:48.536 --> 02:19:52.116
And you start seeing the whole thing in a very different vision.

02:19:52.181 --> 02:19:55.520
So, I have a great vision of our country

02:19:55.580 --> 02:20:00.298
achieving that en masse emancipation,

02:20:00.310 --> 02:20:03.538
awakening and so let the whole world come here.

02:20:03.540 --> 02:20:07.471
Once, they came just to give us slavery.

02:20:07.520 --> 02:20:12.041
Now, let them come here to learn what is Divine.

02:20:12.051 --> 02:20:14.531
And you all can do it very well.

02:20:14.682 --> 02:20:16.981
You don’t have to read many books,

02:20:17.021 --> 02:20:18.171
nothing of the kind.

02:20:18.191 --> 02:20:19.852
We don’t give also books to people

02:20:19.912 --> 02:20:22.051
because if you give them books

02:20:22.172 --> 02:20:25.236
they will just become masters of the books

02:20:25.236 --> 02:20:28.550
and will not achieve anything they should go deep down

02:20:28.630 --> 02:20:31.231
First of all, they should be themselves

02:20:31.232 --> 02:20:33.552
completely one with the Divine.

02:20:33.619 --> 02:20:35.681
Otherwise they are not entitled,

02:20:35.715 --> 02:20:37.615
they have no powers.

02:20:37.674 --> 02:20:40.751
When you are not empowered, how will you do the job?

02:20:41.034 --> 02:20:43.811
But for that you don’t have to spend too much time,

02:20:43.844 --> 02:20:46.405
five minutes in the morning, ten minutes in the evening.

02:20:46.465 --> 02:20:48.408
If you can meditate nothing like it

02:20:48.411 --> 02:20:50.070
and you will be surprised

02:20:50.130 --> 02:20:52.900
that all your thought process will slow down

02:20:52.931 --> 02:20:56.260
so much so that you can see clearly

02:20:56.320 --> 02:21:00.199
what is right, what is wrong.

02:21:00.210 --> 02:21:02.389
What’s going wrong with you also

02:21:02.449 --> 02:21:03.980
because you get self-knowledge.

02:21:04.039 --> 02:21:05.889
And also, with others

02:21:05.940 --> 02:21:08.800
because you develop a new dimension

02:21:08.871 --> 02:21:12.590
which we call as collective consciousness,

02:21:12.610 --> 02:21:14.630
Samuhik Chaitanya,

02:21:14.670 --> 02:21:16.250
collective consciousness.

02:21:16.331 --> 02:21:20.215
Sitting down here you can feel the vibrations of Mr. Clinton.

02:21:20.275 --> 02:21:24.204
or you can feel the vibrations of any person anywhere,

02:21:24.224 --> 02:21:25.763
sitting down here.

02:21:25.795 --> 02:21:28.664
Now if you know how to correct these vibrations,

02:21:28.655 --> 02:21:30.103
your own vibrations,

02:21:30.123 --> 02:21:32.605
you can correct the vibrations of others.

02:21:32.675 --> 02:21:36.246
You can correct the vibrations sitting down here

02:21:36.278 --> 02:21:38.246
of other people who are far away.

02:21:38.239 --> 02:21:41.079
But of course, you can also correct the vibrations

02:21:41.128 --> 02:21:43.646
of people who are with you.

02:21:43.676 --> 02:21:46.856
In your family there are people who are mad,

02:21:47.316 --> 02:21:48.703
You can correct them.

02:21:48.725 --> 02:21:50.867
So, we can have very good families

02:21:50.876 --> 02:21:53.127
and we could have very good marriages.

02:21:53.145 --> 02:21:55.087
It has many dimensions Sahaja Yoga

02:21:55.115 --> 02:21:59.030
but today is the day I want to really thank you all

02:21:59.091 --> 02:22:02.980
the medical science people, and the industrialists,

02:22:02.980 --> 02:22:05.629
that they should now take to Sahaja Yoga

02:22:05.690 --> 02:22:08.066
and make the best of their lives,

02:22:08.127 --> 02:22:12.026
lives which are brought in this great country of Yoga

02:22:12.037 --> 02:22:14.157
where you can easily achieve.

02:22:14.226 --> 02:22:17.236
In this country, it is so full of vibrations,

02:22:17.316 --> 02:22:19.963
so full of vibrations, you won’t believe.

02:22:20.043 --> 02:22:22.324
I was coming from London with my husband,

02:22:22.394 --> 02:22:24.436
and I told him, “We have touched India.”

02:22:24.444 --> 02:22:27.266
He said, “How do you know?” I said, “See the vibrations all around.

02:22:27.274 --> 02:22:29.316
It’s only in India you feel these vibrations.”

02:22:29.324 --> 02:22:31.566
So, he went to the pilot just to find out.

02:22:31.574 --> 02:22:35.225
He said, “Sir, only a minute back we touched India.”

02:22:35.244 --> 02:22:37.966
So, this is such a great country you have.

02:22:42.455 --> 02:22:44.951
And if we could just develop that feeling

02:22:44.955 --> 02:22:46.921
that we are Indians

02:22:46.955 --> 02:22:49.425
and it is our responsibility

02:22:49.455 --> 02:22:52.415
to see that our knowledge goes all over

02:22:52.455 --> 02:22:54.599
and let people take advantage of it.

02:22:54.689 --> 02:22:56.628
By that we don’t criticise anyone.

02:22:56.718 --> 02:22:59.149
By that we don’t condemn anybody, as I have told you,

02:22:59.218 --> 02:23:04.210
but we give them the basis of all the knowledge,

02:23:04.230 --> 02:23:09.490
and that, in Sahaja Yoga, you can do it very well.

02:23:09.530 --> 02:23:12.228
I would say that instead of reading the book

02:23:12.244 --> 02:23:14.458
better get your Realisation

02:23:14.466 --> 02:23:15.966
because Kabira himself has said it,

02:23:16.035 --> 02:23:19.098
“Padhi Padhi pundit murakh bhayo,

02:23:19.138 --> 02:23:22.358
pundit bhayo na koye, dhai akshar prem ka,

02:23:22.378 --> 02:23:24.638
seekhe to pundit hoye.”

02:23:24.652 --> 02:23:31.259
Even after studying all books and scriptures a scholar becomes a fool, nobody becomes a scholar.

02:23:31.259 --> 02:23:35.859
Whoever learns two and a half words of love, he becomes a scholar.

02:23:35.918 --> 02:23:38.040
Thank you very much.
