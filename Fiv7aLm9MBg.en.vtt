00:16:29.787 --> 00:16:35.302
Today is very bigger day for us,
also 'vasant panchami' is there

00:16:36.263 --> 00:16:39.952
Again it's national day today

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:44.817
The people are grateful to see this day

00:16:45.199 --> 00:16:47.952
How many people had abandoned their life?.

00:16:48.821 --> 00:16:55.321
How many things have happened,
but we have not yet come to that stage.

00:16:55.531 --> 00:17:03.124
Where you know this,Yes,
the country is of great

00:17:03.149 --> 00:17:09.632
importance,People have
won the sacrifice.

00:17:09.657 --> 00:17:14.221
Even when we called up
the rebellion in this

00:17:14.246 --> 00:17:19.426
country, Gandhiji thought
that this country's

00:17:21.502 --> 00:17:25.148
That which is real wealth,
it is spiritual.

00:17:25.123 --> 00:17:28.870
Self-power is not violent
but non-violence, and

00:17:28.895 --> 00:17:32.641
therefore they will make
all over non-violence.

00:17:33.138 --> 00:17:36.888
We have won the country for
without any violence

00:17:37.145 --> 00:17:41.093
When this happened,
we do not realize that

00:17:41.118 --> 00:17:44.919
Now this is what we have
earned so much wealth,

00:17:45.507 --> 00:17:49.265
Yes, that's what we keep,
Yes, you has got diamonds

00:17:49.283 --> 00:17:52.027
In Which sacrifice to fit?

00:17:52.322 --> 00:17:58.122
So that's what it's sacrificing
They must be of this soil

00:17:57.939 --> 00:18:04.941
Whatever the sacrifice of this soil,
They have sacrificed themselves.

00:18:04.882 --> 00:18:06.629
You have nothing else to do.

00:18:06.629 --> 00:18:09.455
What is the main thing in
this country,that is, all the

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.130
space that is the element,the
power of self, it is..

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:16.631
That should be discarded on self-power.

00:18:16.631 --> 00:18:21.542
As long as the sacrifice of independence
will not be put on self-centeredness,

00:18:21.786 --> 00:18:23.441
The welfare of this country will not be there

00:18:23.794 --> 00:18:29.438
But for that, we should create such a people,
which has received this self-discipline.

00:18:29.562 --> 00:18:36.062
But I still see that the people that got self-conscious
Who has gained self-confidence

00:18:36.431 --> 00:18:45.331
They are still playing very tightly and
are living with a very frantic situation.

00:18:45.798 --> 00:18:51.054
The kind of thing that has happened to
me is so troubled me yesterday

00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:55.037
I have decided that I do not want to
talk about that anymore.

00:18:56.757 --> 00:18:59.012
Relations,How did it come?

00:18:59.012 --> 00:19:02.260
We say relation come in Maharashtra.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.512
Brothers kill you after one another

00:19:05.512 --> 00:19:08.766
Something bothered, what happened to it?

00:19:09.131 --> 00:19:11.634
That's because we took addiction.

00:19:12.127 --> 00:19:14.703
You might be surprised if
you add some additives to

00:19:14.728 --> 00:19:17.379
Vishuddhi chakra,
you do not have any kind of wisdom.

00:19:17.379 --> 00:19:19.288
He does not live nicely.

00:19:19.288 --> 00:19:25.289
He lied and did not think he had
missed anything even though he did

00:19:25.289 --> 00:19:31.042
This addiction has grown so much in
our country and it's on such a large scale,

00:19:31.042 --> 00:19:35.541
People do not notice that they are suffering,

00:19:36.539 --> 00:19:39.044
People say so many lies about.

00:19:39.044 --> 00:19:41.291
They are behaving so badly.

00:19:41.291 --> 00:19:44.292
And so much lies are in the world

00:19:44.292 --> 00:19:46.792
Yes, for the first time
to get rid of falsehood,

00:19:46.817 --> 00:19:49.037
first of all should be
left with addiction.

00:19:48.861 --> 00:19:53.357
The man who does not completely forget to addiction,
His nature will not be good.

00:19:53.357 --> 00:20:01.857
He will do falsehood, he will do a false thing
and everything that is true will be false

00:20:01.857 --> 00:20:07.358
So one day on this big day many
people spend their lives

00:20:07.358 --> 00:20:08.944
Many gave life

00:20:09.309 --> 00:20:11.509
Many have shed their blood

00:20:11.191 --> 00:20:19.083
From this time immemorial, we struggled for independence,
now for self-rule, to self-help

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:23.669
People today pledge that we will
not do any addiction anymore

00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:24.670
Any kind

00:20:25.168 --> 00:20:26.668
This is not a difficult task

00:20:27.169 --> 00:20:30.420
I see people from foreign countries
that they are so sharp

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:34.421
Once that is achieved, on the next day
it becomes free, by leaving everything,

00:20:34.421 --> 00:20:37.175
That was not what they were

00:20:37.917 --> 00:20:41.678
As soon as a lotus comes up in a moment,
it gets so much sweeter

00:20:41.678 --> 00:20:43.672
But not in our country.

00:20:43.672 --> 00:20:46.419
There are some types of activities in our country

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:48.049
But this is the only way,
It's gonna be there.

00:20:48.049 --> 00:20:53.050
For ten ten years, peoples in sahajayoga
Why not make some progress?

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:57.549
The reason is that they have not been
able to relieve themselves of addiction.

00:20:58.303 --> 00:21:00.048
This slavery should gone

00:21:00.048 --> 00:21:02.015
The slaughter of addiction is that it should go.

00:21:02.513 --> 00:21:05.509
The second guru's slavery is very terrible to you

00:21:05.759 --> 00:21:08.012
I met a gentleman yesterday

00:21:08.261 --> 00:21:09.759
They were so many years in sahajayoga.

00:21:09.759 --> 00:21:12.014
But his master's slavery is not gone

00:21:12.014 --> 00:21:14.012
So they are still in trouble.

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:15.762
There is no one listening to these things

00:21:15.762 --> 00:21:17.269
Nobody would believe it.

00:21:17.269 --> 00:21:23.758
But if your guru is wrong, then you have
seen that you are suffering from it

00:21:24.507 --> 00:21:26.266
This slavery,
Should have gone

00:21:26.266 --> 00:21:31.520
You should keep in mind that for slavery,
People who come from Guru.

00:21:31.361 --> 00:21:33.609
They are physically afflicted

00:21:33.609 --> 00:21:39.858
If your master can not keep your body properly,
then why should such a guru be enslaved?

00:21:40.362 --> 00:21:42.863
This is superstition and it is a vengeful sign.

00:21:42.967 --> 00:21:47.974
In the vengeful symptom, Shrikrishna said,
that when a person becomes vengeful

00:21:47.974 --> 00:21:51.473
Then some unfixed things are
pulled up completely

00:21:51.473 --> 00:21:54.470
That condition only believes the truth

00:21:56.967 --> 00:22:02.472
Suppose,one bull tie to the oil extractor poll
and put scarp on eyes,He is wandering in there

00:22:02.472 --> 00:22:06.571
And no matter how much you told him
that he is wrong, he does not think so

00:22:06.571 --> 00:22:08.070
It do not go into his head

00:22:09.074 --> 00:22:12.323
This vengeful tendency is
especially in our Maharashtra.

00:22:12.323 --> 00:22:15.821
The reason we tell him the reason
is that we are very addicted

00:22:15.821 --> 00:22:20.321
And the fundamentalists, in those days
we have grown up in the customs,

00:22:20.321 --> 00:22:22.961
You never stop that fundamental.

00:22:23.459 --> 00:22:28.334
Now first of all, see that you should fast now

00:22:29.079 --> 00:22:30.697
Who said that? Which scripture?

00:22:30.697 --> 00:22:32.701
If no one says so, no one can show.

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:36.169
If you have a passion to fast anytime.

00:22:36.169 --> 00:22:40.292
So whoever you wish about will be the same.

00:22:40.919 --> 00:22:44.041
People in our country are also starving

00:22:45.544 --> 00:22:50.038
Why should I fast even more,
I do not understand,

00:22:50.293 --> 00:22:53.434
If you would like to fast,then die

00:22:53.434 --> 00:22:57.798
It seems like the future will be hungry,
want fasting, take it.

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:01.798
You should only get
what you are interested in.

00:23:01.798 --> 00:23:06.137
When you fast,
Then let it be hungry

00:23:06.388 --> 00:23:08.140
Then why cry?

00:23:08.392 --> 00:23:12.406
Everything is for eat and they
do not want to eat it in the name of God

00:23:12.406 --> 00:23:15.410
You should not eat it,
but eat it in the name of God

00:23:15.658 --> 00:23:18.909
Next is the path of devotion,
the path of devotion has drawn one

00:23:18.909 --> 00:23:21.401
But that's not the way it's going to be

00:23:21.401 --> 00:23:22.651
It should be noted

00:23:23.658 --> 00:23:27.521
devotion, exclusive devotion is told by Krishna

00:23:27.769 --> 00:23:34.022
The path of devotion is to sit on the ground,
to walk away from it

00:23:34.488 --> 00:23:36.770
Dress clothes, like beggar

00:23:36.991 --> 00:23:41.226
Going there playing the Manjeera,
And to break the head

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.352
That is called the devotional path

00:23:42.352 --> 00:23:44.848
Who said this?

00:23:47.351 --> 00:23:55.222
Dnyaneshwar did not say that you used to go to
perform 'Hare Rama' Hare, doing there.

00:23:55.222 --> 00:23:58.970
Or do we say Vitthal Vitthal
by doing Krishna Krishna

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:01.223
So do not go anywhere

00:24:04.221 --> 00:24:06.579
Those who wrote it did not read

00:24:06.579 --> 00:24:09.077
They did not understand
what they explained

00:24:09.077 --> 00:24:14.952
Now it is said that, 'Aata Vishwatmake...Toshawe'.

00:24:14.952 --> 00:24:18.707
He should show the spirit of the universe

00:24:18.707 --> 00:24:21.195
He should be happy

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:26.600
Whatever sacrifice has been offered to me,
Let's be satisfied

00:24:26.956 --> 00:24:30.961
And then what to give?
Give it to Pasaydan

00:24:31.829 --> 00:24:33.583
This pasaydaan is given to you.

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:38.079
This is what the vibrations have been
given to youvthis is pasaydaan.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.080
The dark darkness of sinful man
disappeared,did gone?

00:24:43.788 --> 00:24:47.038
Those who played majeera,
Does ignorance go?

00:24:47.538 --> 00:24:53.291
Too dry, dried, beggar
they do not have proper clothes on body.

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:57.038
Seeing the person coming to cry
Where did the sinful man come from?

00:24:57.038 --> 00:25:00.678
And say we are devotees of Shri hari !

00:25:01.531 --> 00:25:09.528
Hey, who gave Sudama to Dwarka,
this devotee, this beggar people

00:25:11.279 --> 00:25:14.260
Why are you people defaming Krishna?

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:18.258
Be a devotee of another person,Fraud Babaji's

00:25:18.258 --> 00:25:22.509
Whose rinkle should be counted,
This type of Babaji are many

00:25:23.257 --> 00:25:25.009
Devote them.

00:25:25.256 --> 00:25:27.647
But why do you defame Shrikrishna?

00:25:27.897 --> 00:25:31.147
Where did you not read the
description of their face?

00:25:31.901 --> 00:25:34.396
Did not read the description of his brilliance?

00:25:34.396 --> 00:25:37.897
Where he was a beggar, nobody told.

00:25:37.897 --> 00:25:43.648
Even though cows maintained,
the crown was on the head.

00:25:44.648 --> 00:25:46.137
We have already heard of it ,
about dress up

00:25:46.137 --> 00:25:50.378
Where did you hear that he was
carrying a bush in his hands beggar ?

00:25:50.378 --> 00:25:52.847
Tobacco filled in drink

00:25:57.847 --> 00:25:58.868
This is our condition

00:25:58.868 --> 00:26:03.768
But do not think about it,
And black ash on the head

00:26:04.019 --> 00:26:06.519
does he apply black ash on head

00:26:07.767 --> 00:26:12.767
How pretty even,Turns the sandal on the head

00:26:13.016 --> 00:26:20.817
That was his sign,even if you look around,
why do you walk around with black ash?

00:26:20.817 --> 00:26:23.203
With those black ashes,
it will ruin your ajnya chakra.

00:26:23.228 --> 00:26:27.066
The more you will be in a vengeful perspective.

00:26:29.231 --> 00:26:32.479
But you said that Mataji,
why do you say so?

00:26:33.056 --> 00:26:37.057
That is what they want me to tell
and it should tell you

00:26:37.057 --> 00:26:39.347
Then you got the disease
tomorrow, there were cancerous

00:26:39.372 --> 00:26:41.556
diseases, there were diseases
of the vishudhhi chakra

00:26:41.556 --> 00:26:45.057
Diseases like this,The disease happened
That is to say,Mataji what's this?

00:26:45.057 --> 00:26:50.698
We are Warkaris(devotee),
that is to blame in God

00:26:51.201 --> 00:26:53.697
This vengeful tendency should have gone

00:26:53.697 --> 00:26:57.688
Walk through the scarf on the eye.
We are in the path of devotion

00:26:57.688 --> 00:27:00.158
Hey, what's the way?

00:27:00.907 --> 00:27:03.160
God has said, Make exclusive devotion

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.707
Krishna has explained it
clearly,That you will give

00:27:05.732 --> 00:27:08.157
me something,pamphlet,
fruit, and he will take it

00:27:08.157 --> 00:27:11.410
But giving it clear that you should
give exclusive devotion

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:13.907
What else could he do?

00:27:14.408 --> 00:27:15.907
When will exclusive devotion be?

00:27:15.907 --> 00:27:19.387
When you walk aloud with God

00:27:19.637 --> 00:27:21.432
When you feel confident

00:27:21.432 --> 00:27:24.642
Whenever you worship him,
it has something meaning

00:27:25.639 --> 00:27:28.629
We have such an evil
reputation of Krishna everywhere

00:27:28.629 --> 00:27:31.627
Are doing abroad,
doing so here too.

00:27:31.877 --> 00:27:36.129
Where is Lord Krishna and
where are the people of Warakari(devotee).

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:39.354
I do not see the compilation of the two

00:27:43.682 --> 00:27:51.431
So, whatever we are old, we want
to get the best, best of them

00:27:51.431 --> 00:27:54.678
And that which has been imposed on us,
it should be left

00:27:54.678 --> 00:27:58.686
In the Sahajayoga,
we are doing great devotion

00:27:59.178 --> 00:28:02.601
Everything happens,
but only after self-realization

00:28:02.601 --> 00:28:04.401
Before that we did not do it.

00:28:04.651 --> 00:28:07.152
Secondly, fasting is not what we do

00:28:07.152 --> 00:28:10.404
If you want to fast,then do it,
Now I am fasting already

00:28:11.147 --> 00:28:15.147
I Forever Fasting is done by your grace

00:28:15.147 --> 00:28:18.148
No lunch, no meal in the evening

00:28:18.148 --> 00:28:19.901
Something is going on

00:28:19.901 --> 00:28:22.899
If you do not want me to
fast then I can do it

00:28:22.899 --> 00:28:27.404
But even if you want to do it,
you can do it for yourself or for your body

00:28:28.151 --> 00:28:30.649
But do not tell it as a stomach disorder

00:28:31.901 --> 00:28:36.403
So we need to understand that
we are going to be vigilant,

00:28:36.403 --> 00:28:39.650
Now we do not want to
go to the royal state

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:43.152
This peopole is other
it is of a political nature.

00:28:43.152 --> 00:28:47.862
What they did not know,
what was wrong and what was good

00:28:47.862 --> 00:28:49.864
The mistake and the good one at all

00:28:50.111 --> 00:28:52.612
That is, we feel that these
people are human or animals !

00:28:52.612 --> 00:28:58.862
They do not understand this, that
they eat cabbage, that they eat shit

00:28:58.862 --> 00:29:02.862
He also does not understand the difference,
People are royaltyers

00:29:03.108 --> 00:29:08.110
And if this state of the state came,
But a big question arises in him

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:12.614
Because such people are
confused and completely confused

00:29:12.614 --> 00:29:14.684
So do not understand what
they want to explain

00:29:14.684 --> 00:29:17.680
So everyone thinks,
what's wrong with this?

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:22.556
Now here London is a new one,
Exiting daily.

00:29:22.551 --> 00:29:24.052
Now there's a new one

00:29:24.052 --> 00:29:30.051
The new one happened for four years,
That needle socks into your mouth

00:29:31.321 --> 00:29:37.759
If not, then insert the pin
And paint the hair and go out.

00:29:38.108 --> 00:29:42.760
I said, why do this? they said,
So what's wrong with this?

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:47.508
What's wrong with this?
Does we have any answer?

00:29:51.899 --> 00:29:54.152
So they do such foolishness

00:29:54.491 --> 00:29:58.241
It does not matter if you say
anything to that stupidity

00:29:58.241 --> 00:30:00.238
Because they think, we all know

00:30:00.238 --> 00:30:00.993
What's wrong or bad?

00:30:00.993 --> 00:30:02.480
What do you say?

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:05.565
That is, the monsters are
good, the evil is also good,

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:08.506
the thief one is good and
the Mahatma is also good.

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:11.977
And God is good. Everything is good,
all are same.

00:30:12.234 --> 00:30:15.478
Hitler is good and krushna is also good.

00:30:15.478 --> 00:30:17.120
There is no difference between them

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.119
No one should say bad .all good

00:30:19.119 --> 00:30:21.116
There is nothing bad to say

00:30:21.116 --> 00:30:22.871
This was the stage of royalness

00:30:22.871 --> 00:30:24.871
You now have the royal nature

00:30:24.871 --> 00:30:27.620
Because you are making progress now

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:29.372
Due to the progressive country you are

00:30:29.372 --> 00:30:33.121
Now there is a humble request that
you should not progress there

00:30:33.121 --> 00:30:36.124
Now we have to make such progress right now

00:30:36.124 --> 00:30:40.075
She wants to progress
through the Crown Chakra and

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.896
That is to make progress
in the higher direction

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:47.122
For This,What's wrong with this?
What's wrong with him?

00:30:47.346 --> 00:30:48.837
Why do this?
why do that?

00:30:48.837 --> 00:30:51.844
If that desire were to happen, we would have
thought that we became a royal

00:30:51.844 --> 00:30:54.341
It's worse than vengeful.

00:30:56.092 --> 00:30:59.868
Because once you can remove
bond,But by the way, From the

00:30:59.893 --> 00:31:03.864
point of view, the restriction on the
eye, how to remove it?

00:31:05.838 --> 00:31:07.590
So,do not go to that situation.

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:09.588
What's wrong with this
What's wrong in him

00:31:09.588 --> 00:31:12.338
You are your master in Sahajayoga.

00:31:12.338 --> 00:31:16.845
Vibrations come in your hands and
you know what's wrong with you

00:31:16.845 --> 00:31:18.528
Then,Fix Your Vibrations.

00:31:18.528 --> 00:31:21.790
But there is a situation
where people do not understand

00:31:21.815 --> 00:31:24.551
anything, whether we
have lost anything or not

00:31:25.035 --> 00:31:29.034
This situation should not occur

00:31:29.528 --> 00:31:32.033
That is my request by adding my hands

00:31:32.282 --> 00:31:39.286
Today, in this good news, we all have to tell
you that you are born in this holy soil.

00:31:39.782 --> 00:31:43.284
I now go to Coimbatore day before yesterday,
they said that you will live in Pune now ?

00:31:43.284 --> 00:31:45.033
It is said to be punyapattanum.

00:31:45.033 --> 00:31:47.030
All said by adding their hands

00:31:47.131 --> 00:31:58.033
Said, 'Why?'
... now you see it all

00:31:58.284 --> 00:32:01.780
This is what they were .it was
what they were described

00:32:04.031 --> 00:32:11.861
This story tells us that once Pundarikaksh
took his father and mother

00:32:11.861 --> 00:32:14.280
Came to Mumbai city.
Maybe even Pune has come

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.031
There is a story about Pune.
Do not know if there will be any.

00:32:16.528 --> 00:32:20.030
He said to them,
'I'm not taking you anywhere now.

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:21.973
I have served you very much

00:32:22.469 --> 00:32:24.719
Now,I'm not going to take you forward
Go where you want

00:32:24.719 --> 00:32:31.094
I am not doing your pilgrimage anymore.
He thought, saw the vaibrations and said

00:32:31.094 --> 00:32:32.840
That's it, do it

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:36.590
You take us out of here anyhow

00:32:36.839 --> 00:32:42.592
Then do what you want to do,
As he picked it out of that village, he came to notice

00:32:42.592 --> 00:32:45.591
That's how much is my fault,
He said, forgive me

00:32:45.591 --> 00:32:46.842
Something happened to me

00:32:46.842 --> 00:32:52.341
No, no, I take you away,
Well, I think this often in Pune

00:32:52.341 --> 00:32:53.837
Mumbai has so much

00:32:53.838 --> 00:33:00.338
But now people should decide that,
to pune

00:33:00.338 --> 00:33:05.842
Which Graduation is given from Anadikal
The great saints, great masters

00:33:05.842 --> 00:33:09.090
will celebrate and will do it well

00:33:09.219 --> 00:33:13.321
Today,All of this should be decided in
the mind of the people of Pune

00:33:13.321 --> 00:33:19.570
That's the name of Pune, that's such a great name,
we get such a great principle

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:20.822
what others do?

00:33:21.059 --> 00:33:25.563
Others do this,Others do thieves, they do this,
do not want to see others. Others Others

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.146
You are ours.

00:33:27.305 --> 00:33:35.682
What attitude do we leave,Except for small attitude,
we can absorb big ideas

00:33:36.139 --> 00:33:40.139
Secondly, we have the biggest problem
in religion

00:33:40.818 --> 00:33:42.913
Today,have to say about that also

00:33:43.302 --> 00:33:49.290
It is written by Markandey Swaamy about
the idea of ​​caste from Anadikal

00:33:49.375 --> 00:33:51.117
Which is called as consciousness
in all the beings of the

00:33:51.142 --> 00:33:53.010
Goddess The Goddesses who are
situated in power in all castes,

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:55.832
That's what we say every day,
But why we dont understand?

00:33:56.055 --> 00:33:59.682
Means,Whats goddess cast,
that is our cast

00:33:59.682 --> 00:34:03.253
Mahakali, Mahalaxmi and Mahasaraswati are
only three caste in this world

00:34:03.253 --> 00:34:06.767
And the fourth caste is Aadishakti's,
that's your caste.

00:34:07.104 --> 00:34:08.572
It's Beyond that

00:34:08.938 --> 00:34:13.139
Those who are passionate,
their cast of Mahakali's

00:34:13.271 --> 00:34:17.611
Mahasaraswati's caste for
those who are of Royal

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:20.786
Those who are righteous,
their castes are Mahalakshmi

00:34:20.865 --> 00:34:25.192
There are three castes in this
way and the fourth which is

00:34:25.217 --> 00:34:29.397
going on is beyond the castes,
that is to say,Trigunatit

00:34:30.135 --> 00:34:32.668
In this situation you are sitting today

00:34:32.757 --> 00:34:35.823
So do not fight on castes

00:34:35.839 --> 00:34:40.303
We are this,we are that,this,that,
Those who really do not really do anything

00:34:41.398 --> 00:34:45.792
With such a brawl,then we say that
why we have given the kingdom to them?

00:34:45.824 --> 00:34:47.386
Means Shivaji was
kunabi(lower cast)

00:34:47.411 --> 00:34:48.945
Why did give the kingdom?

00:34:48.951 --> 00:34:50.121
There are many people who say so

00:34:50.447 --> 00:34:55.637
Now who is sitting on your kingdom?
Parsi is a man coming and sitting,Tell him

00:34:55.812 --> 00:35:03.470
Came all Brahmins and say.tell,
They become friendly with all

00:35:03.595 --> 00:35:05.975
That man is good
But its meaning

00:35:05.984 --> 00:35:12.179
Who has said that?Even if Shivaji Maharaj is in situation,
you give him trouble

00:35:12.751 --> 00:35:17.609
also told Gandhi ji that you
make atonement at Nashik

00:35:18.014 --> 00:35:22.395
You make atonement,
from such a great man

00:35:22.863 --> 00:35:26.414
I once said to Mahatmaji,
'Why do you go to make atonement?

00:35:26.463 --> 00:35:29.859
He said,If I did not go,
they would've shot mi

00:35:30.684 --> 00:35:32.684
Whom did you give up?

00:35:33.478 --> 00:35:38.801
You must remove people from that class,
and this is the idea that you have

00:35:38.881 --> 00:35:41.643
That is, showing others down in religion

00:35:43.516 --> 00:35:48.789
Every time that big people were there
Everyone in this country tried this

00:35:48.853 --> 00:35:52.758
That people should remove
this idea from their minds

00:35:52.877 --> 00:35:55.194
eknath feeds water to donkey.

00:35:55.599 --> 00:35:57.439
Naamdev was a tailor.

00:35:58.234 --> 00:36:00.638
We had a gentleman butcher

00:36:00.678 --> 00:36:02.545
He is considered to be a saint.

00:36:02.629 --> 00:36:05.072
Tukaram also always used
to say that If I had

00:36:05.097 --> 00:36:08.960
become a Mahar(lower Caste),
it will good for mi

00:36:09.367 --> 00:36:14.894
Why this?That is, they are often told that
this madness of caste should be gone

00:36:15.611 --> 00:36:17.372
And so many miracles happened

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:20.408
Their Volume came out in the Indrayani(river)
which was immersed, all happened

00:36:20.432 --> 00:36:22.583
But people have not understand that

00:36:22.599 --> 00:36:26.260
The thing which is holy is different,
the fight between castes is different

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:29.347
They will not learn because
the eyes are close

00:36:30.267 --> 00:36:33.537
So this kind of caste does not work for us,
We do not want that kind of caste

00:36:33.617 --> 00:36:36.141
We will not do this,
we will not do that

00:36:38.815 --> 00:36:43.878
Such people who speak,
And in this way the people who spread the atmosphere

00:36:44.037 --> 00:36:46.304
There was a defect only in our country

00:36:46.471 --> 00:36:49.757
Well, it still needs to be done in practical terms

00:36:49.852 --> 00:36:52.920
that,some caste boy married with another caste girl

00:36:53.095 --> 00:36:58.634
There is no difference between them
and this kind of marriage, but they have advantages

00:36:58.968 --> 00:37:03.202
Suppose,If you married in your caste
and did Maratha in Marathas

00:37:03.932 --> 00:37:07.051
So, he has not sent anything to Diwali.

00:37:07.456 --> 00:37:12.337
How much did dowry?To talk properly,
How much did dowry?

00:37:12.751 --> 00:37:16.829
I want to get married,
then the girl should be the same

00:37:17.092 --> 00:37:21.486
If someone tricks her,
then who will come from the community?

00:37:21.971 --> 00:37:24.100
f you send the girl home,
if didnt give dowry,, But at

00:37:24.125 --> 00:37:26.137
that time can someone is
standing in the community?

00:37:26.471 --> 00:37:31.796
Dies For such castes,
oppressed people torture their girls

00:37:31.931 --> 00:37:35.987
Not only that, I feel that one of
those media is atrocity.

00:37:36.233 --> 00:37:38.905
The girls used to abuse and
torture to them

00:37:38.911 --> 00:37:42.390
It must be married in this caste,
This is a medium

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:45.207
It is a medium to
persecute those girls

00:37:45.549 --> 00:37:50.669
We are harassing ourselves,
our own, our girls every day.

00:37:51.709 --> 00:37:57.442
If another son got good,If you got good in
the others caste, then what is the problem?

00:37:57.519 --> 00:38:00.257
What should be the problem,
there is no objection

00:38:00.638 --> 00:38:01.771
But it does not look like that

00:38:02.201 --> 00:38:03.801
It is not so practical

00:38:03.947 --> 00:38:08.858
But tomorrow in that caste left our
daughter, So that being helps you

00:38:08.877 --> 00:38:13.540
Even when it appeared front of us,
we got married in our own caste only.

00:38:15.238 --> 00:38:17.047
Stubbornness like this

00:38:17.396 --> 00:38:21.539
That is,You really have
something radish on girls head

00:38:23.466 --> 00:38:25.013
We're putting a lot of weight

00:38:25.141 --> 00:38:28.478
If you want to, you can do it in
your caste If you want,return it.

00:38:28.692 --> 00:38:31.208
But why do you bother that girl

00:38:31.597 --> 00:38:35.042
Troubled her
tomorrow,mother-in-law troubled her

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:37.618
You do not go and say
that we married in a caste

00:38:37.682 --> 00:38:40.906
n it you will have a reputation for
being 'we married in our caste'

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:43.025
What are you going to get?

00:38:43.498 --> 00:38:44.965
Why do you get?

00:38:46.971 --> 00:38:48.571
It is special in womens

00:38:48.967 --> 00:38:50.487
That should be in our caste

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:55.059
So you have to showoff something after
that What you get? i do not understand.

00:38:55.821 --> 00:38:57.575
Gandhiji tried.

00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:00.393
Tilak made efforts before Gandhiji

00:39:00.581 --> 00:39:02.714
Tilak married widow himself

00:39:04.065 --> 00:39:05.343
Agarkar did

00:39:05.414 --> 00:39:10.493
How many people have tried,
but we have not fulfilled that effort

00:39:11.041 --> 00:39:16.231
Now, when it comes back to sahajayoga,
do not have to do things like casteism

00:39:16.474 --> 00:39:18.600
We do not believe in caste.

00:39:18.672 --> 00:39:21.958
We consider only cast.
that is sahajayoga.

00:39:22.061 --> 00:39:25.441
Sahajaogya is the story of World religions

00:39:26.449 --> 00:39:31.464
This is a world religion and there
is nothing like casteism, hatred etc.

00:39:31.552 --> 00:39:35.825
A single God and all the
people of mankind he created

00:39:35.905 --> 00:39:39.540
Those who have achieved God now,
when they enter the kingdom of God

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:41.413
Do not take it there,
mad people from here.

00:39:41.787 --> 00:39:44.410
bawannakuli(caste) and this and that

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:56.157
A gentleman said to me,caste(kul) .talk about
caste mataji, i said ..caste..you have a big.

00:39:56.559 --> 00:39:58.169
caste come from where ?

00:39:58.210 --> 00:40:01.254
Who is your goddess, from there

00:40:01.517 --> 00:40:03.584
That is, the goddess came back or not.

00:40:04.421 --> 00:40:05.621
Which is your kul(caste)?

00:40:05.675 --> 00:40:10.231
If we are of any caste,
our Goddess may be one.

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:12.254
Suppose someone's goddess is Jagadamba.

00:40:12.516 --> 00:40:18.497
hen it can be of a goldsmith or a Brahmin.
it can be Maratha's, anyone can be.

00:40:18.545 --> 00:40:21.044
That is, whether their caste
is for Jagdamba or not.

00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:23.362
That is, the kul(caste) became Jagdamba's

00:40:23.656 --> 00:40:27.505
We have Kul(caste) from the Goddess

00:40:27.934 --> 00:40:29.576
Not from the God

00:40:29.902 --> 00:40:33.969
That is, the identity of the kul(caste)
is known on mother, and it is also true

00:40:34.812 --> 00:40:39.613
Thats why we say 'ya devi
sarvabhuteshu,jatiru pen sansthita'

00:40:39.693 --> 00:40:41.971
It's your caste,
This is your caste of greatness

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:44.539
Now I ask what is
the kul(caste) of Shivaji?

00:40:45.063 --> 00:40:46.190
No one can tell.

00:40:46.252 --> 00:40:48.977
One might say, Jagadamba,
someone would say, Bhavani

00:40:49.048 --> 00:40:50.525
Bhavani was his mother.

00:40:50.819 --> 00:40:51.986
They have a kantyayani.

00:40:52.073 --> 00:40:53.676
kantyayani was his kul(caste).

00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:55.779
kantyayani was his
goddess kul(caste).

00:40:56.192 --> 00:40:58.685
Now, whether it is the Casteism of
their caste or not, do not know

00:40:58.756 --> 00:41:00.226
this is Casteism.

00:41:00.321 --> 00:41:01.241
This is kul(caste).

00:41:01.313 --> 00:41:02.543
This is the greatness of kul(caste).

00:41:02.559 --> 00:41:07.041
To get something done,that we are this
much kul(cast) and that much kul(caste)

00:41:07.066 --> 00:41:08.383
Type something that does not look like

00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:10.231
All will come together in drinking alcohol.

00:41:10.295 --> 00:41:13.029
If everyone wants to drink alcohol,
then they all sit together and drink.

00:41:13.061 --> 00:41:14.981
Same place

00:41:15.037 --> 00:41:18.973
When drinking,So what
do we drink alcohol?

00:41:19.101 --> 00:41:23.283
But at the time of drinking water,
we wear holy clothes.

00:41:27.019 --> 00:41:28.765
Even if you want to have cigarettes

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:31.610
If you have half your
remaining thas is also fine

00:41:33.194 --> 00:41:37.618
But at the time of meal, however,
we are very considerate of others.

00:41:38.269 --> 00:41:41.022
That is, if you want to
work in a bad way, you want

00:41:41.047 --> 00:41:43.693
to make a thief,can anyone
ask what's your caste?

00:41:43.933 --> 00:41:47.496
When stolen, they form a team

00:41:47.568 --> 00:41:50.504
When all kind of people steal together

00:41:50.623 --> 00:41:51.942
ame is politics

00:41:52.059 --> 00:41:56.011
Nobody in politics thinks
that, what is your caste?

00:41:56.075 --> 00:41:59.019
When all bad people come
together that means politics.

00:42:00.567 --> 00:42:03.104
But you have to find out
how much you are really bad

00:42:03.367 --> 00:42:05.509
Very bad people

00:42:05.557 --> 00:42:08.795
So this is ours,
just got it right with us.

00:42:12.904 --> 00:42:18.704
This is the situation today that
you have nothing about yourself

00:42:19.008 --> 00:42:22.202
There is no self respect,Because
if there is no demonstration

00:42:22.227 --> 00:42:24.699
of self, then self respect
can come from where?

00:42:25.262 --> 00:42:28.756
It is worthless to say
that things are worthless

00:42:29.081 --> 00:42:31.168
Those things have become so important

00:42:31.566 --> 00:42:33.637
There is no attention
to the real things.

00:42:33.748 --> 00:42:34.970
It's a vengeful symptom

00:42:35.922 --> 00:42:40.022
And this vengeful sign should go through
you, so you have tried your best.

00:42:40.645 --> 00:42:46.046
The vengeful person does not
have any respect for himselfo.

00:42:46.523 --> 00:42:48.087
He does not think about himself.

00:42:48.262 --> 00:42:52.662
I have some self-respect or
should I have some self-respect

00:42:52.992 --> 00:42:54.563
And his whispering all time

00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:57.190
whispering about him,
whispering about them

00:42:57.516 --> 00:43:00.833
Something slayess,
which is called in English,like he did

00:43:01.166 --> 00:43:03.412
From here and
there,his whispering

00:43:03.603 --> 00:43:04.603
slayess

00:43:05.215 --> 00:43:08.762
Likewise,
the royal man is a terror but open

00:43:08.866 --> 00:43:12.032
Openly,
the two ,four will slap you

00:43:12.064 --> 00:43:16.931
If someone gave him two or four, he would
give two-four back, but he would openly

00:43:17.343 --> 00:43:18.574
his all apparent

00:43:18.582 --> 00:43:19.717
That is so much that .....

00:43:19.749 --> 00:43:21.963
It is open to sin,
what is bad in it?

00:43:22.193 --> 00:43:24.193
What is worse than doing it?

00:43:24.391 --> 00:43:26.263
What's wrong with that?.
say this

00:43:26.563 --> 00:43:29.110
If you want to do anything,
then there is no such thing in it

00:43:29.135 --> 00:43:31.801
In all things,
what is wrong with it.

00:43:32.005 --> 00:43:34.894
The other is ashamed to see them.
It is a condition

00:43:35.747 --> 00:43:38.603
So what is your
situation, That you know

00:43:38.651 --> 00:43:40.580
Know what is your cast

00:43:40.771 --> 00:43:44.669
And any caste has been
exhausted, means you Drowned.

00:43:45.042 --> 00:43:50.002
Then it should be multiplied
beyond this species

00:43:50.764 --> 00:43:57.728
It should be done in a multiply. And you
must be self-confident in that situation

00:43:58.141 --> 00:44:00.474
His richnees should be seen in him

00:44:00.848 --> 00:44:05.981
The second symptom of Sahajayoga is that he
should always look happy, he should look cool

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:09.532
Kabirdas said, what do you say,
when you are happy?

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:12.660
If you do not have fun

00:44:13.318 --> 00:44:15.318
Then you are not sahajayogi.

00:44:15.652 --> 00:44:20.319
If you find this,
We will do anything that Mataji said

00:44:21.909 --> 00:44:23.282
I have seen many people like this.

00:44:23.521 --> 00:44:25.386
I said, what are you doing?

00:44:25.537 --> 00:44:26.965
One thousand people will come.

00:44:27.569 --> 00:44:30.488
How can we do it?
Mother, we will take one thousand or three

00:44:30.513 --> 00:44:34.543
thousand men.What about it,that's
enough when we are 10 people

00:44:35.471 --> 00:44:39.706
It is fun, it is called impudence

00:44:39.857 --> 00:44:43.857
If it does not come,
then you still have not been sahajayogi

00:44:44.183 --> 00:44:45.952
What is in it, mother said.

00:44:46.008 --> 00:44:48.127
Then what is going to
happen and happening

00:44:48.706 --> 00:44:51.889
There are many people who
have benefitted from this

00:44:51.968 --> 00:44:54.479
They have seen how
much benefit it has made

00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:55.503
How much did it get

00:44:55.607 --> 00:44:57.019
But it should be anxious.

00:44:57.123 --> 00:44:58.589
Must have fun

00:44:58.956 --> 00:45:03.623
If the fun does not appear in the person,
then something has happened

00:45:04.097 --> 00:45:06.081
He did not have seriousness.

00:45:06.359 --> 00:45:10.176
whisperring in all thing,
paying Attention to small things

00:45:10.223 --> 00:45:16.684
Do not want to do that, do not want to
do it, or do something that is all fun

00:45:16.896 --> 00:45:20.636
Will be deposed,such things
not suitable to sahajayogi

00:45:20.787 --> 00:45:21.787
Just fine.

00:45:22.113 --> 00:45:26.644
If you do all the fun, then you will be surprised,
what kind of work is done? how things happen?

00:45:26.724 --> 00:45:31.548
You have come into the kingdom of God,
If will not having fun now,then when?

00:45:34.064 --> 00:45:39.204
So all this is a happy
day, It's a day of light,

00:45:39.576 --> 00:45:42.544
We got a flag of freedom.

00:45:42.862 --> 00:45:48.520
So I myself in Delhi, saw second flag.
to rising and descending,

00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:52.789
And I said that, this is the beauty
of the flag, it should remain

00:45:53.202 --> 00:46:00.666
And by that grace we all should be
fully integrated with our identity

00:46:01.802 --> 00:46:05.484
Our personality should be
completely integrated only

00:46:05.683 --> 00:46:08.442
That should be fun,
should be joyful

00:46:08.512 --> 00:46:11.409
Everyone should be
involved in the same

00:46:11.893 --> 00:46:14.940
Now these people came
from outside so much.

00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:17.805
I do not have time to talk
to them for two minutes

00:46:18.044 --> 00:46:20.186
It does not take time to sit
near them for two minutes

00:46:20.433 --> 00:46:23.798
They have come from so far, some of them
are such that I have never seen them

00:46:24.076 --> 00:46:25.076
They are in the mood

00:46:25.423 --> 00:46:27.414
I did not spend a minute with them

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:30.002
But they do not feel anything.
In our Maharashtra not llike this

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:31.954
Mothers did not come to my house.

00:46:32.018 --> 00:46:33.526
Not come to my premises.

00:46:34.026 --> 00:46:38.111
have not been to my center,
My, me, mine is very much.

00:46:38.317 --> 00:46:41.380
And mother did not give time to me,
Give me time.

00:46:41.651 --> 00:46:43.651
I have spent all my time in Maharashtra

00:46:43.885 --> 00:46:46.059
There is no time to talk to these people

00:46:46.068 --> 00:46:48.916
I do not even ask
him, how you are?

00:46:49.036 --> 00:46:49.877
To this date.

00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:52.166
How are you ?
It is not even said

00:46:52.381 --> 00:46:54.484
What do they come here,
and what are they?

00:46:54.865 --> 00:46:56.539
means,Thay does not meet.

00:46:56.691 --> 00:46:59.775
Went to their country,
which means that are a little too much

00:47:00.625 --> 00:47:02.767
But they never said that

00:47:02.871 --> 00:47:08.472
Mother, come to me or
come to my home. Talk to me.

00:47:08.591 --> 00:47:09.591
Never

00:47:10.853 --> 00:47:14.369
Well, secondly, if I would go to
someone, then I would go

00:47:14.496 --> 00:47:15.496
That's mine

00:47:15.909 --> 00:47:17.909
I would go wherever I want

00:47:18.131 --> 00:47:20.432
I do my convenience

00:47:20.567 --> 00:47:23.519
People will say,
why did you go to their house?

00:47:23.615 --> 00:47:27.068
Hey there, I get convenience there,
so I go, who will you say?

00:47:27.386 --> 00:47:30.353
So that's me,
that's why you're going there

00:47:30.878 --> 00:47:32.560
To force me to do so

00:47:32.687 --> 00:47:38.456
But all this is a sign of eloquence and
stupidity, that they should not be so.

00:47:38.766 --> 00:47:43.232
So everyone, for two minutes,
come for a minute to me.why?

00:47:44.413 --> 00:47:45.270
Why come?

00:47:45.382 --> 00:47:47.278
What are you going to get?

00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:51.254
troubled me and made me unhappy

00:47:51.501 --> 00:47:53.231
Then,How do i feel happy?

00:47:53.312 --> 00:47:58.517
And how will you get blessings from that
happiness? If you followed my troubles

00:47:58.938 --> 00:48:01.894
So do not insist that to
come my house.

00:48:01.934 --> 00:48:04.688
Come to me.this my should gone.

00:48:05.212 --> 00:48:07.783
Which is your house All
of my houses are there.

00:48:10.526 --> 00:48:11.446
My child,

00:48:12.026 --> 00:48:15.073
My house, my husband,
This is all vengeful symptom.

00:48:15.972 --> 00:48:21.511
It should be kept in mind that whatever
children do my, me, those children should never

00:48:21.853 --> 00:48:23.106
Can not match.

00:48:23.147 --> 00:48:27.201
you have so much heartache
in it that It's a mistake to

00:48:27.226 --> 00:48:32.628
say that, even if he is a
murderer, then he is the baby.

00:48:33.961 --> 00:48:36.516
So we are a sahajayogi
to get away from him

00:48:36.567 --> 00:48:40.667
How should your child be described? You will
not know unless you stay away and see it

00:48:40.687 --> 00:48:42.321
So do not invlove in it .

00:48:42.433 --> 00:48:46.265
And the society that will be created
by chance, That's the true quality

00:48:47.163 --> 00:48:52.366
He is a true sahajayogi and he will
be blessed with this great work

00:48:53.001 --> 00:48:56.310
May god bless you .

00:49:16.585 --> 00:49:19.260
Gulal etc ...

00:49:26.890 --> 00:49:30.096
Should get some communication back

00:49:30.572 --> 00:49:32.548
One i think that people

00:49:32.667 --> 00:49:34.572
From pune going to mumbai

00:49:34.709 --> 00:49:38.892
Mumbains,Punein,from
there,from nagar

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:42.638
This,This and the lane in
it, do not remove

00:49:44.383 --> 00:49:49.353
Everyone should meet,Should be in
You must increase love with yourself

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:53.586
Everyone has given
such a suggestion that

00:49:53.919 --> 00:49:55.610
It would be good for man

00:49:56.848 --> 00:49:59.213
And everyone should travel

00:49:59.237 --> 00:50:01.763
You must meet here and there

00:50:01.993 --> 00:50:03.993
Which today

00:50:04.365 --> 00:50:05.334
Sahajayoga

00:50:05.437 --> 00:50:08.789
It has spread to foreign countries.
Sahajayogi there due to it,Not mi

00:50:10.503 --> 00:50:13.450
Because I do not have so much
time, my home is there

00:50:13.759 --> 00:50:20.490
My husband ia there,So much so Month out of
my tour, Soon there are 14 countries to go

00:50:20.767 --> 00:50:23.177
So I live in a country
for 2 to 3 days

00:50:23.899 --> 00:50:27.562
But these people came here to
themselves, go there from there

00:50:27.728 --> 00:50:31.307
Go and talk to them Make
arrangements everywhere

00:50:31.347 --> 00:50:33.601
It does not matter that there are
four psyche sitting at one place

00:50:36.592 --> 00:50:41.252
People of Pune go to four places It is
necessary to go out and talk to people only

00:50:41.633 --> 00:50:44.244
But you sit in one place
There is a big problem

00:50:44.696 --> 00:50:48.468
So it should be taken into mind
That should come among themselves

00:50:48.889 --> 00:50:54.289
And when you get in touch,
It should be done as well for sahajayogi

00:50:54.598 --> 00:50:55.833
Only then will it work

00:50:57.539 --> 00:51:01.508
But that does not mean many people,
Let's know some of that and try to mess it

00:51:01.642 --> 00:51:05.315
Mother said,Then they
go with their bed

00:51:06.013 --> 00:51:09.609
And whose house a month has
stopped He came to and crying

00:51:11.323 --> 00:51:15.974
Hey Mataji stayed for a month,Now
what to do? then you said it only.

00:51:17.482 --> 00:51:19.682
Self-respect i said

00:51:20.094 --> 00:51:23.753
There is no need to stay with anyone
Do it yourself and arrange somewhere

00:51:24.086 --> 00:51:27.069
You have two days to go and
meet and ask how you are?

00:51:27.094 --> 00:51:30.242
What's not?, what to do with the
program, and what to do

00:51:31.154 --> 00:51:33.154
Now move on
