1
00:00:01,107 --> 00:00:07,169
It is good that all Sahaja Yogis have come together.

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:15,053
When we meet like this, we can discuss many things of mutual interest

3
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:20,922
and tell even small details about them to each other

4
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:24,927
how to clean yourself as your Mother’s name itself is Nirmala

5
00:00:25,007 --> 00:00:29,952
and it contains many powers.

6
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:34,151
The first word is NIH which means not.

7
00:00:34,232 --> 00:00:40,291
Something that actually does not exist but appears to exist,

8
00:00:40,397 --> 00:00:45,850
is called Mahamaya (illusion).

9
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:50,984
In fact it is not there but we feel it exists

10
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:57,200
and this is called Mahamaya and the whole world is like that.

11
00:00:57,281 --> 00:01:00,981
It is seen but it is not true:

12
00:01:01,101 --> 00:01:09,133
if we are trapped into it we feel that it is the only thing we have to live for.

13
00:01:09,213 --> 00:01:14,454
Then we feel that economic conditions are unsatisfactory,

14
00:01:14,534 --> 00:01:20,100
social and domestic (family) conditions are bad,

15
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:26,127
everything around us is bad and we cannot see anything good.

16
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:31,849
Water on the sea surface is very dirty and turbid.

17
00:01:32,015 --> 00:01:35,711
Many objects are seen floating on it.

18
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:42,285
But if we go deep into the sea there is so much beauty, wealth and power

19
00:01:42,365 --> 00:01:47,330
that we forget that on the surface the water is so bad.

20
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:53,235
The point is that everything that you see around is illusion.

21
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:56,832
You must remember first of all it is all nothing.

22
00:01:56,917 --> 00:02:03,534
If you have to establish ‘NIH’ you have to tell yourself,

23
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,740
whenever a thought comes, say “not this

24
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,678
(ya neti neti vachane nigamor avochus)

25
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:17,455
another thought comes, say it is not there.

26
00:02:17,536 --> 00:02:21,902
You have to say this again and again.

27
00:02:21,982 --> 00:02:28,678
Then you will understand the meaning of word ‘NIH’.

28
00:02:31,345 --> 00:02:36,940
The illusion that you see is not just the illusion,

29
00:02:38,436 --> 00:02:42,921
but there is something beyond that.

30
00:02:43,127 --> 00:02:49,270
However, we have wasted so many years of lives in these illusions

31
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:55,650
that we give importance to all that actually does not exist

32
00:02:55,743 --> 00:03:00,436
and in doing that we have made heaps of sins.

33
00:03:00,517 --> 00:03:06,047
We have tried to derive the pleasure from many things.

34
00:03:06,128 --> 00:03:14,752
We have received nothing from whatever we have tried to enjoy.

35
00:03:15,965 --> 00:03:21,195
Essentially, it is all nothing – tasteless.

36
00:03:21,275 --> 00:03:30,029
So, the outlook should be, it is all that nothing, it is all false.

37
00:03:32,177 --> 00:03:36,770
Only Brahma is real the rest all is false.

38
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:39,815
You have to adopt this view point everywhere in life.

39
00:03:39,896 --> 00:03:43,037
Then you will understand the true meaning of Sahaja Yoga.

40
00:03:43,117 --> 00:03:46,935
What happens with most of the Sahaja Yogis after realisation, is that they think,

41
00:03:47,016 --> 00:03:50,796
“now that we are realised we have Mataji’s blessings.

42
00:03:51,836 --> 00:03:54,922
Then why are we not prosperous?”.

43
00:03:55,348 --> 00:04:01,508
That means they think God is in the prosperity.

44
00:04:01,914 --> 00:04:07,961
Inspite of having our realization why our family conditions do not improve?

45
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:13,526
Instead, you should think that, inspite of the realization

46
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:17,900
why my temperament (swabhav) has not changed.

47
00:04:17,981 --> 00:04:25,247
Then you’ll realise that my swabhav has not changed.

48
00:04:25,328 --> 00:04:29,801
See, how beautiful is this word ‘Swabhav’

49
00:04:29,882 --> 00:04:34,230
– ‘Swa’ is Atman i.e. the spirit and bhav is the nature.

50
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:37,142
Have you become the nature of your Self ?

51
00:04:37,223 --> 00:04:40,797
If you become your self there is so much beauty within,

52
00:04:40,878 --> 00:04:46,120
that all that goes on outside would appear like drama.

53
00:04:46,201 --> 00:04:51,197
So long as this witness state is not fully awakened within you,

54
00:04:51,277 --> 00:04:54,924
you have not followed the word ‘NIH’ and also you have not practised it.

55
00:04:55,005 --> 00:05:00,395
Suppose you are aware that you have not established ‘NIH’ within you

56
00:05:00,476 --> 00:05:04,145
and even now you become s emotional or egoistical,

57
00:05:04,225 --> 00:05:07,608
coercive or submissive and feel sad about it,

58
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:11,247
then the state of being on ‘NIH’ is at the centre of these extremes.

59
00:05:11,934 --> 00:05:14,740
You are neither in this state nor in that.

60
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,186
This state has to be established and it can be best achieved in meditation.

61
00:05:19,267 --> 00:05:23,986
Just by following the idea of ‘NIH’ in your life you will become (Nirvichar) thoughtless.

62
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:27,240
First of all, you should become thoughtless.

63
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,757
Once you start jumping on a thought however good or bad it may be,

64
00:05:30,837 --> 00:05:32,874
you go into some sort of inertia

65
00:05:32,954 --> 00:05:35,715
and in that state you jump from one thought to another.

66
00:05:35,795 --> 00:05:42,511
So some people have said that a bad thought should be opposed by a good thought.

67
00:05:42,591 --> 00:05:48,381
In other words if a vehicle or train coming from one direction,

68
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:53,963
is pushed back by another one, both will stop somewhere at the centre.

69
00:05:54,043 --> 00:05:57,831
It is good but occasionally it can become harmful.

70
00:05:57,911 --> 00:06:01,958
A bad thought when put down by a good thought remains suppressed

71
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:07,011
but it can suddenly come up and it happens with many people.

72
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:12,345
They press down their normal thoughts and always tell themselves

73
00:06:12,426 --> 00:06:17,030
that they must be good to others and must be well behaved etc.

74
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:22,451
These people can sometimes be in trouble.

75
00:06:22,532 --> 00:06:29,470
Suddenly they get exasperated and others cannot understand,

76
00:06:29,551 --> 00:06:36,361
why these well behaved people are annoyed.

77
00:06:36,826 --> 00:06:43,132
Also they lose their inner peace.

78
00:06:43,358 --> 00:06:53,987
All the beauty within them is destroyed. So we should be always thoughtless.

79
00:06:54,068 --> 00:07:00,105
Ban all thoughts from your mind

80
00:07:00,581 --> 00:07:07,664
and then you would automatically remain at the centre in the Vilamba.

81
00:07:09,043 --> 00:07:13,476
You must make all efforts. Now you would ask

82
00:07:13,562 --> 00:07:18,079
“Mother how can we do anything without thinking?”

83
00:07:19,631 --> 00:07:24,173
But what are thoughts? They are hollow.

84
00:07:24,293 --> 00:07:28,881
In thoughtless state you are one with the God’s power

85
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:34,688
that is, the drop, which is you, comes in the ocean which is God.

86
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:38,423
Hence His power also comes to you.

87
00:07:38,503 --> 00:07:43,026
Does this finger think? Is it not still moving?

88
00:07:43,107 --> 00:07:48,011
Give your thoughts to God and ask Him to think about you.

89
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:54,327
But it is rather difficult, because you are not thoughtless.

90
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:59,032
Many people say “we have surrendered everything”,

91
00:07:59,113 --> 00:08:04,488
but it does not happen because they do it only in talking.

92
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:07,707
Surrendering is not just talking.

93
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:13,410
When you attain thoughtlessness then surrendering is automatic .

94
00:08:13,491 --> 00:08:16,237
That is you have stopped thinking.

95
00:08:16,318 --> 00:08:19,738
When you stop thinking you come to the centre.

96
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:25,628
When at the centre, immediately you go into thoughtless awareness, i.e. become one with God’s power

97
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:29,695
and when you are one with the God’s power, He looks after you.

98
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:33,673
He takes care of your small things also. You will be amazed.

99
00:08:33,754 --> 00:08:37,609
Sometimes try doing things on your own.

100
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:44,861
Then you’ll experience “Sankalpa vikalpa karoti” (Man proposes and God disposes).

101
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:50,499
If you want to go through a particular way, try doing it.

102
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,722
All the countries have tried it and failed.

103
00:08:54,803 --> 00:08:59,511
It is worth trying and after that you will realise

104
00:08:59,591 --> 00:09:03,851
that what you were doing earlier was wrong.

105
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:12,477
So once you are in thoughtlessness you will get all inspirations,

106
00:09:12,558 --> 00:09:17,269
all powers and everything.

107
00:09:22,554 --> 00:09:28,370
The idea that you get in thoughtlessness is an inspiration.

108
00:09:28,451 --> 00:09:31,537
You will be surprised.

109
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:35,962
Everything will come to you as if on a plate.

110
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:39,286
You are standing to give a speech.

111
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:41,402
Just be thoughtless and start.

112
00:09:41,489 --> 00:09:49,016
Although you have never given a speech earlier or do not even know how to do it

113
00:09:49,097 --> 00:09:55,464
or have no special knowledge of any subject, you will speak so well

114
00:09:55,545 --> 00:10:01,348
that others will be astonished how you know so much.

115
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:05,909
But once you are deep in the thoughtless state,

116
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:11,205
all comes from there and not from your brain.

117
00:10:11,505 --> 00:10:14,460
I tell you about Me. You pray:

118
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:19,828
‘Mother kindly see that such and such happens to me’

119
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:24,126
and I do not think about that.

120
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:29,331
It is amazing. I put all that in the thoughtlessness.

121
00:10:29,412 --> 00:10:32,674
All machinery is working there. J

122
00:10:32,755 --> 00:10:37,755
ust put it to that machinery and it is all ready.

123
00:10:37,836 --> 00:10:42,164
Allow that machinery, you can call it silent machinery, to work.

124
00:10:42,245 --> 00:10:45,648
You should put all your problems to it.

125
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:49,616
But it is very difficult for intellectuals

126
00:10:49,697 --> 00:10:54,408
because their habit is to go on thinking about everything.

127
00:10:54,489 --> 00:10:58,915
You should be able to go into thoughtlessness

128
00:11:01,268 --> 00:11:05,363
while trying to understand a subject.

129
00:11:05,443 --> 00:11:08,127
All becomes clear automatically.

130
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:13,711
Research that you are doing should also be in thoughtless state.

131
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:18,183
Let your hands work while you are thoughtless.

132
00:11:18,264 --> 00:11:22,477
You can do your research extremely well in this way. I tell you many things.

133
00:11:22,665 --> 00:11:26,407
I have never read science in my life and know nothing about it.

134
00:11:26,487 --> 00:11:31,164
Still I tell you all that. Where does all the knowledge come from?

135
00:11:31,245 --> 00:11:35,667
From the thoughtlessness; I only speak and see all that is going on.

136
00:11:35,748 --> 00:11:38,854
It was all kept ready in that computer which is speaking.

137
00:11:38,934 --> 00:11:41,067
If you are not in the thoughtless state

138
00:11:41,147 --> 00:11:45,861
you do not use your computer and put your brain on top of it.

139
00:11:45,948 --> 00:11:51,510
It is such on old computer and lot of accurate work has been done on it.

140
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:56,048
You are bound to make mistakes if you use your own brain

141
00:11:56,128 --> 00:12:00,554
and do not consult the computer. It has no meaning.

142
00:12:00,747 --> 00:12:04,296
Thus the solution for all this is the prefix “PRA”.

143
00:12:04,376 --> 00:12:10,924
We say PRASHIKSHAN (Enlightened Education) in which we use the suffix PRA.

144
00:12:11,005 --> 00:12:16,352
[Ndlr – Whenever prefix “PRA” is used (in Sanskrit, Hindi or Marathi) it means enlightened].

145
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:21,871
All that happens in the thoughtless state is enlightened and thus is PRA.

146
00:12:21,951 --> 00:12:26,262
It is so PRACHANDA (Enormous) – here again it is PRA.

147
00:12:26,342 --> 00:12:30,614
Some other words are PRAKASHIT (brought to light),

148
00:12:30,695 --> 00:12:36,047
PRADNYA (wise), where we use the prefix PRA meaning enlightened.

149
00:12:36,128 --> 00:12:40,650
Light never talks. If you switch on the light in the room,

150
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:44,267
the light won’t speak or give you any ideas.

151
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,552
It would just make everything visible.

152
00:12:47,632 --> 00:12:53,131
Same is about the light of thoughtlessness.

153
00:12:53,211 --> 00:12:59,138
That ‘NIH’ is common in all such words like ‘Nirvichar’ (thoughtless),

154
00:12:59,218 --> 00:13:08,836
Nirvajya (Selfless), Nirahankar (egoless), Nirakar (formless).

155
00:13:08,917 --> 00:13:13,074
Thus lots of words come from the prefix NIH.

156
00:13:13,154 --> 00:13:20,335
You establish it and then you come into Nirvikalpa (doubtless state).

157
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:26,452
First become thoughtless and then doubtless (Nirvikalpa).

158
00:13:26,532 --> 00:13:32,113
Then all your doubts go and you know that there is some power that works.

159
00:13:32,193 --> 00:13:37,484
It works very fast and is all subtle. You will be amazed how it happens.

160
00:13:37,564 --> 00:13:41,647
This is also about time. I never see watch.

161
00:13:41,727 --> 00:13:47,582
Sometimes it stops and shows, when the time is 3.00 o’clock.

162
00:13:47,662 --> 00:13:50,930
Just to show others I wind my watch.

163
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:57,284
But my real watch is in the thoughtlessness. It is permanently stopped.

164
00:13:57,364 --> 00:14:03,200
If anything is to be done, it takes place at the right time.

165
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:08,301
Then there are no regrets whether it is late or not.

166
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:11,094
Whatever it may be I am where I am.

167
00:14:11,175 --> 00:14:17,720
Yesterday, my car failed but I was relaxing because I wanted to see the stars.

168
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:22,733
That beauty is not visible in London and I wanted to see it.

169
00:14:22,813 --> 00:14:25,786
Thus I was enjoying the starlit night.

170
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:30,206
Others were worried and they started giving vibrations (bandhans).

171
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,652
I told them, why are you wasting your vibrations?

172
00:14:33,732 --> 00:14:37,964
See the stars which you do not watch often. I had to see the beauty in the sky.

173
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:40,531
Its splendour was spread all over the sky.

174
00:14:40,612 --> 00:14:43,438
The sky thought Mataji should see it also

175
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,602
because (it thinks) She always Her attention only on Sahaja yogis.

176
00:14:46,683 --> 00:14:49,049
I wanted to get down and watch it but I was worried

177
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,247
that the Sahaja yogis might think that I am in trouble.

178
00:14:52,328 --> 00:14:55,448
So I was just watching the sky from where I was and enjoying it.

179
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:58,426
In short, you should not be a slave of anything.

180
00:14:58,507 --> 00:15:05,391
If you are thoughtless God takes you everywhere as if on his hands.

181
00:15:05,618 --> 00:15:07,685
He makes all arrangements.

182
00:15:07,852 --> 00:15:12,484
He knows everything and there is no need to tell him about anything.

183
00:15:12,565 --> 00:15:16,910
But you must see whether you are in the PRAVAHA (main stream) or not.

184
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,720
You should see if you are in God’s Pravaha.

185
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,651
If you are not in it then you are stuck up somewhere on the bank;

186
00:15:24,744 --> 00:15:28,845
then current comes and takes you in, twice or thrice

187
00:15:28,925 --> 00:15:30,849
but again you are on the bank.

188
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:35,661
Then you say ‘Mataji, nothing goes smoothly for me’. It won’t.

189
00:15:40,428 --> 00:15:42,619
Because you are entangled.

190
00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:48,097
Shri Ganesha’s praise that you sing is excellent. It says,

191
00:15:48,424 --> 00:15:51,388
PADTA PRAVAHI “flowing in the main stream (Pravaha)”

192
00:15:51,468 --> 00:15:54,678
which means enlightened main stream.

193
00:15:54,758 --> 00:15:57,797
We should swim in the pravaha.

194
00:15:57,877 --> 00:16:01,631
You should not bring your own separate, current in it.

195
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:04,350
Pravaha also means enlightened vehicle.

196
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:12,841
The Arti of Shri Ganesha also says ‘Nirvani Rakshave’, i.e. protect me when I am dying. Y

197
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:17,058
ou also pray ‘Raksha Raksha Parameshwara’

198
00:16:17,138 --> 00:16:19,935
O God protect me, but you want to protect yourself.

199
00:16:20,015 --> 00:16:26,111
Why should, then, God protect you? He says, “let him protect himself.”

200
00:16:26,217 --> 00:16:32,978
Then you have all the sufferings of the world upon you like big mountains.

201
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:39,324
I feel like laughing. These are all like balloons. They have no meaning.

202
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:47,607
What I want to emphasise is that you must learn to go deep within yourself

203
00:16:47,688 --> 00:16:52,837
and realise all this in the thoughtlessness then you can become Nirvikalpa (doubtless).

204
00:16:52,918 --> 00:16:56,246
You should attain Nirasaktata – Asaktata means attachments.

205
00:16:56,327 --> 00:16:58,602
You must have no attachment (Nirasakta).

206
00:16:58,683 --> 00:17:00,902
We have here, (India) ‘my son, my daughter’.

207
00:17:00,983 --> 00:17:02,803
In England, it is just the opposite.

208
00:17:02,903 --> 00:17:07,328
There, they are not attached to son or daughter.

209
00:17:07,408 --> 00:17:10,358
They are worried only about themselves.

210
00:17:10,438 --> 00:17:14,075
Son is left to the dogs. They even kill their children.

211
00:17:14,155 --> 00:17:17,408
Some might not believe it but they kill.

212
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:21,411
Each week a mother kills two children. They are so cruel.

213
00:17:21,731 --> 00:17:29,676
Here you have this attachment; my son, my daughter, my husband, my house etc.,

214
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:36,061
everything is mine and at the end your “self” is left out!

215
00:17:36,361 --> 00:17:42,401
You should say “Nothing is mine and everything is yours.”

216
00:17:43,205 --> 00:17:49,524
Kabir says “so long as a goat is alive it is bleating ‘main, main’ (I, I)

217
00:17:49,605 --> 00:17:54,639
but when it is slaughtered there is no life left,

218
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,795
she realizes that I spent my whole life in saying “main, main”.

219
00:17:58,876 --> 00:18:02,601
Those whom I called mine have turned out to be useless

220
00:18:06,614 --> 00:18:12,785
– everybody in the family, in the house –

221
00:18:12,955 --> 00:18:20,230
all those whom I considered to be mine have turned out to be useless.

222
00:18:20,357 --> 00:18:27,439
They themselves killed me and ate. Then it realizes it’s mistake.

223
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,486
Then someone creates taut strings of its guts

224
00:18:33,597 --> 00:18:37,076
and fixes them on an musical instrument.

225
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:41,096
When these strings are pulled they make a sound “Toohie, Toohie”

226
00:18:41,176 --> 00:18:47,972
(you alone are.) You must become like that.

227
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:53,530
Once you are established in the idea I am nought, I have no existence,

228
00:18:53,611 --> 00:18:58,489
then only you will understand the word ‘NIH’.
