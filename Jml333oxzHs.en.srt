1
00:00:08,107 --> 00:00:14,169
It is good that all Sahaja Yogis have come together.

2
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:22,053
When we meet like this, we can discuss many things of mutual interest

3
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,922
and tell even small details about them to each other

4
00:00:28,002 --> 00:00:31,927
how to clean yourself as your Mother’s name itself is Nirmala

5
00:00:32,007 --> 00:00:36,952
and it contains many powers.

6
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:41,151
The first word is NIH which means not.

7
00:00:41,232 --> 00:00:47,291
Something that actually does not exist but appears to exist,

8
00:00:47,397 --> 00:00:52,850
is called Mahamaya (illusion).

9
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:57,984
In fact it is not there but we feel it exists

10
00:00:58,584 --> 00:01:04,200
and this is called Mahamaya and the whole world is like that.

11
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:07,981
It is seen but it is not true:

12
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:16,133
if we are trapped into it we feel that it is the only thing we have to live for.

13
00:01:16,213 --> 00:01:21,454
Then we feel that economic conditions are unsatisfactory,

14
00:01:21,534 --> 00:01:27,100
social and domestic (family) conditions are bad,

15
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:33,127
everything around us is bad and we cannot see anything good.

16
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:38,849
Water on the sea surface is very dirty and turbid.

17
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:42,711
Many objects are seen floating on it.

18
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:49,285
But if we go deep into the sea there is so much beauty, wealth and power

19
00:01:49,365 --> 00:01:54,330
that we forget that on the surface the water is so bad.

20
00:01:54,411 --> 00:02:00,235
The point is that everything that you see around is illusion.

21
00:02:00,322 --> 00:02:03,832
You must remember first of all it is all nothing.

22
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:10,534
If you have to establish ‘NIH’ you have to tell yourself,

23
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,740
whenever a thought comes, say “not this

24
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,678
(ya neti neti vachane nigamor avochus)

25
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,455
another thought comes, say it is not there.

26
00:02:24,536 --> 00:02:28,902
You have to say this again and again.

27
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:35,678
Then you will understand the meaning of word ‘NIH’.

28
00:02:38,345 --> 00:02:43,940
The illusion that you see is not just the illusion,

29
00:02:45,436 --> 00:02:49,921
but there is something beyond that.

30
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:56,270
However, we have wasted so many years of lives in these illusions

31
00:02:56,351 --> 00:03:02,650
that we give importance to all that actually does not exist

32
00:03:02,743 --> 00:03:07,436
and in doing that we have made heaps of sins.

33
00:03:07,517 --> 00:03:13,047
We have tried to derive the pleasure from many things.

34
00:03:13,128 --> 00:03:21,752
We have received nothing from whatever we have tried to enjoy.

35
00:03:22,965 --> 00:03:28,195
Essentially, it is all nothing – tasteless.

36
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:37,029
So, the outlook should be, it is all that nothing, it is all false.

37
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:43,770
Only Brahma is real the rest all is false.

38
00:03:43,851 --> 00:03:46,815
You have to adopt this view point everywhere in life.

39
00:03:46,896 --> 00:03:50,037
Then you will understand the true meaning of Sahaja Yoga.

40
00:03:50,117 --> 00:03:53,935
What happens with most of the Sahaja Yogis after realisation, is that they think,

41
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:57,796
“now that we are realised we have Mataji’s blessings.

42
00:03:58,836 --> 00:04:01,922
Then why are we not prosperous?”.

43
00:04:02,348 --> 00:04:08,508
That means they think God is in the prosperity.

44
00:04:08,914 --> 00:04:14,961
Inspite of having our realization why our family conditions do not improve?

45
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:20,526
Instead, you should think that, inspite of the realization

46
00:04:20,654 --> 00:04:24,900
why my temperament (swabhav) has not changed.

47
00:04:24,981 --> 00:04:32,247
Then you’ll realise that my swabhav has not changed.

48
00:04:32,328 --> 00:04:36,801
See, how beautiful is this word ‘Swabhav’

49
00:04:36,882 --> 00:04:41,230
– ‘Swa’ is Atman i.e. the spirit and bhav is the nature.

50
00:04:41,311 --> 00:04:44,142
Have you become the nature of your Self ?

51
00:04:44,223 --> 00:04:47,797
If you become your self there is so much beauty within,

52
00:04:47,878 --> 00:04:53,120
that all that goes on outside would appear like drama.

53
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:58,197
So long as this witness state is not fully awakened within you,

54
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:01,924
you have not followed the word ‘NIH’ and also you have not practised it.

55
00:05:02,005 --> 00:05:07,395
Suppose you are aware that you have not established ‘NIH’ within you

56
00:05:07,476 --> 00:05:11,145
and even now you become s emotional or egoistical,

57
00:05:11,225 --> 00:05:14,608
coercive or submissive and feel sad about it,

58
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:18,247
then the state of being on ‘NIH’ is at the centre of these extremes.

59
00:05:18,934 --> 00:05:21,740
You are neither in this state nor in that.

60
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,186
This state has to be established and it can be best achieved in meditation.

61
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:30,986
Just by following the idea of ‘NIH’ in your life you will become (Nirvichar) thoughtless.

62
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:34,240
First of all, you should become thoughtless.

63
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,757
Once you start jumping on a thought however good or bad it may be,

64
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,874
you go into some sort of inertia

65
00:05:39,954 --> 00:05:42,715
and in that state you jump from one thought to another.

66
00:05:42,795 --> 00:05:49,511
So some people have said that a bad thought should be opposed by a good thought.

67
00:05:49,591 --> 00:05:55,381
In other words if a vehicle or train coming from one direction,

68
00:05:55,461 --> 00:06:00,963
is pushed back by another one, both will stop somewhere at the centre.

69
00:06:01,043 --> 00:06:04,831
It is good but occasionally it can become harmful.

70
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:08,958
A bad thought when put down by a good thought remains suppressed

71
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:14,011
but it can suddenly come up and it happens with many people.

72
00:06:14,092 --> 00:06:19,345
They press down their normal thoughts and always tell themselves

73
00:06:19,426 --> 00:06:24,030
that they must be good to others and must be well behaved etc.

74
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:29,451
These people can sometimes be in trouble.

75
00:06:29,532 --> 00:06:36,470
Suddenly they get exasperated and others cannot understand,

76
00:06:36,551 --> 00:06:43,361
why these well behaved people are annoyed.

77
00:06:43,826 --> 00:06:50,132
Also they lose their inner peace.

78
00:06:50,358 --> 00:07:00,987
All the beauty within them is destroyed. So we should be always thoughtless.

79
00:07:01,068 --> 00:07:07,105
Ban all thoughts from your mind

80
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:14,664
and then you would automatically remain at the centre in the Vilamba.

81
00:07:16,043 --> 00:07:20,476
You must make all efforts. Now you would ask

82
00:07:20,562 --> 00:07:25,079
“Mother how can we do anything without thinking?”

83
00:07:26,631 --> 00:07:31,173
But what are thoughts? They are hollow.

84
00:07:31,293 --> 00:07:35,881
In thoughtless state you are one with the God’s power

85
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:41,688
that is, the drop, which is you, comes in the ocean which is God.

86
00:07:41,768 --> 00:07:45,423
Hence His power also comes to you.

87
00:07:45,503 --> 00:07:50,026
Does this finger think? Is it not still moving?

88
00:07:50,107 --> 00:07:55,011
Give your thoughts to God and ask Him to think about you.

89
00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:01,327
But it is rather difficult, because you are not thoughtless.

90
00:08:01,408 --> 00:08:06,032
Many people say “we have surrendered everything”,

91
00:08:06,113 --> 00:08:11,488
but it does not happen because they do it only in talking.

92
00:08:11,568 --> 00:08:14,707
Surrendering is not just talking.

93
00:08:14,788 --> 00:08:20,410
When you attain thoughtlessness then surrendering is automatic .

94
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:23,237
That is you have stopped thinking.

95
00:08:23,318 --> 00:08:26,738
When you stop thinking you come to the centre.

96
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:32,628
When at the centre, immediately you go into thoughtless awareness, i.e. become one with God’s power

97
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:36,695
and when you are one with the God’s power, He looks after you.

98
00:08:36,776 --> 00:08:40,673
He takes care of your small things also. You will be amazed.

99
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:44,609
Sometimes try doing things on your own.

100
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:51,861
Then you’ll experience “Sankalpa vikalpa karoti” (Man proposes and God disposes).

101
00:08:51,942 --> 00:08:57,499
If you want to go through a particular way, try doing it.

102
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,722
All the countries have tried it and failed.

103
00:09:01,803 --> 00:09:06,511
It is worth trying and after that you will realise

104
00:09:06,591 --> 00:09:10,851
that what you were doing earlier was wrong.

105
00:09:10,931 --> 00:09:19,477
So once you are in thoughtlessness you will get all inspirations,

106
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:24,269
all powers and everything.

107
00:09:29,554 --> 00:09:35,370
The idea that you get in thoughtlessness is an inspiration.

108
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:38,537
You will be surprised.

109
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:42,962
Everything will come to you as if on a plate.

110
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:46,286
You are standing to give a speech.

111
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:48,402
Just be thoughtless and start.

112
00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:56,016
Although you have never given a speech earlier or do not even know how to do it

113
00:09:56,097 --> 00:10:02,464
or have no special knowledge of any subject, you will speak so well

114
00:10:02,545 --> 00:10:08,348
that others will be astonished how you know so much.

115
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:12,909
But once you are deep in the thoughtless state,

116
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:18,205
all comes from there and not from your brain.

117
00:10:18,505 --> 00:10:21,460
I tell you about Me. You pray:

118
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:26,828
‘Mother kindly see that such and such happens to me’

119
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:31,126
and I do not think about that.

120
00:10:31,206 --> 00:10:36,331
It is amazing. I put all that in the thoughtlessness.

121
00:10:36,412 --> 00:10:39,674
All machinery is working there. J

122
00:10:39,755 --> 00:10:44,755
ust put it to that machinery and it is all ready.

123
00:10:44,836 --> 00:10:49,164
Allow that machinery, you can call it silent machinery, to work.

124
00:10:49,245 --> 00:10:52,648
You should put all your problems to it.

125
00:10:52,729 --> 00:10:56,616
But it is very difficult for intellectuals

126
00:10:56,697 --> 00:11:01,408
because their habit is to go on thinking about everything.

127
00:11:01,489 --> 00:11:05,915
You should be able to go into thoughtlessness

128
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:12,363
while trying to understand a subject.

129
00:11:12,443 --> 00:11:15,127
All becomes clear automatically.

130
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:20,711
Research that you are doing should also be in thoughtless state.

131
00:11:20,792 --> 00:11:25,183
Let your hands work while you are thoughtless.

132
00:11:25,264 --> 00:11:29,477
You can do your research extremely well in this way. I tell you many things.

133
00:11:29,665 --> 00:11:33,407
I have never read science in my life and know nothing about it.

134
00:11:33,487 --> 00:11:38,164
Still I tell you all that. Where does all the knowledge come from?

135
00:11:38,245 --> 00:11:42,667
From the thoughtlessness; I only speak and see all that is going on.

136
00:11:42,748 --> 00:11:45,854
It was all kept ready in that computer which is speaking.

137
00:11:45,934 --> 00:11:48,067
If you are not in the thoughtless state

138
00:11:48,147 --> 00:11:52,861
you do not use your computer and put your brain on top of it.

139
00:11:52,948 --> 00:11:58,510
It is such on old computer and lot of accurate work has been done on it.

140
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:03,048
You are bound to make mistakes if you use your own brain

141
00:12:03,128 --> 00:12:07,554
and do not consult the computer. It has no meaning.

142
00:12:07,747 --> 00:12:11,296
Thus the solution for all this is the prefix “PRA”.

143
00:12:11,376 --> 00:12:17,924
We say PRASHIKSHAN (Enlightened Education) in which we use the suffix PRA.

144
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:23,352
[Ndlr – Whenever prefix “PRA” is used (in Sanskrit, Hindi or Marathi) it means enlightened].

145
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:28,871
All that happens in the thoughtless state is enlightened and thus is PRA.

146
00:12:28,951 --> 00:12:33,262
It is so PRACHANDA (Enormous) – here again it is PRA.

147
00:12:33,342 --> 00:12:37,614
Some other words are PRAKASHIT (brought to light),

148
00:12:37,695 --> 00:12:43,047
PRADNYA (wise), where we use the prefix PRA meaning enlightened.

149
00:12:43,128 --> 00:12:47,650
Light never talks. If you switch on the light in the room,

150
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:51,267
the light won’t speak or give you any ideas.

151
00:12:51,347 --> 00:12:54,552
It would just make everything visible.

152
00:12:54,632 --> 00:13:00,131
Same is about the light of thoughtlessness.

153
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:06,138
That ‘NIH’ is common in all such words like ‘Nirvichar’ (thoughtless),

154
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:15,836
Nirvajya (Selfless), Nirahankar (egoless), Nirakar (formless).

155
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:20,074
Thus lots of words come from the prefix NIH.

156
00:13:20,154 --> 00:13:27,335
You establish it and then you come into Nirvikalpa (doubtless state).

157
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:33,452
First become thoughtless and then doubtless (Nirvikalpa).

158
00:13:33,532 --> 00:13:39,113
Then all your doubts go and you know that there is some power that works.

159
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:44,484
It works very fast and is all subtle. You will be amazed how it happens.

160
00:13:44,564 --> 00:13:48,647
This is also about time. I never see watch.

161
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:54,582
Sometimes it stops and shows, when the time is 3.00 o’clock.

162
00:13:54,662 --> 00:13:57,930
Just to show others I wind my watch.

163
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:04,284
But my real watch is in the thoughtlessness. It is permanently stopped.

164
00:14:04,364 --> 00:14:10,200
If anything is to be done, it takes place at the right time.

165
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:15,301
Then there are no regrets whether it is late or not.

166
00:14:15,382 --> 00:14:18,094
Whatever it may be I am where I am.

167
00:14:18,175 --> 00:14:24,720
Yesterday, my car failed but I was relaxing because I wanted to see the stars.

168
00:14:24,801 --> 00:14:29,733
That beauty is not visible in London and I wanted to see it.

169
00:14:29,813 --> 00:14:32,786
Thus I was enjoying the starlit night.

170
00:14:32,867 --> 00:14:37,206
Others were worried and they started giving vibrations (bandhans).

171
00:14:37,286 --> 00:14:40,652
I told them, why are you wasting your vibrations?

172
00:14:40,732 --> 00:14:44,964
See the stars which you do not watch often. I had to see the beauty in the sky.

173
00:14:45,045 --> 00:14:47,531
Its splendour was spread all over the sky.

174
00:14:47,612 --> 00:14:50,438
The sky thought Mataji should see it also

175
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:53,602
because (it thinks) She always Her attention only on Sahaja yogis.

176
00:14:53,683 --> 00:14:56,049
I wanted to get down and watch it but I was worried

177
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,247
that the Sahaja yogis might think that I am in trouble.

178
00:14:59,328 --> 00:15:02,448
So I was just watching the sky from where I was and enjoying it.

179
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:05,426
In short, you should not be a slave of anything.

180
00:15:05,507 --> 00:15:12,391
If you are thoughtless God takes you everywhere as if on his hands.

181
00:15:12,618 --> 00:15:14,685
He makes all arrangements.

182
00:15:14,852 --> 00:15:19,484
He knows everything and there is no need to tell him about anything.

183
00:15:19,565 --> 00:15:23,910
But you must see whether you are in the PRAVAHA (main stream) or not.

184
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,720
You should see if you are in God’s Pravaha.

185
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,651
If you are not in it then you are stuck up somewhere on the bank;

186
00:15:31,744 --> 00:15:35,845
then current comes and takes you in, twice or thrice

187
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:37,849
but again you are on the bank.

188
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:42,661
Then you say ‘Mataji, nothing goes smoothly for me’. It won’t.

189
00:15:47,428 --> 00:15:49,619
Because you are entangled.

190
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:55,097
Shri Ganesha’s praise that you sing is excellent. It says,

191
00:15:55,424 --> 00:15:58,388
PADTA PRAVAHI “flowing in the main stream (Pravaha)”

192
00:15:58,468 --> 00:16:01,678
which means enlightened main stream.

193
00:16:01,758 --> 00:16:04,797
We should swim in the pravaha.

194
00:16:04,877 --> 00:16:08,631
You should not bring your own separate, current in it.

195
00:16:08,711 --> 00:16:11,350
Pravaha also means enlightened vehicle.

196
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:19,841
The Arti of Shri Ganesha also says ‘Nirvani Rakshave’, i.e. protect me when I am dying. Y

197
00:16:19,921 --> 00:16:24,058
ou also pray ‘Raksha Raksha Parameshwara’

198
00:16:24,138 --> 00:16:26,935
O God protect me, but you want to protect yourself.

199
00:16:27,015 --> 00:16:33,111
Why should, then, God protect you? He says, “let him protect himself.”

200
00:16:33,217 --> 00:16:39,978
Then you have all the sufferings of the world upon you like big mountains.

201
00:16:40,575 --> 00:16:46,324
I feel like laughing. These are all like balloons. They have no meaning.

202
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:54,607
What I want to emphasise is that you must learn to go deep within yourself

203
00:16:54,688 --> 00:16:59,837
and realise all this in the thoughtlessness then you can become Nirvikalpa (doubtless).

204
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:03,246
You should attain Nirasaktata – Asaktata means attachments.

205
00:17:03,327 --> 00:17:05,602
You must have no attachment (Nirasakta).

206
00:17:05,683 --> 00:17:07,902
We have here, (India) ‘my son, my daughter’.

207
00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:09,803
In England, it is just the opposite.

208
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:14,328
There, they are not attached to son or daughter.

209
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:17,358
They are worried only about themselves.

210
00:17:17,438 --> 00:17:21,075
Son is left to the dogs. They even kill their children.

211
00:17:21,155 --> 00:17:24,408
Some might not believe it but they kill.

212
00:17:24,661 --> 00:17:28,411
Each week a mother kills two children. They are so cruel.

213
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:36,676
Here you have this attachment; my son, my daughter, my husband, my house etc.,

214
00:17:36,757 --> 00:17:43,061
everything is mine and at the end your “self” is left out!

215
00:17:43,361 --> 00:17:49,401
You should say “Nothing is mine and everything is yours.”

216
00:17:50,205 --> 00:17:56,524
Kabir says “so long as a goat is alive it is bleating ‘main, main’ (I, I)

217
00:17:56,605 --> 00:18:01,639
but when it is slaughtered there is no life left,

218
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,795
she realizes that I spent my whole life in saying “main, main”.

219
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:09,601
Those whom I called mine have turned out to be useless

220
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:19,785
– everybody in the family, in the house –

221
00:18:19,955 --> 00:18:27,230
all those whom I considered to be mine have turned out to be useless.

222
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:34,439
They themselves killed me and ate. Then it realizes it’s mistake.

223
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:40,486
Then someone creates taut strings of its guts

224
00:18:40,597 --> 00:18:44,076
and fixes them on an musical instrument.

225
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:48,096
When these strings are pulled they make a sound “Toohie, Toohie”

226
00:18:48,176 --> 00:18:54,972
(you alone are.) You must become like that.

227
00:18:55,299 --> 00:19:00,530
Once you are established in the idea I am nought, I have no existence,

228
00:19:00,611 --> 00:19:05,489
then only you will understand the word ‘NIH’.
