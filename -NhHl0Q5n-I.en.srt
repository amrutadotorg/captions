1
00:00:00,967 --> 00:00:05,834


2
00:08:22,582 --> 00:08:32,248
Today is a very important day for all of us Sahaja Yogis,

3
00:08:32,282 --> 00:08:37,882
because today Shri Ganesha was born.

4
00:08:37,915 --> 00:08:43,782
Shri Ganesha is whom we worship

5
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:53,049
and because of whom we got our awakening (jagruti).

6
00:08:53,082 --> 00:08:56,615
However much you may remember Him,

7
00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:05,682
until you do not know His
 special qualities, you cannot attain Him.

8
00:09:05,715 --> 00:09:16,482
His special quality is that He is the embodiment
of purity (shuddha swaroop)

9
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:35,549
and complete Master of the Universe.

10
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:40,849
He is the incarnation of the Supreme, of Brahman.

11
00:09:40,882 --> 00:09:53,982
By coming into this world He has created music (sangeet),
rhythm (taal) and notes (sur).

12
00:09:54,015 --> 00:10:01,382
By His Grace only people become one with music
(talleen).

13
00:10:01,415 --> 00:10:10,248
A small boy who came into the world
and did such great work!

14
00:10:10,248 --> 00:10:18,849
He has given so many things to everyone
and even today He is active.

15
00:10:18,882 --> 00:10:23,415
Shri Ganesha’s Puja, no matter how much
you do it, it is not enough.

16
00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:41,582
A lot of people say we don’t see Shri Ganesha, even after
worshiping Him so much, we do not attain Him.

17
00:10:41,615 --> 00:10:49,615
He is omnipotent, omnipresent and in everything,

18
00:10:49,649 --> 00:11:01,782
but you cannot recognize Him until you are Realized.

19
00:11:01,815 --> 00:11:09,248
After your realization you can recognize what Shri Ganesha is.

20
00:11:09,282 --> 00:11:21,882
Shri Ganesha is Purity, the Pure Spirit.

21
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:33,549
When He is awakened within us,
then we have no questions left.

22
00:11:33,582 --> 00:11:41,415
Then we are successful, in whichever task we undertake.

23
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:47,715
We find joy in everything we do.

24
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:54,315
He is the embodiment of joy
and gives joy to everyone.

25
00:11:54,349 --> 00:12:00,182
To serve Him is the ultimate dharma (paramdharma).

26
00:12:00,215 --> 00:12:09,248
To serve Him means to look after small children, to serve
them,

27
00:12:09,282 --> 00:12:15,915
to protect them, to make sure there is no cruelty towards them.

28
00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:21,449
This pleases Him very much.

29
00:12:21,482 --> 00:12:32,715
Such an embodiment of love,
such a simple-hearted Shri Ganesha, was born today.

30
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:38,115
This is the importance of this day.

31
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:49,815
Today, if you ask for any wish, then Shri Ganesha will fulfill it.

32
00:12:49,849 --> 00:13:03,315
It is His right to fulfill all your desires,
because you are all realized.

33
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:14,949
Ask Him from all your heart, and He will help you in every way,
every moment, and every instant.

34
00:13:14,982 --> 00:13:18,749
Today is a very big day,

35
00:13:18,782 --> 00:13:25,615
because verily the pure Spirit itself has taken birth today.

36
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:34,615
And He already had such a spiritual, eternal state

37
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:38,449
that many people could not comprehend it or write about it.

38
00:13:38,482 --> 00:13:49,315
Many people didn’t tell anything;
they wrote only what they could understand.

39
00:13:49,349 --> 00:13:59,782
But you can understand that just
by Shri Ganesha’s name you get your realization.

40
00:13:59,815 --> 00:14:07,615
Just by taking His name,
any disease or any pain will disappear.

41
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:18,749
He is eternal.

42
00:14:18,782 --> 00:14:25,149
He is always present within us.

43
00:14:25,182 --> 00:14:33,149
When you get your realization, you can feel His presence.

44
00:14:33,182 --> 00:14:37,782
And if you are not realized, you cannot understand.

45
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:43,982
That is why people get misled and do wrong things.

46
00:14:44,015 --> 00:14:51,215
But with Shri Ganesha’s blessings, you can do so many things,

47
00:14:51,248 --> 00:14:58,815
and you won’t feel greedy nor have any problems,

48
00:14:58,849 --> 00:15:06,882
because He does all the work for you. He takes care of you.

49
00:15:06,915 --> 00:15:12,549
Though He is a little boy, He looks after you.

50
00:15:12,582 --> 00:15:15,849
It’s a tremendous power.

51
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:25,149
By Shri Ganesha’s power, several works are manifested.

52
00:15:25,182 --> 00:15:35,549
For Me, He is the purest ever and My own.

53
00:15:35,582 --> 00:15:40,282
I trouble Him a lot.

54
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:43,248
When somebody tries to trouble Me,

55
00:15:43,282 --> 00:15:49,449
I ask Him to handle this fellow and to make him alright.

56
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:54,915
When this fellow is not manageable by Me,
when there is a difficult person

57
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:57,515
and it is not possible for Me to handle him,
then He does the job.

58
00:15:57,549 --> 00:16:09,182
So today is very auspicious, as He was born this day.

59
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:14,282
Secondly, today is Panchami (the fifth day).

60
00:16:14,315 --> 00:16:30,182
This Panchami is recognized
because on this day we wear special clothes.

61
00:16:30,215 --> 00:16:41,915
Whatever we wear is so that our body is properly covered.

62
00:16:41,915 --> 00:16:54,749
The sense of chastity that our body has is because of Him;

63
00:16:54,782 --> 00:16:58,849
Lajja Rupena Samsthita
[the one who resides in the form of bashful modesty].

64
00:16:58,882 --> 00:17:07,715
So if you have any sense of chastity, it is because of Him.

65
00:17:07,749 --> 00:17:14,749
That will benefit you immensely.

66
00:17:14,782 --> 00:17:23,482
You cannot feel joyous until you worship Shri Ganesha.

67
00:17:23,515 --> 00:17:28,749
By worshipping Shri Ganesha, your joy increases.

68
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:36,582
You become joyous,
because He is the personification of joy [anand swaroop].

69
00:17:36,615 --> 00:17:51,615
Because of this, we have both things today:
His birthday and His help.

70
00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:59,782
We seek His help in any work we do. Such is our way.

71
00:17:59,815 --> 00:18:10,649
But we don’t see what we do to establish Him.
Our attention does not go in that direction.

72
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:15,382
That we should also do something,
that we should also develop our state,

73
00:18:15,382 --> 00:18:22,349
that we should have a state in which
Shri Ganesha is awakened within us,

74
00:18:22,382 --> 00:18:26,982
through which we may never venture on the wrong path.

75
00:18:27,015 --> 00:18:32,615
Those who are rooted in Ganesha are special.

76
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:42,349
They despise all the wrong things in this world,
and they do not do anything wrong,

77
00:18:42,382 --> 00:18:46,182
because Shri Ganesha stops them.

78
00:18:46,215 --> 00:18:50,315
They cannot enjoy wrong activities.

79
00:18:50,349 --> 00:19:01,515
This is Shri Ganesha’s great blessing,
that you have entered a new, joyous life.

80
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:09,749
So today in His service, in order to make him joyous,

81
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:17,015
sing His praise and glory, so that He may be pleased.

82
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:22,782
My eternal blessings to all of you.
