00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.100
﻿I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.140
Yesterday as I told you,

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.860
this is the knowledge of the roots.

00:01:44.196 --> 00:01:46.900
We have the knowledge of the tree.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.740
But if the tree grows and grows

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.340
and does not pay attention to its roots,

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.877
then there is always

00:02:08.317 --> 00:02:13.340
a definite stage where the tree gets destroyed.

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:27.467
So the destruction is not going to come to us

00:02:27.702 --> 00:02:29.702
from outside.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.580
It is going to work out from within ourselves.

00:02:39.788 --> 00:02:42.149
Through various diseases,

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.982
through various mishaps in our lives.

00:02:54.023 --> 00:02:57.946
It is important to see

00:02:58.146 --> 00:03:00.945
that you become the Spirit

00:03:01.146 --> 00:03:04.474
so that you will understand the mysteries of life.

00:03:13.453 --> 00:03:16.001
Even in the medical science

00:03:16.202 --> 00:03:19.780
there are many things which cannot be explained by them.

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:27.300
Or in any science

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.100
whatever theories are propounded are all the time challenged.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.311
They are not absolute.

00:03:39.605 --> 00:03:43.100
So there is something lacking in human awareness

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.441
that we are not at an absolute point.

00:03:51.697 --> 00:03:56.020
Now this beautiful arrangement is made within ourselves

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.100
during our evolutionary process.

00:04:05.552 --> 00:04:09.148
But when we go to the left or to the right,

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.796
to the extremes, then what happens,

00:04:12.996 --> 00:04:16.300
is that our centers which are like this,

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.502
get broken,

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.387
and we lose the connection with the whole.

00:04:32.283 --> 00:04:35.100
As a result of that we develop

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.931
diseases which are psychosomatic, may be physical,

00:04:39.131 --> 00:04:41.131
may be emotional.

00:04:46.598 --> 00:04:48.598
But the Kundalini,

00:04:49.002 --> 00:04:52.620
which is the vital force passes through the center

00:04:53.017 --> 00:04:56.740
and brings the broken centers together,

00:05:03.383 --> 00:05:06.500
and brings the attention in the center.

00:05:09.802 --> 00:05:13.440
When our attention is on the left or on the right,

00:05:13.641 --> 00:05:18.500
we go into different various funny experiences.

00:05:25.957 --> 00:05:28.889
Like when we go to the right side,

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.740
we feel as if our body is

00:05:33.415 --> 00:05:36.416
somewhere and we are flying in the air.

00:05:44.545 --> 00:05:47.629
This we call as supraconscious experiences.

00:05:50.858 --> 00:05:53.380
People start seeing the future,

00:05:53.873 --> 00:05:55.873
living in the future.

00:05:59.328 --> 00:06:02.260
But they do not know how it happens.

00:06:04.808 --> 00:06:06.814
They have no control over it.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.220
They have no scientific knowledge of it.

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:15.900
As if we are carried away by some force.

00:06:19.718 --> 00:06:22.900
On the left hand side if you move too much,

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.489
then you develop,

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.500
of course, horrible diseases which are psychosomatic.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.718
But also you become possessed by funny ideas

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:45.061
and you start jumping and gesticulating and

00:06:45.261 --> 00:06:48.292
singing in a very miserable way.

00:06:55.727 --> 00:07:00.817
So within us all these problems lie on the extremes of our being.

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:09.097
I’ll tell you how cancer is caused.

00:07:12.749 --> 00:07:16.500
Supposing the person is in the center

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.460
there is no possibility of

00:07:20.128 --> 00:07:22.180
his getting into cancer.

00:07:28.308 --> 00:07:32.999
Supposing he goes too much to the right; he is over active, planning,

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:35.199
futuristic man.

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:45.540
Then his chakras move outward like this.

00:07:49.827 --> 00:07:53.020
Then he becomes vulnerable to cancer.

00:07:56.735 --> 00:07:59.540
Because his connection to the mains is lost.

00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:07.140
But now, supposing somehow or other

00:08:07.419 --> 00:08:12.220
he goes to the left, he gets a shock or meets with an accident

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.900
or he meets a bad ‘guru’, he goes to the left,

00:08:22.854 --> 00:08:24.854
or he gets mesmerized.

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:29.860
Then he is triggered into cancer.

00:08:35.236 --> 00:08:37.236
Now the doctors do say

00:08:37.437 --> 00:08:41.535
that cancer is caused by triggering of…

00:08:43.054 --> 00:08:45.557
they call it protein 52,

00:08:45.758 --> 00:08:49.180
protein 54, protein 58.

00:08:56.974 --> 00:08:59.767
52, 54, 58.

00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:06.540
These are just the names given by them.

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:12.989
But they say that it is coming to us through the area

00:09:13.189 --> 00:09:16.500
which is built within us since our creation.

00:09:25.571 --> 00:09:29.460
That means there is an area which we call in Sahaja Yoga,

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.211
as collective subconscious,

00:09:38.478 --> 00:09:42.220
where everything that is dead in the atmosphere

00:09:42.778 --> 00:09:44.778
is stored.

00:09:47.926 --> 00:09:49.926
From our creation.

00:09:51.847 --> 00:09:54.660
And when anything from there

00:09:55.256 --> 00:09:57.500
comes into our attention,

00:09:57.779 --> 00:10:00.300
we start developing cancer;

00:10:07.864 --> 00:10:10.881
because you have lost connection with the whole.

00:10:14.124 --> 00:10:19.219
You become, the cells become on their own.

00:10:24.485 --> 00:10:26.485
They start acting on their own.

00:10:28.747 --> 00:10:31.380
That becomes, they become malignant.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:38.220
Now supposing you can bring by any chance,

00:10:38.421 --> 00:10:40.569
this centre, again these two,

00:10:40.769 --> 00:10:44.287
two broken chakras into one centre,

00:10:50.347 --> 00:10:52.347
then cancer can be cured.

00:10:55.051 --> 00:11:00.126
Sahaja Yoga has cured many types of cancer inclusive of blood cancer.

00:11:05.545 --> 00:11:08.100
But it is your own power.

00:11:10.578 --> 00:11:15.640
It is nobody else’s power, it is your own power within you works it out.

00:11:20.602 --> 00:11:25.660
And it has been now proved even by doctors,

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:30.020
as I told you yesterday that two doctors got their Phd,

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.248
in Sahaja Yoga, from Delhi University.

00:11:40.759 --> 00:11:44.619
There is another thing we can discuss here about

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:49.459
the diseases which are caused due to over activity of the mind.

00:11:55.977 --> 00:11:59.454
Here you can see in the centre is a round portion

00:11:59.655 --> 00:12:02.072
which we call as the ‘Void’.

00:12:06.599 --> 00:12:10.377
There resides the ten valences of human beings.

00:12:14.537 --> 00:12:18.140
And if these ten valances are enlightened

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.426
you can never go into extremes.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.705
But when you are overactive and extremely

00:12:31.906 --> 00:12:34.500
futuristic then,

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:38.539
there is a center there which is
called as ‘Swadishthana’, the second centre,

00:12:38.739 --> 00:12:41.300
has to work very hard;

00:12:50.261 --> 00:12:54.540
which actually looks after the aortic plexus in our stomach,

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.505
in our viscera, in the stomach.

00:13:04.134 --> 00:13:08.260
Now this chakra has one very important work to do

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:12.500
is to convert the fat of the stomach

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:16.940
for the use of the brain which is the grey cells.

00:13:29.954 --> 00:13:33.420
But if you think too much and too much and too much,

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.459
you need this replacement all the time.

00:13:40.979 --> 00:13:45.740
And this replacement is done by this chakra.

00:13:50.081 --> 00:13:53.339
Now this chakra has also other things to be done,

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.540
like liver,

00:13:58.862 --> 00:14:01.744
it has to look after the spleen,

00:14:03.175 --> 00:14:05.175
the pancreas,

00:14:05.825 --> 00:14:07.859
and intestines.

00:14:08.957 --> 00:14:12.461
Also it has to look after the kidneys

00:14:12.662 --> 00:14:15.640
and the lower end of the large intestines.

00:14:20.806 --> 00:14:25.420
So when this gets busy with transforming

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:30.329
the cells for the grey cells, fat cells into grey cells,

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:33.595
it has no time for other functions.

00:14:43.456 --> 00:14:46.688
As a result of that you get a very bad liver.

00:14:51.105 --> 00:14:56.820
Your attention becomes very distorted.

00:15:01.599 --> 00:15:04.872
And all the time you feel uneasy.

00:15:10.207 --> 00:15:13.420
You don’t feel like eating your food, and even if you eat,

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.620
you feel like vomiting it.

00:15:20.302 --> 00:15:23.492
But it can go further and you might get the cirrhosis of the liver,

00:15:23.692 --> 00:15:26.259
skin troubles all kinds of things.

00:15:34.033 --> 00:15:37.060
Specially, with a bad liver if you go for sun bathing,

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.460
you are sure to get skin cancer.

00:15:47.976 --> 00:15:50.780
Too much oil and too much fatty foods

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:53.380
if you eat also you get very bad liver.

00:15:59.096 --> 00:16:03.460
And maybe that you become very thin with it,

00:16:07.025 --> 00:16:12.020
because the liver cannot consume any fats in your body.

00:16:16.156 --> 00:16:20.140
Then there is also the pancreas,

00:16:20.546 --> 00:16:24.381
which is responsible for absorbing our sugar.

00:16:32.072 --> 00:16:34.530
That also goes out of order.

00:16:37.349 --> 00:16:40.813
As a result of that you develop diabetes.

00:16:43.672 --> 00:16:47.740
In an Indian village, a villager takes so much sugar

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:52.278
that he says that the spoon must stand in the cup.

00:16:59.382 --> 00:17:02.045
But he never gets diabetes.

00:17:04.247 --> 00:17:07.660
Because he does not sit down and think too much.

00:17:10.613 --> 00:17:13.737
He deals with the life as it comes to him.

00:17:16.248 --> 00:17:20.991
And he is above too much of thinking.

00:17:24.151 --> 00:17:28.501
Then the third thing that happens to you is even more serious.

00:17:31.569 --> 00:17:36.260
The spleen that is responsible for attending to your emergencies

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:40.140
produces more red blood corpuscles.

00:17:47.117 --> 00:17:49.700
Supposing you have taken some food

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.450
and after that you start running immediately,

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:55.294
you get a pain in that area.

00:18:02.329 --> 00:18:07.140
And that area becomes extremely sensitive.

00:18:10.213 --> 00:18:14.660
But in modern times, we are all the time giving shocks to our spleen,

00:18:19.139 --> 00:18:21.539
because our life is so hectic.

00:18:23.973 --> 00:18:27.980
Early in the morning we read the newspapers, horrible news, one shock.

00:18:33.013 --> 00:18:35.429
Then we are in a hurry, we have our lunch,

00:18:35.629 --> 00:18:38.700
somehow our breakfast somehow,

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.460
get into the car, and then we see the big crowd

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.700
of cars and a jam.

00:18:52.391 --> 00:18:54.391
Comes the second shock.

00:18:56.294 --> 00:19:00.647
And like that, we go on shocking our system all the time.

00:19:04.601 --> 00:19:07.660
Whatever arrogance human beings may have,

00:19:11.124 --> 00:19:14.060
whatever may they think of themselves,

00:19:16.124 --> 00:19:19.848
they must know that they are made very delicately

00:19:22.564 --> 00:19:24.564
and very carefully.

00:19:26.205 --> 00:19:29.205
They should not treat them like hippopotamus.

00:19:31.263 --> 00:19:33.263
They are human beings.

00:19:33.956 --> 00:19:37.036
And if they start treating themselves like that,

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:42.024
they end up with horrible diseases like blood cancer.

00:19:47.722 --> 00:19:51.245
Then with the kidney you develop high blood pressures,

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:58.100
then kidney non-functioning,

00:20:01.292 --> 00:20:03.292
then remove the kidney.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.870
You get constipated.

00:20:08.586 --> 00:20:13.489
All these things come to you because of over activity of the mind.

00:20:17.537 --> 00:20:21.137
Actually there is no need to plan too much.

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:28.260
Because if you go on planning like this, it never works out.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:35.972
You must keep it open to see how it works out.

00:20:40.734 --> 00:20:44.740
I had… I was staying somewhere else, at one place,

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:48.100
and I had to go to some place very far away.

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:51.700
Now if I had gone all the way back,

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:55.432
as planned, I would have never reached you.

00:21:06.353 --> 00:21:08.986
So I decided to come directly

00:21:11.733 --> 00:21:13.733
and it has worked,

00:21:15.349 --> 00:21:17.929
without disturbing my system.

00:21:19.731 --> 00:21:23.597
Now we have watches in our hands, and all the time looking at the watch

00:21:23.797 --> 00:21:26.546
and getting frightened of the time.

00:21:31.261 --> 00:21:33.261
We have to save time.

00:21:34.839 --> 00:21:36.839
But for what?

00:21:37.146 --> 00:21:41.380
Like somebody in India was very anxious to catch a plane

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:44.640
and he wouldn’t get a ticket so he was very agitated.

00:21:51.259 --> 00:21:53.259
I said, “But what is so necessary?”

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:56.377
He said, “I have to go and attend a ball”.

00:22:01.609 --> 00:22:03.609
Waste of time.

00:22:04.903 --> 00:22:09.860
For that he was so much jarring his own system.

00:22:14.703 --> 00:22:17.060
And when you hear such people,

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.352
suddenly they collapse and die with heart.

00:22:25.172 --> 00:22:27.991
Because if you become too much right sided,

00:22:28.192 --> 00:22:31.360
the Spirit stops,

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:36.485
He dies, in a sense that it never dies but it sleeps off. It disappears.

00:22:42.404 --> 00:22:45.070
Your heart becomes like a stone.

00:22:47.351 --> 00:22:49.999
With your arrogance it is even worse.

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:55.987
And then the reflection of God is not there.

00:22:59.128 --> 00:23:02.655
Such people have no compassion, no love

00:23:02.953 --> 00:23:04.960
and no joy.

00:23:07.904 --> 00:23:10.154
They are joy killers.

00:23:12.392 --> 00:23:15.797
All this running about is for joy.

00:23:19.683 --> 00:23:22.298
But it’s a joyless pursuit.

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:27.401
Then comes the left sided people,

00:23:30.142 --> 00:23:33.648
who indulges into nonsensical romances

00:23:36.717 --> 00:23:41.940
and indulge into all kinds of sufferings for nothing at all.

00:23:45.515 --> 00:23:49.820
Like in Paris, when I first went,
they said, “Mother, you look such a happy person.

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.173
They are not going to like You.”

00:23:59.516 --> 00:24:03.008
They think that joyous people are ignorant.

00:24:05.827 --> 00:24:08.565
They don’t know what is happening in this world.

00:24:10.435 --> 00:24:14.260
So I started My lecture with “Les Miserable”.

00:24:18.515 --> 00:24:20.602
“Les Miserable”.

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.380
If you have a pub

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:27.220
at every fifth lamp post,

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:32.050
and a bad women standing at every third lamp post in Paris,

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.524
you are inviting trouble.

00:24:44.434 --> 00:24:48.860
You see a person coming out of a pub and falling off on the street,

00:24:49.229 --> 00:24:52.029
and you enter into the same pub.

00:24:58.718 --> 00:25:02.140
You see people getting into the trouble with

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:04.660
funny sex habits,

00:25:06.758 --> 00:25:09.940
but still you want to do that, yourself.

00:25:17.997 --> 00:25:20.639
You are not a free person at all

00:25:22.235 --> 00:25:24.420
and neither you are powerful.

00:25:26.152 --> 00:25:30.700
You get tempted all the time to the forces of your destruction.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:37.500
So that you have no discretion either,

00:25:40.239 --> 00:25:42.900
nor understanding of your glory,

00:25:44.847 --> 00:25:46.859
nor of your beauty,

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:51.583
that God had created you especially to enter into His kingdom.

00:25:56.897 --> 00:26:00.321
So we live in our own paradise of destruction,

00:26:03.704 --> 00:26:07.011
go on destroying ourselves gradually.

00:26:09.741 --> 00:26:12.018
Nothing gives us happiness.

00:26:13.606 --> 00:26:15.460
We run from

00:26:16.533 --> 00:26:20.897
place to place to find happiness and joy.

00:26:24.539 --> 00:26:28.620
Ultimately, I think, people have to put electrodes in their limbic area,

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:31.529
to feel joy like the monkeys do.

00:26:38.649 --> 00:26:42.740
We don’t respect ourselves and we don’t try to understand ourselves.

00:26:46.717 --> 00:26:48.717
Why are we created?

00:26:51.145 --> 00:26:53.306
What is the purpose of our life?

00:26:55.211 --> 00:26:57.660
What do we have to get out of life?

00:27:00.225 --> 00:27:04.660
Such a ocean of joy is lying ahead

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:11.410
and we do not want to go to it.

00:27:13.696 --> 00:27:16.732
This kind of things are happening

00:27:17.106 --> 00:27:22.020
and that is why yesterday I told that Spanish people should now rise

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:26.432
and see and get the joy out of their lives.

00:27:33.956 --> 00:27:38.052
A little journey of three to four feet of the Kundalini

00:27:38.252 --> 00:27:41.184
brings forth this joy to you.

00:27:50.035 --> 00:27:54.700
So I have to make a request to you.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.920
As there is less time today,

00:27:57.121 --> 00:28:01.380
I won’t be asking for questions today.

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:05.900
Yesterday we spent about one and a half an hour on useless questions.

00:28:15.445 --> 00:28:17.820
So better get your Realization.

00:28:20.301 --> 00:28:23.054
You don’t have to know all these things.

00:28:25.509 --> 00:28:27.925
As you don’t have to know about the electricity,

00:28:28.125 --> 00:28:31.740
you have to just put on the switch because it is all built in.

00:28:36.839 --> 00:28:38.839
May God bless you all!

00:28:40.709 --> 00:28:44.955
I come here every year and I am sure I will come next year also.

00:29:03.027 --> 00:29:07.816
It is little bit cooperation you have to give Me.

00:29:12.237 --> 00:29:15.860
As you have seen I have taken out the shoes

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:19.003
because the Mother Earth helps us a lot.

00:29:24.605 --> 00:29:29.304
She sucks our problems much faster than we know of.

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:39.507
So, we should try to take out our shoes and put both the feet like this,

00:29:39.707 --> 00:29:43.555
parallel, because left and right are two different energies.

00:29:51.544 --> 00:29:57.020
Even the other day a lady had so much objection in taking out her shoes.

00:30:02.579 --> 00:30:04.820
I just don’t understand.

00:30:07.015 --> 00:30:09.460
There are so many wrong things we are doing,

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:12.284
people have no objection to that.

00:30:18.368 --> 00:30:21.372
So don’t pay attention to frivolous things.

00:30:24.958 --> 00:30:30.190
Now, please put your left hand towards Me like this,

00:30:30.391 --> 00:30:32.940
which suggests symbolically

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:36.540
that you desire to have your Realization.

00:30:44.414 --> 00:30:49.180
And those who do not want to have Realization should leave this hall,

00:30:53.618 --> 00:30:55.665
and leave others in peace,

00:30:57.334 --> 00:31:00.366
because they act negatively for others.

00:31:03.978 --> 00:31:06.876
Now please put your left hand towards Me like this,

00:31:10.654 --> 00:31:14.273
and put the right hand on your heart.

00:31:16.144 --> 00:31:19.100
As I said, in the heart resides the Spirit.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:25.340
Then you have to put your right hand

00:31:25.685 --> 00:31:28.443
on the upper part your abdomen

00:31:28.644 --> 00:31:30.644
on the left hand side.

00:31:35.577 --> 00:31:39.747
This is the centre of your mastery.

00:31:43.507 --> 00:31:48.214
Then you have to put your right hand in the lower part of your abdomen.

00:31:55.515 --> 00:31:58.900
This is the centre of

00:31:59.812 --> 00:32:04.776
the pure knowledge, manifesting through your central nervous system,

00:32:10.229 --> 00:32:12.780
the knowledge of divine laws.

00:32:15.123 --> 00:32:18.940
Then again we go back in the upper part of the abdomen,

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:21.151
on the left hand side.

00:32:24.452 --> 00:32:26.780
Then we go again to the heart.

00:32:28.737 --> 00:32:31.660
Then we go, take our hand in

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:35.980
the corner of your neck and turn your head to the right.

00:32:41.093 --> 00:32:44.460
This is the center which catches when you feel guilty

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:47.940
and unnecessarily angry with yourself.

00:32:55.342 --> 00:32:58.757
You have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself.

00:33:00.788 --> 00:33:04.460
Then we take our hand on

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:10.820
top of our, I mean on our forehead across, like this,

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:13.491
and press it on both the sides.

00:33:18.404 --> 00:33:22.597
Now we take this hand on the backside of our head,

00:33:22.797 --> 00:33:25.838
and put our head on this to rest and

00:33:26.038 --> 00:33:29.147
put it upward like that our head.

00:33:34.324 --> 00:33:39.540
Now we stretch our hand like this,

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:42.198
and put the center of our hand,

00:33:42.398 --> 00:33:46.020
on top of the fontanel bone area.

00:33:48.255 --> 00:33:50.247
Right hand, right hand.

00:33:53.951 --> 00:33:56.622
And now move it,

00:33:56.823 --> 00:33:58.823
your scalp.

00:34:05.013 --> 00:34:08.788
Seven times. Keep your fingers up like that.

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:15.460
Now, please close your eyes.

00:34:17.133 --> 00:34:21.825
I have already requested people who
don’t want to do Sahaja Yoga, should go away.

00:34:22.026 --> 00:34:26.637
Please. There's not need to be so aggressive.

00:34:32.556 --> 00:34:34.556
Please.

00:34:36.944 --> 00:34:39.461
Still they don’t want to go; it’s very wrong

00:34:39.661 --> 00:34:41.661
and very aggressive.

00:34:44.531 --> 00:34:47.939
You cannot look at other people when you are not doing it.

00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:13.090
Thank you very much.

00:35:27.245 --> 00:35:29.829
Now, please close your eyes.

00:35:32.979 --> 00:35:37.660
Don’t open your eyes. Put both the feet parallel on the Mother Earth.

00:35:42.856 --> 00:35:45.998
Until I tell you don’t open your eyes.

00:35:49.081 --> 00:35:52.235
Now please put your left hand towards Me and right hand

00:35:52.436 --> 00:35:54.498
on your heart.

00:35:58.424 --> 00:36:03.100
Now here ask Me a very fundamental question.

00:36:07.419 --> 00:36:11.500
You may call Me Shri Mataji or you can call Me Mother.

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.562
“Mother am I the Spirit?”

00:36:14.762 --> 00:36:17.300
Ask this question three times.

00:36:33.406 --> 00:36:38.300
Now, if you are the Spirit,

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.417
you are your master.

00:36:40.618 --> 00:36:45.140
So put your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen,

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:48.540
the left hand side and ask another fundamental question,

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:52.420
“Mother am I my own master?” Ask three times.

00:37:08.904 --> 00:37:11.100
Now you are free people.

00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:14.340
I cannot force on you anything,

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:17.700
leave alone the pure knowledge of the Divine.

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:20.420
So you have to ask for it.

00:37:30.737 --> 00:37:36.019
So please bring your right hand
in the lower part of your abdomen,

00:37:36.322 --> 00:37:38.341
in the left hand side.

00:37:42.332 --> 00:37:44.336
And now please say,

00:37:44.536 --> 00:37:49.389
“Mother, please give me pure knowledge of the Divine”.

00:37:55.624 --> 00:37:57.738
Please say it six times.

00:37:59.351 --> 00:38:01.860
There are six petals to this center.

00:38:22.617 --> 00:38:27.691
Now as soon as you say these things,

00:38:27.891 --> 00:38:30.580
your Kundalini starts moving.

00:38:36.647 --> 00:38:39.340
To facilitate Her movement,

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:43.043
please raise your hand to the upper center,

00:38:43.243 --> 00:38:48.605
which is in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side.

00:38:54.715 --> 00:38:58.180
Now, here, you have to say

00:38:58.991 --> 00:39:01.148
with full confidence

00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:04.820
to facilitate the movement of the Kundalini,

00:39:05.747 --> 00:39:10.432
“Mother I am my own master”. Say it ten times.

00:39:35.021 --> 00:39:38.500
Now you have to know the greatest truth about you

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:42.935
is that you are the Spirit.

00:39:49.247 --> 00:39:53.356
You are not this body, you are not this conditioning,

00:39:53.556 --> 00:39:57.100
not this ego, not this mind.

00:40:03.667 --> 00:40:05.820
But you are the Spirit.

00:40:06.845 --> 00:40:10.660
So now please put your hand on your heart.

00:40:13.747 --> 00:40:16.260
And with full confidence say,

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:20.340
twelve times, “Mother I am the Spirit”.

00:40:28.677 --> 00:40:30.831
Have full confidence.

00:41:03.155 --> 00:41:08.380
Now the Divine is the ocean of love

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:10.240
and compassion.

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:15.060
But above all It is the ocean of forgiveness.

00:41:23.637 --> 00:41:27.841
Above all it is the forgiveness,

00:41:28.041 --> 00:41:33.290
then you cannot make any mistakes which can’t be engulfed

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:37.820
by this great power of forgiveness of God.

00:41:43.832 --> 00:41:46.860
So please first forgive yourself.

00:41:50.958 --> 00:41:52.961
You have to love yourself

00:41:53.161 --> 00:41:56.540
and you have to be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

00:42:01.393 --> 00:42:06.340
Now put your hand on your shoulder

00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:11.580
between the neck and your shoulder,

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:16.740
in the corner, and put your head to your right.

00:42:24.123 --> 00:42:26.660
Here now you have to say,

00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:28.940
with full confidence

00:42:29.897 --> 00:42:31.940
for sixteen times,

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:37.100
“Mother I am not guilty at all”.

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:49.500
Sixteen times.

00:42:51.431 --> 00:42:55.020
Now those who still want to feel guilty can punish themselves

00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:57.657
by saying it 108 times.

00:43:34.606 --> 00:43:38.684
Now please take your hand

00:43:38.884 --> 00:43:41.540
on top of your forehead across

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:44.220
and bend your head a little.

00:43:50.864 --> 00:43:53.300
Here you have to say

00:43:54.495 --> 00:43:56.740
from your heart,

00:43:57.014 --> 00:43:59.860
“Mother I forgive everyone”.

00:44:05.712 --> 00:44:10.140
If you say it is difficult to forgive then know that it is a myth,

00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:13.140
whether you forgive or if you don’t forgive.

00:44:18.963 --> 00:44:21.380
But if you do not forgive,

00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:24.260
then you play into wrong hands.

00:44:28.296 --> 00:44:31.271
Yesterday I saw many people didn’t get Realization,

00:44:31.471 --> 00:44:33.660
and when they came to Me and they said,

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:38.020
“Mother I forgive everyone”, they got it. So please do it now.

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.500
Forgive everything,

00:44:54.676 --> 00:44:56.676
everyone.

00:44:58.994 --> 00:45:02.740
Now, take your hand on the back side of your head

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:06.968
and put back your head, resting on that hand.

00:45:13.396 --> 00:45:18.302
Here you have to say without feeling guilty,

00:45:18.806 --> 00:45:20.900
“Mother”,

00:45:22.285 --> 00:45:24.820
or “the Divine

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:28.678
if I have done any mistakes please forgive me”,

00:45:28.879 --> 00:45:33.240
without counting your mistakes, without feeling guilty.

00:45:48.984 --> 00:45:53.100
Now, stretch your hand

00:45:53.707 --> 00:45:55.620
straight,

00:45:56.585 --> 00:46:00.153
and put your centre of your palm

00:46:00.354 --> 00:46:02.740
on top of your head.

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:07.180
Bend your head, stretch your fingers

00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:09.340
and press your scalp,

00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:13.487
move it seven times slowly.

00:46:24.355 --> 00:46:26.420
Bend your head please.

00:46:28.186 --> 00:46:31.325
Here also I cannot force you.

00:46:31.526 --> 00:46:33.847
So you have to say “Mother,

00:46:34.047 --> 00:46:37.919
please give me my Realization”, seven times.

00:47:26.938 --> 00:47:29.620
Now, take down your hand.

00:47:32.248 --> 00:47:34.260
Please open your eyes.

00:47:39.984 --> 00:47:42.780
Now put your right hand towards Me.

00:47:48.403 --> 00:47:50.260
Bend your head

00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:57.580
and see for yourself if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

00:48:08.416 --> 00:48:11.979
Now take your left hand like this.

00:48:17.669 --> 00:48:21.460
Put your right hand on top of your head

00:48:25.094 --> 00:48:28.900
and see for yourself if you are feeling the cool breeze.

00:48:32.795 --> 00:48:34.860
Bend your head a little.

00:49:00.317 --> 00:49:03.677
Now, again put your right hand towards Me

00:49:06.739 --> 00:49:10.739
and see with your left hand if you can feel the cool breeze.

00:49:16.076 --> 00:49:18.460
Now raise your both the hands,

00:49:20.937 --> 00:49:23.747
high up. Raise your head.

00:49:25.179 --> 00:49:28.500
Bend it back and ask the question,

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:32.420
“Mother is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

00:49:37.076 --> 00:49:41.140
“Mother is this the Brahma Shakti?”

00:49:43.947 --> 00:49:48.099
“Mother is this the love of God?”

00:49:52.898 --> 00:49:55.098
Ask these questions three times.

00:50:04.984 --> 00:50:08.157
Now, bring down your hands please.

00:50:09.468 --> 00:50:11.620
Watch Me without thinking.

00:50:39.165 --> 00:50:42.700
Now those who have felt the cool breeze

00:50:43.733 --> 00:50:46.236
in the hands or in their heads,

00:50:46.436 --> 00:50:48.860
please raise both your hands.

00:51:02.029 --> 00:51:06.100
Most of those who came two days have got it.

00:51:10.277 --> 00:51:12.594
Those who have come only today,

00:51:12.794 --> 00:51:14.794
may not have got it.

00:51:18.876 --> 00:51:21.693
So many of you have got your Realization.

00:51:24.516 --> 00:51:28.460
Now it is now like a sprouting of the seed.

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:34.940
And you have to grow.

00:51:36.814 --> 00:51:39.388
We have got a centre here,

00:51:39.658 --> 00:51:43.953
where you should meet and grow.

00:51:44.153 --> 00:51:47.620
Within one month’s time you will be a master.

00:51:58.090 --> 00:52:02.380
You know we don’t take money, so we have very humble place.

00:52:07.018 --> 00:52:10.259
And you have to be very humble yourself.

00:52:14.136 --> 00:52:16.940
And please see that you all grow.

00:52:21.028 --> 00:52:23.900
Some of you did not get Realization

00:52:26.711 --> 00:52:29.580
or maybe you did not feel the cool breeze,

00:52:31.724 --> 00:52:34.340
but might be feeling peaceful within.

00:52:36.793 --> 00:52:41.900
If this centre is out of gear also you don’t feel the vibrations.

00:52:47.851 --> 00:52:52.260
If you have not forgiven people, also you don’t feel the vibrations.

00:52:57.332 --> 00:53:00.820
So you have to take it up seriously.

00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:07.260
You are entering into a new world,

00:53:09.269 --> 00:53:12.980
and not to be treated frivolously, childishly.

00:53:16.584 --> 00:53:20.801
And I am sure all of you will develop that subtlety

00:53:24.898 --> 00:53:27.380
and all the powers

00:53:28.754 --> 00:53:32.354
by which you can to do miraculous things.

00:53:35.398 --> 00:53:39.163
I am sorry today there is short of time, so I have to go.

00:53:39.363 --> 00:53:42.340
But I hope you all will look after yourself.

00:53:47.991 --> 00:53:50.180
You have a very good,

00:53:50.538 --> 00:53:53.639
wise Sahaja Yogi here,

00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:57.700
who is the leader of Spanish people.

00:54:02.431 --> 00:54:05.180
You don’t have to spend any money.

00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:10.191
Only you have to pay attention to yourself

00:54:10.392 --> 00:54:14.992
and you have to attend the center.

00:54:22.293 --> 00:54:26.194
You cannot do it individually. It is a collective happening.

00:54:31.124 --> 00:54:35.260
Like one tree is supplying sap to all the leaves.

00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:43.461
The leaf that develops a bark between

00:54:43.661 --> 00:54:46.020
itself and the tree, falls off.

00:54:52.458 --> 00:54:54.844
With little patience with yourself,

00:54:55.044 --> 00:54:58.928
you will develop that subtle

00:55:00.387 --> 00:55:04.220
being within yourself, by which you will

00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:08.620
feel the joy of the Divine,

00:55:18.763 --> 00:55:20.860
which is your right,

00:55:21.909 --> 00:55:24.580
which you all should have.

00:55:25.330 --> 00:55:27.330
May God bless you all.

00:55:33.012 --> 00:55:37.540
Only thing I have to request, that don’t talk to anyone now.

00:55:41.406 --> 00:55:44.580
Please go home in this silence

00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:47.420
and don’t discuss and argue.

00:55:52.706 --> 00:55:55.380
Because you lose your vibrations.

00:55:58.143 --> 00:56:03.300
So I have to request you not to argue it out. You cannot argue it.

00:56:06.206 --> 00:56:08.380
It has to work out.

00:56:10.242 --> 00:56:13.916
Those who have not got also should not blame anyone.

00:56:19.537 --> 00:56:21.537
May God bless you.

00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:30.304
Finished at ten o’clock as you said it.

00:56:37.595 --> 00:56:39.595
Where are My shoes?
