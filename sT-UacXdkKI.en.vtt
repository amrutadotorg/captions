"The Spirit Integrates You" 4th Public Programme

00:00:55.166 --> 00:01:05.500
September 30th, 1982, Urania, Vienna, Austria

00:03:30.417 --> 00:03:35.667
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:03:40.667 --> 00:03:42.583
In my last lectures

00:03:43.208 --> 00:03:47.125
I’ve been telling you about these centers

00:03:47.792 --> 00:03:54.917
which are placed in the lower part of the body.

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.250
Today I would like to cover the rest of the three centers

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.291
which lie here, here and here.

00:04:14.792 --> 00:04:20.875
These are very important centers for human beings.

00:04:22.125 --> 00:04:28.250
When man as a human being raised his head up,

00:04:28.792 --> 00:04:33.792
this center established a new dimension.

00:04:39.458 --> 00:04:43.750
This center is called as Vishuddhi chakra.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.333
And this has got sixteen petals

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:53.834
which manifests in the sympathetic or

00:04:54.166 --> 00:04:55.709
the para-sympathetic nervous system

00:04:56.125 --> 00:04:59.625
sixteen plexuses,

00:05:03.667 --> 00:05:08.917
which looks after our eyes, nose, throat,

00:05:12.792 --> 00:05:15.583
and our tongue,

00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:18.834
our eyes, part of the eyes,

00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:25.125
and the whole expression of the face.

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:31.125
When man is ego-oriented, he puts back his head like that.

00:05:34.875 --> 00:05:36.959
And when he’s super-ego-oriented,

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.417
he puts down his head like that.

00:05:43.792 --> 00:05:47.917
This center is extremely important for human beings

00:05:48.291 --> 00:05:50.917
and for Sahaja Yoga,

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.917
because the hands play a big part in Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:01.208 --> 00:06:04.375
To get a universal language we have to use our hands -

00:06:04.375 --> 00:06:07.959
that is the best, for say, for people who are blind,

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.083
who are deaf and dumb, best thing for them is

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.667
to use the hands.

00:06:21.458 --> 00:06:25.083
So these hands, though we express ourselves by moving

00:06:25.542 --> 00:06:31.917
fingers and gestures, are still not enlightened.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.291
When this center gets enlightened

00:06:41.125 --> 00:06:46.625
then these hands become enlightened, too.

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:51.500
This center has two sides,

00:06:51.875 --> 00:06:55.625
one on the right and one on the left.

00:06:58.333 --> 00:07:05.542
The left-side center is caught up when a person feels guilty

00:07:08.917 --> 00:07:13.250
and obstructs the ascent of the Kundalini.

00:07:15.125 --> 00:07:18.500
That’s why I always request all the Western seekers first

00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:26.709
to say in their hearts, “Mother, I’m not guilty.”

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:36.333
These are the conditionings that have come to us

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.208
from so-called religions,

00:07:40.792 --> 00:07:43.542
from so-called psychologists,

00:07:44.208 --> 00:07:47.250
and other people who are responsible for our development

00:07:47.583 --> 00:07:50.208
in our childhood.

00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:57.959
When material things were very important for the parents,

00:08:02.625 --> 00:08:05.875
they all the time shout at children or correct them, saying

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.375
that, “Don’t spoil the carpet, don’t spoil that,

00:08:08.875 --> 00:08:12.875
don’t spoil that.”

00:08:16.917 --> 00:08:23.458
And that is how we develop a kind of a guilt within us.

00:08:25.208 --> 00:08:28.125
When we grow up in the schools and colleges,

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:33.583
this can be built up very heavily within us, too.

00:08:39.125 --> 00:08:42.041
Education has to be imparted to children with great love

00:08:42.542 --> 00:08:46.166
and understanding.

00:08:48.208 --> 00:08:52.999
There’s a big feeling, especially with the people who are

00:08:53.333 --> 00:08:59.333
very developed that children must be controlled

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.834
by brainwashing.

00:09:06.917 --> 00:09:10.583
But this brainwashing results in this funny trouble called

00:09:11.458 --> 00:09:12.166
guilt.

00:09:18.959 --> 00:09:22.750
In the same way the psychologists who discuss

00:09:22.999 --> 00:09:29.625
this subject of guilt are really not understanding the effects

00:09:29.999 --> 00:09:33.917
of this kind of a discussion.

00:09:39.458 --> 00:09:45.208
These psychologists, when they talk about the trouble of guilt,

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:49.625
they do not know that these are pathological cases.

00:09:50.041 --> 00:09:53.000
This is not normal, this is abnormal case.

00:09:53.458 --> 00:09:55.959
But if you start discussing about these abnormal cases

00:09:56.375 --> 00:10:01.375
in a general way, it becomes a general disease.

00:10:13.083 --> 00:10:15.999
They themselves work with the sick people,

00:10:16.417 --> 00:10:19.291
who are possessed, and they have no way of protecting

00:10:19.667 --> 00:10:21.917
themselves from these sick people.

00:10:22.333 --> 00:10:27.917
That is how they themselves become sick.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:37.166
And then once they develop this sickness within them,

00:10:37.583 --> 00:10:42.500
they start generating it on a larger areas by saying that

00:10:42.959 --> 00:10:45.542
one develops a guilt, and this happens with guilt,

00:10:45.875 --> 00:10:49.083
that happens with guilt.

00:10:55.208 --> 00:11:00.208
Now God has created human beings in His own image.

00:11:04.208 --> 00:11:07.583
There is no need for human beings to feel guilty

00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:10.959
for nothing at all.

00:11:12.875 --> 00:11:15.834
If these human judges have not been able to find you

00:11:16.166 --> 00:11:20.375
as guilty, how can that judge, who is nothing but compassion,

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:25.375
will brand you as guilty?

00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:36.417
You have come from amoeba to this stage,

00:11:39.417 --> 00:11:43.208
and God has created you as the epitome

00:11:43.917 --> 00:11:47.834
of the whole Creation.

00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:53.625
And now at this stage you start feeling guilty.

00:11:55.166 --> 00:12:00.875
When He wants you to adorn the seat of your Spirit

00:12:01.375 --> 00:12:05.417
at this great moment, you are becoming guilty -

00:12:06.125 --> 00:12:08.583
just very disappointing,

00:12:08.583 --> 00:12:12.917
the whole thing is extremely disappointing.

00:12:21.667 --> 00:12:26.250
All these evolutionary things have happened within you,

00:12:26.834 --> 00:12:32.250
not to make you feel guilty.

00:12:34.875 --> 00:12:38.625
It would be like a prince who is now to be anointed

00:12:39.166 --> 00:12:41.667
as a king, suddenly stops - says that

00:12:41.959 --> 00:12:47.625
“Oh, I’m guilty, I can’t become the king.”

00:12:51.583 --> 00:12:56.250
Self-pity is worse than suicide.

00:13:01.083 --> 00:13:08.458
So the right-side problem is just the opposite of left side.

00:13:13.875 --> 00:13:20.166
That is a person who talks with aggressiveness,

00:13:21.959 --> 00:13:25.625
who has a personality that he talks in such a way that

00:13:25.999 --> 00:13:31.208
he impresses people and puts them down.

00:13:32.125 --> 00:13:38.709
Such a person develops a very harsh and a dry personality.

00:13:40.917 --> 00:13:44.000
I know of a dentist who came to see Me. He was a dentist,

00:13:44.375 --> 00:13:47.500
but he told Me, “Mother, I have lost power to smile even.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.041
I can’t smile now.

00:13:49.709 --> 00:13:56.375
My muscles do not go into the mood of smiling at all.

00:14:03.041 --> 00:14:07.875
I have become so feelingless that I cannot smile - nor cry.”

00:14:12.999 --> 00:14:16.792
So he went to some saint, so-called, and the saint said,

00:14:17.125 --> 00:14:21.500
“Oh you have gone beyond everything now.”

00:14:25.458 --> 00:14:29.583
This is the wrong idea we have for people who are very

00:14:29.875 --> 00:14:33.999
great in spirituality.

00:14:38.083 --> 00:14:43.291
Such a person has to be an ocean of compassion,

00:14:45.291 --> 00:14:51.458
ocean of love and ocean of forgiveness.

00:14:53.125 --> 00:14:54.583
Above all,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.792
he should be able to give joy to people and not miseries.

00:15:01.625 --> 00:15:05.333
Normally wherever I see a painting of a saint or

00:15:05.834 --> 00:15:12.999
a statue of a saint, he looks the most miserable to Me.

00:15:16.542 --> 00:15:22.083
Wherever the some artists, architects have carved the popes

00:15:22.625 --> 00:15:25.750
and the bishops and all that, they look so miserable

00:15:26.166 --> 00:15:30.709
that nobody would like to take their place.

00:15:40.333 --> 00:15:43.000
Sometimes with these aggressive people,

00:15:43.375 --> 00:15:44.834
as a result of their aggression,

00:15:44.834 --> 00:15:47.166
also develop the left side because they feel guilty

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.875
the way they have talked to others.

00:15:57.709 --> 00:16:00.041
With this you develop problems

00:16:00.458 --> 00:16:06.000
both the sides of the center if they are in imbalance,

00:16:06.291 --> 00:16:09.709
you develop a center into such a way that

00:16:10.041 --> 00:16:14.166
a physical problem called spondylitis can develop.

00:16:20.917 --> 00:16:24.875
If you feel guilty or if you feel aggressive,

00:16:25.208 --> 00:16:28.250
both ways it can work out.

00:16:32.709 --> 00:16:36.458
Specially if you feel guilty, then also a heart problem

00:16:36.834 --> 00:16:41.041
called angina - sort of a thing develops.

00:16:45.125 --> 00:16:50.417
And also you develop a stiff left hand with that.

00:16:54.041 --> 00:16:57.792
Now in short I have told you about the Vishuddhi chakra,

00:16:58.166 --> 00:16:59.750
because we have to cover three chakras,

00:17:00.166 --> 00:17:05.083
and I want to tell you today about the Spirit.

00:17:11.083 --> 00:17:15.500
Above that is the center of Agnya.

00:17:20.041 --> 00:17:25.999
Agnya chakra lies in the region of

00:17:26.625 --> 00:17:30.750
pituitary and pineal body.

00:17:38.792 --> 00:17:44.291
It is placed exactly in the center of optic chiasma.

00:17:47.709 --> 00:17:51.000
One of the windows of Agnya chakra is shown here

00:17:51.834 --> 00:17:56.583
on My forehead with this mark,

00:18:00.625 --> 00:18:04.959
and another one is at the back of the head.

00:18:06.166 --> 00:18:09.834
Now this center is also extremely important because

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:14.417
it controls your ego and super-ego.

00:18:18.667 --> 00:18:25.208
This is the center where Jesus Christ, our Lord resides.

00:18:29.375 --> 00:18:34.500
Many priests have been shocked when I told them this.

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:41.125
But His cross is symbolic of this cross where the ego and

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:47.417
super-ego cross each other and are extremely close.

00:18:52.375 --> 00:18:56.166
This is the place where Christ was to be placed and

00:18:56.625 --> 00:19:00.417
bestowed upon, and this was to be accomplished by

00:19:00.875 --> 00:19:04.125
His crucifixion so that His subtler body enters into

00:19:04.667 --> 00:19:08.834
that area of our awareness.

00:19:18.625 --> 00:19:20.625
When Christ said on the cross that,

00:19:20.625 --> 00:19:24.375
“Now it has been established”  He meant to say that

00:19:25.208 --> 00:19:30.875
this accomplishment is the establishment of Christ

00:19:31.417 --> 00:19:33.875
in that center, which is very,

00:19:34.417 --> 00:19:39.667
very subtle and difficult to enter into.

00:19:56.417 --> 00:20:01.625
He was, His body, only His body was made of

00:20:01.999 --> 00:20:06.291
the vibrations that you feel.

00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:13.333
These vibrations are called either Om or

00:20:14.125 --> 00:20:18.166
Chaitanya in Sanskrit language.

00:20:23.208 --> 00:20:29.999
When He is just made of that, He could walk on the water.

00:20:32.999 --> 00:20:36.375
The other day somebody told Me that Christ has been

00:20:37.125 --> 00:20:44.375
born somewhere and now He is going to come on the TV.

00:20:47.125 --> 00:20:49.500
So I said, “Better ask Him to walk on the water and then

00:20:49.875 --> 00:20:52.999
you’ll find Him.”

00:20:57.875 --> 00:21:00.208
Now, this establishment was important,

00:21:00.625 --> 00:21:05.333
and at the time of crucifixion, when He was in that state,

00:21:05.792 --> 00:21:08.917
He said only one sentence, which shows that something

00:21:09.208 --> 00:21:12.333
was to be accomplished by His crucifixion. “It”.

00:21:12.792 --> 00:21:14.667
“He didn’t say everything is accomplished -

00:21:14.917 --> 00:21:19.625
He said, “It has been accomplished.”

00:21:32.166 --> 00:21:36.667
He has talked of the future about Holy Ghost, that

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.250
everything will be forgiven whatever is done to Him,

00:21:39.709 --> 00:21:40.999
because done in ignorance,

00:21:41.458 --> 00:21:47.500
but nothing against the Holy Ghost will be forgiven.

00:21:57.709 --> 00:22:00.333
He said, “I’ll send you a counselor,

00:22:00.792 --> 00:22:03.375
who’ll explain everything to you.

00:22:03.792 --> 00:22:09.792
I will send you a redeemer, who’ll redeem you.

00:22:10.333 --> 00:22:16.291
And a comforter, who will give you comfort.”

00:22:25.166 --> 00:22:26.792
The third thing He has said that,

00:22:27.166 --> 00:22:30.625
“You are to be born again.”

00:22:32.917 --> 00:22:37.125
He’s the only one who said this in the whole of Bible,

00:22:37.458 --> 00:22:40.250
Moses and all these people, it is He who said that,

00:22:40.583 --> 00:22:44.667
“You are to be born again.”

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.166
Because Moses, as I told you the other day, and Abraham

00:22:51.583 --> 00:22:56.583
were busy establishing your balance in that green part

00:22:56.875 --> 00:22:59.500
of the body.

00:23:07.291 --> 00:23:09.917
But this awakening of Christ within you,

00:23:10.291 --> 00:23:15.417
the awakening of your power as a second birth

00:23:15.709 --> 00:23:19.542
was only said by Christ.

00:23:26.625 --> 00:23:31.250
So we started giving baptism to people.

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:35.709
You get some water from somewhere,

00:23:36.125 --> 00:23:38.041
appoint somebody as a clergyman,

00:23:38.417 --> 00:23:43.750
put on the head of a person and say, “You are baptized.”

00:23:48.333 --> 00:23:51.542
It is such an artificial thing

00:23:52.458 --> 00:23:54.750
because there is nothing that has happened,

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:59.999
just you have put some water, anybody can do it.

00:24:02.125 --> 00:24:04.792
But to get baptism, you have to raise the Kundalini

00:24:05.208 --> 00:24:08.750
to break through.

00:24:13.417 --> 00:24:15.709
Christ didn’t say that, “You take water and put on

00:24:16.041 --> 00:24:20.041
somebody’s head” , did He say so?

00:24:21.625 --> 00:24:25.625
But a second birth has to take place.

00:24:28.375 --> 00:24:29.500
And the second birth,

00:24:29.792 --> 00:24:32.208
birth itself means an evolutionary process,

00:24:32.542 --> 00:24:36.417
or you can call it a living process has to take place.

00:24:40.417 --> 00:24:45.667
In Sanskrit language a bird is called as Dvijaha,

00:24:47.458 --> 00:24:51.166
and a realized soul also as Dvijaha,

00:24:54.166 --> 00:24:57.250
means twice-born.

00:24:57.875 --> 00:25:00.750
Like a bird is an egg, first of all,

00:25:01.083 --> 00:25:03.083
then he grows in that eggshell,

00:25:03.542 --> 00:25:06.083
and then it matures, it breaks through,

00:25:06.458 --> 00:25:09.250
and it comes out as a transformed personality,

00:25:09.792 --> 00:25:15.500
as something else, absolutely something else from the egg.

00:25:25.999 --> 00:25:31.667
On the Easter day we give people eggs

00:25:33.583 --> 00:25:35.583
to remind them that, "You are egg now and

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.291
you have to become the bird.”

00:25:43.083 --> 00:25:46.208
But I don’t think people know that,

00:25:48.417 --> 00:25:52.291
because resurrection is the message of Christ.

00:25:54.667 --> 00:25:57.583
Crucifixion is the accomplishment,

00:25:58.083 --> 00:26:01.417
but Resurrection is His message.

00:26:11.959 --> 00:26:16.500
And the way we are making Christ look so miserable

00:26:16.792 --> 00:26:20.750
is something I just can’t understand.

00:26:26.166 --> 00:26:29.959
They just show the skeleton of Christ hanging

00:26:29.959 --> 00:26:31.834
with a skin there -

00:26:32.166 --> 00:26:36.000
can a skeleton carry such a big cross?

00:26:44.625 --> 00:26:47.959
Michelangelo was another realized soul who painted Christ

00:26:48.208 --> 00:26:53.208
like the way He was, a huge person,

00:26:59.417 --> 00:27:05.834
person who was healthy, full of vigor and joy,

00:27:07.959 --> 00:27:12.792
and not a miserable pitiable caricature.

00:27:16.166 --> 00:27:19.417
I think people who are sadistic enjoy this kind of a thing

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:21.875
to see somebody miserable.

00:27:22.166 --> 00:27:25.083
Perhaps that is the reason because just below that I have

00:27:25.417 --> 00:27:27.792
seen a miserable looking skeleton

00:27:28.166 --> 00:27:32.875
put there as Christ on the table.

00:27:48.166 --> 00:27:53.208
Spiritual life is not misery by any chance.

00:27:56.999 --> 00:28:04.625
It was a thing of great pride that Christ came on this earth

00:28:10.166 --> 00:28:13.375
because when He’s awakened within us at this point,

00:28:13.709 --> 00:28:17.625
He sucks in the ego and super-ego.

00:28:23.999 --> 00:28:26.208
That means He takes away all our conditionings and

00:28:26.625 --> 00:28:29.750
our actions, the karmas.

00:28:33.333 --> 00:28:36.000
That means in the Christian words we can say

00:28:36.333 --> 00:28:40.125
He sucks away all our sins.

00:28:41.208 --> 00:28:43.375
He has died for us.

00:28:44.709 --> 00:28:47.375
He has gone through all the miseries.

00:28:50.291 --> 00:28:54.999
He didn’t leave any misery for us to go through.

00:28:56.375 --> 00:29:01.999
There is no need for anyone to be miserable now.

00:29:02.834 --> 00:29:06.041
For example, Jews said that, “Oh we...-

00:29:06.667 --> 00:29:09.041
they denied Christ and that’s how they said,

00:29:09.041 --> 00:29:12.083
"Oh we must have miseries.

00:29:17.458 --> 00:29:20.417
We have to suffer."

00:29:21.083 --> 00:29:23.417
So they suffered nicely.

00:29:23.709 --> 00:29:25.667
When Hitler came in, he made them suffer.

00:29:25.917 --> 00:29:29.792
That’s what they were thinking was religious life, was that?

00:29:37.709 --> 00:29:40.041
And today the same people who suffered

00:29:40.458 --> 00:29:43.500
have become the other side of it and they are doing all

00:29:43.834 --> 00:29:49.834
kinds of things without any relation to their religion.

00:29:58.542 --> 00:30:01.667
Because the greatest of greatest Commandment is,

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.999
“Thou shalt not kill” .

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.458
And then how do you explain this Christian militia

00:30:13.792 --> 00:30:19.166
in the name of Christ killing so many helpless people?

00:30:23.041 --> 00:30:25.041
Small children,

00:30:25.875 --> 00:30:31.792
innocent small children, women, for no crime of theirs.

00:30:36.041 --> 00:30:38.291
In the name of God, in the name of Christ,

00:30:38.792 --> 00:30:43.250
in the name of Mohammed, these people are just using

00:30:43.542 --> 00:30:47.208
their sadism.

00:30:56.166 --> 00:30:58.625
Where is the word that is said as love

00:30:58.959 --> 00:31:03.875
and compassion of God?

00:31:05.834 --> 00:31:07.417
Mohammed has talked of Rahamat,

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:10.291
all the time of Rahamat, he calls God Rahim.

00:31:10.625 --> 00:31:11.875
Rahamat means compassion,

00:31:12.208 --> 00:31:16.291
Rahim means the embodiment of compassion.

00:31:23.333 --> 00:31:27.208
One can’t understand these nations,

00:31:27.542 --> 00:31:29.834
what they have done of God and these incarnations,

00:31:30.208 --> 00:31:33.375
nobody can explain.

00:31:40.291 --> 00:31:44.500
Those who followed Buddha, like Japanese and Chinese,

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:47.750
what are they doing?

00:31:52.291 --> 00:31:54.917
We have some followers of Mahavira, they have become

00:31:55.208 --> 00:31:59.417
such extreme vegetarians that they try to save mosquitoes

00:31:59.792 --> 00:32:05.208
and all little worms on the street.

00:32:12.125 --> 00:32:14.792
They are so stupid that they make some bugs

00:32:15.125 --> 00:32:18.667
to suck the blood of a realized soul

00:32:18.959 --> 00:32:23.458
so that the bugs will get realized.

00:32:32.875 --> 00:32:36.125
This absurd vegetarianism - one should understand

00:32:36.417 --> 00:32:40.999
are we going to give Realization to chickens?

00:32:47.792 --> 00:32:51.917
We are more kind to animals and to our tables and chairs

00:32:52.291 --> 00:32:55.917
than to our own children.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.458
Human beings are going in the wrong direction.

00:33:08.959 --> 00:33:11.417
The right direction is to be in the center

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:16.625
and watch for the Last Ascent.

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.375
And when the Kundalini rises

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:28.709
She takes you through this gate of Christ,

00:33:28.999 --> 00:33:30.500
through Him alone it takes.

00:33:30.834 --> 00:33:33.250
That’s why I said through Him everybody has to pass

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:36.166
into the realm of Kingdom of God,

00:33:36.542 --> 00:33:40.208
which is the Limbic area within you.

00:33:56.667 --> 00:34:02.458
The super-ego and ego represent your past and future.

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:07.875
A thought rises and falls off and another thought rises

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:10.959
and falls off.

00:34:12.834 --> 00:34:16.500
One is a past, one is a future.

00:34:17.166 --> 00:34:22.625
Our mind jumps on the cusp of these thoughts.

00:34:25.208 --> 00:34:28.999
We have to be in the center of these two thoughts,

00:34:29.458 --> 00:34:34.000
which is the present, we have to be.

00:34:37.583 --> 00:34:39.625
But just by giving lectures and saying,

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.750
“Now you be in the center” , you just don’t become.

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:54.125
By giving lectures or giving badges or starting organizations

00:34:54.542 --> 00:34:57.834
or having some sort of a postcard with you

00:34:58.250 --> 00:34:59.750
attached on your head,

00:34:59.999 --> 00:35:03.917
you don’t become that.

00:35:13.125 --> 00:35:16.208
All honest seekers must know that this is all outside,

00:35:16.667 --> 00:35:21.667
it has nothing to do with inside.

00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:30.709
If you are true seekers and know that all these things

00:35:31.125 --> 00:35:34.792
are ego-pampering,

00:35:39.709 --> 00:35:43.542
and is very misleading.

00:35:45.709 --> 00:35:50.083
It is to be understood in its right perspective,

00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:56.667
in the proper wisdom of a human being.

00:36:01.667 --> 00:36:04.000
Now when you cross through your Agnya chakra

00:36:04.375 --> 00:36:08.625
you become thoughtlessly aware,

00:36:14.667 --> 00:36:20.542
because you establish your attention in the present.

00:36:27.458 --> 00:36:29.625
But again I have to tell you one thing

00:36:30.166 --> 00:36:31.417
that this is not a myth,

00:36:31.959 --> 00:36:33.625
it is an actualization that has to take place

00:36:34.125 --> 00:36:37.750
it has to happen within you.

00:36:41.959 --> 00:36:45.417
Your awareness has to be enlightened. It is not just saying,

00:36:45.834 --> 00:36:47.041
“I am an enlightened being” ,

00:36:47.291 --> 00:36:51.667
giving a false certificate to yourself.

00:36:58.875 --> 00:37:01.959
Then the Kundalini passes through the last chakra

00:37:01.959 --> 00:37:04.208
of the Sahasrara, 1000 petals,

00:37:04.792 --> 00:37:09.999
and opens out into the subtle energy of God,

00:37:10.417 --> 00:37:14.250
His love and His compassion.

00:37:25.291 --> 00:37:28.583
At this time, you are thoughtlessly aware,

00:37:29.083 --> 00:37:35.250
but you are in complete state of bliss and relaxation.

00:37:43.959 --> 00:37:47.166
You feel the All-pervading power for the first time

00:37:47.667 --> 00:37:52.125
as Cool Breeze.

00:37:54.375 --> 00:37:59.250
This is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:04.417
described in the Koran as “Ruh”,

00:38:06.542 --> 00:38:11.959
in the Indian scriptures as Chaitanya Lahari,

00:38:13.959 --> 00:38:18.500
means waves of consciousness.

00:38:19.625 --> 00:38:25.041
We can put waves of enlightened consciousness.

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:30.458
There are books and books written about it

00:38:30.875 --> 00:38:32.625
in Sanskrit language,

00:38:35.999 --> 00:38:39.625
but they are not translated.

00:38:40.417 --> 00:38:44.208
Some people who went to India to study Sanskrit,

00:38:48.125 --> 00:38:53.250
they were only interested in the loopholes of the culture.

00:38:55.125 --> 00:38:59.166
Like a thief is interested in all the weaknesses of a bank,

00:38:59.709 --> 00:39:01.583
they went there to study what they can get

00:39:02.083 --> 00:39:05.834
to support their weaknesses.

00:39:14.667 --> 00:39:19.542
In the late 6th century in our country, a big

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:26.208
revolt against God broke out as tantrism,

00:39:34.625 --> 00:39:40.125
where insulting the deity and - unholy behavior

00:39:40.959 --> 00:39:46.125
became the signs of tantrism.

00:39:50.458 --> 00:39:54.125
They behaved in such a manner that the -

00:39:55.083 --> 00:40:01.834
with the repulsion the deities disappeared.

00:40:04.208 --> 00:40:07.875
And they created an area around them where they could get

00:40:08.125 --> 00:40:12.291
all the negative satanic forces to handle.

00:40:17.625 --> 00:40:22.500
This is called as in Sanskrit language as bhoota vidya,

00:40:22.875 --> 00:40:26.583
preta vidya and all that which in short means

00:40:27.083 --> 00:40:30.875
the knowledge of the cemetry.

00:40:40.291 --> 00:40:43.667
Please don’t disturb others.

00:40:45.834 --> 00:40:50.417
Now this vidya was practiced, this science was practiced

00:40:50.917 --> 00:40:54.083
by people who wanted to entice and hypnotize people

00:40:54.458 --> 00:40:57.750
and make money.

00:41:05.333 --> 00:41:07.792
But the people who went there only studied these

00:41:08.041 --> 00:41:10.417
erotic and dirty things, which has no meaning

00:41:11.166 --> 00:41:14.667
to the philosophy there.

00:41:20.625 --> 00:41:23.542
I went to Nepal twice with My daughters;

00:41:23.875 --> 00:41:27.792
we never saw anything wrong there.

00:41:31.917 --> 00:41:35.291
But then one of the Sahaja Yogis told Me the Nepal is filled

00:41:35.667 --> 00:41:41.500
with these - the erotic images.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.125
I said, “Where are they? I can’t see.”

00:41:52.959 --> 00:41:58.250
“See there,” he said, “on top of the temple.”

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.500
All these Japanese had their zoom lenses

00:42:03.792 --> 00:42:06.583
put up there to see it.

00:42:10.875 --> 00:42:18.500
They had brought special type of ladders, you see,

00:42:20.041 --> 00:42:21.625
special type of ladders to climb up,

00:42:22.291 --> 00:42:27.709
to take the special photograph of the special brains.

00:42:38.917 --> 00:42:42.208
And the Nepalis told Me that these stupid people

00:42:42.625 --> 00:42:48.083
are doing something so unholy and unsanctified.

00:42:55.542 --> 00:42:59.125
They have no sense of holiness.

00:43:00.625 --> 00:43:02.125
And I said, “that’s not so.

00:43:02.458 --> 00:43:03.250
They have, but they have lost it now,

00:43:03.834 --> 00:43:05.083
they can make money out of it.”

00:43:13.583 --> 00:43:15.333
But they were surprised, they said,

00:43:17.875 --> 00:43:18.000
“Who is going to buy these inauspicious things in the house?

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.792
They’ll bring all bhoots in the house.”

00:43:29.375 --> 00:43:33.417
But these tantrikas had convinced these poor artists

00:43:33.917 --> 00:43:37.000
that you make such statues on top of the temple so

00:43:37.417 --> 00:43:43.999
so that the goddess of thunder is a virgin,

00:43:44.208 --> 00:43:48.999
ans she will never come near this,

00:43:48.999 --> 00:43:50.792
because it’s so dirty, you see.

00:44:09.959 --> 00:44:16.417
So, one has to understand that God is purity,

00:44:18.999 --> 00:44:21.959
He is sanctity,

00:44:23.875 --> 00:44:26.834
and He is Holy.

00:44:27.291 --> 00:44:29.500
He is Holy.

00:44:29.875 --> 00:44:34.542
Now, with this idea, now I’m going to tell you about

00:44:34.959 --> 00:44:39.333
the holiest and holiest that resides within you,

00:44:45.959 --> 00:44:49.125
the beauty that is within you,

00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:54.625
the bliss that resides within you,

00:44:56.625 --> 00:45:00.834
and the light that watches you.

00:45:03.625 --> 00:45:06.750
It is your Spirit.

00:45:07.333 --> 00:45:12.792
It is a reflection of God Almighty in your heart.

00:45:14.875 --> 00:45:20.709
And the Holy Ghost is the power of God Almighty.

00:45:25.542 --> 00:45:30.417
God is the witness of the play of the Holy Ghost.

00:45:32.583 --> 00:45:36.750
Christ’s Mother was Herself an incarnation of that,

00:45:40.417 --> 00:45:43.709
but it was not mentioned in the Bible because if these

00:45:43.999 --> 00:45:46.250
Romans or Jews had known that She is the One,

00:45:46.834 --> 00:45:51.999
they would have cut Her into pieces

00:45:59.625 --> 00:46:02.375
and attacked Her.

00:46:02.834 --> 00:46:08.000
So, it was not said because Christ had to play

00:46:08.375 --> 00:46:11.999
this drama of crucifixion.

00:46:16.999 --> 00:46:20.458
But you can find out after your Realization

00:46:20.792 --> 00:46:23.333
through your vibratory awareness that whatever I’m saying

00:46:23.834 --> 00:46:28.333
about them is absolute truth.

00:46:33.417 --> 00:46:36.291
Because your Spirit “which is the Absolute “

00:46:36.834 --> 00:46:40.500
gives you the absolute answers.

00:46:43.625 --> 00:46:46.709
It doesn’t give you relative answers.

00:46:49.667 --> 00:46:53.834
It takes you out of this relative world.

00:46:56.291 --> 00:47:00.583
And you know the absolute through your new awareness,

00:47:00.959 --> 00:47:04.291
which is vibratory awareness;

00:47:08.542 --> 00:47:13.792
we can say the sanctified awareness, the holy awareness.

00:47:15.417 --> 00:47:18.333
When this Kundalini rushes through this point,

00:47:22.999 --> 00:47:25.000
She enlightens the Spirit,

00:47:25.417 --> 00:47:30.458
because the seat of the Spirit is here.

00:47:33.208 --> 00:47:39.291
In our brain, all these seven centers are placed like this.

00:47:41.583 --> 00:47:46.625
All the seats of the centers are in the brain.

00:47:47.875 --> 00:47:51.875
So, when the Kundalini comes out of this center,

00:47:52.083 --> 00:47:57.000
all the centers get integrated,

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.625
because the Spirit integrates you.

00:48:07.291 --> 00:48:11.083
Like in the room, when you have no light you are fighting

00:48:11.417 --> 00:48:17.166
for different, different places, different, different things.

00:48:21.542 --> 00:48:23.417
But when there is light,

00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:27.667
you know where you stand with what.

00:48:31.625 --> 00:48:35.750
So the relativity is dropped out.

00:48:39.792 --> 00:48:43.333
But when you become the Spirit,

00:48:44.417 --> 00:48:47.458
your attention gets enlightened

00:48:47.792 --> 00:48:52.166
into collective consciousness: it becomes,

00:48:59.208 --> 00:49:05.291
because this Spirit in you is the collective being.

00:49:07.583 --> 00:49:12.625
Everybody’s Spirit is connected with each other.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:19.375
It gives a message which is the collective message.

00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:30.125
Now when you place your hands towards yourself and try

00:49:30.458 --> 00:49:35.750
to find out by putting your aura into a proper bondage,

00:49:36.041 --> 00:49:40.041
then you can find out about yourself.

00:49:48.875 --> 00:49:52.125
If it is a physical and a mental imbalance, then the right

00:49:52.458 --> 00:49:59.125
hand shows on the fingers different centers.

00:50:06.208 --> 00:50:11.792
And when it is an emotional problem, the left hand shows.

00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:18.709
All these vibrations you receive there in sensations

00:50:19.041 --> 00:50:24.250
are decoded and you can verify everything.

00:50:28.834 --> 00:50:30.417
Sitting down here,

00:50:30.417 --> 00:50:33.750
you can feel the vibrations of any person.

00:50:40.041 --> 00:50:45.208
The other day I said that Mozart was a born realized.

00:50:49.166 --> 00:50:53.667
So they said, “How do we know?”

00:50:55.041 --> 00:51:02.667
I said, “Just put your hands and think of Mozart” ,

00:51:03.291 --> 00:51:09.792
and immediately tremendous vibrations start flowing.

00:51:10.583 --> 00:51:13.542
When such realized souls play any music

00:51:14.041 --> 00:51:18.792
or paint any paintings, for a realized personality

00:51:19.125 --> 00:51:23.166
it is the greatest source of joy -

00:51:29.542 --> 00:51:33.041
because you don’t think about it.

00:51:33.792 --> 00:51:38.375
But the essence of the creator of that joy

00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:41.291
becomes one with yours.

00:51:47.999 --> 00:51:52.458
You feel the bliss flowing in you.

00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:59.999
And you enjoy it only for joy’s sake

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:06.208
because Spirit is the joy within you.

00:52:07.333 --> 00:52:10.792
Spirit is the joy, means it is neither happiness or

00:52:10.792 --> 00:52:17.000
unhappiness, but it is single thing, is joy.

00:52:21.041 --> 00:52:23.417
Happiness comes when your ego is pampered, and

00:52:23.709 --> 00:52:28.458
unhappiness comes when your super-ego suffers.

00:52:33.125 --> 00:52:35.667
You get out of the duality of these two and

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.625
you become the joy, which is singular,

00:52:38.959 --> 00:52:44.000
which is because you become the witness of the play.

00:52:48.291 --> 00:52:51.125
No more you are in it involved.

00:52:56.125 --> 00:52:58.959
Supposing you are in the water,

00:53:00.834 --> 00:53:04.458
then you have the fear of the drowning,

00:53:05.583 --> 00:53:09.041
because you see the waves around.

00:53:10.417 --> 00:53:14.500
But supposing you get into the boat

00:53:16.375 --> 00:53:21.291
and are established; you are established in the boat

00:53:22.166 --> 00:53:27.083
then you enjoy the same waves.

00:53:28.125 --> 00:53:32.125
That is the mastery you have to reach.

00:53:34.709 --> 00:53:37.083
Another very gross simile I’ll give you,

00:53:37.417 --> 00:53:41.583
but don’t carry too far with your mind.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:52.000
In a car you have a brake and an accelerator.

00:53:57.834 --> 00:54:04.375
In the same way we have the accelerator and the brake.

00:54:06.458 --> 00:54:12.667
The human driver tries to balance both of them.

00:54:15.166 --> 00:54:20.583
Then he becomes the expert driver.

00:54:21.834 --> 00:54:25.500
Then automatically he drives.

00:54:26.375 --> 00:54:30.917
Now the master is sitting at the back - that is the Spirit.

00:54:33.875 --> 00:54:36.999
Then this expert driver becomes the master and sees

00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:42.083
the driver in him drive.

00:54:48.792 --> 00:54:52.000
Now, when you see yourself as a third person,

00:54:52.375 --> 00:54:56.959
you are not involved in the joke.

00:55:00.959 --> 00:55:03.583
You must have seen some little children talk like that

00:55:03.875 --> 00:55:06.458
in a third person.

00:55:09.667 --> 00:55:15.166
Like they’ll say, “This John will not go there.”

00:55:16.834 --> 00:55:20.750
These days there are so many realized souls born in Europe

00:55:21.083 --> 00:55:26.250
and England, America that we must get Realization

00:55:26.875 --> 00:55:31.125
to look after them.

00:55:38.333 --> 00:55:43.792
There are great saints born on this earth.

00:55:45.834 --> 00:55:51.792
They talk another language of vibratory awareness.

00:55:54.875 --> 00:55:59.709
If they have a problem, they suck the finger to suggest.

00:56:05.417 --> 00:56:09.583
Many saints want to be born.

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:13.709
But in the countries where the children are not understood

00:56:13.999 --> 00:56:19.208
and respected and loved, they avoid it.

00:56:24.458 --> 00:56:27.959
All the Sahaja Yogis who are married now have got great

00:56:28.208 --> 00:56:34.583
saints born to them, tremendous people.

00:56:37.834 --> 00:56:41.291
That is how I would request you, all of you, to know that

00:56:41.542 --> 00:56:43.750
the time of Resurrection has come,

00:56:44.125 --> 00:56:48.083
the time of your judgment has come.

00:56:56.875 --> 00:56:59.542
That many people who asked Me one more question

00:56:59.875 --> 00:57:02.959
all the time that, “What about cleansing ourselves before

00:57:03.166 --> 00:57:08.000
coming to eat - we are not yet ready.”

00:57:15.166 --> 00:57:18.792
You don’t have to judge yourself.

00:57:20.166 --> 00:57:22.291
You have done all these things in your previous lives,

00:57:22.667 --> 00:57:26.500
you don’t have to do anymore now.

00:57:32.125 --> 00:57:35.125
Apart from this, we have to know that the One who has

00:57:35.458 --> 00:57:37.583
created this Universe is much more worried

00:57:38.083 --> 00:57:41.667
in saving this creation.

00:57:48.375 --> 00:57:53.166
All His aspects are busy there to help you out

00:57:56.250 --> 00:57:58.834
if He has to save His creation.

00:58:02.709 --> 00:58:06.458
He has to save human beings.

00:58:07.375 --> 00:58:10.500
And this blossom time has come where many flowers are

00:58:10.834 --> 00:58:14.750
going to become fruits.

00:58:18.875 --> 00:58:24.333
Sahaja Yoga has been there since times immemorial.

00:58:29.792 --> 00:58:32.375
All those who got Realization got through spontaneity,

00:58:32.709 --> 00:58:35.458
there’s no other way out -

00:58:39.375 --> 00:58:45.458
as every seed gets germinated through its living force.

00:58:48.542 --> 00:58:51.000
But on the tree of life, there were one or two flowers

00:58:51.291 --> 00:58:53.291
to begin with.

00:58:56.083 --> 00:59:00.417
But today there are many flowers.

00:59:01.417 --> 00:59:05.625
So it has to be an en-masse happening.

00:59:08.166 --> 00:59:11.041
Many of you who have been to India with Me have seen

00:59:11.375 --> 00:59:14.250
thousands of people getting Realization,

00:59:21.375 --> 00:59:23.041
because in the villages there are people

00:59:23.542 --> 00:59:27.166
who are not so complicated.

00:59:29.166 --> 00:59:36.834
And it will happen to so many people on this earth.

00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:40.583
A lady interviewer asked Me,

00:59:40.875 --> 00:59:45.792
“How will it go to people whom You do not meet?”

00:59:50.583 --> 00:59:53.208
It is very simple because when I was in Hong Kong,

00:59:53.625 --> 00:59:57.458
the lady who owned a television asked Me to stand up

00:59:57.750 --> 01:00:01.875
and give vibrations to people.

01:00:10.625 --> 01:00:13.999
And in that horrible, busy city many people got

01:00:14.208 --> 01:00:19.709
Realization through television.

01:00:21.792 --> 01:00:25.000
The science has developed so many things like a camera

01:00:25.625 --> 01:00:32.333
which can take a photograph and which has the vibrations.

01:00:37.625 --> 01:00:41.500
There are so many ways we can spread it much faster than

01:00:41.834 --> 01:00:44.542
Christ could have done it, or anybody could have done it

01:00:44.834 --> 01:00:48.792
in these Modern times.

01:00:53.417 --> 01:00:59.208
But it is difficult because it is becoming.

01:01:02.291 --> 01:01:06.458
People like a convenient type of a yoga.

01:01:10.208 --> 01:01:12.834
If you tell them to stand on their heads they’re happy.

01:01:16.875 --> 01:01:19.291
But if you tell them just, “You have to put your hands” ,

01:01:19.625 --> 01:01:23.291
they just don’t understand.

01:01:24.417 --> 01:01:29.500
But all the vital things of this world are done so simple,

01:01:29.834 --> 01:01:33.542
in such a simple manner.

01:01:37.792 --> 01:01:40.999
Apart from your evolution, your breathing, your seeing,

01:01:41.208 --> 01:01:45.291
everything is so simple.

01:01:49.208 --> 01:01:53.500
It is so vital, so it has to be simple.

01:01:55.041 --> 01:02:00.542
So people who like to have lots of mental fits

01:02:00.959 --> 01:02:06.000
with Sahaja Yoga find it difficult to accept.

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:14.125
I do not say that you close your brains or on the contrary,

01:02:14.417 --> 01:02:18.834
open it, completely.

01:02:19.709 --> 01:02:23.625
Logically reach the conclusions,

01:02:26.625 --> 01:02:29.667
not blindfolded,

01:02:29.959 --> 01:02:32.625
not blind faith.

01:02:33.166 --> 01:02:36.458
But once you have come to logical conclusion,

01:02:36.917 --> 01:02:40.375
you cannot do with this limited brain

01:02:46.208 --> 01:02:50.333
because you have to enter into the unlimited.

01:02:52.792 --> 01:02:58.166
And for that we have to leave this limited behind.

01:03:00.875 --> 01:03:08.875
But once you get enlightened, everything becomes logical.

01:03:10.041 --> 01:03:13.542
You can verify everything.

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:18.208
It is so simple, like to the blind people,

01:03:18.542 --> 01:03:21.667
we cannot tell about the colors, we can just say,

01:03:21.959 --> 01:03:26.792
“All right, let the eyes open then you can see.”

01:03:34.041 --> 01:03:39.750
And that is what is as simple as getting Self-Realization.

01:03:43.125 --> 01:03:45.625
There is no danger,

01:03:46.625 --> 01:03:48.792
no problem.

01:03:49.959 --> 01:03:51.583
May God bless you all!

01:03:51.959 --> 01:03:54.208
Today is the last day,

01:03:54.583 --> 01:03:59.250
and I thank you very much for giving Me this opportunity

01:03:59.625 --> 01:04:02.875
to be with you all, such great seekers,

01:04:03.709 --> 01:04:08.291
and I’m sure next year again I’ll come.

01:04:22.917 --> 01:04:25.709
Even if you don’t get your Realization today,

01:04:26.041 --> 01:04:29.750
you will all get it, we are going to start a center here

01:04:30.333 --> 01:04:36.375
and we already have a follow-up meeting.

01:04:46.041 --> 01:04:49.542
As there is no money involvement you people have to

01:04:49.917 --> 01:04:54.959
organize it yourself for Vienna, and Austria.

01:05:01.917 --> 01:05:04.792
And it is your own look-out.

01:05:06.625 --> 01:05:13.625
But you all can write to Me in London all your problems.

01:05:16.999 --> 01:05:18.917
So, may God bless you!

01:05:19.333 --> 01:05:21.959
Today is the last day, and if you want,

01:05:22.166 --> 01:05:24.917
you can ask questions for about five minutes or so,

01:05:25.458 --> 01:05:29.750
but better is to get to Realization.

01:06:01.542 --> 01:06:05.125
You people can come here on the staircase.

01:07:49.166 --> 01:07:50.959
I think some can come down

01:07:50.959 --> 01:07:54.792
because there are some more coming in.

01:08:07.166 --> 01:08:09.166
Come this side, please.

01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:14.875
Don’t stand in the door, come this side.

01:08:37.542 --> 01:08:40.999
As I have told you that this is your own.

01:08:41.291 --> 01:08:44.792
This is your own property.

01:08:50.458 --> 01:08:56.166
It’s just an enlightened light can enlighten another light.

01:09:00.583 --> 01:09:05.125
There is no obligation of any kind.

01:09:07.291 --> 01:09:11.125
As if on My finger is paining, and I rub it,

01:09:11.458 --> 01:09:14.208
there’s no obligation on My finger.

01:09:14.875 --> 01:09:19.999
As you are not the other, there is no other for Me.

01:09:20.291 --> 01:09:25.667
So if I am just pressing My finger and comforting it,

01:09:26.208 --> 01:09:31.792
there’s no obligation of any kind, I better do it.

01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:52.125
Now, whatever I just tell you, please listen to Me

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:56.125
and cooperate with Me, that’s all.

01:10:02.083 --> 01:10:06.333
First you must know that you have to have a cheerful

01:10:07.166 --> 01:10:09.041
temperament.

01:10:09.375 --> 01:10:13.875
There is nothing to be serious about it nor to be frivolous,

01:10:14.208 --> 01:10:16.750
but be cheerful, because you are going to have

01:10:17.083 --> 01:10:21.375
the last ascent now.

01:10:38.834 --> 01:10:43.125
Now, you put your hands towards Me in a very relaxed

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:46.959
way, keep them on your lap, but before that

01:10:47.250 --> 01:10:49.208
you better take out your shoes,

01:10:49.709 --> 01:10:52.959
because they are tight and they stop

01:10:53.917 --> 01:10:58.333
the connection with the Mother Earth.

01:11:22.999 --> 01:11:28.542
Also you can loosen if there’s something tight in your neck

01:11:28.834 --> 01:11:32.792
or on your waist, if there’s something very tight,

01:11:32.792 --> 01:11:35.959
means you should be comfortable.

01:11:43.999 --> 01:11:47.208
Or if there is any heavy necklace or anything,

01:11:47.999 --> 01:11:51.208
something that is weighing on the chakras -

01:11:51.208 --> 01:11:55.000
because very subtle thing it is.

01:12:09.166 --> 01:12:13.250
You can take out even your glasses - will be all right.

01:12:29.959 --> 01:12:31.792
Now everyone has to do it.

01:12:32.083 --> 01:12:36.875
Those who are not going to do it should go out.

01:12:42.291 --> 01:12:44.166
Everyone has to close the eyes.

01:12:44.542 --> 01:12:47.333
If somebody keeps eyes open, it disturbs the vibrations,

01:12:47.667 --> 01:12:51.291
so I request you in the interest of everyone be civil and

01:12:51.583 --> 01:12:54.709
you better go.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
You have to be also kind to yourself.

01:13:11.458 --> 01:13:16.250
Now, please close your eyes.

01:13:20.125 --> 01:13:26.625
And do not put any pressure of your attention be taken

01:13:27.291 --> 01:13:31.250
to any place. Just leave it loose.

01:13:43.125 --> 01:13:45.417
The concentration and all that is not to be done

01:13:45.834 --> 01:13:47.375
at all anywhere.

01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:49.667
Just leave your attention absolutely loose.

01:13:50.083 --> 01:13:53.834
Let it think, let it do what it likes.

01:13:57.792 --> 01:14:01.750
Don’t put any pressure on it - just now.

01:14:04.250 --> 01:14:08.625
And now you should know that the left hand of yours

01:14:09.125 --> 01:14:15.083
is the expression of your power of desire.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.667
And the right hand is the power of action.

01:14:31.917 --> 01:14:34.959
So we have to use the right hand for the action and left

01:14:35.375 --> 01:14:41.458
hand is kept towards Me, little stretched out fingers.

01:14:49.917 --> 01:14:54.417
And keep your hand very relaxed.

01:15:05.291 --> 01:15:10.041
Now, the right hand, as I’ve told you, that first we have to

01:15:10.375 --> 01:15:14.250
get rid of this so-called guilt-business from our minds,

01:15:14.625 --> 01:15:22.000
so it should be put at the left side of your neck -

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:25.417
from the front side.

01:15:38.417 --> 01:15:40.834
But don’t open your eyes and keep the left hand

01:15:41.125 --> 01:15:45.667
stretched towards Me straight -

01:15:48.542 --> 01:15:51.041
but on the lap.

01:15:52.166 --> 01:15:54.417
Now, by putting that you just say,

01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:59.375
“Mother, I’m not guilty.”

01:16:02.083 --> 01:16:07.500
Please say it again and again, “Mother, I’m not guilty.”

01:16:13.709 --> 01:16:17.166
That is important because that is one of the big problems

01:16:17.458 --> 01:16:21.999
in the Western countries.

01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:12.375
Now you put your right hand on your heart.

01:17:20.667 --> 01:17:21.625
And say,

01:17:27.583 --> 01:17:30.500
with full understanding and with your heart,

01:17:30.834 --> 01:17:37.333
ask a question, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

01:17:37.625 --> 01:17:43.291
Ask the question three times.

01:17:58.166 --> 01:18:02.000
On the heart - little higher it is.

01:18:02.583 --> 01:18:05.917
Heart is little higher, yes.

01:18:07.291 --> 01:18:10.041
Ask a question thrice.

01:18:10.667 --> 01:18:14.542
Because you are, but just ask a question.

01:18:39.917 --> 01:18:44.792
Now please put your right hand on the left side

01:18:45.083 --> 01:18:47.917
of your stomach.

01:18:53.417 --> 01:18:59.041
And ask a question, “Mother, am I my own master?”

01:19:12.208 --> 01:19:14.959
Say it ten times, please.

01:19:23.667 --> 01:19:25.875
“Am I my own guru?”  just ask.

01:19:26.208 --> 01:19:28.917
If you have gurus or anything, if there’s any conditioning,

01:19:29.250 --> 01:19:30.709
that will drop out immediately

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.959
because you are your guru.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.041
You don’t need any guru at all.

01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:54.667
When you become the guru, you don’t need the guru at all.

01:19:56.999 --> 01:20:00.792
So please ask with full confidence.

01:20:17.542 --> 01:20:20.999
What’s her name?

01:20:21.834 --> 01:20:24.000
See, this is the negativity, what is the need?

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:29.250
The wife is not going to be killed here.

01:20:30.041 --> 01:20:33.166
This is how they attack, you see?

01:20:33.667 --> 01:20:38.542
Better go now. Tell your husband to behave himself.

01:20:39.875 --> 01:20:43.875
You can’t disturb, you see. Let her go away.

01:20:44.166 --> 01:20:45.792
This is the thing, they are not civil even,

01:20:46.041 --> 01:20:51.125
they are not civil people. How can they get Realization?

01:20:51.583 --> 01:20:54.291
Very uncivil.

01:20:54.667 --> 01:20:56.792
All right, doesn’t matter.

01:20:57.083 --> 01:20:59.625
Forgive, forgive, forgive.

01:21:04.583 --> 01:21:06.834
Put your right hand again

01:21:06.917 --> 01:21:12.667
on the left side of your stomach and say ten times now,

01:21:12.999 --> 01:21:16.458
“Mother, I am the guru.”

01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:26.583
Now say please again,

01:22:27.041 --> 01:22:33.792
“My only desire is to become the Spirit.

01:22:39.792 --> 01:22:45.166
my pure desire is to become the Spirit,

01:22:50.083 --> 01:22:58.667
to become my own being, to become the Self,

01:22:59.417 --> 01:23:03.875
to become the Absolute.

01:23:12.083 --> 01:23:16.417
So let it manifest.”

01:23:46.917 --> 01:23:49.625
Now put the right hand again on your heart

01:23:54.959 --> 01:23:57.834
and say, “Mother, I am the Spirit.”

01:23:58.166 --> 01:24:00.542
Say it with full confidence that you are, believe Me.

01:24:00.917 --> 01:24:05.125
Put your feet straight on the Mother Earth, touching it

01:24:05.417 --> 01:24:10.542
straight, you see, don’t push forward your legs.

01:24:14.583 --> 01:24:17.542
Those who are sitting on the floor are all right;

01:24:17.834 --> 01:24:20.417
they don’t have to worry.

01:24:23.917 --> 01:24:28.291
So now on the heart you put it and say,

01:24:28.583 --> 01:24:32.083
“Mother, I am the Spirit.”

01:24:32.417 --> 01:24:36.000
Say it twelve times.

01:25:12.750 --> 01:25:14.125
Don’t feel guilty.

01:25:14.583 --> 01:25:18.166
Please, this is the only snag you have, all of you is

01:25:18.458 --> 01:25:20.250
that you are feeling guilty while saying it.

01:25:20.542 --> 01:25:26.750
Be confident, I’m saying you are the Spirit.

01:25:32.208 --> 01:25:34.834
Why do you judge yourself?

01:25:37.792 --> 01:25:40.875
Let the Divine judge you.

01:25:47.375 --> 01:25:50.125
So just say -

01:26:01.291 --> 01:26:04.542
without feeling guilty.

01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:14.959
All right, without feeling guilty say that,

01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:20.041
“If I have done anything wrong, forgive me.”

01:26:20.542 --> 01:26:21.667
You can say this to God,

01:26:21.999 --> 01:26:23.750
“Oh God, if I have done anything wrong,

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.041
please forgive me.”

01:26:25.041 --> 01:26:26.250
Without feeling guilty,

01:26:26.667 --> 01:26:31.000
because to take out your guilt I am just saying this.

01:26:57.291 --> 01:26:58.583
Better.

01:27:08.333 --> 01:27:12.500
Better. Still there.

01:27:14.542 --> 01:27:21.750
Now please put the right hand again on the left shoulder

01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:25.875
near the neck.

01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:33.834
And again say, please again say sixteen times now,

01:27:34.166 --> 01:27:35.500
“Mother, I’m not guilty.”

01:27:35.875 --> 01:27:38.792
Please say it.

01:27:52.125 --> 01:27:56.291
With no pity towards yourself, but with confidence.

01:28:15.250 --> 01:28:17.166
Hm, better.

01:28:52.542 --> 01:28:55.792
Now put your right hand

01:28:56.250 --> 01:28:59.875
on your forehead across and press it.

01:29:05.083 --> 01:29:12.333
Press the upper line of your hand - across.

01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:18.458
And say,

01:29:23.125 --> 01:29:28.333
“Mother, I forgive everyone.”

01:30:01.041 --> 01:30:03.125
Much better.

01:30:04.750 --> 01:30:09.208
Now put this hand on top of your head, on the fontanel

01:30:09.583 --> 01:30:16.709
bone, where it was a soft bone in your childhood,

01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:30.458
and try to feel the thickness of your head

01:30:30.792 --> 01:30:32.417
in the central part of your head,

01:30:32.709 --> 01:30:38.000
backwards, forwards, and try to press it.

01:30:44.417 --> 01:30:46.500
From the base of your hand you can press it,

01:30:46.917 --> 01:30:51.166
with the base of your hand you can press it.

01:31:01.166 --> 01:31:05.625
Try to press it, you can do it yourself.

01:31:07.959 --> 01:31:10.417
With the base, with the base of the hand.

01:31:11.709 --> 01:31:14.208
Now, very good.

01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:42.166
Now put the hand on top and see if there is

01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:45.834
cool breeze coming.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:54.875
Now you have to say, “Mother, I want my Realization” ,

01:31:55.458 --> 01:31:58.166
because I cannot cross your freedom,

01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:01.667
you have to ask for it.

01:32:29.291 --> 01:32:33.542
You can change over your hand.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.208
Put the right hand on your lap towards Me

01:32:37.542 --> 01:32:41.834
and the left hand on yourself.

01:32:50.125 --> 01:32:54.999
Move it up and down to see there is cool breeze blowing.

01:33:09.291 --> 01:33:12.834
You can go on changing your hand to find out.

01:33:18.041 --> 01:33:20.542
If there are journalists in this group,

01:33:20.917 --> 01:33:23.959
I would request them to take their Realization,

01:33:24.333 --> 01:33:29.250
otherwise they should not publish anything,

01:33:36.083 --> 01:33:41.208
because you can’t understand Sahaja Yoga without it.

01:33:43.709 --> 01:33:46.333
It is not a superficial thing.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:54.375
You have to get your Realization otherwise you will disturb

01:33:55.667 --> 01:33:59.625
or disudale or you can say, misguide the people,

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.792
who are seekers.

01:34:17.875 --> 01:34:22.792
Now, better, good. Many are getting it.

01:34:54.792 --> 01:34:58.625
Now put your both the hands towards Me,

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:07.458
and see if you are getting cool breeze.

01:35:09.667 --> 01:35:13.250
In your hands, don’t open your eyes,

01:35:15.959 --> 01:35:20.542
keep your neck straight.

01:36:52.125 --> 01:36:55.000
If you are feeling the cool breeze, well and good

01:36:55.375 --> 01:36:59.542
otherwise also it is perfectly alright,

01:36:59.792 --> 01:37:01.500
you please the eyes

01:37:01.792 --> 01:37:06.291
I will tell you how to rise your Kundalini, yourself.

01:37:20.999 --> 01:37:23.917
And now you should watch Me without thinking.

01:37:23.917 --> 01:37:25.291
Just put your hands like this.
