1
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:09,089
You are singing so beautifully.

2
00:00:15,671 --> 00:00:22,089
It seems your heart has opened after this Puja very much

3
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,463
and you’re singing like small children now.

4
00:00:36,671 --> 00:00:43,755
So sort of, all the conditionings we have had, all the ego also there,

5
00:00:44,963 --> 00:00:51,838
it seems now you have become very pure all these problems have gone away

6
00:01:01,797 --> 00:01:04,463
and you are enjoying yourselves.

7
00:01:09,671 --> 00:01:12,963
This is the best way, when we love ourselves,

8
00:01:13,047 --> 00:01:16,171
we know ourselves we become love.

9
00:01:27,047 --> 00:01:34,630
Because of so many pressures on us and so many norms we’ve got,

10
00:01:42,713 --> 00:01:45,089
which are artificial,

11
00:01:48,338 --> 00:01:52,880
and we think only if outside we are alright, it’s alright;

12
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:06,963
but truth flowing from within is so joyous.

13
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:19,296
You feel your capacity to love itself is so joyous,

14
00:02:25,296 --> 00:02:29,755
and capacity to give is also so joyous.

15
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:43,630
So the Shiva Puja meant that you become love and feel the joy of love.

16
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:00,546
You see when you love someone, if you love your child,

17
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:06,963
you’re not bothered as to how it looks or how it appears,

18
00:03:07,047 --> 00:03:08,671
you just love.

19
00:03:18,963 --> 00:03:25,213
And if you try to be attentive to somebody because his appearance is good

20
00:03:25,296 --> 00:03:29,089
or he’s superficially good, or his manners are good,

21
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,089
after some time you’ll be deceiving yourself.

22
00:03:45,588 --> 00:03:50,797
But if your inner being is beautiful

23
00:03:51,922 --> 00:03:57,047
then you will be happy with yourself first of all;

24
00:04:05,505 --> 00:04:09,254
because the source of joy is from within yourself.

25
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:15,546
You do not get it from others.

26
00:04:19,588 --> 00:04:27,380
So to cleanse yourself and to be open is the best way to enjoy life.

27
00:04:38,338 --> 00:04:42,005
Some people may laugh at you, some may make fun of you,

28
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:44,170
some may try to trouble you;

29
00:04:51,463 --> 00:04:55,254
but most of them will love you, because you are so pure,

30
00:04:59,922 --> 00:05:04,171
and you will be yourself at peace with yourself.

31
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:15,505
So the best thing is to have introspection to see yourself,

32
00:05:15,588 --> 00:05:17,755
whether you are love or not.

33
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,130
Like some people are conditioned

34
00:05:32,254 --> 00:05:35,671
and they want that this should be like this that should be like this,

35
00:05:35,755 --> 00:05:39,797
it should have been there, we should do this we should do that,

36
00:05:49,338 --> 00:05:53,630
we should organise like this, we should cook like this;

37
00:05:53,713 --> 00:05:58,838
I mean conditionings are there that according to them that’s something good.

38
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:11,047
And if that doesn’t happen then they are unhappy.

39
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:25,170
And some are right sided egoistical, they want to dominate others,

40
00:06:25,213 --> 00:06:28,963
if they cannot dominate then they are unhappy, they are angry.

41
00:06:41,296 --> 00:06:43,546
So they are miserable,

42
00:06:46,421 --> 00:06:48,630
so they make others miserable also.

43
00:06:51,213 --> 00:06:56,296
So the first type which is left sided makes himself miserable,

44
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:59,797
while the second type makes others miserable.

45
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,797
But both are wrong.

46
00:07:15,671 --> 00:07:19,546
You have no business to make yourself miserable,

47
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:28,171
because God has created you to be joyous and happy.

48
00:07:34,296 --> 00:07:41,463
So one should only know that you have to be the Spirit.

49
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:52,005
So all these conditionings will drop out, ego will drop out.

50
00:07:58,254 --> 00:08:03,963
But when we talk of Spirit we always think of something very dry.

51
00:08:12,922 --> 00:08:19,880
No it’s not at all, it is absolutely Love, Spirit is Love.

52
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:28,380
You can say the light of Spirit is Love.

53
00:08:32,338 --> 00:08:38,089
So it is important to understand that it’s the love only

54
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:42,963
that is emitting from your heart that will give joy to you.

55
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:58,005
Look at other people as you have to give them love.

56
00:09:08,797 --> 00:09:13,254
You’ll feel very powerful and the ‘bhoots’ and all the ‘badhas’ will run away.

57
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,296
Once you decide that I have to just love others,

58
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:34,713
all the conditioning will drop out.
