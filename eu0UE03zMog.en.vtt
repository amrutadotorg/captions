00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:03.999
Mother is one being on this earth

00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:07.083
who can actually give that Self-realization,

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:10.166
who can actually give you that enlightenment.

00:00:10.417 --> 00:00:13.333
No sitting in little rooms doing

00:00:13.542 --> 00:00:16.792
strange positions for months on end,

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:20.542
to purify yourself and get yourself to some higher plain,

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.583
no sitting down, repeating mantras endlessly on the hope that

00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:29.041
maybe one day you will reach some other state of consciousness,

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.959
or some other higher stage of development, evolution.

00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:38.834
Mataji can give you that realization this evening.

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:43.583
The only prerequisite is the desire for it

00:00:43.792 --> 00:00:48.458
and humility within yourself to be able to ask Her for it.

00:00:49.458 --> 00:00:54.959
I'll explain a little bit about this picture.

00:00:55.166 --> 00:01:00.333
As you'll see there are one, two, three, four, five, six, seven

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:05.667
different major centers marked in the diagram.

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:11.750
They represent what we call chakras,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.999
which are energy centers within the spinal column.

00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:20.583
Now they are not things that you can carve open a spine

00:01:20.834 --> 00:01:22.583
and see within them, they are

00:01:22.834 --> 00:01:24.667
subtle energy centers, in the same way

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:27.999
that you can't pull a television set apart and see the picture.

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:34.083
They're there, they exist, they affect our behaviour,

00:01:34.417 --> 00:01:38.166
our behaviour affects them, too, just as importantly.

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:45.333
They have been with us all the time, they are part of our absolute,

00:01:47.083 --> 00:01:51.834
inner structure, they are part of our absolute being.

00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:57.125
When a person is in the presence

00:01:57.333 --> 00:02:00.667
of a realized soul,

00:02:00.917 --> 00:02:05.834
such as Mataji Nirmala Devi, a process can occur,

00:02:06.083 --> 00:02:11.208
whereby the Kundalini, which is, if you like it's that

00:02:11.417 --> 00:02:14.999
tiny first energy that is created,

00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:18.417
and is placed within each living entity.

00:02:18.667 --> 00:02:20.667
And the Kundalini resides,

00:02:20.917 --> 00:02:25.625
in that triangiular area there, which is in us, the sacrum,

00:02:25.834 --> 00:02:29.625
the coccyx, that bone right at the bottom of the spine,

00:02:29.834 --> 00:02:32.333
that is where that energy resides.

00:02:32.583 --> 00:02:37.166
I don't know if you are aware of it, but

00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:40.834
the actual word itself, sacrum,

00:02:41.083 --> 00:02:45.750
means, is from the same root structure as the word sacred,

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:49.625
it's I mean, the very fact that that is the word we call it,

00:02:49.834 --> 00:02:51.917
means that somewhere back in our

00:02:52.166 --> 00:02:53.417
in our history, we knew

00:02:53.667 --> 00:02:57.333
that there was something very special about that particular bone.

00:02:58.166 --> 00:03:02.041
The Kundalini energy resides in there and

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.166
another thing about that bone is, if a person say is burned,

00:03:06.417 --> 00:03:10.000
that is the bone that remains right until the last,

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.500
it's the last bone to burn.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.500
It's just a quality about it, that it's very special.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.542
The Kundalini resides there

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.583
and that is the energy which when awakened

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.834
travels up through the different centers,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.125
all the way up through the spinal column itself and

00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:34.625
eventually when what we call enlightenment occurs,

00:03:34.834 --> 00:03:39.834
that energy actually comes out through the top of our heads.

00:03:40.083 --> 00:03:44.083
It might sound a little strange but you can feel that energy,

00:03:44.333 --> 00:03:48.750
and hopefully you'll all be able to feel it this evening.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.166
And you can feel it as a cool breeze.

00:03:52.417 --> 00:03:53.458
Now, you know,

00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:56.999
some people actually feel it like there's a little fan sitting

00:03:57.166 --> 00:04:00.166
on top of their head blowing a little jet of cool air out there.

00:04:00.417 --> 00:04:01.750
It happens.

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:04.250
You can't explain it in physical terms,

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.250
it's an actual event, it actually occurs.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.750
You can also feel this coolness across your palms.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.999
You may have heard of the breath of the Holy Spirit.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.458
That is what the cool breeze is.

00:04:21.667 --> 00:04:24.291
The Indians have a word for it,

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.417
called 'chaitanya', which again is a cool breeze.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.750
The Middle Eastern people have a word for it, it's called the 'ruh',

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:36.458
it is the cool breeze.

00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:40.500
It's a thing that unfortunately we in the West

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.500
haven't heard all that much about

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.125
because our pursuits over the last

00:04:45.333 --> 00:04:49.583
couple of thousands years have been basically material,

00:04:49.834 --> 00:04:53.583
whereas in a lot of other cultures, in a lot of other countries,

00:04:53.834 --> 00:04:56.500
the thing behind people's lives

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.999
isn't what material things they may own or may aquire or

00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:04.208
what intellectual pursuits they may follow. It is

00:05:04.417 --> 00:05:08.999
whether or not they are or can be connected with that

00:05:09.166 --> 00:05:13.750
primordial energy and that total energy which some people call God,

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:18.083
some people call the Spirit, whatever name you want to call it.

00:05:18.333 --> 00:05:21.750
Some cultures in the world are for years being trying to get

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:25.834
themselves aligned with that Spirit, aligned with that energy.

00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:29.999
We in the West have steered ourselves way away from there.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.000
However, obviously, there's plenty of people here,

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.834
who want to know a little more about it and want if they can to be

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.834
reconnected, cause it's what we all came for in the first place,

00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:44.834
with that energy.

00:05:45.083 --> 00:05:47.333
Now the way that Kundalini works

00:05:47.583 --> 00:05:50.583
is that first,

00:05:50.834 --> 00:05:54.583
it has to be awakened by

00:05:54.834 --> 00:05:57.834
the energies first in that,

00:05:58.083 --> 00:06:01.500
a little red four petaled chakra,

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.834
at the base there; it gives permission to the Kundalini or gives,

00:06:07.083 --> 00:06:09.083
gives notice to the Kundalini, that

00:06:09.333 --> 00:06:12.999
now is the time for it to be awakened.

00:06:13.583 --> 00:06:17.750
It stirs and passes up through...

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:20.999
The first chakra by the way, is called the Mooladhara chakra.

00:06:21.166 --> 00:06:25.709
Mooladhara means the root,

00:06:25.917 --> 00:06:27.834
the support of the root,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.417
all right? It's the actual thing that holds it, all

00:06:31.667 --> 00:06:36.417
the whole thing rests on, the whole thing has to grow out from.

00:06:38.417 --> 00:06:40.500
I'll explain right from the beginning too,

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.583
that another thing that occurs as the Kundalini awakens is

00:06:44.834 --> 00:06:48.750
you can actually, if you have a problem within yourself you can

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:50.999
find out where it is and do something about it

00:06:51.166 --> 00:06:54.834
because as you can see the colours correspond with colours

00:06:55.083 --> 00:06:56.667
we have drawn on the hands.

00:06:56.999 --> 00:07:00.583
You'll have to forgive us, in that all of the colours

00:07:00.834 --> 00:07:03.375
in the diagram aren't the correct ones for the

00:07:03.583 --> 00:07:07.000
actual chakras themselves, for the energy centers themselves.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.208
They've, we've, the chart was done in a little ignorance.

00:07:11.417 --> 00:07:14.834
We've since learned out how to correct it but we haven't quite

00:07:15.083 --> 00:07:17.542
finished doing it at the moment. However you get

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.333
the correspondance from the colours and as you can see this spot

00:07:21.583 --> 00:07:26.750
here, on the hand, is the same colour as that spot at the base

00:07:26.999 --> 00:07:31.417
of the spine which is the Mooladhara and if you hold your hands out,

00:07:31.667 --> 00:07:37.083
to Mataji for instance, you may feel a numbness or a tingling

00:07:37.333 --> 00:07:40.750
or something in the base of your palm,

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:45.834
which means that there is some problem in that particular chakra

00:07:46.166 --> 00:07:50.542
within your own subtle body and you can, if you have some problem,

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:54.834
you can proceed to do something about it and get rid of them.

00:07:55.083 --> 00:07:58.125
The Kundalini does the work for you. It gets rid of the problems.

00:07:58.333 --> 00:08:02.041
You just have to have it awakened and it starts to take care of you.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.834
It is as it were your own mother,

00:08:05.083 --> 00:08:08.834
it has loved you since the beginning of creation and we'll take,

00:08:09.083 --> 00:08:12.750
you know, now that you have the chance for it to be awakened within you

00:08:12.999 --> 00:08:17.166
it will, it will quite, you will notice,

00:08:17.417 --> 00:08:19.999
right from the beginning that it will start to look after you,

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:23.417
that there is this energy there that can take care of you on

00:08:23.667 --> 00:08:25.750
many, many, many levels.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.417
The Kundalini energy awakens, from the Mooladhara

00:08:29.667 --> 00:08:35.542
it goes up to that green center in the middle there first,

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.083
which we call the Nabhi chakra.

00:08:38.333 --> 00:08:41.291
Nabhi means navel. It is the chakra that is

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.500
behind the navel in the body. It has to do with...

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:49.458
They, they all have different qualities, all the chakras. This,

00:08:49.667 --> 00:08:52.500
the particular quality of the Nabhi chakra is

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:55.500
to do with our sustenance, to do with our,

00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:01.417
what we could call our dharma, the way we live.

00:09:01.667 --> 00:09:06.834
I mean it's, say for instance, a man drinks very heavily,

00:09:07.083 --> 00:09:11.999
gambles a lot, goes out with a lot of different women,

00:09:13.417 --> 00:09:18.250
indulges in different drugs perhaps. Any, any of those things,

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.166
they are not things that are going to destroy you

00:09:20.417 --> 00:09:24.500
but they are things that they are going to make it harder for you to

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
live a balanced life within yourself.

00:09:28.834 --> 00:09:31.750
And that has to do with this center here, with the Nabhi,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.625
with the dharma of the person.

00:09:33.834 --> 00:09:36.291
As the Kundalini awakens, it goes to that center and

00:09:36.625 --> 00:09:41.291
as it gets enlightened, those qualities of dharma -

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.375
the Indian word "dharma", we can call it right living,

00:09:44.583 --> 00:09:48.250
I think we might have heard of that term - whatever term we use,

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.667
that is the quality that comes from there

00:09:50.917 --> 00:09:54.166
and as the Kundalini passes through there and awakens that center,

00:09:54.417 --> 00:09:57.291
those qualities can start to come out in our own life.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.625
Then it drops back down to the orange coloured

00:10:00.834 --> 00:10:04.250
center there which we call the Swadhisthan.

00:10:04.583 --> 00:10:06.834
It has to do with creativity ...

00:10:07.083 --> 00:10:11.750
as an artistic activity,

00:10:11.999 --> 00:10:16.999
and it also as you can see is the beginning of that yellow line,

00:10:17.166 --> 00:10:21.750
all right?  Now that yellow line is one we use to denote

00:10:22.083 --> 00:10:26.667
what is called the right hand sympathetic nervous system. All right?

00:10:26.917 --> 00:10:30.000
Now we all have heard about the sympathetic nervous system.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:33.041
We have, on the diagram there, you'll see the yellow line,

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:35.750
the white line and the blue line. The yellow line,

00:10:35.999 --> 00:10:39.333
is the right side sympathetic nervous system. It has to do with

00:10:39.583 --> 00:10:45.417
activity, with the future, with planning, with

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.333
the ego eventually. As you can see it passes all the way through,

00:10:50.583 --> 00:10:54.834
right up until it actually crosses over this center here,

00:10:55.083 --> 00:10:58.750
and ends up on this section of the head here,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.583
which is where what

00:11:01.834 --> 00:11:05.250
we call ego resides.

00:11:05.583 --> 00:11:08.834
It's a thing we've all got, it's a thing that's been necessary

00:11:09.166 --> 00:11:11.999
to us to have, to get to the stage of development

00:11:12.166 --> 00:11:14.458
that we have reached, internally.

00:11:14.667 --> 00:11:18.166
I mean we have been involved in a growth process,

00:11:18.417 --> 00:11:20.542
in a, in an evolutionary process,

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:24.083
that's finally brought us to the stage we are now:

00:11:24.583 --> 00:11:26.583
Mental capacities have grown,

00:11:26.834 --> 00:11:29.375
we have our physical capacities evolved,

00:11:29.583 --> 00:11:32.417
you know, we slowly evolved to the point we are now.

00:11:32.667 --> 00:11:36.542
We are at the purple coloured center there which we call

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:41.750
the Sahasrar, which is when the human being

00:11:41.999 --> 00:11:44.166
is evolved that stage,

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.125
it is possible for that chakra to be opened.

00:11:47.333 --> 00:11:48.834
And it is at that point

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.417
that the connection with the All Pervading occurs, with

00:11:53.667 --> 00:11:57.500
the Divine, the connection with the Divine occurs.

00:11:57.917 --> 00:12:01.333
It happens at that center and to get there we have to

00:12:01.583 --> 00:12:04.250
go all the way through all of the chakras, right?

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:08.834
So we go from the Swadisthan, the active principle there,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.291
the creative side, and from the Swadhisthan,

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:16.834
we pass across that large green area, which is the Void,

00:12:17.083 --> 00:12:19.500
we could call it the ocean of illusion,

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:22.417
if you like. It's all of the things that are around us all the time,

00:12:22.667 --> 00:12:23.667
and trying to distract us,

00:12:23.917 --> 00:12:27.291
all the things that are taking our attention away from

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:30.041
what we really are, what we are really seeking,

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:34.083
all of those things. And as we evolve, as we sort of discard,

00:12:34.333 --> 00:12:38.250
all of the different divertions, you know, you may follow one path

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.999
for years and years and years and finally after

00:12:41.166 --> 00:12:43.583
getting an extremly bitter taste in your mouth, eventually

00:12:43.834 --> 00:12:45.750
you think, "All right. I've had enough of that one.

00:12:45.999 --> 00:12:47.625
It hasn't reached me what I wanted,

00:12:47.834 --> 00:12:49.834
I'm going to try something else".

00:12:50.083 --> 00:12:53.291
Now we do that not just for one or two years

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.750
but we do that for lifetime, after lifetime, after lifetime,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.667
to the point where we finally sort ourselves out

00:12:59.999 --> 00:13:04.417
and to the point where we finally get to where you are now

00:13:04.667 --> 00:13:08.417
which is coming to a meeting hopefully

00:13:08.667 --> 00:13:11.250
to find something out about Kundalini hopefully,

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.999
to gain enlightenment, which is the thing that we are all seeking,

00:13:15.166 --> 00:13:16.583
it's the thing we have all -

00:13:16.834 --> 00:13:19.917
that has been driving us right from the beginning of creation

00:13:20.083 --> 00:13:21.750
that's what it´s about, you know.

00:13:21.999 --> 00:13:26.083
In the same way that the destiny of a tree is to flower,

00:13:26.333 --> 00:13:30.625
bear fruit, and keep on growing. Our destiny is to flower,

00:13:30.834 --> 00:13:36.500
bear fruit and keep on growing into Spiritual human beings which is,

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:40.250
when Jesus spoke of the kingdom of heaven on earth,

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:44.500
that's what in fact He was talking about, it's when,

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:48.000
not in some strange after life but when we actually

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:53.083
dwelled with God, if you call it God, on earth.

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:55.375
Now that's something that is possible,

00:13:55.583 --> 00:13:57.583
it is something that is promised.

00:13:57.834 --> 00:13:59.834
I mean not just one culture but

00:14:00.083 --> 00:14:03.834
you know, culture after culture, after culture,

00:14:04.083 --> 00:14:07.375
guru after guru, after guru, teacher after teacher,

00:14:07.583 --> 00:14:11.166
has promised that at some stage in the human development,

00:14:11.417 --> 00:14:15.750
it would be possible for that connection with the Spirit to occur,

00:14:15.999 --> 00:14:20.250
that it would be possible to live with the Divine on earth.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:24.375
It was the promise of Jesus Christ, Mohammed spoke of it,

00:14:24.583 --> 00:14:29.500
Buddha spoke of it. Buddha didn't speak of the Divine. He spoke of

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:34.000
the One, He spoke of, you know, freedom from all of the toils and

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:39.000
troubles but it's the same process. Buddha we actually find-

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:42.834
is the ruler of that yellow section in the top of the head,

00:14:43.083 --> 00:14:44.083
of the ego.

00:14:45.417 --> 00:14:49.667
He grew to show us that development.

00:14:49.999 --> 00:14:54.083
Jesus Christ by the way resides in the center,

00:14:54.333 --> 00:14:58.083
in what we call the Agnya chakra. I'll go back down to

00:14:58.333 --> 00:15:01.834
the large green, or where we have the three green dots

00:15:02.083 --> 00:15:06.583
in the center there, that is the Heart chakra, where the heart is,

00:15:06.999 --> 00:15:10.125
Anahat, as some people call it, cause of the sound Anahat

00:15:10.333 --> 00:15:13.750
is like the sound of the heart.

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:18.999
That is where the Spirit resides - within the heart.

00:15:19.166 --> 00:15:22.834
I mean we can't feel joy, we can't feel love,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.583
we can't, you know, they are all qualities of the heart.

00:15:27.834 --> 00:15:31.834
And eventually the thing we have to realize and eventually

00:15:32.083 --> 00:15:37.250
the thing we discover is that God is love

00:15:37.583 --> 00:15:42.333
and that that love is what is behind absolutely everything,

00:15:42.583 --> 00:15:46.083
absolutely it is the, it is the thing out of

00:15:46.333 --> 00:15:50.834
which the whole of creation has grown, is that love, and we all have

00:15:51.083 --> 00:15:54.333
a tiny bit of that within us,

00:15:54.583 --> 00:15:58.750
actually it resides in our heart.

00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:03.000
If the heart stops, the life stops. It's where it is.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:09.000
Now what happens, is as the Kundalini rises it awakens that center

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:12.917
again we have the next center, the Vishuddhi chakra.

00:16:13.166 --> 00:16:17.083
That has to do with communication,

00:16:17.333 --> 00:16:22.417
with our self esteem, with -

00:16:24.208 --> 00:16:27.000
it's sort of where we finally get to be human too

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:32.417
in a lot of ways. It's this center here and that chakra was opened

00:16:32.667 --> 00:16:35.166
at the stage when the human being

00:16:35.417 --> 00:16:39.166
grew from the ape, who had his head bowed,

00:16:39.417 --> 00:16:42.458
to the man who had his head raised.

00:16:42.667 --> 00:16:47.500
It's a very, very important stage in our evolution,

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:52.417
it's you know, it may seem only a little thing on one level but

00:16:52.667 --> 00:16:56.458
to actually it's the break from being an animal to being a human

00:16:56.667 --> 00:16:59.291
occurs at that point. And it is that point

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:03.917
that we start to communicate where we have words, where we have

00:17:04.166 --> 00:17:07.125
gestures, where we have facial expressions,

00:17:07.333 --> 00:17:11.125
all of those things actually start to operate from this chakra here,

00:17:11.333 --> 00:17:13.166
the Vishuddhi chakra.

00:17:13.417 --> 00:17:15.417
And the Kundalini passes through there,

00:17:15.709 --> 00:17:18.583
and to the - what's called the Agnya chakra.

00:17:18.834 --> 00:17:22.166
Some people might call it the 'third eye'.

00:17:22.417 --> 00:17:25.667
It is a third eye in a sense but it's an inward looking eye,

00:17:25.917 --> 00:17:30.500
that's not one that you look out through.

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:33.583
It is where Jesus Christ resides.

00:17:33.834 --> 00:17:38.500
When we have the words of Christ,

00:17:38.834 --> 00:17:42.834
that "You must pass through Me to get to My Father",

00:17:43.083 --> 00:17:46.083
that is precisely what He is talking about.

00:17:46.333 --> 00:17:48.667
You have to pass through that center.

00:17:48.917 --> 00:17:51.417
You have to get as it were the "o.k."

00:17:51.667 --> 00:17:56.542
from Jesus that you may pass, that the Kundalini energy may pass

00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:01.000
through there and may pass into the Sahasrara, where,

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:07.166
this center, the crown, will open and connect you

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:10.834
with the Divine.

00:18:11.166 --> 00:18:14.500
The quality of that chakra,

00:18:14.792 --> 00:18:19.750
one we tend to forget in the so-called christian countries,

00:18:19.999 --> 00:18:22.500
is the quality of forgiveness.

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:25.834
I don't think we can have any greater lesson

00:18:26.083 --> 00:18:30.333
than that of Jesus, the Lord Himself,

00:18:30.583 --> 00:18:33.250
as He was being crucified, saying,

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.999
"Forgive them, Father, for they know not what they do".

00:18:36.166 --> 00:18:41.417
I mean, there He was, was the most powerful being in creation

00:18:41.709 --> 00:18:44.834
who could have.. who could have destroyed

00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:48.667
everyone and everything. He was there,

00:18:48.999 --> 00:18:54.500
begging His Father that His murderers be forgiven,

00:18:54.792 --> 00:18:58.667
and it's an incredible thing, it's, you know, I mean, a human being

00:18:58.999 --> 00:19:04.291
can only ever aspire to that wisdom and to that absolute love,

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.999
cause that's what it came from when He said that.

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:14.000
And that is the quality of the Agnya chakra.

00:19:14.291 --> 00:19:16.417
People may find,

00:19:16.667 --> 00:19:20.834
they get headaches a lot, that they worry a lot,

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.999
that there's a whole lot of mental activity.

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:26.083
Anything to do with this center here,

00:19:26.333 --> 00:19:31.999
tends to pass, if somewhere within yourself you can find out

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:34.583
who it is that you haven't forgiven.

00:19:34.834 --> 00:19:36.041
Might be yourself, you know,

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:37.999
you might be incredibly hard on yourself.

00:19:38.166 --> 00:19:40.667
One of the hardest things to do is to forgive yourself,

00:19:40.999 --> 00:19:43.750
for all of the things that you feel you may or may not have done.

00:19:43.999 --> 00:19:48.417
Is to turn around and say, "o.k., you are forgiven" , you know ...

00:19:48.667 --> 00:19:52.500
end of it. And as that quality of forgiveness starts

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:56.750
to come into our own lives, the Agnya chakra itself,

00:19:56.999 --> 00:20:01.500
begins to work more fully and to give its blessings to us.

00:20:01.834 --> 00:20:07.000
At the Sahasrar, what is called the thousand petalled lotus

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:12.083
in Indian religious teaching,

00:20:12.333 --> 00:20:16.750
is where all of the qualities of all of the chakras

00:20:16.999 --> 00:20:21.834
are merged into one, and our balance starts.

00:20:22.083 --> 00:20:25.333
There actually,

00:20:26.999 --> 00:20:30.250
each particular center as it were, has its seats

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.834
on the actual head itself

00:20:34.083 --> 00:20:38.583
and they all move up to actually like,

00:20:38.834 --> 00:20:41.083
not like the United Nations but

00:20:41.333 --> 00:20:43.999
they all converge in the one area

00:20:44.166 --> 00:20:46.999
and can govern your life from there,

00:20:47.166 --> 00:20:51.000
with peace and freedom.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:58.250
You'll see, I've spoken about the yellow side, the right hand side -

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:03.834
ah, here is Mother, Mother, Mataji now. She will speak with us.

00:21:10.834 --> 00:21:14.166
So go ahead. I'll speak after.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:20.417
I was just about to speak about the left hand side.

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:27.250
It is the side of the past,

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:32.166
of our memories, of our conditioning,

00:21:32.417 --> 00:21:35.500
of why we look back at all the things that we used to do and

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:39.417
think about why can't we be like that now, all of those things.

00:21:39.667 --> 00:21:44.166
They are things, qualities, on the left hand side.

00:21:44.417 --> 00:21:48.500
Now, we can dissapear right out in the left hand side,

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:51.208
into what's called the subconscious,

00:21:51.417 --> 00:21:53.458
into what's called the collective subconscious.

00:21:53.667 --> 00:21:55.375
We are not only dealing with our past,

00:21:55.583 --> 00:21:58.667
we are dealing with the past of many, many, many people.

00:21:58.875 --> 00:22:01.333
And we can get very lost in that area.

00:22:01.583 --> 00:22:04.125
In the same way that when we go too far on the other side,

00:22:04.333 --> 00:22:06.667
on the right hand side, into the future.

00:22:06.917 --> 00:22:11.166
We get into the areas where again we lose control,

00:22:11.417 --> 00:22:13.583
where we, we don't know who we are,

00:22:13.834 --> 00:22:18.750
where we get joined in with all of the egos and all of the futures

00:22:18.999 --> 00:22:23.166
of many, many, many other people, aside from ourselves, and we can

00:22:23.417 --> 00:22:26.166
what we call the supraconscious, the collective supraconscious,

00:22:26.417 --> 00:22:29.083
we can get lost into that area also.

00:22:29.333 --> 00:22:30.083
However,

00:22:30.333 --> 00:22:33.500
as you can see there is that pure line up through the center,

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:35.458
which is the central nervous system,

00:22:35.667 --> 00:22:37.458
the parasympathetic nervous system,

00:22:37.667 --> 00:22:41.041
which is where the Kundalini will pass,

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:44.750
and where that energy can bring us back towards the center,

00:22:44.959 --> 00:22:47.083
bring us back towards the point,

00:22:47.333 --> 00:22:49.750
where finally it will pass through all the chakras

00:22:49.999 --> 00:22:52.834
and through the Sahasrar, giving us enlightenment

00:22:53.083 --> 00:22:55.166
and giving us the union with the Divine,

00:22:55.417 --> 00:22:59.166
which is what we are seeking, Mother.

00:23:07.875 --> 00:23:11.500
Ladies and gentlemen, I have great pleasure in introducing to you,

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:16.542
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. She has come to Melbourne,

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:19.917
and I think probably the most important thing that,

00:23:20.166 --> 00:23:22.750
at a material level that She's managed to bring for all of us

00:23:22.999 --> 00:23:25.333
is this beautiful rain.

00:23:25.625 --> 00:23:28.083
As She drove in from the airport today,

00:23:28.333 --> 00:23:31.000
somebody said to Her: "Mother we need rain", so

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:33.166
She just put Her attention to it and

00:23:33.417 --> 00:23:35.583
the heaven seemed to have opened tonight.

00:23:35.875 --> 00:23:37.500
But at the much more subtle level,

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:40.667
She's able to give us far more as Bill has been saying,

00:23:40.999 --> 00:23:44.250
She's able to give us the experience of Self-realization.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:47.333
We've come to that point in our evolution where we have to

00:23:47.583 --> 00:23:52.917
make that final ascent and become a higher being,

00:23:53.291 --> 00:23:57.542
a being which becomes one with God,

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:01.166
a being which becomes a subtler being, which

00:24:01.417 --> 00:24:04.166
not only responds to those things,

00:24:04.417 --> 00:24:07.834
which we traditionally call our ego

00:24:08.125 --> 00:24:10.583
or our superego, which is really our subconscious,

00:24:10.834 --> 00:24:14.333
but we respond to the nature of the Spirit, which is eternal,

00:24:14.583 --> 00:24:16.750
but which is sleeping within us.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.500
After Self-realization,

00:24:18.834 --> 00:24:24.750
this energy of Kundalini rises and with the Spirit,

00:24:25.125 --> 00:24:29.000
puts you in touch with the all pervading Spirit of God.

00:24:29.333 --> 00:24:32.333
And at that moment when, it passes through the Sahasrar,

00:24:32.583 --> 00:24:36.917
this chakra at the top of the head, you become one with God.

00:24:37.083 --> 00:24:39.750
You become a realized soul, you become a "pir",

00:24:39.999 --> 00:24:43.667
as it refers to in the Muslim scriptures.

00:24:43.959 --> 00:24:48.000
You become [pa] as it's said in the Hindu scriptures.

00:24:48.417 --> 00:24:52.750
It's there and it happens, it's an experience.

00:24:53.083 --> 00:24:56.291
And yet, one might ask why is it so easy and how do

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.999
such a large number of people get it.

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:03.250
I've seen six thousand people get it in a meeting in India.

00:25:03.542 --> 00:25:06.208
There are very few people here tonight but at some of the meetings,

00:25:06.417 --> 00:25:08.834
which Shri Mataji conducts,

00:25:09.083 --> 00:25:13.166
even in recently last night and the night before in Adelaide,

00:25:13.417 --> 00:25:18.500
three and four hundred at a time get their Self-realization.

00:25:19.083 --> 00:25:23.999
It happens enmass because the grace of God is overflowing now.

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:28.000
And here on the earth is somebody who gives an enlightened light,

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:32.417
who can give it freely, to everyone.

00:25:32.667 --> 00:25:35.834
Just in Her presence the Kundalini awakens,

00:25:36.083 --> 00:25:39.250
just by merely stretching your hands out towards Her.

00:25:39.542 --> 00:25:45.083
That subtlety that lies within you is awakened and all your seeking,

00:25:45.333 --> 00:25:50.417
over your many, many lives is rewarded at this moment.

00:25:50.709 --> 00:25:56.417
You've been drawn here in a very, very, extraordinary way.

00:25:56.667 --> 00:26:01.333
It's no accident that all of you are here tonight.

00:26:01.625 --> 00:26:04.834
It's the reward of your seeking as I said. So,

00:26:05.083 --> 00:26:07.417
in a very humble way, but

00:26:07.625 --> 00:26:09.625
remaining scientific to the extent

00:26:09.834 --> 00:26:12.166
that you keep an open mind about it,

00:26:12.417 --> 00:26:14.250
I suggest that

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:18.667
you listen to what Mataji has to say but more than that you,

00:26:18.999 --> 00:26:22.125
allow yourself to experience the cool vibrations,

00:26:22.333 --> 00:26:24.417
that were refer to in the Christian scriptures

00:26:24.667 --> 00:26:26.834
as the cool wind of the Holy Spirit,

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.458
which Mohammed said would be flowing in the hands.

00:26:31.667 --> 00:26:37.834
In fact he said, at this time of resurection, your hands will speak.

00:26:38.667 --> 00:26:42.250
The Hindu scriptures, many, many of them have said it,

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:48.875
Adi Shankaracharya in the sixth century, spoke very, very eloquently

00:26:49.041 --> 00:26:53.333
about the chaitanya, which again is this cool vibrations,

00:26:53.583 --> 00:26:55.041
which we feel on the hands,

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:57.834
and which we feel coming from the top of the head.

00:26:58.125 --> 00:27:02.083
So as Bill has explained the subtle centers within us,

00:27:02.333 --> 00:27:03.750
as he's explained the left side and

00:27:03.999 --> 00:27:05.999
the right side of our subtle body,

00:27:06.166 --> 00:27:10.083
in other words as he's explained the mechanism that lies within,

00:27:10.333 --> 00:27:14.250
now, really all that has to happen is, you have to get it.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.834
And as you get it, you can give it to others.

00:27:18.125 --> 00:27:22.500
This is the great joy of Self-realization,

00:27:22.917 --> 00:27:25.250
since the advent of Shri Mataji.

00:27:25.583 --> 00:27:30.333
So when you get it, you should develop it,

00:27:30.583 --> 00:27:33.917
when you develop it you'll find that all your physical and emotional

00:27:34.083 --> 00:27:38.333
and mental problems will dissolve. But that's only a by-product.

00:27:38.625 --> 00:27:41.583
And then of course you have to give it to others.

00:27:41.959 --> 00:27:45.125
Because as you get the blessings of God, so too,

00:27:45.333 --> 00:27:47.834
those blessings must be given to others.

00:27:48.083 --> 00:27:52.750
Sahaja Yoga is not a club, it's not a cult, it's not an organization

00:27:52.999 --> 00:27:55.583
and you certainly you can't pay any money for it.

00:27:55.959 --> 00:27:56.792
And yet,

00:27:56.999 --> 00:28:02.166
quietly but very encouragingly it is growing throughout the world.

00:28:02.417 --> 00:28:05.291
I have just arrived in Australia with Shri Mataji

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:09.000
as part of a world tour that She is conducting this year,

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:12.750
throughout England, the whole of Europe, South East Asia.

00:28:12.999 --> 00:28:16.834
She's been through India along with about sixty of us,

00:28:17.125 --> 00:28:22.750
us - meaning the Australians, English, French, German, Italian,

00:28:22.999 --> 00:28:27.333
American, Canadian, all sort of nations have been

00:28:27.583 --> 00:28:30.667
with Her watching the miracle of Sahaja Yoga, spreading

00:28:30.917 --> 00:28:34.458
throughout India. But we are watching its spread towards the West,

00:28:34.667 --> 00:28:36.500
and it's catching on like wild fire.

00:28:36.792 --> 00:28:40.500
Catching on meaning, people are getting their Self-realization and

00:28:40.792 --> 00:28:44.083
developing it, and becoming complete beings,

00:28:44.291 --> 00:28:49.083
getting their inner satisfaction, their inner joy,

00:28:49.417 --> 00:28:51.375
and knowing that they reached the goal

00:28:51.583 --> 00:28:54.250
that they've been seeking over their many lives.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:29:00.250
Mataji is the wife of an eminent diplomat,

00:29:00.458 --> 00:29:04.000
he's the Secretary General of the United Nations Organizations,

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:09.999
United Nations Organization, International Maritime Organization.

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:15.917
She's a housewife, She's a mother, She's a grandmother.

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:20.625
She's well-known as the daughter of the Salve family in India,

00:29:20.834 --> 00:29:24.417
who were freedom fighters of the time of Gandhi

00:29:24.709 --> 00:29:28.667
and that period when the British rule came to an end.

00:29:28.999 --> 00:29:30.667
She's the sister of the Cabinet Minister

00:29:30.917 --> 00:29:33.999
in the Indira Gandhi government.

00:29:34.166 --> 00:29:38.166
So She's very well-known at the international level but

00:29:38.417 --> 00:29:40.583
that level She plays down,

00:29:40.834 --> 00:29:44.333
that level She's not really so interested in.

00:29:44.542 --> 00:29:47.667
That which She is interested in is the Spirit.

00:29:47.999 --> 00:29:53.583
In Her very warm, in Her very loving, in Her very tender way,

00:29:53.875 --> 00:29:59.750
Her devotees, those people who gained their Self-realization,

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:04.375
are those to whom She devotes Her greatest attention.

00:30:04.583 --> 00:30:10.000
So, whether you know Her in person, in the physical sense,

00:30:10.291 --> 00:30:14.333
or whether you gain your Self-realization even from Her photograph,

00:30:14.625 --> 00:30:19.583
doesn't matter. Her blessings pour towards you

00:30:19.792 --> 00:30:22.458
and through you, and slowly you start

00:30:22.667 --> 00:30:26.583
to feel that bliss and that joy that have been spoken of

00:30:26.834 --> 00:30:30.417
so eloquently and so widely in all the scriptures.

00:30:30.667 --> 00:30:32.709
It sounds too good to be true.

00:30:32.917 --> 00:30:35.500
I must admit it sounds too good to be true.

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:39.083
So again I say, be open minded,

00:30:39.333 --> 00:30:43.750
even be scientific, keep it as a hypothesis at first.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.667
See that you feel the cool wind.

00:30:45.999 --> 00:30:47.583
Don't mistake it for the air conditioning.

00:30:47.834 --> 00:30:49.834
It's a quite different coefficient.

00:30:50.125 --> 00:30:55.917
You feel the cool vibrations over and through,

00:30:56.166 --> 00:31:00.250
and almost as if flowing through the body.

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:03.417
You feel it in a very, very subtle way.

00:31:03.667 --> 00:31:05.750
Your ego will say, "Is it the wind that's blowing

00:31:05.999 --> 00:31:08.999
from the air conditioner?" It's not like that at all.

00:31:09.208 --> 00:31:11.458
We've been in rooms which have been absolutely

00:31:11.667 --> 00:31:13.250
without air conditioning.

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.583
We've been in halls like this which are completely sealed.

00:31:16.834 --> 00:31:18.083
It makes no difference.

00:31:18.333 --> 00:31:20.999
But you have to feel those cool vibrations.

00:31:21.166 --> 00:31:23.667
But if you don't feel it, don't be too dissapointed,

00:31:23.959 --> 00:31:29.000
because Shri Mataji will probably work on the centers a little,

00:31:29.333 --> 00:31:31.667
help to clear the centers a little,

00:31:31.999 --> 00:31:34.583
explain to you what might be the problem,

00:31:34.834 --> 00:31:39.750
and generally assist you, in the experience of Self-realization.

00:31:39.999 --> 00:31:42.500
So without any further introduction from me,

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:46.417
it gives me great pleasure to again introduce to you, in Melbourne,

00:31:46.625 --> 00:31:50.417
Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:32:07.625 --> 00:32:12.750
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.667
We have to understand

00:32:17.917 --> 00:32:23.834
that God has created us as human beings with a purpose.

00:32:24.333 --> 00:32:27.000
But in those modern times,

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:29.333
when we don’t even believe in God,

00:32:29.583 --> 00:32:34.250
or on a, in a Creator, or any such energy that exists,

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:36.625
it’s very hard to talk of God

00:32:36.834 --> 00:32:38.834
and to introduce

00:32:39.083 --> 00:32:43.583
Him to be the One who has made us human beings.

00:32:43.834 --> 00:32:47.250
But even Darwin

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:50.834
said that if man has come so far

00:32:51.083 --> 00:32:56.417
he will have to go a little further to understand himself.

00:32:56.667 --> 00:32:59.083
I would suggest that

00:32:59.291 --> 00:33:02.417
one has to only understand one point,

00:33:02.667 --> 00:33:05.500
that whatever we have so far known

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:09.583
has been the knowledge of the tree.

00:33:09.917 --> 00:33:15.000
But we have to have the knowledge of the roots.

00:33:15.291 --> 00:33:17.750
To get the knowledge of the roots,

00:33:18.041 --> 00:33:21.583
we have to become subtler than what we are.

00:33:21.834 --> 00:33:26.750
This awareness, this human awareness, cannot take us that side.

00:33:26.999 --> 00:33:32.417
For example, you are all listening to Me very intensely,

00:33:32.667 --> 00:33:35.917
but if I say “Please take your attention inside”,

00:33:36.083 --> 00:33:38.083
you’ll say “How? Mother it’s impossible."

00:33:38.333 --> 00:33:41.083
'How do we take our attention inside?”

00:33:41.333 --> 00:33:44.834
It’s only possible when something happens within you

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000
that your attention is drawn inside,

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:51.417
then only you will come to know

00:33:51.625 --> 00:33:57.083
that you are a beautiful instrument made through ages.

00:33:57.417 --> 00:34:02.166
All these centres that are shown here represent

00:34:02.375 --> 00:34:07.000
your evolutionary process, one by one, how you evolved,

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:09.458
through ages

00:34:09.667 --> 00:34:14.667
to this stage of evolution.

00:34:14.875 --> 00:34:20.667
And now after evolving up to the human stage,

00:34:20.917 --> 00:34:23.500
what do we have to do?

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:28.041
So we come to right conclusions about ourselves first of all,

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:31.625
that we have to become something more,

00:34:31.834 --> 00:34:34.834
something has to happen to us.

00:34:35.083 --> 00:34:37.333
Now so far in our evolution

00:34:37.667 --> 00:34:41.834
whatever has happened, has happened in our awareness,

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.250
in Sanskrit called 'cheytana';

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:51.166
means, a horse can go through a dirty lane,

00:34:51.417 --> 00:34:53.750
a dog can go through a dirty lane,

00:34:53.999 --> 00:34:57.166
but a human being cannot, he just can’t bear it.

00:34:57.417 --> 00:34:59.458
He’ll vomit, he’ll refuse,

00:34:59.667 --> 00:35:04.417
he'll not accept at any cost to pass through something very filthy.

00:35:04.709 --> 00:35:10.041
So our awareness towards dirt, filth, towards beauty,

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:14.083
has definitely got a new dimension.

00:35:14.375 --> 00:35:19.125
And this new dimension that we have got is not sufficient enough

00:35:19.333 --> 00:35:23.375
because still we have not understood why are we here,

00:35:23.583 --> 00:35:25.959
why all this has been done

00:35:26.125 --> 00:35:31.333
to create us into such a beautiful personality,

00:35:31.667 --> 00:35:34.667
what is the purpose of this creation.

00:35:34.917 --> 00:35:37.333
And in this confusion only,

00:35:37.583 --> 00:35:43.125
we really fall into the traps of not understanding

00:35:43.333 --> 00:35:46.083
that there must be some power that does it.

00:35:46.333 --> 00:35:49.917
It is very easy to deny the power of God

00:35:50.166 --> 00:35:53.166
because who is there to challenge it?

00:35:53.375 --> 00:35:56.000
Or who is going to say that "How dare you deny?"

00:35:56.250 --> 00:36:00.291
Supposing you have a policeman, he is elected by you,

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:05.125
so you cannot overthrow him, or you have to listen to him.

00:36:05.333 --> 00:36:07.750
But God is not elected by you,

00:36:07.999 --> 00:36:09.999
He is appointed by Himself.

00:36:10.166 --> 00:36:14.999
So as He is there you can always say whatever you like about Him.

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:19.333
But the same thing is to understand

00:36:19.583 --> 00:36:24.667
that actually human beings don't do any work which is living.

00:36:24.875 --> 00:36:29.750
We cannot transform one flower into a fruit.

00:36:29.959 --> 00:36:31.792
Even one.

00:36:31.999 --> 00:36:36.083
What we do is to take some dead things, make buildings,

00:36:36.333 --> 00:36:40.500
make beautiful furniture, make these carpets, all manmade,

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:46.125
every sort of thing, and then we start thinking, “Oh, we are great”.

00:36:46.333 --> 00:36:51.417
Even the science can only find whatever is available

00:36:51.709 --> 00:36:55.750
or can be seen through these eyes or felt through these senses.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.792
It cannot go beyond it, and even if it sometimes goes,

00:36:59.999 --> 00:37:04.083
like the auras and all that they see, they cannot explain it.

00:37:04.333 --> 00:37:08.834
For example if, if there is any doctor they will understand

00:37:09.125 --> 00:37:11.458
that doctors are honest on this point,

00:37:11.667 --> 00:37:15.500
that acetylene and adrenaline,

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:17.999
acetylcholine and adrenaline,

00:37:18.166 --> 00:37:23.166
two chemicals - which are chemicals, just chemicals -

00:37:23.417 --> 00:37:26.667
react differently in the body,

00:37:26.999 --> 00:37:29.999
and they say that the mode of action of these two,

00:37:30.166 --> 00:37:34.834
we cannot explain - why it is augmentation or why it is relaxation.

00:37:35.083 --> 00:37:40.999
They admit it. So many things we have not been able to explain.

00:37:41.333 --> 00:37:45.166
Now, if I say this is a beautiful instrument,

00:37:45.417 --> 00:37:50.250
and it is fantastic to believe that we are great,

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:53.583
I would just give another simple example,

00:37:53.834 --> 00:37:56.999
that if you have to come to this room

00:37:57.208 --> 00:37:59.709
and there is no light, I just tell you,

00:37:59.917 --> 00:38:03.166
"All right, push that button and you will get lights everywhere".

00:38:03.417 --> 00:38:05.500
Now it happens! It becomes a fantastic thing

00:38:05.709 --> 00:38:07.999
for a person who has never seen electricity,

00:38:08.166 --> 00:38:10.875
who has never known anything, who has no knowledge of electricity,

00:38:11.041 --> 00:38:13.667
that only you press one button and you get it.

00:38:13.875 --> 00:38:16.333
But behind all this organism,

00:38:16.542 --> 00:38:19.999
behind all this working, all that is done,

00:38:20.166 --> 00:38:22.417
there is a big history.

00:38:22.625 --> 00:38:26.166
There are lots of people who have worked to achieve this.

00:38:26.417 --> 00:38:29.500
People have sacrificed so much to achieve this,

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:31.917
but we are taking the benefit of that

00:38:32.083 --> 00:38:33.875
as today we are enjoying electricity.

00:38:34.041 --> 00:38:37.667
How many people must have died discovering it?

00:38:38.041 --> 00:38:40.999
How many people must have sacrificed their life

00:38:41.166 --> 00:38:45.500
for discovering the use of it for the masses?

00:38:45.792 --> 00:38:49.500
In the same way we must understand that

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:54.750
maybe that we are something fantastic, reach a conclusion

00:38:54.999 --> 00:38:58.750
that we have to just feel it.

00:38:59.125 --> 00:39:03.250
And unless and until you feel that greatness within you,

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:07.834
you should not just deny that you can achieve it.

00:39:07.999 --> 00:39:09.458
You have to achieve it!

00:39:09.709 --> 00:39:11.750
Actually, if you do not achieve it

00:39:11.999 --> 00:39:15.083
you will fall short of your evolution.

00:39:15.291 --> 00:39:17.333
Today in the world if you see,

00:39:17.542 --> 00:39:21.999
everywhere I go there are so many seekers, so many seekers!

00:39:22.166 --> 00:39:25.417
Such a time was never there before, say about fifty years back

00:39:25.667 --> 00:39:27.834
we did not know the word “seekers”.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000
People did not believe that there are seekers,

00:39:30.208 --> 00:39:33.834
but today you find so many seekers all over the world.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000
They have gone to all kinds of other alternative things,

00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:40.917
they have tried to find out if they can find truth

00:39:41.166 --> 00:39:45.166
by altering their lives, by doing this or by doing that.

00:39:45.417 --> 00:39:49.625
The reason is, they are not at all satisfied with what they see.

00:39:49.834 --> 00:39:53.417
They are intelligent enough to see that it’s not the end

00:39:53.625 --> 00:39:57.834
of our lives and we don’t live just for insurances.

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:01.083
Now, then one starts thinking

00:40:01.333 --> 00:40:03.500
that if these are the seekers in this world,

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:07.166
why so many have come on this earth?

00:40:07.417 --> 00:40:10.250
This is a special time, already predicted

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:12.999
thousands and thousands of years back.

00:40:13.208 --> 00:40:17.834
In every kind of prediction they have talked about it.

00:40:18.166 --> 00:40:20.917
There was a book called 'Nadi Granth', written

00:40:21.083 --> 00:40:23.625
you can’t say how many years back, but was revised

00:40:23.834 --> 00:40:28.083
only three hundred years back by another person called Bhujander.

00:40:28.333 --> 00:40:30.999
Now this Nadi Granth is written by a person

00:40:31.166 --> 00:40:36.417
who is actually the starting point of astrology in India,

00:40:36.667 --> 00:40:40.667
the one who started. The whole astrology has been started from India

00:40:40.917 --> 00:40:43.000
and this is the man, Bhrigu, who did it.

00:40:43.208 --> 00:40:46.917
And he wrote this Nadi Granth in which he has described -

00:40:47.083 --> 00:40:50.291
according to him, he said it in Sanskrit language

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:54.000
but was again translated and brought to up to date level,

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:57.999
that in 1970 something will happen,

00:40:58.166 --> 00:41:01.834
a personality will come on this earth who will

00:41:02.083 --> 00:41:06.583
give realization to thousands of people by a sahaja method.

00:41:06.917 --> 00:41:10.000
It’s clearly written down, you’ll be amazed to know that it is so,

00:41:10.208 --> 00:41:11.667
because we have a book,

00:41:11.875 --> 00:41:14.583
in that book all these prophecies are written.

00:41:14.834 --> 00:41:17.792
And what will happen? The Kundalini will rise

00:41:18.083 --> 00:41:20.166
and people will get their realization.

00:41:20.417 --> 00:41:23.333
To Indians, Kundalini is not a new knowledge.

00:41:23.583 --> 00:41:27.834
Of course, there are some people who went from

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.250
other countries and tried to study about Kundalini.

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:36.375
Now when such people come to India

00:41:36.583 --> 00:41:38.834
they do not reach the roots at all.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.208
They are just caught up by people who want to make money out of them

00:41:42.417 --> 00:41:43.959
or to mislead them.

00:41:44.166 --> 00:41:47.166
It’s a big market there for all such things.

00:41:47.417 --> 00:41:49.458
And now when these people also came,

00:41:49.667 --> 00:41:52.625
specially the Germans, when they came to India,

00:41:52.834 --> 00:41:55.166
they were caught up into such mess

00:41:55.417 --> 00:41:58.083
and they were given books which were nothing but

00:41:58.333 --> 00:42:01.500
just the opposite of what Kundalini is.

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:06.417
It’s about the people who are doing tantrism.

00:42:06.667 --> 00:42:10.917
And tantrism is a system in which people do anti-God activity.

00:42:11.166 --> 00:42:13.792
With anti-God activity you get all kinds of

00:42:14.041 --> 00:42:17.458
horrible experiences of God and the Kundalini,

00:42:17.667 --> 00:42:19.166
and they have described all of them,

00:42:19.375 --> 00:42:23.667
as if they are the real effects of Kundalini.

00:42:23.917 --> 00:42:27.333
It's like the knowledge of a naive villager coming

00:42:27.583 --> 00:42:32.291
and putting his hand into the holes of a plug

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:36.000
and saying that electricity gives you a big shock.

00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:38.125
So, it is even worse than that

00:42:38.333 --> 00:42:40.667
because Kundalini never gives you trouble.

00:42:40.875 --> 00:42:42.625
She is your mother.

00:42:42.834 --> 00:42:45.667
She is settled down here in the triangular bone, as you see,

00:42:45.917 --> 00:42:47.834
is called as 'sacrum'.

00:42:48.083 --> 00:42:53.083
Now this sacrum bone is - sacrum means sacred.

00:42:53.333 --> 00:42:54.999
And when I ask people,

00:42:55.166 --> 00:43:00.834
that how is it that this bone is called as sacred in Greek?

00:43:01.083 --> 00:43:03.166
When I went to Greece I asked the people,

00:43:03.417 --> 00:43:05.291
“Why do you call this a sacrum?”

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:08.750
Then they told Me that they had a report long time back,

00:43:08.999 --> 00:43:12.208
before Alexander went to India,

00:43:12.417 --> 00:43:15.750
and there was a report between Indo-Aryan groups

00:43:15.999 --> 00:43:18.999
and they told that this bone should be called as 'sacrum'.

00:43:19.166 --> 00:43:20.999
Now imagine that this bone specially

00:43:21.166 --> 00:43:23.834
should be called as sacrum and no other bone.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.333
So this bone has got this three and a half coiled energy,

00:43:28.583 --> 00:43:30.500
settled down inside there.

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:33.000
Now, some of these books that I’ve read,

00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:35.083
such big books written on Kundalini -

00:43:35.291 --> 00:43:38.166
some of them say the Kundalini is here, somebody says in the nose,

00:43:38.417 --> 00:43:39.834
somebody says somewhere else -

00:43:40.083 --> 00:43:44.667
means they are just, just using the ignorance of people

00:43:44.917 --> 00:43:48.333
to print something, write something, and just mislead them,

00:43:48.542 --> 00:43:50.333
to make some money out of these books.

00:43:50.583 --> 00:43:52.750
So far I’ve not written any book.

00:43:52.999 --> 00:43:55.750
I am sorry, I’ve not yet done any of that work so far.

00:43:55.999 --> 00:43:58.000
But anything can be written in the book.

00:43:58.208 --> 00:44:00.291
Whatever is written in the book is not the truth

00:44:00.542 --> 00:44:02.041
and you should not accept it.

00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:04.083
How much does it take to print a book?

00:44:04.333 --> 00:44:06.834
You people are living in such an advanced country.

00:44:07.083 --> 00:44:10.250
You know it hardly takes anything to write a book about anything,

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:12.583
especially about God and His work.

00:44:12.834 --> 00:44:16.834
Because even, you'll be amazed that Hitler used to talk about God,

00:44:17.083 --> 00:44:18.959
Napoleon used to talk about God.

00:44:19.125 --> 00:44:21.250
All these horrible people used to talk about God,

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:24.458
and sometimes they believed that God was in their favour

00:44:24.667 --> 00:44:28.166
because they thought they were rather successful.

00:44:28.583 --> 00:44:33.083
Now, these books or whatever they have told you, is not true.

00:44:33.333 --> 00:44:37.999
This is the truth, that the Kundalini lies in your sacred bone,

00:44:38.166 --> 00:44:39.834
called sacrum.

00:44:40.083 --> 00:44:43.625
You can see the pulsation of the Kundalini at the time

00:44:43.834 --> 00:44:47.083
when the Kundalini is raised. Not in everyone,

00:44:47.291 --> 00:44:49.333
if you have got a blockage

00:44:49.583 --> 00:44:51.625
in that another center that is there,

00:44:51.834 --> 00:44:55.250
or the upper, this centre, then this Kundalini - because

00:44:55.500 --> 00:45:00.834
this is the pure desire of becoming one with God.

00:45:01.166 --> 00:45:04.333
This is the purest desire which you have

00:45:04.542 --> 00:45:09.917
and when it is awakened it makes an effort, a tremendous effort.

00:45:10.166 --> 00:45:15.250
But I have seen some people have Kundalinis which are just hurt,

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:21.333
like a beaten up snake, you see, it just tosses.

00:45:21.583 --> 00:45:25.000
It tosses itself on all the sides and tries to get out

00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:28.583
but it cannot because the gentleman or the seeker

00:45:28.834 --> 00:45:31.667
who has got this Kundalini within himself, his own mother,

00:45:31.875 --> 00:45:35.208
has hurt Her so much that She cannot raise her head,

00:45:35.417 --> 00:45:40.999
she is very tired and she wants the supply of pure energy to rise.

00:45:41.333 --> 00:45:46.458
So when people are here I have to tell you one thing, that

00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:50.750
it’s nice that you have come for realization, you should take it.

00:45:51.041 --> 00:45:53.999
But you can’t demand it, you can’t demand it.

00:45:54.166 --> 00:45:57.625
For today I found one gentleman was just shaking before Me like this.

00:45:57.834 --> 00:46:01.417
All the time. So he said, “Why am I shaking before You?”

00:46:01.625 --> 00:46:05.834
I said, “Because your nerves are out. You are a nervous person.

00:46:06.083 --> 00:46:08.250
That’s why you are shaking. All your nerves are out,

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:11.333
I have to steady them, otherwise the Kundalini won’t rise

00:46:11.542 --> 00:46:13.500
and you won’t feel the cool breeze,

00:46:13.709 --> 00:46:17.750
because Kundalini is now attending to those nerve centers

00:46:17.999 --> 00:46:20.999
which are absolutely overdone.

00:46:21.166 --> 00:46:23.458
They are absolutely fagged out and tired."

00:46:23.667 --> 00:46:25.834
He is a young man, about twenty five years,

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000
I am an old woman, but I said, “Look at my hands, are not shaking.

00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:31.417
Why should your hands shake like an old man

00:46:31.667 --> 00:46:33.750
of eighty years all the time? You must think about it."

00:46:33.999 --> 00:46:36.834
Why should they think it should happen?

00:46:37.083 --> 00:46:43.291
So this is what it is, that some people get it.

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:46.750
Most of them get it. But some cannot get it.

00:46:46.999 --> 00:46:49.500
Now the attitude should be little different

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:52.333
from what you have towards anybody else.

00:46:52.583 --> 00:46:56.250
Here you have to get something out of Me.

00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:59.166
You have to make use of Me.

00:46:59.417 --> 00:47:03.417
Not that I have to use you for any purpose whatsoever.

00:47:03.667 --> 00:47:08.250
It should be clear cut that you are asking for something.

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:11.417
You deserve it, no doubt!

00:47:11.667 --> 00:47:13.834
It’s like you go to the bank, all right,

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.667
there’s a banker sitting there.

00:47:15.917 --> 00:47:17.458
If you have some money in the bank,

00:47:17.667 --> 00:47:20.208
you can go and talk to him but you can’t be rude with the banker.

00:47:20.417 --> 00:47:22.917
You have to say, "All right, I have got this money with you,

00:47:23.083 --> 00:47:24.417
please may I have?”

00:47:24.625 --> 00:47:26.999
Now the Grace of God is so gracious,

00:47:27.166 --> 00:47:29.417
that it gives you manifold much more

00:47:29.667 --> 00:47:32.333
than what you have really reserved in the bank.

00:47:32.542 --> 00:47:34.542
I can see that working out so well.

00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:38.999
So we have to understand that we are made in our own glory,

00:47:39.166 --> 00:47:41.750
God has made us a fantastic thing,

00:47:41.999 --> 00:47:46.834
we are a great instrument that has to receive it's blessings.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.083
And as this instrument is put to the mains,

00:47:50.291 --> 00:47:52.041
once you put to your mains,

00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:56.166
you will be surprised how fantastic you are.

00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:00.500
It’s amazing how people are not aware of themselves.

00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:03.375
It is amazing how people do not know,

00:48:03.583 --> 00:48:05.834
how precious they are to the Divine.

00:48:06.083 --> 00:48:10.083
Human beings are the epitome of this creation.

00:48:10.333 --> 00:48:13.667
Forget the moon, forget the sun, forget this earth,

00:48:13.917 --> 00:48:16.834
everything is nothing, it’s at your feet.

00:48:17.083 --> 00:48:19.500
You are the highest that God has created

00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:22.417
and the way we fritter away our life for nothing at all,

00:48:22.667 --> 00:48:26.333
for superficial things, is something very, very surprising.

00:48:26.583 --> 00:48:31.166
We are not at all aware that how much the nature has worked for us,

00:48:31.375 --> 00:48:32.999
to make us human beings.

00:48:33.166 --> 00:48:36.834
And once you realize that you are the Spirit -

00:48:37.083 --> 00:48:38.333
realize doesn’t mean

00:48:38.542 --> 00:48:41.834
that you just realize it through a mental process,

00:48:42.083 --> 00:48:46.417
it is a happening within you, which takes place. You become that!

00:48:46.667 --> 00:48:50.458
And once you become that, you’ll be amazed

00:48:50.667 --> 00:48:55.834
that your becoming will prove that you are really the epitome,

00:48:56.041 --> 00:48:58.999
you are the meaning, you are everything

00:48:59.166 --> 00:49:03.083
and without you, the creation has no meaning at all.

00:49:03.417 --> 00:49:06.999
It’s like a tree which has now the flowers,

00:49:07.166 --> 00:49:08.917
and they have to become the fruits,

00:49:09.083 --> 00:49:11.583
otherwise the tree has no meaning at all.

00:49:11.917 --> 00:49:17.333
But whatever we do mentally is artificial.

00:49:17.667 --> 00:49:21.999
Because it has no roots attached to it,

00:49:22.166 --> 00:49:24.333
it has no moorings to it.

00:49:24.625 --> 00:49:29.417
Now your, say your politics or your economics, all is artificial.

00:49:29.709 --> 00:49:32.583
But in that also you can find a lot of truth.

00:49:32.875 --> 00:49:37.417
For example, economics says that wants in general are not satiable.

00:49:37.667 --> 00:49:39.709
Individual wants can be satisfied,

00:49:39.917 --> 00:49:41.959
but wants in general are not satiable,

00:49:42.125 --> 00:49:46.250
means this matter cannot give us satisfaction.

00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:49.375
If it could then we would have been satisfied with one thing,

00:49:49.583 --> 00:49:52.333
but we buy one thing, then we buy, want to buy another thing

00:49:52.583 --> 00:49:54.999
and then we want to buy another thing and still we are

00:49:55.166 --> 00:49:59.999
the most dissatisfied souls ever living on this earth.

00:50:00.166 --> 00:50:04.709
Now economics another, then politics we can see,

00:50:04.917 --> 00:50:09.834
is that people talk of say, communism, they talk of socialism,

00:50:10.083 --> 00:50:13.333
they talk of democracy, of capitalism.

00:50:13.583 --> 00:50:17.417
It's also artificial to Me, it's just a play of human beings.

00:50:17.667 --> 00:50:23.083
Because when you say you are a capitalist - what is your capital?

00:50:23.333 --> 00:50:25.834
This you can’t take with you. It's of no use.

00:50:26.083 --> 00:50:28.417
You don’t want to share it. What's the use of such a capital?

00:50:28.625 --> 00:50:30.625
While I would say I am a capitalist

00:50:30.834 --> 00:50:32.999
because I have all the powers within Myself.

00:50:33.250 --> 00:50:34.625
And I am the greatest communist

00:50:34.834 --> 00:50:38.083
because I can't live without sharing it. I just can’t help it.

00:50:38.333 --> 00:50:39.709
You see, people can’t understand Me.

00:50:39.917 --> 00:50:41.834
They think, "You are a nicely married lady,

00:50:42.083 --> 00:50:45.667
your husband is such a nice person, is such a nice gentleman,

00:50:45.875 --> 00:50:48.041
he loves you so much, he cares for you so much.

00:50:48.250 --> 00:50:51.375
You are a grandmother,you are a mother and why are You doing all this

00:50:51.583 --> 00:50:53.750
and running about everywhere, talking to people?

00:50:53.999 --> 00:50:57.917
They can’t understand this communism which is so important to Me

00:50:58.083 --> 00:51:01.834
that I cannot get My joy without sharing it with others.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.333
It's something which people have to gradually take in

00:51:06.583 --> 00:51:08.834
and once they take in, they become themselves.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.750
It’s my job that I have to give you what you have.

00:51:12.999 --> 00:51:16.083
It’s your own. I do not do anything about it,

00:51:16.333 --> 00:51:18.417
it's your own. All you are built in that way.

00:51:18.667 --> 00:51:22.166
Only thing what I do, like a candle which is enlightened

00:51:22.417 --> 00:51:25.750
can enlighten any other candle, which is ready.

00:51:26.041 --> 00:51:28.333
But some people will escape saying, “I’m not ready”.

00:51:28.542 --> 00:51:30.999
Now, you let Me find out if you are ready or not.

00:51:31.166 --> 00:51:32.375
That’s another side of it.

00:51:32.583 --> 00:51:35.166
“Mother, we are sinners, we are not ready.”

00:51:35.417 --> 00:51:37.291
Now you let Me do the job for you.

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:39.208
I may be able to put the candle right.

00:51:39.417 --> 00:51:42.834
Why do you condemn yourself? This is the other side of it.

00:51:43.083 --> 00:51:45.000
Sometimes people get into ego moods

00:51:45.250 --> 00:51:47.500
and sometimes they get into such a superego mood

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:50.834
that they say,” Mother, oh we are no good, we are sinners,

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.583
we have done this, we have done that.” Now forget it!

00:51:53.834 --> 00:51:56.999
If I don’t know the job then I better not do it.

00:51:57.166 --> 00:51:59.041
But I think I know it, I have done it.

00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:03.083
So let Me do it, and let us see if I can give what you have.

00:52:03.333 --> 00:52:06.917
Because that is supposed to be God’s promise, that

00:52:07.083 --> 00:52:09.458
you have to get your resurrection,

00:52:09.667 --> 00:52:13.333
that you have to become self-realized, that you are to be born again

00:52:13.583 --> 00:52:16.291
and all this has been done within you with this aim

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:17.875
and is not to be wasted.

00:52:18.041 --> 00:52:20.750
I don’t know how many in Melbourne are going to get it.

00:52:20.959 --> 00:52:24.083
How many are going to get it in Sydney, that’s besides the point.

00:52:24.333 --> 00:52:27.417
It depends on how much you care for yourself.

00:52:27.667 --> 00:52:31.834
But wherever I go I will try my level best to do it.

00:52:32.041 --> 00:52:35.125
Now, how I cure people and what happens -

00:52:35.333 --> 00:52:38.291
actually curing is not at all My job,

00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:41.375
it's just a by-product by which you get cured completely.

00:52:41.583 --> 00:52:46.375
Because once you get your absolute and you get to the source

00:52:46.583 --> 00:52:50.834
which is all pervading, which starts flowing through you,

00:52:51.083 --> 00:52:53.166
then your problem is solved.

00:52:53.417 --> 00:52:56.000
You never get exhausted, you never get upset.

00:52:56.250 --> 00:52:59.041
It’s all solved. The whole energy works it out.

00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:01.333
So the compassion that people talk of

00:53:01.583 --> 00:53:03.041
that we are very compassionate

00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:06.583
and we are very peace loving and all that, is so superficial.

00:53:06.834 --> 00:53:08.999
This is the compassion that it works.

00:53:09.166 --> 00:53:12.333
It works, it doesn’t talk, it just works.

00:53:12.583 --> 00:53:14.667
This is the peace that exists,

00:53:14.917 --> 00:53:18.417
that you feel is expressed within you and without.

00:53:18.667 --> 00:53:20.083
A person of that calibre

00:53:20.291 --> 00:53:23.333
if he stays with other people who are turbulent,

00:53:23.542 --> 00:53:27.000
who are volcanic, who are violent,

00:53:27.250 --> 00:53:31.750
they become peaceful. It works.  That’s what it is.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:37.500
You must know that whatever people are saying to you, it must work.

00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:40.834
Like going to other gurus, to other people,

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:44.917
you should know that it has not given you any power of your own.

00:53:45.083 --> 00:53:47.083
Leave alone whatever they have to say about Me,

00:53:47.333 --> 00:53:49.333
I am this, I am that, I am that. Forget it.

00:53:49.583 --> 00:53:53.250
What I am saying, what are you?

00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:56.750
You have to receive your own significance.

00:53:56.999 --> 00:53:59.583
You have to understand your own meaning

00:53:59.792 --> 00:54:02.375
and if it works in you then it’s all right.

00:54:02.583 --> 00:54:06.834
That’s what you should ask anyone if you go to and say that

00:54:07.083 --> 00:54:10.500
“Can you give me my own powers, not your powers?”

00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:13.166
You may be very great and you might be doing something.

00:54:13.417 --> 00:54:15.917
But people are so ridiculously superficial,

00:54:16.083 --> 00:54:19.667
so ridiculously superficial that a person if he buys

00:54:19.917 --> 00:54:23.625
fifty-eight Rolls Royce out of the money of loots that they have,

00:54:23.834 --> 00:54:26.625
out of these people who go to them,

00:54:26.834 --> 00:54:29.333
we think “Oh, he has fifty-eight Rolls Royce.”

00:54:29.583 --> 00:54:32.583
He, such a man can impress these English

00:54:32.834 --> 00:54:34.875
who could not be impressed by anything else,

00:54:35.041 --> 00:54:38.375
if he has a big cavalcade or a big procession

00:54:38.583 --> 00:54:43.750
of these fifty-eight looted Rolls Royce on the road,

00:54:43.999 --> 00:54:45.917
then people say, “Oh! what a guru he is,

00:54:46.083 --> 00:54:48.667
he’s got fifty-eight Rolls Royce.”

00:54:48.959 --> 00:54:52.750
Yes, you won’t believe, and he wanted to have the fifty-ninth one.

00:54:52.999 --> 00:54:54.291
And he went away to America.

00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:55.625
And he wrote a letter saying that

00:54:55.834 --> 00:54:57.417
"If you give me the fifty-ninth I’ll come".

00:54:57.667 --> 00:54:59.959
The poor boys, you see,

00:55:00.125 --> 00:55:04.000
they suffered, they ate only potatoes, they starved themselves.

00:55:04.250 --> 00:55:06.917
They have - they are fifty thousand still in U.K.,

00:55:07.083 --> 00:55:10.291
absolutely cabbages, lost people, absolutely lost.

00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:13.041
You can’t talk to them. They shake when you go before them.

00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:15.667
They can’t understand, it is all finished there,

00:55:15.875 --> 00:55:17.999
nothing, they are all lost people.

00:55:18.250 --> 00:55:20.667
And if you go and tell them “How can you

00:55:20.959 --> 00:55:24.583
get a Rolls Royce for a sadhu? He's a sanyasi, he says.

00:55:24.792 --> 00:55:26.792
How can you give him a Rolls Royce?”

00:55:26.999 --> 00:55:30.458
So they say, “We have got the Spirit”,

00:55:30.667 --> 00:55:33.166
means some spirit has possessed them, you see,

00:55:33.417 --> 00:55:37.000
“We have got the Spirit and we have to give just metal.

00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:38.834
What is in Rolls Royce? Is metal."

00:55:38.999 --> 00:55:42.250
But why don’t they think, why does the guru

00:55:42.458 --> 00:55:44.250
think that this metal is precious?

00:55:44.458 --> 00:55:47.542
You see, we don’t use our brains at all when you go to gurus,

00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:50.625
surprisingly. If he says, "I will make you fly".

00:55:50.834 --> 00:55:54.250
All right, at least you should ask the guru to fly.

00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:56.542
Why not make him fly and see if he can fly or not.

00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:59.333
At least minimum of minimum that he should do, isn’t it?

00:55:59.583 --> 00:56:01.959
But that also we never do, we just accept it.

00:56:02.125 --> 00:56:06.417
Because he has a big organisation and he has a big publicity,

00:56:06.667 --> 00:56:09.959
because you can pass through seven rooms to reach him and all that.

00:56:10.125 --> 00:56:13.417
He creates a feeling, and then you think “Oh, it’s great to fly”.

00:56:13.667 --> 00:56:17.500
And if somebody says that, "Go and ask that guru to fly",

00:56:17.709 --> 00:56:21.542
people don’t like it. They don’t want to hear anything about it.

00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:25.250
And then you pay thousands and thousands of pounds to them.

00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:29.083
You end up as penniless people, as epileptic people,

00:56:29.333 --> 00:56:31.667
and you can’t understand what wrong it was.

00:56:31.917 --> 00:56:34.667
You didn’t use your brains!

00:56:34.917 --> 00:56:36.999
You didn’t use your brains I would say.

00:56:37.166 --> 00:56:39.500
I know, I must condemn all these devilish people

00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:42.667
who have ruined so many seekers because they are seeking truth.

00:56:42.999 --> 00:56:45.542
They are my children, they’re my own, I know.

00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:49.917
I feel very sorry for them. You don’t know how much I want to work,

00:56:50.083 --> 00:56:52.667
that I should save all of them, but

00:56:52.875 --> 00:56:57.333
I also should tell you that this is your mistake, you misunderstand.

00:56:57.583 --> 00:57:00.333
You don’t know that you can’t pay for your realization,

00:57:00.583 --> 00:57:04.417
you can’t pay for God.

00:57:04.667 --> 00:57:07.083
Christ was bought for 30 rupees.

00:57:07.333 --> 00:57:10.083
It's a very good example to understand.

00:57:10.333 --> 00:57:13.999
He was bought to be killed.

00:57:14.166 --> 00:57:17.667
Another example is that when people were selling some things

00:57:17.875 --> 00:57:22.500
in the temple, He took a big whip and whipped them,

00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:26.458
absolutely in a great temper. Who said on the cross, that

00:57:26.667 --> 00:57:30.166
“Please God forgive them for they do not know what they are doing.”

00:57:30.417 --> 00:57:35.999
But now it is so sad that if you do like that

00:57:36.250 --> 00:57:38.333
you won’t be able to forgive yourself.

00:57:38.583 --> 00:57:41.333
Christ maybe, but you may not be able to forgive yourself

00:57:41.583 --> 00:57:47.000
for doing all these mistakes and committing such horrible injuries

00:57:47.250 --> 00:57:51.500
upon yourself and troubling your Kundalini to that extent.

00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:57.583
This Self-realization you have been seeking for ages, many lives.

00:57:57.834 --> 00:58:01.041
You have been seekers for many lives and the time has come,

00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:05.999
this great time of resurrection, the great time of your judgement.

00:58:06.166 --> 00:58:09.667
At this time you should take it, take it up

00:58:09.875 --> 00:58:13.917
that you have to be self-realized! Only this is my message to you.

00:58:14.083 --> 00:58:19.166
I hope you will understand it. May God bless you.

00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:21.834
I would like you to ask Me some questions

00:58:22.083 --> 00:58:25.208
because today is the first day. But ask relevant questions.

00:58:25.417 --> 00:58:29.041
Some people, you see, just ask questions just to show off.

00:58:29.250 --> 00:58:31.458
Then I would say they should take another hall

00:58:31.667 --> 00:58:36.166
to give a lecture there. But normally -

00:58:36.417 --> 00:58:39.041
yes, some people start giving another lecture to Me, you see,

00:58:39.250 --> 00:58:41.500
and instead of My lecture, I have to listen to their lecture,

00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:43.542
which has no relevance to it, you see.

00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:48.291
So I would request you not to waste others’ time. Be civil to them,

00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:52.250
and ask questions which are relevant to the subject.

00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:55.166
Thank you very much.

00:59:08.417 --> 00:59:11.083
Right. Any questions?

00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:13.750
Each night Mataji is going to be speaking here.

00:59:13.999 --> 00:59:17.667
Keep the cane on one side.

00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:22.750
Each night Mataji is going to be speaking here.

00:59:22.999 --> 00:59:25.542
She’ll be talking tomorrow night about

00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:29.333
the centers that lie up to the heart,

00:59:29.542 --> 00:59:32.999
and the next night the centers that lie to the Sahasrara,

00:59:33.166 --> 00:59:36.917
in particular the chakra of the Sahasrara.

00:59:37.083 --> 00:59:42.333
So, any particular questions about the individual centers within us,

00:59:42.583 --> 00:59:46.583
We can ask tomorrow.
she’ll be explaining on a day-by-day basis.

00:59:46.834 --> 00:59:50.000
So any questions thus far?

00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:54.999
I'd like to know if having a vertebrae in the spine out of place

00:59:55.458 --> 00:59:58.750
interferes with the rising of the Kundalini?

00:59:58.959 --> 01:00:01.208
Does having a vertebrae out of place in the spine

01:00:01.458 --> 01:00:03.583
interfere with the rising of Kundalini?

01:00:03.792 --> 01:00:06.000
It does to some extent, it does.

01:00:06.250 --> 01:00:08.250
Definitely it does, but we can put it right.

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:11.250
The vertebrae can be put right and the Kundalini can be brought in.

01:00:11.458 --> 01:00:14.166
It does. So many things do happen, if you have -

01:00:14.417 --> 01:00:16.375
you are a person over read;

01:00:16.583 --> 01:00:18.999
if you have read too many books and the books are in your head,

01:00:19.166 --> 01:00:22.250
I have to empty that also.

01:00:25.208 --> 01:00:29.333
I actually do this work as a profession and I find that

01:00:29.583 --> 01:00:34.750
if the subtle center is fixed, the spinal problems just disappear.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000
I used to have three and four adjustments a week,

01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:41.333
to correct my spine and now I have none at all.

01:00:41.583 --> 01:00:45.834
So first fix the subtle within us and then the gross part,

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.166
the spinal misalignments and so on, will just get better.

01:00:54.166 --> 01:00:56.250
Any others?

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.041
May I ask another question?
Yes.

01:01:07.667 --> 01:01:12.999
Do you feel that there can be a difference between, in marriage,

01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:18.667
that people can be married on earth, in a seemingly holiness,

01:01:19.333 --> 01:01:22.500
that there is really a difference in a marriage of souls,

01:01:22.834 --> 01:01:27.250
than there is in many marriages, so-called marriages.

01:01:28.375 --> 01:01:30.166
[...]

01:01:30.417 --> 01:01:36.250
I’m not too sure, but, earthly marriages which seem to be ok,

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:39.834
but - did you saying a mismarriage of souls?

01:01:40.083 --> 01:01:43.583
Perhaps, but maybe there is some sort of

01:01:43.834 --> 01:01:47.500
mismarriage in some way of souls of those same people.

01:01:47.834 --> 01:01:51.667
Can there be a perfectly “normal” - as we call it, earthly marriage,

01:01:51.999 --> 01:01:58.166
and perhaps a mismarriage of souls, in a heavenly sense?

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:02.750
You see the Spirit in every being is perfect.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Everybody’s Spirit is perfect. There’s no imperfection with it.

01:02:07.291 --> 01:02:11.750
But some people have a more reflection of the Spirit

01:02:11.999 --> 01:02:15.166
in their character, and some people don’t have.

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:23.333
They have more darkness and more we can say,

01:02:23.709 --> 01:02:26.834
outward look or materialistic you can call them,

01:02:27.083 --> 01:02:29.834
or you can call them, they are over-romantic type,

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.917
any sort of thing which is outside. But doesn’t matter.

01:02:34.083 --> 01:02:37.291
We have seen people who have been married before,

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:39.333
they said they are mal-adjusted.

01:02:39.625 --> 01:02:44.417
I would say ninety percent such marriages are now doing well.

01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:47.750
But maybe, there could be terrible difference also

01:02:47.999 --> 01:02:50.750
between the two persons, as you say. It's possible.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.834
But that is to be seen. Just now you should not worry about it.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.250
If there is any mal-adjustment, it might be put right.

01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:00.083
If it doesn’t work out

01:03:00.291 --> 01:03:04.583
then you have to work out the correction as far as possible.

01:03:04.875 --> 01:03:07.166
See it is said 'Karmanye vadhikaraste',

01:03:07.417 --> 01:03:09.875
is that with which we can do the work.

01:03:10.166 --> 01:03:12.583
We can work it out as far as possible.

01:03:12.834 --> 01:03:16.417
But if it doesn’t work, forget it. That’s it.

01:03:16.625 --> 01:03:19.417
But once you are a realised soul,

01:03:19.625 --> 01:03:24.083
you become so congenial, so tolerant, so understanding.

01:03:24.333 --> 01:03:28.000
Actually your being itself corrects the other person.

01:03:28.291 --> 01:03:31.583
But maybe some people can be such gone cases,

01:03:31.834 --> 01:03:34.834
that whatever you may try they may not come back.

01:03:35.083 --> 01:03:37.917
So it's not important to worry about those things.

01:03:38.166 --> 01:03:40.250
We’ll see later on how the thing is

01:03:40.458 --> 01:03:44.166
and how it has to be worked out, all right?

01:03:44.999 --> 01:03:49.083
Could You please explain more about the realization process

01:03:49.333 --> 01:03:51.583
when it comes out of the top of your head.

01:03:51.875 --> 01:03:54.917
Could You explain Self-realization, and in particular

01:03:55.083 --> 01:03:56.750
how it manifests on your hands

01:03:56.999 --> 01:03:59.917
and how it comes out of the top of your head.

01:04:00.166 --> 01:04:02.917
It just comes out.

01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:07.125
You see, how will you explain

01:04:07.333 --> 01:04:11.333
how does a primule or the germ of a seed comes out?

01:04:11.583 --> 01:04:14.041
It’s like that, it’s a living process as I said.

01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:18.333
The Kundalini rises and when She enlightens all other centers

01:04:18.583 --> 01:04:21.750
She passes through them and then when She comes up here,

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.750
at this point, this point is very important in human beings,

01:04:25.999 --> 01:04:29.625
is bestowed or, we can say the -

01:04:29.875 --> 01:04:34.041
it is governed by the deity of Lord Jesus Christ.

01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:39.083
And He sucks in these two institutions called ego and super-ego.

01:04:39.333 --> 01:04:42.834
By that there’s an opening made and the Kundalini just

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.166
jets out and you can feel it coming out of your head.

01:04:46.375 --> 01:04:50.667
This is the actualisation of baptism. It’s not something artificial,

01:04:50.917 --> 01:04:54.709
that you take water and put it on somebody’s head and say that

01:04:54.917 --> 01:05:00.917
"you are baptised" and hear the child is screaming with that baptism.

01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:07.417
So it’s an actualisation, it’s a living process, how it works.

01:05:07.834 --> 01:05:13.500
But while rising of course lots of things happen, like the

01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:18.750
chakras go into various moods, they try to sustain the Kundalini,

01:05:18.999 --> 01:05:22.417
they try to keep it there. All these things happen.

01:05:22.709 --> 01:05:28.166
These happen when the Kundalini is awakened, not before that.

01:05:28.583 --> 01:05:31.500
That’s why, like somebody talks of Raja Yoga,

01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:35.208
that you cut your tongue, push it back and do the 'kechari'

01:05:35.417 --> 01:05:39.333
and by that you can raise your Kundalini. And it is absurd, you see.

01:05:39.583 --> 01:05:41.375
Like the car has not started,

01:05:41.583 --> 01:05:44.500
so you move the wheels and the car will start.

01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:46.375
But when the Kundalini is rising,

01:05:46.583 --> 01:05:49.166
this tongue is little bit pulled inside no doubt,

01:05:49.375 --> 01:05:50.917
automatically. You don’t feel it also.

01:05:51.083 --> 01:05:53.583
Slightly it is pulled inside and is released again.

01:05:53.834 --> 01:05:56.041
But by cutting this tongue and putting it back

01:05:56.250 --> 01:05:57.583
do you think the Kundalini will rise?

01:05:57.834 --> 01:06:00.083
It's so superficial, it’s so artificial.

01:06:00.291 --> 01:06:02.083
And that’s how they have done all these things.

01:06:02.291 --> 01:06:05.125
Even now, for example Hatha Yoga that we do,

01:06:05.333 --> 01:06:07.208
is -of course Hatha Yoga is ashtanga,

01:06:07.417 --> 01:06:10.834
it is not only one that we call as yoga, is standing on your head,

01:06:10.999 --> 01:06:12.999
It's not the only thing. It is ashtanga.

01:06:13.166 --> 01:06:15.500
There are eight things and in that also, 'Ishvara pranidhana',

01:06:15.709 --> 01:06:19.000
means the establishment of God, is the first thing.

01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:21.625
Because before the Kundalini has started

01:06:21.834 --> 01:06:25.500
if you start doing any exercises, you may be harming yourself.

01:06:25.709 --> 01:06:27.625
Because you don’t know where is the problem.

01:06:27.834 --> 01:06:29.291
Supposing you have a problem in the stomach

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:32.500
and you are doing the exercises of the nose, what’s the use?

01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:36.417
You will spoil the nose as well as the stomach is already bad.

01:06:36.667 --> 01:06:38.834
So it's very indiscriminate. It’s very scientific.

01:06:39.083 --> 01:06:41.999
The mantras are the same thing. Where to say which mantras,

01:06:42.166 --> 01:06:45.834
what chakras are catching, which deity is to be awakened,

01:06:46.083 --> 01:06:47.999
we must know all the science behind it.

01:06:48.166 --> 01:06:50.999
And everybody knows, there is no secret about it.

01:06:51.166 --> 01:06:53.041
There is not the thing you come here inside,

01:06:53.250 --> 01:06:56.125
and you will pay Me three hundred pounds and I'll give you a mantra.

01:06:56.333 --> 01:06:58.667
All right, that mantra you are not to tell anybody,

01:06:58.999 --> 01:07:00.834
because that mantra means nothing, you see.

01:07:01.041 --> 01:07:03.208
There was a fellow who paid three hundred pounds,

01:07:03.417 --> 01:07:05.542
and I asked him what was the mantra. He said “tinga”.

01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:07.750
Now if you tell an Indian he will just laugh,

01:07:07.999 --> 01:07:10.792
if he hears what it means, it means this.

01:07:11.041 --> 01:07:13.083
Can you imagine such nonsense?

01:07:13.291 --> 01:07:15.834
And don’t tell anybody! It’s a big Mafia.

01:07:16.083 --> 01:07:18.250
Don’t tell anybody, just keep quiet.

01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:22.917
If you tell anybody, then - because you have found out.

01:07:24.583 --> 01:07:28.999
So you cannot give one mantra. Is another funny idea people have

01:07:29.166 --> 01:07:31.750
that you just give one mantra to somebody.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.917
Of course, I mean if you have a problem at a particular point

01:07:35.083 --> 01:07:39.500
one can say that, "At this time you say this mantra to clear out".

01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:42.083
But then later on you don’t go on with it.

01:07:42.333 --> 01:07:46.417
Then you do the one which where you need, require. Isn’t it?

01:07:46.667 --> 01:07:49.834
I'ts simple as that. Supposing you are suffering from some trouble,

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.083
we take medicine for that particular thing.

01:07:52.333 --> 01:07:54.542
And then, when we are suffering from another trouble

01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:57.750
we take another medicine for that particular thing.

01:07:57.999 --> 01:08:01.667
We don’t go on taking the same medicine, whether it is anything.

01:08:01.999 --> 01:08:03.834
So it is a very scientific knowledge,

01:08:04.083 --> 01:08:05.583
which you will pick up in no time.

01:08:05.834 --> 01:08:10.792
Eight days are sufficient to learn the whole of Sahaja Yoga.

01:08:11.125 --> 01:08:14.250
Once you get your realisation, that’s the main point is.

01:08:14.583 --> 01:08:18.999
Excuse me. Does meat eating interfere with all this?

01:08:19.959 --> 01:08:21.166
What is it?

01:08:21.458 --> 01:08:23.999
Does meat eating interfere with this process?

01:08:24.166 --> 01:08:28.250
No, not at all, not at all. But you see, you have to understand,

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:30.834
what sort of a personality you are.

01:08:31.083 --> 01:08:34.333
If you are the right sided personality then you should not eat meat,

01:08:34.583 --> 01:08:37.000
you should take to something milder,

01:08:37.250 --> 01:08:40.041
you can, I call them grass eating, you can do.

01:08:40.250 --> 01:08:43.999
But if you have say, you are a left sided person,

01:08:44.166 --> 01:08:45.709
then you have to take meat.

01:08:45.917 --> 01:08:47.750
You see, I would say in general that

01:08:47.999 --> 01:08:50.333
Australians should not eat so much meat as they eat.

01:08:50.542 --> 01:08:54.333
They eat meat too much.They should take more vegetables.

01:08:54.583 --> 01:08:56.208
But Indians should eat some meat

01:08:56.417 --> 01:08:58.834
because otherwise they’ll become cowards.

01:08:59.083 --> 01:09:01.250
So it is what sort of a personality it is.

01:09:01.458 --> 01:09:03.417
I don’t know from where this idea has come,

01:09:03.625 --> 01:09:05.917
that vegetarianism is going to take to God.

01:09:06.083 --> 01:09:07.999
In India most of the people are vegetarians

01:09:08.166 --> 01:09:09.999
because they can’t afford it, you see.

01:09:10.166 --> 01:09:13.999
No, no, no, I don't care about that vegetarianism to take to God...

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:18.166
Now, yes, but it is not important for everyone. What I’m saying,

01:09:18.417 --> 01:09:21.333
as it is, we have to understand, we have to be discreet,

01:09:21.583 --> 01:09:24.000
we have to understand who needs what.

01:09:24.250 --> 01:09:26.417
Everybody need not take vegetarian food.

01:09:26.667 --> 01:09:29.000
Everybody need not take non-vegetarian food.

01:09:29.250 --> 01:09:31.917
It’s the 'prakriti' they call it, nature of a person.

01:09:32.083 --> 01:09:35.041
You must find out what is the nature of the person is.

01:09:35.250 --> 01:09:38.208
If he, supposing he is suffering from high blood pressure,

01:09:38.417 --> 01:09:43.583
and other things like that, he has to take to food which is,

01:09:43.792 --> 01:09:48.125
which will control his, I mean which will give him another side;

01:09:48.333 --> 01:09:50.834
means he should stop eating meats and things like that.

01:09:51.083 --> 01:09:53.999
All right? So he, he balances himself, to balance himself.

01:09:54.250 --> 01:09:58.125
The whole food theory is to be understood through

01:09:58.458 --> 01:10:01.375
the understanding of your being first of all,

01:10:01.583 --> 01:10:02.959
what sort of a being you are,

01:10:03.125 --> 01:10:05.792
and what is lacking in you is to be supplemented.

01:10:05.999 --> 01:10:08.000
So we just can’t say that,

01:10:08.250 --> 01:10:10.667
now so many people now, and doctors if you go to them they’ll say,

01:10:10.917 --> 01:10:14.000
“Cut down your sugar”, general. But it's absurd.

01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:16.458
Sugar is very important for liver.

01:10:16.667 --> 01:10:19.000
If you don’t take sugar I don’t know what will happen to you,

01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:21.834
you will become like sticks, you see, absolutely like sticks.

01:10:22.083 --> 01:10:25.375
If those people who are right-sided,if they don’t take sugar at all,

01:10:25.583 --> 01:10:26.917
I don’t know what’s going to happen to them.

01:10:27.083 --> 01:10:29.375
They'll be very irritable, hot-tempered,

01:10:29.583 --> 01:10:33.083
absolutely stick-like people.They’ll hit you like a stick, you know.

01:10:33.333 --> 01:10:35.999
So that’s something, a general statement like that,

01:10:36.166 --> 01:10:38.083
is very dangerous, just not to have.

01:10:38.333 --> 01:10:40.291
But what is the science behind it?

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:42.750
Carbohydrates are very important for the body,

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
especially if you are thinking too much,

01:10:45.250 --> 01:10:47.999
if you are a futuristic person, if you are right sided,

01:10:48.166 --> 01:10:52.083
it’s absolutely essential that you must have sufficient carbohydrates.

01:10:52.333 --> 01:10:54.999
We have treated so many liver patients with sugar.

01:10:55.166 --> 01:10:57.834
So this kind of a general statement even - sorry for,

01:10:58.083 --> 01:11:00.500
I must say that doctors should not feel hurt,

01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:03.083
but is a very general statement doctors also make.

01:11:03.333 --> 01:11:05.999
No doubt about it, without going into it to find it,

01:11:06.166 --> 01:11:11.250
it’s very easy to say, “Now you all should stop sugars.” Why?

01:11:11.999 --> 01:11:15.083
Our forefathers ate sugars. They were healthier people than us,

01:11:15.291 --> 01:11:17.917
I tell you. All of us are sick now, this way or the other.

01:11:18.083 --> 01:11:20.458
If physically you are all right, mentally we are out.

01:11:20.667 --> 01:11:22.458
If we are mentally out,

01:11:22.667 --> 01:11:25.083
then we think that physically we are all right.

01:11:25.291 --> 01:11:30.000
So we have a satisfaction but I think both are just the same.

01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:33.583
So we have to be discreet in anything that we do.

01:11:33.834 --> 01:11:36.625
It cannot be a fad, it cannot be an -ism,

01:11:36.834 --> 01:11:39.458
it cannot be a hard and fast line.

01:11:39.667 --> 01:11:42.333
It's all made for you. God has made everything for you.

01:11:42.542 --> 01:11:46.750
You must understand what we should eat, what will suit us.

01:11:47.041 --> 01:11:49.291
That is to be found out on a person,

01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:51.500
what sort of a personality he is.

01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:55.250
In our Sahaja Yoga many people take to vegetables,

01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:58.542
and many people have to take to meat eating.

01:11:58.750 --> 01:12:01.208
And by that they have improved their health very much.

01:12:01.417 --> 01:12:03.750
He is one who was suffering from high blood pressure,

01:12:03.999 --> 01:12:06.959
God knows how many things. He just dropped it like that.

01:12:07.125 --> 01:12:12.500
And he keeps low on meats I think.

01:12:14.999 --> 01:12:21.583
Do You find that today many people are more sicker, not to think of

01:12:21.834 --> 01:12:27.250
they look older, seeking the health than fifty years ago and...

01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:31.625
Do you find that more people today are sicker,

01:12:31.834 --> 01:12:35.999
in general, than they were fifty years ago?

01:12:36.333 --> 01:12:37.500
No doubt.

01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:38.750
Why?

01:12:39.041 --> 01:12:40.999
Because a time has come, to see.

01:12:41.166 --> 01:12:43.999
This is the time you are born for this.

01:12:44.250 --> 01:12:47.208
Many children are born realised these days, so many children.

01:12:47.417 --> 01:12:51.458
Now we have in our ashram about nine children, very beautiful ones,

01:12:51.667 --> 01:12:54.417
all born realised, absolutely they are.

01:12:54.667 --> 01:12:57.000
You can talk to them better than you can talk to,

01:12:57.250 --> 01:12:59.333
even a very well educated person.

01:12:59.583 --> 01:13:02.458
When I talk to them I just find I am just one with them.

01:13:02.667 --> 01:13:05.083
So this is the time, the resurrection time,

01:13:05.333 --> 01:13:08.500
this is the time that is the Last Judgement, and that’s why

01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:11.625
so many have taken birth for their judgement, all right?

01:13:11.834 --> 01:13:13.834
No I didn't ask this kind of seeking.

01:13:14.083 --> 01:13:16.667
I asked seeking the health, malaj.

01:13:16.917 --> 01:13:19.166
Physically sickening.

01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:23.375
She’s asking whether more people are sicker today

01:13:23.583 --> 01:13:26.458
than they were fifty years ago. But I fear if the question is obvious.

01:13:26.667 --> 01:13:29.375
so I think medical science and statistics have proven this,

01:13:29.583 --> 01:13:32.000
so I don’t think there’s any question there.

01:13:32.250 --> 01:13:33.250
No, no, but what’s she saying physically?

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:35.999
You want to know why, she wants to know why

01:13:36.166 --> 01:13:38.250
Because you think they are physically sick, is it?

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:42.542
Your judgement, no. You see they are physically sick

01:13:42.792 --> 01:13:47.083
because they have lost their roots.

01:13:47.417 --> 01:13:51.333
They have gone to extremes and imbalances.

01:13:51.709 --> 01:13:53.583
We cannot go to imbalance, you see.

01:13:53.834 --> 01:13:56.625
Religion is to keep yourself in balance.

01:13:56.834 --> 01:14:00.625
There are ten religions in the human being, like ten valencies.

01:14:00.834 --> 01:14:04.250
As carbon has four valencies, we have ten valencies.

01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:06.834
about which all the primordial masters

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.291
who came on this earth have taught.

01:14:09.542 --> 01:14:12.291
Like Lao Tze, like Socrates,

01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:17.458
we can say Abraham, Moses and many in India also.

01:14:17.667 --> 01:14:20.375
They came and told us that we should keep the balance,

01:14:20.583 --> 01:14:25.625
balance our life, keep in the center for the ascent.

01:14:25.875 --> 01:14:28.542
If you are not balanced you cannot ascend.

01:14:28.792 --> 01:14:31.834
But people have gone to extremes. They are faddists.

01:14:32.041 --> 01:14:35.166
Whatever you tell them, if you tell them that see,

01:14:35.417 --> 01:14:37.750
"now you are not well, so you do something."

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.208
They will do it so much that they’ll outwit everything, you see.

01:14:42.417 --> 01:14:45.750
They always go to the extreme of everything.

01:14:45.999 --> 01:14:49.999
So, that’s how the problems are there. But doesn’t matter.

01:14:50.250 --> 01:14:53.333
But moreover we are sick because we are seeking,

01:14:53.667 --> 01:14:55.834
because we are not satisfied.

01:14:56.083 --> 01:15:00.999
We feel unhappy, we can’t sleep, we don’t know why we are living.

01:15:03.458 --> 01:15:05.500
Is the other way round.

01:15:05.709 --> 01:15:07.542
We are not seeking because we are sick,

01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:11.500
but we are sick because we are seeking.

01:15:13.417 --> 01:15:18.083
Why is the Kundalini identified with female form?

01:15:18.417 --> 01:15:18.917
What?

01:15:19.083 --> 01:15:22.583
Why is Kundalini identified as a female form?

01:15:22.875 --> 01:15:25.834
Because it is the Power of God,

01:15:26.083 --> 01:15:29.125
and God is regarded as "He",

01:15:29.333 --> 01:15:32.500
and the Kundalini as the Mother.

01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:36.500
He as the Father, and the Holy Ghost as the Mother.

01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:38.000
She’s the Holy Ghost.

01:15:38.250 --> 01:15:41.291
So because He’s the Father, we have to have a lady with Him.

01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.250
So we call Her the Mother.

01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:45.625
And one should not feel bad about it,

01:15:45.834 --> 01:15:49.208
men should not feel bad at all because you all had a mother.

01:15:49.417 --> 01:15:51.625
You could not have come on this earth without a mother.

01:15:51.834 --> 01:15:54.667
You just can’t help it, that’s how the nature is.

01:15:54.959 --> 01:15:58.000
You have to accept the fact.

01:15:58.250 --> 01:16:01.999
Mother is a surety, isn’t it?

01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:07.208
Yes, please.

01:16:07.417 --> 01:16:08.999
Just first he and then you.

01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:11.291
Does Mother have a guru and

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:15.083
what point did She gained Self-realization?

01:16:15.333 --> 01:16:17.458
Do you have a guru and at what stage

01:16:17.667 --> 01:16:19.625
did You receive Self-realization?

01:16:19.875 --> 01:16:22.625
I neither have a guru nor I want you to have a guru.

01:16:22.834 --> 01:16:25.125
You better become your own gurus.

01:16:25.333 --> 01:16:27.417
Secondly I’ve been born like that,

01:16:27.667 --> 01:16:29.834
I never got any realization or anything.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.834
I just got realization, I should say human realization

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.041
when I understood what was the problem with human beings.

01:16:36.250 --> 01:16:39.417
I worked on the all permutations and combinations of human beings,

01:16:39.667 --> 01:16:42.375
because I wanted to have an en-masse media,

01:16:42.583 --> 01:16:45.166
by which I could give realization to thousands of people.

01:16:45.417 --> 01:16:49.583
Because any discovery which is made and is not brought to that level

01:16:49.834 --> 01:16:55.959
it is absolutely detrimental to the growth.

01:16:56.250 --> 01:17:00.125
For example, you see, Jesus was crucified. Why?

01:17:00.333 --> 01:17:05.834
Because He was alone! Only for His mother, nobody knew what He was.

01:17:06.083 --> 01:17:07.999
At that time He could not achieve this,

01:17:08.166 --> 01:17:11.166
because you all were not there at the time.

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:16.834
And also other people - you know how the saints have suffered,

01:17:17.083 --> 01:17:19.667
how every prophet has suffered because

01:17:19.875 --> 01:17:23.542
because they could not create a mass understanding of it.

01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:27.166
So at a certain point it has to become a mass thing.

01:17:27.417 --> 01:17:31.000
In the tree of life there are only three or four

01:17:31.208 --> 01:17:33.999
flowers in the beginning, but when it grows,

01:17:34.208 --> 01:17:38.083
when the blossom time comes, then so many flowers are there

01:17:38.333 --> 01:17:40.834
and they become the fruits.

01:17:41.166 --> 01:17:45.750
So I, I just saw that this is the time I have to do this job.

01:17:45.999 --> 01:17:48.542
So you would call it My "human" realization

01:17:48.750 --> 01:17:51.083
when I understood human beings.

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:54.125
Of course even now sometimes I get shocked the way they behave,

01:17:54.333 --> 01:18:01.125
I mean, I just don’t understand, but I think now I understand them.

01:18:02.125 --> 01:18:05.667
So those people who can’t quite understand that answer,

01:18:05.875 --> 01:18:07.041
don’t think about it too much.

01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:08.917
There's another gentlemen who was asking a question.

01:18:09.083 --> 01:18:11.999
Mother has to be somebody special, but find out for yourself.

01:18:12.166 --> 01:18:16.333
That’s the best way.
You don’t worry about Me, you worry about yourself.

01:18:16.583 --> 01:18:19.375
I must be someone, all right. Even if I’m not, doesn’t matter.

01:18:19.583 --> 01:18:21.667
If you are going to get it, why not have it?

01:18:21.999 --> 01:18:24.750
Who? The gentlemen there. Yes, please.

01:18:24.999 --> 01:18:28.375
Is that phase that You've given today, tomorrow, next day,

01:18:28.583 --> 01:18:31.083
I think on the [unclear] to call wholly

01:18:31.333 --> 01:18:34.250
or it just continues, or it stops like this.

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:38.500
No, tonight She just gave an introductory lecture.

01:18:38.834 --> 01:18:40.291
Tomorrow night and the next night

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:42.583
She will cover completely the subtle body.

01:18:42.834 --> 01:18:44.583
All right.

01:18:44.959 --> 01:18:47.250
The whole system.

01:18:47.542 --> 01:18:50.834
But You shouldn’t come late tomorrow.

01:18:52.834 --> 01:18:55.083
What if we can't get the three days?

01:18:55.333 --> 01:18:56.125
What is she saying?

01:18:56.333 --> 01:18:58.667
If you can’t get the three days and you seriously want

01:18:58.917 --> 01:19:01.333
to settle into it, the film is being taken. They'll be showing it.

01:19:01.583 --> 01:19:03.999
But why are you worried? Let us see for the present.

01:19:04.166 --> 01:19:08.417
Why should be in the future? You will get it. Why not?

01:19:08.667 --> 01:19:10.125
Why makes you, what makes you think,

01:19:10.333 --> 01:19:12.375
if you don’t get it, you are not going to miss it.

01:19:12.583 --> 01:19:13.999
We have people here,

01:19:14.166 --> 01:19:17.583
we have luckily an ashram, a beautiful place, you’ll like it,

01:19:17.834 --> 01:19:21.083
you can go there, they will give it to you.

01:19:23.166 --> 01:19:25.375
Listen, may I ask a question please?

01:19:25.583 --> 01:19:26.125
Yes.

01:19:26.333 --> 01:19:30.417
What is the first step to Self-realization?

01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:35.000
What is the first step to Self-realization?

01:19:35.333 --> 01:19:39.417
There is nothing like first, second. It's not a course, you see.

01:19:39.667 --> 01:19:44.083
The Kundalini, it's an awakening within us which takes place,

01:19:44.333 --> 01:19:46.917
which is like a living process. All right?

01:19:47.083 --> 01:19:50.333
So the Kundalini rises and shoots off here.

01:19:50.583 --> 01:19:56.500
Now, some people feel the Kundalini wobbling down there, down below.

01:19:56.959 --> 01:19:59.208
Some people feel it in the stomach.

01:19:59.417 --> 01:20:03.041
Some people feel it here; some people feel it here;

01:20:03.250 --> 01:20:07.000
but most of them feel it here only, jetting out like cool breeze.

01:20:07.250 --> 01:20:10.166
So you just can’t say what is the first step,

01:20:10.417 --> 01:20:14.041
depends on how it rises.

01:20:14.333 --> 01:20:16.583
So, everybody doesn’t feel the same way,

01:20:16.792 --> 01:20:21.417
So I can’t say that this is the first stage. All right?

01:20:22.917 --> 01:20:26.166
Of course first you feel thoughtlessly aware.

01:20:26.417 --> 01:20:29.709
You become thoughtlessly aware, first thing that should happen to you

01:20:29.917 --> 01:20:32.000
when the Kundalini crosses this center.

01:20:32.250 --> 01:20:35.417
When it comes out of it, you start feeling the cool breeze here,

01:20:35.625 --> 01:20:38.291
and you start feeling the cool breeze in your hands,

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.667
and you start feeling the cool breeze around.

01:20:40.917 --> 01:20:43.750
That’s the second stage where it can go

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.458
but some people really are so great

01:20:46.667 --> 01:20:49.750
that they become absolutely doubtlessly aware,

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.959
what we call as Nirvikalpa. They achieve that.

01:20:52.166 --> 01:20:54.250
Some of them are really, they are just there.

01:20:54.458 --> 01:20:57.542
They are so beautifully made that they just become that.

01:20:57.750 --> 01:21:01.125
There’s no question left in their mind but they become so powerful.

01:21:01.333 --> 01:21:04.333
I’m amazed sometimes how they become so solid,

01:21:04.542 --> 01:21:06.834
really understanding themselves.

01:21:07.083 --> 01:21:10.500
So there are some people, I've known, who are very, very great

01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:13.750
and they just start emitting vibrations,

01:21:13.999 --> 01:21:17.333
they start giving realization, they start curing people.

01:21:17.583 --> 01:21:20.417
They can do it!

01:21:21.917 --> 01:21:23.999
So don’t condemn yourself in any way.

01:21:24.166 --> 01:21:27.041
That’s first condition in Sahaja Yoga.

01:21:27.250 --> 01:21:29.999
So should we now have realization?

01:21:30.166 --> 01:21:32.375
Those people are sitting very much behind

01:21:32.583 --> 01:21:36.834
should come in line with others, will be better idea.

01:21:37.875 --> 01:21:42.667
Yes, just move in, as much as possible, nearer.

01:21:43.583 --> 01:21:45.999
If you just slip your shoes off it helps you to...

01:21:46.166 --> 01:21:49.834
Yes, it is much better, because this Mother Earth helps you.

01:21:50.083 --> 01:21:53.500
Better to take out your shoes, will help.

01:21:56.583 --> 01:22:00.750
If some people want to sit on the ground, also it’s all right,

01:22:00.999 --> 01:22:03.375
but you should not be very far away

01:22:03.583 --> 01:22:09.083
because it’s better to attend to them. All right?

01:22:09.417 --> 01:22:11.000
If there are chairs here, yes.

01:22:11.250 --> 01:22:12.333
There are plenty there.

01:22:12.583 --> 01:22:13.333
Good.

01:22:13.583 --> 01:22:14.542
There are plenty of chairs here.

01:22:14.750 --> 01:22:17.999
The children can come here, come along, come and sit here.

01:22:18.208 --> 01:22:22.834
There’s a lot of room for the children. Children are the best.

01:22:23.083 --> 01:22:25.333
I’m very happy to see them here.

01:22:25.583 --> 01:22:28.834
All right, come along, sit down, sit down. Please come along.

01:22:29.083 --> 01:22:33.999
Look at their confidence! Sit down. Oh, great.

01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:35.625
Just slip your shoes off.

01:22:35.917 --> 01:22:39.583
Just slip out your shoes, all right? Great people.

01:22:39.834 --> 01:22:43.500
You too, you too. Yes, please take out his shoes.

01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:48.750
Just help him. You see, look at him, how he is alert.

01:22:50.875 --> 01:22:54.625
There are so many children as I told you, are realised souls.

01:22:54.875 --> 01:22:58.667
And we have to understand them. All right.

01:22:59.417 --> 01:23:04.041
So now, you have to just put your hands towards Me like this.

01:23:04.250 --> 01:23:06.999
Simple. Put your both the feet on the ground.

01:23:07.166 --> 01:23:11.041
Touch the Mother Earth with your feet, just. And be relaxed.

01:23:11.250 --> 01:23:15.000
You are not to do anything that will make you tense,

01:23:15.250 --> 01:23:19.999
means if you have anything tight here, or tight there just loosen it.

01:23:20.291 --> 01:23:23.542
Do not tighten your body also too much, don’t push back your head,

01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:28.999
or push forward, just be in a relaxed way, sit straight.

01:23:29.250 --> 01:23:31.542
Put your hands towards Me like this.

01:23:31.792 --> 01:23:35.041
And as I said the first condition is,

01:23:35.291 --> 01:23:40.542
to say that “Mother I am not guilty”, at least sixteen times.

01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:44.083
Is a punishment for people who feel that way.

01:23:45.917 --> 01:23:50.750
Before we start, let us tell ourselves that we are not guilty,

01:23:50.999 --> 01:23:55.166
because I am talking of God Almighty.

01:23:55.667 --> 01:23:58.583
He is the source of all joy,

01:23:58.875 --> 01:24:01.375
but He is the ocean of love,

01:24:01.583 --> 01:24:04.000
He’s the ocean of forgiveness,

01:24:04.250 --> 01:24:06.417
He’s the ocean of compassion.

01:24:06.667 --> 01:24:09.083
And what mistakes can we commit?

01:24:09.417 --> 01:24:14.999
So don’t start with your guilt at all. You are all God’s people,

01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:16.999
you must get your realization.

01:24:17.166 --> 01:24:19.291
So, just tell yourself,

01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:22.333
closing your eyes, in your heart,

01:24:22.583 --> 01:24:24.917
“Mother I am not guilty”. You say it sixteen times,

01:24:25.083 --> 01:24:27.750
is the best way, because there are sixteen petals here,

01:24:27.959 --> 01:24:31.999
and this is the center gets blocked if you feel guilty.

01:24:33.125 --> 01:24:37.750
Please close your eyes, and don’t open your eyes till I tell you.

01:24:37.999 --> 01:24:39.417
Now, just close your eyes, see.

01:24:39.625 --> 01:24:43.834
Do you feel the cool breeze in your hand? The children?

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.458
Yes, that’s it. The children are already feeling it,

01:24:46.667 --> 01:24:50.500
all born-realised. Just imagine.

01:24:56.625 --> 01:25:01.417
Look at that. You should, you should have brought our children also,

01:25:01.667 --> 01:25:07.250
so sweet they are. Are you feeling?

01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:12.417
Good. You are all realised souls, that’s why you’ve come here.

01:25:12.999 --> 01:25:18.999
Now, the left hand, as I said, is the power of desire,

01:25:19.166 --> 01:25:21.999
so you put it towards Me, left side.

01:25:22.166 --> 01:25:24.625
That means you have to desire your realization.

01:25:24.875 --> 01:25:27.000
Keep it comfortably on your lap, it’s all right.

01:25:27.250 --> 01:25:30.667
Now, the right hand represents the power of action,

01:25:30.917 --> 01:25:34.834
so we have to use right hand to symbolically suggest

01:25:35.083 --> 01:25:39.208
our desire through this action.

01:25:39.458 --> 01:25:42.000
First of all put your right hand - don’t open your eyes,

01:25:42.250 --> 01:25:45.458
please don’t open your eyes at any cost, that’s important.

01:25:45.709 --> 01:25:47.166
Because if you open your eyes,

01:25:47.375 --> 01:25:51.166
the Kundalini won’t rise above Agnya Chakra.

01:25:51.417 --> 01:25:55.000
Now put your right hand on your heart.

01:25:56.583 --> 01:25:59.333
Don’t worry about anything, whether you are going to get it or not,

01:25:59.583 --> 01:26:02.041
but just put it - put little -

01:26:02.250 --> 01:26:07.625
sit little straight, you should not slouch down, yes.

01:26:07.959 --> 01:26:11.750
Put your - please put it on your heart.

01:26:11.999 --> 01:26:16.959
And now say in your heart that “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

01:26:17.125 --> 01:26:19.834
Ask a question.

01:26:25.083 --> 01:26:28.750
Because Spirit resides in the heart.

01:26:28.999 --> 01:26:33.291
Just ask a question, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:36.667
Ask three times.

01:26:41.583 --> 01:26:43.417
It's cool.

01:26:45.083 --> 01:26:50.834
Now put down your right hand on your stomach, on the left-hand side.

01:26:51.083 --> 01:26:54.000
Now this is your guru principle, is your master principle,

01:26:54.250 --> 01:26:56.083
which has to be awakened.

01:26:56.333 --> 01:27:00.917
So you say, ten times,

01:27:01.083 --> 01:27:05.750
“Mother, I am my own guru, I am my own master.”

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:11.834
Just assert it, it's there. You just have to say it before Me.

01:27:13.583 --> 01:27:17.291
“I am my own master.”

01:27:17.542 --> 01:27:19.375
If you have been to some gurus or anything,

01:27:19.583 --> 01:27:22.750
it will be all neutralised with it.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.917
So just say “Mother, I am my own master.”

01:27:25.083 --> 01:27:28.417
Because these gurus, actually kill that Spirit in you,

01:27:28.792 --> 01:27:32.417
kill that principle in you.

01:27:38.875 --> 01:27:42.500
Please say it ten times.

01:27:48.583 --> 01:27:53.750
Now again raise your right hand to your heart.

01:27:54.166 --> 01:27:56.166
And now with full confidence in yourself,

01:27:56.417 --> 01:27:59.333
because as you know, you are the temple of God,

01:27:59.583 --> 01:28:04.083
say that “Mother, I am the Spirit.”

01:28:04.417 --> 01:28:09.166
Say it twelve times, “Mother I am the Spirit.”

01:28:22.999 --> 01:28:26.417
It's on the Void. You put your hand.

01:28:33.166 --> 01:28:38.583
All right. You can use the light behind Me. You put that.

01:28:38.999 --> 01:28:46.959
Now, raise the same hand higher, onto the forehead.

01:28:48.458 --> 01:28:51.999
We have missed one center where you had to say

01:28:52.166 --> 01:28:55.999
“Mother I’m not guilty”. Because the Spirit cannot be guilty.

01:28:56.250 --> 01:28:59.750
It is sinless. But here at this point

01:28:59.999 --> 01:29:03.333
you have to say “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

01:29:03.625 --> 01:29:07.333
Now some of them said that “Mother it is difficult to forgive.”

01:29:07.583 --> 01:29:12.417
But it is a myth that you are not forgiving. It’s absolutely myth.

01:29:12.667 --> 01:29:15.500
You are doing nothing to that person who has harmed you,

01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:17.625
or to those persons who have harmed you.

01:29:17.875 --> 01:29:19.458
You are just harming yourself.

01:29:19.667 --> 01:29:21.333
So just put your hand across,

01:29:21.583 --> 01:29:26.125
hold it tight and say “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

01:29:26.333 --> 01:29:29.333
Hold it, just press it a little bit from both the sides.

01:29:29.583 --> 01:29:33.166
Hold it properly and just press it.

01:29:34.166 --> 01:29:37.917
Squeeze in, I think, towards the center,

01:29:38.125 --> 01:29:44.500
so that all extremes will disappear in the center.

01:29:47.667 --> 01:29:51.834
Now put this hand on top of your head,

01:29:52.458 --> 01:29:54.208
near the fontanelle bone area,

01:29:54.417 --> 01:29:59.250
where you had a very soft bone as a child.

01:29:59.625 --> 01:30:02.166
Try to press it with your palm.

01:30:02.417 --> 01:30:07.417
Try to press it with your palm. It’s quite heavy still.

01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:11.000
At this point I can’t cross your freedom.

01:30:11.250 --> 01:30:14.000
So you have to say, “Mother, I want realization,

01:30:14.250 --> 01:30:15.792
please give me realization."

01:30:15.999 --> 01:30:19.041
You have to ask for it, otherwise I cannot force it into you.

01:30:19.291 --> 01:30:22.750
Say it seven times please.

01:30:31.834 --> 01:30:35.166
It's there. Still some Void.

01:30:35.417 --> 01:30:38.583
Void and Agnya.

01:30:40.999 --> 01:30:44.583
Now you raise the same hand for a while, on top of your head,

01:30:44.834 --> 01:30:46.625
and see if there’s a cool breeze coming in.

01:30:46.834 --> 01:30:51.834
Just move it forward, backwards.

01:30:52.417 --> 01:30:56.750
See if there’s a cool breeze coming out. Good? All right.

01:30:56.999 --> 01:31:01.166
You can change over now. Don’t open your eyes, but change over.

01:31:01.417 --> 01:31:04.542
See from the other hand. Put the right hand towards Me,

01:31:04.792 --> 01:31:06.834
and put the left hand on top of your head,

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:11.083
and see if there’s a cool breeze coming in.

01:31:26.417 --> 01:31:32.667
First you will feel it on top of your head and then in your hands.

01:31:59.166 --> 01:32:02.083
You can always change your hand and see.

01:32:02.417 --> 01:32:04.166
Once this hand, once that hand.

01:32:04.417 --> 01:32:07.667
But don’t open your eyes. But put the other hand towards Me.

01:32:15.583 --> 01:32:17.500
It’s very cool.

01:32:54.083 --> 01:32:55.999
Now, if you have felt on your head

01:32:56.166 --> 01:32:58.166
just try to put your hands towards Me,

01:32:58.417 --> 01:33:02.583
and see that, if you are feeling it in your hands.

01:33:06.125 --> 01:33:09.834
Further, you are seeing at the back, now see it in front.

01:33:10.083 --> 01:33:14.875
Now in the hands you might feel it, just try in your hands.

01:33:23.375 --> 01:33:26.625
You may raise your hands high, up like this. You can open your eyes

01:33:26.834 --> 01:33:30.625
and raise your hands like this. And ask a question,

01:33:30.875 --> 01:33:33.583
that, “Is this the power of God?

01:33:33.834 --> 01:33:38.750
Is this the power of Holy Ghost?

01:33:38.999 --> 01:33:43.999
Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?” Just ask the question.

01:33:58.250 --> 01:34:01.750
Are you feeling it? Something happening in the fingers,

01:34:01.999 --> 01:34:07.667
You’ll feel very relaxed, first of all. Extremely relaxed.

01:34:08.917 --> 01:34:13.417
All right? Now just see if it is happening.

01:34:19.667 --> 01:34:23.083
In your hands. Just see in your hands. Put them back.

01:34:23.333 --> 01:34:28.500
All right? Is there now? Not yet?

01:34:28.834 --> 01:34:31.250
How many of you are feeling the cool breeze in the head?

01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:35.417
Please raise your hands. It's good?

01:34:35.792 --> 01:34:38.834
And in the hands?

01:34:39.250 --> 01:34:43.999
Only in the hands. All right, it will work out.

01:34:44.166 --> 01:34:46.417
Now keep your eyes open.

01:34:46.667 --> 01:34:51.750
I’ll tell you another way, how you can raise your own Kundalini.

01:34:52.083 --> 01:34:54.667
You just watch Me and you do the same.

01:34:54.999 --> 01:34:56.083
You put your left hand,

01:34:56.291 --> 01:34:59.166
near towards your Kundalini like this, while sitting down.

01:34:59.417 --> 01:35:02.999
Let’s see. Now, sit little erect, all right?

01:35:03.166 --> 01:35:07.250
Now. And then, this right hand is to be used like this,

01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:09.792
you put the right hand across,

01:35:09.999 --> 01:35:14.500
front, below, back, up. Like that.

01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:19.834
You move the right hand like this.

01:35:20.291 --> 01:35:25.333
Just start moving it. Now bring it higher, over your head,

01:35:25.583 --> 01:35:31.417
put it high, and just turn it, give it a twist and tie it up.

01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:38.417
Try again please. Put this hand in front like this,

01:35:38.834 --> 01:35:42.333
with the right hand you start moving in this manner,

01:35:42.583 --> 01:35:44.041
which is a clockwise manner.

01:35:44.250 --> 01:35:46.999
Just start moving, move it properly, that’s very important.

01:35:47.166 --> 01:35:48.999
Keep one hand steadily moving.

01:35:49.166 --> 01:35:53.166
Now give it a twist again and one other knot.

01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:57.458
There are three powers, so for the third power we give three knots,

01:35:57.667 --> 01:36:02.250
not putting down our hands. Now let’s do again.

01:36:06.875 --> 01:36:11.041
Now put it up. Tie it up once, you don’t put down the hands.

01:36:11.250 --> 01:36:15.166
Again, give it a twist,

01:36:15.417 --> 01:36:20.166
knot, another one, nicely.

01:36:20.834 --> 01:36:24.667
Now see if you are feeling the cool breeze.

01:36:35.250 --> 01:36:39.083
Feeling?

01:36:39.333 --> 01:36:42.667
You can open your eyes.

01:36:47.250 --> 01:36:50.000
Now more people must be feeling cool breeze in their heads.

01:36:50.250 --> 01:36:53.000
It's so high as that, some people are feeling, yes, too.

01:36:53.250 --> 01:36:58.166
You can feel it higher, lower, anywhere. Just see.

01:37:01.959 --> 01:37:03.625
If you don’t feel it you have to say,

01:37:03.875 --> 01:37:06.125
“Please give me realisation Mother”, that’s all.

01:37:06.333 --> 01:37:11.208
You have to ask for it, that’s all, with your full heart.

01:37:11.417 --> 01:37:16.583
It’s there. All right? Good. Just ask for it.

01:37:16.834 --> 01:37:22.333
Just for the asking, because that’s your own right.

01:37:22.667 --> 01:37:27.333
All right? All the children have got it; beautifully.

01:37:27.667 --> 01:37:29.834
So may God bless you all.

01:37:30.041 --> 01:37:32.542
I’ll be here tomorrow again,

01:37:32.750 --> 01:37:36.999
and I’ll tell you about the imbalances we have, how we create them,

01:37:37.166 --> 01:37:39.583
how to get over them.

01:37:39.875 --> 01:37:44.000
In two lectures I hope I’ll be able to cover lot of things.

01:37:44.291 --> 01:37:47.667
But as you know, knowledge is like an ocean,

01:37:47.917 --> 01:37:50.999
and I don’t know how many lectures so far I have given,

01:37:51.166 --> 01:37:55.750
thousands, and so many are on the tape,

01:37:55.999 --> 01:37:57.500
and you can listen to them,

01:37:57.750 --> 01:38:01.166
about various dimensions of our Spirituality.

01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:05.000
What is the Spirit, how it manifests,

01:38:05.250 --> 01:38:08.667
what is the creation, everything is there.

01:38:08.917 --> 01:38:12.583
You can come to our ashram, which is a very beautiful place,

01:38:12.834 --> 01:38:16.333
and can listen to it, you can borrow from them

01:38:16.583 --> 01:38:18.917
and enjoy it for yourself.

01:38:19.166 --> 01:38:21.834
Tomorrow I hope to see you again, and day after,

01:38:22.083 --> 01:38:26.500
so I establish this realization with you.

01:38:26.834 --> 01:38:31.041
I would request you to bring some salt, sugar and water tomorrow,

01:38:31.250 --> 01:38:36.999
which I can vibrate for you, which will be a good thing to take.

01:38:37.417 --> 01:38:41.667
Just bring little bit not much is needed, just to vibrate.

01:38:41.999 --> 01:38:45.166
Thank you very much.

01:38:52.166 --> 01:38:56.999
I think tonight we’ll let Mother go home. She’s had a long day.

01:38:57.250 --> 01:39:00.208
And take the chance of meeting Her tomorrow night…

01:39:00.458 --> 01:39:02.542
I’ll meet everyone, individually, tomorrow,

01:39:02.750 --> 01:39:05.166
because today they fixed Me up with everything,

01:39:05.417 --> 01:39:10.291
television, radio, this, that. I was rushing everywhere, you see,

01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:14.750
and, I came in the morning by plane and you know what it is like.

01:39:14.999 --> 01:39:17.750
So if you could excuse Me today,

01:39:17.999 --> 01:39:20.417
tomorrow I'll be definitely here for a longer period,

01:39:20.667 --> 01:39:22.750
and I’ll meet all of you individually.

01:39:22.999 --> 01:39:24.583
And also if you have any questions,

01:39:24.834 --> 01:39:29.417
it’s better that you write them down in a paper and bring it here.

01:39:29.667 --> 01:39:30.750
Another thing I would suggest,

01:39:30.999 --> 01:39:32.500
that you must take the books, if you got the books.

01:39:32.750 --> 01:39:33.250
Yes.

01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:35.166
Books, but don’t read them tonight

01:39:35.417 --> 01:39:38.500
because again your head will be off.

01:39:38.959 --> 01:39:42.250
But you can take the photograph, and

01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:45.458
you can put your hands towards the photograph

01:39:45.709 --> 01:39:48.250
with a light before it. Because photograph has got vibrations.

01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:50.500
It has the same coefficient, it gives vibrations.

01:39:50.750 --> 01:39:52.375
Luckily, you see, very good.

01:39:52.583 --> 01:39:55.041
So if you put your left hand toward the photograph,

01:39:55.250 --> 01:39:57.166
first, with a light,

01:39:57.417 --> 01:39:59.834
you will start gradually feeling the cool breeze,

01:40:00.083 --> 01:40:01.417
right hand outside like that,

01:40:01.667 --> 01:40:03.917
you see like an outlet given.

01:40:04.166 --> 01:40:06.999
The whole thing that’s wrong there, passes out of this hand.

01:40:07.208 --> 01:40:09.291
Then you put your right hand towards the photograph,

01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:11.041
and the left hand outside.

01:40:11.250 --> 01:40:14.000
At this time, before sleeping if you do it,

01:40:14.250 --> 01:40:18.291
you can have a little basin of water,

01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:20.375
in which you can put some salt,

01:40:20.583 --> 01:40:24.834
and put your feet in it so the water sucks in problems within you.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.250
It’s very interesting to use all the five elements.

01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:29.125
We are using light,

01:40:29.333 --> 01:40:32.999
we can use the water, every sort of thing is to be used,

01:40:33.166 --> 01:40:35.083
just to give us proper balance.

01:40:35.333 --> 01:40:39.999
So, I hope you take the photograph and do the needful tonight.

01:40:40.166 --> 01:40:42.208
And don’t discuss about it, talk about it,

01:40:42.417 --> 01:40:45.291
because you cannot understand it with this limited brain.

01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:48.208
It’s an unlimited space where you have gone.

01:40:48.458 --> 01:40:51.999
Thank you very much. May God bless you.

01:40:55.166 --> 01:41:00.375
As you leave tonight, for those people who would like to follow it up

01:41:00.583 --> 01:41:04.083
we are very happy to let you know, where we meet each week,

01:41:04.291 --> 01:41:07.166
so that you could learn about Kundalini,

01:41:07.417 --> 01:41:10.875
about the chakras and develop your realization.

01:41:11.041 --> 01:41:14.083
So give to the person standing at the back

01:41:14.291 --> 01:41:15.542
your address and your telephone number.

01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:17.667
Why don’t you tell them address now? No harm.

01:41:17.917 --> 01:41:18.709
No, certainly.

01:41:18.917 --> 01:41:22.834
And the telephone number it's better if you write it down.

01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:25.834
Also give your name, but also...

01:41:26.041 --> 01:41:32.375
We have the ashram, the center is at 1267 Burke Road Kew.

01:41:32.583 --> 01:41:33.125
Again.

01:41:33.333 --> 01:41:37.041
1267 Burke Road Kew.

01:41:37.250 --> 01:41:39.500
Is it very easy to get to the road,

01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:42.625
there's two tram stop practically on the doorstep.

01:41:42.834 --> 01:41:44.834
However, that address is written

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.834
or it's stamped on the bottom of a sheet

01:41:47.041 --> 01:41:49.250
that is enclosed in the little booklet that we have

01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:52.375
at the back of the hall. Our phone number also is there.

01:41:52.583 --> 01:41:57.125
It's 801696. You’re very welcome to come and see us.

01:41:57.333 --> 01:42:01.834
On Sunday as at the moment we’re planning to have a workshop,

01:42:02.083 --> 01:42:05.333
where you are all welcome to come and spend time with Mother,

01:42:05.583 --> 01:42:08.625
and She will be able to talk to you more closely and

01:42:08.875 --> 01:42:12.417
show you in more practical ways how Sahaja Yoga,

01:42:12.667 --> 01:42:16.583
how this Kundalini awakening can work within you.

01:42:16.999 --> 01:42:21.166
When Mother said "bring salt sugar and water", it's to bring

01:42:21.417 --> 01:42:25.208
a small quantity of those particular substances because they can act

01:42:25.417 --> 01:42:30.083
upon our subtle body because they embody some of the essences

01:42:30.333 --> 01:42:33.000
that we have within ourselves. Just a small quantity

01:42:33.250 --> 01:42:35.667
in an opened packet, you know, so that it's easy, easy to reach, ok?

01:42:35.917 --> 01:42:38.750
Plastic bag or something.

01:42:38.999 --> 01:42:40.166
Take the addresses then.

01:42:40.458 --> 01:42:45.166
Oh, yes. And just for your own sake as much as anything,

01:42:45.458 --> 01:42:50.208
what often happens is, you know, it's quite hard to even comprehend

01:42:50.417 --> 01:42:52.709
what's gone on this evening, ok.

01:42:52.917 --> 01:42:57.999
You’ve come along, you've been given realization and you know

01:42:58.166 --> 01:43:01.625
it’s way beyond our own comprehension as to what's really happened

01:43:01.875 --> 01:43:05.250
and it's so easy to go away and think, "Oh, no, no.

01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:08.250
They were telling me stories. It couldn’t possibly be true."

01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:12.166
It is true, believe it. We can help you find that out,

01:43:12.458 --> 01:43:16.333
and establish it within yourself and just to help you,

01:43:16.583 --> 01:43:18.333
if you can give us your names and addresses.

01:43:18.583 --> 01:43:21.250
I’m certainly not forcing you to do it or anything like that

01:43:21.542 --> 01:43:24.000
but if you can do that, then we can keep in touch with you

01:43:24.250 --> 01:43:26.667
and help you establish it further.

01:43:26.917 --> 01:43:31.583
One instant God. I mean afterall, you must know that sometimes,

01:43:31.834 --> 01:43:34.750
it may take little time. Of course, it works instantly,

01:43:34.999 --> 01:43:37.375
but if something wrong inside then it takes time.

01:43:37.583 --> 01:43:40.166
So give more time to yourself, little patience with yourself,

01:43:40.417 --> 01:43:42.417
as I have patience with you.

01:43:42.667 --> 01:43:44.583
You must have some patience with yourself

01:43:44.834 --> 01:43:48.125
and just try to understand that this has to work out.

01:43:48.333 --> 01:43:49.834
That’s very important.

01:43:50.083 --> 01:43:53.625
If it has not worked out, it will have to be worked out.

01:43:53.834 --> 01:43:56.333
May God bless you.
