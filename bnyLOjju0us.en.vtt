00:05:51.887 --> 00:06:00.468
Shri Mahakali Puja, Salvador-Bahia (Brazil), 14 October 1992.

00:06:04.173 --> 00:06:13.387
It is so nice to be here in Brazil in Salvador.

00:06:16.513 --> 00:06:19.458
I met one gentleman a long time back,

00:06:19.658 --> 00:06:24.617
from my husband’s office, from Brazil,

00:06:24.817 --> 00:06:30.390
and his wife was suffering from terrible black magic.

00:06:31.645 --> 00:06:35.216
And she really was cured of that trouble.

00:06:35.403 --> 00:06:39.274
So he told me that, you have to go to Brazil

00:06:39.474 --> 00:06:42.415
because it is full of lots of negative things

00:06:42.615 --> 00:06:47.337
specially the black magic, so you must go there somehow.

00:06:48.231 --> 00:06:50.683
And so it was my great desire to come here

00:06:50.883 --> 00:06:54.321
and that’s how I came, few years back.

00:06:54.488 --> 00:06:58.082
Also Duilio was here and, I mean, things were arranged

00:06:58.282 --> 00:07:02.409
somehow, Sahaj, so I came here.

00:07:03.171 --> 00:07:11.359
So the problem of this country is more, is this black magic

00:07:11.559 --> 00:07:15.869
that is brought by the people from Africa.

00:07:18.733 --> 00:07:23.458
So I have thought today, we, let us have Mahakali Puja.

00:07:27.429 --> 00:07:33.251
Mahakali is the left side power in us.

00:07:34.991 --> 00:07:39.936
So, actually She is Adi Shakti.

00:07:40.428 --> 00:07:43.751
Only when she enters into the left side of the Virata

00:07:43.959 --> 00:07:50.419
we call her Mahakali, but she is the power of pure desire of God.

00:07:51.457 --> 00:07:56.433
Then She establishes Shri Ganesha herself.

00:07:59.113 --> 00:08:03.788
Then she goes to the right side as Mahasaraswati,

00:08:04.441 --> 00:08:11.742
and then she enters into the centre where she is Mahalakshmi.

00:08:12.426 --> 00:08:17.829
That is how Adi Shakti takes three forms.

00:08:18.652 --> 00:08:22.220
But Mahakali is the pure form,

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:25.085
because she’s not yet deep in,

00:08:25.285 --> 00:08:30.150
I mean, from Adi Shakti, she’s Mahakali.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:35.162
So first thing She, before creating this universe or anything,

00:08:35.362 --> 00:08:38.854
She created Shri Ganesha.

00:08:40.098 --> 00:08:46.144
And first to spread, manifest

00:08:46.344 --> 00:08:54.524
not only holiness but also auspiciousness, and purity.

00:08:55.705 --> 00:08:58.671
So before anything was created,

00:08:58.871 --> 00:09:01.354
these spiritual forces were created,

00:09:01.554 --> 00:09:06.072
to protect the creation that was to follow.

00:09:06.193 --> 00:09:11.700
So this Mahakali force was specially in the purest form

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:17.175
to protect people from the negative side.

00:09:20.248 --> 00:09:25.265
Now when any thought enters our mind,

00:09:25.465 --> 00:09:31.893
any reasoning concept of our mind,

00:09:32.094 --> 00:09:36.871
it is thrown on the left side by this Mahakali.

00:09:37.072 --> 00:09:41.512
- Throw out? - Goes to the left side. Subconscious.

00:09:41.712 --> 00:09:45.441
- Every bad thought ? No. - See whatever thought comes to us.

00:09:45.641 --> 00:09:51.632
Today is the support now, just now, that goes to the left side, has.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:56.572
And then that is how the present becomes the past,

00:09:56.772 --> 00:10:00.590
goes to the subconscious.

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:06.126
Now the subconscious also has many layers

00:10:06.326 --> 00:10:11.761
which are on the left side in a parallel way,

00:10:11.786 --> 00:10:16.286
not horizontally, but parallel.

00:10:16.598 --> 00:10:19.527
There are seven of these layers,

00:10:19.727 --> 00:10:27.124
and the seventh one ends up into the Collective Subconscious.

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.256
So whatever is dead, in the past,

00:10:31.456 --> 00:10:36.192
and was discarded from the evolutionary process,

00:10:36.392 --> 00:10:40.819
is thrown into the Collective Subconscious.

00:10:42.344 --> 00:10:46.350
Now when –

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:52.428
say for example, lives which were thrown out of the evolution,

00:10:52.628 --> 00:10:57.142
microscopic animals, whatever, viruses,

00:10:57.342 --> 00:10:59.699
then also human beings, animals,

00:10:59.899 --> 00:11:03.770
everything that was thrown, like mammoths and all that,

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:09.291
these animals were thrown out of the evolution, are.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:16.807
So the people who are living more in the past,

00:11:17.007 --> 00:11:26.610
if by any accident or by any unhappy incident in life,

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:31.358
are thrown towards that, they catch

00:11:31.558 --> 00:11:37.177
some of this Collective Subconscious.

00:11:39.869 --> 00:11:45.418
So also, this lifetime, whatever conditionings we have,

00:11:45.618 --> 00:11:54.467
also pass into our, they pass into our subconscious mind.

00:11:59.031 --> 00:12:07.300
For example, a person is sitting in the darkness alone,

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.945
suddenly starts feeling the fear.

00:12:11.145 --> 00:12:16.286
Then he is, with that fear, he’s thrown towards the left side

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:20.745
and he can catch something, what we call as ‘bhoots’, you see,

00:12:20.945 --> 00:12:24.515
what we call bhoots is some sort of a dead spirit

00:12:24.715 --> 00:12:28.947
and then he becomes a different person.

00:12:28.994 --> 00:12:32.406
Also, somebody who is too much right-sided, is always active,

00:12:32.622 --> 00:12:37.288
thinking too much of the future,

00:12:38.332 --> 00:12:44.308
his attention moves to the extreme, say, to the right side.

00:12:44.982 --> 00:12:50.201
Then suddenly if some shock or some fear, or whatever it is,

00:12:50.401 --> 00:12:56.227
this pendulum like thing, can move to the other side also.

00:12:57.298 --> 00:12:59.941
So all the people who are very right-sided

00:13:00.141 --> 00:13:05.441
can get into problems of possessions

00:13:05.641 --> 00:13:07.672
Sahaja Yogi : Of subconscious?
Shri Mataji : Of possessions.

00:13:07.873 --> 00:13:11.807
Sahaja Yogi : But, of subconscious?
Shri Mataji : Subconscious also.

00:13:12.574 --> 00:13:21.425
Also people who are extremely meticulous, extremely futuristic,

00:13:21.625 --> 00:13:26.642
can catch on the right side also Collective Supraconscious.

00:13:26.788 --> 00:13:34.267
Shri Mataji corrects him : Supraconcious.. Right side, it’s the right side. Futuristic.

00:13:36.109 --> 00:13:41.855
Now the - We have to now understand MahaKali’s powers.

00:13:43.222 --> 00:13:48.007
We have to understnd now Mahakali's Powers.

00:13:50.658 --> 00:13:58.901
Now MahaKali’s powers are such that She is the Holy Ghost.

00:14:00.578 --> 00:14:08.976
So firstly She can cure any diseases that come from viruses,

00:14:09.765 --> 00:14:13.096
like say from AIDS. You can start from Mooladhara up,

00:14:13.296 --> 00:14:17.477
all Mooladhara diseases, then all Swadisthana diseases,

00:14:17.677 --> 00:14:20.749
all these diseases.

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:24.208
Left Vishuddhi of course, is a combination,

00:14:24.408 --> 00:14:29.732
because when a man is too right-sided to balance his ego

00:14:29.932 --> 00:14:34.187
he puts it here in the guilt.

00:14:35.485 --> 00:14:41.949
So it could be a combination of both right and left.

00:14:42.264 --> 00:14:47.216
But all other incurable diseases are left-sided.

00:14:48.294 --> 00:14:52.994
Like you have cancer.

00:14:53.882 --> 00:14:56.395
Now see this is the left side centre

00:14:56.595 --> 00:15:01.089
and this is the right side centre, they look like this.

00:15:02.039 --> 00:15:04.197
So this is left side, this is right side

00:15:04.398 --> 00:15:08.332
and in the centre is the centre.

00:15:08.554 --> 00:15:12.555
Now supposing even if you have a thing of the right side, too much,

00:15:12.756 --> 00:15:17.330
the energy is driven to the right side.

00:15:18.192 --> 00:15:21.659
But suddenly something may happen, you see, some accident,

00:15:21.859 --> 00:15:26.447
some sort of unhappiness and this little bit can break like that,

00:15:26.647 --> 00:15:30.044
from the left side.

00:15:30.747 --> 00:15:36.787
So the virus can start flowing into the right side also.

00:15:37.175 --> 00:15:40.898
Now when this virus enters into the right side

00:15:41.099 --> 00:15:45.651
you have no connection with the whole, because it’s broken now.

00:15:46.074 --> 00:15:49.874
So this right side starts working on its own

00:15:50.074 --> 00:15:55.187
and that’s how you develop this cancer

00:15:55.387 --> 00:15:57.790
where the cell itself becomes the ego,

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:03.137
it gets the ego and it starts multiplying, multiplying.

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:09.449
So this virus can give you any kind of disease,

00:16:09.649 --> 00:16:12.441
which cannot be cured by medical science

00:16:12.641 --> 00:16:17.950
because medical science deals with the right side of the physical side.

00:16:18.921 --> 00:16:26.287
But the mental side is dealt with by Mahakali power, mental side.

00:16:29.325 --> 00:16:32.893
That is how in Sahaja Yoga we have been able to cure

00:16:33.094 --> 00:16:37.055
many incurable diseases.

00:16:38.444 --> 00:16:42.649
By using candles,

00:16:42.849 --> 00:16:49.275
because the light when it is shown to these viruses,

00:16:49.475 --> 00:16:53.801
or to the bhoots, they go away.

00:16:54.497 --> 00:16:56.734
So by three-candle treatment you can cure

00:16:56.934 --> 00:17:01.776
any one of these incurable diseases, even AIDS.

00:17:02.511 --> 00:17:09.266
But when this trouble starts above the Vishuddhi chakra

00:17:09.466 --> 00:17:11.703
or from the Vishuddhi chakra,

00:17:11.903 --> 00:17:14.655
then people become mentally handicapped,

00:17:14.855 --> 00:17:18.775
like they become mad, they get epilepsy

00:17:18.975 --> 00:17:25.125
or they get what we call schizophrenic.

00:17:27.059 --> 00:17:32.662
Now what they do when they do black magic, we should understand.

00:17:33.676 --> 00:17:36.826
In India we call it preta vidya, swarshana vidya.

00:17:37.026 --> 00:17:39.826
Preta vidya means the dead, knowledge of the dead

00:17:40.026 --> 00:17:47.006
and swarshana vidya is the knowledge of the cemetery.

00:17:47.207 --> 00:17:49.830
Sahaja Yogi: Preta vidya? Shri Mataji: Yes, preta vidya.

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:55.069
Sahaja Yogi: Preta also in Brazilian means black. In Brazilian, black.

00:17:55.269 --> 00:17:59.277
But “preta” means dead.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:06.170
And another is “Smashana vidya” means of the, of the cemetery.

00:18:09.094 --> 00:18:14.497
So the way they do it is that when some evil genius is dead,

00:18:14.697 --> 00:18:16.860
when they know that somebody is dead,

00:18:16.885 --> 00:18:19.542
then these people go there

00:18:19.742 --> 00:18:26.342
and try to wait until everybody disappears.

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:34.637
They burn in India, they burn the body in India

00:18:34.837 --> 00:18:40.282
and when the brain is opened it makes a sound.

00:18:40.483 --> 00:18:46.022
After that people go away. So, they are still there.

00:18:47.076 --> 00:18:51.362
And then they take the skull of that man,

00:18:51.562 --> 00:18:55.711
or some part of the body with them, maybe some bones,

00:18:55.911 --> 00:19:01.490
so that the spirit, which is hovering there, follows them.

00:19:01.534 --> 00:19:04.659
And then they give some names to these bhoots

00:19:04.859 --> 00:19:07.342
who are following them and then they, somehow or other,

00:19:07.542 --> 00:19:12.097
tie them up, you see, they imprison them.

00:19:13.241 --> 00:19:17.249
And then they use these bhoots to entice someone,

00:19:17.449 --> 00:19:21.195
to mesmerise someone.

00:19:21.975 --> 00:19:24.749
And these bhoots can get more bhoots also with them

00:19:24.949 --> 00:19:27.085
to entice them more if these people want,

00:19:27.285 --> 00:19:33.756
just because they are now captured and they are evil geniuses.

00:19:34.831 --> 00:19:37.219
So, this is what the false guru do, that

00:19:37.419 --> 00:19:41.657
they put these bhoots on people, mesmerise them.

00:19:41.858 --> 00:19:44.021
Through their eyes these bhoots come in

00:19:44.046 --> 00:19:46.685
and then these people start giving all their money,

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:49.121
all the property, everything to them,

00:19:49.321 --> 00:19:53.615
even the women give up their chastity.

00:19:59.048 --> 00:20:02.857
Anywhere.

00:20:24.817 --> 00:20:29.325
So, this is how they try to mesmerise.

00:20:30.208 --> 00:20:33.936
Also, they can use these bhoots for killing somebody

00:20:34.136 --> 00:20:38.507
or for beating somebody, putting somebody into trouble,

00:20:38.707 --> 00:20:42.652
all kinds of things.

00:20:43.979 --> 00:20:49.232
So also, they try to sort of put ideas into people,

00:20:49.432 --> 00:20:56.642
make them violent and make them very bad people, dirty people.

00:20:58.024 --> 00:21:02.293
This unnatural sex relationship, like homosexuality and all that.

00:21:02.494 --> 00:21:06.928
that is also from bhoots.

00:21:07.774 --> 00:21:14.631
That is, they do everything that is anti, you can say, Mahakali.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:19.639
And that is how they may bring inauspiciousness,

00:21:19.839 --> 00:21:25.897
unholiness, violence, all kinds of problems.

00:21:27.079 --> 00:21:31.172
Now supposing, if these bhoots are, say, drunkards,

00:21:31.372 --> 00:21:35.999
then they make people drink too much.

00:21:36.613 --> 00:21:41.798
Or if they are, say, cheats or people who have been making money

00:21:41.998 --> 00:21:46.973
by wrong methods, they can also enter into the heads of people.

00:21:47.173 --> 00:21:50.822
Like here I think the politicians, they have entered into their heads,

00:21:51.022 --> 00:21:55.323
so they are like mad people now.

00:21:56.294 --> 00:22:00.201
And this is how the dharma is not there anymore,

00:22:00.401 --> 00:22:04.518
there is no dharma, there are no maryadhas, nothing

00:22:04.718 --> 00:22:08.972
and they do what they like.

00:22:10.357 --> 00:22:13.434
So, the hundred and eight names of the Goddess

00:22:13.634 --> 00:22:19.640
or the one thousand names of the Goddess are mostly for Mahakali,

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:25.377
on the left-hand side, because she killed so many rakshasas.

00:22:26.729 --> 00:22:31.370
She destroys also viruses and all kinds of things

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:36.359
which are inflicted on human beings.

00:22:36.975 --> 00:22:40.947
Also, she cures many things like conditionings,

00:22:41.147 --> 00:22:45.774
say for example, of the Catholic church,

00:22:46.498 --> 00:22:50.298
which has given a conditioning into human beings

00:22:50.498 --> 00:22:56.480
that they cannot ascend, because of this Catholic church conditioning.

00:22:59.372 --> 00:23:03.451
So even if you believe in someone, supposing there is a Sahaja Yogi

00:23:03.651 --> 00:23:06.808
and you believe that this Sahaja Yogi is God,

00:23:07.008 --> 00:23:10.925
then you can catch also.

00:23:11.301 --> 00:23:25.069
Because if you believe in anybody who has no authority,

00:23:25.094 --> 00:23:30.761
it is unauthorised “shraddha” [faith], then you get into trouble.

00:23:32.457 --> 00:23:36.076
So, in Sahaja Yoga nobody should consider somebody as guru

00:23:36.277 --> 00:23:38.448
because he has given you Realization or something,

00:23:38.648 --> 00:23:42.472
he is not your guru.

00:23:44.037 --> 00:23:48.276
And the best way to get rid of it is through the Mother Earth

00:23:48.476 --> 00:23:51.312
because she sucks in, recedes the left side.

00:23:51.512 --> 00:23:55.111
The Mother Earth sucks in your problems.

00:23:56.690 --> 00:24:00.885
So, if you just put your left hand towards the light

00:24:01.085 --> 00:24:05.154
and your right hand on the Mother Earth, from the light, you see,

00:24:05.354 --> 00:24:10.274
negativity runs and goes into the Mother Earth.

00:24:11.727 --> 00:24:14.877
They use the same thing, like lemons they will use, you see,

00:24:15.077 --> 00:24:17.313
in the lemon they will put bhoots

00:24:17.513 --> 00:24:19.885
and they put this lemon to somebody

00:24:20.085 --> 00:24:24.125
so that, that person gets possessed.

00:24:25.287 --> 00:24:28.969
While we remove the lemon that absorbs the bhoots

00:24:29.169 --> 00:24:31.796
and then put the lemon in the water.

00:24:33.318 --> 00:24:35.753
Then another thing, there is the light, you see.

00:24:35.778 --> 00:24:39.467
Supposing you put the light without Me being there,

00:24:39.667 --> 00:24:43.242
my photograph not being there, then the bhoots start,

00:24:43.442 --> 00:24:47.942
you see, getting more upset with the light.

00:24:48.768 --> 00:24:53.546
And it attracts more bhoots to protect itself.

00:24:55.072 --> 00:25:00.302
But in the presence of my photograph, the photograph emits vibrations

00:25:00.502 --> 00:25:05.612
which make all the bhoots run away.

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:12.403
Because the light also, this light, gets awakened

00:25:12.603 --> 00:25:16.976
in front of my photograph.

00:25:18.351 --> 00:25:25.849
So, this is the contrast in which we can achieve

00:25:26.049 --> 00:25:31.034
results of getting rid of problems.

00:25:31.868 --> 00:25:34.083
But I would suggest that Sahaja Yogis

00:25:34.283 --> 00:25:38.860
should not directly treat these people.

00:25:39.884 --> 00:25:42.431
They can put them before my photograph

00:25:42.632 --> 00:25:47.697
and use the three candles treatment but not touch.

00:25:49.115 --> 00:25:54.883
Before doing anything, they should take a bandhan also.

00:25:55.997 --> 00:25:58.020
So, whenever you take your bandhan,

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:01.926
you are taking the bandhan of Mahakali,

00:26:03.302 --> 00:26:07.380
because she protects you.

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:13.076
After some time, when you have reached a certain stage of ascent,

00:26:13.285 --> 00:26:17.897
the bhoots run away, if they see you, they run away.

00:26:19.596 --> 00:26:24.608
Or they will start shaking before you.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:29.189
And ask such a person to put his hands towards the light

00:26:29.389 --> 00:26:32.818
with my photograph. The light will go up and down

00:26:33.018 --> 00:26:37.415
and black soot will come out.

00:26:41.171 --> 00:26:46.558
So, the left side is called as Tamo guna, the right side is Rajo guna

00:26:46.758 --> 00:26:50.859
and the centre as Satwo guna.

00:26:52.452 --> 00:27:00.452
Now, Tamo guna means a left-sided personality.

00:27:02.078 --> 00:27:07.179
He is the one who always runs into some darkness

00:27:07.379 --> 00:27:10.115
and he’s secretive and he’s sly

00:27:10.316 --> 00:27:14.863
and you don’t know how he-what he’s [inaudible].

00:27:15.108 --> 00:27:19.409
And to look at, he looks very humble

00:27:19.609 --> 00:27:25.054
and he never answers you back but he does everything at your back.

00:27:27.185 --> 00:27:32.256
You cannot make out his mischiefs till he may hurt you.

00:27:32.935 --> 00:27:37.203
Now, a right-sided person is on the contrary extremely aggressive

00:27:37.403 --> 00:27:43.083
and sort of tries to show off.

00:27:44.707 --> 00:27:48.882
But the Satwo guna is in the balance.

00:27:49.316 --> 00:27:52.029
But on your vibrations, you can make it out

00:27:52.229 --> 00:27:56.387
what are the problems of the person.

00:27:57.105 --> 00:28:02.748
Last night, for example, my whole Swadishthana was burning.

00:28:04.183 --> 00:28:08.855
Even the children will show by putting their thumb in the mouth.

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:13.562
So, this is what is the left Swadishthana and for left Swadishthana,

00:28:13.762 --> 00:28:16.966
the mantra is Mahakali’s mantra and another

00:28:17.166 --> 00:28:22.288
very important mantra for left Swadishthana is that,

00:28:22.488 --> 00:28:27.092
“Mother, you are the pure knowledge”.

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:30.696
But for Christians it is better even to say,

00:28:30.896 --> 00:28:36.155
“Mother you are the Holy Ghost", like Christ has said.

00:28:37.777 --> 00:28:42.640
It is really easy to get rid of these things if you just decide that

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:47.182
“I’m not having anything to do with that.”

00:28:48.784 --> 00:28:51.194
And these bhoots are so stupid, that,

00:28:51.394 --> 00:28:53.592
supposing someone may come to my house,

00:28:53.793 --> 00:28:56.980
take off their coat, put some other shawl on them,

00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:01.391
when they go, the bhoots can’t recognize them.

00:29:01.416 --> 00:29:04.265
- They are so stupid. - The bhoots that are in the shawl?

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:07.090
No, no, no, somebody comes to meet Me.

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:10.018
And I take out the bhoots, you see, he’ll go out somewhere.

00:29:10.218 --> 00:29:12.322
The bhoots come inside the house also.

00:29:12.347 --> 00:29:14.787
Then you make him wear something else

00:29:14.987 --> 00:29:19.170
so the person changes his dress. So, they can’t make you out.

00:29:19.371 --> 00:29:23.574
They are so stupid.

00:29:24.087 --> 00:29:30.118
Just come here because there’s sumn there, both of you.

00:29:32.337 --> 00:29:34.566
So, this is Mahakali’s great work

00:29:34.766 --> 00:29:37.518
and I have already told you how she works it out.

00:29:37.718 --> 00:29:39.883
Now today we are going to worship her,

00:29:40.083 --> 00:29:43.195
I’m sure She will become very powerful here

00:29:43.395 --> 00:29:48.943
and She will see to it that all this black magic is finished.

00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:54.064
These Mahakali’s powers you will start seeing

00:29:54.264 --> 00:29:59.349
and when she starts manifesting, your politicians will improve,

00:29:59.549 --> 00:30:04.587
everything will improve, because it is under these wrong powers

00:30:04.778 --> 00:30:08.845
you see that they are doing these things.

00:30:09.822 --> 00:30:12.718
Also all these bad things like violence and

00:30:12.918 --> 00:30:15.829
all kinds of bad things people do

00:30:16.029 --> 00:30:21.003
is only under the influence of negativity.

00:30:22.324 --> 00:30:25.062
Even if they know this is wrong, it should not be done,

00:30:25.262 --> 00:30:29.714
they do it compulsively, compulsively.

00:30:30.823 --> 00:30:34.311
Now a new disease has come where people have compulsive habits,

00:30:34.511 --> 00:30:39.132
like washing their hands all the time, or

00:30:39.332 --> 00:30:42.462
I mean all these compulsive habits are done

00:30:42.662 --> 00:30:46.677
like somebody’s brushing their teeth three hundred times,

00:30:46.877 --> 00:30:51.105
somebody washing their hands, somebody very particular about everything,

00:30:51.305 --> 00:30:55.896
all the time cleaning, cleaning.

00:30:57.733 --> 00:31:01.811
Some women are like that, if anything falls off, they must run, clean,

00:31:02.011 --> 00:31:06.616
and they have no time to sit down for five minutes.

00:31:07.342 --> 00:31:12.416
They can’t help it, they can’t help it.

00:31:13.385 --> 00:31:18.686
Ultimately they get out of society because they are absolutely useless.

00:31:19.727 --> 00:31:24.852
So, I have now tried to tell you the various things that

00:31:25.052 --> 00:31:31.301
this absence of Mahakali can manifest.

00:31:32.731 --> 00:31:37.285
So, the Mahakali’s manifestation is so important for a country

00:31:37.485 --> 00:31:42.382
where there are so many negativities.

00:31:44.256 --> 00:31:47.599
And I hope next time I come, this will be very much reduced

00:31:47.799 --> 00:31:54.354
and worked out, we’ll have a much cleaner place.

00:31:56.439 --> 00:32:00.097
Now you people also now know how to cure left Swadishthana.

00:32:00.297 --> 00:32:06.051
Always check up the left Swadishthana and try to cure it.

00:32:08.478 --> 00:32:13.987
May God bless you all.

00:32:20.653 --> 00:32:24.177
- Can you get some children? - Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:32:31.737 --> 00:32:36.364
And Ganesha is most important for Mahakali.
