05:51.887 --> 06:00.468
Shri Mahakali Puja, Salvador-Bahia (Brazil), 14 October 1992.

06:04.173 --> 06:13.387
It is so nice to be here in Brazil in Salvador.

06:16.513 --> 06:19.458
I met one gentleman a long time back,

06:19.658 --> 06:24.617
from my husband’s office, from Brazil,

06:24.817 --> 06:30.390
and his wife was suffering from terrible black magic.

06:31.645 --> 06:35.216
And she really was cured of that trouble.

06:35.403 --> 06:39.274
So he told me that, you have to go to Brazil

06:39.474 --> 06:42.415
because it is full of lots of negative things

06:42.615 --> 06:47.337
specially the black magic, so you must go there somehow.

06:48.231 --> 06:50.683
And so it was my great desire to come here

06:50.883 --> 06:54.321
and that’s how I came, few years back.

06:54.488 --> 06:58.082
Also Duilio was here and, I mean, things were arranged

06:58.282 --> 07:02.409
somehow, Sahaj, so I came here.

07:03.171 --> 07:11.359
So the problem of this country is more, is this black magic

07:11.559 --> 07:15.869
that is brought by the people from Africa.

07:18.733 --> 07:23.458
So I have thought today, we, let us have Mahakali Puja.

07:27.429 --> 07:33.251
Mahakali is the left side power in us.

07:34.991 --> 07:39.936
So, actually She is Adi Shakti.

07:40.428 --> 07:43.751
Only when she enters into the left side of the Virata

07:43.959 --> 07:50.419
we call her Mahakali, but she is the power of pure desire of God.

07:51.457 --> 07:56.433
Then She establishes Shri Ganesha herself.

07:59.113 --> 08:03.788
Then she goes to the right side as Mahasaraswati,

08:04.441 --> 08:11.742
and then she enters into the centre where she is Mahalakshmi.

08:12.426 --> 08:17.829
That is how Adi Shakti takes three forms.

08:18.652 --> 08:22.220
But Mahakali is the pure form,

08:22.420 --> 08:25.085
because she’s not yet deep in,

08:25.285 --> 08:30.150
I mean, from Adi Shakti, she’s Mahakali.

08:30.730 --> 08:35.162
So first thing She, before creating this universe or anything,

08:35.362 --> 08:38.854
She created Shri Ganesha.

08:40.098 --> 08:46.144
And first to spread, manifest

08:46.344 --> 08:54.524
not only holiness but also auspiciousness, and purity.

08:55.705 --> 08:58.671
So before anything was created,

08:58.871 --> 09:01.354
these spiritual forces were created,

09:01.554 --> 09:06.072
to protect the creation that was to follow.

09:06.193 --> 09:11.700
So this Mahakali force was specially in the purest form

09:11.900 --> 09:17.175
to protect people from the negative side.

09:20.248 --> 09:25.265
Now when any thought enters our mind,

09:25.465 --> 09:31.893
any reasoning concept of our mind,

09:32.094 --> 09:36.871
it is thrown on the left side by this Mahakali.

09:37.072 --> 09:41.512
- Throw out? - Goes to the left side. Subconscious.

09:41.712 --> 09:45.441
- Every bad thought ? No. - See whatever thought comes to us.

09:45.641 --> 09:51.632
Today is the support now, just now, that goes to the left side, has.

09:51.780 --> 09:56.572
And then that is how the present becomes the past,

09:56.772 --> 10:00.590
goes to the subconscious.

10:03.103 --> 10:06.126
Now the subconscious also has many layers

10:06.326 --> 10:11.761
which are on the left side in a parallel way,

10:11.786 --> 10:16.286
not horizontally, but parallel.

10:16.598 --> 10:19.527
There are seven of these layers,

10:19.727 --> 10:27.124
and the seventh one ends up into the Collective Subconscious.

10:28.530 --> 10:31.256
So whatever is dead, in the past,

10:31.456 --> 10:36.192
and was discarded from the evolutionary process,

10:36.392 --> 10:40.819
is thrown into the Collective Subconscious.

10:42.344 --> 10:46.350
Now when –

10:46.550 --> 10:52.428
say for example, lives which were thrown out of the evolution,

10:52.628 --> 10:57.142
microscopic animals, whatever, viruses,

10:57.342 --> 10:59.699
then also human beings, animals,

10:59.899 --> 11:03.770
everything that was thrown, like mammoths and all that,

11:03.970 --> 11:09.291
these animals were thrown out of the evolution, are.

11:11.460 --> 11:16.807
So the people who are living more in the past,

11:17.007 --> 11:26.610
if by any accident or by any unhappy incident in life,

11:26.810 --> 11:31.358
are thrown towards that, they catch

11:31.558 --> 11:37.177
some of this Collective Subconscious.

11:39.869 --> 11:45.418
So also, this lifetime, whatever conditionings we have,

11:45.618 --> 11:54.467
also pass into our, they pass into our subconscious mind.

11:59.031 --> 12:07.300
For example, a person is sitting in the darkness alone,

12:07.500 --> 12:10.945
suddenly starts feeling the fear.

12:11.145 --> 12:16.286
Then he is, with that fear, he’s thrown towards the left side

12:16.486 --> 12:20.745
and he can catch something, what we call as ‘bhoots’, you see,

12:20.945 --> 12:24.515
what we call bhoots is some sort of a dead spirit

12:24.715 --> 12:28.947
and then he becomes a different person.

12:28.994 --> 12:32.406
Also, somebody who is too much right-sided, is always active,

12:32.622 --> 12:37.288
thinking too much of the future,

12:38.332 --> 12:44.308
his attention moves to the extreme, say, to the right side.

12:44.982 --> 12:50.201
Then suddenly if some shock or some fear, or whatever it is,

12:50.401 --> 12:56.227
this pendulum like thing, can move to the other side also.

12:57.298 --> 12:59.941
So all the people who are very right-sided

13:00.141 --> 13:05.441
can get into problems of possessions

13:05.641 --> 13:07.672
Sahaja Yogi : Of subconscious?
Shri Mataji : Of possessions.

13:07.873 --> 13:11.807
Sahaja Yogi : But, of subconscious?
Shri Mataji : Subconscious also.

13:12.574 --> 13:21.425
Also people who are extremely meticulous, extremely futuristic,

13:21.625 --> 13:26.642
can catch on the right side also Collective Supraconscious.

13:26.788 --> 13:34.267
Shri Mataji corrects him : Supraconcious.. Right side, it’s the right side. Futuristic.

13:36.109 --> 13:41.855
Now the - We have to now understand MahaKali’s powers.

13:43.222 --> 13:48.007
We have to understnd now Mahakali's Powers.

13:50.658 --> 13:58.901
Now MahaKali’s powers are such that She is the Holy Ghost.

14:00.578 --> 14:08.976
So firstly She can cure any diseases that come from viruses,

14:09.765 --> 14:13.096
like say from AIDS. You can start from Mooladhara up,

14:13.296 --> 14:17.477
all Mooladhara diseases, then all Swadisthana diseases,

14:17.677 --> 14:20.749
all these diseases.

14:20.770 --> 14:24.208
Left Vishuddhi of course, is a combination,

14:24.408 --> 14:29.732
because when a man is too right-sided to balance his ego

14:29.932 --> 14:34.187
he puts it here in the guilt.

14:35.485 --> 14:41.949
So it could be a combination of both right and left.

14:42.264 --> 14:47.216
But all other incurable diseases are left-sided.

14:48.294 --> 14:52.994
Like you have cancer.

14:53.882 --> 14:56.395
Now see this is the left side centre

14:56.595 --> 15:01.089
and this is the right side centre, they look like this.

15:02.039 --> 15:04.197
So this is left side, this is right side

15:04.398 --> 15:08.332
and in the centre is the centre.

15:08.554 --> 15:12.555
Now supposing even if you have a thing of the right side, too much,

15:12.756 --> 15:17.330
the energy is driven to the right side.

15:18.192 --> 15:21.659
But suddenly something may happen, you see, some accident,

15:21.859 --> 15:26.447
some sort of unhappiness and this little bit can break like that,

15:26.647 --> 15:30.044
from the left side.

15:30.747 --> 15:36.787
So the virus can start flowing into the right side also.

15:37.175 --> 15:40.898
Now when this virus enters into the right side

15:41.099 --> 15:45.651
you have no connection with the whole, because it’s broken now.

15:46.074 --> 15:49.874
So this right side starts working on its own

15:50.074 --> 15:55.187
and that’s how you develop this cancer

15:55.387 --> 15:57.790
where the cell itself becomes the ego,

15:57.990 --> 16:03.137
it gets the ego and it starts multiplying, multiplying.

16:04.450 --> 16:09.449
So this virus can give you any kind of disease,

16:09.649 --> 16:12.441
which cannot be cured by medical science

16:12.641 --> 16:17.950
because medical science deals with the right side of the physical side.

16:18.921 --> 16:26.287
But the mental side is dealt with by Mahakali power, mental side.

16:29.325 --> 16:32.893
That is how in Sahaja Yoga we have been able to cure

16:33.094 --> 16:37.055
many incurable diseases.

16:38.444 --> 16:42.649
By using candles,

16:42.849 --> 16:49.275
because the light when it is shown to these viruses,

16:49.475 --> 16:53.801
or to the bhoots, they go away.

16:54.497 --> 16:56.734
So by three-candle treatment you can cure

16:56.934 --> 17:01.776
any one of these incurable diseases, even AIDS.

17:02.511 --> 17:09.266
But when this trouble starts above the Vishuddhi chakra

17:09.466 --> 17:11.703
or from the Vishuddhi chakra,

17:11.903 --> 17:14.655
then people become mentally handicapped,

17:14.855 --> 17:18.775
like they become mad, they get epilepsy

17:18.975 --> 17:25.125
or they get what we call schizophrenic.

17:27.059 --> 17:32.662
Now what they do when they do black magic, we should understand.

17:33.676 --> 17:36.826
In India we call it preta vidya, swarshana vidya.

17:37.026 --> 17:39.826
Preta vidya means the dead, knowledge of the dead

17:40.026 --> 17:47.006
and swarshana vidya is the knowledge of the cemetery.

17:47.207 --> 17:49.830
Sahaja Yogi: Preta vidya? Shri Mataji: Yes, preta vidya.

17:50.030 --> 17:55.069
Sahaja Yogi: Preta also in Brazilian means black. In Brazilian, black.

17:55.269 --> 17:59.277
But “preta” means dead.

18:00.400 --> 18:06.170
And another is “Smashana vidya” means of the, of the cemetery.

18:09.094 --> 18:14.497
So the way they do it is that when some evil genius is dead,

18:14.697 --> 18:16.860
when they know that somebody is dead,

18:16.885 --> 18:19.542
then these people go there

18:19.742 --> 18:26.342
and try to wait until everybody disappears.

18:31.170 --> 18:34.637
They burn in India, they burn the body in India

18:34.837 --> 18:40.282
and when the brain is opened it makes a sound.

18:40.483 --> 18:46.022
After that people go away. So, they are still there.

18:47.076 --> 18:51.362
And then they take the skull of that man,

18:51.562 --> 18:55.711
or some part of the body with them, maybe some bones,

18:55.911 --> 19:01.490
so that the spirit, which is hovering there, follows them.

19:01.534 --> 19:04.659
And then they give some names to these bhoots

19:04.859 --> 19:07.342
who are following them and then they, somehow or other,

19:07.542 --> 19:12.097
tie them up, you see, they imprison them.

19:13.241 --> 19:17.249
And then they use these bhoots to entice someone,

19:17.449 --> 19:21.195
to mesmerise someone.

19:21.975 --> 19:24.749
And these bhoots can get more bhoots also with them

19:24.949 --> 19:27.085
to entice them more if these people want,

19:27.285 --> 19:33.756
just because they are now captured and they are evil geniuses.

19:34.831 --> 19:37.219
So, this is what the false guru do, that

19:37.419 --> 19:41.657
they put these bhoots on people, mesmerise them.

19:41.858 --> 19:44.021
Through their eyes these bhoots come in

19:44.046 --> 19:46.685
and then these people start giving all their money,

19:46.710 --> 19:49.121
all the property, everything to them,

19:49.321 --> 19:53.615
even the women give up their chastity.

19:59.048 --> 20:02.857
Anywhere.

20:24.817 --> 20:29.325
So, this is how they try to mesmerise.

20:30.208 --> 20:33.936
Also, they can use these bhoots for killing somebody

20:34.136 --> 20:38.507
or for beating somebody, putting somebody into trouble,

20:38.707 --> 20:42.652
all kinds of things.

20:43.979 --> 20:49.232
So also, they try to sort of put ideas into people,

20:49.432 --> 20:56.642
make them violent and make them very bad people, dirty people.

20:58.024 --> 21:02.293
This unnatural sex relationship, like homosexuality and all that.

21:02.494 --> 21:06.928
that is also from bhoots.

21:07.774 --> 21:14.631
That is, they do everything that is anti, you can say, Mahakali.

21:15.680 --> 21:19.639
And that is how they may bring inauspiciousness,

21:19.839 --> 21:25.897
unholiness, violence, all kinds of problems.

21:27.079 --> 21:31.172
Now supposing, if these bhoots are, say, drunkards,

21:31.372 --> 21:35.999
then they make people drink too much.

21:36.613 --> 21:41.798
Or if they are, say, cheats or people who have been making money

21:41.998 --> 21:46.973
by wrong methods, they can also enter into the heads of people.

21:47.173 --> 21:50.822
Like here I think the politicians, they have entered into their heads,

21:51.022 --> 21:55.323
so they are like mad people now.

21:56.294 --> 22:00.201
And this is how the dharma is not there anymore,

22:00.401 --> 22:04.518
there is no dharma, there are no maryadhas, nothing

22:04.718 --> 22:08.972
and they do what they like.

22:10.357 --> 22:13.434
So, the hundred and eight names of the Goddess

22:13.634 --> 22:19.640
or the one thousand names of the Goddess are mostly for Mahakali,

22:19.840 --> 22:25.377
on the left-hand side, because she killed so many rakshasas.

22:26.729 --> 22:31.370
She destroys also viruses and all kinds of things

22:31.570 --> 22:36.359
which are inflicted on human beings.

22:36.975 --> 22:40.947
Also, she cures many things like conditionings,

22:41.147 --> 22:45.774
say for example, of the Catholic church,

22:46.498 --> 22:50.298
which has given a conditioning into human beings

22:50.498 --> 22:56.480
that they cannot ascend, because of this Catholic church conditioning.

22:59.372 --> 23:03.451
So even if you believe in someone, supposing there is a Sahaja Yogi

23:03.651 --> 23:06.808
and you believe that this Sahaja Yogi is God,

23:07.008 --> 23:10.925
then you can catch also.

23:11.301 --> 23:25.069
Because if you believe in anybody who has no authority,

23:25.094 --> 23:30.761
it is unauthorised “shraddha” [faith], then you get into trouble.

23:32.457 --> 23:36.076
So, in Sahaja Yoga nobody should consider somebody as guru

23:36.277 --> 23:38.448
because he has given you Realization or something,

23:38.648 --> 23:42.472
he is not your guru.

23:44.037 --> 23:48.276
And the best way to get rid of it is through the Mother Earth

23:48.476 --> 23:51.312
because she sucks in, recedes the left side.

23:51.512 --> 23:55.111
The Mother Earth sucks in your problems.

23:56.690 --> 24:00.885
So, if you just put your left hand towards the light

24:01.085 --> 24:05.154
and your right hand on the Mother Earth, from the light, you see,

24:05.354 --> 24:10.274
negativity runs and goes into the Mother Earth.

24:11.727 --> 24:14.877
They use the same thing, like lemons they will use, you see,

24:15.077 --> 24:17.313
in the lemon they will put bhoots

24:17.513 --> 24:19.885
and they put this lemon to somebody

24:20.085 --> 24:24.125
so that, that person gets possessed.

24:25.287 --> 24:28.969
While we remove the lemon that absorbs the bhoots

24:29.169 --> 24:31.796
and then put the lemon in the water.

24:33.318 --> 24:35.753
Then another thing, there is the light, you see.

24:35.778 --> 24:39.467
Supposing you put the light without Me being there,

24:39.667 --> 24:43.242
my photograph not being there, then the bhoots start,

24:43.442 --> 24:47.942
you see, getting more upset with the light.

24:48.768 --> 24:53.546
And it attracts more bhoots to protect itself.

24:55.072 --> 25:00.302
But in the presence of my photograph, the photograph emits vibrations

25:00.502 --> 25:05.612
which make all the bhoots run away.

25:07.110 --> 25:12.403
Because the light also, this light, gets awakened

25:12.603 --> 25:16.976
in front of my photograph.

25:18.351 --> 25:25.849
So, this is the contrast in which we can achieve

25:26.049 --> 25:31.034
results of getting rid of problems.

25:31.868 --> 25:34.083
But I would suggest that Sahaja Yogis

25:34.283 --> 25:38.860
should not directly treat these people.

25:39.884 --> 25:42.431
They can put them before my photograph

25:42.632 --> 25:47.697
and use the three candles treatment but not touch.

25:49.115 --> 25:54.883
Before doing anything, they should take a bandhan also.

25:55.997 --> 25:58.020
So, whenever you take your bandhan,

25:58.220 --> 26:01.926
you are taking the bandhan of Mahakali,

26:03.302 --> 26:07.380
because she protects you.

26:07.580 --> 26:13.076
After some time, when you have reached a certain stage of ascent,

26:13.285 --> 26:17.897
the bhoots run away, if they see you, they run away.

26:19.596 --> 26:24.608
Or they will start shaking before you.

26:26.040 --> 26:29.189
And ask such a person to put his hands towards the light

26:29.389 --> 26:32.818
with my photograph. The light will go up and down

26:33.018 --> 26:37.415
and black soot will come out.

26:41.171 --> 26:46.558
So, the left side is called as Tamo guna, the right side is Rajo guna

26:46.758 --> 26:50.859
and the centre as Satwo guna.

26:52.452 --> 27:00.452
Now, Tamo guna means a left-sided personality.

27:02.078 --> 27:07.179
He is the one who always runs into some darkness

27:07.379 --> 27:10.115
and he’s secretive and he’s sly

27:10.316 --> 27:14.863
and you don’t know how he-what he’s [inaudible].

27:15.108 --> 27:19.409
And to look at, he looks very humble

27:19.609 --> 27:25.054
and he never answers you back but he does everything at your back.

27:27.185 --> 27:32.256
You cannot make out his mischiefs till he may hurt you.

27:32.935 --> 27:37.203
Now, a right-sided person is on the contrary extremely aggressive

27:37.403 --> 27:43.083
and sort of tries to show off.

27:44.707 --> 27:48.882
But the Satwo guna is in the balance.

27:49.316 --> 27:52.029
But on your vibrations, you can make it out

27:52.229 --> 27:56.387
what are the problems of the person.

27:57.105 --> 28:02.748
Last night, for example, my whole Swadishthana was burning.

28:04.183 --> 28:08.855
Even the children will show by putting their thumb in the mouth.

28:09.730 --> 28:13.562
So, this is what is the left Swadishthana and for left Swadishthana,

28:13.762 --> 28:16.966
the mantra is Mahakali’s mantra and another

28:17.166 --> 28:22.288
very important mantra for left Swadishthana is that,

28:22.488 --> 28:27.092
“Mother, you are the pure knowledge”.

28:28.190 --> 28:30.696
But for Christians it is better even to say,

28:30.896 --> 28:36.155
“Mother you are the Holy Ghost", like Christ has said.

28:37.777 --> 28:42.640
It is really easy to get rid of these things if you just decide that

28:42.840 --> 28:47.182
“I’m not having anything to do with that.”

28:48.784 --> 28:51.194
And these bhoots are so stupid, that,

28:51.394 --> 28:53.592
supposing someone may come to my house,

28:53.793 --> 28:56.980
take off their coat, put some other shawl on them,

28:57.180 --> 29:01.391
when they go, the bhoots can’t recognize them.

29:01.416 --> 29:04.265
- They are so stupid. - The bhoots that are in the shawl?

29:04.290 --> 29:07.090
No, no, no, somebody comes to meet Me.

29:07.290 --> 29:10.018
And I take out the bhoots, you see, he’ll go out somewhere.

29:10.218 --> 29:12.322
The bhoots come inside the house also.

29:12.347 --> 29:14.787
Then you make him wear something else

29:14.987 --> 29:19.170
so the person changes his dress. So, they can’t make you out.

29:19.371 --> 29:23.574
They are so stupid.

29:24.087 --> 29:30.118
Just come here because there’s sumn there, both of you.

29:32.337 --> 29:34.566
So, this is Mahakali’s great work

29:34.766 --> 29:37.518
and I have already told you how she works it out.

29:37.718 --> 29:39.883
Now today we are going to worship her,

29:40.083 --> 29:43.195
I’m sure She will become very powerful here

29:43.395 --> 29:48.943
and She will see to it that all this black magic is finished.

29:51.050 --> 29:54.064
These Mahakali’s powers you will start seeing

29:54.264 --> 29:59.349
and when she starts manifesting, your politicians will improve,

29:59.549 --> 30:04.587
everything will improve, because it is under these wrong powers

30:04.778 --> 30:08.845
you see that they are doing these things.

30:09.822 --> 30:12.718
Also all these bad things like violence and

30:12.918 --> 30:15.829
all kinds of bad things people do

30:16.029 --> 30:21.003
is only under the influence of negativity.

30:22.324 --> 30:25.062
Even if they know this is wrong, it should not be done,

30:25.262 --> 30:29.714
they do it compulsively, compulsively.

30:30.823 --> 30:34.311
Now a new disease has come where people have compulsive habits,

30:34.511 --> 30:39.132
like washing their hands all the time, or

30:39.332 --> 30:42.462
I mean all these compulsive habits are done

30:42.662 --> 30:46.677
like somebody’s brushing their teeth three hundred times,

30:46.877 --> 30:51.105
somebody washing their hands, somebody very particular about everything,

30:51.305 --> 30:55.896
all the time cleaning, cleaning.

30:57.733 --> 31:01.811
Some women are like that, if anything falls off, they must run, clean,

31:02.011 --> 31:06.616
and they have no time to sit down for five minutes.

31:07.342 --> 31:12.416
They can’t help it, they can’t help it.

31:13.385 --> 31:18.686
Ultimately they get out of society because they are absolutely useless.

31:19.727 --> 31:24.852
So, I have now tried to tell you the various things that

31:25.052 --> 31:31.301
this absence of Mahakali can manifest.

31:32.731 --> 31:37.285
So, the Mahakali’s manifestation is so important for a country

31:37.485 --> 31:42.382
where there are so many negativities.

31:44.256 --> 31:47.599
And I hope next time I come, this will be very much reduced

31:47.799 --> 31:54.354
and worked out, we’ll have a much cleaner place.

31:56.439 --> 32:00.097
Now you people also now know how to cure left Swadishthana.

32:00.297 --> 32:06.051
Always check up the left Swadishthana and try to cure it.

32:08.478 --> 32:13.987
May God bless you all.

32:20.653 --> 32:24.177
- Can you get some children? - Yes, Shri Mataji.

32:31.737 --> 32:36.364
And Ganesha is most important for Mahakali.
