1
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:45,630
I bow to all the seekers of truth. It was
tremendous joy for me to come to this beautiful

2
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:57,430
Island that nature has created for our pleasure
and happiness. We have to think about, God

3
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:10,860
has done so much, such beautiful things for
us and what have we done for him? Can we do

4
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:23,030
something for him? He is all powerful, all
knowing. What can we do for Him? What can

5
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:38,400
we praise Him? He’s glory personified, his
beauty, his compassion! Only thing that we

6
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:49,600
can do is to know him and to know God, is
important that we should seek him. If we seek

7
00:24:49,600 --> 00:25:01,400
Him, what do we do? Again the problem is what
do we do to seek Him. We don’t have to do

8
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:09,420
anything about it, as God has created this
beautiful Island, all the beautiful things

9
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:18,280
of the world, he has created you as beautiful
people. All human beings are created with

10
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:25,830
great delicate, compassionate attention of
the Divine. You are not just created out of

11
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:34,640
the blue, but with very great, great understanding,
you are a special category of human beings

12
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:45,950
God has created. And what he wants you to
know Him, that’s all. And to know Him what

13
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:53,550
should we do? Now for example I’m standing
before you, you see me standing before you.

14
00:25:53,550 --> 00:26:00,310
Whatever Warren has told you about me, you
know something. You know me because you can

15
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:12,560
see me in person here, but to know God what
do we have to do, is that our central nervous

16
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:20,230
system itself, our awareness itself, our attention
itself is to be enlightened.

17
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:32,060
Let us not be persuaded by people who claim
that they know God. They use God as a means,

18
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:41,280
an instrument to build up and organise something.
How can it organise God, you cannot organise

19
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:49,640
God. He may organise you but you cannot organise
Him. It’s a very ego, sort of an idea, that

20
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:57,120
we are organising this organisation that organisation.
Sahaja Yoga has no organisation as such. We

21
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:03,410
have no president, we have nothing, it’s
just a thing that it should happen to you,

22
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:12,260
that you should become. It’s like a seed
sprouting, it’s a living process, it’s

23
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:21,840
a living process of the living God. Living
process, you cannot put any effort. If you

24
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:28,400
have to say to sprout a seed what effort can
you put in? If you have to transform a flower

25
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:35,810
into fruit what efforts can you put in? It’s
just built in and it works out but it shows

26
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:42,620
results. It is not that a seed will say I’m
the tree, it becomes a tree, does it? By professing

27
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:48,900
something, if the flower says I’m the fruit,
does it become a fruit? It does not! It has

28
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:56,050
to become! Becoming is the point we must remember.
If you are truthful, honest and if you are

29
00:27:56,050 --> 00:28:02,240
seekers we must know that for our benefit
we have to become! It’s no use belonging

30
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:09,550
to anything, no use professing anything, is
all nonsense because it will give you a false

31
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:15,970
notion about yourself. But reality will be
when you will feel it on your central nervous

32
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:20,180
system.
Unless and until you feel it on your central

33
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:24,220
nervous system, you should not even accept
me or no one. Why should you accept me? There

34
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:32,910
is no need! As long as you know that you have
to become something higher. Christ has said

35
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:38,340
very clearly, He said to Nichodemus, “I
say you are to be born again”. Now supposing

36
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:43,430
Nichodemus has taken a word I am born again
and put a certificate, self-certified born

37
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:52,180
again going around, and then fighting and
arguing and being violent. Is this the way?

38
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:57,930
It’s just a falsehood. You cannot just say,
if I say I am the Mayor of this place, do

39
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:04,360
I become? Every day to day life you know that
the authority has to be bestowed upon you.

40
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:12,020
In the same way if you do not become you are
just professing one of the nonsenses which

41
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:19,400
our forefathers have done and they, everybody
has done in this world. Have you become something?

42
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:24,810
The time has come, now the time is there,
this is the special time when you can become.

43
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:31,440
At this time, those people who just cling
onto things which have given them nothing

44
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:37,470
but an ego pampering, must realise that it
is high time that you come to reality and

45
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:43,470
understand that you have to know it on your
central nervous system as you know me standing

46
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:48,630
here.
If the central nervous system doesn’t give

47
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:54,720
you any indication then you should not accept
it. That’s one of the conditions of the

48
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:02,100
truth – that truth is known on the central
nervous system. Projection, one can do anything,

49
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:07,520
I can say I’m this and that and that, I
can talk this and that and that… so what?

50
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:14,250
It’s all my projection, are you to believe?
Supposing I say I have found something great

51
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:20,080
and this is it and if I have a good brain
I can put up a big show before you, so must

52
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:27,910
you believe it? I can put on some horns and
come before you and say those horns are the

53
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:39,350
special ones that God has given me, are you
to believe? You have to believe when you know.

54
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:44,130
For this God has made us so beautifully, that’s
what I wanted to show you, the chart (Image

55
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:49,370
of Virata on last page), how you are made.
Now in the bible there is a mention of the

56
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:54,740
word Holy Ghost. I asked a priest, I said
do you know what is the Holy Ghost is, he

57
00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:00,020
said I’m agnostic. I said you are agnostic,
how are you a priest? What are you doing about

58
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:07,930
it? He said I’m doing my job. I said job,
is this a job you can do? It’s not a job,

59
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:18,250
you cannot do a job with God, you have to
know Him, and to know him there is an arrangement

60
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:23,840
already made within you. The one who is our
creator, who has created all this beautiful

61
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:32,660
place, do you think He would not have made
us that way that we should know him? He is

62
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:39,030
more worried about his creation and the beauty
of that creation is expressed in human beings,

63
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:43,000
that they should know him. If that is the
purpose of His creation don’t you think

64
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:50,860
that he must have made some arrangements within
us for that? He must have done.

65
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:57,550
For example when I landed here on the pier
(Ryde) it was written if you want to see this

66
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:02,150
place you better go here, better go there,
there’s a church you can see, you can see

67
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:09,760
this place. All organised arranged you see.
As soon as you come in there is a train for

68
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:16,180
you, as you walk into the ferry there’s
another way of getting out from here and getting

69
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:22,180
another train, it’s just ready everything
arranged. If human beings can arrange so well

70
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:27,260
what about God Almighty? He must have done
something special within us!

71
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:33,410
Now here there are two doctors one of them
is Dr. Warren who talked to me and there is

72
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:38,080
another Dr. Bogdhan, but both of them are
here and I’ll show you what is the subtle

73
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,410
side within us, how God has made us. In short
you can have a look at yourself (refer to

74
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:49,980
chart). Now when I say all this you are also
not to believe that… blindfolded. No use

75
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:55,670
believing in to it blindfolded, you can see
for yourself if it works out or not. I cannot

76
00:32:55,670 --> 00:33:00,350
even guarantee that it will work out in you,
I cannot guarantee. You see you cannot say

77
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:08,300
that this flower will become a fruit can you
say that? But one can try. If there is a possibility,

78
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:13,140
a potentiality is there it will work out.
And there is a potentiality in every human

79
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:18,290
being that it can work out, but first of all
you have to be honest about it, you have to

80
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:26,450
be open about it.
Now within us are these seven centres, if

81
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:31,640
you see the red one, the yellow one, the green
one, the blue one and here is a little smoky

82
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:39,290
one and then here is like the light and ultimately
this big one which we call as Sahasrara. These

83
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:47,950
are the subtle centres and they control outside
the centres that are known to the doctors

84
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:57,850
as plexuses, outside in the gross. Now these
centres are very subtle centres and govern

85
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:04,450
our parasympathetic nervous system. And this
parasympathetic nervous system is beyond our

86
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,020
control.

87
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:12,040
For example, when you want to increase the
beat of your heart you can run, you can do

88
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:17,930
some exercise, the heartbeat will increase.
But to reduce it there is a force of this

89
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:27,980
parasympathetic which brings it down automatically,
spontaneously, Sahaj! Now when you go say

90
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:35,690
to think about, when you go to some Gurus
or some other people and you go and try to

91
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:43,110
seek somewhere else, apart from yourself,
then what happens? Then you start moving away

92
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:48,540
from the central path, we have to keep to
the central path and that’s why all the

93
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:54,940
religions have come, to keep the balance,
to keep the balance! And once you have the

94
00:34:54,940 --> 00:35:01,730
balance, then only it is easy for the ascent.
As you know, I was happy to know that in this

95
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:08,230
place you make some small aeroplanes. Now
the basic thing of aeroplane is that it should

96
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:14,110
be a balanced thing, if it is not balanced
properly it cannot ascend. The whole thing

97
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:20,070
depends on its balance and its angle, so it
has to have an angle upward and it has to

98
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:25,490
have balance. So the first thing is to have
the balance which takes place at this point

99
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,950
where you see the green, Void we call it.
(Refer to chart)

100
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:29,560
(Shri Mataji refers to chart at the Medina
Theatre)

101
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:34,540
Here the balance of the religion comes in.
All the religions of the world have come on

102
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:41,660
this Earth to tell us that be moderate, don’t
go to extremes. But we go to extremes absolutely

103
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:49,420
blindfolded, we follow extreme pattern of
life and then our balances go out. The another

104
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:55,850
thing of an aeroplane is that your eyes are
upward, you have to look upward and that is

105
00:35:55,850 --> 00:36:02,350
what Christ has done, to tell us that you
have to look upward. You are to be born again,

106
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:07,180
and when he said that Nichodemus asked Him,
he asked Him what do you mean? Am I to enter

107
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:13,640
into my mother’s womb? He said no, that’s
the flesh. The flesh can give birth to only

108
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:18,980
flesh but I am talking about the Spirit and
the Spirit has to give you the birth again,

109
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:22,330
and that’s what it is, has to happen within
us.

110
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:29,200
Now this Kundalini about which He spoke is
at the base, at the bone called Sacrum bone.

111
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,580
Sacrum, now see the word Sacrum itself is
suggestive it’s a sacred bone. I asked the

112
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:40,020
Greeks why you call it a sacrum bone? They
said that because they found that when you

113
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:45,920
burnt the body, you see in cremation, this
bone doesn’t burn so we thought it was some

114
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:52,110
sacred bone that was there. But it is more
than that, you see in through the unconscious

115
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:55,390
they must have known that this is a sacred
bone.

116
00:36:55,390 --> 00:37:03,730
In this bone lies the representation of the
Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost is the Mother. We say

117
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:12,870
God the Father, God the Son, have you ever
heard a father and a son without a Mother?

118
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:19,070
We don’t want to accept that there could
be a Mother. There could be a Mother! Christ

119
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:28,260
didn’t talk of his own Mother because he
was a little bit, acted on more understanding

120
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:33,250
that if he says that His Mother has any powers
they’ll first kill Her and the whole drama

121
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:40,270
of crucifixion will be spoilt. So he didn’t
talk about Her, but the Mother is the primordial

122
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:46,810
Mother represented within us, is this Kundalini
the Holy Ghost! And it is also said, the Holy

123
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:51,820
Ghost, the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.
It has to rise and come up.

124
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:57,170
Now the misunderstanding of the Bible is so
much because of misinterpretations of people.

125
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:01,970
Firstly I would say that people think that
when the Holy Ghost blesses you, you become

126
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:07,110
like a madman, you talk of funny things, it
is not so. One must understand what is written

127
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:12,380
in the bible clearly, that when they got the
Holy Ghost, the blessings of the Holy Ghost

128
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:18,950
the cool breeze came in and then they started
talking in strange languages with strange

129
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:24,040
hands, hand movements. Now what does that
mean? That means that they started talking

130
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:29,790
about the centres. When you hear these Sahaja
Yogis talking, they will not say that you

131
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:34,230
are suffering from ego, they’ll say, it’s
Agnya, Agnya chakra is catching. Christ’s

132
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:38,830
chakra is catching! They don’t talk on the
same language because it’s a subtler language,

133
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:45,100
so they talk on those languages and that’s
why it looks strange to a person who is not

134
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:50,170
exposed to this knowledge, to the deeper knowledge
of your being. Naturally it looks strange

135
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:54,630
and when they move their hands, they have
to use their hands because the power is flowing

136
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:59,040
through their hands so they move sometimes
like this, sometimes like this and then people

137
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,820
can think they are mad.
This is the big misunderstanding, then when

138
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:09,610
people say that the Holy Ghost has descended
on us and then that’s why we are behaving

139
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:18,240
like mad people, it’s the spirit, it’s
the dead spirit, is a possession, is a witchcraft!

140
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:23,620
And when it happens you don’t behave like
a mad person but you become the sanest of

141
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:28,980
the sanest, wisest of the wisest, you become
a balanced person, you become a beautiful

142
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:36,600
person, your face changes, the whole face
glows and the whole life changes. This is

143
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:43,200
what should happen a complete transformation.
Now we have here somebody who is a Sahaja

144
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:49,420
Yogi who is looking after the centre here
but he came through a girl who was in London

145
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:54,060
first time I met her, and she was a hippie,
a very clever, intelligent girl. She was a

146
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:59,660
hippie and taking drugs and when she came
to me, I mean she was absolutely in coma sort

147
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:04,720
of condition. I looked at her she couldn’t
even talk to me, I couldn’t talk to her

148
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:10,770
she was absolutely a gone case, she was a
seeker. And today she is a person who has

149
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:16,810
such a big organisation, you can call it,
we don’t call it organisation but it’s

150
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:23,260
such a big congregation of people who are
being self-realised, whose lives are changed

151
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:29,420
and she’s a different person. Now she has
become an MA in psychology and she has children

152
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:34,980
and a husband who is another fantastic person
and they are leading a very happy married

153
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:39,070
life transforming people.
So the first thing that should happen you

154
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:46,150
should be transformed. The first transformation
takes place that you must have body… peace,

155
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:54,770
I think, bodily peace or you can say that
you get cured of your physical ailments. (Shri

156
00:40:54,770 --> 00:41:04,780
Mataji speaks aside to those holding the chart)
So, in this body, changes that takes place

157
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:09,750
within us you see, that when the Kundalini
rises she supplies the vital force within

158
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:15,280
us. When of course we have been able to cure,
we shouldn’t say we but this Kundalini,

159
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,350
this your Holy Ghost within you has been able
to cure: cancer, leukaemia; this girl the

160
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:24,800
one whom I’m telling you about, her own
brother was suffering from leukaemia and he

161
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,370
was told that he’ll die within one year,
one month’s time and he’s quite alright,

162
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:35,500
he’s doing very well, he’s perfectly alright,
but doctors don’t want to believe it. When

163
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:39,710
it was pointed out, they said you write to
us, and people are writing to them, and British

164
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:44,100
Medical Association wanted to find out and
it’s such a big you know, red tape going

165
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:50,880
up. But it’s true, why, why this cancer
is cured through Sahaja Yoga is a very simple

166
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,130
thing, one should understand why cancer is
caused.

167
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:59,730
If you know why cancer is caused then you’ll
know how Kundalini can cure and you will know

168
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:03,880
how to cure yourself, not only but you will
know how to cure others. It’s not just touching

169
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:09,380
like a spiritualist who’s hands are shaking,
but it’s actually, you’ll know like a

170
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:15,660
doctor, like a specialized doctor. Even you
may not be the doctor, how this person is

171
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:22,070
suffering from cancer and how he’s cured.
As you have seen here there are centres within

172
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:29,610
us. Now the centres are made from the left
and right hand side of the power, of the,

173
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:34,470
we can say the sympathetic nervous system
and the centre that you see in the here, (Mother

174
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,120
demonstrates with Her hands forming two circles
with index finger and thumb but joined as

175
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,790
one circle) is on the parasympathetic nervous
system.

176
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:44,570
Now sympathetic is the one by which we work
out our emergencies. Now when what happens

177
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:48,110
in life when you have too many emergencies?
Say leukaemia, how is it caused? Leukaemia

178
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:58,380
is caused by people who are very futuristic,
who think too much, who are always in emergency.

179
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:04,370
Like supposing early in the morning you get
up and half eyes open you see the newspaper,

180
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:09,780
there’s some shocking news, you get an emergency,
your spleen starts working, it has to produce

181
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:18,380
more blood cells to give a protection to you.
Now then after that you get ready, you’re

182
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:23,800
already late, you get into your car, you see
a jam, you have to reach in time, and this

183
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:28,880
has to happen. All emergencies all the time
working on you, and you’re extremely on

184
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,480
time, you are very particular about everything,
you have to do it, you are very particular

185
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:38,520
about your child and you work it out. Even
women, when they are pregnant, when they are

186
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:43,720
so particular about things and they make so
many emergencies out of their lives, then

187
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:48,340
their spleens act on the child and the child
can also get leukaemia! The mother can get

188
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:53,800
leukaemia!
The speed you see is controlled by your spleen

189
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:59,280
and the spleen is the speedometer which goes
crazy, mad because it does not know when to

190
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:05,620
produce more blood cells, when not to produce,
becomes crazy. Now we can say the state is

191
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:11,790
of a vulnerability, you are vulnerable to
cancer. At this time if you happen to meet

192
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:17,370
someone who has been to the dead, who has
been to the cemetery or somebody who has a

193
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:24,040
guru or somebody who happens to do all these
trance and all this nonsense and all these

194
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:29,080
funny movements that are on, you will get
cancer.

195
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:37,420
Now recently, about a year back I saw a beautiful
research work of some doctors and what they

196
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:44,830
said was that cancer is caused by entities,
they call them protein 52, protein 58, which

197
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:51,190
trigger it and they tried to show some photographs,
but one thing they said that these entities

198
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:58,420
remain in our being since our creation.
Means in the collective subconscious, so since

199
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:05,270
then they are there and once you start moving
towards the dead you are much more vulnerable

200
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:09,900
than a normal person. And that’s how the
cancer is set in every moment, they say, means

201
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:14,290
you become vulnerable every moment because
the pressures of life are such.

202
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:23,440
But what does the Kundalini do? When she rises,
what does she do? She creates an atmosphere

203
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:30,620
within the centre, that exhausted centre gets
the vital force and it tries to bring the

204
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:36,400
attention to the centre. Once you come to
the centre you get connected with the whole

205
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:42,320
again because cancer is set in, when all your
chakras, all your centres are exhausted or

206
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:46,400
one centre is exhausted and it gets broken
up like that. (Shri Mataji gestures with her

207
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,840
hands the two circles coming apart) It has
no connection with the whole and it becomes

208
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:56,170
malignant. When it becomes malignant that
time this triggering takes place, in the sense

209
00:45:56,170 --> 00:46:01,460
it is vulnerable to malignancy and triggering
takes place, that’s how you get cancer.

210
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:07,740
Heart trouble for example, the other day I
was read that English have the greatest enemy

211
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:14,640
as heart trouble. Is absolutely curable and
you can become absolutely heart proof once

212
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:19,650
you get into Sahaja Yoga. Now what happens,
how do we get, these are very subtle things

213
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:24,690
which are to be seen how it works out. Heart
troubles are of two types one is a lethargic

214
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:30,130
heart and another is a heart which is over
active. Now the lethargic heart, you get angina

215
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:34,540
and all these troubles. Now these differentiations
are not in medical terminology, I have done

216
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:38,670
myself medicine; I know they don’t have
all these terminologies, but a person who

217
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:44,280
has a lethargic heart is a different absolutely
the opposite, juxtaposition of a person who

218
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:51,870
has a heart which is overactive.
Now these two things are caused by the deficiencies

219
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:58,670
in our being itself. Now what happens is that
we have two channels of sympathetic nervous

220
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:02,860
system, one on the left, one on the right.
If you use the left side too much like the

221
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:07,670
people who go to these dead and all that,
they are on the left side, those who cry too

222
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:15,490
much, sly people, they are sort of what you
call the masochist type people, in extreme

223
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:19,950
they are like that. The another are the type
that are opposite, sadistic and the aggressive

224
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:23,990
type. So one are the left side the other are
the right sided.

225
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:30,100
Now those who are left sided people are more
prone to cancer and the right sided people

226
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:35,780
are more prone to the heart, because what
happens that when you start working very hard,

227
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:42,890
and you start going to the work much earlier
than its time, and you sit down there and

228
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:48,970
you worry about this and worry about that,
then your attention goes out and there is

229
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:54,470
no attention to your spirit which resides
in the heart. As long as spirit resides in

230
00:47:54,470 --> 00:48:01,490
your heart you’ll live but as soon as it
disappears you die. So this spirit gets annoyed.

231
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:07,570
When it gets annoyed it goes into different
kinds of contortions, it goes into different

232
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:12,360
kinds of defects.
So the attention that is outside too much,

233
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:17,470
how will you pull it inside? If I say you
put your attention inside, I’ll meditate,

234
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:24,360
meditate. How? Something has to happen within
and when that happens, your attention is attracted

235
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:30,120
inside and that happening is the happening
of the Kundalini. Now the word Kundalini should

236
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:36,850
not upset you because it’s an Indian word,
but it means a coil, because it is in three

237
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:43,240
and a half coils, is what you call the Holy
Ghost within yourself which rises and gives

238
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:52,490
you your second birth which really makes you
the person who is not an egg anymore but a

239
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:58,030
bird. This is what it is, that’s why on
Easter Day we give an egg, to suggest that

240
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:03,460
Christ showed us the way by His crucifixion,
how we have to become the birds.

241
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:09,470
People don’t know why we give eggs, we just
give eggs to people on Easter days without

242
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:15,900
knowing why we do it. Like I asked them why
is it called as River †Medina? And why is

243
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:21,130
it called Isle of ‡Wight, no one knows,
we just accept it as it is. But there are

244
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:26,600
reasons for everything because all these things
have come from the unconscious which is universal,

245
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:30,650
which is everywhere.
So what happens to you that once you become

246
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:36,900
conscious of that universal unconscious, you
become universal yourself because spirit is

247
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:41,340
universal. The cool breeze starts flowing
through your hands, the cool breeze starts

248
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:47,830
coming out of your head. Now jumping, changing
dresses, enrolment and all these things cannot

249
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:52,710
bring out the cool breeze from your head,
can it? The cool breeze starts coming from

250
00:49:52,710 --> 00:50:01,400
your head and you start feeling the cool breeze
from your finger tips and when these, what

251
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:06,330
you call the waves of cool breeze, you get
it. Then, you feel absolutely peace, there

252
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:10,990
is no thought and you enter into the Kingdom
of God.

253
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:15,990
Now these are the ones that tell you the truth
(Shri Mataji gestures with Her hands). You

254
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:22,620
ask about someone whom you know to be a crook,
ask it, is he a good man or a bad man? Immediately

255
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:29,150
you’ll find it’s burning coming or a hot
thing coming on your hands. But supposing

256
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:35,230
you know a very good man, who you know he’s
a very good, nice person, you ask about him,

257
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:40,160
it will start, it will soothe down. If he’s
a realized soul, cool breeze may start coming

258
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:45,030
into your hands. That’s how you will know
who is a realised soul and who is not. So

259
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:52,140
many people are really these days, are hypocrites
of the worst type and from India we have a

260
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:56,340
speciality in telling lies, I must say, the
way they have come here to make money, befool

261
00:50:56,340 --> 00:51:01,970
you and take away money but it was actually
the idea came to them through some people

262
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:06,690
who think that they can take money in the
name of God, in the name of religion. They

263
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:11,900
can organise things and that’s how they
started doing it. They think that they can

264
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:16,270
befool you now, in a very subtle way they
tried to befool the people here, they made

265
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:20,390
a lot of money, I mean they have Rolls Royce’s
and this and that.

266
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:24,420
In America, you’ll be surprised, when I
went there, the newspaper people asked me,

267
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:28,360
how many Rolls Royce’s she has? So they
said She hasn’t got anything, She doesn’t

268
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:32,980
take anything, they said we are not interested
in a person who has no Rolls Royce. That’s

269
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:38,020
where we have reached into materialism, to
that extent, that now we cannot see things

270
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:46,720
correctly. We are blinded now by this money
and money orientation. To such an extent we

271
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:51,720
have come, now we are challenging Christ.
You must have heard about this new movement

272
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:57,020
of challenge of Christ, I mean it’s horrifying
how can you challenge a person who was really

273
00:51:57,020 --> 00:52:02,200
the Son of God, because you have not felt
it, when you feel it, you know that he is

274
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:06,340
the Son of God, you ask the question, was
he the Son of God, and you get tremendous

275
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:12,270
breeze in your hands.
You are not yet authorised to talk about Him

276
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:16,580
and to denounce Him and say these things.
Actually Paul, I don’t know, when, I read

277
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:20,730
Bible for the first time, I was shocked, I
said who is this Paul, why is he there, what

278
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:25,100
is he doing? How is he connected with Christ,
I didn’t understand, this man he has nothing

279
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:29,110
to do with Christ, he has no vibrations. I
was surprised Kahlil Gibran has said about

280
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:35,990
him, this strange man Mr Paul. He will always
deny that there were no miracles about Christ,

281
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:43,010
he will, because he was not a man who was
a free man, he was not a free soul. He himself

282
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:48,620
was suffering from epilepsy, can you imagine
a man suffering from epilepsy talking about

283
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:55,220
Christ. He was the man who had seizures so
many times, and how could he talk about Christ,

284
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:59,780
he thought it was a good way of befooling
people and becoming something great by taking

285
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:06,460
over. But you beware about it; don’t listen
to these things, these intellectuals. Intellectuals

286
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:10,250
can never understand Christ and they have
never understood Him. Only the people who

287
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:15,900
are seekers, those who are seeking the truth,
will know what Christ was. It’s amazing,

288
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:20,490
in India, people are shocked to hear that
people are talking like this about Christ.

289
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:25,990
How can you understand God? First, at least
get your self-realisation, at least become

290
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:29,730
the self, what Christ has said, first achieve
your realisation.

291
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:34,570
For that you go to the church, a priest puts
his hand on your head, like William Blake

292
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:40,640
said that, “A priest cursed me on my head”,
and then you think you are realised, how can

293
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:46,360
you be? How can you be realised? By a person
who himself is not realised? The Kundalini

294
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:50,730
has to come up, you have to feel the cool
breeze, you have to become a realised soul

295
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:55,530
where you feel the collective consciousness,
by which you feel your own centres and you

296
00:53:55,530 --> 00:54:00,120
feel the centres of others.
I was amazed when I came to England, I could

297
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:07,370
not believe these intelligent, sensible people
who we knew in India have now taken to witchcraft

298
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:13,210
of all kinds; we thought it’s only in India,
where people are very poor, they take, poverty

299
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:17,600
takes to these things and when they become
poor they go more to these things and then

300
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:25,350
they become poorer, it’s a vicious circle.
These dead spirits always create poverty and

301
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:31,500
greater poverty, diseases. This, all kinds
of diseases, which are left sided come from

302
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:38,570
them. But I was amazed how intelligent people
have taken to this and to talk the whole thing

303
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:45,670
people have come from India and they said
you have to pay £6000. For what? To jump,

304
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:54,910
to what is it, to fly in the air, to fly,
why do you want to fly? What is the interest

305
00:54:54,910 --> 00:55:00,030
of God to make you fly? He doesn’t want
you to become birds does he? Use your brains,

306
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:06,100
and they paid £6000 pounds for this man,
each, for flying and then when he hurt them

307
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:12,230
they came to me, with all epilepsies and things
like that and are they flying anywhere? He

308
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:18,600
has made a big money out of you!
With all the intelligence, with all the brains

309
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:25,050
God has given us, with a person like Christ
we have known, how can we do these things?

310
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:32,360
Let us now know that it is for us, for our
good, for our own benefit, that we have to

311
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:37,830
become the self is the whole property that
God has given us, all the wealth that God

312
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:45,640
has given us within us and it is no use clinging
on to someone, to be someone’s pleader,

313
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:53,450
somebody’s professor or somebody’s disciple.
Better become your “self”! Unless and

314
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:58,220
until you become your self, you cannot talk
about Divine, you cannot talk and that is

315
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:05,790
a different line altogether where you become
absolutely peaceful and you become collectively

316
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:11,710
conscious. The collectively consciousness
is described by Jung, who got his realisation

317
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:18,480
very late in life, but he described it, that
in the days when people will come they will

318
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,990
have their realisation and they will have
collective consciousness.

319
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:27,440
Mohammed Sahib has clearly said that when
the resurrection time will come, your hands

320
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,440
will speak; in the Koran, most of it is about
resurrection he has talked. But the Muslims

321
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,850
won’t talk of the resurrection; they will
talk of the doomsday because they want to

322
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:40,900
put fright into people so that they can get
their money and have their big organisations

323
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:45,770
to make money and make their mosques and things.
What is a mosque? What is a temple? What is

324
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:51,750
a church, but the church within yourself!
This is the church you have to build, you

325
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:57,510
are the church yourself! What are you belonging
to? Everything belongs to you, you have to

326
00:56:57,510 --> 00:57:00,550
become that.
As he has said, (Dr. Warren in the introduction)

327
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:05,890
I have nothing to gain, is not true, I have
to gain one thing, the darkness has to go.

328
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:11,860
Darkness has to go, you have to see the light
that’s very important, that’s my mission

329
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:17,140
for which I have come to your beautiful Island.
I’m sorry it is only for one day I’m here

330
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:23,170
and I won’t be here for tomorrow because
we have other programs and they fixed me up

331
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:26,870
you see so I have to move from one place to
another according to their programmes. But

332
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:32,600
whatever it is I’m very happy to see you
all here and I hope you people will understand

333
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:39,670
what I am trying to tell you. What I am requesting
you and warning you that be careful, better

334
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:45,920
look after yourself, this is the time of judgement!
This is the time of judgement! Do not postpone

335
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:51,620
it, you will be judged by your Kundalini,
by nothing else, your own Kundalini will judge

336
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:57,010
you and you will know your own judgement by
which you can cure yourself. I don’t have

337
00:57:57,010 --> 00:58:00,550
to tell you, this is wrong with you, that
is wrong with you, you yourself will know.

338
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:04,760
You’ll know on your fingertips, in English
language, they say “you know on your fingertips”.

339
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:09,440
All the centre’s that are, I’ve shown
you, are five, six and seven centres on the

340
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:14,510
left hand side, and five and six and seven
centres on the right hand side, they will

341
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:19,320
tell you. Even a child who is a realised soul
can tell you, what’s wrong with you, what’s

342
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:27,970
wrong with himself and how to get alright.
But the one snag is that people get realisation,

343
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:36,800
is the parable of Christ when he described,
that some seeds were thrown onto rocks, some

344
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:42,490
on the sand but some on the fertile land,
like that. So those who fall into fertile

345
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:48,560
land, you may get your realisation today,
I don’t say you may not, but to retain it,

346
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:53,110
to grow into it, you have to work it out.
Which is today is a collective working, you

347
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:58,590
cannot just sit at home, Mother I’m meditating,
it doesn’t work out, you have to have a

348
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:03,640
collective working out.
Let us see out of you how many want to have

349
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:08,910
it and grow into it. There’s nothing that
should enslave you, on the contrary you should

350
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:13,290
get over all your habits and all that, you
should become a master of your “self”.

351
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:19,650
That’s what it is, and you become! There
are thousands in the mainland who have got

352
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:23,340
realisation and why should you be left behind
I don’t understand.

353
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:27,850
I’m here now for ten years. I’ve been
working very hard, with people in the beginning

354
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:33,900
I had only six people and for four years I
was struggling with them to make them something

355
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:40,540
and now they are great people and one of them
is the girl about whom I have told you. So

356
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:47,380
it is not difficult, now suddenly the speed
has improved and people are getting realisation

357
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:52,300
but still in the West it is very slow compared
to in India, because people are simple and

358
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:56,880
innocent and have the basis, they know what
is Kundalini, they have the basis, I don’t

359
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:00,590
have to argue with them and tell them about
it because traditionally they have known these

360
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:04,760
things, they are just there and they get it.
What he told you about six thousand and seven

361
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:09,410
thousand people is a fact, but it’s in Indian
villages. I’ve worked in the villages than

362
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:15,060
in the city because city is more sort of money
orientated, they are not seeking God or they

363
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:19,200
are not seeking higher things but what they
are seeking is plastic. So let them have plastic

364
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:23,310
for the time being, when they get fed up with
it then they may seek God. But more I’m

365
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:30,310
working in the villages of India and I hope
that something will turn out of this meeting

366
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:35,040
with you people.
May God Bless You.

367
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:43,140
I’m sorry in this short time I could not,
somehow, elaborately talk to you about it

368
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:48,250
but these people have got my tapes and I must
have given thousands of lectures in English

369
01:00:48,250 --> 01:01:00,500
language. You can listen to them and can have
more ideas about it and you can deepen your

370
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:04,450
knowledge about Sahaja Yoga, but first thing
is that you get your light, first you get

371
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:10,700
your realisation because if I have to talk
about these lights before putting on the lights

372
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:15,660
then I can give you a big lecture on how these
lights are made and what is the history behind

373
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:19,600
it, and how it was discovered, from where
it is coming but it’s a headache ….first

374
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:23,600
you have the light and then you see everything
in the light, it is much better. I would request

375
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:29,840
you that first you have your realisation.
And there’s one thing that Dr. Warren has

376
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:36,140
said, that one has to be humble. That also
is quite a challenging word, I think, there’s

377
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:41,670
nothing to be humble about it, I mean you
just have to be a gentleman, that’s all.

378
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:46,520
You need not be harsh with me and if you try,
you can try it, I mean it doesn’t matter

379
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:52,350
with me but you should not disturb other people
by your aggressiveness so, let those who want

380
01:01:52,350 --> 01:01:58,390
to have, let them have it. There should be
no dog in the manger attitude and that only

381
01:01:58,390 --> 01:02:33,720
I would request that you should try to achieve
it yourself and let others have it. Thank

382
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:40,860
you very much.
(Dr. Warren requests people who have come

383
01:02:40,860 --> 01:03:32,130
for the first time and want their realisation
to come to the front of

384
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:50,990
the theatre.)
Another thing I have to make a very humble

385
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:56,600
request is, we have to take out our shoes
because this Mother Earth helps us a lot to

386
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:00,840
consume many of our problems and tensions.
It’s a very helpful thing so we should take

387
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:12,570
it out. You have to take help. We have to
take help from all the elements and they help

388
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:51,550
us if we really want them so better take out.
So nice to see so many Seekers.

389
01:04:51,550 --> 01:05:02,960
Alright, as I said it is not possible to guarantee
anything but there’s one thing I have to

390
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:09,590
request you because this is my experience
so far, that people in the west unnecessarily

391
01:05:09,590 --> 01:05:15,810
feel guilty, I don’t know why. This feeling
guilty is sort of in the atmosphere and there

392
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:20,240
is nothing to feel guilty about anything,
what are you feeling guilty about? You see,

393
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:29,170
that’s one thing you must get rid of because
I am talking about God who is the embodiment

394
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:37,660
of compassion, embodiment of love. Above all,
He’s the ocean of forgiveness. What mistakes

395
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:42,290
can you commit? If I have said anything in
my lecture which might be giving you that

396
01:05:42,290 --> 01:05:46,790
feeling of, oh I should not have done this
or that – you must know that to err is human

397
01:05:46,790 --> 01:05:52,600
and to forgive, Divine. So please do not try
to condemn yourself for anything, I have to

398
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:57,610
make a very, very humble request because when
I came to your Island, I felt that this, the

399
01:05:57,610 --> 01:06:05,660
first feeling I got was oh Baba, the people
are so guilty. So please get over that. First

400
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:13,600
of all, you must tell yourself that, “I
am not guilty at all”.

401
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:21,930
Alright. So we sit in a very pleasant mood,
not a frivolous but a pleasant mood because

402
01:06:21,930 --> 01:06:28,360
we are now going into the Kingdom of God which
is promised to us and that’s what we have

403
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:34,730
to get it. You have done no sins whatsoever,
forget your past, forget all about it. Just

404
01:06:34,730 --> 01:06:41,190
think that you have come here to achieve your
Selfhood. For that you don’t have to blame

405
01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:51,730
yourself for anything that you have done,
you just forget about it. That’s very important.

406
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:57,460
And there is nothing serious about it. It’s
a very pleasant experience, nothing happens

407
01:06:57,460 --> 01:07:03,150
to you if you start thinking how miserable
you are, this is… forget about it. Just

408
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:09,280
now, at this moment, at this present moment,
you are a person who wants to enter into the

409
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:13,530
Kingdom of God.
Supposing if you have to go to the Queen’s

410
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:19,610
party. You’ll dress up well, you put up
a smile. You look very nice because you don’t

411
01:07:19,610 --> 01:07:25,280
want to put a show that you are feeling unhappy.
In the same way now, if you have to enter

412
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:35,180
into the Kingdom of God, which is the highest
for us, we have to be very happily built up

413
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:43,470
within ourselves. It’s a very pleasant experience
and you will enjoy it. There’s no sensation

414
01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:50,110
but an experience of a very eternal value.
So I would request you not to get into any

415
01:07:50,110 --> 01:07:57,720
morose or a gloomy conditions but to be in
a pleasant condition. Or not also, in a very

416
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:04,360
ego high handed position but in the centre
expecting to happen to you. It should happen

417
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:08,580
to all of you. May God bless you.
Now what you have to do is to little bit,

418
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:15,760
if there is anything tight on your waist,
if it is very tight, if it is uncomfortable,

419
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:19,190
anything uncomfortable to you when you are
sitting, if it is not it’s alright.

420
01:08:19,190 --> 01:08:23,400
Please take out your glasses also, there’s
no need because you’ll be closing your eyes

421
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:29,440
completely and sit very comfortably with both
the feet on the Mother Earth, straight parallel

422
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:34,150
like this because we have to look after the
left and the right side. And now you have

423
01:08:34,150 --> 01:08:38,710
to put the hands like this because I told
you all the centres are here, they have to

424
01:08:38,710 --> 01:08:42,960
receive the vibrations to begin with and then
it happens to you automatically, spontaneously,

425
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:51,050
like a sprouting of a seed. You don’t have
to do anything about it. Actually, you’ll

426
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:56,160
feel that there is no thought in your mind,
automatically, you don’t have to tell, don’t

427
01:08:56,160 --> 01:09:00,480
fight your thoughts. Let the thoughts come
in, they will all disappear because you will

428
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:04,790
become thoughtlessly aware, it’s a becoming.
You cannot force into it, so don’t put in

429
01:09:04,790 --> 01:09:14,320
any effort just sit comfortably forward but
in the centre, in a very normal way, but not

430
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:19,570
slouchy nor very backward but just in the
centre.

431
01:09:19,570 --> 01:09:25,640
Now, close your eyes, till I tell you don’t
open your eyes, you are not to open your eyes

432
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:34,500
because if your eyes are open, the Agnya chakra
which is the centre of Christ, you see it

433
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:40,470
doesn’t allow the Kundalini to rise because
the attention is pulled inside and you get

434
01:09:40,470 --> 01:09:47,780
the dilatations of the pupil, so you better
keep your eyes shut till I tell you that you

435
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:49,440
have to open.

436
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:55,240
Now the left hand side as I told you, is the
desire, the power of desire, our emotions,

437
01:09:55,240 --> 01:10:00,080
our past and everything, so put the left hand
towards me all the time like this and the

438
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:06,060
right hand is the power of action so we have
to use it on different centres to awaken the

439
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:12,690
centres and so that the Kundalini rises and
relieves our centres with our own doing. Nobody

440
01:10:12,690 --> 01:10:15,590
is doing it for us, we ourselves are doing
it.

441
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:25,980
Please close your eyes. Now, you have to put
your right hand on your heart, on your heart,

442
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:31,770
that’s very important, on your heart. Perhaps
you don’t know that London is the Heart

443
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:38,680
of the universe and heart is very important.
Put your right hand on your heart. When you

444
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:44,530
put your right hand on your heart what you
are trying to say is, that in the heart resides

445
01:10:44,530 --> 01:10:50,790
the spirit and that you have to become the
spirit. So you can ask me a question in your

446
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:56,390
heart, you need not loudly ask me. You can
address me as Mataji if you find it easy or

447
01:10:56,390 --> 01:11:01,650
you can call me as Mother, whatever suits
you, whatever you like to call me. You have

448
01:11:01,650 --> 01:11:09,540
to say Mother am I the spirit? Now don’t
open your eyes, just ask the question, an

449
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:27,210
earnest question, three times in your heart,
Mother am I the spirit? Keep the eyes shut…………………because

450
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:43,830
it’s an absolute thing and

451
01:11:43,830 --> 01:12:16,200
if it is an absolute, like a computer it works
and it gives you the answers, so you ask the

452
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:34,800
question Mother am I the spirit? Very simple
question it is! Which you are! (Got it) Now

453
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:43,100
take this right hand down on the stomach on
the upper part of the abdomen. If you are

454
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:51,140
the spirit then you are your own master too.
So you ask a question to me here, three times

455
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:56,310
again, with full confidence in yourself, not
feeling guilty at all, but ask a question,

456
01:12:56,310 --> 01:13:13,530
Mother am I my own master? Am I my own Guru?
Just ask the question! ………………………….Please

457
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:39,210
don’t feel guilty, don’t feel diffident.
Please don’t feel guilty, or diffident you

458
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:44,140
are your own master you have not yet felt
your spirit, that’s why. Don’t be diffident

459
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:56,390
about it; you are your own master, don’t
have to go to any other master. Even if you

460
01:13:56,390 --> 01:14:14,880
have been to a wrong type of a master it can
be cured by this, just asking the question.

461
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:21,290
Please keep all of you your eyes closed. Everyone
should try to get it, what’s the use of

462
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:34,050
standing on the banks or on the fence? Better
to have it, you don’t lose anything.

463
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:45,280
Now please take this hand down below, absolutely
on the lower portion of the abdomen. Here

464
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:54,150
now, for the first time, you have to assert,
you have to ask for something and that something

465
01:14:54,150 --> 01:14:59,810
is the true knowledge, is the art of true
knowledge, the technique of true knowledge.

466
01:14:59,810 --> 01:15:06,140
Yoga means two things; it means first the
union with the Divine and the technique, how

467
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:12,430
to keep the contact all the time, the technique
of the Divine Laws, technique of the Divine

468
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:13,310
machinery.

469
01:15:13,310 --> 01:15:21,080
At this point you have to ask because I cannot
cross your freedom, you are human beings and

470
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:26,860
God has given you freedom and nobody wants
to take your freedom, so you have to ask otherwise

471
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:37,020
I cannot force things on you. So to ask Mother
we want to do the technique of true knowledge,

472
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:44,140
the pure knowledge, the absolute knowledge.
Say it six times because this centre has got

473
01:15:44,140 --> 01:16:20,980
six sub-plexuses; just say that, it is very
important for this place. (Better) So that

474
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:37,520
if you have done things which are not true,
which are not real they’ll drop out.

475
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:46,040
Now as you have asked for this, you have to
assert by putting your hand higher in the

476
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:54,860
abdomen, in the lower part of the stomach,
here as you have put it and you have asked

477
01:16:54,860 --> 01:17:10,160
for it, now you put this hand in the higher
part of the abdomen. Here you have to assert

478
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:15,790
and say with confidence because it is very
important to be confident about it that you

479
01:17:15,790 --> 01:17:26,020
are the spirit, you have to say ten times
Mother I am my own master, just say it. It

480
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:33,470
is not ego it is a fact. Fact is neither ego
nor superego. Just say Mother I am my own

481
01:17:33,470 --> 01:17:39,310
master. To be your own master doesn’t mean
you are aggressive, that means you are master

482
01:17:39,310 --> 01:17:54,800
of yourself nothing can enslave you. Mother
I am my own master. Please say it ten times

483
01:17:54,800 --> 01:18:04,650
with full confidence in yourself. That’s
one thing one should understand that you are

484
01:18:04,650 --> 01:18:12,250
going to become the spirit, which you are
already. It has to manifest. And a person

485
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:25,940
who has no confidence, how can you be? With
full confidence you say I am my own master,

486
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:33,490
ten times.

487
01:18:33,490 --> 01:18:57,480
Now, raise this hand to your heart again,
now with full confidence in yourself you have

488
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:08,730
to assert by saying Mother I am the spirit
twelve times. Mother I am the spirit, you

489
01:19:08,730 --> 01:19:18,840
are the spirit, believe me you are the spirit.
Now don’t doubt it, you are not to doubt

490
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:37,760
yourself. If you have diffidence it is not
going to help us just say at this moment Mother

491
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:51,020
I am the spirit. God has made you a special
category, a special category. Category of

492
01:19:51,020 --> 01:20:04,930
men of God as William Blake has said, “The
men of God will have, will become prophets

493
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:13,660
and they will have powers to make others prophets.
These are the days when you the men of God

494
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:26,840
will become prophets. So just assert Mother
I am the spirit. See now, how it works out.

495
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:59,760
Alright, now raise your hand to a centre on
the left hand side of your neck, where it

496
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:08,820
touches, where it is near the shoulder. Just
put it there, press it hard now, bring the

497
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:13,680
hand a little backward and press it hard.
Now this is the centre which is very badly

498
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:24,340
caught up, is the centre when you feel guilty.
Now sixteen times say and assert that Mother

499
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:28,300
I am not guilty and if you have that habit
better say it one hundred and eight times

500
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:36,160
to punish yourself, (Shri Mataji Smiles) Please
say Mother I am not guilty, what are you guilty

501
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:47,570
about, what have you done? All conditioning,
people have told you, you should be guilty

502
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:53,100
about this, all these ordinary norms upset
you. If you have not said thank you to someone,

503
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:57,080
you are guilty, if you haven’t opened the
door for someone you are guilty; what is this?

504
01:21:57,080 --> 01:22:12,910
We are human beings, what about our dignity?
Some countries have some customs; some countries

505
01:22:12,910 --> 01:22:22,540
have some customs, why to feel guilty about
it? You are an Indian or you are an Englishman

506
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:27,980
or you are a German whatever it is, you are
first of all you are a human being. What is

507
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:55,010
there to feel guilty? Sixteen times! First
forgive yourself, that important, those who

508
01:22:55,010 --> 01:23:03,760
can’t forgive themselves, how can they forgive
others? And why should God forgive them also?

509
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:18,200
It’s kind of a violence towards yourself
is not to forgive.

510
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:27,340
Now put your right hand on your forehead please,
across on your forehead. Now this is the centre

511
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:33,800
as I said of Christ, this is the gate through
which everybody has to pass and here you have

512
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:43,010
to say Mother I forgive everyone. Say it from
your heart. Now don’t remember whom you

513
01:23:43,010 --> 01:23:55,030
have to forgive, in a general statement just
like that. I forgive everyone, put it across,

514
01:23:55,030 --> 01:24:06,580
put the hand across your forehead… fully.
Fully across.

515
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:13,590
Now take this hand on top of your fontanelle
bone, the soft area which you had in your

516
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:19,540
childhood, put your fingers there. Fingers
on that soft area which you had in childhood,

517
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:25,610
now it has become a tough stuff but it will
become soft now. Now you try to press it down

518
01:24:25,610 --> 01:24:31,170
a little bit, and move it clockwise, press
it down with your fingers and move it clockwise.

519
01:24:31,170 --> 01:24:39,580
Now this is one place again where the Kundalini
rises and breaks through this area and you

520
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:47,700
get your self-realisation or your real baptism.
But here again I cannot cross your freedom

521
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:53,780
so you have to say that you want your realisation.
So Mother please give me my realisation I

522
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:58,970
want it. You have to say it otherwise I cannot
force it on you, so press it hard and move

523
01:24:58,970 --> 01:25:05,210
it and say it seven times Mother please give
me my realisation, I want my realisation,

524
01:25:05,210 --> 01:25:09,880
I want to have my realisation, whichever way
you want to say you say but just press it

525
01:25:09,880 --> 01:26:07,840
hard and move the scalp. Say it seven times.
(Shri Mataji blows into the microphone). Now

526
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:16,030
put back your hand where it was before and
now with the left hand try to see if you feel

527
01:26:16,030 --> 01:26:21,910
any cool breeze coming out of your head. Put
your hand about four inches above that area

528
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:28,290
and see if there is a cool breeze. Right hand
you put it on, towards me and with the left

529
01:26:28,290 --> 01:26:33,780
hand you try to feel it. Left hand, with the
left hand you try to feel. Please try to feel

530
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:39,650
it if there’s a cool breeze. At first you
might feel a little hot coming out of you,

531
01:26:39,650 --> 01:26:44,860
possibly. Little higher, just see it, about
not very high, about four inches high at first

532
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:58,330
and then gradually you move up and down and
you’ll see there you’ll feel it. Now turn,

533
01:26:58,330 --> 01:27:05,520
you put your other hand down now left hand
and with the right hand you see. (working

534
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:14,930
out) Try with the other hand see if it’s
coming, if it’s coming you need not see

535
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:21,550
but if it is not coming. There, just put it
up, don’t get disappointed with yourself,

536
01:27:21,550 --> 01:27:25,630
don’t get disappointed, if it is not working
out there are people who will work it out,

537
01:27:25,630 --> 01:27:37,450
you’re getting quite a lot eh? Are you feeling
it? Just raise your hand a little bit; just

538
01:27:37,450 --> 01:27:41,150
see if you are feeling it.

539
01:27:41,150 --> 01:27:49,180
Now put your hands towards me and open your
eyes, just see. Don’t think, the thought

540
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:55,500
is no more in your, just don’t think. Now
see in the hands are you feeling any cool

541
01:27:55,500 --> 01:28:06,420
breeze? Just little bit blowing, a little
hot, rub it, rub your hands a little bit,

542
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:11,690
yes see. They’re a little insensitive, see
for the first time they are exposed to the

543
01:28:11,690 --> 01:28:18,930
Divine now see. For the first time you feel
this all-pervading power that creates everything,

544
01:28:18,930 --> 01:28:30,880
works out everything and which has evolved
us. The power of God’s love. Put your hands

545
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:39,280
up and ask a question, Mother is this the
power of the Holy Ghost, is this the power

546
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:43,730
of God’s Divine Love, is this the complete
power? Now put back your hands and see (Hands

547
01:28:43,730 --> 01:28:57,450
towards Mother on their laps). Are you feeling
the cool breeze in the hands? Don’t think

548
01:28:57,450 --> 01:29:06,440
about it, just don’t think, thinking stops
it. Better now? In the head did you feel it?

549
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:12,730
Now I’ll ask some of the Sahaja Yogis who
have come from England to see for themselves.

550
01:29:12,730 --> 01:29:17,250
But don’t think, that’s one point, just
don’t think. Can you come down and see for

551
01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:22,130
yourselves. (To Sahaja Yogis from the mainland)
More right sided some people are, doesn’t

552
01:29:22,130 --> 01:29:39,940
matter, don’t you worry they all have gone
through the same so don’t you worry. Good,

553
01:29:39,940 --> 01:29:55,810
feeling fine, feeling hot? Is it? Sahaja Yogis
should not talk first of all see for yourself

554
01:29:55,810 --> 01:30:03,640
the vibrations, don’t talk to them. Hello,
don’t talk to them first see the vibrations,

555
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:08,700
because you may disturb. You see they are
just now getting the experience, so you must

556
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:14,260
understand. If you suddenly ask questions
you see, they might get disturbed, don’t

557
01:30:14,260 --> 01:30:28,040
ask questions just see if it is working out.
Alright, is she alright, oh I can see that.

558
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:37,510
These two gentlemen are here. Please everybody
must be attended to see there’s one gentleman

559
01:30:37,510 --> 01:30:50,390
left out there. There are lots of Sahaja Yogis,
Antonio, there’s one gentleman there. Ha!

560
01:30:50,390 --> 01:31:13,280
What do you say, tie them up, is it working
out? What do you say, is he alright? Raise

561
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:34,080
it, tie it up. Raise it, tie it up. You’re
alright, you got it, now don’t think, don’t

562
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:34,080
think.

563
01:31:36,010 --> 01:31:53,070
you want to, experience can be tremendous
for some people. It’s tremendous. Very strong,

564
01:31:53,070 --> 01:32:07,500
great place I must say, surrounded by the
sea. How is the gentleman there, is he alright?

565
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:21,880
Everybody getting it? Doctor Mathur, he’s
got it? Great1 Great seekers. So I bow to

566
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:28,790
you all for such great seekers of truth. You
have found it, now try to know it, become,

567
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:39,310
be serious about it, don’t waste it. It’s
very easy. Thank God we have somebody here

568
01:32:39,310 --> 01:32:47,880
who is very good at Sahaja Yoga and you can
go to his house and he can help you. The whole

569
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:57,920
family is involved into it, the children know,
everyone knows. You and your children your

570
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:10,110
family, everybody will know about it and a
new life of joy for all of you.

571
01:33:10,110 --> 01:33:19,440
Great seekers I tell you, no more diseases,
no more troubles no more tensions, there’s

572
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:38,560
a hole now for everything to go out, so enjoy
yourself. Done! How is this gentlemen here,

573
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:59,950
has he got it? Left Nabhi. The one who doesn’t
have Sahaja Yogis should raise their hands

574
01:33:59,950 --> 01:34:33,250
and tell me. All the people at the back have
got it, have they? Give a bandhan to their

575
01:34:33,250 --> 01:35:05,330
left Agnyas, left Agnyas are there. You will
know all this. It’s nothing Latin. it’s

576
01:35:05,330 --> 01:35:14,370
very simple, simple. Even a child knows as
I told you. Has to be simple, isn’t it.

577
01:35:14,370 --> 01:35:46,970
It has to be universal; it has to be simple,
available to every one of every type, every

578
01:35:46,970 --> 01:36:00,350
quality, every race.

579
01:36:00,350 --> 01:36:09,680
Better take their names and addresses and
things and they can contact. Please now do

580
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:16,120
not waste this experience. This is just the
beginning, you have to become the tree and

581
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:22,170
it’s very simple, you cannot pay for it.
You cannot organise it but you have to ask

582
01:36:22,170 --> 01:36:28,020
for it, just that somebody who knows about
it, tomorrow you will become the knowledge

583
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:36,760
so just go and ask for it. Know for it. Have
you got the books and things? I think that

584
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:43,430
they should get the books there only from
the centre. Why not give then the name of

585
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:50,440
the centre and the address so that they can
get the books there.

586
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:57,720
May God Bless You All. Enjoy Yourself.

587
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:54,140
May God Bless You. That’s how you become the master.
