00:00.357 --> 00:04.817
Shivaratri Puja, Pratisthan, India, 2003-0228

00:05.527 --> 00:14.247
Lord Shiva's biggest quality is forgiveness.

00:14.447 --> 00:22.000
If he doesn’t forgive, then nothing will be spared.

00:22.200 --> 00:25.088
He is very forgiving

00:25.289 --> 00:31.232
and because of his forgiving nature, we are surviving.

00:31.433 --> 00:34.913
otherwise we would have been finished.

00:35.113 --> 00:38.756
from such great god (Mahadev)

00:38.957 --> 00:47.624
we should ask him such qualities as forgiving nature

00:48.961 --> 00:58.599
like his character, like his powers. Despite such qualities he is full forgiveness,

00:58.800 --> 01:04.748
he takes into consideration that we are humans and he forgives.

01:04.948 --> 01:09.048
We should take his quality (guna) of forgiveness.

01:09.248 --> 01:14.551
We do not have such behaviour in which we forgive

01:14.751 --> 01:21.113
We cling to small petty things and fight.

01:21.313 --> 01:33.934
This is not Mahadev’s puja, those who follow him should forgive everyone.

01:34.134 --> 01:37.250
Anyone can commit mistake

01:38.195 --> 01:42.095
Everyone has some faults,

01:42.295 --> 01:45.658
Instead of looking at their faults you look at your own.

01:45.858 --> 01:49.127
and forgive the faults of others.

01:49.328 --> 01:52.642
This is very great quality of his to forgive

01:52.842 --> 01:59.828
and that quality in human race is very rare.

02:00.028 --> 02:03.492
There was time when there were many forgiving people

02:03.692 --> 02:14.839
but now don’t know how people consider anger as a big thing

02:15.092 --> 02:18.612
and they are not even ashamed of it.

02:18.812 --> 02:22.364
But if you are a worshiper of Mahadev(Shiva)

02:22.564 --> 02:32.362
and if you consider Shankar (Shiva) as your Guru

02:32.562 --> 02:42.079
then you have to be forgiving in nature like him.

02:42.279 --> 02:49.366
And despite such powers, if he wants he can destroy anyone.

02:49.566 --> 03:01.852
This is how his power of forgiveness (audio not clear)

03:06.820 --> 03:15.313
Many people worship Shivji to seek his forgiveness.

03:15.513 --> 03:18.859
“ Oh! God Forgive us”

03:19.059 --> 03:23.147
but he is all-forgiving in nature.

03:23.347 --> 03:29.915
And his forgiveness has magnanimity.

03:30.115 --> 03:35.556
Those who cannot forgive cannot be Sahaj yogis.

03:35.756 --> 03:39.768
The first proof of a Sahaj Yogi is that

03:39.968 --> 03:43.743
he is forgiving in nature from the heart.

03:43.943 --> 03:48.719
and he does not calculate what wrong has been done to him.

03:49.062 --> 03:52.593
Forgiveness is like ocean

03:52.793 --> 03:57.133
and to we have to settle in this forgiveness in ourselves.

03:57.333 --> 04:06.318
Then only Mahadev will be established inside us.

04:06.518 --> 04:15.943
But I still see that see that we get angry first instead of forgiving.

04:16.143 --> 04:18.076
forgiveness should come.

04:18.276 --> 04:21.334
and if you do not know how to forgive,

04:21.534 --> 04:24.936
then you wont be able to live in this world.

04:25.136 --> 04:29.839
You will live but you will be always angry with someone

04:30.039 --> 04:37.944
you will be always unhappy with others.

04:38.839 --> 04:41.276
Shivji always lives in bliss.

04:41.476 --> 04:52.980
But when he sees that someone is becoming like Rakshasa

04:53.180 --> 05:01.515
then even with the opening of his one eye that person is destroyed.

05:01.715 --> 05:03.459
That much power he has !

05:03.659 --> 05:08.526
and because he has so many powers that is why

05:08.726 --> 05:11.925
that is why he can forgive.

05:12.681 --> 05:17.177
So in all the powers he has

05:17.377 --> 05:25.971
their essence is that he uses them to forgive.

05:26.171 --> 05:33.303
Those who worship Shivji they have to measure for themselves

05:33.503 --> 05:39.771
that how much can we be forgiving ,how many can we forgive.

05:39.971 --> 05:45.284
In reality this is only the real criteria.

05:45.484 --> 05:48.833
But the anger which resides in us

05:49.033 --> 05:59.015
makes us feel that should correct this person or that person.

05:59.215 --> 06:01.366
This is not a right thing.

06:01.566 --> 06:04.078
Who are you to correct people?

06:04.278 --> 06:07.905
If Shivji is not even correcting them then who are you to do that!

06:08.105 --> 06:14.647
In this way, imagining anything about yourself is wrong.

06:14.847 --> 06:21.005
And by forgiving our heart becomes big

06:21.205 --> 06:26.654
and we can ascend to higher position.

06:26.854 --> 06:30.059
There are various things in life and amongst them

06:30.259 --> 06:37.147
I think that for a human to forgive is a big thing.

06:37.347 --> 06:40.337
Because that is very difficult for him.

06:40.537 --> 06:47.921
He gets angry on any issue and unhappy with anything.

06:48.121 --> 06:52.282
And there is no meaning in becoming unhappy

06:52.678 --> 06:57.575
there is no substance in it.

07:00.566 --> 07:07.086
Either you should have the power of Prem (love) through which

07:07.286 --> 07:13.819
you can understand others or the power of Anand (Happiness/Enjoyment)

07:14.720 --> 07:21.328
I find it difficult that humans are still on the same level

07:21.528 --> 07:28.614
despite realization,feeling vibrations and becoming stable in all aspects.

07:28.814 --> 07:32.954
but the capacity of forgiveness is very less.

07:33.296 --> 07:34.837
so this is wrong.

07:35.037 --> 07:40.719
Getting angry and upset on small things

07:40.919 --> 07:45.211
is not the feature of bhakta (worshiper) of Mahadev.

07:45.411 --> 07:53.911
and those who do his bhakti, their behaviour is full of Shanti (Calm)

07:54.111 --> 08:00.948
because they don’t get angry, such a person cannot remain upset.

08:01.148 --> 08:11.066
so such type of person has higher power of forgiveness.

08:11.266 --> 08:17.233
There are many things in which you should not get entangled.

08:17.433 --> 08:23.821
And you should try as much as possible to forgive (Kshama)

08:24.021 --> 08:29.600
This is the essence of Mahadev’s life.

08:29.800 --> 08:35.309
In our country, we had many great saints and

08:35.509 --> 08:48.140
here,in my opinion generally, we also had big incarnations (Avtarans).

08:48.340 --> 08:52.610
But today, the whole world believes in Shiv.

08:52.810 --> 08:57.366
It is because he can forgive.

08:57.566 --> 09:00.837
And this his special quality.

09:01.037 --> 09:06.200
The remaining other powers he has

09:06.400 --> 09:11.661
we can only achieve it if we learn to forgive.

09:11.861 --> 09:14.734
If we do not know how to forgive anyone then

09:14.934 --> 09:20.567
we can't even reach near his feet.

09:20.767 --> 09:25.450
In this world, mistakes always happen, after all it is human.

09:25.650 --> 09:29.798
But to trouble any human

09:29.998 --> 09:34.859
means distancing ourselves away from Mahadeva

09:35.059 --> 09:40.177
He has forgiven great Sins and Rakshasas

09:40.377 --> 09:45.961
From this he has learned what is love.

09:46.161 --> 09:57.257
And in love, a human should forgive.

09:57.457 --> 10:04.496
So the people who have forgiving nature, they do not develop anger.

10:04.696 --> 10:09.229
In any case they have to forgive,so why to develop anger.

10:09.429 --> 10:13.147
And it is reflected on their face.

10:13.347 --> 10:19.192
They are very simple and loving people.

10:19.392 --> 10:26.166
So we have to measure,how much can we forgive.

10:26.366 --> 10:30.848
And how many people can we forgive.

10:31.048 --> 10:35.642
You have the example of Isa Masi (Jesus Christ)

10:35.842 --> 10:38.387
When they were crucifying him, he said to the God

10:38.587 --> 10:42.649
"They don’t know what they are doing. So forgive them"

10:42.849 --> 10:46.061
He was saying it to Mahadev

10:46.261 --> 10:53.902
They were doing such a big sin, yet he asked for forgiving them.

10:54.102 --> 11:00.771
Based on our health, our heart,this quality (guna)

11:00.971 --> 11:04.713
of forgiveness manifests proportionally.

11:04.913 --> 11:08.826
But I see that as time is passing this quality is decreasing.

11:09.026 --> 11:17.498
Mostly……. Somebody is angry

11:17.698 --> 11:27.285
In this way, many people take to the wrong path and call it Dharma.

11:27.485 --> 11:31.023
Where there is no Shiv, there is no Dharma.

11:31.223 --> 11:37.482
That is why, today we have to promise that,

11:37.682 --> 11:45.277
if we have complications or anger against anyone we must forgive them.

11:45.477 --> 11:58.649
I do agree that, there are many sins from which we cannot be saved.

11:58.849 --> 12:07.943
But if you believe in Shivji, you will be surprised

12:08.143 --> 12:11.451
that you will not be touched by any sin,as your heart is so big

12:11.651 --> 12:17.480
because your heart is full of Shivji

12:17.680 --> 12:21.533
and it will realize it and act on it.

12:21.733 --> 12:29.984
So insulting anyone, underestimating others is wrong.

12:30.184 --> 12:34.331
Who are we to insult others?

12:34.531 --> 12:42.586
Humans due to ego do things like that, this is all the shadow of ego.

12:42.786 --> 12:50.999
And Shiv is such that, he has no ego at all.

12:51.199 --> 13:01.917
He has powers (shakti),despite being aware of them, he doesn’t gets angry.

13:02.117 --> 13:09.002
Because he is aware of his powers and that he can destroy anyone into ashes(Bhasm)

13:09.202 --> 13:19.186
That is why he maintains control, and is very much forgiving in nature.

13:19.386 --> 13:26.357
So we also have to decide today that we will not get angry on anyone,

13:26.557 --> 13:31.143
we will not look for shortcomings in others but ours.

13:31.343 --> 13:34.125
And getting angry on others it is a great sin

13:34.325 --> 13:37.934
because you are Sahaj Yogis.

13:38.134 --> 13:41.030
Hope now onwards you will become

13:41.230 --> 13:45.494
real followers (Bhaktas) of Shiv.Eternal Blessings.
