00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.290
Shri Mataji: Good evening.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.370
Audience: Good evening.

00:00:17.328 --> 00:00:27.018
Shri Mataji: Today is the last day, when I
have to go.

00:00:27.018 --> 00:00:38.668
And you can understand a mother who has so
many children, she has to go from one to another;

00:00:38.668 --> 00:00:54.967
she has the expectation to meet her children
and she has the concern and the longing for

00:00:54.967 --> 00:01:01.928
whom she has so much love.

00:01:01.928 --> 00:01:11.217
That's very difficult to express those feelings:
like waves as if they are taking out something

00:01:11.217 --> 00:01:13.663
from you.

00:01:18.082 --> 00:01:23.998
I do not know really how to thank you all.

00:01:23.998 --> 00:01:26.221
Without you I cannot enjoy anything.

00:01:26.293 --> 00:01:34.269
As I told you, even I may be the Capitalist
and I may have all these powers, so-called,

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:40.898
I'm a complete Communist, I can't enjoy it
alone.

00:01:40.898 --> 00:01:44.197
I have to share it with you.

00:01:44.197 --> 00:01:54.437
At the very outset, I would like to thank
Mr. Sig Paulsen for making it available for

00:01:54.437 --> 00:01:58.488
Me, this beautiful church.

00:01:58.488 --> 00:02:13.017
And you all that I could manifest My love,
could have a rapport with you, whom I have

00:02:13.017 --> 00:02:14.948
known before.

00:02:14.948 --> 00:02:19.078
I'm meeting you again, thanks to him.

00:02:19.078 --> 00:02:24.258
I have to thank Betty, specially.

00:02:24.258 --> 00:02:26.185
She has been so earnest.

00:02:26.471 --> 00:02:31.638
She wrote to Me letters, she telephoned to
Me again and again.

00:02:31.638 --> 00:02:41.528
Oh, she took so much trouble to see that I
come to Houston.

00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:48.198
She has made these four days, fantastic visit
for Me.

00:02:48.198 --> 00:02:56.918
You all have to thank her for what she's done,
it's a very, very great thing that she thought

00:02:56.918 --> 00:03:02.798
of you all and of sharing her joy with you
all.

00:03:02.798 --> 00:03:06.058
She got her realization in Australia.

00:03:06.241 --> 00:03:14.708
It's a chain of thanking, for which I have
to thank Doctor Warren who came to India for

00:03:14.708 --> 00:03:22.658
his realization, and I got stuck to him...

00:03:22.658 --> 00:03:28.548
He was running every moment and he got his
realization.

00:03:28.548 --> 00:03:32.357
Then we have other people here from India.

00:03:32.778 --> 00:03:39.774
Nirmala Modi has come all the way, she's a
very wise Sahaj yogini.

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:47.173
And then we have Hugo, you know he came all
the way.

00:03:48.268 --> 00:03:55.718
Went to Japan from Australia, bought these
equipments and he's come to New York, then

00:03:55.718 --> 00:03:58.678
to Houston.

00:03:58.678 --> 00:04:07.208
Think of them, how much they feel responsible
that they should communicate truth to you

00:04:07.208 --> 00:04:13.438
and that they should arrange this beautiful
program.

00:04:13.438 --> 00:04:16.208
Warren's wife has also come here.

00:04:16.208 --> 00:04:24.548
We have also, another American, Michael, who
is helping a lot.

00:04:24.548 --> 00:04:32.988
The best of all, I would say is one of my
eldest sons, is Mr Gavin Brown.

00:04:32.988 --> 00:04:35.658
Who had something to do with Houston.

00:04:35.658 --> 00:04:44.168
And when I wanted him to put some money for
American tour, I don't know why, he put it

00:04:44.168 --> 00:04:45.762
in Houston Bank.

00:04:46.214 --> 00:04:49.001
I said, "Why Houston of all the things?

00:04:49.223 --> 00:04:50.718
I may never go there."

00:04:50.718 --> 00:04:54.118
He says, "No Mother, Houston is the place."

00:04:54.118 --> 00:05:00.378
Still the money is lying in the Bank here,
for next years program perhaps.

00:05:00.798 --> 00:05:05.608
He has worked very hard and he's going to
stay on here.

00:05:05.608 --> 00:05:08.778
He's a quiet person.

00:05:08.778 --> 00:05:11.008
But he knows a lot about Sahaj Yoga.

00:05:11.495 --> 00:05:13.775
He knows it thoroughly.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.967
He'll tell you each and every thing: How to
cure you chakras.

00:05:17.992 --> 00:05:20.037
How to feel all right.

00:05:21.414 --> 00:05:28.996
Now today, on this day, I'm going to tell
you about the Spirit.

00:05:29.598 --> 00:05:37.309
I have told you about the seven chakras, about
the three nadis, the three channels, that

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:39.428
are within us.

00:05:39.428 --> 00:05:47.652
And today I want to tell you about the nature
of the Spirit.

00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:54.408
The Spirit resides us in our heart.

00:05:56.032 --> 00:06:01.043
It's the reflection of God Almighty.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:10.338
In Sanskrit language: this aspect of God which
is all-pervading and is the first and the

00:06:10.338 --> 00:06:20.557
last, is called as Sadashiva, is the Father,
who does not incarnate.

00:06:21.002 --> 00:06:28.548
We say Yahova, you can say, or the God who
does not incarnate.

00:06:29.358 --> 00:06:42.506
This great aspect which encompasses everything
ultimately and also manifests everything,

00:06:42.783 --> 00:06:48.450
is reflected within our heart as the Spirit.

00:06:48.898 --> 00:06:52.936
This aspect is just the witness aspect.

00:06:53.258 --> 00:07:06.448
It witnesses the play of its power, the Primordial
Power, the Holy Ghost, to see what is created

00:07:06.448 --> 00:07:08.287
by Her.

00:07:08.287 --> 00:07:10.738
He's the only enjoyer of the game.

00:07:10.873 --> 00:07:14.628
He sees the game, the leela, the fun.

00:07:14.628 --> 00:07:20.828
She organizes everything, it is She who gets
divided into three powers, it is She who creates

00:07:20.828 --> 00:07:28.388
the whole universe, it is She who gives us
this evolution, it is She who makes us human

00:07:28.388 --> 00:07:34.978
beings and it is She who has to make us the
higher human being.

00:07:34.978 --> 00:07:40.698
That's the Holy Ghost, the Primordial Holy
Ghost and the reflection of that is this Kundalini

00:07:40.698 --> 00:07:43.416
within us.

00:07:44.508 --> 00:07:46.988
These two have to meet.

00:07:46.988 --> 00:07:53.342
They are separated; the Spirit within you
and the Holy Ghost within you have to meet.

00:07:53.493 --> 00:07:57.787
That is the Yoga, that's the union.

00:07:58.268 --> 00:08:04.928
The seat of the Spirit is on top of your head
here, but He resides in human beings in the

00:08:04.928 --> 00:08:10.578
heart; of course it comes out also and watches
you.

00:08:10.578 --> 00:08:16.868
It is not in our conscious mind, it resides
and watches the whole field.

00:08:16.868 --> 00:08:22.078
[DEL: In San- ] In Gita He's called as Kshetragya,
the one who knows the field, the knower of

00:08:22.078 --> 00:08:23.078
the field.

00:08:23.078 --> 00:08:29.398
He knows everything, He watches; He's just
watching, where we go, what we do, what compromises

00:08:29.398 --> 00:08:37.078
we make, how we run after our seeking, how
we go to falsehood, what we do; everything

00:08:37.078 --> 00:08:40.018
it is watching.

00:08:40.378 --> 00:08:46.817
The Holy Ghost is the one which receives the
information and records everything in itself

00:08:46.817 --> 00:08:55.878
but the information is given by the deity
who is the seed or the spirit of Jesus Christ

00:08:55.878 --> 00:09:01.059
who is sitting down there, Ganesha.

00:09:03.202 --> 00:09:10.992
The Spirit itself is Sat-Chitt-Ananda.

00:09:11.357 --> 00:09:18.521
He exists in the state of truth.

00:09:20.998 --> 00:09:24.248
Now we do not know what truth is.

00:09:24.248 --> 00:09:28.257
People say, "God is Love, God is Truth."

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:33.330
Now what is the truth?

00:09:34.517 --> 00:09:39.840
The truth is this all-pervading power.

00:09:40.278 --> 00:09:56.157
And this all-pervading power is the nature
of the Spirit, which gives you the absolute

00:09:56.157 --> 00:10:01.897
knowledge; now mark it; absolute knowledge.

00:10:01.897 --> 00:10:09.737
For example, if you have to say, "What is
the shape of this ...?"

00:10:09.737 --> 00:10:13.300
You will say, "It's a pyramid."

00:10:13.388 --> 00:10:23.797
All right, but is it a good thing to have
a pyramid for a church or not?

00:10:23.797 --> 00:10:28.870
There could be hundred opinions on that.

00:10:29.328 --> 00:10:35.028
But if you ask Me, or ask any Sahaj yogi,
they said, "Yes, it has to be a pyramid."

00:10:36.663 --> 00:10:38.378
Why?

00:10:38.378 --> 00:10:43.792
Because in a pyramid there is a coefficience
and you feel the vibrations.

00:10:43.948 --> 00:10:51.628
It's absolutely, absolute knowledge.

00:10:52.917 --> 00:10:55.248
That's the truth you know.

00:10:55.248 --> 00:11:00.305
You want to know if a person is fake or not.

00:11:01.047 --> 00:11:11.057
You just put your hands like this and ask
a question, "Is he true?"

00:11:11.438 --> 00:11:15.788
Your vibrations will stop, you may even get
blisters,

00:11:15.813 --> 00:11:19.762
 if you ask such a question about someone.

00:11:20.398 --> 00:11:24.588
So you do not know through your mental activity.

00:11:24.588 --> 00:11:28.677
A person may look very nice, as I told you,
he may behave in such a manner, that you'll

00:11:28.677 --> 00:11:30.958
feel, "Oh, what a fine man he is."

00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:36.675
Is such and such person is a realized soul
or not?

00:11:37.327 --> 00:11:39.939
How will you know?

00:11:39.939 --> 00:11:44.118
You'll just put your hands towards that person
and you'll start getting the vibrations from

00:11:44.118 --> 00:11:46.716
that person; you'll enjoy them.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:55.361
Only after realization only we can really
enjoy other person - really enjoy.

00:11:56.638 --> 00:12:03.952
One day I was in Calcutta and staying in a
hotel on My way to Singapore, and there was

00:12:03.977 --> 00:12:08.269
a very great soul who came to see Me.

00:12:08.477 --> 00:12:10.667
And he just sneaked into the room.

00:12:10.667 --> 00:12:16.537
See, sometimes it happens that some of these
great souls who live in Himalayas and all

00:12:16.537 --> 00:12:19.637
that, they come in.

00:12:19.637 --> 00:12:22.609
And he just saw Me and he fell at my feet.

00:12:23.331 --> 00:12:29.758
And there were at least five, six Sahaj yogis
staying in other rooms and suddenly they felt

00:12:29.758 --> 00:12:38.628
tremendous cool, joy falling on them, a cold
shower like thing.

00:12:38.628 --> 00:12:43.618
And they all came running, one after another.

00:12:43.618 --> 00:12:46.118
"What's happened, what happened?"

00:12:46.118 --> 00:12:47.407
And he was at My feet.

00:12:47.407 --> 00:12:51.379
They opened the door and they said, "Oh, Mother!"

00:12:51.404 --> 00:12:53.939
"Mother, how did you come?"

00:12:53.964 --> 00:12:54.993
"Oh, Mother!"

00:12:55.607 --> 00:12:57.407
And then they started feeling him.

00:12:57.407 --> 00:13:00.737
He was enjoying Me, I was enjoying him.

00:13:00.737 --> 00:13:04.837
And they were all enjoying him.

00:13:04.837 --> 00:13:09.477
You don't have to tell whether a person is
true or not.

00:13:09.477 --> 00:13:16.427
There is no mental deduction, it just happens.

00:13:16.427 --> 00:13:17.427
You start feeling.

00:13:17.427 --> 00:13:21.097
Even children are like that, even small children.

00:13:21.097 --> 00:13:26.358
If they are realized souls, immediately they'll
say, "This is this and this is this," finished.

00:13:26.414 --> 00:13:28.957
There's no compromise, how can you compromise?

00:13:28.957 --> 00:13:33.868
That's what I told you yesterday that Christ
never compromised.

00:13:34.962 --> 00:13:38.752
He'd never compromised.

00:13:38.878 --> 00:13:44.096
How can you compromise with darkness if you
are light?

00:13:44.597 --> 00:13:48.377
So the first thing you are, you are the truth.

00:13:48.623 --> 00:13:54.737
The Spirit tells you what is the truth.

00:13:55.576 --> 00:14:01.808
It tells you everything about everything.

00:14:04.917 --> 00:14:13.250
It is the truth; the knowledge that is pure
is the truth.

00:14:14.068 --> 00:14:19.477
As I told you, Gavin Brown, when he got his
realization, he said, "My father has not telephoned"

00:14:19.477 --> 00:14:24.887
and he put his hands there and he got a burning
here and when they telephoned, he found out

00:14:24.887 --> 00:14:29.497
that his father was down with bronchitis,
and I told him the exactly the same thing.

00:14:31.155 --> 00:14:39.927
Now a person who came to Me the other day
who had multiple sclerosis - is a very serious

00:14:39.927 --> 00:14:45.087
disease according to doctors, but according
to Me it is not.

00:14:45.087 --> 00:14:49.438
And everybody told Me the same centers he
was catching.

00:14:49.438 --> 00:14:56.177
Of course because I have been in the medicine,
I have been in the medical college, I know

00:14:56.177 --> 00:14:59.537
these chakras means what.

00:14:59.537 --> 00:15:01.068
And he told Me that he had this problem.

00:15:01.068 --> 00:15:06.063
Even if he not told Me, I would have known
that he had this problem.

00:15:06.484 --> 00:15:10.549
Everybody will see the same centre is catching.

00:15:11.216 --> 00:15:15.758
So, you are the truth.

00:15:15.758 --> 00:15:21.287
Then after some time you cannot bear untruth.

00:15:21.287 --> 00:15:27.378
You cannot bear falsehood, I mean, we also
are like that, I tell you.

00:15:27.378 --> 00:15:32.737
For example, if I tell you that, "You come
along here there's a very nice chair for you."

00:15:32.737 --> 00:15:35.388
Now you don't see any chair there.

00:15:35.388 --> 00:15:41.227
"Oh you sit down, it is there, believe Me,
imagine there's a chair."

00:15:41.227 --> 00:15:44.327
I mean, nobody would accept that, will you?

00:15:44.327 --> 00:15:45.327
You don't see any chair.

00:15:45.327 --> 00:15:46.327
"There is any.-"

00:15:46.327 --> 00:15:50.347
"No, no, but the imaginary, there is one,
I have placed it, you can't see, I have made

00:15:50.347 --> 00:15:51.347
it invisible.

00:15:51.347 --> 00:15:54.347
You see you just see, you sit down you'll
get it."

00:15:54.347 --> 00:15:59.957
All right you sit down there, and you sit
in that position and after some time you start

00:15:59.957 --> 00:16:00.957
getting the pain.

00:16:00.957 --> 00:16:06.967
"Where's the chair, how do I get the pain."

00:16:06.967 --> 00:16:14.177
That's what Warren told you, it's very practical.

00:16:14.177 --> 00:16:20.758
You immediately know that this is not the
way.

00:16:22.398 --> 00:16:31.246
Now the first centre is very important, is
of the innocence,

00:16:31.271 --> 00:16:37.171
 which gives you the magnetic powers.

00:16:37.623 --> 00:16:43.927
In the sense not only that you are attractive
but, I mean you attract people, but magnetic

00:16:43.927 --> 00:16:48.674
means that you know whether you are moving
to the north or to the south.

00:16:48.857 --> 00:16:52.568
Birds have this power in them, birds have.

00:16:52.568 --> 00:16:57.248
That's how they fly from one place to another.

00:16:57.248 --> 00:16:59.938
Because they can feel the magnet within.

00:16:59.938 --> 00:17:05.777
And a person who is pure at that point, he
never gets lost because he knows which side

00:17:05.777 --> 00:17:06.777
he's moving.

00:17:06.777 --> 00:17:10.677
I mean, I have that power, I have never had
a problem like that.

00:17:10.677 --> 00:17:15.628
I move either to the left or to the right,
or to forward.

00:17:15.628 --> 00:17:18.918
And My husband who is dealing with shipping,
he says, "I have never met a better navigator

00:17:18.918 --> 00:17:20.994
than my wife."

00:17:22.407 --> 00:17:28.097
And it's so spontaneous, I mean, I don't have
to think, I know for definite that you are

00:17:28.097 --> 00:17:30.447
moving in the wrong direction or in the right
direction.

00:17:30.447 --> 00:17:34.497
Even the material movement I mean to say.

00:17:34.497 --> 00:17:40.557
All of them have experience, they have great
drivers and they have got all the maps and

00:17:40.557 --> 00:17:41.557
everything.

00:17:41.557 --> 00:17:47.648
And immediately I know that you are going
on the wrong direction because the magnet

00:17:47.648 --> 00:17:51.468
immediately turns round.

00:17:51.468 --> 00:17:56.248
So the magnet is placed within you there,
but it is to be awakened.

00:17:56.248 --> 00:18:03.758
When it is awakened, these deities when they're
awakened, you become the truth.

00:18:03.758 --> 00:18:10.848
Like the light that comes in, you start seeing
everything as far as your feelings are concerned,

00:18:10.848 --> 00:18:13.008
your experiencing is concerned.

00:18:13.033 --> 00:18:17.532
So you become the truth.

00:18:18.443 --> 00:18:21.111
Now one may say, "How truth could be love?"

00:18:21.294 --> 00:18:22.978
That's a very common question.

00:18:22.978 --> 00:18:29.788
Truth cannot be love because, I mean, if you
tell somebody something that is truth, he

00:18:29.788 --> 00:18:35.938
may not like, and he may be unhappy and it
may not be dear to him, and he might be very,

00:18:35.938 --> 00:18:40.057
very worried about it.

00:18:40.057 --> 00:18:49.787
Manu said, long time back that, "You should
speak the truth and you must speak the things

00:18:49.787 --> 00:18:52.088
which are dear to others."

00:18:52.088 --> 00:18:54.692
"Satyam vadet, priyam vadet."

00:18:54.946 --> 00:18:59.388
People said, "It's not possible, it's an absurd
situation, how can you do it?"

00:18:59.388 --> 00:19:05.848
So Krishna has put something in between, he
said, "Satyam vadet, hitam vadet, priyam vadet."

00:19:05.848 --> 00:19:15.577
You say something that is the truth, always
say the truth, and say something hitam, means

00:19:15.577 --> 00:19:20.731
for the pleasing of your Spirit.

00:19:20.874 --> 00:19:23.138
That's the condition.

00:19:23.138 --> 00:19:30.748
And ultimately that becomes a very dear thing.

00:19:30.748 --> 00:19:38.368
In the beginning one may not like it, but
ultimately, this will be very much liked,

00:19:38.368 --> 00:19:39.768
this truth.

00:19:39.768 --> 00:19:45.038
So all these three he has put together and
said that, "You have to speak the truth, the

00:19:45.038 --> 00:19:55.996
truth has to be pleasing to the Spirit, and
ultimately, the person is going to enjoy it."

00:19:58.218 --> 00:20:12.648
So the truth is: everything is illusion, except
for the Divine Love of God that is all-pervading

00:20:12.648 --> 00:20:17.770
which you can feel through your Spirit.

00:20:20.488 --> 00:20:29.872
This power has got telecommunication, it has
got all that you have created in the science,

00:20:31.018 --> 00:20:33.733
it can coordinate and cooperates.

00:20:34.122 --> 00:20:42.116
It has got all the angels and all the great
souls to help it and to look after you.

00:20:42.667 --> 00:20:54.448
And the top, topping the whole thing is the
quality that loves, it loves you.

00:20:54.448 --> 00:21:06.754
So it doesn't come to you like a sword, it
gives you the time to improve, to judge yourself,

00:21:06.786 --> 00:21:17.087
to rise, to grow, just as a mother would look
after her child, forgive mistakes, see that

00:21:17.112 --> 00:21:26.057
the child rises and grows into complete manhood.

00:21:26.082 --> 00:21:38.166
So it is love and the love that is so powerful
is the truth; and it never fails,

00:21:38.265 --> 00:21:41.228
it never fails.

00:21:41.228 --> 00:21:44.039
For example you might think now, a man like
Sadat has died.

00:21:44.064 --> 00:21:46.119
[Ed: Anwar el Sadat was assassinated on 6
Oct 1981, the day before this talk.]

00:21:46.144 --> 00:21:46.908
"Mother how do you explain?"

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:50.986
I mean, you never die, that's one thing you
do not know.

00:21:51.518 --> 00:21:56.961
He can be born again, he would be born in
such a condition where he'll be

00:21:56.986 --> 00:22:00.637
much more effective.

00:22:02.758 --> 00:22:07.248
He has himself died at the top of his glory.

00:22:07.248 --> 00:22:11.427
I mean for him, he's a martyr.

00:22:11.427 --> 00:22:17.478
If you see from his angle, everywhere in the
whole world, "Sadat."

00:22:17.478 --> 00:22:21.358
Sa-dat, it's a big name too.

00:22:22.368 --> 00:22:28.327
But supposing he had fallen in his glory and
all that, then he would have died, then God

00:22:28.327 --> 00:22:33.057
would not have been just to him, I would say.

00:22:33.057 --> 00:22:38.248
But he died in all his glory and he can be
born again.

00:22:38.248 --> 00:22:50.888
And he can take a position from where he can
do much better work, in the name of God, in

00:22:50.888 --> 00:22:56.020
the field of God because now we don't have
to do any more work,

00:22:56.045 --> 00:22:57.968
 otherwise in any other field.

00:22:57.968 --> 00:23:02.907
We have had enough of trains, we don't want
any more now.

00:23:02.907 --> 00:23:07.888
We have had enough of plastics, now we have
mountains.

00:23:07.888 --> 00:23:14.917
We have got too much of butter around, too
much of food, everything bit too much, I mean

00:23:14.917 --> 00:23:18.676
the house becomes a junk.

00:23:18.968 --> 00:23:21.783
In any field we have overdone things.

00:23:21.902 --> 00:23:24.378
We have exhausted this Mother Earth.

00:23:24.378 --> 00:23:27.088
Now what do we have to do?

00:23:27.088 --> 00:23:33.917
Only in one field and the field that is of
God's work you have to do it.

00:23:33.917 --> 00:23:38.308
But first you have to get connected and then
do the God's work.

00:23:38.308 --> 00:23:45.907
And that connection is only through your spirit,
when you become absolute and you have the

00:23:45.907 --> 00:23:51.687
truth within you as a built-in awareness.

00:23:51.687 --> 00:23:56.318
Is the awareness that becomes the truth.

00:23:56.318 --> 00:24:07.167
So the first quality of the spirit is that
you become the truth, that you know the truth,

00:24:07.167 --> 00:24:12.348
that you take a stand on the truth.

00:24:12.348 --> 00:24:14.297
Look at Christ.

00:24:14.297 --> 00:24:19.908
He had nothing to do with women like Mary
Magdalene, I mean, nothing to do, I mean,

00:24:19.908 --> 00:24:23.180
He was virtue.

00:24:26.197 --> 00:24:28.057
He was innocence.

00:24:28.057 --> 00:24:32.998
But when He saw people were stoning her, He
took up a stand.

00:24:32.998 --> 00:24:34.327
He took up a stand.

00:24:34.327 --> 00:24:39.118
You have to take up a stand, stand on the
truth.

00:24:39.118 --> 00:24:42.498
And he said, "Those who have not committed
any sin can throw,

00:24:42.523 --> 00:24:44.718
and you can throw the stone at Me".

00:24:44.718 --> 00:24:47.680
And nobody did.

00:24:49.038 --> 00:24:53.088
He did this because He was standing on the
truth.

00:24:53.088 --> 00:24:59.690
He took a whip and whipped those people who
were selling in the temple of God.

00:25:01.177 --> 00:25:10.218
At the age when he was a little boy, he went
and argued with learned people.

00:25:10.218 --> 00:25:13.258
Such people have no fear of anything.

00:25:13.258 --> 00:25:15.018
What is there to fear?

00:25:15.018 --> 00:25:18.968
When you are standing on the truth, what is
there to fear?

00:25:18.968 --> 00:25:28.498
Truth is such a light that it gives you complete
picture of the whole thing.

00:25:28.498 --> 00:25:31.776
There's nothing to fear.

00:25:31.988 --> 00:25:39.183
Your Father, He is compassion, He's ocean
of compassion.

00:25:40.389 --> 00:25:44.833
And He's ocean of love and ocean of forgiveness.

00:25:45.492 --> 00:25:51.178
And He is now within you.

00:25:51.917 --> 00:25:55.398
Who is more powerful than Him?

00:25:55.398 --> 00:25:58.988
It's very easy for many human beings to say,
"Oh, we don't believe in God."

00:25:58.988 --> 00:26:02.838
You believe it or not, He's there.

00:26:02.838 --> 00:26:09.248
Those who say, "We don't believe," it is better
that they should come and get their realization

00:26:09.248 --> 00:26:17.098
and understand that there is very little time
left for such kind of nonsensical statements.

00:26:17.098 --> 00:26:24.528
I mean you can at the most say that, "I've
not felt God so far and I'm open, if I feel."

00:26:24.528 --> 00:26:30.118
But on what basis do you deny?

00:26:30.118 --> 00:26:36.927
What basis have you got to say that, "We don't
believe in God"?

00:26:36.927 --> 00:26:45.077
Not only, after realization you can prove
God, but you can show His miracles.

00:26:45.077 --> 00:26:51.848
The second thing, the nature of Spirit is
that He's chitta, He's the attention.

00:26:51.848 --> 00:27:00.207
He's the attention means when you become spiritually
enlightened your attention becomes enlightened.

00:27:00.207 --> 00:27:07.158
Now enlightenment, what we understand of these
lights is that the lights are falling here,

00:27:07.158 --> 00:27:10.000
and we can see things, that's all.

00:27:10.215 --> 00:27:20.304
But this attention which is being enlightened,
acts, it works, it has got loops, it has got

00:27:20.329 --> 00:27:24.090
weapons, it works.

00:27:27.628 --> 00:27:35.718
You have to see for yourself how your attention
works.

00:27:35.718 --> 00:27:44.937
Today there was somebody who went and told
one of the Sahaj yginis that "I was sitting

00:27:44.937 --> 00:27:49.908
there and I was getting all negative thoughts
and was feeling horrible in my hands and I

00:27:49.908 --> 00:27:53.008
don't know why it was happening in the program."

00:27:53.008 --> 00:28:02.098
So she said, "Here you have come to pay attention
to Mother and to Her work and pay attention

00:28:02.098 --> 00:28:03.508
to your Spirit.

00:28:03.508 --> 00:28:07.478
But if you are paying attention to all the
rest of the people here,

00:28:07.503 --> 00:28:09.725
then you are going to catch them."

00:28:10.827 --> 00:28:15.379
Is a very simple thing, "Where is your attention?"

00:28:15.404 --> 00:28:16.681
Ask this question.

00:28:16.988 --> 00:28:20.807
This is a very common question in an Indian
home, a mother will ask the child,

00:28:20.832 --> 00:28:22.482
"Where is your attention?"

00:28:23.317 --> 00:28:32.728
The basis of Indian life is chitta nirodh,
is to fix your attention in a proper way.

00:28:32.728 --> 00:28:36.167
Where is your attention?

00:28:37.248 --> 00:28:39.393
Is it on your Spirit?

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:46.568
Or is it on somebody else, like, "My brother
is sitting here, my mother is sitting there,

00:28:46.568 --> 00:28:51.858
oh, that woman is very bad, she's jealous
of me," all this nonsense.

00:28:51.858 --> 00:28:55.228
Where is your attention?

00:28:55.228 --> 00:29:02.769
When you get realized then you start seeing
through the window of the Spirit,

00:29:02.794 --> 00:29:04.978
your position changes.

00:29:04.978 --> 00:29:14.047
As you're looking at Me now, then you come
back here and start looking at you this way.

00:29:14.047 --> 00:29:25.018
Till you are realized you are sitting before
Me, but once you are realized you come here

00:29:25.018 --> 00:29:30.162
and see others from there, that's your fort.

00:29:30.187 --> 00:29:33.318
Nobody can touch you there.

00:29:33.343 --> 00:29:38.897
From there you see others, your attention
is detached.

00:29:39.457 --> 00:29:46.168
So the attention becomes enlightened after
realization.

00:29:46.168 --> 00:29:48.673
You pay attention to anything, it works.

00:29:48.698 --> 00:29:52.038
It does work, no doubt, you try.

00:29:52.063 --> 00:29:57.827
Those who have got realization should try
this.

00:29:57.827 --> 00:30:03.248
Try your attention, but attention has to be
pure.

00:30:03.248 --> 00:30:09.599
You have to purify your attention, and the
best way to purify it

00:30:09.624 --> 00:30:12.978
is to keep your Agnya Chakra open.

00:30:12.978 --> 00:30:17.897
When this centre is open which is the centre
of Christ, which I have shown that it can

00:30:17.897 --> 00:30:23.327
only open through the Lord's Prayer after
realization.

00:30:25.524 --> 00:30:36.110
When you open that, then you are in that state
where your attention is divine.

00:30:36.579 --> 00:30:44.288
And you'll be amazed how things work out,
even the smallest things, the material things,

00:30:44.288 --> 00:30:50.805
the useless things and the great things, and
the subtle and subtlest,

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:53.350
and how you start growing.

00:30:54.658 --> 00:31:02.888
So the growth is to be achieved by purifying
your attention, and to purify this attention

00:31:02.888 --> 00:31:10.378
is to keep your Agnya Chakra open and be in
thoughtless awareness.

00:31:10.378 --> 00:31:13.519
You watch something, you don't think about
it.

00:31:13.544 --> 00:31:18.228
Zen said the same thing but I think people
didn't understand, you see, before realization

00:31:18.228 --> 00:31:21.390
it's like telling about colors to a blind
man.

00:31:21.699 --> 00:31:27.718
Zen said the same thing, you watch a thing
without thinking about it.

00:31:27.718 --> 00:31:33.047
They created patterns which didn't mean anything,
which you see it without thinking.

00:31:33.047 --> 00:31:37.031
But that's only possible after realization.

00:31:37.368 --> 00:31:43.380
So the thinking process minimizes and you
start witnessing.

00:31:44.268 --> 00:31:53.758
The higher state than that of attention is
that you jump into nirvikalpa samadhi, into

00:31:53.758 --> 00:31:57.612
the state of doubtless awareness.

00:31:57.723 --> 00:32:02.267
Now it is not doubtlessness because you've
argued it out or anything.

00:32:02.267 --> 00:32:07.827
But is a state where you're doubtless about
things.

00:32:07.827 --> 00:32:12.167
I mean the way you speak, the way you behave,
the way your attention is, you can make it

00:32:12.167 --> 00:32:16.883
out that "I'm doubtlessly there."

00:32:18.317 --> 00:32:25.067
The discrimination becomes so sharp that you
can just say, "This is so and so and so,"

00:32:25.067 --> 00:32:27.168
there's no fanaticism about it.

00:32:27.168 --> 00:32:36.028
As I told you this morning that if a blind
man cross over something and says, "Oh there's

00:32:36.028 --> 00:32:42.657
a snake here," and he believes it's a snake,
he believes that it's a snake, that's fanaticism.

00:32:42.682 --> 00:32:45.628
Because he has no eyes to see and he believes
it's a snake, he says,

00:32:45.653 --> 00:32:48.382
 "Oh, there is a snake here, I believe!"

00:32:49.478 --> 00:32:54.468
But a person who has eyes sees, "No it's a
rope, it's just a rope."

00:32:54.468 --> 00:32:57.358
And he says, "No, it's not, it's a rope."

00:32:57.358 --> 00:33:03.998
But he has eyes and when he says with his
eyes, which can see that, that it's a rope,

00:33:03.998 --> 00:33:09.297
he means it, the truth - then he's not a fanatic.

00:33:09.297 --> 00:33:11.608
But he's standing on the truth.

00:33:11.633 --> 00:33:15.833
This subtle difference people don't understand.

00:33:15.858 --> 00:33:28.051
Fanaticism comes through blindness and the
truth comes through realization.

00:33:28.687 --> 00:33:34.428
And at any cost you'll not give up the truth,
any cost.

00:33:34.428 --> 00:33:42.998
Now when I started My work in 1970, somehow
I knew all about these fake gurus and fake

00:33:42.998 --> 00:33:45.277
people, I knew about it.

00:33:45.277 --> 00:33:53.108
And in My first lecture, we had about, must
be having about two, three thousand people,

00:33:53.108 --> 00:34:01.608
it was a very huge hall and I told the names
of all these fake people and who they were

00:34:01.608 --> 00:34:06.108
in previous lives and what they did, by names.

00:34:06.108 --> 00:34:12.067
And everybody was amazed at Me, they were
frightened.

00:34:12.067 --> 00:34:16.047
There was a Maharajah who was a friend of
My husband and all that, and he came and told

00:34:16.047 --> 00:34:18.628
Me that, "Oh, I'm so...

00:34:18.628 --> 00:34:21.208
I'm very frightened for you."

00:34:21.208 --> 00:34:22.758
I said, "Why?"

00:34:22.758 --> 00:34:25.858
He said, "These people are horrid.

00:34:25.858 --> 00:34:33.248
They mean money, they mean their whole earnings
out of it.

00:34:33.248 --> 00:34:37.428
How did you say these things openly and you
took their names?

00:34:37.428 --> 00:34:38.608
They will shoot you."

00:34:38.608 --> 00:34:39.906
I said, "Let them shoot.

00:34:39.931 --> 00:34:42.061
I'll see who shoots Me."

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:49.776
They said, "You see they will prosecute you."

00:34:49.801 --> 00:34:51.867
I said, "Let them prosecute."

00:34:51.867 --> 00:35:01.187
So many years have passed, nobody has dared
to say that I'm telling the lies.

00:35:03.847 --> 00:35:06.888
There is no fear.

00:35:06.888 --> 00:35:13.279
You love, but you don't love satanic people,
you don't love Satan.

00:35:13.414 --> 00:35:20.188
The Satan who has spoiled the Kundalini of
people, who has spoiled all the chances of

00:35:20.188 --> 00:35:23.413
their getting realization, as a mother do
you think I should say,

00:35:23.438 --> 00:35:25.500
"They are very good people"?

00:35:25.525 --> 00:35:31.014
I'm not a political figure and I'm not seeking
elections.

00:35:32.197 --> 00:35:36.128
Cannot be a compromise!

00:35:36.398 --> 00:35:39.168
That's what happens to you also.

00:35:39.168 --> 00:35:53.082
But by your own self-esteem, by your own glory,
people see, "Here is the leader."

00:35:54.328 --> 00:35:58.461
And you become the leader of the people.

00:35:58.898 --> 00:36:05.374
You can, there is nothing to be frightened
of.

00:36:06.848 --> 00:36:14.428
There should be no half-way, as Christ, as
he read it out to you, that lukewarm people

00:36:14.428 --> 00:36:17.049
he spits them out of the mouth.

00:36:17.074 --> 00:36:25.158
If you are hot, if you are devils, we'll fight
you; if you are cold, you're my children.

00:36:25.183 --> 00:36:33.508
But lukewarm people are static, because all
kinds of forces are pulling, there's no progress

00:36:33.508 --> 00:36:34.718
of any kind.

00:36:34.718 --> 00:36:41.715
You come, you come, negative, positive, they
are pulled this way, that way.

00:36:43.178 --> 00:36:47.412
There cannot be compromise with truth.

00:36:48.048 --> 00:36:54.411
And then you will see you will have the real
collective force,

00:36:54.436 --> 00:37:01.428
the real blessings of God, in every way.

00:37:01.428 --> 00:37:06.489
You don't have to worry about money, you don't
have to worry about anything, it all works

00:37:06.514 --> 00:37:08.988
out, everything works out.

00:37:08.988 --> 00:37:13.251
You can't believe it how much it works out.

00:37:14.598 --> 00:37:21.958
I will tell you about these Australians: Australians
were finding it very difficult to get a place

00:37:21.958 --> 00:37:30.818
to have an ashram, and one day, frantically
one of the girls telephoned to Me, "Mother,

00:37:30.818 --> 00:37:34.908
we cannot have a place now, we don't know
where to go, we have sold our houses, we've

00:37:34.908 --> 00:37:36.118
no place to go to."

00:37:36.118 --> 00:37:38.694
I said, "Don't you worry, tomorrow, you'll
get it."

00:37:38.719 --> 00:37:43.638
And she was surprised how I told her, "Tomorrow
you'll get it."

00:37:43.638 --> 00:37:49.593
After telephoning and all that, she went home
and she received a call...

00:37:49.863 --> 00:37:58.127
I mean there was a call from a... estate agent.

00:37:58.152 --> 00:38:02.016
When they went to see him next day he said,
"There's an ashram available,

00:38:02.041 --> 00:38:03.666
would you like to have it?"

00:38:03.738 --> 00:38:09.190
At a very cheap rate, they got a beautiful
house for the ashram.

00:38:10.028 --> 00:38:15.688
In London, we had a some sort of a small ashram
and they were finding it very difficult for

00:38:15.688 --> 00:38:19.411
all these people to live there, because they
wanted to live together.

00:38:19.712 --> 00:38:24.608
They said, "Mother, we must have some more
rooms and some more place."

00:38:24.751 --> 00:38:27.718
I said, "All right you just pray, it will
work out."

00:38:27.718 --> 00:38:32.928
You won't believe, we had started a co-op
in London, and they said it will take eight

00:38:32.928 --> 00:38:35.445
years to get a room out of this co-op.

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:39.645
That's London speed, just the opposite of
American.

00:38:40.026 --> 00:38:48.881
And within a month's time, we got a huge house,
huge house with fifteen bedrooms and two big

00:38:48.906 --> 00:38:54.268
halls and we didn't know what to do with it,
and at such a cheap rate that for the whole

00:38:54.293 --> 00:38:58.482
week, only seventy pounds were to be paid.

00:38:58.774 --> 00:39:04.886
But then the Sahaj yogis went and settled
down there because in London we have in thousands.

00:39:04.911 --> 00:39:07.707
Then they said, "Mother what about for others?"

00:39:07.834 --> 00:39:18.878
And within fifteen days we got a huge big
hotel with all carpets and with all curtains

00:39:18.878 --> 00:39:26.968
and everything provided for, cutlery, crockery,
anything you say was there.

00:39:26.993 --> 00:39:37.638
Every thing - only for ninety pounds a week,
for at least twenty people to live very happily

00:39:37.638 --> 00:39:41.398
and big rooms each and big halls.

00:39:42.398 --> 00:39:45.178
Just we got it.

00:39:46.238 --> 00:39:50.598
You won't believe but it has happened just
before Warren's marriage and we didn't know

00:39:50.598 --> 00:39:55.048
where they are going to stay, all of these
who were coming to get married here, and they

00:39:55.048 --> 00:39:59.038
had a nice honeymoon in that hotel.

00:39:59.038 --> 00:40:01.594
They didn't have to pay anything for it.

00:40:02.794 --> 00:40:04.396
Yes, it works out.

00:40:04.421 --> 00:40:06.428
Krishna has said, "Yoga kshema vahamyaham."

00:40:06.428 --> 00:40:12.318
You get to your yoga first, he never said,
"Kshema yoga," he said, "Yoga kshema vahamyaham."

00:40:12.318 --> 00:40:16.286
You get your realization, you get your yoga
and then the kshema,

00:40:16.311 --> 00:40:19.087
 the well-being works out.

00:40:20.404 --> 00:40:26.868
Everything is organized then for you, you
are on the stage, everyone works for you,

00:40:26.868 --> 00:40:30.188
believe Me, it happens that way.

00:40:30.188 --> 00:40:35.188
What is there to hanker after, what is there
to ask for, I mean you ask for one thing,

00:40:35.188 --> 00:40:39.617
you get thousand, you don't know what to do
with them.

00:40:40.368 --> 00:40:45.484
I don't know really- I don't know with Myself,
I don't know what to do , the way, I'm quite

00:40:45.509 --> 00:40:53.078
generous, I mean I try to give away so many
things but still My house, oh God!

00:40:53.078 --> 00:40:56.461
You can't imagine, you can't imagine.

00:40:56.486 --> 00:41:01.205
In their wedding I gave fifty-one saris, fifty-one,
thinking that,

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:03.668
 "Now I'll some rest from these saris."

00:41:03.668 --> 00:41:06.612
Again I went back, they are still there.

00:41:06.637 --> 00:41:11.688
I don't know now what am I to do, I brought
now some to America to give away and all that,

00:41:11.688 --> 00:41:20.153
you just give and you get, everything, you
get fed-up!

00:41:21.298 --> 00:41:27.098
But only thing that I always, I have been
asking for are the seekers,

00:41:27.123 --> 00:41:30.186
where are they lost?

00:41:30.798 --> 00:41:33.506
Where are they?

00:41:33.838 --> 00:41:40.066
That's something still there, they are to
be saved.

00:41:40.698 --> 00:41:47.498
Because as I told you Christ is going to come
back with eleven destructive powers and there's

00:41:47.498 --> 00:41:54.158
going to be no questioning, no realization,
just...

00:41:55.171 --> 00:42:01.888
All the negative forces will be killed and
those who enter into the kingdom of God will

00:42:01.888 --> 00:42:14.018
reside in the kingdom of God, will reside
there, the residents, the citizens.

00:42:14.018 --> 00:42:21.698
As He said, "If you want money, I'll give
you gold.

00:42:21.698 --> 00:42:28.388
But I look after those who hanker after Spirit."

00:42:28.388 --> 00:42:36.348
You enter through the door and He eats with
you, He shares with you.

00:42:36.348 --> 00:42:44.328
For a realized soul the highest human beings
are the seekers.

00:42:44.328 --> 00:42:51.438
You may be any king or anything, what does
it matter, there are so many roaming about.

00:42:51.438 --> 00:42:58.418
But a seeker is the thing in the eyes of God
as the highest human being, who has to become

00:42:58.418 --> 00:43:00.498
a super-human being.

00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:13.498
So your attention is filled, so many of these
miracles, you cannot imagine how many have

00:43:13.498 --> 00:43:15.698
taken place with Sahaj yogis.

00:43:15.723 --> 00:43:19.317
One can write such a big book.

00:43:20.408 --> 00:43:24.429
So the attention becomes pure.

00:43:25.528 --> 00:43:30.398
You just can't see bad things happening, I
mean, you just don't like it, I mean, I feel

00:43:30.398 --> 00:43:34.438
like vomiting sometimes the way things are,
sometimes.

00:43:34.438 --> 00:43:44.688
The things that you enjoy normally become
absolutely garbage, you just don't like it,

00:43:44.688 --> 00:43:48.164
the whole, the priorities change.

00:43:49.228 --> 00:43:55.978
You become automatically virtuous, I don't
have to tell you, "Be virtuous," you'll just

00:43:55.978 --> 00:44:01.085
become, and you start enjoying your virtues
and virtues of others.

00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:09.558
You start enjoying other people because attention
becomes collectively conscious.

00:44:10.218 --> 00:44:17.088
Our central nervous system is our attention
but this central nervous system becomes collectively

00:44:17.088 --> 00:44:20.569
conscious, becomes.

00:44:24.228 --> 00:44:29.738
You are not bothered; somebody has cancer,
it's all right, "I'll try to cure you."

00:44:29.738 --> 00:44:34.218
You are not afraid you'll get cancer, nothing,
you are never afraid of it.

00:44:35.528 --> 00:44:37.043
"I'll try."

00:44:37.421 --> 00:44:41.261
You put your hands like this, like that and
the fellow says, "Oh I'm feeling very much

00:44:41.286 --> 00:44:44.734
better, I don't know, what have you done to
me?" "Nothing."

00:44:45.528 --> 00:44:55.258
The attention becomes so effective, so powerful;
it does tremendous things and the attention

00:44:55.258 --> 00:45:00.438
among yourselves has a rapport.

00:45:00.438 --> 00:45:10.274
They all move like the several drops in an
ocean, in a wave of love, it's so beautiful.

00:45:11.288 --> 00:45:19.728
The white men came to India long time back
as this or that, but when they came with Me,

00:45:19.728 --> 00:45:27.208
you should see, we have some films how the
Indian villagers, you see, took them to their

00:45:27.208 --> 00:45:34.978
heart, danced with them, fed them, loved them,
it's so sweet.

00:45:34.978 --> 00:45:41.714
And they write to them, it's so beautiful,
there's no artificial, it's not just a feeling,

00:45:41.739 --> 00:45:45.168
"I love you, you love me," it's not there.

00:45:45.168 --> 00:45:50.998
It's just the enjoyment of the company of
other realized souls.

00:45:50.998 --> 00:45:59.242
We talk of big things, "Oh, we are all brothers
and sisters," it's all talk, talk, talk, talk,

00:45:59.563 --> 00:46:06.128
Then you just become, you forget your color,
you forget your nationality, you forget everything,

00:46:06.128 --> 00:46:10.221
you just feel, "Oh, thats a Sahaj yogi."

00:46:11.758 --> 00:46:19.866
It's a very different plane into which you
arrive where you feel so happy, joyous, the

00:46:19.891 --> 00:46:22.840
whole thing is a fun.

00:46:23.248 --> 00:46:26.898
And when it comes to helping, all of them
come together.

00:46:26.898 --> 00:46:32.018
When they find a negative force is coming,
all of them come together.

00:46:32.018 --> 00:46:36.038
There is never a discussion among them, never.

00:46:36.038 --> 00:46:37.965
They try to pull him out.

00:46:38.037 --> 00:46:41.938
They tell him, all of them will tell by their
own ways and method that, "This is wrong,

00:46:41.938 --> 00:46:43.188
this is wrong."

00:46:43.636 --> 00:46:46.901
It's such a combination, I never have to tell
them.

00:46:46.926 --> 00:46:50.728
I don't have to tell them that, "I'll give
you some lessons now," for example, "How to

00:46:50.728 --> 00:46:54.868
carry on among yourselves," nothing, they
just manage.

00:46:54.868 --> 00:47:01.742
Not only that but a person will say, "Now
see," A will say to B, "See I'm catching on

00:47:01.767 --> 00:47:03.697
my Agnya, will you please help me there."

00:47:03.722 --> 00:47:05.678
That means, "I'm ego."

00:47:05.678 --> 00:47:07.842
And the other fellow he'll say, "I'll...

00:47:07.867 --> 00:47:08.867
I'll try."

00:47:09.328 --> 00:47:15.688
They just help each other, without feeling
bad, there is no remorse of anything, there's

00:47:15.688 --> 00:47:20.292
no heart burning, no jealousy.

00:47:21.048 --> 00:47:26.694
What a relationship is established like one
finger doesn't have jealousy with the other.

00:47:27.188 --> 00:47:33.355
You have no jealousies with the other cells
of the same primordial being.

00:47:34.298 --> 00:47:38.138
There is no need even to talk of love, you
are in love.

00:47:38.571 --> 00:47:41.650
Everybody can see that your love.

00:47:41.852 --> 00:47:54.760
It's really worth seeing how we become so
much adaptable, so much silent and happy people,

00:47:54.905 --> 00:48:01.753
when our attention becomes collectively conscious,
because that's the real source of joy.

00:48:04.503 --> 00:48:11.594
And the greatest quality of the Spirit is
that you're pure joy.

00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:13.490
It's pure joy.

00:48:13.764 --> 00:48:21.371
We talk of unhappiness and happiness, sorrow
and ecstasy and all these words.

00:48:21.516 --> 00:48:29.872
But joy is pure, it hasn't got the duality,
it's one, single, absolute.

00:48:31.198 --> 00:48:38.627
I'm leaving you and My heart is wrenching.

00:48:39.613 --> 00:48:43.776
The joy is seeing that.

00:48:45.248 --> 00:48:51.218
Seeing that this Nirmala is wrenching, bleeding.

00:48:54.726 --> 00:49:06.258
The joy is seeing and when I go, this feeling,
I will think and I'll think of you and the

00:49:06.258 --> 00:49:08.778
joy will be again repeated.

00:49:08.778 --> 00:49:16.747
That joy of oneness, even in separation the
oneness I feel it, the concern.

00:49:17.868 --> 00:49:29.633
Which cannot be expressed in words, that silent
pulling of your heart - that is also joy.

00:49:33.284 --> 00:49:38.960
Joy is absolute, it comes through seeing.

00:49:40.738 --> 00:49:47.378
You see it and you get the joy.

00:49:47.378 --> 00:49:56.619
Joy is the quality when you gradually move
from the brain, the attention first goes into

00:49:56.644 --> 00:50:02.494
the brain, specially in the West, is the brain
first, takes place, means you become the attention,

00:50:02.862 --> 00:50:05.600
I'm sorry, you become the truth.

00:50:05.816 --> 00:50:10.688
Means you start feeling in the hands, you
understand, then you see, "Yes, it is so and

00:50:10.688 --> 00:50:15.248
this person has got this trouble, so he must
be having arthritis if he's catching on this,

00:50:15.248 --> 00:50:16.248
yes true."

00:50:16.248 --> 00:50:22.618
You start tallying, finding out and monitoring
it and again, again verifying it and you are

00:50:22.618 --> 00:50:24.336
satisfied with it.

00:50:24.408 --> 00:50:36.728
So the attention first is nothing but starts
achieving the truth.

00:50:36.728 --> 00:50:48.548
It's trying to feel the truth but it's dry,
at that stage, it'sdry - in the West, specially,

00:50:48.548 --> 00:50:52.985
because we are differently made in the West.

00:50:53.843 --> 00:50:58.128
Then we read the book, "Advent," we like it
and we see all these things and knowledge

00:50:58.128 --> 00:51:03.758
and everything you like, you want to listen
to the t- My speech and all that.

00:51:03.758 --> 00:51:06.764
You all like it.

00:51:06.789 --> 00:51:14.648
Is the knowledge because you see the truth,
the knowledge - that's the gift of the brain.

00:51:15.942 --> 00:51:19.870
Is the central path as I can say "the awareness."

00:51:20.436 --> 00:51:26.567
Then you feel your chitta, your attention
which is enlightened,

00:51:26.592 --> 00:51:28.516
and you're blasted with it.

00:51:28.638 --> 00:51:33.556
You see the miracles happening, "That's happening..."
you are just blasted.

00:51:34.368 --> 00:51:42.826
Then the third thing happens; is the joy:
that you are in joy all the time.

00:51:43.208 --> 00:51:53.718
You cannot keep serious for more than two
minutes; it's very difficult to keep serious.

00:51:54.518 --> 00:52:02.338
The sense of humor is so beautiful, you never
use vulgarity or hurting things or personal

00:52:02.338 --> 00:52:06.196
remarks, but the whole thing is so beautiful.

00:52:06.518 --> 00:52:17.270
When you speak, people feel the flowers throwing
their fragrance at you.

00:52:17.688 --> 00:52:23.238
Every action that you do creates joy, ripple
of joy.

00:52:23.238 --> 00:52:32.628
Every movement you do, every vision you see,
gives you joy.

00:52:32.628 --> 00:52:37.601
That time you feel perfected.

00:52:38.408 --> 00:52:46.248
When you see a picture which is beautiful,
immediately you go into thoughtless awareness,

00:52:46.248 --> 00:52:53.458
and the complete joy of that creation starts
dropping on you, you just feel the joy.

00:52:53.458 --> 00:53:05.853
Then you become silent, you don't speak...
much, you don't think, you become the joy,

00:53:05.878 --> 00:53:07.908
ananda.

00:53:10.198 --> 00:53:16.592
That's the perfect state in which you should
be.

00:53:17.348 --> 00:53:23.671
It's so beautiful that you want to be there
all the time.

00:53:24.458 --> 00:53:39.049
This joy is the movement of your ocean of
love.

00:53:39.498 --> 00:53:49.197
Is the beautiful movement of the clouds that
you see.

00:53:51.708 --> 00:54:00.368
It's fantastic, you just get drenched into
it and you do everything for love's sake and

00:54:00.368 --> 00:54:05.613
you don't think you're doing it for love's
sake, you do not feel that way,

00:54:05.638 --> 00:54:10.968
you just do it because it's so joy-giving, 
that it is the greatest thing.

00:54:10.968 --> 00:54:17.618
You may have... anything in the world will
not be that much joy-giving as this joy of

00:54:17.618 --> 00:54:20.288
the Spirit which you become.

00:54:20.638 --> 00:54:25.334
You never feel lonely, you are never bored.

00:54:25.983 --> 00:54:32.838
Whether you are alone or with anyone, you
are in joy.

00:54:32.838 --> 00:54:38.978
One should understand that if you get your
Self-realization or if somebody says that

00:54:38.978 --> 00:54:43.758
they are giving you to some positive lines,
you should know,

00:54:43.783 --> 00:54:46.427
"Are you peaceful within you?

00:54:49.518 --> 00:54:51.735
Are you joy?"

00:54:51.785 --> 00:54:59.220
Forget about the collective consciousness,
is your health all right?

00:54:59.878 --> 00:55:02.774
That's the minimum of minimum.

00:55:03.908 --> 00:55:07.649
The whole system changes.

00:55:09.773 --> 00:55:15.077
I just say that all of you should achieve
that state of joy

00:55:15.102 --> 00:55:17.732
by the time I come here next year.

00:55:20.208 --> 00:55:28.438
And I hope you grow into it, by taking up
a stand on the truth, grow into it.

00:55:28.438 --> 00:55:31.540
You progress into it.

00:55:33.048 --> 00:55:40.823
It's so wonderful and so beautiful and that's
what your Father wants you to have.

00:55:41.075 --> 00:55:47.463
He's the most generous Father; He can't enjoy
His kingdom unless and until He has given

00:55:47.488 --> 00:55:51.918
it to you, that He has made you sit on His
throne.

00:55:52.163 --> 00:56:00.428
That's the greatest joy that He wants to have
and that's what you should achieve, that's

00:56:00.428 --> 00:56:05.868
what you should have, that's your right to
have.

00:56:08.118 --> 00:56:16.174
This is what is Self-realization - you become
just the master.

00:56:17.208 --> 00:56:21.632
You don't have to consult anyone, you know
it.

00:56:23.553 --> 00:56:32.653
You have to just consult your Spirit through
your vibratory awareness, and you know it.

00:56:35.788 --> 00:56:43.018
These are the blessings of Self-realization
into which you have to grow and as you grow

00:56:43.018 --> 00:56:50.468
you start manifesting your powers: you can
raise the Kundalini, you can give realization

00:56:50.468 --> 00:56:53.868
at the very outset.

00:56:53.868 --> 00:56:56.909
Imagine the Kundalini moves under your finger,

00:56:56.934 --> 00:56:59.685
nobody can believe it but it has happened now.

00:57:00.733 --> 00:57:07.510
Even very, very great saints, you see, there
is a very great saint who is more than hundred

00:57:07.535 --> 00:57:15.178
and eight years of age, and he asked Me, "Mother,
I have spent thousands of years to get these

00:57:15.178 --> 00:57:20.095
vibrations and these people have got it without
doing anything."

00:57:20.751 --> 00:57:22.451
I said, "What did you...

00:57:22.476 --> 00:57:24.338
why did you do it, who asked you to do it?

00:57:24.338 --> 00:57:27.610
You should have taken it easy, you would have
got it."

00:57:29.832 --> 00:57:36.358
He's a very sweet fellow, but because he's
got it through his effort, see he has that

00:57:36.358 --> 00:57:38.528
feeling that, "I've got it through my effort."

00:57:38.528 --> 00:57:40.838
You'll never get it through effort, I tell
you.

00:57:40.838 --> 00:57:44.258
When you are finished with your effort you
just get it...

00:57:44.258 --> 00:57:46.978
[murmurs of laughter from the Audience.]

00:57:46.978 --> 00:57:49.860
Shri Mataji: ...maybe in an abstract way,
or maybe-

00:57:49.885 --> 00:57:50.885
Yes!

00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:58.400
When Buddha was tired, finished, fagged-out,
then he got his realization.

00:57:59.548 --> 00:58:03.308
When you stop your efforts then only you will
get your realization.

00:58:03.387 --> 00:58:06.278
"So why to boast of your efforts?"

00:58:06.278 --> 00:58:08.378
I told him.

00:58:08.378 --> 00:58:15.108
He's a very powerful man because he's done
lots of things and he always goes on a big,

00:58:15.108 --> 00:58:22.968
very big tiger and because he's hurt himself,
he says that people have beaten him, so he's

00:58:22.968 --> 00:58:29.842
hurt himself so he always uses a tiger.

00:58:30.152 --> 00:58:34.978
And he's a man with the idea that he has these
powers, that powers.

00:58:34.978 --> 00:58:39.608
So when I went to see him, I knew that time
because he told people that, "Mother has come,

00:58:39.608 --> 00:58:44.048
so you go and see Her..." and all that and
I knew he was there so I went to see him.

00:58:44.048 --> 00:58:50.928
When I went to see him, we had to climb about
three miles, one had to walk up, and I was

00:58:50.928 --> 00:58:56.528
walking up and when I reached there it was
raining and I got completely drenched.

00:58:56.528 --> 00:59:01.798
And this fellow is supposed have powers over
the rain.

00:59:01.798 --> 00:59:09.929
And he was so angry when I went there he was
sitting on a little seat of his

00:59:09.954 --> 00:59:11.657
made of some   stone.

00:59:11.682 --> 00:59:14.228
He was doing like this, like this, very angry.

00:59:14.228 --> 00:59:20.632
So I didn't say anything, I went inside his
cave and sat down there in that drenched condition.

00:59:20.719 --> 00:59:28.626
So he came down and he said, "Mother, did
you do this to kill my ego?"

00:59:28.651 --> 00:59:29.651
I said, "What?

00:59:29.651 --> 00:59:31.052
I didn't do anything.

00:59:31.077 --> 00:59:33.077
What did I do?"

00:59:33.102 --> 00:59:36.721
He said, "This rain wouldn't listen to me."

00:59:36.721 --> 00:59:40.949
I said, "Now, don't be angry," I said, "Sit
down.

00:59:40.974 --> 00:59:47.126
Haven't you bought a sari for Me, and you
are a sanyasi, I won't take a sari from a

00:59:47.151 --> 00:59:48.151
sanyasi, [son?].

00:59:48.176 --> 00:59:50.727
You have got a sari for Me, isn't it?

00:59:50.752 --> 00:59:54.444
So I have to get drenched, otherwise I will
not take sari from you."

00:59:54.661 --> 01:00:00.841
And the whole temper melted away, whole temper
melted away.

01:00:00.841 --> 01:00:07.381
Then I said, "It was necessary the water to
flow over My body so that all the plains around

01:00:07.381 --> 01:00:13.456
you becomes beautiful, is vibrated with water."

01:00:13.481 --> 01:00:18.658
But he is a very great soul I must say, because
he doesn't talk to Me

01:00:18.683 --> 01:00:21.481
 like ordinary human beings talk.

01:00:21.481 --> 01:00:27.839
His style is different because he recognizes,
he knows who I am.

01:00:28.019 --> 01:00:35.712
Is a very different thing, and a day will
come when you will also rise, you will rise

01:00:35.737 --> 01:00:49.611
and grow and grow and there will see the glory
of this great new age, new generation... into

01:00:49.636 --> 01:00:54.960
the complete newness of the being.

01:00:55.819 --> 01:01:01.781
Today I was going to tell you about certain
diseases that one has and how to control them

01:01:01.781 --> 01:01:09.771
and I would suggest that we have a book - are
you going to sell it to everyone?

01:01:09.771 --> 01:01:12.621
Yogi from the side: There's a few of them
Mother.

01:01:12.621 --> 01:01:15.372
Shri Mataji: We don't have many.

01:01:15.397 --> 01:01:20.897
So we would say those who have been coming
for all the four lectures should buy the book.

01:01:21.056 --> 01:01:29.162
We are sorry we don't have many books but
we hope to send you these books later on and

01:01:29.187 --> 01:01:35.551
is a very good book in which you can see what
imbalances can work out, like how you get

01:01:35.601 --> 01:01:41.141
diabetes, how you get kidney trouble, blood
pressure and then how you have to balance

01:01:41.141 --> 01:01:50.244
your liver, and how to look after the security
and all these things

01:01:50.276 --> 01:01:52.849
are written in that book at length.

01:01:53.096 --> 01:01:56.803
Quite a knowledgeable book I should say.

01:01:56.828 --> 01:02:02.258
I took the writer...

01:02:02.309 --> 01:02:05.439
I should say I really tortured him.

01:02:05.475 --> 01:02:12.333
And everyday I used to see him coming up pulling
his ears, you see, that, "I don't know what

01:02:12.358 --> 01:02:13.985
mistakes I'm going to do."

01:02:14.046 --> 01:02:21.251
And every time he would come, I would say,
"Now, Gregoire you have to be sweet as well.

01:02:21.251 --> 01:02:26.408
It's not that sweet, you are still a scholar,
you have to be a Sahaj yogi.

01:02:26.436 --> 01:02:32.551
And a Sahaj yogi is different from a scholar
so you write this book in such a manner, in

01:02:32.551 --> 01:02:41.781
such a way that it is sweet, it's loving,
it's kind," and I've tried really to curb

01:02:41.781 --> 01:02:44.227
it down, curb it down.

01:02:44.357 --> 01:02:53.362
But he had written two chapters of his scholarliness,
all the scholarliness that he had, and it

01:02:53.362 --> 01:03:00.397
was like a... really a big boulder before
you when you enter into that book.

01:03:00.422 --> 01:03:02.281
So one day I told him.

01:03:02.281 --> 01:03:08.250
"These two chapters, let us put it at the
end of the book," and he really collapsed.

01:03:08.885 --> 01:03:13.487
He said, "Mother, how can You do that to me,
it's too much."

01:03:13.512 --> 01:03:15.911
I said, "But why, what's the problem?"

01:03:15.936 --> 01:03:20.560
He said, "These two chapters are the ones
which introduce the book and

01:03:20.585 --> 01:03:22.090
how can we do it?

01:03:22.115 --> 01:03:25.083
I mean, it's in the beginning and how can
You put it at the end?"

01:03:25.119 --> 01:03:31.261
I said, "Gregoire, while correcting the book,
I saw to it that these chapters have nothing

01:03:31.261 --> 01:03:39.315
to do with the beginning, so you put them
at the end."

01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:44.114
And he, when he placed them there he said,
"Oh the book has become wonderful."

01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:49.491
And then he told Me, "It's a very good play
of Mother in this, that the intellectuals

01:03:49.491 --> 01:03:56.091
are never satisfied with the reading once,
and they would like to go into the intellectual

01:03:56.091 --> 01:03:58.016
rumination.

01:03:58.041 --> 01:04:04.421
Like the animals you see, like cows when they
eat, then they take it back and again eat

01:04:04.421 --> 01:04:08.855
it, like that, So is better to put these two
chapters for them."

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:11.201
I said, "Now you are not angry with Me?"

01:04:11.201 --> 01:04:13.083
He said, "No, this is a very good thing."

01:04:13.108 --> 01:04:18.493
But these two chapters definitely prove that
he's a very learned man.

01:04:18.518 --> 01:04:22.341
And I told him, "Gregoire, when did you read
all these books that you have quoted?"

01:04:22.341 --> 01:04:26.890
He said, "Mother, you'll be surprised, these
quotations just came to me...

01:04:26.890 --> 01:04:28.763
I never, I never read them."

01:04:28.788 --> 01:04:30.201
I said, "You never read them?"

01:04:30.201 --> 01:04:35.221
"Yes, yes, I had read them before, sometimes
I must have read them, but at the right time,

01:04:35.221 --> 01:04:38.758
I got the right quotation."

01:04:38.783 --> 01:04:45.781
He's now coming to Los Angeles, he is a diplomat
in the Swiss government and he's coming all

01:04:45.781 --> 01:04:55.314
the way from Rome to Los Angeles, and he's
a very dynamic person, I'm looking forward

01:04:55.339 --> 01:04:56.971
to My visit to Los Angeles.

01:04:56.971 --> 01:05:03.811
If you have any friends there or anything
you can write to them, you can take the address

01:05:03.811 --> 01:05:06.371
from here so that they can come and see Me.

01:05:06.371 --> 01:05:12.391
We have now booked all our days, I am sorry
and still we'll contact somebody from Unity

01:05:12.391 --> 01:05:14.931
Church, but all the days are booked.

01:05:14.931 --> 01:05:22.034
It's all right, and the people can come in
any case wherever you have the programs.

01:05:22.077 --> 01:05:26.336
Anything else you want you can write to Me.

01:05:26.365 --> 01:05:34.421
I'm sorry I can't write to you because every
day I work, like this the way I've been working

01:05:34.421 --> 01:05:40.541
here: morning, the workshop, evening, the
lecture.

01:05:40.566 --> 01:05:44.411
It has been on and on for years together now.

01:05:44.436 --> 01:05:50.339
So, I do write sometimes, but I don't have
so much time, but somebody will answer you.

01:05:50.364 --> 01:05:55.929
Any question, any problem, anything, please
write to Me.

01:05:56.030 --> 01:06:03.051
I'll be very happy to receive letters from
you and there are so many people who are sorting

01:06:03.051 --> 01:06:08.431
them out and looking after it, so you will
have an answer no doubt.

01:06:08.431 --> 01:06:14.252
Please get My address also from the ashram
address from these people.

01:06:14.277 --> 01:06:18.610
Anything that you want you can ask for it.

01:06:18.635 --> 01:06:24.026
Even sitting down here I know your attention,
it will work out.

01:06:24.127 --> 01:06:31.727
Gradually you will change and your asking
will be different and different and different.

01:06:31.771 --> 01:06:43.429
May God bless you to blossom into the beauties
of your Spirit, so that you glorify your Father

01:06:43.454 --> 01:06:51.675
and He feels glorified with His gracious love
towards you.

01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:55.672
Thank you very much.

01:06:57.156 --> 01:07:01.532
Today, if you want you can just put your hands,
if you had

01:07:01.557 --> 01:07:04.144
 put your hands you would have got the vibrations.

01:07:04.169 --> 01:07:14.391
I am sure there are some new people today
and they should also feel their vibrations

01:07:14.391 --> 01:07:18.581
on top of their heads; they might be feeling
already the Cool Breeze, just take out your

01:07:18.581 --> 01:07:22.896
shoes and you'll feel it.

01:07:22.921 --> 01:07:33.414
On top of your head.

01:07:33.565 --> 01:07:39.719
The tapes are with the Unity Church here,
you can buy them.

01:07:39.784 --> 01:07:42.231
We have also sending twenty one tapes.

01:07:42.231 --> 01:07:44.481
[Warren next to Shri Mataji]: They're already
being copied.

01:07:44.481 --> 01:07:46.206
[Shri Mataji]: They are being copied.

01:07:46.231 --> 01:07:56.201
We have so many tapes in London and you can
buy from the gentleman, we don't have to bother

01:07:56.201 --> 01:07:58.991
about money part, I mean, we are not bothered.

01:07:58.991 --> 01:08:05.811
Only thing, as he must, they must have told
you, a little problem with our trustees, that

01:08:05.811 --> 01:08:08.531
you have to just say that we have the copyright,
that's all.

01:08:08.531 --> 01:08:12.699
We are not bothered as to what you charge
and what you do it.

01:08:12.724 --> 01:08:16.891
So you can buy the tapes as you like and you
can listen to them

01:08:16.916 --> 01:08:19.921
and enjoy them.

01:08:23.077 --> 01:08:26.751
How many have come for the first time today?

01:08:26.751 --> 01:08:30.151
[Warren whispers]: Quite a few.

01:08:30.151 --> 01:08:34.120
[Shri Mataji]: Now just take out your shoes
please.
