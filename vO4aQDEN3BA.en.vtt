00:00:07.071 --> 00:00:09.018
I think let us meditate today.

00:00:09.138 --> 00:00:13.467
Maybe this meditation will help us. Please close your eyes.

00:00:14.203 --> 00:00:16.323
(break in recording)

00:00:22.341 --> 00:00:24.978
..all of you, these things, put it on the fire.

00:00:27.237 --> 00:00:34.403
Douglas [Fry], take these two, these things, and take them on the fire.

00:00:34.823 --> 00:00:39.178
(break in recording)

00:00:39.298 --> 00:00:44.738
…without paying attention here or there or without worrying.

00:00:45.484 --> 00:00:50.419
Worry and all these things are vikshepas, are all confusions, comes from confusion.

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:56.419
You have known about me that I can sit for nine hours in one pose.

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.939
I mean I have done that but I can do even more.

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:08.317
So one has to develop a baithak, is a sitting posture, for some time.

00:01:08.438 --> 00:01:11.610
You must settle down in some position. Alright?

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.213
Should try to do that, and whatever is required for that is to be done

00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:20.201
 because that’s the only way you can do it.

00:01:20.321 --> 00:01:24.672
If you are walking, still your attention will be moving about.

00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:29.249
Anyway, if there’s a movement then the time, space comes into play.

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.344
But if you can settle down, if you can have a place where you can sit down.

00:01:35.465 --> 00:01:37.197
And that’s why the photograph helps.

00:01:37.318 --> 00:01:40.495
If you can see the photograph continuously,

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.529
with a relaxed eyes, not all the time staring but relaxed eyes.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.919
You can close your eyes with respect [then] again you can open your eyes.

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.891
This settling down of the position

00:01:51.011 --> 00:01:53.653
– you will be surprised how your attention will

00:01:53.774 --> 00:01:56.681
gradually rise, you will feel it.

00:01:58.529 --> 00:02:01.717
Just now you are all in thoughtless awareness so go into meditation.

00:02:01.837 --> 00:02:05.397
No, if you cannot sit you can take a seat, you see, down below.

00:02:05.518 --> 00:02:10.360
But as I said it, clothes should be a little lighter.

00:02:10.481 --> 00:02:14.461
Alright, put your hands towards me. You have to sit for about now, five minutes.

00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:16.484
I will not make you [sit] much.

00:02:16.604 --> 00:02:21.103
But I hope you will develop it next time your sitting.

00:04:03.265 --> 00:04:06.129
Right hand on the heart I think will help. Right hand on the heart.

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:11.068
Now do it with your heart. Do – it – with – your – heart.

00:04:12.743 --> 00:04:15.668
Right hand on the heart.

00:04:29.485 --> 00:04:35.531
Think within that, “I am the Eternal Life, I am the Spirit”

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:59.056
Hold your breath.

00:05:00.276 --> 00:05:05.756
Leave it.

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:12.721
This time when you hold your breath you should know that I am the Mother of the Universe

00:05:12.842 --> 00:05:18.040
and the most powerful personality.

00:05:19.557 --> 00:05:23.552
And I am your Mother and you are all protected.

00:05:23.673 --> 00:05:26.542
Hold your breath.

00:05:32.091 --> 00:05:34.508
Haa! Leave it.

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:53.876
Good.

00:05:53.996 --> 00:05:56.853
You are still children I must say.

00:05:56.974 --> 00:05:58.862
Don’t you know that I’m very powerful?

00:05:58.983 --> 00:06:01.014
Have I to tell you?

00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:03.873
Even the small children know that.

00:06:16.156 --> 00:06:17.785
Alright?

00:06:27.601 --> 00:06:29.968
Relax.
