00:07.071 --> 00:09.018
I think let us meditate today.

00:09.138 --> 00:13.467
Maybe this meditation will help us. Please close your eyes.

00:14.203 --> 00:16.323
(break in recording)

00:22.341 --> 00:24.978
..all of you, these things, put it on the fire.

00:27.237 --> 00:34.403
Douglas [Fry], take these two, these things, and take them on the fire.

00:34.823 --> 00:39.178
(break in recording)

00:39.298 --> 00:44.738
…without paying attention here or there or without worrying.

00:45.484 --> 00:50.419
Worry and all these things are vikshepas, are all confusions, comes from confusion.

00:50.539 --> 00:56.419
You have known about me that I can sit for nine hours in one pose.

00:56.539 --> 00:59.939
I mean I have done that but I can do even more.

01:00.059 --> 01:08.317
So one has to develop a baithak, is a sitting posture, for some time.

01:08.438 --> 01:11.610
You must settle down in some position. Alright?

01:11.730 --> 01:17.213
Should try to do that, and whatever is required for that is to be done

01:17.333 --> 01:20.201
because that’s the only way you can do it.

01:20.321 --> 01:24.672
If you are walking, still your attention will be moving about.

01:24.793 --> 01:29.249
Anyway, if there’s a movement then the time, space comes into play.

01:29.369 --> 01:35.344
But if you can settle down, if you can have a place where you can sit down.

01:35.465 --> 01:37.197
And that’s why the photograph helps.

01:37.318 --> 01:40.495
If you can see the photograph continuously,

01:41.110 --> 01:44.529
with a relaxed eyes, not all the time staring but relaxed eyes.

01:44.650 --> 01:47.919
You can close your eyes with respect [then] again you can open your eyes.

01:48.039 --> 01:50.891
This settling down of the position

01:51.011 --> 01:53.653
– you will be surprised how your attention will

01:53.774 --> 01:56.681
gradually rise, you will feel it.

01:58.529 --> 02:01.717
Just now you are all in thoughtless awareness so go into meditation.

02:01.837 --> 02:05.397
No, if you cannot sit you can take a seat, you see, down below.

02:05.518 --> 02:10.360
But as I said it, clothes should be a little lighter.

02:10.481 --> 02:14.461
Alright, put your hands towards me. You have to sit for about now, five minutes.

02:14.581 --> 02:16.484
I will not make you [sit] much.

02:16.604 --> 02:21.103
But I hope you will develop it next time your sitting.

04:03.265 --> 04:06.129
Right hand on the heart I think will help. Right hand on the heart.

04:06.249 --> 04:11.068
Now do it with your heart. Do – it – with – your – heart.

04:12.743 --> 04:15.668
Right hand on the heart.

04:29.485 --> 04:35.531
Think within that, “I am the Eternal Life, I am the Spirit”

04:52.250 --> 04:59.056
Hold your breath.

05:00.276 --> 05:05.756
Leave it.

05:06.473 --> 05:12.721
This time when you hold your breath you should know that I am the Mother of the Universe

05:12.842 --> 05:18.040
and the most powerful personality.

05:19.557 --> 05:23.552
And I am your Mother and you are all protected.

05:23.673 --> 05:26.542
Hold your breath.

05:32.091 --> 05:34.508
Haa! Leave it.

05:51.369 --> 05:53.876
Good.

05:53.996 --> 05:56.853
You are still children I must say.

05:56.974 --> 05:58.862
Don’t you know that I’m very powerful?

05:58.983 --> 06:01.014
Have I to tell you?

06:01.269 --> 06:03.873
Even the small children know that.

06:16.156 --> 06:17.785
Alright?

06:27.601 --> 06:29.968
Relax.
