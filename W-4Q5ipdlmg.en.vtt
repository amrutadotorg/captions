00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.342
There’s lot of space.

00:00:05.342 --> 00:00:05.366
Ask, these girls others.

00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:05.387
Please, come forward.

00:00:05.387 --> 00:00:31.117
There’s lot of space.

00:00:31.116 --> 00:00:35.356
You all can come here.

00:00:35.356 --> 00:00:36.320
I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.840
very happy to see so many of you are here

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.920
and that Sahaja Yoga is growing so fast,

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.680
it’s something very, very satisfying.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.680
Welcome.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.840
Also in Hong Kong and Taipei.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.840
I was so very happy to meet&nbsp;
people of different communities,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.200
following different religions,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.080
coming to Sahaja Yoga and&nbsp;
unite together in a big way.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.240
It was really so satisfying.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.000
What we need now is unity and also peace.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.600
If our children have to grow properly,

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.400
first thing you should have, is peace.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.080
But there is so much of violence,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.840
so much of distraction for children.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.640
And if you see the world around,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.640
you’d be shocked how things are happening.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.840
Especially with this American democracy,

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.880
I don’t know what they are doing.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.760
The children are killing the parents,

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.520
the parents are killing the children,

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.440
all kinds of things.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.400
Not only violence but immoral,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.840
extremely immoral.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.400
Now we have to understand&nbsp;
that we must have self-respect

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.160
and we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.320
That’s why we have our own culture in Sahaja Yoga,

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.840
culture of purity and innocence and love.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.840
And I am so very happy that you&nbsp;
are here now in Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.840
I’ve been coming here so many times,

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.640
so many years.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.360
But I’m very happy to see all of you here.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.640
First of all, it’s important,

00:02:51.640 --> 00:03:04.000
we should see what we have to achieve.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.960
Very important.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.280
You should have the full Self-knowledge.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:19.440
And after that, we can look after people,

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.520
we can give them Realization.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.760
We are all very capable, all&nbsp;
over the world, I have seen.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.840
In some places, somehow, it works slowly,

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.000
and in some places it works very fast.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.280
Like in Russia, imagine, just like fire!

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.240
Posturing there, in one place in Togliatti,

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:51.040
we have 21,000 Sahaja Yogis, in one place.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.560
And here I’ve been coming&nbsp;
since long, to Kuala Lumpur,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.720
I don’t know how many years.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.560
And what we see is, slowly people are [coming].

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.840
I can’t say why,

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:18.800
but it’s very difficult to&nbsp;
understand why not, do Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.240
Also, they come but they would not meditate,

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.520
they would not come to collective.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:30.120
It’s very sad [unsure], as&nbsp;
if something is missing.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.000
For Russians, it’s so easy, I mean,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.480
they just got surrendered to it, absolutely.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.840
They’re so great.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.747
I mean,

00:04:38.747 --> 00:04:38.893
[Shri Mataji is laughing]

00:04:38.893 --> 00:04:40.880
there’s a joke.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.600
They had called us for a Diwali Puja.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.000
So many Americans also came,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.760
all those Sahaja Yogis were there.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.280
So she – the joke is like this that,

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.760
one of the Russians asked, you see,&nbsp;
from Togliatti, to an American,

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.920
“How many Sahaja Yogis you are in America?”

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.120
So he said, “We are 56”.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.920
“Oh my God, there are 56,000.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:20.639
We are 21, only 21,000 in Togliatti”.

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:20.655
Can you imagine?

00:05:20.655 --> 00:05:20.680
[Shri Mataji is laughing]

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.800
But once you settle down in Sahaja Yoga properly,

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.160
then others will see you,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.160
and you will be very much impressed by you.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.320
Because you’ll have that peace,

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.560
you’ll have that joy.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:45.720
Also you will have, we can say, that personality,

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.920
that people will be surprised,

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.720
“Look at them, how are they?

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.400
How can they be like this?”

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.320
And this is what we have to work out.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.520
It’s not difficult, I can tell you,

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.360
but collectivity is very important.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.320
If you are not collective, it doesn’t work out.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:17.120
We have to understand that collectivity&nbsp;
is a very important part of Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.880
I’m sure it will come up

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.320
and you will come up also very well.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.240
I wanted you all to come to Ganapatipule.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.880
Also, they have reduced the price and&nbsp;
all that for Ganapatipule very much.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.040
Because if you do the whole&nbsp;
Tour, then it’s difficult,

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.560
because quite a lot has to be paid, you see.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.840
But otherwise, only if you&nbsp;
are coming to Ganapatipule,

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.960
it’s much cheaper.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:50.240
Everybody can afford it, it’s not so much.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.280
Because if you are coming all the way,

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.200
then we have to pay for the&nbsp;
buses, for the trains, you know,

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.120
various places.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.280
This time specially, they went to jungles

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:07.280
and they had to go on taxis&nbsp;
because buses were not available.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.600
So it turns out to be very expensive, that part.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.040
But Ganapatipule is all right,

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.840
about, I think it is ten&nbsp;
days you have to take leave.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.760
Whatever suits you, please try to come,

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.000
because then the collectivity is much more.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.440
Some people went to Calcutta.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:31.240
Did anybody go to Calcutta for My birthday? No.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.400
And they were telling Me that, “We just got lost.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.120
We didn’t know where we were.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.920
Such an enjoyment, such happiness!

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.840
We didn’t know where we were.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.000
We were just lost in the joy of meeting everyone

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.200
from all over the world”.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.120
They have made very good arrangements also,

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.520
very good people [unclear].

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.960
And they did very well.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:59.440
I must say, even the Germans were surprised

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:08.280
the way they organized&nbsp;
everything, every bit of it.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.720
Meeting the collective only,&nbsp;
you grow, I have seen it.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.260
In your own collective,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.240
then renew [unsure] some or other,

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.680
try to meet the global collective also.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.280
So, you know all your brothers&nbsp;
and sisters all over the world.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.360
It’s nice to have all the&nbsp;
connections with all of them.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.756
So, you feel very confident about Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:31.756 --> 00:08:35.120
And they are so happy, all of them.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.480
It is some sort of a tremendous joy

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.160
of meeting somebody who is your own.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.040
It’s like this.

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:46.760
We had one Muslim, Djamel,

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.480
and they wanted to go to Hajj.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:53.000
So, he told his parents, “Why do&nbsp;
you want to go for Hajj to Mecca?

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.800
Mecca is now in London.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.840
So, you go there and you meet Mother”.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.240
So, the parents came there and met Me.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.760
And they said, “You are Mecca”.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.760
I said, “All right, whatever you say. I agree”.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.880
But the Muslims are difficult, that way.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.400
Djamel and all that, all of them,

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.720
all those Muslims are in Paris or somewhere else.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.307
So, they have joined Sahaja Yoga

00:09:18.307 --> 00:09:20.680
and they are very powerful Sahaja Yogis.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.680
They have Hamid, Akbar, all of them.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:29.040
But the best part of it, this time,&nbsp;
I met somebody very important.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.520
His name was Rohani Ayatollah.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.400
And he is one of the Ayatollahs, five Ayatollahs,

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:40.920
one of them was killed, you&nbsp;
see, he died, four are left.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:46.480
So, he came to see Me in the ashram [in Paris].

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.880
Very rich man but very humble.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.560
Then he invited Me for-

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.000
then he came to our program, got his Realization,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:54.640
very humble.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.123
He put his both the hands like this,

00:09:56.123 --> 00:09:56.200
[Shri Mataji raises her hands, with&nbsp;
2 fingers forming the ‘V’ of victory]

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.680
started dancing, an old man.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.560
Then he called Me to his house for dinner.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.240
He said, “Now you tell me where I have to go,

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.960
what I have to do, I’ll talk to anyone.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.080
They are calling me in Algeria”.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.753
I said, “If they are calling you&nbsp;
in Algeria, you’d better go”.

00:10:12.753 --> 00:10:16.797
And he was little worried because&nbsp;
Algeria is a very turbulent country.

00:10:16.797 --> 00:10:20.800
He went there, solved the problem, came back.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:26.360
Now he wants to go alone because his own brother,

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:31.000
his own younger brother,&nbsp;
has been elected now in Iran

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.400
instead of this fellow.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:38.760
And he said that, “Still not&nbsp;
he’s taken over but he’s there”.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:44.140
So, through him, we can work it out very well.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:48.240
It’s a very powerful man, very sensible.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.300
And he says, “Mother, this is the&nbsp;
only way you can unite Muslims,

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.560
either, they will be all finished.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:59.320
Everywhere they are killed and&nbsp;
this happening, that happening”.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:05.040
Somebody has to tell them that&nbsp;
the time of resurrection has come.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:13.389
And they said that, “There is a&nbsp;
written thing about the Qiyamah”.

00:11:13.389 --> 00:11:14.800
It’s the resurrection time.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:21.440
They call it the 12th Al-mahdi, Al-mahdi.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:30.240
So, you see, actually, in the previous&nbsp;
Persian language are [unclear] the primordial.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:36.920
And ‘am, amah’ means Mother.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.000
So, the primordial Mother will come.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.200
It’s according to the&nbsp;
Zoroastrian, who was there before.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.240
But I don’t know how far the&nbsp;
Muslims will listen to it.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:12:07.567
Because they are – either will&nbsp;
be destroyed or will be finished,

00:12:07.566 --> 00:12:19.639
the way they are doing thing.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:26.480
So, I’m sure it will work&nbsp;
out in some proper manner,

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:30.160
so that they are saved after&nbsp;
all, they are also human beings.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:54.480
So, we have to pray also that&nbsp;
they get wisdom to understand.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:13:00.320
Also lots of Chinese, we&nbsp;
have you got them in Taiwan.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.880
Lots.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:10.440
Hong Kong, where there is quite a lot.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:14.080
But Taipei were such good Chinese.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:19.400
All were Chinese also, in Taipei, all.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:25.513
And there, we had lots of Japanese this time.

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:30.880
It’s very surprising how Japanese&nbsp;
are taking to Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.520
Very serious.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.360
And the questions they asked were so nice.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:40.880
“How do we meditate? When do we meditate?”

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.360
All such questions, very positive.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.640
So, Japanese are taking now to Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:50.597
They were at least five hundred persons there.

00:13:50.597 --> 00:13:52.680
It was very satisfying.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:59.040
So, now we have to have various people also here,

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.000
and also Chinese that are here.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.120
I’m sure this will work out very well

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:11.600
if we just understand that we&nbsp;
have to be all right first.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:16.880
And then, we have to make others all right.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.840
Tomorrow after the program, I’ll tell them

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.240
that I can meet you here.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.920
So, you can come tomorrow after the program.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.800
And if you have any personal problems,

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.040
you can write it down and keep it here,

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:37.320
so that I’ll deal with it tomorrow.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.880
What is it, that?

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:42.013
Now.

00:14:42.013 --> 00:14:44.480
I’ve been talking, talking so much now.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:52.510
Little bit that throat also.

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:52.560
[Shri Mataji takes something against her coughing]

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:56.680
So, if you have any questions or any problems,

00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.680
please write it down and send it over.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.000
Tomorrow, I’ll answer.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.640
Tomorrow after the program.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:11.422
All right?

00:15:11.422 --> 00:15:11.440
May God bless you.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:16.200
I’m sure tomorrow it will work out.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:23.476
And we’ll get more people, I’m sure.

00:15:23.476 --> 00:15:28.960
The advertisements are also in Chinese or not?

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.608
Sahaja Yogi: Only in English.

00:15:34.608 --> 00:15:36.960
Shri Mataji: For everyone, only English?

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:41.045
But Chinese understand?

00:15:41.045 --> 00:15:41.062
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

00:15:41.062 --> 00:15:42.347
Shri Mataji: They understand English.

00:15:42.347 --> 00:15:59.841
Sahaja Yogi: Most of them.

00:15:59.841 --> 00:16:02.488
Shri Mataji: All right.

00:16:02.487 --> 00:16:04.558
May God bless you.
