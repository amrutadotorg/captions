WEBVTT

00:21.680 --> 00:27.700
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:34.060 --> 00:42.220
At the very outset, I have to say we should
know what is the truth.

00:42.900 --> 00:46.040
Everybody is seeking the truth,

00:46.040 --> 00:52.100
but they have no idea as to what they should find.

00:53.040 --> 00:57.300
There is an urge within us

00:57.660 --> 01:01.200
because these times are special,

01:01.500 --> 01:04.280
and we are seeking.

01:04.280 --> 01:08.280
But still, we don't have a clear cut idea

01:08.280 --> 01:18.261
as to what we should seek and what we should achieve after our seeking.

01:19.280 --> 01:33.180
Now I would like to refer to all the
great books on religion, about truth.

01:33.860 --> 01:40.660
They all have said that, "You have to know yourself".

01:40.820 --> 01:48.820
- knowing yourself is the point - and that you
have to become the Spirit.

01:50.020 --> 02:02.267
It's said in all these religions but though we can find, that these religions are not really doing that.

02:02.267 --> 02:10.000
They are not yet able to give you the truth.

02:10.440 --> 02:14.580
And that is why there is so much of conflict,

02:14.580 --> 02:16.940
so much of fights going on.

02:17.160 --> 02:19.820
There are all real religions, no doubt.

02:19.820 --> 02:23.380
And the essence of every religion is the same.

02:23.380 --> 02:28.539
Despite all that, they're fighting in the name
of religion.

02:28.539 --> 02:31.613
How can that be?

02:32.080 --> 02:45.000
It can be explained very well, that if you
have lost our way, we can go into opposite directions.

02:45.880 --> 03:02.178
So, when we know we have to know ourselves, and that is our goal of life, that is how we are going to improve on our life as such.

03:02.178 --> 03:07.440
That has been not so clearly explained.

03:07.700 --> 03:18.840
But, where there is an arrangement within us
or not, is been told by most of them,

03:18.840 --> 03:33.142
and that arrangement must have been told to you, lies in the triangular bone, 3 and a half coils of energy which is divine,

03:33.142 --> 03:42.120
which can connect us to the All-pervading Power of truth, which is a very subtle energy.

03:43.420 --> 03:49.180
And when that happens, you get connected with that Power.

03:49.740 --> 03:53.580
And that Power starts flowing through you.

03:53.580 --> 03:59.260
And you can feel it on your fingertips that Power flowing.

04:00.000 --> 04:06.700
This is a fact. We have to first verify before denying it.

04:06.700 --> 04:17.800
If it could happen to you all, that you can feel this All-pervading Power on your fingertips,

04:17.800 --> 04:21.724
then it's an experience.

04:21.724 --> 04:31.320
It's, not just by giving you a big lecture or telling you about something fantastic, but it is actualization.

04:31.500 --> 04:42.040
Most important thing is the actualization, is the becoming of you being the Spirit.

04:42.040 --> 04:49.340
This has to happen, all kinds of acrobats people may tell you.

04:50.580 --> 04:59.380
It's, absolutely, I must say, is a false pretext.

05:01.240 --> 05:07.580
No amount of acrobats are necessary.

05:08.580 --> 05:15.200
It is 'Sahaja'. Sahaj means spontaneous, it is within you.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.520
All of you have this power.

05:17.520 --> 05:28.560
All of you are capable of becoming the Spirit, but you must understand what you should expect, what you should become.

05:28.560 --> 05:37.980
Unless and until you have proper value system
about it, nothing can be explained.

05:38.540 --> 05:44.900
And you can be mislead by all other nonsensical things.

05:44.900 --> 05:51.540
Of course, you can't pay for it because it's a living process of your evolution.

05:52.240 --> 05:57.860
Now you are  at a human awareness, but it's, not sufficient.

05:57.860 --> 06:04.800
You have to rise higher, higher into the realm of the spirituality.

06:04.800 --> 06:12.060
It's not spiritualism, but spirituality, where you become the Spirit, the master.

06:12.060 --> 06:16.460
It's, not difficult at all, I assure you, it's not difficult..

06:17.760 --> 06:27.480
America has bean somehow, the last place, because I came long time back to begin with.

06:27.480 --> 06:37.400
But I found people were running after all kinds of business nonsensical people.

06:37.665 --> 06:38.940
Then I gave up.

06:38.940 --> 06:50.240
I said, "I'll go to America after 9 years". And then I came, and gradually I started understanding that they are seekers.

06:50.260 --> 06:52.860
They're really seekers.

06:52.860 --> 06:57.895
Not that they are in any way hypocritical.

06:57.895 --> 07:09.442
But it is the way people are enticing them and taking them under their own control, that they cannot see the point.

07:09.442 --> 07:14.635
And the point is, you can't do anything about it.

07:15.120 --> 07:21.540
A person may come and tell you, "You must get detached, give me all your property, all your money,

07:21.540 --> 07:27.892
and I'll give you two pair off clothes to wear".

07:27.892 --> 07:32.920
And so many have done that. By doing this kind of nonsense,

07:32.920 --> 07:38.560
are you going to enter inside yourself ?

07:38.560 --> 07:41.480
Is it possible?

07:41.480 --> 07:48.680
Just think of it. So many people have come here telling you all kinds of stories.

07:48.680 --> 07:55.060
In your humble seeking, you have been mislaid,
and I feel very sorry for it.

07:55.560 --> 08:04.460
Now try to understand that you have been very special people as human beings.

08:05.460 --> 08:14.280
And that you have to become a super-human being, we can call, the greatly evolved soul.

08:14.280 --> 08:21.253
We have so many. We had so many. And those we had, we call them by different names.

08:21.253 --> 08:27.314
They were called the Sufis and Great Masters.

08:27.314 --> 08:32.673
But they are not intelligible, normally to people,

08:32.920 --> 08:38.660
because unless and until you have the awareness, which is enlightened by your Spirit,

08:38.660 --> 08:42.680
you cannot understand what they're talking about.

08:44.180 --> 08:53.992
Now the time has come for all of you to get your Realization.
You have been seeking for ages now.

08:54.300 --> 09:00.760
It is already described in books that the day will come, the time will come.

09:01.440 --> 09:07.175
They call it as Kali Yuga is the worst time that is now.

09:07.175 --> 09:18.963
At this time, people who are seeking God, in the hills and dales, will get into proper family life.

09:18.963 --> 09:25.380
And they will get their Self-realization through this Kundalini awakening.

09:25.900 --> 09:33.189
Now, in the name of Kundalini also, lots of nonsense has been said, which is surprising.

09:33.189 --> 09:50.353
How people accepted that a Kundalini can be dangerous and a person who gets Kundalini's awakening will be very much harmed?

09:50.353 --> 09:57.326
Now she is your Mother. Kundalini is your exclusive Mother.

09:57.326 --> 10:07.124
She knows each and everything about you. She knows about your faults and also your aspirations.

10:07.124 --> 10:14.720
Everything is recorded in her. And she's extremely careful when she gives you the second birth.

10:14.720 --> 10:20.240
And she takes up all the problems upon herself.
She doesn't bother you.

10:20.280 --> 10:28.680
She doesn't trouble you. And she is the one who looks after your second birth.

10:28.680 --> 10:38.680
Again, I say, it's the actualization, actualization of baptism, you can call it, but it's not the way they do.

10:38.680 --> 10:48.880
It's actualization; it happens that this rises, passes through 6 centers and pierces through your fontanel bone area.

10:48.880 --> 10:59.680
and you do feel on your hands, fingers, and out off your head, the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

11:00.240 --> 11:02.220
This has to happen.

11:02.220 --> 11:11.280
Otherwise, whatever stories one may tell, you should not believe. It has to show results.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.640
Now the centers that we have.

11:17.060 --> 11:29.442
All these 7 centers are responsible for our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being.

11:29.442 --> 11:38.840
So many people get cured. Many people have problems, mentally, they get cured.

11:39.180 --> 11:45.140
And spiritually, you get endowed with the absolute knowledge, absolute knowledge.

11:45.140 --> 11:52.700
Not knowledge that we learned in the schools or colleges, but the knowledge which is absolute.

11:53.100 --> 12:06.880
For example, if you want to know about someone, you can ask a question and you'll be amazed.

12:06.880 --> 12:12.940
If the question is 'yes', then you start getting
the cool breeze flowing fast.

12:12.949 --> 12:24.699
But if it is 'no' or it is wrong, then you might get a little tingle or might get very hot

12:24.700 --> 12:33.483
from those persons who are to be tested.

12:33.483 --> 12:39.758
It's, a very, very interesting, precise, and a scientific method.

12:40.200 --> 12:48.240
Now, if there are doctors, I would like to tell that you get in control with the parasympathetic nervous system.

12:48.240 --> 12:55.924
Luckily, there's going to be a big conference
with me with the doctors in New York.

12:55.924 --> 12:59.540
I don't know what the association it is called. I don't know.

13:00.479 --> 13:05.700
All right. Now in that, they are convinced now.

13:05.700 --> 13:15.020
That what I'm saying is a fact and that
helps you. You get cured by yourself.

13:15.020 --> 13:17.880
And you can also cure others.

13:17.880 --> 13:25.340
There is no need to have this horrible modern diseases
that you are afraid of.

13:25.340 --> 13:30.160
You can just find out about it in no time.

13:30.160 --> 13:43.960
Apart from that, you just know how to treat others, how to cure others, how to help others.

13:44.080 --> 13:57.560
But apart from that, what you get is the spiritual blessing. And the spiritual blessing is this that you get the peace in your heart.

13:58.100 --> 14:05.440
Surprisingly, when this Kundalini rises, she,  some way or other,

14:05.440 --> 14:09.540
by joining with the Divine Power, All-pervading Power,

14:09.540 --> 14:24.000
assumes her personality, which is extremely pure, extremely benevolent, extremely tolerant and extremely truthful.

14:24.740 --> 14:39.180
All your enemies that we call like anger, lust, greed, all these enemies just drop.

14:39.180 --> 14:45.309
And you are no more in the entanglement of those enemies.

14:45.309 --> 14:50.983
And you become a free person, absolutely a free person.

14:50.983 --> 15:06.134
Above all, you are so beautiful, you become such a nice person
that you establish your peace.

15:06.910 --> 15:12.960
Now normal human beings, what do they do?

15:12.960 --> 15:17.920
They react. They reacted at anything.

15:17.920 --> 15:27.757
See, they were telling me that, "Still there is time, people are still coming, doesn't matter. You can come late.
There is no 'don't come just now'. All right."

15:27.757 --> 15:32.665
But I don't know how to react.

15:32.665 --> 15:40.197
And that's why when I came they said, "Mother, still you look very relaxed". I said, "I never reacted to this". So, you don't react.

15:40.740 --> 15:49.900
By not reaction what happens, that the thoughts that come to you come from the future and the past

15:50.040 --> 15:57.211
and you are lost in those thoughts because you are jumping on the crest of this thoughts.

15:57.211 --> 16:02.780
When the Kundalini rises, the thoughts are like this [like waves].

16:03.020 --> 16:11.480
She elongates those thoughts and a space is created, which we call it as 'pause' or  'vilamba'.

16:11.600 --> 16:17.700
In that state, you become absolutely peaceful.

16:18.220 --> 16:24.131
You don't think anymore.
We call it 'thoughtless awareness' that Jung has described.

16:24.131 --> 16:30.820
That means you watch anything just as a witness. You see everything as a witness.

16:31.040 --> 16:36.055
See, there is a very nice carpet here.
I am seeing it.

16:36.520 --> 16:45.660
Now, supposing it belonged to me, If I was normal, I would have said, "Oh My God, I don't know how are they going to keep it".

16:45.660 --> 16:57.260
In case this belongs to somebody else I would appreciate it, and I'd say, "Oh, I must buy this, how much it will cost, I hope it's insured" and all kinds of things.

16:57.820 --> 17:06.360
But if I am a Realized person, then I just watch it without thinking.

17:06.600 --> 17:18.520
And the joy that the artist has put into this carpet
enables you to enjoy, enjoy it without reaction.

17:18.520 --> 17:28.965
And this state, we call it as 'sahajawastha'
where a person becomes absolutely one with himself. Complete.

17:28.965 --> 17:38.820
And when he looks at anything, he doesn't react, he sees, he becomes the witness. You become just the witness of the whole thing.

17:39.140 --> 17:46.920
Your memory improves, your ideas about creation, anything.

17:46.920 --> 17:58.740
I mean, you become an extremely, extremely - I should say - creative person, and you don't develop the pride.

17:58.900 --> 18:05.020
You don't develop falsehood, but you just enjoy creating something.

18:05.020 --> 18:13.180
Human being is the most useful thing and the most beautiful thing that Divine has created.

18:13.180 --> 18:15.660
But we don't know what we are.

18:15.660 --> 18:21.000
That’s why always it is said, "Know thyself". "Know yourself".

18:21.000 --> 18:28.780
Unless and until you know yourself, how can you say, "I hate myself"or "I do this, I do that".

18:28.780 --> 18:32.980
Actually, the beauty lies within you

18:32.980 --> 18:41.784
and is to be expressed through these divine vibrations.

18:44.660 --> 18:49.721
Now the health improves no doubt, so many have improved their health.

18:49.721 --> 18:53.576
But I've seen in London, in the beginning,

18:53.576 --> 18:57.280
so many boys were taking drugs
gave it up overnight.

18:57.280 --> 18:59.060
I never say, "Don't give up".

18:59.060 --> 19:02.547
I don't say,  "Don't". If you say "don't",

19:02.547 --> 19:08.140
then they will- half of them will run away. Let them play, let them get their Realization.

19:08.140 --> 19:18.760
Then automatically, the whole thing drops out, and you shoot out,  out of that, and you become the real personality.

19:19.420 --> 19:27.640
Thus you know the reality, because you're not any more contaminated by your ego or your superego.

19:28.020 --> 19:33.570
These thoughts come to you from your ego or superego, meaning your conditioning.

19:33.570 --> 19:42.251
You are no bothered. You are absolutely free and you see everything in its real position.

19:43.020 --> 19:51.460
This kind of thing happening was already destined, has been already prophesied,

19:51.640 --> 19:54.420
that it's going to happen in those days.

19:54.420 --> 19:57.548
And so if -

19:57.548 --> 20:02.237
You can come here, this side we have chairs.

20:05.800 --> 20:07.460
All right.

20:08.640 --> 20:18.820
So, this is how we are going to become ourselves and we will know what we are and what we are capable of.

20:18.820 --> 20:28.740
Our capabilities are fathomless. But unless
and until we are connected, how can we act?

20:28.740 --> 20:34.700
For example, this instrument, if it is not connected to the mains, it is useless.

20:34.700 --> 20:40.040
In the same way, you are to be connected to the mains, it's very important.

20:40.040 --> 20:43.760
For that, you don't have to do anything.

20:43.760 --> 20:46.920
It just works spontaneously within you.

20:46.920 --> 20:51.780
And you get your Self-realization without any doubt.

20:51.780 --> 21:00.000
Actually, I must have given thousands of lectures, all over the world, and there's no end of it.

21:00.000 --> 21:10.320
I would like you people to ask me some questions, which I would like to answer. If you have any.

21:18.180 --> 21:24.700
Is there any questions? You could raise a hand?

21:30.846 --> 21:35.020
What is the purpose of having the photograph?

21:35.020 --> 21:40.980
The thing is, if you can do without the photograph, nothing like it.

21:40.980 --> 21:52.460
But you need something to support and that's why people use the photograph. If you don't need it, it's all right.

21:52.460 --> 21:55.460
But you'll find you'll need it.

21:59.800 --> 22:01.580
All right.

22:05.800 --> 22:08.920
How do you awaken the Kundalini?

22:09.080 --> 22:13.240
That's, my job I will do it. All right?

22:13.240 --> 22:18.260
It's very simple. How does a Mother Earth sprout the seed?

22:18.320 --> 22:24.360
How does she do it? It's innately built-in in her, that power, isn't it?

22:24.600 --> 22:27.747
What else?

22:35.600 --> 22:40.820
What is the relationships between Paramatma and Kundalini?

22:40.820 --> 22:47.140
All right.Very good question. Paramatma is the God Almighty, all right?

22:47.420 --> 22:56.920
And his Power is the Adi Shakti. It's the Power that has done all the creation, everything.

22:56.920 --> 23:06.140
While Paramatma is the one who is just a spectator of the whole thing, "drishta" [observer] as they call it.

23:06.520 --> 23:13.422
While Adi Shakti is the one who does all the creation and everything.

23:13.422 --> 23:26.618
Now Paramatma is in your heart reflected as Spirit and Kundalini is reflected in your triangular bone as Adi Shakti.

23:26.618 --> 23:33.640
Adi Shakti's reflection is the Kundalini.

23:33.640 --> 23:39.300
Oh, you'll get absolute knowledge, everything.

24:01.760 --> 24:05.900
What should come first?

24:05.900 --> 24:08.300
What should come first? What?

24:08.300 --> 24:12.040
The Kundalini awakening or dissolving the jealousy in other character?

24:12.040 --> 24:20.140
No, no,  Kundalini awakening is the one by which all these things happened.

24:21.980 --> 24:24.000
Automatically.

24:24.820 --> 24:33.517
Is it not first necessary to work on the negative tendencies and then get the Kundalini awakening?

24:33.517 --> 24:40.360
There is no need. In Sahaja Yoga, there's no need to work it out.

24:40.560 --> 24:48.097
The negative forces themselves run away, 99%. In 1% maybe it still sticks.

24:48.097 --> 25:01.050
But otherwise, a ninety nine percent, they all run away with the light of the Kundalini with the enlightenment of the Spirit on your attention.

25:06.460 --> 25:11.500
So, I can continue with my mischief  as long as I have awakened my Kundalini?

25:11.640 --> 25:13.960
Yes, of course. [Laughter]

25:14.660 --> 25:16.360
No doubt.

25:16.620 --> 25:24.020
Only on the contrary, you become a multidimensional personality.

25:26.670 --> 25:31.311
[The Sahaja Yogi explains the question in Hindi]

25:31.400 --> 25:34.620
You try, you can't do it.

25:34.620 --> 25:39.518
If you're doing something wrong, you can't do it after Kundalini awakening,

25:39.518 --> 25:48.820
because you see what is destructive for you and what is constructive for you. So you don't do it. You just don't do it.

25:48.820 --> 25:54.320
I told you just now that overnight people gave up drugs.

25:54.320 --> 25:57.640
I didn't tell them.

25:57.640 --> 26:02.660
It's the light. If you are sitting in the darkness, you don't know where are you.

26:02.660 --> 26:09.720
But if there is light, you know, everything is
like that. It's enlightenment I'm talking about.

26:10.540 --> 26:17.580
What is the first step to not desire?

26:18.040 --> 26:23.660
Just to desire that you should get your Self-realization.

26:23.660 --> 26:27.440
You must have a strong desire.

26:29.380 --> 26:31.260
Yes, madam?

26:33.360 --> 26:34.700
Hm?

26:38.716 --> 26:45.700
By practicing this, can I control my heart rate?

26:45.880 --> 26:54.440
Everything, everything. It's his control, you don't have to do.

27:09.060 --> 27:16.880
Because of practicing Christian religion, she feels that she is going to hell

27:17.040 --> 27:18.440
Correct.

27:18.440 --> 27:21.860
And does that mean that by practicing this, it will be the same?

27:21.860 --> 27:34.800
I was also born in a Christian religion and I know that how Christianity was just opposite of Christ, but - just a minute.

27:34.800 --> 27:45.660
But after Realization, you are enlightened, and you see the beauty of every religion, and the essence of every religion.

27:45.800 --> 28:00.000
And then you also understand that you are
capable yourself of following a spiritual part without any difficulties.

28:00.000 --> 28:09.339
Nothing destructive, nothing wrong nothing manipulated. It's your own. You become your own master.

28:20.780 --> 28:27.020
Have you ever met Paramhamsa Yogodanda and are you familiar withhis teaching?

28:30.620 --> 28:38.980
Those who I met and those - I've nothing to say.

28:59.080 --> 29:03.647
Can you leave your body at will?

29:03.647 --> 29:08.182
Can you leave your body and travel?

29:08.182 --> 29:14.124
I don't want to do that.

29:14.880 --> 29:20.800
What's the use? It is done through some spirits I think.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.320
Yes, madam.

29:36.777 --> 29:45.384
She has a desire, she has love, but so many forces pull you away from that.

29:45.384 --> 29:52.380
Yes, it's correct. But just now, just now, I promise you that you will get your Realization.

29:52.380 --> 29:58.240
And then you'll see, all these forces will drop out, all right?

30:02.500 --> 30:10.642
[Hindi. Shri Mataji reads a letter.]

30:32.380 --> 30:38.960
Yes, this means left side is caught up, whoever has written this letter?

30:38.960 --> 30:44.340
That means left side is not all right.

30:44.340 --> 30:47.680
But it can be put right.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.142
Yes?

31:04.140 --> 31:12.940
You said that it is a special time. And could you talk a little bit more about that?

31:12.940 --> 31:21.760
It is called as Kali Yuga. And also this is the time of Last Judgment.

31:21.760 --> 31:36.460
And at this time, one has to be very careful because you are going to be judged whether you take to truth or not.

31:36.920 --> 31:45.020
If you are still with falsehood, you are judged. You will judge yourself, nobody needs to judge you.

31:45.460 --> 31:50.600
But so many things will happen that we realized there's something wrong.

31:58.120 --> 32:05.720
What was the advice that Mahatma Gandhi gave to you as a young woman?

32:05.720 --> 32:12.600
He didn't give me any advice. I had to give him advice.

32:18.620 --> 32:27.430
But he did say that, "Let our country be free. Then you can start your Sahaja Yoga program. Not before that".

32:27.840 --> 32:35.180
That was his idea that we are not yet free to propagate anything.

32:43.600 --> 32:52.720
After you give us our Kundalini awakening tonight, how often should we do it?

32:52.980 --> 32:55.000
Very good question.

32:55.000 --> 33:02.440
You don't have to as there is no number of times, you have to do it.
Only once it is enlightened, it is enlightened.

33:02.440 --> 33:06.240
But we have problems still there.

33:06.240 --> 33:15.091
So, the Kundalini goes back to correct it sometimes. So, we have here a proper "follow up" they call it.

33:15.091 --> 33:22.320
And after that, we have centres where you can go. Also, nobody will charge any money.

33:22.320 --> 33:29.980
And they'll find out what's wrong with you and they'll try to tell you what is to be done.

33:29.980 --> 33:41.939
It happens with very few, but you'll enjoy going to the center because it's all enjoyment there, free of charge.

33:45.600 --> 33:50.820
Does that mean that we should not do this very often at home ourselves?

33:50.820 --> 33:56.140
They will tell you. You have to meditate - that they will tell you how to meditate-

33:56.140 --> 34:02.800
and if you follow it for ten-fifteen minutes at the most, and it works out and you can grow,

34:02.800 --> 34:09.500
because after all, this first germination of the seed, you see, is there,

34:09.500 --> 34:13.660
but it has to grow. And some people grow so fast!

34:13.660 --> 34:20.960
I'm surprised sometimes, that at the very first meeting only, they become great people.

34:23.160 --> 34:28.640
Does the Kundalini ever become dormant again?

34:28.940 --> 34:32.300
Dormant? No, it does not.

34:32.300 --> 34:43.260
But if you try not to pay attention to its proper alignment or proper development,

34:43.260 --> 34:49.780
then it becomes static at that point. But it never goes back.

34:58.760 --> 35:06.140
For many years I've been trying to meet you and I'm very blessed to see you here.

35:06.140 --> 35:09.280
I see.

35:21.080 --> 35:32.060
Once we have got it, what can we do to bring more peace to our community?

35:32.060 --> 35:39.360
You can, you can do it. If your desire is so, you can really help them, you can really help.

35:39.360 --> 35:47.540
I mean, that's what is happening now as you see these people say that Sahaja Yoga is working in 86 countries.

35:47.540 --> 35:55.140
What happened, that one person got his Realization he went to his country and he changed so many people.

35:55.140 --> 36:03.300
In a far-fetched country like Benin, imagine Benin where they have mostly muslims,

36:03.720 --> 36:10.480
there are seven thousand Sahaja Yogis. In Turkey, we have three thousand.

36:10.480 --> 36:20.940
And in a so many places we have, but the maximum in Benin where there are mostly people who are, who were Muslims.

36:20.960 --> 36:28.120
And I was surprised and asked them, "Why did you become Muslims?" So they said, "Because the French were here and

36:28.120 --> 36:34.060
we didn't like the way they were immoral so we thought their religion is no good. So became Muslims".

36:34.060 --> 36:39.260
But now they are great Sahaja Yogis, very, very great Sahaja Yogis.

36:39.260 --> 36:43.331
So many Muslim countries have become Sahaja Yogis.

36:43.331 --> 36:48.870
All over the world we have. In Russia we have thousands and thousands and thousands.

36:48.870 --> 36:57.159
And Russians are very deep people. I tell you, this so-called freedom we had we have gone helter-skelter.

36:57.159 --> 37:06.781
While the Russians had no freedom, they could not even talk about God they did not read anything about Divine,

37:06.781 --> 37:16.369
and they developed, I think, out of that tyranny of  communism, developed within themselves a very, very deep understanding.

37:16.369 --> 37:28.220
And they are there. You'll be amazed that Sahaja Yoga is now practiced in so many countries where I never even thought I would reach,

37:28.220 --> 37:33.940
but Sahaja Yogis have gone and done the job.

37:35.320 --> 37:37.140
[Hindi]

37:41.740 --> 37:48.860
What is your first recollection about your childhood of being awaken? How old were you?

37:48.860 --> 37:58.476
Now, can I ask you one question? What was your first understanding that you are a human being?

37:59.340 --> 38:01.780
It's like that only.

38:01.780 --> 38:08.360
As you were aware of you being a human being, I was aware.

38:24.740 --> 38:34.020
You said you were born in a Christian family, so what is your faith what is your religion, what is your God?

38:34.020 --> 38:38.040
I have no religion.

38:38.320 --> 38:42.180
No, I have all the religions.

38:42.700 --> 38:51.060
Born in any family should not, sort of, stop your vision.

38:51.060 --> 38:57.040
You can see through everything, if you have the light.

39:05.660 --> 39:10.040
There's another one. Now I was, I must say,

39:10.040 --> 39:17.401
here there are so many people who are asking questions, normally, I don't find that experience, doesn't matter.

39:17.401 --> 39:23.040
But how many will become good Sahaja Yogis is to be seen out of you.

39:23.040 --> 39:27.800
It's all right to ask questions after questions, but that is of no value,

39:27.800 --> 39:40.000
unless and until you really become what I'm saying, a Sahaja Yogi, a real personality that is absolutely spiritual.

39:40.000 --> 39:46.045
So, we have to see that, that is the challenge for all of you, let's see how many.

39:46.045 --> 39:53.960
I must say, Los Angeles has bean really a "lost angeles", so far for me.

39:53.960 --> 39:59.340
But Sahaja Yogis always felt that I can do very well here, so I came.

39:59.340 --> 40:09.205
Now this is the fifth question you're asking, madam. Will you please take your Realization and then ask me, all right?

40:11.841 --> 40:14.741
This is another one.

40:15.200 --> 40:20.780
You see, once you have asked a question, you shouldn't ask another question, please.

40:22.241 --> 40:29.698
Because all of them are waiting for their Self-realization, they're all waiting for their Self-realization.

40:30.100 --> 40:35.120
Only few who want to ask questions; is one is all right.

40:35.120 --> 40:38.780
But not all the time go on asking questions. What is there?

40:38.780 --> 40:42.380
Unless and until you are a journalist?

40:43.420 --> 40:45.580
[Hindi].

40:45.580 --> 40:47.340
She is asking, "Can we start"?

40:47.340 --> 40:49.940
Yes, we should.

40:53.280 --> 40:57.780
Can you now write your questions and let me know?

40:58.860 --> 41:02.520
I'll answer them after you get your Realisation.

41:02.960 --> 41:07.640
Then you won't have any questions, I know.

41:14.300 --> 41:17.580
Again, I said, it is the becoming.

41:17.580 --> 41:22.580
You have to become. It's not just talking.

41:31.940 --> 41:34.620
Now, forget your questions for the time being.

41:34.620 --> 41:37.580
Better get your Realisation, all right?

41:39.760 --> 41:50.420
Now, one thing is that you have to just take
out your shoes or chapals, whatever it is,

41:50.420 --> 41:53.680
because this Mother Earth is of a great help.

41:53.680 --> 41:57.680
She sucks in all of our problems.

41:59.080 --> 42:02.800
Put both the feet apart from each other.

42:07.260 --> 42:10.160
You will know everything about Sahaja Yoga,

42:10.160 --> 42:13.760
why I said, to put your feet apart from each other,

42:13.760 --> 42:20.560
everything you will know very clearly, but they should touch the Mother Earth.

42:24.340 --> 42:28.820
You have to just be comfortable.

42:29.940 --> 42:35.460
And all of you should be seated.

42:37.180 --> 42:44.440
Before I start, I have to request that those who want their Realization only I can give them.

42:44.980 --> 42:52.820
It cannot be forced because Kundalini is the pure desire, is the pure desire.

42:54.480 --> 42:58.518
Not impure desire as we have, whatever desire we have.

42:58.518 --> 43:03.900
We have today one, then we want to have something else. Tat's, the principle of economics.

43:03.920 --> 43:11.160
But this is pure desire and for this pure desire you should be determined to get it.

43:11.700 --> 43:18.440
It's your own character, your own understanding only will work it out.

43:19.700 --> 43:34.000
Now, I would request you all to sit comfortably with both feet like this, very comfortably. And put both your hands, towards me, like this.

43:56.660 --> 44:02.820
Now what I find, that some of you feel guilty.

44:04.540 --> 44:06.960
It's a nonsense.

44:07.180 --> 44:15.020
If you feel guilty, then this center here catches on the left-hand side and the Kundalini doesn't move.

44:15.560 --> 44:19.460
So, if you have done anything wrong, I agree.

44:19.460 --> 44:24.080
So, it's finished. That's the past.

44:24.080 --> 44:27.457
You don't have to worry about that.

44:27.457 --> 44:38.225
At this moment, please, you have to know that you are not guilty at all for anything!

44:38.225 --> 44:41.400
So, please forgive yourself.

44:41.400 --> 44:43.960
Please forgive yourself.

44:44.580 --> 44:50.740
Now the second thing is that we have to forgive also others.

44:50.740 --> 44:57.260
Now, some people say, "It's difficult to forgive, Mother". I mean, what do you do?

44:57.260 --> 45:03.620
Whether you forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do anything! What do you do?

45:03.620 --> 45:09.340
Nothing. But by not forgiving, you torture
yourself.

45:09.340 --> 45:12.080
So, best thing is to forgive all of them.

45:12.080 --> 45:20.300
Forgive everybody who was harmed you, who has troubled you, who has made you unhappy, has hurt.

45:20.300 --> 45:25.320
Forgive! Don't also think about them. It's also useless.

45:26.240 --> 45:29.640
By forgiving, you don't know what will happen.

45:30.060 --> 45:33.200
Absolutely, you will feel peaceful with yourself.

45:33.200 --> 45:42.500
Just forgive everyone. This nobleness you should accept today, that you forgive everyone. Just forgive.

45:42.980 --> 45:48.980
Now, please put your hands towards me. Like this.

45:48.980 --> 45:51.740
Comfortably, comfortably.

45:57.280 --> 46:09.240
Now you can put your right hand towards me, and feel with the left hand on top of your fontanelle bone area,

46:09.240 --> 46:21.720
little higher, if there is any cool or a hot breeze, like vibrations, are coming out of your own head.

46:23.380 --> 46:28.800
On your, say, palm, you can feel it.

46:28.800 --> 46:35.573
You move your hand up and down and see for yourself if you are feeling.

46:35.573 --> 46:40.001
Please remove your caps if you have, please. It's better to  remove.

46:41.000 --> 46:44.080
Now, please see.

46:45.160 --> 46:47.680
You must have respect for yourself,

46:47.680 --> 46:53.460
should not denounce yourself and you should also forgive everyone. That's, very important.

46:53.660 --> 47:01.740
Now put the left hand towards me, and put the right hand on top of your fontanelle bone area,

47:01.740 --> 47:18.420
and bend your head, just bend your head.And see for yourself if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your own fontanelle bone area.

47:19.100 --> 47:23.740
This is the actualization of the baptism, you may call it.

47:29.200 --> 47:32.940
Once more, put your right hand towards me.

47:33.280 --> 47:37.100
And see with your left hand

47:38.160 --> 47:50.800
if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanelle bone area, please keep your head bending.

47:57.960 --> 47:59.320
Now.

48:02.640 --> 48:09.220
If it is hot, means you have not forgiven yourself, or you have not forgiven others.

48:09.220 --> 48:20.780
So again, please forgive. Please forgive yourself and forgive others. That's a very great asset and help.

48:29.724 --> 48:43.200
Now see for yourself if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming on your fingertips or on your palms.

49:00.260 --> 49:05.220
Please forgive, forgive, forgive yourself and forgive others.

49:05.220 --> 49:13.220
Very important, because this center here, when the crossing of the optic chiasma,

49:13.220 --> 49:21.240
it get obstructed if you have not forgiven, so please forgive. Because its a myth not to forgive.

49:21.240 --> 49:23.500
So, please forgive.

49:24.723 --> 49:27.085
Hmm.

49:32.860 --> 49:41.660
I would say all those who have felt the cool breeze in their hands or hot breeze

49:41.940 --> 49:51.320
on their fingertips or on their palm or out of their fontanelle bone area,

49:52.260 --> 49:54.460
hot or cool breeze,

49:54.740 --> 49:57.460
please raise your hands.

50:04.500 --> 50:10.604
Mostly all of you have got it.
Mostly.

50:10.604 --> 50:15.653
May God bless you. May God bless you. May God bless you all.

50:15.653 --> 50:17.653
In such a short time, you have got it.

50:18.558 --> 50:25.580
That means really, we have got very wonderful people this time from Los Angeles.

50:25.640 --> 50:30.000
Those who are truly seeker, or real seekers.

50:30.000 --> 50:31.500
May God bless you for that.

50:31.500 --> 50:37.660
Now you must respect your Realization, and I hope you'll grow into it.

50:37.920 --> 50:47.680
You'll try to grow and become masters. Hardly it will take even one month maybe to become the masters.

50:47.680 --> 50:49.500
Why not do it?

50:49.500 --> 50:51.140
All right?

50:51.140 --> 50:54.650
May God bless you.
