00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.100
You must pray, to God and ask, what you want.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:17.540
Ask for: Complete satisfaction in my heart,
joy in my heart, bliss in my heart, so that

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.060
the whole world becomes blissful.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.360
Give me love, love that I could… love the
whole world and that the whole world becomes

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.580
one in love.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:50.060
Give salvation to this… humanity.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.980
Which is suffering.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.600
Take me to Your feet.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.000
Cleanse me with Thy love.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.620
Now see if there is God or not?

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.840
You can feel it within yourself.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.860
He hears you.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.820
He understands you.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:44.200
He’s the glory of all the glory.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.900
He loves you.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.160
He protects you.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.280
He guides you.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.580
He created you to reveal His love, but accept it.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:19.360
Any time any thought is coming you pray and
you will be moving in the waves of that ocean

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:27.100
which is unconscious mind, which starts with
thoughtless awareness.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:12.600
If you cannot become thoughtless,
you pray to Him: “Forgive me for what I

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:20.260
have done and forgive those who have done
harm to me.
