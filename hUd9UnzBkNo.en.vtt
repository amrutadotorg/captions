00:03.600 --> 00:09.100
You must pray, to God and ask, what you want.

00:09.110 --> 00:17.540
Ask for: Complete satisfaction in my heart,
joy in my heart, bliss in my heart, so that

00:17.540 --> 00:21.060
the whole world becomes blissful.

00:21.060 --> 00:28.360
Give me love, love that I could… love the
whole world and that the whole world becomes

00:28.360 --> 00:30.580
one in love.

00:39.720 --> 00:50.060
Give salvation to this… humanity.

00:52.500 --> 00:54.980
Which is suffering.

01:00.960 --> 01:03.600
Take me to Your feet.

01:03.600 --> 01:10.000
Cleanse me with Thy love.

01:19.800 --> 01:22.620
Now see if there is God or not?

01:22.620 --> 01:28.840
You can feel it within yourself.

01:28.840 --> 01:30.860
He hears you.

01:30.860 --> 01:35.820
He understands you.

01:35.820 --> 01:44.200
He’s the glory of all the glory.

01:44.320 --> 01:45.900
He loves you.

01:48.320 --> 01:50.160
He protects you.

01:50.300 --> 01:52.280
He guides you.

01:52.280 --> 01:57.580
He created you to reveal His love, but accept it.

02:07.980 --> 02:19.360
Any time any thought is coming you pray and
you will be moving in the waves of that ocean

02:19.360 --> 02:27.100
which is unconscious mind, which starts with
thoughtless awareness.

03:00.000 --> 03:12.600
If you cannot become thoughtless,
you pray to Him: “Forgive me for what I

03:12.600 --> 03:20.260
have done and forgive those who have done
harm to me.
