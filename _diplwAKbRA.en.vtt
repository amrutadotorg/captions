00:01.959 --> 00:03.959
Shivaratri Puja, Pune,
17 March 2002.

02:07.482 --> 02:16.649
Tonight we have gathered here to do Shri Shiva Puja.

02:26.690 --> 02:35.731
Those people who have a clean heart can only do Shiva Puja.

02:37.232 --> 02:44.898
Those whose heart is not clean cannot do Shiva Puja.

02:46.190 --> 02:51.856
It's a simple principle of Shri Shivaratri.

03:03.773 --> 03:08.856
As you have seen yesterday, we have snakes,

03:09.898 --> 03:14.482
or, these are horrible snakes

03:19.190 --> 03:23.981
guiding behind the Shiva Linga.

03:25.815 --> 03:33.315
The significance is this - those who are clean in heart,

03:37.731 --> 03:40.981
who are full of love for others,

03:43.981 --> 03:53.815
are always guarded by the power of Shiva,

03:54.065 --> 03:56.731
which are the snakes.

03:57.981 --> 04:04.731
It's a symbolic thing, to say, very symbolic.

04:05.731 --> 04:10.065
But I must say that animals understand

04:10.731 --> 04:16.898
Divine force much better than human beings, much better.

04:18.315 --> 04:21.315
Because they have a clean heart.

04:23.731 --> 04:31.565
Whatever is their lifestyle built by nature,

04:31.981 --> 04:33.565
they carry on with it.

04:33.981 --> 04:39.856
But there's no malice, there's no jealousy,

04:39.898 --> 04:44.898
there's not all these mean things in their heart.

04:45.357 --> 04:48.357
They do it because it is supposed to be.

04:50.731 --> 04:55.981
But the quality of human beings is only one

04:57.065 --> 05:02.357
- and that is how much they love and forgive.

05:04.731 --> 05:10.190
Loving capacity of human beings are such by

05:10.565 --> 05:14.731
which they conquer all their negative forces -

05:14.815 --> 05:19.190
they can, easily, see that it's not good

05:19.731 --> 05:22.357
to have all these qualities,

05:22.731 --> 05:26.981
or maybe that they understand it's not noble

05:27.065 --> 05:32.731
to indulge into all these inhuman behaviour.

05:35.815 --> 05:42.357
They are not bound to indulge into all these things.

05:44.190 --> 05:51.731
Neither they are asked to be,

05:53.815 --> 06:02.649
but suddenly they get lured by such things which has got hatred,

06:02.981 --> 06:10.981
jealously and greed.

06:14.357 --> 06:16.815
You see how Shiva lives.

06:18.232 --> 06:20.065
He lives in the Himalayas.

06:21.482 --> 06:26.482
See what clothes He wears, what He eats.

06:26.898 --> 06:33.065
He has no demand for anything because He's complete, He's perfect.

06:36.482 --> 06:40.690
Such a personality is Shiva's.

06:41.065 --> 06:44.898
And if you are worshipping Him,

06:44.981 --> 06:48.690
you should find out within your heart

06:49.232 --> 06:58.731
what sort of feelings you have, what sort of malice you nurture.

06:58.815 --> 07:05.232
These days in India, greed has become the main point.

07:06.649 --> 07:10.524
They are so mean and so low.

07:12.731 --> 07:20.856
Which impossible to understand that they think money is everything,

07:22.690 --> 07:26.731
which is not in the culture of Indians, no, no.

07:27.065 --> 07:28.731
In no way.

07:29.065 --> 07:32.649
But somehow they have picked it up,

07:32.940 --> 07:35.232
in the foreign countries perhaps,

07:35.649 --> 07:38.065
and it is spreading very much now,

07:38.357 --> 07:41.232
that money is the most important thing.

07:42.898 --> 07:44.649
Think of Shiva.

07:45.690 --> 07:47.898
He never thought of money.

07:50.981 --> 07:53.898
He never wanted any money.

07:55.690 --> 07:57.981
He never wanted to show off himself.

08:01.357 --> 08:06.524
There is such a difference between Shiva and Shakti.

08:07.898 --> 08:09.898
In their whole attitude.

08:09.981 --> 08:15.315
Because Shiva is absolutely a liberated personality,

08:15.524 --> 08:17.315
he's not bothered.

08:18.898 --> 08:20.357
If the people

08:20.565 --> 08:23.856
are indulging into wrong things, he'll destroy - finished!

08:26.232 --> 08:27.649
He doesn't want to cure,

08:27.856 --> 08:30.232
He doesn't want to improve, nothing of the kind.

08:30.649 --> 08:33.649
But for the Shakti it is important,

08:33.731 --> 08:38.649
because this is Her child, this universe is Her child.

08:38.731 --> 08:41.815
All this is created by Her,

08:41.856 --> 08:44.482
so naturally She is worried

08:44.856 --> 08:47.023
and She doesn't like people

08:47.315 --> 08:51.524
who try to take to mean things and nonsense.

08:54.898 --> 09:01.649
First of all it was human beings started indulging in power.

09:02.731 --> 09:07.815
They moved from countries to country to empower themselves.

09:07.856 --> 09:09.981
Where is that power gone? Finished.

09:12.399 --> 09:17.107
Then, after that, what happened with them

09:17.399 --> 09:22.399
is that they left their style with others.

09:24.815 --> 09:26.815
And now it seems

09:26.856 --> 09:31.524
it is very common to see people shamelessly being greedy.

09:35.690 --> 09:40.232
For them, is the solution, is Shiva.

09:41.690 --> 09:44.023
All such people will be destroyed. First of all

09:44.399 --> 09:50.399
they will be exposed and then they will be destroyed,

09:50.815 --> 09:53.232
to the last bit of it.

09:55.690 --> 09:58.023
Another thing is that

09:59.399 --> 10:05.148
Shiva respects a person who has a good character;

10:05.524 --> 10:08.524
a person with a good character.

10:09.898 --> 10:14.023
And if anyone is bad charactered

10:15.815 --> 10:23.148
or indulges into bad things, Shiva won't spare them.

10:24.524 --> 10:31.731
So the Shakti creates, protects, looks after them, brings them up.

10:32.148 --> 10:36.399
But Shiva is sitting there, just to destroy!

10:37.815 --> 10:43.399
Very important, this destruction is very important.

10:43.815 --> 10:46.815
The Shakti doesn't show those qualities.

10:46.856 --> 10:49.023
She may destroy some rakshasas,

10:49.399 --> 10:52.856
but He can destroy nations after nations.

10:54.315 --> 11:01.815
First of all the ego you have - who will destroy that?

11:01.898 --> 11:08.148
, Shiva. Shiva is in your Sahasrara.

11:08.565 --> 11:10.815
He is sitting in the Sahasrara;

11:10.898 --> 11:14.399
now remember, on top of everything.

11:16.565 --> 11:27.981
The other day I saw one gentleman from the Broadcasting, a newsman,

11:28.023 --> 11:34.981
who was very, very stupid and was talking, very harshly.

11:36.565 --> 11:42.315
And I saw his Ekadesha Rudra "My God" I said,

11:43.148 --> 11:47.148
"This one is now going to be in trouble. "

11:47.565 --> 11:52.815
What is Ekadesha is nothing but the eleven powers of Shiva.

11:52.898 --> 11:56.190
They build up here

11:56.565 --> 11:59.357
and give you all kinds of diseases;

11:59.524 --> 12:02.690
the worst of all is cancer.

12:02.731 --> 12:07.565
And I knew that this fellow is going to have a very bad time.

12:07.981 --> 12:11.856
He is not a Sahaja Yogi, how am I to tell him?

12:11.898 --> 12:13.898
How anybody has to tell him?

12:15.315 --> 12:18.731
But it comes from this Ekadesha Rudra.

12:19.190 --> 12:24.315
Now these are eleven powers of Shiva, very well described.

12:24.690 --> 12:28.856
Now these powers start working on people,

12:28.898 --> 12:30.898
even on Sahaja Yogis,

12:31.690 --> 12:36.565
if they do not follow the principle of Sahaja Yoga.

12:37.981 --> 12:41.856
He is, I should say, watching everything.

12:42.898 --> 12:45.981
Every part of your life He watches.

12:47.981 --> 12:53.023
How you behave, what you do, what is your dharma

12:53.482 --> 12:55.315
- He watches all that.

12:55.690 --> 12:59.690
And so many saints have warned you,

12:59.815 --> 13:03.023
so many incarnations have warned you;

13:03.482 --> 13:07.148
but I tell you if don't listen to them,

13:07.399 --> 13:10.898
then Shiva is not going to listen.

13:11.315 --> 13:13.565
He doesn't listen to anyone.

13:15.981 --> 13:17.565
If he's angry, he's angry.

13:17.981 --> 13:22.065
Whatever it is, very difficult to convince Him

13:22.482 --> 13:27.607
that 'Please spare this person, it's alright. Forgive.

13:28.190 --> 13:30.815
' But his basic quality is forgiveness,

13:31.190 --> 13:35.190
can you imagine? His basic quality is forgiveness.

13:35.565 --> 13:41.565
But if He doesn't forgive, then you are finished.

13:43.565 --> 13:48.065
Up to a point maybe He might forgive, but after that..

13:48.482 --> 13:52.856
It's a very, very difficult situation.

13:52.898 --> 13:57.856
And I find that people don't realise

13:57.898 --> 14:00.482
what Shiva is.

14:01.856 --> 14:05.399
In the south we have two types of people worshipers.

14:05.565 --> 14:08.190
One are shaivaites, another vaishnavaites.

14:09.565 --> 14:11.898
They are having a big fight between them.

14:12.357 --> 14:14.065
Now it is less, much less.

14:14.482 --> 14:20.357
What is the work of Vishnu is to give you realisation,

14:20.731 --> 14:24.482
emancipation of human beings, evolution of human beings.

14:25.856 --> 14:33.981
But if you fail in your goodness, in your dharma,

14:34.065 --> 14:39.649
then Shiva comes in your life.

14:41.981 --> 14:43.357
We have to understand

14:43.565 --> 14:47.357
that we are all surrounded by their powers,

14:47.731 --> 14:50.482
we are all made by their powers,

14:51.856 --> 14:55.856
is the Shakti who is protecting you.

14:55.981 --> 15:02.482
But to an extent. She cannot go above Shiva,

15:04.898 --> 15:07.065
She cannot cross Him.

15:09.649 --> 15:15.482
These days you find so many people indulging into politics

15:15.898 --> 15:18.065
- it's all money-making propositions.

15:19.482 --> 15:23.981
They all try to make money, it's not politics!

15:24.065 --> 15:29.065
They don't do any good to the whole communities, nowhere

15:29.482 --> 15:33.731
- either under fear or under abandonment.

15:33.815 --> 15:41.065
They behave in such a manner that they are not afraid of God,

15:41.482 --> 15:48.065
they are not afraid of His own attention on them.

15:49.482 --> 15:53.981
Perhaps they don't know that they are under the attention of Shiva.

15:55.856 --> 15:57.856
He's watching each and every person,

15:59.731 --> 16:04.524
whether you are Australian, English or Indian.

16:05.898 --> 16:11.981
Whatever religion you may follow, He's watching them.

16:12.649 --> 16:15.856
This is a thing one has to understand.

16:17.232 --> 16:19.232
And once you understand this,

16:20.649 --> 16:25.898
you will accept that you have to be good and dharmic people.

16:26.357 --> 16:28.856
You have to be good character people.

16:30.232 --> 16:33.524
Why people talk of good character?

16:33.898 --> 16:35.856
Try to understand!

16:36.232 --> 16:40.232
It's stupidity these days when people don't believe in it.

16:42.649 --> 16:44.649
People are doing all kinds of things,

16:44.690 --> 16:54.815
they are drinking, they are playing this...money business.

16:55.232 --> 16:57.357
All kinds of things they are doing

16:57.649 --> 17:06.649
without having any fear of the wrath of God.

17:07.815 --> 17:09.856
And that wrath comes from Shiva.

17:11.232 --> 17:12.856
I would like to warn you all,

17:13.232 --> 17:16.148
though you are all my children - be careful!

17:17.524 --> 17:19.981
Try to weigh every step that you take.

17:22.399 --> 17:24.731
Of course I am there to support you, to help you,

17:24.940 --> 17:25.856
to protect you.

17:26.232 --> 17:29.399
But, not beyond Shiva,

17:30.815 --> 17:32.399
I can't go beyond Him.

17:33.815 --> 17:42.649
It's such a power of Shiva, it's such an authority of Shiva.

17:43.731 --> 17:48.148
And to worship Him means to worship goodness in Him.

17:50.399 --> 17:55.815
The goodness could be compassion, could be love,

17:55.856 --> 17:58.649
could be forgiveness, anything.

17:58.731 --> 18:00.856
He likes only good people,

18:01.232 --> 18:03.856
and He will protect only good people.

18:04.232 --> 18:09.023
For example, some people are very power oriented,

18:09.399 --> 18:13.898
some are money oriented and some are power oriented.

18:14.023 --> 18:18.232
And the power oriented also do it for money sometimes,

18:18.690 --> 18:20.232
that's the aim.

18:20.690 --> 18:23.524
They'll not stay in Sahaj.

18:23.898 --> 18:26.524
They will be displaced.

18:26.898 --> 18:28.731
They do it, and then come and ask for forgiveness,

18:29.148 --> 18:32.023
"Oh Mother forgive us, we have done it".

18:32.399 --> 18:35.856
But try not to do anything of that kind.

18:36.023 --> 18:41.856
I, of course, forgive you, but Shiva, He won't, He won't.

18:44.315 --> 18:45.815
He will take you to task

18:45.856 --> 18:47.065
and then you will come to Me "Mother,

18:47.357 --> 18:49.731
You must save us!" It's very difficult.

18:50.148 --> 18:53.815
From His clutches it is very difficult.

18:53.856 --> 18:57.148
Also He's a very forgiving person.

18:57.524 --> 19:00.815
He forgives you, many things.

19:00.898 --> 19:04.023
Because of Me also He forgives.

19:04.399 --> 19:07.524
But, after some time when He takes over,

19:08.815 --> 19:12.148
there's no appeal, there's no safety.

19:12.565 --> 19:15.148
I do not want to frighten you,

19:15.565 --> 19:18.898
but I want to tell you the truth, it is the truth.

19:19.315 --> 19:22.565
You have to try to be good people.

19:23.981 --> 19:29.731
You have to try to be really good character people.

19:30.148 --> 19:34.023
I am told some people who are in Sahaja Yoga

19:34.399 --> 19:40.023
indulge in money laundering and all that.

19:40.815 --> 19:43.731
Also some of them have very bad characters,

19:44.190 --> 19:46.148
they run after girls

19:46.482 --> 19:50.981
and they try to look at the girls and all sorts of things.

19:51.023 --> 19:55.898
Now this has ruined the west especially.

19:56.315 --> 19:59.690
Also our Indians are learning from it.

20:01.731 --> 20:05.690
As it is, we have to respect ourselves.

20:05.731 --> 20:12.023
If we don't respect ourselves, and we try to misbehave,

20:15.856 --> 20:20.399
I can only help you with your Kundalini.

20:22.190 --> 20:26.690
But if you go too much beyond it,

20:26.815 --> 20:30.190
Ekadesha Rudra will catch, no doubt.

20:32.690 --> 20:37.856
It's a very big barrier on your forehead.

20:38.898 --> 20:47.815
Eka-desha Rudra, and it is so effective nowadays, so much active.

20:48.190 --> 20:52.607
All kinds of diseases which are coming out, is all incurable,

20:52.940 --> 20:55.023
are because of Ekadesha.

20:57.482 --> 21:04.690
And also those who are suffering from possessions.

21:06.690 --> 21:10.315
The other day I met somebody who was very much caught-up.

21:12.690 --> 21:15.898
And the Ekadesha was working.

21:16.315 --> 21:21.773
I found out that he is very fanatically

21:21.981 --> 21:26.690
influenced by something.

21:28.690 --> 21:30.981
I don't want to name it,

21:31.315 --> 21:37.315
but these, we have found out, are not correct things.

21:38.731 --> 21:40.773
In every religion we have

21:41.065 --> 21:45.065
people who are spreading nonsensical ideas.

21:45.482 --> 21:48.981
Now if you don't have discretion about it,

21:49.065 --> 21:50.898
nobody can help you.

21:51.315 --> 21:53.898
You should have a full discretion

21:54.315 --> 21:59.981
as to what is right and what is wrong.

22:03.065 --> 22:06.482
Then Shiva is with you.

22:06.856 --> 22:09.273
But if you indulge

22:09.565 --> 22:16.856
into all such nonsensical things, it is self-destructive, I must say

22:16.898 --> 22:22.190
But to the Self which is destructive is the power of Shiva.

22:23.565 --> 22:28.190
What we call the Self here, is the power of Shiva.

22:30.565 --> 22:34.190
He destroys by many ways, by many ways.

22:36.565 --> 22:39.065
You can lose your reputation,

22:39.482 --> 22:42.065
you can lose your health,

22:43.482 --> 22:46.482
you can lose your wealth,

22:47.898 --> 22:49.856
everything can happen to you

22:50.065 --> 22:53.981
till you are completely finished and that

22:58.856 --> 23:01.565
I have known people on the death-bed also,

23:01.856 --> 23:04.856
start talking about money,

23:04.898 --> 23:07.940
'What should she get, money, how will he get money,

23:08.273 --> 23:09.357
and this and that'.

23:10.731 --> 23:12.773
Instead of talking about God

23:13.065 --> 23:16.565
or Self Realisation, they are talking like this.

23:18.357 --> 23:20.815
It's such a noble thing.

23:21.856 --> 23:27.190
But if you see Shiva, He doesn't possess anything,

23:27.649 --> 23:29.482
He doesn't want anything.

23:31.856 --> 23:33.731
Whatever you give to him,

23:33.815 --> 23:36.482
as a samarpana or anything,

23:36.856 --> 23:44.357
that He doesn't accept, and He passes on to the Shakti,

23:44.731 --> 23:46.731
"You do whatever you want to do. "

23:46.815 --> 23:51.649
She's the one who is working out everything

23:51.981 --> 23:58.065
to benefit you to make you happy. He's not bothered.

23:58.482 --> 24:02.482
In this case, you have to please Shiva!

24:02.898 --> 24:05.357
He will not try to please you,

24:05.731 --> 24:08.731
you have to go all the way to please Him.

24:08.815 --> 24:13.482
It is a very difficult personality of Shiva.

24:15.898 --> 24:21.065
In the Koran, it is not written separately

24:21.273 --> 24:27.981
for Allah or for Shiva, it is not differentiated.

24:28.690 --> 24:31.898
Because the people with whom He had to deal

24:32.232 --> 24:34.898
were all uneducated, stupid people.

24:34.981 --> 24:37.649
So He didn't give all the details that

24:37.690 --> 24:40.856
God is in different forms.

24:41.232 --> 24:43.856
So there is only one Allah they know.

24:44.232 --> 24:47.898
But they don't do anything that

24:47.981 --> 24:52.649
shows the differentiations of their jobs and work.

24:54.690 --> 24:58.649
It is the Shakti who loves, I agree.

24:58.690 --> 25:03.524
But She too, can get angry very much.

25:05.898 --> 25:08.856
And once She gets angry, there is no end to it!

25:12.232 --> 25:15.065
Now I have to tell you, as Sahaja Yogis,

25:15.524 --> 25:19.981
that you develop your qualities to please the Shiva.

25:23.357 --> 25:30.649
It's too much of hankering, too much of 'wants'.

25:32.981 --> 25:36.856
All this is not necessary.

25:37.232 --> 25:41.524
Of course I want you to live well, and beautifully,

25:41.690 --> 25:45.148
not stupidly - to go into jungles

25:45.524 --> 25:48.649
or to behave like hippies - that's not the point.

25:48.690 --> 25:50.524
The point is,

25:50.898 --> 25:59.524
from your heart, the attachment to things must go away.

25:59.898 --> 26:04.357
A person who is a Shiva Bhakti

26:07.815 --> 26:10.524
- he doesn't care for money, he doesn't know about money.

26:11.399 --> 26:16.815
He is a very generous person, extremely. He's just generous.

26:16.856 --> 26:21.898
People may say, "Stupid"- the way he goes on, the way he works it.

26:21.981 --> 26:25.148
But I don't think so.

26:25.524 --> 26:33.856
That's not at all the description.

26:37.981 --> 26:40.649
The description of a man

26:40.981 --> 26:47.981
who is a bhakta of Shiva has no interest in money,

26:48.399 --> 26:50.399
is very generous.

26:50.815 --> 26:54.856
Anything you ask from that, he'll give.

26:55.232 --> 26:57.690
Mahavira's was like that.

26:57.731 --> 27:03.898
Mahavira had gone for his meditation in his own garden

27:05.148 --> 27:12.399
and Vishnu as Shri Krishna

27:12.815 --> 27:14.232
came and told him that,

27:14.690 --> 27:16.524
"See, I have no clothes.

27:16.898 --> 27:21.524
You have got this cloth, why don't you give me half of it?"

27:21.898 --> 27:28.815
He said, "All right, you can have it. You can have the whole. "

27:29.898 --> 27:36.023
Because he said this, "My house is here, I'll just wear my clothes"

27:36.399 --> 27:38.524
What he did was not

27:38.981 --> 27:43.815
to show that nudity is a very great thing.

27:43.856 --> 27:46.315
But if you see the Jains, what to do,

27:46.690 --> 27:54.815
they make big, big statues of Mahavira

27:55.023 --> 27:57.815
showing Him completely nude.

27:57.856 --> 28:00.981
I mean, this is the perversion of human mind.

28:02.023 --> 28:03.981
Why He did it, we should know.

28:04.023 --> 28:07.148
He was so detached, so detached, to

28:07.524 --> 28:10.898
give away the clothes, what is the harm?

28:11.315 --> 28:13.815
It was not to show-off or anything.

28:13.898 --> 28:19.565
But the generosity, people don't understand.

28:19.981 --> 28:23.315
And the Jainies are the least generous!

28:26.023 --> 28:32.731
So the quality of all these great incarnations is also not understood.

28:33.148 --> 28:41.315
Because a kind of an illusion is there.

28:41.690 --> 28:48.731
For example, Shiva is always with very few clothes, very few.

28:51.148 --> 28:55.315
And what does he eat? No-one knows.

28:56.690 --> 29:01.565
What is his desires and what does he want? No-one knows.

29:02.981 --> 29:07.815
A person with a great knowledge of music will sing before him,

29:07.898 --> 29:08.981
He's alright.

29:09.023 --> 29:12.731
Or even any madcap comes and sings, He's alright.

29:15.190 --> 29:17.731
For Him it doesn't matter,

29:18.190 --> 29:23.731
He's not meticulous about how the music is and what the notes are,

29:24.190 --> 29:27.315
whether it is alright or not, no.

29:27.690 --> 29:29.981
He is beyond all these things.

29:30.023 --> 29:34.565
He is beyond all these formalities that we have about everything,

29:34.981 --> 29:37.815
he is beyond.

29:38.190 --> 29:43.482
He is spirituality itself, he is beyond all these things.

29:43.856 --> 29:49.148
Whether you are a musician or you are an artist,

29:49.482 --> 29:54.482
whatever it is you are, He'll enjoy.

29:54.856 --> 29:58.898
He's the enjoyer, and He'll enjoy -

29:59.315 --> 30:05.315
whatever is simple, whatever is given with the heart, He'll enjoy.

30:05.690 --> 30:08.690
Whatever is expressed with the heart, He'll enjoy.

30:08.815 --> 30:13.023
He is not a conditioned person,

30:13.482 --> 30:17.898
that it should be modern, it should be such and such.

30:18.315 --> 30:19.856
He is not conditioned.

30:19.898 --> 30:24.856
He doesn't think that way like human beings who will sit down

30:24.898 --> 30:30.065
and make a meticulous everything, does it fit into it or not.

30:30.482 --> 30:33.981
Even, even for art,

30:34.065 --> 30:39.856
even for anything that is created out of somebody's heart,

30:39.898 --> 30:43.315
they will try to discourage that person.

30:44.731 --> 30:49.065
I have seen people, they have such conditioning.

30:49.482 --> 30:52.856
And one thing about Shiva, he has no

30:52.898 --> 30:56.482
conditioning of anything, nothing.

30:57.065 --> 30:59.981
That's why they call him a mast-maulaa

31:00.065 --> 31:02.898
- He is not at all conditioned.

31:03.357 --> 31:05.898
If you have any conditioning in your mind,

31:06.107 --> 31:07.898
then you are not a Shivabhakta.

31:08.357 --> 31:11.482
It's all right, you should dress up well, you should do this …

31:11.856 --> 31:15.482
but you should not have conditioning that 'If you don't do that

31:15.856 --> 31:23.898
you are being out of cast, out of fashion, out of this …'.

31:25.357 --> 31:30.357
It is very difficult for people not to accept.

31:31.731 --> 31:35.065
All kinds of fashions are coming nowadays, all kinds.

31:35.482 --> 31:38.981
I tell them, "What is this?" "Oh this is the fashion. "

31:39.065 --> 31:42.190
Is it some God behind this fashion,

31:42.649 --> 31:45.815
or is there some deity who is telling you these fashions?

31:46.190 --> 31:48.649
Today it comes, tomorrow it will disappear.

31:49.815 --> 31:51.731
So, what I am saying,

31:51.815 --> 31:55.981
that if you have to worship Shiva,

31:56.065 --> 31:58.981
you should de-condition yourself.

31:59.731 --> 32:02.815
You are living in the world of Sahasrara.

32:03.649 --> 32:07.981
Now, somebody is not properly dressed - finished!

32:08.065 --> 32:11.649
Somebody is over-popularly dressed - finished!

32:11.815 --> 32:16.649
Human beings have a capacity to criticise everyone.

32:17.981 --> 32:22.232
And to criticise everyone, this is nothing fundamental

32:22.649 --> 32:26.065
because if you do it on vibrations, one can understand.

32:26.482 --> 32:28.649
But not on vibrations, just

32:28.690 --> 32:34.065
because 'this is not the fashion, that is not the fashion'.

32:35.482 --> 32:38.981
What is the fashion of Shiva, tell me.

32:39.357 --> 32:41.482
Has He any fashions?

32:42.898 --> 32:45.232
Anything you give Him, He's happy.

32:45.649 --> 32:48.232
Whatever you give Him, He eats that.

32:48.649 --> 32:57.232
He is full of such appreciation because He is personified as Joy.

32:57.898 --> 33:00.690
He is peace and He is joy.

33:01.065 --> 33:04.731
If you are worshippers of Shiva,

33:04.856 --> 33:11.232
then you should not have any conditioning of any kind.

33:14.065 --> 33:18.232
I mean, normally I also wear simple saris, very simple.

33:18.649 --> 33:23.357
And it happens that people think I am a very poor woman.

33:23.731 --> 33:25.357
I am poor

33:26.815 --> 33:31.856
because I don't care for money, I don't bother.

33:32.232 --> 33:41.856
So, we should know that Shiva is the poorest man, purest God.

33:42.232 --> 33:47.815
He doesn't wear any alankaras, he doesn't wear anything, just

33:48.856 --> 33:51.856
he lives with his own body.

33:52.232 --> 33:58.690
Because he is nothing but embodiment of enjoyment,

33:59.148 --> 34:07.524
nothing but complete form of enjoyment and joy.

34:08.898 --> 34:13.524
So another quality of Shivabhakta* should be joy.

34:14.856 --> 34:18.524
You should be joyous about everything

34:18.898 --> 34:23.649
- whatever you see, whatever type of person you see.

34:23.856 --> 34:25.981
So the only way you can do, is

34:26.399 --> 34:30.232
give up human quality of criticism

34:33.148 --> 34:35.399
- to criticise others.

34:35.815 --> 34:38.981
Like if the English go into the Indian house,

34:39.399 --> 34:40.649
they say "We don't like it. "

34:40.731 --> 34:41.981
"Yes, what, what you don't like?"

34:42.399 --> 34:44.981
"We didn't like the carpet. "

34:45.399 --> 34:51.232
'I don't like it' itself is against your Shakti.

34:51.690 --> 34:55.690
Then, if supposing an American goes to an English home,

34:55.731 --> 34:58.815
he'll say, "I don't like it. " It's very common.

34:58.856 --> 35:02.399
All the people say "I don't like it", "I didn't like that".

35:02.815 --> 35:04.524
Who are you

35:04.898 --> 35:08.148
to say 'I don't like it' or 'I like it'.

35:08.524 --> 35:12.898
People don't realise that by saying all these things,

35:13.023 --> 35:17.524
you are showing that there is no Shiva principle in you.

35:20.898 --> 35:24.731
I can understand somebody who cannot walk, alright,

35:25.148 --> 35:30.815
for such a person is allowed to use some sticks or something,

35:30.856 --> 35:32.856
allowed.

35:33.315 --> 35:34.815
But if he says "I don't like that person

35:35.023 --> 35:37.399
because he doesn't use the stick.",

35:37.815 --> 35:41.690
shows that he is such an egoistical fellow;

35:41.731 --> 35:45.731
himself is using the stick and

35:46.065 --> 35:49.232
he wants to create what, warns or what,

35:49.440 --> 35:52.148
in a democratic country, that people should

35:52.440 --> 35:57.148
walk with the sticks in their hands. It is very difficult.

35:57.524 --> 36:00.399
In the west it is very common, you see,

36:00.815 --> 36:02.731
to have this kind of a hat,

36:03.148 --> 36:05.981
to have this kind of a dress,

36:06.023 --> 36:07.898
to wear this kind of a cheroot.

36:08.190 --> 36:11.815
All kinds of things have a conditioning.

36:12.898 --> 36:18.315
Nowadays the hairstyle has become very funny with women.

36:18.690 --> 36:21.981
Because they don't put oil in their hair.

36:23.023 --> 36:28.898
They will not have any grease in their hair.

36:29.315 --> 36:32.690
If somebody's going to meet them they will wash their hair.

36:33.731 --> 36:35.981
I don't think it looks very nice.

36:36.023 --> 36:37.315
Of course I don't say that

36:37.690 --> 36:42.565
you need not have so much of oil on your face and ears.

36:42.981 --> 36:46.023
But, what is so important?

36:48.731 --> 36:57.898
In life, is also this is another thing that we are very self-centred.

36:59.399 --> 37:01.690
We want to impress people.

37:03.190 --> 37:09.981
If I wear a dress or anything, it should impress.

37:11.023 --> 37:14.690
I mean, even it impresses - what?

37:15.731 --> 37:19.731
If a snake comes along, he will bit you, whatever dress

37:20.565 --> 37:24.190
you might be wearing, whatever country you might be from.

37:24.565 --> 37:32.315
All this kind of identification, it doesn't behove a Shivabhakta.

37:34.690 --> 37:37.315
A Shivabhakta has to be just

37:37.690 --> 37:42.315
absolutely lost in the raptures of joy.

37:44.482 --> 37:49.898
Very particular about hairdress, very particular about dresses

37:50.107 --> 37:52.856
- I don't know what they are particular about.

37:52.898 --> 37:56.898
With all that, what do they gain? Nothing.

37:58.315 --> 38:00.357
Do they become popular?

38:01.148 --> 38:03.649
And this kind of popularity,

38:03.981 --> 38:07.482
which is so skin-deep, what's the use?

38:08.856 --> 38:13.482
You must have respect, respect of your being.

38:13.856 --> 38:19.731
As not only human beings, but as Sahaja Yogis.

38:20.815 --> 38:22.856
You are Sahaja Yogis.

38:22.898 --> 38:28.565
We are Shiva's bhaktas, we don't care.

38:29.981 --> 38:31.565
We are not bothered.

38:32.898 --> 38:37.815
Whatever it is, Shiva is there within us

38:38.065 --> 38:47.898
and we shine with that power within us that is of Kundalini.

38:50.065 --> 38:52.815
You may be very well dressed, you may be anything.

38:53.190 --> 38:55.482
If your vibrations are bad, what's the use?

38:56.856 --> 38:58.649
If you cannot judge people

38:58.981 --> 39:01.649
by their vibrations,by nonsensical things

39:01.981 --> 39:07.273
like their dress and moustaches, is it of any value?

39:07.565 --> 39:12.898
In Sahaja Yoga your value system has to be Sahaj.

39:15.357 --> 39:17.565
I have seen many people,

39:17.981 --> 39:20.856
"I don't like their house, I didn't like this …"

39:20.898 --> 39:26.565
'I don't like' is the sentence, is nishidda,

39:26.981 --> 39:30.357
is to be given up by Sahaja Yogis.

39:33.731 --> 39:36.065
If you don't like anything, you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

39:39.981 --> 39:46.190
Now, of course, I mean, if there is somebody who is anti-Sahaj and all that,

39:46.649 --> 39:51.065
but still by saying 'I don't like', what are you going to gain?

39:52.981 --> 39:54.856
It's a waste of energy.

39:58.981 --> 40:03.981
Because of this, in Sahaja Yoga I have seen,

40:04.065 --> 40:08.190
people have created problems for Me, so many problems.

40:08.649 --> 40:13.065
Only because they are such much 'self' oriented.

40:15.482 --> 40:19.482
"This man is bad, that woman is bad, he is this, that …"

40:19.856 --> 40:21.190
Sometimes I am surprised.

40:21.482 --> 40:24.482
Because when those people come to me,

40:24.815 --> 40:28.065
I am amazed that they are very nice people.

40:29.482 --> 40:32.981
But people are very self-centred, also.

40:33.273 --> 40:38.065
Like I have seen people who are not bothered

40:38.482 --> 40:45.357
to come to meetings, to pujas.

40:46.731 --> 40:48.898
Because they have got work.

40:50.981 --> 40:56.981
Altogether there are eleven pujas, but they don't come.

40:59.357 --> 41:01.981
Because they are very busy.

41:03.357 --> 41:05.649
At least to one puja you should come.

41:06.731 --> 41:15.357
But those who are Shivabhaktas only enjoy nothing but pujas.

41:15.898 --> 41:17.898
Nothing else

41:18.981 --> 41:25.232
Their whole being is absolutely vibrated by Shiva bhakti.

41:25.649 --> 41:28.357
To them, that's the most important thing to do.

41:29.731 --> 41:32.649
Also there are people in Sahaja Yoga

41:32.690 --> 41:35.981
who are trying to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

41:36.357 --> 41:39.856
Very wrong, very wrong, very wrong.

41:41.232 --> 41:45.649
Sahaja Yoga is to give you punyas,

41:45.690 --> 41:48.065
to give you blessings,

41:48.524 --> 41:51.690
and if that is not in your mind,

41:52.148 --> 41:53.065
better give up Sahaja Yoga.

41:53.315 --> 41:56.649
You can join some business or something

41:56.690 --> 41:59.524
of malpractices very easily, very easily.

41:59.898 --> 42:02.148
Till you end up in the jail you are there.

42:05.524 --> 42:10.981
But to enjoy your spiritual powers

42:11.357 --> 42:13.981
you must learn certain things.

42:14.357 --> 42:17.856
And one of them is de-condition yourself

42:18.232 --> 42:21.856
- 'I don't like it' or 'I like it' -

42:22.148 --> 42:26.399
this sentence must go away from your tongue!

42:31.690 --> 42:32.815
Likes and dislikes

42:32.856 --> 42:35.815
are only for people who have limited vision.

42:38.856 --> 42:42.148
You should learn to appreciate.

42:42.524 --> 42:44.856
Your power of appreciation will show

42:45.232 --> 42:48.273
how spiritually you are endowed.

42:51.649 --> 42:57.148
And your power of observation

42:57.440 --> 42:59.649
will show what do you observe.

43:00.731 --> 43:03.524
For example, some people will come and tell me,

43:03.731 --> 43:08.148
"I didn't like that lady, she was wearing a funny sari. "

43:09.524 --> 43:11.148
I mean, what is this?

43:13.524 --> 43:18.731
"I didn't like her, because she was putting her hand on her head".

43:19.148 --> 43:21.023
So what?

43:22.399 --> 43:25.232
Because you make your own images of people, and you want

43:26.690 --> 43:29.690
everybody to be like that, otherwise you don't like it.

43:30.148 --> 43:33.815
Whether you like it or don't like it, nobody's going to change.

43:34.856 --> 43:37.148
Why waste your energy?

43:38.898 --> 43:42.232
Sometimes there are musicians who are not so good.

43:49.148 --> 43:57.315
I remember, once I went home and I asked my father,

43:57.690 --> 43:59.731
"How does this musician sing?"

44:00.148 --> 44:03.981
He says, "He's very courageous, very courageous. "

44:04.023 --> 44:05.981
I said, "Why, what happened?"

44:06.232 --> 44:10.815
He said, "He sings without bothering about it

44:10.856 --> 44:13.273
and he goes out of tune sometimes,

44:13.482 --> 44:15.690
he goes out of taala, doesn't matter,

44:15.731 --> 44:17.023
but he sings.

44:17.399 --> 44:19.148
He's very courageous, himmatwala"

44:19.524 --> 44:23.690
So, that's how he used to appreciate, I have seen.

44:23.731 --> 44:29.023
When this fellow started singing, I saw he was like that,

44:29.399 --> 44:34.399
but my father was saying "Wa-wa, wa-wa" and encouraging him.

44:34.815 --> 44:38.731
You see, I have seen in my father these divine qualities,

44:39.148 --> 44:42.023
how he used to tolerate,

44:42.399 --> 44:46.565
how he used to - I mean not tolerance also, just appreciation.

44:46.981 --> 44:50.399
Of any kind of thing he used to appreciate.

44:50.565 --> 44:53.607
That's what, if the Sahaja Yogis have that

44:53.898 --> 44:58.898
condition of appreciation they will enjoy everything.

44:59.107 --> 45:02.315
Because you kill your enjoyment, do you know that?

45:04.731 --> 45:08.315
You are all variety of people here, all variety of dresses,

45:08.482 --> 45:13.190
all variety of families and so many countries you are here.

45:13.565 --> 45:16.981
To Me you are nothing but Sahaja Yogis, my children, that's all.

45:19.023 --> 45:22.482
Now I don't go on judging you on your dress, or

45:22.649 --> 45:25.565
on what your hairstyle is, no.

45:27.023 --> 45:30.190
All modern things are extremely conditioning.

45:32.190 --> 45:38.190
And they condition you so much that you get irresponsible.

45:39.190 --> 45:41.731
As Sahaja Yogis you get irresponsible.

45:42.190 --> 45:46.981
Your first and foremost responsibility is Sahaja Yoga.

45:47.023 --> 45:49.898
Because you should know what a work it is.

45:51.315 --> 45:57.815
It is such a great work, to transform the whole world - that is My vision.

45:58.190 --> 46:01.482
And this old age I think the same.

46:01.856 --> 46:06.190
Now, if that is My vision, what should be your attitude?

46:06.565 --> 46:10.815
That we should go all out to spread Sahaja Yoga.

46:11.190 --> 46:12.898
That's the main thing.

46:13.315 --> 46:20.482
I call you for these pujas just to renovate, I should say,

46:20.856 --> 46:24.190
to give you more of energy and all that.

46:24.565 --> 46:27.399
But if you are just taking it as a great

46:27.649 --> 46:30.649
blessings and sitting at home it's of no use.

46:31.815 --> 46:33.731
You must spread Sahaja Yoga!

46:33.815 --> 46:36.981
I was surprised that they said

46:37.273 --> 46:43.482
in Lucknow there are only 200 Sahaja Yogis. How can that be?

46:43.981 --> 46:45.981
First time I went to Lucknow,

46:46.190 --> 46:48.565
there were at least three thousand Sahaja Yogis

46:48.981 --> 46:52.065
and we had not fixed any hall or anything.

46:52.482 --> 46:56.565
And can you imagine, suddenly I find so many people.

46:57.981 --> 47:00.856
How is it there can be two hundred Sahaja Yogis?

47:00.898 --> 47:06.065
Either you are telling lies, or you are good for nothing.

47:07.482 --> 47:10.482
So the responsibility of all the Sahaja Yogis,

47:10.731 --> 47:15.815
of all the Sahaja Yogis, first and foremost,

47:16.190 --> 47:17.981
is to spread Sahaja Yoga.

47:19.065 --> 47:21.190
How many people have you given realisation?

47:22.565 --> 47:24.815
Where have you talked about Sahaja Yoga?

47:25.190 --> 47:28.565
I have seen even in the plane, if you are travelling,

47:28.856 --> 47:33.607
anyone who is there will tell Me "My guru is this,

47:33.898 --> 47:36.565
you know, such a great guru, this that. "

47:36.981 --> 47:40.357
Openly, shamelessly, about horrible gurus!

47:40.940 --> 47:47.856
While you people are very shy to talk about Sahaja Yoga.

47:48.981 --> 47:52.065
Never publicly unless and until

47:52.482 --> 47:56.856
you have a programme, and public programme and all that.

47:58.981 --> 48:03.856
You have no time, also, for Sahaja Yoga, very busy people.

48:08.357 --> 48:15.607
So, if you have to follow Shiva and His blessings all the time,

48:15.815 --> 48:17.357
His protection to you...

48:17.649 --> 48:25.065
then you have to be Sahaja Yogis of very high quality.

48:27.482 --> 48:30.482
It shows when you go all out

48:30.898 --> 48:32.815
to spread Sahaja Yoga.

48:35.731 --> 48:38.065
That is the thing missing.

48:38.482 --> 48:41.357
I am very happy that in Australia

48:41.731 --> 48:44.065
Sahaja Yoga has spread so much.

48:44.482 --> 48:47.815
I don't know what has happened.

48:48.232 --> 48:51.731
In a far fetched place like Australia.

48:52.649 --> 48:55.898
In the beginning I had some set-backs

48:55.981 --> 49:00.773
but now it has spread. Also in Austria it has spread.

49:00.940 --> 49:03.649
And also in Italy.

49:05.731 --> 49:10.731
But otherwise, just doesn't spread. What's the matter?

49:10.856 --> 49:14.690
The matter is the leaders are not going all-out.

49:15.065 --> 49:18.981
Say, for in England I travelled from north to south,

49:19.357 --> 49:21.898
east to west in all the directions.

49:24.649 --> 49:30.065
We have very poor, very poor Sahaja Yogis there.

49:30.524 --> 49:35.649
You have to go to universities, to younger people.

49:36.731 --> 49:42.690
If hippy-ism can spread, why not Sahaja Yoga?

49:44.690 --> 49:50.232
It spread like wild-fire, why not Sahaja Yoga?

49:50.649 --> 49:57.232
All these things are there, which I have to warn you - be careful!

49:58.649 --> 50:02.357
If you have got Realisation, you have a responsibility

50:02.815 --> 50:07.898
- to give realisation to others, and to spread Sahaja Yoga.

50:10.981 --> 50:14.856
If you can't do it, then God save you.

50:15.232 --> 50:16.649
I have nothing to say.

50:18.690 --> 50:20.690
You have to introspect,

50:21.148 --> 50:23.148
'What have I done for Sahaja Yoga.

50:24.524 --> 50:26.148
What have I got from Sahaja Yoga?'

50:28.524 --> 50:32.357
And I am sure after this Shiva puja,

50:32.607 --> 50:37.232
you will dedicate yourself to Shiva principle within you.

50:37.524 --> 50:41.524
Shiva principle doesn't 'stir out',

50:41.898 --> 50:50.649
it's very, very stern, it's very powerful.

50:53.731 --> 50:59.148
You have to dedicate, and you have to surrender.

50:59.524 --> 51:05.856
Above every other job, above every other performance,

51:06.232 --> 51:08.148
the highest is this.

51:08.524 --> 51:16.399
So, with this, I ask Shiva to give you blessings,

51:16.815 --> 51:18.731
complete blessings,

51:19.148 --> 51:25.023
so that you get transformed into the personality of Shiva.

51:25.399 --> 51:26.782
May God bless you all
