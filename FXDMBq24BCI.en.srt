1
00:07:03,725 --> 00:07:11,348
Doctor Warren has clearly told you about these
subtle bodies within us.

2
00:07:12,374 --> 00:07:18,467
And we should think why this subtle body was
created?

3
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:24,867
What was the need to create this body within us
and how it was created?

4
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:33,465
These, all these centers, are the milestones
of our evolution.

5
00:07:33,465 --> 00:07:43,344
And as we started growing, higher and higher,
developing higher and higher awareness, we

6
00:07:43,686 --> 00:07:46,366
developed all these centers one by one.

7
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:52,837
And at the human level, it’s this center
where the man raised his head up.

8
00:07:52,837 --> 00:07:54,126
Still why?

9
00:07:54,126 --> 00:07:58,517
What was the need to create a human being?

10
00:07:58,517 --> 00:08:04,217
Supposing I’m trying to get some nuts, bolts
and things, and try to fix them up,

11
00:08:04,413 --> 00:08:07,907
make it into a good instrument.

12
00:08:07,907 --> 00:08:10,167
One would ask what are you doing?

13
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:13,027
Why are you assembling all this, what are
you making out of it?

14
00:08:13,027 --> 00:08:21,186
After all, it cannot be a waste, why such
a special thing has been made, for what purpose?

15
00:08:21,186 --> 00:08:26,237
And that is what we have not yet discovered,
what is our purpose.

16
00:08:26,237 --> 00:08:31,258
But if you go to any of the Scriptures, you’ll
find out that they have said,

17
00:08:31,258 --> 00:08:36,266
all of them have said, that you have to become your Self.

18
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:41,167
That there is All-pervading Power around us.

19
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:43,997
Now this All-pervading Power we cannot see.

20
00:08:43,997 --> 00:08:45,937
It exists.

21
00:08:45,937 --> 00:08:48,946
As they say, if you have to believe it, or
not.

22
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:52,837
But we should find out if there is such a
Power or not.

23
00:08:52,837 --> 00:09:00,369
For example, if I say that there are lots of
beautiful pictures

24
00:09:00,369 --> 00:09:05,807
and beautiful music in this area, you won’t believe it.

25
00:09:05,807 --> 00:09:13,147
But if I get you a television set and if I
plug it to the main, you starts seeing

26
00:09:13,147 --> 00:09:16,717
that it is receiving something.

27
00:09:17,364 --> 00:09:24,349
In the same way, when you become connected
with the whole,

28
00:09:25,229 --> 00:09:31,547
then what should happen to you is that you start feeling that All-pervading Power.

29
00:09:31,547 --> 00:09:33,857
This is Self-knowledge.

30
00:09:35,176 --> 00:09:42,857
And it’s written at length, very clearly,
by many people in the Indian Scriptures.

31
00:09:42,857 --> 00:09:52,516
The reason was, the people who came in the
other parts of the world,

32
00:09:52,516 --> 00:10:00,398
had such a tough time, they were not given any chance to say
anything much about it.

33
00:10:00,398 --> 00:10:09,147
Hardly they could utter anything and they
were crucified, poisoned, beaten up, tortured,

34
00:10:09,147 --> 00:10:14,647
all kinds of problems they were given.

35
00:10:15,136 --> 00:10:21,761
So this has to happen within us that you we
should feel this All-pervading Power.

36
00:10:23,152 --> 00:10:27,297
The other day, we had 2 persons from a guru
and they said,

37
00:10:27,297 --> 00:10:32,544
 "How can it be only this cool breeze that is coming in us, is something?"

38
00:10:32,544 --> 00:10:38,645
For a human being, to conceive something about
God,

39
00:10:38,645 --> 00:10:46,717
is to go to scriptures which have lasted for all these ages, to find out

40
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,072
one of the authorities you can have.

41
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:55,107
Now, it is said that there is All-pervading
power in all the scriptures.

42
00:10:56,465 --> 00:11:02,356
Now supposing, by going to somebody, he says,
"I give you power called, so called shaktipat",

43
00:11:02,356 --> 00:11:09,060
and he just starts jumping like a mad horse
or a like a mad monkey.

44
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,357
And you say, "It is shaktipat!"

45
00:11:12,357 --> 00:11:17,712
And you have vigorous movements and all kinds
of acrobats you fall into

46
00:11:17,712 --> 00:11:19,787
and you believe that this is shakti.

47
00:11:19,787 --> 00:11:24,785
And then, by the time it is over, you are
exhausted and finished.

48
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,976
How can that be a shaktipat?

49
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:37,551
The idea of energy within us is not horse
energy by which a horse can run very fast,

50
00:11:37,551 --> 00:11:41,756
that’s physical energy, we should understand.
That's just a 'prana shakti',

51
00:11:42,245 --> 00:11:46,717
part of this- just part of this path.

52
00:11:46,717 --> 00:11:49,908
It’s just a physical energy.

53
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:56,927
Now human beings don’t need a horse power,
do they?

54
00:11:56,927 --> 00:12:01,527
You have already got big cars here which have
tremendous horse powers.

55
00:12:01,527 --> 00:12:06,477
You don’t have to become horses now, or
bulls or some sort of an animal.

56
00:12:07,552 --> 00:12:11,846
Our idea of a Superman is that he will have
such power

57
00:12:11,846 --> 00:12:15,710
that he can lift the whole building and throw away somewhere.

58
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:20,757
All such absurd ideas should be given up

59
00:12:20,757 --> 00:12:25,592
and you should understand that is physical wellbeing

60
00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:35,477
so that you can feel the blessings, the
blessings of your Spirit.

61
00:12:36,943 --> 00:12:44,856
Blessing work, an animal doesn’t understand;
but a human being must understand that when

62
00:12:44,856 --> 00:12:53,787
he gets spiritually endowed and spiritually
blessed, then, first thing he should have

63
00:12:53,787 --> 00:12:57,307
is a physical wellbeing.

64
00:12:57,307 --> 00:13:04,637
That doesn’t mean that he becomes a wrestler,
That doesn’t mean that his body will be

65
00:13:04,637 --> 00:13:10,636
so built that if he slaps somebody, then the
other person will die.

66
00:13:10,636 --> 00:13:18,227
On the contrary, you become such a powerful
personality that if somebody slaps him, for

67
00:13:18,227 --> 00:13:21,967
him it’s nothing, it is all nonsense.

68
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:33,007
So the concept of human beings can be from
the kind of life they lead, the kind of media

69
00:13:33,007 --> 00:13:39,907
they face, the kind of identification the
society has, all kinds of things could be there.

70
00:13:39,907 --> 00:13:46,717
For example, for Japanese children, I was
amazed, for them the idea of a Superman is

71
00:13:46,717 --> 00:13:52,841
that he should look like a ghost, he should
at least ten times bigger than a normal human being.

72
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:55,267
And that’s what they think they should achieve.

73
00:13:55,267 --> 00:14:03,337
Because I studied their media, specially their
cinema, and most of them have produced these phantom ideas.

74
00:14:03,337 --> 00:14:07,033
We don’t become phantoms, that is one thing
one should know.

75
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:14,657
Neither we become agitated – how can we
become agitated? We are in bliss and peace.

76
00:14:14,657 --> 00:14:25,402
If you start just gesticulating and sort of shouting
 and screaming like mad, then how can that be a 'shaktipat''?

77
00:14:25,402 --> 00:14:29,919
It’s madness, you are possessed!
It's possession on you.

78
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:35,477
Anywhere you go anybody who’s possessed, you
go and see lunatics, they do the same.

79
00:14:35,477 --> 00:14:42,121
You pay these people to become lunatics, to
believe that they have given you a power,

80
00:14:42,437 --> 00:14:44,001
it’s absurd.

81
00:14:44,001 --> 00:14:51,115
Now the power that has come, is going to come
to us, has to give you a wellbeing.

82
00:14:51,115 --> 00:14:54,880
All these people if you look at them, they
are sickly people, they are reclusive.

83
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,525
They are actually frightened, some of them are
even frightened of a garlic as I told you.

84
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:08,975
So the Realization, if it comes to you, the
chakras which are placed on your fingers,

85
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:11,652
should be enlightened, minimum of minimum.

86
00:15:11,652 --> 00:15:16,131
And that you should be able to feel this All-pervading Power that is there.

87
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:21,236
This is Self-knowledge, this is 'atma bodha'.

88
00:15:22,126 --> 00:15:29,491
'Bodha' means to know; to know, to feel that
power.

89
00:15:29,491 --> 00:15:32,033
Even, after Realization  [...]

90
00:15:32,033 --> 00:15:38,082
when you grow a little bit more,
 you start seeing comma like powers,

91
00:15:38,082 --> 00:15:49,270
 it’s just like, you can say a – in
English I don’t know- small sparklers of commas,

92
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:53,765
 you can see it clearly. You can also see the Kundalinis of the people.

93
00:15:53,765 --> 00:16:01,497
You can also see a good soul and a bad soul like dots, you can clearly start seeing, once you get your Realization,

94
00:16:01,497 --> 00:16:03,172
 when you are at that level, you start seeing.

95
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:07,529
But if you get possessed, say you are on the
left-hand side, then what will you see?

96
00:16:07,823 --> 00:16:10,335
You’ll see ghosts walking into your house.

97
00:16:10,335 --> 00:16:12,597
You’ll say your room is lifted up.

98
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:16,717
Suddenly you’ll find your body is taken
away and you are somewhere hanging.

99
00:16:16,717 --> 00:16:21,881
All these are very, very dangerous things
about which people are not aware.

100
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:25,919
Never go near these things and these people.

101
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:30,718
Recently there’s a big disease that has
started, which is a very dangerous disease

102
00:16:30,718 --> 00:16:34,021
I don’t know if you people, are aware of
it or not.

103
00:16:34,021 --> 00:16:39,076
That when small children are sleeping in the
day time, say they are in Switzerland.

104
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:45,161
And say, their mother may be in America.

105
00:16:45,161 --> 00:16:47,037
The timings are different.

106
00:16:47,037 --> 00:16:50,647
That time, it may be the night and here it
may be the day time.

107
00:16:50,647 --> 00:16:54,657
And the mother goes to a clairvoyant and says
that: “I would like to speak to my child”.

108
00:16:54,657 --> 00:16:56,717
“All right”.

109
00:16:56,717 --> 00:17:06,717
So the child is sleeping and this clairvoyant
gets a soul around, and asks the soul to get the soul of the child

110
00:17:07,823 --> 00:17:13,207
and the mother can hear the voice of the child,
 sitting down here.

111
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:19,676
“Oh, I’m speaking without any telecommunication
I’m talking to this child”.

112
00:17:19,676 --> 00:17:26,616
And it’s very common that the child dies
in sleep and the mother doesn’t know.

113
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:35,015
Because the soul has to return, and if it
does not return properly,

114
00:17:35,406 --> 00:17:41,004
if something goes wrong in his return, the child suffers and also,

115
00:17:41,004 --> 00:17:50,545
the soul suffers in any case when
it leaves the body and it is very dangerous to human life

116
00:17:50,545 --> 00:17:57,597
And we go headlong into it and we destroy
ourselves.

117
00:17:57,597 --> 00:18:01,390
They are very, very cunning people I tell
you.

118
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:06,717
Yesterday, those two people who were discussing
me, arguing with me, they told me that their guru

119
00:18:06,717 --> 00:18:08,717
thinks very highly of me.

120
00:18:08,717 --> 00:18:15,098
And there also, people have heard they told me that our guru said that, You don’t go to Her

121
00:18:15,098 --> 00:18:20,824
because She will only accept you if you are absolutely purified and we have to purify you".

122
00:18:20,824 --> 00:18:23,449
All this is nonsense!

123
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:31,285
These people are just playing tricks on your
mind. The purification takes when the Kundalini
rises.

124
00:18:31,285 --> 00:18:33,085
She purifies you.

125
00:18:33,085 --> 00:18:37,879
Because you come to know about yourself when
the Kundalini rises, face the problem.

126
00:18:38,355 --> 00:18:41,421
And once you know the problem you correct
yourselves.

127
00:18:41,775 --> 00:18:46,976
Kundalini awakening gives you the judgement
of your own Self

128
00:18:46,976 --> 00:18:50,735
as if you are going in the car

129
00:18:50,735 --> 00:18:56,717
 and you get out of the car to see what’s
wrong with the car.

130
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,190
It is very simple when the Kundalini rises
to correct you.

131
00:19:02,581 --> 00:19:05,879
For example, supposing there’s a person
who smokes too much.

132
00:19:06,717 --> 00:19:09,950
I may tell him, "Don’t smoke, don’t smoke", all that.

133
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:14,345
He gets tired of me, run away, won’t see me again.

134
00:19:14,345 --> 00:19:17,124
There is no need to tell you don’t smoke.

135
00:19:17,124 --> 00:19:20,847
Once you get your Self-realization, you won’t
smoke at all.

136
00:19:20,847 --> 00:19:24,796
Little willpower will work it out,  in the
first instance.

137
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:31,282
But even if it doesn’t act in the first instance,
gradually you will just drop it out

138
00:19:31,282 --> 00:19:34,866
because of transmutation that takes place.

139
00:19:34,866 --> 00:19:40,622
So we have to see that when we say that we
have got some sort of a shakti or a power within us,

140
00:19:40,622 --> 00:19:52,191
we should become master of ourselves,
of our greed, of our desires and of our aggressive nature.

141
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,923
We should become the master of that.

142
00:19:54,923 --> 00:19:59,612
Unless and until that happens to us, how should
we believe that it is innate power?

143
00:19:59,612 --> 00:20:03,845
and that we should feel this All-pervading, blissful
Power around us.

144
00:20:03,845 --> 00:20:08,162
Unless and until you’re awakened to that,
how can you see?

145
00:20:08,162 --> 00:20:12,677
Unless and until you eyes are open, how will
you see that?

146
00:20:12,677 --> 00:20:16,717
And that awakening is enlightenment.

147
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:21,539
Now you are so beautifully made inside see,
already you are made like that.

148
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:24,331
Already you are made like that.

149
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:33,575
Except that if you are not ruining it, by breaking
it completely, you are there!

150
00:20:33,575 --> 00:20:42,939
His made, for which you have not paid anything.
 You are putting no effort, no jumping, nothing.

151
00:20:42,939 --> 00:20:49,860
You have become a human being from a monkey,
without cutting your tails.

152
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,710
Automatically, spontaneously.

153
00:20:52,710 --> 00:21:01,070
And if you have to become anything higher, you will become, spontaneously.

154
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:10,413
The only difference is that, at this stage
of evolution, you have been given your freedom to chose.

155
00:21:10,413 --> 00:21:15,770
Because at a high level when you will move,
you have to be free people.

156
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:20,290
And that freedom is to be respected this is one point.

157
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:27,212
And the second point is that your Realization
has to take place in your human awareness,

158
00:21:27,212 --> 00:21:28,742
you should know!

159
00:21:28,742 --> 00:21:32,878
When you became a human being from a monkey stage, you never knew how you became.

160
00:21:32,878 --> 00:21:35,463
But now you must know!

161
00:21:35,463 --> 00:21:41,939
Because you must know that there is God
and you must know that his power is flowing to you.

162
00:21:44,698 --> 00:21:50,724
That’s why one should understand what we
should expect when we get our Realization.

163
00:21:50,724 --> 00:21:55,569
Of course, as we said, that when you start
getting the power within you,

164
00:21:55,569 --> 00:22:02,373
once it starts working, then you can learn about it, how
you manifest it, how you use it.

165
00:22:02,373 --> 00:22:07,650
First, when electricity was discovered, nobody
knew that it will have so many uses.

166
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:12,077
But then you discover how many uses it has!

167
00:22:12,077 --> 00:22:16,430
But here, you don’t even have to discover it.

168
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:22,356
If it is told that this has this use, you
just try and see for yourself, it has or not.

169
00:22:22,356 --> 00:22:28,426
It’s like, you get, say, a car, you purchase
a car and they give you everything in writing,

170
00:22:28,426 --> 00:22:33,907
"Now try this one. If you press this button, that will
happen. If you  press that button, that will happen."

171
00:22:33,907 --> 00:22:37,877
In the same way, the whole thing is invented

172
00:22:37,877 --> 00:22:44,597
completely decorated for you to use this power

173
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:52,678
to manoeuvre it, to handle it and to manifest it.

174
00:22:55,024 --> 00:23:03,409
We have no self-esteem. If we had self-esteem, we should understand that

175
00:23:03,409 --> 00:23:08,146
God has created you with such difficulties, whatever it is

176
00:23:08,255 --> 00:23:15,013
Thousands of times, thousands of years it
has taken for you to become a human being.

177
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:21,802
And that you must be something special, much
higher than animals, no doubt about it;

178
00:23:21,802 --> 00:23:25,683
and that it should happen to you.

179
00:23:25,683 --> 00:23:30,819
It is He who loves you. It is He who is the father.

180
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:38,377
His compassion, love and the greatest father
that you could think of, who wants to share.

181
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:42,050
He wants to give his kingdom to you.

182
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:46,797
You must have that self-esteem that you are a human being.

183
00:23:46,797 --> 00:23:55,081
I think somehow, perhaps, because of these conditionings you have had,

184
00:23:55,081 --> 00:24:00,557
you think, “How can we get Realization so easily?”
You can’t believe it.

185
00:24:00,557 --> 00:24:06,553
You don’t want to believe it.
You think, ‘How can we be Realized so easily?”

186
00:24:06,553 --> 00:24:11,617
Because everything you do in life, you think
you have to struggle.

187
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:15,851
But there are so many things you don’t do with struggle;

188
00:24:15,851 --> 00:24:18,824
like, you get a fruit without any struggle.

189
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:23,174
Even if you breath, all your autonomous nervous system works without any struggle.

190
00:24:23,174 --> 00:24:27,070
You eat and the food is digested automatically.

191
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:32,541
You don’t have to struggle for it, you don’t have to jump or do jogging or anything like that.

192
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:35,905
It just works out.

193
00:24:36,296 --> 00:24:44,072
We should understand it is the blessing, it’s the blessing.

194
00:24:44,072 --> 00:24:53,305
People have become so much science oriented that they have forgotten that science also is a blessing.

195
00:24:53,305 --> 00:24:57,758
Science is a blessing now, for example,
see this photograph of mine here.

196
00:24:57,758 --> 00:25:04,496
I had gone to a village and the village, which had no electricity, nothing,

197
00:25:04,496 --> 00:25:09,026
had a very old building of a school, I was sitting outside.

198
00:25:09,026 --> 00:25:15,736
And the photograph caught on these falling rains,
the photograph!

199
00:25:15,736 --> 00:25:18,127
Your camera has caught it.

200
00:25:18,127 --> 00:25:24,733
I went to Hong Kong on the Television, and they asked me,

201
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:30,210
because the person who was owning the television,
his daughter, invited me

202
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:34,819
And she said, "Mother, can we ask people to put their hands towards you, like this?"

203
00:25:34,819 --> 00:25:37,748
I said, "All right. Let’s start."
And they got Realization,

204
00:25:37,748 --> 00:25:40,990
so many of them! They wrote letters that,
"We got Realization."

205
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:45,042
On the television!

206
00:25:45,042 --> 00:25:51,049
Even on the telephone, you can give Realization,
on the telephone you can save people.

207
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:56,717
All this science has created, it's for Sahaja Yogis and for Sahaja Yoga.

208
00:25:56,717 --> 00:26:01,258
It is a blessing to communicate the message.

209
00:26:01,258 --> 00:26:04,968
But, people are so blind, so blind,

210
00:26:04,968 --> 00:26:13,769
that they think all this has been given to us to make more money and to create more plastics.

211
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:23,735
They cannot believe that this is to communicate about God’s love, his compassion

212
00:26:23,735 --> 00:26:32,543
 and that security that is from the most loving Father you could think of.

213
00:26:32,543 --> 00:26:38,844
It is beyond human conception to understand his compassion, I accept.

214
00:26:38,844 --> 00:26:44,607
But still you see compassion in life and if He is the source of compassion

215
00:26:44,607 --> 00:26:48,269
then what must be his level of compassion?

216
00:26:48,269 --> 00:26:54,375
Now as it is, he [Warren] has told you all about this quite a lot and I have also yesterday told you

217
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:59,210
And he said that I have only one more lecture to cover the whole subject, I don’t know what’s going to happen,

218
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:04,512
how far I can go with people in New York.

219
00:27:05,001 --> 00:27:10,080
I think we may have one more lecture when I come back, one more lecture might be.

220
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,328
But today, I think I should talk to you about the Self, first of all,

221
00:27:14,328 --> 00:27:17,843
then about all these things, it will be a better idea.

222
00:27:18,723 --> 00:27:23,802
Now what is the Self within you?

223
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:34,251
Self is the reflection of God Almighty.

224
00:27:37,528 --> 00:27:44,269
First, let us see how the creation came into being.

225
00:27:46,517 --> 00:27:50,419
In the beginning or in the end

226
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:53,160
because there is no beginning and there is no end.

227
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:58,080
Like you cannot say, "Hen came first, it came first or the egg", it’s something like that.

228
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:04,047
It started at a point, you see, when it was just all quiet.

229
00:28:04,927 --> 00:28:13,378
And the whole creation becomes

230
00:28:13,378 --> 00:28:18,355
untroubled or we can say it is sleeping.

231
00:28:18,355 --> 00:28:20,375
Everything is sleeping,

232
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:24,851
like we sleep so the whole world sleeps for us.

233
00:28:24,851 --> 00:28:29,140
That is a state that’s called as Parabrahma in Sanskrit language.

234
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,166
That is a state that’s called as Parabrahma in Sanskrit language.

235
00:28:33,192 --> 00:28:38,027
Now, in the Bible, whatever is written is very telescopic and very fast.

236
00:28:38,027 --> 00:28:41,390
And to understand it I am just trying to enlarge it

237
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:46,717
that where ever are the missing points, you can put them up.

238
00:28:46,717 --> 00:28:51,123
Now the first state is of Parabrahma

239
00:28:51,123 --> 00:29:00,128
is a state where everything is not manifesting,

240
00:29:00,128 --> 00:29:04,132
everything is sleeping.

241
00:29:04,621 --> 00:29:11,794
Then this Parabrahma becomes aware of Itself

242
00:29:11,794 --> 00:29:16,717
that It awakens as we awaken.

243
00:29:16,717 --> 00:29:21,436
Then It starts manifesting.

244
00:29:21,973 --> 00:29:26,224
All the awareness, the consciousness of that

245
00:29:26,224 --> 00:29:31,338
starts accumulating on the periphery

246
00:29:31,338 --> 00:29:41,132
and the centre remains as the Subject.

247
00:29:42,627 --> 00:29:49,290
The periphery now is the Power of that Subject.

248
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:55,638
So we had the subject, the God Almighty, is called as Sadashiva

249
00:29:55,638 --> 00:30:00,073
and his Power that is the Primordial Power,

250
00:30:00,073 --> 00:30:06,717
in Sanskrit is called as Adi Shakti,
and we call it as Holy Ghost in the Bible.

251
00:30:07,157 --> 00:30:12,053
So, they separate, I mean it’s a –

252
00:30:12,053 --> 00:30:17,223
some drawings have to be made but doesn’t matter now- I'll just tell you in short.

253
00:30:17,223 --> 00:30:23,345
And this Spectator, this Sadashiva,

254
00:30:23,345 --> 00:30:28,997
this God Almighty starts watching his own Power.

255
00:30:28,997 --> 00:30:36,046
Now we cannot understand the complete concord and complete understanding,

256
00:30:36,046 --> 00:30:42,096
complete oneness and integration between these two entities,

257
00:30:42,096 --> 00:30:48,859
God Almighty and his Power. It’s like the Sun and his rays or sunshine,

258
00:30:48,859 --> 00:30:53,294
Moon and moonlight, but even more than that.

259
00:30:53,294 --> 00:30:55,439
Nothing can come in between them.

260
00:30:55,439 --> 00:31:01,001
They are absolutely in unison with each other

261
00:31:01,001 --> 00:31:05,302
and every thing works simultaneously.

262
00:31:05,302 --> 00:31:12,496
In human relationship, no husband and wife can be like that, it’s impossible.

263
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:28,135
Then the Spectator, Sadashiva, forces his Power, which forms an entity, to create.

264
00:31:28,673 --> 00:31:31,348
First, She refuses.

265
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:38,061
And then He gives Her- I mean in a very poetic way- it’s called as a “Lasya”, means a launch.

266
00:31:38,061 --> 00:31:42,052
And that gives the first sound, Omkara.

267
00:31:42,052 --> 00:31:46,717
That’s the first, logos, the first sound, the Word.

268
00:31:46,717 --> 00:31:52,625
That’s the Word She says, She creates.

269
00:31:53,114 --> 00:31:56,717
Then She starts creating.

270
00:31:56,717 --> 00:31:59,065
She creates, She divides Herself

271
00:31:59,065 --> 00:32:03,684
First of all, She is nothing but the Power of desire.

272
00:32:03,684 --> 00:32:11,292
Because, first it is to be desired! It’s the God’s desire!

273
00:32:11,292 --> 00:32:13,765
She exists as a desire.

274
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:17,548
Unless and until there is desire, nothing can work out.

275
00:32:17,548 --> 00:32:23,909
So She is the Power of desire. like we have also the Power of desire within us.

276
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:33,628
Then from this desire, comes the other Power which makes it an act.

277
00:32:33,628 --> 00:32:39,396
So the other Power of action comes in.

278
00:32:39,836 --> 00:32:50,019
These two Powers bring forth a system in between themselves,

279
00:32:50,019 --> 00:32:53,570
like left and right,

280
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:58,182
which starts giving sustenance to things that have been created.

281
00:32:58,573 --> 00:33:04,760
As I told you that carbon has four valences, it’s a tetravalent,

282
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:10,646
I don’t know if you people have studied chemistry or not, there’s a chemical periodic table if you see,

283
00:33:10,646 --> 00:33:15,764
it’s all divided so beautifully and it is so well arranged,

284
00:33:15,764 --> 00:33:21,388
that one has to believe that there is a great Juggler

285
00:33:21,388 --> 00:33:26,300
or a great Planner who has done it, otherwise it’s not possible.

286
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:32,043
It’s so well arranged! The whole valences system and everything is so well arranged.

287
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:43,945
All this is done by the central path which gives them the sustenance, the quality that they have.

288
00:33:43,945 --> 00:33:47,176
Then the sustenance starts growing

289
00:33:47,176 --> 00:33:51,651
till you become a human being as shown here.

290
00:33:51,651 --> 00:33:57,978
In this Void, here as carbon then you move into the Void

291
00:33:57,978 --> 00:34:04,172
and here you go through all the evolution starting from a fish

292
00:34:04,172 --> 00:34:09,341
up to the human level where you become a small man.

293
00:34:09,732 --> 00:34:15,811
Once you become the small man, Vamana, is called that.

294
00:34:15,811 --> 00:34:21,172
First the man who came on this earth was a small statured man.

295
00:34:21,563 --> 00:34:31,259
Then a man came who was Parashurama, a very, very - Poseidon, a very large man, huge man.

296
00:34:31,845 --> 00:34:34,809
Two extremes.

297
00:34:34,809 --> 00:34:41,207
And then, came the man who was in the centre.

298
00:34:41,207 --> 00:34:49,285
And the leadership of all this evolution was done by the Incarnation

299
00:34:49,285 --> 00:34:54,136
of the aspect which is the evolutionary aspect.

300
00:34:54,136 --> 00:34:59,549
So the first aspect She creates is of desire aspect.

301
00:34:59,549 --> 00:35:04,251
When the desire dies, the whole thing is destroyed.

302
00:35:04,251 --> 00:35:06,913
And the Spectator is watching it.

303
00:35:06,913 --> 00:35:09,134
Spectator has a desire.

304
00:35:09,134 --> 00:35:13,257
As long as the Spectator is happy, the play goes on.

305
00:35:13,257 --> 00:35:17,973
As soon as He doesn’t like the spectacle, He disappears.

306
00:35:17,973 --> 00:35:29,172
As soon as He disappears, then the whole show is over.

307
00:35:29,172 --> 00:35:34,408
It’s for that only Spectator the whole show is there.

308
00:35:34,408 --> 00:35:39,784
So this Power of desire has to be till the end.

309
00:35:39,784 --> 00:35:44,022
Once the Power of desire is finished, then there is no more show;

310
00:35:44,022 --> 00:35:46,718
there’s no more Spectator,

311
00:35:46,718 --> 00:35:49,670
there’s no more his Power, they’re all merge together

312
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:53,111
and again become the Parabrahma status.

313
00:35:55,263 --> 00:35:57,906
Now the other Power, as I said,

314
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:01,814
which is the aspect of creation so the Creator aspect is there.

315
00:36:01,814 --> 00:36:08,415
One is the one which is the existence and the other side of the existence is the Destroyer.

316
00:36:08,415 --> 00:36:11,928
And then another aspect is of the Creator

317
00:36:11,928 --> 00:36:18,386
and the central one is the Sustainer, is the Protector.

318
00:36:18,386 --> 00:36:26,200
Out of these, this one incarnates, only one aspect

319
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,997
because it has to give a quality and the leadership.

320
00:36:30,997 --> 00:36:35,128
For example, when there was a great flood,

321
00:36:35,128 --> 00:36:38,049
then He [Vishnu] incarnated.

322
00:36:38,049 --> 00:36:41,189
He incarnated as a fish

323
00:36:41,189 --> 00:36:44,949
and the dolphin-fish. Dolphin.

324
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:48,609
I don’t know if you know about dolphins or not.

325
00:36:48,609 --> 00:36:52,893
But dolphin is a mammal and is a friend of human beings.

326
00:36:52,893 --> 00:36:58,721
So He incarnated as a dolphin-fish and saved the boat [Noa’s Ark].

327
00:36:58,721 --> 00:37:03,711
As you know, there was a boat in which people were saved.

328
00:37:03,711 --> 00:37:09,283
He saved the boat. He is the dolphin who incarnated on this Earth.

329
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:13,583
One by one, He incarnates.

330
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:19,382
Then He incarnates as a turtle,

331
00:37:19,382 --> 00:37:24,235
four legged, which comes out of the water

332
00:37:24,235 --> 00:37:29,027
to show the fishes that you can come out.

333
00:37:31,027 --> 00:37:36,301
Then, gradually He incarnates as a quadruped.

334
00:37:36,301 --> 00:37:40,696
Like that, the Incarnations — He comes as a leader.

335
00:37:40,696 --> 00:37:45,531
Somebody has to give that confidence.

336
00:37:45,531 --> 00:37:50,268
One fish comes and takes them out

337
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:54,281
and others come, they follow them up.

338
00:37:54,574 --> 00:38:00,802
As they go on improving, every time there is an Incarnation.

339
00:38:00,802 --> 00:38:05,069
And between one Incarnation and another Incarnation,

340
00:38:05,069 --> 00:38:10,240
there is a very great time

341
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,431
and that is called as 'Yugas [eras].

342
00:38:16,017 --> 00:38:21,279
Like that, these Incarnations come on this Earth.

343
00:38:21,572 --> 00:38:27,881
Plus the incarnations of the Primordial Being come in this area [Void]

344
00:38:27,881 --> 00:38:32,126
- where we can say this is the Ocean of Illusions -

345
00:38:32,126 --> 00:38:35,818
and try to save the people

346
00:38:35,818 --> 00:38:43,189
 from getting too much to that side [right] or to this side [left] as I told you yesterday.

347
00:38:44,411 --> 00:38:50,565
And that time, when they become human beings,

348
00:38:50,565 --> 00:38:55,556
then the seekers are born, which you are,

349
00:38:55,556 --> 00:39:03,070
which are the epitome, epitome of human evolution.

350
00:39:03,363 --> 00:39:12,662
Now these seekers are engulfed by forces of ignorance

351
00:39:12,662 --> 00:39:17,342
and these ignorance forces also form anti-Christ.

352
00:39:17,342 --> 00:39:25,598
They can be devilish because they think, “Why are we not there?” like a competition setting.

353
00:39:25,598 --> 00:39:31,755
And they try to retard the progress of the saints.

354
00:39:31,755 --> 00:39:37,427
That’s why a seeker, when he’s born, is attacked,

355
00:39:37,818 --> 00:39:44,121
from very childhood, immediately he is attacked.

356
00:39:44,121 --> 00:39:47,398
Even the parents may attack the seeker.

357
00:39:47,398 --> 00:39:49,588
They may act through the parents.

358
00:39:49,588 --> 00:39:54,238
If not the parents, then the society, the schools.

359
00:39:54,238 --> 00:39:56,717
They’re all the time attacked.

360
00:39:56,717 --> 00:40:05,185
The people who are attacking may not be aware of it but they are used as mediums and these people are attacked.

361
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:12,596
And with that attack, when they are absolutely in a mess,

362
00:40:12,841 --> 00:40:17,255
and they don’t know how to save themselves,

363
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:23,434
then, another Incarnation is specially made,

364
00:40:24,314 --> 00:40:29,488
is the One that manifest here

365
00:40:29,488 --> 00:40:39,079
who is the desire Power of God, but is the Destroyer part,

366
00:40:39,421 --> 00:40:49,441
who is born to destroy these evil forces, to kill them.

367
00:40:51,151 --> 00:41:03,023
This is 14 thousand years back, the first incarnation of this great Lady.

368
00:41:04,391 --> 00:41:10,888
She’s called as Jagadamba, the Mother of this world.

369
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:16,717
She comes in there [centre heart]. She saves them.

370
00:41:16,717 --> 00:41:26,235
Today is the first day, we celebrated the first day of an Incarnation

371
00:41:26,235 --> 00:41:37,041
and that is a very, very important day for Indians, because they believe in Shakti and She is the Shakti,

372
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:45,735
that she came on this earth to kill these horrible devilish incarnations

373
00:41:45,735 --> 00:41:50,678
who are called as rakshasas.

374
00:41:51,313 --> 00:41:57,368
So this part is represented within us

375
00:41:57,368 --> 00:42:07,540
at the heart level in the centre, in the vertical column

376
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:14,373
and it manifests in the children till the age of 12 in the sternum

377
00:42:14,373 --> 00:42:20,894
and creates antibodies. She creates Her army as the antibodies.

378
00:42:20,894 --> 00:42:25,614
Till the age of 12 years the children develop those antibodies within themselves

379
00:42:25,614 --> 00:42:36,415
and whenever there is a danger, whether it is physical, emotional or spiritual danger,

380
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:40,819
these antibodies fight.

381
00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:45,999
That’s why, when you are frightened, the sternum starts breathing fast

382
00:42:45,999 --> 00:42:58,205
and informs that all the antibodies should join hands to protect the subject.

383
00:42:58,596 --> 00:43:03,335
These antibodies are created here [centre heart].

384
00:43:03,335 --> 00:43:17,605
And the left hand side, left had side of this [left heart] is the essence of Motherhood.

385
00:43:17,947 --> 00:43:25,181
If in your childhood, your Mother had played a role

386
00:43:25,377 --> 00:43:34,760
which has given you fears or kind of a frightening experience, then this center goes out.

387
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,476
We say the left heart is catching.

388
00:43:38,965 --> 00:43:43,670
Sometimes, if you are a bad mother also it might catch.

389
00:43:44,012 --> 00:43:50,033
The right heart is the one, is that of the father.

390
00:43:50,033 --> 00:43:57,696
And the fatherhood is expressed by the leader who came on this earth about 8 thousand years back,

391
00:43:57,696 --> 00:44:00,140
who is called as Shri Rama.

392
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:04,052
He is not - if  you see here, He’s in the center.

393
00:44:04,052 --> 00:44:10,307
To make him a complete human being, He was pushed onto the right-hand side.

394
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,044
He is Shri Rama.

395
00:44:13,044 --> 00:44:20,935
Shri Rama came on this earth to establish the institution of benevolent king.

396
00:44:21,717 --> 00:44:28,070
The political development and the political evolution started from his side.

397
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:32,714
He is the one who gave leadership as a benevolent king,

398
00:44:32,714 --> 00:44:43,807
the one who represents God and who is a king. The idea of a king related to God came from Shri Rama.

399
00:44:43,807 --> 00:44:49,487
But the modern Kings are not like that, they have no relation with God.

400
00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:56,085
On the contrary, they are horrid people. Some of them are nothing but satanic people.

401
00:44:56,085 --> 00:44:58,774
Absolutely Satan they are!

402
00:44:58,774 --> 00:45:03,806
And you can see from the way they lead their lives and they have led their life before

403
00:45:03,806 --> 00:45:09,919
So the benevolence of Shri Rama is here to be followed

404
00:45:09,919 --> 00:45:17,469
by all the political leaders and all the people who are at the helm of affairs.

405
00:45:17,469 --> 00:45:21,943
He is the ideal that was created for human beings,

406
00:45:21,943 --> 00:45:29,454
to run their authority as the head,

407
00:45:29,454 --> 00:45:36,717
or the loving compassionate benevolent leader of the people,

408
00:45:36,717 --> 00:45:41,796
who has to govern them by making them respectful,

409
00:45:41,796 --> 00:45:45,070
by respect.

410
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:54,748
And if human beings create such kings who are not respectable,

411
00:45:54,748 --> 00:46:00,230
 those who have no human values, those who have no moral courage,

412
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:04,576
those who are selfish, those who are self-centred,

413
00:46:04,726 --> 00:46:08,841
then they have nothing to do to be there.

414
00:46:09,525 --> 00:46:13,983
So this is the position of Rama who is the father.

415
00:46:13,983 --> 00:46:20,377
So the head of every state has to be the father of his subjects,

416
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:28,392
that’s what He has tried to show by his life. So much so that He had to sacrifice his beloved Wife,

417
00:46:28,392 --> 00:46:31,814
whom He loved so much.

418
00:46:32,254 --> 00:46:37,596
But these days, you know, how people do for their own children, they’ll sell the whole country.

419
00:46:37,596 --> 00:46:40,525
In our India, they do it.

420
00:46:40,525 --> 00:46:47,323
Here it’s just the other way round, nobody cares for children at all and nobody knows whose children they are.

421
00:46:47,323 --> 00:46:55,318
But in India it’s the other way round, that they will even sell their country for their children.

422
00:46:55,318 --> 00:47:00,907
All these two extremes go against the character of Shri Rama.

423
00:47:01,836 --> 00:47:07,195
Now this is the character that was created 8 thousand years back.

424
00:47:07,195 --> 00:47:13,949
So I’ve explaining to you all these things.
Now this is the heart. In the heart resides the Spirit.

425
00:47:13,949 --> 00:47:20,853
The Spirit is watching the game of this creation,

426
00:47:21,391 --> 00:47:30,456
and is watching what is happening to this person, this person, to this person, to this person.

427
00:47:30,456 --> 00:47:37,091
Every body has got in their heart the Spirit

428
00:47:37,091 --> 00:47:40,979
which is watching.
It’s called as the “cetana” [consciousness],

429
00:47:40,979 --> 00:47:44,229
means the one, the knower of the field.

430
00:47:44,229 --> 00:47:51,874
So, he’s watching every minute; he knows what you do, when you go, what mistakes you create, he watching,

431
00:47:51,874 --> 00:47:54,819
he doesn’t interfere.

432
00:47:54,819 --> 00:47:59,364
He’s only- the interference comes from here [Swaddisthan?], from that thing,

433
00:47:59,364 --> 00:48:03,619
He tries to give you conscience, he tries to improve you.

434
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:08,740
From here sometimes [Mooladhara], the wisdom part, he tries to tell you, “Be in the center”

435
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:12,707
by punishing you and showing it is wrong.

436
00:48:12,707 --> 00:48:19,103
But he’s just watching the game, “Let’s see how far it goes.”

437
00:48:19,103 --> 00:48:23,165
He is 'the knower of your field'.

438
00:48:23,165 --> 00:48:27,291
He is the Universal Being within you.

439
00:48:27,291 --> 00:48:34,231
He is the reflection of that God Almighty who’s the Spectator within you.

440
00:48:34,671 --> 00:48:43,152
And his Power is this All-pervading Power which has created all this [the subtle system].

441
00:48:43,787 --> 00:48:50,692
So to feel this All-pervading Power, you have to become the Spirit.

442
00:48:50,692 --> 00:48:54,639
All this creation has no meaning if you do not become the Spirit.

443
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:59,589
In the Vedas, the first, the very first stanza says that,

444
00:48:59,589 --> 00:49:03,193
"By reading Vedas, if you do not become Vedis [ wise men]

445
00:49:03,193 --> 00:49:07,472
-Vedinies- 'Veda' word comes from 'vidya'. Vidya means to know;

446
00:49:07,472 --> 00:49:12,492
if you don’t become the knowledge, then it has no meaning.

447
00:49:12,492 --> 00:49:21,838
But knowledge doesn’t lie in dancing and shouting and all the monkey tricks that people do;

448
00:49:22,132 --> 00:49:24,331
it’s no monkey tricks there.

449
00:49:24,673 --> 00:49:32,814
Knowledge is that you become the Self, you feel the All-pervading Power and by which you know everything else.

450
00:49:32,814 --> 00:49:39,316
That is Self-knowledge and that is what we have to achieve.

451
00:49:40,098 --> 00:49:47,296
If you do not want to become your Spirit,
I’m sorry, I’ve nothing to offer.

452
00:49:47,296 --> 00:49:53,637
If you have some other things in your mind, you can go away from here, but no use arguing it,

453
00:49:53,637 --> 00:50:00,430
 there should be no argument about it.
If you don’t want to become, I have nothing to say,

454
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:04,048
I’ve nothing else to offer or to request you.

455
00:50:04,048 --> 00:50:12,333
I would request you that you become your Spirit, then we’ll talk about it.

456
00:50:12,333 --> 00:50:17,220
And when you become your Spirit - there’s a very good book

457
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:20,618
written by Adi Shankaracharya in the 6 century,

458
00:50:20,618 --> 00:50:24,797
the one who was the first Shankaracharya, nowadays all of them are horrible ones.

459
00:50:24,797 --> 00:50:30,952
One of them is now making a big umbrella of gold, set with diamonds, imagine!

460
00:50:30,952 --> 00:50:36,717
He’s a short fellow. I said,
"This umbrella will fall upon him one day".

461
00:50:36,717 --> 00:50:41,461
He’s trying to compete with Pope.

462
00:50:41,461 --> 00:50:45,860
And this Adi Shankaracharya has said that,

463
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:53,703
"Nothing can work it out, no Yoge, no shankye, no. All these philosophies are useless.

464
00:50:53,703 --> 00:50:59,573
It only works out- no discipline, nothing-

465
00:50:59,573 --> 00:51:02,390
by the Grace of the Mother;

466
00:51:02,586 --> 00:51:09,228
by the Grace of the Mother who is the Kundalini herself, She’s the Primordial Kundalini.

467
00:51:09,228 --> 00:51:15,278
Only by the awakening of the Kundalini it works out. It’s clearly given but you people do not read those books.

468
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:21,044
Today is the name of the Goddess. Ten of them are nothing but the different chakras,

469
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:24,898
where She resides in the Mooladhara. She resides in the Swadhishthana.

470
00:51:24,898 --> 00:51:31,789
She resides in the Manipura, She resides in the - what you call - this Hridaya (heart) chakra.

471
00:51:31,789 --> 00:51:36,725
Then She resides in the Vishuddhi, then into Agnya, and then into Sahasrara.

472
00:51:37,311 --> 00:51:39,802
 All these names are given there.

473
00:51:39,802 --> 00:51:45,649
Of course, it was not so clearly said as it is said today because the time was not there to say.

474
00:51:45,649 --> 00:51:50,661
But all these things are there: how she rises, how she breaks all these “granthis”

475
00:51:50,661 --> 00:51:55,034
which are between these two chakras, are the “granthis” means the knots.

476
00:51:55,034 --> 00:51:57,803
 It’s so clearly given.

477
00:51:57,803 --> 00:52:01,112
It’s never given that you start jumping like a monkey,

478
00:52:01,112 --> 00:52:03,758
or you take out your clothes.

479
00:52:03,758 --> 00:52:08,455
All this nonsense is not there, on the contrary, it is said that this is all possession.

480
00:52:08,455 --> 00:52:14,323
You get “bhootagrasta”, means you get possessed by the dead.

481
00:52:14,616 --> 00:52:16,717
It’s so clearly given!

482
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:25,708
But people don’t read these books: they jump onto people who have come here to show some sort of a mesmerism

483
00:52:25,708 --> 00:52:28,124
and accept it. But you are seekers.

484
00:52:28,124 --> 00:52:32,795
I would request you, you are seekers, first of all know that you are seekers

485
00:52:32,795 --> 00:52:37,340
and don’t be deluded by these false tricks.

486
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:43,302
Do not waste your energy on these false things, you’ll become your Self.

487
00:52:43,302 --> 00:52:46,987
Of course, it goes without saying that

488
00:52:46,987 --> 00:52:52,460
the change, the transformation, comes in, in your awareness,

489
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:56,663
first of all, in your awareness.

490
00:52:56,663 --> 00:53:03,639
Not in jumping and none of all these nonsensical things. I mean people think that if you become a stupid fellow,

491
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:05,154
then your awareness has improved.

492
00:53:05,154 --> 00:53:10,285
Transformed, after all, after all you are transformed, you see, your were a sane person, you’ve become stupid.

493
00:53:10,285 --> 00:53:13,165
You are transformed in any case.

494
00:53:13,165 --> 00:53:19,250
If you become mad, then is it a greater transformation. Mother says, “All right, transformation. You have become mad!"

495
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:25,677
You're sane people, you are landing in a lunatic asylum, you are transformed. And also transmutation has taken place.

496
00:53:25,677 --> 00:53:29,782
"Because now we wear dresses like lunatic people,

497
00:53:29,782 --> 00:53:32,745
we behave like lunatic people, transformation has taken place".

498
00:53:32,745 --> 00:53:38,099
It’s an ascent of the mind, you have to ascend.

499
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:43,936
Your awareness has to ascend and not to descend. It’s very easy to descend.

500
00:53:43,936 --> 00:53:50,871
To move on to the left or to the right is not the way, but to move here into Super Consciousness.

501
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:54,924
And that’s one thing one should know, should happen to you.

502
00:53:54,924 --> 00:53:59,736
That is the Self-knowledge. That is the thing one has to get

503
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:06,961
is to awaken these centres within you which are represented on your fingers here,

504
00:54:06,961 --> 00:54:13,836
seven of these are shown here and then to feel the All-pervading Power to begin with.

505
00:54:13,836 --> 00:54:17,611
Once it has happened, then to know how to discern,

506
00:54:17,611 --> 00:54:22,544
how to decode, how to find out, how to improve, how to go further with it.

507
00:54:22,544 --> 00:54:25,224
First of all, get the connection!

508
00:54:25,224 --> 00:54:29,909
If your car has not yet started, what are you doing about it?

509
00:54:29,909 --> 00:54:37,447
It’s so simple and such a common sense, but I don’t know how these people have taken over it.

510
00:54:37,838 --> 00:54:44,774
The only problem, as I told you before, is this, that God has given you freedom.

511
00:54:45,165 --> 00:54:48,436
And that freedom is to be respected.

512
00:54:48,436 --> 00:54:54,015
But if you go to these people, you don’t ask any questions, you do as others are doing, just like monkeys.

513
00:54:54,015 --> 00:54:58,320
You don’t even think why they are doing it. I mean you see that it is so filthy!

514
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:03,501
Like a gentleman who came to me, who went to a guru, and he was absolutely ruined.

515
00:55:03,501 --> 00:55:06,042
 I said:  "How could you do it? You are an Indian.

516
00:55:06,042 --> 00:55:09,951
Don’t you know that this is not to be done?" He said, "I just tried to see.

517
00:55:09,951 --> 00:55:16,098
Just out of curiosity I went there. And then I also started jumping and I got into it".

518
00:55:16,489 --> 00:55:22,003
And for five years he was in it, he could not know that he was in it.

519
00:55:22,003 --> 00:55:26,380
I said, "For Indians they have some wisdom because they have read all these things, they know all about it.

520
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:28,726
How could you do it?"

521
00:55:29,068 --> 00:55:34,932
They know that unholiness is not the way to God.

522
00:55:34,932 --> 00:55:45,120
Now, some of them can give you also an explanation that all your- you are to be cleansed.

523
00:55:45,706 --> 00:55:50,466
And you pay for it as if you go to some a laundry here, you pay for it,

524
00:55:50,466 --> 00:55:55,360
you put yourself into it, go into some turnings and you become cleansed.

525
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,760
You are to be cleansed.

526
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,298
You must see their life pattern, you see, you must see how they live.

527
00:56:01,298 --> 00:56:04,835
The person who cannot even smell a flower how can he cleanse you?"

528
00:56:04,835 --> 00:56:10,755
 He himself needs a lot of treatment.

529
00:56:10,755 --> 00:56:16,037
Flower he cannot smell, can you imagine a man like that who cannot smell a flower?

530
00:56:16,037 --> 00:56:19,369
I mean he’s a dumb personality I would say,

531
00:56:19,369 --> 00:56:25,335
the most beautiful thing that is produced is a flower, how is he going to feel the human flowers?

532
00:56:25,335 --> 00:56:28,318
How is he going to enjoy?

533
00:56:28,709 --> 00:56:35,551
A person who cannot take out his goggles from his eyes and can’t face people,

534
00:56:35,551 --> 00:56:40,141
 how can you believe that such a man could be something holy?

535
00:56:40,141 --> 00:56:45,204
Any holy person doesn’t have this kind of eyes.

536
00:56:45,204 --> 00:56:53,023
One has to know that if the person doesn’t lead a holy life and parasites,

537
00:56:53,365 --> 00:57:00,092
greedy  people, asking for money and Roll Royce and things like that, how such people, you think they can be a guru?

538
00:57:00,092 --> 00:57:03,506
You have no self esteem I should say.

539
00:57:03,506 --> 00:57:06,717
They are absolutely devils.

540
00:57:06,717 --> 00:57:11,518
But the problem in this, for me, the problem is very, very different.

541
00:57:11,518 --> 00:57:17,742
Krishna has said, "Yada yada hi dharmasya glanir bhavati bharata…

542
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:23,754
Paritranaya sadhunang vinashay cha dushkritam
…sambhabami yuge"

543
00:57:23,754 --> 00:57:30,978
He said that, "Whenever there is the degradation of the sustenance,

544
00:57:30,978 --> 00:57:40,575
then, to save the Saints and to kill the Satanics,

545
00:57:40,575 --> 00:57:47,270
I come on this earth and take a form."

546
00:57:47,563 --> 00:57:54,870
Now the problem is, all the Saints have got these Satanics in their heads. My problem is very complicated.

547
00:57:54,870 --> 00:58:00,589
I know they are Saints, I know there are the ones who are seekers and have been for ages,

548
00:58:00,589 --> 00:58:06,478
but they are impressed by the Satanics and the Satanics are ruling.

549
00:58:07,211 --> 00:58:14,665
So if any- if the question of killing, 'samarak', of Krishna  comes in, you see, even if they are killed

550
00:58:14,665 --> 00:58:18,231
they are in your brains, then how can you kill?

551
00:58:18,231 --> 00:58:25,509
They have to go out of your brain. The complicated structure today of the seekers is this,

552
00:58:25,509 --> 00:58:31,664
that in their brains they have got all the Satanics centred, they cannot get rid of it.

553
00:58:31,664 --> 00:58:33,701
They are so impressed!

554
00:58:33,701 --> 00:58:40,853
Yesterday, the fellow said, "But Mother, everything is good, there is nothing like evil." I said, "Really?"

555
00:58:40,853 --> 00:58:53,676
You can imagine To believe in such a thing

556
00:58:53,676 --> 00:58:56,318
Then why do you need discrimination? Go ahead.

557
00:58:56,318 --> 00:59:01,048
Whether you go to hell or to heaven what does it matter? If there is no evil,

558
00:59:01,048 --> 00:59:07,382
enjoy your Hell! Have a holiday!

559
00:59:08,115 --> 00:59:13,609
Christ has so many times said about the Satan.

560
00:59:13,609 --> 00:59:18,471
Not only but He said that the Satan tried to tempt Him.

561
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:25,704
He has talked of Satan and still, how do you believe that there is no evil? I just can’t understand.

562
00:59:31,138 --> 00:59:36,572
There is not only evil but the darkness is so great

563
00:59:36,572 --> 00:59:43,010
that we are standing at a point so precariously placed,  very precarious placed

564
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:51,171
 that people are more impressed by evil than by good. See how many people we are. Just see for yourself.

565
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:58,162
Here we are for reality, you cannot pay for anything, you get your Realization,

566
00:59:58,162 --> 01:00:01,015
50% people have got Realization here,

567
01:00:01,015 --> 01:00:04,418
but how many people there are? And they have no patience even to sit down

568
01:00:04,418 --> 01:00:09,639
but I’ve known people: "I’ve been with a guru for 8 years. He is in my heart".

569
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:15,188
The heart is all catching and you’re fainting all the time with the guru being there.

570
01:00:15,432 --> 01:00:19,658
The very big problem which you should realize these are all saints.

571
01:00:19,903 --> 01:00:25,670
My only concern is to save them.

572
01:00:26,110 --> 01:00:33,624
There are very subtle methods of sabotising of destroying the work of God.

573
01:00:33,624 --> 01:00:41,150
And you should know, when you get your Realization, that you have to become strong pillars of God’s work

574
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:51,750
and not indulging into frivolous, useless, cheep things. But get to it, learn it, master it. You’ll become your own master.

575
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:56,638
These gurus who have no powers, nothing, they have become gurus and have minted so much money out of you

576
01:00:56,638 --> 01:01:01,445
and you are the people who are Realized souls and you are so quiet.

577
01:01:01,445 --> 01:01:07,750
You should shout at the top of houses and say that these are false people,

578
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:15,268
these are fake people. Christ himself has said that there will be false and fake gurus.

579
01:01:15,268 --> 01:01:19,068
And then people said that, "Why are you talking against them?"

580
01:01:19,068 --> 01:01:24,689
 He said, "The Satan is are not going to talk against himself, his house".

581
01:01:24,689 --> 01:01:28,403
He said it clearly.

582
01:01:28,892 --> 01:01:35,213
And when people tell me, "Mother, don’t talk against them". I say, I always tell them, "I’ll talk, not only talk,

583
01:01:35,213 --> 01:01:39,699
but where ever it is possible, I'll tell them definitely,

584
01:01:39,699 --> 01:01:46,717
I'll verily say that these are Satan whom I know now for ages, for thousands of years, I’ve known them,

585
01:01:46,717 --> 01:01:51,500
each one of them, all their tricks I know. I know what they do to you.

586
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:57,132
And don’t listen to them that they are cleansing you. Let them cleanse themselves and repent

587
01:01:57,132 --> 01:02:01,812
so that they don’t go back into Hell permanently.

588
01:02:02,056 --> 01:02:09,327
So here, at this stage of the Mother, She’s terrific.

589
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:17,931
She protects you. She has many antibodies.

590
01:02:17,931 --> 01:02:29,117
Actually, these antibodies were created at a particular time when it was said that there was a Satan who could not be killed

591
01:02:29,117 --> 01:02:34,969
 by the quadruped and the people who have two legs like human beings.

592
01:02:35,799 --> 01:02:47,234
So She created a special type of  a – gnat, you call that gnat? A black thing, with six legs,

593
01:02:47,234 --> 01:02:53,508
and She killed him. And these antibodies are those with the six legs.

594
01:02:53,508 --> 01:02:56,258
And they worked it out.

595
01:02:56,258 --> 01:03:00,595
There are there and She’s the one who protects us.

596
01:03:01,328 --> 01:03:09,266
Now, coming to the gross level, when a lady is worried

597
01:03:09,266 --> 01:03:16,924
about her security, which is very common in America, because husbands, if they have flirts,

598
01:03:16,924 --> 01:03:23,326
if they have no time for their wives, and if all the time, they tell the wife that, "You may have to leave the house",

599
01:03:23,326 --> 01:03:29,004
they develop the fear in this area [heart centre].

600
01:03:29,004 --> 01:03:40,358
And the disease which is caused by that is breast cancer, which is very common in America, breast cancer.

601
01:03:41,092 --> 01:03:45,734
Breast cancer is caused to women who have a sense of insecurity.

602
01:03:45,734 --> 01:03:49,280
In Sahaja Yoga, you can cure breast cancer.

603
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:54,508
It’s very easy to cure breast cancer in Sahaja Yoga.

604
01:03:54,801 --> 01:04:00,284
Now the combination of this and this gives you asthma.

605
01:04:00,284 --> 01:04:06,295
Among men who have asthma, they must look after their fatherhood.

606
01:04:06,637 --> 01:04:11,652
Their own father- supposing somebody’s father is dead

607
01:04:11,994 --> 01:04:17,287
without the knowledge of the man or the father can possess also.

608
01:04:17,287 --> 01:04:21,069
In that case, you get this kind of a thing.

609
01:04:21,069 --> 01:04:26,717
Surprisingly, recently in London, one doctor, I don’t know how,

610
01:04:26,717 --> 01:04:32,875
he experimented with a lady that was suffering from anorexia.

611
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:39,208
Her father had died and she would not eat her food.

612
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:44,435
And many of them are like that whose father has died, they suffer from anorexia.

613
01:04:44,435 --> 01:04:51,500
And he said, "All right, let us see about your father. Let us do some sort of a ceremony for him."

614
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:55,585
And she started eating all right, it’s most surprising.

615
01:04:55,585 --> 01:04:58,307
It came in the paper that he did that.

616
01:04:58,307 --> 01:05:05,526
That is how you can cure such women who suffer from a deficiency of a fatherhood;

617
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:13,468
or may be we can say, if the father possessed you, if the child is thinking of the father all the time,

618
01:05:13,468 --> 01:05:15,835
all these things can be cured in Sahaja Yoga,

619
01:05:15,835 --> 01:05:21,092
which, I’m sure, when you will go further in the studies of Sahaja Yoga,

620
01:05:21,092 --> 01:05:27,286
you will learn one by one, how to cure such people who have these diseases.

621
01:05:28,459 --> 01:05:36,156
Now, I think I’ll leave these three centres for tomorrow and I’ll try to cover it up.

622
01:05:36,156 --> 01:05:41,056
But this is the Spirit that is still watching.

623
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:44,943
When the Kundalini –this is the seat of the Spirit -

624
01:05:44,943 --> 01:05:49,248
when the Kundalini rises and she touches that seat,

625
01:05:49,248 --> 01:05:56,717
immediately, you get connected to the Spirit.

626
01:05:56,717 --> 01:06:01,459
And the Spirit, which is this All-pervading Power

627
01:06:01,459 --> 01:06:08,633
starts flowing through your hands as well as you start feeling it outside.

628
01:06:09,024 --> 01:06:15,720
The Spectator, the Witness, who was outside our central nervous system,

629
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:21,041
now comes into our central nervous system and we know everything about it.

630
01:06:21,041 --> 01:06:25,976
 as we start using this power of Spirit.

631
01:06:25,976 --> 01:06:29,785
If you remember, Christ was touched by some woman who was sick,

632
01:06:29,785 --> 01:06:34,235
and He felt the power flew to her and this is the same thing.

633
01:06:34,235 --> 01:06:41,002
But Christ was different. He was All-pervading Power. He was Omkara,

634
01:06:41,002 --> 01:06:44,814
that’s why He could walk on the water.

635
01:06:44,814 --> 01:06:52,389
But about Christ and about Shri Krishna, I’ll tell you later on, tomorrow, if you don’t mind.
