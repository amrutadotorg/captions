10:27.980 --> 10:33.800
It’s such a great thing to meet your children
after such a long time.

10:33.800 --> 10:43.050
And
this country was really pestered with cold

10:43.050 --> 10:47.890
so I had to come here I think, just to make
you feel warmer with love.

10:47.890 --> 11:02.210
It’s a very heartening thing to see so many
people who are in England, who are Sahaj Yogis.

11:02.210 --> 11:16.850
As you know England has to do tremendous effort
to keep Sahaja Yoga afloat; not only that,

11:16.850 --> 11:23.040
but you have to set in examples for others.

11:23.040 --> 11:30.320
As England is the heart of the universe it
circulates.

11:30.320 --> 11:33.840
Whatever example you set in, circulates.

11:33.840 --> 11:36.290
People try to follow you.

11:36.290 --> 11:42.490
As I have told you before also, that English
people should not try to follow other people

11:42.490 --> 11:46.600
but establish their own proper character.

11:46.600 --> 11:54.640
But not to be insular by which you don’t
appreciate anybody else or you cannot understand

11:54.640 --> 11:57.620
international relationships.

11:57.620 --> 12:13.010
We are one world and it’s only one great
Viraat in Whose being we circulate.

12:13.010 --> 12:22.340
Moreover for the people who are from the heart,
[they] have to be much more open and moving

12:22.340 --> 12:29.340
and giving because that’s the job of the
cell of blood that passes through [the] heart;

12:29.340 --> 12:51.190
and that’s how you are made specially for
this.

12:51.190 --> 12:59.120
I have been speaking after you finished your
tour on a subject in India.

12:59.120 --> 13:05.640
But I think it is more related to us here
in the West than to Indians.

13:05.640 --> 13:14.790
And that is something we have to understand:
that we are in the midst of terrible conditions,

13:14.790 --> 13:23.150
horrible conditions which are taking us to
hell.

13:23.150 --> 13:41.220
And we realise how important it is for us
to get together and save this area which we

13:41.220 --> 13:44.680
called as ‘the Western world’.

13:44.680 --> 13:52.600
So I have already given a little talk which
you may hear when you have this seminar or

13:52.600 --> 13:55.560
this Shiv puja.

13:55.560 --> 14:06.700
But I would like to tell you about it: that
Shri Krishna, a long time back, told that

14:06.700 --> 14:14.310
the roots of the awareness are in the brain,
but the human awareness grows downward.

14:14.310 --> 14:20.960
That’s how we have grown downward.

14:20.960 --> 14:35.010
We have grown towards things which, if allowed
to grow that way, may take us away completely

14:35.010 --> 14:36.230
from the roots.

14:36.230 --> 14:46.530
Now if you start the movement, as I said,
from Bhavasagara, from the evolutionary process,

14:46.530 --> 14:49.560
of going downward.

14:49.560 --> 14:59.880
Now in the Bhavasagara that is in the viscera
of the stomach and all these places, we have

14:59.880 --> 15:04.160
a capacity, what we call as of consumption.

15:04.160 --> 15:09.850
We can even consume the poison.

15:09.850 --> 15:17.490
The liver can consume the poison; it has the
capacity to consume the poison as heat and

15:17.490 --> 15:26.290
then it delivers the heat to the water of
the bloodstream.

15:26.290 --> 15:35.620
So the capacity we have to consume all those
things makes us, what we call ‘swahaa’:

15:35.620 --> 15:39.910
‘swahaa’ means ‘consumption’.

15:39.910 --> 15:46.450
And from this consumption, when we consume
all these things: we consume our ego, we consume

15:46.450 --> 15:52.080
our conditioning, we consume all those things
which are detrimental to our growth [then]

15:52.080 --> 15:54.090
we become ‘swadhaa’.

15:54.090 --> 15:58.730
‘Swa‘ is the Spirit and ‘dha’ is the
dharma.

15:58.730 --> 16:04.060
We get the dharma of the Spirit.

16:04.060 --> 16:10.370
And you know what is the dharma of the Spirit
is – is Sahaj, Sahaja.

16:10.370 --> 16:18.050
But when we start going downward only with
our awareness, from the Nabhi Chakra we start

16:18.050 --> 16:25.590
moving downward, what happens to us [is] that
we move to the second position of Swadhishthana

16:25.590 --> 16:31.850
and the Swadhishthana has got the essence,
I mean, has got the capacity to be ‘bhurvah’.

16:31.850 --> 16:38.440
‘Bhurvah’ means the whole Creation, the
universe that is created.

16:38.440 --> 16:42.550
That’s how we get creativity through Swadhishthana.

16:42.550 --> 16:50.940
So when we start moving downward, what happens
to us [is] we go to all the stars and the

16:50.940 --> 16:55.040
planets and all that are created, that’s
what we are doing, wasting our energy for

16:55.040 --> 16:56.520
nothing at all.

16:56.520 --> 17:01.330
But apart from that in the wrong way when
we move, our attention goes to creativity

17:01.330 --> 17:12.990
which is destructive, which is negative, which
brings death, which suggests insipidness.

17:12.990 --> 17:17.260
Like the art today is, when you see the art,
you don’t know whether to vomit, to run

17:17.260 --> 17:20.550
away or to cry.

17:20.550 --> 17:25.550
So that explains why people are producing
such horrid things and when you look at them

17:25.550 --> 17:29.280
you don’t understand what is this going
on.

17:29.280 --> 17:40.710
So the art, the creativity, in every way,
the creativity of every kind becomes so horrid.

17:40.710 --> 17:44.270
So the third stage is that we go to ‘bhuh‘.

17:44.270 --> 17:48.380
‘Bhuh’ is this Mother Earth.

17:48.380 --> 17:52.900
Mother Earth is the one which also creates
Shri Ganesh.

17:52.900 --> 17:57.980
Now when we go towards Mother Earth we start
extracting Mother Earth, taking out all that

17:57.980 --> 18:02.780
is precious, that is needed out of proportion
– because we have got machines.

18:02.780 --> 18:05.090
Now we have got machines so we must produce.

18:05.090 --> 18:11.400
The machine must produce more and more and
more, out of proportion it should go on.

18:11.400 --> 18:17.950
And when it wants to continue it has to go
on that way so that you feed the machine to

18:17.950 --> 18:23.090
produce more.

18:23.090 --> 18:28.700
Now this production is useless!

18:28.700 --> 18:31.060
There is no need to have so much production
for us.

18:31.060 --> 18:37.390
You see plastics after plastics, then there’s
nylons after nylons, then there’s all kinds

18:37.390 --> 18:41.810
of polyester and I don’t know all kinds
of things that they have started producing.

18:41.810 --> 18:44.300
All man-made nonsense that they have.

18:44.300 --> 18:47.120
There’s no need to have so much.

18:47.120 --> 18:52.370
Then we go on accumulating things and that’s
how we become extremely materialistic people.

18:52.370 --> 18:57.900
Actually to be materialistic in the real sense
is that we understand the value of matter.

18:57.900 --> 19:00.360
And the value of the matter is aesthetics.

19:00.360 --> 19:03.380
Artistic things, real artistic things.

19:03.380 --> 19:10.490
And beyond that the value of matter is that
you can give love to others through that matter:

19:10.490 --> 19:14.350
by giving as presents, by your generosity.

19:14.350 --> 19:15.880
So you lose that also!

19:15.880 --> 19:17.420
That power also you lose.

19:17.420 --> 19:25.140
That is, you start extracting your Mother
Earth in such a way that you don’t know

19:25.140 --> 19:30.600
what to do with the acid gas that is coming
out of these productions and then all your

19:30.600 --> 19:32.310
trees are getting destroyed.

19:32.310 --> 19:33.590
It’s so destructive.

19:33.590 --> 19:36.760
The whole thing is so destructive.

19:36.760 --> 19:45.670
So then you move to the essence of Mooladhara
which is innocence.

19:45.670 --> 19:49.730
And when it is innocence, you start attacking
innocence.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.810
Now you read horrible things, when you come
here.

19:51.810 --> 19:57.170
I got the jitters when I heard about the six
year old girl and a three year old girl: I

19:57.170 --> 19:58.170
just can’t bear it.

19:58.170 --> 20:02.800
Supposing that was my child what would have
happened to me?

20:02.800 --> 20:03.800
And it’s my child.

20:03.800 --> 20:04.960
That’s how I feel.

20:04.960 --> 20:10.680
Then we are attacking the innocence everywhere
in every place and we have no sense of Mooladhar.

20:10.680 --> 20:13.590
That’s how we go down.

20:13.590 --> 20:17.990
And one step forward where do we go?

20:17.990 --> 20:20.370
Into hell.

20:20.370 --> 20:21.370
That is our movement.

20:21.370 --> 20:23.390
We are going towards hell!

20:23.390 --> 20:27.570
Straight forward, our movement is towards
hell!

20:27.570 --> 20:32.430
Because I have explained in that little talk,
you can hear it again, that, when you see

20:32.430 --> 20:38.110
the steps, you see the downward steps, then
you just see the platforms which are very

20:38.110 --> 20:43.750
good, maybe of marble, very attractive, very
sensational, whatever you may call it.

20:43.750 --> 20:47.270
And you feel like going down, it’s easy
to go down with the gravity because you have

20:47.270 --> 20:56.120
come out from amoeba state or even earlier
from carbon stage, so you feel it’s easy

20:56.120 --> 20:57.430
to go down.

20:57.430 --> 21:03.820
It’s much easier to go down, so you go on
stepping on these steps and go down.

21:03.820 --> 21:05.610
You don’t see the heights.

21:05.610 --> 21:11.920
But when you are going higher, rising higher
then you start seeing the heights.

21:11.920 --> 21:16.020
And when you see the heights what do you see
from down below?

21:16.020 --> 21:17.350
Absolutely this is our task.

21:17.350 --> 21:20.740
From the hell we have to pull out people up.

21:20.740 --> 21:21.740
That’s hell!

21:21.740 --> 21:25.520
And this is what we call as the ‘adhogati’
– going downward.

21:25.520 --> 21:27.240
‘Adhogati’ – going downward.

21:27.240 --> 21:31.540
We have to take to ‘Urdhvagati’ ( ऊर्ध्वगति)-
going higher.

21:31.540 --> 21:33.990
How do we go higher?

21:33.990 --> 21:35.860
Only Kundalini is the way.

21:35.860 --> 21:37.730
That you can see clearly.

21:37.730 --> 21:42.830
Even people who try to go higher without the
Kundalini, say from Nabhi upwards, how do

21:42.830 --> 21:43.830
they do it?

21:43.830 --> 21:50.470
They go up to mana, this is the emotional
side, that’s the motherhood.

21:50.470 --> 21:52.750
And you go against the mother.

21:52.750 --> 21:57.980
When you go there what you find [is] that
you get attached to this woman, that woman,

21:57.980 --> 21:59.020
then that thing.

21:59.020 --> 22:04.420
It goes on to this family, to other things
and again you come down.

22:04.420 --> 22:10.520
Then you go ahead, you go into ‘janah’
– is the one which is what we call ‘the

22:10.520 --> 22:11.830
public’, ‘the others’.

22:11.830 --> 22:14.480
‘Janah’ is ‘the public’, is the Viraata’s
place.

22:14.480 --> 22:16.390
As you know this is the Viraata’s place.

22:16.390 --> 22:23.190
And when you go to that place, to Viraata’s
place, what happens to you [is] that you start

22:23.190 --> 22:26.110
becoming very conscious of yourself, “Oh,
I am a public man.

22:26.110 --> 22:27.370
I am a public person.

22:27.370 --> 22:28.580
This is my reputation.

22:28.580 --> 22:30.730
I am this and I am that."

22:30.730 --> 22:34.750
And then you start exploiting people with
your politics and all other things like that.

22:34.750 --> 22:43.440
And you develop your egos; all kinds of nonsensical
things.

22:43.440 --> 22:50.110
With your mana, from your centre heart, you
develop also your conditionings and that’s

22:50.110 --> 22:56.500
how you develop a funny personality which
is not urdhvagati, which is not going higher,

22:56.500 --> 23:03.790
but is actually giving you additional problems
on your back!

23:03.790 --> 23:10.160
Then the third thing is here at the Agnya,
as I told you, you develop your ego.

23:10.160 --> 23:15.540
The other day Patrick rang me up to say, “Mother,
why are we developing our Agnyas so much nowadays?”

23:15.540 --> 23:18.500
I said, “Stop reading newspapers!”

23:18.500 --> 23:23.910
The prime ministers are fighting for their
seats and this and that and if you read newspapers

23:23.910 --> 23:27.520
you will also feel that you are a prime minister
[and] you better fight it.

23:27.520 --> 23:34.050
Because when you see a picture or any drama
sometimes you get identified and you think,

23:34.050 --> 23:37.980
“I am Napoleon myself!”

23:37.980 --> 23:41.920
So don’t read newspapers!

23:41.920 --> 23:47.710
Don’t read about these mad people who are
just trying to overpower each other.

23:47.710 --> 23:50.000
Like this [Ferdinand] Marcos fellow.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.460
The other day somebody said that, “Mother,
you get rid of this Marcos!”

23:52.460 --> 23:53.860
Now he’s out!

23:53.860 --> 23:55.990
So many will be out but what about us?

23:55.990 --> 23:58.610
Do we have some of them within our heads?

23:58.610 --> 24:06.040
Do we also have the same ideas of materialism
or ego or all these trips that these people

24:06.040 --> 24:07.890
have had?

24:07.890 --> 24:13.700
So as a result, when you see these things,
on the contrary, you should try to avoid it

24:13.700 --> 24:17.650
and jump on to urdhvagati.

24:17.650 --> 24:22.110
Then you go higher, from there, in the head
is the Sat, is the Truth.

24:22.110 --> 24:26.660
That’s what you discover, Truth; should
discover in the normal way.

24:26.660 --> 24:33.790
But in the abnormal conditions when you try
just to climb up to the brain, what happens

24:33.790 --> 24:40.180
is that whatever you know through your mental
conception becomes the truth.

24:40.180 --> 24:41.180
Everyone is like that.

24:41.180 --> 24:45.060
You see, about religion you will find a person
believes that, “This is the truth.

24:45.060 --> 24:46.550
Now this is the truth!”

24:46.550 --> 24:53.610
“I am the one who represents Christianity”,
“I am the one who represents Mohammad Sahib”,

24:53.610 --> 24:59.690
“I am the one who represents Nanak Sahib”,
“I am the one who represents Shri Rama,

24:59.690 --> 25:01.190
Shri Krishna."

25:01.190 --> 25:02.380
None of them represent.

25:02.380 --> 25:04.350
It’s just a concept.

25:04.350 --> 25:08.680
And with that concept if you move about like
that then what happens [is] you just get stuck

25:08.680 --> 25:10.290
on to that idea.

25:10.290 --> 25:13.390
That is how fanaticism comes in as far as
religion is concerned.

25:13.390 --> 25:19.910
There are many, many things like that, “This
is a concept and that’s the fact, and that’s

25:19.910 --> 25:23.180
the truth and that’s what I believe in this!”

25:23.180 --> 25:25.390
But why do you believe in that?

25:25.390 --> 25:27.560
Who are you?

25:27.560 --> 25:30.950
When they say, “I believe,” just go and
ask them, “Who are you after all to believe

25:30.950 --> 25:31.950
in that?”

25:31.950 --> 25:32.950
That’s Mr.

25:32.950 --> 25:34.450
Ego, that’s all.

25:34.450 --> 25:37.370
Then there are people who are conditioned.

25:37.370 --> 25:41.390
And that’s what, whatever is their conditioning,
they think, “This is the conditioning.

25:41.390 --> 25:42.830
This is the thing I am brought up.

25:42.830 --> 25:47.670
This is how I have lived and this is how I
am, and this is what is the truth."

25:47.670 --> 25:52.400
Both things are absurd, mythical.

25:52.400 --> 25:56.180
That’s not the Truth.

25:56.180 --> 26:02.850
So when you start through your urdhvagati,
through your Kundalini you see the height.

26:02.850 --> 26:04.890
You see that, “Now we have to rise!

26:04.890 --> 26:05.890
We have to rise.

26:05.890 --> 26:06.890
Rise with our innocence.

26:06.890 --> 26:08.250
We have to get to our innocence."

26:08.250 --> 26:12.030
We have to be innocent people.

26:12.030 --> 26:16.610
But even in Sahaja Yoga you will find some
people, I call them sometimes like monkeys,

26:16.610 --> 26:18.830
jump from urdhvagati to adhogati, adhogati
to urdhvagati.

26:18.830 --> 26:25.230
You don’t know which side they are going!

26:25.230 --> 26:27.940
You have to hold on to these steps which you
have got.

26:27.940 --> 26:29.480
First is the innocence.

26:29.480 --> 26:35.450
Your morality, as you call that, or a chastity.

26:35.450 --> 26:38.960
That’s the first step you have to achieve.

26:38.960 --> 26:45.660
Unless and until you achieve that step how
are you going to go further?

26:45.660 --> 26:46.740
But it’s the other way round.

26:46.740 --> 26:51.240
They think if you tell something very truthfully
to Mother, “I have had five love affairs,

26:51.240 --> 26:57.270
I have had six abortions, ten this thing,
then Mother is going to be very happy with

26:57.270 --> 27:00.160
me,” because they have told the truth.

27:00.160 --> 27:02.900
That’s not the truth.

27:02.900 --> 27:05.580
That’s not what is wanted.

27:05.580 --> 27:07.280
Are you now a chaste person?

27:07.280 --> 27:13.890
Have you got the ideas of chastity and dharma?

27:13.890 --> 27:17.450
That is the second step you can move into.

27:17.450 --> 27:23.210
Aesthetically, are you rich aesthetically,
are you generous?

27:23.210 --> 27:26.690
Can you appreciate the art of every country?

27:26.690 --> 27:30.160
Or you just say, “Oh it’s not good because
it’s not English!”?

27:30.160 --> 27:32.620
Or “It’s not good because it’s not French!”?

27:32.620 --> 27:34.440
Or maybe, “It’s not from Wimbledon!”

27:34.440 --> 27:38.340
Could come to that point!

27:38.340 --> 27:40.830
I mean, what is happening to us?

27:40.830 --> 27:49.290
We are becoming so insular, so small, so narrow
in our outlook, that’s impossible.

27:49.290 --> 27:52.470
We cannot appreciate another person at all.

27:52.470 --> 27:57.200
You ask anyone, everybody has an opinion about
others, what about yourself?

27:57.200 --> 27:59.540
What is your opinion about yourself?

27:59.540 --> 28:02.950
Can you laugh at yourself?

28:02.950 --> 28:07.240
And when I am giving lecture we also sometimes
think that Mother is talking about somebody

28:07.240 --> 28:08.450
xyz, not about me.

28:08.450 --> 28:10.270
That’s not so.

28:10.270 --> 28:15.100
We have to project to ourselves and find out:
are we in chastity?

28:15.100 --> 28:16.630
Are we in dharma?

28:16.630 --> 28:17.630
Have we achieved that?

28:17.630 --> 28:20.510
Have we achieved our innocence?

28:20.510 --> 28:29.190
Have our eyes achieved that innocence, that
simplicity, that power?

28:29.190 --> 28:38.210
So then we move up higher on the bhurvah state
where we have to know: are we aesthetically

28:38.210 --> 28:39.780
equipped?

28:39.780 --> 28:45.900
Do we have proper aesthetics?

28:45.900 --> 28:52.770
In our behaviour, in our dress, in our lifestyle,
in everything?

28:52.770 --> 28:56.390
Or are we still going on with the same things?

28:56.390 --> 29:00.420
Like some hippies when they come to Sahaja
Yoga, it’s impossible to make them understand

29:00.420 --> 29:06.250
that – no more hippies now!

29:06.250 --> 29:11.140
Then some come from another group, another
funny style, then they have the same style

29:11.140 --> 29:12.350
of behaviour.

29:12.350 --> 29:13.350
No!

29:13.350 --> 29:19.000
‘Sahaja’: we have to be in the Sahaja
style, which is a common style for all the

29:19.000 --> 29:23.880
Sahaja Yogis all over the world to dress up
decently, to talk decently, to have sweet

29:23.880 --> 29:29.420
words, no harsh words, no anger, no temper,
nothing of the kind.

29:29.420 --> 29:36.150
But very, very gentle and a dignified personality.

29:36.150 --> 29:42.900
Now here some of the so-called dignified also
can be very bhootish, I have seen that.

29:42.900 --> 29:47.100
They can be very dignified and they can be
very inauspicious.

29:47.100 --> 29:53.490
So another quality of innocence, which is
auspiciousness; or we can say the combination

29:53.490 --> 29:56.150
of innocence and bhurvah state is auspiciousness.

29:56.150 --> 29:57.990
Does your house give auspiciousness?

29:57.990 --> 29:59.850
Does your countenance give auspiciousness?

29:59.850 --> 30:01.950
Is your talk auspicious?

30:01.950 --> 30:10.120
Is it a mantra when you talk?

30:10.120 --> 30:15.460
Have you purified yourself so much that everything
that you do, every movement that you have,

30:15.460 --> 30:18.050
is auspicious?

30:18.050 --> 30:22.420
Is it blissful to be in your house?

30:22.420 --> 30:24.420
To be in your company?

30:24.420 --> 30:25.420
To be with you?

30:25.420 --> 30:26.420
Is it blissful?

30:26.420 --> 30:31.780
Let us direct ourselves to ourselves and see
that: are we blissful?

30:31.780 --> 30:39.250
Are we emitting vibrations that are good?

30:39.250 --> 30:43.790
It’s a very tremendous task because you
have to do it!

30:43.790 --> 30:44.790
You have to do it!

30:44.790 --> 30:46.790
Nobody else is going to do it!

30:46.790 --> 30:51.230
If you want to save this world, you must know
it’s a tremendous task and one has to go

30:51.230 --> 30:58.950
into a tapah for that, to know that you have
to be pure people.

30:58.950 --> 31:00.090
Otherwise there could be hypocrites.

31:00.090 --> 31:03.950
There are many who are Sahaja Yogis and not
at all Sahaja Yogis.

31:03.950 --> 31:06.910
Sahaja Yoga is not for hypocrites at all.

31:06.910 --> 31:08.730
You cannot be a hypocrite.

31:08.730 --> 31:13.860
You have to be what you preach, what you say,
what you understand and what we stand for.

31:13.860 --> 31:19.300
It’s not like this, “Oh I am a Christian,
all right, I am a Christian, but it’s all

31:19.300 --> 31:24.820
right, I can have adulterous eyes, all right
because after all, you see it’s all allowed."

31:24.820 --> 31:26.020
“Then what else?”

31:26.020 --> 31:28.040
“Oh, I can drink, smoke."

31:28.040 --> 31:29.040
“What else?”

31:29.040 --> 31:32.790
“Oh, I can also kill some people, it doesn’t
matter you see.

31:32.790 --> 31:37.190
It’s all right I’m Christian after all."

31:37.190 --> 31:40.320
How are you a Christian?

31:40.320 --> 31:49.980
Then, “I am a Hindu, you see I am a perfect
Hindu, but doesn’t matter if I try to discriminate

31:49.980 --> 31:52.720
between Sikhs and Hindus, doesn’t matter."

31:52.720 --> 31:53.720
How, why?

31:53.720 --> 31:56.280
There’s no discrimination allowed in Hinduism.

31:56.280 --> 31:58.300
No discrimination of any kind.

31:58.300 --> 32:03.580
Everybody has the same Atma.

32:03.580 --> 32:04.720
How can you discriminate?

32:04.720 --> 32:08.320
How can you have dowry system in a Hindu society?

32:08.320 --> 32:13.020
How can you have any caste system in a Hindu
society?

32:13.020 --> 32:16.690
You cannot have, just cannot have.

32:16.690 --> 32:18.610
It’s not the religion.

32:18.610 --> 32:24.020
So they speak one thing, do another thing,
it’s all hypocrites and all fanatics.

32:24.020 --> 32:26.440
And that’s how they become fanatics!

32:26.440 --> 32:32.980
Like you ask Bishop of Canterbury, he says
that, “Holy Ghost, I don’t know, I am

32:32.980 --> 32:34.100
agnostic about it!

32:34.100 --> 32:36.770
I am doing my job!”

32:36.770 --> 32:37.860
That’s all!

32:37.860 --> 32:43.390
This kind of frivolous attitude or we can
say a very hypocritical attitude is not for

32:43.390 --> 32:44.390
the Sahaja Yogis.

32:44.390 --> 32:47.610
They have to be what they are preaching, what
they are standing for.

32:47.610 --> 32:53.230
They cannot have that kind of a personality
that one can say, “Oh, I have seen this

32:53.230 --> 32:56.820
hypocritical fellow, calls himself Sahaja
Yogi!”

32:56.820 --> 32:58.000
We can’t!

32:58.000 --> 33:03.660
There has to be somebody who is genuine, who
is real, who is truthful.

33:03.660 --> 33:08.620
We cannot live with that kind of a compromise.

33:08.620 --> 33:14.300
We have to be what we are because we have
got the light of the Spirit.

33:14.300 --> 33:23.690
So then you go ahead and you have to become
the higher personality of a guru through consumption.

33:23.690 --> 33:26.190
Consume, how much I consume!

33:26.190 --> 33:29.020
Go on consuming all the time.

33:29.020 --> 33:33.990
This time I came, I am consuming your Left
Vishuddhis, I am consuming your viruses.

33:33.990 --> 33:39.970
I don’t know, in two days I must have consumed
oceans and oceans of troubles.

33:39.970 --> 33:43.610
No, we don’t consume at all!

33:43.610 --> 33:48.190
Because if somebody says something to us we
must come back with a harsh word, somehow

33:48.190 --> 33:54.530
or other to kill that person that is finished
forever – that’s smartness.

33:54.530 --> 33:58.700
We can consume all that.

33:58.700 --> 34:01.370
That consumption is taught by Christ very
well.

34:01.370 --> 34:02.960
Can we consume?

34:02.960 --> 34:03.960
No!

34:03.960 --> 34:10.400
We come out with big, big talks and big, big
things, you see, “We must do this, we must

34:10.400 --> 34:11.400
do that!”

34:11.400 --> 34:16.140
We are not here union leaders, are we?

34:16.140 --> 34:19.020
We don’t want to appear in the newspapers
or anything.

34:19.020 --> 34:23.130
What we want [is] to consume, we are here
to consume things.

34:23.130 --> 34:28.860
Newspapers are to advertise, expand it.

34:28.860 --> 34:31.170
We are here to consume all that is bad.

34:31.170 --> 34:34.160
Do you follow your responsibility please?

34:34.160 --> 34:38.720
Consume [all] that is wrong.

34:38.720 --> 34:39.850
How do we consume?

34:39.850 --> 34:41.350
Through meditation, through prayers.

34:41.350 --> 34:44.000
Now this is happening in this country.

34:44.000 --> 34:48.040
What are we doing about it?

34:48.040 --> 34:55.480
So we have to consume it, not to get into
explosions, not to get into expressions, but

34:55.480 --> 35:00.940
to consume it.

35:00.940 --> 35:03.600
Then you become swadhaa.

35:03.600 --> 35:14.470
‘Swadhaa’ is that you become the dharma
of the Spirit – ‘swa’, ‘dha’.

35:14.470 --> 35:17.160
You sustain that dharma within yourself.

35:17.160 --> 35:18.710
Then you become that.

35:18.710 --> 35:21.350
It’s not any kind of hypocrisy about it.

35:21.350 --> 35:24.460
I mean, if I say, “Don’t drink."

35:24.460 --> 35:25.460
You shouldn’t drink wine.

35:25.460 --> 35:27.800
I don’t drink at all I mean, no question!

35:27.800 --> 35:31.720
I mean, you cannot make me drink even if you
want to.

35:31.720 --> 35:34.520
If I say, “Don’t tell lies!” then you
don’t tell lies.

35:34.520 --> 35:40.110
You don’t just do it because you have to
just say that way, or you say that, “Don’t

35:40.110 --> 35:41.110
kill!”

35:41.110 --> 35:46.990
I cannot kill anyone.

35:46.990 --> 35:49.170
I cannot be tempted.

35:49.170 --> 35:53.960
In the same way you all have to feel, “I
cannot do it, I cannot be tempted.

35:53.960 --> 35:55.410
How can I be tempted?”

35:55.410 --> 35:57.200
Say, “I shouldn’t get into tempers.

35:57.200 --> 35:59.590
I shouldn’t be angry for nothing at all."

35:59.590 --> 36:03.390
For the slightest thing, people just jump
into a temper.

36:03.390 --> 36:07.220
That means, “I should not be tempted to
do that."

36:07.220 --> 36:12.300
That wisdom, that dignity, that balance, that
poise must come into a Sahaja Yogi.

36:12.300 --> 36:17.080
Unless and until that comes into you who is
going to believe you that you have achieved

36:17.080 --> 36:18.200
anything of this transformation?

36:18.200 --> 36:20.540
You are still on adhogati, sometimes into
urdhvagati.

36:20.540 --> 36:22.120
Then going into adhogati, again to urdhvagati.

36:22.120 --> 36:28.580
You are jumping from one to another.

36:28.580 --> 36:40.260
So now you move on to another higher level,
is from there to [where], what you call, the

36:40.260 --> 36:45.020
‘Mahalakshmi tattwa’ starts; where you
start jumping on to a much higher position

36:45.020 --> 36:47.470
where it is mana.

36:47.470 --> 36:49.290
‘Mana’ is emotions.

36:49.290 --> 36:51.010
Your emotions become compassion.

36:51.010 --> 36:56.380
Now see the difference between emotions and
compassion: is very different.

36:56.380 --> 37:05.570
When the tree hasn’t got flowers it takes,
when it gets the flower, it gives, it gives

37:05.570 --> 37:06.570
the fragrance.

37:06.570 --> 37:10.050
In the same way, when you become the compassion,
you give.

37:10.050 --> 37:17.740
You don’t expect how others treat you, how
others behave towards you, but you think [that]

37:17.740 --> 37:19.840
by giving you will win over the person.

37:19.840 --> 37:22.530
You give.

37:22.530 --> 37:31.270
And that is what you have got: to give compassion
through your vibrations.

37:31.270 --> 37:35.600
But to have that you have to be swadhaa.

37:35.600 --> 37:38.940
Unless and until you have that you cannot
give vibrations either.

37:38.940 --> 37:45.330
So then all these smaller ideas, “It’s
my wife, my husband, my child, my house, my

37:45.330 --> 37:47.440
this, my brother, my sister."

37:47.440 --> 37:51.230
In the beginning everybody comes up with the
whole family list.

37:51.230 --> 37:55.270
They may not have seen their father for ten
years but they’ll come, “My father is

37:55.270 --> 37:56.760
sick, Mother cure him first.

37:56.760 --> 37:58.640
I have not seen him for ten years."

37:58.640 --> 37:59.640
Doesn’t matter!

37:59.640 --> 38:04.530
So every person becomes a liability on Mother
that all the relations, all the great grand

38:04.530 --> 38:13.990
parents and all the great grand children must
be cured by Sahaja Yoga.

38:13.990 --> 38:22.270
But there is no compassion!

38:22.270 --> 39:03.280
And in compassion you do not see these relations.

39:03.280 --> 39:20.700
So, when you become the compassion, before
this you are to be enlightened.

39:20.700 --> 39:24.720
You are to be enlightened, you have no light,
you don’t know how to walk the path, you

39:24.720 --> 39:29.320
don’t know how to go round, you don’t
know how to know others, you don’t know

39:29.320 --> 39:30.320
where you are sitting.

39:30.320 --> 39:36.850
If in a group, you put off the lights everybody
starts hitting each other or trampling over

39:36.850 --> 39:39.160
each other because they don’t know.

39:39.160 --> 39:41.620
But now the lights are on.

39:41.620 --> 39:43.600
So you know how you are related to each other.

39:43.600 --> 39:46.140
You are under the light.

39:46.140 --> 39:47.360
You can see each other.

39:47.360 --> 39:48.870
You can feel each other.

39:48.870 --> 39:50.450
You can understand each other.

39:50.450 --> 39:54.610
That’s how the compassion works.

39:54.610 --> 39:58.250
Compassion works automatically – you don’t
have to do much about it.

39:58.250 --> 40:00.050
But know that you have to be a compassion.

40:00.050 --> 40:09.760
But if you are still are a person wanting
others to love you then it won’t work out.

40:09.760 --> 40:18.000
How much did you love them?

40:18.000 --> 40:21.650
Is your love for another person doubted?

40:21.650 --> 40:24.470
Do you doubt?

40:24.470 --> 40:27.110
Then you are not compassion.

40:27.110 --> 40:31.220
In that love you may even scold the person,
you may even shout at the person.

40:31.220 --> 40:37.530
But the love should be there for the benevolence.

40:37.530 --> 40:41.210
So the compassion should be for the benevolence
of the person.

40:41.210 --> 40:44.350
If you are not benevolent you have not been
compassionate.

40:44.350 --> 40:49.090
Like spoiling somebody, spoiling your child,
spoiling your wife, spoiling your husband.

40:49.090 --> 40:50.990
This is not compassion!

40:50.990 --> 41:01.900
Compassion is a pure ray of beautiful light
of God’s love which gives benevolence to

41:01.900 --> 41:06.090
another person, hita.

41:06.090 --> 41:10.130
So that should happen to you when you talk
of compassion.

41:10.130 --> 41:14.840
You go further with the janah – public.

41:14.840 --> 41:19.520
Those people who cannot carry on with Sahaja
Yogis are absolutely useless people.

41:19.520 --> 41:25.500
These are the cream, these are the best people
in the whole world.

41:25.500 --> 41:28.200
Of course some are like this, doesn’t matter.

41:28.200 --> 41:33.090
But they are the topmost people, they are
the people wedded to such high ideals.

41:33.090 --> 41:36.010
Where do you get anybody with idealism?

41:36.010 --> 41:41.470
You go to the UN, you go anywhere you find
people, they have no idealism of any kind.

41:41.470 --> 41:47.860
It’s only for the job, only for the money,
or this or that, [that] they are working there.

41:47.860 --> 41:50.040
You are the people who have idealism.

41:50.040 --> 41:53.120
You are the people who are striving for something
higher.

41:53.120 --> 41:56.790
You are the people who are going to save the
whole world.

41:56.790 --> 42:01.370
And those who cannot carry on with Sahaja
Yogis and find faults with Sahaja Yogis are

42:01.370 --> 42:03.120
really no good for us.

42:03.120 --> 42:08.240
They should get out of Sahaja Yoga.

42:08.240 --> 42:09.910
What is your public?

42:09.910 --> 42:12.590
First and foremost is Sahaja Yogis.

42:12.590 --> 42:17.550
The rest of them are outsiders so far.

42:17.550 --> 42:21.350
But your attitude should be that you have
to pull them out.

42:21.350 --> 42:22.590
You have to emancipate.

42:22.590 --> 42:23.590
You have to be kind to them.

42:23.590 --> 42:25.360
You have to be compassionate.

42:25.360 --> 42:27.870
And you have to bring them to Sahaja Yoga.

42:27.870 --> 42:30.220
You have to be extremely nice to them.

42:30.220 --> 42:38.170
But more than that you have to be very, very,
extremely nice to Sahaja Yogis.

42:38.170 --> 42:43.300
I can’t understand Sahaja Yogis being nice
to others and not to their own clan or you

42:43.300 --> 42:55.360
can call whatever you may call it – to their
own brothers and sisters.

42:55.360 --> 43:01.870
When I see Sahaja Yogis together loving each
other, being kind to each other and also giving

43:01.870 --> 43:05.460
some good news about each other I feel extremely
happy.

43:05.460 --> 43:11.940
That’s one of the most joyous times for
me.

43:11.940 --> 43:53.770
When I find that you are giving.

43:53.770 --> 44:04.270
So then you come to the point where you are
in the public, you are in the public.

44:04.270 --> 44:05.820
You have to circulate now.

44:05.820 --> 44:07.910
You have to articulate in the public.

44:07.910 --> 44:09.730
You have to move in the public.

44:09.730 --> 44:15.500
You are not only for a secluded group of Sahaja
Yogis, you are not that.

44:15.500 --> 44:20.650
But you have to articulate, you have to circulate.

44:20.650 --> 44:26.090
Now for that, what should we do?

44:26.090 --> 44:37.800
You have to understand that we have to form
other groups, other things by which we can

44:37.800 --> 44:38.800
circulate.

44:38.800 --> 44:40.320
Let’s see now in England we can form some
societies.

44:40.320 --> 44:49.730
Let’s form some society which are not what
we call them as the Sahaja Yogas.

44:49.730 --> 44:51.780
Because you are different from them.

44:51.780 --> 44:53.760
So now let us form some societies.

44:53.760 --> 45:00.590
We form certain societies, say let us form
a society where we talk about the decadence

45:00.590 --> 45:09.090
of this country; how the decadence has come
in, why it is there, why are we spoiling our

45:09.090 --> 45:11.910
young children, why are we behaving like this.

45:11.910 --> 45:12.970
Let us see.

45:12.970 --> 45:16.490
Let us start a society under this name.

45:16.490 --> 45:23.610
Let us start a society which will fight all
social problems.

45:23.610 --> 45:28.760
Like I said in India: let us start a society
which is against dowry system.

45:28.760 --> 45:31.390
That’s how you will circulate with them.

45:31.390 --> 45:35.860
And later on when they come up to a point
they will see your character and then you

45:35.860 --> 45:41.520
can talk to them about Sahaja Yoga.

45:41.520 --> 45:43.800
Like these women have, what is that called?

45:43.800 --> 45:46.020
‘Women’s lib’ and all that.

45:46.020 --> 45:49.270
I mean, it is nonsense, you know that very
well.

45:49.270 --> 45:54.190
But they have formed the society, so they
are there, they are circulating.

45:54.190 --> 45:58.450
We have to have sensible, wise people forming
a society.

45:58.450 --> 46:04.740
So from Sahaja Yoga group we have to move
to society: where you need not talk about

46:04.740 --> 46:07.420
Sahaja Yoga, you need not tell them there
is emancipation.

46:07.420 --> 46:14.270
But let us circulate through them and let
them know about dharma.

46:14.270 --> 46:15.840
Forming no religion as such.

46:15.840 --> 46:18.150
It’s inner religion as we have.

46:18.150 --> 46:21.350
Just without any religion you can start it
off.

46:21.350 --> 46:23.000
So that’s how you meet the public.

46:23.000 --> 46:28.660
There are many such ways, which you can think,
by which you can meet the public.

46:28.660 --> 46:33.380
And then you have to know you are the part
and parcel of your Mother.

46:33.380 --> 46:44.060
There are three things asked from God: that
there is salokya, that, “Oh God, We should

46:44.060 --> 46:46.720
be able to see you,” salokya.

46:46.720 --> 46:51.510
Samipya is, “Oh God, let us have your company."

46:51.510 --> 47:05.830
And third one is, “Oh God let us have a
rapport with you."

47:05.830 --> 47:07.860
Rapport with you.

47:07.860 --> 47:11.020
These are the three things are asked from
God.

47:11.020 --> 47:15.300
But the fourth thing that has happened to
you is tadatmya, means you have become part

47:15.300 --> 47:16.970
and parcel of my body.

47:16.970 --> 47:23.030
As a result of that you have to keep your
body all right, you have to be pure people,

47:23.030 --> 47:27.790
you have to be sensible, otherwise I get into
trouble.

47:27.790 --> 47:35.380
But it’s a very venturesome thing I have
done, doesn’t matter, I don’t mind.

47:35.380 --> 47:38.940
But you people look after yourselves.

47:38.940 --> 47:40.050
You be sensible people.

47:40.050 --> 47:45.030
And when you have funny ideas in your head,
know that these funny ideas can trouble our

47:45.030 --> 47:47.250
Mother very much.

47:47.250 --> 47:53.770
So out of love for me, you have to keep loving
yourself.

47:53.770 --> 47:59.410
And you can love yourself only if you have
pure intelligence to know what is frivolous,

47:59.410 --> 48:07.070
what is nonsensical, whatever is asahaj.

48:07.070 --> 48:09.870
So you move like one body, always support
each other.

48:09.870 --> 48:12.730
If one person is troubled the rest of them
should help.

48:12.730 --> 48:15.930
That’s how the collectivity is going to
work out.

48:15.930 --> 48:25.380
Not to criticise each other, to sit down and
just to show off.

48:25.380 --> 48:34.560
So then you rise even higher to this state
of Jesus Christ, Mahavira and Buddha.

48:34.560 --> 48:37.200
Then what do you have to do?

48:37.200 --> 48:41.130
Is tapaha, is the penance.

48:41.130 --> 48:43.150
You have to do the penance.

48:43.150 --> 48:49.130
Like living in Brahmapuri was a penance, I
thought, but you all enjoyed it bit too much.

48:49.130 --> 48:51.490
Or Ganapatipule, you thought it was too much.

48:51.490 --> 49:05.740
Some people did do some penance by sitting
in the sun! (laughing) But penance means ‘sacrifice’.

49:05.740 --> 49:09.500
Sacrifice.

49:09.500 --> 49:13.330
Without feeling the sacrifice, do the work
as a sacrifice.

49:13.330 --> 49:17.410
You are bound by work.

49:17.410 --> 49:18.570
We have to work.

49:18.570 --> 49:20.260
Human beings have to work.

49:20.260 --> 49:25.660
But the work that is a sacrifice is the most
nourishing thing, is the most joy-giving thing.

49:25.660 --> 49:32.600
And that’s what happened: in Brahmapuri
I must say it was very spartan, both for you

49:32.600 --> 49:38.210
and for your hosts it was quite a funny place
to live in.

49:38.210 --> 49:45.010
And one snake crawled into somebody’s shoes
I am told, but still you all enjoyed it because

49:45.010 --> 49:46.280
you didn’t feel the sacrifice.

49:46.280 --> 49:53.530
It was in a way [a] sacrifice for both the
parties I think: your hosts and the guests.

49:53.530 --> 49:55.610
But you still enjoyed.

49:55.610 --> 49:57.270
And that’s what it is.

49:57.270 --> 50:01.290
Now you will enjoy your sacrifices.

50:01.290 --> 50:04.110
Apart from all other virtues you will enjoy
your sacrifices.

50:04.110 --> 50:09.960
That is one of the quality of the Spirit,
because you are so detached.

50:09.960 --> 50:17.240
You will enjoy it!

50:17.240 --> 50:19.690
So that’s how you come to the state of tapah.

50:19.690 --> 50:25.700
And the last is satya, is the truth.

50:25.700 --> 50:30.450
That is what is in the brain as Shri Krishna
has described, are the roots where you have

50:30.450 --> 50:31.470
to go.

50:31.470 --> 50:34.770
Of course, the doors are open to you.

50:34.770 --> 50:36.690
You must know that you know the truth!

50:36.690 --> 50:39.940
You know the truth, nobody else.

50:39.940 --> 50:50.000
Are you aware of this, that you are the only
few people under this roof who know the truth?

50:50.000 --> 50:52.220
The rest don’t know any truth whatsoever.

50:52.220 --> 50:56.490
So you have to be compassionate to them because
they are blind, they can’t see.

50:56.490 --> 51:00.820
As we are kind to the blind people we have
to be kind to the people who do not know the

51:00.820 --> 51:01.820
truth.

51:01.820 --> 51:02.820
You know the truth!

51:02.820 --> 51:08.130
And the truth is that you are the Spirit.

51:08.130 --> 51:14.200
And then you know, through all miracles, that
you are walking in the Kingdom of Heaven.

51:14.200 --> 51:17.760
That you are blessed by God and that you are
looked after by Him.

51:17.760 --> 51:23.730
So many miracles happen, so many of these,
that suggest that you are really looked after

51:23.730 --> 51:25.800
by God Almighty.

51:25.800 --> 51:28.180
So many beautiful things have happened to
you.

51:28.180 --> 51:32.330
Just think of them one by one from where to
where we have come.

51:32.330 --> 51:39.010
From down below hell rising up one by one,
step by step, now we have come to the brain.

51:39.010 --> 51:46.450
Thanks to our Kundalinis that we have come
up there, that the Mother has brought you

51:46.450 --> 51:47.450
there.

51:47.450 --> 51:51.670
This Kundalini which is your Mother has brought
you there.

51:51.670 --> 51:55.100
Respect Her and respect your Realisation.

51:55.100 --> 52:01.090
Respect each other and know that you are higher
than billions and billions of people of this

52:01.090 --> 52:02.090
earth.

52:02.090 --> 52:10.040
You are special people and as that you have
to behave in the most humble, respectable

52:10.040 --> 52:11.860
and a loving manner.

52:11.860 --> 52:15.080
I say love is the highest.

52:15.080 --> 52:25.060
Everyone who has developed a language of love
is working out God’s wish because God’s

52:25.060 --> 52:34.760
wish, His desire, His iccha, that Shakti,
is the power of love.

52:34.760 --> 52:38.730
We work out everything with hatred: what’s
wrong with that person, what’s wrong with

52:38.730 --> 52:42.740
that house, what’s wrong with this association,
with that.

52:42.740 --> 52:43.880
That is all hatred.

52:43.880 --> 52:49.560
But let’s see what’s good with that, what’s
nice, what’s joyful.

52:49.560 --> 52:55.080
When your eyes turn that way, when your attitudes
turn like that, then you must know that you

52:55.080 --> 52:59.110
are Sahaj Yogis.

52:59.110 --> 53:09.360
For that Christ has given us a big weapon
called forgive, forgive, forgive.

53:09.360 --> 53:10.610
And the truth has dawned upon you.

53:10.610 --> 53:12.030
You know the truth.

53:12.030 --> 53:15.470
Through your vibrations you know, through
your vibratory awareness you know.

53:15.470 --> 53:21.260
But, there is a very big ‘but’ for which
I have to tell you again and again and I am

53:21.260 --> 53:24.840
telling you again today which is the most
important thing for a Sahaj Yogi – is to

53:24.840 --> 53:27.110
use your vibratory awareness.

53:27.110 --> 53:28.920
They don’t!

53:28.920 --> 53:31.930
They just don’t use their vibratory awareness.

53:31.930 --> 53:34.850
In judging others they never use their vibratory
awareness.

53:34.850 --> 53:37.010
Then how do we say they are special people?

53:37.010 --> 53:39.780
Because you have the same eyes, you have nose.

53:39.780 --> 53:42.850
What about your vibratory awareness?

53:42.850 --> 53:45.840
Did you see the vibrations when you did something?

53:45.840 --> 53:47.240
You did not!

53:47.240 --> 53:49.090
That’s why the mistakes.

53:49.090 --> 53:55.750
Because these vibrations come as an indication
from something that is your Spirit, which

53:55.750 --> 54:00.940
is an absolute thing, which is in absolute
state – it is not relative.

54:00.940 --> 54:01.940
It’s absolute.

54:01.940 --> 54:05.510
So whatever information it gives you is absolute.

54:05.510 --> 54:07.820
And you should take to that absolute understanding.

54:07.820 --> 54:12.130
This is where we miss.

54:12.130 --> 54:18.510
So today just before Shiva Puja, Shiva Puja
is the puja of the Spirit within you.

54:18.510 --> 54:23.850
It’s the Spirit within you.

54:23.850 --> 54:30.800
And for this puja specially you have to determine
that now we will use our vibratory awareness

54:30.800 --> 54:32.070
to judge something.

54:32.070 --> 54:34.410
“I think…” is not there.

54:34.410 --> 54:41.670
“I think…” is a wrong idea.

54:41.670 --> 54:44.920
I know through vibratory awareness.

54:44.920 --> 54:50.220
We have to develop a word for this, which
we say, “I feel…” it could be something

54:50.220 --> 54:52.590
nonsensical.

54:52.590 --> 55:03.540
But you really, as they say in Marathi there’s
a word, ‘zanee’: is a feeling.

55:03.540 --> 55:06.130
But it’s a new awareness.

55:06.130 --> 55:10.760
Through this awareness, this Divine awareness,
through that, you have to judge everything,

55:10.760 --> 55:13.650
to know everything, and to do everything through
that.

55:13.650 --> 55:19.200
This is what we have to use.

55:19.200 --> 55:27.260
And when we start doing that then you will
know that God is working out everything for

55:27.260 --> 55:28.260
us.

55:28.260 --> 55:30.510
It’s so simple.

55:30.510 --> 55:31.730
Life becomes much simpler.

55:31.730 --> 55:38.010
All your complications, all your angers, all
your troubles, all will vanish as soon as

55:38.010 --> 55:44.590
you start using this, because it is such an
universal thing and such a benevolent blessing.

55:44.590 --> 55:49.280
It just makes you wonderful.

55:49.280 --> 56:00.100
You become a wonderful personality: happy
joyous, straight-forward, open-hearted, fearless.

56:00.100 --> 56:02.600
Absolutely enchanting.

56:02.600 --> 56:07.910
May God bless you all.

56:07.910 --> 56:13.250
You want to have any questions?

56:13.250 --> 56:27.380
This lecture has been rather complicated I
think, in a way, so it’s better to repeat

56:27.380 --> 56:28.940
it or them, sometimes, again.

56:28.940 --> 56:35.280
Maybe at Shiv puja would be a good idea.

56:35.280 --> 56:36.830
Any question please?

56:36.830 --> 56:45.400
New Lady: How can you forgive a person like
Hitler?

56:45.400 --> 56:48.060
Shri Mataji: Actually, you see, you don’t
do anything.

56:48.060 --> 56:50.580
When you forgive or not forgive, you really
don’t do anything.

56:50.580 --> 56:51.580
It’s a myth.

56:51.580 --> 56:52.580
It’s just a myth.

56:52.580 --> 56:53.580
“I don’t forgive."

56:53.580 --> 56:54.580
Means what do you do?

56:54.580 --> 56:55.580
It’s a myth.

56:55.580 --> 57:09.950
New Lady: It’s how you feel towards a person
who has committed so many crimes and the detention

57:09.950 --> 57:11.330
of Jews.

57:11.330 --> 57:15.430
Shri Mataji: But what about Jewish now?

57:15.430 --> 57:19.180
If they had forgiven Hitler, God would have
looked after him!

57:19.180 --> 57:20.310
God is looking after him.

57:20.310 --> 57:24.550
But when the Jews didn’t forgive him, they
have become more like Hitler, sometimes.

57:24.550 --> 57:27.410
They behave like Hitler sometimes I feel.

57:27.410 --> 57:30.780
The way they are treating PLO people is something
horrible.

57:30.780 --> 57:36.770
You see, so if you do not forgive you become
like the person you are hating.

57:36.770 --> 57:38.810
If you forgive you don’t become like that.

57:38.810 --> 57:40.840
Just that person goes out of your mind completely.

57:40.840 --> 57:43.510
I mean, they have imbibed certain qualities
now.

57:43.510 --> 57:46.490
I can’t imagine Jews behaving like this!

57:46.490 --> 57:49.400
They are behaving in a very funny manner.

57:49.400 --> 57:50.920
You can see it clearly!

57:50.920 --> 57:58.810
I mean, they had no place to go, they had
no land to live, they were given a land.

57:58.810 --> 58:02.560
And now the way they are troubling PLOs, I
was amazed.

58:02.560 --> 58:06.710
Because I met some of the students of this
PLO people who came to India, who have been

58:06.710 --> 58:07.960
given asylum.

58:07.960 --> 58:13.480
And when I heard how Jews tortured them – just
like Hitler, just like Hitler.

58:13.480 --> 58:16.340
I wish they had forgiven.

58:16.340 --> 58:21.430
I mean, if they had not forgiven Hitler, what
did they do out of it?

58:21.430 --> 58:22.430
Nothing!

58:22.430 --> 58:24.010
Hitler is punished by God, not by you.

58:24.010 --> 58:26.530
What can you punish him?

58:26.530 --> 58:29.980
You cannot punish him.

58:29.980 --> 58:32.850
Alright?

58:32.850 --> 58:36.530
When we forgive, we don’t imbibe that cruelty
within ourselves.

58:36.530 --> 58:38.470
That’s the biggest thing that happens.

58:38.470 --> 58:44.700
Apart from that we do not suffer when we forgive.

58:44.700 --> 58:54.540
I mean, if you go on thinking about it, what
people did say, imagine, think of the people

58:54.540 --> 58:55.540
when Mr.

58:55.540 --> 58:59.310
Columbus reached America, who followed them
[and] what they did there!

58:59.310 --> 59:00.390
Horrible things.

59:00.390 --> 59:03.060
I mean, worse than Hitler.

59:03.060 --> 59:07.490
They wiped out each and every person from
there.

59:07.490 --> 59:12.500
Then when they tried to consume other countries,
going to other countries and ruling them.

59:12.500 --> 59:16.230
If you go to China you will be shocked, even
about English, what they have to say.

59:16.230 --> 59:18.280
Even in India, if you go, you will find.

59:18.280 --> 59:23.460
How can anybody forgive them if you think
what they have done?

59:23.460 --> 59:28.500
But that is finished now and gone, forever!

59:28.500 --> 59:31.840
You are not to think about it at all.

59:31.840 --> 59:32.890
It’s finished.

59:32.890 --> 59:36.020
Today, what is the situation, we have to see.

59:36.020 --> 59:42.680
You will be amazed, if I tell you, that myself,
I was tortured by English very much.

59:42.680 --> 59:43.680
So what?

59:43.680 --> 59:45.210
For me you are my children.

59:45.210 --> 59:47.760
I don’t think of that at all because that’s
finished.

59:47.760 --> 59:50.070
They were bhootish people, that’s all – finished.

59:50.070 --> 59:51.070
Where are they?

59:51.070 --> 59:52.380
Where is Hitler today?

59:52.380 --> 59:54.710
Where are those people who died?

59:54.710 --> 59:55.710
Finished!

59:55.710 --> 01:00:00.800
Better to forgive so that God punishes them
well.

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:07.040
Now, today, is not the time of punishing anyone,
it’s the time of evolving, of helping people

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.440
to rise above that.

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:12.590
So there is no more danger of getting any
Hitlers on this Earth.

01:00:12.590 --> 01:00:14.530
We have to create such a beautiful garden!

01:00:14.530 --> 01:00:17.360
Why to think of the thorns?

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:20.990
Forget about all that nonsense, you see!

01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:27.600
These are special blossom times: let us think
of the flowers and not of the past and the

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.670
thorns that we had finished off.

01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:34.710
We have to give something very beautiful to
our children.

01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:35.770
Isn’t it?

01:00:35.770 --> 01:00:38.820
A heritage where people will say, “Oh, I
see.

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:46.540
There were people who forgave all such things
and created a beautiful world for us!”

01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:52.990
Isn’t it a nice thought?

01:00:52.990 --> 01:00:56.340
Better than not forgiving.

01:00:56.340 --> 01:01:02.390
Like that we go on thinking about, “He did
this and he did that."

01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:03.910
There’s no end to it!

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:05.170
God looks after!

01:01:05.170 --> 01:01:06.170
He’ll punish.

01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:07.840
He’s punished him so badly.

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:09.850
Now nobody wants to take Hitler’s name!

01:01:09.850 --> 01:01:15.310
I mean, if somebody sees Hitler’s photograph
somewhere he will go and have a bath in India.

01:01:15.310 --> 01:01:19.270
He’ll just go to the river Ganges and have
a bath, “Oh God!

01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:25.310
How did I see Hitler’s face anywhere?”

01:01:25.310 --> 01:01:33.020
What more you want as a punishment for Hitler
that they can ’t even face his photograph?

01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:37.810
And some person who looks like Hitler, they’ll
say, “You just shave off your moustache

01:01:37.810 --> 01:01:39.640
at least!

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:43.280
Don’t look like that.

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:46.010
It’s very inauspicious!”

01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:50.860
Yes, I know somebody who looked like Hitler
and they said, “You shave off your moustache

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:55.090
and comb your hair from the other side, or
make it a parting in the centre.

01:01:55.090 --> 01:02:01.840
We can’t see you like this early in the
morning!”

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:02.840
Imagine!

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:08.590
What an inauspicious face! (laughter) He’s
hated by anyone.

01:02:08.590 --> 01:02:10.450
You go to any place.

01:02:10.450 --> 01:02:12.040
Even in Germany they hate him.

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:19.940
So what’s the use of such a character being
so much dominant on our heads?

01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:22.040
Have nothing to do with it.

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:26.300
Because once you start thinking about him
you also develop certain habits that he had.

01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:31.980
A little cruelty comes up when you become
angry and when you cannot forgive others,

01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:34.760
you also think it’s right that you can punish
others.

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:38.270
Here we are not fighting the sword with a
sword but with a shield.

01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:42.490
We are fighting the sword with a shield.

01:02:42.490 --> 01:02:50.760
We never fight sword with a sword, we fight
it with a shield.

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:58.170
That’s a wise attitude towards life, I think.

01:02:58.170 --> 01:03:00.110
Otherwise you will create more Hitlers.

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:03.260
One Hitler is dead and now ten Hitlers have
come out – already have come out!

01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:13.590
They are all to be finished now, once [and]
for all.

01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:38.250
You can help by creating a new pattern, a
new world of beauty.

01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:39.260
Any other question please?

01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:43.860
That’s a nice question, I know it happens
to her.

01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:48.240
But now you are feeling better inside aren’t
you?

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:50.050
(laughing) Much more!

01:03:50.050 --> 01:03:52.850
That’s how we have to bring peace on this
Earth.

01:03:52.850 --> 01:03:59.290
How are we going to bring peace if there’s
still lurking anger?

01:03:59.290 --> 01:04:02.570
Not forgiving means anger!

01:04:02.570 --> 01:04:07.550
That’s all.

01:04:07.550 --> 01:04:10.040
Hmmm.

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:15.020
What else?

01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:18.750
Ask some questions at least!

01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:20.860
Must ask some questions.

01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:23.210
Yes, what’s that doctor?

01:04:23.210 --> 01:04:24.250
Dr.

01:04:24.250 --> 01:04:39.930
Brian Wells: Shri Mataji, sometimes in my
work I find myself getting very angry with

01:04:39.930 --> 01:04:47.310
the people I work with is this ever appropriate
or should one always try and love and forgive

01:04:47.310 --> 01:04:48.310
them and be gentle.

01:04:48.310 --> 01:04:49.310
Shri Mataji: Yes, better try that! (laughter)
As far as possible!

01:04:49.310 --> 01:04:50.310
But sometimes anger can also help.

01:04:50.310 --> 01:04:54.200
But I think, just now, for us, we are developing
now, it’s better to take to the more gentler

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:57.560
ways and things like that and not to get angry
– for the time being.

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:59.880
But we’ll have to show anger sometimes.

01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:02.660
Let God show the anger.

01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:05.450
Let him take the credit.

01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:10.840
You will be more effective if you are gentle,
I tell you.

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:19.450
By anger you cannot correct people, you cannot
make them more efficient; but by love.

01:05:19.450 --> 01:05:23.580
Those days are gone where anger and hot-temper
used to impress people.

01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:28.020
Nowadays these people don’t like such people.

01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:32.170
Anger or some people are also very silly.

01:05:32.170 --> 01:05:36.890
They think [that] by being silly they’ll
impress others: like clowns or something.

01:05:36.890 --> 01:05:37.930
It’s not so.

01:05:37.930 --> 01:05:44.790
Now we are different people in this world
and they just know that this is a silly person,

01:05:44.790 --> 01:05:46.460
that’s all.

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:52.820
They expect a leader or anybody who has to
give something to others has to be something

01:05:52.820 --> 01:06:02.910
of a higher and a better personality – it’s
expected.

01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:13.740
Cheapish things or anything that is publicly
people may like you to do, it a leader does

01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:18.690
that they don’t like it, they don’t like
it.

01:06:18.690 --> 01:06:25.100
A leader is supposed to be something above,
above the normal.

01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:29.670
But the idea of leadership these days is alright:
everybody is doing the ‘shake’ so the

01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:30.770
leader is doing the shake.

01:06:30.770 --> 01:06:36.850
Then everybody wears a tight jean [so] the
leader also wears the tight jean and he can’t

01:06:36.850 --> 01:06:38.550
sit on his chair!

01:06:38.550 --> 01:06:40.390
So that’s not the way.

01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:43.700
That’s not the way you can be leaders.

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:47.540
A leader has to make a pattern of his own.

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:51.710
And he doesn’t have to solve the problems
of the people but give them the problem to

01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:52.710
be solved.

01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:54.280
That’s how leadership works out.

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:59.810
So for anybody who wants to get anything done,
must learn that the pattern should be of such

01:06:59.810 --> 01:07:09.270
a level that others should not take advantage,
should not think that they can bring you to

01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:10.270
your level.

01:07:10.270 --> 01:07:15.360
For example, I’ll tell you: in India there’s
a habit of eating tobacco, dried tobacco.

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:21.860
Now, those people who eat tobacco, say there’s
a high court judge – he’ll call his peon

01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:30.860
and ask him “Have you go the…”, they
call it ‘dubbi’ means a small little pouch,

01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:36.090
so, “Have you got the dubbi?”

01:07:36.090 --> 01:07:39.050
So, the whole dignity is finished!

01:07:39.050 --> 01:07:41.360
Whole dignity is finished!

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:46.300
That, just an ordinary peon can say, “Do
you want your dubbi?”

01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:48.720
So then it’s done.

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:54.600
What about his great position and dress and
everything?

01:07:54.600 --> 01:08:02.140
He makes a big gown and wears [and] on the
head they wear a kind of a wig.

01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:14.010
And all that is useless because you are asking
for a dubbi from a peon!

01:08:14.010 --> 01:08:22.860
So what impresses people is dignity, balance,
poise, humility and truthfulness – straightforward

01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:27.790
truthfulness – even in day to day work.

01:08:27.790 --> 01:08:34.330
Of course efficiency comes like that.

01:08:34.330 --> 01:08:39.070
Peacemaking.

01:08:39.070 --> 01:08:41.770
You must make peace between two persons, ten
persons.

01:08:41.770 --> 01:08:46.410
Try to make peace instead of supporting one
person or taking sides.

01:08:46.410 --> 01:08:48.330
Best is to make peace.

01:08:48.330 --> 01:08:59.100
But if somebody is doing absolutely wrong,
then you have to take another attitude.

01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:00.720
Any other question?

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.130
Yes?

01:09:02.130 --> 01:09:04.950
Yogini: (unclear)

01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:11.990
Shri Mataji: What’s she saying?

01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:22.830
Yogi: She’s asking you to tell us how we
settle down in Sahaja Yoga.

01:09:22.830 --> 01:09:23.830
For the new people.

01:09:23.830 --> 01:09:24.830
Shri Mataji: Settle down in Sahaja Yoga?

01:09:24.830 --> 01:09:25.830
You are already settled!

01:09:25.830 --> 01:09:38.070
Gavin Brown: Some of the new people have come
quite new to Sahaja Yoga, they haven’t met

01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:39.070
you before Mother.

01:09:39.070 --> 01:09:46.460
Shri Mataji: You see, I was born so settled
down I don’t know! (laughter) First of all,

01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:53.260
in Sahaja Yoga, one has to realise that you
have got vibrations.

01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:55.500
Now, put it on that.

01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.230
I think that’s the best criteria.

01:09:57.230 --> 01:10:01.290
“Am I getting my vibrations alright?

01:10:01.290 --> 01:10:02.560
Are they flowing alright?

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:04.830
If not, what’s wrong with me?”

01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:07.580
Direct your attention to yourself to find
out.

01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:10.880
“Is there anything wrong with me that I
cannot get my vibrations alright?

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:11.880
Alright!

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:13.540
There must be something wrong.

01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:14.800
Now what is that wrong?”

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:16.220
Try to correct it.

01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:20.070
First of all they must direct their attention
to themselves then they will start settling

01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:21.070
down.

01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:25.000
But all the time, supposing, I have seen many
people who come to Sahaja Yoga: out of them

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.490
some say, “I saw one Sahaja Yogi who was
like this!”

01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:32.420
They see to others: how they are are, how
they are, how they are.

01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:37.520
You should see to yourself because this is
for your benevolence, for your betterment.

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:41.560
So the first attitude should be, “What have
I gained?

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:43.800
What have I to gain?

01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:47.190
How am I to get better?”

01:10:47.190 --> 01:10:53.010
Or else there could be some people who think
that, “I must get better.

01:10:53.010 --> 01:10:54.180
My health should be alright.

01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:59.670
I didn’t get kshema, benevolence, as was
promised by Sahaja Yogis!”

01:10:59.670 --> 01:11:03.140
No, something wrong with you: still the yoga
is not established.

01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:04.770
First establish your yoga.

01:11:04.770 --> 01:11:10.340
If you have not established your yoga how
can you get what you want?

01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:13.180
So, first of all it’s such a genuine effort.

01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:17.240
One has to be absolutely genuinely asking
for that yoga.

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:19.350
And you cannot force people.

01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:21.440
You cannot force it.

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:22.440
Whatever lecture you may give.

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:27.040
You may like my lectures or anything, they
might sound very good but it doesn’t matter.

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:29.570
It must go into your being.

01:11:29.570 --> 01:11:31.660
It must work out in your being.

01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:33.110
You have to become something.

01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:35.360
You should certify yourself that, “Yes,
yes.

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:38.080
I am like that."

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:40.090
We may be very few – doesn’t matter.

01:11:40.090 --> 01:11:41.090
It’s meant for the few.

01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:47.610
It cannot be given to every funny type of
a person or a person who is just forced into

01:11:47.610 --> 01:11:48.610
Sahaja Yoga.

01:11:48.610 --> 01:11:49.610
You cannot force it.

01:11:49.610 --> 01:11:55.570
It’s not like winning over election, you
see, that you make somebody a communist and

01:11:55.570 --> 01:11:57.290
overnight he becomes a capitalist.

01:11:57.290 --> 01:11:59.720
It’s not like that.

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:01.430
It’s the inner growth.

01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:08.680
And only those who are deserving, who have
that value of their own existence – only

01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.380
such people can come.

01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:13.130
So you cannot force on them at all!

01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:14.590
They have to see to it.

01:12:14.590 --> 01:12:18.580
And what they have to see in other people
[is] that what are they doing that they are

01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:19.990
so much settled.

01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:24.390
And there should be an understanding that
we have just now entered into the university,

01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:28.140
say for example: a new class we are in.

01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:30.860
Now how are we to go higher and higher?

01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:33.190
Their attitude has to be that way.

01:12:33.190 --> 01:12:35.070
You cannot force things into them.

01:12:35.070 --> 01:12:39.490
It’s like I always say [that] I have cooked
for you, the food is ready.

01:12:39.490 --> 01:12:41.160
If you are hungry you will eat it.

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:43.890
I cannot force the food into your mouth!

01:12:43.890 --> 01:12:45.630
You have to taste it yourself and enjoy.

01:12:45.630 --> 01:12:51.930
But there’s a gap, gap between when they
get Realisation and when they feel joy because

01:12:51.930 --> 01:12:56.430
specially in the West they have no idea as
to what Realisation is, they have never known

01:12:56.430 --> 01:12:57.430
the Kundalini.

01:12:57.430 --> 01:13:02.650
It’s a new language to them, everything
is new, so they have to be given little assistance

01:13:02.650 --> 01:13:06.480
and help to tell them that, “No, there is
joy!

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:07.480
You have to go beyond.

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:10.060
You have to see [that] these things exist.

01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:11.640
Whatever the saints have said is true.

01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:15.570
Whatever the scriptures have described is
true and you can find out.

01:13:15.570 --> 01:13:17.780
But you have to have patience with yourself."

01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:21.950
But if they want to criticise and they want
to say, “Oh, how can that be?

01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:22.950
And how can that be?”

01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:25.850
Such people will take too much time!

01:13:25.850 --> 01:13:28.250
But there must be some genuine seekers.

01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:33.920
And there are some slow movers also so accordingly
they move and you cannot force them.

01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:40.110
At the most you can support them for a while
but then again they drop down.

01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:41.110
You have seen that.

01:13:41.110 --> 01:13:46.030
It’s happening every time in the West specially,
not in India.

01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:47.030
Not in India.

01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:48.180
Not that, also, in [Indian] villages – it
doesn’t happen.

01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:51.710
Once you get six thousand you get six thousand
– finished!

01:13:51.710 --> 01:13:53.090
I have known least of them.

01:13:53.090 --> 01:13:55.550
I don’t know who they are [but] they are
there.

01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:59.800
You meet them somewhere and they’ll just
come and fall at my feet and say, “Mother

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:01.350
I am a Sahaja Yogi."

01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:04.560
I said, “I know that.

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:05.560
I know you are.

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:10.560
You are my children I know just from your
presence I know you are my children."

01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:13.380
So they have to become that.

01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:14.400
You cannot force.

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:16.460
That’s one thing we do not realise.

01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:26.140
You see, now, in the churches they are compromising,
“Let’s have a disco dance!

01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:34.280
And in the disco dance when the people will
come then we will have some Christians there."

01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:35.280
Imagine!

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:40.660
People who are going to disco dance how can
they be Christians?

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:45.890
And this kind of a compromise is there because
it’s a money-oriented stuff.

01:14:45.890 --> 01:14:47.790
It is not God-oriented, it’s money-oriented.

01:14:47.790 --> 01:14:51.830
So, “We must have more people so that we
have more money so we can have more clergies,

01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:52.940
we can give more pay."

01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:55.350
It’s all on that level [that] it works.

01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:57.180
But not in Sahaja Yoga.

01:14:57.180 --> 01:15:03.200
In Sahaja Yoga everyone is a temple of God,
everyone is a church of God and everyone has

01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:04.590
to come up to that.

01:15:04.590 --> 01:15:09.430
And those who do not have that respect of
oneself, we cannot force.

01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:11.950
How can you say, “You must have respect
for yourself!”

01:15:11.950 --> 01:15:13.360
Can you say like that?

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:16.800
I mean, it’s something not possible.

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:19.830
That’s what you all people should know.

01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:22.760
Also we should reconcile to that.

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:25.170
I have done my level best.

01:15:25.170 --> 01:15:30.460
Except for standing on my head I have done
everything that is possible but what I find

01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:32.350
is that it’s very difficult.

01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:33.350
Too much of ego!

01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:34.350
Too much.

01:15:34.350 --> 01:15:38.090
Too much of ego in the West – absolutely
– and they are so ignorant.

01:15:38.090 --> 01:15:41.010
They have never heard the name of Kundalini,
can you imagine?

01:15:41.010 --> 01:15:43.140
What tremendous ignorance there is.

01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:48.850
But those who are wise, those who have pure
intelligence, came to Sahaja Yoga, they learnt

01:15:48.850 --> 01:15:50.400
everything, they know so much.

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:57.350
And some of the Sahaja Yogis in the West know
more than Indians know, I know.

01:15:57.350 --> 01:16:01.890
We can say that there are many good Indian
Sahaja Yogis but there are some excellent

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:04.060
ones in the West.

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:09.990
Par excellence, I should say, some of them
are.

01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:13.060
So that’s it.

01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:14.060
So why worry?

01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:21.560
We have the quality, if not the quantity.

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:25.860
But this quality only is going to attract
these ego people.

01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:28.260
That’s only going to attract them, nothing
else.

01:16:28.260 --> 01:16:32.810
This quality of your personality, of your
temperament, of your behaviour, everything

01:16:32.810 --> 01:16:34.210
is going to attract them.

01:16:34.210 --> 01:16:41.560
But supposing tomorrow you say, “Alright,
I’ll make a holey jeans,” and walk about

01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:52.490
with the holes in the jeans and then people
will say, “What a nice Sahaja Yogi he is!”

01:16:52.490 --> 01:16:56.000
It’s not the way!

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.970
You must have your own personality, you must
have your own dignity.

01:16:58.970 --> 01:17:01.130
You shouldn’t behave like them.

01:17:01.130 --> 01:17:03.230
But you should not condemn them either.

01:17:03.230 --> 01:17:04.250
Know that they are ignorant.

01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:05.250
They have no idea.

01:17:05.250 --> 01:17:08.140
They don’t have the knowledge of the roots
at all.

01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:17.730
You have the knowledge, so you have to be
kind like a teacher is kind to his students.

01:17:17.730 --> 01:17:21.760
I never expected that in the West I’ll be
able to talk to so many people myself.

01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:29.110
I mean, in the beginning when I came here
they used to say, “This Victorian old woman!”

01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:30.980
And all kinds of things they branded me with.

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:31.980
So it’s alright.

01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:32.980
I didn’t mind that time.

01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:34.500
Now they are alright.

01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:38.310
That’s how they are, what can you do?

01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:42.150
To begin with they brand you, they do this
and do that.

01:17:42.150 --> 01:17:43.150
Hmm.

01:17:43.150 --> 01:17:46.580
Any other question?

01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:53.400
But the society you can form and get to people
who believe in a proper life, a healthy life

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:55.480
and healthy society.

01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:59.780
You can start a society like that, saying
that, “We want to belong to the healthy

01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:00.780
society."

01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:02.460
You can take your children to that kind of
a thing.

01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:05.950
You can get other children: where there are
no drugs and things like that.

01:18:05.950 --> 01:18:07.790
You can start on that level.

01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:12.820
Maybe from there you might get some people.

01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:20.210
Anything else?

01:18:20.210 --> 01:18:38.900
Gavin Brown: Shri Mataji, whenever you speak
the questions go away!

01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:41.350
Shri Mataji: You jump into thoughtless awareness,
I know that.

01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:50.710
Gavin Brown: There’s one thing we’d like
to ask you is to accept your birthday present

01:18:50.710 --> 01:18:51.710
a little early.

01:18:51.710 --> 01:18:52.710
Shri Mataji: A birthday present?

01:18:52.710 --> 01:19:01.020
I mean if you have so many birthdays I’ll
become older very fast! (laughter)

01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:03.680
Oh, Gavin.

01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:06.350
So sweet!

01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:13.000
Gavin Brown: Something very little.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:18.610
Shri Mataji: You always say so!

01:19:18.610 --> 01:19:22.160
Thank you very much.

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:23.930
Thank you.

01:19:23.930 --> 01:19:36.360
(applause) You better open and show them,
I don’t know what it is like.

01:19:36.360 --> 01:20:09.180
They’ll be very happy to see that.

01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:13.460
Those who have got Left Vishuddhi, I would
suggest you sit down with your left hand towards

01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:17.390
me and one hand on the Mother Earth – will
solve the problem immediately.

01:20:17.390 --> 01:20:20.970
Just have it.

01:20:20.970 --> 01:20:23.360
Left Vishuddhi.

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:25.240
Call your mother here.

01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:38.850
Let her have a candle.

01:20:38.850 --> 01:20:46.030
Left hand towards me and right hand [on Mother
Earth].

01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:51.480
What’s it Gavin?

01:20:51.480 --> 01:21:00.570
It’s quite a big thing.

01:21:00.570 --> 01:21:07.840
It’s so many pieces.

01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:14.760
I hope not you have spent so much money.

01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:27.950
You can say the mantra in your heart, “Mother
I am not guilty."

01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:39.290
First [for] your mother, just give her this
candle.

01:21:39.290 --> 01:21:40.360
What’s that?

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:41.430
Oh Gavin!

01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:43.030
Beautiful isn’t it?

01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:44.030
And a dolphin there!

01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:45.030
Just imagine!

01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:48.350
Thank you very much it’s beautiful.

01:21:48.350 --> 01:21:50.750
It’s beautiful.

01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:55.550
It’s very, very beautiful.

01:21:55.550 --> 01:21:56.750
Beautiful.

01:21:56.750 --> 01:22:01.550
Thank you very much.

01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:02.750
Haa!

01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:07.550
Gavin Brown: It’s French.

01:22:07.550 --> 01:22:12.350
Shri Mataji: It’s French?

01:22:12.350 --> 01:22:15.390
Why not get something English from English?

01:22:15.390 --> 01:22:16.390
Alright.

01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:18.130
It’s alright.

01:22:18.130 --> 01:22:21.780
For me it’s alright.

01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:22.780
Aha.

01:22:22.780 --> 01:22:32.080
Working out!

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:41.460
Better?

01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:46.210
Cancer patients should be treated with this,
those who have got cancer or anything left-sided,

01:22:46.210 --> 01:22:48.410
psychosomatic.

01:22:48.410 --> 01:22:52.440
The other day, doctor – you will be amazed
– there was a lady who came, she had cancer

01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:57.870
of the glands and she had tied up her head
with a scarf, in Madras.

01:22:57.870 --> 01:23:02.160
So while talking I told her, “You take a
candle and sit there with your left hand towards

01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:05.960
me and right hand outside."

01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:08.280
And after ten minutes I said, “Alright,
remove your scarf."

01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:14.370
The whole thing was cured.

01:23:14.370 --> 01:23:17.290
It’s tremendous.

01:23:17.290 --> 01:23:25.820
And they have now started that PhD thing in
India.

01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:31.930
Better?

01:23:31.930 --> 01:23:44.140
Much better.

01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:56.120
It’s working out.

01:23:56.120 --> 01:24:01.730
Good.

01:24:01.730 --> 01:24:19.390
(Shri Mataji talks to some children)

01:24:19.390 --> 01:24:29.150
Akshay, you didn’t give me a kiss!

01:24:29.150 --> 01:24:42.210
You must give me a kiss too!

01:24:42.210 --> 01:24:49.100
Alright give it to Olympia then!

01:24:49.100 --> 01:24:50.400
Feeling shy!

01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:53.550
So I think I’ll take your leave Gavin.

01:24:53.550 --> 01:24:54.650
Is it alright?

01:24:54.650 --> 01:25:28.330
So tomorrow I don’t think you can come early
in the morning, it’s too early – to the

01:25:28.330 --> 01:25:33.220
airport.

01:25:33.220 --> 01:25:58.620
And I’ll be leaving about seven o’clock
from the house, at seven thirty-five I’ll

01:25:58.620 --> 01:25:59.630
be there.

01:25:59.630 --> 01:26:01.040
Are you alright now?

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:02.040
Good?

01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:03.040
So where’s the baby?

01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:04.040
Where’s Wendy’s baby?

01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:05.530
Rodrigo Sanchez-Castro: It’s in Southampton
Mother.

01:26:05.530 --> 01:26:07.120
Shri Mataji: Oh I see.

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:11.520
So you want to have the name?

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:16.430
When was she born?

01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:28.140
Rodrigo Sanchez-Castro: She was born on the
thirteen of February.

01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:33.310
Shri Mataji: So call her ‘Himakanya’.

01:26:33.310 --> 01:26:42.330
Himakanya is the name of the Goddess born
when…’Hima’ means ‘the snow’.

01:26:42.330 --> 01:27:01.930
That’s the time she was born, when it was
snowing.

01:27:01.930 --> 01:27:12.790
Rodrigo Sanchez-Castro: It’s a boy Mother.

01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:15.780
Shri Mataji: No.

01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:17.780
Then ‘Himanshu’.

01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:20.770
‘Himanshu’ is alright.

01:27:20.770 --> 01:27:23.770
It’s a boy.

01:27:23.770 --> 01:27:27.170
I thought it’s a girl they said.

01:27:27.170 --> 01:27:29.430
Rodrigo Sanchez-Castro: No, no.

01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:31.690
It’s a boy Mother.

01:27:31.690 --> 01:27:34.520
Shri Mataji: Alright, so ‘Himanshu’.

01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:35.650
It’s good.

01:27:35.650 --> 01:27:37.660
‘Himanshu’ is a good name.

01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:47.890
‘Himanshu’ means ‘the one who is born
out of the..’ ‘anshu’ means ‘the essence’

01:27:47.890 --> 01:27:50.030
‘Hima’ means ‘the ice’.

01:27:50.030 --> 01:27:51.940
He’s the essence of the ice.

01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:52.940
‘Himanshu’.

01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:54.650
Is the name of Shiva.

01:27:54.650 --> 01:28:02.400

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:10.940
This is a new one?

01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:18.730
New Sahaja Yogini?

01:28:18.730 --> 01:28:21.330
Aaah.

01:28:21.330 --> 01:28:26.530
That’s Leela.

01:28:26.530 --> 01:28:31.060
You want some chana?

01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:38.230
Leela’s sister: She likes that.

01:28:38.230 --> 01:28:52.750
Shri Mataji: Do

01:28:52.750 --> 01:28:54.350
you like that?

01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:58.980
Alright, I’ll give her some chana.

01:28:58.980 --> 01:29:10.480

the others there.

01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:11.500
Alright.

01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:16.610
So you carry some more.

01:29:16.610 --> 01:29:18.210

01:29:18.210 --> 01:29:20.520
Come along, have some more.

01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:21.740
You have big, big hands now.

01:29:21.740 --> 01:31:10.220
You’ve become a big girl I must say!
