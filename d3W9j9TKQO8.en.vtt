00:07.711 --> 00:11.351
But if your attention goes higher

00:11.471 --> 00:16.111
– say [as] my attention is. I am only nothing but charity! I mean what am I?

00:16.231 --> 00:23.231
It just flows. You just become the charity.

00:24.551 --> 00:26.424
So the difference between

00:26.545 --> 00:30.351
a person who is a realised and a not realised is this

00:30.471 --> 00:38.751
that the attention which was giving myth as reality to you

00:38.871 --> 00:41.351
is gone now, is gone higher.

00:41.471 --> 00:44.151
It can see that it is myth.

00:44.271 --> 00:47.791
Attention can clearly see that it is myth,

00:47.911 --> 00:53.871
and you can see that yourself and you can remove yourself from them.

00:57.447 --> 01:00.177
That, of course, I have to give you a push, no doubt,

01:00.298 --> 01:02.528
and I am working hard on that to give you a push.

01:02.649 --> 01:06.391
But you should also know that mythical things must be dropped out,

01:06.511 --> 01:09.791
otherwise you will not grow.

01:09.991 --> 01:13.591
All mythical things must be dropped out.

01:13.711 --> 01:17.031
And the best way to do it is to be in thoughtless awareness

01:17.151 --> 01:20.231
because as soon as you transcend these three gunas

01:20.351 --> 01:21.791
you become thoughtlessly aware.

01:21.911 --> 01:26.231
You have to cross Agya. Once you cross Agya, these three gunas,

01:26.351 --> 01:30.271
absolutely you go into a state where you are gunateet,

01:30.391 --> 01:33.311
you are beyond gunas.

01:34.671 --> 01:38.871
So you do not deliberately do anything,

01:38.991 --> 01:42.108
but it just works out.

01:42.241 --> 01:45.827
So now for you, because you are enlightened now, is to understand

01:45.947 --> 01:53.787
that our attention has to move higher and higher, at a higher space.

01:53.937 --> 01:57.337
Now actually what has happened in Realisation?

01:57.457 --> 02:03.485
Your Kundalini has risen and has come up,

02:03.681 --> 02:11.980
just like, you can say, a small, thin hair, one hair,

02:14.210 --> 02:18.744
and that has broken your Sahastrara

02:19.244 --> 02:23.573
and now the grace is flowing into you.

02:24.407 --> 02:27.572
But it’s a very small movement that has taken place, of course

02:27.692 --> 02:31.890
which is a very difficult movement no doubt, but it has taken place.

02:33.795 --> 02:39.155
Now you have not expanded like this.

02:39.275 --> 02:43.377
Your chakras are only pierced in the centre,

02:43.497 --> 02:46.420
but the rest of the attention is still intact.

02:46.540 --> 02:52.354
Actually it is so intact, that you don’t even feel that it is pierced.

02:52.474 --> 02:58.584
Now you have to expand that, open it out,

02:58.893 --> 03:04.075
so that more strands of Kundalini can rise

03:04.511 --> 03:12.671
and your attention, which is in these centers, expands.

03:14.092 --> 03:18.772
By expansion it drives out all that is mythical on the sides.

03:18.893 --> 03:24.653
On every centre we have our attention,

03:24.773 --> 03:27.653
which is being enlightened in the centre

03:27.773 --> 03:31.152
through this Light passing through.

03:31.359 --> 03:36.514
But the Light is too small for the darkness that you have collected.

03:37.807 --> 03:40.334
Specially for the people of the West, I would say,

03:40.454 --> 03:44.974
your confusions, you must get rid of them.

03:46.714 --> 03:48.514
But still you identify.

03:48.634 --> 03:51.351
Because if I ask you anything [like], “How are you?”

03:51.471 --> 03:53.581
Means what?

03:55.441 --> 03:58.976
Means you are still confused.

03:59.096 --> 04:00.739
Alright?

04:04.096 --> 04:06.801
Confusion should go.

04:07.364 --> 04:12.303
One confusion was there that, “This is Realisation or not?”

04:12.423 --> 04:14.501
I hope that’s over now with you people.

04:14.621 --> 04:17.478
At least now you believe it is Self-realisation.

04:17.598 --> 04:20.862
I had to tell people, “No, you are self-realised now, you are!”

04:20.982 --> 04:24.178
Still they would jump up like [a] jack-in-the-box, you see.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.155
They’ll say, “No, we’re not Mother!

04:26.275 --> 04:28.282
How do you say this is Realisation?”

04:28.402 --> 04:32.860
“We expect this out of Realisation and that out of Realisation

04:32.980 --> 04:35.700
– that we’ll be flying out of the door if we are Realised,”

04:35.820 --> 04:37.620
or something nonsensical like that.

04:37.740 --> 04:40.018
Thank God, these ideas have gone away.

04:40.138 --> 04:45.738
But when we are Realised, there is Light that has come in us,

04:46.097 --> 04:50.083
we have to grow it only by separating our attention

04:50.203 --> 04:52.356
from the myths.

04:54.103 --> 04:56.772
It’s all mythical.

04:56.892 --> 04:58.457
I also play with you,

04:58.577 --> 05:04.384
because unless and until you are sure,

05:04.504 --> 05:11.598
I am not going to give you a wrong idea about yourself.

05:12.784 --> 05:17.691
I want to see how far still your attention is moving,

05:17.811 --> 05:22.371
and I know [that] still you are not sure,

05:23.577 --> 05:26.505
still you are not sure of yourself,

05:29.608 --> 05:34.861
that’s why the confidence is not there.

05:37.091 --> 05:42.202
First of all you have to learn how to drive, then you are tested.

05:42.322 --> 05:45.865
There will be five stones put together,

05:45.985 --> 05:50.343
the distance will be only that hardly a car can pass through

05:50.463 --> 05:53.316
and the fellow will say, “You bring it zigzag!”

05:53.436 --> 05:55.437
And you cannot do it.

05:55.557 --> 05:56.597
Why?

05:58.940 --> 06:03.646
That’s how he makes you a master.

06:04.796 --> 06:08.061
The mastery of your attention

06:08.181 --> 06:14.436
will come when you will start seeing that it is all a myth that upsets you.

06:14.849 --> 06:17.971
It’s all a myth that upsets you.

06:18.091 --> 06:20.682
Just throw it away.

06:22.627 --> 06:26.122
Just throw it away and understand

06:26.243 --> 06:31.206
that you are the eternal attention,

06:32.619 --> 06:37.149
that you are the eternal life,

06:37.730 --> 06:43.658
that [the] only thing that keeps you away from it is ignorance,

06:44.444 --> 06:48.678
and the ignorance is too simple to understand:

06:48.798 --> 06:53.182
that you have accepted myth as Truth.

06:54.278 --> 06:57.749
Just drop it! It’s all myth!

06:58.630 --> 07:04.033
You’ll be amazed how your attention will rise

07:05.156 --> 07:09.215
and you’ll see all these nonsensical things

07:09.366 --> 07:12.795
which used to frighten you or to elate you,

07:12.915 --> 07:17.355
will drop out, and you will just smile at it.

07:17.528 --> 07:22.206
And then only you are going to enjoy yourself fully

07:22.326 --> 07:24.541
because your attention

07:24.661 --> 07:30.002
will be completely drenched into the bliss of Self.

07:32.643 --> 07:37.387
I am saying you will, I say you are

07:38.618 --> 07:43.156
already drenched into that bliss.

07:44.299 --> 07:46.339
Keep it up.

07:46.838 --> 07:50.338
Now, how to do it?

07:52.163 --> 07:58.934
Actually, in every day-to-day life, how to kill the memory of the past?

08:02.668 --> 08:08.055
To kill the memory of the past is to have new memories.

08:09.865 --> 08:14.157
You must remember when you got your first Realisation

08:16.102 --> 08:17.866
– always think of it.

08:17.986 --> 08:21.361
Whenever any such memory comes to you,

08:21.481 --> 08:25.929
you [should] try to think how you got your Realisation.

08:26.763 --> 08:32.043
Any memory that is troublesome or even so-called elating,

08:32.163 --> 08:40.343
you just try to remember how Realisation has come to you.

08:42.246 --> 08:47.190
When you feel aggressive about something or angry [about] something,

08:47.310 --> 08:53.326
just try to remember how you felt the joy of surrendering.

08:55.676 --> 09:02.010
Just think of that joy of surrendering, of dissolving yourself.

09:02.748 --> 09:06.331
So the new memories must be built up.

09:06.490 --> 09:10.341
If you start building up new memories,

09:10.461 --> 09:13.896
then you will start collecting moments

09:14.016 --> 09:23.618
to establish other moments which have such memories.

09:25.015 --> 09:28.738
Like a memory when you tried to help somebody,

09:28.858 --> 09:32.779
you raised the Kundalini of someone.

09:33.453 --> 09:36.845
Now the problem would be when you will be raising the Kundalini of others,

09:36.966 --> 09:40.106
you will be in thoughtless awareness – there won’t be any thought –

09:40.227 --> 09:43.684
and thought is the only thing which impresses.

09:43.804 --> 09:51.097
But [at] that time you can record the joy of raising the Kundalini.

09:51.330 --> 09:58.114
If you could record the joy of raising the Kundalini of others,

10:01.638 --> 10:07.458
you will feel [that] a new wealth

10:07.578 --> 10:12.884
of these beautiful moments will be accumulated.

10:13.004 --> 10:19.230
And all those moments which were giving you confusion

10:19.350 --> 10:25.124
or fear or so-called unhappiness and happiness will drop out

10:25.244 --> 10:28.128
and pure joy will remain.

10:28.249 --> 10:34.627
Because now most of the experiences you have had are more of joy.

10:35.888 --> 10:38.447
Joy has no thoughts.

10:38.567 --> 10:44.073
It’s just an experience, a pratyaksha.

10:46.359 --> 10:49.532
That’s why I said you keep your eyes open.

10:52.844 --> 10:56.239
I hope you will understand what I mean by that.

10:57.970 --> 10:59.787
May God bless you all.
