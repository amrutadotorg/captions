00:00:07.711 --> 00:00:11.351
But if your attention goes higher

00:00:11.471 --> 00:00:16.111
– say [as] my attention is. I am only nothing but charity! I mean what am I?

00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:23.231
It just flows. You just become the charity.

00:00:24.551 --> 00:00:26.424
So the difference between

00:00:26.545 --> 00:00:30.351
a person who is a realised and a not realised is this

00:00:30.471 --> 00:00:38.751
that the attention which was giving myth as reality to you

00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:41.351
is gone now, is gone higher.

00:00:41.471 --> 00:00:44.151
It can see that it is myth.

00:00:44.271 --> 00:00:47.791
Attention can clearly see that it is myth,

00:00:47.911 --> 00:00:53.871
and you can see that yourself and you can remove yourself from them.

00:00:57.447 --> 00:01:00.177
That, of course, I have to give you a push, no doubt,

00:01:00.298 --> 00:01:02.528
and I am working hard on that to give you a push.

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.391
But you should also know that mythical things must be dropped out,

00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:09.791
otherwise you will not grow.

00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:13.591
All mythical things must be dropped out.

00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:17.031
And the best way to do it is to be in thoughtless awareness

00:01:17.151 --> 00:01:20.231
because as soon as you transcend these three gunas

00:01:20.351 --> 00:01:21.791
you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:01:21.911 --> 00:01:26.231
You have to cross Agya. Once you cross Agya, these three gunas,

00:01:26.351 --> 00:01:30.271
absolutely you go into a state where you are gunateet,

00:01:30.391 --> 00:01:33.311
you are beyond gunas.

00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:38.871
So you do not deliberately do anything,

00:01:38.991 --> 00:01:42.108
but it just works out.

00:01:42.241 --> 00:01:45.827
So now for you, because you are enlightened now, is to understand

00:01:45.947 --> 00:01:53.787
that our attention has to move higher and higher, at a higher space.

00:01:53.937 --> 00:01:57.337
Now actually what has happened in Realisation?

00:01:57.457 --> 00:02:03.485
Your Kundalini has risen and has come up,

00:02:03.681 --> 00:02:11.980
just like, you can say, a small, thin hair, one hair,

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.744
and that has broken your Sahastrara

00:02:19.244 --> 00:02:23.573
and now the grace is flowing into you.

00:02:24.407 --> 00:02:27.572
But it’s a very small movement that has taken place, of course

00:02:27.692 --> 00:02:31.890
which is a very difficult movement no doubt, but it has taken place.

00:02:33.795 --> 00:02:39.155
Now you have not expanded like this.

00:02:39.275 --> 00:02:43.377
Your chakras are only pierced in the centre,

00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:46.420
but the rest of the attention is still intact.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.354
Actually it is so intact, that you don’t even feel that it is pierced.

00:02:52.474 --> 00:02:58.584
Now you have to expand that, open it out,

00:02:58.893 --> 00:03:04.075
so that more strands of Kundalini can rise

00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:12.671
and your attention, which is in these centers, expands.

00:03:14.092 --> 00:03:18.772
By expansion it drives out all that is mythical on the sides.

00:03:18.893 --> 00:03:24.653
On every centre we have our attention,

00:03:24.773 --> 00:03:27.653
which is being enlightened in the centre

00:03:27.773 --> 00:03:31.152
through this Light passing through.

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:36.514
But the Light is too small for the darkness that you have collected.

00:03:37.807 --> 00:03:40.334
Specially for the people of the West, I would say,

00:03:40.454 --> 00:03:44.974
your confusions, you must get rid of them.

00:03:46.714 --> 00:03:48.514
But still you identify.

00:03:48.634 --> 00:03:51.351
Because if I ask you anything [like], “How are you?”

00:03:51.471 --> 00:03:53.581
Means what?

00:03:55.441 --> 00:03:58.976
Means you are still confused.

00:03:59.096 --> 00:04:00.739
Alright?

00:04:04.096 --> 00:04:06.801
Confusion should go.

00:04:07.364 --> 00:04:12.303
One confusion was there that, “This is Realisation or not?”

00:04:12.423 --> 00:04:14.501
I hope that’s over now with you people.

00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:17.478
At least now you believe it is Self-realisation.

00:04:17.598 --> 00:04:20.862
I had to tell people, “No, you are self-realised now, you are!”

00:04:20.982 --> 00:04:24.178
Still they would jump up like [a] jack-in-the-box, you see.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.155
They’ll say, “No, we’re not Mother!

00:04:26.275 --> 00:04:28.282
How do you say this is Realisation?”

00:04:28.402 --> 00:04:32.860
“We expect this out of Realisation and that out of Realisation

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.700
– that we’ll be flying out of the door if we are Realised,”

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.620
or something nonsensical like that.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.018
Thank God, these ideas have gone away.

00:04:40.138 --> 00:04:45.738
But when we are Realised, there is Light that has come in us,

00:04:46.097 --> 00:04:50.083
we have to grow it only by separating our attention

00:04:50.203 --> 00:04:52.356
from the myths.

00:04:54.103 --> 00:04:56.772
It’s all mythical.

00:04:56.892 --> 00:04:58.457
I also play with you,

00:04:58.577 --> 00:05:04.384
because unless and until you are sure,

00:05:04.504 --> 00:05:11.598
I am not going to give you a wrong idea about yourself.

00:05:12.784 --> 00:05:17.691
I want to see how far still your attention is moving,

00:05:17.811 --> 00:05:22.371
and I know [that] still you are not sure,

00:05:23.577 --> 00:05:26.505
still you are not sure of yourself,

00:05:29.608 --> 00:05:34.861
that’s why the confidence is not there.

00:05:37.091 --> 00:05:42.202
First of all you have to learn how to drive, then you are tested.

00:05:42.322 --> 00:05:45.865
There will be five stones put together,

00:05:45.985 --> 00:05:50.343
the distance will be only that hardly a car can pass through

00:05:50.463 --> 00:05:53.316
and the fellow will say, “You bring it zigzag!”

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:55.437
And you cannot do it.

00:05:55.557 --> 00:05:56.597
Why?

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.646
That’s how he makes you a master.

00:06:04.796 --> 00:06:08.061
The mastery of your attention

00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:14.436
will come when you will start seeing that it is all a myth that upsets you.

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:17.971
It’s all a myth that upsets you.

00:06:18.091 --> 00:06:20.682
Just throw it away.

00:06:22.627 --> 00:06:26.122
Just throw it away and understand

00:06:26.243 --> 00:06:31.206
that you are the eternal attention,

00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:37.149
that you are the eternal life,

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:43.658
that [the] only thing that keeps you away from it is ignorance,

00:06:44.444 --> 00:06:48.678
and the ignorance is too simple to understand:

00:06:48.798 --> 00:06:53.182
that you have accepted myth as Truth.

00:06:54.278 --> 00:06:57.749
Just drop it! It’s all myth!

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:04.033
You’ll be amazed how your attention will rise

00:07:05.156 --> 00:07:09.215
and you’ll see all these nonsensical things

00:07:09.366 --> 00:07:12.795
which used to frighten you or to elate you,

00:07:12.915 --> 00:07:17.355
will drop out, and you will just smile at it.

00:07:17.528 --> 00:07:22.206
And then only you are going to enjoy yourself fully

00:07:22.326 --> 00:07:24.541
because your attention

00:07:24.661 --> 00:07:30.002
will be completely drenched into the bliss of Self.

00:07:32.643 --> 00:07:37.387
I am saying you will, I say you are

00:07:38.618 --> 00:07:43.156
already drenched into that bliss.

00:07:44.299 --> 00:07:46.339
Keep it up.

00:07:46.838 --> 00:07:50.338
Now, how to do it?

00:07:52.163 --> 00:07:58.934
Actually, in every day-to-day life, how to kill the memory of the past?

00:08:02.668 --> 00:08:08.055
To kill the memory of the past is to have new memories.

00:08:09.865 --> 00:08:14.157
You must remember when you got your first Realisation

00:08:16.102 --> 00:08:17.866
– always think of it.

00:08:17.986 --> 00:08:21.361
Whenever any such memory comes to you,

00:08:21.481 --> 00:08:25.929
you [should] try to think how you got your Realisation.

00:08:26.763 --> 00:08:32.043
Any memory that is troublesome or even so-called elating,

00:08:32.163 --> 00:08:40.343
you just try to remember how Realisation has come to you.

00:08:42.246 --> 00:08:47.190
When you feel aggressive about something or angry [about] something,

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:53.326
just try to remember how you felt the joy of surrendering.

00:08:55.676 --> 00:09:02.010
Just think of that joy of surrendering, of dissolving yourself.

00:09:02.748 --> 00:09:06.331
So the new memories must be built up.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:10.341
If you start building up new memories,

00:09:10.461 --> 00:09:13.896
then you will start collecting moments

00:09:14.016 --> 00:09:23.618
to establish other moments which have such memories.

00:09:25.015 --> 00:09:28.738
Like a memory when you tried to help somebody,

00:09:28.858 --> 00:09:32.779
you raised the Kundalini of someone.

00:09:33.453 --> 00:09:36.845
Now the problem would be when you will be raising the Kundalini of others,

00:09:36.966 --> 00:09:40.106
you will be in thoughtless awareness – there won’t be any thought –

00:09:40.227 --> 00:09:43.684
and thought is the only thing which impresses.

00:09:43.804 --> 00:09:51.097
But [at] that time you can record the joy of raising the Kundalini.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:58.114
If you could record the joy of raising the Kundalini of others,

00:10:01.638 --> 00:10:07.458
you will feel [that] a new wealth

00:10:07.578 --> 00:10:12.884
of these beautiful moments will be accumulated.

00:10:13.004 --> 00:10:19.230
And all those moments which were giving you confusion

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:25.124
or fear or so-called unhappiness and happiness will drop out

00:10:25.244 --> 00:10:28.128
and pure joy will remain.

00:10:28.249 --> 00:10:34.627
Because now most of the experiences you have had are more of joy.

00:10:35.888 --> 00:10:38.447
Joy has no thoughts.

00:10:38.567 --> 00:10:44.073
It’s just an experience, a pratyaksha.

00:10:46.359 --> 00:10:49.532
That’s why I said you keep your eyes open.

00:10:52.844 --> 00:10:56.239
I hope you will understand what I mean by that.

00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:59.787
May God bless you all.
