WEBVTT

00:08.024 --> 00:15.854
Today, we have to know something about the connection

00:16.055 --> 00:20.713
of Sahaja Yoga with this Mother Earth.

00:20.914 --> 00:22.713
It is very important,

00:22.914 --> 00:28.023
that we must understand the value of the Mother Earth.

00:28.922 --> 00:30.877
She has been very kind to all of you,

00:31.078 --> 00:33.674
She has been sucking your vibrations.

00:33.875 --> 00:36.554
She has been, otherwise also,

00:36.755 --> 00:41.874
She has given you everything that you see around.

00:42.075 --> 00:49.397
So today, we have to understand the connection,

00:49.598 --> 00:54.920
and the symbolic expression of the Mother Earth within ourselves.

00:55.121 --> 00:58.764
I have told you before also that

00:58.965 --> 01:02.366
Kundalini, which is in three and a half coils

01:02.567 --> 01:09.348
is placed within a triangular bone.

01:09.684 --> 01:16.342
Now this abode of the Kundalini is called as Mooladhara,

01:16.543 --> 01:23.764
and is represented in the universe as this Mother Earth.

01:25.801 --> 01:28.819
Or in the puja, it is represented as the Kumbha.

01:29.020 --> 01:32.020
I don’t know if you have made the Kumbha or not? Have you?

01:32.221 --> 01:36.746
Yes. The Kumbha is it here.

01:44.467 --> 01:50.875
So far, in the movement of our consciousness,

01:51.076 --> 02:00.499
we have been trying to understand the God Almighty

02:00.700 --> 02:07.562
and all other five elements that we call as important.

02:17.652 --> 02:21.911
And also,

02:22.112 --> 02:25.864
the consciousness has been moving

02:26.065 --> 02:32.481
towards the understanding of

02:32.682 --> 02:38.291
all the other four elements but the Mother Earth.

02:40.096 --> 02:43.536
That had to be such, because unless and until

02:43.737 --> 02:49.270
the understanding of all these four other elements

02:49.471 --> 02:52.801
are brought to a certain degree,

02:53.002 --> 02:55.707
the Mother Earth cannot express itself.

02:55.908 --> 03:00.262
Like if all your chakras, four chakras, are caught up,

03:00.463 --> 03:03.246
you cannot raise the Kundalini,

03:03.447 --> 03:06.238
you cannot give Self-Realization.

03:06.439 --> 03:10.652
You cannot have a mass evolutionary process done.

03:10.853 --> 03:15.261
That’s why we had yagyas,

03:15.462 --> 03:20.870
all other methods of exciting the four elements.

03:21.071 --> 03:23.893
They worshipped the water

03:24.094 --> 03:30.922
and they worshipped air, the sky, the firmament, the light.

03:33.627 --> 03:36.945
And that’s how they came up to the time of Christ

03:37.146 --> 03:42.356
where light was worshipped.

03:44.373 --> 03:50.008
But today when we are in this modern Sahaja Yoga,

03:50.209 --> 03:53.321
we are actually at the level of the Mother Earth,

03:53.522 --> 03:56.110
because this is the age of the Aquarius.

03:56.311 --> 04:00.977
And Aquarius is the same as the Kumbha—

04:01.178 --> 04:03.852
is the Mother Earth.

04:04.053 --> 04:09.021
So we are at the level of the Mother Earth.

04:10.186 --> 04:15.313
You can also see in the consciousness of human beings;

04:15.514 --> 04:19.532
I’m saying not only men, but women also and men.

04:19.733 --> 04:22.962
The consciousness is moving more towards

04:23.163 --> 04:28.564
the feminine expression of life.

04:28.765 --> 04:31.212
But as stupid as human beings are,

04:31.413 --> 04:35.470
the feminists also have been very stupid,

04:35.671 --> 04:40.403
that they are fighting on the level of rationality,

04:40.604 --> 04:45.239
of economics, of politics—all useless things.

04:45.440 --> 04:48.356
Equality on all these things if they are to be sought,

04:48.557 --> 04:52.614
you become men, you just become like men.

04:52.815 --> 04:55.421
If you are argumentative, if you are rational,

04:55.622 --> 04:59.741
if you talk like man, it’s a masculine development.

04:59.942 --> 05:03.062
But the Mothers development, the feminine development,

05:03.263 --> 05:08.351
is not equality in the way the men have been stupid.

05:08.552 --> 05:11.273
No use competing with men in their stupidity,

05:11.474 --> 05:14.240
the amount of stupidity has been created already for us

05:14.441 --> 05:16.842
quite sufficiently.

05:17.043 --> 05:20.733
The whole world is today, is expressing that nonsense

05:20.934 --> 05:25.866
that they have—the competition, the aggression, the oppression.

05:26.067 --> 05:29.264
So the other side of the woman, which was called as the

05:29.465 --> 05:34.794
dominated one, the dark side, the oppressed and all that

05:34.995 --> 05:37.424
has to express itself in a different way.

05:37.625 --> 05:41.768
The whole mode, the style, has to change.

05:41.969 --> 05:44.635
See now, in Christianity one should understand;

05:44.836 --> 05:47.658
why Christianity, even Judaism, any religion,

05:47.859 --> 05:51.150
even Hinduism and all that

05:51.351 --> 05:54.101
but its more in Christianity, surprisingly

05:54.302 --> 06:00.476
they just had no place for Mary.

06:00.677 --> 06:06.617
And Muslims even crowned it by completely canceling Fatima.

06:06.818 --> 06:12.515
And on top of that,

06:12.716 --> 06:16.999
you will see that among Christians, I think that ordination,

06:17.200 --> 06:20.782
or what you call that, is not given to the lady to women,

06:20.983 --> 06:26.061
while Christ was not born of a man.

06:27.811 --> 06:31.227
But that does not in any way mean that you compete men

06:31.428 --> 06:36.792
in their foolish enterprises by which they have practically

06:36.993 --> 06:40.597
brought this world to such a ruinous state.

06:40.798 --> 06:46.824
So today we have to understand that it is the time for

06:47.025 --> 06:50.680
the motherly qualities to develop. Even a man,

06:50.881 --> 06:54.274
when he becomes motherly only, becomes a great man.

06:54.475 --> 07:01.360
Like Christ, when he had compassion, he was called as a saint.

07:01.561 --> 07:06.008
So the quality of a woman as a Mother—

07:06.209 --> 07:09.594
Goddess is always as a Mother—

07:09.795 --> 07:13.908
and She is the power most important to ignite Sahaja Yoga.

07:14.109 --> 07:17.002
Now how She ignites, I’ll tell you.

07:17.203 --> 07:20.611
I’ll give an analogy, but analogy should not be carried too far—

07:20.812 --> 07:25.213
as wise Sahaja Yogis you should not carry it too far.

07:25.414 --> 07:28.557
Say there is a zero, it has no meaning.

07:28.758 --> 07:32.284
In the same way God Almighty has no meaning,

07:32.485 --> 07:37.284
till you put some sort of one or two before it.

07:37.485 --> 07:40.331
It’s a zero. It has an existence

07:40.532 --> 07:44.831
but it has no capacity or a power to express itself.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.425
So it’s a zero.

07:46.626 --> 07:51.113
Like that we should say the masculine growth is a zero.

07:51.314 --> 07:53.863
Another analogy I will give you to understand it.

07:54.064 --> 07:59.301
That if you see

07:59.502 --> 08:05.504
very high power wires, going over your heads,

08:05.705 --> 08:09.304
they are absolutely harmless, there’s no trouble.

08:09.505 --> 08:13.365
In Delhi there was a suggestion that there is a very big plot of

08:13.566 --> 08:18.655
available where there are high power wires are going

08:18.856 --> 08:22.999
and we can have it for free. I asked "What is the problem?"

08:23.200 --> 08:26.717
They said only, if earth gets connected with that

08:26.918 --> 08:30.342
then you will have problem.

08:30.543 --> 08:33.932
So till these-this high power thing, whatever it is—

08:34.133 --> 08:38.612
is not connected with the earth, it has no meaning at all.

08:38.813 --> 08:44.105
But earth is very different from this dynamic power

08:44.306 --> 08:49.855
that is flowing through those wires, which are zero,

08:50.056 --> 08:53.337
which mean nothing.

08:54.204 --> 08:57.401
In the same way, in a woman,

08:57.602 --> 09:03.117
the womb of a woman is the Kundalini.

09:03.563 --> 09:07.175
Now what is a womb? Now, if that is the Kundalini,

09:07.376 --> 09:09.800
that expresses the Kundalini in the gross;

09:10.001 --> 09:14.214
that means the Mother Earth is also like the womb.

09:14.415 --> 09:17.722
Now what does a womb do?

09:17.923 --> 09:22.542
It receives the sperm,

09:22.743 --> 09:26.760
which is just a frivolous act of man

09:26.961 --> 09:30.244
or you can say just an aggression,

09:30.445 --> 09:34.213
and she then nourishes -

09:34.414 --> 09:38.752
looks after it, corrects it

09:38.953 --> 09:43.299
and allows it to grow, not in an aggressive way

09:43.500 --> 09:47.752
but in a very compassionate and a sensible way,

09:47.953 --> 09:54.171
till it is expelled out of the womb when it is grown up.

09:55.453 --> 09:59.752
So the idea of womb is that the expression has to be

09:59.953 --> 10:05.190
in such a manner that it does not dominate.

10:05.391 --> 10:09.362
It does not dominate the embryo.

10:09.563 --> 10:12.003
If it dominates, how can it grow?

10:12.204 --> 10:16.011
So it nourishes it and makes it grow.

10:16.212 --> 10:18.706
This is what today’s Sahaja Yoga is.

10:18.907 --> 10:21.987
That now the Mother Earth is the one,

10:22.188 --> 10:27.378
who is symbolized within you as the Mooladhara,

10:27.579 --> 10:31.292
as symbolized as the AdiShakti here-

10:31.493 --> 10:35.097
is sitting down before you to nourish you,

10:35.298 --> 10:38.269
to make you grow into new personalities—

10:38.470 --> 10:42.102
into mature personalities.

10:43.423 --> 10:47.524
This concept we must understand.

10:48.118 --> 10:50.886
So the women of the West must understand

10:51.087 --> 10:53.630
that the nonsensical ideas they have taken from men

10:53.831 --> 10:59.075
must be completely discarded. They have to become women first.

10:59.276 --> 11:02.864
Those women who just are talking like men,

11:03.065 --> 11:06.841
can never help in Sahaja Yoga.

11:07.042 --> 11:12.263
They have to be like this Mother Earth who allows you

11:12.464 --> 11:14.716
to do what you like with Her.

11:14.917 --> 11:17.553
I mean you human beings have been so stupid

11:17.754 --> 11:20.483
to exploit Her to the maximum,

11:20.684 --> 11:26.075
not onlyt hat but also She

11:26.276 --> 11:29.232
bears lot of nonsense upon Herself.

11:29.433 --> 11:33.912
But then a time reaches where She becomes explosive,

11:34.113 --> 11:39.170
then She starts consuming people inside Herself.

11:39.371 --> 11:42.350
And when She is consuming people

11:42.551 --> 11:46.608
then you see the earthquakes and droughts and this and that,

11:46.809 --> 11:51.663
all these things start coming in and people get engulfed

11:51.864 --> 11:56.538
into these problems

11:56.739 --> 12:01.324
which they blame Mother Earth for that.

12:07.609 --> 12:10.541
The problems that human beings have created

12:10.742 --> 12:15.549
out of aggressive nature—even aggression towards the Mother Earth,

12:15.750 --> 12:20.377
they have to pay dividend for that. And they are paying.

12:20.578 --> 12:24.572
Now, to stop this kind of a movement of aggressiveness

12:24.773 --> 12:27.416
which brings all kinds of disturbances,

12:27.617 --> 12:31.549
one has to recede back and should develop

12:31.750 --> 12:36.463
the sense of totality, of compassion.

12:36.664 --> 12:41.065
Unless and until, you understand totality,

12:41.266 --> 12:43.393
the total, the complete, the whole—

12:43.594 --> 12:48.721
that’s the womb that’s your Mother.

12:48.922 --> 12:51.916
As long as you try to be individualistic

12:52.117 --> 12:56.611
you cannot be a good Sahaja Yogi.

12:56.812 --> 13:01.119
You have to become one with the whole.

13:01.320 --> 13:04.865
Now we have to face ourselves for that, very important it is.

13:05.066 --> 13:08.545
Specially in the west, I would say we have to face ourselves

13:08.746 --> 13:11.733
very clearly—what are we up to?

13:11.934 --> 13:15.863
That’s a very important thing.

13:17.926 --> 13:22.863
First of all let us see where is our attention.

13:23.551 --> 13:28.811
Ask a question. We are Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yogis

13:29.012 --> 13:33.475
within our fold

13:33.676 --> 13:38.733
and I am sometimes surprised that even now,

13:38.934 --> 13:43.121
the attention can be very funny.

13:44.981 --> 13:48.241
Like, simple thing, like we can have attention

13:48.442 --> 13:52.098
on material things:

13:53.458 --> 13:58.593
"this is mine-this is yours;

13:58.794 --> 14:01.835
that I should have my privacy." Then you are gone into

14:02.036 --> 14:05.741
the another realm of aggressiveness.

14:05.942 --> 14:08.061
If you try to have your own privacy,

14:08.262 --> 14:15.769
then you are depriving others of their privacy.

14:16.308 --> 14:19.680
It was all right when you were not Sahaja Yogis,

14:19.881 --> 14:22.227
to have your privacy, because you had to grow

14:22.428 --> 14:26.758
in your privacy at that time. But after Sahaja Yoga

14:26.959 --> 14:33.899
you have to become one with everyone else—

14:34.100 --> 14:37.235
that is very important. Before Sahaja Yoga

14:37.436 --> 14:43.118
you were different and after Sahaja Yoga you are different.

14:43.319 --> 14:48.259
The whole concept must change after Sahaja Yoga.

14:48.460 --> 14:51.392
That now you have become one with the whole

14:51.593 --> 14:54.697
and to feel that you are one with the whole,

14:54.898 --> 15:00.111
you should try to give up all your individualistic attitudes.

15:00.312 --> 15:07.330
That’s very common now to hear "Yes, I like this, I like that."

15:08.858 --> 15:12.463
It’s very common: "I like it." Very common.

15:12.664 --> 15:17.960
But doesn’t behove a Sahaja Yogi to say such a thing.

15:19.031 --> 15:24.072
You see, how can I say that I like some thing?

15:24.273 --> 15:29.588
Think of a mother who has to bear the child,

15:29.789 --> 15:34.822
has to give birth to a child, has to look after the child,

15:35.023 --> 15:39.197
the needs of the child, protect the child,

15:39.398 --> 15:41.603
train the child. How can she say:

15:41.804 --> 15:46.108
"I like this" and "I like that"! Where is the time?

15:46.578 --> 15:49.697
To think what you like and what you don’t like,

15:49.898 --> 15:55.244
"I like this food, I like that food". Where is the time?

15:55.445 --> 15:58.744
Where is the energy left for that? Where is the attention?

15:58.945 --> 16:05.463
The attention is on the upbringing of the child.

16:05.664 --> 16:11.244
Now in the same way a Sahaja Yogi must know that

16:11.445 --> 16:16.517
the child within him is born—

16:16.718 --> 16:19.080
the Spirit.

16:19.281 --> 16:22.908
Spirit is the child

16:23.109 --> 16:25.728
which has been born within him,

16:25.929 --> 16:30.884
now he has to nourish, through the Kundalini.

16:31.085 --> 16:35.181
He has to water it, he has to look after it.

16:35.382 --> 16:38.884
It has to make it grow. Now where is the time

16:39.085 --> 16:42.173
for other nonsensical things? You have a child in hand.

16:42.374 --> 16:47.517
You are all mothers looking after your child—that’s your Spirit.

16:47.718 --> 16:51.509
So where do you have time for all these things?

16:51.710 --> 16:53.478
What attention should be:

16:53.679 --> 16:56.861
"What can I do to make this child happy,

16:57.062 --> 17:01.080
to make this child grow, to make this child

17:01.281 --> 17:03.932
completely manifest my self."

17:04.133 --> 17:07.471
The mother replaces herself

17:07.672 --> 17:11.416
as soon as the child becomes a mature child.

17:11.617 --> 17:13.971
So now in you, the Motherhood

17:14.172 --> 17:18.159
must take over than the Fatherhood.

17:18.360 --> 17:21.518
Motherhood towards yourself. The attitude should be

17:21.719 --> 17:24.354
like a Mother towards the child.

17:24.555 --> 17:27.018
How her attention is towards the child?

17:27.219 --> 17:32.057
You can see in every day-to-day life how we behave.

17:32.258 --> 17:36.784
I have seen people very much interested even now, in food.

17:36.985 --> 17:39.495
I mean, where is the time? Where is the attention?

17:39.696 --> 17:42.433
How can you be so much worried about your food?

17:42.634 --> 17:45.503
Worried about your sleep. Worried about your health;

17:45.704 --> 17:49.737
worried about this-that? I mean, here you are to worry about your child

17:49.938 --> 17:52.268
which you have got now within.

17:52.469 --> 17:56.015
And that’s why the child is neglected and sometimes you find

17:56.040 --> 18:01.055
the child becomes sick or sometimes goes into a coma

18:01.256 --> 18:04.844
or may die away also.

18:05.045 --> 18:09.055
So the situation is very different now for Sahaja Yogis:

18:09.256 --> 18:13.313
"how to treat themselves?"

18:13.514 --> 18:16.454
Those who are running after still food

18:16.655 --> 18:19.665
and all these nonsensical things. I mean have seen Sahaja Yogis,

18:19.866 --> 18:24.412
all their attention is on food all the time.

18:25.155 --> 18:27.673
How dedication can come in a person

18:27.874 --> 18:33.233
who is so much dedicated to food habits?

18:33.874 --> 18:38.165
Like, we have seen,

18:38.366 --> 18:41.774
you might have also seen—some of you—Ajanta caves were built.

18:41.975 --> 18:45.563
In ten generations they built Ajanta caves,

18:45.764 --> 18:49.969
ten generations! And

18:50.170 --> 18:54.578
they built it in a place where there was not even water available—

18:54.779 --> 18:57.586
to begin with.

18:57.787 --> 19:00.680
And day in and day out thousands of people,

19:00.881 --> 19:05.219
without getting any payment, without getting anything, built it.

19:05.420 --> 19:07.321
No food—no question!

19:07.522 --> 19:10.477
They used to eat some fruits somewhere here, there,

19:10.678 --> 19:15.420
but their dedication gave them power to do it.

19:16.858 --> 19:19.532
But this dedication can only be developed

19:19.733 --> 19:25.404
if you realize that you have to Mother your child.

19:27.943 --> 19:32.802
Now if the mother is ugly, the child will be ugly too.

19:33.003 --> 19:36.919
Because it is the mother who is expressed in the child.

19:37.120 --> 19:39.239
She doesn’t dominate the child all right,

19:39.440 --> 19:45.244
but she definitely can corrupt the image of the child.

19:46.448 --> 19:52.083
And that’s what exactly happens when we, the Sahaja Yogis,

19:52.284 --> 19:55.286
are not bothered as to look after our Spirit

19:55.487 --> 20:00.111
and our spiritual growth. Even now, you will be surprised,

20:00.312 --> 20:03.900
fifty percent people write letters to Me:

20:04.101 --> 20:06.978
"Mother I am still possessed,

20:07.179 --> 20:10.376
I have worked with lemons and chilies,

20:10.577 --> 20:13.790
I am coming to you for this and that."

20:13.991 --> 20:17.811
It is a very low-grade business. I think even after so many years

20:17.836 --> 20:21.124
if you are possessed, then I think you should beat yourself

20:21.149 --> 20:23.153
every day hundred and eight times.

20:23.354 --> 20:29.481
It’s a very low grade behavior, I personally think,

20:29.682 --> 20:33.396
that after your Mother has worked so hard with you;

20:33.421 --> 20:37.283
you are still just the same, coming back with the

20:37.308 --> 20:43.127
horrible idea of bringing

20:43.152 --> 20:47.440
all kinds of problems to your Mother.

20:49.019 --> 20:53.756
That means you have not looking after your child.

20:53.957 --> 20:57.029
Now in Sahaja Yoga it’s not a child

20:57.230 --> 21:00.404
which is an individual child you have to look after.

21:00.605 --> 21:05.342
This is, one should understand. This is where we miss very much,

21:05.543 --> 21:08.545
especially by the intellectuals.

21:08.746 --> 21:12.717
They think it is their own child which should be all right,

21:12.918 --> 21:16.941
doesn’t matter about others’ children. Or, doesn’t matter

21:16.966 --> 21:21.118
if you have connection with others or not. It’s very common.

21:21.319 --> 21:23.109
Because, in the rationality gives them that sense,

21:23.310 --> 21:26.164
"Oh my spirits are all right, my vibrations are all right,

21:26.365 --> 21:28.997
so it is all right if I do not go to puja

21:29.198 --> 21:31.560
or if I do not go to any collective thing

21:31.761 --> 21:34.640
or if I do not support in any collective work

21:34.665 --> 21:38.661
or if I do not take any responsibility of Sahaja Yoga.

21:38.862 --> 21:43.302
Because once you become collective you take responsibilities.

21:43.503 --> 21:47.888
So you are over satisfied with yourself that is good,

21:48.089 --> 21:52.068
that I need not take up any responsibility.

21:52.269 --> 21:55.443
All the Sahaja Yogis are bad, or some of them are bad.

21:55.644 --> 22:00.920
I have nothing to do with them and this is that and that and that.

22:01.121 --> 22:07.300
But in Sahaja Yoga as it is, the Motherhood is universal.

22:08.371 --> 22:16.372
Because if you are the nose, say then somebody is the eye;

22:16.573 --> 22:22.705
if you are the ears, somebody is the lips.

22:23.386 --> 22:28.287
So, it is essential for you to understand

22:28.488 --> 22:35.029
that anybody who is a Sahaja Yogi is in trouble,

22:35.230 --> 22:39.373
you are in trouble. Is threat to your growth;

22:39.574 --> 22:43.090
it is a threat to your growth, because it is the Whole that is growing.

22:43.115 --> 22:45.766
Of course, those who are absolutely useless

22:45.967 --> 22:50.696
will be thrown away, gradually. That’s what Mother does.

22:50.897 --> 22:56.673
They can be thrown away absolutely,

22:56.874 --> 22:59.743
so much far away that they will never return.

22:59.944 --> 23:02.571
But you don’t have to worry about such people,

23:02.772 --> 23:06.657
they will be thrown away. They will be given some chances,

23:06.858 --> 23:12.516
some more credits will be given, some graces will be given,

23:12.717 --> 23:15.446
but ultimately they will be thrown away. So you don’t have to worry.

23:15.647 --> 23:18.055
But you must worry about the Whole.

23:18.256 --> 23:22.227
And you have to take up the responsibility.

23:22.428 --> 23:26.625
Those who do not take up the responsibility

23:26.826 --> 23:32.211
are not the people who are yet matured their child—

23:32.412 --> 23:35.031
that’s the Spirit.

23:35.232 --> 23:38.367
Every type of responsibility that you can take,

23:38.568 --> 23:41.851
think of what responsibilities you can take.

23:42.052 --> 23:44.812
That is why most of us have bad Vishuddhis,

23:45.013 --> 23:47.718
because we do not take the responsibilities,

23:47.919 --> 23:50.765
and whatever responsibility we do take

23:50.966 --> 23:55.249
we have to be much, much, much more responsible

23:55.450 --> 24:00.879
than ordinary government servants are.

24:03.164 --> 24:07.432
Sometimes we hear from one ear and throw it away from the same—

24:07.633 --> 24:11.750
don’t even allow it to come into the head.

24:15.047 --> 24:21.760
So, one has to understand that the child is your responsibility,

24:21.961 --> 24:24.073
you have to look after the child.

24:24.274 --> 24:29.656
And the Whole is also your responsibility.

24:30.907 --> 24:36.808
Now, how to establish the connection between your Spirit,

24:37.009 --> 24:41.691
or keep the connection on between the Spirit and the womb,

24:41.892 --> 24:45.515
or the Kundalini,

24:45.716 --> 24:48.382
is the biggest problem that we all face:

24:48.583 --> 24:51.374
that our connections are very loose

24:51.575 --> 24:58.700
and that’s why this Kundalini cannot look after the Spirit.

24:59.036 --> 25:02.858
I wonder if you have noticed one thing in Sahaja Yoga,

25:03.059 --> 25:08.699
that you can maneuver the Kundalini, but not the Spirit.

25:10.794 --> 25:13.674
You can raise your hand; the Kundalini will move.

25:13.875 --> 25:15.830
You can maneuver it.

25:16.031 --> 25:19.596
You can give it a bandhan, it will go around and round and round.

25:19.797 --> 25:23.299
But what about the Spirit?

25:23.500 --> 25:25.822
You cannot maneuver it.

25:26.023 --> 25:28.824
There is only one mantra to awaken the Spirit,

25:29.025 --> 25:33.238
in the sense that to please him you have to say you are the Spirit.

25:33.439 --> 25:36.581
But you cannot maneuver it. You have to bring in Kundalini

25:36.782 --> 25:40.472
to look after it, you have to take Kundalini there,

25:40.673 --> 25:46.027
to the heart, so that this child

25:46.228 --> 25:50.027
which is the little offspring just now

25:50.228 --> 25:56.837
has to be carefully developed and matured.

25:59.277 --> 26:03.679
So on both the sides, of men or women,

26:03.880 --> 26:09.710
we have to understand, that if you are a man,

26:09.911 --> 26:14.898
and if you are dominating man, it’s all right.

26:15.099 --> 26:17.453
But if you are a woman and if you are dominating,

26:17.654 --> 26:20.641
then it’s a difficult thing for Sahaja Yoga to cure you,

26:20.842 --> 26:23.329
because you have lost your quality of being a woman.

26:23.530 --> 26:26.360
At least you have to be a woman to begin with.

26:26.561 --> 26:29.203
If you are not even a woman, then what can you do with

26:29.404 --> 26:34.341
this third persons who are neither man nor woman?

26:34.943 --> 26:38.114
Now the men, when they are dominating, they have to understand,

26:38.315 --> 26:41.786
that they have to be compassionate.

26:41.987 --> 26:46.075
They have to be kind,

26:46.276 --> 26:52.286
they have to be considerate, but never subservient,

26:52.487 --> 26:56.342
never subservient. This is one should understand,

26:56.543 --> 26:59.725
that you should not be subservient.

26:59.926 --> 27:02.858
Now the women, what they have to be;

27:03.059 --> 27:07.671
is to be great, large, receptive;

27:07.872 --> 27:10.710
receiving

27:10.911 --> 27:14.082
and nourishing all that.

27:15.567 --> 27:19.037
Now the way husbands are told sometimes in this West—

27:19.238 --> 27:22.370
I am shocked.

27:23.441 --> 27:26.740
Wife says this to Mr. X, "X you haven’t done this,

27:26.941 --> 27:29.115
X you haven’t done that. How have you put this?

27:29.316 --> 27:33.224
Do this, do that, do that." It’s not woman’s way of doing it,

27:33.425 --> 27:37.751
it’s absolutely wrong that to do it.

27:37.952 --> 27:41.340
To tell him to do something.

27:41.541 --> 27:45.129
You are becoming a manly, and then we lose completely

27:45.330 --> 27:53.672
that power of giving that nourishment of a woman’s love,

27:53.873 --> 27:56.539
which is the power of a woman,

27:56.740 --> 28:00.469
which women don’t understand. I’ll tell you a simple example;

28:00.670 --> 28:04.484
My own grand daughter. She wants to be an air hostess all the time, she wants.

28:04.685 --> 28:07.062
She says, "You must have also thought of being an air hostess."

28:07.263 --> 28:09.515
I said, "Why? What is so great about air hostess?"

28:09.716 --> 28:15.184
She says, “That’s the only time you can give food to someone.”

28:16.732 --> 28:22.414
You see a natural instinct of a Mother that let me see them eat, you see.

28:22.615 --> 28:27.521
They don’t eat themselves, they want others to eat.

28:28.670 --> 28:32.407
But this is not in the conception of the western women, I tell you.

28:32.608 --> 28:34.345
They can’t understand this.

28:34.546 --> 28:37.540
"Why? I have done this, so why not he does this, this."

28:37.741 --> 28:41.267
It’s your privilege to do these things properly,

28:41.468 --> 28:42.861
in a proper way.

28:43.062 --> 28:46.009
But supposing somebody is a very good mechanic,

28:46.210 --> 28:49.267
the woman will also become a mechanic, "I’ll do the mechanical things".

28:49.468 --> 28:51.462
She is not there for doing mechanical work.

28:51.663 --> 28:57.600
She is there for the mechanics of the emotions.

28:58.686 --> 29:01.055
On the contrary she just does the other way round.

29:01.256 --> 29:03.118
Like a man comes home; she goes on ordering,

29:03.319 --> 29:06.227
"You have to put that right, why did you spoil my carpet?

29:06.428 --> 29:10.641
Why did you do this? Clean it up, get that thing, do that."

29:10.842 --> 29:15.992
All his mechanics of emotions are finished.

29:16.193 --> 29:18.848
Once his mechanics of emotions are finished,

29:19.049 --> 29:22.523
he is useless and you are useless as it is.

29:22.724 --> 29:27.692
And men also should not do their jobs. Let them do their own jobs.

29:28.279 --> 29:33.008
I think this is one of the biggest problems of the West today.

29:33.209 --> 29:39.336
That men are neither men, and women are not women.

29:39.537 --> 29:42.477
I find the quality so horrid,

29:42.678 --> 29:46.102
that I don’t know how to deal with the mixtures.

29:46.303 --> 29:50.797
You must understand this very simple thing in life

29:50.998 --> 29:54.102
that if you are a hybrid stuff,

29:54.303 --> 29:57.797
you can’t have the quality of a Sahaja Yogi.

29:57.998 --> 30:00.961
If you mix it up, it’s a very funny thing, isn’t it?

30:01.162 --> 30:04.809
So a woman must try to be a woman

30:05.010 --> 30:07.332
and a man must try to be a man.

30:07.533 --> 30:14.276
Now see, what is the situation, of a man,

30:14.477 --> 30:23.252
as a masculine effect on the development of consciousness?

30:23.453 --> 30:27.385
So, as the manliness was expressed

30:27.586 --> 30:31.328
we have developed science.

30:32.141 --> 30:35.588
We have developed all this knowledge,

30:35.789 --> 30:39.440
all these things which are outside.

30:39.641 --> 30:42.620
Now everything is ready.

30:42.821 --> 30:45.413
Now the woman has to come up.

30:45.614 --> 30:48.397
I mean, I am saying in the very abstract way; don’t think of woman,

30:48.598 --> 30:50.670
but you can say the feminine.

30:50.871 --> 30:54.748
The feminine nature has to rise now.

30:54.972 --> 30:59.091
Now everything is ready, it has to just spark.

30:59.669 --> 31:03.928
All the chakras are ready, now awaken the Kundalini.

31:04.129 --> 31:09.576
Kundalini is as important as the other chakras are.

31:09.785 --> 31:12.857
So now awaken the Kundalini. Now Kundalini’s behavior

31:13.058 --> 31:15.568
and mode of action is very different

31:15.769 --> 31:20.573
from the mode of action of the chakras.

31:23.920 --> 31:27.475
If the Kundalini becomes the chakras and the chakras become the Kundalini,

31:27.676 --> 31:32.570
how will you manage Sahaja Yoga? But we must assume

31:32.771 --> 31:37.871
our own nature in all dignity and in all pride;

31:38.057 --> 31:41.958
not to feel any way low down. Because a man sits on a horse,

31:42.159 --> 31:45.403
the woman wants to sit on a horse.

31:45.604 --> 31:48.880
What is the need for a woman to sit on a horse,

31:49.081 --> 31:51.771
I can’t understand. Here all the women are sitting on a horse.

31:51.972 --> 31:54.185
They’ll become like horses.

31:54.386 --> 31:58.974
Already I think half of your royal family looks like horses,

31:59.175 --> 32:01.919
don’t they?

32:02.120 --> 32:05.411
I think so. Their faces look like horses.

32:05.612 --> 32:09.072
See, so there is no need for women to do

32:09.097 --> 32:12.489
all the things that man have already done. Say, for example,

32:12.690 --> 32:16.989
there’s one personality of masculine personality that has to come

32:17.190 --> 32:20.606
and do a certain job. Now you’ve done it.

32:20.807 --> 32:23.370
All right now the another personality has to do this job.

32:23.571 --> 32:27.511
Now see the situation of the Divine also.

32:28.525 --> 32:31.388
Now the whole complication comes in that

32:31.413 --> 32:34.306
once a kind of a thing has been done,

32:34.507 --> 32:38.462
the another one that comes wants to do the same.

32:38.663 --> 32:40.782
Do you follow My point?

32:40.983 --> 32:45.850
So the whole energy is completely wasted.

32:46.801 --> 32:49.182
The whole preparation has been made

32:49.207 --> 32:51.920
for this Aquarius age to come in

32:52.297 --> 32:54.764
to bring in the Kundalini upward

32:54.789 --> 32:56.990
and to make the whole work out

32:57.191 --> 32:59.810
in such way that the left and right meet

33:00.011 --> 33:06.193
and you all become ignited enlightened

33:06.394 --> 33:13.529
It was a question of our being sharing the whole job

33:13.730 --> 33:15.545
in a proper understanding

33:15.746 --> 33:17.733
Now see how Mother Earth Herself was created,

33:17.934 --> 33:20.421
it is also a very simple thing

33:20.622 --> 33:28.873
First, the movement of the energy started flowing.

33:29.074 --> 33:32.139
Now this is a combined energy all right?

33:32.340 --> 33:36.748
Then the combined energy went round and round and round like that.

33:36.949 --> 33:41.732
And when it consolidated there was a-this big bang.

33:41.933 --> 33:45.349
When big bang took place—now this is the manly work,

33:45.550 --> 33:47.896
I should say in a way; manly style,

33:48.097 --> 33:51.459
because still the Mother earth is not produced—

33:51.660 --> 33:56.920
so then these little fragments again went round and round.

33:57.121 --> 33:59.217
With the momentum, they became roundish.

33:59.418 --> 34:02.561
Out of them the Mother Earth was selected for one job.

34:02.762 --> 34:05.358
Not to do anything - you keep quiet now.

34:05.559 --> 34:13.334
Alright. On the Mother Earth out of the water came the life—

34:13.535 --> 34:16.272
the carbon came in.

34:16.473 --> 34:20.592
Everybody helped there and a human being was created.

34:20.793 --> 34:23.869
Then the men went round, to improve their societies

34:24.070 --> 34:26.525
and whatever they have done to it, whatever was possible

34:26.726 --> 34:29.414
with their ego is done, finished now.

34:29.615 --> 34:34.899
Now they have done their job, you see. Now they are on dole,

34:35.100 --> 34:37.352
you can say.

34:37.553 --> 34:42.399
Now the womb, or we can say the Kundalini

34:42.600 --> 34:45.235
which has been waiting all these years, was resting,

34:45.436 --> 34:47.868
waiting for that time, isn’t it? So we call it:

34:48.069 --> 34:50.220
"the blossom time has now come".

34:50.421 --> 34:56.392
At that time the Kundalini has to rise and ignite,

34:56.593 --> 35:00.945
in such a way that the completion of the whole work takes place—

35:01.146 --> 35:05.200
it is simple. Do you understand now?

35:05.834 --> 35:10.235
So there’s no competition between men or women,

35:10.436 --> 35:14.227
but the style of work is different.

35:14.428 --> 35:18.719
If you understand that, then only this kind of revolution

35:18.920 --> 35:21.219
will take place and not turn out a rebellion.

35:21.420 --> 35:24.453
Actually women are rebelling against men, and a nonsense it is.

35:24.654 --> 35:28.070
It is such a headache, that you create something,

35:28.271 --> 35:30.912
allow them to grow, and the another party comes

35:31.113 --> 35:35.193
which has to complete the job starts rebelling.

35:35.394 --> 35:39.354
So the revolution has to take place and this revolution is only possible

35:39.555 --> 35:46.242
when we understand that what part is left out now to be done.

35:48.567 --> 35:51.655
Are you getting Me all right?

35:51.856 --> 35:55.803
So that part is now Realization,

35:56.004 --> 35:59.326
our awakening of the Kundalini.

35:59.527 --> 36:04.795
For that your feminine qualities are going to help you,

36:04.996 --> 36:07.349
not your masculine qualities.

36:07.550 --> 36:11.029
So aggressiveness must be given up by men.

36:11.230 --> 36:13.482
Also, because they are Sahaja Yogis now,

36:13.683 --> 36:16.654
they have to take feminine qualities. Not of fighting.

36:16.855 --> 36:19.545
If women fight they are not women.

36:19.746 --> 36:22.850
You see, women are told that

36:23.051 --> 36:29.702
"you are useless, you are good for nothing",

36:29.903 --> 36:34.350
so now they are trying to show, ‘no’, we are also all right.

36:34.551 --> 36:39.457
If you have eaten one crow we will eat three."

36:41.417 --> 36:52.761
Now, this understanding and the wise perception would be such that

36:52.962 --> 36:55.988
"what do we have to do now to change the mode

36:56.189 --> 36:58.519
and the style of our lives?"

36:58.720 --> 37:01.222
What’s wrong here?

37:01.423 --> 37:03.613
A turning point has come.

37:03.814 --> 37:10.769
Now the evolution is not rebellion, at all by any chance.

37:10.970 --> 37:14.566
It’s a wrong idea people have. It’s not rebellion,

37:14.767 --> 37:17.099
that you hit me and I hit you—go on hitting each other,

37:17.300 --> 37:19.982
like a pendulum you move; you see the movement of a pendulum.

37:20.183 --> 37:23.755
It’s not like a boom, this thing—that today you are born as a Muslim,

37:23.956 --> 37:26.496
tomorrow you are born as a Jew, then you are born as a Jew,

37:26.697 --> 37:28.871
then you are born as a Hindu, then you are born as—

37:29.072 --> 37:33.184
it’s not pendulum. It is spiral movement.

37:33.385 --> 37:38.043
So every time you achieve an evolution

37:38.244 --> 37:40.231
you are at a higher level than before.

37:40.432 --> 37:44.309
So the movement is spiral—see My point?

37:44.510 --> 37:51.590
Now to achieve the higher position in our whole being

37:51.791 --> 37:53.746
what should we do?

37:53.947 --> 37:57.637
Is to understand that from this point to that point we have to rise—

37:57.838 --> 38:05.714
we have to rise in a way that we move in such a way

38:05.915 --> 38:14.122
that it is not in a pendulum way but in a spiral way.

38:14.506 --> 38:21.485
And to move spirally, you have to use another kind of force.

38:21.686 --> 38:26.305
Whatever you have used so far has to be endowed

38:26.506 --> 38:28.300
with another kind of force

38:28.501 --> 38:31.308
and that’s the feminine qualities of women.

38:31.509 --> 38:34.894
But where are the feminine women?

38:35.095 --> 38:39.050
They dress up like women, they will try to be feminine

38:39.251 --> 38:43.519
and all that. That’s not the way. From inside, from the heart.

38:43.720 --> 38:49.386
A feminine heart. Christ showed that in His life—

38:49.587 --> 38:52.972
He forgave. Only a woman can forgive, man cannot,

38:53.173 --> 38:56.863
because he is aggressive. How can he forgive?

38:57.064 --> 39:00.886
Krishna never forgave anyone. He used to kill.

39:01.087 --> 39:08.540
Right royal fashion, go, all right? if you are so, all right. Done.

39:08.997 --> 39:12.007
He forgave to such an extent to show that

39:12.208 --> 39:16.890
He is now giving a turn to the spiral

39:17.091 --> 39:22.023
and now a feminine quality has to be developed among human beings.

39:22.224 --> 39:25.211
But that doesn’t mean that you start walking like women

39:25.412 --> 39:30.162
or developing waistlines.

39:32.662 --> 39:35.727
Because that’s another stupidity.

39:35.928 --> 39:39.227
But to be Motherly.

39:39.428 --> 39:43.383
Not to be fatherly, but to be Motherly.

39:43.584 --> 39:47.188
That kindness, that gentleness

39:47.389 --> 39:51.258
should be in your behavior towards each other.

39:51.459 --> 39:55.774
Of course this force also corrects, sometimes also gets angry also.

39:55.975 --> 39:58.540
Mother also has to get angry sometimes,

39:58.741 --> 40:02.298
especially with people who never get all right with their behavior,

40:02.499 --> 40:04.837
She has to be shouting, punishing,

40:05.038 --> 40:09.321
and sometimes She also destroys; it’s all right.

40:09.522 --> 40:14.397
But that is sometimes, not all the time.

40:15.350 --> 40:20.766
So just now one has to accept that to be like the Mother Earth

40:20.967 --> 40:24.282
we have to be forbearing—Dhara.

40:24.483 --> 40:29.509
Daharaitey sadara. She is the sustenance of everything.

40:29.710 --> 40:34.665
She takes everything, the vibrations are sucked in; see, talk about it.

40:34.866 --> 40:37.431
And now for the first time after Realization,

40:37.632 --> 40:42.251
you can give Her back what you have got it, from Her.

40:42.452 --> 40:44.695
You can give vibrations to Her trees that are created, y

40:44.896 --> 40:49.708
ou can make them beautiful. You can transform a flower

40:49.936 --> 40:53.001
into a more beautiful flower.

40:53.202 --> 40:55.587
Now whatever you have got from the Mother Earth

40:55.788 --> 41:00.767
you can give because your Mother Earth is awakened within you now.

41:00.968 --> 41:01.968
So you return Her back everything that you got from Her

41:04.261 --> 41:08.826
and give it to others. Generosity, the greatness of heart,

41:09.027 --> 41:16.006
nobility, forgiveness, love, affection, bearing everything for love.

41:16.207 --> 41:20.467
And for the mother, to save her child, she’ll starve herself,

41:20.668 --> 41:24.303
she’ll do everything to save her child,

41:24.504 --> 41:28.287
complete dedication she has for her child.

41:28.488 --> 41:31.874
That’s a real mother—I mean the kind of mothers you see these days,

41:32.075 --> 41:34.818
neither they are mothers nor women. But what I am saying,

41:35.019 --> 41:41.050
that’s the real image of a mother, and you have a image before you.

41:43.130 --> 41:46.387
So, this is what one has to develop now,

41:46.588 --> 41:49.371
whether you are men or women as Sahaja Yogis

41:49.572 --> 41:53.551
you must develop a new consciousness of affection,

41:53.752 --> 41:56.676
love and compassion.

41:56.877 --> 42:01.481
Getting angry, getting into a temper, shouting at people,

42:01.682 --> 42:06.137
screaming at people—is not going to help you much.

42:06.338 --> 42:08.926
If you have to help the whole, the growth of the whole,

42:09.127 --> 42:13.434
try to make yourself a milder person—

42:13.635 --> 42:16.707
be angry with yourself that you are losing tempers

42:16.908 --> 42:21.387
and you are so unkind to others.

42:21.588 --> 42:26.278
All the problems have come out of the over-growth of the masculinity—

42:26.479 --> 42:28.841
over-growth. It reaches a certain point, you see,

42:29.042 --> 42:34.346
it’s reached such a wretched point now, that it has to come down.

42:37.620 --> 42:42.046
But also femininity, at a lower level, without Realization

42:42.247 --> 42:46.819
could be very, very small hearted, chicken hearted,

42:47.020 --> 42:51.645
could be all the time worried about her own child.

42:52.043 --> 42:55.600
That’s what one has to change—

42:55.801 --> 43:00.663
is to have love and affection for every Sahaja Yogi,

43:00.864 --> 43:04.338
for every person. When it comes to fighting others

43:04.539 --> 43:08.940
you are all one but among yourselves you can look after each other,

43:09.141 --> 43:12.534
tell them—say for example, something is paining in my nose here,

43:12.735 --> 43:15.292
I will just try to rub it in the same way.

43:15.493 --> 43:20.698
But I won’t try to cut my nose will I? Or bang my nose, I won’t?

43:20.899 --> 43:25.843
So the feeling that the other is myself; be kind and gentle—

43:26.044 --> 43:29.374
try to improve and help in that manner.

43:29.575 --> 43:32.140
I hope you have understood the whole thing.

43:32.341 --> 43:36.029
In a nutshell is that: we have to change the whole mode—

43:36.230 --> 43:41.131
a radical change has to come in the society of Sahaja Yogis.

43:41.332 --> 43:46.613
Now, if there is any question you ask Me, before we start the puja.

43:48.832 --> 43:53.823
Now the problem of divorce and all that, you can see this respect.

44:04.931 --> 44:10.188
Left Nabhi problem, we can talk to.

44:37.687 --> 44:40.988
What is it?

44:46.282 --> 44:48.602
See.

44:50.180 --> 44:55.292
This problem comes in where you are not the whole.

44:55.493 --> 44:57.292
All right?

44:57.493 --> 45:01.440
Now supposing, as I told you, if you are the whole,

45:01.641 --> 45:05.391
then who is the other?

45:06.594 --> 45:09.666
Then you will, even if you have to hurt. Say, for example,

45:09.867 --> 45:13.854
if there is blood coming out of my thumb,

45:14.055 --> 45:18.260
I press it hard to stop the blood. It will hurt the thumb, thing.

45:18.461 --> 45:21.462
But the discrimination must be used, that I'm loosing my blood

45:21.663 --> 45:23.961
which is precious, much more precious than this finger

45:24.162 --> 45:27.380
it will hurt.

45:28.904 --> 45:30.937
But that discretion must be achieved, you see.

45:31.138 --> 45:33.031
In Sahaja Yoga, you're all free to develop

45:33.232 --> 45:35.203
your sense of discretion.

45:35.404 --> 45:37.292
And once you develop your sense of discretion,

45:37.493 --> 45:39.847
gradually you will know what to do. In the beginning you will hurt,

45:40.048 --> 45:42.488
no doubt, because you are used to that.

45:42.689 --> 45:45.105
I've seen people here, just barking at each other,

45:45.306 --> 45:48.300
as soon as they see each other they start barking.

45:48.501 --> 45:50.691
You go anywhere in the whole country you go anywhere,

45:50.892 --> 45:52.910
they start barking for nothing at all. I was surprised.

45:53.111 --> 45:54.332
In a school, I went there,

45:54.533 --> 45:56.777
there also everybody is barking at each other, you know.

45:56.978 --> 45:59.582
Whether they are drunk or not drunk, makes no difference-

45:59.783 --> 46:04.425
is the same state. But after Realization, you do say.

46:04.626 --> 46:09.269
Because you feel concerned, you're worried.

46:09.470 --> 46:14.308
But you say in such a way that you achieve the result.

46:14.509 --> 46:17.347
See My point is-that is the criteria:

46:17.548 --> 46:21.407
that you should achieve the results.

46:22.251 --> 46:24.652
But, supposing a man has come for the first time, and tell him

46:24.853 --> 46:27.386
that "you are a bhoot",

46:27.587 --> 46:31.714
then naturally he will be hurt;

46:31.915 --> 46:35.415
very common.

46:37.337 --> 46:40.730
First day, somebody walks in and you say "you are a bhoot".

46:40.931 --> 46:42.764
I mean, thank God if he doesn't understand the meaning

46:42.965 --> 46:47.300
of the word bhoot -then it's all right.

46:51.268 --> 46:56.395
But first you think of being gentle, nice,

46:56.596 --> 47:01.653
embalming, sweet. Let's see, find out ways and methods;

47:01.854 --> 47:04.755
there's a very good way-in the evening, to write down

47:04.956 --> 47:09.323
"how many sweet things I've said today."

47:14.401 --> 47:16.708
Not like this, sweet things we say,

47:16.909 --> 47:20.028
"You're looking beautiful" all that.

47:20.229 --> 47:25.260
Not the superficial ones. That may pamper the ego.

47:25.596 --> 47:28.567
But they're so sweet you know, things are.

47:28.768 --> 47:35.114
Let's say

47:35.315 --> 47:37.934
there are some very good words,

47:38.135 --> 47:42.486
you can say, like-"Are you warm enough?"

47:43.190 --> 47:47.184
-very sweet way of asking a question. Then, it's very simple;

47:47.385 --> 47:49.144
but you can say like that.

47:49.345 --> 47:52.839
Just-it's very difficult for people to say that even, I've seen.

47:53.040 --> 47:56.386
Looking after others comforts. Somebody is sitting, he wants water.

47:56.587 --> 48:00.330
Awkwardly sitting. You just go rush and given him water.

48:00.531 --> 48:06.190
Oh that's too much to expect. That, Oh God you gave water,

48:06.391 --> 48:10.393
"I'm not his servant"-immediately the question comes into the head.

48:10.594 --> 48:14.557
Little bit trying to do something here and there.

48:14.758 --> 48:19.440
Or sometimes thinking-going in the market,

48:19.641 --> 48:23.174
you find something. "Oh let me take it for him".

48:23.375 --> 48:25.507
Children do. I've seen children all the time;

48:25.708 --> 48:32.583
they think of their friends-what they can buy for others.

48:34.775 --> 48:36.824
"This is good for my friend, this is good for..."

48:37.025 --> 48:38.660
She's very fond of things, she "likes. . ."

48:38.861 --> 48:41.207
All these little-little things, you know.

48:41.408 --> 48:43.340
Sometimes even a small thing

48:43.541 --> 48:44.942
like; early in the morning you get up,

48:45.143 --> 48:47.677
you find the another person is sleeping on one side,

48:47.878 --> 48:52.505
his blanket on the third side and his pillow in the fourth side.

48:52.706 --> 48:54.464
So you just put his head on the pillow

48:54.665 --> 48:58.956
and cover him with the blanket. That's mother's job.

49:02.299 --> 49:07.252
Not out of fear, but out of sheer love.

49:09.226 --> 49:12.017
Like even if it is cold and buttons are open,

49:12.218 --> 49:16.431
you can button up a person you like. Little-little things you know.

49:16.632 --> 49:19.244
Women have very little-sweet things which they do,

49:19.445 --> 49:25.359
which makes men very happy. But women have lost now, that sense.

49:29.839 --> 49:32.003
Not the fighting, but thinking of

49:32.204 --> 49:34.511
what sweet things you can do for him.

49:34.712 --> 49:38.844
And also, sometimes teasing is all right.

49:40.446 --> 49:43.815
Sometimes tickling is all right.

49:44.016 --> 49:50.307
But a kind of a sweet you see rapport between each other;

49:50.508 --> 49:56.281
even the feeling, that we can do that. It's a master's job.

49:56.985 --> 49:59.943
Is a master's job. The one who is a master can do it,

50:00.144 --> 50:02.290
those who are not, will not be able to.

50:02.491 --> 50:06.031
They'll again come back to hurt. Ultimately, they'll land up

50:06.056 --> 50:09.115
with hurting or biting or coming to blows.

50:09.140 --> 50:12.088
But those who are masters will be so beautifully doing

50:12.289 --> 50:18.158
the whole job that you see a kind of a very sweet relationship-

50:18.359 --> 50:21.044
it's called Madhurya. Without any lust,

50:21.069 --> 50:24.980
without any money-business, anything. Such sweet relationships.

50:25.181 --> 50:29.485
And the joy would be bubbling.

50:30.634 --> 50:33.363
All these perversions, all these things will drop off.

50:33.564 --> 50:38.064
But a very sweet relationship-

50:43.142 --> 50:49.009
all right? Even saying that, you are feeling happy.
