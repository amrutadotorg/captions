00:00:08.024 --> 00:00:15.854
Today, we have to know something about the connection

00:00:16.055 --> 00:00:20.713
of Sahaja Yoga with this Mother Earth.

00:00:20.914 --> 00:00:22.713
It is very important,

00:00:22.914 --> 00:00:28.023
that we must understand the value of the Mother Earth.

00:00:28.922 --> 00:00:30.877
She has been very kind to all of you,

00:00:31.078 --> 00:00:33.674
She has been sucking your vibrations.

00:00:33.875 --> 00:00:36.554
She has been, otherwise also,

00:00:36.755 --> 00:00:41.874
She has given you everything that you see around.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:49.397
So today, we have to understand the connection,

00:00:49.598 --> 00:00:54.920
and the symbolic expression of the Mother Earth within ourselves.

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:58.764
I have told you before also that

00:00:58.965 --> 00:01:02.366
Kundalini, which is in three and a half coils

00:01:02.567 --> 00:01:09.348
is placed within a triangular bone.

00:01:09.684 --> 00:01:16.342
Now this abode of the Kundalini is called as Mooladhara,

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:23.764
and is represented in the universe as this Mother Earth.

00:01:25.801 --> 00:01:28.819
Or in the puja, it is represented as the Kumbha.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.020
I don’t know if you have made the Kumbha or not? Have you?

00:01:32.221 --> 00:01:36.746
Yes. The Kumbha is it here.

00:01:44.467 --> 00:01:50.875
So far, in the movement of our consciousness,

00:01:51.076 --> 00:02:00.499
we have been trying to understand the God Almighty

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.562
and all other five elements that we call as important.

00:02:17.652 --> 00:02:21.911
And also,

00:02:22.112 --> 00:02:25.864
the consciousness has been moving

00:02:26.065 --> 00:02:32.481
towards the understanding of

00:02:32.682 --> 00:02:38.291
all the other four elements but the Mother Earth.

00:02:40.096 --> 00:02:43.536
That had to be such, because unless and until

00:02:43.737 --> 00:02:49.270
the understanding of all these four other elements

00:02:49.471 --> 00:02:52.801
are brought to a certain degree,

00:02:53.002 --> 00:02:55.707
the Mother Earth cannot express itself.

00:02:55.908 --> 00:03:00.262
Like if all your chakras, four chakras, are caught up,

00:03:00.463 --> 00:03:03.246
you cannot raise the Kundalini,

00:03:03.447 --> 00:03:06.238
you cannot give Self-Realization.

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:10.652
You cannot have a mass evolutionary process done.

00:03:10.853 --> 00:03:15.261
That’s why we had yagyas,

00:03:15.462 --> 00:03:20.870
all other methods of exciting the four elements.

00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:23.893
They worshipped the water

00:03:24.094 --> 00:03:30.922
and they worshipped air, the sky, the firmament, the light.

00:03:33.627 --> 00:03:36.945
And that’s how they came up to the time of Christ

00:03:37.146 --> 00:03:42.356
where light was worshipped.

00:03:44.373 --> 00:03:50.008
But today when we are in this modern Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.321
we are actually at the level of the Mother Earth,

00:03:53.522 --> 00:03:56.110
because this is the age of the Aquarius.

00:03:56.311 --> 00:04:00.977
And Aquarius is the same as the Kumbha—

00:04:01.178 --> 00:04:03.852
is the Mother Earth.

00:04:04.053 --> 00:04:09.021
So we are at the level of the Mother Earth.

00:04:10.186 --> 00:04:15.313
You can also see in the consciousness of human beings;

00:04:15.514 --> 00:04:19.532
I’m saying not only men, but women also and men.

00:04:19.733 --> 00:04:22.962
The consciousness is moving more towards

00:04:23.163 --> 00:04:28.564
the feminine expression of life.

00:04:28.765 --> 00:04:31.212
But as stupid as human beings are,

00:04:31.413 --> 00:04:35.470
the feminists also have been very stupid,

00:04:35.671 --> 00:04:40.403
that they are fighting on the level of rationality,

00:04:40.604 --> 00:04:45.239
of economics, of politics—all useless things.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.356
Equality on all these things if they are to be sought,

00:04:48.557 --> 00:04:52.614
you become men, you just become like men.

00:04:52.815 --> 00:04:55.421
If you are argumentative, if you are rational,

00:04:55.622 --> 00:04:59.741
if you talk like man, it’s a masculine development.

00:04:59.942 --> 00:05:03.062
But the Mothers development, the feminine development,

00:05:03.263 --> 00:05:08.351
is not equality in the way the men have been stupid.

00:05:08.552 --> 00:05:11.273
No use competing with men in their stupidity,

00:05:11.474 --> 00:05:14.240
the amount of stupidity has been created already for us

00:05:14.441 --> 00:05:16.842
quite sufficiently.

00:05:17.043 --> 00:05:20.733
The whole world is today, is expressing that nonsense

00:05:20.934 --> 00:05:25.866
that they have—the competition, the aggression, the oppression.

00:05:26.067 --> 00:05:29.264
So the other side of the woman, which was called as the

00:05:29.465 --> 00:05:34.794
dominated one, the dark side, the oppressed and all that

00:05:34.995 --> 00:05:37.424
has to express itself in a different way.

00:05:37.625 --> 00:05:41.768
The whole mode, the style, has to change.

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:44.635
See now, in Christianity one should understand;

00:05:44.836 --> 00:05:47.658
why Christianity, even Judaism, any religion,

00:05:47.859 --> 00:05:51.150
even Hinduism and all that

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:54.101
but its more in Christianity, surprisingly

00:05:54.302 --> 00:06:00.476
they just had no place for Mary.

00:06:00.677 --> 00:06:06.617
And Muslims even crowned it by completely canceling Fatima.

00:06:06.818 --> 00:06:12.515
And on top of that,

00:06:12.716 --> 00:06:16.999
you will see that among Christians, I think that ordination,

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.782
or what you call that, is not given to the lady to women,

00:06:20.983 --> 00:06:26.061
while Christ was not born of a man.

00:06:27.811 --> 00:06:31.227
But that does not in any way mean that you compete men

00:06:31.428 --> 00:06:36.792
in their foolish enterprises by which they have practically

00:06:36.993 --> 00:06:40.597
brought this world to such a ruinous state.

00:06:40.798 --> 00:06:46.824
So today we have to understand that it is the time for

00:06:47.025 --> 00:06:50.680
the motherly qualities to develop. Even a man,

00:06:50.881 --> 00:06:54.274
when he becomes motherly only, becomes a great man.

00:06:54.475 --> 00:07:01.360
Like Christ, when he had compassion, he was called as a saint.

00:07:01.561 --> 00:07:06.008
So the quality of a woman as a Mother—

00:07:06.209 --> 00:07:09.594
Goddess is always as a Mother—

00:07:09.795 --> 00:07:13.908
and She is the power most important to ignite Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:14.109 --> 00:07:17.002
Now how She ignites, I’ll tell you.

00:07:17.203 --> 00:07:20.611
I’ll give an analogy, but analogy should not be carried too far—

00:07:20.812 --> 00:07:25.213
as wise Sahaja Yogis you should not carry it too far.

00:07:25.414 --> 00:07:28.557
Say there is a zero, it has no meaning.

00:07:28.758 --> 00:07:32.284
In the same way God Almighty has no meaning,

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:37.284
till you put some sort of one or two before it.

00:07:37.485 --> 00:07:40.331
It’s a zero. It has an existence

00:07:40.532 --> 00:07:44.831
but it has no capacity or a power to express itself.

00:07:45.032 --> 00:07:46.425
So it’s a zero.

00:07:46.626 --> 00:07:51.113
Like that we should say the masculine growth is a zero.

00:07:51.314 --> 00:07:53.863
Another analogy I will give you to understand it.

00:07:54.064 --> 00:07:59.301
That if you see

00:07:59.502 --> 00:08:05.504
very high power wires, going over your heads,

00:08:05.705 --> 00:08:09.304
they are absolutely harmless, there’s no trouble.

00:08:09.505 --> 00:08:13.365
In Delhi there was a suggestion that there is a very big plot of

00:08:13.566 --> 00:08:18.655
available where there are high power wires are going

00:08:18.856 --> 00:08:22.999
and we can have it for free. I asked "What is the problem?"

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.717
They said only, if earth gets connected with that

00:08:26.918 --> 00:08:30.342
then you will have problem.

00:08:30.543 --> 00:08:33.932
So till these-this high power thing, whatever it is—

00:08:34.133 --> 00:08:38.612
is not connected with the earth, it has no meaning at all.

00:08:38.813 --> 00:08:44.105
But earth is very different from this dynamic power

00:08:44.306 --> 00:08:49.855
that is flowing through those wires, which are zero,

00:08:50.056 --> 00:08:53.337
which mean nothing.

00:08:54.204 --> 00:08:57.401
In the same way, in a woman,

00:08:57.602 --> 00:09:03.117
the womb of a woman is the Kundalini.

00:09:03.563 --> 00:09:07.175
Now what is a womb? Now, if that is the Kundalini,

00:09:07.376 --> 00:09:09.800
that expresses the Kundalini in the gross;

00:09:10.001 --> 00:09:14.214
that means the Mother Earth is also like the womb.

00:09:14.415 --> 00:09:17.722
Now what does a womb do?

00:09:17.923 --> 00:09:22.542
It receives the sperm,

00:09:22.743 --> 00:09:26.760
which is just a frivolous act of man

00:09:26.961 --> 00:09:30.244
or you can say just an aggression,

00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:34.213
and she then nourishes -

00:09:34.414 --> 00:09:38.752
looks after it, corrects it

00:09:38.953 --> 00:09:43.299
and allows it to grow, not in an aggressive way

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.752
but in a very compassionate and a sensible way,

00:09:47.953 --> 00:09:54.171
till it is expelled out of the womb when it is grown up.

00:09:55.453 --> 00:09:59.752
So the idea of womb is that the expression has to be

00:09:59.953 --> 00:10:05.190
in such a manner that it does not dominate.

00:10:05.391 --> 00:10:09.362
It does not dominate the embryo.

00:10:09.563 --> 00:10:12.003
If it dominates, how can it grow?

00:10:12.204 --> 00:10:16.011
So it nourishes it and makes it grow.

00:10:16.212 --> 00:10:18.706
This is what today’s Sahaja Yoga is.

00:10:18.907 --> 00:10:21.987
That now the Mother Earth is the one,

00:10:22.188 --> 00:10:27.378
who is symbolized within you as the Mooladhara,

00:10:27.579 --> 00:10:31.292
as symbolized as the AdiShakti here-

00:10:31.493 --> 00:10:35.097
is sitting down before you to nourish you,

00:10:35.298 --> 00:10:38.269
to make you grow into new personalities—

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:42.102
into mature personalities.

00:10:43.423 --> 00:10:47.524
This concept we must understand.

00:10:48.118 --> 00:10:50.886
So the women of the West must understand

00:10:51.087 --> 00:10:53.630
that the nonsensical ideas they have taken from men

00:10:53.831 --> 00:10:59.075
must be completely discarded. They have to become women first.

00:10:59.276 --> 00:11:02.864
Those women who just are talking like men,

00:11:03.065 --> 00:11:06.841
can never help in Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:12.263
They have to be like this Mother Earth who allows you

00:11:12.464 --> 00:11:14.716
to do what you like with Her.

00:11:14.917 --> 00:11:17.553
I mean you human beings have been so stupid

00:11:17.754 --> 00:11:20.483
to exploit Her to the maximum,

00:11:20.684 --> 00:11:26.075
not onlyt hat but also She

00:11:26.276 --> 00:11:29.232
bears lot of nonsense upon Herself.

00:11:29.433 --> 00:11:33.912
But then a time reaches where She becomes explosive,

00:11:34.113 --> 00:11:39.170
then She starts consuming people inside Herself.

00:11:39.371 --> 00:11:42.350
And when She is consuming people

00:11:42.551 --> 00:11:46.608
then you see the earthquakes and droughts and this and that,

00:11:46.809 --> 00:11:51.663
all these things start coming in and people get engulfed

00:11:51.864 --> 00:11:56.538
into these problems

00:11:56.739 --> 00:12:01.324
which they blame Mother Earth for that.

00:12:07.609 --> 00:12:10.541
The problems that human beings have created

00:12:10.742 --> 00:12:15.549
out of aggressive nature—even aggression towards the Mother Earth,

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:20.377
they have to pay dividend for that. And they are paying.

00:12:20.578 --> 00:12:24.572
Now, to stop this kind of a movement of aggressiveness

00:12:24.773 --> 00:12:27.416
which brings all kinds of disturbances,

00:12:27.617 --> 00:12:31.549
one has to recede back and should develop

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:36.463
the sense of totality, of compassion.

00:12:36.664 --> 00:12:41.065
Unless and until, you understand totality,

00:12:41.266 --> 00:12:43.393
the total, the complete, the whole—

00:12:43.594 --> 00:12:48.721
that’s the womb that’s your Mother.

00:12:48.922 --> 00:12:51.916
As long as you try to be individualistic

00:12:52.117 --> 00:12:56.611
you cannot be a good Sahaja Yogi.

00:12:56.812 --> 00:13:01.119
You have to become one with the whole.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.865
Now we have to face ourselves for that, very important it is.

00:13:05.066 --> 00:13:08.545
Specially in the west, I would say we have to face ourselves

00:13:08.746 --> 00:13:11.733
very clearly—what are we up to?

00:13:11.934 --> 00:13:15.863
That’s a very important thing.

00:13:17.926 --> 00:13:22.863
First of all let us see where is our attention.

00:13:23.551 --> 00:13:28.811
Ask a question. We are Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yogis

00:13:29.012 --> 00:13:33.475
within our fold

00:13:33.676 --> 00:13:38.733
and I am sometimes surprised that even now,

00:13:38.934 --> 00:13:43.121
the attention can be very funny.

00:13:44.981 --> 00:13:48.241
Like, simple thing, like we can have attention

00:13:48.442 --> 00:13:52.098
on material things:

00:13:53.458 --> 00:13:58.593
"this is mine-this is yours;

00:13:58.794 --> 00:14:01.835
that I should have my privacy." Then you are gone into

00:14:02.036 --> 00:14:05.741
the another realm of aggressiveness.

00:14:05.942 --> 00:14:08.061
If you try to have your own privacy,

00:14:08.262 --> 00:14:15.769
then you are depriving others of their privacy.

00:14:16.308 --> 00:14:19.680
It was all right when you were not Sahaja Yogis,

00:14:19.881 --> 00:14:22.227
to have your privacy, because you had to grow

00:14:22.428 --> 00:14:26.758
in your privacy at that time. But after Sahaja Yoga

00:14:26.959 --> 00:14:33.899
you have to become one with everyone else—

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:37.235
that is very important. Before Sahaja Yoga

00:14:37.436 --> 00:14:43.118
you were different and after Sahaja Yoga you are different.

00:14:43.319 --> 00:14:48.259
The whole concept must change after Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.392
That now you have become one with the whole

00:14:51.593 --> 00:14:54.697
and to feel that you are one with the whole,

00:14:54.898 --> 00:15:00.111
you should try to give up all your individualistic attitudes.

00:15:00.312 --> 00:15:07.330
That’s very common now to hear "Yes, I like this, I like that."

00:15:08.858 --> 00:15:12.463
It’s very common: "I like it." Very common.

00:15:12.664 --> 00:15:17.960
But doesn’t behove a Sahaja Yogi to say such a thing.

00:15:19.031 --> 00:15:24.072
You see, how can I say that I like some thing?

00:15:24.273 --> 00:15:29.588
Think of a mother who has to bear the child,

00:15:29.789 --> 00:15:34.822
has to give birth to a child, has to look after the child,

00:15:35.023 --> 00:15:39.197
the needs of the child, protect the child,

00:15:39.398 --> 00:15:41.603
train the child. How can she say:

00:15:41.804 --> 00:15:46.108
"I like this" and "I like that"! Where is the time?

00:15:46.578 --> 00:15:49.697
To think what you like and what you don’t like,

00:15:49.898 --> 00:15:55.244
"I like this food, I like that food". Where is the time?

00:15:55.445 --> 00:15:58.744
Where is the energy left for that? Where is the attention?

00:15:58.945 --> 00:16:05.463
The attention is on the upbringing of the child.

00:16:05.664 --> 00:16:11.244
Now in the same way a Sahaja Yogi must know that

00:16:11.445 --> 00:16:16.517
the child within him is born—

00:16:16.718 --> 00:16:19.080
the Spirit.

00:16:19.281 --> 00:16:22.908
Spirit is the child

00:16:23.109 --> 00:16:25.728
which has been born within him,

00:16:25.929 --> 00:16:30.884
now he has to nourish, through the Kundalini.

00:16:31.085 --> 00:16:35.181
He has to water it, he has to look after it.

00:16:35.382 --> 00:16:38.884
It has to make it grow. Now where is the time

00:16:39.085 --> 00:16:42.173
for other nonsensical things? You have a child in hand.

00:16:42.374 --> 00:16:47.517
You are all mothers looking after your child—that’s your Spirit.

00:16:47.718 --> 00:16:51.509
So where do you have time for all these things?

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:53.478
What attention should be:

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:56.861
"What can I do to make this child happy,

00:16:57.062 --> 00:17:01.080
to make this child grow, to make this child

00:17:01.281 --> 00:17:03.932
completely manifest my self."

00:17:04.133 --> 00:17:07.471
The mother replaces herself

00:17:07.672 --> 00:17:11.416
as soon as the child becomes a mature child.

00:17:11.617 --> 00:17:13.971
So now in you, the Motherhood

00:17:14.172 --> 00:17:18.159
must take over than the Fatherhood.

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.518
Motherhood towards yourself. The attitude should be

00:17:21.719 --> 00:17:24.354
like a Mother towards the child.

00:17:24.555 --> 00:17:27.018
How her attention is towards the child?

00:17:27.219 --> 00:17:32.057
You can see in every day-to-day life how we behave.

00:17:32.258 --> 00:17:36.784
I have seen people very much interested even now, in food.

00:17:36.985 --> 00:17:39.495
I mean, where is the time? Where is the attention?

00:17:39.696 --> 00:17:42.433
How can you be so much worried about your food?

00:17:42.634 --> 00:17:45.503
Worried about your sleep. Worried about your health;

00:17:45.704 --> 00:17:49.737
worried about this-that? I mean, here you are to worry about your child

00:17:49.938 --> 00:17:52.268
which you have got now within.

00:17:52.469 --> 00:17:56.015
And that’s why the child is neglected and sometimes you find

00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:01.055
the child becomes sick or sometimes goes into a coma

00:18:01.256 --> 00:18:04.844
or may die away also.

00:18:05.045 --> 00:18:09.055
So the situation is very different now for Sahaja Yogis:

00:18:09.256 --> 00:18:13.313
"how to treat themselves?"

00:18:13.514 --> 00:18:16.454
Those who are running after still food

00:18:16.655 --> 00:18:19.665
and all these nonsensical things. I mean have seen Sahaja Yogis,

00:18:19.866 --> 00:18:24.412
all their attention is on food all the time.

00:18:25.155 --> 00:18:27.673
How dedication can come in a person

00:18:27.874 --> 00:18:33.233
who is so much dedicated to food habits?

00:18:33.874 --> 00:18:38.165
Like, we have seen,

00:18:38.366 --> 00:18:41.774
you might have also seen—some of you—Ajanta caves were built.

00:18:41.975 --> 00:18:45.563
In ten generations they built Ajanta caves,

00:18:45.764 --> 00:18:49.969
ten generations! And

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:54.578
they built it in a place where there was not even water available—

00:18:54.779 --> 00:18:57.586
to begin with.

00:18:57.787 --> 00:19:00.680
And day in and day out thousands of people,

00:19:00.881 --> 00:19:05.219
without getting any payment, without getting anything, built it.

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.321
No food—no question!

00:19:07.522 --> 00:19:10.477
They used to eat some fruits somewhere here, there,

00:19:10.678 --> 00:19:15.420
but their dedication gave them power to do it.

00:19:16.858 --> 00:19:19.532
But this dedication can only be developed

00:19:19.733 --> 00:19:25.404
if you realize that you have to Mother your child.

00:19:27.943 --> 00:19:32.802
Now if the mother is ugly, the child will be ugly too.

00:19:33.003 --> 00:19:36.919
Because it is the mother who is expressed in the child.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.239
She doesn’t dominate the child all right,

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:45.244
but she definitely can corrupt the image of the child.

00:19:46.448 --> 00:19:52.083
And that’s what exactly happens when we, the Sahaja Yogis,

00:19:52.284 --> 00:19:55.286
are not bothered as to look after our Spirit

00:19:55.487 --> 00:20:00.111
and our spiritual growth. Even now, you will be surprised,

00:20:00.312 --> 00:20:03.900
fifty percent people write letters to Me:

00:20:04.101 --> 00:20:06.978
"Mother I am still possessed,

00:20:07.179 --> 00:20:10.376
I have worked with lemons and chilies,

00:20:10.577 --> 00:20:13.790
I am coming to you for this and that."

00:20:13.991 --> 00:20:17.811
It is a very low-grade business. I think even after so many years

00:20:17.836 --> 00:20:21.124
if you are possessed, then I think you should beat yourself

00:20:21.149 --> 00:20:23.153
every day hundred and eight times.

00:20:23.354 --> 00:20:29.481
It’s a very low grade behavior, I personally think,

00:20:29.682 --> 00:20:33.396
that after your Mother has worked so hard with you;

00:20:33.421 --> 00:20:37.283
you are still just the same, coming back with the

00:20:37.308 --> 00:20:43.127
horrible idea of bringing

00:20:43.152 --> 00:20:47.440
all kinds of problems to your Mother.

00:20:49.019 --> 00:20:53.756
That means you have not looking after your child.

00:20:53.957 --> 00:20:57.029
Now in Sahaja Yoga it’s not a child

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:00.404
which is an individual child you have to look after.

00:21:00.605 --> 00:21:05.342
This is, one should understand. This is where we miss very much,

00:21:05.543 --> 00:21:08.545
especially by the intellectuals.

00:21:08.746 --> 00:21:12.717
They think it is their own child which should be all right,

00:21:12.918 --> 00:21:16.941
doesn’t matter about others’ children. Or, doesn’t matter

00:21:16.966 --> 00:21:21.118
if you have connection with others or not. It’s very common.

00:21:21.319 --> 00:21:23.109
Because, in the rationality gives them that sense,

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:26.164
"Oh my spirits are all right, my vibrations are all right,

00:21:26.365 --> 00:21:28.997
so it is all right if I do not go to puja

00:21:29.198 --> 00:21:31.560
or if I do not go to any collective thing

00:21:31.761 --> 00:21:34.640
or if I do not support in any collective work

00:21:34.665 --> 00:21:38.661
or if I do not take any responsibility of Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:38.862 --> 00:21:43.302
Because once you become collective you take responsibilities.

00:21:43.503 --> 00:21:47.888
So you are over satisfied with yourself that is good,

00:21:48.089 --> 00:21:52.068
that I need not take up any responsibility.

00:21:52.269 --> 00:21:55.443
All the Sahaja Yogis are bad, or some of them are bad.

00:21:55.644 --> 00:22:00.920
I have nothing to do with them and this is that and that and that.

00:22:01.121 --> 00:22:07.300
But in Sahaja Yoga as it is, the Motherhood is universal.

00:22:08.371 --> 00:22:16.372
Because if you are the nose, say then somebody is the eye;

00:22:16.573 --> 00:22:22.705
if you are the ears, somebody is the lips.

00:22:23.386 --> 00:22:28.287
So, it is essential for you to understand

00:22:28.488 --> 00:22:35.029
that anybody who is a Sahaja Yogi is in trouble,

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:39.373
you are in trouble. Is threat to your growth;

00:22:39.574 --> 00:22:43.090
it is a threat to your growth, because it is the Whole that is growing.

00:22:43.115 --> 00:22:45.766
Of course, those who are absolutely useless

00:22:45.967 --> 00:22:50.696
will be thrown away, gradually. That’s what Mother does.

00:22:50.897 --> 00:22:56.673
They can be thrown away absolutely,

00:22:56.874 --> 00:22:59.743
so much far away that they will never return.

00:22:59.944 --> 00:23:02.571
But you don’t have to worry about such people,

00:23:02.772 --> 00:23:06.657
they will be thrown away. They will be given some chances,

00:23:06.858 --> 00:23:12.516
some more credits will be given, some graces will be given,

00:23:12.717 --> 00:23:15.446
but ultimately they will be thrown away. So you don’t have to worry.

00:23:15.647 --> 00:23:18.055
But you must worry about the Whole.

00:23:18.256 --> 00:23:22.227
And you have to take up the responsibility.

00:23:22.428 --> 00:23:26.625
Those who do not take up the responsibility

00:23:26.826 --> 00:23:32.211
are not the people who are yet matured their child—

00:23:32.412 --> 00:23:35.031
that’s the Spirit.

00:23:35.232 --> 00:23:38.367
Every type of responsibility that you can take,

00:23:38.568 --> 00:23:41.851
think of what responsibilities you can take.

00:23:42.052 --> 00:23:44.812
That is why most of us have bad Vishuddhis,

00:23:45.013 --> 00:23:47.718
because we do not take the responsibilities,

00:23:47.919 --> 00:23:50.765
and whatever responsibility we do take

00:23:50.966 --> 00:23:55.249
we have to be much, much, much more responsible

00:23:55.450 --> 00:24:00.879
than ordinary government servants are.

00:24:03.164 --> 00:24:07.432
Sometimes we hear from one ear and throw it away from the same—

00:24:07.633 --> 00:24:11.750
don’t even allow it to come into the head.

00:24:15.047 --> 00:24:21.760
So, one has to understand that the child is your responsibility,

00:24:21.961 --> 00:24:24.073
you have to look after the child.

00:24:24.274 --> 00:24:29.656
And the Whole is also your responsibility.

00:24:30.907 --> 00:24:36.808
Now, how to establish the connection between your Spirit,

00:24:37.009 --> 00:24:41.691
or keep the connection on between the Spirit and the womb,

00:24:41.892 --> 00:24:45.515
or the Kundalini,

00:24:45.716 --> 00:24:48.382
is the biggest problem that we all face:

00:24:48.583 --> 00:24:51.374
that our connections are very loose

00:24:51.575 --> 00:24:58.700
and that’s why this Kundalini cannot look after the Spirit.

00:24:59.036 --> 00:25:02.858
I wonder if you have noticed one thing in Sahaja Yoga,

00:25:03.059 --> 00:25:08.699
that you can maneuver the Kundalini, but not the Spirit.

00:25:10.794 --> 00:25:13.674
You can raise your hand; the Kundalini will move.

00:25:13.875 --> 00:25:15.830
You can maneuver it.

00:25:16.031 --> 00:25:19.596
You can give it a bandhan, it will go around and round and round.

00:25:19.797 --> 00:25:23.299
But what about the Spirit?

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.822
You cannot maneuver it.

00:25:26.023 --> 00:25:28.824
There is only one mantra to awaken the Spirit,

00:25:29.025 --> 00:25:33.238
in the sense that to please him you have to say you are the Spirit.

00:25:33.439 --> 00:25:36.581
But you cannot maneuver it. You have to bring in Kundalini

00:25:36.782 --> 00:25:40.472
to look after it, you have to take Kundalini there,

00:25:40.673 --> 00:25:46.027
to the heart, so that this child

00:25:46.228 --> 00:25:50.027
which is the little offspring just now

00:25:50.228 --> 00:25:56.837
has to be carefully developed and matured.

00:25:59.277 --> 00:26:03.679
So on both the sides, of men or women,

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:09.710
we have to understand, that if you are a man,

00:26:09.911 --> 00:26:14.898
and if you are dominating man, it’s all right.

00:26:15.099 --> 00:26:17.453
But if you are a woman and if you are dominating,

00:26:17.654 --> 00:26:20.641
then it’s a difficult thing for Sahaja Yoga to cure you,

00:26:20.842 --> 00:26:23.329
because you have lost your quality of being a woman.

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:26.360
At least you have to be a woman to begin with.

00:26:26.561 --> 00:26:29.203
If you are not even a woman, then what can you do with

00:26:29.404 --> 00:26:34.341
this third persons who are neither man nor woman?

00:26:34.943 --> 00:26:38.114
Now the men, when they are dominating, they have to understand,

00:26:38.315 --> 00:26:41.786
that they have to be compassionate.

00:26:41.987 --> 00:26:46.075
They have to be kind,

00:26:46.276 --> 00:26:52.286
they have to be considerate, but never subservient,

00:26:52.487 --> 00:26:56.342
never subservient. This is one should understand,

00:26:56.543 --> 00:26:59.725
that you should not be subservient.

00:26:59.926 --> 00:27:02.858
Now the women, what they have to be;

00:27:03.059 --> 00:27:07.671
is to be great, large, receptive;

00:27:07.872 --> 00:27:10.710
receiving

00:27:10.911 --> 00:27:14.082
and nourishing all that.

00:27:15.567 --> 00:27:19.037
Now the way husbands are told sometimes in this West—

00:27:19.238 --> 00:27:22.370
I am shocked.

00:27:23.441 --> 00:27:26.740
Wife says this to Mr. X, "X you haven’t done this,

00:27:26.941 --> 00:27:29.115
X you haven’t done that. How have you put this?

00:27:29.316 --> 00:27:33.224
Do this, do that, do that." It’s not woman’s way of doing it,

00:27:33.425 --> 00:27:37.751
it’s absolutely wrong that to do it.

00:27:37.952 --> 00:27:41.340
To tell him to do something.

00:27:41.541 --> 00:27:45.129
You are becoming a manly, and then we lose completely

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:53.672
that power of giving that nourishment of a woman’s love,

00:27:53.873 --> 00:27:56.539
which is the power of a woman,

00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:00.469
which women don’t understand. I’ll tell you a simple example;

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:04.484
My own grand daughter. She wants to be an air hostess all the time, she wants.

00:28:04.685 --> 00:28:07.062
She says, "You must have also thought of being an air hostess."

00:28:07.263 --> 00:28:09.515
I said, "Why? What is so great about air hostess?"

00:28:09.716 --> 00:28:15.184
She says, “That’s the only time you can give food to someone.”

00:28:16.732 --> 00:28:22.414
You see a natural instinct of a Mother that let me see them eat, you see.

00:28:22.615 --> 00:28:27.521
They don’t eat themselves, they want others to eat.

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:32.407
But this is not in the conception of the western women, I tell you.

00:28:32.608 --> 00:28:34.345
They can’t understand this.

00:28:34.546 --> 00:28:37.540
"Why? I have done this, so why not he does this, this."

00:28:37.741 --> 00:28:41.267
It’s your privilege to do these things properly,

00:28:41.468 --> 00:28:42.861
in a proper way.

00:28:43.062 --> 00:28:46.009
But supposing somebody is a very good mechanic,

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:49.267
the woman will also become a mechanic, "I’ll do the mechanical things".

00:28:49.468 --> 00:28:51.462
She is not there for doing mechanical work.

00:28:51.663 --> 00:28:57.600
She is there for the mechanics of the emotions.

00:28:58.686 --> 00:29:01.055
On the contrary she just does the other way round.

00:29:01.256 --> 00:29:03.118
Like a man comes home; she goes on ordering,

00:29:03.319 --> 00:29:06.227
"You have to put that right, why did you spoil my carpet?

00:29:06.428 --> 00:29:10.641
Why did you do this? Clean it up, get that thing, do that."

00:29:10.842 --> 00:29:15.992
All his mechanics of emotions are finished.

00:29:16.193 --> 00:29:18.848
Once his mechanics of emotions are finished,

00:29:19.049 --> 00:29:22.523
he is useless and you are useless as it is.

00:29:22.724 --> 00:29:27.692
And men also should not do their jobs. Let them do their own jobs.

00:29:28.279 --> 00:29:33.008
I think this is one of the biggest problems of the West today.

00:29:33.209 --> 00:29:39.336
That men are neither men, and women are not women.

00:29:39.537 --> 00:29:42.477
I find the quality so horrid,

00:29:42.678 --> 00:29:46.102
that I don’t know how to deal with the mixtures.

00:29:46.303 --> 00:29:50.797
You must understand this very simple thing in life

00:29:50.998 --> 00:29:54.102
that if you are a hybrid stuff,

00:29:54.303 --> 00:29:57.797
you can’t have the quality of a Sahaja Yogi.

00:29:57.998 --> 00:30:00.961
If you mix it up, it’s a very funny thing, isn’t it?

00:30:01.162 --> 00:30:04.809
So a woman must try to be a woman

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:07.332
and a man must try to be a man.

00:30:07.533 --> 00:30:14.276
Now see, what is the situation, of a man,

00:30:14.477 --> 00:30:23.252
as a masculine effect on the development of consciousness?

00:30:23.453 --> 00:30:27.385
So, as the manliness was expressed

00:30:27.586 --> 00:30:31.328
we have developed science.

00:30:32.141 --> 00:30:35.588
We have developed all this knowledge,

00:30:35.789 --> 00:30:39.440
all these things which are outside.

00:30:39.641 --> 00:30:42.620
Now everything is ready.

00:30:42.821 --> 00:30:45.413
Now the woman has to come up.

00:30:45.614 --> 00:30:48.397
I mean, I am saying in the very abstract way; don’t think of woman,

00:30:48.598 --> 00:30:50.670
but you can say the feminine.

00:30:50.871 --> 00:30:54.748
The feminine nature has to rise now.

00:30:54.972 --> 00:30:59.091
Now everything is ready, it has to just spark.

00:30:59.669 --> 00:31:03.928
All the chakras are ready, now awaken the Kundalini.

00:31:04.129 --> 00:31:09.576
Kundalini is as important as the other chakras are.

00:31:09.785 --> 00:31:12.857
So now awaken the Kundalini. Now Kundalini’s behavior

00:31:13.058 --> 00:31:15.568
and mode of action is very different

00:31:15.769 --> 00:31:20.573
from the mode of action of the chakras.

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:27.475
If the Kundalini becomes the chakras and the chakras become the Kundalini,

00:31:27.676 --> 00:31:32.570
how will you manage Sahaja Yoga? But we must assume

00:31:32.771 --> 00:31:37.871
our own nature in all dignity and in all pride;

00:31:38.057 --> 00:31:41.958
not to feel any way low down. Because a man sits on a horse,

00:31:42.159 --> 00:31:45.403
the woman wants to sit on a horse.

00:31:45.604 --> 00:31:48.880
What is the need for a woman to sit on a horse,

00:31:49.081 --> 00:31:51.771
I can’t understand. Here all the women are sitting on a horse.

00:31:51.972 --> 00:31:54.185
They’ll become like horses.

00:31:54.386 --> 00:31:58.974
Already I think half of your royal family looks like horses,

00:31:59.175 --> 00:32:01.919
don’t they?

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:05.411
I think so. Their faces look like horses.

00:32:05.612 --> 00:32:09.072
See, so there is no need for women to do

00:32:09.097 --> 00:32:12.489
all the things that man have already done. Say, for example,

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:16.989
there’s one personality of masculine personality that has to come

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:20.606
and do a certain job. Now you’ve done it.

00:32:20.807 --> 00:32:23.370
All right now the another personality has to do this job.

00:32:23.571 --> 00:32:27.511
Now see the situation of the Divine also.

00:32:28.525 --> 00:32:31.388
Now the whole complication comes in that

00:32:31.413 --> 00:32:34.306
once a kind of a thing has been done,

00:32:34.507 --> 00:32:38.462
the another one that comes wants to do the same.

00:32:38.663 --> 00:32:40.782
Do you follow My point?

00:32:40.983 --> 00:32:45.850
So the whole energy is completely wasted.

00:32:46.801 --> 00:32:49.182
The whole preparation has been made

00:32:49.207 --> 00:32:51.920
for this Aquarius age to come in

00:32:52.297 --> 00:32:54.764
to bring in the Kundalini upward

00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:56.990
and to make the whole work out

00:32:57.191 --> 00:32:59.810
in such way that the left and right meet

00:33:00.011 --> 00:33:06.193
and you all become ignited enlightened

00:33:06.394 --> 00:33:13.529
It was a question of our being sharing the whole job

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:15.545
in a proper understanding

00:33:15.746 --> 00:33:17.733
Now see how Mother Earth Herself was created,

00:33:17.934 --> 00:33:20.421
it is also a very simple thing

00:33:20.622 --> 00:33:28.873
First, the movement of the energy started flowing.

00:33:29.074 --> 00:33:32.139
Now this is a combined energy all right?

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:36.748
Then the combined energy went round and round and round like that.

00:33:36.949 --> 00:33:41.732
And when it consolidated there was a-this big bang.

00:33:41.933 --> 00:33:45.349
When big bang took place—now this is the manly work,

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:47.896
I should say in a way; manly style,

00:33:48.097 --> 00:33:51.459
because still the Mother earth is not produced—

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:56.920
so then these little fragments again went round and round.

00:33:57.121 --> 00:33:59.217
With the momentum, they became roundish.

00:33:59.418 --> 00:34:02.561
Out of them the Mother Earth was selected for one job.

00:34:02.762 --> 00:34:05.358
Not to do anything - you keep quiet now.

00:34:05.559 --> 00:34:13.334
Alright. On the Mother Earth out of the water came the life—

00:34:13.535 --> 00:34:16.272
the carbon came in.

00:34:16.473 --> 00:34:20.592
Everybody helped there and a human being was created.

00:34:20.793 --> 00:34:23.869
Then the men went round, to improve their societies

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:26.525
and whatever they have done to it, whatever was possible

00:34:26.726 --> 00:34:29.414
with their ego is done, finished now.

00:34:29.615 --> 00:34:34.899
Now they have done their job, you see. Now they are on dole,

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:37.352
you can say.

00:34:37.553 --> 00:34:42.399
Now the womb, or we can say the Kundalini

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.235
which has been waiting all these years, was resting,

00:34:45.436 --> 00:34:47.868
waiting for that time, isn’t it? So we call it:

00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:50.220
"the blossom time has now come".

00:34:50.421 --> 00:34:56.392
At that time the Kundalini has to rise and ignite,

00:34:56.593 --> 00:35:00.945
in such a way that the completion of the whole work takes place—

00:35:01.146 --> 00:35:05.200
it is simple. Do you understand now?

00:35:05.834 --> 00:35:10.235
So there’s no competition between men or women,

00:35:10.436 --> 00:35:14.227
but the style of work is different.

00:35:14.428 --> 00:35:18.719
If you understand that, then only this kind of revolution

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:21.219
will take place and not turn out a rebellion.

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:24.453
Actually women are rebelling against men, and a nonsense it is.

00:35:24.654 --> 00:35:28.070
It is such a headache, that you create something,

00:35:28.271 --> 00:35:30.912
allow them to grow, and the another party comes

00:35:31.113 --> 00:35:35.193
which has to complete the job starts rebelling.

00:35:35.394 --> 00:35:39.354
So the revolution has to take place and this revolution is only possible

00:35:39.555 --> 00:35:46.242
when we understand that what part is left out now to be done.

00:35:48.567 --> 00:35:51.655
Are you getting Me all right?

00:35:51.856 --> 00:35:55.803
So that part is now Realization,

00:35:56.004 --> 00:35:59.326
our awakening of the Kundalini.

00:35:59.527 --> 00:36:04.795
For that your feminine qualities are going to help you,

00:36:04.996 --> 00:36:07.349
not your masculine qualities.

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:11.029
So aggressiveness must be given up by men.

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:13.482
Also, because they are Sahaja Yogis now,

00:36:13.683 --> 00:36:16.654
they have to take feminine qualities. Not of fighting.

00:36:16.855 --> 00:36:19.545
If women fight they are not women.

00:36:19.746 --> 00:36:22.850
You see, women are told that

00:36:23.051 --> 00:36:29.702
"you are useless, you are good for nothing",

00:36:29.903 --> 00:36:34.350
so now they are trying to show, ‘no’, we are also all right.

00:36:34.551 --> 00:36:39.457
If you have eaten one crow we will eat three."

00:36:41.417 --> 00:36:52.761
Now, this understanding and the wise perception would be such that

00:36:52.962 --> 00:36:55.988
"what do we have to do now to change the mode

00:36:56.189 --> 00:36:58.519
and the style of our lives?"

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.222
What’s wrong here?

00:37:01.423 --> 00:37:03.613
A turning point has come.

00:37:03.814 --> 00:37:10.769
Now the evolution is not rebellion, at all by any chance.

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:14.566
It’s a wrong idea people have. It’s not rebellion,

00:37:14.767 --> 00:37:17.099
that you hit me and I hit you—go on hitting each other,

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:19.982
like a pendulum you move; you see the movement of a pendulum.

00:37:20.183 --> 00:37:23.755
It’s not like a boom, this thing—that today you are born as a Muslim,

00:37:23.956 --> 00:37:26.496
tomorrow you are born as a Jew, then you are born as a Jew,

00:37:26.697 --> 00:37:28.871
then you are born as a Hindu, then you are born as—

00:37:29.072 --> 00:37:33.184
it’s not pendulum. It is spiral movement.

00:37:33.385 --> 00:37:38.043
So every time you achieve an evolution

00:37:38.244 --> 00:37:40.231
you are at a higher level than before.

00:37:40.432 --> 00:37:44.309
So the movement is spiral—see My point?

00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:51.590
Now to achieve the higher position in our whole being

00:37:51.791 --> 00:37:53.746
what should we do?

00:37:53.947 --> 00:37:57.637
Is to understand that from this point to that point we have to rise—

00:37:57.838 --> 00:38:05.714
we have to rise in a way that we move in such a way

00:38:05.915 --> 00:38:14.122
that it is not in a pendulum way but in a spiral way.

00:38:14.506 --> 00:38:21.485
And to move spirally, you have to use another kind of force.

00:38:21.686 --> 00:38:26.305
Whatever you have used so far has to be endowed

00:38:26.506 --> 00:38:28.300
with another kind of force

00:38:28.501 --> 00:38:31.308
and that’s the feminine qualities of women.

00:38:31.509 --> 00:38:34.894
But where are the feminine women?

00:38:35.095 --> 00:38:39.050
They dress up like women, they will try to be feminine

00:38:39.251 --> 00:38:43.519
and all that. That’s not the way. From inside, from the heart.

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:49.386
A feminine heart. Christ showed that in His life—

00:38:49.587 --> 00:38:52.972
He forgave. Only a woman can forgive, man cannot,

00:38:53.173 --> 00:38:56.863
because he is aggressive. How can he forgive?

00:38:57.064 --> 00:39:00.886
Krishna never forgave anyone. He used to kill.

00:39:01.087 --> 00:39:08.540
Right royal fashion, go, all right? if you are so, all right. Done.

00:39:08.997 --> 00:39:12.007
He forgave to such an extent to show that

00:39:12.208 --> 00:39:16.890
He is now giving a turn to the spiral

00:39:17.091 --> 00:39:22.023
and now a feminine quality has to be developed among human beings.

00:39:22.224 --> 00:39:25.211
But that doesn’t mean that you start walking like women

00:39:25.412 --> 00:39:30.162
or developing waistlines.

00:39:32.662 --> 00:39:35.727
Because that’s another stupidity.

00:39:35.928 --> 00:39:39.227
But to be Motherly.

00:39:39.428 --> 00:39:43.383
Not to be fatherly, but to be Motherly.

00:39:43.584 --> 00:39:47.188
That kindness, that gentleness

00:39:47.389 --> 00:39:51.258
should be in your behavior towards each other.

00:39:51.459 --> 00:39:55.774
Of course this force also corrects, sometimes also gets angry also.

00:39:55.975 --> 00:39:58.540
Mother also has to get angry sometimes,

00:39:58.741 --> 00:40:02.298
especially with people who never get all right with their behavior,

00:40:02.499 --> 00:40:04.837
She has to be shouting, punishing,

00:40:05.038 --> 00:40:09.321
and sometimes She also destroys; it’s all right.

00:40:09.522 --> 00:40:14.397
But that is sometimes, not all the time.

00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:20.766
So just now one has to accept that to be like the Mother Earth

00:40:20.967 --> 00:40:24.282
we have to be forbearing—Dhara.

00:40:24.483 --> 00:40:29.509
Daharaitey sadara. She is the sustenance of everything.

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:34.665
She takes everything, the vibrations are sucked in; see, talk about it.

00:40:34.866 --> 00:40:37.431
And now for the first time after Realization,

00:40:37.632 --> 00:40:42.251
you can give Her back what you have got it, from Her.

00:40:42.452 --> 00:40:44.695
You can give vibrations to Her trees that are created, y

00:40:44.896 --> 00:40:49.708
ou can make them beautiful. You can transform a flower

00:40:49.936 --> 00:40:53.001
into a more beautiful flower.

00:40:53.202 --> 00:40:55.587
Now whatever you have got from the Mother Earth

00:40:55.788 --> 00:41:00.767
you can give because your Mother Earth is awakened within you now.

00:41:00.968 --> 00:41:01.968
So you return Her back everything that you got from Her

00:41:04.261 --> 00:41:08.826
and give it to others. Generosity, the greatness of heart,

00:41:09.027 --> 00:41:16.006
nobility, forgiveness, love, affection, bearing everything for love.

00:41:16.207 --> 00:41:20.467
And for the mother, to save her child, she’ll starve herself,

00:41:20.668 --> 00:41:24.303
she’ll do everything to save her child,

00:41:24.504 --> 00:41:28.287
complete dedication she has for her child.

00:41:28.488 --> 00:41:31.874
That’s a real mother—I mean the kind of mothers you see these days,

00:41:32.075 --> 00:41:34.818
neither they are mothers nor women. But what I am saying,

00:41:35.019 --> 00:41:41.050
that’s the real image of a mother, and you have a image before you.

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:46.387
So, this is what one has to develop now,

00:41:46.588 --> 00:41:49.371
whether you are men or women as Sahaja Yogis

00:41:49.572 --> 00:41:53.551
you must develop a new consciousness of affection,

00:41:53.752 --> 00:41:56.676
love and compassion.

00:41:56.877 --> 00:42:01.481
Getting angry, getting into a temper, shouting at people,

00:42:01.682 --> 00:42:06.137
screaming at people—is not going to help you much.

00:42:06.338 --> 00:42:08.926
If you have to help the whole, the growth of the whole,

00:42:09.127 --> 00:42:13.434
try to make yourself a milder person—

00:42:13.635 --> 00:42:16.707
be angry with yourself that you are losing tempers

00:42:16.908 --> 00:42:21.387
and you are so unkind to others.

00:42:21.588 --> 00:42:26.278
All the problems have come out of the over-growth of the masculinity—

00:42:26.479 --> 00:42:28.841
over-growth. It reaches a certain point, you see,

00:42:29.042 --> 00:42:34.346
it’s reached such a wretched point now, that it has to come down.

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:42.046
But also femininity, at a lower level, without Realization

00:42:42.247 --> 00:42:46.819
could be very, very small hearted, chicken hearted,

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:51.645
could be all the time worried about her own child.

00:42:52.043 --> 00:42:55.600
That’s what one has to change—

00:42:55.801 --> 00:43:00.663
is to have love and affection for every Sahaja Yogi,

00:43:00.864 --> 00:43:04.338
for every person. When it comes to fighting others

00:43:04.539 --> 00:43:08.940
you are all one but among yourselves you can look after each other,

00:43:09.141 --> 00:43:12.534
tell them—say for example, something is paining in my nose here,

00:43:12.735 --> 00:43:15.292
I will just try to rub it in the same way.

00:43:15.493 --> 00:43:20.698
But I won’t try to cut my nose will I? Or bang my nose, I won’t?

00:43:20.899 --> 00:43:25.843
So the feeling that the other is myself; be kind and gentle—

00:43:26.044 --> 00:43:29.374
try to improve and help in that manner.

00:43:29.575 --> 00:43:32.140
I hope you have understood the whole thing.

00:43:32.341 --> 00:43:36.029
In a nutshell is that: we have to change the whole mode—

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:41.131
a radical change has to come in the society of Sahaja Yogis.

00:43:41.332 --> 00:43:46.613
Now, if there is any question you ask Me, before we start the puja.

00:43:48.832 --> 00:43:53.823
Now the problem of divorce and all that, you can see this respect.

00:44:04.931 --> 00:44:10.188
Left Nabhi problem, we can talk to.

00:44:37.687 --> 00:44:40.988
What is it?

00:44:46.282 --> 00:44:48.602
See.

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:55.292
This problem comes in where you are not the whole.

00:44:55.493 --> 00:44:57.292
All right?

00:44:57.493 --> 00:45:01.440
Now supposing, as I told you, if you are the whole,

00:45:01.641 --> 00:45:05.391
then who is the other?

00:45:06.594 --> 00:45:09.666
Then you will, even if you have to hurt. Say, for example,

00:45:09.867 --> 00:45:13.854
if there is blood coming out of my thumb,

00:45:14.055 --> 00:45:18.260
I press it hard to stop the blood. It will hurt the thumb, thing.

00:45:18.461 --> 00:45:21.462
But the discrimination must be used, that I'm loosing my blood

00:45:21.663 --> 00:45:23.961
which is precious, much more precious than this finger

00:45:24.162 --> 00:45:27.380
it will hurt.

00:45:28.904 --> 00:45:30.937
But that discretion must be achieved, you see.

00:45:31.138 --> 00:45:33.031
In Sahaja Yoga, you're all free to develop

00:45:33.232 --> 00:45:35.203
your sense of discretion.

00:45:35.404 --> 00:45:37.292
And once you develop your sense of discretion,

00:45:37.493 --> 00:45:39.847
gradually you will know what to do. In the beginning you will hurt,

00:45:40.048 --> 00:45:42.488
no doubt, because you are used to that.

00:45:42.689 --> 00:45:45.105
I've seen people here, just barking at each other,

00:45:45.306 --> 00:45:48.300
as soon as they see each other they start barking.

00:45:48.501 --> 00:45:50.691
You go anywhere in the whole country you go anywhere,

00:45:50.892 --> 00:45:52.910
they start barking for nothing at all. I was surprised.

00:45:53.111 --> 00:45:54.332
In a school, I went there,

00:45:54.533 --> 00:45:56.777
there also everybody is barking at each other, you know.

00:45:56.978 --> 00:45:59.582
Whether they are drunk or not drunk, makes no difference-

00:45:59.783 --> 00:46:04.425
is the same state. But after Realization, you do say.

00:46:04.626 --> 00:46:09.269
Because you feel concerned, you're worried.

00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:14.308
But you say in such a way that you achieve the result.

00:46:14.509 --> 00:46:17.347
See My point is-that is the criteria:

00:46:17.548 --> 00:46:21.407
that you should achieve the results.

00:46:22.251 --> 00:46:24.652
But, supposing a man has come for the first time, and tell him

00:46:24.853 --> 00:46:27.386
that "you are a bhoot",

00:46:27.587 --> 00:46:31.714
then naturally he will be hurt;

00:46:31.915 --> 00:46:35.415
very common.

00:46:37.337 --> 00:46:40.730
First day, somebody walks in and you say "you are a bhoot".

00:46:40.931 --> 00:46:42.764
I mean, thank God if he doesn't understand the meaning

00:46:42.965 --> 00:46:47.300
of the word bhoot -then it's all right.

00:46:51.268 --> 00:46:56.395
But first you think of being gentle, nice,

00:46:56.596 --> 00:47:01.653
embalming, sweet. Let's see, find out ways and methods;

00:47:01.854 --> 00:47:04.755
there's a very good way-in the evening, to write down

00:47:04.956 --> 00:47:09.323
"how many sweet things I've said today."

00:47:14.401 --> 00:47:16.708
Not like this, sweet things we say,

00:47:16.909 --> 00:47:20.028
"You're looking beautiful" all that.

00:47:20.229 --> 00:47:25.260
Not the superficial ones. That may pamper the ego.

00:47:25.596 --> 00:47:28.567
But they're so sweet you know, things are.

00:47:28.768 --> 00:47:35.114
Let's say

00:47:35.315 --> 00:47:37.934
there are some very good words,

00:47:38.135 --> 00:47:42.486
you can say, like-"Are you warm enough?"

00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:47.184
-very sweet way of asking a question. Then, it's very simple;

00:47:47.385 --> 00:47:49.144
but you can say like that.

00:47:49.345 --> 00:47:52.839
Just-it's very difficult for people to say that even, I've seen.

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:56.386
Looking after others comforts. Somebody is sitting, he wants water.

00:47:56.587 --> 00:48:00.330
Awkwardly sitting. You just go rush and given him water.

00:48:00.531 --> 00:48:06.190
Oh that's too much to expect. That, Oh God you gave water,

00:48:06.391 --> 00:48:10.393
"I'm not his servant"-immediately the question comes into the head.

00:48:10.594 --> 00:48:14.557
Little bit trying to do something here and there.

00:48:14.758 --> 00:48:19.440
Or sometimes thinking-going in the market,

00:48:19.641 --> 00:48:23.174
you find something. "Oh let me take it for him".

00:48:23.375 --> 00:48:25.507
Children do. I've seen children all the time;

00:48:25.708 --> 00:48:32.583
they think of their friends-what they can buy for others.

00:48:34.775 --> 00:48:36.824
"This is good for my friend, this is good for..."

00:48:37.025 --> 00:48:38.660
She's very fond of things, she "likes. . ."

00:48:38.861 --> 00:48:41.207
All these little-little things, you know.

00:48:41.408 --> 00:48:43.340
Sometimes even a small thing

00:48:43.541 --> 00:48:44.942
like; early in the morning you get up,

00:48:45.143 --> 00:48:47.677
you find the another person is sleeping on one side,

00:48:47.878 --> 00:48:52.505
his blanket on the third side and his pillow in the fourth side.

00:48:52.706 --> 00:48:54.464
So you just put his head on the pillow

00:48:54.665 --> 00:48:58.956
and cover him with the blanket. That's mother's job.

00:49:02.299 --> 00:49:07.252
Not out of fear, but out of sheer love.

00:49:09.226 --> 00:49:12.017
Like even if it is cold and buttons are open,

00:49:12.218 --> 00:49:16.431
you can button up a person you like. Little-little things you know.

00:49:16.632 --> 00:49:19.244
Women have very little-sweet things which they do,

00:49:19.445 --> 00:49:25.359
which makes men very happy. But women have lost now, that sense.

00:49:29.839 --> 00:49:32.003
Not the fighting, but thinking of

00:49:32.204 --> 00:49:34.511
what sweet things you can do for him.

00:49:34.712 --> 00:49:38.844
And also, sometimes teasing is all right.

00:49:40.446 --> 00:49:43.815
Sometimes tickling is all right.

00:49:44.016 --> 00:49:50.307
But a kind of a sweet you see rapport between each other;

00:49:50.508 --> 00:49:56.281
even the feeling, that we can do that. It's a master's job.

00:49:56.985 --> 00:49:59.943
Is a master's job. The one who is a master can do it,

00:50:00.144 --> 00:50:02.290
those who are not, will not be able to.

00:50:02.491 --> 00:50:06.031
They'll again come back to hurt. Ultimately, they'll land up

00:50:06.056 --> 00:50:09.115
with hurting or biting or coming to blows.

00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:12.088
But those who are masters will be so beautifully doing

00:50:12.289 --> 00:50:18.158
the whole job that you see a kind of a very sweet relationship-

00:50:18.359 --> 00:50:21.044
it's called Madhurya. Without any lust,

00:50:21.069 --> 00:50:24.980
without any money-business, anything. Such sweet relationships.

00:50:25.181 --> 00:50:29.485
And the joy would be bubbling.

00:50:30.634 --> 00:50:33.363
All these perversions, all these things will drop off.

00:50:33.564 --> 00:50:38.064
But a very sweet relationship-

00:50:43.142 --> 00:50:49.009
all right? Even saying that, you are feeling happy.
