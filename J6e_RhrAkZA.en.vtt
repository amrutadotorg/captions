There is a girl, you see,  called Valérie, in London

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:42.700
She's trying to make a picture of  [inaudible] guru suffering, you see,

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.960
how people have suffered. And for a [inaudible]

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.600
I said, the best is Robert to talk about the thing.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.260
Just one fellow woman

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.580

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.000

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.160
Have you shown Robert and all these people about that puja?

00:07:22.065 --> 00:07:23.440
I did not hear from them Mother

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.160
Mother, I got a letter from Gregoire and he says

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.140
it's the 28.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:30.760
24.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.760
Nobody has sent any letters here?

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:39.920
No, we've received one lettre from Gregoire and there is - in the letter

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.940

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:48.500
So we have changed you know now, and we are translating it in French

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.580

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.760
All the, all the details about it.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.500
Only one paper, only one letter.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.280
Macha?

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.940
Mother, they are been sent out of London and I was just watching it

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.340
and they were still  being put on. So they'll be coming soon to the other centres.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.000
Oh, I see.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.820
There're some more packs here for informations.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:08.640
Yes, yes.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.040
It's complete and will be sent.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.700
Now, luckily, you see, they got a nice place.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.040
And of different prices so it will suit everyone.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.740
Some people can stay in rooms,

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.780
some can stay in the tents

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.480
Then they have large rooms

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.180
Like that, it will suit every one and it's quite something out taste, you see,

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.200
it's quite good.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:36.340
And it is away from London. I don't know how many miles.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.120
I could get wrong [inaudible],

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:43.100
one hour's travelling and also from Brighton it is about

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.760
half an hour journey, something. It's a triangle.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.640
And something, it's quite good they said.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.460
Luckily they got it when I was there.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.560
And they are very helpful, they are very nice

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.220
and they are willling to give you nice food.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:59.540
But they have decided to have their own food, [inaudible] also, for two days.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.640
Yessun [unsure] is doing it and you know Yessun is very [inaudible]

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.460
He's doing it very well and he'll make you very comfortable.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.200
Look at that now!

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.740
He's showing noses of every one. See!

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.220
You see, you used to do the same when you were a baby.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:41.880
Did you do that?

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.320
To show noses like this.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.400
Right?

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.640
Just look at that now.

00:10:13.855 --> 00:10:16.905
The younger ones are interrested in animals, you see

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.060
Now he 'll pull your ears better

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.540
What are your exams now Robert?

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.020
Palmal???

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.120
What are your exams?

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.680
What are you [inaudible] lots of things?

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.740
What subject do you take?

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.280
I have to study by heart all the buildings of Europe.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:55.780
Hum?

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.040
All the architecture of Europe.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:58.720
Ah?

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:04.600
From fourteen hundred till seventeen hundred.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.840
It's interesting!

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.080
No

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.360
No, it's not mind. I tell you, it's not mind.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.680
Because you read the styles, you know, repeated for years,

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:25.460
The same style [inaudible] school all over the world [inaudible]

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.460
Like in India [inaudible] you can

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.740
They got their spontaneous people.

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.220
They have not formed any styles.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.540
So,

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.655
they cannot make it into a from or a style,

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:42.880
or you cannot say this period was a - there is little variation in everything.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.620
It's rather intricate.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.800
I've also a course about Indian art actually.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:49.635
You have

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.680
But it's to study their architects

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.600
Hum?

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.040
What artists you have in Indian architecture?

00:12:02.205 --> 00:12:03.195
Tressano.

00:12:03.195 --> 00:12:04.195
Hum?

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.220
Trefandro, no?

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:06.900
What did you say?

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.900
I didn't study it yet, Mother.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:14.520
But, you see, we have, I mean, I don't know how you will be studing it but

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.875
we had only, to begin with,

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.460
we got these Greek people coming in India, you see?

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.780
And they started teaching people how to-

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.920
They knew only how to hew rocks and make big, big temples and all that.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.540
And then, these people came and started teaching us how to make

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.580
houses of big, large,

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:38.880
it's like palaces

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.320
We had palaces before also.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:46.300
But they taught us but the best part of it, they taught us how to hew  the rock also.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.900
And in that they wanted Buddha to look like a Greek, you see.

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.420
So, they gave him mustaches

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.660
and also gave him shoes, you see.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:58.240
And the nose of Buddha is just like a Greek nose, you know, starting from here

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.195
straight down here, like that.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.100
Not like an Indian one

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.700
And Buddha sitting with his shoes on, imagine, with a mustache

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.460
And wearing the same type of a dress

00:13:13.465 --> 00:13:16.165
you know that Greek cloth without any stitching,

00:13:16.165 --> 00:13:17.300
what did you call that?

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.340
A toge.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:19.220
Ah.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:23.020
And the hairs' style, we call it "linger shigary" in Sanskrit.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.480
And same type of hair style that

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.440
they wore at that time. They gave it to him,

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:31.540
that Buddha

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.395
But they had rapports from India

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.160
long, long time, thousand of years back.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.780
Because, when I asked them: "Are you ready to call this bona saker?"

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.240
They said: "We had a rapport from India.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.780
for long, long, time." Say,

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.600
They said about

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.860
six, seven thousands years back.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:58.920
And I think it questions the time when Rama's children, both of them, Lav and Kush,

00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:59.720
went to

00:14:00.475 --> 00:14:02.065
one went to China

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:07.000
and another went to the slave country

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.540
The "slave" word comes from "se-ga"

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:13.020
Lav was one of the name for a lamasya.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.280
Slav.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.720
"Se" means "with"

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.700
"Lav" was one day, one of the "Kashapas"  [unsure]

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:27.440
So that's why the Chineses are called as Kushan, you see?

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:29.780
They are called as Kushan.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.040
Because he was Kush, imagine!

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.060
And this must be thousands of years back. And that was the source.

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:41.380
Even now, they say [inaudible].

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:47.720
It's close, there is a temple of Indulika (?) Devi, one of the Goddesses there.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.400
Shilde  [unsure].

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.940
It's very interesting.

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.700
Alexander came much later.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:07.520
He's happy with it.

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.360
They are the same children.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:47.460
A little one. Thank you.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.900
There's a fragrance actually.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:26.760
They are all now going to America, Sahaja Yogis, those who are [?] they are all trying to go.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.740
Some are going [?] and some are going [?]

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.900
some are going to [?] some to Los Angeles

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.800
and some to San Francisco.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:39.380
We are all trying to see that they are there to  [?] the work out.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.200
Let's see what happens.

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:49.800
That would be a very good idea.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.900
Very good idea, very good idea.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:57.660
You see, actually,

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.520
You see, postering and all that has to be done,

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.520
apart from that,

00:17:10.475 --> 00:17:11.805
[?]

00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:14.575
[?]

00:17:15.105 --> 00:17:18.035
broadcasting from, I saw TV and everything

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:23.460
from this place, what you call [?]

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.360
Then, once it is done, then they say: "that thing will work out."

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:34.480
If that happens, then it will be better

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:38.800
that we can really manage everything. [?] also.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.800
Because newspaper's people are extremely difficult.

00:17:47.035 --> 00:17:49.935
Newspaper in New York especially.

00:17:52.365 --> 00:17:53.895
Very funny ideas.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:17:59.640
Mother?

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.380
Hugh.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:05.020
Will it be possible to stay in some Sahaja Yogi's house if we go there?

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.200
Yes, I think so if you can arrange.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.460
We should. We should be able to.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.540
They are all working but we don't have so many.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:22.000
Actually, there is another thig working out  [?], you see, Modi is going.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:26.000
He's going to take one house and hire it.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:36.940
And which town would you prefer us to do, Mother? Which part of America you would prefer us to go?

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.280
Anywhere, I mean, anywhere.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.060
But, because New York is the worst of all, so more people-

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.200
So, New York.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.760
Catherine settled here.

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:52.200
She's so fed up now.

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:57.920
In one of her letter she writes: "if you come to me, and then we just tell them a little thing that they hear all truth

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.580
they get angry.

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:03.860
You tell them anything, you see, they have preconceived ideas, they'll say: "No, no, you can't get Realization like that.

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:07.215
How do you say?" All this, they have so much overread

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.560
and there have so many people in their heads, that it's impossible."

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:15.140
We have a good experience of that in Paris already, Mother.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:15.660
Right.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:16.480
Is it?

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.940
She said they are very clever.

00:19:20.185 --> 00:19:22.855
[Inaudible]

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.460
She said they are not yet exposed to truth at all.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:37.800
For them it's like to do shopping, there are going from one place to another like that.

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:45.560
But, in other places it has worked, you see, so it should work in America also.

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:49.500
We have to approve the right type of people, that I don’t know what to do.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:54.840
But once there is a good broadcast, I think, people will start thinking about it.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.860
If they hear Me, they’ll start thinking about it.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.280
I gave him some nice- did you write there what I said?

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.380
Yes Mother.

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:08.980
Yes

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:10.900
Can you do that?

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.180
I don’t have it with me, Mother.

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.000
No, no, no.

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.460
You should arrange something

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.400
for people to go there.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:27.120
Aunty Christine has a house then that Herman has a house.

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:29.220
[inaudible] has houses.

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.600
And also you can take a house and hire it.

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:37.140
As Modi is going, he is taking a house on a rent.

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.700
Modi is a very dynamic person, no doubt.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:51.040
But, how far he will be successful in America? You can’t say.

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:54.140
But his presence there might help a lot, I think.

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:55.140
Yes Mother.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:59.340
It will help the Sahaja Yogis to keep Spirit-self.

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.920
Definitely.

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.240
Yes, definitely.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:08.600
Apart from that, you see, there are a lot of Gujaratis and he thinks that he can bring them round.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.980
How many Indians there are, I don’t know.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:16.120
But he thinks so, that he might be able to speak to them and bring them round.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:23.960
But lots of false gurus have left there,  [inaudible]

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.000
they have now gone to Los Angeles.

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:30.560
So the people are carrying on with this.

00:21:31.635 --> 00:21:34.485
Those gurus are dead now,

00:21:34.565 --> 00:21:37.275
they are lost in- they are no more in Los Angeles,

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:42.380
but these people are still having their [inaudible].

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:45.520
They can't forget these gurus.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.820
You see, for them, now it has just become prestigious.

00:21:50.895 --> 00:21:52.755
what to do?

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:57.460
So forget a guru means a prestigious thing.

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:17.600
Dany went there, I mean, they are all, Macha, Dany, then Christine, her husband

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:20.060
now working in New York.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:32.800
Last time, we did a lot; working as much as possible.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.020
But nobody used.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.700
You see, when I go there, definitely people  come, no doubt.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:44.160
Even in New York, we had a lot of them,  sometimes about [inaudible], sometimes unveiled

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:47.040
to two hundred people [inaudible]

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.400
Rosenwald, there were five hundred, six hundred people,

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.840
but they think it's a lot as they were telling me.

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:58.060
Hello!

00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:59.400
Yes, yes!

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:05.000
Mother, some people have arrived from France, Christine.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.240
Hello!

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:08.700
From Mulhouse.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.620
From Mulhouse and some other girls.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:17.420
I think the old people should go out and let the new people come in.

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:18.340
All right, Mother.

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.880
Mother, elder children from Paris?

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.620
Mother, you remember Jean-Yves?

00:23:24.975 --> 00:23:27.275
Yes, yes.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:00.660
So the new people seem to be much more solid

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.500
Yes, Mother.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.880
So how are you?

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:22.300
And there's a lot of now sunshine in France.

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:27.560
There's a lot of bright future for France.

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:47.260
French people are taking to a lot of sad solutions because they thought they had no solution.

00:24:54.340 --> 00:25:01.640
Because they did not know that there is something very great awaiting above minds.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:13.480
And they indulge into all these things very much.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:20.580
But they must know that God has created this world

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:23.220
and that he’s going to look after you.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:30.560
He’s going to bless us.

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:34.860
He’s going to give us all that is born of you and beautiful.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.080
The time has come.

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:45.360
And it’s for you all now to decide that it is God’s work

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:50.000
and how much you must dedicate

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:06.540
It’s going to work for your forefathers because there will be blessed as they have given you life

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.280
and for your progenesis.

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:48.400
French language is small.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.120
French language is very short.

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:06.320
So, now it is your responsibility,

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:09.980
it is a very great responsibility.

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:18.800
The world is standing at a very grave position

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:32.660
because stupid people are using this world for a game

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.820
and to play with it.

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.840
And then to destroy it.

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:51.120
So, it is for you to know what is false, what is real.

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:59.100
And then you have to, after knowing it,

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.140
you have to master the art.

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:09.980
And then, you have to spread it to others.

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.940
It’s only you who can make them masters.

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:24.380
And I’m sure it will spread like fire.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.100
It’s for every place, every place, not only about France, it’s every place.

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:47.320
Robert seems to be very unhappy about Germans' case already.

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:51.540
But even, it should happen just trust Me,  I know.

00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:00.660
We are gathering forces in Germany too.

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:08.480
You see, once the Germans take to Sahaja Yoga, then nobody can stop it.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:22.020
They have still some funny ideas which will drop out by themselves.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:34.640
There are lots of Rajneesh disciples in Germany, lots.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.540
And now, he is in a mess himself you see.

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:47.020
He has to get out of America.

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.080
He can’t talk.

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:53.120
Because his voice is finished, he cannot talk

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:58.740
And they are trying to make out a case out of it.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:02.500
But he cannot talk. So, they say he is not teaching.

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:05.440
A person who cannot talk, how can he be a teacher?

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:27.920
So, they have to- I mean they have decided to throw him out.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:34.620
And once he goes out in that way and he is absolutely exposed,

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:39.160
then it might be that the people will turn right.

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:54.780
Of course, they can twist up many things by saying that

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:58.140
he had been tortured and he is Christ crucified.

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:10.835
Lots of things are working out.

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:18.240
Like this new disease that has come now, AIDS, in America.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:28.940
I heard in England that ten thousands of people are suffering from that.

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.080
But, just imagine,

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:49.320
fifty years back, people were eating very [inaudible]

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:52.860
they probably suffered but nobody had cancer, nobody knew about it.

00:32:01.925 --> 00:32:04.420
All kind of funny diseases,

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:08.300
like when they give estrogen to a chicken.

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:12.820
Those who eat that chicken you get puberty at a very young age,  one year earlier.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:33.080
And there's one boy, at 18 years of age,  I saw him,

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:37.620
he got breast and half body like man and half like woman.

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:47.840
So this is so shocking.

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:54.120
So by saying: "What's wrong. We can do what we like"

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:59.520
all that is coming to an end now.

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:05.340
And Sahaja Yogis also should be very careful when they use all these medicines

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:09.660
as far as the- what you call- the chemical are concerned.

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:12.520
Not very strong medicines.

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:27.560
Try to use simple things.

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:33.960
You don't really need much because you are all Realized souls.

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:42.840
If you know how to master art of Realization, you don't need so much drugs  [unsure].

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:56.140
But, I mean, in case you're getting some troubles also or something chemical, be careful what you use.

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:06.400
Even the toothpate and all little things that  if you use for day-to-day life, you have to be careful.

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:20.420
Actually, I'm trying to test may things just to see how it is reacting.

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:29.220
So that you people don't suffer with the after effects.

00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:37.160
And so we will send you a circular to all of you here

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:40.560
to know what is to be used for soap, for this and that.

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:51.640
And also, I'm very happy that I could meet all the new people over here.

00:35:03.135 --> 00:35:05.385
Martine, Mother comes from Strasbourg.

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:09.820
Martine and that's her mother, Indu,

00:35:17.505 --> 00:35:18.905
Philippe, from Rouen.

00:35:21.515 --> 00:35:23.905
Patrick from Bordeaux.

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:31.280
Sylvie from Toulouse.

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.140
No, Mulhouse.

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:34.180
Sorry.

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:37.880
Then Alain,

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.520
from Mulhouse also.

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:48.060
She's taking care of them, Mother, Christine is taking care of them.

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:51.160
Jean-Pierre.

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:54.340
Bernadette.

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:58.260
Cécile.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.060
Bernadette.

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.420
Mulhouse also.

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:08.540
So nice to see you all here.

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:10.180
Some more.

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.580
Nicole

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.620
Lausanne Mother.

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:33.520
And Joël, he has not come.

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:44.760
I would say that for those who have come for the first time should sit inside and the rest should go outside.

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:13.460
Now, the task [unsure] should be understood.

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:15.460
When you'll become aware of it,

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:19.300
you'll be surprised that God has given you all the powers.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.860
So, try to understand Sahaja Yoga in its essence first.

00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:38.560
And don't try to compete.

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:47.640
Because you can't understand through your mental capacities.

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:58.420
So, one has to reach that state of awareness in which you really can understand and grasp it.

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:01.360
It's something that is eternal.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:15.200
Because a new kind of a revolution is working on via Sahaja Yoga,

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:23.360
which is the truth, actually.

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:31.300
And the truth is such a great mirror

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:36.840
that all that has happened so far in history

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.840
can be seen clearly.

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:49.700
You will know who was right, who was wrong,

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:53.420
what perception was correct what was wrong.

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:59.720
Everything you will know absolutely separately as two compartments.

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:15.540
So, if you- if somebody tells you , this is not good for Sahaja Yoga, don't get upset.

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:27.320
You have willpower because you are young.

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:35.620
You can accept anything. If you accept something, you can practice it in no time.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.440
You are the leaders of the world.

00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:55.360
And you can after [inaudible]

00:39:55.360 --> 00:40:02.120
you have to humbly understand that God has created this universe

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:06.560
and he has given all his powers.

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:19.920
And that he's so All-pervading, that he looks after you at every point and every minute.

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:29.600
As a story, you discover all these things.

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:32.440
It's such a fantastic vision that amazes [inaudible].

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:43.600
There is one little thing, I'll tell you,  that happened then you can't  brain.

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:47.120
I was in Bedford. Do they know the story of Bedford?

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.120
No, Mother.

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:54.480
I was giving a lecture, in front of 5 or 6 hundreds of people, in the town of Bedford.

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:11.680
And then, and a boy felt down, about, at least ten, fifteen miles away from that place.

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:16.700
From a bridge, he felt down from a motorbike.

00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:26.840
And he fainted.

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:33.900
So, people who saw him falling down, they sent for an ambulance.

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:37.960
And the ambulance came to bring him to the hospital.

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:48.420
So, they said: "How is it you're falling so low and you now talk?

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:51.560
what's-  how are you in that case? You're quite fine."

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:08.300
So he said: "Actually, I felt down and a lady in white, an Indian lady in white

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:10.860
came down off her car which was white

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:14.240
and she she touched me all over the body and I got cured.

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:19.520
Except, she left a little part down below, saying that: "You come to me then I 'll cure you."

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:41.580
And the doctors, everybody was so surprised and they published it in a newspaper.

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:51.240
And the second day, he has seen some of my photographs in the newspaper.

00:42:56.280 --> 00:43:01.800
He went into- to people, to police and said: "This is the lady who saved me."

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:11.240
So the newspaper people telephoned to Gavin to find out about me.

00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:26.780
And then Gavin said that: "You can find out from all these people that at that time, and even after that time, Mother was giving a speech in a hall."

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:28.200
Before and after.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:45.760
And they could not explain they don't know about it.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.620
But see the result of that was that the parents got frightened about it.

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:07.200
And the boy never came to see me.

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:11.060
And the people who were there also got frightened.

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:18.480
Frightened, just frightened.

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:25.020
And they, you see, this fright has deviated them from divine life.

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:32.340
There's nothing to be frightened about it.

00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:40.740
Because if the doors of heaven are opening we should enter into it,

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:43.020
we have been waiting for that.

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:52.480
Why should we be afraid or hesitating? Better get in!

00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:00.580
And God is saying: "Aye! [Come in!]"

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:09.280
So we have to enter it so that we enjoy, enjoy because this is what is promised,

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.560
and it's given to you and it's very simple.

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:19.860
Because God as not promised like politicians.

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:26.120
He gives the true promises.

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:31.460
And so, your duty now is to settle down.

00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:44.440
Especially in the West there has been no idea about what spiritual life is.

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:56.360
Even the Christ' life was organized too much and you know what has happened to him.

00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:06.720
So, it's a different area where we are working.

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:14.900
But you are great, great people who are born here.

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:23.600
Because you have to emancipate this ignorant world.

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:30.700
So the responsibility is even much more.

00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:37.020
Indian Sahaja Yogis don't have so much responsibility.

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:45.480
You, people, have the real responsibility and real task.

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:55.020
And as your friends have done it, you can  do it also.

00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:02.600
I'm always with you.

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:05.320
Always.

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:08.780
And I love you very much.

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:13.140
Whatever you want, I'm very ready for giving anything that you ask.

00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:20.720
Just you have to think of it

00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:25.760
and I will be with you.

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:31.860
All the powers of God and all the angels are with you.

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:39.920
You must have faith in yourself

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:45.740
that all is going to work out.

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:50.180
May God bless you all.

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:01.300
Beautiful.

00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:08.900
It's touching me a lot to see you after millions or years. [Unsure]

00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:21.340
I've been waiting for you and you have been waiting for me.

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:28.660
It is such a meeting that you can just not communicate.

00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:36.500
May God bless you all.

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:43.160
and I hope we have a very successful, very, very beautiful session in Paris.

00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:53.860
And a good puja on Saturday morning.

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:01.880
May God bless you.
