08:46.140 --> 08:48.640
And something, it's quite good they said.

08:53.560 --> 08:55.220

09:28.420 --> 09:30.740
He's showing noses of every one. See!

09:36.520 --> 09:39.220
You see, you used to do the same when you were a baby.

09:40.700 --> 09:41.880
Did you do that?

09:43.980 --> 09:45.320
To show noses like this.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.400
Right?

09:52.520 --> 09:53.640
Just look at that now.

10:00.280 --> 10:01.280


10:02.805 --> 10:03.805


10:05.915 --> 10:06.915


10:08.445 --> 10:09.445


10:13.855 --> 10:16.905
The younger ones are interrested in animals, you see

10:16.905 --> 10:17.905


10:24.815 --> 10:25.815


10:28.385 --> 10:29.385


10:31.695 --> 10:32.695


10:33.700 --> 10:36.060
Now he 'll pull your ears better

10:41.580 --> 10:43.540
What are your exams now Robert?

10:43.940 --> 10:45.020
Palmal???

10:45.040 --> 10:46.120
What are your exams?

10:46.600 --> 10:48.680
What are you [inaudible] lots of things?

10:49.180 --> 10:51.740
What subject do you take?

10:51.900 --> 10:55.280
I have to study by heart all the buildings of Europe.

10:55.280 --> 10:55.780
Hum?

10:56.200 --> 10:58.040
All the architecture of Europe.

10:58.040 --> 10:58.720
Ah?

10:59.740 --> 11:04.600
From fourteen hundred till seventeen hundred.

11:06.300 --> 11:07.840
It's interesting!

11:09.675 --> 11:10.675


11:11.580 --> 11:12.080
No

11:14.420 --> 11:16.360
No, it's not mind. I tell you, it's not mind.

11:17.040 --> 11:20.680
Because you read the styles, you know, repeated for years,

11:20.840 --> 11:25.460
The same style [inaudible] school all over the world [inaudible]

11:26.320 --> 11:28.460
Like in India [inaudible] you can

11:28.460 --> 11:30.740
They got their spontaneous people.

11:31.100 --> 11:33.220
They have not formed any styles.

11:33.400 --> 11:34.540
So,

11:35.120 --> 11:38.655
they cannot make it into a from or a style,

11:38.660 --> 11:42.880
or you cannot say this period was a - there is little variation in everything.

11:42.880 --> 11:44.620
It's rather intricate.

11:45.760 --> 11:48.800
I've also a course about Indian art actually.

11:48.800 --> 11:49.635
You have

11:49.640 --> 11:52.680
But it's to study their architects

11:52.680 --> 11:53.600
Hum?

11:53.600 --> 11:54.600


11:55.940 --> 11:58.040
What artists you have in Indian architecture?

11:58.585 --> 11:59.755


12:02.205 --> 12:03.195
Tressano.

12:03.195 --> 12:04.195
Hum?

12:04.360 --> 12:06.220
Trefandro, no?

12:06.400 --> 12:06.900
What did you say?

12:06.900 --> 12:08.900
I didn't study it yet, Mother.

12:08.980 --> 12:14.520
But, you see, we have, I mean, I don't know how you will be studing it but

12:15.620 --> 12:17.875
we had only, to begin with,

12:17.880 --> 12:20.460
we got these Greek people coming in India, you see?

12:21.480 --> 12:24.780
And they started teaching people how to-

12:26.040 --> 12:29.920
They knew only how to hew rocks and make big, big temples and all that.

12:30.680 --> 12:34.540
And then, these people came and started teaching us how to make

12:34.540 --> 12:36.580
houses of big, large,

12:37.620 --> 12:38.880
it's like palaces

12:39.160 --> 12:41.320
We had palaces before also.

12:41.500 --> 12:46.300
But they taught us but the best part of it, they taught us how to hew  the rock also.

12:46.520 --> 12:49.900
And in that they wanted Buddha to look like a Greek, you see.

12:49.900 --> 12:51.420
So, they gave him mustaches

12:51.920 --> 12:53.660
and also gave him shoes, you see.

12:53.820 --> 12:58.240
And the nose of Buddha is just like a Greek nose, you know, starting from here

12:58.240 --> 13:00.195
straight down here, like that.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.100
Not like an Indian one

13:02.260 --> 13:05.700
And Buddha sitting with his shoes on, imagine, with a mustache

13:06.660 --> 13:07.660


13:07.800 --> 13:08.800


13:10.960 --> 13:13.460
And wearing the same type of a dress

13:13.465 --> 13:16.165
you know that Greek cloth without any stitching,

13:16.165 --> 13:17.300
what did you call that?

13:17.520 --> 13:18.340
A toge.

13:18.340 --> 13:19.220
Ah.

13:19.220 --> 13:23.020
And the hairs' style, we call it "linger shigary" in Sanskrit.

13:23.200 --> 13:27.480
And same type of hair style that

13:27.580 --> 13:30.440
they wore at that time. They gave it to him,

13:30.540 --> 13:31.540
that Buddha

13:32.140 --> 13:33.140


13:35.860 --> 13:38.395
But they had rapports from India

13:38.400 --> 13:40.160
long, long time, thousand of years back.

13:40.240 --> 13:43.780
Because, when I asked them: "Are you ready to call this bona saker?"

13:44.140 --> 13:46.240
They said: "We had a rapport from India.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.780
for long, long, time." Say,

13:49.400 --> 13:50.600
They said about

13:51.380 --> 13:53.860
six, seven thousands years back.

13:54.320 --> 13:58.920
And I think it questions the time when Rama's children, both of them, Lav and Kush,

13:58.920 --> 13:59.720
went to

14:00.475 --> 14:02.065
one went to China

14:02.540 --> 14:07.000
and another went to the slave country

14:07.520 --> 14:09.540
The "slave" word comes from "se-ga"

14:10.180 --> 14:13.020
Lav was one of the name for a lamasya.

14:13.180 --> 14:14.280
Slav.

14:14.580 --> 14:16.720
"Se" means "with"

14:17.660 --> 14:20.700
"Lav" was one day, one of the "Kashapas"  [unsure]

14:21.060 --> 14:22.660


14:22.660 --> 14:27.440
So that's why the Chineses are called as Kushan, you see?

14:28.060 --> 14:29.780
They are called as Kushan.

14:31.760 --> 14:34.040
Because he was Kush, imagine!

14:34.080 --> 14:37.060
And this must be thousands of years back. And that was the source.

14:37.060 --> 14:41.380
Even now, they say [inaudible].

14:41.920 --> 14:47.720
It's close, there is a temple of Indulika (?) Devi, one of the Goddesses there.

14:48.400 --> 14:49.400
Shilde  [unsure].

14:50.260 --> 14:52.940
It's very interesting.

14:55.940 --> 14:57.700
Alexander came much later.

14:58.060 --> 14:59.060


15:06.520 --> 15:07.520
He's happy with it.

15:10.020 --> 15:11.360
They are the same children.

15:13.040 --> 15:14.040


15:14.785 --> 15:15.785


15:24.825 --> 15:27.245


15:27.705 --> 15:28.705


15:29.185 --> 15:30.185


15:35.655 --> 15:36.655


15:39.365 --> 15:40.365


15:43.840 --> 15:47.460
A little one. Thank you.

15:52.400 --> 15:53.900
There's a fragrance actually.

15:57.380 --> 15:58.380


16:00.385 --> 16:01.385


16:11.465 --> 16:12.465


16:16.935 --> 16:17.935


16:20.680 --> 16:26.760
They are all now going to America, Sahaja Yogis, those who are [?] they are all trying to go.

16:27.140 --> 16:30.740
Some are going [?] and some are going [?]

16:30.740 --> 16:32.900
some are going to [?] some to Los Angeles

16:33.100 --> 16:34.800
and some to San Francisco.

16:34.800 --> 16:39.380
We are all trying to see that they are there to  [?] the work out.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.200
Let's see what happens.

16:42.980 --> 16:45.160


16:45.260 --> 16:47.980


16:48.220 --> 16:49.800
That would be a very good idea.

16:50.300 --> 16:53.280


16:53.280 --> 16:54.900
Very good idea, very good idea.

16:55.960 --> 16:57.660
You see, actually,

16:57.995 --> 16:58.995


16:59.795 --> 17:02.365


17:03.180 --> 17:05.520
You see, postering and all that has to be done,

17:05.520 --> 17:07.520
apart from that,

17:08.900 --> 17:09.900


17:10.475 --> 17:11.805
[?]

17:13.575 --> 17:14.575
[?]

17:15.105 --> 17:18.035
broadcasting from, I saw TV and everything

17:20.340 --> 17:23.460
from this place, what you call [?]

17:24.400 --> 17:27.360
Then, once it is done, then they say: "that thing will work out."

17:30.940 --> 17:34.480
If that happens, then it will be better

17:35.380 --> 17:38.800
that we can really manage everything. [?] also.

17:39.100 --> 17:42.800
Because newspaper's people are extremely difficult.

17:47.035 --> 17:49.935
Newspaper in New York especially.

17:52.365 --> 17:53.895
Very funny ideas.

17:58.920 --> 17:59.640
Mother?

17:59.640 --> 18:00.380
Hugh.

18:00.380 --> 18:05.020
Will it be possible to stay in some Sahaja Yogi's house if we go there?

18:05.120 --> 18:07.200
Yes, I think so if you can arrange.

18:10.840 --> 18:13.460
We should. We should be able to.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.540
They are all working but we don't have so many.

18:17.140 --> 18:22.000
Actually, there is another thig working out  [?], you see, Modi is going.

18:22.600 --> 18:26.000
He's going to take one house and hire it.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.240


18:29.005 --> 18:30.005


18:31.220 --> 18:36.940
And which town would you prefer us to do, Mother? Which part of America you would prefer us to go?

18:37.200 --> 18:40.280
Anywhere, I mean, anywhere.

18:40.520 --> 18:44.060
But, because New York is the worst of all, so more people-

18:44.160 --> 18:46.200
So, New York.

18:48.360 --> 18:49.760
Catherine settled here.

18:49.980 --> 18:52.200
She's so fed up now.

18:52.340 --> 18:57.920
In one of her letter she writes: "if you come to me, and then we just tell them a little thing that they hear all truth

18:57.920 --> 18:59.580
they get angry.

18:59.860 --> 19:03.860
You tell them anything, you see, they have preconceived ideas, they'll say: "No, no, you can't get Realization like that.

19:03.980 --> 19:07.215
How do you say?" All this, they have so much overread

19:07.220 --> 19:10.560
and there have so many people in their heads, that it's impossible."

19:12.280 --> 19:15.140
We have a good experience of that in Paris already, Mother.

19:15.160 --> 19:15.660
Right.

19:15.660 --> 19:16.480
Is it?

19:16.980 --> 19:19.940
She said they are very clever.

19:20.185 --> 19:22.855
[Inaudible]

19:24.675 --> 19:25.675


19:28.800 --> 19:32.460
She said they are not yet exposed to truth at all.

19:33.860 --> 19:37.800
For them it's like to do shopping, there are going from one place to another like that.

19:40.740 --> 19:45.560
But, in other places it has worked, you see, so it should work in America also.

19:45.860 --> 19:49.500
We have to approve the right type of people, that I don’t know what to do.

19:49.580 --> 19:54.840
But once there is a good broadcast, I think, people will start thinking about it.

19:55.500 --> 19:58.860
If they hear Me, they’ll start thinking about it.

20:02.560 --> 20:06.280
I gave him some nice- did you write there what I said?

20:06.840 --> 20:08.380
Yes Mother.

20:08.380 --> 20:08.980
Yes

20:09.220 --> 20:10.900
Can you do that?

20:10.900 --> 20:12.180
I don’t have it with me, Mother.

20:12.220 --> 20:13.000
No, no, no.

20:16.780 --> 20:17.780


20:18.540 --> 20:20.460
You should arrange something

20:21.440 --> 20:23.400
for people to go there.

20:23.560 --> 20:27.120
Aunty Christine has a house then that Herman has a house.

20:27.580 --> 20:29.220
[inaudible] has houses.

20:29.940 --> 20:33.600
And also you can take a house and hire it.

20:34.140 --> 20:37.140
As Modi is going, he is taking a house on a rent.

20:44.860 --> 20:47.700
Modi is a very dynamic person, no doubt.

20:48.020 --> 20:51.040
But, how far he will be successful in America? You can’t say.

20:51.220 --> 20:54.140
But his presence there might help a lot, I think.

20:54.140 --> 20:55.140
Yes Mother.

20:55.380 --> 20:59.340
It will help the Sahaja Yogis to keep Spirit-self.

20:59.340 --> 21:00.920
Definitely.

21:00.920 --> 21:02.240
Yes, definitely.

21:03.520 --> 21:08.600
Apart from that, you see, there are a lot of Gujaratis and he thinks that he can bring them round.

21:08.680 --> 21:10.980
How many Indians there are, I don’t know.

21:11.200 --> 21:16.120
But he thinks so, that he might be able to speak to them and bring them round.

21:18.160 --> 21:23.960
But lots of false gurus have left there,  [inaudible]

21:25.760 --> 21:28.000
they have now gone to Los Angeles.

21:28.340 --> 21:30.560
So the people are carrying on with this.

21:31.635 --> 21:34.485
Those gurus are dead now,

21:34.565 --> 21:37.275
they are lost in- they are no more in Los Angeles,

21:37.800 --> 21:42.380
but these people are still having their [inaudible].

21:43.620 --> 21:45.520
They can't forget these gurus.

21:46.240 --> 21:48.820
You see, for them, now it has just become prestigious.

21:50.895 --> 21:52.755
what to do?

21:54.180 --> 21:57.460
So forget a guru means a prestigious thing.

22:00.880 --> 22:01.880


22:03.315 --> 22:04.435


22:09.845 --> 22:10.845


22:10.940 --> 22:17.600
Dany went there, I mean, they are all, Macha, Dany, then Christine, her husband

22:17.660 --> 22:20.060
now working in New York.

22:21.500 --> 22:22.900


22:29.160 --> 22:32.800
Last time, we did a lot; working as much as possible.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.020
But nobody used.

22:35.600 --> 22:38.700
You see, when I go there, definitely people  come, no doubt.

22:38.900 --> 22:44.160
Even in New York, we had a lot of them,  sometimes about [inaudible], sometimes unveiled

22:44.440 --> 22:47.040
to two hundred people [inaudible]

22:48.680 --> 22:51.400
Rosenwald, there were five hundred, six hundred people,

22:51.960 --> 22:54.840
but they think it's a lot as they were telling me.

22:57.060 --> 22:58.060
Hello!

22:58.180 --> 22:59.400
Yes, yes!

22:59.960 --> 23:00.940


23:00.940 --> 23:01.880


23:01.880 --> 23:05.000
Mother, some people have arrived from France, Christine.

23:06.240 --> 23:07.240
Hello!

23:07.500 --> 23:08.700
From Mulhouse.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.620
From Mulhouse and some other girls.

23:13.100 --> 23:17.420
I think the old people should go out and let the new people come in.

23:17.420 --> 23:18.340
All right, Mother.

23:19.260 --> 23:21.880
Mother, elder children from Paris?

23:22.300 --> 23:24.620
Mother, you remember Jean-Yves?

23:24.975 --> 23:27.275
Yes, yes.

23:29.495 --> 23:30.495


23:30.595 --> 23:31.595


23:32.325 --> 23:33.325


23:39.585 --> 23:40.585


23:50.015 --> 23:51.135


23:53.920 --> 23:54.920


23:55.960 --> 24:00.660
So the new people seem to be much more solid

24:00.660 --> 24:01.160


24:01.360 --> 24:02.500
Yes, Mother.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000


24:07.455 --> 24:08.455


24:10.560 --> 24:11.880
So how are you?

24:13.800 --> 24:15.260


24:17.700 --> 24:18.700


24:18.760 --> 24:22.300
And there's a lot of now sunshine in France.

24:22.840 --> 24:27.560
There's a lot of bright future for France.

24:27.585 --> 24:30.765


24:31.135 --> 24:32.135


24:32.800 --> 24:33.800


24:38.860 --> 24:47.260
French people are taking to a lot of sad solutions because they thought they had no solution.

24:47.600 --> 24:50.800


24:51.135 --> 24:52.675


24:54.340 --> 25:01.640
Because they did not know that there is something very great awaiting above minds.

25:08.360 --> 25:13.480
And they indulge into all these things very much.

25:16.460 --> 25:20.580
But they must know that God has created this world

25:20.580 --> 25:23.220
and that he’s going to look after you.

25:27.920 --> 25:30.560
He’s going to bless us.

25:31.220 --> 25:34.860
He’s going to give us all that is born of you and beautiful.

25:38.360 --> 25:40.080
The time has come.

25:41.180 --> 25:45.360
And it’s for you all now to decide that it is God’s work

25:45.960 --> 25:50.000
and how much you must dedicate

25:50.280 --> 25:52.040


25:52.280 --> 25:54.580


25:55.545 --> 25:56.955


25:57.600 --> 25:59.780


26:00.860 --> 26:06.540
It’s going to work for your forefathers because there will be blessed as they have given you life

26:07.300 --> 26:10.280
and for your progenesis.

26:10.560 --> 26:11.560


26:11.865 --> 26:15.185


26:15.185 --> 26:16.445


26:22.145 --> 26:23.145


26:25.105 --> 26:26.105


26:26.725 --> 26:29.195


26:29.705 --> 26:30.705


26:33.055 --> 26:34.055


26:34.275 --> 26:35.275


26:36.015 --> 26:37.825


26:38.315 --> 26:41.415


26:41.415 --> 26:42.415


26:42.880 --> 26:44.860


26:46.740 --> 26:48.400
French language is small.

26:50.040 --> 26:51.040


26:51.205 --> 26:52.205


26:58.120 --> 26:59.120
French language is very short.

27:01.660 --> 27:06.320
So, now it is your responsibility,

27:07.420 --> 27:09.980
it is a very great responsibility.

27:14.940 --> 27:18.800
The world is standing at a very grave position

27:20.300 --> 27:23.580


27:24.700 --> 27:25.700


27:25.780 --> 27:32.660
because stupid people are using this world for a game

27:34.320 --> 27:35.820
and to play with it.

27:36.140 --> 27:38.840
And then to destroy it.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.220


27:44.140 --> 27:45.140


27:48.020 --> 27:51.120
So, it is for you to know what is false, what is real.

27:51.860 --> 27:55.300


27:55.440 --> 27:59.100
And then you have to, after knowing it,

27:59.100 --> 28:01.140
you have to master the art.

28:01.200 --> 28:03.840


28:04.060 --> 28:06.140


28:06.980 --> 28:09.980
And then, you have to spread it to others.

28:09.980 --> 28:12.020


28:13.260 --> 28:15.940
It’s only you who can make them masters.

28:15.940 --> 28:17.040


28:17.720 --> 28:19.420


28:22.300 --> 28:24.380
And I’m sure it will spread like fire.

28:24.920 --> 28:27.620


28:27.625 --> 28:28.975


28:30.205 --> 28:31.205


28:33.000 --> 28:38.100
It’s for every place, every place, not only about France, it’s every place.

28:40.280 --> 28:41.360


28:42.760 --> 28:47.320
Robert seems to be very unhappy about Germans' case already.

28:48.220 --> 28:51.540
But even, it should happen just trust Me,  I know.

28:51.560 --> 28:53.320


28:54.180 --> 28:57.160


28:57.540 --> 29:00.660
We are gathering forces in Germany too.

29:04.140 --> 29:08.480
You see, once the Germans take to Sahaja Yoga, then nobody can stop it.

29:11.100 --> 29:14.020


29:14.520 --> 29:17.580


29:17.580 --> 29:22.020
They have still some funny ideas which will drop out by themselves.

29:22.020 --> 29:24.695


29:24.695 --> 29:25.575


29:25.580 --> 29:27.100


29:29.680 --> 29:34.640
There are lots of Rajneesh disciples in Germany, lots.

29:34.640 --> 29:35.760


29:36.095 --> 29:37.105


29:37.560 --> 29:40.560


29:41.520 --> 29:44.540
And now, he is in a mess himself you see.

29:44.660 --> 29:47.020
He has to get out of America.

29:47.120 --> 29:49.080
He can’t talk.

29:49.240 --> 29:53.120
Because his voice is finished, he cannot talk

29:53.280 --> 29:58.740
And they are trying to make out a case out of it.

29:59.220 --> 30:02.500
But he cannot talk. So, they say he is not teaching.

30:02.860 --> 30:05.440
A person who cannot talk, how can he be a teacher?

30:05.620 --> 30:08.655


30:08.655 --> 30:12.025


30:12.275 --> 30:13.275


30:13.275 --> 30:16.525


30:17.105 --> 30:20.175


30:20.180 --> 30:21.780


30:22.100 --> 30:27.920
So, they have to- I mean they have decided to throw him out.

30:27.920 --> 30:30.680


30:30.680 --> 30:34.620
And once he goes out in that way and he is absolutely exposed,

30:35.840 --> 30:39.160
then it might be that the people will turn right.

30:39.160 --> 30:40.900


30:41.485 --> 30:44.785


30:45.020 --> 30:48.420


30:49.780 --> 30:54.780
Of course, they can twist up many things by saying that

30:54.960 --> 30:58.140
he had been tortured and he is Christ crucified.

30:58.140 --> 30:59.860


31:00.765 --> 31:03.995


31:04.500 --> 31:05.520


31:07.560 --> 31:10.835
Lots of things are working out.

31:14.100 --> 31:18.240
Like this new disease that has come now, AIDS, in America.

31:18.240 --> 31:21.300


31:21.680 --> 31:23.080


31:23.880 --> 31:28.940
I heard in England that ten thousands of people are suffering from that.

31:28.940 --> 31:31.500


31:31.765 --> 31:33.235


31:33.865 --> 31:36.575


31:36.575 --> 31:37.855


31:40.060 --> 31:41.060


31:41.840 --> 31:44.080
But, just imagine,

31:44.640 --> 31:49.320
fifty years back, people were eating very [inaudible]

31:49.580 --> 31:52.860
they probably suffered but nobody had cancer, nobody knew about it.

31:53.040 --> 31:56.275


31:56.275 --> 31:59.055


31:59.060 --> 32:01.925


32:01.925 --> 32:04.420
All kind of funny diseases,

32:04.420 --> 32:08.300
like when they give estrogen to a chicken.

32:08.300 --> 32:08.800


32:09.040 --> 32:12.820
Those who eat that chicken you get puberty at a very young age,  one year earlier.

32:14.220 --> 32:17.220


32:17.325 --> 32:20.265


32:20.265 --> 32:23.225


32:23.225 --> 32:26.325


32:26.325 --> 32:29.240


32:29.400 --> 32:33.080
And there's one boy, at 18 years of age,  I saw him,

32:33.100 --> 32:37.620
he got breast and half body like man and half like woman.

32:37.840 --> 32:40.595


32:40.595 --> 32:43.355


32:43.360 --> 32:44.700


32:44.700 --> 32:47.840
So this is so shocking.

32:48.380 --> 32:54.120
So by saying: "What's wrong. We can do what we like"

32:54.120 --> 32:56.380


32:56.560 --> 32:59.520
all that is coming to an end now.

32:59.520 --> 33:01.520


33:01.520 --> 33:05.340
And Sahaja Yogis also should be very careful when they use all these medicines

33:05.340 --> 33:09.660
as far as the- what you call- the chemical are concerned.

33:10.220 --> 33:12.520
Not very strong medicines.

33:12.520 --> 33:14.660


33:15.455 --> 33:18.255


33:18.375 --> 33:21.455


33:21.460 --> 33:23.700


33:24.040 --> 33:27.560
Try to use simple things.

33:27.840 --> 33:30.500


33:30.500 --> 33:33.960
You don't really need much because you are all Realized souls.

33:33.960 --> 33:36.895


33:38.140 --> 33:42.840
If you know how to master art of Realization, you don't need so much drugs  [unsure].

33:42.980 --> 33:46.035


33:46.040 --> 33:49.040


33:49.560 --> 33:56.140
But, I mean, in case you're getting some troubles also or something chemical, be careful what you use.

33:56.340 --> 33:59.435


33:59.440 --> 34:00.580


34:00.920 --> 34:06.400
Even the toothpate and all little things that  if you use for day-to-day life, you have to be careful.

34:06.820 --> 34:07.820


34:07.865 --> 34:10.765


34:11.105 --> 34:14.075


34:14.080 --> 34:16.400


34:16.400 --> 34:20.420
Actually, I'm trying to test may things just to see how it is reacting.

34:20.420 --> 34:23.480


34:23.480 --> 34:24.480


34:24.760 --> 34:29.220
So that you people don't suffer with the after effects.

34:29.220 --> 34:30.940


34:31.020 --> 34:32.940


34:33.660 --> 34:37.160
And so we will send you a circular to all of you here

34:37.340 --> 34:40.560
to know what is to be used for soap, for this and that.

34:42.360 --> 34:44.980


34:44.980 --> 34:46.060


34:47.620 --> 34:51.640
And also, I'm very happy that I could meet all the new people over here.

34:52.040 --> 34:54.675


34:54.675 --> 34:57.185


34:57.185 --> 34:59.955


35:00.195 --> 35:01.235


35:01.775 --> 35:02.775


35:03.135 --> 35:05.385
Martine, Mother comes from Strasbourg.

35:06.120 --> 35:09.820
Martine and that's her mother, Indu,

35:12.060 --> 35:13.060


35:17.505 --> 35:18.905
Philippe, from Rouen.

35:21.515 --> 35:23.905
Patrick from Bordeaux.

35:28.420 --> 35:31.280
Sylvie from Toulouse.

35:31.360 --> 35:33.140
No, Mulhouse.

35:33.140 --> 35:34.180
Sorry.

35:34.180 --> 35:37.880
Then Alain,

35:39.680 --> 35:41.520
from Mulhouse also.

35:42.560 --> 35:43.540


35:44.240 --> 35:48.060
She's taking care of them, Mother, Christine is taking care of them.

35:48.060 --> 35:49.000


35:49.460 --> 35:51.160
Jean-Pierre.

35:53.060 --> 35:54.340
Bernadette.

35:55.940 --> 35:58.260
Cécile.

35:59.760 --> 36:01.060
Bernadette.

36:03.120 --> 36:04.420
Mulhouse also.

36:06.580 --> 36:08.540
So nice to see you all here.

36:08.540 --> 36:10.180
Some more.

36:10.180 --> 36:11.180


36:11.400 --> 36:12.740


36:17.160 --> 36:19.580
Nicole

36:22.760 --> 36:26.240


36:26.240 --> 36:28.620
Lausanne Mother.

36:30.560 --> 36:33.520
And Joël, he has not come.

36:33.520 --> 36:36.260


36:39.400 --> 36:44.760
I would say that for those who have come for the first time should sit inside and the rest should go outside.

36:45.540 --> 36:48.435


36:48.435 --> 36:49.815


36:53.085 --> 36:55.915


36:59.685 --> 37:00.685


37:00.720 --> 37:03.280


37:09.140 --> 37:13.460
Now, the task [unsure] should be understood.

37:13.460 --> 37:15.460
When you'll become aware of it,

37:15.460 --> 37:19.300
you'll be surprised that God has given you all the powers.

37:20.240 --> 37:21.240


37:21.925 --> 37:23.095


37:23.900 --> 37:26.800


37:27.000 --> 37:32.860
So, try to understand Sahaja Yoga in its essence first.

37:33.800 --> 37:36.420


37:36.620 --> 37:38.560
And don't try to compete.

37:39.020 --> 37:40.540


37:41.260 --> 37:43.840


37:43.840 --> 37:47.640
Because you can't understand through your mental capacities.

37:47.900 --> 37:50.775


37:50.780 --> 37:51.780


37:52.420 --> 37:58.420
So, one has to reach that state of awareness in which you really can understand and grasp it.

37:58.520 --> 37:59.520


37:59.740 --> 38:01.360
It's something that is eternal.

38:01.420 --> 38:04.335


38:04.335 --> 38:07.385


38:07.385 --> 38:09.680


38:09.920 --> 38:15.200
Because a new kind of a revolution is working on via Sahaja Yoga,

38:15.380 --> 38:18.080


38:18.080 --> 38:21.080


38:21.460 --> 38:23.360
which is the truth, actually.

38:23.360 --> 38:25.180


38:25.180 --> 38:31.300
And the truth is such a great mirror

38:31.960 --> 38:36.840
that all that has happened so far in history

38:36.840 --> 38:38.840
can be seen clearly.

38:39.360 --> 38:41.960


38:41.960 --> 38:44.980


38:44.980 --> 38:46.340


38:46.760 --> 38:49.700
You will know who was right, who was wrong,

38:50.400 --> 38:53.420
what perception was correct what was wrong.

38:53.420 --> 38:59.720
Everything you will know absolutely separately as two compartments.

39:00.480 --> 39:03.635


39:03.635 --> 39:07.095


39:07.100 --> 39:09.680


39:09.680 --> 39:10.820


39:10.820 --> 39:15.540
So, if you- if somebody tells you , this is not good for Sahaja Yoga, don't get upset.

39:15.540 --> 39:16.880


39:16.880 --> 39:19.335


39:19.335 --> 39:21.975


39:21.980 --> 39:23.700


39:24.160 --> 39:27.320
You have willpower because you are young.

39:27.580 --> 39:35.620
You can accept anything. If you accept something, you can practice it in no time.

39:41.280 --> 39:43.200


39:43.920 --> 39:46.440
You are the leaders of the world.

39:46.500 --> 39:49.515


39:49.520 --> 39:50.520


39:51.820 --> 39:55.360
And you can after [inaudible]

39:55.360 --> 40:02.120
you have to humbly understand that God has created this universe

40:03.220 --> 40:06.560
and he has given all his powers.

40:09.680 --> 40:11.040


40:11.380 --> 40:12.460


40:13.600 --> 40:19.920
And that he's so All-pervading, that he looks after you at every point and every minute.

40:19.920 --> 40:23.095


40:23.100 --> 40:24.720


40:26.100 --> 40:29.600
As a story, you discover all these things.

40:29.600 --> 40:32.440
It's such a fantastic vision that amazes [inaudible].

40:32.760 --> 40:36.015


40:36.020 --> 40:37.540


40:39.400 --> 40:43.600
There is one little thing, I'll tell you,  that happened then you can't  brain.

40:44.240 --> 40:47.120
I was in Bedford. Do they know the story of Bedford?

40:47.360 --> 40:48.120
No, Mother.

40:48.320 --> 40:54.480
I was giving a lecture, in front of 5 or 6 hundreds of people, in the town of Bedford.

40:57.500 --> 41:00.680


41:00.685 --> 41:01.685


41:02.135 --> 41:03.865


41:04.180 --> 41:11.680
And then, and a boy felt down, about, at least ten, fifteen miles away from that place.

41:11.960 --> 41:16.700
From a bridge, he felt down from a motorbike.

41:16.900 --> 41:17.600


41:17.600 --> 41:20.600


41:20.600 --> 41:22.080


41:24.460 --> 41:26.840
And he fainted.

41:27.360 --> 41:33.900
So, people who saw him falling down, they sent for an ambulance.

41:34.540 --> 41:37.960
And the ambulance came to bring him to the hospital.

41:37.960 --> 41:39.880


41:39.885 --> 41:42.005


41:42.005 --> 41:44.300


41:44.300 --> 41:48.420
So, they said: "How is it you're falling so low and you now talk?

41:48.600 --> 41:51.560
what's-  how are you in that case? You're quite fine."

41:56.180 --> 41:58.620


41:58.620 --> 42:01.440


42:01.640 --> 42:08.300
So he said: "Actually, I felt down and a lady in white, an Indian lady in white

42:08.500 --> 42:10.860
came down off her car which was white

42:10.860 --> 42:14.240
and she she touched me all over the body and I got cured.

42:14.880 --> 42:19.520
Except, she left a little part down below, saying that: "You come to me then I 'll cure you."

42:19.680 --> 42:20.680


42:21.875 --> 42:24.025


42:24.025 --> 42:26.935


42:26.935 --> 42:30.255


42:30.255 --> 42:33.045


42:33.045 --> 42:36.055


42:36.060 --> 42:37.060


42:37.340 --> 42:41.580
And the doctors, everybody was so surprised and they published it in a newspaper.

42:42.280 --> 42:45.005


42:45.005 --> 42:46.860


42:46.920 --> 42:51.240
And the second day, he has seen some of my photographs in the newspaper.

42:51.240 --> 42:53.660


42:53.680 --> 42:56.280


42:56.280 --> 43:01.800
He went into- to people, to police and said: "This is the lady who saved me."

43:02.820 --> 43:05.900


43:06.620 --> 43:11.240
So the newspaper people telephoned to Gavin to find out about me.

43:12.280 --> 43:15.140


43:15.300 --> 43:17.580


43:18.020 --> 43:26.780
And then Gavin said that: "You can find out from all these people that at that time, and even after that time, Mother was giving a speech in a hall."

43:27.040 --> 43:28.200
Before and after.

43:28.200 --> 43:31.280


43:31.285 --> 43:34.545


43:34.545 --> 43:37.825


43:37.825 --> 43:40.960


43:41.280 --> 43:45.760
And they could not explain they don't know about it.

43:49.860 --> 43:52.260


43:53.000 --> 43:57.620
But see the result of that was that the parents got frightened about it.

43:58.100 --> 44:00.560


44:00.820 --> 44:03.595


44:03.600 --> 44:07.200
And the boy never came to see me.

44:07.400 --> 44:11.060
And the people who were there also got frightened.

44:11.060 --> 44:11.765


44:11.765 --> 44:14.265


44:15.840 --> 44:16.840


44:16.860 --> 44:18.480
Frightened, just frightened.

44:18.520 --> 44:25.020
And they, you see, this fright has deviated them from divine life.

44:25.400 --> 44:28.400


44:28.400 --> 44:29.880


44:29.880 --> 44:32.340
There's nothing to be frightened about it.

44:32.540 --> 44:35.120


44:35.120 --> 44:36.420


44:36.820 --> 44:40.740
Because if the doors of heaven are opening we should enter into it,

44:40.740 --> 44:43.020
we have been waiting for that.

44:45.160 --> 44:48.295


44:48.300 --> 44:52.480
Why should we be afraid or hesitating? Better get in!

44:53.160 --> 44:56.565


44:56.565 --> 44:57.520


44:57.520 --> 45:00.580
And God is saying: "Aye! [Come in!]"

45:00.580 --> 45:01.760


45:03.200 --> 45:09.280
So we have to enter it so that we enjoy, enjoy because this is what is promised,

45:09.480 --> 45:11.560
and it's given to you and it's very simple.

45:13.160 --> 45:16.360


45:16.580 --> 45:19.860
Because God as not promised like politicians.

45:20.300 --> 45:23.520


45:23.960 --> 45:26.120
He gives the true promises.

45:26.120 --> 45:28.280


45:28.280 --> 45:31.460
And so, your duty now is to settle down.

45:32.240 --> 45:35.460


45:35.480 --> 45:38.060


45:38.060 --> 45:44.440
Especially in the West there has been no idea about what spiritual life is.

45:44.880 --> 45:47.755


45:47.760 --> 45:50.760


45:51.180 --> 45:56.360
Even the Christ' life was organized too much and you know what has happened to him.

45:56.360 --> 45:59.320


45:59.325 --> 46:01.655


46:01.660 --> 46:02.860


46:03.820 --> 46:06.720
So, it's a different area where we are working.

46:07.100 --> 46:10.240


46:10.240 --> 46:11.520


46:11.520 --> 46:14.900
But you are great, great people who are born here.

46:15.140 --> 46:17.815


46:17.820 --> 46:19.960


46:20.640 --> 46:23.600
Because you have to emancipate this ignorant world.

46:23.600 --> 46:26.515


46:26.520 --> 46:28.060


46:28.080 --> 46:30.700
So the responsibility is even much more.

46:31.360 --> 46:33.940


46:33.940 --> 46:37.020
Indian Sahaja Yogis don't have so much responsibility.

46:37.380 --> 46:40.360


46:40.360 --> 46:41.380


46:41.380 --> 46:45.480
You, people, have the real responsibility and real task.

46:45.600 --> 46:48.700


46:48.700 --> 46:50.260


46:50.260 --> 46:55.020
And as your friends have done it, you can  do it also.

46:55.120 --> 46:56.780


46:57.180 --> 46:59.300


46:59.800 --> 47:02.600
I'm always with you.

47:03.820 --> 47:05.320
Always.

47:05.780 --> 47:08.780
And I love you very much.

47:09.120 --> 47:13.140
Whatever you want, I'm very ready for giving anything that you ask.

47:13.480 --> 47:14.480


47:14.920 --> 47:17.940


47:18.840 --> 47:20.720
Just you have to think of it

47:21.300 --> 47:22.640


47:23.520 --> 47:25.760
and I will be with you.

47:26.680 --> 47:31.860
All the powers of God and all the angels are with you.

47:32.580 --> 47:35.300


47:35.300 --> 47:36.880


47:37.200 --> 47:39.920
You must have faith in yourself

47:39.920 --> 47:40.920


47:42.480 --> 47:45.740
that all is going to work out.

47:45.740 --> 47:46.340


47:46.880 --> 47:47.880


47:48.960 --> 47:50.180
May God bless you all.

47:59.840 --> 48:01.300
Beautiful.

48:05.720 --> 48:08.900
It's touching me a lot to see you after millions or years. [Unsure]

48:09.020 --> 48:11.060


48:11.440 --> 48:14.320


48:14.320 --> 48:16.580


48:17.320 --> 48:21.340
I've been waiting for you and you have been waiting for me.

48:21.340 --> 48:22.440


48:22.840 --> 48:24.040


48:24.940 --> 48:28.660
It is such a meeting that you can just not communicate.

48:30.660 --> 48:31.660


48:32.480 --> 48:33.480


48:34.360 --> 48:36.500
May God bless you all.

48:36.960 --> 48:43.160
and I hope we have a very successful, very, very beautiful session in Paris.

48:43.320 --> 48:46.620


48:46.745 --> 48:47.745


48:48.080 --> 48:51.200


48:51.780 --> 48:53.860
And a good puja on Saturday morning.

48:54.660 --> 48:57.635


48:57.640 --> 48:58.960


48:59.800 --> 49:01.880
May God bless you.

49:13.260 --> 49:14.120


49:14.125 --> 49:16.175
