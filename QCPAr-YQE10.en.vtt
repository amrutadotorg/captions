The Beauty That You

01:43.560 --> 01:50.560
Are
October 5, 1981

01:52.480 --> 01:59.480
Public Program, Houston, Texas, USA

02:07.180 --> 02:14.180
Yesterday I told you that God has created
us with a purpose and unless and until we

02:22.590 --> 02:29.490
find out our purpose, unless and until we
find out our absolute, we are going to seek

02:29.490 --> 02:36.490
and we are not going to be happy. He has done
everything, very beautifully. Now we should

02:38.430 --> 02:40.620
understand what are we really, inside.

02:40.620 --> 02:47.620
Moreover, as I explained to you yesterday,
that whatever I say is to be taken as a hypothesis,

02:48.959 --> 02:55.720
as a scientist who would keep his mind open
and see for himself, because everything is

02:55.720 --> 03:02.720
not known to you. And whatever I say, you
have to keep your mind open, you need not

03:02.970 --> 03:09.970
accept Me blindly because blind faith is of
no use. But, if you get your enlightenment,

03:12.620 --> 03:19.620
you get your Self-realization, you actualize
it, you become, then you have to verify for

03:20.260 --> 03:24.770
yourself whatever I say, is it true or not?

03:24.770 --> 03:31.770
For example, if I say that the Christ, our
Lord, is placed in this center of ours, at

03:33.760 --> 03:39.700
the Agnya Chakra, which I’ll explain to
you in details. You are not to believe Me

03:39.700 --> 03:46.700
that He’s placed there, but you have to
see for yourself when you get your realization,

03:49.340 --> 03:53.910
you will be able to raise the Kundalini of
other people. And when you start raising the

03:53.910 --> 03:57.570
Kundalini you will find that it will stop
at this point – because you will become

03:57.570 --> 04:04.570
your own gurus, the Kundalini will move at
your fingers, and then when you find the Kundalini

04:05.900 --> 04:12.900
has stopped here you’ll be amazed that you
will have to ask the seeker or the subject

04:14.680 --> 04:21.130
to say the Lord’s Prayer. And that’s the
only way you can get out the Kundalini from

04:21.130 --> 04:28.130
that center. It’s a mantra. It’s a mantra,
it’s a chanting, which was given to us.

04:30.740 --> 04:37.740
He could have given the bija mantra, the seed
of that chanting is Ham-ksham. But, He didn’t

04:38.080 --> 04:44.520
give because He thought people would be, specially
Christians would be very rational people,

04:44.520 --> 04:51.100
so He thought better give a complete explanation
of the whole thing. But every word of it is

04:51.100 --> 04:58.100
a mantra. But it is to be awakened; if it
is not awakened, it’s dead. It is to be

04:58.600 --> 05:01.570
awakened, this is the basis of Sahaj Yoga.

05:01.570 --> 05:06.349
“Saha” is “born.” With you, Saha-ja.
“Ja” means “born” and “Saha” is

05:06.349 --> 05:10.180
“with” – is born with you, spontaneous,
it’s living process within you, is your

05:10.180 --> 05:10.890
own right, you must have it.

05:10.890 --> 05:17.890
So this is a living process and the living
happening should take place. You should become

05:20.240 --> 05:26.220
your absolute; you should become your own
guru; you should get complete integration

05:26.220 --> 05:31.690
within yourself; and then you will be able
to discriminate because the all-pervading

05:31.690 --> 05:38.690
Power, about which I told you yesterday, is
surrounding, is everywhere, only you are to

05:38.840 --> 05:45.840
be awakened; once you are awakened you can
start feeling them, the existence of that,

05:46.060 --> 05:53.060
around you, on your fingers. Imagine on your
fingers you start feeling that Cool Breeze

05:54.850 --> 06:01.850
of the Holy Ghost. That should happen to all
of us and the time has come, the blossom time

06:03.470 --> 06:07.280
has come and thousands must get their realization.

06:07.280 --> 06:13.380
With this today I would explain to you the
different centers we have within ourselves

06:13.380 --> 06:19.270
and the chakras that are within us. I was
amazed, in New York they said that people

06:19.270 --> 06:24.590
are taking lot of money for this chakra therapy,
I mean I just can’t understand what they

06:24.590 --> 06:31.220
do about it, but all those who came from this
chakra therapies, had all their chakras ruined

06:31.220 --> 06:37.360
completely. I mean, you pay to ruin your chakras,
I just couldn’t understand. Anybody coming

06:37.360 --> 06:43.240
from India is not a saint, on the contrary,
as I told you, there could be greatest thuggery

06:43.240 --> 06:50.240
in India. Yes. They are very intelligent,
cunning people, they can be very good. If

06:50.400 --> 06:57.400
they are good, they are very, very good and
if they are bad, they are horrid.

06:57.940 --> 07:04.940
So you have to be careful when you think of
an Indian that, as we cannot say that all

07:06.500 --> 07:13.290
Americans are Mr. Ford, in the same way Indians
also, you must know how to discriminate. First

07:13.290 --> 07:19.150
of all your discrimination power must come,
otherwise you won’t be able to make out

07:19.150 --> 07:26.150
who is the real, who is not the real. That
must happen to you. Unless and until that

07:26.740 --> 07:33.740
happens the rest of it is, is of no use, because
as I said this room is dark and your eyes

07:34.590 --> 07:38.360
are closed, when you come inside you see nothing
but darkness and I start telling you, “this

07:38.360 --> 07:42.620
is this, this is this and I tell you there’s
one elephant you can’t see here and there’s

07:42.620 --> 07:49.250
one tiger sitting here,” you just believe
it. And there’s nothing like that here.

07:49.250 --> 07:55.340
And you people are definitely much more honest
that you can’t believe how people could

07:55.340 --> 07:59.960
be such fake. Oh, there can be fake people
all over the world.

07:59.960 --> 08:06.960
I am ashamed of it sometimes when I see that
in the great country of yoga, where such great

08:10.250 --> 08:17.250
incarnations came in, such great work of the
saints has been done, horrible people also

08:19.020 --> 08:26.020
are born in the same place because that’s
the place they want to harm, they want to

08:27.620 --> 08:34.400
attack. They are negative, not only negative
but they are very, very dangerous. I may tell

08:34.400 --> 08:39.110
about them tomorrow or day after, but today
I want to tell you about the good things that

08:39.110 --> 08:44.229
you are. The beauty that you are and how beautifully
you are made within yourself.

08:44.229 --> 08:51.229
So within us, as I told you, lies this residual
power called as Kundalini. This is the part

08:51.920 --> 08:58.920
of the all-pervading Power which thinks, which
understands, which coordinates, which loves.

08:59.350 --> 09:06.350
Is the integration of all these powers within
us, as this Kundalini. Now so many books have

09:09.449 --> 09:16.300
been written about Kundalini. When I read
them I was shocked that how could people write

09:16.300 --> 09:23.300
books about Kundalini without understanding
what it meant, without understanding where

09:24.880 --> 09:25.130
it was. Such big books have been written on
Kundalini, which says, “The Kundalini is

09:24.880 --> 09:30.690
in the stomach, some say this Kundalini’s
in the nose. I don’t know how could people

09:30.690 --> 09:31.600
write, I mean it takes nothing for them to
write something and to publish, and they are

09:31.600 --> 09:38.600
not afraid of God that they are writing all
these nonsensical things without understanding

09:43.740 --> 09:44.750
it.

09:44.750 --> 09:51.750
So this is the Kundalini that is placed in
the sacrum bone. Now this bone, even in English

09:52.380 --> 09:56.300
is called as sacrum, this word comes from
Greece as I told you that Greek people knew

09:56.300 --> 10:03.300
about Kundalini. Sacrum means sacred. This
bone is a sacred bone. And why is it a sacred

10:04.660 --> 10:11.470
bone because the Kundalini, the primordial
desire within us to be one with the Divine,

10:11.470 --> 10:12.970
is still unmanifested and sleeping, and is
the safest place where it has to be.

10:12.970 --> 10:19.970
Now you are paying attention to Me, now if
I say you pay attention to yourself, you cannot.

10:24.089 --> 10:28.530
You may say, “I’m paying attention,”
but you cannot, you cannot take your attention

10:28.530 --> 10:33.890
inside. But if there is some happening within
you, then your attention is drawn inside,

10:33.890 --> 10:40.890
so it is built like this that at a human level
this happening will take place of sprouting.

10:41.650 --> 10:48.579
And when this sprouting takes place, then
your attention is pulled inside. This attention

10:48.579 --> 10:54.059
has gone out because of the prismatic, as
you say the prism here, prismatic action of

10:54.059 --> 11:01.059
the brain of a human being. I will not go
into the details of it, but there is a big

11:02.670 --> 11:07.199
science about that: why our attention is outside
all the time.

11:07.199 --> 11:14.010
Now below the Kundalini, which is three-and-a-half
coils, is placed a very important center of

11:14.010 --> 11:21.010
innocence, is the center of innocence. The
first thing that was emitted out of the all-pervading

11:21.069 --> 11:27.760
Power was, it had the form, I should say the
all-pervading Power was nothing but just innocence,

11:27.760 --> 11:34.760
which is the most powerful thing in this world,
is your innocence. And this innocence is placed

11:36.610 --> 11:43.610
below the Kundalini, and is adorned by the
deity called as Shri Ganesha, who has a trunk

11:45.089 --> 11:52.089
like an elephant. This is the bija; this is
the seed of Christ. This forms the seed, and

11:52.990 --> 11:58.839
then He incarnated on this earth, this is
the subtle form, on this earth as Mahavishnu

11:58.839 --> 12:05.839
– is written down in the Devi Purana – or
we call Him as Christ. The name Christ and

12:07.809 --> 12:12.870
His name Jesus also has a very big meaning
and relates to something that happened before

12:12.870 --> 12:14.079
Him.

12:14.079 --> 12:21.079
Now this great incarnation of Christ came
on this earth, which was nothing but innocence,

12:22.030 --> 12:29.030
innocence itself took the form and it was
the all-pervading Power itself which took

12:30.079 --> 12:37.079
the form and came on this earth. That’s
why this is a very important center, is the

12:38.510 --> 12:45.510
beginning. Because it is innocence, is like
a lotus and it is placed at a point where

12:45.750 --> 12:52.750
the gate to hell are open within us. This
center gives rise in the gross … Now this

12:54.110 --> 13:01.110
is a subtle center called as Mooladhara Chakra.
Chakra Mooladhara. Mooladhara means the support

13:01.679 --> 13:07.920
of the root. Now root is the Kundalini. It
is the support of the root. Kundalini is the

13:07.920 --> 13:14.370
Mother, and this is your innocence, this is
your childhood and that’s the Mother. And

13:14.370 --> 13:21.370
the Mother is there to give you your realization,
waiting all the time, She is your own individual

13:24.520 --> 13:29.370
Mother, and She is just waiting, ages together,
to give you the experience of Self-realization,

13:29.370 --> 13:32.780
to give you your second birth.

13:32.780 --> 13:39.780
Now the last center looks after, in the gross,
the Pelvic Plexus, which you have heard of,

13:41.319 --> 13:48.319
which has also got four sub-plexuses, this
has also got four petals as we call it. There

13:50.640 --> 13:57.640
are four petals. So this center looks after
the pelvic plexus in the gross, which looks

13:57.860 --> 14:04.860
after the excretion. This center we must consider
at length, a little bit, which is very important

14:06.939 --> 14:13.420
to understand that this also looks after the
sex and reproduction, mainly the sex and other

14:13.420 --> 14:20.420
excretions. Now you can see here that it is
placed below the Kundalini. That means sex

14:23.370 --> 14:30.319
does not play any part in your evolution.
It does not. Those people who say that sex

14:30.319 --> 14:37.319
has something to do with Kundalini, are really
blasphemous and very ugly people because you

14:38.780 --> 14:45.780
cannot put sex to your Mother. It’s something,
even today is not accepted, when people have

14:46.230 --> 14:53.230
become so much lenient about sex, is not accepted.
And this is what it is when people talk of

14:53.569 --> 15:00.510
sex and Kundalini together. As a Mother, I
give them a little chance or sort of a little

15:00.510 --> 15:07.510
grace because to say that they originated
all this from deliberate action will be too

15:08.439 --> 15:13.500
much. I would say that maybe they when they
were meditating, at the sex point they might

15:13.500 --> 15:17.540
have seen Ganesha’s trunk which they might
have thought to be the Kundalini. Possibly

15:17.540 --> 15:23.709
that’s how they went into a wrong situation.
But of course it’s a very wrong thing.

15:23.709 --> 15:30.709
We have had cases in New York and here also
where the private parts of people were touched

15:32.089 --> 15:39.089
by some of the people, and are having a very
bad time with that action. It’s your private.

15:40.130 --> 15:47.130
It has nothing to do with sex. Animals are
more sex-conscious than you are; are they

15:48.870 --> 15:55.329
going to get evolution before you get? Moreover,
the whole thing that is worked out in such

15:55.329 --> 16:02.299
a way that we have started having the sex
through our mental activity, which is a wrong

16:02.299 --> 16:08.520
thing. Christ has said, “Thou shalt not
have adultery, thy should not commit adultery.

16:08.520 --> 16:15.520
But I say, I say verily to you, ‘Thou shalt
not have adulterous eyes.’ Because He knew

16:17.030 --> 16:24.030
this would happen one day that the sex would
move from there to the Swadisthana Chakra

16:24.520 --> 16:31.140
– the second chakra by which we think – and
then it will come into our thinking and our

16:31.140 --> 16:38.140
eyes will start roving around. And then, actually
the sex act minimizes, and it becomes a big

16:40.520 --> 16:45.480
problem; I mean to be a sex point itself becomes
an achievement for people then. It’s such

16:45.480 --> 16:52.480
an absurd thing to do. And this is what is
a very big confusion today in the modern times.

16:52.980 --> 16:59.459
I mean, you cannot make compromises with Christ;
what He said is absolute. But unless and until

16:59.459 --> 17:06.459
you understand that sex as a married life,
as a private thing, is the one that has been

17:09.169 --> 17:16.169
sanctioned for our sustenance, for our sustenance
as human beings; that has to be looked after,

17:19.380 --> 17:26.380
is to be respected, is sacred. And that’s
why anything else that we try to do, all kinds

17:27.380 --> 17:33.890
of perversions and these things – you won’t
believe that all kinds of perversions come

17:33.890 --> 17:38.830
to us because we are no more there. Mostly
we get possessed.

17:38.830 --> 17:45.830
We had one boy who came to us in New York
and he told me, “Mother, I… I’m a man,

17:47.790 --> 17:52.799
I have moustaches and everything but I want
to be like a woman. I want to be dressed up

17:52.799 --> 17:56.410
like a woman,” and he talked like a woman.
He said, “I want to walk like a woman, I

17:56.410 --> 18:01.730
don’t know what to do with myself. I am
so confused. And I cannot have any relationship

18:01.730 --> 18:06.110
with any woman because she gets confused with
me also. And I don’t know what is happening

18:06.110 --> 18:13.110
to me, why I want to be like this.” And
I could see he was possessed by a woman. He

18:13.620 --> 18:20.620
was just possessed by a woman, simple thing
as that. Very simple, it is extremely simple.

18:20.710 --> 18:27.710
And when that possession was removed, he said,
“I am a man again.” Is so simple, in one

18:28.560 --> 18:35.560
day. He is a different man altogether today,
absolutely a different personality, and it

18:36.200 --> 18:38.270
can happen to a woman.

18:38.270 --> 18:44.650
We had somebody from Australia and she got
possessed by a man and she started talking

18:44.650 --> 18:48.260
like that and behavior, the whole thing, her
husband got frightened, and he couldn’t

18:48.260 --> 18:53.780
understand what’s gone wrong with this lady.
And the whole attitude, the whole beauty of

18:53.780 --> 19:00.780
a woman was lost into the style of a man,
and it was so funny and odd to look at. Same

19:01.710 --> 19:08.640
thing: she came to Sahaj Yoga and the spirit
ran away. She is a beautiful woman now, extremely

19:08.640 --> 19:11.430
beautiful, and they’re having a very good
relationship.

19:11.430 --> 19:18.430
So when you try to do anything perverted with
the sex and do not respect it, you do not

19:19.180 --> 19:24.850
know what things are awaiting us around. So
before I go to other chakras, I want to tell

19:24.850 --> 19:31.420
you about our other unknown areas which are
very important to us and then we’ll go to

19:31.420 --> 19:32.960
the second chakra.

19:32.960 --> 19:39.960
As you see here on the left hand side this
blue line is there. This blue line is our

19:40.920 --> 19:47.920
power of desire by which we desire, by which
God has – supposing this is the primordial

19:50.290 --> 19:54.610
being because God has made you in His own
image – supposing it is the image of God,

19:54.610 --> 20:01.610
then it is His desire. This power of desire
gives you existence, and when this desire

20:01.700 --> 20:08.700
is over, when the Spirit, which is watching
the drama of this body, gets fed up, it disappears,

20:11.110 --> 20:18.110
then the death comes in. This power of desire
is the left side. We call it in Sanskrit as

20:20.050 --> 20:27.050
Ida Nadi, also called as the Moon Nadi and
in the Hatha Yoga is the Tha Nadi. This is

20:27.510 --> 20:33.940
the channel, is a subtle channel. But this
gives rise to the gross channel, which is

20:33.940 --> 20:37.950
the left sympathetic nervous system. Now,
doctors don’t believe that left and right

20:37.950 --> 20:42.380
sympathetic nervous systems are two different,
but you will find out yourself that they are

20:42.380 --> 20:49.380
very different. This looks after our emotional
side, and also beyond this lies the area which

20:51.840 --> 20:57.870
is unknown to us, is the subconscious; it
is unknown to us. Whatever is unknown is not

20:57.870 --> 21:04.840
God, is not from God’s area. It is an unknown
area, and beyond that subconscious area, lies

21:04.840 --> 21:11.840
the collective subconscious – all that has
died from our creation. Recently I was seeing

21:14.330 --> 21:21.330
one of the series on cancer, in London on
the television, and they told that they have

21:24.240 --> 21:31.240
discovered some sort of proteins, which they
call as protein 58 and 56 and all that, they

21:31.630 --> 21:38.630
have given names, which they have also photographed
– enter into our being from areas which

21:43.180 --> 21:48.630
are built within us, from unknown areas – they
do not know if they are known areas – which

21:48.630 --> 21:53.350
are built within us since our creation. Now,
I’ve told this about ten years back in America

21:53.350 --> 21:58.160
before. And they trigger the happening of
cancer, they trigger it.

21:58.160 --> 22:05.160
So it is from the collective subconscious
this attack comes in. So if you move to the

22:07.410 --> 22:13.870
left side, you move to the collective subconscious
too much and then all kinds of things can

22:13.870 --> 22:20.870
happen to you. For example, first of all you
start getting shaking, you start hearing voices,

22:21.380 --> 22:27.020
you start feeling that you are losing your
body; you are going on top of some place and

22:27.020 --> 22:33.870
seeing things. Is all these spirits are doing.
Now it has reached such a serious state, that

22:33.870 --> 22:40.870
in Switzerland I found that many children
were killed because of this action. The mother

22:42.910 --> 22:48.740
is, supposing, with some clairvoyant lady
or somebody who is doing this spiritual work.

22:48.740 --> 22:53.480
Is a very dangerous thing. One should never
take to this kind of a thing. If you take

22:53.480 --> 22:59.400
to these things, then seven generations suffer.
Today only I had a girl who told Me that her

22:59.400 --> 23:04.110
mother was a clairvoyant, and all her life
she was miserable with her husband and this

23:04.110 --> 23:09.180
girl has been always crying and weeping and
she cannot conceive or something like that.

23:09.180 --> 23:13.680
Is a very serious thing, one should never
go into these unknown areas of the collective

23:13.680 --> 23:19.790
subconscious and worry about the dead and
control them and look after them and call

23:19.790 --> 23:26.790
them. You must give them their freedom. Is
a very dangerous area into which you enter.

23:27.190 --> 23:31.200
I hope you don’t mind it, I have to tell
you the truth, I am your Mother, and I have

23:31.200 --> 23:35.870
to tell you the truth: that you should be
very careful about this kind of thing like

23:35.870 --> 23:41.840
psychics or the people who try to say that
“You can get possessed.” They will not

23:41.840 --> 23:45.730
say, they say, “It is, it is–” They
can even say, “This is Holy Ghost.” They

23:45.730 --> 23:52.460
can say anything. But in whatever way, when
you find that you are not in control of the

23:52.460 --> 23:58.810
situation, that means you are not there. Is
very simple as that, supposing your car is

23:58.810 --> 24:05.440
driving and suddenly it goes into a khadd
[pit – ED.]. Now, do you think that you

24:05.440 --> 24:11.440
have achieved a greater progress by that?
It’s just you have moved without your control.

24:11.440 --> 24:16.799
If you have no control upon yourself …If
somebody sitting down and he starts jumping

24:16.799 --> 24:23.799
– automatically, he cannot control his jumping
– then it is not himself, minimum of minimum.

24:23.990 --> 24:30.990
Whatever he is, even that control is lost.
Anything, any such happening which is beyond

24:31.960 --> 24:37.430
your control means that you are enslaved by
one of these possessions. But they are never

24:37.430 --> 24:39.660
satisfied with what they do to you.

24:39.660 --> 24:45.620
I mean like I’ll tell you one of the very
startling example of this left side. In London

24:45.620 --> 24:52.350
we have – I don’t know now if they have
but we had – a center called, “Late Dr.

24:52.350 --> 24:58.270
Laing’s International Curative Center.”
I didn’t know about it, but a lady came

24:58.270 --> 25:01.530
to Me in India to tell Me about this.

25:01.530 --> 25:08.170
She said she had some problem with her stomach
and she wrote to this organization saying

25:08.170 --> 25:12.310
that “Please, help me to get cured.”

25:12.310 --> 25:16.470
And they wrote back saying that “At five
o’clock on such-and-such date, we’ll enter

25:16.470 --> 25:22.000
into your body.” I mean they were honest,
I must say, as English people are honest sometimes.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.400
So he was honest to say that “We’ll enter
into your body, some of the doctors are there

25:26.400 --> 25:31.760
who will enter into your body, and they’ll
cure you.” But afterwards, after five years

25:31.760 --> 25:37.570
the lady was rattling, rattling just like
a junkie car. And she came to Me and then

25:37.570 --> 25:41.950
she gave Me the history of this, which I verified.

25:41.950 --> 25:47.270
The Dr. Laing, the Dr. Laing, the one, the
one who is the one who is supposed to be running,

25:47.270 --> 25:54.270
is late, he’s dead. He entered into a soldier
in Vietnam, an American, and told him that

25:57.330 --> 26:01.090
“You go and talk to my son and tell him
that I have entered into you and that you

26:01.090 --> 26:06.840
should start such and such organization.”
Now this soldier has never done anything,

26:06.840 --> 26:12.420
I mean he has never seen a scalpel also, he
doesn’t know how to operate, no question.

26:12.420 --> 26:18.460
This soldier went to the son and told him,
and he told him certain secrets which convinced

26:18.460 --> 26:25.460
the boy and they started that organization.
This organization went on like this. And this

26:28.260 --> 26:32.300
soldier, of all the persons, used to do the
operation, you see it’s called “psychic

26:32.300 --> 26:39.130
operation,” all sorts of things and he had
never seen anything and he used to be possessed

26:39.130 --> 26:46.130
by this man and he did it. But why didn’t
he go to his son directly? Because he knew

26:46.470 --> 26:53.470
about the dangers. And the same son will end
up – I am sure, hundred percent, the same

26:54.780 --> 27:00.070
gentleman who is operating and the son – with
some trouble, which is of a very serious nature.

27:00.070 --> 27:04.110
Because never play with the fire which is
the subconscious, the collective subconscious.

27:04.110 --> 27:07.470
You have to be in the present and not in the
past.

27:07.470 --> 27:12.490
Now the people who think too much about their
past, “What was my previous life?” Why

27:12.490 --> 27:18.190
should you worry? Whatever it was is better
today because you can get realization today.

27:18.190 --> 27:23.620
You could not get realization even if you
were the King of Egypt, what does it matter?

27:23.620 --> 27:29.360
You couldn’t get your realization that day,
so why worry about the past? All the time

27:29.360 --> 27:33.740
worrying about the past or playing with your
emotions, you see. Like we had one gentleman,

27:33.740 --> 27:40.320
who used to always cry and weep too much and
his mother sent him to Me, and I asked him,

27:40.320 --> 27:41.330
“What did you do all your life?”

27:41.330 --> 27:44.870
He said, “I was very fond of Lord Byron
and I just read him.”

27:44.870 --> 27:50.590
I said, “All right, that’s it.” This
Lord Byron, he led such a horrible life himself,

27:50.590 --> 27:53.190
an unholy person, and made everybody cry,

27:53.190 --> 27:55.530
“You suffer, you must suffer, you must weep.”
Why should you suffer?

27:55.530 --> 28:02.530
The idea of a saint is that a person who is
absolutely in bones, walking like a TB patient,

28:06.280 --> 28:11.250
is a saint. I mean is something sadistic,
I can’t see Christ. I was so happy to see

28:11.250 --> 28:17.270
that you showed Him as a resurrection, that
is His message. Is resurrection is His message.

28:17.270 --> 28:24.270
Crucifixion is just a means but resurrection
is the thing. And the lanky-panky stuff, walking

28:25.740 --> 28:32.450
like a saint, how can that be? Is it possible,
a person who is bestowed with God’s blessing

28:32.450 --> 28:38.860
has to be a healthy, cheerful and a very happy
person, has to be that. Minimum of minimum

28:38.860 --> 28:45.370
should be that, and I was happy to see even
Mr. Paulsen here, who was very healthy and

28:45.370 --> 28:51.200
this thing I said, “Now, this is a religious
place because wherever I go I find such serious

28:51.200 --> 28:51.820
and absolutely sickly people.”

28:51.820 --> 28:58.820
So the people who believe in sufferings, like…
the Jews they denied Christ. Why? Because

29:04.710 --> 29:10.309
He was a Jew. Is absolutely true about human
nature. If I was an American, you would not

29:10.309 --> 29:17.309
have accepted Me. In India the Indian Christians,
in whose community I was born, have not accepted

29:19.050 --> 29:25.670
Me at all. Can you imagine? I have got Muslim
disciples, Hindus, I’ve got Parsis and Sikhs,

29:25.670 --> 29:31.820
but hardly one or two and maybe My family
people. They have not accepted Me. They didn’t

29:31.820 --> 29:35.480
accept Christ, and because they didn’t accept
they couldn’t accept that He suffered for

29:35.480 --> 29:41.510
us. Why should we suffer? Has He suffered
less for you any way: has He left some for

29:41.510 --> 29:48.140
you to suffer? So, you want to suffer, all
right have Hitler and suffer? That’s it!

29:48.140 --> 29:55.140
Have him! If you enjoy suffering, why not?
And it started like that. Actually when Hitler

29:56.480 --> 30:01.550
came, for eleven years, you will be amazed,
eleven years, these people were supposed to

30:01.550 --> 30:03.770
be suffering you among themselves, you see?

30:03.770 --> 30:10.040
In France if you go today people are sitting
outside and they are talking of their sufferings

30:10.040 --> 30:16.410
and money and other nonsensical things. They
are waiting for the day, they said that that

30:16.410 --> 30:22.240
in ‘82 in any case we are going to be finished,
waiting for– they discussing it very nicely.

30:22.240 --> 30:28.290
Les Miserables I call them, as they are. So
why should you suffer, I just can’t understand,

30:28.290 --> 30:35.290
when Christ has suffered for you? Only He’s
to be awakened within us. If He’s awakened,

30:35.320 --> 30:41.480
He takes away all our sufferings, all our
conditionings, all our so-called karmas and

30:41.480 --> 30:46.090
everything, which I will show you later on
how it works out.

30:46.090 --> 30:50.880
So now we come to the left side then to the
right side. Right side is the action, the

30:50.880 --> 30:57.880
power of action, is the Surya Nadi, is the
channel of the sun. When you want to enact

31:00.770 --> 31:07.770
your desire, manifest it, then you use this
action power, Iccha Shakti is called in Sanskrit.

31:08.940 --> 31:14.470
Now this power works mainly through this second
center, or we call it the third center, actually

31:14.470 --> 31:20.750
it is the third because the second one is
that. This center is called as Swadisthana

31:20.750 --> 31:27.750
and this center has got six, you can see six
plexuses, it’s like the Star of David.

31:29.820 --> 31:36.820
Moses preached something, and Jews are doing
something else. Christ preached something,

31:40.480 --> 31:45.570
and Christians are doing something else. Adi
Shankaracharya taught something, and Hindus

31:45.570 --> 31:49.990
are doing just the opposite. Mohammed taught
something, and they did just the opposite.

31:49.990 --> 31:55.630
It’s not only in religion, in every way
you see how we are perverted. Like this center

31:55.630 --> 32:02.630
is used for converting the fat in your stomach
for the use of your brain. Nor do we realize

32:06.660 --> 32:12.920
that our brain is made of fat. Do we know
all our nerves are made of fat. Now there’s

32:12.920 --> 32:19.760
a general principle in this country that you
should not use any butter, which is very wrong.

32:19.760 --> 32:25.640
When you don’t use any butter how are you
going to supply this brain with something,

32:25.640 --> 32:29.200
I mean where will you get, it’s completely
drained out.

32:29.200 --> 32:36.200
You use your brain so much, so much so, that
this poor center has to work only for your

32:37.100 --> 32:42.270
thinking which has no productivity. You just
go on thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking;

32:42.270 --> 32:46.850
two horns come out of your head of thinking;
still you are thinking, and they go on growing,

32:46.850 --> 32:52.300
you cannot stop your thinking. And what are
you thinking, what have you got out of your

32:52.300 --> 32:53.070
thinking?

32:53.070 --> 33:00.070
This right side is the one which is our five
elements also, five elements within us. So

33:02.750 --> 33:09.750
when we started discovering what is the essence
of the five elements, in India we started

33:11.679 --> 33:17.010
the Vedas thousands of years back, and the
effect of that is shown now, is the science,

33:17.010 --> 33:23.380
you discovered, the science. That you understood
how to master these five elements. But what

33:23.380 --> 33:28.580
did you do with it? You created bombs; horrible
bombs you have created. You have created these

33:28.580 --> 33:35.000
devils and now you are frightened of them.
Thank God. That’s something good that all

33:35.000 --> 33:40.429
such ventures stop by themselves because you
create a bomb, it becomes a devil on top of

33:40.429 --> 33:45.900
your head. Now you can’t start war because
as soon as you start means no more existence.

33:45.900 --> 33:50.090
So you are frightened and that is how – where
have we gone to?

33:50.090 --> 33:56.429
Science has led us to which sensible things,
we should think. For example science has given

33:56.429 --> 34:03.320
us all these devices by which our life can
be made very easy. We can have more time,

34:03.320 --> 34:10.230
we can have much more time than our forefathers
had, who had to do everything with their own

34:10.230 --> 34:14.809
hands and go about it, but here, you see,
everything is instant. I mean anything: You

34:14.809 --> 34:19.780
want to have food? All right you have instant,
everything is made instant. But for what is

34:19.780 --> 34:25.770
it instant, is to save time. Now we have watches
also here to save time, everybody’s saving

34:25.770 --> 34:31.270
time, saving time, everybody “busy” saving
time. But what are you doing about the saved

34:31.270 --> 34:36.399
time? What do we do with it? For example there
was a gentleman coming from India, very busy

34:36.399 --> 34:40.059
man, “Very busy, there’s no time to talk
to anyone.”

34:40.059 --> 34:46.159
And I said, “Wanna, why are you in such
a great hurry to go?”

34:46.159 --> 34:48.819
“Oh, you don’t know! I have very important
–“

34:48.819 --> 34:49.069
“What?”

34:48.819 --> 34:51.639
“I have to attend a particular ball for
five hours there.”

34:51.639 --> 34:54.359
“Very good. Is that the way you are going
to save?”

34:54.359 --> 34:59.950
“And then I have to attend a racecourse,
I have to do this, I have to do that.” This

34:59.950 --> 35:05.760
is no saving of time; this is the real waste
of time. Real waste of time is this way we

35:05.760 --> 35:12.760
do it, and how are we going to save our time?
Time is to be saved to be realized, to be

35:12.829 --> 35:18.759
in meditation, to enjoy the beauties of God.
That’s why these all things are given to

35:18.759 --> 35:23.450
us, and that’s how we should look at them.
But now we have become their slaves.

35:23.450 --> 35:30.450
When we achieve something, for example electricity,
it is so important to New York that one day

35:30.519 --> 35:36.460
it stopped, the whole thing stopped. So we
become also slaves to these. Apart from that,

35:36.460 --> 35:42.759
now we have no time, we are so busy. I don’t
know. I thought that here people will have

35:42.759 --> 35:46.989
more time than we have in India because, you
see, if you have to travel we have very funny

35:46.989 --> 35:52.279
trains, and we have not yet developed as you
people are. Sometimes I have to go to villages

35:52.279 --> 35:57.579
in bullock carts and this and this. But people
have no time. This is the trouble in these

35:57.579 --> 36:03.059
countries, you have no time at all and I don’t
know what constructive work they are doing

36:03.059 --> 36:03.720
for themselves.

36:03.720 --> 36:10.109
So this is what is the right side where we
go wrong. But the worst thing we do is to

36:10.109 --> 36:17.109
think. We think all the time, and what do
we think? Either we think of aggression or

36:19.670 --> 36:26.670
we think of recession. For example we think
that, “Oh, we are guilty.” You do something

36:27.559 --> 36:31.450
and then you sit down, “Oh, I should not
have done it, this is very wrong I should

36:31.450 --> 36:38.019
not have done it,” and you start wondering
about it, correcting about it. But actual

36:38.019 --> 36:44.079
correction is not there, actual correction
is not there, only by thinking you avoid the

36:44.079 --> 36:49.749
main issue. You have to be in the present
but thinking can only take you to the left

36:49.749 --> 36:55.119
or to the right, to the past or to the present.
[future – ED?] You cannot be at the state

36:55.119 --> 37:00.749
where you become just yourself, there’s
no thought. There is no mental activity at

37:00.749 --> 37:07.450
all, you just become. Because a thought rises
like this and falls off, another thought rises

37:07.450 --> 37:12.579
like that and falls off, in between them is
a very little space which is the present.

37:12.579 --> 37:18.440
So the past comes to the future and becomes,
again the future comes in and again becomes

37:18.440 --> 37:24.999
the past like that. But in between is the
present and that present is very small.

37:24.999 --> 37:30.980
Unless and until you know how to stay in that
present, you will be always tossing on these

37:30.980 --> 37:37.980
waves of past and future while past is finished
and future doesn’t exist. You plan out something,

37:38.150 --> 37:44.309
it – all plans goes out. You plan anything
but how can you plan also, I can’t understand.

37:44.309 --> 37:49.579
Supposing you don’t know the way, and you
plan that, “I will go right and left.”

37:49.579 --> 37:52.069
Now supposing you are going to the right and
left is the sea, will you jump in the sea?

37:52.069 --> 37:59.069
Anything that you have to do new, you cannot
plan it out, you have to keep it just open,

38:00.619 --> 38:07.619
like a seed when it sprouts, it has got a
living cell at its tip. It goes and sees for

38:07.970 --> 38:14.049
itself how it has to move. When there is hardness,
it moves round the hardness, when there is

38:14.049 --> 38:15.339
softness, it moves like that.

38:15.339 --> 38:21.559
So when we plan everything we really become
rigid, and like – I heard of a person who

38:21.559 --> 38:26.420
planned everything for his picnic. He had
all champagne and everything put together

38:26.420 --> 38:31.910
and when he reached the place he had no bottle
opener and he had to break the bottles. That’s

38:31.910 --> 38:37.339
what it is. Sometimes the planning can be
such a headache, I mean, you waste one hour

38:37.339 --> 38:42.579
in planning and while it comes to reality
you find it’s all wrong, it doesn’t work

38:42.579 --> 38:48.109
out. So too much planning, like I have to
go supposing to Los Angeles, I have to book

38:48.109 --> 38:51.989
My ticket, this is today, I have to do it
today. I don’t have to sit down and plan

38:51.989 --> 38:54.450
that on such and such date I’ll go and book
it.

38:54.450 --> 38:58.549
So in the present if you know how to live,
but this cannot be done by saying that “You

38:58.549 --> 39:02.970
live in present.” It cannot be done, I know
because that’s not some sort of a thing

39:02.970 --> 39:08.069
that can be taught. It has to happen to you,
you have to become that. Once you become that,

39:08.069 --> 39:15.069
then you become thoughtlessly aware. You become
a witness. You see the whole show as a drama,

39:15.970 --> 39:20.589
and you don’t get involved into it. You
just see the waves coming up and going down.

39:20.589 --> 39:26.900
Like, I can say, you are standing in the water,
and there are waves around and you are frightened,

39:26.900 --> 39:33.739
but if you are put in the boat you start seeing
those things. If you know how to swim you

39:33.739 --> 39:33.989
can enjoy those waves.

39:33.819 --> 39:39.880
In the same way when you become a master,
when you come in the boat in the state of

39:39.880 --> 39:43.390
thoughtless awareness then you start seeing
these things and the whole thing appears like

39:43.390 --> 39:48.779
a drama. Actually the whole thing is a drama
but the drama must end for you to see that

39:48.779 --> 39:54.559
it’s just a drama and you are unnecessarily
worried about it, and by worry, you know for

39:54.559 --> 39:58.589
definite nothing works out. But if I say,
“Don’t worry,” you’ll worry more,

39:58.589 --> 40:04.079
that’s not the way. That’s not the way.
They all tried these tricks to say, “Don’t

40:04.079 --> 40:07.369
do that and don’t do that,” it never worked.
With human beings it doesn’t work out. It’s

40:07.369 --> 40:11.670
all right with animals, you can work it out,
but with human beings, if you tell them, “Don’t,”

40:11.670 --> 40:18.140
they’ll do it ten time. So best is to so
make them that. Unless and until they are

40:18.140 --> 40:23.710
made the spirit it’s impossible to convince
a modern man to do something. So is best is

40:23.710 --> 40:28.940
first let them have their realization, let
them have their light, let them see for themselves

40:28.940 --> 40:33.450
what’s the problem, let them feel it and
correct it. It’s let them judge themselves,

40:33.450 --> 40:40.210
that is the best way is to do it, and that’s
the time has come for you to have it and see

40:40.210 --> 40:47.210
for yourself and be able to discriminate between
false and reality.

40:47.269 --> 40:54.269
Now this side beyond is the supraconscious
area, and beyond this is the collective supraconscious.

40:56.489 --> 41:03.489
Now if you take LSD, for example you take
LSD, you go onto supraconscious area. I was

41:06.400 --> 41:13.400
surprised when I went to Colombia, I asked
them, they had a condor as their emblem for

41:13.619 --> 41:19.559
navy, and I said, “How condor is your emblem?”
because condor has nothing to do with the

41:19.559 --> 41:19.989
navy.

41:19.989 --> 41:26.989
They said, “Our old Indians have told us
that a God called Shri Vishnu,” just see

41:27.049 --> 41:33.160
the name, “came on a condor.” And really
condor is the conveyance of Vishnu. Can you

41:33.160 --> 41:38.910
imagine? I was amazed at this. How did these
people in thousands of years backs saw, but

41:38.910 --> 41:43.220
then I said, “What were they doing normally,
what was their pastime?” And they showed

41:43.220 --> 41:50.220
Me a thing made out of a shell of a fruit
and with a little stirring rod in it.

41:53.789 --> 41:54.799
I said, “What is this?”

41:54.799 --> 41:56.559
They said, “They used to make some sort
of a amrose.”

41:56.559 --> 41:58.329
“Oh, I see, that’s it.”

41:58.329 --> 42:03.869
And even today Peru is exporting that amrose
to you which is nothing but LSD.

42:03.869 --> 42:09.759
If you take things like that, of that nature,
of LSD nature, you go to the right side. You

42:09.759 --> 42:14.400
move to your supraconscious area. Means you
get disintegrated.

42:14.400 --> 42:19.099
In the morning I told you that when you are
integrated you don’t see any auras or anything

42:19.099 --> 42:23.299
around the person. When you are disintegrated,
only then you see because you become these

42:23.299 --> 42:29.170
five elements. When you are integrated you
don’t see anything. And then you start seeing

42:29.170 --> 42:34.229
these things, like an eye and a light, and
all those things you start seeing, and if

42:34.229 --> 42:41.229
you go further, further with it into supraconscious
areas, you can become horribly possessed by

42:42.519 --> 42:49.519
the people who have been ambitious. Even Hitler
can possess you. Hitler did that. Hitler did

42:50.259 --> 42:56.200
all supraconscious activity in Germany. How
he possessed people was through supraconscious.

42:56.200 --> 43:01.200
Because in the supraconscious, collective
supraconscious, there are many ambitious people

43:01.200 --> 43:07.400
who have died. Like Gauguin was an ambitious
man, but he became mad, I don’t know how

43:07.400 --> 43:12.729
he became mad. Normally an ambitious man doesn’t
become mad he makes everyone mad, but he doesn’t

43:12.729 --> 43:17.509
become himself. But this fellow was possessed,
and we saw it in the television that a man

43:17.509 --> 43:22.410
who was possessed by this Gauguin was painting
just like him. I know – you see Gauguin’s

43:22.410 --> 43:27.150
paintings, that you must be knowing also that
in one line he puts lots of color and he was

43:27.150 --> 43:30.779
doing it very fast. And he said, “I’m
possessed by Gauguin.”

43:30.779 --> 43:35.630
So these ambitious people, like some of the
ambitious people could be doctors, could be

43:35.630 --> 43:42.630
mathematicians, can be physicians or anything
like that, they can possess.

43:43.779 --> 43:50.729
I know of a lady, she is a unique mathematician
and she’s possessed, definitely possessed.

43:50.729 --> 43:53.739
And she can tell you anything you ask her,
any square root, anything she can tell you,

43:53.739 --> 43:58.170
and she’s earning lot of money out of it
but she’s always sick, she has a headache.

43:58.170 --> 44:01.410
She came to Me for curing, I said, “You
have to give up this nonsense.”

44:01.410 --> 44:03.979
She said, “Let me make sufficient money,
then I’ll give up.”

44:03.979 --> 44:10.089
I said, “By that time I may not be there.”

44:10.089 --> 44:14.190
So these things can happen to you with the
supraconscious activity and this awareness

44:14.190 --> 44:19.880
of supraconscious is also very dangerous.
The trouble is if you suffer from the superego

44:19.880 --> 44:26.739
there, from this side, with the conditionings,
you suffer. I mean you get the pains all over

44:26.739 --> 44:32.819
the body, you might feel sick, you will cry
and weep, you’ll be unhappy, it troubles

44:32.819 --> 44:38.470
you. But when you are possessed by this ego
business, as it is ego is too much, and then

44:38.470 --> 44:44.700
if you get possessed by somebody egoistical,
then God save that person and God save all

44:44.700 --> 44:49.609
the relations, because such a person you cannot
even talk, he’s so aggressive, he’s so

44:49.609 --> 44:56.609
aggressive, he will aggress all the other
people ultimately he himself becomes absolutely

44:57.950 --> 45:00.239
stupid fool.

45:00.239 --> 45:04.559
Many people whom we think are very successful
in life, really are stupid; if you look at

45:04.559 --> 45:10.410
them they are really stupid people. Like we
can say, this Kennedy’s… a man, what was

45:10.410 --> 45:13.150
his name is, whom she married –

45:13.150 --> 45:14.059
Man: Onasis

45:14.059 --> 45:21.059
Shri Mataji: He was a stupid fool, I have
met him. I met him; he was a real fool I tell

45:21.630 --> 45:25.380
you. I don’t know how this woman married
him and she must be another stupid fool to

45:25.380 --> 45:30.319
marry him. Both must be foolish. Actually
I met him very well, because My husband is

45:30.319 --> 45:34.519
with the shipping, and I don’t know how
could she marry this old man like her grandfather

45:34.519 --> 45:38.989
and what was the thing? Maybe money part or
whatever it was, I mean it’s so stupid,

45:38.989 --> 45:45.369
the whole thing is so stupid. And this stupidity
you can see, even it grows with your age more

45:45.369 --> 45:47.880
and more, and you become more stupid.

45:47.880 --> 45:52.079
Like an eighty-year-old woman writing love
letters to an eighteen-year-old boy. It’s

45:52.079 --> 45:58.009
stupidity. Is absolute stupidity, I tell you,
if you see it from wisdom point of view. One

45:58.009 --> 46:02.650
can’t understand an old man, who is like
a great-grandfather, writing a love letter

46:02.650 --> 46:07.930
to a little girl of eighteen years or an old
woman, who could be a great-great-great-grandmother

46:07.930 --> 46:11.210
writing to a little boy like that, it’s
absurd. And they are so stupid and they talk

46:11.210 --> 46:17.729
like this, “I believe in this.” Of course
all the donkeys believe like that, so there’s

46:17.729 --> 46:19.200
nothing new about it.

46:19.200 --> 46:25.190
But they are so starringly stupid that you
are amazed, you know. You start looking at

46:25.190 --> 46:31.910
them, “What’s the matter with them?”
This is the blessing of this mister ego, which

46:31.910 --> 46:37.930
exists in the head sometimes goes up like
a balloon, but you start seeing it, you start

46:37.930 --> 46:41.799
seeing it when you get your realization.

46:41.799 --> 46:48.799
I had a disciple, one of My sons, who came
to Me and one day he said, “Mother, I’m

46:51.049 --> 46:51.970
really frightened with one idea.”

46:51.970 --> 46:53.259
I Said, “What is it?”

46:53.259 --> 46:55.559
“But You don’t tell me if it is true.”

46:55.559 --> 46:56.829
I said, “What is it?”

46:56.829 --> 46:59.130
He said, “Was I Napoleon in my last life?”

46:59.130 --> 47:01.170
I said, “What makes you think like that?”

47:01.170 --> 47:05.609
“Because I can see such a big ego on my
head, this could be only Napoleon and I know

47:05.609 --> 47:10.279
how to draw. These two things put together,
could I have been Napoleon, but if I was You

47:10.279 --> 47:14.630
don’t tell me otherwise I may commit suicide”
– even after realization.

47:14.630 --> 47:21.630
So it is ego becomes then a headache to us.
It becomes a headache and we want to get rid

47:21.950 --> 47:27.559
of it. We start seeing it, and it presses
you, you get a headache and you feel it in

47:27.559 --> 47:34.009
the Agnya, how it troubles you. Then it starts
troubling you – not others so much as it

47:34.009 --> 47:36.999
troubles you – because you don’t want
to accept that you are egoistical, you start

47:36.999 --> 47:41.319
seeing it. But you don’t say that you have
a ego, you will come and tell Me, “Mother

47:41.319 --> 47:45.119
I’ve got an Agnya catching,” and we have
to clear that Agnya. Nobody feels bad about

47:45.119 --> 47:50.809
it because you are separated from yourself.
You don’t feel that you are hurt or insulted

47:50.809 --> 47:55.380
because you get separated, and you see for
yourself. Like this sari has some sort of

47:55.380 --> 47:59.910
a black spot on it, so I see it, I take it
out, and then I want to wash it, I don’t

47:59.910 --> 48:02.239
want to keep it black; I am not identified
with it.

48:02.239 --> 48:07.640
So all these fixations also drop out when
you get realized, because you go in the center,

48:07.640 --> 48:09.410
not on the left or to the right.

48:09.410 --> 48:16.410
Now movement on the right, actually is the
blessing of this center, in the center, because

48:19.940 --> 48:26.940
the central line is this line of our evolution,
is the line of sustenance, is the line by

48:27.319 --> 48:29.690
which we have become human beings.

48:29.690 --> 48:36.690
First of all we get our sustenance, like we
can say the gold is untarnishable. That is

48:37.829 --> 48:44.279
the sustenance of gold. We can say carbon
has four valences, in the same way human beings

48:44.279 --> 48:50.910
have ten valences – they are in the stomach.
These are the ten sustenance described as

48:50.910 --> 48:57.910
the Ten Commandments in the Bible. They all
can be explained very well in Sahaj Yoga.

48:58.029 --> 49:05.029
This is the human sustenance which is around
in that part which we call as Void. It’s

49:06.099 --> 49:13.099
not the same Void, or is the gap, as the Zen,
but this is the Void, we mean the space where

49:14.619 --> 49:21.619
we exist in our evolutionary state. Now this
center is the one that is presided over – this

49:24.170 --> 49:30.920
one, the second one is presided over by the
Creator, and this one is through the Preserver,

49:30.920 --> 49:31.609
the one who preserves.

49:31.609 --> 49:37.859
Now there can be a problem with people who
believe that there is one God. I also believe

49:37.859 --> 49:42.779
the same thing. I mean, it is true: He – there’s
only one God, but He has different aspects.

49:42.779 --> 49:49.430
God doesn’t exist like, say, Rock of Gibraltar.
Even Rock of Gibraltar, if you see, it has

49:49.430 --> 49:56.430
got aspects. God has aspects like a gentleman,
now say for example if a gentleman is a minister

49:56.499 --> 50:01.950
here, he could be a husband, he could be a
father, he could be a brother, he could be

50:01.950 --> 50:07.499
anything. So God has different aspects and
out of that the first aspect, as I told you

50:07.499 --> 50:13.809
of the existence, the power of existence,
that does not incarnate on this earth, it

50:13.809 --> 50:19.450
does not incarnate, it just exist, it watches,
it sees, and that is in the heart, which is

50:19.450 --> 50:26.450
the Spirit – expression of that God Almighty
who is watching the spectacle of His Power.

50:29.349 --> 50:35.200
Now the other aspect of God is that He’s
a Creator, He creates all these galaxies and

50:35.200 --> 50:42.200
all these things now as I told you yesterday
about the Vishuddhi Chakra, we are this center

50:43.660 --> 50:50.660
which is America, that if this center is awakened
here, you don’t have to have any missiles

50:51.999 --> 50:58.809
or anything. As in the Saturn, you have got
a girdle around, you too have that girdle

50:58.809 --> 51:04.739
around America and nobody can touch you, but
you are to be awakened first of all. If you

51:04.739 --> 51:11.739
are awakened in that center, nobody can touch
you. Russia is going to know about it, they

51:14.690 --> 51:18.279
have to know about it because they are getting
into parapsychology and all these things and

51:18.279 --> 51:22.809
they are going to get possessed about this.
They have to know through their supraconscious

51:22.809 --> 51:25.279
that you are the people who are awakened.

51:25.279 --> 51:30.609
Once you are awakened nobody can touch you,
because there’s a girdle round you, and

51:30.609 --> 51:36.279
there are sixteen sub-plexuses as there are
sixteen, you have seen there are sixteen substar

51:36.279 --> 51:38.009
– sub, what do you call them?

51:38.009 --> 51:38.690
Warren: Moons

51:38.690 --> 51:45.690
Shri Mataji: Moons, they call them moons,
sixteen moons around Saturn. And you are one

51:46.950 --> 51:52.839
guided by Saturn. Saturn makes this country.
Saturn has made this country, and this is

51:52.839 --> 51:57.529
the Vishuddhi Chakra which is a very important
chakra about which I’ll tell later.

51:57.529 --> 52:04.529
So this center we come to of our evolution.
Is presided by the Preserver, the aspect of

52:05.019 --> 52:12.019
preservation, He’s the Father who looks
after us; He’s the One who gives us our

52:12.799 --> 52:17.880
wellbeing. He comes on this earth again and
again in different forms. According to Indian

52:17.880 --> 52:24.880
Puranas, the Ark of Noah was saved by a fish,
which was a dolphin, and this dolphin fish

52:27.390 --> 52:34.390
was this aspect which incarnated. Then the
second aspect came as the tortoise, then the

52:36.099 --> 52:42.839
third as a quadiped. Like that they have described
the evolution, how these incarnations had

52:42.839 --> 52:49.839
to come to break the barriers of the evolutionary
ignorance. These are the people who came for

52:52.059 --> 52:59.059
the break-through. Ultimately a short man
was created called as Vamana, then a very

52:59.710 --> 53:04.440
fiery, big man, he’s called as Passidon,
[Poseidon – ED] in Greek language.

53:04.440 --> 53:10.979
Greeks made their gods look like human beings;
I mean they never kept their purity. See,

53:10.979 --> 53:15.609
everybody was given with some quality of a
human being. I don’t know why they did it

53:15.609 --> 53:22.039
but that’s how they spoiled the whole game.
Now this god, the god, which we can say or

53:22.039 --> 53:29.039
the incarnation that came on this earth was
a fiery man, a man who fought the nature,

53:31.089 --> 53:38.089
who fought all the different elements. And
then after that came another aspect on this

53:40.890 --> 53:47.890
earth, who was Shri Rama, is the ideal king,
the king who is a benevolent king, the One

53:50.529 --> 53:57.150
who gave us the political idea about how to
govern – Shri Rama – this was eight thousand

53:57.150 --> 53:57.960
years back.

53:57.960 --> 54:04.960
Then came the incarnation, after that the
incarnation came in the center here, before,

54:05.190 --> 54:11.579
before Rama, this incarnation was of the Goddess,
of the primordial Mother. She Herself incarnated

54:11.579 --> 54:18.579
on this earth before Rama, because many forces
which were negative were collected by the

54:18.650 --> 54:25.019
ignorance of human beings, and the seekers
were very much harmed. So She came on this

54:25.019 --> 54:32.019
earth to kill those horrible, demonic forces
and to destroy them and to save the seekers,

54:33.150 --> 54:39.589
Her children, to save them from this drowning
into the sea of illusion, and She came on

54:39.589 --> 54:45.160
this earth. As they say she came thousand
times, but actually She came many-a-times

54:45.160 --> 54:47.119
before Shri Rama came in.

54:47.119 --> 54:53.359
Then came Shri Rama who came on the right-hand
side of the heart. Now this is also a very

54:53.359 --> 54:59.170
important center within us. Those people who
have problems with the fatherhood. Like today

54:59.170 --> 55:04.950
there was a girl who was catching on the right
hand, this heart, this is the center. We asked

55:04.950 --> 55:11.089
her what about her father, and she told Me,
“My father is dead but he’s still guiding

55:11.089 --> 55:11.729
me.”

55:11.729 --> 55:16.499
I said, “That’s not good, you must give
relief to your father. He should be given

55:16.499 --> 55:18.749
freedom, and you will feel better.”

55:18.749 --> 55:25.210
And people with this heart get asthma. This
side, this problem, on this finger we feel,

55:25.210 --> 55:29.999
get asthma, problems with their breathing…
All these things can be cured if you just

55:29.999 --> 55:36.759
tell them that, “You ask your father to
leave you and to be born again and forget

55:36.759 --> 55:43.759
about it.” It works wonders, we have seen.
But recently a doctor in England has performed

55:44.289 --> 55:51.289
some experiments with, what you call, anorexia
– there’s a disease anorexia, where the

55:53.329 --> 55:58.109
girls just don’t eat any food. He found
out that these girls, when they were told

55:58.109 --> 56:03.650
about their father, and that a rite can be,
I mean the after death rites can be done and

56:03.650 --> 56:07.489
all that, they felt all right and they got
rid of it.

56:07.489 --> 56:11.900
Can you imagine this is experimented and found
out now; I mean this we have been doing for

56:11.900 --> 56:16.339
the last ten years, but recently it has been
found out that if a girl is suffering from

56:16.339 --> 56:22.479
this disease of anorexia, you can cure it;
if the father is dead, then only it happens.

56:22.479 --> 56:29.479
So fatherhood –a man who is not a good father,
a man who has a bad father, a girl who is

56:30.359 --> 56:37.359
too much attached to the father or a girl
who is not treated nicely also by her husband

56:38.270 --> 56:42.650
– also the husband is there – if he doesn’t
look after her well, she can suffer.

56:42.650 --> 56:47.119
Now the center part, this one – the one
he’s there [Warren is showing on the Virata

56:47.119 --> 56:51.680
Chakra chart] – center heart, it’s also
a very, very important center where the Goddess

56:51.680 --> 56:58.680
– the world, we say the Mother of the World,
Jagadamba She’s called – has incarnated.

56:59.440 --> 57:06.440
Is a very important thing for us, because
when you suffer, say, from any insecurities,

57:07.089 --> 57:14.089
then this center starts going into palpitations,
this center starts vibrating very much. Till

57:15.519 --> 57:21.650
the boy is of twelve years or a girl is of
twelve years, in the sternum bone the antibodies

57:21.650 --> 57:28.650
are created by this center. This center creates
the antibodies and they circulate in the whole

57:28.660 --> 57:34.839
body and remain there, and whenever there
is an attack, either from a entity or from

57:34.839 --> 57:39.999
any disease or anything, these antibodies
fight it. And that is the center which is

57:39.999 --> 57:45.459
very important, specially for women. If their
motherhood is challenged or if they are insecure,

57:45.459 --> 57:51.180
if their husbands are making them insecure
by any of their behavior, then they develop

57:51.180 --> 57:58.180
this trouble of this center, where they may
get breast cancer. Breast cancer comes to

57:58.589 --> 58:05.589
women when they are insecure. Only it can
be cured when this center is awakened; breast

58:06.190 --> 58:12.660
cancer can be very easily cured, if they could
be secured through awakening of this center

58:12.660 --> 58:15.670
of the Mother of the Universe.

58:15.670 --> 58:21.640
And then we have the center up there, which
is the Vishuddhi Chakra, which is a very important…

58:21.640 --> 58:28.640
for you, because it is adorned by the completion
of this evolution as called as Virat – it

58:34.269 --> 58:41.269
is Shri Krishna, who is the complete incarnation
of this primordial being. And He is placed

58:43.279 --> 58:50.279
there. It is He who is the witness, who is
watching. When the Kundalini rises over this,

58:56.019 --> 58:58.400
you start witnessing the whole thing.

58:58.400 --> 59:04.749
It has got sixteen sub plexuses and which
look after your face, your nose, eyes, ears

59:04.749 --> 59:11.749
and all these places. And when this center
is out, then you have all kinds of problems.

59:13.130 --> 59:20.130
Say the left side, left side Vishuddhi Chakra
catches when you feel guilty, when you are

59:20.299 --> 59:24.549
diffident. When you start thinking that, “It
is very wrong too, I should have not done

59:24.549 --> 59:29.559
this,” and all that, then the left Vishuddhi
catches. Or also with smoking it catches;

59:29.559 --> 59:36.559
smoking spoils this center very much. Imagine
in America the percentage of smokers is the

59:37.049 --> 59:43.369
maximum. Can you imagine, in this center only
where they are born, this is the maximum here?

59:43.369 --> 59:50.369
Like England is the heart of the universe,
where they are lethargic. Europe is the liver

59:50.549 --> 59:57.549
of the world where they are drinking. America
is the Vishuddhi of the world where they are

59:58.400 --> 01:00:02.739
smoking. What a justice done to themselves
and to God, their Creator! So smoking is against

01:00:02.739 --> 01:00:08.660
this center. Thank God now it is established
that it causes cancer, but still people are

01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:12.499
smoking, they say, “What does it matter?”

01:00:12.499 --> 01:00:17.059
But this is a very, very important center
for us because this is the time when we raised

01:00:17.059 --> 01:00:21.559
our head, this center came up. Now see the
ego and superego start developing actually

01:00:21.559 --> 01:00:28.559
from here. So this gives rise to ego and superego.
Somebody is a very arrogant person, catches

01:00:29.989 --> 01:00:35.469
on the right; who is a very aggressive type
he catches on the right Vishuddhi. In the

01:00:35.469 --> 01:00:42.469
center, a person who is against God, who is
anti-God, who is against collectivity, who

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:54.880
is talking against God, who is openly saying
things against God, catches on this center.

01:00:55.950 --> 01:01:02.529
So this center, as it is, is very important
for you, because if you can awaken this center

01:01:02.529 --> 01:01:07.349
within you here, as I’ve told you, you become
as powerful as Shri Krishna.

01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:14.349
Shri Krishna has a Samhara Shakti. He has
the power to kill; He has four special things

01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:21.680
with Him, four weapons by which He kills,
but one of them is this, in His hand, is a

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:28.680
discus and this discus is shown around the
Saturn which you see. And with this discus

01:01:29.359 --> 01:01:36.359
at any distance He can destroy. So His destructive
powers are built in you. Nobody can destroy

01:01:38.989 --> 01:01:45.739
you. You have to just get to your Self and
become your Self. You’ll become so powerful

01:01:45.739 --> 01:01:52.739
a nation – but powerful in loving, in being
compassionate and affectionate, in the real

01:01:54.029 --> 01:01:59.959
sense of the word, not the way we are now
trying to help others; is not the way. It

01:01:59.959 --> 01:02:04.660
can be very disgraceful sometimes; the way
we try to help others can be very disgraceful.

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:10.279
You will be amazed how, sometimes you people
have helped and have created problem for others.

01:02:10.279 --> 01:02:17.279
I’ll give a very simple example which is
really surprising and astonishing. Some years

01:02:18.349 --> 01:02:23.150
back we had a dearth of wheat, and people
sent horrible wheat to India, horrible, that

01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:29.029
even the animals would not eat. Just to help
us, you see. We are not so badly off people;

01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:34.719
we are very fussy about food. We may be poor
but we don’t eat everything; we are very

01:02:34.719 --> 01:02:41.719
fussy. So people threw away that wheat outside.
That wheat grew into a grass, which was called

01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:48.900
as “Congress Grass,” can you imagine,
and that grass started moving from the roads

01:02:49.019 --> 01:02:56.019
to the fields, from the fields to all the
trees and started engulfing them. It was like

01:02:56.119 --> 01:03:03.119
a mad grass, it was like a malignant grass,
eating away everything that there was. Imagine,

01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:09.890
as it is we had dearth of thing and this thing
came, and we didn’t know what to do with

01:03:09.890 --> 01:03:10.469
it.

01:03:10.469 --> 01:03:15.849
So we tried some Sahaj Yoga tricks and it
has worked, and thank God that grass is now

01:03:15.849 --> 01:03:22.469
finished. But from that grass you had sent
some other seeds of acacia, and these also

01:03:22.469 --> 01:03:28.329
people threw away. Out of this came out such
horrible trees of acacia that it has got thorns

01:03:28.329 --> 01:03:32.670
which are poisonous. And in the villages they
have grown so big that children can’t play

01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:38.650
and if they touch that they get very seriously
ill. It’s a very seri– which you have

01:03:38.650 --> 01:03:45.479
done so innocently. There’s no grace about
it, I think, the way it was done, and that’s

01:03:45.479 --> 01:03:49.779
how we can create problem through our help
to others because what is there to help. Who

01:03:49.779 --> 01:03:53.779
is the other?

01:03:53.779 --> 01:03:58.539
If you are the collectivity, if you are Shri
Krishna, then what are you helping? You are

01:03:58.539 --> 01:04:02.969
helping yourself, this is your own finger.
If you help your own finger, you don’t help

01:04:02.969 --> 01:04:09.569
it in a different way than you help other
fingers. That means you become collective

01:04:09.569 --> 01:04:16.569
being, and you are. People like Abraham Lincoln,
as I said yesterday, and great people in this

01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:23.910
country established these great ideals of
liberty. And the liberty, they said that,

01:04:25.059 --> 01:04:32.059
even Roosevelt once said that “Poverty anywhere
is a threat to prosperity anywhere.” What

01:04:33.709 --> 01:04:39.819
at great thing to say, to feel that, that
oneness with others, that anywhere poverty

01:04:39.819 --> 01:04:43.319
is a threat to our prosperity!

01:04:43.319 --> 01:04:48.670
All this collectivity has been expressed by
your great men in this country, not only but

01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:55.670
the sense of responsibility because it is
on your shoulders, the responsibility. Responsibility

01:04:58.069 --> 01:05:05.069
of making others the Self, realize, is your
responsibility. You are the responsible nation,

01:05:07.459 --> 01:05:12.579
you are responsible for the whole universe,
whatever things you do here that goes outside.

01:05:12.579 --> 01:05:17.119
You took to rock ’n roll, people started
doing rock ’n roll, you did anything nonsensical

01:05:17.119 --> 01:05:19.890
that started going abroad. Anything nonsensical
you do here spreads everywhere because Americans

01:05:19.890 --> 01:05:25.660
are doing. Jeans, now everybody wears, even
in India! Imagine in that hot country they

01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:32.660
are wearing very strong, starched ones, and
they get all kinds of problems with that,

01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:37.869
circulation problems [INDISTINCT: I mean?],
but… “Americans are doing,” everybody

01:05:37.869 --> 01:05:39.789
is becoming American in India.

01:05:39.789 --> 01:05:44.670
That’s it, in every developing country you
have put your hand; you have interest in everyone,

01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:51.670
but should be done after realization when
you feel the pangs of others, you feel the

01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:59.549
heart, you feel the real pain of others within
yourself, and you do it, not because you want

01:06:00.469 --> 01:06:03.410
to do it for others, but do it because you
want to save yourself out of that pain. You

01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:10.190
do it for yourself. If somebody’s drowned
and you try to save a person who is drowned,

01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:13.910
then you don’t save him you actually are
saving yourself because something in you is

01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:18.930
getting drowned there. And that happens to
you when you become that collective being,

01:06:18.930 --> 01:06:25.190
when you become the Spirit, then it happens
to you. Before that, whatever you do is disgraceful,

01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:31.459
sometimes can be harmful, can be very ugly
and sometimes it can be so grotesque that

01:06:31.459 --> 01:06:33.989
people say, “All right, you keep your help
to yourself, we don’t want to have any more

01:06:33.989 --> 01:06:40.989
of this.” I mean you take away all the self-respect
of people.

01:06:41.099 --> 01:06:48.099
So one has to understand that you stand here
in this world, in this universe as a collective

01:06:49.809 --> 01:06:54.400
being, as the representative of that collective
being at this Vishuddhi Chakra and you have

01:06:54.400 --> 01:07:01.400
to give with your hands. For giving. This
applies to your hands and you must give, those

01:07:02.089 --> 01:07:07.390
hands which have never given are no good,
they are very insensitive hands, you must

01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:12.660
give, and that must come into you, and not
giving for giving’s sake, but Nirvach,,

01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:19.660
as they say, without any, any return about
it. Nothing, is just giving, just flowing,

01:07:19.989 --> 01:07:25.739
just like the Sun’s rays are coming to you,
they don’t want anything in return, do they?

01:07:25.739 --> 01:07:32.739
Just flowing. When that should happen, if
Sahaj Yoga takes to it, I hope it takes to

01:07:35.039 --> 01:07:40.469
America that Americans accept Sahaj Yog, that
it works out. You have already got all kinds

01:07:40.469 --> 01:07:46.069
of horrible people here. I don’t know how
you are going to work it out, but God willing,

01:07:46.069 --> 01:07:50.219
with your determination, I am sure.

01:07:50.219 --> 01:07:56.640
This is the first Unity Church I’m visiting
and I hope that in other Unity Churches also,

01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:02.839
it will be made convenient for Me and we can
save other people also, and they can become

01:08:02.839 --> 01:08:09.839
realized souls and they can become the Vishuddhi
Chakras, the responsible people, men of God,

01:08:14.759 --> 01:08:19.259
those who have to become prophets, that they
are responsible that they have to make others

01:08:19.259 --> 01:08:26.259
also prophets and save so many seekers who
are gathered in this great country of yours

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:35.410
because they know here it will happen, and
that they should be enabled to enter into

01:08:35.410 --> 01:08:38.850
the Kingdom of God because the time has come
for that.

01:08:38.850 --> 01:08:45.819
So we come up to Vishuddhi Chakra, and the
last center, chakra, here is the center of

01:08:45.819 --> 01:08:46.680
Christ.

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:53.680
[ASIDE: Should I go? If I do it tomorrow,
would be better. All right?]

01:08:58.799 --> 01:09:03.430
Tomorrow about Christ I’ll tell you because
I want to take one hour explaining Him very

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:10.410
well. I was very much impressed by your whole
idea about Christ, the unity, the integration

01:09:10.410 --> 01:09:17.410
and your symbols are very correct, everything
is just there, somebody has to just trigger

01:09:18.670 --> 01:09:25.670
it, and it will work out. First you must get
your realization, grow into it, develop your

01:09:29.890 --> 01:09:34.640
discrimination, you become your own guru,
and then everything that you are doing in

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:40.190
this Unity Church will have a great meaning,
you can prove it, you can prove it that there

01:09:40.190 --> 01:09:45.990
is God, there is Christ, there are all these
incarnations. Christ Himself has said that

01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:52.250
“Those who are not against Me are with Me.”
These are the people.

01:09:52.250 --> 01:09:59.200
And I’m sure one day it will happen that
Unity Church will show its own worth, its

01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:06.200
own explanation of its existence, why it came
into existence.

01:10:06.990 --> 01:10:13.990
Thank you very much. May God bless you.

01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:24.460
If you have any questions you may ask, and
then we’ll have the session for realization.

01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:35.920
Seeker: Sometimes in meditation and in chanting,
a person will be rocking. Would you consider

01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:52.470
that a negative thing?

01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:58.440
Warren: Sometimes in meditation people will
rock or move. Is this a negative thing?

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:04.210
Shri Mataji: Absolutely, absolutely. You should
not rock, there should be no movement, the

01:11:04.210 --> 01:11:09.110
eyes should be steady, there should be no
movement in the eyelids, nothing. This rocking

01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:16.110
is absolutely wrong. All these things should
not happen to you, that’s not meditation.

01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:23.210
Meditation is where you are absolutely normal,
you are always in meditation after realization,

01:11:23.210 --> 01:11:25.350
you are in meditation.

01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:31.980
Question: I’ve studied with Paramahansa
Yogananda the SRF, Self-Realization Fellowship,

01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:38.980
and one of the things they teach is to focus
the eyes, with the eyes closed only on the

01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:41.190
[INAUDIBLE].

01:11:41.190 --> 01:11:47.610
Shri Mataji: I must say that I don’t want
to start any controversy. That’s one thing

01:11:47.610 --> 01:11:54.610
sure, but I’ll tell you that proof of the
pudding is in the eating. Let’s go this

01:11:55.870 --> 01:12:00.990
way. First of all logically we should see,
we have to get baptism through here, not through

01:12:00.990 --> 01:12:06.490
here. Do we get baptism through here? If the
door is here what’s the use of breaking

01:12:06.490 --> 01:12:13.490
this window? And focusing and effort is not
going to give you realization, is wrong. You

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:22.890
see this pampers– human effort, you see
it pampers you that you can put in an effort.

01:12:22.890 --> 01:12:28.170
You cannot. One must accept this position:
we cannot put in an effort for a living thing.

01:12:28.170 --> 01:12:33.830
For example, as I told you, for a seed if
you have to sprout it you have to put it in

01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:38.390
the Mother Earth. You cannot pull it out,
isn’t it? Whatever you may try, you cannot

01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:45.390
pull it out and sprout. You cannot put in
any effort. Any effort is wrong, is against

01:12:48.230 --> 01:12:51.870
spontaneity and living things. So no effort
is needed as such.

01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:58.870
Lady: I’d like to ask Her about that center
where the immune bodies develop, at what age

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:08.120
and what can we do in order to make that immunity
get bigger or…

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:21.800
Warren: She says two questions. At what age
does the immune bodies start developing and

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.780
secondly is there any way in which you can
expand the capacity of the immune bodies?

01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:33.200
Shri Mataji: Of course, of course. Of course,
that is what Sahaj Yoga is. When you become

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:37.750
the truth, all untruth falls off, is that
is what Sahaj Yoga is; absolutely that is

01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:42.230
what it is. Tomorrow, I am going to tell you
about Christ and about cancer; about all these

01:13:42.230 --> 01:13:46.070
immune bodies how we fight them. That may
be day after tomorrow, I don’t know, but

01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:50.280
tomorrow, may not be, but day after tomorrow
I’ll tell you how to grow into it. Absolutely.

01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:57.280
You learn how to protect, you learn how to
fight. Absolutely. That is what happens after

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:05.830
realization then you must learn the divine
technique, not before realization. After realization,

01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:12.830
not before. Before it is connected what’s
the use of playing with it? It has to be connected

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.040
first.

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:17.160
What is it?

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:21.320
Warren: Any other questions?

01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:28.320
Man: What are the avenues available to keep
these channels open?

01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:35.890
Warren: What are the avenues available to
keep the channels open?

01:14:35.890 --> 01:14:42.890
Shri Mataji: To be your Spirit. And we will
let you know later on how to work it out,

01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:49.400
how to balance yourself, how the imbalances
are there. This I’ll do it on Wednesday.

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:55.760
I will tell you how to keep them clear, how
to keep your chakras clear, how to work it

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:58.970
out, everything I’ll tell you. And also
–

01:14:58.970 --> 01:15:03.640
[We don’t have a book about it, isn’t
it, but in any case –

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:04.000
Warren: We’ve got the “Advent.”

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:04.920
Shri Mataji: Oh yes. ]

01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:11.400
We have a very big book on this Sahaj Yoga,
which of course we do not sell to everyone,

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:18.400
but we’ll see about it. We’ll see about
it because you people are growing very fast.

01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:23.290
If you people really grow, then we’ll sell
it to you also, but normally we don’t sell

01:15:23.290 --> 01:15:23.920
it to everyone.

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:28.020
Question: Do you feel Hatha Yoga is necessary?

01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:34.070
Shri Mataji: Not at all, nothing. On the contrary
Hatha Yoga creates a problem, I told you in

01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:39.610
the morning, to a lady who was doing Hatha
Yoga. I told her how Hatha Yoga in the modern

01:15:39.610 --> 01:15:46.610
times means nothing but physical acrobats.
It is not that. Hatha Yoga was practiced about,

01:15:46.670 --> 01:15:52.230
I don’t know how many years back, about
eight thousand years back, when we had a different

01:15:52.230 --> 01:15:59.230
system of life, where children from five to
twenty-five lived with a guru who was a realized

01:15:59.350 --> 01:16:06.350
soul, and led a very celibate life. To such
an extent that, that university, any university

01:16:06.670 --> 01:16:13.670
– say somebody’s university was Vishwamitra,
then that realized soul was Vishwamitra and

01:16:14.110 --> 01:16:18.710
that university people could not marry, even
today they cannot marry. Even today they cannot

01:16:18.710 --> 01:16:23.860
marry each other. The celibacy of that kind
was present in those days. And in that time

01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:29.410
when you were completely celibate, you were
innocent, you were given these Ashtang Yogas.

01:16:29.410 --> 01:16:36.410
There are eightfold paths [DEL: of Sahaj]
of this Hatha Yoga, out of which eighth one

01:16:37.730 --> 01:16:44.110
is Yama-niyama where the discipline and things
are there to maintain a proper life that was

01:16:44.110 --> 01:16:51.110
given to them. And then after that when that
was done, the maintenance of the proper life

01:16:51.870 --> 01:16:57.830
and all that was taught, also they were told
the exercises when according to the movement

01:16:57.830 --> 01:17:01.120
of the Kundalini wherever was the problem.

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:07.410
Supposing the problem is in your particular
center, then you have to do that movement,

01:17:07.410 --> 01:17:12.540
that particular exercise you have to do. But
it’s, as I told you this morning, that your

01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:17.840
car has not started, you are still at home
and you are paying the toll for what? You

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:23.780
must move, to find out where is the obstruction,
then you pay the toll. And nowadays it is

01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:29.760
so absurd that we take [DEL: the Saha–]
the Hatha Yoga in such a manner that we take

01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:36.170
the whole medicine box without having any
disease and get diseased. It’s a big science.

01:17:36.170 --> 01:17:41.580
Is a very big science one has to understand
that everything is correlated: How is your

01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:46.980
center, which center is catching, what center
requires what kind of treatment, how to clear

01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:49.160
it, and this technique you will learn in no
time. It’s very simple, once you get your

01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:49.410
realization.

01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:55.590
Question: Is there anything that we can start
doing now?

01:17:55.590 --> 01:18:01.490
Shri Mataji: Yes, just now I’m going to
give you realization. All right? That’s

01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:04.830
it, that’s just like a seeker, just like
a seeker.

01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:05.140
[Warren: On the sheet it tells them how to
meditate as well.

01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:05.390
Shri Mataji: Oh that I will tell later.]

01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:06.970
Ha. Now what about you? You have been raising
your hand.

01:18:06.970 --> 01:18:13.970
Question: What kind of a… what kind of a
yoga did Lord Krishna practice?

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:20.060
Shri Mataji: Sahaj Yoga. [Shri Mataji chuckles.]

01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:26.380
Question: According to Yogananda, he said
that Lord Krishna practiced Kriya Yoga.

01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:29.520
Shri Mataji: Not at all, Is wrong. He, it
is just to apportion of himself to [INDISTINCT:

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:36.520
you.] You see, Shri Krishna, if I have time
I can tell them, He in His Gita, He has prescribed

01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:43.820
four things. But Krishna was an incarnation
of diplomacy; He was an incarnation of divine

01:18:44.370 --> 01:18:51.370
diplomacy we should say, because when he told
Arjuna that you find it within yourself, the

01:18:53.650 --> 01:18:58.490
first thing, – He was not a businessman,
so He told the best thing first. He said,

01:18:58.490 --> 01:19:03.230
“Find it within yourself the gyana, the
awareness.” In your awareness you should

01:19:03.230 --> 01:19:09.500
find it, you should find your Spirit, should
become that. This is the first thing He told.

01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:16.500
But he was, that time a mediocre, an intellectual
I should say, and he said that “You are

01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:22.490
telling me to fight the war and here You are
saying that you find yourself and you become

01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:28.090
yourself, and to be a witness!” What Shri
Krishna meant was that you become a witness,

01:19:28.090 --> 01:19:32.600
then the whole thing becomes a drama, but
he didn’t understand.

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:39.600
He, being a father, I give an analogy of a
father who is telling his son that, “The

01:19:40.490 --> 01:19:45.200
horse is behind the cart, so put the horse
in front so the cart will move.”

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:49.930
But the son is saying that “Why not sitting
down here I move the cart?”

01:19:49.930 --> 01:19:54.750
So he says, “All right, go ahead.” He
says, “All right, go ahead,” because if

01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:59.960
you tell them straightforward they don’t
listen to you so tell them in another way.

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:06.500
So the diplomacy, as the essence that you
give absurd conditions, such absurd conditions

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:10.890
that people discover later on and find that
it was absurd.

01:20:10.890 --> 01:20:17.890
So the absurd condition He said that the first
thing you do is to do your karmas, do what

01:20:22.830 --> 01:20:26.960
you want to do and put it at the lotus feet
of the Lord – is an absurd condition. You

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:33.880
cannot do it because your ego is intact, you
may believe, “I am serving the Lord.”

01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:39.030
You may believe it, “believe” is different
from reality, you are not. Because ego is

01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:44.500
there, and that’s why you feel hurt, sometimes
you take the credit. Unless and until you

01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:51.500
are realized, unless and until you become
a holy personality you’ll never say like

01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:56.500
that. After realization what do you say, “It’s
going, it’s coming, Mother it’s not working,

01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:59.840
it just doesn’t work.” “It,” you start
talking in a third person. You don’t say,

01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:06.840
“I’m giving you realization,” you don’t
say so. “It’s not working. It has worked.

01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:08.660
It has come up.”

01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:09.050
“What?”

01:21:09.050 --> 01:21:11.800
”Realization.” You don’t say “I.”

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:17.190
So you become an akarmi, means like the sun
shines, it doesn’t say, “I shine.” There

01:21:17.190 --> 01:21:23.690
is no karma attached, this was the first thing
He said. But this absurdity people never saw,

01:21:23.690 --> 01:21:27.670
and they – even today people say, “I am
serving the Lord.” But you are not even

01:21:27.670 --> 01:21:34.670
connected, how are you serving Him? That’s
one thing. Because there is ego, you are identified

01:21:36.980 --> 01:21:41.760
with ego; actually you are serving your ego.
Unless and until you become realized, you

01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:47.680
do not serve God. This is one point which
was absurd, He told. Then second point – this

01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:48.840
is Karma Yoga.

01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:55.840
The second point He said was, that “You
should do Bhakti Yoga.” Bhakti Yoga is that

01:21:56.420 --> 01:22:02.980
you should worship Him, worship God, pray
to Him. But as usual because He was diplomacy

01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:08.430
He put a very interesting word called Ananya.
You should do Ananya Bhakti. Ananya means

01:22:08.430 --> 01:22:15.430
“when there is not the other.” When there
is not the other, when you are not the other,

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:22.080
when you are one with God. That means all
those people who are talking, “Hare Rama,

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:26.570
Hare Krishna, Hare Rama, Hare Krishna” on
Oxford Street are not connected. They are

01:22:26.570 --> 01:22:33.570
spoiling their throat, will get throat cancers.
You are not yet connected, you should be ananya.

01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:38.860
Ananya means you should be realized; you should
be connected with God.

01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:45.810
Imagine, supposing your President Reagan,
I go to him and stand before his house and

01:22:45.810 --> 01:22:49.980
start calling, “Reagan, Reagan, Reagan,”
I’ll be arrested. I must have a proper protocol,

01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:55.690
I must have proper permission, I should have
a proper way of going there, isn’t it?

01:22:55.690 --> 01:23:01.800
Everybody starts calling God as if He’s
in his pocket. “God give me a job, give

01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:08.800
me money, give me a car, give me this,”
I mean, imagine. You have to be connected

01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:13.460
with God. That’s what He said very clearly,
“ananya,” but these people, these are

01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:16.190
blind people they cannot see through.

01:23:16.190 --> 01:23:23.190
Then the third thing He said that, “It happens
within you that you get these happenings,”

01:23:25.110 --> 01:23:32.110
is the Kundalini Yoga. He said that when the
Kundalini starts, the jalandhara bhanda and

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:38.780
all these bhandas take place when the Kundalini
rises. These granthis go into a particular

01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:43.640
kind of a formation like a car when you start
all the engines starts moving. So He described

01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:46.210
all the engine, how it moves.

01:23:46.210 --> 01:23:52.050
That, this Mr. Yogananda picked up and he
said He preached Kriya Yoga. That means if

01:23:52.050 --> 01:23:56.960
you, say, have a car which has stopped which
has not yet started, you move the wheel and

01:23:56.960 --> 01:24:03.960
you move all the machines, will it work? You
cannot do it. It happens automatically. It

01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:14.110
is spontaneous happening within us. When we
eat our food how the food is digested? Automatically.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:22.790
In the same way when Kundalini rises, to support
its rise all these bhandas and all these kriyas

01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:28.760
take place and kechari, also your tongue is
pulled in, so people they cut their tongues,

01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:35.650
put it back. Is that the way? Is absolutely
artificial, is stupid.

01:24:35.650 --> 01:24:42.570
To do like that, many people I have seen.
I don’t know the early ones who came, of

01:24:42.570 --> 01:24:47.870
Yogananda they had the tongues wagging like
that? Imagine by doing all these things, “take

01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:54.830
out your eyes, take out your nose.” This
is not the way. And that, “You suffer, you

01:24:54.830 --> 01:25:01.830
shave your heads, wear a kind of a cloth,”
you cannot. It’s a thing that’s living

01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:10.060
within you and acts in a living way. You cannot
just maneuver it artificially, you cannot.

01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:14.980
It has to start!. Like even this camera, you
see, a television, anything, this has to be

01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:21.360
put to the mains. You cannot start with your
finger the camera working, can you? The electricity

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:28.360
has to be there, in the same way energy of
Kundalini has to be there to work it out.

01:25:30.970 --> 01:25:34.560
This is absurd.

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:41.560
So the Kriya Yoga, which is described by Shri
Krishna, is the living process. He said, “Is

01:25:42.750 --> 01:25:49.120
the living tree.” I’m surprised. We can…
human beings are very great, I must say, the

01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:56.120
way they make a pai out of everyone. So all
these great incarnations came on this earth;

01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:05.040
they wrote it very clearly; they said everything
very clearly; it was very simple; there was

01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:11.990
nothing to be so much deluded – of course
he used a word like ananya. You see in any

01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:18.990
dictionary what is the meaning of word ananya
is, mean is “when is there is not the other.”

01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:26.590
What have we made of Christ, what have we
made of Krishna, what have we made of Rama?

01:26:26.590 --> 01:26:33.150
When I see this I’m amazed. But you can’t
make anything out of Me, because you will

01:26:33.150 --> 01:26:40.150
get your realization. After that, if you try
to do anything to Me, you lose your vibrations,

01:26:41.770 --> 01:26:42.560
straightforward.

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:44.500
I can tell you this much.

01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:51.500
There was a gentleman who got his realization
from Me, an Indian. Typically he went to New

01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:58.700
York, started his thing and then in Los Angeles
he started a Sahaj Yoga center, and he came

01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:05.530
back to see Me in Bombay, and the Sahaj Yogis
told that “He is just giving us a fit. Is

01:27:05.530 --> 01:27:09.830
horrible. His vibrations are horrible.”

01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:11.000
I said, “I know that, you don’t talk to
him.”

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.730
So I called him, I said, “What do you do?”

01:27:14.730 --> 01:27:21.730
“Oh, I have started a big thing there in
Los Angeles and in New York and this and that.”

01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:28.060
“All right, can I have a brochure?” You
won’t believe he had written, that for ordinary

01:27:28.060 --> 01:27:35.060
vibrations seventy-five dollars and for extraordinary,
special vibrations hundred and seventy-five

01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:36.320
dollars.

01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:41.510
So I said, “Oh God, what’s this?” I
said, “How do you do this way?”

01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:45.080
He says, “Yes Mother, that’s [DEL: what]
how we are to do. After all, I have to live.”

01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:49.810
I said, “You have to live, all right, you
do your work that you were doing. You were

01:27:49.810 --> 01:27:53.900
teaching something, you do that, but you cannot
sell these vibrations; I didn’t give you

01:27:53.900 --> 01:28:00.900
for selling. Did you buy from Me?” And he
wouldn’t believe. And he was very angry

01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:04.490
and then he went away.

01:28:04.490 --> 01:28:08.820
He said, “There’s a guru who is in Calicut,
He’s a very wonderful man.”

01:28:08.820 --> 01:28:10.500
I said, “You go and see him.”

01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:14.470
He went and saw him, and this guru wouldn’t
allow him to enter into his house. He threw

01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:19.400
stones at him. He wouldn’t allow him to
enter even the gate. So he went back to the

01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:25.820
station, so he was sitting down there, then
somebody met him from the guru, he said that

01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:32.090
“Guru was saying that, ‘he went and insulted
Mother and how does he come to be here? I’ll

01:28:32.090 --> 01:28:37.290
not see his face.’” Then he sat there
for three days, and he was allowed to go,

01:28:37.290 --> 01:28:43.600
and then guru sent a very good poem about
Me in Sanskrit language, which he read it

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:44.570
out to Me.

01:28:44.570 --> 01:28:51.570
But the fellow is just the same still. He’s
not changed; he’s just the same. Now he

01:28:53.540 --> 01:28:57.090
has no vibrations, he’s not a Sahaj yogi,
he has nothing to do, but he has an ashram,

01:28:57.090 --> 01:29:00.250
he’s making money out of it. Of course we
have withdrawn our photographs and everything

01:29:00.250 --> 01:29:06.080
but he’s just the same, what am I to do?
He is now making them stand on their heads

01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:12.540
and do all kinds of things. And he has more
people than you are here. That’s the best

01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:19.540
part of it. People are more attracted to these
things than to reality. Is very true.

01:29:20.770 --> 01:29:27.340
When I came last time to America there was
a lady. I told her that, “Your guru was

01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:29.720
believing in all miracles, and you better
not start it.”

01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:34.280
She said, “No, no, no, no. I want the ultimate,
I want the parama, I’m not going to go into

01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:34.640
it.”

01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:36.850
I said, “All right. Promise Me.”

01:29:36.850 --> 01:29:40.970
She said, “Yes.” But then she started
getting some sort of a rice falling from her

01:29:40.970 --> 01:29:47.190
hand and all that and then she started doing
her things, you see? She called people told

01:29:47.190 --> 01:29:52.260
them even the name of the horses which are
going to win, all sorts of things. And you

01:29:52.260 --> 01:29:59.260
won’t believe, when I went back to America
to My most embarrassed condition, I found

01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:07.360
that she had three thousand disciples falling
at her feet. And she was absolutely possessed.

01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:11.680
She came to Me and I told her, “What are
you doing?”

01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:13.770
She said, “Mother, this is the powers You
have given me.”

01:30:13.770 --> 01:30:17.780
I said, “I have never given you these powers
to beat people and tell them about horses.

01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:19.060
Is absurd.”

01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:23.360
She said, “But this is happening to me.”

01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:29.810
I said, “All supraconscious, all nonsense.”
She wouldn’t listen. I said, “All right,

01:30:29.810 --> 01:30:32.450
tell this gentleman about his future.”

01:30:32.450 --> 01:30:37.390
She told him something. He said , “It’s
all wrong, it’s not true.”

01:30:37.390 --> 01:30:40.810
I said, “Tell this lady.” She couldn’t
tell.

01:30:40.810 --> 01:30:45.090
So she said, “Mother, have you taken away
my powers?”

01:30:45.090 --> 01:30:47.420
I said, “If they were your powers, I would
have garlanded, I would have worshiped you,

01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:52.260
but they are not yours, they have gone, finished.”
But she would not give up, you see popularity,

01:30:52.260 --> 01:30:58.400
she was on with it. Now only thing is she’s
in a lunatic asylum.

01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:05.400
So all these things they do, they know how
to make these things, they are so superficial.

01:31:10.180 --> 01:31:14.670
They don’t know what injuries they are doing
to themselves and to others.

01:31:14.670 --> 01:31:19.990
Now, who were asking some question?

01:31:19.990 --> 01:31:26.990
Man. I wanted to ask You about the meditations
from the Maharishi Mahayoga, what Your opinion

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:30.550
was.

01:31:30.550 --> 01:31:36.930
Shri Mataji: Now again the controversy, again
the controversy, the less said the better.

01:31:36.930 --> 01:31:39.000
All right?

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.090
Man: The what?

01:31:40.090 --> 01:31:47.090
Shri Mataji: The less said the better. For
example, the mantras he gives you. You know

01:31:48.740 --> 01:31:53.790
what they mean, one of them, inga ? It means
“the tail of the scorpion.” Now where

01:31:53.790 --> 01:32:00.270
is the scorpion and where is the tail? When
the Kundalini has started, then you should

01:32:00.270 --> 01:32:06.050
know which center it is catching and what
mantra to be said. It is not that you can

01:32:06.050 --> 01:32:13.050
just give a mantra and charge three hundred
pounds, and people do pay. And this flying

01:32:13.050 --> 01:32:17.400
squad that he has started, the head of that
flying squad here he is, is sitting down here,

01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:22.550
he will tell you. The head of that where he
went and learnt from him flying, so called,

01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:26.230
he suffered from epilepsy, his wife suffered
from epilepsy, his daughter suffered from

01:32:26.230 --> 01:32:33.230
epilepsy, and they came to Me and they wrote
to him about Me, in that miserable condition.

01:32:34.450 --> 01:32:38.690
He was the head; he was going to teach them
flying.

01:32:38.690 --> 01:32:43.280
I told him, “Why don’t you ask your guru
to go on this leaning tower of Pisa and make

01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:50.280
him fly? And you pay him some money for that,
will be good idea.” They paid three thousand

01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:58.520
pounds for flying. You are not going to become
birds now, are you?

01:33:00.790 --> 01:33:05.630
But it is very difficult, you know, to accept
really because you have paid so much money.

01:33:05.630 --> 01:33:11.410
This is like, “We have paid it, so better
have it.” You see whatever… Like you go

01:33:11.410 --> 01:33:18.410
to a restaurant and you pay for it, and may
be bad but you eat it. You see, after all,

01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:20.550
you have paid for it.

01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:24.780
That’s human nature, isn’t it? Oh, it’s
terrible. It’s terrible, and difficult to

01:33:24.780 --> 01:33:29.210
give realization to people from all these
gurus, I can tell you, Yogananda… or this,

01:33:29.210 --> 01:33:32.450
what’s his name is? This Bhandasura’s
name, what is his name?

01:33:32.450 --> 01:33:33.040
Warren: Muktananda.

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:40.040
Shri Mataji: Muktananda. I know them very
well, I know them. I’ve known them for ages,

01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:44.880
and they know Me too.

01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:47.600
Yes?

01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:54.600
Lady: Are there other sources where you can
reach your realization other than through

01:33:58.920 --> 01:33:59.170
You?

01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:00.130
[Warren repeats the question.]

01:34:00.130 --> 01:34:04.020
Shri Mataji: Through Me? It’s not a question
of through Me or anything; it’s through

01:34:04.020 --> 01:34:06.310
your Kundalini, is your Kundalini within you.

01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:08.880
Lady: Is there someone else that can guide
you or…?

01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:13.530
Shri Mataji: I don’t know, I haven’t seen
many. I wish somebody could, like – you

01:34:13.530 --> 01:34:18.990
see people are very much hurt to see that
I’m doing it. I said, “Baba, you do it.

01:34:18.990 --> 01:34:21.090
I’ll be very happy to retire, really.”

01:34:21.090 --> 01:34:22.610
They said, “Why You, Mother?”

01:34:22.610 --> 01:34:27.710
I said, “Really, I don’t know why I was
chosen for this. It’s a thankless job. You

01:34:27.710 --> 01:34:34.710
must have tremendous patience, I tell you.
The day I retire my husband will pay you for

01:34:36.570 --> 01:34:39.630
that. I can assure you.”

01:34:39.630 --> 01:34:46.630
He’s telling Me that “You are trying to
put patches to the heavens which are falling.”

01:34:47.790 --> 01:34:54.790
He doesn’t believe that I can do it. Is
a thankless job, absolutely a thankless job.

01:34:55.420 --> 01:34:58.950
But what to do?

01:34:58.950 --> 01:35:05.950
Once I did feel little frustrated, and I said,
“Let it be now. Doesn’t matter, let the

01:35:06.930 --> 01:35:13.460
destruction come in.” And then you know
this clever man, he brought a photograph of

01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:18.820
Mine, with My eyes so compassionate, such
compassion flowing, I said, “Better do it.

01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:25.090
It’s You, what can You do? You can’t get
out of it, that’s what You are.”

01:35:25.090 --> 01:35:31.220
So I have to do it, My children, I have to
do it. If you could do it, I’ll be very

01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:36.570
happy. Any one, I’ll be extremely happy
and retire.

01:35:36.570 --> 01:35:42.290
Warren softly: Other Sahaja Yogis can.

01:35:42.290 --> 01:35:49.290
Shri Mataji: Ha, Of course! Other Sahaj yogis
can give you realization. For example Warren

01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:55.090
himself has given realization to I don’t
know how many thousand. But I know of a person

01:35:55.090 --> 01:36:01.450
who has given realization to more than ten
thousand people, in India. Yes! Yes, yes,

01:36:01.450 --> 01:36:05.710
you can give realization, you can give it,
all right?

01:36:05.710 --> 01:36:12.330
Man: Is the lotus position any special advantage
over sitting normally?

01:36:12.330 --> 01:36:15.550
Warren: Is the lotus position any special
advantage?

01:36:15.550 --> 01:36:21.850
Shri Mataji: Not in Sahaj Yoga, not in Sahaj
Yoga. You see now God has decided to give

01:36:21.850 --> 01:36:27.920
you in any position you sit; He has to save
His creation. Many people can’t even sit

01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:33.370
on the ground, so they are not to be forced
now. Whatever position you have, you are all

01:36:33.370 --> 01:36:40.230
right. You drink, all right. You take drugs,
all right. You are a thief, all right. Any

01:36:40.230 --> 01:36:47.230
kind, come along. Once you get realization
these things will drop out. This is the trick.

01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:55.380
Better come along and have it. There’s no
position required, nothing required, only

01:37:14.750 --> 01:37:21.750
the desire to
be the Spirit, that’s all.

01:37:56.560 --> 01:38:03.560
First one man: We’ll take it.

01:38:15.570 --> 01:38:22.570
[several people start to echo the request:
“We’ll take it.”]

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:35.460
Warren: They want it.

01:38:35.460 --> 01:38:39.540
Shri Mataji: Now they want it, that’s all.

01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:43.020
Man: May we have it.

01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:50.020
Shri Mataji: So, that’s all, that’s the
best way. All right?

01:39:41.670 --> 01:39:48.670
Now those who got

01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:47.240
it yesterday are here, some of them, and those
who have come for

01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:29.860
the first time are also here.

01:44:36.190 --> 01:44:43.190
Two ladies: what’s wrong with that? What
was that again?

01:45:07.550 --> 01:45:14.550
Warren: They just want
You
to repeat that, “those that have..”

01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:44.270
Shri Mataji: No, yesterday some people got
realization and

01:49:56.420 --> 01:50:03.420
some of

01:51:06.380 --> 01:51:13.380
you are new people. We’ll have to, later
on, see them, those who are new. And those

01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:48.280
who got realization, specially yesterday,
I
would like to meet them. As yesterday I couldn’t

01:51:59.950 --> 01:52:06.950
meet them. So I would like to meet them and
those who are new, also we’ll if we can

01:52:57.990 --> 01:53:04.990
work it out…

01:53:33.810 --> 01:53:40.810
[VIDEO RECORDING ENDS]
