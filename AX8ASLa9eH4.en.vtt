00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
From there Angapuri you remember we have been near Brahmapuri and from there even you can

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.520
walk down if you want to Brahmapuri.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.080
Your cars can go that side they can walk down.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.240
So Angapuri if you remember next to Brahmapuri you can walk back from there if you like and

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:27.680
your buses can go ahead to Brahmapuri.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:35.120
So you get down at Angapur and let the buses go ahead only take out your torches and in

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.040
any case you must keep one dress handy for yourself.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.720
So then it is easy because every time I don't want you to get down with the luggage and

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.240
again get ticked off you see.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.720
Now this time is going to be for three days in Brahmapuri this day so it would be much

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.666
better.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:15.600
So they are saying after lunch if you leave you will be quite in time for the procession.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:27.200
I hope you like this place very much and also I think I brought down the temperature

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.280
all right for you.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:48.519
It was quite quite cold but now it's all right no wind is blowing.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:07.532
You see human mind is such I have seen that it always creates an objection, burocratic.

00:03:08.512 --> 00:03:12.752
Like you tell them one thing, they said "no, that is not possible"

00:03:12.755 --> 00:03:17.232
Then you tell them another, "that is not possible", this solution "that is not possible".

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:26.300
One telling them they said "no, but is not possible, nothing is possible under the sun".

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.330
So my job is to give solution and your is to say "no"

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:42.660
But is a thing that goes again the flow, say the river is flowing and the stone has a job to stop the river. 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:50.500
It can never stop of course. But creates a funny ripple. So better learn

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:58.240
to flow with the whole thing it will work out it works out and because of this mental

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:06.520
attitude you see never find solutions if our mental attitude is such we'll never find

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.520
solutions if our mental attitude is such no we have to find a solution we are going to

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:20.720
give mother some solution. Then the whole thing changes but this is not possible that is not

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.960
possible this cannot be done that cannot be done so all the gods also give up this all

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:34.240
right don't do anything but it is an escapisism is a kind of an escape.
