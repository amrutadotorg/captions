01:01:52.489 --> 01:01:57.289
I am sorry, I had to speak in Marathi
language

01:01:57.314 --> 01:02:03.789
because I had to tell them something
which I don't want you to know.

01:02:14.301 --> 01:02:18.472
Today is a great day, I should say
in a way,

01:02:18.956 --> 01:02:25.865
because I am going to tell you
one thing great.

01:02:25.890 --> 01:02:33.603
That is Shri Gyaneshwara - in Marathi
they call it 'Dnyaneshwara' -

01:02:34.972 --> 01:02:42.102
He was the incarnation of Kartikeya.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:56.849
And Saraswati, who was a virgin,
she looked after Him like Her own son.

01:02:56.874 --> 01:03:04.691
He was the brother of Shri Ganapati
but She looked after Him.

01:03:04.716 --> 01:03:08.919
And then also there’s description how
He was born and all those (things),

01:03:08.944 --> 01:03:12.087
is very interesting.

01:03:12.112 --> 01:03:22.371
But here in this place, in this Maharashtra,
He took His incarnation.

01:03:22.396 --> 01:03:28.151
And also there were many great, great,
very great saints

01:03:28.176 --> 01:03:37.524
in so many numbers took place,
took their birth in this Maharashtra.

01:03:38.862 --> 01:03:46.072
But such horrible people, they tortured
their lives.

01:03:46.097 --> 01:03:49.083
Worse than Christian Inquisition I tell you;

01:03:49.108 --> 01:03:53.346
worse than any inquisition anywhere.

01:03:53.371 --> 01:03:56.873
Individually they attacked.

01:03:56.898 --> 01:04:02.399
And that same people are born again

01:04:03.941 --> 01:04:09.559
in this great country of Maharashtra.

01:04:09.584 --> 01:04:13.064
They are very talented people; they write
very well.

01:04:13.089 --> 01:04:17.434
Their language is so rich.

01:04:17.459 --> 01:04:24.423
You can see that, what description

01:04:25.985 --> 01:04:36.952
of a realized soul, given by Gyaneshwara,
is so beautiful.

01:04:38.251 --> 01:04:45.775
He says that, "The moon doesn’t run
after moonlight,

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:51.069
the sun doesn’t run after sunlight.

01:04:51.094 --> 01:04:59.752
In that way a realized soul doesn’t bother
about his own glory.

01:05:02.575 --> 01:05:09.372
The sun shines till it shines, then it
takes back all his rays.

01:05:09.397 --> 01:05:16.431
Whatever work the rays have to do
they do it. And the sun is just watching,

01:05:16.699 --> 01:05:20.471
watching all the work, then he takes
them back.

01:05:20.496 --> 01:05:28.154
And he gets completely contained within
himself”.

01:05:28.179 --> 01:05:34.805
Samavun ghene, completely contained
within himself.

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:40.797
The description He has given of realized
souls

01:05:40.822 --> 01:05:47.334
is so beautiful, if you could just
experience it.

01:05:47.359 --> 01:05:51.847
Namadeva, who was born much later,
said that

01:05:51.872 --> 01:06:01.303
even one line of Gyanesha [Gyaneshwara]
if you could experience,

01:06:01.328 --> 01:06:03.897
you had that.

01:06:03.922 --> 01:06:08.046
I wish you all could read Amrutanubhava
in English,

01:06:08.071 --> 01:06:14.072
understanding how He describes
a realized soul,

01:06:14.097 --> 01:06:18.226
and you'll find that within yourself
it has happened.

01:06:18.271 --> 01:06:21.843
You are different from others very much.

01:06:21.868 --> 01:06:31.985
You'll be amazed how you have got
such beautiful description of your Self.

01:06:32.010 --> 01:06:39.061
I was talking about Maharashtrians;
they are extremely talented people.

01:06:39.086 --> 01:06:45.298
See their music. In music no-one can
beat them.

01:06:45.323 --> 01:06:50.482
See their drama. In drama no-one can
beat them.

01:06:51.359 --> 01:06:56.427
You can see from films. In Maharashtra
only

01:06:56.452 --> 01:07:00.222
great films were created.

01:07:00.247 --> 01:07:06.637
The another one is Bengal, which is,

01:07:06.662 --> 01:07:13.008
I would say, different but of the same
level.

01:07:13.033 --> 01:07:17.506
It's such a talented people here,

01:07:17.531 --> 01:07:23.235
it shows that God has a special blessing
for these two,

01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:29.292
and, should be, Maharashtrians should rise
very high.

01:07:29.317 --> 01:07:34.610
But all the time complaining about others,
talking ill of others,

01:07:34.635 --> 01:07:38.250
and something very low they do.
I'm surprised that,

01:07:38.285 --> 01:07:44.650
I hope you don't pick up anything from them.

01:07:44.675 --> 01:07:53.253
And also the fussiness that is of the North
Indians;

01:07:53.278 --> 01:07:57.117
that's also not a very good thing.

01:07:57.142 --> 01:08:03.181
It's surprising how you people have adjusted
yourself to this country,

01:08:03.206 --> 01:08:08.047
which has all kinds of parasites.

01:08:08.072 --> 01:08:15.524
Because you live with vibrations, you feel
the vibrations.

01:08:15.549 --> 01:08:20.172
It's something so great to see you all here,

01:08:20.197 --> 01:08:27.220
and I'm telling them that they should try
to understand you people.

01:08:27.245 --> 01:08:33.781
Really I’m very proud of you all who have
come all the way here.

01:08:33.806 --> 01:08:43.687
In this puja I am thinking of so many great
saints who were born,

01:08:43.712 --> 01:08:50.436
who were great gurus, mahagurus. Of course
Gyanesha,

01:08:50.461 --> 01:09:01.047
I must say, is the king of all those high,
highly evolved souls, no doubt.

01:09:01.072 --> 01:09:09.016
So we are now having a puja on the twenty
-fourth of December

01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:14.591
because it's a Datta Jayanti, Dattatreya's
birth.

01:09:14.616 --> 01:09:18.381
And so we'll be having on the twenty-fourth
night.

01:09:18.406 --> 01:09:24.487
In any case it's a Christmas Eve. We could
all start with that.

01:09:24.512 --> 01:09:30.862
And also Dattatreya, who took His form
in Maharashtra.

01:09:30.887 --> 01:09:35.469
Maharashtrians understand Dattatreya.

01:09:35.494 --> 01:09:41.233
They understand the Nath Panthis.
These Nathas went all over.

01:09:41.258 --> 01:09:50.238
They went to Kiev. You'll be amazed,
they went even up to Bolivia,

01:09:50.263 --> 01:09:58.656
those who are from Maharashtra, from Rahuri.
Can you imagine?

01:09:58.681 --> 01:10:03.096
Such great people they were,

01:10:03.121 --> 01:10:08.609
and that is what I expect to happen
in this Maharashtra.

01:10:08.634 --> 01:10:16.470
And I'm sure one day I'll be very much
happy with all of them; not few.

01:10:16.495 --> 01:10:20.539
There are some very great Maharashtrians,
no doubt,

01:10:20.565 --> 01:10:27.514
but all of them have to join together
because I talk of synthesis,

01:10:27.539 --> 01:10:30.783
not of divisive method.

01:10:30.808 --> 01:10:37.082
I hope they understand the inner feeling
that I have,

01:10:37.107 --> 01:10:46.306
otherwise all the good diamonds will be
selected

01:10:46.331 --> 01:10:51.574
and the ones which are defective will be
thrown away.

01:10:53.067 --> 01:11:00.056
What's the use? But all of them are capable
of achieving any height.

01:11:00.081 --> 01:11:03.615
They may belong to any caste, community,
doesn't matter;

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:07.643
but they are born in Maharashtra,

01:11:07.668 --> 01:11:12.003
which is such a great country.

01:11:12.028 --> 01:11:15.198
So today they wanted to do Mahalakshmi,

01:11:15.223 --> 01:11:19.013
this thing, we already have Mahalakshmi
temple.

01:11:19.038 --> 01:11:24.082
And they have a great blessing of Mahalakshmi
also, in a way,

01:11:24.107 --> 01:11:29.610
but they lack: one is the wisdom,

01:11:29.635 --> 01:11:35.470
and the second the spirit of Kartikeya.

01:11:36.317 --> 01:11:44.151
The spirit of Kartikeya - that

01:11:48.317 --> 01:11:54.984
pure, absolute dynamism

01:11:55.783 --> 01:12:03.338
which doesn't indulge into nonsensical things
and useless things;

01:12:03.363 --> 01:12:09.392
which shows results.
May God bless you all!
