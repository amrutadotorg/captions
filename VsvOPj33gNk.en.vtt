00:16:17.493 --> 00:16:29.493
Today you all have expressed the desire to do a puja to Shri Mahalakshmi,

00:16:29.493 --> 00:16:35.325
but here in Maharashtra, Shri Mahalakshmi is worshipped regularly

00:16:35.325 --> 00:16:46.035
and she has appeared here in Maharashtra

00:16:46.035 --> 00:17:21.790
but I had an immense desire to tell you all about Shri Kartikeya

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:36.385
because he took birth in this Maharashtra, he was Shri Gyaneshwara himself,

00:17:36.385 --> 00:17:45.191
I have not said anything about this until now because Maharashtrians find it difficult to understand it.

00:17:45.191 --> 00:17:53.165
Shri Kartikeya himself took birth in this Maharashtra

00:17:53.165 --> 00:18:14.817
and he wrote such great and deep scriptures like Gyaneshwari and Amrutanubhava.

00:18:14.817 --> 00:18:31.831
You can ask a question by putting your attention to see if Shri Gyaneshwara was an incarnation of Shri Kartikeya

00:18:31.831 --> 00:18:46.734
and you will find yourself in an ocean of beautiful, joyful cool breeze.

00:18:46.734 --> 00:19:00.829
I never told such a big thing like this in Maharashtra, because of the change in nature of Maharashtrian people now.

00:19:00.829 --> 00:19:06.161
Maybe because of all the horrible politicians we had here,

00:19:06.161 --> 00:19:22.613
and it might have influenced the Maharashtrians, (and Shri Kartikeya means, being in here, quite simple Maharashtrian……… a bit unclear.)

00:19:22.613 --> 00:19:28.379
We are someone great,

00:19:28.379 --> 00:19:36.101
it was very true what these people were telling me just now, that there were 40 IAS officers had come

00:19:36.101 --> 00:19:47.691
and there were three policemen on horseback, from where I came, so I asked who had come, they told me that the chief secretary himself had come.

00:19:47.691 --> 00:19:57.283
The Governor himself of that place said to me that if I don’t pay proper respect to you Shri Mataji, then these people would throw me out.

00:19:57.283 --> 00:20:02.932
This is the level of understanding in those people,

00:20:02.932 --> 00:20:16.572
and there Shri Gyaneshwara did not take his birth (unclear about the place Shri Mataji was talking about). Now I understand why he wanted to take his birth in Maharashtra.

00:20:16.572 --> 00:20:24.346
By the age of only 23, he had enough of Maharashtra and decided to take Samadhi.

00:20:24.346 --> 00:20:35.780
The way the Saints were tortured in this Maharashtra, nowhere else they were tortured like that.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:39.833
They feel that they have done something great,

00:20:39.833 --> 00:20:47.108
but after The Saints has died then they will build temples for them, and sing songs in their name.

00:20:47.108 --> 00:20:51.933
All this is just a nonsensical business to pass the time.

00:20:51.933 --> 00:20:58.540
All these years, this Maharashtra is my Motherland, my mother tongue.

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:08.193
Shivaji Maharaj has said to awaken the Dharma of oneself

00:21:08.193 --> 00:21:19.224
and then Gyaneshwara himself has already said that the world should see the sunrise of the Dharma of oneself.

00:21:19.224 --> 00:21:28.078
And then Shivaji Maharaj said those same words and that same work I am carrying forward.

00:21:28.078 --> 00:21:43.307
So that the universal religion of oneself should be awakened, and it should take place in this Maharashtra first,

00:21:43.307 --> 00:21:47.501
because Gyaneshwara has told that to people in Maharashtra first of all.

00:21:47.501 --> 00:21:54.829
Whatever I said about Maharashtra yesterday, you do not feel bad about it,

00:21:54.829 --> 00:22:03.803
I mean to say that you go on thinking that Shri Mataji was talking about this person or that person.

00:22:03.803 --> 00:22:11.924
You need to think about yourself, that means ‘Introspection’.

00:22:11.924 --> 00:22:17.873
What great work have we done to feel so great about,

00:22:17.873 --> 00:22:29.093
thinking that we had Saint Namadeva and so many great Saints here, and saying, ‘Shri Mataji herself has said it’, but you are not the Saints.

00:22:29.093 --> 00:22:36.491
It will be like there is a beautiful Lotus in a pond

00:22:36.491 --> 00:22:43.992
and a frog living inside it thinking that ‘he is somebody so great because he lives in such beautiful lotus’.

00:22:43.992 --> 00:22:49.229
Exactly that kind of thinking is quite a lot in Maharashtra, you should all take a note of that.

00:22:49.229 --> 00:22:55.518
The kind of behaviour I have seen here (in Maharashtra) never seen it anywhere else in the world.

00:22:55.518 --> 00:22:59.770
The first thing is the tendency of quarrelling,

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:06.484
I get so fed up some time, that I said now going to allow only one puja, and no more.

00:23:06.484 --> 00:23:15.862
We have built this beautiful Ashram here in Ganapatipule,

00:23:15.862 --> 00:23:25.788
so they have got a problem with that, such filthy people, they do not understand anything.

00:23:25.788 --> 00:23:32.722
They think ‘they live in the land of Saints’, and also have ‘Ashtavinaykas’,

00:23:32.722 --> 00:23:37.520
also have ‘The three and half Swayambhus of The Goddess’.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:47.552
All these people must have dared to appear here to cleanse this place, and I also have dared to work here.

00:23:47.552 --> 00:23:52.741
I am so surprised to see what these people been up to,

00:23:52.741 --> 00:24:02.297
one gentleman who I never even seen his face, without my permission he arranged a procession,

00:24:02.297 --> 00:24:07.858
someone else has puja done to himself under my name,

00:24:07.858 --> 00:24:19.514
I never seen such kind of nonsense anywhere else, not even in Madras, or in Bengal.

00:24:19.514 --> 00:24:24.231
There is no fear of God, they will go on doing whatever they feel like.

00:24:24.231 --> 00:24:29.891
There were some bad people, they could have behaved according to Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:29.891 --> 00:24:36.504
I told them that they should not stay in Sahaja Yoga, for now, they should put themselves right first.

00:24:36.504 --> 00:24:44.544
So they did not like that, they said, ‘Shri Mataji talks about love and then why does she get angry with us’.

00:24:44.544 --> 00:24:51.543
I am a Mother and I have to tell whatever is good for you,

00:24:51.543 --> 00:24:59.101
and I do, at some places, I do not have to tell anything, there is no need for it.

00:24:59.101 --> 00:25:09.177
Some ‘great’ people, who always have to be in the front,

00:25:09.177 --> 00:25:15.787
they will make a point of showing that they have specially come from Thane with one flower in their hand,

00:25:15.787 --> 00:25:21.345
and I am going to give it to Mataji myself,

00:25:21.345 --> 00:25:27.831
they look like they have just come from a mental asylum,

00:25:27.831 --> 00:25:37.564
so why is it like this in Maharashtra, I do not understand.

00:25:37.564 --> 00:25:42.457
The land is so pure here because there have been so many Saints,

00:25:42.457 --> 00:25:46.553
and even more so because of Ashtavinayakas

00:25:46.553 --> 00:25:51.808
and top of all that there are three and a half Swayambhus of The Goddesses,

00:25:51.808 --> 00:25:57.556
it is such a pure land, so why then do such horrible things happen here?

00:25:57.556 --> 00:26:00.470
There was one gentleman who was possessed,

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:07.886
so I told him to keep away from Sahaja Yoga,

00:26:07.886 --> 00:26:12.849
so he started his Sahaja Yoga of his own,

00:26:12.849 --> 00:26:27.637
he did not want to see that there is something wrong with him, but go on thinking that he is somebody very great, thinking that, ‘now I will show them’.

00:26:27.637 --> 00:26:34.157
His wife went on telling everyone that ‘my husband is much greater than Mataji’

00:26:34.157 --> 00:26:43.167
I was really surprised to know all these strange things.

00:26:43.167 --> 00:26:48.279
Such a thing never happened anywhere else.

00:26:48.279 --> 00:26:57.282
Also we have these Marathi Newspapers, Hindi and English newspapers are much better than that.

00:26:57.282 --> 00:27:04.602
They go on writing whatever they like (Marathi Newspapers)

00:27:04.602 --> 00:27:09.745
Quarreling amongst each other is the nature of the Maharashtrian.

00:27:09.745 --> 00:27:21.467
OK whatever it was, but now you are in Sahaja Yoga!

00:27:21.467 --> 00:27:30.143
Still, there is so much jealously, fighting, pulling each other down, snobbish behaviour, so they will say that ‘we are old Sahaja yogis’,

00:27:30.143 --> 00:27:35.136
and these are new in Sahaja Yoga, so they don’t know anything.

00:27:35.136 --> 00:27:42.643
Slowly the people from North India have started to come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:27:42.643 --> 00:27:46.834
but after seeing the situation here (Maharashtra) they started to go away.

00:27:46.834 --> 00:27:54.169
When I went to Pune, there were some people from Punjab, who had come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:27:54.169 --> 00:28:01.688
so they said Shri Mataji what are you doing with these Maharashtrian people, they just want to create problems for everyone.

00:28:01.688 --> 00:28:06.128
I felt very bad to hear that, I thought how can these people say this?

00:28:06.128 --> 00:28:12.493
I said to them (Punjabis) what do you think of yourself?

00:28:12.493 --> 00:28:18.860
But today there are about 8 to 10 very good strong Sahaja yogi’s.

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:28.108
They have built an Ashram in Delhi, and you will be surprised to know that every day, before going to work,

00:28:28.108 --> 00:28:40.293
from ten miles away they will come by car or by bus, there are at least 100 people come for meditation.

00:28:40.293 --> 00:29:00.453
We are very blessed here, blessed by The Goddess!

00:29:00.453 --> 00:29:09.973
! We are very clever in doing the work perfectly well outwardly,

00:29:09.973 --> 00:29:14.021
but when are we going to get awakened from inside?

00:29:14.021 --> 00:29:19.780
Without getting awakened from within, you are not going to understand yourself.

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:30.200
You are not going to be able to know the intensity of me without getting to know yourself first.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:34.917
Just now what he told you, which I asked him to tell you,

00:29:34.917 --> 00:29:38.103
because I could not get myself to say these things.

00:29:38.103 --> 00:29:42.215
Now, these people (foreigners) who have gone much deeper in Sahaja Yoga,

00:29:42.215 --> 00:29:45.210
who used to take drugs, take alcohol and all kinds of things,

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:52.009
have such great heights, and the Maharashtrians just busy fighting among each other, so what to say?

00:29:52.009 --> 00:29:59.274
They say that Mataji gets angry with us, so what should I suppose to do? If not get angry, should I suppose to garland you?

00:29:59.274 --> 00:30:05.414
Not just experts in quarrelling but they are also experts in gossiping.

00:30:05.414 --> 00:30:18.970
Just to pass the time they will go on gossiping.

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:34.695
Then if nothing else, they will start saying that Mataji does not give any money for anything these days, so we have to pay extra money.

00:30:34.695 --> 00:30:42.876
I have myself been paying for everything, right from your food, accommodation, I have tried to pay for everything,

00:30:42.876 --> 00:30:48.264
and still you people go on saying such things.

00:30:48.264 --> 00:30:52.981
Do you think I am some politician or what?

00:30:52.981 --> 00:31:05.622
And then they will ask me that Mataji why do we have so many earthquakes and other disasters?

00:31:05.622 --> 00:31:16.462
I have never seen so many drunkards anywhere else as much I have seen in Maharashtra,

00:31:16.462 --> 00:31:27.817
you will not find it in Delhi (drunks) not even one, not even in a foreign country,

00:31:27.817 --> 00:31:36.331
but in this Maharashtra where ever you go you will find drunks.

00:31:36.331 --> 00:31:43.235
It is like this from the beginning, when I went to Rahuri once,

00:31:43.235 --> 00:31:53.015
there was a big road going up, and when we stopped the car there and what I could see, they were dropping dead like flies,

00:31:53.015 --> 00:31:56.799
I thought what is going on here, is there some disease like cholera or something?

00:31:56.799 --> 00:32:08.609
Wearing a white hat, white Kurta, and dropping dead like flies!

00:32:08.609 --> 00:32:21.529
I said what is going on here? So they told me that there is a place called Indira Nagari where you can buy very cheap alcohol.

00:32:21.529 --> 00:32:27.702
Big number of people here drink alcohol.

00:32:27.702 --> 00:32:35.136
If you go to Delhi, you could see not so many people drink alcohol,

00:32:35.136 --> 00:32:38.491
some people even avoid going to places where people are drinking alcohol.

00:32:38.491 --> 00:32:48.408
But here everybody drinks, where ever you go, to any party, anywhere if they do not get drunk then they won’t be Maharashtrians!

00:32:48.408 --> 00:32:57.053
You know, we did not even know what alcohol was when we were growing up, did not know what colour it was supposed to be.

00:32:57.053 --> 00:33:03.032
So, if you question anybody about their drinking, they will say,

00:33:03.032 --> 00:33:09.331
look such and such person was 70 years old and he used to drink alcohol, so I said is that so, then go and put up his statue.

00:33:09.331 --> 00:33:12.674
This is the situation here now.

00:33:12.674 --> 00:33:22.188
When we were very young at the age of seven we took on a fight to close the shops where they sold alcohol.

00:33:22.188 --> 00:33:33.718
Here leave alone alcohol shops, some such people can’t live without alcohol.

00:33:33.718 --> 00:33:44.807
If I say a word against alcohol, then people will be after my life, you can not say a word against it.

00:33:44.807 --> 00:33:58.172
These are all the journalists, and there are all people in business, it is really surprising.

00:33:58.172 --> 00:34:02.534
In a place like Lucknow, where there was a person like Wajid Ali Shah,

00:34:02.534 --> 00:34:14.413
he was a Nawab, there they have such softness in their nature, their language is full of humility, their nature is so humble.

00:34:14.413 --> 00:34:21.934
I was so surprised, they will talk ill about this person or that person, (talking about Maharashtrians),

00:34:21.934 --> 00:34:30.360
they will send me letters after letters, and such horrible letters, about someone’s character and this and that, I am so fed up of it.

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:34.348
If a letter has come from Maharashtra then I just tell them to burn it.

00:34:34.348 --> 00:34:39.829
Now what to say in front of Saint Gyanadeva here,

00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:45.800
at the age of just 23 years he took Samadhi,

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:51.983
they say that Gyaneshwara never criticized anyone,

00:34:51.983 --> 00:35:03.372
why would anyone do that, there was no point in wasting time doing it, that is why he did not criticize anyone,

00:35:03.372 --> 00:35:10.316
but he talked about the situation there, he talked about people in that situation, but who is going to understand that,

00:35:10.316 --> 00:35:14.072
it is not something these Maharashtrians will understand.

00:35:14.072 --> 00:35:20.859
I am not saying that I have anybody from Maharashtra,

00:35:20.859 --> 00:35:35.784
but compared to the hard work I have done here and compared to the size of the state, there should have been a lot of progress here.

00:35:35.784 --> 00:35:44.808
They will tell me I have come specially, I said why did you come, who asked you to come?

00:35:44.808 --> 00:35:47.913
There was no need to come.

00:35:47.913 --> 00:35:55.703
And then when I come, instead of my ‘Darshan’, they will give their Darshan,

00:35:55.703 --> 00:36:02.223
and they will be fighting to be in the front, I have to look at their horrible faces,

00:36:02.223 --> 00:36:14.075
whatever you may think, need to understand that you people have a lot to learn.

00:36:14.075 --> 00:36:22.953
And I don’t understand where has all the pride gone,

00:36:22.953 --> 00:36:27.016
but there should be some humility, that we have to achieve this,

00:36:27.016 --> 00:36:34.198
we have to go higher, where have all those Saints and Sadhus have gone?

00:36:34.198 --> 00:36:44.936
I think all the Hardcore Brahmins have come over here, because,

00:36:44.936 --> 00:37:00.030
it is like this guru that guru, if you want to have an expanse of some wrong people then you can either do it in America or Maharashtra.

00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:07.915
They are so stupid that they do not know what is right and what is wrong.

00:37:07.915 --> 00:37:20.635
You should go and tell them, that if you do not even know the difference between right and wrong then what good are you for?

00:37:20.635 --> 00:37:30.363
Today I want to tell you that if you are real Sahaja Yogis, and then, ‘ we are Maharashtrian and related to Gyaneshwara and all that’

00:37:30.363 --> 00:37:38.680
wherever they go, they will say we are descendant of Gyaneshwara, with such pride, I said is that so?

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:44.192
And don’t even read the Marathi newspapers,

00:37:44.192 --> 00:37:48.770
they are all very complacent,

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:57.037
do not even know what to write and whatnot, what will be good for people,

00:37:57.037 --> 00:38:04.420
OK I understand that there have been some bad politicians, but are you all going to be like them?

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:18.911
Now I request you all not to argue amongst each other,

00:38:18.911 --> 00:38:29.840
and whoever has left Sahaja Yoga, you do not pay attention to them. They have nothing to do with us.

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:36.175
Somebody came to see me the other day, he had big-big bumps on his head,

00:38:36.175 --> 00:38:39.754
so I asked what was the matter? he said, “Mataji I am dying”, I said what happened,

00:38:39.754 --> 00:38:44.367
he told me he had gone to see such and such Sahaja Yogi, I said why?

00:38:44.367 --> 00:38:49.635
There are so many centres, you should go there.

00:38:49.635 --> 00:38:52.911
Now nobody should interfere with other centres,

00:38:52.911 --> 00:38:58.021
I want to see how everyone is managing their centres, I have decided that now. Nobody should interfere,

00:38:58.021 --> 00:39:05.282
people keep saying that, because of people keep interfering we have all the problems.

00:39:05.282 --> 00:39:10.752
Whoever is running the centre, that person is in charge and also the leader.

00:39:10.752 --> 00:39:17.011
And if anybody writes to me against the leader I will throw you out of Sahaja Yoga, that’s it.

00:39:17.011 --> 00:39:20.373
Christ has called them murmuring souls.

00:39:20.373 --> 00:39:23.828
It is all just nonsensical stuff,

00:39:23.828 --> 00:39:30.965
in old days Grandmas use to go on gossiping like that

00:39:30.965 --> 00:39:35.837
but the young people do the same thing then what to say about that?

00:39:35.837 --> 00:39:40.496
Talking against each other,

00:39:40.496 --> 00:39:45.139
or go on saying that why does such and such person do this or do that?

00:39:45.139 --> 00:39:50.556
How do you even have the desire to do such things?

00:39:50.556 --> 00:40:08.489
I want to take you to a much higher place, I want to give you that status of a Saint, I have given it to you, but you have to behave like a Saint!

00:40:08.489 --> 00:40:15.371
Yesterday I spoke about Warkaris (people who walk for miles bare feet, chanting gods name to visit some temples),

00:40:15.371 --> 00:40:20.054
but I did not speak.

00:40:20.054 --> 00:40:26.493
To put all their faith in completely the wrong things, is a speciality of Maharashtrians,Americans are also the same.

00:40:26.493 --> 00:40:36.230
I am talking about the Americans here because they have not got that maturity yet,

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:41.236
they don’t have that depth, but here live all the mature people,

00:40:41.236 --> 00:40:47.510
then what has happened to these mature people to behave in such a way?

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:56.051
Now at the time of the puja, I am telling you at the beginning,

00:40:56.051 --> 00:41:02.155
the ground you are sitting on, there The Saints have shed their blood,

00:41:02.155 --> 00:41:07.187
and it is not difficult for you to become Saints also,

00:41:07.187 --> 00:41:10.566
that is the reason you have taken your birth here.

00:41:10.566 --> 00:41:25.972
You have an experience, but even then if you boast about to say that we are ”Sahaja Yogis”, then what kind of Sahaja Yogis are you?

00:41:25.972 --> 00:41:34.050
This language (Marathi), there isn’t another language as spiritual as Marathi.

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:38.077
There has been so much spiritual work that has been done here,

00:41:38.077 --> 00:41:42.847
can’t praise this spiritual work enough, and you have taken birth here,

00:41:42.847 --> 00:41:44.585
is that without any good deeds (punyas) in past lives?

00:41:44.585 --> 00:41:52.649
But it has been a wasted, I did not take Samadhi at the age of 23 like Gyaneshwara,

00:41:52.649 --> 00:41:59.592
and even with having so much on their side, they are too clever for their good.

00:41:59.592 --> 00:42:03.638
Yesterday, there was somebody who came saying that I am working to demolish the blind faith in people,

00:42:03.638 --> 00:42:09.196
so there is that thing, whatever anybody comes up with people will start following him,

00:42:09.196 --> 00:42:14.276
they will follow in their thousands, to such filth.

00:42:14.276 --> 00:42:17.804
They have made so much money, Shri Mataji,

00:42:17.804 --> 00:42:20.740
and his wife has run off with Rajanish, ‘is that so’ I said,

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:24.252
maybe he did not give her any money.

00:42:24.252 --> 00:42:28.793
‘We used to worship him’, ‘really’? Then you carry on doing so.

00:42:28.793 --> 00:42:43.094
What do you mean by saying that ‘we used to worship him’, ‘who are you’? You should ask yourself ‘Who are you’, humility should start right from here, who am I?

00:42:43.094 --> 00:42:52.853
I am a Sahaja Yogi. ‘Who has become the Spirit (Aatma), I am a Sahaja Yogi,

00:42:52.853 --> 00:42:57.630
and how should a Sahaja Yogi behave?

00:42:57.630 --> 00:43:07.649
You have an example of Gyaneshwar in front of you, you have an example of Tukaram in front of you,

00:43:07.649 --> 00:43:15.144
Ramdas and Ekanatha’s example is in front of you,

00:43:15.144 --> 00:43:23.711
did you not hear what they had to say? have you not witnessed that?

00:43:23.711 --> 00:43:41.385
Namadeva, who Shri Gurunanaka embraced, wasn’t that Namadeva also a tailor from this Maharashtra?

00:43:41.385 --> 00:43:48.435
But what I see here, that they are busy singing in his temple!

00:43:48.435 --> 00:43:56.308
Even if there will be just ten tailors come to Sahaja Yoga then we should think that Namadevas existence has been worth it.

00:43:56.308 --> 00:44:09.516
Today I just want to pray to all those Saints that please take your birth here again in Maharashtra and put these people right.

00:44:09.516 --> 00:44:24.368
Sahaja Yoga has not progressed here as much as it should have, only Sahaja Yoga is growing (in numbers),

00:44:24.368 --> 00:44:31.938
as they say, that if something is weak and if you spread it too thin then it will get torn.

00:44:31.938 --> 00:44:37.898
I don’t hear all this over there (in a foreign country) that this is a different group and that is a different group,

00:44:37.898 --> 00:44:42.524
I do not see all this kind of quarrelling at all there.

00:44:42.524 --> 00:44:48.564
How can you have different groups in Sahaja Yoga?

00:44:48.564 --> 00:44:59.763
Shri Kartikeya himself took his birth here, they call Shri Saraswati, as ‘Skandhamata’.

00:44:59.763 --> 00:45:22.653
Actually, she was not his mother, she was a virgin, but she had embraced Shri Skandha as her son.

00:45:22.653 --> 00:45:32.623
That Kartikeya chose this Maharashtra to take his birth!

00:45:32.623 --> 00:45:49.440
The whole world is inspired by what Gyaneshwara has written down, but here it is the opposite.

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:54.905
They said that someone has come from America here, to build a University,

00:45:54.905 --> 00:46:05.704
‘Peace University’, here in Aalandi, so then what happened, they will not do any such thing here in Aalandi!

00:46:05.704 --> 00:46:09.652
Then they came and surrendered at my feet and said that Shri Mataji please now you do everything,

00:46:09.652 --> 00:46:18.280
we leave it to you now, we don’t want anything done by people in Maharashtra, we don’t want to deal with them.

00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:29.409
So, what happened was, there was some great person, who grabbed two and a half Crore rupees, from these poor Americans.

00:46:29.409 --> 00:46:33.463
Another person grabbed Three and half Crore.

00:46:33.463 --> 00:46:39.376
They ran away from there, they had enough of this Maharashtra.

00:46:39.376 --> 00:46:46.141
They said Shri Mataji wherever you will do it we will follow you there, please you do it, and give it your name.

00:46:46.141 --> 00:46:51.064
We had only met for two hours.

00:46:51.064 --> 00:47:00.936
They were shocked by the behaviour of these people, and it was not that these people who fooled them and took their money were politicians or anything.

00:47:00.936 --> 00:47:08.247
Absolutely everyone is running after money.

00:47:08.247 --> 00:47:21.164
The reason for telling you all this is because to achieve that depth, you have to look at yourself first (correct yourself),

00:47:21.164 --> 00:47:29.870
you have to pay attention to yourself, and see that, have I got any of those qualities that Shri Mataji is talking about?

00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:42.598
I tell everybody that when the Kundalini is awakened, all your problems and all your status drops away,

00:47:42.598 --> 00:47:47.947
you get detached from everything and you bloom like a lotus,

00:47:47.947 --> 00:47:53.545
but I don’t see that in Maharashtra,

00:47:53.545 --> 00:48:10.288
and again their biggest concern will be that what ‘status’ am I going to get?

00:48:10.288 --> 00:48:17.413
They will complain that who is this person to give us orders, who is he to correct me?

00:48:17.413 --> 00:48:23.482
We don’t believe in leaders, and then he will write to me against him.

00:48:23.482 --> 00:48:33.498
They will tell me about his character, telling me that, Shri Mataji, you threw me out of Sahaja Yoga because of such a person, but he has a very bad character.

00:48:33.498 --> 00:48:36.309
Do you think I do not have a brain of my own?

00:48:36.309 --> 00:48:44.674
If I had to do things using your brains then, I don’t know what would have happened!

00:48:44.674 --> 00:48:49.979
The biggest problem here is people are very ritualistic,

00:48:49.979 --> 00:48:55.685
like they will get up at 4 o’clock, have their bath, and sit in front of Shri Mataji for meditation,

00:48:55.685 --> 00:49:01.094
and then they will say that Shri Mataji, I do so much meditation and all that then why nothing goes right for me?

00:49:01.094 --> 00:49:06.181
I said look at your heart, you have not given me your heart?

00:49:06.181 --> 00:49:09.294
You have to give me your heart.

00:49:09.294 --> 00:49:14.001
Without having your heart, how should I fill it with anything?

00:49:14.001 --> 00:49:16.798
To fill it with love you have to have the ‘Heart’.

00:49:16.798 --> 00:49:21.295
I don’t think that the quarrelsome people have a heart.

00:49:21.295 --> 00:49:45.653
So the reason I have told you all these things in today’s puja that, you don’t have to be over smart,Marathi language is like a sword,

00:49:45.653 --> 00:49:56.216
I mean to say that you have to light a lamp in your heart (awakened the spirit) as soon as the light in your heart, you will find out everything about yourself.

00:49:56.216 --> 00:50:02.413
When we were young, our Mother used to say, where is your attention?

00:50:02.413 --> 00:50:11.653
Now I understand its meaning. ‘Where is your attention? What is your aim?’

00:50:11.653 --> 00:50:16.823
‘To become a Saint!’

00:50:16.823 --> 00:50:31.527
All the anger, irritable behaviour, bringing in something new, all this kind of thing, will not be allowed in Sahaja Yoga.

00:50:31.527 --> 00:50:46.572
You should be peaceful by nature, take the example of Amrutanubhava, how amazing it is.

00:50:46.572 --> 00:50:51.653
How Gyaneshwara has explained it to people,

00:50:51.653 --> 00:50:59.876
but where are those people now, who would understand it? They do not understand what he has written.

00:50:59.876 --> 00:51:08.024
So take to Amrutanubhava don’t go on reading scriptures in a ritualistic way.

00:51:08.024 --> 00:51:14.968
Read every word from it (Amrutanubhava) to see if you are anywhere at that level.

00:51:14.968 --> 00:51:27.013
A Sahaja Yogi who is completely satisfied, and joyful, become one with himself,

00:51:27.013 --> 00:51:33.658
he does not want any power or money, he has reached that level.

00:51:33.658 --> 00:51:44.123
He becomes the joy himself, he has a very special kind of personality.

00:51:44.123 --> 00:51:49.914
But here in Maharashtra there are some very great people in Sahaja Yoga,

00:51:49.914 --> 00:51:57.470
like especially chiselled diamonds, great very great (a bit unclear),

00:51:57.470 --> 00:52:01.490
but the rest of them are just ordinary.

00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:11.816
There should be no rivalry amongst each other,

00:52:11.816 --> 00:52:20.991
nobody should write to me criticizing others,I do not like that at all.

00:52:20.991 --> 00:52:25.810
I do not like that at all. Not only me but nobody likes it,

00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:30.279
and there will be consequences of it, so please do not write to me such dirty letters.

00:52:30.279 --> 00:52:33.966
In your opinion, it might be very good, but just keep it to yourself.

00:52:33.966 --> 00:52:38.440
You don’t need to tell me anything I know everything.

00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:41.786
But you all have to know everything,

00:52:41.786 --> 00:52:46.945
out of you people will come jewel, I know that because this is a mine,

00:52:46.945 --> 00:52:53.438
and if you could only see the cole in the mine, there are some real jewel.

00:52:53.438 --> 00:52:59.259
I have worked hard here for so many years,

00:52:59.259 --> 00:53:02.163
if but you have not recognize yourself then what can I do?

00:53:02.163 --> 00:53:14.913
The life of Gyaneshwara was so very important, just 23 years of life, but very important. How must have he lived his life?

00:53:14.913 --> 00:53:19.627
He took his birth in a sanyasi (Ascetic) family, he did that on purpose,

00:53:19.627 --> 00:53:27.730
because he wanted to show people that, all this is just artificial,

00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:37.813
he took his birth against all odds, to expose all pretentious and artificial nature.

00:53:37.813 --> 00:53:42.227
And he was tortured by all these pretentious people.

00:53:42.227 --> 00:53:46.514
Don’t let that happen in Sahaja Yoga.

00:53:46.514 --> 00:54:00.070
Just try and remember one thing about Mataji that I know everything about everybody.

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:05.623
I do not need to be told anything.

00:54:05.623 --> 00:54:17.127
The only thing is that you have to recognize yourself.

00:54:17.127 --> 00:54:30.529
Instead of recognizing me, if you recognize yourself, then we should think that today’s Puja has been worthwhile (meaningful), but I doubt it.

00:54:30.529 --> 00:54:38.599
In North India, the work has started in a very big way,

00:54:38.599 --> 00:54:50.402
I don’t have a doubt about that, and there, the IAS officers has made an association amongst themselves,

00:54:50.402 --> 00:55:20.766
and if they find some people who are corrupt, whoever it may be, on any higher position, they will take an action against him.

00:55:20.766 --> 00:55:33.328
They will find out everything about his background, where has he come from, how he is making his money, everything, and then they will take him to court.

00:55:33.328 --> 00:55:39.774
I was asking these IAS people that, how did you come to Sahaja Yoga?

00:55:39.774 --> 00:55:46.993
They said, Shri Mataji, it is such a big problem (corruption), we are very honest people, we don’t know how to be dishonest at all.

00:55:46.993 --> 00:56:01.508
We are also the same, my Husband is also the same, also my Son-in-law is the same, we can not be dishonest.

00:56:01.508 --> 00:56:06.532
So they thought now what to do, how to live with these corrupt people? They tell us to be dishonest,

00:56:06.532 --> 00:56:18.547
but then we found the way, when we came to Sahaja, all of us like-minded, honest people formed a unity.

00:56:18.547 --> 00:56:22.444
Nobody fights with each other, nothing of the kind.

00:56:22.444 --> 00:56:28.205
And just like that, you all should also unite as Sahaja Yogis.

00:56:28.205 --> 00:56:52.929
Because we are standing on truth, and no one could make move away from the truth, and the light of that truth is love.

00:56:52.929 --> 00:57:02.933
Gyaneshwara has clearly said that, where there is love amongst each other, only those people will be your true relatives.

00:57:02.933 --> 00:57:06.235
But no, they will say we have Haldi-Kunku (a ritual at Sankranti time, where women go round each others houses to put Haldi-kumkum on each others forehead) program at our house, so I asked who will be coming?

00:57:06.235 --> 00:57:18.262
They will tell me my aunt who believes in such and such god or another aunt who worships such and such guru are coming, are there any Sahaja yogis coming?

00:57:18.262 --> 00:57:26.105
Who are your relatives? These are your relatives (Sahaja yogis).

00:57:26.105 --> 00:57:34.570
These are your brothers and sisters, instead of talking against them, or go on fighting with them, fight with yourself.

00:57:34.570 --> 00:57:47.400
Today in the whole world, people have come together (united) through Sahaja Yoga,

00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:55.087
the thing I call collectivity is in real sense has been established all over.

00:57:55.087 --> 00:57:58.135
I could hear it echoing through all 65 countries.

00:57:58.135 --> 00:58:00.627
But I can not see anything like that in Maharashtra.

00:58:00.627 --> 00:58:11.475
You have to truly come together, whatever happens, we are Sahaja Yogis,

00:58:11.475 --> 00:58:20.936
and all others are strangers for us, until and unless you realize this, you will not go deeper in Sahaja Yoga, because you are not collective.

00:58:20.936 --> 00:58:26.602
It is not going to happen unless you become a collective being.

00:58:26.602 --> 00:58:37.672
Now if you look at the sea, if there is a wave, it goes around the whole of the sea,

00:58:37.672 --> 00:58:43.202
because the sea itself is collective, all the drops stays together,

00:58:43.202 --> 00:58:48.735
if one drop goes outside, then it will evaporate with the heat of the Sun.

00:58:48.735 --> 00:58:55.763
It is exactly like that in Sahaja Yoga, if you are in then you are properly in, otherwise you are not.

00:58:55.763 --> 00:59:06.341
Talking against each other, talking ill about each other, does not suit you,

00:59:06.341 --> 00:59:11.135
today on the Puja day you have to cleanse your heart.

00:59:11.135 --> 00:59:22.144
And let the Ganges of love flow in such heart.

00:59:22.144 --> 00:59:30.663
Maharashtrian needs to get rid of their snobbishness.

00:59:30.663 --> 00:59:38.552
‘I need to see Shri Mataji’, ‘Send a message to Shri Mataji’, no there is no need for that,

00:59:38.552 --> 00:59:44.498
if you have to see me, then you can see me in your heart.

00:59:44.498 --> 00:59:48.113
Only there (in the Heart) I will meet you.

00:59:48.113 --> 00:59:50.188
All this is just too much.

00:59:50.188 --> 01:00:01.077
when they come to Pratishthan, I get bombarded with everybody wanting to see me,

01:00:01.077 --> 01:00:04.854
they feel as if they are ‘somebody special’, therefore they have to meet Shri Mataji. ‘I am a doctor’, OK you might be a doctor,

01:00:04.854 --> 01:00:10.841
go and sit in your dispensary, ‘I am a Barrister’ ‘I am this, I am that’,

01:00:10.841 --> 01:00:14.012
‘I am a peon of a Chief Minister’.

01:00:14.012 --> 01:00:23.647
The variety of egos you can see in Maharashtra, you won’t be able to see anywhere else.

01:00:23.647 --> 01:00:26.391
It should not stick on to you (ego).

01:00:26.391 --> 01:00:36.013
The very reason you are called Maharashtrian, the very reason you are Maharashtrian,

01:00:36.013 --> 01:00:46.355
you are great people for being born in this Maharashtra, then why are you stuck in this mud?

01:00:46.355 --> 01:00:57.268
Wanting to be in the front all the time, showing off.

01:00:57.268 --> 01:01:07.836
These people who have come here (from abroad), you would not be able to tell who is the leader out of them!

01:01:07.836 --> 01:01:11.528
It is just not in them (showing off),

01:01:11.528 --> 01:01:16.920
because they know what humility is in Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:25.001
In today’s Puja, I am giving you infinite blessings

01:01:25.001 --> 01:01:40.298
that you experience the oneness with your spirit, don’t be half-hearted (half baked), become complete.

01:01:40.298 --> 01:01:44.319
I am giving you this infinite blessing.

01:01:44.319 --> 01:02:07.693
I am sorry, I had to speak in Marathi language because I had to tell them something which I don’t want you to know (Laughter).

01:02:07.693 --> 01:02:18.644
Today is a great day, I should say in a way,

01:02:18.644 --> 01:02:25.612
because I am going to tell you one thing great.

01:02:25.612 --> 01:02:33.127
That is Shri Gyaneshwara – in Marathi they call it ‘Dnyaneshwara’ –

01:02:33.127 --> 01:02:41.212
He was the incarnation of Kartikeya.

01:02:41.212 --> 01:02:56.452
And Saraswati, who was a virgin, she looked after Him like Her own son.

01:02:56.452 --> 01:03:04.849
He was the brother of Shri Ganapati but She looked after Him.

01:03:04.849 --> 01:03:11.448
And then also there’s description how He was born and all those (things), is very interesting.

01:03:11.448 --> 01:03:22.746
But here in this place, in this Maharashtra, He took His incarnation.

01:03:22.746 --> 01:03:36.573
And also there were many great, great, very great saints in so many numbers took place, took their birth in this Maharashtra.

01:03:36.573 --> 01:03:46.133
But such horrible people, they tortured their lives.

01:03:46.133 --> 01:03:53.031
Worse than Christian Inquisition I tell you; worse than any inquisition anywhere.

01:03:53.031 --> 01:03:56.975
Individually they attacked.

01:03:56.975 --> 01:04:08.721
And that same people are born again in this great country of Maharashtra.

01:04:08.721 --> 01:04:17.134
They are very talented people; they write very well. Their language is so rich.

01:04:17.134 --> 01:04:37.672
You can see that, what description of a realized soul, given by Gyaneshwara, is so beautiful.

01:04:37.672 --> 01:04:51.153
He says that, “The moon doesn’t run after moonlight, the sun doesn’t run after sunlight.

01:04:51.153 --> 01:04:58.768
In that way a realized soul doesn’t bother about his own glory.

01:04:58.768 --> 01:05:09.881
The sun shines till it shines, then it takes back all his rays.

01:05:09.881 --> 01:05:15.662
Whatever work the rays have to do they do it. And the sun is just watching,

01:05:15.662 --> 01:05:20.836
watching all the work, then he takes them back.

01:05:20.836 --> 01:05:29.025
And he gets completely contained within himself”.

01:05:29.025 --> 01:05:34.796
Samavun ghene, completely contained within himself.

01:05:34.796 --> 01:05:46.931
The description He has given of realized souls is so beautiful, if you could just experience it.

01:05:46.931 --> 01:06:04.021
Namadeva, who was born much later, said that even one line of Gyanesha [MEANS Saint Gyaneshwara, fondly called by a short name] if you could experience, you had that.

01:06:04.021 --> 01:06:08.672
I wish you all could read Amrutanubhava in English,

01:06:08.672 --> 01:06:13.160
understanding how He describes a realized soul,

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:18.660
and you’ll find that within yourself it has happened.

01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:21.688
You are different from others very much.

01:06:21.688 --> 01:06:31.789
You’ll be amazed how you have got such beautiful description of your Self.

01:06:31.789 --> 01:06:39.065
I was talking about Maharashtrians; they are extremely talented people.

01:06:39.065 --> 01:06:46.053
See their music. In music no-one can beat them.

01:06:46.053 --> 01:06:50.547
See their drama. In drama no-one can beat them.

01:06:50.547 --> 01:06:59.471
You can see from films. In Maharashtra only great films were created.

01:06:59.471 --> 01:07:12.093
The another one is Bengal, which is, I would say, different but of the same level.

01:07:12.093 --> 01:07:22.799
It’s such a talented people here, it shows that God has a special blessing for these two,

01:07:22.799 --> 01:07:29.566
and, should be, Maharashtrians should rise very high.

01:07:29.566 --> 01:07:37.827
But all the time complaining about others, talking ill of others, and something very low they do.

01:07:37.827 --> 01:07:43.884
I’m surprised it, I hope you don’t pick up anything from them.

01:07:43.884 --> 01:07:56.549
And also the fussiness that is of the North Indians; that’s also not a very good thing.

01:07:56.549 --> 01:08:06.713
It’s surprising how you people have adjusted yourself to this country, which has all kinds of parasites.

01:08:06.713 --> 01:08:14.364
Because you live with vibrations, you feel the vibrations.

01:08:14.364 --> 01:08:20.288
It’s something so great to see you all here,

01:08:20.288 --> 01:08:26.982
and I’m telling them that they should try to understand you people.

01:08:26.982 --> 01:08:33.759
Really I’m very proud of you all who have come all the way here.

01:08:33.759 --> 01:08:49.057
In this puja I am thinking of so many great saints who were born, who were great gurus, mahagurus.

01:08:49.057 --> 01:09:00.828
Of course Gyanesha, I must say, is the king of all those high, highly evolved souls, no doubt.

01:09:00.828 --> 01:09:15.177
So we are now having a puja on the twenty-fourth of December because it’s a Datta Jayanti, Dattatreya’s birth.

01:09:15.177 --> 01:09:18.951
And so we’ll be having on the twenty-fourth night.

01:09:18.951 --> 01:09:22.343
In any case it’s a Christmas Eve.

01:09:22.343 --> 01:09:30.886
We could all start with that. And also Dattatreya, who took His form in Maharashtra.

01:09:30.886 --> 01:09:39.012
Maharashtrians understand Dattatreya. They understand the Nath Panthis.

01:09:39.012 --> 01:09:49.507
These Nathas went all over. They went to Kiev. You’ll be amazed, they went even up to Bolivia,

01:09:49.507 --> 01:09:58.352
those who are from Maharashtra, from Rahuri. Can you imagine?

01:09:58.352 --> 01:10:09.336
Such great people they were, and that is what I expect to happen in this Maharashtra.

01:10:09.336 --> 01:10:17.563
And I’m sure one day I’ll be very much happy with all of them; not few.

01:10:17.563 --> 01:10:21.093
There are some very great Maharashtrians, no doubt,

01:10:21.093 --> 01:10:30.947
but all of them have to join together because I talk of synthesis, not of divisive method.

01:10:30.947 --> 01:10:37.804
I hope they understand the inner feeling that I have,

01:10:37.804 --> 01:10:46.267
otherwise all the good diamonds will be selected

01:10:46.267 --> 01:10:56.293
and the ones which are defective will be thrown away. What’s the use?

01:10:56.293 --> 01:11:04.421
But all of them are capable of achieving any height. They may belong to any caste, community, doesn’t matter;

01:11:04.421 --> 01:11:11.147
but they are born in Maharashtra, which is such a great country.

01:11:11.147 --> 01:11:18.942
So today they wanted to do Mahalakshmi, this thing, we already have Mahalakshmi temple.

01:11:18.942 --> 01:11:23.114
And they have a great blessing of Mahalakshmi also, in a way,

01:11:23.114 --> 01:11:35.026
but they lack: one is the wisdom, and the second the spirit of Kartikeya.

01:11:35.026 --> 01:11:50.628
The spirit of Kartikeya – that pure,

01:11:50.628 --> 01:12:06.453
absolute dynamism which doesn’t indulge into nonsensical things and useless things; which shows the results.

01:12:06.453 --> 01:12:12.720
May God bless you all!
