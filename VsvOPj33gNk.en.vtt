00:16:16.952 --> 00:16:28.952
Today you all have expressed the desire to do a puja to Shri Mahalakshmi,

00:16:28.952 --> 00:16:34.784
but here in Maharashtra, Shri Mahalakshmi is worshipped regularly

00:16:34.784 --> 00:16:45.494
and she has appeared here in Maharashtra.

00:16:45.494 --> 00:17:21.249
But I had an immense desire to tell you all about Shri Kartikeya

00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:35.844
because he took birth in this Maharashtra, he was Shri Gyaneshwara himself.

00:17:35.844 --> 00:17:44.650
I have not said anything about this until now because Maharashtrians find it difficult to understand it.

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:52.624
Shri Kartikeya himself took birth in this Maharashtra

00:17:52.624 --> 00:18:14.276
and he wrote such great and deep scriptures like Gyaneshwari and Amrutanubhava.

00:18:14.276 --> 00:18:31.290
You can check on vibrations by asking if Shri Gyaneshwara was an incarnation of Shri Kartikeya

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:46.193
and you will find yourself in an ocean of beautiful, joyful cool breeze.

00:18:46.193 --> 00:19:00.288
I never told such a big thing like this in Maharashtra, because of the change in the attitude of Maharashtrian people now.

00:19:00.288 --> 00:19:05.620
Maybe because of all the horrible politicians we had here,

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:22.072
and it might have influenced the Maharashtrians. And Shri Kartikeya being from here, to presume that `we ourselves are Kartikeyas´ is just a Maharashtrian mentality,

00:19:22.072 --> 00:19:27.838
[thinking]we are someone great.

00:19:27.838 --> 00:19:35.560
It is very true what these people were telling  just now, that there were 40 IAS officers had come

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:47.150
and I saw on the way, there were three policemen on horseback, so I asked: who had come?, they told me that the chief secretary himself had come.

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:56.742
The Governor himself of that place welcomed me &amp; said, Shri Mataji, if I don’t welcome you properly with respect, then these people would throw me out.

00:19:56.742 --> 00:20:02.391
This is the level of understanding in those people,

00:20:02.391 --> 00:20:16.031
and there Shri Gyaneshwara did not take his birth (Lakhnau, North India). Now I understand why he wanted to take his birth in Maharashtra.

00:20:16.031 --> 00:20:23.805
By the age of only 23, he had enough of Maharashtra and decided to take Samadhi.

00:20:23.805 --> 00:20:35.239
The way the Saints were tortured in this Maharashtra, nowhere else they were treated like that.

00:20:35.239 --> 00:20:39.292
They feel that they have done something great,

00:20:39.292 --> 00:20:46.567
but after the Saints have died then they will build temples for them, and sing songs in their name.

00:20:46.567 --> 00:20:51.392
All this is just a nonsensical business to pass the time.

00:20:51.392 --> 00:20:57.999
All these years, this Maharashtra is my Motherland, [Marathi] my mother tongue.

00:20:57.999 --> 00:21:07.652
Shivaji Maharaj has said to awaken the Dharma of oneself

00:21:07.652 --> 00:21:18.683
and then Gyaneshwara himself has already said that the world should see the sunrise of the Dharma of oneself.

00:21:18.683 --> 00:21:27.537
So the words which Shivaji Maharaj said, same work I am carrying forward.

00:21:27.537 --> 00:21:42.766
So that the universal religion of oneself should be awakened, and it should take place in this Maharashtra first,

00:21:42.766 --> 00:21:46.960
because Gyaneshwara has told that to people in Maharashtra first of all.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:54.288
Whatever I said about Maharashtra yesterday,  do not feel bad about it,

00:21:54.288 --> 00:22:03.262
and don´t go on thinking that Shri Mataji was talking about this person or that person.

00:22:03.262 --> 00:22:11.383
You need to think about yourself, that means ‘Introspection’.

00:22:11.383 --> 00:22:17.332
What great work have we done to feel so great about?

00:22:17.332 --> 00:22:28.552
Thinking that we had Saint Namadeva and so many great Saints here, and saying, ‘Shri Mataji herself has said it’. But you are not the Saints.

00:22:28.552 --> 00:22:35.950
It will be like, there is a beautiful Lotus in a pond

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:43.451
and a frog living inside it thinking that ‘he is somebody so great because he lives with such a beautiful lotus’.

00:22:43.451 --> 00:22:48.688
Exactly that kind of thinking is quite a lot in Maharashtra, you should all take a note of that.

00:22:48.688 --> 00:22:54.977
The kind of behaviour I have seen here (in Maharashtra) never seen it anywhere else in the world.

00:22:54.977 --> 00:22:59.229
The first thing is the tendency of quarrelling,

00:22:59.229 --> 00:23:05.943
I get so fed up sometimes, that I said now I will allow only one puja, and no more.

00:23:05.943 --> 00:23:15.321
We have built this beautiful Ashram here in Ganapatipule,

00:23:15.321 --> 00:23:25.247
so they have got a problem with that, such filthy people, they do not understand anything.

00:23:25.247 --> 00:23:32.181
They think ‘they live in the land of Saints’, and also have ‘Ashtavinaykas’,

00:23:32.181 --> 00:23:36.979
also have ‘The three and half Swayambhus of The Goddess’.

00:23:36.979 --> 00:23:47.011
All these people(saints) must have dared to appear here to cleanse this place, and I also have dared to work here.

00:23:47.011 --> 00:23:52.200
I am so surprised to see what these people been up to.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:24:01.756
One gentleman who I´ve never even seen his face, without my permission arranged a procession,

00:24:01.756 --> 00:24:07.317
someone else has puja done to himself under my name,

00:24:07.317 --> 00:24:18.973
I never seen such kind of nonsense anywhere else, not even in Madras, or in Bengal.

00:24:18.973 --> 00:24:23.690
There is no fear of God, they will go on doing whatever they feel like.

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:29.350
There were some bad people, who were not behaving according to Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:35.963
I told them that they should not stay in Sahaja Yoga, for now. First they should put themselves right.

00:24:35.963 --> 00:24:44.003
So they did not like that, they said, ‘Shri Mataji talks about love and then why does she get angry with us?’.

00:24:44.003 --> 00:24:51.002
I am a Mother and I have to tell whatever is good for you,

00:24:51.002 --> 00:24:58.560
and I do. At some places, I do not have to tell anything, there is no need for it.

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:08.636
Some ‘great’(snobbish) people, who always have to be in the front,

00:25:08.636 --> 00:25:15.246
they will make a point of showing that they have specially come from Thane with one flower in their hand,

00:25:15.246 --> 00:25:20.804
and I am going to give it to Mataji myself,

00:25:20.804 --> 00:25:27.290
they look like they have just come from a mental asylum,

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:37.023
so why it is like this in Maharashtra, I do not understand.

00:25:37.023 --> 00:25:41.916
The land is so pure here because there have been so many Saints,

00:25:41.916 --> 00:25:46.012
and even more so because of Ashtavinayakas

00:25:46.012 --> 00:25:51.267
and on top of all that, there are three and a half Swayambhus of The Goddess.

00:25:51.267 --> 00:25:57.015
It is such a pure land, so why then do such horrible things happen here?

00:25:57.015 --> 00:25:59.929
There was one gentleman who was possessed,

00:25:59.929 --> 00:26:07.345
so I told him to keep away from Sahaja Yoga,

00:26:07.345 --> 00:26:12.308
so he started his Sahaja Yoga of his own.

00:26:12.308 --> 00:26:27.096
He did not want to see that there is something wrong with him, but goes on thinking that he is somebody very great, thinking that, ‘now I will show them’.

00:26:27.096 --> 00:26:33.616
To that extent that his wife went on telling everyone that ‘my husband is greater than Mataji’.

00:26:33.616 --> 00:26:42.626
God knows if greater or lower! I was really surprised to know all these strange things.

00:26:42.626 --> 00:26:47.738
Such a thing never happened anywhere else.

00:26:47.738 --> 00:26:56.741
Moreover our Marathi Newspapers! Hindi and English newspapers are much better than that.

00:26:56.741 --> 00:27:04.061
They(Marathi Newspaers) go on writing whatever they like.

00:27:04.061 --> 00:27:09.204
Quarreling amongst each other is the nature of the Maharashtrians.

00:27:09.204 --> 00:27:20.926
OK whatever it was, but now you are in Sahaja Yoga!

00:27:20.926 --> 00:27:29.602
Still, there is so much jealously, fighting, pulling each other down, snobbish behaviour, and they will say that ‘we are old Sahaja yogis’,

00:27:29.602 --> 00:27:34.595
and these are new in Sahaja Yoga, so they don’t know anything.

00:27:34.595 --> 00:27:42.102
Slowly the people from North India have started to come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:27:42.102 --> 00:27:46.293
but after seeing the situation here (Maharashtra) they started to go away.

00:27:46.293 --> 00:27:53.628
When I went to Pune, there were some people from Punjab, who had come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:27:53.628 --> 00:28:01.147
they said, Shri Mataji what are you doing with these sarcastic Maharashtrian people, they just want to create problems for everyone.

00:28:01.147 --> 00:28:05.587
I felt very bad to hear that, I thought how can these people say this?

00:28:05.587 --> 00:28:11.952
How do they dare say that? I said to them (Punjabis) what do you think of yourself?

00:28:11.952 --> 00:28:18.319
But I know today they are about 8 to 10 very good strong Sahaja yogis.

00:28:18.319 --> 00:28:27.567
They have built an Ashram in Delhi and you will be surprised to know that every day, for meditation, before going to work,

00:28:27.567 --> 00:28:39.752
from ten miles away they will come by car or by bus.There are at least 100 people who come for meditation.

00:28:39.752 --> 00:28:59.912
Rest is very nice. We are very blessed here, blessed by The Goddess!

00:28:59.912 --> 00:29:09.432
 We are very clever in doing the work perfectly well outwardly,

00:29:09.432 --> 00:29:13.480
but when are we going to get awakened from inside?

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:19.239
Without getting awakened from within, you are not going to understand yourself.

00:29:19.239 --> 00:29:29.659
You are not going to be able to know the intensity of me without getting to know yourself first.

00:29:29.659 --> 00:29:34.376
Just now what he told you, that I myself had asked him to tell you,

00:29:34.376 --> 00:29:37.562
because I could not get myself to say these things.

00:29:37.562 --> 00:29:41.674
Now, these people (foreigners) who have gone much deeper in Sahaja Yoga,

00:29:41.674 --> 00:29:44.669
who used to take drugs, take alcohol and all kinds of things,

00:29:44.669 --> 00:29:51.468
have acheived such great heights, and the Maharashtrians just busy fighting among each other, so what to say?

00:29:51.468 --> 00:29:58.733
They say that Mataji gets angry with us. So what should I suppose to do? If not get angry, should I suppose to garland you?

00:29:58.733 --> 00:30:04.873
Not just experts in quarrelling but they are also experts in gossiping.

00:30:04.873 --> 00:30:18.429
Just to pass the time they will go on gossiping.

00:30:18.429 --> 00:30:34.154
Then if nothing else, they will start saying that Mataji does not give any money for anything these days, so we have to pay extra money.

00:30:34.154 --> 00:30:42.335
I have myself been paying for everything, right from your food, accommodation, I have tried to pay for everything,

00:30:42.335 --> 00:30:47.723
and still you people go on saying such things.

00:30:47.723 --> 00:30:52.440
Do you think I am like politicians or what?

00:30:52.440 --> 00:31:05.081
And then they will ask me: Mataji why do we have so many earthquakes and other disasters?

00:31:05.081 --> 00:31:15.921
I have never seen so many drunkards anywhere else as much I have seen in Maharashtra,

00:31:15.921 --> 00:31:27.276
you will not find it in Delhi (drunks) not even one, not even in a foreign country,

00:31:27.276 --> 00:31:35.790
but in this Maharashtra where ever you go you will find drunks.

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:42.694
It is like this from the beginning, since many years. When I went to Rahuri once,

00:31:42.694 --> 00:31:52.474
there was a big road going up, and when we stopped the car there and what I could see, they were dropping like dead flies,

00:31:52.474 --> 00:31:56.258
I thought what is going on here, is there some disease like cholera or something?

00:31:56.258 --> 00:32:08.068
Wearing a white hat, white Kurta, and dropping dead like flies!

00:32:08.068 --> 00:32:20.988
I said what is going on here? So they told me that there is a place called Indira Nagari where you can buy very cheap alcohol.

00:32:20.988 --> 00:32:27.161
Big number of people here drink alcohol.

00:32:27.161 --> 00:32:34.595
If you go to Delhi, you won´t find so many people, even officers, drinking alcohol,

00:32:34.595 --> 00:32:37.950
some people even avoid going to places where people are drinking alcohol.

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:47.867
But here everybody drinks, where ever you go, to any party, anywhere if they don´t get drunk then they won’t be Maharashtrians!

00:32:47.867 --> 00:32:56.512
You know, we did not even know what alcohol was when we were growing up, did not know even what colour it was supposed to be.

00:32:56.512 --> 00:33:02.491
So, if you say something anybody about their drinking, they will say,

00:33:02.491 --> 00:33:08.790
look such and such person was 70 yrs old and he used to drink alcohol, so I said is that so, then go and put up his statue.

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:12.133
This is the situation here now.

00:33:12.133 --> 00:33:21.647
When we were very young at the age of seven we took on a fight to close the shops where they sold alcohol.

00:33:21.647 --> 00:33:33.177
Here leave alone alcohol shops, some such people can’t live without alcohol.

00:33:33.177 --> 00:33:44.266
If I say a word against alcohol, then people will be after my life, you can not say a word against it.

00:33:44.266 --> 00:33:57.631
These are all the journalists, and all people in business, it is really surprising.

00:33:57.631 --> 00:34:01.993
In a place like Lukhnau, where there was a person like Wajid Ali Shah,

00:34:01.993 --> 00:34:13.872
he was a Nawab, there they have such softness in their nature, their language is full of humility, their nature is so humble.

00:34:13.872 --> 00:34:21.393
I was so surprised, they will talk ill about this person or that person, (talking about Maharashtrians),

00:34:21.393 --> 00:34:29.819
they will send me letters after letters, and such horrible letters, about someone’s character and this and that, I am so fed up of it.

00:34:29.819 --> 00:34:33.807
If a letter has come from Maharashtra then I just tell them to burn it.

00:34:33.807 --> 00:34:39.288
Now what to say in front of Saint Gyanadeva here,

00:34:39.288 --> 00:34:45.259
at the age of just 23 years he took Samadhi.

00:34:45.259 --> 00:34:51.442
They say that Gyaneshwara never criticized anyone.

00:34:51.442 --> 00:35:02.831
Why would anyone do that? There was no point in wasting time doing it, that is why he did not criticize anyone.

00:35:02.831 --> 00:35:09.775
But he talked about the situation there, he talked about people in that situation, but who is going to understand that,

00:35:09.775 --> 00:35:13.531
it is not something these Maharashtrians will understand.

00:35:13.531 --> 00:35:20.318
I won´t say that I didn´t get any people [sahajyogi] in Maharashtra,

00:35:20.318 --> 00:35:35.243
but compared to the hard work I have done here and compared to the size of the state, there should have been a lot of progress here.

00:35:35.243 --> 00:35:44.267
They will tell me, I have come specially, I said why did you come, who asked you to come?

00:35:44.267 --> 00:35:47.372
There was no need to come.

00:35:47.372 --> 00:35:55.162
And then when I come, instead of my ‘Darshan’ (appearance), they want to give their darshan only,

00:35:55.162 --> 00:36:01.682
and then they will be fighting to be in the front, and I must look at their horrible faces.

00:36:01.682 --> 00:36:13.534
Whatever you may think, you need to understand that you people have a lot to learn.

00:36:13.534 --> 00:36:22.412
And I don’t understand where all the pride(leave apart of Tanaji) has gone,

00:36:22.412 --> 00:36:26.475
but there should be some humility, that we have to achieve this,

00:36:26.475 --> 00:36:33.657
we have to go higher. Where have all those Saints and Sadhus gone?

00:36:33.657 --> 00:36:44.395
I think all the Hardcore Brahmins have come over here, because

00:36:44.395 --> 00:36:59.489
it is like this guru that guru, if you want to make wrong people popular then you can either do it in America or Maharashtra.

00:36:59.489 --> 00:37:07.374
They are so stupid that they do not know what is right and what is wrong.

00:37:07.374 --> 00:37:20.094
You should go and tell them, that if you do not even know the difference between right and wrong then what good are you for?

00:37:20.094 --> 00:37:29.822
Today I want to tell you that if you are real Sahaja Yogis, then[leave this false pride], ‘ we are Maharashtrians and related to Gyaneshwara’,

00:37:29.822 --> 00:37:38.139
wherever they go, they will say: we are descendant of Gyaneshwara, with such pride, I said: is that so? Ican see it.

00:37:38.139 --> 00:37:43.651
And don’t even read the Marathi newspapers,

00:37:43.651 --> 00:37:48.229
they are all very like unwanted mushrooms sprouted,

00:37:48.229 --> 00:37:56.496
do not even know what to write and what not, what will be good for people.

00:37:56.496 --> 00:38:03.879
OK I understand that there have been some bad politicians, but are you all going to be like them?

00:38:03.879 --> 00:38:18.370
Now I request you all not to argue amongst each other

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:29.299
and whoever have left Sahaja Yoga, do not pay attention to them. They have nothing to do with us.

00:38:29.299 --> 00:38:35.634
The other day somebody came to see me, he had big-big bumps on his head.

00:38:35.634 --> 00:38:39.213
So I asked what was the matter? He said, “Mataji I am dying”, I asked what happened?.

00:38:39.213 --> 00:38:43.826
He told me he had gone to see such and such sahaja yogi, I said why?

00:38:43.826 --> 00:38:49.094
There are so many centres, you should go there.

00:38:49.094 --> 00:38:52.370
Now nobody should interfere with other centres.

00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:57.480
I want to see how everyone is managing their centre. I have decided now that nobody should interfer,

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:04.741
because people keep saying that, as people keep interfering we have all the problems.

00:39:04.741 --> 00:39:10.211
Whoever is running the centre, that person is in charge and also the leader.

00:39:10.211 --> 00:39:16.470
And if you write to me against the leader I will throw you out of Sahaja Yoga, that’s it.

00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:19.832
Christ has called them murmuring souls.

00:39:19.832 --> 00:39:23.287
It is all just nonsensical stuff,

00:39:23.287 --> 00:39:30.424
in old days Grandmas used to go on gossiping like that

00:39:30.424 --> 00:39:35.296
but the young people do the same thing then what to say about that?

00:39:35.296 --> 00:39:39.955
Talking against each other,

00:39:39.955 --> 00:39:44.598
or go on saying that why does such and such person do this or do that?

00:39:44.598 --> 00:39:50.015
How do you even have the desire to do such things?

00:39:50.015 --> 00:40:07.948
I want to take you to a much higher place, to give you that status of a Saint, I have already given it to you, but you have to behave like a Saint!

00:40:07.948 --> 00:40:14.830
Yesterday I spoke about Warkaris (people who walk for miles bare feet, chanting gods name to visit some temples),

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:19.513
since a long I wanted to tell you but I did not speak.

00:40:19.513 --> 00:40:25.952
To have all their faith in completely wrong things, is a speciality of Maharashtrians,Americans are also the same.

00:40:25.952 --> 00:40:35.689
I am talking about the Americans here because they have not got that maturity yet,

00:40:35.689 --> 00:40:40.695
they don’t have that depth, but here live all the mature people,

00:40:40.695 --> 00:40:46.969
then what has happened to these mature people to behave in such a way?

00:40:46.969 --> 00:40:55.510
Now at the time of the puja, I am telling you at the beginning,

00:40:55.510 --> 00:41:01.614
the ground you are sitting on, The Saints have shed their blood there ,

00:41:01.614 --> 00:41:06.646
and it is not difficult for you also to become Saints.

00:41:06.646 --> 00:41:10.025
That is the reason you have taken your birth here.

00:41:10.025 --> 00:41:25.431
You have an experience, but even then if you boast about yourself, "we are Sahaja Yogis”, then what kind of Sahaja Yogis are you?

00:41:25.431 --> 00:41:33.509
This language (Marathi), there isn’t another language as spiritual as Marathi.

00:41:33.509 --> 00:41:37.536
There has been so much spiritual work that has been done here,

00:41:37.536 --> 00:41:42.306
can’t praise this spiritual work enough, and you have taken birth here,

00:41:42.306 --> 00:41:44.044
is that without any good deeds (punyas) in past lives?

00:41:44.044 --> 00:41:52.108
But it has been wasted, I did not take Samadhi at the age of 23 like Gyaneshwara,

00:41:52.108 --> 00:41:59.051
and even after all, there are some too clever, good for nothing.

00:41:59.051 --> 00:42:03.097
Yesterday, there was somebody who came saying that I am working to demolish the blind faith in people,

00:42:03.097 --> 00:42:08.655
so that is one thing. Whatever anybody comes up with, people will start following him,

00:42:08.655 --> 00:42:13.735
they will follow in thousands, to such filth.

00:42:13.735 --> 00:42:17.263
They have made so much money, Shri Mataji,

00:42:17.263 --> 00:42:20.199
and his wife has run off with Rajanish, I said: ‘is that so?’,

00:42:20.199 --> 00:42:23.711
maybe he did not give her any money.

00:42:23.711 --> 00:42:28.252
‘We used to worship him’. ‘Really’? Then you carry on doing so.

00:42:28.252 --> 00:42:42.553
What do you mean by saying that ‘we used to worship him’, ‘who are you’? You should ask yourself ‘Who are you?’. Humility should start right from here, who am I?

00:42:42.553 --> 00:42:52.312
I am a Sahaja Yogi. ‘Who has become the Spirit (Aatma), I am a Sahaja Yogi,

00:42:52.312 --> 00:42:57.089
and how should a Sahaja Yogi behave?

00:42:57.089 --> 00:43:07.108
You have an example of Gyaneshwar in front of you, you have an example of Tukaram in front of you,

00:43:07.108 --> 00:43:14.603
Ramdas and Ekanatha’s example is in front of you,

00:43:14.603 --> 00:43:23.170
didn´t you hear what they had to say? have you not witnessed that?

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:40.844
Namadeva, whom Shri Gurunanaka embraced, wasn’t that Namadeva, a tailor also from this Maharashtra?

00:43:40.844 --> 00:43:47.894
But what I see here, that they are busy just singing in his temple!

00:43:47.894 --> 00:43:55.767
Even if just ten tailors come to Sahaja Yoga then we should think that Namadeva´s existence has been worth it.

00:43:55.767 --> 00:44:08.975
Today I just want to pray to all those Saints that please take your birth here again in Maharashtra and put these people right.

00:44:08.975 --> 00:44:23.827
Sahaja Yoga has not progressed here as much as it should have, only Sahaja Yoga is growing (in numbers),

00:44:23.827 --> 00:44:31.397
as they say, that if something is weak and if you spread it too thin then it will get torn.

00:44:31.397 --> 00:44:37.357
I don’t hear all this over there (in a foreign country) that this is a different group and that is a different group,

00:44:37.357 --> 00:44:41.983
I do not see all this kind of quarrelling at all there.

00:44:41.983 --> 00:44:48.023
How can you have different groups in Sahaja Yoga?

00:44:48.023 --> 00:44:59.222
Shri Kartikeya himself took his birth here, they call Shri Saraswati, as ‘Skandamatar’.

00:44:59.222 --> 00:45:22.112
Actually, she was not his mother, she was a virgin, but she had embraced Shri Skanda(kartikeya) as her son.

00:45:22.112 --> 00:45:32.082
That Kartikeya chose this Maharashtra to take his birth!

00:45:32.082 --> 00:45:48.899
The whole world is inspired by what Gyaneshwara has written down, but here it is the opposite.

00:45:48.899 --> 00:45:54.364
They said that someone has come from America here, to build a University,

00:45:54.364 --> 00:46:05.163
‘Peace University’, here in Aalandi, so then what happened? They will not do any such thing here in Aalandi!

00:46:05.163 --> 00:46:09.111
Then they came and surrendered at my feet and said that Shri Mataji please now you do everything,

00:46:09.111 --> 00:46:17.739
we leave it to you now, we don’t want anything done by people in Maharashtra, we don’t want to deal with them.

00:46:17.739 --> 00:46:28.868
So, what happened was, there was some great person, who grabbed two and a half Crore rupees, from these poor Americans.

00:46:28.868 --> 00:46:32.922
Another person grabbed Three and half Crore.

00:46:32.922 --> 00:46:38.835
They ran away from there, they had enough of this Maharashtra.

00:46:38.835 --> 00:46:45.600
They said Shri Mataji wherever you will do it we will follow you there, please you do it, and do it in your name.

00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:50.523
We had only met for two hours.

00:46:50.523 --> 00:47:00.395
They were shocked by the behaviour of these people, and these people who fooled them and took their money were not even politicians.

00:47:00.395 --> 00:47:07.706
Absolutely everyone is running after money.

00:47:07.706 --> 00:47:20.623
The reason for telling you all this is because to achieve that depth, you have to look at yourself first (to correct yourself),

00:47:20.623 --> 00:47:29.329
you have to pay attention to yourself, and see that, have I got any of those qualities that Shri Mataji is talking about?

00:47:29.329 --> 00:47:42.057
I tell everybody that when the Kundalini is awakened, all your problems and all your status drop away,

00:47:42.057 --> 00:47:47.406
you get detached from everything and you bloom like a lotus,

00:47:47.406 --> 00:47:53.004
but I don’t see that in Maharashtra,

00:47:53.004 --> 00:48:09.747
and again their biggest concern will be that what ‘status’ am I going to get?

00:48:09.747 --> 00:48:16.872
They will complain that who is this person to give us orders, who is he to correct me?

00:48:16.872 --> 00:48:22.941
I don’t believe in leaders, and then he will write to me against him.

00:48:22.941 --> 00:48:32.957
They will tell me about his character, telling me that, Shri Mataji, you threw me out of Sahaja Yoga because of such a person, but he has a very bad character.

00:48:32.957 --> 00:48:35.768
Do you think I do not have a brain of my own?

00:48:35.768 --> 00:48:44.133
If I had to do things using your brains then, I don’t know what would have happened!

00:48:44.133 --> 00:48:49.438
The biggest problem here is: people are very ritualistic,

00:48:49.438 --> 00:48:55.144
like they will get up at 4 o’clock, have their bath, and sit in front of Shri Mataji for meditation,

00:48:55.144 --> 00:49:00.553
and then they will say: Shri Mataji, I do so much meditation and all that then why nothing goes right for me?

00:49:00.553 --> 00:49:05.640
I said look at your heart,you have not given me your heart, have you?

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:08.753
You have to give me your heart.

00:49:08.753 --> 00:49:13.460
Without having your heart, how could I fill it with anything?

00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:16.257
To fill it with love you have to have the ‘Heart’.

00:49:16.257 --> 00:49:20.754
I don’t think that the quarrelsome people have a heart.

00:49:20.754 --> 00:49:45.112
So the reason I told you all these things in today’s puja is that, you don´t have to be over smart, in marathi its said`don´t light the lamps´. Marathi language is like a sword,

00:49:45.112 --> 00:49:55.675
I mean to say that you have to light a lamp in your heart (awaken the spirit). As soon as there´s light in your heart, you will find out everything about yourself.

00:49:55.675 --> 00:50:01.872
When we were young, our Mother used to say, where is your attention?

00:50:01.872 --> 00:50:11.112
Now I understand its meaning. ‘Where is your attention? What is your aim?’

00:50:11.112 --> 00:50:16.282
‘To become a Saint!’

00:50:16.282 --> 00:50:30.986
All the anger, irritable behaviour, bringing in something new, all this kind of thing, will not be allowed in Sahaja Yoga.

00:50:30.986 --> 00:50:46.031
You should be peaceful by nature, take it from Amrutanubhava, how amazing it is,

00:50:46.031 --> 00:50:51.112
how Gyaneshwara has explained it to people,

00:50:51.112 --> 00:50:59.335
but where are those people now, who would understand it? They do not understand what he has written.

00:50:59.335 --> 00:51:07.483
So take to Amrutanubhava don’t go on reading scriptures in a ritualistic way.

00:51:07.483 --> 00:51:14.427
Read every word from it (Amrutanubhava) to see if you are anywhere at that level.

00:51:14.427 --> 00:51:26.472
A Sahaja Yogi who is completely satisfied, and joyful, become one with himself,

00:51:26.472 --> 00:51:33.117
he does not want any power or money, he has reached that level.

00:51:33.117 --> 00:51:43.582
He becomes the joy himself, he has a very special kind of personality.

00:51:43.582 --> 00:51:49.373
Here in Maharashtra there are some very great people in Sahaja Yoga,

00:51:49.373 --> 00:51:56.929
like especially chiselled diamonds, great very great,

00:51:56.929 --> 00:52:00.949
but the rest of them are just ordinary.

00:52:00.949 --> 00:52:11.275
There should be no rivalry amongst each other,

00:52:11.275 --> 00:52:20.450
nobody should write to me criticizing others,I do not like that at all.

00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:25.269
I do not like that at all. Not only me but nobody likes it,

00:52:25.269 --> 00:52:29.738
and there will be consequences of it, so please do not write to me such dirty letters.

00:52:29.738 --> 00:52:33.425
In your opinion, it might be very good, but just keep it to yourself.

00:52:33.425 --> 00:52:37.899
You don’t need to tell me anything I know everything.

00:52:37.899 --> 00:52:41.245
But you all have to know everything,

00:52:41.245 --> 00:52:46.404
Out of you people will come out jewel, I know that because this is a mine,

00:52:46.404 --> 00:52:52.897
and even if you could see only the cole in the mine, there are some real jewel.

00:52:52.897 --> 00:52:58.718
I have worked hard here for so many years,

00:52:58.718 --> 00:53:01.622
but if you have not recognized yourself then what can I do?

00:53:01.622 --> 00:53:14.372
The life of Gyaneshwara was so important, just 23 years of life, but very important. How must have he lived his life?

00:53:14.372 --> 00:53:19.086
He took his birth in a sanyasi (Ascetic) family, he did that on purpose,

00:53:19.086 --> 00:53:27.189
 to show people that, all this outward is just trivial, insignificant.

00:53:27.189 --> 00:53:37.272
He took his birth against all odds, to expose all pretentious and artificial nature.

00:53:37.272 --> 00:53:41.686
And he was tortured by all these pretentious people.

00:53:41.686 --> 00:53:45.973
Don’t let that happen in Sahaja Yoga.

00:53:45.973 --> 00:53:59.529
Just try and remember one thing about Mataji that I know everything about everybody.

00:53:59.529 --> 00:54:05.082
I do not need to be told anything.

00:54:05.082 --> 00:54:16.586
The only thing is that you have to recognize yourself.

00:54:16.586 --> 00:54:29.988
Instead of recognizing me, if you recognize yourself, then we should think that today’s Puja has been worthwhile (meaningful), no doubt about it.

00:54:29.988 --> 00:54:38.058
In North India, the work has started in a very big way,

00:54:38.058 --> 00:54:49.861
I don’t have a doubt about that, and there, the IAS officers have made an association amongst themselves,

00:54:49.861 --> 00:55:20.225
and if they find some people who are corrupt, whoever it may be, on any higher position, they will take an action against him.

00:55:20.225 --> 00:55:32.787
They will find out everything about his background, where has he come from, how he is making his money, everything, and then they will take him to court.

00:55:32.787 --> 00:55:39.233
I was asking these IAS people: how did you come to Sahaja Yoga?

00:55:39.233 --> 00:55:46.452
They said, Shri Mataji, it is such a big problem (corruption), we are very honest people, we don’t know how to be dishonest at all.

00:55:46.452 --> 00:56:00.967
We are also the same, my Husband and even my Son-in-law are the same, we can not be dishonest.

00:56:00.967 --> 00:56:05.991
So they thought now what to do, how to live with these corrupt people? They tell us to be dishonest,

00:56:05.991 --> 00:56:18.006
but then we found the way when we came to sahaj yoga, all of us like-minded, honest people formed a unity.

00:56:18.006 --> 00:56:21.903
Nobody fights with each other, nothing of the kind.

00:56:21.903 --> 00:56:27.664
And just like that, you all should also unite as Sahaja Yogis.

00:56:27.664 --> 00:56:52.388
Because we are standing on truth, and no one could make us move away from the truth, and the light of that truth is love.

00:56:52.388 --> 00:57:02.392
Gyaneshwara has clearly said that, where there is love amongst each other, only those people are your true relatives.

00:57:02.392 --> 00:57:05.694
They say we have Haldi-Kunku(a ritual in Sankranti, where women go round each others houses) program at our house, so I asked who will be coming?

00:57:05.694 --> 00:57:17.721
They will tell me, my aunt who believes in such and such god or another aunt who worships such and such guru are coming. But no sahaja yogis coming.

00:57:17.721 --> 00:57:25.564
Who are your relatives? These are your relatives (Sahaja yogis).

00:57:25.564 --> 00:57:34.029
These are your brothers and sisters, instead of talking against them, or go on fighting with them, fight with yourself.

00:57:34.029 --> 00:57:46.859
Today in the whole world, people have come together (united) through Sahaja Yoga,

00:57:46.859 --> 00:57:54.546
the thing I call collectivity is in real sense has been established all over.

00:57:54.546 --> 00:57:57.594
I could hear it echoing through all 65 countries.

00:57:57.594 --> 00:58:00.086
But I can not see anything like that in Maharashtra.

00:58:00.086 --> 00:58:10.934
You have to truly come together, whatever happens, we are Sahaja Yogis,

00:58:10.934 --> 00:58:20.395
and all others are strangers for us. Unless and until you realize this, you will not go deeper in Sahaja Yoga, because you are not collective.

00:58:20.395 --> 00:58:26.061
It is not going to happen unless you become a collective being.

00:58:26.061 --> 00:58:37.131
Now if you look at the sea, if there is a wave, it goes all over the sea,

00:58:37.131 --> 00:58:42.661
because the sea itself is collective, all the drops stay together,

00:58:42.661 --> 00:58:48.194
if one drop goes outside, then it will evaporate with the heat of the Sun.

00:58:48.194 --> 00:58:55.222
It is exactly like that in Sahaja Yoga, if you are in then you are properly in, otherwise you are not.

00:58:55.222 --> 00:59:05.800
Talking against each other, talking ill about each other, does not suit you.

00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:10.594
Today on the Puja day you have to cleanse your heart.

00:59:10.594 --> 00:59:21.603
And let the Ganges of love flow in such heart.

00:59:21.603 --> 00:59:30.122
Maharashtrians need to get rid of their snobbishness.

00:59:30.122 --> 00:59:38.011
‘I need to see Shri Mataji’, ‘Send a message to Shri Mataji’. No, there is no need for that,

00:59:38.011 --> 00:59:43.957
if you have to see me, then you can see me in your heart.

00:59:43.957 --> 00:59:47.572
Only there (in the Heart) I will meet you.

00:59:47.572 --> 00:59:49.647
All this is just too much.

00:59:49.647 --> 01:00:00.536
When they come to Pratishthan, I get bombarded with everybody wanting to see me. They feel as if they are `somebody special´

01:00:00.536 --> 01:00:04.313
 and must meet Shri Mataji. ‘I am a doctor’, OK you might be a doctor,

01:00:04.313 --> 01:00:10.300
go and sit in your dispensary, ‘I am a Barrister’ ‘I am this, I am that’,

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:13.471
‘I am a peon of a Chief Minister’.

01:00:13.471 --> 01:00:23.106
The variety of egos you can see in Maharashtra, you won’t be able to see anywhere else.

01:00:23.106 --> 01:00:25.850
It should not stick on to you (ego).

01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:35.472
The very reason you are called Maharashtrian, the very reason you are Maharashtrian,

01:00:35.472 --> 01:00:45.814
you are great people for being born in this Maharashtra, then why are you stuck in this mud?

01:00:45.814 --> 01:00:56.727
Wanting to be in the front all the time, showing off.

01:00:56.727 --> 01:01:07.295
These people who have come here (from abroad), you would not be able to tell who is the leader out of them!

01:01:07.295 --> 01:01:10.987
It is just not in them (showing off),

01:01:10.987 --> 01:01:16.379
because they know, humility is needed to be in Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:16.379 --> 01:01:24.460
In today’s Puja, I am giving you infinite blessings

01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:39.757
that you experience the oneness with your spirit, don’t be half-hearted (half baked), become complete.

01:01:39.757 --> 01:01:43.778
I am giving you this infinite blessing.

01:01:43.778 --> 01:02:07.152
I am sorry, I had to speak in Marathi language because I had to tell them something which I don’t want you to know (Laughter).

01:02:07.152 --> 01:02:18.103
Today is a great day, I should say in a way,

01:02:18.103 --> 01:02:25.071
because I am going to tell you one thing great.

01:02:25.071 --> 01:02:32.586
That is Shri Gyaneshwara – in Marathi they call it ‘Dnyaneshwara’ –

01:02:32.586 --> 01:02:40.671
He was the incarnation of Kartikeya.

01:02:40.671 --> 01:02:55.911
And Saraswati, who was a virgin, she looked after Him like Her own son.

01:02:55.911 --> 01:03:04.308
He was the brother of Shri Ganapati but She looked after Him.

01:03:04.308 --> 01:03:10.907
And then also there’s description how He was born and all those (things), is very interesting.

01:03:10.907 --> 01:03:22.205
But here in this place, in this Maharashtra, He took His incarnation.

01:03:22.205 --> 01:03:36.032
And also there were many great, great, very great saints in so many numbers took place, took their birth in this Maharashtra.

01:03:36.032 --> 01:03:45.592
But such horrible people, they tortured their lives.

01:03:45.592 --> 01:03:52.490
Worse than Christian Inquisition I tell you; worse than any inquisition anywhere.

01:03:52.490 --> 01:03:56.434
Individually they attacked.

01:03:56.434 --> 01:04:08.180
And that same people are born again in this great country of Maharashtra.

01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:16.593
They are very talented people; they write very well. Their language is so rich.

01:04:16.593 --> 01:04:37.131
You can see that, what description of a realized soul, given by Gyaneshwara, is so beautiful.

01:04:37.131 --> 01:04:50.612
He says that, “The moon doesn’t run after moonlight, the sun doesn’t run after sunlight.

01:04:50.612 --> 01:04:58.227
In that way a realized soul doesn’t bother about his own glory.

01:04:58.227 --> 01:05:09.340
The sun shines till it shines, then it takes back all his rays.

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:15.121
Whatever work the rays have to do they do it. And the sun is just watching,

01:05:15.121 --> 01:05:20.295
watching all the work, then he takes them back.

01:05:20.295 --> 01:05:28.484
And he gets completely contained within himself”.

01:05:28.484 --> 01:05:34.255
Samavun ghene, completely contained within himself.

01:05:34.255 --> 01:05:46.390
The description He has given of realized souls is so beautiful, if you could just experience it.

01:05:46.390 --> 01:06:03.480
Namadeva, who was born much later, said that even one line of Gyanesha [MEANS Saint Gyaneshwara, fondly called by a short name] if you could experience, you had that.

01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:08.131
I wish you all could read Amrutanubhava in English,

01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:12.619
understanding how He describes a realized soul,

01:06:12.619 --> 01:06:18.119
and you’ll find that within yourself it has happened.

01:06:18.119 --> 01:06:21.147
You are different from others very much.

01:06:21.147 --> 01:06:31.248
You’ll be amazed how you have got such beautiful description of your Self.

01:06:31.248 --> 01:06:38.524
I was talking about Maharashtrians; they are extremely talented people.

01:06:38.524 --> 01:06:45.512
See their music. In music no-one can beat them.

01:06:45.512 --> 01:06:50.006
See their drama. In drama no-one can beat them.

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:58.930
You can see from films. In Maharashtra only great films were created.

01:06:58.930 --> 01:07:11.552
The another one is Bengal, which is, I would say, different but of the same level.

01:07:11.552 --> 01:07:22.258
It’s such a talented people here, it shows that God has a special blessing for these two,

01:07:22.258 --> 01:07:29.025
and, should be, Maharashtrians should rise very high.

01:07:29.025 --> 01:07:37.286
But all the time complaining about others, talking ill of others, and something very low they do.

01:07:37.286 --> 01:07:43.343
I’m surprised it, I hope you don’t pick up anything from them.

01:07:43.343 --> 01:07:56.008
And also the fussiness that is of the North Indians; that’s also not a very good thing.

01:07:56.008 --> 01:08:06.172
It’s surprising how you people have adjusted yourself to this country, which has all kinds of parasites.

01:08:06.172 --> 01:08:13.823
Because you live with vibrations, you feel the vibrations.

01:08:13.823 --> 01:08:19.747
It’s something so great to see you all here,

01:08:19.747 --> 01:08:26.441
and I’m telling them that they should try to understand you people.

01:08:26.441 --> 01:08:33.218
Really I’m very proud of you all who have come all the way here.

01:08:33.218 --> 01:08:48.516
In this puja I am thinking of so many great saints who were born, who were great gurus, mahagurus.

01:08:48.516 --> 01:09:00.287
Of course Gyanesha, I must say, is the king of all those high, highly evolved souls, no doubt.

01:09:00.287 --> 01:09:14.636
So we are now having a puja on the twenty-fourth of December because it’s a Datta Jayanti, Dattatreya’s birth.

01:09:14.636 --> 01:09:18.410
And so we’ll be having on the twenty-fourth night.

01:09:18.410 --> 01:09:21.802
In any case it’s a Christmas Eve.

01:09:21.802 --> 01:09:30.345
We could all start with that. And also Dattatreya, who took His form in Maharashtra.

01:09:30.345 --> 01:09:38.471
Maharashtrians understand Dattatreya. They understand the Nath Panthis.

01:09:38.471 --> 01:09:48.966
These Nathas went all over. They went to Kiev. You’ll be amazed, they went even up to Bolivia,

01:09:48.966 --> 01:09:57.811
those who are from Maharashtra, from Rahuri. Can you imagine?

01:09:57.811 --> 01:10:08.795
Such great people they were, and that is what I expect to happen in this Maharashtra.

01:10:08.795 --> 01:10:17.022
And I’m sure one day I’ll be very much happy with all of them; not few.

01:10:17.022 --> 01:10:20.552
There are some very great Maharashtrians, no doubt,

01:10:20.552 --> 01:10:30.406
but all of them have to join together because I talk of synthesis, not of divisive method.

01:10:30.406 --> 01:10:37.263
I hope they understand the inner feeling that I have,

01:10:37.263 --> 01:10:45.726
otherwise all the good diamonds will be selected

01:10:45.726 --> 01:10:55.752
and the ones which are defective will be thrown away. What’s the use?

01:10:55.752 --> 01:11:03.880
But all of them are capable of achieving any height. They may belong to any caste, community, doesn’t matter;

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:10.606
but they are born in Maharashtra, which is such a great country.

01:11:10.606 --> 01:11:18.401
So today they wanted to do Mahalakshmi, this thing, we already have Mahalakshmi temple.

01:11:18.401 --> 01:11:22.573
And they have a great blessing of Mahalakshmi also, in a way,

01:11:22.573 --> 01:11:34.485
but they lack: one is the wisdom, and the second the spirit of Kartikeya.

01:11:34.485 --> 01:11:50.087
The spirit of Kartikeya – that pure,

01:11:50.087 --> 01:12:05.912
absolute dynamism which doesn’t indulge into nonsensical things and useless things; which shows the results.

01:12:05.912 --> 01:12:12.179
May God bless you all!
