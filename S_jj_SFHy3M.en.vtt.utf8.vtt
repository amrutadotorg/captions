00:02.630 --> 00:15.829
[Music]

00:09.900 --> 00:15.829
[Applause]

00:16.880 --> 00:21.810
my idea of coming to conduct me for

00:21.030 --> 00:25.380
Shibuya

00:21.810 --> 00:35.820
was this that Shiva represents the

00:25.380 --> 00:39.350
spirit and the spirit is residing in all

00:35.820 --> 00:39.350
of you in your hearts

00:43.690 --> 00:55.470
the seat of Sadashiva is on top of your

00:47.020 --> 00:55.470
head but is reflected in your heart

00:57.160 --> 01:02.700
now your brain is the bitter

01:05.570 --> 01:16.720
so to bring spirit to your brain means

01:09.790 --> 01:16.720
enlightenment of your brain

01:18.899 --> 01:28.439
enlightenment of your brain means the

01:25.439 --> 01:38.700
limited capacity of your brain has to

01:28.439 --> 01:40.950
become unlimited in its capacity to

01:38.700 --> 01:44.880
realize God we I will not use the word

01:40.950 --> 01:51.740
understand to realize God how powerful

01:44.880 --> 01:51.740
is how miraculous is how greatly

01:53.899 --> 02:06.520
the another is that the brain of man can

02:01.759 --> 02:06.520
create of course out of the dead

02:07.219 --> 02:14.950
but when T Spirit comes into brain

02:17.090 --> 02:26.860
then you create living things living

02:21.379 --> 02:26.860
work of Kundalini

02:27.550 --> 02:39.180
even the dead start behaving like living

02:32.070 --> 02:42.180
because you touch the spirit in the dead

02:39.180 --> 02:42.180
like

02:42.209 --> 02:56.370
the nucleus inside every atom or a

02:50.400 --> 03:02.400
molecule has the spirit of that molecule

02:56.370 --> 03:06.739
and if you become useful we can say the

03:02.400 --> 03:06.739
brain of

03:08.420 --> 03:16.250
a molecule or an atom is like the

03:12.890 --> 03:18.410
nucleus body of the nucleus but the one

03:16.250 --> 03:22.250
that controls a nucleus is the spirit

03:18.410 --> 03:27.550
that resides within the nucleus so now

03:22.250 --> 03:27.550
you have got the attention of the body

03:29.050 --> 03:37.190
the whole body of the atom then the

03:33.620 --> 03:40.640
nucleus and inside the nucleus is the

03:37.190 --> 03:43.480
spirit in the same way we have this body

03:40.640 --> 03:56.860
the attention of the body

03:43.480 --> 03:56.860
and then we have the we have

03:56.970 --> 03:59.960
the nucleus

04:03.000 --> 04:06.110
is the brain

04:07.530 --> 04:20.690
and the Spirit is in the heart so the

04:14.060 --> 04:20.690
brain is controlled through the spirit

04:20.750 --> 04:33.710
how that around the heart there are

04:30.660 --> 04:33.710
seven auras

04:36.720 --> 04:49.520
which can be multiplied into any number

04:40.580 --> 04:52.520
seven raised to power 1600 which are

04:49.520 --> 04:52.520
once

04:54.040 --> 04:56.610
which

04:56.759 --> 05:02.610
much

04:59.460 --> 05:04.759
the seven chakras needs to power 16 and

05:02.610 --> 05:04.759
eight

05:05.220 --> 05:08.430
16000 sorry

05:10.330 --> 05:18.820
now this

05:12.560 --> 05:18.820
spirit is watching through this aura

05:19.030 --> 05:30.550
watching I'm again Singh watching

05:22.000 --> 05:30.550
through this aura this aura is watching

05:31.060 --> 05:40.580
the behavior of your seven centers in

05:35.540 --> 05:44.330
your brain is also watching all the

05:40.580 --> 05:49.070
nerves that are working into being

05:44.330 --> 05:51.700
watching again but when you bring the

05:49.070 --> 05:51.700
spirit

05:55.380 --> 06:04.520
into your brain then you go to step side

06:06.780 --> 06:12.110
because when you have CUDA linearizes

06:12.800 --> 06:22.800
she catches the Sadashiva and Sadashiva

06:17.250 --> 06:27.570
informs the spirit informs the self

06:22.800 --> 06:34.490
reflects in the spirit so that's the

06:27.570 --> 06:34.490
first state where the watching or us

06:34.670 --> 06:49.640
start communicating through your

06:43.670 --> 06:54.900
different chakras in the brain and

06:49.640 --> 06:59.550
integrating it but when you bring your

06:54.900 --> 07:01.820
spirit to your brain this is the second

06:59.550 --> 07:01.820
state

07:04.300 --> 07:12.220
then you really become self-realized in

07:07.659 --> 07:18.340
the food in the food because then your

07:12.220 --> 07:24.940
scent that is the spirit becomes your

07:18.340 --> 07:29.440
brain action is very dynamic

07:24.940 --> 07:36.400
it opens then the fifth dimension in the

07:29.440 --> 07:39.009
human being first when you become

07:36.400 --> 07:42.639
realized collectively conscious and

07:39.009 --> 07:47.530
start raising the Kundalini you are in

07:42.639 --> 07:53.259
you cross the fourth dimension when your

07:47.530 --> 07:56.229
spirit comes into your brain then you

07:53.259 --> 07:58.919
become the fifth dimension means you

07:56.229 --> 07:58.919
become the doer

08:03.330 --> 08:08.730
our brain now for example says alright

08:05.910 --> 08:12.210
lift this thing up when you touch it

08:08.730 --> 08:16.650
with your hands you lift it you have the

08:12.210 --> 08:22.740
door but when the brain becomes the

08:16.650 --> 08:32.420
spirit the Spirit is the world and when

08:22.740 --> 08:32.420
spirit is the doer then you become

08:32.680 --> 08:39.180
a complete Shiva self-realized

08:39.680 --> 08:50.380
in that state if you get angry you are

08:47.720 --> 08:50.380
not attached

08:51.260 --> 08:57.889
you are not an attached person to

08:53.420 --> 08:59.930
anything what sir if you possess

08:57.889 --> 09:03.910
anything you are not attached

08:59.930 --> 09:11.870
you cannot attach because Felicity - not

09:03.910 --> 09:15.230
completely you don't bother about any

09:11.870 --> 09:17.889
attachments whatsoever even for a second

09:15.230 --> 09:17.889
you are not attached

09:21.690 --> 09:29.220
now I would say to understand the

09:26.700 --> 09:34.710
detachment of spirit we should study

09:29.220 --> 09:40.890
ourselves very well clearly how are we

09:34.710 --> 09:46.020
attached we are attached firstly by our

09:40.890 --> 09:48.650
brain mostly by our brain because all

09:46.020 --> 09:54.800
our conditionings are in the our brain

09:48.650 --> 09:54.800
and all over ego is also in our place

09:57.380 --> 10:07.470
so all emotional attachments are through

10:02.400 --> 10:11.240
our brain and all our egoistical

10:07.470 --> 10:11.240
attachments also are through our brain

10:12.410 --> 10:18.210
that's why it is said that after

10:14.550 --> 10:23.150
realization one must try to practice the

10:18.210 --> 10:25.710
Shiva tattva by practicing detachment

10:23.150 --> 10:30.600
now you just watch your attention where

10:25.710 --> 10:33.630
is it one watches as soon as you start

10:30.600 --> 10:35.400
watching yourself your attention you

10:33.630 --> 10:37.530
will become more identified with your

10:35.400 --> 10:39.000
spirit because if you have to watch your

10:37.530 --> 10:42.110
attention you have to be your strength

10:39.000 --> 10:42.110
otherwise how will you watch it

10:42.620 --> 10:52.130
the detachment is to be watched and seen

10:47.850 --> 10:52.130
through your own attachments

10:54.980 --> 11:00.649
now because you are realized Souls not

10:59.089 --> 11:02.689
yet the spirit has not come into your

11:00.649 --> 11:05.509
brain of course but still you're

11:02.689 --> 11:09.709
realized Souls so what you have you can

11:05.509 --> 11:15.049
do is at least to watch your attention

11:09.709 --> 11:22.549
you can do that you can watch your

11:15.049 --> 11:25.839
attention very clearly by seeing where

11:22.549 --> 11:25.839
your attention is way

11:27.570 --> 11:35.480
and then controlling your attention also

11:30.270 --> 11:35.480
isn't very simple

11:37.439 --> 11:45.929
to control your attention you have to

11:42.149 --> 11:52.559
just remove your attention from this to

11:45.929 --> 11:57.239
that try to change your priorities all

11:52.559 --> 12:04.279
this has to be done now so the spirit is

11:57.239 --> 12:04.279
like the ocean which has the light in it

12:04.369 --> 12:14.789
and when this ocean pours into the

12:10.079 --> 12:18.269
little cup of your brain the cup loses

12:14.789 --> 12:22.619
its identity and everything becomes

12:18.269 --> 12:25.679
virtually everything so it's the ocean

12:22.619 --> 12:32.129
that is the spirit well your brain is

12:25.679 --> 12:36.449
limited so the detachment from your

12:32.129 --> 12:39.209
limited brain has to be brought in all

12:36.449 --> 12:42.989
limitations of brain should be broken so

12:39.209 --> 12:47.119
that when this ocean fills that brain

12:42.989 --> 12:47.119
will break that

12:48.339 --> 12:56.800
little captain and every bit of that Cup

12:55.029 --> 13:00.699
she'll become colorful the whole

12:56.800 --> 13:04.240
atmosphere everything whatever relocate

13:00.699 --> 13:06.999
should be colorful color of the spirit

13:04.240 --> 13:10.300
with her life to the spirit and this

13:06.999 --> 13:13.499
light of the Spirit acts works thinks

13:10.300 --> 13:15.579
coordinates does everything

13:13.499 --> 13:20.170
this is the reason today

13:15.579 --> 13:22.379
I decided to bring Shiva tattva to the

13:20.170 --> 13:22.379
blade

13:23.510 --> 13:28.070
the first procedure is to take your

13:25.790 --> 13:32.770
brain towards the shooter by telling it

13:28.070 --> 13:35.090
see where are you going mr. brain

13:32.770 --> 13:38.090
putting attention to this reporting

13:35.090 --> 13:41.120
attention to that getting involved on

13:38.090 --> 13:46.520
detach become the brain yourself only

13:41.120 --> 13:49.310
the brain detach and then take this

13:46.520 --> 13:52.730
detached brain completely filled with

13:49.310 --> 13:56.870
the color of the spirit it will

13:52.730 --> 13:59.420
automatically happen so today I hope we

13:56.870 --> 14:06.860
all pray that O Lord give us strength

13:59.420 --> 14:09.080
and that source of attraction by which

14:06.860 --> 14:11.990
we give up all the refractions of all

14:09.080 --> 14:14.150
the pleasures of joy of ego of

14:11.990 --> 14:17.270
everything that we think of but we

14:14.150 --> 14:23.570
should fall into the pure joy form of

14:17.270 --> 14:26.680
the sheer thought oh absolutely

14:23.570 --> 14:26.680
you got richer

14:28.110 --> 14:35.940
