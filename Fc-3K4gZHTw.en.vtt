00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:41.709
I’m sorry for being late.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:49.000
I did not know that this programme is in a beautiful place like this.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:04.500
And here you see a beautiful painting of Michelangelo

00:01:06.291 --> 00:01:16.417
expressing the desire of the Divine, your Father, to save you,

00:01:17.917 --> 00:01:23.625
to help you out, and is working out.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:49.542
In Germany we have had very great aggressive happenings

00:01:51.291 --> 00:02:06.750
and that brought forth a devastating effect on the Western life, all over.

00:02:07.208 --> 00:02:11.000
The value systems were broken,

00:02:11.417 --> 00:02:17.000
the idea of dharma was disturbed,

00:02:18.417 --> 00:02:22.417
women started behaving like men

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and so many people died.

00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:32.417
Very young people died, very very young.

00:02:32.625 --> 00:02:36.417
All their desires were not fulfilled,

00:02:36.625 --> 00:02:52.625
all their life gave them nothing but war.

00:02:57.083 --> 00:03:00.709
That was a kind of a heatwave that came,

00:03:02.417 --> 00:03:06.500
destroying all the subtler things.

00:03:07.834 --> 00:03:14.542
When the nature gets its respite, or is angry,

00:03:15.125 --> 00:03:21.000
it destroys only gross things

00:03:22.125 --> 00:03:25.834
but when human beings start destroying

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.291
they destroy even the subtler things like their value system,

00:03:34.625 --> 00:03:41.917
your character, your chastity, your innocence, your forbearance.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.834
So now the war is on on the subtler level.

00:03:52.291 --> 00:03:55.375
We have to now understand

00:03:55.625 --> 00:04:02.625
that all these things have brought such a shattering effect in the West,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.750
on the Western personality.

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:18.750
So the first effort one has to do is to repair it,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.458
to put it straight, make it stand on its own legs.

00:04:30.709 --> 00:04:37.125
Because people lost their personality, their tradition,

00:04:39.625 --> 00:04:42.542
they had no moorings, no roots

00:04:44.125 --> 00:04:49.417
and they started moving towards anything

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:58.999
that was brought in as some sort of a intellectual experience.

00:05:04.208 --> 00:05:07.500
The women became very independent

00:05:07.542 --> 00:05:12.917
and they thought they can work out their own problems.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.709
That they thought they can become like men.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Here the problem started even in a worse way.

00:05:30.333 --> 00:05:32.208
Because woman is a woman

00:05:32.625 --> 00:05:37.083
and a very little thing which is, call it, a man in her

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.417
and when she tries to avoid what she has

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:49.000
and develop something that she has very little

00:05:50.417 --> 00:05:54.500
then she becomes funny.

00:05:55.917 --> 00:06:00.000
But she may be possessed by so many men who are dead,

00:06:02.208 --> 00:06:10.125
her desire to become manly can attract so many bhoots

00:06:10.625 --> 00:06:14.000
who want to enter into a woman’s mind.

00:06:16.125 --> 00:06:22.625
And when they enter they have the garb of a woman

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:27.125
and mind of a devil.

00:06:30.542 --> 00:06:32.999
And the women can not see it

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.709
because maybe with those devilish things

00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:40.083
in the wordly way they might be successful.

00:06:41.417 --> 00:06:46.500
They might be better off. Maybe they can dominate everyone,

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:53.917
they might become meticulous like men, absolutely matter of fact,

00:06:56.709 --> 00:07:04.500
very neat, tidy, clean, devoid of all beauty and sweetness.

00:07:10.125 --> 00:07:20.709
Then these women ultimately become like vampires

00:07:22.291 --> 00:07:25.333
so though the war is over

00:07:25.333 --> 00:07:30.417
it is working through the women of Germany, I think.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.709
I’d heard this attack had come before also

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:43.999
and there were women called as Amazonic.

00:07:48.917 --> 00:07:52.208
Now that history is repeating itself again.

00:07:54.208 --> 00:07:57.333
The other day I had an interview with a German lady

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:02.417
and I was amazed at her attitude

00:08:02.999 --> 00:08:08.000
because I felt she’s still a Nazi in her, some Nazi bhoot is sitting in her.

00:08:08.834 --> 00:08:11.917
She was a double personality, one way she was talking sweetly,

00:08:11.959 --> 00:08:15.000
another way she was a Nazi

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and a fascist.

00:08:21.083 --> 00:08:29.709
And very cunningly they have got arguments.

00:08:31.417 --> 00:08:34.709
The first thing they can do is to say

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:42.125
that we are siding with downtrodden people, like India.

00:08:43.291 --> 00:08:44.959
Indians are Aryans, we are Aryans

00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:54.709
and we are people who are sympathising with Aryans.

00:08:57.542 --> 00:08:59.417
Indians are spiritual people

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.625
and they feel they are like Indians of all the things, you know, can you believe it?

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:13.417
The quality of life should improve, is the point.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:20.834
The quality of men is different from that of women,

00:09:20.999 --> 00:09:23.083
I have told you many a times.

00:09:24.709 --> 00:09:29.709
And if women try to be manly

00:09:30.917 --> 00:09:33.750
then they cannot achieve anything proper.

00:09:33.999 --> 00:09:36.000
We have had many like this.

00:09:36.417 --> 00:09:40.000
You have seen Mao`s wife.

00:09:41.917 --> 00:09:45.000
You have seen Mrs Chanka Sheik.

00:09:45.542 --> 00:09:49.834
Now this new lady Carlos,

00:09:49.917 --> 00:09:53.542
Carlos her name is? Marcos, Marcos.

00:09:54.709 --> 00:09:56.834
So many women like this.

00:09:58.291 --> 00:10:02.125
They always make a mess of things when they try to be manly.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.999
In the history we have many women.

00:10:07.417 --> 00:10:11.625
In India women are very well equipped.

00:10:11.667 --> 00:10:14.125
we have had women like Jhansi ki Rani

00:10:14.208 --> 00:10:18.291
who fought against the British. She was a widow.

00:10:18.333 --> 00:10:24.750
She tied her child on her back and fought the British.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.333
They say that her horse jumped from 180ft

00:10:33.999 --> 00:10:37.000
from the turret of a fort

00:10:38.625 --> 00:10:40.959
and the Britishers have written down that

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.417
‘Though we have got Jhansi the victory comes to us

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.709
but glory goes to Jhansi ki Rani’.

00:10:48.999 --> 00:10:50.750
We have had great women in India.

00:10:50.792 --> 00:10:52.959
Like Nur Jahan was another great woman,

00:10:53.083 --> 00:10:56.000
we had Chand Bibi, Ahalyabai

00:10:56.208 --> 00:11:00.000
but they were all women, they didn’t have ego of men.

00:11:02.542 --> 00:11:08.834
When it comes to one can work, work in the offices with men

00:11:08.917 --> 00:11:11.750
but they need not become men.

00:11:11.834 --> 00:11:14.959
I’ll tell you an example of my own.

00:11:16.291 --> 00:11:19.500
I had to build our house in Lucknow.

00:11:21.917 --> 00:11:27.417
I did it in real woman style

00:11:27.999 --> 00:11:29.999
and I built a very good house,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.999
better than any man could build in a very very cheap way.

00:11:39.542 --> 00:11:43.000
Like a man would go, first of all he’ll get an architect,

00:11:44.291 --> 00:11:46.000
go and measure everything,

00:11:46.999 --> 00:11:49.999
then he’ll try to fit everything into it beforehand.

00:11:50.417 --> 00:11:55.333
Then he will in his ego go to some expensive place shop

00:11:55.625 --> 00:11:59.000
get something expensive, be cheated by that.

00:12:02.959 --> 00:12:08.208
Then again in his ego he’ll go and get some very expensive labour

00:12:09.208 --> 00:12:13.417
and appoint somebody, he’ll be in charge of everything, in charge.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.208
I did it in a very different way.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
I had money, so went and found out

00:12:25.834 --> 00:12:30.250
who have the best people, who have the best bricks.

00:12:30.999 --> 00:12:34.000
The house was to be built by bricks.

00:12:35.417 --> 00:12:37.959
Then what else do you need?

00:12:37.999 --> 00:12:41.834
Just like a woman would cook her food, you see.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.834
You need also sand, all right.

00:12:45.834 --> 00:12:52.959
Then you need cement and you need iron bars, and labour.

00:12:54.709 --> 00:12:58.000
So I didn’t go the way men went round.

00:13:00.083 --> 00:13:06.999
I found out the man who was selling the best bricks.

00:13:09.917 --> 00:13:13.542
So he said: “I have no money because I have to put up those kiln

00:13:13.999 --> 00:13:16.250
and fill them up with the bricks

00:13:16.333 --> 00:13:20.834
and for that you require initial money.

00:13:21.709 --> 00:13:25.500
I said: “Alright, I’ll buy one whole kiln from you, whole one.

00:13:27.083 --> 00:13:29.083
How much will you take from me?”

00:13:29.417 --> 00:13:31.125
He said: “Five thousand rupees sufficient.”

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.625
But if he said, “If the kiln goes off,

00:13:34.834 --> 00:13:37.333
or there’s something wrong with it, if it misfired,

00:13:37.417 --> 00:13:39.625
then it is your lookout. I said: “Doesn’t matter.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:42.625
You put one kiln in my name.”

00:13:42.999 --> 00:13:45.999
So I bought a complete kiln from him, complete.

00:13:49.333 --> 00:13:54.291
kiln is a thing where they put all the bricks, you see,

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:58.291
and then cover it with mud and fire it from down.

00:13:58.417 --> 00:14:01.834
Sometimes it could be that the whole thing can go into a waste

00:14:02.834 --> 00:14:05.834
or crumple down

00:14:05.959 --> 00:14:08.583
I said: "You do like that. Only 5.000."

00:14:11.999 --> 00:14:14.083
When it is nicely fired and all that

00:14:14.208 --> 00:14:17.208
it would cost you nothing short of 50,000 rupees.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.041
Then I went to the river and I said:

00:14:25.208 --> 00:14:31.000
“How much for a one part?” – as they call it, a big area of sand.

00:14:31.959 --> 00:14:37.542
They said: “At this time, when it is summertime, it is very little,

00:14:37.999 --> 00:14:40.999
but in wintertime it will be quite a lot.”

00:14:41.542 --> 00:14:45.917
A man would go, he’d say “Alright, now you need so much, bring it now.

00:14:45.999 --> 00:14:48.417
Then you will need more, you bring it now.”

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:52.291
But I didn’t do that, I said “Summertime is a nice thing,

00:14:52.333 --> 00:14:54.625
cheap you are getting, why not buy the whole?”

00:14:54.709 --> 00:14:59.999
So I bought the whole part, the whole area of that sand.

00:15:02.125 --> 00:15:05.542
All right. Then I went for the ironmongers.

00:15:05.625 --> 00:15:07.709
I said: "Now what about iron?"

00:15:07.999 --> 00:15:10.417
They said: “You have to order

00:15:10.999 --> 00:15:15.999
but if you order in bulk then we’ll give you much cheaper.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.083
And cash down you have to pay so much.” I said “Alright.”

00:15:19.125 --> 00:15:24.125
I ordered it. So it was all ready, just like we do for cooking,

00:15:24.208 --> 00:15:27.000
you get everything ready made, ready there.

00:15:27.083 --> 00:15:29.542
Then what we needed was wood.

00:15:29.625 --> 00:15:31.500
So they said “Wood will come from Nepal.”

00:15:31.625 --> 00:15:35.500
I said “Alright. What else?”

00:15:35.625 --> 00:15:37.834
They said: “From any other forest it can come.”

00:15:37.999 --> 00:15:45.750
So I went to a forest in the centre of India called Jabalpur

00:15:45.834 --> 00:15:48.834
and there I ordered.

00:15:48.999 --> 00:15:52.417
The whole wood was cut, newly cut.

00:15:52.917 --> 00:15:57.291
and in an auction I bought a lot of wood from there.

00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:03.000
And I got all that there, plus I got the marble from there.

00:16:03.125 --> 00:16:06.500
This marble was never used before, anywhere.

00:16:08.125 --> 00:16:12.333
I said: “It’s very simple, I can use this marble for everything.”

00:16:12.417 --> 00:16:17.834
So I got marble and wood together from that place.

00:16:19.083 --> 00:16:24.625
Then the labour. Then I asked my friends

00:16:24.709 --> 00:16:30.750
if they knew any good workers who are good at masonary work.

00:16:30.834 --> 00:16:33.500
They said: “Yes, this one is good, that one is good”

00:16:33.583 --> 00:16:36.625
so I call all of them. I said, “See now you can stay with me in this house

00:16:36.667 --> 00:16:40.000
and I’ll feed you very well and I’ll give you food

00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:42.417
and I’ll look after you very well.”

00:16:42.959 --> 00:16:46.500
So they all settled down with their family

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
and I used to cook for them.

00:16:50.542 --> 00:16:55.959
By cooking I won them over and they would do anything for me.

00:16:58.542 --> 00:17:02.417
Absolutely. They’re so kind to me,

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:07.667
they would produce new, new technique that they knew,

00:17:07.999 --> 00:17:14.291
they would produce an effect of marble out of the cement.

00:17:15.291 --> 00:17:19.417
All kinds of art that they had they put there.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.458
So such a big house with 20 bedrooms and five drawing rooms dining rooms

00:17:25.999 --> 00:17:29.417
was created within one year’s time.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:34.750
Not only that but the price of the house nobody can believe

00:17:35.999 --> 00:17:40.792
was one tenth of the one that the architect would have taken.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.500
But it was all written so well, everything done so well

00:17:45.542 --> 00:17:48.333
because I didn’t know how to write accounts so what I used to do,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.500
every day I used to say “Alright, today I take out so much money,

00:17:54.417 --> 00:17:58.000
then this much was spent. Like that I wrote every day

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.999
and not one single rupee was missing in that.

00:18:03.999 --> 00:18:07.125
So nobody could prosecute me, no problem

00:18:07.208 --> 00:18:10.291
otherwise all the officers who built their houses there

00:18:10.375 --> 00:18:12.500
had to go through lots of problems,

00:18:12.625 --> 00:18:16.625
their income was taxed, this thing, nothing, nothing happened.

00:18:17.959 --> 00:18:21.417
And I got such a huge house made in such a little money

00:18:21.542 --> 00:18:23.542
and such a house that people said

00:18:23.625 --> 00:18:27.000
that even Taj Mahal may fall down, this will not fall.

00:18:28.417 --> 00:18:30.709
As I made a good foundation, everything,

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:32.875
because I had bricks so cheap.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.166
The whole of that kiln I bought for no price at all

00:18:37.291 --> 00:18:40.999
and half of it I sold back because so much remaining.

00:18:42.834 --> 00:18:45.208
Then whatever I had bought the sand I brought it,

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:47.999
sold half of it because I didn't need it,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.834
at double the price so I got my sand free.

00:18:54.208 --> 00:18:56.250
The wood that I had brought from there

00:18:56.333 --> 00:18:59.125
I got it properly chiseled out

00:18:59.375 --> 00:19:01.333
and I had a little tank in which I put it

00:19:01.417 --> 00:19:08.625
so the whole thing became absolutely, what you call that, weatherproof.

00:19:08.999 --> 00:19:14.625
I got it out and half of it I used, half of it only,

00:19:14.999 --> 00:19:20.000
for hundred windows and sixty doors and the rest of it I sold.

00:19:20.083 --> 00:19:24.834
And even the chips were sold as burning for wood,

00:19:24.917 --> 00:19:27.999
you see burning wood, what do you call that?

00:19:28.417 --> 00:19:30.792
So you can imagine something was sold as timber

00:19:30.999 --> 00:19:33.083
and some for the huts,

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.834
but I had to do cooking for them,

00:19:37.999 --> 00:19:40.208
I had to look after their comfort,

00:19:40.417 --> 00:19:45.834
I got them nice blankets and nice beds to sleep and this and that

00:19:45.999 --> 00:19:47.999
so they were very happy.

00:19:48.542 --> 00:19:52.000
That’s how a woman works out and everybody was amazed.

00:19:52.083 --> 00:19:54.959
They could not find any faults with my, accounts,

00:19:54.999 --> 00:19:57.000
they could not find faults with anything

00:19:57.083 --> 00:20:01.959
and I told all my husband’s friends to keep five miles away from me.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.709
Because he was working with the Prime Minister,

00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:13.667
people would have said that: “Alright, She’s taking bribes” and things like that.

00:20:13.999 --> 00:20:17.000
Then there was, another problem was that,

00:20:17.083 --> 00:20:21.125
they would have come and told me: “This not good, that not good.”

00:20:21.166 --> 00:20:25.999
I kept them out because only they can argue, men can only argue.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.417
Women produce the results.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.250
No conferences, nothing. I said: "Nothing doing",

00:20:36.333 --> 00:20:38.417
"Let me do the job Myself."

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:43.709
Very nicely in the company of all these people I built the house,

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:48.917
a beautiful house which I think they have taken a film,

00:20:49.625 --> 00:20:53.208
and you might be able to see the house that I built there.

00:20:56.125 --> 00:20:59.583
So when the woman, who is a Sahaja yogini

00:20:59.625 --> 00:21:02.583
must develop her special qualities

00:21:02.834 --> 00:21:05.917
because she is very intuitive, woman is very intuitive.

00:21:05.959 --> 00:21:09.291
She always reaches the right conclusion in no time.

00:21:09.333 --> 00:21:14.333
If she’s a woman – but if she’s half-man and a little of a woman

00:21:14.417 --> 00:21:17.999
then I don’t know what sort of a thing she is.

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:22.959
So a woman should try to be a woman, she’s so powerful,

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.709
she’s powerful like this Mother Earth who can bear every sort of thing

00:21:27.542 --> 00:21:33.083
and she can give the best that is with her.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Extremely sacrificing, extremely giving, forbearing, loving, forgiving.

00:21:43.959 --> 00:21:49.000
When men develop the women’s quality then they become saints.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.959
But not the woman’s quality that they run after women.

00:21:58.333 --> 00:22:00.709
This kind of a nonsense is not there.

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:03.542
They have to be viras, they have to be chivalrous people,

00:22:03.625 --> 00:22:07.000
They have to be brave

00:22:07.083 --> 00:22:14.999
but with that they have to develop compassion, forgiveness.

00:22:19.834 --> 00:22:22.917
But I think it is the other way round in Germany very much,

00:22:22.999 --> 00:22:25.500
and I find around also among Western Sahaja Yogis

00:22:25.583 --> 00:22:27.834
this is a very common affair going on.

00:22:27.917 --> 00:22:31.333
Women develop horrible egos.

00:22:33.625 --> 00:22:38.125
In India women work. Everything they do.

00:22:39.542 --> 00:22:44.208
We have had great orators since long time, well known.

00:22:45.417 --> 00:22:50.917
But they don’t have ego. My mother was Honours,

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.417
in those days when there were only two or three women

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.417
who had done such a degree,

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.999
but I never saw her with any ego in her.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.709
My own daughters, one of them has done architecture,

00:23:06.291 --> 00:23:09.125
and also interior decoration, she she’s not now working

00:23:09.208 --> 00:23:11.125
because her husband is working all right,

00:23:11.208 --> 00:23:13.917
but she makes houses for others, she draws for others,

00:23:13.959 --> 00:23:19.709
she helps others freely. And she has such friends.

00:23:21.083 --> 00:23:24.000
So what is the achievement of a woman?

00:23:24.208 --> 00:23:28.250
She has more people around her.

00:23:31.417 --> 00:23:33.000
Human power.

00:23:34.125 --> 00:23:37.291
She has more human beings around her.

00:23:38.333 --> 00:23:40.208
And what is the capacity of men?

00:23:40.333 --> 00:23:42.959
They have all the bills of the house to be paid,

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:49.417
they have to pay for the insurance, the repairs of the car.

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:53.417
Let them do the dirty jobs.

00:23:56.291 --> 00:24:00.125
Women receive all the love letters, from the children,

00:24:00.208 --> 00:24:02.542
from the husband, from everyone.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.500
They are loved. They are cared for.

00:24:09.542 --> 00:24:11.500
Now because they have become manly

00:24:11.959 --> 00:24:14.083
they don’t have all these advantages.

00:24:14.208 --> 00:24:18.750
Like formerly if you are going in a bus they would give a seat to a lady.

00:24:18.834 --> 00:24:20.291
Now nobody does that.

00:24:20.709 --> 00:24:25.375
Once a lady was travelling, old lady

00:24:25.417 --> 00:24:28.000
and there was one young fellow sitting there.

00:24:28.125 --> 00:24:30.417
I said: “Why don’t you allow her to sit down?”

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:31.417
He said: “Why should I?

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:33.917
She’s also wearing a pant, I’m also wearing a pant.”

00:24:33.959 --> 00:24:37.291
She was...this old lady was wearing trousers,

00:24:37.333 --> 00:24:40.834
so he said: “Why should I give her seat, she’s wearing a trouser,

00:24:40.999 --> 00:24:43.834
I’m wearing a trouser, what’s the difference?”

00:24:47.291 --> 00:24:50.000
So all that is our advantage and privilege

00:24:50.417 --> 00:24:53.625
we are losing by becoming men.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.000
And what do we gain?

00:25:01.417 --> 00:25:04.834
Actually, on the contrary, I think in modern days

00:25:04.917 --> 00:25:08.709
women are much more slaves of men than they were before.

00:25:10.208 --> 00:25:14.000
They get very upset. Say there’s a Sahaja Yogini.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.875
Now she’s caught up very badly and she has certain problems.

00:25:18.999 --> 00:25:21.000
First thing she’ll think about

00:25:21.083 --> 00:25:23.333
“Oh God, now my husband will leave me,

00:25:23.417 --> 00:25:27.208
he’ll take away my children, where will I do?”

00:25:27.291 --> 00:25:29.083
She’ll never think of Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:30.333 --> 00:25:33.750
But I met one extraordinary woman, I must say she was a real woman.

00:25:34.542 --> 00:25:37.750
She said: “Mother, because I’m schizophrenic

00:25:37.834 --> 00:25:42.083
I want to get out of Sahaja Yoga. I’ll divorce my husband,

00:25:42.834 --> 00:25:44.083
I don’t want to see my children,

00:25:44.125 --> 00:25:47.083
Sahaja Yoga is much more important than me,

00:25:47.208 --> 00:25:51.875
than my husband and my children."

00:25:51.999 --> 00:25:53.583
"There's a woman", I said.

00:25:53.625 --> 00:25:55.917
She said: “I am schizophrenic from childhood.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.709
I’ve discovered it now and it comes back on me”.

00:25:58.834 --> 00:26:01.125
But mostly women are worried about themselves.

00:26:01.208 --> 00:26:03.208
“Oh God, I’ll have to leave my husband,”

00:26:04.333 --> 00:26:07.750
means what they were doing was to sponge on the husband.

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:11.750
“I’ll have to leave my children.”

00:26:13.917 --> 00:26:16.999
But what about leaving Sahaja Yoga?

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:20.417
If you think Sahaja Yoga is the most important

00:26:20.625 --> 00:26:22.917
you’ll can get rid of your schizophrenia also.

00:26:22.959 --> 00:26:26.208
Why should God help you? We are just thinking like ordinary women,

00:26:26.291 --> 00:26:28.625
about yourself, only worried about yourself.

00:26:31.083 --> 00:26:34.000
Not worried about Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:37.291 --> 00:26:41.291
Same with some men, but men are not so much frightened

00:26:42.917 --> 00:26:45.750
because they think they can stand on their legs.

00:26:46.709 --> 00:26:49.000
And women should also know now they are Sahaja Yoginis

00:26:49.083 --> 00:26:52.000
that they are Sahaja Yoginis and Mother is going to look after them.

00:26:52.834 --> 00:26:55.500
But if you are worried about yourself only, your husband,

00:26:55.583 --> 00:27:01.333
my house, my children, then you are a gone case,

00:27:01.417 --> 00:27:04.417
you are no more a woman now. It’s not the sign of a good woman.

00:27:06.208 --> 00:27:10.333
A woman is that who loves all the children.

00:27:13.208 --> 00:27:16.917
Her loving capacity’s great, but if she becomes miserly,

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.625
if she becomes small-minded, then she’s not a woman.

00:27:22.959 --> 00:27:24.417
I told you about my grand-daughters,

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:27.208
I asked them: “What do you want to be?” They’re very small.

00:27:27.709 --> 00:27:33.999
So they said: “We want to be a nurse or an air hostess.”

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:37.083
So I said: “Why? What is so great about these jobs?”

00:27:38.125 --> 00:27:41.834
They said: “Grandmother in these two jobs only you can feed people.”

00:27:44.417 --> 00:27:47.083
There’s no other job in which you can really feed other.

00:27:47.166 --> 00:27:53.000
The joy of feeding others is greater than writing files in the office.

00:27:55.625 --> 00:28:00.208
Absolutely I tell you. It’s a horrid job to write files in the office, see.

00:28:05.625 --> 00:28:07.709
It’s better to do some nice cooking,

00:28:07.792 --> 00:28:13.000
thinking so many are going to eat and enjoy it,

00:28:13.083 --> 00:28:16.417
than to do this dirty job.

00:28:17.709 --> 00:28:20.917
But women have lost their heads, they are not level-headed now.

00:28:20.999 --> 00:28:23.999
Become stupid.

00:28:26.125 --> 00:28:30.291
Now in Germany you have to be very careful.

00:28:30.333 --> 00:28:32.000
In Austria you have to be very careful.

00:28:32.083 --> 00:28:35.125
Austrian women are great but I would say German women

00:28:35.208 --> 00:28:37.208
that you don’t try to become men.

00:28:37.291 --> 00:28:42.208
First of all the best way to stop it is not to talk too much.

00:28:45.417 --> 00:28:49.750
If you start talking like men then all the bhoots will enter into you

00:28:49.834 --> 00:28:52.500
and start talking like men only.

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:55.291
And then you will see how the men are controlled –

00:28:55.375 --> 00:28:59.709
we Indian women know how to control our men much better than you do.

00:29:02.959 --> 00:29:06.750
Why we don’t have divorces? Why we don’t have problems?

00:29:06.834 --> 00:29:08.750
We quarrel all right, doesn’t matter,

00:29:08.834 --> 00:29:11.291
but our men don’t run after another women.

00:29:13.542 --> 00:29:17.959
We don’t dress up s.., I mean, so much, we don’t go to hairdressers,

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.291
we don’t have these beauty aids, all that.

00:29:23.333 --> 00:29:25.917
So develop your self-respect.

00:29:25.999 --> 00:29:30.291
You are the Shakti. You are the power.

00:29:32.125 --> 00:29:35.834
If you make your men cabbages what sort of children you’ll have?

00:29:35.917 --> 00:29:40.333
Cabbages only. Respect them.

00:29:41.125 --> 00:29:43.917
Make them men, enjoy their manliness.

00:29:45.542 --> 00:29:49.000
Then they’ll never give you up.

00:29:50.291 --> 00:29:52.625
There’s no competition between the two.

00:29:54.291 --> 00:29:57.750
I find the main problem today in Gemany is

00:29:57.834 --> 00:30:00.709
that the women have lost their senses.

00:30:00.792 --> 00:30:04.917
This is I feel absolutely about German women.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:13.625
Take to music, take to art. So much scope is there.

00:30:13.709 --> 00:30:19.500
Today, who is remembered? See in here, who is remembered?

00:30:19.542 --> 00:30:24.083
A musician, Mozart. Everyone remembers Mozart,

00:30:24.166 --> 00:30:28.417
even on a chocolate you’ll find a Mozart there.

00:30:30.208 --> 00:30:33.917
I don’t know poor thing did he ever eat any chocolates or not.

00:30:37.125 --> 00:30:43.000
Or they will remember, see here, they have Michelangelo

00:30:43.083 --> 00:30:48.542
or they’ll have Leonardo da Vinci, or they’ll have somebody like that.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
Nobody remembers who was the officer at that time,

00:30:57.208 --> 00:30:59.291
running with the file, up and down.

00:31:06.083 --> 00:31:10.917
So women have something that they can be of eternal value,

00:31:11.291 --> 00:31:12.709
that they should develop.

00:31:12.792 --> 00:31:16.500
The greatest thing is that woman can love, and love and love.

00:31:16.583 --> 00:31:18.750
But when she becomes selfish and self-centred,

00:31:18.834 --> 00:31:23.083
starts worrying about herself there’s no beauty in her love.

00:31:25.917 --> 00:31:28.000
Today I took it up specially this thing

00:31:28.083 --> 00:31:31.000
because today you are worshipping me as Kartiyeka.

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:37.000
Kartikeya was the son of Parvati Umar.

00:31:44.542 --> 00:31:50.500
Who was just a mother of these two children, Ganesha and Kartikeya.

00:31:53.625 --> 00:32:04.333
And one day the parents Shankara and Parvati both of them said:

00:32:04.417 --> 00:32:13.709
“Out of you two, the one who goes round the Mother Earth first time

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.999
will get a special prize.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:27.208
So Kartikeya was the manly power,absolutely, and he said:

00:32:27.291 --> 00:32:32.542
"Alright, I’ll start on his own conveyance” which was a peacock.

00:32:32.999 --> 00:32:36.125
And Ganesha said to himself:

00:32:36.208 --> 00:32:38.709
“Now look at me, I’m a little boy,

00:32:39.417 --> 00:32:44.709
I am not like him and my conveyance is a little mouse.

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:48.917
How will I manage?” But then he thought:

00:32:50.125 --> 00:32:54.417
'My Mother is higher than the whole universe.'

00:32:54.625 --> 00:32:57.542
'What is this Mother Earth?’

00:32:57.999 --> 00:33:02.291
So this Kartykeya was out, going round the Mother Earth.

00:33:03.417 --> 00:33:06.333
Shri Ganesha went round his Mother three times.

00:33:07.125 --> 00:33:10.417
And he got the prize!

00:33:12.125 --> 00:33:16.208
Because of that motherly qualities for Him She’s the highest,

00:33:16.291 --> 00:33:19.125
even higher than Sadashiva.

00:33:21.709 --> 00:33:24.999
But surprisingly that is what Sadashiva likes.

00:33:25.291 --> 00:33:28.834
That you respect your mother. The motherhood in you.

00:33:29.917 --> 00:33:31.999
The womanhood in you.

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:39.417
‘Where the women are respectable and respected

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.709
there the Gods reside.’

00:33:42.625 --> 00:33:44.417
Women are very important.

00:33:44.458 --> 00:33:46.792
Of course I must blame the Western men also.

00:33:46.834 --> 00:33:49.000
the way they have ill-treated their women,

00:33:49.417 --> 00:33:53.083
have kept out of religion,, have always put them down,

00:33:53.166 --> 00:33:55.000
I mean, India we had Muslims doing that

00:33:55.208 --> 00:33:58.834
but they are even very sophisticated aggressors

00:33:58.875 --> 00:34:02.625
and they did it very badly and they kept all of them down.

00:34:02.667 --> 00:34:04.999
But doesn’t matter.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:13.000
Still, forgive them and try to be women.

00:34:13.208 --> 00:34:20.834
Very powerful. The powers of a woman are that of love,

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:27.625
which are the powers of God. And that is to be used

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:31.834
than to use other argumentative intellectualism, all nonsense.

00:34:32.709 --> 00:34:34.625
Don’t waste your energy with that.

00:34:34.999 --> 00:34:38.625
I would like, specially the Sahaja Yoginis of Germany,

00:34:40.083 --> 00:34:43.000
to become more and more ladylike.

00:34:43.959 --> 00:34:48.291
It doesn’t mean good cooking only but in the attitude towards life.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000
To think in a wider way

00:34:54.417 --> 00:34:58.333
that the whole Sahaja Yoga depends on our love capacity.

00:34:58.417 --> 00:35:02.125
We have to be extremely loving, extremely kind,

00:35:02.208 --> 00:35:05.667
looking after Sahaja Yogis,

00:35:07.999 --> 00:35:10.417
giving them all the joy that is possible.

00:35:13.291 --> 00:35:17.999
Otherwise in this country they can become like vampires.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.291
So be very careful and for men also I would say

00:35:23.333 --> 00:35:26.999
if there are women of that kind you must respect,

00:35:27.542 --> 00:35:32.000
you must give them all their privileges, look after them.

00:35:33.125 --> 00:35:35.834
They look after children but give them all the assistance,

00:35:35.917 --> 00:35:39.125
all the money that is needed by them.

00:35:40.291 --> 00:35:43.834
Do not ask for accounts and things, let them manage it.

00:35:43.999 --> 00:35:47.500
At the most you’ll become bankrupt, as it is you are.

00:35:51.834 --> 00:35:56.083
But first see what is their attitude towards Sahaja Yoga is.

00:35:56.125 --> 00:36:01.125
I’ve seen in the families where the women are in charge of the purse

00:36:01.208 --> 00:36:04.208
always we get much more money for Sahaja Yoga work

00:36:04.417 --> 00:36:08.000
than from the houses where the men are in control.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.542
It’s very surprising. When men are in control

00:36:12.625 --> 00:36:15.208
they have to think of their car,

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:18.917
they have to think of many big things,

00:36:18.999 --> 00:36:23.083
but when women are in control they know how to save money,

00:36:23.166 --> 00:36:25.500
as I have shown you how I have saved money.

00:36:25.583 --> 00:36:28.750
Men can never save. They can never save money.

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:32.542
Only the women can save but if they have a larger interest

00:36:32.625 --> 00:36:36.834
otherwise if they are self indulgent they’ll finish off all the money

00:36:36.917 --> 00:36:40.083
by going into the shop to buy a shirt for a man

00:36:40.208 --> 00:36:44.208
they’ll buy all saris for themselves. They can do like that.

00:36:45.291 --> 00:36:48.542
But if they have wider interests, if they have greater interest,

00:36:48.625 --> 00:36:53.208
they can use money so cleverly

00:36:53.291 --> 00:36:57.834
that they’ll have always money to spend for others. What do I do?

00:36:57.917 --> 00:37:00.291
What has, whatever my husband gives me to run the house –

00:37:00.417 --> 00:37:03.709
it’s quite a lot I should say – but I stinge on things,

00:37:03.792 --> 00:37:08.333
I go to the main markets, get things from there,

00:37:08.417 --> 00:37:11.709
try to save money on that, save here, save on my clothes.

00:37:11.834 --> 00:37:18.208
I, first time I have given my sweaters for dry cleaning in a good shop.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.834
That’s how a woman saves and then she spends for the general good.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000
Because that is her real satisfaction.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.959
If we develop that kind of a balanced view about our married life,

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.834
about our social life we’ll be ideal people in this world.

00:37:38.542 --> 00:37:41.959
About school also, I have said it, very clearly.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.125
Now if you want to hear about it

00:37:44.208 --> 00:37:46.999
I would request – have you got that pamphlet with you?

00:37:47.083 --> 00:37:49.834
Wanted to read it.

00:37:56.333 --> 00:38:03.917
Uh? No you don’t have. That’s just like men.

00:38:07.208 --> 00:38:10.750
They themselves said they would like to read it here you see.

00:38:16.542 --> 00:38:23.125
If you ask men to do the cooking everything will be missing. So,

00:38:24.625 --> 00:38:28.750
Shri Mataji, may I most respectfully ask you,

00:38:28.834 --> 00:38:32.917
is there any advantage at all in being a man?

00:38:46.208 --> 00:38:49.291
Without the man woman cannot express herself.

00:38:49.417 --> 00:38:53.625
She cannot express, because she is the potential.

00:38:54.834 --> 00:38:58.625
He is the kinetic. It’s absolutely relative terminology.

00:38:58.709 --> 00:39:02.834
You cannot, exist without a man, you cannot.

00:39:02.917 --> 00:39:06.709
Even if, supposing, if you have all the fragrance in the Mother Earth

00:39:06.834 --> 00:39:08.625
unless and until you have the flowers

00:39:08.709 --> 00:39:11.709
how will you know there is fragrance in Mother Earth?

00:39:14.291 --> 00:39:17.291
Men are most important otherwise what will they do?

00:39:17.333 --> 00:39:20.333
All their energy will be all rotten.

00:39:26.083 --> 00:39:29.500
So if women are the Mother Earth you are the flowers.

00:39:34.083 --> 00:39:39.709
Advantage what? You are the people who, ...everybody sees you.

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:49.750
Running around like Kartikeya.

00:39:55.333 --> 00:39:59.083
What can we do? You are like that.

00:39:59.917 --> 00:40:05.625
You cannot sit at home. You cannot even in the train,

00:40:05.709 --> 00:40:09.542
if you are going, you’ll find as soon as the train will stop

00:40:09.625 --> 00:40:12.999
all the men will get out of the train. They can’t sit there.

00:40:18.625 --> 00:40:22.709
Like, I told my husband:

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:25.834
“What is this all the time you are running out of the house?

00:40:25.999 --> 00:40:28.417
Why can't you sit in the house for some time? You must sit.

00:40:28.625 --> 00:40:33.291
So he said: "No, in our side if any man, sits in the house

00:40:33.333 --> 00:40:34.834
he’s called as ghargusana",

00:40:34.917 --> 00:40:37.750
means 'who is all the time in the house', you see.

00:40:37.834 --> 00:40:39.333
And I said: “What do they call to man

00:40:39.417 --> 00:40:41.125
who always runs away from the house gharbhagna

00:40:41.208 --> 00:40:43.917
Means 'the run, runner away, who runs away'.

00:40:43.999 --> 00:40:45.709
There should be something in between.

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:47.834
But that’s manly, it’s all right.

00:40:47.875 --> 00:40:50.959
But we can, with Sahaja Yoga, what we can do

00:40:50.999 --> 00:40:54.834
is to form a little balance between both the things.

00:40:57.709 --> 00:41:00.917
That is what Sahaja Yoga is, that it gives a balance.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.542
Then you start be…enjoying each other’s company so much

00:41:04.625 --> 00:41:08.000
that even in the house you enjoy, outside also enjoy.

00:41:08.208 --> 00:41:12.291
So you can be together in the house, also outside.

00:41:13.959 --> 00:41:18.208
The interests are the same because the interest becomes the same.

00:41:20.083 --> 00:41:23.959
Like the flowers who fall on the Mother Earth

00:41:25.083 --> 00:41:27.000
make the Mother Earth fragrant

00:41:27.208 --> 00:41:29.917
and then we can say that Mother Earth is fragrant.

00:41:31.542 --> 00:41:37.000
As beautiful as that. Alright.

00:41:38.208 --> 00:41:41.083
So for education I’ve already given instructions

00:41:42.083 --> 00:41:43.834
and I’ve already talked about it

00:41:43.875 --> 00:41:47.542
that we are not to make a big ado out of this Maria Montessori

00:41:47.583 --> 00:41:52.834
and this and that. We are going to have Sahaja Yoga schools.

00:41:52.917 --> 00:41:55.333
All nonsense, because I have seen

00:41:55.417 --> 00:41:57.000
those who are teaching in Maria Montessori style,

00:41:57.208 --> 00:41:59.834
the women have become horrible.

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:06.083
Was amazed the amount of ego they have developed in themselves.

00:42:07.291 --> 00:42:10.625
So you become Sahaja Yoga teachers

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.125
and it’s going to be a Sahaja Yoga school.

00:42:13.208 --> 00:42:21.125
In, Sydney or in Melbourne,

00:42:21.208 --> 00:42:24.750
we started the school in Melbourne very nicely

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.208
and now they are going to have it in Sydney the same way.

00:42:28.542 --> 00:42:31.959
And openly it is a Sahaja Yoga school, there’s no fear about it.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.625
Openly it’s a Sahaja Yoga school,

00:42:34.834 --> 00:42:38.333
and then people have achieved so much out of it.

00:42:39.083 --> 00:42:41.750
We, why should we take any garb like that?

00:42:41.834 --> 00:42:44.834
We should go all out to say its a Sahaja Yoga school.

00:42:44.917 --> 00:42:48.000
So you, the teachers, also become experts in Sahaja Yoga,

00:42:48.417 --> 00:42:53.333
so they have to be good Sahaja Yogis, Yoginis or Sahaja Yogis.

00:42:53.417 --> 00:42:56.959
They should not be egoistical, there should be no ego in them,

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:57.917
they should not be catching,

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.500
anybody who’s catching is not a good teacher for Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:00.542 --> 00:43:05.291
It’s not like in a Maria Montessori school

00:43:05.333 --> 00:43:07.917
that in the night the teacher drinks, smokes

00:43:07.959 --> 00:43:10.500
and morning time she’s a Maria Montessori teacher.

00:43:11.291 --> 00:43:13.291
Here you have to be a Sahaja Yogini first

00:43:13.333 --> 00:43:17.083
and then only you can teach in a Sahaja Yoga school.

00:43:18.333 --> 00:43:21.417
You have to have that quality, that is very important,

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:25.208
as it is important that we should get students who are Realized Souls

00:43:25.291 --> 00:43:27.083
or who can get Realization.

00:43:29.333 --> 00:43:35.083
Alright, so today’s puja is specially for Kartikeya.

00:43:36.542 --> 00:43:53.709
Kartikeya represents the great, we can say the captor or leader of all the ganas,

00:43:55.125 --> 00:44:01.000
of all the, like a Commander-in-Chief.

00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:07.208
Ganesha is the King but He is the Commander-in-Chief

00:44:07.291 --> 00:44:14.625
and because German character is to be in command of everything

00:44:14.999 --> 00:44:18.959
we are going to have this puja

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.500
where the men will be in command of their spirits

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.750
and their manly qualities

00:44:28.542 --> 00:44:32.500
and women will be in command of their womanly qualities.

00:44:33.542 --> 00:44:38.959
To be in command is different from to be a master.

00:44:40.291 --> 00:44:43.917
Master owns it, a commander does not own it.

00:44:46.291 --> 00:44:50.917
He does not own it, that is also lost.

00:44:51.625 --> 00:44:54.959
Possession is also lost, we just command it.

00:44:57.125 --> 00:44:59.959
And that is the state we have to come to now,

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:07.417
from Ganesha state to the state of Kartikeya.

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:08.917
The other way round.

00:45:08.959 --> 00:45:11.208
Ganesha is nice, he’s the King,

00:45:11.291 --> 00:45:16.999
very nicely sitting down with all the powers, alright?

00:45:17.125 --> 00:45:20.500
Innocence is there,

00:45:20.542 --> 00:45:27.709
but Kartikeya’s the one who commands innocence,

00:45:29.542 --> 00:45:32.750
gives you a power of that commandment.

00:45:35.458 --> 00:45:38.291
He commands. After the Guru Puja

00:45:38.417 --> 00:45:42.625
it's better that we should have the power to command others

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:50.417
and that commanding spirit comes in the men

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:55.999
through their talking, through their dynamism,

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.208
through their personal achievements;

00:45:59.291 --> 00:46:03.500
for the women through their loving power,

00:46:03.583 --> 00:46:09.125
through their forbearance, through their gracious behaviour,

00:46:10.542 --> 00:46:13.208
forgiveness, compassion.

00:46:13.417 --> 00:46:18.625
So let us develop that today, that we can command it,

00:46:18.834 --> 00:46:21.792
means it’s not that what we have

00:46:21.834 --> 00:46:24.417
but in a position we are to command.

00:46:25.208 --> 00:46:28.709
I hope you understand what is Kartikeya.

00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:31.125
May God Bless You.

00:46:34.542 --> 00:46:37.458
So let us start the Puja.

00:46:49.999 --> 00:46:55.291
Who made this? You made it - this Ganesha?

00:46:55.417 --> 00:46:57.917
Such a sweet thing.

00:47:01.417 --> 00:47:06.834
You are very good, I must say. May God bless you!

00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:17.333
Get some German people to do it also.

00:47:29.999 --> 00:47:33.417
Let us have some more people here from Germany.

00:47:34.999 --> 00:47:37.792
Ladies also, of course.

00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:01.140
The one who has made Ganesha - is she German too?

00:52:04.276 --> 00:52:08.400
This one also should wash.

00:52:19.567 --> 00:52:23.401
All those who wrote letters for Me to come to Germany

00:52:23.526 --> 00:52:26.193
should come to wash My feet.

00:52:26.442 --> 00:52:30.151
May God bless you! May God bless you! Thank you!

00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:39.235
Take out that one from inside. Now take that out. There is no need.

01:06:50.416 --> 01:06:52.124
We call her Kamala, Kamala.

01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:55.041
Kamala is the name of the goddess, all right?

01:06:55.208 --> 01:07:03.707
Kamal Lakshmi. Kamala. May God bless you.

01:07:22.375 --> 01:07:27.124
We can have a singing little bit, because there are two ladies more.

01:07:29.375 --> 01:07:33.208
And Hugo still has to do it.

01:07:44.999 --> 01:07:47.749
Good.

01:08:08.541 --> 01:08:11.541
That's it.

01:08:14.541 --> 01:08:16.541
May God bless you.

01:08:20.541 --> 01:08:23.375
Come to the other side.

01:08:24.541 --> 01:08:28.458
Who are the ladies now? There are some more ladies? Finished?

01:08:43.541 --> 01:08:45.541
Good.

01:10:43.541 --> 01:10:47.624
Use the same water

01:11:47.958 --> 01:11:52.208
They can use the same water, because too much water already there.

01:16:25.673 --> 01:16:29.923
Now we can say the one thousand names of Kartikeya.

01:16:31.298 --> 01:16:35.673
No, 108.

01:16:38.756 --> 01:16:43.673
I thought 1000 would be good idea, but let it be 108.

01:16:48.672 --> 01:16:51.507
Let`s see how it works out with 108.

01:16:53.672 --> 01:16:55.839
Say it loudly.

01:17:46.090 --> 01:17:48.964
Say it loudly, it's not clear.

01:17:55.672 --> 01:17:57.881
No, not yet. Get him another one,

01:17:58.507 --> 01:18:00.298
let him have one more,

01:18:00.423 --> 01:18:03.673
because must be clearly, otherwise it has no meaning.

01:43:09.828 --> 01:43:13.786
In these 108 names, if you have noticed,

01:43:15.203 --> 01:43:21.869
they have shown that Kartikeya is the innocence

01:43:22.245 --> 01:43:26.953
that is acting on the right hand side, in the Pingala.

01:43:27.245 --> 01:43:32.411
and that is also - it is very much related to Prana.

01:43:32.828 --> 01:43:38.619
It gives you Prana. Prana is the vital breath that we take

01:43:38.744 --> 01:43:41.577
- breathe in and breathe out.

01:43:41.828 --> 01:43:43.786
so it is related to the right side.

01:43:43.911 --> 01:43:48.245
Then also it is related to eternity - Anantari.

01:43:48.410 --> 01:43:53.245
Anantar is the snake, the Shesha.

01:43:53.410 --> 01:43:56.869
which is the brother of Vishnu.

01:43:57.036 --> 01:44:02.410
So it is He who is represented here as Kartikeya.

01:44:02.411 --> 01:44:04.828
He is called as Anantar.

01:44:04.911 --> 01:44:06.786
So he is the fire.

01:44:07.411 --> 01:44:13.994
He is the one who ignites within you the capacity

01:44:14.078 --> 01:44:16.411
to consume the force,

01:44:17.411 --> 01:44:22.411
also the capacity to command the people

01:44:22.828 --> 01:44:32.161
and also the capacity to be a person full of brilliance.

01:44:32.286 --> 01:44:36.328
You see, an innocent person could be very brilliant.

01:44:36.410 --> 01:44:43.203
All these capacities are expressed in Kartikeya's Swarupa

01:44:43.286 --> 01:44:45.411
in his state.

01:44:45.619 --> 01:44:49.411
Today by worshipping Kartikeya we have to know,

01:44:49.828 --> 01:44:53.661
that Kartikeya is now awakened within us.

01:44:54.410 --> 01:45:00.410
And with that capacity we have to fight.

01:45:00.619 --> 01:45:02.411
Ultimately He is the Nishkalanka.

01:45:02.619 --> 01:45:04.828
He is the one who is the fighter.

01:45:04.911 --> 01:45:09.410
So from Ganesha to Christ to Nishkalanka.

01:45:09.619 --> 01:45:11.619
These are the three stages

01:45:11.702 --> 01:45:14.619
into which the innocence has gone.

01:45:14.702 --> 01:45:23.245
From Ganesha to Kartikeya and now to Christ.

01:45:23.410 --> 01:45:26.619
And from Christ to Nishkalanka.

01:45:26.828 --> 01:45:30.245
In the form of Nishkalanka He is innocent.

01:45:30.328 --> 01:45:33.619
so there is no Kalanka, there is no spot on Him, nothing.

01:45:33.702 --> 01:45:35.828
He is absolutely clean, immaculate.

01:45:35.911 --> 01:45:38.410
Plus He is fiery.

01:45:39.411 --> 01:45:42.911
Plus He has all the qualities of Ekadesha Rudra.

01:45:42.994 --> 01:45:47.120
Means the eleven qualities or the forces of Shiva

01:45:47.203 --> 01:45:49.120
which can kill..

01:45:49.410 --> 01:45:55.120
So He has a capacity to kill and destroy that is evil,

01:45:55.286 --> 01:46:02.410
and to give blessings and courage to His followers.

01:46:04.036 --> 01:46:07.786
This is the last incarnation, which is called Kalaki.

01:46:07.911 --> 01:46:11.577
In normal words you call it Kalaki, is actually Nishkalanka.

01:46:11.661 --> 01:46:13.411
Is the white horse.

01:46:13.536 --> 01:46:18.619
So it is the Kartikeya who sits on the white horse.

01:46:18.828 --> 01:46:22.410
So how innocence grows within you now

01:46:22.411 --> 01:46:26.828
is up to the point of Kartikeya.

01:46:26.953 --> 01:46:30.410
This has been today done on this land,

01:46:30.411 --> 01:46:32.410
Deutschland as you call it,

01:46:32.411 --> 01:46:37.245
where Kartikeya is to be born within you, to be awakened within you.

01:46:37.410 --> 01:46:39.411
May God bless you!

01:46:55.619 --> 01:46:58.411
Now if you want you can sing some songs

01:46:58.619 --> 01:47:01.410
as "Ya Devi Sarva Buteshu", which one you like.

01:47:01.494 --> 01:47:04.828
I would like to have ladies here, seven married ladies

01:47:10.036 --> 01:47:11.828
just to help me out.

01:47:11.911 --> 01:47:16.828
First we'll have little girls if there are in here.

01:47:16.911 --> 01:47:19.036
The little girls have to come up.

01:47:22.410 --> 01:47:25.452
Little later, when you have to garland Me, all right?

01:47:25.536 --> 01:47:28.410
Now the girls have to come.

01:47:28.411 --> 01:47:31.828
Where are the girls? All the girls have to come.

01:47:31.911 --> 01:47:33.828
Who are all the other girls who are here?

01:47:35.411 --> 01:47:40.828
All right. Come along. Right, come on.

01:47:43.411 --> 01:47:45.410
You also come along, both of you.

01:47:45.411 --> 01:47:49.411
All right, you also come, both of you.

01:47:59.828 --> 01:48:01.911
Sit down. Sit down.

01:48:03.036 --> 01:48:09.245
If there is any unmarried girl, big unmarried girl - please come.

01:48:18.410 --> 01:48:21.036
Somebody who is not yet married.

01:48:22.411 --> 01:48:26.410
Someone - come.

01:48:35.411 --> 01:48:38.120
Remove this one, I think. Ask somebody to remove this.

01:49:40.828 --> 01:49:45.203
Gregoire: "Shri Mataji, first before we sing the hynm to the Goddess

01:49:45.328 --> 01:49:51.328
we would like to read to You an amended version of the Lord's Prayer."

01:49:55.410 --> 01:49:56.619
Our Mother

01:49:56.828 --> 01:49:58.411
Who art on earth

01:49:58.619 --> 01:50:01.120
Hallowed be Thy name

01:50:01.410 --> 01:50:03.744
Thy kingdom come

01:50:03.911 --> 01:50:05.911
Thy will be done

01:50:06.036 --> 01:50:09.286
On earth as it is in heaven

01:50:09.411 --> 01:50:13.619
Give us this day Your divine vibrations

01:50:13.828 --> 01:50:14.619
And forgive us our trespasses

01:50:19.036 --> 01:50:20.245
As we forgive those

01:50:20.245 --> 01:50:22.619
Who trespass against us

01:50:22.619 --> 01:50:25.036
And lead us not into maya

01:50:25.619 --> 01:50:28.036
But deliver us from evil

01:50:28.036 --> 01:50:29.828
For Thine is the Father

01:50:30.411 --> 01:50:32.245
The children and the glory

01:50:32.245 --> 01:50:37.036
Forever and ever. Amen."

01:50:51.411 --> 01:50:55.619
So very sweet.
