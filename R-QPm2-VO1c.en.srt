00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,434
1991-09-01 Shri Krishna puja - The technique of the play, Cabella, Italy

2
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:40,234
Today, we have decided to worship the Yogeshwara.

3
00:03:41,534 --> 00:03:48,434
I think that is the greatest name of Shri Krishna for us.

4
00:03:49,334 --> 00:03:54,334
That means He is the Ishwara of yoga.

5
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,167
Yoga means the union, as you know, with the divine.

6
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:05,267
But also yoga has another meaning which means yukti.

7
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:10,167
In English language to translate it properly is not possible.

8
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:17,033
We can call it as... Yukti means the trick.

9
00:04:17,334 --> 00:04:26,167
But trick is always connected with something funny and bad.

10
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:31,400
But this 'yukti' means the technique. But 'technique' is mechanical.

11
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:35,067
So I couldn't find any proper word for 'yukti'.

12
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:43,000
But one can say it is: to know the technique and the trick of the technique

13
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:49,067
is also another meaning of yoga - yukti.

14
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,067
So, even if you are connected, if you do not know the trick of the union

15
00:04:55,534 --> 00:05:02,067
then it is useless, it is of no avail.

16
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:10,434
So what one has to learn, after getting realization, is

17
00:05:11,234 --> 00:05:15,067
not only the technique but the trick of the technique.

18
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,100
At Krishna's level when we reach

19
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:25,067
- it is an incarnation after Shri Rama's.

20
00:05:26,234 --> 00:05:32,300
So Shri Rama came as a 'Maryada Purushottama', which means

21
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:47,067
a person who is a complete ideal of maryadas and a benevolent king.

22
00:05:48,534 --> 00:05:56,067
But in the case of Shri Krishna it was a different phase

23
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,334
because people had become extremely serious, very disciplined,

24
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:08,067
and were leading a life which was, we can say, over-dharmic.

25
00:06:10,267 --> 00:06:19,534
And this had put the people at a level, fixed,

26
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,234
and they thought that "If we are doing all these things every day

27
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:27,567
then it's alright. We have reached the last."

28
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:31,100
So Shri Krishna had to come -

29
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:34,567
Himself, Shri Vishnu, came as Shri Krishna -

30
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:44,067
to tell us about the ascent, and that - all this is just a play.

31
00:06:49,167 --> 00:06:55,534
But only a person who is a master of the play can do the play.

32
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,067
So to know the play. Supposing you have communication,

33
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:06,067
you have electrical communications.

34
00:07:06,434 --> 00:07:11,434
Now you don't know how to play with it - play.

35
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:16,500
Not how to know or how to connect but to play.

36
00:07:17,133 --> 00:07:21,067
Supposing only you know all the technique,

37
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,067
then it becomes quite a headache,

38
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:30,067
because all the time you think you are doing it.

39
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:33,434
You have to do this and, this is to be done, that has to be done,

40
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:39,067
and this connection is not all right; that should be properly connected.

41
00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:42,200
You get tired and bored.

42
00:07:43,234 --> 00:07:50,200
But if it's a play for you, just a play. For any master it's a play.

43
00:07:51,334 --> 00:07:57,067
If it's just a play for you, then you don't feel tired - it's fun.

44
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,067
And that is what is Leela, that's why He is called 'Leeladhara' -

45
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:11,067
because He is a master. He came as a master, master not as a guru,

46
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:20,067
but master of all the arts of this yoga, yukti.

47
00:08:23,267 --> 00:08:33,067
So He's so deft, He's so capable, that for Him it's a play.

48
00:08:34,534 --> 00:08:40,334
All this is a play for Him. And this is what one has to know,

49
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:47,067
that, in yoga, everything that you do should be just a play.

50
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:54,067
Say, getting up at 5 o'clock in the morning, should be a play.

51
00:08:57,467 --> 00:08:59,500
In the morning you get up.

52
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:06,334
The sun has not yet come, to suggest what you have to do,

53
00:09:07,234 --> 00:09:12,400
and the moon has departed, and in that twilight

54
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,067
or a little darkness if you get up, it's very beautiful.

55
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:24,033
And at that time you sit down for your dhyaan.

56
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:32,033
But it's not a serious thing, it's not something that is boring, it's a play.

57
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,300
But for that you have to be a master.

58
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:44,067
If you are the master of yoga, then it's a play.

59
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:47,334
So first Shri Rama's state has to be there

60
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:53,067
where you become really a Vishwa Nirmala Dharmi

61
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:59,067
so that it becomes your play.

62
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:09,067
Now communication with the Divine has to go to the whole world.

63
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:18,300
The whole world has to get this communication that you have received.

64
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:22,300
For this part Shri Krishna arranged something

65
00:10:23,033 --> 00:10:28,467
in His lifetime in a very simple way, as a child.

66
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:34,067
It looks, very childlike.

67
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:41,067
Like when the Gopi's were taking their baths He hid their clothes -

68
00:10:41,334 --> 00:10:44,500
I mean, Indian women are never fully nude, never -

69
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:50,033
He hid their saris and all that and He could see their back,

70
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:54,067
this little boy. What is for a little boy?

71
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
He's sitting on a tree and is trying to raise their Kundalini.

72
00:11:02,234 --> 00:11:08,067
They're coming out of the river Jamuna which is being vibrated by Radha.

73
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:13,067
Already there are vibrations, you see - raising their Kundalini.

74
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:24,133
Then they are taking the water and He breaks their pitchers, from the back,

75
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,000
which have also got vibrated water in.

76
00:11:29,133 --> 00:11:33,133
So the vibrated water falls on the backs of these ladies and

77
00:11:34,267 --> 00:11:38,267
He tries to awaken their Kundalini.

78
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,467
See the play of a child,

79
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:50,067
how He tried to play in His childhood, just like a child.

80
00:11:51,267 --> 00:11:59,067
And then He shows, later on, His child-like expertise

81
00:12:00,534 --> 00:12:05,500
in dealing with politics, with people, with communication and everything.

82
00:12:08,367 --> 00:12:11,300
And His power was Radha, Radha 'Ra' 'dha' .

83
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:15,267
'Ra' means energy, 'Dha' means the one which sustains 'Ra-dha'.

84
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:19,500
So the "Dha Re Di Sa Dharmaha"  as they say.

85
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:25,067
In the same way Radha 'Ra' 'Dha' - the one who sustains the energy.

86
00:12:26,234 --> 00:12:32,367
So the first quality that He got from Her is - She's the 'Alaahda Dayini'.

87
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,234
I couldn't find a word in English for 'Alaahd'.

88
00:12:38,534 --> 00:12:44,300
'Alaahd' is when you suddenly see something nice and joy starts.

89
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,300
Just feel very happy.

90
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:50,067
I mean, there are very few words in English, as you know,

91
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:59,067
for joy or at the most happiness.

92
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:03,133
But 'Alaahd' is a kind of a joy which,

93
00:13:03,334 --> 00:13:09,067
as you get the fresh air - then how you feel.

94
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:12,067
That is Alaahd. So She is 'Alaahda Dayini'.

95
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:15,067
She's the one who is the giver of Alaahd.

96
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:22,334
And so with Her powers, He could work out this Alaahd

97
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:26,133
to all the people with whom He was connected.

98
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:32,067
So all the Gopas and Gopis who were with Him had to do Rasa.

99
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:35,067
'Ra' is 'energy', 'Sa' means 'with'.

100
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,033
To dance with the energy that is Radhaji.

101
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:44,200
He used to just play the flute and She used to dance,

102
00:13:44,467 --> 00:13:49,234
the energy used to pass through Her hands to all the other people

103
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,067
and the Kundalini would be awakened.

104
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,000
So this was another play that He had.

105
00:13:58,167 --> 00:14:02,067
So in the play only He raised the Kundalini.

106
00:14:05,067 --> 00:14:08,267
But in modern times it's very difficult,

107
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:15,033
it is not easy to raise Kundalinis in modern times in that way.

108
00:14:15,367 --> 00:14:23,334
I mean, nobody will understand also.

109
00:14:26,234 --> 00:14:33,067
So in modern times when Sahaja Yoga is not just raising the Kundalini

110
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,400
but giving the complete knowledge about Sahaja Yoga

111
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,234
and also empowering the person with

112
00:14:41,534 --> 00:14:46,367
the power to give others realization, it was tremendous task.

113
00:14:48,033 --> 00:14:50,567
And that's why we had to find out these methods

114
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:55,067
by which we could give realization to people.

115
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:04,033
In those days Kundalinis were awakened but the Sahasrara was not broken.

116
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:07,067
So Kundalini must be somewhere hanging in the Agnya,

117
00:15:07,067 --> 00:15:11,033
maybe at heart, maybe somewhere.

118
00:15:11,267 --> 00:15:18,067
And such people became the seekers and that's how we find,

119
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:24,334
today, people are here as Sahaja Yogis whose Sahasrara's are open

120
00:15:24,334 --> 00:15:28,367
and they know all the yukti of Sahaja Yoga.

121
00:15:30,033 --> 00:15:37,200
But there are subtler and subtler yuktis of Sahaja Yoga which you have to master.

122
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:46,133
The first is that His character was 'madhuriya', meaning the sweetness.

123
00:15:47,434 --> 00:15:54,067
Sweetness. We always say, "He's sweet like honey".

124
00:15:56,434 --> 00:16:03,067
So when He talked to anyone or He communicated with anyone,

125
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:13,067
it was through sweetness; and this communication,

126
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:20,067
if you have not developed, then you are nowhere near Yoga.

127
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:27,400
To talk to someone sweetly, automatically.

128
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:34,033
Everything is madhuriya for Him, His talking,

129
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:42,067
His actions, His face. Everything is madhuriya.

130
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:49,067
So when we talk of communications first of all the greatest thing is

131
00:16:49,067 --> 00:16:52,267
the communication between human beings

132
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:58,167
and when we have to think of the communication with the human beings

133
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:03,067
many people think that by aggression you will communicate better,

134
00:17:04,267 --> 00:17:06,267
which is not true.

135
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:12,334
I mean if somebody wants to get something out of someone, say;

136
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:20,067
so you go there and just talk, "I have to have! How can you do it?

137
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:24,234
This, that!" As it is - it's no good.

138
00:17:26,267 --> 00:17:32,000
But if you are sweet and start talking sweetly

139
00:17:32,334 --> 00:17:38,067
then 99% will definitely dissolve.

140
00:17:39,334 --> 00:17:46,067
So to dissolve people with sweetness - how to do it -

141
00:17:46,267 --> 00:17:50,267
that trick one has to learn:

142
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,500
how, with sweetness, you can dissolve people.

143
00:17:59,267 --> 00:18:02,334
This is one of His special qualities,

144
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:09,400
that you talk to someone in such a manner, genuinely,

145
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,067
in a very sweet manner, and

146
00:18:16,267 --> 00:18:23,300
the problem between you and that person will be dissolved, absolutely.

147
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,067
Now there are many tricks

148
00:18:27,534 --> 00:18:34,067
and how to talk to someone is one of the biggest things one has to learn.

149
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:38,267
First of all you must always show

150
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,067
that you are less intelligent than another person.

151
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,300
Like if I'm talking to a scientist I will say,

152
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:54,067
"I'm sorry I don't know any science you know.

153
00:18:55,234 --> 00:19:02,067
I'm no good for a scientist." So they feel "ahhhh, very good."

154
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,400
If you have to talk to some musician, you must say "I don't know any music.

155
00:19:15,334 --> 00:19:21,067
No, I just have learned a little bit, but not much."

156
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
Musician feels very happy.

157
00:19:24,434 --> 00:19:29,067
You may call it a pampering of the ego. You may call it [that].

158
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:36,067
But there's no harm in saying that "I'm nothing to compared to you".

159
00:19:39,067 --> 00:19:45,067
So the first trick is complete humility when you talk to another person.

160
00:19:47,067 --> 00:19:51,267
It's the sign of greatness, it's the sign of fulfilment.

161
00:19:51,334 --> 00:19:57,067
As the trees, when they are laden with fruits they bend down.

162
00:20:00,334 --> 00:20:07,467
So, first of all, if you say "I am no one. I don't understand anything

163
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:13,067
but I would like to hear" this is first.

164
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:17,400
The first quality of communication is to be

165
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,400
extremely humble about yourself.

166
00:20:20,067 --> 00:20:24,067
The other person should not know who you are.

167
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,067
And there's a lot of fun in it.

168
00:20:31,067 --> 00:20:37,100
Say for example now - I can say about Myself

169
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,400
that My husband was very highly placed in India.

170
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:47,067
But I met a friend in Delhi - she was studying with Me in school

171
00:20:47,267 --> 00:20:52,067
and in college - and She asked Me "where do you live?"

172
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:54,067
So, I told her, "In Meenabagh," which was

173
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:58,000
just a useless, small, little place

174
00:20:58,033 --> 00:21:01,067
meant for very ordinary officers because they had

175
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:05,234
not allotted us any house or anything so, temporarily, we were there.

176
00:21:05,467 --> 00:21:07,234
She said "what? What is your husband doing?"

177
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:11,234
I said "He's some government servant." I didn't tell her [his position]!

178
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:19,133
He came down, so he just looked at Me and he smiled.

179
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:22,067
She said "do you know him?" I said "He's My husband".

180
00:21:22,267 --> 00:21:26,200
She was shocked, "He's your husband? Oh my God!

181
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:30,033
Why didn't you tell me?" Immediately the whole thing changed

182
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,300
and she felt so ashamed of herself.

183
00:21:32,467 --> 00:21:35,067
She had started looking down upon Me,

184
00:21:35,067 --> 00:21:38,067
"Ah, Married to some clerk or someone."

185
00:21:43,234 --> 00:21:51,067
So the best thing is to play down. Play down everything.

186
00:21:52,234 --> 00:21:54,200
Now I know of certain Sahaja Yogis they say,

187
00:21:54,234 --> 00:21:59,067
"oh Mother has giving me such powers. I can do this, I can do that."

188
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,067
This boastfullness is of no use.

189
00:22:02,534 --> 00:22:06,567
"I haven't got any powers you see. I'm just a Sahaja Yogi that's all.

190
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:10,067
But if you want I can try."

191
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:24,434
So play down as much as you can. Practice this at home,

192
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:29,067
first practice and then do it.

193
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:36,000
So that is one of the greatest qualities of communication with others.

194
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,100
Second thing: I think in the whole of Gita, if you read it,

195
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:43,334
there's one is very important thing.

196
00:22:43,334 --> 00:22:46,167
He says "krodho'bhijaayate sammohah"  (Gita 2:61)].

197
00:22:46,334 --> 00:22:51,167
You see among all the worst things that we have -

198
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,067
according to Him we have six enemies.

199
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,200
But in Gita He started with 'Krodha'.

200
00:23:02,467 --> 00:23:06,067
He said - it starts with Krodha, means anger.

201
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:14,434
If you have anger within you then you are not a master at all.

202
00:23:15,434 --> 00:23:21,067
There's no need for a master to get angry because he can play about.

203
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,234
He can make you dance like this.

204
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,067
What is the need to lose your temper?

205
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,400
But that mastery if you don't have, of handling people,

206
00:23:34,234 --> 00:23:38,434
then after five/six minutes of talk your voice starts raising

207
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:43,400
and something starts barking,

208
00:23:46,067 --> 00:23:49,234
because that temper is still inside you, burning.

209
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:56,000
But for a master there should be no temper - no need.

210
00:23:58,467 --> 00:24:03,500
He has started with Krodha, that: with the Krodha all problems start.

211
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,067
from one to another to another to another.

212
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,400
So we should watch out if we are angry people.

213
00:24:15,234 --> 00:24:22,367
Anger comes from Vishuddhi. Starts from liver - Vishnu -

214
00:24:23,033 --> 00:24:25,167
but is expressed through Vishuddhi.

215
00:24:25,567 --> 00:24:29,067
The face becomes red, eyes become red.

216
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:34,300
From the mouth you start saying all kinds of horrible things

217
00:24:35,067 --> 00:24:39,500
and the whole expression becomes so different when you are angry.

218
00:24:40,234 --> 00:24:46,067
So this anger is to be seen, "Where is it within us? Where is it this anger?

219
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,200
Liver? alright, I'll put it right."

220
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,467
So to master it you have to face yourself clearly.

221
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,067
Many people I have seen people say

222
00:24:57,067 --> 00:24:59,334
"Mother you know this lady is such a hot tempered women,

223
00:24:59,334 --> 00:25:02,434
she is so dominating. She does this, she does that."

224
00:25:03,067 --> 00:25:05,267
But if you tell her she says, "No no, I don't do that way.

225
00:25:05,267 --> 00:25:07,334
No, no I'm very good."

226
00:25:08,334 --> 00:25:14,067
"But how other's saying that?", "I don't know but I'm very good" - finished!

227
00:25:15,133 --> 00:25:18,067
If somebody is saying that then you watch yourself -

228
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:25,067
do you get into tempers or not? Are you loosing your temper?

229
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:28,067
It's very easy to make it out then face it.

230
00:25:29,067 --> 00:25:32,067
So the trick of the trade is to face yourself

231
00:25:32,067 --> 00:25:36,234
and see for yourself how much you are lacking.

232
00:25:38,267 --> 00:25:42,267
So first is humility, which should be genuine,

233
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:50,400
and secondly is equanimity - no temper.

234
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,067
There is no need to take to temper.

235
00:25:53,067 --> 00:25:56,234
At the most you can say "What are you doing?

236
00:25:57,067 --> 00:25:58,567
Why are you doing that way?"

237
00:25:59,033 --> 00:26:02,067
Now if you do something, you know, maybe something I might say which

238
00:26:02,067 --> 00:26:04,067
I would not like, so I don't want to say."

239
00:26:04,067 --> 00:26:11,067
Like that - at the most! Up to that point is alright;

240
00:26:11,067 --> 00:26:16,067
that you should say that, "I dislike it", but not to go further with it.

241
00:26:19,534 --> 00:26:23,334
If you just stop at a point,

242
00:26:26,067 --> 00:26:30,067
then this habit of getting into temper will go away.

243
00:26:30,167 --> 00:26:33,334
This arrogance will go away, which has to go.

244
00:26:33,567 --> 00:26:37,067
This arrogance has to go, this temper has to go.

245
00:26:37,267 --> 00:26:41,067
And then, you'll be surprised, you will feel very much relieved.

246
00:26:41,334 --> 00:26:45,334
Because this anger, once it comes in, reacts,

247
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:50,467
and catches your left Vishuddi, and you become guilty,

248
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:55,067
you feel very bad - "Why I said so, I should not have said this."

249
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:02,167
So Vishuddi's finished, left Vishuddhi, means - it's a headache.

250
00:27:03,067 --> 00:27:06,534
It goes on accumulating like a store house there - all your anger,

251
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,200
temper whatever you have - and this left Vishuddhi catches,

252
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,167
and you know the problems of left Vishuddhi.

253
00:27:17,067 --> 00:27:23,000
So if you get angry with someone, don't feel guilty

254
00:27:23,567 --> 00:27:28,067
but go before the mirror and slap yourself nicely, twice.

255
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,067
Now you get angry with yourself, "let me get angry!"

256
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:35,067
Then stand before the mirror, "shoo shoo shoo" like that

257
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:43,234
In the same manner as you get angry try to act,

258
00:27:44,467 --> 00:27:46,467
you'll never feel guilty.

259
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,067
Or maybe more angry - would be better.

260
00:27:50,334 --> 00:27:53,000
So you empty out your left Vishuddhi.

261
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,267
Next time you won't do it.

262
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,400
But feeling guilty means you will repeat and repeat the same thing.

263
00:28:03,167 --> 00:28:09,400
So this temper is expressed by men and women differently.

264
00:28:11,033 --> 00:28:12,067
And I'm very much worried about

265
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:17,067
the women sometimes because they take to water power - then I'm lost.

266
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,367
But those who have ego too much, cry much more. That's the sign.

267
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:28,067
I've seen. If you say anything to them immediately they start crying,

268
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:35,133
because already the left Vishuddhi is there, full, like a full balloon

269
00:28:35,267 --> 00:28:39,033
and when you touch them it becomes water.

270
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:46,334
But men, their temper is a different style, as you know very well,

271
00:28:47,067 --> 00:28:50,300
that: when they get angry they might fight with each other,

272
00:28:50,467 --> 00:28:56,067
box everyone and then settle down nicely and have something to drink.

273
00:28:59,334 --> 00:29:01,500
"Let us have it out!" you see, they'll say. Take out.

274
00:29:02,067 --> 00:29:04,534
But women don't, they keep it there

275
00:29:05,067 --> 00:29:09,400
and once they keep it then it becomes tears, it starts coming down.

276
00:29:09,567 --> 00:29:14,534
So, if these are just tears out of joy, happiness, that's different,

277
00:29:15,234 --> 00:29:19,133
or out of feelings for others - but it is not that,

278
00:29:19,267 --> 00:29:23,067
but it's tears just to impress another person that

279
00:29:23,067 --> 00:29:26,067
you are very sad or something.

280
00:29:36,334 --> 00:29:42,100
So the second trick is how to master your own temper

281
00:29:42,434 --> 00:29:46,067
and the third one is how to master

282
00:29:46,067 --> 00:29:53,067
the temper of others - that's even better.

283
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,000
I don't know if I have told you the trick of

284
00:29:58,067 --> 00:30:01,067
Gagangan Maharaj, when I went to him.

285
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,000
He is a very hot tempered avadhuta, sitting on

286
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,067
a tiger, and he's lost his legs, because he was feeling hot

287
00:30:07,234 --> 00:30:09,067
so he was sitting in the water

288
00:30:09,067 --> 00:30:14,434
all the time, so his feet are useless and he goes on a tiger, they say.

289
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,000
I never saw the tiger, of course.

290
00:30:17,033 --> 00:30:20,300
But he knows about Me and all that and he told everyone about Me

291
00:30:20,334 --> 00:30:22,300
so I went to see him.

292
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:28,067
And he's supposed to control the rain. It was quite a steep climb

293
00:30:28,067 --> 00:30:31,100
for about one and a half hours.

294
00:30:31,467 --> 00:30:35,033
And as soon as I stepped in, it started raining, raining,

295
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:38,300
raining heavily throughout and he couldn't stop it,

296
00:30:39,234 --> 00:30:41,200
so he felt very challenged!

297
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,334
When I went up he was sitting on his own stone outside the cave,

298
00:30:45,467 --> 00:30:47,067
and he was doing like this [twisting his head], with anger.

299
00:30:47,067 --> 00:30:52,100
He didn't know what to do. I looked at him then I walked

300
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:56,500
into his cave and sat down nicely, then he came, they brought him.

301
00:30:59,033 --> 00:31:01,067
He touched my feet, everything he did and then he said,

302
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:05,067
"You tell me now - why did you not allow me to stop the water?

303
00:31:05,067 --> 00:31:10,334
You got completely drenched. I'm very angry with this rain I know.

304
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,133
But why did you do that? Is it to control my ego?"

305
00:31:15,334 --> 00:31:20,033
I said "No, not at all I never knew you had ego or anything,"

306
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:28,234
"Then why?" So - because I'm a master as you know -

307
00:31:29,067 --> 00:31:33,400
I said "You see you are a sanyasi and you brought a sari for Me,

308
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,033
that too of an orange colour, and I would

309
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,400
not take the orange colour sari from you.

310
00:31:39,067 --> 00:31:41,367
Any sari I wouldn't take, because you're a sanyasi.

311
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:45,067
But I had to get drenched to get the sari, isn't it?"

312
00:31:45,267 --> 00:31:53,067
Immediately - he melted away. But I had to be the master.

313
00:31:56,534 --> 00:32:04,534
First of all how to melt him and secondly the master of his mind.

314
00:32:06,067 --> 00:32:12,267
This is the subtler part of it. You can be a master of a person.

315
00:32:13,267 --> 00:32:16,334
Like that you can know what he has done for you,

316
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,467
what he has prepared for you, what is coming for you.

317
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:25,067
I wouldn't say that you'd know all the whole future.

318
00:32:25,067 --> 00:32:29,334
But if you try just to know about a person -

319
00:32:30,167 --> 00:32:34,067
you can know everything about that person, very simple.

320
00:32:34,334 --> 00:32:38,067
So first try to understand a person.

321
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:43,334
My father had lots of tricks with him, I know,

322
00:32:44,133 --> 00:32:47,167
and a very humorous person.

323
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:51,067
And one day My brother told me, Babamama,

324
00:32:51,067 --> 00:32:54,067
that he has a friend who sings very well.

325
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,267
So I asked my father "How does he sing?"

326
00:32:57,367 --> 00:33:01,434
"Oh, he is very courageous," he said. I said "Why?"

327
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:05,200
"He sings whether he knows or not - that's the trouble!"

328
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:11,000
What an exact description he gave Me of this gentleman!

329
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,500
"He's very courageous you see.

330
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:15,500
He doesn't know but he sings - quite alright,

331
00:33:16,133 --> 00:33:19,567
so he's very courageous." I mean, he didn't say anything against him -

332
00:33:20,067 --> 00:33:21,334
he said "He's courageous" -

333
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:24,067
but he gave Me the complete picture of the gentleman that:

334
00:33:24,067 --> 00:33:27,234
"You have to be careful you see, he might start singing in a funny way,

335
00:33:27,267 --> 00:33:31,067
you shouldn't laugh." And, all that came in that 'courageous' word.

336
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:36,067
In the same way, if you study someone, you see,

337
00:33:39,067 --> 00:33:44,067
then you will just describe that person in an interesting way,

338
00:33:45,033 --> 00:33:47,067
and you will not feel that this person has these bad habits

339
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:51,067
or those bad habits or this is wrong with him, that is wrong,

340
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,067
but you'll describe - it's part of that person.

341
00:33:59,067 --> 00:34:04,067
It's a way of knowing a person in totality with all his defects,

342
00:34:04,067 --> 00:34:06,067
with all his qualities, with everything

343
00:34:06,067 --> 00:34:10,067
and accepting that person as he is.

344
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,267
If that mastery you can have.

345
00:34:15,033 --> 00:34:19,100
Now how will you have? If your attention is not on his

346
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,133
qualities you'll only know his bad things.

347
00:34:25,133 --> 00:34:30,167
And if you know his qualities then bad things will be there, a little bit,

348
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:35,167
but they'll just be adding a little massala to his character.

349
00:34:36,067 --> 00:34:40,267
You'll feel "ahhhh, that's it, you see, he is a little bit like that."

350
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:47,267
Little additional swara (musical note) is added to his character.

351
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:53,267
And you wouldn't mind it so much, such a person. You'll really enjoy.

352
00:34:54,267 --> 00:34:57,367
Like my son-in-law is very fond of dogs

353
00:34:58,033 --> 00:35:00,234
and his wife says, "no dog in the house," it's a flat.

354
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:03,200
So there is a fight between them for the dog.

355
00:35:04,067 --> 00:35:05,500
So Prabhat said "You never meet me,"

356
00:35:06,033 --> 00:35:12,067
I said "This is not proper but next time I have decided to be a dog,"

357
00:35:12,534 --> 00:35:18,534
Immediately he took the point. You see, so the way you talk to a person

358
00:35:19,267 --> 00:35:25,067
you can suggest to him what is so special about that person

359
00:35:25,267 --> 00:35:27,534
or the defects of that person.

360
00:35:28,567 --> 00:35:31,601
But you need not say directly something to him.

361
00:35:34,267 --> 00:35:39,400
If you say indirectly, in such a humorous manner

362
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
that the person will understand.

363
00:35:43,167 --> 00:35:51,167
So in communication with others you have to be a very humorous person.

364
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:58,234
But mostly I've seen people have humour if somebody cannot walk straight.

365
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,567
If a physical problem is there they'll laugh.

366
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,601
If he has not properly made his hair then they will laugh.

367
00:36:06,133 --> 00:36:11,267
On some sort of a very superficial thing they laugh. This is not humorous.

368
00:36:11,534 --> 00:36:15,601
This is some sort of a criticism in laughter.

369
00:36:16,467 --> 00:36:24,100
Or some people have a humour like this that they say sarcastic things.

370
00:36:25,067 --> 00:36:26,300
that's no good.

371
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,067
You say one word to somebody, sarcastic; you think you are very brilliant,

372
00:36:31,267 --> 00:36:33,334
but you are lost forever for that person.

373
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:37,067
That person will remember "He said such a such things to me."

374
00:36:37,367 --> 00:36:42,400
So sarcasm is against you completely; against Sahaja Yoga.

375
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:47,067
If you have to say something, say it in such a manner

376
00:36:47,067 --> 00:36:49,334
that it doesn't hurt the person,

377
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:58,067
and the person enjoys that subtle humour

378
00:36:58,234 --> 00:37:02,067
and understands also that "This is the problem with me".

379
00:37:04,601 --> 00:37:15,067
Now in a humorous way, if I have to tell something to you -

380
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:18,400
I need not tell you directly, "You are like this, you are like that,"

381
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:25,100
but I'll say, "There was one crow which came to my house..."

382
00:37:25,634 --> 00:37:29,234
and, like that, I can transfer all your qualities to that crow

383
00:37:29,267 --> 00:37:33,667
and describe to you and say that, "This crow did like this and did that."

384
00:37:35,133 --> 00:37:38,234
Immediately you'll start thinking, "Is it about me Mother was saying

385
00:37:38,367 --> 00:37:46,067
or about the crow?" So transfer it to somebody else.

386
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:49,200
Transfer it to somebody else, that's the best way.

387
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,234
For example, if you want to say that:

388
00:37:52,267 --> 00:37:55,133
all the names of the people who are coming to the puja

389
00:37:55,367 --> 00:37:58,234
should be there at the right time.

390
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,300
So now, this time, Americans [are hosting].

391
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,601
Alright, "Americans have sent the word..." - they have not -

392
00:38:04,067 --> 00:38:06,334
"...have sent the word that all the names should be there."

393
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:10,067
No harm telling such lies, no harm.

394
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,000
So that people will not put it on you, they'll not be angry with you.

395
00:38:15,033 --> 00:38:18,234
At the most they'll be angry with the Americans - doesn't matter,

396
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:23,167
for the time being. So transfer it.

397
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:30,267
And this transference is 'astantar' as they call it.

398
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:37,200
To transfer from one hand to another hand, Shri Krishna was an expert.

399
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:42,067
There is a story about Him.

400
00:38:42,167 --> 00:38:47,067
He is called as Ranchordas, means He ran away from the battlefield.

401
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:51,200
He doesn't mind "I ran away, so what?"

402
00:38:52,033 --> 00:38:56,400
The reason was like this: there was a very bad rakshasa

403
00:38:56,467 --> 00:39:01,300
who had all kinds of boons from Brahmadeva

404
00:39:01,567 --> 00:39:05,067
and Shri Krishna didn't know how to overcome that,

405
00:39:05,067 --> 00:39:08,067
nobody knew, and He was killing so many people.

406
00:39:09,267 --> 00:39:13,534
So He thought of a trick, transfer it to somebody else.

407
00:39:14,334 --> 00:39:19,267
He knew of another great yogi you see, special type,

408
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:26,000
who has meditated and taken a boon from the same Brahmadeva

409
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:32,067
that: "If I'm sleeping and anybody disturbs my sleep

410
00:39:32,067 --> 00:39:34,100
and if I open my eyes

411
00:39:34,467 --> 00:39:40,100
and look at that person, that person should become ashes - bhasma."

412
00:39:42,067 --> 00:39:46,500
So Shri Krishna thought of Him, "Better transfer the job from me to Him."

413
00:39:47,334 --> 00:39:51,300
So He started running away from the field.

414
00:39:51,434 --> 00:39:54,300
So this Rakshasa also followed Him.

415
00:39:54,634 --> 00:40:02,334
Then Shri Krishna stealthily went into the cave of this avadhuta,

416
00:40:02,601 --> 00:40:09,067
and put His own shawl on top of Him, covered Him,

417
00:40:10,067 --> 00:40:14,067
and hid himself in the cave.

418
00:40:15,033 --> 00:40:18,400
Now this Rakshasa came here, he thought this was Shri Krishna who was sleeping,

419
00:40:18,601 --> 00:40:21,167
"Ahhh now you are tired, you are sleeping.

420
00:40:21,267 --> 00:40:24,300
Now I'm going to see how you can save yourself."

421
00:40:24,467 --> 00:40:27,033
And he started waking [him] up.

422
00:40:27,234 --> 00:40:32,400
This avadhuta got up and looked at him and he became bhasma (ashes).

423
00:40:33,434 --> 00:40:41,100
So transfer your jobs to a more capable (Shri Mataji laughs) person

424
00:40:43,367 --> 00:40:48,601
who can do this better, than taking upon yourself

425
00:40:49,167 --> 00:40:52,601
straight-forward, going, "Alright,come long, I'll fight with you."

426
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,400
you cannot win. It's a guerrilla warfare as you call it.

427
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:03,634
Transfer it, and you can transfer it to somebody,

428
00:41:04,367 --> 00:41:08,100
you can make friends with that person, pamper his ego; do what you like.

429
00:41:08,267 --> 00:41:13,200
But the main point is that you should get rid of the ills,

430
00:41:13,434 --> 00:41:18,267
the bad, the rakshasas. So you can transfer it to anyone.

431
00:41:20,634 --> 00:41:23,634
And so many tricks He played.

432
00:41:29,534 --> 00:41:37,434
In the Mahabharata, Bhishma had a blessing

433
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:45,067
that, unless and until he wants to die, nobody can kill him.

434
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:58,267
So Shri Krishna decided that He should use some tricks.

435
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:05,067
So He told Arjuna that you put him...

436
00:42:05,601 --> 00:42:07,400
He told Arjuna not himself;

437
00:42:07,534 --> 00:42:14,067
He was just doing the chariot drivers job - Sarathi.

438
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:22,500
So Krishna told him that you just make him sleep on the arrows,

439
00:42:23,267 --> 00:42:29,000
let His body be on the arrows and he has to decide that he will die.

440
00:42:30,567 --> 00:42:41,400
But Dronacharya was a great guru, also of Arjuna, who was siding with Kauravas.

441
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:47,367
Now how can you kill this Dhronacharya, big problem.

442
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:56,400
Because you see, he knew all the tricks of archery.

443
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,267
How are you going to save them?

444
00:43:02,601 --> 00:43:07,167
Because archery is such a thing that he was the master of archery,

445
00:43:07,367 --> 00:43:10,500
while Arjuna was his disciple.

446
00:43:11,601 --> 00:43:37,434
So how to stop him, answering back the arrows of Arjuna?

447
00:43:38,033 --> 00:43:41,367
How to do that, that he doesn't answer back?

448
00:43:41,601 --> 00:43:50,634
Because he was a master. So Krishna organized it, in a very special way.

449
00:43:51,234 --> 00:43:55,534
He got a Shikhandi, a eunuch.

450
00:43:56,067 --> 00:44:00,067
What is the advantage of having a eunuch? Of course it's a big story

451
00:44:00,067 --> 00:44:06,234
how they became Shikhandi. But He got him in front of Arjuna.

452
00:44:07,267 --> 00:44:11,133
A eunuch in India is regarded as a woman,

453
00:44:12,167 --> 00:44:20,133
so Dhronacharya said, "I cannot kill a woman,"

454
00:44:22,133 --> 00:44:26,267
and that's how He killed Dhronacharya.

455
00:44:27,534 --> 00:44:33,200
So [He played] these tricks, because to get rid of ill is the main thing.

456
00:44:33,434 --> 00:44:35,400
To get rid of the ill -

457
00:44:35,567 --> 00:44:39,234
if you are not capable - you better tell somebody else to get rid.

458
00:44:39,234 --> 00:44:44,200
Because that is very important - to get rid of the evil -

459
00:44:45,267 --> 00:44:49,100
and if you can transfer this to somebody else who is more capable,

460
00:44:49,167 --> 00:44:55,100
in your own humility, you'll do much better than to directly attack that person.

461
00:44:56,033 --> 00:44:58,133
That's Tomfoolery. No use.

462
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:02,601
So this was the trick of Shri Krishna throughout.

463
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:09,334
If you have seen Mahabharata. Shri Krishna told Arjuna that,

464
00:45:09,601 --> 00:45:15,033
"Either you can the have all of My army or you can have Me."

465
00:45:15,534 --> 00:45:20,033
Same He told to the Kauravas. The Kauravas said, "We'll have your army."

466
00:45:20,434 --> 00:45:24,667
But Arjuna said, "You will be mine, Krishna You'll be on our side."

467
00:45:25,167 --> 00:45:30,267
But He said, "No, I'll be just on the chariot. I'll not hold any weapon."

468
00:45:30,367 --> 00:45:37,267
But He is a master of tricks. He does not need any weapons with Him.

469
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:39,500
Without weapons also He can do everything.

470
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:46,067
So Arjuna said, "alright, You be my chariot driver," and He was there.

471
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:55,067
Because Shri Krishna knew about each and every thing, mostly He used to smile.

472
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,267
Now, if somebody's telling Me something,

473
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:04,000
sometimes you will find I also smile, but I try to control

474
00:46:04,267 --> 00:46:06,234
because I don't want them to see.

475
00:46:06,434 --> 00:46:11,167
But I know what they are doing, what they're up to, what is their trick.

476
00:46:11,467 --> 00:46:15,067
Because you are such a trick master you know all the tricks

477
00:46:15,634 --> 00:46:18,133
and you know what they are playing with you.

478
00:46:18,334 --> 00:46:23,601
So you just smile about it, just to smile in a very sweet way,

479
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,400
"ah, that's it. Ah, of course, what you say is true, no doubt."

480
00:46:30,067 --> 00:46:34,234
But, by this kind of thing, you'll be surprised, your communications

481
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:38,300
will improve very much with others.

482
00:46:39,267 --> 00:46:43,500
Now some people I've seen in Sahaja Yoga - very common, very common,

483
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:50,234
"Mother", they came and told me, "our leader told me, that you are bhootish."

484
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,167
What is bhootish?"

485
00:46:53,367 --> 00:46:57,200
Another one says, "But he told me that you are a bhoot," - alright.

486
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:02,033
And somebody says, "Mother no he told me that you have got a bhoot in you.

487
00:47:02,067 --> 00:47:05,367
Now what are these three categories? Tell us."

488
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:12,334
Why to tell anybody you are bhootish or anything? There's no need.

489
00:47:13,067 --> 00:47:17,067
If you know how to correct it, just say "left Swadisthana" and correct it.

490
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,100
Take it out. Ask him, if he had any guru or anything.

491
00:47:21,467 --> 00:47:25,234
Alright, if the person is good natured and a good person

492
00:47:26,067 --> 00:47:28,000
then it's even more important.

493
00:47:28,234 --> 00:47:31,200
You should say "It's nothing, you see, it's just a badha from outside.

494
00:47:31,234 --> 00:47:33,067
We'll have to take it out."

495
00:47:33,567 --> 00:47:38,300
But a person who has got agnya and all these things,

496
00:47:38,334 --> 00:47:42,601
plus that he has got this left Swadisthana,

497
00:47:43,067 --> 00:47:45,400
then, of course, you should say, "Baba, we cannot help you,"

498
00:47:46,067 --> 00:47:48,267
because you know he is cunning.

499
00:47:49,133 --> 00:47:50,667
What's the use of playing with that?

500
00:47:51,367 --> 00:47:53,500
But in Sahaja Yoga we forget.

501
00:47:53,567 --> 00:47:58,067
Anybody who comes "Alright, come along, come along, come along."

502
00:48:00,033 --> 00:48:06,133
Everybody is not capable of Sahaja Yoga, one has to know that.

503
00:48:06,567 --> 00:48:08,334
Not the whole world.

504
00:48:10,167 --> 00:48:14,267
Sahaja Yoga can only be given to people who are deserving,

505
00:48:14,367 --> 00:48:20,467
who are seekers and who are courageous - viras.

506
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,300
It's not meant for ordinary people.

507
00:48:24,133 --> 00:48:29,067
So we open our door to everyone and all such people walk in

508
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,400
and then we work very hard on them, do all kinds of things,

509
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:37,267
and we find that they create problems for us.

510
00:48:39,367 --> 00:48:43,100
So first, only deal with people who are simple,

511
00:48:43,267 --> 00:48:46,334
as Shri Krishna dealt with Gopas and Gopis;

512
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:52,400
and then we can see, in a collective way, if we can face somebody who's complicated.

513
00:48:53,167 --> 00:48:59,467
But no use transforming Hitler or Rajneesh, not possible.

514
00:49:00,634 --> 00:49:04,634
So one should not try to do impossible tasks in Sahaja Yoga,

515
00:49:05,367 --> 00:49:08,400
which Shri Krishna has shown in His own character

516
00:49:09,334 --> 00:49:13,300
by avoiding things which He didn't want to do - no.

517
00:49:16,033 --> 00:49:19,167
And He did it because He was such a master.

518
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:24,601
Of course, for Him, it was not necessary to face himself

519
00:49:25,033 --> 00:49:27,267
to master himself, because He knew himself,

520
00:49:27,434 --> 00:49:31,467
He is the Ishwara of yoga, He knew everything.

521
00:49:32,601 --> 00:49:34,300
When you know everything

522
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,400
there is no need for you to master, what are you going to master?

523
00:49:38,067 --> 00:49:42,267
On the contrary you sometimes get frightened of yourself, that you know so much.

524
00:49:45,667 --> 00:49:53,067
So, best is that, when we are dealing as human beings in Sahaja Yoga,

525
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:57,601
we have to know ourselves very well - "Now oh that's my speciality."

526
00:49:58,667 --> 00:50:03,067
In that you have to see: "How I face myself all the time?

527
00:50:05,067 --> 00:50:10,434
Why do I say such a thing? What is lurking in my mind?"

528
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:16,500
Negativity is something to be seen very clearly within yourself.

529
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,601
As I must have told you so many examples

530
00:50:20,133 --> 00:50:22,100
that the western negativity is like this

531
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:26,467
that, their minds are all the time labor saving devices.

532
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:31,367
They don't like to work anyway.

533
00:50:31,534 --> 00:50:39,234
For example, you tell them "You go and telephone to someone."

534
00:50:39,601 --> 00:50:43,067
Immediately they will tell you ten explanations:

535
00:50:43,234 --> 00:50:48,334
he may not be there, his wife will shout, he might have gone to work,

536
00:50:48,567 --> 00:50:52,400
it's ten o'clock, this, that.

537
00:50:53,334 --> 00:50:58,400
But if you telephone he's there, but they won't telephone.

538
00:50:59,434 --> 00:51:04,067
Hundred excuses. Now new excuses have started:

539
00:51:04,234 --> 00:51:08,367
"the computer was not working, fax was not working."

540
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,100
Except for your brain everything works.

541
00:51:13,367 --> 00:51:15,500
But the other way around it is:

542
00:51:16,234 --> 00:51:20,100
your brain is not working and everything is not working.

543
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,267
"The lights were not working." I mean, whatever it is.

544
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:30,367
But you must learn, "Why can't I find the solution?

545
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,267
I must do something."

546
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:38,234
Like I have told you, the tip of a root -

547
00:51:38,467 --> 00:51:44,334
how it manages to go round and round and seek the source of water.

548
00:51:45,434 --> 00:51:48,067
In the same way, are we doing something about it?

549
00:51:48,133 --> 00:51:50,267
Alright, if this is not available, do that,

550
00:51:51,067 --> 00:51:52,634
if that is not available do this.

551
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,601
Out of nothing you can do so many things.

552
00:51:57,567 --> 00:52:03,334
But if you want to find out all the time "That cannot be done, that cannot be done".

553
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:06,467
[That was] not [the case] with Shri Krishna!

554
00:52:07,067 --> 00:52:11,067
After all He was the incarnation of Virata,

555
00:52:11,601 --> 00:52:14,067
the Master of Masters we should say.

556
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:21,067
Like when Draupadi was in trouble - Draupadi was actually Vishnumaya His sister -

557
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,634
She thought of Shri Krishna.

558
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:29,434
She was holding onto her sari, when it was pulled out by Duryodhana.

559
00:52:29,601 --> 00:52:32,100
And She was holding it like this (with Her teeth). "Kri",

560
00:52:32,267 --> 00:52:35,400
She wanted to say "Krishna" but She said, "If I say 'shna' it will fall down."

561
00:52:36,033 --> 00:52:38,067
So She was holding on.

562
00:52:38,434 --> 00:52:41,234
As soon as She dropped it, "shna",

563
00:52:42,267 --> 00:52:49,133
sari dropped out (of Her mouth), then it's described, about Shri Krishna,

564
00:52:52,067 --> 00:52:58,234
"Dwarika me shora bhayo, shor bhayo bhare.

565
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:04,067
Shankha chakra gadaa padma, Garuda laysidhare."

566
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:10,167
[Meaning:] that sound went into Dwarika. Now where is Dwarika

567
00:53:10,267 --> 00:53:14,434
and where is Hastinapur - at least a distance of two thousands miles [apart].

568
00:53:15,267 --> 00:53:24,400
But the sound went through Chaitanya and made a big sound there;

569
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,100
and "Shankha Chakra Gadaa Padma".

570
00:53:29,334 --> 00:53:33,100
Shankha, Chakra Gadaa, Padma are the weapons (of Vishnu) as you know.

571
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:39,067
All of them He took and came on His Garuda

572
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:42,500
to save the chastity of His sister -

573
00:53:43,267 --> 00:53:48,234
immediately, spontaneously, that moment.

574
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:53,434
He could have said, "Alright let it be, let one sari come out then I'll go later."

575
00:53:55,667 --> 00:54:01,367
I'm sure He must have stolen My saris which you give for My Pujas,

576
00:54:01,467 --> 00:54:03,300
which are too many!

577
00:54:03,634 --> 00:54:09,567
That's what I feel, that, from where did He get all these saris to give to Her?

578
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:13,267
Must be from My own storage I'm sure,

579
00:54:13,367 --> 00:54:15,500
and that's why you are giving Me so many saris,

580
00:54:16,067 --> 00:54:19,567
so that He can save the chastity of many women.

581
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:29,033
All this is so related, so connected, so one, so united.

582
00:54:29,067 --> 00:54:34,334
There's such a big drama going on but you can't see it.

583
00:54:35,667 --> 00:54:40,000
But if you believe in yourself

584
00:54:40,434 --> 00:54:47,467
and if you really believe that you are a Sahaja Yogi,

585
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:54,067
that: what are your qualities, what you are, what's your value is,

586
00:54:55,601 --> 00:55:01,567
then I'm sure you can become masters.

587
00:55:02,167 --> 00:55:06,100
But first of all we have no value of our realization.

588
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:10,267
We do not know what we are capable of, what we can do.

589
00:55:11,067 --> 00:55:14,267
You still think, "oh, I was such an ordinary person,

590
00:55:14,367 --> 00:55:18,067
Mother has given me realization. I have never been to university."

591
00:55:18,234 --> 00:55:20,100
Nobody has been to university.

592
00:55:24,367 --> 00:55:27,367
I mean, if you see, Rama never went to any university,

593
00:55:27,534 --> 00:55:30,167
Krishna never went into university,

594
00:55:30,267 --> 00:55:35,033
Christ never went to any university, an ordinary man, a son of a carpenter.

595
00:55:36,067 --> 00:55:40,234
But you are realized souls but you don't realize your worth and value.

596
00:55:40,634 --> 00:55:43,267
Once you realize it, you will just smile at everything.

597
00:55:43,367 --> 00:55:47,067
Because you don't know you are sitting on top of the world.

598
00:55:48,801 --> 00:55:52,033
Once you know that - only then your mastery will work.

599
00:55:52,067 --> 00:55:56,133
Otherwise imagine a master sitting under the foot of a disciple,

600
00:55:56,467 --> 00:55:58,234
what will it look like?

601
00:55:58,667 --> 00:56:01,567
But it's not that you dominate

602
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:07,067
but you are in charge, absolutely in charge.

603
00:56:08,767 --> 00:56:12,300
You know everything, you know how to handle, you know how to manage.

604
00:56:13,067 --> 00:56:15,133
This is the mastery you have to get.

605
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:19,667
This is possible, absolutely possible, for all of you to do it.

606
00:56:20,067 --> 00:56:22,434
But the first and foremost thing you have to know

607
00:56:22,467 --> 00:56:25,067
is that we have to master ourselves.

608
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,801
But then immediately people say

609
00:56:28,167 --> 00:56:33,200
"Mother it's the most difficult to master yourself."

610
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:37,300
I can't understand this.

611
00:56:38,434 --> 00:56:43,067
Why not? You try to master everyone, why can't you master yourself?

612
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:49,367
Yourself is with you, you are with yourself, it's your own,

613
00:56:49,801 --> 00:56:55,601
it's your own property. You can correct the property of others,

614
00:56:55,734 --> 00:56:58,067
why can't you correct your own property?

615
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,067
It should be the easiest thing to do

616
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:04,167
but you're not sure that this is your own,

617
00:57:04,434 --> 00:57:08,100
you do not know that you are capable, but you are

618
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,601
and now you have Self-knowledge, so why should you not do it?

619
00:57:14,033 --> 00:57:17,734
Why should you not try to watch yourself and see for yourself?

620
00:57:18,033 --> 00:57:24,067
And then you will know that you know all the tricks, the yukti.

621
00:57:26,133 --> 00:57:28,701
I don't have to tell you "do this, do that," nothing!

622
00:57:29,067 --> 00:57:32,234
You yourself will know "ha, come along!"

623
00:57:33,567 --> 00:57:40,000
We know so many things, little things, about ordinary material things:

624
00:57:40,467 --> 00:57:44,434
something's falling? Alright - put some support to it.

625
00:57:44,734 --> 00:57:47,701
This is happening? Put it that way.

626
00:57:48,334 --> 00:57:53,067
But in spiritual life it's the easiest thing

627
00:57:53,067 --> 00:57:56,467
because you are in the ocean of knowledge.

628
00:57:59,467 --> 00:58:02,534
But if you do not know that you are, in the ocean of knowledge,

629
00:58:03,033 --> 00:58:06,300
you will not know the tricks, of dealing with others.

630
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:11,467
Because the main purpose of our communication is to emancipate

631
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:14,400
the whole world, to emancipate them.

632
00:58:14,534 --> 00:58:17,367
To bring them out of their ignorance.

633
00:58:17,767 --> 00:58:21,100
So for that we have to develop this mastery

634
00:58:23,434 --> 00:58:26,434
and not to get lost into nonsensical things

635
00:58:27,067 --> 00:58:29,067
but this mastery has to be developed.

636
00:58:29,067 --> 00:58:33,200
For that, meditation early in the morning is required

637
00:58:34,067 --> 00:58:38,067
- to begin with. And then facing yourself

638
00:58:39,067 --> 00:58:42,100
all the time, "Why did I say such a thing?"

639
00:58:42,434 --> 00:58:48,067
"Aah must be this. This is the word I picked up from that person."

640
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:53,067
So when you start facing yourself, you will be surprised

641
00:58:53,133 --> 00:58:59,634
that you are trying to avoid the reality and just using your mind.

642
00:59:00,067 --> 00:59:04,300
See there, as I say, that this mind cheats you

643
00:59:04,534 --> 00:59:08,067
and tells you, "all right, forget it".

644
00:59:11,033 --> 00:59:13,701
And the last, but not the least,

645
00:59:14,367 --> 00:59:23,100
is that Shri Krishna is the one who is an expert of drama.

646
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:33,067
He creates drama, He acts in the drama, and He's the spectator also.

647
00:59:35,067 --> 00:59:37,400
In these three forms you should see yourself.

648
00:59:37,734 --> 00:59:43,767
You create the drama of yourself, "aha this one now, see now,

649
00:59:44,267 --> 00:59:47,234
how I'm acting here!"

650
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:50,367
Then you become the spectator also.

651
00:59:50,801 --> 00:59:54,067
Become the spectator of your own dramas,

652
00:59:54,701 --> 00:59:59,133
then you will realize what you are doing,

653
01:00:00,033 --> 01:00:02,701
how you are working out everything.

654
01:00:03,567 --> 01:00:09,067
Then the deception that we have, all the time, against ourselves,

655
01:00:10,033 --> 01:00:11,567
will just run away.

656
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:16,067
Because if an artist knows he's the spectator,

657
01:00:16,467 --> 01:00:20,067
if the one who is acting knows he is the spectator,

658
01:00:20,167 --> 01:00:25,067
he can never deceive himself, because He knows this is acting.

659
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:32,067
So this self-deception is the one [that] one should try to avoid -

660
01:00:32,534 --> 01:00:34,467
"let me face it."

661
01:00:35,067 --> 01:00:38,767
But also there is another way out, people find out.

662
01:00:39,067 --> 01:00:40,767
I mean, there are ways and ways.

663
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:45,033
Like you tell somebody, "why didn't you write a letter?"

664
01:00:45,067 --> 01:00:47,400
"I know!" 'I know' means what?

665
01:00:48,234 --> 01:00:51,334
"But don't you think you should have written a letter to that person,

666
01:00:51,601 --> 01:00:55,067
who has done so much for you?" "I know."

667
01:00:57,534 --> 01:01:00,400
"But don't you think it's very bad and cruel on your part

668
01:01:00,467 --> 01:01:03,234
not to have written the letter?" "I know."

669
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:09,434
'I know' means what? "I know I'm bad. I know I have been stupid.

670
01:01:09,567 --> 01:01:13,234
I know I should not have done it. But I know also that."

671
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,400
So what next?

672
01:01:16,167 --> 01:01:19,334
Because they think that if they have confessed that "I know," [it's] finished!

673
01:01:19,734 --> 01:01:23,000
So this is a new escape which was not [there] at the time of Shri Krishna,

674
01:01:23,133 --> 01:01:27,734
it's a new modern one, where people say "I know, alright so what?"

675
01:01:28,033 --> 01:01:33,667
"Ohhh alright I'm a sinner so what?" This is the second side of it.

676
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,701
First of all "I know that I'm a sinner"

677
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:43,067
and second is a higher state is that: "so what, what's wrong?"

678
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:49,300
So this is how the derailment starts and one goes from one to another.

679
01:01:49,701 --> 01:01:54,367
If I know something then why shouldn't I correct myself?

680
01:01:57,334 --> 01:02:03,367
That's what it should be. "I know I'm like that I know it."

681
01:02:04,601 --> 01:02:09,067
If you know then you should also know the trick - how to get rid of it.

682
01:02:09,234 --> 01:02:14,400
Because you are detached from that personality about which you know,

683
01:02:14,801 --> 01:02:16,367
you can correct yourself.

684
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:22,334
This is what yoga is, where all your attention is one with the Divine

685
01:02:22,801 --> 01:02:26,567
and you are so detached that you can see it.

686
01:02:27,067 --> 01:02:35,167
The attachment to all the things are finished

687
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:40,167
and now the force that is coming to you is acting through you

688
01:02:40,234 --> 01:02:43,634
and acting on these attachments also.

689
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:52,200
The situation changes, absolutely, in Sahaja Yoga in a very different way,

690
01:02:52,434 --> 01:02:55,567
and if there is one bad Sahaja Yogi who comes in,

691
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,567
either he's thrown out or he has to be alright.

692
01:02:59,167 --> 01:03:01,067
It's the other way around.

693
01:03:01,234 --> 01:03:04,434
Anyone who is a bad Sahaja Yogi, if he comes in Sahaja Yoga,

694
01:03:04,601 --> 01:03:08,067
then he has to be corrected, otherwise thrown out.

695
01:03:09,033 --> 01:03:14,234
It is a, I think, a more evolved state now

696
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:19,133
than it was at the time of Shri Krishna, because He talked only to one, Arjuna.

697
01:03:19,167 --> 01:03:22,200
Now I'm talking to thousands - this knowledge.

698
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:28,300
That time He just talked about it at the time of war.

699
01:03:28,334 --> 01:03:30,667
I'm talking at the time of peace.

700
01:03:31,601 --> 01:03:37,000
And it's much more evolved because Shri Krishna didn't give him realization.

701
01:03:37,367 --> 01:03:40,534
But you have got the realization, you've got the knowledge,

702
01:03:40,601 --> 01:03:44,167
you know everything. You have all the subtle ideas.

703
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:49,667
So this is what it is today, as it is, the situation is that

704
01:03:49,767 --> 01:03:53,067
you have become part and parcel of Virata already.

705
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:55,067
You have not seen the Virata (as Arjuna did),

706
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:57,267
but you are part and parcel of it.

707
01:03:58,067 --> 01:04:00,434
You are not watching it, you are inside it.

708
01:04:01,033 --> 01:04:07,667
So that anymore of not watching yourself,

709
01:04:08,434 --> 01:04:12,734
will be only thing that you'll be thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

710
01:04:13,267 --> 01:04:18,667
Or else you better watch yourself and correct yourself

711
01:04:19,067 --> 01:04:22,167
and be one with the body of the Virata.

712
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:26,267
This is the sign of a Yogeshwara,

713
01:04:26,534 --> 01:04:31,567
and that's how you have to be, in a mood which is very smiling,

714
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:35,734
knowing everything and not sarcastic,

715
01:04:36,334 --> 01:04:42,767
but [with a] very paternal smile, very loving, affectionate smile,

716
01:04:43,067 --> 01:04:46,234
that you should have for all the other people

717
01:04:47,234 --> 01:04:48,701
and immediately they'll recognize.

718
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,067
I have seen small children are like that.

719
01:04:52,601 --> 01:04:55,234
They are extremely patronising sometimes, you know.

720
01:04:55,267 --> 01:04:57,234
They see their parents and this and that.

721
01:04:58,067 --> 01:05:03,267
So they come and tell you that, "don't worry everything will be all right,

722
01:05:03,334 --> 01:05:06,334
after all God is there to look after you."

723
01:05:08,167 --> 01:05:14,000
And they can be extremely loving and kind and the way they talk

724
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:16,067
they will neutralize the whole thing.

725
01:05:16,234 --> 01:05:19,067
So we have to learn a lot from our children,

726
01:05:19,267 --> 01:05:22,067
from all the little babies that we have

727
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:29,067
and that we ourselves should have that Ganesha principal within us,

728
01:05:29,067 --> 01:05:31,701
with innocence we should work it out.

729
01:05:32,067 --> 01:05:35,734
Innocence is the most intelligent thing and most effective thing.

730
01:05:36,334 --> 01:05:40,167
So I would request you, all of you, to face yourself

731
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,667
and don't hate yourself but correct yourself,

732
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,067
respect yourself and try to evolve your own glory.

733
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:51,234
May God bless you.
