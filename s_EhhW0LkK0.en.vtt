00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.705
﻿So, this is to thank you all for

00:00:06.335 --> 00:00:08.877
helping in building this house

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.517
and making it so beautiful.

00:00:16.507 --> 00:00:18.397
All the thankfulness

00:00:20.054 --> 00:00:21.803
is from

00:00:22.678 --> 00:00:24.991
us, both of us, to you.

00:00:27.948 --> 00:00:29.554
Today is a very

00:00:29.755 --> 00:00:32.260
interesting day when

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.277
you are worshipping the Gruhalakshmi here,

00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:39.317
means the Gruhalakshmi of this house.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.041
In the same way

00:00:43.267 --> 00:00:46.723
in your family also, in your houses, homes you must

00:00:46.923 --> 00:00:48.813
do Gruhalakshmis’ puja.

00:00:49.944 --> 00:00:51.933
The woman has to be

00:00:52.134 --> 00:00:54.145
the Gruhalakshmi herself

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:57.289
and then she should be worshipped.

00:00:58.022 --> 00:01:00.972
“Yatya naria pujyante, tatra bhramante Devata.”

00:01:01.173 --> 00:01:03.397
Where the women are respected

00:01:03.597 --> 00:01:06.139
and worshipped there

00:01:07.144 --> 00:01:09.772
reside all the deities.

00:01:09.973 --> 00:01:12.077
But they should be respectable also.

00:01:12.277 --> 00:01:14.445
If they are not respectable

00:01:14.645 --> 00:01:17.153
then the deities won’t reside there.

00:01:17.354 --> 00:01:18.932
So, it’s a big responsibility

00:01:19.132 --> 00:01:21.357
on a Gruhalakshmi to be respectable

00:01:21.557 --> 00:01:24.476
so that all the deities are happy in the family.

00:01:24.676 --> 00:01:26.917
And once she is respected,

00:01:27.117 --> 00:01:30.477
she will try to be respectable also.

00:01:30.677 --> 00:01:32.197
So, the respect

00:01:32.397 --> 00:01:35.016
of the Gruhalakshmi is very important.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.797
Today

00:01:40.006 --> 00:01:43.237
we are having this little puja

00:01:43.438 --> 00:01:45.443
from all the builders

00:01:45.643 --> 00:01:47.648
who helped us here,

00:01:48.037 --> 00:01:50.116
with the blessings of Vishwakarma

00:01:50.317 --> 00:01:51.985
and Brahmadeva;

00:01:52.186 --> 00:01:54.335
those who have tried

00:01:54.672 --> 00:01:57.872
to make this house so beautiful.

00:01:59.428 --> 00:02:02.932
Also, as you know, Blake has described this house.

00:02:03.132 --> 00:02:05.677
It has a special significance

00:02:06.353 --> 00:02:08.815
and we have to now

00:02:09.015 --> 00:02:10.677
hand it over to somebody else,

00:02:11.417 --> 00:02:15.317
the one who will appreciate and respect this house;

00:02:15.772 --> 00:02:19.117
who will understand the value and worth of this house.

00:02:19.477 --> 00:02:21.900
And for that we have to pray

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.419
that it will be sold to such a person

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.421
who is a person who will be

00:02:28.622 --> 00:02:32.424
a connoisseur, a person who will understand

00:02:32.625 --> 00:02:35.597
the depth and the

00:02:36.626 --> 00:02:38.277
aesthetics

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:40.877
of this place

00:02:41.648 --> 00:02:45.004
and the one who will be paying for that,

00:02:45.458 --> 00:02:46.986
valuing that.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.437
So, we have to ask

00:02:49.637 --> 00:02:51.317
for such a blessing.

00:02:56.068 --> 00:02:58.759
Of course, one should not get attached to anything.

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.797
Whatever is created,

00:03:01.568 --> 00:03:03.981
is created. One should never be attached.

00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:05.797
Because we have done this, so

00:03:05.997 --> 00:03:09.397
we should be attached to it, is not the way a Sahaja

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.494
Yogi should think about it.

00:03:11.695 --> 00:03:14.779
But one should think about that,
now we have created something beautiful

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:16.757
we can recreate another thing

00:03:16.957 --> 00:03:19.900
and we can produce other better things.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.397
That’s how an artist

00:03:21.597 --> 00:03:24.234
can go on producing and producing.

00:03:24.435 --> 00:03:25.717
Of course,

00:03:25.917 --> 00:03:28.437
there’s one thing: that if there is

00:03:28.787 --> 00:03:31.677
within us the joy,

00:03:34.596 --> 00:03:37.630
then only you produce joy.

00:03:37.831 --> 00:03:40.157
If there is no joy you cannot.

00:03:41.811 --> 00:03:43.517
So first of all

00:03:43.717 --> 00:03:45.947
before doing any work

00:03:46.148 --> 00:03:47.808
creating anything

00:03:48.237 --> 00:03:50.037
one must measure up

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:52.437
the amount of

00:03:53.841 --> 00:03:55.755
joy one has received,

00:03:55.955 --> 00:03:59.113
the blessings one has received from the Divine,

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.117
and then recreate.

00:04:01.317 --> 00:04:04.661
With that consciousness, with that awareness

00:04:04.862 --> 00:04:07.237
you’ll find your creation will be very beautiful.

00:04:07.437 --> 00:04:10.726
And we have to bring the world to a new

00:04:11.616 --> 00:04:14.237
method of creativity

00:04:14.852 --> 00:04:17.077
where there is exuberance,

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.197
exuberance,

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.308
of joy and

00:04:24.293 --> 00:04:27.917
of Divine aesthetics,

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.905
because the world is going from bad to worse.

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.373
I find nowadays people may just like to have

00:04:35.597 --> 00:04:39.317
some sort of a white cloth hanging and calling it a painting.

00:04:39.885 --> 00:04:42.421
That’s not a painting because there is nothing inside.

00:04:42.622 --> 00:04:45.277
It has become hollow, empty; there’s nothing inside,

00:04:45.477 --> 00:04:47.273
so that there is no exuberance.

00:04:47.474 --> 00:04:49.054
So, to recreate that,

00:04:49.254 --> 00:04:51.600
you people have to

00:04:52.491 --> 00:04:54.508
desire and ask for it,

00:04:54.708 --> 00:04:56.608
and we’ll have people of that kind.

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:58.475
It is just to be desired,

00:04:58.675 --> 00:05:00.797
and you all should desire for such things:

00:05:01.201 --> 00:05:04.397
that people of exuberance should come forward

00:05:04.597 --> 00:05:08.297
to value such things which are full of joy.

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:11.317
May God bless you.
