00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.560
After the great tour of U.K.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:33.510
I feel very confident that Sahaja Yoga is
taking its roots, and you can see some of

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.420
the plants coming up.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.760
It's surprising, when I declared that it may
be the last tour I'll be doing of U.K. that

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.430
things have started working out.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:52.469
Everywhere we went it was very good and successful,
specially certain places it was very miraculous.

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:59.970
You must have heard about the lady who would
not go out of her house, was suffering from

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.250
agoraphobia, and the press challenged us that
she should be cured because she can't go out

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.570
of the house.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.509
And only on her photograph and treatment she
got cured, and now she's walking about, and

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:18.100
they have given a big report saying that the
Guru fulfills Her promise.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.920
This is one of them and there are many things
have happened of this kind, of which you should

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.260
get the report.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:36.870
I must say I found all the Sahaja Yogis very
cooperative, very alert, very helpful and

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.090
extremely progressive.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.600
And I was happy that they are trying to come
up and improve themselves, build themselves

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.570
up, and are doing much better than what I
had expected, really.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:57.350
I was very, very enamored by all of them,
and I hope that by the time it is twelve years,

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:03.159
we'll be all absolutely top class Sahaja Yogis
of the world.

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:13.170
Now today is a very great day of Raksha Bandhan,
so I have to tell you something about Raksha

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.380
Bandhan.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:41.470
Before that we have to talk about the maryadas
that are to be observed by Sahaja Yogis.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:49.450
One of the things I discovered here in the
West, that though we have understood the importance

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.150
of Mooladhara, which is very important and
that unless and until we re-establish our

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:03.580
Mooladhara fully we are not going to have
a speediest ascent.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.670
Despite all that, still there are lingering
things you see around.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:20.700
Like people start choosing their life partners
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.930
That is not allowed, that is not allowed.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:37.069
You are not to spoil your ashrams, your centers,
using them for a marriage-searching society.

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.629
You must respect, this point you must respect.

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:48.050
If you have to marry, then you can find your
life partner outside Sahaja Yoga - to begin

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.050
with.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:57.510
But if you want to marry in Sahaja Yoga, then
you should not go on searching people in Sahaja

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.510
Yoga.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.190
Is a very dangerous thing for Sahaja Yoga
itself and for you people.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.610
That is one thing one should never try to
do with Sahaja Yogis.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.519
For all practical purposes you are brothers
and sisters.

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:18.829
And that's why I always encourage marriages
between people who belong to another country

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.910
or another centers.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:33.240
As we are now having a marriage - big program
- I would say that most of the marriages which

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.639
were done like that are very successful than
the marriages that were selected and were

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:40.639
done.

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:46.710
It's very wrong to do such a thing as to arrange
your marriage with a Sahaja Yogi by yourself.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.520
It will be dangerous.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.090
I don't want to say anything; but it won't
turn out to be good, because it is anti-God

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.090
activity, absolutely anti-God.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:02.240
You are supposed to develop your brahmacharya,
you are supposed to develop your Mooladhara.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.029
Instead of that, if you start using a Sahaja
Yogini or a Sahaja Yogi for the selection

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:11.199
of your married life, it's going to be very,
very troublesome.

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:13.189
Your Mooladhara will not settle down.

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:18.219
I mean that's a very bad stroke for your development.

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:24.060
Because of the background and the kind of
conditioning you have had, you people don't

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:31.569
understand that it is important to maintain
the purity of the centers, and of every place.

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:36.279
So any such relationship in one city is a
very wrong thing.

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:37.279
It spoils everyone.

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:44.289
To add up to the trouble, it's a habit of
people, I have heard, that they try to tease

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:47.569
that "You look better together, you are nice
together."

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:49.490
They tease and enjoy.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:57.219
It's a kind of a very perverted enjoyment
of Mooladhara, to tease others "You are looking

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:59.449
very nice with him, and you better marry."

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:01.889
It's a kind of a romantic nonsense.

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:06.939
Of course, for all this, yogis - they have
to have a brahmacharya.

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:10.250
But even if you can't have brahmacharya you
must have maryadas.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:17.110
Not to tease each other and enjoy that kind
of a nonsense, when the marriage is not settled.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.879
If marriage is settled, it is all right.

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:23.569
And this kills completely the joy of marriage,
because there is no curiosity left.

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:28.500
And many a times I find that absurd relations
are established.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.410
Some of them are really no good.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:35.169
And they will really be detrimental, and some
of them never are established.

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:41.099
So if they are established, they are wrong;
and if they are not established, they are

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:42.099
heartbreaking.

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:44.969
So all this kind of thing you should not do.

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:51.219
You have got experiences of people who married
outside and brought wonderful people to Sahaja

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:52.219
Yoga.

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:53.780
If you can do it, you should do it.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:59.529
But if you have to marry Sahaja Yogis, you
should not marry them at the cost of destroying

00:06:59.529 --> 00:07:02.210
the purity and the idealism it has.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:08.569
For your own sake, for your own pleasures,
you should not spoil the name of Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:13.710
That is one thing I have seen, so I would
say that today, as it is the day of purity

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:19.919
between relationships, let us know that you
have to treat each other as brothers and sisters.

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:24.599
No such play should be followed.

00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:26.729
Don't allow your mind to drift into this.

00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:29.580
Because if you allow, then there's no end
to it.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.759
As it is, you know how hard it is to bring
you back to normal.

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:42.449
When Christ had said, "Thou shalt not have
adulterous eyes," He didn't say it because

00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:43.669
it was not practical.

00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:45.939
It is quite practical for Sahaja Yogis.

00:07:45.939 --> 00:07:49.149
And there is nothing to worry about marriages
so much.

00:07:49.149 --> 00:07:50.280
What is so important?

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.559
So many are married and what has happened
to them.

00:07:53.559 --> 00:07:58.180
Even with Sahaja Yoga marriage, some of them
have failed because of these bad habits.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:02.729
So you better get rid of these bad habits
before marriage, because after marriage also

00:08:02.729 --> 00:08:05.779
they go on like this, and searching for boys
and girls.

00:08:05.779 --> 00:08:12.199
Because if these habits are not curbed before
marriage, then they go on lingering on.

00:08:12.199 --> 00:08:14.919
So one should not try to do all these things
before marriage.

00:08:14.919 --> 00:08:20.229
And I have seen such marriages are never,
never successful so far.

00:08:20.229 --> 00:08:23.319
And even if they are, it is a sort of make-believe
thing.

00:08:23.319 --> 00:08:26.479
It doesn't give real joy, it's a joyless pursuit.

00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:32.520
Maybe in one case, may be successful; that
doesn't mean that you should take any help

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:37.349
from such difficult things, but have normal
marriages which are enjoyable, which have

00:08:37.349 --> 00:08:42.080
created permanent bondages between people.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:50.300
All the marriages ...

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:58.490
Now we have to understand the maryadas, about
which I have told you before also.

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:04.670
The relationships between men and women are
only pure if a certain amount of boundaries

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:06.320
are kept.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:16.810
Like, supposing you have milk in one container
and you have got something else in another

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:17.930
container.

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:23.649
To keep the purity of one container, you have
to keep it in its bounds, in the cup.

00:09:23.649 --> 00:09:29.690
If you allow them to mix up, if they fall
together and they mix up, then there is no

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:30.690
purity.

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:32.400
It's a simple thing like that.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:39.399
One should understand that we have to understand
that how to keep our relationships in proper

00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:44.269
respect to each other's modesty and chastity.

00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:52.980
Now for example, there is a girl who is younger
to you.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:57.069
You must keep all the distance from such a
person.

00:09:57.069 --> 00:10:00.699
If she is much older than you, then it is
all right.

00:10:00.699 --> 00:10:07.279
You can talk, laugh, joke - she's much older
than you.

00:10:07.279 --> 00:10:12.410
But normally with a girl who is younger to
you, even much younger, you should try to

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:17.440
keep away, after all if she is a young girl;
not with the children, but still.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:21.380
You must learn these things: how to maintain
a distance.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:31.329
Now, there is a man who is younger to you,
then you must not have any funny ideas about

00:10:31.329 --> 00:10:33.860
such a person - is absolutely absurd.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:39.490
If some gentleman is younger to you, it is
only in perversion you do such things.

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:43.470
See, you should not have any funny ideas about
that person.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:49.579
It's only done when there are emergencies,
when there is no possibility of a marriage,

00:10:49.579 --> 00:10:55.939
when there are so many women or so many men
- or under perverted conditions.

00:10:55.939 --> 00:11:00.069
We don't have none of these conditions here,
so we have to behave like normal people.

00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:05.310
And when the proper atmosphere is given to
us, why not make use of it?

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.880
Why should we create absurd things?

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.310
Then they come out to Me saying that "Mother,
now we have decided to marry.

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:13.350
Let us marry."

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:14.350
I have to say "Yes."

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:18.790
To many things I don't want to say "Yes" but
I have to say "Yes."

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.930
But creates a very bad precedent.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.910
Maybe that in certain cases, as an exceptional
case, I might have chosen to marry somebody

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.100
like that.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:30.240
But that doesn't mean you should take things
into your hands, and just start doing things

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.040
like that, so that I'll have problems later.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.860
Because once you do like that, then anybody
starts doing it.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:40.550
It's a kind of an aggressiveness, that you
arrange something, come to Me, say.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:41.550
"Mother, we want to marry."

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:42.570
Now what am I to say?

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:44.189
"All right, marry."

00:11:44.189 --> 00:11:46.889
But it creates a problem for Me, for the rest
of the people.

00:11:46.889 --> 00:11:48.069
They will say, "All right.

00:11:48.069 --> 00:11:53.160
If he has married a girl who is twenty years
younger, why not I marry a girl who is thirty

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.160
years younger?"

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.160
You must understand My problems.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.850
If you ask Me for something, "Mother, should
I do it?"

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:58.680
You really force Me into it.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:04.519
I have to say "Yes" because I cannot be very
strict with you, because I am your Mother.

00:12:04.519 --> 00:12:07.439
But you should be sensible what to ask Me,
how far to go.

00:12:07.439 --> 00:12:09.769
This is the biggest maryada you have to learn.

00:12:09.769 --> 00:12:12.690
Suddenly you will come, "Mother, should I
sit here?"

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:13.740
What do I say?

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:16.610
Should I make this gentleman sit here?

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:17.610
What should I say?

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:18.610
All right.

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:22.209
You yourself should not ask such a question.

00:12:22.209 --> 00:12:26.139
Because sometimes you give undue importance
to somebody, who is "my brother," who is "my

00:12:26.139 --> 00:12:29.790
sister" -something - and make that person
sit on My head.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:33.050
Sometimes you telephone to Me, "Mother, she
would like to talk to You."

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:34.270
Who is she?

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:35.270
Is she all right?

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:37.300
Should we take her to Mother?

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.920
Is she capable of talking to Mother?

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.510
What is her condition?

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:43.649
Will she trouble Mother?

00:12:43.649 --> 00:12:45.279
Nobody thinks about it.

00:12:45.279 --> 00:12:51.019
So you must first establish your relationship
with Me of proper understanding that you should

00:12:51.019 --> 00:12:52.950
not try to trouble Me.

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:57.529
But this is something is not yet in My hands.

00:12:57.529 --> 00:13:01.180
I think because people do not understand what
they are doing.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:05.129
So first try to see that you don't try to
take advantage of Me.

00:13:05.129 --> 00:13:10.889
And secondly, don't try to bring people to
Me who do not deserve it.

00:13:10.889 --> 00:13:13.170
There is no need to waste My time with them.

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:20.209
I have so much things to be done, so many
ideas to be formulated.

00:13:20.209 --> 00:13:21.260
I have to work so hard.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:26.439
You know, I am working harder than any one
of you, those who are doing Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:26.439 --> 00:13:31.060
And at this age, if you try to trouble Me
like that, I don't know how to tell you that

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.060
don't you trouble Me.

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:35.069
In the presence of the person you will come,
you will bring the person on My head, "Oh,

00:13:35.069 --> 00:13:38.389
that person has come from Timbuktu, and I
have brought her."

00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:39.910
Just you do it.

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:41.990
It is aggressiveness only.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:43.610
Please don't try to do that.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.370
This is a wrong thing to do.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:49.759
So the maryadas are to be established first
with Me, that understand that you should not

00:13:49.759 --> 00:13:53.160
try to trouble Me at all like this.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:58.189
Secondly, you must try to please Me by being
good people.

00:13:58.189 --> 00:14:02.259
I hear that somebody is trying to be very
egoistical.

00:14:02.259 --> 00:14:06.519
He doesn't even put on My tapes, he just gives
his own lectures.

00:14:06.519 --> 00:14:08.500
This kind of a thing is very surprising.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.329
How can people do like that?

00:14:10.329 --> 00:14:12.600
Try to bring down your egos, super egos.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.920
You must learn to please Me, Prasanna bhava
He Devi, Prasanna bhava.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:18.620
(Note: Sanskrit meaning "the Goddess is to
be pleased by Her devotees") If you cannot

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.420
make the Devi Prasanna ( pleased), what will
be your achievement?

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.970
As Rustom says, I am Mahamaya.

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:28.560
All right, but don't you know that I am that?

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.100
So try to keep to it.

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:35.860
And keep that understanding that if you have
to grow, we must have proper relationship

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:36.860
with Mother.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:39.529
And we must understand what will displease
Her the most.

00:14:39.529 --> 00:14:42.329
"Am I pleasing Her by doing this?"

00:14:42.329 --> 00:14:44.999
But if you force Me, "If it pleases You, we'll
do."

00:14:44.999 --> 00:14:46.370
Then what am I to say?

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:48.230
"All right, go ahead."

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:51.220
If it pleases Me I'll just spontaneously say,
"ll right, it pleases Me.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:52.220
Go ahead do it."

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:57.199
Like that, so many things are there that people
just try to force on Me and I say "Yes."

00:14:57.199 --> 00:15:02.889
But I am very cunning and clever in that,
because I tell in a way that you should realize

00:15:02.889 --> 00:15:04.420
that it is not joy giving.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.170
All right, whatever it is.

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:12.720
Now the second thing is that the maryadas
of relationships between you is relationship

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.059
of pure love, of purity.

00:15:15.059 --> 00:15:20.759
Unless and until you develop pure relationships,
you are going to be ruined.

00:15:20.759 --> 00:15:24.270
See, this finger has to have pure relationship
with this hand.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:30.930
Supposing if this finger has some dirty feelings
about this hand, it may dirty it, it may spoil

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:31.930
it.

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:36.529
In the same way, we should have extremely
pure relationships with each other.

00:15:36.529 --> 00:15:42.709
Means, we should try to give our heart to
another person without any lust or greed in

00:15:42.709 --> 00:15:44.180
it, that we should try to do.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.779
Try to help each other.

00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:51.550
I find when they feel in a lusty way, or a
greedy way attached to others - this is not

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:55.529
for the Sahaja Yogis, but non Sahaja Yogis
- they get so much interested in that person.

00:15:55.529 --> 00:15:57.009
It's a very baser way of attachment.

00:15:57.009 --> 00:16:02.529
But in Sahaja Yoga, your attachment is with
your Spirit, with your Atma.

00:16:02.529 --> 00:16:06.040
And Atma is the purest form of our being.

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.579
We have to keep it absolutely pure.

00:16:08.579 --> 00:16:13.680
And then the enjoyment is higher than any
romance, any marriage, any worldly thing.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.129
It's the highest and the top-most.

00:16:16.129 --> 00:16:17.860
First achieve that.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.570
First of all you should arise and achieve
that.

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:22.180
Achieve that purity.

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.470
That is very important.

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:31.170
Now the relationship between the men and women:
have told you that you should not try to enter

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:34.300
into any bedrooms where the ladies are.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.300
It's not proper.

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.689
Nor the women should enter into men's thing.

00:16:36.689 --> 00:16:39.100
But it is very common.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.930
Women should not behave in the way other women
behave.

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:48.690
Like, I was told in a wedding in Maharashtra
that the women went and took out all their

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:49.690
clothes.

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:51.119
I mean, that is not England; they got a shock,
you know.

00:16:51.119 --> 00:16:53.899
Some of them lost their appetite for three,
four days.

00:16:53.899 --> 00:16:56.769
They have never seen such women in their lifetime.

00:16:56.769 --> 00:16:59.290
They went and took out their clothes suddenly,
all of them.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.800
I mean, they were shocked, so much shocked
that three, four days they didn't eat their

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.040
food.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.309
So you have no business to shock them also.

00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:11.089
Because if you go to somebody's country, you
must know in what way they live.

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:13.790
It's never done; nobody becomes nude like
that.

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:20.809
And about twenty girls, if suddenly they become
nude, what will happen?

00:17:20.809 --> 00:17:24.819
So the sense of shame must be developed among
men and women.

00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:26.549
It looks nice, it looks beautiful.

00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:32.210
It gives you an additional charm if you have
the sense of shame, a little bashfulness.

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:36.370
See, your Princess of Wales is regarded as
something beautiful.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:37.460
She is bashful.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.730
Her bashfulness is so natural.

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:46.771
That bashfulness is not there, like a - I
don't know what animal does that, but somebody

00:17:46.771 --> 00:17:48.260
who has no shame.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.409
I mean, I just don't know which one is that.

00:17:50.409 --> 00:17:53.010
Everybody has a sense of shame, even animals.

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.720
So why shouldn't we have that sense of shame?

00:17:55.720 --> 00:18:00.870
How to behave towards women, how to be ... Suddenly
there is no need to just ... I have seen one

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:12.760
lady going from England to India, and she
just went and put a big slap on the back of

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.960
Mr. Modi, "Hello Modi, how are you?"

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.450
And Modi got such a shock.

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:24.250
She did not mean, she was innocent, but that's
not the way in Sahaja Yoga we are going to

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:25.250
behave.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:33.140
Like some sort of a debonair or some sort
of a fantastic - what you call - a modern

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.520
woman, you see.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.880
One must understand one must have a sense
of shame.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:43.230
How do you talk, even with Me they will talk
with a hand like that "Mother, You see this

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:44.230
thing is happening."

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:46.620
But there's no need to do all that, you see.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.580
Talk in a way that is gentle and beautiful.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.909
The other day I met a very nice taxi fellow.

00:18:52.909 --> 00:18:55.360
And I tell you, his gestures and things were
so beautiful.

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.360
Immediately I said, "He is a realized soul."

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:01.730
He would not say anything without putting
his hand like this, and with his eyes down

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:02.730
below.

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:04.970
He would not say something like that, nothing
of the kind.

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:07.230
So sweet he was, his whole gesture.

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:08.549
He is an Englishman.

00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:10.200
Brought up and bred here.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.990
Not a single vulgar word he said.

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:16.080
Like one of your players was so stupid.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.460
When Princess Anne went to meet him he said
all kinds of things, you see.

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.779
It's kind of an ego, or stupidity - I don't
know.

00:19:21.779 --> 00:19:25.429
Because, how you talk, how you speak, everything
should be saintly.

00:19:25.429 --> 00:19:28.820
You are saints now, do you realize?

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:30.760
You are all saints.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:35.831
So how you behave with dignity towards each
other, how you respect their dignity, how

00:19:35.831 --> 00:19:38.119
you live, is very important.

00:19:38.119 --> 00:19:43.170
And that you should try to maintain in a way
that looks like a saintly behavior.

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:45.620
You have to be a saint.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:49.840
And that is not difficult for you, to take
to that, that you behave in a manner that

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.500
you are saints.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:56.130
This is very important I must tell you because
I have seen that these maryadas.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:20:09.900
It would be killing, it would be absolutely
killing Sahaja Yoga, if you do not keep your

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:10.950
maryadas.

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:15.210
That is one of the most essential things one
has to know.

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:22.919
I have told you again and again how you dress
up, how you bear yourself up, how you talk,

00:20:22.919 --> 00:20:29.019
how you listen to others more than you talk
yourself, how you become non-aggressive, is

00:20:29.019 --> 00:20:32.730
the best way to impress people and to express
Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:37.309
I tell you, as it is, people have started
saying, "They are very beautiful people, you

00:20:37.309 --> 00:20:39.050
can see they are very beautiful.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.380
You can see they are very different type.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.380
It's something different.

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:43.380
They are something great."

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:44.930
People have started saying that.

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:47.030
But still we lack in certain things.

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:57.840
Like we start going on a plane which is not
suitable to our stature, to our dignity, to

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.380
our position as saints.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:03.290
We are all prophets, and prophets have to
behave like prophets.

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:05.409
They can not behave like cheap-type people.

00:21:05.409 --> 00:21:08.260
So, in that we have to understand the maryadas.

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:12.090
Now the maryada to your leaders also, you
should be respectful.

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:18.809
I have seen that nobody calls any body - even
the children will call somebody, say, elderly

00:21:18.809 --> 00:21:23.210
person also - never they, say, call them uncle
or anything like that.

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:24.679
It's a wrong thing.

00:21:24.679 --> 00:21:31.039
You must teach your children to call elders
by the name as brother or uncle or someone.

00:21:31.039 --> 00:21:33.850
Give some respect to the elders.

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:36.990
But when the leader is also not respected,
what is the question of it?

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:45.019
I have seen little boys calling big, married
people with three, four children, by name.

00:21:45.019 --> 00:21:46.120
That's not our style.

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.120
You should never do it.

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:51.490
I saw this - even My husband's office has
this problem.

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:53.360
Because when I came, you see, they always
called you by name.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:58.000
"Tom"- he's such a big man, he's called as
"Tom", and all that.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000
So C.P.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000
looked at it...

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.179
And we always call them - even the drivers,
we call them by the name "Mister," you see.

00:22:04.179 --> 00:22:06.440
So we could not understand why is it like
this.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:09.100
You see, it being democratic or something
like this.

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:12.570
You see that's how you become demonocratic.

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:14.140
We must respect.

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:19.309
We must respect each other, must call them
by higher names.

00:22:19.309 --> 00:22:23.730
Specially when in a meeting, there are people,
you should call them - each other, even your

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:26.230
friends - by "Mister so and so."

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:27.470
It's all right for Me to call you.

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:33.870
It would look very funny if I call "Mr. Brown"
or "Mr. Reeves" because they are My children,

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:35.510
you see, I am their Mother.

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:41.440
But for you, because you are equal, at least
call them "Mister" and say something in a

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.779
way which is beautiful.

00:22:42.779 --> 00:22:45.900
Like the English language has many words as
"please, thank you."

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:49.140
All these must be used profusely, profusely.

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:51.820
We are going back a little bit.

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:53.880
We are now becoming much more modern.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:23:05.970
That we should give up and become less modern
and more elevating.

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:17.350
Now the whole idea of this maryada is such
that when you have called somebody as a sister

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:21.760
or a brother then it is not only lip service:
You are my sister.

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.880
It is something innate, and very deep.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.080
You have to develop that feeling of a sister.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:33.890
Because that's how your sublimity will go
up, your left Visshuddhi will improve, your

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:35.200
Vishnumaya will be satisfied.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:41.380
If you call somebody a sister, the sisterly
and daughterly relationships, and motherly

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:48.880
relationships, always bring down, you see,
the so-called ego, which is hiding in the

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.159
left Visshuddhi.

00:23:50.159 --> 00:23:53.679
So try to be kind and gentle with the person
whom you call the sister.

00:23:53.679 --> 00:23:57.179
Stand by her, look after her.

00:23:57.179 --> 00:24:03.080
If somebody you call your brother, you have
to pray for his protection, then you must

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:07.590
know that you have a right to ask him for
his protection also.

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:13.170
But you must also give something to him, and
you must try to look after him, welcome him

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:21.029
to your house, and treat him as a part and
parcel of your being, because he is very much

00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:24.910
near to you because he is your brother, and
he's very much closer to you.

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:27.679
But such a brother should not try to dominate
the wife.

00:24:27.679 --> 00:24:29.919
This is the maryada, again.

00:24:29.919 --> 00:24:34.700
Like a brother or somebody is very friendly
with the brother, or a lady is friendly as

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:39.230
a sister, then she should not try to put a
wedge between the husband and wife.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:43.480
That is the worst thing to do, is to put a
wedge between husband and wife.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.540
Anybody who tries that must know that he is
a mean person.

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:49.740
One should never try to put a wedge between
husband and wife.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:53.149
I know there are problems between husband
and wife, I will put them right.

00:24:53.149 --> 00:24:55.389
But you don't try to put any wedge between
them.

00:24:55.389 --> 00:24:57.260
And don't try to create a problem.

00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:01.700
If it is problematic, it is for Me to solve,
not you people don't have to solve.

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.720
And don't interfere with their married life.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.980
Let them be as they are.

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:09.390
I will find out how they are; I will try to
help them.

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:14.220
But it's very wrong to play with their married
life or with their marriage problems, and

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:18.289
suddenly jump on somebody, is a very wrong
thing, which is very common here.

00:25:18.289 --> 00:25:21.950
A woman is in distress, you see, a man will
come to help her.

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:24.820
Even if she is married, he will elope with
her.

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:30.750
This is how he comes to help her in the distress,
to create another distress for her.

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:37.309
So this is how one should understand that
this kind of a cheap heart-giving business,

00:25:37.309 --> 00:25:40.730
and taking business, is not for Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:44.630
In our heart resides the Spirit.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:50.230
We are dignified people, and in that dignity
we have to rise and live with that dignity.

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:57.059
Not to cheaply allow the Spirit to be insulted
or dominated or subjugated to anyone.

00:25:57.059 --> 00:26:04.950
Now the relationship with children also one
should understand.

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:13.360
I have seen some people have a habit of getting
a child very much closer, and pampering them,

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.529
"Oh, this child is this thing.

00:26:15.529 --> 00:26:16.529
Oh, that child..."

00:26:16.529 --> 00:26:21.350
Let the parents handle the child, you just
don't interfere with other's children.

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:23.420
Don't interfere much with them.

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:27.900
If you find any child is such and such, inform
Me, I will cure the child.

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:33.040
But if a child is being spoilt by you, it's
the worst thing to do is to harm that child,

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.590
is to spoil.

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:39.460
Children here are very clever and intelligent,
you must know.

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.520
They are very good at manipulating.

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:44.320
They will, because they are extremely precocious.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.770
They are realized souls; they are born in
this country.

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:48.460
What a combination!

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:52.400
At that time you must be very careful as to
their training.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:58.559
From the first five years all the parents
must be extremely strict with children, extremely

00:26:58.559 --> 00:26:59.559
strict.

00:26:59.559 --> 00:27:04.510
Don't allow them to overpower you or manipulate
you.

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:07.179
It's very important.

00:27:07.179 --> 00:27:11.960
If you allow them to overpower you or to dominate
you, they'll sit on your head.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.549
Tell them not to do like that.

00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:18.019
And one day you will come and say, "Mother,
what to do, these are realized souls and,

00:27:18.019 --> 00:27:19.549
you see, we were looking after them."

00:27:19.549 --> 00:27:20.549
They are not deities.

00:27:20.549 --> 00:27:24.080
They are not deities to be worshipped.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.809
They are only realized souls.

00:27:25.809 --> 00:27:27.520
So keep them at that point.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:30.990
And you are My trustees of those children.

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:33.460
And if you spoil them, it is you who will
he held responsible.

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:38.471
You have no business to spoil the lives of
these children as Sahaja Yogis, and their

00:27:38.471 --> 00:27:40.120
chances of ascent.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:43.360
So if they are born-realized, they are not
deities; this you must understand.

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:48.840
They are not beyond corruption, they are not
beyond all kinds of things.

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:54.380
So this, if you understand this little point,
that dealing with your children you have to

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:55.380
be really strict.

00:27:55.380 --> 00:28:00.660
They must know how to meditate, they must
know how to pray, they must know how to respect;

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:03.450
and all the good things you must teach your
children.

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:05.380
And don't allow them to sit on your head.

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:08.659
Many people have ruined the lives of their
children like this.

00:28:08.659 --> 00:28:13.309
Now will you please see that such child is
brought into proper level?

00:28:13.309 --> 00:28:18.650
If the child is trying to take liberties with
you, and cheeky and does not listen, please

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:24.090
give that child to some other Sahaja Yogi
to look after, whom you think can look after,

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:25.860
and see that the child is put right.

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:30.250
Nip in the bud is the best way, because we
don't want to have children who are spoilt,

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:38.779
who are spoiling other children, nor we want
children who are subjected to such children.

00:28:38.779 --> 00:28:44.610
So, you can have proper children, well-behaved
children, sensible, wise children.

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:51.110
Because they can really be a drag on you,
on Me, on everyone, if you do not properly

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:52.110
bring them up.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:56.259
And they are our liabilities; we have to look
after them.

00:28:56.259 --> 00:29:02.360
So the relationship between the father and
children, mother and children, is important.

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.909
Actually the mother should look after the
child much more.

00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:06.630
And the child must respect.

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:09.179
Father should never scold the mother in the
presence of the child.

00:29:09.179 --> 00:29:13.210
That's one thing one must understand, that
if the father starts scolding the mother in

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:17.190
the presence of the child, the child will
have no respect for the mother.

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:21.019
But the respect must be maintained, because
if the wife respects the husband, then the

00:29:21.019 --> 00:29:24.710
child will know how to respect her and the
husband too.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:27.750
So the whole thing is built up like that.

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:31.250
Is a kind of a pattern for children to follow.

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:36.429
One should not try to dominate the husband,
at least in the presence of children.

00:29:36.429 --> 00:29:38.799
That's very wrong.

00:29:38.799 --> 00:29:42.620
Because then the children learn that trick
and they start dominating you.

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:44.460
So it flows from you to children.

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:49.230
So try to see that if you have to do anything
then you do it yourself.

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:55.220
And respect the husband and in a way that
is very obvious to the child that the father

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:56.769
is respected by mother.

00:29:56.769 --> 00:29:59.150
And they are just like monkeys.

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:01.289
The way you behave, they behave.

00:30:01.289 --> 00:30:05.640
So you allow them to behave in a particular
manner, they will behave that way.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.679
But if you put a good pattern of behavior,
they will imbibe it.

00:30:07.679 --> 00:30:10.790
The other day I was thinking, how Indian children
are so obedient, so sensible.

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:11.830
They will never ask for it.

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:12.870
"I want this, I want that."

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:13.870
They never manipulate.

00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:14.870
What happens?

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:15.870
What happens, how do they do it?

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:25.970
The reason is, I think, the good pattern in
the house.

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:29.470
Everybody knows whom to respect, how to respect,
how to behave.

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:35.480
The relationship in Sahaja Yoga has to be
even more than this, much more subtler.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:41.850
For example, if - this I have said before
also - if we are in a room, try to give another

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:44.950
person always, try to do for them.

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:51.260
If you have to pay, better pay yourself, not
that wait for another person.

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:52.620
Try to do it yourself.

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:53.770
Run forward to do it.

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:57.780
You see, if someone is carrying the luggage,
you run, you do it.

00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:59.929
That is the way a Sahaja Yogi should be.

00:30:59.929 --> 00:31:01.019
Mostly, children are like that.

00:31:01.019 --> 00:31:03.649
They will say, "I'll get it, I'll do it, I'll
receive it."

00:31:03.649 --> 00:31:08.909
May be ego, you might call it, but whatever
it is, but that is the sign you all have to

00:31:08.909 --> 00:31:17.200
achieve by organizing a proper type of an
image for the whole society.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.930
That if somebody needs something, you run.

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:19.930
"You want water?

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:20.930
All right...

00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:21.930
You want this thing?

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:22.930
You take mine."

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:23.930
Food also - same thing.

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:26.750
First let others have, not that you should
first have anything.

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:33.549
How you eat your food is very important, everything
is very important for the children to see,

00:31:33.549 --> 00:31:35.710
and to behave like that.

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:42.070
In money matters also, I have seen that people
should be very, very sensible and should have

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:44.389
proper maryadas.

00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:48.669
Now with Me, whatever maryadas you want to
keep, you must understand.

00:31:48.669 --> 00:31:51.289
It is very embarrassing to talk about it.

00:31:51.289 --> 00:31:57.820
But so far, as you know, I had to shell out
lot of money to manage many funds, many things.

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:06.740
And last time also we had many people who
came to eat, doesn't matter.

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:17.960
At the time now, when we are talking about
maryadas, we must know that, in any case,

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:24.379
Mother should not be made to pay any more.

00:32:24.379 --> 00:32:28.620
Because we are so many, we should try to manage,
if possible.

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:33.610
Like yesterday, I had a person from BBC, and
he said, "It is wrong of You not to take any

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:34.610
money from them."

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:36.080
I said, "Where is the money?

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:38.590
No question of taking, I have to pay Myself."

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:43.330
I said, "It is so invaluable that how can
you charge for it?

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:46.070
You cannot charge for it, it is very invaluable.

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:49.190
The Spirit is very invaluable, and you cannot
charge for it."

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:50.289
So he was insisting.

00:32:50.289 --> 00:32:53.470
I mean, he took half an hour on this subject
only.

00:32:53.470 --> 00:33:00.600
He said, "This Anglo-Saxon brain won't understand
unless and until You make it a little more

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:01.710
money-oriented or something."

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:03.210
I said, "I cannot.

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:05.899
Tell me how much is to be paid."

00:33:05.899 --> 00:33:08.120
Just to shut him down, I said, "What about
Christ?

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.580
How much money did He take?

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:14.799
By God's grace I am quite well off and I really
don't need either.

00:33:14.799 --> 00:33:17.899
But He needed, still He never took any money
from anyone."

00:33:17.899 --> 00:33:19.779
Then he kept quiet.

00:33:19.779 --> 00:33:27.520
But this is what it is, you see, that people
think that you are getting it easy, cheap

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:32.570
and that's why you want to take advantage,
which is wrong.

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:34.380
You must respect.

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:42.450
You must respect and understand that it is
never good to take any advantage of it.

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:48.559
On the contrary, whenever it is possible you
should try to do whatever is possible for

00:33:48.559 --> 00:33:49.559
Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:49.559 --> 00:33:51.059
It's very important.

00:33:51.059 --> 00:33:52.940
Try to surrender.

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:55.129
Not that I will take any money from you, you
know that.

00:33:55.129 --> 00:33:56.990
I don't want any money or anything.

00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:59.990
But surrender yourself absolutely to Sahaja
Yoga.

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:04.740
That is the best way people have risen and
have done so well.

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:15.230
Now the relationship among yourselves, among
different groups, among different nations:

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:17.950
we should try to help people.

00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:23.360
Supposing there is a couple now, wants to
go to India to get married.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.580
Now if they don't have money, of course I
am there.

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.950
I said, "All right, they need not pay any
money, I'll pay for them."

00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:38.710
But Warren has put down his foot, he says,
"Why not the people, or the center, help them

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:40.290
out, for the time being?"

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:45.400
You see because now, supposing they have helped
somebody - he had no money, he went to India,

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:49.900
he got married and then he got lost, you see,
he misbehaved, in the sense that he doesn't

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:55.210
talk to anyone, he thinks no end of himself,
then he started behaving in a funny manner.

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:59.320
So a kind of a feeling came into their mind
that "Why should we do it?

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:02.160
If you do it for somebody, then he behaves
like that.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.180
If you try to help somebody..."

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:08.940
Is this a natural reaction that if you try
to do something for someone then people try

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:09.940
to misbehave?

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:11.820
That's not so.

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:15.910
Must be one person has done it, that doesn't
mean that everybody has done it.

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:16.910
That's what it is.

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:22.780
They say that a kind of a barrier is built
in a person who is helped by us, and his ego

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:26.700
is challenged, and he tries to behave in a
manner which was never known before.

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:31.630
And he starts behaving in such a funny manner
that he doesn't talk to anyone, he keeps out

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:34.350
and he becomes mad with his ego.

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:35.630
So his ego is hurt.

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:37.230
There's nothing to feel hurt.

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:41.910
Because if you have no money and if it is
one part and one body, if somebody's helping

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:42.970
you out, doesn't matter.

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:45.480
You can help, when you are well off, to somebody
else.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.400
But when it comes to you, you give up.

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:53.270
So this is a very absurd type of a behavior
of one individual, or two or three, or maybe

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:54.270
five or ten.

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:55.270
Doesn't matter.

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:57.300
But still we must not forget that we have
to help.

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.650
We have to help as many as possible.

00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:03.260
And we must try to do whatever is possible
for us, for others.

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:04.260
This is important.

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:07.880
If we cannot do for a group, like Sahaja Yogis,
whom are we going to help?

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:09.540
So we have to give that help.

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:14.990
Now in Sahaja Yoga itself, on the subtle basis
we should not try to judge anybody's vibrations.

00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:19.200
It is very common in people, "Oh, you are
caught up on your Agnya.

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.220
Oh, you have got this wrong, let me clear
you out.

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:22.290
You sit down."

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:26.530
Morning till evening, without meditating,
they are clearing each other's chakras and

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:27.770
catching on themselves.

00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:29.840
It's an absolutely wrong idea.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:33.680
Everybody, individually, should sit before
the photograph, get the vibrations, every

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.700
morning, there should be a discipline.

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:39.600
You must know that the system of Sahaja Yoga
today has worked out this way that I have

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:42.360
given you Realization just to say that "Let
your light be enlightened."

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:48.790
Now you have to see your lamp, if it is clean
or not - only possible when the light is enlightened.

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:52.070
See your lamp, if it is enlightened or not.

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:55.890
See, if somebody is over-aggressive, then
it's all right, you make a joint attack on

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:57.660
that person, and tell-off that person.

00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:59.810
Or there are leaders who will do it.

00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:01.930
But everybody should not judge others.

00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:05.550
You better judge yourself, cleanse yourself,
look after yourself.

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:08.120
And also try to see how your lamp is.

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.120
Is it clean?

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:12.100
Mother has given us the light to see; and
why not see?

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:16.240
So if you work it out on these lines, you'll
go very fast.

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:19.120
And you have to, now, perfect yourself.

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:21.250
We have so many Sahaja Yogis.

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:22.750
But how many are perfect?

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:23.880
This is the point.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.830
Now your relationship to Sahaja Yoga is also
very important.

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:29.100
There's a maryada about it very much.

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:32.300
Sahaja Yoga should not be taken for granted.

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:36.180
Anybody who thinks he has got Realization
and now he is sitting on top of the world

00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:37.630
- is not so.

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:39.751
You must work it out, you have to have discipline.

00:37:39.751 --> 00:37:46.540
The same gentleman, the BBC fellow, was saying
that it was before, for years together, you

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:55.120
had to live in celibacy and wash the feet
and sweep steps of the temple and do all kinds

00:37:55.120 --> 00:38:00.160
of things, work hard, do this, do that - and
then they would raise it to one chakra.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:04.870
I said, "Now we do it the other way round."

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:08.850
First build the dome and then the foundation.

00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:11.750
Sahaja Yoga is like that.

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:15.340
So that with the dome you understand, you
are protected, you are looked after.

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.110
But people take it for granted, like.

00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:18.290
"Mother will do it.

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:19.370
Leave it to Mother."

00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:21.490
No, it is not so.

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:23.060
You are My hands.

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:25.890
Supposing My hands have to lift this, I should
say that Nirmala will do it?

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:26.890
Now, which is Nirmala?

00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:29.760
These hands are the Nirmala at this point.

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:32.430
So, many people drift like that.

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:38.150
So, to Sahaja Yoga also, your attitude should
be of respect.

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:43.590
You should not try to put yourself into bandhan
before others, you should not try to do these

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:47.030
things; but in a dignified way you must respect
Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:51.850
And foremost of all, to Sahaja Yoga your relationship
should be that you should know Sahaja Yoga,

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:52.850
what it is.

00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:57.810
Otherwise every time if you have to talk about
Sahaja, Gavin must come, or somebody.

00:38:57.810 --> 00:38:58.810
Why?

00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:02.400
Gavin did not know a word about Sahaja Yoga,
he did not know a word about Indian mythology,

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:05.660
he did not know anything, he did not know
what Realization is.

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:08.320
He studied, he's even studying Sanskrit.

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.020
Like many of you have done it.

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:13.690
But all of you, one and all, should become
a big pandit.

00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:16.990
But you get lost in your marriage problems.

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:18.730
Then your children's problems.

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:20.270
Then "my mother," then "my sister."

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:22.750
I mean, it will take too much time for you.

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:25.470
First of all you should see, "I am a Sahaja
Yogi.

00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:26.760
Let me get to work."

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.580
And it creates problems for us also.

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:31.940
Because your wife will sue you, your children
will come round, this, that.

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:35.010
You should say, "I have nothing to do, I am
going to study Sahaja Yoga."

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:41.920
I was surprised that many people have taken
Advent just like as a bible, just as a bible.

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:42.920
They never read it.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:48.910
I was surprised that some people do not know
what I have written in the Bible.

00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:52.680
So it is like the Jews, you see, having a
Golden Bible tied up here.

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:56.240
They keep The Advent in a very good cover
near the photograph, worship it - finished.

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:57.240
Then the knowledge goes into them.

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.240
You must read some chapters at least of Advent,
if not anything else.

00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.240
There are so many books you can read; I have
told you.

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.240
Try to make your own library.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.240
Try to improve in it.

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.240
Everybody must try to get perfection - perfectionism.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.240
You should never be a liability on Sahaja
Yoga, but a great asset of Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.240
That's what everybody should try to be.

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.240
That, your problems I will solve.

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:06.240
But you solve your ascent.

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:07.240
That is very important.

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.240
You must ascend.

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:09.240
Otherwise, whatever problems I solve, you
get into another problem, then you get into

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.240
another problem.

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:11.240
Now the relationship - say you have an ashram;
somebody has bought it.

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:12.240
Now, nobody should think that "This is my
house."

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.240
Now this is the best way to get out of this
idea of possession.

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:14.240
Because then I trouble you.

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:15.240
That's the place where Mahamaya plays.

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:16.240
If you say, "This is my house," then you will
have it.

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:17.240
And you will have it forever.

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.240
So such things you should never develop, the
feeling that "this (is my house)."

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:19.240
Now I have seen people, they go into an ashram,
and then they think this is their house.

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.240
They live there.

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.240
They manipulate all the money that they save
and this and that, and develop this, want

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:22.240
to make everything comfortable.

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.240
They never think, "This is not my ashram;
I am doing it because I am a Sahaja Yogi.

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:24.240
This is the Ashram of Mother.

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.240
I have to do it."

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:26.240
But that detachment is not there.

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:27.240
Not at all a detachment.

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:28.240
And it is something surprising, that if you
have to go to Himalayas and make an insurance

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:29.240
policy, then what's the use of coming to Sahaja
Yoga?

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:30.240
It is as absurd as that.

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:31.240
We are writing two insurance policies, that
"I have gone to Himalayas.

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.240
When I die, give my property to this one.

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.240
If I don't die, I will come back after that."

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:34.240
And nicely packing up in a nice plastic bag
so that ice doesn't spoil it.

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.240
It's as absurd as that.

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:36.240
So you should not have anything.

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.240
Now some people have a habit, "Oh, I'll get
a house for myself.

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.240
Get my wife there, children there."

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.240
Finished.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.240
All such people should, for a change, leave
their houses, come to ashram, put some other

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.240
people in their house.

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.240
Because they are getting attached, you see.

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.240
How will you get detached?

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.240
Is there any way out?

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.240
Because that is very important in Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.240
Unless and until you are detached, you cannot
ascend.

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.240
Supposing you have all the tentacles down
here on the Mother Earth, and you say, "Let

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.240
this plane fly," how will it go?

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:49.240
So those people who have houses of their own,
or buildings of their own or anything - flats

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:50.240
- should give up their houses.

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:51.240
Not to be that comfortable.

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.240
Get out of it.

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.240
Ask some other people to shift, and you shift
to the ashram.

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:54.240
Go on shifting, training your mind to shift,
to live with everyone, to be able to share

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.240
and to do things.

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:56.240
I have changed forty houses after My marriage,
you can imagine.

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:57.240
And the kind of a house I have to carry on
with is a very multi-purpose house.

00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:58.240
And I have changed, so far, forty houses,
and if I change now this house, it will be

00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:59.240
the forty-first.

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:00.240
You can imagine, I have been married forty
years and forty houses I have changed.

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.240
So the relationship of purity must be understood,
in everything.

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:02.240
Is it pure relationship?

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.240
Am I living in this ashram in pure relationship?

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:04.240
Because this is the house that is giving me
comfort, that's why I am living in this house;

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:05.240
or am I just living here, just because it's
an abode - I am here today, and I will be

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:06.240
there tomorrow?

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.240
You will be amazed, you will enjoy every part
of life.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:08.240
As soon as you are attached, you are doomed.

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.240
It's a headache to be attached to someone.

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.240
Then you hanker.

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.240
"My wife has not arrived.

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:12.240
Oh God, what to do now?

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:13.240
I must telephone to her, get her here."

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:14.240
But if you are detached about it she'll come
in time.

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.240
Not only that, but you will enjoy her company.

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:16.240
Otherwise you'll shout at her, "Why didn't
you come in time?

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.240
I was waiting for you."

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.240
Then why were you waiting to scold her, and
shout at her and spoil all the relationship?

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.240
Just see, the absurdity of the whole thing
is the attachment.

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.240
You should get completely detached about everything,
and you will enjoy, just enjoy.

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.240
But in that also, one has to judge.

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.240
You are really enjoying or you are just making
a drama out of it?

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:23.240
Try to be sincere.

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:24.240
Purity is brought forth by sincerity.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.240
If you are not sincere to yourself and to
others, you can not be pure.

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:26.240
And purity is the main thing you have to achieve
in Sahaja Yoga, apart from the unity, which

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:27.240
I have given you.

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.240
But if you do not use this unity for purity
- no use.

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.240
So this light should give you complete wisdom
that you enjoy a pure, good life.

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:30.240
You are married.

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.240
All right, you have life of enjoyment with
your wife - that I have already described

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:32.240
to you.

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:33.240
And with your wife how to behave also, I have
described to you many a times, or with your

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.240
husband.

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.240
But when it comes to others, you should have
absolutely pure relationship of no exploitation.

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:36.240
Even there are flirting exploitations - as
the same as money exploitations.

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.240
Here if you exploit somebody by money it's
called a "thug".

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:38.240
But flirting is not called anything.

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:39.240
I think that is a much worse crime, according
to Christ.

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:40.240
So you have to be careful on this point, and
understand that relationship with each other

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:41.240
has to be pure.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.240
Now there are people who have, say, horrible
wives or horrible husbands.

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:43.240
I don't mind, they can give them up.

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:44.240
If they are absolutely impossible, if they
are spoiling their purity, if they are torturing

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:45.240
their lives, then the best is to get rid of
them.

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.240
I don't mind.

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.240
Because if they are so bad that you cannot
use them - just like this body, if it is so

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:48.240
bad, it's better to give up and die.

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:49.240
So that let that relationship die out.

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.240
But that death should come to you as a very
forceful help; otherwise, after that, if you

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.240
become a nervous personality, what's the use?

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:52.240
So what you have to do after such a thing
has happened - that you have given up such

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.240
a relationship - then, if you have to go to
courts and all that, you should give up Sahaja

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:54.240
Yoga for the time being.

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.240
Solve your problems.

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:56.240
Solve your court problems, everything, then
come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:57.240
We do not want to get involved into this kind
of a thing at all, that we have broken any

00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:58.240
family or anything.

00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.240
If you cannot carry on with a wife, not that
Sahaja Yoga should be an excuse.

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.240
Because you can not carry on with her, you
should have this thing - go out of Sahaja

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:01.240
Yoga, do what you like with your wife, finish
it off once for all.

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:02.240
And you should tell her, "I am no more a Sahaja
Yogi."

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.240
Get it out, and then come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:04.240
But by coming to Sahaja Yoga you will be really
troubling Me too much.

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:05.240
So I have to make a humble request to you,
that if you have any a such problem, do not

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.240
allow any child who is younger than a proper
age - sixteen years - to be kept in the ashram

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.240
without taking a full permission, written
permission from the parents.

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:08.240
Or a wife who has made problems with the husband,
should not be allowed to come and stay in

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:09.240
the ashram with the children unless and until
it is resolved.

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.240
We are not responsible for all kinds of problems.

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.240
Then people who are sick or mentally deranged
should not be kept in the ashram.

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:12.240
That is also quite a sympathetic attitude
of so many Sahaja Yogis.

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.240
Ashram is for the best people, not for the
lunatics.

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:14.240
So please do not get such people who are no
good.

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.240
We do not want such people to come in the
ashram who are going to ruin the reputation

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.240
of the ashram.

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.240
So coming to the relationship of Vishnumaya,
is that Vishnumaya is the One Who is the sister,

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.240
sister of Shri Krishna.

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:19.240
She is the One Who announced the coming of
Shri Krishna.

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:20.240
She is the One Who sacrificed Her life to
save Shri Krishna's life.

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:21.240
Vishnumaya is the One Which surrounds Shri
Krishna; and She was born as Draupadi Who,

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:22.240
you know, was later on humiliated by Duryodhana,
and it was Shri Krishna Who came and helped

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:23.240
Her.

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.240
So it's a very sweet relationship of purity,
of help.

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.240
A very delicate relationship is to be maintained
of a brother and a sister.

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:26.240
And that is a special relationship today.

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:27.240
Those who want to tie the Rakhis to a sister
should tie today before Me, it will be a good

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:28.240
idea.

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:29.240
It is a greater relationship than any other
relationship.

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:30.240
Because here somebody is your own sister,
is all right.

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:31.240
But if she is not your own sister you should
know that you all are born of one Mother.

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:32.240
So the brother and sister relationship should
be all right.

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.240
In that also one should not have preferences
- because some would like to have a rich sister,

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:34.240
or some sort of a nonsense like that.

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:35.240
Or somebody would like to have the most miserable
one.

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:36.240
This is all the maya.

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.240
But a relationship with a person with whom
you would like to be happy, you should tie

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:38.240
the rakhi.

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.240
And if there is anybody left out, you should
not try to do that.

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.240
So anybody who is listening, I would say that
best thing would be to have your lucky dips.

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.240
I think for people, something like that could
be done so that they choose their sisters

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.240
and tie the things.

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:43.240
Which ever way you like you choose it.

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.240
But I have got some nice rakhis for you, that
should be done today.

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.240
And I will be very happy.

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:46.240
And then we'll do this little havana for the
Vishnumaya.

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:47.240
May God bless you.

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:48.240
TIE THE RAKHI AND HAVAN:

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:49.240
(Informal conversation with yogis about who
will live in which ashrams)

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:50.240
This house has too much right-side.

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:51.240
[Inaudible] It's a very right-sided house,
it's very right-sided.

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:52.240
I don't know; you have to, little bit, fill
with some left-sided [inaudible].

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:53.240
absolutely right-sided.

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:54.240
There is one more thing I have to tell, which
he had asked Me to talk to you.

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.240
I don't know if you are interested, but they
are showing some sort of a program at seven

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:56.240
o'clock on Saturday.

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:57.240
They are showing some program of revelation,
how people see lights, things like that.

00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:58.240
Sahaja Yogis must know why these things happen.

00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:59.240
Like, one gentleman suddenly felt a flash.

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:00.240
He went to a lady and she was a widow lady,
her husband had died in climbing, and he himself

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.240
used to climb a lot with him.

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:02.240
And the husband died, so he went to get the
lady, the widow.

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:03.240
And she was telling all the stories, and he
felt very sad about it, and suddenly - he

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.240
didn't like the way she was telling the stories,
I think - and suddenly he felt a flash on

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:05.240
his head, of light.

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:06.240
And then he felt tremendous compassion for
her.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:07.240
What must have happened, can you tell?

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:08.240
No, I'll tell you what must have happened:
the Kundalini must have risen.

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.240
He used to climb and do all these right-sided
business, so it must have spread - one possibility

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:10.240
- on the right side.

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.240
It could have been that, without Kundalini
awakening also, the sympathetic might have

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:12.240
broken its way to the right because he's too
much right-sided and all that.

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:13.240
And ultimately with these things, he might
have broken himself to the right and gone

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:14.240
to the right most probably.

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.240
But by going too much to the right, you see,
he must have felt the pull of the left, because

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:16.240
right is too much pulled out, then you sink
to the left.

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:17.240
And that's how he must have felt the compassion
for the lady.

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:18.240
But could be also with Kundalini.

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.240
With some people it can happen that Kundalini,
at the time of such tension and problems,

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:20.240
sometimes rises and tries to... because It's
a parasympathetic thing.

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.240
Might rise and just soothes the person, at
that point.

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:22.240
But most probably, I think, it is the sympathetic
activity which he was doing, and suddenly

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:23.240
the whole thing flashed into the right, then
he went to the left.

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.240
Another lady who did some dirty act on the
stage, some filthy act, and she was not very

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:25.240
happy with it.

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:26.240
Though it was indecent, she had to do it.

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:27.240
And she did that on the stage, and after that
she was feeling very sad, and then suddenly

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:28.240
she felt a lot of fire in her stomach, tremendous
heat in her stomach.

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:29.240
And then in the morning, when she looked in
the mirror, she felt her eyes were all heated

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:30.240
up, and heat was coming out of her eyes, when
she looked at her eyes she felt very sad about

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:31.240
it, and all her body was frozen.

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:32.240
And this is the one where, I think, is Shri
Ganesha's anger, that He showed Himself as

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:33.240
the Mooladhara heat, and from the eyes Christ,
His heat was coming.

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:34.240
And because the heat was all consumed in those
chakras the rest of the body was heat.

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.240
One fellow has an experience that from his
back he gets cool breeze coming out, but not

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:36.240
from his head, because, I think, should be
an Agnya bhoot was blocked, so he's just emitting

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.240
from his back only, and the Kundalini is trying
to come out.

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.240
(With) some people, the Kundalini will rise,
definitely.

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:39.240
The reason is this: that so many now of you
have got Realization.

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:40.240
And I have told you that once a particular
number of people gets it people will get the

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:41.240
experiences.

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:42.240
But getting the experience is a very vague
thing.

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:43.240
They are just vague; they do not know what
it is.

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:44.240
So it may be also that hundred monkey syndrome
has started and that people are getting this

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:45.240
Kundalini awakening within themselves.

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:46.240
Because suddenly so many revelations are coming
forward.

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:47.240
[Shri Mataji asks for the center leaders to
come and perform the Havan]

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:48.240
Let this fire light go into your Left Vishuddhi
and cleanse it completely, burn off all baddha.

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.240
May God bless you

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.240
So we had this complete, this Vishnumaya where
we have never done before.

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:51.240
And Left Vishuddhi has been the biggest problem
of this country - feeling guilty and all that.

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:52.240
So now I'm sure the people will come out of
it, and will try to show everyone not with

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:53.240
ego but with complete balanced mind, the dignity
of Sahaja Yogis.

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.240
May God bless you

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.240
Now, we have decided not to have too many
marriages in Switzerland, because, as you

00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:56.240
see now, we cannot go up to that point where
we can have marriages.

00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.240
It's all full of snow, you cannot have fire,
you cannot have all the arrangements.

00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:58.240
Even a garland of flowers may cost you fifty
pounds.

00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.240
And it's not going to be cheaper marriage,
in the sense that everything is so expensive,

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:00.240
even if you find out in the market.

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.240
Now I have to make a request to you people:
those who want to get married in Switzerland

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:02.240
should be mostly the people who want to remarry,
or those people who can not at all afford

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:03.240
to go to India.

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.240
But try to help the people who do not have
enough to go to India, that they get married

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:05.240
in India.

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:06.240
It's much easier, it's much [inaudible], much
more simple.

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:07.240
All right?

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:08.240
So, if you understand that, if you can go
to India and if you have leave, then do it.

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:09.240
It's better to do it there.

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:10.240
And you need not jump...They say that [Indian
saying], means a person who is very anxious

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:11.240
to get married, doesn't even raise the head-dress
here, he ties upon his knee.

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:12.240
So one should not be that much excited.

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:13.240
Take a very sensible view of the whole thing,
those who want to get married.

00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:14.240
And we have decided on the people who could
marry in Switzerland.

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:15.240
So those who have no money or something, apart
from this you should try to help them if possible,

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:16.240
every way possible.

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.240
I will also try to help.

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:18.240
Now another thing I have to say is that you
all have to send some money for My travel,

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:19.240
because I have to travel now.

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.240
We have been traveling throughout England,
again I have to travel; and if there is no

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:21.240
travel money, you know who has to pay the
amount.

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:22.240
But the people will be again replacing the
money of the travel, which will again be there

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.240
ready for other travel.

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:24.240
As it is, for India and all that, you don't
have to pay.

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:25.240
But, I think that, if you decide that I have
to travel, that you should pay for My traveling,

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:26.240
then it is better that you should send some
money for the traveling.

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:27.240
We have been all over the country and, so
far, nobody has paid anything for travel.

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:28.240
So please try to send the traveling money
to Gavin Brown, and all the money that you

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:29.240
want to contribute to him and the travel.

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:30.240
Now another one, we have decided now to keep
the emergency money.

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:31.240
Plus, if you people donate more than the travel
money, or the money you want to donate for

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:32.240
the programs and all that, should be in the
emergency money.

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:33.240
It can be used for other things like mailing,
for photography or any kind of such expenses

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.240
where you have to have a hall - all these
things.

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:35.240
Certain people, like Isle of Wight people
have sent five-hundred pounds for the program,

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:36.240
within three persons it was too much so I
decided to pay half of it to them back to

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.240
the travel money.

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:38.240
Then we have to buy one tape recorder which
will cost about sixteen hundred, fifty in

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:39.240
the market, for which we have money - not
the whole but we have lot of it - and we have

00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:40.240
to buy that also.

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:41.240
So the only now money left with us is emergency
money and the travel money.

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.240
Out of it, the travel money is very limited.

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.240
If I have to travel, then either I pay and
then we reimburse, or something like happens.

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.240
It's a big problem, because how to adjust
it and how to do it?

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:45.240
So keep it free from all these problems.

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.240
If you people donate some money for the travel
money to Gavin Brown, it will be easier, which

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:47.240
will be again replaced by the people.

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:48.240
But just now the traveling is important, for
which you have to pay.

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:49.240
And the rest of it, just now, is that we don't
have to pay much for anything else.

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:50.240
So that all the money should transfer to the
travel money - for the time being, only for

00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:50.243
the time being.
