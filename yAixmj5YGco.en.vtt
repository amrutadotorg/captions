00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.892
1984-0708 Public Program 3 at Ilford Town Hall. Ilford (England), To Know The Truth PP 3

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:08.892
Let’s have our realization now all of us, but I don’t promise as I said it’s your own lookout.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.892
If you believe in our, according to Indian thing if you believe, according to our former karmas

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.892
according to our previous things that we get Atma Sakshatkar, because it’s the highest to have.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.892
So let’s see what happens. And also My compassion, My love,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.892
My desire that you all should get your realisation and establish it

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.892
and become powerful Sahaja yogis and understand it fully.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.892
Now those who are here have to follow what I say,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.892
is very simple method by which you help yourself. As I said you are your own guru

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.892
and on different chakras we have to work it out and it works.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.892
So please take out your shoes for one reason, that the Mother Earth helps us

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.892
to sort of earth some of the problems that have come from the Mother Earth.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.892
Now, you have to keep your eyes shut throughout, not to open your eyes.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.892
The reasons are many but one of them is that the centre of Agnya,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.892
which is placed between the pituitary and the pineal body, is a very important centre.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.892
It is the gate and it doesn’t open if your eyes are open outside just now.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.892
So please keep your eyes shut till then and maybe the kundalini may not also rise.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.892
The whole attitude should be that I should get my realization. You’re not going to lose anything,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.892
I don’t take any money, nothing of the kind, and there is nothing to gain out of it anyway.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.892
So just you have to gain something out of it so, in a humble way,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.892
you have to sit down and put your hands on your lap.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.892
Those people who have come for the first time, or are standing there, can come forward here

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.892
and sit down and the Sahaja yogis should give them places.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.892
Sahaja yogis should never take the first places, I would request, it would be a good idea.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:54.892
All right, just try to sit on the side if possible, those who have come for the first time.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:04:16.892
[ASIDE ABOUT A PARKED CAR]

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.892
Now, as I told you, you don’t have to do anything. It’s an effortless thing that happens,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.892
it’s a happening, and the kundalini rises by itself.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.892
Only put both your feet straight on the Mother Earth. Straight, as far as possible,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.892
straight touching the Mother Earth. But those who are sitting on the ground are all right,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:52.892
they can sit with [HINDI], on the ground is all right. [HINDI]

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:06.892
Now put your both the hands towards Me, as I told you, and close your eyes.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.892
We have to have a proper attitude towards ourselves.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.892
Firstly, it’s going to be the happiest thing that is going to happen to us,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.892
and the highest thing that we have been asking for ages.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.892
So we are not to be in any way under any tension about it, it’s really happening to all of us.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.892
Sit with a very cheerful mind, not frivolous but cheerful mind.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.892
And secondly you have to respect yourself.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.892
If there is any guilt or anything in your mind, it won’t work out, as I told you.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.892
You must know you’re saints, born to get self-realization.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.892
You are, as described by William Blake, you are men of God, who have to become prophets,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.892
who will have powers to make others prophets.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.892
So, that is the attitude we should have towards ourselves, that’s how you are here today.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.892
Please do not condemn yourself, do not have any guilt about yourself, nothing of the kind.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.892
Just believe in yourself, that you are the Spirit.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:22.892
Now, you have to keep both the hands on your lap (you can keep your purse down, lady, you can keep it, it’s all right).

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.892
Now put your both the hands towards Me, close your eyes fully.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.892
Some of you must have already started feeling a little cool breeze in your hands.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:44.892
Put both the hands like this, open upwards, just as like you do for [INAUDIBLE] or something.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:57.892
The left side, as I told you the other day, is for your desire, and the right side is for action.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.892
So we are going to put the left hand, all the time, as it is, desiring to be one with the Divine.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:18.892
And the right hand we are going to use for the action of removing the obstacles in our centres.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.892
So, first put the right hand on the heart, just on the heart, on the left hand side.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:38.892
Here resides the Spirit in human beings, so, now you ask Me a question without opening your eyes.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.892
You can call Me Mataji or Mother, as you like, whichever way you want to call Me.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.892
“Mother, am I the Spirit?”

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.892
Ask the question thrice, you have a right to ask Me that question.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.892
Now this right hand has to be taken down on the stomach, on the left hand side, on the upper part of the stomach.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:33.892
This is the centre of your mastery, or what we call the guru centre, it is on the left hand side of your stomach.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.892
On the left hand side you put this right hand. Put the left hand towards Me as it is.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:50.892
Now, here you ask a question, because you, as a spirit, has to be your own master, has to be your own Guru.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.892
So you ask Me a question thrice again, “Mother, am I my own Guru?” ask Me.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.892
With full confidence, “Am I my own master?”

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:23.892
On the higher part of the stomach, please put your right hand on the higher part of the stomach.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:34.892
Now, put this right hand on the left hand side of your stomach, in the lower region.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.892
There’s a centre there, in the lower region of your stomach, lower region of your stomach.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.892
On the left hand side, keeping the left hand towards Me.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:10:01.892
Now, this is the centre where is the knowledge of the working of your kundalini.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.892
In this centre, called as Shuddha Vidya, meaning the pure knowledge.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:17.892
As this point, I’m sorry but you have to ask for it, I cannot force anyone into it,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.892
like you cannot force a student to accept any knowledge.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:35.892
In the same way you have to say “Mother, give me that pure knowledge” or you can say “Mother, please give me that Shuddha Vidya”,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.892
you have to ask six times, because this centre has got six sub plexuses.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:51.892
So you have to ask six times, in a very humble way, “Mother, please give me that Shuddha Vidya”.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.892
That is the first asking.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:12.892
See this prayer, this is such a pure prayer. Give me the Shuddha Vidya, give me the pure knowledge of the Divine, the working of the Divine.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:30.892
Now, as you have entered into that realm of asking Me for the pure knowledge, the first thing you have to assume, is that [END OF TAPE].

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:31.000
H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
