00:00:19.082 --> 00:00:24.586
There are quite a few Sahaja Yogis who have come along with him from Rahuri.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.349
Similarly Mr. Dhumal from Rahuri who was giving lecture before us,

00:00:01.179 --> 00:00:06.975
This is a virtuous land.  The land where yoginis like Raul Ba reside is very venerable to me.

00:00:13.324 --> 00:00:17.302
 he has also created a revolution in the villages.

00:00:24.805 --> 00:00:33.002
And each one of them is a beautiful Sahaja yogi, chiseled like a diamond.

00:00:33.392 --> 00:00:45.192
To understand how knowledgeable they are and how deep their knowledge of the Divine principle is, one must have discussion with them.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.313
Sahaja Yoga

00:00:49.443 --> 00:01:00.560
 means Sahaja, ‘Saha’  means with us and ‘Ja’ means born with. Sahaja Yoga is Maha Yoga (great Yoga). It is born with us.

00:01:01.271 --> 00:01:03.521
Just position your hands like this. If you wish to activate Kundalini, then keep your hands like this.

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:05.266
Simple. Remove your caps.

00:01:05.886 --> 00:01:08.782
Also remove black threads if you are wearing them. So that it will happen easily.

00:01:09.262 --> 00:01:14.454
If you are wearing religious beads in the neck, better to remove them because it obstructs, Kundalini stop there.

00:01:15.273 --> 00:01:22.353
From time immemorial, people have said that Kundalini   is an institution within us.

00:01:22.636 --> 00:01:30.443
This has been especially elaborated by Adi Shankaracharya and Markandeya Swami.

00:01:30.676 --> 00:01:41.622
After that Kabir and Guru Nanak have  also explained and written in detail. Kundalini is our mother and mother is a very holy establishment.

00:01:41.794 --> 00:01:49.623
Now a dirty person like Freud who had illicit relationship with his mother has created a dirty situation.

00:01:49.967 --> 00:01:54.561
That is why in the western world, the extent of damage they have suffered  , you should see

00:01:54.716 --> 00:02:01.983
and you would be surprised that this demon –  Hitler only beheaded people – but this person has adversely  affected everyone’s Kundalini.

00:02:02.264 --> 00:02:05.381
Kundalini is a mother and she is pure Mother.

00:02:07.116 --> 00:02:11.586
The purity of the mother need not be explained to an Indian.

00:02:11.985 --> 00:02:16.253
Those who do not understand the purity of mother cannot achieve Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.573
It is just not possible.

00:02:18.975 --> 00:02:26.485
I have also seen many people, who in spite being Indians, have forgotten holiness, forgotten the importance of holiness.

00:02:26.641 --> 00:02:33.437
They have taken such a path that will straightaway lead them to destruction.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:42.159
This Power is situated in us, resides in us and many people have informed us about its existence.

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:52.513
There are many gurus today who do not have any history and whatever they say has no basis.They have evolved their own spurious method to earn money.

00:02:54.225 --> 00:02:57.973
There needs to be some history to it. Every incident is historical.

00:02:58.083 --> 00:03:05.568
If you see the evolution right from Amoeba to becoming a human being, he had to come up step by step.

00:03:05.707 --> 00:03:13.609
Similarly the entire history of the spiritual life , that is also an event that leads you to a path.

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:29.486
If  it is a live process then just like  a seed develops into roots, trunk, leaves, flowers and then it bears fruits –  all this takes place step by step.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:38.089
Similarly whatever we have read today of spirituality, may be by Saint Tukaram or Dnyaneshwar or great saints in our country before them.

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:40.245


00:03:40.316 --> 00:03:48.403
many spurious gurus have sidelined these saints and have professed themselves to be self righteous and have evolved different ways of making money.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:55.600
In this process even if they perform wrong deeds still they feel that these are appropriate.

00:03:55.665 --> 00:03:59.828
Somehow they perform some tricks with the help of hypnosis, these things get fixed in people’s minds and people start believing them.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.781
Going forward, the state of these people becomes mentally imbalanced and that is bound to happen because ,

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:13.678
 whatever is true, that which exists – there has to be means to achieve it.

00:04:14.038 --> 00:04:18.444
Why did God make us Human beings from Amoeba? How did he do this?

00:04:18.577 --> 00:04:20.928
What design he created in us,

00:04:21.179 --> 00:04:24.577
whatever daily transactions we do,

00:04:25.227 --> 00:04:27.789
what is the ‘sukshma’ (subtle) power that drives these –

00:04:27.829 --> 00:04:33.037
regarding this, not only in our scriptures but in other scriptures as well a lot of study has been done.

00:04:33.163 --> 00:04:37.003
It is mentioned even in the Bible and in the Quran as well.

00:04:37.327 --> 00:04:43.159
Similarly it is mentioned in all our holy scriptures in great detail.

00:04:43.528 --> 00:04:48.908
And in every religion, it is mentioned that you should recognize your atma (spirit).

00:04:49.013 --> 00:04:52.755
You need to take birth again. You should be reborn.

00:04:53.298 --> 00:04:58.573
Until as you take rebirth there is no meaning to other things.

00:04:59.124 --> 00:05:02.554
There was a big scientist called DENT.

00:05:02.755 --> 00:05:07.741
He has stipulated that until you get the atma(soul) and its entrance,

00:05:07.859 --> 00:05:14.945
 till then even if you do any religious work you will not come to know if you are worshipping a demon.

00:05:15.117 --> 00:05:19.179
Because it is due to the atma that a person becomes a whole and his eyes open.

00:05:19.336 --> 00:05:23.492
Means that if there was no light here so whatever you were seeing was in darkness.

00:05:23.685 --> 00:05:28.808
And in the darkness you were not seeing anything. So you believed that  whatever you got is the truth.

00:05:29.443 --> 00:05:32.871
Atma is the eyes of spirituality.

00:05:33.223 --> 00:05:38.996
Without opening them you cannot know anything about atma or Paramatma (soul or Supreme spirit).

00:05:40.457 --> 00:05:47.926
What should one do while doing this? What should we improvise while doing this – is what people say.

00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:53.426
I have a simple question. You became a human being from an amoeba, what did you do about it?

00:05:55.223 --> 00:05:59.902
Or ask a fruit that it became a fruit from a seed, what did you do?

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:03.529
 Any live process happens automatically.

00:06:03.717 --> 00:06:09.006
A human being cannot perform any live operation until he gets connected to atma (soul).

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:11.178
This is all dead work.

00:06:11.225 --> 00:06:20.743
If there are bricks, these are dead if you build a house, if a tree falls down and if you make a bench from it, it is all dead work.

00:06:20.978 --> 00:06:22.400
 It is not live work.

00:06:22.853 --> 00:06:28.351
Human being can perform a live work only when the light of atma (soul) appears in him.

00:06:29.961 --> 00:06:35.851
  Now I will tell you about Kundalini and I will describe one or two experiences about it.

00:06:36.758 --> 00:06:40.148
You can see with your eyes the pulsation of Kundalini.

00:06:41.266 --> 00:06:42.531
That is my identity.

00:06:42.648 --> 00:06:47.390
Markandeya has professed about me, that the Kundalini will pulsate at Her feet.

00:06:47.799 --> 00:06:51.359
There are many people who have seen the pulsations of Kundalini.

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:53.460
Have seen pulsation of thousands of people.

00:06:53.586 --> 00:06:57.578
It pulsates in the sacrum bone. We have taken films of these as well.

00:06:57.938 --> 00:07:01.250
This work is happening for many people in London.

00:07:04.568 --> 00:07:06.953
You can observe this pulsation when it rising up.

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:24.874
But for people who are not complicated and those who are pure ,simple and straight forward , they don’t even realize  when the Kundalini has risen. They reach thoughtless awareness and after that the divine vibrations start flowing through their palms.

00:07:25.545 --> 00:07:28.419
That is why I do my work mostly in the villages.

00:07:28.975 --> 00:07:33.630
 I do not work in cities because there are a lot of impostors in the cities.

00:07:34.131 --> 00:07:38.724
The urban folks fall prey to these imposters.They want the impostors, need some circus.

00:07:39.063 --> 00:07:40.396
They do not need the truth.

00:07:40.475 --> 00:07:43.576
They want to participate in some or other   circus.

00:07:44.365 --> 00:07:49.922
A villager is simple, straight forward and religious.

00:07:50.243 --> 00:07:55.633
We call this as spiritual sensitivity.

00:07:55.985 --> 00:07:59.477
During the time of Rama when he went for his exile in the forest,

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.602
that time all poor people and all the people in his path,

00:08:02.798 --> 00:08:06.500
even while wandering in the forest, they knew that this is Shri Rama.

00:08:08.631 --> 00:08:14.435
Now we say that we have Ashtavinayaks (eight Ganeshas) over here and we have a role of the Ashtavinayaks.Who are these Ashtavinayaks?

00:08:15.677 --> 00:08:20.380
Ashtavinayaks are the divine elements that have evolved out of the earth.

00:08:22.673 --> 00:08:25.263
Vinayak is a symbol of these.

00:08:25.579 --> 00:08:28.641
This is the biggest symbol. We must recognize it.

00:08:30.405 --> 00:08:32.662
 It is the symbol of purity.

00:08:32.936 --> 00:08:38.366
When God created this universe, he first created Ganesh, created purity.

00:08:38.654 --> 00:08:40.913
But the so called Gurus have created an exactly opposite situation.

00:08:41.194 --> 00:08:48.120
They destroy the purity by creating promiscuity and bring the demons there.

00:08:48.405 --> 00:08:54.740
For example if there is a photo of a goddess then they do some promiscuous acts in front of the Diety.This is the characteristics of tantriks.

00:08:55.521 --> 00:09:00.373
That is why the deity’s attention goes away from there because she does not stay where there is filth and promiscuity.

00:09:01.475 --> 00:09:04.677
she likes fragrance, she likes flowers.

00:09:04.725 --> 00:09:08.662
She likes all the beauty in this world. She does not like filth.

00:09:08.803 --> 00:09:14.727
She cannot tolerate things such as adultery, As soon as she moves her attention away, the demons establish their reign over there.

00:09:15.439 --> 00:09:19.774
Once this happens, to entice people, to hypnotise them,

00:09:20.595 --> 00:09:27.852
 to extract money from them, to have fun with their money – it is such a deplorable situation. It is a situation of great stupor.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.485
Similarly in this way the spurious gurus are cheating people.

00:09:34.033 --> 00:09:36.712
But it does not mean that real gurus don’t exist in this world.

00:09:36.939 --> 00:09:39.368
Even today there are authentic gurus in this world.

00:09:39.533 --> 00:09:41.790
But most of them are hiding themselves in the forest.

00:09:42.017 --> 00:09:46.102
They come to meet me and say “Mother, you work for 10-12 years and then we will come.

00:09:46.236 --> 00:09:49.126
Today’s world belongs to impostors, devils.

00:09:49.392 --> 00:09:53.774
These devils have appeared recently and people have fallen for these devils.People don’t need the truth;

00:09:53.978 --> 00:09:56.837
they are hell bent on destroying themselves.

00:09:57.072 --> 00:09:59.063
They don’t see their downfall.

00:09:59.267 --> 00:10:01.032
We do not want to come in such a world.

00:10:01.134 --> 00:10:06.966
These people will crucify us or they might poison us. So we don’t want to come.”

00:10:08.429 --> 00:10:16.608
Even while this is the state of Sahaja Yoga today, I am very happy.In this tour of Maharashtra, many people got their realization.

00:10:16.822 --> 00:10:24.556
Within a moment, just in a moment Kundalini rapidly rose up and crossed the Fontanel area called Brahma Randhra.

00:10:24.611 --> 00:10:26.439
We need to know whether it is there or not within us.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:28.634
We have two doctors

00:10:30.197 --> 00:10:35.540
and many other doctors are our disciples in London and we have done a lot of work there.

00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:41.431
I have a lecture on Medical Sciences; I have myself studied medicine as I have to deal with doctors.

00:10:41.936 --> 00:10:47.585
In London I have cured the wife of a doctor from cancer –

00:10:47.642 --> 00:10:53.806
this eminent doctor has organized a conference for doctors – here all these matters will be discussed.

00:10:55.611 --> 00:11:02.813
So whatever powers we have within us, how it is related to the Almighty is what I am going to tell you.

00:11:02.923 --> 00:11:13.181
One historic connection is that I want to tell you is till today whatever incarnations happened one after the other, it is the time that we get the fruits of these incarnations which have happened.

00:11:14.134 --> 00:11:22.218
Now a days there is a fad that for each incarnation, using self righteous ill logic and by causing confusion , by making fool of people, insult all of them.

00:11:22.266 --> 00:11:25.210
And we too accept it condescendingly.

00:11:25.601 --> 00:11:27.476
This is a great sin.

00:11:28.672 --> 00:11:38.666
To make mockery of the incarnations, to belittle them without understanding them, is a very fearsome deed. Should not do this.

00:11:39.698 --> 00:11:42.598
First you should understand where you stand.

00:11:42.668 --> 00:11:48.237
What is your eligibility, what have you achieved and this so called guru or anyone who speaks like this .

00:11:48.441 --> 00:11:52.542
 what is his achievement if any and what is his state.

00:11:52.652 --> 00:11:56.550
He may be sneezing throughout the day, is ill.

00:11:56.644 --> 00:12:01.753
Its not known if he has cured any sick person- youngsters these days are after such person too.

00:12:02.699 --> 00:12:06.198
It is surprising that it is happening in our country.

00:12:06.433 --> 00:12:14.378
Leave aside what is happening abroad. There are such dirty people abroad that to teach them – they themselves will educate their teachers- they know such things.

00:12:14.589 --> 00:12:18.589
But whatever filth they have fallen into, they are trying to come out of it.

00:12:18.706 --> 00:12:23.878
They have realized, in their thoughts they have understood that they have dumped in a deep pit.

00:12:23.956 --> 00:12:27.495
All our arrangement has gone awry. Our children are misled, we are misled.

00:12:27.605 --> 00:12:32.120
That person has destroyed all the purity that we had.

00:12:32.238 --> 00:12:37.792
 In spite of everybody knowing all this about Freud (Sigmund ), today the same Freud is sitting over our head.

00:12:40.862 --> 00:12:47.242
We have such an ancient tradition, should at least study that tradition and understand it.

00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:53.477
We have some of the best writers who have written a lot on truth.

00:12:53.797 --> 00:12:58.188
We should collect information about it and only then approach the fraudsters for knowledge.

00:13:01.415 --> 00:13:11.231
First of all, we need to understand whatever work of God or lecture of God or to know about God or to awaken the Kundalini, you cannot accept money.

00:13:12.013 --> 00:13:13.693
It is a sign of baseness

00:13:15.927 --> 00:13:18.827
 Kundalini Awakening happens automatically.

00:13:19.286 --> 00:13:22.903
How much money you can pay to sprout a seed?

00:13:25.536 --> 00:13:34.075
Those who live off on other’s money they are very base people, Even if they have amassed money by fraudulent means, you should not believe them.

00:13:34.368 --> 00:13:36.684
This practice is quite prevalent in our cities.

00:13:36.755 --> 00:13:44.188
That is why I wish to inform the people from Dhule that until you are completely deep rooted, till then keep your intellect intact.

00:13:44.423 --> 00:13:53.001
And know that the Divine element is of utmost importance, you must get it, will get it.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.876
You will get it automatically.

00:13:54.962 --> 00:14:01.196
And for this if someone aks you for money, you should tell him that you cannot purchase God.

00:14:01.911 --> 00:14:04.040
And for this you cannot offer money as well.

00:14:05.915 --> 00:14:09.071
I am surprised that in the name of God they sell anything.

00:14:10.102 --> 00:14:13.079
Means who dont know selling, people seling anything on his name.

00:14:15.345 --> 00:14:20.830
This is very surprising and you must understand this. As I am in a city,

00:14:20.921 --> 00:14:26.835
 I am telling these citizens that you have money and you have deep  pockets.

00:14:27.429 --> 00:14:29.132
Sweet attracts flies.

00:14:30.015 --> 00:14:32.655
These people know that you have money .

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.233
These are the devils stuck to the bodies of rich  people.

00:14:37.788 --> 00:14:41.155
They will not feel content till they extract all their money.

00:14:41.249 --> 00:14:42.546
That is why one should be careful.

00:14:42.609 --> 00:14:50.892
 They would sow an ego bolstering thought in you that you are spending money for a Divine cause and they will swindle you completely of your money.

00:14:51.049 --> 00:14:56.213
After being swindled, you will come crying to me that Mataji, we have been swindled.

00:14:57.721 --> 00:15:00.275
Whatever is the truth , should appear automatically.

00:15:00.439 --> 00:15:05.360
This awareness that you are human, this awareness has reached this stage.

00:15:05.533 --> 00:15:07.635
This you have got on its own.

00:15:07.794 --> 00:15:17.282
For this you have not jumped around nor did you catch hold of anything nor have you done anything so it has happened automatically by the grace of God.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:22.565
If a drop separates from the sea,

00:15:23.154 --> 00:15:27.333
it cannot come back to the sea. But the sea itself has to come to the drop.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:44.473
The Almighty also has this question because if He has created this universe, the entire universe he created is so beautiful – whatever he created till today – then this universe must have some meaning.

00:15:44.778 --> 00:15:47.801
.The human that He created with so much effort,

00:15:48.153 --> 00:15:51.590
and in which there are thousands of nerves and Thousands of organs in place.

00:15:51.989 --> 00:16:01.952
– in today’s  state of a great deluge , in the daily behaviour , in the  daily dealings as well ,  He is  so alert

00:16:02.952 --> 00:16:07.054
so such an Almighty did not give any purpose to this human ?

00:16:07.484 --> 00:16:12.874
Means imagine that we have created a machine and if we do not connect it to the mains then there is no meaning

00:16:13.484 --> 00:16:17.288
similarly until you get connected to the mains, there is no meaning to you

00:16:17.804 --> 00:16:21.452
but if He cannot do it then you will also not be able to do it.

00:16:21.609 --> 00:16:26.857
This does not mean that only I am doing something or I have done something in it.

00:16:27.187 --> 00:16:30.030
This principle is quite understandable.

00:16:30.406 --> 00:16:37.920
If there is a lamp which is lighted and if another lamp is ready it can also get lighted very easily.

00:16:38.587 --> 00:16:48.949
This is a very simple principle. God has created a lamp inside you alright – this can be observed and we need to understand this.

00:16:56.981 --> 00:17:03.879
Your Mother, Kundalini is situated inside the sacrum bone.everyone has this mother and She has been placed there by God.

00:17:04.213 --> 00:17:11.360
Let us think that this is your tape – situated inside the sacrum bone shaped as three and a half coils, birth after birth.

00:17:11.598 --> 00:17:16.571
Now people will say that people give lecture on Kundalini without knowing anything about it and still they will give lecture and talk about it.

00:17:16.908 --> 00:17:18.250
She is your Mother.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:20.485
Everybody’s mother.

00:17:21.235 --> 00:17:25.672
And the chakra seen below this is called as Mooladhar Chakra.

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:27.563
Ganesh is situated inside this.

00:17:29.243 --> 00:17:33.680
What is the purpose? It is only for the protection of Kundalini-

00:17:35.266 --> 00:17:40.359
 for the security of the chastity of Kundalini. The one who is Gauri ,

00:17:41.272 --> 00:17:44.265
has established, Gauri is your Mother.

00:17:44.797 --> 00:17:52.812
She is waiting for the day when some authorized person will appear before you when she can give you a rebirth.

00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:59.604
She has accompanied you since all your past births.

00:18:01.563 --> 00:18:06.656
She is located there and Ganesh is only installed below. Now what all is said about the Ganesh element is not sufficient There is so much to say about the Ganesh element.

00:18:06.922 --> 00:18:09.140
Because this is the element of a child.

00:18:10.813 --> 00:18:16.633
Just like a small child is innocent similarly this element is imbibed in us.

00:18:17.078 --> 00:18:21.773
The main intention of these people is to destroy the innocence within you.

00:18:23.414 --> 00:18:25.883
They want to destroy the Ganesh within you.

00:18:26.024 --> 00:18:28.461
So your Kundalini cannot be protected.

00:18:30.625 --> 00:18:38.648
Out Of the powers Ganesh has, one of them is the power of sex.

00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:49.284
Because He is a child who does not understand anything, As he is innocent he is positioned there.

00:18:50.675 --> 00:18:54.456
During the practice of Sahaja Yoga, you need to be innocent like that child.

00:18:55.769 --> 00:18:58.026
Or else your Kundalini will not rise.

00:18:58.214 --> 00:18:59.542
And it happens for sure.

00:18:59.667 --> 00:19:02.284
When the Kundalini rises, the ‘Bandha” (bond, knot) is formed there.

00:19:04.097 --> 00:19:18.046
And the Kundalini rises. At that time Ganesh tells that one is getting vibrations on the palm, then the Kundalini gets a directive that the moment is opportune, you can rise now and this event takes place.

00:19:18.445 --> 00:19:23.499
We worship Ganesh but we do not know what Ganesh is.

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:31.741
Now to narrate all about HIM is difficult but still there is a close relation between Ganesh and Carbon.

00:19:34.429 --> 00:19:42.115
This element is present in each human being and it is being flagrantly destroyed.

00:19:42.268 --> 00:19:45.252
If it is destroyed then you destruction is imminent.

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:52.018
Hence people are after destroying HIM first.Means after destroying your purity they can easily destroy you.

00:19:52.604 --> 00:19:54.338
This is their modus operandi.

00:19:54.877 --> 00:20:01.057
This Ganesh, who is sitting below, gets awakened  when the vibrations are created in Him.

00:20:02.276 --> 00:20:07.460
After awakening, He indicates Kundalini that there is no issue in rising up now.

00:20:08.096 --> 00:20:14.103
Now we must note that Kundalini does not pierce this seventh Chakra.

00:20:14.588 --> 00:20:16.853
Kundalini pierces the 6 Chakras at the top.

00:20:16.901 --> 00:20:19.010
The lower chakra is intact as it was.

00:20:20.543 --> 00:20:24.575
So such idiots,  who use filthy deeds to awaken the Kundalini,

00:20:25.049 --> 00:20:29.838
are  destroying your personality by destroying your purity

00:20:29.916 --> 00:20:31.603
–  that too after taking money from you for this.this must be noted.

00:20:32.038 --> 00:20:36.791
Don’t make fool of yourself, just ask yourself what you got from this.

00:20:37.557 --> 00:20:43.338
The almighty has installed this element with great effort, it should awaken there.

00:20:44.065 --> 00:20:49.242
That is why Mahararashtra is :Maha”(great) ‘Rashtra”( country) and such people will not thrive here.

00:20:49.335 --> 00:20:56.483
 Because the reign of AshtavInayakas present here and the vibrations emanating from them reverberates the environment.

00:20:59.595 --> 00:21:02.164
Many people say that this is idol worshipping.

00:21:03.017 --> 00:21:06.454
How to tell them that this is the element of divine energy.

00:21:06.509 --> 00:21:08.665
Because there are no divine vibrations flowing through their palms.

00:21:08.751 --> 00:21:11.962
There is no point is speaking with those don’t get divine vibrations in their palms.

00:21:12.064 --> 00:21:18.681
That is why I say that until the atma (inner self) is tested, there is no point in doing anything regarding religion(dharma).

00:21:18.744 --> 00:21:23.321
If you wish to operate telephones without connection it has no meaning.It is like that

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:28.924
The first thing is that the Kundalini should be awakened and you should get your self realization.

00:21:29.447 --> 00:21:32.556
After that the vibrations start flowing through your palms

00:21:33.566 --> 00:21:36.510
I will now tell you how this arrangement is made within us.

00:21:36.674 --> 00:21:37.197
(Start it)

00:21:38.899 --> 00:21:41.314
 In this picture, you will see three Nadis.

00:21:42.282 --> 00:21:44.875
One on the right, one on the left and one is in the centre.

00:21:48.002 --> 00:21:54.244
These Nadis nourish what is called as autonomous nervous system which is Self-Running.

00:21:55.369 --> 00:22:00.033
These three Subtle Nadis are inside bones of our Spine.

00:22:01.744 --> 00:22:06.096
These three nadis are three Powers of God that operate within us.

00:22:06.463 --> 00:22:11.666
Of these, the Nadi on the left called as Ida Nadi due to which our existence is there.

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:15.033
It is Shiva element due to which our existence is there.

00:22:15.562 --> 00:22:18.650
If this Nadi was not there , we would not have our existence within us.

00:22:18.737 --> 00:22:23.408
Our desires &amp; feelings are awakened because of this Nadi and are operational within us.

00:22:23.588 --> 00:22:26.072
We also call this as Ida Nadi or Chandra Nadi.

00:22:26.588 --> 00:22:32.056
 We have heard about Hatha from Hatha Yoga.The ‘tha’ in Hatha yoga is the name of this Nadi.

00:22:34.127 --> 00:22:39.049
This Nadi exists due to the Power of the Almighty which is called Mahakali.

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:45.224
In Sanskrit we call it Mahakali. If there is no equivalent in English for this, what can I do.

00:22:45.865 --> 00:22:48.825
There is nothing that can be mentioned here about the knowledge of English people.

00:22:49.052 --> 00:22:53.411
They may be adept at politics but they have achieved any knowledge about religion.

00:22:54.365 --> 00:23:06.242
We have suffered  so much from  foreign rule that although we have achieved independence, we have not realized our existence.

00:23:06.508 --> 00:23:13.046
That is why we have forgotten all those people who had discovered great things in India.

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:15.747
Not only this we don’t even remember Gandhi Ji.

00:23:16.717 --> 00:23:19.725
This is a big mistake we are committing

00:23:20.357 --> 00:23:23.974
because- while the science discovered everything

00:23:24.162 --> 00:23:29.583
and they have reached this stage where they say that Kundalini awakening should happen

00:23:29.756 --> 00:23:34.677
and many of them have reached a stage where they feel that this happens due to some triggering,

00:23:36.217 --> 00:23:39.841
 it cannot happen due to any intelligence or due to any action.

00:23:39.897 --> 00:23:42.363
But it happens due to some triggering

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:47.365
Adi Shankaracharya has said “Na Yoge, Na Sankhyena “ – (that it will not happen by Yoga nor Sankya (Another Sect of philosophy)  – how will it happen?

00:23:47.459 --> 00:23:50.826
It will not happen due to debates, will not happen due to dancing or swaying.

00:23:50.951 --> 00:23:53.959
What will make it happen? Will happen due to Mother’s blessing – is what he told.

00:23:54.904 --> 00:24:02.302
After writing a great treatise like “Vivek Chudamani” , Shankaracharya wrote another treatise  “ Soundarya Lahri”

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:07.170
He has described his Mother and these vibrations in them – which we call as the Divine vibrations.

00:24:09.092 --> 00:24:13.412
Someone asked him why did he start all this.He said this is wisdom and everything else is ignorance.

00:24:14.069 --> 00:24:23.905
This is very true because element that  is all-pervading, the Divine element , it is operational and not a single leaf can move without God’s will.

00:24:24.138 --> 00:24:28.154
Unless you feel this , you recognize  this, you will not  understand.

00:24:28.693 --> 00:24:30.224
Our situation is as follows

00:24:30.342 --> 00:24:42.131
 –its like the villagers sitting in the plane and they say that we do not want to overload the plane, so lets keep the luggage on our heads – our situation is similar to this.

00:24:42.397 --> 00:24:44.975
Until this event takes place in you,

00:24:45.499 --> 00:24:50.217
I am not saying that it will happen for sure or I have not taken the responsibility for it,

00:24:50.358 --> 00:24:54.225
 If it happens it is your wealth, your good deed,

00:24:54.546 --> 00:24:59.342
this is a special blessing from the Almighty to you, so take it, I am ,sitting in the middle.

00:25:00.819 --> 00:25:03.545
If it does not happen it is not my mistake,

00:25:03.639 --> 00:25:07.358
it must be  your fault or  you may have some mental problem,

00:25:07.421 --> 00:25:10.826
or you may have some physical problem or some intellectual issue

00:25:10.905 --> 00:25:13.108
 or it may be some religious mistake on your part.

00:25:13.233 --> 00:25:15.311
That is why the Kundalini is obstructed.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.920
But it is the characteristics of Kundalini that when it rises

00:25:21.296 --> 00:25:30.791
, this left channel known as Ida Nadi that time while going in through all these chakras,

00:25:31.291 --> 00:25:36.221
similarly the one on the right called as Pingala Nadi

00:25:36.417 --> 00:25:38.791
– it activates these two while passing through them.

00:25:39.057 --> 00:25:42.697
Means the left and the right channel together form the chakra right at the centre.

00:25:43.628 --> 00:25:53.070
When this Kundalini pierces through this central chakra it benefits both sides.

00:25:54.837 --> 00:26:00.055
Now the Nadi on that side facilitates the physical and intellectual activities.

00:26:02.821 --> 00:26:07.188
Whatever future planning we have, whatever thoughts we have, we do through this.

00:26:09.001 --> 00:26:13.587
These two channels (Nadis) within us , these two Nadis inside the subtle system are called Ida &amp; Pingala ,

00:26:13.787 --> 00:26:19.626
and outside in the physical world are called the Left &amp; Right Sympathetic Nervous System.

00:26:22.236 --> 00:26:28.467
 Now these six chakras on the top, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,and 6 –

00:26:29.295 --> 00:26:39.296
 – I have told you that these have a history – during our various stages of evolution, these have been established within us.

00:26:39.531 --> 00:26:41.397
These are akin to milestones

00:26:41.734 --> 00:26:46.804
and one must understand that on each of these chakras there are individual deities, you must know this.

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:52.491
And if you understand how to awaken them then you will have the entire wisdom of the Divine element.

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:55.960
If you do not know this then it is ignorance.

00:26:57.054 --> 00:27:00.554
There is no doubt that I can cure cancer. I have actually done it.

00:27:01.148 --> 00:27:04.116
Have done it even in London. But it is not my business to cure people.

00:27:05.695 --> 00:27:13.780
Today Mr. Jaisingrao was telling me that ‘Mataji, I have achieved self realization five years back. My father used to be bed ridden all the time, everyone in my family suffered from diseases.

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:18.461
After I achieved self realization, no doctor has been summoned.

00:27:18.649 --> 00:27:21.914
Otherwise we used to pay doctor every week.’

00:27:24.024 --> 00:27:31.618
Because when the Kundalini rises up, then she nourishes the channel on the right side.

00:27:36.688 --> 00:27:41.110
This gives us physical benefit. Similarly the conditioning on the left channel is also rectified.

00:27:42.774 --> 00:27:47.016
Whatever Freud and others have said that whatever conditioning one has, has to be removed.

00:27:47.141 --> 00:27:48.719
means, It is a very individualistic work.

00:27:49.798 --> 00:27:54.470
If you remove the conditioning from a human being, it gives rise to ego.

00:27:56.987 --> 00:28:00.860
Now we see here two channels. The one on the left is Ida Nadi(Channel)

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:06.282
 which Freud has recognized. He does not know everything, knows a little like a blind person.

00:28:06.774 --> 00:28:13.857
So this channel, Ida Nadi is responsible for whatever mental things happen by conditioning means our past is created due to this.

00:28:13.977 --> 00:28:20.773
Whatever is our past, that is created. Now whatever I am speaking with you, this all will go in the Ida Nadi, in that region, in that area.

00:28:22.249 --> 00:28:23.968
But we have future too.

00:28:25.524 --> 00:28:29.257
And we also have this present.

00:28:29.656 --> 00:28:36.992
Freud could not decipher this as due to blindness he saw only half the thing and because he himself was a dirty person.

00:28:37.377 --> 00:28:44.040
a dirty person will discern only filthy things that are why he evolved such a weird new theory.

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:46.290
It is very individualistic.

00:28:46.603 --> 00:28:52.409
And due to the individualism whatever conditioning you have must be removed – he set this as a rule.

00:28:53.082 --> 00:28:58.813
 But if a person does not have a decent upbringing, how arrogant he becomes, how much ego he develops this we can see here.

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:02.953
Because the left side that goes up  it creates an organization called superego.

00:29:04.141 --> 00:29:09.297
And the activities we do from the right side – as a byproduct of this –  an organization called ego is developed

00:29:09.586 --> 00:29:11.430
This all is definitely psychological.

00:29:11.539 --> 00:29:13.226
Means this has certainly come after Freud.

00:29:13.469 --> 00:29:18.953
But after Freud nobody believes anybody else, they eugolised him as God. After him Jung(Carl) came and he did so much work but still nobody recognizes him.

00:29:20.493 --> 00:29:22.742
This is because people have a dirty mind set, they need promiscuity.

00:29:25.141 --> 00:29:28.492
So this super ego that evolves in us

00:29:28.758 --> 00:29:33.461
it come in us like , say – Imagine a small child feeding on his mother’s milk, it is happy completely,

00:29:33.743 --> 00:29:39.773
at that time if the mother changes the side, then  it gets angry.

00:29:39.993 --> 00:29:41.673
His ego gets awakened.

00:29:42.657 --> 00:29:47.719
Why this was done? Then his mother says keep quiet, this is conditioning. This gives rise to superego.

00:29:48.459 --> 00:29:50.328
Both of these should exist.

00:29:50.688 --> 00:29:54.703
Ego and superego must be balanced in a human being.

00:29:55.368 --> 00:30:03.234
When Kundalini rises through by making a space in between, it is sucked down by both sides and Kundalini pierces through the Fontanel area and you can witness it.

00:30:03.367 --> 00:30:06.734
Here the   top portion of your skull (Fontanel area) goes inside.

00:30:09.656 --> 00:30:15.437
These six chakras have different names. . I don’t have time to tell everything now,

00:30:16.136 --> 00:30:20.656
but what I wish to tell you is when Kundalini pierces the Fontanel area,

00:30:21.216 --> 00:30:24.968
then you will develop collective consciousness in you, means what is called actualization.

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:31.475
It will happen. No need to tell. Those who have got self realization can tell where their Kundalini is.

00:30:31.803 --> 00:30:36.685
Our fingers have all the sympathetic chakras.

00:30:37.608 --> 00:30:41.646
We can feel on the fingers which of the chakra on the left or right side has a catch.

00:30:41.756 --> 00:30:46.693
We don’t know before that. It is only after achieving self realization we come to know what is wrong with us.

00:30:46.834 --> 00:30:53.955
This cannot be termed as lecture or speech or book, but this event takes place in you,

00:30:54.017 --> 00:31:01.955
you become that, you become super human, in which you understand collective consciousness.

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:05.056
Even a small child can tell which chakra of yours is affected.

00:31:06.299 --> 00:31:11.502
My granddaughter is two and a half years old. We had a girl named Patricia from England visiting us. She has gone back now

00:31:12.786 --> 00:31:18.642
 She asked Anupama (my granddaughter) , which chakra of mine has a catch. She said left Nabhi and left Vishuddhi.

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:20.619
And she actually had a catch.

00:31:21.229 --> 00:31:25.806
Because the fingers get the burning sensation. This is subjective knowledge. You become a subject, you become the doer.

00:31:27.799 --> 00:31:32.408
For example, if a person walks through dirt, he recoils.

00:31:35.049 --> 00:31:39.634
If an animal walks through dirt, it does not affect it, a human being gets affected.

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:46.689
Nowadays I have seen such people who get affected adversely due to perfume, so how dirty the person must be.

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:53.267
They suffer due to dirt, they are human beings.

00:31:53.916 --> 00:31:59.791
Going forward when they become aware ,they suffer due to  moral turpitude.

00:32:00.455 --> 00:32:04.017
So when I say that people have overcome their vices,

00:32:04.565 --> 00:32:12.565
it is not because I have instituted liquor prohibition because once the happiness of the soul starts dripping, then all these things detach automatically.We take these things because we get bored.

00:32:13.102 --> 00:32:17.218
But in this movement of soul (atma) a person becomes so engrossed in the happiness,

00:32:18.031 --> 00:32:30.265
he becomes so contended, so satisfied similarly his personality become so beautiful, so attractive that is to say he becomes very dynamic.

00:32:30.547 --> 00:32:32.601
Whatever they have told is correct.

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:36.750
The children who never used to study started coming first in the class and it is very true.

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:43.507
When such event takes place, when it happens in human being,

00:32:44.532 --> 00:32:49.700
 the human does not go near any addiction because his attention will not go there.

00:32:49.817 --> 00:32:57.277
His awareness is so illuminated, that he does not go to such filty thing and automatically it is discarded.

00:33:00.395 --> 00:33:02.871
You know it from within that this chakra has a catch.

00:33:04.783 --> 00:33:14.757
The Kundalini is rising from here, where she has reached at the top. Even if you did not see the Kundalini still you will perceive from within where this person’s Kundalini is going and where it has reached on the top.

00:33:16.098 --> 00:33:18.230
This entire science is ages old.

00:33:19.332 --> 00:33:22.449
This is not explained today.

00:33:22.574 --> 00:33:26.246
Kabira has also explained Sahaja Yoga. But some people have also misinterpreted Kabira

00:33:26.488 --> 00:33:29.088
I am amazed at the thinking of people;

00:33:31.301 --> 00:33:35.636
 to see how they misinterpret everything and also how do you all accept it.

00:33:40.215 --> 00:33:46.605
Kabir has also written on this, Nanak has written on this, Saint Tukaram  has written , and Dnyaneshwar has very clearly stated.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:52.511
So first things about our country is that we have predefined limits.

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:55.332
This is a very significant thing. Our country is a great country.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:59.769
They may have money but they do not have the Lakshmi (diety) principle.

00:34:00.213 --> 00:34:04.613
They are very dirty people. If you wish to know about these people, go and see in their country.

00:34:04.863 --> 00:34:09.230
Our Sahaja Yogis from there are very surprised to see how affectionate the people from here are.

00:34:09.856 --> 00:34:14.535
If you happen to visit any foreigners there, they will not offer even a cup of tea, even if he is a wealthy lord.

00:34:14.957 --> 00:34:17.222
He will preserve each penny.

00:34:18.379 --> 00:34:22.472
If we have some sundry visitors, our people may at most take their shoes and chappals etc.

00:34:23.262 --> 00:34:27.082
However, if you invite someone at your place over there, then he would elope with ladies and females in the house.

00:34:30.324 --> 00:34:33.144
So much filth is there in those countries.

00:34:33.496 --> 00:34:36.574
We feel that people over there are very happy.

00:34:36.738 --> 00:34:42.785
Sweden, where maximum prosperity is there, lot of money is there, the proportion of suicides is the highest.

00:34:44.184 --> 00:34:49.269
Means nine out of ten are thinking about suicide.

00:34:49.785 --> 00:34:53.394
What is the use of such wealth and property.

00:34:53.879 --> 00:35:05.377
Statistics in London indicates that In England parents kill two children every week.

00:35:07.745 --> 00:35:12.291
Out of every three families,

00:35:15.247 --> 00:35:19.239
Out of every three families, at least one family’s parents are in the danger of being killed.

00:35:19.591 --> 00:35:21.091
Statistics indicates this.

00:35:22.122 --> 00:35:23.606
And they shamelessly tell this.

00:35:23.888 --> 00:35:30.091
They are absolutely shameless, that is their main characteristics. They don’t have the concept of shame.

00:35:30.607 --> 00:35:33.762
Just live a shameless life.

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:36.481
In such a place too, we established Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:36.575 --> 00:35:39.854
Today we have 300 diamonds, genuine Sahaja Yogis over there.

00:35:40.097 --> 00:35:42.026
And they are so knowledgeable that they can explain everything about Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:42.417 --> 00:35:48.511
 I have seen so many Sahaja Yogis,I have so many disciples over there, they have done so much work there,

00:35:49.324 --> 00:35:53.370
including Indians over there and they have delved so deep in Sahaja Yoga and they have such detailed knowledge.

00:35:53.962 --> 00:35:58.548
But I have not seen such foreigners who have taken so much effort for Sahaja Yoga,

00:35:59.196 --> 00:36:06.001
and by reading every detail and extracting the essence, by examining closely all the aspects,

00:36:06.481 --> 00:36:10.418
 and by studying it completely they have dedicated their lives to Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:12.257 --> 00:36:18.652
And they are still taking efforts, and are not   cribbing and shouting like idiots.

00:36:20.027 --> 00:36:23.214
Any Stray person should misguide you and you go running after him.

00:36:23.379 --> 00:36:32.610
They use their intellect to understand each and every word, what is this chakra and what is that chakra , and how does the Kundalini rise on this chakra, how to raise her.

00:36:32.673 --> 00:36:36.274
These people only have cured thousands of people. Nowadays I do not cure any one.

00:36:38.149 --> 00:36:41.259
This power is flowing within us.

00:36:41.611 --> 00:36:45.993
The simple people from average villages have created miracles

00:36:48.231 --> 00:36:51.472
but we do not publicize so much about these things,

00:36:51.988 --> 00:36:56.058
it happens automatically. I was very surprised to see an article from Mr. Pardhi in Tarun- Bharat (Newspaper).

00:36:56.207 --> 00:36:59.597
He had casually given that article, I had not asked him to do so.

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:05.605
People sell many things in the name of Kundalini.

00:37:05.812 --> 00:37:08.285
First there should be collective consciousness in Kundalini.

00:37:08.584 --> 00:37:13.433
The person should get into collective consciousness. He should understand where the other person’s Kundalini is.

00:37:13.715 --> 00:37:17.636
I get a lot people, I tell you –
 ‘Mataji, my Kundalini is awakened.’  ’ Alright. Sit here.’

00:37:17.715 --> 00:37:23.207
 Then they get frenzied ( start flying) like a horse or start jumping like frogs.

00:37:23.332 --> 00:37:24.425
 I ask them ‘What is this?’

00:37:24.606 --> 00:37:26.589
‘Our Kundalini is awakened so we fly like this.’

00:37:26.707 --> 00:37:32.808
 I say, ‘do you want to become a super human or a horse or a frog or tomorrow you may choose to be fleas.

00:37:34.346 --> 00:37:41.413
You shout like a cattle , Is this a sign of a human being? And I speak of a super human Almighty.And what are you doing in front of me.’

00:37:41.773 --> 00:37:43.905
They say,’ our guru has told us.’
 ‘Is that so?’

00:37:44.148 --> 00:37:46.577
‘He has given us the mantra to chant.’
 ‘Fine.’

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:49.093
‘Has given us chanting beads.’

00:37:49.835 --> 00:37:53.171
 ‘Fine. Where is the Kundalini? Has it risen up or no?

00:37:53.585 --> 00:37:56.866
  if your Kundalini is risen up(awakened), then tell me where this person’s Kundalini is?’

00:37:57.804 --> 00:38:01.007
‘How to tell that?’
 ‘Then I said ‘how did your Kundalini rise?

00:38:03.241 --> 00:38:06.257
  Tell me what disease this person is suffering from?’‘  ‘We can’t tell that.’

00:38:07.601 --> 00:38:10.397
 ‘Ok tell me what trouble you have. On the chakras.’

00:38:10.718 --> 00:38:15.139
‘Mataji, we don’t know all that. Our guru has only mentioned that there are things like chakras.’

00:38:15.312 --> 00:38:19.655
OK. And he has given you this. At the end, all of you should go to an asylum. Straightaway. ‘

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:23.132
So many sinful deeds are happening in this world.

00:38:23.695 --> 00:38:27.312
To earn money they could indulge in smuggling, they can do whatever they want.
