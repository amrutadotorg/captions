1
00:00:48,508 --> 00:00:55,508
It’s very nice to see all of you here, so
many of you from Australia,

2
00:00:57,823 --> 00:01:00,447
to worship Shiva, Sadashiva.

3
00:01:02,236 --> 00:01:05,623
I think this is a very important occasion.

4
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:22,296
Is important, because Sadashiva,

5
00:01:24,076 --> 00:01:27,602
the God Almighty, who is One,

6
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:33,914
is expressed on your heart as Spirit, the Shiva.

7
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:51,623
We have to understand that so many people
came on this earth at different times, in

8
00:01:51,932 --> 00:02:03,168
different countries, and they talked to different
people about righteousness, that is dharma,

9
00:02:06,381 --> 00:02:09,181
about how to elevate yourself,

10
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,589
and all of them have said that you have to be reborn,

11
00:02:17,335 --> 00:02:20,400
that is, you have to become the Spirit.

12
00:02:20,786 --> 00:02:22,282
They have all

13
00:02:31,052 --> 00:02:35,111
said the same thing because they knew, without

14
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:45,980
the attention is filled with the light of the Spirit,

15
00:02:47,296 --> 00:02:51,326
you will not be able to understand spirituality.

16
00:03:07,778 --> 00:03:09,978
You have the Spirit within you,

17
00:03:11,377 --> 00:03:14,994
which is all the time in a witness state.

18
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:19,070
Why all the religions have failed?

19
00:03:19,887 --> 00:03:24,501
Because they did not get their Self-Realization.

20
00:03:26,103 --> 00:03:28,614
They did not become the Spirit.

21
00:03:31,936 --> 00:03:36,760
So there's a tremendous difference between you and all others

22
00:03:36,935 --> 00:03:41,226
who profess something. It looks as if they are hypocrites.

23
00:03:42,683 --> 00:03:48,506
They intellectualize it as you know, they explain it very well,

24
00:03:49,767 --> 00:03:54,858
but you can see very clearly
that they haven't absorbed spirituality.

25
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:04,225
That absorption was impossible without Self-Realization.

26
00:04:06,607 --> 00:04:08,829
This everybody felt.

27
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:13,815
Buddha went to this limit and Mahavira both, to say that,

28
00:04:14,064 --> 00:04:16,241
forget about God,

29
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,846
forget about God Almighty,

30
00:04:19,992 --> 00:04:23,483
you just get your Self, your Self-Realization.

31
00:04:24,624 --> 00:04:27,605
So they are called as atheist in Idikshavadi,

32
00:04:27,755 --> 00:04:30,045
they don't believe in Ishwara,

33
00:04:31,155 --> 00:04:36,651
but they felt that the way
people are just talking about God Almighty

34
00:04:36,853 --> 00:04:39,496
and what the books have said.

35
00:04:40,584 --> 00:04:46,743
These books also speak of righteousness,

36
00:04:47,015 --> 00:04:52,230
except in some books there has been some sort of interference,

37
00:04:52,694 --> 00:04:57,724
 but most of them speak of spirituality

38
00:04:58,121 --> 00:05:00,854
and what you have to achieve,

39
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,581
what is the purpose of religion.

40
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:15,330
All that is spoken very well, written very well.

41
00:05:16,622 --> 00:05:20,483
 They'll tell you, “You have to be this, you have to be that,

42
00:05:20,752 --> 00:05:23,496
this is not good, that is not good.”

43
00:05:24,051 --> 00:05:28,919
 So even the first state, where the dharma has to be established,

44
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:38,106
was not established:
where people are not supposed to cheat each other,

45
00:05:39,394 --> 00:05:45,151
there has to be justice, there has to be collectivity,

46
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:52,605
there has to be love and understanding, no jealousies,

47
00:05:53,321 --> 00:06:00,321
no hypocrisy; where it's a different race,

48
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,018
a different community,

49
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:06,568
we can call it a different civilization is to be created.

50
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:12,208
Everybody claims that they are the chosen ones,

51
00:06:12,913 --> 00:06:15,217
but they are just the same.

52
00:06:16,352 --> 00:06:21,122
There's a tremendous achievement of Sahaja Yogis

53
00:06:21,722 --> 00:06:25,302
that they have achieved this state of Spirit.

54
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:30,812
So now you can absorb dharma without any difficulties,

55
00:06:31,152 --> 00:06:36,172
without any difficulties. You would not like to cheat anyone,

56
00:06:36,558 --> 00:06:38,558
you'd not like to kill anyone,

57
00:06:38,985 --> 00:06:42,146
you'd not like to be violent with anyone.

58
00:06:42,747 --> 00:06:47,259
You will stick on to the truth, the truth,

59
00:06:47,797 --> 00:06:51,275
very few people can stick on to the truth.

60
00:06:53,554 --> 00:06:58,687
Then you are not people who are going to rob others,

61
00:07:00,036 --> 00:07:06,123
 you have no intention at all, doesn't come into your mind

62
00:07:06,373 --> 00:07:10,361
that you are tempted to take away things from others.

63
00:07:13,146 --> 00:07:16,624
First of all, which is the most important thing,

64
00:07:16,807 --> 00:07:20,832
that you have a rapport with God Almighty;

65
00:07:23,315 --> 00:07:28,720
that you are, in a way, in awe about God.

66
00:07:29,564 --> 00:07:34,357
There is awe, not I would say fear,

67
00:07:34,777 --> 00:07:38,733
because fear is all dispelled, there's no more fear for you,

68
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:45,099
but you have awe for God, that He is God Almighty.

69
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:53,165
You won't cheat people, you won't cheat Sahaja Yoga for money,

70
00:07:54,606 --> 00:08:05,170
you won't fight for power or for something that is material.

71
00:08:06,928 --> 00:08:09,896
All your attention will be towards

72
00:08:10,294 --> 00:08:14,917
the expansion of your awareness in the light of the Spirit.

73
00:08:15,742 --> 00:08:19,282
This is the vision of your Mother,

74
00:08:20,382 --> 00:08:23,782
because Shiva is just a witness,

75
00:08:24,202 --> 00:08:27,363
Sadashiva is just witnessing all this play.

76
00:08:27,703 --> 00:08:31,570
He doesn't have any visions about it,

77
00:08:31,781 --> 00:08:35,474
but now He must have lots of hopes after seeing

78
00:08:36,234 --> 00:08:40,234
the kind of people that are created out of Sahaja Yoga.

79
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:47,031
Very unique, very beautiful,
wonderful angel-like people have been created.

80
00:08:48,026 --> 00:08:54,146
Now only problem is that
you have to keep to your angelic foundations;

81
00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:00,765
but I find that sometimes it happens, doesn't matter,

82
00:09:01,632 --> 00:09:04,541
that you fall, and falter.

83
00:09:05,437 --> 00:09:14,448
Again, you rise into your awareness and try to locate

84
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:26,302
the new dimensions that are available to you,
that you can find out.

85
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:34,733
All this is possible because now
you belong really to the chosen ones’ race.

86
00:09:35,363 --> 00:09:39,532
You must know also that you are very special people.

87
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:43,829
It is not realized sometimes by Sahaja Yogis.

88
00:09:45,408 --> 00:09:49,770
They have no self-esteem as to what they have got.

89
00:09:51,483 --> 00:09:53,852
Once you have self-esteem,

90
00:09:54,241 --> 00:10:01,241
you will have the wisdom to understand
what is your role in this lifetime.

91
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,969
This self-esteem is only possible

92
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:15,121
if you see other people who are lost in the mire of nonsense.

93
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:20,233
Now you are a special community I said,

94
00:10:20,415 --> 00:10:26,695
you are the one who are going to create that great community.

95
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:39,284
Now whatever are the dharma’s

96
00:10:41,484 --> 00:10:45,801
points, or we can say dharma’s aspects,

97
00:10:46,766 --> 00:10:52,727
you can imbibe them Sahaj. “Sahaj” has a very special meaning:

98
00:10:52,887 --> 00:10:56,503
Spontaneously, you do not have to exert,

99
00:10:57,986 --> 00:11:04,986
you do not have to go into a penance or work it out.

100
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:11,972
In a Sahaj way you can do it. “Sahaj” also means easy.

101
00:11:12,948 --> 00:11:17,060
You can have it in your heart, all these qualities,

102
00:11:17,323 --> 00:11:20,155
without any difficulty whatsoever.

103
00:11:21,198 --> 00:11:27,272
It's the easiest thing for you
to be righteous than to be otherwise.

104
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:32,111
It's easier for you to be honest than to be otherwise.

105
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:43,350
So this speciality that you have got
is the vision of all the saints, of all the prophets,

106
00:11:43,585 --> 00:11:49,063
of all the seers, of all the Incarnations,

107
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:56,524
There are lectures and lectures people give,
“You must do like this, you must do that way.”

108
00:11:57,624 --> 00:12:03,811
They think that by educating people into
these principles people will be all right, they cannot.

109
00:12:05,995 --> 00:12:10,652
If you try to educate them, it will go as an ego into their heads,

110
00:12:10,822 --> 00:12:14,727
because you get educated only through your ego.

111
00:12:15,945 --> 00:12:21,614
Is not Sahaj, is not Sahaj sustenance, Sahaja dharana,

112
00:12:21,796 --> 00:12:26,340
it is something that is put

113
00:12:26,608 --> 00:12:28,737
onto you from outside,

114
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:36,954
but for you it is very easy, that you can imbibe

115
00:12:37,365 --> 00:12:40,923
all the aspects of dharma very easily.

116
00:12:41,229 --> 00:12:44,235
You don't have to do anything, you will not just do it.

117
00:12:44,643 --> 00:12:48,184
I've known people who used to take drugs,

118
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:54,780
who used to abuse people, beat. There's one fellow,
he said he used to carry a revolver always with him.

119
00:12:55,041 --> 00:13:00,152
 He's become such a quiet, silent, beautiful person

120
00:13:00,503 --> 00:13:05,061
 that unbelievable, but his wife tells Me that he was like this.

121
00:13:05,508 --> 00:13:08,461
So now you are that special people,

122
00:13:09,312 --> 00:13:14,992
and those people who have not got their Realization

123
00:13:16,677 --> 00:13:19,775
cannot get to dharma easily.

124
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:28,526
Then the second point which is very easy for you

125
00:13:29,172 --> 00:13:36,172
is to love another person, to care for another person.

126
00:13:38,626 --> 00:13:42,232
Is very easy, you would love to do that.

127
00:13:43,902 --> 00:13:51,357
You would love to care for people who are Sahaja Yogis,

128
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,611
also who are non-SahajaYogis.

129
00:13:55,018 --> 00:13:57,311
Sahaja Yoga is quite flexible.

130
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:01,979
If you see somebody who is a non-SahajaYogi

131
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:06,595
and also suffering, you would immediately jump

132
00:14:08,342 --> 00:14:12,296
to see that that person gets help from you.

133
00:14:13,243 --> 00:14:18,490
I have seen people in Sahaja Yoga, very interesting they are.

134
00:14:21,223 --> 00:14:27,660
One gentleman came to Me and said,
“Mother I have no money, I want to go

135
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:31,375
and do some work for Sahaja Yoga

136
00:14:31,506 --> 00:14:35,857
but I have no money, even I have no money for the household.”

137
00:14:36,016 --> 00:14:40,687
I said, “All right, that's very good, you come tomorrow,
I'll give you the money.”

138
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:45,515
Next day he never came. I said, “What's the matter?”

139
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:51,626
He said, “There was somebody
sitting with You that time when I was talking with You,

140
00:14:51,753 --> 00:14:54,921
if You remember.”
I said, “I don't remember so clearly.”

141
00:14:55,064 --> 00:14:57,612
“All right, I also don't know him,

142
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,736
as soon as I went out he said, ‘How much money do you want?’

143
00:15:01,877 --> 00:15:03,913
I told him, ‘At least this much.’

144
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:07,530
Immediately he took out the money and gave it to me.”

145
00:15:07,748 --> 00:15:13,011
So who haven't got something in Sahaja Yoga, who hasn't got money,

146
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:16,914
immediately we run to help that person.

147
00:15:17,164 --> 00:15:22,343
Like you'll be amazed that there are these six countries like

148
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:28,254
Romania, Bulgaria, Russia, Poland,

149
00:15:32,461 --> 00:15:44,168
Czechoslovakia, all these countries, even Hungary, have been helped

150
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,527
by one country or other,

151
00:15:49,604 --> 00:15:53,338
even the East Asian countries are helped by Australians.

152
00:15:53,728 --> 00:15:56,673
I never told them, I never asked them,

153
00:15:56,968 --> 00:15:59,402
I never said that, “You have to help.”

154
00:15:59,552 --> 00:16:03,927
They just came forward that
“Mother, somehow we have to help them,

155
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:10,534
we'll arrange, we'll get to them,
we'll manage this, we'll do that.” It's very surprising,

156
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:17,085
how they could just think of helping those countries.

157
00:16:18,152 --> 00:16:23,027
Then they made tickets for them,

158
00:16:23,512 --> 00:16:26,956
they brought them to India. They looked after,

159
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:31,049
Russians came to India, were looked after.

160
00:16:31,306 --> 00:16:34,285
Everybody was so full of compassion and love

161
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,074
but without feeling they have done anything, without feeling

162
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:40,234
in any way that they have done any obligation to someone.

163
00:16:40,391 --> 00:16:45,479
Nobody expected them to thank them
and write letters of thanks or anything.

164
00:16:46,897 --> 00:16:49,764
Whatever is done is finished now, that's...

165
00:16:51,081 --> 00:16:56,067
Nobody ever asked how much money was given,

166
00:16:56,235 --> 00:17:00,722
how much was spent, how much we had to give, nothing of the kind.

167
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,951
At that spur of the moment everybody
come forward, they gave the money

168
00:17:05,115 --> 00:17:09,001
and the thing worked out. It was very surprising.

169
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:15,892
For example France, France is looking after Romania.

170
00:17:16,372 --> 00:17:19,957
I didn't know they had done so much of work in Romania.

171
00:17:20,096 --> 00:17:26,068
I reached Hungary and suddenly
I find hundred-and-twenty-five Romanians there.

172
00:17:26,261 --> 00:17:30,705
My heart was really filled with such joy.
I said, “How are you here?”

173
00:17:30,857 --> 00:17:35,435
“French have arranged everything for us, Mother.”
“Really?”

174
00:17:35,726 --> 00:17:39,517
There were no French people there, no-one from France.

175
00:17:39,665 --> 00:17:42,455
And Romanians were singing so well

176
00:17:42,732 --> 00:17:46,808
that the Indians felt that,
“Oh wah, what is this, a new group has started?”

177
00:17:46,923 --> 00:17:49,849
All of them, and they never used books, without

178
00:17:49,963 --> 00:17:52,548
using the books they were singing, these Romanians.

179
00:17:52,683 --> 00:17:55,222
So I said, “Where are you going to stay in the night?”

180
00:17:55,358 --> 00:17:57,626
“We'll stay in a garden Mother, it's all right.”

181
00:17:57,732 --> 00:18:01,798
But I said, “How?” “We'll stay there, doesn't matter.”

182
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,267
How secretly they helped.

183
00:18:04,392 --> 00:18:09,789
If I had not asked them, I would not have known how they have come.

184
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:14,477
So this, to help the people who do not have,

185
00:18:14,591 --> 00:18:18,502
you can call them sort of a,
you can say those who are poorer than us.

186
00:18:21,664 --> 00:18:28,855
I have seen also people, how individually they look after others,

187
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:36,574
and bring things for their friends, presents

188
00:18:39,046 --> 00:18:43,663
and beautiful things, just for their own satisfaction,

189
00:18:44,551 --> 00:18:47,227
not to oblige anyone or to

190
00:18:47,615 --> 00:18:50,526
later on say, “Oh I brought this sari for you.” Nothing,

191
00:18:50,675 --> 00:18:53,741
just to see that sari on another Sahaja Yogi.

192
00:18:55,883 --> 00:18:57,952
It's such a beautiful thing.

193
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:03,519
Imagine these countries like England, France, Spain,

194
00:19:06,822 --> 00:19:13,065
Italy, Switzerland, very aggressive, very aggressive people.

195
00:19:13,738 --> 00:19:16,959
When they went out, not to help anyone

196
00:19:17,787 --> 00:19:20,417
but to establish their empire

197
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:28,038
or to destroy people, or to convert them or do
all kinds of things in the name of religion, in the name of God.

198
00:19:29,661 --> 00:19:34,006
But, when you go to other countries, you just want to help,

199
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:38,391
give them all the help that is needed.

200
00:19:38,785 --> 00:19:44,148
I am Myself amazed how it works out so spontaneous in your heart

201
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:48,012
that you should do this and you should work it out.

202
00:19:52,195 --> 00:19:56,029
This transformation that has taken place within you

203
00:19:56,351 --> 00:20:02,223
has brought out all the beauty of your heart,
of your compassion, of your love.

204
00:20:02,613 --> 00:20:05,635
And you give, want to give security to others,

205
00:20:05,818 --> 00:20:10,058
without expecting anything, without demanding anything.

206
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,491
And you all enjoy it, doing that,

207
00:20:14,739 --> 00:20:17,072
living in a simple place like this,

208
00:20:17,976 --> 00:20:21,606
under a tent, sitting, listening to Me,

209
00:20:22,072 --> 00:20:27,922
you don't want any comfort, just seek the comfort of your Spirit

210
00:20:28,246 --> 00:20:31,405
and enjoy the whole place, the Nature.

211
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:36,596
Gradually I have seen also Sahaja Yogis are becoming

212
00:20:36,893 --> 00:20:42,208
extremely conscious of the ecological problem all over the world.

213
00:20:44,393 --> 00:20:48,192
They have started using things which are natural,

214
00:20:48,328 --> 00:20:52,584
which are artistic. It's something so surprising

215
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,402
that suddenly they have taken to artistic things.

216
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,287
I know of a gentleman

217
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:06,418
who had arms, ammunitions in his house, everything like that,

218
00:21:07,382 --> 00:21:10,432
but now he has beautiful things.

219
00:21:11,524 --> 00:21:15,059
Of course the arms and ammunition are on one side

220
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:18,695
but such beautiful artistic things he has collected.

221
00:21:19,242 --> 00:21:21,648
So I said, “How did you get this?”

222
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,509
He said, “Mother I was thinking

223
00:21:23,612 --> 00:21:26,251
that You would like to see them and You'll feel happy,

224
00:21:26,342 --> 00:21:29,029
so I have bought for You to see,

225
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:33,360
and if You want You can take anything.”
I said, “I don't want anything,

226
00:21:33,474 --> 00:21:35,407
you can keep it to yourself.”

227
00:21:36,531 --> 00:21:40,001
So this generosity, we’ll call it adhari,

228
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:43,491
is a sign of an Incarnation.

229
00:21:43,918 --> 00:21:47,856
But this generosity is among My own children now.

230
00:21:48,297 --> 00:21:50,573
They’re extremely generous,

231
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:56,988
and they enjoy giving things to other,
than to in keeping things to themselves.

232
00:21:57,467 --> 00:22:00,379
It has happened not only in Australia,

233
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,860
it has happened all over the world.

234
00:22:03,111 --> 00:22:11,147
If you see the Sahaja Yogis, how they are sacrificing

235
00:22:11,489 --> 00:22:14,426
their time, their money and everything

236
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:18,440
to spread Sahaja Yoga, to help others,

237
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,003
and to accommodate all kinds of things,

238
00:22:23,478 --> 00:22:26,402
all kinds of people within themselves.

239
00:22:27,348 --> 00:22:33,815
Such wisdom, such collective wisdom is there.

240
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:37,530
We don't have to take any consensus.

241
00:22:37,805 --> 00:22:41,889
We don't have to say that “You all must say this” or

242
00:22:42,075 --> 00:22:45,053
“What is your opinion? Will you vote for it?”

243
00:22:45,178 --> 00:22:47,491
Everyone votes for the same.

244
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:52,126
If somebody says, “All right, we have to give some

245
00:22:52,562 --> 00:22:57,707
help to, say, Bulgaria”, in Italy,

246
00:22:58,353 --> 00:23:03,403
immediately all the Italians
brought out their ornaments, everything there.

247
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:07,969
“Mother, how much should wesend?” I said,” It's your lookout.”

248
00:23:08,058 --> 00:23:10,794
And the Bulgarians are surprised also

249
00:23:11,632 --> 00:23:14,410
that, “What have we done for these Italians

250
00:23:14,557 --> 00:23:17,075
that they should come down all the way to

251
00:23:17,178 --> 00:23:20,601
help us out with money, every kind of thing?”

252
00:23:22,829 --> 00:23:26,806
So this compassion, this love,

253
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:31,398
this feeling of oneness, as if they are part and parcel of us,

254
00:23:31,614 --> 00:23:37,303
we are not separate. For Russia, you'll be surprised

255
00:23:38,243 --> 00:23:43,277
 that they sent a television from America.

256
00:23:44,235 --> 00:23:47,590
Now America had nothing to do with Russia,

257
00:23:48,142 --> 00:23:51,060
but must be the Spirit of Shri Krishna

258
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:59,218
trying to help the Spirit of right Agnya, must be.

259
00:24:00,351 --> 00:24:04,211
Such enthusiasm about Russia,

260
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,562
it's unbelievable.

261
00:24:08,755 --> 00:24:13,324
They came in the buses, they came in the trains,
they went all the way

262
00:24:13,449 --> 00:24:16,691
to all these places, to far-fetched places,

263
00:24:20,394 --> 00:24:23,686
and they've achieved tremendous results.

264
00:24:25,546 --> 00:24:29,768
It's not only in Europe they're working it out

265
00:24:30,187 --> 00:24:32,733
around their own cities,

266
00:24:33,369 --> 00:24:37,416
but all the way they are working in Turkey,

267
00:24:38,865 --> 00:24:44,980
they are working in Nepal, and now somebody has gone to Japan.

268
00:24:45,876 --> 00:24:49,561
He is actually not a Japanese,

269
00:24:54,051 --> 00:24:55,661
he is from Rio

270
00:24:57,719 --> 00:25:01,578
and he has gone to Japan, is a physicist,

271
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:06,351
but he is using some sort of a pantomime show

272
00:25:06,578 --> 00:25:11,705
on the streets to attract
the people and telling them about Sahaja Yoga.

273
00:25:12,069 --> 00:25:16,502
He telephoned to Me three, four times,
“Mother, You have beento Australia so many times.

274
00:25:16,786 --> 00:25:18,929
Why don't You come to Japan this time?”

275
00:25:19,043 --> 00:25:22,665
I said, ”All right, next time I will definitely come to

276
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:24,296
Japan,” I promised him,

277
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:28,156
“but this time I'm already programmed you see, by Sahaja Yogis,

278
00:25:29,037 --> 00:25:33,731
so I can't help it. They have fixed Me up everywhere”;

279
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:37,285
and I don't mind because it’s so Sahaj,

280
00:25:37,451 --> 00:25:39,190
to Me it comes Sahaj.

281
00:25:39,305 --> 00:25:42,525
Many people ask Me, “Mother, You are traveling so much,” they say.

282
00:25:42,672 --> 00:25:44,206
I never think about it.

283
00:25:47,764 --> 00:25:55,341
Also, the collectivity you have now is tremendous.

284
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,374
It's not only in Australia you have the collectivity,

285
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:06,027
but the other day I telephoned to someone in India and told them,

286
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:08,441
“I'm buying an ashram in Brisbane.”

287
00:26:08,579 --> 00:26:11,945
They said, “ Mother it's a very great thing. We are very happy.”

288
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:13,748
Now for an Indian,

289
00:26:14,859 --> 00:26:18,793
what is there to be happy if we buy an ashram in Brisbane?

290
00:26:21,315 --> 00:26:23,051
So overjoyed about it.

291
00:26:23,324 --> 00:26:27,450
To them Brisbane is the same as Bombay or Delhi.

292
00:26:32,808 --> 00:26:35,356
The Heart has become so large,

293
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:39,257
because Shiva is shining there, the Spirit is shining.

294
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:41,847
It has become such a large Heart

295
00:26:42,014 --> 00:26:47,185
that it encompasses the whole universe,
I think, the way people look at it,

296
00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:51,811
that's why you all have become universal people.

297
00:26:52,526 --> 00:26:58,732
You don't only read about Vishwa Nirmala Dharma,

298
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:03,899
you don't only knowabout it through your mind,

299
00:27:04,325 --> 00:27:09,392
you don't only try to follow it,
but you have imbibed it within yourself,

300
00:27:10,232 --> 00:27:13,565
which is so Sahaj, which you are not aware of it,

301
00:27:13,761 --> 00:27:16,890
how in a Sahaj way it has come to you.

302
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:22,151
Now you know Australia was full of racialism once upon a time,

303
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,797
nobody was come, allowed to come in here,

304
00:27:26,523 --> 00:27:31,432
might be fifty years back or so, but today in Australia

305
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:33,705
what a change it is!

306
00:27:35,089 --> 00:27:39,156
Though they talked of Christianity and all those things, but

307
00:27:40,373 --> 00:27:43,333
they didn’t think what Christ has said,

308
00:27:43,855 --> 00:27:47,855
they were just the opposite of what Christianity should be.

309
00:27:50,782 --> 00:27:54,516
Islam is the same, Islam talks of very great things,

310
00:27:56,147 --> 00:28:01,912
but it has to be confessed that
the Muslims have nothing to do with Islam.

311
00:28:03,046 --> 00:28:06,773
Is absolutely from outside, if you see Christianity

312
00:28:08,723 --> 00:28:11,919
you have a very, very funny idea about it.

313
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:16,106
If you ask any Hindu gentleman about Christianity

314
00:28:17,932 --> 00:28:21,198
they will say they are the worst possible people,

315
00:28:22,387 --> 00:28:28,919
very cunning, very aggressive
and it takes them no time to kill each other.

316
00:28:30,852 --> 00:28:38,855
Imagine, disciples of Christ;
but if you ask a Christian about a Muslim

317
00:28:39,116 --> 00:28:45,570
he will tell you, “Oh, these Muslims
are the most quarrelsome, dirtiest people ever born,

318
00:28:46,114 --> 00:28:49,176
fundamentalist.” They are all fundamentalist,

319
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:54,780
whether it's a Hindu, Christian, Muslim, anyone,
they're fundamentalist because

320
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:57,259
they are reading one book

321
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,602
and that too, just reading.

322
00:29:00,762 --> 00:29:03,960
The book also doesn't go, if the book goes inside

323
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:06,474
they will realize that all these books

324
00:29:06,633 --> 00:29:10,699
are telling the same thing under different names, that's all.

325
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,895
But that universal thing you have got,

326
00:29:14,031 --> 00:29:18,122
thanks to your Spirit, that was there quite intact

327
00:29:18,303 --> 00:29:21,037
and which has started shining within you.

328
00:29:22,065 --> 00:29:27,019
So we have now a new community, a new civilization

329
00:29:27,201 --> 00:29:35,166
of people who are extremely honest with themselves,
honest to each other.

330
00:29:36,969 --> 00:29:40,431
They are extremely righteous and good people,

331
00:29:41,225 --> 00:29:43,867
they are absolutely non-violent,

332
00:29:44,341 --> 00:29:51,341
absolutely law-abiding, very loving, affectionate,

333
00:29:51,758 --> 00:29:54,809
at the same time extremely constructive,

334
00:29:57,698 --> 00:30:03,457
and at the same time very intelligent.

335
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:09,180
They understand Sahaja Yoga, it's such a subtle subject.

336
00:30:09,396 --> 00:30:11,929
Sahaja Yoga is such a subtle subject,

337
00:30:12,038 --> 00:30:17,027
because you know everybody has failed to make people understand

338
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:19,176
anything about truth.

339
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:26,017
It’s an impossible situation. But this was the trick, your Spirit.

340
00:30:27,446 --> 00:30:31,686
Once your Spirit is enlightened it goes into your head

341
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,281
without any difficulties, absolutely Sahaj.

342
00:30:38,052 --> 00:30:42,777
You don't know how difficult is this subject of Sahaja Yoga.

343
00:30:47,754 --> 00:30:52,051
It is such a fulfillment

344
00:30:56,218 --> 00:30:58,389
for the desire of the Divine

345
00:30:59,716 --> 00:31:03,219
that your  Divinity is now expressing itself.

346
00:31:05,192 --> 00:31:10,163
When you are collective, you are more enjoying each other,

347
00:31:10,447 --> 00:31:18,869
you enjoy collective life. Individualism is against

348
00:31:19,266 --> 00:31:21,376
the spirit of the whole,

349
00:31:25,561 --> 00:31:29,426
but we have our own varieties.

350
00:31:30,144 --> 00:31:35,335
The way you live in other countries, in other atmospheres,

351
00:31:35,551 --> 00:31:40,652
with other traditions, that's how you are living.

352
00:31:45,156 --> 00:31:52,267
But among ourselves we have the same faith,

353
00:31:53,922 --> 00:31:58,011
the faith which is enlightened, which is not blind faith,

354
00:31:58,285 --> 00:32:03,670
enlightened faith, firstly that you are realized souls,

355
00:32:04,063 --> 00:32:07,796
secondly that there is an all-pervading Power.

356
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:14,357
We have the same type of worship, whether it is Christ,

357
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:18,663
whether it is Mohammed Sahib or whether it is Shiva.

358
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:25,462
We all worship it the same way, we do not have a sort of a

359
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:29,445
difference of opinion on that,

360
00:32:31,562 --> 00:32:34,096
like one church becoming ten churches

361
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:39,628
and one Hinduism becoming ten Hinduisms. It's not like that.

362
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:47,492
We are all Sahaja Yogis and we have all got the same principle

363
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:50,871
binding us in a Sahaj manner.

364
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,686
We don't have to say, “Oh we have to be principled,

365
00:32:55,936 --> 00:32:59,603
we have to be on this principle, we are Sahaja Yogis.”

366
00:33:00,544 --> 00:33:05,817
You have to be there, absolutely, because you have to be there.

367
00:33:07,541 --> 00:33:09,443
You just can't help it,

368
00:33:10,237 --> 00:33:15,406
because in your nature now the Spirit is shining.

369
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:23,207
Also, you are becoming archetypes,

370
00:33:23,332 --> 00:33:26,265
I should say, in the real sense of the word,

371
00:33:26,621 --> 00:33:29,807
for the people who are not in Sahaj.

372
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:38,111
Such people are not available anywhere.

373
00:33:39,042 --> 00:33:45,218
When people will see you they will think that what a model it is,
what a model of life.

374
00:33:45,434 --> 00:33:48,153
They don't drink, they don't smoke,

375
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:51,132
they don't boast of it, they don't hate anyone,

376
00:33:51,235 --> 00:33:56,869
they love anyone, they are so dynamic, they are so creative,

377
00:33:57,412 --> 00:34:02,690
they are so constructive, they are so self-contented.

378
00:34:04,107 --> 00:34:06,717
They are not at all competitive,

379
00:34:07,772 --> 00:34:13,463
they cause no problem to Nature, they cause no problem to anything.

380
00:34:17,516 --> 00:34:20,182
They have become such beautiful people.

381
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,399
Who are these people?

382
00:34:23,404 --> 00:34:27,472
Such beautiful people are the models. So now,

383
00:34:27,756 --> 00:34:30,889
individually you have to understand this part,

384
00:34:31,033 --> 00:34:36,350
that we have to be models in this country of Australia.

385
00:34:37,751 --> 00:34:47,976
Model of good behavior, good language, decent life,

386
00:34:48,384 --> 00:34:53,200
decorous life, not fighting with husband,

387
00:34:53,315 --> 00:34:56,173
fighting with wife, you see you open any television,

388
00:34:56,275 --> 00:34:58,407
just get a headache, I mean there's, there's no other

389
00:34:58,486 --> 00:35:03,275
thing but a husband fighting wife and a wife fighting husband.

390
00:35:05,374 --> 00:35:08,021
There should be wisdom about it.

391
00:35:09,665 --> 00:35:13,999
Fighting among yourselves, you see if so many people have gather

392
00:35:14,246 --> 00:35:18,182
in a pub what will happen that pub will burst out.

393
00:35:20,631 --> 00:35:22,832
They can never sit silently.

394
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:29,156
The mayor of Cabella told Me, “It surprises me

395
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:34,047
that in the church we are sitting for half an hour then we start

396
00:35:34,309 --> 00:35:39,109
nudging each other. ‘How long 
is it going to take now? Better get out.’

397
00:35:39,669 --> 00:35:44,669
You get tired; and what are 
these people doing for hours together with You?

398
00:35:45,005 --> 00:35:49,021
How are they so spellbound? They don't feel tired.

399
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:55,920
I think they are special people.” I said, “They are, they are.”

400
00:35:59,435 --> 00:36:03,242
“But what do they do?” “They don't do anything,

401
00:36:03,808 --> 00:36:09,120
they are just enjoying.” He couldn't understand that

402
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,809
once we had a Puja, Guru Puja, for about six hours altogether,

403
00:36:14,015 --> 00:36:17,721
and they were surprised that how these people are sitting;

404
00:36:17,868 --> 00:36:22,967
and all the people they were, 
all the villagers, mostly they are elderly,

405
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,771
they thought that these angels have come from somewhere,

406
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:30,263
they are angelic people: they don't trouble you,

407
00:36:30,462 --> 00:36:33,566
they don't torture you, they look after you,

408
00:36:33,748 --> 00:36:40,561
they try to be kind to you, not only that but they try to

409
00:36:41,253 --> 00:36:49,657
bring joy to you. They were so surprised in that village.

410
00:36:50,534 --> 00:36:53,291
First they used to call Me “Princess”.

411
00:36:53,426 --> 00:36:56,072
Then they started calling Me “Goddess”,

412
00:36:56,197 --> 00:36:57,954
then they said,” You are Madonna.”

413
00:36:58,071 --> 00:37:01,912
Whatever they could think of the best, they started

414
00:37:02,491 --> 00:37:08,655
saying all those things. They want now to come to Sahaja Yoga,

415
00:37:10,174 --> 00:37:14,528
but I said, “Let us see now.” 
After some time, we'll work it out for them also.

416
00:37:16,581 --> 00:37:19,075
They are so nice now by seeing

417
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:22,703
how the Sahaja Yogis are, because I seldom go out;

418
00:37:22,885 --> 00:37:25,642
but seeing the way Sahaja Yogis are,

419
00:37:25,835 --> 00:37:28,952
that the land behind the house

420
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:33,250
was not even given to Prince Dorio 
who was willing to pay lot of money,

421
00:37:33,374 --> 00:37:35,737
because he wanted to have a road that way;

422
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:39,413
but to Me they rushed forward

423
00:37:41,215 --> 00:37:45,192
and at a very nominal price they gave Me that land.

424
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,639
They said, “It is for You only, please have it.”

425
00:37:50,216 --> 00:37:53,839
The whole village is getting into transformation.

426
00:37:57,955 --> 00:38:02,002
But the dedication you have is very remarkable,

427
00:38:03,658 --> 00:38:06,467
surprises Me, really surprises Me.

428
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,388
I have never taught you much,

429
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:14,375
but the way you are dedicated in everything!

430
00:38:18,744 --> 00:38:23,447
Everyone who is not a Sahaja Yogi

431
00:38:24,286 --> 00:38:31,876
will be charmed the way you are dedicated to Sahaja Yoga, to Me.

432
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:37,653
Sometimes I think, “What have I done? I have done nothing.”

433
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:42,993
You had your Kundalini, you had your Spirit, that's all,

434
00:38:44,898 --> 00:38:52,312
but such a difference, with little distance you covered,

435
00:38:52,924 --> 00:38:54,965
and such a difference!

436
00:38:55,849 --> 00:39:00,105
Can you imagine an Indian woman coming to Australia,

437
00:39:00,661 --> 00:39:06,302
finding this love, this affection and this dedication? 
Unbelievable!

438
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:14,236
They all think that I must be mesmerizing you.

439
00:39:14,837 --> 00:39:18,515
Nobody can believe that you could be that dedicated,

440
00:39:18,651 --> 00:39:21,347
take so much trouble, so much care;

441
00:39:21,563 --> 00:39:24,304
I mean just imagine the flowers that you have brought,

442
00:39:24,423 --> 00:39:26,549
just imagine all this you have done,

443
00:39:26,628 --> 00:39:29,222
I mean just imagine the way they brought another

444
00:39:29,313 --> 00:39:33,723
big car so that your Mother should be 
brought here without any difficulty.

445
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,095
All this love,

446
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:43,041
all this affection, this care, I never asked for anything.

447
00:39:43,324 --> 00:39:45,180
I could have walked down,

448
00:39:45,274 --> 00:39:49,103
if you had said we have to walk, 
I would have walked, I would never have said no.

449
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,695
I never expected all this thing.

450
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:56,253
But the way you want to express your love to Me,

451
00:39:56,356 --> 00:40:03,589
this dedication is so much and you sacrifice so much for that.

452
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:07,529
Really you are sacrificing quite a lot,

453
00:40:10,273 --> 00:40:17,268
your time, your effort, to come 
all the way to this far-off place for this Puja.

454
00:40:19,954 --> 00:40:23,841
All the gain that you have from Puja is only possible

455
00:40:24,113 --> 00:40:28,602
when you are a realized soul, otherwise it is useless

456
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:34,215
to do any Puja, any worship. People go to church,

457
00:40:34,737 --> 00:40:37,202
sing few hymns and come back.

458
00:40:37,293 --> 00:40:40,827
They are just the same and afterwards go to the pub,

459
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,960
because they think pub is the only place 
where they can get some joy.

460
00:40:46,637 --> 00:40:51,606
One has to exert, one has to sacrifice,

461
00:40:51,911 --> 00:40:54,414
though I may say that Sahaja Yoga is the easiest thing.

462
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:58,486
You don't have to go to 
Himalayas to stand on your heads and all that,

463
00:40:58,577 --> 00:41:04,779
but still you have to sacrifice your time, your attention.

464
00:41:05,906 --> 00:41:10,859
Formerly you might be going to some rock music,

465
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:15,238
you might be going to some pubs also,

466
00:41:15,418 --> 00:41:18,977
you might be enjoying all these things; 
but you have given up everything,

467
00:41:19,115 --> 00:41:21,982
without My telling you, just have given up

468
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,132
and you are so pure now.

469
00:41:24,903 --> 00:41:28,903
Your attention is so pure you can't enjoy all these things.

470
00:41:30,481 --> 00:41:34,548
Don't you think it's very remarkable that this has happened?

471
00:41:35,723 --> 00:41:39,317
This community, I don't have to tell you,

472
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:44,054
I don't have to educate, I must say

473
00:41:44,213 --> 00:41:46,946
that all these things you have given up.

474
00:41:47,444 --> 00:41:51,841
Suddenly I find all of you have become so clean,

475
00:41:52,103 --> 00:41:54,982
so beautiful, your chakras so clean.

476
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:03,555
Is it that these are your purva punyas that is working out?

477
00:42:05,211 --> 00:42:09,062
But still I would say you must know your self-esteem,

478
00:42:09,165 --> 00:42:13,165
that you are Sahaja Yogis, and how can you behave like this

479
00:42:13,269 --> 00:42:18,539
if you are a Sahaja Yogi? You cannot. Now you are a Sahaja Yogi,

480
00:42:19,027 --> 00:42:23,947
so that dignity, that wisdom has to be there;

481
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:32,420
the compassion, the love, the unity of purpose should be there.

482
00:42:34,154 --> 00:42:37,650
All over the world you have brothers and sisters,

483
00:42:37,766 --> 00:42:42,312
this brotherhood and sisterhood is everywhere.

484
00:42:42,562 --> 00:42:46,901
You have rakhi sisters, you have very pure relationships.

485
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:51,742
Anything impure is just thrown out in a Sahaj manner.

486
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:56,435
Those who do not fit into it just get out of it.

487
00:42:59,769 --> 00:43:05,310
We have now very beautiful families, very beautiful children,

488
00:43:06,274 --> 00:43:12,742
it's, just think of it. 
Moses saved some Jews but what are they good for, nothing,

489
00:43:14,455 --> 00:43:17,571
what's the use of saving such people?

490
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:24,124
Then Christ came and talked about this thing,

491
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,731
and this is what has happened to Christianity.

492
00:43:30,412 --> 00:43:34,896
Mohammed came and talked of very nice things, I must tell you.

493
00:43:35,024 --> 00:43:38,026
He never made it a rigid religion, never.

494
00:43:38,243 --> 00:43:42,074
It was very flexible, and He said, “You must get the knowledge.”

495
00:43:42,188 --> 00:43:44,963
So according to them, knowledge was to read the book

496
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,354
and to interpret it and to be an intellectual.

497
00:43:52,821 --> 00:43:56,470
After that came Guru Nanaka also, you know that.

498
00:43:56,709 --> 00:43:59,924
What has happened to Sikhs, where they have gone?

499
00:44:00,049 --> 00:44:02,716
“Sikh” means the person who has learnt,

500
00:44:03,115 --> 00:44:05,244
learnt the Divine laws.

501
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:10,723
If I say you have to follow the Divine laws, how? 
You are not connected,

502
00:44:10,972 --> 00:44:13,727
you don't know what are the Divine laws are.

503
00:44:13,852 --> 00:44:16,919
Just follow: “We want to follow Divine laws.”

504
00:44:17,503 --> 00:44:20,437
Now you are hanging somewhere on this earth,

505
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:23,134
the Divine laws are working there,

506
00:44:23,282 --> 00:44:25,717
how are you going to work out the Divine laws

507
00:44:25,813 --> 00:44:27,546
if you are not connected?

508
00:44:28,023 --> 00:44:31,423
But you know immediately what are the Divine laws;

509
00:44:31,562 --> 00:44:34,432
you are going against it, as soon as you go against it

510
00:44:34,523 --> 00:44:38,323
you know you can feel it on your central nervous system.

511
00:44:38,502 --> 00:44:44,509
You can feel it on your hands, 
that you are doing something against the Divine laws.

512
00:44:45,472 --> 00:44:48,667
Immediately you know and if you are alert

513
00:44:48,759 --> 00:44:52,727
you'll immediately try to change. You'll think,

514
00:44:53,725 --> 00:44:59,332
“That's not correct, this is the truth about myself.”

515
00:44:59,468 --> 00:45:02,005
You start judging yourself all the time

516
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:07,595
and you want to put yourself right 
because you don't like it that way.

517
00:45:09,183 --> 00:45:13,658
So many ideas you have about your personal life

518
00:45:14,474 --> 00:45:17,011
are that, you see, there should be

519
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:21,686
“a wife who should spoil me” or “a husband who should spoil me”,

520
00:45:21,778 --> 00:45:25,511
“My child should be like this”, and - all finished now.

521
00:45:26,199 --> 00:45:29,894
What do you want? “I want a real Sahaja Yogini”,

522
00:45:30,574 --> 00:45:33,296
“I want a real Sahaja Yogi to marry”,

523
00:45:33,422 --> 00:45:36,622
and after that the marriage becomes a blessing.

524
00:45:36,948 --> 00:45:42,276
How? How these flowers have come out, that's how.

525
00:45:44,023 --> 00:45:47,603
It's all innately built within you, all this beauty.

526
00:45:47,728 --> 00:45:54,786
You just start showing, but it has to sprout, it has to come up.

527
00:46:01,896 --> 00:46:07,492
This penance, so-called, is no penance to you.

528
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:11,097
They say “We are enjoying this place”, I mean it's a

529
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,109
place for penance only, the way things are here,

530
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:19,735
there are not even closed bathrooms.

531
00:46:20,302 --> 00:46:24,302
People are finding it rather difficult to take a bath even.

532
00:46:25,228 --> 00:46:31,484
It's quite a penance to come to such a far-fetched place,

533
00:46:31,768 --> 00:46:35,654
or to travel in Maharashtra is another big penance.

534
00:46:35,801 --> 00:46:40,958
But you enjoy it, I mean you were missing; they said, 
“We are missing our buses.” I said, “Really?

535
00:46:43,472 --> 00:46:48,982
I thought you would be happy. “No, no, Mother we are missing.” 
I mean it was an adventure for them,

536
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:55,683
they liked the way they were jostled and they were given hiccups,

537
00:46:55,842 --> 00:46:57,618
they’re very happy about it,

538
00:46:57,721 --> 00:47:01,097
that all this was, this was like an adventure.

539
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:04,181
Everything which we call as tapasya

540
00:47:04,635 --> 00:47:07,954
or as the penance becomes an adventure for them,

541
00:47:08,057 --> 00:47:11,190
and the way they describe is very interesting.

542
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:14,902
Like these musicians, they went to Russia and got lost,

543
00:47:15,027 --> 00:47:21,094
and when they came back, and they were describing the 
whole thing with such description,

544
00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:25,569
as if God was just taking them from places to places.

545
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:30,737
And how they were helped every moment, how they came

546
00:47:30,953 --> 00:47:35,680
to Italy sudden and how they came to Milan, to the ashram.

547
00:47:35,885 --> 00:47:38,966
The whole description is tremendous.

548
00:47:41,585 --> 00:47:48,323
Now think of what you have achieved, but you can't even think,

549
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:50,565
you just achieve.

550
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:59,784
Without thinking you achieve things, 
is the blessing of your Spirit, blessing of Shiva.

551
00:48:00,907 --> 00:48:06,064
The Spirit is the witness and you develop that witness state.

552
00:48:07,085 --> 00:48:11,232
To you all this looks like a funny stage

553
00:48:11,335 --> 00:48:14,259
where people are doing this and that, politics, economics,

554
00:48:14,385 --> 00:48:16,775
you see as something absurd.

555
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:21,296
I went down to Russia, there were so many Russians.

556
00:48:21,662 --> 00:48:26,372
I told them that there's a very bad shape the politics is here now

557
00:48:26,508 --> 00:48:29,238
and you are having very bad times with your food.

558
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:32,934
“No, Mother, we have no problem with food or anything,

559
00:48:33,058 --> 00:48:36,899
but what do we care? We have got the spiritual food,

560
00:48:37,172 --> 00:48:41,341
let these people fight, do whatever, we are not bothered.”

561
00:48:43,133 --> 00:48:48,066
They were least bothered as there was a coup or anything, 
least bothered.

562
00:48:48,939 --> 00:48:51,758
“Let them fight, let them do what they like,

563
00:48:51,927 --> 00:48:55,844
we are in a different situation.”

564
00:48:56,037 --> 00:49:00,056
I said, “Which situation you are?” “We are in the Kingdom of God,”

565
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:01,391
they told Me,

566
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:08,521
“We are in the Kingdom of God, why should we worry 
about these kingdoms and things, let them fight.”

567
00:49:08,682 --> 00:49:13,044
Such contented people, so very beautiful.

568
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,403
You have so many brothers and sisters there.

569
00:49:16,517 --> 00:49:20,428
Early in the morning I got up and they had, I don't know when,

570
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:26,161
planted flowers on the road of My house there,

571
00:49:28,168 --> 00:49:31,229
flowers all along, rows after rows.

572
00:49:31,388 --> 00:49:36,284
I don't know when they came, when they did it and disappeared.

573
00:49:36,591 --> 00:49:40,613
So sweet, I tell you, except for

574
00:49:41,963 --> 00:49:45,670
crying with joy  I didn't know what to say.

575
00:49:46,391 --> 00:49:48,230
If this happens all over,

576
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,964
what a world we can have.

577
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,805
There are of course some people who are exceptional, 
who are troublesome,

578
00:49:55,942 --> 00:50:02,289
who are not all right; it's all right, forget about them.

579
00:50:06,598 --> 00:50:16,953
So now, you are the people who have understood what is God,

580
00:50:18,439 --> 00:50:24,796
what is Sadashiva. Now you have faith in Him which is not blind,

581
00:50:25,171 --> 00:50:28,026
you also know that His powers work,

582
00:50:28,355 --> 00:50:32,955
that His laws work, all other laws are useless, 
only His laws works.

583
00:50:37,551 --> 00:50:40,915
You have seen, experienced in your lifetime

584
00:50:41,267 --> 00:50:45,539
how miracles are taking place, how things are working out.

585
00:50:45,687 --> 00:50:48,918
A simple miracle I would say, it was desired

586
00:50:49,066 --> 00:50:52,796
that Shiva Puja should be around some hills,

587
00:50:53,397 --> 00:50:55,525
but they couldn't arrange,

588
00:50:55,662 --> 00:51:01,148
they were trying for some other place 
which could not be arranged, so you are here.

589
00:51:01,364 --> 00:51:07,078
You desire and it works, as if your desire acts.

590
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:13,379
But we have some people who are still mediocre,

591
00:51:13,549 --> 00:51:16,298
who are behaving in a mediocre manner,

592
00:51:16,411 --> 00:51:19,477
very dull, some of them are very dull people.

593
00:51:19,847 --> 00:51:21,847
They cannot understand Sahaj,

594
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:26,131
they don't understand how much they can gain out of it.

595
00:51:26,415 --> 00:51:29,643
So you shouldn't worry about them.

596
00:51:30,845 --> 00:51:35,494
Then you have to think about the whole collective which is good

597
00:51:35,755 --> 00:51:39,088
and one or two useless people, forget about them.

598
00:51:39,574 --> 00:51:42,519
If they come up well and good, if they don't come up,

599
00:51:42,644 --> 00:51:45,127
we are not going to force them.

600
00:51:45,718 --> 00:51:50,454
We'll be getting more and more people, more and more people.

601
00:51:51,543 --> 00:51:54,387
I'm sure it will happen.

602
00:51:55,384 --> 00:51:59,651
But the greatest thing you have got is the complete integration

603
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:08,263
within your being: your heart, your mind,

604
00:52:10,667 --> 00:52:15,959
your liver I should say, your attention, are all integrated.

605
00:52:17,082 --> 00:52:20,069
There's no quarrel, there's no struggle

606
00:52:20,889 --> 00:52:27,427
between your heart and your mind, heart and your brain.

607
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:33,152
Whatever your brain thinks, your heart accepts,

608
00:52:33,435 --> 00:52:37,601
whatever your heart wants, your brain accepts,

609
00:52:37,794 --> 00:52:43,463
whatever your attention is there, is completely integrated

610
00:52:44,209 --> 00:52:47,928
with your heart and with your brain.

611
00:52:49,652 --> 00:52:53,852
You must see the other people, they don't want to do something

612
00:52:54,617 --> 00:52:58,140
but they have to do it because they’re habituated.

613
00:52:58,301 --> 00:53:01,881
So many people told Me: “We want to give up this, we can't.”

614
00:53:02,006 --> 00:53:05,744
Once you have got the Spirit, you get that power

615
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:09,683
that you can surpass all the said temptations,

616
00:53:09,804 --> 00:53:13,509
not only temptations, also the differentiations

617
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,602
that you always make: “This is that, this is that.”

618
00:53:16,728 --> 00:53:22,396
But you integrate, you integrate among yourselves,

619
00:53:23,077 --> 00:53:25,886
you integrate among different states,

620
00:53:26,011 --> 00:53:29,047
you integrate among different countries.

621
00:53:30,805 --> 00:53:35,450
The whole cosmos seems to be integrated, woven

622
00:53:36,188 --> 00:53:41,961
and governed by the Divine laws.

623
00:53:44,546 --> 00:53:51,655
This integration gives you a complete understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

624
00:53:54,522 --> 00:54:02,763
mentally, emotionally and spiritually.

625
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:12,172
It’s not by some sort of a brain-washing

626
00:54:12,762 --> 00:54:19,165
or bombarding, but just through the light of Spirit 
you have seen the truth

627
00:54:20,265 --> 00:54:25,217
and you have understood it. Also you have so many powers.

628
00:54:26,351 --> 00:54:30,551
You do not want to exert, that's a different point altogether,

629
00:54:30,988 --> 00:54:32,518
but just try.

630
00:54:34,798 --> 00:54:39,863
One word of prayer from you is very powerful

631
00:54:39,888 --> 00:54:43,775
than hundreds of prayers of these people.

632
00:54:47,483 --> 00:54:52,244
One asking is much more powerful

633
00:54:53,205 --> 00:54:55,776
than thousands of these askings.

634
00:54:56,151 --> 00:54:58,961
You have never tried that; try that,

635
00:54:59,494 --> 00:55:03,427
you are extremely powerful, whatever you desire works out.

636
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:10,285
You have other powers of giving Realization,

637
00:55:10,603 --> 00:55:13,070
also curing, you have so many powers

638
00:55:13,665 --> 00:55:17,298
but most of the time you'll bring somebody to Me to be cured.

639
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:20,110
No, no, there's no need.

640
00:55:20,428 --> 00:55:24,561
You have given all powers; you have all the powers, use them.

641
00:55:25,338 --> 00:55:29,916
Don't be afraid, use these powers, and you will be amazed

642
00:55:30,472 --> 00:55:32,789
how these power work out,

643
00:55:34,286 --> 00:55:44,109
and how you become more and more embedded in your faith, 
in yourself.

644
00:55:47,045 --> 00:55:49,616
Of course there are Sahaja Yogis

645
00:55:49,934 --> 00:55:53,585
who are made to sit on the throne but still they are begging,

646
00:55:53,676 --> 00:55:55,881
what can you do about it?

647
00:55:58,421 --> 00:56:03,443
You are so very powerful in collective and also individually.

648
00:56:05,882 --> 00:56:08,737
Whatever you want, you can have it.

649
00:56:09,656 --> 00:56:13,096
I am desireless because the Divine,

650
00:56:14,281 --> 00:56:20,410
the Divine power is working for Me, everything 
- I don't have to desire - it knows.

651
00:56:21,714 --> 00:56:24,981
I don't desire anything, but you have to desire,

652
00:56:26,742 --> 00:56:30,394
you have to pray, you have to ask.

653
00:56:30,712 --> 00:56:34,554
And the wider you become your prayers will be wider,

654
00:56:34,702 --> 00:56:37,581
for a wider world, wider vision,

655
00:56:38,012 --> 00:56:41,348
not limited to your children, not limited to your family,

656
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:47,289
not limited to one place, but unlimited areas you'll cover.

657
00:56:53,462 --> 00:56:58,156
So we become very conscious and alert

658
00:56:58,701 --> 00:57:03,619
about whatever is happening in the world 
to put our attention there.

659
00:57:03,778 --> 00:57:08,197
We try to find out what's wrong with this 
and what's wrong with that.

660
00:57:08,334 --> 00:57:11,347
We are not just worried about a small little ashram,

661
00:57:11,449 --> 00:57:15,689
but we are worried about the whole world to find out what's wrong,

662
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,873
what can we do, what can we desire,

663
00:57:17,953 --> 00:57:24,222
because if we have the power, 
and if we can operate the Divine power,

664
00:57:25,467 --> 00:57:29,016
then why not we work it out ourselves? We can.

665
00:57:29,334 --> 00:57:32,108
So your attention can go to any place.

666
00:57:32,189 --> 00:57:34,059
It can go to Nicaragua,

667
00:57:37,212 --> 00:57:44,012
it can go to Israel, it can go to Saddam Hussein, 
to any place that you want to work it out.

668
00:57:44,522 --> 00:57:47,199
It moves, it's mobile, it's universal.

669
00:57:48,538 --> 00:57:55,471
Just start expanding your heart, your mind and your attention.

670
00:58:01,319 --> 00:58:08,039
Your faith in Me, I must say, is great. 
I am Myself surprised at that.

671
00:58:15,729 --> 00:58:17,744
I am quite a camouflage.

672
00:58:18,992 --> 00:58:22,925
It's not easy to understand Me, I don't understand Myself!

673
00:58:30,339 --> 00:58:34,718
On one side of course I'm Divine, no doubt,

674
00:58:36,453 --> 00:58:39,500
on the other side, I am very human.

675
00:58:40,657 --> 00:58:46,505
Even in a film, if I see somebody suffering, 
I start crying, can't bear.

676
00:58:47,208 --> 00:58:51,416
I can't cure children because I can't see their sufferings.

677
00:58:51,609 --> 00:58:57,169
It's another aspect of Mine. I’ve made Myself extremely human,

678
00:59:01,512 --> 00:59:07,772
and this Divinity of Mine also is just Sahaj.

679
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,744
I've done nothing,

680
00:59:11,459 --> 00:59:15,926
I've been like this and I'm like this, I've not achieved anything.

681
00:59:16,221 --> 00:59:20,288
If I've achieved anything, is understanding of human beings,

682
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:24,688
because I always felt that all these Incarnations

683
00:59:24,858 --> 00:59:30,082
and all these prophets never understood human beings.

684
00:59:30,253 --> 00:59:33,867
They never knew that they are not enlightened people

685
00:59:33,969 --> 00:59:38,187
and no use talking to them of these great things, it’s all a waste.

686
00:59:38,301 --> 00:59:40,067
It's like a blind person,

687
00:59:40,464 --> 00:59:44,664
you explain to him all the colors and the beauty of the stage.

688
00:59:49,115 --> 01:00:00,795
And so this human realization, 
I should, that I had, is so beautiful.

689
01:00:03,278 --> 01:00:06,953
Now I understand what is the joy of bhakti,

690
01:00:07,975 --> 01:00:11,339
what is the joy of gnyana,

691
01:00:12,836 --> 01:00:19,480
what is the joy of karma, because a person 
who doesn't do anything,

692
01:00:20,775 --> 01:00:29,941
a person who has no bhakti and who has no gnyana

693
01:00:34,806 --> 01:00:37,282
is just wakened completely.

694
01:00:39,664 --> 01:00:42,636
I had to fill in Myself with all these things

695
01:00:42,761 --> 01:00:45,368
that I have to know the gnyana,

696
01:00:45,505 --> 01:00:49,232
not the gnyana of the Divine because after all that is,

697
01:00:49,369 --> 01:00:55,184
that is not difficult, because if I am that, I know that,

698
01:00:55,718 --> 01:00:58,648
but the gnyana of the human beings,

699
01:01:00,247 --> 01:01:06,018
the problems of the human beings, I had to study for years

700
01:01:06,676 --> 01:01:11,605
the human beings to work it out.

701
01:01:13,147 --> 01:01:15,401
But once it has worked,

702
01:01:17,442 --> 01:01:22,842
that's what is said that there is Divinity in 
you has started expressing itself,

703
01:01:24,029 --> 01:01:28,165
and such beautiful Divine lights are sitting before Me.

704
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:35,578
I bless you all from My heart where resides the Shiva, 
the Sadashiva,

705
01:01:36,474 --> 01:01:38,603
and Sadashiva blesses you.

706
01:01:39,147 --> 01:01:43,521
He is a innocent personality, absolutely innocent.

707
01:01:44,111 --> 01:01:50,814
He is the One who is beyond any attachments,

708
01:01:54,828 --> 01:01:57,161
absolutely beyond any attachments.

709
01:01:58,642 --> 01:02:06,396
He is the One who is watching, 
watching all of you with such admiration,

710
01:02:07,587 --> 01:02:17,027
His joy knows no bounds, it's tremendous, 
as if He is dancing with joy.

711
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:26,415
It's a great day for us to celebrate this Shiva Puja here.

712
01:02:26,801 --> 01:02:31,198
I hope all of you respect the principle of Shiva within you,

713
01:02:31,311 --> 01:02:33,482
that's the most important.

714
01:02:33,766 --> 01:02:41,770
And look after your vibrations, which pulsates in your being,

715
01:02:42,088 --> 01:02:47,101
because the Spirit has awakened in your attention,

716
01:02:47,453 --> 01:02:50,398
in your central nervous system.

717
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:53,780
That's the most important thing you have to do.

718
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:57,416
The rest of it is Sahaj.

719
01:02:59,448 --> 01:03:02,157
The rest of it is absolutely Sahaj.

720
01:03:02,575 --> 01:03:04,675
May God bless you all.
