General Content:
Science and our mental projections are not

00:52.920 --> 00:57.109
connected to higher, living force, so they
fail us.

00:57.109 --> 01:02.929
Biological movement within us is spiral, but
mental projections are linear, dead.

01:02.929 --> 01:09.929
We must become scientists of the Divine, and
understand the knowledge of the roots.

01:11.520 --> 01:17.120
We are all One; all of God’s children – no
nationalities exist.

01:17.120 --> 01:24.120
You can find information about the Holy Ghost
in the Bible, but you must go to Indian scriptures

01:27.920 --> 01:32.640
to find information about the ‘Adi Shakti’.
Doctors must learn about the three sides of

01:32.640 --> 01:39.320
a human: physical, mental and emotional.
With Sahaja Yoga you can cure yourself and

01:39.320 --> 01:42.890
others.
You cannot pay for Kundalini rising – if

01:42.890 --> 01:48.000
you could, or did, it would no longer be benevolent.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.620
Question Period Following Talk:
What happens to our Spirit after death?

01:53.620 --> 01:56.690
Does self-realization interfere with normal
functioning?

01:56.690 --> 02:03.690
Story of a woman with a serious heart problem.
Where does depression come from and can Sahaja

02:06.880 --> 02:11.049
Yoga cure it?
Is meditation difficult?

02:11.049 --> 02:13.790
What is the evidence of Shri Mataji’s own
enlightenment?

02:13.790 --> 02:16.170
Self-Realization Exercise:
Shri Mataji finishes the talk by giving the

02:16.170 --> 02:19.260
audience self-realization, and She comments
on left vishuddi guilt problems.

02:19.260 --> 02:26.260
What is the purpose of our life? Is it that
the whole evolution is purposeless; that there

02:29.170 --> 02:36.170
is no Divine play in it? Then why it was done
with such care, and why we have become human

02:39.579 --> 02:46.579
beings? So first, we have to come to right
conclusions - that is the counseling you can

02:47.450 --> 02:54.450
call it – we have come, we have to understand,
that we have not become what we are supposed

02:54.879 --> 03:01.879
to be. That’s why we are in confusion. We
do not have answers for these fundamental

03:02.099 --> 03:08.859
questions. Some believe in God, some don’t
believe in God. Some believe in Christ, some

03:08.859 --> 03:15.859
believe in Mohammed. Some believe in Krishna,
some say that it’s all science. We are so

03:16.299 --> 03:21.209
confused, and there is no answer to it. The
reason is we are not that what we have to

03:21.209 --> 03:25.969
be.
Supposing an instrument is given to you, and

03:25.969 --> 03:32.969
you don’t know anything about that. Then
you don’t know what is the purpose of that

03:34.639 --> 03:41.639
instrument, and for which it was created,
and to what use it has to be put. Thus, there’s

03:45.719 --> 03:50.290
a confusion, and the confusion is to such
an extent that in that confusion we have formed,

03:50.290 --> 03:53.120
from ideas, mental projections. Artificial,
without any biological basis for it. There

03:53.120 --> 03:57.409
is no biological basis for our mental projections.
Just sit down here, and think now, that see,

03:57.409 --> 04:04.409
this kind of a government if you make, then
people will be alright. This is your own mental

04:06.579 --> 04:10.810
projection. It has nothing living behind it;
it’s all dead thought. By changing the governments,

04:10.810 --> 04:17.630
have you been able to transform the people?
I have been to Russia, I have been to China,

04:17.630 --> 04:24.630
I have been to America, to all these places.
Human beings are just the same; there is no

04:25.140 --> 04:30.470
difference whatsoever. Maybe some are more
honest, some are more dishonest, some are

04:30.470 --> 04:35.670
more immoral, some are less immoral, but,
on the balance, if you see you find any kind

04:35.670 --> 04:42.470
of person everywhere. So one has to understand
that this kind of mental projection that we

04:42.470 --> 04:47.410
were having about other things like social
work, people think that being social work

04:47.410 --> 04:49.560
and all that, our ego can be conquered. The
greatest egoistical people are the social

04:49.560 --> 04:51.050
workers.
Now these mental projections have created

04:51.050 --> 04:54.120
also lots of norms for us. Like, I sit down
here and decide I’ll give a title to someone.

04:54.120 --> 04:58.720
Now he becomes a titlehood. Then he’s off,
finished, once for all he’s dead now to

04:58.720 --> 05:01.290
anything that is reality because he’s living
with something so unreal, which was given

05:01.290 --> 05:05.040
to him by somebody which is so unreal. There’s
nothing living force behind it. Have you seen

05:05.040 --> 05:12.040
any man changing by getting some sort of a
title or lot of money? On the contrary he

05:12.140 --> 05:19.140
becomes worse, never improves. So what is
the reason? Why is it that when we go into

05:19.650 --> 05:26.650
an enterprise of this kind, why is it, we
find, that everything fails? You talk of democracy,

05:27.460 --> 05:34.120
it becomes demonocracy. You talk of communism,
you find it is another headache. You talk

05:34.120 --> 05:40.690
of anything, it all becomes such a funny thing,
and it recoils back (to you?). Whatever you

05:40.690 --> 05:47.250
try, any enterprise, it recoils back. Science,
what is science now has become nothing but

05:47.250 --> 05:54.250
atomic war. How is it science (wandered/wanted/come?)
into atomic war no one knows, but suddenly

05:55.000 --> 05:59.820
it has become a great threat to the whole
world. Computers, tomorrow computers will

05:59.820 --> 06:05.920
start dominating us. We see those things clearly
happening to us, and we are worried, we are

06:05.920 --> 06:12.920
shocked. (But/Well?) we don’t know why is
it whatever we try to do, why, it recoils

06:15.800 --> 06:22.800
on us, and entangles us, and enslaves us.
The reason is it’s, it has no living force

06:24.940 --> 06:31.830
behind it. It’s only mental, at mental level,
and human beings live only on mental level.

06:31.830 --> 06:38.830
So there has to be another higher level which
is generated when you get in contact with

06:39.860 --> 06:46.860
a living force. Now let us see what is that
living force. The living force is that which

06:47.370 --> 06:54.370
sprouts the seed. The Mother earth sprouts
the seed. If you see the Mother Earth as it

06:54.940 --> 07:01.430
is, you don’t find anything in it, nothing.
There’s just clay. But you put some seed

07:01.430 --> 07:07.140
and that wasteful thing that you think of
no use, this mud, that gives that life to

07:07.140 --> 07:13.150
the seed, and you find that the flowers become
fruits, automatically. It’s a wondrous world,

07:13.150 --> 07:20.150
if you start looking at the living work of
the living force, because we are not in connection

07:24.140 --> 07:31.140
with that, whatever we do, we go into problems,
but the nature does not, while we do.

07:36.550 --> 07:41.160
The reason is we have lost our biological
sustainers, or process. We are not biologically

07:41.160 --> 07:48.160
acting: it’s all dead action. What we do
is all dead. For example, as I told you before

07:50.860 --> 07:57.860
also that something is dead, a tree is dead
and you make a chair, then you think, ‘I

08:04.810 --> 08:11.810
have made this thing’. From dead to dead
to dead to dead, and this dead sits on our

08:13.010 --> 08:19.990
head. You make a chair, you cannot sit on
the ground. Then we start another thing like

08:19.990 --> 08:25.640
anti-culture business. That also just the
same. Like pendulum we may move. Now, we don’t

08:25.640 --> 08:30.200
like democracy, to have communism. From communism
to democracy, democracy to communism, there’s

08:30.200 --> 08:33.930
no movement!
Now what is the biological movement, within

08:33.930 --> 08:40.930
us? As you know there are peptiles in our
body, and the biological movement of peptiles

08:44.519 --> 08:51.519
is shown when the movement is spiral. When
it is spiral then it’s biological, and when

08:52.269 --> 08:57.410
it is linear then it is said that they have
lost their biological sustainers. They have

08:57.410 --> 09:02.189
no biological quality in them. They have become
linear. So that sustainers within us, that

09:02.189 --> 09:06.910
spiral movement within us, is existing in
our nerves, but can become absolutely linear,

09:06.910 --> 09:13.910
leading to death. All of our mental projections
are linear, because we cannot with that in

09:15.819 --> 09:22.819
our own awareness, in our own awareness, jump
higher. It is so outside. For a man might

09:25.430 --> 09:32.430
say, think: ‘Ah, I must try to improve the
whole world, I must do this thing’.

09:34.470 --> 09:41.470
There was a gentleman I met who is in charge
of the peace of the world, and the most disturbed

09:46.180 --> 09:53.180
personality I have ever come across, you see.
He was jumping this way, he was jumping this

10:24.420 --> 10:31.420
way, every sort of disturbance was in his
mind, and he’s supposed to be in charge

10:50.059 --> 10:54.399
of the peace of the world; imagine. Now what’s
the matter with the gentleman? Though he thinks

10:54.399 --> 11:01.399
of peace, he thinks of such big things, he
talks of higher ideals, everything. What is

11:01.999 --> 11:08.999
it inside? There is nothing, no peace. He’s
just talking outside. What is the reason?

11:09.129 --> 11:16.129
The reason is it’s only linear. He has accepted
that he is in charge of the peace, he must

11:17.040 --> 11:23.019
talk of big things, he must talk of ideal
things, and then the whole thing drops out.

11:23.019 --> 11:30.019
We had League of Nations, now we have United
Nations: all flops. So to make it spirally

11:30.660 --> 11:37.660
activated, what have we to do?
First of all we have to come to the right

11:39.720 --> 11:46.720
conclusion, understanding, that whatever we
have done so far has been linear in its action.

11:48.279 --> 11:55.279
It’s not biological. We cannot transform
a flower into a fruit. No living action we

11:56.050 --> 12:03.050
can take. We cannot perform any living action.
Once we understand that, then we have to know

12:07.119 --> 12:13.350
that we have to become more to be in connection
with that living force, that all-pervading

12:13.350 --> 12:20.350
force. And to get to that all-pervading force,
what have we to do? Actually what did we do

12:20.379 --> 12:23.529
to become human beings? Nothing. We just became,
spontaneously, Sahaja. Sahaj: spontaneously.

12:23.529 --> 12:30.529
It was just some force within us which worked
it out, that made us human beings. We didn’t

12:31.579 --> 12:36.629
do anything.
So one has to understand that if it is a living

12:36.629 --> 12:43.629
process, then you don’t have to do anything
about it. It is effortless. This is very difficult

12:43.899 --> 12:49.430
for human beings to understand. It is very
difficult, because they live with their ego,

12:49.430 --> 12:52.189
and they cannot accept that you cannot do
it yourself. They think, ‘We can do it ourselves’,

12:52.189 --> 12:59.189
which is not possible. You have to go to the
Mother Earth to ask the seed to be sprouted.

13:03.529 --> 13:10.529
You cannot sprout it. You may try to dissect
it, analyze it, put it under microscope, but

13:12.600 --> 13:19.600
you cannot sprout it. For sprouting, you have
to surrender yourself to that Mother Earth

13:21.019 --> 13:27.009
who does the job. To begin with, we have to
understand that we are not capable of doing

13:27.009 --> 13:34.009
any living work whatsoever. Once we have that
humility within us, then we start seeing what

13:35.550 --> 13:42.550
can happen to us by which we can become the
masters of that living force.

13:45.550 --> 13:52.550
To become something you have not done anything,
and to become higher you don’t have to do

13:52.749 --> 13:58.759
anything. That means there is built in within
you the complete mechanism which is going

13:58.759 --> 14:05.759
to work it out. Now before you I would say
it’s like a hypothesis for you and you have

14:06.769 --> 14:12.179
to understand it as a scientist would understand;
with an open mind, because this is the science

14:12.179 --> 14:19.179
of the Divine. It’s not known so far. This
is the knowledge of the roots, not known to

14:20.779 --> 14:27.779
anyone so far, I can say, but to known to
some people who have evolved themselves. They

14:34.050 --> 14:41.050
have gone above that state that is just mental,
and these are the very few people who know

14:42.249 --> 14:49.249
what it is. This knowledge is not of today;
is of thousands of years, but, is not the

14:49.519 --> 14:56.519
knowledge of the tree, as I told you, which
we have, but is the knowledge of the roots,

14:58.230 --> 15:02.970
which we have to understand.
The knowledge of the roots is that within

15:02.970 --> 15:07.809
you is placed the root, is called (Shri Mataji
speaks aside to the yogis present: ‘Is it

15:07.809 --> 15:13.790
here? No, ah. Somebody can come up, please.’)
Here, in the triangular bone is placed the

15:13.790 --> 15:20.790
thing called Kundalini. It is a Sanskrit word.
One should not be so frightened of Sanskrit.

15:21.569 --> 15:28.399
I was surprised, when I went to America, the
first question they asked me: ‘Why should

15:28.399 --> 15:33.489
you come and teach us about these things which
were in your country?’ I said: ‘To Me,

15:33.489 --> 15:40.489
it is just the same whether it is America
or India. Why did you come to India to teach

15:48.379 --> 15:53.239
us about science?’ Why this kind of an attitude
people have? Wherever there is knowledge,

15:53.239 --> 16:00.239
a humble person must go and (see it/seek it?)
This was discovered about 14 000 years back,

17:05.689 --> 17:12.689
where, in England, I don’t think people
lived here, in this country.

17:38.779 --> 17:45.779
So why should anybody feel humiliated? When
you think you are English, or you are American,

17:56.909 --> 18:03.909
you are wrong. You are a human being. God
never made a world like that. We are all one,

18:16.140 --> 18:23.140
and everybody has to support each other. Like
a flower thinks, I am a flower, a leaf thinks,

18:30.330 --> 18:37.330
I am a leaf, and the roots think they are
roots, then how the whole tree is going to

18:52.769 --> 18:59.769
manifest, just think? We are one, there’s
nothing that you are the tree, and you are

19:10.460 --> 19:17.460
the leaf, and you are the flower, and we are
everything. So to think like that if that

19:22.559 --> 19:29.559
is another mental projection we have, that
‘I am this’ and ‘I am that’. You are

19:34.960 --> 19:41.960
just a human being, which has been created
by God’s grace, to this level, as the most

19:49.000 --> 19:56.000
beautiful thing, the epitome, of His creation.
I would say that, in the west, there are more

20:04.389 --> 20:11.389
seekers, perhaps, than we have in the east,
perhaps, but that doesn’t mean that it is

20:13.610 --> 20:20.610
only because it is England, or America, but
it is only that all over the world God has

20:21.399 --> 20:28.399
this blessing and the message for everyone.
So first of all we must understand that this

20:28.510 --> 20:35.510
is the knowledge of the roots, and this knowledge
of the roots, unless and until we know about

20:40.490 --> 20:47.490
it, we have no right to criticize it. Moreover,
by criticizing you are not the gainer, you

20:49.590 --> 20:56.590
are the loser. So with complete openness of
a student we have to see to this, that this

20:58.870 --> 21:05.870
great force is placed within us, in a triangular
bone, whether you are an Australian, American,

21:07.429 --> 21:14.429
English, Indian, or coming from Timbuctoo.
All of you, if you are human beings, God has

21:15.760 --> 21:22.570
placed this force within you. He doesn’t
understand these differences, actually. It’s

21:22.570 --> 21:29.570
only we do understand. For Him it’s the
one world, that beautiful world He has created,

21:32.690 --> 21:39.690
and all the human beings are His children.
So in this triangular bone, is placed this

21:41.510 --> 21:48.070
beautiful thing called the Kundalini, and
this Kundalini is the motherhood within you.

21:48.070 --> 21:55.070
It’s a quality. It has nothing to do with
a woman or a man. It’s a quality, is a type,

22:02.559 --> 22:09.220
a personality. For example, I would say today,
Mohatma Ghandi, people accept him as a great

22:09.220 --> 22:16.220
man, because he had the quality of compassion.
He had the quality of giving, of nourishing.

22:17.039 --> 22:24.039
In the same way all the saints of the world
had this quality. They were motherly, full

22:26.570 --> 22:33.570
of compassion, love. Christ had the same.
He was so full of compassion that you cannot

22:35.529 --> 22:41.419
call him, in the worldly way, a man, because
man means he must hate, he must aggress, he

22:41.419 --> 22:48.419
must do all kinds of things to show his ego.
No. He was a personality who had compassion,

22:50.789 --> 22:55.880
who had nourishment.
Now to become that personality, what have

22:55.880 --> 23:02.880
we to do? Again, say I, nothing, because it
is all placed within you. The expression of

23:06.799 --> 23:13.799
Kundalini within you is the expression of
that great personality. When that happens

23:14.679 --> 23:21.679
to you, you yourself become like the Mother
Earth, that you can give, you can project

23:31.130 --> 23:38.130
yourself, that you become compassion yourself
and your compassion acts. These days, Kali

23:38.539 --> 23:45.539
Yuga is the modern times, what was the Kali
Yuga, the days of confusion, is over, and

23:52.899 --> 23:59.899
is called as Krita Yuga, means where this
living force will act, and this living force

24:04.779 --> 24:11.779
has to act through you. You become the medium
of that living force. Actually you become

24:15.380 --> 24:22.380
the master of that. But the beauty of this
is that it manifests within you also.

24:23.710 --> 24:30.600
For example, the electricity is flowing through
this; it doesn’t do anything to this instrument.

24:30.600 --> 24:37.600
But when this force starts flowing through
you, you get completely transformed into a

24:39.000 --> 24:42.659
new personality, and a personality that Christ
had described that you are to be born again.

24:42.659 --> 24:45.090
Again, linear way, is that artificially people
can brand themselves ‘born again’. But

24:45.090 --> 24:50.389
when it happens to you are completely transformed
from within, and the transformation is so

24:50.389 --> 24:57.389
visible, and so active, as Krita Yuga has
started, that you are amazed. You cannot believe,

25:02.220 --> 25:09.220
it is fantastic, because you are fantastically
made, extremely fantastically made, and that

25:09.710 --> 25:15.789
all things starts expressing itself as soon
as it manifests. So a human being should know

25:15.789 --> 25:22.789
that he’s made with great care, great love,
and for a very great thing: is to enjoy the

25:24.539 --> 25:31.539
love of his Father.
When this Kundalini rises within you, passes

25:32.820 --> 25:39.820
through six chakras - the seventh it does
not cross; the seventh is the guard – then

25:44.130 --> 25:51.130
it creates that spiral movement within our
awareness. The awareness itself gets spirally

25:52.320 --> 25:59.320
formed, and instead of moving in a pendulum
you move in such a way that you jump higher.

26:06.289 --> 26:13.289
Your awareness becomes higher than what it
used to be. So the human awareness becomes

26:15.559 --> 26:20.279
higher. There are lots of misunderstandings
about this, and it comes from the ignorance,

26:20.279 --> 26:26.269
because when you start seeking something from
ignorance, what happens that whatever you

26:26.269 --> 26:33.269
find, is a partial truth or could be something
not the truth. For example, in the darkness,

26:33.360 --> 26:40.360
you might see this and think it’s a snake.
A wire might look like a snake to you. But

26:46.320 --> 26:53.259
supposing you suddenly become enlightened.
Of course, in the beginning, light may not

26:53.259 --> 26:58.070
be that strong. In some people it could be
little bit, just a flicker. But you start

26:58.070 --> 27:05.070
seeing then, and gradually, if the light improves,
and the lantern improves, I can say, then

27:16.659 --> 27:21.799
you start seeing it, very clearly, what has
gone wrong with you, and you start correcting

27:21.799 --> 27:28.799
it.
Now the new awareness that comes into you

27:35.000 --> 27:42.000
is not something that can be just certified
that, ‘Alright, now you are realized souls.

27:49.090 --> 27:56.090
Have a brand and go ahead.’ It is not that
way. But you become conscious of that awareness,

28:02.590 --> 28:09.590
because for the first time, when the Kundalini
pierces through this fontanelle bone area,

28:12.769 --> 28:19.769
then you feel the cool breeze of the Holy
Ghost coming in. In the Sanskrit language,

28:20.960 --> 28:27.960
Holy Ghost is called as Adi Shakti. Most surprising
is that, I don’t know why, but in the Bible,

28:31.019 --> 28:38.019
Holy Ghost was not discussed much. Adi Shakti
is the Holy Ghost, and about Adi Shakti if

28:44.250 --> 28:51.250
you have
to learn, you have to go to Indian Scriptures.
Even in the Old Testament they say Jews know

29:03.960 --> 29:10.960
about it.
Now this power, which is the All-Pervading

29:12.360 --> 29:19.360
power of God, the power of His Love, becomes
evident, because you start feeling it on your

29:22.720 --> 29:29.720
fingers. And as you say in the English language,
you know, on your fingertips. Your hands start

29:37.039 --> 29:44.039
speaking. You can feel another personality,
you can put the hand towards another person,

29:44.649 --> 29:51.649
and you can see what are the centers catching,
because they are shown on this five, six and

29:54.539 --> 30:00.490
seven on the right, five, six and seven on
the left. This is the emotional side, and

30:00.490 --> 30:06.789
the right is the physical and the mental side.
Now the doctors cannot deal with the psychosomatic,

30:06.789 --> 30:11.799
or psychological things, and it’s a very
big problem because there is only analysis

30:11.799 --> 30:18.799
for you. Now, for a doctor it is important
to know both the sides of human beings, or

30:21.200 --> 30:27.629
I would say the three sides: the physical,
the mental and the emotional. But it is not

30:27.629 --> 30:34.629
so – he just knows part of it, while a psychologist
knows a part of it, and that’s how we cannot

30:39.120 --> 30:46.120
find out the reason for the problems that
exist within us. But when this Kundalini rises,

30:50.149 --> 30:57.149
She passes through these six centers which
are the milestones of our evolution, and thus

31:00.529 --> 31:07.529
integrates you completely. So the first thing
you receive is the integration. By that integration

31:08.970 --> 31:15.970
you are amazed that physically you get cured.
There has been a criticism about us in the

31:19.009 --> 31:26.009
newspaper, that we have started curing people.
Thank God we are not in America; there we

31:29.649 --> 31:36.649
would have been arrested, because the doctors
there do not allow anybody to cure anyone.

31:37.080 --> 31:40.799
But we do not cure. Automatically it happens:
when the Kundalini will rise, automatically

31:40.799 --> 31:47.799
it will happen that your whole being itself
will become integrated by which you will be

31:51.379 --> 31:55.840
healed. You will heal yourself, nobody else
is going to heal you. I don’t (know?) under

31:55.840 --> 31:58.999
law if you can charge a person if he heals
himself, but this will exactly happen that

31:58.999 --> 32:02.870
you will heal yourself, and you will know
how to heal yourself. But this is nothing.

32:02.870 --> 32:09.539
Is not only the physical side of it that happens
to you. Is just the minimum of minimums. But

32:09.539 --> 32:15.129
those people who (are?) suffering from mental
trouble also get healed.

32:15.129 --> 32:21.860
The third side of it is that physically you
are alright, mentally you are alright, and

32:21.860 --> 32:27.720
emotionally also, you are alright. Now there’s
a very big confusion about mental and emotional

32:27.720 --> 32:34.720
in English language. So if you have to say
‘mental’ as the brain is concerned, then

32:41.440 --> 32:48.440
they mean to say that person who is mad is
a mental case. Actually he’s a heart case,

32:52.899 --> 32:59.610
because he’s working with his heart. He
weeps, cries, but his head goes off, it’s

32:59.610 --> 33:06.610
a balance. When he’s working with his head
too much, his heart goes off. That’s another

33:11.799 --> 33:18.799
balance of the nature. So if you have even
the problem if you think too much, some people

33:22.620 --> 33:29.620
are so mad that they go on thinking like mad,
they cannot stop their thinking, they think,

33:34.279 --> 33:39.519
think, think, think, and they’re thinking
madness there, but they cannot stop it. So

33:39.519 --> 33:45.749
here, when the Kundalini rises, onto this
point, you become thoughtlessly aware. You

33:45.749 --> 33:52.749
don’t have to think; you can stop your thoughts.
If you want to think you can think, if you

33:56.240 --> 34:03.240
want to stop, you can stop. It is not necessary
for you to think, and that’s exactly what

34:06.769 --> 34:13.290
happens when the Kundalini rises here, that
mentally you become absolutely comfortable.

34:13.290 --> 34:19.809
Now this business of raising the Kundalini
is a business of God, and which cannot be

34:19.809 --> 34:26.740
sold. You cannot have a business on the human
level. You cannot sell it. You just cannot

34:26.740 --> 34:31.849
do it. How it happens is automatically. By
the grace of God it works out. You cannot

34:31.849 --> 34:38.849
sell anything that is the grace of God. What
is the value of that? On this point only many

34:42.720 --> 34:49.720
people discard Sahaja Yoga because they think
that it cannot be sold so it must be useless.

34:52.359 --> 34:58.770
It is so invaluable that you cannot pay for
it.

34:58.770 --> 35:05.770
Now the rising of the Kundalini has to take
place, first of all. (Could possibly be missing

35:14.329 --> 35:21.329
some lines here on the recording..) …the
Spirit. The Spirit is the one who is the master

35:21.869 --> 35:28.839
in you. So you become your own master, you
become your own guru. Nobody has to tell you

35:28.839 --> 35:35.839
‘do this’ or ‘do that’; you are guided,
because as soon as the Kundalini rises, you

35:39.880 --> 35:46.880
start feeling the cool breeze in your hands.
And these are giving you a new vibrations,

35:48.380 --> 35:53.829
a new dimension by which you know whether
to do this or not.

35:53.829 --> 35:57.309
For example, you want to do something; you
want to buy a book. You don’t have to decide

35:57.309 --> 36:04.309
about it: as soon as you go near the book
either it will give you cool breeze, or it

36:05.510 --> 36:12.510
may make you hot, or it may little bit burn
also if it’s a horrid one, and you don’t

36:12.800 --> 36:18.510
want to have that at any cost, you want to
have the cool breeze because you enjoy it.

36:18.510 --> 36:22.290
So you just give up. You just give up things
without anybody telling you, because your

36:22.290 --> 36:25.559
vibrations tell you. The spirit that has now
shine in your attention, tells you, and you

36:25.559 --> 36:32.559
start understanding, that now I have become
my own guru, because your guru is sitting

36:34.349 --> 36:39.900
inside you as the Spirit. It has not yet manifested
in your attention and that’s why you’re

36:39.900 --> 36:46.900
worried. But just it manifests, and once it
manifests you are amazed, that you yourself

36:46.900 --> 36:53.900
may have become a guru of yourself. You don’t
need anybody else to tell you, but you can

36:59.300 --> 37:06.300
do it yourself. You can find out yourself.
Nobody has to give any explanation, or correction,

37:09.339 --> 37:16.339
or anything, you just start improving yourself.
Automatically it works, and little bit, if

37:18.160 --> 37:25.160
you know, how to decode it, and how to work
it out, your problems, you just manage it.

37:29.730 --> 37:36.540
You become yourself a guru. That’s the thing
you have to be.

37:36.540 --> 37:42.089
Of course I told you, you cannot pay for it.
It’s an insult even to think that you can

37:42.089 --> 37:49.089
pay for it. Nobody can understand this; that
this is complete benevolence, is complete.

37:51.089 --> 37:55.270
It’s not mercenary act of benevolence, but
it is a complete, absolute benevolence, and

37:55.270 --> 38:00.240
for this benevolence you cannot pay. As soon
as you pay for it, it is no more of benevolence.

38:00.240 --> 38:07.240
And that’s why you cannot pay for it. You
cannot work it out, it has to just work out.

38:10.710 --> 38:17.710
Now, especially in the west, there is a problem
with people that they think, ‘Why should

38:20.609 --> 38:27.609
Mother do it?’. I tell you, it’s a thankless
job. You cannot do it. If you can do it, I’ll

38:29.480 --> 38:36.480
be happy to retire. But you cannot do it.
That’s the point (INAUDIBLE). This is my

38:38.790 --> 38:45.790
job, what am I to do? Supposing I am that,
what am I to do now? If I have to do it, if

38:48.339 --> 38:55.339
I am supposed to do it, then what should I
do? I mean supposing you are posted as something;

38:57.480 --> 39:04.480
you are a policeman, you have to do the policeman’s
job. Now, how can you challenge it? He has

39:08.880 --> 39:15.880
to do it. As if you can say, I’m paid for
it, or you can say that this is my job. This

39:19.849 --> 39:26.849
I have to do, though I know it is very, very
troublesome. To get it done is not easy, it’s

39:28.940 --> 39:35.940
not very easy. Everyone may not get realization,
I cannot guarantee that. I cannot say that

39:48.300 --> 39:55.300
you all will get the realization, it’s a
very difficult thing. Some people will just

39:55.470 --> 40:02.470
miss it for some time. There’s nothing to
be worried about it; it has to be corrected.

40:04.450 --> 40:11.450
It has to be redeemed, as they say. The Kundalini
has to be brought up, if there are centers

40:14.220 --> 40:18.619
catching they have to be cleared out, they
have to be brought up, and we have to have

40:18.619 --> 40:24.920
complete understanding and compassion about
ourselves, and love for ourself and respect

40:24.920 --> 40:31.920
for ourself. That if you have to become the
light, then we have to adjust and cooperate.

40:35.460 --> 40:42.460
Now the thing is that the ego part of it is
the strongest enemy of realization. I. I like

40:44.750 --> 40:51.750
it. I am this, I am that. When you say of
‘I, it is not yourself, your spirit, but

40:52.630 --> 40:59.630
it is your ego that’s saying ‘I’. When
you become the spirit you don’t say ‘I’,

41:03.530 --> 41:10.530
but you say ‘it’. You talk in the third
person. You say, ‘It is not coming up, it

41:16.069 --> 41:23.069
is not working out, it is not’, in a third
way. You never say, ‘I will raise the Kundalini’.

41:24.510 --> 41:30.630
What you will say: ‘the Kundalini is not
coming up. The Kundalini is not there.’

41:30.630 --> 41:37.630
In a third person you start talking, so that
you do not take any credit or discredit for

41:39.460 --> 41:46.460
it.
Now, it is for you to observe it and see for

41:51.280 --> 41:58.280
yourself. It depends on your power of observation.
Whatever doctors may tell you, or anything,

42:00.690 --> 42:07.690
you don’t have to believe those, because
it depends on your own observation and sense

42:09.190 --> 42:16.190
of penetration.
Like I would say, I went to the Union Society

42:17.339 --> 42:24.339
and the Chairman of the Union Society was
82-year-old man. And he got his realization.

42:29.339 --> 42:36.339
And I told about Jung’s mistake why he missed
the point, which they understood very well.

42:38.690 --> 42:45.690
But then he got up, very humbly, and he says,
‘Mother, now you have learned our language,

42:46.049 --> 42:53.049
let us talk your language, let us learn your
language’. And then at the second meeting

42:53.799 --> 43:00.799
he says, ‘Now I have observed - it’s not
a question, but my observation, if it is true

43:02.010 --> 43:09.010
- that you don’t believe in time. There’s
no time.’ Just you give it like that. That

43:09.849 --> 43:16.849
depends on your own observation. But I would
not like to accept any ideas about Me because

43:18.410 --> 43:25.170
I know it is terrible; sometimes it can act
against. I mean, some people may just leave,

43:25.170 --> 43:31.500
you know, they can’t bear it anymore. So
that’s not the point. You have to see for

43:31.500 --> 43:38.049
yourself, observe yourself. There’s nothing
to gain from you, at all for Me, you cannot

43:38.049 --> 43:45.049
give Me anything, whatever you may try. There’s
nothing to ask for. It is you who have to

43:49.119 --> 43:56.119
take something from Me which you better have
it. I’m like a cashier on the bank, see?

44:09.890 --> 44:16.890
You have got your cheques. Now, I have nothing
to get from you. The cashier is paid for,

44:20.579 --> 44:27.069
alright, that’s one point, is different,
from the employer, but not by you. And what

44:27.069 --> 44:34.069
I have to do is to take your cheques and cash
it. Now, when you are in that position, will

44:34.940 --> 44:41.940
you be angry with me for that? Will you say
to your cashier, ‘Why are you doing this

44:46.329 --> 44:53.329
to me? Why should I take money from you?’
If that is intelligible, then we can see there

44:53.780 --> 45:00.780
is some meeting point between us, and we can
talk of realization then in a way that it

45:01.660 --> 45:08.660
has to be done. You all have to have your
key, your spirit, that is within you. Perhaps

45:12.220 --> 45:15.690
I know that better than you. You know many
things better than Me. I don’t know even

45:15.690 --> 45:21.079
how to use a plastic bag, but I know how to
open the Kundalini. I am so hopelessly bad

45:21.079 --> 45:28.079
at so many things which are so trivial and
simple which you can do just like that, I

45:29.299 --> 45:36.299
cannot do it. So it’s alright, so, I am
also quite humble about it, I don’t mind.

45:38.079 --> 45:44.109
I don’t know many things, but I know one
thing, is that you are the Spirit, and you

45:44.109 --> 45:51.109
have to become the Spirit, through the awakening
of your Kundalini. This is what a Mother can

45:52.930 --> 45:59.930
do, is to explain to you, that come to the
right conclusion, that you have to have it,

46:05.500 --> 46:12.500
it is within you, and you have to get it.
But I cannot force it on you. I cannot make

46:13.849 --> 46:18.299
you take it. Or else if you do not want to
have it I just can’t do it. It’s impossible.

46:18.299 --> 46:25.299
There’s no (hypnosis?) in it. It’s a happening
that has to take place with complete understanding

46:25.349 --> 46:31.380
of your freedom.
I hope you will understand this new method,

46:31.380 --> 46:38.280
that if you have to go to the roots, you have
to become subtler than what you are, and to

46:38.280 --> 46:45.280
become that subtler being, you have to become
the Spirit, your Kundalini has to be awakened.

46:47.299 --> 46:54.299
Now, if you have any questions, you can ask
me, and there’s no need to be aggressive

46:59.170 --> 47:06.170
with me, because I have not come here to take
anything from you. But if you have any questions

47:07.309 --> 47:14.309
you can ask me. One thing I must tell you:
if you are going to some other guru, or something,

47:18.680 --> 47:25.680
because I have seen also these people are
going to other gurus and I think these gurus

47:26.539 --> 47:32.589
feel threatened because I don’t take any
money and they feel threatened about it, whatever

47:32.589 --> 47:38.180
it is. If you are (registered/adjusted?) with
any guru or still attached to someone, you

47:38.180 --> 47:45.180
may go away, because I am not here to quarrel
with you for that. You can go away; it’s

47:46.480 --> 47:53.480
all your free choice. But if you want to become
the Spirit, if you want to have your realization,

47:54.500 --> 48:01.299
you’re welcome; I’ll be very happy to
work it out. Now, let me have some questions

48:01.299 --> 48:04.950
if you have. Yes?
(Inaudible question from audience. Yogi: What

48:04.950 --> 48:11.950
happens to your self-realization when the
body dies? What happens to your Kundalini

48:13.430 --> 48:17.549
and Spirit?)
That is again futuristic. You be in the present,

48:17.549 --> 48:24.549
my child, alright? Now this is a very futuristic
question. Now you’re not going to die, I

48:25.960 --> 48:32.960
can assure you, for some time. So we’ll
do it later on. Because why should you worry

48:33.799 --> 48:40.799
about your death just now? I am talking of
eternal life. Let’s (take?) it, be in the

48:41.390 --> 48:47.369
present, alright? It’s a good question,
but why should you worry about death? (Inaudible

48:47.369 --> 48:53.770
discussion in the audience. Yogi: Just, Mother’s
given you the answer. Just leave it.) I have

48:53.770 --> 49:00.770
given you the answer. This is not the time
to talk about it, it requires a complete lecture,

49:07.809 --> 49:14.809
alright? I’ll tell you later on. I’ll
write to you. You give me your address, I’ll

49:20.789 --> 49:27.130
write to you. (Further inaudible discussion
in the audience. Yogi: Next question, please.)

49:27.130 --> 49:33.349
Now don’t take others’ time, because I’m
not interested, now. Don’t be interested

49:33.349 --> 49:40.349
what happens to your death, and what happens.
That is not to be seen just now. Just now

49:43.849 --> 49:49.260
you get your realization; the first step.
That’s why Bhudda did not talk of God, even,

49:49.260 --> 49:55.809
because he thought, he talks of God then people
ask, ‘What is God? Where is He? Well, can

49:55.809 --> 50:02.349
I see Him? Can I meet Him?’. So he said,
alright. Just take your self-realization,

50:02.349 --> 50:07.930
finished. Nothing more than that. (Further
inaudible discussion in audience.) No, no,

50:07.930 --> 50:14.930
no, please sit down. You are from some other
group, I think. Do you belong to some other

50:15.150 --> 50:20.770
group? (Inaudible response from audience).
I know, I know that. No, please sit down.

50:20.770 --> 50:27.770
We don’t want you here. Please sit down.
Now this is not the way to behave. We don’t

50:27.920 --> 50:34.920
go to your group, why don’t you take your
own hall and give a lecture there? If you

50:36.480 --> 50:42.750
belong to another group you don’t come here.
These people have been always troubling us

50:42.750 --> 50:49.750
like this. This is too much. Why are you troubling
us? What have we done to you? Why do you come

50:50.970 --> 50:56.069
here and trouble us? (Inaudible response from
audience.) No, that’s not good, that’s

50:56.069 --> 51:03.069
not being kind, and civil. You better learn
these things, first of all. Please sit down.

51:06.559 --> 51:13.559
Please sit down. This is not the way to behave,
to go to somebody’s groups and, you see,

51:13.740 --> 51:20.740
I don’t go to these people, I don’t talk
about these people, why should you go to other

51:23.599 --> 51:30.599
peoples’? Go and learn from your guru and
become whatever you want to become, it’s

51:32.460 --> 51:39.460
alright. I’ve already told you, we shouldn’t
trouble somebody like this all the time. It’s

51:41.150 --> 51:48.089
not good. That’s why realization is needed;
then you’ll understand how to be gentle.

51:48.089 --> 51:52.460
They give big ideas; you become mokshas, you
become this, you have become this, and you,

51:52.460 --> 51:59.460
you go with those ideas. You don’t even
have vibrations to feel what you are; what

51:59.970 --> 52:06.970
your guru is. You don’t have any understanding,
no discretion; nothing. You go to a guru and

52:09.809 --> 52:16.809
he says, ‘Alright. Now you, you are going
to go beyond everything’. You believe it.

52:17.520 --> 52:24.520
This is all ego pampering. If you want to
live with it, go ahead. (Further inaudible

52:24.869 --> 52:31.869
discussion from audience.) You believe into
whatever you believe it in your own way, but

52:32.420 --> 52:38.170
whatever you believe has done no good to anyone.
Has it done any good to anyone? You may believe

52:38.170 --> 52:45.170
into anything, so what? It’s not important.
What have you done so far? What good have

52:45.410 --> 52:51.640
you done to anyone so far? (Further inaudible
discussion from audience.) What’s he saying?

52:51.640 --> 52:57.030
(Yogi: Let’s leave it, please.) No, don’t
do like that. (Yogi: Next question.) It’s

52:57.030 --> 53:01.520
not good. It’s not civil. No, no, no, no,
no, no. You better join some politics, you’ll

53:01.520 --> 53:08.520
be better there. (Audience laughter.) You
are not meant for spiritual life. You go into

53:08.680 --> 53:12.119
some politics; you’ll be better off. Now,
let us have some other questions.

53:12.119 --> 53:14.960
(Yogi: If there are no questions, those few
people who want…) These are stupid people

53:14.960 --> 53:20.000
wasting their time, I tell you, really, wasting
their time, wasting our time. Done no good

53:20.000 --> 53:22.430
to anyone…
(Inaudible question from audience. Yogi: If

53:22.430 --> 53:26.849
he gets self-realization, will it interfere
in any way with his normal functioning?)

53:26.849 --> 53:31.539
No, no, you will be very normal. (Shri Mataji
and audience laughter.) You become extremely

53:31.539 --> 53:37.569
normal. You become so normal that you are
amazed at yourself. You see, all abnormalities

53:37.569 --> 53:41.890
drop out, first of all. And secondly, you
become so dynamic, absolutely dynamic. We

53:41.890 --> 53:46.920
have people here who couldn’t do any jobs,
or they were depressed, this, that, but apart

53:46.920 --> 53:52.319
from that when they started doing jobs they
were surprised. The students who could not

53:52.319 --> 53:57.630
pass their exams took first in the class,
they had the highest marks. The people who

53:57.630 --> 54:03.849
could not concentrate become well-known artists,
well-known architects. We have so many Indian

54:03.849 --> 54:10.849
artists in India, especially, who are very
well-known artists but they had fallen prey

54:18.099 --> 54:25.099
to, say, alcohol, or something, they have
become great artists and now when they sing,

54:30.299 --> 54:37.299
you see, it’s so melodious, they themselves
now feel it that way. And on my birthday they

54:39.230 --> 54:45.109
came to sing, because they said, ‘Mother,
You have given us this new dimension in our

54:45.109 --> 54:50.970
music’. You become extremely creative, and
very dynamic, and you are not tired, because

54:50.970 --> 54:55.990
you get connected with the whole.
(Yogi: Yes. Inaudible question from audience.

54:55.990 --> 55:01.430
Shri Mataji chuckles as She listens.) Thank
you. (Further inaudible discussion from the

55:01.430 --> 55:08.430
same questioner, a doctor.) Yes, doctor, I’m
sorry to say it is so. It’s so many diseases

55:11.630 --> 55:18.319
can be cured, so many. I would not say all
I would cover, like supposing you have a cata,

55:18.319 --> 55:25.319
catarac, in the eye, and we cannot cure that,
we have seen that. And also, things where

55:25.920 --> 55:32.920
something is dead in the body, then you have
to remove it, you see, and things like that.

55:35.099 --> 55:42.099
But I think if it is
not in a very galloping state, if it is still
there and if you do not interfere too much

55:53.049 --> 56:00.049
with it, and do proper meditation the way
it is to be done, you see these are only permutations

56:01.480 --> 56:07.910
and combinations of these centers that we
get into trouble. If you are in the center,

56:07.910 --> 56:14.740
you see, if you are in the center, I mean,
no less than Guru Nanak, Himself, has talked

56:14.740 --> 56:20.930
about it, absolutely, and this is what work
He has done. I’m doing His work, only, only

56:20.930 --> 56:27.930
thing is that today is the time for, to give
you the proof of what he said. So if these

56:32.180 --> 56:39.180
centers are kept normal, and if the Kundalini
starts flowing properly, then what happens

56:41.500 --> 56:46.710
is that you get connected with that all-pervading
power which is the life force itself. It’s

56:46.710 --> 56:53.119
not only Prana. It’s not only the right-sided
thing which we call the Prana, the white thing

56:53.119 --> 57:00.119
is, but also the emotional, and also the evolutionary
process, the sustenance. So it gives all the

57:00.240 --> 57:07.240
three forces within us and if you know how
to manipulate it and manifest it, you can

57:09.920 --> 57:15.210
work it out. And for you, especially, I would
say, that it is your heritage, itself, so

57:15.210 --> 57:22.210
for you it should be a great thing to understand
it. But of course the patients who are absolutely

57:24.020 --> 57:31.020
gone cases, and some patients, I would say,
I must admit this, like Hitler, now, Hitler

57:31.420 --> 57:38.279
I wouldn’t be able to cure, I’m sorry,
because you must have some catch there also,

57:38.279 --> 57:44.329
isn’t it?, with God. If you ask Me to cure
Hitler or somebody like that, it’s going

57:44.329 --> 57:51.329
to be difficult. But, people are normally
good people, and those who are good people,

57:53.740 --> 58:00.740
who lead a righteous life, not an aggressive
life, and are of good nature, can be easily

58:06.630 --> 58:12.369
cured.
Once it happened that there was one doctor

58:12.369 --> 58:19.369
Daetey; he brought Me a lady to be cured of
her heart ailment, and she was very serious,

58:22.950 --> 58:29.950
and he thought he, she, she may not be alright
with Sahaja Yoga. But I cured her, but I told

58:31.960 --> 58:38.960
him that this lady would not survive, within
three days she is going to die. She was so

58:39.950 --> 58:45.569
much cured that he could not believe, because
every heartbeat was alright, everything was

58:45.569 --> 58:51.700
alright. He was surprised: I was saying that
she is going to die after three days. So he

58:51.700 --> 58:58.700
said, ‘How do you know, Mother?’. I said
‘I don’t know how do I know but I know

59:00.829 --> 59:07.829
she is going to die’. Then I told him, ‘Doctor,
you go and find out the history of this woman,

59:10.539 --> 59:17.539
what sort of a woman she is, so then you will
know what I am saying. And he found out that

59:18.309 --> 59:25.309
she’s the woman because of her, her daughter-in-law
committed suicide, and her husband had become

59:51.240 --> 59:58.240
really mad; an extremely aggressive woman
and she has tortured all
the people in the family. She had no love

01:00:24.569 --> 01:00:31.569
at all, and there was no need for her to be
blessed to that extent that she should get

01:00:36.589 --> 01:00:43.260
completely cured. Perhaps, I think her life
was cut short was good, and that’s how she

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:50.260
could not survive, after that, and she died
really after three days. And the doctor Daetey

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:56.440
was himself surprised. I told him himself,
that, ‘You will get a heart attack too,

01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:02.549
if you don’t take to Sahaja Yoga’, and
he died of heart, because his heart was catching,

01:01:02.549 --> 01:01:07.210
he wouldn’t believe, because he said, ‘It’s
showing alright, my x-ray’s alright’.

01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:11.680
I said, ‘It is not’.
It is such a subtle thing. Before the disease

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:18.680
starts, you see, you cannot make out, but
the disease starts at a point, when it is

01:01:28.329 --> 01:01:35.329
so subtle, that doctors also cannot make it
out. But in Sahaja Yoga you can. You catch

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:52.480
on this finger. If you catch on this finger,
that means there’s some pressure on your

01:02:10.650 --> 01:02:17.650
heart. And if you’re catching on this finger
it’s better to pay attention to your heart

01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:37.910
immediately, and
you carry the very simple thing, very simple,
the mantra for heart attack is: ‘Mother

01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:53.510
I am the Spirit’. Just (say/do) it. ‘Mother
I am the Spirit’. (Hindi translation), that’s

01:03:10.289 --> 01:03:17.289
all. If you say it three times you can get
rid of it. But, this mantra has to be siddh.

01:03:29.809 --> 01:03:36.809
Every Dick, Tom and Harry cannot give you
the mantra. Any person who is a realized soul

01:03:53.039 --> 01:04:00.039
can only give you that. That is one thing
very important. And Nanaka himself always

01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:32.950
talked about Satguru, you see, because he
found out that people used to talk about guru

01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:37.799
like Swami Ramdass and all those talk of guru.
But then he thought that it’s better to

01:04:37.799 --> 01:04:44.289
call Satguru and guru as two things. Satguru
is the one who has got realization, and the

01:04:44.289 --> 01:04:48.250
one who calls himself as guru without realization
talks big, ‘I, you, I’ll give you this

01:04:48.250 --> 01:04:53.660
and I’ll give you that’, and just makes
a big organization out of that, is not a guru.

01:04:53.660 --> 01:05:00.180
So that is what it is, a person has to be
a realized soul, and he must know all the

01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:03.779
details about how to do it.
Now, as if you are interested, I would like

01:05:03.779 --> 01:05:08.549
to meet some of you doctors here, and I tell
you all about it, details, and I can make

01:05:08.549 --> 01:05:13.670
you master in no time, there’s no problem.
But a Sahaja Yogi is a person who knows all

01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:18.789
about Kundalini, he knows how to deal with
it, how to work it out. Now he himself is

01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:22.990
a doctor, and he has cured many people with
Sahaja Yoga, and is a very simple thing, and

01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:27.289
which can work out. Thank God this country
is a free country in this respect, and that

01:05:27.289 --> 01:05:32.109
they have asked us to write to them about
this method of Sahaja Yoga; how we cure people.

01:05:32.109 --> 01:05:36.839
But that’s just the basics. That’s not
so important. What is important is to become

01:05:36.839 --> 01:05:41.250
the spirit.
(Inaudible question from same audience member.)

01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:48.250
Yes, by all means. Why not? I would love to
have you for tea at my residence. You give

01:05:49.119 --> 01:05:53.349
your name and address and I’ll, I’ll let
you know. I thank you very much. Thank you

01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:58.650
very much doctor. Yes.
(Yogi: Any more? Yes.) (Inaudible question

01:05:58.650 --> 01:06:05.650
from audience member.) What did he say? (Yogi:
Sorry, could you say again? Ah. And you’re

01:06:07.109 --> 01:06:10.829
asking will it help.) Yes. (Yogi: His son
has been very depressed.) Where do you live,

01:06:10.829 --> 01:06:13.390
in what part? (Inaudible response from audience
member.) Alright. It’s not difficult; we

01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:20.390
have a center here. (Inaudible discussion
from the man. Yogi: So, medication doesn’t

01:06:25.769 --> 01:06:32.769
help, is that what you’re saying?…) (Inaudible
response.) (Yogi: Ah. No medication is required

01:06:34.119 --> 01:06:38.859
at the moment but they as parents are very
worried about him.) No, I know, depression

01:06:38.859 --> 01:06:44.119
is also to be understood in its full, full
extent. How people get depressed, you see?

01:06:44.119 --> 01:06:51.119
And how people get into problems on depression.
It’s very simple and it can be cured. He

01:06:51.559 --> 01:06:55.880
can be cured. We have people here who were
very depressed and now today they have become

01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:59.029
dynamic people, so it’s alright. You can,
you can go to the center, you take the address

01:06:59.029 --> 01:07:04.220
of the center, and you, you take the photograph,
and they, we’ll manage. You just don’t

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:07.109
worry, they’ll tell you how to do it, but
do it religiously. The way they are telling

01:07:07.109 --> 01:07:11.549
you if you do it. It’s very simple methods,
they will tell you; you have to have faith

01:07:11.549 --> 01:07:17.630
in yourself and you have to do it religiously,
it will work out. I promise it can be worked

01:07:17.630 --> 01:07:20.450
out. Now, behind you is sitting there some
Mohan, is sitting, just see that boy, sitting

01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:25.309
behind you, and he had been to some guru like
that, who just ruined his awareness completely.

01:07:25.309 --> 01:07:28.010
He was really, absolutely, out of mind. And
now you won’t believe, he writes poetry

01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:28.799
so beautifully, like, when I read it I think
of Kabir, like that. He’s writing poetry

01:07:28.799 --> 01:07:30.170
now. So it’s something so different, you
know? So, it can happen. You just bring the,

01:07:30.170 --> 01:07:34.510
you take the address and bring the photograph
of the boy, with his birth date and all that

01:07:34.510 --> 01:07:39.640
and give it to them, we’ll work it out.
(Inaudible comment from man.) He’s an artist?

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:42.849
Then it’s alright. He’ll become a greater
artist. (Laugher from audience.)

01:07:42.849 --> 01:07:46.519
(Yogi: Yes? Audience member: Asking about
special diet, the difficulty of meditation)

01:07:46.519 --> 01:07:53.519
It was not hard at all! (Shri Mataji laughs.)
(Audience member: Laughs. It wasn’t hard!

01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:24.400
…INAUDIBLE…) No, no, no. You see, it is
Sahaja Samadhi. It is Sahaja. Sahaja has another

01:08:43.290 --> 01:08:50.290
meaning also; easy. That’s the quality of
your mother, I should say, has to be (easier/easiest?).

01:08:51.509 --> 01:08:56.389
Mother gives you birth, does she give you
any trouble? Nothing. She takes all the trouble,

01:08:56.389 --> 01:09:00.120
so you don’t have to worry. Kundalini takes
all the trouble within you, you don’t have

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:05.920
to do anything. So it’s very Sahaj, is absolutely
Sahaj. It is absolutely spontaneous. It doesn’t

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:12.920
give you trouble at all. It is absolutely
easy, easy as possible. Has to be, because

01:09:14.469 --> 01:09:18.339
it is so vital. Whatever is not vital is like
this, that guru says, ‘Don’t eat this,

01:09:18.339 --> 01:09:22.810
don’t do that, stand on your heads, do this,
do that’. That’s not the mother’s style.

01:09:22.810 --> 01:09:29.810
But the real gurus, also, they’re very strict,
no doubt, but the real gurus give you realization.

01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:36.339
That’s the first thing they do. They don’t
tell you that, ‘I’ll take you to mokshas,

01:09:36.339 --> 01:09:40.750
I’ll do this’, nothing of these big talks.
They say that, ‘First of all you get your

01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:47.750
realization’.
Any other question, please. (Inaudible question

01:09:50.489 --> 01:09:57.489
from audience member and general laughter.
Yogi: Can you give some evidence of Your own

01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:09.980
enlightenment? Shri Mataji laughs, more audience
laughter.) What evidence you want? What evidence

01:10:12.190 --> 01:10:18.120
you understand? You see, the evidence is if
your Kundalini is awakened, then only you

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:22.340
will understand. What Christ could not give
evidence (so/to?) you crucified him nicely.

01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:25.199
But I am going to give you the evidence, you
the evidence. I will give you. You sit down,

01:10:25.199 --> 01:10:25.630
you get your realization, then you’ll get
the evidence, alright? Once you get your realization

01:10:25.630 --> 01:10:27.679
you’ll get the evidence, isn’t it? What
is the evidence that the candle is enlightened?

01:10:27.679 --> 01:10:28.250
That it when you take it near an unlit, unlit…supposing
this is an enlightened candle, the evidence

01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:29.010
is that it can enlighten another candle, isn’t
it? That is the evidence. Now you sit down,

01:10:29.010 --> 01:10:29.679
first you, let’s see if you get realization.
That’s the evidence, alright? If you don’t

01:10:29.679 --> 01:10:30.710
get the realization, then the evidence is
that something wrong with you, because many

01:10:30.710 --> 01:10:31.389
will get it. It’s you who has to give Me
the evidence, not Me, because I don’t have,

01:10:31.389 --> 01:10:31.780
you see, these questions are alright for a
person who’s taking money from you, or taking

01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:32.159
anything from you, or I’m telling you anything,
nothing, I’m just saying, you take it. These

01:10:32.159 --> 01:10:33.840
questions are just other way around, should
be, isn’t it? It is you who has to give

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:34.449
the evidence that you have got it, not Me.
Here at least there are 60% people who have

01:10:34.449 --> 01:10:35.409
got it. 60% people. So if you get it, thank
your stars that you’ve got it. If you don’t

01:10:35.409 --> 01:10:38.020
get it I’ll have to work hard with you.
(Yogi: Why don’t we all ask for it now.

01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:39.340
Just slip your shoes off, and put your hands
on your lap, put your hands out, and ask for

01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:40.659
it. Ask for it in your heart, that is.) I
think all of you should get seated down, first

01:10:40.659 --> 01:10:40.909
of all, properly. You see? There should be
no (INAUDIBLE). Please be seated. There are

01:10:40.810 --> 01:10:41.060
some seats here. Come along. There are some
seats here, also.

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:41.630
There’s one thing I have to tell you, that
it is something that happens within yourself,

01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:41.880
and it is a very quick thing; it’s the split
of a second, when the Kundalini rises, just

01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:42.110
split of a second. But, if there is any obstruction,
then it takes some time, and I have seen,

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:42.250
that say, in an Indian village, I have seen
6000 people just get realization in the split

01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:43.280
of a second, but, the more we get sophisticated
and modernized, we get complicated. So, we

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:44.370
have to, little bit, give some energy to our
different centers, and try to nourish it,

01:10:44.370 --> 01:10:48.449
so that the Kundalini is moving faster, without
any obstruction. To remove the obstruction,

01:10:48.449 --> 01:10:53.590
we have to work it out in a very simple way,
which I’ll tell you, that left hand you

01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:55.699
have to put like this, which is the power
of desire. So put the left hand like this.

01:10:55.699 --> 01:10:57.590
All these things I cannot explain in one,
one lecture, and it’s too much, also, like

01:10:57.590 --> 01:11:01.590
I would say that if you had to switch on then
you just pull the switch and the lights will

01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:02.460
be on. In the same way we can say put this
left hand straight like this, just like this,

01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:03.460
on your lap, very comfortably, and with the
right hand, I will say where to go.

01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:05.170
Now first of all, you must close your eyes,
and don’t open your eyes till I tell you.

01:11:05.170 --> 01:11:07.540
Take out your spectacles if possible, and…
it’s already going to deep I can’t keep

01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:11.989
my eyes open… now put the left hand towards
Me and with the right hand you have to move,

01:11:11.989 --> 01:11:13.790
so keep your eyes shut and also, if you can
take out your spectacles it’s better because

01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:18.520
you don’t have to see anything. Better,
it’s good for the eyesight. So better take

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:23.540
out your spectacles, and be comfortable. There
should be nothing tight anywhere in the body,

01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:26.030
anywhere.
Now, what you put your left hand towards Me,

01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:28.320
and with the right hand, right hand, you put
it on your heart on the left-hand side, to

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:31.120
begin with. It’s very important. Now, on
the heart, we are putting it, first of all,

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.310
because we have to say that ‘Mother, I am
the Spirit’. You can address Me as Shri

01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.699
Mataji, as Mother, whatever. If it is easier
for you to say Shri Mataji, is alright, otherwise

01:11:32.699 --> 01:11:32.949
to make it easier you can call Me Mother.
I am the Spirit. Everyone should try. Everyone

01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:33.150
should try. Or you can ask a question: ‘Am
I the Spirit?’.

01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:33.150
Now, slowly take this side down on the left-hand
side of your stomach, left-hand side of your

01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:33.150
stomach, and press it hard. Left-hand side
of your stomach. Don’t open your eyes. Put

01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:33.150
this right hand on the left-hand side of your
stomach, because there resides the principle

01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:33.150
of the Primordial master, of your mastery.
So here, you have to say, ten times, because

01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:33.150
you have ten valencies. As human beings we
have ten valencies, so we have to say ten

01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:33.150
times: ‘Mother, I am my own master. I am
my own guru’, to awaken within you the Primordial

01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:33.150
master. ‘I am my own guide.’ With full
confidence. Without any guilt, without any

01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:33.150
guilt. Without any guilt you have to say,
‘I’m my own master’. This is one of

01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:33.159
the diseases in the west; to feel guilty.
At the present moment, your past is not there.

01:11:33.159 --> 01:11:33.719
You just worry, don’t worry about your past.
You just say, ‘Mother, I am my own master’

01:11:33.719 --> 01:11:33.969
with full confidence. Don’t feel guilty.
(Long pause.) Please don’t feel guilty throughout.

01:11:33.810 --> 01:11:34.060
Please don’t feel guilty at all. And don’t
count your sins but count your blessings.

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:34.170
Now raise this right hand, again, back to
the heart, with complete love and understanding

01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:34.280
about yourself, and full respect, because
you are at the epitome of the evolution. You

01:11:34.190 --> 01:11:34.440
must respect yourself. At this point, you
have to say 12 times, ‘Mother I am the Spirit’,

01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:34.670
because at this chakras, there are twelve
sub-chakras, that’s why it is to be said

01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:34.880
12 times, or petals, sub-petals as they call
it. Mother, I am the Spirit. Just say that.

01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:35.110
You are the Spirit, believe Me, you are. Just
say that. (Long pause. Yogi tells Mother that

01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:35.340
he and/or the other yogis present feel left
vishuddi.) Now don’t feel guilty at that

01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:35.550
time. Don’t weep, or cry, don’t feel bad.
Just say, ‘Mother, I am not guilty, I am

01:11:35.530 --> 01:11:35.780
the Spirit’, with full confidence, you are.
Don’t feel guilty. This feeling guilty causes

01:11:35.719 --> 01:11:35.969
angina, one part of it, I tell you. Now, with
that fear at least you’ll stop feeling guilty.

01:11:35.969 --> 01:11:36.219
(Shri Mataji chuckles. She says to yogis),
Hmm, better.

01:11:36.090 --> 01:11:36.610
Now put that right hand on the base of your
neck on the left-hand side, from the front.

01:11:36.610 --> 01:11:36.980
From the front. On the base, on the left-hand
side. Base of your neck on the left-hand side,

01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:37.230
take your hand in front, not from the back.
Now press it hard, a little. Now this is the

01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:37.230
point, which catches very badly, when you
feel guilty. Now, just say, ‘Mother, I am

01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:37.230
not guilty’, 16 times. But I always say
that if you have too much of this fashion,

01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:37.300
of feeling guilty, then you may punish yourself
by saying 35 times, or 108 times. Just laugh

01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:37.550
at yourself for feeling guilty; that’s the
best way. Do not condemn yourself. Say it

01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:37.670
16 times. (Long pause.) Still you are feeling
guilty.

01:11:37.489 --> 01:11:37.850
Now, put this hand on your forehead across,
without feeling guilty again. Throughout I

01:11:37.850 --> 01:11:38.130
have to say this because that’s the main
thing you’re catching, all the time, and

01:11:38.130 --> 01:11:38.380
at this point you have to say, ‘Mother,
I forgive everyone’. Just say that. Now,

01:11:38.150 --> 01:11:38.400
somebody would say that it’s very difficult
to forgive, and all that. It is all a myth.

01:11:38.179 --> 01:11:38.429
When you don’t forgive anyone, what do you
do? Nothing. You are actually cursing yourself,

01:11:38.199 --> 01:11:38.449
and torturing yourself. So I forgive everyone.
Mother, I forgive everyone. Forgive everyone.

01:11:38.219 --> 01:11:38.469
(Shri Mataji says mantras quietly.)
Now put this hand at the back, on the backside

01:11:38.239 --> 01:11:38.489
of your head, and pull it out a little bit.
Press it a little bit. Now at this point,

01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:38.520
without feeling guilty, again I say without
feeling guilty, at all, just to say, that,

01:11:38.290 --> 01:11:38.540
‘Oh Lord, Oh God, if we have done any mistake,
please forgive us’. But don’t feel guilty.

01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:38.560
(Pause.) At the back, just at the back of
your head. (Longer pause as Mother speaks

01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:38.590
quietly aside to the yogi/yogis.)
Now, put this hand on top of your head, and

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:38.610
press it, on the fontanelle bone area, where
you had a soft bone in your childhood, and

01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:38.630
just press it, and rub it a little bit, and
at this point as I said, I cannot cross your

01:11:38.409 --> 01:11:38.659
freedom. You have to ask for it. You have
to say, ‘Mother, I want my realization,

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:38.690
give me my realization’. Say it seven times
here. Ask for it. You have to ask for it.

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:38.710
You must know that the Divine is not going
to fall at your feet. You have to humble down,

01:11:38.489 --> 01:11:38.739
and ask for it, otherwise it will not work
out. (Pause; Mother speaks again, quietly,

01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:38.760
to yogis.)
Now raise your hand, and see if there’s

01:11:38.530 --> 01:11:39.480
a cool breeze coming in. Just not much, about
five inches, six inches higher, on top of

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:40.719
your head. Now put down right hand, on your
lap. Don’t open your eyes, please. Keep

01:11:40.719 --> 01:11:40.969
quiet.
END

01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:41.180
…tape cuts off here…
