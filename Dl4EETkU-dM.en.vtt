Shri Ganesha Puja, Cabella,
15th September, 1991

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:31.011
Today is the happiest day for all of you,
for the whole universe, because Shri Ganesha

00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:32.751
was created.

00:00:32.751 --> 00:00:46.331
He was created to emit auspiciousness through
His Chaitanya [- Divine Vibrations –ed.].

00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:55.600
First, the whole cosmos was filled with this
Chaitanyasrishti [- creation of Divine Vibrations

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.600
–ed.].

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:05.260
Then Brahmadeva came into play, and He created
all the matter.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:22.191
But

00:01:22.191 --> 00:01:43.391
the greatest blessings of the Divine Power
was to symbolize Chaitanya, and this Chaitanya

00:01:43.391 --> 00:01:53.011
has many aspects, but specially in Shri Ganesha,
it is auspiciousness.

00:01:53.011 --> 00:01:59.901
In these modern times people have lost the
sense of auspiciousness.

00:01:59.901 --> 00:02:07.421
Everything that emits vibrations, Chaitanya,
is auspicious, is shubh, and whatever does

00:02:07.421 --> 00:02:14.091
not is not by any chance auspicious.

00:02:14.091 --> 00:02:23.711
So first of all, whatever you worship, whatever
you accept, all of them have to be auspicious

00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:25.531
things.

00:02:25.531 --> 00:02:34.910
Every shape has a coefficience and all these
shapes which you see, not necessarily give

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.800
vibrations.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:44.761
But in the human beings also, we find there
are many people, like you, who have Chaitanya

00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:46.630
flowing in them.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:54.080
But this Chaitanya when it flows, we just
take Shri Ganesha for granted.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.341
We do not understand that we have to awaken
Shri Ganesha within us.

00:02:59.341 --> 00:03:00.341
Means what?

00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:02.431
What we have to do?

00:03:02.431 --> 00:03:11.391
There is Shri Ganesha already existing in
you and as I said that innocence cannot be

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:19.211
lost, so Shri Ganesha is eternal being, eternal
child – He cannot be lost and He cannot

00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:20.871
be destroyed.

00:03:20.871 --> 00:03:23.100
So He’s all the time there.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:37.140
Maybe some clouds of your ill doings are covering
the great personality of innocence.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.050
But it is always there present.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:51.350
So now, what should we do to keep this Ganesha
all the time shining within us?

00:03:51.350 --> 00:04:00.610
Is to first remember that you were made in
the same pattern as Shri Ganesh.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:10.151
But His Kundalini is on His stomach; His pure
desire is on His stomach.

00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:22.681
It’s very significant to understand why
it is there that His Kundalini is on His stomach.

00:04:22.681 --> 00:04:34.861
That means He does not have to conquer the
temptations of Mooladhara at all.

00:04:34.861 --> 00:04:44.091
But He has His Kundalini on His stomach, that
means He is also beyond the temptations of

00:04:44.091 --> 00:05:02.991
food, of power or anything because His stomach
represents absolute abandonment, absolute

00:05:02.991 --> 00:05:04.171
freedom.

00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:11.491
He’s not bothered as to how He looks that…
these days there is a big fashion that you

00:05:11.491 --> 00:05:12.611
cannot have a big belly.

00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:21.001
I mean this is becoming a big… not only
fashion but a big business.

00:05:21.001 --> 00:05:24.131
But as age grows, you have to have it.

00:05:24.131 --> 00:05:31.261
Even small children have that and they look
so sweet.

00:05:31.261 --> 00:05:39.121
Those people who are very thin must understand
that they might be getting some prizes in

00:05:39.121 --> 00:05:54.251
the… maybe beauty contest or something,
but they do not have that majesty, that royalty,

00:05:54.251 --> 00:05:58.931
that dignity in them as they should have.

00:05:58.931 --> 00:06:02.531
So Shri Ganesha accepts everything.

00:06:02.531 --> 00:06:09.301
He has a head with a trunk.

00:06:09.301 --> 00:06:11.871
He accepts it.

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:15.141
Of course, is important, He should have that.

00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:21.091
Because head of the elephant suggests that
He is not like a human being who develops

00:06:21.091 --> 00:06:30.921
ego, superego, conditionings, but He is just
all the time one with the Divine.

00:06:30.921 --> 00:06:37.361
He accepts His body, He accepts His head,
He accepts His ears, He accepts everything

00:06:37.361 --> 00:06:40.431
that He is made of.

00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:48.801
He doesn’t aspire to something – some
entrepreneurs put some ideas and He wouldn’t

00:06:48.801 --> 00:06:50.741
go run after them.

00:06:50.741 --> 00:06:59.501
He won’t try to change Himself; He won’t
try to create that fashion and all that.

00:06:59.501 --> 00:07:12.301
He is what He is… because He is a satisfied
soul.

00:07:12.301 --> 00:07:25.901
The Kundalini on the stomach shows a complete,
self-contented, satisfied personality of Shri

00:07:25.901 --> 00:07:27.871
Ganesha.

00:07:27.871 --> 00:07:38.481
When you have all the powers within you, you
know you are powerful, then you don’t hanker

00:07:38.481 --> 00:07:48.671
after all these things and you don’t try
to make a position or an impression of others.

00:07:48.671 --> 00:07:57.821
For example, He would never go and read books
like how to impress people.

00:07:57.821 --> 00:08:03.541
Very common.

00:08:03.541 --> 00:08:12.121
So now, as you are created in the same image
of Shri Ganesh, you have to understand that

00:08:12.121 --> 00:08:20.381
you have to accept whatever God has given
you, whatever position He has given you.

00:08:20.381 --> 00:08:21.871
Same with Christ.

00:08:21.871 --> 00:08:27.111
Christ accepted His father who was just a
carpenter.

00:08:27.111 --> 00:08:33.651
He didn’t aspire for something higher or
some sort of a special position or a power

00:08:33.651 --> 00:08:44.141
because He was so powerful – what more power
can He have?

00:08:44.141 --> 00:08:51.191
Though people mocked at Him and laughed at
Him and could not accept what He was saying,

00:08:51.191 --> 00:08:58.601
but still He was self-contented, self-satisfied.

00:08:58.601 --> 00:09:00.721
He knew what it was.

00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:11.271
So, for a Sahaja Yogi first thing is to be
self-contented.

00:09:11.271 --> 00:09:21.901
As I told you, the fundamentals of the western
life is to see and to be seen.

00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:32.911
Both things were missing completely in the
incarnation of Shri Ganesh.

00:09:32.911 --> 00:09:38.351
So when I say these things, suddenly people
start thinking, “Let us become hippies,

00:09:38.351 --> 00:09:43.581
or let them become punks, or let us become
this, let us become that.”

00:09:43.581 --> 00:09:45.521
You don’t have to become anything.

00:09:45.521 --> 00:09:52.731
Whatever you have – your body, your face,
your hair – everything is there, just meant

00:09:52.731 --> 00:09:57.961
for you.

00:09:57.961 --> 00:10:12.591
You don’t have to change anything outwardly
because inside is complete Chaitanya.

00:10:12.591 --> 00:10:18.731
Shri Ganesha never tried to change Himself.

00:10:18.731 --> 00:10:33.841
Though there were so many clouds on His being,
though many people insulted Him, tortured

00:10:33.841 --> 00:10:43.821
Him, hanged Him, crucified Him, still the
Eternal Being didn’t bother.

00:10:43.821 --> 00:10:57.321
So the first and foremost thing for a Sahaja
Yogi is to accept, go on accepting things.

00:10:57.321 --> 00:11:02.501
But when I say accept, I must say the other
side also: that doesn’t mean you start accepting

00:11:02.501 --> 00:11:07.181
bhoots, all the bad qualities of others.

00:11:07.181 --> 00:11:13.361
“Mother, You said you must accept”, so
they’ll start accepting all these bad qualities.

00:11:13.361 --> 00:11:14.681
“What’s wrong?

00:11:14.681 --> 00:11:17.411
You have said it already.”

00:11:17.411 --> 00:11:21.831
Whatever I say has another side, always.

00:11:21.831 --> 00:11:26.031
Like I said, “Now you have become your own
Guru.”

00:11:26.031 --> 00:11:29.771
So, “Why should we listen to anybody else?”

00:11:29.771 --> 00:11:46.431
Like this, you see, we go on diverting ourselves,
deviating ourselves from reality just to cheat

00:11:46.431 --> 00:11:48.591
ourselves.

00:11:48.591 --> 00:11:53.761
And this comes because we have no wisdom.

00:11:53.761 --> 00:12:00.141
We have no wisdom because we do not know what
is for our benevolence, what is for our good,

00:12:00.141 --> 00:12:01.711
what we should do for our good.

00:12:01.711 --> 00:12:05.641
I mean even if we know, we don’t want to
do it.

00:12:05.641 --> 00:12:08.931
So, what we lack is wisdom.

00:12:08.931 --> 00:12:14.360
That’s a vicious circle, I must say, that
Ganesha is to be awakened to give you wisdom

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:24.891
– He is the giver of wisdom, He is the giver
of wisdom – and He has to give you the wisdom,

00:12:24.891 --> 00:12:30.041
He is to be awakened; but you are not wise
because He is not awakened.

00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:35.810
It’s a very vicious circle.

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:39.351
How to make this vicious circle break?

00:12:39.351 --> 00:12:45.781
That “Let my wisdom shine in my attention.

00:12:45.781 --> 00:12:54.671
Let Shri Ganesha throw His light in my attention.”

00:12:54.671 --> 00:13:00.411
Mentally you people are very alert, no doubt.

00:13:00.411 --> 00:13:10.001
And you can always cheat yourself nicely.

00:13:10.001 --> 00:13:21.841
That’s the point where you could see yourself
– introspection, which I have seen among

00:13:21.841 --> 00:13:26.141
Russians.

00:13:26.141 --> 00:13:30.451
Just introspect: “Why do I do like that?

00:13:30.451 --> 00:13:33.560
Why cannot I meditate?

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:39.361
Am I going to miss out?

00:13:39.361 --> 00:13:47.781
Why can I not do something that is good for
me?”

00:13:47.781 --> 00:13:57.921
Introspection is the only way you can see
yourself how far you are from Shri Ganesh.

00:13:57.921 --> 00:14:09.781
Even, I have seen, when I say something in
general, people always – the mind is very

00:14:09.781 --> 00:14:15.361
clever – thinks that I am talking about
somebody else, not about them.

00:14:15.361 --> 00:14:24.081
It’s a convex mind, convex, which never
receives anything inside itself because there

00:14:24.081 --> 00:14:29.481
is no wisdom.

00:14:29.481 --> 00:14:40.031
If you are wise, then not only that you’ll
accept but you’ll understand and it will

00:14:40.031 --> 00:14:45.871
penetrate into your attention through your
central nervous system.

00:14:45.871 --> 00:14:49.511
You just know that this is it.

00:14:49.511 --> 00:14:57.332
Now you know that this… you put your hand
towards this candle, it… you’ll… your

00:14:57.332 --> 00:14:58.461
fingers might burn.

00:14:58.461 --> 00:15:04.421
You know it definitely, with experience, and
you won’t do that.

00:15:04.421 --> 00:15:12.831
With experience you have learnt not to put
your hand on to the candle.

00:15:12.831 --> 00:15:18.501
And this wisdom is there, I don’t have to
tell you that.

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:22.401
But this is a new life you have started – a
spiritual life.

00:15:22.401 --> 00:15:31.201
When you are going into the spiritual life,
try to remember your experiences, one after

00:15:31.201 --> 00:15:36.761
another: how you got transformed, how you
changed, how many the bad things that you

00:15:36.761 --> 00:15:41.781
had disappeared gradually and how you have
become so nice.

00:15:41.781 --> 00:15:50.501
This will take away your depression – to
begin with.

00:15:50.501 --> 00:15:54.911
Then you should think that, “What do I have
to do further?

00:15:54.911 --> 00:15:56.171
Am I really wise, or I’m stupid?”

00:15:56.171 --> 00:16:06.321
There are lots of stages between absolute
stupidity and absolute wisdom, and you see

00:16:06.321 --> 00:16:16.961
all those shades all over, and combinations
and permutations of these I see every day.

00:16:16.961 --> 00:16:28.551
And I am surprised that after getting your
Self Realization, when Shri Ganesha is shining

00:16:28.551 --> 00:16:36.791
in your attention, you should see your reflection
clearly and try to correct it.

00:16:36.791 --> 00:16:45.791
Only this much wisdom if you have that, “I
have to work out my benevolence”, you’ll

00:16:45.791 --> 00:16:48.870
do it.

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:55.060
I know of somebody who would never get up
in the mornings, say for example.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:17:00.501
But one day I saw him ready at about six o’clock
in the morning – I was surprised.

00:17:00.501 --> 00:17:05.980
How this gentleman who has no self-discipline
has suddenly got up at six o’clock and ready

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:07.681
to go somewhere.

00:17:07.681 --> 00:17:11.811
I said, “Where are you going?”

00:17:11.811 --> 00:17:14.211
“You don’t know?”

00:17:14.211 --> 00:17:15.211
I said, “What?”

00:17:15.211 --> 00:17:22.120
“I have got a job now and I have to be present
at 8 o’clock and it will take two hours

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:23.321
to reach that place.

00:17:23.321 --> 00:17:25.340
Also, I am keeping some margin.

00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:26.881
So I have to leave now.

00:17:26.881 --> 00:17:29.031
I can’t talk to You even.”

00:17:29.031 --> 00:17:33.641
Quite alert, awake.

00:17:33.641 --> 00:17:43.271
Now, what is the thing is as far as money
is concerned, lot of wisdom is there.

00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:51.121
Don’t have to tell them, that is automatically.

00:17:51.121 --> 00:18:02.251
Money wisdom is quite a lot, job wisdom is
quite a lot.

00:18:02.251 --> 00:18:14.421
Because these things means prestige in the
society, this means security in the society.

00:18:14.421 --> 00:18:20.801
So this kind of business you find in many
people and in some even that is missing.

00:18:20.801 --> 00:18:26.221
They don’t even understand that they have
to earn their living.

00:18:26.221 --> 00:18:36.141
But that’s the minimum, you cannot be parasite.

00:18:36.141 --> 00:18:42.381
Then the second stage, as I said by many stages,
is this: that we are not for money, money

00:18:42.381 --> 00:18:52.021
is for us.

00:18:52.021 --> 00:19:04.801
The attention if it is on your Spirit, on
the Ganesha Principle, then whole situation

00:19:04.801 --> 00:19:07.611
will change.

00:19:07.611 --> 00:19:13.231
Your priorities will change.

00:19:13.231 --> 00:19:17.461
And suddenly people will say, “Mother, what
has happened to this gentleman?

00:19:17.461 --> 00:19:29.011
He was a stupid fool, now he has become such
a wise person.”

00:19:29.011 --> 00:19:34.011
So to awaken Shri Ganesha you should have
minimum wisdom already there.

00:19:34.011 --> 00:19:38.541
I mean, even if that is not there, how can
you work it out?

00:19:38.541 --> 00:19:47.491
Is not meant for stupid people, Moodhas, not
meant for Moodh.

00:19:47.491 --> 00:19:50.461
So now what is our benevolence is?

00:19:50.461 --> 00:19:55.461
Let us see.

00:19:55.461 --> 00:19:57.291
Is it money?

00:19:57.291 --> 00:19:58.881
No.

00:19:58.881 --> 00:20:06.761
Those who have money don’t seem to be very
happy people always.

00:20:06.761 --> 00:20:08.431
Then what is the next, is jobs?

00:20:08.431 --> 00:20:13.761
Those who have jobs – all right, should
have jobs, I am not saying you should be jobless.

00:20:13.761 --> 00:20:21.301
I mean immediately the another side they will
take, I mean so quick you know, that, “Mother

00:20:21.301 --> 00:20:29.291
is saying we can be jobless you see, nice.”

00:20:29.291 --> 00:20:31.071
Immediate, escapes.

00:20:31.071 --> 00:20:38.931
Now, then the power: you want to have political
power, this social power, this power, that

00:20:38.931 --> 00:20:45.751
power – is absolutely a joyless pursuit.

00:20:45.751 --> 00:20:53.741
You go and see those people who are supposed
to be powerful, so called, half way they are

00:20:53.741 --> 00:21:04.330
towards hell, one foot there and one foot
here and about to be gulped down by the crocodiles.

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:10.450
You can see it clearly.

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:16.580
Specially in this Kali Yuga it’s so obvious,
so clear-cut.

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:24.781
We don’t want to be like them, we want to
be like Shri Ganesh.

00:21:24.781 --> 00:21:30.801
So once you start accepting your circumstances,
accepting your body, your… accepting your

00:21:30.801 --> 00:21:48.960
face, everything, you will see that lot of
time will be saved.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:59.301
Another problem that faces us is planning.

00:21:59.301 --> 00:22:02.721
And that is missing in Shri Ganesha completely.

00:22:02.721 --> 00:22:05.331
He did not do any planning whatsoever.

00:22:05.331 --> 00:22:12.531
I wish He had done some planning, things would
have been much better.

00:22:12.531 --> 00:22:19.281
He doesn’t believe in planning because He
is so powerful.

00:22:19.281 --> 00:22:23.741
Whatever He wants, He can get it done.

00:22:23.741 --> 00:22:24.741
You want the sun?

00:22:24.741 --> 00:22:26.821
All right the sun is there.

00:22:26.821 --> 00:22:27.821
You want the moon?

00:22:27.821 --> 00:22:28.821
Moon is there.

00:22:28.821 --> 00:22:29.821
You want the stars?

00:22:29.821 --> 00:22:30.821
Stars is there.

00:22:30.821 --> 00:22:42.311
The
dust of His feet can create the whole universe

00:22:42.311 --> 00:22:48.001
– universes after universes.

00:22:48.001 --> 00:23:00.001
For such a person, there is no need to be
planning everything because whatever He wants

00:23:00.001 --> 00:23:03.011
happens.

00:23:03.011 --> 00:23:06.061
But why, why it happens?

00:23:06.061 --> 00:23:10.771
Why He has this power?

00:23:10.771 --> 00:23:15.090
Because He is in that state.

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:23.601
Are you in that state?

00:23:23.601 --> 00:23:26.571
You have not achieved that state.

00:23:26.571 --> 00:23:37.281
You talk somebody… tell somebody that, “Oh
my, I have to go and catch the plane.”

00:23:37.281 --> 00:23:42.681
There are ten people standing next to you,
they’ll all get panicky.

00:23:42.681 --> 00:23:49.830
I have to go, and they are bothered; something
sort of goes off their heads.

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:53.710
I don’t know what goes, they go amuck.

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:55.161
I never tell them like that.

00:23:55.161 --> 00:24:00.591
I say, “There’s still time for the plane
to go, and don’t worry.

00:24:00.591 --> 00:24:09.441
When I reach there then the plane will leave
so you don’t worry.”

00:24:09.441 --> 00:24:22.751
But because of this kind of a… presumptions,
and the planning system of the mind, you just

00:24:22.751 --> 00:24:27.751
think that, “Now I have a plan to go today,
I must go.”

00:24:27.751 --> 00:24:28.751
Why?

00:24:28.751 --> 00:24:31.041
I won’t go.

00:24:31.041 --> 00:24:33.631
I may decide at the last minute I don’t
want to go.

00:24:33.631 --> 00:24:36.081
I’ll make the plane go away.

00:24:36.081 --> 00:24:41.131
We did that many a times, you know very well.

00:24:41.131 --> 00:24:48.941
I wanted to buy the Rome Ashram, so I saw
to it that the plane never arrived.

00:24:48.941 --> 00:24:53.941
But you have to be in that state.

00:24:53.941 --> 00:24:57.171
Specially buying this Cabella, you know what
happened.

00:24:57.171 --> 00:25:05.241
There were five great intellectuals on My
head sitting.

00:25:05.241 --> 00:25:10.131
I didn’t know how I will manage these five
intellectuals with all their planning, this,

00:25:10.131 --> 00:25:19.511
that; they made Me run up and down, do this
and that, Ultimately they all had to come

00:25:19.511 --> 00:25:21.521
here.

00:25:21.521 --> 00:25:23.561
But I was telling them, “Go and have a look.”

00:25:23.561 --> 00:25:35.061
Nobody would look at it, nobody would listen
to Me, nobody wanted to know about it.

00:25:35.061 --> 00:25:48.061
How things work out – is your pure desire
that can work out anything that you want.

00:25:48.061 --> 00:25:51.981
But you won’t want funny things also.

00:25:51.981 --> 00:25:56.971
Like Shri Ganesha would not like to follow
some entrepreneur who is saying, “Have a

00:25:56.971 --> 00:26:00.700
punk on your head”, or something.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:05.131
Is stupidity, all kinds of stupidities.

00:26:05.131 --> 00:26:11.281
Because you are stupid, these entrepreneurs
are having a good time; they can befool us

00:26:11.281 --> 00:26:13.871
all the time.

00:26:13.871 --> 00:26:26.211
At His state, He is Himself, on top of the
pure desire.

00:26:26.211 --> 00:26:32.171
The pure desire is on His stomach, tied up
nicely.

00:26:32.171 --> 00:26:49.561
It is to be seen in Sahaja Yoga how things
work out, how miraculously they work out,

00:26:49.561 --> 00:26:51.981
and these can happen to you also.

00:26:51.981 --> 00:26:58.611
All these Powers can come to you also.

00:26:58.611 --> 00:27:03.871
You know about some people who came to us
who didn’t know even how to sing.

00:27:03.871 --> 00:27:08.191
I mean, they had no voices; something very
funny they had – I mean I didn’t know

00:27:08.191 --> 00:27:13.820
from where they learnt to even talk.

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:19.431
When they opened their mouths, if you were
at one note, they were on another note and

00:27:19.431 --> 00:27:25.001
they went on and on and on without even listening
to what they were singing.

00:27:25.001 --> 00:27:33.071
After some time, I find they are singing beautifully.

00:27:33.071 --> 00:27:37.871
So the Kundalini itself is working it out,
the pure desire is working it out, but what

00:27:37.871 --> 00:27:39.401
about you?

00:27:39.401 --> 00:27:45.721
What are you doing about it is to be seen.

00:27:45.721 --> 00:27:59.261
There are so many things that could be understood
very easily through the lifestyle of Shri

00:27:59.261 --> 00:28:00.271
Ganesha.

00:28:00.271 --> 00:28:14.830
The first and foremost thing for Him is to
obey His Mother – never to say no, no question,

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:24.001
and also not to ask why.

00:28:24.001 --> 00:28:32.151
He will go and fight with all the Gods and
Goddesses and every one.

00:28:32.151 --> 00:28:39.281
And that’s what Christ has said, “Anything
against Me I’ve tolerated but nothing against

00:28:39.281 --> 00:28:43.940
the Holy Ghost.”

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:58.631
There should be no question, there should
be no explanation.

00:28:58.631 --> 00:29:08.011
Sometimes even My patience goes out, the way
they do not want to accept what I am telling

00:29:08.011 --> 00:29:09.011
them.

00:29:09.011 --> 00:29:14.061
At the end of course they all come around,
no doubt – at the end.

00:29:14.061 --> 00:29:17.421
But you waste so much time convincing them.

00:29:17.421 --> 00:29:20.681
What is the reason?

00:29:20.681 --> 00:29:24.461
They have no wisdom to know what their Mother
is.

00:29:24.461 --> 00:29:33.681
Like, you know the story of Shri Ganesha that
His Mother said, “The one who goes round

00:29:33.681 --> 00:29:39.570
the Mother Earth, I will give you a present.”

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:50.690
So, Ganesha again accepts a little mouse as
a transport – imagine.

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:57.161
Nowadays people can’t believe it that Shri
Ganesha, so powerful, should accept just a

00:29:57.161 --> 00:29:59.631
mouse for His transport.

00:29:59.631 --> 00:30:11.381
Because He’s so humble; he doesn’t have
to show off His Lincoln or Mercedes to anyone;

00:30:11.381 --> 00:30:17.641
He is very comfortable with His mouse.

00:30:17.641 --> 00:30:20.931
Now what does He do?

00:30:20.931 --> 00:30:23.921
He thinks that…

00:30:23.921 --> 00:30:30.821
He understands, in no time, that His Mother
is much greater than the Mother Earth.

00:30:30.821 --> 00:30:35.340
“So why should I go round the Mother Earth?”

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:42.781
His brother is going round on a peacock.

00:30:42.781 --> 00:30:47.991
He just goes round His Mother – He gets
the present.

00:30:47.991 --> 00:31:02.551
It’s such a simple thing to understand because
He is the wisest person.

00:31:02.551 --> 00:31:19.201
The wisest person knows what is what, he knows
who is who, he knows what are the qualities

00:31:19.201 --> 00:31:21.311
of these persons.

00:31:21.311 --> 00:31:32.241
He is not impressed by superficial things,
no.

00:31:32.241 --> 00:31:40.371
If somebody is well dressed, then people get
very much impressed by them, and they turn

00:31:40.371 --> 00:31:53.611
out to be bank robbers – walking with umbrellas
and with lined suits, as if some big executives

00:31:53.611 --> 00:32:04.001
are coming, and they decamp with all the loot.

00:32:04.001 --> 00:32:16.411
So for a wise person, the superficial behavior
doesn’t appeal, not bothered.

00:32:16.411 --> 00:32:32.060
It is a kind of a very penetrating intelligence;
just like a computer you know.

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:34.401
In a second you know that what is this gentleman.

00:32:34.401 --> 00:32:41.580
Oh, he may come with a great, you see, ado
and he might come and praise you and do this

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:51.141
and do that and you know the person very well.

00:32:51.141 --> 00:33:01.971
If some body is unduly very friendly, very
kind, very nice, not necessarily that he is

00:33:01.971 --> 00:33:12.580
really appreciating you but he is looking
at your purse, maybe, maybe something else.

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:22.090
But not only on this level, it is even on
a spiritual level we have to understand how

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:34.121
people try to put you down spiritually; what
they try, what tricks they try on you.

00:33:34.121 --> 00:33:42.161
It could be your husband, your wife, your
children, your relations, your friends, anybody,

00:33:42.161 --> 00:33:44.231
any Sahaja Yogi.

00:33:44.231 --> 00:33:47.251
But in the case of Shri Ganesha, it’s the
other way round.

00:33:47.251 --> 00:33:53.651
They say that if you put one apple, bad apple,
all the apples get spoilt.

00:33:53.651 --> 00:34:04.931
But if you put Shri Ganesha among all the
bad apples, they’ll get all right.

00:34:04.931 --> 00:34:09.911
Because He’s the life-giving force.

00:34:09.911 --> 00:34:25.901
This is one of the greatest qualities, that
He knows that He is the source of life and

00:34:25.901 --> 00:34:29.301
He gives life, He gives Chaitanya.

00:34:29.301 --> 00:34:37.581
He doesn’t say… think that, “Now supposing
I give Chaitanya, give life to this person,

00:34:37.581 --> 00:34:40.991
my ego will come up,” – very common problem.

00:34:40.991 --> 00:34:48.081
“Mother I don’t want to do it because
my ego will come up.”

00:34:48.081 --> 00:34:52.150
Everybody is psychoanalyzing themselves ‘because
this will happen’ – Baba!

00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:54.031
[- Hindi expression of a general exclamatory
nature –ed.]

00:34:54.031 --> 00:34:58.741
You are all realized souls now, you are all
saints.

00:34:58.741 --> 00:35:04.941
The false people are talking so big, and you
the people who have got something are still

00:35:04.941 --> 00:35:08.281
thinking, “My ego will come up, this will
happen.”

00:35:08.281 --> 00:35:14.161
No, no, you have the powers.

00:35:14.161 --> 00:35:24.981
But as you keep it under a manger, as Christ
has said, the light will go out.

00:35:24.981 --> 00:35:36.900
You have to give it to others, you have to
open it out.

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.981
And that is how you will judge your state.

00:35:38.981 --> 00:35:41.631
“What is my state?

00:35:41.631 --> 00:35:43.701
Let’s see.

00:35:43.701 --> 00:35:46.791
Where am I?”

00:35:46.791 --> 00:35:54.281
That confidence, take it from Me, should be
with you.

00:35:54.281 --> 00:35:59.821
All of you have to work out this way.

00:35:59.821 --> 00:36:01.801
Very many…

00:36:01.801 --> 00:36:04.071
“Mother, my Mooladhara is caught up.”

00:36:04.071 --> 00:36:07.951
How dare anybody catch Mooladhar?

00:36:07.951 --> 00:36:12.001
That’s the anger of Shri Ganesha.

00:36:12.001 --> 00:36:15.291
How dare?

00:36:15.291 --> 00:36:18.900
How can anybody?

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:27.701
What’s missing is complete faith in yourself
and faith in your Mother.

00:36:27.701 --> 00:36:35.681
In Russia recently… in Prague, there was
a lady who was brought on the stage, very

00:36:35.681 --> 00:36:36.881
old lady, couldn’t walk.

00:36:36.881 --> 00:36:43.150
I mean they just carried her and she came
and sat before Me on a chair.

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:45.411
She said, “I know You…

00:36:45.411 --> 00:36:46.761
I’ll be cured.

00:36:46.761 --> 00:36:50.671
I am in Your presence; I know I will be cured.”

00:36:50.671 --> 00:36:51.791
I said, “Then get up.”

00:36:51.791 --> 00:36:53.021
She got up.

00:36:53.021 --> 00:36:57.561
Those who were with Me in Prague, you can
ask them.

00:36:57.561 --> 00:37:03.900
She came down and she started running, and
everybody laughed.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:16.581
But her faith – she was not a Sahaja Yogini
as such – but she was sure; she knew Me.

00:37:16.581 --> 00:37:20.691
And she just started running like that and
everybody started looking at her.

00:37:20.691 --> 00:37:29.391
Same thing happened in Russia for many people
– very serious diseases.

00:37:29.391 --> 00:37:38.390
So that, one thing is for sure, either you
don’t know that you are realized souls or

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:42.661
else you don’t know Me, one of the two things.

00:37:42.661 --> 00:37:45.671
Why was He so obedient to His Mother?

00:37:45.671 --> 00:37:47.341
Why was He?

00:37:47.341 --> 00:37:49.121
Because that was the wisest thing to do.

00:37:49.121 --> 00:38:01.341
The one who knows everything, it’s better
to be guided by that person.

00:38:01.341 --> 00:38:05.721
And many a times I have seen, people try to
do things without telling Me, important things

00:38:05.721 --> 00:38:08.590
– they fall into traps.

00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:15.831
Then they come back to Me and I tell them
the solution, it works.

00:38:15.831 --> 00:38:21.391
It’s not necessary that you should tell
Me everything.

00:38:21.391 --> 00:38:32.471
But when you are in a fix, you can always
just go into yourself and ask yourself, “What

00:38:32.471 --> 00:38:33.501
would Mother do?”

00:38:33.501 --> 00:38:36.441
You’ll get the answer.

00:38:36.441 --> 00:38:38.791
You are at a… quite a higher state.

00:38:38.791 --> 00:38:44.211
But still, even if you are on a tree and you
are still thinking you are falling down, you

00:38:44.211 --> 00:38:46.461
are nowhere.

00:38:46.461 --> 00:38:48.711
Steady yourself.

00:38:48.711 --> 00:38:58.551
That’s what is, we say, the Adhishthan of
Shri Ganesha.

00:38:58.551 --> 00:39:07.261
Is the steadiness, steadiness in your achievements
of Sahaj Yog.

00:39:07.261 --> 00:39:15.101
Believing in yourself that you have entered
into the new world, into the new atmosphere

00:39:16.839 --> 00:39:22.252
It is for you now, to work it out.

00:39:22.253 --> 00:39:29.433
Shri Ganesha is just waiting.

00:39:29.433 --> 00:39:33.323
But He is not meant for people who have no
courage.

00:39:33.323 --> 00:39:50.306
Such a courageous man who could go and fight
with all the Devas, because He knew the Shakti

00:39:50.306 --> 00:39:56.913
was with Him.

00:39:56.913 --> 00:40:06.273
Today is such a joyous day for Me because
we have children, and we are dealing with

00:40:06.273 --> 00:40:07.273
children.

00:40:07.273 --> 00:40:09.273
Most of them are born realized.

00:40:09.273 --> 00:40:20.273
They are of a very special category, I have
told you many a times, but we spoil them;

00:40:20.273 --> 00:40:28.383
because we were not born realized, so we don’t
know how to handle these children, we spoil

00:40:28.383 --> 00:40:29.383
them.

00:40:29.383 --> 00:40:34.913
Not only we spoil them, but we interfere with
the school, we interfere with this as if we

00:40:34.913 --> 00:40:45.033
are the wisest parents ever living.

00:40:45.033 --> 00:40:51.543
Because we are Sahaja Yogis, we have to be
much more sensible than other parents.

00:40:51.543 --> 00:40:55.053
How can you interfere with any school anywhere?

00:40:55.053 --> 00:41:03.073
But in Sahaja Yoga you will.

00:41:03.073 --> 00:41:13.303
It is because there is no wisdom and no understanding
what is good and benevolent for your child.

00:41:13.303 --> 00:41:18.273
If you love your child, then you must think
of its benevolent.

00:41:18.273 --> 00:41:25.163
You must learn from the experience what happens
to children if they are left like that.

00:41:25.163 --> 00:41:32.313
You cannot spoil your child, you cannot because
it’s a special category of children they

00:41:32.313 --> 00:41:33.313
are.

00:41:33.313 --> 00:41:44.653
They are not children who can become vagabonds;
they cannot become thieves.

00:41:44.653 --> 00:41:52.343
So you will make them something funny – they
are neither here nor there.

00:41:52.343 --> 00:42:00.943
They are born realized and they have to be
channelized properly, to achieve their complete

00:42:00.943 --> 00:42:08.773
manifestation of their Spirit.

00:42:08.773 --> 00:42:18.952
So the possessiveness and the stupid attachments
to children must be given up.

00:42:18.952 --> 00:42:24.783
There is no force on you – if you want to
destroy a child, you can destroy.

00:42:24.783 --> 00:42:31.433
But in an advice – if you were Ganeshas,
you would have understood it, I don’t have

00:42:31.433 --> 00:42:35.623
to explain so much.

00:42:35.623 --> 00:42:43.283
What is good for your child, because we have
to have beautiful children.

00:42:43.283 --> 00:42:45.573
They are born beautiful children, I tell you.

00:42:45.573 --> 00:42:50.303
If they are spoilt, it is because of you,
you have spoilt them.

00:42:50.303 --> 00:42:52.723
You have ruined them.

00:42:52.723 --> 00:42:55.283
You are responsible.

00:42:55.283 --> 00:43:03.183
I know of so many children – they’re very,
very sweet.

00:43:03.183 --> 00:43:10.883
I have conference with them also and I find
them much more congenial; I have much better

00:43:10.883 --> 00:43:16.043
rapport with them than I can have with you.

00:43:16.043 --> 00:43:19.123
They never argue, never.

00:43:19.123 --> 00:43:29.972
They never says no, and they have very good
information about all of you.

00:43:29.972 --> 00:43:36.913
So it is such a nice thing that today you
should desire that our children should very

00:43:36.913 --> 00:43:47.763
soon become the images of Shri Ganesha, His
Ganas, who have to work out so much.

00:43:47.763 --> 00:43:51.043
It’s a tremendous task.

00:43:51.043 --> 00:43:59.023
Sahaja Yoga is the greatest achievement of
Spiritual evolution.

00:43:59.023 --> 00:44:03.623
We all have to dedicate ourselves.

00:44:03.623 --> 00:44:09.593
We don’t have to sacrifice anything as the
Saints have sacrificed – nothing, don’t

00:44:09.593 --> 00:44:11.173
have to suffer anything.

00:44:11.173 --> 00:44:14.073
Only thing you have to have – wisdom.

00:44:14.073 --> 00:44:20.492
For that, I am very happy that today we are
worshipping Shri Ganesha.

00:44:20.492 --> 00:44:29.193
So the pure desire should be that, “Shri
Ganesha please give us Divine Wisdom.”

00:44:29.193 --> 00:44:31.173
That’s all.

00:44:31.173 --> 00:44:34.056
It contains everything in it.

00:44:34.057 --> 00:44:36.042
May God bless you.
