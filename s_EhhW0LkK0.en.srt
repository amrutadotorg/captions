1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,705
﻿So, this is to thank you all for

2
00:00:06,335 --> 00:00:08,877
helping in building this house

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,517
and making it so beautiful.

4
00:00:16,507 --> 00:00:18,397
All the thankfulness

5
00:00:20,054 --> 00:00:21,803
is from

6
00:00:22,678 --> 00:00:24,991
us, both of us, to you.

7
00:00:27,948 --> 00:00:29,554
Today is a very

8
00:00:29,755 --> 00:00:32,260
interesting day when

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,277
you are worshipping the Gruhalakshmi here,

10
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,317
means the Gruhalakshmi of this house.

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,041
In the same way

12
00:00:43,267 --> 00:00:46,723
in your family also, in your houses, homes you must

13
00:00:46,923 --> 00:00:48,813
do Gruhalakshmis’ puja.

14
00:00:49,944 --> 00:00:51,933
The woman has to be

15
00:00:52,134 --> 00:00:54,145
the Gruhalakshmi herself

16
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:57,289
and then she should be worshipped.

17
00:00:58,022 --> 00:01:00,972
“Yatya naria pujyante, tatra bhramante Devata.”

18
00:01:01,173 --> 00:01:03,397
Where the women are respected

19
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:06,139
and worshipped there

20
00:01:07,144 --> 00:01:09,772
reside all the deities.

21
00:01:09,973 --> 00:01:12,077
But they should be respectable also.

22
00:01:12,277 --> 00:01:14,445
If they are not respectable

23
00:01:14,645 --> 00:01:17,153
then the deities won’t reside there.

24
00:01:17,354 --> 00:01:18,932
So, it’s a big responsibility

25
00:01:19,132 --> 00:01:21,357
on a Gruhalakshmi to be respectable

26
00:01:21,557 --> 00:01:24,476
so that all the deities are happy in the family.

27
00:01:24,676 --> 00:01:26,917
And once she is respected,

28
00:01:27,117 --> 00:01:30,477
she will try to be respectable also.

29
00:01:30,677 --> 00:01:32,197
So, the respect

30
00:01:32,397 --> 00:01:35,016
of the Gruhalakshmi is very important.

31
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,797
Today

32
00:01:40,006 --> 00:01:43,237
we are having this little puja

33
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:45,443
from all the builders

34
00:01:45,643 --> 00:01:47,648
who helped us here,

35
00:01:48,037 --> 00:01:50,116
with the blessings of Vishwakarma

36
00:01:50,317 --> 00:01:51,985
and Brahmadeva;

37
00:01:52,186 --> 00:01:54,335
those who have tried

38
00:01:54,672 --> 00:01:57,872
to make this house so beautiful.

39
00:01:59,428 --> 00:02:02,932
Also, as you know, Blake has described this house.

40
00:02:03,132 --> 00:02:05,677
It has a special significance

41
00:02:06,353 --> 00:02:08,815
and we have to now

42
00:02:09,015 --> 00:02:10,677
hand it over to somebody else,

43
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:15,317
the one who will appreciate and respect this house;

44
00:02:15,772 --> 00:02:19,117
who will understand the value and worth of this house.

45
00:02:19,477 --> 00:02:21,900
And for that we have to pray

46
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,419
that it will be sold to such a person

47
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,421
who is a person who will be

48
00:02:28,622 --> 00:02:32,424
a connoisseur, a person who will understand

49
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:35,597
the depth and the

50
00:02:36,626 --> 00:02:38,277
aesthetics

51
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,877
of this place

52
00:02:41,648 --> 00:02:45,004
and the one who will be paying for that,

53
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:46,986
valuing that.

54
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,437
So, we have to ask

55
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:51,317
for such a blessing.

56
00:02:56,068 --> 00:02:58,759
Of course, one should not get attached to anything.

57
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,797
Whatever is created,

58
00:03:01,568 --> 00:03:03,981
is created. One should never be attached.

59
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:05,797
Because we have done this, so

60
00:03:05,997 --> 00:03:09,397
we should be attached to it, is not the way a Sahaja

61
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,494
Yogi should think about it.

62
00:03:11,695 --> 00:03:14,779
But one should think about that,
now we have created something beautiful

63
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:16,757
we can recreate another thing

64
00:03:16,957 --> 00:03:19,900
and we can produce other better things.

65
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,397
That’s how an artist

66
00:03:21,597 --> 00:03:24,234
can go on producing and producing.

67
00:03:24,435 --> 00:03:25,717
Of course,

68
00:03:25,917 --> 00:03:28,437
there’s one thing: that if there is

69
00:03:28,787 --> 00:03:31,677
within us the joy,

70
00:03:34,596 --> 00:03:37,630
then only you produce joy.

71
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:40,157
If there is no joy you cannot.

72
00:03:41,811 --> 00:03:43,517
So first of all

73
00:03:43,717 --> 00:03:45,947
before doing any work

74
00:03:46,148 --> 00:03:47,808
creating anything

75
00:03:48,237 --> 00:03:50,037
one must measure up

76
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,437
the amount of

77
00:03:53,841 --> 00:03:55,755
joy one has received,

78
00:03:55,955 --> 00:03:59,113
the blessings one has received from the Divine,

79
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,117
and then recreate.

80
00:04:01,317 --> 00:04:04,661
With that consciousness, with that awareness

81
00:04:04,862 --> 00:04:07,237
you’ll find your creation will be very beautiful.

82
00:04:07,437 --> 00:04:10,726
And we have to bring the world to a new

83
00:04:11,616 --> 00:04:14,237
method of creativity

84
00:04:14,852 --> 00:04:17,077
where there is exuberance,

85
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:19,197
exuberance,

86
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,308
of joy and

87
00:04:24,293 --> 00:04:27,917
of Divine aesthetics,

88
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,905
because the world is going from bad to worse.

89
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,373
I find nowadays people may just like to have

90
00:04:35,597 --> 00:04:39,317
some sort of a white cloth hanging and calling it a painting.

91
00:04:39,885 --> 00:04:42,421
That’s not a painting because there is nothing inside.

92
00:04:42,622 --> 00:04:45,277
It has become hollow, empty; there’s nothing inside,

93
00:04:45,477 --> 00:04:47,273
so that there is no exuberance.

94
00:04:47,474 --> 00:04:49,054
So, to recreate that,

95
00:04:49,254 --> 00:04:51,600
you people have to

96
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:54,508
desire and ask for it,

97
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,608
and we’ll have people of that kind.

98
00:04:56,809 --> 00:04:58,475
It is just to be desired,

99
00:04:58,675 --> 00:05:00,797
and you all should desire for such things:

100
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:04,397
that people of exuberance should come forward

101
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:08,297
to value such things which are full of joy.

102
00:05:09,849 --> 00:05:11,317
May God bless you.
