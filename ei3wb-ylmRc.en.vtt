00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.400
is concerned with your mother

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.880

you want somebody to do something for

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.120
you twice

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.879
they want that somebody should need

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.480
or something you find somebody very

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.559
obsessed like i have

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.159
told you that you can beat them with you

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.760
simple way if you know how to do it

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.439
you see you just think of their

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:16.479
their heart and put a bandhan to that

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:20.000
and you can do it so beautifully

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:22.320
you can melt a person without any

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.360
difficulties if you know how to handle

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.560
their heart you have to appeal

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.360
to their heart and that's the best

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.880
attraction

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.079
at all and the best

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.560
secret method by which you can bring

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.200
good india when you are talking to

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.000
somebody

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.560
supposing i now intellectually if i

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.720
start

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.759
quarreling with you you'll give me up in

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.119
no time but

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.159
i have to use your power and i have to

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.759
enter into your

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.000
heart and that is how it works so always

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.159
when

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.759
you want to do something like that just

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.560
humble down yourself

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.399
in your heart that is first first of all

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.439
you must tumble down yourself in your

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.680
heart

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.600
and from there work on the heart of

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.959
others just put

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.920
a bundle and you will see a person will

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.360
melt away

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.760
we melt our intelligence our ego

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.560
everything even your superego in your

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.959
heart

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.239
so it's a very thing if you know how to

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.599
approach people

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:30.720
through their heart and

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:33.840
that is only possible if you are genuine

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.000
because genuineness is something that a

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.840
heart recognizes

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.040
you can be fool a person with your

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.599
cunning methods

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.640
but the heart will recognize it later

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.200
and the person will

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.160
hate you even if you talk to someone oh

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.920
very much very good thank you very much

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.160
and the heart knows so he's trying to

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.959
before me and he is very funny

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.840
the heart is going to hate such a person

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.239
and

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.959
heart has the utterance and feel the

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.959
person

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.800
so if you could appeal to somebody's

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.480
heart and put a bundle

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.120
on the heart you can melt that person

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.959
and if you love someone and if you want

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.840
that person should be corrected

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.200
supposing such a person is a drunkard or

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.599
a person who beats you

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.879
and is torturing you because he's under

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.040
the spell of

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.000
some drugs or some sort of a foreign

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.080
thing

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.120
then you just put bandhan to his heart

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.680
and you see

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.480
they'll be changing they'll be changing

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.480
very fast

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.760
and that's why you say change of heart

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.080
everywhere you find

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.920
in every scripture it is written change

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.959
of heart is needed not the change of

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.560
clothes

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.280
so it's not intellectual but a rational

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.360
change

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.720
but it is the change of heart and that

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.840
is brought about

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:53.120
by moving

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.239
the heart chakra on the right hand side

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.159
in the clockwise moment

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.040
that is the heart itself in the

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:04.640
clockwise mind if you can do that

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:08.159
you can really do marvels and that's how

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:12.840
on a collective basis the heart

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:16.720
is sort of the innermost innermost

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.560
string of the collective

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.759
one string that is passing through

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.759
alliance so

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.960
if you put strike at the innermost

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:25.520
because in

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.800
a three and a half circle that's the

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.160
innermost point

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.320
if you touch there it passes over this

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.680
supposing you touch somewhere else then

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.440
it might break

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.120
but at the beginning if you start

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.840
striking it it goes

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.440
very nicely and passes into complete

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.759
circumference

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.639
now the center one i have told you is

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:49.759
the

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.320
heart nexus which we call as cardiac

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.280
plexus

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.120
and it has got tens of plexuses and the

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.800
english names for that i will

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.160
again i'm going to give you the complete

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.120
list i don't know when will i have time

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.120
to go to the

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.560
medical journal but i'll find out all of

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.199
them and i'm going to tell you what they

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.400
call it

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:08.639
in the medical terminology but they know

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.639
that very there are tens of plexuses

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:11.360
which are supplying to the muscles of

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:13.600
the heart

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.800
to the lungs iron to the right side

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.120
lungs and

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.320
that's how we divide it but they do not

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.720
know that it is already

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.520
three parts and then there are 10 petals

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.360
which are working

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:28.639
down i'm sorry 12 30 saturn what moved

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:33.759
up so 3 divided into 12 is

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:36.639
4 each side but actually it is not true

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:36.639
it is uh

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.360
the ten petals are together in the

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.199
center

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:48.960
and the center one is known as the

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:50.639
sacred heart in the bible it is called

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:56.639
as sakura

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:56.639
and this the sacredness of that heart

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:03.600
in the abstract form is the

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:06.000
motherly love of god

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.120
that's why the the mother of the

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.479
universe decides

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:14.400
that and these those

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:15.360
12 petals act according to the mother of

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.280
the heart

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.560
and that's why we cannot allow them to

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.000
this side or that side

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.039
because it is he who actually makes them

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.240
pulsate

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:27.600
so here she becomes the dominant person

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.400
and not the heart they are the

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:33.440
spirituals so spirit has

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:37.520
rules by itself and it is ruled

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:40.720
with the help of the

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:44.080
reflection of god almighty himself

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:47.199
it is on its own it is arbit it sees

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.960
it watches it is the witness it watches

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:52.319
the play of these ten pet

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:55.440
twelve petals here but if it finds that

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:58.800
there's too much of stain on the

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:01.120
center one it just

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.880
switches off and when it's switched off

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.599
the whole thing

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.639
you see so you must understand the

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:09.759
difference between

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:13.199
the other other chakras and this one

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:16.400
is that there is a

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:19.840
pivot and the on the other side

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:23.039
third is a human

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:25.599
perfect personality

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:26.800
three things together now if you reduce

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:30.000
into our three powers

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:33.759
you'll understand on one side is

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:38.720
the instrument or you can say the

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:38.720
nucleus for the left hand side working

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.120
in the center it is or you can say left

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:44.720
hand side working you can say the

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.120
mahakali is working

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.720
in the center you can say it is for the

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:53.680
mahalakshmi working

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:57.520
and the nucleus for the working of the

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:59.360
right hand side is in the heart

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.120
on the right hand side where rama

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:04.080
recites because we can call it a

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:07.039
nucleophilicist he was active

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.759
he was active without feeling without

00:08:07.039 --> 00:08:12.800
feeling

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:15.599
they witnessed it now they combine here

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.039
where krishna came and he felt the

00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:19.520
witness state

00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:22.479
and he called it as diya is the whole

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:25.039
prayer brahma never called it as plain

00:08:22.479 --> 00:08:26.080
but he called it as play so that's why

00:08:25.039 --> 00:08:30.160
krishna here

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:33.919
is completed and that's why we call him

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.919
he's a complete incarnation

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:39.599
but now this coming back to the heart

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:42.959
again on the right hand side we have got

00:08:39.599 --> 00:08:46.240
rama's place now rama was known for

00:08:42.959 --> 00:08:48.800
his obedience to his father if you know

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:52.160
his story

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:54.240
his father was in

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.440
ahirtha he was there and he had three

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:59.279
wives

00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:02.320
the third wife had no

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:03.440
i mean he she had two sons but she could

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.880
not

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.880
see rama getting the throne

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.880
she was a very nice mother but somebody

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.720
you see some lady went and told

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.320
something to her and she listened to her

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.519
and she told

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:20.640
her husband that if you want

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:21.680
to give me my boon the promised boom you

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.800
have to

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:25.279
make rama go into the jungle for 14

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:30.399
years

00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:30.399
and give the throne to my son birth

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:39.519
and when the heard this he

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:40.720
he fainted he fainted with this request

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:43.360
but rama was there

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.720
he heard it and he immediately told her

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.800
that i'm going to

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.320
the forest and i've accepted it and your

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.839
point your son

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.519
has the bharat for me it's all right and

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:54.240
that's how he went you see

00:09:51.519 --> 00:09:55.600
just to obey the order of his father

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.000
because father had not even

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.360
ordered but because he was compelled he

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.240
had given his wife

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.519
two goons that once you see an award she

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.519
saved his life so she

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:07.040
he said that whenever you want you can

00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:09.120
ask for these two goals

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.800
and they were she she never knew that

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.720
she would use them in such a funny way

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.880
later on she repented because bharata

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.320
came and he refused to accept the throne

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.240
and he put only rama's

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:20.720
slippers there and ruled there and

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:23.600
everything was different but

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:25.440
died in because when rama went away he

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:28.399
just died

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.399
so you see

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:36.480
rama's life shows how he was obedient

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:39.360
to his parents he suffered so much

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.120
anyone who has not been respectful to

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:44.839
his parents

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:47.680
you see if your parents have been

00:10:44.839 --> 00:10:50.320
unkind

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.839
you have every right to tell them that

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:55.040
they should not be unkind to you

00:10:51.839 --> 00:10:58.560
and that you feel hurt but

00:10:55.040 --> 00:11:01.440
you have no business to answer them back

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.760
and you have to be respectful you have

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:07.200
to be respectful because they represent

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:09.440
your primordial parents you are not to

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.920
shout at them and misbehave

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.680
you have to be really respectful to them

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:16.160
they may be bad people

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.279
but you have to respect them because you

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.920
have chosen them

00:11:17.279 --> 00:11:21.920
when you were born you chose them you

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:24.640
could not have been born to them

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:27.120
you have really chosen them and you said

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:30.000
these are going to be my parents

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:32.000
so if they are your parents they are

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.839
there because of certain reasons

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.519
because you have been seeking them in

00:11:33.839 --> 00:11:37.200
their previous lives and that's how you

00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:39.519
are there

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.360
you are not to boss over them it's real

00:11:39.519 --> 00:11:44.320
i'm telling you the secret

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:46.079
it's not for anything for you see to

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.680
make you change your ways or anything

00:11:46.079 --> 00:11:49.360
but i'm just telling you the secret

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.639
because you have lost the idea of the

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:54.240
secretive methods

00:11:50.639 --> 00:11:56.160
of winning over people and understanding

00:11:54.240 --> 00:12:00.320
them and managing them and

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.320
really you will have your way only thing

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.600
is
