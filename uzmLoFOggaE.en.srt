1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,690
So we’ll have the experience now.

2
00:00:05,727 --> 00:00:07,533
It will take about five minutes

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,150
for you because if all the chakras are discussed

4
00:00:10,192 --> 00:00:12,444
already the attention is on that.

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,021
Is very simple to put your hands towards Me.

6
00:00:17,061 --> 00:00:21,301
Sahaja Yogi : Everyone steps out his shoes, will you ?

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,026
Shri Mataji : It’s better.

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,137
[to the Sahaja Yogi] You’ve done a good job Ah

9
00:00:33,215 --> 00:00:36,224
Just put your hands towards Me.

10
00:00:36,738 --> 00:00:39,152
Just like this.

11
00:00:39,241 --> 00:00:43,121
[Shri Mataji takes vibrations of the audience]

12
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:57,148
Left.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,119
Now, left hand towards Me and right hand towards the Mother Earth.

14
00:01:11,175 --> 00:01:14,558
We’ll give you a balance. You need not close your eyes just now, let’s see.

15
00:01:14,606 --> 00:01:18,560
Put your right hand towards the Mother Earth.

16
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:23,346
As I told you yesterday left side is our conditioning,

17
00:01:23,446 --> 00:01:26,486
conditioning, subconscious and collective subconscious,

18
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:28,909
very much at work here.

19
00:01:28,974 --> 00:01:33,093
But also is an emotional side.

20
00:01:43,716 --> 00:01:49,236
Now put your right hand towards Me and left hand towards the sky.

21
00:01:49,755 --> 00:01:53,355
Right hand towards Me, right hand towards Me like this.

22
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:57,517
Sahaja Yogi : Put your left hand towards the back.

23
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,890
Shri Mataji : Are you feeling the cool breeze in the hand?

24
00:02:14,604 --> 00:02:17,600
You are already thoughtless, there’s no thought,

25
00:02:17,683 --> 00:02:21,746
but just see if you are feeling the cool breeze.

26
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,040
Sahaja Yogi : It’s better [inaudible].

27
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,520
Shri Mataji : Much better

28
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,471
Are you?

29
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:34,667
Let’s see.

30
00:02:35,034 --> 00:02:41,834
[Shri Mataji blows in the mike].

31
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,490
All right?

32
00:03:41,758 --> 00:03:45,403
Are you feeling any cool breeze in the hand?

33
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:50,383
All right, now put your left hand on top of your head,

34
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:53,329
just here,

35
00:03:53,508 --> 00:03:55,964
fontanel bone area.

36
00:03:56,898 --> 00:03:59,167
Are you feeling?

37
00:03:59,346 --> 00:04:01,678
It’s a very subtle thing.

38
00:04:03,913 --> 00:04:05,913
Are you?

39
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,289
Pay attention.

40
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,550
Shri Mataji : [to the Sahaja Yogi]. Working out ; good?

41
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,040
All right. Now, change over.

42
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,500
See the left hand, with the right hand. Just pay attention there, see.

43
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,310
Believe that you are the Spirit.

44
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,157
So just you have to say in your heart: “I am the Spirit”.

45
00:04:35,204 --> 00:04:38,974
In your heart. Say it seven times, it will work out.

46
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,706
Releasing.

47
00:04:53,971 --> 00:04:56,441
Is it all right?

48
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,266
Are you feeling the heat coming out?

49
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,750
Little heat.

50
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,710
All right, now turn, change, see now.

51
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:11,004
Right Swadhishthan.

52
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,740
All right?

53
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,980
Sahaja Yogi : Right Swadhishthan

54
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,980
Shri Mataji : Left [UNCLEAR]

55
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,625
[Shri Mataji washes her hands with water].

56
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:28,144
Now, just see, if it is working cool breeze…

57
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,780
[Shri Mataji blows in her hands].

58
00:05:33,008 --> 00:05:37,149
Feel it. Just put your hands like this.

59
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,112
It’s good.

60
00:05:51,514 --> 00:05:55,834
You are all thoughtless. If you see, there’s no thought in your mind.

61
00:05:59,314 --> 00:06:01,594
And complete silence.

62
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,074
Enjoy this.

63
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:10,740
This moment is going to transform your life, take it from Me.

64
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:17,690
You may not realize today but you’ll realize it very soon.

65
00:06:19,702 --> 00:06:24,262
Ah, strong.

66
00:06:25,424 --> 00:06:28,824
Have faith in yourself, that’s the main thing.

67
00:06:32,984 --> 00:06:35,754
It’s beautiful.
