00:02.920 --> 00:06.947
But first of all, people do not understand that
you have to work it

00:07.027 --> 00:09.710
through your heart and not\hthrough your brain.

00:09.826 --> 00:14.057
When we have to work out
things through our brain, we try to develop\h\hour brain,

00:14.236 --> 00:15.764
isn’t it?

00:15.844 --> 00:19.265
By memorizing, by practising\hsomething,

00:19.345 --> 00:23.280
teaching our brain how to think, how to go this way that way.

00:23.660 --> 00:25.685
We try to train our brain.

00:25.765 --> 00:29.084
Now, we have to train our heart in Sahaja Yoga.

00:29.740 --> 00:33.052
And to train our heart in Sahaja Yoga,

00:33.602 --> 00:35.761
one has to\hknow, first of all,

00:35.848 --> 00:41.500
that it is enveloped either by ego or by superego.

00:41.919 --> 00:45.309
The limbic
area actually represents the heart.

00:46.789 --> 00:53.319
And if there is ego, heart will always be
so-called,

00:53.500 --> 00:57.513
it will not be the real heart that\hwill be working, but it’s only mental,

00:57.593 --> 00:58.987
mental\hprojection.

00:59.221 --> 01:02.040
And you will feel that, “I’m doing\h\hit from my heart.”

01:02.120 --> 01:03.682
But it’s not true.

01:04.451 --> 01:08.281
Now then,\hsupposing,
what should we do if we have ego?

01:09.381 --> 01:14.318
You might say, you should try to sort of tell yourself
that, "That’s not good and this and that

01:14.500 --> 01:18.532
and all\hkinds of mental suggestions"

01:18.677 --> 01:20.668
or autosuggestions\hor this –

01:20.748 --> 01:24.368
the way psychiatrists know that give you suggestions.

01:24.830 --> 01:27.595
That’s again mental.

01:27.812 --> 01:30.656
So,\hthat’s not the way it is going to work out.

01:31.720 --> 01:35.016
We must understand that for that what we have to
do is to

01:35.096 --> 01:37.507
raise the left side and put it to the right side.

01:37.588 --> 01:39.294
There’s no other way out.

01:39.381 --> 01:43.256
You have to just work it out with your hands, your hands are working it out

01:43.336 --> 01:47.747
and not your brain.\hSo use your hands

01:47.921 --> 01:49.963
and the methods of Sahaja Yoga.

01:50.043 --> 01:57.484
Now, everyone must have a regular sitting
in the water

01:57.564 --> 01:59.732
every day, that’s important.

02:00.100 --> 02:03.830
Every morning you must do your meditation.

02:03.910 --> 02:09.807
You have to know that Sahaja Yoga is to
be worked out, it‘s not to be thought out.

02:11.090 --> 02:16.842
You just cannot think about it. Whatever
you may try to do through your thought,

02:17.082 --> 02:21.842
you cannot achieve any results in Sahaja Yoga. You\hhave to use your hands, you have to use your feet,

02:22.120 --> 02:26.500
\h\hyou have to soak your feet in the water because
water is the ocean.

02:26.585 --> 02:31.856
All these five chakras – or,\h\hsay, six chakras

02:32.387 --> 02:35.979
which are — I say five
because the…

02:36.106 --> 02:40.748
one is the Mooladhara Chakra, which is the seven

02:40.828 --> 02:44.636
and the topmost is the brain.

02:45.630 --> 02:48.887
So, in between five chakras which
are there —

02:48.967 --> 02:51.587
are to be handled fully

02:51.667 --> 02:57.735
with the\hidea that they are basically made of matter.

03:00.032 --> 03:03.632
And these five elements constitute

03:05.008 --> 03:08.370
the body of these chakras.

03:09.314 --> 03:13.523
Now, these chakras, if\hthey are to be corrected,

03:13.603 --> 03:19.232
we have to correct them by taking out all the problems of these chakras

03:19.312 --> 03:23.860
into the elements from which they’re coming.

03:24.238 --> 03:29.364
For example, a person who is
a very right-sided person,

03:30.837 --> 03:34.436
so, he has to give a balance by the left-side.

03:35.698 --> 03:40.397
Of course, raising with the hand is
all right. But what about the element?

03:40.732 --> 03:45.680
Right-sided person has all the elements\hwhich give heat:

03:45.905 --> 03:47.842
we can say, the light,

03:48.068 --> 03:50.596
we can say, the fire.

03:50.676 --> 03:53.989
So, for people who are\hright-sided,

03:54.200 --> 03:57.429
the light is not going to help much.

03:58.822 --> 04:04.077
Like, if you put the light before the photograph,
and those who are ego-oriented people

04:04.317 --> 04:07.582
— if you just use the light, it’s not going to work out.

04:07.892 --> 04:11.581
So, what is going to work out is the Mother Earth

04:11.715 --> 04:17.568
and the water element, which is cooling.

04:17.963 --> 04:23.975
Even ice\his very helpful to people who are right-sided.

04:25.982 --> 04:36.798
So, all cooling effects should be used
for correcting your right-sidedness,

04:37.336 --> 04:39.345
so that you cool it down.

04:39.486 --> 04:41.228
Same about food.

04:41.726 --> 04:47.577
In food, those who are right-sided people should
take to foods

04:47.657 --> 04:52.834
which are left-sided, that is carbohydrates, means they should become partly\hvegetarians,

04:52.914 --> 04:55.665
or quite a lot of vegetarians.

04:56.736 --> 05:01.251
And should eat things at the most like chicken,

05:01.505 --> 05:06.842
but\hnot fishes, not seafoods because they are all hot.

05:07.067 --> 05:12.766
That’s how you treat your material side of your
chakras.

05:12.949 --> 05:17.195
Now, the left-sided people should use, again,

05:17.294 --> 05:20.450
the "deepam" is the light or the fire

05:20.614 --> 05:24.788
to\hcorrect their left-side.

05:25.154 --> 05:31.651
Also, in food such people should take more to nitrogenous, means protein

05:31.949 --> 05:36.953
and\hfoods like that. They should take more proteins.

05:37.727 --> 05:43.230
Now, as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

05:43.385 --> 05:46.388
the basic\hthing is Kundalini.

05:46.543 --> 05:52.621
And the Kundalini, as I have told you, is the pure desire.

05:52.825 --> 05:57.425
Again, listen\hto it carefully: pure desire.

05:57.650 --> 06:01.050
That means all other desires are impure.

06:01.206 --> 06:03.100
There’s only one pure\hdesire.

06:03.180 --> 06:06.362
And that is to be one with the Divine,

06:06.527 --> 06:11.981
one with the Brahma, one with God — that’s the
only pure desire.

06:12.531 --> 06:15.888
All other desires are impure.
