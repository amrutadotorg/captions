WEBVTT

05:00.434 --> 05:04.020
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

05:11.785 --> 05:14.527
At the very outset we have to know

05:14.708 --> 05:16.832
that Truth is what it is.

05:22.660 --> 05:26.012
We can not change it,

05:26.395 --> 05:29.817
we can not describe it,

05:30.326 --> 05:34.287
and unfortunately at this humane awareness

05:34.467 --> 05:36.255
we can not know it.

05:52.439 --> 05:55.921
Whatever I’m trying to tell you here

05:56.001 --> 05:58.953
you should not take it to blindfolded.

06:06.748 --> 06:08.154
The blind faith

06:08.179 --> 06:11.483
has created lots of problems for us.

06:15.297 --> 06:16.871
But you must keep

06:17.188 --> 06:20.242
your mind open

06:20.799 --> 06:22.961
like a scientist.

06:28.678 --> 06:31.040
And if it is proved,

06:31.095 --> 06:34.657
than you have to accept it as honest people.

06:39.913 --> 06:43.319
Because it is for your good,

06:46.366 --> 06:48.850
for the benevolence of your country,

06:50.819 --> 06:54.789
and for the benevolence of the whole world.

06:58.188 --> 07:00.580
In the evolutionary process

07:00.776 --> 07:02.944
we have reached up to the point

07:03.218 --> 07:06.785
where we can called as humane beings.

07:15.234 --> 07:17.922
But we have not reached

07:18.634 --> 07:21.141
our highestly goal

07:25.711 --> 07:29.170
because we do not know the Absolute Truth..

07:32.170 --> 07:35.037
What we know is relative truth*

07:38.521 --> 07:39.794
And so*

07:39.819 --> 07:43.045
there are difference of opinions.*

07:48.179 --> 07:50.695
And we will argue, fight*

07:50.720 --> 07:52.569
also have wars.*

07:56.421 --> 07:59.585
If everybody knows the same truth,*

07:59.610 --> 08:02.086
how can there be any fights.*

08:08.148 --> 08:11.179
Become the spirit,*

08:11.204 --> 08:15.504
it's the only way to have known the absolute truth.*

08:21.240 --> 08:23.678
The truth about you is that

08:23.717 --> 08:26.591
you are not this body, this mind,

08:27.030 --> 08:30.030
this intellect, these emotions.

08:40.255 --> 08:44.452
Also you are not these conditionings and

08:44.966 --> 08:46.397
this ego.

08:50.628 --> 08:54.313
You say, “My intellect, my

08:55.187 --> 08:58.915
emotions, my body”.

08:59.016 --> 09:01.286
It’s all “my”. Who is this “Me”?

09:07.912 --> 09:10.404
So this is

09:10.429 --> 09:13.033
what is going to happen now

09:13.058 --> 09:16.304
that you have to become the Spirit.

09:22.101 --> 09:24.501
Because you are the Spirit.

09:27.553 --> 09:30.003
The second great

09:30.059 --> 09:32.976
Truth is that you see these flowers;

09:33.016 --> 09:36.136
they are all miracles of beautiful garden.

09:45.593 --> 09:48.843
We take them for granted; we don’t even wonder how

09:48.868 --> 09:52.208
they have been created by this Mother Earth.

09:58.139 --> 10:00.384
Who does this work?

10:02.386 --> 10:04.357
Who runs our heart?

10:06.151 --> 10:10.251
If you ask a doctors, they’ll say, “It is autonomous nervous system”.

10:15.302 --> 10:17.271
But who is this “Auto”?

10:19.826 --> 10:22.890
So we have to understand that there is

10:22.915 --> 10:25.757
some Power, which does this.

10:31.021 --> 10:33.868
This Power is the All Pervading

10:33.893 --> 10:36.860
Power of Divine Love.

10:43.115 --> 10:45.858
In Koran they call it “Ruh”.

10:48.452 --> 10:51.187
And in the Bible they call it as

10:51.212 --> 10:54.843
the “cool breeze of the Holy Ghost”.

10:59.724 --> 11:02.497
Indian Scriptures it is called

11:02.654 --> 11:05.700
as “Param Chaitanya”.

11:11.082 --> 11:13.816
Patanjali has called as

11:13.841 --> 11:15.847
“Rutam Bhara PrAgnya”.

11:19.316 --> 11:21.675
Whatever name you may call It,

11:24.746 --> 11:27.839
but It exists all the time

11:27.887 --> 11:30.042
into every

11:30.224 --> 11:32.738
part and parcel of Creation.

11:40.586 --> 11:43.211
And does all the living work.

11:45.352 --> 11:47.851
We can not explain the living work.

11:49.919 --> 11:53.441
As you know science is very limited.

11:55.902 --> 11:58.863
It can not say why are you on this Earth.

12:01.894 --> 12:04.346
What is the purpose of your life.

12:06.340 --> 12:08.401
What is your identity.

12:11.924 --> 12:14.257
Also it is immoral.

12:16.428 --> 12:19.616
Out of science people have created

12:19.678 --> 12:23.614
atom bombs and all kinds of things

12:28.989 --> 12:31.212
without any discrimination.

12:33.291 --> 12:35.532
You too have here

12:36.058 --> 12:38.535
this disaster – Chernobyl.

12:42.310 --> 12:46.200
All this is because of unlimited

12:46.254 --> 12:48.334
movement of science.

12:54.936 --> 12:58.827
So then what should we do?

13:02.085 --> 13:04.059
Within us lies

13:05.372 --> 13:08.930
a power, which we call as Kundalini.

13:14.165 --> 13:15.961
As it is shown there

13:15.986 --> 13:19.775
it is in the triangular bone called as sacrum.

13:26.032 --> 13:29.651
That means the Greeks knew it is a sacred bone.

13:35.495 --> 13:38.672
This Kundalini is the reflection

13:38.697 --> 13:40.690
of the Holy Ghost.

13:45.617 --> 13:47.187
Very surprisingly

13:47.212 --> 13:50.572
there is no mention of the Primordial Mother.

13:56.264 --> 13:59.303
We have got Father – the God,

13:59.438 --> 14:02.861
Son – the God, but no Mother.

14:06.729 --> 14:08.850
They call Her Holy Ghost.

14:11.436 --> 14:13.903
This Kundalini is the reflection

14:13.928 --> 14:17.083
of that Primordial Mother within you.

14:23.200 --> 14:27.177
She seated there to give you your second birth.

14:31.616 --> 14:33.765
She’s your own Mother.

14:36.055 --> 14:40.954
And she is anxious to give you your second birth.

14:45.008 --> 14:46.654
In Sanskrit language

14:46.679 --> 14:50.443
an enlightened soul is called as dvijaha.

14:55.590 --> 14:58.637
Means “born twice”, “twice born”.

15:02.403 --> 15:05.656
Also the birds are called as dvijaha.

15:08.540 --> 15:11.623
Because they are first

15:12.031 --> 15:16.499
born as eggs and then they become the birds.

15:23.128 --> 15:27.300
In the same way a humane being is born as a humane being

15:27.325 --> 15:30.932
and then he becomes an enlightened soul.

15:38.379 --> 15:39.908
This bird

15:40.966 --> 15:43.901
is very different from the egg.

15:47.706 --> 15:50.612
In the same way an enlightened soul

15:50.637 --> 15:54.630
is very different from this humane state.

16:01.585 --> 16:05.480
So it is very important for us

16:05.505 --> 16:08.742
to become the enlightened ones.

16:15.467 --> 16:18.493
Christ was a pure logos

16:18.518 --> 16:20.803
what you call “the first sound”.

16:26.927 --> 16:28.751
We call it omkara.

16:30.931 --> 16:34.494
He was too pure to understand humane beings.

16:38.596 --> 16:42.684
And what He has said in the fifth chapter

16:43.143 --> 16:48.041
Mathew that, “If you eye does anything wrong,

16:48.066 --> 16:49.682
then take it out”.

16:58.052 --> 17:01.631
“If your hand does anything wrong, cut it out”.

17:04.882 --> 17:09.594
“If somebody slaps you on this side, you give the another side”.

17:14.383 --> 17:17.070
This is very difficult for humane beings.

17:18.907 --> 17:21.751
I think most of the people, in the West specially,

17:21.776 --> 17:24.153
would be without eyes, without hands.

17:30.231 --> 17:33.161
Because they have no value for morality.

17:37.068 --> 17:40.532
But He has said that you have to be born again.

17:44.041 --> 17:48.231
So some people brand themselves as “born again”.

17:54.075 --> 17:57.107
You may be a Christian, Hindu, Muslim, anything,

17:57.132 --> 17:59.083
you can commit any sin.

18:06.990 --> 18:10.979
Also this “born again” the same style, it’s just a brand.

18:17.229 --> 18:19.214
There is no transformation.

18:24.324 --> 18:29.191
Mohammed Sahib came afterwards and he thought,

18:29.216 --> 18:33.323
“Christ has been very strict with men”.

18:40.337 --> 18:42.398
So He got the Shariat

18:42.532 --> 18:46.618
which was given by Moses to Jews, for the Muslims.

18:58.945 --> 19:03.742
Now, imagine this Shariat is so horrible

19:03.767 --> 19:06.855
that if you steal anything, you cut your hands.

19:13.450 --> 19:16.201
If you abuse anybody, you cut your tongue.

19:19.717 --> 19:23.829
I think most of the Americans will be without tongues.

19:27.399 --> 19:30.158
Because at every sentence they abuse.

19:35.221 --> 19:37.126
But Mohammed Sahib

19:37.205 --> 19:40.165
gave this Shariat to the Muslims.

19:45.322 --> 19:47.431
And thought that the

19:48.799 --> 19:51.597
Shariat is very strong on men,

19:51.622 --> 19:53.596
so He also

19:53.621 --> 19:56.728
have brought some strictness for women.

20:04.064 --> 20:06.455
Both Mohammed Sahib and Christ

20:06.480 --> 20:09.243
were different people, absolutely

20:09.268 --> 20:12.752
above our grasp.

20:19.901 --> 20:22.670
It’s very difficult to follow Them.

20:25.280 --> 20:29.052
So you have to be enlightened soul if you want to follow Them.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.523
This is what Sahaja Yoga is.

20:41.219 --> 20:43.508
That your Kundalini awakens

20:43.533 --> 20:46.977
and starts passing through six centers

20:47.002 --> 20:51.837
and comes out of your fontanel bone area

21:04.817 --> 21:08.676
and connects you to the this All Pervading Power

21:08.701 --> 21:10.475
of Divine Love.

21:16.231 --> 21:18.645
We have so far used only

21:18.670 --> 21:20.762
the power of hatred,

21:24.722 --> 21:26.840
never of pure love.

21:29.489 --> 21:33.937
Love, which is devoid of greed

21:35.180 --> 21:39.078
or any kind of expectation.

21:48.183 --> 21:50.879
Pure love without any lust.

21:54.254 --> 21:56.129
And this is the power,

21:56.154 --> 22:00.358
which is doing all the beautiful things for us.

22:04.913 --> 22:07.944
So first thing that happens to you that you start

22:07.969 --> 22:10.991
feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost

22:11.016 --> 22:14.565
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

22:23.019 --> 22:25.542
This is the actualization

22:25.567 --> 22:29.401
of baptism.

22:33.281 --> 22:36.464
It is not just some priest put some water

22:36.489 --> 22:39.081
and says, “Now you are a Christian”

22:39.106 --> 22:43.051
or a Muslim says, “Now you have become a Muslim”, is not like that.

22:51.447 --> 22:54.123
It is an actualization,

22:54.267 --> 22:56.315
it’s a happening within you.

23:01.142 --> 23:03.699
So when this Kundalini rises

23:04.004 --> 23:07.974
she passes through these six centers.

23:12.702 --> 23:14.969
All the problems of the world

23:14.994 --> 23:17.648
are mostly because of humane beings.

23:21.493 --> 23:24.500
And most of the humane problems

23:24.525 --> 23:28.020
are because of these centers

23:32.770 --> 23:36.522
because they are for our physical, mental,

23:36.547 --> 23:38.849
emotional and spiritual being.

23:48.442 --> 23:52.192
So when the Kundalini passes through these six centers

23:52.217 --> 23:55.848
she enlightens them, she integrates them,

23:55.873 --> 23:58.775
and also she nourishes them.

24:07.258 --> 24:10.764
Thus many diseases are cured.

24:14.405 --> 24:17.764
Mentally, mental diseases are cured also.

24:23.241 --> 24:26.413
Even financial problems improved.

24:29.460 --> 24:31.671
Emotional problems.

24:34.820 --> 24:38.304
And the person becomes extremely dynamic

24:38.329 --> 24:41.855
as well as extremely compassionate.

24:47.879 --> 24:51.261
We have many musicians in India

24:51.348 --> 24:54.504
who were not so good when they came to Sahaja Yoga

24:54.529 --> 24:56.677
and today they are world famous.

25:07.465 --> 25:09.832
This is nothing,

25:09.857 --> 25:12.098
there are so many things happen

25:12.317 --> 25:16.802
that people who have never been orators become orators,

25:16.827 --> 25:19.083
poets, writers.

25:19.108 --> 25:22.523
All kinds of potential

25:23.047 --> 25:25.898
capacities start manifesting.

25:39.827 --> 25:41.954
We are all the time thinking

25:41.979 --> 25:46.236
and the thoughts rise and fall, rise and fall.

25:50.924 --> 25:53.948
They either come from the past or from the future.

25:57.332 --> 26:01.232
So we are jumping in the past or in the future all the time.

26:04.875 --> 26:08.021
But if I say, “Be in your present”, you can not.

26:11.545 --> 26:15.690
But when the Kundalini rises she elongates those thoughts

26:20.839 --> 26:24.104
and sets the little space in between, which is the present,

26:24.129 --> 26:25.770
which expands.

26:32.372 --> 26:35.950
And you become thoughtlessly aware.

26:39.232 --> 26:43.189
You aware, but absolutely thoughtless.

26:47.385 --> 26:48.623
Then

26:50.187 --> 26:52.656
inspirations start coming.

26:55.925 --> 26:58.089
And you don’t know from where they come.

27:03.546 --> 27:08.101
We have six centers

27:08.477 --> 27:12.634
and they go into jeopardy

27:12.760 --> 27:15.145
because of our

27:15.373 --> 27:18.252
maybe wrong decisions.

27:25.981 --> 27:29.514
But the lowest center is for our innocence.

27:34.077 --> 27:38.357
Our innocence can never be destroyed because it is eternal.

27:42.381 --> 27:45.876
Only it can be covered with some clouds.

27:48.915 --> 27:51.575
But with the awakening of the Kundalini

27:51.600 --> 27:54.773
the innocence comes back to us.

27:58.866 --> 28:02.768
Our attention becomes absolutely innocent

28:06.472 --> 28:09.700
and there is no lust and greed in our attention.

28:13.981 --> 28:18.265
It is very subtle that we can feel

28:18.290 --> 28:21.689
the center, our own centers on our fingertips.

28:28.407 --> 28:31.962
And whenever we put our attention on anyone

28:31.987 --> 28:35.238
we can feel his centers also.

28:42.684 --> 28:44.651
Because who is the other?

28:46.862 --> 28:50.022
The microcosm has become the macrocosm.

28:53.726 --> 28:56.089
A drop has become the ocean.

28:58.371 --> 29:00.732
You become a global personality

29:04.106 --> 29:07.856
and then you talk the language of centers.

29:12.304 --> 29:15.278
You transit all the limitations

29:15.303 --> 29:18.366
of racialism, nationalism,

29:18.391 --> 29:20.317
all kinds of -isms.

29:29.527 --> 29:32.385
Your attention becomes innocent

29:34.660 --> 29:38.375
and it acts, whenever you put your attention it works.

29:47.601 --> 29:51.169
Above all you know the absolute truth.

29:55.771 --> 29:59.378
On your fingertips you can know the absolute truth.

30:03.598 --> 30:05.711
Many people don’t believe in God.

30:05.736 --> 30:08.858
They can ask a question, “Is there a God?”

30:13.296 --> 30:15.148
And immediately they get start

30:15.173 --> 30:17.837
feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost on their hands

30:17.862 --> 30:19.267
because that’s the truth.

30:25.673 --> 30:28.294
Christ was the Son of God, no doubt.

30:30.092 --> 30:33.881
So you can ask the question, “Was He the Son of God?”

30:33.906 --> 30:37.594
and immediately you start getting cool breeze on your fingertips.

30:45.598 --> 30:49.111
Now if you know how to correct your centers,

30:49.136 --> 30:53.287
you can correct your centers because you get the Self-knowledge.

31:02.685 --> 31:05.222
And also you get the knowledge about others.

31:07.628 --> 31:09.750
You can cure others also.

31:11.626 --> 31:15.704
When you become thoughtlessly aware, you become absolutely peaceful.

31:21.799 --> 31:23.799
You become very dynamic,

31:25.926 --> 31:28.003
but you feel very young.

31:30.988 --> 31:34.990
I’m about seventy-two years of age now running -

31:39.444 --> 31:42.754
And every day I’m traveling, every day practically.

31:45.488 --> 31:47.426
I don’t think I am traveling.

31:49.084 --> 31:51.801
I’m sitting everywhere and that’s what I feel.

31:55.348 --> 31:59.263
In the same way you all drop your age

31:59.288 --> 32:02.668
and become much younger and happier.

32:09.516 --> 32:11.562
You become so peaceful

32:13.351 --> 32:17.352
and wherever you go you manifest peace and joy.

32:21.340 --> 32:24.586
Above all you jump in the sea of joy.

32:29.266 --> 32:31.877
Joy is the singular thing.

32:34.510 --> 32:36.663
But happiness and unhappiness

32:36.688 --> 32:39.519
are the two sides of a coin.

32:44.106 --> 32:46.622
If your ego is pampered you feel happy,

32:46.647 --> 32:49.035
if it is punchered you’ll feel unhappy.

32:57.745 --> 32:59.752
But joy is singular.

33:01.764 --> 33:05.757
You become the witness and see everything as a drama

33:09.671 --> 33:13.795
and really you swim in the ocean of joy.

33:18.749 --> 33:21.537
Thus you enter into the Kingdom of God.

33:24.506 --> 33:26.506
This is the Last Judgment,

33:27.730 --> 33:29.797
it is for you to decide whether

33:29.822 --> 33:32.387
you want to enter into the Kingdom of God

33:32.412 --> 33:34.763
or you want to destroy yourself.

33:41.412 --> 33:45.746
And then you are surprised how blissful everything becomes.

33:50.316 --> 33:52.708
You are protected all the time.

33:54.451 --> 33:56.509
No mafia can trouble you.

33:58.729 --> 34:02.349
All mafia people will be destroyed

34:02.374 --> 34:05.574
when we’ll have lots of Sahaja Yogis here.

34:10.167 --> 34:12.566
It has happened in Italy,

34:12.958 --> 34:16.770
the mafia of Italy is completely destroyed.

34:22.193 --> 34:25.631
And sixty percent dishonest people,

34:25.656 --> 34:29.524
politicians and others are in jail.

34:37.364 --> 34:40.927
This happens when the Divine Power works.

34:45.091 --> 34:48.606
I’m happy to see you all in such good health.

34:52.802 --> 34:55.279
First time when I had come there were

34:55.304 --> 34:57.694
so many patients of Chernobyl.

35:04.108 --> 35:07.796
And last year there was a negative force of this

35:07.821 --> 35:10.420
“White Order”.

35:17.036 --> 35:21.208
All such forces are now destroyed practically, everything.

35:25.545 --> 35:28.016
But one thing I would like to warn you:

35:30.976 --> 35:33.681
the Western culture is coming,

35:36.128 --> 35:38.971
is the most dangerous thing you can think of.

35:44.629 --> 35:48.815
First of all you have to become absolutely stupid people.

35:53.792 --> 35:58.515
Like there is an actress who married eight times in America.

36:02.406 --> 36:05.163
And thousands of people went to see

36:05.188 --> 36:08.156
her going for her honeymoon

36:08.181 --> 36:12.407
with her twenty-five younger husband.

36:25.231 --> 36:27.731
And there were ten helicopters

36:27.912 --> 36:31.058
hovering around her house

36:31.223 --> 36:34.844
and they were parachuting down with their cameras.

36:43.461 --> 36:45.750
So many of them fell on the tree,

36:45.775 --> 36:48.344
some fell on the people.

36:53.285 --> 36:56.035
Such stupid things they are teaching.

36:58.176 --> 37:01.021
They have only two hundred year old people.

37:08.350 --> 37:11.967
There is one fellow – Simpson, who murdered his wife,

37:11.992 --> 37:14.749
so now they are saying you should not have marriages,

37:14.882 --> 37:17.273
because people murder wives.

37:25.342 --> 37:29.303
They followed this stupid Freud for years together

37:33.530 --> 37:37.204
where he said that there is a bad relationship between

37:37.229 --> 37:39.125
a son and the mother.

37:44.537 --> 37:47.154
There’s no wisdom, they have no wisdom,

37:47.179 --> 37:49.356
they are not mature at all.

37:53.246 --> 37:55.142
They are good at making money

37:55.167 --> 37:58.824
and also because they have a country,

37:58.849 --> 38:02.261
which has lots of things.

38:10.519 --> 38:14.113
But they are now in recession, all over,

38:14.138 --> 38:16.820
everywhere in Europe they are in recession.

38:22.025 --> 38:24.969
And they are exporting all their junk

38:25.088 --> 38:26.931
to your country.

38:31.213 --> 38:33.769
And they get so much of your money.

38:36.973 --> 38:39.513
They make you absolutely poor.

38:41.733 --> 38:43.557
Like in Turkey

38:44.082 --> 38:48.318
people were so much under the influence of German television

38:54.391 --> 38:57.172
and they started taking all German things,

38:57.197 --> 39:00.354
buying all German things, even the food.

39:07.948 --> 39:10.538
They felt an inferiority complex.

39:13.695 --> 39:15.586
But they are great artists;

39:15.611 --> 39:19.009
I don’t know how these people impressed

39:19.034 --> 39:22.405
such matured, wise people.

39:30.936 --> 39:34.280
As a result that country has become very poor.

39:37.773 --> 39:41.156
They are also selling here lot of junk.

39:44.383 --> 39:46.641
And even in Russia

39:46.666 --> 39:50.989
they are having shops and shops of this junk.

39:56.529 --> 39:59.579
In India you can’t find one shop

39:59.604 --> 40:02.677
with imported things, not even one shop.

40:10.496 --> 40:12.277
Only those who go abroad

40:12.302 --> 40:15.480
can bring some things, very little.

40:21.241 --> 40:23.647
So you should not, really,

40:23.672 --> 40:26.111
buy anything from these shops.

40:30.586 --> 40:33.453
Because these things are throwing away.

40:37.582 --> 40:39.433
They have over-production

40:39.458 --> 40:42.856
and they don’t know what to do with it, it can not fetch any money.

40:49.672 --> 40:51.782
Also this modern music

40:51.807 --> 40:53.994
is very bad for the brain.

40:54.019 --> 40:57.521
The doctors have said, everybody said but nobody listens.

40:57.546 --> 40:59.699
Now they have got intoxicated.

41:11.035 --> 41:13.497
But you people are wise,

41:13.935 --> 41:15.435
take to wisdom.

41:19.781 --> 41:21.985
Not that stupid fashions.

41:24.111 --> 41:26.558
Specially women have to be very careful.

41:30.075 --> 41:33.201
They started a fashion of

41:33.226 --> 41:35.278
exposing all the legs

41:35.303 --> 41:37.733
with the six inches of skirt.

41:48.425 --> 41:50.484
And all of them,

41:50.665 --> 41:54.602
all those women got varicose veins,

41:54.627 --> 41:57.805
pains, arthritis, all kinds of diseases.

42:05.234 --> 42:06.875
Then the fashion came

42:06.900 --> 42:10.124
where they had long skirts but open.

42:15.140 --> 42:19.424
In such cold countries why do the stupid things like this?

42:24.643 --> 42:28.104
But you people have lots of wisdom,

42:28.129 --> 42:31.099
now don’t lose it. Specially the women.

42:31.124 --> 42:33.743
You have to preserve this country.

42:41.348 --> 42:43.699
And not to make yourself cheap.

42:47.054 --> 42:49.728
Women who are cheap are never respected.

42:55.472 --> 42:58.097
I am really worried about this point

42:58.122 --> 43:01.489
that if you start taking to Western culture

43:01.514 --> 43:04.272
you’ll be completely lost nation.

43:15.873 --> 43:20.046
We have experience of this in India.

43:23.625 --> 43:26.436
And Mahatma Gandhi started a movement

43:26.461 --> 43:29.010
that nothing from abroad we’ll buy.

43:35.682 --> 43:37.963
And the British who have ruled us for

43:37.988 --> 43:40.261
three hundred years had to go back.

43:45.291 --> 43:48.754
So please I would request you all

43:48.779 --> 43:53.173
not to take to this junk and used.

44:03.183 --> 44:06.164
I’m so thankful to you for your love

44:06.352 --> 44:08.141
and for your kindness.

44:12.712 --> 44:15.196
People of

44:16.229 --> 44:17.844
not only Kyiv,

44:17.869 --> 44:21.699
but the whole of Ukraine are extremely lovable.

44:28.792 --> 44:32.050
I don’t know how to express Myself,

44:32.075 --> 44:33.722
because I have Myself

44:33.747 --> 44:36.572
become like an ocean of love.

44:43.391 --> 44:46.607
I hope all of you get your Realization tonight.

44:51.569 --> 44:54.367
It is your freedom I respect.

44:57.461 --> 45:02.294
If you don’t want to have your Realization, you may go.

45:06.103 --> 45:07.911
I can not force on you.

45:09.763 --> 45:12.256
As I told you this is the Last Judgment.

45:15.138 --> 45:18.263
Mohammed Sahib has said, “When Kiyama will come,

45:18.288 --> 45:21.599
– means when the Resurrection time will come,

45:21.624 --> 45:23.795
–then your hands will speak

45:31.275 --> 45:34.502
and they will give evidence against you”,

45:34.527 --> 45:38.139
means they’ll tell you what centers are wrong in you.

45:46.911 --> 45:50.990
So this process is only for ten minutes

45:51.121 --> 45:54.446
that you will feel this cool breeze,

45:54.627 --> 45:58.104
but those who do not want, should leave the hall.

46:13.356 --> 46:16.015
It is spontaneous, it is Sahaj.

46:19.078 --> 46:21.937
“Saha” means “with”, “ja” is “born”.

46:28.593 --> 46:32.515
It is born with you, this right to have this Yoga,

46:32.540 --> 46:35.425
means the union with the Divine Power.

46:40.645 --> 46:42.572
You can not pay for it.

46:45.244 --> 46:47.050
This is one should understand

46:47.075 --> 46:50.638
that you can not pay for your spiritual life.

46:55.630 --> 46:57.866
You can pay for this hall,

46:57.977 --> 47:00.780
maybe for the carpets,

47:00.805 --> 47:03.930
but you can’t pay for Divine Love.

47:11.031 --> 47:12.894
We have no organization.

47:15.278 --> 47:17.831
There are sixty-five nations

47:17.902 --> 47:19.551
where we have Sahaja Yoga.

47:23.269 --> 47:27.721
Specially in Russia in a place called place Togliatti

47:27.734 --> 47:31.216
we have more than twenty one thousands Sahaja Yogis.

47:38.302 --> 47:40.059
I have no secretary,

47:40.084 --> 47:43.564
nothing; it is all working so well

47:46.815 --> 47:49.307
because coming from your heart.

47:54.338 --> 47:56.226
So I would request all of you

47:56.251 --> 47:58.798
to put your hands like this towards Me.

48:04.589 --> 48:06.026
Just higher.

48:12.366 --> 48:13.623
All right.

48:14.116 --> 48:17.533
Now you have

48:17.674 --> 48:21.368
to bend your head and put your right hand

48:21.393 --> 48:24.472
on top of the fontanel bone area

48:24.497 --> 48:27.710
and see if there’s a cool or a hot breeze

48:27.735 --> 48:29.826
coming out of your head.

48:41.890 --> 48:43.851
You have to forgive everyone.

48:45.446 --> 48:49.298
Also you have to forgive yourself, you are not to feel guilty at all.

48:53.872 --> 48:56.512
At this moment you are not to

48:57.169 --> 49:00.811
say anything about others or about yourself.

49:06.604 --> 49:08.479
No confessions.

49:09.667 --> 49:10.815
All right?

49:11.444 --> 49:15.166
If it is hot, that means you have not yet forgiven.

49:20.043 --> 49:24.668
Now put the right hand towards Me and now bend your head again

49:24.693 --> 49:29.494
and see for yourself if there’s a cool or a hot breeze coming out.

49:39.050 --> 49:41.503
Now again with the left hand you try,

49:41.528 --> 49:43.755
bend your head and see for yourself

49:44.208 --> 49:46.529
if there’s a hot or a cool

49:46.554 --> 49:50.771
breeze like vibrations are coming out of your head.

50:04.753 --> 50:08.035
Now please put both the hands towards the sky like this

50:08.060 --> 50:11.215
and ask one of these questions.

50:18.878 --> 50:21.401
You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji.

50:24.620 --> 50:27.359
Now please ask a question,

50:27.437 --> 50:30.234
“Mother, is this

50:30.390 --> 50:32.570
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

50:38.508 --> 50:41.186
Ask in your heart three times.

50:44.804 --> 50:47.101
Or else ask three times,

50:47.126 --> 50:51.631
“Mother, is this the All Pervading Power of Divine Love?”

51:01.658 --> 51:04.282
Or else you can ask three times,

51:04.307 --> 51:07.063
“Mother, is this the Parama Chaitanya?”

51:13.300 --> 51:15.167
Now please take down your hands.

51:19.622 --> 51:22.450
Please put your hands like this towards Me,

51:26.012 --> 51:28.247
look at Me and don’t think,

51:30.700 --> 51:32.700
look at Me and don’t think.

51:35.768 --> 51:36.948
Now,

51:40.347 --> 51:42.902
please those who have got

51:42.927 --> 51:46.999
cool breeze in the palm or on the fingertips

51:47.024 --> 51:51.028
or out of the fontanel bone area,

51:51.397 --> 51:55.733
cool or hot *breeze*, please raise both your hands.

52:11.768 --> 52:15.018
That is Kyiv, I tell you. All of you.

52:15.043 --> 52:18.103
May God bless you. Your hands are shining.

52:18.287 --> 52:21.068
May God bless you. May God bless you.

52:34.437 --> 52:37.179
I bow to you, I bow to you,

52:37.663 --> 52:40.749
now you have started your saintly life.

52:46.625 --> 52:48.837
Now you have to grow.

52:50.798 --> 52:53.549
For that you have to come to our centers.

52:56.261 --> 52:58.190
You don’t have to pay anything.

53:00.387 --> 53:04.668
But you will know everything about yourself within yourself.

53:08.004 --> 53:10.467
Within one month you’ll become masters.

53:13.656 --> 53:15.863
You can give Realization to others.

53:19.223 --> 53:22.193
You can raise their Kundalini

53:22.218 --> 53:25.366
and also you can cure people.

53:29.922 --> 53:31.922
In the center they will tell you

53:31.947 --> 53:35.380
how to meditate for ten minutes every evening.

53:41.590 --> 53:43.970
All your problems will be solved.

53:46.540 --> 53:49.449
Is the Divine Force that will work it out.

53:54.631 --> 53:56.624
I bless you from My heart.

53:59.781 --> 54:03.862
I’ll again come next year and I’ll hope to see you all

54:03.887 --> 54:06.580
grown up much bigger than this.

54:16.016 --> 54:17.593
Thank you very much.

54:50.709 --> 54:52.409
They have to clap.

55:01.505 --> 55:03.537
And now enjoy your Self.

01:00:53.147 --> 01:00:55.451
What have you got my child?*
