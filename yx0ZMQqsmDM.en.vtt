00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:17.265
So, this last center,

00:00:17.465 --> 00:00:27.586
 the Sahastrara, is contained in the limbic area of the brain.

00:00:34.483 --> 00:00:40.408
Our head is like a coconut.

00:00:40.608 --> 00:00:47.471
The coconut has the hair, and then a hard nut

00:00:47.671 --> 00:00:51.555
and then a black covering

00:00:51.755 --> 00:01:01.358
and inside is white shell

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.668
of coconut and inside is the space, the water.

00:01:08.123 --> 00:01:12.494
In the same way, our brain is made.

00:01:12.694 --> 00:01:16.963
That's why coconut is called as Shreephala.

00:01:17.163 --> 00:01:28.277
Is the fruit of the power that is Shree.

00:01:28.477 --> 00:01:34.980
Shree power is the right side power

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.847
and the left side power is the Lalita power.

00:01:40.047 --> 00:01:45.605
So, we have two Chakras - left side, here, is the Lalita

00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:52.503
and right side, here, is the Shree Chakra.

00:01:52.703 --> 00:01:59.144
These two Chakras are working out

00:01:59.344 --> 00:02:02.605
the right side Mahasaraswati's power

00:02:02.805 --> 00:02:07.945
and left side Mahakali's powers.

00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:16.660
Now, the central power is the Kundalini.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.629
That has to rise and penetrate through different Chakras,

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:31.949
enter into the limbic area and enlighten the seven Pithas -

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:36.012
seats of these seven Chakras.

00:02:36.212 --> 00:02:39.575
So, it penetrates through six Chakras,

00:02:39.775 --> 00:02:45.950
enters into the limbic area,

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:54.556
enlightens all the seven Pithas in the brain,

00:02:54.756 --> 00:03:01.001
which are placed along the mid-line of the limbic area.

00:03:01.201 --> 00:03:05.329
So, we start it from the back, is placed here,

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:09.977
at the back, is the Mooladhara Chakra.

00:03:10.177 --> 00:03:16.625
Around it is the Swadishthana,

00:03:16.825 --> 00:03:21.977
then is the Nabhi, then the Heart,

00:03:22.177 --> 00:03:26.735
then the Vishuddhi and then the Agnya.

00:03:26.935 --> 00:03:33.258
So, all these six centers are combining

00:03:33.458 --> 00:03:37.024
to make the seventh center.

00:03:37.224 --> 00:03:41.454
This is a very important point, which we should know.

00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:45.226
Now, the Shree Chakra is the right side working

00:03:45.427 --> 00:03:49.515
and the Lalita Chakra is the left side working.

00:03:49.716 --> 00:03:55.953
So, when the Kundalini doesn't rise

00:03:56.154 --> 00:04:01.508
then we do with our right side

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.258
our physical and mental activities.

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.992
So our brain is doing right side activity

00:04:09.193 --> 00:04:14.560
and that's why our brain is like Shreephala.

00:04:19.208 --> 00:04:23.812
Sahastrara is actually

00:04:24.013 --> 00:04:30.289
is the assemblage of these six Chakras

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.023
and is a hollow space,

00:04:33.224 --> 00:04:37.820
on the sides of it there are one thousand Nadis.

00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:44.414
And when the light penetrates into the limbic area,

00:04:44.615 --> 00:04:52.593
then the enlightenment of these Nadis take place

00:04:52.794 --> 00:04:56.241
and you can see them as flames,

00:04:56.442 --> 00:05:00.327
very gentle flames burning

00:05:00.528 --> 00:05:04.140
and these flames have all the seven colors

00:05:04.341 --> 00:05:09.864
that you see in the vibjyor.

00:05:11.333 --> 00:05:16.702
But the last one, ultimately becomes again integrated

00:05:16.903 --> 00:05:19.890
and it is a crystal clear flame.

00:05:20.091 --> 00:05:27.122
All these seven lights ultimately become crystal clear.

00:05:27.876 --> 00:05:32.952
So, you have Sahastrara with one thousand petals,

00:05:33.153 --> 00:05:35.874
as they called it,

00:05:36.075 --> 00:05:41.913
but if you cut the brain in a transverse section

00:05:42.114 --> 00:05:46.483
or horizontal section, you will be able to see

00:05:46.684 --> 00:05:51.819
that all these nerves are built like this

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.546
along the limbic area, all of them are like a petal,

00:05:56.747 --> 00:06:02.288
and if you cut it like this, you will find that

00:06:02.489 --> 00:06:10.051
there are many nerves in every bundle of nerves.

00:06:11.357 --> 00:06:13.744
So, when it is enlightened,

00:06:13.945 --> 00:06:27.780
you can see Sahastrara as a burning bundle of flames.
