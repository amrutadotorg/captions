00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:43.959
First three minutes are without sound.

00:02:56.667 --> 00:03:01.667
But as I told you there could be good conditionings.

00:03:01.875 --> 00:03:06.959
In the way, in the same way, you can have good habits

00:03:07.125 --> 00:03:10.417
If habits inhibit

00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:14.333
or obstruct your ascent,

00:03:16.166 --> 00:03:22.083
they also can help to stabilize you.

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:33.375
The conditioning comes to you from the matter

00:03:33.792 --> 00:03:37.083
with which we are dealing every day.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.417
When a human being sees the matter, he aggresses it

00:03:43.667 --> 00:03:48.291
and he wants to use that matter for his own purpose.

00:03:48.834 --> 00:03:53.375
He changes the forms of the matter for his own purpose.

00:03:53.875 --> 00:03:57.166
He starts getting used to matter

00:03:58.792 --> 00:04:04.875
as comfort, or as a help or a guide in life.

00:04:06.375 --> 00:04:09.291
The more you start depending on matter,

00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:12.750
the more your spontaneity is finished,

00:04:13.041 --> 00:04:16.792
because you’re dealing with the dead.

00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:23.041
Matter, when it is dead, then only we deal with it.

00:04:23.375 --> 00:04:28.041
When it is living we are not so much bothered about it.

00:04:28.458 --> 00:04:33.333
So the deadness of that matter settles within us

00:04:33.542 --> 00:04:39.291
when we start using that matter for our purpose.

00:04:39.917 --> 00:04:44.500
But how are we to otherwise exist, is the question people can ask.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.917
If God has given us this material things and this matter to be used,

00:04:49.208 --> 00:04:51.999
are we not supposed to use them?

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:57.709
And are we not supposed to enjoy them?

00:04:58.375 --> 00:05:02.000
But we don’t enjoy really..

00:05:02.417 --> 00:05:06.375
Before realization you cannot enjoy any matter.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.333
You can only form a habit

00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:14.750
and may become a slave of that matter, before realization.

00:05:15.083 --> 00:05:19.959
It’s a principle of, fundamental principle of economics

00:05:20.333 --> 00:05:23.709
that wants in general are never satiable.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.083
Means today you want to buy something like a carpet.

00:05:27.375 --> 00:05:29.250
All right, you bought it.

00:05:29.458 --> 00:05:32.999
So now that carpet becomes a headache,

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:36.500
because it’s your possession, you have to look after it.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.583
You have to insure it, you have to worry about it

00:05:39.792 --> 00:05:43.500
that it doesn’t get spoiled, first of all.

00:05:44.041 --> 00:05:46.375
And secondly you really get

00:05:46.792 --> 00:05:50.208
into another mood of buying something else.

00:05:50.834 --> 00:05:53.041
Now you have bought the carpet, finished.

00:05:53.792 --> 00:05:55.125
Then you have to have something else,

00:05:55.333 --> 00:05:57.875
then you have to have s.th. else, then you have to have s.th. else.

00:05:58.041 --> 00:06:02.792
So it does not satiate you; it does not give you the joy.

00:06:04.709 --> 00:06:07.083
Matter can never give you joy.

00:06:07.417 --> 00:06:10.041
It’s the Spirit that gives you joy.

00:06:11.375 --> 00:06:13.083
And when the ascent takes place,

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.583
when you become the Spirit, then matter takes

00:06:17.917 --> 00:06:19.999
another value system within ourselves;

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.959
the value system of matter is very different.

00:06:25.834 --> 00:06:27.875
As I’m sure Jason must have told you

00:06:28.291 --> 00:06:30.041
that when you get your realization,

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:34.458
then you start feeling the cool breeze in the hand.

00:06:38.041 --> 00:06:39.750
In relationship to matter

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.500
it’s very helpful to be a realized soul,

00:06:44.166 --> 00:06:48.417
because immediately you know

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:52.417
what is good for you and what is bad for you.

00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:56.792
For example, you eat something that’s not good for you:

00:06:56.999 --> 00:06:59.959
Immediately you’ll lose your vibrations and will become hot.

00:07:00.417 --> 00:07:02.959
Even looking at it, it may happen.

00:07:03.375 --> 00:07:04.792
You want to sit on a chair

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:09.000
on which somebody who is a very wrong type of a person has sat,

00:07:09.458 --> 00:07:12.667
immediately you’ll feel, “Oh, something wrong in this place.”

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.625
With your vibrations, which is a definite thing, an absolute thing.

00:07:20.792 --> 00:07:23.875
And this conditioning can only be over –

00:07:24.083 --> 00:07:27.834
these habits can be overcome only if you become the Spirit,

00:07:28.083 --> 00:07:33.000
because Spirit is always dominated by the matter.

00:07:33.417 --> 00:07:37.999
And the Spirit has to overcome that domination of the matter.

00:07:39.667 --> 00:07:43.250
Actually, Spirit cannot be dominated by anything.

00:07:43.709 --> 00:07:46.125
But what I mean is that it is covered,

00:07:46.458 --> 00:07:51.083
like the sun can be covered with clouds.

00:07:51.667 --> 00:07:55.000
In the same way all our domination,

00:07:55.417 --> 00:08:02.041
or we can say all our enslavement of the matter,

00:08:02.417 --> 00:08:05.417
makes us dominate our Spirit in the sense that

00:08:05.625 --> 00:08:06.625
we cover it up.

00:08:06.959 --> 00:08:09.667
The clouds are there, we can’t see the Spirit. We can’t feel it.

00:08:09.875 --> 00:08:13.291
The spontaneity which is the beauty of the Spirit

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.667
we do not feel in a person.

00:08:16.166 --> 00:08:18.542
So, in judging a person, what do we judge?

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:21.917
How that person looks, what dress he’s wearing,

00:08:22.166 --> 00:08:24.959
how he walks, what are his formal ways,

00:08:25.125 --> 00:08:27.792
does he know how to say “Thank you”, “Sorry” or not, you see?

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:29.999
All these things impress us very much.

00:08:30.041 --> 00:08:34.125
What sort of a car he has, what sort of a house.

00:08:34.583 --> 00:08:41.166
Maybe we may miss, we may miss a saint.

00:08:41.999 --> 00:08:43.959
We may miss Christ again

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.166
because He was a carpenter’s son.

00:08:47.709 --> 00:08:50.542
How are we to know who is Christ?

00:08:50.999 --> 00:08:55.792
Is there any way of finding out who is Christ?

00:08:56.291 --> 00:08:58.750
Many people are now talking “Christ is going to come,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.333
He’s going to come on the television.”

00:09:00.583 --> 00:09:03.917
You can put up anyone there as Christ.

00:09:04.375 --> 00:09:06.500
How are we going to make it out?

00:09:06.917 --> 00:09:09.583
By His dress or by some sort of a thing they have done?

00:09:10.041 --> 00:09:14.291
Most of the paintings of Christ and most of His statues

00:09:14.458 --> 00:09:16.500
that I’ve seen are no where near Christ,

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.375
no where near Christ, you see.

00:09:18.625 --> 00:09:22.041
They are horrid things. I don’t know what are they.

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:25.875
So how will you make it out that this is Christ or not?

00:09:26.166 --> 00:09:28.542
Or this is some sort of a hokus pokus fellow

00:09:28.667 --> 00:09:32.417
or some sort of a person who has come just deliberately

00:09:32.667 --> 00:09:35.999
to delude us from reality.

00:09:36.667 --> 00:09:41.208
There is no way out, to find out

00:09:41.959 --> 00:09:43.792
what is the truth because

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.583
we are so much used to material forms that we have.

00:09:47.834 --> 00:09:54.999
For example, our idea of art also is in the same way moulded.

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:58.000
We like this kind of art.

00:09:58.375 --> 00:09:59.709
If you ask them, “Why?”

00:09:59.959 --> 00:10:04.000
“Because, you know, this has this kind of a thing – harmony”,

00:10:04.333 --> 00:10:07.000
or maybe, “this is more proportioned” and all that.

00:10:07.375 --> 00:10:10.458
But how do you know?”

00:10:10.667 --> 00:10:13.458
You know because you’ve read certain books or maybe

00:10:13.792 --> 00:10:19.500
that you have understood from somebody else

00:10:19.959 --> 00:10:22.583
that this is art, this is beautiful.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.500
I mean, you brand something as beautiful, but is it really?

00:10:26.834 --> 00:10:29.166
If it is beauty, it should be Spirit,

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.625
because Spirit is beauty and beauty is Spirit.

00:10:32.917 --> 00:10:36.208
So is it, is it beauty? How do you make out

00:10:36.625 --> 00:10:40.166
that this art is beautiful or not?

00:10:40.333 --> 00:10:44.166
For example, according to all normal ideas of womanhood,

00:10:44.333 --> 00:10:47.375
I don’t think Mona Lisa is a beautiful woman.

00:10:47.875 --> 00:10:50.792
I mean the way these days you see mosquito-like women

00:10:50.999 --> 00:10:52.417
are regarded as beautiful.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.959
So how they call Mona Lisa so beautiful?

00:10:55.333 --> 00:10:57.208
What’s in her?

00:10:57.834 --> 00:11:00.458
Thousands of people would be assembled to see that painting

00:11:00.583 --> 00:11:02.999
Why? What has that?

00:11:03.417 --> 00:11:07.500
Only vibrations will tell you that it emits vibrations.

00:11:07.959 --> 00:11:10.417
It appeals to your Spirit without your knowledge.

00:11:10.583 --> 00:11:13.166
You’re not aware of it. It appeals to your Spirit.

00:11:13.333 --> 00:11:18.709
That’s why universally that painting is appreciated.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.041
But when this conditioning becomes collective,

00:11:22.583 --> 00:11:25.583
any such conditioning becomes collective and you accept

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:29.250
“This is the form that is beauty;

00:11:29.333 --> 00:11:31.250
this is the form that is reality;

00:11:31.458 --> 00:11:35.166
this is the form that is spontaneity”,

00:11:35.417 --> 00:11:38.083
then the confusion starts.

00:11:38.542 --> 00:11:41.375
The confusion starts at that point,

00:11:41.583 --> 00:11:43.875
when it becomes a collective thing.

00:11:45.125 --> 00:11:47.875
For example I met some people of some gurus.

00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:50.709
When I asked them,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.333
“What makes you think that your guru is truthful,

00:11:53.542 --> 00:11:54.709
what has he given?

00:11:54.999 --> 00:11:58.792
He said, “Because sitting in my chair I just start jumping by myself.

00:11:58.999 --> 00:12:03.792
I don’t do it but it happens, it’s spontaneous.”

00:12:04.208 --> 00:12:08.291
And in My presence, the way his body was moving was so horrifying.

00:12:08.542 --> 00:12:11.709
Anybody would have tremendous compassion

00:12:12.208 --> 00:12:13.917
and concern for such a person,

00:12:14.083 --> 00:12:15.709
that you can’t sit for five minutes straight …

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.834
Woman: Excuse me, it wasn’t spontaneous, it was nervousness.

00:12:20.125 --> 00:12:21.792
Yes, that’s what I’m saying …

00:12:22.083 --> 00:12:24.250
Woman: You’re very wrong in what You talk.

00:12:24.542 --> 00:12:25.125
What?

00:12:25.333 --> 00:12:27.125
Woman: About everything.

00:12:27.417 --> 00:12:29.375
From where do you come?

00:12:29.375 --> 00:12:30.417
Woman: Up the road.

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:32.458
That’s it. Better go.

00:12:33.166 --> 00:12:35.417
Woman: Don’t worry. I am.

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:40.625
Look at that. She’ll go to the pub now.

00:12:43.917 --> 00:12:46.375
Must try to understand the subtleties, you see?

00:12:46.709 --> 00:12:48.166
If you are confirmed with what -

00:12:48.417 --> 00:12:51.583
Now supposing somebody starts jumping in the thing

00:12:51.917 --> 00:12:54.208
and he say's, - as she says it’s true, nerves,

00:12:54.625 --> 00:12:58.500
that means you’re not in control of your nerves, isn’t it?

00:12:58.709 --> 00:13:00.333
Don’t you think so?

00:13:00.709 --> 00:13:02.750
You’re not in control, you have not controlled.

00:13:02.999 --> 00:13:07.834
Spontaneity is a thing which is not the thing that makes you a slave.

00:13:08.083 --> 00:13:09.709
This is the point I’m trying to bring.

00:13:10.291 --> 00:13:13.583
It doesn’t! It makes you a master.

00:13:13.625 --> 00:13:15.583
Spontaneity must make you a master

00:13:15.875 --> 00:13:17.959
and not a slave of anything.

00:13:18.458 --> 00:13:22.917
She must have come from TM because TM people jump like that.

00:13:23.542 --> 00:13:25.583
And they end up as epileptic people.

00:13:26.083 --> 00:13:27.583
I have cured so many of them.

00:13:27.792 --> 00:13:29.999
I don’t know if someone has come from there.

00:13:30.375 --> 00:13:36.959
Even the head of their academy in Scotland,

00:13:37.083 --> 00:13:39.667
the flying squad academy, as I call it,

00:13:40.166 --> 00:13:43.792
where people pay three thousand – now this gentleman sitting here

00:13:43.959 --> 00:13:45.709
is one of them who suffered.

00:13:45.917 --> 00:13:48.875
When they suffer then they know what it is.

00:13:49.959 --> 00:13:53.041
The other day we saw somebody with epilepsy of such frequency.

00:13:53.125 --> 00:13:57.875
The poor child, he was hardly twenty-six years of age,

00:13:58.041 --> 00:14:00.417
young man, supposed to enjoy his life,

00:14:00.667 --> 00:14:06.250
was going into such trauma, you can’t imagine.

00:14:07.667 --> 00:14:11.625
And if this is happening to somebody going to a guru, you paid for it,

00:14:11.917 --> 00:14:14.417
how can it be anywhere near Spirit?

00:14:14.917 --> 00:14:17.333
This is what I’m trying to tell you,

00:14:17.625 --> 00:14:22.750
that Spirit gives you spontaneity in which you are the master.

00:14:23.208 --> 00:14:28.166
You are the master of yourself, complete master,

00:14:28.333 --> 00:14:31.709
no enslavement of any kind, no habits formation coming.

00:14:31.959 --> 00:14:33.041
All habits drop out.

00:14:33.458 --> 00:14:36.792
You become so, so spontaneous that I don’t have to tell you.

00:14:36.999 --> 00:14:41.375
You just drop out all habits and you become a master of your self.

00:14:41.959 --> 00:14:44.083
That should happen to you.

00:14:44.709 --> 00:14:49.375
Instead of that, if you indulge into things which enslave you,

00:14:49.667 --> 00:14:53.542
you will like it for a while because you can’t help it.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.667
But if really sit down,

00:14:55.875 --> 00:14:58.500
you will know that it’s not the thing that you wanted.

00:14:58.875 --> 00:15:00.834
You wanted to be the master of yourself.

00:15:01.291 --> 00:15:04.959
Now here in this map as we show we have two powers,

00:15:05.208 --> 00:15:06.792
left and right powers.

00:15:06.999 --> 00:15:10.999
The left power is the power that gives us conditioning –

00:15:11.291 --> 00:15:13.999
left side, the subconscious, the collective subconscious.

00:15:14.542 --> 00:15:16.709
That gives us the conditioning.

00:15:17.041 --> 00:15:19.375
Now, if you try to deny all that,

00:15:19.542 --> 00:15:21.709
then the right side is even worse.

00:15:21.999 --> 00:15:26.959
It gives us action, but with action we can become very ego oriented.

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.792
So both ways it can be troublesome.

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:32.250
Supposing you say that “All right,

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.208
I have no conditioning of any kind.

00:15:34.417 --> 00:15:37.041
What’s wrong in doing this? What’s wrong in doing that?”

00:15:37.583 --> 00:15:42.375
And if you just move with that idea, with that freedom,

00:15:42.625 --> 00:15:45.083
it will be abandonment, it may not be freedom.

00:15:45.458 --> 00:15:48.375
Because freedom must have wisdom behind it.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.417
So both the sides, the movements on both the sides are wrong.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.750
So what is all right, In the center?

00:15:58.375 --> 00:16:01.542
Is not to get conditioned by anything

00:16:01.999 --> 00:16:05.417
and not to be ego oriented.

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:07.583
But how to do it is the problem.

00:16:07.999 --> 00:16:09.834
The problem is how to do it.

00:16:10.125 --> 00:16:16.583
To be spontaneous is to be absolutely free.

00:16:16.959 --> 00:16:19.333
Now I would consider these two powers as say,

00:16:19.583 --> 00:16:23.375
a brake and an accelerator in a car.

00:16:23.999 --> 00:16:25.500
Now you use both the powers.

00:16:25.709 --> 00:16:28.375
You use the brake first, you use the accelerator.

00:16:28.583 --> 00:16:31.166
You try to control these two powers.

00:16:31.417 --> 00:16:34.041
But, first of all it is difficult to understand

00:16:34.291 --> 00:16:35.834
how you can use these powers.

00:16:36.083 --> 00:16:37.792
Gradually, with practice you’ll do it.

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:42.999
You know how to drive the car, you become the good driver.

00:16:43.083 --> 00:16:45.083
After becoming the good driver,

00:16:45.291 --> 00:16:48.333
still you are not the master of the driving.

00:16:48.875 --> 00:16:51.083
But then you become the master.

00:16:51.792 --> 00:16:56.041
So, today the master within us, within us is the Spirit.

00:16:56.542 --> 00:17:00.208
But before realization, we are not the master

00:17:00.625 --> 00:17:05.208
because the master has not come in our conscious mind.

00:17:05.709 --> 00:17:07.999
It is not expressing in our conscious mind.

00:17:08.291 --> 00:17:15.583
In the sense that we are not empowered by its powers.

00:17:16.125 --> 00:17:18.834
The Spirit exists; It has Its own powers.

00:17:19.083 --> 00:17:22.417
But we haven’t felt those powers within us.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.417
Once we feel the powers of the Spirit,

00:17:25.667 --> 00:17:30.125
we are empowered by our own powers which are there.

00:17:30.542 --> 00:17:33.333
The powers are within us.

00:17:33.709 --> 00:17:35.250
These are our own powers.

00:17:35.542 --> 00:17:38.208
We don’t have to borrow from anyone, ask from anyone,

00:17:38.583 --> 00:17:39.792
they are in ourselves.

00:17:40.041 --> 00:17:41.291
The Spirit is within us –

00:17:41.583 --> 00:17:46.417
only thing that Spirit has to give light in our,

00:17:47.041 --> 00:17:50.000
in our consciousness.

00:17:50.458 --> 00:17:52.792
It has to come in our consciousness.

00:17:53.166 --> 00:17:56.959
In simple medical terminology we can see, say,

00:17:57.208 --> 00:18:04.208
that the Spirit must manifest Itself in our central nervous system,

00:18:04.542 --> 00:18:06.834
in our central nervous system,

00:18:07.083 --> 00:18:09.083
so that we should know what we are doing.

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:12.917
Not that we start just jumping on the,

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:17.250
on the chair, or some people said, “Oh, we just start doing it.”

00:18:17.542 --> 00:18:19.709
It is hypnosis.

00:18:20.208 --> 00:18:22.500
It’s not correct. You are not in conscious mind.

00:18:22.792 --> 00:18:24.750
You are doing it out of hypnosis.

00:18:25.166 --> 00:18:28.250
Hypnosis may be coming from outside force.

00:18:28.709 --> 00:18:31.999
It’s not your force, your awareness,

00:18:31.999 --> 00:18:34.083
your understanding, your power.

00:18:34.417 --> 00:18:38.625
It is somebody else’s because you’re not doing it.

00:18:40.083 --> 00:18:44.458
As matter has a power to overpower us, in the same way

00:18:44.792 --> 00:18:47.458
there are some material things, I should say,

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:50.417
which are very dangerous, which are placed.

00:18:50.625 --> 00:18:53.041
For example now cancer, take cancer,

00:18:53.333 --> 00:18:54.999
cancer overpowers you.

00:18:54.999 --> 00:18:56.542
It’s a very serious thing.

00:18:56.792 --> 00:18:59.166
Cancer overpowers you; you cannot overpower cancer.

00:18:59.542 --> 00:19:01.083
Take a very concrete example.

00:19:01.458 --> 00:19:03.208
Now how is it caused?

00:19:03.458 --> 00:19:05.417
Doctors say this way, that way.

00:19:05.959 --> 00:19:08.250
We, Sahaja Yoga can cure cancer, definitely,

00:19:08.625 --> 00:19:10.542
hundred percent it can cure, it has cured.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:12.333
Many Sahaja Yogis have cured cancer.

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:14.999
How? Is very simple.

00:19:15.333 --> 00:19:19.125
That you become master of yourself and you master the disease also.

00:19:19.375 --> 00:19:22.000
You master everything.

00:19:24.709 --> 00:19:26.542
Because the master is within you,

00:19:26.834 --> 00:19:28.792
it has not come in your conscious mind

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.458
is the only link is left,

00:19:30.667 --> 00:19:34.500
and when that happens Yoga takes place, union takes place.

00:19:34.875 --> 00:19:38.291
We should now completely keep ourselves

00:19:38.542 --> 00:19:43.959
limited to Self-realization, about God I’ll tell next time.

00:19:44.417 --> 00:19:50.458
Self-realization means to bring your Spirit into your conscious mind.

00:19:50.875 --> 00:19:54.250
Now how cancer is caused? Let’s see here what happens.

00:19:54.709 --> 00:19:57.709
It is caused by left-sided activity.

00:19:57.999 --> 00:20:02.542
Now left sided activities are emotional traumas,

00:20:02.917 --> 00:20:06.917
emotional problems, emotional upheavals,

00:20:07.166 --> 00:20:09.166
emotional insecurities –

00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:12.959
any kind of insecurity can take you to the left side.

00:20:13.291 --> 00:20:16.166
Little more movement can be these horrible gurus

00:20:16.458 --> 00:20:17.417
because they hypnotize you.

00:20:17.667 --> 00:20:19.041
They put you to the left.

00:20:19.917 --> 00:20:22.333
They put some Spirit in you or I don’t know what they do,

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.375
but they put you to the left.

00:20:24.625 --> 00:20:28.834
Any one of these activities which are not authorized by God,

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:31.000
taken to, you go to the left side,

00:20:31.417 --> 00:20:34.041
because you cannot ascend in the center.

00:20:34.208 --> 00:20:36.125
So either you go to the left or to the right.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.792
When you overdo these things, like black magic -

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:44.500
you have another thing here I’ve heard,

00:20:45.375 --> 00:20:47.625
some sort of a organization head -

00:20:47.999 --> 00:20:49.542
and the fellow you see, he used to -

00:20:49.834 --> 00:20:51.750
everything he saw moving in the house.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.834
He came to Sahaja Yoga and

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.875
his water jug was moving there and this was moving there

00:20:58.125 --> 00:21:00.041
and he couldn’t explain what was happening in his room.

00:21:00.333 --> 00:21:03.458
He was sitting down and he found something moving from here to here

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:05.834
It happens. What is that?

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:09.291
What is that doing this kind of a thing which you cannot control.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.542
Again we come to the same point –

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:13.375
something you cannot control.

00:21:13.417 --> 00:21:16.125
So you enter into the realm,

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:19.250
into the realm where you are controlled

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:21.792
and you are not under your own control.

00:21:21.959 --> 00:21:24.709
And that realm, when you enter in,

00:21:25.041 --> 00:21:27.834
I have always seen all the cancer patients

00:21:28.041 --> 00:21:30.959
are the ones affected by this.

00:21:32.041 --> 00:21:34.166
Most surprising.

00:21:35.041 --> 00:21:37.709
They are not aware; they do not know how they get into it.

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:40.999
For a lady, supposing, say she’s suffering

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:44.875
from an insecurity about her husband or maybe something,

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:48.792
or maybe she thinks that her husband may leave her any time.

00:21:48.999 --> 00:21:51.125
She loves him. Whatever it is.

00:21:51.625 --> 00:21:55.583
Such a woman might get a breast cancer,

00:21:55.917 --> 00:21:59.125
because the insecurities set in, in one of the centers there

00:21:59.417 --> 00:22:02.250
which you can see here, the center of the heart -

00:22:03.166 --> 00:22:05.291
Center Heart, as we call it.

00:22:05.458 --> 00:22:09.750
Now if this center goes out of order,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.041
if a woman feels insecure for anything whatsoever,

00:22:13.583 --> 00:22:16.792
she’s capable – she’s vulnerable to be attacked

00:22:17.041 --> 00:22:19.834
and she can get into cancer.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:23.583
So we have to understand life in totality,

00:22:23.709 --> 00:22:25.625
and not in one way.

00:22:26.041 --> 00:22:30.375
The total impact of life, the total effect of life,

00:22:30.542 --> 00:22:35.291
the total relationship with life must be understood.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:37.750
Now no doctor knows this.

00:22:38.166 --> 00:22:42.959
Will he know, when he treats the patient for, say breast cancer,

00:22:43.041 --> 00:22:47.583
will he know that this lady is insecured ?

00:22:48.625 --> 00:22:53.875
There’s another disease – anorexia – many girls suffer from it.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.542
They don’t just eat. They just give up eating.

00:22:57.709 --> 00:23:00.709
Now, you do not know why it happens.

00:23:00.999 --> 00:23:03.000
Doctors can’t cure it; nobody can cure it.

00:23:03.291 --> 00:23:04.542
What is the reason?

00:23:04.709 --> 00:23:08.959
The relationship of a girl, of a daughter with the father.

00:23:09.333 --> 00:23:12.834
Say father dies and the daughter doesn’t see the father,

00:23:13.125 --> 00:23:17.792
or she, in heart she loves the father but she doesn’t express it,

00:23:17.917 --> 00:23:21.000
or there’s some bad relationship that comes between

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:23.999
the father and the daughter,

00:23:24.291 --> 00:23:26.291
you get this trouble anorexia.

00:23:26.625 --> 00:23:31.583
You’ll be amazed but it is impossible for doctors to get –

00:23:31.834 --> 00:23:33.667
we have some doctors sitting here –

00:23:33.917 --> 00:23:39.333
it is impossible for any medical science to go near it.

00:23:40.875 --> 00:23:44.542
Because they do not see a human being in its totality.

00:23:44.917 --> 00:23:48.333
It’s a very delicate instrument God has created.

00:23:48.875 --> 00:23:50.583
The way we are harsh with others,

00:23:50.709 --> 00:23:56.041
the way we sometimes try to trouble others,

00:23:57.417 --> 00:24:03.500
try to make others feel insecured are unfair, unjust.

00:24:03.792 --> 00:24:09.875
Without our knowledge we really give them a tremendous insecurity.

00:24:09.917 --> 00:24:14.083
And such insecurities can work out

00:24:14.417 --> 00:24:18.792
incurable diseases of which we are not aware.

00:24:19.458 --> 00:24:23.000
So to understand the totality, what should happen to us?

00:24:23.709 --> 00:24:28.875
We should achieve that state where we can see the totality.

00:24:29.125 --> 00:24:32.125
Like if I have to see now, for example,

00:24:32.333 --> 00:24:35.875
the whole of Brighton, what should I do?

00:24:36.208 --> 00:24:39.458
I should go on a plane and see it from that height.

00:24:39.709 --> 00:24:40.959
I can see the whole.

00:24:41.166 --> 00:24:44.750
In the same way in your awareness, in your understanding,

00:24:44.999 --> 00:24:48.917
you should rise to that point from where you can see the whole.

00:24:50.417 --> 00:24:54.917
If you cannot see the whole, the partial vision,

00:24:54.999 --> 00:25:01.000
or we can say, a little that you see can create confusion,

00:25:01.625 --> 00:25:04.333
can create problems

00:25:04.417 --> 00:25:09.750
and some of them could be of a very, very serious nature.

00:25:10.417 --> 00:25:15.542
Because as human beings, we do not know what are we.

00:25:17.208 --> 00:25:20.999
This is the greatest problem of human beings,

00:25:21.291 --> 00:25:23.583
that they’ll say, “I don’t like it.”

00:25:23.917 --> 00:25:25.667
Now which one is this “I”?

00:25:25.959 --> 00:25:29.417
Is that your Spirit, or is that your ego?

00:25:29.917 --> 00:25:32.041
What is the part that is not liking it?

00:25:32.417 --> 00:25:34.208
Or is it your conditioning,

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:38.083
because you’re brought up in a particular way so you don’t like this?

00:25:38.667 --> 00:25:42.041
Which part of you is not liking it?

00:25:42.458 --> 00:25:46.166
And you’ll be amazed that it is not your Spirit.

00:25:46.667 --> 00:25:50.500
Because if Spirit likes, how will you know?

00:25:51.125 --> 00:25:53.291
It’s only through your vibrations.

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:56.959
When you can feel the vibrations, then only you will say,

00:25:57.041 --> 00:25:58.625
“Yes, my Spirit likes it”,

00:25:58.917 --> 00:26:01.750
because the vibrations have emitted.

00:26:02.625 --> 00:26:06.375
So we are still in a transition state as human beings.

00:26:06.959 --> 00:26:10.333
We have not achieved that state which is called

00:26:10.542 --> 00:26:15.542
as the state of Self-realization where you become the Spirit -

00:26:15.917 --> 00:26:17.917
the becoming is the point.

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:22.417
Where you become the Spirit you know what you like.

00:26:22.959 --> 00:26:27.041
You really know what you really like,

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:29.458
because you are now the reality,

00:26:29.999 --> 00:26:32.375
you are not any conditioning,

00:26:32.792 --> 00:26:36.999
you are no more an ego but you are what you are really,

00:26:37.291 --> 00:26:39.000
and that is your Spirit.

00:26:39.458 --> 00:26:42.583
And surprisingly this Spirit is a collective being,

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:47.375
is no artificial collectivity within us,

00:26:47.542 --> 00:26:50.458
that also “All right, we belong to all Brighton so we are one"

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:53.999
or “We belong to one street so we are one.”

00:26:54.291 --> 00:26:57.333
It’s not like that, but is something that you are,

00:26:57.625 --> 00:27:00.166
absolutely you are a collective being!

00:27:00.458 --> 00:27:03.250
And you start feeling that collectivity within you

00:27:03.542 --> 00:27:05.999
with these different centers working it out.

00:27:06.625 --> 00:27:09.999
And you can feel it - others,

00:27:10.125 --> 00:27:13.417
you can feel others on your finger tips. Can you believe?

00:27:13.542 --> 00:27:18.041
In the Bible it’s written that your hands will speak.

00:27:18.375 --> 00:27:21.083
The description of these days is that your hands will speak.

00:27:21.417 --> 00:27:23.375
Why not people go and find out how does it happen?

00:27:23.542 --> 00:27:25.083
How can your hands speak?

00:27:25.291 --> 00:27:29.875
This is what happens that on your finger tips you start feeling

00:27:30.125 --> 00:27:32.917
and understanding what is reality,

00:27:33.125 --> 00:27:37.500
what is beauty, what is joy, what is love.

00:27:40.667 --> 00:27:44.999
This is the left side which we get,

00:27:45.166 --> 00:27:50.291
and ultimately with this left side problems we get physical pains.

00:27:50.625 --> 00:27:54.000
It’s very painful to have left sided problems –

00:27:54.417 --> 00:27:55.917
it’s very, very painful.

00:27:56.125 --> 00:27:59.959
The pain cannot be explained, no one can understand,

00:28:00.125 --> 00:28:03.375
nobody can cure it, you can’t tell anyone

00:28:03.583 --> 00:28:05.792
and people think that you are fussing,

00:28:05.792 --> 00:28:07.959
they give you psychological treatment.

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:11.417
You just don’t understand why this pain is within you.

00:28:11.792 --> 00:28:16.834
And this pain comes to you from left side, the subconscious.

00:28:17.125 --> 00:28:20.458
The beyond the subconscious is the collective subconscious,

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:24.375
and this collective subconscious is the one where,

00:28:24.875 --> 00:28:31.834
whatever is created from the beginning up to today

00:28:31.999 --> 00:28:34.625
in the creation is within you.

00:28:34.959 --> 00:28:38.959
And once you go to the subconscious, you just get lost there.

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:43.291
You are so overpowered by this power of subconscious

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:47.625
that it is beyond you to understand it,

00:28:48.083 --> 00:28:53.250
beyond you to get out of it and beyond you to –

00:28:53.542 --> 00:28:54.875
not to succumb to it.

00:28:55.166 --> 00:28:57.041
And it goes on increasing.

00:28:57.375 --> 00:29:00.375
Like I asked some people: “Why did you go on doing it

00:29:00.709 --> 00:29:03.166
when you knew that you were not doing it,

00:29:03.333 --> 00:29:06.458
somebody else was doing it? Still why did you continue to do it?”

00:29:06.834 --> 00:29:08.834
They said: “Mother, we were under the blanket,

00:29:09.083 --> 00:29:11.625
it was darkness, we didn’t know where we were moving

00:29:11.875 --> 00:29:14.875
and were just going on and on and on.”

00:29:15.041 --> 00:29:19.875
And as I told you last time, feeling guilty is the biggest blockade.

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:23.667
Is the biggest blockade because once you start feeling guilty

00:29:23.999 --> 00:29:28.291
that- this center on the left gets blocked and the –

00:29:28.999 --> 00:29:30.291
it’s very difficult.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.667
And you don’t know why you are feeling guilty.

00:29:33.166 --> 00:29:34.375
All the time you’re feeling guilty

00:29:34.583 --> 00:29:36.375
but you don’t know why you’re feeling guilty,

00:29:36.583 --> 00:29:39.458
why these ideas of guilt are coming to you,

00:29:39.583 --> 00:29:43.208
that this feeling of guilt keeps you away from joy,

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:47.834
from enjoying anything, from being spontaneous.

00:29:48.166 --> 00:29:53.166
Why? And this explains why

00:29:53.709 --> 00:29:56.542
we sometimes are miserable for nothing at all.

00:29:56.999 --> 00:30:00.166
Actually, God has not created us to be miserable.

00:30:00.583 --> 00:30:03.917
He has made us so beautifully, so carefully.

00:30:04.417 --> 00:30:08.583
He has created us with such love and compassion,

00:30:08.999 --> 00:30:12.417
not to make us feel miserable, not for anything.

00:30:12.542 --> 00:30:15.834
He doesn’t give us any diseases, no problems.

00:30:16.291 --> 00:30:18.709
But we have done these things to ourselves

00:30:18.959 --> 00:30:21.959
by going to extremes on the left or the right.

00:30:22.166 --> 00:30:24.542
As I am today talking about only on the left,

00:30:24.834 --> 00:30:28.208
I would say that to feel miserable for nothing at all

00:30:28.417 --> 00:30:32.834
is also wrong, is being unjust to yourself.

00:30:33.417 --> 00:30:35.250
The people who are left sided

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.750
must know that they are the Spirit,

00:30:38.959 --> 00:30:42.041
that they are that beauty which has to come,

00:30:42.333 --> 00:30:43.750
which has to express itself.

00:30:44.125 --> 00:30:48.000
That they are not the people who have to suffer

00:30:48.291 --> 00:30:51.709
all the time and to live like miserable people.

00:30:52.125 --> 00:30:53.458
They are not.

00:30:53.834 --> 00:30:56.625
But because they take so much upon themselves,

00:30:56.709 --> 00:30:59.875
bear so much upon themselves, they become like that.

00:31:00.458 --> 00:31:03.208
And to avoid that bearing up

00:31:03.333 --> 00:31:05.083
they may take to some other habits, you see.

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:06.750
Many people take to alcohol

00:31:06.875 --> 00:31:11.000
also for reason because they can’t bear the pangs of life,

00:31:11.208 --> 00:31:13.792
they can’t bear it. That’s why they take to it.

00:31:13.999 --> 00:31:16.583
But once the Spirit is awakened within you,

00:31:16.792 --> 00:31:20.792
you become so strong, you become so joyous,

00:31:21.041 --> 00:31:24.375
so spontaneous that all these things drop out,

00:31:24.792 --> 00:31:27.291
all those things, so-called diseases,

00:31:27.458 --> 00:31:30.458
so-called habits, just drop out

00:31:31.083 --> 00:31:35.667
and you become a new, blooming personality.

00:31:35.917 --> 00:31:42.375
Now the basics of having this center within you –

00:31:42.999 --> 00:31:45.875
you can blame God for that, “Why did He give us

00:31:45.917 --> 00:31:47.999
these centers on the left hand side, what was the need?

00:31:48.333 --> 00:31:50.333
He should not have given these left sided ones,

00:31:50.542 --> 00:31:52.750
so we would have been just in the center to go.”

00:31:53.125 --> 00:31:57.500
But the trouble is, the human beings have to know

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:01.250
in their own freedom, how to deal with themselves.

00:32:01.583 --> 00:32:05.375
They have to learn little hard way the wisdom.

00:32:05.667 --> 00:32:10.208
They have to know by going to extremes they have suffered.

00:32:10.417 --> 00:32:11.834
They have to realize it

00:32:12.291 --> 00:32:17.709
because if they have to become truly, absolutely free

00:32:18.834 --> 00:32:22.959
they have to rise in their wisdom.

00:32:23.333 --> 00:32:25.417
If they’re not wise people,

00:32:25.625 --> 00:32:28.166
then they cannot enter into the Kingdom of God

00:32:28.375 --> 00:32:29.625
because they’ll be abandoned people.

00:32:29.875 --> 00:32:32.583
Say, people who are abandoned,

00:32:32.834 --> 00:32:35.083
who don’t understand any laws or regulations,

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:38.792
if you get them in England, we’ll have to put them in jail.

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:42.333
In the same way, human beings who have not got

00:32:42.542 --> 00:32:45.417
that wisdom within themselves –

00:32:45.709 --> 00:32:47.667
through sufferings only one learns,

00:32:47.875 --> 00:32:49.500
but we should not ask for suffering.

00:32:49.834 --> 00:32:51.291
When we ask for sufferings,

00:32:51.375 --> 00:32:54.125
we are asking actually for mistakes to begin with.

00:32:54.166 --> 00:32:56.500
How will you suffer if you do not commit mistakes?

00:32:56.792 --> 00:33:00.041
So when we ask for sufferings we are committing mistakes.

00:33:00.583 --> 00:33:04.125
So what we should ask for is nothing but our Spirit.

00:33:04.333 --> 00:33:06.291
And if you ask for your Spirit,

00:33:06.625 --> 00:33:08.999
it is your own and you have to get it,

00:33:09.166 --> 00:33:12.875
it is in your own right that you’re going to get it.

00:33:13.333 --> 00:33:16.875
Is no way that I’m obliging you or doing something special for you,

00:33:17.083 --> 00:33:21.500
it’s all there. You are like a light which is just to be enlightened

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:24.500
because I’m an enlightened light

00:33:24.709 --> 00:33:26.375
and you become an enlightened light,

00:33:26.625 --> 00:33:28.458
you can enlighten other lights also.

00:33:28.709 --> 00:33:30.375
It’s very simple.

00:33:30.583 --> 00:33:33.583
If you become an enlightened light, you can enlighten others.

00:33:33.959 --> 00:33:35.625
You don’t have to bother about anything else then.

00:33:35.792 --> 00:33:39.834
You become an enlightened light yourself, that’s the point.

00:33:40.208 --> 00:33:44.166
It is all there, it is all your own, you have to just have it.

00:33:44.333 --> 00:33:46.959
It is as simple as that.

00:33:47.166 --> 00:33:52.166
There is nothing very complicated as these people make it

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:55.709
or anything that these philosophers have put before you.

00:33:55.834 --> 00:33:57.125
Nothing of the kind.

00:33:57.250 --> 00:34:01.208
It’s very simple, it is within you, it is spontaneous,

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:02.542
it is a living process,

00:34:02.959 --> 00:34:05.375
as in living process you have become human beings,

00:34:05.542 --> 00:34:07.417
you are going to become super human beings.

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:10.583
It’s absolutely spontaneous, you can’t pay for it.

00:34:11.083 --> 00:34:13.750
How can you pay? I mean, absurd it is!

00:34:14.083 --> 00:34:17.500
If it is a living process

00:34:18.375 --> 00:34:19.208
how can you pay?

00:34:19.458 --> 00:34:22.083
How much do you pay to the tree to grow up?

00:34:22.375 --> 00:34:24.834
I mean in anything living, do we pay anything?

00:34:24.875 --> 00:34:27.333
How much do we pay our nose to breathe?

00:34:27.667 --> 00:34:30.834
Can we pay for it? It’s absurd, it’s ridiculous.

00:34:31.041 --> 00:34:34.333
Can we pay for it? We cannot, it’s a living process,

00:34:34.583 --> 00:34:38.625
we have to become, an egg has to become a chick.

00:34:38.999 --> 00:34:41.417
Now how much do you pay an egg to become a chick?

00:34:41.667 --> 00:34:45.333
Or how much does the egg pay to the mother

00:34:45.667 --> 00:34:49.000
for becoming a chicken?

00:34:50.291 --> 00:34:54.500
It’s that ridiculous, but we never understand

00:34:54.583 --> 00:34:56.542
that living things are so spontaneous.

00:34:56.834 --> 00:34:59.208
We never see living things, we live with matter,

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:02.583
we live with the dead, not with the living things.

00:35:02.667 --> 00:35:05.625
If you start watching a tree, you start watching a flower,

00:35:05.875 --> 00:35:08.583
how it becomes a fruit.

00:35:09.083 --> 00:35:11.792
You can’t even watch because it does it so slowly,

00:35:12.041 --> 00:35:14.875
you can’t even watch a flower becoming a fruit.

00:35:15.166 --> 00:35:17.208
Suddenly you find all coming up.

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.959
Like when I came to London from India

00:35:21.125 --> 00:35:23.917
I found all the trees were bare,

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:28.041
absolutely like dry sticks, absolutely like dry sticks.

00:35:28.583 --> 00:35:32.583
Within a week, what I find is the green coming up;

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.041
and within second week it was all lush, you can’t believe it.

00:35:38.458 --> 00:35:41.125
We never even notice, we take it for granted,

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:44.999
it’s happening. How does it happen? It’s a miraculous thing.

00:35:45.083 --> 00:35:46.667
If you see it, it’s miraculous!

00:35:46.875 --> 00:35:47.917
How these flowers,

00:35:48.083 --> 00:35:51.500
for example the particular flowers are only on a particular tree

00:35:51.709 --> 00:35:55.542
and others, another, are on another tree. How does it happen?

00:35:56.083 --> 00:35:58.250
Who chooses them? Who puts them in proper shape?

00:35:58.458 --> 00:36:00.291
Who organizes all that?

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:02.792
And this is what one has to realize

00:36:03.041 --> 00:36:05.709
and that is the All Pervading Power of God

00:36:05.917 --> 00:36:09.291
that does all the living work.

00:36:09.709 --> 00:36:12.792
And once you become that – the Spirit –

00:36:13.041 --> 00:36:15.375
then this power starts flowing through you.

00:36:15.667 --> 00:36:19.250
You feel the power through you as Christ was touched

00:36:19.542 --> 00:36:24.542
and He said some power has gone to someone, like that.

00:36:24.875 --> 00:36:28.000
You just become a medium of that power flowing.

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:32.709
But you are empowered to manoeuvre it,

00:36:32.959 --> 00:36:34.750
to manage it, to understand it.

00:36:34.999 --> 00:36:36.250
You know completely about it,

00:36:36.458 --> 00:36:38.625
you know how to give it, you know to how to work it out,

00:36:38.834 --> 00:36:43.083
you know how to cure others, cure yourself.

00:36:43.583 --> 00:36:46.667
You know the complete working of your machinery.

00:36:47.125 --> 00:36:49.625
Apart from that, you get the powers

00:36:49.834 --> 00:36:54.875
to overcome all the problems of your own machinery also.

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.083
It’s so fantastic,

00:36:57.250 --> 00:36:58.999
whole thing sounds very fantastic

00:36:59.208 --> 00:37:01.083
because we have never seen this before.

00:37:01.291 --> 00:37:04.250
But to us it doesn’t sound fantastic when we see

00:37:04.667 --> 00:37:08.125
all these flowers suddenly turning into fruits.

00:37:08.291 --> 00:37:09.792
It doesn’t sound.

00:37:10.083 --> 00:37:13.208
But we see human beings turning into fruits,

00:37:13.834 --> 00:37:16.250
then it sounds very fantastic, “How can that be?”

00:37:16.333 --> 00:37:18.125
It has never happened before.

00:37:18.333 --> 00:37:20.291
Only one person would get realization

00:37:20.625 --> 00:37:23.375
and it was such a difficult thing and nobody got it.

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:25.625
How is it today?

00:37:26.792 --> 00:37:30.125
I say, it's the blossom time, which is been promised,

00:37:30.458 --> 00:37:34.041
which is been already prophesized.

00:37:34.291 --> 00:37:37.458
Even a great poet in your country,

00:37:37.625 --> 00:37:39.542
William Blake, has prophesized it.

00:37:39.959 --> 00:37:41.750
He said these times will come,

00:37:41.917 --> 00:37:46.125
when men of God will become prophets

00:37:46.625 --> 00:37:48.000
and these prophets

00:37:48.208 --> 00:37:50.208
will have power to make others prophets.

00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:53.625
I mean nobody could be more precise than Blake, I tell you.

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:57.000
He was so great to say this will happen

00:37:57.208 --> 00:37:59.959
and this is what we have to expect.

00:38:00.208 --> 00:38:02.083
when we go to anybody for seeking.

00:38:02.333 --> 00:38:05.667
Have we become prophets? And what is a prophet?

00:38:05.917 --> 00:38:08.625
Prophet is a person who is a collective being

00:38:08.959 --> 00:38:13.417
and who knows all about it, who is the master.

00:38:13.999 --> 00:38:16.417
We call prophet a master.

00:38:16.709 --> 00:38:19.250
And that’s what you have to become: The master!

00:38:19.583 --> 00:38:24.041
And that mastery is very simple because it’s all built within you

00:38:24.417 --> 00:38:26.999
just it has to be connected.

00:38:27.125 --> 00:38:31.083
Like anything like a television set is to be connected to the mains,

00:38:31.291 --> 00:38:33.667
it’s all built in, it’s there, it just starts working.

00:38:33.875 --> 00:38:37.875
In the same way you are that, you are that.

00:38:38.166 --> 00:38:39.667
Just it is to be connected.

00:38:39.999 --> 00:38:43.333
Whatever may be your caste, community, race,

00:38:43.875 --> 00:38:46.959
nationality, shapes, heights –

00:38:47.166 --> 00:38:50.000
anything whatever you may be, makes no difference

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:53.417
because all of you have got this great thing within you,

00:38:53.792 --> 00:38:56.959
this power of a rebirth

00:38:57.041 --> 00:39:00.500
and you are to be born again, and you will be born again.

00:39:00.709 --> 00:39:03.458
Why not today?

00:39:03.917 --> 00:39:07.625
There’s nothing to get angry, because people get angry sometimes

00:39:07.999 --> 00:39:11.959
because they don’t like anybody telling them

00:39:12.333 --> 00:39:17.542
about something which - of which they themselves are feeling bad.

00:39:17.917 --> 00:39:18.792
They don’t like it.

00:39:18.999 --> 00:39:22.083
For example if there’s a drunkard and he drinks too much,

00:39:22.333 --> 00:39:24.417
he’s an alcoholic, he doesn’t like it

00:39:24.792 --> 00:39:26.625
and he feels bad, and if somebody tells him,

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:30.166
even in the most gentlest way that “You’d better give up drinking",

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:32.375
he doesn’t like it.

00:39:33.166 --> 00:39:37.166
But what I am saying is not that you should not do it,

00:39:37.333 --> 00:39:40.500
I said it will happen that it just drops out.

00:39:40.667 --> 00:39:43.166
I don’t say, “You don’t do this” or “Don’t do that”,

00:39:43.417 --> 00:39:44.834
but it just happens.

00:39:44.959 --> 00:39:48.542
And you must first understand what is the problem

00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:51.125
and how the problem is overcome.

00:39:51.959 --> 00:39:53.542
That’s why I have to talk,

00:39:53.792 --> 00:39:57.250
otherwise there’s no need to talk about it all, it just works out.

00:39:57.458 --> 00:39:59.583
It just works out because you are just ready to have it

00:39:59.834 --> 00:40:02.417
and you just get it. I don’t do anything.

00:40:02.583 --> 00:40:06.750
I’m just a catalyst, I should say that it works out.

00:40:07.375 --> 00:40:10.083
I hope you’ll ask Me some questions about it first,

00:40:10.291 --> 00:40:14.375
before we go in for any realization.

00:40:15.834 --> 00:40:19.875
If you have any questions, please ask. You must ask.

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:28.000
Yes?

00:40:28.166 --> 00:40:32.500
Man: Is there any difference to what You are saying and

00:40:32.709 --> 00:40:35.542
what guru Maharaji …

00:40:36.959 --> 00:40:37.542
Who?

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:38.750
Man: Guru Maharaji

00:40:39.333 --> 00:40:41.834
Now, I’ll tell you one thing.

00:40:41.999 --> 00:40:45.250
When you talk about any guru I don’t want to go into controversies.

00:40:45.458 --> 00:40:47.000
All right? That’s first thing I’ll tell you.

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:50.792
But I will tell you to ask yourself or ask anyone,

00:40:50.959 --> 00:40:53.667
What has he done for anyone?

00:40:53.959 --> 00:40:56.208
Has he been able to give you any power,

00:40:56.417 --> 00:40:58.999
or anyone the power? All right?

00:40:59.208 --> 00:41:00.999
Now, I can tell you all these who are here

00:41:01.166 --> 00:41:02.875
who are realized souls who are here,

00:41:03.041 --> 00:41:04.250
they are just like you to look at.

00:41:04.458 --> 00:41:07.125
Of course from face you can make out that they’re very relaxed

00:41:07.333 --> 00:41:08.792
and very happy people.

00:41:09.083 --> 00:41:11.417
But they can cure people,

00:41:11.625 --> 00:41:13.917
they can give realization to people,

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:16.542
they understand everything that is

00:41:16.959 --> 00:41:20.208
wrong with you and with themselves also.

00:41:20.834 --> 00:41:22.917
So what has he done to your awareness?

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:26.166
Nothing.

00:41:27.667 --> 00:41:30.667
Now, his disciples, what have they achieved?

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:33.999
You ask them, “Where is the Kundalini of this person?

00:41:34.208 --> 00:41:35.999
What is the problem of this lady or

00:41:36.208 --> 00:41:39.625
what is weighing upon her mind?” They won’t be able to say.

00:41:39.875 --> 00:41:42.083
If you cannot even make out what’s wrong with another

00:41:42.291 --> 00:41:45.625
person or with yourself, how are you going to help?

00:41:46.083 --> 00:41:49.125
All such people, what do they do? Let us see.

00:41:49.709 --> 00:41:54.166
Simple thing is that they can mesmerize you.

00:41:54.583 --> 00:41:56.208
You may feel happy for a while,

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:59.834
it’s just like drinking, you know, if you drink, you feel happy.

00:42:00.208 --> 00:42:02.999
But, by drinking, what have you achieved?

00:42:03.208 --> 00:42:05.999
Have we become masters?

00:42:09.375 --> 00:42:10.750
All of them are like that.

00:42:11.041 --> 00:42:14.458
You see, this gentleman, so obviously

00:42:14.667 --> 00:42:16.417
because he asked for Rolls Royce.

00:42:16.625 --> 00:42:18.667
What is a Rolls Royce for a prophet?

00:42:18.917 --> 00:42:22.083
I mean what does it matter? You see My point?

00:42:22.458 --> 00:42:24.834
This is so obvious, I mean this is so logically obvious.

00:42:25.083 --> 00:42:28.458
First of all, anybody who takes money from you is a parasite,

00:42:28.875 --> 00:42:29.917
simple as that.

00:42:30.041 --> 00:42:33.667
And to ask for Rolls Royce of all the things, can you see?

00:42:33.959 --> 00:42:34.999
You have got Christ.

00:42:35.375 --> 00:42:40.375
You can see from Christ’s life. Will He care for your Rolls Royces?

00:42:41.583 --> 00:42:43.999
To such a person - He’s a king, He doesn’t bother

00:42:44.208 --> 00:42:45.834
whether He has a Rolls Royce or not,

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.542
whether He sleeps on the ground or not, makes no difference.

00:42:48.792 --> 00:42:50.583
Such a person doesn’t care for anything,

00:42:50.834 --> 00:42:55.792
because He is in comfort, He’s got His own comfort.

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:59.458
He is a man of Self-respect.

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:02.125
Do you think will He ask for anything whatsoever?

00:43:02.291 --> 00:43:04.458
I mean it’s so obvious,

00:43:04.709 --> 00:43:05.875
for you people it is so obvious.

00:43:06.041 --> 00:43:08.542
But when I talk to some people of this guru,

00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:10.709
the particular one you are telling Me,

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.959
they said: “ Mother, we gave him the metal and he gives us the Spirit.”

00:43:14.166 --> 00:43:16.500
Can there be an exchange?

00:43:16.875 --> 00:43:20.875
Can you purchase your Spirit? Use your logic, all right?

00:43:21.041 --> 00:43:24.041
God has given us brains to understand, logically we can use that.

00:43:24.291 --> 00:43:29.542
Can you, can you purchase, can you purchase the Spirit?

00:43:29.917 --> 00:43:31.500
Isn’t it so simple?

00:43:31.875 --> 00:43:36.834
We can't pay for it, My child, we cannot.

00:43:37.166 --> 00:43:39.125
If you want to give Me a flower, all right.

00:43:39.333 --> 00:43:43.458
It’s just an expression of your love, and that’s all.

00:43:43.709 --> 00:43:48.208
But you can’t purchase Me. You can’t.

00:43:48.709 --> 00:43:51.458
Your love can purchase Me, all right, that’s different.

00:43:51.709 --> 00:43:54.750
But you can’t purchase Me with metal and money, can you?

00:43:54.875 --> 00:43:57.542
What is a Rolls Royce?

00:43:57.917 --> 00:44:00.542
I mean I don’t know what are all these crowns and things.

00:44:00.792 --> 00:44:03.208
What are they good for? They don’t give you joy.

00:44:03.417 --> 00:44:06.792
Go and ask the people who wear the crowns.

00:44:07.083 --> 00:44:08.792
The other day I was with Mrs. Thatcher.

00:44:08.999 --> 00:44:11.291
Poor thing, she was so miserable.

00:44:12.834 --> 00:44:17.375
Yes, she was! You know I tried to sort of put her down,

00:44:17.625 --> 00:44:19.333
her vibrations. She was very miserable.

00:44:19.542 --> 00:44:21.875
We were just across the table talking to each other.

00:44:22.083 --> 00:44:23.625
And what I was doing was to balance her -

00:44:23.834 --> 00:44:28.709
poor thing, she was very, she’s very upset.

00:44:29.583 --> 00:44:32.542
So, you must understand, you are too simple people,

00:44:32.709 --> 00:44:35.875
you are seekers of ancient times.

00:44:35.999 --> 00:44:39.208
You are not seekers of today, you are seekers of ancient times.

00:44:39.417 --> 00:44:43.291
And this time has been promised to you before, also.

00:44:43.999 --> 00:44:46.041
And now you have to find it.

00:44:46.417 --> 00:44:50.125
Now you must keep your logic straight forward.

00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:52.750
I mean anybody who asks for Rolls Royce,

00:44:52.792 --> 00:44:56.250
I mean this is one of the stark examples I would say,

00:44:56.834 --> 00:44:59.875
cannot be any guru.

00:45:00.375 --> 00:45:04.333
It’s the starkest one, absolutely one of the …

00:45:05.375 --> 00:45:06.667
But there are subtler ones.

00:45:06.999 --> 00:45:07.792
He’s not so subtle.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.583
You will get out of it in no time, I know, all of you.

00:45:10.792 --> 00:45:13.667
But the subtler ones are even worse.

00:45:14.375 --> 00:45:18.709
Some of them may not even ask for money, may not.

00:45:18.959 --> 00:45:21.500
I don’t know of any, but there may be some

00:45:21.875 --> 00:45:25.875
because I heard about someone who doesn’t now take money,

00:45:26.333 --> 00:45:27.291
in India.

00:45:27.583 --> 00:45:30.999
He has made money here and now he’s gone to India

00:45:31.291 --> 00:45:34.000
and he doesn’t take money from them.

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:38.875
But the one who has really not taken money,

00:45:39.083 --> 00:45:45.125
one person whom I know, has been using women.

00:45:48.625 --> 00:45:53.750
He’s not interested in money part, he’s using your women.

00:45:54.291 --> 00:45:57.875
You see so this is what it is, you must understand.

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.166
His interest is not in your Spirit,

00:46:00.375 --> 00:46:04.208
but in your purse or in your women. Imagine.

00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:09.709
How can holiness be combined with these dirty habits of people?

00:46:10.083 --> 00:46:14.792
That means they themselves are under the control of their desires

00:46:15.166 --> 00:46:19.083
which are anti-God.

00:46:22.417 --> 00:46:24.959
These are all anti-God activities.

00:46:25.375 --> 00:46:28.750
And you people being so simple hearted, I tell you,

00:46:28.959 --> 00:46:30.999
you’re so simple hearted!

00:46:31.375 --> 00:46:35.542
If you tell an Indian that a guru takes a Rolls Royce, he says “Eh.”

00:46:35.834 --> 00:46:40.083
Immediately they’ll cancel. They know this guy, How can they?

00:46:40.333 --> 00:46:42.750
Nobody will give to any guru in India.

00:46:42.999 --> 00:46:48.000
Gurus have to pay people sometimes first to entice them.

00:46:48.333 --> 00:46:49.834
Westernized Indians, it’s different;

00:46:49.999 --> 00:46:53.041
but those who are real Indians, they, you see they are -

00:46:53.208 --> 00:46:58.125
people live with the mothers and they know what is what, you know.

00:46:58.333 --> 00:47:02.208
Nobody can befool them, they’re very practical people.

00:47:02.709 --> 00:47:03.500
Yes, My Child?

00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:08.333
Woman: Can you be healed through faith?

00:47:09.291 --> 00:47:12.458
O, the faith is two types,

00:47:12.709 --> 00:47:15.583
with what we call in Sanskrit is 'Shraddha',

00:47:15.792 --> 00:47:18.875
is different from what you call as faith.

00:47:19.041 --> 00:47:23.000
In English they use it as “blind faith” and another as faith.

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:25.333
All right? We can make it like that.

00:47:25.542 --> 00:47:29.959
Now, the blind faith is this, that “I have got faith in God

00:47:30.417 --> 00:47:33.667
and God will heal me.” This is one faith. All right?

00:47:33.959 --> 00:47:37.333
Another is a faith which is enlightened

00:47:37.583 --> 00:47:40.792
where I say you are the Spirit when you are connected.

00:47:41.208 --> 00:47:45.750
Now, if you say that “I have faith in God”,

00:47:46.333 --> 00:47:48.959
you shouldn’t feel hurt when I tell you the truth, all right?

00:47:49.375 --> 00:47:52.333
Because if it is a blind faith means

00:47:52.583 --> 00:47:57.458
that you are not yet connected with the power. Not connected.

00:47:57.875 --> 00:48:00.583
See, now supposing I start saying,

00:48:00.792 --> 00:48:03.041
“Christ, Christ, Christ, Christ!”

00:48:03.375 --> 00:48:06.458
Christ is not in my pocket.

00:48:07.417 --> 00:48:10.999
I can’t even meet a prime minister or a queen

00:48:11.166 --> 00:48:15.999
without having a protocol or a connection or some sort of a,

00:48:16.041 --> 00:48:22.000
you see, position or, we can say, an authority. Isn’t it?

00:48:22.375 --> 00:48:24.458
Now when we talk of anyone like that,

00:48:24.709 --> 00:48:27.667
some people go on saying, “Rama, Rama, Rama, Krishna, Krishna",

00:48:27.917 --> 00:48:33.375
You see, these are all incarnations and Christ is the Son of God.

00:48:33.834 --> 00:48:38.417
He is the Son of a King and you just can’t meet Him.

00:48:38.792 --> 00:48:44.250
You can’t just call Him. He’s not at your beck and call,

00:48:45.041 --> 00:48:47.625
He’s not your servant. All right?

00:48:47.917 --> 00:48:52.999
Now, to having faith like that when you are not connected,

00:48:53.417 --> 00:48:56.458
if you are healed, you are healed by some other agencies,

00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:58.542
not by Christ.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:03.125
But if you are a realized soul and then you are healed,

00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:05.875
then it is done by Christ.

00:49:06.999 --> 00:49:10.375
I’ll tell you a difference, a very clear cut difference of healing.

00:49:11.458 --> 00:49:14.875
We have in England – we had, I don’t know now if you have that one,

00:49:14.999 --> 00:49:16.625
it’s an organization called

00:49:16.875 --> 00:49:21.959
an 'International Curative Center of Late Dr. Lang'.

00:49:22.291 --> 00:49:28.166
Now this Dr. Lang was dead, I mean he was late

00:49:28.792 --> 00:49:31.291
but he had a curative center.

00:49:31.583 --> 00:49:36.917
You see, and this gentleman died

00:49:37.333 --> 00:49:43.875
and he possessed a man in Vietnam, a soldier,

00:49:44.041 --> 00:49:46.667
not his own son but a soldier.

00:49:46.959 --> 00:49:49.125
Now this soldier was told by this fellow –

00:49:49.333 --> 00:49:51.041
I mean, they’re very honest people,

00:49:51.291 --> 00:49:53.500
being English, they are honest and they tell the truth, you see.

00:49:53.709 --> 00:49:56.458
They don’t say that “we do it through God” or anything.

00:49:56.959 --> 00:50:00.417
So he told that there are many doctors -

00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:03.875
I hope the doctors won’t mind - who have died

00:50:04.125 --> 00:50:08.583
and who were very ambitious are still wanting to cure people.

00:50:09.333 --> 00:50:12.667
And "He should  go back to my son and tell him all the story

00:50:12.875 --> 00:50:16.750
that I’ve come in you and my son will believe.”

00:50:16.959 --> 00:50:18.291
So he said, “How will he believe me?”

00:50:18.542 --> 00:50:20.458
He said, “No, no. I will tell you some secrets

00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:23.250
which only he and me, both of us share.

00:50:23.583 --> 00:50:25.500
So he’ll definitely believe you.”

00:50:26.208 --> 00:50:28.625
So this fellow agreed. He was a very healthy fellow,

00:50:28.875 --> 00:50:31.250
actually this Spirit entered into him

00:50:31.458 --> 00:50:33.709
when he got into a certain shock,

00:50:34.041 --> 00:50:36.417
something he saw which shocked him in the war

00:50:36.583 --> 00:50:38.041
and this Spirit entered.

00:50:38.375 --> 00:50:42.166
And he was carried by that Spirit somehow

00:50:42.875 --> 00:50:46.875
to England where he met his son and he told the whole story.

00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:50.583
And the son had to believe because he knew so many secrets.

00:50:50.875 --> 00:50:52.792
And they started this curative center.

00:50:53.041 --> 00:50:57.458
Now how do I come to know of late Mr. Lang, is the thing.

00:50:58.125 --> 00:51:03.917
They cured a lady who was in India -

00:51:04.208 --> 00:51:06.709
long time back- it was 1970 I’m telling you.

00:51:07.291 --> 00:51:08.542
And she came to see Me,

00:51:08.834 --> 00:51:10.709
and she was all shaking, nervous, she’s like this.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.333
I said, “What’s this?”

00:51:12.583 --> 00:51:15.625
She said, “I was sick with a certain disease

00:51:15.875 --> 00:51:19.250
and I was afraid of an operation

00:51:19.542 --> 00:51:23.458
and I came to know about this organization, I wrote to them

00:51:23.875 --> 00:51:26.208
and they wrote to me saying that 'at this time

00:51:26.417 --> 00:51:29.125
on this date we’ll enter into your body."

00:51:29.333 --> 00:51:33.000
Openly, I mean they don’t say that “We are God” or anything.

00:51:33.291 --> 00:51:34.875
“We’ll enter into your body

00:51:35.166 --> 00:51:37.250
and you’ll feel a little shaking, doesn’t matter,

00:51:37.542 --> 00:51:40.250
and you’ll sleep off and we’ll work it out.”

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:43.875
And she said, “I got cured of that disease.”

00:51:44.417 --> 00:51:46.875
But after three years or so,

00:51:47.083 --> 00:51:49.500
the whole body started shaking

00:51:49.917 --> 00:51:53.333
and she couldn’t bear it anymore and she came to see Me.

00:51:53.667 --> 00:51:56.625
That’s how I came to know about Dr. Lang, you see,

00:51:56.917 --> 00:52:02.083
that he had – this poor lady was tortured for three years,

00:52:02.333 --> 00:52:05.333
she suffered so much. And then she came to see Me.

00:52:05.583 --> 00:52:08.999
So after Mr. Lang entered into her body – Dr. Lang –

00:52:09.375 --> 00:52:11.417
it was after six years that she came to see Me because

00:52:11.625 --> 00:52:13.000
three years she was all right,

00:52:13.208 --> 00:52:15.083
and after three years it started.

00:52:15.333 --> 00:52:17.542
And that’s how I came to know all the Spirits

00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:20.375
that had entered into her, the doctors and all that.

00:52:20.625 --> 00:52:22.250
It was a horrible case.

00:52:22.542 --> 00:52:24.834
Of course she got cured later on, no doubt.

00:52:25.333 --> 00:52:27.041
Because when you become the Spirit,

00:52:27.375 --> 00:52:30.208
you are in your fort, nobody can enter into your body.

00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:35.125
You become something which doesn’t get contaminated,

00:52:35.417 --> 00:52:40.417
doesn’t get over powered, nobody can dominate.

00:52:41.083 --> 00:52:42.500
And that’s how she got cured.

00:52:42.709 --> 00:52:47.875
So with faith, if somebody says, “Oh, you will be healed” you see

00:52:48.291 --> 00:52:50.667
and they start shouting and screaming and this and that,

00:52:50.959 --> 00:52:54.166
and suddenly you might feel, maybe there’s a Spirit.

00:52:54.417 --> 00:52:57.792
They replace also sometimes these Spirits, it’s very surprising.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.125
They can replace a Spirit from one to another.

00:53:00.375 --> 00:53:02.000
I’ve seen such cases also.

00:53:02.583 --> 00:53:04.041
All kinds of things I have seen in Spirits.

00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:08.125
The other day, only about eight days back, wasn’t that,

00:53:08.375 --> 00:53:11.917
Marie, when this charismatic fellow came in?

00:53:12.834 --> 00:53:17.208
Eight days back in France a gentleman came in.

00:53:17.834 --> 00:53:22.458
Young fellow, must be about twenty-four or so.

00:53:23.291 --> 00:53:28.417
He got into such a big agitation and started crying

00:53:28.667 --> 00:53:31.959
and a funny type of a thing that I’ve never seen,

00:53:32.291 --> 00:53:34.041
a Spirit, entered into him.

00:53:34.250 --> 00:53:36.917
Whole body was shaking. And I mean he fell down,

00:53:37.166 --> 00:53:40.417
he started crying, weeping, all sorts of things happened.

00:53:40.875 --> 00:53:43.542
And he said that “I went to charismatic movement where I got it,

00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:44.792
and many get it."

00:53:45.041 --> 00:53:47.291
And they think Holy Ghost has entered into them.

00:53:47.583 --> 00:53:51.458
Now just imagine. How can Holy Ghost make you miserable?

00:53:51.875 --> 00:53:54.750
I don’t know from where these ideas come in.

00:53:55.333 --> 00:53:59.208
And poor child, you know, he suffered so much. Now he’s all right.

00:53:59.458 --> 00:54:01.999
But he couldn’t believe it that you could be all right,

00:54:02.166 --> 00:54:03.250
because he thought …

00:54:03.458 --> 00:54:04.458
and then they say,

00:54:04.667 --> 00:54:07.250
“These are your sins and you have to get over your sins

00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:09.542
and this is why you are, what’s happening to you,

00:54:09.875 --> 00:54:12.291
you still have done bad karmas, and this and that.

00:54:12.583 --> 00:54:14.583
But your bad karmas and all those things

00:54:14.875 --> 00:54:18.041
can be solved when the Kundalini rises.

00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:21.792
There is a center for this specially

00:54:21.999 --> 00:54:29.875
which is really being adorned by Jesus Christ here.

00:54:31.208 --> 00:54:33.208
Did you tell them, about this center?

00:54:34.291 --> 00:54:34.999
All right.

00:54:35.166 --> 00:54:38.000
So this is the center, that when the Kundalini passes through that –

00:54:38.208 --> 00:54:41.500
that’s why they say that you have to pass through it -

00:54:42.208 --> 00:54:45.792
He gets awakened, and when He gets awakened all these

00:54:46.291 --> 00:54:49.750
two pouches you see, they are of ego and superego, your conditioning

00:54:50.208 --> 00:54:52.709
and all your left sided problems and right sided problems

00:54:52.917 --> 00:54:53.875
are sucked in.

00:54:54.208 --> 00:54:57.250
That’s why they said that He died for our sins.

00:54:57.500 --> 00:54:59.834
He is described in the ancient Indian scriptures

00:55:00.041 --> 00:55:01.834
as Mahavishnu but you see

00:55:02.041 --> 00:55:05.750
when the missionaries went to India

00:55:05.959 --> 00:55:08.917
they gave a very wrong picture of Christ, absolutely wrong picture,

00:55:09.083 --> 00:55:12.709
so they were still expecting Mahavishnu to come in.

00:55:13.291 --> 00:55:14.583
And this is what it is.

00:55:14.834 --> 00:55:19.083
He’s supposed to be, according to missionaries,

00:55:19.291 --> 00:55:23.458
somebody who sort of converts people and all that nonsense. See?

00:55:24.542 --> 00:55:27.542
It’s not the real thing, that He is to be awakened within us.

00:55:27.792 --> 00:55:31.000
He said that. He said, “I have to be born within you.”

00:55:31.625 --> 00:55:32.750
And that is what it is.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.500
When Kundalini rises, She awakens that center within us

00:55:37.792 --> 00:55:41.083
and all our conditionings and egos are sucked in,

00:55:41.333 --> 00:55:42.917
a space is created

00:55:43.083 --> 00:55:46.291
here in the fontanel bone area through which the Kundalini comes in

00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:49.917
and you can feel the cool breeze from your head coming out.

00:55:50.291 --> 00:55:52.750
That’s what it is. And you feel it in your hands.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.250
It’s not just that you’re mad after someone, you see?

00:55:56.999 --> 00:55:58.500
It isn’t like that.

00:55:59.208 --> 00:56:02.709
It’s not that way, you see, nothing of that kind.

00:56:03.250 --> 00:56:09.417
You become a Self-respecting, normal, dignified personality

00:56:09.625 --> 00:56:13.750
of great Spiritual value, which you are.

00:56:14.458 --> 00:56:15.291
All right?

00:56:15.583 --> 00:56:20.250
So this is what faith is and what is blind faith is.

00:56:22.417 --> 00:56:23.792
Yes, My child.

00:56:24.458 --> 00:56:27.291
Man: It seems very difficult the concept that

00:56:27.709 --> 00:56:32.999
Self-realization doesn’t involve some personal effort.

00:56:33.458 --> 00:56:38.083
Can it really come to anybody in effect of how

00:56:38.583 --> 00:56:42.375
materialistic they are? Am I understanding this?

00:56:44.083 --> 00:56:48.333
Yes, it appears on the face of it very difficult

00:56:49.333 --> 00:56:53.041
and how people are materialistic is also true no doubt,

00:56:53.333 --> 00:56:57.500
but Spirit is much stronger than the matter.

00:56:57.999 --> 00:57:00.750
And when It has to express, it

00:57:01.375 --> 00:57:05.625
completely crushes all that and It comes.

00:57:05.917 --> 00:57:09.166
Now, we have here, most of you are English people I should say,

00:57:09.417 --> 00:57:12.500
westernized, very materialistic people they were,

00:57:12.959 --> 00:57:14.417
I should say, I mean living in that world,

00:57:14.625 --> 00:57:16.166
they may not have been that materialistic

00:57:16.417 --> 00:57:19.875
because if they are not seekers, they would not come to Me.

00:57:20.125 --> 00:57:22.834
But a new being has been born.

00:57:23.166 --> 00:57:27.959
If you look at an egg you feel, “Oh, what a hard stuff is this!”

00:57:28.417 --> 00:57:30.709
But if it is broken at the right moment,

00:57:31.208 --> 00:57:34.834
with the right understanding, it becomes a bird.

00:57:35.291 --> 00:57:37.333
Because a living process is all,

00:57:37.542 --> 00:57:40.417
only the last breakthrough has to take place.

00:57:40.792 --> 00:57:45.625
Apparently it looks difficult, but to Me it is not.

00:57:46.208 --> 00:57:48.750
Perhaps I know the job.

00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:50.583
All right?

00:57:54.667 --> 00:57:57.000
Yes, it looks … many people have said all kinds of things

00:57:57.208 --> 00:57:58.291
about Kundalini, also.

00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:00.625
I must say some books I have seen have horrified.

00:58:00.999 --> 00:58:02.709
You see if you don’t know the job, everything –

00:58:02.917 --> 00:58:05.875
supposing if somebody else doesn’t know how to drive a car, you see,

00:58:06.041 --> 00:58:07.417
and he gets into the car

00:58:07.625 --> 00:58:09.417
the way he’d describe it would be horrifying.

00:58:09.625 --> 00:58:13.375
You’d never get near a car, isn’t it? It’s like that.

00:58:13.583 --> 00:58:14.875
The one who is not authorized and

00:58:15.041 --> 00:58:17.875
does not know the job should not do it.

00:58:18.208 --> 00:58:21.834
But that’s what happens to you, that you become

00:58:22.291 --> 00:58:25.000
the Spirit, you become your own master

00:58:25.333 --> 00:58:29.500
and you become the master of this art – the master of this art!

00:58:29.709 --> 00:58:31.500
Yes, My child?

00:58:41.959 --> 00:58:46.083
I couldn't hear you?

00:58:47.041 --> 00:58:49.625
You mentioned hypnosis earlier and

00:58:49.875 --> 00:58:54.709
You also said that You regarded Yourself as a catalyst...

00:58:55.208 --> 00:58:59.291
Don’t You think that the hypnotist also regards himself as a catalyst?

00:58:59.625 --> 00:59:02.333
Yes, very true. Yes, yes, no doubt!

00:59:02.834 --> 00:59:06.166
Yes, yes that’s true, but the difference is this,

00:59:06.417 --> 00:59:09.875
that the hypnotist brings you under his power.

00:59:10.041 --> 00:59:14.792
He doesn’t give you any power or no new dimension to your awareness,

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.999
you see? There’s a tremendous difference between the two.

00:59:18.208 --> 00:59:21.208
You see, you have got your own power within you.

00:59:21.417 --> 00:59:24.166
Say, for example, all right, your Spirit there.

00:59:24.375 --> 00:59:27.583
Now I’m a catalyst, you see, you can use a spoon

00:59:27.792 --> 00:59:32.625
for giving a poison or could use it for giving a nectar.

00:59:32.917 --> 00:59:34.125
All right?

00:59:34.333 --> 00:59:37.959
So if you give the nectar, then it’s a great thing;

00:59:38.125 --> 00:59:41.125
and if you give the poison, it’s horrible. It’s like that.

00:59:41.333 --> 00:59:44.500
Now the hypnotist uses hypnosis –

00:59:44.709 --> 00:59:47.333
how does he hypnotize is the point.

00:59:47.542 --> 00:59:50.583
What he does is to push you into your subconscious,

00:59:50.792 --> 00:59:54.208
into your collective subconscious where he overpowers you.

00:59:54.709 --> 00:59:55.959
You are under his power.

00:59:56.125 --> 00:59:59.208
He says, “You become like a child”, you become like a child.

00:59:59.417 --> 01:00:02.000
“You suck a little bottle”, you do it. What’s all this?

01:00:02.417 --> 01:00:04.208
But here you become

01:00:04.417 --> 01:00:08.417
the Spirit in the sense that you become collectively conscious.

01:00:08.875 --> 01:00:12.750
It’s no hypnosis because you yourself can feel it.

01:00:13.375 --> 01:00:16.917
Now, say example you take ten children who are realized souls.

01:00:17.125 --> 01:00:18.959
There are some children who are realized souls,

01:00:19.125 --> 01:00:21.083
even little children.

01:00:21.667 --> 01:00:23.166
And you take them near a person

01:00:23.375 --> 01:00:25.917
who is suffering from some trouble, all right?

01:00:26.125 --> 01:00:27.917
Now you tie up their eyes

01:00:28.083 --> 01:00:31.542
and ask them, “What’s the problem of this gentleman?”

01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:33.625
They will raise the same fingers,

01:00:33.834 --> 01:00:37.041
all of them will raise the same fingers, say "This is burning."

01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:39.625
You see, because the sensation you feel –

01:00:39.834 --> 01:00:43.917
of burning, of numbness or of cool breeze,

01:00:44.291 --> 01:00:49.125
a new awareness of a vibratory nature is born within you.

01:00:49.417 --> 01:00:50.500
Not with hypnosis.

01:00:50.709 --> 01:00:53.875
On the contrary, after hypnosis you feel so tired and finished

01:00:54.041 --> 01:00:58.291
as if somebody has been riding your horse.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.291
It’s just the other way round.

01:01:00.542 --> 01:01:03.542
And you start growing into you and understanding,

01:01:03.834 --> 01:01:07.208
you can cure people you understand what are the centers

01:01:07.542 --> 01:01:08.792
that are catching,

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.417
you understand what are the centers of another person that are catching.

01:01:12.667 --> 01:01:15.375
In the beginning sometimes people have confusion, I've seen,

01:01:15.999 --> 01:01:18.792
that they don’t know whether these are my centers or your centers.

01:01:19.041 --> 01:01:21.959
But we have ways and methods by which you can discriminate.

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.291
You can see which are your centers catching

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:26.625
and which are the centers the other person catching.

01:01:26.875 --> 01:01:30.291
You also know how to get them all right,

01:01:30.583 --> 01:01:33.125
you also know how to give realization to others,

01:01:33.333 --> 01:01:36.999
and to empower them with their own powers.

01:01:37.625 --> 01:01:39.999
It’s just the opposite.

01:01:40.583 --> 01:01:43.041
But catalyst could be horrifying,

01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:47.417
and catalyst could be just heavenly.

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:57.625
Question: Can a person selfrealize themselves

01:01:57.834 --> 01:01:59.458
through their own effort (...)?

01:01:59.959 --> 01:02:01.750
With their own effort?

01:02:03.041 --> 01:02:06.417
O, that I don’t think is possible, you see, because

01:02:06.625 --> 01:02:10.834
like a light which is enlightened can only enlighten another light.

01:02:11.583 --> 01:02:16.959
But what I’m saying, that even supposing like Buddha, you see,

01:02:17.166 --> 01:02:19.999
He got His realization when He was absolutely tired

01:02:20.166 --> 01:02:22.917
and He had to have it. Of course the Holy Ghost did that.

01:02:23.083 --> 01:02:24.834
He could not have done it on Him,

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.458
but He got the realization there

01:02:28.667 --> 01:02:32.375
because it was a different circumstance which He had to live,

01:02:32.667 --> 01:02:34.208
He didn’t have to talk about God,

01:02:34.417 --> 01:02:36.375
He didn’t have to talk about the whole thing.

01:02:36.667 --> 01:02:40.750
Because people were so much engaged

01:02:40.959 --> 01:02:43.208
in talking of big things like God

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:46.291
and about all kind of deities, this, that,

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:47.999
there was a big confusion.

01:02:48.291 --> 01:02:50.500
And somebody was to be realized at that time

01:02:50.709 --> 01:02:52.583
who would just localize it and say,

01:02:52.792 --> 01:02:56.417
“Only Self-realization! Don’t talk of God or anything, forget it.”

01:02:56.625 --> 01:02:58.709
That’s why He got realization like that.

01:02:59.208 --> 01:03:01.750
But you cannot get realization just like that –

01:03:02.083 --> 01:03:05.834
only possession you can get. You cannot.

01:03:06.458 --> 01:03:09.208
Somebody who is an enlightened soul,

01:03:09.458 --> 01:03:12.959
such an enlightened soul doesn’t take money from you.

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:16.542
Normally, you see, people don’t want to give you realization.

01:03:16.834 --> 01:03:19.166
Ninety-nine percent of those who are really realized,

01:03:19.375 --> 01:03:21.750
they will throw stones at you, they won’t have anything to do with you

01:03:21.959 --> 01:03:25.000
because their experiences of human beings are horrifying.

01:03:25.208 --> 01:03:27.375
If you go and talk to them, they’ll tell Me,

01:03:27.583 --> 01:03:29.709
they told Me that “Wait for twelve years.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.999
See, Mother, they will all finish You off,

01:03:33.166 --> 01:03:34.999
they’ll kill You, they’ll do this.”

01:03:35.417 --> 01:03:37.333
It’s very venturesome to deal with human beings

01:03:37.583 --> 01:03:41.166
because they’ll be very egoistical and they will never accept you.

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:45.375
But if you take like this, like

01:03:47.417 --> 01:03:51.583
somebody who knows, is a help, isn’t it?

01:03:52.625 --> 01:03:56.999
And realization is not possible, is not possible

01:03:57.458 --> 01:04:01.041
to be done by yourself. It’s not possible.

01:04:01.417 --> 01:04:05.583
Because if a, say, a candle which is not enlightened

01:04:05.792 --> 01:04:07.542
wants to get itself enlightened,

01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:10.166
the light has to be brought, isn’t it?

01:04:10.792 --> 01:04:12.375
It’s so simple as that.

01:04:12.667 --> 01:04:15.417
But one should not feel bad about it, actually.

01:04:15.834 --> 01:04:18.583
See, I don’t know how to drive, somebody drove Me down here.

01:04:18.792 --> 01:04:22.792
I didn’t feel bad that he had to drive Me down, did I?

01:04:23.166 --> 01:04:25.291
And I only know one job. I don’t know many.

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:27.458
Many jobs I don’t know, I don’t know how to operate bank,

01:04:27.667 --> 01:04:31.792
I don’t know how to write a check, I’m hopeless in many things.

01:04:32.083 --> 01:04:34.583
I don’t know how to open a can, maybe.

01:04:34.959 --> 01:04:37.750
But I know how to open the Kundalini.

01:04:37.959 --> 01:04:40.625
All right? So if I know one job, why should you mind?

01:04:40.834 --> 01:04:44.750
After all, we depend on each other for everything, isn't it?

01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:47.959
So why not, if I know the job, what’s the harm?

01:04:48.250 --> 01:04:50.875
And you will know, too.

01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:52.792
You will know, too.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.125
But it cannot be done by yourself.

01:04:55.750 --> 01:05:00.291
But actually in this you’re not obliged for anything.

01:05:03.083 --> 01:05:05.750
I just do it because I love it.

01:05:06.083 --> 01:05:08.417
It’s just emits, I don’t do anyway, I’m just flowing,

01:05:08.625 --> 01:05:13.709
I don’t know how it happens, just it’s flowing.

01:05:19.917 --> 01:05:21.792
I just love for love’s sake.

01:05:21.999 --> 01:05:24.166
Just, you can’t believe such a person can exist,

01:05:24.375 --> 01:05:27.291
but I do really, I am like that.

01:05:27.542 --> 01:05:28.750
Sometimes you might even,

01:05:28.959 --> 01:05:32.000
some of the Sahaja Yogis do feel that I’m too compassionate

01:05:32.417 --> 01:05:35.458
and that I should be rather strict with people and things like that,

01:05:35.667 --> 01:05:38.375
you see, they come and tell Me some wisdom about it.

01:05:43.583 --> 01:05:46.291
You see they think I’m not so practical,

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:49.750
but this is the most practical thing.

01:05:50.917 --> 01:05:53.625
Yes, I know they make mistakes

01:05:53.834 --> 01:05:55.667
because they don't know they are walking in darkness.

01:05:55.875 --> 01:05:58.208
If you are walking in darkness, you will bang at something.

01:05:58.417 --> 01:06:00.750
Then only thing you can do is to have compassion for them

01:06:00.959 --> 01:06:05.166
because they can’t see, they are blind. Isn’t it?

01:06:05.834 --> 01:06:09.542
How can you have any anger or temper?

01:06:19.834 --> 01:06:23.792
And moreover, I would request you not to have any misidentification

01:06:23.999 --> 01:06:25.500
with anyone whatsoever.

01:06:25.999 --> 01:06:29.000
You have to get to your Spirit, that’s the main thing.

01:06:29.583 --> 01:06:32.208
If you still think of somebody, you see,

01:06:32.417 --> 01:06:34.625
like the lady – I don’t know, somebody might have sent her here,

01:06:34.834 --> 01:06:36.625
maybe. I don’t know why she got angry.

01:06:36.834 --> 01:06:38.959
I didn’t say anything to hurt her.

01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:41.000
Maybe she is possessed.

01:06:41.208 --> 01:06:43.583
I don’t know why she has got angry with Me,

01:06:43.834 --> 01:06:45.750
and she just got up and just walked off saying that

01:06:45.999 --> 01:06:47.792
“You’re telling everything lies.”

01:06:50.208 --> 01:06:51.959
Why should I tell you lies?

01:06:52.125 --> 01:06:55.000
I don’t have to get anything out of you.

01:06:57.542 --> 01:07:00.542
But why it happens? Because she’s not sensitive,

01:07:00.834 --> 01:07:03.792
she’s not sensitive to Divinity.

01:07:05.417 --> 01:07:09.999
She doesn’t understand who’s Divine, who’s not. I don’t blame her.

01:07:10.583 --> 01:07:12.625
She hasn’t got the sensitivity. It’s a calibre.

01:07:12.875 --> 01:07:16.333
I have seen sahaja yogis now of different varieties have come to Me.

01:07:16.959 --> 01:07:19.458
Some of them are of such a calibre you can’t even believe.

01:07:19.709 --> 01:07:21.583
They get into realization, they know what it is,

01:07:21.792 --> 01:07:23.417
they have the pattern just like a diamond,

01:07:23.625 --> 01:07:24.917
they get it and they get into it.

01:07:25.166 --> 01:07:27.083
They’re tremendous people.

01:07:27.625 --> 01:07:30.208
There are some who slog behind.

01:07:30.417 --> 01:07:35.458
Some of them who get realization but still

01:07:35.792 --> 01:07:38.583
they go on doubting, all kinds.

01:07:39.041 --> 01:07:43.041
Doesn’t matter. I love all of them.

01:07:45.417 --> 01:07:46.417
Yes, My child?

01:08:03.999 --> 01:08:05.625
He is a sahaja yogi?

01:08:09.542 --> 01:08:11.333
So what is he talking now?

01:08:17.875 --> 01:08:18.834
What did he say?

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.250
He's saying Mother, if before realization

01:08:21.458 --> 01:08:23.041
we were such a horrible person that

01:08:23.250 --> 01:08:27.458
we gave cancer to everybody we met or something like this,

01:08:27.834 --> 01:08:32.458
after realization does the effects of that get taken away

01:08:32.750 --> 01:08:34.000
or what happens?

01:08:34.208 --> 01:08:37.458
Yah. I know it, so many things have happened.

01:08:37.834 --> 01:08:40.792
We had somebody in Brighton, you remember –

01:08:41.166 --> 01:08:44.542
he’s here right now, I think –

01:08:44.834 --> 01:08:46.625
who was drunk when he came in.

01:08:46.999 --> 01:08:49.125
He was very angry with Me, you see, to begin with.

01:08:49.458 --> 01:08:50.959
He said, “How can I get rid of this trouble?

01:08:51.208 --> 01:08:53.000
I can’t believe You”, and all that.

01:08:53.375 --> 01:08:55.542
And he’s all right, perfectly all right.

01:08:55.834 --> 01:08:58.667
His change is so beautiful, you can’t… is he there?

01:08:58.875 --> 01:08:59.667
Yogi: Yes , I am.

01:08:59.999 --> 01:09:02.166
May God bless you.

01:09:05.999 --> 01:09:08.917
He’s so sweet now. The other day he came to see Me.

01:09:09.083 --> 01:09:13.083
I said, “Look at that. He’s so sweet.”

01:09:13.333 --> 01:09:16.375
He was a very sweet man, wasn’t he?

01:09:16.750 --> 01:09:21.208
But something had put him up, made him upset, you see,

01:09:21.875 --> 01:09:24.250
that he became alcoholic, you see.

01:09:24.542 --> 01:09:25.875
He’s all right.

01:09:26.291 --> 01:09:29.917
And the compassion can only make you understand this

01:09:30.625 --> 01:09:31.999
that there’s a reason for this –

01:09:32.333 --> 01:09:36.999
He is a very sweet person, very sweet person no doubt.

01:09:37.667 --> 01:09:39.667
But something had gone wrong with him.

01:09:40.208 --> 01:09:42.208
It’s all right.

01:09:44.792 --> 01:09:47.417
So this happens, it’s true.

01:09:47.625 --> 01:09:49.959
Sahaja yogis realize this.

01:09:50.208 --> 01:09:54.583
Some, of course, I must say, go little bit, doesn’t matter.

01:09:55.291 --> 01:09:57.125
They’ll come up, all of them will come up,

01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:59.999
I’m sure of it.

01:10:03.166 --> 01:10:06.333
Everyone is made for it.

01:10:06.917 --> 01:10:09.834
Actually, the Divine is anxious to give you realization –

01:10:10.208 --> 01:10:13.792
much more, much more anxious than you are.

01:10:14.375 --> 01:10:15.667
If there were thousand people today,

01:10:15.875 --> 01:10:18.291
I would have given them realization better.

01:10:18.959 --> 01:10:21.333
But very few people take to reality, you see now.

01:10:21.625 --> 01:10:26.875
That guru Maharaji, thousands are like mad after him, isn’t it?

01:10:27.542 --> 01:10:30.834
He’s given nothing to the poor people.

01:10:32.291 --> 01:10:35.999
But for reality, there are very few.

01:10:38.291 --> 01:10:40.667
Like the other day somebody asked Me a question,

01:10:40.917 --> 01:10:42.959
“Mother, why don’t You do it to everyone?”

01:10:43.125 --> 01:10:46.792
I said, “Where are they, everyone? They are missing.

01:10:47.375 --> 01:10:51.250
Where are they? In this Brighton, how many there are?

01:10:52.417 --> 01:10:54.125
How many are here?

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.917
All right? That’s the problem.

01:10:57.500 --> 01:11:02.792
It takes time for people to love reality, time.

01:11:03.417 --> 01:11:06.458
It’s such a beautiful thing.

01:11:06.999 --> 01:11:09.709
And even they get realized, then they drop out, you see.

01:11:10.083 --> 01:11:11.917
They say, “Oh, I’m all right now. I’m all right.”

01:11:12.083 --> 01:11:14.542
After one year they’ll appear.

01:11:14.792 --> 01:11:15.917
That’s not the way.

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:19.417
You have to master this art, absolutely master it.

01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:21.917
It is all free, absolutely free,

01:11:22.083 --> 01:11:26.625
now they are all sitting down here, they can say that.

01:11:28.625 --> 01:11:31.208
Would You talk a bit more about Self-realization and

01:11:31.458 --> 01:11:34.625
and, You know, what’s necessary to enhance that?

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.959
Yes, Yes, I will be in My next lecture, one by one.

01:11:40.125 --> 01:11:42.625
Now I’m talking of the left side, the right side,

01:11:42.917 --> 01:11:46.208
and then the center, and then also, of course about the Spirit,

01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:49.166
definitely, hundred times, that’s what I have to do.

01:11:49.417 --> 01:11:52.250
But gradually I have to build you up. All right?

01:11:52.458 --> 01:11:55.291
I will definitely. You won’t believe,

01:11:56.709 --> 01:11:58.999
I think I have given five hundred lectures already

01:11:59.375 --> 01:12:01.375
in London, at least.

01:12:01.834 --> 01:12:03.250
And it doesn’t end. Every time they say,

01:12:03.458 --> 01:12:04.792
last time I spoke they said, "Mother,

01:12:04.999 --> 01:12:08.208
it was absolutely a new dimension You talked about”, you see.

01:12:08.458 --> 01:12:09.041
I don’t know.

01:12:09.250 --> 01:12:11.875
Kerry told Me first time he touched his vibrations so much

01:12:12.125 --> 01:12:15.999
with My lecture, I don’t know what I touched him so much.

01:12:16.333 --> 01:12:18.208
Yes, it’s surprising.

01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:20.166
He’s from Australia.

01:12:20.625 --> 01:12:23.083
Australians do well.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.417
Very fast work.

01:12:26.208 --> 01:12:29.125
So, all the questions are over now? Should we have it?

01:12:29.333 --> 01:12:31.083
What of Karma?

01:12:31.333 --> 01:12:32.750
Eh?

01:12:33.125 --> 01:12:38.041
Karma? Karmas are when you do any work

01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:43.333
or anything with your right side action

01:12:43.999 --> 01:12:48.750
then the effects of that accumulate within you as an ego

01:12:49.083 --> 01:12:50.375
because you think you are doing it.

01:12:50.583 --> 01:12:53.500
Actually, we don’t do anything substantial.

01:12:53.875 --> 01:12:54.999
What we do is a dead work.

01:12:55.166 --> 01:12:58.792
Like as I said we make a chair out of a dead, a tree.

01:12:58.999 --> 01:12:59.875
That’s all we do.

01:13:00.041 --> 01:13:02.709
What work we do is an idea we have we are doing work.

01:13:02.917 --> 01:13:04.041
What work are you doing?

01:13:04.250 --> 01:13:06.500
Can you convert this into a fruit?

01:13:06.959 --> 01:13:09.542
We can’t even put fragrance into it.

01:13:10.375 --> 01:13:13.250
So this myth, you see, works as ego within us

01:13:13.458 --> 01:13:16.500
as shown here, which I will be speaking tomorrow about, all right?

01:13:16.709 --> 01:13:19.375
And this is what is that we think we are doing this work,

01:13:19.583 --> 01:13:23.083
that work, and this ego thinks that

01:13:23.375 --> 01:13:27.500
if you have done bad work or good work we have to suffer.

01:13:28.083 --> 01:13:30.083
You see, a tiger doesn’t feel that way.

01:13:30.583 --> 01:13:33.583
If tiger has to eat, it must kill.

01:13:33.999 --> 01:13:36.667
It kills the animal, eats it, finished.

01:13:36.999 --> 01:13:40.208
It doesn’t sit down and sulk, “Oh, God, I should not have done it.

01:13:40.834 --> 01:13:44.834
I should become vegetarian.”

01:13:45.208 --> 01:13:50.667
It doesn’t accumulate any, any, any karmas in it, all right?

01:13:50.917 --> 01:13:52.542
But we human beings do. Why?

01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:54.458
Because we are closed.

01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:57.041
We are closed. See here, we are closed.

01:13:57.583 --> 01:13:58.667
They are open.

01:13:59.125 --> 01:14:01.000
Whatever they do, they are not bothered.

01:14:01.208 --> 01:14:05.709
But we are bothered about what we do because we think we do.

01:14:07.709 --> 01:14:14.041
And when, as I said, this center is opened out, He sucks our karmas,

01:14:14.333 --> 01:14:17.625
and the so-called karmas are nothing but sins, you see.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.166
In a biblical language we can call it as sin, you see.

01:14:21.625 --> 01:14:23.875
And they’re all sucked in

01:14:25.583 --> 01:14:30.625
by this powerful Deity of Christ awakened within us.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.542
And you get beyond it because it is the ego that does the karma.

01:14:34.792 --> 01:14:37.999
When your ego is finished, where there are the karmas?

01:14:38.333 --> 01:14:40.583
They are finished, too.

01:14:45.542 --> 01:14:47.750
Then you don’t say, “I did it.”

01:14:47.959 --> 01:14:49.083
What you will say,

01:14:49.291 --> 01:14:52.166
“Mother, it’s not working out, it’s not going up.”

01:14:52.375 --> 01:14:55.291
Now what is this 'it'? It becomes a third person.

01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:58.208
“It’s flowing. The vibrations are not coming.”

01:14:58.583 --> 01:15:01.834
You see, you don’t say, “I - I am doing this realization.

01:15:01.999 --> 01:15:04.750
I am raising the Kundalini”, they don’t say so.

01:15:04.999 --> 01:15:08.000
They say, “It’s not rising.”

01:15:08.250 --> 01:15:12.250
You become a third person. That third person is the Spirit.

01:15:12.875 --> 01:15:15.834
Where you do not say that “I should do it.”

01:15:16.208 --> 01:15:17.667
Even if it’s your son, you'll say,

01:15:17.875 --> 01:15:19.875
“Mother, it’s better he gets realization.”

01:15:20.083 --> 01:15:23.417
All right. You’ll see. Try. It doesn’t work out.

01:15:24.125 --> 01:15:26.625
All right, then should I give a certificate?

01:15:26.834 --> 01:15:29.291
He said, “How can You give certificate, Mother, how? Kundalini,

01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:32.291
Kundalini has not risen.” Everyone knows, you see,

01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:35.041
whether it’s your father, mother, sister - anyone –

01:15:35.250 --> 01:15:39.792
if they’re not realized, they know they’re not realized, so what?

01:15:39.999 --> 01:15:41.291
They just know.

01:15:42.999 --> 01:15:45.750
And this granddaughter of Mine, who was - she’s here now -

01:15:45.959 --> 01:15:47.291
she is a born realized,

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:50.166
and she was hardly about five years of age, I think,

01:15:50.375 --> 01:15:51.959
when they went to Leach.

01:15:52.208 --> 01:15:53.333
And there was one lama sitting

01:15:53.542 --> 01:15:55.959
with a shaved head and all that, wearing and all that.

01:15:56.291 --> 01:15:58.166
Everybody was touching his feet.

01:15:58.458 --> 01:16:01.375
And the parents also, not realized, My daughter is not realized,

01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:02.792
so she also touched his feet.

01:16:02.999 --> 01:16:05.500
She couldn’t bear it anymore now, it was too much for her.

01:16:05.709 --> 01:16:08.000
She was sitting in a higher block.

01:16:08.208 --> 01:16:11.667
She went, put her hands back and looked at him, turning,

01:16:11.875 --> 01:16:14.166
She says, “What do you mean by asking everybody to touch your feet?

01:16:14.375 --> 01:16:16.999
You’re not even a realized soul!

01:16:18.250 --> 01:16:21.250
By wearing this dress of yours and shaving your head

01:16:21.417 --> 01:16:23.917
you think you can ask people to touch your feet?”

01:16:24.208 --> 01:16:28.583
Little child of five years, yet she understands.

01:16:29.333 --> 01:16:31.792
We had once a program in India

01:16:31.999 --> 01:16:34.000
when they invited Me as a chief guest and

01:16:34.208 --> 01:16:36.917
for this Raman worship - was a realized soul-

01:16:37.083 --> 01:16:40.250
and one gentleman from Ramkrishna ashram, the head of that,

01:16:40.458 --> 01:16:45.999
was sitting with his big orange robe, you see, sitting there.

01:16:46.375 --> 01:16:49.500
And My, another granddaughter, she was sitting in the front row.

01:16:50.166 --> 01:16:53.166
She couldn’t bear him anymore so she shouted from there,

01:16:53.375 --> 01:16:56.792
“Mother, the one whose wearing a maxi dress,

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.458
Grandmother, please ask him to get out,

01:16:58.667 --> 01:17:00.041
he’s giving heat to all of us.”

01:17:00.250 --> 01:17:01.959
So you see, there were many sahaja yogis

01:17:02.125 --> 01:17:03.625
who were feeling the heat from the fellow

01:17:03.834 --> 01:17:05.458
and he thinks he’s a very Spiritual man.

01:17:05.667 --> 01:17:06.500
And she just stood up,

01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:09.125
she said, “Ask him to go, he is wearing a maxi.”

01:17:09.625 --> 01:17:11.458
She didn’t understand it was a robe or thing.

01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:13.667
Even children know

01:17:14.291 --> 01:17:16.208
who are realized souls and who are not,

01:17:16.875 --> 01:17:17.999
if they are born realized.

01:17:18.208 --> 01:17:20.166
There are many children who are born realized these days.

01:17:20.417 --> 01:17:24.709
The time of judgment, this is the time of judgment.

01:17:25.166 --> 01:17:27.291
Of course about this I’ll tell you later.

01:17:32.667 --> 01:17:34.709
Do You mind if I ask You a few questions?

01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:37.250
It’s all right, I don’t mind.

01:17:37.458 --> 01:17:39.291
But what happens, if you ask too many questions

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:41.792
sometimes it becomes mental activity

01:17:41.999 --> 01:17:45.083
and may delay further realization sometimes.

01:17:45.333 --> 01:17:49.041
So I would advice you, if it is not so important, better keep it out

01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:52.583
because, you see, answering the question is only on mental level.

01:17:52.792 --> 01:17:54.875
I’m talking something much beyond, you see.

01:17:55.333 --> 01:17:59.041
So, it is something logically if you have understood Me -

01:17:59.250 --> 01:18:00.542
all right, let’s have it.

01:18:00.792 --> 01:18:02.166
If it will work out, work out.

01:18:02.375 --> 01:18:03.709
If it will not work out, doesn’t matter.

01:18:03.917 --> 01:18:06.959
I’m here for three-four days, and we are going to work it out.

01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:10.667
All right? So it’s better to keep your mind at rest.

01:18:10.875 --> 01:18:14.417
Tell the mind, “You have asked many questions before,

01:18:14.625 --> 01:18:19.333
you have thought of many things, now the time for you to receive

01:18:19.542 --> 01:18:23.959
the blessings of your own being.” All right?

01:18:24.333 --> 01:18:25.709
If you tell your mind, it will rest.

01:18:25.959 --> 01:18:29.125
It’s a, it’s a wonderful thing, mind is.

01:18:29.834 --> 01:18:33.208
If the mind knows what you want,

01:18:33.834 --> 01:18:38.250
and if it is the reality, it supports you and helps you very much.

01:18:38.458 --> 01:18:40.999
The same mind which can go astray, you see,

01:18:41.208 --> 01:18:43.583
it’s like sometimes like a donkey.

01:18:43.834 --> 01:18:49.458
Like Christ used donkey just to suggest the mind

01:18:49.667 --> 01:18:54.750
that if you allow it to go astray

01:18:54.959 --> 01:18:56.583
it will take you to all kinds of things,

01:18:56.792 --> 01:19:01.625
but if you control it, it takes you there where you have to go.

01:19:02.709 --> 01:19:05.166
You just make him keep quiet.

01:19:05.375 --> 01:19:07.999
It’s better to keep quiet at mind level.

01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:10.583
And that’s why I answered your questions

01:19:10.875 --> 01:19:13.500
because later on when the Kundalini’s rising,

01:19:13.709 --> 01:19:16.083
at that time, the mind should not stand up, isn’t it,

01:19:16.291 --> 01:19:18.834
to say that “I haven’t asked this question.” That’s why.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Just to soothe it – there’s no need –

01:19:21.208 --> 01:19:24.667
but, just to soothe it down, I do it. All right?

01:19:24.999 --> 01:19:27.125
So best thing is to get your realization is the best thing,

01:19:27.333 --> 01:19:29.959
otherwise this mind is quite a disturbing stuff.

01:19:30.333 --> 01:19:31.792
It can come at the right time,

01:19:31.999 --> 01:19:36.583
when you are going to achieve your last breakthrough, it may stop.

01:19:36.834 --> 01:19:37.625
All right?

01:19:37.834 --> 01:19:39.750
So if you have any immediate question

01:19:39.959 --> 01:19:42.542
by which you are really oppressed  then you must ask Me.

01:19:42.750 --> 01:19:44.583
But if it is not so important, just give up.

01:19:45.125 --> 01:19:46.417
Is it very important?

01:19:46.875 --> 01:19:50.709
Then it’s all right. He has realized it.

01:19:50.999 --> 01:19:56.083
Now, I have to just request you one thing, if you don't mind,

01:19:56.291 --> 01:19:57.667
we have to take out our shoes,

01:19:57.875 --> 01:20:00.291
because the mother earth has such a lot, you see,

01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:03.291
so we have to take her help in every way possible.
