00:51.823 --> 01:01.735
Public Program, 26 April 1999
Levent Kırca and Oya Basar Theatre, Istanbul (Turkey)

03:18.146 --> 03:22.947
I bow to all the seekers  of truth.

03:28.908 --> 03:37.868
We are at the time bond, is very important.

03:42.311 --> 03:46.766
At this time there is so much of turmoils,

03:46.790 --> 03:50.395
so much of problems, so many wars,

03:50.472 --> 03:58.786
all kinds of interrogation has taken place in our value system.

04:12.706 --> 04:17.668
And we are quite shocked about that, very much shocked.

04:24.533 --> 04:28.652
What is the problem?

04:29.152 --> 04:32.306
Why this is happening?

04:32.403 --> 04:35.230
We should try to find out.

04:40.269 --> 04:45.852
And if there is a solution
we should try to achieve it.

04:50.891 --> 04:56.377
The problems are there because
human beings do not know themselves.

05:03.422 --> 05:07.175
Either they think too much of themselves,

05:07.200 --> 05:11.535
they have too much of Ego or
they are very much conditioned.

05:24.498 --> 05:28.212
There is no conditioning

05:28.261 --> 05:32.048
that we can say  is not troublesome,

05:41.941 --> 05:46.172
because they blindly accept all the nonsense.

05:52.943 --> 05:58.746
Now we  see the problem, say
we are born in particular religion

06:04.257 --> 06:10.242
and we just start following everything that is told to us.

06:18.156 --> 06:23.513
I ask people if they have read Quran Sharif

06:28.888 --> 06:31.397
Very few have really read

06:34.601 --> 06:39.300
and is completely, sometimes, I find is represented.

06:46.183 --> 06:50.809
That brings bad name to Islam, also to Muhammad Sahab.

07:06.772 --> 07:13.319
According to us prophet  Muhammad was a very, very great soul.

07:18.829 --> 07:28.510
We call him as Adi Guru, means one of the
primordial masters who got birth on this Earth.

07:39.307 --> 07:43.840
Now such a great soul like him would not say he is divine.

07:43.865 --> 07:48.088
I can not believe that,
but he did not say once divine.

07:54.836 --> 07:58.456
Maybe because if somebody says he is Divine,

07:58.481 --> 08:02.746
then peoplejust get  after the life of a  divine personality.

08:12.271 --> 08:16.026
And it is how much he was tortured,

08:16.083 --> 08:20.276
how much he was troubled, endless.

08:29.288 --> 08:34.059
No one may  say why should such a Divine person suffered,

08:34.117 --> 08:37.910
he did not suffered but he had sufferings

08:37.961 --> 08:41.958
even by people who were ignorant,

08:54.875 --> 08:59.534
because they were absolutely blind.

08:59.569 --> 09:04.386
They didn't  know  what sort of a great person he was.

09:13.637 --> 09:17.671
All such great saints had suffer.

09:22.172 --> 09:25.788
All over the world the saints had suffered

09:30.112 --> 09:37.758
because the people do not know what saintliness is.

09:43.290 --> 09:47.063
First of all they should know themselves.

09:51.299 --> 09:57.042
Once they know themselves,
they will know what Muhammad Sahab was.

10:05.026 --> 10:09.142
They will also know about Quran-ı Sharif
(Sharif -Holy, honorable).

10:12.907 --> 10:18.210
It is absolutely clear cut in the Qur’an,

10:18.293 --> 10:22.874
but people  want to listen the pret,
you can not help it.

10:30.829 --> 10:36.872
Christ also said that know thy self.

10:42.715 --> 10:50.321
All those, who were so great,
had told to know ourselves.

10:57.490 --> 11:01.402
Those who had not known themselves, have no right

11:01.450 --> 11:06.962
to talk about them or to condemn them
or to say horrible things.

11:20.101 --> 11:23.077
After you have come to know yourself only,

11:23.093 --> 11:26.533
you will know how great they were

11:33.628 --> 11:38.518
and how Quran Sharif is such an important book.

11:46.314 --> 11:51.498
Even those who read such a great book

11:51.523 --> 11:55.334
are doing all kinds of nonsensical things .

12:03.410 --> 12:07.023
They have no control over their greed.

12:10.385 --> 12:13.482
They have no control over their lust,

12:16.725 --> 12:19.339
they can be very cruel also.

12:21.820 --> 12:24.383
How can that be?

12:27.254 --> 12:31.398
If you read such a great book like Quran Sharif,

12:31.423 --> 12:34.694
then how can you be like that?

12:41.569 --> 12:45.603
Because  all this reading does not go in the heart.

12:50.244 --> 12:58.946
He has talked about Rahmet (mercy, clemency),
he called it Rahim (compassionate, forgiving) .

13:11.742 --> 13:14.448
Where is that Rahmet?

13:14.608 --> 13:17.436
If do you see that  anywhere?

13:21.248 --> 13:25.090
They are all killing each other in the name of God.

13:29.273 --> 13:36.793
So this is the state of the truth,
of reality, of divinity.

13:43.596 --> 13:48.153
Now what is needed is first to know thy self.

13:53.100 --> 13:59.680
For that, it is placed within you,
in the triangle bone,

14:00.590 --> 14:04.907
this special power  called as Kundalini,

14:05.259 --> 14:12.436
whether you are a Hindu, Muslim, Christian, anything.

14:19.142 --> 14:23.626
As they have a heart, they also have this power.

14:27.808 --> 14:30.942
Then how can we say we are different?

14:35.347 --> 14:38.214
We are all human begins, no doubt.

14:41.132 --> 14:46.875
But the power of the saint is in every human being.

14:51.342 --> 14:55.515
So we have to accept that we all can ascent

14:55.573 --> 14:59.067
whether we follow this religion, or that religion,

14:59.086 --> 15:02.278
or this country, or that country,
makes no difference.

15:12.797 --> 15:15.479
It's written in  Quran Sharif also

15:15.527 --> 15:18.917
it is not only my words, it is written everywhere

15:18.942 --> 15:22.766
that we all human beings are the same.

15:32.385 --> 15:35.593
If so, if that is the situation,

15:35.618 --> 15:39.818
then why  should we all not know ourselves.

15:44.697 --> 15:51.160
It is very easy to know yourself in these modern times,

15:56.428 --> 15:58.053
It has been the esteem

15:58.078 --> 16:03.315
that  in these modern times we should know ourselves.

16:11.483 --> 16:15.429
You have to have the Self knowledge.

16:22.318 --> 16:27.018
You have knowledge of everything outside
what about your Self?

16:35.426 --> 16:39.494
When you will know your Self you will be amazed

16:39.503 --> 16:46.515
that you all are part and parcel of one great personality, Upper.

16:58.162 --> 17:01.979
When we say “Allah hu Akbar
(Lord, the Biggest)”

17:02.523 --> 17:06.706
what do we say is that we are one,

17:06.731 --> 17:10.615
in one personality that is Upper.

17:23.272 --> 17:27.921
Just by think “Allah hu Akbar”, you do not realized,

17:27.957 --> 17:32.966
you do not become part and parcel of the great Upper.

17:40.731 --> 17:45.365
You go out shouting for ages, for centuries,

17:45.471 --> 17:49.927
you will not become part and parcel of Upper.

17:59.696 --> 18:03.126
For that you have to know yourself

18:03.158 --> 18:10.173
and that you have to get connected to
this all pervading Power of Ruh (Spirit).

18:21.991 --> 18:25.475
You have some Sufis,
but nobody believed them

18:25.491 --> 18:28.398
because they were realized souls.

18:37.101 --> 18:42.330
Especially in your country, you had such a great people

18:42.355 --> 18:46.489
who came to tell you that you should know yourself ,

18:54.909 --> 19:00.060
but we got lost, in these modern times
we got lost, completely.

19:06.201 --> 19:08.637
Where are we?

19:13.475 --> 19:16.662
What are we fighting for?

19:21.776 --> 19:26.950
How can blind fight,

19:30.257 --> 19:32.410
we do not  know anything,

19:32.490 --> 19:35.167
we do not know  our meaning.

19:40.404 --> 19:42.554
How is possible?

19:42.779 --> 19:48.225
It is very much possible for you all to get your

19:48.250 --> 19:53.042
self realization, self knowledge, to know yourself.

20:00.920 --> 20:05.922
Even if you are fanatics, listen to me.

20:09.595 --> 20:13.851
Because this will  save you, save your children,

20:13.922 --> 20:18.572
save everyone, save Turkey and save the whole world.

20:26.920 --> 20:31.286
You have to raise  about this limited ideas,

20:31.312 --> 20:34.256
that you get from others.

20:45.388 --> 20:49.697
You have to have a feeling,

20:49.780 --> 20:53.533
the experience of  this Ruh.

20:58.537 --> 21:05.793
Without that , you cannot know anything
about prophet Muhammad or Islam.

21:15.531 --> 21:18.490
Islam is to surrender,

21:21.482 --> 21:24.345
it doesn't mean  aggression.

21:31.508 --> 21:35.018
Surrender to who?

21:37.434 --> 21:41.356
To God, to his power,

21:41.420 --> 21:45.152
which is the power of love.

21:51.213 --> 21:53.173
God loved us,

21:53.293 --> 21:55.951
so he created us.

22:01.516 --> 22:05.844
If we haven't got that power of love,

22:05.900 --> 22:09.265
if we haven't just  his power of love ,

22:09.290 --> 22:13.459
no use during any namaz or anything no use.

22:25.354 --> 22:28.473
The namaz (daily Muslim worshiping) you do is nothing,

22:28.770 --> 22:31.650
but for your Kundalini awakening.

22:40.678 --> 22:43.281
You will realize that

22:43.306 --> 22:46.279
after your Self Knowledge,

22:46.684 --> 22:51.012
even if you do namaz it has great meaning.

23:00.314 --> 23:04.671
Once you start feeling this cool breeze

23:04.712 --> 23:07.182
after Holy Ghost as they call it,

23:07.318 --> 23:09.667
or you  can say this Ruh,

23:09.995 --> 23:16.291
then when you do namaz it goes on increasing,
you go on

23:17.501 --> 23:20.137
becoming higher and higher.

23:31.019 --> 23:35.082
Otherwise, any number of namaz can you do,

23:35.107 --> 23:38.592
rouse are you do, you can not do it.

23:48.173 --> 23:53.252
And a seed has to be sprout,

23:53.496 --> 23:55.980
otherwise it cannot grow.

24:01.895 --> 24:06.848
In the same way your Kundalini has to be awaken

24:06.873 --> 24:09.724
like a primula  of a seed.
(brightly coloured flowers in the spring)

24:16.948 --> 24:22.721
Without this sprouting,
how can you grow, artificially?

24:28.666 --> 24:34.786
So please understand that first let this sprouting things

24:41.462 --> 24:44.337
and then you do namaz,

24:44.488 --> 24:47.619
and you will be amazed that

24:47.660 --> 24:50.185
the chaitanya work on

24:50.219 --> 24:54.920
vibrations there  are flowing increase tremendously.

25:08.786 --> 25:11.926
Also then you read Qur’an

25:11.961 --> 25:16.286
and these vibrations will increase tremendously!

25:23.453 --> 25:26.508
You will grow very fast.

25:31.230 --> 25:35.301
All the things that you do in the name of God,

25:35.352 --> 25:37.986
you will have the experience

25:38.089 --> 25:41.675
that are all true, there is truth in it.

25:48.954 --> 25:54.656
But you have to allow the seed to be sprout.

25:58.455 --> 26:06.034
Without that you are just like any other  material.

26:11.563 --> 26:17.895
Something artificial living in the false world,

26:18.352 --> 26:21.463
doing all kinds of wrong things

26:21.955 --> 26:27.015
without bothering about God Almighty.

26:36.917 --> 26:38.660
Not only that you will know your Self,

26:38.685 --> 26:43.576
but you will know all the powers that
get out of that knowledge.

26:54.426 --> 27:00.690
The first power you get is of tremendously creativity.

27:06.959 --> 27:10.927
As it is Turkish are known for their  creativity,

27:17.372 --> 27:21.709
they will create  such a beautiful art

27:21.773 --> 27:27.601
that it will be appealing to the
whole world on Global level.

27:39.737 --> 27:45.427
Now you become extremely moral by nature.

27:50.427 --> 27:55.689
You do not have to be very rigid about this,

27:56.396 --> 28:00.567
you just become you become very moral.

28:09.413 --> 28:12.931
Whatever is said  “don’t do this, don’t do that!”,

28:12.963 --> 28:15.979
nothing is to be told;

28:22.609 --> 28:26.531
because your Spirit is now enlightened

28:30.293 --> 28:34.779
and in the blank of that spirit
you know what is good for you,

28:34.785 --> 28:36.700
and what is distracting for you.

28:45.260 --> 28:49.872
Now Muhammed said not to drink alcohol,

28:49.946 --> 28:52.533
we do not say do not drink ,

28:59.139 --> 29:03.750
because if I say that half of the people will just go away.

29:10.593 --> 29:14.037
But after you get this knowledge

29:14.089 --> 29:16.884
which is constructive for yourself ,

29:16.917 --> 29:19.530
you yourself do not drink,

29:19.555 --> 29:22.102
you do not take any alcohol,

29:22.136 --> 29:24.544
you do not take any drug,
you do not smoke,

29:24.592 --> 29:28.493
you do not take anything
that can destroy your body.

29:41.172 --> 29:43.712
You do not have to tell your children

29:43.737 --> 29:47.825
“do this, do that” , it works out automatically.

29:53.114 --> 29:57.621
It is very surprising how powerful you become,

29:57.671 --> 30:01.523
that you do not have to do anything

30:01.573 --> 30:05.033
to stop yourself of doing something wrong.

30:17.719 --> 30:20.703
Then you become very sensitive

30:20.738 --> 30:23.414
as to what is right and what is wrong

30:23.439 --> 30:27.113
and you just do not accept that is wrong.

30:35.394 --> 30:41.523
This discrimination  is just within you,
which is enlightened.

30:49.782 --> 30:56.587
Then for everything: for food, for

30:56.754 --> 31:01.600
taking out money, this -that, all this greed business

31:01.753 --> 31:03.856
just get controlled.

31:13.846 --> 31:19.346
Above all you become a very very loving person.

31:24.373 --> 31:28.295
You have faith in your own love

31:31.486 --> 31:34.598
and you see that your love  succeeds

31:39.877 --> 31:42.936
and you are amazed how it works.

31:46.625 --> 31:48.927
Now the time has come

31:48.975 --> 31:52.117
what you call as a last judgment.

31:56.078 --> 32:00.628
Now if you get to the right religion,

32:00.692 --> 32:05.505
if you get to the right understanding of yourself,

32:05.540 --> 32:12.367
so you should know you have decided for the highest ascent.

32:26.313 --> 32:31.146
This you will experience yourself

32:35.146 --> 32:39.996
that you have become extremely loving,

32:40.880 --> 32:43.564
kind, forgiving person.

32:50.405 --> 32:55.836
But by doing that you don't become,
don't become weak,

32:55.845 --> 32:57.987
but  you become very strong.

33:04.197 --> 33:07.565
You didn't  see despite all of position

33:07.590 --> 33:12.866
how your Sufis have  stayed

33:12.891 --> 33:15.571
that's    on their path of truth.

33:25.583 --> 33:30.228
But now you are not alone, you are not alone.

33:34.035 --> 33:37.480
You have thousands of them all over the world.

33:41.829 --> 33:45.138
They are your brothers and sisters all over.

33:49.563 --> 33:53.176
You will be amazed how they look after you.

33:56.475 --> 33:58.673
How they are bothered about you,

34:02.115 --> 34:08.210
when you become one with the all pervading akbar,

34:08.235 --> 34:10.615
then who is the other?

34:18.114 --> 34:24.228
For example, anything happens to
this finger the whole body reacts.

34:29.977 --> 34:35.629
In the same way all the Sahaja yogis,
all the people all over the world,

34:35.654 --> 34:39.458
who know themselves, will react  together

34:47.566 --> 34:52.766
and their good wishes will act
through the Divine Power.

35:00.591 --> 35:05.239
Gradually all this destructive nature

35:05.272 --> 35:11.405
and also the falsehood of people drops out.

35:21.727 --> 35:25.723
Also you develop another

35:25.748 --> 35:28.742
dimension in your awareness

35:35.054 --> 35:40.636
which is called as collective consciousness.

35:44.000 --> 35:49.826
So what you do, you can  feel
another person on your  fingertips.

35:54.199 --> 35:57.297
You can feel yourself also on your fingertips.

36:00.876 --> 36:03.701
That is what Mohamed Sahab has said,

36:03.765 --> 36:07.108
that at the time of Resurrection Kıyama

36:07.155 --> 36:09.137
your hands will speak

36:09.162 --> 36:13.410
and will give şahadet  (witness) against you.

36:28.787 --> 36:31.889
They will tell you what is wrong with you,

36:35.022 --> 36:39.847
your fingers will tell you what is wrong
with you, with your body,

36:39.872 --> 36:43.815
with your mind, everything you can know on your fingertips.

36:51.759 --> 36:55.790
Now if you know how to correct

36:56.055 --> 37:02.075
those defects in you, you can correct anybody’s problems,

37:10.706 --> 37:15.506
because you can also feel
what is wrong with them on your fingertips.

37:22.058 --> 37:25.845
Sitting down here you can feel for anybody in Ankara

37:25.870 --> 37:28.367
or maybe London or anywhere

37:34.283 --> 37:38.976
and if you know how to correct sitting down here,
you can correct that person.

37:46.673 --> 37:50.625
So, in short, is the  scientific language we will  say

37:50.690 --> 37:54.138
that you enter into the subtler side, the

37:54.163 --> 37:57.759
the subtle of subtlest of Ether.

38:08.026 --> 38:13.505
As your chakras get enlightened,
you enter into the subtler side

38:13.530 --> 38:16.804
of all the five elements.

38:28.903 --> 38:34.263
Ultimately the sixth center,
as they call it Agnya chakra,

38:34.288 --> 38:38.243
is once it is  enlightened,

38:38.267 --> 38:42.076
then you become extremely forgiving.

38:52.635 --> 38:55.095
You do not react,

38:57.563 --> 39:00.306
you watch everything like a witness.

39:03.971 --> 39:07.711
Certainly now I see this carpet is very well made,

39:07.743 --> 39:10.380
so normally I should  react.

39:16.030 --> 39:19.598
How much it was have cost from
where did you that buy

39:19.624 --> 39:22.523
who has made it, all these questions will come.

39:29.872 --> 39:32.956
But after the Self Realization

39:32.968 --> 39:36.016
you just watch and enjoy

39:36.041 --> 39:40.147
the creativity of the artist who has made this.

39:50.981 --> 39:54.330
Your quarreling nature also subsides,

40:00.368 --> 40:02.950
because you do not react.

40:06.963 --> 40:12.716
To the last of is  this limbic  area where Kundalini arise

40:12.759 --> 40:18.983
by which you get your peace and joy.

40:32.441 --> 40:36.623
Now Joy is a singular thing,

40:41.911 --> 40:44.823
it is not happiness and unhappiness.

40:48.354 --> 40:50.465
It is just  joy

40:52.277 --> 40:55.705
that means you rises  above your thoughts,

40:55.730 --> 41:01.299
above your mind and you are in complete peace.

41:07.892 --> 41:15.556
For example if you are standing

41:15.618 --> 41:19.651
in the water and the waves are there,
you are  afraid of it.

41:25.898 --> 41:27.762
But in case,

41:27.818 --> 41:31.891
in case , you get into a water,

41:31.941 --> 41:38.184
then you can watch, you can watch  the waves

41:38.242 --> 41:40.583
and enjoy them.

41:49.614 --> 41:53.535
But supposing you know swimming ,

41:53.575 --> 41:56.971
you can jump and save many others.

42:04.636 --> 42:10.039
So now Sahaja yoga is  working
in eighty countries  in the whole world.

42:15.303 --> 42:17.842
and in a very big way.

42:20.468 --> 42:23.355
Some people who got their self realisation

42:23.380 --> 42:26.644
went around and give realization at to others.

42:31.431 --> 42:33.812
For that you do not have to pay

42:36.488 --> 42:39.649
It's a natural process, living process

42:39.751 --> 42:42.116
How much would you pay for that?

42:49.045 --> 42:52.562
So it was without any payment,

42:57.539 --> 43:01.092
that's how the falsehood can be exposed

43:05.695 --> 43:08.456
because you pay for all kinds of falsehood.

43:12.352 --> 43:15.462
Now you can say who has pay for this all.

43:15.487 --> 43:18.560
I must  say  the Sahaja yogis have paid.

43:26.388 --> 43:29.413
Formally I used to pay,

43:31.975 --> 43:34.774
because I have money from my  family

43:34.799 --> 43:36.241
also from my husband.

43:40.285 --> 43:42.127
Now they want to pay.

43:43.779 --> 43:46.663
They  think  for our self realization ,

43:46.688 --> 43:50.306
you are taking this hall, Mother why you should pay?

43:59.489 --> 44:05.567
They can pay for the hall but not for  self realisation.

44:13.266 --> 44:17.038
Then the last center is broken,the seventh One

44:17.071 --> 44:21.183
by which we get connected with this all pervading power.

44:30.502 --> 44:36.632
Which we have not felt so far.
the presence of this all pervading power.

44:42.878 --> 44:51.444
But after self realization you feel it,
this cool breeze, the Ruh (spirit).

44:58.798 --> 45:03.085
In the beginning if very hot,

45:07.022 --> 45:10.637
for that you have to forgive everyone,

45:11.484 --> 45:14.602
not to have anger for anyone.

45:20.876 --> 45:23.240
and it works very easily.

45:26.650 --> 45:31.183
I know there are people here
who want to ask me questions also.

45:35.706 --> 45:39.914
Just now make your questioning mind quite.

45:44.350 --> 45:47.142
First get your self realisation

45:49.988 --> 45:52.400
and then you can ask.

45:54.858 --> 46:00.076
You have to feel this cool breeze on your fingertips.

46:05.408 --> 46:08.169
So have faith in yourself.

46:10.115 --> 46:12.833
And you all  can feel this ruh (spirit).

46:15.504 --> 46:18.108
I assure you ,you can.

46:23.350 --> 46:27.297
[UNCLEAR] hardly five to ten minutes.

46:31.024 --> 46:32.978
I will work it out.

46:36.041 --> 46:39.906
I will request who want to go away ,can go away,

46:39.922 --> 46:41.868
don't disturb others.

46:48.631 --> 46:50.773
I can not force  it only.

46:54.083 --> 46:55.789
You have to ask for it.

47:00.481 --> 47:05.286
If you want to have it,  you can get.

47:09.220 --> 47:12.013
You must have the desire to have it ,

47:17.227 --> 47:19.560
because is pure desire that works.

47:25.670 --> 47:29.824
There is no competition,
no trouble, nothing at all.

47:37.493 --> 47:42.182
Only thing you have to take out your shoes.

47:46.755 --> 47:50.027
Because this Mother Earth is very pure

47:53.529 --> 47:55.531
and she is very helpful.

48:03.124 --> 48:06.838
Can you  wait, Can you wait for a while?

48:10.261 --> 48:11.959
You can do it little later.

48:15.204 --> 48:17.370
Don't disturb this attention

48:21.048 --> 48:22.476
for a while.

48:39.179 --> 48:43.790
I am not going to tell you to do anything whatsoever

48:43.821 --> 48:47.435
I will not even say do not think but automatically

48:47.492 --> 48:50.587
you will  go beyond your mind

48:58.719 --> 49:02.385
and see then said this torsion area.

49:02.428 --> 49:05.253
is called it torsion area.

49:17.833 --> 49:24.747
Alright, Now we have to do like this,
like we do for namaz that's all.

49:30.007 --> 49:31.584
Be comfortable.

49:33.116 --> 49:37.220
Take off your shoes and put both
the  feet away to  each other.

49:47.552 --> 49:55.300
Now  put your right hand on your heart

50:02.745 --> 50:07.653
and ask for forgiveness from God almighty

50:07.678 --> 50:12.029
if we have done anything wrong ,
just to  ask forgive from heart.

50:20.384 --> 50:22.741
But don't  feel guilty.

50:25.445 --> 50:27.373
Mistake can be done

50:27.398 --> 50:29.819
and  now you ask for forgivness,

50:29.827 --> 50:32.765
so do not feel guilty at all

50:36.706 --> 50:45.053
If you feel guilty then this center
on the left hand gets bothered.

50:50.470 --> 50:54.226
And who it is just like
and we are not then coming.

51:08.332 --> 51:14.351
Now please put your right hand  towards me

51:14.449 --> 51:18.389
and put down your head
and see for yourself

51:18.413 --> 51:23.933
is there  any cool or hot breeze
coming out  your head.

51:45.965 --> 51:51.896
Now If  it is hot then you have to forgive,
forgive everyone.

51:57.740 --> 52:01.536
Now please down put
your left hand towards me,

52:01.584 --> 52:04.349
put down your head
and see for yourself

52:04.374 --> 52:09.771
if  there is a cool or  hot  breeze
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

52:24.283 --> 52:28.455
Now please put both
your hands towards me.

52:32.022 --> 52:40.766
Please ,see now if there is a your feeling
the  cool breeze on your fingertips

52:40.791 --> 52:46.470
or on your palm or out of your
fontanel area. Just see it.

52:58.280 --> 53:00.645
This is the ruh.

53:01.988 --> 53:09.533
You can ask a question in your heart ,
is this the ruh  the Divine power?

53:16.713 --> 53:22.714
By asking this ,you will get more  coming [UNCLEAR]

53:28.435 --> 53:31.473
so you can say  also yes this is the ruh

53:31.514 --> 53:35.243
We  have never tried this before ,
this is the ruh.

53:42.648 --> 53:46.923
So you will  feel it warm.

53:50.045 --> 53:53.330
Although who have felt

53:53.858 --> 53:57.756
this cool breeze on their  fingertips,

53:57.853 --> 54:02.198
or on their palm or out of them  fontanel  bone area,

54:02.286 --> 54:04.508
please raise your hands , both hands.

54:17.637 --> 54:20.637
That is what Turkish  people are  wonderful.

54:20.662 --> 54:22.035
May God bless you.

54:25.791 --> 54:29.143
You are specially best people I must say

54:29.265 --> 54:33.491
so easy  to give realisation too.

54:37.321 --> 54:39.121
There is something special.

54:41.858 --> 54:44.954
With the  Europeans  have to break my hands

54:48.567 --> 54:49.956
not with you people.

54:51.797 --> 54:53.581
You are very kind

54:55.129 --> 54:56.512
and sensible,

54:58.489 --> 55:00.306
so may God bless you all.

55:16.875 --> 55:19.255
They want to sing a song for you

55:19.280 --> 55:21.455
and you just clap,all right?

55:21.487 --> 55:25.181
So and you will be amazed ,
this will increase.

55:50.631 --> 55:54.363
Those who have not  felt anything
can come here

55:54.387 --> 55:56.404
and we work it out on them.
