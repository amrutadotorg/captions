WEBVTT

04:34.327 --> 04:38.597
We have gathered here on the occassion of Ram Navami

04:38.607 --> 04:40.657
everybody has said

04:40.667 --> 04:46.567
Mother please tell us about Shri Ram

04:46.577 --> 04:55.627
As you know that Shri Rama has taken
a very important place in our chakras

04:55.637 --> 05:02.967
He is sitting on our right heart

05:02.977 --> 05:10.867
Shri Rama has taken a place of a father

05:10.877 --> 05:26.804
so lack of father's duty and love
can cause a catch of this chakra

05:29.247 --> 05:34.470
In Sahaja Yoga we can understand
that Rama and all other gods

05:34.537 --> 05:41.397
came on earth with different power (shakti),

05:41.407 --> 05:49.487
they came to do their jobs

05:49.528 --> 05:54.313
In the sense Shri Rama has a special job

05:56.827 --> 06:02.687
Socrates has said
benevolent king has to come

06:02.697 --> 06:07.169
For that Shri Rama came

06:08.427 --> 06:13.307
Shri Rama came in complete human form

06:13.317 --> 06:16.657
He even forgot that

06:16.667 --> 06:21.367
he is a incarnation of Shri Vishnu
He was made to be forgotten

06:21.377 --> 06:31.377
But he was Purushottam on earth
(perfect human being)

06:31.387 --> 06:40.107
you all must have heard of
his qualities and his childhood

06:40.117 --> 06:47.643
In Sahaja yoga
when we worship any god

06:49.337 --> 07:02.757
what quality we gain from them

07:02.767 --> 07:06.397
which qualities we will receive?

07:06.407 --> 07:08.857
Shri Rama has many

07:08.867 --> 07:19.867
One that he was ideal
another that he is a king

07:19.877 --> 07:24.987
he kept his people higher than himself

07:24.997 --> 07:29.957
than his wife and children

07:29.967 --> 07:38.247
If politicians today

07:38.257 --> 07:42.797
understand this point

07:42.807 --> 07:46.897
they wouldn't be called selfish

07:46.907 --> 07:49.087
they wouldn't be selfish

07:49.097 --> 07:51.437
would be follower of Dharma.

07:51.447 --> 07:53.677
Nobody has followed

07:53.687 --> 08:00.677
Shri Rama as a role model
till today

08:00.687 --> 08:03.637
By singing his bhajans

08:03.647 --> 08:10.858
or building an institutions and temples
in his name

08:11.191 --> 08:16.337
Shri Rama come to you?

08:16.347 --> 08:20.077
Do you get his light in your life?

08:20.134 --> 08:29.373
Only sahaj yogi can bring the light
of Shri Rama into the attention

08:31.104 --> 08:34.263
He is totally beyond

08:34.297 --> 08:39.062
Basically all the deities are
free from papas and punyas

08:39.087 --> 08:45.242
so called sins
they never sin

08:45.252 --> 08:48.602
Shri Krishna killed many people

08:48.729 --> 08:52.890
Shri Rama killed Ravana

08:52.900 --> 08:57.852
It can be a sin in worldly sense

08:57.877 --> 09:00.962
but not in the eyes of god

09:01.264 --> 09:13.197
As they destroy and remove evils
they have rights to do anything

09:13.222 --> 09:21.307
When Devi slayed Rakshas
she has committed a sin?

09:21.317 --> 09:30.856
Their work is to destroy the
rakshas and protect the saints

09:33.727 --> 09:42.422
In Shri Rama's life Ahilya's saving is
the most important

09:42.422 --> 09:46.293
she was cursed by her husband

09:46.910 --> 09:51.859
In those times if any women
goes out of dharma

09:51.884 --> 09:58.172
and if her husband is high saint
he could curse

09:59.522 --> 10:04.032
But Ahillya was blamed falsely

10:04.064 --> 10:09.438
And she was made into stone falsely

10:09.717 --> 10:14.667
So shri Rama saved Ahilya

10:14.677 --> 10:27.736
Especially his quality to have only one wife

10:28.220 --> 10:33.060
his love to one wife must be understood

10:34.687 --> 10:41.142
Even though he knew Sitaji is Mahalaxmi
she herself is a Goddess

10:41.142 --> 10:50.702
But as a Human he never looked
at any other women but his wife

10:50.727 --> 10:56.226
When we talk about Rama
we should have the husband pure

10:56.464 --> 11:00.390
To worships shri Rama

11:00.663 --> 11:10.782
Women should have the same faith
in husbands as Sitaji used to

11:10.888 --> 11:17.060
Husbands also need the quality of Shri Ram
who believed one wife

11:17.085 --> 11:20.012
Not difficult for sahaja yogis

11:20.037 --> 11:24.987
Women should be respected
Have respect for wifes

11:24.997 --> 11:28.997
When Ravana kidnapped Sitaji

11:29.007 --> 11:34.662
Shri Rama felt his duty
to rescue her

11:34.662 --> 11:42.287
But in his kingdom
he was so just that

11:42.297 --> 11:48.627
For people he left her
after spending so many years to rescue

11:48.637 --> 11:54.777
As Sitaji herself a Devi
so there's no effect

11:54.787 --> 11:58.663
So Shri Rama did it

11:58.742 --> 12:05.184
to keep the benevolence
of public opinion

12:05.303 --> 12:09.297
that society wouln't accpect the women

12:09.322 --> 12:15.287
who are questioned.

12:16.374 --> 12:21.745
Although she is a Devi
Pure and Nirmala

12:21.770 --> 12:26.173
Later that
Sita also left him somehow

12:26.377 --> 12:32.872
She left him as a woman
and Shri Rama as a man

12:32.897 --> 12:41.191
Sitaji disappeared into the mother earth
and Shri Rama went into River Sarayu

12:41.510 --> 12:48.275
Their life is very eventful
and full of Miracles

12:48.442 --> 12:57.774
You see how shri Sita and Rama
have good attitude and are faithful each other

12:57.807 --> 13:03.852
Even if she was left
Sita thought it her duty

13:03.852 --> 13:09.942
She never complained
or talked ill of him

13:09.967 --> 13:16.424
And effortlessly
she has raised her children

13:17.152 --> 13:22.589
Shri Rama's children are
called Luv and Kush

13:22.632 --> 13:31.491
They came as devotees
and we can see them as disciples

13:31.687 --> 13:34.727
They represents Shisya (disciples)

13:34.737 --> 13:42.727
the power of Shisya
so we can be disciple of someone

13:42.737 --> 13:48.757
As disciples they learned archery
when they were small

13:48.767 --> 13:56.175
And learned Ramayana
and got proficiency in the music

13:56.547 --> 14:04.072
Showing the disciples must surrender completely
to the Guru

14:04.082 --> 14:08.702
We also have a disciples in us

14:08.727 --> 14:16.185
They were  completely surrendered to
the Mother who is Shakti

14:16.467 --> 14:22.137
Even they were about to fight
against Shri Rama

14:22.162 --> 14:25.637
they kept Mother highest in the world

14:25.637 --> 14:32.307
The mother cared them
and made them completely dharmic

14:32.317 --> 14:35.227
It was her first duty

14:35.237 --> 14:40.287
Not like today wives just cry
"my husband left me"

14:40.297 --> 14:46.280
But with husband they fight always
and if he leaves they will cry

14:46.467 --> 14:55.074
He has left no problem
I have children, I will care for them

14:55.107 --> 15:00.067
they will get all they need

15:00.077 --> 15:09.847
Sitaj's life was special
with bravery and strength

15:09.857 --> 15:12.767
Every woman must have it

15:12.777 --> 15:17.837
Even if you are separated with your
husband or far away

15:17.847 --> 15:25.637
there shouldn't be any loss
or shortage for children

15:25.782 --> 15:31.310
Because her duty
is the most important thing

15:31.507 --> 15:34.655
We shouldn't give up
most important thing

15:34.841 --> 15:41.412
In sahaja yoga
all women should get this power

15:42.207 --> 15:46.607
Shri Rama's life was
very pure and Nirmal

15:46.617 --> 15:49.677
he gave up everything
for his wife

15:50.597 --> 16:01.957
His wife had gone, he had to live alone
and he had to leave her

16:01.967 --> 16:06.317
He gave up all the comforts of the life

16:06.327 --> 16:13.517
You know he used to sleep
on grass, on floor and walked barefeet

16:13.527 --> 16:17.113
and wear clothes like saints

16:17.917 --> 16:20.887
All these are not stories
it's a fact

16:20.897 --> 16:28.987
In India many people used to have
high standard life

16:28.997 --> 16:32.807
and they have never thought about
small and low level things

16:32.817 --> 16:41.903
But all these ideals of our country
have beccome fake

16:41.928 --> 16:48.722
By singing bhajans to Ram
we think we are done

16:48.722 --> 16:51.852
we have got a kind of hypocracy

16:52.138 --> 16:55.684
In countries without
these ideals

16:55.709 --> 17:01.052
people try to become the ideals
correcting themselves

17:01.108 --> 17:05.843
If you have the ideal in front of us

17:05.897 --> 17:10.197
you don't  become Shri Rama or Krishna

17:10.207 --> 17:12.737
or you have anything to do with them

17:12.747 --> 17:15.067
We feel like that

17:15.077 --> 17:21.690
But if we have Shri Rama inside
his light can be in our attention

17:21.745 --> 17:24.785
Let's understand

17:24.944 --> 17:31.328
the circumstances when
Shri Rama came on earth

17:31.456 --> 17:33.950
Sahaja Yogi must understand

17:33.983 --> 17:43.957
If we get Shri Rama's state
All our political problems will go

17:43.967 --> 17:49.040
when we decide to
become like shri Rama

18:04.530 --> 18:08.257
Then everyone becomes good

18:08.267 --> 18:19.787
firstly dharma, success and education
then the ideals

18:19.797 --> 18:26.927
for that he made his life very idealistic

18:26.937 --> 18:33.907
When someone tells you something
but he doesn't do it himself

18:33.917 --> 18:38.489
Then how can you trust him and get his quality

18:38.529 --> 18:42.747
There are many people who say
we believe in this and that

18:42.757 --> 18:45.717
But they are opposite

18:45.727 --> 18:54.651
Followers of Ram seems to be the biggest fraud politician
and they have many wives, impossible

18:55.057 --> 19:00.347
What is the duty of Sahaja Yogis' life?

19:00.497 --> 19:05.828
we have to bring the light of god
in our attention

19:06.146 --> 19:11.512
We must see and behave as Shri Rama

19:11.830 --> 19:19.155
What would Shri Rama or Sita do
in this situation

19:19.165 --> 19:24.832
What would Sita ji say?

19:24.857 --> 19:29.111
How would Sita behave?
She is also Gruhlaxmi

19:29.222 --> 19:34.737
As you know Sitaji took many births

19:34.747 --> 19:41.307
Gruhlaxmi was in the form of Fatima-bi

19:41.332 --> 19:48.492
She was humbly in the house but all
dharma was done by her power

19:48.492 --> 19:54.802
Not necessary for her to go out
and give big lectures

19:54.827 --> 20:04.687
You can do that work at home
with children relatives and friends

20:04.712 --> 20:09.577
you can spread sahaja Yoga at the house

20:09.577 --> 20:13.807
After getting all of it
you can go out to society

20:13.817 --> 20:24.297
But ladies have to have purity like Sitaji first

20:24.307 --> 20:28.557
First thing of the purity is
motherhood and love

20:28.567 --> 20:35.187
When she was in exile never complained
that my husband doesn't earn

20:35.197 --> 20:40.402
He doesn't do this
he doesn't buy this and that

20:40.402 --> 20:45.457
If he is in jungle so I am
What he will eat I wil

20:45.482 --> 20:50.264
I don't eat before him
I serve him first

20:50.414 --> 20:54.628
and  brother in law then I will eat

20:54.708 --> 21:08.707
Nowadays women think there is
much pressure of the work But it is not

21:09.105 --> 21:15.663
A woman is like earth element
she can absorb

21:15.894 --> 21:20.609
So many are given by the earth

21:20.634 --> 21:25.417
In the same way
women are like the earth

21:25.442 --> 21:30.468
We have got so many powers
that we can take everything inside

21:30.548 --> 21:36.849
and shower the rain of love
God has given us the power

21:36.888 --> 21:46.799
For example this fan is moving
Which one is greater, the power or fan?

21:48.457 --> 21:55.187
If you think fan is greater as  it's moving
Then it's wrong

21:55.187 --> 21:59.527
Women are ocean of shakti

21:59.552 --> 22:04.402
With that support Men does their work

22:04.427 --> 22:11.666
They are potential and kinetic
Women are potential and men are kinetic

22:11.769 --> 22:16.982
But if you start running like them

22:16.982 --> 22:20.332
It's not good
No need for women

22:20.357 --> 22:30.013
Each one is unique but equally important
But women can be good for both

22:30.093 --> 22:34.652
When the time comes
women can be more productive

22:34.677 --> 22:41.187
In Maharashtra
there was a 17-year-old widow named Tarabai

22:41.197 --> 22:45.597
She was the daughter-in-law of Shivaji

22:45.607 --> 22:50.027
Only she could defeat Aurangzeb

22:50.037 --> 22:53.132
Her grave was built

22:53.132 --> 23:06.746
You must understand women can keep all her
power within her to become ferocious

23:06.868 --> 23:19.167
But  if she waste her powers in
fighting, arguing, complaining or in frivolous things

23:19.177 --> 23:22.297
then her power would be gone

23:22.307 --> 23:30.597
Women are so powerful that
she can work more than men if she want

23:30.607 --> 23:34.074
But first of all
she must respect her powers

23:34.091 --> 23:40.260
by scattering and wasting she becomes powerless

23:40.292 --> 23:42.911
this kind of woman is not good

23:43.125 --> 23:50.171
Women's job is very important and full of dignity

23:50.290 --> 23:54.858
Women should be very modest and very wise

23:54.962 --> 23:59.752
Let Men use bad words but women cannot

23:59.949 --> 24:06.416
Men can argue and would fight
let them do but not Women

24:06.456 --> 24:14.440
Their job is to make peace, protection and helping people

24:14.781 --> 24:22.127
She is like shield not like sword
and sword cannot be shield

24:22.137 --> 24:29.077
Shield is greater than sword
as shield can bear the sword

24:29.102 --> 24:33.547
Sword can be broken
but not shield

24:33.547 --> 24:42.167
So her most important power is humility

24:42.177 --> 24:46.177
With humility comes all the powers

24:46.187 --> 24:51.007
It's not difficult for sahaj yogis
not at all

24:51.017 --> 24:55.077
I see many sahaja yoginis chat a lot

24:55.087 --> 24:58.777
anywhere they will chat with men

24:58.787 --> 25:03.067
"Mother help me" "what happened"

25:03.077 --> 25:07.627
"The lady talks a lot please help me"

25:07.637 --> 25:10.552
"I am tired of her"

25:10.562 --> 25:15.808
There isn't much to talk with men
What's the need?

25:16.048 --> 25:19.410
Among women also

25:19.510 --> 25:25.072
In sahaja yoga men study more

25:25.072 --> 25:27.432
About Sahaja Yoga and the chakras

25:27.457 --> 25:35.327
Which chakra is driving people and is catching?

25:35.337 --> 25:39.217
Man knows all
women would be left behind

25:39.227 --> 25:41.129
Women must learn

25:41.279 --> 25:47.692
For men Shri Rama is our ideal

25:47.717 --> 25:53.392
In this sense Muslims are amazing

25:53.397 --> 25:56.822
I don't want to say bad things

25:56.847 --> 26:03.507
Say if you go to Riyad
no  Muslim will see you

26:03.517 --> 26:08.137
they will respect women
If women are crossing the street

26:08.147 --> 26:12.307
they will stop the car
respecting women

26:12.317 --> 26:17.177
But here it's opposite
I don't know why

26:17.187 --> 26:21.737
we see women with some intention

26:21.747 --> 26:26.827
Seeing every woman
they will break the neck

26:26.837 --> 26:31.347
It's a big sin to see every woman

26:31.366 --> 26:35.246
In sahaja yoga it's prohibited completely

26:35.271 --> 26:40.542
Firstly you will spoil your eyes and Sahaja Yoga

26:40.567 --> 26:45.587
Otherwise you may become blind

26:45.597 --> 26:49.697
Sometimes I see people have wandering eyes

26:49.722 --> 26:54.072
While talking eyes are wandering
women too

26:54.097 --> 26:59.387
The biggest loss is your attention

26:59.397 --> 27:02.627
Your attention goes here and there

27:02.652 --> 27:07.012
then what's the use of self-realization

27:07.022 --> 27:13.347
Without concentration Chitta can't be active

27:13.357 --> 27:18.537
Concentration must be obtained

27:18.570 --> 27:23.210
In the west the disease is
more common among men

27:23.242 --> 27:29.142
Western yogis are not alike
They know it's bad

27:29.247 --> 27:33.257
They asked me the solution

27:33.267 --> 27:42.772
Look at only ground and up to 3 feets
you don't have to see above

27:42.797 --> 27:51.167
Look at the ground
Yogis are walking looking at the ground abroad

27:51.177 --> 28:01.337
You see all good things, flowers and children
Nothing to see above

28:01.347 --> 28:04.877
So, that's how you should control your chitta

28:04.877 --> 28:10.737
Shri Rama didn't need it
If you have a respect to shri Rama

28:10.762 --> 28:15.462
You must control your chitta like him

28:15.487 --> 28:26.735
Tell your wife you respect her as shakti
But she has to deserve it

28:26.845 --> 28:31.112
"Yatr naryan pujante tatr ramante devata"

28:31.137 --> 28:41.951
"Where women are respected resides
god" But they have to be respectable

28:42.237 --> 28:45.745
Please sit down

28:45.959 --> 28:50.737
Don't move during Puja

28:50.737 --> 28:56.477
If the woman is worshipable
"Pujyante" means "worshipable"

28:56.477 --> 29:04.627
Who like to worship a bad woman
cruel Rakshasi?

29:04.627 --> 29:11.987
Those who are worshpable should be worshipped
There resides gods

29:11.987 --> 29:16.893
Firstly they are mothers of children

29:16.918 --> 29:21.941
If husband scolds wife in front of children

29:21.977 --> 29:26.497
then children will never respect mother

29:26.522 --> 29:30.632
It's prime minister and deputy minister

29:30.657 --> 29:33.717
Women shouldn't insult her husband too

29:33.717 --> 29:41.667
Power goes to children from father

29:41.707 --> 29:50.124
Without this basic understanding
they fight to take control

29:50.202 --> 29:54.647
If woman knows handling of man
there won't be any fights

29:54.672 --> 30:00.927
Handling men is very easy
as they are just like children

30:00.927 --> 30:06.612
they are innocent like children

30:06.612 --> 30:10.252
By talking nonsense
you can't handle them

30:10.277 --> 30:13.521
You must forgive them as children

30:13.732 --> 30:17.312
If they fight outside
they get troubled

30:17.337 --> 30:20.777
They can get angry only to wife

30:20.802 --> 30:23.862
Getting angry at home is OK

30:23.887 --> 30:33.024
Until you get this feeling, you cannot have
mutual understanding, love and joy

30:33.199 --> 30:39.119
Men also should care for wife's needs

30:39.144 --> 30:51.102
if wife is wrong, husband has duty to say no
"It's wrong, I won't do this"

30:51.102 --> 30:57.522
But no need to fight on small things
It doesn't look good as sahaja yogis

30:57.547 --> 31:01.277
I am surprised that
Sahaja couples fight each other

31:01.277 --> 31:07.207
They come to complain about each other

31:07.232 --> 31:16.432
How come sahaja couple cannot be together peacefully
while I'm talking about peace to the whole world

31:16.457 --> 31:19.717
It won't work out if you are fighting like that

31:19.717 --> 31:27.876
Husband has to have complete
understanding of his wife first

31:27.947 --> 31:36.527
And know that all the other women
are like your sisters and mothers

31:36.552 --> 31:41.332
If someone is not clean even after Sahaja Yoga
then there's no way out

31:41.332 --> 31:46.362
There was a swiss man
not a Sahaja Yogi

31:46.362 --> 31:52.267
Not Indian
He was a father of a Sahaja Yogini

31:52.267 --> 31:59.112
Girl's husband had wandering
eyes but came to sahaja yoga

31:59.137 --> 32:07.135
They both came to Sahaja Yoga
The girl is very good but he went on doing it

32:07.254 --> 32:12.437
The non-yogi father told her to leave him

32:12.437 --> 32:18.797
"Even after sahaja yoga if he can't be cleansed
then leave him"

32:18.797 --> 32:26.937
"He is not a Sahaja Yogi don't relate with him"

32:26.947 --> 32:35.977
Even Non-Sahaja Yogi can understand
that the person can't be cleansed

32:35.977 --> 32:42.787
He doesn't have stable attention
then it is bad

32:42.787 --> 32:50.347
Our culture is that men and women
must be brother and sister

32:50.347 --> 32:57.307
But I see a talkative woman
just go to talk to men

32:57.307 --> 33:06.017
I don't understand it
They don't sit with other ladies but with men

33:06.017 --> 33:11.692
Same with men just start chatting with women

33:11.692 --> 33:21.862
Even with maid or anyone
just start talking, no self-esteem

33:21.887 --> 33:29.307
We think it's masculinity but Shri Rama is
the perfect man who is highest

33:29.317 --> 33:35.307
But the one at the bottom
think they are perfect

33:35.307 --> 33:40.587
Where is perfection?
Not believing in Shri Rama but in devil

33:40.597 --> 33:44.237
If you believe in Shri Rama
follow his ideal

33:44.237 --> 33:49.673
Therefore children and women
are getting spoiled

33:49.712 --> 33:55.187
But still Indian women maintained
good culture here

33:55.187 --> 34:05.007
If they were like Americans what it would have been
Men are fixed in terrible condition there

34:05.007 --> 34:18.607
After 2-3 marriages Men becomes
bunkrupt but women make a palace

34:18.607 --> 34:22.637
It's bad in America
Children are running away from home

34:22.637 --> 34:31.777
Indian woman manage their house
husband and children

34:31.777 --> 34:37.652
But it's changing
They think the same like husbands

34:37.677 --> 34:43.077
If he runs away with 10 women
then we go with 15 men

34:43.077 --> 34:48.927
If he is going to hell then I go before him

34:48.927 --> 34:54.262
Women shouldn't do it
The base of dharma is in woman's hand

34:54.262 --> 35:01.882
Woman must manage husband dharmic
making him understand

35:01.907 --> 35:07.484
This is the biggest duty and power
of woman to be Dharmaic

35:07.509 --> 35:15.147
Biggest dharma is forgiveness
Without it nothing works out

35:15.147 --> 35:20.397
First thing she must have forgiveness
Forgive children, husband

35:20.397 --> 35:24.857
give refuge to house servants
all are her duty

35:24.882 --> 35:35.478
This is the work that Shri Rama couldn't do
neither Shri Krishna nor Shri Jesus

35:35.670 --> 35:48.647
Rama would have killed everyone
who is useless, adharmic and flirt

35:48.647 --> 35:52.057
Don't know how many he would be finished

35:52.057 --> 35:57.667
Krishna would use his sudarshan
chakra and there would be a battle

35:57.677 --> 36:00.902
Christ would crucify himself

36:00.902 --> 36:07.172
One crucifiction is better than everyday

36:07.197 --> 36:13.327
Only Mother can do this work
With such a power of love

36:13.327 --> 36:17.900
Anything can be worked out with her power of love

36:17.932 --> 36:24.557
She holds everything with so much love
that children don't mind correcting

36:24.557 --> 36:31.997
For instance when trouble comes only mother
knows how to handle it and scold later

36:31.997 --> 36:37.217
Because children understands mother's love
and it is for them

36:37.217 --> 36:44.927
With father children may react
but not with mother's love without expectation

36:44.927 --> 36:54.062
She doesn't want anything but her children to be good
and get all my powers, all good in me

36:54.062 --> 36:59.122
If mother feels it children will be fine

36:59.147 --> 37:06.597
But some mothers are very interfering
and get involved in everything

37:06.597 --> 37:10.927
She comes always in front
while husband is at the back

37:10.937 --> 37:13.927
Children will be spoiled by it

37:13.927 --> 37:22.000
Under such harmful environment children
can be very emotional

37:22.000 --> 37:27.152
So woman should be behind
and make her husband in front

37:27.177 --> 37:31.837
Whatever husbands do
wifes must help him behind

37:31.837 --> 37:41.227
The source of his power is wife
Then how pure and hard-working she should be

37:41.227 --> 37:48.057
I put everything on woman
because I know you have great powers inside

37:48.067 --> 37:53.047
Look at me as a Mother
I must make everyone saints

37:53.047 --> 37:57.977
Curing many diseases
to make people saints

37:57.977 --> 38:03.127
Did anyone do this job?
Only Ahilya was saved

38:03.127 --> 38:06.392
Jesus saved 21 people

38:06.392 --> 38:09.672
I must have saved 21000 now

38:09.697 --> 38:14.702
Going around the world to do
everyone's job

38:14.702 --> 38:21.392
it's still going on but I don't feel
because of love

38:21.417 --> 38:28.437
Maybe I should put bandhan
as I don't know what kind of people I meet

38:28.437 --> 38:32.917
But as soon as people comes to me
I absorb all the problems

38:32.917 --> 38:40.442
So love acts by itself
I know everything is done by love

38:40.467 --> 38:47.420
I don't feel bad whatever happens
Only Mother can bear the pain

38:47.579 --> 38:55.997
So I want you to grow consistantly
without hurdles

38:56.007 --> 39:04.457
Also men should help their wives fully
Understand and respect them

39:04.467 --> 39:13.768
Until the 2 wheels gets balanced
the chariot doesn't go forward

39:15.067 --> 39:21.582
They both should be the same but
one on the left and the other on the right

39:22.047 --> 39:26.467
It won't work if you change it

39:26.467 --> 39:39.892
It is moving and working
because they are the same but unique

39:39.917 --> 39:54.867
Same in the sense of height
length and width but they work differently

39:54.867 --> 39:59.917
It's the same in our life

39:59.917 --> 40:11.897
Shri Rama didn't think
only about husband and wife

40:11.897 --> 40:17.587
Didn't think only about children and family

40:17.587 --> 40:26.602
Also of brother, sister, mother, father
and everyone as a normal human being

40:26.602 --> 40:33.152
After he thought about society

40:33.177 --> 40:39.337
About public, state and country

40:39.337 --> 40:50.687
As a human being he has shown
human ideals in his activities

40:50.687 --> 41:00.917
The person who loved his wife so much
knew she was pure and hed left her

41:00.917 --> 41:12.712
Now people give so much to their own wife
but they never give to poor people

41:12.737 --> 41:18.602
Otherwise they give to their relatives
It's a disease among politicians

41:18.602 --> 41:28.372
But the one who has wife who is sakshat
devi had to leave her

41:28.397 --> 41:36.937
We must understand it's attachment
to relatives and possessions

41:36.937 --> 41:44.257
In west marriage relation wasn't alright
but after Sahaja Yoga wife became everything

41:44.282 --> 41:52.145
Here leaders had to leave
because their wives were not alright

41:52.287 --> 41:56.727
Their attention got spoiled
by wife's preaching

41:56.737 --> 42:00.976
At least five yogi left
because of their wives

42:01.442 --> 42:12.467
Wives should understand Sahaja Yoga
and their role in it

42:12.467 --> 42:18.207
In this case husbands shouldn't
agree with their wives at all

42:18.207 --> 42:24.167
Tell her that “You talk and move
too much, Be quiet"

42:24.167 --> 42:27.587
You are useless
Your chakras are not alright

42:27.597 --> 42:32.712
She will be alright only in this way

42:32.712 --> 42:39.017
But instead you blame yourself
and obey your wife?

42:39.042 --> 42:42.112
If she tells you to steal, you do it?

42:42.137 --> 42:50.627
Even after Sahaja Yoga you still
have some catches to take care

42:50.627 --> 43:01.627
On the occasion of Shri Rama
Hanuman should be remembered as his great devotee

43:01.627 --> 43:06.107
And how he was busy at his service

43:06.107 --> 43:18.102
He was aware that his life is
for serving Shri Rama

43:18.102 --> 43:25.282
We should have his awereness in Sahaj Yoga

43:25.307 --> 43:32.047
But it doesn't mean you cook food for
me which I don't eat

43:32.047 --> 43:38.382
You trouble me cooking so much
this and that

43:38.382 --> 43:44.382
Don't keep on serving someone forcefully

43:44.407 --> 43:50.567
What we need is zeal to serve (Sewa)

43:50.577 --> 43:54.062
Hanuman didn't serve food to Shri Rama

43:54.062 --> 43:57.465
Delhi people kept on
serving food so much

43:57.490 --> 44:03.317
that I had to tell them
I wouln't come if you don't stop

44:03.484 --> 44:07.267
Do what you have to do

44:07.267 --> 44:11.529
It's bad to force someone to eat

44:11.529 --> 44:15.152
serving one after another

44:15.177 --> 44:19.217
I don't need anything
and I am tired

44:19.227 --> 44:26.996
I told you only flowers
But don't spend too much also

44:27.082 --> 44:34.682
A lot of flowers make me
worry sometimes

44:34.707 --> 44:42.984
Please your Mother in balance
She is a simple woman who don't understand these

44:43.442 --> 44:51.012
We have to learn that zeal to serve is
from Hanuman ji

44:51.037 --> 44:55.977
There is no special service for me

44:56.002 --> 45:03.092
But if you want to serve me
serve to Sahaj Yoga

45:04.797 --> 45:08.297
Serving to Sahaja Yoga is
serving to me

45:08.297 --> 45:12.877
How many realisation have you given

45:12.902 --> 45:16.401
How many did you transform and inspire

45:16.520 --> 45:22.857
But if you say to new people
they have bhoot, they just leave

45:22.882 --> 45:33.717
One gentleman was told he has
3 bhoots in him so he left Sahaja Yoga

45:33.717 --> 45:38.517
he was told number of bhoots even

45:38.542 --> 45:45.301
he believed it because the Yogi
was an authority in the local area

45:45.458 --> 45:49.817
I don't know who
but the person left

45:49.817 --> 45:56.257
So what we have to learn
from Hanuman is the zeal

45:56.257 --> 46:00.137
" Ram kaj karne ko tatpar"
(eager to do Ram's work)

46:00.137 --> 46:04.677
What is our work?
My work is sahaj yoga

46:04.677 --> 46:09.027
My work is sahaj yoga
To raise kundalini

46:09.037 --> 46:13.770
To make people peaceful and lovable
talking about love

46:13.795 --> 46:27.227
Talk about Sahaja Yoga, about chakras
Make them understand

46:27.237 --> 46:34.437
Doesn't mean you start giving lecture
Some people started to give so much lecture

46:34.437 --> 46:40.097
I had to tell them to stop
Otherwise Sahaja Yoga will be finished

46:40.107 --> 46:47.987
Only long lectures
No time for Mother's talk and Aarti

46:47.997 --> 46:52.902
He said he just can't stop

46:52.902 --> 46:57.232
He doesn't know why
"How can I fix it?"

46:57.232 --> 47:00.722
"You put supari (spice) in your mouth"

47:00.747 --> 47:05.717
Then "How much?"

47:05.717 --> 47:09.577
"It depends on the size of your mouth"

47:09.602 --> 47:15.407
"You don't know it even then
how come you talk aobut Sahaja Yoga"

47:15.407 --> 47:18.907
you don't know it even

47:18.907 --> 47:21.457
People like giving lecture

47:21.467 --> 47:28.077
Get on a stage and won't leave a mic

47:28.077 --> 47:34.057
Once with mic they cant't leave
It's a new disease

47:34.057 --> 47:40.807
So you must understand
why to give lecture

47:40.832 --> 47:49.757
There are so many Mother's talk
you can put a tape or video in every program

47:49.757 --> 48:02.627
After people can write question on paper
And ask them to bring it next program

48:02.627 --> 48:06.927
If there are someone
who is sick or in trouble

48:06.937 --> 48:13.737
Now there is a Yogi
He comes to cure in Calcutta

48:13.737 --> 48:21.187
Now he was called to Russia

48:21.197 --> 48:25.529
One person is running like
Hanuman all over to cure

48:25.554 --> 48:30.914
You all can cure
All women can do

48:30.939 --> 48:34.321
All men also
But nobody tries

48:34.575 --> 48:38.877
By giving lecture how many were cured?

48:39.003 --> 48:40.512
I don't know why only one in India

48:40.512 --> 48:41.012
don't know what's the matter
that till now there is only one man in India
who can cure people

48:44.667 --> 48:52.117
In London there are 15~20 people
who can cure and in France also

48:52.117 --> 48:58.459
One should learn working on people
like giving bandhan

48:58.515 --> 49:09.257
No need to invite someone from abroad
Remove Sahaja Yoga badges if you cannot cure

49:09.257 --> 49:14.232
How do you work on others
if you can't cure even yourself

49:14.257 --> 49:20.272
Everybody has got
all the power to cure anyone

49:20.272 --> 49:24.157
Learn to become masters

49:24.157 --> 49:29.127
Instead of inviting someone
They should go out to cure

49:29.167 --> 49:34.650
Just have some courage to work
Nothing will happen

49:34.849 --> 49:44.469
By working, you become deeper like
a tree grows deeper as it expands

49:44.935 --> 49:52.882
Sahaja Yogis are very much different
from Incarnations

49:52.907 --> 49:57.967
They have never worked in society before

49:57.967 --> 50:02.397
Nobody had the power for a mass

50:02.422 --> 50:08.282
Only one to one
Like King Janaka to Nachiketa

50:08.297 --> 50:17.542
But now you all have it
Just grow it, that's all

50:17.542 --> 50:24.427
Cure yourself and others
Understand Sahaja Yoga, you have everything

50:24.482 --> 50:30.147
But still your attention is wondering
What are you running after?

50:30.147 --> 50:36.795
You still don't understand it
Sahaja Yoga is just blessing

50:36.875 --> 50:41.147
You won't be in short of anything

50:41.172 --> 50:46.547
Just work for sahaja Yoga
Even if you don't work you will be blessed

50:46.547 --> 50:52.677
Business or promotion,
this and that

50:52.702 --> 50:59.520
Everyone is blessed and
nothing to give up

50:59.545 --> 51:05.200
Otherwise in time of freedom fight

51:05.387 --> 51:11.443
we were tortured
Lied on ice, got electric shocks

51:11.482 --> 51:15.972
My parents went to jail
Our house was sold

51:15.972 --> 51:23.737
Lived in a hut... had to sacrifice a lot
And you don't have to do it

51:23.737 --> 51:28.707
But not only recieving
You have to give

51:28.713 --> 51:36.045
If one door is open so should be the other one
Only one doesn't work

51:36.064 --> 51:42.773
Everyone reports me
about blessings they got

51:44.012 --> 51:50.967
We must see what we have done for others

51:51.017 --> 52:03.477
But there are many fights for leadership
It's all mother's play

52:03.487 --> 52:07.627
You will know it when you will fall from there

52:07.627 --> 52:14.356
Specially women shouldn't get involved
They fall very soon

52:14.381 --> 52:19.347
And men should know
there is nothing like ministers

52:19.426 --> 52:22.982
This is Mother's play
Don't get involved in

52:22.982 --> 52:30.994
Why I call a leader? It's a play
There are no leaders

52:31.081 --> 52:39.737
It's just a test if you have ego
If you have, you are gone

52:39.737 --> 52:46.507
It will be shown immediately
In Sahaja Yoga everything gets exposed

52:46.539 --> 52:51.410
Even if I say something
it shows on the faces

52:51.426 --> 52:59.149
Once some leaders came and
confessed their mistakes

52:59.205 --> 53:08.817
They have more responsibilities to be
better, sweet, humble and loving

53:08.817 --> 53:13.207
and become close and sharing with everyone

53:13.207 --> 53:22.277
Now on the auspicious occasion of Shri Rama
we must understand what he had showen

53:22.302 --> 53:28.229
Only a bit of it would please our Mother

53:28.267 --> 53:39.402
He was in exile for a long time in Jungle
Walked barefeet, worked so hard

53:39.402 --> 53:43.352
Just to obey his father

53:43.352 --> 53:47.362
Now to obey me
you don't need to go into exile

53:47.362 --> 53:52.647
Not barefeet, nor starving nothing
All are there for you

53:52.763 --> 53:59.247
But you must know how to cure people
in Sahaja Yoga

53:59.247 --> 54:02.727
everything about sahaj yoga

54:02.754 --> 54:07.412
and mostly about love

54:07.437 --> 54:15.197
it's nothing but power of love
Everybody will be benefited

54:15.197 --> 54:21.727
This is not only for special people

54:21.737 --> 54:28.940
This is not only for one country
but for the whole world

54:29.402 --> 54:38.247
Watch how your attention is
If it's disturbed we should correct it

54:38.324 --> 54:45.437
Put the power of spirit in it
Do everything with concentration

54:45.541 --> 54:52.080
And devotion and love will
make you deep

54:52.080 --> 54:58.970
Otherwise there is lots of rubbish

54:58.995 --> 55:06.896
If you wish to stay like rubbish
you know where it goes at the end

55:06.983 --> 55:11.727
If you want to feel you are
specially good capable of anything

55:11.942 --> 55:17.926
First humility, not only towards me
but everyone

55:18.093 --> 55:30.805
Talk humbly with love and show that
people can blossom like lotus in Sahaja Yoga

55:30.908 --> 55:33.402
to spread fragrance everywhere

55:33.402 --> 55:42.007
People will tell me you are wonderful
if you will do it in that way

55:42.007 --> 55:47.128
One day you too will be called as
Maryada Purushottama

55:47.208 --> 55:53.189
You are the temple of Rama
so have it within yourself

55:53.237 --> 55:59.276
Perform puja to it
Take care of your self-esteem

55:59.808 --> 56:08.765
Take the benefit of self-realization
inside yourself

56:08.812 --> 56:13.397
You must have respect and devotion to it

56:13.397 --> 56:21.695
"Now we are realized"
"How can we do wrong, we are yogi"

56:21.767 --> 56:28.387
Soon you will have blessings
immediately

56:28.387 --> 56:34.525
As I am called Rokra devi, you will get
blessing as soon as you assert it

56:34.771 --> 56:44.177
Everyone is getting blessed with it
give it back to the world

56:44.202 --> 56:57.912
Shri Rama used all his powers for the
benevolence of people to show the ideal

56:57.912 --> 57:05.812
You will be surprised to achieve so high
when the time comes

57:05.822 --> 57:13.832
You won't have any disease and
all bad habits will be dropped

57:13.857 --> 57:22.042
You will eat, talk and watch
as much as you need

57:22.090 --> 57:34.419
You will watch your mind
for introspection

57:34.451 --> 57:45.205
"Where is my mind going?"
"I'm a Sahaja Yogi, stop it"

57:46.125 --> 57:50.003
By doing so
you will be in meditation

57:50.028 --> 57:56.360
Your kundalini will be satisfied
and give you blessings

57:56.385 --> 57:59.365
You say,
"Mother what a blessing"

57:59.537 --> 58:04.240
But you have to jump into it
Only then will you know it

58:04.375 --> 58:08.712
Till then you need to work hard

58:08.712 --> 58:14.792
Shri Rama was born
at midnight so let's have puja late

58:14.817 --> 58:21.879
Shri Rama Puja is not
a specially long one

58:22.060 --> 58:33.791
As he is in a human form
he is humanity within us

58:34.043 --> 58:46.552
by which we understand our intellect
and our thoughts get changed

58:46.577 --> 58:53.847
Shri Rama is that
Through him we can change our thoughts

58:53.847 --> 59:00.017
Our nature can change
Because he is our ideal

59:00.017 --> 59:07.438
After achieving his ideals we reach another
because he was human ideal

59:07.487 --> 59:13.667
It is great that God came to this world
in a human form to became our ideal

59:13.698 --> 59:23.472
He has gone through all the hardships
to show us strength to keep Dharma

59:23.497 --> 59:28.180
That is Vishwa Dharma
and the state of yoga

59:28.791 --> 59:32.807
May God bless you all
