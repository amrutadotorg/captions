00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:38.298
We have gathered here on the occassion of Ram Navami

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:40.198
and everybody has said

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:44.307
that, "Mother please tell us about Shri Rama".

00:04:46.378 --> 00:04:50.832
As you know that Shri Rama has taken

00:04:51.033 --> 00:04:54.451
a very important place in our chakras.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.792
He is seated on our right heart.

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:05.183
Shri Rama

00:05:07.184 --> 00:05:11.660
represents the place of the father (right heart),

00:05:11.861 --> 00:05:17.886
so lack of father's responsibility

00:05:18.087 --> 00:05:20.813
or father's love

00:05:21.815 --> 00:05:26.481
can cause a catch of this chakra.

00:05:28.906 --> 00:05:33.955
In Sahaja Yoga we can understand that Rama

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:40.216
and all other Gods

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.849
came on earth as different manifestations of divine energy (shakti);

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.872
they came to do their jobs.

00:05:50.073 --> 00:05:54.384
In that sense Shri Rama has a special job.

00:05:56.537 --> 00:06:02.171
Like Socrates has said benevolent king has to come.

00:06:02.372 --> 00:06:06.654
As a reflection of that Shri Rama came.

00:06:08.158 --> 00:06:12.792
Shri Rama came in complete human form

00:06:12.993 --> 00:06:17.867
He even forgot that he is a incarnation of Shri Vishnu.

00:06:18.068 --> 00:06:20.832
He was made to forget this.

00:06:21.034 --> 00:06:25.019
However for the world

00:06:25.242 --> 00:06:30.130
He was Purushottam (Ideal human being).

00:06:31.078 --> 00:06:38.309
You all must have heard of his qualities and his childhood

00:06:39.826 --> 00:06:46.093
In Sahaja yoga we should understand

00:06:46.282 --> 00:06:51.417
that when we worship any of the Gods,

00:06:51.694 --> 00:06:56.058
when we consider them as our ideal,

00:06:56.249 --> 00:07:01.248
then which qualities we can gain from them,

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:05.782
which qualities we have received?

00:07:05.983 --> 00:07:08.360
Shri Rama has many noble qualities.

00:07:08.562 --> 00:07:11.285
One quality was that He was Purushotam (ideal),

00:07:11.485 --> 00:07:19.225
another was how He ruled as a king.

00:07:19.542 --> 00:07:24.472
He kept his people's opinions higher than Himself,

00:07:24.673 --> 00:07:29.494
higher than his wife and children.

00:07:29.695 --> 00:07:33.914
In the present time,

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:42.145
if people and politicians understand this point,

00:07:42.346 --> 00:07:46.374
they wouldn't be called as selfish,

00:07:46.575 --> 00:07:48.572
they wouldn't be selfish,

00:07:48.773 --> 00:07:51.092
they would be followers of Dharma.

00:07:51.293 --> 00:07:59.651
However, none has tried to adopt Shri Rama as a role model till now.

00:08:00.325 --> 00:08:03.165
On the other hand, they will sing His bhajans

00:08:03.366 --> 00:08:10.744
or in his name build large organisations and temples.

00:08:10.945 --> 00:08:15.822
By doing all this, has Shri Rama come in the hearts of these people?

00:08:16.023 --> 00:08:19.562
Can you get His light in your life?

00:08:19.763 --> 00:08:21.711
Only Sahaja Yogis can do this

00:08:21.912 --> 00:08:29.500
that is to bring the light of Shri Rama into their attention.

00:08:30.822 --> 00:08:33.748
He is totally without any attachments.

00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:38.505
As it is, all the deities are free from sins and punyas(good deeds),

00:08:38.706 --> 00:08:42.056
Whatever we deem as a sin

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:44.723
if they do, is not a sin.

00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:48.013
For example, Shri Krishna killed many people,

00:08:48.214 --> 00:08:50.836
Shri Rama killed Ravana.

00:08:51.038 --> 00:08:57.311
It can be considered a sin in worldly sense

00:08:57.512 --> 00:09:00.836
but not in the eyes of God.

00:09:01.037 --> 00:09:05.879
Because they destroy evil people and remove evils

00:09:06.081 --> 00:09:12.753
and they have the right to do whatever is needed for this purpose.

00:09:12.954 --> 00:09:17.875
Like when Shri Devi slayed rakshasas, She killed the demons.

00:09:18.077 --> 00:09:20.780
Some people may ask if She has committed a sin.

00:09:20.981 --> 00:09:25.730
However Her responsibility is to destroy the rakshasas

00:09:25.931 --> 00:09:30.588
and protect the saints.

00:09:33.207 --> 00:09:39.209
In Shri Rama's life Ahilya's redemption is the most important event.

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:41.796
He reedemed Ahilya.

00:09:41.997 --> 00:09:46.194
She was cursed by her husband.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:51.451
In those times if any women goes out of dharma,

00:09:51.652 --> 00:09:55.778
and if her husband was a saint of high stature,

00:09:55.979 --> 00:09:58.375
he could curse her.

00:09:59.086 --> 00:10:03.489
But Ahillya was blamed falsely.

00:10:03.719 --> 00:10:06.264
and false allegations were made.

00:10:06.465 --> 00:10:09.226
And she was made into stone.

00:10:09.428 --> 00:10:13.767
So Shri Rama saved Ahilya.

00:10:14.338 --> 00:10:21.436
Particularly His attitude towards His wife,

00:10:22.484 --> 00:10:25.185
His love for Her,

00:10:25.386 --> 00:10:30.832
His commitment to having only one wife

00:10:31.046 --> 00:10:34.158
is something to be really understood.

00:10:34.359 --> 00:10:38.470
Even though He knew that Sitaji was the incarnation of Shri Mahalaxmi

00:10:38.669 --> 00:10:40.603
She Herself was a Devi.

00:10:40.804 --> 00:10:43.472
But in His human form

00:10:43.671 --> 00:10:49.663
He never raised His eyes to look at any other women but his wife.

00:10:50.317 --> 00:10:52.386
When we talk about Shri Rama

00:10:52.536 --> 00:10:58.448
the husband like qualities inside us should be pure.

00:10:58.774 --> 00:11:03.302
When any lady thinks about Shri Rama

00:11:03.503 --> 00:11:07.433
she should have the same faith in her husband

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.415
like Shri Sita had in Her husband.

00:11:10.616 --> 00:11:14.233
Similarly, husbands also need to adopt the quality of Shri Rama

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.818
of being devoted to their one wife.

00:11:17.019 --> 00:11:19.497
This is not difficult for Sahaja Yogis.

00:11:19.698 --> 00:11:24.450
Women should be respected. Have respect for your wife!

00:11:24.651 --> 00:11:28.380
Although Ravana kidnapped Sitaji

00:11:28.581 --> 00:11:34.041
Shri Rama felt it is His duty to rescue Her.

00:11:34.242 --> 00:11:38.093
But in His kingdom it was His duty to follow the will of the people

00:11:38.284 --> 00:11:40.085
and He had so much balance

00:11:40.286 --> 00:11:44.916
that Shri Sita only for whom He woeked hard to rescue

00:11:45.117 --> 00:11:48.139
He left Her because of the will of the people.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.652
As Sitaji Herself was the Goddess,

00:11:50.859 --> 00:11:54.210
this had no particular impact on Her,

00:11:54.411 --> 00:11:56.289
it had no consequence.

00:11:56.471 --> 00:11:58.261
So Shri Rama sacrificied Her.

00:11:58.462 --> 00:12:04.771
People talk about such things which are not in public interest.

00:12:04.972 --> 00:12:08.930
Being their ideal, He did not want them to think that He condoned

00:12:09.131 --> 00:12:15.375
keeping the company of women whose character is under doubt.

00:12:15.984 --> 00:12:18.294
Although She was the unblemishable Devi (Nishkalanka),

00:12:18.495 --> 00:12:21.220
She was the embodiment of the purity of the Devi,

00:12:21.421 --> 00:12:26.012
when He left Her, in one way She left Him too.

00:12:26.213 --> 00:12:29.662
She left Him in a manner a woman would do

00:12:29.845 --> 00:12:32.357
and Shri Rama as a man would do.

00:12:32.558 --> 00:12:35.041
Sitaji disappeared into the Mother Earth

00:12:35.216 --> 00:12:40.609
and then in the end Shri Rama went into River Sarayu.

00:12:41.172 --> 00:12:47.760
Their life was very eventful and full of miracles.

00:12:48.082 --> 00:12:51.098
In their whole life you can see how Shri Sita and Shri Rama

00:12:51.289 --> 00:12:57.178
had respect and were faithful to each other.

00:12:57.379 --> 00:13:00.125
Even though Shri Rama left Shri Sita,

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.337
She understood that it was His royal duty,

00:13:03.538 --> 00:13:07.563
and She never complained or talked ill of Him.

00:13:07.765 --> 00:13:12.702
And effortlessly She raised Her children,

00:13:12.904 --> 00:13:16.110
and made them flourish and develop.

00:13:16.827 --> 00:13:22.074
Shri Rama's two children are called Luv and Kush.

00:13:22.275 --> 00:13:25.920
They came like devotees

00:13:26.111 --> 00:13:31.226
and in this world we can see them as the ideal disciples.

00:13:31.427 --> 00:13:33.023
They represent the disciple principle

00:13:33.224 --> 00:13:38.845
and for us they are the power of disciplehood

00:13:39.187 --> 00:13:42.124
with which we can become disciple of someone.

00:13:42.325 --> 00:13:48.242
As disciples they learned archery at a very young age.

00:13:48.443 --> 00:13:51.840
In their young age they learned Ramayana

00:13:52.015 --> 00:13:56.021
and got proficiency in music.

00:13:56.222 --> 00:14:03.557
It means that the disciples must surrender completely to their guru.

00:14:03.758 --> 00:14:08.183
We also have the qualities of a disciple innately within us.

00:14:08.384 --> 00:14:15.906
They were completely surrendered to their Mother, who was Shakti.

00:14:16.107 --> 00:14:21.552
Even they were about to fight against Shri Rama for their Mother,

00:14:21.753 --> 00:14:25.163
so they kept their Mother as the highest in the world.

00:14:25.371 --> 00:14:28.104
The Mother also cared for them,

00:14:28.305 --> 00:14:31.457
nurtured them and made them stand on dharma.

00:14:31.658 --> 00:14:34.712
To make them progress was Her foremost priority and duty.

00:14:34.913 --> 00:14:37.302
Not like today's wives who would have cried:

00:14:37.503 --> 00:14:39.762
"My husband left me, my husband has left me".

00:14:39.963 --> 00:14:43.021
But when they get a husband they will fight all the time

00:14:43.222 --> 00:14:45.859
and when the husband leaves them then they will cry.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.443
Unlike Sitaji who felt: "If He has left Me, no problem.

00:14:48.644 --> 00:14:51.454
These are My children, I will take care of them.

00:14:51.637 --> 00:14:59.498
And nothing should happen that deprive them of anything".

00:14:59.699 --> 00:15:05.759
Shri Sita's bravery and fortitude

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:09.291
were the special qualities seen in Her life.

00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:12.186
Every lady must imbibe these qualities.

00:15:12.387 --> 00:15:14.969
Even if you are separated from your husband

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:17.271
and you are not longer together,

00:15:17.472 --> 00:15:20.850
even then, because of your husband,

00:15:21.037 --> 00:15:25.174
you should not let that create a loss for you or your children.

00:15:25.375 --> 00:15:30.795
Because your duty is the most important thing.

00:15:30.992 --> 00:15:33.718
You should not give up this most important thing.

00:15:33.919 --> 00:15:40.897
All Sahaja Yoginis should try to get this power of Shakti.

00:15:41.799 --> 00:15:45.530
Shri Rama's life was also very pure and spotless (nirmal)

00:15:45.731 --> 00:15:49.881
and He gave up everything for His wife.

00:15:49.952 --> 00:15:55.516
When his wife was exiled to the forest,

00:15:55.723 --> 00:15:57.731
and He had to live alone,

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:01.474
and when He sacrificed Her,

00:16:01.675 --> 00:16:05.745
He gave up all the comforts of the royal life.

00:16:05.946 --> 00:16:10.568
You know He used to sleep on the grass, on the floor

00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:16.598
walked barefeet and wore clothes like an ascetic.

00:16:17.402 --> 00:16:20.292
All these are not stories This is the truth,

00:16:20.493 --> 00:16:24.647
In our world, in India, many people were born

00:16:24.822 --> 00:16:28.472
whose life had a high standard of morals

00:16:28.673 --> 00:16:32.216
and they never thought about small or low level things.

00:16:32.417 --> 00:16:35.644
But all these ideal people of our country

00:16:35.845 --> 00:16:41.212
have become superfluous over time.

00:16:41.576 --> 00:16:45.106
We think that Shri Rama is ours, we are His devotees

00:16:45.307 --> 00:16:48.006
and we can attain Him by only singing bhajans to Him.

00:16:48.328 --> 00:16:51.422
We have developed a kind of hypocrisy.

00:16:51.751 --> 00:16:55.169
In other countries where they do not have such models (like Shri Rama)

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:58.674
the people there try to correct themselves.

00:16:58.875 --> 00:17:00.584
They try to make themselves ok.

00:17:00.785 --> 00:17:02.999
Because you have a model like Shri Ram

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.292
you say you can never become like Him,

00:17:05.493 --> 00:17:07.950
or like Shri Krishna.

00:17:08.151 --> 00:17:09.716
We feel they became models,

00:17:09.915 --> 00:17:12.031
but we are not able to relate with Them.

00:17:12.232 --> 00:17:14.361
We get feelings like that.

00:17:14.562 --> 00:17:17.266
But if we have Shri Rama inside,

00:17:17.467 --> 00:17:20.959
His light can certainly come in our attention.

00:17:21.628 --> 00:17:24.458
Why cannot it come? Why should we not attain this?

00:17:24.659 --> 00:17:28.057
Why should we not try to learn about the circumstances

00:17:28.264 --> 00:17:30.892
around which Shri Rama came on this earth?

00:17:31.093 --> 00:17:33.641
A Sahaja Yogi must consider this -

00:17:33.842 --> 00:17:36.139
if we can attain Shri Rama's spiritual state,

00:17:36.357 --> 00:17:39.308
then all our political problems will be resolved,

00:17:39.491 --> 00:17:43.474
all our problems will be over.

00:17:43.675 --> 00:17:46.468
This will happen the day Sahay Yogis resolve in their heart

00:17:46.636 --> 00:17:48.736
that they would like to become like Shri Rama.

00:17:48.937 --> 00:17:52.427
In our country, where Shri Ram ruled,

00:17:52.658 --> 00:17:56.933
He conducted His rule in a selfless state

00:17:58.648 --> 00:18:03.648
and in a state of enlightment.

00:18:04.216 --> 00:18:07.668
And He desired all good qualities should come in His people.

00:18:07.869 --> 00:18:10.276
And He wanted that firstly His people to become dharmic,

00:18:10.477 --> 00:18:13.710
get educated and evolved.

00:18:13.911 --> 00:18:19.081
He wanted many high ideals should be established in them.

00:18:19.282 --> 00:18:22.875
This He tried to do all the time.

00:18:23.058 --> 00:18:26.335
And for this He made His life very idealistic (for others to follow).

00:18:26.536 --> 00:18:30.863
Just think, if someone tells you something

00:18:31.064 --> 00:18:33.148
but he himself does not follow his own advise

00:18:33.349 --> 00:18:36.111
then how can you have faith in such a person?

00:18:36.318 --> 00:18:38.299
Therefore you cannot get the qualities.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:42.232
However, many people say, "We follow this person or that person".

00:18:42.433 --> 00:18:45.202
But in reality, they are just the opposite of whom they follow.

00:18:45.403 --> 00:18:49.205
Followers of Ram seems to be the most corrupt politicians possible?

00:18:49.406 --> 00:18:51.080
or they have more than ten wives.

00:18:51.279 --> 00:18:54.341
How can they say they follow Shri Rama?

00:18:54.617 --> 00:19:00.368
What is the duty of a Sahaja Yogi in his life?

00:19:00.569 --> 00:19:05.641
We also have to bring the light of the Gods in our attention.

00:19:05.842 --> 00:19:11.621
For every situation we must think: "What would Shri Rama have done?"

00:19:11.822 --> 00:19:15.829
If such a question arose then what woud Shri Rama have replied.

00:19:16.009 --> 00:19:19.649
If such a question arose then what woud Shri Sita have replied.

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:21.921
What would Sita ji say?

00:19:22.096 --> 00:19:24.141
How would Shri Sita behave?

00:19:24.342 --> 00:19:26.045
If any lady thinks like that

00:19:26.246 --> 00:19:29.281
she would certainly become the Gruhlaxmi of her house.

00:19:29.482 --> 00:19:34.279
As you Sahaja Yogis know, Sitaji took many births after that.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:40.702
And She came as incarnation of Gruhlaxmi as Fatima-bi.

00:19:40.903 --> 00:19:43.529
She used to stay at home under a veil,

00:19:43.712 --> 00:19:47.776
but all dharma was done by Her power.

00:19:47.977 --> 00:19:51.850
Not necessary for you to go out and give big lectures

00:19:52.041 --> 00:19:54.287
or become a leader. There is no need.

00:19:54.488 --> 00:19:58.107
You can do this work from home,

00:19:58.308 --> 00:20:06.243
you can spread Sahaja Yoga to your children, relatives and friends.

00:20:06.444 --> 00:20:08.978
But at first you should attain this (Sahaja Yoga).

00:20:09.179 --> 00:20:13.150
After all this work is done, you can spread it to society.

00:20:13.351 --> 00:20:16.678
After that you can go elsewhere to spread it, if you want.

00:20:16.879 --> 00:20:23.591
But first ladies should have pure character like Sitaji.

00:20:23.792 --> 00:20:27.851
First reflection of this purity is a strong maternal feeling of love.

00:20:28.052 --> 00:20:31.071
When She was exiled in the jungle along with Her husband

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:35.133
She never complained that, "My husband doesn't earn, He doesn't earn.

00:20:35.334 --> 00:20:37.130
Just like the women here complain,

00:20:37.331 --> 00:20:39.825
"He doesn't do this, he doesn't buy this or that".

00:20:40.026 --> 00:20:42.331
If he is in jungle, then so am I.

00:20:42.532 --> 00:20:44.878
Whatever he will eat, I will also eat.

00:20:45.079 --> 00:20:47.285
Will I eat before he eats?

00:20:47.468 --> 00:20:49.061
Shri Sita would not have done that.

00:20:49.262 --> 00:20:52.968
Let me serve him first and then the brother in law, let them finish

00:20:53.159 --> 00:20:54.338
then I will eat.

00:20:54.539 --> 00:20:58.891
Nowadays women think there is too much...

00:21:00.947 --> 00:21:06.962
there is too much pressure of the work on them.

00:21:07.163 --> 00:21:08.591
But it is not so.

00:21:08.792 --> 00:21:11.685
A woman is like earth element.

00:21:12.042 --> 00:21:15.407
She has so much power that she can absorb a lot of pressure.

00:21:15.607 --> 00:21:20.340
So much is being given by the earth: flowers, fruit, leaves etc.

00:21:20.541 --> 00:21:24.354
In the same manner, women are like the earth element.

00:21:24.555 --> 00:21:30.144
We have got so many powers that we can absorb everything inside.

00:21:30.345 --> 00:21:33.984
and shower the rain of love which is inside us.

00:21:34.185 --> 00:21:36.406
God has given us this power.

00:21:36.607 --> 00:21:38.737
So if you have this power -

00:21:38.938 --> 00:21:42.690
for example if this fan is moving, it is due to the electricity.

00:21:42.891 --> 00:21:46.722
Then which one is greater, the electricity or the fan?

00:21:48.063 --> 00:21:52.662
If you think the fan is greater because it is moving

00:21:52.845 --> 00:21:54.771
then you are under an illusion.

00:21:54.972 --> 00:21:59.027
The manifestation of feminine energy is huge, like an ocean.

00:21:59.228 --> 00:22:03.992
With that support men do their work.

00:22:04.193 --> 00:22:07.281
This is like potential and kinetic states of energy.

00:22:07.482 --> 00:22:11.350
So women are the potential energy and men are the kinetic energy.

00:22:11.551 --> 00:22:14.915
But wanting to emulate men, because they can run faster.

00:22:15.075 --> 00:22:16.647
women also start running.

00:22:16.848 --> 00:22:19.954
There is no need for a woman to do that. She needs to sit.

00:22:20.155 --> 00:22:23.750
Roles of both are different

00:22:23.951 --> 00:22:26.731
so each of them need to play their role in solving a problem.

00:22:26.932 --> 00:22:29.971
Actually, women can thrive in both activities (potential and kinetic).

00:22:30.172 --> 00:22:34.137
When the time comes women can be more productive than men.

00:22:34.338 --> 00:22:37.607
As you may be aware, in Maharashtra there was a widow named Tarabai

00:22:37.808 --> 00:22:40.672
who was 17 years, 17 years only.

00:22:40.873 --> 00:22:45.090
She was the younger daughter-in-law of Shivaji

00:22:45.291 --> 00:22:49.545
All lost against Aurangzeb and she defeated him at only 17 years.

00:22:49.746 --> 00:22:52.617
and built his grave in a place called Aurangabad.

00:22:52.818 --> 00:22:54.277
You can understand today

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:59.556
that if a woman is able to concentrate all her powers.

00:22:59.757 --> 00:23:04.020
Like it is said that when her powers are in a manifested state,

00:23:04.221 --> 00:23:06.430
then she can become fierce (prachand).

00:23:06.631 --> 00:23:13.169
But if she wastes or fritters away her powers

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:18.732
by wasting it in fighting, arguing, complaining or in frivolous things,

00:23:18.933 --> 00:23:21.782
then her power is completely destroyed.

00:23:21.983 --> 00:23:25.212
Women are so powerful

00:23:25.411 --> 00:23:30.150
that if they want, they can work more than men.

00:23:30.351 --> 00:23:33.634
However, first of all, they must respect their powers.

00:23:33.835 --> 00:23:37.745
By throwing her powers here and there, by destroying her powers,

00:23:37.936 --> 00:23:39.838
she becomes powerless.

00:23:40.039 --> 00:23:42.634
These powerless women are of no use to anyone.

00:23:42.835 --> 00:23:45.271
Therefore, the woman's role

00:23:45.469 --> 00:23:47.884
is of utmost importance and full of dignity.

00:23:48.085 --> 00:23:54.589
Women should therefore be very modest and very wise.

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:59.237
For example, sometimes men use swear words but real women do not.

00:23:59.821 --> 00:24:03.207
You might have seen that men argue and can even have physical fights.

00:24:03.406 --> 00:24:06.081
Let them! But women do not do that.

00:24:06.282 --> 00:24:08.431
Their job is to emit peace,

00:24:08.638 --> 00:24:10.987
their job is to give protection

00:24:11.201 --> 00:24:14.211
and their job is to save everyone.

00:24:14.412 --> 00:24:16.796
For example, there is a shield.

00:24:17.003 --> 00:24:19.142
A shield cannot function as a sword

00:24:19.343 --> 00:24:21.545
and a sword cannot function as a shield.

00:24:21.746 --> 00:24:24.906
So is the shield more important or the sword?

00:24:25.089 --> 00:24:28.593
Obviously the shield, as it can withstand the attack of the sword.

00:24:28.794 --> 00:24:31.652
Sometimes the sword may even break but not the shield.

00:24:31.853 --> 00:24:35.410
So women must be engulfed in their power.

00:24:35.585 --> 00:24:38.659
And the main lever for manifesting this strength

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:41.411
is the power of humility.

00:24:41.807 --> 00:24:45.662
With humility we should establish these powers within us.

00:24:45.863 --> 00:24:48.269
This work is not difficult for Sahaja Yogis.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:50.642
For Sahaja Yogis this is not difficult at all.

00:24:50.843 --> 00:24:54.637
I see many Sahaja Yoginis talking so much nonsense.

00:24:54.838 --> 00:24:58.329
I don't know why, but anywhere they want to chat non-stop with men.

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:00.622
Once a gentleman came running to Me and said, "Mother save me, save me!"

00:25:00.823 --> 00:25:02.330
I asked ”What happened?”, He said "She is after me".

00:25:02.536 --> 00:25:04.382
I asked, ”Who?”, "The one who talks a lot."

00:25:04.583 --> 00:25:06.104
I said, ”The one who talks a lot?”.

00:25:06.305 --> 00:25:08.165
He said, "Yes, save me, I am fed up with her".

00:25:08.366 --> 00:25:10.090
So he came to hide in My room.

00:25:10.291 --> 00:25:13.391
There is no need to excessively talk with men.

00:25:13.592 --> 00:25:15.676
What is the need to talk nonsense?

00:25:15.877 --> 00:25:18.997
Amongst women also, no need to talk about unimportant things.

00:25:19.198 --> 00:25:22.965
In Sahaja Yoga, I have seen that men make more effort to study.

00:25:23.181 --> 00:25:24.565
Women should also do that,

00:25:24.766 --> 00:25:26.917
what is Sahaja Yoga and what chakras there are,

00:25:27.102 --> 00:25:29.491
which chakra have what impact,

00:25:29.697 --> 00:25:33.160
which chakra causes which problem.

00:25:33.361 --> 00:25:35.094
They should have full knowledge of this.

00:25:35.295 --> 00:25:38.285
If only men learn this knowledge, then women will be left behind.

00:25:38.486 --> 00:25:40.742
Women must learn all this.

00:25:40.943 --> 00:25:46.221
Now for men, Shri Rama is their role model.

00:25:47.348 --> 00:25:52.840
I feel in a way, Muslims have played a good role for us.

00:25:53.041 --> 00:25:56.373
I do not criticize them. This problem is not in their country.

00:25:56.574 --> 00:25:58.324
Say if you go to Riyad,

00:25:58.491 --> 00:26:01.347
no Muslim will stare at you.

00:26:01.578 --> 00:26:03.178
I have not seem anyone doing that.

00:26:03.379 --> 00:26:05.404
If there is a lady, they will give her respect.

00:26:05.571 --> 00:26:07.511
If any lady is crossing the street,

00:26:07.718 --> 00:26:09.596
they will stop the car out of respect.

00:26:09.797 --> 00:26:11.730
There is so much respect for women there.

00:26:11.931 --> 00:26:14.670
But here in India, I do not understand why,

00:26:14.871 --> 00:26:17.178
the impact of the muslim culture has been the opposite.

00:26:17.379 --> 00:26:21.258
that we see women as an object to be exploited.

00:26:21.459 --> 00:26:23.208
They want to see every woman in their path,

00:26:23.409 --> 00:26:26.301
twisting the neck but continue staring.

00:26:26.502 --> 00:26:29.865
It is a big sin to stare at every woman.

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:33.499
In Sahaja Yoga, it is considered as an prohibited act.

00:26:33.667 --> 00:26:35.016
Absolutely prohibited.

00:26:35.217 --> 00:26:37.385
Firstly you will spoil your eyes.

00:26:37.568 --> 00:26:40.103
And being in Sahaja Yoga it will cause even more damage.

00:26:40.304 --> 00:26:44.658
If more damage does not happen, then you may even become blind.

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:49.108
Sometimes I see people have wandering eyes.

00:26:49.309 --> 00:26:51.966
They are talking to someone but eyes are wandering elsewhere.

00:26:52.133 --> 00:26:54.058
Nowadays, even women too are learning this.

00:26:54.259 --> 00:26:58.652
The biggest loss by doing this is your attention.

00:26:59.033 --> 00:27:02.112
If your attention goes here and there,

00:27:02.313 --> 00:27:04.299
if your attention goes here and there,

00:27:04.474 --> 00:27:06.621
then what's the use of Self-Realization?

00:27:06.822 --> 00:27:10.268
Because without focussing attention

00:27:10.467 --> 00:27:12.846
it can't become active.

00:27:13.047 --> 00:27:15.540
Focussed attention can only become active.

00:27:15.723 --> 00:27:17.966
A focussed attention must be attained.

00:27:18.167 --> 00:27:20.579
In the west, this disease is more among men.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:23.031
It's there in women also but not as much as in the men.

00:27:23.232 --> 00:27:25.545
So the western yogis asked me the cure for this disease.

00:27:25.746 --> 00:27:28.680
They are not like Indians, they do not think this is good thing.

00:27:28.881 --> 00:27:30.271
They consider it a negative thing.

00:27:30.472 --> 00:27:33.003
Since they came to Sahaj Yoga, they are asking Me to remove it.

00:27:33.204 --> 00:27:37.057
I told them to look only at the ground

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.883
and up to 3 feet on top.

00:27:40.084 --> 00:27:42.291
You have no need to see above that.

00:27:42.492 --> 00:27:44.177
Look at the ground while walking.

00:27:44.378 --> 00:27:48.152
So you will recognise Sahaja Yogis anywhere in the world.

00:27:48.353 --> 00:27:50.647
They are the ones walking with their eyes lowered.

00:27:50.848 --> 00:27:56.138
You see all good things below 3 feet, such as flowers and children.

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:58.944
Nothing good to see above.

00:28:01.041 --> 00:28:04.362
So, that's how you should control your attention.

00:28:04.563 --> 00:28:06.534
Now Shri Rama did not need to do this.

00:28:06.741 --> 00:28:10.198
However, if you have respect towards Shri Rama,

00:28:10.399 --> 00:28:14.947
you must control your attention like Him.

00:28:15.148 --> 00:28:20.291
Explain to your wife,

00:28:20.492 --> 00:28:22.982
that she is a shakti and you respect that quality.

00:28:23.183 --> 00:28:26.428
But she must also prove herself worthy of this respect.

00:28:26.629 --> 00:28:30.634
Like the shloka: "Yatra nāryastu pūjyanté ramanté tatra devatāḥ" -

00:28:30.835 --> 00:28:35.374
"Where women are worshipped, in such places do Gods reside."

00:28:35.581 --> 00:28:39.420
But those women must also be worth respecting.

00:28:42.023 --> 00:28:45.230
[to audience] What is it? Please sit down.

00:28:45.677 --> 00:28:49.749
Ok, sit down. One should not move around during the Puja.

00:28:50.384 --> 00:28:53.596
So if the woman is to be worshipped,

00:28:53.797 --> 00:28:56.040
she needs to be worthy of worship.

00:28:56.241 --> 00:28:58.568
Who would worship a dirty woman?

00:28:58.759 --> 00:29:01.177
Who would worship a cruel woman?

00:29:01.368 --> 00:29:04.111
Or someone with a demonic temperament? Will anyone worship?

00:29:04.312 --> 00:29:06.828
Only those who are worth of worship

00:29:07.031 --> 00:29:09.424
should be worshipped

00:29:09.625 --> 00:29:11.723
and only in that place God would reside as well.

00:29:11.924 --> 00:29:13.794
Firstly, men should realise

00:29:13.992 --> 00:29:17.260
that this lady is the mother of their children.

00:29:17.461 --> 00:29:21.530
If husband scolds or mocks his wife in front of children,

00:29:21.731 --> 00:29:23.477
gives her no respect,

00:29:23.668 --> 00:29:26.006
then children will never respect their mother.

00:29:26.207 --> 00:29:27.947
Think of it as a relationship

00:29:28.148 --> 00:29:30.496
between a prime minister and a deputy prime minister.

00:29:30.697 --> 00:29:33.253
Women should not insult their husbands as well.

00:29:33.454 --> 00:29:36.981
Like the delegation of authority from prime minister (father)

00:29:37.188 --> 00:29:38.671
to deputy (mother),

00:29:38.872 --> 00:29:41.231
it can be wrongly delegated to children by the father.

00:29:41.432 --> 00:29:46.435
But if the couple are such that they do not have this subtlety,

00:29:46.636 --> 00:29:49.752
then the lady feels she should dominate, the man feels he should.

00:29:49.953 --> 00:29:52.518
If woman understand how to handle her man,

00:29:52.719 --> 00:29:54.428
then there would not be any fights.

00:29:54.629 --> 00:29:58.052
You should understand that it's very easy to manage men,

00:29:58.253 --> 00:30:00.437
because they are like children.

00:30:00.638 --> 00:30:02.853
Its very easy to manage them.

00:30:03.054 --> 00:30:06.102
Their temperament is simple, like that of children.

00:30:06.303 --> 00:30:09.687
With arguments or by talking a lot, you can't handle them.

00:30:09.888 --> 00:30:13.199
You must also forgive them like you forgive children.

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.765
They go outside, have fights or arguments and return home stressed.

00:30:16.966 --> 00:30:18.711
And then carry this frustration home to the wife.

00:30:18.912 --> 00:30:20.746
If they express it outside they will get beaten.

00:30:20.947 --> 00:30:23.435
So the wife can sometimes ignore these outbursts.

00:30:23.636 --> 00:30:28.583
Until the wife has this attitude towards her husband,

00:30:28.784 --> 00:30:32.628
there cannot be mutual understanding, love and joy between them.

00:30:32.829 --> 00:30:36.530
However, the husband should also think about what wife needs

00:30:36.721 --> 00:30:38.816
and what does not.

00:30:39.017 --> 00:30:40.978
But this does not mean because she is the wife,

00:30:41.179 --> 00:30:43.838
she can say something wrong or give wrong advise.

00:30:44.039 --> 00:30:45.556
In this situation, he must tell her:

00:30:45.757 --> 00:30:47.789
"This is wrong, I won't do this".

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:50.536
"This is a lie. I won't do that."

00:30:50.737 --> 00:30:54.795
But no need to fight on small-small matters.

00:30:54.996 --> 00:30:57.149
And fighting on trivial issues,

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:59.371
does not behove a Sahaja Yogi.

00:30:59.572 --> 00:31:04.024
I am surprised when Sahaja couples keep on fighting.

00:31:04.207 --> 00:31:06.604
They come to complain about each other.

00:31:06.805 --> 00:31:10.623
If one Sahaja couple cannot stay peacefully with each other,

00:31:10.824 --> 00:31:15.890
then how can we talk about bringing love to the entire world?

00:31:16.091 --> 00:31:19.136
It will not work out, if you keep fighting like this.

00:31:19.337 --> 00:31:24.444
So first thing is, the husband must be fully in a way

00:31:24.645 --> 00:31:27.719
alert to the needs of his wife,

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:31.340
and know that all the other women in the world,

00:31:31.523 --> 00:31:34.491
are like his sisters and mother.

00:31:36.207 --> 00:31:38.454
If this does not manifest even after Sahaja Yoga

00:31:38.655 --> 00:31:40.842
then it cannot happen anywhere else.

00:31:41.043 --> 00:31:43.720
There was a gentleman,

00:31:44.561 --> 00:31:47.787
that too a Swiss person and not an Indian.

00:31:47.988 --> 00:31:51.320
He was a father of a Sahaja Yogini.

00:31:51.892 --> 00:31:55.920
Girl's husband had wandering eyes,

00:31:56.121 --> 00:31:58.565
although he had come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:58.766 --> 00:32:00.452
They both came to Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:00.653 --> 00:32:03.383
The girl was a very good, chaste girl.

00:32:03.584 --> 00:32:06.709
He continued with this behavior wherever he went.

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:09.138
So her father, who was not a Sahaja Yogi,

00:32:09.329 --> 00:32:11.939
told his daughter that it was better to leave him,

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:14.982
saying that, "If someone cannot be cleansed even with Sahaja yoga,

00:32:15.183 --> 00:32:18.170
then he can never be cleansed. You leave him".

00:32:18.371 --> 00:32:20.097
She said "He has improved slightly."

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.994
Father replied: "If he cannot be fully clean,

00:32:23.178 --> 00:32:27.079
he is not a Sahaja Yogi. Leave him and have no relations with him".

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:31.785
Even someone who is not a Sahaja Yogi can understand

00:32:31.986 --> 00:32:35.473
that if a person's eyes cannot be stable after Sahaja Yoga,

00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:39.222
if his attention does not become stable,

00:32:39.423 --> 00:32:42.158
then there is something wrong.

00:32:42.359 --> 00:32:44.833
Another key feature of our Indian culture

00:32:45.034 --> 00:32:47.605
is that men's and women's circle of social interactions

00:32:47.806 --> 00:32:49.814
should be restricted to brother and sister relationship.

00:32:50.015 --> 00:32:51.299
But this does not happen.

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:54.236
I see immeadiately frivolous women

00:32:54.388 --> 00:32:56.742
just falling over to talk to men.

00:32:56.943 --> 00:32:59.214
They will chatter on with the men.

00:32:59.461 --> 00:33:02.945
I do not understand the need.

00:33:03.146 --> 00:33:05.563
They will not sit together with other women but with men.

00:33:05.764 --> 00:33:07.947
Same with some men who are engrossed by women.

00:33:08.146 --> 00:33:11.215
They see some lady and start pursuing her -

00:33:11.416 --> 00:33:14.827
any woman, even if she is a house maid or anyone else.

00:33:15.028 --> 00:33:17.505
Anyone they can reach, they will pursue.

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:21.047
They have no self respect.

00:33:21.547 --> 00:33:23.582
They think this is manhood.

00:33:23.783 --> 00:33:26.603
but the pinnacle of manhood is Shri Rama.

00:33:26.786 --> 00:33:30.628
He is sitting up there, who is the epitome of manhood

00:33:30.829 --> 00:33:32.943
But the people who are at the lowest level,

00:33:33.126 --> 00:33:34.963
they think they represent perfect manhood.

00:33:35.146 --> 00:33:36.500
How can this be manhood?

00:33:36.701 --> 00:33:38.485
They should either not worship Shri Rama

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:40.308
and follow the devil instead,

00:33:40.509 --> 00:33:43.654
or if they actually believe in Shri Rama, they should follow His ideals.

00:33:43.855 --> 00:33:49.076
And that is why nowadays, children and women are getting spoiled.

00:33:49.277 --> 00:33:52.467
Even then, it's a unique feature of Indian culture

00:33:52.641 --> 00:33:54.672
that women have managed well.

00:33:54.873 --> 00:33:56.582
If they were like Americans women,

00:33:56.783 --> 00:33:59.353
then all of you would have been finished.

00:33:59.554 --> 00:34:02.898
In America, they have caused trouble

00:34:03.073 --> 00:34:04.887
and the men are in a pitiable state.

00:34:05.088 --> 00:34:09.679
I tell you there if a man gets married 2-3 times,

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:11.978
he is bankrupted

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:14.164
and if a lady marries 2-3 times,

00:34:14.365 --> 00:34:17.159
she will have the means to build a palace.

00:34:18.133 --> 00:34:19.255
So what's good there?

00:34:19.456 --> 00:34:22.178
Children run away from home. What is their social structure?

00:34:22.379 --> 00:34:24.630
So this is a speciality of our Indian women,

00:34:24.831 --> 00:34:26.825
because they have grown up in Indian traditions,

00:34:27.026 --> 00:34:31.129
they manage the house and children well, know their responsibility.

00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:32.862
But this is changing.

00:34:33.063 --> 00:34:37.045
They say, "If my husband does like this, so why cannot I"?

00:34:37.212 --> 00:34:39.373
They ask, "If he does this to me, why shouldn't I?".

00:34:39.574 --> 00:34:42.493
If he runs after 10 women, then we go with 15 men.

00:34:42.694 --> 00:34:46.909
They say, "If he is doing bad things and going to hell,

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:48.494
then I will go before him".

00:34:48.695 --> 00:34:50.340
Women should not talk like this.

00:34:50.516 --> 00:34:53.666
The foundation of dharma is in women's hands.

00:34:53.867 --> 00:34:55.282
Women must manage this.

00:34:55.483 --> 00:34:57.967
They must bring their husband on the path of dharma

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:01.317
by explaining and by cajoling him to keep him close.

00:35:01.518 --> 00:35:04.354
This is her biggest duty and she has this power in her.

00:35:04.537 --> 00:35:07.145
However, if she herself is not dharmic...

00:35:07.346 --> 00:35:09.554
In dharma, the biggest dharma is forgiveness.

00:35:09.752 --> 00:35:11.610
If she does not know how to forgive,

00:35:11.801 --> 00:35:14.743
then even if she follows any religion, it will be of no use.

00:35:14.944 --> 00:35:16.995
First thing she must have forgiveness.

00:35:17.226 --> 00:35:19.913
She should forgive her children, her husband,

00:35:20.114 --> 00:35:22.886
give refuge to people working in the house and everyone else.

00:35:23.053 --> 00:35:24.375
This is her duty.

00:35:24.576 --> 00:35:27.031
Some challenges come like this.

00:35:27.246 --> 00:35:28.814
Now see, this work that I am doing,

00:35:29.015 --> 00:35:32.642
even Shri Rama could not have done it, nor Shri Krishna,

00:35:32.843 --> 00:35:35.118
nor Lord Jesus.

00:35:35.319 --> 00:35:40.373
Had it been Shri Rama, he would cut everyone's head off.

00:35:40.574 --> 00:35:42.785
He would have killed everyone saying, "Now you go.

00:35:42.986 --> 00:35:44.768
You are useless, adharmic,

00:35:44.975 --> 00:35:48.128
you run after women, you are licentious, hence you go".

00:35:48.329 --> 00:35:51.407
Do not know how many he would be finished right away?

00:35:51.608 --> 00:35:55.426
Second, if Shri Krishna came, He would have used his sudarshan chakra.

00:35:55.633 --> 00:35:57.379
That too would have spoilt the situation.

00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:00.473
Had Lord Christ came, He would have allowed Himself to be crucified.

00:36:00.674 --> 00:36:03.513
This is very good - go for crucifixion once, work is done.

00:36:03.704 --> 00:36:06.556
Better than being crucified everyday.

00:36:06.757 --> 00:36:08.903
Only a Mother can do this work.

00:36:09.125 --> 00:36:12.793
Only a Mother can do it, because of Her power of love is so strong,

00:36:12.994 --> 00:36:17.385
that anything can be worked out by relying on Her power of love.

00:36:17.586 --> 00:36:19.302
She takes up everything

00:36:19.486 --> 00:36:21.555
and her ways are so endearing

00:36:21.756 --> 00:36:24.131
that children do not react negatively on being corrected by her.

00:36:24.332 --> 00:36:26.755
Suppose something happens, something goes wrong,

00:36:26.936 --> 00:36:29.332
it's the mother who knows how to handle it.

00:36:29.533 --> 00:36:31.444
She may scold the children later.

00:36:31.645 --> 00:36:35.101
As they know that mother loves them, scolds them for their benefit

00:36:35.302 --> 00:36:36.959
and hence they do not grudge it.

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:40.747
With father scolding, children may react but not with mother's.

00:36:40.938 --> 00:36:44.351
Because her love is without any self-interest.

00:36:44.552 --> 00:36:46.338
She does not want anything for herself.

00:36:46.537 --> 00:36:49.987
She wants that her children should be good, get all her powers,

00:36:50.188 --> 00:36:53.438
gain everything good that exists inside her.

00:36:53.639 --> 00:36:56.750
If a mother has these feelings

00:36:57.345 --> 00:36:58.877
then her children will turn out fine.

00:36:59.078 --> 00:37:02.360
But many mothers are very forward, abrasive,

00:37:02.561 --> 00:37:06.020
get involved in everything, will speak on everything.

00:37:06.221 --> 00:37:08.366
The poor husband will keep sitting quietly.

00:37:08.596 --> 00:37:10.419
while she will be standing in the front.

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:13.239
When this happens, then children will become spoiled.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.175
Growing under such a adverse environment,

00:37:16.376 --> 00:37:19.179
children can grow up to be destructive,

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:21.603
which can be very harmful.

00:37:21.804 --> 00:37:24.788
The lady, being the potential energy, should be behind

00:37:24.989 --> 00:37:26.636
and keep her husband in front.

00:37:26.837 --> 00:37:29.111
Its ok. Whatever the husband does,

00:37:29.286 --> 00:37:31.251
the wife must help him from behind.

00:37:31.452 --> 00:37:36.591
The source of his power is wife - this you must understand.

00:37:36.798 --> 00:37:40.523
Therefore how pure and hard-working the lady needs to be.

00:37:40.724 --> 00:37:43.092
You will say that Mother is leaving all the onus on the women.

00:37:43.293 --> 00:37:45.273
I do this because I know you are very powerful,

00:37:45.474 --> 00:37:47.487
I know we women have many powers.

00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:48.858
Because I am Myself a Mother.

00:37:49.059 --> 00:37:52.442
Now see, it's been left to Me to redeem thousands,

00:37:52.643 --> 00:37:54.006
to cure so many diseases.

00:37:54.212 --> 00:37:56.275
From morning to evening, I am curing sick people.

00:37:56.476 --> 00:37:59.065
After that, give them Realisation. Did anyone work like this?

00:37:59.266 --> 00:38:02.612
Only Ahilya was saved (by Lord Rama) and that was it.

00:38:02.813 --> 00:38:05.877
Lord Christ cured in total only about 21 people.

00:38:06.078 --> 00:38:09.104
I must have cured 21,000 people by now.

00:38:09.305 --> 00:38:14.243
I roam around the planet, doing this or that work for everyone.

00:38:14.444 --> 00:38:16.456
It's still going on, but I do not feel it's work,

00:38:16.657 --> 00:38:20.701
because it's the power of love. This power of love runs ahead of Me.

00:38:20.902 --> 00:38:24.283
Now, before going outside I think of taking a bandhan,

00:38:24.484 --> 00:38:26.569
as I don't know what kind of people touch My feet.

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:28.164
But I forget doing this.

00:38:28.365 --> 00:38:30.532
As soon as a troubled person comes in front of Me,

00:38:30.731 --> 00:38:32.420
I absorb all their problems.

00:38:32.621 --> 00:38:35.954
The love is like that - it acts on its own.

00:38:36.201 --> 00:38:39.857
I know that it is this love acting and doing all the work.

00:38:40.058 --> 00:38:42.432
I do not feel bad about this. Whatever is happening is ok.

00:38:42.647 --> 00:38:45.222
There will be some discomfort, let it happen.

00:38:45.405 --> 00:38:47.076
All this only a Mother can do.

00:38:47.277 --> 00:38:50.474
Therefore, I have my special attention on you,

00:38:50.673 --> 00:38:55.291
that you do work in a peaceful and steady manner.

00:38:55.492 --> 00:39:01.393
Also men need to now fully support their women,

00:39:01.594 --> 00:39:03.898
fully understand and respect them.

00:39:04.099 --> 00:39:09.893
Until the two wheels of a chariot are of the same size,

00:39:10.084 --> 00:39:11.862
it goes around in circles.

00:39:12.053 --> 00:39:14.351
It does not go forward.

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:17.868
They both should be the similar,

00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:21.400
but one is for the left and the other for the right.

00:39:21.601 --> 00:39:25.751
The left wheel will not fit on the right side, nor the opposite way.

00:39:25.952 --> 00:39:28.135
That is why there are two types of wheel.

00:39:28.318 --> 00:39:31.682
These both types of wheel are working well

00:39:31.877 --> 00:39:35.626
because they are alike in some sense

00:39:35.817 --> 00:39:38.618
and not alike in another sense.

00:39:39.495 --> 00:39:41.896
Compared to each other

00:39:43.635 --> 00:39:49.261
they are similar in sense of height, length and width

00:39:49.444 --> 00:39:53.893
but they work differently.

00:39:54.352 --> 00:39:58.814
Similarly, this happens in our life.

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.646
So Shri Ramachandra ji

00:40:01.847 --> 00:40:05.910
did not think only about the husband and wife.

00:40:11.382 --> 00:40:16.515
He did not also only think about His children and the dynasty.

00:40:17.165 --> 00:40:22.430
He thought about everyone, his brother, sister, mother, father etc.,

00:40:22.922 --> 00:40:25.978
just like a normal human being should.

00:40:26.179 --> 00:40:32.275
After that, He thought about society as well.

00:40:32.807 --> 00:40:34.795
He thought about the general public,

00:40:34.994 --> 00:40:36.677
about the country,

00:40:36.878 --> 00:40:38.716
and kingdom.

00:40:38.917 --> 00:40:43.791
Across His life, in all normal and typical human activities,

00:40:43.974 --> 00:40:50.043
He showed how a human should ideally behave.

00:40:50.244 --> 00:40:53.250
The man who loved His wife so much,

00:40:53.457 --> 00:40:59.345
left Her despite knowing that She was completely pure.

00:41:00.458 --> 00:41:02.585
Nowadays, they make properties for the wife

00:41:02.786 --> 00:41:06.955
or the wife needs this or that thing or wants to built something.

00:41:07.156 --> 00:41:11.638
And if it's said, give 2 paisa to the poor then will not.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:15.752
Otherwise they give to their childen, nephews etc.

00:41:15.953 --> 00:41:17.990
It is a disease among the ruling class.

00:41:18.191 --> 00:41:21.978
And Shri Rama, He renounced even such a wife

00:41:22.179 --> 00:41:27.752
who was the incarnation of the Devi and extremely pure.

00:41:27.953 --> 00:41:31.717
Then we must re-think about our attachments,

00:41:31.918 --> 00:41:34.682
about our relationships or properties.

00:41:34.883 --> 00:41:36.603
And some people are just...

00:41:36.786 --> 00:41:39.606
Previously in the West, husband-wife relation was not good.

00:41:39.807 --> 00:41:43.566
After Sahaja Yoga relation is good, but the wife became everything.

00:41:43.767 --> 00:41:46.697
In our collective, at least 4-5 leaders had to leave Sahaja Yoga,

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.008
because of their wives.

00:41:49.209 --> 00:41:51.696
Because the wife was not good, though the husband was good.

00:41:51.897 --> 00:41:56.212
Their wife brainwashed them, leading to their ruin.

00:41:56.413 --> 00:42:00.461
At least five yogis went out because of their wives.

00:42:01.003 --> 00:42:05.821
So even here I would say, that the wives should understand

00:42:06.012 --> 00:42:08.308
what Sahaja Yoga is

00:42:08.509 --> 00:42:11.745
and what is their place in it.

00:42:12.086 --> 00:42:14.451
And the husband too, in such situations,

00:42:14.652 --> 00:42:17.586
should not agree to his wife at all.

00:42:17.787 --> 00:42:22.982
Should tell her that, “You talk and run about too much. Be quiet!

00:42:23.652 --> 00:42:27.072
You are of no use. Your chakras are not alright".

00:42:27.273 --> 00:42:30.391
When the husband responds to her like that,

00:42:30.592 --> 00:42:32.223
only then will she become alright.

00:42:32.424 --> 00:42:35.333
Instead you accept to spoil your chakras, if she spoils hers.

00:42:35.534 --> 00:42:38.326
If she says, "Do this", then you do that.

00:42:38.527 --> 00:42:41.421
If she tells you to steal money, then you do it.

00:42:41.622 --> 00:42:43.723
Even after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:42:43.924 --> 00:42:46.808
your subtle catches still stick on.

00:42:47.009 --> 00:42:49.950
In this you must give full attention.

00:42:50.151 --> 00:42:51.775
On the occasion of Shri Rama today,

00:42:51.976 --> 00:42:54.467
we must reflect on Shri Hanuman,

00:42:54.681 --> 00:43:00.148
how He was so devoted to Shri Rama

00:43:01.112 --> 00:43:04.942
and how He was busy at His service and disposal.

00:43:05.685 --> 00:43:10.249
And being all the time at Shri Rama's service,

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:16.519
He knew that His entire life would have significance.

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:24.158
We should also adopt Shri Hanuman's wisdom in Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:24.868 --> 00:43:26.551
This does not mean

00:43:26.758 --> 00:43:29.858
that you keep on cooking and sending food for Me. Absolutely not.

00:43:30.059 --> 00:43:31.697
Because I hardly eat anything

00:43:31.898 --> 00:43:35.380
and by cooking too much, you put Me in a difficult situation.

00:43:35.581 --> 00:43:37.801
One person sends some dish, another something else.

00:43:38.002 --> 00:43:40.697
Like it is said that food should be offered to God first,

00:43:40.904 --> 00:43:43.825
but for a God who does not eat, why trouble Her with food?

00:43:44.026 --> 00:43:45.968
Food is not needed. Nothing is needed.

00:43:46.191 --> 00:43:49.879
What is required is a commitment to serve without any delay.

00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:53.474
Did Shri Hanuman ever cook and send food to Shri Rama?

00:43:53.675 --> 00:43:56.925
Delhi people have bothered Me so much cooking for Me all the time,

00:43:57.126 --> 00:43:58.663
that I have stipulated

00:43:58.846 --> 00:44:02.283
that if they cook anymore, I would not come to Delhi.

00:44:03.474 --> 00:44:06.379
Do what is required.

00:44:06.881 --> 00:44:11.014
It is useless to force food on someone who does not eat.

00:44:11.215 --> 00:44:14.624
Or for someone without any needs, getting bangles or something else.

00:44:14.825 --> 00:44:16.489
Your Mother does not need anything.

00:44:16.672 --> 00:44:19.021
My house is full. I am troubled by all this.

00:44:19.222 --> 00:44:22.158
I say that get only flowers and nothing else.

00:44:22.359 --> 00:44:24.031
I need nothing. Flowers are enough.

00:44:24.222 --> 00:44:26.766
And decoration with flowers should not be of thousands rupees.

00:44:26.967 --> 00:44:29.388
Today you have decorated flowers modestly, not too much.

00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:33.823
Sometimes I'm worried with how many flowers you put on the stage.

00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:37.711
So do things in balance, so that your Mother will appreciate it.

00:44:37.912 --> 00:44:42.243
Your Mother is simple. She has no appreciation for these things.

00:44:43.064 --> 00:44:48.424
So I want to emphasise, that you need to learn from Shri Hanuman,

00:44:48.625 --> 00:44:50.487
to find contentment in serving.

00:44:50.688 --> 00:44:52.622
So what service is specifically needed?

00:44:52.805 --> 00:44:55.492
I need no special service.

00:44:55.693 --> 00:44:58.918
I am healthy and need not much service.

00:44:59.119 --> 00:45:03.583
However, if you want to serve Me, then do service to Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:04.431 --> 00:45:07.685
Whoever will be serving in Sahaja Yoga, will be serving Me.

00:45:07.886 --> 00:45:10.162
How many people have you given Realisation?

00:45:10.363 --> 00:45:12.566
How many women have you given Realisation to?

00:45:12.767 --> 00:45:16.064
How many did you transform? How many did you take interest in?

00:45:16.265 --> 00:45:18.099
Whenever someone new comes to the program

00:45:18.329 --> 00:45:21.310
yogis say, "You have this or that possession", they get after him.

00:45:21.509 --> 00:45:22.577
So he runs away.

00:45:22.778 --> 00:45:26.375
I asked a gentleman, "You got your Realisation. Why did you leave?"

00:45:26.576 --> 00:45:27.925
He said that after the program,

00:45:28.093 --> 00:45:31.291
yogis told him he had three possessions inside.

00:45:32.638 --> 00:45:35.628
He was even told the number of bhoots.

00:45:38.027 --> 00:45:39.946
I asked him why did he believe the yogi?

00:45:40.137 --> 00:45:42.115
He said that he seemed like an authority

00:45:42.316 --> 00:45:45.895
and came running to tell him that he had three possessions.

00:45:46.096 --> 00:45:49.187
I do not know who said that to him, but the newcomer ran away.

00:45:49.388 --> 00:45:52.055
So in Sahaja Yoga,

00:45:52.254 --> 00:45:55.672
what we need to learn from Shri Hanuman is His eagerness.

00:45:55.873 --> 00:45:59.487
"Ram kaj karne ko tatpar" (eager to do Shri Rama's work).

00:45:59.688 --> 00:46:01.492
What is our kaj (work)?

00:46:01.667 --> 00:46:03.961
"My work is Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:04.162 --> 00:46:06.687
My work is Sahaja Yoga,

00:46:06.888 --> 00:46:09.888
to raise the Kundalini, to give Realisation to people,

00:46:10.089 --> 00:46:13.449
to get peace and love in them,

00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:17.672
to talk about love.

00:46:19.195 --> 00:46:24.616
explaining about all chakras etc. in Sahaja Yoga,

00:46:24.817 --> 00:46:26.756
whatever they need - to explain that".

00:46:26.957 --> 00:46:30.233
Now when I said this, people started giving long lectures.

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:33.792
Some people started giving so many lectures

00:46:33.993 --> 00:46:37.578
that I had to tell them to stop

00:46:37.779 --> 00:46:39.720
otherwise the other yogis will be finished.

00:46:39.921 --> 00:46:42.587
People complained that they lecture for 2 hours.

00:46:42.786 --> 00:46:45.632
There is no time to hear Your talk and do Aarti.

00:46:45.833 --> 00:46:47.459
We have to go home just with this.

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:49.560
So I had that person's lecture stopped.

00:46:49.761 --> 00:46:52.394
He said that when I go then he doesn't know what happens to him.

00:46:52.595 --> 00:46:56.639
He told Me, "I feel like giving a lecture. How can I correct this?".

00:46:56.840 --> 00:47:00.031
I told him, "You put supari (betel nut) in your mouth."

00:47:00.232 --> 00:47:04.222
"How large the nut should be?" - he asked Me.

00:47:05.304 --> 00:47:08.966
I said, "It depends on the size of your mouth.

00:47:09.167 --> 00:47:12.187
If you do not even know how big should be the betel nut,

00:47:12.388 --> 00:47:14.691
then what do you talk about Sahaja Yoga?

00:47:14.892 --> 00:47:17.868
You do not have this wisdom either".

00:47:18.423 --> 00:47:20.799
People like talking a lot in Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.386
They think they have got a platform to give lectures.

00:47:23.587 --> 00:47:27.361
They have got the mike and want to speak. Cannot leave the mike.

00:47:27.562 --> 00:47:29.934
Once they got hold of the mic they cannot leave it.

00:47:30.165 --> 00:47:32.769
This is a new disease.

00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:37.341
So you must understand, "Why to give a lecture?

00:47:37.532 --> 00:47:40.116
There are so many of Mother's lectures, listen to those only".

00:47:40.317 --> 00:47:43.236
So whenever you have a function,

00:47:43.437 --> 00:47:47.206
display a video of Mine

00:47:47.385 --> 00:47:49.226
or play My tapes.

00:47:49.427 --> 00:47:54.310
Give pencil and paper to people, after, to write their questions.

00:47:54.511 --> 00:47:57.762
Then you give them Realisation

00:47:58.402 --> 00:48:01.911
and ask them to write any of their problems and bring it next time,

00:48:02.112 --> 00:48:06.412
any problem in the beginning like someone is sick or in trouble.

00:48:06.625 --> 00:48:08.691
Now there are also people like this -

00:48:08.889 --> 00:48:13.021
there is one person, he would even come to Calcutta to cure someone.

00:48:13.222 --> 00:48:15.432
Now he will go...

00:48:15.615 --> 00:48:20.551
Now people are inviting him to come to Russia to cure people.

00:48:20.752 --> 00:48:24.940
One person only is running from here to there like Shri Hanuman.

00:48:25.141 --> 00:48:26.980
All of you can cure.

00:48:27.155 --> 00:48:29.405
All of you can cure everyone.

00:48:29.606 --> 00:48:31.949
All women can do it, all men can do it as well,

00:48:32.172 --> 00:48:34.065
but no one tries.

00:48:34.266 --> 00:48:38.381
By giving lectures how many have been cured?

00:48:38.582 --> 00:48:42.542
I don't know why there is only one person in India

00:48:42.718 --> 00:48:44.230
who can cure people,

00:48:44.431 --> 00:48:49.015
while in London there are 15-20 people who can cure

00:48:49.285 --> 00:48:51.524
and there are in France as well.

00:48:51.725 --> 00:48:55.192
One should learn the technique to clear people.

00:48:55.414 --> 00:48:57.860
Take a bandhan and do it.

00:48:58.061 --> 00:49:01.118
For this, will you call people from outside?

00:49:01.319 --> 00:49:03.144
For what purpose are you a Sahaja Yogi?

00:49:03.345 --> 00:49:06.652
You roam around wearing a badge of Sahaja Yoga but cannot even cure.

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.541
Then, remove the badge.

00:49:08.742 --> 00:49:12.211
You cannot even clear yourself or cure your diseases,

00:49:12.412 --> 00:49:13.780
so how will you cure others?

00:49:13.981 --> 00:49:19.659
I must tell you that everybody has got all the power to cure anyone.

00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:22.513
You must learn this. You must master it.

00:49:22.714 --> 00:49:25.587
Instead of inviting someone to Calcutta,

00:49:25.778 --> 00:49:28.451
people from Calcutta should go out to cure.

00:49:28.652 --> 00:49:31.417
It's a matter of a little courage. Nohting will happen to you.

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:34.333
Neither can you get sick or anything else can happen.

00:49:34.534 --> 00:49:37.601
The more you work in Sahaja Yoga, the deeper you will become.

00:49:37.802 --> 00:49:42.428
Because the wider the tree is, the deeper its roots are.

00:49:44.586 --> 00:49:49.679
Between Sahaja Yoga and work of other incarnations,

00:49:49.878 --> 00:49:52.191
there is one major difference.

00:49:52.392 --> 00:49:57.179
The other incarnations had never worked in society before.

00:49:57.380 --> 00:49:59.846
Nobody had got these powers.

00:50:00.164 --> 00:50:01.851
It was not for the masses.

00:50:02.052 --> 00:50:04.624
Only one or two people had attained this power.

00:50:04.825 --> 00:50:07.937
Like King Janaka who gave Realisation to Nachiketa.

00:50:08.138 --> 00:50:10.677
But now you all have got this power.

00:50:10.878 --> 00:50:16.567
Now just grow in such a manner that you do not need anything else.

00:50:17.079 --> 00:50:20.515
You can cure yourself, you can cure others.

00:50:20.722 --> 00:50:23.829
You can understand Sahaja Yoga. You have everything you need.

00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:27.045
But even now your attention is wandering.

00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:29.510
I do not understand, what are you running after?

00:50:29.711 --> 00:50:32.519
You have still not grasped this.

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:36.233
In Sahaja Yoga, for everyone there is nothing but blessings.

00:50:36.434 --> 00:50:40.502
You will not have any shortage of anything.

00:50:40.703 --> 00:50:43.618
That is if you contribute to something in Sahaja Yoga.

00:50:43.819 --> 00:50:45.886
Even if you do not work, you will get blessings.

00:50:46.087 --> 00:50:49.633
Whoever I see, his business increased or career progressed,

00:50:49.824 --> 00:50:52.242
this or that worked out for him.

00:50:52.443 --> 00:50:56.104
Everyone is continously receiving something or the other.

00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:59.173
There was no sacrifice needed.

00:50:59.374 --> 00:51:01.270
On the other hand, let me tell you

00:51:01.471 --> 00:51:04.785
when the freedom struggle in India happened,

00:51:04.986 --> 00:51:08.011
even we were troubled so much.

00:51:08.275 --> 00:51:10.856
made to lie down on ice, given electric shocks.

00:51:11.057 --> 00:51:15.393
My father and mother went to jail so many times. Our house was sold.

00:51:15.594 --> 00:51:18.171
We started living in a hut... our cars were also sold.

00:51:18.372 --> 00:51:22.204
We sacrified so much. You do not have to do anything like that.

00:51:23.266 --> 00:51:26.238
But it should not be only receiving all the time.

00:51:26.453 --> 00:51:27.997
You need to give as well.

00:51:28.198 --> 00:51:30.759
If one door is open,

00:51:31.196 --> 00:51:33.450
you should open another one as well.

00:51:33.696 --> 00:51:35.877
Keeping only one door open does not make the air flow.

00:51:36.078 --> 00:51:38.770
Everyone tells Me that "I received this blessing or that blessing".

00:51:38.969 --> 00:51:42.199
What benevolence have you done to others?

00:51:43.634 --> 00:51:45.644
We must pay attention to this aspect:

00:51:45.845 --> 00:51:50.301
"What benevolent action did we do?".

00:51:50.502 --> 00:51:53.873
But there are many fights for leadership.

00:51:54.117 --> 00:51:56.744
Who will be the leader? Many big fights.

00:51:56.903 --> 00:51:59.432
There is a readymade platform so people want to lead.

00:51:59.639 --> 00:52:02.836
You should know that all this is Mother's play.

00:52:03.037 --> 00:52:06.911
You will not know the day that you fall from there.

00:52:07.112 --> 00:52:10.249
Specially women should not get involved in leadership politics.

00:52:10.456 --> 00:52:13.755
They will fall from the top to the bottom immediately.

00:52:13.956 --> 00:52:18.710
And men should also understand, that there is no leader as such.

00:52:18.911 --> 00:52:22.467
This is a game made by Mother and do not get entangled in this.

00:52:22.668 --> 00:52:26.028
So I said that, "Let the leaders come forward". Leaders of what?

00:52:26.266 --> 00:52:28.515
All this is a game made by the Mother.

00:52:28.716 --> 00:52:30.563
There are no leaders.

00:52:30.764 --> 00:52:34.378
This is just a test of your wisdom.

00:52:34.579 --> 00:52:38.221
If you ego rises due to leadership, then you are gone.

00:52:39.284 --> 00:52:40.816
It will be revealed immediately.

00:52:40.975 --> 00:52:45.523
In Sahaja Yoga nothing is hidden. Everything is exposed.

00:52:46.024 --> 00:52:48.995
Even if I say something or not,

00:52:49.196 --> 00:52:52.526
they will expose their faces by themselves, on their own.

00:52:52.727 --> 00:52:56.535
He says, "I am the leader" - and tomorrow he will shame himself. Why?

00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:58.858
They say that they did this bad thing.

00:52:59.059 --> 00:53:02.376
So the leader has greater responsibility

00:53:02.544 --> 00:53:07.234
to be better, sweet, humble and loving than others

00:53:08.381 --> 00:53:12.491
and taking everyone along, consulting them and moving forward.

00:53:12.692 --> 00:53:17.070
Now on the auspicious occasion of Shri Rama special day today,

00:53:17.271 --> 00:53:21.827
we should pray for all qualities demonstrated in His life.

00:53:22.049 --> 00:53:24.339
If you can do only even a fraction of what He did,

00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:27.872
your Mother's life would be most worthwhile.

00:53:28.073 --> 00:53:30.989
He was in exile in the jungle for so many days.

00:53:31.188 --> 00:53:38.727
He wandered in jungles barefeet, did so much hard work.

00:53:38.928 --> 00:53:42.692
And He did this just to obey the order of His father.

00:53:42.893 --> 00:53:46.847
Now to obey Me, you need not to go into the forest for exile.

00:53:47.048 --> 00:53:50.398
Nor to be barefeet or go hungry. Nothing at all.

00:53:50.589 --> 00:53:52.173
Everything is ok.

00:53:52.374 --> 00:53:56.183
But in Sahaja Yoga, you must know how to cure people

00:53:56.381 --> 00:53:58.601
and their diseases.

00:53:58.802 --> 00:54:02.122
And you should have complete knowledge about Sahaja Yoga.

00:54:02.323 --> 00:54:04.327
and most importantly you should know,

00:54:04.526 --> 00:54:06.721
that Sahaja Yoga is love.

00:54:06.922 --> 00:54:10.696
It is the power of love that is working things out and no one else.

00:54:10.897 --> 00:54:14.481
Because of that power, everyone can prosper.

00:54:14.682 --> 00:54:17.115
This is not for one person

00:54:17.322 --> 00:54:21.021
or for any special people.

00:54:21.222 --> 00:54:23.611
This is neither for any one country

00:54:23.812 --> 00:54:28.000
but for the whole world.

00:54:28.978 --> 00:54:33.004
We should see also is how our attention is and where does it go.

00:54:33.218 --> 00:54:37.742
If again and again it wanders, we should restrain it, stop it.

00:54:37.943 --> 00:54:40.897
Fill the power of Spirit in your attention.

00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:44.977
And a person should do every task with unwavering attention.

00:54:45.178 --> 00:54:48.479
The person who will do this with devotion and love,

00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:51.164
will go very deep.

00:54:51.656 --> 00:54:58.161
Or if not, there is anyways a lot of rubbish around.

00:54:58.531 --> 00:55:03.878
And you know how garbage is finally disposed off.

00:55:04.079 --> 00:55:06.518
So if you want to become garbage

00:55:06.719 --> 00:55:08.676
and you feel that you are very special,

00:55:08.892 --> 00:55:11.332
you are very good and can do this or that...

00:55:11.533 --> 00:55:14.257
First thing is humility,

00:55:14.606 --> 00:55:17.556
not only towards Me but towards everyone.

00:55:17.757 --> 00:55:21.307
Talk humbly and with love.

00:55:21.561 --> 00:55:27.107
You will see how an ordinary human, who is useless,

00:55:27.308 --> 00:55:30.271
can blossom like a lotus in Sahaja Yoga.

00:55:30.472 --> 00:55:32.732
And his fragrance spreads in all four direction.

00:55:32.933 --> 00:55:34.732
People come and tell Me immediately,

00:55:34.933 --> 00:55:38.758
"Mother, he is a wonderful person, he is indeed like this".

00:55:38.959 --> 00:55:41.503
Like that you should work.

00:55:41.704 --> 00:55:44.671
Like people say about Maryada Purushottama that He was wonderful,

00:55:44.846 --> 00:55:46.573
similarly they will say about you.

00:55:46.774 --> 00:55:50.067
The biggest thing is that for Me, you are the temple of Shri Rama

00:55:50.274 --> 00:55:52.521
and you have to develop this temple within you.

00:55:52.722 --> 00:55:55.621
Let it be worshipped. Take care of it.

00:55:55.828 --> 00:55:59.219
Watch it and live with your self-esteem intact.

00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:05.598
Take the full benefit

00:56:05.773 --> 00:56:08.317
of your Self-Realization.

00:56:08.518 --> 00:56:12.750
Along with that, you must have full respect and devotion towards it.

00:56:12.951 --> 00:56:16.250
You should think, "Now we are realized. How can we do this?"

00:56:16.451 --> 00:56:18.562
"We are yogis. We cannot do this.

00:56:18.763 --> 00:56:21.164
This cannot be done by us as this is wrong."

00:56:21.365 --> 00:56:25.520
You will see that you will receive blessings immediately,

00:56:26.127 --> 00:56:27.831
immediately, at that time.

00:56:28.032 --> 00:56:31.010
People are calling me Rokhra (money) Devi,

00:56:31.225 --> 00:56:34.158
as they decide something and money come in for that.

00:56:34.359 --> 00:56:37.699
So many results, so much benefits everyone is getting.

00:56:37.890 --> 00:56:42.858
Now based on your blessings, pass them to the world as well.

00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:50.278
Like Shri Rama used all His powers for the benevolence of people

00:56:50.479 --> 00:56:54.091
and for the world to see an ideal man,

00:56:54.292 --> 00:56:57.281
the embodiment of an ideal man.

00:56:57.482 --> 00:57:01.686
Whenever this occurs inside us, you will be surprised,

00:57:01.854 --> 00:57:05.106
what level you will reach.

00:57:05.307 --> 00:57:09.074
You should not have any disease left. All diseases should go away.

00:57:09.275 --> 00:57:13.141
Clear off everything. All bad habits should be dropped.

00:57:13.342 --> 00:57:17.191
Eat what is needed, talk as much as needed.

00:57:17.392 --> 00:57:19.530
Witness everything

00:57:19.731 --> 00:57:21.778
and for this you must look inward.

00:57:21.979 --> 00:57:27.866
You should have a perceptive mind and introspect,

00:57:28.065 --> 00:57:30.011
that is looking inside yourself,

00:57:30.212 --> 00:57:31.831
looking inside yourself -

00:57:32.032 --> 00:57:33.864
"antar nirikshan" (internal inspection).

00:57:34.065 --> 00:57:37.523
Keep on watching, "What am I doing? Why am I doing this or that?

00:57:37.726 --> 00:57:39.333
What should I be doing?

00:57:39.534 --> 00:57:42.479
There is no need for this. I am a Sahaja Yogi. Why am I doing this?

00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:45.409
Where is my mind going? Stop it."

00:57:45.918 --> 00:57:49.614
By doing this all the time, you will get into meditation.

00:57:49.815 --> 00:57:53.092
And on its own, your Kundalini will be pleased with this

00:57:53.293 --> 00:57:56.036
and bless you with a lot of contentment,

00:57:56.237 --> 00:57:58.850
that you will say, "Mother, what a blessing I have received!"

00:57:59.022 --> 00:58:03.725
But only when you jump into it, you know what it is.

00:58:03.926 --> 00:58:07.996
Jumping into it is the only small bit of hard work.

00:58:08.197 --> 00:58:12.016
Shri Rama was born at midnight,

00:58:12.217 --> 00:58:14.841
so I had said, "Let's have the Puja at leisure". So that's how it is.

00:58:15.042 --> 00:58:18.039
In Shri Rama's Puja, there is not much work

00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:21.488
as is not very elaborate or long.

00:58:21.689 --> 00:58:24.130
But there is certainly something to understand,

00:58:24.321 --> 00:58:26.461
because He was in human form,

00:58:26.662 --> 00:58:28.632
so being in human form,

00:58:28.833 --> 00:58:35.358
He represents the humanity within us

00:58:35.559 --> 00:58:37.759
through which we understand the world,

00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:43.828
through which our intellect, our interest and our thoughts

00:58:44.074 --> 00:58:45.861
get changed.

00:58:46.062 --> 00:58:48.748
All these things are Shri Rama.

00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:53.131
Only through Him, can our ideas change.

00:58:53.332 --> 00:58:56.442
Only through Him, can our nature change

00:58:56.643 --> 00:58:59.301
because He is our ideal.

00:58:59.502 --> 00:59:01.910
Only after achieving Him as an ideal,

00:59:02.111 --> 00:59:04.298
you can reach other higher ideals

00:59:04.499 --> 00:59:06.822
as He was the ideal human being.

00:59:07.023 --> 00:59:08.365
It is such a big thing,

00:59:08.587 --> 00:59:11.253
that God decided to come to this world in a human form

00:59:11.454 --> 00:59:13.204
to became our ideal.

00:59:13.405 --> 00:59:16.264
He went through all hardships and adversity,

00:59:16.463 --> 00:59:20.330
to show us that despite any adversity,

00:59:20.537 --> 00:59:22.761
a person should not abandon his Dharma.

00:59:22.962 --> 00:59:25.173
You should not leave the path of Vishwa Dharma

00:59:25.374 --> 00:59:28.280
and maintain your state of yoga.

00:59:28.481 --> 00:59:32.292
My unending blessings to you all.
