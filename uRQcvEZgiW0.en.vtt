[UNCLEAR] very close to Left Swadhishthan, very close to Left Swadhishthan.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:18.620
See this [UNCLEAR N INAUDIBLE]

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:28.320
- We've felt quite often we have our open right heart.
- Right heart?

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.300
Right heart will be those people, who came and killed many people

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.720
This was a major center of colonizing [UNCLEAR]

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:51.260
- the organizing for the colonizing of countries started from this. It was all...
- Did they come here to the Spaniards or...?

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:58.040
- The money was here, the banks were here, the organizers were here
- Oh, I see, that's how..

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.520
- That sorted [UNCLEAR]
- Oh,
- and even when the government shifted to Wellington, it was still

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.720
- it was still Auckland which ...
- worked it out.
- [UNCLEAR]

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.580
I feel that, you see, all things, these things are of

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.340
the past and we have a special category of human-beings born now-a-days.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.340
- Come to the Feet.
- You can now use that one, if you want.
-  ..... while they're decorating the Feet [UNCLEAR]

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.580
- Now you can put it there in there, in that.
- [UNCLEAR]
- Yeah

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.880
All the colors of My feet are there - yellow and the red.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.880
- What's that flower is?
- It's [UNCLEAR]
- Annh?

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.740
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes. You don't get this in India.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.320
[UNCLEAR] they always [UNCLEAR]

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.000
But the vibrations are like that.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.640
- This is Warren's idea.
- What is his idea?

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.060
[UNCLEAR - SAREE IS THE...?]

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:31.140
.- May God bless you!
- Mother, it's a great privilege for us to have You here.
- May God...

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.500
Ladies can also [UNCLEAR]

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:45.020
Such a great thing! I was just thinking - normally, I could never have thought of New Zealand being visited, but for you

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.340
and for your efforts.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:57.180
Yes, you all have to go for it in a double way.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.280
- Warren wanted to be [UNCLEAR]
- What is [UNCLEAR]

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.520
- Probably, they got it in the same amount that they had - everything - so many; They'll show you all of them.
- We decided to buy among those [UNCLEAR]

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.340
for Mother, for the marriages in Sydney. We had enough left time to buy

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.820
something to go with it for New Zealand [UNCLEAR].

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.060
- Mother, for presenting [UNCLEAR]
- Alright - the price has to be removed.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.820
- Just take the tag out.
- You have to double it, you have to double it

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.900
This is a nice color. What do you call this color? Is this we call it onion color - pyaji

00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:00.560
- Mushroom
- Mushroom
- Mushroom? Mushrooms have this color?

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:08.140
- Yes, yes.
- Do they? Alright.
- The beauty, isn't it, Mother?
- Very beautiful, I tell you, really. What a choice!

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.020
- Yeah.
- Is a beautiful sari.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.740
You see, we had gone for that bumper sale, where we got everything very cheap and then Warren had an idea,

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.060
that he should buy something for every center that is beautiful. Alright.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:36.160
[UNCLEAR] now you double it. Yes, now take it around, back [UNCLEAR]

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:44.140
- See, one of you come around here. Take it through
- That's better.
- Put it over, wrap it around

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.780
Make it double. It's beautiful. I tell you, that color is so beautiful.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.600
Really, the most beautiful one you gave it to Auckland.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.100
- Yeah
- [UNCLEAR]
- Can you [UNCLEAR] it Mother?
- [UNCLEAR]

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:06.000
It's really beautiful! It's like a lotus - the color is.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:24.300
This thing is another; Just came as a by-product.[UNCLEAR] It's nice - isn't it?

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:30.460
- This is beautiful; It's beautiful!
- [UNCLEAR]
- We can say it beautiful but also

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:36.380
Mother, we are offering it to You, Shri Mataji - we didn't, we didn't choose it but we're very grateful that his choice

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:43.420
- It's very delicate and nice, really
- Everyone has seen it.
- Seen it - alright. Thank you very much, thank you. May God bless you!

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.900
- You like the design? Isn't it nice? [UNCLEAR - RARE STONE?]
- We just have to buy, Mother, a nice little chain

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:57.180
- That we'll buy; Mother can buy something also [UNCLEAR - THIS TYPE OR THIS TIME?]

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:03.700
May God bless you! It's beautiful, this one is a beautiful sari

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:10.920
It's really beautiful! I wish people also become warm like this.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.640
I think, My eyes were closed when he took one for Me.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.440
You must take the whole - that's the way. That's the best.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:30.640
- Cheryl is a great photographer
- I know she is. Yes, you did some very good ones even.

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:51.560
This little Matthews is another one. I don't know how he gets it so spontaneously - beautiful photographs!

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:58.400
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION BETWEEN YOGIS]

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.580
- [UNCLEAR] this is the one and another one just before this.
- Yes

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:09.300
- Is just, I tell you, so beautiful
- There were three with the, with us

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:17.100
- beautiful
- Thank you.

May God bless you!

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:46.160
- This is a camera or...
- Video, video, Shri Mataji
- I see
-

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:53.080
That shows there wrapped up in the lotus

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.920
Yes

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:09.160
It's very good. Is this the same video or is a different?

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:22.440
It's different - isn't it? It's coming out very well. Very good, very clear. [UNCLEAR - SO?] very clear.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.160
Brian's in  the business - it should be. [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:41.500
First thing about using machinery and nothing about, nothing

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:49.580
Like Me; I'm so bad, I'm very bad at it. See, machinery I just can't think of, really.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:59.880
Just don't know what is machinery is really because.... it's very good, it's coming out very well.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:12.800
- It has to be in an angle all the time?
- No, so You can see it, Mother.
- That's the thing is, yes. It's very good.

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:27.440
It's so nice to be here again. I have to come again once more. I was telling him how we are going to manage that.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:35.380
- You have to get an around the world tour
- You see, it is true. What you said Me that, "People are so conditioned and absolutely

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:43.280
frozen into it," but we shouldn't worry about those people. They are not all - they are very few,

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:50.640
actually, such people are. The people who, they may be at the helm of affairs, they might be the controlling people and all that,

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:57.700
on the whole, I think that, the general public, you see, has that feeling still -

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:04.800
they can be brought around. I told you, fifty percent of Australia, I have a feeling, are seekers -

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.980
- fifty percent are seekers
- Hmm, that's tremendous.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:14.420
but they're lost. I'm not saying that they are all available to Sahaja Yoga but they're lost but they are.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:21.860
- They're like lost sheep - they are to be found.
- We have to start a campaign - that's all. We have to really start a campaign.

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.340
Can start a campaign; You can do it, no doubt.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:33.480
A message came through last night from [UNCLEAR] from Warren, saying that You had said that

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:40.480
campaigning was necessary and that [UNCLEAR] to a certain extent actions today with the press -

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:45.520
normally are very civilized, quite straightforward and they

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:50.040
- [UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]
- [UNCLEAR] indecent
- today I

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:59.080
[UNCLEAR] quite strong about,  "Campaigning, campaigning in there?" so I was [UNCLEAR]

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:06.880
But you have to get after them, the way they are, you see. They are so much used to protests and so much used to very heavy

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:13.140
blasting that they cannot stand, I mean, they cannot understand that there could be mild

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:19.280
people, there are people who are trying to just go out in a very beautiful way

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:27.640
but, I think, if the Truth is not accepted, you have to break many things, you have to break many things

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:34.340
because it will manifest itself by breaking so many things  - you'll better to warn them, better to warn them.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:43.180
Only shackles will be left out of them. If it has to come out it will come out and come out in a very big way and they'll be left

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:51.920
untold. It's better to tell them openly; Better to tell them that this is what it is; Is the Last Judgment, no doubt.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:15:02.620
As it is so many things are happening like, now they are challenging Christ and His Immaculate birth, His

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:07.580
about His miracles - everything is under challenge so what are they talking now?

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:15.300
So they, after some time they'll have to make Mr. Paul as they will come out Pauleen religion.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:28.560
I don't know what's the meaning of Paul in Hebrew or in Roman language.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:34.520
- It's a Roman..
- Maybe, it's the one who's seen the light.

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:42.380
Paul, cannot [UNCLEAR] because it was in his name before that  - see in the light - not has been the light.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:46.960
- He was Soul of Tarsus.
- He was what?
- Soul of Tarsus.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:53.220
- What's that?
- That's his name.
- That's Turkey - Tarsus was Turkey and he was of the Greek

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:59.160
He was a Greek, he was a Jew of the D'Aspro which means [UNCLEAR] of Judiah

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.300
and he was really, what we call Turkey.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:09.520
- He was Turkish?
- You know why, yes, that [UNCLEAR]
- He belonged to Rome.

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:14.540
He belonged to the Roman Empire as a citizen but also was a Greek

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:19.460
because he was part of Turkey which was then owned by the Greek Empire.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:28.760
- He became Paul after his
- Oh, I see
- after the Buddha came,
- Then he became Paul.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:37.880
after he hit his head on a stone, after he fell off a horse, after he top of a donkey, had a [UNCLEAR]

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.820
changed one hallucination for another

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.620
That's how he became Paul.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:55.140
- Paulo is an Italian name.
- Paulo, means what?

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.460
- It's folk.
- Annh?
- Folk, as we call it

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:08.320
So, he called himself an Italian then. First he was Greek, then he became the Turk, then ... I tell you

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:16.780
- He was a Greek Turk who was a Jew and a Roman citizen.
- Luckily the Turks, the Turks are not so traditional people

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:23.780
- why?
- He's not very traditional, Mother.
- but Greeks are. Greeks are traditional, so how can he be Greek?

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:27.160
[UNCLEAR]

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:36.480
Must be something, you see, because what I'm saying, that see this Turk, Turkey might have been captured later on by Greek people

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:45.020
might have, they might have extended but there's no similarity in their faces or in anything but very different people to look at.

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:58.420
- The whole Empire extended there, the cultural in the Greeks there - the education, the language
- Hmm

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:05.800
- It seemed to override
- but Turks do not speak Greek language
- They used to, Mother, they used to.
- Achcha, but not now.

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:14.120
- After this Kemal Pasha they speak some other, it's a
- We had Mahamadim, MahaIslama is the

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:26.660
- Tonight [UNCLEAR]
- Yes, that will be nice
- Why don't you take this?
- Alright. It's a beautiful sari actually - color is so nice

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:43.660
- Wipe My feet, I think, with a towel. This is the towel you can wipe
- [UNCLEAR] you can wash Them also
- No, it's alright.

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:50.740
Just wipe it fully [UNCLEAR] I can do it. Yes, yes, yes - They are very sturdy feet.

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:57.060
- Very sturdy feet
- [UNCLEAR]

00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:03.780
- They have worked very hard. Yesterday specially,  see how that man I put all My feet and all that

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:07.720
Isn't it a beautiful combination?

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:21.560
Thank you. May God bless you!

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:33.720
We were just planning that supposing we go, we take a tour like

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:40.000
come to America and then travel with the Sun, you see,

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:48.260
then come to Auckland, Australia back - will be better; He was saying, "Yes, that way."

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:57.260
"You travel with the Sun - will be better," he was saying. I don't know, this year, I don't know what's going to happen. As it is, 250 people, you know what it was.

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:02.820
- Terrible!
- Tremendous, tremendous!
- You came to Brahmapuri, Veedo? - you were not in them.

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:09.440
Oh, that was the best part - that was the climax and then the second one came when we went to

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:17.220
- Bordi, Bordi marriages. Who was there, one of you, any one of...?
- David. David was our representative, who was there right through.

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:22.460
- Oh, I see.
- He's in England now. He's gone home to England to spend little time with his parents.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:28.360
- and he'll be back here in New Zealand in..
- He sent presents for you, your

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:35.860
- Yes, we received almost beautiful [UNCLEAR]
- he gave you for the Pujas and the things

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.380
- beautiful, beautiful!

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:44.860
- but you know they are so particular about customs and things

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:53.580
the last time that when they came to Australia they brought everything and just walked through

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:58.240
They came like traders, nobody asked them - but you people they don't ask.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:06.620
The, you see, the residents they don't ask much but they thought I was an Indian maybe I'm carrying narcotics or something.

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:16.700
Rather unnerving Shri Mataji that New Zealand should be the one place, the first place where You're

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:21.420
- asked to open Your luggage
- Yes, because one becomes
- the customs people search

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:26.220
but they were really tired, you know, taking out everything, fixing up everything, they were tired.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:33.060
I said, "I'm sorry for the trouble you have to take - really don't know what to [UNCLEAR]

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:43.180
How can they find a narcotic in, in searching a place like that? - they cannot.

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:49.340
I don't know what they were looking out for - just can't understand.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:55.740
- They - I don't know what circumstances are. A diplomatic luggage is never
- Never -

00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:02.440
but what were they looking out for? This is something I can't still understand because the way they saw, you see, here and there

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:10.260
and just pushed their hands here and there - what can you get? if you have to carry narcotics, you have to go into the - isn't it? Under a [UNCLEAR] they should see.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:22.840
- No answer.
- I just don't know what were they looking for.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:41.500
See, the story about this is that, they wanted Me to buy a mangalsutra, you see,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.220
so we went - they're very expensive; This one is about fourteen thousand rupees, you see.

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:56.160
so I said, "May get, may not get, I don't know," but they had a little small thing in that amount and that too silver and this. I said,

00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:02.460
"Why do you want to waste all this money I have already got one thing with the diamonds, so let's buy something else, you see."

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:08.560
then suddenly I turned around that shop - all kind of junk was selling.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:15.260
So, suddenly I turned around and what I see, this little piece this form

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:22.640
and next to that was another one, which is another very beautiful thing, which you will be surprised to see that

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:30.140
it is made of the same, what you call that - coral - red coral;

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:36.700
I was very amazed, I said, "This is here," - I had never seen anything made like this in India, so brought it

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:44.420
and that one and this one and a mangalsutra - three put together is the price of that - that one little thing that

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:51.120
and such a beautiful piece it - Warren - is he there?

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.420
It's a kitchen, is it? It's a huge place.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:01.020
Kitchen is very big; Is that the kitchen?

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:09.160
- Kitchen is  very big.
- Sorry, Mother?
- Kitchen is  very big. Is it a kitchen or a dining-room?
- Sort of very well planned and nice

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:13.500
- Very nice! Now I was saying show them the coral thing you got from there
- Yes

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:21.200
I'm telling them the story of mangalsutra - everything in coral; this is coral, that one in coral - just imagine!

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.560
- And this was all in the same place?
- Same place and that too was a Sunday, all the shops were closed

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:36.220
only we had to go to Dadar to this shop and there we find this, you see, Sahaja - it is so Sahaja you can't imagine; We just can't believe it.

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:43.540
And he was worrying, "Mother, it's Sunday, how will we.." We said, "Alright, I'll arrive at that point - let's see."

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:49.400
And there these things we got for the same price that we'd just have bought one mangalsutra.

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:55.160
One better than the other - it's miracles after miracles

00:24:55.380 --> 00:25:00.720
[UNCLEAR]  the art, you see. This is the mangalsutra see now, see, very nice with the coral.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:05.640
- This is the mangalsutra which we bought
- [UNCLEAR]
- [UNCLEAR] in gold

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:11.660
- It's nice we bought yours
- Yes, yes
- Just let them see.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:19.720
[UNCLEAR] all the deities are very helpful to you, that's what I can say.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:26.700
It's very different from others - done well.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:41.200
- This is another
- [UNCLEAR]
- Oh!

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:45.180
- Just look at that!
- This is. - this goes with the mangalsutra.
-

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.480
Just look at that - in the same price - can you believe it?

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:55.380
- Did You tell her, Mother, about we found a little mangalsutra like the one You're wearing
- Yes, yes
- quite as good as the one as She has

00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:02.400
Yes a very small, very small, much smaller  than this and that too a silver thing and all that in, so

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:10.580
- we were not very happy with it - just see that. It's a piece of art and they said that, "It's been with us for many days, many years

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:17.580
and this we cannot make, we cannot make again, we cannot repeat it even if You want us to, we cannot repeat it."

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:27.560
- [UNCLEAR] color of great gold.
- This is 22 carat gold again - real gold

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:36.600
- Now this is another story
- This is all part of it the

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:41.200
- [UNCLEAR]
- of one piece - out of the one piece we got three pieces.

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:49.280
It is, it is most auspicious that this should be a combination of gifts because both Australia and New Zealand

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:55.580
- are part of the same energy in the Universal sense
- That's what I'm saying - it is so.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.900
and also of coral means it's Ganesha's.

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:05.640
the coral to find, see, in the shop there were no corals, nothing, suddenly, these three pieces came up.

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:20.060
- [UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]
- That's all, it's good. What's that?
- That's some ginger [UNCLEAR - COOKIE?]

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:25.120
Something sugary if you have [UNCLEAR] If you have any

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:30.760
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:43.020
- So well done!
- This is the
- This is another miracle.
- This is the gift that we're all getting from [UNCLEAR]

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.620
- This is another miracle also, just see that
- For Haiwatha

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:59.000
- Silver pearl - queen of the Universe. Like [UNCLEAR]
- Warren has a special gift, I must say.

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:09.560
And I'm telling him, "Don't buy. Now, three you have bought, now don't buy this, I'm feeling shy." "This is but for birthday, Mother," I said, "Forget it."

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:16.680
Isn't it, [UNCLEAR] in the same amount - can you imagine - a little thing like that - even a smaller than that

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:23.420
- than what She's wearing
- what I'm wearing
- about three
- much smaller - all these three things came in that amount.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:29.980
It was a coral day, I tell you.

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:46.580
- So much beautiful!
- Isn't it? See the workmanship. This is very beautiful, this one and every piece is different.

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:51.720
- Just let the camera have a look at it.
- Add the other pieces.
- Let [UNCLEAR]

00:28:55.040 --> 00:29:02.040
And they said, "We can't make it for You any other. This is the only one we have. We cannot make it."

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:11.220
- See this one - see the workmanship
- The [UNCLEAR]

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:18.960
- Yeah
- It's just beautiful [UNCLEAR] ! Snuggle little look

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:23.980
-  Warren is very good.
- Bring it [UNCLEAR] put it in front of the camera - just let it see.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:28.720
- He's luckier than Me; If I want to buy, I cannot get things.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:36.900
- Turn around.
- I think this is made here - isn't it?
- Yeah

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:42.660
- Made from Australia, made here
- Made in New Zealand. Haan, just see how did I know.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:50.540
- It is, it is actually painted by a relation of [NAME UNCLEAR] specially for You.
- haan, I see - beautiful!

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:57.600
- Very good paint
- Her realization last year
- these daisies are there - three daisies. It's very beautiful!

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:06.640
They don't make things like that, normally but in Australia, I found [UNCLEAR] like that

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:13.420
- Who made those - now the ones you gave Me?
- Cups, Mother?
- Not cups, the plates.

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:20.460
- Oh, Joe
- Joe
- Joe Robin Reeds, Mother
- We have two [UNCLEAR] and two pujas as well

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:25.960
- Oh, is it [UNCLEAR]
- [UNCLEAR]
- That's awesome!

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:29.580
- She's very generous too.
- She's so generous

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:37.320
- Did you each of these pieces costs of, each of these pieces costs - lot of money is
- It's pure gold
- Pure gold?

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:45.560
- and She gives them by the dozen
- What is a beauty it is!

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:51.020
She's given Me one like this. Yes, I have one. It's beautiful, isn't it?

00:30:55.740 --> 00:31:00.360
It's beautiful! Beautiful, really beautiful.

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:03.860
It's very hard to get that red in [UNCLEAR] too.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:15.940
This they will appreciate much more, anywhere, not the variety so much - it's beautiful!

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:21.220
- Let us keep it for Puja - beautiful!
- Nice [UNCLEAR]

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:25.520
and this also one other, one other for gift

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:31.960
- which can grow, which is this
- but

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:38.980
be careful.

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:52.300
- He's [UNCLEAR] all about a potter. He's a sahajayogi in Perth, in sense.
- In Perth?

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:56.360
- In Perth
- It's beautiful
- and

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:07.360
Very good, very good. This is  very good. Even you see the different

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:14.200
things are there like the light that's small - not really it shows

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:26.560
Very well done! It is very lively because the light falls on that, you see,

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:32.780
so it looks very lively. It's beautiful!

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:41.220
- It's a lovely gift when it arrived.
- It was a sheet, sheet of [UNCLEAR] photographs, isn't it Sheryll?

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:44.440
- Sure, yes.
- See, what they are.

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:49.920
- She never saw the light herself, did she?
- No.
- No
-

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:59.980
How she took seven of them, it's very surprising - one after - it is guided, I think

00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:04.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:12.420
It's very well done - beautiful! It's real gold.

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:24.020
- It's color of pearls
- And [UNCLEAR] and it's very, very delicate;

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:27.740
See, it's so delicate, it's very delicate thing.

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:32.020
- There is [UNCLEAR] gold, Shri Mataji
- Annh?
- There is [UNCLEAR] gold
- Gold?

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:40.080
- [UNCLEAR] gold.
- No, it's real gold. Is 22 carat - it's real gold
- Ah, I see.
- 22 carat.

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:48.500
Not gold plated - it's all gold - yes.

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:55.980
So very cheap, you just can't believe it! How did you like this piece?

00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:04.620
It's very good work, hain? This was in Jaipur he picked up. He, you see, he's very lucky, I must say - he's very lucky.

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:13.660
You knew about the saris we went to buy for the Puja - went to the shop and they had it in the bundle.

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:21.380
We asked them, "Have you got any pure zari saris?" "Yes," and eleven of them in a bundle - can you imagine?

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:26.960
I don't know, I could not protest even the way it was done. You see, they took it out

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:33.220
and each sari could cost about six, seven thousand rupees - worth for 1600, so I kept quiet.

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:40.780
I said, "What to do now, what can you say?" Being too much, really; The graciousness is so great.

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:45.060
Beautiful these things are!

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:54.880
Now, lots of new photographs have also come with lights and things.

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:59.660
- This is from, from India?
- Yes, this is bought in India.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.480
- [UNCLEAR]
- Which one? No, no, I don't know - from all over, from all over.

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:13.800
See the other way, the other side. I'll tell you what - never even touched it and saw it.

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:19.580
The beauty of this work is that, you don't get these things normally, you see.

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:25.960
You see the work is on the other side, you see.

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:38.660
- So well finished, you know!
- [UNCLEAR] The back has...

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:42.140
-Yes, the back is done with [UNCLEAR]

00:35:55.160 --> 00:36:02.440
A little bit. I didn't take My [UNCLEAR] there but I did have something on the people had brought for Me.

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:15.380
- Bring the table around. It should be..
- Warren, you know who made this? Did you

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:20.060
- No, I don't know
- It's some thing different, isn't it? Is made by a sahaja yogini.

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:23.500
- Really?
- Hmm. [UNCLEAR]

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:33.080
- It's very beautiful [UNCLEAR], Mother.
- I could see that. I just said, "It is not made in -

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:36.740
it's made somewhere here or in..

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:53.420

[POOR AUDIO - VIDEO QUALITY]

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:46.860
I didn't want to buy, I didn't want to buy a particular thing but I told [UNCLEAR]

00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:12.320
then we suddenly, as usual said [UNCLEAR] and they made very beautiful

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:18.240
plated fifty percent [UNCLEAR]

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:31.120
and bought such beautiful tea-set and very [UNCLEAR]

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:36.180
[UNCLEAR AUDIO]

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:42.000
- We spent a lot of time as well looking for it.
- To no avail
- To no avail

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:49.200
and we went, this time, to see one, in Adelaide again, one exhibition just to see what they're making - absolutely primitive stuff.

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:59.760
Surprised - absolutely primitive; Even the dresses were made, as if, you would look like a cave-man or something

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:04.780
[UNCLEAR] girl selling cave-girl dresses [UNCLEAR] leather hanging on

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.780
with a leather, you see - have you seen that sort of a thing - looking so funny.

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:16.880
One lady traveled with us with that kind of a funny dress. Now-a-days, you see, they make this another style, this another style

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:21.360
Only they can do something with their hair, I think, they can't do anything else - so.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:45.780
- New Zealand is famous for potters
- Which one?
- Number of

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:53.400
of potters in this country doing quite enterprising work, quite rather primitive ones slab one

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:59.720
[UNCLEAR] making slabs but there's also another potters doing very delicate work

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:05.240
- Is it?
- Yes, there's one doing

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:11.540
quite creative channel birthday by our

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:20.080
by a potter we have hopes of becoming a sahaja yogi some right [UNCLEAR] since

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:28.540
- Oh, that's fine. Wow, it's Kundalini
- Really?
- Oh, it's done well.

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:34.280
That's something, really - it's quite delicate and deep.

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:40.640
- It's beautiful! Just see Warren.
- Yes. Subtle colors
- very good.

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:48.020
- Like more tea?
- No, thank you, no, thank you. It's alright. So, that's how it is.

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:04.380
- Who is this one? What's the name of the potter?
- Hainesly, Hainesly Niceon

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:12.840
There're a number of, a number of potters who're working in fine work

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:16.900
It should be, it should be, it should be like that.

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:27.020
- We got one gift of fan
- Hmm
- and that had a Ganesh [UNCLEAR]
- Really?

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:33.380
Very free flying but very welcome, very beautiful - similar to this in color.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.040
But who's seeing all this in the Unconscious?

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:44.640
[NAME UNCLEAR] She's, she's selling her work now in England and

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:51.240
and what she sells here for 15 and 16 $, sell for 60 and 70

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:54.680
- in, in
- Really? In England?
- hmm

00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:01.620
- She can sell as much as she can make.
- Hmm

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:16.980
That everything they are scientifically said, "[UNCLEAR] should be [UNCLEAR] should be [UNCLEAR]."

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:21.980
It is so spontaneous that you cannot write it down exactly.

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:28.580
The color should be such, what is good what is bad. You see, the ideas,

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:37.340
which come to you after seeing something, should not be conditioned by somebody else.

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:48.500
Even you cannot appreciate spontaneous art because you're already conditioned - you see through that hole.

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:53.900
- Same with music as well
- With music very much.

00:42:54.200 --> 00:43:01.220
- Heard somebody, the other day say that, "Within twenty years,  just to open store, would be just too expensive."

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:06.520
and therefore music will uphold a name by electronic means and so on

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:10.960
and they can, even now, make music electronically which

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:15.560
- Warren, why don't you try - it's very good. Try one.

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:21.220
We're just realizing that we're two hours ahead and wondering why we're not terribly hungry

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:24.620
- It's actually only six 0'clock out
- Hmm

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:30.220
- So, we'll have dinner at ten, something like that, Mother - is it alright? It's 8:15 now.
- Alright

00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:40.940
- Or nine? When would You like?
- Whatever time, I mean, I'm alright with you to have. Warren should be alright.

00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:46.860
- Alright, would you like to introduce everybody to Shri Mataji?
- Alright.

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:52.100
- [UNCLEAR - SWATI?]
- Just let them be wherever they have be

00:43:54.800 --> 00:44:01.820
- [UNCLEAR - VINAY?] of course You know?
- Of course, I know. I know her. She's doing very well.

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:06.740
- She's growing very well.
- This is [NAME UNCLEAR]

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:14.320
- When did she get her realization?
- Two years ago or four

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:18.280
- Three years
- Three years ago. She came across to Australia

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:23.320
- I remember meeting her.
- and was there for our [UNCLEAR] and

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:31.400
- started develop her realization there, then came back to New Zealand
- You came from New Zealand to Australia first?

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:40.040
- So, you are a New Zelander.
- Yes. Cheryll's sister - this Cheryll
- [UNCLEAR] your sister, o, oh.

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:45.620
They have a mother - different paths.

00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:55.040
- Keep a little back
- Aitrow is quite new, in fact. She got her realization earlier this year

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:58.600
I see, she's good, she's very good.

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:05.320
- and within a matter of a week or two, she moved into the [UNCLEAR]
- Really?

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:12.600
- so she's starting to, starting to settle into sahaja.
- You are a New Zealander too.
- Yes.

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:16.260
- All your life you've lived here?
- Yes.
- Hmm, good.

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:24.300
That's it. We should get New Zealanders  - is the main point because they are the essences which will then work out. Hmm.

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:33.740
- So, what do you think of your age group people - are they open to sahaja yoga, will they be open?
- [UNCLEAR] they are, Mother, they are - my age group.

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:40.880
I have a feeling that this age group is very different. They are born with  more vision, more compassion

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:46.200
more understanding of a wider world but earlier, naturally, you see, the effects of these

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:51.000
people, who came here, were called as Paki haq, as you said -

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:56.920
so they, they had come with other intentions - they couldn't assimilate much of the thing

00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:02.120
Such a beautiful place - one should have a feeling.

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:09.040
- Hmm, then?
- [UNCLEAR] this is Wein, who's been

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:15.080
- Wein?
- Wein, who's been coming quite, quite regularly

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:19.140
[UNCLEAR] is good, very [UNCLEAR]

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:23.220
- Wein works in electronics
- Is he?

00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:26.900
- So, he's somebody who will help into
- organizing

00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:32.920
- [UNCLEAR]
- Ours is also Divine electronics - isn't it?

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:38.400
Works the same way - negative, positive.

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:46.120
Jane, as mentioned, is, in fact, an artist. Jane has been to art school, has done

00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:53.320
- quite a deal, has exhibitions herself
- Really?
- and she has just recently finished her course at,

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:59.840
at Teacher's Training College and now is established teacher at High School, just near here.

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:08.200
- Support weight and all that - ah, good!
- so she's teaching also the things like art itself and History about itself.

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:12.120
- Ah, good!
- She has an exhibition, some little time ago,

00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:19.880
- of a [UNCLEAR]. All the pictures were fox [UNCLEAR] pictures of a fox.

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:25.320
They are the most amazing animals also. They can live for days together.

00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:33.600
You know, they have lived for years and ages that's when they are found; For ages they have lived - don't know, no one knows their life.

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:45.260
Aitrow, Aitrow is like [NAME UNCLEAR]. She works in a, in a shop, in a boutique, You know.

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:50.940
- Ah! Designing [UNCLEAR]. Designing or selling?

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:54.260
- Selling.
- Selling.
- Hmm.

00:47:54.460 --> 00:48:01.080
- [UNCLEAR]
- O,o,oh!
- [UNCLEAR] see locket, inside it - locket

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:08.120
- Hunh?
- Inside the locket, Mother.
- Oh, I see and a frog smiling.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:29.680
- Last time, I was telling him about a frog in a well
- Last week
- This was [UNCLEAR] came in my mind

00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:34.900
Frog in a well. You know the story, frog in a well?

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:40.640
- Yes, it's a Chinese story.
- Haan. It's Indian. There was a frog in a well

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:49.160
and one frog jumped out of the well and told that he saw a very big animal.

00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:54.400
So, the frog in a well thought how can there be a bigger animal, bigger than himself because he was such a

00:48:56.180 --> 00:49:01.940
ego-oriented fellow, you see. So, he said, "How big?" So, he said, "Very big," so he started puffing up

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:09.700
himself; He just pushed some air into his body - just again started, you see, blowing inside and, "He's so big?"

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:17.400
He said, "No, no much bigger," "So big?" went on and on and on till he just burst out

00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:23.140
You see, that's the story 'Frog in the Well'

00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:33.040
- This is, this is [NAME UNCLEAR - BRYAS?] Shri Mataji.
- Of course, [UNCLEAR - BRYAS?] I know
- He's also an artist, he was also

00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:38.380
- All artists here?
- Yes a number of
- He's

00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:43.840
- Great artists, annh?
- It's like a Hamsa
- Just see. Alright, put your head down, let's see.

00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:47.060
- That's it.
- hmm

00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:54.920
So, all the artists have must Swadhishthana - right Swadhishthan - that has to happen and one has to work on that.

00:49:56.260 --> 00:50:00.780
Good, he's sucking vibrations. Good! Are you feeling?

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:05.860
- He's got [UNCLEAR]...
- It's tremendous, it's tremendous; They're all Saatvikaas - in the center.

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:14.100
- He's with, he's with us in the house as well.
- Is it?
- In your ashram he is
- Is he? All good.

00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:20.460
- So what do you paint?
- Portraits.
- Portraits, hmm.

00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:28.480
- Is that your profession or do you do another job too?
- I [UNCLEAR]
- That's good

00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:34.580
There are people here who appreciate art here in this country?

00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:41.920
Yes, regularly held exhibitions. A number of exhibition buildings in the city which have regular,

00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:49.860
regularly display exhibitions - painting, photograph, pottery, wood carvings

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:56.220
- and also ordinary interesting things - enamel works and so on.
- Enamel? [UNCLEAR]

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:05.340
But I think, in certain thing India is really - look at this piece that they have made also - this kind

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.200
I don't think, we can do it here. You see, retail working

00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:18.440
Certain things we are still very good and these things can be taught to the artists there in India - that's My idea is.

00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:26.160
and you can teach them some things that; Like, I saw one thing was good, very good was, what you call,

00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:34.060
- etching -
- Etching?
- etching, that I have not seen in India; People don't do that. Also this pottery painting

00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:43.060
Indian art is fantastic but it is not so realistic like, your portraits are realistic and

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:50.820
also other things, other styles are not there - impression is taken all the styles are not very much known to them.

00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:59.400
Is it very sharp difference, isn't it Shri Mataji, between the Indian, Indian painting which it sets out to

00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:07.900
to represent the figure in it's perfect form which seems to be in the paintings [UNCLEAR] of the Deities and so

00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:11.880
- that the job of the painter is not to express himself
- hunn

00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:15.500
- but to be himself talented
- He doesn't even write his name, you know, doesn't even

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:23.560
that's not there. He doesn't want to express himself; He is trying to, I don't know, he's trying to express the Creator

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:31.480
in his things, you see, that's why it's very different and if you see even the paintings, I gave you, these ordinary ones

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:38.720
from Bihar - see every line is done with a

00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:45.480
very dainty, I mean delicate, pen - we cannot rub it off, you see

00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:52.740
every line is drawn, is drawn now - it's not rubbed off and they don't have any other tracing done or anything - just free hand

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:59.160
and imagine, how many lines they do and this - no problem at all, I mean, nothing is destroyed,

00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:03.440
nothing is rubbed off - it's just the same they make at a stretch.

00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:13.660
So one thing is, concentration is good and their deftness and the fingers are very steady, you see, shows their nerves very steady.

00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:20.340
Is they're peaceful people that's why they can do it. And also I saw this miniature painting - I haven't brought any

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:25.600
to show you but I wish I'd brought to show you; Miniature paintings are so delicate, so delicate

00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:29.520
little, little things done so delicately with such artistry.

00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:37.940
I don't know how they do it in the villages - just done for no price at all. What about the present? Better get it.

00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:47.340
- We got a present for them.
- Oh, that one, yes. It's nice and early to give it -  now that's good.

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:53.000
- [UNCLEAR] Adelaide [UNCLEAR]
- Yes, I know but I enquired if you have it or not.

00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:06.600
But for them art is not money, art is not anything else but enjoyment, just enjoyment, so they just indulge into it

00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:12.320
and they make a perfect job. Now see, this sari of Mine is, I must show you

00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:17.840
because I didn't realize it was so [UNCLEAR] it's all woven with hand - see

00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:29.000
See the details that are done - elephant and everything is all woven. What I'm saying, it's all done with hand all woven.

00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:34.820
So simple it is for them to - every bit of it, you see, so delicate;

00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:39.820
This is fine arts, absolutely fine arts.

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:47.440
[UNCLEAR] had a famous [UNCLEAR]

00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:51.000
Yeah, this is Mahakali, Mahalaxmi, Mahasaraswati - They are

00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:59.260
No, it is Shri Krishna, I'm sorry. This is Shri Krishna and these are the gopis dancing - this is what they have shown - see

00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:04.300
- Just hold it up to the camera.
- What's this?

00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:21.840
See now. [UNCLEAR] craft. You just sit down and do it.

00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:31.600
But not one line you'll find is, sort of, wrong or anything is rubbed off - nothing; Just they take the paper, start doing it.

00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:39.860
There they're. The theme and everything is so spontaneous - just like somebody is sitting down and singing to you - it's like that.

00:55:55.180 --> 00:56:01.160
This time I couldn't get any - I was so disappointed. I said, "What's happening to this, why I didn't get anything?" I mean,

00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:09.080
normally I get about 100-200. Last time I got about 150. This time didn't get any; I went to Patna for that purpose.

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:15.820
I hope next time I'll be able to get some. So, that's it.

00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:31.300
You see, he didn't give you the 'raas' - it gave all of them like this, I don't know why. I see them all of them on this there.

00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:38.640
- Just two, Mother, these... these two of this and then two [UNCLEAR]
- You see, the theme is

00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:46.840
that they see Krishna everywhere, you see, standing with everyone and they're wondering what is this. you see, like this the expression is.

00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:51.340
It's just a village craft, absolutely and also His

00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:58.520
- stories about Him how He killed and what He did and
- Always little bit miniature ones.
- Haan, miniature ones - yes.

00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:02.760
See the shades and things they've done.

00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:10.700
- Berry, you've got a big enough wall?
- [UNCLEAR] yes
- There you can put it, yeah.

00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:14.100
You see the fineness of the work!

00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:29.620
- That's from your big brother.
- Ah! It's beautiful
- Such a lot of work, I tell you, such a lot of work.

00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:36.060
and this cloth looks like silk when they have done it.

00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:45.080
All His life stories on the sides they have done.

00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:56.260
God knows what sort of colors they are using - some sort of indigenous colors.

00:57:57.980 --> 00:58:05.440
Is there anything with the - this would be better for - same style; They're all the same style - yeah.

00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:12.700
- There's about little different here and there.
- There's a difference there.
- Hmm.

00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:20.520
- But the Raas is not there.
- There's a little Raas in the photograph. I will show You.

00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:26.620
but that Raas one he didn't give us. Perhaps, you told him we don't want the

00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:35.960
- See it's just there.
- It's giving very inside there, somewhere. If not, it's alright. [UNCLEAR] but one has to be careful.

00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:42.780
- I know it's just the fall
- Yes, there's a difference - see. There's one house here and house there - there's no house there.

00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:50.720
- Only the Raas is there.
- Raas is different style, you see, it's different.
- This is another one. [UNCLEAR]

00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:58.600
- Whichever you like. I think, this is, this would be better for New Zealand.
- Alright. I think, they can get this for [UNCLEAR]

00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:08.180
- And all their details.
- It's nice, annh?
- Beautiful!

00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:13.640
- Like it? It's very beautiful art.
- Whichever one you want is yours.

00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:22.560
And this one is better. I find  that one it's more with the house and all that.

00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:34.440
See there are stories around, are there [UNCLEAR] and the ladies also. Here there are no - there are cows here.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.760
- It's quite interesting too.
- Everything is, no doubt.

00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:56.780
- But there are so many ladies.
- [UNCLEAR] beautiful!
- Can I have My spectacles from there?

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:10.660
- They look national
- What is that national?
- This site, national site

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:16.260
- Is this is the one for New Zealand?
- What is national - where?

01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:22.500
You see it. It is one of the eleven, what we call,

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:28.060
Oh, this one now. When are they going to give back one, alright?

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:32.440
Now, you've already got this one - it's too much.

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:39.440
- This is [UNCLEAR]
- Yeah, national work. So, there was no need for you to buy

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:46.920
He bought it for Australia; This is out of the blue. This is out of the blue.

01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:55.200
[UNCLEAR] work and kept in a pyjama - that's the best part of it.

01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:03.580
What a nice one it is - beautiful! But this you get next year - now not this year.

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:08.860
- Hmm?
- This will be next year now.
- Can I have a glimpse at it, Mother?
- Alright, let them have.

01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:18.280
you have no puja here - are we going to have any puja as such? Then you can

01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:26.720
You see, every nationality has to have one sari, so like that they have given eleven saris; It's a very beautiful piece, no doubt.

01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:31.840
May God bless you! Just see that - see the workmanship.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:40.820
So, he included you, you see, in buying that, this is his he included you in one of the centers.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:49.020
- This is your program sari, I've called it.
- huh
- This is your country sari
- National, yes, national sari because you are a nation - isn't it?

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:53.880
- Isn't it? See the workmanship.
- This is a gift from me, alright,
- Alright.

01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:59.140
To you people but this is the one you bought for the birthday.

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:06.080
[UNCLEAR] When you bought this national, why have one more?

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:14.520
- So, this is the one we keep for when we have a puja?
- Yes
- It's a beauty [UNCLEAR]
- Are you having a puja here?

01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:19.920
- I haven't planned Mother, I haven't planned, Mother, at all
- Better have a puja there, if possible.

01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:26.060
- They have a little one today.
- That's all? You keep it for next year, alright?

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:31.200
- When you've got a hundred sahaja yogis
- [UNCLEAR]
- Keep it for next year.

01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:39.020
This is a very nice one. This is another miracle - tell them about it.

01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:45.740
- This is a London - we got, we found this in London.
- Can you imagine, for half the price?

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:53.820
Now You know why, Mother, I decided they have an extra twelfth sari for Australia because there has to be one for New Zealand.

01:02:55.420 --> 01:03:01.640
- You had to? I didn't follow still.
- You know that lovely green one that we bought for You first day

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:05.860
- Yes
- I was looking for an excuse to get one more sari
- hunh

01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:13.400
- and New Zealand didn't have a national sari, so they had to
- I see, so next year when they have the puja we'll have it - alright?

01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:16.860
for New Zealand, so keep it then with you.

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:27.820
- Keep it nicely wrapped up
- Warren has his ideas
- That's [UNCLEAR] trousers

01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:34.240
[LAUGHTER] He loves to [UNCLEAR] with the dhobi - so he wrapped up

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:43.200
- I was, I don't know whether it was [UNCLEAR]
- I don't know what's the thing in bottle stuff, you see.

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:51.100
Brandy [LAUGHTER] I'm not guilty.

01:03:53.580 --> 01:04:00.220
- It's a very beautiful thing. You turn around and see the workmanship on the other side.
- Have a look at the palla.
- The palla is so beautiful.

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:06.440
So that you see the proper text and put it in relation to the other part.

01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:15.280
- It's all hand woven and that is pure gold, gold thread.
- How much did you pay for it - 700

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:18.960
- Fifty-one pounds
- Fifty-one pounds - can you imagine?

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:25.160
- That's now fifty one dollars
- Everything - no, no everything inclusive, all, everything inclusive.

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:31.760
Everything inclusive - even the sari and petticoat, everything. Can you imagine?

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:43.660
See the workmanship; This is what I am saying. This, what you have to learn when you come to India.

01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:49.660
Isn't it - that's a something, that weaving that you don't do here - you can't.

01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:56.120
And a little lace like that also will really change the whole pattern, like

01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:02.020
your black, this thing, dress, if you can put a little bit of gold in that, will look nice - isn't it, something..

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:13.220
But we are, we are, you see, like you people only make koala bear, you also make only elephants, you see, like that.

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:18.500
In India, whatever you may try, they'll have elephants, elephants, elephants

01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:24.300
and this also patterns, whatever are there, they do not change, they keep the same.

01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:30.160
If you tell them, why not just make borders, just make cloth without borders - they cannot.

01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:34.980
It's a very, you see, blinkers there are.

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:49.360
- Nice.
- This is some with this hand painting. They stretch it on a stretcher with a back in

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:57.660
and put it plus gold frame and all, super plain gold frame and all that's nice; We've seen them stretch

01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:05.400
You see, they have done one thing good is to put something, a very transparent plastic thing on top, you see, so it doesn't get spoilt.

01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:10.740
- You didn't see that?
- Where was that, Mother?
- It was in Perth.

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:19.000
- Oh, really?
- Hmm. I asked them how is it kept so well
- You mean, spray or a sheet?
- No, a sheet. Absolutely a very, very thin sheet, you see

01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:23.640
- Tied [UNCLEAR] it?
- No, no, no, no - just on the cloth
- Just on top
- Yes.

01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:32.900
Just like when you are framing this, with that they frame that, so it keeps very... because this is after all cloth, you see, it catches some dirt

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:40.720
- but here there's no question.
- There is also a spray you can use on the now, Mother, which has the same effect

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:47.560
- It repels all the dust and it protects the actual fabric.
- [UNCLEAR] saw it there - that will protect the cloth also.

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:55.520
Shri Mataji, would You like to just quietly spend some time?

01:06:55.700 --> 01:07:00.960
- Oh, I
- Just introduce the other people, Brian  and before dinner Mother would just be at ease.

01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:06.960
- Peter You know from
- You know Peter, Mother?
- Of course.

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:17.460
- Since how long has he been with you?
- Not sure.
- Since last few days
- Last few days.

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:24.620
Australians have wonderful vibrations, I tell you - New Zealand and Australians also - Tremendous!

01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:31.500
You can't find this with Americans; They think no end of themselves though. May God bless you!

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:40.520
- It's very good.
- Elizabeth is
- Peter's the one who has the health food chocolates, Sydney

01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:47.900
- Oh
- and has certain propositions for sahaja yoga on those lines.
- Achcha, good.

01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:55.980
- This is Elizabeth, Mother, who's been coming for the last few weeks.
- How are you Elizabeth - let's see?

01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:03.340
Good, good! May God bless you! It's good

01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:09.320
- and [UNCLEAR] Robert
- Hello!
- Now
- Unnh

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:15.600
- Like me substantial
- Is he Greek?
-
-

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:21.560
Good!

01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:26.980
[UNCLEAR] good, excellent!

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:32.800
- Are you Greek?
- No, no Irish.
- Irish, I see.

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:41.400
- Looks like a Greek.
- [UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]
- Annh?
- [UNCLEAR].

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:46.160
- Thank you.
- But
- Irish could be Greek, you see, possibly because

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:50.120
so many Greeks spread that way - Irish, I mean, it's not pure Irish.

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:58.900
- But that Robert and Elizabeth have been involved with Mahikari.
- Beg your pardon?
- But Robert and Elizabeth have been involved with Mahikari.

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:03.560
Haan, that's another problem.

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:12.640
But it has happened with everyone, I tell you. All those who have been even incarnations.

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:19.200
Think of Christ - I mean, you cannot say Christ was not true but his disciples are like this.

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:27.020
See, all those great people, who came on this earth, when their disciples came in, they were like that, so you can't blame anyone.

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:33.960
- Actually, it was the daughter of this
- Huh, she
- she interrupted. He, he was a realized soul.
- He was realized

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:40.640
- But also he was just realized, he was just realized.
- Sukyo Nisama was a realized soul

01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:47.660
but [UNCLEAR], his daughter was absolutely not a realized soul and she was manipulated by the money-makers and the organisation.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:54.080
That's very common, I tell you, very, very common that a person who's of a

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:59.600
very great value comes on this earth, does nice good work and then suddenly,

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:03.260
son or maybe the disciple, they spoil it.

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:11.680
Maybe You're saying that of the year of the originator of the Church in Houston, what You're talking about

01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:17.760
- I said that
- He went to church there - he was a realized soul but think his followers

01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:24.820
- Oh, no not, no, no
- Not [UNCLEAR] the one who started the church
- The one who started the church
- Yes, he was

01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:30.920
but this Sid is, you see is, I don't know what he's doing, I mean, they've compromised

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:38.420
Yes, you see, they want to adjust themselves to unity, unity as funny people.

01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:46.440
They were supporting Rajneesh - now they don't know what to do with him because they were supporting Rajneesh - now Rajneesh has been found out to be a crook

01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:53.540
All the Rajneesh people have now gathered near him there and they were forced to come there

01:10:53.780 --> 01:11:01.160
and it was said that, "You all come along and then, now the whole world is going to end up, so we'll all look after," stupid people went there

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:07.160
They sold all their things, assets and all that and everything was given there in Rajneesh's ashram

01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:12.580
and some of them were paid also money for these people to go there those who didn't have money

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:16.900
but now they are working there like hard labor for them -

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:21.400
they're doing all their farming, this, that and even if they want to come out, they cannot.

01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:28.080
So, they informed the government and then these people have got now guns and everything and

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:34.200
they said that, "Anybody tries to come inside, then we'll shoot off these people," so they are in a mess there.

01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:43.280
Eric is a seeker from way back, Shri Mataji. He's been through

01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:48.700
a lot of the powers on the ways - this Eric.

01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:58.380
Hmm, that why the void is, left side - it's very simple. You can cure it.

01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:06.320
I mean, if you are a seeker, you just go out from everything that is being done - forget it, it's finished.

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:12.940
Because, you see, they appear to be very sensible sometimes, I don't know what they appear to be

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:20.740
but in America, you know, they asked Me, "How many Rolls Royces She has?" Stupid people.

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:24.320
And when they told them, She doesn't take any money, how will She have Rolls Royces?

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:29.840
- So they said, "We're not interested in the person who has no Rolls Royces, who doesn't make money."
- That was the Press.

01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:35.700
- And even a person who came to see Me in London, what was his name?
- Oh yes, the B.B.C. man.
- Haan, B.B.C. man

01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:42.260
He said, "How can it be that You don't take any money then, you see, the Anglo- Saxon brain cannot understand it."

01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:49.520
- Anglo- Saxon brain is which, made of what?
- [LAUGHTER]
- It's the first question I asked here by the Press.

01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:54.160
"How much do you pay, how much do you pay?" First question, first, first question.

01:12:54.320 --> 01:13:02.180
- Meaning that they should pay?
- No, no meaning that they want to know the price that this lady, who I am trying to

01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:06.800
interest them in, how much she charges us

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:12.140
- What are the damages?
- Yeah [LAUGHTER] that's always the first question, always.

01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:16.340
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:23.040
- Peter is, Shri Mataji, Peter is in broadcasting as well. He's a
- Is he?

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:29.300
- He's a Assistant Director
- Oh I see [UNCLEAR] broadcasting [UNCLEAR]
- Yes
- Good

01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:37.660
- They're talking of BBC and here it is
- He has asthma.
- Hmm

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:47.520
That we'll cure. Hold your breath thrice - for a while, for a while - not for long.

01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:57.060
Thrice. [UNCLEAR] there

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:05.640
May God bless you!

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:14.860
They cannot understand some body who could be just [UNCLEAR] can't understand, can't.

01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:22.820
Here I'm fighting this fellow, "Don't buy this I'm feeling shy, then I'll have to make amends, I'll have to buy things to give them presents -

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:28.300
don't buy." They can't understand such a person - that's the trouble is.

01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:38.380
They just can't understand - beyond them. I don't know how they understand Christ.

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:44.400
- [UNCLEAR]
- They don't.

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:49.200
- What do they say about His
- I mean, they've all missed the point - haven't they?

01:14:54.360 --> 01:15:00.680
Such [UNCLEAR] like this fellow, your

01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:05.540
Archbishop of Canterbury - did I tell you about Him?

01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:11.820
He was asked by Robin Day, you see, Robin Day you know what Robin Day is. My granddaughter says,

01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:18.520
"He must have been a bull dog in his last life, you see." This Robin Day asking him a question

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:25.980
- A very aggressive English individual.
- I know - very bluntly asking a question, "Ah! Then what do you think of Holy Ghost?"

01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:32.860
So Archbishop says, "I'm agnostic." He said, "Then what are you doing here?" Said, "I'm doing my job."

01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:39.740
Said, "Yes, yes. You're doing your job, I'm doing my job." [LAUGHTER] Finished. Mutual understanding.

01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:47.660
Probably, they were right because you're doing your job, I'm doing my job - paid for it - finished. "Yeah, I'm agnostic."

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:55.820
I, you know My eyes popped off - C P was there - he took out his spectacles, he couldn't understand - then he put it.

01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:00.480
He said, "Archbishop?" I said, "Yes, this is the one." [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:07.480
- This is [UNCLEAR] Shri Mataji. [UNCLEAR] who acts in the same shop as [UNCLEAR]
- Hun huh

01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:15.460
and had many a comforts inside in the dressing room doing spare time about what sahaja is all about.

01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:22.240
- All those, that I work with, had their realization and they're all coming along to the program.
- Good.

01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:26.940
Yes. May God bless you!

01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:35.160
- You make cotton dresses here, you sell?
- It's all cotton, no polyester.
- No polyester - that's good.

01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:40.120
- Good
- You see, I was telling him that, "You must be getting some cotton here after all."

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:46.920
So he said - then somebody told Me, "They make cotton here in Australia."

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:51.520
Australian cotton you have.

01:16:53.440 --> 01:17:00.400
Because no use having polyester. If not cotton, have silk but polyester is no good.

01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:07.440
Outside clothes may be that some of you have sweaters and things

01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:14.700
but I just can't, I mean, I can't wear it. I get funny feeling inside here.

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:24.580
But how will people manage because they are used to these things and so many clothes, you see, one lady wants to have;

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:30.100
So many clothes then how can she have cotton? Cotton must be expensive here.

01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:38.180
[UNCLEAR] polyester [UNCLEAR]

01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:45.200
[UNCLEAR] all these ladies come in and love, You know, [UNCLEAR]

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:52.360
- This summer has been a lot of cotton, a lot of cotton ball.
- Is it?
- Pure cotton - a lot of

01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:57.100
Truly think is that it is the best expensive and the plastics are the least expensive.

01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:03.740
But in India the other way round. You see, polyester is, at least, four times more expensive than cotton, you see.

01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:12.540
- Silk is half the price of polyester. You know that, Warren?
 - Five times more expensive than stainless steel.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:19.560
Yeah, but now stainless steel, I must say, stainless steel is now very cheap in India but very expensive in Australia.

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:25.820
- We went to the shop, I must tell you this one. Now that, let's meet all of you, then I'll tell you about it.
- Cha Cha

01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:34.560
- She must have been coming at the last [UNCLEAR]
- Put your hands under My feet - alright?

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:38.140
They are all very good, I must say.

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:47.700
- Excellent!
- He's a hard working seeker.
- Annh?
- A hard working seeker.

01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:56.940
- May God bless you! Alright?
- I think, that's everybody.

01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:05.880
- Oh, who's she?
- Come I'll [UNCLEAR] That's Ericsson. That's everybody - should be.

01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:15.120
- So we..
- You may have a rest.
- What's that? Now be done. Everything you've given me
- Just another little present, another little one.

01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:22.580
- It's particularly about New Zealand. It's some pictures of New Zealand, really.
- Hmm, thank you very much.

01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:30.940
- Thank you very much, thank you. Can I open it?
- Yes. [UNCLEAR]

01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:41.520
- That seems to be [UNCLEAR]
- You see, this I knew - Sarva Granthi Vibhedini

01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:47.480
[LAUGHTER] Granthi, I know.

01:19:52.600 --> 01:20:00.360
Now .... but the sticking things I don't know.

01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:06.100
- Knots You can do but not sticky things.
- Yes.

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:13.280
[UNCLEAR] this has been packed very well, so.

01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:21.380
- So they kept the flowers back?
- Yes, they have. They said that they have [UNCLEAR]

01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:29.900
- All humbug. They wanted to have the flowers themselves.
- Humbug
- Absolutely.

01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:42.520
[UNCLEAR]

01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:52.920
- New Zeal Land
- Land of new zeal.
- New zeal

01:20:54.980 --> 01:21:00.400
Land of many dreams - but the dreams have to come true.

01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:10.200
This color scheme is nice. I must, you must see - Rommel's book has come out very well; You'll be happy to see his progress.

01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:16.580
- It's in the smaller case - if you can bring My...
- O, You've got a copy here.
- Yes, I have.

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:22.780
- Is it in the top part or bottom part, Mother?
- I think, top part.

01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:34.360
South Island in the country is nearly down in the West coast, which is a very famous tourist area

01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:42.300
It's a field land like in, in Norway - very steep sided mountains going right out very deep

01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:47.860
- I see.
- The sea comes right after the valleys into the

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:51.640
- huh
- under a very tall mountains.

01:21:54.740 --> 01:22:02.540
- [UNCLEAR] my glasses are sitting there just there on ..
- No, it's alright. It's beautiful! See the colors.

01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:06.580
Naturally they are so beautiful.

01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:12.100
This is, this is North of Auckland.

01:22:20.380 --> 01:22:27.840
- There's a lot of bush
- I saw a painting like this on, in the airport.

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:35.880
- swimming - yes
- This is the sort of forest that this wood is grown, Shri Mataji. This is, this is Kauri - one of the, one of the

01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:42.360
- What is it called?
- Kauri - k-a-u-r-i Kauri
- Kauri
- and it's one of the most famous of the New Zealand

01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:49.700
- What is the fruit like?
- I don't know, I don't know what
- Pine cone
- Pine, it's Pine cones

01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:55.360
- Pine - is it Pine? Like the Pine cones
- It's more curled
- Huh huh

01:22:56.120 --> 01:23:02.060
- because we call kauri as something else that's why I wanted to know.
- There's also an Australian tree called a Kauri
-
-

01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:09.840
- which is, but that is, that's quite a different tree
- What are these lines?
- they got the time exposure let the camera run while all the traffic is run through

01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:15.780
- so that these lights have
- [UNCLEAR - ARE ON THE?]
- been printed on the, on the negative.

01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:22.660
- It's like the camera's been opened for ten seconds or fifteen seconds
- So what is this is?
- They're cars

01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:27.540
- they're the lights of cars that are traffic. Here the lights of the car coming forth.

01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:34.940
Because you see in one of My, two of My photographs they've got things like that travelling, going, shooting off like that

01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:41.580
- lights
- That's rather different type of
- That's what I was
- that's a different sort of light

01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:49.760
- That must be with the same kind of a
- That's the Auckland bridge, here.

01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:56.840
I put them it wasn't wide enough. Since I built it, it wasn't big enough, so I built

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:01.840
two sections on either side and the Japanese - they employed Japanese firm

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:08.160
to, to put these extra pieces on the side of the bridge and they called them the nipons flipons.

01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:17.160
- Beautiful!
- This is [UNCLEAR] offices; This is near where we are.
- Hmm

01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:25.180
- This is the [INAUDIBLE]
- This is Chinese style
- Hmm

01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:33.780
- Color schemes are beautiful, beautiful!
- That's the Bay of Islands.That is the most beautiful part of this country

01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:42.840
- lush and lovely!
- Hmm
- This is another famous tourist area - Red Rove, where there are [UNCLEAR]
-

01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:50.440
and bowling mud pools and so on. The volcano, the volcanic is very near to the surface.

01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:58.540
- Hawk water pool it's called
- [UNCLEAR]
- That's also in Red Rove near

01:24:58.940 --> 01:25:05.000
In Japan also you have lots of things like that. Every 28 minutes in a plain city a spout

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:11.980
- of thing comes out - every 28 minutes.
- [UNCLEAR] saying there like they have
-

01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:18.880
- but the timing is so correct - it's beautiful! It's quite old?
- That's Rotoroa again.

01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:26.100
- What style it is?
- Quda. That King had too many wives

01:25:26.820 --> 01:25:33.380
- Here
- That's his style of building. It was from that period but of course it's much more - mop.
- This is the church?

01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:40.400
- No, I say it's a
- It's a residence
- it's a place for people to go to a spa, You know, to
- Hmm

01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:47.740
- take the waters and there's a from a distance of quality to these, to these boiling mud-pools

01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:56.220
- these
- Oh, I see
- people got to take the waters into. Just swim in the hot waters and swim
- See the nature!

01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:05.080
- Tremendous this is!
- All of Rotoroa is like this with every backyard

01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:13.000
- this is little jets of hot steam
- Yeah, where?
- In this town of Rotoroa - in this, right in the center of the island - in the middle of the North Island.

01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:19.280
We're sitting on top of a volcano [UNCLEAR]?

01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:26.820
Like everybody, they say, that when the spurts of steam stop, then you get worried.

01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:33.040
- because as long as the steam is coming up, then probably there's a slighter
- There's an outlet
- it's nothing.

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:39.540
- It's like, I think, this, this looks to Me like Japan, you see,
- What?
- New Zealand same on

01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:46.900
- altitudes
- but it's all, all part of the great circle of geological circle

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:52.420
round the Pacific. It goes up through the Andes, up through the Nawadas, up to the [UNCLEAR - SPOKES?] and so on

01:26:55.320 --> 01:27:02.400
- in California
- [UNCLEAR]
- [UNCLEAR], then right up through Canada through the Elysium Islands, down through Japan,

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:08.180
down through the Philippines, down through New Guinea and round to New Zealand.

01:27:08.420 --> 01:27:14.620
It's all the same geographical red, big geological [UNCLEAR - BANDUNG?] right round the Pacific but

01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:21.160
throughout the tempest of Mother Earth, the heat and the boiling

01:27:21.420 --> 01:27:26.460
and the boiling lava are quite near to the surface - all the way round there - all

01:27:27.060 --> 01:27:33.160
- [UNCLEAR]
- yeah
- This is a colonial hub
- Yes, a number of them

01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:39.880
- Hmm, good.
- [UNCLEAR]
- Well, what's this printed here?

01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:44.060
Umm?

01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:55.480
- Written about [UNCLEAR] in Spain
- [LAUGHTER]
- Are you sure it was something like that?

01:27:55.720 --> 01:28:00.580
Because I've seen the coloring there - Spain or Switzerland - Spain

01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:15.100
That area is called Property Bay. Property Bay because Kelvin Captain Cook arrived here. He couldn't get on-shore to

01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:20.800
- to kill things for food and some -  getting the name Property Bay

01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:27.340
Makes one down with most, who's most propitious for him so called it Bay of Plenty.

01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:35.980
[UNCLEAR]

01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:45.840
- That's a  the mountains and
- All kinds of views and things
- Center of the Island

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:53.460
- The variety is too much.
- It's very much a pastoral land. There's no iron ore in this country at all.

01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:58.220
- No iron ore?
- No iron, so there's no steel. All steel has to be imported.

01:28:58.580 --> 01:29:05.680
- Really?
- So there's no heavy industry
- All, all
- Why don't you import from India we're having surplus? They are having a glut.

01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:14.300
- Steel is in glut there.
- Bring together our Prime Minister with
- Hmm but they won't go to India, I think.

01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:21.280
Well, Australia next door, of course, also has a surplus of, of iron ore

01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:28.960
This is another - this is the next, this is the Capital city of the country - this is Wellington, which is most beautiful city - hub all round.

01:29:29.660 --> 01:29:37.620
- a lovely
- jungle of mountains
- once you get outside that, it's round this beautiful harbor.

01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:42.640
- It's [UNCLEAR]
- It's a capital city like Canberra is.

01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:53.560
They say about it that, "People who were blown into the harbor, never ever would get out of it." It's very windy.

01:29:53.780 --> 01:29:59.760
- Oh, I see. What's this one?
- That's Wellington again.
- This is nice.

01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:06.860
- This part
- This is the old cathedral [UNCLEAR]

01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:20.260
- [UNCLEAR] Mother
- [UNCLEAR] scenes are good. Beautiful

01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:28.680
- There are a number of lakes such are very popular with [UNCLEAR] in the center of the island also.
- Hmm
- [UNCLEAR]

01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:38.000
Just like a reflection it is. This way one reflection, this way another.

01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:44.780
You see, the photographer is good.

01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:55.820
- Very good!
- This is an area where there's skiing.

01:30:56.520 --> 01:31:00.280
Very steep - it's snow there, people

01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:11.000
A lot of, a lot of the literature - this is Christ Church which is a very English city. See, this is it's Cathedral.

01:31:12.620 --> 01:31:19.900
A lot of stories and legends about living in the mountains, living in the rock areas of New Zealand

01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:25.980
mastering straight forth  basic jobs

01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:33.120
occupy quite a lot of literature in New Zealand literature. French chairs of fasios

01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:42.780
- Number of [UNCLEAR] comes up with stones
- Umm?

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:47.740
Comes up with the stones - the wood which is undermined.

01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:56.680
- Hillsides with bush are undermined and the bush falls in the sea and is then washed up
- [UNCLEAR]

01:31:56.920 --> 01:32:04.820
- [UNCLEAR]
- on the shores
- Hmm. They often become fossilized - very, very hard
- [UNCLEAR]

01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:13.180
- There're lovely, lovely waterfalls. I believe the highest waterfall in the world stands in this
- Is it?

01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:17.400
- [UNCLEAR]
- South Island
- South Island falls

01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:25.740
- Same thing
- Highest meaning - longest flow of water.
- Umm?
- The single drop, I think

01:32:26.020 --> 01:32:30.920
- The biggest drop of water
- [UNCLEAR]

01:32:36.580 --> 01:32:42.720
- This is New Zealand's biggest industry - ram and goat.
- Yeah, I know.

01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:49.080
Quite often, one buys shawls in India made from pure New Zealand merino wool.

01:32:49.220 --> 01:32:53.720
- Yeah, yes, yes marina wool, merino wool
- That's an [UNCLEAR - IMPORT?]

01:32:54.660 --> 01:32:59.220
Yes, I bought a suit length, this time of that Merino wool, yeah.

01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:08.180
It's lake Wakatipu which is one of the most famous of the, of the seven lakes. Now it's very much a tourist area so

01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:15.700
- has hotels, motels and distractions and amusements for the visitors.
- Hmm

01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:21.460
- Hunh
- So this being one of them - this is like build this old farm - it's old

01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:26.320
- [UNCLEAR] about gold mine [UNCLEAR]
- Umm

01:33:28.220 --> 01:33:35.240
- What about gold? No more available?
- Still [UNCLEAR] still dig but it's not as it was before.

01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:42.620
- It's not a big industry as it was once before.
- Hmm
- There was a time when New Zealand took a,

01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:48.360
- was part of the International gold chain
- Hmm
- You know, the gold from California to

01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:55.040
- Australia
- Yes, yes
- to New Zealand. This is part of the Central Taigo where's a lot of fruit firm. This is

01:33:55.240 --> 01:34:02.880
- Beautiful! I've got a painting like this.
- They had to, they crossed company so early they had to put a pox of oil

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:07.640
they put pox of oil on the [UNCLEAR - LIGHT THEM?] to keep the frost away from the blossom

01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:13.180
- because the first frosts come after the blossom [UNCLEAR]
- I see

01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:21.680
- and then the light can keep them out?
- Yeah - the heat is just strong enough to keep the frost away from the blossom.

01:34:22.540 --> 01:34:29.380
It is [UNCLEAR]. It's round about what uh.. it's timberish

01:34:30.180 --> 01:34:35.620
It's that the time when in terms like Alexander and so on - is an oily smell in the air

01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:41.540
- but a little bit lighter when the blossom starts to really appear. It's beautiful! [UNCLEAR].
- The picture of the first rain.

01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:49.000
- That's called Sand Fly Bay
- Sand Fly bay?
- Sand fly Bay.

01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:54.960
- This one is?
- Hmm, this area
- Sand fly Bay.
- The Bay of Sand flies

01:34:59.940 --> 01:35:03.180
- Lot of pictures like that [UNCLEAR]
- It looks like Bhairava to Me.

01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:09.580
Yeah, it does - see.

01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:15.400
Lot of those rocks have scone of, what you call, birds

01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:22.380
- Regular [UNCLEAR]
- Is it in the sea - this one? Looks like Bhairava.

01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:27.700
This is Mount Cook, which is again, another a mega spot for tourists

01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:35.620
It's one of the highest places where you can really have a comfortable hotel; Really posh hotel way up a mountain. Of course, it's very expensive.

01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:45.140
- It's called the Southern Alps.
- Let the sahaja yogis go there they'll get it cheaply as we managed it everywhere.

01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:50.720
It's all part of Mount Cook - the area.

01:35:51.060 --> 01:35:58.000
- Shri Mataji, they've made us another pot of tea. Would You like to have one?
- I don't take so much tea [UNCLEAR]

01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:09.380
- Beautiful horses!
- Hmm
- They've grown here. There lots of
- Yes, yes

01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:15.200
- You breed them?
- New Zealand is quite famous for it's race horses. The Australians come across here regularly

01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:22.260
for their yearling sales and a lot of the Australian race horses come from New Zealand.

01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:30.680
So most of the effort in horse-breeding is for racing.

01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:39.880
- Very nice - one better than the other; One can't believe it's so great.
- [UNCLEAR]
- Annh, in such a small little place

01:36:40.700 --> 01:36:47.900
-  all the beauty is [UNCLEAR]
- There's quite a famous commercial for New Zealand which is [UNCLEAR] time

01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:53.640
which says, "The couple in a tourist place, in a tourist shop

01:36:54.040 --> 01:37:01.400
and they say, "All excursion group to Norway and you see shops of fields and so on, now let's go to Spain

01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:07.340
you see some rolling camps, let's go some," and all the places turn out to be New Zealand.

01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:14.520
- because New Zealand has a vast variety of country-side
- You can see so clearly; See such a variety of things.

01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:22.620
- So,
- Thank you very much [UNCLEAR]
- it's like, in Australia, You know, You can travel for 200 miles and the country-side will look very much the same, You know

01:37:22.780 --> 01:37:29.500
- Boring, yeah
- [UNCLEAR] here to come to have
- Yes
- five miles and the whole country-side changes

01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:36.980
Like Yangtze river, every five minutes the rocks change there - everything changes, the

01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:43.780
the trees, the style - everything changes. Five minutes you just go ahead, you'll see something else there

01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:51.980
- So interesting view the Yangtze river - that's the Tao
- Tao
- and I've done that travelling, luckily.

01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:59.060
- Now, this is what Rommel's is, this book is.
- Ah!
- It's called  'Ascent to the Divine'

01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:07.660
and this one here, he's tried to prove that whatever is written in the Puranas and all these things, we have the proof of that

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:14.940
in the [UNCLEAR - NATIVE?] that's what he's tried to say. So, this one he took it there and this is My suggestion

01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:22.960
to put this photograph here. He's gone to Himalayas and he taken Kailash and Mansarovar. Kailash is -

01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:29.060
- See it makes like a four petal thing
- Hmm
- See

01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:40.040
- That's the steps - the structure of the land?
- Yes, how it is - structured

01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:48.920
- and all centered on Kailash?
- Beg your pardon?
- Is that center on Mount Kailash?
- Yes. All, is the center is the Mount Kailash.

01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:55.260
Center is the Mount Kailash where Sadashiva lives, you see, and one side is the Mansarovar, is the Mansa

01:38:55.460 --> 01:39:03.440
- See this one; That's the, that's the emblem they have got for long that this is Kailasha
- [UNCLEAR]
- [UNCLEAR]

01:39:04.540 --> 01:39:07.920
It's all is his scholarship you can see in this what he's done,

01:39:08.260 --> 01:39:13.860
- done it very well but this test you must see.
- That's the most
- This is he's done it with the Kundalini
- Ahh!

01:39:14.060 --> 01:39:21.540
[UNCLEAR] how it is, where is Sadashiva, what is it? All these things - he's done it well

01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:28.800
- Is this a book for publication in the West?
- Yeah
- It's all sold
- Ah!

01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:40.600
Stars I don't know, from where he starts reading. This is it.

01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:48.700
- Beautiful!
- Color blue, you see did it in Switzerland. Painting was done in Switzerland.

01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:54.160
See the women who live here - very innocent.

01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:59.480
It's different there from here - dancing and all that.

01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:05.400
You can see yourself; It's very interesting. [UNCLEAR]

01:40:12.980 --> 01:40:20.600
- What is that name? Man..
- It is Mansarovar - is the one is the Mahata Manasa - is the superego.

01:40:21.020 --> 01:40:26.160
- Ha!
- This is the, you see, Kailasha is the center, then Mansarovar on one side

01:40:26.340 --> 01:40:33.380
and I told him, told him, there must be another, that's there, the lake, which is actually the ego - is the rakshas taal, they call it.

01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:40.320
- Ha!
- And this one is always very peaceful; The other one is turbulent at the slightest move doing it.

01:40:41.180 --> 01:40:45.000
- You can see it.
- You're talking about the two, the two lakes
- Yes

01:40:45.940 --> 01:40:51.720
- and how the weather can be apparently be similar
- Here, the interesting thing, I'll show you, what he's showed it

01:40:52.020 --> 01:40:59.140
you see, the few things that he's brought forth is, the river Ganges, you see, when it comes - see this

01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:06.820
thing that; These are their rituals. He dealt with the public there, what sort of people they are

01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:15.040
and then he dealt with the ... this is how they kill a big

01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:22.940
It's not a bull, it's a male buffalo with all the bhoots in it and all the public sitting there in the night.

01:41:23.220 --> 01:41:30.000
He took the picture in the night. So now, he goes on to this climbing and there he saw there.
-

01:41:30.140 --> 01:41:37.040
Now it's further on - that's about the people. Now, here he's shown Sadashiva, you see

01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:42.700
- and Nandi and this is Mansarovar and this is Sadashiva.
- Ah!
- See this is Kailasha.
- That's Kailasha.

01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:50.220
And if you see Kailasha from there it looks like a human-being with Brahma Vishnu in it - you can see it clearly.

01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:57.580
This is how they went, you see. This is very difficult to go there, so went by that road that is being given.

01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:09.240
- Every, now this is it, see.
- Ah!
- This is Sadashiva and this is Brahma and Vishnu here
- Ah!

01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:17.260
- and this is Mansarovar
- That's, the hills the shape of the, of the Kailash temple at Ellora

01:42:17.420 --> 01:42:24.940
Yes, it's just like that - yes, he's shown that also. [UNCLEAR] This is how they sacrifice goats and things

01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:33.220
in the name of God but he's shown here, see, these things have given the shapes to the temple, you see.

01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:39.980
They have taken from here. He's tried to show this will also look like temples but these are not man-made.

01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:47.940
These are not man-made - at Kailash they are like this, so from there they have taken this idea; He's tried to depict it.

01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:55.780
This is the Rakshas taal. [UNCLEAR] Then, he comes in between with this

01:42:56.460 --> 01:43:03.340
two, three things, you see, like he's shown here how in the villages is depicted like this - the Kailasha.

01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:11.000
Now going up, there's one good thing he's shown - the Swayambhu of - see the color schemes

01:43:11.420 --> 01:43:14.540
- That's like Chinese paintings
- Yes, and see this also

01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:23.320
- is the [UNCLEAR]
- It's like the terrace is going up to the Himalayas
- And this is the Kailash seen from this angle - these people are seeing that, he's showiing.

01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:31.300
Now, this is a kind of a thing that happens sometimes that is a, this is the Devi's,

01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:35.660
uh.. Devi's mountain they say. This is the goddess.

01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:40.320
- Parwati's
- What is the Panna?
- Parwati's

01:43:41.460 --> 01:43:48.720
They've got different, different things and this is the valley of flowers; Is all natural in the jungle, they say - valley [UNCLEAR]

01:43:49.860 --> 01:43:57.160
You see, he's depicted in a way that how you have to go now to river Ganges [UNCLEAR] to river Ganges.

01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:04.120
See, how people are climbing [UNCLEAR]. See now, now this is Amarnath, Amarnath temple.

01:44:04.540 --> 01:44:10.440
See, this is the - this is the lady when she sees Amarnath; His photography is very good.

01:44:11.100 --> 01:44:17.760
Then, this is what they do for the dead. People who are dead, they give them food and this and that - that is what, is a ritual.

01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:25.100
Now, this is where they reach. See the [UNCLEAR]

01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:31.420
this is the place and this. It's so cold, so cold and this fellow is sitting without any clothes there.

01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:36.640
and here it is where the guru Gita was taught to Parwati - this is the place, is here.

01:44:36.860 --> 01:44:41.280
Ah, this is where He says, "I would play the game

01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:45.560
- and I would teach You the things that you have taught Me."
- Yeah, this is it.

01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:52.940
this is the place. Now, this is most wonderful is that, this Ganesha is made automatically, spontaneously.

01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:59.340
for a very short time. It lives for about three or four days. It has tremendous vibrations and that is [UNCLEAR] See how [UNCLEAR]

01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:07.240
- It's ice, is it?
- It's ice. It's - comes down from one little hole there.

01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:11.380
And this is made - only for two three days it stays, this Ganesha.

01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:21.140
And this is the famous Amarnath thing which is made on a particular day is completed.

01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:24.820
That's the Purnima Shivratri - that day it is complete.

01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:33.580
It, then it dissolves again. Then again it starts building up - then again it builds up to Shivratri day.

01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:40.980
Here he has shown, how the Pandavas, when they were in exile, they went and worshiped Shiva instance

01:45:41.220 --> 01:45:45.860
- just a pilgrimage. He's done lot of work, no doubt.

01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:55.800
Then, now he's talking about the River Ganges - how the River Ganges has come and what, how it has come down

01:45:56.460 --> 01:46:03.520
He's taken a very - he's describing here, see, the River Ganges is flowing through this. Same way he will show there

01:46:03.780 --> 01:46:07.500
how it flows down. You see, this is Bhagirath,

01:46:07.740 --> 01:46:12.620
who prayed for Her coming, so he's praying here, in the, in the mythology.

01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:20.180
And this is what seen, so he says this is the churning of the ocean which took place

01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:26.920
and Shiva is sitting there. The two oceans are, part of the oceans are there - one on this side, one on the other side.

01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:33.860
This is Mansarovar and this is the thing with which it was churned; See here they have shown the churning.

01:46:34.220 --> 01:46:40.280
- Ah, yeah.
- See, this is
- This is Krishna
- This is Krishna, of course, Krishna was the one

01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:43.800
who did it but on top of him is, see, this one

01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:51.480
And all this came out of His - Ashwathama, this is Airawat; Fourteen things came out of it.

01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:04.300
Now, this is River Ganges he's tried to show, how the River Ganges comes into the [UNCLEAR - THING?] and

01:47:04.660 --> 01:47:11.440
see this man sitting there and worshiping. Now, it's said, the Airawata, the one

01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:18.820
the elephant that came out, bring out the [UNCLEAR] to pierce here through the

01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:27.080
mountain and this is the piercing point; But I don't know how Rommel has taken this because it is a very precarious point from there the river flows.

01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:40.080
Then, it's the same Ganges river is shown flowing down - this is another one

01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:50.380
This has references that side, then he goes down, how the river came in and how they worship, you see,

01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:58.440
all this is the River Ganges. Just see, the depiction is - mountains are shown this way

01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:06.580
- He's tried to
- It's very, the parts of New Zealand are very, very similar
- Yes, very similar, yes.

01:48:07.240 --> 01:48:13.360
Now see, this is the Banaras - I think, this is Haridwar [UNCLEAR] like this.

01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:20.820
I mean, what he's tried to show, that whatever is described about the river, is absolutely so.

01:48:21.180 --> 01:48:28.160
this you can see the things thereas happening. Also, in the paintings how the river is described

01:48:28.340 --> 01:48:35.360
and this is again the Ganges again flowing; So all this he's described in the book what it is and his theory about it.

01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:42.520
- He's described his theory that is always [UNCLEAR]
- Hmm, lovely book.

01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:49.600
- Shri Mother, would You like tea [UNCLEAR] dinner?

01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:55.660
- What is it?
- Plain or fish?
- Anything, I mean..

01:48:56.300 --> 01:49:02.120
- [UNCLEAR]
- Whatever you have.
- Plain fish
- Would You prefer fish?
- Whatever you have.

01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:07.560
- I mean, fish you have or?
- Fish and lamb.
- Oh, I'll have lamb because I had fish

01:49:10.700 --> 01:49:16.580
- What, have you cooked it or not?
- No, no I'm just going to.
- Better cook fish then fish will be faster, alright.

01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:24.300
- Oh, it is quite
- Is it? Alright, then put lamb - whatever suits you.
- Would You like sour, a little sour
- Yes, I'll have

01:49:24.580 --> 01:49:29.300
- [UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]
- Put it [UNCLEAR]

01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:37.120
Anything is alright, you see, I don't understand much about food. I know how to cook

01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:44.720
But the theory is very great in there, the theory - the way he's worked it out. The book's name is, 'Ascent to the Divine'

01:49:45.380 --> 01:49:48.340
and he's worked out through Kundalini also.

01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:57.280
This is relating everything through the Himalayas to

01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:05.180
progress for the Divine to the nature of Divinity - Kailash has been the center of that particular world

01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:11.300
and with the, with the ego and the superego, these two lakes on either side one...

01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:18.220
There're two lakes. One is called as the Mansarovar is the superego and the another is the ego is the

01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:26.040
called as, what you call that, Rakshas Taal. Rakshas Tall, which gets into turbulence.

01:50:40.380 --> 01:50:47.640
You mentioned in, in India, Shri Mataji, about various woods, asking about what would make [UNCLEAR].

01:50:47.820 --> 01:50:53.920
- huh.
- I collected a few pieces of wood, of New Zealand wood, see here

01:50:55.480 --> 01:51:02.040
- that is, that one is called Toteara
- What is it?
- Toteara

01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:06.780
- To-ta
- Toteara. T-O-T-E-A-R-A Toteara
- Toteara

01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:11.820
It's a very light wood, Toteara, isn't it?

01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:27.840
Beautiful grains, though but very light, I feel. Hmm

01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:35.100
- So, that's Kaori
- hunh?
- That's Kaori
- Kaori, I see.

01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:44.220
- That's what is the most popular wood in New Zealand for.
- But you cannot make furniture out of it
- Yes, furniture is made out of Kaori
- Really!

01:51:45.700 --> 01:51:51.240
- And doors and things
- Yes and plates of various soup -

01:51:51.460 --> 01:51:54.720
- that's an AUM
- Oh, that's beautiful!

01:52:02.540 --> 01:52:06.760
[UNCLEAR] is this but is this a strong wood to [UNCLEAR]?

01:52:07.780 --> 01:52:13.060
It's quite a, yes, it's quite a resilient wood, it's quite a

01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:21.600
- Is it Brazilian?
- No, it's a, it's a resilient wood. It needs a lot of working. It's hard wood to work.
- O, resilient.

01:52:22.620 --> 01:52:29.660
- You have to work very hard with it, is it?
- There's another one which is even more so
- You have to clean it much more, is it?

01:52:30.060 --> 01:52:35.820
- Yes, it has to be, it's, it's, it's
- It's like Rosewood. You have to work hard to get

01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:41.140
- You can't work, you can't go ahead because it breaks off.

01:52:41.500 --> 01:52:48.880
- You have to be careful and [UNCLEAR] continue it
- Breaks up fast
- Hmm, this is a, this is a very, very difficult wood to work.

01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:56.440
- but it's, there's some of it which is even more [UNCLEAR], it's called [UNCLEAR]
- Is it?

01:52:56.640 --> 01:53:00.920
[UNCLEAR] It's a, it has a very rich red flower and

01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:07.020
and it's known as the New Zealand Christmas tree because at Christmas time it comes out of these bright

01:53:07.260 --> 01:53:13.700
- beautiful red flower.
- What greens annh? What a beauty!
- But that's a very, very difficult wood to work
- But it's also oily

01:53:14.100 --> 01:53:20.160
- Would be good wood - this will be good like something nearer Rosewood, not so much but

01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:24.500
- That's, that's Remo
- What's that?
- That's Remo
- Remo

01:53:24.900 --> 01:53:29.980
That's quite a popular wood for making plates and so on [UNCLEAR]

01:53:30.580 --> 01:53:37.380
- But what do they use for furniture here? This would be [UNCLEAR]
- Kaori mostly [UNCLEAR], Remo - yes

01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:41.460
- [UNCLEAR] This would be
- Tables and chairs
- Pine
- Yes the

01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:46.080
- Pine?
- Pine
- Is it strong? Is it?

01:53:47.140 --> 01:53:55.060
- It's very hard wood [UNCLEAR] strong
- In India Pine is no good
- there are a number, there are a number of Pines grown here - different sorts of Pines.

01:53:55.240 --> 01:53:58.920
Some are used for buildings, some are used for

01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:03.600
- furniture making, some are treated, some are specially treated
- What's this one?

01:54:08.100 --> 01:54:12.900
- It's what? Fur
- Fur

01:54:18.780 --> 01:54:26.220
Very nice! This is the wood they have, all kinds - haven't seen one like this before, haven't seen.

01:54:26.420 --> 01:54:31.300
- That's, that's, that's
- What do you call this?
- [UNCLEAR - AHUTAKAWA?]

01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:37.920
- Ahuto
- Ahutakawa
- Kawa
- It's all one word - Ahutakawa
- Ahutakawa

01:54:39.540 --> 01:54:47.240
It's a very distinctive - I mean, at Christmas time, if You looked around here - stood outside and looked around, You'd see the Ahutakawa's in all directions.

01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:53.160
- Is it?
- with these bright red flowers and when they fall, they fall like red needles
- So nice

01:54:53.260 --> 01:54:59.020
- [UNCLEAR - THEMSELVES?] washed or red needles on the pavement
- Like bottle-brush are they? Like bottle brush?

01:54:59.300 --> 01:55:05.200
- A little like that - yeah, needly, a needly flower
- [UNCLEAR] pick You one
- Hmm

01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:14.920
- and in case, it's going to be our Puja
- [UNCLEAR]
- Oh, that's also [UNCLEAR]

01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:23.420
- We'll see now what's the situation is like. Beautiful, it's very nicely done. Yes, that's the same one? No, this is another wood, I think.

01:55:23.660 --> 01:55:30.740
- That's [UNCLEAR]
- Same as that. This is alright for furniture, I think.
- Hmm.
- This would be.

01:55:31.500 --> 01:55:35.340
So they make here some furniture out of this wood, do they?

01:55:38.460 --> 01:55:46.180
- The, the
- Very strong
- There was a quick desire for furniture like Kaori and [UNCLEAR - REMO?] and so on

01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:50.920
- You'd to have a table and chairs made out of
- Kaori, hmm
- expensive tree
- Hmm

01:55:54.940 --> 01:56:00.080
- Very good collection. You put them up somewhere you're able to see - it's nice.
- Mother, there's, there's

01:56:00.340 --> 01:56:03.680
If you see them as a collection, then you see the beauty of these.

01:56:05.060 --> 01:56:12.780
- Yeah. We bought those since You are interested in eventual about making, making

01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:18.380
what ones were good for making plates are of, in India, so we wondered whether those

01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:26.360
- any of those woods You might like and we could
- make plates
- have plates made for You if You would like them
- Plates

01:56:38.140 --> 01:56:45.400
So the thing is, plates if you make, then we eat anything in it, it can be spoilt because wood doesn't take water [UNCLEAR]

01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:52.560
- What they do here is, they
- Lacquer it
- In the country there's also a wax

01:56:52.780 --> 01:56:58.080
that they, that they use for sealing the wood.

01:56:58.380 --> 01:57:04.920
What is the best for doing anything here is the handles, the door handles of wood?

01:57:05.220 --> 01:57:10.400
Handles is very important. What I've seen that now, you see, we have taken to these

01:57:10.980 --> 01:57:18.280
other metals and all that - after some time these handles become very, very smooth

01:57:18.500 --> 01:57:23.460
so much so that the can't open them; You see, you go on pushing sometimes you get locked with them

01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:30.060
but if you have these handles with little working of brass or something on top

01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:36.280
they will look very nice, I think; Better for making handles than anything like that.

01:57:36.540 --> 01:57:43.780
For these handles for the say, this one for the knives and things, you see - artistic.

01:57:44.620 --> 01:57:50.540
To do something artistic work with them but if you start using them for plates

01:57:51.180 --> 01:57:58.880
they may be spoilt but in India we use lot of it for salads and for dahi.

01:57:59.680 --> 01:58:03.600
They make dahi, actually in the villages they make dahi only in the wooden

01:58:03.940 --> 01:58:10.120
- What is dahi?
- Dahi is yogurt.
- Annh, make it in wood?
- Hmm - is the best, they say.

01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:15.460
- In this you try some dahi - is the best.
- It keeps the heat, isn't it?
- Very good.

01:58:16.780 --> 01:58:22.360
Apart from that, dahi can, you see, metal can be little bit absorbed in the yogurt

01:58:22.620 --> 01:58:29.660
but this is absolutely is, doesn't absorb any acid

01:58:30.460 --> 01:58:36.180
It's very good, so in India mostly they use for dahi - yogurt.

01:58:37.240 --> 01:58:40.940
Dahibada, dahi - anything they make out of dahi, they make it

01:58:46.300 --> 01:58:52.000
- That one is a very knotty wood, it's very twisted
- Annh?
- twisted, knotty that
- That one is

01:58:52.120 --> 01:58:58.260
- that's why it's so difficult to
- unnh, knotted one, unnh but anyone - this one can be used also
-
-

01:58:58.660 --> 01:59:05.320
India we have big, big, things like that, you see, made for this and then we also use it for

01:59:07.320 --> 01:59:13.220
so many things we use wooden things - like for,

01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:20.900
you know, when we make chappatis we have to knead aata - for that also we use the same thing

01:59:21.140 --> 01:59:25.200
- the wooden
- Yes, I mean, in the villages even now they use it.

01:59:25.500 --> 01:59:30.060
- but cities have become so much plastic and stainless steel and all.

01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:36.980
I should tell you, we went to the shop, you see, to buy some things and there the most expensive things were made of plastic

01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:44.800
next to that was glass - really, and third was the moulded glass and the cheapest was

01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:52.960
the hand cut glass from Bohemia [LAUGHTER][UNCLEAR]

01:59:53.180 --> 02:00:00.600
- Topsy turvy
- Really, it's so topsy turvy in one shop it was and people were buying all expensive things like glass and this

02:00:01.320 --> 02:00:06.460
and I bought this Bohemian glass. I said, "This is cut glass. One piece is so expensive in London.

02:00:06.660 --> 02:00:14.200
Here why is it the the other way round people are there," - They are like Indians, I think. Like Indians would buy polyester than cotton sort of thing.

02:00:14.760 --> 02:00:22.780
So, they would buy plastic; Plastics are the most expensive some thing like this plastic was more expensive than the wood itself.

02:00:23.040 --> 02:00:30.040
[UNCLEAR] Warren didn't understand what was the thing going on. There were two other sahaja yogis. They started looking at it. I said, "What is this -

02:00:30.460 --> 02:00:36.200
plastic so very expensive and hand-cut Bohemian glass is the cheapest?"

02:00:36.540 --> 02:00:41.920
What's happening to people? Absolutely, I don't know, what's happening to them?"

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:51.260
Haan, the best part was the cheapest were the silver-plated - that was the best part - 40% less.

02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:58.700
- Cheapest was the silver-plated, pure silver-plated.
- Was this related just to the market? I mean, it wasn't sort of the thing that people pay.

02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:03.800
- this is the sort of money
- This is something, I can't understand the mentality what's happening to them

02:01:04.580 --> 02:01:11.660
- It's like nylon saris.
- It's nylon saris, something like that, same style but I mean, you are developed country, we are developing, so we are stupid.

02:01:12.180 --> 02:01:18.560
I can't understand why should you be that stupid as to have [UNCLEAR]! Best was the Bohemian glass. Then I said,

02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:26.880
"This is just ordinary glass - is more expensive than Bohemian hand-cut; It is really to be seen, I mean, you can't believe it

02:01:28.020 --> 02:01:35.900
such a thing happening. And then, of all the things silver-plated means there's silver plated - such beautiful designs are 40% less.

02:01:40.060 --> 02:01:45.320
Just we couldn't understand. Now, the things would be like this one day

02:01:45.700 --> 02:01:52.580
will be the price of plastic is more than something made of gold.

02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:59.520
If you move in this direction, what is going to happen. Absurd, really absurd!

02:02:01.700 --> 02:02:05.900
There is a link presumably, Shri Mataji, between

02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:11.460
- knowing what is valuable and what is appropriate and what is auspicious.
- Hmm

02:02:11.880 --> 02:02:18.400
Innate value - people know it's innate value. Now of course, the plastic is nice we wash it, put it what you like -

02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:24.260
I mean, it's nice you can throw it where you like, it's very practical, this, that,  it has a practical value

02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:32.660
but still, compared to Bohemian glass, I mean, to buy plastic at an expensive price -  more expensive - this I could not understand.

02:02:34.180 --> 02:02:41.640
- I just could not understand that.
- It is so, it's mass produced so

02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:48.840
- So many [UNCLEAR]
- but that should be cheaper? If it is mass produced, it should be cheaper; It's the other way round.

02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:56.240
Bohemian glass, can you imagine, Bohemian tumblers? I mean, first I saw, then again I couldn't believe.

02:02:56.480 --> 02:03:00.740
-  I called Warren, I said, "See, is it true?"
- "Yes Mother, it is so."

02:03:03.340 --> 02:03:11.300
- So I don't know, where is Australia now, where is it going? Is it developed or developing or
- Going backwards

02:03:11.540 --> 02:03:16.720
And on the other round in the exhibition they were wearing funny dresses like the cave-girls.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:27.760
I think, it's all conditioning of the mind. It's conditioning through the advertisement, this, that. The people

02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:36.520
know things in their mind something and then they see it, they want to buy that; It is more conditioning - they don't have their own personality now.

02:03:36.820 --> 02:03:43.820
No perspective of their own to see things. They, whatever is told to them morning till evening see, just blasted into their heads

02:03:44.040 --> 02:03:50.380
everyday they see in the television this, that, so that's it; That must be the reason.

02:03:56.560 --> 02:04:03.440
- Things that were important here, have a special value.
- No, it was, that's what I am telling

02:04:03.640 --> 02:04:09.700
- [UNCLEAR] see there, they think to be thought of better
- All imported thing?

02:04:10.100 --> 02:04:15.940
That's everywhere but the Bohemian I'm saying, Bohemian glass was the cheapest of all.

02:04:16.380 --> 02:04:23.040
- with hand cut, you know. I was so surprised
- I think, they would be very expensive here.
-

02:04:23.680 --> 02:04:29.640
- Here?
- The Bohemian glass will be very expensive here.
- Here, so then New Zealanders are alright, then.

02:04:29.860 --> 02:04:34.100
[LAUGHTER] I just couldn't understand it.

02:04:35.260 --> 02:04:42.720
Perhaps, you see, what I judged must be this way. That it's a Bohemian glass, then you have to be careful about it

02:04:43.060 --> 02:04:49.940
you have to keep it in the cupboard most of the time to see it and you don't use it much, may be that

02:04:50.220 --> 02:04:55.560
it will break but it is cheaper than plastic then what's the harm.

02:05:03.820 --> 02:05:10.540
German and Bohemian hand cut things they had, German, of course, was not so good.

02:05:10.900 --> 02:05:14.320
but Bohemian, I was surprised - so beautifully done.

02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:24.960
And the silver, the silver-plating was five years guarantee - such good

02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:31.000
and the cheapest of that was stainless steel - it was five times more expensive. Ask Warren.

02:05:31.120 --> 02:05:38.980
"Warren, just tell them about the shop where the stainless steel was five times more than the silver - wasn't it?"

02:05:39.180 --> 02:05:46.680
We were get it through all this. It was Edmund's of all things. You know Edmund's chain of stores in Australia and

02:05:48.520 --> 02:05:54.000
well, we were just going through everything. We found all this beautiful silver and then we started pricing the other things

02:05:54.386 --> 02:05:57.501
and finally we got worked away through the various metals

02:05:57.526 --> 02:06:01.783
and we got to this stainless steel and stainless steel was about three times the price.

02:06:25.684 --> 02:06:29.895
But it's the other way around with glass
too. Did Mother tell you?

02:06:29.920 --> 02:06:30.713
Bohemia

02:06:30.738 --> 02:06:31.785
Bohemian glass

02:06:31.810 --> 02:06:36.710
This hand-cut crystal was cheaper than [UNCLEAR]

02:06:36.735 --> 02:06:41.674
No, and the glass, ordinary glass was
even more expensive than the pressed one
