00:00:01.595 --> 00:00:05.341
Hello Anne, how are you?

00:00:06.611 --> 00:00:12.416
Seminar in Mill Farm – Sherborne, Dorset (UK), 2 August 1981.

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:20.162
What a beautiful place we are all in.

00:00:20.362 --> 00:00:26.858
It’s a real blessing of Sahaja Yoga for all of you to relax,

00:00:27.058 --> 00:00:34.629
relax well. Because in relaxation only you realize that,

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.112
we are now realized souls.

00:00:38.312 --> 00:00:44.641
That we have entered into the kingdom of heaven.

00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:49.753
That we can see the beauty what God has created around us.

00:00:49.953 --> 00:00:52.558
That we have become sensitive to His grace

00:00:52.758 --> 00:00:56.891
and to His kindness and to His love.

00:01:05.506 --> 00:01:09.680
It’s a seminar that you have arranged and I’m very happy.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.063
I always wanted you to arrange seminars

00:01:12.263 --> 00:01:16.212
and that you all should meet together and live together,

00:01:16.412 --> 00:01:20.249
and understand each other.

00:01:20.449 --> 00:01:24.398
The seminars on the gross level

00:01:24.598 --> 00:01:28.919
they work out many things no doubt.

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.740
But on subtler levels, seminars of the Sahaja yogis,

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.345
means a lot.

00:01:38.545 --> 00:01:45.438
It means that a strong nucleus is being consolidated

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:49.254
in various places in a country.

00:01:49.454 --> 00:01:53.316
And these strongholds

00:01:53.516 --> 00:02:00.500
or we can say the strong nucleus which is created like this,

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.338
can form a mechanism by which

00:02:05.538 --> 00:02:13.111
beams of strong vibrations could flow

00:02:13.311 --> 00:02:16.065
or could be thrown all over the places.

00:02:16.265 --> 00:02:25.227
It’s a very great task to build up these mechanisms,

00:02:25.427 --> 00:02:34.204
these divine mechanisms in different parts of your country.

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.237
Please, take her out for a while.

00:02:44.877 --> 00:02:49.349
For example, Mother Earth has done Her job.

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.779
Wherever it was possible for Her, She has created

00:02:54.979 --> 00:03:01.389
living deities

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:05.643
to show that God exists.

00:03:05.843 --> 00:03:09.455
That you can now test their vibrations and see for yourself

00:03:09.655 --> 00:03:11.769
how She has worked very hard.

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:18.566
She has created all this beautiful universe.

00:03:19.785 --> 00:03:23.155
She has created you also.

00:03:23.355 --> 00:03:28.214
She has created the kundalini within you.

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:34.222
She represents the beautiful nature we can say.

00:03:36.018 --> 00:03:41.247
In Her company, in Her bounties when you are drenched

00:03:41.447 --> 00:03:45.603
and you all meet each other,

00:03:45.803 --> 00:03:47.761
you see for yourself

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:52.414
that how She blesses all of you just the same.

00:03:53.195 --> 00:03:57.266
There is no difference

00:03:57.466 --> 00:04:00.362
between you and any other person for Her.

00:04:00.562 --> 00:04:03.721
But those who are sensitive, are subtler people,

00:04:03.921 --> 00:04:09.117
enjoy Her much more than you people do.

00:04:12.296 --> 00:04:15.283
Now the problem that exists in every country

00:04:15.483 --> 00:04:18.471
has its own style I have seen.

00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:23.862
And as in this country also we have a style of problems

00:04:24.062 --> 00:04:27.914
which comes. Gradually it’s changing its form.

00:04:28.114 --> 00:04:32.899
In the beginning I found that people were overaggressive,

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:40.322
sceptical and also could be rude also sometimes.

00:04:40.522 --> 00:04:43.720
It’s all right. Makes no difference to Me.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.433
Now gradually they started changing over.

00:04:47.633 --> 00:04:55.090
Now they are becoming aware of what they have got,

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.052
what role they are playing, how important it is to be an Englishman.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.019
And when I say English I mean all the English people,

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:07.006
not Wales or anything different,

00:05:07.207 --> 00:05:13.375
and how they have to become

00:05:13.575 --> 00:05:17.061
part and parcel of the heart of the universe.

00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:19.344
I wondered how many of you really realize

00:05:19.544 --> 00:05:23.473
how important it is to be an Englishman.

00:05:24.348 --> 00:05:29.110
That everything that happens in this country circulates.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.807
For example if this royal wedding had taken place

00:05:32.007 --> 00:05:37.269
in any other royal family it would not have circulated so much.

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:39.353
Everything circulates from this country.

00:05:39.553 --> 00:05:41.889
Maybe you may not think much of yourself.

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:44.701
You may think that what is so great

00:05:44.901 --> 00:05:48.168
after all this England is like any other country.

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:53.913
But you see why people accept so many things from you?

00:05:54.113 --> 00:05:56.133
Like even a monarchy,

00:05:56.333 --> 00:06:01.016
I mean most of the countries have thrown away their monarchies.

00:06:01.216 --> 00:06:06.612
And in this country it exists and it has a respectable position.

00:06:06.812 --> 00:06:11.368
And the symbol of a monarchy

00:06:11.568 --> 00:06:16.880
is still lingering here in a very proud way.

00:06:17.701 --> 00:06:19.752
Then the marriage itself,

00:06:19.952 --> 00:06:22.022
the marriages of royal families are always detested

00:06:22.222 --> 00:06:26.073
and protested and nobody is interested.

00:06:26.274 --> 00:06:29.479
And such a auspicious thing should take place here

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:33.284
and that everybody should see it.

00:06:33.484 --> 00:06:37.135
So many countries should watch it and appreciate it

00:06:37.335 --> 00:06:40.667
and enjoy it of all the things.

00:06:40.867 --> 00:06:44.492
It’s something surprising.

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:49.026
It transcends all rationality,

00:06:49.226 --> 00:06:53.465
all understanding of even logic

00:06:53.666 --> 00:06:55.511
we can say that what is the logic behind it?

00:06:55.711 --> 00:06:57.530
But if you are enjoying it you just enjoy.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:02.574
You don’t want to think about it why you are enjoying.

00:07:03.505 --> 00:07:06.870
So, one has to understand that you are part and parcel

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:12.180
of the heart of the universe.

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:17.390
One thing is essential

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:22.743
that you have to be very flexible people.

00:07:22.943 --> 00:07:26.871
You have to have

00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:33.033
the flexibility of the heart cells we can say.

00:07:35.472 --> 00:07:40.440
Now heart has to pump.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:46.265
It has to be strong.

00:07:47.278 --> 00:07:50.488
And surprisingly lion is your emblem.

00:07:50.688 --> 00:07:54.441
So you have to have a lion’s heart.

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:56.743
And lion’s heart means he is not afraid.

00:07:56.943 --> 00:08:01.662
He is the king. He knows he’s the king and he lives like a king.

00:08:03.802 --> 00:08:08.876
Like a lion and Leo as in astrology

00:08:09.076 --> 00:08:14.392
or if you say is a man who is extremely generous,

00:08:14.592 --> 00:08:16.807
lion hearted, not afraid of anyone. There should be no fear. But English language if you read anyone or if you listen to anyone, every third sentence he’ll come with the word, “I’m afraid. I’m afraid to say, I’m afraid this is so”… This word must be dropped out from the vocabulary of Sahaja yogis. What is there to be afraid of? Some people say that this is said because we do not want to hurt other people. There are so many other ways of saying things without hurting others. But what is there to be afraid of?

00:08:17.007 --> 00:08:21.187
There should be no fear.

00:08:23.047 --> 00:08:25.082
But English language if you read anyone

00:08:25.282 --> 00:08:27.144
or if you listen to anyone,

00:08:27.344 --> 00:08:30.169
every third sentence he’ll come with the word,

00:08:30.369 --> 00:08:32.802
“I’m afraid.

00:08:33.002 --> 00:08:36.177
I’m afraid to say, I’m afraid this is so”…

00:08:36.377 --> 00:08:40.911
This word must be dropped out from the vocabulary of Sahaja yogis.

00:08:41.111 --> 00:08:44.798
What is there to be afraid of?

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:47.512
Some people say that this is said because we do not want

00:08:47.712 --> 00:08:51.071
to hurt other people. There are so many other ways

00:08:51.272 --> 00:08:53.332
of saying things without hurting others.

00:08:53.532 --> 00:08:56.894
But what is there to be afraid of?

00:08:57.094 --> 00:09:01.183
A man who is weak cannot love.

00:09:01.383 --> 00:09:05.832
Only a strong person can love.

00:09:06.032 --> 00:09:08.043
If you talk of love first of all see

00:09:08.243 --> 00:09:11.045
whether you are strong enough to love or not.

00:09:11.245 --> 00:09:14.115
Loving is not a easy thing, even carnal love,

00:09:14.315 --> 00:09:17.635
even loving your beloved of in the ordinary sense.

00:09:17.835 --> 00:09:20.252
It’s not a easy thing.

00:09:20.452 --> 00:09:25.299
You have to have a very strong moral concept,

00:09:25.499 --> 00:09:30.604
otherwise every third minute people start changing their loves.

00:09:30.973 --> 00:09:33.353
That kind of a love has no meaning.

00:09:33.553 --> 00:09:42.483
You have to have a very firm ideas.

00:09:42.683 --> 00:09:47.183
Not only ideas in your brain but built within you.

00:09:49.891 --> 00:09:54.045
Very few people can really have a love as Romeo had,

00:09:54.245 --> 00:09:56.232
I can tell you this.

00:09:56.432 --> 00:09:59.643
It’s easy to think that you are a Romeo, it’s different.

00:09:59.843 --> 00:10:02.854
You can think you are you are the King of England,

00:10:03.054 --> 00:10:06.651
it’s all right. But you don’t become that way.

00:10:06.851 --> 00:10:10.690
So to be Romeo itself

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:15.026
you have to have a tremendous character.

00:10:15.226 --> 00:10:22.048
A tremendous sense of sacrifice and love

00:10:22.248 --> 00:10:26.634
and understanding of what you want.

00:10:26.834 --> 00:10:33.343
You want to love, that’s all nothing beyond or before.

00:10:35.948 --> 00:10:37.869
I mean a man when he falls in love

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:40.326
he falls in love forever and ever and ever.

00:10:40.526 --> 00:10:45.736
If he falls in love many a times it cannot be love.

00:10:45.936 --> 00:10:48.009
So that experience also

00:10:48.209 --> 00:10:54.732
is sort of is a forbidden fruit for most of them.

00:10:59.847 --> 00:11:07.686
So to love God is even more difficult,

00:11:07.886 --> 00:11:11.415
without seeing Him, without knowing Him,

00:11:11.615 --> 00:11:16.118
without knowing His bounties, without getting realization.

00:11:16.318 --> 00:11:20.143
It is very difficult.

00:11:20.343 --> 00:11:24.820
But today that is not the case.

00:11:27.914 --> 00:11:32.983
But still you have to have

00:11:33.183 --> 00:11:37.092
no fear in your mind, trust,

00:11:37.292 --> 00:11:40.947
you trust yourself and trust others.

00:11:41.147 --> 00:11:45.358
First of all try to trust yourself.

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:48.754
If you have made mistakes, you have to say,

00:11:48.954 --> 00:11:53.339
“Yes, I have made mistakes, all right so what?”

00:11:53.539 --> 00:11:56.698
Trust yourself that you can correct yourself also.

00:11:56.898 --> 00:12:01.406
Trusting doesn’t mean blind ego trip. It does not mean that.

00:12:01.606 --> 00:12:05.203
Trust means that “Yes I can correct myself.

00:12:05.403 --> 00:12:10.762
I can improve. I can do better.”

00:12:10.962 --> 00:12:17.340
Some people think that if you trust yourself

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.504
then you should never confess anything that you have done wrong.

00:12:20.704 --> 00:12:24.842
That you should never say that it was wrong and I can correct.

00:12:25.042 --> 00:12:32.046
This is a wrong idea. You have to trust yourself by saying that,

00:12:32.246 --> 00:12:36.564
“Yes I have done mistakes. I have been doing wrong.

00:12:36.764 --> 00:12:39.736
I have been faltering but I can correct.

00:12:39.936 --> 00:12:41.759
I have that strength within me.

00:12:41.959 --> 00:12:43.728
I can rise above all these things.

00:12:43.928 --> 00:12:51.477
I have that thing within me which I can use to my advantage.”

00:12:55.861 --> 00:12:59.514
Trust yourself. Trust that you are realized souls.

00:12:59.714 --> 00:13:01.714
Trust that God loves you.

00:13:01.915 --> 00:13:06.759
That He has chosen you to be His instrument.

00:13:06.959 --> 00:13:10.709
Love yourself.

00:13:13.178 --> 00:13:16.125
You are unique no doubt.

00:13:16.325 --> 00:13:20.719
As it is human beings, every individual is an unique person.

00:13:20.919 --> 00:13:25.010
But after realization

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:29.468
you are definitely unique person.

00:13:33.122 --> 00:13:37.380
It never means ego trip. One has to use

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:42.255
discretion about understanding. It never means ego trip.

00:13:42.455 --> 00:13:47.931
If you cannot correct yourself, you are not master of yourself.

00:13:52.597 --> 00:13:56.683
Yes you are not perfect.

00:13:58.714 --> 00:14:03.168
You are unique but you are not perfect. You have to perfect yourself.

00:14:03.832 --> 00:14:08.517
These words can be very confusing. When I say you are unique

00:14:08.717 --> 00:14:10.428
immediately, you think you are perfect.

00:14:10.628 --> 00:14:14.784
These are two words, unique and perfect.

00:14:15.084 --> 00:14:17.931
Somebody can be unique

00:14:18.131 --> 00:14:21.042
but he can have imperfections.

00:14:21.242 --> 00:14:23.901
So you have to perfect yourself.

00:14:24.101 --> 00:14:26.878
And trust in yourself that you can perfect yourself,

00:14:27.078 --> 00:14:30.648
through your kundalini awakening, clearing your charkas.

00:14:30.848 --> 00:14:36.028
By understanding yourself, you can perfect yourself.

00:14:37.061 --> 00:14:43.009
You have to perfect. I have so many ways I tell you;

00:14:43.209 --> 00:14:47.468
directly, sometimes indirectly, through friends,

00:14:47.668 --> 00:14:52.972
somehow point out that this is the problem with you.

00:14:54.732 --> 00:14:57.258
You should think that I am within you.

00:14:57.458 --> 00:15:02.290
I am that part within you which is discretion.

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:05.219
When you do not understand your own discretion,

00:15:05.419 --> 00:15:12.339
I try to give you the direction by this way or that way.

00:15:12.539 --> 00:15:17.549
But people feel hurt. People feel bad

00:15:17.749 --> 00:15:19.971
or, some of them accept it.

00:15:20.171 --> 00:15:24.105
If you are seekers and if you are ascending,

00:15:24.305 --> 00:15:26.824
you are definitely unique,

00:15:27.024 --> 00:15:31.026
one specially blessed.

00:15:31.226 --> 00:15:33.567
And you have to pay special attention to yourself.

00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:38.181
You can’t afford to play with yourself.

00:15:39.064 --> 00:15:46.207
So you have to discriminate between ego

00:15:46.407 --> 00:15:51.264
or ego trips as they call it

00:15:51.464 --> 00:15:55.230
and ascent.

00:15:55.958 --> 00:16:02.981
Ego trips bring you back with the worst hurting.

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:07.679
It would be something like throwing you in the air

00:16:07.879 --> 00:16:09.938
and again you come back with a bump and break

00:16:10.138 --> 00:16:13.219
one of your necks or something like that.

00:16:13.419 --> 00:16:15.042
That’s what ego trip is.

00:16:15.242 --> 00:16:20.384
But ascent is where you really rise above.

00:16:20.584 --> 00:16:23.306
Not only that you rise

00:16:23.506 --> 00:16:27.137
but with you,

00:16:27.337 --> 00:16:29.379
you make others rise.

00:16:29.579 --> 00:16:35.704
In your ascent, you develop tremendous powers.

00:16:36.883 --> 00:16:39.558
The higher you ascend the better it is.

00:16:39.758 --> 00:16:42.795
But not by understanding that I am perfect you can ascend,

00:16:42.995 --> 00:16:46.629
never so.

00:16:49.544 --> 00:16:54.286
There’s a story of a teacher and a student.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.028
The teacher was very kind to the student

00:17:00.228 --> 00:17:03.701
and he would come and show him his creations.

00:17:03.901 --> 00:17:07.424
He was very kind to him.

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:10.391
And every time he would say that,

00:17:10.591 --> 00:17:12.352
“I have done this good

00:17:12.552 --> 00:17:15.015
and this is the thing that I have not been able to do

00:17:15.215 --> 00:17:18.550
so will you please tell me how to correct it?”

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:21.502
And the teacher would say, “Yes, good,

00:17:21.702 --> 00:17:25.709
you better correct this part, then do this.”

00:17:27.187 --> 00:17:32.790
And one day the student came and said, “Now this is perfect”.

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:38.205
He said, “You are no more student now.”

00:17:41.111 --> 00:17:45.546
So he said, “No more. You are not to come to me anymore.”

00:17:45.746 --> 00:17:52.814
There was another

00:17:53.014 --> 00:17:58.669
student who was coming every day and correcting himself.

00:18:01.256 --> 00:18:04.295
And he told to his teacher that,

00:18:04.495 --> 00:18:08.487
“Today I think I can teach others but not yet perfect”.

00:18:08.687 --> 00:18:12.585
He said, “All right you go and teach.”

00:18:15.202 --> 00:18:19.084
The third one was a student who came

00:18:19.284 --> 00:18:25.572
and he was always trying to see what was the mistake

00:18:25.772 --> 00:18:28.822
and how he has to correct and how he worked very hard,

00:18:29.022 --> 00:18:32.991
very assiduous, very hard working.

00:18:34.467 --> 00:18:42.379
And he came to his teacher one day and he said, “Sir,

00:18:42.579 --> 00:18:45.184
I will not trouble you anymore now”.

00:18:45.384 --> 00:18:49.860
He said, “True. Now you take my seat.”

00:18:55.898 --> 00:18:59.401
That is what one has to understand.

00:18:59.601 --> 00:19:01.956
You ascend.

00:19:02.156 --> 00:19:04.526
You will become humbler.

00:19:04.726 --> 00:19:06.721
It is just the other way around people understand.

00:19:06.921 --> 00:19:10.605
You see when they ascend they think we have achieved some special powers.

00:19:10.805 --> 00:19:14.714
I don’t know. Suddenly self-certification starts you see.

00:19:14.914 --> 00:19:17.151
I am very good in spirituality.

00:19:17.351 --> 00:19:20.822
I am very high up and all that, this self-certificate starts.

00:19:21.023 --> 00:19:24.856
And then it can reach such a point

00:19:25.056 --> 00:19:29.923
that suddenly you found you are on the earth again.

00:19:31.565 --> 00:19:35.342
This kind of thing is not the way it works out.

00:19:35.542 --> 00:19:37.875
Actually the people who ascend

00:19:38.075 --> 00:19:43.856
there are certain qualities that show on them.

00:19:44.699 --> 00:19:48.296
The first thing is your collectivity.

00:19:48.496 --> 00:19:52.418
How collective you are.

00:19:53.342 --> 00:19:55.908
With how many people you can carry on.

00:19:56.108 --> 00:20:00.006
At how many things you can laugh.

00:20:01.092 --> 00:20:05.187
That is one of the biggest qualities.

00:20:05.751 --> 00:20:08.066
The second quality is that

00:20:08.266 --> 00:20:12.537
how much you accept another’s domination

00:20:12.737 --> 00:20:16.450
who, cuts down your collectivity.

00:20:16.651 --> 00:20:20.382
You must have your personality separate from everyone.

00:20:20.582 --> 00:20:26.274
If you allow others to cut your personality,

00:20:26.474 --> 00:20:31.689
say for example, there is a boss and you are the,

00:20:31.889 --> 00:20:34.382
you are the employee.

00:20:34.582 --> 00:20:38.469
And the boss is not realized soul and you are an realized soul.

00:20:38.669 --> 00:20:42.403
Or maybe both are realized souls. Take it like that.

00:20:42.603 --> 00:20:50.229
And one of them is ascending.

00:20:50.429 --> 00:20:53.018
Then he becomes humbler, he becomes better,

00:20:53.218 --> 00:20:58.015
there are congenial relationship, but to a point.

00:20:58.579 --> 00:21:00.931
He will never compromise with his boss

00:21:01.131 --> 00:21:03.790
when it comes to his ascent, to his collectivity,

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:07.609
to his giving, to his doing things for others.

00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:16.518
On that point he’ll never have any domination because

00:21:16.718 --> 00:21:19.908
how much you feel responsible about yourself

00:21:20.108 --> 00:21:24.642
is the second point.

00:21:24.842 --> 00:21:29.167
How much you are responsible to be there,

00:21:29.367 --> 00:21:31.817
to be a cell in the heart.

00:21:32.017 --> 00:21:36.713
Any cell that fails, fails the heart.

00:21:39.968 --> 00:21:46.371
Every cell in the heart has to be extremely sensitive

00:21:46.571 --> 00:21:53.826
and extremely obedient to the Self, to the Spirit.

00:21:56.271 --> 00:21:59.845
It has to activate, work harder when there is need,

00:22:00.045 --> 00:22:03.744
there emergency.

00:22:03.944 --> 00:22:08.803
That it enjoys the most.

00:22:11.162 --> 00:22:18.603
And no impurity should be allowed, the third point now.

00:22:18.803 --> 00:22:26.688
As I told you first is collectivity, secondly your responsibility

00:22:26.888 --> 00:22:29.393
and third point is purity.

00:22:29.593 --> 00:22:33.833
Purity of your own heart first of all,

00:22:34.033 --> 00:22:39.857
of your own heart, about sincerity, cunningness.

00:22:40.057 --> 00:22:45.285
As I am saying this you will be realizing that all Englishmen

00:22:45.485 --> 00:22:50.754
believe in the contrary,

00:22:50.954 --> 00:22:55.872
nowadays, not olden times, but nowadays.

00:22:56.072 --> 00:23:00.590
Clean heart, transparent, open heart.

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:03.403
Trust others.

00:23:03.603 --> 00:23:08.840
Talk to everyone with an open heart.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.321
Trust others.

00:23:14.401 --> 00:23:16.623
Why do you doubt? If you do not doubt yourself,

00:23:16.823 --> 00:23:19.586
you’ll not doubt others.

00:23:19.987 --> 00:23:22.101
What are they going to take away from you?

00:23:22.301 --> 00:23:25.621
What have you got?

00:23:25.965 --> 00:23:29.118
Nobody can take away your nose, eyes, nothing.

00:23:29.318 --> 00:23:35.410
It’s all quite intact. It’s all nicely glued down.

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:40.098
So nothing is going to disappear.

00:23:40.298 --> 00:23:49.519
What are they going to hurt to a person who is a realized soul?

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:52.774
If your heart is clean,

00:23:52.974 --> 00:23:56.780
you can see the other person clearly through and through.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:00.875
Innocence is such a powerful thing,

00:24:01.075 --> 00:24:04.190
such a powerful thing that even a glance

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:09.608
is sufficient to kill a Satan.

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:16.229
Purity of heart, actually when the heart becomes impure

00:24:16.429 --> 00:24:20.856
the impurity flows down to other places.

00:24:23.942 --> 00:24:26.392
It is not the other way round, is from the heart.

00:24:26.592 --> 00:24:29.869
Many people believe that it’s the body

00:24:30.069 --> 00:24:32.995
that becomes impure. I think it is the heart,

00:24:33.195 --> 00:24:35.441
which becomes really impure,

00:24:35.641 --> 00:24:37.683
and then it starts trickling down to the body

00:24:37.883 --> 00:24:42.571
and then it is residual there. It settles down there.

00:24:46.332 --> 00:24:52.011
So have a clean open heart like a child’s heart. Open heart.

00:24:53.386 --> 00:24:57.279
What is there to be afraid of anyone?

00:24:57.479 --> 00:25:01.386
What is there not to trust anyone?

00:25:02.839 --> 00:25:07.300
What is there to be angry with anyone?

00:25:08.987 --> 00:25:13.022
Talk to everyone, shake hands with everyone,

00:25:13.222 --> 00:25:17.480
be nice to everyone. On the way you find somebody’s difficulty,

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:21.849
give him a hand. If somebody cannot sit properly e.

00:25:22.049 --> 00:25:25.872
or has a problem you try to remove the problem.

00:25:26.072 --> 00:25:30.541
If the person cannot stand, give the place.

00:25:33.048 --> 00:25:35.345
Try to give from your clean heart.

00:25:35.545 --> 00:25:40.100
If your heart is not clean, it can never give.

00:25:43.629 --> 00:25:47.938
Now how do you clean the heart is the subject

00:25:48.138 --> 00:25:50.344
which Felicity wanted me to discuss,

00:25:50.544 --> 00:25:52.064
is how to clean the heart.

00:25:52.264 --> 00:25:57.439
There is no broom available for that in the supermarket.

00:26:00.886 --> 00:26:05.792
There are no Fairy liquids or anything to wash it down.

00:26:14.358 --> 00:26:18.510
But there is a way.

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:22.276
Allow your heart to be drenched in your Mother’s love.

00:26:22.476 --> 00:26:26.281
Just allow. See how much She loves you.

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.770
I trust you.

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:32.714
People laugh at Me sometimes. Some of these saints

00:26:32.914 --> 00:26:34.926
who are supposed to be very great people,

00:26:35.126 --> 00:26:36.973
they can’t understand how I trust you.

00:26:37.173 --> 00:26:41.030
They’d say that oh these are all lost races?

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:45.546
These are horrible people how do you trust them.

00:26:45.746 --> 00:26:49.212
They are not sanyasis, they are not sadhus, they are nothing.

00:26:49.412 --> 00:26:52.276
They are ordinary people.

00:26:52.476 --> 00:26:56.026
For them I mean your value is nothing.

00:26:56.226 --> 00:26:58.035
They’ll if you go to them

00:26:58.235 --> 00:27:02.352
they will make you stand on your head for three months.

00:27:02.552 --> 00:27:05.299
For three years, they may hang you on a well.

00:27:05.499 --> 00:27:08.940
I don’t know what they will do to test you.

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.972
But I trusted you the day I saw you.

00:27:12.172 --> 00:27:15.222
The day you came to me I trusted you.

00:27:15.422 --> 00:27:18.776
And I worked on you from the very first day,

00:27:18.976 --> 00:27:23.712
knowing what you are but I trust your Spirit

00:27:23.912 --> 00:27:27.948
that it would shine, in the same way, trust.

00:27:28.148 --> 00:27:32.776
We laugh at others. I have seen Sahaja Yogis laugh at others;

00:27:32.976 --> 00:27:37.656
make fun of them when they come to Me.

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:39.840
Trust them.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:44.376
When you will trust them, you will respect them also.

00:27:46.313 --> 00:27:50.597
So you have to believe

00:27:50.797 --> 00:27:58.850
in yourself and enjoy the way

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:03.504
gently you are sweeping

00:28:03.704 --> 00:28:06.795
into the current of your Mother’s love.

00:28:06.995 --> 00:28:10.736
Just enjoy that.

00:28:12.455 --> 00:28:17.231
Like a flower that falls into the current

00:28:17.431 --> 00:28:23.796
and flows and enjoys all the beauties of that current.

00:28:23.996 --> 00:28:27.640
In the same way,

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:31.226
you should enjoy.

00:28:33.773 --> 00:28:39.492
When that enjoyment comes into you, you will start trusting.

00:28:40.398 --> 00:28:44.296
And trust your Mother.

00:28:46.524 --> 00:28:50.192
I try many things to correct you.

00:28:50.392 --> 00:28:54.177
But trust in one thing, that whatever I try for you

00:28:54.377 --> 00:28:58.116
or do anything,

00:28:58.316 --> 00:29:03.992
anything I may do for you it is just to clean you.

00:29:04.192 --> 00:29:07.692
That’s My job.

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:14.039
May sometimes you might feel I am publicly saying things for you.

00:29:14.239 --> 00:29:16.642
May be your images are being ruined by that

00:29:16.842 --> 00:29:21.992
or whatever you may think. That’s not the way,

00:29:24.303 --> 00:29:30.608
is for your hitha, is for the well-being of your Spirit.

00:29:34.791 --> 00:29:39.885
And that is the most difficult job.

00:29:43.869 --> 00:29:47.725
With all this,

00:29:47.925 --> 00:29:51.489
trust in your heart.

00:29:52.989 --> 00:29:55.937
First trust yourself,

00:29:56.137 --> 00:29:58.422
trust others,

00:29:58.622 --> 00:30:01.215
other Sahaja Yogis.

00:30:01.415 --> 00:30:03.965
Love thy neighbour as thyself. Who is your neighbour?

00:30:04.165 --> 00:30:07.097
He is a Sahaja Yogi.

00:30:07.297 --> 00:30:10.297
Stand by him.

00:30:15.809 --> 00:30:18.220
And trust your Mother.

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:23.493
As I have trusted you, you have to trust Me,

00:30:25.798 --> 00:30:28.798
and it will work out.

00:30:30.118 --> 00:30:34.778
Open your heart to this trust.

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:43.299
You should not worry whether it would be

00:30:43.499 --> 00:30:45.832
protocolish all right or not,

00:30:46.032 --> 00:30:52.107
whether it would be absolutely respectable or not,

00:30:52.307 --> 00:30:55.380
because heart knows. Whatever your heart will do

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:59.096
in its genuine form will be respectable,

00:30:59.296 --> 00:31:04.494
because there resides your Spirit, which manifests.

00:31:04.694 --> 00:31:08.744
That will look after you. By outer forms,

00:31:08.944 --> 00:31:13.339
whatever you try is not going to work out.

00:31:13.539 --> 00:31:18.317
It is that trust in your loving heart

00:31:18.517 --> 00:31:20.754
that is going to work. It doesn’t matter.

00:31:20.954 --> 00:31:23.733
You see today she brought some flowers.

00:31:23.933 --> 00:31:27.336
There were some supposed to be weeds according to her.

00:31:27.536 --> 00:31:29.793
She went to the station

00:31:29.993 --> 00:31:33.183
and there she was taking some flowers out.

00:31:33.383 --> 00:31:36.715
And the station master and his wife were very sweet

00:31:36.915 --> 00:31:39.742
and they said, “Oh go ahead. They are only weeds you can have them.”

00:31:39.942 --> 00:31:41.500
And they are so fragrant.

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.773
One of the most fragrant flowers I have ever seen.

00:31:44.973 --> 00:31:46.884
They are just weeds.

00:31:47.084 --> 00:31:50.105
They do not conform to any formal flowers,

00:31:50.305 --> 00:31:55.977
but just few flowers attached to other flowers were most fragrant.

00:31:57.352 --> 00:32:01.920
Love gives all the sophistication and the fragrance

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:06.057
and all the breeding that is required.

00:32:06.862 --> 00:32:12.835
Not talking of love but really loving is the way,

00:32:14.592 --> 00:32:17.772
is most enjoyable.

00:32:18.305 --> 00:32:23.241
Today I wanted to tell you something good about Greece

00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:26.510
before we start off with the Puja for about ten minutes.

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:28.531
Very interesting things have happened.

00:32:28.731 --> 00:32:35.647
When I went to Greece, I knew that I had to go to Greece.

00:32:35.897 --> 00:32:40.733
And they told me that they believed in the beginning in one Mother,

00:32:40.933 --> 00:32:43.750
in one Primordial Mother.

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:48.054
But after sometime there were some Indo-Aryan people,

00:32:48.254 --> 00:32:50.281
Indo-Aryan who came down to them.

00:32:50.481 --> 00:32:52.499
And they said, “Yes there is one Mother

00:32:52.699 --> 00:32:54.548
but She has many aspects

00:32:54.748 --> 00:32:58.728
and these aspects are expressed as different Gods.”

00:32:58.928 --> 00:33:02.339
And then they told about all the Gods, which you know of.

00:33:02.539 --> 00:33:05.519
But they, they later on

00:33:05.719 --> 00:33:10.456
made them absolutely human type of Gods and they spoilt it.

00:33:10.656 --> 00:33:13.574
But still there are certain things so amazing it was.

00:33:13.774 --> 00:33:17.971
Like Athena is the name of the Goddess, the Primordial Mother.

00:33:18.171 --> 00:33:23.465
But Athena Atha, Atha in Sanskrit means the primordial.

00:33:26.879 --> 00:33:30.432
And they got the word from Athena. And to the water they call

00:33:30.632 --> 00:33:34.192
Neeru, Nero. And in Sanskrit it is Nira.

00:33:34.392 --> 00:33:38.038
My name is at home is I am called as Nira,

00:33:38.238 --> 00:33:41.387
means from water.

00:33:46.236 --> 00:33:49.302
It’s very surprising how many words there are,

00:33:49.502 --> 00:33:52.746
like I said – told them about the centers. They said, “Kendro,”

00:33:52.946 --> 00:33:56.115
in Sanskrit it is Kendra.

00:33:56.315 --> 00:34:01.180
But the best was in Delphi when I went,

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:05.680
we were surprised at something they said,

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:11.449
“That it is the navel of the universe”.

00:34:12.535 --> 00:34:18.625
I said, “Europe is the liver and Greece is the navel.”

00:34:18.825 --> 00:34:22.669
They showed a point that is the navel it was vibrating.

00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:26.507
And not only that but they showed the most remarkable thing

00:34:26.707 --> 00:34:30.163
was that this is the mound,

00:34:30.363 --> 00:34:36.803
which is actually the expression of the navel is the mound

00:34:37.003 --> 00:34:39.349
which is actually has come out the Mother Earth

00:34:39.549 --> 00:34:41.489
is the one this one.

00:34:41.689 --> 00:34:44.405
And this is actually Athena according to them.

00:34:44.605 --> 00:34:48.266
This is that has come out of the Mother Earth.

00:34:48.466 --> 00:34:51.298
I saw the vibrations were tremendous.

00:34:51.498 --> 00:34:54.462
And next to that there were lot of vibrations coming

00:34:54.662 --> 00:34:57.980
so I turned round and what I find? Is a Ganesha,

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:05.092
absolute Ganesha there sitting down with a beautiful trunk,

00:35:05.292 --> 00:35:10.103
the face and the ears and the eyes, and the stomach!

00:35:10.303 --> 00:35:12.104
Can you believe it?

00:35:12.304 --> 00:35:16.268
Sitting next to Her and absolutely the vibrations coming.

00:35:16.468 --> 00:35:19.778
I mean I didn’t have a photograph I mean camera or anything

00:35:19.978 --> 00:35:21.559
otherwise I would have taken a photograph

00:35:21.759 --> 00:35:23.858
but now if you go and you can see.

00:35:24.058 --> 00:35:27.787
Another thing is they showed the egg, just imagine,

00:35:27.987 --> 00:35:32.599
and the eternal egg from where the other eggs come out you see!

00:35:32.799 --> 00:35:36.037
And the eggs are shown divided the same way into spindles

00:35:36.237 --> 00:35:40.176
as they do which doctors know they have seen under microscope.

00:35:40.376 --> 00:35:44.754
But how did they see, those Greeks? God only knows.

00:35:44.954 --> 00:35:47.940
But there’s another side to it.

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:51.538
First they use to get Amruta. t.

00:35:51.738 --> 00:35:55.819
Is the one that was meant for the Gods

00:35:56.019 --> 00:35:59.007
by which they were given eternal life

00:35:59.207 --> 00:36:03.952
in the sense they were appointed as permanent features you see.

00:36:04.152 --> 00:36:08.176
But then the same thing they wanted everybody to have

00:36:08.376 --> 00:36:11.723
so they started using some that was called as ambrosia.

00:36:11.923 --> 00:36:14.059
They converted into something else

00:36:14.259 --> 00:36:16.478
and they started calling it Ambrosia

00:36:16.678 --> 00:36:19.814
and some sort of a LSD business.

00:36:20.014 --> 00:36:22.425
So also, they went into trance

00:36:22.625 --> 00:36:26.667
so the rest of it is all supra-conscious.

00:36:26.867 --> 00:36:30.031
And that supra-conscious also side by side exists.

00:36:30.231 --> 00:36:33.234
Now discretion has to be used

00:36:33.434 --> 00:36:37.431
how around reality always supra-conscious

00:36:37.631 --> 00:36:42.880
or collective subconscious works out, one way or the other.

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:46.106
And you have to go to the point where the reality exists.

00:36:46.306 --> 00:36:49.606
But what happens you get lost into the supra-conscious

00:36:49.806 --> 00:36:53.633
or you get lost into the superego or we can say the,

00:36:53.833 --> 00:36:56.977
the collective subconscious area.

00:36:57.177 --> 00:36:59.341
So you see both things are to be found out,

00:36:59.542 --> 00:37:01.571
Like an Indian temple, you go,

00:37:01.771 --> 00:37:04.773
you’ll find all surrounded by collective subconscious.

00:37:04.973 --> 00:37:07.244
Too much ritualism, ritualistic,

00:37:07.444 --> 00:37:09.681
ritualism takes them to the left side.

00:37:09.881 --> 00:37:17.895
With that they go to the problem of getting all these women

00:37:18.095 --> 00:37:22.387
who get spirits, they go on, “hoohoohoo” before the deities,

00:37:22.587 --> 00:37:28.025
and then they tell the name of the horse and all those things.
