00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:11.650
I am very, very happy to see so many of you
coming down here for the program.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:18.769
Actually, I bought this land at least, at
least twenty-five years back.

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:27.200
I couldn’t do anything about it as they
had lots of objections, this and that, but

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:35.390
then somehow, I planned the whole thing and
it all worked out.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:44.670
Happy to see you all here but with all those
difficulties ultimately now you find so many

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.829
Sahaja yogis attending this program, My puja.

00:00:49.829 --> 00:01:04.680
I must remember My brother Baba who has worked
very hard for the propagation of Indian music,

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:12.380
classical music, all types of art, whatever
he could do.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.640
It’s a very sad thing that he is not here
today to see you all.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:32.509
He has done so much work religiously without
expecting any reward whatsoever and I wish

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:42.280
you could have him as your ideal and that
will work it out everything in that way.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:51.550
There’s one thing about him I know, he never
tried to show off anything.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:02:04.580
He was very intelligent, educated man but
he caught hold of all the people of ordinary

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:16.879
living and he looked after them and he promoted
their skill of music and art.

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:35.870
With the same idea, I decided to have this
place dedicated to his idea of propagating

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:44.880
music and art and I am happy to see that that
idea has materialized.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.920
But I wish [UNCLEAR.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:53.870
EITHER had or that] My brother was here to
make you feel very happy about it.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.220
He was a very loving and a kind person.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.660
Never used to get angry with anyone, I’ve
seen that.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:09.780
But always he gave Me a very good picture
of every person.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:17.959
You can’t help it.

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:18.306
What are they saying?

00:03:28.644 --> 00:03:31.889
Who is it?

00:03:34.098 --> 00:03:37.176
What happened?

00:03:39.894 --> 00:03:43.457
SY: Volunteers just see who is there.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.815
SM: They are speaking in Marathi.

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:13.083
They are asking where to sit? Nothing else.

00:04:13.284 --> 00:04:14.374
What is it?

00:04:14.573 --> 00:04:18.817
They are saying there is no place. They have to sit on ground.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:28.090
SM: It is the specialty of Maharashtra: quarrelsome nature.

00:04:33.227 --> 00:04:36.696
They are very good at fighting.

00:04:36.897 --> 00:04:41.834
Do anything for them but nothing enters into their head.

00:04:43.351 --> 00:04:47.808
They have no understanding,

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:50.432
always ready to fight,

00:04:50.633 --> 00:04:53.037
even with swords.

00:04:54.483 --> 00:05:00.899
I am fed up with your quarrelling nature.

00:05:01.172 --> 00:05:06.474
This beautiful new building has been erected

00:05:06.897 --> 00:05:08.679
for our classical music.

00:05:08.862 --> 00:05:11.361
They fought even on this

00:05:11.562 --> 00:05:17.773
and many times I felt, why build it in Maharashtra?

00:05:18.241 --> 00:05:22.508
No point doing anything for these quarreling people.

00:05:23.763 --> 00:05:27.302
They fight for some reason or the other.

00:05:27.937 --> 00:05:31.150
They have no shame, nothing.

00:05:32.366 --> 00:05:38.780
If they don’t find a place to sit, what can we do?

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.466
No maturity at all.

00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:53.641
I don’t know how there is music in these quarrelsome people.

00:05:53.842 --> 00:05:57.033
And the music has grown so much.

00:05:59.977 --> 00:06:02.557
Everybody has the same experience.

00:06:02.732 --> 00:06:07.005
In Maharashtra people are very quarrelsome

00:06:08.475 --> 00:06:11.466
and I am fed up with it.

00:06:12.324 --> 00:06:15.771
Everybody is complaining about something.

00:06:16.004 --> 00:06:19.636
Have you not found peace in Sahaja Yoga?

00:06:19.837 --> 00:06:24.314
So many Great Saints & Sages were born in this land

00:06:24.505 --> 00:06:28.933
and they have given so much knowledge.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.777
They have given so much knowledge but there is no effect.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.642
This quarrelsome nature is not going.

00:06:37.843 --> 00:06:41.462
They will fight even in their name,

00:06:42.573 --> 00:06:45.640
keep behaving foolishly.

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:51.269
I don’t know when this foolishness is going to end in Maharashtra.

00:06:55.067 --> 00:06:58.360
They just don’t understand peaceful living

00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:04.317
and absorbing everything peacefully.

00:07:06.294 --> 00:07:10.260
They just start shouting all of a sudden.

00:07:12.622 --> 00:07:15.756
Our foreign Sahaja Yogis say:

00:07:16.016 --> 00:07:18.232
"Are they uneducated people?".

00:07:18.423 --> 00:07:21.955
No, no, they are very well educated,

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.296
but very quarrelsome.

00:07:26.565 --> 00:07:29.842
And why they fight, they only know.

00:07:32.865 --> 00:07:37.325
At least please don’t fight in Sahaja yoga

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:42.383
and be a bit peaceful.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.900
At least try.

00:07:45.367 --> 00:07:48.161
We want to change, isn’t it?

00:07:49.137 --> 00:07:52.954
Instead of finding faults with others,

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:57.195
see what is wrong with yourself.

00:07:58.203 --> 00:08:03.506
Baba has done a lot of work in this mad Maharashtra,

00:08:03.849 --> 00:08:06.213
at Nagpur.

00:08:06.396 --> 00:08:11.203
There are different type of people in Nagpur,

00:08:11.696 --> 00:08:17.832
I want to say there are not only Maharashtrians.

00:08:18.298 --> 00:08:22.345
People in Nagpur are very active and they helped him.

00:08:23.122 --> 00:08:31.113
But nobody understands that you must absorb Sahaja yoga

00:08:31.314 --> 00:08:33.798
and become a Saint (Sadhu).

00:08:33.997 --> 00:08:37.608
That doesn't come in anyone's attention.

00:08:38.489 --> 00:08:40.607
When you think of just making money somehow,

00:08:40.846 --> 00:08:44.076
run helter-skelter for it,

00:08:47.058 --> 00:08:54.811
have such a low manner thinking,

00:08:55.589 --> 00:09:00.571
with such a thinking, how can you be a Sahaja Yogi?

00:09:03.285 --> 00:09:06.318
What should we call them?

00:09:06.644 --> 00:09:10.088
One must feel that: ”I am a realized soul.

00:09:10.295 --> 00:09:11.903
We must achieve some good state”.

00:09:12.104 --> 00:09:15.706
Mother has worked so hard and so much for us.

00:09:15.907 --> 00:09:20.116
So [all of you] decide today

00:09:20.339 --> 00:09:24.175
to stop fighting from now onwards

00:09:25.784 --> 00:09:29.969
and stop being greedy for money,

00:09:30.181 --> 00:09:32.782
which is too much in Maharashtra.

00:09:32.983 --> 00:09:36.544
Here greed for money is amazing.

00:09:37.681 --> 00:09:42.431
Because of greed for money it is difficult to do Sahaja Yoga in Maharashtra.

00:09:42.638 --> 00:09:49.801
I have worked a lot in Maharashtra, beyond the words,

00:09:50.002 --> 00:09:53.581
and have had all sorts of experiences in this land.

00:09:54.064 --> 00:09:58.278
Now please realize that you are a Sahaja yogi

00:09:58.479 --> 00:10:01.348
and live gracefully

00:10:01.549 --> 00:10:04.460
and be proud of being a Sahaja yogi.

00:10:04.667 --> 00:10:09.127
What is there to fight in Sahaja Yoga?

00:10:11.066 --> 00:10:13.661
You have not found a place to sit,

00:10:13.862 --> 00:10:16.735
or you have not found a place to see…

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:21.503
Is this a political meeting or what?

00:10:25.096 --> 00:10:28.890
I did not want to speak anything but I had no option

00:10:29.091 --> 00:10:33.551
when I saw you I had to say it.

00:10:34.185 --> 00:10:39.239
Now if any Sahaja Yogi shows quarrelsome attitude,

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.311
he will be thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:43.901 --> 00:10:46.932
There is no other way to correct this.

00:10:47.143 --> 00:10:49.936
Everyone should live with affection.

00:10:50.424 --> 00:10:52.727
If you cannot behave yourself,

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:56.433
then why are you in Sahaja yoga?

00:10:59.696 --> 00:11:02.562
It is our Baba special character

00:11:02.713 --> 00:11:05.325
that he never got angry with anybody,

00:11:05.526 --> 00:11:08.866
and he would never talk ill of anyone,

00:11:09.064 --> 00:11:14.114
and never complained about anybody.

00:11:14.876 --> 00:11:17.336
He would praise everybody.

00:11:17.537 --> 00:11:20.580
I used to get misguided

00:11:20.781 --> 00:11:24.684
how can everybody have such a good state.

00:11:25.025 --> 00:11:27.293
I would never understand.

00:11:27.494 --> 00:11:32.248
But Baba brought people together with love,

00:11:32.562 --> 00:11:35.149
it may be just anybody.

00:11:35.346 --> 00:11:39.767
He would never sit in My car,

00:11:40.981 --> 00:11:45.028
never visit to My house.

00:11:45.993 --> 00:11:49.535
He was very selfless and understanding.

00:11:49.899 --> 00:11:52.884
He also belonged to this Maharashtra,

00:11:53.085 --> 00:11:56.044
but he was never so rude.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.537
Till the end He was not rude.

00:11:59.738 --> 00:12:03.301
Such a great personality he was.

00:12:03.823 --> 00:12:06.300
You have joined this place,

00:12:06.501 --> 00:12:09.961
so at least follow some of his good qualities.

00:12:12.544 --> 00:12:14.810
Now, this,

00:12:26.367 --> 00:12:30.795
we have built this temple for music

00:12:31.914 --> 00:12:34.868
and other form of arts.

00:12:35.067 --> 00:12:38.630
Your children must progress in these fields.

00:12:38.868 --> 00:12:41.937
They must understand our classical music.

00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:48.977
These foreigners understand your music more than you do, it's a shame.

00:12:50.094 --> 00:12:55.230
We don’t understand basics, taal, nothing,

00:12:56.521 --> 00:12:59.013
then what’s the use?

00:12:59.366 --> 00:13:02.905
You may not be a student of this place,

00:13:03.072 --> 00:13:07.532
still, you must have knowledge about music.

00:13:07.876 --> 00:13:14.078
Unless you know, what is raga, what is tala,

00:13:16.753 --> 00:13:20.276
you cannot enjoy music.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.943
I request you all

00:13:24.738 --> 00:13:29.328
to leave aside your quarrelling nature

00:13:32.398 --> 00:13:36.061
and develop goodness within you.

00:13:36.669 --> 00:13:39.416
This is the work of Sahaja Yoga,

00:13:39.617 --> 00:13:43.041
but, if you sow seeds in unfertile land,

00:13:43.242 --> 00:13:45.399
you cannot reap anything.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.986
I sometimes feel that.

00:13:48.187 --> 00:13:50.099
But now things are better

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:56.052
with many people coming to Sahaja Yoga and they are welcome.

00:13:56.894 --> 00:14:01.365
So, don’t just come to learn music here.

00:14:02.302 --> 00:14:05.301
You must learn to behave in a sahaja way,

00:14:05.502 --> 00:14:08.006
understand the sahaja way,

00:14:08.207 --> 00:14:12.190
understand the greatness of Sahaja Yoga - you should absorb these things within you.

00:14:12.391 --> 00:14:15.116
If you don't learn this,

00:14:15.482 --> 00:14:17.656
it is useless.

00:14:18.956 --> 00:14:22.098
There are many music schools around.

00:14:22.299 --> 00:14:24.743
Everywhere there are music schools.

00:14:24.944 --> 00:14:28.893
By learning music from these schools if you are going trouble others,

00:14:29.094 --> 00:14:32.149
it is better not to learn music at all.

00:14:33.278 --> 00:14:38.677
So I request you all, please,

00:14:39.368 --> 00:14:41.886
that now with this music,

00:14:42.955 --> 00:14:46.249
bring the music of your life

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:49.575
into your day-to-day practice.

00:14:51.321 --> 00:14:53.792
Unless you follow this,

00:14:58.379 --> 00:15:02.880
this program will not be accomplished.

00:15:04.533 --> 00:15:08.337
Take a vow today, we will not fight.

00:15:08.538 --> 00:15:12.302
Even if anyone says anything, we will not fight.

00:15:12.503 --> 00:15:16.112
The second problem here is about making money.

00:15:16.313 --> 00:15:19.603
they are not leaving it at all.

00:15:19.804 --> 00:15:22.952
People make money even in Sahaja yoga.

00:15:23.153 --> 00:15:25.563
They don't understand.

00:15:25.764 --> 00:15:29.708
How did people here get this greed?

00:15:29.909 --> 00:15:33.262
It has spread so much

00:15:36.196 --> 00:15:39.244
that I am fed up.

00:15:39.649 --> 00:15:43.701
Are you going to change or not, now you decide.

00:15:43.902 --> 00:15:47.494
Most important thing is that there should be music in our lives,

00:15:47.695 --> 00:15:50.167
there should be rhythm in our lives.

00:15:50.368 --> 00:15:53.691
Instead of being rhythmic,

00:15:53.892 --> 00:15:59.154
fighting all the time is not proper.

00:16:01.236 --> 00:16:03.944
Thinking bad about others

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:06.332
and seeing only self interest

00:16:06.533 --> 00:16:08.733
it's a wrong quality.

00:16:09.868 --> 00:16:13.262
Now forget what happened in the past.

00:16:13.463 --> 00:16:15.750
You should bring such people in Sahaja Yoga now

00:16:15.951 --> 00:16:18.370
who are understanding, loving,

00:16:18.571 --> 00:16:23.042
and who will bring all people together.

00:16:26.751 --> 00:16:31.452
Fortunately I also know Hindi language.

00:16:31.653 --> 00:16:34.493
And the thing is,

00:16:35.239 --> 00:16:38.551
now if we take to music,

00:16:38.752 --> 00:16:41.630
we ourselves should also be in rhythm.

00:16:41.831 --> 00:16:43.958
What does it mean?

00:16:44.159 --> 00:16:49.914
It means that the state of human beings,

00:16:52.376 --> 00:16:55.066
is to be corrected

00:16:55.654 --> 00:16:58.389
and has to be made rhythmic

00:16:58.564 --> 00:17:01.312
and has to be made organized.

00:17:01.513 --> 00:17:03.162
Unless it is done,

00:17:03.345 --> 00:17:04.818
it is of no use.

00:17:05.019 --> 00:17:08.500
What is the difference between you people and others?

00:17:08.701 --> 00:17:11.317
If you also keep fighting,

00:17:11.518 --> 00:17:13.849
then what is the use?

00:17:14.187 --> 00:17:18.806
The most important thing is that in your mind,

00:17:19.007 --> 00:17:23.799
you should develop love, reverence and devotion.

00:17:24.894 --> 00:17:27.986
so that you become peaceful

00:17:28.153 --> 00:17:30.307
and others also become peaceful.

00:17:30.508 --> 00:17:33.999
Without peace, music has got no meaning.

00:17:35.439 --> 00:17:41.254
Today, with the idea of Baba mama,

00:17:42.098 --> 00:17:46.531
this beautiful building has been erected.

00:17:47.944 --> 00:17:54.053
And with this I wish that people will take to music within them,

00:17:55.002 --> 00:18:00.307
and people have a peaceful atmosphere.

00:18:00.508 --> 00:18:03.810
Today world needs only Peace.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.301
Everything else we have today is worthless.

00:18:07.502 --> 00:18:10.668
We have to see how peaceful we are.

00:18:10.869 --> 00:18:16.279
If this peace does not have an effect on our country

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.783
then on which country will it have?

00:18:18.984 --> 00:18:25.451
Everybody says that India is the ambassador of peace.

00:18:25.652 --> 00:18:28.160
But, I can’t see anything like it.

00:18:28.361 --> 00:18:32.617
There is quarrel and fighting among one another.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.199
Don't know what to say?

00:18:36.721 --> 00:18:39.778
So those who want to learn music,

00:18:39.979 --> 00:18:43.132
must have music in their hearts also.

00:18:44.175 --> 00:18:47.217
Should think from the heart.

00:18:47.418 --> 00:18:51.447
Running after money, running after women,

00:18:51.648 --> 00:18:54.753
and doing all sorts of wrong things

00:18:54.976 --> 00:18:58.725
is unbecoming of a musician.

00:18:58.926 --> 00:19:01.435
My eternal blessings

00:19:01.634 --> 00:19:05.236
that this organization should flourish

00:19:05.967 --> 00:19:10.338
and people coming here should learn music

00:19:10.539 --> 00:19:14.467
and make their lives rhythmic and full of music.

00:19:14.668 --> 00:19:19.206
Hope you will fulfil my desires.

00:19:20.099 --> 00:19:24.415
Whenever you get angry, get annoyed

00:19:25.043 --> 00:19:27.948
whenever you have complains,

00:19:28.149 --> 00:19:34.716
tell yourself that ‘I am a sahaja yogi'.

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:38.546
I am different from others,

00:19:38.747 --> 00:19:42.197
Mother has transformed me into something else.

00:19:42.398 --> 00:19:44.253
If you understand this

00:19:44.444 --> 00:19:47.864
you will recognise your glory.

00:19:48.216 --> 00:19:51.674
But if you cannot achieve this,

00:19:51.875 --> 00:19:54.319
then it is useless.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:59.136
Then making 50 such organizations

00:19:59.581 --> 00:20:02.065
also is of no use.

00:20:03.237 --> 00:20:06.798
Fighting for small, small things,

00:20:07.395 --> 00:20:09.557
doesn't become you.

00:20:09.758 --> 00:20:12.692
You are Saints now.

00:20:12.893 --> 00:20:16.466
You have achieved great heights,

00:20:16.667 --> 00:20:18.902
very great heights,

00:20:19.103 --> 00:20:21.938
And You do not realize that.

00:20:22.139 --> 00:20:26.056
You don't understand that "We are great saints now".

00:20:26.257 --> 00:20:28.363
You think that you are

00:20:28.564 --> 00:20:31.444
the same beggar on the street as you were before.

00:20:31.645 --> 00:20:33.019
No, no.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.963
My special blessings

00:20:36.558 --> 00:20:40.241
that you all should become musical.

00:20:41.601 --> 00:20:44.497
Today I wanted to bless you all,

00:20:44.698 --> 00:20:50.028
that you become completely musical in temperament,

00:20:50.229 --> 00:20:52.624
rhythmic

00:20:53.459 --> 00:21:01.054
and entertaining to others

00:21:01.245 --> 00:21:03.847
and not quarrelsome.

00:21:04.348 --> 00:21:08.127
Now, as you have seen that how the western music

00:21:08.328 --> 00:21:11.238
is taking to wrong side,

00:21:11.439 --> 00:21:13.541
to the wrong progress,

00:21:13.742 --> 00:21:16.970
and I don’t want you to fall into that.

00:21:17.171 --> 00:21:19.590
This will all disappear, I know,

00:21:19.734 --> 00:21:22.717
because it is very destructive.

00:21:23.522 --> 00:21:27.359
But, after coming to Sahaja also

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:30.862
if you have the same destructive idea,

00:21:31.063 --> 00:21:32.961
how can anybody help you?

00:21:33.162 --> 00:21:39.674
So I hope you will fulfill my ideal, about you.

00:21:41.024 --> 00:21:42.658
May God bless you.
