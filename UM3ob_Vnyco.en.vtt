WEBVTT

00:00.890 --> 00:11.650
I am very, very happy to see so many of you
coming down here for the program.

00:11.650 --> 00:18.769
Actually, I bought this land at least, at
least twenty-five years back.

00:18.769 --> 00:27.200
I couldn’t do anything about it as they
had lots of objections, this and that, but

00:27.200 --> 00:35.390
then somehow, I planned the whole thing and
it all worked out.

00:35.390 --> 00:44.670
Happy to see you all here but with all those
difficulties ultimately now you find so many

00:44.670 --> 00:49.829
Sahaja yogis attending this program, My puja.

00:49.829 --> 01:04.680
I must remember My brother Baba who has worked
very hard for the propagation of Indian music,

01:04.680 --> 01:12.380
classical music, all types of art, whatever
he could do.

01:12.380 --> 01:18.640
It’s a very sad thing that he is not here
today to see you all.

01:18.640 --> 01:32.509
He has done so much work religiously without
expecting any reward whatsoever and I wish

01:32.509 --> 01:42.280
you could have him as your ideal and that
will work it out everything in that way.

01:42.280 --> 01:51.550
There’s one thing about him I know, he never
tried to show off anything.

01:51.550 --> 02:04.580
He was very intelligent, educated man but
he caught hold of all the people of ordinary

02:04.580 --> 02:16.879
living and he looked after them and he promoted
their skill of music and art.

02:16.879 --> 02:35.870
With the same idea, I decided to have this
place dedicated to his idea of propagating

02:35.870 --> 02:44.880
music and art and I am happy to see that that
idea has materialized.

02:44.880 --> 02:45.920
But I wish [UNCLEAR.

02:45.920 --> 02:53.870
EITHER had or that] My brother was here to
make you feel very happy about it.

02:53.870 --> 02:58.220
He was a very loving and a kind person.

02:58.220 --> 03:01.660
Never used to get angry with anyone, I’ve
seen that.

03:01.660 --> 03:09.780
But always he gave Me a very good picture
of every person.

03:09.780 --> 03:17.959
You can’t help it.

03:15.719 --> 03:18.306
What are they saying?

03:28.644 --> 03:31.889
Who is it?

03:34.098 --> 03:37.176
What happened?

03:39.894 --> 03:43.457
SY: Volunteers just see who is there.

04:04.800 --> 04:08.815
SM: They are speaking in Marathi.

04:10.809 --> 04:13.083
They are asking where to sit? Nothing else.

04:13.284 --> 04:14.374
What is it?

04:14.573 --> 04:18.817
They are saying there is no place. They have to sit on ground.

04:22.190 --> 04:28.090
SM: It is the specialty of Maharashtra: quarrelsome nature.

04:33.227 --> 04:36.696
They are very good at fighting.

04:36.897 --> 04:41.834
Do anything for them but nothing enters into their head.

04:43.351 --> 04:47.808
They have no understanding,

04:48.009 --> 04:50.432
always ready to fight,

04:50.633 --> 04:53.037
even with swords.

04:54.483 --> 05:00.899
I am fed up with your quarrelling nature.

05:01.172 --> 05:06.474
This beautiful new building has been erected

05:06.897 --> 05:08.679
for our classical music.

05:08.862 --> 05:11.361
They fought even on this

05:11.562 --> 05:17.773
and many times I felt, why build it in Maharashtra?

05:18.241 --> 05:22.508
No point doing anything for these quarreling people.

05:23.763 --> 05:27.302
They fight for some reason or the other.

05:27.937 --> 05:31.150
They have no shame, nothing.

05:32.366 --> 05:38.780
If they don’t find a place to sit, what can we do?

05:42.180 --> 05:45.466
No maturity at all.

05:47.848 --> 05:53.641
I don’t know how there is music in these quarrelsome people.

05:53.842 --> 05:57.033
And the music has grown so much.

05:59.977 --> 06:02.557
Everybody has the same experience.

06:02.732 --> 06:07.005
In Maharashtra people are very quarrelsome

06:08.475 --> 06:11.466
and I am fed up with it.

06:12.324 --> 06:15.771
Everybody is complaining about something.

06:16.004 --> 06:19.636
Have you not found peace in Sahaja Yoga?

06:19.837 --> 06:24.314
So many Great Saints & Sages were born in this land

06:24.505 --> 06:28.933
and they have given so much knowledge.

06:30.040 --> 06:34.777
They have given so much knowledge but there is no effect.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.642
This quarrelsome nature is not going.

06:37.843 --> 06:41.462
They will fight even in their name,

06:42.573 --> 06:45.640
keep behaving foolishly.

06:45.849 --> 06:51.269
I don’t know when this foolishness is going to end in Maharashtra.

06:55.067 --> 06:58.360
They just don’t understand peaceful living

06:58.551 --> 07:04.317
and absorbing everything peacefully.

07:06.294 --> 07:10.260
They just start shouting all of a sudden.

07:12.622 --> 07:15.756
Our foreign Sahaja Yogis say:

07:16.016 --> 07:18.232
"Are they uneducated people?".

07:18.423 --> 07:21.955
No, no, they are very well educated,

07:23.390 --> 07:26.296
but very quarrelsome.

07:26.565 --> 07:29.842
And why they fight, they only know.

07:32.865 --> 07:37.325
At least please don’t fight in Sahaja yoga

07:39.542 --> 07:42.383
and be a bit peaceful.

07:42.860 --> 07:44.900
At least try.

07:45.367 --> 07:48.161
We want to change, isn’t it?

07:49.137 --> 07:52.954
Instead of finding faults with others,

07:53.140 --> 07:57.195
see what is wrong with yourself.

07:58.203 --> 08:03.506
Baba has done a lot of work in this mad Maharashtra,

08:03.849 --> 08:06.213
at Nagpur.

08:06.396 --> 08:11.203
There are different type of people in Nagpur,

08:11.696 --> 08:17.832
I want to say there are not only Maharashtrians.

08:18.298 --> 08:22.345
People in Nagpur are very active and they helped him.

08:23.122 --> 08:31.113
But nobody understands that you must absorb Sahaja yoga

08:31.314 --> 08:33.798
and become a Saint (Sadhu).

08:33.997 --> 08:37.608
That doesn't come in anyone's attention.

08:38.489 --> 08:40.607
When you think of just making money somehow,

08:40.846 --> 08:44.076
run helter-skelter for it,

08:47.058 --> 08:54.811
have such a low manner thinking,

08:55.589 --> 09:00.571
with such a thinking, how can you be a Sahaja Yogi?

09:03.285 --> 09:06.318
What should we call them?

09:06.644 --> 09:10.088
One must feel that: ”I am a realized soul.

09:10.295 --> 09:11.903
We must achieve some good state”.

09:12.104 --> 09:15.706
Mother has worked so hard and so much for us.

09:15.907 --> 09:20.116
So [all of you] decide today

09:20.339 --> 09:24.175
to stop fighting from now onwards

09:25.784 --> 09:29.969
and stop being greedy for money,

09:30.181 --> 09:32.782
which is too much in Maharashtra.

09:32.983 --> 09:36.544
Here greed for money is amazing.

09:37.681 --> 09:42.431
Because of greed for money it is difficult to do Sahaja Yoga in Maharashtra.

09:42.638 --> 09:49.801
I have worked a lot in Maharashtra, beyond the words,

09:50.002 --> 09:53.581
and have had all sorts of experiences in this land.

09:54.064 --> 09:58.278
Now please realize that you are a Sahaja yogi

09:58.479 --> 10:01.348
and live gracefully

10:01.549 --> 10:04.460
and be proud of being a Sahaja yogi.

10:04.667 --> 10:09.127
What is there to fight in Sahaja Yoga?

10:11.066 --> 10:13.661
You have not found a place to sit,

10:13.862 --> 10:16.735
or you have not found a place to see…

10:17.090 --> 10:21.503
Is this a political meeting or what?

10:25.096 --> 10:28.890
I did not want to speak anything but I had no option

10:29.091 --> 10:33.551
when I saw you I had to say it.

10:34.185 --> 10:39.239
Now if any Sahaja Yogi shows quarrelsome attitude,

10:39.440 --> 10:43.311
he will be thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

10:43.901 --> 10:46.932
There is no other way to correct this.

10:47.143 --> 10:49.936
Everyone should live with affection.

10:50.424 --> 10:52.727
If you cannot behave yourself,

10:52.910 --> 10:56.433
then why are you in Sahaja yoga?

10:59.696 --> 11:02.562
It is our Baba special character

11:02.713 --> 11:05.325
that he never got angry with anybody,

11:05.526 --> 11:08.866
and he would never talk ill of anyone,

11:09.064 --> 11:14.114
and never complained about anybody.

11:14.876 --> 11:17.336
He would praise everybody.

11:17.537 --> 11:20.580
I used to get misguided

11:20.781 --> 11:24.684
how can everybody have such a good state.

11:25.025 --> 11:27.293
I would never understand.

11:27.494 --> 11:32.248
But Baba brought people together with love,

11:32.562 --> 11:35.149
it may be just anybody.

11:35.346 --> 11:39.767
He would never sit in My car,

11:40.981 --> 11:45.028
never visit to My house.

11:45.993 --> 11:49.535
He was very selfless and understanding.

11:49.899 --> 11:52.884
He also belonged to this Maharashtra,

11:53.085 --> 11:56.044
but he was never so rude.

11:56.240 --> 11:59.537
Till the end He was not rude.

11:59.738 --> 12:03.301
Such a great personality he was.

12:03.823 --> 12:06.300
You have joined this place,

12:06.501 --> 12:09.961
so at least follow some of his good qualities.

12:12.544 --> 12:14.810
Now, this,

12:26.367 --> 12:30.795
we have built this temple for music

12:31.914 --> 12:34.868
and other form of arts.

12:35.067 --> 12:38.630
Your children must progress in these fields.

12:38.868 --> 12:41.937
They must understand our classical music.

12:42.136 --> 12:48.977
These foreigners understand your music more than you do, it's a shame.

12:50.094 --> 12:55.230
We don’t understand basics, taal, nothing,

12:56.521 --> 12:59.013
then what’s the use?

12:59.366 --> 13:02.905
You may not be a student of this place,

13:03.072 --> 13:07.532
still, you must have knowledge about music.

13:07.876 --> 13:14.078
Unless you know, what is raga, what is tala,

13:16.753 --> 13:20.276
you cannot enjoy music.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.943
I request you all

13:24.738 --> 13:29.328
to leave aside your quarrelling nature

13:32.398 --> 13:36.061
and develop goodness within you.

13:36.669 --> 13:39.416
This is the work of Sahaja Yoga,

13:39.617 --> 13:43.041
but, if you sow seeds in unfertile land,

13:43.242 --> 13:45.399
you cannot reap anything.

13:45.600 --> 13:47.986
I sometimes feel that.

13:48.187 --> 13:50.099
But now things are better

13:50.300 --> 13:56.052
with many people coming to Sahaja Yoga and they are welcome.

13:56.894 --> 14:01.365
So, don’t just come to learn music here.

14:02.302 --> 14:05.301
You must learn to behave in a sahaja way,

14:05.502 --> 14:08.006
understand the sahaja way,

14:08.207 --> 14:12.190
understand the greatness of Sahaja Yoga - you should absorb these things within you.

14:12.391 --> 14:15.116
If you don't learn this,

14:15.482 --> 14:17.656
it is useless.

14:18.956 --> 14:22.098
There are many music schools around.

14:22.299 --> 14:24.743
Everywhere there are music schools.

14:24.944 --> 14:28.893
By learning music from these schools if you are going trouble others,

14:29.094 --> 14:32.149
it is better not to learn music at all.

14:33.278 --> 14:38.677
So I request you all, please,

14:39.368 --> 14:41.886
that now with this music,

14:42.955 --> 14:46.249
bring the music of your life

14:46.450 --> 14:49.575
into your day-to-day practice.

14:51.321 --> 14:53.792
Unless you follow this,

14:58.379 --> 15:02.880
this program will not be accomplished.

15:04.533 --> 15:08.337
Take a vow today, we will not fight.

15:08.538 --> 15:12.302
Even if anyone says anything, we will not fight.

15:12.503 --> 15:16.112
The second problem here is about making money.

15:16.313 --> 15:19.603
they are not leaving it at all.

15:19.804 --> 15:22.952
People make money even in Sahaja yoga.

15:23.153 --> 15:25.563
They don't understand.

15:25.764 --> 15:29.708
How did people here get this greed?

15:29.909 --> 15:33.262
It has spread so much

15:36.196 --> 15:39.244
that I am fed up.

15:39.649 --> 15:43.701
Are you going to change or not, now you decide.

15:43.902 --> 15:47.494
Most important thing is that there should be music in our lives,

15:47.695 --> 15:50.167
there should be rhythm in our lives.

15:50.368 --> 15:53.691
Instead of being rhythmic,

15:53.892 --> 15:59.154
fighting all the time is not proper.

16:01.236 --> 16:03.944
Thinking bad about others

16:04.150 --> 16:06.332
and seeing only self interest

16:06.533 --> 16:08.733
it's a wrong quality.

16:09.868 --> 16:13.262
Now forget what happened in the past.

16:13.463 --> 16:15.750
You should bring such people in Sahaja Yoga now

16:15.951 --> 16:18.370
who are understanding, loving,

16:18.571 --> 16:23.042
and who will bring all people together.

16:26.751 --> 16:31.452
Fortunately I also know Hindi language.

16:31.653 --> 16:34.493
And the thing is,

16:35.239 --> 16:38.551
now if we take to music,

16:38.752 --> 16:41.630
we ourselves should also be in rhythm.

16:41.831 --> 16:43.958
What does it mean?

16:44.159 --> 16:49.914
It means that the state of human beings,

16:52.376 --> 16:55.066
is to be corrected

16:55.654 --> 16:58.389
and has to be made rhythmic

16:58.564 --> 17:01.312
and has to be made organized.

17:01.513 --> 17:03.162
Unless it is done,

17:03.345 --> 17:04.818
it is of no use.

17:05.019 --> 17:08.500
What is the difference between you people and others?

17:08.701 --> 17:11.317
If you also keep fighting,

17:11.518 --> 17:13.849
then what is the use?

17:14.187 --> 17:18.806
The most important thing is that in your mind,

17:19.007 --> 17:23.799
you should develop love, reverence and devotion.

17:24.894 --> 17:27.986
so that you become peaceful

17:28.153 --> 17:30.307
and others also become peaceful.

17:30.508 --> 17:33.999
Without peace, music has got no meaning.

17:35.439 --> 17:41.254
Today, with the idea of Baba mama,

17:42.098 --> 17:46.531
this beautiful building has been erected.

17:47.944 --> 17:54.053
And with this I wish that people will take to music within them,

17:55.002 --> 18:00.307
and people have a peaceful atmosphere.

18:00.508 --> 18:03.810
Today world needs only Peace.

18:04.160 --> 18:07.301
Everything else we have today is worthless.

18:07.502 --> 18:10.668
We have to see how peaceful we are.

18:10.869 --> 18:16.279
If this peace does not have an effect on our country

18:16.480 --> 18:18.783
then on which country will it have?

18:18.984 --> 18:25.451
Everybody says that India is the ambassador of peace.

18:25.652 --> 18:28.160
But, I can’t see anything like it.

18:28.361 --> 18:32.617
There is quarrel and fighting among one another.

18:33.570 --> 18:36.199
Don't know what to say?

18:36.721 --> 18:39.778
So those who want to learn music,

18:39.979 --> 18:43.132
must have music in their hearts also.

18:44.175 --> 18:47.217
Should think from the heart.

18:47.418 --> 18:51.447
Running after money, running after women,

18:51.648 --> 18:54.753
and doing all sorts of wrong things

18:54.976 --> 18:58.725
is unbecoming of a musician.

18:58.926 --> 19:01.435
My eternal blessings

19:01.634 --> 19:05.236
that this organization should flourish

19:05.967 --> 19:10.338
and people coming here should learn music

19:10.539 --> 19:14.467
and make their lives rhythmic and full of music.

19:14.668 --> 19:19.206
Hope you will fulfil my desires.

19:20.099 --> 19:24.415
Whenever you get angry, get annoyed

19:25.043 --> 19:27.948
whenever you have complains,

19:28.149 --> 19:34.716
tell yourself that ‘I am a sahaja yogi'.

19:36.620 --> 19:38.546
I am different from others,

19:38.747 --> 19:42.197
Mother has transformed me into something else.

19:42.398 --> 19:44.253
If you understand this

19:44.444 --> 19:47.864
you will recognise your glory.

19:48.216 --> 19:51.674
But if you cannot achieve this,

19:51.875 --> 19:54.319
then it is useless.

19:54.520 --> 19:59.136
Then making 50 such organizations

19:59.581 --> 20:02.065
also is of no use.

20:03.237 --> 20:06.798
Fighting for small, small things,

20:07.395 --> 20:09.557
doesn't become you.

20:09.758 --> 20:12.692
You are Saints now.

20:12.893 --> 20:16.466
You have achieved great heights,

20:16.667 --> 20:18.902
very great heights,

20:19.103 --> 20:21.938
And You do not realize that.

20:22.139 --> 20:26.056
You don't understand that "We are great saints now".

20:26.257 --> 20:28.363
You think that you are

20:28.564 --> 20:31.444
the same beggar on the street as you were before.

20:31.645 --> 20:33.019
No, no.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.963
My special blessings

20:36.558 --> 20:40.241
that you all should become musical.

20:41.601 --> 20:44.497
Today I wanted to bless you all,

20:44.698 --> 20:50.028
that you become completely musical in temperament,

20:50.229 --> 20:52.624
rhythmic

20:53.459 --> 21:01.054
and entertaining to others

21:01.245 --> 21:03.847
and not quarrelsome.

21:04.348 --> 21:08.127
Now, as you have seen that how the western music

21:08.328 --> 21:11.238
is taking to wrong side,

21:11.439 --> 21:13.541
to the wrong progress,

21:13.742 --> 21:16.970
and I don’t want you to fall into that.

21:17.171 --> 21:19.590
This will all disappear, I know,

21:19.734 --> 21:22.717
because it is very destructive.

21:23.522 --> 21:27.359
But, after coming to Sahaja also

21:27.560 --> 21:30.862
if you have the same destructive idea,

21:31.063 --> 21:32.961
how can anybody help you?

21:33.162 --> 21:39.674
So I hope you will fulfill my ideal, about you.

21:41.024 --> 21:42.658
May God bless you.
