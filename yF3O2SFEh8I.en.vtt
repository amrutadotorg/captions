00:00:08.902 --> 00:00:13.302
First, I will speak in Hindi language and then in English.

00:00:13.542 --> 00:00:17.182
We are such a cosmopolitan people

00:00:17.207 --> 00:00:20.942
that I don’t know what language to take to.

00:00:35.942 --> 00:00:39.462
[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi till 21:39 ]

00:00:41.084 --> 00:00:46.235
Today we are going to worship Shri Shiva.

00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:51.281
In the form of Shri Shiva,

00:00:51.482 --> 00:00:56.106
we have Shri Sadashiva himself,

00:00:56.307 --> 00:01:00.151
and his reflection, Shri Shiva.

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:17.439
This Shiva's form in our heart

00:01:24.582 --> 00:01:28.402
always

00:01:28.603 --> 00:01:34.242
is sitting there in the form of the Spirit.

00:01:35.291 --> 00:01:38.842
I'm not saying it's enlightened there.

00:01:39.572 --> 00:01:45.479
When the Kundalini is awakened,

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.007
this Shiva's form gets enlightened.

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:58.126
And it gets enlightened in our nerves.

00:01:59.501 --> 00:02:02.632
It's said about Chaitanya that it sits on fat.

00:02:02.833 --> 00:02:04.504
First and foremost,

00:02:04.695 --> 00:02:12.322
its light comes to our brain.

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.941
For the first time,

00:02:19.142 --> 00:02:24.072
our heart and

00:02:24.273 --> 00:02:29.239
our brain

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.384
become integrated (unite).

00:02:32.964 --> 00:02:36.701
Otherwise, normally

00:02:36.908 --> 00:02:40.105
man's intelligence runs on one side

00:02:40.306 --> 00:02:44.892
and his emotions run on the other side.

00:02:48.313 --> 00:02:52.913
Due to this union,

00:02:53.114 --> 00:02:59.070
the light which inside us

00:02:59.271 --> 00:03:03.165
spreads from the Spirit,

00:03:03.366 --> 00:03:09.009
that light takes the form of vibrations and appears on our hands and

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.308
on our fontanelle bone area.

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.602
All of you know this.

00:03:18.888 --> 00:03:22.607
But, you should know that

00:03:22.808 --> 00:03:28.505
when this light comes into us,

00:03:28.706 --> 00:03:34.150
we see that gradually our life changes.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.608
All anger

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:45.748
and six enemies within us are finished.

00:03:46.334 --> 00:03:49.816
Gradually everything drops out

00:03:50.017 --> 00:03:54.328
and faith establishes in the mind.

00:03:56.003 --> 00:03:59.897
From faith, wisdom gets awakened.

00:04:00.098 --> 00:04:04.409
Nothing will remain important.

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:13.228
The personality of Shiva that we have seen

00:04:16.353 --> 00:04:21.607
is that of an angel,

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.909
that of a great saint.

00:04:28.148 --> 00:04:31.042
He is like that.

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:35.153
He doesn't care about anything.

00:04:35.354 --> 00:04:41.121
His hair are not properly done.

00:04:41.605 --> 00:04:43.113
Nothing.

00:04:43.343 --> 00:04:50.656
What he is wearing, what should be done, he doesn't think about it.

00:04:52.376 --> 00:04:57.793
He has given all this work to

00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:02.066
Vishnu.

00:05:02.368 --> 00:05:08.787
He wears tiger skin and roams around.

00:05:09.708 --> 00:05:16.421
And his vehicle is Nandi, who

00:05:16.622 --> 00:05:20.014
doesn't come under control in any way.

00:05:20.215 --> 00:05:22.424
It's not like horse that you can control.

00:05:22.625 --> 00:05:27.016
Wherever Nandi goes Shiva goes with it.

00:05:27.217 --> 00:05:34.275
He never thinks that what people will say.

00:05:34.476 --> 00:05:36.649
What will others think.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:43.495
If I dress like this and sit on Nandi, what will people say?

00:05:45.725 --> 00:05:50.333
Because he is contented within himself.

00:05:50.542 --> 00:05:54.715
He is sitting there with his own joy and happiness.

00:05:54.916 --> 00:06:00.938
He doesn't care about anything in this world that

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:04.621
"what will people say?".

00:06:04.883 --> 00:06:07.915
He is not ashamed.

00:06:08.296 --> 00:06:12.544
You must have heard about his wedding.

00:06:12.745 --> 00:06:17.786
When he came for wedding,

00:06:17.987 --> 00:06:23.055
when Shri Vishnu saw him

00:06:23.278 --> 00:06:27.073
he said "who is this funny groom?

00:06:27.274 --> 00:06:30.900
How my sister is marrying him?"

00:06:31.115 --> 00:06:33.893
But Shri Parvati knew that

00:06:34.094 --> 00:06:39.624
her consort would be this, a happy-go-lucky person.

00:06:39.825 --> 00:06:41.905
He doesn't care about anything.

00:06:42.106 --> 00:06:45.030
When a person goes higher than everything,

00:06:45.221 --> 00:06:51.998
for him everything becomes unimportant.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.052
His attention won't go in this direction.

00:06:58.687 --> 00:07:02.042
This Shiva's incarnation that we see,

00:07:02.243 --> 00:07:05.790
looks very dear and beloved to us.

00:07:06.005 --> 00:07:12.825
And everyone thinks that all this done by Shri Shiva

00:07:13.026 --> 00:07:16.490
is very special.

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:22.854
But, when Shiva's light comes into sahaja yogis,

00:07:23.055 --> 00:07:28.098
their life start changing too.

00:07:28.563 --> 00:07:30.680
I have seen that

00:07:30.881 --> 00:07:38.195
before they come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:07:38.396 --> 00:07:44.464
women, men also, liked good clothes very much.

00:07:45.473 --> 00:07:50.741
All their attention used to go on what to wear.

00:07:50.963 --> 00:07:53.671
And these days it's in fashion,

00:07:53.886 --> 00:07:59.641
because everywhere beauty clinics have opened,

00:07:59.888 --> 00:08:03.453
and women are badly stuck in these things.

00:08:03.898 --> 00:08:11.015
But when the beauty comes from the light inside you,

00:08:11.216 --> 00:08:15.523
then all these mundane things have no meaning.

00:08:15.764 --> 00:08:19.692
In the same way, comfort also,

00:08:19.893 --> 00:08:25.325
in a way, people look for the comfort of the spirit.

00:08:25.548 --> 00:08:31.100
They don't look for their personal comfort.

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:35.590
See these foreigners.

00:08:35.821 --> 00:08:39.670
They live in big houses. They have cars and everything.

00:08:39.871 --> 00:08:43.204
But, they come here and just immerse in this atmosphere.

00:08:43.434 --> 00:08:46.334
But Indians are not like this.

00:08:46.675 --> 00:08:53.385
Wherever Indians go, they need attached bathroom,

00:08:53.586 --> 00:08:55.869
and all kinds of comforts.

00:08:56.091 --> 00:08:59.080
Till now they are not able to get over it.

00:08:59.294 --> 00:09:06.372
I'm astonished that in our poor nation they still have such desires.

00:09:07.389 --> 00:09:09.473
It's very astonishing.

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:13.773
People told me Mother please buy a large land for ashram.

00:09:14.162 --> 00:09:17.588
Our Indians never live in an ashram.

00:09:17.789 --> 00:09:22.528
This ashram that we have made with so much of effort,

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:24.998
nobody is ready to live in it.

00:09:25.213 --> 00:09:29.931
I said I will give you salary for staying, they said no.

00:09:30.132 --> 00:09:33.791
My birth place in Chhindwara,

00:09:33.992 --> 00:09:37.410
we spent so much for that house.

00:09:37.611 --> 00:09:40.289
I said those who have retired can stay there,

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:44.945
it has very good climate, it's a hill station. No one was ready.

00:09:45.248 --> 00:09:48.590
Everybody thinks of their own comfort.

00:09:51.503 --> 00:09:56.397
It's not so with these people. They live very happily in ashram.

00:09:57.738 --> 00:10:02.222
My house, my place, my wife,

00:10:02.423 --> 00:10:07.239
food has to be cooked like this, we will eat this style.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.978
We are entangled in taste.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.444
They are not like this.

00:10:13.645 --> 00:10:16.773
They eat Indian food with interest.

00:10:16.974 --> 00:10:19.978
But I know when Indians come to Cabella,

00:10:20.179 --> 00:10:26.032
they will bring Indian breads, pickles, etc. with them.

00:10:26.517 --> 00:10:33.217
Because they can't get over their tongue. They are stuck in taste.

00:10:34.942 --> 00:10:41.647
So, until by meditating you don't get rid of these things,

00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:48.101
you can't go beyond Dharma.

00:10:49.268 --> 00:10:53.978
There is a small thing to understand that

00:10:54.179 --> 00:10:57.427
we lack in sacrifice.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:03.183
This time they said Mother has bought a huge land, spent so much,

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.883
so for puja let's increase the costs.

00:11:08.379 --> 00:11:13.978
I received so many letters asking me to decrease puja money.

00:11:14.316 --> 00:11:19.710
Amazing! One time this puja is happening in Delhi.

00:11:19.911 --> 00:11:22.598
For that too so many letters about puja money.

00:11:22.799 --> 00:11:25.550
They are ready to eat 'paan' (beetle leaf) and throw it

00:11:25.759 --> 00:11:27.789
but won't pay puja money.

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:33.037
I have never taken money from you, I have done everything on my own.

00:11:33.292 --> 00:11:35.759
But asking for such a small thing...

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.745
See today half of the pandal is empty. Why?

00:11:39.946 --> 00:11:42.611
Because they don't want to give money for puja.

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:46.826
They phone and ask me to exempt them from puja money

00:11:47.027 --> 00:11:50.502
Are you in a small job? No, it's not so.

00:11:51.033 --> 00:11:55.623
"My husband will pay, I won't pay."

00:11:55.877 --> 00:11:58.668
I'm amazed.

00:12:00.446 --> 00:12:03.923
If there were a strict guru,

00:12:04.124 --> 00:12:06.758
he would shave your heads,

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:13.747
make you wear crimson color cloth and stand upside down on the head.

00:12:14.676 --> 00:12:18.851
But I don't want this, because it's about being spontaneous.

00:12:19.052 --> 00:12:22.163
Everything must come in that spontaneity (sahaj).

00:12:22.432 --> 00:12:25.735
In my life I have seen many sacrificing people.

00:12:25.965 --> 00:12:29.715
But I don't see it nowadays.

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:32.350
I know about my mother,

00:12:32.551 --> 00:12:37.995
she would give away her sarees if they increased from six to seven.

00:12:42.339 --> 00:12:47.034
It's amazing, when they come to Cabella,

00:12:47.235 --> 00:12:49.385
they need separate room, separate house,

00:12:49.586 --> 00:12:52.792
they want to stay separate. Can't stay with others.

00:12:52.993 --> 00:12:56.763
The person who can't stay with others is not a yogi.

00:12:57.414 --> 00:13:01.245
He still thinks "I'm special, I must have special arrangement".

00:13:01.446 --> 00:13:04.191
He can't be a sahaja yogi.

00:13:05.738 --> 00:13:08.315
He is sahaja yogi by name.

00:13:08.516 --> 00:13:13.171
The one who is Shiva's disciple must be like Shiva.

00:13:13.394 --> 00:13:17.200
Wherever you make him sleep, sit, whatever you give him to eat,

00:13:17.401 --> 00:13:18.819
he doesn't care.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:24.098
He is not time-bound, no desires. He's like that.

00:13:24.299 --> 00:13:26.624
We can say he is a sahaja yogi.

00:13:26.825 --> 00:13:30.522
And Shiva's effect will be on you.

00:13:30.723 --> 00:13:36.368
People do so many things before achieving this.

00:13:36.694 --> 00:13:41.643
In any other place you go,

00:13:41.844 --> 00:13:48.031
they will snatch your money, pull your hair, and what not.

00:13:48.232 --> 00:13:50.833
It's not like this in Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:51.032 --> 00:13:56.169
But this temperament that we have, we must give it up.

00:13:56.591 --> 00:14:02.457
We must try to see what things we can give up.

00:14:04.508 --> 00:14:10.451
Unless this ecstasy comes in you, you can't be Shiva's disciple.

00:14:11.914 --> 00:14:17.184
Mother has all varieties of disciples, nothing special in it.

00:14:18.105 --> 00:14:23.256
All types of disciples. Whatever they do, think Mother will forgive.

00:14:23.457 --> 00:14:28.907
But by forgiving, you will not achieve that state.

00:14:32.058 --> 00:14:38.503
In forgiving, the most important aspect is to ask Shiva to forgive.

00:14:39.559 --> 00:14:41.762
All the time ask for his forgiveness.

00:14:41.963 --> 00:14:47.398
Because all the time we do a lot of things that we shouldn't do.

00:14:47.599 --> 00:14:53.371
We have to ask, "Oh Shambho, please forgive us". (Shambho=Shiva)

00:14:53.924 --> 00:15:00.708
We make many mistakes. We have many requirements.

00:15:01.268 --> 00:15:03.201
We want this and that.

00:15:03.402 --> 00:15:06.979
As long as there is 'I want' within us,

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:11.190
until then you have to keep asking for forgiveness from God.

00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:15.741
And 'my', 'my house', 'my wife',

00:15:15.942 --> 00:15:20.984
this kind of authoritative behaviour that we have in us,

00:15:21.185 --> 00:15:26.429
unless and until we break this we can't be Shiva's disciples.

00:15:26.913 --> 00:15:32.125
It's astonishing that these foreigners have achieved so much of it.

00:15:32.499 --> 00:15:35.190
They had never heard his name.

00:15:35.381 --> 00:15:37.779
And we people are still stuck,

00:15:37.962 --> 00:15:41.271
and believe in it (his name only).

00:15:42.296 --> 00:15:44.501
Being Shiva means:

00:15:44.702 --> 00:15:50.790
All these worldly angles in us,

00:15:50.991 --> 00:15:53.748
whatever hatred is inside us,

00:15:53.949 --> 00:15:56.433
whatever hollowness we have in us,

00:15:56.584 --> 00:15:58.258
give them up.

00:15:58.489 --> 00:16:03.809
But people even after coming to Sahaja Yoga can't see themselves.

00:16:04.485 --> 00:16:08.519
I heard a mother-in-law is torturing her daughter-in-law.

00:16:08.781 --> 00:16:12.866
I asked her why she did it. She said "I have not tortured at all".

00:16:13.152 --> 00:16:14.736
Amazing!

00:16:15.022 --> 00:16:20.411
When they go to cinema and see this kind of torturing they cry.

00:16:20.661 --> 00:16:22.992
But when they come home they torture the daughter-in-law.

00:16:23.193 --> 00:16:25.537
Or the daughter-in-law tortures her mother-in-law.

00:16:25.738 --> 00:16:29.595
But they will say they have never tortured anyone.

00:16:29.887 --> 00:16:36.093
By keeping such lies inside you, you can't progress in Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:36.903 --> 00:16:40.512
Because this changes your life.

00:16:41.147 --> 00:16:44.566
It is your gold.

00:16:44.963 --> 00:16:48.038
And gold can't be tarnished.

00:16:48.239 --> 00:16:50.966
Nothing can color it.

00:16:51.167 --> 00:16:54.714
You have achieved that. Keep that state.

00:16:54.915 --> 00:17:01.711
Why to behave like slaves of worldly things now?

00:17:02.101 --> 00:17:08.765
This is the specialty of kundalini, that she cleans you completely.

00:17:10.376 --> 00:17:13.788
You should also serve others.

00:17:13.987 --> 00:17:16.635
But I don't need your service as such.

00:17:16.836 --> 00:17:20.227
I'm satisfied; what service can you give me?

00:17:20.481 --> 00:17:26.809
You should bring that satisfaction and joyfulness in you.

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:30.695
You should think that everything is for enjoying.

00:17:30.896 --> 00:17:37.082
And if we're enjoying without doing anything, then what's the worry?

00:17:39.233 --> 00:17:44.232
After thinking a lot, I have come to this conclusion that

00:17:44.463 --> 00:17:49.032
Sahaja is very .........

00:17:49.279 --> 00:17:52.724
And that's why it's so difficult.

00:17:52.994 --> 00:17:59.940
If someone takes a stick in hand and tells you to shave your hair,

00:18:00.141 --> 00:18:04.792
wear ........, fast for 14 days,

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:08.457
things will be all done.

00:18:08.663 --> 00:18:12.083
But Sahaja should be accepted from the heart

00:18:12.284 --> 00:18:18.342
and the mind,

00:18:18.557 --> 00:18:23.220
and correct oneself.

00:18:23.421 --> 00:18:29.002
"Why I'm acting this? Should I behave like this?"

00:18:29.203 --> 00:18:31.686
Many things will drop out by this.

00:18:31.925 --> 00:18:35.254
And in a way, you will find yourself.

00:18:35.455 --> 00:18:39.396
You are self-sufficient and you don't bother about anything,

00:18:39.597 --> 00:18:43.908
You don't desire anything. Sitting relaxed!

00:18:44.109 --> 00:18:47.172
And the surprising part is that

00:18:47.373 --> 00:18:53.688
when Chaitanya knows you don't need anything,

00:18:53.889 --> 00:18:57.251
it will give you everything.

00:18:57.452 --> 00:19:01.034
It may be for testing you, may be.

00:19:01.235 --> 00:19:03.979
Then it will see how you react.

00:19:04.273 --> 00:19:08.914
There is no need that it can't fulfill.

00:19:09.115 --> 00:19:13.765
But in this a little dedication is needed.

00:19:14.126 --> 00:19:21.103
Today, we have invoked Shri Shiva.

00:19:23.769 --> 00:19:27.338
But, he likes this type of people.

00:19:27.539 --> 00:19:29.602
The difference between him and me is

00:19:29.803 --> 00:19:33.560
I like all types of people and he doesn't.

00:19:33.844 --> 00:19:38.948
He likes the people who have left all these worldly things.

00:19:39.321 --> 00:19:45.336
These are peculiarities in us.

00:19:45.984 --> 00:19:49.476
In everything... in wearing clothes...

00:19:49.643 --> 00:19:52.817
What will happen if we don't wear like that?

00:19:54.161 --> 00:19:58.572
But, here we don't believe in asceticism.

00:19:58.773 --> 00:20:01.979
You will become an ascetic from within.

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:09.426
When you are ascetic you become desireless and full of joy.

00:20:11.529 --> 00:20:14.521
Earlier there were Nath (=saint) people.

00:20:14.696 --> 00:20:18.415
They used to travel around the world.

00:20:18.616 --> 00:20:22.177
They gave a lot of teachings to the world.

00:20:22.503 --> 00:20:27.126
I was astonished to know where they had traveled to.

00:20:27.412 --> 00:20:33.333
When I went to Colombia, I came to know they had been to Bolivia.

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:39.753
If you go to Colombia, in airplane you'll feel dizzy; it's so high.

00:20:39.991 --> 00:20:43.107
But in those days they used to go on foot.

00:20:43.337 --> 00:20:48.289
How did they reach there? I don't understand.

00:20:48.641 --> 00:20:53.922
In Russia and other countries around they have traveled.

00:20:54.168 --> 00:21:00.935
How they did it, where they stayed, what they wore; nobody knows.

00:21:01.713 --> 00:21:09.320
Because you get at the state where you become mysteriously powerful.

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:14.024
For example, we know Sai Nath of Shirdi.

00:21:14.225 --> 00:21:18.776
He appears anywhere, he can come any time, he can help any one.

00:21:18.977 --> 00:21:24.500
People tell me "Mother we have seen him". I tell them "Yes why not?"

00:21:24.747 --> 00:21:27.455
Such people become immortal.

00:21:27.656 --> 00:21:32.350
Because what can kill them are finished, they become immortal.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:38.834
Achieving that immortality, is the actual worship of Lord Shiva.

00:21:39.382 --> 00:21:43.702
I am talking to them about Shiva’s worship -

00:21:43.982 --> 00:21:46.182
what should happen to you.

00:21:46.382 --> 00:21:48.582
But today, I am going to tell you about

00:21:48.902 --> 00:21:51.302
the internal happening within us

00:21:51.582 --> 00:21:54.462
when you get your Realization.

00:21:54.742 --> 00:21:59.782
There are eleven rudras placed here – eleven of them.

00:22:00.102 --> 00:22:04.262
They are particles, we can say, anshas they call it,

00:22:04.502 --> 00:22:07.461
of Shiva’s powers.

00:22:07.782 --> 00:22:13.622
And all of them try to take out

00:22:13.982 --> 00:22:19.622
or to remove all the false ideas we have about life.

00:22:20.182 --> 00:22:25.782
When the Kundalini rises, they all get enlightened - eleven of them.

00:22:26.142 --> 00:22:28.102
And, say for example,

00:22:28.302 --> 00:22:33.062
Buddha had a part of that, Mahavira had a part of that.

00:22:33.622 --> 00:22:39.262
Now, all of them, what they do is to control us

00:22:39.582 --> 00:22:44.182
from falling into the prey of various things.

00:22:44.502 --> 00:22:47.102
Like, we have an ego.

00:22:47.342 --> 00:22:50.782
So, Buddha will look after the ego part.

00:22:51.062 --> 00:22:56.382
He will see that you get shocked by your ego.

00:22:56.742 --> 00:22:59.022
You will be quite amazed

00:22:59.222 --> 00:23:03.342
how you could be so egoistical,

00:23:03.662 --> 00:23:08.542
and so insulting, and so humiliating.

00:23:08.942 --> 00:23:14.582
But when this rudra is not awakened,

00:23:14.862 --> 00:23:20.461
when there is no light in this rudra, then what happens?

00:23:20.782 --> 00:23:22.702
You start justifying yourself.

00:23:22.942 --> 00:23:25.102
You think whatever you do is correct,

00:23:25.382 --> 00:23:27.822
whatever you’ve done, whatever you’ve said,

00:23:28.022 --> 00:23:32.342
whatever you have achieved,

00:23:32.622 --> 00:23:34.542
you think is your right.

00:23:34.782 --> 00:23:36.822
You’ve done nothing wrong.

00:23:37.062 --> 00:23:43.062
For that, this Buddha’s rudra has to be awakened.

00:23:44.302 --> 00:23:48.662
On the contrary, if you go on pampering your ego,

00:23:48.942 --> 00:23:52.382
if you go on becoming egoistical,

00:23:52.622 --> 00:23:56.902
you become absolutely a right-sided personality.

00:23:57.182 --> 00:23:58.862
Once you are a right-sided personality,

00:23:59.102 --> 00:24:03.742
you know what all the symptoms there are of such a person.

00:24:03.942 --> 00:24:06.542
Now, for that if you just watch

00:24:06.782 --> 00:24:11.902
and introspect and see for yourself what ego has done to you,

00:24:12.182 --> 00:24:15.902
what wrong ideas you had about yourself.

00:24:16.302 --> 00:24:20.182
So that’s why Mohammed Saheb has said, “Beat yourself with shoes.”

00:24:20.542 --> 00:24:23.382
He didn’t know what else to tell.

00:24:23.622 --> 00:24:29.622
Because this ego business can really burst you,

00:24:30.022 --> 00:24:35.222
your head completely, and you may land up into so many difficulties.

00:24:35.462 --> 00:24:41.142
Ultimately, I have seen people developing this yuppie’s disease

00:24:41.422 --> 00:24:47.382
where the conscious mind becomes absolutely useless,

00:24:47.902 --> 00:24:50.062
cannot move.

00:24:50.302 --> 00:24:52.702
Consciously people cannot move.

00:24:52.942 --> 00:24:57.022
Unconsciously they will, but not consciously.

00:24:57.422 --> 00:25:00.622
And this disease is so horrible. A person becomes like a reptile.

00:25:00.862 --> 00:25:03.982
You have to carry them on your body. They can’t walk on their own.

00:25:04.222 --> 00:25:07.422
They can’t sit on their own.

00:25:07.982 --> 00:25:11.302
In a very young age this can happen. This is happening in America.

00:25:11.502 --> 00:25:14.342
Also, I have seen two, three cases here,

00:25:14.582 --> 00:25:16.782
in India, also such a thing happened.

00:25:17.022 --> 00:25:21.702
So if you do not try to see your ego and control it,

00:25:21.942 --> 00:25:25.942
and feel repentant about it.

00:25:26.902 --> 00:25:28.822
In Sahaja Yoga, there is nothing like repentance,

00:25:29.022 --> 00:25:30.622
we don’t believe in repentance.

00:25:30.822 --> 00:25:34.342
Because we believe that you all have got your Realization,

00:25:34.542 --> 00:25:39.462
you are beyond any mistakes. It’s not true.

00:25:41.422 --> 00:25:43.702
We have to repent.

00:25:43.942 --> 00:25:45.942
There’s a, in English, there is a word – sorry.

00:25:46.182 --> 00:25:47.662
Sorry, for everything they will say sorry.

00:25:47.862 --> 00:25:49.902
Even telephone if you pick up, they’ll say, “sorry.”

00:25:50.142 --> 00:25:53.262
I say, “Sorry, for what?”

00:25:53.622 --> 00:25:57.262
But this sorry itself is very empty.

00:25:57.462 --> 00:26:00.782
It has no meaning. It has no depth.

00:26:01.022 --> 00:26:05.182
When you say “sorry,” you have to see why you are saying “sorry,”

00:26:05.422 --> 00:26:08.022
and what is to be corrected.

00:26:08.262 --> 00:26:12.461
This is a very big problem of today’s generation

00:26:12.702 --> 00:26:15.982
where people have developed such tremendous ego-

00:26:16.182 --> 00:26:19.542
because all our economic growth,

00:26:19.782 --> 00:26:24.022
all our industrial developments,

00:26:24.342 --> 00:26:28.022
all our big, big organizations,

00:26:28.262 --> 00:26:32.862
all of them have given us a way

00:26:33.102 --> 00:26:35.342
that we should all develop our ego.

00:26:35.582 --> 00:26:39.942
If we don’t develop our ego we will be lost, we are nowhere.

00:26:40.182 --> 00:26:42.462
And that’s how we start pampering it,

00:26:42.702 --> 00:26:47.662
and then this right-sided problem starts.

00:26:48.982 --> 00:26:52.262
Then as a reaction, it goes to the left side.

00:26:53.142 --> 00:26:55.582
Actually, in the head it is on the right side.

00:26:55.782 --> 00:26:59.142
Here is the right side ego comes up,

00:26:59.382 --> 00:27:04.102
so the left rudra is that of Mahavira.

00:27:06.222 --> 00:27:11.022
So people do things, which are sinful,

00:27:11.902 --> 00:27:16.742
which are wrong, which are against Shri Ganesha.

00:27:17.942 --> 00:27:22.702
Then also there are controlling powers of Mahavira, who controls.

00:27:22.902 --> 00:27:25.982
He says, “You will go to hell; this will happen,”

00:27:26.222 --> 00:27:28.942
he describes all the hell, all kinds of hell,

00:27:29.222 --> 00:27:32.262
that you’ll go to hell and you’ll be burnt alive -

00:27:32.502 --> 00:27:36.662
I don’t know, all kinds of things He describes to frighten you.

00:27:37.142 --> 00:27:40.302
But that doesn’t help.

00:27:40.822 --> 00:27:44.502
So people start getting more onto the left side

00:27:44.742 --> 00:27:45.862
and, I should say,

00:27:46.102 --> 00:27:49.662
through this rudra, when this rudra gets helpless,

00:27:49.902 --> 00:27:53.742
then a tremendous depression comes in.

00:27:54.182 --> 00:27:57.622
One feels very depressed. “Oh God.

00:27:57.902 --> 00:28:01.862
What a depression I have.  I am so sick.  I am this thing.”

00:28:02.102 --> 00:28:07.302
And then you try to frighten others with your depressions.

00:28:07.742 --> 00:28:12.102
You show sort of a, what you call, an emotional blackmail you do.

00:28:12.542 --> 00:28:14.461
All kinds of things you will do,

00:28:14.662 --> 00:28:17.982
and beat your head and do all kinds of things.

00:28:18.222 --> 00:28:21.222
Could be through ego, could be through

00:28:21.422 --> 00:28:29.382
this left side problem of the left rudra.

00:28:29.862 --> 00:28:32.902
These two rudras are very important

00:28:33.222 --> 00:28:36.102
because they are directly connected with our

00:28:36.342 --> 00:28:40.062
left and right sympathetic nervous system.

00:28:40.342 --> 00:28:41.662
So, it’s very important to see

00:28:41.862 --> 00:28:46.542
that you don’t fall a prey to these rudras.

00:28:46.822 --> 00:28:49.742
These rudras are to be satisfied.

00:28:50.022 --> 00:28:54.862
So to be normal, at least look after these two rudras, which are:

00:28:55.062 --> 00:29:00.862
one is the one who controls the ego, and another is self-pity.

00:29:01.302 --> 00:29:05.742
“I just can’t do it, I’m this, that” and all kinds of depression.

00:29:05.982 --> 00:29:10.862
All this works out

00:29:11.102 --> 00:29:15.862
into, physically also, into very serious problems like cancer.

00:29:16.182 --> 00:29:19.622
If the rudras are caught up, you develop cancer.

00:29:19.822 --> 00:29:24.422
But all this portion gets swollen up.  It’s called as the medha.

00:29:24.702 --> 00:29:26.982
This all portion gets swollen up,

00:29:27.262 --> 00:29:31.862
and you can see a cancer patient having a swelling all over.

00:29:32.102 --> 00:29:35.062
At least would be here, or maybe there.

00:29:35.302 --> 00:29:38.662
Because such a swing in the nature of a person

00:29:38.942 --> 00:29:40.022
that you can’t say

00:29:40.262 --> 00:29:44.702
from which rudra they have developed these psychosomatic troubles.

00:29:44.982 --> 00:29:47.942
Psychosomatic troubles, all of them, come

00:29:48.142 --> 00:29:52.982
because the rudras have become ineffective.

00:29:53.422 --> 00:29:59.422
It can be due to the depressive nature

00:29:59.942 --> 00:30:03.622
or oppressive nature.

00:30:03.942 --> 00:30:07.142
It could be due to many other factors also.

00:30:07.342 --> 00:30:10.062
But all these factors are nothing

00:30:10.302 --> 00:30:17.662
but part and parcel of Shri Shiva’s,

00:30:17.902 --> 00:30:20.862
or Sadashiva’s powers.

00:30:21.142 --> 00:30:27.342
He is the one who is full of karuna - full of compassion.

00:30:27.542 --> 00:30:30.742
He is the ocean of compassion.

00:30:30.982 --> 00:30:34.222
If you ask Him forgiveness, He'll forgive.

00:30:34.462 --> 00:30:39.182
Whatever you do, instead of feeling guilty if you ask forgiveness,

00:30:39.422 --> 00:30:41.302
then He forgives.

00:30:41.622 --> 00:30:44.542
But if you think you, whatever you have done is good,

00:30:44.742 --> 00:30:49.942
you’ve never tortured anybody, you have never made anybody suffer,

00:30:50.382 --> 00:30:52.942
then it knows.

00:30:53.862 --> 00:30:56.182
Shiva knows everything, isn’t it?

00:30:56.461 --> 00:31:00.102
And, because it knows, it starts giving up.

00:31:00.342 --> 00:31:06.262
So there’s a big combination of your willpower

00:31:06.502 --> 00:31:11.102
to be there, and the combination of the blessings of Shiva.

00:31:11.382 --> 00:31:14.742
When the Shiva blesses you,

00:31:15.062 --> 00:31:18.102
your willpower also heightens.

00:31:18.342 --> 00:31:22.422
But you must have full willpower

00:31:22.782 --> 00:31:24.342
to know that you have

00:31:24.582 --> 00:31:30.262
to be of a higher level of personality.

00:31:31.102 --> 00:31:33.982
He was not at all a mundane type.

00:31:34.182 --> 00:31:35.502
I mean He was…

00:31:35.702 --> 00:31:39.342
supposing, ask Shiva to go to some party and all that,

00:31:39.542 --> 00:31:41.382
how will He look there?

00:31:41.582 --> 00:31:43.382
People will laugh at Him.

00:31:43.622 --> 00:31:44.822
When I met some hippies, I said,

00:31:45.022 --> 00:31:47.302
“Why are you having this kind of hair?”

00:31:47.542 --> 00:31:50.102
So they said, “We want to -” they are all primitive -

00:31:50.342 --> 00:31:52.222
so he said, “I want to be primitive.”

00:31:52.502 --> 00:31:53.942
I said, “But the brain is modern.

00:31:54.142 --> 00:31:57.942
What’s the use of having primitive hair?”

00:31:58.262 --> 00:32:03.262
So, deception. Deceiving yourself is not going to help.

00:32:03.462 --> 00:32:06.822
Best thing is to face yourself and understand

00:32:07.022 --> 00:32:09.782
what wrong you have been doing.

00:32:10.062 --> 00:32:11.582
If it works out, I tell you,

00:32:11.782 --> 00:32:14.582
so many Sahaja Yogis you are sitting here.

00:32:14.822 --> 00:32:18.222
If you correct yourself and become that

00:32:18.461 --> 00:32:22.062
I am sure all the problems - political, economic,

00:32:22.262 --> 00:32:26.102
and all stupid problems we have - will be finished.

00:32:26.422 --> 00:32:29.461
But today it’s such a mixture, due to Kali Yuga,

00:32:29.662 --> 00:32:35.622
that even the worst people are carrying on.

00:32:35.942 --> 00:32:41.062
Now, we have a responsibility to save this world.

00:32:41.302 --> 00:32:47.222
We have a responsibility to create a great, honorable life,

00:32:47.461 --> 00:32:50.582
which is not superficial, which is not just to show off.

00:32:50.782 --> 00:32:53.382
But inside it should develop

00:32:53.622 --> 00:32:59.582
so that this light of your spirit spreads

00:32:59.902 --> 00:33:02.262
and enlightens this world.

00:33:02.582 --> 00:33:04.702
It’s very important to understand

00:33:04.902 --> 00:33:06.582
all these troubles and these,

00:33:06.782 --> 00:33:09.582
I should say, diseases, psychosomatic diseases,

00:33:09.822 --> 00:33:14.102
and all other problems which are,in a collective way we can call,

00:33:14.302 --> 00:33:20.222
of the Kali Yuga like political, economic, all these problems -

00:33:20.462 --> 00:33:24.182
only are created by human beings.

00:33:24.542 --> 00:33:27.422
They're not created by the Divine Force.

00:33:27.662 --> 00:33:31.862
But Divine Force tries to neutralize them

00:33:32.142 --> 00:33:35.461
if there are many Sahaja Yogis

00:33:35.702 --> 00:33:40.862
who are practicing Sahaja Yoga in the real sense of the word.

00:33:41.462 --> 00:33:47.382
If that could be done, if that could be achieved,

00:33:49.422 --> 00:33:52.142
then I think we can do a lot,

00:33:52.382 --> 00:33:55.461
a lot for the betterment of humanity,

00:33:55.702 --> 00:33:57.822
and that’s why we have got realization.

00:33:58.102 --> 00:34:03.102
It’s not only for yourself, it’s not only for your family,

00:34:03.342 --> 00:34:05.342
it’s not only for your city or country,

00:34:05.542 --> 00:34:10.022
but for the whole world Sahaja Yoga is going to work out.

00:34:10.302 --> 00:34:12.302
Now, if you have to do competition,

00:34:12.542 --> 00:34:17.382
you must only do competition in your ascent and in nothing else.

00:34:17.622 --> 00:34:19.942
But people are so superficial

00:34:20.182 --> 00:34:22.822
that they think by showing off

00:34:23.022 --> 00:34:26.461
or by becoming something – a big Johnny -

00:34:26.782 --> 00:34:31.862
they will achieve something of a very great level, is not so.

00:34:32.342 --> 00:34:38.342
It has to be a very humble attitude towards yourself also,

00:34:38.942 --> 00:34:42.342
so that you understand that whatever you are doing

00:34:42.622 --> 00:34:44.222
is for the betterment

00:34:44.461 --> 00:34:50.222
of global problems.

00:34:50.582 --> 00:34:56.182
Absolutely we can solve because you are the channels of the Divine.

00:34:56.422 --> 00:34:58.382
If I could do it alone, I would have done it.

00:34:58.622 --> 00:35:01.902
But I can’t, so that’s why I had to gather you all

00:35:02.102 --> 00:35:05.142
and to tell you that you become all the channels.

00:35:05.342 --> 00:35:07.742
But in the meanwhile, you enjoy.

00:35:07.982 --> 00:35:13.382
You enjoy life. Every second becomes a joy,

00:35:13.662 --> 00:35:16.622
which is also the gift of Shiva.

00:35:16.862 --> 00:35:19.622
Shiva is the one who creates this

00:35:19.902 --> 00:35:22.982
great admiration

00:35:23.222 --> 00:35:28.422
and great appreciation of every moment,

00:35:28.662 --> 00:35:30.702
everything that is there.

00:35:30.982 --> 00:35:34.022
And that is the state we have to achieve,

00:35:34.222 --> 00:35:36.382
by not condemning yourself,

00:35:36.622 --> 00:35:42.582
or not by pampering your ego,

00:35:42.822 --> 00:35:45.582
but by seeing what you are.

00:35:45.862 --> 00:35:49.942
That’s the main thing one has to see, is what problem you have,

00:35:50.182 --> 00:35:54.262
and what is troubling you is yourself only.

00:35:54.662 --> 00:35:59.182
If you could just come to that point of understanding,

00:35:59.502 --> 00:36:02.822
I am sure, I am very, very sure

00:36:03.062 --> 00:36:07.542
that you will be such an asset

00:36:07.862 --> 00:36:13.822
to help to make this world look at itself and change.

00:36:14.062 --> 00:36:19.302
Because superficially you cannot change such deep-rooted problems.

00:36:19.502 --> 00:36:23.742
And, you are being so blessed by Kundalini

00:36:24.022 --> 00:36:29.822
that you can really become a great

00:36:30.262 --> 00:36:31.982
torch, I should say,

00:36:32.182 --> 00:36:38.102
torch on the path of truth, love and joy.

00:36:38.622 --> 00:36:43.542
May God bless you.

00:36:56.102 --> 00:36:58.902
Today first we'll have a short puja of

00:36:59.342 --> 00:37:00.742
Shri Ganesh

00:37:01.302 --> 00:37:03.142
and then of Shiva

00:37:02.582 --> 00:37:04.662
And lastly of the Goddess.

00:37:04.982 --> 00:37:07.782
We have little bit changed the sequence.
