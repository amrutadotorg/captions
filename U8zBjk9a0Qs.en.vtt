00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.607
Shri Mataji (in Hindi: Sorry I am late, my granddaughter is a little sick

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:18.637
and I stayed back to make her better.)

00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:24.217
First I will speak in English and then in Hindi.

00:00:27.565 --> 00:00:38.115
Today we are going to worship Rajalakshmi,

00:00:39.203 --> 00:00:48.766
means the Goddess which rules the kings.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:00.196
It’s a very important thing today to understand

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:05.922
that something has basically gone wrong

00:01:06.156 --> 00:01:14.511
in the working of our political systems

00:01:16.953 --> 00:01:28.718
and why the people have lost their sense of

00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:39.476
justice, fair play and the benevolence of the people.

00:01:39.726 --> 00:01:47.351
Where have we gone wrong that this is being lost?

00:01:49.576 --> 00:02:00.514
It’s not only in India, it’s not only in Japan or in England

00:02:00.515 --> 00:02:09.578
or any other place where we think there is democracy.

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:27.008
First and foremost thing is that all these countries,

00:02:27.208 --> 00:02:32.108
even those who have got their freedom,

00:02:32.108 --> 00:02:35.457
started following those countries

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.477
which were supposed to be highty and mighty and very powerful

00:02:40.478 --> 00:02:47.914
– like America, like Russia, like China, England –

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:57.652
without understanding how far they have reached

00:02:57.661 --> 00:03:04.171
in delivering the goods that they are supposed to do.

00:03:06.865 --> 00:03:11.514
In any case, in a country like England,

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.780
you see the monarchy, the way it has been working,

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.358
is shocking, absolutely shocking.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:32.647
The way they have acted towards their ministers, like Cromwell,

00:03:34.475 --> 00:03:42.277
you feel as if some primitive people are trying to manage something.

00:03:42.475 --> 00:03:46.738
And the kings so cruel, queens so cruel,

00:03:46.967 --> 00:03:52.147
so character-less, so irresponsible.

00:03:52.162 --> 00:04:00.686
They had no character to be kings and queens.

00:04:04.678 --> 00:04:13.072
There was no surrendering to the Rajalakshmi principle of one’s being.

00:04:15.268 --> 00:04:18.756
Then of course, it became independent,

00:04:18.772 --> 00:04:24.905
and even now I find such stupid things they’re doing.

00:04:25.155 --> 00:04:33.145
Even in France the president has a keep,

00:04:34.208 --> 00:04:38.733
they run after money, little money here and there.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:46.575
There are people in every country who are really of very, very low level

00:04:46.577 --> 00:04:55.425
and who are trying to look after the welfare of the people.

00:04:58.662 --> 00:05:01.577
Also if you read the history of Samurai

00:05:01.577 --> 00:05:05.623
and all those people in Japan you are shocked.

00:05:05.625 --> 00:05:07.167
They thought no end of themselves,

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:12.568
they had no connection with the public and the way they behaved.

00:05:12.335 --> 00:05:18.645
Then you go to the communist countries also the same sort of thing.

00:05:18.514 --> 00:05:24.168
There also those who came in power

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:31.085
became really like despotic rulers.

00:05:31.085 --> 00:05:35.154
Then we have on the other side Mr. Hitler

00:05:35.156 --> 00:05:39.082
who came, thinking no end of himself.

00:05:39.084 --> 00:05:45.483
Spain, as you know was ruined by Franco.

00:05:47.294 --> 00:05:52.295
One cannot understand how these people without any character,

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:58.395
without any higher qualities than the rest of the people

00:05:58.397 --> 00:06:01.904
can look after their well-being.

00:06:01.906 --> 00:06:05.538
It’s impossible!

00:06:10.686 --> 00:06:17.644
I should say in our own country we had great kings, very great,

00:06:17.644 --> 00:06:22.389
because our heritage is great

00:06:22.414 --> 00:06:28.084
and we had saints who really ruled the kings.

00:06:28.365 --> 00:06:36.585
Like Shivaji had a guru who was a great saint, everybody.

00:06:36.585 --> 00:06:39.445
Janaka had a guru.

00:06:39.445 --> 00:06:42.995
Everybody had a guru.

00:06:42.995 --> 00:06:45.575
Even Shri Rama had a guru.

00:06:45.575 --> 00:06:49.085
But they were real gurus!

00:06:49.085 --> 00:06:54.174
They were the people who really lived the life of saints,

00:06:54.174 --> 00:07:00.715
they were real saints, inside, outside.

00:07:00.715 --> 00:07:15.144
And the people also accepted the kings who had spiritual background.

00:07:15.144 --> 00:07:17.565
Those who respected spiritual people.

00:07:17.565 --> 00:07:26.625
So, the whole trend in this country was very, very different

00:07:26.625 --> 00:07:29.555
till sometime.

00:07:29.555 --> 00:07:37.915
I don’t know when the English came what happened to them.

00:07:37.915 --> 00:07:40.375
The majority of the people didn’t like

00:07:40.375 --> 00:07:47.435
the way the English were living, their style, their methods,

00:07:47.435 --> 00:07:50.044
they didn’t appreciate.

00:07:50.044 --> 00:07:54.565
But these king and queens of different states

00:07:54.565 --> 00:07:59.975
they started feeling that they are very sophisticated people

00:07:59.975 --> 00:08:02.815
and we should have their culture.

00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:06.825
And so many of these queens, modern ones,

00:08:06.825 --> 00:08:14.715
who smoke, who drink, tell Me that it was taught by their governess

00:08:14.715 --> 00:08:25.095
who came either from Sweden or from England or from Australia.

00:08:25.095 --> 00:08:28.075
And they picked up these things.

00:08:28.075 --> 00:08:31.825
Of course the men also thought that we are very backward, you see,

00:08:31.825 --> 00:08:34.805
that’s the idea they gave them, “You are very backward people,

00:08:34.805 --> 00:08:39.675
you don’t know how to smoke, you don’t know how to drink,

00:08:39.675 --> 00:08:42.585
you have no ballroom dancing,” this that.

00:08:42.585 --> 00:08:47.015
Even our military got corrupted with it.

00:08:47.015 --> 00:08:49.645
In the military

00:08:49.645 --> 00:08:52.645
is all English style things still going on.

00:08:52.645 --> 00:08:55.285
I don’t know when will they stop.

00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:58.145
They don’t know anything about our own country.

00:08:58.145 --> 00:09:01.115
They’ll know about England,

00:09:01.115 --> 00:09:04.775
and you ask them anything about England they’ll know.

00:09:04.775 --> 00:09:09.815
The whole education system came through English,

00:09:09.815 --> 00:09:16.845
but all about England and western life than about Indian life.

00:09:16.845 --> 00:09:22.735
Nobody ever cared for Indian things, you see.

00:09:22.735 --> 00:09:25.955
Even in medicine same thing happened.

00:09:25.955 --> 00:09:30.445
Nobody wanted to listen to any vaidya (ayurveda) or anyone.

00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:40.265
They thought “Oh, these are useless primitive people, backward!”

00:09:40.265 --> 00:09:44.405
So even one country, which was really, I should say,

00:09:44.405 --> 00:09:57.285
had spirituality ruling in the politics also went down like this.

00:09:57.285 --> 00:10:02.805
Before independence in this country, I remember,

00:10:02.805 --> 00:10:07.425
we had to fight the British,

00:10:07.425 --> 00:10:13.485
and what patriotism people had at that time.

00:10:13.485 --> 00:10:19.075
I remember once we had gone to see a hockey match,

00:10:19.075 --> 00:10:23.555
and My father always had a national flag on it,

00:10:23.555 --> 00:10:26.915
that time it was not national it was congress flag, in the car.

00:10:26.915 --> 00:10:30.475
So the soldiers came, they said, “Take down this flag!”

00:10:30.475 --> 00:10:33.625
So My driver got down he said,

00:10:33.625 --> 00:10:37.945
“You cut my throat first and then you take down the flag!”.

00:10:37.945 --> 00:10:49.335
We all children joined him and they were shocked, went back.

00:10:49.335 --> 00:10:54.775
Such enthusiasm, such patriotism came at that time

00:10:54.775 --> 00:11:04.455
when we were fighting these people.

00:11:04.455 --> 00:11:07.975
But they divided us and created a problem for us.

00:11:07.975 --> 00:11:14.135
And you know before we could enjoy any fruits of our freedom,

00:11:14.135 --> 00:11:21.705
we were fighting, we were divided.

00:11:21.705 --> 00:11:26.245
I don’t know whom to blame for that.

00:11:26.245 --> 00:11:29.595
If we had not accepted this division,

00:11:29.595 --> 00:11:34.455
there would have been no problem.

00:11:34.455 --> 00:11:35.665
But they accepted it.

00:11:35.665 --> 00:11:39.225
Now, poor Bangladeshi’s are so, so, so poor.

00:11:39.225 --> 00:11:46.855
If they were one with India, they would have been much better.

00:11:46.855 --> 00:11:47.935
And what is Pakistan?

00:11:47.935 --> 00:11:50.705
It’s just an empty place, you know,

00:11:50.705 --> 00:11:52.555
no industries, nothing.

00:11:52.555 --> 00:11:57.045
That’s why they are all the time talking about Kashmir, Kashmir.

00:11:57.045 --> 00:11:58.475
They have nothing else!

00:11:58.475 --> 00:12:05.345
[In] their own country people are having fights, this that, but there’s no growth.

00:12:05.345 --> 00:12:09.045
Now they cut out only this India.

00:12:09.045 --> 00:12:20.295
Now here, after all this happening, you know, any war,

00:12:20.295 --> 00:12:27.565
any kind of crisis like that, immediately changes the value system.

00:12:27.565 --> 00:12:31.355
Not that in the West there were no value systems, there were,

00:12:31.355 --> 00:12:39.385
but the war completely changed them in the same way in India also.

00:12:39.385 --> 00:12:44.965
Politicians, those who lost their lives in the fights,

00:12:44.965 --> 00:12:53.575
or those who stood for something good were regarded as no ideal.

00:12:53.575 --> 00:12:58.445
And people took a U-turn, absolutely a U-turn

00:12:58.445 --> 00:13:02.245
and they became very self-centred,

00:13:02.245 --> 00:13:06.485
only worried about their own personal things, their families,

00:13:06.485 --> 00:13:13.275
or maybe accumulation of money and

00:13:13.275 --> 00:13:15.895
transferring of money from here to Switzerland.

00:13:15.895 --> 00:13:20.935
I mean something, I mean I tell you I’ve gone through My life

00:13:20.935 --> 00:13:25.965
with the people who were fighting, fighting for freedom.

00:13:25.965 --> 00:13:32.425
I mean they could not even think of these things.

00:13:32.425 --> 00:13:36.065
I know My father, I know My mother, I know their friends,

00:13:36.065 --> 00:13:41.265
I know so many people who were in our family used to come,

00:13:41.265 --> 00:13:47.535
so many Sikhs and so many other people, Muslims even.

00:13:47.535 --> 00:13:53.635
They could not think of taking any money,

00:13:53.635 --> 00:13:59.965
I mean it was really regarded as very low-level.

00:13:59.965 --> 00:14:09.355
For what to take?

00:14:09.355 --> 00:14:13.675
What is the need?

00:14:13.675 --> 00:14:19.385
If you are satisfied in your heart of what you wanted, you got,

00:14:19.385 --> 00:14:22.475
you’ve got your freedom, now finished.

00:14:22.475 --> 00:14:28.135
But how these people who were absolutely at the bottom,

00:14:28.135 --> 00:14:31.795
who did nothing for the country,

00:14:31.795 --> 00:14:34.835
sacrificed nothing for the country,

00:14:34.835 --> 00:14:43.845
just came up on top and all the good people went down.

00:14:43.845 --> 00:14:51.415
If you read the history of Shivaji,

00:14:51.415 --> 00:14:56.545
or Rana Pratap, or any of them, Shalivahana, anyone,

00:14:56.545 --> 00:15:03.475
you’ll be surprised how they used to worship Shakti.

00:15:03.475 --> 00:15:09.395
All the Kshatriyas used to worship Shakti,

00:15:09.395 --> 00:15:13.285
and they would go up to a point and not beyond.

00:15:13.285 --> 00:15:17.425
Up to the point till the dharma was there.

00:15:17.425 --> 00:15:20.935
That history I cannot repeat it to you.

00:15:20.935 --> 00:15:28.045
But in the subtle way, one feels that

00:15:28.045 --> 00:15:35.455
this partition suddenly changed the attitude of people,

00:15:35.455 --> 00:15:43.055
or I should say those who were very low-level they came up.

00:15:43.055 --> 00:15:49.755
I remember I was here at that time, partition time,

00:15:49.755 --> 00:15:59.565
and I was married and three people came to Me.

00:15:59.565 --> 00:16:02.705
I was sitting outside in the garden,

00:16:02.705 --> 00:16:05.485
knitting something for My child because I was pregnant.

00:16:05.485 --> 00:16:11.315
So they came, and they looked at Me and they said,

00:16:11.315 --> 00:16:17.315
“Can we have one room in your house?”

00:16:17.315 --> 00:16:19.615
I said, “Why not, I’ve got it.

00:16:19.615 --> 00:16:22.215
It’s a very big house of My father.

00:16:22.215 --> 00:16:26.725
I’ll give it to you.”

00:16:26.725 --> 00:16:31.035
They said, “We need for one or two months.

00:16:31.035 --> 00:16:32.035
We are refugees.”

00:16:32.035 --> 00:16:33.035
I said “Alright, and it has an outside door,

00:16:33.035 --> 00:16:36.115
you need not bother us and there’s also kitchen attached

00:16:36.115 --> 00:16:37.415
and a bathroom attached.

00:16:37.415 --> 00:16:40.204
You can do whatever you like.”

00:16:40.204 --> 00:16:43.085
Just I offered.

00:16:43.085 --> 00:16:48.295
In the evening My brother came, elder brother, and My husband

00:16:48.295 --> 00:16:55.145
and both of them were friends and he just started shouting at Me.

00:16:55.145 --> 00:16:56.585
These people were in the other room.

00:16:56.585 --> 00:16:59.245
“What do you mean by keeping such people?

00:16:59.245 --> 00:17:00.245
Who are they?

00:17:00.245 --> 00:17:02.785
What will they do?” and this and that.

00:17:02.785 --> 00:17:06.565
I said, “What will they do?”

00:17:06.565 --> 00:17:08.825
“They may steal something from me!”

00:17:08.825 --> 00:17:12.135
“So what is there in this house to steal?

00:17:12.135 --> 00:17:18.195
They are refugees, look nice people to Me.

00:17:18.195 --> 00:17:22.145
I have approved them because of vibrations they’re alright.”

00:17:22.145 --> 00:17:25.735
“No, no, no, no, no better throw them away!”

00:17:25.735 --> 00:17:29.955
I said, Look at these people [my husband and brother],

00:17:29.955 --> 00:17:34.185
“Without even talking to them, knowing them, suddenly

00:17:34.185 --> 00:17:42.265
you are asking them to get out only because they are refugees.”

00:17:42.265 --> 00:17:47.635
Then I did feel that in this country a new wave had started,

00:17:47.635 --> 00:17:53.725
that a person is not respected if he has no money,

00:17:53.725 --> 00:17:58.055
he’s not trusted if you have no money.

00:17:58.055 --> 00:18:00.495
Actually it is the other way round,

00:18:00.495 --> 00:18:04.085
those who have money, you better never trust them.

00:18:04.085 --> 00:18:07.635
And those who don’t have money are much more honest people

00:18:07.635 --> 00:18:10.985
in this country than the people who have money,

00:18:10.985 --> 00:18:16.825
who are all cheats practically.

00:18:16.825 --> 00:18:20.095
So it happened like this and I said,

00:18:20.095 --> 00:18:22.035
“No they are going to stay here!”

00:18:22.035 --> 00:18:24.685
I put down My foot.

00:18:24.685 --> 00:18:29.785
I said, “This house My father has given Me

00:18:29.785 --> 00:18:32.145
and they are going to stay here.”

00:18:32.145 --> 00:18:39.355
Poor things they stayed for a month in a very,

00:18:39.355 --> 00:18:44.455
I think, must be very much embarrassed.

00:18:44.455 --> 00:18:49.565
And while they were there so many Sikhs,

00:18:49.565 --> 00:18:54.295
that time it was a big organisation – Sikhs and RSS were one,

00:18:54.295 --> 00:18:56.985
and they came to My house and said,

00:18:56.985 --> 00:18:59.415
“We’ve heard there’s a Muslim staying with you.”

00:18:59.415 --> 00:19:00.815
There was a Muslim.

00:19:00.815 --> 00:19:04.045
“And we’re going to kill that Muslim.”

00:19:04.045 --> 00:19:08.825
I said, “What makes you think there’s a Muslim?”

00:19:08.825 --> 00:19:10.425
“We’ve got reports.”

00:19:10.425 --> 00:19:15.205
I said, “Wrong, there’s no Muslim in the house.”

00:19:15.205 --> 00:19:21.055
I told him a lie.

00:19:21.055 --> 00:19:24.965
So they said, “How are we to believe you?”

00:19:24.965 --> 00:19:28.555
I said, “See I’m wearing a thing (bindi).

00:19:28.555 --> 00:19:30.415
I am a Hindu lady.

00:19:30.415 --> 00:19:32.305
How will I keep a Muslim in my house?

00:19:32.305 --> 00:19:39.275
We’re all frightened of them and there’s no one like that.”

00:19:39.275 --> 00:19:41.615
Somehow or other they believed Me.

00:19:41.615 --> 00:19:45.795
I told a complete lie but they believed Me.

00:19:45.795 --> 00:19:54.335
They had brought lots of those swords, with blood.

00:19:54.335 --> 00:20:04.245
But I was not afraid and I told them in a very determined manner.

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:06.855
Anybody else in My place would have said,

00:20:06.855 --> 00:20:15.775
“Alright, alright there is one you can take away.”

00:20:15.775 --> 00:20:22.055
Then these three persons, who were there, left My house

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:27.605
and one of them is a very famous actress,

00:20:27.605 --> 00:20:30.775
another one is a very famous poet

00:20:30.775 --> 00:20:34.525
and another one is a very, very famous writer.

00:20:34.525 --> 00:20:37.875
And it so happened that

00:20:37.875 --> 00:20:43.785
they (a charitable organisation) wanted to make a film about young people

00:20:43.785 --> 00:20:49.855
and I was the chairman of that, vice chairman of that,

00:20:49.855 --> 00:20:52.025
and they wanted to call this actress.

00:20:52.025 --> 00:20:55.465
I said, “Don’t tell her My name.”

00:20:55.465 --> 00:20:58.695
Because I had lost her completely.

00:20:58.695 --> 00:21:02.255
I’d just said let it be wherever they are, let them be.

00:21:02.255 --> 00:21:05.175
There’s no, sort of, I never made any enquiries or anything.

00:21:05.175 --> 00:21:06.405
“Don’t tell them My name.”

00:21:06.405 --> 00:21:07.405
They said “Why?”

00:21:07.405 --> 00:21:15.865
I said, “For some reason you just don’t tell her My name,

00:21:15.865 --> 00:21:19.145
otherwise she’ll be compelled to say yes, which I don’t want.”

00:21:19.145 --> 00:21:22.355
So when they went to her and asked her,

00:21:22.355 --> 00:21:26.635
she said, “I must get a sari, I must get a chappal,

00:21:26.635 --> 00:21:30.065
I must get a purse to match, I must get this,

00:21:30.065 --> 00:21:32.775
all this you have to pay, plus so much money you’ll have to pay.”

00:21:32.775 --> 00:21:34.935
They said, “Ours is a charitable.”

00:21:34.935 --> 00:21:37.465
She said, “Whatever it is.”

00:21:37.465 --> 00:21:42.025
I said, “Alright, give her whatever she asks for.”

00:21:42.025 --> 00:21:47.865
Then I went for the opening ceremony and she saw Me

00:21:47.865 --> 00:21:53.075
and she couldn’t control herself, tears started rolling down her.

00:21:53.075 --> 00:21:55.145
Just came and fell at My feet.

00:21:55.145 --> 00:22:01.065
She said, “How are you here after such a long time?”

00:22:01.065 --> 00:22:05.135
So they said, “She’s the one who’s making this film.”

00:22:05.135 --> 00:22:06.135
“What?

00:22:06.135 --> 00:22:12.615
She’s making this film, why didn’t you tell me?

00:22:12.615 --> 00:22:13.615
My God, my God.”

00:22:13.615 --> 00:22:16.645
She couldn’t help it, she was crying, crying, crying, crying.

00:22:16.645 --> 00:22:18.195
I said, “Now it’s alright.”

00:22:18.195 --> 00:22:20.415
She said, “You take money from me.

00:22:20.415 --> 00:22:23.015
I’ll pay for the whole making of the film.

00:22:23.015 --> 00:22:24.755
You don’t know this lady.

00:22:24.755 --> 00:22:26.145
You don’t know her.

00:22:26.145 --> 00:22:30.565
What She’s done for me, nobody would do [what] she had done.”

00:22:30.565 --> 00:22:36.985
She said, “She never told us anything how are we to know?”

00:22:36.985 --> 00:22:40.635
Such a change that she, immediately she telephoned to her husband

00:22:40.635 --> 00:22:44.635
and to this great poet, they all came running and they all…

00:22:44.635 --> 00:22:52.375
But a small good gesture of administration:

00:22:52.375 --> 00:22:58.825
that was My house given to Me by My father.

00:22:58.825 --> 00:23:02.595
That time of course My husband and My brother

00:23:02.595 --> 00:23:10.475
didn’t know how to trust people.

00:23:10.475 --> 00:23:12.865
But I trusted them, fully.

00:23:12.865 --> 00:23:18.245
They were saying, “They will cut your throat.”

00:23:18.245 --> 00:23:19.245
“Why?

00:23:19.245 --> 00:23:21.555
Why will they cut My throat?

00:23:21.555 --> 00:23:24.735
For what?”

00:23:24.735 --> 00:23:27.335
All kinds of funny things they were thinking.

00:23:27.335 --> 00:23:30.535
And the worst thing I felt was

00:23:30.535 --> 00:23:38.255
they were afraid because they had no money.

00:23:38.255 --> 00:23:43.385
That is the beginning of the end, I think.

00:23:43.385 --> 00:23:49.815
In our country this struggle for money started after that.

00:23:49.815 --> 00:23:54.775
Without money people started suffering very much.

00:23:54.775 --> 00:23:58.645
Poor people don’t mind because they are used to it.

00:23:58.645 --> 00:24:03.385
Whatever money they have, they eat it and sleep off.

00:24:03.385 --> 00:24:08.205
There were not also very, very poor people as they are today

00:24:08.205 --> 00:24:11.335
but they were poor people no doubt.

00:24:11.335 --> 00:24:15.375
But what I realised at that moment,

00:24:15.375 --> 00:24:21.535
that the people who have any position or any power or anything

00:24:21.535 --> 00:24:30.295
are literally frightened of everybody else.

00:24:30.295 --> 00:24:34.945
This is the beginning of our downfall.

00:24:34.945 --> 00:24:40.745
We got frightened.

00:24:40.745 --> 00:24:44.835
Those who were in charge got frightened

00:24:44.835 --> 00:24:54.045
that I may lose my seat or I may lose my money, I may lose my power.

00:24:54.045 --> 00:24:59.375
That fright kept them absolutely mad.

00:24:59.375 --> 00:25:05.425
Supposing I am left with no money.

00:25:05.425 --> 00:25:07.155
So what?

00:25:07.155 --> 00:25:08.885
What happens?

00:25:08.885 --> 00:25:15.895
All these thoughts started coming after that partition, I felt it’s everywhere.

00:25:15.895 --> 00:25:21.115
While I’ll tell you in My childhood,

00:25:21.115 --> 00:25:23.845
My father never used to lock the house, it was a very big house

00:25:23.845 --> 00:25:26.085
he never use to lock.

00:25:26.085 --> 00:25:28.105
And we had a very beautiful gramophone

00:25:28.105 --> 00:25:32.285
will all that horn sort of a thing.

00:25:32.285 --> 00:25:39.205
And one day one thief came and stole that.

00:25:39.205 --> 00:25:44.135
So next day we discovered, My father said,

00:25:44.135 --> 00:25:48.715
“Poor thing, he was fond of music so he’s taken away doesn’t matter,

00:25:48.715 --> 00:25:52.555
but he didn’t take the records now what will he use,

00:25:52.555 --> 00:25:55.115
he must have records.”

00:25:55.115 --> 00:25:56.766
So My Mother started teasing him,

00:25:56.766 --> 00:25:58.895
“Alright you advertise now.

00:25:58.895 --> 00:26:02.015
The one who has stolen our gramophone

00:26:02.015 --> 00:26:07.005
should come and take the records they are available for him.”

00:26:07.005 --> 00:26:10.245
It’s so natural you know.

00:26:10.245 --> 00:26:13.425
He just felt [that] we have money after all,

00:26:13.425 --> 00:26:15.885
this fellow doesn’t have money

00:26:15.885 --> 00:26:22.525
and he wants to listen to music you see.

00:26:22.525 --> 00:26:25.445
So My father said, ‘Alright’.

00:26:25.445 --> 00:26:26.925
Otherwise he was a criminal lawyer

00:26:26.925 --> 00:26:30.115
My father knew law very well.

00:26:30.115 --> 00:26:32.895
Was not a stupid fool

00:26:32.895 --> 00:26:38.845
but he couldn’t understand this fellow has only taken gramophone only

00:26:38.845 --> 00:26:40.125
without the records.

00:26:40.125 --> 00:26:41.125
He said,

00:26:41.125 --> 00:26:45.335
“he must not have found it, you see it was there kept and all that.”

00:26:45.335 --> 00:26:51.995
My Mother said, “You better advertise it.”

00:26:51.995 --> 00:26:55.945
He was a politician also.

00:26:55.945 --> 00:27:02.395
So that time, the feeling among the politician was to

00:27:02.395 --> 00:27:06.395
how to raise the standard of these people

00:27:06.395 --> 00:27:15.314
who are not having what we are having.

00:27:15.314 --> 00:27:23.825
All the people who had money donated lavishly to so many things.

00:27:23.825 --> 00:27:28.735
I mean in My place there was one Rahbahadur Lakshminarayan,

00:27:28.735 --> 00:27:36.285
he donated all his money, everything, to a big university.

00:27:36.285 --> 00:27:39.585
Most of the things that happened in those days

00:27:39.585 --> 00:27:43.815
were done by charity people.

00:27:43.815 --> 00:27:47.155
I mean they never thought our children should have so much money,

00:27:47.155 --> 00:27:49.875
crores and crores and crores.

00:27:49.875 --> 00:27:52.605
They never thought like that.

00:27:52.605 --> 00:27:58.615
Whatever limited money they had they wanted to donate

00:27:58.615 --> 00:28:01.505
and do something good for others.

00:28:01.505 --> 00:28:08.015
So when the Rajalakshmi, Lakshmi that is the one responsible

00:28:08.015 --> 00:28:12.735
for looking after the benevolence of the people,

00:28:12.735 --> 00:28:18.965
when She acts people think that they have,

00:28:18.965 --> 00:28:22.455
not even think, they do it, automatically,

00:28:22.455 --> 00:28:27.025
that they are there for benevolence.

00:28:27.025 --> 00:28:30.035
They don’t have to tell themselves,

00:28:30.035 --> 00:28:35.845
it’s just that they feel that it is their job,

00:28:35.845 --> 00:28:39.645
this is what they have to do, is to look after the people

00:28:39.645 --> 00:28:44.695
they are to be brought to better levels of life.

00:28:44.695 --> 00:28:51.265
This is what they think, they don’t think like a party politics,

00:28:51.265 --> 00:29:01.345
who is coming up, whom to kill, nothing of the kind!

00:29:01.345 --> 00:29:05.195
Under the influence of the Goddess of Lakshmi,

00:29:05.195 --> 00:29:15.175
which rules the political side we can say, the kingdoms and all that

00:29:15.175 --> 00:29:22.635
– first thing is generosity, first thing is generosity.

00:29:22.635 --> 00:29:30.535
For example, Mahavira was meditating and while coming out His cloth

00:29:30.535 --> 00:29:34.325
– He had one cloth around His body, dhoti and He had covered himself.

00:29:34.325 --> 00:29:42.745
And the upper cloth just got caught up in the bushes.

00:29:42.745 --> 00:29:45.135
So he cut it out and came out with half the cloth

00:29:45.135 --> 00:29:47.925
– it was in His own palace.

00:29:47.925 --> 00:29:53.095
So Shri Krishna wanted to take His test.

00:29:53.095 --> 00:29:57.985
He said, “See I have no clothes, I’m just naked.”

00:29:57.985 --> 00:30:01.615
He came before Him like a beggar.

00:30:01.615 --> 00:30:05.215
“You have this, why don’t you give Me this cloth?

00:30:05.215 --> 00:30:08.305
You can go to your palace and wear your dress.”

00:30:08.305 --> 00:30:09.525
He said, “Alright.”

00:30:09.525 --> 00:30:16.235
He took it out and gave it to him.

00:30:16.235 --> 00:30:20.045
And then He got some leaves and all that, covered Himself,

00:30:20.045 --> 00:30:22.035
went to His palace and got dressed.

00:30:22.035 --> 00:30:29.115
But now these Jains, you know, they make His statue so big,

00:30:29.115 --> 00:30:30.985
insult Him completely

00:30:30.985 --> 00:30:44.855
by showing all kinds of nonsensical private parts to the details.

00:30:44.855 --> 00:30:53.934
This is what is, where you have no worshipping of the Goddess.

00:30:53.934 --> 00:30:56.345
Goddess is Shri Shobha!

00:30:56.345 --> 00:31:01.175
She’s the One who decorates you.

00:31:01.175 --> 00:31:04.575
She’s a mother.

00:31:04.575 --> 00:31:06.165
She decorates you with ornaments,

00:31:06.165 --> 00:31:09.215
She decorates you with beautiful clothes, She’s your mother.

00:31:09.215 --> 00:31:12.395
She does it!

00:31:12.395 --> 00:31:19.665
Like, Raja Janaka, He was the king so

00:31:19.665 --> 00:31:27.804
He had to wear ornaments, He had to wear beautiful clothes,

00:31:27.804 --> 00:31:29.355
He had to do everything.

00:31:29.355 --> 00:31:30.355
And when Nachiketa went to Him

00:31:30.355 --> 00:31:34.635
he was quite surprised that why my guru has sent him to this king

00:31:34.635 --> 00:31:38.005
who is wearing all kind of dresses and this and that and

00:31:38.005 --> 00:31:41.755
he also had a big function of dancing and this.

00:31:41.755 --> 00:31:47.585
He said, “He’s not a saint so why my guru touches His feet?

00:31:47.585 --> 00:31:52.515
He’s a king.”

00:31:52.515 --> 00:32:00.395
Of course Raja Janaka knew what he was thinking about.

00:32:00.395 --> 00:32:02.605
He said, “Why have you come here Nachiketa?”

00:32:02.605 --> 00:32:06.255
He said, “I’m here to get my Self-realisation.”

00:32:06.255 --> 00:32:10.615
He said, “You can take all My kingdom

00:32:10.615 --> 00:32:14.205
but not easy to give you Self-realisation.”

00:32:14.205 --> 00:32:21.215
He said, “Alright, whatever you say I’ll do.”

00:32:21.215 --> 00:32:29.355
So He put a big sword on his head and asked him to sleep.

00:32:29.355 --> 00:32:35.285
He couldn’t sleep at all.

00:32:35.285 --> 00:32:36.745
Then they were having a bath,

00:32:36.745 --> 00:32:39.425
he said, “Come and have bath in the river.”

00:32:39.425 --> 00:32:45.745
People came and told that there’s fire and everybody’s running away

00:32:45.745 --> 00:32:47.835
and Raja Janaka was in His meditative mood,

00:32:47.835 --> 00:32:50.535
He was just sitting quietly.

00:32:50.535 --> 00:32:53.235
Nachiketa got a little upset.

00:32:53.235 --> 00:32:55.545
Then they said, “The fire is coming here

00:32:55.545 --> 00:32:58.314
and all these cloths are going to be burnt.”

00:32:58.314 --> 00:33:08.645
So Nachiketa ran out to save his things but still He was meditating.

00:33:08.645 --> 00:33:13.465
Then they came out and Nachiketa found

00:33:13.465 --> 00:33:16.934
that nothing that was burnt was there.

00:33:16.934 --> 00:33:20.865
It was just an illusion for people.

00:33:20.865 --> 00:33:25.895
He was amazed.

00:33:25.895 --> 00:33:30.434
Then he realised what was wrong with him,

00:33:30.434 --> 00:33:36.285
that he was doubting the Divine power Itself.

00:33:36.285 --> 00:33:41.545
The one who was Janaka, who was a king,

00:33:41.545 --> 00:33:45.495
was not bothered about His own powers, these are what?

00:33:45.495 --> 00:33:48.525
Because he is today, this you have to do it.

00:33:48.525 --> 00:33:52.975
Because I’m married, I have to wear a mangalsutra.

00:33:52.975 --> 00:33:57.795
So this is for the parampara, for the tradition style,

00:33:57.795 --> 00:34:13.755
but inside He was a saint, a very high…high level of saintliness.

00:34:13.755 --> 00:34:24.555
When this thing happens that you get some position,

00:34:24.555 --> 00:34:29.255
any power, even in Sahaja Yoga I was surprised.

00:34:29.255 --> 00:34:36.885
If somebody becomes leader, I don’t know what happens to him.

00:34:36.885 --> 00:34:37.885
It is a myth.

00:34:37.885 --> 00:34:40.735
There’s nothing like leadership in Sahaja Yoga, nothing like that.

00:34:40.735 --> 00:34:44.315
It’s just a myth.

00:34:44.315 --> 00:34:51.985
But suddenly people jump up.

00:34:51.985 --> 00:34:58.374
It is ego that gets pampered.

00:34:58.374 --> 00:35:07.885
But this ego can be easily managed if you worship the Rajalakshmi.

00:35:07.885 --> 00:35:11.495
She is the giver of balance.

00:35:11.495 --> 00:35:26.255
Firstly, She rides on the elephant.

00:35:26.255 --> 00:35:29.915
Is not easy for a lady to climb on an elephant,

00:35:29.915 --> 00:35:35.105
I have done it, it’s not easy.

00:35:35.105 --> 00:35:37.735
Without fear.

00:35:37.735 --> 00:35:50.855
And She sits straight with a complete balanced attitude.

00:35:50.855 --> 00:35:56.175
And Her blessings are tremendous.

00:35:56.175 --> 00:36:11.495
The first blessing one gets: the imbibement of dignity.

00:36:11.495 --> 00:36:16.955
Dignity of a king, dignity of a queen.

00:36:16.955 --> 00:36:25.475
You are a queen, so you can’t behave like street women.

00:36:25.475 --> 00:36:35.655
With Her blessing, first of all, you get that dignity.

00:36:35.655 --> 00:36:45.135
That dignity is full of love, love for others.

00:36:45.135 --> 00:36:47.525
That personality emits nothing

00:36:47.525 --> 00:36:54.585
but love and benevolence for others, nothing else.

00:36:54.585 --> 00:37:02.935
Wherever She looks, in every glance She blesses people.

00:37:02.935 --> 00:37:05.945
She doesn’t expect anything.

00:37:05.945 --> 00:37:11.315
She is a queen, what can you give to the queen?

00:37:11.315 --> 00:37:15.875
She’s the highest of all in every way,

00:37:15.875 --> 00:37:17.545
what can you give it to Her?

00:37:17.545 --> 00:37:21.805
These, all these politicians and all these so-called presidents

00:37:21.805 --> 00:37:23.025
of all these countries are beggars.

00:37:23.025 --> 00:37:30.165
All the time give me this, give me this,

00:37:30.165 --> 00:37:33.565
like greedy people going around are beggars!

00:37:33.565 --> 00:37:41.005
They are not the people who can rule.

00:37:41.005 --> 00:37:47.435
Hankering after things.

00:37:47.435 --> 00:37:54.055
So first thing is the sign, is that such a person has a personality

00:37:54.055 --> 00:38:01.124
that just blesses people, thinks of their benevolence,

00:38:01.124 --> 00:38:07.045
cares for each and every person who comes along.

00:38:07.045 --> 00:38:16.745
This is a blessing of the Goddess.

00:38:16.745 --> 00:38:21.085
Then the second blessing of the Goddess

00:38:21.085 --> 00:38:27.745
is that you develop a kind of a temperament,

00:38:27.745 --> 00:38:36.675
which is very dignified, but also very humorous

00:38:36.675 --> 00:38:42.815
and understanding what other people are like.

00:38:47.445 --> 00:38:53.055
There’s a story of a king who was going on a horse

00:38:53.055 --> 00:38:54.185
and he met a drunkard.

00:38:54.185 --> 00:38:56.535
So you can say

00:38:56.535 --> 00:39:01.275
these our drunkard can be compared to our politicians.

00:39:01.275 --> 00:39:04.775
So the drunkard stopped.

00:39:04.775 --> 00:39:08.665
He said, “I want to buy your horse.”

00:39:08.665 --> 00:39:11.265
People said, “Do you know what he is?”

00:39:11.265 --> 00:39:13.075
“Yeah I know he’s a king.

00:39:13.075 --> 00:39:14.075
Alright.

00:39:14.075 --> 00:39:15.075
So what?

00:39:15.075 --> 00:39:16.075
I want to buy his horse.”

00:39:16.075 --> 00:39:21.255
He said, “Alright not today, tomorrow we’ll sell the horse to you.”

00:39:21.255 --> 00:39:22.315
So went away.

00:39:22.315 --> 00:39:24.085
Next day he was called.

00:39:24.085 --> 00:39:28.065
So he came with folded hands bent down.

00:39:28.065 --> 00:39:33.245
He said, “What, you were the one who was going to buy my horse,

00:39:33.245 --> 00:39:34.945
what has happened to you?

00:39:34.945 --> 00:39:38.395
I want to sell it to you.”

00:39:38.395 --> 00:39:46.785
He said, “Sir, the one who wanted to buy is dead.

00:39:46.785 --> 00:39:49.515
I am an ordinary person.”

00:39:49.515 --> 00:40:10.655
Such a personality, such solid personality I should say,

00:40:10.655 --> 00:40:14.135
that anybody would have been angry, would have said

00:40:14.135 --> 00:40:15.175
“Beat this man!

00:40:15.175 --> 00:40:16.205
Throw him away!

00:40:16.205 --> 00:40:17.955
He talks to me like this,

00:40:17.955 --> 00:40:23.131
behaves like this.”

00:40:23.157 --> 00:40:28.787
What the king said was remarkable.

00:40:28.787 --> 00:40:37.676
Because he knew he’s drunk, he knew he’s not in his senses,

00:40:37.676 --> 00:40:42.597
that’s why he’s talking.

00:40:42.597 --> 00:40:44.557
Didn’t get angry with him,

00:40:44.557 --> 00:40:47.597
he said, “Alright, come along tomorrow, I’ll sell you the horse.”

00:40:47.597 --> 00:40:51.627
That’s only possible if you have this Rajalakshmi in you

00:40:51.627 --> 00:40:55.197
otherwise you would never behave like this.

00:40:55.197 --> 00:41:01.487
Now what about today’s politicians anywhere?

00:41:01.487 --> 00:41:05.477
They even shoot people, they kill people,

00:41:05.477 --> 00:41:07.767
they arrest them,they put them into trouble I mean,

00:41:07.767 --> 00:41:21.397
all kinds of things they are doing.

00:41:21.397 --> 00:41:28.717
Such people have no right to call anybody as criminals!

00:41:28.717 --> 00:41:31.437
But we accept!

00:41:31.437 --> 00:41:36.186
As in Hindi we say, “Aaj kal ka zamana hai aisa.”

00:41:36.186 --> 00:41:38.007
(Such is todays world)

00:41:38.007 --> 00:41:46.897
We accept it – all such people as our rulers.

00:41:46.897 --> 00:41:54.247
Then Rajalakshmi is the one who stands on dharma.

00:41:54.247 --> 00:41:56.277
She stands on dharma.

00:41:56.277 --> 00:42:08.697
If there is some adharmi then she will not bless that person.

00:42:08.697 --> 00:42:16.597
Adharmi is to be taken out.

00:42:16.597 --> 00:42:29.137
But if he’s not, then he will go all out to save that person.

00:42:29.137 --> 00:42:36.707
But if he finds he’s adharmi, he will not.

00:42:36.707 --> 00:42:44.097
Is a kind of a divine discretion he should have

00:42:44.097 --> 00:42:52.157
as to whom to be kind and whom to be punishing.

00:42:52.157 --> 00:42:58.307
That divine discretion should be there in a person,

00:42:58.307 --> 00:43:01.597
otherwise you can play into the hands of ten people

00:43:01.597 --> 00:43:12.487
who are around you, teaching you something, doing something.

00:43:12.487 --> 00:43:19.227
One day I was in My mother’s place Nandgaon,

00:43:19.227 --> 00:43:24.187
and there was one gentleman who impressed our Yogi very much.

00:43:24.187 --> 00:43:25.807
I just kept quiet.

00:43:25.807 --> 00:43:34.557
He was a big politician and he told Me,

00:43:34.557 --> 00:43:38.987
“We have to do like this and we have to do.”

00:43:38.987 --> 00:43:40.847
I said, “Alright, alright, alright.”

00:43:40.847 --> 00:43:46.957
Then three, four professors from the university came to tell Me,

00:43:46.957 --> 00:43:50.747
“Mother, he’s a politician, be very careful.

00:43:50.747 --> 00:43:54.367
He’s a very bad man, you be careful about him.”

00:43:54.367 --> 00:43:56.787
I said, “What do you know about him?”

00:43:56.787 --> 00:43:58.657
They said, “He’s a politician.”

00:43:58.657 --> 00:44:00.557
I said, “There are so many politicians.”

00:44:00.557 --> 00:44:02.177
“But he’s not a good man.”

00:44:02.177 --> 00:44:04.357
“But what do you mean?”

00:44:04.357 --> 00:44:07.077
I said, “Now you sit down and I’ll tell you.

00:44:07.077 --> 00:44:10.947
This man has eloped with the wife of a Brahmin.

00:44:10.947 --> 00:44:19.166
He himself is not a Brahmin and this child is from him to her

00:44:19.166 --> 00:44:24.577
and how much he has deceived people everything I know.”

00:44:24.577 --> 00:44:25.577
They were shocked.

00:44:25.577 --> 00:44:26.577
“You know Mother?”

00:44:26.577 --> 00:44:28.917
“Of course.

00:44:28.917 --> 00:44:32.937
I know everything!”

00:44:32.937 --> 00:44:43.247
“Then why do You allow him to come close to You?”

00:44:43.247 --> 00:44:46.777
“Do you think he is close to Me?”

00:44:46.777 --> 00:44:52.317
I said, “You are sadly mistaken.

00:44:52.317 --> 00:44:56.797
But it’s nice he’s come to Me

00:44:56.797 --> 00:45:01.457
because he’s been troubling people too much and I’ll correct him.”

00:45:01.457 --> 00:45:05.537
While some people thought he was a great achievement we have got,

00:45:05.537 --> 00:45:08.577
and some of them came to tell Me be careful of this man

00:45:08.577 --> 00:45:15.717
without knowing what he was.

00:45:15.717 --> 00:45:20.697
This kind of a divine discretion has to be there.

00:45:20.697 --> 00:45:24.757
If a king does not have that divine discretion

00:45:24.757 --> 00:45:37.657
then he can punish the good and he may help the bad people.

00:45:37.657 --> 00:45:41.727
But this divine discretion disappears when you are self-centred.

00:45:41.727 --> 00:45:45.597
That’s the main point, is a complete detachment

00:45:45.597 --> 00:45:49.186
about the power should be there.

00:45:49.186 --> 00:45:51.097
Complete detachment.

00:45:51.097 --> 00:45:54.347
Why should Rajalakshmi care for anything?

00:45:54.347 --> 00:45:59.627
What does She get?

00:45:59.627 --> 00:46:01.557
But now there are some who’ll pamper a person

00:46:01.557 --> 00:46:04.037
this, this and that, and then they feel

00:46:04.037 --> 00:46:10.277
“ah, we’re on top of the world!”

00:46:10.277 --> 00:46:14.097
They just pamper, pamper and pamper

00:46:14.097 --> 00:46:21.547
the ego of a politician and he thinks he is a very big man,

00:46:21.547 --> 00:46:29.577
then in the election he doesn’t understand why he’s on the ground.

00:46:29.577 --> 00:46:40.317
So with this self-dignity, self-knowledge, you know what you are.

00:46:40.317 --> 00:46:42.577
Whatever you may tell Me, whatever you may say to Me,

00:46:42.577 --> 00:46:46.527
I’ll listen, “Alright, alright, alright”,

00:46:46.527 --> 00:46:53.477
but I don’t accept anything as something great.

00:46:53.477 --> 00:46:59.887
Because if I am that, what is there to be great?

00:46:59.887 --> 00:47:05.597
Now supposing this is a lamp here.

00:47:05.597 --> 00:47:07.787
So is it great or not great?

00:47:07.787 --> 00:47:08.897
It is a lamp.

00:47:08.897 --> 00:47:22.197
So if I’m Adi Shakti, I’m Adi Shakti, So what?

00:47:22.197 --> 00:47:26.607
If you are a king you are a king so what?

00:47:26.607 --> 00:47:31.347
I mean if you are an impostor then you might feel your ego.

00:47:31.347 --> 00:47:37.807
But if you are really the king then you won’t feel.

00:47:37.807 --> 00:47:44.727
If you are under the influence of the Goddess

00:47:44.727 --> 00:47:50.037
then that is the only thing you enjoy.

00:47:50.037 --> 00:47:54.947
The rest of it is nothing.

00:47:54.947 --> 00:47:59.727
Whether you have diamonds or you have silver

00:47:59.727 --> 00:48:11.317
or you have anything makes no difference at all.

00:48:11.317 --> 00:48:17.027
Now how people misuse the scriptures also one should see.

00:48:17.027 --> 00:48:22.457
That, Rajalakshmi is sitting on the elephant alright,

00:48:22.457 --> 00:48:27.577
so they should have all very big cars, you see.

00:48:27.577 --> 00:48:33.477
She’s sitting on the elephant because elephant is the highest animal!

00:48:33.477 --> 00:48:40.897
Is very kind, very forgiving and has such a tremendous memory.

00:48:40.897 --> 00:48:47.967
That’s why She’s sitting on an elephant.

00:48:47.967 --> 00:48:54.877
She’s not sitting there to show off.

00:48:54.877 --> 00:49:01.357
But She’s sitting there to see around, what is happening

00:49:01.357 --> 00:49:10.007
avalokan, She can see around what is happening, to be at a higher place.

00:49:10.007 --> 00:49:19.676
That’s why a king is made to sit on a higher pedestal.

00:49:19.676 --> 00:49:23.617
But the purpose is not to show off.

00:49:23.617 --> 00:49:26.676
But the purpose is

00:49:26.676 --> 00:49:33.156
that from that state he can see others better,

00:49:33.156 --> 00:49:43.176
he can be watchful of others.

00:49:43.176 --> 00:49:45.487
If somebody gets a high position

00:49:45.487 --> 00:49:55.817
then they think they are the owners of that position.

00:49:55.817 --> 00:50:07.037
This has all come because the brain has gone upside down I think.

00:50:07.037 --> 00:50:11.147
How can it be?

00:50:11.147 --> 00:50:13.067
Logically?

00:50:13.067 --> 00:50:20.936
Now if you are this throne is given, alright, so with the throne

00:50:20.936 --> 00:50:29.287
I sit on this, but this throne cannot give Me anything,

00:50:29.287 --> 00:50:35.117
I can give something to this throne.

00:50:35.117 --> 00:50:39.397
The king has to think he is obliging all these things th

00:50:39.397 --> 00:50:44.117
at he is sitting on them because he is a king.

00:50:44.117 --> 00:50:49.057
On the contrary he thinks all these things are important because something is lacking

00:50:49.057 --> 00:50:53.387
in him or what?

00:50:53.387 --> 00:50:57.357
And that’s why when they come to do Raj

00:50:57.357 --> 00:51:02.457
they start gathering things which are useless absolutely,

00:51:02.457 --> 00:51:09.947
clutter up their houses, homes, everything with something that is useless.

00:51:09.947 --> 00:51:18.197
All their dignity, everything, is itself a decoration on them

00:51:18.197 --> 00:51:20.176
and to show that they are kings.

00:51:20.176 --> 00:51:22.507
Of course they are given a crown,

00:51:22.507 --> 00:51:28.847
they are given a big necklace, they are to wear something here

00:51:28.847 --> 00:51:29.847
because they are kings.

00:51:29.847 --> 00:51:39.597
But these are not actually his decorations

00:51:39.597 --> 00:51:46.257
but these things get decorated by a king.

00:51:46.257 --> 00:51:51.977
For example, you get some lanky panky fellow from the street,

00:51:51.977 --> 00:51:58.327
half starved, who is a beggar, say, for example,

00:51:58.327 --> 00:52:05.887
and put those ornaments on him and all the dresses of a king.

00:52:05.887 --> 00:52:11.527
Put him on the stage, everybody may start laughing.

00:52:11.527 --> 00:52:17.837
Nobody will think that he is a king by any chance,

00:52:17.837 --> 00:52:21.037
because he doesn’t have that dignity, doesn’t have that face,

00:52:21.037 --> 00:52:23.457
he doesn’t have that body, he doesn’t have that mind,

00:52:23.457 --> 00:52:26.447
he doesn’t have that wisdom.

00:52:26.447 --> 00:52:30.337
So how is he a king?

00:52:30.337 --> 00:52:37.686
Like, there was one king who tried to make his shoes of pearls.

00:52:37.686 --> 00:52:40.257
But he’s so stupid looking, you know,

00:52:40.257 --> 00:52:44.297
that when I saw the pearls I said,

00:52:44.297 --> 00:52:49.577
“This is the man only who can think like this!”

00:52:49.577 --> 00:52:52.697
So stupid he was to look at.

00:52:52.697 --> 00:53:00.207
And was sure of these pearls being put on his shoes.

00:53:00.207 --> 00:53:06.377
So there are many such things these days all of these stupid people are doing.

00:53:06.377 --> 00:53:09.967
There are big, big cartoons coming out

00:53:09.967 --> 00:53:15.947
and you can see for yourself how stupidly they live.

00:53:15.947 --> 00:53:22.207
To Me it’s such a difference I tell you.

00:53:22.207 --> 00:53:23.337
Such a difference.

00:53:23.337 --> 00:53:27.167
To them all these things are so important,

00:53:27.167 --> 00:53:34.547
which if they don’t have they’ll buy and put it.

00:53:34.547 --> 00:53:43.757
I know of a gentleman who came with a garland to our program,

00:53:43.757 --> 00:53:52.237
I mean to our dinner, I asked him, “Why are you carrying the garland?”

00:53:52.237 --> 00:53:57.587
“See after all you see I was garlanded so I’m keeping the garland.”

00:53:57.587 --> 00:54:01.667
We didn’t know what to do!

00:54:01.667 --> 00:54:03.287
We Indians will never take a garland,

00:54:03.287 --> 00:54:07.227
first of all, anybody gives you they’ll put it, except for the Gods.

00:54:07.227 --> 00:54:10.807
They will take it out immediately.

00:54:10.807 --> 00:54:13.417
Another lady who came to see Me and she said,

00:54:13.417 --> 00:54:15.217
“I don’t understand these Indians,

00:54:15.217 --> 00:54:18.057
I bought a garland, I put it in my neck

00:54:18.057 --> 00:54:23.407
so they were all laughing on the street at me.”

00:54:23.407 --> 00:54:30.137
Now you Indians understand this, how subtle it is, just see,

00:54:30.137 --> 00:54:33.687
that you can’t put garland, you are not God.

00:54:33.687 --> 00:54:38.467
You cannot buy a garland (laughing) and put it in your neck and walk out.

00:54:38.467 --> 00:54:44.797
Innately you have to be that.

00:54:44.797 --> 00:54:55.406
So the person who is innately a king has the blessings of the Rajalakshmi.

00:54:55.406 --> 00:54:58.307
Then what does She do?

00:54:58.307 --> 00:55:01.247
What does She do to such a man?

00:55:01.247 --> 00:55:05.847
What She does is first

00:55:05.847 --> 00:55:13.697
his name is written on the hearts of the people whom he rules.

00:55:13.697 --> 00:55:22.217
She writes it with her own hand.

00:55:22.217 --> 00:55:24.797
They adore him,

00:55:24.797 --> 00:55:36.167
they admire him and they try to imbibe his qualities within himself.

00:55:36.167 --> 00:55:43.537
Another blessing of Rajalakshmi is

00:55:43.537 --> 00:55:53.467
that She grants a particular type of a body,

00:55:53.467 --> 00:56:01.656
which has a coefficience, which gives vibrations.

00:56:01.656 --> 00:56:09.647
They may not be very selfish people

00:56:09.647 --> 00:56:13.227
to make a big advertisement about themselves,

00:56:13.227 --> 00:56:16.497
talking about themselves, this that.

00:56:16.497 --> 00:56:25.227
But the way they are wherever they are, they show.

00:56:25.227 --> 00:56:33.436
We had many like these in our times also.

00:56:33.436 --> 00:56:38.916
Maybe that people didn’t accept them, maybe they are nowhere now,

00:56:38.916 --> 00:56:44.527
some new johnnies are looking to be more jumping.

00:56:44.527 --> 00:56:49.797
But whatever name is written in the heart of the people,

00:56:49.797 --> 00:56:54.906
are the people who are blessed by this Rajalakshmi.

00:56:54.906 --> 00:56:58.297
So what a politician has to understand [is]

00:56:58.297 --> 00:57:03.887
that he has not to make money,

00:57:03.887 --> 00:57:13.477
he does not have to have a big show about himself.

00:57:13.477 --> 00:57:20.247
He does not have to do anything that is like

00:57:20.247 --> 00:57:24.577
laundering the money from the country.

00:57:24.577 --> 00:57:27.608
He does not have to kill others who oppose him,

00:57:27.608 --> 00:57:31.827
he doesn’t have to shout at those who trouble them.

00:57:31.827 --> 00:57:33.757
But what has he to do?

00:57:33.757 --> 00:57:36.177
He has to remember that.

00:57:36.177 --> 00:57:44.817
“I am here for the fame of a good man.”

00:57:44.817 --> 00:57:52.367
He should worry about the fame he will be leaving after his death.

00:57:52.367 --> 00:57:56.247
He should see to it that his fame is safe.

00:57:56.247 --> 00:58:08.676
For example, see Shri Rama who was a king of benevolence, no doubt about it.

00:58:08.676 --> 00:58:14.787
But His own wife when somebody challenged that

00:58:14.787 --> 00:58:19.527
– “She has lived with Ravana and how can She be pure?”

00:58:19.527 --> 00:58:25.737
He knew that She was pure, still He decided that He will ask Her to go

00:58:25.737 --> 00:58:35.747
because to keep the show, to keep the whole image of a king

00:58:35.747 --> 00:58:41.137
and He sent Her away.

00:58:41.137 --> 00:58:47.077
But nowadays you find somebody’s brother employed in America,

00:58:47.077 --> 00:58:52.957
sister employed there and he has made, his uncle has made a big house

00:58:52.957 --> 00:58:55.807
and his wife has accumulated so much money.

00:58:55.807 --> 00:59:01.807
It is all going on.

00:59:01.807 --> 00:59:04.877
Everybody will talk like that about that person,

00:59:04.877 --> 00:59:07.477
that he’s just money oriented,

00:59:07.477 --> 00:59:12.507
he just spends money on nonsensical things and he is just exploiting us.

00:59:12.507 --> 00:59:19.927
Everybody will talk but nobody will tell him on the face.

00:59:19.927 --> 00:59:25.156
So what you have to worry is about absolute correct character.

00:59:25.156 --> 00:59:31.127
These days this is another point.

00:59:31.127 --> 00:59:32.127
Every politician

00:59:32.127 --> 00:59:33.918
must have three, four keeps otherwise he is not a politician.

00:59:33.918 --> 00:59:39.377
Like we had Nawabs, we had one Nawab in Lucknow

00:59:39.377 --> 00:59:40.607
who had hundred and sixty five wives.

00:59:40.607 --> 00:59:45.227
He thought if he doesn’t have hundred and sixty five,

00:59:45.227 --> 00:59:50.887
people won’t accept him as a Nawab.

00:59:50.887 --> 00:59:54.957
So this is another inferiority complex

00:59:54.957 --> 00:59:57.847
that you should have some women around you

00:59:57.847 --> 01:00:06.477
so that people will say what a powerful man he is.

01:00:06.477 --> 01:00:14.847
Now those days are gone now, now Satya Yuga has started.

01:00:14.847 --> 01:00:24.127
In Satya Yuga I assure you anybody who is not blessed by Rajalakshmi

01:00:24.127 --> 01:00:33.597
will have to go to jail or will have to leave the seat,

01:00:33.597 --> 01:00:39.037
will be thrown away or will be as they say,

01:00:39.037 --> 01:00:41.577
“Doubly dying go to the waste, dust”.

01:00:41.577 --> 01:00:44.567
It has to be.

01:00:44.567 --> 01:00:51.327
They’ll be all exposed, whatever tricks they may try.

01:00:51.327 --> 01:01:04.117
And they will have the consequence of being artificially the rulers.

01:01:04.117 --> 01:01:16.487
But a genuineness is the sign that the queen of blessings,

01:01:16.487 --> 01:01:24.817
the goddess of Rajalakshmi, is residing in that person.

01:01:24.817 --> 01:01:34.887
In Satya Yuga it will happen I’m sure.

01:01:34.887 --> 01:01:39.417
But even in Sahaja Yoga I find people doing politics sometimes,

01:01:39.417 --> 01:01:42.317
I was amazed!

01:01:42.317 --> 01:01:47.847
People think politics means keeping groups,

01:01:47.847 --> 01:01:53.747
making groups, telling things from here to there, there to there.

01:01:53.747 --> 01:01:56.277
That shows you lack collectivity.

01:01:56.277 --> 01:02:07.277
A person who is a Sahaja Yogi will try to cement everyone together

01:02:07.277 --> 01:02:13.847
because the power lies in collectivity.

01:02:13.847 --> 01:02:19.136
To break the collectivity for anything

01:02:19.136 --> 01:02:28.107
is very dangerous for that person as well as for others.

01:02:28.107 --> 01:02:33.517
So now you have entered into the kingdom of God,

01:02:33.517 --> 01:02:39.707
you are now sitting in the court of God Almighty.

01:02:39.707 --> 01:02:47.666
Here, of course, as courtiers you have to dress up well,

01:02:47.666 --> 01:02:52.737
sit properly, should take up your seats.

01:02:52.737 --> 01:02:55.587
You have to be systematic

01:02:55.587 --> 01:03:00.347
and above board because you are Sahaja Yogis.

01:03:00.347 --> 01:03:04.147
You are not ordinary people.

01:03:04.147 --> 01:03:06.167
You are special people.

01:03:06.167 --> 01:03:13.027
How many people in this world are going to be Sahaja Yogi?

01:03:13.027 --> 01:03:16.416
You are special people,

01:03:16.416 --> 01:03:27.247
so try to make yourself such beautiful instruments of Rajalakshmi

01:03:27.247 --> 01:03:32.117
that people when they will see you they will vote for you

01:03:32.117 --> 01:03:45.357
and tomorrow you will rule the world.

01:03:45.357 --> 01:03:50.477
I do not want you to get out of politics or get in politics

01:03:50.477 --> 01:03:56.337
but you have to first get the blessings of the Rajalakshmi

01:03:56.337 --> 01:03:58.857
and then only you should understand

01:03:58.857 --> 01:04:03.087
what’s wrong with our country, what we have to do,

01:04:03.087 --> 01:04:10.567
what is the purpose, why do we want to become politicians,

01:04:10.567 --> 01:04:16.267
what we have to do, we have to have plans, what is your project.

01:04:16.267 --> 01:04:22.407
All these things now put your attention from yourself to outside.

01:04:22.407 --> 01:04:26.187
Like, that day I received a letter saying,

01:04:26.187 --> 01:04:30.477
“my father is sick and my mother is sick then my son is sick,

01:04:30.477 --> 01:04:33.387
and this and that and that and that.”

01:04:33.387 --> 01:04:38.577
Such people can’t do much.

01:04:38.577 --> 01:04:40.517
When the war of independence started in India

01:04:40.517 --> 01:04:43.666
we gave up our studies, gave up our parents, gave up everything,

01:04:43.666 --> 01:04:46.527
we were very young people.

01:04:46.527 --> 01:04:47.677
So now you have to know

01:04:47.677 --> 01:04:53.977
that if you have to really take to politics

01:04:53.977 --> 01:04:56.337
you have to have the blessings of Rajalakshmi

01:04:56.337 --> 01:05:00.807
and for that you have to build up yourself

01:05:00.807 --> 01:05:05.207
with that dignity, with that sense.

01:05:07.696 --> 01:05:12.926
I bless you from My heart that in every country such

01:05:12.967 --> 01:05:15.427
people will come up.

01:05:16.326 --> 01:05:18.826
May God bless you
