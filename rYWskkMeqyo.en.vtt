00:08.510 --> 00:13.896
The whole behaviour has to be understood

00:14.097 --> 00:20.189
that you have become a subtler person and you are rising higher,

00:20.390 --> 00:25.392
so naturally the negative forces are going to attack you.

00:25.593 --> 00:31.550
Always the front line is under attack, not the back line.

00:31.751 --> 00:37.238
So those who are in the front are always under attack

00:37.439 --> 00:42.116
and they have to be very careful as to how they are behaving.

00:42.317 --> 00:48.139
For if there is a sly person, he will become sly, but subtler sly.

00:48.340 --> 00:53.249
He will not just become the other way round, his slyness will become subtler.

00:53.450 --> 01:00.302
If he is a miserly fellow, then he will become miserly in a subtler way.

01:00.503 --> 01:02.687
Or say, if he is an ego-oriented fellow,

01:02.888 --> 01:06.150
then he becomes ego-oriented in a subtler way.

01:06.351 --> 01:15.234
But to get rid of these things within you,
you have to go to the other side of it.

01:15.315 --> 01:17.830
Say if you are miserly, you become absolutely generous;

01:17.911 --> 01:21.515
give up everything that you have.

01:21.716 --> 01:28.326
Don’t be calculated, don’t talk of money, don’t worry about money.

01:29.072 --> 01:35.522
If you are extravagant, indulgent too much, you should go the other way round.

01:35.723 --> 01:41.680
Unless and until you become juxtaposition, you cannot get rid of these things.

01:41.881 --> 01:45.636
Like if you are hot-tempered man, very hot-tempered, then become so mild

01:45.837 --> 01:49.617
that even if somebody beats you, it’s all right.

01:49.818 --> 01:51.636
Whatever one says it’s all right.

01:51.837 --> 01:57.540
That’s how you get rid of your habits which become subtler and subtler.

01:59.100 --> 02:07.060
There’s another way of dealing with it: being alert.

02:07.614 --> 02:09.814
When you are alert, you start seeing yourself

02:09.928 --> 02:13.111
as a separate person with the habits that it has,

02:13.192 --> 02:15.711
and then you start understanding why you are behaving,

02:15.792 --> 02:19.299
“Oh, I understand, I knew you before, ten years back,

02:19.500 --> 02:23.153
before my realisation. I know Mr., you are like this.”

02:23.354 --> 02:32.138
And then take the juxtaposition against that personality and just shoot it off.

02:32.339 --> 02:35.912
Like a person who is a negative, left-sided person,

02:35.993 --> 02:39.441
whatever you may do for that person, he will become subtler and subtler.

02:39.522 --> 02:44.593
Suddenly, if it’s a girl, she will start just crying for nothing at all

02:44.794 --> 02:48.977
and feeling miserable. If it’s a boy, if he thinks about, analyses

02:49.178 --> 02:56.354
he will become analyser of Sahaja Yoga also, in a subtler way.

02:56.435 --> 02:59.089
Then what they should do is to stand before the photograph

02:59.170 --> 03:03.894
and see the reflection, “That’s the other one who died.”

03:04.095 --> 03:12.770
And just try to make fun of that or shout at it, depends on.

03:13.071 --> 03:18.631
If it is an aggressive stuff, it’s better to make fun, because it’s stupid.

03:18.848 --> 03:23.121
And if it is that one that takes aggression, then shout at it,

03:23.322 --> 03:27.124
“What do you mean, by taking aggression like this?”

03:27.325 --> 03:32.757
All these things, you see, are keeping you away from reality.

03:32.958 --> 03:38.684
Your being has to be cleansed. With your help only I can do it.

03:38.765 --> 03:41.046
Many people say, “Mother, You are all-powerful.”

03:41.127 --> 03:44.516
All right, I am and I can do everything.

03:44.717 --> 03:48.590
But only thing I cannot surpass your freedom.

03:48.791 --> 03:55.177
That’s a fact, I cannot cross over your freedom.

03:55.677 --> 04:02.200
And when I cannot cross your freedom, you have to cross that.

04:03.340 --> 04:05.942
If in your own freedom, you come inside,

04:06.143 --> 04:08.927
then I will bestow upon you all the blessings.
