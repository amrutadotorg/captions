00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.896
The whole behaviour has to be understood

00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:20.189
that you have become a subtler person and you are rising higher,

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.392
so naturally the negative forces are going to attack you.

00:00:25.593 --> 00:00:31.550
Always the front line is under attack, not the back line.

00:00:31.751 --> 00:00:37.238
So those who are in the front are always under attack

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:42.116
and they have to be very careful as to how they are behaving.

00:00:42.317 --> 00:00:48.139
For if there is a sly person, he will become sly, but subtler sly.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.249
He will not just become the other way round, his slyness will become subtler.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:00.302
If he is a miserly fellow, then he will become miserly in a subtler way.

00:01:00.503 --> 00:01:02.687
Or say, if he is an ego-oriented fellow,

00:01:02.888 --> 00:01:06.150
then he becomes ego-oriented in a subtler way.

00:01:06.351 --> 00:01:15.234
But to get rid of these things within you, 
you have to go to the other side of it.

00:01:15.315 --> 00:01:17.830
Say if you are miserly, you become absolutely generous;

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:21.515
give up everything that you have.

00:01:21.716 --> 00:01:28.326
Don’t be calculated, don’t talk of money, don’t worry about money.

00:01:29.072 --> 00:01:35.522
If you are extravagant, indulgent too much, you should go the other way round.

00:01:35.723 --> 00:01:41.680
Unless and until you become juxtaposition, you cannot get rid of these things.

00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:45.636
Like if you are hot-tempered man, very hot-tempered, then become so mild

00:01:45.837 --> 00:01:49.617
that even if somebody beats you, it’s all right.

00:01:49.818 --> 00:01:51.636
Whatever one says it’s all right.

00:01:51.837 --> 00:01:57.540
That’s how you get rid of your habits which become subtler and subtler.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:07.060
There’s another way of dealing with it: being alert.

00:02:07.614 --> 00:02:09.814
When you are alert, you start seeing yourself

00:02:09.928 --> 00:02:13.111
as a separate person with the habits that it has,

00:02:13.192 --> 00:02:15.711
and then you start understanding why you are behaving,

00:02:15.792 --> 00:02:19.299
“Oh, I understand, I knew you before, ten years back,

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.153
before my realisation. I know Mr., you are like this.”

00:02:23.354 --> 00:02:32.138
And then take the juxtaposition against that personality and just shoot it off.

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:35.912
Like a person who is a negative, left-sided person,

00:02:35.993 --> 00:02:39.441
whatever you may do for that person, he will become subtler and subtler.

00:02:39.522 --> 00:02:44.593
Suddenly, if it’s a girl, she will start just crying for nothing at all

00:02:44.794 --> 00:02:48.977
and feeling miserable. If it’s a boy, if he thinks about, analyses

00:02:49.178 --> 00:02:56.354
he will become analyser of Sahaja Yoga also, in a subtler way.

00:02:56.435 --> 00:02:59.089
Then what they should do is to stand before the photograph

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.894
and see the reflection, “That’s the other one who died.”

00:03:04.095 --> 00:03:12.770
And just try to make fun of that or shout at it, depends on.

00:03:13.071 --> 00:03:18.631
If it is an aggressive stuff, it’s better to make fun, because it’s stupid.

00:03:18.848 --> 00:03:23.121
And if it is that one that takes aggression, then shout at it,

00:03:23.322 --> 00:03:27.124
“What do you mean, by taking aggression like this?”

00:03:27.325 --> 00:03:32.757
All these things, you see, are keeping you away from reality.

00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:38.684
Your being has to be cleansed. With your help only I can do it.

00:03:38.765 --> 00:03:41.046
Many people say, “Mother, You are all-powerful.”

00:03:41.127 --> 00:03:44.516
All right, I am and I can do everything.

00:03:44.717 --> 00:03:48.590
But only thing I cannot surpass your freedom.

00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:55.177
That’s a fact, I cannot cross over your freedom.

00:03:55.677 --> 00:04:02.200
And when I cannot cross your freedom, you have to cross that.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.942
If in your own freedom, you come inside,

00:04:06.143 --> 00:04:08.927
then I will bestow upon you all the blessings.
