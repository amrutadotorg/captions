1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,614
So here, what happens that when the kundalini
rises, when she goes to the Agnya Chakra

2
00:00:11,695 --> 00:00:16,800
which represents, as you say, the third eye or
whatever you may call it

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,413
it is between the optic chiasma, and it looks after the
pituitary and the pineal body.

4
00:00:23,493 --> 00:00:31,039
And as a result we have developed two institutions
called ego and superego.

5
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,675
The ego is the one which tells
us “I have done it. I am doing this.”

6
00:00:35,755 --> 00:00:42,769
Both these institutions are sucked
in by the enlightenment of this center

7
00:00:42,849 --> 00:00:48,377
and that’s how the thing opens out,
and all your karmas are sucked in.

8
00:00:48,457 --> 00:00:50,507
So there’s no problem of karmas.

9
00:00:50,588 --> 00:00:54,800
Only human beings think that they
are doing karmas; animals don’t.

10
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,215
They have no sense of sin or anything.

11
00:00:58,295 --> 00:01:01,520
They are completely under the bondage of God,

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,920
so in Sanskrit they are called as “pashu”, means “under the bondage.”

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,501
But we are the ones, we have got freedom.

14
00:01:07,581 --> 00:01:11,161
And that’s why we think we have done this and we have
done that;

15
00:01:11,241 --> 00:01:13,960
and we should not do this, we should not do that.

16
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:18,594
But when the kundalini rises and she awakens this center,

17
00:01:18,674 --> 00:01:21,615
then both these things are sucked in.

18
00:01:21,695 --> 00:01:23,803
And when they are sucked in,

19
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:28,948
then you do not do any karmas
anymore, you just are in akarma.

20
00:01:29,028 --> 00:01:35,460
You do everything – I mean, I travel, you know,
such a lot and I have a family, and everything is there;

21
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:41,490
but is just happening, I am just seeing
it, I am not doing anything as such.

22
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:48,319
So when you are also awakened,
there’s no obligation, it’s just happening.

23
00:01:48,406 --> 00:01:55,452
It is here where we should understand that this center

24
00:01:55,532 --> 00:02:00,940
is bestowed upon by the great life of Christ.

25
00:02:01,026 --> 00:02:07,887
Christ is there, and they said that He died
for our sins, died for our karmas – is a fact.

26
00:02:07,967 --> 00:02:14,033
Because when He is awakened
these two institutions are pulled in inside,

27
00:02:14,114 --> 00:02:18,877
and you get your kundalini out there – it opens out.

28
00:02:18,957 --> 00:02:23,278
And this bone which had been calcified opens out,

29
00:02:23,358 --> 00:02:26,666
and the kundalini pierces through.

30
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:30,057
And this is what it is, that He died for our sins,

31
00:02:30,137 --> 00:02:36,222
but still the theory is extended that we
must suffer.

32
00:02:36,302 --> 00:02:39,034
Why should we suffer? He has suffered for us already.

33
00:02:39,114 --> 00:02:43,240
And is already written by Thomas, who was travelling to India via

34
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,749
Egypt where he wrote the treatise, and he said that

35
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:51,563
“Why should we suffer? Christ has already suffered for us.”

36
00:02:51,643 --> 00:02:57,802
And he’s talked everything about Sahaja Yoga; he said
it is an experience of Self-realization, and everything.

37
00:02:57,882 --> 00:03:00,679
And that book now is out in England.

38
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,584
After forty-eight years they could decode the whole thing,

39
00:03:05,664 --> 00:03:08,581
which was found about forty-eight years back in Egypt

40
00:03:08,661 --> 00:03:13,797
and is out now, and is beautiful –
“Gnostics” is the name of the book.

41
00:03:13,877 --> 00:03:20,279
But is not so much appreciated by some
of the people, because this challenges

42
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:28,132
the theories of sufferings and confessions and all this nonsense.

43
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:44,936
[Inaudible question]

44
00:03:45,496 --> 00:03:52,801
Me, or you? You cannot awaken yourself.

45
00:03:52,900 --> 00:04:00,162
You see, you have to have one enlightened
candle to enlighten another candle.

46
00:04:00,242 --> 00:04:05,393
This candle which is not enlightened cannot enlighten itself.

47
00:04:05,473 --> 00:04:08,646
But there’s no obligation.

48
00:04:08,726 --> 00:04:14,836
But you can correct: once it is awakened
you can correct it, you can develop it.

49
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:24,962
First only few hair-like strands of this energy
come up and open the fontanel bone area,

50
00:04:25,048 --> 00:04:32,093
and then this flow of ruh starts flowing on you

51
00:04:32,185 --> 00:04:39,128
and it relaxes more of the centers, so more of these strands
start coming up.

52
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:45,120
So you can develop it at your will, by understanding
it,

53
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,639
but you cannot enlighten yourself by yourself.

54
00:04:51,369 --> 00:04:54,809
Now one thing is there obstructing Sahasrara

55
00:04:54,890 --> 00:05:00,850
is the movement of your Agnya into thoughts.

56
00:05:00,931 --> 00:05:04,774
That’s the only thing, that’s the only thing

57
00:05:04,855 --> 00:05:08,114
that stops your entry into Sahaja Yoga.

58
00:05:08,195 --> 00:05:12,328
Thoughts are coming all the time,

59
00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:16,688
because a human being is born who reacts to everything,

60
00:05:16,769 --> 00:05:21,750
react to this and react to that and the thoughts come in and the thoughts go.

61
00:05:21,831 --> 00:05:23,831
There’s a big crowd of thoughts.

62
00:05:23,962 --> 00:05:27,908
Because of that your attention cannot cross over Agnya

63
00:05:27,989 --> 00:05:32,229
and can reside in the Sahasrara.

64
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:37,350
So first of all, one should see what sort of thoughts are coming.

65
00:05:37,475 --> 00:05:40,191
You have to condemn yourself sometimes.

66
00:05:40,272 --> 00:05:43,563
You have to say: “What nonsense! What have I been doing?

67
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:47,765
What’s the matter with me? How could I do all that?”

68
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:52,408
Once you start doing that, these thoughts will start disappearing.

69
00:05:52,489 --> 00:05:55,289
These thoughts are coming from two angles,

70
00:05:55,369 --> 00:05:58,756
one from the ego and another from your conditionings.

71
00:05:58,837 --> 00:06:02,541
And these are so much built up within you,

72
00:06:02,622 --> 00:06:07,540
that they don’t allow your agnya to be crossed.

73
00:06:07,621 --> 00:06:11,902
That’s why we have two Bija mantras of ‘Hum’, ‘Kshum’.

74
00:06:11,983 --> 00:06:14,524
First one is, when it is conditioning,

75
00:06:14,605 --> 00:06:17,329
you are endowed with this kind of a fear,

76
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:20,118
“I shouldn’t do like this, I shouldn’t do like that,

77
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:23,408
it’s not allowed, that is not allowed.”

78
00:06:23,489 --> 00:06:25,409
That’s the conditioning part of it.

79
00:06:25,489 --> 00:06:27,496
Conditioning can be of many types.

80
00:06:27,577 --> 00:06:29,289
But the ego part of it is that,

81
00:06:29,369 --> 00:06:32,208
“I must overpower everybody, I must get this,

82
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:36,461
I must be able to rule everyone.”

83
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:40,164
These two things are there in the mind

84
00:06:40,245 --> 00:06:43,285
which are all the time crossing over.

85
00:06:44,135 --> 00:06:49,175
So it’s important that we should go into thoughtless awareness

86
00:06:49,608 --> 00:06:54,408
and that thoughtless awareness is the real way

87
00:06:54,489 --> 00:07:00,104
that your Sahasrara can be nourished by the Kundalini.

88
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:05,228
Because Kundalini cannot go through, it cannot pass through.

89
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:09,091
And for that, as I said, there are two Bija mantras,

90
00:07:09,172 --> 00:07:11,409
one is ‘Hum’ another ’Kshum’.

91
00:07:11,489 --> 00:07:14,409
So, if you are conditioned, you are frightened,

92
00:07:14,489 --> 00:07:17,962
you are afraid and you had ideas about yourself.

93
00:07:18,043 --> 00:07:22,408
These days the way people are describing, they’ll say,
“I’m an extrovert”.

94
00:07:22,489 --> 00:07:24,463
Somebody will say, “I’m an introvert”,

95
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:30,683
somebody will say “I’m a hippie”, “I’m that”, I’m that.

96
00:07:30,764 --> 00:07:34,312
All kinds of things they can have attributed to themselves.

97
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:40,329
But these ideas are all coming from outside, they are not from inside.

98
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:46,785
To get to the inner side of yourself, the subtler side of your being,

99
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:51,198
you must allow the Kundalini to go through the Agnya.

100
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,604
And to cross the Agnya is a very important thing

101
00:07:53,685 --> 00:07:57,772
in modern times and for that you have to meditate.

102
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:02,288
If you can meditate with complete faith in yourself

103
00:08:02,369 --> 00:08:04,936
this Agnya can be opened out.

104
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:07,596
With surrendering to the Divine,

105
00:08:07,677 --> 00:08:10,184
you have to surrender yourself to the Divine.

106
00:08:10,265 --> 00:08:14,145
And when this Agnya opens, you’ll be amazed,

107
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:19,066
your Sahasrara is just waiting to transfer,

108
00:08:19,147 --> 00:08:25,906
to give you all the help that you need through the All-pervading Power.

109
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,160
Your connection of Sahasrara with

110
00:08:30,241 --> 00:08:32,715
the All-pervading Power is established.

111
00:08:32,796 --> 00:08:39,329
And by that you’ll be amazed how all these seven chakras work for you,

112
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:44,118
how they help you, how they try to give you

113
00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:48,328
whatever is the real knowledge about everything.

114
00:08:48,409 --> 00:08:53,168
This real knowledge that you get is very joy giving.

115
00:08:53,249 --> 00:08:56,249
You can see this real knowledge in everything.

116
00:08:56,329 --> 00:09:00,038
You don’t have to start reading any book about it.

117
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:05,708
In every situation and in every person, in every flower,

118
00:09:05,789 --> 00:09:13,249
in every natural happening, you see clearly the hand of the Divine.

119
00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:20,900
Once you see the hand of the Divine your egos start disappearing.

120
00:09:20,981 --> 00:09:25,647
Once you say that “It’s You. You do everything.”

121
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:29,854
Kabira has said something great about this,

122
00:09:29,935 --> 00:09:38,169
he said that when the goat is alive it goes on saying

123
00:09:38,249 --> 00:09:42,369
“Mai, mai” - “I am, I am”.

124
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:50,116
But when it is slaughtered and its intestines are made into strings,

125
00:09:50,197 --> 00:09:54,117
which are used for cleaning the cotton, then it said

126
00:09:54,198 --> 00:09:57,666
“tuhi, tuhi” - “you are, you are, you are”.

127
00:09:57,747 --> 00:10:01,734
See, in this symbolic way, they have suggested that:

128
00:10:01,815 --> 00:10:09,674
you have to become dissolved into this Divine power.

129
00:10:09,755 --> 00:10:13,248
“It’s the Divine power that does everything. What am I?

130
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:17,943
I was just a drop and I fell into this ocean of awareness

131
00:10:18,024 --> 00:10:23,369
of the Divine power and that is taking over and working it out.”

132
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:29,058
That will help you a lot to be a great Sahaja Yogi.

133
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:34,541
You developed curing powers, but still you are not proud of it.

134
00:10:34,622 --> 00:10:38,921
You developed, of course, awakening powers, you are not proud of it.

135
00:10:39,002 --> 00:10:43,640
You develop so many creative powers and you are not proud of it.

136
00:10:43,721 --> 00:10:48,328
You become really very, very creative, extremely creative.

137
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:50,369
But the greatest thing happend to you

138
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,409
that you become a global personality.

139
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,368
So you start seeing the problem of every country,

140
00:10:56,449 --> 00:11:00,577
of every other nation where they have problems.

141
00:11:00,658 --> 00:11:04,563
But these problems, when you see, you don’t see like other people.

142
00:11:04,655 --> 00:11:08,037
Because others may like to use it for their own purpose,

143
00:11:08,118 --> 00:11:10,533
maybe for media, maybe for something.

144
00:11:10,614 --> 00:11:15,288
But what you want to see is that these problems are solved.

145
00:11:15,369 --> 00:11:21,007
You see, your powers are so great, with this kind of a mind,

146
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:25,816
I would say, which is dominated completely by the Divine power,

147
00:11:25,897 --> 00:11:31,213
that it, whatever disturbs you,

148
00:11:31,294 --> 00:11:36,474
immediately it’s taken over and it starts working out.

149
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:40,368
Many, many problems have been solved by Sahaja Yoga

150
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:44,560
and also they can be solved on a very universal level,

151
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:47,561
if you are a global person.

152
00:11:47,642 --> 00:11:55,289
If you are a global person then what happens
is that you become a, sort of a, vehicle,

153
00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:59,408
or you can become like a channel for this Divine power

154
00:11:59,489 --> 00:12:04,289
to act because you are purely a global personality.

155
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:06,369
Not attached to this, attached to that,

156
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:10,734
but a pure Sahaja personality which can be used

157
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:13,815
by this Divine power very easily.

158
00:12:13,969 --> 00:12:17,288
For that, as I told in the afternoon also,

159
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:21,369
that we have to be careful about few things that we have.

160
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:25,896
Firstly anger, anger is the worst thing that we have.

161
00:12:25,977 --> 00:12:27,057
Angry for what?

162
00:12:27,138 --> 00:12:31,529
There are people who talk like this - “I was very angry” -
as if they’re proud of their anger.

163
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:36,288
Anger is a sign of complete stupidity, absolute stupidity.

164
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:40,247
And there’s no need to get angry with anyone because,

165
00:12:40,328 --> 00:12:43,288
by anger, you don’t solve the problem.

166
00:12:43,369 --> 00:12:45,544
With anger you spoil yourself.

167
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:50,111
With anger you ruin your own, own nature.

168
00:12:50,192 --> 00:12:54,112
With anger you really spoil the whole situation.

169
00:12:54,209 --> 00:13:01,129
So no use, no use having any anger about anything.

170
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:04,090
But if anything happens that angers you,

171
00:13:04,215 --> 00:13:06,940
you should settle down and see for yourself

172
00:13:07,021 --> 00:13:11,368
why is it wrong, why is it disturbing you?

173
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:17,847
Your seeing itself will help this problem to be solved.

174
00:13:17,928 --> 00:13:20,368
You must first of all realize that you are

175
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:23,369
a special personality that your Sahasrara

176
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:26,974
has been opened out to this all Divine power,

177
00:13:27,055 --> 00:13:32,270
as if you have entered into the realm of divinity.

178
00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:46,369
You are great guests in that great court of Divine domain.

179
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,856
You are not an ordinary person.

180
00:13:48,937 --> 00:13:54,368
And so once you understand why you have Sahaja Yoga

181
00:13:54,449 --> 00:14:00,152
and why you have got realization, is that there’s something special.

182
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:04,368
But that should not give you any ego.

183
00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:07,217
It’s not for ego that you have to have this,

184
00:14:07,298 --> 00:14:09,218
but it’s for understanding that

185
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:13,231
you have to play into the hands of the Divine.

186
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:18,208
It is this play is something I could explain like this,

187
00:14:18,289 --> 00:14:20,409
that: if you are, supposing, an artist,

188
00:14:20,489 --> 00:14:23,409
then in the hand of the artist is the brush

189
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:27,948
and the brush never thinks that it is doing anything.

190
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:30,665
It’s the artist who is doing everything.

191
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:35,368
In the same way, when you are one with the Divine power,

192
00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:39,601
you just feel “I’m not doing anything.

193
00:14:39,682 --> 00:14:42,736
It’s the Artist who’s doing it.

194
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:46,090
It’s the Artist who is managing”.
And who is the Artist?

195
00:14:46,171 --> 00:14:50,642
It’s this Divine power, which loves you, which cares for you,

196
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,843
which looks after you, which absolutely is identified with you.
