01:39:42.906 --> 01:39:51.486
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

01:39:51.486 --> 01:40:02.295
So much has been said and really my heart
is full of gratitude for all of you to come

01:40:02.295 --> 01:40:13.356
here, all the way, and the way people have
described about Sahaja Yoga.

01:40:13.356 --> 01:40:21.226
To understand Sahaja Yoga, we should know
where are we today in this Kali Yuga.

01:40:21.226 --> 01:40:23.876
What are we facing today?

01:40:23.876 --> 01:40:31.446
It should really make you feel quite disturbed
to see the way things are going on in every

01:40:31.446 --> 01:40:32.966
country, everywhere.

01:40:32.966 --> 01:40:35.926
What's the problem?

01:40:35.926 --> 01:40:47.986
What is the, such a need for people to become
so restless, full of tensions.

01:40:47.986 --> 01:40:55.616
Collectively, country-wise, anywhere you go
you find some sort of a confusion.

01:40:55.616 --> 01:40:58.186
Terrible.

01:40:58.186 --> 01:41:09.086
The whole society seems to be boiling with
a kind of a fear of destruction.

01:41:09.086 --> 01:41:10.276
What is the reason?

01:41:10.276 --> 01:41:16.246
There are so many religions, so many organized,
disorganized, all kinds of things.

01:41:16.246 --> 01:41:20.116
There are so many sadhus and saints.

01:41:20.116 --> 01:41:26.186
There are so many books written about what
you should have.

01:41:26.186 --> 01:41:40.616
But the only one who is a seeker of truth
should see one point: Why, why there is so

01:41:40.616 --> 01:41:45.926
much problem in this world and how can you
help them?

01:41:45.926 --> 01:41:48.665
Where is the problem?

01:41:48.665 --> 01:41:53.836
It is inside the human being.

01:41:53.836 --> 01:41:59.636
As described, you see, we have come out of
a animal stage to a human stage.

01:41:59.636 --> 01:42:02.276
We have a human awareness, no doubt.

01:42:02.276 --> 01:42:12.876
In that awareness, we start seeing all kinds
of things that are not good, which are destructive,

01:42:12.876 --> 01:42:14.836
which are disturbing.

01:42:14.836 --> 01:42:18.416
If it doesn't disturb you, that means you
are not at all a sensitive person.

01:42:18.416 --> 01:42:22.776
But you are sensitive as a human being.

01:42:22.776 --> 01:42:26.766
So now what is the reason for this, is there.

01:42:26.766 --> 01:42:33.886
In every field of life, whether it is political,
economic or any field of life in which human

01:42:33.886 --> 01:42:44.636
beings are living, there's a very subtle problem
which people don't understand.

01:42:44.636 --> 01:42:53.145
Now if I say that, "There is spirit within
us which shines in our heart," you need not

01:42:53.145 --> 01:42:55.526
believe, need not believe.

01:42:55.526 --> 01:43:00.206
But our attention is not on the spirit.

01:43:00.206 --> 01:43:08.956
They call it "atma vimukh" - our attention
is outside.

01:43:08.956 --> 01:43:17.946
At this stage at the human awareness, our
attention is outside, outside in various things.

01:43:17.946 --> 01:43:20.886
Now where should our attention go?

01:43:20.886 --> 01:43:24.346
To evolve, for what?

01:43:24.346 --> 01:43:26.786
To achieve what?

01:43:26.786 --> 01:43:41.946
The firstly, our attention has now go towards
our spirit, towards spiritual understanding.

01:43:41.946 --> 01:43:46.876
This is one thing has to happen to human beings
to begin with.

01:43:46.876 --> 01:43:49.056
Otherwise our attention is outside.

01:43:49.056 --> 01:43:54.866
We are worried about money, worried about
power, worried about this, worried about that,

01:43:54.866 --> 01:43:58.485
in competition and all kinds of things going
on.

01:43:58.485 --> 01:44:08.996
But if your attention is turned somehow towards
your spirit then what happens to you is that

01:44:08.996 --> 01:44:16.846
you become a power of the spirit.

01:44:16.846 --> 01:44:24.186
And the power of the spirit is the highest
power that you could think of.

01:44:24.186 --> 01:44:31.406
First of all, spirit is the one that loves.

01:44:31.406 --> 01:44:40.346
Loves without asking for anything, without
expecting anything, just loves.

01:44:40.346 --> 01:44:47.776
It's an unconditional type of a personality
which just emits love.

01:44:47.776 --> 01:44:54.246
Anybody in trouble, anybody having a problem,
just it flows.

01:44:54.246 --> 01:45:02.216
This capacity to flow in the heart exists
but on top of that, is the closing point,

01:45:02.216 --> 01:45:07.126
is that our attention is not on our spirit.

01:45:07.126 --> 01:45:14.385
Even in political endeavors or your economic
endeavors, any endeavor, what happens is that

01:45:14.385 --> 01:45:17.466
attention is outside.

01:45:17.466 --> 01:45:26.376
So you go into competition, you go into this
thing, you go on becoming very competent and

01:45:26.376 --> 01:45:30.036
then suddenly you find another one coming
up.

01:45:30.036 --> 01:45:35.926
There are so many struggles when your attention
is outside.

01:45:35.926 --> 01:45:41.046
Because in attention outside, there is no
purity.

01:45:41.046 --> 01:45:43.926
There is no purity.

01:45:43.926 --> 01:45:49.986
It's just attention to yourself and that too
is so limited.

01:45:49.986 --> 01:45:59.426
Very limited it is because if you pay attention
to yourself, there's no end to your troubles

01:45:59.426 --> 01:46:01.046
and woes.

01:46:01.046 --> 01:46:06.636
For a person, as they said, really is fact
that: I don't mind sleeping anywhere.

01:46:06.636 --> 01:46:08.646
I don't mind eating anything.

01:46:08.646 --> 01:46:12.256
I am not bothered about all these things,
is a fact.

01:46:12.256 --> 01:46:17.646
Because, you see, it's not very important
I think.

01:46:17.646 --> 01:46:19.665
But without thinking, I am made like that.

01:46:19.665 --> 01:46:21.486
I am like that, all right.

01:46:21.486 --> 01:46:24.246
But Sahaja yogis have become like this.

01:46:24.246 --> 01:46:32.616
This is the miracle that human beings have
turned their attention to their spirit.

01:46:32.616 --> 01:46:37.605
Then you are amazed how things work out.

01:46:37.605 --> 01:46:47.896
Without any competition, without any fights,
without any quarrels, how your attention becomes

01:46:47.896 --> 01:46:49.846
fixed on your spirit.

01:46:49.846 --> 01:46:55.346
First, the first thing that happens to you
is good health.

01:46:55.346 --> 01:46:58.466
Your health improves.

01:46:58.466 --> 01:47:04.575
Firstly, if your health is all right, I mean
so many problems are solved.

01:47:04.575 --> 01:47:09.586
This world, I think at least 30% people are
always sick.

01:47:09.586 --> 01:47:15.385
Because of the tensions, maybe because of
bad food and this and that.

01:47:15.385 --> 01:47:20.096
This is first thing that happens to you is
your health improves.

01:47:20.096 --> 01:47:27.706
Today now in Sahaja Yoga, we have people who
have learned that by these modern ways of

01:47:27.706 --> 01:47:32.706
economics and all that, has not given any
peace to anyone.

01:47:32.706 --> 01:47:38.436
We think of America; I mean I've been to America,
I know Americans: How terribly disturbed they

01:47:38.436 --> 01:47:39.436
are.

01:47:39.436 --> 01:47:40.436
Their families are ruined.

01:47:40.436 --> 01:47:41.436
Their children are ruined.

01:47:41.436 --> 01:47:45.156
And all kinds of stupid things are happening.

01:47:45.156 --> 01:47:49.206
Our Indian gurus are going and making a big
money there.

01:47:49.206 --> 01:47:50.876
And they just want peace.

01:47:50.876 --> 01:47:54.146
They just want peace of the heart.

01:47:54.146 --> 01:48:00.066
That's only possible when your attention goes
to your heart because in the heart resides

01:48:00.066 --> 01:48:05.186
the spirit and the spirit is the source of
peace.

01:48:05.186 --> 01:48:13.825
First is the love and second as I told you
just now is the peace.

01:48:13.825 --> 01:48:16.755
You become extremely peaceful.

01:48:16.755 --> 01:48:21.885
You become like a witness and you see the
whole drama like a joke.

01:48:21.885 --> 01:48:25.856
It's nothing so serious to be worried about.

01:48:25.856 --> 01:48:28.505
It all works out.

01:48:28.505 --> 01:48:36.216
And this is what one has to become is to become
the spirit which is your own, which is in

01:48:36.216 --> 01:48:44.886
your own heart and that is the source, as
I told you, of love and again I say of peace.

01:48:44.886 --> 01:48:56.036
And the third thing that happens to you, that
the source of spirit being joy, that joy bubbles

01:48:56.036 --> 01:48:57.955
in your life.

01:48:57.955 --> 01:48:59.226
It just bubbles in your life.

01:48:59.226 --> 01:49:07.356
You don't know how to get out of that great
ocean of joy.

01:49:07.356 --> 01:49:11.816
You start swimming in it, enjoying it, every
bit of it.

01:49:11.816 --> 01:49:18.185
You touch all the shores, going round the
whole world, their hearts and everything.

01:49:18.185 --> 01:49:20.786
It is in the heart that resides.

01:49:20.786 --> 01:49:24.955
Again I say, it is not in the brain.

01:49:24.955 --> 01:49:29.656
No mental activity can take you to spirit.

01:49:29.656 --> 01:49:35.465
Spirit is only possible if your attention
could be somehow taken to the spirit.

01:49:35.465 --> 01:49:40.156
And that's possible only through Kundalini
awakening.

01:49:40.156 --> 01:49:48.786
This change of attitude towards life, this
change of complete peace and joy has come

01:49:48.786 --> 01:49:55.156
to you all because your attention is now on
your spirit.

01:49:55.156 --> 01:49:59.175
Now you don't think of money, money walks
your way.

01:49:59.175 --> 01:50:02.536
You don't think of power, power walks your
way.

01:50:02.536 --> 01:50:13.465
And the power of the spirit is the highest,
the most powerful and the most righteous thing.

01:50:13.465 --> 01:50:22.046
It is not necessary that you should become
a sanyasi, sadhu baba, do all kinds of things.

01:50:22.046 --> 01:50:24.666
No necessity of these rituals.

01:50:24.666 --> 01:50:27.406
The spirit is residing within you.

01:50:27.406 --> 01:50:29.346
Already all you have done in last lives.

01:50:29.346 --> 01:50:35.156
Now this life only thing you have to do is
to put attention to your spirit.

01:50:35.156 --> 01:50:41.126
And that's only possible through the awakening
of this Kundalini - the Primordial Mother.

01:50:41.126 --> 01:50:45.916
When She starts, I mean that's also your own.

01:50:45.916 --> 01:50:55.546
When She starts rising, She passes through
the centers and enriches them, integrates

01:50:55.546 --> 01:51:03.515
them, and pierces through the last fontanel
bone area and makes you connected to this

01:51:03.515 --> 01:51:07.195
all pervading power of divine love.

01:51:07.195 --> 01:51:14.546
But this power of divine love is not only
"the love," if you want to say, it is also

01:51:14.546 --> 01:51:24.635
peace and joy and also it is the superior
wisdom.

01:51:24.635 --> 01:51:27.515
It is rather subtle for normal man to understand.

01:51:27.515 --> 01:51:28.515
I know that.

01:51:28.515 --> 01:51:29.906
I've gone through that.

01:51:29.906 --> 01:51:37.735
For persons to understand that one can become
the spirit .. but this is in the evolutionary

01:51:37.735 --> 01:51:38.735
process.

01:51:38.735 --> 01:51:42.675
Today is the time for people to become the
spirit.

01:51:42.675 --> 01:51:49.525
This is the blessing of this blossom time
as I call it and people have to become the

01:51:49.525 --> 01:51:50.856
spirit.

01:51:50.856 --> 01:51:56.606
Otherwise what is left of them is like all
other human beings who'll, I don't where they'll

01:51:56.606 --> 01:51:57.775
end up.

01:51:57.775 --> 01:52:03.106
So this is an essential step today to become
the spirit.

01:52:03.106 --> 01:52:08.985
All the saints, all the prophets, all the
religions have talked about it.

01:52:08.985 --> 01:52:10.166
Not that they have not.

01:52:10.166 --> 01:52:12.075
Of course, we have twisted them.

01:52:12.075 --> 01:52:15.175
We have made separate, separate things.

01:52:15.175 --> 01:52:26.365
But it's only one simple thing is that you
are a spirit and that spirit, unless and until

01:52:26.365 --> 01:52:36.085
you become, you cannot achieve any peace,
any joy and no love.

01:52:36.085 --> 01:52:44.395
The Sahaja yogis here are sitting have achieved
it.

01:52:44.395 --> 01:52:51.176
They don't think they are from foreign countries
or from this country or that country.

01:52:51.176 --> 01:52:52.176
They don't want.

01:52:52.176 --> 01:52:58.346
Now here it is in this camp we don't have
very good arrangement for sleeping or eating

01:52:58.346 --> 01:53:01.005
or anything, no good bathrooms, nothing.

01:53:01.005 --> 01:53:04.455
They are just enjoying themselves.

01:53:04.455 --> 01:53:05.455
Nobody minds it.

01:53:05.455 --> 01:53:09.635
Of course certain things of particular country
may linger on.

01:53:09.635 --> 01:53:13.525
But then it drops, it drops.

01:53:13.525 --> 01:53:17.416
Gradually it starts dropping out.

01:53:17.416 --> 01:53:20.376
Like a flower when it becomes the fruit.

01:53:20.376 --> 01:53:26.056
All its petals and everything drops out and
then it becomes the fruit.

01:53:26.056 --> 01:53:34.385
So you have now become the fruit -fruit of
knowledge, fruit of wisdom and of love.

01:53:34.385 --> 01:53:38.395
For knowledge, you don't have to read books.

01:53:38.395 --> 01:53:39.585
There's no need to.

01:53:39.585 --> 01:53:43.476
People who have read too many are difficult
to get Sahaja Yoga.

01:53:43.476 --> 01:53:51.215
But what you have to see yourself: What is
the reality?

01:53:51.215 --> 01:53:56.575
But that's only possible if you are a realized
soul.

01:53:56.575 --> 01:54:00.335
Otherwise you get lost in the illusions of
the world.

01:54:00.335 --> 01:54:04.855
You live with the illusions all your life,
struggling, fighting and I don't want to say

01:54:04.855 --> 01:54:07.085
what's the end is.

01:54:07.085 --> 01:54:13.385
So a simple thing that has happened with Sahaja
Yoga, in your evolutionary process your attention

01:54:13.385 --> 01:54:18.835
now has gone to spirit than to anything else.

01:54:18.835 --> 01:54:26.055
As soon as the power of the spirit comes,
you find yourself successful in everything.

01:54:26.055 --> 01:54:27.666
You don't want;.

01:54:27.666 --> 01:54:33.735
You don't ask for it and if you are not, you
don't mind.

01:54:33.735 --> 01:54:36.115
You don't mind because you think they don't
understand.

01:54:36.115 --> 01:54:38.695
It's all right, forget it.

01:54:38.695 --> 01:54:42.566
So there's no use fighting for it, asking
for it.

01:54:42.566 --> 01:54:51.545
For this, one thing is important, first and
foremost thing, you have to forgive everyone.

01:54:51.545 --> 01:54:56.416
Human beings, I don't know sometimes they're
illogical.

01:54:56.416 --> 01:54:58.816
Supposing somebody tries to harm you.

01:54:58.816 --> 01:55:01.085
All right, I forgive him.

01:55:01.085 --> 01:55:04.495
Forget it because I have no headache of that.

01:55:04.495 --> 01:55:08.625
What he is trying to do is to give me a headache
which I will not take.

01:55:08.625 --> 01:55:10.495
I just forgive.

01:55:10.495 --> 01:55:15.735
So that is a very important point, that Christ
has also said that, "You have to forgive."

01:55:15.735 --> 01:55:21.085
Mohammad Sahib has said so many things but
I don't know how people have twisted.

01:55:21.085 --> 01:55:25.455
Christ has said so many things, how I don't
know how they are being twisted.

01:55:25.455 --> 01:55:32.235
Every one of them has said one thing: that
you have to become the Spirit.

01:55:32.235 --> 01:55:38.656
And how people have twisted it and have formed
so many religions and in that religion why

01:55:38.656 --> 01:55:39.985
should they quarrel?

01:55:39.985 --> 01:55:43.715
If there is one God there should be no quarrel.

01:55:43.715 --> 01:55:48.515
Now in Sahaja yoga, you find people have come
from different race, different countries,

01:55:48.515 --> 01:55:51.335
different ideologies, everything.

01:55:51.335 --> 01:55:54.476
One thing great about Sahaja yogis, they are
very pure people.

01:55:54.476 --> 01:55:57.275
There's so much of purity in them.

01:55:57.275 --> 01:55:58.275
There's no problem.

01:55:58.275 --> 01:56:05.786
I do not have that problem of immorality in
Sahaja Yoga.

01:56:05.786 --> 01:56:08.455
We don't find anybody being immoral.

01:56:08.455 --> 01:56:12.695
If somebody has been immoral, he just gets
corrected.

01:56:12.695 --> 01:56:17.125
If somebody has been cheating, he gets corrected.

01:56:17.125 --> 01:56:23.165
If somebody has been a corrupt person, he
gets corrected.

01:56:23.165 --> 01:56:30.745
Because spirit gives the light for you to
see for yourself what is good for you.

01:56:30.745 --> 01:56:34.536
Supposing you are going on a road and you
are blind.

01:56:34.536 --> 01:56:37.085
You can walk into a ditch.

01:56:37.085 --> 01:56:40.685
But supposing you have the light and the eyes
open.

01:56:40.685 --> 01:56:42.425
You know how to go.

01:56:42.425 --> 01:56:48.686
And that's exactly what has happened in Sahaja
Yoga, that people have realized how to move,

01:56:48.686 --> 01:56:55.206
how to go about, how to walk, and not to fall
in the ditch.

01:56:55.206 --> 01:56:59.145
I have seen people who have fallen into ditch
also.

01:56:59.145 --> 01:57:01.436
But I have nothing but love for them.

01:57:01.436 --> 01:57:06.706
Because they were blind, you see, for a blind
person you can just have love, isn't it?

01:57:06.706 --> 01:57:13.636
And I found that once I forgive them completely
and I ask them, all right, even if they have

01:57:13.636 --> 01:57:17.585
abused Me, said things against Me, it's all
right.

01:57:17.585 --> 01:57:19.575
Because they don't know what they are doing.

01:57:19.575 --> 01:57:21.735
They are blind people.

01:57:21.735 --> 01:57:27.975
So once you feel that way about others, that
doesn't matter.

01:57:27.975 --> 01:57:35.225
Whatever they have done, whatever they have
so far, so called harmed you also, is no harm

01:57:35.225 --> 01:57:41.475
to you because you are standing on a pedestal
of truth.

01:57:41.475 --> 01:57:48.745
So the second point is that the spirit is
the source of truth, not of untruth.

01:57:48.745 --> 01:57:52.745
For example, there is some false guru.

01:57:52.745 --> 01:57:54.886
Immediately you will know who is false.

01:57:54.886 --> 01:57:55.886
How?

01:57:55.886 --> 01:58:01.776
On your vibrations, on your fingertips you
know that this man is false.

01:58:01.776 --> 01:58:07.906
Is all said by Mohammad Sahib that, "Your
hands will speak at the time of resurrection."

01:58:07.906 --> 01:58:12.215
That exactly happens that you see: this is
the trouble.

01:58:12.215 --> 01:58:18.995
Now if you want you can avoid that person
or if you want you can bring him round and

01:58:18.995 --> 01:58:20.176
put him right.

01:58:20.176 --> 01:58:28.286
But we should not try on the complicated characters
very much in the beginning, I said, because

01:58:28.286 --> 01:58:30.105
they will complicate you.

01:58:30.105 --> 01:58:36.975
Now those people who have matured in Sahaja
Yoga can easily manage that also.

01:58:36.975 --> 01:58:42.066
And also we must know that all the elements
are working for us.

01:58:42.066 --> 01:58:49.485
All the events of the world are just to show
how wrong things are wrong and how right things

01:58:49.485 --> 01:58:50.676
should be done.

01:58:50.676 --> 01:58:53.945
Say for example, when Hitler came.

01:58:53.945 --> 01:58:55.845
He started destroying people.

01:58:55.845 --> 01:58:58.806
And he took nine years to build himself up.

01:58:58.806 --> 01:59:04.756
And he did all kinds of things which cannot
be forgiven by anyone.

01:59:04.756 --> 01:59:11.355
But he died and suddenly you find in Germany,
people are so enlightened.

01:59:11.355 --> 01:59:19.926
Now you heard some people, I was amazed how
they are so enlightened about love and about

01:59:19.926 --> 01:59:21.626
the divine.

01:59:21.626 --> 01:59:28.096
All these countries, I've seen are doing so
well unexpectedly.

01:59:28.096 --> 01:59:34.105
Imagine in England, who came to India and
ruled us for three hundred years, there are

01:59:34.105 --> 01:59:36.206
so many Sahaja yogis.

01:59:36.206 --> 01:59:44.656
And also as you see today when I speak there,
we have the whole hall filled up with people,

01:59:44.656 --> 01:59:45.656
in England.

01:59:45.656 --> 01:59:54.516
I've seen also in the countries like Russia,
where these people were on the verge of collapsing

01:59:54.516 --> 01:59:57.725
after they started on democracy.

01:59:57.725 --> 02:00:04.235
Whether it is democracy or communism or anything,
these are all isms.

02:00:04.235 --> 02:00:10.686
You have to come out of it and see for yourself
that so called democracy has become demon-ocracy.

02:00:10.686 --> 02:00:14.965
So called communism has failed.

02:00:14.965 --> 02:00:15.965
Why?

02:00:15.965 --> 02:00:17.735
Basically what's wrong with them?

02:00:17.735 --> 02:00:22.605
It was all based not on the spiritual level.

02:00:22.605 --> 02:00:24.896
There was no spirit involved in it.

02:00:24.896 --> 02:00:36.886
It was all based on, I should say, on the
endeavors which are outside, which were very

02:00:36.886 --> 02:00:38.046
limited.

02:00:38.046 --> 02:00:42.065
And those limits, once they break, you see
you have a problem.

02:00:42.065 --> 02:00:46.196
Now economics, the world economics if you
see is collapsing.

02:00:46.196 --> 02:00:48.495
Everywhere there is recession.

02:00:48.495 --> 02:00:53.146
If they are such experts then why there is
recession?

02:00:53.146 --> 02:00:54.806
Why there are problems?

02:00:54.806 --> 02:00:57.566
Now the people say we must remove the poverty.

02:00:57.566 --> 02:01:07.306
I agree but not by giving some sort of a beggar's
gift but with self respect.

02:01:07.306 --> 02:01:11.776
You can do it.

02:01:11.776 --> 02:01:22.546
You can do it because if you can approach
people who need with Sahaja Yoga and enrich

02:01:22.546 --> 02:01:28.725
them, you'll be amazed, they themselves will
do better and work it out.

02:01:28.725 --> 02:01:34.756
All kinds of things, you see, like in abroad
people used to say, "Mother, You talk of spiritual

02:01:34.756 --> 02:01:37.156
life then why is it India is so poor?"

02:01:37.156 --> 02:01:41.266
I said, "They are not so poor in spirituality."

02:01:41.266 --> 02:01:44.705
They may be poor in money.

02:01:44.705 --> 02:01:49.995
Those who have got lots of money, are they
also very good people?

02:01:49.995 --> 02:01:52.995
Are they also doing something very good?

02:01:52.995 --> 02:01:57.945
In the same way, those who are poor are not
doing something good that one should have

02:01:57.945 --> 02:01:59.066
compassion on them.

02:01:59.066 --> 02:02:00.066
Agreed.

02:02:00.066 --> 02:02:02.245
Now what to do?

02:02:02.245 --> 02:02:05.335
If both sides are so miserable, what should
we do?

02:02:05.335 --> 02:02:06.815
Is to change them.

02:02:06.815 --> 02:02:11.495
Change the whole attitude towards life.

02:02:11.495 --> 02:02:17.906
Immediately I've seen people who are supposed
to be rich start understanding poverty.

02:02:17.906 --> 02:02:21.416
They start sharing.

02:02:21.416 --> 02:02:24.866
They start working it out.

02:02:24.866 --> 02:02:29.836
In Sahaja Yoga, you'll be amazed how people
help each other.

02:02:29.836 --> 02:02:38.636
How they work out everybody's difficulties
and problems into something very beautiful.

02:02:38.636 --> 02:02:43.626
You see, it's the wisdom that you get from
this all pervading divine power.

02:02:43.626 --> 02:02:47.256
This power has been described in every religion.

02:02:47.256 --> 02:02:53.386
You call it nirakar, you call it ruuh, you
can call it paramchaitanya; you can call by

02:02:53.386 --> 02:02:54.806
any name.

02:02:54.806 --> 02:02:57.016
But name is not the point.

02:02:57.016 --> 02:03:01.605
Whatever it is, once you are connected with
this power, you are blessed.

02:03:01.605 --> 02:03:06.396
Thousand times you are blessed than you are
as a normal human being.

02:03:06.396 --> 02:03:10.616
As a normal being, no blessings it has.

02:03:10.616 --> 02:03:15.985
It has nothing but your own endeavors that
the amount you push in, that's what you get.

02:03:15.985 --> 02:03:21.136
Here nobody pushes oneself.

02:03:21.136 --> 02:03:22.926
Automatically you are pushed into that.

02:03:22.926 --> 02:03:27.516
This force, divine force brings you to that.

02:03:27.516 --> 02:03:32.396
And you have seen that in your own lives how
you came to Me, how you came to Sahaja Yoga.

02:03:32.396 --> 02:03:39.845
It was some sort of a divine force which worked
it out, which is Sahaja, which you may not

02:03:39.845 --> 02:03:45.059
realize but when you get your realization,
you just think about your own life: "How I

02:03:45.059 --> 02:03:48.745
came to Sahaja Yoga?

02:03:48.745 --> 02:03:50.656
How I got this?"

02:03:50.656 --> 02:03:55.006
And then you see this peace, reigning over
your hearts.

02:03:55.006 --> 02:03:58.506
The love, affection, everything.

02:03:58.506 --> 02:04:05.636
What is, as you said, I have many powers,
maybe I don't know, but one thing for definite,

02:04:05.636 --> 02:04:16.656
one thing that Sahaja yogis can get all My
powers.

02:04:16.656 --> 02:04:27.066
As a Mother, Mother wants to give everything
to Sahaja yogis.

02:04:27.066 --> 02:04:38.446
This greatest joy for a Mother is to see Her
son or daughter grow up like Her.

02:04:38.446 --> 02:04:44.595
I, I have a great vision of life.

02:04:44.595 --> 02:04:49.995
And I see the picture of that here today.

02:04:49.995 --> 02:04:54.876
I was a ordinary housewife without much money.

02:04:54.876 --> 02:04:56.756
You know My interest in money is zero.

02:04:56.756 --> 02:05:02.235
I don't understand even the bank and the somebody
has to sign a cheque for Me.

02:05:02.235 --> 02:05:05.796
My husband has to count My money, I am so
bad.

02:05:05.796 --> 02:05:08.416
But still I've never had problem.

02:05:08.416 --> 02:05:18.355
Never had problem because it is the greed
in man, terrible greed in man that creates

02:05:18.355 --> 02:05:19.465
problems.

02:05:19.465 --> 02:05:27.506
But if he learns how to be satisfied, automatically
the greed drops out and you feel absolutely

02:05:27.506 --> 02:05:28.506
comfortable.

02:05:28.506 --> 02:05:33.906
But that doesn't mean that you become a sadhu
baba or you become a sanyasi or a something

02:05:33.906 --> 02:05:35.256
you give up.

02:05:35.256 --> 02:05:37.006
Those days are gone.

02:05:37.006 --> 02:05:39.577
Those ordeals you have passed through.

02:05:39.577 --> 02:05:40.577
You've been to the Himalayas.

02:05:40.577 --> 02:05:43.355
You've stood on your heads and did all kinds
of things.

02:05:43.355 --> 02:05:45.406
Now no more is needed.

02:05:45.406 --> 02:05:52.026
What is needed is that: you have to put your
attention to your spirit, the more you do

02:05:52.026 --> 02:06:01.695
it, the more you absorb all other attentions
and put it to your spirit, which is there

02:06:01.695 --> 02:06:03.386
already existing.

02:06:03.386 --> 02:06:08.416
There is nothing to be brought from outside
or nothing to be learnt.

02:06:08.416 --> 02:06:12.786
It is inside every one of you, is in the heart.

02:06:12.786 --> 02:06:17.636
Only thing you have to, you have to just feel
it.

02:06:17.636 --> 02:06:24.455
Now that feeling can only come if you are
awakened in the Kundalini.

02:06:24.455 --> 02:06:38.235
I know that no one like Mohammad Sahib or
Christ or Abraham or Moses, who have created

02:06:38.235 --> 02:06:46.075
books or whatever history they have created,
no where They would have ever thought that

02:06:46.075 --> 02:06:54.896
people will form an organized religion and
start in a way as if they are against each

02:06:54.896 --> 02:06:55.896
other.

02:06:55.896 --> 02:06:58.286
But it has happened.

02:06:58.286 --> 02:07:00.335
It has happened.

02:07:00.335 --> 02:07:07.075
To remove that, you have to give them the
knowledge, the pure knowledge.

02:07:07.075 --> 02:07:10.176
Not the knowledge of the book but the pure
knowledge.

02:07:10.176 --> 02:07:14.176
And the knowledge that is pure is wisdom.

02:07:14.176 --> 02:07:18.435
Through this wisdom only I've worked.

02:07:18.435 --> 02:07:21.126
This wisdom I had from My childhood.

02:07:21.126 --> 02:07:22.215
Nobody has given Me.

02:07:22.215 --> 02:07:23.215
It's there.

02:07:23.215 --> 02:07:30.095
But this wisdom has taught Me one thing: that
whatsoever maybe the condition of a human

02:07:30.095 --> 02:07:39.186
being, whatsoever maybe his style, whatsoever
may be his ego or his conditioning if he can

02:07:39.186 --> 02:07:45.865
feel the love then his spirit gets [transformed?].

02:07:45.865 --> 02:07:48.896
This transformation has taken place.

02:07:48.896 --> 02:07:55.266
Here we have only one percent of the people
who have got realization all over the world.

02:07:55.266 --> 02:08:03.896
But I know, I remember them all today who
are not here, that they have been seekers,

02:08:03.896 --> 02:08:08.705
madly seeking, seeking the truth.

02:08:08.705 --> 02:08:12.315
They went through horrible time seeking.

02:08:12.315 --> 02:08:13.615
They had very bad gurus.

02:08:13.615 --> 02:08:17.396
They had all kinds of expenses, everything
they did.

02:08:17.396 --> 02:08:22.695
But once they came to Sahaja Yoga, they have
found what was the truth is.

02:08:22.695 --> 02:08:27.495
And the truth is very simple: that you are
the spirit.

02:08:27.495 --> 02:08:33.985
You are not this body, this mind, but you
are the spirit.

02:08:33.985 --> 02:08:37.876
This is the truth and they have found the
spirit.

02:08:37.876 --> 02:08:41.526
That's what is the truth that they have found.

02:08:41.526 --> 02:08:49.565
Once this truth is established within you,
that you are the spirit, nothing can destroy

02:08:49.565 --> 02:08:53.386
you, nothing can harm you.

02:08:53.386 --> 02:08:56.156
It cannot have any wants.

02:08:56.156 --> 02:08:57.156
It doesn't have.

02:08:57.156 --> 02:09:02.115
What wants can you have when you have the
spirit because such a satisfying thing?

02:09:02.115 --> 02:09:05.965
It doesn't condemn anyone.

02:09:05.965 --> 02:09:09.435
It doesn't runs after anyone.

02:09:09.435 --> 02:09:14.075
Is satisfied with itself, absolutely satisfied.

02:09:14.075 --> 02:09:19.735
You see, I was very anxious that I should
lead a very normal life.

02:09:19.735 --> 02:09:25.825
I should not be like some Himalaya fellow
or something like that.

02:09:25.825 --> 02:09:30.085
Because this is needed for a common people.

02:09:30.085 --> 02:09:36.636
Today it's a aim en mass, en mass awakening.

02:09:36.636 --> 02:09:38.695
It is not for one person.

02:09:38.695 --> 02:09:45.615
This was the thing because once any discovery
is made, supposing, and that discovery only

02:09:45.615 --> 02:09:48.335
is for one individual, it has no meaning.

02:09:48.335 --> 02:09:50.266
It has to go to masses.

02:09:50.266 --> 02:09:54.646
And this is what I knew: I have to do it.

02:09:54.646 --> 02:09:59.855
And I had to work - they say so but I don't
think I ever worked.

02:09:59.855 --> 02:10:02.185
I was just witness to whole thing.

02:10:02.185 --> 02:10:09.656
I saw it just like a witness enjoying all
kinds of things as you sit on the shore of

02:10:09.656 --> 02:10:10.656
a ocean.

02:10:10.656 --> 02:10:14.026
You see waves coming, going like that.

02:10:14.026 --> 02:10:25.086
But inside, inside that is a human being who
wants to evolve, who wants to become the spirit.

02:10:25.086 --> 02:10:28.886
Then he starts thinking what good he can do
to others.

02:10:28.886 --> 02:10:35.276
So far I've been very anxious that people
should become Sahaja yogis.

02:10:35.276 --> 02:10:39.595
I didn't take to any missionary work or any
social work.

02:10:39.595 --> 02:10:44.516
I used to do when I was not in Sahaja Yoga,
I should say, when I didn't start the Sahaja

02:10:44.516 --> 02:10:45.516
Yoga.

02:10:45.516 --> 02:10:54.575
But later on, I discovered that unless and
until you transform people, unless and until

02:10:54.575 --> 02:10:59.636
you become the spirit, you'll become like
any other social worker.

02:10:59.636 --> 02:11:02.335
I was working in a, say, blind school.

02:11:02.335 --> 02:11:07.376
I was the chairman of the blind school, blind
people.

02:11:07.376 --> 02:11:13.906
And I was surprised, the people who were with
Me were very funny type you know?

02:11:13.906 --> 02:11:19.006
The governor was to come and they said, "Who
will sit next to governor?"

02:11:19.006 --> 02:11:21.095
I said, "What is this?"

02:11:21.095 --> 02:11:25.185
So they said also, "I being the president,
I have to sit."

02:11:25.185 --> 02:11:26.575
I said, "Not necessary.

02:11:26.575 --> 02:11:28.156
I can sit anywhere."

02:11:28.156 --> 02:11:31.095
But they all started quarreling on this point.

02:11:31.095 --> 02:11:39.036
So I said, "All right, we'll take a plank
and put it on head of the - of the governor

02:11:39.036 --> 02:11:42.845
and you all sit on that like sparrows."

02:11:42.845 --> 02:11:45.935
That humor helped a lot and they settled down.

02:11:45.935 --> 02:11:52.136
So this is the stupid thing where you see
it, what is your position, what do you get?

02:11:52.136 --> 02:11:59.445
I mean it's so stupid that even the ant knows
how to work out the collectivity.

02:11:59.445 --> 02:12:06.195
I don't know how human beings are dying after
useless nonsensical things.

02:12:06.195 --> 02:12:10.805
But the only thing is, he has not yet become
the spirit.

02:12:10.805 --> 02:12:14.865
So he doesn't respect himself, no respect.

02:12:14.865 --> 02:12:20.776
So he does all these things which are not
very respectable I think.

02:12:20.776 --> 02:12:27.536
Then I thought that this kind of work people
are doing, they think no end of themselves.

02:12:27.536 --> 02:12:34.416
Once you start doing something good, why should
you think you are very great?

02:12:34.416 --> 02:12:40.065
I, I can't understand, you see, My brain is
that way useless.

02:12:40.065 --> 02:12:45.316
Because what I found with these people who
were working with Me, very anxious to take

02:12:45.316 --> 02:12:47.286
the credit for this.

02:12:47.286 --> 02:12:49.896
Somebody wanted to become the chairman, vice-chairman.

02:12:49.896 --> 02:12:52.425
I said, "You become everything."

02:12:52.425 --> 02:12:59.876
So the attention being on your promotion,
it's not a real promotion, no promotion.

02:12:59.876 --> 02:13:05.675
Everybody used to laugh at them, it's a degradation.

02:13:05.675 --> 02:13:15.266
Your promotion is not through your own being
but through your own spirit.

02:13:15.266 --> 02:13:22.316
Being means a very big thing, I think, but
spirit is very subtle, very beautiful which

02:13:22.316 --> 02:13:24.626
is residing in all of you like a light.

02:13:24.626 --> 02:13:27.656
It's a light in you.

02:13:27.656 --> 02:13:32.156
Now there are Sahaja, so many Sahaja yogis
who are giving enlightenment to others.

02:13:32.156 --> 02:13:34.956
There are people who are going all over the
world.

02:13:34.956 --> 02:13:45.016
I was surprised that people from Germany and
Austria came to help Me when I first went

02:13:45.016 --> 02:13:46.016
to Russia.

02:13:46.016 --> 02:13:48.706
I said, "What are you doing here?"

02:13:48.706 --> 02:13:55.406
Said, "Mother we have to do something because
so many people were killed by our forefathers."

02:13:55.406 --> 02:14:00.436
Then My heart started really thanking them.

02:14:00.436 --> 02:14:03.805
Look at this, what has come into them?

02:14:03.805 --> 02:14:10.426
Then they went, you'll be amazed, to Israel
and from Israel they brought lots of Sahaja

02:14:10.426 --> 02:14:11.746
yogis to Egypt.

02:14:11.746 --> 02:14:15.795
So I asked the Israelis, Sahaja yogis, "Why
are you here?"

02:14:15.795 --> 02:14:24.315
They said, "Mother it's our job now to make
friends with these Sahaja yogis from Egypt."

02:14:24.315 --> 02:14:33.126
Just see how love engulfs all these angularities,
all these thorns of life and dissolves it

02:14:33.126 --> 02:14:35.255
completely.

02:14:35.255 --> 02:14:42.336
It's so joy giving to see your love acting
on others.

02:14:42.336 --> 02:14:48.416
Small, small things and very big things, all
that works out with love.

02:14:48.416 --> 02:14:58.206
For example, in an industry now people have
problems of strikes.

02:14:58.206 --> 02:15:09.456
Very common struggle, haves and have not and
this going on.

02:15:09.456 --> 02:15:16.235
But if you can raise the people to the spiritual
height, to their spiritual need which is the

02:15:16.235 --> 02:15:25.166
most important need today, you'll be amazed
there will be no problem of any kind.

02:15:25.166 --> 02:15:29.265
You see, it is a kind of a communism.

02:15:29.265 --> 02:15:31.495
It's a kind of a socialism.

02:15:31.495 --> 02:15:33.746
It's a kind of a democracy.

02:15:33.746 --> 02:15:38.626
It's all things put together which works.

02:15:38.626 --> 02:15:46.305
Democracy means we have Sahaja yogis who wanted
to organize this.

02:15:46.305 --> 02:15:49.016
They said, "Mother what should we do?"

02:15:49.016 --> 02:15:50.616
I said, "I am not going to say anything.

02:15:50.616 --> 02:15:52.515
You do what you like.

02:15:52.515 --> 02:15:57.086
You choose whatever you like, whatever you
want to do."

02:15:57.086 --> 02:16:01.745
And I was just busy arranging the flowers
in the house because so many flowers came

02:16:01.745 --> 02:16:03.045
and I am worried about the flowers.

02:16:03.045 --> 02:16:06.005
I was just arranging the flowers in the house.

02:16:06.005 --> 02:16:14.916
And what I find, now see how they've done:
no quarrel, no fight, no discussion, nothing.

02:16:14.916 --> 02:16:17.896
How have they done?

02:16:17.896 --> 02:16:21.756
Otherwise you cannot make ten people sit together
and talk the same way.

02:16:21.756 --> 02:16:25.805
One will talk, another will talk, another
will talk, will go on discussing, discussing

02:16:25.805 --> 02:16:29.285
this, reaching nowhere.

02:16:29.285 --> 02:16:33.186
Otherwise only one man has to work it out,
otherwise nothing can work.

02:16:33.186 --> 02:16:42.216
So you see, it changes the whole atmosphere
of every human being.

02:16:42.216 --> 02:16:49.756
Changes his attitude, changes his endeavors
and everything becomes so beautiful and joy

02:16:49.756 --> 02:16:54.426
giving.

02:16:54.426 --> 02:17:01.126
You are a socialist also because you start
thinking about the people who are down trodden,

02:17:01.126 --> 02:17:10.035
people who have no money who are poor, and
you try to work out something by which they

02:17:10.035 --> 02:17:11.745
get some money.

02:17:11.745 --> 02:17:18.486
I used to go with My father for a case in
a district called Chanda.

02:17:18.486 --> 02:17:23.066
And there I saw people just with one cloth
around them.

02:17:23.066 --> 02:17:30.156
What was shocking to Me: just one cloth, whether
it is winter or summer.

02:17:30.156 --> 02:17:36.136
I used to weep so My father would say, "Why
to weep before them?"

02:17:36.136 --> 02:17:37.716
I said, "What can I do?

02:17:37.716 --> 02:17:40.496
I must try to do something for them."

02:17:40.496 --> 02:17:49.346
Now when I got so many Sahaja yogis, I told
them, "I want to help these people somehow.

02:17:49.346 --> 02:17:53.586
And what they make is pottery."

02:17:53.586 --> 02:17:55.206
So they said, "Mother, all right.

02:17:55.206 --> 02:17:56.566
You can get the pottery.

02:17:56.566 --> 02:18:00.146
We'll import here and we'll sell them."

02:18:00.146 --> 02:18:06.456
You'll be amazed now, these people have got
houses, they have got a good life to live

02:18:06.456 --> 02:18:08.186
and they are living very well.

02:18:08.186 --> 02:18:12.666
So in a way, it is a kind of a socialism.

02:18:12.666 --> 02:18:20.706
That you see problems and you know collectively
to solve it, collectively, not singularly

02:18:20.706 --> 02:18:21.706
but collectively.

02:18:21.706 --> 02:18:26.406
The all of the Sahaja yogis suggest, "Mother,
this can be solved."

02:18:26.406 --> 02:18:34.036
So far I have not done anything directly,
I must say, like starting a organization of

02:18:34.036 --> 02:18:35.166
that kind.

02:18:35.166 --> 02:18:41.106
But now when there are so many Sahaja yogis
with their attention on their heart, now My

02:18:41.106 --> 02:18:46.136
attention is going to the people who need
our help.

02:18:46.136 --> 02:18:53.466
So first time, I have asked them to make an
NGO for destitute women and for children who

02:18:53.466 --> 02:18:56.786
are being deserted by their parents.

02:18:56.786 --> 02:19:00.285
And immediately, you'll be amazed, it all
did.

02:19:00.285 --> 02:19:01.285
We got the land.

02:19:01.285 --> 02:19:02.285
We got the people.

02:19:02.285 --> 02:19:06.216
I mean, I'm not doing anything and it's all
done.

02:19:06.216 --> 02:19:10.956
Moreover, so many people have written, "Mother
if You want land, we can give You.

02:19:10.956 --> 02:19:13.426
You come here, do this, do that."

02:19:13.426 --> 02:19:14.996
Can you imagine?

02:19:14.996 --> 02:19:19.976
Once I just thought of it: that we have to
do something for the poor people.

02:19:19.976 --> 02:19:28.086
Also other so many things can be done with
your attention which is pure, full of love

02:19:28.086 --> 02:19:35.436
because the love, you see, is something that
gives you the wisdom how to do it.

02:19:35.436 --> 02:19:43.656
If you have love, it gives you the complete
insight into the problems and how it works.

02:19:43.656 --> 02:19:54.116
See it's surprising for Me, I mean, I used
to do that always but even after Sahaja Yoga

02:19:54.116 --> 02:19:58.216
I found that is the love is the solution.

02:19:58.216 --> 02:20:04.485
Is this only way we can enter into the hearts
of people.

02:20:04.485 --> 02:20:10.795
But for that love, we should not try to do
it for some money or for some achievements

02:20:10.795 --> 02:20:20.366
or for some sort of a reward, but just the
whim of the love and that is what is today

02:20:20.366 --> 02:20:25.596
paying all of you: The way you love all the
people.

02:20:25.596 --> 02:20:27.057
The way you have done so much work.

02:20:27.057 --> 02:20:31.716
You don't know what gratitude I have for you.

02:20:31.716 --> 02:20:33.876
Single-handed I could not have done it.

02:20:33.876 --> 02:20:36.406
I could not have gone to so many countries.

02:20:36.406 --> 02:20:41.976
It's a like a place like Benin, where there
are only Muslims are there, I would never

02:20:41.976 --> 02:20:47.636
- I could never have thought of going to that
far fetched place where these people are there

02:20:47.636 --> 02:20:52.736
and imagine these people are Muslims and they
have all taken to Sahaja Yoga.

02:20:52.736 --> 02:20:57.826
And in that they are understanding the beauty
of love.

02:20:57.826 --> 02:21:00.285
You, this is done by French.

02:21:00.285 --> 02:21:03.826
Can you believe these French?

02:21:03.826 --> 02:21:08.976
Going down all the way to Benin and getting
it done.

02:21:08.976 --> 02:21:20.426
Even English have gone all the way to different
countries; even the Austrians and also Germans

02:21:20.426 --> 02:21:26.716
and Italians are another quality of people
who have a very rich heart, I must say.

02:21:26.716 --> 02:21:32.846
They have a very rich heart and the way they
are spreading Sahaja Yoga throughout Italy

02:21:32.846 --> 02:21:34.146
is really remarkable.

02:21:34.146 --> 02:21:43.186
I am amazed how these people are approaching
all these people who have never known what

02:21:43.186 --> 02:21:48.295
is spirit is and how they are getting them
to Mother.

02:21:48.295 --> 02:21:52.666
Now with that, you see, we don't have to say
"prohibition."

02:21:52.666 --> 02:21:56.096
We don't have to say "don't take drugs," nothing.

02:21:56.096 --> 02:21:58.886
No don'ts in Sahaja Yoga.

02:21:58.886 --> 02:21:59.916
Automatically they drop.

02:21:59.916 --> 02:22:02.706
I don't have to say, "Don't do it."

02:22:02.706 --> 02:22:05.156
Just automatically they drop.

02:22:05.156 --> 02:22:13.916
I mean you'll be amazed, once we had a program
and there was a light to be put in a one of

02:22:13.916 --> 02:22:18.616
the deepas and nobody had a matchbox.

02:22:18.616 --> 02:22:19.616
Can you imagine?

02:22:19.616 --> 02:22:20.616
Nobody has a matchbox.

02:22:20.616 --> 02:22:24.416
Is such a problem with thousands of people
there, nobody has matchbox.

02:22:24.416 --> 02:22:28.206
So we had to send somebody to get the matchbox.

02:22:28.206 --> 02:22:29.765
There's no need.

02:22:29.765 --> 02:22:32.725
So I never say, "Don't do this," never.

02:22:32.725 --> 02:22:38.005
I've never said it but it has worked like
that, it has worked.

02:22:38.005 --> 02:22:43.636
I don't know how, how you have dropped it
but it's very simple when the light of the

02:22:43.636 --> 02:22:45.285
spirit is there.

02:22:45.285 --> 02:22:49.566
In that light, you just don't.

02:22:49.566 --> 02:22:53.956
Now all the people have said, "Don't drink."

02:22:53.956 --> 02:23:01.255
Say for example: Sikhs, Muslims but you see
they all drink because they are not really

02:23:01.255 --> 02:23:03.906
Muslims, they are not really Sikhs.

02:23:03.906 --> 02:23:06.456
If they were really that, they would not have
drunk.

02:23:06.456 --> 02:23:10.495
How is it possible then?

02:23:10.495 --> 02:23:12.326
They have to be the spirit.

02:23:12.326 --> 02:23:17.846
In the light of the spirit, we just don't
do anything that is destructive, just don't

02:23:17.846 --> 02:23:18.846
do it.

02:23:18.846 --> 02:23:20.136
You don't have to tell anybody.

02:23:20.136 --> 02:23:25.296
Now you are all sitting here, you know that
I've never told you anyone, "Don't do this."

02:23:25.296 --> 02:23:31.156
But I was amazed in London that people overnight
gave up drugs, overnight.

02:23:31.156 --> 02:23:36.235
People employ military, this, that drugs is
[INAUDIBLE].

02:23:36.235 --> 02:23:37.785
They gave up prostitution.

02:23:37.785 --> 02:23:44.096
They gave (up) drugs, all kinds of destructive
things to which human being take sometimes

02:23:44.096 --> 02:23:50.226
out of frustration and sometimes because they
feel very lonely.

02:23:50.226 --> 02:23:54.376
But now in Sahaja Yoga, you can never be lonely.

02:23:54.376 --> 02:23:58.216
All over the world, you have brothers and
sisters.

02:23:58.216 --> 02:24:04.096
If they come to know somebody is there somebody
is coming, they'll all go to the airport to

02:24:04.096 --> 02:24:05.096
receive.

02:24:05.096 --> 02:24:10.776
It's not a brotherhood of a ordinary life.

02:24:10.776 --> 02:24:12.795
It's a very deep type of a brotherhood.

02:24:12.795 --> 02:24:15.446
It's a very deep understanding.

02:24:15.446 --> 02:24:19.975
But they are very deep people, I must say,
because they have been seekers and in that

02:24:19.975 --> 02:24:29.525
seeking they have really got completely into
a turmoil and that has made them very deep

02:24:29.525 --> 02:24:30.525
people.

02:24:30.525 --> 02:24:35.466
This book is "Light of Quran" is written by
a lady Gilmet.

02:24:35.466 --> 02:24:36.466
You read it.

02:24:36.466 --> 02:24:39.536
I would request you to read it because she
is so deep.

02:24:39.536 --> 02:24:46.735
I knew she was very deep but the way she has
expressed is so beautiful, so joy giving that

02:24:46.735 --> 02:24:52.606
she's not a Muslim, she married a Muslim,
so called, because they were all Sahaja yogis

02:24:52.606 --> 02:24:58.076
and the way she has narrated her seeking is
so beautiful.

02:24:58.076 --> 02:25:03.995
We have so many big writers in Sahaja Yoga
who have given very, very nice books and things.

02:25:03.995 --> 02:25:06.146
But this Gilmet is very shy.

02:25:06.146 --> 02:25:07.146
She doesn't talk.

02:25:07.146 --> 02:25:08.586
She keeps quiet.

02:25:08.586 --> 02:25:12.606
But inside, she's so deep because of her seeking.

02:25:12.606 --> 02:25:20.066
So there are many people in this world who
are seeking the truth because they cannot

02:25:20.066 --> 02:25:27.725
bear the nonsense of modern world and they
are very sensitive.

02:25:27.725 --> 02:25:30.045
They are not insensitive, very sensitive people.

02:25:30.045 --> 02:25:33.966
That's how you all got your realization.

02:25:33.966 --> 02:25:35.805
It's nothing of Mine.

02:25:35.805 --> 02:25:38.456
To say that "I did it," is not proper.

02:25:38.456 --> 02:25:44.076
If you were not like a candle, I could not
have enlightened you.

02:25:44.076 --> 02:25:46.035
So I am very thankful to you.

02:25:46.035 --> 02:25:53.235
And I am so much enamored by the way you people
are feeling about Sahaja Yoga: that collectively

02:25:53.235 --> 02:25:57.626
you have to work it out, globally you have
to work it out.

02:25:57.626 --> 02:26:01.226
You have to help each other and bring up the
people.

02:26:01.226 --> 02:26:09.346
Most important thing is to create a mind universally
which is towards the spirit.

02:26:09.346 --> 02:26:11.966
Then we'll solve all the problems, no problem.

02:26:11.966 --> 02:26:18.166
Now if I say I am starting some sort of a
project here for the poor.

02:26:18.166 --> 02:26:22.026
Immediately all of them will send Me money.

02:26:22.026 --> 02:26:23.026
Immediately they'll all work.

02:26:23.026 --> 02:26:27.106
They'll find out who can work it out, who
can come and help Mother.

02:26:27.106 --> 02:26:28.896
What work can we give them?

02:26:28.896 --> 02:26:32.176
How to work it out, all over the world.

02:26:32.176 --> 02:26:34.786
I mean, it spreads so fast.

02:26:34.786 --> 02:26:36.936
I have to just say that.

02:26:36.936 --> 02:26:38.566
I never asked for money.

02:26:38.566 --> 02:26:44.226
I never said, "I need money," but immediately
they will plan out the whole thing, bring

02:26:44.226 --> 02:26:46.706
the whole thing here and work it out.

02:26:46.706 --> 02:26:49.805
It can work in India, it can work anywhere.

02:26:49.805 --> 02:26:53.066
It's not just they are interested in India.

02:26:53.066 --> 02:26:56.416
But globally they are interested in the problems.

02:26:56.416 --> 02:27:03.965
It is not for making some sort of a show or
some sort of a, we can say, a cult.

02:27:03.965 --> 02:27:11.826
It is something which is very innate, which
is very subtle and that works, that gives

02:27:11.826 --> 02:27:12.956
them joy.

02:27:12.956 --> 02:27:16.456
That gives them joy to do something for Sahaja
Yoga.

02:27:16.456 --> 02:27:27.535
I am sometimes amazed how they feel for the
whole world, how they care for the whole world,

02:27:27.535 --> 02:27:29.106
how they are willing to do for [?].

02:27:29.106 --> 02:27:32.876
Of course as I said, every country has some
problems.

02:27:32.876 --> 02:27:41.376
Like, we can say that north Indians are interested
always in politics because Delhi is here.

02:27:41.376 --> 02:27:43.316
But is reduced now, very much reduced now.

02:27:43.316 --> 02:27:46.166
There's not much going on.

02:27:46.166 --> 02:27:49.126
And they don't like to hear anything against
anyone.

02:27:49.126 --> 02:27:50.846
That's a good thing.

02:27:50.846 --> 02:27:58.216
And in the south, we can say in the beyond
Narmada river, whatever we have, Maharashtra

02:27:58.216 --> 02:28:02.656
and all that, they are very ritualistic, very
ritualistic people.

02:28:02.656 --> 02:28:07.096
Even if they put the thali [thali MEANS PLATE
FOR DINING], you must put salt here, you must

02:28:07.096 --> 02:28:13.156
put vegetable here, you .. so that a blind
man can also eat food properly.

02:28:13.156 --> 02:28:15.096
You must use only one hand.

02:28:15.096 --> 02:28:16.775
You must keep another hand tied up.

02:28:16.775 --> 02:28:22.246
They're very, very ritualistic because of
these two things, you see, in Sahaja Yoga

02:28:22.246 --> 02:28:24.316
they do not grow.

02:28:24.316 --> 02:28:31.285
Whatever it is, we have to understand that
these are [lingering PROBABLY ?] still are

02:28:31.285 --> 02:28:32.285
behind us.

02:28:32.285 --> 02:28:37.806
For example in north India, I would say if
anybody speaks anything ill about anybody,

02:28:37.806 --> 02:28:38.986
just put your.

02:28:38.986 --> 02:28:41.936
This principle of Gandhiji was correct.

02:28:41.936 --> 02:28:45.356
Never listen to any nonsensical gossip.

02:28:45.356 --> 02:28:47.255
Gossip is going on.

02:28:47.255 --> 02:28:51.166
People like to listen to gossip because of
this media also.

02:28:51.166 --> 02:28:54.316
They were showing nothing but gossip before
election.

02:28:54.316 --> 02:28:58.735
And the whole gossip goes into our mind and
that's how we work out.

02:28:58.735 --> 02:29:04.965
So for this part, I would request all the
people from the north India to never to listen

02:29:04.965 --> 02:29:09.236
any criticism, never to criticize anyone.

02:29:09.236 --> 02:29:11.255
What is the use?

02:29:11.255 --> 02:29:17.146
Just see logically: if you listen to somebody's
criticism, what is the use?

02:29:17.146 --> 02:29:19.826
What do you gain out of it?

02:29:19.826 --> 02:29:25.446
Now by repeating it to somebody else, what
do you gain?

02:29:25.446 --> 02:29:26.446
What is the gain?

02:29:26.446 --> 02:29:32.126
Simple thing, always ask the question: What
is the gain?

02:29:32.126 --> 02:29:35.816
And why to see something wrong with others?

02:29:35.816 --> 02:29:38.816
I know by that you can be cheated.

02:29:38.816 --> 02:29:42.275
Somebody can deceive you, is true.

02:29:42.275 --> 02:29:44.416
But doesn't matter.

02:29:44.416 --> 02:29:46.816
You don't get anything into your head.

02:29:46.816 --> 02:29:50.975
You don't get any filth and any poison in
your head.

02:29:50.975 --> 02:29:57.025
I know there are people who create problem,
talk from one to another, do this, do that.

02:29:57.025 --> 02:30:03.305
But that should not harm you in anyway because
you have the spirit and the spirit cannot

02:30:03.305 --> 02:30:04.305
be harmed.

02:30:04.305 --> 02:30:05.316
It cannot be destroyed.

02:30:05.316 --> 02:30:09.586
It is said that, "It cannot be destroyed by
any weapon.

02:30:09.586 --> 02:30:12.255
It lives and lives forever."

02:30:12.255 --> 02:30:20.316
So the attention towards the atma is lacking,
atma vimukta.

02:30:20.316 --> 02:30:30.225
We, our eyes have gone, our attention is gone
to something away from the spirit and that's

02:30:30.225 --> 02:30:32.696
why all the problems are there.

02:30:32.696 --> 02:30:39.896
Once you are one with your spirit, it works.

02:30:39.896 --> 02:30:46.106
It works for you because it is in connection
with the God almighty.

02:30:46.106 --> 02:30:53.926
It is in connection with the all pervading
power, which works out everything.

02:30:53.926 --> 02:30:56.015
I know this all pervading power.

02:30:56.015 --> 02:31:01.116
It has showing so many miraculous photographs
about Me.

02:31:01.116 --> 02:31:05.196
And actually I, I didn't ask It but It is
doing.

02:31:05.196 --> 02:31:07.326
Because very active, It is very active.

02:31:07.326 --> 02:31:12.765
And if It sees anybody who is subtle and who
is deep, It acts.

02:31:12.765 --> 02:31:19.636
In your business, in your politics, in your
family in everywhere you'll find this light

02:31:19.636 --> 02:31:29.726
will shine and you'll respect, respect the
hearts of a person.

02:31:29.726 --> 02:31:32.406
You'll respect the love of others.

02:31:32.406 --> 02:31:37.616
You will respect the spirit that is shining
in others.

02:31:37.616 --> 02:31:44.846
This is the reason why you have learned to
respect each other, because your spirit is

02:31:44.846 --> 02:31:45.846
enlightened.

02:31:45.846 --> 02:31:46.846
I can see it so clearly.

02:31:46.846 --> 02:31:53.136
I am so very happy to see so many of you here
for My birthday.

02:31:53.136 --> 02:31:59.676
I don't know what is the significance of a
birthday is but whatever it is, it is one

02:31:59.676 --> 02:32:06.106
of the things that I can meet you, all of
you here, so very happy.

02:32:06.106 --> 02:32:11.525
I am thankful to these people who are elites
of our society.

02:32:11.525 --> 02:32:19.436
They are very great people elected and sometimes
given very high positions and also there are

02:32:19.436 --> 02:32:21.265
some very well known industrialists.

02:32:21.265 --> 02:32:29.116
All of them have to understand the value of
sprititual life.

02:32:29.116 --> 02:32:31.966
It's very important for them.

02:32:31.966 --> 02:32:41.555
Not to avoid this point but to be one with
your spirit is your own property, is in your

02:32:41.555 --> 02:32:50.126
own, I should say, the complete glory that
you have is to be the spirit.

02:32:50.126 --> 02:32:56.735
With all this, I don't know how to thank you
all and how to thank all these people who

02:32:56.735 --> 02:32:59.386
spoke so nicely.

02:32:59.386 --> 02:33:06.846
Only thing, I wish you all a great growth
in your spiritual life atmonnati, into your

02:33:06.846 --> 02:33:15.596
spirituality so that it covers all the corners
of the world and create a beautiful world

02:33:15.596 --> 02:33:16.596
of tomorrow.

02:33:16.596 --> 02:33:18.326
May God bless you!
