00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:15.652
About the Mantras I must tell you that it’s a big science
and one should know how to take Mantra, what time, where.

00:00:15.772 --> 00:00:21.420
You cannot give a general Mantra to everyone, like a general
medicine.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:28.551
The Mantra is according to the way Kundalini is moving.

00:00:28.631 --> 00:00:32.912
Say the Kundalini has stopped here, then
you have to name, take the name of Christ

00:00:33.032 --> 00:00:36.826
or you have to say the Mantra of “Lord’s Prayer”.

00:00:36.946 --> 00:00:40.893
Now if it stops in the stomach, 
you have to take the name of Vishnu.

00:00:40.987 --> 00:00:49.371
If it stops around the Void then you have to take the
name of these primordial Masters like Mohammed or

00:00:49.491 --> 00:00:53.191
like other People like Moses, Abraham.

00:00:53.311 --> 00:00:56.686
If it stops here you have to take the name of Shri Krishna

00:00:56.806 --> 00:01:01.676
or you have to say “Allah hu Akbar” 
with these fingers in your ears

00:01:01.796 --> 00:01:04.535
and that’s how you can cure your throat-troubles.

00:01:04.622 --> 00:01:10.129
These are all Mantras, but not like
everybody stupidly saying “Allah hu Akbar”

00:01:10.275 --> 00:01:14.865
or everybody saying some Mantra
which has no relation to that person.

00:01:14.985 --> 00:01:19.083
And before realization you have
no authority to take any Mantras.

00:01:19.203 --> 00:01:26.264
Like if I have to meet – supposing – the
Prime-Minister then I have to go through proper channel,

00:01:26.384 --> 00:01:31.074
there is a protocol, I cannot just go and shout
his Names somewhere, ah they will arrest Me.

00:01:31.154 --> 00:01:36.167
Now God is the Prime-Minister of all the Prime-Ministers,

00:01:36.293 --> 00:01:41.022
He is the highest of all, so taking
His name is not such a simple thing,

00:01:41.142 --> 00:01:45.632
that anybody can take His name,
just call Him as if He is your servant.

00:01:45.712 --> 00:01:47.845
And the way we pray sometimes, you see:

00:01:47.965 --> 00:01:53.414
look after my father, look after my mother,
look after my children, look after everyone,

00:01:53.534 --> 00:01:55.931
that’s not the way to address God.

00:01:56.011 --> 00:02:01.249
First you have to get your realization and enter
into the Kingdom of God, then He looks after you.

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.735
Then He looks after you fully, in every way.

00:02:07.683 --> 00:02:11.642
You see in Sahaja Yoga you are not given any mantra or anything.

00:02:11.723 --> 00:02:15.239
There is no, nothing like giving you into a big course.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.522
Like teaching you one after another any mantra or anything.
It's not like this.

00:02:19.603 --> 00:02:23.562
What you have to know, where the Kundalini is, how it is moving?

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:27.802
Where it is ? What is the Chakra catching?
and what is the mantra for that?

00:02:27.883 --> 00:02:32.452
It doesn’t take anything, hardly takes about a week.
For you to understand the whole thing.

00:02:32.533 --> 00:02:35.362
But gradually as you start moving it, you become proficient.

00:02:35.443 --> 00:02:38.414
Then you can know, how to do it for yourself and for others.

00:02:38.495 --> 00:02:42.256
There is not much of a thing like a child,

00:02:42.342 --> 00:02:46.634
when he comes up a little age,
it starts picking up language.

00:02:46.715 --> 00:02:52.004
Because he has built in capacity, 
to create sound. And he does it.

00:02:52.084 --> 00:02:57.014
In the same way, once you get it,
when you get the cool breeze in your hand,

00:02:57.101 --> 00:02:59.767
you learn it by using it.

00:02:59.847 --> 00:03:04.712
You understand it, yourself.
You become yourself quite proficient

00:03:04.793 --> 00:03:07.593
And you will be amazed, how fast you learn this.

00:03:07.674 --> 00:03:11.661
You don't have to learn it just like a science book or anything.

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:14.576
Just start learning with: 
"This is the chakra, it is catching"

00:03:14.657 --> 00:03:17.314
Because now, for example this chakra is catching.

00:03:17.395 --> 00:03:21.074
Right side, now there is a mantra 
for this is of Shri Krishna.

00:03:21.155 --> 00:03:23.214
Say this chakra is catching,

00:03:23.295 --> 00:03:27.368
Here, then this the mantra for Jesus Christ.

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:30.728
Like that you must know, the mantras and the chakras.

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:35.108
But the chakras you just know as a absolutely a knowledge.

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:37.882
Which is built in your nerves.

00:03:37.963 --> 00:03:39.623
Just feel it!

00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:43.578
[Yogi] … about mantras…

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:47.419
Mantras, yes. Now, we have got different centers,

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:50.622
and all these centers have got different deities.

00:03:50.703 --> 00:03:53.258
As I told you, Lord Jesus Christ is here.,

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:57.859
Moses is here, Krishna is here. We have a chart of that.

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:00.827
We have books which will be given to you.

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:05.544
So the mantras are according to the chakra that is in problem.

00:04:05.624 --> 00:04:08.624
Supposing your Nabhi chakra is not alright. Alright?

00:04:08.744 --> 00:04:11.864
And if you start saying the mantra of this one is no use.

00:04:11.984 --> 00:04:15.704
So you must know what center is catching, from your fingers.

00:04:15.824 --> 00:04:19.304
Now you can make out here, in this chart if you see

00:04:19.424 --> 00:04:25.275
on this side, we have got written the numbers according to the centers.

00:04:25.356 --> 00:04:28.544
On this side, if you see it clearly?

00:04:28.664 --> 00:04:31.544
Now these are the numbers of the centers, alright?

00:04:31.664 --> 00:04:35.024
So then, and also here it is written in this chart,

00:04:35.144 --> 00:04:38.344
what are the different deities.

00:04:38.464 --> 00:04:41.584
Now, all these deities should be first understood,

00:04:41.704 --> 00:04:44.384
where are they, and when you have to say the mantras,

00:04:44.504 --> 00:04:50.384
what you have to do is coil it into a proper Sahaja Yoga mantra

00:04:50.504 --> 00:04:51.904
– so have you given that?

00:04:52.024 --> 00:04:53.504
[Yogi] It’s not in these books..

00:04:53.624 --> 00:04:54.824
But they will tell you.

00:04:54.944 --> 00:04:59.304
The pattern has to be like this, which says,

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:03.304
whatever is the thing is, is woven into the complete

00:05:03.424 --> 00:05:06.544
- I mean, you are to be recommended, isn’t it? 
Somebody has to say.

00:05:06.664 --> 00:05:13.624
So you have to say that
I am the one who has given you this knowledge.

00:05:13.744 --> 00:05:16.264
So just you have to use that particular thing

00:05:16.345 --> 00:05:19.104
which they will give you, the pattern, which is very simple.

00:05:19.224 --> 00:05:26.624
And you have to use these names of these deities, 
different deities

00:05:26.744 --> 00:05:30.704
according, and gradually you’ll be amazed it will work out.

00:05:30.817 --> 00:05:35.498
But when you come here, they will
tell you, it’s very simple, it’s very simple.

00:05:38.636 --> 00:05:43.486
Now we have got mantras for different chakras.

00:05:44.773 --> 00:05:50.512
Every chakra has got a mantra which you
know. If you do not know, you should find out.

00:05:50.593 --> 00:05:56.516
Now, if one chakra is catching,
then you work on that chakra only

00:05:56.596 --> 00:05:58.836
and develop your mantra on that.

00:05:58.916 --> 00:06:03.056
For example, supposing you have
to say something for your heart:

00:06:03.136 --> 00:06:06.544
then, first of all, you must ask for forgiveness from God.

00:06:06.624 --> 00:06:11.209
That means your attention has not been 
so much as it should have been on the Spirit.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:16.524
Or, if you have done any mistakes, ask for forgiveness,
you ask for forgiveness.

00:06:16.604 --> 00:06:19.944
Now, you ask for forgiveness from your heart.

00:06:20.024 --> 00:06:23.031
Even doing with hand can be artificial, you understand that?

00:06:23.112 --> 00:06:26.306
It could be just ritualistic – but from your heart.

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:29.847
Whatever you have to say, you say it from your heart.

00:06:29.927 --> 00:06:34.054
Ask for forgiveness from your heart, not [to] think about it.

00:06:34.134 --> 00:06:38.354
You see, this is the trouble. If I say something then you start thinking about it,

00:06:38.434 --> 00:06:42.008
and then you said then, “Now, I have to
take out my attention from the centre,”

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:46.896
and then you start taking out your attention. You cannot.

00:06:46.976 --> 00:06:50.849
With your brain, you cannot take out your attention from
anywhere.

00:06:50.929 --> 00:06:54.013
It’s only through your hands, or movement of your hands,

00:06:54.094 --> 00:06:59.658
or by saying mantras you bring in. 
Do you understand that point? Absolutely clear-cut.

00:06:59.739 --> 00:07:06.971
Many people think that if they pay attention 
to something and pull their attention – you cannot.

00:07:07.111 --> 00:07:10.071
But what you can do is to, when you are saying the mantra,

00:07:10.151 --> 00:07:14.465
put your attention, without
thought, to that particular chakra.

00:07:14.545 --> 00:07:16.632
So you master that chakra ultimately.

00:07:16.712 --> 00:07:20.877
The one which is a weakness can become your mastery.

00:07:23.153 --> 00:07:26.993
But if you think, then you are catching again the heart much more.

00:07:30.176 --> 00:07:34.712
Those who think that by saying mantras morning till evening

00:07:34.792 --> 00:07:39.901
they are going to achieve much, they are sadly mistaken; it's all mechanical then.

00:07:39.981 --> 00:07:45.210
So many people have a habit of all the time shouting mantras. It's not habit.

00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:49.231
Mantras should open your chakras, otherwise, it has no meaning.

00:07:49.312 --> 00:07:53.661
They should be used properly at key points,

00:07:53.742 --> 00:07:59.408
with great respect, with a great understanding, and then allow them

00:07:59.489 --> 00:08:03.899
to open your chakras, by which you take the water in

00:08:03.979 --> 00:08:07.338
of that great thing known as Kundalini.

00:08:07.418 --> 00:08:11.542
The greatest blessing will come to you through Her love.

00:08:11.622 --> 00:08:15.823
But not the way, people are just taking there should be no transformation.

00:08:15.904 --> 00:08:19.134
If you are identified with your ego and think oh, you are all right,

00:08:19.215 --> 00:08:21.741
you are sadly mistaken.

00:08:21.822 --> 00:08:24.821
You have to transform completely within yourself.

00:08:27.715 --> 00:08:34.527
So apart from this technique, to have the best effect of the blessings

00:08:34.608 --> 00:08:42.962
or the best flow of the Grace within us,
we say mantras.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.833
The sound of mantras,

00:09:00.523 --> 00:09:04.329
the sound, the sound echoes

00:09:04.443 --> 00:09:09.038
into the being of God.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:18.330
And they are re-echoed on our chakras,

00:09:21.559 --> 00:09:24.959
and then the chakras start opening more.

00:09:29.359 --> 00:09:33.839
So the flow of the Grace of God is received.

00:09:37.861 --> 00:09:41.661
But only a realized soul should chant a mantra.

00:09:46.167 --> 00:09:50.407
Because without connection, how will it reach God?

00:09:54.745 --> 00:09:56.545
It is a vicious circle.

00:09:58.562 --> 00:10:02.201
Now one may say that "Mother, you cannot get realization

00:10:02.282 --> 00:10:05.187
unless and until you get the Grace of God.

00:10:12.573 --> 00:10:17.734
And the chakras won't open by a person
who is not a realized soul.

00:10:23.057 --> 00:10:26.357
And without opening the chakras you cannot get realization."

00:10:30.262 --> 00:10:35.003
That's how the play of the Mother comes in,

00:10:38.789 --> 00:10:41.995
and of all the saints, like you.

00:10:45.527 --> 00:10:51.127
I would say the Sahaja yogis have to break this vicious circle.

00:10:57.151 --> 00:11:00.271
You have to raise the kundalini yourself.

00:11:04.072 --> 00:11:09.228
Once you raise the kundalini, 
the kundalini opens the chakras a little bit,

00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:17.675
because you have given your vibrations to the chakras.

00:11:21.395 --> 00:11:24.555
So once she knows there is a Sahaja yogi standing

00:11:24.688 --> 00:11:28.168
behind the seeker, she rises.

00:11:39.114 --> 00:11:42.194
She knows you are her brothers and sisters,

00:11:47.914 --> 00:11:51.354
and that you belong to the same family as she does.

00:11:57.925 --> 00:12:00.691
She knows the land where she has to grow, you see,

00:12:00.772 --> 00:12:05.052
so she can feel that, and then she rises in her dignity.

00:12:11.402 --> 00:12:14.082
That's how she breaks this vicious circle.
