00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.800
Now raise your Kundalini. All of you raise
your Kundalini and tie it up so that it's

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.380
up there. Just raise it like that. No. This
way. This way you should do it. This way.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.050
It's good. Once more.

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.309
In the West, you have grown very big outside,

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.240
like a tree has grown very big. But it must
find its roots, otherwise the whole tree can

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.500
fall off, without nutrition. So you must know
the knowledge of the roots.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.289
Without the knowledge of the roots, the tree

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:34.289
has no meaning. So this may be a little new
thing for you to understand, but you must

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:39.649
know ... to know the knowledge of the roots
you have to become subtle. If you are not

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.660
a subtle personality you cannot enter into
your roots and you cannot understand what

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:51.660
lies in there. So, first of all, I said yesterday,
you all should get your Realisation, and after

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.580
your Realisation you can understand this better
than anything else.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.209
Christ came on this earth, but he was only

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:07.830
allowed to preach and talk for three and a
half years of his life time. And in tree and

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:14.090
a half years is nothing. In that, whatever
was possible he said positively, he told about

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.360
the future, all that was to happen. He didn't
talk much about the Holy Ghost. The reason

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.960
was His Mother was the Holy Ghost at that
time and He didn't want to talk about Her

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:32.960
because the attention of the people would
be on Her and they would have killed Her.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.920
And then he has got eleven destroying powers.
And he would have used those eleven destroying

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.840
powers and everything would have been finished,
the whole drama would have been finished.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.310
So He did not mention much about the Holy
Ghost and did not (expect / express / exaplain?)

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.710
But logically we must understand that we talk
of the Father and of the Son but not of the

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.810
Mother.
How can you have a father and a son and no

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.069
mother? That's an impossibility. So, Holy
Ghost is the Primordial Mother.

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.480
In the sanskrit language if you go - because
in the Bible you cannot find everything about

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.680
Christ, it's very (little/literal) - but you
have to go back about 1400 years back, back

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.319
in India people have prophesied about Him,
how He will be coming. And about the Primordial

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.440
Mother who was called as Adi Shakti who was
the Holy Ghost.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.020
All description was given and when Her advent
will come what will happen and how to recognize

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.600
her.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:39.240
All this is described very well so many
years back, even about Christ, quite a lot

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.630
to described and also we are going to read
it out to you, the translation of what is

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:51.630
written about Christ and then there is a complete
description about His origin, how He came

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.840
on this earth and what was the purpose of
His life.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.840
(Ask that gentlemen to come inside. Can
you ? This gentlemen, come inside. You sit

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.920
comfortably)

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.540
4:02 And what was the purpose of His life
and how He has to establish in this centre

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.709
here (pointing to the Agya Chakra), and that
by establishing there he can suck the ego

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:20.709
and superego in you and how He takes you away,
or He washes off your karmas and your conditionings.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.530
All that has been described very well in the
Devi Mahatmya book out of which we are just

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.150
going to read a little bit to you about the
adoration.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.629
So Bible cannot contain Christ, because Christ
is Chaitanya, He is Omkara, He is the Logos

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:43.629
as we call Him. He is the Power, and you cannot
describe Him in one little book, when He was

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:49.289
here only for three and a half years and the
people who saw him also were his disciples,

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:54.659
they did not know much about Him. Until he
was resurrected they did not believe Him and

00:04:54.659 --> 00:05:01.139
even after His death, I mean His resurrection,
Matthew and all these people were quite disturbed

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:07.779
and upset because you know they were all persecuted
and they, somehow or the other, wanted to

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:10.889
continue the message of Christ in a very secretive
manner.

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:17.889
So today the time has come for you to
know about Him, about what He was - in the

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.460
Heaven and how He came on this Earth. All
that we don't have time today but we'll be

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.710
just telling you about a little passage that
is written about him.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:35.710
So first, He is the one who is innocence,
who is an eternal child, and He appears first

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.770
on the first chakra of Muladhara, and there
He's called as Shri Ganesh. Where the carbon

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:48.770
atom was made. Carbon. And that is very important
to understand that Ganesha is the symbol of

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:56.629
innocence and Mother Earth is the power of
that deity, Ganesha.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:04.270
So it was Ganesha, later on incarnated
on this Earth as Christ, and He will be incarnated

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:11.279
again as eleven Rudras, means Ekadashas, or
we can call him as Nishkalanka deity, when

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:17.919
He will just sort out things in a sense that
He will just cut the people out who are not

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:24.919
realised, who are no good, and the rest of
them will ascend in the Kingdom of Heaven,

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.050
this is what is the last Ascent.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.369
Now, for this ...

00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:32.919
Please sit down, please. Please be seated,
give him a chair or something. You have to

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:38.289
sit down comfortably. You see, it is a thing
that makes... happen something within you,

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:43.069
so you have to be very much restful, that's
very important. Give him a chair if he cannot

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:49.300
sit on the ground. Give him a chair, but be
comfortable otherwise it won't work out, you

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.520
see, it is not something that will go into
your mind, it's something that will go to

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.669
your being, so you have to be very receptive.

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:57.439
Another thing I'll tell you, yesterday also

00:06:57.439 --> 00:07:03.839
I saw, and today also, you should not move
your neck by eating something or chewing something

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:09.680
because this Vishuddhi chakra gets upset at
that time. So keep still, unless and until

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.509
you are still it cannot work out. So please
keep still.

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:16.240
So this is the nourishment of the roots of

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.810
which we are going to work out, which you
will feel it, very nicely within yourself.
