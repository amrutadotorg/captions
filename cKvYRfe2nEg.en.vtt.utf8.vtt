WEBVTT

00:02.590 --> 00:16.609
[Music]

00:16.620 --> 00:22.300
so now the other Center which we have

00:19.360 --> 00:25.090
here is very important center call as

00:22.300 --> 00:26.200
the vishuddhi chakra this is the center

00:25.090 --> 00:29.140
we shoot them

00:26.200 --> 00:32.980
one is shoot them in spoon but we should

00:29.140 --> 00:36.430
the means absolutely pure this has got

00:32.980 --> 00:39.760
60 patterns as we have got the cervical

00:36.430 --> 00:42.790
plexus expressed the gross which has

00:39.760 --> 00:44.980
also got sixteen sub-plexuses

00:42.790 --> 00:50.740
it tallies with medical science

00:44.980 --> 00:53.500
completely now let us see how is

00:50.740 --> 00:57.790
vishuddhi chakra maintains all the

00:53.500 --> 01:04.089
baubles that he used governorship

00:57.790 --> 01:06.690
teacher and like in Devanagari language

01:04.089 --> 01:09.870
duties ah

01:06.690 --> 01:09.870
[Music]

01:14.900 --> 01:22.110
aha so as you know that you cannot come

01:19.740 --> 01:29.810
by the word without a moment it's so

01:22.110 --> 01:34.110
important the consonant is weak without

01:29.810 --> 01:41.700
near but without any stay without the

01:34.110 --> 01:43.590
wall so the strength of a person comes

01:41.700 --> 01:47.940
through the vishuddhi chakra in his

01:43.590 --> 01:50.280
speech it's the center what we call here

01:47.940 --> 01:53.520
is the vishuddhi chakra is the center

01:50.280 --> 01:56.220
where human beings raise their head up

01:53.520 --> 01:58.740
this is the center that has made us a

01:56.220 --> 02:02.250
human being and from this Center only

01:58.740 --> 02:05.430
Rises the ego and superego because this

02:02.250 --> 02:08.039
is the center of collectivity because we

02:05.430 --> 02:10.170
speak through the center we talk through

02:08.039 --> 02:12.209
this we have rapport with other people

02:10.170 --> 02:16.410
through this and as a reaction to that

02:12.209 --> 02:18.930
ego and superego is built within us when

02:16.410 --> 02:23.700
that is built within us we become a

02:18.930 --> 02:25.830
personality I am some he is some you are

02:23.700 --> 02:32.519
some at that point

02:25.830 --> 02:36.840
we become a person who has the

02:32.519 --> 02:40.350
consciousness of ilus like then I say I

02:36.840 --> 02:42.600
like this I want this say I will say I

02:40.350 --> 02:45.329
am an Indian you will say I'm an

02:42.600 --> 02:48.120
Englishman all these misidentifications

02:45.329 --> 02:51.060
start because you become an individual

02:48.120 --> 02:55.560
who tries to identify with many things

02:51.060 --> 02:59.549
that's how we become separated from that

02:55.560 --> 03:03.209
power this is the freedom we get where

02:59.549 --> 03:05.700
we have to ourself learn from our errors

03:03.209 --> 03:09.180
and trials what is right and what is

03:05.700 --> 03:11.910
wrong this vishuddhi chakra is has got

03:09.180 --> 03:15.650
sixteen petals and looks after our ear

03:11.910 --> 03:18.540
nose eyes throat everything our face

03:15.650 --> 03:21.150
everything is looked after by descent

03:18.540 --> 03:22.660
now this Center also has left and right

03:21.150 --> 03:27.160
all centers have left and

03:22.660 --> 03:29.590
and when you feel guilty the left Center

03:27.160 --> 03:31.840
gadgets which is a very dangerous thing

03:29.590 --> 03:34.540
because this gives you diseases like

03:31.840 --> 03:35.830
angina or maybe diseases like

03:34.540 --> 03:39.550
spondylitis

03:35.830 --> 03:40.870
and lethargic organs right when a person

03:39.550 --> 03:43.570
is very aggressive talks very

03:40.870 --> 03:48.820
aggressively and tries to dominate

03:43.570 --> 03:51.610
others and use his power of speech to

03:48.820 --> 03:53.500
show off the right side catches the the

03:51.610 --> 03:56.980
reactions of this can be many that the

03:53.500 --> 03:59.260
hand gets frozen and they also get the

03:56.980 --> 04:02.890
cancer of the throat all kinds of things

03:59.260 --> 04:04.540
can happen with this chakra being in

04:02.890 --> 04:09.780
Japan

04:04.540 --> 04:09.780
[Music]

04:12.740 --> 04:23.490
now a person who shouts and screams and

04:17.270 --> 04:27.210
talks loudly and loses is tempered in a

04:23.490 --> 04:31.320
very loud voice or who speaks very

04:27.210 --> 04:35.330
loudly all the time they all suffer from

04:31.320 --> 04:38.730
the right wishes so one should

04:35.330 --> 04:40.950
understand that even when you have to

04:38.730 --> 04:42.540
score somebody you have to just say what

04:40.950 --> 04:43.290
are you doing why are you doing like

04:42.540 --> 04:47.280
this

04:43.290 --> 04:52.860
otherwise why oh it's finished I'd push

04:47.280 --> 04:56.790
it over finished now this is the things

04:52.860 --> 05:00.950
on the right side if you are talking

04:56.790 --> 05:05.750
loudly if you talk too much

05:00.950 --> 05:09.360
if you intimidate people with your

05:05.750 --> 05:12.330
talking then you catch on right

05:09.360 --> 05:15.330
vishuddhi so for that best is to take

05:12.330 --> 05:18.270
some rest and give some rest - you're

05:15.330 --> 05:22.250
right we should be by stopping your talk

05:18.270 --> 05:25.350
go into mana they said just don't talk

05:22.250 --> 05:27.060
for some time if you don't have you'll

05:25.350 --> 05:30.000
see that where we should be will be

05:27.060 --> 05:34.110
improved your problems will be in - so

05:30.000 --> 05:36.570
what is the divine diplomacy you don't

05:34.110 --> 05:45.390
have to shout but you change the subject

05:36.570 --> 05:48.330
if you want to bring somebody to a some

05:45.390 --> 05:51.450
conclusion the best thing is first you

05:48.330 --> 05:53.670
change the subject and gradually if you

05:51.450 --> 05:57.590
are clever enough then you go on

05:53.670 --> 06:01.650
changing changing and you bring it back

05:57.590 --> 06:04.430
to the right thing that's the clever

06:01.650 --> 06:04.430
thing to do

06:06.090 --> 06:11.419
what is the essence of this diplomacy

06:17.030 --> 06:27.240
its benevolence you have to achieve the

06:21.870 --> 06:30.030
benevolence of the whole humanity this

06:27.240 --> 06:32.280
is the essence of it if you are doing it

06:30.030 --> 06:34.110
you are not doing for yourself for your

06:32.280 --> 06:36.389
game you are not doing for the gain of

06:34.110 --> 06:40.169
any particular person but you are doing

06:36.389 --> 06:43.290
it for the benefits of the whole

06:40.169 --> 06:47.070
humanity so once you know this is the

06:43.290 --> 06:48.600
essence so what is the need to shout by

06:47.070 --> 06:51.780
shouting you are not going to achieve

06:48.600 --> 06:53.660
anything so to play around with it and

06:51.780 --> 06:58.620
bring it to that point which is

06:53.660 --> 07:06.260
benevolence so our right we should be we

06:58.620 --> 07:10.410
have to have a temperament a culture a

07:06.260 --> 07:12.780
style a behavior which has got the

07:10.410 --> 07:17.220
quality which is called as midoriya

07:12.780 --> 07:20.340
means melodious melodious you should

07:17.220 --> 07:24.419
talk in such a manner that it should be

07:20.340 --> 07:27.780
melodious the voice of a sahaja yogi

07:24.419 --> 07:32.060
should be sweet like that when you talk

07:27.780 --> 07:35.580
to someone it should be melodies

07:32.060 --> 07:38.130
it should not be aggressive at all but

07:35.580 --> 07:41.340
on the contrary it should be melodious

07:38.130 --> 07:44.880
it should not be sarcastic it should not

07:41.340 --> 07:48.870
hurt another person any word that hurts

07:44.880 --> 07:52.680
others cannot be coming from the proper

07:48.870 --> 07:58.320
type of rightfully so in no way one

07:52.680 --> 08:01.560
should hurt the another quality which we

07:58.320 --> 08:05.700
can express through our right we should

08:01.560 --> 08:08.310
ease diplomacy but there are two types

08:05.700 --> 08:12.020
of diplomacy's one is genuine one is

08:08.310 --> 08:15.330
artificial in the genuine diplomacy you

08:12.020 --> 08:18.599
do not have to take to a certain

08:15.330 --> 08:19.430
standard or you don't have to read some

08:18.599 --> 08:23.660
books

08:19.430 --> 08:27.230
to know how it is diplomacy is it

08:23.660 --> 08:31.640
genuinely it comes to you it the whole

08:27.230 --> 08:35.600
thing works very sweetly in such a

08:31.640 --> 08:38.720
genuine manner I have used it many a

08:35.600 --> 08:41.360
times myself and you all can use it also

08:38.720 --> 08:44.480
many a time that's only possible if you

08:41.360 --> 08:46.630
don't get angry with not possible if you

08:44.480 --> 08:46.630
are

08:47.380 --> 08:57.880
[Music]

08:55.890 --> 09:00.220
relationship between brothers and

08:57.880 --> 09:03.580
sisters have to be established a very

09:00.220 --> 09:09.070
pure brothers and sisters relationship

09:03.580 --> 09:11.740
is without any lust or greed it's pure

09:09.070 --> 09:15.900
relationship where the sister prays for

09:11.740 --> 09:22.240
the protection of the brother and

09:15.900 --> 09:24.060
brother play pray praise for the

09:22.240 --> 09:31.120
self-sufficiency

09:24.060 --> 09:33.580
now the Chima will be of the system so

09:31.120 --> 09:37.410
this time you have to think of your

09:33.580 --> 09:41.650
other sahaja Yogi's and sahaja Yogi's

09:37.410 --> 09:45.220
who are like your brothers and sisters

09:41.650 --> 09:49.570
you have to think like that purify your

09:45.220 --> 09:50.980
hearts something funny in this countries

09:49.570 --> 09:55.870
you know that there's no such

09:50.980 --> 09:56.440
relationship bases purify your mind

09:55.870 --> 10:00.279
today

09:56.440 --> 10:04.980
on that point that everybody else is my

10:00.279 --> 10:08.170
brother or sister if you have married

10:04.980 --> 10:11.020
but look at everyone try to look at

10:08.170 --> 10:19.029
everyone as a brother and a sister when

10:11.020 --> 10:24.750
the sister who is your pure relation is

10:19.029 --> 10:31.170
not treated as a sister when the

10:24.750 --> 10:35.500
attitude of a person towards women is of

10:31.170 --> 10:39.370
indulgence and of lust then he develops

10:35.500 --> 10:43.180
the left with you when he develops her

10:39.370 --> 10:46.990
left we should be very strongly and if

10:43.180 --> 10:49.630
he has a bad Agia or affairs eyes which

10:46.990 --> 10:53.110
are roving eyes then this left vishuddhi

10:49.630 --> 10:56.110
causes a lot of trouble left vishuddhi

10:53.110 --> 10:57.760
cannot be also caused by as you know by

10:56.110 --> 11:02.620
feeling guilty about things for nothing

10:57.760 --> 11:03.890
at all all these problems arise from

11:02.620 --> 11:08.149
issues

11:03.890 --> 11:15.890
the left side Center is what up when a

11:08.149 --> 11:21.620
person feels guilty and obstruct the

11:15.890 --> 11:24.019
scent of the Kundalini that's why I

11:21.620 --> 11:28.399
always request all the Western seekers

11:24.019 --> 11:38.149
first to say in their hearts mother I am

11:28.399 --> 11:43.940
NOT GUILTY these are the conditionings

11:38.149 --> 11:45.640
that have come to us from so-called

11:43.940 --> 11:50.300
religions

11:45.640 --> 11:52.700
from so-called psychologists and other

11:50.300 --> 12:00.260
people who are responsible for our

11:52.700 --> 12:03.050
development in our childhood when

12:00.260 --> 12:10.100
material things very important for the

12:03.050 --> 12:11.870
parents they all the time shout at

12:10.100 --> 12:14.240
children or correct them saying that

12:11.870 --> 12:17.380
don't spoil the carpet don't spoil that

12:14.240 --> 12:17.380
don't spoil that

12:22.050 --> 12:32.410
and that is how we develop a kind of a

12:26.350 --> 12:35.050
guilt within us when we grow up in the

12:32.410 --> 12:45.340
schools and colleges this can be built

12:35.050 --> 12:50.530
up very heavily within us - so how much

12:45.340 --> 12:54.400
important it is to understand the value

12:50.530 --> 12:57.610
of left which all of us catch on left

12:54.400 --> 12:59.530
which is D and we do not think that it

12:57.610 --> 13:01.120
is such an important thing where is your

12:59.530 --> 13:04.000
left Rashida catching means I am feeling

13:01.120 --> 13:05.470
guilty we do not understand that what

13:04.000 --> 13:09.790
have I done I have crossed the limits

13:05.470 --> 13:13.000
that's why he's showing there I have

13:09.790 --> 13:16.060
neglected some kind of a morality I have

13:13.000 --> 13:18.820
gone on a wrong path against mother and

13:16.060 --> 13:21.430
father that's why I left we should be

13:18.820 --> 13:25.330
sketching left switch we should be is

13:21.430 --> 13:28.780
the indication of the mistakes of the

13:25.330 --> 13:30.940
wrongs of the sins we can't afford to

13:28.780 --> 13:34.450
have left to shooting sahaja Yogi's

13:30.940 --> 13:37.030
cannot afford to have left now what I

13:34.450 --> 13:42.280
have seen that when this negativity

13:37.030 --> 13:45.100
starts acting people instead of facing

13:42.280 --> 13:46.840
it facing the mistakes that I am wrong I

13:45.100 --> 13:49.200
should not have done it it's a wrong

13:46.840 --> 13:52.240
thing to do start giving explanations

13:49.200 --> 13:54.670
once you start giving explanation this

13:52.240 --> 14:00.330
left vishudhi starts becoming like a

13:54.670 --> 14:03.190
bloated big lump and then there's no

14:00.330 --> 14:05.470
possibility of curing no possibility of

14:03.190 --> 14:08.470
cleansing so people start giving

14:05.470 --> 14:11.830
explanation why I did it why I do this

14:08.470 --> 14:13.570
once it is said it's wrong is wrong to

14:11.830 --> 14:17.850
be accepted all right next time I'm not

14:13.570 --> 14:17.850
going to do it I'm very sorry

14:18.630 --> 14:55.549
[Music]

14:52.480 --> 14:55.549
