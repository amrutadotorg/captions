00:00:00.524 --> 00:00:08.363
Sometimes the words fail to express

00:00:10.781 --> 00:00:18.658
the feelings of great gratitude for all
of you -

00:00:19.158 --> 00:00:23.682
for putting up this collective effort

00:00:23.883 --> 00:00:34.390
and such a beautiful concentrated work
as a real piece of art.

00:00:34.591 --> 00:00:41.273
I had seen “Magic Flute” long time back,
when I was in Berlin,

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:49.026
and that time – of course I didn’t
understand German language,

00:00:49.227 --> 00:00:58.131
but I absolutely got lost by the rhythm,
the music, the tuning and everything.

00:00:58.332 --> 00:01:03.124
So, actually the way you have brought
in that

00:01:03.325 --> 00:01:09.619
very, very beautiful piece of art to life –

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:16.286
I feel so much grateful to you that you are
all Sahaja Yogis,

00:01:16.487 --> 00:01:27.614
and to Sahaja Yogis to perform this kind
of magnificent, tremendous art piece,

00:01:27.815 --> 00:01:34.463
I don’t know whom to thank, really.
Because now I can see our future,

00:01:34.664 --> 00:01:40.393
we’ll be going all over the world,
taking this music.

00:01:40.594 --> 00:01:45.439
And may not be this one, may be
another one,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.836
but you are all such a great group that
you can really surpass everybody else

00:01:53.037 --> 00:01:57.177
who are having all these operas everywhere.

00:01:57.378 --> 00:02:02.286
Actually I would say in London it’s very
easy to get that hall

00:02:02.487 --> 00:02:07.234
which is mostly used for operas,
the Royal Albert Hall.

00:02:07.435 --> 00:02:13.980
So we can reserve for you that, and we’ll
have the whole thing done.

00:02:14.181 --> 00:02:20.495
I mean, I could never imagine that
you were such masters.

00:02:20.774 --> 00:02:25.755
I shouldn’t say professionals, but
really masters.

00:02:25.956 --> 00:02:31.849
And the way you all concentrated. This is
the main point of collective playing

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.345
is that there should be complete
concentration.

00:02:35.546 --> 00:02:40.922
I just wanted to test you, so I said,
“Sing also Binati Suniye”.

00:02:41.123 --> 00:02:44.387
But despite that you came back
to your normal

00:02:44.588 --> 00:02:48.120
and you were doing everything so well,
even after that;

00:02:48.321 --> 00:02:52.981
I don’t know how to congratulate you
and all of you

00:02:53.182 --> 00:03:02.758
who have taken to it, worked together,
in such unison and with such clarity.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:11.553
I must say, I would say it was even better
than the one I had seen, much better.

00:03:12.595 --> 00:03:19.148
You see, because I couldn’t even understand
the language, apart from that,

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:24.714
it was little they, I felt, they were
little confused comparatively,

00:03:24.915 --> 00:03:29.037
while you people were straight, absolutely
could see what you were doing,

00:03:29.238 --> 00:03:34.137
and what you were performing, and what
you were giving.

00:03:34.305 --> 00:03:38.070
Now I see your future, the future
of Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:38.271 --> 00:03:42.740
Through you people, the glory of Sahaja
Yoga will spread.

00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:48.399
But when we have the program we’ll have
all formal dresses and all formalities,

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.068
and I’m sure - I bless you from My heart -
that we’ll have the complete

00:03:53.269 --> 00:04:03.459
of this particular play by Mozart.
Complete.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.928
And we’ll do it so well, I know, and people
will know that what Sahaja Yoga can do

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:16.504
to your collectivity by which you can
achieve it – because this collectivity

00:04:16.705 --> 00:04:21.156
you can’t have in any other form
of performance.

00:04:21.357 --> 00:04:27.012
This has to be all of you, the players,
singers,

00:04:27.213 --> 00:04:31.088
then the dialogues and everything
has to be in unison.

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:37.111
In Maharashtra, in Marathi, we have dramas
of this kind,

00:04:37.312 --> 00:04:43.208
which can be called as operas, but apart
from that, there is lot of –

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:51.950
what you can say – dialogues which are not
in the tune or in the music form.

00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:56.832
So also they speak and tell you something
in between.

00:04:57.033 --> 00:05:04.922
But they are also very enjoyable and they
are thinking of having opera in Maharashtra.

00:05:05.123 --> 00:05:08.918
But now let – when they’ll see you then
I think they’ll give up the idea,

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:12.403
they can’t do that well, I’m sure.

00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:19.765
In any case Austria is a place, is the –
I think is the origin, is the distribution,

00:05:19.966 --> 00:05:27.547
is the complete sky of Western classical
music, no doubt about it.

00:05:27.748 --> 00:05:32.593
And you all are all really based into it.

00:05:32.794 --> 00:05:37.781
The way you have played and the way
you have sung

00:05:37.982 --> 00:05:41.254
is very remarkable, it has touched
My heart.

00:05:41.455 --> 00:05:46.946
I wish you had the complete seventy-five
minutes program,

00:05:47.147 --> 00:05:52.563
but the problem is that supposing you have
one day for this, then it’s all right.

00:05:52.764 --> 00:06:01.006
No, as it is, we have only two days in that
this cannot be fully expressed.

00:06:01.207 --> 00:06:07.272
But we’ll arrange a program, we’ll
definitely arrange a program

00:06:07.473 --> 00:06:11.222
in, say, Albert Hall I think, it’s easy
to get.

00:06:11.423 --> 00:06:14.262
I [mean] we get it every time, again
we’ll get this time.

00:06:14.463 --> 00:06:17.868
And I’m sure they will be very impressed.

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:23.511
Because they don’t know what music
you have in your country

00:06:23.712 --> 00:06:28.280
and how much people know and how much
they can sing so well.

00:06:28.481 --> 00:06:34.663
It’s something very rare, you don’t
understand, I feel it because

00:06:34.864 --> 00:06:40.012
I must say I’m not so much used to operas,

00:06:40.213 --> 00:06:45.207
and whatever operas I have seen, this is
thousand times better than that.

00:06:45.408 --> 00:06:50.281
So I’m really amazed at your achievement.
I don’t know if it is Sahaj Yog

00:06:50.482 --> 00:06:57.481
that has helped you, but this collective,
collective singing, is the biggest thing.

00:06:57.682 --> 00:07:00.887
Collective, in tune with all other
musicians,

00:07:01.088 --> 00:07:05.489
it’s really very, very great and this
unison, this oneness,

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:10.651
if it is through Sahaj Yog, I’m very happy
about it.

00:07:10.852 --> 00:07:15.657
We are all overly satisfied and I can see
your future –

00:07:15.858 --> 00:07:22.309
it will be a great future for all of you.
We shouldn’t take so much of botheration

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:28.469
about how we’ll do it and how will it work
out – it will, it will work out.

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:33.129
Your desire is much stronger than
the desire of any other artist.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:37.640
So just desire, it will all work out and
we’ll show to them

00:07:37.841 --> 00:07:43.241
how Sahaja Yoga can create such
beautiful music.

00:07:43.442 --> 00:07:50.026
So thank you very much, and I thank from
all others the way you have entertained us

00:07:50.227 --> 00:07:59.698
with this beautiful music and such great
hopes of a future expressions of your art.

00:07:59.899 --> 00:08:03.153
May God bless you.

00:08:06.675 --> 00:08:16.634
Then Slovakia people are also another
very great geniuses,

00:08:16.835 --> 00:08:23.101
yesterday we saw their drama and today
again we saw – I’m amazed absolutely.

00:08:23.302 --> 00:08:29.275
Is it Sahaja Yoga that has made them so
good in art? The creativity was so great

00:08:29.476 --> 00:08:36.470
and their play, drama was so beautiful.
So beautifully rendered;

00:08:36.671 --> 00:08:42.088
yesterday also, today also. I mean, they
are such dramatist I didn’t know, I mean,

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:48.167
how could they be that confident
of their acting and everything,

00:08:48.368 --> 00:08:53.608
is really remarkable. When I was young
I used to act also in dramas,

00:08:53.809 --> 00:09:01.016
and I used to get first prize mostly.
Maybe I quite

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:08.996
disguised Myself as something else,
but the, you see, the art,

00:09:09.197 --> 00:09:14.663
art of acting was so great even with them,

00:09:14.864 --> 00:09:19.716
I was surprised how they could freely
act so well.

00:09:19.917 --> 00:09:25.396
Again I would say if it is Sahaj Yog,
carry on, carry on with Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:25.597 --> 00:09:32.004
And I’m sure this creativity, the blessings
of Saraswati will be upon you;

00:09:32.205 --> 00:09:40.338
and we’ll have even bigger dramas
and bigger -

00:09:40.539 --> 00:09:46.628
we should say – expositions somewhere,
maybe later on

00:09:46.829 --> 00:09:53.123
we can have it in India, or have it
in America, anywhere.

00:09:53.324 --> 00:10:00.415
So I see all that before Me, and you’ll be
very well-known artists, all of you;

00:10:00.616 --> 00:10:10.734
even the Slovakia people have great talent
I must say. Such a great talent!

00:10:10.935 --> 00:10:17.621
This talent is a special gift of God, no
doubt. But to combine it, to express it,

00:10:17.822 --> 00:10:23.551
to work it out in such a collective manner,
is something very different

00:10:23.752 --> 00:10:30.343
and very beautiful, and it really made Me
feel very confident about you people,

00:10:30.544 --> 00:10:34.294
that one day through you Sahaja Yoga
will spread all over the world,

00:10:34.495 --> 00:10:41.617
and people will start knowing this Sahaj
orchestra and Sahaj artists.

00:10:41.818 --> 00:10:48.853
It’s really great, very great, and I bless
you from My heart for that.

00:10:51.031 --> 00:10:55.427
Then we had some other programs of this,
like Kathak dance,

00:10:55.628 --> 00:11:00.437
and also I’m amazed that a German girl
can dance so well that Kathak.

00:11:00.638 --> 00:11:05.620
It’s not easy, it’s very difficult. And
rhythmic sense, and all the expression

00:11:05.821 --> 00:11:10.400
and everything – she was so delicately
doing it, I was surprised.

00:11:10.601 --> 00:11:14.476
I never thought that German girls could
be that delicate, but really,

00:11:14.677 --> 00:11:18.717
they are so delicate and so beautifully
expressing

00:11:18.923 --> 00:11:27.925
the, all the delicacies of a lady
in her dancing, is…

00:11:28.126 --> 00:11:35.465
All – I don’t want to take your time
describing all of them,

00:11:35.666 --> 00:11:40.170
but one after another every program
has been great.

00:11:40.371 --> 00:11:48.521
And the way you are now depicting
those great musicians

00:11:48.721 --> 00:11:53.836
is something very creditable. Because world
has forgotten them.

00:11:54.044 --> 00:11:58.602
They want pop music, cheap music,
easy music –

00:11:58.803 --> 00:12:03.608
but once you start establishing it,
the vibrations will flow

00:12:03.809 --> 00:12:10.873
and people will realise how great this
music was and was lost.

00:12:11.074 --> 00:12:14.481
So this trend that is in the whole world

00:12:14.682 --> 00:12:22.077
is to become cheapish and to become
something very, very superficial,

00:12:22.278 --> 00:12:27.796
will be curbed by your own dedication
and your own expressions,

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:31.585
which will definitely make the vibrations
flow to the audience,

00:12:31.786 --> 00:12:37.113
and they will enjoy it very much.
Because you are now divine people,

00:12:37.314 --> 00:12:42.571
so your rendering is very different from
others, at least I felt that way.

00:12:42.772 --> 00:12:47.632
I felt – gave Me such great joy,
such great joy

00:12:47.833 --> 00:12:51.303
that I didn’t get from all other operas
I have seen,

00:12:51.504 --> 00:12:59.221
and somehow I couldn’t understand
the way they were

00:12:59.422 --> 00:13:04.238
quite confused I felt, not so well
organized as you people are.

00:13:04.439 --> 00:13:08.768
So, My blessings again and again
for all of you,

00:13:08.969 --> 00:13:16.391
and the way this program has been arranged
by these countries is I’m thankful to them,

00:13:16.592 --> 00:13:23.421
to their leaders, and to all of them that
they have done a very great job.

00:13:23.622 --> 00:13:27.145
So many people have come from other
countries also here,

00:13:27.346 --> 00:13:34.489
and they should also take a lesson,
and try to develop this style

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:41.179
of combining music and expressing
their great,

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:45.527
very great artists, that they have their
own compound (? Unclear word).

00:13:45.728 --> 00:13:56.344
I’m trying to get one of our Indian
if you say an opera-style thing here,

00:13:56.545 --> 00:14:02.106
but it’s very difficult to get so many
people. But you would enjoy that, really.

00:14:02.307 --> 00:14:07.968
So let us see if I could manage sometime
a group of people who will come

00:14:08.169 --> 00:14:11.854
and give you a kind of an opera
as you have.

00:14:12.087 --> 00:14:13.769
Thank you very much.
