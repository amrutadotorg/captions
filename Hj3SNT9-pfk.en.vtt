00:09.060 --> 00:22.620
The Chakra of the Goddess lies behind
the sternum bone in the spinal cord.

00:27.420 --> 00:37.320
This Chakra is placed above the Bhavasagara,
above the Void, as we call it in Sahaja Yoga.

00:38.520 --> 00:41.400
And the bridge that has to be crossed

00:45.900 --> 00:56.200
by the bhaktas, by the seekers, is guarded by Her.

00:58.320 --> 01:08.280
She’s the one She helps Her children
to come through that passage

01:12.300 --> 01:20.400
when there are negative forces
trying to attack on a seeker.

01:20.400 --> 01:24.900
This chakra is placed at the back
of the sternum bone as I told you.

01:26.700 --> 01:37.426
In childhood the antibodies
are formed in the sternum bone.

01:40.500 --> 01:47.546
They are the warriors or the
Sainikas (soldiers) of the Devi.

01:47.760 --> 01:56.801
Until the age of 12 years they
grow and multiply, and ultimately

01:58.500 --> 02:01.980
they all get distributed all over the body,

02:06.900 --> 02:14.640
and a human being is made able to
face any outside invasion on him.

02:23.280 --> 02:24.780
These antibodies

02:28.860 --> 02:30.120
know how to fight.

02:32.220 --> 02:39.780
They are extremely confident and
they know who are their enemies.

02:43.440 --> 02:48.489
They have all these messages built in themselves.

02:49.080 --> 02:57.170
So when the anti-God element enters
into the being through any process,

02:57.540 --> 03:10.001
say, through food, through words, through
action, through devilish people or black magic,

03:12.120 --> 03:23.686
these antibodies combine together,
collectively fight the invaders.

03:29.100 --> 03:37.150
Those who do not have their
Central Heart properly developed

03:37.620 --> 03:42.315
suffer from tremendous insecurity all their lives.

03:45.540 --> 03:55.140
When they are children, you try
to control them by frightening.

03:57.960 --> 04:02.760
These children later on become extremely insecure.

04:04.080 --> 04:08.763
They are afraid of darkness,
they are afraid of night.

04:09.480 --> 04:12.114
Some of them are afraid of everything.

04:14.100 --> 04:22.275
Because the antibodies that are built
in the body are not sufficient in number

04:24.240 --> 04:26.520
and being this center so weak,

04:31.020 --> 04:35.392
the person feels extremely insecure.

04:37.440 --> 04:42.960
Later on in life when the child goes
to the school or he tries to work

04:47.760 --> 04:51.327
out something for the future,

04:54.540 --> 05:01.708
then also his confidence can be shaken
by parents, teachers, and outside people.

05:04.200 --> 05:09.966
So it is very important to
understand children who are growing.

05:10.380 --> 05:13.620
I’ve told you the first reason,
the family insecurities.

05:14.580 --> 05:17.760
The child does not know when
he comes back from school,

05:17.760 --> 05:21.674
whether his mother would be
there or she would be gone.

05:24.900 --> 05:28.800
They don’t have mothers who can
bear a lot from the husbands

05:29.820 --> 05:35.745
and smile and show no signs of
their agony to their children.

05:36.180 --> 05:40.620
But the mothers in that country, I’ve
seen, always try to use their children

05:41.220 --> 05:45.725
from all kinds of emotional
blackmail, you can call it.

05:46.740 --> 05:51.240
They try to torture the child by telling
all the things the husband is doing to

05:51.240 --> 05:56.190
them and whatever is the problem
they are facing with the husbands.

05:57.300 --> 06:01.500
So the child is not secured by
the mother but on the contrary

06:01.500 --> 06:05.229
child starts giving security to mothers there.

06:06.480 --> 06:12.660
At a very young age it starts and the child
becomes extremely negative and left-sided.

06:12.660 --> 06:18.734
He feels that he’s born in a place
full of hatred, insecurity and fear.

06:21.360 --> 06:28.196
When the bhaktas are born in those
countries they are also the same way

06:29.280 --> 06:33.000
because they think if they
have to go to a guru, the guru,

06:34.080 --> 06:41.460
as known so far, tortures them or extracts
all the money, takes their pareekshan, test,

06:42.000 --> 06:47.200
and he sometimes leaves them
high and dry on the streets.

06:49.560 --> 06:56.100
But in our country the Goddess has
taken Incarnation many a times.

06:57.000 --> 07:04.560
Thousands time She has taken here Her
birth, whenever the bhaktas called Her,

07:05.100 --> 07:11.837
when they are pestered by the negative
forces, She came on this Earth to save them.

07:14.160 --> 07:28.500
These things used to be just accepted by people
but never were really accepted in their hearts.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.240
People thought these are some
sorts of mythological stories

07:33.240 --> 07:38.333
that the Goddess came on this Earth
and She tried to save the people.

07:39.720 --> 07:45.900
They could not believe that there could be
a Shakti who could be born, who could fight

07:45.900 --> 07:54.360
these horrible rakshasas and kill them, and
save Her children, Her bhaktas, from agony.

07:54.360 --> 07:55.999
It was too much.

07:57.300 --> 08:06.720
But today in Sahaja Yoga, you have seen that when
Kundalini rises and stops at the Center Nabhi (Heart),

08:07.800 --> 08:14.727
you have to say the mantra of
'Jagadamba' and the Kundalini rises.

08:15.960 --> 08:31.866
That means, She resides in the Center Heart and
when She is being worshipped the Kundalini rises.

08:33.060 --> 08:51.302
This center has got twelve petals but the
Goddess has thousand hands and thousand eyes.

08:53.400 --> 09:06.941
She has 16,000 Nadis to work out Her
different aspects of enlightenment.

09:08.280 --> 09:15.300
But the first thing She has to do, through
Her generosity and kindness and compassion

09:15.840 --> 09:26.880
and patience, She has to suck in the sins,
the Papavimochini, the sins of human beings.

09:28.380 --> 09:36.816
One of the sentences in Bible
was, “Wages of fear is sin."

09:38.220 --> 09:43.260
Or you can put it the other way
round, “The wages of sin is fear."

09:49.620 --> 09:58.301
If you have fear you are committing a
sin against your Self and against God.

09:59.100 --> 10:07.001
Because, if Mother is Almighty and
She can solve all your problems,

10:07.320 --> 10:12.360
you are under Her protection,
then why should you have any fear?

10:12.360 --> 10:15.709
That means you do not believe
that She’s that powerful.

10:20.280 --> 10:25.920
When a person is frightened this center starts

10:26.820 --> 10:33.600
breathing fast giving rhythmic
instructions to all the antibodies.

10:35.820 --> 10:42.404
With that you feel you are getting
a palpitation in the heart.

10:44.940 --> 10:52.798
This palpitation is nothing but a
signal to all the antibodies to fight

10:53.820 --> 10:56.373
the emergency of an attack.

10:57.480 --> 11:04.200
So the right side of every human
being represents the fatherhood,

11:05.880 --> 11:11.111
the fatherhood and the fatherhood
of a man is very important.

11:11.280 --> 11:20.100
If this center is spoilt or if there’s something
wrong with it, then you get asthma as a disease.

11:20.100 --> 11:28.939
Asthma is only caused by this center being spoilt
or some other combinations with this center.

11:28.939 --> 11:31.980
Asthma is very common among girls and boys.

11:31.980 --> 11:37.620
And, the relationship with the father
or the understanding of the father or

11:37.620 --> 11:43.080
your own fatherhood is not all right
you get this trouble of asthma and for

11:43.080 --> 11:49.364
that one has to ask the questions to the
sadhakas, what sort of a father you have?

11:49.698 --> 11:51.600
As one gentleman came and asked Me,

11:51.600 --> 11:54.840
“Why everybody’s asking me
what sort of a father you have?

11:54.840 --> 11:59.160
What sort of a, everybody asked me, what
about your father, what about your father?

11:59.160 --> 12:03.300
What has my father to do with me?”
Actually everybody feels the Right

12:03.300 --> 12:08.940
Heart and they have to ask about the father
because father resides in the Right Heart.

12:09.480 --> 12:12.420
And the principle of fatherhood, if it is spoilt,

12:12.420 --> 12:17.700
if there is a problem with the principle
of fatherhood, then you get this problem

12:17.700 --> 12:22.560
and many other problems, which I
do not want to discuss now at length.

12:22.560 --> 12:28.020
But you can understand a person who has no
father, how diffident he is and how he behaves,

12:28.020 --> 12:33.060
and also such people, those who have not
known a father can become very wayward,

12:33.060 --> 12:40.320
licentious or permissive, or could
be very much secretly licentious.

12:40.920 --> 12:45.960
The people who lose their father do
not have that,

12:45.960 --> 12:49.620
they lack in that discipline
that the father gives them.

12:49.620 --> 12:55.860
Or could be, such, people could
take to a very remorse and unhappy life.

12:55.860 --> 13:02.100
Or they could be very hard on their children or
could be extremely kind and spoil the children.

13:02.100 --> 13:02.880
It could be any way.

13:02.880 --> 13:11.580
So it has of both the reactions, either,
too much of love-giving or too much of strictness.

13:11.580 --> 13:12.600
It can be anything.

13:12.600 --> 13:16.560
Or a person could be, of this kind,

13:16.560 --> 13:20.880
may be very strict in childhood and
could be extremely lavish in old age.

13:20.880 --> 13:24.000
It’s a, it is a very imbalanced personality.

13:24.000 --> 13:29.757
So the person who has no father has
to know that his father is Shri Rama.

13:29.757 --> 13:30.960
He should not worry about anything.

13:30.960 --> 13:36.660
He is the One, with one, arrow
He can kill any number of people.

13:36.660 --> 13:41.040
So he should have no fear, at all about his

13:42.540 --> 13:47.430
father not being there or father being
dead or something happening like that.

13:47.430 --> 13:51.600
On the contrary if the father is dead it’s
better to tell him not to worry about

13:52.800 --> 13:57.480
you and that you are all
right so that you leave your

13:57.480 --> 14:01.740
father in peace and ask him to take his
birth than to bind him to this earth.

14:02.580 --> 14:08.820
This is the Right Heart and the Left Heart is the
mother, actually your own mother, whosoever it is.

14:08.820 --> 14:13.920
That is the motherhood in the sense
that if your mother has been extremely

14:14.520 --> 14:20.700
unkind and extremely funny or your
relationship with mother is bad,

14:20.700 --> 14:28.240
then know that there’s something wrong on the
Left Heart, which is indicated in you.
