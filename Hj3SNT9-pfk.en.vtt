00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:22.620
The Chakra of the Goddess lies behind&nbsp;
the sternum bone in the spinal cord.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:37.320
This Chakra is placed above the Bhavasagara,&nbsp;
above the Void, as we call it in Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.400
And the bridge that has to be crossed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:56.200
by the bhaktas, by the seekers, is guarded by Her.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:08.280
She’s the one She helps Her children&nbsp;
to come through that passage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:20.400
when there are negative forces&nbsp;
trying to attack on a seeker.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.900
This chakra is placed at the back&nbsp;
of the sternum bone as I told you.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:37.426
In childhood the antibodies&nbsp;
are formed in the sternum bone.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.546
They are the warriors or the&nbsp;
Sainikas (soldiers) of the Devi.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:56.801
Until the age of 12 years they&nbsp;
grow and multiply, and ultimately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.980
they all get distributed all over the body,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:14.640
and a human being is made able to&nbsp;
face any outside invasion on him.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.780
These antibodies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.120
know how to fight.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:39.780
They are extremely confident and&nbsp;
they know who are their enemies.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.489
They have all these messages built in themselves.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:57.170
So when the anti-God element enters&nbsp;
into the being through any process,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:10.001
say, through food, through words, through&nbsp;
action, through devilish people or black magic,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:23.686
these antibodies combine together,&nbsp;
collectively fight the invaders.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:37.150
Those who do not have their&nbsp;
Central Heart properly developed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.315
suffer from tremendous insecurity all their lives.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:55.140
When they are children, you try&nbsp;
to control them by frightening.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.760
These children later on become extremely insecure.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.763
They are afraid of darkness,&nbsp;
they are afraid of night.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.114
Some of them are afraid of everything.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:22.275
Because the antibodies that are built&nbsp;
in the body are not sufficient in number&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.520
and being this center so weak,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.392
the person feels extremely insecure.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.960
Later on in life when the child goes&nbsp;
to the school or he tries to work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.327
out something for the future,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:01.708
then also his confidence can be shaken&nbsp;
by parents, teachers, and outside people.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.966
So it is very important to&nbsp;
understand children who are growing.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.620
I’ve told you the first reason,&nbsp;
the family insecurities.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.760
The child does not know when&nbsp;
he comes back from school,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.674
whether his mother would be&nbsp;
there or she would be gone.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.800
They don’t have mothers who can&nbsp;
bear a lot from the husbands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.745
and smile and show no signs of&nbsp;
their agony to their children.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.620
But the mothers in that country, I’ve&nbsp;
seen, always try to use their children&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.725
from all kinds of emotional&nbsp;
blackmail, you can call it.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.240
They try to torture the child by telling&nbsp;
all the things the husband is doing to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.190
them and whatever is the problem&nbsp;
they are facing with the husbands.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.500
So the child is not secured by&nbsp;
the mother but on the contrary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.229
child starts giving security to mothers there.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:12.660
At a very young age it starts and the child&nbsp;
becomes extremely negative and left-sided.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:18.734
He feels that he’s born in a place&nbsp;
full of hatred, insecurity and fear.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:28.196
When the bhaktas are born in those&nbsp;
countries they are also the same way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.000
because they think if they&nbsp;
have to go to a guru, the guru,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:41.460
as known so far, tortures them or extracts&nbsp;
all the money, takes their pareekshan, test,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.200
and he sometimes leaves them&nbsp;
high and dry on the streets.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:56.100
But in our country the Goddess has&nbsp;
taken Incarnation many a times.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.560
Thousands time She has taken here Her&nbsp;
birth, whenever the bhaktas called Her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:11.837
when they are pestered by the negative&nbsp;
forces, She came on this Earth to save them.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:28.500
These things used to be just accepted by people&nbsp;
but never were really accepted in their hearts.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.240
People thought these are some&nbsp;
sorts of mythological stories&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:38.333
that the Goddess came on this Earth&nbsp;
and She tried to save the people.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:45.900
They could not believe that there could be&nbsp;
a Shakti who could be born, who could fight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:54.360
these horrible rakshasas and kill them, and&nbsp;
save Her children, Her bhaktas, from agony.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.999
It was too much.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:06.720
But today in Sahaja Yoga, you have seen that when&nbsp;
Kundalini rises and stops at the Center Nabhi (Heart),&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:14.727
you have to say the mantra of&nbsp;
'Jagadamba' and the Kundalini rises.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:31.866
That means, She resides in the Center Heart and&nbsp;
when She is being worshipped the Kundalini rises.

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:51.302
This center has got twelve petals but the&nbsp;
Goddess has thousand hands and thousand eyes.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:09:06.941
She has 16,000 Nadis to work out Her&nbsp;
different aspects of enlightenment.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:15.300
But the first thing She has to do, through&nbsp;
Her generosity and kindness and compassion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:26.880
and patience, She has to suck in the sins,&nbsp;
the Papavimochini, the sins of human beings.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:36.816
One of the sentences in Bible&nbsp;
was, “Wages of fear is sin."

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:43.260
Or you can put it the other way&nbsp;
round, “The wages of sin is fear."

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:58.301
If you have fear you are committing a&nbsp;
sin against your Self and against God.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:07.001
Because, if Mother is Almighty and&nbsp;
She can solve all your problems,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:12.360
you are under Her protection,&nbsp;
then why should you have any fear?

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.709
That means you do not believe&nbsp;
that She’s that powerful.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:25.920
When a person is frightened this center starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:33.600
breathing fast giving rhythmic&nbsp;
instructions to all the antibodies.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:42.404
With that you feel you are getting&nbsp;
a palpitation in the heart.

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:52.798
This palpitation is nothing but a&nbsp;
signal to all the antibodies to fight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.373
the emergency of an attack.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:04.200
So the right side of every human&nbsp;
being represents the fatherhood,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:11.111
the fatherhood and the fatherhood&nbsp;
of a man is very important.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:20.100
If this center is spoilt or if there’s something&nbsp;
wrong with it, then you get asthma as a disease.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:28.939
Asthma is only caused by this center being spoilt&nbsp;
or some other combinations with this center.

00:11:28.939 --> 00:11:31.980
Asthma is very common among girls and boys.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:37.620
And, the relationship with the father&nbsp;
or the understanding of the father or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:43.080
your own fatherhood is not all right&nbsp;
you get this trouble of asthma and for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:49.364
that one has to ask the questions to the&nbsp;
sadhakas, what sort of a father you have?

00:11:49.698 --> 00:11:51.600
As one gentleman came and asked Me,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.840
“Why everybody’s asking me&nbsp;
what sort of a father you have?

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:59.160
What sort of a, everybody asked me, what&nbsp;
about your father, what about your father?

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.300
What has my father to do with me?”&nbsp;
Actually everybody feels the Right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:08.940
Heart and they have to ask about the father&nbsp;
because father resides in the Right Heart.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.420
And the principle of fatherhood, if it is spoilt,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:17.700
if there is a problem with the principle&nbsp;
of fatherhood, then you get this problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:22.560
and many other problems, which I&nbsp;
do not want to discuss now at length.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:28.020
But you can understand a person who has no&nbsp;
father, how diffident he is and how he behaves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:33.060
and also such people, those who have not&nbsp;
known a father can become very wayward,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:40.320
licentious or permissive, or could&nbsp;
be very much secretly licentious.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:45.960
The people who lose their father do&nbsp;
not have that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.620
they lack in that discipline&nbsp;
that the father gives them.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:55.860
Or could be, such, people could&nbsp;
take to a very remorse and unhappy life.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:13:02.100
Or they could be very hard on their children or&nbsp;
could be extremely kind and spoil the children.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:02.880
It could be any way.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:11.580
So it has of both the reactions, either,&nbsp;
too much of love-giving or too much of strictness.

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:12.600
It can be anything.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:16.560
Or a person could be, of this kind,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:20.880
may be very strict in childhood and&nbsp;
could be extremely lavish in old age.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.000
It’s a, it is a very imbalanced personality.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.757
So the person who has no father has&nbsp;
to know that his father is Shri Rama.

00:13:29.757 --> 00:13:30.960
He should not worry about anything.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:36.660
He is the One, with one, arrow&nbsp;
He can kill any number of people.

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:41.040
So he should have no fear, at all about his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:47.430
father not being there or father being&nbsp;
dead or something happening like that.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:51.600
On the contrary if the father is dead it’s&nbsp;
better to tell him not to worry about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:57.480
you and that you are all&nbsp;
right so that you leave your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:01.740
father in peace and ask him to take his&nbsp;
birth than to bind him to this earth.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:08.820
This is the Right Heart and the Left Heart is the&nbsp;
mother, actually your own mother, whosoever it is.

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:13.920
That is the motherhood in the sense&nbsp;
that if your mother has been extremely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:20.700
unkind and extremely funny or your&nbsp;
relationship with mother is bad,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:28.240
then know that there’s something wrong on the&nbsp;
Left Heart, which is indicated in you.
