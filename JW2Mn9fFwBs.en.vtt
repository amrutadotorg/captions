00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.720
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:28.120
As doctor Reeves has told you,

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.440
you have to

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.880
become something.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.560
What do we have to become?

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.480
We are born as human beings,

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.480
and we take it for granted that we are human beings.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.720
[Shri Mataji smiles] We have to ask a question to ourselves :

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.720
why are we human beings?

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.520
What is the purpose of our life.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:09.920
Is it that the whole evolution is purposeless,

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:15.080
that there is no Divine play in it?

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.440
And why it was done with such care,

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.000
and why we have become human beings?

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:33.320
So first, we have to come to right conclusions –

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.280
that is the counseling you can call it –

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.880
we have come, we have to understand,

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.840
that we have not become what we are supposed to be.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.720
That’s why we are in confusion.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.000
We do not have answers for these

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.760
fundamental questions.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.080
Some believe in God, some don’t believe in God.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.720
Some believe in Christ, some believe in Mohammed.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.760
Some believe in Krishna,

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:07.400
some say that it’s all science.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.320
We are so confused,

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.720
and there is no answer to it.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:20.320
The reason is we are not that what we have to be.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.760
Supposing an instrument is given to you,

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.480
and you don’t know anything about that.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:32.200
Then you don’t know what is the purpose of that instrument,

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.880
and for which it was created,

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:39.120
and to what use it has to be put.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.480
Thus, there’s a confusion,

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.040
and the confusion is to such an extent,

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:52.880
that in that confusion we have formed firm ideas,

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.920
mental projections,

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.880
artificial,

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:03.280
without any biological basis for it.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.440
There is no biological basis for our

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:07.560
mental projections.

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.240
Just sit down here, and think now,

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.880
that see, this kind of a government if you make,

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.240
then people will be all right.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.080
This is your own mental projection.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.520
It has nothing living behind it;

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.920
it’s all dead thought.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.280
By changing the governments,

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.680
have you been able to transform the people?

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.760
I have been to Russia, I have been to China,

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.360
I have been to America, to all these places.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.600
Human beings are just the same

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.600
there is no difference whatsoever.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.800
Maybe some are more honest, some are more dishonest,

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.800
some are more immoral, some are less immoral,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.200
but, on the balance, if you see you find any kind of person everywhere.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.760
So one has to understand

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.960
that this kind of mental projection that we were having

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.960
about other things like social work,

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.080
people think that being social work and all that,

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.240
our ego can be conquered.

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:15.560
The greatest egoistical people are the social workers.

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:22.040
Now these mental projections have created also lots of norms for us.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:27.320
Like, I sit down here and decide I’ll give a title to someone.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.840
Now he becomes a titleholder.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.440
Then he’s off, finished,

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:35.640
once for all he’s dead now to anything that is reality

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.560
because he’s living with something so unreal,

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.480
which was given to him by somebody which is so unreal.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.320
There’s nothing living force behind it.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:49.800
Have you seen any man changing by getting some sort of a

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.120
title or lot of money?

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.480
On the contrary he becomes worse,

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.920
never improves.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.960
So what is the reason?

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:05.800
Why is it that when we go into an enterprise of this kind,

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:10.520
why is it, we find, that everything fails?

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.920
You talk of democracy, it becomes demonocracy.

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:17.360
You talk of communism, you find it is another headache.

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:21.360
You talk of anything, it all becomes such a funny thing,

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.920
and it recoils back on you.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:28.280
Whatever you try, any enterprise, it recoils back.

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:34.120
Science, what is science now has become nothing but atomic war.

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.200
How is it, science coming [running?] to atomic war, no one knows,

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.320
but suddenly it has become a great threat to the whole world.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:48.320
Computers, tomorrow computers will start dominating us.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.560
We see those things clearly happening to us,

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.880
and we are worried, we are shocked.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:58.200
But we don’t know why is it, whatever we try to do, why,

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.360
it recoils on us, and entangles us,

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.040
and enslaves us.

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.920
The reason is it’s, it has no living force behind it.

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:10.440
It’s only mental, at mental level,

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.920
and human beings live only on mental level.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:17.960
So there has to be another higher level

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:25.760
which is generated when you get in contact with a living force.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:30.240
Now let us see what is the living force.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:35.280
The living force is that which sprouts the seed.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.960
The Mother earth sprouts the seed.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:42.520
If you see the Mother Earth as it is, you don’t find anything in it, nothing.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.360
There’s just clay.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:47.360
But you put some seed

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:54.840
and that wasteful thing that you think of no use, this mud,

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:59.480
that gives that life to the seed,

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.960
and you find that the flowers become fruits,

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.400
automatically.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:10.400
It’s a wondrous world,

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.080
if you start looking at the living work of the living force,

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.840
because we are not in connection with that, whatever we do,

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.040
we go into problems,

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.280
but the nature does not,

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.880
while we do. The reason is we have lost

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:31.560
our biological sustenance or process.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:36.080
We are not biologically acting: it’s all dead action.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.600
What we do is all dead. For example, as I told you before also

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.920
that something is dead, a tree is dead and you make a chair, then you think, ‘I have made this thing’.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.000
From dead to dead to dead to dead,

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.320
and this dead sits on our head.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.320
You make a chair, you cannot sit on the ground.

00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:01.720
Then we start another thing like anti-culture business. That also just the same.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.320
Like pendulum we may move.

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.760
Now, we don’t like democracy, to have communism.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.720
From communism to democracy, democracy to communism,

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.480
there’s no movement!

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:15.480
Now what is the biological movement? Within us,

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.560
as you know, there are peptides [amino acids linked together] in our body,

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.920
and the biological movement of peptides is shown

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:26.600
when the movement is spiral.

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.040
When it is spiral then it’s biological,

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:36.480
and when it is linear then it is said that they have lost their biological sustenance.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.000
They have no biological quality in them.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.040
They have become linear.

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:48.040
So that sustenance within us, that spiral movement within us

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.960
is existing in our nerves,

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:57.680
but can become absolutely linear, leading to dead.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:02.480
All of our mental projections are linear,

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.760
because we cannot, with that, in our own awareness,

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.840
in our own awareness, jump higher.

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.600
It is so outside.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.280
For a man might say, think:

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.240
“Ah, I must try to improve the whole world, I must do this thing”.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.680
There was a gentleman I met who is in charge of the peace of the world,

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:24.040
and the most disturbed personality I have ever come across, you see.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.640
He was jumping this way, he was jumping this way,

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:29.880
every sort of disturbance was in his mind,

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.560
and he’s supposed to be in charge of the peace of the world; imagine.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.400
Now what’s the matter with the gentleman?

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.880
Though he thinks of peace, he thinks of such big things,

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.560
he talks of higher ideals, everything.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:46.400
What is it inside? There is nothing, no peace.

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.120
He’s just talking outside.

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.920
What is the reason?

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.240
The reason is it’s only linear.

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.480
He has accepted that he is in charge of the peace,

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.400
he must talk of big things, he must talk of ideal things,

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.240
and then the whole thing drops out.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.440
We had League of Nations, now we have United Nations:

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.640
all flops.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:13.080
So to make it spirally activated, what have we to do?

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:17.160
First of all we have to come to the right conclusion, understanding,

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:22.120
that whatever we have done so far has been linear in its action.

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:26.920
It’s not biological. We cannot transform a flower into a fruit.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.240
No living action we can take.

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.520
We cannot perform any living action.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.560
Once we understand that, then we have to know

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.480
that we have to become more

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:44.600
to be in connection with that living force,

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.920
that all-pervading force.

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:51.120
And to get to that all-pervading force, what have we to do?

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:55.040
Actually what did we do to become human beings?

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:58.920
Nothing. We just became, spontaneously, Sahaja.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.880
Sahaj: spontaneously.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:07.360
It was just some force within us which worked it out,

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:12.040
that made us human beings. We didn’t do anything.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.920
So one has to understand that if it is a living process,

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.480
then you don’t have to do anything about it.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:25.400
It is effortless. This is very difficult for human beings to understand.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:31.120
It is very difficult, because they live with their ego,

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:36.480
and they cannot accept that you cannot do it yourself.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.920
They think, “We can do it ourselves”,

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.480
which is not possible.

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.080
It cannot be done.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:50.880
You have to go to the Mother Earth to ask the seed to be sprouted.

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:55.320
You cannot sprout it. You may try to dissect it,

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.160
analyze it, put it under microscope,

00:28:58.360 --> 00:28:59.960
but you cannot sprout it.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:05.600
For sprouting, you have to surrender yourself to that Mother Earth who does the job.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.080
To begin with, we have to understand

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:15.240
that we are not capable of doing any living work whatsoever.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.040
Once we have that humility within us,

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:23.440
then we start seeing what can happen to us

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:30.320
by which we can become the masters of that living force.

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:41.040
To become something you have not done anything,

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.840
and to become higher you don’t have to do anything.

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:50.640
That means there is, built in within you, the complete mechanism

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.760
which is going to work it out.

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:57.080
Now before you, I would say, it’s like a hypothesis for you,

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:02.000
and you have to understand it as a scientist would understand, with an open mind,

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.680
because this is the science of the Divine.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.480
It’s not known so far.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.240
This is the knowledge of the roots,

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:11.320
not known to anyone so far, I can say.

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:14.760
But to [be] known to some people who have evolved themselves,

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:22.160
they have gone above that state that is just mental,

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:26.240
and these are the very few people who know what it is.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:31.360
This knowledge is not of today; is of thousands of years,

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:35.920
but, is not the knowledge of the tree, as I told you, which we have,

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:40.160
but is the knowledge of the roots, which we have to understand.

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:45.560
The knowledge of the roots is that, within you is placed the root,

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.400
is called (Shri Mataji speaks aside to the yogis present: “Is it here? No, ah.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.400
Somebody can come up, please.”)

00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:00.640
Here, in the triangular bone is placed the thing called Kundalini.

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:05.080
It is a Sanskrit word. One should not be so frightened of Sanskrit.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:09.080
I was surprised, when I went to America, the first question they asked me:

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:13.480
“Why should you come and teach us about these things

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.240
which were in your country?”

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.440
I said: “To Me, it is just the same

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.920
whether it is America or India.

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:27.480
Why did you come to India to teach us about science?”

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.720
Why this kind of an attitude people have?

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:39.000
Wherever there is knowledge, a humble person must go and seek it.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.680
This was discovered about 14 000 years back,

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:46.360
where, in England, I don’t think people lived here, in this country.

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.560
So why should anybody feel humiliated?

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.360
When you think you are English, or you are American,

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.920
you are wrong. You are a human being.

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.160
God never made a world like that.

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:02.880
We are all one, and everybody has to support each other.

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.960
Like a flower thinks, “I am a flower”,

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.800
a leaf thinks, “I am a leaf”,

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.600
and the roots think they are roots,

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.800
then how the whole tree is going to manifest, just think?

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
We are one,

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:18.080
there’s nothing that you are the tree,

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.200
and you are the leaf,

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.360
and you are the flower, and we are everything.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:27.160
So to think like that if that, is another mental projection we have,

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.760
that “I am this” and “I am that”.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.720
You are just a human being,

00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:36.640
which has been created by God’s grace,

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:41.200
to this level, as the most beautiful thing,

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.920
the epitome, of His creation.

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:48.480
I would say that, in the west, there are more seekers, perhaps,

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.960
than we have in the east, perhaps,

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.480
but that doesn’t mean that it is only because it is England,

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.800
or America,

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:02.480
but it is only that all over the world, God has this blessing

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.480
and the message for everyone.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:11.680
So first of all we must understand that this is the knowledge of the roots,

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:15.600
and this knowledge of the roots, unless and until we know about it,

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:20.720
we have no right to criticize it.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.840
Moreover, by criticizing you are not the gainer,

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.480
you are the loser.

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:29.360
So with complete openness of a student

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:34.320
we have to see to this, that this great force is placed within us,

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.040
in a triangular bone,

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:39.240
whether you are an Australian, American, English, Indian,

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:41.720
or coming from Timbuctoo.

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.560
All of you, if you are human beings,

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.960
God has placed this force within.

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:49.960
He doesn’t understand these differences, actually.

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.320
It’s only we do understand.

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:55.440
For Him it’s the one world, that beautiful world He has created,

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:58.720
and all the human beings are His children.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:03.920
So in this triangular bone, is placed this beautiful thing

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.840
called the Kundalini,

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:10.120
and this Kundalini is the motherhood within you.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.760
It’s a quality.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:17.480
It has nothing to do with a woman or a man. It’s a quality,

00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:20.360
is a type, a personality.

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:24.160
For example, I would say today, Mahatma Gandhi, people accept him

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.080
as a great man,

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:29.440
because he had the quality of compassion.

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:33.760
He had the quality of giving, of nourishing.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:38.520
In the same way all the saints of the world had this quality.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:43.880
They were motherly, full of compassion, love.

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.960
Christ had the same.

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:52.520
He was so full of compassion that you cannot call him, in the worldly way, a man,

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:55.880
because man means he must hate, he must aggress,

00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:00.800
he must do all kinds of things to show his ego.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:07.440
No. He was a personality who had compassion, who had nourishment.

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:15.400
Now to become that personality, what have we to do?

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:18.720
Again, say I, nothing, because it is all placed within you.

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:24.000
The expression of Kundalini within you is the expression of that great personality.

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:28.480
When that happens to you, you yourself become like the Mother Earth,

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.720
that you can give,

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.160
you can project yourself,

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:40.320
that you become compassion yourself and your compassion acts.

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:42.960
These days,

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:49.200
Kali Yuga is the modern times, what was the Kali Yuga, the days of confusion, is over,

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:52.800
and is called as Krita Yuga,

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.720
means where this living force will act,

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.800
and this living force has to act through you.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.080
You become the medium of that living force.

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.840
Actually you become the master of that.

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:10.440
But the beauty of this is that it manifests within you also.

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:15.320
For example, the electricity is flowing through this; it doesn’t do anything to this instrument.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:19.680
But when this force starts flowing through you, you get completely transformed

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.960
into a new personality,

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:27.320
and a personality that Christ had described that you are to be born again.

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:32.080
Again, linear way, is that artificially people can brand themselves

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.840
‘born again’.

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:39.800
But when it happens to [you] are completely transformed from within,

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.120
and the transformation is so visible,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
and so active, as Krita Yuga has started,

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:50.720
that you are amazed. You cannot believe, it is fantastic,

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.920
because you are fantastically made,

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.080
extremely fantastically made,

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.920
and that all things starts expressing itself

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:01.720
as soon as it manifests.

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:06.560
So a human being should know that he’s made with great care,

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:08.680
great love,

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:11.200
and for a very great thing:

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.560
is to enjoy the love of his Father.

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:20.920
When this Kundalini rises within you, passes through six chakras –

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:24.680
the seventh it does not cross; the seventh is the guard [Mooladhara chakra] -

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:31.160
then it creates that spiral movement within our awareness.

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:37.120
The awareness itself gets spirally formed,

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:40.080
and instead of moving in a pendulum

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:43.120
you move in such a way that you jump higher.

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:46.480
Your awareness becomes higher than what it used to be.

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:49.720
So the human awareness becomes higher.

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:54.920
There are lots of misunderstandings about this,

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:59.400
and it comes from the ignorance,

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:03.600
because when you start seeking something from ignorance,

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:09.080
what happens that whatever you find, is a partial truth

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:11.320
or could be something not the truth.

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:14.440
For example, in the darkness, you might see this

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.720
and think it’s a snake.

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.880
A wire might look like a snake to you.

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:24.280
But supposing you suddenly become enlightened.

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:28.360
Of course, in the beginning, light may not be that strong.

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:31.160
In some people it could be little bit,

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:33.200
just a flicker.

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.480
But you start seeing then,

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.960
and gradually, if the light improves,

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:40.760
and the lantern improves, I can say

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:45.360
then you start seeing it, very clearly, what has gone wrong with you,

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.080
and you start correcting it.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.760
Now the new awareness that comes into you

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.840
is not something that can be just certified that,

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:58.080
“All right, now you are realized souls, have a brand and go ahead.”

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.320
It is not that way.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:03.920
But you become conscious of that awareness,

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.680
because for the first time, when the Kundalini pierces

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.360
through this fontanelle bone area,

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:15.560
then you feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming in.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:20.400
In the Sanskrit language, Holy Ghost is called as Adi Shakti.

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:22.720
Most surprising is that,

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:26.360
I don’t know why, but in the Bible,

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:29.320
Holy Ghost was not discussed much.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.760
Adi Shakti is the Holy Ghost,

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:36.320
and about Adi Shakti if you have to learn, you have to go to Indian Scriptures.

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:45.080
Even in the Old Testament they say Jews know about it.

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.720
Now this power,

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.560
which is the All-Pervading power of God,

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.280
the power of His Love,

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:59.320
becomes evident, because you start feeling it on your fingers.

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:01.360
And as you say in the English language,

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.160
you know, on your fingertips.

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.840
Your hands start speaking.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.600
You can feel another personality,

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.000
you can put the hand towards another person,

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:13.480
and you can see

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.680
what are the centers catching, because

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:18.960
they are shown on this five, six and seven on the right,

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.920
five, six and seven on the left.

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.000
This is the emotional side,

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:28.520
and the right is the physical and the mental side.

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:33.560
Now the doctors cannot deal with the psychosomatic,

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.360
or psychological things,

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:39.520
and it’s a very big problem because there is only analysis going on.

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:42.800
Now, for a doctor it is important to know

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:46.200
both the sides of human beings, or I would say the three sides:

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.720
the physical, the mental and the emotional.

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:52.480
But it is not so – he just knows part of it,

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.200
while a psychologist knows a part of it,

00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:00.480
and that’s how we cannot find out the reason

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:03.200
for the problems that exist within us.

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:05.600
But when this Kundalini rises,

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.920
She passes through these six centers

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:11.200
which are the milestones of our evolution,

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:13.920
and thus integrates you completely.

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:18.480
So the first thing you receive is the integration.

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:21.360
By that integration you are amazed that

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.480
physically you get cured.

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.640
There has been a criticism about us

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.600
in the newspaper,

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.240
that we have started curing people.

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.720
Thank God we are not in America; there we would have been arrested,

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:38.520
because the doctors there do not allow anybody to cure anyone.

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:42.640
But we do not cure. Automatically it happens: when the Kundalini will rise,

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:48.520
automatically it will happen that your whole being itself

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:56.080
will become integrated by which you will be healed.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:59.400
You will heal yourself, nobody else is going to heal you.

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:03.960
I don’t know under law if you can charge a person if he heals himself,

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:10.000
but this will exactly happen that you will heal yourself,

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:12.520
and you will know how to heal yourself.

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:15.720
But this is nothing.

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:21.360
Is not only the physical side of it that happens to you.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:24.320
Is just the minimum of minimum.

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:29.000
But those people who (are?) suffering from mental trouble also get healed.

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:35.760
The third side of it is that physically you are all right,

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:39.720
mentally you are all right, and emotionally also, you are all right.

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:44.120
Now there’s a very big confusion about mental and emotional in English language.

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:47.600
So if you have to say ‘mental’ as the brain is concerned,

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:54.200
then they mean to say that person who is mad is a mental case.

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:56.880
Actually he’s a heart case,

00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:02.160
because he’s working with his heart. He weeps, cries,

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:06.480
but his head goes off, it’s a balance.

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.800
When he’s working with his head too much, his heart goes off.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.080
That’s another balance of the nature.

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:15.320
So if you have even the problem if you think too much,

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:18.280
some people are so mad that they go on thinking

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.200
like mad, they cannot stop their thinking,

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:23.680
they think, think, think, think,

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:27.600
and they’re thinking maddens them, but they cannot stop it.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:32.160
So here, when the Kundalini rises, onto this point,

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.360
you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:37.320
You don’t have to think; you can stop your thoughts.

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:40.640
If you want to think you can think, if you want to stop, you can stop.

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:44.520
It is not necessary for you to think,

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:46.560
and that’s exactly what happens

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:51.840
when the Kundalini rises here, that mentally you become absolutely comfortable.

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:58.400
Now this business

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:01.080
of raising the Kundalini

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.640
is a business of God,

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:07.160
and which cannot be sold.

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:11.920
You cannot have a business on the human level. You cannot sell it.

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.040
You just cannot do it.

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:18.680
How it happens is automatically.

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.960
By the grace of God it works out.

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:25.040
You cannot sell anything that is the grace of God.

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:26.680
What is the value of that?

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:29.520
On this point only many people discard Sahaja Yoga

00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:33.000
because they think that it cannot be sold so it must be useless.

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:37.280
It is so invaluable that you cannot pay for it.

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:44.320
Now the rising of the Kundalini has to take place, first of all.

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:49.200
But with these three advantages the fourth advantage is the highest:

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:52.080
That you become the Spirit.

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:56.440
The Spirit is the one who is the master in you.

00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:01.480
So you become your own master, you become your own guru.

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:04.280
Nobody has to tell you ‘do this’ or ‘do that’;

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:05.600
you are guided,

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:08.760
because as soon as the Kundalini rises,

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:12.720
you start feeling the cool breeze in your hands.

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:16.480
And these are giving you a new vibrations,

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:18.320
a new dimension

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:20.920
by which you know whether to do this or not.

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:24.440
For example, you want to do something; you want to buy a book.

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:27.640
You don’t have to decide about it:

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:31.880
as soon as you go near the book either it will give you cool breeze,

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:36.720
or it may make you hot, or it may little bit burn also if it’s a horrid one,

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:40.200
and you don’t want to have that at any cost, you want to have the cool breeze

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:41.440
because you enjoy it.

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:42.800
So you just give up.

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:47.440
You just give up things without anybody telling you,

00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:49.720
because your vibrations tell you.

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:52.960
The spirit that has now shine in your attention,

00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:56.360
tells you, and you start understanding,

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:59.040
that now I have become my own guru,

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:03.080
because your guru is sitting inside you as the Spirit.

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:08.880
It has not yet manifested in your attention and that’s why you’re worried.

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:11.440
But just it manifests,

00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:13.760
and once it manifests you are amazed,

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:16.800
that you yourself may have become a guru of yourself.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.880
You don’t need anybody else to tell you, but you can do it yourself.

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:25.320
You can find out yourself. Nobody has to give any explanation,

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:28.320
or correction, or anything,

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:34.320
you just start improving yourself. Automatically it works,

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:36.880
and little bit, if you know,

00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:40.680
how to decode it, and how to work it out, your problems,

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:43.400
you just manage it.

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.440
You become yourself a guru.

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:48.760
That’s the thing you have to be.

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.720
Of course I told you, you cannot pay for it.

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:54.960
It’s an insult even to think that you can pay for it.

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.080
Nobody can understand this;

00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:01.640
that this is complete benevolence, is complete.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.320
It’s not mercenary act of benevolence,

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:08.000
but it is a complete, absolute benevolence,

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:10.320
and for this benevolence you cannot pay.

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:13.040
As soon as you pay for it, it is no more of benevolence.

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:17.240
And that’s why you cannot pay for it.

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:21.400
You cannot work it out, it has to just work out.

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:27.440
Now, especially in the west, there is a problem with people that they think,

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:29.520
“Why should Mother do it?”

00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:32.120
I tell you, it’s a thankless job.

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:36.320
You cannot do it. If you can do it, I’ll be happy to retire.

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:39.000
But you cannot do it. That’s the point.

00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:41.320
This is my job, what am I to do?

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:43.960
Supposing I am that, what am I to do now?

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:45.920
If I have to do it,

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:49.920
if I am supposed to do it, then what should I do?

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:53.080
I mean supposing you are posted as something; you are a policeman,

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:55.720
you have to do the policeman’s job.

00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:59.240
Now, how can you challenge it?

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:01.280
He has to do it.

00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:05.640
As if you can say, I’m paid for it, or you can say that

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:07.200
this is my job.

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:13.320
This I have to do, though I know it is very, very troublesome.

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.560
To get it done is not easy,

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:17.240
it’s not very easy.

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:19.320
Everyone may not get realization,

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:21.120
I cannot guarantee that.

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:24.240
I cannot say that you all will get the realization,

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:26.120
it’s a very difficult thing.

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:29.720
Some people will just miss it for some time.

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:31.720
There’s nothing to be worried about it;

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:35.600
it has to be corrected. It has to be redeemed, as they say.

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:37.520
The Kundalini has to be brought up,

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:41.960
if there are centers catching they have to be cleared out, they have to be brought up,

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:45.800
and we have to have complete understanding

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.080
and compassion about ourselves,

00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:50.480
and love for ourself and respect for ourself.

00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:52.720
That if you have to become the light,

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:56.880
then we have to adjust and cooperate.

00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:59.400
Now the thing is that

00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:05.800
the ego part of it is the strongest enemy of realization.

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:08.440
I.

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:11.320
I like it. I am this, I am that.

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:14.760
When you say of ‘I, it is not yourself,

00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:18.200
your spirit, but it is your ego that’s saying ‘I’.

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:21.520
When you become the spirit you don’t say ‘I’,

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:23.640
but you say ‘it’.

00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:28.360
You talk in the third person.

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:32.400
You say, ‘It is not coming up, it is not working out, it is not’,

00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:33.720
in a third way.

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:36.080
You never say, ‘I will raise the Kundalini’.

00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:38.760
What you will say: ‘the Kundalini is not coming up.

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:43.320
The Kundalini is not there.’ In a third person you start talking,

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:47.040
so that you do not take any credit or discredit for it.

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:51.480
Now, it is for you to observe it

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:55.280
and see for yourself. It depends on your power of observation.

00:49:55.480 --> 00:50:00.560
Whatever doctors may tell you, or anything, you don’t have to believe those,

00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:03.720
because it depends on your own observation

00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:06.040
and sense of penetration.

00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:10.240
Like I would say, I went to the Union Society

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:13.640
and the Chairman of the Union Society was 82-year-old man.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.840
And he got his realization.

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:20.520
And I told about Jung’s mistake why he missed the point,

00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:22.720
which they understood very well.

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:25.400
But then he got up, very humbly, and he says,

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:27.920
“Mother, now you have learned our language,

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:31.480
let us talk your language, let us learn your language”.

00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:35.240
And then at the second meeting he says, ‘Now I have observed –

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:40.480
it’s not a question, but my observation, if it is true – that you don’t believe in time.

00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:43.800
There’s no time.’ Just you give it like that.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.040
That depends on your own observation.

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:49.560
But I would not like to accept any ideas about Me

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:52.080
because I know it is terrible;

00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:55.720
sometimes it can act against. I mean, some people may just leave, you know,

00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:58.280
they can’t bear it anymore.

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:03.040
So that’s not the point. You have to see for yourself, observe yourself.

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.760
There’s nothing to gain from you, at all for Me,

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:08.400
you cannot give Me anything, whatever you may try.

00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:10.400
There’s nothing to ask for.

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:13.920
It is you who have to take something from Me which you better have it.

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:17.320
I’m like a cashier on the bank, see?

00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:19.840
You have got your cheques.

00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:22.320
Now, I have nothing to get from you.

00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:27.560
The cashier is paid for, all right, that’s one point, is different, from the employer,

00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:29.280
but not by you.

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:34.400
And what I have to do is to take your cheques and cash it.

00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:39.200
Now, when you are in that position, will you be angry with me for that?

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:42.040
Will you say to your cashier, “Why are you doing this to me?

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:44.720
Why should I take money from you?”

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:48.120
If that is intelligible,

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:51.880
then we can see there is some meeting point between us,

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:57.520
and we can talk of realization then in a way that it has to be done.

00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:01.120
You all have to have your key,

00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:04.240
your spirit, that is within you.

00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:08.720
Perhaps I know that better than you.

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:11.200
You know many things better than Me.

00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:14.080
I don’t know even how to use a plastic bag,

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:16.760
but I know how to open the Kundalini.

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:21.360
I am so hopelessly bad at so many things which are so trivial and simple

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:24.440
which you can do just like that, I cannot do it.

00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:25.800
So it’s all right,

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.400
so, I am also quite humble about it, I don’t mind.

00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:34.560
I don’t know many things, but I know one thing, is that you are the Spirit,

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:36.440
and you have to become the Spirit,

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:38.960
through the awakening of your Kundalini.

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:41.160
This is what a Mother can do,

00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:46.080
is to explain to you, that come to the right conclusion, that you have to have it,

00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:48.920
it is within you, and you have to get it.

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.600
But I cannot force it on you.

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:54.080
I cannot make you take it.

00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:57.920
Or else if you do not want to have it I just can’t do it.

00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:00.440
It’s impossible. There’s no hypnosis in it.

00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:05.720
It’s a happening that has to take place with complete understanding of your freedom.

00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:10.280
I hope you will understand this new method,

00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:12.560
that if you have to go to the roots,

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:14.960
you have to become subtler than what you are,

00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:18.720
and to become that subtler being, you have to become the Spirit,

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:21.480
your Kundalini has to be awakened.
