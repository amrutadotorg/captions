Shri Devi Puja. Rahuri (Hindistan)
26 Ocak 1984

02:40.125 --> 02:46.083
Rahuri has a special significance in the history of the Goddess,

02:47.250 --> 02:55.166
that when the horrible rakshasa, called Rahu,

02:58.125 --> 03:02.333
started ruling this area and devastating it.

03:04.041 --> 03:09.125
The whole suffered, all the God-fearing people ….

03:10.709 --> 03:15.583
Then the Goddess took Her incarnation

03:17.208 --> 03:21.709
here and She killed this man, this rakshasa

03:23.333 --> 03:25.250
and there are different places

03:25.333 --> 03:28.709
where how he ran, how She caught him

03:29.083 --> 03:33.709
and ultimately killed – he was killed in Rahuri.

03:34.291 --> 03:40.250
And that’s why rahu-ri – “ri” starts from the Hrim,

03:41.166 --> 03:44.333
as you know that: Aim, Klim, Hrim

03:44.709 --> 03:49.333
are the three words denoting the three powers of the Goddess.

03:49.709 --> 03:54.041
Aim, Hrim and Klim: Aim is the Mahakali,

03:55.625 --> 04:01.709
Hrim is the Mahalakshmi and Klim is the Mahasaraswati.

04:02.709 --> 04:07.583
So, with the Hrim-power She killed this rakshasa,

04:07.709 --> 04:11.250
and then – after that killing –

04:12.125 --> 04:14.333
bhaktas started living here.

04:15.125 --> 04:17.500
And a king came all the way from Rajpur,

04:17.709 --> 04:23.709
Rajputana – and started worshipping the Goddess.

04:26.583 --> 04:32.041
And went – he was a poor man, he came here as a poor man –

04:33.583 --> 04:37.041
while worshipping the Goddess

04:39.583 --> 04:42.709
he raised this again into another kingdom,

04:43.542 --> 04:46.583
and that’s why they are called as Shalivahanas

04:46.709 --> 04:50.041
because they carry the shawl of the Goddess.

04:51.583 --> 04:57.375
This Shalivahanas, later on in the dynasty, was a [INDIST., SOUNDS LIKE Bhobruvaha]

04:57.709 --> 05:00.333
who fought with the [INDIST. SOUNDS LIKE Maharaja]

05:00.709 --> 05:04.041
and defeated him, who was from Ujiara [?]. Surprisingly

05:04.458 --> 05:07.125
many of My relations are still in Ujiara

05:07.458 --> 05:10.208
and they are following a new vision.

05:12.333 --> 05:15.333
So because he fought him

05:15.542 --> 05:21.041
and he captured him

05:21.333 --> 05:24.208
many people from here shifted there

05:24.375 --> 05:29.458
and settled down in Ujiara.

05:31.083 --> 05:36.667
Now this Rahuri developed gradually

05:39.041 --> 05:42.125
into a very modern city,

05:42.500 --> 05:45.709
or you can say in a modernized.

05:47.333 --> 05:52.500
And when we go to [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE Nankhara] you will be able to see it.

05:53.083 --> 05:55.709
The forefathers

05:56.333 --> 05:58.625
of Mine were called as Shalivahanas

05:59.041 --> 06:03.125
and My mother`s place [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE Rhaduvas] where they resided and lived.

06:03.333 --> 06:07.041
So Rahuri has a special significance

06:07.333 --> 06:11.041
in the life of Sahaja Yoga, or I should say in My own life.

06:12.083 --> 06:16.542
And that is why surprisingly that in Rahuri we have established

06:16.709 --> 06:21.291
our center in the biggest way.

06:21.709 --> 06:24.291
Because the kings here worshipped

06:24.709 --> 06:29.500
the Mother with a shawl.

06:30.166 --> 06:35.041
Now this has a special meaning as the significance

06:35.333 --> 06:38.041
goes, or you can say the symbolic - it is -

06:38.208 --> 06:41.208
it covers the modesty of the Mother.

06:42.208 --> 06:45.709
Mother protects us, She looks after us.

06:46.333 --> 06:49.041
So this is the one which covers Her,

06:49.333 --> 06:53.166
gives Her the grace,

06:53.709 --> 06:57.291
gives Her the protection from the cold

06:57.500 --> 07:00.709
and when the children are suffering,

07:01.125 --> 07:06.333
or are tired, or are sick She covers them with the shawl.

07:07.458 --> 07:10.625
So the shawl has a very big meaning

07:11.500 --> 07:14.458
and because the used to carry the shawl of the Mother

07:14.583 --> 07:16.709
all the time in their hands,

07:17.125 --> 07:20.000
that’s why they are called as Shalivahanas.

07:20.166 --> 07:22.542
So the significance of Rahuri is very great

07:22.709 --> 07:24.709
and you will also see that

07:25.166 --> 07:30.375
in the gross also the people here are very receptive to Sahaja Yoga.

07:30.709 --> 07:36.709
Even the factory people – I went to see them before I came here,

07:37.166 --> 07:40.083
to talk to them. And they are so much submerged

07:40.333 --> 07:42.291
in the developments of Sahaja Yoga

07:42.458 --> 07:44.458
and amount of things they want to do,

07:44.709 --> 07:47.709
and want to take advantage of Sahaja Yoga here.

07:48.041 --> 07:50.041
As they are built for you especially too

07:50.166 --> 07:53.583
was made with great care about from that they thought

07:54.041 --> 07:57.041
that it was finished and worked very hard.

07:57.250 --> 08:01.000
Day and night, just to prepare this hall for you.

08:02.333 --> 08:04.375
So this is how it is going to work out,

08:04.583 --> 08:07.041
and last time I told them that you should not make

08:07.291 --> 08:10.583
an alcohol out of these molasses

08:10.709 --> 08:13.125
[??] and sell it at the market at a cheap rate,

08:13.375 --> 08:15.500
but make something useful.

08:15.709 --> 08:17.166
So they are trying to find out

08:17.333 --> 08:19.458
a technique about which I talked to them now.

08:19.709 --> 08:22.709
So they are very religious people also.

08:23.208 --> 08:25.333
And they are trying to improve the lot of the people,

08:25.542 --> 08:30.709
by removing all these addictions among the people.

08:32.709 --> 08:35.709
So that is the significance of Rahuri-Puja

08:36.291 --> 08:39.083
and that’s what it is, that you are like Shalivahanas

08:39.333 --> 08:44.667
who are worshipping the Mother and Her shawl.

08:45.542 --> 08:48.709
So today’s Puja has a special significance

08:49.458 --> 08:53.709
– that’s why Rahuri we have very good Sahaja Yogis here,

08:54.333 --> 09:00.166
very developed, very evolved, moral people.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.625
They are not scholars of Sanskrit,

09:04.041 --> 09:07.166
but they are scholars of Sahaja Yoga.

09:07.625 --> 09:12.208
There is a difference between being a scholar of Sanskrit

09:12.458 --> 09:14.542
and a scholar of Sahaja Yoga.

09:16.291 --> 09:21.250
Now for you people I hope it has been a comfortable

09:21.625 --> 09:26.583
stay for you here and

09:28.291 --> 09:33.458
we hope also for the future you are going to enjoy

09:34.166 --> 09:39.041
your journey and enjoy the bliss of the Divine!

09:40.250 --> 09:47.583
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

10:13.667 --> 10:15.542
We don’t read about Rahul`s killing,

10:15.709 --> 10:18.333
because it is Mahalakshmi who killed,

10:18.667 --> 10:22.709
but what we read in the Devi-Mahatmya is the Mahakali`s powers.

10:23.125 --> 10:27.041
But Rahul was killed here in Rahuri by Mahalakshmi,

10:27.709 --> 10:32.333
and that Mahalakshmi power is called as Hrim power,

10:32.709 --> 10:34.500
so that’s why this is Rahu-ri.

10:34.667 --> 10:40.250
Actually it is Rahu-hrim we can say it is Rahu-ri to make it simple.

10:41.333 --> 10:44.709
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

11:26.041 --> 11:28.000
And according to that calendar only

11:28.166 --> 11:30.709
all the Maharashtrians are living,

11:31.208 --> 11:35.667
which is very, I should say, much more subtler than vikram,

11:36.166 --> 11:38.625
this thing. Because in the [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: vikram-panjaga]

11:39.083 --> 11:43.000
this area is still called as Kali-Yuga, Kali-Yuga,

11:43.250 --> 11:46.583
but in this [INDIST: SOUNDS LIKE: panjaga; Then: Shalivahana-Panjaga]

11:47.000 --> 11:49.417
it is called as Krita-Yuga. It’s much subtler.

11:49.583 --> 11:53.667
That’s a very wider thing

11:54.041 --> 11:58.041
and it doesn’t give you the different sections

11:58.375 --> 12:01.333
of Kali-Yuga, that how it becomes Krita-Yuga

12:01.500 --> 12:04.542
and ultimately a Satya-Yuga.

12:04.709 --> 12:11.709
The calendar that was used by the North Indians

12:12.250 --> 12:15.709
was the Vikram, and the South Indians used the Shalivahana,

12:16.125 --> 12:20.583
but especially in Maharashtra. But the support came mainly from

12:21.000 --> 12:25.333
[INDIST.] direct, who said that this is the better [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: panjaga]

12:25.625 --> 12:31.625
because it deals with subtler side of time.

12:32.291 --> 12:33.667
Subtler side of time.

12:34.125 --> 12:37.709
And that’s why it was regarded as a greater thing.

12:38.166 --> 12:43.458
Now on the first day of

12:43.709 --> 12:48.458
this calendar they put a kalasha

12:49.041 --> 12:55.041
[? A pot] with a shawl as a banner, a kalasha and a shawl as a banner.

12:55.500 --> 13:01.333
That’s why kalash, which is the Kundalini, is the Aquarius.

13:04.041 --> 14:26.083
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

14:27.041 --> 14:29.709
In the older days all the Maharashtrian women used to have

14:30.125 --> 14:35.709
some sort of an additional cloth, a shawl, which they used to carry.

14:36.500 --> 14:39.667
If it was a marriage then they used to have a marriage sari,

14:40.041 --> 14:41.709
[INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: completed with that shawl].

14:42.333 --> 14:46.291
All the time they had to wear something, a covering over the sari.

14:46.500 --> 14:49.458
Sari was not the end-cloth but now we have become modern,

14:49.667 --> 14:54.709
so we don’t use the, that, another cloth which one has to use.

14:55.333 --> 14:57.709
So, but this is only the custom.

14:58.125 --> 15:01.250
In India is not the point, it is not only in Maharashtra, everywhere.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.709
But there, because a dress was not a sari,

15:04.166 --> 15:07.125
but those who bore the sari did not use, in the North.

15:07.375 --> 15:11.375
But here those who use the sari also use the shawl, on top of that.

15:11.667 --> 15:14.625
And that’s why, you see, this country has a speciality,

15:14.709 --> 15:18.125
this part that they always had this shawl,

15:18.291 --> 15:21.333
whether they went out, for their protection,

15:21.458 --> 15:22.709
or they went for a marriage

15:23.125 --> 15:26.166
or anything they used to have another thing on top.

15:26.458 --> 15:29.458
Now of course we have, symbolically, something modernized.

15:29.583 --> 15:32.333
This is, wearing little pieces to be used as shawls.

15:32.500 --> 15:35.458
You see, everything is getting modernized.

15:36.500 --> 16:13.709
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

18:08.709 --> 18:13.709
You must, all right, touch the feet of this Rahuri-Land.

18:19.000 --> 18:26.083
Then after, Ganesha, we must also touch the feet.

18:27.709 --> 18:31.291
As soon as I get the land, first we establish Ganesha here,

18:31.625 --> 18:33.250
and once this land, we get

18:33.417 --> 18:35.625
everywhere in the whole world, we get land

18:36.041 --> 18:39.667
and we have no problems of any kind as far as the land is concerned.

18:40.083 --> 18:43.667
When the Ashram is built here, everywhere in the whole world

18:44.041 --> 18:47.709
we’ll have Ashrams. So the beginning has to be at the right place.

19:02.333 --> 19:16.709
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

19:20.041 --> 19:24.333
They have come all the way from Germany.

19:49.291 --> 21:01.709
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi; then the Puja starts]

28:15.709 --> 28:19.250
[during the Puja:] Husband and wife, are you? Ha?

28:19.667 --> 28:22.625
You both are husband and wife – are you?

28:23.041 --> 28:25.625
You have to be husband and wife! [Yogi: Yes!]

28:25.709 --> 28:31.709
Shri Mataji: You are? You both are husband and wife? [Yogi: Not!]

28:34.250 --> 28:39.709
Shri Mataji: Yes! [Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

28:40.166 --> 28:44.041
Means: the husband and wife should sit together!

28:44.625 --> 28:47.333
That’s the only time when a man and a woman

28:47.458 --> 28:51.166
sits together in this country. Not the brother.

28:51.458 --> 28:56.709
Not even sisters and brothers. Only husband and wife.

31:08.667 --> 31:18.125
[Puja continues]
