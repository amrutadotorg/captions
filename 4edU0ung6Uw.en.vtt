Shri Devi Puja. Rahuri (Hindistan)
26 Ocak 1984

00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:46.083
Rahuri has a special significance in the history of the Goddess,

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:55.166
that when the horrible rakshasa, called Rahu,

00:02:58.125 --> 00:03:02.333
started ruling this area and devastating it.

00:03:04.041 --> 00:03:09.125
The whole suffered, all the God-fearing people ….

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.583
Then the Goddess took Her incarnation

00:03:17.208 --> 00:03:21.709
here and She killed this man, this rakshasa

00:03:23.333 --> 00:03:25.250
and there are different places

00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:28.709
where how he ran, how She caught him

00:03:29.083 --> 00:03:33.709
and ultimately killed – he was killed in Rahuri.

00:03:34.291 --> 00:03:40.250
And that’s why rahu-ri – “ri” starts from the Hrim,

00:03:41.166 --> 00:03:44.333
as you know that: Aim, Klim, Hrim

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.333
are the three words denoting the three powers of the Goddess.

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.041
Aim, Hrim and Klim: Aim is the Mahakali,

00:03:55.625 --> 00:04:01.709
Hrim is the Mahalakshmi and Klim is the Mahasaraswati.

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.583
So, with the Hrim-power She killed this rakshasa,

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.250
and then – after that killing –

00:04:12.125 --> 00:04:14.333
bhaktas started living here.

00:04:15.125 --> 00:04:17.500
And a king came all the way from Rajpur,

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.709
Rajputana – and started worshipping the Goddess.

00:04:26.583 --> 00:04:32.041
And went – he was a poor man, he came here as a poor man –

00:04:33.583 --> 00:04:37.041
while worshipping the Goddess

00:04:39.583 --> 00:04:42.709
he raised this again into another kingdom,

00:04:43.542 --> 00:04:46.583
and that’s why they are called as Shalivahanas

00:04:46.709 --> 00:04:50.041
because they carry the shawl of the Goddess.

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:57.375
This Shalivahanas, later on in the dynasty, was a [INDIST., SOUNDS LIKE Bhobruvaha]

00:04:57.709 --> 00:05:00.333
who fought with the [INDIST. SOUNDS LIKE Maharaja]

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:04.041
and defeated him, who was from Ujiara [?]. Surprisingly

00:05:04.458 --> 00:05:07.125
many of My relations are still in Ujiara

00:05:07.458 --> 00:05:10.208
and they are following a new vision.

00:05:12.333 --> 00:05:15.333
So because he fought him

00:05:15.542 --> 00:05:21.041
and he captured him

00:05:21.333 --> 00:05:24.208
many people from here shifted there

00:05:24.375 --> 00:05:29.458
and settled down in Ujiara.

00:05:31.083 --> 00:05:36.667
Now this Rahuri developed gradually

00:05:39.041 --> 00:05:42.125
into a very modern city,

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.709
or you can say in a modernized.

00:05:47.333 --> 00:05:52.500
And when we go to [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE Nankhara] you will be able to see it.

00:05:53.083 --> 00:05:55.709
The forefathers

00:05:56.333 --> 00:05:58.625
of Mine were called as Shalivahanas

00:05:59.041 --> 00:06:03.125
and My mother`s place [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE Rhaduvas] where they resided and lived.

00:06:03.333 --> 00:06:07.041
So Rahuri has a special significance

00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:11.041
in the life of Sahaja Yoga, or I should say in My own life.

00:06:12.083 --> 00:06:16.542
And that is why surprisingly that in Rahuri we have established

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:21.291
our center in the biggest way.

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:24.291
Because the kings here worshipped

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:29.500
the Mother with a shawl.

00:06:30.166 --> 00:06:35.041
Now this has a special meaning as the significance

00:06:35.333 --> 00:06:38.041
goes, or you can say the symbolic - it is -

00:06:38.208 --> 00:06:41.208
it covers the modesty of the Mother.

00:06:42.208 --> 00:06:45.709
Mother protects us, She looks after us.

00:06:46.333 --> 00:06:49.041
So this is the one which covers Her,

00:06:49.333 --> 00:06:53.166
gives Her the grace,

00:06:53.709 --> 00:06:57.291
gives Her the protection from the cold

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.709
and when the children are suffering,

00:07:01.125 --> 00:07:06.333
or are tired, or are sick She covers them with the shawl.

00:07:07.458 --> 00:07:10.625
So the shawl has a very big meaning

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.458
and because the used to carry the shawl of the Mother

00:07:14.583 --> 00:07:16.709
all the time in their hands,

00:07:17.125 --> 00:07:20.000
that’s why they are called as Shalivahanas.

00:07:20.166 --> 00:07:22.542
So the significance of Rahuri is very great

00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:24.709
and you will also see that

00:07:25.166 --> 00:07:30.375
in the gross also the people here are very receptive to Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:30.709 --> 00:07:36.709
Even the factory people – I went to see them before I came here,

00:07:37.166 --> 00:07:40.083
to talk to them. And they are so much submerged

00:07:40.333 --> 00:07:42.291
in the developments of Sahaja Yoga

00:07:42.458 --> 00:07:44.458
and amount of things they want to do,

00:07:44.709 --> 00:07:47.709
and want to take advantage of Sahaja Yoga here.

00:07:48.041 --> 00:07:50.041
As they are built for you especially too

00:07:50.166 --> 00:07:53.583
was made with great care about from that they thought

00:07:54.041 --> 00:07:57.041
that it was finished and worked very hard.

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:01.000
Day and night, just to prepare this hall for you.

00:08:02.333 --> 00:08:04.375
So this is how it is going to work out,

00:08:04.583 --> 00:08:07.041
and last time I told them that you should not make

00:08:07.291 --> 00:08:10.583
an alcohol out of these molasses

00:08:10.709 --> 00:08:13.125
[??] and sell it at the market at a cheap rate,

00:08:13.375 --> 00:08:15.500
but make something useful.

00:08:15.709 --> 00:08:17.166
So they are trying to find out

00:08:17.333 --> 00:08:19.458
a technique about which I talked to them now.

00:08:19.709 --> 00:08:22.709
So they are very religious people also.

00:08:23.208 --> 00:08:25.333
And they are trying to improve the lot of the people,

00:08:25.542 --> 00:08:30.709
by removing all these addictions among the people.

00:08:32.709 --> 00:08:35.709
So that is the significance of Rahuri-Puja

00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:39.083
and that’s what it is, that you are like Shalivahanas

00:08:39.333 --> 00:08:44.667
who are worshipping the Mother and Her shawl.

00:08:45.542 --> 00:08:48.709
So today’s Puja has a special significance

00:08:49.458 --> 00:08:53.709
– that’s why Rahuri we have very good Sahaja Yogis here,

00:08:54.333 --> 00:09:00.166
very developed, very evolved, moral people.

00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:03.625
They are not scholars of Sanskrit,

00:09:04.041 --> 00:09:07.166
but they are scholars of Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:07.625 --> 00:09:12.208
There is a difference between being a scholar of Sanskrit

00:09:12.458 --> 00:09:14.542
and a scholar of Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:21.250
Now for you people I hope it has been a comfortable

00:09:21.625 --> 00:09:26.583
stay for you here and

00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:33.458
we hope also for the future you are going to enjoy

00:09:34.166 --> 00:09:39.041
your journey and enjoy the bliss of the Divine!

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:47.583
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

00:10:13.667 --> 00:10:15.542
We don’t read about Rahul`s killing,

00:10:15.709 --> 00:10:18.333
because it is Mahalakshmi who killed,

00:10:18.667 --> 00:10:22.709
but what we read in the Devi-Mahatmya is the Mahakali`s powers.

00:10:23.125 --> 00:10:27.041
But Rahul was killed here in Rahuri by Mahalakshmi,

00:10:27.709 --> 00:10:32.333
and that Mahalakshmi power is called as Hrim power,

00:10:32.709 --> 00:10:34.500
so that’s why this is Rahu-ri.

00:10:34.667 --> 00:10:40.250
Actually it is Rahu-hrim we can say it is Rahu-ri to make it simple.

00:10:41.333 --> 00:10:44.709
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

00:11:26.041 --> 00:11:28.000
And according to that calendar only

00:11:28.166 --> 00:11:30.709
all the Maharashtrians are living,

00:11:31.208 --> 00:11:35.667
which is very, I should say, much more subtler than vikram,

00:11:36.166 --> 00:11:38.625
this thing. Because in the [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: vikram-panjaga]

00:11:39.083 --> 00:11:43.000
this area is still called as Kali-Yuga, Kali-Yuga,

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:46.583
but in this [INDIST: SOUNDS LIKE: panjaga; Then: Shalivahana-Panjaga]

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.417
it is called as Krita-Yuga. It’s much subtler.

00:11:49.583 --> 00:11:53.667
That’s a very wider thing

00:11:54.041 --> 00:11:58.041
and it doesn’t give you the different sections

00:11:58.375 --> 00:12:01.333
of Kali-Yuga, that how it becomes Krita-Yuga

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.542
and ultimately a Satya-Yuga.

00:12:04.709 --> 00:12:11.709
The calendar that was used by the North Indians

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:15.709
was the Vikram, and the South Indians used the Shalivahana,

00:12:16.125 --> 00:12:20.583
but especially in Maharashtra. But the support came mainly from

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.333
[INDIST.] direct, who said that this is the better [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: panjaga]

00:12:25.625 --> 00:12:31.625
because it deals with subtler side of time.

00:12:32.291 --> 00:12:33.667
Subtler side of time.

00:12:34.125 --> 00:12:37.709
And that’s why it was regarded as a greater thing.

00:12:38.166 --> 00:12:43.458
Now on the first day of

00:12:43.709 --> 00:12:48.458
this calendar they put a kalasha

00:12:49.041 --> 00:12:55.041
[? A pot] with a shawl as a banner, a kalasha and a shawl as a banner.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:01.333
That’s why kalash, which is the Kundalini, is the Aquarius.

00:13:04.041 --> 00:14:26.083
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

00:14:27.041 --> 00:14:29.709
In the older days all the Maharashtrian women used to have

00:14:30.125 --> 00:14:35.709
some sort of an additional cloth, a shawl, which they used to carry.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.667
If it was a marriage then they used to have a marriage sari,

00:14:40.041 --> 00:14:41.709
[INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: completed with that shawl].

00:14:42.333 --> 00:14:46.291
All the time they had to wear something, a covering over the sari.

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.458
Sari was not the end-cloth but now we have become modern,

00:14:49.667 --> 00:14:54.709
so we don’t use the, that, another cloth which one has to use.

00:14:55.333 --> 00:14:57.709
So, but this is only the custom.

00:14:58.125 --> 00:15:01.250
In India is not the point, it is not only in Maharashtra, everywhere.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.709
But there, because a dress was not a sari,

00:15:04.166 --> 00:15:07.125
but those who bore the sari did not use, in the North.

00:15:07.375 --> 00:15:11.375
But here those who use the sari also use the shawl, on top of that.

00:15:11.667 --> 00:15:14.625
And that’s why, you see, this country has a speciality,

00:15:14.709 --> 00:15:18.125
this part that they always had this shawl,

00:15:18.291 --> 00:15:21.333
whether they went out, for their protection,

00:15:21.458 --> 00:15:22.709
or they went for a marriage

00:15:23.125 --> 00:15:26.166
or anything they used to have another thing on top.

00:15:26.458 --> 00:15:29.458
Now of course we have, symbolically, something modernized.

00:15:29.583 --> 00:15:32.333
This is, wearing little pieces to be used as shawls.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.458
You see, everything is getting modernized.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:16:13.709
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

00:18:08.709 --> 00:18:13.709
You must, all right, touch the feet of this Rahuri-Land.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:26.083
Then after, Ganesha, we must also touch the feet.

00:18:27.709 --> 00:18:31.291
As soon as I get the land, first we establish Ganesha here,

00:18:31.625 --> 00:18:33.250
and once this land, we get

00:18:33.417 --> 00:18:35.625
everywhere in the whole world, we get land

00:18:36.041 --> 00:18:39.667
and we have no problems of any kind as far as the land is concerned.

00:18:40.083 --> 00:18:43.667
When the Ashram is built here, everywhere in the whole world

00:18:44.041 --> 00:18:47.709
we’ll have Ashrams. So the beginning has to be at the right place.

00:19:02.333 --> 00:19:16.709
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

00:19:20.041 --> 00:19:24.333
They have come all the way from Germany.

00:19:49.291 --> 00:21:01.709
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi; then the Puja starts]

00:28:15.709 --> 00:28:19.250
[during the Puja:] Husband and wife, are you? Ha?

00:28:19.667 --> 00:28:22.625
You both are husband and wife – are you?

00:28:23.041 --> 00:28:25.625
You have to be husband and wife! [Yogi: Yes!]

00:28:25.709 --> 00:28:31.709
Shri Mataji: You are? You both are husband and wife? [Yogi: Not!]

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:39.709
Shri Mataji: Yes! [Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

00:28:40.166 --> 00:28:44.041
Means: the husband and wife should sit together!

00:28:44.625 --> 00:28:47.333
That’s the only time when a man and a woman

00:28:47.458 --> 00:28:51.166
sits together in this country. Not the brother.

00:28:51.458 --> 00:28:56.709
Not even sisters and brothers. Only husband and wife.

00:31:08.667 --> 00:31:18.125
[Puja continues]
