00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.000
How they work it out.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.640
This is the reason why when&nbsp;
Mohammad Sahib came in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.840
he preached that you should&nbsp;
not bow to anyone, whatsoever.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:58.102
Because bowing he knew that when the real person&nbsp;
will come, you will recognize him in any case.

00:00:58.102 --> 00:00:59.102
But there was a general view,&nbsp;
even Nanak Sahib could not change.

00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:02.880
And Nanak Sahib organized [UNCLEAR&nbsp;
a book] just a symbol of wisdom of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.342
many great souls that you can only go&nbsp;
and bow to that and not to anybody else.

00:01:09.342 --> 00:01:16.724
Preaching of Mohammad Sahib was just the same,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.724 --> 00:01:25.520
but the followers as usual&nbsp;
have committed such blunders&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.080
that it appears that they are not the followers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:39.840
but they are the enemies of&nbsp;
these great incarnations.&nbsp;

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.480
It is nice that in Sahaja Yoga&nbsp;
when you get self-realization,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:58.080
in the beginning, may not be but little later,&nbsp;
you start yourself feeling the pangs of sin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.240
and also of the sinful people.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.640
So you avoid the company of sinful people.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.760
You have to.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.520
If you remain in the company of sinful people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.040
then you know you get headaches,&nbsp;
you get agnya catching,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.320
you get all kinds of complications and&nbsp;
you want to run away from such a place.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.440
And nobody tells you that you run away&nbsp;
but you just run away you can’t bear it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:36.840
your body has become different.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:03:00.320
But the best way to strengthen yourself&nbsp;
is to be together as Sahaja Yogis.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:23.200
You must attend the programs when&nbsp;
there is a collective, aarti or puja&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.080
or meditation.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:37.920
You are seeing that when you collect&nbsp;
together something happens to you.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.840
If you sit at home and do&nbsp;
something, nothing works out much.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:04:02.160
Anywhere, when there are people sitting together&nbsp;
in meditation, Sahaja Yoga itself manifests,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.360
because it is a collective phenomenon.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.880
It is such a collective phenomenon.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.440
I will give an example of Gregoire, one day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:23.440
he was sitting with me and he was not feeling any&nbsp;
vibrations and he was very much worried about it.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.160
I was looking out from the&nbsp;
window and he was just facing me,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.160
and another Sahaja Yogi was&nbsp;
coming up the hill to my house.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.880
Immediately he said I am getting the vibrations.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.320
He said how is it suddenly&nbsp;
the vibrations have started?

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.880
I said look back and see who is coming.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.680
And he saw another Sahaja&nbsp;
Yogi plodding up the hill.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.840
His presence there, his coming&nbsp;
only, added to his vibrations.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.560
It is a collective phenomenon.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.280
How it works out collectively,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.080
why it works out collectively, is again a&nbsp;
question which is my job, it’s not yours.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.280
But I can say there’s a mathematics about it.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.000
There is a mathematics about it! You must know&nbsp;
that for everything there is a Mathematics.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.080
Everything works out in a mathematics.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.880
Why it is so?

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.600
It is being made like that.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:51.840
And Sahaja Yoga works out after, actually,&nbsp;
there are more than seven people.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:06:01.040
[Talks in Marathi].

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:19.840
You have to understand that how a&nbsp;
collective phenomenon works out.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:38.400
If there is a realized soul,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.400 --> 00:07:01.520
then he is surrounded by at least [UNCLEAR&nbsp;
2 or 3] divine [UNCLEAR beings], at least.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.080
But in certain cases when&nbsp;
there is a realized soul and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:14.000
he is not yet, say that good, say for&nbsp;
example if he smokes, take an example.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.320
And let’s say there is only&nbsp;
one following such a man.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:25.520
If all his chakras are bad and despite he smokes&nbsp;
also and he also drinks and things like that.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.840
Then maybe there is only one, maybe with&nbsp;
him or may not be even one sometimes.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.720
But mostly there’s at least&nbsp;
one, minimum one you can put it.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:46.080
So every realized soul has&nbsp;
got some people with them.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.680
And if somebody does some sinful act for a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.520
short time say for example, he does&nbsp;
something bad, actually very bad.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:01.200
Then all of them might depart for the time&nbsp;
being but they again come back to him.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:15.280
Now when such a man is struggling to have&nbsp;
a, an experience, if there is another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:27.520
positive person, a very positive person comes&nbsp;
in, he may be having more people with him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.400
so he may be able to spare some&nbsp;
of his people to prop up this man.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:44.880
So it acts like a, just like&nbsp;
the valencies of the atoms.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:53.840
But the only difference is between the&nbsp;
two is that human beings can accumulate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.400
as much as they want, they can change,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.360
but the atoms cannot change.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.840
Those people who just innocently commit some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:21.840
mistakes and something like that and they are&nbsp;
very active in Sahaja Yoga and good people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:36.320
they also find it difficult, hard, sometimes&nbsp;
to overcome their habits, it is so.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.800
So they must know if at that time&nbsp;
if they go to another Sahaja Yogi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:50.320
who does not have this habit, a particular&nbsp;
habit, say of eating the snuff, snuff taking.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.640
Another person does not have&nbsp;
this habit of snuff taking.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:04.240
Then the other person’s guides who are&nbsp;
hovering on him can help this man much more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.480
than the another person who is about to&nbsp;
take a snuff and if you go next to him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:13.120
then he’s already occupied and he’ll&nbsp;
take away all the three that you had.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.480
So you both will have a nice snuff taking.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.840
See.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.680
But they do not enter into your&nbsp;
psyche, the difference is this.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.520
They do not enter into your psyche, but&nbsp;
they bring about a cosmic change around.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:49.440
But supposing a person is suffering from bhoot&nbsp;
badha (negativity), or he has been to some gurus,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:55.600
so the guru will also fix certain&nbsp;
entities with that fellow.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.360
They tell us like that.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.360
Now, when this one is trying to do something bad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:12.320
then he will be supported by another&nbsp;
bhoot badha wala (a negative person).

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.880
The fraternity works very hard.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.160
You have seen the example of that in our groups.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.520
You see, if there is one&nbsp;
person who has a bhoot badha,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.160
you must ask Pradhan because&nbsp;
his son is suffering from that.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.320
He is so much interested in&nbsp;
people who have got bhoot badha.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.040
So, what happens such a&nbsp;
person when he goes and talks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:41.920
about his bhoot badha, the another one&nbsp;
will come immediately to support him.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:42.960
He will be forced up.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.040
There will be no freedom in it.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.720
He will just go, just like a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.360
magnet he will be attracted towards that&nbsp;
person who has a bhoot badha, immediately.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.240
And he becomes weak.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.200
Not only that, it can be that a&nbsp;
person who has a stronger bhoot badha&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:10.720
will attract a person of a smaller bhoot badha&nbsp;
and will influence and spoil that person.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.760
Now what is the difference?

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.800
In first case you have to choose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:21.680
to be in the company of a Sahaja&nbsp;
Yogi who does not have these habits.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:28.000
Say for example somebody&nbsp;
is a hot- tempered fellow.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:37.840
Such a man when he gets into hot-temper, if&nbsp;
he can think of somebody who is a very silent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:44.320
by temperament, immediately he will&nbsp;
be surprised, his temper will go away.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:49.680
If a man who is so silent that he does&nbsp;
not even mind his Mother being insulted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:57.200
and he feels bad about it that I can’t say&nbsp;
anything about it then such a man, if he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:05.840
thinks of someone who would not tolerate stuff&nbsp;
like this then immediately he gets the power.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.520
But the difference is very big.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.360
There is tremendous difference between the two.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.520
One you have to choose with&nbsp;
freedom, another you have forced it.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:24.320
But you’ll find so many Sahaja Yogis also, they&nbsp;
get attracted to negativity just like this.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:33.840
They don’t know how they get interested into that,&nbsp;
but to positivity they have to exert themselves.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.600
This is a thing and it is a&nbsp;
system which works out sometimes.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.400
That’s why I tell people&nbsp;
that do not keep combinations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.280
of the people who have the same weakness.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.640
When I say that people feel hurt sometimes.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.640
But you’ll find always, friendship is there.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.360
Say there are two Sahaja Yogis&nbsp;
who talk ill of Sahaja Yoga,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.080
morning till evening finding&nbsp;
faults with Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:12.000
They will combine together because&nbsp;
they keep a good company, you see.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.080
It is better to have diverse company so&nbsp;
that you supplement each other better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:26.400
than to be attracted towards people who are&nbsp;
of the same nature especially from one family.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:32.240
Supposing they are people of one family, so&nbsp;
you don’t discuss Sahaja Yoga among them.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.680
Either they will fight or they will&nbsp;
combine together in Sahaja Yoga.&nbsp;

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:47.200
So best thing to do in Sahaja Yoga is to&nbsp;
first find out your faults, sitting down.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.840
Write it down what are my faults?

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.800
These are my defects.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.840
Somebody is a show off, he shows off all the time.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:15:03.920
You see he must say something to show off,&nbsp;
now another show off should run away from him.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:11.840
He should sit with a person who is a shy person.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:23.120
And this is another style which is very&nbsp;
different from that of the negative people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:29.120
because in negativity, two negatives must&nbsp;
join together nicely to become real negative.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:39.840
But in Sahaja Yoga two opposites&nbsp;
must meet to be good Sahaja Yogis.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:44.800
But this must be done&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:53.840
in complete freedom, in complete understanding.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:16:00.251
[He must do it in freedomtalks in Marathi].

00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:06.960
What is the realm of being good Sahaja Yogis?

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.000
In one word you can understand.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.000
Only one small thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:21.840
is to be responsible.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:33.520
If you are a responsible Sahaja&nbsp;
Yogi, you will find your own way.

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.880
If you are not, you will go to doom.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:44.160
Because if you are responsible then&nbsp;
only God is going to give you more.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.800
If you behave irresponsibly,&nbsp;
you talk irresponsibly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.120
if you do not think what&nbsp;
you can do for Sahaja Yoga,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:11.825
you just come to Sahaja Yoga as a sort of a&nbsp;
liability on Sahaja Yoga, and you always go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:11.825 --> 00:17:23.330
like those are responsible… [ They have not&nbsp;
done it so how can I do-talks in Marathi].

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:26.866
She should have done it, why should I?

00:17:26.866 --> 00:17:28.169
What can I do?

00:17:28.169 --> 00:17:30.961
I mean who is he, who are you?

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:35.520
He is a Sahaja Yogi, you are also a Sahaja Yogi.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:45.840
The people who are responsible&nbsp;
in every way, in their behaviour.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:51.040
Mohammad Sahib has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:59.840
very very particular on this and he did say very&nbsp;
clearly that while doing Namaz in the presence of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:06.240
the divine you should not budge&nbsp;
even from where you are sitting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:14.000
you should not move, your&nbsp;
eyes should not rove about,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.440
you should not yawn.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:25.040
There are so many things if you ask me I can’t&nbsp;
even tell you how many things he has said it.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:34.800
To all the details in behaviour&nbsp;
he has said great things.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:45.920
Once you start feeling responsible you&nbsp;
yourself will know how to behave, what to do,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:47.680
what not to do.

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:55.840
Then, when you are responsible you will be&nbsp;
amazed you will drop out most of your habits,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.960
automatically, any habit.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.040
Supposing somebody is a very talkative person.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.240
That habit will drop out because&nbsp;
you will find out that by talking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.400
too much sometimes you are committing mistakes.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.840
So it comes to a balance.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.040
If somebody doesn’t talk at all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.120
he will find being responsible that&nbsp;
it doesn’t help, you have to talk.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.920
He starts talking.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.160
Only one word is to be responsible.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.680
Once you take the responsibility&nbsp;
of Sahaja yoga on your shoulders,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:44.480
immediately all the dimensions&nbsp;
of your new life will open out.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.680
Knowledge will pour into you.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.200
You will get related to life in a new way.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.160
And a new style of understanding will develop.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.840
The subtleties of life will open out before you.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:16.320
The joy will pour onto you, when you will sleep,&nbsp;
you feel as if the Ganges (a holy river) is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:26.785
flowing over your Sahasrara, the Jamuna&nbsp;
(a holy river) is washing your feet.

00:20:26.785 --> 00:20:31.200
You really feel that.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.680
But you have to be responsible.

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:47.760
I see very young people also being very… our&nbsp;
Moresco is a very responsible boy, he is so young.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:56.400
Whatever is possible he would&nbsp;
like to do for Sahaja Yogis,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.560
he is so very young, he is so responsible.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.600
For that you don’t have to have money, don’t&nbsp;
have to have anything but to be responsible.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:12.720
That doesn’t mean that if you come to my house&nbsp;
ten times and if you are with me, next to my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.400
room, then you are responsible.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.840
This is a wrong idea.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:22.640
Responsible also means that others should be given&nbsp;
chance, others should be there, why should I?

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:34.400
And when you start leading a&nbsp;
responsible Sahaja Yogi life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.920
thousands of evolved souls will hover around you.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.840
You will have a different light on your face.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:48.160
You will be amazed when you speak you&nbsp;
will be amazed that how you are speaking.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:55.360
How things are happening, how at every&nbsp;
moment how things are working out.

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.880
As it is you know how things&nbsp;
are Sahaja, how it works out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:04.560
you know that every moment it is working.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:08.640
Only you are for a simple to&nbsp;
be responsible on the stage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:12.960
otherwise there will be thousands&nbsp;
of them working for you.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.680
There are very few people on the stage.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.040
Behind the stage, there are thousands.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:27.240
The example is of these three&nbsp;
people in Rahuri (India).

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.240
How responsible they are and how&nbsp;
responsibly they have behaved.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.400
And when you start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:46.640
thinking on those lines that I am responsible&nbsp;
for this, just find out ways and methods.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:50.160
If you think you are responsible for your family,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.840
you will find out all the ways and&nbsp;
methods for running your family.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.200
But now you are responsible for Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:09.560
The sense of responsibility can only come through&nbsp;
your freedom, this is the problem of Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:15.280
But for a negative person it comes&nbsp;
to him automatically jolly well.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:26.040
Everyone I have seen these guru is negatively&nbsp;
charged, he just starts talking about it.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.200
He may not have seen his guru&nbsp;
at all, he may not have got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:35.040
one pie worth of things of, but&nbsp;
he will be talking about it.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.120
You ask him what has happened,&nbsp;
what is he good at and nothing.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.720
Because he is negatively&nbsp;
charged, there is no freedom.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.840
Does that mean that in freedom&nbsp;
human beings cannot be responsible?

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.520
Is it that human beings are not&nbsp;
yet evolved to be responsible?

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.440
They must be dominated by somebody or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:17.840
driven by somebody otherwise they&nbsp;
cannot do something responsibly.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:33.280
So in Sahaja Yoga when we think of our&nbsp;
own development and our own emancipation.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.160
We have to be responsible.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:45.840
I did not say anything to you at all.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.760
I even feel very hurt while&nbsp;
saying anything to you.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.760
I don’t like it.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:59.840
Because it is not a good taste&nbsp;
for me to say anything to anyone.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:05.280
I know many a times, many things I know about&nbsp;
because it is not good for me to talk like that.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.960
After all it is very hard to&nbsp;
be a mother and a teacher.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.560
It is a very very difficult task.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:11.360
You have no idea.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:17.800
Because I love you so much I can’t&nbsp;
bear to say something harsh to you.

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:21.680
If I say anything I feel very hurt&nbsp;
and I weep sometimes I have to say.

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:27.840
If you could be little responsible more every day.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:34.320
Every person must think that at least&nbsp;
10 persons I must bring to Sahaja yoga.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.360
It is our responsibility.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:44.960
Ten persons I must bring to Sahaja yoga and&nbsp;
in such a manner that they are done up well.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:46.720
They are prepared well.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.000
They are ready.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.040
Find out the ways and methods..

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:59.920
Nobody has given me any schemes as to how&nbsp;
to increase the activities of Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.640
Sit down, think about it.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:10.960
I have already told that one method&nbsp;
would be to have a program in a house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:15.280
of a Sahaja Yogi and all of you&nbsp;
should go there and invite the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:23.840
neighbors saying that in our house&nbsp;
we are going to have a program.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:31.536
Even for a small haldi-kumkumyou&nbsp;
can get at least 500 women easily.

00:26:31.536 --> 00:26:33.120
So for Sahaja&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:33.680
you can.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.640
Find out ways and methods.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.360
Find out ways and methods.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:54.400
How you can bring more people to Sahaja Yoga?

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:07.200
One person is more responsible than another.

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:19.840
It should not be so.

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:33.840
And there are so many other things&nbsp;
which you should also understand.

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.200
For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:48.320
people write letters to me about&nbsp;
lots of things I have to meditate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:53.280
I have to do some penances so I have&nbsp;
to write book, like that, I am busy.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.120
You know I do not spare myself much.

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.800
I do not write letters back.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:59.920
Sometimes I cannot.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:04.920
Even if you do not receive a&nbsp;
letter you will be looked after.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.020
Remember that.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.073
But you must write letters.

00:28:08.073 --> 00:28:11.593
There are people who just do not write letters.

00:28:11.593 --> 00:28:12.766
I have seen it.

00:28:12.767 --> 00:28:14.160
Just do not write.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.840
You must learn to write letters.

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:19.440
Today I received a very sweet letter&nbsp;
from Mrs Knight and her husband.

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.880
It is like a puja.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.000
So beautiful it was.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.200
You must write beautiful letters This&nbsp;
is not the way to be responsible.

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.200
Just you do not write.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:49.160
At least minimum you should write letters to me&nbsp;
and to other Sahaja Yogis thatI would say Shirayu&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.400
she is very responsible.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.240
I never write to her, seldom I have time.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:56.960
She writes to me.

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.720
She has so many problems.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.400
She has her children, she has her husband.

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.960
But she writes to me beautiful letters.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.600
And even if I do not write&nbsp;
to her she never minds me.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.080
[UNCLEAR] If she was not&nbsp;
have written letters to me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.080
she would not have composed such beautiful poems.

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.040
Another is Raul Bai.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.960
I seldom have time to write to her.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:20.880
But she writes to me.

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:27.840
If I cannot answer you, you&nbsp;
should not feel bad about it.

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.440
This is one thing you must decide.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:33.680
That your Mother is very&nbsp;
pre-occupied, and She is very busy.

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:40.080
Your letters of course give me great&nbsp;
happiness and you must write to me.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.680
But people seldom write.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.040
Seldom.

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.000
Very few people really write to me.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.960
And they have no time for writing letters you see.

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:53.840
This is not the way.

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.960
Now I will tell you the secret.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.440
It is very very simple.

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.600
You have read so many scriptures and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.560
have read Ishwar Stuti or Devi Stuti&nbsp;
all these things you have read.

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.720
What do we write on our invitation cards?

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:24.341
Come [UNCLEAR].

00:30:24.341 --> 00:30:34.880
Jagadamba Prasanna (pleased).

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:44.000
That is the Mother is in&nbsp;
such pleasures you can say.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.680
She has been so happy.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.840
Or She is very happy about it.

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:54.320
So you must just find out&nbsp;
what will make Mother happy.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.680
What makes me happy.

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:07.360
When you do something just weigh it out,&nbsp;
will She be happy if we do like this.

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.720
If we talk like this and say like these things.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:11.600
Will She be happy?

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.000
It is very simple.

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:18.080
You know me too well that&nbsp;
I am not going to like it.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:21.840
I may not say about it, I may keep quiet.

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.120
But I am not going to like it.

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.600
That is a very good judging point.

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.160
Do not do what you want to do and you like it.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:35.920
That is a wrong style.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:36.800
Absolutely wrong.

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.680
But you must do what I would like you to do.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:45.840
And you know Me very well.

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:54.480
And that is what it should be&nbsp;
that Mataji Prasanna(pleased).

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.720
This is a sort of a certificate as&nbsp;
we take as we write Mataji Prasanna.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:04.240
In our house such and such&nbsp;
wedding is going to take place.

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.200
That She is happy.

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:13.840
So do everything with that permission.

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:18.240
As it is I am very happy I must say this time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:24.400
because you have opened out very much this&nbsp;
time and there has been a big progress.

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:28.800
There is a big rise.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:42.640
But it should be done regularly,&nbsp;
and it must be kept up.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.680
I do not know how to tell you&nbsp;
what has happened to you actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:55.840
because it is a very big&nbsp;
process which came into play.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.800
And it has worked out very well.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:04.640
And now you will be seeing your&nbsp;
small small faults of your chakras&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.720
which you are separated from and&nbsp;
you are not bothered about it.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:15.280
So, when you have a problem on your chakras&nbsp;
try to clear them and keep them clean.

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:21.920
And respect yourself and your&nbsp;
responsibilities as Sahaja yogis.

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:30.240
This is a very historical&nbsp;
meeting of very very few people.

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:42.000
And everything that we have done&nbsp;
here has been of great help.

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:52.480
Carry no malice in your heart but joy&nbsp;
that you found a place where there is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:06.751
a goodwill of so many Sahaja&nbsp;
yogis who are realized souls.

00:34:06.751 --> 00:34:18.720
And when they increase in number the ratio&nbsp;
increases of the evolved souls who surround them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:21.840
in multiple proportions.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:25.440
Or you can say geometrical proportions, that&nbsp;
is the correct way, that is mathematics.

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:34.480
So, the more you are the better it&nbsp;
is and it is now your responsibility&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:41.040
to be wise and to show some results&nbsp;
till I am in Bombay and also in India.

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:46.800
Let us see now everybody, how he goes about.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:50.120
And the programs are going to&nbsp;
be in Bharatiya Vidhya Bhawan.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:56.960
Sometimes it shocks Me when I see that in big&nbsp;
programs Sahaja yogis are the last to come.

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:02.440
All the rest of the people are&nbsp;
there and Sahaja yogis are missing.

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:08.000
So first of all find out ten people&nbsp;
who will come for Sahaja yoga.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:14.000
Next program I do not know he will announce it&nbsp;
where it is I do not know we have not yet decided.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:25.440
[3 &amp; 4 in Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan &amp; 2 – 4 in&nbsp;
Ghatkopar- talks in MarathiConversation with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:30.973
another yogi in Marathi].

00:35:30.973 --> 00:35:34.720
In Bharatiya Vidhya Bhawan three and four.

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:37.520
So you should find out people&nbsp;
why they are doing like this.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:40.080
Why should not they come&nbsp;
into it and go ahead with it.

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:47.520
I even know Sahaja yogis which are lost you can&nbsp;
go and talk to them and work it out if possible.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:48.800
If not, forget them.

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:52.640
Let new people talk to them and&nbsp;
tell them about Sahaja yoga.

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:59.760
And I hope this three and four&nbsp;
will be a very good program.

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.320
Now everybody should be responsible.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:05.600
Should find out if somebody needs&nbsp;
flowers somebody can bring flowers.

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:12.240
Somebody can bring UdBatti (lncense sticks),&nbsp;
somebody can bring something for the program.

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:17.360
And somebody can bring… You see even when I go&nbsp;
there then the adjustment starts of the radio&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:21.360
and there this thing and that thing and&nbsp;
such a waste of time and that is not good.

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.080
But it is you see we find faults with others.

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.960
We never find out ourselves&nbsp;
what we have done about it.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:30.160
You see supposing somebody has&nbsp;
not brought say the loudspeaker.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.440
So that fellow has not brought the&nbsp;
loudspeaker so it is very wrong you see.

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.440
But what have you done about it?

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:38.080
Have you done something about it,&nbsp;
have you found out something about it?

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.320
And if everybody works it out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:47.440
how to decorate, how to put&nbsp;
it right and everything,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:51.440
how we are going to expand it,&nbsp;
then the things will be alright.

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:57.840
Another program which all of you should know&nbsp;
is on the 21st of March and I would like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.080
all the other people to also come.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:04.480
You can bring some people from&nbsp;
Rahuri, those people who want to come.

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.840
21st of March.

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:12.010
19, 20 and 21.

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:18.960
At least if you can come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.945
for one day it is alright [if you come in&nbsp;
2-3 days then also fine upto that we will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:21.945 --> 00:37:22.075
find place to live so problem of living will get&nbsp;
solve-conversation with another yogi in Marathi].

00:37:22.075 --> 00:37:25.281
19, 20, 21 we can have regular&nbsp;
three-day program in that place.

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:35.840
But in any case we organize something&nbsp;
better this time 19, 20, 21.

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:40.948
[Now we have program in Delhi, ask those people&nbsp;
– conversation with another yogi in Hindi].
