1
00:00:00,169 --> 00:00:03,076
Shakti Puja, Togliatti (Russia), 3 August 1993.

2
00:15:08,804 --> 00:15:14,917
Today it is such a great day for our Being,

3
00:15:15,117 --> 00:15:21,332
to be with you all again this year.

4
00:15:30,877 --> 00:15:42,888
It’s so very joyous and full of fragrance.

5
00:15:52,454 --> 00:16:00,040
Today we have decided to have a Puja of Shakti that is the power,

6
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,388
that is the Devi.

7
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:26,762
You know within us there are many powers

8
00:16:26,962 --> 00:16:34,876
of Maha Kali, Maha Saraswati, Maha Lakshmi, Kundalini.

9
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:53,410
All these powers are there for us to ascent.

10
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:31,699
If these powers are properly used and understood,

11
00:17:31,899 --> 00:17:38,759
then your ascent can be permanent.

12
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:50,875
Once you achieve your ascent

13
00:17:51,075 --> 00:17:54,648
and enter into the kingdom of God,

14
00:17:54,848 --> 00:17:59,481
all these powers get enlightened.

15
00:18:06,197 --> 00:18:14,919
And these powers which are enlightened

16
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:23,283
are absolutely filled with Love.

17
00:18:33,369 --> 00:18:37,909
Enlightenment, we have to understand that

18
00:18:38,109 --> 00:18:43,273
we get completely enlightened by Love.

19
00:18:50,593 --> 00:18:54,572
So after enlightenment, after realisation,

20
00:18:54,772 --> 00:19:00,866
we use only one power which is of Love.

21
00:19:09,325 --> 00:19:16,059
Shri Rama had two sons: one was Lav and one was Kush.

22
00:19:20,278 --> 00:19:25,929
One of them, Lav, came to Russia.

23
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:33,452
That’s why you are called as Slavs, means ‘with love’.

24
00:19:37,828 --> 00:19:49,428
So Russian people are already quite full of their heart with love.

25
00:19:54,832 --> 00:20:00,445
But once you get your enlightenment

26
00:20:00,645 --> 00:20:05,617
you realise that your love becomes

27
00:20:05,817 --> 00:20:12,746
a beautiful ocean of joy for yourself.

28
00:20:22,982 --> 00:20:30,587
This love is not the same which you had before enlightenment.

29
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:45,573
It’s transformed into a new dimension, into a new form.

30
00:20:47,894 --> 00:20:52,827
Before enlightenment you are attached to yourself,

31
00:20:53,027 --> 00:20:56,952
first of all, very much: to your body, to your mind,

32
00:20:57,152 --> 00:21:03,264
to your conditionings, to your intellect, to your ego.

33
00:21:12,808 --> 00:21:15,944
And that is how you develop

34
00:21:16,144 --> 00:21:24,165
darkness of many horrible things within yourself.

35
00:21:29,344 --> 00:21:31,700
If you are too much attached to your body,

36
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,947
then you may eat too much or you may not eat at all

37
00:21:35,147 --> 00:21:38,086
or you may exercise too much

38
00:21:38,287 --> 00:21:46,100
or you may work it out for a particular form of your figure.

39
00:21:57,183 --> 00:22:01,819
And you will use your body for absolutely wrong things

40
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:06,222
or sinful things also.

41
00:22:10,825 --> 00:22:14,219
But then you become enlightened

42
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:20,488
and you understand that your body is the temple of God.

43
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:33,629
Then you keep your body clean and also you try to avoid

44
00:22:33,829 --> 00:22:39,079
all that is destructive for your body.

45
00:22:47,442 --> 00:22:52,201
The another attachment we have is very limited,

46
00:22:52,402 --> 00:22:56,702
say for your own family, for your children, for your wife,

47
00:22:56,902 --> 00:23:01,548
for your husband, something like that.

48
00:23:09,923 --> 00:23:14,688
Despite that a human being can be extremely selfish

49
00:23:14,889 --> 00:23:17,481
and could only bother about himself

50
00:23:17,681 --> 00:23:22,946
and first of all him and then the rest.

51
00:23:32,181 --> 00:23:36,750
Also he may spoil his children or spoil her husband

52
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:46,101
or his wife in any way just to pamper their ego.

53
00:23:58,044 --> 00:24:03,078
Some people might indulge into alcoholism

54
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:07,527
or drugs or all kinds of things.

55
00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:20,628
Also to help their families they may draw other people,

56
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:33,899
because they are very self-centered and their vision is very narrow.

57
00:24:37,975 --> 00:24:42,617
Sometimes they discover that for those people for whom

58
00:24:42,818 --> 00:24:50,005
they are doing wrong things, are not actually bother about them.

59
00:24:58,527 --> 00:25:03,405
Then there’s enlightenment and they see for themselves

60
00:25:03,605 --> 00:25:06,639
that whatever I’m doing is neither good for me

61
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:11,387
nor for my family, nor my relations.

62
00:25:21,314 --> 00:25:26,361
After enlightenment you think collectively.

63
00:25:29,032 --> 00:25:32,996
Also when you think about your wife and your children,

64
00:25:33,196 --> 00:25:38,876
your family, you think what is the right thing for them to do.

65
00:25:47,644 --> 00:25:52,078
Immediately you become attentive to their problems

66
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:56,364
and to their destructiveness.

67
00:26:05,013 --> 00:26:10,989
Then this power of love changes the whole atmosphere.

68
00:26:13,884 --> 00:26:18,840
In the family people see how sacrificing you are

69
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:23,164
and how noble you are.

70
00:26:30,664 --> 00:26:37,271
This nobility is seen very clearly among Sahaja Yogis.

71
00:26:42,021 --> 00:26:46,893
In that noble understanding of life

72
00:26:47,093 --> 00:26:55,856
they try to be extremely patient, sweet in the family

73
00:26:56,056 --> 00:27:01,407
and try to bring them to the right path.

74
00:27:11,512 --> 00:27:18,545
At the same time when they are helping their families

75
00:27:18,746 --> 00:27:24,546
and try to improve their understanding,

76
00:27:24,747 --> 00:27:30,891
they can be also very particular as to see that

77
00:27:31,115 --> 00:27:40,842
they do not allow over indulgence into their family.

78
00:27:50,242 --> 00:27:54,578
Because of the enlightenment, there’s detachment.

79
00:27:59,047 --> 00:28:03,951
And the power of detached love is the greatest.

80
00:28:06,717 --> 00:28:11,389
It’s like the sap in the trees which rises from the Mother Earth,

81
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:16,616
goes up into the smallest of leaves

82
00:28:16,816 --> 00:28:23,459
and then it is either evaporated or goes back to the Mother Earth.

83
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,371
It doesn’t stay in one flower

84
00:28:37,571 --> 00:28:44,957
because it likes it or in one leaf because it likes it.

85
00:28:51,645 --> 00:28:55,773
It nourishes every part of the tree, whatever is need,

86
00:28:55,973 --> 00:29:00,294
and is not attached.

87
00:29:05,156 --> 00:29:12,183
But supposing it gets entangled or involved in one flower

88
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:15,871
or in one leaf, the tree will die

89
00:29:16,071 --> 00:29:20,899
and that leaf and that flower will also die.

90
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:36,688
So detached love only gives, doesn’t expect anything back.

91
00:29:41,344 --> 00:29:46,571
If it expects anything is complete prosperity

92
00:29:46,771 --> 00:29:54,060
and the goodness of the tree.

93
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:03,672
In the same way a saintly person, who is a Sahaja Yogi,

94
00:30:03,872 --> 00:30:07,571
behaves towards his family, towards his friends,

95
00:30:07,771 --> 00:30:11,801
towards everything.

96
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:24,319
We have used only the power of hatred so far.

97
00:30:27,428 --> 00:30:30,845
In the politics, especially, one country believes that

98
00:30:31,045 --> 00:30:36,100
they must hate another country, they are born for that.

99
00:30:41,793 --> 00:30:44,020
Because hundred years back

100
00:30:44,221 --> 00:30:47,859
some quarrel took place or a war took place,

101
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:52,780
so the children are still fighting among themselves.

102
00:30:58,936 --> 00:31:02,823
You’ll be amazed that when I first came to Russia,

103
00:31:03,023 --> 00:31:10,038
25 German Sahaja Yogis rushed to help Me here.

104
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:22,092
Instead of bearing that malice in their hearts,

105
00:31:22,292 --> 00:31:25,842
as their forefathers had killed so many of Russians,

106
00:31:26,042 --> 00:31:31,800
they felt it was their greatest wishes to go

107
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,972
and do some service for the Russians.

108
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:55,614
So all the hatred changes into this powerful Love.

109
00:32:01,177 --> 00:32:07,230
This power of Love is the greatest power and after Sahaja Yoga,

110
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:12,609
we have to use only our power of Love.

111
00:32:18,029 --> 00:32:26,108
It’s the most powerful, effective weapon that we have.

112
00:32:30,022 --> 00:32:34,303
Because this is Divine Love.

113
00:32:36,657 --> 00:32:39,035
We are getting the source of Divine Love

114
00:32:39,235 --> 00:32:44,688
from the all pervading power of God’s Love.

115
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:54,101
They say that God is Almighty.

116
00:32:56,556 --> 00:33:01,173
Then who can be more powerful than God?

117
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:07,064
And if we are connected with God Almighty,

118
00:33:07,264 --> 00:33:11,491
who could be mightier than us?

119
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:22,698
In His Love He protects us, He gives us whatever we want,

120
00:33:22,898 --> 00:33:28,939
He blesses us and He makes us enjoy ourselves.

121
00:33:36,673 --> 00:33:43,938
His government is the most efficient
one and is very quick and very fast.

122
00:33:47,584 --> 00:33:52,126
Today only when I was coming, one
of the Sahaja Yogis came and said,

123
00:33:52,326 --> 00:33:57,037
“Mother it is very cloudy, it may rain.”

124
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:05,999
And when I came out after five minutes

125
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,312
I found the whole sky is cleared out.

126
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:22,563
So all these five elements also are at
the disposal of the children of God.

127
00:34:27,008 --> 00:34:30,724
Even the cruellest of the cruel person melts down

128
00:34:30,924 --> 00:34:40,086
and comes to the humble understanding of this power.

129
00:34:45,852 --> 00:34:50,002
No one can harm you.

130
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:56,291
And anybody who tries to harm you becomes melted away.

131
00:35:00,948 --> 00:35:04,425
It is so many miracles that in this short speech

132
00:35:04,633 --> 00:35:06,919
I won’t be able to tell you all of them.

133
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:12,286
But you’ll find it in your life itself, how this power of Love,

134
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:18,030
that you have within your heart, has protected you.

135
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:29,835
I have seen people who are very hot tempered,

136
00:35:30,035 --> 00:35:35,105
who are angry type, who are all the
time making other’s life miserable,

137
00:35:35,306 --> 00:35:40,523
become extremely beautiful, nice people.

138
00:35:51,111 --> 00:35:56,591
With this Light of Love, you love yourself in the right way

139
00:35:56,791 --> 00:36:02,952
and give up all that is wrong, all that is immoral.

140
00:36:11,441 --> 00:36:16,209
This Love is eternal, is very powerful

141
00:36:16,409 --> 00:36:24,033
and gives you a confidence in the collectivity of human beings.

142
00:36:28,852 --> 00:36:37,000
Because it’s the Spirit which enlightens all your power.

143
00:36:40,402 --> 00:36:48,082
And the Spirit is the source of collectivity and love

144
00:36:48,282 --> 00:36:52,376
for every human being in the world.

145
00:36:57,426 --> 00:37:01,289
Then your attention goes to all the people who are in trouble,

146
00:37:01,489 --> 00:37:07,140
who are suffering, who need help.

147
00:37:12,892 --> 00:37:16,020
And with this attention, which is so enlightened,

148
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:21,487
you can solve their problems sitting down here.

149
00:37:27,687 --> 00:37:33,049
With such people there’s no need to have any wars,

150
00:37:33,249 --> 00:37:39,883
no need to have any weapons, no need to have any boundaries.

151
00:37:46,687 --> 00:37:51,906
If Russians go to India, they feel India as their country,

152
00:37:52,107 --> 00:37:58,035
if Indians come to Russia they think Russia their own country.

153
00:38:05,321 --> 00:38:09,338
So who will fight?

154
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:13,940
There’s no one to whom you can really say: “He is my enemy” ,

155
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:19,739
because everybody is part and parcel of your being.

156
00:38:28,883 --> 00:38:34,788
These are the special times, I call them the Blossom time

157
00:38:34,988 --> 00:38:41,426
when too many flowers are there who are seeking the Truth.

158
00:38:51,671 --> 00:38:57,141
And their fragrance is their Love.

159
00:39:00,501 --> 00:39:04,723
And they have all to become fruits now.

160
00:39:06,833 --> 00:39:09,811
And this is what is going to happen

161
00:39:10,012 --> 00:39:14,867
as these times are very, very important.

162
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:23,945
In all the religions they are described.

163
00:39:25,986 --> 00:39:30,208
We don’t hate anyone because we believe in one religion

164
00:39:30,408 --> 00:39:37,255
or another religion. On the contrary,
we believe in all the religions.

165
00:39:46,071 --> 00:39:49,910
This is the power by which a drop becomes the ocean

166
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:54,384
and individual becomes the collective.

167
00:40:01,278 --> 00:40:04,778
So all your powers that are there are enlightened

168
00:40:04,978 --> 00:40:09,111
by the all pervading power.

169
00:40:14,244 --> 00:40:22,468
It transforms you and it has such a beautiful, delicate way

170
00:40:22,668 --> 00:40:26,926
of handling everything.

171
00:40:34,269 --> 00:40:40,713
The only thing that is needed is faith in this power,

172
00:40:43,753 --> 00:40:48,436
that only by having Love for others,

173
00:40:48,636 --> 00:40:52,592
and this enlightened Love

174
00:40:52,792 --> 00:40:58,533
is going to give you whatever you want.

175
00:41:06,356 --> 00:41:11,262
And there is such a power, All-pervading power.

176
00:41:17,635 --> 00:41:21,850
There is no doubt about it.

177
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:26,305
And we have to just accept it with our open heart

178
00:41:26,505 --> 00:41:32,169
that it fills it and makes us a great personality.

179
00:41:38,431 --> 00:41:42,286
So there’s no competition, there’s no ambition,

180
00:41:42,486 --> 00:41:48,426
there’s no jealousy, nothing of the kind.

181
00:41:54,367 --> 00:41:59,495
The only desire then left is that "I am enjoying myself,

182
00:41:59,695 --> 00:42:03,726
let others also enjoy."

183
00:42:10,305 --> 00:42:15,859
People go out of the way to spread Sahaja Yoga.

184
00:42:19,398 --> 00:42:25,419
They work very hard, travel with very little money,

185
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:28,794
they try to convince people,

186
00:42:28,994 --> 00:42:34,786
do all kinds of things for no material gain.

187
00:42:42,684 --> 00:42:45,723
But the greatest joy is when you see that

188
00:42:45,923 --> 00:42:49,098
you have raised the Kundalini of another person

189
00:42:49,298 --> 00:42:53,978
and given him self-realisation.

190
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:06,039
That lits up your faces I have seen many times.

191
00:43:11,643 --> 00:43:17,081
Let this Love grow more and more.

192
00:43:20,329 --> 00:43:25,743
They asked me, why of all places I came to Togliatti.

193
00:43:29,313 --> 00:43:37,695
Not for Volga, not for these beautiful houses you have

194
00:43:37,895 --> 00:43:42,476
but for My children who are here.

195
00:43:49,241 --> 00:43:53,637
May God bless you.
