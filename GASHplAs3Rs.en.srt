1
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:40,090
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

2
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:47,090
When we are seeking the Truth we have to know
we have to be honest about it. Because it

3
00:00:54,610 --> 00:01:01,610
is benevolent for us, not for others. We are
seeking the Truth for ourselves, not for others.

4
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:12,199
The another thing we have to remember, very
humbly, that truth is what it is. We can not

5
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:23,020
change it, we can not organize it, we can
not maneuver it. It is what has been and will

6
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,490
be.

7
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:33,490
And what is the Truth? The truth is that you
are the Spirit. You are not this body, you

8
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:47,070
are not this mind, you are not this ego, and
you are not this conditioning. You are the

9
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:55,939
Spirit.
But so far you have been a humane being. But

10
00:01:56,329 --> 00:02:03,329
to be humane being itself is a very great
thing. Is the greatest thing – to be a humane

11
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:15,340
being. Perhaps we have not realized the value
of our life because we do not know what we

12
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:24,609
are. The way we waste our time, waste our
energies, waste our attention on things, which

13
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:35,670
are senseless, because we still have to understand
the greatness of our being. Humane beings

14
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:47,920
are made with such care, so beautifully, such
delicate working of the Divine from ameba

15
00:02:54,349 --> 00:03:00,459
to this stage passing through various stages,
such a beautiful thing has been created as

16
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:03,209
a humane being.

17
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:10,209
But first we must have this attention to our
Self that there must be something. It can

18
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:18,010
not be a purposelessly [WAY or DOING], it
can not be something just a chance. Is a wrong

19
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:25,870
idea to play with. If the gravitation force
of the Earth or anyone of the galaxies changes,

20
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:38,870
then be disaster, absolute disaster.

21
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:44,450
So many things in the cosmos, if you study,
the coefficients that works out, the different

22
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:51,450
balancing and the different weights and the
movements of the different bodies show us

23
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:58,870
that there must be some purpose. And they
do not trouble us; it’s all as if made for

24
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:06,299
the stage for humane beings. That the humane
beings have to come on the stage and all the

25
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:13,299
preparation is made for the great drama. I
think it’s high time that great scientists

26
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:22,120
should look at it and start wondering why
is it the way it is made. Why we are so much

27
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:29,909
looked after. The whole cosmos seems to be
within ourselves as if we have buttons, which

28
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:39,820
move the cosmos, which control the cosmos.
Everything is going on so smoothly otherwise,

29
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:46,690
except when we do not try to understand ourselves.

30
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:53,690
It has been said practically in all the Scriptures
that you have to seek your Self; you have

31
00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:04,009
to find your Self. Though I think many of
this Scriptures have been little bit changed

32
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:13,479
and have been used for certain purposes, still
they could not get over this point that you

33
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:21,570
have to become the Self, you have to be born
again.

34
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:28,570
But that is not an artificial thing. We are
humane beings not artificially made. We are

35
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:37,039
made really by some sort of a living force
from ameba. We are not just made with some

36
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:46,240
sort of a thinking or a mental projection.
It is not a mental projection by which we

37
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:53,020
have been humane beings, it is something spontaneously
happening, a living force within us, which

38
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:58,440
has brought us to this stage - with a purpose,
with a meaning.

39
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:05,440
And now at this stage we are free to do what
we like. Many people ask Me, “What was the

40
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:13,740
need to give this freedom to humane beings?”
It was very necessary. If you have to have

41
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:20,740
the ultimate freedom you must know how to
deal with it. You have to understand. Of course,

42
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:29,569
humane beings have to make mistakes. To err
is humane. And we have to understand that

43
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:37,630
this trial – error and trial and error business
– has made us understand, also those who

44
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:49,190
have not understood must understand, that
there must be a wiser or surer way to achieve

45
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,590
that goal of Self-Realization, of Self-knowledge.

46
00:06:53,590 --> 00:07:00,590
Self-knowledge we do not have, we must admit
very humbly, we have had no system by which

47
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:12,210
we could know ourselves. But think of a computer
that is a humane being is. As soon as you

48
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:19,840
see Me you know I am there. You don’t have
to go for programming, you don’t have to

49
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:26,840
consult anything, you don’t have to use
any kind of computer or some sort of a complicated

50
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:34,690
machinery, automatically, spontaneously in
a split of a second you know that I’m standing

51
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:40,639
before you and talking to you. Such a computer
we can not create. But the Divine has created

52
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,789
such a great computer and that is the humane
being. And this humane being is the only one

53
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:53,500
who is going to achieve that higher state,
which we call as the spiritual state of the

54
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,259
Self.

55
00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:02,259
Because in the science they deal with the
tree, I should say, the outside, but they

56
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:10,569
can not go into the roots. To go into the
roots you have to become a subtler being.

57
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:15,419
Unless and until you become a subtler being
you can not go into your roots to find out

58
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:22,419
what are your roots are. And that is what
is Self-Realization. When you become subtler

59
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:29,909
then only you can go into your being and can
find out what actually you are. Also to look

60
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:38,430
after a tree, which has not know its roots,
is a very difficult thing. What happens is

61
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:45,900
that when you do not know your roots and you
start growing, and growing, and growing you

62
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:52,900
go very deep down into that where you find
that you have lost your way. Actually you

63
00:08:55,390 --> 00:09:02,390
are not going deeper. You are spreading outside
more and more. And then once you start going

64
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,370
to extremes because of your freedom you lose
your way.

65
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:12,329
That’s how today everybody is saying, “A
shock is going to come”. You are all going

66
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:19,100
to face a shock. This is going to happen,
that is going to happen. But actually it is

67
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:25,850
absolutely in your hands because the whole
of the cosmos is within you. The cosmos is

68
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:32,850
working under your control complete. It is
absolutely looking after you. Every element

69
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:41,049
is looking after you to preserve you, to guide
you, to take you to the right thinking.

70
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:47,530
But in your freedom you have to achieve that.
This is a very big condition and there where

71
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:52,850
we fail to understand. Even there are many
who say, “There is nothing like Divine”

72
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:59,089
and, “There is nothing like God.” In Russia
I’ve been and I’ve been to China and all

73
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:06,089
the communist countries and they are in a
way partially justify it. Because what they

74
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:13,199
found, those people who talk of God, those
who say that, “We believe in God” and

75
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:20,750
those who say that, “We believe in religion”,
can be irreligious. Anybody who can call himself

76
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:28,500
a Christian, Hindu, Muslim, say, Farsi, anything,
is capable of any sin. Whatever he wants to

77
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:35,500
do he can do it. Nobody can say that, “Because
he was a Christian he could not do it”.

78
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:44,299
So the whole concept of religion becomes a
mental projection again an artificial thing.

79
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:53,540
But if a person is a Self-Realized person
he goes beyond that, beyond temptations, beyond

80
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:03,640
any kind of domination of any habits. He becomes
a very strong person, very powerful person

81
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:13,360
and extremely compassionate. His compassion
is active. Is not a compassion that, “I’ll

82
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:21,679
form a charitable institution, which lends
money to people”, is not like that. The

83
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:28,890
being itself emits compassion and this compassion
acts, acts and works out. For example you

84
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:36,890
become like a light which gives light to people
and to yourself. You know others and you know

85
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:42,809
yourself. That is the light of the Truth and
unless and until that happens one should not

86
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:49,809
say that, “I’m a Self-Realized soul”
or, “I am a twice born” – is artificial.

87
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:58,100
So what you have to understand that we are
living in a relative world. We talk relatively.

88
00:12:01,439 --> 00:12:08,439
We have to be in the absolute world, where
the Truth is absolute. There now before you

89
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:15,790
I’m standing, you know very well that I’m
wearing a sari, which is white. But it’s

90
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:21,079
a relative still because somebody will say,
“Oh, maybe it’s white”. Somebody will

91
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:28,079
say, “It’s of white”, somebody will
say like that. Still you know something, but

92
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:35,620
to know it absolutely, meticulously the right
thing, you have to be the Spirit. But what

93
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:42,290
you know is much more than these eyes can
see or this nose can smell. Is much more,

94
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:49,290
much more explicit, much more clear cut. Like
a person who is suffering, say, from some

95
00:12:53,179 --> 00:13:00,179
disease. A child is suffering from some disease
and they don’t know what the disease is.

96
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:09,110
So they have to go many various kinds of tests
and for that the gentlemen, the father, or

97
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,520
the mother, they have to pay a lot of money.
They go on finding about the child, what’s

98
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,010
wrong, what’s wrong, what’s wrong. They
can not find it, what’s wrong with the child.

99
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:23,870
And they are so upset about it and within
three days a child dies and still the diagnoses

100
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:30,870
is not coming. Is a very common thing. But
when you are a Self-Realized soul you can

101
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:38,770
know what’s wrong with the child, exactly
you can put down your finger on the problem

102
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:43,270
that he has.

103
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:48,470
Now how does it happen? Here is already told
you about the charkas that we have, the centers

104
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:54,579
within us. These are the centers, which on
one side control the cosmos, on the other

105
00:13:54,579 --> 00:14:00,530
side control us, give knowledge and on the
other side they give us the knowledge about

106
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:03,790
others. These centers are within us.

107
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:10,480
Now when I’m telling you all this you have
to have an open mind of a scientist. We shouldn’t

108
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,490
just deny it because in your concept it doesn’t
fitting. But like a scientist please see to

109
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:23,490
it that if it is proved you have to accept
that this is so. Now these charkas are within

110
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:31,419
you, these centers are within you, and these
centers communicate to you through your fingertips

111
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:38,959
what’s the matter with a child. You can
feel it on your fingertips, now five, six,

112
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:44,299
and seven centers, right side, seven centers.
(Shri Mataji points to the chakra projections

113
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:47,809
on Her left and right palms.) The right side
has got the seven centers, if they are decoded

114
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:51,770
properly and if you know what is the decoding
is, putting the hand towards a child, for

115
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:58,260
a Realized soul it is very easy to see where
is the problem. And as soon as he finds a

116
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:02,600
problem and he knows how to cure it he can
cure people without going to doctors.

117
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:09,260
Sahaja Yoga has cured, I must say, I don’t
want to claim it because I don’t want to

118
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:16,260
open a hospital. We are here to create doctors
and not patients. So even some patients who

119
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:24,370
have come to us have become doctors today
in a way that they diagnose it on their fingertips.

120
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:31,370
As Mohammed Sahib has clearly said that, “At
the time of your resurrection your hands will

121
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:38,240
speak”. But still nobody wants to know about
it, that’s called as a resurrection time,

122
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,579
as [SOUNDS LIKE – Kayama], nobody wants
to talk about it. “Your hands will speak

123
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:48,069
and will give evidence and witness against
you”, clearly He has said it, I must say,

124
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:55,069
He’d done such a lot of work on the Self-knowledge;
as Christ has also said so many things.

125
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:05,230
But people don’t want to look at that side.
Like to say that, “We must suffer” itself

126
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:12,900
is a nonsense, I think, how can you. Any God
who is a compassionate Father would like His

127
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:20,360
children to suffer to meet Him? I mean, it
doesn’t going to logic at all. But people

128
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:28,160
accept this funny concept of sufferings. What
about Christ? He suffered for us, isn’t

129
00:16:28,439 --> 00:16:35,439
it? Isn’t it that He suffered for us? If
so, is has He left something for us to be

130
00:16:36,049 --> 00:16:43,049
done, to be completed more than He has suffered?
He has suffered for us and He has done the

131
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:57,220
job fully. We don’t have to do any more
about it. He carried the cross. People make

132
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:08,919
Him look like a TB patient, even worse than
that, just bones and the skins. It’s very

133
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:16,160
surprising, how can you conceive Christ like
that?! Anyone of the people who say they are

134
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:26,459
very healthy people, let them carry the cross
and we’ll see. It is so contradictory about

135
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:36,030
Christ, there’s surprisingly that He should
say that you have to suffer.

136
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,810
Same about Jews. I just don’t understand
why should they say that you have to suffer

137
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:50,810
if their God is kind? Same about all other
organized; all these organized or perverted

138
00:17:53,050 --> 00:18:00,050
people who say that you have to suffer. Suddenly
people become vegetarians, suddenly they become

139
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,950
fasting. In India though we have to fast in
any case because of lack of food, but they

140
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:11,480
have fasting days. There are some people who
fast at least five days in a week. They fasting.

141
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,860
What is the need to fast? If you ask for fasting
you’ll have to fast all your life. That’s

142
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:21,140
what God gives you, “You fast now, you want
to fast? All right, have it fasting.” We

143
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:28,140
are asking for trouble. You want to be miserable?
All right, be miserable. You want to be unhappy?

144
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,930
All right, be unhappy.

145
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:37,600
You find people coming out of congregations,
which are supposed to be very religious so

146
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:44,600
miserable looking. How can it be? It has to
be joy, it has to be happiness. Just think

147
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:53,350
of it, how can we ever believe such things
what we have believed for ages, ages, ages,

148
00:18:53,350 --> 00:19:00,350
and it can not go out of our heads, that we
have to suffer. How long, how many years,

149
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:10,140
how many lives? Nothing is written anywhere.
You better go on suffering and make others

150
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:16,640
suffer also with it. If some person is like
that in your family you’d like to run away

151
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,560
with that boredom, because he’s suffering
for nothing at all and (Shri Mataji laughs)

152
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:24,520
he don’t understand why is he suffering.
So you want to run away from such a person.

153
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:31,520
And all this kind of ideas we have accepted
for ages now. And that has led us to a big

154
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,550
confusion about God.

155
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:41,550
Then we take to things which give us joy.
Actually they are not, they are just flippant

156
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,890
pleasures. We can not enjoy anything in life,
really we can not. We can see the way people

157
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:54,850
are now going on for such sensational things.
The reason is there’s no joy. The sensitivity

158
00:19:54,850 --> 00:20:01,850
to joy is so reduced that I sometimes fear
with all that they are doing they so fed up,

159
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:08,810
that they may have to put electrodes in the
limbic area to get the joy instead. They have

160
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:15,810
become so very (Shri Mataji smiles) so very
insensitive to anything, they’ll not laugh,

161
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:25,870
they’ll not smile, they are so full of closed
hearts and frightened things, whatever they

162
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,160
said about humane beings.

163
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:35,160
Now first thing you have to know – you don’t
have to suffer at all. Secondly, you don’t

164
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:43,590
have to judge yourself. Let your Kundalini
rise and judge you. You don’t start judging

165
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,150
yourself and condemning yourself.

166
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:51,150
And the another fashion, which is very common,
is to feel guilty. From the very beginning

167
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:59,330
you start, “I am afraid”. What are you
afraid of? You have to have all the courage,

168
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:08,400
all the blessings, and all the confidence.
You are a humane being and this is the message

169
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:14,390
I want to tell you that you are a humane being
and you have to be the Spirit. And once you

170
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:19,230
are the Spirit you’ll be surprised the blessings
will be showering upon you. In these modern

171
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:24,030
times should talk about these things is out
of date. But it is predicted that this will

172
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:31,030
be said and this will be done. For us it is
important first of all to know our own glory,

173
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:40,600
our own truths, and about how we are built
and how others are built. Once you know that

174
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:47,470
first of all the peace within is established.
Unless and until there is peace within what

175
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:54,470
do you talk of this peace organization and
Peace Nobel Prize? I’ve seen the people

176
00:21:54,650 --> 00:22:01,650
who have gotten Nobel Prizes are the most
hot-headed so much that you have to talk to

177
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:10,790
them with a barge pole in between. Any time
they are up to jump on you, you can not challenge

178
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:16,530
them; even talking to them is a difficult
situation. So how are they going to have this

179
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:21,370
peace foundation when they are themselves
so shaking?

180
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:28,370
Then you have other things talking about – the
love, the love. Full of lust and greed. They

181
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:37,820
love your purse, not you. When you talk of
love, love is a thing that’s detached. Like

182
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:48,590
the sap in the tree rises, goes to all the
leaves, all the trunk, all the flowers, all

183
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:56,330
the fruits and comes back, is not attached.
If it’s get attached to one fruit the tree

184
00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:03,710
will die and the fruit will die too. So this
Pure Love or the Divine Love is detached,

185
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:10,710
that’s why it acts, it works. A person who
is a Realized soul is such a pure personality

186
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:21,280
that even a glance of such a person can do
lots of things. Even a thought of such a person

187
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:28,280
in the attention can do so many things, bring
about so many changes.

188
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:35,860
So this is the time of our transformation.
We have to become a higher personality; the

189
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:46,000
transformation has to take place. At the time
of Easter we give people eggs. Perhaps people

190
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:53,730
do not know why do we give them eggs at the
time of Easter. But about Christ is written

191
00:23:53,730 --> 00:24:00,030
in our Scriptures that He was an egg to begin
with. Of course, He was much more before that,

192
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:07,030
but to begin with He was the God of innocence.
But then He came as an egg. And then He was

193
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:17,200
divided into two halves. The one half, which
incarnated, and which transformed this Earth.

194
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:26,920
So the resurrection is the transformation.
Like an egg, if we are bound by our conditioning

195
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:35,200
and by our ego, we break through that shell
and become a bird, which is really a free

196
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:41,620
bird. Only thing, the bird has to know how
to fly. Now this is, again I’m saying is

197
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:48,620
the living process of the living nature, of
the living Power of Love. It is not something

198
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:57,590
artificial. In Sahaja Yoga, I must have spoken
in this hall I don’t know how many times

199
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:02,830
might before and again today there’s a chance
to speak to you.

200
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:09,490
What I have to say, that it is important the
becoming. Is not important: you can not become

201
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:16,120
a member of Sahaj Yog, you can not pay membership,
you can not pay for your Realization. How

202
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:23,120
can you pay? How much do we pay to the Mother
Earth to sprout the seed, does She understand?

203
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:30,300
Because She has the power She sprouts the
seed. If you give Her money or read something

204
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:39,320
before Her, it makes no difference. But once
you get your Realization you start understanding

205
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:46,320
how many powers you have. And the greatest
power is of compassion and detached love.

206
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:53,740
These seven chakras are within us, which are
to be enlightened by the awakening of the

207
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:59,530
Kundalini about which Dr. Spiro has already
told you. Now in this short time I can not

208
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:05,890
cover up the whole subject. I must have given
at least more than thousand lectures in English

209
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:12,400
language. But I would request you one thing
that forget about what you have learned so

210
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:19,400
far. About your conditionings because if you
had achieved anything out of that I was not

211
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:28,910
necessary. Now you have to see with a clean
slate, as they say, what you can achieve in

212
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:35,070
this lifetime, which is the most important
thing, is to be achieved.

213
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:42,070
Of course, where’s a lot of things that
should really make you more tempting about

214
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:51,420
it. Firstly, that you get rid of all your
illnesses. Most of the illnesses can be cured

215
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:58,420
– if they are at an early stage – by Sahaja
Yoga. Most of the mental illnesses can be

216
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:06,510
cured with Sahaja Yoga. Your material problems
can be solved by Sahaja Yoga. Your spiritual

217
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:14,010
problems like going to wrong gurus and wrong
people whatever you have accumulated within

218
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:21,010
you can be corrected. But the highest of all
that you become sensitive to joy. Then you

219
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:28,900
start seeing joy in everything. You don’t
have to think that, “Oh, this is the thing

220
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:35,900
which is marvelous”. No. It just happens,
you see it is. Just you enjoy without thinking

221
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,370
about it.

222
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:45,160
You become a peaceful personality. You become
a dynamic personality. Your are not spade

223
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:51,230
by other veils of things, like some fashion
coming up, then some sort of a nonsensical

224
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:56,720
idea coming up, then some medicine coming
up and you treating yourself and getting to

225
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,590
trouble. You just rise above all the these
things at a higher level and you start see

226
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:08,240
everything as a witness. You become the witness
of all the jokes that are going on and you

227
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:15,240
just watch it and you think, “What’s all
this? Is just a play”. Many people have

228
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:21,240
said that, “Mother, You always laugh so
much and You have always smiling face, so

229
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:26,690
the people are not going to take You seriously”.
I said, “I don’t want them to be serious”.

230
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:32,130
There’s not going to be any seriousness
needed. What are you serious about? You should

231
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:38,300
be happy. It’s fun. We have to be happy
people. We have to be happy. Most people who

232
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:44,080
think, they are very guilty, should punish
themselves by saying, “You are not guilty,

233
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:49,840
you are not guilty” 108 times. That’s
what we have in Sahaja Yoga. Is just the myth.

234
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:55,760
All these are myths; we are working with myths
and making our lives miserable, which is meant

235
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:02,760
to be joy, happiness and all the overflowing
blessings of the Divine.

236
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:10,440
Whatever I’m telling you about we have within
ourselves all the great powers hidden of our

237
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:18,550
brain, of our liver, of our heart, – they
are to be enlightened. And then in the light

238
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,500
you see everything. But as in this room you
have so many lights you have to just push

239
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:29,630
in one button and the whole thing comes out.
In the same way it happens. But if I start

240
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:35,450
telling you about the history of electricity
in the dark and all about how it came here

241
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:41,910
and what all happened, you’d be just fed
up with it. So what we are doing is to tell

242
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:47,070
you that let us put on the button first, you
better have your light and see in that light

243
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:54,070
if it is true or not. If it is true you have
to understand and accept it honestly. You

244
00:29:54,940 --> 00:30:00,260
have to be honest to yourself that is the
main point I’m trying to tell you. We are

245
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:05,080
not to play about with ourselves and play
about with our conditionings. We have to be

246
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:11,330
honest and to get to our properties that are
within our selves. I’m not here to oblige

247
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:16,880
you at all, there’s no obligation. Is just
like a catalyst, I would say, and you become

248
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,740
the catalyst oneself once you get your Realization.
And you can do all that I can do, it’s very

249
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:26,070
easy and very simple.

250
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:30,179
May God bless you all.

251
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:30,440
(Aside) Now, should we have questions or what?

252
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:30,980
I find most of you were just ready for getting
Self-Realization. Not only that, but I think

253
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:37,980
you all capable of that. But still there must
be some people who must be want to ask questions.

254
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:28,100
I would only request – don’t be aggressive
with Me, there’s no need. I’ve not come

255
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:35,100
here for votes, nor for any money, nor for
anything. I’ve just come here to give you

256
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:44,190
your own keys. Out of Love that I am. So please
try to understand Me. I’m not here to take,

257
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:55,240
I mean, anything from you. Just to show you
what you are and you’ll be happy to know

258
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,760
that you are something great.

259
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:04,760
So may God bless you, I would like you to
ask Me questions related to Self-Realization

260
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:10,700
and not to waste the time of so many who look
so anxious to have their Self-Realization.

261
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:17,700
Those who do not want to do any meditation
after this, which will take hardly ten minutes

262
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:23,559
for you to get your Realization, because the
journey is three to four feet only – from

263
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:27,610
here to here. (Shri Mataji shows the distance
from Mooladhar to Sahasrara Chakra with Her

264
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:28,440
hand.) That’s all.

265
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:34,950
So, I would just say, that you will all get
your Realization in no time. Should get your

266
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:40,870
Realization, but do not try to be uncivil.
If you do not want to have it, you should

267
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:46,330
leave the hall and leave others in peace.
That would be very kind of us. And not to

268
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:52,420
see and watch, we don’t need such people
here. Those who want to have Realization can

269
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:58,200
sit down or others have freedom to go, but
not freedom to sit here. So I would request

270
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:05,200
you to be kind and civil to others who want
to receive their Realization.

271
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:11,390
Any questions, please.

272
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:15,860
Q.: [NOT AUDIBLE]

273
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,850
What’s it?

274
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:25,850
A Sahaja Yogi: Mother, he said that Dr. Spiro
couldn’t complete his talk about how the

275
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:53,450
germinating principle works. Could You say
something to finish of what he said?

276
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,309
Shri Mataji: Generating principle?

277
00:33:56,309 --> 00:33:57,380
The Sahaja Yogi: Germinating.

278
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:02,220
Shri Mataji: You see, it is, I would say,
it is spontaneous. Now that should explain

279
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:09,220
a little bit how does a seed germinate. You
have the seed and you put it in the Mother

280
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:20,569
Earth, all right? And it germinates because
it’s all built in it, this is all built

281
00:34:20,569 --> 00:34:27,569
in it, all this is built in it. And in the
triangular bone you have got this Kundalini,

282
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:33,010
which is placed within you in 3,5 coils of
an energy, which is a residual energy. Which

283
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:40,010
is actually the power of your pure desire.
Because the desire that we have otherwise,

284
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:51,159
all the desires, are not pure. What’s why
they are not satiable in general. We get one

285
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:55,240
thing, we want to have another. We get the
another thing, you want to have the third

286
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:55,659
thing.

287
00:34:55,659 --> 00:35:02,659
So this is the power of pure desire. And this
pure desire is described in the Bible as Holy

288
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:12,210
Ghost, in the Koran as [SOUNDS LIKE – Asas]
and in the Indian Scriptures as Adi Shakti,

289
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:23,560
as the Primordial Mother. So She is the power
of God as called as the Primordial Mother.

290
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:32,880
Now this Primordial Mother is settled in our
triangular bone while the Spirit which is

291
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:40,869
the reflection of God Almighty is in our heart.
But the seat of the heart is on top of your

292
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:49,609
head – here – on the fontanel bone area,
which is called as Brahmarandra in Sanskrit

293
00:35:49,609 --> 00:35:56,609
language. And also when we talk of baptism
we try to bless there, but it’s artificial.

294
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:04,740
Real baptism is when this Kundalini, which
is the Holy Ghost or the Adi Shakti, the reflection

295
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:13,130
of that, rises within you piercing through
these centers, piercing through the fontanel

296
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:20,320
bone area and actualizes the experience of
this personal experience and gives you a cool

297
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,250
breeze coming out of your head. Actually the
cool breeze coming out of your head, you feel

298
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:32,550
it, and then you feel it everywhere, the cool
breeze of the Holy Ghost. And that is the

299
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:39,550
subtle of the subtlest, which is the syntheses
of all the powers, which works everything

300
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:42,470
out.

301
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:49,470
Like you can say, in the sulfur dioxide we
have in the molecule of the sulfur dioxide

302
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:56,710
we find that there is pulsation of the vibrations.
Who does what? We say electromagnetic. But

303
00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:03,990
the electromagnetic is one part of the same
power. So this power we can broadly divide

304
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:10,990
into three things. In the first power what
we call as the power by which we desire. The

305
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:18,280
second power by which we act and the third
power by which we ascend. All the synthesis

306
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:27,570
of all these powers, all these powers are
in this Kundalini which meets the Spirit because

307
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,619
the seat of the Spirit, as they call the Pitha,
is on top of your head and that’s how the

308
00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:44,420
whole attention you can see like a sari it
is supposing the attention is spread here

309
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:48,630
and the Kundalini rises, rises like that (Shri
Mataji puts Her finger under the sari on Her

310
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,760
chest and erects it like a tent pole), pierces
through this at and the whole of this attention

311
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:56,600
becomes enlightened. That’s how your attention
becomes enlightened. This is in short I’m

312
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:03,260
telling you. But as I told you we have got
My lectures on all detailed way how it works

313
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:07,670
out, it’s quite a detailed thing. But in
the first lecture it will be quite boring

314
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:12,700
for you. So I think I better tell you this
much, that it’s a spontaneous happening

315
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:19,700
and can happen to all of you.

316
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:43,590
Q. [NOT AUDIBLE]

317
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:54,260
The Sahaja Yogi: Do the first stages in Sahaja
Yoga consist of meditation and how they beneficial

318
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:54,510
physiological changes?

319
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:58,270
Shri Mataji: No, it is, you see, we do not
understand the meaning of meditation actually.

320
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:04,859
You are not to meditate, but you are in meditation
in Sahaja Yoga. You become meditative by temperament.

321
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:10,280
Now, I would suggest like this that in the
beginning why I said you have to meditate,

322
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,950
because I would like to tell you actually
that word is not so suitable, but I said that

323
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:21,950
you have to little bit cooperate with Me how
to help your Kundalini to rise. That’s the

324
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:28,950
process we are going to have in a very simple
words. But I said meditate because that’s

325
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:35,359
all could make the smaller way of saying things.
But actually in Sahaja Yoga the practice of

326
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:42,030
Sahaja Yoga is very different from any kind
of meditation, of concentration or anything.

327
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:48,270
There are very simple ways by which you have
to correct your left or right side and to

328
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:54,040
be in the center. And then when you are in
the center the growth take place. Is very

329
00:39:54,040 --> 00:40:00,390
simple and luckily we are going to have next
Thursday a very good workshop where they will

330
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:05,310
tell you all the details how it has to be
done. And they’ll solve all your questions

331
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:11,450
and all your problems there. And lots of people
are going to be in that place where you’ll

332
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:18,450
find solutions to all these questions you
ask. Thursday they are going to have a very

333
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:41,510
good workshop.

334
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:47,280
Q. [NOT AUDIBLE]

335
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:54,280
Shri Mataji: [YES or FIRST], sickness can
be cured if you become Self-Realized. Actually

336
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:07,369
you don’t go to doctors then anymore, you
become a doctor yourself. So the physical

337
00:41:07,369 --> 00:41:11,790
sufferings can be, this [NOT AUDIBLE – way
?]. Now the collective suffering comes by

338
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:18,260
the stupidity of humane beings, by the ego
of humane beings, of wrong ideas, you see.

339
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:24,320
Like a Hindu fighting a Sikh and a Muslim
fighting a Muslim and a Christian fighting

340
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:31,320
the Jews or all the sorts of nonsense. And
also the capitalist fighting the communists.

341
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:37,369
Actually I should say I’m a capitalist because
I have certain powers and I’m the greatest

342
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:42,290
communist because I must distribute it. This
is the real power which has to be distributed.

343
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:46,590
What is the money power to be distributed?
– Useless thing. Money doesn’t give you

344
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:52,630
any sense. So is the combination of everything,
the synthesis of everything you’ll find

345
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:59,630
and that’s how you are surprised that the
sufferings just disappear. Also now you might

346
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:07,940
say that, “What about the sufferings of
the nature?” People who are Realized souls

347
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:15,790
never get those suffering things because you
see this full cosmos is within them, they

348
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:22,830
are looked after. This is at a humane awareness.
But at the spiritual awareness you become

349
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:31,770
beyond sufferings. And Christ is to be awakened
within you, that’s the points is. Because

350
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:38,020
Christ is not awakened within you. When the
Christ, you know, in this chakra – this

351
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:45,020
center is Agya chakra, here – is bestowed
the Deity of Christ. Now here if you can see

352
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:52,190
in the map there is they have shown on one
side the ego, another side – the superego,

353
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:59,190
means the conditioning. Now when this chakra
is awakened meaning the Christ within us is

354
00:43:00,849 --> 00:43:07,849
awakened, then He sucks in our karmas. That’s
why they say that He died for our sins. Then

355
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:16,230
He also sucks in our conditioning, both the
things. He is placed in the middle of the

356
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:28,190
brain you can say where is the optic chaisma
crossing and He looks after the pituitary

357
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:36,410
and the pineal body. That’s how He controls
both the things within us and He sucks in.

358
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:40,030
And when He sucks in there’s an opening
that takes place on our fontanel bone area

359
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:41,240
and through that then the Kundalini pierces
through.

360
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,270
Q. [NOT AUDIBLE]

361
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:49,270
The Sahaja Yogi: How can you keep your Self-Realization
if you are not in touch with the collective?

362
00:43:53,300 --> 00:44:00,300
Shri Mataji: You can not. You have to keep
some connection with the collective. It’s

363
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:17,930
like say nowadays it’s autumn you have seen.
In autumn what happens? A bark like a cork

364
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:24,930
develops between the leaves and the tree.
And such a leaf falls off and dies. You have

365
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:31,260
to be in the collective, you can not keep
your Self-Realization without collectivity.

366
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:37,890
Is very important to be with the collective.
This is one point people fail, because they

367
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:42,900
think they’ll lose their individuality.
Is a wrong idea. Actually when the leaf dies

368
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:48,020
it has no individuality. On the contrary,
when it is on the tree you’ll be surprised,

369
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:55,020
that one leaf can not tally with another leaf
in the whole world. Such an individual thing

370
00:44:56,510 --> 00:45:03,510
it is. It is I would say unity in diversity,
complete unity in diversity. Because that

371
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:10,690
is the variety is the one that gives beauty
to this world. Otherwise if we are all sort

372
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:15,540
of dressed of the same way, walking the same
way, it will be such a boring company.

373
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:22,540
Is there any question? Such a rapport. It’s
beautiful people today. All right.

374
00:45:31,869 --> 00:45:38,869
So now, as I’ve requested you, those who
would like to go, should go. Because when

375
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:48,050
we do this we all have to close the eyes and
people are not even willing to do that. So

376
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:54,330
the thing is that the Divine is not going
to fall at out feet, isn’t it? We have to

377
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:59,930
be little humble about it. If we don’t have
that humility is better we should try other

378
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:06,930
methods and then come to Sahaja Yoga. Because
Sahaja Yoga is not meant for arrogant people,

379
00:46:08,609 --> 00:46:13,450
for people who think knowing of themselves.
Is meant for people who want to get their

380
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:20,450
Self-Realization.

381
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:30,840
Now a simple thing we have to do, all of us,
which is also sometimes not liked by people

382
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:37,460
when I tell them – we have to take out our
shoes. Because this Mother Earth is going

383
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:43,310
to help us a lot. She’s the one who is giver
of everything. So we have to take out our

384
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:50,310
shoes and touch the Mother Earth. You can
keep your socks on with your both the feet.

385
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:06,390
Put both the feet separately because there
are two powers separately on the Mother Earth.

386
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:39,070
Those who are sitting on the ground are all
right as they are, they need not put their

387
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:46,070
feet like this, they can sit in a Sahaja asana,
means in a way that is relaxed, not to put

388
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:54,349
legs on top of another row or anything. Any
stress on your body is not needed. You have

389
00:47:54,349 --> 00:48:01,349
to be comfortable to be straight, sitting
straight, not putting your neck back or forward,

390
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:09,839
just sitting straight, that’s all.

391
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:16,839
One promise has to be there in your heart,
that you will after Realization respect your

392
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:24,320
Realization and grow like a tree and should
not be the like the parable of the seeds that

393
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:33,030
some seeds fell on a rock and some who sprouted
also got lost. I would request you very-very

394
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:41,310
earnestly and with a great concern that you
have to look after your Self-Realization and

395
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:49,839
your growth. As we do not take any money from
anyone, we don’t have very elaborate places

396
00:48:51,099 --> 00:48:58,099
or elaborate centers, so whatever is available
is there for you. But that is God’s place

397
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:07,080
and you have to come there to get all the
information, the knowledge about the Self.

398
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:16,400
I hope you will not treat it with just a side
issue, but the main object of your humane

399
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:29,250
assent. You don’t have to pay for it; you
don’t have to do anything else. Moreover,

400
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:38,920
we are all the time trying to save time and
that is why the time has to be spent is been

401
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,839
collective and enjoying the joy.

402
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:51,190
May God bless you all.

403
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:57,000
So both hands have to be like this, to begin
with. This is because as I told you these

404
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:03,500
are all sympathetic centers which are to be
enlightened first of all, so the information

405
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:09,430
goes to the Kundalini that the Kundalini is
to be awakened. This is first thing we have

406
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:10,810
to do.

407
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:17,810
Now, secondly, we have to facilitate the movement
of the Kundalini even if she’s awakened.

408
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:26,740
And for that I will tell you how to put your
hand into various centers to the various centers

409
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:35,200
so that you can yourself facilitate. I would
like one of you to get up and show this better.

410
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:37,690
Yeah.

411
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:44,690
Now Dr. Spiro will show you also and I will
also that first you have to put your hand

412
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:50,980
to your heart where resides. Now left hand
towards Me and right hand on the heart. Left

413
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:57,980
hand towards Me. Now to your heart and here
resides the Spirit. We work only on the left

414
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:07,369
hand side, because that is the side of our
desire and put the left hand like this symbolically

415
00:51:07,369 --> 00:51:14,369
meaning that this is the power of desire and
we want to have our Self-Realization, expression

416
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,339
of that.

417
00:51:17,339 --> 00:51:24,339
Now the second chakra is on the upper part
of your abdomen on the left hand side. This

418
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:34,460
is the center of your mastery by which the
mastery over this power of love or Divine

419
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:45,250
vibrations you achieve and manifest through
your being. Is just starts working like through

420
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:52,250
our eyes we can see the light. In the same
way, once you become the master, you can feel,

421
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:58,940
you can know everything about yourself and
about others.

422
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:05,940
Then you have to take down your right hand
to the lower part of your abdomen. This is

423
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:16,220
the one, which is working out our pure knowledge,
knowledge, which is absolute and pure. This

424
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:28,460
center is very important and by some unauthorized
people if some people have tamper it we have

425
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:33,500
to nourish it by putting our right hand towards
it.

426
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:40,500
Then again we go back into the upper part
of the abdomen.

427
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,750
Then we go back to our heart.

428
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:50,750
Now here we go back to the left hand side
of our neck, here, like this from front. Many

429
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,369
people tried this side (Shri Mataji pointed
to the back side of Her neck). No. You have

430
00:52:57,369 --> 00:53:04,369
to try from front and then turn your head
to your right, like this. Now this center

431
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:12,000
catches when we feel guilty and now I find
quite a lot catching in this audience. So

432
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:21,210
please for the sake of your Self-Realization
forgive yourself, forgive yourself, forgive

433
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:22,200
yourself.

434
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:29,200
Now, please now stretch your hand like this
and put it on top of your forehead. This is

435
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:38,070
the center of forgiveness, – here. And press
it on both the sides, like this.

436
00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:45,070
Now you have to take this hand on the back,
rest your head on that, put the head up. And

437
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:53,910
then you have to take out your hand again
and stretch it like this. Fully stretched.

438
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:05,849
The center of your palm is to be placed on
top of the fontanel bone area. You might bend

439
00:54:05,849 --> 00:54:12,849
your head a little, would be better. Just
there, which was a soft bone in your childhood,

440
00:54:13,089 --> 00:54:20,089
and you have to press your scalp and move
it about seven times slowly in a clockwise

441
00:54:23,349 --> 00:54:23,710
manner.

442
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:30,710
That’s all we have to do. But we must press
it hard and the fingers must be pushed back

443
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:46,800
nicely so that we can press our palm nicely.
All right. That’s all is to be done. [INAUDIBLE

444
00:54:50,089 --> 00:54:52,450
WORD – Principally ?]

445
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:58,650
Now we have to close our eyes. Please don’t
open your eyes till I’ll tell you. Because

446
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:05,650
the attention will be attracted inside and
please you can take out your glasses. The

447
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:12,109
other day one lady who was quite blind I think
and she started seeing this, I mean, you know,

448
00:55:12,109 --> 00:55:19,109
things happen like that. I would request you
to take out your glasses. It helps you. And

449
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:26,599
you keep your eyes shut till I’ll tell you,
please don’t open your eyes. It is how you

450
00:55:26,599 --> 00:55:33,599
are going to help yourself and also you will
know how to all the time raise your Kundalini.

451
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:42,690
It’s very simple method, which I’m telling
you.

452
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:49,930
Now, please put your left hand towards Me
like this and right hand on your heart. Left

453
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:57,460
hand towards Me and right hand on your heart.
Here, now close your eyes. In the heart resides

454
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:06,750
the Spirit. So please ask Me question within
yourself, a very fundamental question, you

455
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:13,750
can call Me Shri Mataji or Mother, whatever
you like, “Mother, am I the Spirit?” Ask

456
00:56:15,579 --> 00:56:22,579
this question, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”
Is a very fundamental question here to ask.

457
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:32,619
Ask this question three times.

458
00:56:32,619 --> 00:56:39,619
Now, if you are the Spirit, you are also your
guide and master. Please put your right hand

459
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:50,240
in the upper part of your abdomen on the left
hand side, on your stomach on the left hand

460
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:57,240
side and press it hard and ask a question
here three times again, “Mother, am I my

461
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:07,410
own master? Mother, am I my own master? Mother,
am I my own master?” Ask this question in

462
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:16,329
your heart.

463
00:57:16,329 --> 00:57:23,329
Now, we move our right hand, move it down
into the lower part of your abdomen on the

464
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:39,490
left hand side. Now here, please keep your
eyes shut, please keep your eyes shut and

465
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:46,490
don’t move too much. Here you have to know
that I respect your freedom and I can not

466
00:57:48,619 --> 00:57:55,619
force you to have the pure knowledge. You
have to say that you want it. So here you

467
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:08,690
please say, “Mother, please give me pure
knowledge” six times, because this center

468
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:20,390
has got six petals. So please say six times,
“Mother, please give me pure knowledge”.

469
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:33,900
With this asking the Kundalini starts rising,
because she knows you want it. Now to facilitate

470
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:45,400
her movement we go back to the higher chakra
and take our hand to the upper part of the

471
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:54,079
abdomen on the left hand side and press it
hard. Now, with full confidence we have to

472
00:58:54,079 --> 00:59:01,079
say ten times, “Mother, I am my own master”.
Say it with full confidence so the Kundalini

473
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:11,410
will rise, “Mother, I am my own master”.
Please say it ten times. This will correct

474
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:25,450
your spiritual domination if somebody has
dominated you spiritually in the sense that

475
00:59:26,839 --> 00:59:33,839
they have misguided you spiritually. “I
am my own master”.

476
00:59:34,369 --> 00:59:41,369
Now, raise your right hand to the heart. Here
resides the Spirit. So with full confidence

477
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:09,490
say twelve times, “Mother, I am the Spirit”.
Have confidence in yourself.

478
01:00:15,589 --> 01:00:22,589
We have to know, that the Divine is the ocean
of love and compassion. But above all it is

479
01:00:27,329 --> 01:00:34,329
the ocean of forgiveness and we can not commit
any mistakes, which the Divine can not forgive.

480
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:45,310
So please forgive yourself, forgive yourself
fully, and raise your right hand in the corner

481
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:58,470
of your neck and your shoulder, and turn your
head to the right. And here with full confidence

482
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:06,720
you say sixteen times, “Mother, I am not
guilty at all”. Please say it, very important

483
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:16,270
and as I said, if you still feel guilty, you
can punish yourself by saying it hundred and

484
01:01:17,619 --> 01:01:23,960
eight times. You have to be pleasantly placed
towards yourself because you are going to

485
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:30,960
enter into the Kingdom of God. You have to
love yourself and respect yourself. Sixteen

486
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:53,280
times please say it.

487
01:02:03,589 --> 01:02:10,589
Now raise your hand and put it on your forehead
across. Put it on your forehead across. This

488
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:24,650
is the center of forgiveness. So please here
you have to say, “Mother, I forgive everyone”,

489
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:41,480
from your heart. You might say it is difficult,
but it is a myth. Whether you forgive or you

490
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:48,460
do not forgive you do not do anything. But
if you do not forgive then you play into wrong

491
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:55,460
hands. So to get over all the loads you just
say from your heart, “Mother, I forgive

492
01:02:55,609 --> 01:03:02,609
everyone”. It’s not important how many
times. Press it on both the sides please.

493
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:13,690
Now take back your hand, and put your hand
on the back of your head, and raise your head

494
01:03:23,130 --> 01:03:30,130
on that. Move your head upward. Now here for
your own satisfaction only, without counting

495
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:40,560
any mistakes or guilt you can say, “Oh,
Divine, if I have made any mistakes, please

496
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:50,130
forgive me”. For your own satisfaction,
don’t feel guilty about it. In a very pleasant

497
01:03:57,329 --> 01:03:58,410
manner.

498
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:05,410
Now stretch your hand fully, push back your
fingers, and put the center of your palm on

499
01:04:13,369 --> 01:04:20,369
top of the fontanel bone area, and now start
moving it very slowly, very slowly clockwise

500
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:30,690
the scalp. Press it hard, push back your fingers.
Seven times. At this point I must say that

501
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:38,060
I can not force again the Self-Realization
upon you. I respect your freedom. You have

502
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:44,369
to ask for it. So please say seven times,
“Mother, please give me my Realization,

503
01:04:44,369 --> 01:04:48,240
give me my Self-Realization”. Or, “May
I have my Self-Realization”. (Shri Mataji

504
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:55,240
is blowing in the microphone 7 times.)

505
01:05:55,130 --> 01:06:02,130
Now please take down your hands. Please open
your eyes very slowly. Now watch Me without

506
01:06:11,089 --> 01:06:18,089
thinking. Let’s see if you can do it. Without
thinking. Just watch Me without thinking.

507
01:06:20,589 --> 01:06:27,589
Please put your right hand towards Me, right
hand towards Me like this. And the left hand

508
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:36,460
above your head and bend your head and try
to see if you are feeling any cool breeze

509
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:43,920
from here. Bend your head, bend, bend it.
Little higher. Some people get it very high,

510
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:56,790
very high they get it, some of them. Move
it. And now put the left hand towards Me like

511
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:10,790
this, again bend your head and see if you
are getting a cool breeze in your head.

512
01:07:19,849 --> 01:07:26,849
Now put your right hand towards Me again,
bend your head and see for yourself again

513
01:07:28,819 --> 01:07:35,819
if there’s a cool breeze.

514
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:43,319
Now raise both your hands towards the sky
and push back your head and ask a question

515
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:58,220
three times, “Mother, is this the cool breeze
of the Holy Ghost? Mother, is this the Brahma

516
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:05,720
Shakti? Mother, is this the All Pervading
Power of God’s Love?” Just ask the question.

517
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:19,800
Now put down your hands. Now please put your
hands like this. You’ll feel very relaxed

518
01:08:27,630 --> 01:08:34,029
and peaceful. In the hands also you’ll feel
little cool breeze coming. Some people might

519
01:08:34,029 --> 01:08:41,029
feel in one hand, might feel in another hand.
Some of them do feel that way.

520
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:50,369
All those who are feeling the cool breeze
on top of their heads or on their fingertips,

521
01:09:00,429 --> 01:09:07,429
please raise both your hands. Both hands to
be raised those who are feeling it. Just imagine!

522
01:09:18,309 --> 01:09:25,309
Most of them have felt it. Imagine. Hardly
very few haven’t felt. It’s very easy

523
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:33,319
for them also to feel it and if they want
they can come up to the stage and people can

524
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:41,380
look after them. They can feel it today, they
should and they will work out their Kundalini.

525
01:09:42,659 --> 01:09:49,659
Maybe little help is needed and it’s very
kind of you, all of you to have received your

526
01:09:51,929 --> 01:09:58,929
Realization. I bow to all of you. I bow to
all of you and I beg of you as a Mother that

527
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:05,739
please look after your Self-Realization, do
not waste it. Those who haven’t got it should

528
01:10:05,739 --> 01:10:12,739
not feel in any way disturbed or upset, it’s
very simple. Maybe the little time was needed

529
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:20,650
more or whatever it is. I would request them
to come on the stage for five minutes or ten

530
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:25,010
minutes and they might get their Realization
very well.

531
01:10:25,010 --> 01:10:27,280
May God bless you.

532
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:34,280
Also if you want to come and meet Me you can
come on the stage, I would like to talk to

533
01:10:44,829 --> 01:10:51,829
you. So many! Now what do you want? The England,
the whole England! Those who want to be should

534
01:10:53,219 --> 01:10:55,980
come, one by one, please.
