00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:38.767
Today we have all gathered here for
worshipping your Guru.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:48.230
As you know that the principle of Guru
resides in the Void.

00:00:51.948 --> 00:00:56.546
This is the principle which gives you
balance,

00:00:58.771 --> 00:01:04.358
which gives you the gravity.

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:13.765
The gravity that we have in the Mother
Earth

00:01:16.614 --> 00:01:24.161
is expressed through your Guru principle.

00:01:27.682 --> 00:01:33.485
The first point of gravity is

00:01:34.505 --> 00:01:44.633
that you should have a personality,
a character and a temperament

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:59.461
that people would see that you are
a personality

00:01:59.662 --> 00:02:06.685
who doesn’t get dissolved into worldly
things.

00:02:06.886 --> 00:02:21.065
Is a personality which doesn’t get ruined
by the skirmishes of life.

00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:32.364
Is the personality of a Guru which sits
down deep into his -

00:02:35.524 --> 00:02:51.517
into his being and is not easily disturbed
or dissolved by

00:02:58.126 --> 00:03:10.114
any solvent what-so-ever. This is the first
principle of the Guru, is the gravity.

00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:16.567
As I told you, it is something which cannot
be dissolved into anything.

00:03:16.768 --> 00:03:22.472
It settles very deep down into your
personality.

00:03:22.673 --> 00:03:27.089
So it doesn’t float in the water.

00:03:28.272 --> 00:03:35.398
Now you see, in the countries which are
developed very much

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:48.798
we think that we have a very great power
of individual attainment.

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:58.628
That individually we are absolutely free,
we can do whatever we like

00:03:58.962 --> 00:04:05.896
and that’s why individual freedom becomes
the goal of all democratic countries,

00:04:06.097 --> 00:04:12.752
neglecting the collective. Of course,
individual is important,

00:04:12.953 --> 00:04:17.344
and it has to become all right to nourish
the collective.

00:04:17.545 --> 00:04:24.026
But if the individual does not have
the gravity,

00:04:24.227 --> 00:04:34.378
then they float on the surface and anything
can impress them.

00:04:34.579 --> 00:04:40.583
That’s why we find today people get
impressed by fashions.

00:04:40.784 --> 00:04:51.302
By fashions, which by no logical reason are
good for your health, for your wisdom.

00:04:51.503 --> 00:04:53.799
[To somebody, "Sit down".]

00:04:54.356 --> 00:05:04.831
No fashion is good for your health, nor for
your development as a personality.

00:05:05.032 --> 00:05:11.010
Sometimes you look so odd with it,
so funny, so stupid.

00:05:11.211 --> 00:05:16.099
Then this, ask your question, “What’s
wrong in becoming stupid?

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.454
What’s wrong in becoming foolish?”

00:05:22.478 --> 00:05:28.778
The reason is, you have an individual
freedom, but your personality has not grown.

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.978
You personality is zero. You have no
personality left.

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:35.638
You cannot decide anything for yourself.

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:39.833
Whatever is the fashion you just run after
that.

00:05:40.034 --> 00:05:49.113
Is this situation of the Western countries,
but in the countries like India now

00:05:49.314 --> 00:05:54.302
there are also in some sort of a craze.

00:05:54.524 --> 00:06:02.596
Because they have to still pass through
this so-called affluence that you have.

00:06:02.797 --> 00:06:05.672
So they'll take to the crazes, like
supposing

00:06:05.873 --> 00:06:09.006
somebody sees a very beautiful carpet with
someone,

00:06:09.207 --> 00:06:12.090
then all rush to buy that carpet.

00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:16.959
They’ll do anything for getting things
to themselves.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.996
So they turn towards materialism also
in the same way

00:06:21.197 --> 00:06:25.408
as you people turn to fashions.

00:06:26.397 --> 00:06:34.602
The individuality is all right up to
a point, but then it becomes a madness.

00:06:34.803 --> 00:06:41.917
Especially in the west the personality is
so low, is so missing

00:06:42.118 --> 00:06:49.772
that any entrepreneur can develop any
craze, any name

00:06:49.973 --> 00:06:53.326
and everybody runs after that and is
impressed.

00:06:53.527 --> 00:06:57.935
Like a stupid fellow can call himself by
some name,

00:06:58.136 --> 00:07:05.337
say, he can call his… by some funny name -
now, say "Poison", as he says.

00:07:05.538 --> 00:07:10.124
Now to everyone to buy "Poison" is a very
great thing.

00:07:10.325 --> 00:07:16.139
Because it is by some stupid man who has
taken a name and so everybody must buy that.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.200
It is nothing special about it. It is
nothing special,

00:07:20.401 --> 00:07:29.765
it is nothing – remarkable. It is nothing
that will make you something great.

00:07:29.966 --> 00:07:34.577
But people will buy that particular make,
because it has a brand

00:07:34.778 --> 00:07:40.298
which everybody will accept. “Oh!
It’s from that particular brand.”

00:07:41.337 --> 00:07:44.780
And it’s such a madness about it.

00:07:44.981 --> 00:07:49.704
Then comes to the anything from hair style,
up to your foot style,

00:07:49.905 --> 00:07:54.199
to your neck style, to your nail style,
to your eyebrow style.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:59.321
I mean, anything, any stupid thing that you
could do to your body is available

00:07:59.522 --> 00:08:04.571
and people take to it because they have
no gravity in them.

00:08:05.887 --> 00:08:12.409
The persons who have gravity do not take
to such changes.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.948
First logically, they’ll try to know if
this change is good or not.

00:08:17.149 --> 00:08:20.455
But only because it’s a change, it's
a craze,

00:08:20.656 --> 00:08:24.800
it's a fashion, they do not take to it.

00:08:27.023 --> 00:08:31.120
This is one of the signs of gravity in
a person

00:08:31.321 --> 00:08:39.189
that he doesn’t float on the ground like
straws.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:46.403
But it stays, it stays like a beautiful
pearl

00:08:46.604 --> 00:08:52.477
in the deep shores of understanding.

00:08:53.672 --> 00:08:58.621
So those who are today here to worship
the Guru,

00:08:58.822 --> 00:09:01.919
they have to worship their own Guru within
themselves

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:06.212
and have to understand that first thing
and foremost thing is

00:09:06.413 --> 00:09:10.793
that we must have gravity in temperament.

00:09:11.182 --> 00:09:15.820
You do not need education for that,
university education.

00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:21.514
You need not read books, you need not
do anything.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:29.304
Only thing is that you have to have your
value system corrected.

00:09:29.799 --> 00:09:34.485
When your value system is corrected, you
understand

00:09:34.686 --> 00:09:41.702
what is good for the society, what is good
for you.

00:09:41.903 --> 00:09:49.189
For example, if it’s a lotus flower, it
will never emit filth and dirt.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:55.401
The fragrance will be always there; if it
is a rose or any other fragrant thing,

00:09:55.602 --> 00:10:00.270
it will emit fragrance only.

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:05.123
It cannot emit something that is filthy.

00:10:05.324 --> 00:10:10.184
Now those who think they are Gurus and have
achieved that gravity

00:10:10.385 --> 00:10:18.764
will never write something which is ugly,
say something which is dirty,

00:10:18.965 --> 00:10:29.987
will never use their mind to appreciate
anything that is filthy and wrong.

00:10:32.509 --> 00:10:37.667
This is the second sign of your value
system.

00:10:37.868 --> 00:10:45.721
In your value system you have to first
of all understand what is auspiciousness,

00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:50.578
what is Divine beauty,

00:10:51.856 --> 00:10:57.325
and what is morality of the Spirit.

00:10:57.658 --> 00:11:04.422
These three things are to be realized and
are to be part and parcel of your being

00:11:04.623 --> 00:11:11.537
so that when people see you, they should
say, “Here is a person we can see

00:11:11.738 --> 00:11:19.393
who has that gravity, here is the person
who has that beauty.”

00:11:19.797 --> 00:11:23.319
It acts inside, outside.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:29.646
A person who has that sobriety inside
dresses up in a sober way.

00:11:29.847 --> 00:11:37.112
He doesn’t dress up to impress others, or
just to show off or to hide something

00:11:37.313 --> 00:11:44.269
or to expose something. But just to respect
his body, he dresses up.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:49.199
When he talks to others, he talks wisdom.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:54.621
He doesn’t talk frivolous things, useless
things

00:11:54.822 --> 00:12:03.439
and things which are of very baser level.

00:12:04.317 --> 00:12:17.386
In his own enterprises, I would say, he has
a kind of a decency and a decorum.

00:12:17.587 --> 00:12:23.512
Like a person tries to become an expert.

00:12:23.713 --> 00:12:33.038
A person who worships his Guru, tries to be
an expert in his work,

00:12:33.239 --> 00:12:38.651
like supposing, there is a person who is
an engineer.

00:12:38.865 --> 00:12:43.727
He doesn’t care for money, he doesn’t care
for fame,

00:12:43.928 --> 00:12:48.049
he doesn’t care for applauses
from others.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:55.295
What he cares is, does he really understand
his subject matter. It won’t be mediocrisy.

00:12:55.496 --> 00:13:02.927
Musician has to be perfectly a musician.
Artist has to be a perfect artist.

00:13:03.128 --> 00:13:09.192
He does not use the general methods
of expertise,

00:13:09.393 --> 00:13:15.528
but his Spirit, the guidance of his Spirit
he tries to improve.

00:13:15.729 --> 00:13:23.039
Like there’s a poet, he tries to improve
his poetry on the level of his Spirit,

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:28.735
but not on the level of money, because
normally people would write things

00:13:28.936 --> 00:13:33.335
just to please the majority of the people,
so they can sell their books

00:13:33.536 --> 00:13:38.296
or something filthy which is not benevolent
to the society,

00:13:38.497 --> 00:13:44.117
nor to the name of the writer, they don’t
mind, they become shameless about it.

00:13:44.318 --> 00:13:51.698
So not that the Guru himself has the value
system, but through his life style,

00:13:51.899 --> 00:13:58.409
through his own preachings, through his
own behavior

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:06.802
he radiates gravity to others – he radiates
gravity to others.

00:14:09.183 --> 00:14:14.867
So it builds up our value system, value
system of a balance.

00:14:15.068 --> 00:14:19.719
But it does not mean that if somebody wants
to become an expert on one subject

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.758
then he neglects the other side.
It’s in balance,

00:14:23.959 --> 00:14:28.659
it has to be in balance, a person say,
for example, who is a musician

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:37.553
and cannot understand a painting – he is
not an artist.

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:42.528
Supposing you are an artist and still you
do not understand Sahaja Yoga,

00:14:42.729 --> 00:14:45.801
then you are not a Yogi.

00:14:46.242 --> 00:14:54.028
So if you start from the central point of
your spirit, you’ll be surprised that

00:14:54.353 --> 00:15:02.677
the knowledge that you receive or whatever
you give is absolutely integrated

00:15:02.878 --> 00:15:06.927
and radiates from one point.

00:15:07.475 --> 00:15:16.704
So, in every way you become an expert, in
any subject you become an expert.

00:15:16.905 --> 00:15:20.996
Anybody asks you a question, you know
everything.

00:15:21.197 --> 00:15:28.287
But in that you know what is worthless and
what is of worth.

00:15:28.488 --> 00:15:35.029
You try to understand what is important.

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:40.388
You know, you give up whatever is worthless
and you would not like to know

00:15:40.589 --> 00:15:46.551
the names of different alcohols. You don’t
want to be expert in that.

00:15:46.752 --> 00:15:52.346
You don’t want to be an expert on knowing
all the names of all the carpet styles.

00:15:52.547 --> 00:15:57.232
You may not like to know all the varieties
of sarees.

00:15:57.433 --> 00:16:00.389
You may not like to know all the names of
all the cameras.

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:06.625
You may know, but need not feel that you
do not.

00:16:07.243 --> 00:16:16.407
But whatever is important for the gravity
of a personality, you will know.

00:16:16.608 --> 00:16:24.229
So if you want to make it simple, we can
know about auspiciousness.

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:31.516
What is auspicious? You’ll know about
fair play.

00:16:31.717 --> 00:16:34.646
What is a fair play towards others.

00:16:34.847 --> 00:16:41.004
You’ll know about what is justice in
the eyes of God.

00:16:41.258 --> 00:16:49.264
You’ll know about the Divine music that
elevates your Kundalini.

00:16:49.465 --> 00:16:56.002
So as a result of this gravity you get
discrimination.

00:16:56.405 --> 00:17:03.012
That you know what is your personality and
what is the water surrounding you.

00:17:03.213 --> 00:17:07.730
You know how to discriminate and this
discrimination

00:17:07.931 --> 00:17:14.782
is also actually innately comes from your
Guru principle.

00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:20.761
But once this Guru principle goes into

00:17:20.962 --> 00:17:27.830
a bizarre state or into some sort of
a turmoil or confusion,

00:17:28.044 --> 00:17:32.821
by so many other things like you have
a wrong guru, you have a false guru,

00:17:33.022 --> 00:17:40.502
you have false ideas, you follow false
doctrines, you follow false theories

00:17:40.703 --> 00:17:49.202
or you follow false books, then this goes
bizarre.

00:17:49.403 --> 00:17:57.805
As a result of that you develop Ekadesha
Rudra on top of your head.

00:17:58.006 --> 00:18:07.384
Also in case, when you have problems

00:18:07.585 --> 00:18:14.293
of not temperant and moderate life, if you
are an extremist,

00:18:14.494 --> 00:18:21.076
if you work too hard or you don’t work
at all or if you only go on

00:18:21.277 --> 00:18:27.028
projecting yourself into one side and not
paying attention

00:18:27.229 --> 00:18:30.496
to the other side of your life,

00:18:30.697 --> 00:18:35.936
with all these imbalances, physical,
mental, emotional and spiritual,

00:18:36.137 --> 00:18:40.511
you develop problems of your Guru
principle, as a result, you develop

00:18:40.712 --> 00:18:46.125
this Ekadesha Rudra, which is the beginning
of your destruction.

00:18:46.326 --> 00:18:50.905
So how important it is to look after your
Guru principle, you can see

00:18:51.106 --> 00:18:57.229
that most of the diseases are caused by
this principle, when neglected

00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:01.432
and ultimately they reach its high – their
heights,

00:19:01.633 --> 00:19:06.324
when it reaches the state of Ekadesha
Rudra.

00:19:06.525 --> 00:19:10.261
Now as realized souls you have crossed
the limit,

00:19:10.462 --> 00:19:18.106
you have come out of your Sahastrara, you
have transcended all those things

00:19:18.479 --> 00:19:24.691
through your Brahma Nadi. But that does not
mean that you have developed that gravity.

00:19:24.892 --> 00:19:31.899
You have now achieved a state.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:42.182
If a flower is there and you put the flower
on the water it will float.

00:19:42.548 --> 00:19:48.950
But when it becomes the fruit and matures,
then you put it in the water,

00:19:49.151 --> 00:19:54.486
it does not float, it goes deep down, it
doesn’t get dissolved.

00:19:54.687 --> 00:20:01.294
It keeps its own identity. That is what is
to be done now

00:20:01.495 --> 00:20:09.686
that you have to become the fruits of
Sahaja Yoga, fruits of Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:09.887 --> 00:20:14.020
Blossom time is over now, you have
to become fruits

00:20:14.295 --> 00:20:21.203
and people who see you should know
that you have no imbalances at all.

00:20:21.404 --> 00:20:29.199
You are the people with special gravity.
So when you talk to people –

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:37.562
when you have any kind of Sahaja Yoga
program,

00:20:37.763 --> 00:20:41.595
you do not behave in a childish manner or
stupid manner.

00:20:41.796 --> 00:20:48.979
I’ve seen people sitting before Me raising
their Kundalini. It’s stupid.

00:20:51.194 --> 00:20:56.869
Or giving bandhan to themselves, is stupid.
So, even coming in the Sahaja Yoga,

00:20:57.070 --> 00:21:04.603
one can have that kind of a stupid behavior
or behavior without gravity.

00:21:04.804 --> 00:21:11.556
Even after coming to Sahaja Yoga, if you
have the same style as you had before,

00:21:11.757 --> 00:21:17.229
then you have to grow, mature, you have
to become still the fruit.

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:27.300
And that is the sign that you become really
the Guru principle people.

00:21:28.772 --> 00:21:38.273
It is important that we have to know
the gravity of the Mother Earth.

00:21:38.474 --> 00:21:43.482
How she revolves with such a tremendous
speed

00:21:43.683 --> 00:21:47.990
holding all of us together to her heart and
then

00:21:48.191 --> 00:21:54.203
she emits her beautiful Divine love through
the various beauties

00:21:54.404 --> 00:21:59.823
that are surrounding us, now we can see
for ourselves.

00:22:00.024 --> 00:22:04.622
Specially when I see the big mountains,

00:22:04.823 --> 00:22:12.400
I feel they are like great saints sitting
and meditating here.

00:22:12.601 --> 00:22:20.026
But they are the only ones who can catch
the Guru principle emitted by the sea.

00:22:20.227 --> 00:22:29.089
As you know the sea is the Guru principle,
and they are so high

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:35.049
that they can catch the Guru principle. So
despite the fact you have that gravity,

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:45.017
you are people of very high standards. And
you are beyond any temptations,

00:22:45.218 --> 00:22:53.850
any stupid ideas or any ideas that can
pervert or spoil others.

00:22:53.850 --> 00:23:01.500
You stand above everybody else, Stalwarts,
as we had very great people on this earth,

00:23:01.701 --> 00:23:06.424
I have given you the names and we said that
there have been ten Gurus,

00:23:06.625 --> 00:23:13.315
starting from Adi Nath, we had Confucius,
we had Socrates

00:23:13.516 --> 00:23:17.399
and later on we had Abraham, Moses and also

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:23.225
up to Shirdi Sai Nath, we had about ten
great Gurus.

00:23:23.426 --> 00:23:27.728
Now we have so many here sitting down, they
are all Gurus

00:23:27.929 --> 00:23:33.391
and they have to behave like Gurus and
they have to do the job of great Gurus.

00:23:33.592 --> 00:23:39.429
And this is what today we have to see if we
can develop that gravity within ourselves

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:48.434
and understanding within ourselves. When
that peace resides within you,

00:23:48.635 --> 00:23:55.642
the joy of becoming Sahaja Yogis will be
really felt,

00:23:55.843 --> 00:24:01.658
will be really understood and will be
enjoyed by all of you.

00:24:01.859 --> 00:24:05.416
May God bless you all!
