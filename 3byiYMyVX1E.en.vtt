20:22.425 --> 20:27.005
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

20:31.245 --> 20:36.025
At the very outset we have to understand

20:37.585 --> 20:45.145
[ASIDE - NOT ALL RIGHT. DO YOU THINK THEY CAN HEAR ME? ITS NOT SO GOOD.]

21:10.985 --> 21:14.105
I'll give You another one Shri Mataji.

21:22.225 --> 21:26.045
Who's responsible for [INAUDIBLE -THIS?]?

21:33.065 --> 21:39.785
Just try [UNCLEAR] I think you have to [INAUDIBLE]

21:47.805 --> 21:50.805
[INAUDIBLE]

22:19.785 --> 22:23.085
[INAUDIBLE] in My hand

23:32.851 --> 23:38.551
One may ask a question - there have been so many saints, prophets, Incarnations

23:39.091 --> 23:46.711
on this earth and whatever they preached, whatever religion they started

23:48.551 --> 23:55.211
people would not keep to the teachings of these great people.

23:57.031 --> 24:02.791
All the teachings were absolutely to the point

24:03.751 --> 24:11.051
according to the time they were facing, according to the contemporary problems they were facing.

24:11.951 --> 24:18.911
But none of these have been able to keep the framework

24:19.371 --> 24:25.991
what they wanted to establish and all of them have deviated, without exception.

24:26.311 --> 24:32.591
Some are money oriented, some are power oriented, some are politics oriented,

24:33.111 --> 24:37.751
none of them are Spirit oriented - this very surprising.

24:40.371 --> 24:47.831
There came lots of philosophies, theories and deviations that people formed.

24:48.851 --> 24:54.571
Many religions out of one religion, many philosophies out of one.

24:58.031 --> 25:05.571
So people lost faith in religions also lost faith in God,

25:06.971 --> 25:11.311
lost faith in Divinity - they took to Science

25:12.411 --> 25:16.451
and what Science has given us, you know very well.

25:17.751 --> 25:23.771
It has given up physical slavery to Science - complete slavery.

25:24.451 --> 25:31.851
We can't live without electricity, we can't live without plastic -

25:33.131 --> 25:37.631
above all we have to live with Atomic bomb and Hydrogen bomb.

25:39.291 --> 25:44.731
This is what Science has done again to make compartments

25:49.831 --> 25:55.491
Also the artificial theories that came up in the West

25:55.771 --> 26:03.551
and in the East also - we have lots of intellectuals even in India - which is just a mental projection

26:04.691 --> 26:09.151
and this mental projection moves in a linear direction

26:09.671 --> 26:16.931
and again recoils back like boomeranging, the idea, the very idea which was projected.

26:18.691 --> 26:26.691
Thus we find confusion in these modern times that is one of the characters

26:27.751 --> 26:34.811
of the modern times that people will be confused. They will not know what is the truth, what is not the truth

26:35.691 --> 26:43.751
and then they'll groping for it and when they will be groping for it there will be many in the market, will be selling the truth.

26:48.671 --> 26:54.711
This all has happened already. Most of the sellers have been exposed

26:55.751 --> 27:02.751
and people have realized that there must be something more like an evolutionary process

27:03.451 --> 27:07.731
which is a living energy which works it out.

27:10.151 --> 27:15.891
So, we have reached the rational conclusion that there has to be something beyond

27:18.331 --> 27:26.311
to know the Truth which is Absolute. We don't live on a Absolute level - it's all relative.

27:27.211 --> 27:33.311
Some say communism is good, some say materialism is good, some say capitalism is good

27:33.771 --> 27:36.811
but everywhere you go to find it has failed.

27:37.491 --> 27:43.151
I've been now to all these countries who used to be such staunch believers of

27:43.531 --> 27:49.951
Communists, Communism and also democracy. So one is money-oriented,

27:50.251 --> 27:54.091
another is power-oriented

27:57.031 --> 28:04.251
If you see the infrastructure of all these

28:05.971 --> 28:13.631
great philosophies put into our practice, you'll be amazed to see that it's all broken, finished

28:15.251 --> 28:20.831
and there's nothing that you could call as the Absolute Truth.

28:22.711 --> 28:28.551
All their political policies, economic policies , everything in a turmoil

28:28.791 --> 28:34.851
and it's nothing but experiencing on [UNCLEAR]. This experiencing

28:36.091 --> 28:42.331
works out against the very principle of what they wanted to do.

28:43.731 --> 28:51.571
That's how you find the fake gurus, that's why you find the people are so confused. Whatever they thought was absolutely right,

28:52.211 --> 28:58.911
has turned against them, so what is it that we have to do, where have we missed the point,

28:59.651 --> 29:02.771
where have all these religions have missed the point?

29:03.351 --> 29:09.451
You'll be amazed if you read about Christianity or Islam or Buddhism,

29:11.111 --> 29:19.111
Jainism, Sikhism, any of these things, you will be amazed the principles of all these are about the same

29:20.011 --> 29:24.931
and so beautiful. No rigidity,

29:25.771 --> 29:33.451
there is no fundamentalism, no chance of fundamentalism, encompassing everyone

29:34.851 --> 29:43.171
but the way people have become now - they're so antagonistic. They think they are the best, the rest are useless.

29:44.471 --> 29:51.711
How can any religion divide people? No respect for any knowledge

29:52.331 --> 30:00.371
neither any seeking. The second [UNCLEAR] as I told you - either it is the power or it is the money,

30:01.671 --> 30:05.751
nothing beyond that. Are we

30:08.591 --> 30:15.071
just here for these temporary powers or

30:17.031 --> 30:23.371
for this money which is already showing it's teeth to us?

30:24.531 --> 30:27.891
What are we here for, what is the purpose of our life,

30:28.691 --> 30:34.671
why God has made us from amoeba to human stage, what was His mechanism,

30:36.831 --> 30:43.511
what was His desiring? If this is His mechanism, which He has very nicely built,

30:43.971 --> 30:51.251
nicely built on such a subtle level that we have to just feel it -

30:52.011 --> 30:59.351
this is all there. Now, when I'm talking to you, you should not take Me for granted because blind faith is not going to help you at all

30:59.931 --> 31:04.751
but should be treated as a hypothesis

31:05.251 --> 31:09.651
and should have a very scientific attitude of a very open mind.

31:10.551 --> 31:17.451
When you have that kind of a open mind, then you'll see that if it works, if

31:18.591 --> 31:24.971
you get connected with this All-Pervading power and a real yoga, the union takes place

31:25.311 --> 31:32.691
and you can feel it on your finger-tips, this All-Pervading power of God which is described in every,

31:33.171 --> 31:38.051
every scripture. You may call it by any name, doesn't matter.

31:38.571 --> 31:43.471
The seed is called by several names all over the world - seed remains seed.

31:44.951 --> 31:52.671
If you can feel that, then you are at that point of Absolute Truth. At this Absolute Truth

31:53.851 --> 32:00.251
you can never divide human beings because everybody knows the same truth,

32:01.331 --> 32:04.991
everybody achieving that truth within himself.

32:05.511 --> 32:11.291
The second thing which has failed our religions, our philosophies, our politics is that

32:12.271 --> 32:19.551
that whatever we believe be true or whatever we follow did not became an innate part and parcel of us -

32:20.451 --> 32:25.231
is outward. For example, I'd say about Christianity -

32:27.131 --> 32:35.071
Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes." What a subtle sense of morality!

32:37.311 --> 32:43.071
Even the eyes should not be adulterous - there should be no lust and no greed in the eyes.

32:44.331 --> 32:48.371
If you find Christians, they are away from this.

32:49.631 --> 32:57.091
They have a brand. They have Christian brand, this brand, that brand. [UNCLEAR] Christ has said, "You're to be born again,"

32:58.211 --> 33:03.411
so they brand themselves, "We're born again." Just by branding you do not become that.

33:04.571 --> 33:10.391
You have to be what you are talking about.

33:11.311 --> 33:16.171
Whatever you talk, you have to walk the same way but that's not possible for human-beings.

33:17.471 --> 33:25.471
I've been with Mahatma Gandhi and he was a very great disciplined personality himself and he used to discipline others also.

33:26.411 --> 33:32.871
Tremendous disciplining he had and at that time, I found, the people

33:33.191 --> 33:40.051
become very disciplined, very righteous, very good - all kinds of things happened just when he, till he lived

33:40.471 --> 33:46.211
but when he died everything dropped down - nothing left there.

33:46.791 --> 33:51.511
Dropped down like a worn out coat, everything was thrown away.

33:52.291 --> 33:59.411
What was the reason? They believed that Gandhiji was very good, alright -

33:59.971 --> 34:06.191
they said they followed Mahatma Gandhi but they didn't imbibe anything that Mahatma Gandhi was saying.

34:06.771 --> 34:13.551
But it is not possible unless and until you are the Spirit, you do not have the power,

34:14.111 --> 34:21.691
you cannot bear even money, power, relationships, anything.

34:23.091 --> 34:28.591
It's something that is missing in human-beings. Until this missing point is there,

34:28.951 --> 34:32.971
we cannot reach what we are supposed to feel.

34:35.431 --> 34:43.451
And we are in Canberra and you must be knowing My husband has been a beaurocrat all his life and I've seen most of them.

34:44.251 --> 34:49.751
I have to tell them that there is a Kingdom of God into which we have to [UNCLEAR - ENTER?]

34:50.291 --> 34:55.271
then only we can change, then we can change

34:57.751 --> 35:04.691
everything that looks so confusing, everything that is all the time in the danger of being exposed,

35:05.351 --> 35:11.911
everything that we are afraid of because you really jump into that new awareness

35:12.631 --> 35:16.311
and in that new awareness, you see things very clearly.

35:18.891 --> 35:26.791
At the human level what do we do? We live either in the past or in the future -

35:27.811 --> 35:34.711
we cannot be in the present. At this moment you are not in the present just

35:37.031 --> 35:45.011
you stop listening to Me immediately some thought will come from your past or from your future like the waves,

35:45.571 --> 35:50.611
waves of the sea and you think you are be drowned in these waves -

35:50.891 --> 35:56.371
there are some thoughts which are very frightening, very few thoughts are there which really nourish you.

35:58.591 --> 36:06.511
But supposing, you get out of that and sit in a boat, then you can watch, you can watch all these thoughts

36:07.211 --> 36:14.471
without being in thought, that is you become thoughtlessly aware.

36:16.011 --> 36:23.011
You just watch these thoughts and watch your problems and supposing you learn how to swim, you can jump in

36:23.251 --> 36:29.991
and save many others and give them that life which you have achieved.

36:30.591 --> 36:38.351
But as a result of this, what you get is not the mundane thoughts but you become a master.

36:38.911 --> 36:45.611
If you want, you can think about it and then you'll be surprised, the revelation that you get.

36:46.211 --> 36:50.351
The revelation about the problems that you have, the revelation

36:51.071 --> 36:55.451
about others, about yourself.

36:57.111 --> 37:04.711
This can only happen if this Kundalini rises within you and pierces through your fontanel bone area

37:06.091 --> 37:10.351
and you become one with this living force

37:11.031 --> 37:15.331
which we call as All-Pervading power of God's love.

37:15.591 --> 37:23.651
You can call it as Param Chaitanya, in Sanskrit it's called. Some call it Brahm Chaitanya, some call it Ruh - there are many names given to this.

37:26.291 --> 37:30.391
When we see these beautiful flowers here, we take them for granted.

37:31.611 --> 37:36.991
How do these flowers got their beautiful colors - from this Mother Earth,

37:38.351 --> 37:45.911
from a little bit seed that we had planted, how this Canberra has been

37:46.231 --> 37:52.951
enriched with such beautiful trees and flowers? We just take it for granted - who has done this?

37:53.751 --> 37:58.091
Who has made us from amoeba to this stage?

37:59.871 --> 38:07.011
Look at our eyes, what a camera it is! Look at our brain, what a computer! Who has programmed it?

38:07.691 --> 38:13.611
We just take everything for granted but there is a power which is All-Pervading,

38:14.091 --> 38:17.211
which exists in each and every atom,

38:19.011 --> 38:24.671
which exists so close to us, works all the time

38:25.871 --> 38:31.391
but we are not aware of it. They say there is an Autonomous Nervous System within us

38:31.711 --> 38:38.131
which has got Sympathetic and Parasympathetic, two types of nervous systems

38:39.491 --> 38:44.131
but who is this Auto - just giving a name doesn't solve the problem.

38:45.371 --> 38:52.451
This Auto is the Spirit, is the Spirit which is the reflection of God Almighty.

38:53.171 --> 39:01.171
In those days of Science to talk about God also is criminal but He exists. Whether you like it or not, it can be proved.

39:01.811 --> 39:05.631
It can be only proved when you become a realized soul,

39:06.711 --> 39:13.791
when you become an enlightened soul otherwise it cannot be proved.

39:14.391 --> 39:20.171
Just like supposing you take a leaf and show to someone and say there are lots of cells in it -

39:20.591 --> 39:27.811
unless and until you have a microscope, to see the subtle side of a leaf, you cannot convince anyone. In the same way,

39:28.191 --> 39:35.031
unless and until, you get your Self-realization you cannot, by no means

39:35.391 --> 39:42.811
you can achieve the proof of God, proof of Divinity, proof of Spirituality

39:43.271 --> 39:49.391
and you are all that, you are Divine, you are glorious within yourself.

39:49.631 --> 39:55.691
All these powers are within you, this Kundalini is within you, all these chakras are within you

39:56.051 --> 40:03.591
and only thing is that you have to expand your awareness after your Self-realization.

40:05.071 --> 40:11.311
All these problems are your own so why not, why not we get it? If it's our own

40:12.491 --> 40:19.371
why not we have it? If we have a small little hut somewhere we will  fight with the courts, go all over the world to take it out.

40:19.551 --> 40:22.851
But what about the powers that you have within yourself?

40:24.511 --> 40:29.391
Such a lot of property that you have which will not only

40:29.931 --> 40:36.951
give you physical, mental, emotional, complete nourishment, complete balance

40:38.411 --> 40:44.071
but also the peace that is promised and the blessings.

40:45.011 --> 40:52.051
Above all you become a part and parcel of the whole -

40:52.451 --> 40:58.511
the microcosm becomes the macrocosm. You just become - it's the question of becoming.

40:58.771 --> 41:06.111
It's not just giving a lecture to you that this is this - claiming something but it has to happen - it's the actualization I'm talking about.

41:06.671 --> 41:13.231
The actualization of baptism that is to take place. It's not just certificate, it's not just like a [UNCLEAR - FLOWERISATION?].

41:13.591 --> 41:19.851
It has to work out innately within you and then all your innate qualities start showing

41:20.231 --> 41:25.771
It's a fact that by this Kundalini awakening blood cancer

41:26.031 --> 41:30.791
another type of cancer - so many diseases have been cured all over the world.

41:31.411 --> 41:36.991
We don't advertise it too much because that means all the time I'll be busy with the sick people only

41:37.251 --> 41:43.071
but it's better to create doctors out of you that you can heal, cure people.

41:43.631 --> 41:50.891
There're three doctors in Delhi [UNCLEAR - THEY LIVE IN?]  another capital like Canberra, where we have three doctors who have got

41:51.151 --> 41:55.491
their MD after doing MBBS in sahaja yoga

41:55.871 --> 42:02.111
to show, certain diseases they have shown which have been cured by sahaja yoga.

42:03.691 --> 42:10.231
Now this is not the only thing that you have to achieve, that you should just get your health

42:10.631 --> 42:17.391
alright, it's not the point. What you have to have is a complete command and understanding

42:17.771 --> 42:22.871
of the Divine laws and they should be innately enlightened within you.

42:23.751 --> 42:28.251
Then, you become righteous, righteous with love,

42:29.411 --> 42:35.971
you become a person who is your own, as if you are your own master.

42:36.751 --> 42:42.151
The guideline is the light of your Spirit and when the Spirit shines

42:43.751 --> 42:48.951
in your attention, then you become an enlightened person.

42:49.311 --> 42:54.671
It starts showing on your Central Nervous system, you can feel it on your finger-tips.

42:55.791 --> 43:03.391
There's cool breeze all over - cool breeze of the Holy Ghost they call it and also this is what you feel first time

43:03.711 --> 43:11.111
is the All-Pervading subtle power which you have never felt before. Then only thing you have to know, how to

43:11.831 --> 43:16.671
use this power for your benefit and for the benefit of others.

43:17.151 --> 43:22.831
And then you jump into another dimension which we call as Collective Consciousness.

43:23.471 --> 43:30.471
The consciousness you have at the most about yourself - also that's not complete. Supposing somebody is getting a cancer, he's not conscious of it,

43:30.831 --> 43:37.911
supposing somebody is getting mad, he's not conscious of it but with this awareness, as soon as you get

43:38.191 --> 43:43.271
into some trouble, you get conscious of it because you're conscious of

43:43.591 --> 43:51.311
your centers which are on the Parasympathetic Nervous system. Doctors will admit honestly that they don't know anything about Parasympathetic

43:51.791 --> 43:55.991
but it is a realized soul who knows all about it

43:56.191 --> 44:01.591
and he has complete control over his Parasympathetic Nervous system which is the central path.

44:05.551 --> 44:10.331
So, this is a fulfilment of all the promises, this is a fulfilment

44:10.631 --> 44:17.871
of all the scriptures and fulfilment of all the theories that are political or economic [UNCLEAR - EVERYTHING?]]

44:18.311 --> 44:24.231
Now for example I would say, if I want the powers, I'm a Capitalist because I want the powers

44:24.571 --> 44:32.771
but I cannot exist with them, I have to distribute so I'm the greatest Communist - at this old age of Mine I'm going round the whole world

44:33.231 --> 44:40.031
travelling, travelling distributing it because I'm a Communist as well - I cannot enjoy them Myself.

44:41.631 --> 44:49.451
So, a personality which is developed, is the fulfilment of all our ideas which were running short of the Truth.

44:50.411 --> 44:58.151
The Truth was missing. That Truth has now show it, itself to you that you are in control of it.

44:58.791 --> 45:03.591
You know how to handle this power and how to give realizations to others.

45:04.991 --> 45:13.031
The Spirit, which is in your attention, is so powerful that a person who has reached

45:13.631 --> 45:20.771
a certain height of his development which we call as doubtless awareness, Nirvikalpa Samadhi -

45:21.051 --> 45:27.211
that state is achieved in no time - can sitting down here can tell you what's wrong with someone

45:27.591 --> 45:33.931
on the chakras. They talk the language of chakras not [UNCLEAR - OUT OF OR OUTER?] person wearing this dress or that dress

45:34.231 --> 45:38.291
but language of the chakras - what's wrong with you, what's wrong with others.

45:39.711 --> 45:46.711
And if you know how somehow, somehow if you find out how to correct those things, you can correct people, you can correct yourself

45:47.591 --> 45:53.871
without feeling obliged or without feeling that you're obliging others.

45:54.271 --> 46:01.391
It just the thing that who is the other? If this finger is paining,

46:01.851 --> 46:07.231
if I look after it, after all the finger is not obliged to Me and I'm not obliged to finger.

46:07.451 --> 46:14.151
In the same way if you become a society of people who have brotherhood which is innate,

46:14.711 --> 46:22.071
a society of people who are morality which is innate, society of people which has got

46:23.611 --> 46:28.751
spirituality which is innate, then who is the other?

46:30.151 --> 46:36.511
We have such a society built in now. Sahaja yoga is now working in 55 nations, as they say,

46:37.051 --> 46:43.231
and we get people in India, once a year, from all kinds of countries -

46:43.751 --> 46:49.671
Russia, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland on this side

46:49.951 --> 46:57.031
also England, France, uh.. Spain, Italy, Switzerland

46:57.911 --> 47:04.231
America - North America, South America, Australia, Japan

47:04.891 --> 47:08.711
East, East Asian countries - from all over.

47:10.311 --> 47:16.771
I've not been to most of them - Africa, South Africa but if you see them

47:17.291 --> 47:24.151
such love, such understanding, such enjoyment of each other. There's no question

47:24.551 --> 47:29.891
of any quarrel or fights, such humour, such sweetness -

47:30.671 --> 47:38.691
it's really such a society has been already spontaneously formed. There are no rules and regulations,

47:38.951 --> 47:44.871
there's no compulsion but your Spirit. Spirit is the one which guides you and if everyone

47:45.851 --> 47:51.171
has the same reflection of the Spirit, there's not going to be any

47:51.751 --> 47:58.071
problem because everybody feels the same love. If you have ten children who are realized souls

47:58.551 --> 48:06.191
and if you tie a, a bandage on their eyes and ask them, "What's wrong with this gentleman?"

48:06.651 --> 48:13.491
they will all point out the same finger. Supposing they point out this finger, you ask that fellow, "Have you got bad, very bad,

48:13.731 --> 48:19.431
trouble with the throat?" "Yes, but how do you know?" "Because the children are showing the finger

48:19.731 --> 48:22.711
which indicates that this is the problem."

48:24.991 --> 48:31.611
So, there is no need to refer it to any uh.. sort of a specialist,

48:31.831 --> 48:36.851
everybody is a specialist - even the children know, even the children understand.

48:37.111 --> 48:41.731
The other day we had a telephone, we had some sahaja yogi, sahaja yogi sitting there [UNCLEAR]

48:42.171 --> 48:49.031
I said, "Just receive that phone." He said, "Mother, there's somebody but he's not a yogi," finished. He put down the phone.

48:49.291 --> 48:56.191
They have told him, "You're not a yogi, first become a yogi, then tell him." Put down - came and told Me that "Mother, he's not a yogi."

48:59.651 --> 49:06.391
This is just building at your roots, just there - only thing you have to cope around.

49:06.951 --> 49:11.951
But we run after things which have advertising and all kinds of falsehood.

49:15.051 --> 49:22.071
One thing one should understand, you cannot sell it. How much did we pay to Mother Earth for these flowers,

49:22.591 --> 49:27.071
how much did we pay to saints,

49:27.851 --> 49:32.251
to great prophets, to Incarnations?

49:33.671 --> 49:39.591
It's a living process of your evolution and you can't pay for it

49:40.071 --> 49:47.871
but as soon as I say that people think it's something wrong in it because they don't understand anything for which you cannot pay.

49:49.951 --> 49:56.591
It's a very surprising thing democracy, where people have so much of [UNCLEAR] so much talk of God.

49:57.091 --> 50:04.471
Every country has got a church or something there accepted as something final

50:05.731 --> 50:10.471
but none of them are seeking the truth.

50:11.691 --> 50:17.271
They're just comfortable with whatever they have, whatever they are doing.

50:17.571 --> 50:24.251
They're not understanding that this is done by their forefathers and their forefathers - what have they achieved?

50:24.871 --> 50:32.151
But now there's a special category of people, a very special category, which William Blake has called

50:32.471 --> 50:39.871
as people of God, "They will know God and they will make others know God."

50:40.871 --> 50:48.911
These are the people who are as seekers, they're [UNCLEAR - SCIENTISTS?] but so many are lost because of the falsehood

50:50.031 --> 50:57.971
that came in this world and people got enamored by it. Whatever it is, it is for us to decide

50:58.291 --> 51:03.731
what we have to achieve. There's so much to be told about it, so much

51:04.031 --> 51:09.751
and you know, I must have given four five thousand lectures in only in English language and many other languages

51:10.491 --> 51:14.611
but this lecturing is just a

51:16.151 --> 51:23.871
net of words 'Shabd Jaal'. It can only indicate that this is the Truth.

51:25.191 --> 51:30.851
but you have to go there - it's like a signboard. But if you just stand there and read the book

51:31.311 --> 51:34.651
and read the signboard all the time, you'll never reach there.

51:35.631 --> 51:41.391
You have to go and see for yourself. Reading about Australia, you don't go to Australia

51:42.951 --> 51:50.051
in the same way, by reading about anything or listening about it, you don't go there. And this is what it's not a mental feat

51:50.491 --> 51:58.271
it's beyond that - a evolutionary process by which you become the Spirit which is a very small little distance you have to cross

51:58.531 --> 52:02.871
which is your own, for which you cannot pay, is sahaja means spontaneous.

52:04.071 --> 52:11.831
You don't have to stand on your heads, you don't have to go to Himalaya, you don't have to do all these torturesome things and you don't have to [UNCLEAR],

52:13.091 --> 52:20.991
you have to enjoy and this is so simple, looks so fantastic - it is, it is very fantastic.

52:21.871 --> 52:28.871
See this now. This instrument was [UNCLEAR - STANDING?], everything was built but the connection was not there - it had no meaning.

52:29.531 --> 52:36.611
In the same way if you're not connected to the truth, you'll have no meaning. You're leading a life which is meaningless,

52:37.371 --> 52:44.591
which has no satisfaction, which has no fulfilment

52:45.751 --> 52:51.431
and it is innately built in you, is this pure power

52:51.871 --> 52:57.271
what you call the pure desire power of Kundalini which is your mother,

52:57.551 --> 53:01.151
which is an individual mother, she knows all about you.

53:03.571 --> 53:11.171
There are people who go on doubting all the time - it's easy to doubt but I would say that

53:11.451 --> 53:18.371
it's easier to get your Self-realization, why not we get it, what should be the objection?

53:21.571 --> 53:27.871
I hope, you will have wisdom to understand what I've said and you stick to your realization.

53:28.431 --> 53:33.291
Of course, I would like to have some questions from you because

53:33.871 --> 53:41.471
I do not want at the time when we are trying to ascend, your mind should just peep in and say, "Oh, you should have asked this question."

53:41.751 --> 53:44.691
but I'd like you to ask Me some questions.

53:45.371 --> 53:51.951
Because there's complete freedom in sahaja yoga - you have to have Absolute Freedom and for that you have to have complete freedom.

53:56.151 --> 54:03.031
What's up? Still not alright? The connection is loose.

54:05.431 --> 54:08.371
[UNCLEAR N INAUDIBLE]

54:21.071 --> 54:26.351
Now, you have put it off. Hello Neeraj, he's put it off again.

54:27.811 --> 54:34.291
- [UNCLEAR]
- It's alright.

54:35.551 --> 54:38.631
Interesting.

54:40.591 --> 54:46.691
[LAUGHTER] [UNCLEAR] Off [ALL LAUGH]

54:59.611 --> 55:05.891
No questions? ... that nourishes them, establishes them - the complete balance

55:06.191 --> 55:10.031
and then is connected with the mains and

55:10.431 --> 55:15.751
this energy then starts flowing through all the time.

55:20.591 --> 55:25.371
Homeopathic is alright in a way

55:26.451 --> 55:29.371
but I would say, that also is symptomatic.

55:30.271 --> 55:36.831
What is your symptom? You go to a homeopath, he'll ask you ten questions. I mean, sometimes you won't even know what to answer.

55:37.231 --> 55:43.951
Then he'll say that, "Alright, I'll give you this medicine, you try." Then suddenly you find boils coming out of your body

55:45.091 --> 55:49.551
so you say, now this has happened. He'll say, "No, no it's alright. It's coming out, is alright.

55:49.771 --> 55:54.571
Uh.. your antibodies have been activated and they're fighting it out."

55:56.531 --> 56:04.531
But in sahaja yoga it's not symptomatic. It's not from outside you treat but from inside

56:05.451 --> 56:09.831
in the sense that, when the Kundalini rises,

56:10.231 --> 56:14.891
She passes through the centers, specially the center which we call as the Center heart.

56:16.431 --> 56:24.191
Center heart is the center which creates antibodies till the age of 12 years or so

56:24.811 --> 56:28.351
and then these antibodies are distributed in the whole body.

56:29.791 --> 56:34.991
Whenever you're afraid or when there's problem, there's attack from outside,

56:35.471 --> 56:42.231
then this sternum bone starts pulsating and it's a remote control and conveys the danger

56:43.531 --> 56:50.251
to these antibodies but here, you challenge the antibodies all the time.

56:50.551 --> 56:57.171
It's like giving a vaccination sort of a thing. When you challenge the antibodies, afterwards they get tired

56:58.591 --> 57:04.611
so that also system is not alright. Now instead of that, you must nourish the antibodies.

57:06.491 --> 57:11.831
That's what is done through sahaja yoga - they can become very strong, active.

57:12.371 --> 57:18.991
So many antibodies are killed by this but with sahaja yoga, they not only

57:19.811 --> 57:24.791
are nourished but they live very long and they have greater sense to fight the disease.

57:32.331 --> 57:35.851
In both these systems there's no talk of Spirit at all.

57:44.091 --> 57:47.131
It doesn't deal only with your physical side.

57:49.131 --> 57:53.811
Physical is not everything. I've met people who are uh.. very healthy people.

57:54.051 --> 57:57.291
They have come to Me saying that, "Mother, we want peace."

58:00.571 --> 58:07.071
Some people say, "I don't know how to love." Specially people who are over healthy uh..do not know how to love others,

58:07.771 --> 58:14.271
to have compassion. Mostly people who do Hatha yoga for physical upliftment

58:14.691 --> 58:20.931
or who jog also, they become very dry, extremely dry and end up with a divorce or something.

58:21.771 --> 58:28.171
So only one-sided development is not good - we are not only physical beings. We are mental beings,

58:28.631 --> 58:32.871
above all we are Spiritual beings so we have to have a balance.

58:44.611 --> 58:51.291
[INAUDIBLE]

58:51.531 --> 58:55.451
[INAUDIBLE]

58:58.251 --> 59:05.631
[INAUDIBLE] She says she doesn't know anything about sahaja yoga, how many attempts would be necessary to?

59:05.951 --> 59:11.651
Oh, it's good. No, no, not many attempts are needed only just now

59:11.891 --> 59:18.351
you'll be awakened. I'm sure you all will be awakened this evening. We have a center here,

59:19.171 --> 59:25.131
very good center, we are very senior sahaja yogies, in the sense they may not be in age but in knowledge

59:25.491 --> 59:33.511
and they'll tell you all about it, absolutely free. It's not like this that first lecture is free and the rest is all [UNCLEAR -LYNCHING?] - it's not like that.

59:34.371 --> 59:42.211
But you have to give some time to yourself, you have to respect yourself and your Self-realization. What happens, people get their Self-realization

59:42.451 --> 59:47.931
and after that they are like just sprouted beans - finished. So you have to grow.

59:48.351 --> 59:56.251
It's very easy to understand, it's so simple and they'll manage it for you, you must just listen to them, practice it

59:56.691 --> 01:00:02.431
and you'll be amazed it's such a miraculous thing, it's such a miraculous thing

01:00:02.771 --> 01:00:06.271
and so many things happen unbelievable.

01:00:07.391 --> 01:00:13.631
You're all the time under protection, you're looked after materially also,

01:00:15.211 --> 01:00:19.471
familywise, in every way - it's another world you enter into.

01:00:25.071 --> 01:00:34.011
[INAUDIBLE]

01:00:37.971 --> 01:00:46.011
[INAUDIBLE] Some organizations like TM charge money but sahaja yoga doesn't, why is this possible?

01:00:46.811 --> 01:00:54.411
Hunh! TM - better not say anything about horrible thing like TM, I mean, you are asked Me, I have to tell you.

01:00:55.331 --> 01:00:59.911
Actually, I come across it long time back

01:01:00.571 --> 01:01:07.511
when a gentleman called Peter Pears who was running the flying academy in Runnock

01:01:09.611 --> 01:01:14.831
and I don't know, people are so silly that they join this academy.

01:01:15.451 --> 01:01:18.491
Then he brought many TM people to Me and

01:01:18.991 --> 01:01:24.491
they were all in a mess, absolutely in a mess. This fellow had epilepsy, his wife had epilepsy

01:01:24.751 --> 01:01:30.711
and his director - they have big, big names - director, deputy director, president, this, that

01:01:31.091 --> 01:01:37.851
and Mr. Director also had epilepsy and the little girl she too has had epilepsy.

01:01:38.291 --> 01:01:43.431
Luckily in those days My husband had gone on leave

01:01:43.831 --> 01:01:48.391
so I asked them, "Come and settle down in My house, I'll work it out." Very difficult days!

01:01:49.131 --> 01:01:56.771
I worked it out, ofcourse, they got their realization and epilepsy went away. They had become completely bankrupt

01:01:57.071 --> 01:02:05.151
because TM was taking all the money in Switzerland and sending all the students there to learn how to jump, I mean, to, to be

01:02:05.471 --> 01:02:10.311
uh.. what you call, levitate - absurd.

01:02:12.371 --> 01:02:19.311
Why do people want to levitate, I don't know what is the need? Already we have problems

01:02:19.631 --> 01:02:24.891
with our traffic [LAUGHTER]

01:02:25.451 --> 01:02:31.131
Think of people levitating half-way, I mean, really it's stupidity, nothing but stupidity.

01:02:32.611 --> 01:02:36.791
And then this gentleman told Me all the story about TM.

01:02:37.031 --> 01:02:41.191
I was shocked, I mean, how could people take to such a nonsense!

01:02:42.171 --> 01:02:47.091
First of all he told Me that they called him that they will give him a mantra, all of them

01:02:47.471 --> 01:02:53.931
and these mantras were given by somebody who was sitting there, specially this guru of theirs, they called him giggly guru.

01:02:54.271 --> 01:03:02.091
Used to giggle must be giggling because that must be thinking how stupid these people are! [LAUGHTER]

01:03:02.511 --> 01:03:08.431
I mean naturally - and he would give them a, a mantra.

01:03:09.211 --> 01:03:16.011
Now, if there are Indians they'll understand, and very in great secrecy. You see, you had to give them flowers, this, that, I don't know.

01:03:16.251 --> 01:03:21.371
And they had to pay three hundred pounds beforehand before entering into that room.

01:03:21.751 --> 01:03:28.491
And this guru would give them a mantra which was 'Inga', 'Pinga' and 'Thinga' - now Indians  know, understand.

01:03:28.831 --> 01:03:33.311
And you are not supposed to tell anybody about it. He didn't even know Sanskrit, can you imagine!

01:03:33.731 --> 01:03:39.931
Now 'Inga' means what - 'Inga' means the bite of a scorpion, in a local language.

01:03:40.291 --> 01:03:47.051
'Pinga' means when a person gets a spirit he goes round and round -'Pinga' and 'Thinga' is when you show it somebody like this.

01:03:47.331 --> 01:03:54.071
[LAUGHTER] And they paid three hundred pounds for that. [LAUGHTER]

01:03:55.591 --> 01:04:01.271
Then the second course started, people got very sick with that - they pained and all that.

01:04:01.531 --> 01:04:07.371
So many, even bureaucrats from India, went into that nonsense - that painful time.

01:04:08.651 --> 01:04:13.131
Then they did another course that is of levitation.

01:04:14.411 --> 01:04:20.251
So they told Me there's a barrister, a Jew lady, she told Me how she suffered.

01:04:22.191 --> 01:04:27.251
They were all asked to go to Switzerland in a very remote hotel

01:04:28.171 --> 01:04:35.491
and they had to pay six thousand pounds for that course, apart from travelling and all that

01:04:36.611 --> 01:04:43.711
and there were uh... what you call, foams,

01:04:44.251 --> 01:04:51.891
foams kept about one foot high and they were asked to jump on it. The course was for seven days

01:04:52.511 --> 01:04:59.111
and for five days they had to drink the water which had boiled the potatoes

01:05:00.171 --> 01:05:07.671
and the sixth day they had to eat the rind of the potatoes and the seventh day they were given the potatoes -

01:05:08.491 --> 01:05:12.471
for six thousand pounds [LAUGHTER]

01:05:14.171 --> 01:05:19.431
It's a fact, I tell you, it's a fact and stupidly they did it!

01:05:20.291 --> 01:05:27.551
And they jumped on these things and broke all their bottoms and they, you know, there was a case in America against them

01:05:28.531 --> 01:05:34.811
and when they and they're very good at money because after all if you earn money like this, you see,

01:05:35.351 --> 01:05:39.111
and they claimed  money, they gave the money - hushed out.

01:05:40.451 --> 01:05:48.171
And also very criminal - they tried to kill this Peter Pears. They threw him out of the train one day somebody.

01:05:49.371 --> 01:05:54.351
So, they are good at advertising;  Every time they start a new stuff.

01:05:54.611 --> 01:05:58.451
This time they have started, say Ayurveda - for Ayurveda, why do you need TM?

01:06:00.371 --> 01:06:07.411
Ayurveda cannot work out in the West because the uh.. medicines and all that are made

01:06:08.271 --> 01:06:16.231
in the fields of India. Unless and until they are made into pills and things, they cannot be used but for that you don't need TM.

01:06:17.791 --> 01:06:25.831
If you want to do Ayurveda, is better that you get directly from some Ayurvedic society something but why to have this TM in between?

01:06:26.951 --> 01:06:34.551
And talking that you become very dynamic. In the beginning, you see, it's all what we call is as Shamshan Vidya, is the

01:06:34.811 --> 01:06:41.031
uh... Spirits they use. So if you put a, if you put a Spirit on somebody

01:06:41.551 --> 01:06:48.771
that person is so ambitious, the Spirit itself, and then this person ambitious, they become very ambitious, both of them.

01:06:49.191 --> 01:06:55.371
But a horse on which two persons are sitting, that horse becomes absolutely tired after sometime, though it runs fast.

01:06:56.991 --> 01:07:05.011
And then they are recluses - there are so many recluses in TM. They have no money, they have taken out their children from schools.

01:07:05.751 --> 01:07:12.951
I mean, it's true they charge lot of money, I've already told you. But sahaja yoga has nothing to do with this kind of a nonsense absolutely.

01:07:13.971 --> 01:07:21.951
All those people, have already told you, taking money from you, in the name of consciousness, awareness, are all cheats, take it from Me, all of them.

01:07:22.831 --> 01:07:29.311
But still is on. You know about Rajneesh how he was but still, in Australia, you find so many

01:07:29.551 --> 01:07:37.291
disciples of Rajneesh still going mad. They are all suffering so much all from so many troubles - very painful diseases they have

01:07:37.811 --> 01:07:44.111
but what to do? They don't want to come to truth - some sort of a mania if it is.

01:07:44.771 --> 01:07:50.771
I asked people that why do you want to pay, he said, "Then you're sure that there's something we'll achieve."

01:07:51.051 --> 01:07:56.391
But I said, "How are you sure? Because you're paying for it, because there's a commitment."

01:07:56.671 --> 01:08:03.731
I said, "How much will you pay for your Self-realization, it is so invaluable, how much?"

01:08:05.891 --> 01:08:12.351
We should use our brains but surprisingly, most of the bureaucrats are in it, in this team.

01:08:14.131 --> 01:08:21.071
And there are some people who are paid money to give advertisement, like this Peter Pears, was told to say that

01:08:21.631 --> 01:08:27.911
he was sitting there and he was meditating, suddenly he passed through the wall. But I said, "Why did you tell a lie?"

01:08:28.171 --> 01:08:36.271
He said, "I told more lies." "What?" He said I told them, "I came to America without a passport, without anything, just through this levitation."

01:08:36.491 --> 01:08:42.031
But I said, "Why did you tell such lies?" He said, "He was a very rich diamond merchant

01:08:42.231 --> 01:08:47.871
and all the money was involved into this. When I got into it completely upto this much

01:08:48.111 --> 01:08:53.431
then this guruji told me that if you don't tell lies, how will you recover your money - you have to tell lies."

01:08:56.431 --> 01:09:01.951
Just imagine, you just go to America sitting down here - and people believe it.

01:09:02.891 --> 01:09:07.671
And they advertise with these people. They pay them and ask them to write such things.

01:09:08.931 --> 01:09:12.231
Why? It's all money-making.

01:09:15.231 --> 01:09:22.411
But I don't know the credibility of this man, especially in India. My husband has been a bureaucrat, a well known bureaucrat, he has so many awards

01:09:22.711 --> 01:09:28.631
I think, he has got the maximum number of awards uh.. from all the nations

01:09:28.771 --> 01:09:34.451
he's, I mean, in the who's who it's written that he's the man who has been awarded the most.

01:09:35.411 --> 01:09:41.711
They won't trust Me, they will trust this man who was just a ticket collector once upon a time.

01:09:43.411 --> 01:09:46.471
Can you imagine?

01:09:50.931 --> 01:09:56.271
Whole thing is such a fraud but people like it

01:09:57.171 --> 01:10:01.131
and you have freedom to waste your money where ever you feel like - you can't help it.

01:10:04.911 --> 01:10:10.671
It's a fact. This man is writing a book now, Peter Pears, but he still has problems.

01:10:10.931 --> 01:10:15.831
Suffered a lot, suffered a lot, this man, he's become a bankrupt and he had to go to South Africa.

01:10:19.931 --> 01:10:27.951
Because you have asked Me, I've told you otherwise no use describing these horrible things to you - makes the whole atmosphere bad.

01:10:29.331 --> 01:10:36.531
Just think, just think of something nice. Any other question, please?

01:11:13.271 --> 01:11:16.471
Buddha has described

01:11:19.591 --> 01:11:25.551
I don't know if you have read about Buddhism, even the Buddhist don't read.

01:11:25.991 --> 01:11:33.171
He said that when Buddha will come,  the future Buddha, he's [UNCLEAR] Matreya, means the Three Mothers  put together - Matreya,

01:11:34.411 --> 01:11:41.871
when Buddhism will come, to it's future state, then there will be Bodhisattwa

01:11:42.431 --> 01:11:47.891
means the persons will get their realization, they'll become Buddhas but it won't be individual,

01:11:48.131 --> 01:11:55.971
it won't be through hardships and all that but they'll get it, their realization and then that will be put to the use of the people,

01:11:56.891 --> 01:12:03.851
to the use of the public and also for the use of solving the multiple problems.

01:12:04.271 --> 01:12:11.491
All these problems can be solved through sahaja yoga. Ecological problem can be solved only through transformation of beings

01:12:12.271 --> 01:12:19.771
because it's human-beings who have brought this. Once they're transformed, all the problems they have created, can be solved.

01:12:22.211 --> 01:12:28.031
So you have to give it and it's most enjoyable thing is to give realization to others -

01:12:28.471 --> 01:12:31.311
greatest enjoyment in doing that.

01:12:35.791 --> 01:12:41.651
Yes please. [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:42.211 --> 01:12:48.231
- Do animals have chakras and Kundalini?
- Yes, yes they have but not so developed as you have.

01:12:48.791 --> 01:12:55.451
We have a very good uh... system which is completely sorted out

01:12:55.731 --> 01:13:00.751
This is a deep subject but the brain of a man is like a prism

01:13:01.031 --> 01:13:06.151
and because of that whatever energy falls on this brain

01:13:06.951 --> 01:13:12.171
is, goes into refraction

01:13:12.571 --> 01:13:19.191
and because of refraction we have a clear cut three systems built-in within us -

01:13:19.531 --> 01:13:22.831
two sympathetic, left and right and the Parasympathetic

01:13:23.931 --> 01:13:31.471
and so it's a very systematically sorted out. Like in our evolutionary process we used to have say,

01:13:32.011 --> 01:13:40.051
lights, electricity in a very different manner. Gradually it is improving, improvement and today it's in a very

01:13:41.051 --> 01:13:48.311
great state of evolution. In the same way, we have been born

01:13:50.051 --> 01:13:55.851
in such a manner that it is very suitable for our evolution

01:13:56.251 --> 01:14:03.311
but animals also evolve, animals are also evolving. These days when you see all kinds of poor people,

01:14:03.551 --> 01:14:10.011
all kinds of uh.. people who have no feelings for others - they must be coming from some

01:14:10.231 --> 01:14:17.111
hyaena group or something like that otherwise how can they be without any heart, without any love -

01:14:18.091 --> 01:14:23.931
so dry. So they are also evolving.

01:14:28.491 --> 01:14:35.231
We have already evolved, we have reached. We are at the end of, epitome of the evolution, we are at the top

01:14:35.451 --> 01:14:38.671
you have to just jump a little more and that's what it is.

01:14:39.071 --> 01:14:44.931
That's why human-beings must be respected the most, much more than animals or anyone else.

01:14:52.331 --> 01:14:58.671
Alright, I think we have had quite a lot of questions and also you'll be satisfied.

01:14:58.931 --> 01:15:05.611
Later on whenever you want to know about it, you can write to Me or you can write to these people but in any case I hope

01:15:06.791 --> 01:15:09.891
after realization you will not give it up

01:15:11.031 --> 01:15:17.411
and just [UNCLEAR - TAKE TO IT?] because we do not take money from you and that's why [UNCLEAR - LET'S NOT?] involve it

01:15:18.851 --> 01:15:23.271
but as you know there are still problems within us.

01:15:23.611 --> 01:15:30.671
The Kundalini passes through a very subtle, small, central channel - we call it as Brahma Nadi

01:15:31.031 --> 01:15:35.451
and She opens up, no doubt but the connection is not complete -

01:15:36.291 --> 01:15:41.671
sometimes it goes down to various places. Supposing, you have a liver trouble, it will go down to liver trouble,

01:15:41.931 --> 01:15:49.191
to other mental trouble or any kind of a trouble like spiritual trouble can come if you have done like TM or anything.

01:15:49.731 --> 01:15:55.291
If such a thing has happened, then this Kundalini goes to those places and works it out.

01:15:55.491 --> 01:16:01.471
Now what you have to know, is a very simple thing, is that how do we cleanse ourselves.

01:16:02.331 --> 01:16:08.651
We don't go to Himalayas, we don't go fasting, we don't give up our families - nothing of the kind.

01:16:09.031 --> 01:16:13.771
We are where we are. We are not to give up any place, any position, anything .

01:16:14.111 --> 01:16:21.231
And to develop within, what is the solution? The solution is that you have to go to the collective

01:16:22.991 --> 01:16:30.791
without feeling what is your position in life, forgetting all that. We don't have elaborate ashrams and all that because we don't make money.

01:16:31.111 --> 01:16:37.351
It's a humble place. Whatever it is, with humility you must go there, with the collective you have to be.

01:16:38.071 --> 01:16:44.091
And if you are humble, if you go to the collective, you'll not only

01:16:44.711 --> 01:16:50.191
know about sahaja yoga but also you'll grow very fast and the cleansing takes place.

01:16:50.431 --> 01:16:57.431
Without the collective, cleansing doesn't take place. That's the only way you can cleanse and you can master it.

01:16:58.331 --> 01:17:02.491
For that you don't have to pay, nothing of the kind.

01:17:06.411 --> 01:17:12.111
If you find any discrepancies, you should write to Me - everybody is free to write.

01:17:16.691 --> 01:17:21.751
Because that's how you're purified without any problems, without any [UNCLEAR - DIFFERENCE OR DIFFICULTIES?]

01:17:22.191 --> 01:17:29.431
Also a kind of a individual meditation has to be done, which they will tell you - five minutes in the morning, ten minutes in the evening.

01:17:29.651 --> 01:17:35.571
It's not done but you become, you are in meditation for five minutes and ten minutes in the night

01:17:35.971 --> 01:17:43.531
that cleanses you but collective is very important. In the collective to absorb the vibrations

01:17:43.951 --> 01:17:51.431
uh.. what you call, this Chaitanya, this Divine power - in the collective and it cleanses you.

01:17:52.351 --> 01:17:57.871
Such a different thing to be in Collective and you'll be amazed how it will work out.

01:18:00.171 --> 01:18:05.131
But that has to be promised that you will have to do the collective.

01:18:06.131 --> 01:18:11.651
There's no commitment if you want to give realization, you can give, if you don't want to give doesn't matter,

01:18:12.011 --> 01:18:18.511
if you want to evolve yourself, you can evolve yourself but you will feel that because the compassion

01:18:21.511 --> 01:18:28.351
and you get concerned about your surroundings, you get concerned about people.

01:18:29.131 --> 01:18:36.051
It's a personality that develops uh.. which is so full of love, full of feelings

01:18:36.391 --> 01:18:40.691
and strength and knowledge so what to do it, you don't want to waste it.

01:18:41.751 --> 01:18:49.171
I never force anyone to do anything nor will you forced to do anything whatever you want to do, you get it, you can do it

01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:53.391
but you have to be in the collective, that's very important.

01:18:58.371 --> 01:19:04.611
[UNCLEAR] civil to be because no use watching others

01:19:04.851 --> 01:19:12.791
because that creates problems for others. If you want to have realization, then you're welcome and you should get it.

01:19:13.891 --> 01:19:17.591
The second condition is very simple again

01:19:19.451 --> 01:19:22.451
that you're not to feel guilty about anything.

01:19:22.791 --> 01:19:26.791
Past is past is finished now, at this moment you are in the present.

01:19:27.371 --> 01:19:34.711
To a mother a child is never guilty so please, take away the guilt if there is anything in your head

01:19:35.111 --> 01:19:39.231
because also I think, English language has too much of this - sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:19:39.431 --> 01:19:45.291
Formerly when we were young, we used to say, I beg your pardon before, now they say sorry - everything is sorry.

01:19:45.511 --> 01:19:51.151
What is there to be sorry about? You have to be happy, joyous - so not to feel guilty at all,

01:19:51.951 --> 01:19:59.411
not to blame yourself for anything, please - you are not at all guilty about anything.

01:20:00.351 --> 01:20:05.691
Small, small things we talk of which makes us guilty

01:20:05.991 --> 01:20:13.191
also these religious teachings, so called, that you are a sinner, you're this, you pay so much money - nothing of the kind.

01:20:13.771 --> 01:20:20.751
In sahaja yoga first thing you must know you are a human-being, you are a seeker that's why you're here and you're not guilty.

01:20:21.051 --> 01:20:25.911
Even if you have done mistakes, if you have gone to wrong places, doesn't matter we can correct it

01:20:26.551 --> 01:20:32.331
but don't feel guilty about it that, "I went to this place, I did this, I did that." It  will automatically work out

01:20:33.371 --> 01:20:40.251
and you'll be surprised to see your own growth. You should not condemn yourself for anything at all -

01:20:40.991 --> 01:20:46.991
this is first condition. Then the second condition is

01:20:48.751 --> 01:20:52.751
that you have to forgive everyone, in general.

01:20:53.771 --> 01:20:58.551
Whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything - what do you do, nothing.

01:20:59.711 --> 01:21:07.691
But when you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands. Those who have tortured you are very happy people while you are bothering yourself too much.

01:21:10.571 --> 01:21:17.731
So, you have to forgive - in general means that you don't have to think of these things which have hurt you

01:21:17.971 --> 01:21:25.511
or the people who have hurt you but in general you should say, "I forgive everyone." You'll feel much lighter even now - you forgive everyone.

01:21:27.731 --> 01:21:33.511
That means, in short, that you must be very pleasantly placed towards yourself that you are a human-being,

01:21:34.291 --> 01:21:42.351
that you have every right, your birth-right to get this yoga, to get this union with the Divine, there's Divinity within you which has to rise.

01:21:44.391 --> 01:21:52.511
If you just understand that it is your birthright as human-being and as a human-being you are at the epitome of evolution

01:21:54.051 --> 01:21:58.211
be happy about it, be pleasantly placed towards yourself

01:21:58.891 --> 01:22:04.191
do not to condemn yourself for anything that you have done in the past - forget it.

01:22:04.571 --> 01:22:10.651
Your mother is Kundalini, knows everything about you and She knows how to manage the way through it.

01:22:11.771 --> 01:22:18.091
She has recorded everything within Herself like a tape recorder so you don't have to worry, you don't judge yourself.

01:22:19.111 --> 01:22:24.111
She will know how to manage, She's so anxious to give this re-birth.

01:22:28.171 --> 01:22:36.171
These are very simple conditions which may look difficult to some people - is not, is just a mental idea.

01:22:38.191 --> 01:22:44.811
Forget it. You have to love yourself as I love you, that's the point

01:22:46.971 --> 01:22:51.371
and respect, very important because you're seekers.

01:22:51.791 --> 01:22:57.391
You're seekers of truth and that's why you're much higher than the rest of the world.

01:23:01.571 --> 01:23:05.891
Now there's one more thing which should not upset you that we have to take out our shoes

01:23:06.151 --> 01:23:10.911
uh.. whether you're sitting on the ground or on the chair because it's better

01:23:12.211 --> 01:23:15.291
that uh.. we touch the Mother Earth with our feet.

01:23:15.951 --> 01:23:21.271
Mother Earth sucks, sucks in any negative [UNCLEAR - WANTS OR FORMS?] that are within us, just.

01:23:24.151 --> 01:23:28.271
Also if you have anything very tight in the neck or on the waist, you can just loosen it little bit.

01:23:29.091 --> 01:23:34.751
So, you should be comfortable. Imagine, sitting on the chair you're going to get your Self-realization! Comfortable.

01:23:35.311 --> 01:23:43.571
Don't have to go to Himalayas to stand on your head for 10 years - just here, within ten minutes you're going to get your Self-realization.

01:23:56.251 --> 01:23:59.211
First we'll show you

01:23:59.851 --> 01:24:07.391
and you will nourish your own centers. This is for only once you have to know later on there's no need at all. After Self-realization

01:24:07.631 --> 01:24:14.311
they'll tell you how to raise your Kundalini yourself, how to make the connection alright but in the beginning I will just tell you.

01:24:18.071 --> 01:24:24.951
Now the left side of the Left Sympathetic is the power of desire, of ordinary desire not pure desire -

01:24:25.911 --> 01:24:33.371
pure desire is the Kundalini - and the right side is the power of action so we put the left hand, like this, on our lap,

01:24:33.731 --> 01:24:38.751
very comfortably - you have to sit not too much straight,

01:24:39.331 --> 01:24:43.491
bending back or slouching but in a normal straight manner.

01:24:44.471 --> 01:24:47.411
Please put the left hand, like this, on your lap

01:24:48.691 --> 01:24:54.131
and have full confidence. This is one of the most important thing is to have full confidence in yourself

01:24:54.591 --> 01:24:58.011
that you are going to get realization - no doubt.

01:25:00.771 --> 01:25:04.251
Now the right hand we'll use for nourishing our centers.

01:25:05.511 --> 01:25:13.071
The first thing is the Spirit which resides in the heart so we put our right hand on our heart, is the Spirit.

01:25:14.071 --> 01:25:19.531
If you're wearing a coat, you can put inside the coat on the right hand.

01:25:27.871 --> 01:25:31.271
Now, if you're the Spirit, you become your own master

01:25:32.491 --> 01:25:40.271
so the center for your mastery is on the left-hand side of your stomach or you can call abdomen on the upper side.

01:25:42.011 --> 01:25:49.991
We're working only on the left-hand side. In the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, you put your fingers and press it a little.

01:25:51.271 --> 01:25:59.351
This is the center of your mastery - this is created by great masters, prophets, which is to be enlightened.

01:26:04.471 --> 01:26:10.731
Then you have to take down your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

01:26:12.171 --> 01:26:19.051
This is the center of pure knowledge of Divine laws and also the knowledge how to work it out -

01:26:19.431 --> 01:26:22.411
it's very important.

01:26:25.091 --> 01:26:29.911
Then again you have to put your hand in the upper portion of our abdomen on the left hand side.

01:26:33.291 --> 01:26:37.851
Please all of you have to do it, please all of you do it.

01:26:39.371 --> 01:26:44.371
Now put your right hand on your heart, again.

01:26:49.391 --> 01:26:55.711
Now when you feel guilty the center here

01:26:56.711 --> 01:27:02.991
on, in the corner of your neck and your shoulder, here catches very badly

01:27:04.091 --> 01:27:12.091
and gives you diseases like Angina, Spondylitis - on the whole it makes your organs very lethargic

01:27:13.271 --> 01:27:20.671
so it's no use being guilty. Now turn your head to your right and press it hard here, as much as you can,

01:27:24.991 --> 01:27:29.531
knowing that you're not guilty in the eyes of God.

01:27:32.211 --> 01:27:37.411
Now, put your right hand on top of your forehead across

01:27:38.351 --> 01:27:46.091
and you can press it on both the sides - one side with the thumb, another side with your fingers

01:27:46.431 --> 01:27:52.231
and put down your head as far as possible. This is a center to forgive,

01:27:52.531 --> 01:27:55.711
to forgive everyone in general.

01:27:58.811 --> 01:28:06.031
We'll do that later on just now I'm showing you where to put your hand. Now please, take your right hand on the back side of your head

01:28:08.031 --> 01:28:11.011
and push back your head as far as possible.

01:28:15.831 --> 01:28:21.391
This is the center, where without feeling guilty - push back your head as far as possible.

01:28:22.231 --> 01:28:29.311
This is the center where, without feeling guilty, without condemning yourself, without counting your mistakes,

01:28:29.911 --> 01:28:37.211
for your own satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from this All-Pervading Divine power of love.

01:28:38.391 --> 01:28:44.271
Now, stretch your hand fully. Now the last center - very important.

01:28:44.891 --> 01:28:52.871
Put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:28:54.271 --> 01:29:01.931
Put the center properly. Now, push back your fingers - this is for the actualization of the baptism, as they say.

01:29:02.751 --> 01:29:10.671
Push back your fingers so that there's a good pressure on your scalp. Now please put down your head, as far as possible

01:29:12.331 --> 01:29:17.991
and now move your scalp, slowly, clockwise, seven times.

01:29:21.991 --> 01:29:27.911
Please move your scalp slowly, clockwise, seven times. Put down your head.

01:29:28.451 --> 01:29:36.451
This is the last center called as Sahastrara, means the lotus of thousand petals, which covers the limbic area.

01:29:50.951 --> 01:29:54.811
Now, that's all we have to do, that's all.

01:29:56.851 --> 01:30:03.851
You'll have to close your eyes, when I tell you, you can take out your spectacles - later on you can put them on.

01:30:05.831 --> 01:30:13.891
You have to put both your feet apart from each other, as I told you there are two powers separate - one complementary to other.

01:30:14.851 --> 01:30:18.751
Just put both the feet apart from each other. Put the left hand towards Me

01:30:22.911 --> 01:30:26.191
and now put the right hand on your heart.

01:30:27.491 --> 01:30:34.231
Please close your eyes. Put close them slowly, not pressing them down but just

01:30:37.331 --> 01:30:43.771
close them so that the lids are not pressed and compressed.

01:30:44.751 --> 01:30:47.711
Now here

01:30:55.811 --> 01:31:02.951
you have to ask Me a very fundamental question about yourself, three times in your heart.

01:31:05.331 --> 01:31:12.511
Please ask a question within your heart - you can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji whatever you feel like.

01:31:14.531 --> 01:31:21.751
"Mother, am I the Spirit?" ask this question in your heart. "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

01:31:35.571 --> 01:31:43.451
In the heart resides the Spirit and if you are the Spirit, you become your own master, your own guide, your own guru.

01:31:44.091 --> 01:31:51.811
So now, please take down your right hand into the upper portion of your abdomen

01:31:52.311 --> 01:31:55.671
on the left-hand side and press it, not very hard.

01:31:57.291 --> 01:32:01.791
This is the center for the principle of mastery.

01:32:02.411 --> 01:32:07.191
So now, you ask another, very fundamental question in your heart, three times

01:32:08.711 --> 01:32:15.271
"Mother, am I my own master? Mother, am I my own master?"

01:32:15.811 --> 01:32:19.491
Ask this question three times in your heart.

01:32:43.811 --> 01:32:47.611
I've already told you that I respect your freedom

01:32:49.071 --> 01:32:53.851
and I cannot force pure knowledge on you - you have to ask for it.

01:32:54.851 --> 01:32:59.731
So now, please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side

01:33:00.171 --> 01:33:05.411
and here you have to ask six times because this center has got six petals,

01:33:07.531 --> 01:33:10.631
"Mother, please give me pure knowledge."

01:33:13.811 --> 01:33:18.631
Ask six times, "Mother, please give me pure knowledge."

01:33:25.611 --> 01:33:33.651
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, your Kundalini starts rising

01:33:36.711 --> 01:33:39.851
and when She starts rising,

01:33:43.831 --> 01:33:47.991
we have to understand that we have to nourish all the centers

01:33:49.771 --> 01:33:55.711
which are upper centers so that it's easy for Her

01:33:57.271 --> 01:34:03.351
to pass through. This has to be done with our self-confidence in ourselves,

01:34:04.691 --> 01:34:11.651
with our self-esteem and knowing what glorious things we are.

01:34:12.891 --> 01:34:17.351
Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen and press it hard.

01:34:18.991 --> 01:34:22.011
Here

01:34:27.211 --> 01:34:34.571
you have to say, ten times, with full confidence, "Mother, I am my master."

01:34:37.171 --> 01:34:43.551
Say in your heart, "Mother I am my master, " ten times.

01:34:47.331 --> 01:34:50.331
Press it hard

01:34:56.051 --> 01:35:02.651
Now the fundamental truth about you is that, you're not this body, not this mind,

01:35:03.431 --> 01:35:09.311
not this intellect, nor these conditionings and not your ego -

01:35:09.971 --> 01:35:12.991
you are pure Spirit.

01:35:15.091 --> 01:35:18.171
So now, raise your right hand on your heart

01:35:22.911 --> 01:35:28.451
Here you have to

01:35:29.271 --> 01:35:32.431
say again with full confidence,

01:35:33.371 --> 01:35:40.811
"Mother, I am the Spirit, I am the pure Spirit, " say it twelve times.

01:35:41.431 --> 01:35:45.151
"Mother, I am the pure Spirit."

01:35:47.711 --> 01:35:52.351
This self-confidence will open your hearts, will open your chakras.

01:36:00.291 --> 01:36:08.291
You have to know that this All-Pervading power is the ocean of knowledge, is the ocean of compassion and love,

01:36:08.991 --> 01:36:14.771
is the ocean of bliss but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness

01:36:15.431 --> 01:36:21.331
so whatever you may do wrong, whatever you think was against

01:36:22.751 --> 01:36:27.731
goodness, please forgive just now, forgive yourself,

01:36:29.191 --> 01:36:33.791
completely forgive yourself because all

01:36:34.591 --> 01:36:40.951
these mistakes can be easily dissolved by the power of ocean of forgiveness.

01:36:42.631 --> 01:36:46.151
So now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck

01:36:49.591 --> 01:36:56.951
and, neck and the shoulder and turn your head to your right fully.

01:36:58.951 --> 01:37:04.851
Here, very much with your self-confidence, you have to say sixteen times

01:37:06.131 --> 01:37:11.951
because this center has got sixteen petals, sixteen times with full confidence,

01:37:12.291 --> 01:37:19.871
"Mother, I'm not guilty at all, Mother, I'm not guilty at all."  Whatever people might have told you, forget it.

01:37:20.651 --> 01:37:25.111
"Mother, I'm not guilty at all, " please say it sixteen times.

01:37:30.911 --> 01:37:35.951
I've already told you, whether you forgive or don't forgive,

01:37:36.791 --> 01:37:41.031
you don't do anything. On the contrary you play into wrong hands.

01:37:42.251 --> 01:37:47.431
Those who have tortured you, are not troubled, while you are troubled.

01:37:53.651 --> 01:38:00.491
So you have to forgive all of them. Now raise your hand on your forehead across,

01:38:01.211 --> 01:38:04.251
press it hard on both the sides.

01:38:05.711 --> 01:38:09.131
Please put down your head, please put down your head.

01:38:09.291 --> 01:38:14.771
Here you have to say from your heart, not how many times, from your heart you have to say,

01:38:15.951 --> 01:38:20.311
"Mother, I forgive everyone, in general."

01:38:22.671 --> 01:38:26.691
"Mother, I forgive everyone, in general."

01:38:38.111 --> 01:38:45.591
Please say it from your heart. This center is a very constricted small center on the cross of

01:38:46.811 --> 01:38:52.251
optic chiasma - it has to open out only by your forgiveness.

01:38:54.651 --> 01:39:00.851
Now, put your right hand on the back side of your head

01:39:02.351 --> 01:39:09.031
on the optic lobe, as they call it, and push back your head as far back as possible towards the sky.

01:39:12.011 --> 01:39:19.971
Here, you have to say for your own satisfaction, not counting your mistakes,

01:39:26.671 --> 01:39:34.631
"Oh Divine power, if I have done anything wrong knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me."

01:39:43.711 --> 01:39:47.691
"Oh Divine power, if I have done anything

01:39:48.591 --> 01:39:51.591
wrong against you, please forgive me."

01:39:51.891 --> 01:39:59.311
And you have to say this again with your heart, not how many times but from your heart you have to say.

01:40:09.951 --> 01:40:15.391
Now, stretch your hand,

01:40:16.391 --> 01:40:19.471
stretch your palm fully

01:40:24.391 --> 01:40:27.411
and put the center

01:40:28.171 --> 01:40:35.111
of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area, which is a soft bone in your childhood.

01:40:36.491 --> 01:40:42.811
Now, put down your head, as far as possible,  put down your head, as far as possible,

01:40:43.231 --> 01:40:49.591
and most important is to push back your fingers so there's a good pressure on your scalp.

01:40:51.271 --> 01:40:58.271
Again here, I cannot cross your freedom, I respect it. I cannot force

01:40:58.611 --> 01:41:05.371
Self-realization on you. Please push back your fingers, please push back. Now you have to move your hand seven times,

01:41:06.191 --> 01:41:13.791
clockwise, slowly or we should say you have to move your scalp, is better. At that time you have to say seven times,

01:41:14.291 --> 01:41:21.311
"Mother, please give me Self-realization," seven times, "Mother, please give me Self-realization,"

01:41:21.551 --> 01:41:25.231
and it will work out. Please put down your head, please.

01:41:29.031 --> 01:41:33.531
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:41:34.571 --> 01:41:40.971

01:41:41.351 --> 01:41:44.271

01:41:53.171 --> 01:42:01.171
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE] Now please take down your hands, slowly open your eyes.

01:42:02.551 --> 01:42:10.391
You can put on your glasses. Now, put both the hands towards Me, like this. Watch Me without thinking.

01:42:11.591 --> 01:42:19.011
You just watch Me without thinking - you can do it. This is thoughtless awareness, Nirvichar Samadhi.

01:42:22.671 --> 01:42:29.871
Now, put the right hand towards Me, like this. Put right hand on - please bend your head

01:42:30.551 --> 01:42:38.591
and put your left hand on, not touching it, on top of your head, on the fontanel bone area

01:42:39.031 --> 01:42:42.811
and move it and see if there is a cool breeze

01:42:43.631 --> 01:42:51.091
or a warm breeze coming out of your head. Some people will get hot breeze - they have bad liver or if they have not forgiven. Even now you can forgive.

01:42:51.491 --> 01:42:58.451
See for yourself - bend your head. See for yourself if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head.

01:43:06.151 --> 01:43:14.031
Now put the left hand towards Me - bend your head, without bending you won't know. Left hand towards Me. Now bend your head as, and see for yourself

01:43:14.511 --> 01:43:20.791
if there is a cool or a hot breeze. Sometimes it is very close, sometimes it's very far away like a jet.

01:43:21.331 --> 01:43:27.831
See now for yourself, there's a cool or a warm or a hot air coming out of your own head. You have to certify

01:43:28.131 --> 01:43:31.111
[UNCLEAR - BEND NOW?], if it is there, just see it.

Now please put your right hand again, once again. Bend your head and see for yourself

01:43:49.491 --> 01:43:56.811
with the left hand. Now, not to touch your head, little away, little away.

01:44:04.051 --> 01:44:10.191
Now raise both the hands towards the sky, like this. Here, straight, push back your head

01:44:10.511 --> 01:44:13.491
and ask a question three times,

01:44:15.071 --> 01:44:20.311
"Mother, is this the All- Pervading power of God's love?"

01:44:21.391 --> 01:44:27.491
or you can ask another question three times, "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

01:44:28.051 --> 01:44:34.491
or another question three times, "Mother, is this the Param Chaitanya, Mother, is this the Brahma Chaitanya?"

01:44:35.051 --> 01:44:39.311
Ask any one of these questions, three times, in your heart.

01:44:44.251 --> 01:44:48.791
Push back your head towards the sky.

01:44:51.891 --> 01:44:54.951
Now bring it down.

01:44:56.831 --> 01:45:01.311
First you'll feel very relaxed. Now put your hands like this.

01:45:03.631 --> 01:45:09.391
Those who have felt cool or warm or a hot breeze on their fingers or on their hands

01:45:09.871 --> 01:45:14.751
or out of their fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands.

01:45:19.951 --> 01:45:25.671
So beautiful! I bow to you all, your saintliness. May God bless you!

01:45:26.191 --> 01:45:31.471
Please continue with it. All of you have got it in Canberra - it's remarkable!

01:45:32.111 --> 01:45:38.971
May God bless you! But all of you should come. It's not that so many get realization and four five people come in.

01:45:39.291 --> 01:45:46.311
It's a very slow progress. You are so deep and you must know your depth. Please remember

01:45:46.591 --> 01:45:49.571
that all of you have to come.

01:45:52.191 --> 01:45:58.431
It's little late but I don't mind meeting you, if you have time - you can come, I would like to meet you all. [UNCLEAR]
