00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:43.829
When we say we are seeking, we must know that
we are a special category of people.

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.489
People were seeking before also.

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:58.230
They were seeking power, money, possessions,
affluence, every sort of thing.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:07.240
Still they are not satisfied - those who have
got it.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:18.210
And so those who are seeking the truth are
the highest, highest of all in the evolution.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:29.500
They are the ones who are going to jump into
that higher state which is called as self-realization.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.490
If you are not seeking, then nobody can force
seeking on you.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.780
It cannot be done.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:48.940
Even by force, if you take somebody to the
beautiful lake of nectar of God's love and

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:56.000
even if you force the person to drink it,
it is you who has to enjoy it and unless and

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.913
until you have the seeking, you will not have
the sensitivity to enjoy that nectar.

00:01:59.913 --> 00:02:06.190
And truth is what it is.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:13.500
We cannot change it, we cannot organize it,
we cannot transform it.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.000
It is, it has been, it will be.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.890
And what is the truth?

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:33.900
The truth is that God loves us, that His divine
power of love is all-pervading, is everywhere,

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:42.139
that this power is acting all the time - it
is a living power of a living God - and that

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:48.489
this power does all the things that we call
as living work of God.

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.700
A flower is transformed into a fruit by this
power.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.739
This body we get out of that power.

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.430
From amoeba to this stage we have come out
of that power.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.409
The whole world is created out of that power.

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:12.180
In everything that power resides and works
out, sorts out, co-ordinates things for us.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.959
Above all, it is the love of God.

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.129
It's the compassion of God.

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:28.010
We human beings have not got the comprehension
of His love; we try to see Him through our

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:34.139
own angles, through our short sight, through
our blinkers that we have got.

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.730
He is the ocean, ocean of love.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:44.169
All the oceans put together cannot be compared
with that ocean of love, that ocean of forgiveness,

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:48.549
an ocean of complete well-being for us.

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:53.279
Only thing, we have to jump into it.

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:58.400
We have to enter into His kingdom.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.909
That is what one has to do.

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:05.409
When it is accomplished, then you are just
there.

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:08.450
You are looked after.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:15.779
That is the domain of God I am talking about
and there, when you enter in, as a by-product,

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:23.170
all kinds of well-being are blessed upon you,
just they are bestowed upon you.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.320
You just get them automatically.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.340
But this happening also is not our doing.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.280
This also is the doing of God.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:41.199
He has arranged us in this way that you can
see in the chart - this is the life tree - or

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.460
you (can) say the tree of life as described.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.160
And this is the one that is within us already
placed.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:59.040
All these centers, which are subtle centers,
are expressed outside as gross centers.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.600
When this residual force of Kundalini, which
people must have explained to you, from that

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:12.840
sacred bone or sacrum rises and pierces through
all these centers, it enlightens all of them

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.190
one by one.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:21.590
By that enlightenment only, you get your physical
well-being, your mental well-being, your emotional

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.420
well-being and ultimately, your spiritual
well being.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.820
That means you become the spirit.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.660
Once you become that absolute, the absolute,
then all relativity drops off.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.730
We actually live in a relative world which
is false, which is not true.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.840
This power has its own telecommunication.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:49.500
It's so tremendous that it is unbelievable
that such a power exists around us and we

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.350
are not aware of it.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.110
We are not aware of many things.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.250
We are not aware that this Mother Earth is
moving with such a tremendous speed.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.440
We are standing on top of that; nothing happens
to you.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.690
We are not aware of the gravity.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:10.740
We are not aware of many things because God
is so kind, so gentle and so thoughtful that

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.110
He wants us to live happily as human beings.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:23.110
So He doesn't want us to hear some things
which are not good for us, for our ears, so

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.670
He makes the frequency of these things so
sharp that we can't hear with these ears.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:33.150
Some of them, He makes them so low that you
can't hear.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.080
Only what you can hear and enjoy He makes
you hear.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:43.150
But we in our freedom have done a lot of wrong
to ourselves, to each other, to our society,

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.430
to the whole world.

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:57.360
Once we realize, this freedom is nothing but
is our ego, our ego, which has created this

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.060
problem for all other people.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:06.790
Then we have also another thing where we get
conditioned, which creates the superego.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:12.010
Now in our activity, which is the right side
sympathetic nervous system, we accumulate

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:18.700
this horrible thing called ego, because when
we act, we think we are doing it, we are in-charge.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.400
We are not.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.660
He is in charge.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.480
We are really doing nothing.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.750
What are we doing?

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:34.650
Like the people ask me, "Mother how can you
cure everything so easily?"

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.020
It's simple.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.402
How do you make a flower into a fruit?

00:07:37.402 --> 00:07:38.950
To us, we take it for granted.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:42.500
We are not bothered to find out, but can you
do it?

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.520
It's so difficult.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.430
Can you do it?

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.930
We can't.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:50.830
But if it is God's power, it can do it.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:56.040
So if you also have the God's power flowing
in you, which will happen to you as soon as

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.940
you get your realization, you can do it; anybody
can do it.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.009
It's very simple.

00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:06.280
Like any instrument, when it is put to the
mains, it starts acting and then we can see

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.510
that it is an instrument.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:12.580
Otherwise it looks like some funny stuff here.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:13.890
It has to be put to the mains.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:19.330
The instrument is ready, but within us these
two things, called the ego and superego as

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:25.810
a result of our activity and as a result of
our conditioning, are accumulated in our brain.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:29.400
These two are to be sucked in.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:37.289
That's very important because when they grow,
these two elements - or two, we can, say balloon-like

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:49.230
structures - they make a very strong gap filled
with calcium and you become an egg.

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:50.230
Another becomes an egg.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.889
Third person becomes an egg.

00:08:51.889 --> 00:08:57.760
You develop your I-ness - I am this, I am
that.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:04.020
All kinds of misidentifications start coming
on us.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:08.930
When this is to be sucked, what should we
do?

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:11.380
That's the question.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.640
What are we to do?

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.820
To raise the Kundalini.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:20.170
As I said, it is a living process and you
cannot do any living work - so just can't

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:21.170
do it.

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:22.170
It is as simple as that.

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.600
You yourself can't do it.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:32.110
But somebody who is enlightened, who is the
light, can enlighten another light, because

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:37.980
that light is ready, just ready, but you need
an enlightened light to enlighten that light.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.590
Once that light is enlightened, that light
can enlighten another light.

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:46.480
But the problem is when the light which is
enlightened tries to say that "You are to

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.560
be enlightened," immediately you hit that
person.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.940
You don't like it because ego is there, which
is ignorance.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.750
That's how people like Christ were crucified.

00:09:55.750 --> 00:10:00.310
What wrong did He do to people except that,
see, He said, "I am the light?"

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:01.310
It's true.

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:02.310
He was the light.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.020
No doubt that He was the son of God.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:09.270
It's true, He was the son of God which you
can prove - on vibrations.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:13.030
By this Sahaja Yoga, you can prove it what
He was.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:16.470
He was that, but that time people killed Him.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:17.470
Why?

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:21.400
Only because He said, "I am the light," and
that you were to be enlightened by Him.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:28.380
You allowed him to live only for four years,
and when He was killed, when He was crucified,

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:33.620
you took advantage out of that and made all
kinds of artificial things out of it.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.460
He could not explain many things which He
talked.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.570
He could not say anything.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.480
On the cross He said, "It has been accomplished."

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.760
What has been accomplished?

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.730
Nobody thinks about it - what has been accomplished.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:53.490
So we have to take reference from other people,
those who have been deeper than us, who have

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:57.389
gone into it, who have found out certain things
about Christ.

00:10:57.389 --> 00:11:03.510
And they say that Christ accomplished the
greatest thing, the greatest feat, because

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.900
He was nothing but Omkara.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.810
He was nothing but the vibrations.

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:14.050
That's why He had no body and only He could
accomplish it.

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:15.050
And what did He do?

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:22.090
Is to accomplish Himself on this cross where
we have this ego and superego.

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:23.740
Of course they say that He said he died for
our sins.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:24.740
How did He die for our sins?

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:29.290
We say that He died for our sins.

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:34.230
We accept it, yes, because Churches are telling,
people are telling, Bible is telling.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.490
But how?

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:36.640
He suffered for us.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.540
Then why are we suffering?

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:43.830
But when He said, "You are to be born again,"
we don't pay any attention to that.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:45.870
For that you have found out an escape.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:53.080
You take your child to the church and they
put some water artificially and you accept,

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.430
"All right, we are born again."

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:58.570
I met people who are certified born again.

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:01.460
They quarrel with me and fought with me for
nothing at all.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:04.130
I said, "How are you born again?

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:08.560
If you are born again, that means an egg becomes
a bird.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.650
Have you become something different?

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:14.050
Is there any transformation in you?

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:15.050
How do you believe?

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:16.050
Why are you so self-opinionated?

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:20.890
If you are born again, what happens to you?

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:21.890
What happens to you?

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:23.790
What is born again in you?"

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:30.890
Born again is nothing but the Kundalini awakening,
which rises on top of your head and here is

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:33.420
the seat of your Spirit.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:38.470
Of course, it resides in your heart, but the
seat of the Spirit is here, and once it touches

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:43.770
that seat, immediately you start feeling that
subtle thing which is all-pervading within

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:44.770
you.

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:47.089
For the first time you feel this cool breeze
of the Holy Ghost.

00:12:47.089 --> 00:12:55.350
Holy Ghost is nothing but the power of God,
the power of His love, which is called as

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:57.910
Adi Shakti in Sanskrit language.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:03.930
We don't have to accept anything else from
outside, any dictionary we don't have to accept

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:09.899
to give answers to things, to mysteries that
we have been suffering all these days.

00:13:09.899 --> 00:13:21.990
Once this cross, which is between the ego
and superego is enlightened, Christ is awakened

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.990
there.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:30.110
He sucks in both these things, your karmas,
your actions and your conditionings, your

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:31.110
sins.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.110
It is sucked in.

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:35.730
There is no more for you to suffer.

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:37.089
Why do you want to suffer?

00:13:37.089 --> 00:13:42.250
Some people have started another theory that
we must suffer if we have to go to Christ.

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:43.250
Why?

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:46.191
Did He not suffer for you sufficiently?

00:13:46.191 --> 00:13:47.191
Did He not do that?

00:13:47.191 --> 00:13:49.530
He has done it, then why suffer?

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:53.600
Be joyous that He established himself there
at that point.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:59.100
In the Hindu scriptures, He is called as Maha
Vishnu.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.880
But if I tell this to them that this was Christ,
they won't believe Me.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.123
If I tell this to Christians, they won't believe
Me.

00:14:05.123 --> 00:14:08.450
They don't want to believe it because for
them Christ is their contract.

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:13.029
They have a contract with Christ, as if they
are the contractors of Christ.

00:14:13.029 --> 00:14:14.310
Nobody dare say anything about Christ.

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:19.830
It's only they who are the Christians, and
they who are the Hindus, they who are the

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:25.080
Sikhs, they who are the Muslims and they don't
know anything about reality.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:31.580
Just fighting morning till evening in the
name of God, the One who is the ocean of love,

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:34.490
compassion and bliss.

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:44.600
They are so disturbed, so upset, so violent
that one can easily see there is nowhere the

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.040
blessings of God.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.450
There is no blissful state.

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:49.970
There is no peace in them.

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:56.530
Because there is no peace within, how can
you have the peace without?

00:14:56.530 --> 00:15:01.110
And this is what it is that one should understand
- that in the name of God, many things have

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:03.740
been done which are absolutely against it.

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:08.470
They are anti-God activities because if you
become a fanatic, you are anti-God, absolutely

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:09.470
anti-God.

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:15.240
You have to see that God exists for the whole
universe.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:20.000
Nobody can take His contract and can organize
it.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.630
When I say this, of course there will be people
who are interested in things with which they

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:26.630
are identified.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:32.260
They want to carry on with that kind of identification;
maybe they get some money out of it, maybe

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.270
some sort of a name or something free.

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:36.990
But what is most important is your Spirit.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:41.460
Why identify with anything else but your own
spirit?

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.590
You cannot get money out of it.

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:44.590
No.

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:46.230
The joy of Spirit is the reward of Spirit.

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:47.529
Why do you want money?

00:15:47.529 --> 00:15:51.870
Why do you want fame for it?

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:55.980
Why do you want anything of these worldly
things that are so transitory, temporary,

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:57.260
will finish off?

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.730
Why not ask for something that is eternal?

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:03.010
Why not ask for the eternal life of Spirit?

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:07.820
And that if you ask, it is at your door steps,
you can get it.

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.570
It's very simple and easy.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:11.769
When you say it is simple, people can't understand.

00:16:11.769 --> 00:16:13.209
They think, "How can it be?

00:16:13.209 --> 00:16:18.480
You have to stand on your head for one life
then you have to stand on one leg for one

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.480
life."

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.720
That's the idea they have got about Christ.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:24.840
There is no need to do that - Christ has done
it for you.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.520
Believe me, He has done it.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:31.089
So now, how to understand it is simple?

00:16:31.089 --> 00:16:34.770
In this room, say, there are so many lights
and we all can see each other.

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:36.890
The room is enlightened.

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:38.170
But what did you do?

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:43.089
You just switched on one switch, very simple.

00:16:43.089 --> 00:16:44.380
If you ask anybody, "How do I put the light
on?"

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.380
I just put.

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:46.980
There is a light there.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.029
Just switch on.

00:16:48.029 --> 00:16:50.140
That's how you get the light.

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:53.950
But for a person who has never seen electricity,
it must be a wonder.

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:56.400
How just switching on light, so simple.

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.350
It is not in a way.

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:03.029
It is made simple for you, but there is a
big organization behind it.

00:17:03.029 --> 00:17:08.510
There is a big history behind it and there
are so many people who are working it out.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:11.890
There is a big machinery.

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:17.640
In the same way, whatever looks so simple
to us is tremendous, is great.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:25.199
But God Almighty with His care and tenderness
doesn't want you to know anything about it.

00:17:25.199 --> 00:17:26.270
Forget it.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:28.930
You just jump into it.

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:32.740
You just enter into the kingdom of God and
enjoy the bliss, that's all.

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:34.659
Why do you want to bother about these things?

00:17:34.659 --> 00:17:40.620
Of course, as we are very thought-oriented,
people want to know about it.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:44.660
That's why one has to talk about these things.

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:53.120
But best is to get your enlightenment first
and then talk of it.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:18:00.530
It's a headache to talk about the electricity
and about its history, where it enters and

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:05.750
the problems they have had and then after
all these when you have tumbled down, fallen

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:10.850
down, everybody hit each other, kicked each
other, then say, "All right, now it's very

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:11.850
simple.

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:12.890
Just put on the light."

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:16.880
It's better to be other way round, that I
say, "All right, put on the light, and then

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.530
we'll talk about it."

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:24.580
I am so happy to see so many people in Cambridge
today, really very happy because I have been

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.220
here before also.

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.110
But we had no response.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:29.250
I was surprised.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:33.950
Here where there are many false gurus are
working out their tricks.

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:39.450
People have collected thousands of pounds
from this place, Cambridge, which is the seat

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:40.559
of learning.

00:18:40.559 --> 00:18:47.020
Here so many educated people live, intelligent
people live - have been befooled completely

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.950
and have been pampered.

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:51.350
Their ego has been pampered.

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:55.930
They have gone into such trips which are very
dangerous.

00:18:55.930 --> 00:19:03.220
We had somebody from Cambridge in Sahaja Yoga,
very well educated person, got into epilepsy,

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:05.540
going to such a horrible fellow.

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:10.610
Lost all his money, everything, bankrupt and
also epileptic.

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:16.730
Educated, very well educated, first class
boy, ruined for his life.

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:22.120
But why it happens to us, we must think.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.540
Why we are enamored by such people?

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:30.550
Because we believe in the superficial thing;
because it is being advertised in such a way.

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:34.240
These people come with a circus because they
have to attract you.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.570
They have to attract you for their purses.

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:42.880
They have to attract you for their own powers
because they want that people should be dominated

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.320
by them because they can extract money.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:50.920
Their interests are very low, base and we
don't see it.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.309
We don't understand it.

00:19:52.309 --> 00:19:53.820
They pamper our ego.

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:56.502
They talk of big things, "We are going to
make you a minister.

00:19:56.502 --> 00:19:58.600
We are going to do this."

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.549
We say, "All right."

00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:02.980
We follow all this nonsense.

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:03.980
Imagine.

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.530
This ego is such a tricky thing.

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:11.730
It plays tricks not only with others but plays
with yourself also.

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:12.730
It cheats you.

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:17.740
The so-called intelligence of the ego can
cheat you and that's how many people are lost.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:23.820
Those who are seekers of ages are lost because
these horrible satanic forces know how to

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:31.890
play the trick, how to play the trick with
you and how to take you to their own domain

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:36.470
of satanic forces by which they could extract
all your blood.

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:41.310
I am so sorry when I hear that these things
have been happening all over.

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:47.460
But in the places where there has been the
seat of love, the Goddess Saraswati reigns,

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:56.260
where people educate themselves, all these
thing have come slowly and settled down.

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:59.330
There are other things also which are very
dangerous.

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:01.640
Like people who are, call themselves, psychologists.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.810
They can be very dangerous people.

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:05.120
They are unauthorized.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.169
They have no idea about the psyche.

00:21:07.169 --> 00:21:12.510
They don't know that psyche also has another
side, which is the right side, which is the

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:13.510
ego.

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:15.210
They can be very dangerously placed - person
like Freud.

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:17.929
I don't know how people believe in him.

00:21:17.929 --> 00:21:20.030
In England, there are so many Freudians.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:24.430
I am surprised because I used to think that
at least English are the wisest among all

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:26.510
the Europeans.

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:32.400
But more than the place where he was born
and worked out in Vienna, there are more in

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.400
England.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.880
It is most surprising, what has happened to
our wisdom.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.980
Even logically we can see that he was a hopeless
case.

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:45.230
First of all, he had bad relations with his
mother.

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:46.230
Can you imagine?

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:47.230
He had no sublimity of any kind.

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:48.230
He was worse than an animal.

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:52.880
And secondly that he died of cancer in such
a miserable condition.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.280
And he was nothing but a miserable personality.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:04.090
How can you follow a man like that blindfolded
because he suggested that you are a sex point.

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:05.630
All your relations are based on sex.

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:06.630
There is nothing sublime.

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:08.370
Now see where is the sex point.

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:13.710
It is the last - here there is the red - and
here resides the innocence.

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:19.919
This first center, which is the innocence
within us, is the child within us, is looking

00:22:19.919 --> 00:22:22.080
after the Mother Kundalini that you have.

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.850
She is your Mother.

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:27.790
Everybody has their own Mother settled down
in their sacrum bone, so sweetly, waiting

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:29.760
for an opportunity to get this realization.

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:35.350
She is going to give you your second birth
and she is going to work it out and this innocence

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:41.540
of yours which you may kill any amount, it's
still there and they attack that innocence.

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:46.400
Today I find in all the western countries
there is a big attack coming on their innocence,

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.480
on the children.

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:53.070
They do not understand that there is - sex
has nothing to do with your evolution.

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:55.220
It is not important for your evolution.

00:22:55.220 --> 00:23:00.910
Of course a married sex which is a sensible
sex, which has a sanction with the collective,

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:04.929
is very important, no doubt, for the society
and everything.

00:23:04.929 --> 00:23:08.669
But here if you play about with your sex,
it's a dangerous game.

00:23:08.669 --> 00:23:14.420
It gives you all kinds of diseases; it gives
you impotency, all sorts of other problems

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:21.660
and worst of all, insecurity in the whole
atmosphere especially for the children.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:22.660
This is what it is.

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:25.559
We have not been able to use our brains.

00:23:25.559 --> 00:23:26.580
Use your brains.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:29.190
God has given you brains, come to logical
conclusion.

00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:32.500
Like the Mayor yesterday asked me, "What do
you do with them?"

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:35.480
I said, "First I will bring them to logical
conclusion."

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:38.010
See what should we expect.

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:45.660
We have known that Christ has said that, it
is written, "Thou shall not commit adultery."

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:48.530
I say, "Thou shall not have adulterous eyes."

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:53.100
Are we Christians aware of these warnings?

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:57.490
Not to have adulterous eyes, just the opposite
we have.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:00.059
So that the eyes should be clean.

00:24:00.059 --> 00:24:04.230
There should be no lust in our eyes.

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:08.470
It is to be at that point, not at the eye
level, not at the brain level.

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:13.480
It is at that point and it should reside there.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:19.150
There is placed your innocence, because innocence
guards you against all wrong doings, all wrong

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:24.000
things that you do with your sex, and that's
how you get into troubles and you have problems.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:32.130
Yesterday we had people there, many people
came and as the radio fellow has told me that

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:34.640
you better talk about how you cure people.

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.660
They will be very much interested.

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:41.620
I told them all how it happens and we did
cure so many people there, of many problems

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:50.410
and so many things can be cured and if you
want , you can get My tape to know about them,

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:53.030
how it happens and what chakras give you this.

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:56.650
But in short I'll tell you how we develop
problems within ourselves.

00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:03.750
Now one thing I would say, that when I am
discussing this, human mind is so funny that

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:05.850
immediately they start reflecting upon themselves.

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:07.870
Firstly they will feel guilty.

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:09.900
"Oh, I have done this".

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:13.410
Immediately they will start thinking that,
"I have got cancer," or, "I have got leukemia,"

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:14.710
or "I have got that."

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:18.560
So if I tell you about the symptoms, it can
be very critical.

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:22.450
There is a very interesting book I read long
time back when I was a child, "Three Men in

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:23.450
a Boat."

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:25.220
I am sure all of you must have read it.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:26.570
It's a very interesting one.

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:35.200
In that a character of one gentleman who said
that never read Materia Medica, the book about

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.200
medicine.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:46.100
Once he read it and he thought he had every
disease, every disease except for housewife's

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:52.970
knee and the doctor was amazed when he told
he has this disease, he has that disease.

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:55.049
He said, "Why not a housewife's knee?"

00:25:55.049 --> 00:25:57.750
He said, "Because I am not a housewife."

00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:01.809
Otherwise he had practically every disease
and he wanted a medicine for that.

00:26:01.809 --> 00:26:06.070
doctor was - that time doctors were wiser
I think, he didn't want to take money out

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:13.570
of him - so he said, "All right, I have given
you the medicine but you have to take it when

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:14.570
you go away from here.

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:19.080
Go to your bedroom and then you can take this
medicine."

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:25.370
He went home and opened that and there was
nothing but a paper, and on the paper it was

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:29.809
written, "You are the greatest fool I have
ever come across.

00:26:29.809 --> 00:26:35.840
Never read Materia Medica again and you are
absolutely healthy."

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:41.120
So when you start telling them how the diseases
are caused, also people can start thinking,

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.210
"Oh, I must be having this trouble and that
trouble."

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:44.220
Nothing of the kind.

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.210
Please don't think like that.

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:51.600
I am just telling you because you should not
go into it again and it should not happen

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.490
to you in future, not in the past.

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:56.450
And those who have had problems also can be
cured.

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:57.450
It's not difficult.

00:26:57.450 --> 00:26:58.770
It can be cured.

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:01.919
When you get your enlightenment, you can cure
people.

00:27:01.919 --> 00:27:03.780
You can also cure.

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:05.169
It's not difficult.

00:27:05.169 --> 00:27:09.041
So, now we start from the imbalances that
we have.

00:27:09.041 --> 00:27:13.500
For example, a human being has another funny
habit - is to go to extremes.

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:21.210
If you tell him, now in the Newspapers or,
say, in the TV it appears that your legs should

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:28.010
be like this, the measurement of the legs
appear, or the measurement of the body appears,

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:34.080
all the ladies will try to be that, to become
like the form that is given.

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.080
But why?

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:40.340
It is, it might be some sort of an enterprise
that people are trying to sell something just

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:45.990
to make you thin or fat or whatever it is
and that's why they are publishing these things.

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:47.450
Why just you go into it headlong?

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:50.070
May not be required at all for you.

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:56.970
Now when they do it, they do it so much, so
much overdo it that they develop really the

00:27:56.970 --> 00:28:01.429
problems which never existed in them .They
were normal people and suddenly they become

00:28:01.429 --> 00:28:02.429
sick people.

00:28:02.429 --> 00:28:06.710
So in this way, we have so many extremes we
go to.

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:12.950
For example, we are people who are right-sided
and left-sided as you can see here, the people

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:19.250
who are emotionally very rich and who go to
the emotional extremes and the people who

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:23.950
are more mentally rich and who go to the mental
side more.

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:30.484
Those who have any desire and just work with
their desires and weep for it and they are

00:28:30.484 --> 00:28:35.980
the most unhappy and the most miserable people
- I couldn't get this and I couldn't get that

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.920
- they are the left-sided people.

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:40.840
The right-sided people are that "Why did he
get that?"

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.610
"I must also get it."

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:46.380
Such aggressive people are right-sided.

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:50.300
Now the people who are on the left hand side
think of their past, "I was so very happy.

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:53.620
Now I have married this wretched man and I
am very weak."

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:58.110
The man will say, "I have married this wretched
woman," or some sort of a thing.

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:01.600
They go on worrying about themselves for nothing
at all and making themselves miserable.

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.420
So, we have two types of people.

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:06.480
The another, one extreme case we can say,
is Hitler.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.140
Hitler was the one who was so aggressive.

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:09.570
He used his aggressive policies.

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:17.800
He got people who were dead who were aggressive
and used them to entice, to become aggressive.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:18.800
They could not see through.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:23.990
They could not understand that they are not
a special race and they became such racists

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:28.740
which one can't understand with Human understanding
that how can there be a race superiority when

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.720
God has created all of us.

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:31.720
It's nonsense.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:32.720
It's absolute nonsense.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.360
It has no meaning, no basis.

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.360
It's not natural.

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:39.480
God has created everybody separately in a
different way but this kind of a thing comes

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.480
into the mind.

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:45.920
Then you are identified with certain ideas
on the right hand side that you are an aggressive

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.920
person.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:49.780
On the left hand side, as I told you, a person
makes himself miserable because he thinks

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:55.010
of the past, but on the right hand side, the
people make others miserable and aggressive

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:56.010
sort of.

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:57.179
Both sides are wrong.

00:29:57.179 --> 00:30:01.150
You have to be in the center, neither in the
future, nor in the past.

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:03.299
So how to be in the center is the problem.

00:30:03.299 --> 00:30:05.410
By saying it or by brain-washing it, it cannot
happen.

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:09.280
For that the Kundalini has to rise but you
have to keep the balance.

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:12.620
You shouldn't go to the extreme of anything.

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:17.720
You should not become identified or clubbed
with something which is not normal.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:21.220
We should treat it with normalcy about it.

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:28.300
Like if you ask a person now, "You have to
do Hatha Yoga" There is a new system that

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:31.919
has started, Hatha Yoga, without knowing what
this Hatha Yoga is.

00:30:31.919 --> 00:30:32.919
What was the basis of Hatha Yoga?

00:30:32.919 --> 00:30:35.790
There are Ashtangas and all these things have
to be done.

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:40.850
I have seen people doing only that little
part of it, the Vayayama, which is so indiscriminate,

00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:44.260
which has no sense as to what chakras are
catching, where is the Kundalini, what is

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:45.260
the problem.

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:51.030
Such people can develop heart problems, tremendous
heart problems they can develop, and they

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:56.990
can be extremely negative people because though
they appear to be very positive, they can

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:58.240
be very, very dry.

00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.289
They can develop divorces.

00:30:59.289 --> 00:31:01.039
They can be very aggressive.

00:31:01.039 --> 00:31:04.559
A time will come when they will have no emotions.

00:31:04.559 --> 00:31:06.970
Even when their own child dies, they will
not feel it.

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:09.260
They can be very, very dry.

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:12.330
Now we don't see that dryness in the back.

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:16.250
We do not see that that we are not feeling
the emotions of another person.

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:21.780
We do not think that that is important.

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:24.270
Left-sided people are the other way round,
as I told you.

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:29.230
But when they go to the extreme, first they
go into their subconscious.

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:33.279
In this they see what had happened and they
think of their previous lives and all that

00:31:33.279 --> 00:31:37.480
and then they can go into the collective sub-conscious
if they go on pressing it too much.

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:41.370
Or some of the people who are interested in
their purse, all such base things, can entice

00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:47.080
them, can hypnotize them, completely hypnotize
them and push them on to the left side.

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:51.200
Now cancer develops on the left side.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:54.460
Leukemia develops from the left side.

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:56.140
Multiple sclerosis develops from the left
side.

00:31:56.140 --> 00:32:02.990
I haven't seen one patient who has come to
me, who is having cancer, having leukemia

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:08.559
or multiple sclerosis who is a right-sided
person.

00:32:08.559 --> 00:32:16.159
And ultimately they can be epileptic, or they
can become lunatic or schizophrenic.

00:32:16.159 --> 00:32:18.320
All those things can happen to them.

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:23.100
The right-sided person, on the contrary, will
get a heart attack.

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:24.710
He'll get a heart attack.

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:28.330
Definitely he'll get a heart attack, if he
goes too much with it.

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:32.500
But first of all he might develop a liver,
very bad liver, hot temper with it.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:36.309
He may develop a pancreas trouble that could
be the diabetes.

00:32:36.309 --> 00:32:42.210
He could develop the spleen trouble which
could be a kind of a leukemia which comes

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:50.110
out of speediness but it has to triggered
by the left side so it is between the - first

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:55.550
the anemia and all that will happen and ultimately
he can get leukemia after that.

00:32:55.550 --> 00:33:01.730
And many children also become patients of
leukemia because their parents are speedy.

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:08.820
Extremely speedy people get leukemia because
they are all the time acting on emergency.

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:12.510
Simultaneously, they are working on various
things like, you are driving, you are eating,

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:15.230
you are listening to the radio - horrid news.

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:20.179
Early in the morning you see in the newspaper,
all horrid thing are there.

00:33:20.179 --> 00:33:21.790
They will never give a good news.

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:22.790
You'll be amazed.

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:26.250
We have been trying to tell people that we
have found out solutions to many things - please

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:30.929
publish at least one line, half a line - but
they would not.

00:33:30.929 --> 00:33:34.750
But if there is a calamity somewhere, a horrible
thing happened, early in the morning, you

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:37.799
open the newspaper, it's the only thing that
is talked of.

00:33:37.799 --> 00:33:40.800
You become so much upset that emergencies
that...

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:45.190
Then you have your breakfast, you have to
catch the train, you have to rush up, you

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:48.790
rush up, then you find that your train is
delayed, you start shouting.

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:50.460
Specially you all get worked up.

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:54.220
Ultimately what happens is that your spleen
goes out of gear.

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:55.220
It becomes crazy.

00:33:55.220 --> 00:34:00.330
When it becomes crazy - it's a speedometer
- it controls our speed and you become so

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:06.930
speedy that nothing can fit into you and the
speed of the production of red blood corpuscles

00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:09.200
is so much increased that they become malignant.

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:13.919
But of course the triggering, as I said, comes
from the left side.

00:34:13.919 --> 00:34:24.050
So sometimes the right side can create a condition
for the left side to act - can also be just

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:25.790
the left side can work out.

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:35.280
If a person is affected, say, by a position,
if he lives near a funeral place or some place

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:42.750
where there is a cemetery or in the churches
also you have all the dead bodies there - I

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:44.180
mean it's something I can't understand.

00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:45.669
People don't know about that.

00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:49.270
Why to put in the churches, the dead bodies?

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:55.060
I mean, normally, anybody who dies must be
cremated except for the realized souls.

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:57.310
Realized souls are to be buried.

00:34:57.310 --> 00:35:01.590
It's a simple thing, because they give fragrance
to the Mother Earth, they give fragrance to

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:02.590
everyone.

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:07.440
But if you bury a person who is not a realized
soul - supposing he is an evil genius - you

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.099
know about this that the souls wander about.

00:35:10.099 --> 00:35:14.359
And I have lived, since I have come to London,
always near a church.

00:35:14.359 --> 00:35:19.020
I have found all these souls coming up in
the night and they are horrible things and

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:20.020
we walk over them.

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:22.030
They are sleeping there and we trod on them.

00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:23.360
It's a wrong thing.

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:28.250
People have no idea as to how to deal with
the dead and that's how people have also created

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:29.300
a double problem.

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:34.000
The cemetery is in the city.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.080
The center of the city, there will be a cemetery.

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.200
All children are going there.

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:39.200
Everybody is going there.

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.510
Pregnant women are going there and these busy
bodies can attack you.

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:42.510
It's a fact.

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:43.510
They exist.

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:44.510
There is no doubt about it.

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:51.280
Even the doctors say that there are proteins
which they call as Protein 52 and Protein

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:57.080
58, like that, and these are the proteins
which invade us, our being by which cancer

00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:58.080
is triggered.

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:02.510
And what they say that this comes to us from
an area which is built within us since our

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:04.290
creation, means from collective sub-conscious.

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:08.940
But, I mean, they cannot put it together as
I am putting it because they see things from

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:10.830
outside (and) I see things from inside.

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:15.600
Now when I tell about this, people don't like
it but it's a fact.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.800
You should not play about with spirits.

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:21.040
These spiritualists, these charismatics and
this sect and that sect..., Penticostals are

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:26.570
nothing but possessions and these possessions
can be horrible and most of the lunatics and

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:30.060
all these people are with possessions.

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:31.840
You must have seen a woman walking.

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:32.960
Suddenly she becomes blank.

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:35.200
Her eyes are open, nothing wrong with her.

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.200
Doctors can't cure.

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:40.640
She can be easily cured if you can remove
the possession from her.

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:47.400
These are all horrible things, which can ruin
your life and you do not understand why doctors

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:50.400
cannot understand because they don't understand
that there can be spirits.

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.720
They don't want to accept it.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:56.470
You can't see the spirit until and unless
you become a Spirit.

00:36:56.470 --> 00:37:02.610
That is the problem, is that in English language
there are three meanings of the word spirit.

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:05.390
One is the Spirit that is Atma.

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:12.310
Another is the spirit which is dead and the
one that you drink is also spirit.

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:16.050
So you can understand how can you have three
words, which are just opposite each other

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:17.050
meaning the same?

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:24.589
Now I am praying (to) the Spirit which is
in the heart, which is the reflection of God

00:37:24.589 --> 00:37:25.750
almighty.

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:32.570
But this Spirit, unless and until it is awakened,
no use talking about it.

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:39.500
Better have it done so that you know how beautiful
you are, how God has created you with such

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.690
beauty, care, and you are all there intact.

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:42.690
Nothing is missing.

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:43.920
You don't have to worry about it.

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:46.030
You just don't have to think about it.

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:47.660
"Oh, Mother, how can I be?

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:49.220
I have done this.

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.220
I have done that."

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:51.220
Please don't think.

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:53.710
First thing that I always say before starting
the program, before the demonstration of it

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:58.170
or before the manifestation of it, that first
of all say in your heart of hearts, "Mother,

00:37:58.170 --> 00:37:59.690
I am not guilty."

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:05.109
That's one thing, this idea that you are guilty,
is absurd.

00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:06.910
It has no meaning at all.

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:11.830
It is not even a speck in that Ocean which
cleanses you.

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:14.160
So you don't have to say that - that, "I am
guilty."

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:18.849
Please, for heaven's sake, all of you have
to say that in your hearts before we start

00:38:18.849 --> 00:38:20.180
any program further.

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:23.960
Because how can you be guilty?

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:30.130
As He is the compassion - you can't imagine
what compassion He has.

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:32.440
He is forgiving.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:35.530
He is complete forgiveness.

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:40.570
At that time if you have to feel guilty, you
really insult His power of forgiveness.

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:44.430
So we should not feel guilty about anything.

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:45.440
Whatever has happened has happened.

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:46.440
Forget the past, doesn't matter.

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:50.670
It is a very important time, important moment
you have arrived.

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:52.859
The time of resurrection has come.

00:38:52.859 --> 00:38:54.660
The time of blossom has come.

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.010
You have to become the truth.

00:38:56.010 --> 00:39:00.430
It has to work out and it will work out.

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:02.650
May God bless you all.

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:06.520
I would request you, if you have any questions,
you can ask me questions.

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:10.790
But don't ask irrelevant questions and, you
see, offensive questions.

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:16.490
That's very wrong because, you see, I have
nothing to get out of you - nothing I tell

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:21.310
you - except that little politics about it
that I am a Capitalist in the sense that I

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:26.300
have all the powers within myself and I am
a Communist because I can't live without sharing

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:27.300
it.

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:31.599
That's the problem and that's why I am here
and so people should not ask questions which

00:39:31.599 --> 00:39:34.070
are offensive for nothing at all.

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:35.750
If you want to get it, you can get it.

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:39.030
I cannot force you as I have told you in the
very beginning.

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:40.540
It cannot be forced.

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:41.810
I cannot promise you.

00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:47.650
I am sure it will work out, if you little
bit co-operate with me.

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:49.900
So be kind to yourself and be open.

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:55.370
You need not have blind faith about me, not
at all, not at all, but you should be open

00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:56.370
to receive.

00:39:56.370 --> 00:39:57.370
If it works, well and good.

00:39:57.370 --> 00:40:00.110
If it doesn't work we'll see it the next time,
doesn't matter.

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:07.109
I am going to be in London at least for three
years more.

00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:11.420
I hope so.

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:18.599
May God bless you all.

00:40:18.599 --> 00:40:27.220
Now please ask me some questions.

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:32.410
Q. When you say that spiritualists ....spirits
are wrong..is it wrong for someone who knows

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:47.300
the secret to try and do something about it
....what is so wrong with it?

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:55.079
Shri Mataji: You see the spirits are the dead
spirits, are the people who belong to another

00:40:55.079 --> 00:40:56.079
country.

00:40:56.079 --> 00:40:57.670
They belong to another state.

00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:58.670
All right?

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:01.119
They are in the subconscious area.

00:41:01.119 --> 00:41:05.390
If you start allowing them to walk into our
lives, there will be many who will come around

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:06.770
as immigrants, you see.

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:12.630
And you don't know what they are up to and
they will attack you.

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:18.890
Moreover, those people who are realized souls
or of higher nature never stay back.

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:22.970
They know that this is over and we should
go back.

00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:27.650
Moreover, it is our responsibility also to
see that we do not trouble them.

00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:30.730
I mean, we have used them; they have lived
with us.

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:32.730
Now we should give them their freedom.

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:35.700
By keeping them around, we torture them.

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:37.050
We trouble them.

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:40.030
And sometimes they can be very, very troubled.

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:42.700
Even if they are good people, we really trouble
them.

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:43.700
Let them go.

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:48.820
That's not the time that they should be here
and they will be back again.

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:49.820
Why trouble them?

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:52.180
It is because you are identified with them.

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:56.930
Now about sickness, people say that for sickness,
I have known people who are spiritualists,

00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:57.930
who try to cure.

00:41:57.930 --> 00:42:01.750
But what they do is to remove one spirit and
put another one into it.

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:08.190
If a person, say, he is a person who is wasting
money, say in horse riding, so if you remove

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:10.330
him from there, he'll become an alcoholic.

00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:12.480
If not, he'll start beating his wife.

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.420
Because there is no transformation, you see.

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:19.619
There is a gap always if you ....so it is
better not to have some sort of a screw there

00:42:19.619 --> 00:42:22.670
which is always to be replaced by something
else.

00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:28.180
So these spiritualists, also those who try
to heal, are just giving you relief in the

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:29.180
physical being.

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:30.180
Physical being is not so important.

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:32.830
It is part of it but we are not only physical
beings.

00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:35.570
We are also mental beings and emotional beings.

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:40.730
If you try to be only physical being, do everything
only for the physical side, then you forget

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:41.730
the spirit.

00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:43.870
And the spirits get angry with you.

00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:49.119
So you are three of these things which are
to be integrated through your spiritual ascent.

00:42:49.119 --> 00:42:50.119
All right?

00:42:50.119 --> 00:42:57.700
So that's why in any case that kind of a work
is of no help in any way to ask because ultimately

00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:02.550
we have to see to the general good of everyone
.

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:07.310
I have seen spiritualists who have been acting
as spiritualist end up their lives very miserably,

00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:09.130
most of them.

00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:14.920
Not only that but whenever they are in a program
you get tremendous heat from them.

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:16.880
All those people who have tried such tricks...

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:20.010
I'll give you a very good example of Doctor
[unclear: Lang or Land Side B 11:35], who

00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:23.920
was, who died - late Doctor [Unclear: Land
or Lang] International Curative Centre was

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:26.730
in London, I don't know if it is still existing
or not.

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:31.500
I came to know about it because so many people
in India suffered from that curative center.

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:32.670
And they came to me.

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:33.670
I had no idea.

00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:38.590
Now this gentleman died long time back and
his spirit entered into a soldier, not into

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:40.780
his son, but to a soldier in Vietnam or something.

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:45.960
And this soldier, now they write all this
story, I mean they are very frank and honest

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.890
- I must say they are not hiding anything.

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:53.640
So this gentleman came to England and told
the son that I am the father and he told him

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:57.329
secrets where things are and all that and
he convinced him that he was the father.

00:43:57.329 --> 00:44:02.750
He said that you open a clinic with this name
- Late Doctor [Unclear: Land or Lang] International

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:03.750
Curative Centre.

00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:11.060
Now what they used to do, you see, he got
hold of many doctors who were sort of unhappy

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:14.210
or some sort of thing or those who were lingering
behind.

00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:19.680
So, he used those spirits and what he did
by using those spirits, he used to write a

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:24.859
letter, which I have seen myself, in many
cases, that at this time, at this hour, we

00:44:24.859 --> 00:44:26.270
will enter into your body.

00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:27.680
I mean, they frankly told.

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:32.480
They didn't say that "We are going to do anything
divine, and we'll enter into your body and

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:36.270
when we enter into your body, then what will
happen, that you'll start shaking.

00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:37.270
Don't be worried.

00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:41.530
It is we who are in you, and once it happens,"
- it would happen after three months or four

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:45.369
months but they would give exact timing - "and
then you'll feel better."

00:44:45.369 --> 00:44:49.220
Now these people who came to me suffered from
tremendous nervous trouble.

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:54.720
And out of all these who came, even one percent
I could not cure - one percent.

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:56.710
They were such gone cases.

00:44:56.710 --> 00:45:02.260
They had a miserable old age and I still know
of a lady; she just lays down in her bed and

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:06.329
goes into tremors and things and nobody can
help her.

00:45:06.329 --> 00:45:10.160
I haven't got time to pay so much attention
to one individual only.

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:11.930
So it's a miserable case.

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:15.380
Every time I go there, she meets me.

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:16.540
I put her right.

00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:20.040
Again she goes back to her bed (and) again
she gets ill.

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:24.690
It's a very long process.

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:29.130
I am not here to cure you, I must tell you
very frankly, but to give you realization.

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:32.130
But as a by-product of that, you all get cured.

00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:33.130
That's it.

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:35.542
Just as a by- product of that, you get cured.

00:45:35.542 --> 00:45:39.000
Moreover, you must understand that God is
the source of all common sense.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.290
He will only cure such lamps which will be
His lights later on because we don't look

00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:46.660
after lamps which are gone cases.

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:47.980
So they can be born again.

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:54.000
But God looks after those people who can give
His light to all.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.630
Of course, many people get cured.

00:45:55.630 --> 00:46:00.110
I have seen in London, the first wave of Sahaja
Yoga started - we have thousands of them they

00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:01.110
got cured.

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:05.230
But out of them very few really took up Sahaja
Yoga and helped others.

00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:06.230
They just forgot.

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:07.660
Of course, they have tremendous respect for
Me.

00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:10.609
When I go to India; they all fill the hall
and all that is there.

00:46:10.609 --> 00:46:11.890
But they are doing nothing for Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:15.060
They are not doing anything curing for others.

00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:16.470
They are not raising their Kundalini.

00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:18.369
They are not giving realization.

00:46:18.369 --> 00:46:24.020
It's really... sometimes I feel that so many
people have been cured, so much God has done

00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:28.609
for them, but they don't understand why God
has done it for them . It is to give it to

00:46:28.609 --> 00:46:29.609
others.

00:46:29.609 --> 00:46:30.609
You don't have to do so much for Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:30.609 --> 00:46:31.880
You don't have to pay a single pi [short form
of Paise].

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:33.010
Nothing is needed.

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:35.050
Only thing is, God has given you this power.

00:46:35.050 --> 00:46:36.530
All right, just give it to others.

00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:37.530
That's all.

00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:38.530
It's very simple.

00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:40.369
And you feel so happy.

00:46:40.369 --> 00:46:44.390
You are so employed by God that you do not
feel bored at all.

00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:45.640
It's such a wonderful thing.

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:49.910
But one must accept that if He has been kind
to us we have to be kind to others.

00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:53.690
It will just automatically work, no doubt.

00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:54.770
It works.

00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:58.339
I know people get cured, no doubt about it.

00:46:58.339 --> 00:46:59.880
Any other question please?

00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:02.960
Yes, please - little loudly....can you say
loudly, please?

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:12.670
Q. Why is the picture sitting on the table
lying next to you?

00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:17.140
Shri Mataji: Why?

00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:20.330
You don't like it?

00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:29.460
It's a question really something I can't understand.

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:36.030
You see, if I am something, if this picture
is My true picture, then why not have it?

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:38.412
All the pictures you have of Christ are not
His own.

00:47:38.412 --> 00:47:45.460
Very few people have seen Him and also there
is no one who has taken His picture.

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:48.310
Actually, when I see the pictures of Christ
I get a shock.

00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:50.089
I said, "How can this be Christ?"

00:47:50.089 --> 00:47:54.930
I mean, this miserable creature cannot be
Christ at all, but you don't mind having all

00:47:54.930 --> 00:47:55.940
these things around.

00:47:55.940 --> 00:48:01.910
Even the cross that you have can be horrible,
made of plastic, made of this, made of that.

00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:04.570
That gives horrible vibrations to you.

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:06.359
You don't know anything about it.

00:48:06.359 --> 00:48:12.790
With this picture, you'll be surprised, the
person who first got realization got through

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:13.790
this picture.

00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:15.680
In this picture there are vibrations.

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:19.530
When you will get realized, you will know
that only this picture has that vibration

00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:23.839
because the real thing it is - thank God that
science has given us the real thing.

00:48:23.839 --> 00:48:29.500
If there were cameras before, we would have
had pictures of all those great people.

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:32.130
Because there were no photographs they said,
"Better not have any pictures."

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:37.640
Because all the pictures were imaginary, done
by people who wanted to have some money.

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:42.650
With this picture, many people have been cured.

00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:44.790
All right?

00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:47.130
Especially in Australia, a miracle happened.

00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:49.460
That's how media took me over.

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:57.220
There was a lady, a friend of a very big journalist
and a businessman there who was in coma and

00:48:57.220 --> 00:49:04.220
doctors said she has got a brain trouble and
she cannot come back to her normal condition.

00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:08.420
There is a damage in her brain and she is
dying.

00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:11.960
Then everybody had given up hopes and there
was one Sahaja Yogini and she said, "All right,

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:14.630
you just allow me to put this photograph under
her pillow."

00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:17.190
And you'll be surprised: she came to consciousness
next day.

00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:19.890
By the time I reached there, she was very
conscious.

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:22.940
So all the media was there to receive me in
Australia.

00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:27.520
I was surprised because media is the last
which attends to anything that is real.

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:31.550
I was Myself aghast to see them there.

00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:35.690
But it's one thing, no doubt, and it's really
true and it happened and now that woman is

00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:36.690
walking about.

00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:38.830
You can write to her and find out.

00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:42.480
So this is what it is.

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:46.890
It's a very good thing that has happened that
we can take pictures now because I think,

00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:55.850
I cannot meet everyone in this world but they
can at least see my picture.

00:49:55.850 --> 00:49:57.860
People get cured by this picture.

00:49:57.860 --> 00:49:58.860
What's wrong?

00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:01.640
Supposing your picture was like that, I would
like to put it there.

00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:03.609
But is it like that?

00:50:03.609 --> 00:50:04.609
That's the point.

00:50:04.609 --> 00:50:06.280
You see some people say, "Why you are doing
it?"

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:07.470
I say, "Better you do it.

00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:08.660
I would like to retire."

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:10.800
Actually, today my husband was very angry
with me.

00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:12.700
He said, "Why are you there on Saturdays?

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:13.700
Why don't you come?"

00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:16.120
I said, "Now it has been advertised too much.

00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:17.490
I just can't come."

00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:20.980
He is not, he wants me there for some purpose
and he was not very happy about it.

00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:24.320
So I would be very happy if you could sit
down here and do the job.

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:25.320
You see, I'll be very happy.

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:26.320
I'll retire.

00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:27.320
But you can't do it.

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:30.630
And why to feel bad if I can do it?

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:33.160
Because you can do many more things that I
cannot.

00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:38.510
For example, I can't drive, I don't know how
to write a check, I don't know anything that

00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:39.510
you know.

00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:40.820
So many things there are that I do not know.

00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:41.820
You'll be amazed.

00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:46.880
I am so simple that people can call me a rustic
woman because I don't know many things that

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:48.040
you know.

00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:52.950
But I know one thing: that is awakening of
your Kundalini, and then another thing is

00:50:52.950 --> 00:51:06.339
that this photograph also knows you somehow.

00:51:06.339 --> 00:51:11.339
Yes please?

00:51:11.339 --> 00:51:22.520
Q; How did you discover such a quick way of
self realization?

00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:27.330
Shri Mataji: Must be something about Me, sir.

00:51:27.330 --> 00:51:28.970
You better find out.

00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:29.970
It's true.

00:51:29.970 --> 00:51:30.970
It's true.

00:51:30.970 --> 00:51:33.109
But something about Me, definitely.

00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:36.880
You see, whatever our education is, you have
come to us with wisdom and all that, it has

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:40.580
come to us through other English writers and
western writers.

00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:47.109
But if you really go into the literature,
you will know that it is already prophesized.

00:51:47.109 --> 00:51:50.590
Even William Blake has prophesized absolutely
about Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:50.590 --> 00:51:56.020
He said that God of men [men of god?] will
become prophets and they will have powers

00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:58.300
to make others prophets.

00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:00.580
But who reads Blake?

00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:02.860
No one;they read Freud.

00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:09.079
He's described to such a detail about Sahaja
Yoga that sometimes I am amazed.

00:52:09.079 --> 00:52:13.840
No Indian seer has seen that what William
Blake has seen.

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:21.250
But our mentality is funny because once he
had his exhibition; I went to see his exhibition

00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:23.920
and people were looking at nude women that
he had painted.

00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:24.920
He was innocent.

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:29.810
He didn't paint any nudity; he just painted
women without any dress, just the body.

00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:32.470
But they were looking at the nude women.

00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:34.369
So, look at our mentality.

00:52:34.369 --> 00:52:42.020
Looking at William Blake also we praise him
because he has painted women without dress.

00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:43.550
He was innocent.

00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:44.550
It has to be done.

00:52:44.550 --> 00:52:46.660
The time has come.

00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:51.609
At the beginning of life, I know there were
hardly one or two people, but today is the

00:52:51.609 --> 00:52:56.000
time, a time where many have to become.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:00.800
As you know, on the tree of life there were
few flowers.

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:06.980
Now there has to be many flowers because the
blossom time has come and it has to be simple.

00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:11.839
But supposing it is simple, must you not accept?

00:53:11.839 --> 00:53:15.599
It's like my grandmother saying, "I don't
believe you can go to moon.

00:53:15.599 --> 00:53:17.940
How can it be possible?"

00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:19.339
It's like that.

00:53:19.339 --> 00:53:21.220
It's a jet age.

00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:24.800
If there is speed outside, if the tree is
growing outside too much, something must have

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:27.869
grown inside: the roots.

00:53:27.869 --> 00:53:32.369
And this is the knowledge of the roots which
you do not know, which you should know, how

00:53:32.369 --> 00:53:36.210
it has grown, what it is sucking.

00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:37.310
All right?

00:53:37.310 --> 00:53:39.130
If it is so, why not have it?

00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:42.380
I mean, if I say there's a diamond, will you
refuse it?

00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:45.089
You'll say, "All right, if it's diamond then
let us see."

00:53:45.089 --> 00:53:52.230
It's more than all the diamonds put together.

00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:54.420
It's true.

00:53:54.420 --> 00:54:03.430
It is very simple to understand if you see
God's point of view.

00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:06.680
This creation has to have a meaning.

00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:08.060
And you are going to give it the meaning.

00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:12.730
If it doesn't work out, this creation, it
is going to destroy, because human beings

00:54:12.730 --> 00:54:16.230
are going to be destroyed.

00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:17.910
You can see that.

00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:26.550
You can see around what is the situation is.

00:54:26.550 --> 00:55:14.630
Q: [Unclear Side B 22:57]
Shri Mataji: It's a little confused question

00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:21.950
because, you see... but I understand what
you are trying to say, that people are seeing

00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:25.130
it through now because they are intelligent.

00:55:25.130 --> 00:55:28.349
They are seeing through and it has reached
a certain culminating point, you see.

00:55:28.349 --> 00:55:34.319
All these philosophies have reached certain
culminating point and they are seeing that,

00:55:34.319 --> 00:55:35.319
what is the result.

00:55:35.319 --> 00:55:39.140
Now the time has come for them to see the
result of all their mental projections we

00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:40.750
have had about everything.

00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:43.839
So people are thinking that there must be
an answer to all this.

00:55:43.839 --> 00:55:48.150
Whatever we have done may have been little
wrong or something has been more linear.

00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:52.800
It is not expanding us and it is not giving
us what was promised to us.

00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:56.380
So they are thinking about it and they are
going down to find out the answers.

00:55:56.380 --> 00:55:58.160
That's why there is a seeking, no doubt.

00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:04.230
But it is also the plan that they should be
here, that they should be on this earth at

00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:05.230
this time.

00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:06.339
All, so many things have worked out.

00:56:06.339 --> 00:56:09.650
But the reason is that there is confusion
today.

00:56:09.650 --> 00:56:12.150
In this confusion only, you are going to find
it out.

00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:16.849
If you were not confused, if you were sure
that you are doing the right thing and you

00:56:16.849 --> 00:56:21.240
have done whatever is right which was before
this, then you would not have thought of it.

00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:26.800
But just now people are seeing that we are
relatively living: "This is also right.

00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:27.800
This is also right."

00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:28.800
How can that be?

00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:29.800
If right is one then it should be one.

00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.460
So people are thinking about it.

00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:32.460
They are seeking.

00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:34.170
In this seeking they might do mistakes.

00:56:34.170 --> 00:56:40.470
And people might do many mistakes like going
to wrong gurus, might spend money for it,

00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:44.619
may become bankrupts, might go to drugs, might
do this punk rock... all kinds of things.

00:56:44.619 --> 00:56:51.599
They are nothing but expression of that feeling
within that there is something beyond.

00:56:51.599 --> 00:56:56.230
It's true that this confusion has led to this
seeking.

00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:57.760
No doubt about it.

00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:59.000
Because they are all challenged.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.000
These philosophies are challenged.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.000
Everything is challenged.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:04.210
And people see that it has given no result.

00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:06.300
Our forefathers did the same; we are doing
the same.

00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:07.349
What's the use?

00:57:07.349 --> 00:57:09.359
We have to reach somewhere.

00:57:09.359 --> 00:57:15.400
For example, Jung has talked of universal
unconsciousness much before I came.

00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:19.839
They have prepared the stage for Sahaja Yoga,
I should say.

00:57:19.839 --> 00:57:22.339
All right?

00:57:22.339 --> 00:57:29.829
Q: [Unclear : something about another guru...

00:57:29.829 --> 00:57:33.569
Side B 25:51].

00:57:33.569 --> 00:57:39.790
Shri Mataji: Oh, now don't ask about them.

00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:41.980
What do you think about him?

00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:44.240
What have they done?

00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:49.380
What good have they done to you?

00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:57.130
In general, there is one principle you must
apply to all of them.

00:57:57.130 --> 00:58:03.670
On the gross, anybody who is interested in
your money is not your guru; he is a parasite,

00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:04.809
on the gross.

00:58:04.809 --> 00:58:14.530
In the subtle, anybody who doesn't manifest
your powers has no powers of his own.

00:58:14.530 --> 00:58:17.369
These two you apply to every guru and don't
ask Me individual question.

00:58:17.369 --> 00:58:35.220
The one who is interested in Rolls Royce,
I mean if you think him to be a guru, I must

00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:38.431
say this is something surprising.

00:58:38.431 --> 00:58:39.431
Very surprising.

Shri Mataji:.

00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:32.200
It's again confused, my child, but doesn't
matter.

00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:33.940
Let's see now...they had a hot air on their
head.

00:59:33.940 --> 00:59:35.270
Did you say so?

00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:36.430
When was it?

00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:38.030
Where was it written?

00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:41.609
You saw it in pictures?

00:59:41.609 --> 00:59:44.480
Reply : In the scriptures.

00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:48.059
[unclear: Pentecost Side B 27:53].

00:59:48.059 --> 00:59:52.099
He sent out twelve men to do his work.

00:59:52.099 --> 00:59:53.099
Shri Mataji: Yes, it's all right.

00:59:53.099 --> 00:59:54.099
Now, I'll tell you what.

00:59:54.099 --> 00:59:55.099
You see, hot air will come out of everybody's
head now.

00:59:55.099 --> 00:59:56.099
Even you are sitting here.

00:59:56.099 --> 00:59:57.140
Because there is heat within you.

00:59:57.140 --> 01:00:00.240
First the hot air will come out.

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:04.829
You see, Christ tried to give them realization
but they didn't believe Him.

01:00:04.829 --> 01:00:08.080
Believe me that they never believed Him till
he got His resurrection.

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:10.339
No, till they got His resurrection you see.

01:00:10.339 --> 01:00:17.030
Till He got his resurrection, they were still
like this you see, little half baked, not

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:18.030
fully there.

01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:19.950
And that's why the hot air came out .

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:25.130
You will see now, gradually as you'll settle
down in Sahaja Yoga, when you will be fully

01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:28.210
equipped, when your vibrations will flow well,
it will be cool breeze.

01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:30.070
Otherwise, hot air comes out.

01:00:30.070 --> 01:00:34.020
You see, with people who have... most of you
will first have hot air, no doubt about it

01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:35.369
because there is heat within you.

01:00:35.369 --> 01:00:42.059
Now, I will tell you people very frankly about
it that when it is hot, say for example take

01:00:42.059 --> 01:00:45.270
Helium, Helium is a gas - you know that.

01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:51.320
When it is hot, all the molecules in it fight
within, revolt against each other.

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:52.620
They are absolutely volatile.

01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:57.509
But when it cools down, they become collective
and they move in a collective way.

01:00:57.509 --> 01:01:00.859
Even in science it has been shown and it is
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost which has

01:01:00.859 --> 01:01:02.400
been described in the Bible also.

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:08.750
So it should be a cool breeze because even
the Apostles that Christ had, they did not

01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:10.630
get their realization fully because they were
doubting Him.

01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:15.690
Not doubting, I would say they did not have
that faith till they saw He was resurrected.

01:01:15.690 --> 01:01:20.450
And after resurrection to have faith was rather
wrong, isn't it?

01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:23.480
Untimely, I should say.

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:26.510
I can understand that.

01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:28.869
That time, you see, this was not there.

01:01:28.869 --> 01:01:33.559
I mean, to talk of realization itself in that
country was something so out of the blue.

01:01:33.559 --> 01:01:38.770
They were fishermen, not Cambridge students,
and you could not explain to them.

01:01:38.770 --> 01:01:42.950
But still they were simple people and they
were honest, no doubt about it.

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:45.230
But to their honesty, they could not understand
how...

01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:49.380
what this man is saying about self-realization
or of second birth, you see.

01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:51.380
And so they doubted - was all right at that
time.

01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:57.809
But today it is not all right because once
you get realization, you see for yourself.

01:01:57.809 --> 01:01:58.809
All right?

01:01:58.809 --> 01:02:06.030
Q: [Unclear: also had this experience after
the resurrection Side B 30:10]

01:02:06.030 --> 01:02:09.660
Shri Mataji: You see, they had faith with
Him.

01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:14.830
But I wouldn't say they got realization, except
for John, I would say; but others, I am not

01:02:14.830 --> 01:02:15.830
very sure.

01:02:15.830 --> 01:02:20.869
Because the way they write about His works,
it's something an outsider writes, you see.

01:02:20.869 --> 01:02:23.850
It's just a ... not a person who is innate.

01:02:23.850 --> 01:02:25.960
You see, when they write, that's not there,
I find.

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:29.080
But the worst of all I feel is about St. Paul
who should not be there at all.

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:30.790
He had nothing to do with Christ.

01:02:30.790 --> 01:02:34.510
I can't understand why he is there because
according to Sahaja Yoga standard, he was

01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:36.220
a supra-conscious personality.

01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:39.319
I don't know why he put them there because
he saw a cross or he did all this.

01:02:39.319 --> 01:02:43.470
He was the one who was killing all the Christians
to begin with and then suddenly, I don't know

01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:47.760
how - it was a Roman trick perhaps to put
him there - I don't know why but somehow I

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:49.250
cannot explain it.

[Interruption by an audience - UNCLEAR Side

right?

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:22.130

have you got?

Why discuss all these things?

01:03:56.590 --> 01:03:59.740
We have so many clergies here who have been
studying Bible and all that and they are now

01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:00.740
fed up.

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:01.740

Shri Mataji: Of course, that you will be in

01:04:17.319 --> 01:04:18.319
meditation.

01:04:18.319 --> 01:04:20.780
You cannot meditate; you get into meditation.

01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:22.490
That is the most meditative state.

01:04:22.490 --> 01:04:24.270
Now, so I will tell you what happens to you,
all right?

01:04:24.270 --> 01:04:25.270
Let me talk on that.

01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:29.650
That's a better question, a very good question.

01:04:29.650 --> 01:04:35.050
First when the Kundalini rises - all right?

01:04:35.050 --> 01:04:39.240
- you won't feel anything, most of you won't
feel anything, but some of you may feel.

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:42.380
You may feel heat in the body.

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:48.510
You may feel kind of a, some people might
feel the throbbing in the back in the spinal

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:51.299
cord, might feel, little, not much.

01:04:51.299 --> 01:04:53.670
It's not very painful or anything.

01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:54.780
Don't be frightened of anything.

01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:56.980
Then it will rise.

01:04:56.980 --> 01:05:01.109
Some of you might feel the rising, because
if there are obstructions you can feel the

01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:02.109
rising.

01:05:02.109 --> 01:05:05.839
If there isn't any obstruction, if you are
not misidentified, if you are not extremist,

01:05:05.839 --> 01:05:10.710
if you are in the center, normally it shoots
off in the split of a second.

01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:16.420
When it shoots off, what do you feel is, you
feel a cool breeze coming out of your head.

01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:20.809
But normally, as I have seen, people are complicated.

01:05:20.809 --> 01:05:23.770
There are complications in the physical, mental
or emotional being.

01:05:23.770 --> 01:05:25.330
People are not so balanced.

01:05:25.330 --> 01:05:28.490
Mostly they have liver problems or such things
like that.

01:05:28.490 --> 01:05:30.970
You might get heat coming out.

01:05:30.970 --> 01:05:33.960
First the heat comes; quite a lot of heat
might come.

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:38.810
When the heat disappears, then you start feeling
the cool coming and you feel very nice inside.

01:05:38.810 --> 01:05:40.930
Then the bliss starts coming.

01:05:40.930 --> 01:05:46.410
You start feeling absolutely relaxed and you
feel in your hands the cool breeze is coming.

01:05:46.410 --> 01:05:48.470
But first of all you feel on the head.

01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:50.349
You should feel yourself.

01:05:50.349 --> 01:05:51.869
Nobody is going to certify it for you.

01:05:51.869 --> 01:05:53.280
There is no falsehood about it.

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:56.310
It's a thing that you have to feel it.

01:05:56.310 --> 01:06:01.920
And once it happens to you then you can develop
it.

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:07.799
Because though the Kundalini at the first
shot comes out but then She tries to look

01:06:07.799 --> 01:06:14.319
after your different organs if they are sick,
your mind if it is overloaded, or anything

01:06:14.319 --> 01:06:18.569
that is wrong it creates a balance [unclear
Side B 34:42]...

01:06:18.569 --> 01:06:22.760
So you have to just know how to reestablish
it yourself because it is your own.

01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:23.890
Everything is your own.

01:06:23.890 --> 01:06:27.460
It's - you can think like this that this light
is your own.

01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:29.660
It is your own lamp.

01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:33.680
I just have come because I have got the flame
in Me, perhaps.

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:35.190
Then I put the lamp.

01:06:35.190 --> 01:06:36.790
Your light is enlightened.

01:06:36.790 --> 01:06:38.650
Now you look after your light.

01:06:38.650 --> 01:06:40.660
It's your light, it's everything yours.

01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:41.860
The power is yours.

01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:42.900
It's your mother.

01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:46.119
It's your own spirit.

01:06:46.119 --> 01:06:48.150
And then you work it out.

01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:56.510
Unless and until you work it out, you will
not know whether it is true or not.

01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:57.809
You have to work it out.

01:06:57.809 --> 01:07:02.250
Now you should not be identified with anything,
that's one thing is true; because you have

01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:03.869
not seen the reality so far.

01:07:03.869 --> 01:07:06.830
Say, for example, Mr X says, "This one says
so."

01:07:06.830 --> 01:07:10.090
All right, must have said it but he is not
here.

01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:13.330
Today he is not here; it is I who am sitting
here.

01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:14.330
All right?

01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:18.559
So it is better that what I am saying you
better receive it because it's nice to live

01:07:18.559 --> 01:07:19.559
with the past.

01:07:19.559 --> 01:07:24.910
Like, people want to believe in the past because
it is easy to handle the past, or live with

01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:28.320
the future because it is easy, or live with
somebody who has written a book or something

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:29.670
he had done to us.

01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:35.071
But why not believe in yourself that so far
you have not got anything of your own and

01:07:35.071 --> 01:07:39.069
I am saying that you have to get it of your
own.

01:07:39.069 --> 01:07:43.859
That's the main point I am trying to say,
that you must not believe into anything till

01:07:43.859 --> 01:07:46.130
you have found it yourself within your self.

01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:47.380
That's what it is.

01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:51.990
And if you are identified with other things
which you have been doing - most of the people

01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:55.810
who have paid to some Guru or some thing,
get very much identified with them.

01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:57.240
But what have they given you?

01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:58.619
Have they given you any powers?

01:07:58.619 --> 01:07:59.619
Nothing.

01:07:59.619 --> 01:08:00.619
Can you feel another person?

01:08:00.619 --> 01:08:04.829
In collective consciousness, you should be
able to feel another person.

01:08:04.829 --> 01:08:09.490
After realization, immediately you can start
feeling another person and yourself.

01:08:09.490 --> 01:08:15.579
Immediately you can feel, but you need sensitivity
which we lack quite a lot in the Western world

01:08:15.579 --> 01:08:17.380
because the [unclear sounds like 'light is
very small' Side B 36:36].

01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:21.440
But in India I have seen people get realization
(and) immediately they start feeling it like

01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:22.440
that.

01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:27.470
It's very easy to cure Indians, I must say,
but difficult to cure Western people.

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:31.400
They are very complicated, ego-oriented, over-read,
all that is there.

01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:36.330
But once the Western get it, they settle down
much faster, much better, much deeply than

01:08:36.330 --> 01:08:37.339
Indians do.

01:08:37.339 --> 01:08:43.150
It's like if you have the teeth, you don't
have the food; and if you have the food, you

01:08:43.150 --> 01:08:44.380
don't have the teeth.

01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:47.849
It's a funny combination, this world is.

01:08:47.849 --> 01:08:50.290
Q: [unclear Side B 37:04]

01:08:50.290 --> 01:08:52.219
All right, let's have it.

01:08:52.219 --> 01:08:57.389
Now see what sort of thing you work out in
Cambridge.

01:08:57.389 --> 01:08:58.389
All right?

01:08:58.389 --> 01:09:00.589
So all of us should forget all about these
things.

01:09:00.589 --> 01:09:02.980
Be honest to yourself and fair to yourself.

01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:05.940
So far, by doing all these things you haven't
found yourself.

01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:07.559
Accept this fact.

01:09:07.559 --> 01:09:11.689
I have nothing to gain out of you.

01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:17.859
I haven't even written a single line, a book,
nothing.

01:09:17.859 --> 01:09:22.109
So you must know that it is your own.

01:09:22.109 --> 01:09:27.049
I am just like a banker who is cashing your
checks.

01:09:27.049 --> 01:09:32.939
Better have them cashed, for which you don't
have to pay anything.

01:09:32.939 --> 01:09:35.209
You don't have to put in any effort, nothing.

01:09:35.209 --> 01:09:38.779
But once you are realized then you will know
what is to be done.

01:09:38.779 --> 01:09:40.499
But first get your lights on.

01:09:40.499 --> 01:09:46.630
All right, now just co-operate with me as
I tell you, without much questioning.

01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:54.480
I am not going to tell you anything horrid
nor am I going to trouble you by anything.

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:56.204
It is your own blessing just waiting at your
door step.

01:09:56.204 --> 01:09:57.204
Can you believe Me now?

01:09:57.204 --> 01:09:58.204
If you can believe only this much that I am
genuine, it will work out.

01:09:58.204 --> 01:09:59.204
May God bless you.

01:09:59.204 --> 01:10:00.204
All right, now put your hands towards Me and
if it is not very inconvenient, please take

01:10:00.204 --> 01:10:01.204
out your shoes because this Mother Earth also
helps us.

01:10:01.204 --> 01:10:02.204
It's better to take out your shoes; it helps.

01:10:02.204 --> 01:10:03.204
If you are sitting on the ground, it's all
right.

01:10:03.204 --> 01:10:04.204
You have to touch your Mother Earth with your
feet so if you can take out your shoes easily,

01:10:04.204 --> 01:10:05.204
it will work out faster.

01:10:05.204 --> 01:10:06.204
Moreover, it is a very tight thing on the
feet.

01:10:06.204 --> 01:10:07.204
Now this is the question of language of hands
which is an international language always,

01:10:07.204 --> 01:10:08.204
but this is the language where the hands get
enlightened and the hands have to speak.

01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:09.204
As Mohammad Sahib has said it clearly, "At
the time of resurrection, your hands will

01:10:09.204 --> 01:10:10.204
speak".

01:10:10.204 --> 01:10:11.204
So, your hands have to speak and that's how
we have to see how our hands will be speaking.

01:10:11.204 --> 01:10:12.204
So these centers which are shown here are
represented in your fingers.

01:10:12.204 --> 01:10:13.204
So, these are five, six and seven, this side
left and right.

01:10:13.204 --> 01:10:14.204
Once these centers are enlightened, then you
can feel yourself and feel others.

01:10:14.204 --> 01:10:15.204
To begin with, we do not understand what it
is because it is too great a thing.

01:10:15.204 --> 01:10:16.204
But once we start using it, we are amazed
how we start transforming, how things start

01:10:16.204 --> 01:10:17.204
happening to us.

01:10:17.204 --> 01:10:18.204
All right, now just put your hands straight
like this.

01:10:18.204 --> 01:10:19.204
Sit comfortably.

01:10:19.204 --> 01:10:20.204
Be comfortable.

01:10:20.204 --> 01:10:21.204
If you have anything tight, please make it
a little loose.

01:10:21.204 --> 01:10:22.204
It's better.

01:10:22.204 --> 01:10:23.204
Not that it makes any difference; it's very
subtle.

01:10:23.204 --> 01:10:24.204
But why I am asking you because attention
goes there if it is something tight.

01:10:24.204 --> 01:10:25.204
On the waist also if there is something tight
you see the attention is gone.

01:10:25.204 --> 01:10:26.204
Make yourself comfortable.

01:10:26.204 --> 01:10:27.204
That's the main point, be comfortable so that
for a while you could be with yourself comfortably.

01:10:27.204 --> 01:10:28.204
If you are wearing any big malas and all that,
please take it out.

01:10:28.204 --> 01:10:29.204
It's better.

01:10:29.204 --> 01:10:30.204
It's heavy.

01:10:30.204 --> 01:10:31.204
Anything like that, please take it out.

01:10:31.204 --> 01:10:32.204
It will help us.

01:10:32.204 --> 01:10:33.204
Just first get yourself realized and then
you start understanding.

01:10:33.204 --> 01:10:34.204
Now, after this I have to tell you one more
thing that you have to keep your eyes shut.

01:10:34.204 --> 01:10:35.204
The reason is that when the Kundalini rises
above this which it wants to pierce through,

01:10:35.204 --> 01:10:36.204
at that time it presses this point and the
pupils go into dilatation first before it

01:10:36.204 --> 01:10:37.204
is piercing it and that's why, if the eyes
are open and the Kundalini is passing through,

01:10:37.204 --> 01:10:38.204
She may stop.

01:10:38.204 --> 01:10:39.204
So please keep your eyes shut, that's all.

01:10:39.204 --> 01:10:40.204
Just keep your eyes shut till I tell you to
open them.

01:10:40.204 --> 01:10:41.204
And if you have spectacles and all that, you
can also keep them safe because you don't

01:10:41.204 --> 01:10:42.204
have to see Me anymore till I ask you to open
your eyes.

01:10:42.204 --> 01:10:43.204
So it's better to keep so that you don't have
problems of your spectacles.

01:10:43.204 --> 01:10:44.204
Now close your eyes.

01:10:44.204 --> 01:10:45.204
Now don't open your eyes as I requested you.

01:10:45.204 --> 01:10:46.204
Please don't open your eyes, that's all.

01:10:46.204 --> 01:10:47.204
Because this is just the opposite of hypnosis.

01:10:47.204 --> 01:10:48.204
In hypnosis, they make you open your eyes
and put their eyes into your eyes and do all

01:10:48.204 --> 01:10:49.204
these things.

01:10:49.204 --> 01:10:50.204
What's happening?

01:10:50.204 --> 01:10:51.204
Now, no gesticulations, nothing abnormal has
to be done.

01:10:51.204 --> 01:10:52.204
Whatever has to happen will happen within.

01:10:52.204 --> 01:10:53.204
Nothing abnormal thing has to be done.

01:10:53.204 --> 01:10:54.204
Nobody has to jump, shout or scream - that's
all nonsense.

01:10:54.204 --> 01:10:55.204
You are not to do anything like that, not
to turn your necks or anything.

01:10:55.204 --> 01:10:56.204
Just keep quiet.

01:10:56.204 --> 01:10:57.204
If you cannot keep quiet, it's better that
you go out for the time being.

01:10:57.204 --> 01:10:58.204
But just keep quiet.

01:10:58.204 --> 01:10:58.211
That's very important not to disturb others.
