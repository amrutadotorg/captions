1
00:00:03,373 --> 00:00:07,263
Today we are going to worship Shri Krishna

2
00:00:10,353 --> 00:00:16,233
as a very great personality.

3
00:00:17,383 --> 00:00:22,443
And you know why He came on this earth –

4
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:32,323
to establish this is the new form of, not Virat, not Virata,

5
00:00:34,203 --> 00:00:44,213
but a form by which this country became so prosperous.

6
00:00:49,423 --> 00:00:57,233
And by His advent only He created a beautiful mentality

7
00:00:57,363 --> 00:01:06,403
among the people how to develop this country with Dharma.

8
00:01:09,253 --> 00:01:11,343
And you had very great leaders

9
00:01:14,253 --> 00:01:16,293
who followed Him

10
00:01:19,253 --> 00:01:24,213
and who worshipped Him in a way,

11
00:01:25,323 --> 00:01:31,243
and created a new world of this America.

12
00:01:33,383 --> 00:01:36,373
But unfortunately as the time passed on,

13
00:01:37,413 --> 00:01:44,423
His form vanished from the minds of the people.

14
00:01:46,293 --> 00:01:50,333
The reason was, Krishna was represented here

15
00:01:51,223 --> 00:01:56,213
by very, very wrong type of people who had no idea

16
00:01:56,373 --> 00:01:59,303
about Shri Krishna:

17
00:02:02,443 --> 00:02:10,343
that He was a great master of wealth,

18
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:18,243
that He knew how to use the wealth and how to create

19
00:02:18,373 --> 00:02:22,373
the wealth with dharma, not with adharma.

20
00:02:24,373 --> 00:02:28,383
They all forgot about it completely

21
00:02:29,293 --> 00:02:33,273
and gradually started using maneuvering powers,

22
00:02:33,443 --> 00:02:43,303
all kinds of, all kinds of adharmic things – cheating, grabbing

23
00:02:43,443 --> 00:02:52,203
money, spending their money in absolutely useless things.

24
00:02:54,443 --> 00:02:59,323
He is Kubera. He doesn’t need any money, of course,

25
00:03:00,373 --> 00:03:03,413
He achieves money;

26
00:03:05,443 --> 00:03:08,213
and not only that,

27
00:03:08,403 --> 00:03:12,223
He is living, He lived in money.

28
00:03:13,243 --> 00:03:19,363
They said that He created a golden house for Him,

29
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:25,283
absolutely made with gold in Dwarika,

30
00:03:25,443 --> 00:03:28,323
but it submerged in the water,

31
00:03:28,413 --> 00:03:35,303
in the sea, and nobody believed that it is true.

32
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:40,303
But now they have found out His house under the water,

33
00:03:40,403 --> 00:03:42,233
very deep waters,

34
00:03:43,203 --> 00:03:50,233
so all their conjecture about Him was wrong, all false;

35
00:03:50,373 --> 00:03:54,403
that He was definitely a man who made lots of money

36
00:03:55,273 --> 00:03:56,403
by dharma.

37
00:03:57,313 --> 00:04:02,253
Also He was a son of a king, and He built this Dwarika

38
00:04:02,413 --> 00:04:05,243
out of gold.

39
00:04:05,363 --> 00:04:09,333
It is still there and people have found it,

40
00:04:10,323 --> 00:04:13,363
but under the sea.

41
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:19,203
Thousands of years have passed, but still existed.

42
00:04:20,223 --> 00:04:23,403
Only because perhaps we belong to Shri Krishna,

43
00:04:24,273 --> 00:04:26,273
it is still existing.

44
00:04:26,413 --> 00:04:31,293
That’s what it is, because He was the one

45
00:04:31,423 --> 00:04:35,303
who was for satya first – truth.

46
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:42,353
He was for truth, and He worked out everything

47
00:04:43,243 --> 00:04:46,413
on the principle of truth.

48
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:51,243
Whatever was not truth, He tried to finish it off.

49
00:04:51,383 --> 00:04:58,283
Whatever was destructive, He tried to remove that;

50
00:04:58,443 --> 00:05:05,403
and He established Himself through truth only, truth only.

51
00:05:06,323 --> 00:05:10,393
He’s the one who represent the truth, absolute truth,

52
00:05:11,363 --> 00:05:16,233
and how the truth can prevail in everything.

53
00:05:20,313 --> 00:05:23,203
I’m just the opposite of Him because I don’t understand

54
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,273
money at all,

55
00:05:25,423 --> 00:05:30,203
but He’s looking after that part in My life.

56
00:05:30,403 --> 00:05:33,363
I’m so hopelessly bad –

57
00:05:34,273 --> 00:05:38,443
I don’t understand banking, I don’t understand money,

58
00:05:39,353 --> 00:05:44,273
I can’t even count money. Now what can you say to that?

59
00:05:45,273 --> 00:05:47,443
But He’s there to look after,

60
00:05:48,343 --> 00:05:52,433
and I've never a dearth of money, never a dearth of any

61
00:05:53,443 --> 00:05:58,223
wealth, it’s all full of it.

62
00:05:59,223 --> 00:06:04,293
Also it comes through your sense of satisfaction.

63
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:08,383
If you have that sense of satisfaction,

64
00:06:09,253 --> 00:06:13,433
you don’t look for money.

65
00:06:14,323 --> 00:06:18,363
What happened in your country that some people got money.

66
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:23,233
If you got little money, then you get the taste of money.

67
00:06:23,403 --> 00:06:26,243
They’re not satisfied people.

68
00:06:26,373 --> 00:06:31,403
So like mad they went on spending on nonsensical things.

69
00:06:33,343 --> 00:06:36,383
It is something very much human.

70
00:06:37,293 --> 00:06:40,433
After your human evolution,

71
00:06:41,303 --> 00:06:45,263
after you have reached a certain state of enlightenment,

72
00:06:45,443 --> 00:06:52,443
then all these demeaning things like greed

73
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:57,293
all disappear from your character.

74
00:06:57,293 --> 00:07:01,383
You don’t have that greed in you anymore

75
00:07:02,283 --> 00:07:07,213
and you become extremely a satisfied person.

76
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:11,433
To you money is there, all right, but it’s not so important.

77
00:07:13,213 --> 00:07:21,333
It is just that you think don’t need it, and you’ll get it –

78
00:07:22,253 --> 00:07:25,443
all done by Shri Krishna all over, can you imagine?

79
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:29,323
He’s doing all this, looking after you

80
00:07:30,203 --> 00:07:33,443
and helping you with money.

81
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:37,413
We started Sahaja Yoga without a single pai.

82
00:07:38,303 --> 00:07:41,303
I don’t, never had any problem.

83
00:07:41,443 --> 00:07:49,293
So one thing, as Kubera He’s the supplier of wealth.

84
00:07:49,433 --> 00:07:53,223
He looks after people who don’t have money.

85
00:07:53,363 --> 00:07:57,263
He gives money to people who stand by truth,

86
00:07:57,423 --> 00:08:02,353
who enjoy the life of truth.

87
00:08:05,313 --> 00:08:17,383
It is His work that people enjoy wealth, otherwise they don’t.

88
00:08:18,423 --> 00:08:20,343
They have this much, they want to have more;

89
00:08:21,263 --> 00:08:23,353
that means they don’t enjoy the wealth.

90
00:08:24,223 --> 00:08:27,243
They have a little, they want to get much more. Why?

91
00:08:27,383 --> 00:08:32,293
Because they are not enjoying whatever they have.

92
00:08:32,413 --> 00:08:36,353
But after Self-realization you will see that you enjoy

93
00:08:37,253 --> 00:08:39,353
whatever you have.

94
00:08:40,223 --> 00:08:43,303
You enjoy it fully, absolutely,

95
00:08:43,413 --> 00:08:47,313
and you don’t hanker after something that is not there.

96
00:08:47,413 --> 00:08:50,223
Doesn’t matter if you don’t have.

97
00:08:51,243 --> 00:08:53,213
Many a times people have asked Me,

98
00:08:53,343 --> 00:08:58,353
“Mother, why not we have the puja of Krishna as Kubera?”

99
00:08:58,433 --> 00:09:00,323
I said, “All right.

100
00:09:00,433 --> 00:09:03,273
Just now everybody’s trying to become Kuber.

101
00:09:03,403 --> 00:09:05,363
Let them learn a lesson,

102
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:09,373
and then we will have the puja of Kubera.”

103
00:09:10,223 --> 00:09:15,263
And that’s why today I’ve agreed to have this puja.

104
00:09:16,443 --> 00:09:21,323
Because now you have seen what happens if you have greed.

105
00:09:22,373 --> 00:09:26,353
You go on committing all kinds of sins,

106
00:09:26,443 --> 00:09:32,213
all kinds of wrong things which can destroy your country.

107
00:09:32,313 --> 00:09:35,443
Such a rich country has now become a poor country.

108
00:09:36,273 --> 00:09:38,363
Where is that money gone?

109
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,253
They’re very clever.

110
00:09:40,343 --> 00:09:43,443
Somebody told Me today that this money with the insurance.

111
00:09:43,443 --> 00:09:46,323
“My God,” I said, “the law is such that

112
00:09:46,403 --> 00:09:48,433
you can’t get out that money.”

113
00:09:49,293 --> 00:09:53,283
Secondly they said that it is in offshore and all that.

114
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:59,263
I said, “But see now, they were never afraid

115
00:10:00,393 --> 00:10:03,433
that they'll be caught up,

116
00:10:04,363 --> 00:10:08,243
and they continued for so many years.

117
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:12,283
But I’m sure one day

118
00:10:12,353 --> 00:10:16,373
they'll all be exposed by Kubera Himself.”

119
00:10:17,303 --> 00:10:22,293
So today by worshipping Kubera what we are doing,

120
00:10:22,393 --> 00:10:28,283
we are going to establish, establish the truth of money,

121
00:10:29,203 --> 00:10:33,213
what lies behind the money,

122
00:10:37,363 --> 00:10:43,203
what is the point of having money.

123
00:10:43,263 --> 00:10:45,243
This country had money.

124
00:10:45,363 --> 00:10:50,363
As a result so many good people came here to work,

125
00:10:51,213 --> 00:10:54,273
and you had so many complementary things.

126
00:10:55,203 --> 00:10:58,383
You had lots of people who have complemented,

127
00:10:59,223 --> 00:11:03,203
because I think in certain things Americans were little less;

128
00:11:03,303 --> 00:11:07,283
not in intelligence, but in brilliance I think

129
00:11:07,353 --> 00:11:09,423
they were little bit lacking.

130
00:11:10,273 --> 00:11:13,253
So they got very brilliant people from abroad,

131
00:11:13,343 --> 00:11:18,383
and also they were very focused people,

132
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:21,313
so they worked it out very well.

133
00:11:21,423 --> 00:11:26,243
Also they respected people who came with brains.

134
00:11:26,363 --> 00:11:29,423
So this is what happens when you forget

135
00:11:30,313 --> 00:11:34,213
that truth is the main point.

136
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:39,223
If you don’t have the truth, no use having money.

137
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:44,203
Because what you did was to go around with this thing,

138
00:11:44,283 --> 00:11:50,353
that thing, I mean all kinds of things, to just get money.

139
00:11:52,203 --> 00:11:55,373
The other day I was traveling through Las Vegas – last year.

140
00:11:57,223 --> 00:11:59,323
And when we stopped at that airport

141
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:03,243
so many people walked into the aeroplane,

142
00:12:03,403 --> 00:12:05,393
and they all were looking as if somebody’s dead

143
00:12:06,273 --> 00:12:07,383
in their family or what has happened.

144
00:12:08,303 --> 00:12:10,263
First I couldn’t understand.

145
00:12:10,383 --> 00:12:14,323
Then said, “Mother, they have lost all their money.”

146
00:12:18,413 --> 00:12:22,313
So when they have money, they are jumping, next moment

147
00:12:22,423 --> 00:12:24,443
they are crying because they have lost the money.

148
00:12:25,293 --> 00:12:27,323
What’s the use of such a money

149
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:32,213
which is so temporary, which is so useless?

150
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:37,443
But that is human nature, to run after maya.

151
00:12:38,353 --> 00:12:45,213
And this is the quality of money, that it gives you maya.

152
00:12:45,403 --> 00:12:50,293
Maya like this, that they get a little money somehow;

153
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:54,413
with that little money, they buy something.

154
00:12:55,283 --> 00:12:58,263
Then they think money is very important.

155
00:12:58,393 --> 00:13:01,303
You see, you can buy lots of things,

156
00:13:01,403 --> 00:13:04,313
you can buy cars, you can buy airplanes, this, that.

157
00:13:05,293 --> 00:13:10,323
So there is where maya plays on you, and you start running

158
00:13:10,443 --> 00:13:15,213
after that mad money which makes you mad.

159
00:13:15,323 --> 00:13:19,423
It’s nice that at this juncture they have discovered

160
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,403
the falsehood of this maya money.

161
00:13:24,293 --> 00:13:28,223
And I am so happy that they were all handcuffed,

162
00:13:28,353 --> 00:13:34,213
and all their power of money was finished.

163
00:13:34,373 --> 00:13:39,323
So, this Kubera is working out all these tricks.

164
00:13:40,363 --> 00:13:46,283
Krishna is a very tricky, extremely tricky personality.

165
00:13:46,423 --> 00:13:52,443
He puts the tricks, every action after every action.

166
00:13:54,223 --> 00:13:56,283
Now money matters:

167
00:13:56,423 --> 00:14:02,213
He first befools you that you run after it,

168
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:07,383
and then you just discover that it was stupidity.

169
00:14:08,243 --> 00:14:13,203
We have a story in our land, country, called “Sheikh Chili.”

170
00:14:13,313 --> 00:14:15,283
He got little money,

171
00:14:15,423 --> 00:14:21,263
and he got into the grab of this maya.

172
00:14:21,383 --> 00:14:24,423
So he thought, “I can do very well.”

173
00:14:25,273 --> 00:14:28,223
So he started dreaming as to what he should do.

174
00:14:28,373 --> 00:14:32,243
So he went and bought lots of eggs and he said,

175
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:37,243
“Now these eggs will have little, little chicks which will grow,

176
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:40,293
which will I’ll sell and I’ll so much money,”

177
00:14:40,373 --> 00:14:42,303
and it was like that he was talking.

178
00:14:43,253 --> 00:14:48,433
And while thinking about it in his mind went off to sleep,

179
00:14:49,293 --> 00:14:52,393
and then in his sleep he fell on the eggs

180
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:56,283
and all the eggs broke.

181
00:14:56,393 --> 00:14:59,333
So the maya was over.

182
00:15:00,243 --> 00:15:03,303
This should happen early, but if it doesn’t happen

183
00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:08,303
then you end up in the jail or something like that.

184
00:15:08,443 --> 00:15:15,223
Sahaja Yoga is one thing which gives you a complete vision,

185
00:15:15,303 --> 00:15:18,273
complete vision of the destruction

186
00:15:18,393 --> 00:15:23,213
that can follow this maya business.

187
00:15:23,433 --> 00:15:28,273
It is something, such a insight

188
00:15:28,403 --> 00:15:31,303
that you don’t have to do anything with it.

189
00:15:32,243 --> 00:15:36,213
I'm different, I told you I don’t understand it at all.

190
00:15:36,323 --> 00:15:40,213
But even if you understand the value of money,

191
00:15:40,313 --> 00:15:44,223
even if you understand that money can bring

192
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:49,293
lots of things to you, despite that you don’t look at it,

193
00:15:49,373 --> 00:15:55,363
just turn your face – that is the sign of a real Sahaja yogi.

194
00:15:55,433 --> 00:15:59,283
To him it doesn’t matter, temperamentally.

195
00:15:59,363 --> 00:16:04,223
It’s not that he does something for that or tells his mind, nothing;

196
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:09,263
temperamentally he doesn’t care for money,

197
00:16:09,353 --> 00:16:13,343
just because he’s above it.

198
00:16:13,443 --> 00:16:17,373
The one who is above money is a real Sahaja yogi.

199
00:16:18,213 --> 00:16:21,403
The one who is engulfed in the nonsense

200
00:16:22,233 --> 00:16:26,223
and the maya of money is not a Sahaja yogi.

201
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,333
Of course I have seen most of the Sahaja yogis

202
00:16:28,413 --> 00:16:31,203
are extremely honest, specially in the West.

203
00:16:31,343 --> 00:16:35,323
But in India there’s a disease: as you have some here viruses,

204
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:39,303
we have certain viruses in India also.

205
00:16:39,443 --> 00:16:42,213
So they still go on running after money,

206
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,333
to them money is important.

207
00:16:45,243 --> 00:16:48,423
But in the evolutionary process if you reach a certain state

208
00:16:49,293 --> 00:16:52,343
where you rise above your Nabhi Chakra,

209
00:16:53,223 --> 00:16:58,203
rise your Nabhi Chakra, then money’s not so important.

210
00:16:58,313 --> 00:17:00,373
It’s not so important.

211
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:14,233
To Me, I find I cannot buy things unnecessarily.

212
00:17:15,393 --> 00:17:17,433
Of course I mean there are so many unnecessary things

213
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:22,343
gathered, because you people give Me here presents, this that.

214
00:17:23,213 --> 00:17:28,203
But Myself, you’ll be amazed, I’m so nervous or I should say

215
00:17:28,283 --> 00:17:34,323
hesitant, or you may call it absolutely absent from the spot

216
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:39,303
where they are doing any business, any purchasing.

217
00:17:41,233 --> 00:17:43,443
Come here and fix it please.

218
00:17:49,233 --> 00:17:52,373
It falls down, so I'm holding on!

219
00:17:57,303 --> 00:18:01,293
Correct, now all right.

220
00:18:03,393 --> 00:18:11,393
In the same way, Sahaja yogis have to fix their mind

221
00:18:19,293 --> 00:18:21,413
to their spirit,

222
00:18:22,313 --> 00:18:28,293
and enjoy the powers of your spirit, your own.

223
00:18:28,433 --> 00:18:35,263
That enjoyment once you get it, you don’t fall to your greed.

224
00:18:36,303 --> 00:18:38,233
This is something

225
00:18:38,403 --> 00:18:43,203
very, very simple,

226
00:18:43,383 --> 00:18:46,283
but sometimes you don’t do it.

227
00:18:46,423 --> 00:18:52,213
You get enamored by something, maybe a car,

228
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,323
maybe aeroplane, I don’t know what – whatever it is.

229
00:18:56,213 --> 00:19:00,223
It’s a headache to have too many cars, isn’t it?

230
00:19:01,383 --> 00:19:03,343
But people have;

231
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:06,263
they think by that people are impressed,

232
00:19:06,383 --> 00:19:09,353
and they think no end of themselves or not – nothing.

233
00:19:10,273 --> 00:19:13,423
If they are impressed, what is the use to us?

234
00:19:14,283 --> 00:19:16,403
What do you get out of it?

235
00:19:17,263 --> 00:19:22,323
Sahaja yogi has his own spirit to enjoy,

236
00:19:22,433 --> 00:19:24,303
more than anything else.

237
00:19:25,213 --> 00:19:26,423
He doesn’t want to possess anything.

238
00:19:27,293 --> 00:19:30,223
It’s a headache to possess things also.

239
00:19:30,363 --> 00:19:34,313
The other side of it is a Mahalakshmi.

240
00:19:35,303 --> 00:19:38,383
If that principle is within you, Mahalakshmi Principle,

241
00:19:39,273 --> 00:19:41,403
you’ll have never a problem of money.

242
00:19:42,273 --> 00:19:45,283
On the contrary, you’ll know how to stop it.

243
00:19:45,413 --> 00:19:49,423
So far as I am concerned,

244
00:19:50,283 --> 00:19:54,343
I get fed up of My Mahalakshmi Principle

245
00:19:55,223 --> 00:19:57,313
because I don’t know from where it works out,

246
00:19:57,433 --> 00:20:03,343
how it works out, without any effort.

247
00:20:05,343 --> 00:20:10,443
But the temperamentally, I have no interest at all,

248
00:20:11,323 --> 00:20:13,403
temperamentally.

249
00:20:14,323 --> 00:20:21,323
But it is the, I don’t know what is the cause of this effect.

250
00:20:23,253 --> 00:20:27,213
Now supposing I buy some small thing, just like that,

251
00:20:27,363 --> 00:20:31,423
it will sell at least ten times more.

252
00:20:32,313 --> 00:20:36,363
It will be of value at least ten times more, I don’t know how.

253
00:20:37,423 --> 00:20:43,333
It’s very surprising – automatically.

254
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:51,203
I’ll buy something very small, then I find it’s very expensive.

255
00:20:51,393 --> 00:20:56,423
How it works, just must be miracles of Mahalakshmi, I think.

256
00:20:57,343 --> 00:21:01,363
So what I have to tell you is this,

257
00:21:02,273 --> 00:21:07,393
that you should not worry about your financial situations

258
00:21:08,243 --> 00:21:10,233
at all.

259
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:12,293
Do not go on calculating,

260
00:21:12,413 --> 00:21:17,203
do not see how much money you have in the bank,

261
00:21:17,323 --> 00:21:19,203
what you have to do with your money,

262
00:21:19,313 --> 00:21:20,343
where you should invest.

263
00:21:21,243 --> 00:21:25,203
I have seen people going mad planning the whole thing.

264
00:21:25,373 --> 00:21:29,293
There’s no need to do that once you are a Sahaja yogi.

265
00:21:29,423 --> 00:21:33,203
It all works automatically.

266
00:21:33,313 --> 00:21:37,293
The greed is within you, just like any other disease.

267
00:21:37,433 --> 00:21:41,253
As you have diseases, greed is also there.

268
00:21:41,413 --> 00:21:45,343
As your diseases can get cured with Sahaja Yoga,

269
00:21:46,253 --> 00:21:54,433
your diseases, as much as your greed is, it vanishes.

270
00:21:56,263 --> 00:21:59,353
You don’t know what is greed is.

271
00:22:00,443 --> 00:22:05,323
The only way to counter-balance is to become extremely

272
00:22:05,433 --> 00:22:08,293
generous.

273
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:13,223
If you are extremely generous, greed will run away.

274
00:22:13,353 --> 00:22:16,323
That may be another way of doing it.

275
00:22:17,313 --> 00:22:23,253
Supposing you get something in your house

276
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,273
and you think it is too much.

277
00:22:28,203 --> 00:22:31,233
Not to get rid of it but just to think it’s too much,

278
00:22:31,233 --> 00:22:33,253
you should give it to someone; you just start thinking,

279
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:35,253
whom can you give?

280
00:22:35,433 --> 00:22:37,443
And immediately you’ll remember,

281
00:22:38,303 --> 00:22:42,303
“Oh, that person doesn’t have this. Let me give him this.”

282
00:22:43,203 --> 00:22:46,363
And if you give him he’ll be so thankful, so thankful,

283
00:22:47,243 --> 00:22:50,313
and he’ll say all kinds of nice things to you

284
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:55,203
which normally nobody would say to you, nobody.

285
00:22:58,433 --> 00:23:04,293
And it’s surprising how joy-giving it is,

286
00:23:04,413 --> 00:23:09,243
how people like your generosity.

287
00:23:09,363 --> 00:23:12,363
So you have to be generous, just generous;

288
00:23:13,233 --> 00:23:15,333
not with yourself, but with others.

289
00:23:16,223 --> 00:23:21,253
As much as possible, be generous.

290
00:23:22,313 --> 00:23:30,293
Generosity is very love-giving, one of the expressions

291
00:23:30,413 --> 00:23:33,293
of your love.

292
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:37,393
Many a times it has happened with Me

293
00:23:38,273 --> 00:23:42,393
that I saw somebody needed something,

294
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:46,283
and kept it in My mind.

295
00:23:46,443 --> 00:23:50,293
Then I bought that thing and gave it to that person.

296
00:23:51,213 --> 00:23:56,343
And the amount of love that person gave Me

297
00:23:57,223 --> 00:23:59,243
was thousand time more

298
00:23:59,383 --> 00:24:07,203
than what I would have got joy out of buying it, by that thing.

299
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:11,303
It was so insipid for Me, but for him it was.... He told so

300
00:24:11,403 --> 00:24:16,243
many people, “Mother gave me this. Mother gave me.”

301
00:24:16,353 --> 00:24:18,423
I mean, I was surprised.

302
00:24:19,283 --> 00:24:21,383
Then they asked Me, “Mother, how did You give him?”

303
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:24,373
I said, “Just out of love.”

304
00:24:25,253 --> 00:24:28,283
Many people took to Sahaja Yoga thinking,

305
00:24:28,373 --> 00:24:31,233
“What a generosity is!”

306
00:24:31,353 --> 00:24:35,423
So to be generous is the best way to live in this world.

307
00:24:37,303 --> 00:24:41,203
After all it’s a headache to have too many things.

308
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:45,413
Better to get rid of them, but out of love.

309
00:24:46,263 --> 00:24:48,383
If you do that,

310
00:24:49,273 --> 00:24:54,283
you’ll be know how much they’ll be appreciative of you.

311
00:24:55,293 --> 00:25:02,403
Another thing is, to get greed of, to get rid of greed

312
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:09,323
you should try to do some sort of a collective social work.

313
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:15,353
Supposing you go to some place where lots of poor people

314
00:25:16,213 --> 00:25:20,313
are there, I tell you your greed will just drop out.

315
00:25:21,433 --> 00:25:23,443
You’ll be amazed how these people are living,

316
00:25:24,313 --> 00:25:26,233
in what conditions.

317
00:25:26,343 --> 00:25:30,313
“Why do I care for all the wealth and everything?”

318
00:25:31,293 --> 00:25:34,263
That will be just shocking.

319
00:25:34,373 --> 00:25:37,323
Sometimes, you see, you see people

320
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:42,353
in India also in a very bad condition.

321
00:25:43,213 --> 00:25:45,373
Once I went to Calcutta

322
00:25:47,293 --> 00:25:52,403
and I was so – somehow or other you see by chance,

323
00:25:53,263 --> 00:25:58,243
I happened to be in places where people were very, in a very,

324
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:03,353
very great poverty, even the children.

325
00:26:04,223 --> 00:26:07,413
And you’ll be amazed, for days together I wouldn’t eat My food.

326
00:26:08,303 --> 00:26:12,243
I was crying and not eating My food, I just didn’t know

327
00:26:12,343 --> 00:26:14,303
what to do.

328
00:26:14,413 --> 00:26:17,423
Because I felt, “What is this?

329
00:26:18,323 --> 00:26:21,323
Why these people are so poor?”

330
00:26:21,423 --> 00:26:25,323
And I was helpless so I was crying,

331
00:26:25,413 --> 00:26:31,303
that one day I should try to do something for them.

332
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:36,213
It is really remarkable, at a very young age of Mine

333
00:26:36,433 --> 00:26:45,263
I started a leper home, I started a infirmary, a refugee home,

334
00:26:46,293 --> 00:26:48,323
all kinds of things.

335
00:26:50,283 --> 00:26:55,413
And I never even thought that whatever money I have,

336
00:26:57,273 --> 00:27:04,273
if I give to these people I may have to give up some things.

337
00:27:05,283 --> 00:27:07,343
I also sold some of My things,

338
00:27:08,213 --> 00:27:12,333
because so pleasure-giving I tell you, so pleasure-giving,

339
00:27:13,213 --> 00:27:16,363
so joy-giving to be generous.

340
00:27:17,343 --> 00:27:24,263
It is so pain in every way that you should be generous.

341
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:27,373
That is the quality of Kubera.

342
00:27:28,283 --> 00:27:32,273
He’s an extremely generous personality,

343
00:27:33,283 --> 00:27:37,343
and that’s what’s personality you should be.

344
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:41,353
So, I’ve seen that Sahaja yogis are very generous.

345
00:27:42,353 --> 00:27:48,213
So far nobody has told Me that somebody is a miserly fellow –

346
00:27:48,343 --> 00:27:51,303
so far, so far.

347
00:27:52,263 --> 00:27:57,443
But I’m sure one day will come when we’ll have people

348
00:27:58,303 --> 00:28:02,213
of very high quality.

349
00:28:02,323 --> 00:28:06,283
In Sahaja Yoga we don’t say like other cults say that

350
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:12,333
you give up your clothes, you give up your family, you stay,

351
00:28:13,213 --> 00:28:18,443
stay in a forest or in a hut or anything – nothing of the kind.

352
00:28:19,303 --> 00:28:22,323
Don’t give up anything.

353
00:28:22,423 --> 00:28:26,423
You have to give up from your heart.

354
00:28:27,303 --> 00:28:29,423
Just it should happen in your personality;

355
00:28:30,273 --> 00:28:32,413
don’t have to give up.

356
00:28:33,293 --> 00:28:42,213
And if you have that well-built in spirituality,

357
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:50,263
you’ll not even think of grabbing someone.

358
00:28:51,353 --> 00:28:54,303
On the contrary,

359
00:28:54,443 --> 00:28:57,393
you would like to give up everything.

360
00:28:58,263 --> 00:29:01,263
My father was even worse than Me, I should say.

361
00:29:02,313 --> 00:29:05,333
He always used to leave the house open, all doors open.

362
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:10,343
He said, “No thief will come in if you keep the doors closed.”

363
00:29:11,203 --> 00:29:13,313
So one day a thief came

364
00:29:14,203 --> 00:29:17,363
and he took away his gramophone – in the old times,

365
00:29:18,213 --> 00:29:21,393
these big horn ones – he took away.

366
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:25,363
The next day My father was sitting, very sad.

367
00:29:26,243 --> 00:29:27,303
So My mother asked him,

368
00:29:27,403 --> 00:29:29,333
“Why are you sad, because of the gramophone?”

369
00:29:30,213 --> 00:29:33,323
“No, I’m only sad because it seems he is a connoisseur of

370
00:29:33,443 --> 00:29:40,313
music, he has taken the gramophone but no records.”

371
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:44,443
So My mother said, “All right, what should we do?

372
00:29:45,313 --> 00:29:48,263
Should we advertise in the newspaper that you take away

373
00:29:48,383 --> 00:29:51,413
your records?”

374
00:29:53,353 --> 00:29:59,273
I mean, it's such a beauty, that even after so many years

375
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:02,423
I am telling you and you are enjoying.

376
00:30:03,283 --> 00:30:07,423
What a beautiful character it was of generosity.

377
00:30:08,303 --> 00:30:13,233
But if you force it through religion,

378
00:30:13,373 --> 00:30:18,203
through any such ideas that “you give up that, you give” –

379
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:21,213
don’t have to give up.

380
00:30:21,343 --> 00:30:25,343
You give up from within.

381
00:30:26,293 --> 00:30:30,323
If you are not attached to it, you have given up.

382
00:30:30,443 --> 00:30:34,263
That much should be there and if you all enjoy your

383
00:30:34,403 --> 00:30:39,403
generosity and charity, nothing like it!

384
00:30:40,303 --> 00:30:44,403
I have known people who are very rich and all that,

385
00:30:45,293 --> 00:30:49,243
but they lack generosity.

386
00:30:49,363 --> 00:30:52,363
That is another quality of Kubera.

387
00:30:53,233 --> 00:30:56,393
He perhaps understand banking, perhaps.

388
00:30:57,263 --> 00:31:01,253
That time there were no banks but I think must be,

389
00:31:01,353 --> 00:31:04,233
because the way He manages banks, you know,

390
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:08,283
it seems to Me that He’s sitting on top of them,

391
00:31:08,403 --> 00:31:13,213
and that’s why still in the banks there is no problem.

392
00:31:13,363 --> 00:31:14,413
I don’t know.

393
00:31:15,283 --> 00:31:21,293
But He’s a very clever person,

394
00:31:23,443 --> 00:31:25,423
very intelligent,

395
00:31:26,293 --> 00:31:28,313
very alert,

396
00:31:29,353 --> 00:31:34,353
which is important if you have to deal with money –

397
00:31:35,403 --> 00:31:40,253
though He was absolutely detached from money.

398
00:31:41,213 --> 00:31:44,223
And just see His life, what He did.

399
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:49,243
He lived in childhood with His guru,

400
00:31:49,403 --> 00:31:51,363
and He used to take

401
00:31:52,243 --> 00:32:01,323
what you call the cows and herds outside in the jungles.

402
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:09,333
That is how He lived in His childhood, and later on

403
00:32:12,223 --> 00:32:16,433
He was playing with the boys

404
00:32:17,283 --> 00:32:21,433
who were looking after the cows in a very,

405
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:25,273
I mean, ordinary family.

406
00:32:29,253 --> 00:32:32,323
He never hankered after money.

407
00:32:33,293 --> 00:32:34,433
He used to steal,

408
00:32:36,423 --> 00:32:42,223
used to steal the butter,

409
00:32:42,413 --> 00:32:48,323
because these ladies used to sell these to Kamsa’s

410
00:32:52,323 --> 00:32:55,253
military people.

411
00:32:56,203 --> 00:32:58,303
So He used to eat that,

412
00:32:58,403 --> 00:33:02,233
so that this lady should not give it to them.

413
00:33:02,373 --> 00:33:06,293
Just imagine, such a little boy like Him.

414
00:33:06,413 --> 00:33:13,313
So actually, how He was teaching them a lesson.

415
00:33:14,203 --> 00:33:17,413
Those ladies were greedy, and wanted to give that

416
00:33:18,293 --> 00:33:20,423
to these horrible soldiers,

417
00:33:21,283 --> 00:33:26,273
and He would eat all that butter Himself.

418
00:33:26,383 --> 00:33:29,323
In everything that He did,

419
00:33:30,203 --> 00:33:35,353
what you see is extreme generosity, extreme generosity.

420
00:33:37,203 --> 00:33:42,223
With all His intelligence He, He was so good.

421
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:50,403
And He killed

422
00:33:54,433 --> 00:33:58,413
His own uncle, I should say;

423
00:34:00,393 --> 00:34:03,293
but for Him it is, was not important,

424
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:07,363
so-called relations were not important.

425
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:11,363
But what you see in our India specially,

426
00:34:12,243 --> 00:34:14,383
that relations are very important.

427
00:34:15,243 --> 00:34:19,333
The father is a thief, his son is thief, his grandson is a thief,

428
00:34:19,423 --> 00:34:24,293
all of them are thieves – can you imagine?

429
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:30,293
I haven’t seen in a family if there’s one person who is a thief,

430
00:34:30,393 --> 00:34:35,213
any one his progeny are honest.

431
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:40,373
It’s a very funny thing, but such greed crawls into their minds

432
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:45,353
that they don’t think is important.

433
00:34:46,233 --> 00:34:51,353
They just think that stealing is the only way one can live.

434
00:34:52,253 --> 00:34:56,393
Though in India there are people who are extremely honest.

435
00:34:57,203 --> 00:34:58,283
I have seen our servants,

436
00:34:58,423 --> 00:35:01,383
they never steal anything, nothing, never.

437
00:35:02,343 --> 00:35:04,413
I don’t know, they have no reasoning for it,

438
00:35:05,273 --> 00:35:07,253
it’s a matter of habit.

439
00:35:07,343 --> 00:35:12,423
They never steal anything – very surprising.

440
00:35:16,233 --> 00:35:18,373
Why, why don’t they steal?

441
00:35:19,353 --> 00:35:24,333
They’re happy with their lives, they don’t want to change it.

442
00:35:24,423 --> 00:35:30,213
They don’t want to have these horrible things

443
00:35:30,343 --> 00:35:32,393
that can put them in jail.

444
00:35:33,243 --> 00:35:35,293
But they don’t know,

445
00:35:35,373 --> 00:35:40,203
they don’t even think about it; just they just don’t do it.

446
00:35:41,203 --> 00:35:46,323
Why, because they have a sense of shame.

447
00:35:47,223 --> 00:35:50,433
In the poorer peoples, sense of shame is very,

448
00:35:51,273 --> 00:35:53,213
very developed.

449
00:35:53,303 --> 00:36:01,253
In that society they have a great respect for people who are

450
00:36:01,343 --> 00:36:04,243
honest, and they are all honest.

451
00:36:04,403 --> 00:36:08,443
One of them may be not,

452
00:36:09,303 --> 00:36:12,443
but they have no respect for such a person,

453
00:36:13,343 --> 00:36:18,413
because they think self-respect is the biggest thing.

454
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:22,293
Can you imagine these poor people?

455
00:36:22,403 --> 00:36:26,323
They have food once a day,

456
00:36:26,423 --> 00:36:30,313
but to them their self-respect is above everything.

457
00:36:30,423 --> 00:36:36,393
So the third solution for this kind of a nonsensical greed is

458
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:40,433
your self-respect.

459
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:43,343
Why should you steal,

460
00:36:43,443 --> 00:36:46,273
why should you have anything that is stolen,

461
00:36:46,403 --> 00:36:48,393
or why should you have anything that belongs

462
00:36:49,233 --> 00:36:51,343
to another person?

463
00:36:52,263 --> 00:36:54,373
If you have that self-respect within you,

464
00:36:55,233 --> 00:37:00,283
you won’t touch anything that is not yours.

465
00:37:01,363 --> 00:37:04,413
When the servants can do that, why not people

466
00:37:05,273 --> 00:37:09,263
who are not that badly off?

467
00:37:09,373 --> 00:37:15,233
It is a temperament of a higher level, I think,

468
00:37:15,353 --> 00:37:18,253
which they develop, where their self-respect

469
00:37:18,373 --> 00:37:23,223
is much more important than all kinds of

470
00:37:23,323 --> 00:37:27,323
other things that may satisfy their greed.

471
00:37:27,433 --> 00:37:33,213
But one thing about greed is, it is never satisfied.

472
00:37:33,323 --> 00:37:36,203
It is never satisfied.

473
00:37:36,313 --> 00:37:39,203
I’ve seen people who were very rich once upon a time,

474
00:37:39,303 --> 00:37:41,393
became very, very poor.

475
00:37:42,283 --> 00:37:45,273
So to them life has become hell.

476
00:37:45,393 --> 00:37:51,253
They can’t live with, without their great,

477
00:37:52,363 --> 00:37:57,343
I should say, pomp and show,

478
00:37:58,213 --> 00:38:01,223
but they don’t understand that it was false.

479
00:38:01,373 --> 00:38:06,303
They just go on feeling extremely

480
00:38:07,313 --> 00:38:11,353
downtrodden when they lose their money.

481
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:16,353
Then there are people who want to have money;

482
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:23,203
they’ll do anything but get money.

483
00:38:23,323 --> 00:38:29,353
It’s a very funny thing, but also power is the same as that.

484
00:38:30,223 --> 00:38:32,353
If you have your own powers,

485
00:38:33,203 --> 00:38:35,363
you don’t hanker after these powers.

486
00:38:35,363 --> 00:38:37,433
But they want to have power because

487
00:38:38,273 --> 00:38:42,353
they want to have money, and they get power with money –

488
00:38:42,433 --> 00:38:44,323
can you imagine?

489
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:47,423
Where are human beings, at what level?

490
00:38:48,283 --> 00:38:51,243
At what level of evolution they are?

491
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:56,443
They are going round and round the circle of this money.

492
00:38:57,353 --> 00:39:00,393
This is Nabhi Chakra

493
00:39:01,253 --> 00:39:03,293
which has to improve,

494
00:39:03,373 --> 00:39:06,393
which gives you satisfaction.

495
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:10,223
If your Nabhi Chakra is satisfied,

496
00:39:10,323 --> 00:39:14,303
you have achieved the state of Kubera.

497
00:39:14,403 --> 00:39:18,203
That’s very important, to see

498
00:39:18,303 --> 00:39:22,433
that your Nabhi should be satisfied.

499
00:39:24,233 --> 00:39:27,273
There are so many other kinds of things we have,

500
00:39:27,393 --> 00:39:31,313
but I think now the worst is this greed.

501
00:39:31,423 --> 00:39:36,333
And this, if it is managed somehow or other,

502
00:39:36,423 --> 00:39:39,333
brought to its own level,

503
00:39:39,433 --> 00:39:43,283
then I think world will improve very much.

504
00:39:43,283 --> 00:39:45,213
May God bless you.
