00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.800
From the ancient times and for your information,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.520
the great [Vyasa] was the son of a fisherwoman,

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.400
the one who wrote Gita.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.560
And Valmiki who wrote Ramayana&nbsp;
was himself a fisherman.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.500
Then you know that Christ had&nbsp;
twelve fishermen as his disciples.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.160
If you’ve seen this place,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.000
how they are surrounded by beautiful nature,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.800
by these beautiful trees of coconuts,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.360
which represent the ‘shripala’, it is Sahasrara,

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.080
and it is very amazing that&nbsp;
no fruit will fall upon you.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.640
It does not fall even on an animal.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.160
They know when to fall down, it’s very surprising.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.120
People sleep under these trees;

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.920
nobody has been hit, so far.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.360
[Laughter]

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.640
So now we are in a beautiful surrounding.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.120
It is very conducive to our spiritual life

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.000
and to our meditative efforts.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:29.920
First of all, this makes you feel&nbsp;
extremely small and very big.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.240
When you look at these trees,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.080
and you look at the nature, and look at the sun,

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.760
you feel like you are one of them.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.040
When you look at the sea, you think,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:52.320
Now the little drop has become the sea.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.080
So this kind of beautiful feeling comes into you.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:07.152
And I wish you start your journey&nbsp;
with this nice dip in the Arabian sea.

00:02:07.152 --> 00:02:10.080
You can cleanse yourself completely

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.800
and feeling very happy and relaxed.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.520
I’m sorry we had to do all this tonight,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.520
though you have come after a long journey,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.720
but there is no other time when we can do it.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.400
So, you don’t mind keeping awake for a while.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.840
In England, even now, it’s evening time only.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:42.920
We have to give bandhan to our, other&nbsp;
Sahaja Yogis who are coming via Karachi,

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.600
I don’t know why they took that route.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.920
But whatever it is, give them a bandhan

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.160
and I hope they will be back soon.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.840
May God bless you.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.840
We have been able to get some mattresses,

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.080
or what you call the matts.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.280
We call them ‘gadies’.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.200
These are hands spun and woven,

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.000
‘khadi’ absolutely, purely ‘khadi’ things,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.720
made by villagers.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.200
And I hope you enjoy them.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.440
It’s a little present from Me, for your comfort.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.240
Then, I have another job:

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.840
we have all the saris for all the ladies here.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.640
Put them together.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.440
I didn’t know how to solve this&nbsp;
problem, it’s very difficult.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.600
Now it’s all numbered.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.440
But I don’t know if you people know your numbers.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.400
One or two, three persons have to come up

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.000
and see for themselves after taking these things,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.040
come up and take these saris and&nbsp;
arrange it for all the ladies.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:07.369
We have calculated, I think, we have to pay about

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.400
[Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi]

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.640
425 rupees for this.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.120
For the four saris and for&nbsp;
petticoats and for blouses,

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.680
I think it’s not too much.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.960
Now those ladies who have taken bigger ones

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:26.340
can return it for the men&nbsp;
and take the smaller ones.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.760
[Laughter]

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.840
Those who have taken the&nbsp;
bigger ones, please return it.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.160
I mean, if you are really very&nbsp;
tall, you can keep it also.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:43.640
For a tall lady, you need a big one.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:52.720
I hope you enjoy them.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:59.640
Fortunately, I found them and&nbsp;
luckily they were 300 in number.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.840
[Laughter]

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.760
You are all so very lucky.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.880
Everything is arranged for you.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:19.280
Beautiful colours, aren’t they? Beautiful.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.840
Now this sari business.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:29.640
We should have some ladies who can manage it.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.000
When the men start taking those things,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.320
the ladies can come up and can see for themselves.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.956
[Conversation in Marathi]

00:05:44.956 --> 00:05:59.877
Ah, better come up here.

00:05:59.876 --> 00:06:02.341
Call Alganesh, she is very good.

00:06:02.342 --> 00:06:08.475
Alganesh, are you there? Ruth, is she there?

00:06:08.475 --> 00:06:12.520
Now, just see, you have to&nbsp;
take the names of the people.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:18.227
Now take it. How can you read it?

00:06:18.227 --> 00:06:27.280
Just see the names, the names are there.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:40.382
Sahaja Yogini: From Spain, Angel Garcia …

00:06:40.382 --> 00:06:40.400
[Cut in the audio]

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.960
60% less for things like that, imagine!

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.160
And you are, you’re very lucky.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.140
When I have to buy something&nbsp;
for myself, it’s very expensive.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.720
[Laughter]

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.560
That’s what I say that, “It’s by&nbsp;
your mother’s grace that it works

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.520
but what about me?”

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:14.604
I have to live by your grace.

00:07:14.604 --> 00:07:14.622
[Cut in the audio]

00:07:14.622 --> 00:07:15.200
In Marathi, it is said that,

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.160
“The saints are for the salvation of the world”.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.160
And the other way round could be that,

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.360
“The world is for the salvation of the saints”.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.520
You can imagine the situation of the saints.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.978
[Laughter]

00:07:30.978 --> 00:07:33.603
[Cut in the audio]

00:07:33.603 --> 00:07:36.520
… and you can see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.760
also, and there are weddings.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.960
So, I want you all to know each other,

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:54.701
the names and everything.

00:07:54.701 --> 00:07:54.717
Go back to that.

00:07:54.717 --> 00:07:54.742
Sahaja Yogini: Athena …

00:07:54.742 --> 00:07:54.760
[Cut in the audio]

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.440
And some need not have the&nbsp;
second, the second three buses.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.280
The second part of the three&nbsp;
buses who came later on,

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.920
you can have your dinner now.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.060
And then good morning again!

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.520
[Laughter]

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.620
So, tomorrow, you can get&nbsp;
up at three [unsure] here,

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.040
whenever you feel like.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.640
You can go to the seashore

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.000
and about eleven o’clock, we’ll start the puja.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.480
You can have a bath in the&nbsp;
morning, in the seashore.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:29.440
At eleven o’clock, we’ll have the puja&nbsp;
when all the people are coming from Bombay.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.000
So, for all of you, we have got the stains.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.560
I think you have been allotted, and&nbsp;
you know where to stay and what to do.

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.280
And I think every time, you&nbsp;
must change your groups.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.880
Don’t sleep in the same group.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.600
Because we have a bad habit of&nbsp;
forming a group all the time,

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.080
clubbing together.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:57.960
So best thing is to sleep in&nbsp;
different tents every night,

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.440
or maybe every place.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:05.560
Now I have got your saris also,

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:09.720
which I’ll give it to you in&nbsp;
Pune, for your international puja,

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.200
for 12 countries.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.840
We are not going to do it the way we did before,

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.880
because then, there are more saris&nbsp;
than I am really trying to reduce them.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.880
So, it will be according to every country

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:28.720
and whatever puja falls in&nbsp;
that country, we’ll use that.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:41.905
Now the third thing is that&nbsp;
your [Conversation in Marathi].

00:09:41.905 --> 00:09:45.030
The Khadi Wale people have&nbsp;
come, for your kurta pyjamas.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:49.960
So if you want, you can – [Marathi].

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:54.520
If you want you can buy now, or&nbsp;
tomorrow morning, whatever it is.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:58.360
The people have brought kurta and pyjamas for you.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:03.200
Also, please give your measurements.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:08.640
If you want to have silk kurta&nbsp;
and pyjamas, whatever you want,

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.640
with your measurements, you need to ask

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:16.440
so that it will be ready for&nbsp;
Ganapatipule and for the weddings.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.200
So that, the measurement has to be given

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.360
and there are people who&nbsp;
are willing to do it for us.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:30.880
Also for the weddings, for the&nbsp;
ladies, it’s very difficult to say,

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.240
but those who are getting married will hardly,

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.200
will have hardly any time.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.760
And their saris will be&nbsp;
arriving in that Ganapatipule.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.720
Or if you can decide earlier, we&nbsp;
can arrange it somewhere else.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.360
But the blouses have to be stitched

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:59.240
and I don’t know how we are&nbsp;
going to manage all that.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:05.397
Huh? [Conversation in Marathi].

00:11:05.397 --> 00:11:08.640
We have to still decide who&nbsp;
are going to get married.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:13.760
But they have got saris for marriages.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.360
[Laughter]

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:28.160
Now anyone of you who thinks that&nbsp;
you can buy the sari this time,

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:33.960
or give the name or you like&nbsp;
the saris, can do it here.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.820
And if you don’t get married&nbsp;
this year, keep it for next year!

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:39.000
[Laughter]

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.120
I don’t know what to do, because&nbsp;
it’s such a jammed programme.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.640
But if you can now select the sari,

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:59.005
the advantage will be that&nbsp;
we can get a blouse for it.

00:11:59.005 --> 00:11:59.240
[Conversation in Marathi about the price].

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:05.305
Shri Mataji: Maximum?

00:12:05.305 --> 00:12:08.547
Sahaja Yogini: Maximum more than 1000.

00:12:08.547 --> 00:12:09.820
Shri Mataji: From 800.

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:13.467
Sahaja Yogini: From 800 to 1500.

00:12:13.467 --> 00:12:18.080
Shri Mataji: It is from 800 to 1000 to 1500.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.560
So if you think that you should&nbsp;
buy now, you can buy now.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.320
We can make the blouse also for you.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.000
Or else, on the wedding day, you&nbsp;
cannot have your blouse done.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:28.960
That’s the problem is.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:34.840
So, I leave it to you because&nbsp;
this is the situation.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:39.000
I also haven’t seen yet, those who&nbsp;
want to get married and all that.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.440
But I think you can buy and if&nbsp;
you don’t, but you like also,

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.596
it’s a good sari you can always wear it.

00:12:46.596 --> 00:12:48.520
And that’s all I can say.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.760
Because if the blouse has to be stitched,

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.800
our tailors are getting crazy&nbsp;
now, they don’t know what to do.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:55.880
[Laughter]

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.440
Now you have got numbers.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.320
All of you have got numbers&nbsp;
for your blouses and things?

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.240
You find out your number and you have to say,

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.320
“This is the number for this&nbsp;
sari”, so that it can be done.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:11.320
So, those who want to buy saris can buy.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:18.840
Then if you remember we were giving those&nbsp;
pearls set for 525 rupees, if you remember?

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.280
All the things we wear and all those things.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.400
They are also available now.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.200
Those who want to buy for themselves

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.160
or those men who want to buy or anything,

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.880
they have to be ready in Ganapatipule.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.560
They are not yet ready so they’ll come down there.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:40.200
That is 525 rupees for one&nbsp;
necklace and ear and the bangles

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:44.440
which is quite a cheap price&nbsp;
for the whole [unclear].

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.680
So for that, if you want,&nbsp;
you can deposit the money

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:54.876
or if you want, you can&nbsp;
later on buy in Ganapatipule.

00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:59.160
Now I have asked them to&nbsp;
bring 100 sets. One hundred.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:04.160
I don’t know how many of you&nbsp;
would like to buy. All right.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.360
So, whatever is possible, we’ve done,

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.480
and I hope you’ll enjoy your tour here.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.200
And in this Spartan living,

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.680
you enjoy the beauty of this country

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.400
and also the beauty of [unclear].

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:26.040
And please develop a temperament by which&nbsp;
you do not see too small, small things,

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:29.440
but think of higher things, because you are Yogis,

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.000
you are one with the Divine.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.720
And you have to think of that Divinity&nbsp;
within you, which has to manifest itself,

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:42.400
and you should not worry about&nbsp;
small, small things of comfort,

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:46.800
or small things that can worry you normally.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.720
Now you have become something above normal,

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:57.440
and that’s what we have to develop that habit&nbsp;
of just enjoying whatever is a disadvantage,

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.040
converting it into an advantage.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.800
Now here, I hope, you like this place very much.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.600
Then we are going to Nasik,

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:13.680
where, near a river, we will be camping ourselves.

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:17.720
It’s a river flowing, you can&nbsp;
have nice baths and things.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.880
Also then, from there, Sangam area, [unclear].

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.720
Then you are going to Pune, to&nbsp;
another very beautiful place

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:30.320
where there is lot of water for you&nbsp;
to swim and wonderful place that one.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.200
Like that, one after another, I&nbsp;
have tried to choose the best places

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.120
and of nature for you.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:42.520
Not so much as hotels and things, so&nbsp;
little discomfort does are not matter,

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:46.640
because to live in a tent is not so comfortable.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:55.320
I hope you will not make yourself&nbsp;
miserable for nothing at all.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:00.160
And enjoy every part of it,&nbsp;
enjoy every minute of it.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:06.120
We have tried to arrange whatever&nbsp;
is possible under the circumstances.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:14.200
And also, tomorrow the Sahaja Yogis from&nbsp;
Bombay want to give you some sort of a shawl,

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.280
which they will be bringing.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:19.800
So, I think they will give&nbsp;
you some shawls as presents.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:24.120
Anything else you need, let us&nbsp;
know and let these people know.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:29.560
We must give a hand to Ima and Umar, both of them,

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.040
who have done so much of work

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:38.560
in collecting these blouses and petticoats&nbsp;
and matching them and saris and everything.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.200
And we have to thank the [unclear] house,

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.320
which has given us such a big concession.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.600
So we must give also to, a hand to Vimal

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:58.840
who has done so much concession for us.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:06.960
[Applause]

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.280
Now she has brought saris for you,

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:14.000
those who want to buy for marriage, or otherwise,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.680
or those who want to buy say,&nbsp;
for their wives or in any way.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.640
She has brought saris.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.760
In case, if they fall short, she can get more.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.960
You can have a look at them and see for yourself.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.520
But I think her prices are very&nbsp;
reasonable and she has reduced them.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.160
She went all the way to&nbsp;
Benares to get saris for you.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:39.800
So, I think you will all&nbsp;
enjoy choosing the saris also.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.320
And now I’ll take your leave,&nbsp;
while these people are here,

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.960
and you can see that.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:59.356
Thank you very much.

00:17:59.356 --> 00:18:02.761
[Sahaja Yogini speaks in Marathi]

00:18:02.761 --> 00:18:04.722
