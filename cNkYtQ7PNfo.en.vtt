00:03:04.573 --> 00:03:11.120
Shri Mataji (in Hindi: Sorry I am late, my granddaughter is a little sick

00:03:11.122 --> 00:03:20.150
and I stayed back to make her better.)

00:03:22.124 --> 00:03:25.730
First I will speak in English and then in Hindi.

00:03:29.078 --> 00:03:39.628
Today we are going to worship Rajalakshmi,

00:03:40.716 --> 00:03:50.279
means the Goddess which rules the kings.

00:03:55.073 --> 00:04:01.709
It’s a very important thing today to understand

00:04:02.932 --> 00:04:07.435
that something has basically gone wrong

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:16.024
in the working of our political systems

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:30.231
and why the people have lost their sense of

00:04:33.002 --> 00:04:40.989
justice, fair play and the benevolence of the people.

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:48.864
Where have we gone wrong that this is being lost?

00:04:51.089 --> 00:05:02.027
It’s not only in India, it’s not only in Japan or in England

00:05:02.028 --> 00:05:11.091
or any other place where we think there is democracy.

00:05:20.551 --> 00:05:28.521
First and foremost thing is that all these countries,

00:05:28.721 --> 00:05:33.621
even those who have got their freedom,

00:05:33.621 --> 00:05:36.970
started following those countries

00:05:36.972 --> 00:05:41.990
which were supposed to be highty and mighty and very powerful

00:05:41.991 --> 00:05:49.427
– like America, like Russia, like China, England –

00:05:52.992 --> 00:05:59.165
without understanding how far they have reached

00:05:59.174 --> 00:06:05.684
in delivering the goods that they are supposed to do.

00:06:08.378 --> 00:06:13.027
In any case, in a country like England,

00:06:13.613 --> 00:06:18.293
you see the monarchy, the way it has been working,

00:06:18.433 --> 00:06:23.871
is shocking, absolutely shocking.

00:06:25.613 --> 00:06:34.160
The way they have acted towards their ministers, like Cromwell,

00:06:35.988 --> 00:06:43.790
you feel as if some primitive people are trying to manage something.

00:06:43.988 --> 00:06:48.251
And the kings so cruel, queens so cruel,

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.660
so character-less, so irresponsible.

00:06:53.675 --> 00:07:02.199
They had no character to be kings and queens.

00:07:06.191 --> 00:07:14.585
There was no surrendering to the Rajalakshmi principle of one’s being.

00:07:16.781 --> 00:07:20.269
Then of course, it became independent,

00:07:20.285 --> 00:07:26.418
and even now I find such stupid things they’re doing.

00:07:26.668 --> 00:07:34.658
Even in France the president has a keep,

00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:40.246
they run after money, little money here and there.

00:07:40.753 --> 00:07:48.088
There are people in every country who are really of very, very low level

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:56.938
and who are trying to look after the welfare of the people.

00:08:00.175 --> 00:08:03.090
Also if you read the history of Samurai

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:07.136
and all those people in Japan you are shocked.

00:08:07.138 --> 00:08:08.680
They thought no end of themselves,

00:08:08.682 --> 00:08:14.081
they had no connection with the public and the way they behaved.

00:08:13.848 --> 00:08:20.158
Then you go to the communist countries also the same sort of thing.

00:08:20.027 --> 00:08:25.681
There also those who came in power

00:08:25.683 --> 00:08:32.598
became really like despotic rulers.

00:08:32.598 --> 00:08:36.667
Then we have on the other side Mr. Hitler

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:40.595
who came, thinking no end of himself.

00:08:40.597 --> 00:08:46.996
Spain, as you know was ruined by Franco.

00:08:48.807 --> 00:08:53.808
One cannot understand how these people without any character,

00:08:53.902 --> 00:08:59.908
without any higher qualities than the rest of the people

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:03.417
can look after their well-being.

00:09:03.419 --> 00:09:07.051
It’s impossible!

00:09:12.199 --> 00:09:19.157
I should say in our own country we had great kings, very great,

00:09:19.157 --> 00:09:23.902
because our heritage is great

00:09:23.927 --> 00:09:29.597
and we had saints who really ruled the kings.

00:09:29.878 --> 00:09:38.098
Like Shivaji had a guru who was a great saint, everybody.

00:09:38.098 --> 00:09:40.958
Janaka had a guru.

00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:44.508
Everybody had a guru.

00:09:44.508 --> 00:09:47.088
Even Shri Rama had a guru.

00:09:47.088 --> 00:09:50.598
But they were real gurus!

00:09:50.598 --> 00:09:55.687
They were the people who really lived the life of saints,

00:09:55.687 --> 00:10:02.228
they were real saints, inside, outside.

00:10:02.228 --> 00:10:16.657
And the people also accepted the kings who had spiritual background.

00:10:16.657 --> 00:10:19.078
Those who respected spiritual people.

00:10:19.078 --> 00:10:28.138
So, the whole trend in this country was very, very different

00:10:28.138 --> 00:10:31.068
till sometime.

00:10:31.068 --> 00:10:39.428
I don’t know when the English came what happened to them.

00:10:39.428 --> 00:10:41.888
The majority of the people didn’t like

00:10:41.888 --> 00:10:48.948
the way the English were living, their style, their methods,

00:10:48.948 --> 00:10:51.557
they didn’t appreciate.

00:10:51.557 --> 00:10:56.078
But these king and queens of different states

00:10:56.078 --> 00:11:01.488
they started feeling that they are very sophisticated people

00:11:01.488 --> 00:11:04.328
and we should have their culture.

00:11:04.328 --> 00:11:08.338
And so many of these queens, modern ones,

00:11:08.338 --> 00:11:16.228
who smoke, who drink, tell Me that it was taught by their governess

00:11:16.228 --> 00:11:26.608
who came either from Sweden or from England or from Australia.

00:11:26.608 --> 00:11:29.588
And they picked up these things.

00:11:29.588 --> 00:11:33.338
Of course the men also thought that we are very backward, you see,

00:11:33.338 --> 00:11:36.318
that’s the idea they gave them, “You are very backward people,

00:11:36.318 --> 00:11:41.188
you don’t know how to smoke, you don’t know how to drink,

00:11:41.188 --> 00:11:44.098
you have no ballroom dancing,” this that.

00:11:44.098 --> 00:11:48.528
Even our military got corrupted with it.

00:11:48.528 --> 00:11:51.158
In the military

00:11:51.158 --> 00:11:54.158
is all English style things still going on.

00:11:54.158 --> 00:11:56.798
I don’t know when will they stop.

00:11:56.798 --> 00:11:59.658
They don’t know anything about our own country.

00:11:59.658 --> 00:12:02.628
They’ll know about England,

00:12:02.628 --> 00:12:06.288
and you ask them anything about England they’ll know.

00:12:06.288 --> 00:12:11.328
The whole education system came through English,

00:12:11.328 --> 00:12:18.358
but all about England and western life than about Indian life.

00:12:18.358 --> 00:12:24.248
Nobody ever cared for Indian things, you see.

00:12:24.248 --> 00:12:27.468
Even in medicine same thing happened.

00:12:27.468 --> 00:12:31.958
Nobody wanted to listen to any vaidya (ayurveda) or anyone.

00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:41.778
They thought “Oh, these are useless primitive people, backward!”

00:12:41.778 --> 00:12:45.918
So even one country, which was really, I should say,

00:12:45.918 --> 00:12:58.798
had spirituality ruling in the politics also went down like this.

00:12:58.798 --> 00:13:04.318
Before independence in this country, I remember,

00:13:04.318 --> 00:13:08.938
we had to fight the British,

00:13:08.938 --> 00:13:14.998
and what patriotism people had at that time.

00:13:14.998 --> 00:13:20.588
I remember once we had gone to see a hockey match,

00:13:20.588 --> 00:13:25.068
and My father always had a national flag on it,

00:13:25.068 --> 00:13:28.428
that time it was not national it was congress flag, in the car.

00:13:28.428 --> 00:13:31.988
So the soldiers came, they said, “Take down this flag!”

00:13:31.988 --> 00:13:35.138
So My driver got down he said,

00:13:35.138 --> 00:13:39.458
“You cut my throat first and then you take down the flag!”.

00:13:39.458 --> 00:13:50.848
We all children joined him and they were shocked, went back.

00:13:50.848 --> 00:13:56.288
Such enthusiasm, such patriotism came at that time

00:13:56.288 --> 00:14:05.968
when we were fighting these people.

00:14:05.968 --> 00:14:09.488
But they divided us and created a problem for us.

00:14:09.488 --> 00:14:15.648
And you know before we could enjoy any fruits of our freedom,

00:14:15.648 --> 00:14:23.218
we were fighting, we were divided.

00:14:23.218 --> 00:14:27.758
I don’t know whom to blame for that.

00:14:27.758 --> 00:14:31.108
If we had not accepted this division,

00:14:31.108 --> 00:14:35.968
there would have been no problem.

00:14:35.968 --> 00:14:37.178
But they accepted it.

00:14:37.178 --> 00:14:40.738
Now, poor Bangladeshi’s are so, so, so poor.

00:14:40.738 --> 00:14:48.368
If they were one with India, they would have been much better.

00:14:48.368 --> 00:14:49.448
And what is Pakistan?

00:14:49.448 --> 00:14:52.218
It’s just an empty place, you know,

00:14:52.218 --> 00:14:54.068
no industries, nothing.

00:14:54.068 --> 00:14:58.558
That’s why they are all the time talking about Kashmir, Kashmir.

00:14:58.558 --> 00:14:59.988
They have nothing else!

00:14:59.988 --> 00:15:06.858
[In] their own country people are having fights, this that, but there’s no growth.

00:15:06.858 --> 00:15:10.558
Now they cut out only this India.

00:15:10.558 --> 00:15:21.808
Now here, after all this happening, you know, any war,

00:15:21.808 --> 00:15:29.078
any kind of crisis like that, immediately changes the value system.

00:15:29.078 --> 00:15:32.868
Not that in the West there were no value systems, there were,

00:15:32.868 --> 00:15:40.898
but the war completely changed them in the same way in India also.

00:15:40.898 --> 00:15:46.478
Politicians, those who lost their lives in the fights,

00:15:46.478 --> 00:15:55.088
or those who stood for something good were regarded as no ideal.

00:15:55.088 --> 00:15:59.958
And people took a U-turn, absolutely a U-turn

00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:03.758
and they became very self-centred,

00:16:03.758 --> 00:16:07.998
only worried about their own personal things, their families,

00:16:07.998 --> 00:16:14.788
or maybe accumulation of money and

00:16:14.788 --> 00:16:17.408
transferring of money from here to Switzerland.

00:16:17.408 --> 00:16:22.448
I mean something, I mean I tell you I’ve gone through My life

00:16:22.448 --> 00:16:27.478
with the people who were fighting, fighting for freedom.

00:16:27.478 --> 00:16:33.938
I mean they could not even think of these things.

00:16:33.938 --> 00:16:37.578
I know My father, I know My mother, I know their friends,

00:16:37.578 --> 00:16:42.778
I know so many people who were in our family used to come,

00:16:42.778 --> 00:16:49.048
so many Sikhs and so many other people, Muslims even.

00:16:49.048 --> 00:16:55.148
They could not think of taking any money,

00:16:55.148 --> 00:17:01.478
I mean it was really regarded as very low-level.

00:17:01.478 --> 00:17:10.868
For what to take?

00:17:10.868 --> 00:17:15.188
What is the need?

00:17:15.188 --> 00:17:20.898
If you are satisfied in your heart of what you wanted, you got,

00:17:20.898 --> 00:17:23.988
you’ve got your freedom, now finished.

00:17:23.988 --> 00:17:29.648
But how these people who were absolutely at the bottom,

00:17:29.648 --> 00:17:33.308
who did nothing for the country,

00:17:33.308 --> 00:17:36.348
sacrificed nothing for the country,

00:17:36.348 --> 00:17:45.358
just came up on top and all the good people went down.

00:17:45.358 --> 00:17:52.928
If you read the history of Shivaji,

00:17:52.928 --> 00:17:58.058
or Rana Pratap, or any of them, Shalivahana, anyone,

00:17:58.058 --> 00:18:04.988
you’ll be surprised how they used to worship Shakti.

00:18:04.988 --> 00:18:10.908
All the Kshatriyas used to worship Shakti,

00:18:10.908 --> 00:18:14.798
and they would go up to a point and not beyond.

00:18:14.798 --> 00:18:18.938
Up to the point till the dharma was there.

00:18:18.938 --> 00:18:22.448
That history I cannot repeat it to you.

00:18:22.448 --> 00:18:29.558
But in the subtle way, one feels that

00:18:29.558 --> 00:18:36.968
this partition suddenly changed the attitude of people,

00:18:36.968 --> 00:18:44.568
or I should say those who were very low-level they came up.

00:18:44.568 --> 00:18:51.268
I remember I was here at that time, partition time,

00:18:51.268 --> 00:19:01.078
and I was married and three people came to Me.

00:19:01.078 --> 00:19:04.218
I was sitting outside in the garden,

00:19:04.218 --> 00:19:06.998
knitting something for My child because I was pregnant.

00:19:06.998 --> 00:19:12.828
So they came, and they looked at Me and they said,

00:19:12.828 --> 00:19:18.828
“Can we have one room in your house?”

00:19:18.828 --> 00:19:21.128
I said, “Why not, I’ve got it.

00:19:21.128 --> 00:19:23.728
It’s a very big house of My father.

00:19:23.728 --> 00:19:28.238
I’ll give it to you.”

00:19:28.238 --> 00:19:32.548
They said, “We need for one or two months.

00:19:32.548 --> 00:19:33.548
We are refugees.”

00:19:33.548 --> 00:19:34.548
I said “Alright, and it has an outside door,

00:19:34.548 --> 00:19:37.628
you need not bother us and there’s also kitchen attached

00:19:37.628 --> 00:19:38.928
and a bathroom attached.

00:19:38.928 --> 00:19:41.717
You can do whatever you like.”

00:19:41.717 --> 00:19:44.598
Just I offered.

00:19:44.598 --> 00:19:49.808
In the evening My brother came, elder brother, and My husband

00:19:49.808 --> 00:19:56.658
and both of them were friends and he just started shouting at Me.

00:19:56.658 --> 00:19:58.098
These people were in the other room.

00:19:58.098 --> 00:20:00.758
“What do you mean by keeping such people?

00:20:00.758 --> 00:20:01.758
Who are they?

00:20:01.758 --> 00:20:04.298
What will they do?” and this and that.

00:20:04.298 --> 00:20:08.078
I said, “What will they do?”

00:20:08.078 --> 00:20:10.338
“They may steal something from me!”

00:20:10.338 --> 00:20:13.648
“So what is there in this house to steal?

00:20:13.648 --> 00:20:19.708
They are refugees, look nice people to Me.

00:20:19.708 --> 00:20:23.658
I have approved them because of vibrations they’re alright.”

00:20:23.658 --> 00:20:27.248
“No, no, no, no, no better throw them away!”

00:20:27.248 --> 00:20:31.468
I said, Look at these people [my husband and brother],

00:20:31.468 --> 00:20:35.698
“Without even talking to them, knowing them, suddenly

00:20:35.698 --> 00:20:43.778
you are asking them to get out only because they are refugees.”

00:20:43.778 --> 00:20:49.148
Then I did feel that in this country a new wave had started,

00:20:49.148 --> 00:20:55.238
that a person is not respected if he has no money,

00:20:55.238 --> 00:20:59.568
he’s not trusted if you have no money.

00:20:59.568 --> 00:21:02.008
Actually it is the other way round,

00:21:02.008 --> 00:21:05.598
those who have money, you better never trust them.

00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:09.148
And those who don’t have money are much more honest people

00:21:09.148 --> 00:21:12.498
in this country than the people who have money,

00:21:12.498 --> 00:21:18.338
who are all cheats practically.

00:21:18.338 --> 00:21:21.608
So it happened like this and I said,

00:21:21.608 --> 00:21:23.548
“No they are going to stay here!”

00:21:23.548 --> 00:21:26.198
I put down My foot.

00:21:26.198 --> 00:21:31.298
I said, “This house My father has given Me

00:21:31.298 --> 00:21:33.658
and they are going to stay here.”

00:21:33.658 --> 00:21:40.868
Poor things they stayed for a month in a very,

00:21:40.868 --> 00:21:45.968
I think, must be very much embarrassed.

00:21:45.968 --> 00:21:51.078
And while they were there so many Sikhs,

00:21:51.078 --> 00:21:55.808
that time it was a big organisation – Sikhs and RSS were one,

00:21:55.808 --> 00:21:58.498
and they came to My house and said,

00:21:58.498 --> 00:22:00.928
“We’ve heard there’s a Muslim staying with you.”

00:22:00.928 --> 00:22:02.328
There was a Muslim.

00:22:02.328 --> 00:22:05.558
“And we’re going to kill that Muslim.”

00:22:05.558 --> 00:22:10.338
I said, “What makes you think there’s a Muslim?”

00:22:10.338 --> 00:22:11.938
“We’ve got reports.”

00:22:11.938 --> 00:22:16.718
I said, “Wrong, there’s no Muslim in the house.”

00:22:16.718 --> 00:22:22.568
I told him a lie.

00:22:22.568 --> 00:22:26.478
So they said, “How are we to believe you?”

00:22:26.478 --> 00:22:30.068
I said, “See I’m wearing a thing (bindi).

00:22:30.068 --> 00:22:31.928
I am a Hindu lady.

00:22:31.928 --> 00:22:33.818
How will I keep a Muslim in my house?

00:22:33.818 --> 00:22:40.788
We’re all frightened of them and there’s no one like that.”

00:22:40.788 --> 00:22:43.128
Somehow or other they believed Me.

00:22:43.128 --> 00:22:47.308
I told a complete lie but they believed Me.

00:22:47.308 --> 00:22:55.848
They had brought lots of those swords, with blood.

00:22:55.848 --> 00:23:05.758
But I was not afraid and I told them in a very determined manner.

00:23:05.758 --> 00:23:08.368
Anybody else in My place would have said,

00:23:08.368 --> 00:23:17.288
“Alright, alright there is one you can take away.”

00:23:17.288 --> 00:23:23.568
Then these three persons, who were there, left My house

00:23:23.568 --> 00:23:29.118
and one of them is a very famous actress,

00:23:29.118 --> 00:23:32.288
another one is a very famous poet

00:23:32.288 --> 00:23:36.038
and another one is a very, very famous writer.

00:23:36.038 --> 00:23:39.388
And it so happened that

00:23:39.388 --> 00:23:45.298
they (a charitable organisation) wanted to make a film about young people

00:23:45.298 --> 00:23:51.368
and I was the chairman of that, vice chairman of that,

00:23:51.368 --> 00:23:53.538
and they wanted to call this actress.

00:23:53.538 --> 00:23:56.978
I said, “Don’t tell her My name.”

00:23:56.978 --> 00:24:00.208
Because I had lost her completely.

00:24:00.208 --> 00:24:03.768
I’d just said let it be wherever they are, let them be.

00:24:03.768 --> 00:24:06.688
There’s no, sort of, I never made any enquiries or anything.

00:24:06.688 --> 00:24:07.918
“Don’t tell them My name.”

00:24:07.918 --> 00:24:08.918
They said “Why?”

00:24:08.918 --> 00:24:17.378
I said, “For some reason you just don’t tell her My name,

00:24:17.378 --> 00:24:20.658
otherwise she’ll be compelled to say yes, which I don’t want.”

00:24:20.658 --> 00:24:23.868
So when they went to her and asked her,

00:24:23.868 --> 00:24:28.148
she said, “I must get a sari, I must get a chappal,

00:24:28.148 --> 00:24:31.578
I must get a purse to match, I must get this,

00:24:31.578 --> 00:24:34.288
all this you have to pay, plus so much money you’ll have to pay.”

00:24:34.288 --> 00:24:36.448
They said, “Ours is a charitable.”

00:24:36.448 --> 00:24:38.978
She said, “Whatever it is.”

00:24:38.978 --> 00:24:43.538
I said, “Alright, give her whatever she asks for.”

00:24:43.538 --> 00:24:49.378
Then I went for the opening ceremony and she saw Me

00:24:49.378 --> 00:24:54.588
and she couldn’t control herself, tears started rolling down her.

00:24:54.588 --> 00:24:56.658
Just came and fell at My feet.

00:24:56.658 --> 00:25:02.578
She said, “How are you here after such a long time?”

00:25:02.578 --> 00:25:06.648
So they said, “She’s the one who’s making this film.”

00:25:06.648 --> 00:25:07.648
“What?

00:25:07.648 --> 00:25:14.128
She’s making this film, why didn’t you tell me?

00:25:14.128 --> 00:25:15.128
My God, my God.”

00:25:15.128 --> 00:25:18.158
She couldn’t help it, she was crying, crying, crying, crying.

00:25:18.158 --> 00:25:19.708
I said, “Now it’s alright.”

00:25:19.708 --> 00:25:21.928
She said, “You take money from me.

00:25:21.928 --> 00:25:24.528
I’ll pay for the whole making of the film.

00:25:24.528 --> 00:25:26.268
You don’t know this lady.

00:25:26.268 --> 00:25:27.658
You don’t know her.

00:25:27.658 --> 00:25:32.078
What She’s done for me, nobody would do [what] she had done.”

00:25:32.078 --> 00:25:38.498
She said, “She never told us anything how are we to know?”

00:25:38.498 --> 00:25:42.148
Such a change that she, immediately she telephoned to her husband

00:25:42.148 --> 00:25:46.148
and to this great poet, they all came running and they all…

00:25:46.148 --> 00:25:53.888
But a small good gesture of administration:

00:25:53.888 --> 00:26:00.338
that was My house given to Me by My father.

00:26:00.338 --> 00:26:04.108
That time of course My husband and My brother

00:26:04.108 --> 00:26:11.988
didn’t know how to trust people.

00:26:11.988 --> 00:26:14.378
But I trusted them, fully.

00:26:14.378 --> 00:26:19.758
They were saying, “They will cut your throat.”

00:26:19.758 --> 00:26:20.758
“Why?

00:26:20.758 --> 00:26:23.068
Why will they cut My throat?

00:26:23.068 --> 00:26:26.248
For what?”

00:26:26.248 --> 00:26:28.848
All kinds of funny things they were thinking.

00:26:28.848 --> 00:26:32.048
And the worst thing I felt was

00:26:32.048 --> 00:26:39.768
they were afraid because they had no money.

00:26:39.768 --> 00:26:44.898
That is the beginning of the end, I think.

00:26:44.898 --> 00:26:51.328
In our country this struggle for money started after that.

00:26:51.328 --> 00:26:56.288
Without money people started suffering very much.

00:26:56.288 --> 00:27:00.158
Poor people don’t mind because they are used to it.

00:27:00.158 --> 00:27:04.898
Whatever money they have, they eat it and sleep off.

00:27:04.898 --> 00:27:09.718
There were not also very, very poor people as they are today

00:27:09.718 --> 00:27:12.848
but they were poor people no doubt.

00:27:12.848 --> 00:27:16.888
But what I realised at that moment,

00:27:16.888 --> 00:27:23.048
that the people who have any position or any power or anything

00:27:23.048 --> 00:27:31.808
are literally frightened of everybody else.

00:27:31.808 --> 00:27:36.458
This is the beginning of our downfall.

00:27:36.458 --> 00:27:42.258
We got frightened.

00:27:42.258 --> 00:27:46.348
Those who were in charge got frightened

00:27:46.348 --> 00:27:55.558
that I may lose my seat or I may lose my money, I may lose my power.

00:27:55.558 --> 00:28:00.888
That fright kept them absolutely mad.

00:28:00.888 --> 00:28:06.938
Supposing I am left with no money.

00:28:06.938 --> 00:28:08.668
So what?

00:28:08.668 --> 00:28:10.398
What happens?

00:28:10.398 --> 00:28:17.408
All these thoughts started coming after that partition, I felt it’s everywhere.

00:28:17.408 --> 00:28:22.628
While I’ll tell you in My childhood,

00:28:22.628 --> 00:28:25.358
My father never used to lock the house, it was a very big house

00:28:25.358 --> 00:28:27.598
he never use to lock.

00:28:27.598 --> 00:28:29.618
And we had a very beautiful gramophone

00:28:29.618 --> 00:28:33.798
will all that horn sort of a thing.

00:28:33.798 --> 00:28:40.718
And one day one thief came and stole that.

00:28:40.718 --> 00:28:45.648
So next day we discovered, My father said,

00:28:45.648 --> 00:28:50.228
“Poor thing, he was fond of music so he’s taken away doesn’t matter,

00:28:50.228 --> 00:28:54.068
but he didn’t take the records now what will he use,

00:28:54.068 --> 00:28:56.628
he must have records.”

00:28:56.628 --> 00:28:58.279
So My Mother started teasing him,

00:28:58.279 --> 00:29:00.408
“Alright you advertise now.

00:29:00.408 --> 00:29:03.528
The one who has stolen our gramophone

00:29:03.528 --> 00:29:08.518
should come and take the records they are available for him.”

00:29:08.518 --> 00:29:11.758
It’s so natural you know.

00:29:11.758 --> 00:29:14.938
He just felt [that] we have money after all,

00:29:14.938 --> 00:29:17.398
this fellow doesn’t have money

00:29:17.398 --> 00:29:24.038
and he wants to listen to music you see.

00:29:24.038 --> 00:29:26.958
So My father said, ‘Alright’.

00:29:26.958 --> 00:29:28.438
Otherwise he was a criminal lawyer

00:29:28.438 --> 00:29:31.628
My father knew law very well.

00:29:31.628 --> 00:29:34.408
Was not a stupid fool

00:29:34.408 --> 00:29:40.358
but he couldn’t understand this fellow has only taken gramophone only

00:29:40.358 --> 00:29:41.638
without the records.

00:29:41.638 --> 00:29:42.638
He said,

00:29:42.638 --> 00:29:46.848
“he must not have found it, you see it was there kept and all that.”

00:29:46.848 --> 00:29:53.508
My Mother said, “You better advertise it.”

00:29:53.508 --> 00:29:57.458
He was a politician also.

00:29:57.458 --> 00:30:03.908
So that time, the feeling among the politician was to

00:30:03.908 --> 00:30:07.908
how to raise the standard of these people

00:30:07.908 --> 00:30:16.827
who are not having what we are having.

00:30:16.827 --> 00:30:25.338
All the people who had money donated lavishly to so many things.

00:30:25.338 --> 00:30:30.248
I mean in My place there was one Rahbahadur Lakshminarayan,

00:30:30.248 --> 00:30:37.798
he donated all his money, everything, to a big university.

00:30:37.798 --> 00:30:41.098
Most of the things that happened in those days

00:30:41.098 --> 00:30:45.328
were done by charity people.

00:30:45.328 --> 00:30:48.668
I mean they never thought our children should have so much money,

00:30:48.668 --> 00:30:51.388
crores and crores and crores.

00:30:51.388 --> 00:30:54.118
They never thought like that.

00:30:54.118 --> 00:31:00.128
Whatever limited money they had they wanted to donate

00:31:00.128 --> 00:31:03.018
and do something good for others.

00:31:03.018 --> 00:31:09.528
So when the Rajalakshmi, Lakshmi that is the one responsible

00:31:09.528 --> 00:31:14.248
for looking after the benevolence of the people,

00:31:14.248 --> 00:31:20.478
when She acts people think that they have,

00:31:20.478 --> 00:31:23.968
not even think, they do it, automatically,

00:31:23.968 --> 00:31:28.538
that they are there for benevolence.

00:31:28.538 --> 00:31:31.548
They don’t have to tell themselves,

00:31:31.548 --> 00:31:37.358
it’s just that they feel that it is their job,

00:31:37.358 --> 00:31:41.158
this is what they have to do, is to look after the people

00:31:41.158 --> 00:31:46.208
they are to be brought to better levels of life.

00:31:46.208 --> 00:31:52.778
This is what they think, they don’t think like a party politics,

00:31:52.778 --> 00:32:02.858
who is coming up, whom to kill, nothing of the kind!

00:32:02.858 --> 00:32:06.708
Under the influence of the Goddess of Lakshmi,

00:32:06.708 --> 00:32:16.688
which rules the political side we can say, the kingdoms and all that

00:32:16.688 --> 00:32:24.148
– first thing is generosity, first thing is generosity.

00:32:24.148 --> 00:32:32.048
For example, Mahavira was meditating and while coming out His cloth

00:32:32.048 --> 00:32:35.838
– He had one cloth around His body, dhoti and He had covered himself.

00:32:35.838 --> 00:32:44.258
And the upper cloth just got caught up in the bushes.

00:32:44.258 --> 00:32:46.648
So he cut it out and came out with half the cloth

00:32:46.648 --> 00:32:49.438
– it was in His own palace.

00:32:49.438 --> 00:32:54.608
So Shri Krishna wanted to take His test.

00:32:54.608 --> 00:32:59.498
He said, “See I have no clothes, I’m just naked.”

00:32:59.498 --> 00:33:03.128
He came before Him like a beggar.

00:33:03.128 --> 00:33:06.728
“You have this, why don’t you give Me this cloth?

00:33:06.728 --> 00:33:09.818
You can go to your palace and wear your dress.”

00:33:09.818 --> 00:33:11.038
He said, “Alright.”

00:33:11.038 --> 00:33:17.748
He took it out and gave it to him.

00:33:17.748 --> 00:33:21.558
And then He got some leaves and all that, covered Himself,

00:33:21.558 --> 00:33:23.548
went to His palace and got dressed.

00:33:23.548 --> 00:33:30.628
But now these Jains, you know, they make His statue so big,

00:33:30.628 --> 00:33:32.498
insult Him completely

00:33:32.498 --> 00:33:46.368
by showing all kinds of nonsensical private parts to the details.

00:33:46.368 --> 00:33:55.447
This is what is, where you have no worshipping of the Goddess.

00:33:55.447 --> 00:33:57.858
Goddess is Shri Shobha!

00:33:57.858 --> 00:34:02.688
She’s the One who decorates you.

00:34:02.688 --> 00:34:06.088
She’s a mother.

00:34:06.088 --> 00:34:07.678
She decorates you with ornaments,

00:34:07.678 --> 00:34:10.728
She decorates you with beautiful clothes, She’s your mother.

00:34:10.728 --> 00:34:13.908
She does it!

00:34:13.908 --> 00:34:21.178
Like, Raja Janaka, He was the king so

00:34:21.178 --> 00:34:29.317
He had to wear ornaments, He had to wear beautiful clothes,

00:34:29.317 --> 00:34:30.868
He had to do everything.

00:34:30.868 --> 00:34:31.868
And when Nachiketa went to Him

00:34:31.868 --> 00:34:36.148
he was quite surprised that why my guru has sent him to this king

00:34:36.148 --> 00:34:39.518
who is wearing all kind of dresses and this and that and

00:34:39.518 --> 00:34:43.268
he also had a big function of dancing and this.

00:34:43.268 --> 00:34:49.098
He said, “He’s not a saint so why my guru touches His feet?

00:34:49.098 --> 00:34:54.028
He’s a king.”

00:34:54.028 --> 00:35:01.908
Of course Raja Janaka knew what he was thinking about.

00:35:01.908 --> 00:35:04.118
He said, “Why have you come here Nachiketa?”

00:35:04.118 --> 00:35:07.768
He said, “I’m here to get my Self-realisation.”

00:35:07.768 --> 00:35:12.128
He said, “You can take all My kingdom

00:35:12.128 --> 00:35:15.718
but not easy to give you Self-realisation.”

00:35:15.718 --> 00:35:22.728
He said, “Alright, whatever you say I’ll do.”

00:35:22.728 --> 00:35:30.868
So He put a big sword on his head and asked him to sleep.

00:35:30.868 --> 00:35:36.798
He couldn’t sleep at all.

00:35:36.798 --> 00:35:38.258
Then they were having a bath,

00:35:38.258 --> 00:35:40.938
he said, “Come and have bath in the river.”

00:35:40.938 --> 00:35:47.258
People came and told that there’s fire and everybody’s running away

00:35:47.258 --> 00:35:49.348
and Raja Janaka was in His meditative mood,

00:35:49.348 --> 00:35:52.048
He was just sitting quietly.

00:35:52.048 --> 00:35:54.748
Nachiketa got a little upset.

00:35:54.748 --> 00:35:57.058
Then they said, “The fire is coming here

00:35:57.058 --> 00:35:59.827
and all these cloths are going to be burnt.”

00:35:59.827 --> 00:36:10.158
So Nachiketa ran out to save his things but still He was meditating.

00:36:10.158 --> 00:36:14.978
Then they came out and Nachiketa found

00:36:14.978 --> 00:36:18.447
that nothing that was burnt was there.

00:36:18.447 --> 00:36:22.378
It was just an illusion for people.

00:36:22.378 --> 00:36:27.408
He was amazed.

00:36:27.408 --> 00:36:31.947
Then he realised what was wrong with him,

00:36:31.947 --> 00:36:37.798
that he was doubting the Divine power Itself.

00:36:37.798 --> 00:36:43.058
The one who was Janaka, who was a king,

00:36:43.058 --> 00:36:47.008
was not bothered about His own powers, these are what?

00:36:47.008 --> 00:36:50.038
Because he is today, this you have to do it.

00:36:50.038 --> 00:36:54.488
Because I’m married, I have to wear a mangalsutra.

00:36:54.488 --> 00:36:59.308
So this is for the parampara, for the tradition style,

00:36:59.308 --> 00:37:15.268
but inside He was a saint, a very high…high level of saintliness.

00:37:15.268 --> 00:37:26.068
When this thing happens that you get some position,

00:37:26.068 --> 00:37:30.768
any power, even in Sahaja Yoga I was surprised.

00:37:30.768 --> 00:37:38.398
If somebody becomes leader, I don’t know what happens to him.

00:37:38.398 --> 00:37:39.398
It is a myth.

00:37:39.398 --> 00:37:42.248
There’s nothing like leadership in Sahaja Yoga, nothing like that.

00:37:42.248 --> 00:37:45.828
It’s just a myth.

00:37:45.828 --> 00:37:53.498
But suddenly people jump up.

00:37:53.498 --> 00:37:59.887
It is ego that gets pampered.

00:37:59.887 --> 00:38:09.398
But this ego can be easily managed if you worship the Rajalakshmi.

00:38:09.398 --> 00:38:13.008
She is the giver of balance.

00:38:13.008 --> 00:38:27.768
Firstly, She rides on the elephant.

00:38:27.768 --> 00:38:31.428
Is not easy for a lady to climb on an elephant,

00:38:31.428 --> 00:38:36.618
I have done it, it’s not easy.

00:38:36.618 --> 00:38:39.248
Without fear.

00:38:39.248 --> 00:38:52.368
And She sits straight with a complete balanced attitude.

00:38:52.368 --> 00:38:57.688
And Her blessings are tremendous.

00:38:57.688 --> 00:39:13.008
The first blessing one gets: the imbibement of dignity.

00:39:13.008 --> 00:39:18.468
Dignity of a king, dignity of a queen.

00:39:18.468 --> 00:39:26.988
You are a queen, so you can’t behave like street women.

00:39:26.988 --> 00:39:37.168
With Her blessing, first of all, you get that dignity.

00:39:37.168 --> 00:39:46.648
That dignity is full of love, love for others.

00:39:46.648 --> 00:39:49.038
That personality emits nothing

00:39:49.038 --> 00:39:56.098
but love and benevolence for others, nothing else.

00:39:56.098 --> 00:40:04.448
Wherever She looks, in every glance She blesses people.

00:40:04.448 --> 00:40:07.458
She doesn’t expect anything.

00:40:07.458 --> 00:40:12.828
She is a queen, what can you give to the queen?

00:40:12.828 --> 00:40:17.388
She’s the highest of all in every way,

00:40:17.388 --> 00:40:19.058
what can you give it to Her?

00:40:19.058 --> 00:40:23.318
These, all these politicians and all these so-called presidents

00:40:23.318 --> 00:40:24.538
of all these countries are beggars.

00:40:24.538 --> 00:40:31.678
All the time give me this, give me this,

00:40:31.678 --> 00:40:35.078
like greedy people going around are beggars!

00:40:35.078 --> 00:40:42.518
They are not the people who can rule.

00:40:42.518 --> 00:40:48.948
Hankering after things.

00:40:48.948 --> 00:40:55.568
So first thing is the sign, is that such a person has a personality

00:40:55.568 --> 00:41:02.637
that just blesses people, thinks of their benevolence,

00:41:02.637 --> 00:41:08.558
cares for each and every person who comes along.

00:41:08.558 --> 00:41:18.258
This is a blessing of the Goddess.

00:41:18.258 --> 00:41:22.598
Then the second blessing of the Goddess

00:41:22.598 --> 00:41:29.258
is that you develop a kind of a temperament,

00:41:29.258 --> 00:41:38.188
which is very dignified, but also very humorous

00:41:38.188 --> 00:41:44.328
and understanding what other people are like.

00:41:48.958 --> 00:41:54.568
There’s a story of a king who was going on a horse

00:41:54.568 --> 00:41:55.698
and he met a drunkard.

00:41:55.698 --> 00:41:58.048
So you can say

00:41:58.048 --> 00:42:02.788
these our drunkard can be compared to our politicians.

00:42:02.788 --> 00:42:06.288
So the drunkard stopped.

00:42:06.288 --> 00:42:10.178
He said, “I want to buy your horse.”

00:42:10.178 --> 00:42:12.778
People said, “Do you know what he is?”

00:42:12.778 --> 00:42:14.588
“Yeah I know he’s a king.

00:42:14.588 --> 00:42:15.588
Alright.

00:42:15.588 --> 00:42:16.588
So what?

00:42:16.588 --> 00:42:17.588
I want to buy his horse.”

00:42:17.588 --> 00:42:22.768
He said, “Alright not today, tomorrow we’ll sell the horse to you.”

00:42:22.768 --> 00:42:23.828
So went away.

00:42:23.828 --> 00:42:25.598
Next day he was called.

00:42:25.598 --> 00:42:29.578
So he came with folded hands bent down.

00:42:29.578 --> 00:42:34.758
He said, “What, you were the one who was going to buy my horse,

00:42:34.758 --> 00:42:36.458
what has happened to you?

00:42:36.458 --> 00:42:39.908
I want to sell it to you.”

00:42:39.908 --> 00:42:48.298
He said, “Sir, the one who wanted to buy is dead.

00:42:48.298 --> 00:42:51.028
I am an ordinary person.”

00:42:51.028 --> 00:43:12.168
Such a personality, such solid personality I should say,

00:43:12.168 --> 00:43:15.648
that anybody would have been angry, would have said

00:43:15.648 --> 00:43:16.688
“Beat this man!

00:43:16.688 --> 00:43:17.718
Throw him away!

00:43:17.718 --> 00:43:19.468
He talks to me like this,

00:43:19.468 --> 00:43:24.644
behaves like this.”

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:30.300
What the king said was remarkable.

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:39.189
Because he knew he’s drunk, he knew he’s not in his senses,

00:43:39.189 --> 00:43:44.110
that’s why he’s talking.

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:46.070
Didn’t get angry with him,

00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:49.110
he said, “Alright, come along tomorrow, I’ll sell you the horse.”

00:43:49.110 --> 00:43:53.140
That’s only possible if you have this Rajalakshmi in you

00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:56.710
otherwise you would never behave like this.

00:43:56.710 --> 00:44:03.000
Now what about today’s politicians anywhere?

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.990
They even shoot people, they kill people,

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:09.280
they arrest them,they put them into trouble I mean,

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:22.910
all kinds of things they are doing.

00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:30.230
Such people have no right to call anybody as criminals!

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:32.950
But we accept!

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:37.699
As in Hindi we say, “Aaj kal ka zamana hai aisa.”

00:44:37.699 --> 00:44:39.520
(Such is todays world)

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:48.410
We accept it – all such people as our rulers.

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:55.760
Then Rajalakshmi is the one who stands on dharma.

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.790
She stands on dharma.

00:44:57.790 --> 00:45:10.210
If there is some adharmi then she will not bless that person.

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:18.110
Adharmi is to be taken out.

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:30.650
But if he’s not, then he will go all out to save that person.

00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:38.220
But if he finds he’s adharmi, he will not.

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:45.610
Is a kind of a divine discretion he should have

00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:53.670
as to whom to be kind and whom to be punishing.

00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:59.820
That divine discretion should be there in a person,

00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:03.110
otherwise you can play into the hands of ten people

00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:14.000
who are around you, teaching you something, doing something.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:20.740
One day I was in My mother’s place Nandgaon,

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:25.700
and there was one gentleman who impressed our Yogi very much.

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:27.320
I just kept quiet.

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:36.070
He was a big politician and he told Me,

00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:40.500
“We have to do like this and we have to do.”

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:42.360
I said, “Alright, alright, alright.”

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:48.470
Then three, four professors from the university came to tell Me,

00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:52.260
“Mother, he’s a politician, be very careful.

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:55.880
He’s a very bad man, you be careful about him.”

00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:58.300
I said, “What do you know about him?”

00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:00.170
They said, “He’s a politician.”

00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:02.070
I said, “There are so many politicians.”

00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:03.690
“But he’s not a good man.”

00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:05.870
“But what do you mean?”

00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:08.590
I said, “Now you sit down and I’ll tell you.

00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:12.460
This man has eloped with the wife of a Brahmin.

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:20.679
He himself is not a Brahmin and this child is from him to her

00:47:20.679 --> 00:47:26.090
and how much he has deceived people everything I know.”

00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:27.090
They were shocked.

00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:28.090
“You know Mother?”

00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:30.430
“Of course.

00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:34.450
I know everything!”

00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:44.760
“Then why do You allow him to come close to You?”

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:48.290
“Do you think he is close to Me?”

00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:53.830
I said, “You are sadly mistaken.

00:47:53.830 --> 00:47:58.310
But it’s nice he’s come to Me

00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:02.970
because he’s been troubling people too much and I’ll correct him.”

00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:07.050
While some people thought he was a great achievement we have got,

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:10.090
and some of them came to tell Me be careful of this man

00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:17.230
without knowing what he was.

00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:22.210
This kind of a divine discretion has to be there.

00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:26.270
If a king does not have that divine discretion

00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:39.170
then he can punish the good and he may help the bad people.

00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:43.240
But this divine discretion disappears when you are self-centred.

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:47.110
That’s the main point, is a complete detachment

00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:50.699
about the power should be there.

00:48:50.699 --> 00:48:52.610
Complete detachment.

00:48:52.610 --> 00:48:55.860
Why should Rajalakshmi care for anything?

00:48:55.860 --> 00:49:01.140
What does She get?

00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:03.070
But now there are some who’ll pamper a person

00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:05.550
this, this and that, and then they feel

00:49:05.550 --> 00:49:11.790
“ah, we’re on top of the world!”

00:49:11.790 --> 00:49:15.610
They just pamper, pamper and pamper

00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:23.060
the ego of a politician and he thinks he is a very big man,

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:31.090
then in the election he doesn’t understand why he’s on the ground.

00:49:31.090 --> 00:49:41.830
So with this self-dignity, self-knowledge, you know what you are.

00:49:41.830 --> 00:49:44.090
Whatever you may tell Me, whatever you may say to Me,

00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:48.040
I’ll listen, “Alright, alright, alright”,

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:54.990
but I don’t accept anything as something great.

00:49:54.990 --> 00:50:01.400
Because if I am that, what is there to be great?

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:07.110
Now supposing this is a lamp here.

00:50:07.110 --> 00:50:09.300
So is it great or not great?

00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:10.410
It is a lamp.

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:23.710
So if I’m Adi Shakti, I’m Adi Shakti, So what?

00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:28.120
If you are a king you are a king so what?

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:32.860
I mean if you are an impostor then you might feel your ego.

00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:39.320
But if you are really the king then you won’t feel.

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:46.240
If you are under the influence of the Goddess

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:51.550
then that is the only thing you enjoy.

00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:56.460
The rest of it is nothing.

00:50:56.460 --> 00:51:01.240
Whether you have diamonds or you have silver

00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:12.830
or you have anything makes no difference at all.

00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:18.540
Now how people misuse the scriptures also one should see.

00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:23.970
That, Rajalakshmi is sitting on the elephant alright,

00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:29.090
so they should have all very big cars, you see.

00:51:29.090 --> 00:51:34.990
She’s sitting on the elephant because elephant is the highest animal!

00:51:34.990 --> 00:51:42.410
Is very kind, very forgiving and has such a tremendous memory.

00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:49.480
That’s why She’s sitting on an elephant.

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:56.390
She’s not sitting there to show off.

00:51:56.390 --> 00:52:02.870
But She’s sitting there to see around, what is happening

00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:11.520
avalokan, She can see around what is happening, to be at a higher place.

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:21.189
That’s why a king is made to sit on a higher pedestal.

00:52:21.189 --> 00:52:25.130
But the purpose is not to show off.

00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:28.189
But the purpose is

00:52:28.189 --> 00:52:34.669
that from that state he can see others better,

00:52:34.669 --> 00:52:44.689
he can be watchful of others.

00:52:44.689 --> 00:52:47.000
If somebody gets a high position

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:57.330
then they think they are the owners of that position.

00:52:57.330 --> 00:53:08.550
This has all come because the brain has gone upside down I think.

00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:12.660
How can it be?

00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:14.580
Logically?

00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:22.449
Now if you are this throne is given, alright, so with the throne

00:53:22.449 --> 00:53:30.800
I sit on this, but this throne cannot give Me anything,

00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:36.630
I can give something to this throne.

00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:40.910
The king has to think he is obliging all these things th

00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:45.630
at he is sitting on them because he is a king.

00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:50.570
On the contrary he thinks all these things are important because something is lacking

00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:54.900
in him or what?

00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:58.870
And that’s why when they come to do Raj

00:53:58.870 --> 00:54:03.970
they start gathering things which are useless absolutely,

00:54:03.970 --> 00:54:11.460
clutter up their houses, homes, everything with something that is useless.

00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:19.710
All their dignity, everything, is itself a decoration on them

00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:21.689
and to show that they are kings.

00:54:21.689 --> 00:54:24.020
Of course they are given a crown,

00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:30.360
they are given a big necklace, they are to wear something here

00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:31.360
because they are kings.

00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:41.110
But these are not actually his decorations

00:54:41.110 --> 00:54:47.770
but these things get decorated by a king.

00:54:47.770 --> 00:54:53.490
For example, you get some lanky panky fellow from the street,

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:59.840
half starved, who is a beggar, say, for example,

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:07.400
and put those ornaments on him and all the dresses of a king.

00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:13.040
Put him on the stage, everybody may start laughing.

00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:19.350
Nobody will think that he is a king by any chance,

00:55:19.350 --> 00:55:22.550
because he doesn’t have that dignity, doesn’t have that face,

00:55:22.550 --> 00:55:24.970
he doesn’t have that body, he doesn’t have that mind,

00:55:24.970 --> 00:55:27.960
he doesn’t have that wisdom.

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:31.850
So how is he a king?

00:55:31.850 --> 00:55:39.199
Like, there was one king who tried to make his shoes of pearls.

00:55:39.199 --> 00:55:41.770
But he’s so stupid looking, you know,

00:55:41.770 --> 00:55:45.810
that when I saw the pearls I said,

00:55:45.810 --> 00:55:51.090
“This is the man only who can think like this!”

00:55:51.090 --> 00:55:54.210
So stupid he was to look at.

00:55:54.210 --> 00:56:01.720
And was sure of these pearls being put on his shoes.

00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:07.890
So there are many such things these days all of these stupid people are doing.

00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:11.480
There are big, big cartoons coming out

00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:17.460
and you can see for yourself how stupidly they live.

00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:23.720
To Me it’s such a difference I tell you.

00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:24.850
Such a difference.

00:56:24.850 --> 00:56:28.680
To them all these things are so important,

00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:36.060
which if they don’t have they’ll buy and put it.

00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:45.270
I know of a gentleman who came with a garland to our program,

00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:53.750
I mean to our dinner, I asked him, “Why are you carrying the garland?”

00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:59.100
“See after all you see I was garlanded so I’m keeping the garland.”

00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:03.180
We didn’t know what to do!

00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:04.800
We Indians will never take a garland,

00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:08.740
first of all, anybody gives you they’ll put it, except for the Gods.

00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:12.320
They will take it out immediately.

00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:14.930
Another lady who came to see Me and she said,

00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:16.730
“I don’t understand these Indians,

00:57:16.730 --> 00:57:19.570
I bought a garland, I put it in my neck

00:57:19.570 --> 00:57:24.920
so they were all laughing on the street at me.”

00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:31.650
Now you Indians understand this, how subtle it is, just see,

00:57:31.650 --> 00:57:35.200
that you can’t put garland, you are not God.

00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:39.980
You cannot buy a garland (laughing) and put it in your neck and walk out.

00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:46.310
Innately you have to be that.

00:57:46.310 --> 00:57:56.919
So the person who is innately a king has the blessings of the Rajalakshmi.

00:57:56.919 --> 00:57:59.820
Then what does She do?

00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:02.760
What does She do to such a man?

00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:07.360
What She does is first

00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:15.210
his name is written on the hearts of the people whom he rules.

00:58:15.210 --> 00:58:23.730
She writes it with her own hand.

00:58:23.730 --> 00:58:26.310
They adore him,

00:58:26.310 --> 00:58:37.680
they admire him and they try to imbibe his qualities within himself.

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:45.050
Another blessing of Rajalakshmi is

00:58:45.050 --> 00:58:54.980
that She grants a particular type of a body,

00:58:54.980 --> 00:59:03.169
which has a coefficience, which gives vibrations.

00:59:03.169 --> 00:59:11.160
They may not be very selfish people

00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:14.740
to make a big advertisement about themselves,

00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:18.010
talking about themselves, this that.

00:59:18.010 --> 00:59:26.740
But the way they are wherever they are, they show.

00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:34.949
We had many like these in our times also.

00:59:34.949 --> 00:59:40.429
Maybe that people didn’t accept them, maybe they are nowhere now,

00:59:40.429 --> 00:59:46.040
some new johnnies are looking to be more jumping.

00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:51.310
But whatever name is written in the heart of the people,

00:59:51.310 --> 00:59:56.419
are the people who are blessed by this Rajalakshmi.

00:59:56.419 --> 00:59:59.810
So what a politician has to understand [is]

00:59:59.810 --> 01:00:05.400
that he has not to make money,

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:14.990
he does not have to have a big show about himself.

01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:21.760
He does not have to do anything that is like

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:26.090
laundering the money from the country.

01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:29.121
He does not have to kill others who oppose him,

01:00:29.121 --> 01:00:33.340
he doesn’t have to shout at those who trouble them.

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:35.270
But what has he to do?

01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:37.690
He has to remember that.

01:00:37.690 --> 01:00:46.330
“I am here for the fame of a good man.”

01:00:46.330 --> 01:00:53.880
He should worry about the fame he will be leaving after his death.

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:57.760
He should see to it that his fame is safe.

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:10.189
For example, see Shri Rama who was a king of benevolence, no doubt about it.

01:01:10.189 --> 01:01:16.300
But His own wife when somebody challenged that

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:21.040
– “She has lived with Ravana and how can She be pure?”

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:27.250
He knew that She was pure, still He decided that He will ask Her to go

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:37.260
because to keep the show, to keep the whole image of a king

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:42.650
and He sent Her away.

01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:48.590
But nowadays you find somebody’s brother employed in America,

01:01:48.590 --> 01:01:54.470
sister employed there and he has made, his uncle has made a big house

01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:57.320
and his wife has accumulated so much money.

01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:03.320
It is all going on.

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:06.390
Everybody will talk like that about that person,

01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:08.990
that he’s just money oriented,

01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:14.020
he just spends money on nonsensical things and he is just exploiting us.

01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:21.440
Everybody will talk but nobody will tell him on the face.

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:26.669
So what you have to worry is about absolute correct character.

01:02:26.669 --> 01:02:32.640
These days this is another point.

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:33.640
Every politician

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:35.431
must have three, four keeps otherwise he is not a politician.

01:02:35.431 --> 01:02:40.890
Like we had Nawabs, we had one Nawab in Lucknow

01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:42.120
who had hundred and sixty five wives.

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:46.740
He thought if he doesn’t have hundred and sixty five,

01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:52.400
people won’t accept him as a Nawab.

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:56.470
So this is another inferiority complex

01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:59.360
that you should have some women around you

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:07.990
so that people will say what a powerful man he is.

01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:16.360
Now those days are gone now, now Satya Yuga has started.

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:25.640
In Satya Yuga I assure you anybody who is not blessed by Rajalakshmi

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:35.110
will have to go to jail or will have to leave the seat,

01:03:35.110 --> 01:03:40.550
will be thrown away or will be as they say,

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:43.090
“Doubly dying go to the waste, dust”.

01:03:43.090 --> 01:03:46.080
It has to be.

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:52.840
They’ll be all exposed, whatever tricks they may try.

01:03:52.840 --> 01:04:05.630
And they will have the consequence of being artificially the rulers.

01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:18.000
But a genuineness is the sign that the queen of blessings,

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:26.330
the goddess of Rajalakshmi, is residing in that person.

01:04:26.330 --> 01:04:36.400
In Satya Yuga it will happen I’m sure.

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:40.930
But even in Sahaja Yoga I find people doing politics sometimes,

01:04:40.930 --> 01:04:43.830
I was amazed!

01:04:43.830 --> 01:04:49.360
People think politics means keeping groups,

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:55.260
making groups, telling things from here to there, there to there.

01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:57.790
That shows you lack collectivity.

01:04:57.790 --> 01:05:08.790
A person who is a Sahaja Yogi will try to cement everyone together

01:05:08.790 --> 01:05:15.360
because the power lies in collectivity.

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:20.649
To break the collectivity for anything

01:05:20.649 --> 01:05:29.620
is very dangerous for that person as well as for others.

01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:35.030
So now you have entered into the kingdom of God,

01:05:35.030 --> 01:05:41.220
you are now sitting in the court of God Almighty.

01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:49.179
Here, of course, as courtiers you have to dress up well,

01:05:49.179 --> 01:05:54.250
sit properly, should take up your seats.

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:57.100
You have to be systematic

01:05:57.100 --> 01:06:01.860
and above board because you are Sahaja Yogis.

01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:05.660
You are not ordinary people.

01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:07.680
You are special people.

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:14.540
How many people in this world are going to be Sahaja Yogi?

01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:17.929
You are special people,

01:06:17.929 --> 01:06:28.760
so try to make yourself such beautiful instruments of Rajalakshmi

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:33.630
that people when they will see you they will vote for you

01:06:33.630 --> 01:06:46.870
and tomorrow you will rule the world.

01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:51.990
I do not want you to get out of politics or get in politics

01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:57.850
but you have to first get the blessings of the Rajalakshmi

01:06:57.850 --> 01:07:00.370
and then only you should understand

01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:04.600
what’s wrong with our country, what we have to do,

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:12.080
what is the purpose, why do we want to become politicians,

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:17.780
what we have to do, we have to have plans, what is your project.

01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:23.920
All these things now put your attention from yourself to outside.

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:27.700
Like, that day I received a letter saying,

01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:31.990
“my father is sick and my mother is sick then my son is sick,

01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:34.900
and this and that and that and that.”

01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:40.090
Such people can’t do much.

01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:42.030
When the war of independence started in India

01:07:42.030 --> 01:07:45.179
we gave up our studies, gave up our parents, gave up everything,

01:07:45.179 --> 01:07:48.040
we were very young people.

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:49.190
So now you have to know

01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:55.490
that if you have to really take to politics

01:07:55.490 --> 01:07:57.850
you have to have the blessings of Rajalakshmi

01:07:57.850 --> 01:08:02.320
and for that you have to build up yourself

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:06.720
with that dignity, with that sense.

01:08:09.209 --> 01:08:14.439
I bless you from My heart that in every country such

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:16.940
people will come up.

01:08:17.839 --> 01:08:20.339
May God bless you
