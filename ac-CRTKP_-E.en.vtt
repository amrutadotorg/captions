00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.170
I’m sorry for being late.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:49.000
I did not know that this programme is in a beautiful place like this.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:04.120
And here you see a beautiful painting of Michelangelo

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:16.100
expressing the desire of the Divine, your Father, to save you,

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.150
to help you out, and is working out.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:49.130
In Germany we have had very great aggressive happenings

00:01:51.070 --> 00:02:06.180
and that brought forth a devastating effect on the Western life, all over.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.000
The value systems were broken,

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.000
the idea of dharma was disturbed,

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.100
women started bahaving like men

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and so many people died.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.100
Very young people died, very very young.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.100
All their desires were not fulfilled,

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:52.150
all their life gave them nothing but war.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.170
That was a kind of a heatwave that came,

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.120
destroying all the subtler things.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.130
When the nature gets its respite, or is angry,

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.000
it destroys only gross things

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.200
but when human beings start destroying

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.070
they destroy even the subtler things like their value system,

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:41.220
your character, your chastity, your innocence, your forbearance.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.200
So now the war is on on the subtler level.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.090
We have to now understand

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:02.150
that all these things have brought such a shattering effect in the West,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.180
on the Western personality.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:18.180
So the first effort one has to do is to repair it,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.110
to put it straight, make it stand on its own legs.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:37.030
Because people lost their personality, their tradition,

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.130
they had no moorings, no roots

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.100
and they started moving towards anything

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:58.240
that was brought in as some sort of a intellectual experience.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.120
The women became very independent

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.220
and they thought they can work out their own problems.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.170
That they thought they can become like men.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Here the problem started even in a worse way.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.050
Because woman is a woman

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.020
and a very little thing which is, call it, a man in her

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.100
and when she tries to avoid what she has

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.000
and develop something that she has very little

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.120
then she becomes funny.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.000
But she may be possessed by so many men who are dead,

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:10.030
her desire to become manly can attract so many bhoots

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.000
who want to enter into a woman’s mind.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:22.150
And when they enter they have the garb of a woman

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.030
and mind of a devil.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.240
And the women can not see it

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.170
because maybe with those devilish things

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.020
in the wordly way they might be successful.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.120
They might be better off. Maybe they can dominate everyone,

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:53.220
they might become meticulous like men, absolutely matter of fact,

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:04.120
very neat, tidy, clean, devoid of all beauty and sweetness.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:20.170
Then these women ultimately become like vampires

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.080
so though the war is over

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:30.100
it is working through the women of Germany, I think.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.170
I’d heard this attack had come before also

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.240
and there were women called as Amazonic.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:52.050
Now that history is repeating itself again.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.080
The other day I had an interview with a German lady

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:02.100
and I was amazed at her attitude

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:08.000
because I felt she’s still a Nazi in her, some Nazi bhoot is sitting in her.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.220
She was a double personality, one way she was talking sweetly,

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:15.000
another way she was a Nazi

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and a fascist.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:29.170
And very cunningly they have got arguments.

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.170
The first thing they can do is to say

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:42.030
that we are siding with downtrodden people, like India.

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:44.230
Indians are Aryans, we are Aryans

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:54.170
and we are people who are sympathising with Aryans.

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:59.100
Indians are spiritual people

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.150
and they feel they are like Indians of all the things, you know, can you believe it?

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:13.100
The quality of life should improve, is the point.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:20.200
The quality of men is different from that of women,

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.020
I have told you many a times.

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:29.170
And if women try to be manly

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.180
then they cannot achieve anything proper.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.000
We have had many like this.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:40.000
You have seen Mao`s wife.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:45.000
You have seen Mrs  Chanka Sheik.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:49.200
Now this new lady Carlos,

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:53.130
Carlos her name is? Marcos, Marcos.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:56.200
So many women like this.

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:02.030
They always make a mess of things when they try to be manly.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.240
In the history we have many women.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:11.150
In India women are very well equipped.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.030
we have had women like Jhansi ki Rani

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:18.070
who fought against the British. She was a widow.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:24.180
She tied her child on her back and fought the British.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.080
They say that her horse jumped from 180ft

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.000
from the turret of a fort

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:40.230
and the Britishers have written down that

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.100
‘Though we have got Jhansi the victory comes to us

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.170
but glory goes to Jhansi ki Rani’.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.180
We have had great women in India.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:52.230
Like Nur Jahan was another great woman,

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.000
we had Chanbebi, Ahalyabai

00:10:56.050 --> 00:11:00.000
but they were all women, they didn’t have ego of men.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:08.200
When it comes to one can work, work in the offices with men

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.180
but they need not become men.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.230
I’ll tell you an example of my own.

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:19.120
I had to build our house in Lucknow.

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:27.100
I did it in real woman style

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.240
and I built a very good house,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.240
better than any man could  build in a very very cheap way.

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:43.000
Like a man would go, first of all he’ll get an architect,

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:46.000
go and measure everything,

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.240
then he’ll try to fit everything into it beforehand.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:55.080
Then he will in his ego go to some expensive place shop

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:59.000
get something expensive, be cheated by that.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:08.050
Then again in his ego he’ll go and get some very expensive labour

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:13.100
and appoint somebody, he’ll be in charge of everything, in charge.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.050
I did it in a very different way.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
I had money, so went and found out

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:30.060
who have the best people, who have the best bricks.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.000
The house was to be built by bricks.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.230
Then what else do you need?

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:41.200
Just like a woman would cook her food, you see.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.200
You need also sand, all right.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:52.230
Then you need cement and you need iron bars, and labour.

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:58.000
So I didn’t go the way men went round.

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:06.240
I found out the man who was selling the best bricks.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:13.130
So he said: “I have no money because I have to put up those  kiln

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.060
and fill them up with the bricks

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.200
and for that you require initial money.

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:25.120
I said: “Alright, I’ll buy one whole kiln from you, whole one.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.020
How much will you take from me?”

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.030
He said: “Five thousand rupees sufficient.”

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.150
But if he said, “If the kiln goes off,

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.080
or there’s something wrong with it, if it misfired,

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.150
then it is your lookout. I said: “Doesn’t matter.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.150
You put one kiln in my name.”

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.240
So I bought a complete kiln from him, complete.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:54.070
kiln is a thing where they put all the bricks, you see,

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:58.070
and then cover it with mud and fire it from down.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.200
Sometimes it could be that the whole thing can go into a waste

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.200
or crumple down

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:08.140
I said: "You do like that. Only 5.000."

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.020
When it is nicely fired and all that

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:17.050
it would cost you nothing short of 50,000 rupees.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.010
Then I went to the river and I said:

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:31.000
“How much for a one part?” – as they call it, a big area of sand.

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:37.130
They said: “At this time, when it is summertime, it is very little,

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.240
but in wintertime it will be quite a lot.”

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:45.220
A man would go, he’d say “Alright, now you need so much, bring it now.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.100
Then you will need more, you bring it now.”

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:52.070
But I didn’t do that, I said “Summertime is a nice thing,

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.150
cheap you are getting, why not buy the whole?”

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:59.240
So I bought the whole part, the whole area of that sand.

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:05.130
All right. Then I went for the ironmongers.

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.170
I said: "Now what about iron?"

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.100
They said: “You have to order

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:15.240
but if you order in bulk then we’ll give you much cheaper.

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:19.020
And cash down you have to pay so much.” I said “Alright.”

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:24.030
I ordered it. So it was all ready, just like we do for cooking,

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:27.000
you get everything ready made, ready there.

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.130
Then what we needed was wood.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.120
So they said “Wood will come from Nepal.”

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:35.120
I said “Alright. What else?”

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.200
They said: “From any other forest it can come.”

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:45.180
So I went to a forest in the centre of India called Jabal

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.200
and there I ordered.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:52.100
The whole wood was cut, newly cut.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:57.070
and in an auction I bought a lot of wood from there.

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:03.000
And I got all that there, plus I got the marble from there.

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:06.120
This marble was never used before, anywhere.

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:12.080
I said: “It’s very simple, I can use this marble for everything.”

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:17.200
So I got marble and wood together from that place.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:24.150
Then the labour. Then I asked my friends

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:30.180
if they knew any good workers who are good at masonary work.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.120
They said: “Yes, this one is good, that one is good”

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:36.150
so I call all of them. I said, “See now you can stay with me in this house

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.000
and I’ll feed you very well and I’ll give you food

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:42.100
and I’ll look after you very well.”

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:46.120
So they all settled down with their family

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
and I used to cook for them.

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:55.230
By cooking I won them over and they would do anything for me.

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:02.100
Absolutely. They’re so kind to me,

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:07.160
they would produce new, new technique that they knew,

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:14.070
they would produce an effect of marble out of the cement.

00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:19.100
All kinds of art that they had they put there.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.110
So such a big house with 20 bedrooms and five drawing rooms dining rooms

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:29.100
was created within one year’s time.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:34.180
Not only that but the price of the house nobody can believe

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:40.190
was one tenth of the one that the architect would have taken.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.120
But it was all written so well, everything done so well

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:48.080
because I didn’t know how to write accounts so what I used to do,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.120
every day I used to say “Alright, today I take out so much money,

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:58.000
then this much was spent. Like that I wrote every day

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.240
and not one single rupee was missing in that.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:07.030
So nobody could prosecute me, no problem

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:10.070
otherwise all the officers who built their houses there

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:12.120
had to go through lots of problems,

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:16.150
their income was taxed, this thing, nothing, nothing happened.

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:21.100
And I got such a huge house made in such a little money

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:23.130
and such a house that people said

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:27.000
that even Taj Mahal may fall down, this will not fall.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.170
As I made a good foundation, everything,

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.210
because I had bricks so cheap.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.040
The whole of that kiln I bought for no price at all

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:40.240
and half of it I sold back because so much remaining.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.050
Then whatever I had bought the sand I brought it,

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:47.240
sold half of it because I didn't need it,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.200
at double the price so I got my sand free.

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:56.060
The wood that I had brought from there

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.030
I got it properly chiseled out

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:01.080
and I had a little tank in which I put it

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:08.150
so the whole thing became absolutely, what you call that, weatherproof.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:14.150
I got it out and half of it I used, half of it only,

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:20.000
for hundred windows and sixty doors and the rest of it I sold.

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:24.200
And even the chips were sold as burning for wood,

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:27.240
you see burning wood, what do you call that?

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.190
So you can imagine something was sold as timber

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.020
and some for the huts,

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.200
but I had to do cooking for them,

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.050
I had to look after their comfort,

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:45.200
I got them nice blankets and nice beds to sleep and this and that

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.240
so they were very happy.

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:52.000
That’s how a woman works out and everybody was amazed.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.230
They could not find any faults with my, accounts,

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.000
they could not find faults with anything

00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:01.230
and I told all my husband’s friends to keep five miles away from me.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.170
Because he was working with the Prime Minister,

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:13.160
people would have said that: “Alright, She’s taking bribes” and things like that.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:17.000
Then there was, another problem was that,

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:21.030
they would have come and told me: “This not good, that not good.”

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:25.240
I kept them out because only they can argue, men can only argue.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.100
Women produce the results.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.060
No conferences, nothing. I said: "Nothing doing",

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.100
"Let me do the job Myself."

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:43.170
Very nicely in the company of all these people I built the house,

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:48.220
a beautiful house which I think they have taken a film,

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:53.050
and you might be able to see the house that I built there.

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:59.140
So when the woman, who is a Sahaja yogini

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:02.140
must develop her special qualities

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.220
because she is very intuitive, woman is very intuitive.

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:09.070
She always reaches the right conclusion in no time.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:14.080
If she’s a woman – but if she’s half-man and a little of a woman

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:17.240
then I don’t know what sort of a thing she is.

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.230
So a woman should try to be a woman, she’s so powerful,

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.170
she’s powerful like this Mother Earth who can bear every sort of thing

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:33.020
and she can give the best that is with her.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Extremely sacrificing, extremely giving, forbearing, loving, forgiving.

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:49.000
When men develop the women’s quality then they become saints.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.230
But not the woman’s quality that they run after women.

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.170
This kind of a nonsense is not there.

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:03.130
They have to be viras, they have to be chivalrous people,

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:07.000
They have to be brave

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:14.240
but with that they have to develop compassion, forgiveness.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.220
But I think it is the other way round in Germany very much,

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.120
and I find around also among Western Sahaja Yogis

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:27.200
this is a very common affair going on.

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:31.080
Women develop horrible egos.

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:38.030
In India women work. Everything they do.

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:44.050
We have had great orators since long time, well known.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:50.220
But they don’t have ego. My mother was Honours,

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.100
in those days when there were only two or three women

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.100
who had done such a degree,

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:58.240
but I never saw her with any ego in her.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.170
My own daughters, one of them has done architecture,

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:09.030
and also interior decoration, she she’s not now working

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:11.030
because her husband is working all right,

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:13.220
but she makes houses for others, she draws for others,

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:19.170
she helps others freely. And she has such friends.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:24.000
So what is the achievement of a woman?

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:28.060
She has more people around her.

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.000
Human power.

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:37.070
She has more human beings around her.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.050
And what is the capacity of men?

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.230
They have all the bills of the house to be paid,

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:49.100
they have to pay for the insurance, the repairs of the car.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:53.100
Let them do the dirty jobs.

00:23:56.070 --> 00:24:00.030
Women receive all the love letters, from the children,

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:02.130
from the husband, from everyone.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.120
They are loved. They are cared for.

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:11.120
Now because they have become manly

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:14.020
they don’t have all these advantages.

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:18.180
Like formerly if you are going in a bus they would give a seat to a lady.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.070
Now nobody does that.

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:25.090
Once a lady was travelling, old lady

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.000
and there was one young fellow sitting there.

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:30.100
I said: “Why don’t you allow her to sit down?”

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:31.100
He said: “Why should I?

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.220
She’s also wearing a pant, I’m also wearing a pant.”

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:37.070
She was...this old lady was wearing trousers,

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:40.200
so he said: “Why should I give her seat, she’s wearing a trouser,

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.200
I’m wearing a trouser, what’s the difference?”

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:50.000
So all that is our advantage and privilege

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:53.150
we are losing by becoming men.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.000
And what do we gain?

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:04.200
Actually, on the contrary, I think in modern days

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:08.170
women are much more slaves of men than they were before.

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:14.000
They get very upset. Say there’s a Sahaja Yogini.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.210
Now she’s caught up very badly and she has certain problems.

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:21.000
First thing she’ll think about

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.080
“Oh God, now my husband will leave me,

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:27.050
he’ll take away my children, where will I do?”

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:29.020
She’ll never think of Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:33.180
But I met one extraordinary woman, I must say she was a real woman.

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:37.180
She said: “Mother, because I’m schizophrenic

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:42.020
I want to get out of Sahaja Yoga. I’ll divorce my husband,

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.020
I don’t want to see my children,

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:47.020
Sahaja Yoga is much more important than me,

00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:51.210
than my husband and my children."

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.140
"There's a woman", I said.

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:55.220
She said: “I am schizophrenic from childhood.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.170
I’ve discovered it now and it comes back on me”.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.030
But mostly women are worried about themselves.

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:03.050
“Oh God, I’ll have to leave my husband,”

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.180
means what they were doing was to sponge on the husband.

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:11.180
“I’ll have to leave my children.”

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:16.240
But what about leaving Sahaja Yoga?

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:20.100
If you think Sahaja Yoga is the most important

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:22.220
you’ll can get rid of your schizophrenia also.

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:26.050
Why should God help you? We are just thinking like ordinary women,

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:28.150
about yourself, only worried about yourself.

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:34.000
Not worried about Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:41.070
Same with some men, but men are not so much frightened

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:45.180
because they think they can stand on their legs.

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:49.000
And women should also know now they are Sahaja Yoginis

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:52.000
that they are Sahaja Yoginis and Mother is going to look after them.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.120
But if you are worried about yourself only, your husband,

00:26:55.140 --> 00:27:01.080
my house, my children, then you are a gone case,

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:04.100
you are no more a woman now. It’s not the sign of a good woman.

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:10.080
A woman is that who loves all the children.

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:16.220
Her loving capacity’s great, but if she becomes miserly,

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.150
if she becomes small-minded, then she’s not a woman.

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:24.100
I told you about my grand-daughters,

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:27.050
I asked them: “What do you want to be?” They’re very small.

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:33.240
So they said: “We want to be a nurse or an air hostess.”

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:37.020
So I said: “Why? What is so great about these jobs?”

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:41.200
They said: “Grandmother in these two jobs only you can feed people.”

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:47.020
There’s no other job in which you can really feed other.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:53.000
The joy of feeding others is greater than writing files in the office.

00:27:55.150 --> 00:28:00.050
Absolutely I tell you. It’s a horrid job to write files in the office, see.

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:07.170
It’s better to do some nice cooking,

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:13.000
thinking so many are going to eat and enjoy it,

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:16.100
than to do this dirty job.

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:20.220
But women have lost their heads, they are not level-headed now.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:23.240
Become stupid.

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:30.070
Now in Germany you have to be very careful.

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.000
In Austria you have to be very careful.

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:35.030
Austrian women are great but I would say German women

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:37.050
that you don’t try to become men.

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:42.050
First of all the best way to stop it is not to talk too much.

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:49.180
If you start talking like men then all the bhoots will enter into you

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.120
and start talking like men only.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:55.070
And then you will see how the men are controlled –

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:59.170
we Indian women know how to control our men much better than you do.

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:06.180
Why we don’t have divorces? Why we don’t have problems?

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.180
We quarrel all right, doesn’t matter,

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:11.070
but our men don’t run after another women.

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:17.230
We don’t dress up s.., I mean, so much, we don’t go to hairdressers,

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.070
we don’t have these beauty aids, all that.

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.220
So develop your self-respect.

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:30.070
You are the Shakti. You are the power.

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:35.200
If you make your men cabbages what sort of children you’ll have?

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:40.080
Cabbages only. Respect them.

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:43.220
Make them men, enjoy their manliness.

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:49.000
Then they’ll never give you up.

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:52.150
There’s no competition between the two.

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:57.180
I find the main problem today in Gemany is

00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.170
that the women have lost their senses.

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:04.220
This is I feel absolutely about German women.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:13.150
Take to music, take to art. So much scope is there.

00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:19.120
Today, who is remembered? See in here, who is remembered?

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:24.020
A musician, Mozart. Everyone remembers Mozart,

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:28.100
even on a chocolate you’ll find a Mozart there.

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:33.220
I don’t know poor thing did he ever eat any chocolates or not.

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:43.000
Or they will remember, see here, they have Michelangelo

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:48.130
or they’ll have Leonardo da Vinci, or they’ll have somebody like that.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
Nobody remembers who was the officer at that time,

00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:59.070
running with the file, up and down.

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:10.220
So women have something that they can be of eternal value,

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:12.170
that they should develop.

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:16.120
The greatest thing is that woman can love, and love and love.

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.180
But when she becomes selfish and self-centred,

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:23.020
starts worrying about herself there’s no beauty in her love.

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:28.000
Today I took it up specially this thing

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:31.000
because today you are worshipping me as Kartiyeka.

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:37.000
Kartikeya was the son of Parvati Umar.

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:50.120
Who was just a mother of these two children, Ganesha and Kartikeya.

00:31:53.150 --> 00:32:04.080
And one day the parents Shankara and Parvati both of them said:

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:13.170
“Out of you two, the one who goes round the Mother Earth first time

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.240
will get a special prize.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:27.050
So Kartikeya was the manly power,absolutely, and he said:

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:32.130
"Alright, I’ll start on his own conveyance”  which was a peacock.

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:36.030
And Ganesha said to himself:

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:38.170
“Now look at me, I’m a little boy,

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:44.170
I am not like him and my conveyance is a little mouse.

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:48.220
How will I manage?” But then he thought:

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:54.100
'My Mother is higher than the whole universe.'

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:57.130
'What is this Mother Earth?’

00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:02.070
So this Kartykeya was out, going round the Mother Earth.

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:06.080
Shri Ganesha went round his Mother three times.

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:10.100
And he got the prize!

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:16.050
Because of that motherly qualities for Him She’s the highest,

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:19.030
even higher than Sadashiva.

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:24.240
But surprisingly that is what Sadashiva likes.

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:28.200
That you respect your mother. The motherhood in you.

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:31.240
The womanhood in you.

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:39.100
‘Where the women are respectable and respected

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.170
there the Gods reside.’

00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:44.100
Women are very important.

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:46.190
Of course I must blame the Western men also.

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:49.000
the way they have ill-treated their women,

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:53.020
have kept out of religion,, have always put them down,

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.000
I mean, India we had Muslims doing that

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:58.200
but they are even very sophisticated aggressors

00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:02.150
and they did it very badly and they kept all of them down.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.240
But doesn’t matter.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:13.000
Still, forgive them and try to be women.

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:20.200
Very powerful. The powers of a woman are that of love,

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:27.150
which are the powers of God. And that is to be used

00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:31.200
than to use other argumentative intellectualism, all nonsense.

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:34.150
Don’t waste your energy with that.

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:38.150
I would like, specially the Sahaja Yoginis of Germany,

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:43.000
to become more and more ladylike.

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:48.070
It doesn’t mean good cooking only but in the attitude towards life.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000
To think in a wider way

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:58.080
that the whole Sahaja Yoga depends on our love capacity.

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:02.030
We have to be extremely loving, extremely kind,

00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:05.160
looking after Sahaja Yogis,

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.100
giving them all the joy that is possible.

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:17.240
Otherwise in this country they can become like vampires.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.070
So be very careful and for men also I would say

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:26.240
if there are women of that kind you must respect,

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:32.000
you must give them all their privileges, look after them.

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:35.200
They look after children but give them all the assistance,

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:39.030
all the money that is needed by them.

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:43.200
Do not ask for accounts and things, let them manage it.

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:47.120
At the most you’ll become bankrupt, as it is you are.

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:56.020
But first see what is their attitude towards Sahaja Yoga is.

00:35:56.030 --> 00:36:01.030
I’ve seen in the families where the women are in charge of the purse

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:04.050
always we get much more money for Sahaja Yoga work

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:08.000
than from the houses where the men are in control.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.130
It’s very surprising. When men are in control

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:15.050
they have to think of their car,

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:18.220
they have to think of many big things,

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:23.020
but when women are in control they know how to save money,

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.120
as I have shown you how I have saved money.

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:28.180
Men can never save. They can never save money.

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:32.130
Only the women can save but if they have a larger interest

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:36.200
otherwise if they are self indulgent they’ll finish off all the money

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:40.020
by going into the shop to buy a shirt for a man

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:44.050
they’ll buy all saris for themselves. They can do like that.

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:48.130
But if they have wider interests, if they have greater interest,

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:53.050
they can use money so cleverly

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:57.200
that they’ll have always money to spend for others. What do I do?

00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:00.070
What has, whatever my husband gives me to run the house –

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:03.170
it’s quite a lot I should say – but I stinge on things,

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:08.080
I go to the main markets, get things from there,

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:11.170
try to save money on that, save here, save on my clothes.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:18.050
I, first time I have given my sweaters for dry cleaning in a good shop.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.200
That’s how a woman saves and then she spends for the general good.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000
Because that is her real satisfaction.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.230
If we develop that kind of a balanced view about our married life,

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.200
about our social life we’ll be ideal people in this world.

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:41.230
About school also, I have said it, very clearly.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.030
Now if you want to hear about it

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:46.240
I would request – have you got that pamphlet with you?

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:49.200
Wanted to read it.

00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:03.220
Uh? No you don’t have. That’s just like men.

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:10.180
They themselves said they would like to read it here you see.

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:23.030
If you ask men to do the cooking everything will be missing. So,

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:28.180
Shri Mataji, may I most respectfully ask you,

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:32.220
is there any advantage at all in being a man?

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:49.070
Without the man woman cannot express herself.

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:53.150
She cannot express, because she is the potential.

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:58.150
He is the kinetic. It’s absolutely relative terminology.

00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:02.200
You cannot, exist without a man, you cannot.

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:06.170
Even if, supposing, if you have all the fragrance in the Mother Earth

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.150
unless and until you have the flowers

00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:11.170
how will you know there is fragrance in Mother Earth?

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:17.070
Men are most important otherwise what will they do?

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:20.080
All their energy will be all rotten.

00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:29.120
So if women are the Mother Earth you are the flowers.

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:39.170
Advantage what? You are the people who, ...everybody sees you.

00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:49.180
Running around like Kartikeya.

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:59.020
What can we do? You are like that.

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:05.150
You cannot sit at home. You cannot even in the train,

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:09.130
if you are going, you’ll find as soon as the train will stop

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:12.240
all the men will get out of the train. They can’t sit there.

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:22.170
Like, I told my husband:

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:25.200
“What is this all the time you are running out of the house?

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.100
Why can't you sit in the house for some time? You must sit.

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:33.070
So he said: "No, in our side if any man, sits in the house

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.200
he’s called as gharkombda",

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:37.180
means 'who is all the time in the house', you see.

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.080
And I said: “What do they call to man

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:41.030
who always runs away from the house gharbhagna

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:43.220
Means 'the run, runner away, who runs away'.

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:45.170
There should be something in between.

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.200
But that’s manly, it’s all right.

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:50.230
But we can, with Sahaja Yoga, what we can do

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:54.200
is to form a little balance between both the things.

00:40:57.170 --> 00:41:00.220
That is what Sahaja Yoga is, that it gives a balance.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.130
Then you start be…enjoying each other’s company so much

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:08.000
that even in the house you enjoy, outside also enjoy.

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:12.070
So you can be together in the house, also outside.

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:18.050
The interests are the same because the interest becomes the same.

00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:23.230
Like the flowers who fall on the Mother Earth

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:27.000
make the Mother Earth fragrant

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:29.220
and then we can say that Mother Earth is fragrant.

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:37.000
As beautiful as that. Alright.

00:41:38.050 --> 00:41:41.020
So for education I’ve already given instructions

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:43.200
and I’ve already talked about it

00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:47.130
that we are not to make a big ado out of this Maria Montessori

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:52.200
and this and that. We are going to have Sahaja Yoga schools.

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:55.080
All nonsense, because I have seen

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:57.000
those who are teaching in Maria Montessori style,

00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:59.200
the women have become horrible.

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:06.020
Was amazed the amount of ego they have developed in themselves.

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:10.150
So you become Sahaja Yoga teachers

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.030
and it’s going to be a Sahaja Yoga school.

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:21.030
In, Sydney or in Melbourne,

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:24.180
we started the school in Melbourne very nicely

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.050
and now they are going to have it in Sydney the same way.

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:31.230
And openly it is a Sahaja Yoga school, there’s no fear about it.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.150
Openly it’s a Sahaja Yoga school,

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:38.080
and then people have achieved so much out of it.

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:41.180
We, why should we take any garb like that?

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:44.200
We should go all out to say its a Sahaja Yoga school.

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:48.000
So you, the teachers, also become experts in Sahaja Yoga,

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:53.080
so they have to be good Sahaja Yogis, Yoginis or Sahaja Yogis.

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:56.230
They should not be egoistical, there should be no ego in them,

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:57.220
they should not be catching,

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.120
anybody who’s catching is not a good teacher for Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:05.070
It’s not like in a Maria Montessori school

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:07.220
that in the night the teacher drinks, smokes

00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:10.120
and morning time she’s a Maria Montessori teacher.

00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:13.070
Here you have to be a Sahaja Yogini first

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:17.020
and then only you can teach in a Sahaja Yoga school.

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:21.100
You have to have that quality, that is very important,

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:25.050
as it is important that we should get students who are Realized Souls

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:27.020
or who can get Realization.

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:35.020
Alright, so today’s puja is specially for Kartikeya.

00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:53.170
Kartikeya represents the great, we can say the captor or leader of all the ganas,

00:43:55.030 --> 00:44:01.000
of all the, like a Commander-in-Chief.

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:07.050
Ganesha is the King but He is the Commander-in-Chief

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:14.150
and because German character is to be in command of everything

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:18.230
we are going to have this puja

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.120
where the men will be in command of their spirits

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.180
and their manly qualities

00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:32.120
and women will be in command of their womanly qualities.

00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:38.230
To be in command is different from to be a master.

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:43.220
Master owns it, a commander does not own it.

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:50.220
He does not own it, that is also lost.

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:54.230
Possession is also lost, we just command it.

00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:59.230
And that is the state we have to come to now,

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:07.100
from Ganesha state to the state of Kartikeya.

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:08.220
The other way round.

00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:11.050
Ganesha is nice, he’s the King,

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:16.240
very nicely sitting down with all the powers, alright?

00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:20.120
Innocence is there,

00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:27.170
but Kartikeya’s the one who commands innocence,

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:32.180
gives you a power of that commandment.

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:38.070
He commands. After the Guru Puja

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:42.150
it's better that we should have the power to command others

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:50.100
and that commanding spirit comes in the men

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:55.240
through their talking, through their dynamism,

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.050
through their personal achievements;

00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:03.120
for the women through their loving power,

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:09.030
through their forbearance, through their gracious behaviour,

00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:13.050
forgiveness, compassion.

00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:18.150
So let us develop that today, that we can command it,

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:21.190
means it’s not that what we have

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:24.100
but in a position we are to command.

00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:28.170
I hope you understand what is Kartikeya.

00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:31.030
May God Bless You.
