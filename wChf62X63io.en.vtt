00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:12.230
I’m spell-bound to see all this beautiful

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:44.670
expression of your love. Such attention
and creativity. I must be the luckiest guru
to get the outside nature reproduced here

00:00:44.670 --> 00:01:15.250
so beautifully. After seeing this, no guru
can escape complete melting of his heart.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:57.469
Actually, My disciples are very clever people.
They can neutralize any guru. So that guru’s

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:07.100
staff which is used for disciplining the disciple
also melts away into a lotus.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:23.370
Every time it’s such a beautiful surprise
to see how Sahaja yogis are getting one with

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:39.459
the Divine. The expression of their joy, the
conception of the Divine you can see very

00:02:39.459 --> 00:03:00.060
clearly. This is how I want you all to sit
in the Kingdom of God as I am sitting today.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:12.599
We have to realize that we are now the part
and parcel of that cosmic consciousness itself

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:38.500
– the Brahma. The One that creates, which
coordinates, which plans into all the details

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:52.219
and the One that loves through its creation,
through its expression is that cosmic consciousness.

00:03:52.219 --> 00:04:13.299
We are not only in it, but we can handle it.
We can regulate it, we can use it, we can

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:28.640
work it out.
This is the state when we are in we are the

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:58.260
guru. Guru means a thing which is higher than
the gravity of the earth, or stronger than

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:14.470
the gravity of the earth. What is the gravity
of the earth? Superficially when we see that

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:27.230
we understand it as a thing that acts on our
body to keep us on the ground. Also there

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:35.970
is a load of a big atmosphere on our head,
of many elephants standing on our head. Plus

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.340
the Mother Earth has the gravity to pull us
towards herself.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:51.800
That’s on the gross level we understand
the gravity and on the gross level also we

00:05:51.800 --> 00:06:04.320
sometimes understand the Guru Principle.
On the gross level we think a good guru is

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:40.740
that person who just attracts you towards
himself –
body attraction, or may be other attractions

00:06:40.740 --> 00:07:00.320
which are gross. And that’s why people always
go to the gurus who are false, who are superficial.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:13.580
But the one who is above the gravity of the
Mother Earth, the gross, the subtle, the subtle,

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:33.800
subtler and the subtlest – beyond all these
attractions – that is the one, is the guru.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:43.910
So in the very gross way we see that normally
people are attracted towards other through

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:55.380
the body element, the gravity acting through
the body.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:11.550
A guru who looks like a cinema actor is very
much appreciated. They cannot see the totality

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:24.300
of beauty, but just one aspect.
The earlier gurus, who came as false gurus

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:37.740
used to paint their faces even, in India.
Or they would go to special decorators, who

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:51.519
would make their hair look like Shankara’s
jatas and eyes were painted with big black

00:08:51.519 --> 00:09:02.720
coal up to this. And the whole body was covered
with a funny type of a powder.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:18.139
Or they would wear a kashaya, a cloth that
was given a color of saffron without using

00:09:18.139 --> 00:09:28.230
the saffron. In two rupees you can get that.
And people would be attracted towards such

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:46.439
a person. They would carry an elephant, to
sit on an elephant, even to add to the propensity

00:09:46.439 --> 00:09:55.860
of the superficial gravity and walk on the
streets. And people would bow to them and

00:09:55.860 --> 00:10:16.769
give them whatever they wanted.
This cannot elevate anyone. Any body attraction

00:10:16.769 --> 00:10:40.189
can enslave you, cannot give you freedom.
It will give you habits for your body enslavements,

00:10:40.189 --> 00:11:05.980
and also it will enslave you to your guru
if he knows how to keep attractive in various

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:22.620
ways.
The whole understanding of the cosmic consciousness

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:36.939
can be put in one little sentence: that it
cannot be attracted by the gravity of any

00:11:36.939 --> 00:11:52.810
stars, earth, moon or sun.
The other attractions one has from the Mother

00:11:52.810 --> 00:12:09.389
Earth are all for food, greed, lust – materialism
at its worst. It comes from matter.

00:12:09.389 --> 00:12:18.999
All that comes from matter, once you start
getting used to it you become a slave and

00:12:18.999 --> 00:12:34.620
not a guru. So the first attempt should be
for anybody: to be a good guru is to get over

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:46.379
material attraction.
In a subtler way we can see it happens like

00:12:46.379 --> 00:12:56.259
this: a lady or a gentleman buys an ashram
in Sahaja Yoga. And a Sahaja yogi start living

00:12:56.259 --> 00:13:11.430
in that ashram. The owner of that house starts
worrying about the house and all material

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:27.379
things in that house rather than the emancipation
of the disciples or the Sahaja yogis who are

00:13:27.379 --> 00:13:32.069
there.
The whole attention is towards the material

00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:48.839
upkeep of the house and not towards the emancipation
of the Sahaja yogis who are supposed to rise

00:13:48.839 --> 00:13:57.730
into the cosmic consciousness.
And such a person, if he starts believing

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:12.740
that he is the guru or in any way even a Sahaja
yogi, he is sadly mistaken.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:26.639
Where is your attention is the point. If you
are the guru, where is your attention? If

00:14:26.639 --> 00:14:39.180
your attention is on the correction and the
nourishment of yourself and of others then

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:53.779
you are first of all the Sahaja yogi. And
once you rise above the gravitational force

00:14:53.779 --> 00:15:07.290
of materialism, then you could be called as
the guru.

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:20.980
Anything that is living has a capacity to
rise against the gravity, up to a point, that

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:31.490
is limited. Like we have seen the trees, they
come out of the Mother Earth and grow upward,

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:39.459
up to a limited space.
Every tree, every type of tree has its own

00:15:39.459 --> 00:15:53.749
limitations. Cedar will be cedar and rose
will be a rose. Is all controlled by the gravitational

00:15:53.749 --> 00:16:13.929
force. But there is one thing which rises
against the gravitational force which has

00:16:13.929 --> 00:16:24.309
no limits, and that is your Kundalini.
It cannot be controlled by the gravitational

00:16:24.309 --> 00:16:42.819
force unless and until you want it to be controlled.
Nothing can control it but you and your Self

00:16:42.819 --> 00:16:56.759
can control it. So, as soon as you become
in charge of your Kundalini, you have crossed

00:16:56.759 --> 00:17:13.930
one step forward that you have overcome the
force that is the gravitational force.

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:22.400
Then the cycle of all the five elements is
bound together. All the five elements have

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:37.780
to go in a cycle in such a way that nothing
is wasted, nothing is spoiled, everything

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:53.000
is organized. But this cycle is broken only
by the awakening of the Kundalini. Because

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:08.950
you enter into the highest of highest, which
is the cosmic consciousness, which you know

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:22.280
how to regulate yourself.
That cosmic consciousness is the Param Tattwa,

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:34.660
is the principle of all the principles, controls
all the principles. So it controls also the

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:47.860
principles of all these five elements. It
controls the Mana Shakti. It controls the

00:18:47.860 --> 00:19:00.000
evolution and gives you the power to evolve
others. So, this great Brahma Shakti is at

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:09.730
your lotus feet.
Perhaps Sahaja yogis do not realize what they

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:28.570
have achieved. The only difference between
a Adi Guru and a guru, Satguru I would say,

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:41.790
is this that the Adi Guru knows that He is
the controlling power. He knows He is with

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:56.810
absolute oneness with the Brahma Tattwa, with
the cosmic. The authority with which He talks,

00:19:56.810 --> 00:20:09.960
the complete confidence with which He says
things. There’s no doubt in His mind. In

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:27.350
anyone of His teachings He’ll say, “I
verily say to you that confidence that I am

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:46.090
with the Brahma Tattwa, that I am the Brahma
and that I am controlling all that Tattwa,”

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:53.230
makes Him a prophet.
Because whatever He says, prophesizes, is

00:20:53.230 --> 00:21:07.160
the truth. Whatever He says about the past
is the truth. And He knows that; He has no

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:18.370
doubts.
The authority with which Moses talked, authority

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:31.300
with which Socrates talked, authority with
which Lao Tse talked – all these great Adi

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:47.290
Gurus, from Adi Nath to Sai Nath, they didn’t
say, “If you do this way will be good, or

00:21:47.290 --> 00:22:01.240
that way would be good.” No, “This is
what it is, you better do it!” This is what

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:12.540
it is.
But in modern times those gurus may not work

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:29.850
out. That’s why a Mother had to come. First
to give you realization.

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:36.790
Because these gurus did not realize another
point: that their disciples not understand

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:46.660
them at all. Whatever they are doing, they
are doing out of awe. But awe doesn’t have

00:22:46.660 --> 00:23:00.400
understanding in it. Or even the earlier ones
may have had, the generation that came afterwards

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:09.470
did not have.
So they turned the gurus into a façade and

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:19.340
the whole building they owned as their own.
Creating all kinds of problems, killing the

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:35.720
universality and the collectivity because
Brahma Tattwa is the power of the collectivity.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:48.940
Is in everything – in the atom, in the molecule,
in the human heart. Everywhere it is reflected,

00:23:48.940 --> 00:24:09.310
depending on the reflector. And it controls.
This understanding they had, but the human

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:15.260
understanding perhaps they did not have. That
if you today tell them something they might

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:20.660
listen to us, but tomorrow they will forget.
So, it was necessary that you all should be

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:27.560
given realization. Otherwise, also without
realization, what’s the use? What’s the

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:39.260
use of talking to people about the colors,
those who don’t have eyes? So realization

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:55.970
has to be given. But it should not be done
with diffidence. When a guru does not feel

00:24:55.970 --> 00:25:07.790
vibrations properly, he become diffident about
giving realization. But even when he feels

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:20.310
it clearly he will not say things with authority.
Authority by any chance does not mean aggressiveness.

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:26.770
Authority is because you have it, that’s
why you express it.

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:36.380
Like this light is now shining on My face.
It is shining; it’s not aggressive. Because

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:42.010
that’s the quality it has got – that it
has to shine, so it is shining.

00:25:42.010 --> 00:26:06.330
In the same way a guru shines before the disciples.
It’s very easy to understand this word shine.

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:16.830
When you have something dirty, it doesn’t
shine. Even the gold which is always shining,

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:26.070
is not tarnishable, if you put it under the
mud it won’t shine. So you have to wash

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:33.660
it, clean it and rub it nicely so that it
shines.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:53.710
But in Guru Tattwa it is from the basics you
have to start. Before the gold came into its

00:26:53.710 --> 00:27:05.910
own state of gold it was mixed with so many
other things. So it had to be heated up, melted

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:15.630
away, sieved out, and so many processes it
had to go through to become gold. So, when

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:33.090
you become Sahaja yogis, you have become gold.
Now, the second job is to keep this gold shining.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:56.460
And third would be to get a part in the crown
of your Mother, so that you can never be tarnished.

00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:09.540
Into these three stages one has to come. First
of all to judge yourself to be a guru you

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:21.900
have to have a gravity of your own, which
is not bound by the gravity of the Mother

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:41.990
Earth. That’s the minimum of minimum.
Which does not mean you wear outside the kashaya,

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:52.340
the dress that suggests that you are a sanyasi.
But from inside you should be a sanyasi. Now

00:28:52.340 --> 00:29:06.600
a sanyasi who is inside a sanyasi will have
a big bank balance, maybe, but will know nothing

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:19.690
about it. Will be very indifferent and any
day willing to part with it.

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:41.650
A sanyasi has to be a person above lust. Should
not know what is a lust is, what is this attraction

00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:59.390
of lust is. That through his Kundalini and
Mooladhara he can achieve it. Because now

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:14.020
you have a capacity to rise above the gravity.
You have got that power now to rise about

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:23.120
this lust business where your attention gets
absolutely ruined.

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:30.500
But in Sahaja Yoga we have everything.
Like on Indian streets you’ll find the most

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:41.130
modern car, a Rolls Royce, Mercedes as well
as you can find a bullock cart and also lots

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:48.040
of cows and buffalos, everything there. In
the same way, I think, in Sahaja Yoga we have

00:30:48.040 --> 00:31:06.230
all kinds.
We have some people who are very great and

00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:20.280
try to achieve a state of untarnishability,
put their attention to it, work it out. But

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:31.520
we also have people who are absolutely useless
things, just hanging onto Sahaja Yoga to use

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:42.640
Sahaja Yoga for their own popularity, maybe,
for their own gains. I don’t know for what.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:57.780
I have seen people who give lectures in the
name of Sahaja Yoga and are badly caught up.

00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:12.200
There is that gravity acting in you, remember
that. The gravity of the Mother Earth. Some

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:23.740
sort of a gravity which should be located.
But some of them are nothing but worms, they

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:37.490
cannot go higher. And the outsiders see those
worms only and try to say that Sahaja Yoga

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:50.030
is no good.
Your Kundalini has the power, it has all the

00:32:50.030 --> 00:33:06.670
powers to make you the highest of highest.
An ordinary grass can become a cedar. There’s

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:23.840
no limits to it. But you must have confidence
in yourself and confidence in Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:34.180
If you don’t have confidence in yourself
or in Sahaja Yoga, nothing can work it out.

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:48.430
But the highest of all is the sincerity which
nobody can instill in you. There are so many

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:58.430
descriptions of a guru, how a Satguru should
be. Not in the West, I didn’t see that,

00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:03.180
because I think they never believed in gurus,
but they have lots of gurus, like Pope is

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:10.149
another horrible, fake guru sitting here.
Then we have another one, Bishop of Canterbury

00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:13.899
sitting there.
All of them are false gurus, know nothing

00:34:13.899 --> 00:34:24.210
about Kundalini, don’t know anything Brahma.
And they just want to denounce Indian ideas

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:31.369
not because they are Indian, but because if
Sahaja Yoga is established they will lose

00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:39.849
all their earnings. From where will they get
their money and their crowns? So they want

00:34:39.849 --> 00:34:47.009
to propound that they are the solution, achieving
nothing, spoiling the name of Christ, saying

00:34:47.009 --> 00:34:56.349
all kinds of things against Him, stupidly,
without knowing the Divine.

00:34:56.349 --> 00:35:04.470
Then we have many in the Islam, horrible people,
just the opposite of Mohammed Sahib, doing

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:12.670
all wrong things in the name of Mohammed Sahib.
It’s something like one can understand that

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:22.279
a thief has to become an imposter to behave
like a king to show that he is not a thief

00:35:22.279 --> 00:35:32.279
and to have his thieving done. This is how
they are, all of them. Right from India we

00:35:32.279 --> 00:35:39.549
have many Brahmins of the same category. This
priesthood has to go. Wherever there is a

00:35:39.549 --> 00:35:52.509
priest, know it’s a mafia. It’s a sophisticated
mafia.

00:35:52.509 --> 00:36:21.569
No Sahaja yogi guru is going to take any money,
nor anybody is going to bow to them. Nor they

00:36:21.569 --> 00:36:42.640
are going to take any kind of special attention.
In the sense in one place we had a ashram

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:54.240
where the guru and the guruvi became very
important, and the guruvi wanted her tea to

00:36:54.240 --> 00:37:03.680
be sent on her bed with a proper table, and
she became a mini-Mataji – or a greater

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:08.749
Mataji, because I don’t demand many things
which she demanded. I never demand anything,

00:37:08.749 --> 00:37:21.089
whatever you do is very great for Me.
And this is how they felt they were great

00:37:21.089 --> 00:37:31.289
gurus by asking for this privilege and that
privilege. Guru has to suffer the most, that’s

00:37:31.289 --> 00:37:41.680
how he can command. He has to be the example
of austerity and of detachment, that’s how

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:50.079
he is going to get respect. In Sahaja Yoga
nobody is going to respect anybody because

00:37:50.079 --> 00:37:58.230
that guru has made so much money out of Sahaja
yogis.

00:37:58.230 --> 00:38:08.190
But the attention on money itself of Sahaja
yogis itself is suggestive that they are not

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:13.900
Sahaja yogis. For example, when you wanted
to collect money – I mean, I never asked

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:19.309
for a house or anything. The idea came from
some Sahaja yogis – there should be a house

00:38:19.309 --> 00:38:28.549
for Me. Who can house Me? Just think of it.
Is it possible? Is it possible to house Me?

00:38:28.549 --> 00:38:39.069
Not possible. So, with the purpose and with
My name, we could have something done in the

00:38:39.069 --> 00:38:49.099
heart of the universe where everybody is sleeping
practically. We had to do something dynamic

00:38:49.099 --> 00:38:59.559
there. And I heard that some stupid people
started arguing on that. That’s again the

00:38:59.559 --> 00:39:11.440
sign of not understanding. If Mother has said,
“Yes,” She would not do it for no reason.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:20.859
So, the power of understanding only come when
we become the power of cosmic consciousness.

00:39:20.859 --> 00:39:26.339
Because cosmic consciousness understands each
and every thing; sitting down here you can

00:39:26.339 --> 00:39:42.930
understand every thing, you don’t have to
go there. Everything. And because your Mother

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:55.680
is a Mahamaya it may not show, but it will
expose one day. So you have to depend on that

00:39:55.680 --> 00:40:03.960
part of Sahaja Yoga, that it is a Mahamaya’s
job. So we should not get disturbed or upset,

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:15.359
it will show.
So, you are doubly blessed. First of all you

00:40:15.359 --> 00:40:25.079
got your realization, which they say is the
hardest of hardest thing to get. You have

00:40:25.079 --> 00:40:37.019
overcome the gravity. And secondly, your Mother
is the Mother of all the Adi Gurus. She’s

00:40:37.019 --> 00:40:44.480
the One who taught all the Adi Gurus. She
created the Adi Gurus and She’ll create

00:40:44.480 --> 00:41:10.690
out of you the Adi Gurus.
But the quality has to be of gold. The guru

00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:23.109
has to himself accept all the challenges,
everything, to go through it. To work it out,

00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:32.749
to cleanse himself, to see for himself how
far he has reached. He has not just to depend

00:41:32.749 --> 00:41:37.619
on some certificates of you people. It’s
not artificiality; it is not falsehood, is

00:41:37.619 --> 00:41:48.230
reality. And when you come to reality you
must know that you have to be satisfied about

00:41:48.230 --> 00:42:00.130
yourself. Then comes the confidence. That’s
how the authority comes in, that you are sure

00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:13.509
of yourself that whatever you are doing is
the reality. Reality and nothing else.

00:42:13.509 --> 00:42:27.529
And this power is within you. The Kundalini
is within you; She is your own Mother. All

00:42:27.529 --> 00:42:34.259
your life you have wasted in doing all kinds
of things. People have gone into lots of penances

00:42:34.259 --> 00:42:42.759
doing anti-culture, great jobs of ruining
themselves and destroying themselves. What

00:42:42.759 --> 00:42:51.210
did they gain? Then they started another sort.
They are busy now with another trip, and they’ll

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:58.190
be busy tomorrow with another trip. Or whatever
they do stupid they do it so seriously.

00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:06.130
That’s the most surprising thing is. And
to all the details, you know? Nothing should

00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:17.759
be missing. The complete stupidity must be
achieved with full sincerity. That surprises

00:43:17.759 --> 00:43:27.809
Me the most. And then – what confidence!
If you ask Me, “Why did you do it?” He

00:43:27.809 --> 00:43:34.660
said, “What’s wrong?” You’re amazed.
There should be a new word rather than bumptiousness

00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:40.999
for this kind of thing.
That you cut your nose and when the doctor

00:43:40.999 --> 00:43:45.140
asks you, “Why did you cut it?” he says,
“What’s wrong? I’ve done it well, better

00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:54.849
than you could do.”
This is how human nature is – that stupid.

00:43:54.849 --> 00:44:13.789
But when it comes to reality, how are you?
Devastatingly we work out our destruction.

00:44:13.789 --> 00:44:25.670
Our construction and our ascent – do we
do it that assiduously, with that caution,

00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:43.839
with that care, with that detailed understanding?
And the best part of it that when you are

00:44:43.839 --> 00:44:55.210
doing it you get joyous – immediately rewarded.
For example, doing all this you must have

00:44:55.210 --> 00:45:08.099
all enjoyed, no doubt. Anything that you do
in the name of God is immediately rewarded,

00:45:08.099 --> 00:45:14.210
the subtlest of subtle in the form of joy.
And grossest of grossest in the form of all

00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:22.920
kinds of things.
So why not do it, something with complete

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:40.180
understanding? Meticulously, carefully. Why
not? With full attention and concentration.

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:46.489
Because the reward is joy.
Ultimately what do we seek is nothing but

00:45:46.489 --> 00:46:03.819
joy. Rationally we understand, but not from
the heart. It doesn’t go in the heart easily.

00:46:03.819 --> 00:46:14.499
Now people are saying, “Mother, open my
heart.” How am I to open it? Just tell Me.

00:46:14.499 --> 00:46:24.789
One has to go for an open heart surgery, I
think, the way things are. To open your heart

00:46:24.789 --> 00:46:35.059
the guru has to be generous. Whatever these
other agurus are doing, just the opposite

00:46:35.059 --> 00:46:44.599
of that. What have you given?
For example, you are having some people with

00:46:44.599 --> 00:47:00.940
you in your house – and you are the guru.
What have you given to them? On material level,

00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:09.430
let us see. Then on physical level, have you
ever massaged their head? I have massaged

00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:20.319
so many people’s head. At least fifty percent
of you had that. What physical comfort you

00:47:20.319 --> 00:47:36.049
have given to that person? If you are the
guru, then what is the emotional confidence

00:47:36.049 --> 00:47:41.720
you have given to that person? If you are
shouting for that person, “Why did you keep

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:51.089
it there? Why didn’t you keep it here?”
Also it is vice-versa among human beings.

00:47:51.089 --> 00:47:59.720
If you try to be nice to somebody that person
becomes ego-oriented. Dangerous stuff, you

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:06.400
know. You are nice to somebody, you are kind
to that person, you give him some money, or

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:10.789
you give him something then they say, “You
go, come and see that person,” I’m surprised

00:48:10.789 --> 00:48:18.200
sometimes, how can it be? But it happens.
I mean, I have been victim of such a nonsense.

00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:22.549
The people had to say, “Mother, You have
spoiled that person.” But I just don’t

00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:34.019
know, how can I spoil?
Why it happens? Because human beings have

00:48:34.019 --> 00:48:40.920
another great quality that they cannot understand
that anybody can care for them, because they

00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:51.299
cannot care for anyone. Anybody cares for
them they become egoistical.

00:48:51.299 --> 00:49:04.619
I’ve known about some Indians who went abroad
and people thought Indians have come as if

00:49:04.619 --> 00:49:15.910
Adi Gurus have come. They can be worse than
you people. And are, no doubt. And then you

00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:23.019
start worshipping them as Indians. And then
you understand that this is just a donkey

00:49:23.019 --> 00:49:31.390
from India you have brought, which is kicking
you all the time.

00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:40.749
The image of that Indian goodness is not there.
Because of this problem the guru finds it

00:49:40.749 --> 00:49:57.089
impossible how to deal with the disciples.
But there is a solution: leave it to your

00:49:57.089 --> 00:50:10.619
Mother and I’ll put them right. All such
problems you can leave it to Me. When people

00:50:10.619 --> 00:50:20.529
try to take advantage of you or take to ego,
tell them, “Now I’m going to leave it

00:50:20.529 --> 00:50:28.549
to Mother, I’m not going to look after you
any more.” That will settle them right.

00:50:28.549 --> 00:50:44.190
They do not know that this cosmic consciousness
is also very mischievous. It has lots of mischiefs

00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:53.829
up its sleeves. And it can work at such mischiefs
that people are amazed and aghast. So, all

00:50:53.829 --> 00:51:01.450
such problems, if you cannot deal you can
leave it to Me. And another one is to their

00:51:01.450 --> 00:51:06.739
Kundalini, to tell them that they are catching
on this or catching on that. It’s your duty

00:51:06.739 --> 00:51:16.979
to tell them that “You’re catching on
your ego. Better be corrected.”

00:51:16.979 --> 00:51:29.999
Now, all of you can become gurus. Every one
of you can become gurus and can develop that

00:51:29.999 --> 00:51:43.039
great capacity to be one with that cosmic
consciousness, completely out of the clutches

00:51:43.039 --> 00:51:55.239
of the gravity of the earth – materialism.
Without achieving that you have no right to

00:51:55.239 --> 00:52:07.269
tell anybody what is to be done.
First it should be your practice and precept

00:52:07.269 --> 00:52:16.710
in your own life, in your own example. And
then your example is sufficient to convince

00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:24.849
others.
Today, through this understanding that you

00:52:24.849 --> 00:52:32.119
have to rise above the gravitational force
of materialism which is today’s religion

00:52:32.119 --> 00:52:41.930
everywhere, whatever they may call it. Whether
it is communism or capitalism or democracy

00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:50.650
or demonocracy. Whether it is Christianity,
Hinduism, Islam or any other nonsense – all

00:52:50.650 --> 00:53:06.579
of that is nothing but materialism in its
all absurd forms. Kundalini is the only thing

00:53:06.579 --> 00:53:20.059
that can take you like the stalk of the lotus
out of this mud of materialism.

00:53:20.059 --> 00:53:32.999
And that is what one has to achieve, specially
in the West. It goes in the subtle and subtler

00:53:32.999 --> 00:53:47.279
and subtlest forms, so be on the lookout,
and ultimately it expresses itself as ego.

00:53:47.279 --> 00:54:04.329
All materialists are egoistical, racist – they
are robbers and plunderers. They go to other

00:54:04.329 --> 00:54:12.829
countries like South Africa and settle down
nicely, robbers and plunderers. And extracting

00:54:12.829 --> 00:54:28.170
the wealth of another.
All this can become very sophisticated and

00:54:28.170 --> 00:54:41.269
beautified – we have to fight that. But
to fight that we have to get out of it completely.

00:54:41.269 --> 00:54:47.359
Otherwise we cannot fight it when we are in
it. So all of us should try to get out of

00:54:47.359 --> 00:54:55.619
it fully. It does not mean that you should
all take out your clothes and say that “We

00:54:55.619 --> 00:55:02.200
have given up everything.” That’s another
style it has started now. It means that you

00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:12.579
respect all that is beautiful, you respect
all that is good, but you are not dominated

00:55:12.579 --> 00:55:19.999
by anything. You are not in the clutches of
anything.

00:55:19.999 --> 00:55:36.279
If I want I can wear a gold chain, otherwise
nothing, doesn’t bother, I don’t care.

00:55:36.279 --> 00:55:42.739
That should be the attitude: if I have, or
if I have to, I will.

00:55:42.739 --> 00:55:50.989
Nothing can dominate Me. Nothing can give
Me status. I stand on My own status and on

00:55:50.989 --> 00:56:11.259
My position and on My authority. Because I’m
that pure consciousness. Nothing can spoil

00:56:11.259 --> 00:56:24.400
Me, nothing can bring Me down, nothing can
bow Me. I cannot make anyone dominated by

00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:35.999
Me either.
This is how we are going to become great gurus.

00:56:35.999 --> 00:56:41.450
Imagine – six hundred and twenty people
are here and one guru is sufficient to change

00:56:41.450 --> 00:57:03.940
the whole world. With six hundred and twenty
gurus, God save the world now.

00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:23.430
There’s a beautiful saying of Adi Shankaracharya,
Tad Nishkala, about Brahma Tattwa. I’m that

00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:33.979
Brahma. On that. If you have? Let Me see.
That’s the best way to understand what you

00:57:33.979 --> 00:57:43.549
are. Just bring it. It’s very famous. Have
you got it?

00:57:43.549 --> 00:57:53.989
Sahaja yogi: Dakshina Murti?
Shri Mataji: No, not that, another one. Just

00:57:53.989 --> 00:59:10.969
bring it. Have you got the book?
This

00:59:10.969 --> 00:59:15.900
is the one. This one is the one. We just read
it in English language.

00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:35.109
When you have got your Nirvana, what happens
to you –
it says that.

00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:45.630
Guido reads:
OM, I’m neither the mind, Intelligence,

00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:58.690
ego nor chitta, Neither the ears nor the tongue,
Nor the senses of smell and sight, Neither

00:59:58.690 --> 01:00:07.660
ether nor air, Nor fire nor water nor earth,
I am eternal bliss and awareness.

01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:16.759
I am Shiva! I am Shiva!
I am neither the prana, Nor the five vital

01:00:16.759 --> 01:00:26.190
breaths, Neither the seven elements of the
body, Nor its five sheaths, Nor hands, nor

01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:36.339
feet, nor tongue, Nor other organs of action.
I am eternal bliss and awareness. I am Shiva!

01:00:36.339 --> 01:00:43.789
I am Shiva!
Neither fear, greed nor delusion, Loathing

01:00:43.789 --> 01:00:54.119
nor liking have I, Nothing of pride or ego,
Of dharma or liberation, Neither desire of

01:00:54.119 --> 01:01:07.339
the mind, Nor object for its desiring. I am
eternal bliss and awareness. I am Shiva! I

01:01:07.339 --> 01:01:13.019
am Shiva!
Nothing of pleasure and pain, Of virtue and

01:01:13.019 --> 01:01:21.529
vice do I know, or mantra, or sacred place,
or Vedas or sacrifice, Neither I am the eater,

01:01:21.529 --> 01:01:33.160
The food nor the act of eating. I am eternal
bliss and awareness. I am Shiva! I am Shiva!

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:43.190
Death or fear, I have none, Nor any distinction
of caste, Neither father nor mother, Nor even

01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:53.559
a birth have I, Neither friend, nor comrade,
Neither disciple, nor guru. I am eternal bliss

01:01:53.559 --> 01:02:02.959
and awareness. I am Shiva! I am Shiva!
I have no form or fancy, The all-pervading

01:02:02.959 --> 01:02:14.930
I am, Everywhere I exist, And yet I am beyond
the senses, Neither salvation I am, Nor anything

01:02:14.930 --> 01:02:17.369
to be known. I am eternal bliss and awareness.
I am Shiva! I am Shiva!

01:02:17.369 --> 01:02:18.859
Shri Mataji: That’s what you are. You are
eternal bliss and awareness. The consciousness,

01:02:18.859 --> 01:02:18.859
the pure consciousness.
I think, this must be – everybody must remember

01:02:20.559 --> 01:02:21.979
you are.
May God bless you!

01:02:21.979 --> 01:02:23.640
Sahaja Yogis sing Satchitananda Rupam Shivoham
Shivoham.

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:26.249
Shri Mataji: Now all the leaders have to come
on the stage today to help with the puja.

01:02:26.249 --> 01:02:26.509
Yesterday I could not take the name of all
the leaders who were very good, who have come

01:02:26.509 --> 01:02:26.759
very recently and are doing great work like,
persons like Xavier I would say, he has been

01:02:26.759 --> 01:02:27.019
appointed only a few months back in Milano
and he is doing such a good work. And there

01:02:27.019 --> 01:02:27.289
are other people, say in Venice. And also
we see that recently some leaders have been

01:02:27.289 --> 01:02:27.319
appointed in Melouse and Montpellier. They
are doing very good work, I get very good

01:02:27.319 --> 01:02:27.359
reports about that place. I’m amazed how
the new centers have coming up so well. Even

01:02:27.359 --> 01:02:27.390
in Australia there are many new centers that
have come up which are doing such good work.

01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:27.420
In England there are so many new centers that
have started and we are doing good work. Some

01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:27.459
of the old people are dropping out, but the
new people are coming up are very good. We

01:02:27.459 --> 01:02:27.489
find it all over, all over this kind of thing
happening now. A new dynamic leadership is

01:02:27.489 --> 01:02:27.519
coming from people and I’m amazed how they
have joined very recently as leaders of smaller

01:02:27.519 --> 01:02:27.559
places and are doing so good in every country.
Even to take all the names may not be possible,

01:02:27.559 --> 01:02:27.609
but I feel that so many of them have been
really doing such a good job that only Divine

01:02:27.609 --> 01:02:28.109
can explain it.
It’s the Divine’s great blessings that

01:02:28.109 --> 01:02:28.569
we have got all the right people. Sahaja Yoga
is definitely progressing. It should not progress

01:02:28.569 --> 01:02:29.619
faster than the Divine wants it to progress,
and so we should accept that speed.

01:02:29.619 --> 01:02:31.739
But still we should try our level best, because
it is our job to try and work out as much

01:02:31.739 --> 01:02:32.839
as possible and as far as we can go.
May God bless you all.

01:02:32.839 --> 01:02:34.099
All those who are working in smaller places
as leaders, for everyone I get report and

01:02:34.099 --> 01:02:35.509
I understand them and I have tremendous feeling
for all of them. But some of the places where

01:02:35.509 --> 01:02:36.690
there are smaller ashrams and things, problems
are cropping up and I’m surprised how still

01:02:36.690 --> 01:02:37.049
these problems are there. So everybody must
try to correct oneself – should become an

01:02:37.049 --> 01:02:37.049
example of compassion, love and understanding.
And I hope I will have no reports at least

01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:38.229
the wives of the leaders. I’ve been speaking
about them all the time. So, the wives have

01:02:38.229 --> 01:02:39.200
a greater responsibility because they are
the source of compassion and not of disciplining.

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:40.079
They are the source of joy and not of controlling.
They are the source of motherliness and not

01:02:40.079 --> 01:02:40.410
guruness. So they have to be very different
personalities. Instead of that they think,

01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:40.819
“We are guru’s wives, so we can do what
we like. We can dominate people, and shout

01:02:40.819 --> 01:02:41.779
at people and can arrange everything ourselves.”
No, they have to be completely on the background.

01:02:41.779 --> 01:02:44.009
And for that I can mention it so many of them
are very good wives, who have shown great,

01:02:44.009 --> 01:02:44.640
great understanding of their role as Sahaja
yoginis.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:45.329
So, I would request you not to become gurus
yourself, but to become guruvis. And guruvis

01:02:45.329 --> 01:02:45.869
are the ones who look after the other side
of the guru which may be neglected because

01:02:45.869 --> 01:02:46.479
of his disciplining nature which he has to
have. And they are the ones who are the cementing

01:02:46.479 --> 01:02:47.059
factor. If the guru is the brick, they are
the cements. But it acts sometimes other way

01:02:47.059 --> 01:02:47.690
round. So, I didn’t say much about them,
but I hope this evening I might say something

01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:47.880
about them.
May God bless you!
