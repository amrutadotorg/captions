Title: Talk on evening before Sahastrara Puja
Location: Thredbo, Australia

01:57.810 --> 02:04.810
Date: 2.5.1987

02:17.560 --> 02:24.560
So very nice to see you all here, all my children.
Your love out beats me. I really find no words

02:39.830 --> 02:46.830
to express my feelings. The way you have taken
to Sahaja Yoga and the way you have established

02:53.750 --> 03:00.750
yourself in Sahaj Yog. I know it is very difficult
to spread Sahaja Yoga. Everywhere it is difficult

03:06.220 --> 03:13.220
because you know these are the times of kaliyuga.
I am not tired of the journey so much as the

03:21.340 --> 03:28.340
fighting the evil forces around us. When I
came to Canberra, I felt the left swadhistana

03:31.819 --> 03:38.819
very strong, so strong that I could not walk
few steps and I asked them what’s the matter?

03:40.519 --> 03:47.519
They told me that TM, there is some Chinmoy
fellow, they are very strong here. Apart from

03:49.430 --> 03:56.430
that there are other spiritualist forces which
they are announcing in the newspapers.

03:56.599 --> 04:03.599
It’s shocking that human beings take to
these horrible things so easily and try to

04:08.870 --> 04:15.870
work it out. When you study the reason why
they take to these horrible things then you

04:19.220 --> 04:26.220
realize one thing that these things promise
quick results. Like supposing somebody’s

04:29.790 --> 04:36.740
son has been lost. So, they will say, “All
right. You come to our group, we’ll find

04:36.740 --> 04:38.710
it out for you.”

04:38.710 --> 04:43.480
Or else, somebody says, “I am under a great
strain.”

04:43.480 --> 04:47.940
“All right. You come to our group, we will
remove your strains.”

04:47.940 --> 04:54.940
It’s very easy to remove the strains by
putting a entity, what we call the bhoots,

04:57.890 --> 05:04.890
into someone so that the bhoot takes over
for the time being. But, here the seeker is

05:05.520 --> 05:12.520
not a deep person. Those who were deep people
came back from all these horrible people.

05:12.890 --> 05:19.890
With the TM, I can tell you, we have been
able to salvage some people, not all of them.

05:22.700 --> 05:29.700
When first it was brought to my notice, I
had a meeting in England and we had from TM

05:32.650 --> 05:39.650
at least hundred people. Out of which we can
say about ten to twelve people we have been

05:40.700 --> 05:47.700
able to salvage. But the growth, spiritual
growth in them was very slow and they were

05:48.660 --> 05:55.660
just frightened of Me. They would not look
at Me. They had awe about Me. Whenever they

05:55.780 --> 06:02.780
saw me they would shake. There is one fellow,
Chinese, who came from TM, and I think Rustom

06:05.680 --> 06:12.680
was there, and he just took My name and he
jumped under a table and landed himself outside

06:15.440 --> 06:22.440
in the lounge and they started looking at
him where has he disappeared. With this Chinese

06:23.510 --> 06:30.510
fellow, we tried with him, but he used to
shake and horrible [UNCLEAR], poor thing.

06:31.200 --> 06:38.200
Then he left Sahaja Yoga in a way and somebody
met him in a restaurant or in a book shop

06:45.250 --> 06:52.250
and somebody met him there, and they asked
him, “How do you feel? How do you feel about

06:53.280 --> 06:57.320
Mother?” He said, “Oh! Ho! Ho! Ho! She
is a tremendous power.”

06:57.320 --> 07:04.320
So, you see, they are so weak, they are so
gone down. It’s very difficult to bring

07:08.810 --> 07:14.890
them to normal conditions. Within two, three
years they become recluses. They are even

07:14.890 --> 07:21.890
afraid of, what you call garlic. If you show
them the garlic they start shaking. If you

07:22.200 --> 07:29.200
show them the lemon they start shaking. They
become recluses. We get few people from there,

07:30.030 --> 07:36.580
TM, but their bhoots are so strong that they
will not stick on to us much. Even they come

07:36.580 --> 07:43.580
down for a short time, again they go back.
So, this is the situation with these TM people.

07:43.990 --> 07:50.990
And with this Chinmoy fellow I had an encounter
in America and there the people they came

07:54.800 --> 08:01.800
and told me that “Why this Chinmoy is here
and why doesn’t your husband tell to Secretary

08:01.870 --> 08:07.050
General about it?” And you know who was
the Secretary General that time, [Wol Dahm?]

08:07.050 --> 08:13.820
and all the rest of it. And they were all
crazy people. How Wol Dahm is now being cheated

08:13.820 --> 08:19.130
by people and now he is not allowed to go
to America and all that. Actually his luck

08:19.130 --> 08:26.130
was not so bad but this bhoots, you see, they
made him so funny that he just could not come

08:26.920 --> 08:33.610
back to his normal self. Now this gentleman
was not so much into this Chinmoy but there

08:33.610 --> 08:39.879
was one south Indian gentleman who was in
the UN and he said that “This Chinmoy is

08:39.879 --> 08:46.879
very good.” This Chinmoy used to play tennis,
used to swim, used to drink, have women, he

08:47.459 --> 08:54.459
was a real yanky and despite that people said,
“Oh! He is great because he knows how to

08:55.939 --> 09:02.939
speak well.” So, all those speech loving
people he got. That’s another style of people

09:05.089 --> 09:11.920
who are not seekers but who just want somebody
to talk, talk, and talk. He could talk on

09:11.920 --> 09:18.920
Gita, he could talk on this, he could talk
on every kind of thing. Now, the big difference

09:19.199 --> 09:26.199
is, in Sahaja Yoga you have to accept Me.
There you don’t have to accept anyone. As

09:29.060 --> 09:35.250
long as you accept Gita, as long as you accept
Bible, as long as you accept something – is

09:35.250 --> 09:42.250
not there, which is dead, which is finished.
So, these people are interested only in your

09:42.769 --> 09:43.560
money.

09:43.560 --> 09:50.560
So, they don’t worry about these old, we
should say, prophets who are dead now or we

09:52.060 --> 09:57.240
can say the incarnations who are dead. They
have nothing to do. Just they describe them,

09:57.240 --> 10:03.829
take the money. That’s they want. They only
want to have money, money, money and money.

10:03.829 --> 10:08.899
They are not interested in your welfare or
anything. They have no idea of Kundalini,

10:08.899 --> 10:13.920
they cannot raise your Kundalini, they cannot
give you realization, they cannot look after

10:13.920 --> 10:18.870
you – nothing of the kind. Only thing what
they want, whatever money you have they should

10:18.870 --> 10:25.870
have it. And the way they do it is a very
camouflage sort of a drama they play, that

10:26.420 --> 10:33.420
they can deliver the goods. What are the goods
they are going to deliver to you? Except Self-Realization.

10:37.439 --> 10:43.490
Even the people who talked of Self-Realization
never gave Self-Realization to anyone. I have

10:43.490 --> 10:50.490
seen this Yogananda’s disciples. The early
ones, they had to cut their tongues because

10:51.639 --> 10:58.639
according to him, in his own kriyayoga, you
had to put back your tongue here for a khechri

11:00.430 --> 11:03.850
and that’s why they had to cut their tongue.
They cannot speak, they cannot do anything.

11:03.850 --> 11:09.790
They are just like dogs, you see, wagging
their tails. Very good people, they are doctors,

11:09.790 --> 11:16.600
architects, very good people. All these things
have happened to all these great seekers,

11:16.600 --> 11:23.600
I should say, but they were stupid to accept
anyone like that. First of all, you must see

11:24.249 --> 11:31.249
what are other, are doing others, say other
disciples are doing. How are they, majority

11:32.350 --> 11:39.069
of them? In Sahaja Yoga also we might get
somebody a very useless person and might get

11:39.069 --> 11:46.069
somebody a very low grade or a very low caliber
personality. We do get on the periphery, we

11:46.949 --> 11:53.279
do get. But they should see other people who
are seriously involved in Sahaja Yoga. How

11:53.279 --> 12:00.050
they are behaving? What is their way of doing
it? And how their life is? What have they

12:00.050 --> 12:05.819
achieved? What powers have they achieved?
And what kind of a life they lead? That is

12:05.819 --> 12:09.689
how you should judge the person to whom they
have to do.

12:09.689 --> 12:15.800
I am sorry that this Canberra is so full of
Left Swadistana and if you allow these things

12:15.800 --> 12:20.529
to continue I don’t know what will happen
to your government. It will all go to dogs

12:20.529 --> 12:27.319
if this stupid thing is allowed to work out
because all those booths will jump on all

12:27.319 --> 12:34.319
these civil servants and serious things can
happen. I am quite surprised how it is allowed

12:34.649 --> 12:41.649
in Australia where is the land of Shri Ganesha.
As it is I am here now, I am sure something

12:43.529 --> 12:50.529
will happen and they will give up that. But
as far as coming to Sahaja Yoga, I would say,

12:51.910 --> 12:57.959
it’s a headache. You better give yourselves
a bandhan before touching them anywhere near

12:57.959 --> 13:02.059
because they will give you lot of trouble.
I have had lots of trouble with them. So much

13:02.059 --> 13:08.649
so, we had to leave one of our ashrams. You
see, we had three persons in that ashram from

13:08.649 --> 13:15.600
TM and they used to scream so much and this
jumping about was so much that the neighbors

13:15.600 --> 13:20.230
told us that, ”You better get out from here”
and because of them we had to get out. All

13:20.230 --> 13:22.759
kinds of funny things they do.

13:22.759 --> 13:28.930
First time I saw these TM people, were in
a hall, and they took the first chairs. First

13:28.930 --> 13:33.910
row they were sitting there. As soon as I
started speaking they all started jumping

13:33.910 --> 13:39.279
like jack in the box. I was wondering, “What‘s
the matter? Is perfectly alright? Who are

13:39.279 --> 13:43.809
these people?” I had never seen such a thing
before. I was quite surprised that who are

13:43.809 --> 13:46.860
these people jumping like this one by one.

13:46.860 --> 13:52.230
Then I asked them, they said, “We do TM
and we are doing siddha course.”

13:52.230 --> 13:58.160
“Siddha course? Stupid people you are, that’s
what you are.” And out of these 6 or 7 people

13:58.160 --> 14:04.689
who were jumping we could save about, I should
say, two or three.

14:04.689 --> 14:09.279
So, those people who have gone to that you
shouldn’t worry so much about them. But,

14:09.279 --> 14:14.059
of course, if it is gone to the government
it is better to beat the government with shoes

14:14.059 --> 14:18.660
and give bandhan to the government so that
they don’t get entangled with it. But is

14:18.660 --> 14:25.660
serious thing and I have to work it out myself
on those lines because I was quite shocked

14:25.879 --> 14:32.879
that in Canberra they have such bad vibrations.
I came to Canberra much before with my husband

14:33.809 --> 14:37.559
and I told him that “The vibrations here
are very, very bad.”

14:37.559 --> 14:40.019
So he said, ”All the capital cities are
like that.”

14:40.019 --> 14:46.569
I said, “But it seems rather funny that
both the centers are catching so badly.”

14:46.569 --> 14:51.619
And I couldn’t walk that time also and today
also the same thing happened to Me.

14:51.619 --> 14:58.619
Now, we have many other people who are seeking
God. They live in the villages. These people

14:59.779 --> 15:05.899
have not gone to the villages because they
wanted only rich people, monied people. So,

15:05.899 --> 15:11.430
there are many people in the villages who
haven’t yet received their Self-Realization

15:11.430 --> 15:16.939
and they can receive their Self-Realization
without any difficulties. You can go there

15:16.939 --> 15:23.939
and talk to them and get them realized because
they are not people for whom these rakshashas

15:26.879 --> 15:33.110
are waiting. We have to give them realization.
Once you give realization to people in the

15:33.110 --> 15:39.329
villages, things will change. The atmosphere
will change and you find lots of people coming

15:39.329 --> 15:44.439
to Sahaja Yoga. So, I would say, I am very
happy that in Sydney itself we have so many

15:44.439 --> 15:50.149
centers and in other cities you have so many
centers. But now we have to reach the villages

15:50.149 --> 15:57.149
and see them. They are innocent, simple people
living in the villages in a very simple manner

15:57.569 --> 16:04.569
and is better to give them proper attention
because they are the ones who will get realization.

16:07.740 --> 16:14.740
Then the children, children should be attended
to. They can be very nicely brought to Sahaj

16:14.779 --> 16:20.769
and because there may be many of them who
are already born realized. So the children

16:20.769 --> 16:25.639
can be brought into Sahaja Yoga but not without
the permission of their parents because the

16:25.639 --> 16:32.639
laws and regulations are such that we may
land up in the prison without asking the permission

16:33.540 --> 16:35.779
of the father or mother. So, one has to be
very careful.

16:35.779 --> 16:42.779
The another are the adolescent boys and girls
who are studying in the colleges and who are

16:44.869 --> 16:51.569
not yet exposed so much to all these bad things.
They might be drug addicts little bit or may

16:51.569 --> 16:58.569
be other addiction they might be having but
they are not yet touched by these horrible

16:59.839 --> 17:06.839
evil forces. So, you can just attend to them.
You can also advertise that you can look after

17:06.839 --> 17:13.839
people who are addicted to all these drugs
and all that. You can relieve them. If you

17:13.860 --> 17:20.430
are allowed to do that you can advertise,
get those people and if you give them realization

17:20.430 --> 17:27.430
they might be able to get over their addiction
completely. There is a doctor, Dr. Wells,

17:28.300 --> 17:32.730
in London who has now become a very big doctor
in charge of a hospital of addiction. So,

17:32.730 --> 17:38.520
I said, “What do you do to them? How do
you manage this addiction business?”

17:38.520 --> 17:44.770
He said, “In their absence I beat them with
shoes, that’s all and they are all getting

17:44.770 --> 17:46.040
rid of their addiction.”

17:46.040 --> 17:52.830
So, you can attend to those boys who are now
grown up boys and are taking to drugs and

17:52.830 --> 17:57.980
things like that. They are seekers. That’s
why they are going to these things. I think

17:57.980 --> 18:03.690
this kind of an attitude if you have that
you are not going to attend to people who

18:03.690 --> 18:10.310
are already with some gurus and with something
and encounter them. But attend to people who

18:10.310 --> 18:17.310
by their innocence have fallen into some problems
or to the innocent people in the villages

18:17.410 --> 18:22.690
or children who are innocent. I am sure you
can prosper faster.

18:22.690 --> 18:29.110
So, Sahaja Yoga is growing very much faster
here and in a way in a city it is growing.

18:29.110 --> 18:35.160
We can grow much faster, I think, the way
there are people, so many people, are in the

18:35.160 --> 18:42.160
villages and in the countryside; in a very
simple way they live. As for Myself, to come

18:44.730 --> 18:51.040
to Australia is such an excitement and such
a joy because last year I could not come and

18:51.040 --> 18:57.550
this year when they said it was a Sahastrar
Puja and had to perform here and be there,

18:57.550 --> 19:04.550
I was very happy. Tomorrow we have to have
that Puja. I was also a person in a way you

19:09.590 --> 19:16.590
can say, a seeker, because I was trying to
find out a method, the way, by which I could

19:17.330 --> 19:23.330
really give en-masse realization. I could
give realization to many people at the same

19:23.330 --> 19:30.330
time and for that I was really working very,
very hard, understanding lots of people, human

19:32.090 --> 19:38.400
beings, and out of them I found bureaucrats
are the worse. As you have lots of bureaucrats

19:38.400 --> 19:44.160
in this Canberra, may be, that they are not
so good because they have to compromise all

19:44.160 --> 19:51.160
the time. They have to say, “Yes sir, yes
sir,” and despite their resistance, despite

19:52.020 --> 19:59.020
their not liking, to say that, they are poor
things, pushed into a job where they have

20:06.150 --> 20:13.150
to work it out because after all job is important.
When all these things become important, the

20:14.680 --> 20:21.560
person’s personality suffers a lot. That’s
what I found that the bureaucrats who are

20:21.560 --> 20:28.130
seeking all the time power, go after the man
who can give them some more power, in the

20:28.130 --> 20:32.760
sense the power not of the divine but over
the people that they can dominate more people

20:32.760 --> 20:39.260
and they can manage more people. And that’s
why these people fall into these groups because

20:39.260 --> 20:45.250
in the beginning they feel relaxed in a way
and they dominate many people as there are

20:45.250 --> 20:51.360
booths sitting with them who give them ideas.
But then they get tired of them and then they

20:51.360 --> 20:58.360
fall sick. So, many people commit suicide
also, suicide. I was told that suicide is

20:59.920 --> 21:06.920
maximum, suicide cases are maximum in Canberra.
The reason is this only that you don’t know

21:07.210 --> 21:13.110
what to do with yourself. You suffer from
some sort of a miserable disease. You don’t

21:13.110 --> 21:20.110
know how to get out of it and then you commit
suicide. So, all these things are connected

21:22.550 --> 21:29.550
with the attack of the evil forces and these
evil forces attack you in a very subtle manner.

21:31.560 --> 21:38.560
So, one should be careful as to mature. One
has to mature in Sahaja Yoga so that nothing

21:39.180 --> 21:46.180
can affect them, nothing can trouble them,
nothing can bother them. One has to mature.

21:46.570 --> 21:51.820
The maturity should be such as like Mine.
If I catch it, I mean, I deliberately catch

21:51.820 --> 21:56.700
it and then I try to solve the problem. But
if you cannot do that then you should not

21:56.700 --> 22:02.590
catch also because you will suffer little
bit by catching them.

22:02.590 --> 22:08.850
Now, for tomorrow’s puja I hope you will
all be ready and you will all enjoy tomorrow’s

22:08.850 --> 22:13.620
puja. Had a very nice puja in Pune which I
had to perform on the thirteenth because it

22:13.620 --> 22:20.620
is the date called Akshaya Thrithya, means
undestructible third day of the moon. That’s

22:22.920 --> 22:28.740
actually nobody knew, but it is the puja of
the Kundalini. That day everybody felt very,

22:28.740 --> 22:35.740
very clear. Very clear. Puja was hardly for
about half an hour, the real puja of the Kundalini.

22:38.920 --> 22:45.700
But everybody felt extremely clear and beautiful.
So, that sort of puja we should do tomorrow

22:45.700 --> 22:52.700
also, if possible, so that we’ll have the
feelings of Sahastrara completely opened out

22:55.810 --> 23:01.750
because even if Sahastrara is opened, the
rest of the chakras, if they are caught up

23:01.750 --> 23:07.450
then you have problems. It’s better to clear
out all the chakras and then the Sahastrara.

23:07.450 --> 23:12.560
So, tomorrow we’ll do the puja in that fashion
and I hope it will work out very well for

23:12.560 --> 23:13.490
all of you.

23:13.490 --> 23:20.490
I hope I have been rather late for all of
you and I am not taking too much of your time

23:24.680 --> 23:31.680
here. Tomorrow I think it should be, you see,
actually you’ll be surprised that this is

23:35.660 --> 23:42.660
the time I opened the Sahastrara in India.
This is exactly the time because just now

23:45.230 --> 23:52.230
is 6.30 there, 6.35 and about 6.30, I opened
Sahastrara. So, you can imagine this is the

23:52.760 --> 23:59.760
time I opened the Sahastrara there and

24:18.120 --> 24:25.120
this is the time we are sitting on

30:15.100 --> 30:22.100
the other side of the world and celebrating
that day, that great day

31:07.210 --> 31:14.210
of Sahastrara being opened out. It’s a very
great day in the history of spirituality,

31:49.990 --> 31:56.990
very great day for the whole world. They will
realize one day what

32:52.700 --> 32:59.700
it was. Such a big time that Sahastrara could

33:32.120 --> 33:39.120
be opened for masses. Not only that but you
are empowered to do that great work.

35:37.730 --> 35:44.730
May God bless you.
