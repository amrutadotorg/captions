00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:28.520
You don't know how your Mother feels

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.920
to see so many people

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.880
who have become really gurus themselves.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.920
They have been seeking the Truth

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:56.000
in a very difficult times.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.240
They have been wanting to know what is the Truth.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.680
And this difficult time, itself, has served

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:15.480
to act upon your minds

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:21.080
that what is happening in this world,

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:28.840
whatever we are seeing around us,

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:36.200
in the whole world also, there is something definitely

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:42.680
very wrong and we have to go beyond.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:53.400
In the seeking, one thing is very important,

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.080
that the person should have

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.720
a great devotion about it.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:13.080
And also untold miseries you have to go through.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:23.440
Seeking is when within yourself also you are struggling

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:30.120
and outside also you find nothing satisfactory.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:38.560
This is how the seeking has a double edge.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:49.080
In that seeking, when you are trying

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:55.280
to get to the Truth, it seems it's a very difficult thing.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:02.640
But you can't help it, because you are not satisfied

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000
with what exists around you.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:17.360
See the world today, it's full of strife.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.440
All kinds of strifes are there.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:26.360
People are fighting for nothing at all - for land;

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.920
killing human beings.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:37.640
Land, can it create human beings?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.960
They are fighting in a very collective manner

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:49.440
thinking they are doing a very great service to humanity.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.720
The thinking today of human beings

00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:00.520
is not at all deep, it is very superficial

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.040
and that's how you find this world full of turmoil;

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:10.360
every day, every minute you can find...

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.520
they are killing so many human beings.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:21.800
This is they are torturing, in a very large scale:

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.480
Formally, of course, the saints were all tortured

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:32.800
- tortured by all kinds of

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:38.840
different stupid ideas, I should say,

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:45.280
of something being higher, something being lower;

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.640
something being good, something being bad.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:56.200
Under such ideas

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:02.000
they combine together and worked out all kind of

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:08.960
aggression all over the world. All over. Not only that,

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:16.600
but also in the families, in the institutions,

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.760
in the organisation,

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.440
thinking that they were very right, they were very good,

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.400
and they tried to aggress other personalities.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.720
So, many people thought 'It's better to fight it back'

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.720
and they started fighting it out collectively

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.960
- it doesn't work out.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.640
This fighting doesn't work out,

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:57.640
because fighting begets

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.440
nothing but murders, killing.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.120
Thus many people were killed.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:14.680
Buddha talked to people of non-resistance,

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.760
and there is history about it

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:27.160
that in one of the great universities in Bihar,

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:32.000
when the aggressive people came in,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.960
they killed all the saints in the name of aggression.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.640
And they all died.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:54.080
Maybe that might have achieved on a very subtler level

00:13:54.440 --> 00:14:01.760
some sort of punyas; but in this Kali Yuga,

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.000
it is not going to work out.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.920
What is the resistance

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.600
you can put in against such people?

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.040
How can you fight them?

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.400
It's an impossible situation

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:26.840
to convince anybody that they are aggressive

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:31.160
and they are nowhere near the Truth.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:37.240
Because nobody wants to accept such a thing.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:43.000
And so whatever they are trying, all over the world,

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:51.160
to convince others of their follies, are completely failing.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:15:01.280
And thus this struggle, this war mongering cannot be cured.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:12.240
We have to accept that human beings are not at that level

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:17.200
to understand what's wrong with them.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:21.240
They do not want to accept.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:26.960
To them, aggression is the only way

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:31.480
they can propound their own goodness.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.640
So what is the solution?

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:44.960
The solution is that we should give all of them Self Realisation.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:51.120
They should get their Self Realisation,

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.760
then only things will improve.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.240
Now, you might say that "Mother

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:01.840
in those days of strife and struggle and fighting,

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:08.960
it will work out. Circumstances will tell them.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:14.200
Life will be so difficult

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:21.320
with all the time weapons hanging on their heads,

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:26.440
that they have to also seek the Truth" .

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:32.000
It has to be done very genuinely.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:39.160
If they are seeking the Truth, they will be surprised

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:46.560
that this world is one, all human beings are one,

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.960
and that is the destiny of human beings.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:56.240
But for that, so many are to be killed,

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.120
so many are to be destroyed,

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:05.120
because they don't learn lesson in an easy way.

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:17.080
Now your job is to give them Self Realisation,

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:23.120
and change the people.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:30.400
That's the real thing you have to do as gurus.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.880
But what are we doing?

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:40.400
We come to Sahaja Yoga with what idea?

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:45.560
You are working only on the periphery

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:50.640
Firstly we are worried about ourselves:

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:57.840
how we can prosper, how can we become better off;

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:05.720
also there is greed. We do not see ourselves,

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:13.320
if we are aggressive, if we are trying to trouble others,

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:19.920
if we have wrong ideas about ourselves, how we torture others.

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:27.960
So first of all you have to cleanse yourself and accept

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:36.440
your own problems, your own misgivings.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:45.600
These are to be faced. And challenge yourself.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:53.720
What are you doing? You are a Sahaja Yogi,

00:18:54.120 --> 00:19:00.680
how can you hate someone? How can you trouble someone?

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.040
How can you torture someone?

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:10.560
This is the beginning of introspection, it's very important.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.680
I can make out a person who meditates,

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:21.040
in the real sense of the word, and the one who just 'meditates'.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:28.720
You should not deceive yourself. If you are deceiving yourself,

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:37.040
then how can you become a guru?

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.720
For becoming a good guru, you have to first of all

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:49.800
be very honest within yourself, and find out

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:54.760
what are you doing, what are you up to, what have you done.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:04.840
We have six enemies, as I have told you.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:25.440
And we justify all these enemies. We think, "It is all right!

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:32.080
After all I did this because of this, I had to do it" .

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:40.560
Somebody would say "I was poor, so I had to be dishonest" .

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:49.960
Another would say that, "I had to tell lies" .

00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:04.720
Another would say that "I had to be immoral" .

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:11.160
This is the biggest thing human beings have is justification!

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:15.840
Animals don't have it. They have their fixed ideas,

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:20.040
they have their fixed 'nature'.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:27.600
But human beings can do all kinds of wrong things and can justify it

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:35.600
This justification doesn't help you in your ascent.

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:40.640
"I did this because of that " .

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.640
It never helps you!

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:52.120
One should try to introspect and see for yourself

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.680
what is the justification.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:06.640
So when you start supporting yourself in doing all kinds of

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:12.400
opposite things, how can you rise?

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:21.560
How can you ascend? All the time you are trying to descend!

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:27.440
So purification within is only possible

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.960
if you can see yourself clearly,

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:39.000
if you can't see how will you purify? If I can't see in the mirror,

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.920
how will I see what's wrong with my face?

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.840
So when you start seeing the Truth,

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.520
and comparing yourself with that,

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:57.120
then only you can clear out yourself.

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:04.320
But the identification should be with the Truth.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:09.240
For example you see in the mirror your face

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.680
and you find something wrong

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:16.160
you are not identified with that wrong,

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:20.240
but you are identified with your own face,

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:25.000
and so you clear it out, cleanse it out.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:30.400
In the same way, if you are identified with your Self

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.320
you cannot get rid of it.

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:43.600
When you are climbing ahead

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:50.440
into the new path of righteousness, of goodness,

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:59.000
of compassion and love, you should see yourself, watch yourself.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:05.120
What are you doing? Where are you going?

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:13.400
How far you are stupid? You should not cheat yourself.

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:22.160
Let others cheat you, let others do whatever they like.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:27.480
Let others try to kill you, but don't you kill yourself!

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:36.200
You don't cheat yourself! So you have your self-respect,

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:40.760
and you have your self-honour,

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:48.480
which you value more than anybody else. And you don't kneel

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:57.040
to anything that will spoil your image in the mirror.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:04.120
This is the first step, is of introspection.

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:16.080
Now what helps for this introspection is your sense of love.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:25.600
Can you love a person who is distressful?

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:32.720
One who is aggressive? One who is hot-tempered?

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.200
One who cheats you?

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:40.840
Can you love such a person? You cannot,

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:48.160
Then how can you love yourself when you have these qualities,

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:52.760
when you do this to yourself?

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:08.280
So the first thing is the pure love for yourself.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:17.160
Pure love. It's such a great thing to have pure love.

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:24.120
Like, you may like to have a very nice bed to sleep;

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:30.560
you may like to have a very beautiful house;

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:35.760
you may like to have all the wealth of the world.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:43.960
But, all this, will it make you love yourself?

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.400
If you love yourself, you don't want anything!

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:59.400
Because you enjoy your Self! To enjoy your Self

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:03.000
is the greatest enjoyment.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.640
So now you have got Self Realisation.

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.560
Means you know what you are,

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.480
you know what beautiful thing you are.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:21.360
When that is so, you should try to love your self.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.560
And when you start loving yourself,

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:29.800
you are not bothered about all non-sensical things.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:36.600
Now this pure love is one of the most beautiful things

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:40.760
you have which you can do to yourself.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:49.560
When you are selfish, you are not loving your self.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:56.480
When you are unkind, you are not loving your self.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:01.120
When you are agressive, you are not loving your self.

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:08.680
Because you are loving all these bad things; but your Self is pure.

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:13.640
It's absolutely pure and beautiful.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:18.840
And it loves all that is beautiful and good.

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:24.960
So this is the beginning of your 'Self' Realisation:

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:30.040
when you realise how important is your Self.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.840
You don't have wrong ideas about yourself,

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:37.440
you don't justify all the wrong things you do,

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:45.640
because you understand that  is a blemish on your Self.

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:51.720
Face yourself in the most honest manner,

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:57.160
and you will be amazed to see how nice it is.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:03.360
Just to see the pure Self shining within you.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:10.480
When that Self starts shining, you start seeing many other things

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:17.800
which you have not seen, so far. And one of them you see

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:26.160
is that love is not only for yourself, but for everyone.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:33.280
It's a pure love for everyone else.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:39.200
It's not only for yourself. It's very surprising:

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:47.240
when you really love yourself then your love is for yourself,

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:55.520
and you start spreading that love

00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:02.240
in such a manner that you beautifully love others.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.640
You don't love for money,

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:13.560
you don't love for some advantage, for some power

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:21.960
or for some gain, but you love for love.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:27.080
Because pure love is so joy-giving.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:32.800
Is so joy-giving that  if there is any such thing that

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.480
'I love somebody because I want to possess that person',

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:43.480
'because I am something great',

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.480
and 'if I love somebody

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:52.280
then that person should feel absolutely obliged'

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:59.160
all these ideas are absolutely of no avail.

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:07.040
Really if you love, then you just love.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.880
You love everyone.

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:16.280
You may say, "Mother, how can you love a crook?" 

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:25.240
Need not go his way. Need not be with him.

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:33.640
Need not have anything to do with him. But if you are pure love,

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:40.240
then he can change, she can change. If they do not,

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:48.440
then you don't bother. Those who come into the ocean of love,

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:57.160
those who are really pure, loving people, they are your friends.

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:02.960
They are the ones who are needed on this earth.

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:08.680
Not the people who are crooks, who cheat you,

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:13.240
who try to dominate you - they are not the ones needed.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:19.080
What we need are the people who are completely drenched

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:23.560
into the purity of love.

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:30.840
So, from love we go to another point which is purity.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:38.680
And the purity is a subject

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:42.040
which has been talked about by many people.

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:50.280
That you should be pure, you should be absolutely open

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:55.880
and people should know everything about you.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:00.400
I don't think that is purity.

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:04.400
Purity is that which purifies others!

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:12.120
If you are a pure person, then others will be purified.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.680
They have to be purified.

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:20.000
Now supposing you have certain ideas about yourself,

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:28.960
you think that you are very highly placed as a Sahaja Yogi

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:37.720
and that you are full of love. Maybe it's all imaginary.

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:42.760
Does it purify others?

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:49.720
Does your purity purify ohters?

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:57.000
Can it give them awakening? Can they be Realised Souls?

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:02.160
And then, how much do you value the purity,

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:07.320
the power of purity? And how many people you give Realisation

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:11.200
Or you have kept it to yourself?

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:18.000
How many places you have been to spread this purity?

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:22.280
Purity has to be spread.

00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:30.840
And without any doubt, in your own purity,

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:36.520
you should do it because it's a very, very powerful thing.

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:40.840
Purity is very powerful.

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:45.480
It may not act on one or two persons, doesn't matter.

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.800
There could be some very,very

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.760
nasty, horrible fellows, doesn`t matter.

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:59.840
But it will have an effect on very many sensitive persons

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:06.520
who want to become Sahaja Yogis.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:15.080
You have to just test it. How people like you

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:19.000
and how they are impressed by you.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:33.440
The Paramchaitanya, this all pervading power of Divine Love,

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:38.960
flows through you because you are pure.

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:47.800
If you are impure, then it will stop at different chakras,

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:56.560
it won't work. So purity of temperament, purity of love

00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:00.760
what does that mean?  That you love somebody

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:08.440
because that person has got spirituality!

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:14.480
You love that person because there is purity,

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:22.440
and you go to places just to spread the purity among them.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.160
A pure person will never create a problem.

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.720
It's the impure person who every day

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:36.400
can start with this problem or that problem and that ...

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:43.000
So the character of a Yogi is

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:52.240
to worship the purity of your own and the purity of others.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.680
It's true that we have to face ourselves everyday.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:05.320
It's true that we have to correct ourselves every day.

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:10.840
It's true that we have to separate ourselves from ourselves

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:15.640
to see how far we have done, how far we have gone,

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:20.440
what are we doing, what have we done.

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:26.240
So the difference between the ancient times guru

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:32.960
and modern times guru is that the ancient times' gurus

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:37.160
didn't care if they gave Realisation to people,

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:42.720
it was not their style most of them.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:46.400
Only they cared for themselves, nicely sitting down

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:52.320
somewhere in the Himalayas, away from all the madding crowd,

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:58.720
and enjoying themselves! But you must share this enjoyment.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:07.080
I think that is the sign of a good guru. The one who cannot share,

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:10.320
only looks after his own pleasures,

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:14.200
or looks after his own ashram, we can call it,

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:18.160
or looks after his own family,

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:23.280
looks after maybe some disciples he has

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:27.800
attention has to be for the whole world!

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:31.480
In Sahaja Yoga, now, it has reached such a stage

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:38.360
that you have to worry about the complete humanity.

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:44.160
It's not only you, or a few Sahaja Yogis,

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:47.120
or many more Sahaja Yogis,

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:52.040
but all over the world, whatever is the problem,

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:55.360
you people have to solve it.

00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:02.040
But first get out of your own little, little problems.

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:07.880
I get letters from people, especially women,

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:12.600
saying their husband is like that, and husband does that

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:17.720
and children are suffering, and all kinds ...

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:26.400
Now, you are a guru! Means you are such a high,

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:31.840
highly electrified person with spirituality.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:37.320
Why should you worry about all this nonsensical things?

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:49.440
And the consciousness that you are purified

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:58.000
and that you are a pure person should make you very humble.

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:04.720
Just the opposite of it - normally people, if they are anything,

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:09.000
they become very proud and think no end of themselves.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:15.440
If they have, say, one power, they will become like that;

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:19.760
if they have some talent, they become like this;

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:24.360
if they have some eminence they become like this

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:28.840
they do not become humble by that

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:33.640
by that achievement they become extremely, extremely

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:38.080
proud, arrogant

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:45.160
absolutely in a very wrong shape!

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:54.280
But you, you are a Sahaja Yogi and you should not mind

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.320
anything that will bring down your purity.

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:20.080
So, you can call yourself as gurus if you want.

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:24.640
I need not say that you are a guru.

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:33.240
But you have to first of all make your self your disciple!

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.160
Must look after your self first of all.

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:49.080
You have to see for yourself, 'Have I got the qualities?

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:54.920
Am I the one who can really do all this?'

00:41:55.480 --> 00:42:01.280
All this introspection within you should be with a very clean heart

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:04.880
and understanding.

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:13.920
Because you are not incarnations, which are born absolutely pure,

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.440
but you are human beings

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:21.560
and you are rising to the level of those incarnations.

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:27.120
So you have to cleanse, you have to watch yourself,

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:31.600
see for yourself and then understand

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:36.160
if you are a Sahaja Yogi - have you got

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:41.960
the beauty of purity and love?

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:50.800
Now this love is not relative, is not conditional,

00:42:53.280 --> 00:43:01.280
is not limited, but it is absolutely like an ocean.

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:08.280
And you like to swim in that ocean,

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:13.360
like to be drenched in that ocean of love.

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:20.040
Formerly guru meant a person who is standing with a big stick.

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:23.240
He used to hit everyone.

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:28.400
Anybody did anything wrong they used to hit and beat them.

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:33.120
We had gurus in music also, and different, different

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:36.000
types of gurus we had in our country.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:43.120
And their speciality was that they used to

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:50.680
absolutely oppress the disciple, control, and then teach

00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:58.800
the knowledge of music, maybe; maybe wrestling, maybe anything.

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:05.760
But in Sahaja Yoga it's very different.

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:12.920
Even the spiritual gurus who were real were like that.

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:16.640
Very harsh.

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:22.040
They used to throw stones at such people.

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:27.240
All kinds of things they used to do

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:34.320
they didn't mean anything bad, but the method I didn't like.

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:38.640
There was a story about a person

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:45.720
who was supposed to be a great guru, and I went to see him.

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:51.480
I had to climb quite a lot because he lived in a small, little cave.

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:56.360
And when I reached there, you see,

00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:00.440
he was very angry within and going on like this, like this

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:05.680
And it was raining so I was completely drenched!

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:13.200
And I went and sat in his little cave.

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:19.760
Then he came back and he asked me a question.

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:26.760
He said: "Mother, it was raining. Normally I can stop the rain,

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:30.080
but you wouldn't allow me to stop the rain. Why?

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:36.520
I could have told him 'Because of your ego'. I didn't.

00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:42.920
I told him in a very sweet manner, "You see, you are a sanyasi

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:48.640
and you have got a sari for me. If I had not got drenched,

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:53.480
I could not have taken your sari from a sanyasi" .

00:45:54.560 --> 00:46:00.480
He completely melted! He had tears in his eyes and fell at My Feet.

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:08.920
So the technique of Sahaja Yoga is like this. It's not anger.

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:18.400
It's not repulsion. It's not hatred. But the technique is such

00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:22.040
by which you suggest your love.

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:29.840
This is how one has to understand

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:36.480
the difference between a Sahaja Yogi guru and other gurus.

00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:46.560
No question of beating your disciple, no question of spoiling,

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:52.800
no question of shouting at them. Love is the most powerful thing!

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.440
Of course it doesn't work on some people, I agree forget them.

00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:02.760
But it works in most of the people because

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:09.360
God has made us out of His love and we have a capacity

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:15.080
to yield to that love and to enjoy that love.

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:24.120
So, for a Sahaja Yogi, what he has to do is to understand

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:30.080
the powers of love. Powers of love,

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:35.280
if you can understand, it will grow within you.

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:39.720
Some people have, some people don't have it.

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:45.880
Try to understand, this Paramchaitanya is nothing

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:53.600
but it is (the) power of God's love or you can say 'Mother's love'!

00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:59.640
This power works so beautifully,

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:07.880
in such a secret manner, that you call it as 'miracle'.

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:14.160
Because you can't see how it has worked.

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:19.080
So first and foremost thing is,

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:26.640
try to develop the sense of love within you.

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:35.080
Understand. There is one problem which is always misunderstood.

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:40.040
Pure love can be very easily understood,

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:50.040
that it gives you joy, that it helps others to improve,

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:55.440
it works in a very subtle manner.

00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:03.080
Now try to remember when you came to Sahaja Yoga,

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:07.760
try to remember how you got your Realisation,

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:13.080
try to remember how you started growing.

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:23.040
These are like the seeds within us of love,

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:29.000
which sprouted. Slowly and gradually we started

00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:34.880
the showers of blessings of love.

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:40.160
Then we started enjoying it and understanding it.

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:45.400
Now at this stage when we are about to become gurus and we are

00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:51.480
already gurus, should be nothing but embodiment of love.

00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:55.960
It's a very different theory I am telling you.

00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:58.240
No guru will accept this

00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:05.280
those who are already accepted as gurus all over.

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:16.560
And the knowledge, knowledge they give you,

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:25.320
is the knowledge of very subtle things.

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:36.080
All the knowledge that you have got in Sahaja Yoga has been already

00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:40.600
told by those gurus long time back.

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:43.120
Somebody has told this, somebody has told that,

00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:47.480
somebody has told that ...

00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:52.800
But all the knowledge, the total knowledge

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:59.240
about your being, your chakras, everything, which you know now,

00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:03.880
is with you. That is the truth.

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:12.520
You have the complete subtle knowledge which nobody had before.

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:18.920
Because maybe these gurus did not want to give,

00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:24.040
or maybe these gurus did not know themselves.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:31.640
All the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga is simple,

00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:39.920
very subtle and is real. Now, after having this within you,

00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:46.760
should not be just mental it should be spiritual.

00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:55.560
And to make it spiritual, what have you to do is to love!

00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:59.440
When you love others, you will start working on them.

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:03.680
Then you will find out, with your knowledge,

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:10.080
that there is something wrong with this fellow: what is wrong?

00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:14.520
He has this chakra, he has that chakra this is the combination,

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:20.280
that is it. But a Sahaja Yogi doesn't get angry on that point.

00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:23.040
He tries to cure that person.

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:31.160
He tries to improve that person.

00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:38.720
He doesn't say "You are very bad, you are horrible" . No, no.

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:45.480
He takes up a challenge that 'With my pure love I can cure'.

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:54.520
It is so simple for him;

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:58.520
not like any doctor or anybody

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:03.760
who has certain great qualifications that he would come and ask for

00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:11.240
the fees and that he will charge you this money nothing!

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:13.680
He knows what's wrong with you

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:19.640
and he knows how to cure it. And he does it that way.

00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:29.840
So, you are not afraid. Apart from... you are not afraid,

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:33.400
that person who is with you also is not afraid

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:38.880
because of your temperament, because of your nature:

00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:43.360
the way you are handling the patient, the way you are

00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:48.640
talking to a person who has come to know about the truth.

00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:56.000
And thus you give him also the truth.

00:53:56.280 --> 00:54:00.160
Also you teach him what is  the truth is.

00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:08.200
And the truth is very simple that you are the Spirit!

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:17.240
This is the truth, is revealed loud to another person.

00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:27.040
Thus you realise yourself, by giving Realisation to another person,

00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:33.440
what you have done is to give him the truth itself

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:37.960
absolute truth.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:49.960
I know... these days people find it very difficult to find any time

00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:56.240
for Sahaja Yoga, for spreading Sahja Yoga

00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:59.680
they are looking out for  holidays.

00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:10.840
Whatever it is, whatever is happening,

00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:17.800
I am very sure with your great powers that you have,

00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:27.120
you can really show great, great success,

00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:35.640
very great success. And this success can bring forth

00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:43.600
the vision I have of saving the humanity all over the world.

00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:49.640
May God bless you
