07:42.300 --> 07:45.460
I bow to all the Sahaja Yogis.

08:09.433 --> 08:13.273
In this beautiful surround, surroundings,

08:15.775 --> 08:26.805
many of you are wondering why God has created these beautiful things.

08:26.885 --> 08:30.725
Because you people had to come on this Earth

08:30.805 --> 08:34.611
and enjoy the beauty that is one of the reasons.

08:34.691 --> 08:40.887
And now God feels very much fulfilled

08:40.967 --> 08:55.933
with the joy and satisfaction and a kind of a completion of His desire.

08:56.014 --> 09:05.315
Why God has created this beautiful universe
has been a question

09:05.395 --> 09:09.100
asked for thousands of years.

09:11.306 --> 09:17.373
The reason is very simple to understand:

09:17.453 --> 09:24.759
this beauty that is created cannot see itself.

09:24.960 --> 09:35.210
In the same way, God who is the source
of beauty, cannot see its own beauty,

09:35.290 --> 09:40.224
like a pearl cannot enter into itself to see its beauty,

09:40.305 --> 09:46.712
like the sky cannot understand its own beauty,

09:46.792 --> 09:52.011
the stars cannot see their own beauty,

09:52.091 --> 10:03.969
the Sun cannot behold its own brilliance.

10:04.050 --> 10:13.858
In the same way God Almighty cannot behold His own being.

10:13.938 --> 10:17.188
He needs a mirror

10:17.268 --> 10:25.132
and that is how He has created this
beautiful universe as His mirror.

10:25.212 --> 10:31.679
In this mirror He has created now beautiful things like the Sun,

10:31.759 --> 10:38.577
then the Sun has to see his own reflection also.

10:40.018 --> 10:45.727
So, he has created these beautiful trees to see that

10:45.807 --> 10:53.299
when he shines, they come up so well and look so green.

10:53.379 --> 10:58.503
Then He has created those birds to rise early in the morning

10:58.583 --> 11:05.850
to greet the Sun, so the Sun knows that: “Yes, I am there, I am existing”;

11:05.930 --> 11:11.820
or else He has created these beautiful lakes
for these trees to see their reflection

11:12.006 --> 11:18.560
and the lakes to feel their existence when the
ripples start moving within themselves.

11:18.740 --> 11:22.210
So then He created human beings.

11:22.290 --> 11:27.139
The human beings cannot also see their own beauty, their own glory.

11:27.219 --> 11:31.370
That is why they are in the darkness, they are ignorant.

11:31.450 --> 11:36.913
They cannot see what lies within themselves.

11:36.993 --> 11:44.269
So they are running after something
which is absolutely against themselves,

11:44.350 --> 11:50.582
which is ugliness, which is self destructive.

11:50.681 --> 11:56.509
And the struggle to get to is such a lot,

11:56.589 --> 11:59.964
that as a result, they destroy themselves.

12:00.045 --> 12:05.432
Like as people have taken to these drugs, taken to all bad
habits

12:05.512 --> 12:08.930
– of in this place, they say a lot of smuggling going on –

12:09.010 --> 12:14.201
and all such endeavors that people take up because they do not know

12:14.281 --> 12:16.840
what beautiful things they are.

12:16.920 --> 12:23.037
So now a mirror has to be created for them,
to see for themselves how beautiful they are.

12:23.118 --> 12:27.171
Their mirror is their Spirit.

12:27.251 --> 12:32.418
That Spirit is to be brought in their consciousness, their attention.

12:32.498 --> 12:37.827
If it comes in their attention then they can see their image.

12:37.920 --> 12:47.928
Now this attention that comes in as an enlightened attention

12:48.008 --> 12:53.980
is called in Sanskrit language as chidabhas

12:54.060 --> 12:59.942
is the expression of the attention which is enlightened.

13:00.022 --> 13:07.164
But it is also said that it is got a nature, which is very transitory,

13:07.244 --> 13:13.156
or, we can say, which is disappearing every moment to moment.

13:13.236 --> 13:17.261
When
this is happening what is to be done?

13:17.341 --> 13:23.396
For that you have to steady yourself with meditation,

13:23.476 --> 13:29.135
with hearing the enlightened talks,

13:29.215 --> 13:38.090
by seeing the good things of life without thinking about them,

13:38.170 --> 13:42.852
by seeing also the goodness of others

13:42.932 --> 13:47.134
and then you start seeing
goodness in yourself also.

13:47.214 --> 13:50.990
That is why I always say that one should not feel guilty.

13:51.070 --> 13:59.322
Because you are feeling guilty of something, which is just, just an illusion.

13:59.416 --> 14:04.347
You are guilty that you have got a shadow. It is something like that.

14:04.427 --> 14:08.022
So if you know that you are beautiful beings

14:08.102 --> 14:13.870
and that you have got a shadow is nothing to do with you and your beauty.

14:13.950 --> 14:20.479
If you can see you own beauty then you will be amazed that within us lies

14:20.560 --> 14:26.748
all those joy giving, all those beautiful
things, which we are seeing outside.

14:26.828 --> 14:29.428
But just now, the mirror is not all right,

14:29.508 --> 14:32.716
that’s
why you have to see in the nature the beauty.

14:32.797 --> 14:43.124
But, when you are one with your Self, then
you see all these nature within yourself,

14:43.205 --> 14:46.860
all the joy giving qualities of this nature within yourself.

14:46.940 --> 14:53.420
So I wanted you to come to this place just
to learn how God has created this beautiful

14:54.846 --> 15:00.027
area for you people to enjoy and to be here.

15:00.107 --> 15:02.240
May God bless you.
