00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.460
I bow to all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:08:09.433 --> 00:08:13.273
In this beautiful surround, surroundings,

00:08:15.775 --> 00:08:26.805
many of you are wondering why God has created these beautiful things.

00:08:26.885 --> 00:08:30.725
Because you people had to come on this Earth

00:08:30.805 --> 00:08:34.611
and enjoy the beauty that is one of the reasons.

00:08:34.691 --> 00:08:40.887
And now God feels very much fulfilled

00:08:40.967 --> 00:08:55.933
with the joy and satisfaction and a kind of a completion of His desire.

00:08:56.014 --> 00:09:05.315
Why God has created this beautiful universe
has been a question

00:09:05.395 --> 00:09:09.100
asked for thousands of years.

00:09:11.306 --> 00:09:17.373
The reason is very simple to understand:

00:09:17.453 --> 00:09:24.759
this beauty that is created cannot see itself.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:35.210
In the same way, God who is the source
of beauty, cannot see its own beauty,

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:40.224
like a pearl cannot enter into itself to see its beauty,

00:09:40.305 --> 00:09:46.712
like the sky cannot understand its own beauty,

00:09:46.792 --> 00:09:52.011
the stars cannot see their own beauty,

00:09:52.091 --> 00:10:03.969
the Sun cannot behold its own brilliance.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:13.858
In the same way God Almighty cannot behold His own being.

00:10:13.938 --> 00:10:17.188
He needs a mirror

00:10:17.268 --> 00:10:25.132
and that is how He has created this
beautiful universe as His mirror.

00:10:25.212 --> 00:10:31.679
In this mirror He has created now beautiful things like the Sun,

00:10:31.759 --> 00:10:38.577
then the Sun has to see his own reflection also.

00:10:40.018 --> 00:10:45.727
So, he has created these beautiful trees to see that

00:10:45.807 --> 00:10:53.299
when he shines, they come up so well and look so green.

00:10:53.379 --> 00:10:58.503
Then He has created those birds to rise early in the morning

00:10:58.583 --> 00:11:05.850
to greet the Sun, so the Sun knows that: “Yes, I am there, I am existing”;

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:11.820
or else He has created these beautiful lakes
for these trees to see their reflection

00:11:12.006 --> 00:11:18.560
and the lakes to feel their existence when the
ripples start moving within themselves.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:22.210
So then He created human beings.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:27.139
The human beings cannot also see their own beauty, their own glory.

00:11:27.219 --> 00:11:31.370
That is why they are in the darkness, they are ignorant.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:36.913
They cannot see what lies within themselves.

00:11:36.993 --> 00:11:44.269
So they are running after something
which is absolutely against themselves,

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:50.582
which is ugliness, which is self destructive.

00:11:50.681 --> 00:11:56.509
And the struggle to get to is such a lot,

00:11:56.589 --> 00:11:59.964
that as a result, they destroy themselves.

00:12:00.045 --> 00:12:05.432
Like as people have taken to these drugs, taken to all bad
habits

00:12:05.512 --> 00:12:08.930
– of in this place, they say a lot of smuggling going on –

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:14.201
and all such endeavors that people take up because they do not know

00:12:14.281 --> 00:12:16.840
what beautiful things they are.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:23.037
So now a mirror has to be created for them,
to see for themselves how beautiful they are.

00:12:23.118 --> 00:12:27.171
Their mirror is their Spirit.

00:12:27.251 --> 00:12:32.418
That Spirit is to be brought in their consciousness, their attention.

00:12:32.498 --> 00:12:37.827
If it comes in their attention then they can see their image.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:47.928
Now this attention that comes in as an enlightened attention

00:12:48.008 --> 00:12:53.980
is called in Sanskrit language as chidabhas

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:59.942
is the expression of the attention which is enlightened.

00:13:00.022 --> 00:13:07.164
But it is also said that it is got a nature, which is very transitory,

00:13:07.244 --> 00:13:13.156
or, we can say, which is disappearing every moment to moment.

00:13:13.236 --> 00:13:17.261
When
this is happening what is to be done?

00:13:17.341 --> 00:13:23.396
For that you have to steady yourself with meditation,

00:13:23.476 --> 00:13:29.135
with hearing the enlightened talks,

00:13:29.215 --> 00:13:38.090
by seeing the good things of life without thinking about them,

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:42.852
by seeing also the goodness of others

00:13:42.932 --> 00:13:47.134
and then you start seeing
goodness in yourself also.

00:13:47.214 --> 00:13:50.990
That is why I always say that one should not feel guilty.

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:59.322
Because you are feeling guilty of something, which is just, just an illusion.

00:13:59.416 --> 00:14:04.347
You are guilty that you have got a shadow. It is something like that.

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:08.022
So if you know that you are beautiful beings

00:14:08.102 --> 00:14:13.870
and that you have got a shadow is nothing to do with you and your beauty.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:20.479
If you can see you own beauty then you will be amazed that within us lies

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:26.748
all those joy giving, all those beautiful
things, which we are seeing outside.

00:14:26.828 --> 00:14:29.428
But just now, the mirror is not all right,

00:14:29.508 --> 00:14:32.716
that’s
why you have to see in the nature the beauty.

00:14:32.797 --> 00:14:43.124
But, when you are one with your Self, then
you see all these nature within yourself,

00:14:43.205 --> 00:14:46.860
all the joy giving qualities of this nature within yourself.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:53.420
So I wanted you to come to this place just
to learn how God has created this beautiful

00:14:54.846 --> 00:15:00.027
area for you people to enjoy and to be here.

00:15:00.107 --> 00:15:02.240
May God bless you.
