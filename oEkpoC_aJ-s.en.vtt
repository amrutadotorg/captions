01:48.010 --> 01:57.510
Modi must have told you very clearly about
how to grow in Sahaja Yog because he’s one

01:57.510 --> 02:06.220
of them who has really taken very positive
step to see that he grows.

02:06.220 --> 02:13.260
Now one has to understand one simple point
about realisation is that, just mere awakening

02:13.260 --> 02:19.580
of the Kundalini is not sufficient, that’s
just the beginning.

02:19.580 --> 02:28.769
You get your realisation but you must become
the tree, you have to grow, you have to become.

02:28.769 --> 02:37.230
If you cannot grow then you have not achieved
what you wanted to be.

02:37.230 --> 02:49.280
And you grow very fast, very fast with meditation
and with understanding about meditation.

02:49.280 --> 02:58.030
Now one of the few hurdles that we have, that
I’ve seen it, that are innately built in

02:58.030 --> 03:00.630
Sahaja Yog itself.

03:00.630 --> 03:06.020
One of them is that you get it spontaneously
so easily that you take it for granted.

03:06.020 --> 03:08.850
This is in the pattern of it, only innately
built.

03:08.850 --> 03:15.210
You see what ever you get so easily you just
take it for granted.

03:15.210 --> 03:21.320
But the another side of it is like that, that
when you have your eyes you don’t know the

03:21.320 --> 03:23.900
value of your eyes, you take it for granted.

03:23.900 --> 03:28.140
But when you don’t have them then you know
the value of eyes, it’s like that.

03:28.140 --> 03:35.410
So when you lose vibrations and when you get
out of Sahaja Yog, then you start feeling

03:35.410 --> 03:43.679
much more lost and then you come back to Sahaja
Yoga again.

03:43.679 --> 03:50.699
Like a person becomes rich, he enjoys the
riches and then you make him poor then he

03:50.699 --> 03:53.080
feels it more.

03:53.080 --> 03:54.550
So this is the correcting point.

03:54.550 --> 04:03.190
But it is very true that Sahaja has this thing
innately built in its self that it all happens

04:03.190 --> 04:10.559
very spontaneously and you get it for doing
nothing at all.

04:10.559 --> 04:21.919
So, may be so many of you may lose it because
you might find that it is just you got it

04:21.919 --> 04:22.919
because of something.

04:22.919 --> 04:28.350
I’ve also known of people they get vibrations
and they say, “Now it’s all right I don’t

04:28.350 --> 04:30.150
need Sahaja Yoga, I am on my own."

04:30.150 --> 04:36.309
Again they’re back like bad pennies with
some troubles and some problems and then they

04:36.309 --> 04:37.309
go out.

04:37.309 --> 04:44.141
Now I would say that Modi is one of those
first twelve people who got realisation, after

04:44.141 --> 04:49.339
two years I’ve worked on them, while you
got realisation in such a short time.

04:49.339 --> 04:56.680
Two years I’ve worked on twenty five people
out of which twelve got realisation you can

04:56.680 --> 05:01.900
imagine, two years! As I’ve told you in
London I’ve worked on six people for four

05:01.900 --> 05:06.979
years to give them realisation.

05:06.979 --> 05:14.750
But once a certain number of people of particular
ideologies of permutations and combinations,

05:14.750 --> 05:21.669
once they get realisation I find the rate
of realisation increases very fast.

05:21.669 --> 05:27.450
Like formally we never use to have anybody
in the program who has been to any other Guru,

05:27.450 --> 05:28.940
just avoid them.

05:28.940 --> 05:35.390
Even up to the point that this Modi himself
used to tell people there’s no program today,

05:35.390 --> 05:36.690
no program.

05:36.690 --> 05:40.100
And they would ring Me up and find out that
there was a program and why they were not

05:40.100 --> 05:41.100
allowed.

05:41.100 --> 05:42.540
They said “Mother we get headaches you see.

05:42.540 --> 05:47.140
They break our necks and they just disturb
us and they are good for nothing."

05:47.140 --> 05:53.040
But now, it’s very different, once we have
built up our strength of collectivity we have

05:53.040 --> 05:57.370
so many channels, things are working out very
differently.

05:57.370 --> 06:04.840
So the value that Modi would attach to his
realisation is much more than you would attach

06:04.840 --> 06:06.560
normally.

06:06.560 --> 06:16.590
Because as you see, first even say to have
a ordinary oil lamp was a problem.

06:16.590 --> 06:19.740
So the oil lamp was very important for people.

06:19.740 --> 06:24.660
They would see to it that they would not use
out all the oil and they were so careful.

06:24.660 --> 06:28.880
But today we have no problem, we have got
electricity we take it for granted.

06:28.880 --> 06:33.670
Only when the electricity goes off we know
what is electricity is.

06:33.670 --> 06:43.400
In the same way your realisation also, when
it is lost you understand the value of it.

06:43.400 --> 06:49.930
But supposing you have just touched it and
then you lose it, then you do not understand.

06:49.930 --> 06:55.470
But if you’ve got it you’ve enjoyed it
then you lose it then you want it back again,

06:55.470 --> 07:01.490
so best thing is to be steadily moving towards
your evolution.

07:01.490 --> 07:08.060
Now after I go away that’s the fears people
have here that people start doubting.

07:08.060 --> 07:11.330
They said, “It happened with people they
started doubting."

07:11.330 --> 07:13.300
Doubting what?

07:13.300 --> 07:17.890
Your doubting yourself is the main point is.

07:17.890 --> 07:21.680
You cannot believe that you can get realisation.

07:21.680 --> 07:24.420
This is the basic.

07:24.420 --> 07:33.450
You see to Me, it seems that you feel that
how can you get realisation?

07:33.450 --> 07:40.450
Only those who are very highly realised souls
know that you are realised, they know that

07:40.450 --> 07:44.840
you have been given realisation, but they
also sometimes ask Me, “Why did you give

07:44.840 --> 07:45.840
them realisation.

07:45.840 --> 07:53.120
What have they done?” Because you also think,
I mean we still have to look forward to something

07:53.120 --> 07:54.440
else.

07:54.440 --> 07:56.550
How can we get realisation, this is the trouble

07:56.550 --> 07:59.540
You don’t believe in yourself.

07:59.540 --> 08:04.580
That’s what you have to have confidence
in yourself and then you’ll have confidence

08:04.580 --> 08:07.270
in Me also.

08:07.270 --> 08:12.170
Because there are so many ways, by which you
can verify.

08:12.170 --> 08:13.210
First of all

08:13.210 --> 08:24.680
you can ask questions to the photograph or
to Me in your heart, about Myself, My relationship

08:24.680 --> 08:31.020
what ever you think could be, what ever you
think, put your imagination and see that what

08:31.020 --> 08:32.950
you think I could have been.

08:32.950 --> 08:34.470
Ask that question.

08:34.470 --> 08:37.510
Your vibrations will answer.

08:37.510 --> 08:44.190
Put your, stretch your imagination to the
last, what could be the last word you could

08:44.190 --> 08:45.750
think of Me.

08:45.750 --> 08:52.030
You see, some people will put doubts saying
that, “Kundalini awakening is very difficult,

08:52.030 --> 08:54.090
it is not easy."

08:54.090 --> 09:00.030
Yes it’s true, it’s not easy, it’s a
very difficult things for human beings.

09:00.030 --> 09:03.280
You just can’t do it, is a fact.

09:03.280 --> 09:12.340
You have to work for days with some guru in
some jungle all alone, seeing nobody, working

09:12.340 --> 09:16.170
out your chakras by chakras, sometimes you
have to starve, sometimes you have to eat,

09:16.170 --> 09:19.910
sometimes you have to breathe, you have to
do all kinds of things.

09:19.910 --> 09:21.300
And then the guru can work out.

09:21.300 --> 09:31.990
But there could be someone who is somehow
the master, could be someone.

09:31.990 --> 09:38.450
Kundalini is the Holy Ghost within you.

09:38.450 --> 09:46.210
So there could be someone like that who can
do the job and that is what it is.

09:46.210 --> 09:53.760
These things put you into doubts, because
you can’t believe it.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.450
In relation to yourself you can’t believe
it.

09:56.450 --> 10:00.630
You can believe in God, you can believe in
Holy Ghost, you can believe in Christ but

10:00.630 --> 10:07.510
you cannot believe that it has any relationship
with you, that you could be that great, that

10:07.510 --> 10:10.440
you could get your realisation.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.350
So just feel it and enjoy it.

10:12.350 --> 10:14.640
First of all, don’t think, that’s why
I say, “Don’t think."

10:14.640 --> 10:17.081
Because as soon as you start thinking, Mr.

10:17.081 --> 10:23.369
Thomas in you will get up and say that “Hello,
this cannot be Self-realisation."

10:23.369 --> 10:24.369
Mr.

10:24.369 --> 10:26.390
Thomas was great, you see.

10:26.390 --> 10:33.040
Christ had all the disciples and I find all
those types around, permutations and combinations

10:33.040 --> 10:37.030
and some how Judas also, but they’re rarely
to be found.

10:37.030 --> 10:45.450
But there are, no doubt and some are Thomas’s,
and these Thomas’ are described as murmuring

10:45.450 --> 10:47.100
souls by Christ Himself.

10:47.100 --> 10:51.850
He said, “These are murmuring souls,”
and they murmur and one murmuring soul comes

10:51.850 --> 10:57.090
to you, another murmuring soul in you joins
hands and you start all murmuring together,

10:57.090 --> 10:58.090
start thinking.

10:58.090 --> 11:02.770
Now at that time what have you to do on rational
grounds is very simple.

11:02.770 --> 11:05.350
What have I done so far?

11:05.350 --> 11:12.180
I’ve done everything, did I get cool breeze?

11:12.180 --> 11:16.040
Did I get my self realisation?

11:16.040 --> 11:20.420
Did I feel my own powers?

11:20.420 --> 11:23.420
Have I been able to feel myself and others?

11:23.420 --> 11:30.110
Because you see your still not fully realised,
you may not be able to feel the vibrations

11:30.110 --> 11:34.890
of another person, neither you will be able
to feel your own vibrations.

11:34.890 --> 11:41.730
But there are so many people here who are
realised and they can feel yours, and they

11:41.730 --> 11:42.810
can verify.

11:42.810 --> 11:49.140
Supposing they ask you, “How is your father?”

11:49.140 --> 11:52.510
There was one gentleman in England he came
and told Me, “Why is everybody asking me

11:52.510 --> 11:53.510
about my father?”

11:53.510 --> 11:57.960
I said, “Because there’s one particular
centre that’s catching,” and I called

11:57.960 --> 12:02.240
a child I said now tell Me, “What is the
centre catching?” She pointed out this one

12:02.240 --> 12:04.110
and I said, “This is the centre."

12:04.110 --> 12:07.280
Everybody is catching on this centre, this
is the father centre so they’re asking you

12:07.280 --> 12:08.390
about your father.

12:08.390 --> 12:12.540
He said, “Yes he’s dead and he died of
cancer and he had this and that,” and we

12:12.540 --> 12:13.980
had to treat him.

12:13.980 --> 12:20.140
For example anorexia is a disease can be cured
by curing this centre.

12:20.140 --> 12:28.110
It’s such a deep knowledge and it is such
an all pervading knowledge.

12:28.110 --> 12:36.520
Because once you know in a tree the sap that
goes to all the leaves and all the ends of

12:36.520 --> 12:41.571
it and if you can move the sap, your attention
can move with the sap, you can know the whole

12:41.571 --> 12:44.060
of the tree.

12:44.060 --> 12:49.160
You cannot know leaves and then know the tree.

12:49.160 --> 12:51.200
How many leaves can you count?

12:51.200 --> 12:56.340
But to know the tree the best thing is to
get to the sap.

12:56.340 --> 13:00.760
To treat a tree is best is to get to its sap,
isn’t it?

13:00.760 --> 13:11.040
In the same way when you go from inside out
then you find that you know yourself and others

13:11.040 --> 13:12.040
very well.

13:12.040 --> 13:15.950
It’s very simple even small children can
do it.

13:15.950 --> 13:22.210
So the first doubt comes about yourself, “Oh
this is one of them” because there’s a

13:22.210 --> 13:23.700
guru shopping going on, you see.

13:23.700 --> 13:30.979
There’s a guru shopping, there’s a float,
you go to one guru to another, to ESPs and

13:30.979 --> 13:38.360
what you call them, all sorts of things, mediums,
and all sorts of things they do with the dead

13:38.360 --> 13:39.950
bodies or anything.

13:39.950 --> 13:43.910
All these things you have been to and you
will have found it.

13:43.910 --> 13:49.930
So now suddenly you have to come to a temple,
where you don’t pay anything and you just

13:49.930 --> 13:50.930
get the blessings.

13:50.930 --> 13:56.630
So can’t believe it, you just can’t believe
it, it’s too much to believe.

13:56.630 --> 13:58.330
This is what happens you get

13:58.330 --> 13:59.330
confused.

13:59.330 --> 14:05.430
You are all ready confused, but confusion
could be over by understanding that something

14:05.430 --> 14:10.100
is happening to you just wait and see, give
it a chance.

14:10.100 --> 14:17.970
There’s no way we can bind you to Sahaja
Yoga, because there’s no mesmerism here.

14:17.970 --> 14:21.560
This is another innately a problem with Sahaja
Yoga.

14:21.560 --> 14:27.700
Second problem I should say is that you’re
too free to do what you like, absolutely free,

14:27.700 --> 14:35.900
there’s no binding force except that you
feel the love of your Mother.

14:35.900 --> 14:39.900
Supposing you are not feeling the vibrations
in your hand, there’s no way of binding

14:39.900 --> 14:42.050
you down to Sahaja Yog, nothing.

14:42.050 --> 14:47.170
We just advise “Go ahead, it will work out,
let it work out."

14:47.170 --> 14:52.020
There is no fees, there’s no registration,
there’s no compulsion, nothing.

14:52.020 --> 14:54.410
It’s your own free will.

14:54.410 --> 14:59.950
If you want to stick on you can stick on,
if you want to go away you can go away.

14:59.950 --> 15:03.090
There’s no force on you of any kind.

15:03.090 --> 15:08.750
There’s no registration of your names with
some fees or anything, I mean you are not

15:08.750 --> 15:11.450
bound to pay anything.

15:11.450 --> 15:14.421
If you paid something then you feel, “All
right I’ve paid for it, so go through it

15:14.421 --> 15:16.010
what ever it is, good or bad..

15:16.010 --> 15:20.170
Supposing you go to see a play and it’s
a horrid play but still you say, “All right

15:20.170 --> 15:22.780
I’ve paid for it so let me go through it."

15:22.780 --> 15:28.500
But that you cannot do with Sahaja Yog because
you’ve not paid.

15:28.500 --> 15:33.130
There’s nobody will force you down, nobody
will go on telephoning to you, “Come along,

15:33.130 --> 15:34.840
please come along,” and all that.

15:34.840 --> 15:38.239
So the attitude has to be changed, it is I
who has to gain.

15:38.239 --> 15:42.130
Say there’s a beautiful spot somewhere.

15:42.130 --> 15:47.489
Now that beautiful spot doesn’t send an
invitation card to anyone, everybody goes

15:47.489 --> 15:48.489
there.

15:48.489 --> 15:52.400
But if you have not yet discovered the beauty
of Sahaja Yog in that way and have not enjoyed

15:52.400 --> 15:55.751
it fully, you’ll have to go again and again
and see for yourself.

15:55.751 --> 16:03.880
It is a deliberation on your side not on the
side of the Sahaja Yogis or Sahaja Yoga.

16:03.880 --> 16:06.710
It’s not going to fall at your feet.

16:06.710 --> 16:12.620
That please come to Sahaja Yoga, please donate
something, nothing of the kind.

16:12.620 --> 16:19.180
If you come you are welcome, if you don’t
come, welcome.

16:19.180 --> 16:24.710
On the contrary, you will be surprised there’s
more rejection than acceptance in Sahaja Yog.

16:24.710 --> 16:26.270
That’s also innately built.

16:26.270 --> 16:30.231
I’ve seen some people who are very insincere
type they just go out from Sahaja Yoga like

16:30.231 --> 16:31.860
a tangent.

16:31.860 --> 16:37.510
There was a gentleman who was very troublesome
to us in Bombay and we didn’t know what

16:37.510 --> 16:46.380
to do with him and he just got transferred
from there and we got rid of him.

16:46.380 --> 16:54.860
So you just go out of Sahaja Yoga like a tangent
and we are saved from the botheration.

16:54.860 --> 16:59.870
Because you must understand, if you have problems,
if you are not all right it’s a problem

16:59.870 --> 17:01.730
for Sahaja Yogis to correct you.

17:01.730 --> 17:08.120
It’s just the other way round, if you understand
this, then you will understand the thing,

17:08.120 --> 17:09.120
what works out.

17:09.120 --> 17:13.910
For example if I have to cure somebody it’s
a problem for Me and not the problem for the

17:13.910 --> 17:16.120
person who’s sick.

17:16.120 --> 17:23.500
Now if the tree has to grow is the problem
for the gardener not for the tree.

17:23.500 --> 17:32.320
So the tree must see to it that it co-operates
with the gardener and gets itself developed.

17:32.320 --> 17:38.380
If this understanding is developed, that it
is I who has to gain, it is I who has to go

17:38.380 --> 17:46.400
forward, Mother has not to gain from me anything,
She wants me to have all my powers manifested.

17:46.400 --> 17:53.950
She wants me to grow through it, if this attitude
is developed then you’ll work hard to grow

17:53.950 --> 17:56.190
and you’ll work it out.

17:56.190 --> 18:01.920
But on the contrary you see at the slightest
protest if you ego stands up and says, “Why,

18:01.920 --> 18:06.190
why should I do this?”

18:06.190 --> 18:12.020
To overcome this hurdle you see, we have to
build up certain stages.

18:12.020 --> 18:16.180
That’s what Modi was telling Me.

18:16.180 --> 18:20.320
That you first become thoughtlessly aware,
see that silence is established.

18:20.320 --> 18:27.230
There are certain things that you do much
later, everybody is not allowed in there,

18:27.230 --> 18:34.680
because truth can be only born by people who
are strong enough to bear it.

18:34.680 --> 18:44.110
That’s why I’m not going to tell you who
am I, till you reach a certain stage, because

18:44.110 --> 18:45.680
you cannot bear the light.

18:45.680 --> 18:48.310
That’s what happened with Christ.

18:48.310 --> 18:52.650
They crucified Him because they could not
bear Him.

18:52.650 --> 18:59.529
Human beings are like that, they can’t even
bear an incarnation of love.

18:59.529 --> 19:03.470
They can’t even bear love, it’s too much
for them.

19:03.470 --> 19:09.400
Even if you give them too much love they get
upset, they get disturbed, they just can’t

19:09.400 --> 19:10.400
bear it.

19:10.400 --> 19:14.991
So you have to build up yourself to come to
a certain stage of understanding of Sahaja

19:14.991 --> 19:15.991
Yoga.

19:15.991 --> 19:17.660
It’s a state, which you achieve.

19:17.660 --> 19:19.620
It’s a state.

19:19.620 --> 19:25.870
You are not to be certified by anyone on the...But
it’s a state where you will start giving

19:25.870 --> 19:32.389
realisation to others and the whole way you’ll
be talking you will be in a very different

19:32.389 --> 19:34.830
manner as if you are completely detached.

19:34.830 --> 19:38.490
You’ll say “It is going, it is coming."

19:38.490 --> 19:39.490
It happens.

19:39.490 --> 19:44.460
You will not say my mother must get, my father
must get, you will never say like that.

19:44.460 --> 19:51.840
Because you’ll understand that the problem
of Sahaja Yoga is that it cannot give to anyone.

19:51.840 --> 19:53.050
Like

19:53.050 --> 20:00.560
the sunshine can shine it is for the trees
to expose themselves to the sunshine and get

20:00.560 --> 20:03.060
the advantage of it.

20:03.060 --> 20:09.450
The sunshine is not going to run after you
all over to see that you get it.

20:09.450 --> 20:18.240
This is the point here, it will shine the
whole day and you take it.

20:18.240 --> 20:23.100
But it’s not that it will run after you
all the time requesting you, “Oh please

20:23.100 --> 20:28.200
get me, oh please get me, have it, have it,”
like that.

20:28.200 --> 20:37.680
And this is what one has to understand very
clearly, that it is you who has to ask for

20:37.680 --> 20:42.600
it, and not anybody is going to force on you
anything.

20:42.600 --> 20:49.570
On the contrary if anybody tries to say something
more your ego gets like that.

20:49.570 --> 20:52.040
So try to be careful.

20:52.040 --> 20:58.180
I am very happy to know that also, that in
all the ego orientated societies I’ve seen

20:58.180 --> 21:00.680
that Sahaja Yoga works like wonders.

21:00.680 --> 21:03.850
Because first thing they see is their colossal
ego.

21:03.850 --> 21:08.350
And that’s a very positive point about it,
because once you start seeing this horrible

21:08.350 --> 21:14.960
balloon in you, you just start watching yourself
and enjoying, “Oh Mr so and now get along

21:14.960 --> 21:15.960
with your ego."

21:15.960 --> 21:18.820
You see it’s a very interesting life you
start leading.

21:18.820 --> 21:25.200
If your ego you see, is a very good sign.

21:25.200 --> 21:28.460
If you cannot see your ego then there’s
danger.

21:28.460 --> 21:32.019
But some can even see their super ego if they’re
possessed.

21:32.019 --> 21:38.240
See people see how they get possessed suddenly
because the frequency of possession becomes

21:38.240 --> 21:46.570
very little so that there’s a big gaps you
see to see the time when you are normal and

21:46.570 --> 21:51.610
when you get abnormal also you can see clearly
that you are abnormal.

21:51.610 --> 21:58.230
By seeing that you start judging, “Oh God
I have again been caught up, I’m again lost,”

21:58.230 --> 22:00.120
and you come back to normal.

22:00.120 --> 22:09.610
The whole thing becomes a very beautiful understanding
of the reality about yourself and you laugh

22:09.610 --> 22:11.730
at yourself all the time.

22:11.730 --> 22:16.460
All the time you laugh at your self and you
laugh at everything and you find the whole

22:16.460 --> 22:21.860
joke going round how people are seriously
indulging into nonsensical things and how

22:21.860 --> 22:28.270
it’s such a big joke you’ve been yourself
worrying about things which have no meaning,

22:28.270 --> 22:30.360
which has no significance.

22:30.360 --> 22:35.810
Like I went first to Paris and people told
Me, “Mother they are not going to like you

22:35.810 --> 22:41.720
very much, because they believe a person who
is so happy is ignorant.

22:41.720 --> 22:43.160
You should not be a happy person.

22:43.160 --> 22:46.509
You should be a crying baby so they’ll believe
You."

22:46.509 --> 22:51.530
They’re all les miserable, very unhappy
people, extremely unhappy and if you tell

22:51.530 --> 22:56.230
them you are a happy person so they are going
to be shocked at such a thing.

22:56.230 --> 23:00.360
I said, “Really this Les Miserable, let
me (inaudible).

23:00.360 --> 23:06.050
Let Me do something about them and I made
them laugh so much at their miseries that

23:06.050 --> 23:10.389
they got all right and they understood that
the joy is just there.

23:10.389 --> 23:15.880
You have to just peep in your heart and you’ll
find the source of your joy and then the whole

23:15.880 --> 23:17.540
thing vanishes into thin air.

23:17.540 --> 23:21.030
But it has to work, it has to happen.

23:21.030 --> 23:29.100
There is no quick way of doing it in the sense
that I say, “All right you give me five

23:29.100 --> 23:32.690
rupees or five dollars, Australian dollars
and you get it."

23:32.690 --> 23:37.120
NO, no, no, no, you may give Me any amount
it won’t work out.

23:37.120 --> 23:40.580
It has not worked out with My own daughters
you’ll be surprised.

23:40.580 --> 23:43.180
I’ve never forced them or I’ve never asked
them.

23:43.180 --> 23:46.580
I’ve only two daughters they’re not realised
I’m not bothered.

23:46.580 --> 23:49.440
When they’ll ask for it they’ll get it.

23:49.440 --> 23:51.600
But My four grandchildren are born realised.

23:51.600 --> 23:57.300
And one of the eldest ones one day very seriously
said, “As it is you cannot commit mistakes

23:57.300 --> 24:05.040
I know but it would have been nice if you
have given them realisation when they were

24:05.040 --> 24:06.040
children."

24:06.040 --> 24:12.090
You see this is what it is that you cannot
force these things on anyone and you have

24:12.090 --> 24:14.930
to take a very detached view.

24:14.930 --> 24:20.350
You are a seeker, your mother and you are
there but they are not your responsibility,

24:20.350 --> 24:22.160
you can tell them about Sahaja Yog.

24:22.160 --> 24:26.139
But if they are opposing you better have,
let them be alone, they’ll come round.

24:26.139 --> 24:31.210
When they see the transformation in within
you, they’ll definitely come.

24:31.210 --> 24:32.940
So leave them alone.

24:32.940 --> 24:35.080
Don’t bother your heads.

24:35.080 --> 24:41.400
Just leave them alone and you will be amazed
that they will see you transforming so well

24:41.400 --> 24:47.600
and acting so well and they’ll change themselves
and they will come to you and ask you, “How

24:47.600 --> 24:55.030
are you so much changed and transformed?”
You see proof of the pudding is in seeing

24:55.030 --> 24:59.990
the pudding up there changing people.

24:59.990 --> 25:06.950
And this transformation you’ll be amazed
coming into you so suddenly that you will

25:06.950 --> 25:09.520
be amazed.

25:09.520 --> 25:16.650
But as I told you that on the left side is
the desire or you can say the super ego, the

25:16.650 --> 25:18.310
desire to do something.

25:18.310 --> 25:26.600
And the right side is the ego which we try
to sort of please and which feels happy and

25:26.600 --> 25:28.330
the one by which we have ambitions.

25:28.330 --> 25:32.519
But in the centre is the will power to do
this.

25:32.519 --> 25:38.310
And this will power has to be increased by
you, “I have to do it, I have to do it."

25:38.310 --> 25:39.710
First you’ll feel tired because

25:39.710 --> 25:43.400
your left heart is weak, then I will tell
you how to do it.

25:43.400 --> 25:46.820
‘Then know how to raise your left heart
if you’re tired.

25:46.820 --> 25:52.620
See most of the people these days are very
tired people.

25:52.620 --> 25:54.840
They talk, “Ah,” they sit down “Ah."

25:54.840 --> 25:59.150
They can’t, I mean they are very tired,
absolutely fagged out people.

25:59.150 --> 26:01.850
Morning till evening what have you been doing,
nothing.

26:01.850 --> 26:07.850
Just sitting in the sun you got tired, just
lazing out you got tired.

26:07.850 --> 26:10.000
Why, why did you get tired?

26:10.000 --> 26:15.060
Firstly because you’re not integrated you
are fighting with in yourself.

26:15.060 --> 26:20.060
You’re head is fighting your heart, your
heart is fighting your liver.

26:20.060 --> 26:24.220
Secondly, you are thinking and wasting your
energy.

26:24.220 --> 26:32.850
So you have to learn how to settle your heart,
what has to be done to raise your heart to

26:32.850 --> 26:38.330
make it peaceful and how to get the energy
from your spirit.

26:38.330 --> 26:42.770
Once you start doing that your tired feeling
will go away.

26:42.770 --> 26:48.850
Then your aggressiveness also will decrease
and you’ll be amazed that you will just

26:48.850 --> 26:50.129
watch the whole thing.

26:50.129 --> 26:56.800
Neither you’ll aggress nor you’ll take
aggression and the whole reaction will be

26:56.800 --> 26:58.220
very different.

26:58.220 --> 27:03.330
Then everything has a meaning, your feelings
have a meaning.

27:03.330 --> 27:08.990
Supposing you have a feeling today for Poland,
which is in trouble, all of you should ask

27:08.990 --> 27:11.910
just now, “Mother solve the problem of Poland."

27:11.910 --> 27:17.200
Because I have no desires you see, I am desire
less, you have to ask and it works, you’ll

27:17.200 --> 27:21.790
be amazed because your attention is enlightened
now, it just works.

27:21.790 --> 27:24.220
You have to desire for it and it works.

27:24.220 --> 27:25.220
You have to work for it and it works.

27:25.220 --> 27:32.050
And so many miraculous things people will
tell you just believe them that’s all true.

27:32.050 --> 27:39.610
Money problem solved, because of Lakshmi Tattwa
within, financial problems solved, social

27:39.610 --> 27:45.060
problem solved, family problems solved because
you are solved.

27:45.060 --> 27:48.070
See in relation to you all everything seems
problematic.

27:48.070 --> 27:52.389
When your problems are solved everything is
solved.

27:52.389 --> 27:54.830
It’s so simple as that.

27:54.830 --> 27:59.990
We have to solve ourselves and it is solved
through the awakening of the Kundalini.

27:59.990 --> 28:05.110
Now I would like to have some questions from
you and then I would like you to go into groups

28:05.110 --> 28:12.139
with the Sahaja Yogis and talk to them on
intimate level and also you must tell Me your

28:12.139 --> 28:13.139
problems.

28:13.139 --> 28:15.889
If you have any intimate problems, you can
talk to Me also.

28:15.889 --> 28:22.820
But best is to talk to each other.
I would like Warren to see to it that he organises

28:22.820 --> 28:24.759
all these groups properly.

28:24.759 --> 28:38.430
But I would love to have some questions from
you about Sahaja Yoga now.

28:38.430 --> 28:43.520
Question: How can one laugh at abortion.

28:43.520 --> 28:49.970
He's talking about abortion, you are taking
the view that it is bad?

28:49.970 --> 28:57.450
Shri Mataji: I’m not saying you have to,
I said you are not to laugh, means you laugh

28:57.450 --> 29:00.740
at silly stupid things I meant, you see.

29:00.740 --> 29:06.210
But at abortion as I can’t understand you
see.

29:06.210 --> 29:08.550
This is a very funny situation in this country.

29:08.550 --> 29:11.730
As it is the birth rate is minus and you are
having abortions.

29:11.730 --> 29:15.330
Question: Does it exist in India much abortion

29:15.330 --> 29:18.720
Shri Mataji: Not much, people don’t like
it at all, they hate it.

29:18.720 --> 29:21.860
And you know the trouble is like this.

29:21.860 --> 29:25.860
You people are having no children so we have
to have the load on us.

29:25.860 --> 29:28.110
You see what to do?

29:28.110 --> 29:32.470
Nobody to be born here, they don’t want
to be born here because there is no love in

29:32.470 --> 29:34.160
the heart.

29:34.160 --> 29:38.269
See when the other day when somebody told
Me about the doctors here some of them are

29:38.269 --> 29:40.920
butchers I couldn’t believe it.

29:40.920 --> 29:44.190
Because in India at least, doctors are not
butchers by any chance.

29:44.190 --> 29:48.940
I was surprised; this is because everything
has become a butchery here, because the heart

29:48.940 --> 29:50.970
is covered with ego.

29:50.970 --> 29:53.540
There’s no heart left.

29:53.540 --> 29:55.160
You have to raise the heart.

29:55.160 --> 30:01.340
That’s important, once you raise the heart,
you see you cannot stand all this nonsense,

30:01.340 --> 30:02.340
you know.

30:02.340 --> 30:04.370
Why do you want to have abortion I still can’t
understand?

30:04.370 --> 30:07.110
Question: Does it affect Swadisthan charka?

30:07.110 --> 30:11.420
Shri Mataji: Oh, it affects many chakras,
I mean.

30:11.420 --> 30:18.090
There was someone I knew who always used to
catch on right heart, I must tell you this,

30:18.090 --> 30:20.340
very nice person, always on right heart.

30:20.340 --> 30:27.610
His father was a good man everything was fine,
asked him, “How are you catching on right

30:27.610 --> 30:33.370
heart?” He was not married and when he came
very close to Me then he confessed to Me that,

30:33.370 --> 30:40.820
“I lived with a woman and she was going
to have a baby and she went in for an abortion

30:40.820 --> 30:45.120
and I conceded, and since then

30:45.120 --> 30:49.879
I have been feeling very sad about the whole
thing."

30:49.879 --> 30:56.889
But the whole view about life has to be changed
then only you can avoid these things.

30:56.889 --> 30:59.519
You see it is a symptom of a disease.

30:59.519 --> 31:05.629
It’s not the disease itself, abortion is
not the disease, is a symptom of a disease.

31:05.629 --> 31:12.770
Now what is the disease with in us is, is
that, that we have allowed our sex to be let

31:12.770 --> 31:16.330
loose completely, talking too much about sex
from childhood.

31:16.330 --> 31:19.920
What is the need to give education in sex,
I’ve been failed to understand?

31:19.920 --> 31:25.570
Openly, there’s no need to teach about,
you see, do the animals need any sex education,

31:25.570 --> 31:27.690
they still produce.

31:27.690 --> 31:35.530
Then they told Me, “They tell about sex
only because they think by telling about sex

31:35.530 --> 31:38.389
they can protect people from not going into
sex."

31:38.389 --> 31:42.320
I said, “No, they create too much of curiosity
in children."

31:42.320 --> 31:47.830
For example, in India we never talk about
sex to children, they do not know, they are

31:47.830 --> 31:48.830
so innocent.

31:48.830 --> 31:54.460
Even till the marriage takes place some of
the girls do not know what sex actually is,

31:54.460 --> 31:55.990
how it works out and all.

31:55.990 --> 32:01.580
But they are told this is something filthy
to do and all that and when the girl gets

32:01.580 --> 32:07.420
into puberty it is told and to the boys also,
somehow or other it is a very different society.

32:07.420 --> 32:11.150
This question doesn’t come, it never comes
into the head of the boys and girls.

32:11.150 --> 32:16.900
You see if you keep them pure, like it doesn’t
come in the head of a sister and a brother

32:16.900 --> 32:20.139
even today, thank God.

32:20.139 --> 32:24.650
Many sisters and brothers I should say despite
Freud’s all efforts to spoil your minds,

32:24.650 --> 32:27.110
but still there are brothers and sisters relations
today.

32:27.110 --> 32:33.690
In the same way it doesn’t come into their
heads at all.

32:33.690 --> 32:38.620
And when they get married they are to be told,
this is what it is.

32:38.620 --> 32:43.310
And that’s why they say these koarak and
all these places were built where they could

32:43.310 --> 32:47.860
take young brides and young people to see
that.

32:47.860 --> 32:54.300
This was called as Koomari Kar Temple, means
the married women when they were not virgins

32:54.300 --> 33:01.230
could go there and see those places to understand
what is sex is and they got so exhausted with

33:01.230 --> 33:05.660
this early sex life, I mean you go into all
kinds of tantrums then.

33:05.660 --> 33:08.750
Because you’re so exhausted then you go
into perversions.

33:08.750 --> 33:10.369
The basics are wrong.

33:10.369 --> 33:13.980
We are trying too hard to be sexologists.

33:13.980 --> 33:19.570
There’s no need to be sex points you are
that already.

33:19.570 --> 33:24.889
But you don’t want to be only sex points,
do you?

33:24.889 --> 33:35.531
I don’t know what makes you feel that that
is the end of every, every endeavor, everything

33:35.531 --> 33:36.710
should end up there.

33:36.710 --> 33:41.769
May be that advertisement and all this is
coming to you too much because they think

33:41.769 --> 33:44.360
that by exploiting these things they will
help you.

33:44.360 --> 33:58.790
But it’s such a perverted thing and

33:58.790 --> 34:13.810
Seeker interrupts and asks Shri Mataji about
people in India being given a gift like a

34:13.810 --> 34:15.570
transistor radio for sterilization.

34:15.570 --> 34:18.870
Does it have a purpose?

34:18.870 --> 34:28.040
It has a purpose to a point.....Oh I'm sorry
this has another point....

34:28.040 --> 34:32.820
He is talking about in India where they give
a transistor radio....

34:32.820 --> 34:40.509
Shri Mataji: That’s what they try, this
is also, you see western ideas coming to India.

34:40.509 --> 34:43.930
Oh, they did all sorts just to sterilise them.

34:43.930 --> 34:48.320
Oh! that’s how the lady lost her last election,
last election she has now pulled her ears

34:48.320 --> 34:49.320
for that.

34:49.320 --> 34:53.850
You see, they are all westernised people you
see, they try to try all these tricks in....

34:53.850 --> 34:55.550
People don’t like it you see.

34:55.550 --> 35:08.660
There’s a bridegroom who went for his wedding
and poor thing saw that there was a team of

35:08.660 --> 35:10.379
people standing there for sterilisation.

35:10.379 --> 35:18.480
He jumped out of the bus and he disappeared
forever, nobody knows where he is, disappeared.

35:18.480 --> 35:24.840
‘And they even sterilised people who were
very old and who were not even married you

35:24.840 --> 35:25.840
see.

35:25.840 --> 35:30.250
It’s so funny, so indiscriminate, I think
they were possessed by some bhoots I don’t

35:30.250 --> 35:31.610
know what to call them.

35:31.610 --> 35:40.020
You see population is a problem in India but
what to do now, you should solve the problem.

35:40.020 --> 35:43.860
And there is something working out in a very
funny way, I must tell you.

35:43.860 --> 35:49.160
I went to Colombia, I found lots of these
Norwegians carrying Colombian children with

35:49.160 --> 35:50.160
them.

35:50.160 --> 35:54.619
And they looked so different from Norwegian
children, Norwegian people and these Colombian

35:54.619 --> 35:55.619
children.

35:55.619 --> 35:58.879
I asked them, “Why do you acquire these
children where are you carrying them?

35:58.879 --> 36:04.099
They said “We have adopted them”.
I said, “Why don’t you produce your own?

36:04.099 --> 36:05.920
That would be better, to produce your own."

36:05.920 --> 36:12.750
"No we don’t want to go through the process
of it, it’s better to have ready made."

36:12.750 --> 36:19.170
So the supply has started in having all this
in developing countries to give you ready

36:19.170 --> 36:20.170
made children.

36:20.170 --> 36:25.499
Isn’t if funny, it’s funny things going
on, instant babies.

36:25.499 --> 36:36.079
Question: If a chakra is blocked and you clean
the chakras wouldn’t you being undoing the

36:36.079 --> 36:42.309
karmic cycle that a person has to go through?

36:42.309 --> 36:48.421
Shri Mataji: Very good idea, Because I think
you people...I know the question is this,

36:48.421 --> 36:53.939
that he is saying that if you try to clean
the chakras you will be undoing the karmic

36:53.939 --> 37:00.969
cycle and all that you see this is the typical
things that are being circulated in the west

37:00.969 --> 37:01.989
you see.

37:01.989 --> 37:07.100
That you have your own karmas you see and
we are the gurus so you have to go through

37:07.100 --> 37:11.140
your karmas, you must suffer for your karmas
you see like that is there.

37:11.140 --> 37:17.630
Now, this theory was all right before Christ
came in, not after His coming.

37:17.630 --> 37:19.959
And why are they here then?

37:19.959 --> 37:22.679
Why are we paying them, for what?

37:22.679 --> 37:24.509
You better pickle them out.

37:24.509 --> 37:29.410
They’re worth nothing because they just
take money from you, and we have to go through

37:29.410 --> 37:30.410
our karmas.

37:30.410 --> 37:33.410
They make you dance, jump go into all kinds
of things.

37:33.410 --> 37:36.489
Put spirits in us and say, “You are suffering
your karmas.

37:36.489 --> 37:42.850
Why should we suffer?” At least they should
suffer for our karma’s minimum of minimum.

37:42.850 --> 37:44.979
Now Christ has done that for you.

37:44.979 --> 37:49.380
He has taken all these karmas, your karmas
upon Himself.

37:49.380 --> 37:55.459
He has made way for us, that’s why you have
to pass through Him.

37:55.459 --> 38:03.100
Once you pass through Him, through Agnya chakra,
your karmas are sucked in by Him, that’s

38:03.100 --> 38:04.499
your ego.

38:04.499 --> 38:09.309
It’s the only ego that says you have done
this wrong, and that wrong.

38:09.309 --> 38:14.039
You see an animal doesn’t think that way.

38:14.039 --> 38:17.719
It thinks it’s it own sva bhavah the way
it has to be.

38:17.719 --> 38:22.340
But it’s only the human beings who think
I’ve done this wrong, I’ve done that wrong.

38:22.340 --> 38:25.460
I’ve done this good, that bad because we
have ego.

38:25.460 --> 38:35.400
But when your Kundalini passes through your
Agnya chakra your ego is sucked in, your superego

38:35.400 --> 38:36.400
is sucked in.

38:36.400 --> 38:41.059
Christ has done double job in one shot you
know, it’s great.

38:41.059 --> 38:48.380
That’s why He was crucified, it was to be.

38:48.380 --> 38:56.120
He took all your karmas upon Himself and put
it into hell.

38:56.120 --> 39:03.179
So what ever karmas you have done are all
sucked in.

39:03.179 --> 39:05.420
But the door must open fully.

39:05.420 --> 39:10.739
In the beginning it happens that only a thread
comes up, you see, and the ego is not fully

39:10.739 --> 39:14.850
sucked in so sometimes it still comes up and
all that.

39:14.850 --> 39:19.690
The best weapon to get rid of them is to forgive
others.

39:19.690 --> 39:26.509
Forgiveness is the greatest weapon Christ
has given us, which we have to use, forgive,

39:26.509 --> 39:28.430
forgive and forgive.

39:28.430 --> 39:37.529
That’s a very good way, Lords Prayer is
the solution for your Agnya charka, you’ll

39:37.529 --> 39:38.610
be amazed.

39:38.610 --> 39:44.170
You have to say Lords Prayer after realisation
to open your Agnya.

39:44.170 --> 39:46.380
Then you become thoughtlessly aware.

39:46.380 --> 39:50.840
After realisation again I say, not before
realisation, it has no meaning.

39:50.840 --> 39:54.829
Before realisation what ever you have said
has gone into karmas.

39:54.829 --> 40:02.079
Only after realisation you are baptized and
get an opening here and all your karmas pass

40:02.079 --> 40:05.499
through that.

40:05.499 --> 40:09.679
Also you will find when you get realisation
lot of heat comes out these are the karmas

40:09.679 --> 40:13.100
you see, that are coming out.

40:13.100 --> 40:16.940
Let the heat go out and all karmas are finished.

40:16.940 --> 40:18.640
It’s like that.

40:18.640 --> 40:21.739
This is what is Self-Realisation.

40:21.739 --> 40:31.400
Like an egg is in a egg shell is very different,
but when it becomes a little chick and the

40:31.400 --> 40:41.449
mother breaks the tip of the egg a new bird
comes out with out any karmas or the smell

40:41.449 --> 40:43.699
of the egg.

40:43.699 --> 40:48.920
So clean and nice, every thing converted into
something beautiful.

40:48.920 --> 40:55.140
It’s like that, this is the rebirth.

40:55.140 --> 41:00.160
This is how we become a new personality a
new being.

41:00.160 --> 41:03.203
So to forget about your karmas after your
realisation, all right.

41:03.203 --> 41:06.059
He has said it

41:06.059 --> 41:11.699
that, “He died for your sins."

41:11.699 --> 41:14.650
Didn’t He?

41:14.650 --> 41:17.779
And the wages of sin is fear.

41:17.779 --> 41:22.630
If you still have fear within you of your
karmas, you are still sinning.

41:22.630 --> 41:26.559
There should be no fear about it.

41:26.559 --> 41:32.249
Do not have any guilt, I’ve been telling
you not to have any guilt.

41:32.249 --> 41:35.220
What can you do?

41:35.220 --> 41:36.220
What sins can you commit?

41:36.220 --> 41:40.150
Do not have any fears.

41:40.150 --> 41:45.590
This is very common as I told you the other
day left Vishuddhi, I have to talk about it

41:45.590 --> 41:46.590
quite a lot.

41:46.590 --> 41:51.920
It’s so common, in Australia, in America
and in all the western countries, to feel

41:51.920 --> 41:52.920
guilty.

41:52.920 --> 41:57.410
Everything collapses there and nobody can
rise through the Agnya because it collapses

41:57.410 --> 42:00.630
down here onto left Vishuddhi where you feel
guilty.

42:00.630 --> 42:02.650
What are you feeling guilty about?

42:02.650 --> 42:04.640
And why did Christ come on this earth.

42:04.640 --> 42:07.170
You are just wasting His incarnation by feeling
guilty yourself.

42:07.170 --> 42:11.809
He has taken all your guilt upon Himself.

42:11.809 --> 42:15.079
What do you thing He was?

42:15.079 --> 42:22.799
He was Omkara, he was Pranava, He was the
word, He was that power.

42:22.799 --> 42:33.020
He’s not attached to anything but He can
take away everything that you think is sin,

42:33.020 --> 42:38.009
because He’s sinless, He so pure, immaculate.

42:38.009 --> 42:41.749
All right does that give you some hopes?

42:41.749 --> 42:46.400
Or still you are indulging into your own miseries?

42:46.400 --> 42:50.729
Question: Can You give us some guide about
diet.

42:50.729 --> 42:52.179
Shri Mataji: Diet?

42:52.179 --> 42:53.179
All right.

42:53.179 --> 42:57.559
This diet theory is also coming from some
horrible Brahmins you see.

42:57.559 --> 42:59.749
Don’t listen to them.

42:59.749 --> 43:04.219
They are the greatest rakshasas ever born
on this earth.

43:04.219 --> 43:07.069
Devils, rakshasas are monsters.

43:07.069 --> 43:12.601
They eat like hell, they eat such a lot and
they always tell you, “Don’t do this and

43:12.601 --> 43:16.999
don’t do that."

43:16.999 --> 43:23.650
You can eat anything you like except don’t
eat the meat of animals which are bigger than

43:23.650 --> 43:24.650
you.

43:24.650 --> 43:31.660
I mean other wise you will develop muscles
which will have funny contours and things.

43:31.660 --> 43:38.249
Eat animals which are smaller than you is
the point is.

43:38.249 --> 43:46.799
And if you eat those animals they do not also
have much sense of compassion and all that.

43:46.799 --> 43:51.380
It’s all right they are just like vegetables
sort of things, so it doesn’t matter.

43:51.380 --> 43:55.480
You don’t kill them, they are killed in
the machine and all that, you have to eat

43:55.480 --> 43:57.880
that, and you need it, you have to eat.

43:57.880 --> 44:01.840
But that doesn’t mean that if you are vegetarians
you should become non vegetarians.

44:01.840 --> 44:03.039
It doesn’t mean that.

44:03.039 --> 44:04.579
What ever you eat, you can eat.

44:04.579 --> 44:08.600
Eating is not going to change your spirit.

44:08.600 --> 44:21.259
Spirit doesn’t eat, it does not, makes no
difference to the spirit except that, to your

44:21.259 --> 44:25.049
body which is the lamp.

44:25.049 --> 44:29.169
So if you have to keep the wick all right,
you have to keep the lamp all right and for

44:29.169 --> 44:34.309
that don’t eat anything that is a very big
animal compared to yourself.

44:34.309 --> 44:38.620
Cows meat for example in India they don’t
eat, because, “Have you ever seen Indian

44:38.620 --> 44:40.900
cows they’re very gentle."

44:40.900 --> 44:46.259
And the cows are in the house, just like mother
they start giving milk to the children they

44:46.259 --> 44:47.259
see.

44:47.259 --> 44:51.140
Every day they are taking the milk of the
cows so they develop a feeling, you see.

44:51.140 --> 44:52.929
And that’s why they don’t drink, you see.

44:52.929 --> 44:57.610
But it doesn’t mean that if your Australian
cows are I don’t think are like that.

44:57.610 --> 45:04.489
Because what I’ve seen they look like buffalos
to Me sometimes.

45:04.489 --> 45:10.350
Like My granddaughter, she came to England
and she asked Me, “Mother, Grandmother,

45:10.350 --> 45:15.170
why the buffalos in England are white?”
Yes, so, it’s all right.

45:15.170 --> 45:17.650
But you’ll come down on diet.

45:17.650 --> 45:20.110
It will be different you see, you’ll see
gradually.

45:20.110 --> 45:21.789
But don’t worry about it.

45:21.789 --> 45:25.410
Gradually everything drops out into very little
things.

45:25.410 --> 45:27.280
But you allow yourself to develop.

45:27.280 --> 45:28.280
Question: Eggs?

45:28.280 --> 45:29.280
And things like that?

45:29.280 --> 45:31.400
Shri Mataji: Oh, eggs you better have, lots
of it.

45:31.400 --> 45:33.840
But if you have liver it’s not good to have
eggs.

45:33.840 --> 45:38.700
Eggs is very heating,, pork is otherwise good
but not good for the people who have liver

45:38.700 --> 45:39.700
problem.

45:39.700 --> 45:42.079
See you must understand that every person
is different.

45:42.079 --> 45:44.870
Now today I met a lady who is very left sided.

45:44.870 --> 45:47.229
So I had to tell her, “You eat pork, eggs
everything.

45:47.229 --> 45:49.739
You see it is how you are.

45:49.739 --> 45:51.329
Even the Indian Ayurveda is like that.

45:51.329 --> 45:56.569
They want to know the prakruti, the character
of a person how he is.

45:56.569 --> 45:59.669
We have evolved from different types of animals.

45:59.669 --> 46:01.410
I saw the nocturnal ones.

46:01.410 --> 46:06.850
You see the nocturnal ones must eat a lot
of meats, those who have evolved from nocturnal

46:06.850 --> 46:07.850
side, you see.

46:07.850 --> 46:13.499
Left-sided, the ones who are afraid and frightened
and who are not egoistical at all you see.

46:13.499 --> 46:18.660
Such types they should take more meats and
things but those who are too much aggressive

46:18.660 --> 46:21.009
better take to vegetables, is better.

46:21.009 --> 46:26.840
All right now, what’s the question?

46:26.840 --> 46:36.960
Question: Does forgiveness stop the rich getting
richer and the poor getting poorer?

46:36.960 --> 46:38.969
Shri Mataji: It does absolutely, absolutely.

46:38.969 --> 46:43.690
Sahaja Yoga is the thing that balances the
society.

46:43.690 --> 46:51.179
Those who are poor become richer and the rich
understand that they must share.

46:51.179 --> 46:57.100
Willingly they start sharing their money.

46:57.100 --> 47:01.150
But you become really rich in a very miraculous
manner.

47:01.150 --> 47:05.759
Now there’s a girl here and I would like
her to tell you what happened to her, it’s

47:05.759 --> 47:06.759
miraculous.

47:06.759 --> 47:10.039
But she’s an Australian and she doesn’t
tell lies you can see that very clearly and

47:10.039 --> 47:13.539
she’ll tell you what happened to her.

47:13.539 --> 47:18.989
Where is she gone?

47:18.989 --> 47:22.640
Sharon come along..is she here?

47:22.640 --> 47:31.410
No let her tell, is better, she’s Australian
they’ll believe her more.

47:31.410 --> 47:37.259
But never trust an Indian that’s even worse.

47:37.259 --> 47:44.269
You know some of the gurus have introduced
some Indian bhoots, Indian spirits into English

47:44.269 --> 47:50.370
people, and Americans and also European and
I find they behave just like Indians.

47:50.370 --> 47:54.470
They’ll cheat, they embezzle, they’ll
take away things, not the women, they’ll

47:54.470 --> 47:56.299
not touch the women you see.

47:56.299 --> 48:02.719
But they’ll touch the things they take away
the empty cans, is typical Indian you see.

48:02.719 --> 48:04.209
It’s rather

48:04.209 --> 48:09.779
surprising, yes there are some, I’ve seen
them like that.

48:09.779 --> 48:15.329
It’s surprising to see such things happening
to a western person who behaves just like

48:15.329 --> 48:21.499
an Indian must be some possession of bhoots
put by these gurus.

48:21.499 --> 48:28.539
So if you believe Me then I can tell you what
she’s told, it’s really miraculous, very

48:28.539 --> 48:30.299
miraculous, you see.

48:30.299 --> 48:36.400
Cheryl was telling Me that she wanted to come
to India and she had no money.

48:36.400 --> 48:46.999
So her daughter was very anxious to come to
India and they didn’t know what to do, they

48:46.999 --> 48:47.999
didn’t have sufficient money.

48:47.999 --> 48:55.999
So they just said, “Mother we want to come
to India can you arrange it for us, that’s

48:55.999 --> 48:56.999
all."

48:56.999 --> 49:01.140
And it so happened that this girl had taken
a trinket she had in the house, a bracelet

49:01.140 --> 49:04.880
to the school for a sale, whenever they have
the fetes all over.

49:04.880 --> 49:09.509
So she took that for the fete and the teacher
said, “I think this is gold."

49:09.509 --> 49:12.269
She couldn’t believe it.

49:12.269 --> 49:17.019
She brought it home and they got it valued
and they found that the price of the thing

49:17.019 --> 49:21.419
was equal to what they had to spend for both
of them travels.

49:21.419 --> 49:23.269
But this is nothing.

49:23.269 --> 49:26.779
And then she got some money from somewhere
in the house, somewhere I don’t know how

49:26.779 --> 49:29.749
she got some money and she didn’t sell even
the bracelet.

49:29.749 --> 49:31.910
And that’s still there she said, “For
the next trip."

49:31.910 --> 49:34.670
I said, “I hope so, you sell it."

49:34.670 --> 49:35.670
“May not."

49:35.670 --> 49:42.660
Like that you see, things work out, because
your Laxshmi Tattawa, your centre of well

49:42.660 --> 49:45.640
being gets enlightened and then you are looked
after.

49:45.640 --> 49:47.360
So many things happen.

49:47.360 --> 49:54.239
Like today they told Me so many things of
this kind happening to them and I too.

49:54.239 --> 49:59.709
You see when these people came in, I had told
them all right, you give Me so much money

49:59.709 --> 50:02.110
may be required for your stay there.

50:02.110 --> 50:07.499
Very little it was, very little for them to
be there in India after all, you see India

50:07.499 --> 50:10.319
is also now becoming very expensive.

50:10.319 --> 50:14.219
And when I went to India I had discovered
it had become very expensive, doesn’t matter

50:14.219 --> 50:15.499
I said, “I’ll put it in the bank.

50:15.499 --> 50:16.919
“Let it be there."

50:16.919 --> 50:23.120
And anybody ask Me, “Have it, you want it,
have it, now spend go,” and it was all right.

50:23.120 --> 50:28.669
I could manage, see that’s what he did,
and so many of them have done it.

50:28.669 --> 50:29.969
It’s looked after.

50:29.969 --> 50:35.920
You go to right places, you get right things,
don’t spend too much, you do not repent

50:35.920 --> 50:41.729
for spending and you feel happy for whatever
you have.

50:41.729 --> 50:46.549
You feel very joyous, not worried about counting
but if you make a budget you had it.

50:46.549 --> 50:53.400
You don’t worry your head about budgeting,
how much your going to spend, you’ll be

50:53.400 --> 50:54.400
surprised.

50:54.400 --> 50:56.380
You won’t go to things which are unnecessary,
useless but you’ll buy something that is

50:56.380 --> 51:03.620
very good and ultimately these things will
be very precious for you to sell.

51:03.620 --> 51:06.729
Many things have happened like that.

51:06.729 --> 51:10.979
Many things have happened.

51:10.979 --> 51:15.140
Question: Why is Australia important for the
future?

51:15.140 --> 51:17.370
Maybe about Shri Ganesha?

51:17.370 --> 51:22.669
Shri Mataji: Only thing I don’t want to
pamper the ego.

51:22.669 --> 51:26.610
Question: Is Australia blessed?

51:26.610 --> 51:29.870
Shri Mataji: Very much, very much blessed.

51:29.870 --> 51:39.019
It’s a very much blessed place, specially
created.

51:39.019 --> 51:48.519
Australia was the first continent to be created
and if I dare to answer this question, I hope

51:48.519 --> 51:54.059
you’ll believe Me and not get into ego trips.

51:54.059 --> 52:08.519
Australia is a place which is described in
the ancient Puranas that a great saint was

52:08.519 --> 52:16.340
sent to Australia and another heaven was created.

52:16.340 --> 52:26.239
And that saint is called as Thrishanku which
is your Southern Cross...what do you call

52:26.239 --> 52:28.169
that?

52:28.169 --> 52:32.329
That shows the Southern Cross and you can
only see Southern Cross from Australia.

52:32.329 --> 52:43.360
This is one of the Puranas, the Vedas have
also mentioned this and even before that Australia

52:43.360 --> 52:45.279
is the place which has the Ganesha.

52:45.279 --> 52:53.660
The first is the Mooladhara Chakra, the first
centre is in Australia.

52:53.660 --> 52:57.759
How much wise you should be.

52:57.759 --> 53:03.620
Did you hear Me?

53:03.620 --> 53:12.219
Question: She wanted your opinion about the
Australian aboriginals.

53:12.219 --> 53:19.809
Shri Mataji: Oh, they must have been good
people to begin with, I am sure of it.

53:19.809 --> 53:28.710
They must have been very good and holy people
and nice people but I think later on they

53:28.710 --> 53:37.209
deviated because of too much jungles and things
you know, they started feeling the fear of

53:37.209 --> 53:38.569
the nature too much.

53:38.569 --> 53:46.590
They must have worshiped things, which were
good to begin with and later on to some things

53:46.590 --> 53:49.370
like spirits and this.

53:49.370 --> 53:55.610
More over the dead bodies the way they disposed
of must have been something wrong.

53:55.610 --> 54:04.890
So maybe they might have gone into a left
sided action into primitive ways of exciting

54:04.890 --> 54:05.890
these bhoots

54:05.890 --> 54:09.600
and things, spirits and spiritualism and all
that.

54:09.600 --> 54:13.920
But in Australia must be the minimum, in Africa
is horrible.

54:13.920 --> 54:19.699
African countries have too much of it but
it should be the minimum of minimum because

54:19.699 --> 54:25.489
you see, Ganesha’s chakra is connected with
the left side, you see is more on the left

54:25.489 --> 54:26.989
side isn’t it?

54:26.989 --> 54:34.799
So also one can go drift more on to the left
side that is what it is.

54:34.799 --> 54:41.279
And even today I feel there’s kind of a
lurking inferiority complex that works in

54:41.279 --> 54:42.279
Australians.

54:42.279 --> 54:46.799
They try to copy the west, there’s nothing
to copy there, they’ve nothing sensible.

54:46.799 --> 54:48.989
They have to learn from you.

54:48.989 --> 54:52.979
You see this is a little inferiority complex
we have that all the best things are in the

54:52.979 --> 54:53.979
west.

54:53.979 --> 54:58.509
That’s wrong, you are much better of in
so many ways.

54:58.509 --> 55:01.160
At least you’ve not lost your moorings.

55:01.160 --> 55:07.900
So I would not pass a general remark about
a community as such but there is a possibility

55:07.900 --> 55:09.660
that they can come up very well too.

55:09.660 --> 55:12.140
I mean they can get out of all that left-sidedness.

55:12.140 --> 55:20.370
In India also we have big communities in the
south where people have lived with too much

55:20.370 --> 55:26.979
ritualism and all that and have taken to left-sided
behaviour of attracting you know spirits and

55:26.979 --> 55:29.459
this and that, and giving those [telesmart?]
and all that.

55:29.459 --> 55:34.739
They have done all that they are doing, like
witchcraft, witch doctors and all that.

55:34.739 --> 55:39.650
They must be doing it, but it can be cured
there’s no problem.

55:39.650 --> 55:45.430
As the west, people are over developed and
very ego orientated and right side.

55:45.430 --> 55:48.909
Both are extreme cases, but you can be correct.

55:48.909 --> 55:54.569
The people who are left side it’s easier
because they have to move forward but it’s

55:54.569 --> 55:57.150
difficult for ego orientated to move backwards.

55:57.150 --> 56:01.019
But if we can do that there why not here,
so nothing is lost.

56:01.019 --> 56:04.900
One should not worry too much about these
things.

56:04.900 --> 56:09.319
Human begins are just the same everybody has
Kundalini, finished.

56:09.319 --> 56:19.419
As long as you have Kundalini I have no problem.

56:19.419 --> 56:23.759
Question: Is there anything wrong with eating
chilies?

56:23.759 --> 56:27.519
Shri Mataji: No, it suits some people very
much.

56:27.519 --> 56:32.130
Some people should have, those who suffer
from colds will be a good idea, suffer from

56:32.130 --> 56:34.019
constipation is a good idea.

56:34.019 --> 56:36.150
But don’t eat too much of anything.

56:36.150 --> 56:41.309
But it’s good for some people, something
is good for some people, something is good

56:41.309 --> 56:42.989
for some people, you have to just find out.

56:42.989 --> 56:47.439
For people who get constipated it is better
to have a little of green chilies all the

56:47.439 --> 56:50.490
time, it is very rich in vitamin C.

56:50.490 --> 57:01.340
It is very rich in vitamin C is good for people
who catch colds very easily.

57:01.340 --> 57:07.989
Question: Do you know anything about the teaching
called Mahikari

57:07.989 --> 57:10.929
Shri Mataji: I know.

57:10.929 --> 57:20.600
You see Mahikari thing was, the person who
started Mahikari was a realised soul, though

57:20.600 --> 57:22.420
not so well equipped.

57:22.420 --> 57:30.419
I’ve met him before his realisation and
he got realisation I think through Me only,

57:30.419 --> 57:31.469
what ever it was.

57:31.469 --> 57:34.329
I do not want to claim anything like that.

57:34.329 --> 57:36.410
But only thing is he was not equipped, well
equipped.

57:36.410 --> 57:39.539
Like anybody here who gets realisation starts
doing something.

57:39.539 --> 57:44.019
And his daughter I think, mislead the people
because she’s not a realised soul.

57:44.019 --> 57:49.239
She became very money-orientated, she started
putting it, it’s happened with every one

57:49.239 --> 57:50.239
of them.

57:50.239 --> 57:56.100
But poor thing, this one was not, he just
got realisation he was not an incarnation

57:56.100 --> 57:58.100
also, you see.

57:58.100 --> 58:06.789
Even incarnations who came on this earth like
Christ you see, like Mohammad Sahab, like

58:06.789 --> 58:12.149
Rama, Krishna see such great incarnations
were purest of pure.

58:12.149 --> 58:18.959
Even those people have been mishandled and
people have raised organisations, which are

58:18.959 --> 58:21.409
just money making propositions.

58:21.409 --> 58:23.069
Everything some how man makes into money.

58:23.069 --> 58:28.149
I don’t know how, it’s something that
happens to human beings you see.

58:28.149 --> 58:33.559
Then they start giving [Telesmart?] then they
start giving this, that, cross, this I mean

58:33.559 --> 58:35.739
it’s a money-making proposition through
out.

58:35.739 --> 58:39.769
You see this is the trouble.

58:39.769 --> 58:44.930
Warren: She said you are right.

58:44.930 --> 58:52.709
Shri Mataji: And you may lose lots of your
powers, even ordinary, normal powers with

58:52.709 --> 59:02.239
this kind of a wrong attitude you see, or
misguidance, because it happens like that,

59:02.239 --> 59:04.840
you can make mistakes, you can do so many
things.

59:04.840 --> 59:12.590
You know I’ve seen people, one girl whom
I had given realisation she went to a lady

59:12.590 --> 59:13.979
who was a medium.

59:13.979 --> 59:17.229
She used to get “Ho, ho, ho, ho,” like
that, and this thing.

59:17.229 --> 59:18.229
And she

59:18.229 --> 59:21.709
gave her a talisman and she became actually
blind, actually blind.

59:21.709 --> 59:27.900
Now she’s blind, her eyes are open, I mean
I have to still cure her.

59:27.900 --> 59:31.649
This is the report I got about her.

59:31.649 --> 59:35.968
Question: Would you say the same of the Hari
Krishna Organisation?

59:35.968 --> 59:37.799
Shri Mataji: Oh, now you are pulling Me into
controversy.

59:37.799 --> 59:42.049
But I will tell you the other way round.

59:42.049 --> 59:47.959
You see if you go on calling say the name
of anybody, even your name would you like

59:47.959 --> 59:48.959
it?

59:48.959 --> 59:51.329
So then how can God like it?

59:51.329 --> 59:59.249
On the Oxford Street you stand up, you should
see the site, they even sell those things

59:59.249 --> 01:00:03.979
see like wigs, they sell them like wigs in
the market.

01:00:03.979 --> 01:00:07.949
They shave off and sometimes they wear wigs.

01:00:07.949 --> 01:00:13.380
See it’s not show, it is something that
has to happen within.

01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:18.809
It’s not the show that you put up is something
that has to happen.

01:00:18.809 --> 01:00:25.689
You see most of them end up with throat cancer
and very violent, very violent people.

01:00:25.689 --> 01:00:30.120
They are beggars’ absolute parasites.

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:33.539
Warren: with expensive cars.

01:00:33.539 --> 01:00:40.209
Shri Mataji: You see this is very nice,
I met somebody in England and I told him,

01:00:40.209 --> 01:00:42.679
“What do you do here?” He said, “I deal
in opium."

01:00:42.679 --> 01:00:46.990
I got a fright.
I said, “Opium, how do you deal in opium?”

01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:50.579
“Other people’s money,”
I said, “That’s very good, other people’s

01:00:50.579 --> 01:00:51.579
money."

01:00:51.579 --> 01:00:52.729
You see you can float an enterprise.

01:00:52.729 --> 01:00:59.799
It’s very easy because you are such seekers
such great seekers of ages and you are so

01:00:59.799 --> 01:01:01.489
naïve, very good.

01:01:01.489 --> 01:01:09.029
You go anywhere they’ll take a square, sit
there with saffron cloths with some circles

01:01:09.029 --> 01:01:11.149
on, another fellow will be fanning.

01:01:11.149 --> 01:01:15.929
Oh this one is very great, coming direct from
Kashi.

01:01:15.929 --> 01:01:18.019
Then have nothing to do with horrible people.

01:01:18.019 --> 01:01:22.819
Kashi is one of the worst places now.

01:01:22.819 --> 01:01:27.209
So you all go and prostrate.

01:01:27.209 --> 01:01:28.529
This is what it is.

01:01:28.529 --> 01:01:33.860
I mean, why are you enamoured by these circuses,
aren’t you fed up with them?

01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:39.860
We had a lady from Norway, this one was very
interesting.

01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:44.400
She came to My house stayed with Me, very
badly caught up, and she told Me the story

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.999
of a lama who came to Norway.

01:01:45.999 --> 01:01:50.850
First he told all these Norwegians, “You
see, if I have to come to Norway you have

01:01:50.850 --> 01:01:54.669
to make a place with the floor which has got
all marble."

01:01:54.669 --> 01:01:55.829
Look at that.

01:01:55.829 --> 01:01:58.159
They’re such parasites these Lamas are.

01:01:58.159 --> 01:02:03.600
First they have sucked the blood of these
poor Tibetans and now they were willing to

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:04.880
suck the blood of these Norwegians.

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:09.850
Now these poor young people you see, I should
say the young people in the west are really

01:02:09.850 --> 01:02:14.919
not rich because they’re parents do not
give them money the way we give our children

01:02:14.919 --> 01:02:15.919
you see.

01:02:15.919 --> 01:02:21.890
So they starve themselves, they ate only potatoes
and this and that and for one year they starved

01:02:21.890 --> 01:02:26.489
themselves to create this floor for these
horrible people.

01:02:26.489 --> 01:02:29.850
And this fellow came you see, with his shaved
head and all that.

01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:38.029
He stayed there and this lady told Me that
she had to go and just bow to him one thousand

01:02:38.029 --> 01:02:39.590
times for three months.

01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:40.749
One thousand times.

01:02:40.749 --> 01:02:46.319
Imagine, just to go, as it is he’ll be finished,
even three times is sufficient to finish you

01:02:46.319 --> 01:02:47.969
off.

01:02:47.969 --> 01:02:49.809
And three months she did it.

01:02:49.809 --> 01:02:54.130
And with Me she was arguing morning till evening.

01:02:54.130 --> 01:02:59.479
I said, “Look at that, her arguing with
Me, eating My head off and here your bowing

01:02:59.479 --> 01:03:00.479
to him."

01:03:00.479 --> 01:03:04.880
They would not allow anybody to go near the
lama, the great was sitting on the seventh

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:08.009
step somewhere hanging in the air.

01:03:08.009 --> 01:03:17.319
Is very common you know, the more you are
missing from the scene the more you are difficult

01:03:17.319 --> 01:03:19.179
to be seen you see.

01:03:19.179 --> 01:03:22.340
Is something great, “Oh, ho! I’ve seen
the glimpse of that

01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:25.329
horrible thing,” that’s what people think.

01:03:25.329 --> 01:03:30.890
You see this is what they play upon you emotional,
what you call it emotional blackmail.

01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:34.049
That’s what it is.

01:03:34.049 --> 01:03:37.870
They will tell you first of all they’re,
we call them chumchars, we call them spoons.

01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:40.579
They’ll come and tell you, “Oh this is
very difficult, you know.

01:03:40.579 --> 01:03:49.829
He may not give you any interview, and you
have to at least you should shell out five

01:03:49.829 --> 01:03:54.739
hundred rupees, see it is not easy, it’s
very difficult.

01:03:54.739 --> 01:04:01.739
Only you should send your photograph with
five hundred,” all this nonsense.

01:04:01.739 --> 01:04:08.140
If you are the river Ganges, what can malign
you, what can dirty you, what can make you

01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:09.259
impure?

01:04:09.259 --> 01:04:13.630
If you are here for purification then nothing
can impure you.

01:04:13.630 --> 01:04:21.659
One two three four, now the one who has not
asked at all should ask

01:04:21.659 --> 01:04:23.889
Question: Over the years it seems we have
lost our power to believe in our self that

01:04:23.889 --> 01:04:50.210
we had in Egyptian times the power to believe
in ourselves but we went wrong..

01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:58.739
Warren: the question is the loss of power
within ourselves, perhaps back in the days

01:04:58.739 --> 01:05:05.370
of Egypt we had these powers, we seem to have
lost our power to believe in ourself.

01:05:05.370 --> 01:05:10.960
Shri Mataji: I don’t know even if at that
time you had those powers very much.

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:17.069
But Egyptians indulged more on the ego side
you see, those who were rulers.

01:05:17.069 --> 01:05:22.600
And the slaves were on the left hand side
too much because they obeyed the rulers you

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:23.600
see.

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:27.870
So the sensitivity came to them from spirits,
not directly from themselves.

01:05:27.870 --> 01:05:34.469
And some of them were really, very realised
souls and you’ll be amazed if these extreme

01:05:34.469 --> 01:05:38.590
cases are there they understand an incarnation
better.

01:05:38.590 --> 01:05:46.209
Say if you are taking LSD too much, you will
see only lights coming out of Me, you won’t

01:05:46.209 --> 01:05:47.209
see Me.

01:05:47.209 --> 01:05:51.769
There are many who must have seen that, auras
and things, if you are on the right hand side

01:05:51.769 --> 01:05:52.860
too much.

01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:57.269
If you are on the left had side you’ll be
awed, you’ll be shaking before Me and you

01:05:57.269 --> 01:06:02.090
may see My previous births and you’ll be
quite frightened because you’ll know what

01:06:02.090 --> 01:06:03.090
it is.

01:06:03.090 --> 01:06:09.549
So they understood the incarnations better,
but evolutionary you are much higher than

01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:10.829
they are.

01:06:10.829 --> 01:06:18.959
Though there’s confusion because of so called
freedom you had which you misused.

01:06:18.959 --> 01:06:25.459
But as a whole I think this is the time for
blossom.

01:06:25.459 --> 01:06:32.350
Only thing you must know that you’re a seeker
and you are a seeker then you must get it

01:06:32.350 --> 01:06:36.739
and if you get it why should you be surprised.

01:06:36.739 --> 01:06:41.860
But it’s like a seeking has become like
a fashion, seeking here, seeking there seeking

01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:43.689
there, seeking you stop no where you see.

01:06:43.689 --> 01:06:48.289
You see you go on fixing the bolts you see,
you’re just going with an inertia, even

01:06:48.289 --> 01:06:50.759
if you stop fixing you still go on like that.

01:06:50.759 --> 01:06:56.529
It’s like that, you see, it’s a style
you have developed going from this to that,

01:06:56.529 --> 01:07:01.519
that to that, that to that and you cannot
stop it.

01:07:01.519 --> 01:07:22.390
Question: I’d be interested in Your opinion
of philosophy for Rudolf Steiner and secondly

01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:33.289
you concept of Papa tax sungar in India.

01:07:33.289 --> 01:07:39.130
All these are all people playing on bhoots
and things, that’s all I can say.

01:07:39.130 --> 01:07:47.319
(Shri Mother asks the seeker what does Steiner
say and he says million words.)

01:07:47.319 --> 01:07:55.100
Word, words, words and words, what does he
say?

01:07:55.100 --> 01:08:09.579
This Steiner his vibrations are very good,
Might be a realised soul but what does he

01:08:09.579 --> 01:08:11.559
say?

01:08:11.559 --> 01:08:31.350
Seekers tries to tell Shri Mataji what he
writes about.

01:08:31.350 --> 01:08:38.860
He might be a realised soul like Khalil Gibran
is, you see his vibrations are good.

01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:43.130
He might be, but still you have to become
realised souls you see.

01:08:43.130 --> 01:08:45.559
Reading that even Zen is all that.

01:08:45.559 --> 01:08:49.009
Zen is everything is, nothing but his realisation.

01:08:49.009 --> 01:08:54.759
But you’ll be amazed that the head of Zen
himself reads all Zen without being realised,

01:08:54.759 --> 01:08:57.169
and he’s a hopeless fellow.

01:08:57.169 --> 01:08:59.699
I just talked to him and he said, “Oh, he
cannot get realisation."

01:08:59.699 --> 01:09:00.730
He’s confirmed on that point.

01:09:00.730 --> 01:09:06.700
Imagine the head of the Zen saying that, and
he said we had kashapas only twenty six kashapas

01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:09.960
we had in six centuries can you believe it.

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:14.120
And he wouldn’t take his realisation and
he was so frightened.

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:17.399
He accepted Me all right but he said, “I
am nowhere, Mother, compared to You."

01:09:17.399 --> 01:09:18.399
“What is this?

01:09:18.399 --> 01:09:19.949
But I am telling you can get."

01:09:19.949 --> 01:09:21.630
Warren: Steiner catches on Agnya and swadisthan.

01:09:21.630 --> 01:09:26.299
Shri Mataji: So it’s good to read somebody
who is a realised soul, but you better get

01:09:26.299 --> 01:09:27.299
it yourself.

01:09:27.299 --> 01:09:30.850
You become Steiner, all right.

01:09:30.850 --> 01:09:35.779
What I’m saying, you become a realised soul.

01:09:35.779 --> 01:09:41.249
And you can write about your own experiences.

01:09:41.249 --> 01:09:44.360
Yes, please.

01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:53.219
Question: Seeker asks about opinion of Dadaji.

01:09:53.219 --> 01:09:56.120
Shri Mataji: Dadaji, he’s arrested.

01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:57.870
Warren: In Calcutta

01:09:57.870 --> 01:10:01.360
Shri Mataji: He’s already in jail.

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:06.620
No, he was in Pune where he was arrested,
this Dadaji.

01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:10.480
This happened about I think, I don’t know,
but I heard about it.

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:13.360
I don’t know when it happened.

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:18.700
No it was not because of any political thing.

01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:24.470
But they found some income tax things and
all that and lots of, I don’t know, I didn’t

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:28.260
pay much attention but he’s arrested that
I know.

01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:38.680
There are these sorts of things but the best
part of the thing is that all that is untruth

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:41.110
is exposed, gradually.

01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:45.400
Whatever things they may put out, whatever
story they may put out, whatever they may

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:49.830
try, they may entice you, you may be interested
in them whatever it is.

01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:52.950
But they themselves meet their end.

01:10:52.950 --> 01:11:00.710
Because all that is falsehood has an end and
truth is endless, it is anand, it is eternal.

01:11:00.710 --> 01:11:04.310
The truth is eternal.

01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:10.060
Question: What do you see as the future of
the United Nations?

01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:12.509
Shri Mataji: That’s a tricky question.

01:11:12.509 --> 01:11:15.400
My husband is one of the secretary generals.

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:18.410
I better not speak all right.

01:11:18.410 --> 01:11:20.110
Let it be.

01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:26.610
We’ll see about it, work it out.

01:11:26.610 --> 01:11:28.770
Some tricks we have to play.

01:11:28.770 --> 01:11:31.970
Question: Do you know of Krishnamurti?

01:11:31.970 --> 01:11:39.190
Shri Mataji: Oh, very much, he’s another
one.

01:11:39.190 --> 01:11:41.450
Krishnamurti is another blah, blah, blah.

01:11:41.450 --> 01:11:44.860
I’ll tell you about Krishnamurti very well.

01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:47.540
You see what Krishnamurti does?

01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:52.860
He says this part what I say that “There
are false gurus."

01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:56.190
But I don’t say there are not real ones.

01:11:56.190 --> 01:11:59.770
If there is falsehood, if there’s artificiality,
there has to be real.

01:11:59.770 --> 01:12:04.030
If there are artificial flowers there has
to be a real flower, too.

01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:09.211
So he negates you from the other side completely
and he puts up your ego by saying, “Oh you

01:12:09.211 --> 01:12:10.300
can find it,” so you are finished.

01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:14.610
He’s a blind leading others into blindness.

01:12:14.610 --> 01:12:25.570
(Delete-Yogi relates story of a seeker about
his meeting with Krishnamurti to Shri Mataji.

01:12:25.570 --> 01:12:35.580
He saw him personally asks him “why do you
do what you do” and Krishnamurti said, “Does

01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:37.280
a rose ask why?”)

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:43.320
Shri Mataji: I mean it has no awareness, simple
answer is as that.

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:45.880
A rose has no awareness.

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:49.470
By any chance he’s not a rose.

01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:52.550
he’s just thorns that’s what I know.

01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:54.881
Those who have come from him have had a very
bad time I must tell you.

01:12:54.881 --> 01:12:58.770
You see they are really so depressed and so
horrid.

01:12:58.770 --> 01:13:02.159
We had one architect; I mean his life was
finished.

01:13:02.159 --> 01:13:07.780
So many of them I’ve met, horrible they’re
very argumentative.

01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:12.550
The best example I’ll give you about this
because you’ve brought forth.

01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:25.760
There was a fellow who came to see Me, he’s
the grandson of his guru.

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:34.640
His guru was Yogananda, Yogananda, the Kriya
yogis, you see.

01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:44.620
He was the grandson of the Dadaji or something,
Babaji, called Dadaji then Babaji

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:46.280
are there.

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:54.430
This Babaji, his grandson, you see, his Yogananda’s
guru was somebody else, and he was the son

01:13:54.430 --> 01:14:00.850
of this fellow, but I mean the grandson of
his guru, so the great grandson of Babaji.

01:14:00.850 --> 01:14:07.470
So the whole family was Kriya and he did all
the Kriya Yoga and everything he did.

01:14:07.470 --> 01:14:10.640
He went there and he got so frightened.

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:17.240
One day he happened to see this Krishnamurti
that there should be no he said, “No Kriya

01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:22.310
and all that, you see, that you are your own
guru,” and this and that."

01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:26.450
So he said, “Oh God, what have I been doing?”
So he gave up Kriya Yoga and came to Mr.

01:14:26.450 --> 01:14:30.170
Krishnamurti.
He said, “I became such an expert that I

01:14:30.170 --> 01:14:31.820
spoke better than Krishnamurti did."

01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:35.750
And everybody was surprised and said, “Second
Krishnamurti is coming and I ran away for

01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:36.750
there.

01:14:36.750 --> 01:14:40.750
I said, “Now this is that thing is happening
to Me.

01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:44.920
And he came to Me, you’ll be amazed I’ve
not been able to give him realisation till

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:45.920
today.

01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:48.430
I must tell you this, he comes to Me still
often.

01:14:48.430 --> 01:14:50.080
Often, very often he comes to Me.

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:52.060
I’ve not yet given him realisation.

01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:56.660
Imagine the grandson of this Babaji has to
bear I don’t know what things, poor things

01:14:56.660 --> 01:15:02.240
has been done to him, I ‘m very sorry for
him.

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:05.680
Question: Do you know Rajneesh?

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:09.800
Shri Mataji: He’s another horrible one.

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:17.440
Why do you need a guru for such a thing?

01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:20.590
You are masters, he’s a fool, he doesn’t
know compared to what you know.

01:15:20.590 --> 01:15:26.690
But you see what you thought of, that inside
you are human beings, you feel guilty that

01:15:26.690 --> 01:15:29.730
you talk of sex with animals, sex with this,
this, that.

01:15:29.730 --> 01:15:34.750
If there’s something lurking in you, there’s
something wrong in all this perversion and

01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:36.400
homosexuality this that and all that.

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:40.780
So you thought it better to have a guru at
least he’ll certify.

01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:45.440
But he is going to make you take two running
jumps to go to hell, I tell you.

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:51.190
And he talks, just there and he talks, “That
you’ll go to bottomless pit,” in the bible

01:15:51.190 --> 01:15:52.700
a bottomless pit is the hell.

01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:56.150
You see he’s very honest in a way, he says
so.

01:15:56.150 --> 01:15:59.440
He said, “You’ll go to bottomless pit."

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:04.220
He has criticised Christ to such an extent
that he said that Christ had bad relations

01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:05.660
with his own Mother.

01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:11.080
Oh to that extent, he said about Mohammad
having bad relation with his daughter.

01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:15.860
All sorts of things he is talking and you
know people publish it.

01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:17.700
He’s getting such a publicity.

01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:24.070
He pays money to people that they write against
Me and doing all kinds of things.

01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:29.510
Indians don’t like him at all, at all, they
hate him, they want him to get out but he’s

01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:32.250
so localised he cannot smell a flower and
he calls himself Bhagavan, means God.

01:16:32.250 --> 01:16:41.550
In the book you see, anywhere you read, any
Indian book where they have described God,

01:16:41.550 --> 01:16:47.150
the names of God, they’re thousand names
supposing, of Vishnu or of the Goddess, anything.

01:16:47.150 --> 01:16:51.330
At least fifteen or twenty of them are that
they are fond of flowers, they’re fond of

01:16:51.330 --> 01:16:52.690
fragrance, they’re fragrant.

01:16:52.690 --> 01:16:58.120
That they’re fond of Kamalas, Champas they’re
fond this that all is there and this fellow

01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:03.110
cannot see, if you show a flower to him he’ll
run away.

01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:09.550
He cannot bear to have any incense being burnt
anywhere.

01:17:09.550 --> 01:17:13.720
When you go there you they see and you can
only put phenyl to go and see him.

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:16.650
I think he’s a bathroom cleaner, that’s
what he is.

01:17:16.650 --> 01:17:18.680
The way he’s so much afraid.

01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:24.610
I don’t know what he likes the bathroom
smell.

01:17:24.610 --> 01:17:29.030
And he does all dirty things, very dirty fellow,
is filthy I don’t want to tell you what

01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:34.860
he does but I know what he does.

01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:45.650
Question: Could you explain the meaning of
satoori and samadhi.

01:17:45.650 --> 01:17:49.700
Shri Mataji:That’s Zen.

01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:58.060
You see Zen satoori is the same as samadhi
but it’s a, you see the Zen were as I told

01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:04.420
you in six centuries were twenty-six and whatever
they wrote people never understood you see.

01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:09.370
Because they were realised souls, some of
them were born realised, some got realisation.

01:18:09.370 --> 01:18:14.090
Now even when you will talk people won’t
understand you, it’s a very surprise thing.

01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:16.960
But it happens like that because your language
changes.

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:20.900
Now they call it satoori is a samadhi but

01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:28.400
it’s not so clearly given, they could not
explain so clearly about it not properly to

01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:31.670
people, it’s not so clear cut.

01:18:31.670 --> 01:18:37.820
Now in our Sahaja Yoga we have first of all
Nirvichara samadhi.

01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:42.260
Samadhi, dhi means awareness, and samadhi
means enlightened awareness.

01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:43.930
Nirvichara means thoughtless.

01:18:43.930 --> 01:18:48.180
Thoughtless enlightened awareness is first
thing, is clear.

01:18:48.180 --> 01:18:52.900
Sahaja Yoga is very clear cut practical, every
word of it.

01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:56.270
You see it so clearly there’s no vagueness
about it.

01:18:56.270 --> 01:19:00.620
Even you’ll understand Bible better, Zen
better, everything better if you know Sahaja

01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:04.170
Yoga because your eyes are open to it, all
right.

01:19:04.170 --> 01:19:07.800
So the first thing is Nirvichara Samadhi.

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:16.510
With Nirvichara Samadhi when it crosses your
Agnya chakra you get Nirvichara, means when

01:19:16.510 --> 01:19:18.170
your ego is pulled down.

01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:19.740
With that you get powers.

01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:23.150
Like you see if you become a deputy governor
you get powers if you become a governor you

01:19:23.150 --> 01:19:24.150
get powers.

01:19:24.150 --> 01:19:27.460
The first powers you get is curative powers.

01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:30.980
You get cured and you can cure others.

01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:35.470
Many people whom I have cured are not Sahaja
yogis they’re useless people actually.

01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:39.610
I’ve given up curing people for the same
reason because they just come for cures they

01:19:39.610 --> 01:19:40.610
get cured and lost.

01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:43.700
What’s the use of curing people who are
not going to give the light?

01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:47.930
You see you don’t repair lights which are
not going to work out.

01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:51.990
It’s a horrible stuff you see, curing people,
but you do cure.

01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:57.250
You start curing people automatically with
raising [sounds like das?] not with spirit.

01:19:57.250 --> 01:20:01.380
There are another faith healers and all that
nonsense is not there.

01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:06.480
Also Kundalini can rise to a point with a
person like that.

01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:09.560
But one should not stay at that point must
go higher.

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:15.920
Because the movement on right and left you
start getting either supra conscious or your

01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:22.920
subconscious experiences which can be very
alluring and you can be quite lost in them.

01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:29.720
You start seeing lights, you start seeing
something different, you might see an aura

01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:30.720
around Me.

01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:36.150
I mean you see lots of things, you may see
something else in My past , that should not

01:20:36.150 --> 01:20:37.150
be there.

01:20:37.150 --> 01:20:38.150
You should forget about it.

01:20:38.150 --> 01:20:42.500
You have to go to the airport to catch the
plane isn’t it, so don’t see all the things

01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:45.130
around, it’s all not wanted.

01:20:45.130 --> 01:20:50.840
Many people get lost at that point when they
stop at Agnya, if you have concentrated here

01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:55.240
this can happen more because this is broken
or if you have had this third eye business

01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:57.480
and all that you may go to the side.

01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:59.320
It can be quite dangerous.

01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:08.650
You see if you use these your samadhi for
some sort of a sensation.

01:21:08.650 --> 01:21:10.420
So you should not.

01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:18.730
I mean all wise people should not use this
movement at all, as far as possible say, “No

01:21:18.730 --> 01:21:19.750
we don’t want to see that.

01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:23.160
We don’t want to have any supra conscious
sensation,” and all that.

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:31.900
Then you rise higher and then you try to feel
your silence in the limbic area and you have

01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:34.180
to feel your vibrations coming out from your
head.

01:21:34.180 --> 01:21:40.340
It is the vibrations when they are flowing
that’s the best stage, when you have pierced

01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:41.840
through your Bramarundra.

01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:46.720
So the second stage starts from Nirvikalpa
Samadhi growing into, which many of the Sahaja

01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:54.960
Yogis have achieved in Australia, is called
as Nirvikalpa, where the is no doubts.

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:58.270
You have no doubts left about Sahaja Yoga,
you have no doubts left about yourself.

01:21:58.270 --> 01:22:03.760
It’s a state, it’s not that by mentally
or rationally but it’s a state.

01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:08.430
Where you see it so clearly, white is white,
you don’t have to doubt that whether my

01:22:08.430 --> 01:22:10.890
eyes are showing white or black, you see.

01:22:10.890 --> 01:22:15.850
That state is reached is called as Nirvikalpa
where the no vikalpa, you just go, move steadily

01:22:15.850 --> 01:22:20.680
and that’s the best stage where you really
grow faster because you’re so steady and

01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:22.290
that stage must be achieved.

01:22:22.290 --> 01:22:26.860
So try to achieve that stage through negating
things, “Nethi, nethi, vachinay nigamoor,”

01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:34.840
by saying, “Not this, not this, not this,”
and you reach that stage, is very clearly

01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:35.840
given.

01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:43.150
You see the trouble is, so many of these books
which are so great are never translated, people

01:22:43.150 --> 01:22:44.150
do not know about them.

01:22:44.150 --> 01:22:49.480
Now after coming to Sahaja Yoga you will be
exposed to them and you will see what truths

01:22:49.480 --> 01:23:02.340
there are and how Sahaja Yoga verifies it
and proves it.

01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:06.710
Question: What influence are you likely to
have on those around him or on people who

01:23:06.710 --> 01:23:09.750
live with You who are not realised.

01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:17.000
What is the realised souls influence in that
type of environment?

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:26.040
Shri Mataji:You see if you have stones and
if you have living trees, stones do not receive

01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:32.050
anything from the sun but the leaves receive
something isn’t it, they are more sensitive,

01:23:32.050 --> 01:23:33.400
that’s the difference.

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:39.000
Then in Sahaja yoga there’s a possibility
that you can convert stones into living beings,

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.840
can be done.

01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:50.760
Yes, because they see, you see they see you,
they understand the value that you are, gradually,

01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:56.540
rationally they start understanding then they
reach certain conclusions, then they come

01:23:56.540 --> 01:24:00.750
to Sahaja Yog, then they get realised, it
works out that way.

01:24:00.750 --> 01:24:04.660
But with seekers it’s very different, seekers
just jump into it.

01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:07.190
They do not think about it they just get it.

01:24:07.190 --> 01:24:11.770
They get it so fast that they don’t think
about it, they just they get it.

01:24:11.770 --> 01:24:19.350
So they are so sensitive that’s the difference.

01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:29.760
Question: Can we help our loved ones who do
not want to listen to anything particularly

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:31.430
about Sahaja Yoga?

01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:37.170
Shri Mataji: You see there’s nobody else
that you help someone, they are all within

01:24:37.170 --> 01:24:38.170
yourself.

01:24:38.170 --> 01:24:43.020
On the contrary, I would say better to have
them together who are Sahaja yogis because

01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:47.120
those who are not will trouble you, it will
be a problem, leave them alone, they’ll

01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:48.750
be all right, they’ll come round.

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:53.860
Let them come on their own you cannot force
them, they’re loved ones, you’ll change

01:24:53.860 --> 01:24:59.150
now your priorities, you’ll understand that
those who are really loved ones are not really

01:24:59.150 --> 01:25:01.310
your brothers and sisters.

01:25:01.310 --> 01:25:08.710
As Christ has said, “Who are my brothers
and sisters?” Now we have to ask that question.

01:25:08.710 --> 01:25:12.590
Because you speak another language, you are
a different person, not that you give them

01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:14.570
up, but they exist.

01:25:14.570 --> 01:25:18.080
But they haven’t got your awareness so is
a different thing all together.

01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:24.050
But you help them in a way, gradually they
see you but if you force them they’ll run

01:25:24.050 --> 01:25:25.050
away.

01:25:25.050 --> 01:25:29.180
No use forcing or telling them anything about
it but you show your satisfaction and happiness

01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:34.850
and your growth and others get impressed by
it and they just come to you.

01:25:34.850 --> 01:25:40.180
Question: how can you..Do You help them?

01:25:40.180 --> 01:25:42.960
Shri Mataji: Yes, I do.

01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:46.500
But you should put them out of your minds
and say, “Mother, You help.

01:25:46.500 --> 01:26:00.770
If You try to help, then I’ll leave it to
You."

01:26:00.770 --> 01:26:06.230
Question: He cannot understand why You say
that Christ died for us.

01:26:06.230 --> 01:26:08.530
Why did He die for us?

01:26:08.530 --> 01:26:14.350
Shri Mataji: What else could He have done
with the stupid people?

01:26:14.350 --> 01:26:17.420
They crucified Him, He didn’t say, “You
come and crucify Me,” did He, you see?

01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:20.280
They’re stupid, horrible people, donkeys.

01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:26.330
They didn’t understand Him, stones as they
were what to do?

01:26:26.330 --> 01:26:29.440
They crucified Him, He didn’t ask.

01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:37.790
But when He was crucified the sins that they
committed in crucifying Him were to be forgiven.

01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:40.610
That’s what it is.

01:26:40.610 --> 01:26:43.090
He was, what did He do?

01:26:43.090 --> 01:26:47.500
You see He died because of you because people
like you only crucified Him.

01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:48.620
You represent them.

01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:54.210
When you are realised then you are different
people, then you are resurrected.

01:26:54.210 --> 01:26:59.810
His message was resurrection not crucifixion
but that shows the stupidity of these people,

01:26:59.810 --> 01:27:00.810
isn’t it.

01:27:00.810 --> 01:27:21.480
I mean you may do that again I can’t say,
there are people.

01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:42.550
Question: Is it possible to exercise love
and acceptance when as she says You’re judging

01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:46.020
people as to whether they’re right or wrong.

01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:49.730
Warren: We are using vibrations

01:27:49.730 --> 01:27:58.210
Shri Mataji: I am not judging, you are judging
because when you get your vibrations you start

01:27:58.210 --> 01:27:59.710
judging yourself.

01:27:59.710 --> 01:28:06.290
You see I am not judging it’s only your
own judgment.

01:28:06.290 --> 01:28:07.380
It’s your own judgment.

01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:11.800
Are you getting your cool breeze in the hands?

01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:14.250
No, then let it happen.

01:28:14.250 --> 01:28:19.170
I’m not judging you it’s you are judging
it yourself.

01:28:19.170 --> 01:28:20.670
All right, then you will know yourself.

01:28:20.670 --> 01:28:26.850
Just now you are judging that you’re not
getting vibrations.

01:28:26.850 --> 01:28:41.590
Question: Is it true that Indira Gandi is
worshiped as a Goddess?

01:28:41.590 --> 01:29:02.450
Shri Mataji: oh don't, That's all political
stuff, you see Indian people are like that.

01:29:02.450 --> 01:29:14.860
Warren: that's useless

01:29:14.860 --> 01:29:30.300
Question: She’s confused about the fact
that You talked about love and acceptance

01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:36.090
at the beginning but then when peoples names
were brought up we often scoffed at them.

01:29:36.090 --> 01:29:38.820
Shri Mataji: ah About the gurus?

01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:40.270
Ah, that’s it.

01:29:40.270 --> 01:29:42.680
It’s a very important point.

01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:48.760
That’s very much with you people.

01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:53.990
You see you have all of you, you see have
developed a philosophy where you say that

01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:57.550
nobody is evil, everything is fine.

01:29:57.550 --> 01:30:02.780
This is a very good philosophy to work with
because you also fit into the thing.

01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:04.800
That nothing is evil about you also, isn’t
it?

01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:06.310
It happens like that.

01:30:06.310 --> 01:30:12.930
You remember when Christ was criticising these
horrible people they asked Him, “How do

01:30:12.930 --> 01:30:14.610
You criticise them?

01:30:14.610 --> 01:30:17.110
They do not criticise You."

01:30:17.110 --> 01:30:25.380
Then He said, “Will the devil talk against
its own house?”

01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:34.430
There is a negative force working, very much
active and you have to not only scoff but

01:30:34.430 --> 01:30:42.410
get rid of these things because they are acting
as your destroying forces and they destroy

01:30:42.410 --> 01:30:45.660
you, I see them very clearly and I have to
tell you.

01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:52.210
So love doesn’t mean that I love a snake,
will you go and love a snake, a snake must

01:30:52.210 --> 01:30:56.639
understand first of all.

01:30:56.639 --> 01:31:00.710
In the same way we have to understand there
are evil people, that’s true.

01:31:00.710 --> 01:31:06.290
That is what is very much in the West, I see,
“Oh, you love everyone is all right.

01:31:06.290 --> 01:31:08.910
But you don’t love a snake, do you?

01:31:08.910 --> 01:31:11.560
Go and have, ask snake, “I want to love
you."

01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:20.310
He’ll just finish you off.

01:31:20.310 --> 01:31:24.940
So many of you are harmed so much by these
people and I have to cure you.

01:31:24.940 --> 01:31:30.610
You don’t know what I have to go through,
such a lot of work to cure you when you are

01:31:30.610 --> 01:31:31.710
affected by these people.

01:31:31.710 --> 01:31:35.470
You don’t know how much I’ve worked, morning
till evening.

01:31:35.470 --> 01:31:42.210
This morning I started six o’clock till
I came here just ten minutes I got to change

01:31:42.210 --> 01:31:44.410
My sari and I was here.

01:31:44.410 --> 01:31:48.810
These are affected by other gurus and things
and I have to take it out.

01:31:48.810 --> 01:31:50.330
I know what harm they have done to you.

01:31:50.330 --> 01:31:56.320
You have no idea.

01:31:56.320 --> 01:32:05.260
Question: What are Your objections to chanting
and singing the holy scriptures?

01:32:05.260 --> 01:32:13.930
Shri Mataji: Not at all, who told you I am,
I’m not but you must understand that without

01:32:13.930 --> 01:32:18.240
understanding what chanting is needed it’s
like a medicine.

01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:20.720
Chanting is a mantra.

01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:32.760
Mantra means a thing that acts as a sound
to correct a particular thing within you,

01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:33.800
all right.

01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:37.430
It’s you can say sound therapy it is, all
right.

01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:43.470
Now you have to know what medicine is needed
for which charka, also you must know where

01:32:43.470 --> 01:32:47.920
is the problem with you, or with anybody else.

01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:53.590
I mean it would be chanting at random means
sometimes it would be sort of an indiscriminate

01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:56.360
drinking of all the medicines, you see.

01:32:56.360 --> 01:33:00.590
Taking all the medicines bottles into your
stomach emptying them without understanding.

01:33:00.590 --> 01:33:05.500
We do chant but we know where to chant, what.

01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:07.960
You see, not indiscriminate, just like that.

01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:13.560
And it’s very dangerous because when you
go on chanting say, Rama’s name or Krishna’s

01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:14.560
name.

01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:18.610
Now when you say Krishna’s name, Krishna
is here, if your Kundalini has not reached

01:33:18.610 --> 01:33:24.430
there up to this point if you take Krishna’s
name it’s very, very annoying for Krishna

01:33:24.430 --> 01:33:27.180
Himself and He recedes, sleeps off.

01:33:27.180 --> 01:33:33.470
He freezes sometimes and by that you develop
problems of the chakras and sometimes you

01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:37.840
develop throat cancer, it’s very serious.

01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:44.020
So first, you must know where is your Kundalini,
where it has gone, where it has stopped.

01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:48.410
Then you should know what is the problem,
then you must know what exactly is the chanting

01:33:48.410 --> 01:33:51.560
to be used, all right, and then cure that
part.

01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:58.010
You see so it’s a big science, which has
to be understood in Sahaja Yoga, it’s not

01:33:58.010 --> 01:33:59.010
at random.

01:33:59.010 --> 01:34:04.780
You are suffering from whatever trouble you
are suffering from, you must know first of

01:34:04.780 --> 01:34:05.780
all.

01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:10.830
See many people who are Christians catch on
Agnya I told you, they do, because it’s

01:34:10.830 --> 01:34:11.830
unauthorised.

01:34:11.830 --> 01:34:20.000
Christ, we treat Him as if I don’t know
what, some passion fruit hanging in a tree.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.380
Do we know who He is?

01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:26.770
There is a protocol, great protocol.

01:34:26.770 --> 01:34:31.120
Even Brahma, Vishnu Mahesh could not reach
Him.

01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:38.120
So for us because we think we are born among
Christian families and because the church

01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:43.870
has given us a certificate so called do you
think we are authorised to chant His name

01:34:43.870 --> 01:34:47.690
all the time and trouble Him?

01:34:47.690 --> 01:34:52.360
And what do we ask?

01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:54.030
Do we ask for our spirits?

01:34:54.030 --> 01:34:56.520
Do we ask to give our realisation?

01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:59.450
Do we ask that we have to be born again?

01:34:59.450 --> 01:35:06.650
No, what do we ask something nonsensical.

01:35:06.650 --> 01:35:14.470
Question: What is Your opinion about practicing
spiritualists.

01:35:14.470 --> 01:35:20.410
Shri Mataji: Very dangerous, never go near
them.

01:35:20.410 --> 01:35:26.800
Never touch them even with a barge pole, horrible
things they are.

01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:34.470
You see it is very simple to understand that
if you get connected with any area what so

01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:40.240
ever, and somebody is connected to that area
you are exposed to that and there can be any

01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:43.440
indiscriminate aggression on you from that
area.

01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:45.320
You would not know who’s coming on you.

01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:46.820
So never go near them.

01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:53.720
May be you want to talk to your father say,
whose dead, you want to talk to him.

01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:54.720
Why?

01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:56.500
Release him, free him, why do you want to
talk to him?

01:35:56.500 --> 01:36:00.410
Now let him be alone, let him decide for himself
what he wants to do.

01:36:00.410 --> 01:36:02.330
Why do you want him to hang around?

01:36:02.330 --> 01:36:05.770
It’s too much, it’s too much of a load.

01:36:05.770 --> 01:36:11.950
Then you want to, when you use some medium
for that you do not know he might get somebody

01:36:11.950 --> 01:36:12.950
else.

01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:16.340
It’s very dangerous for your children also,
so many children have died with this kind

01:36:16.340 --> 01:36:17.340
of a thing.

01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:23.320
I mean you develop especially cancer, this
multiple scleroses or anything like that.

01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:26.050
All these come from spiritualists.

01:36:26.050 --> 01:36:30.960
These are all spiritualists, these gurus are
spiritualists only.

01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:34.550
They’ll believe is spirits, they’ll handle
the spirits they’re working out, these are

01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:40.100
very dangerous things I may be able to tell
you some time how they work it out and how

01:36:40.100 --> 01:36:43.310
they master it.

01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:46.530
It’s very dangerous.

01:36:46.530 --> 01:36:50.460
They’re like vampires, what you call it,
vampires.

01:36:50.460 --> 01:36:55.300
More surprising is that there are so many
things in English language, which we don’t

01:36:55.300 --> 01:37:01.090
have, like witchcraft and the witches were
sort of punished, all sorts of things are

01:37:01.090 --> 01:37:02.090
there.

01:37:02.090 --> 01:37:07.970
In England, they talk of all these things
supernatural and all this but still I don’t

01:37:07.970 --> 01:37:11.040
know how they go into it.

01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:16.180
Warren: somebody asked me a question on the
way up.

01:37:16.180 --> 01:37:17.180
Is it wrong to be a medium?

01:37:17.180 --> 01:37:21.410
This relates to the previous question, so
perhaps you could answer that Mother?

01:37:21.410 --> 01:37:28.450
Shri Mataji: Oh God, I need not tell, it’s
very, very wrong to play into the hands of

01:37:28.450 --> 01:37:29.450
the spirits.

01:37:29.450 --> 01:37:32.420
You are enslaved completely; you don’t know
what happens to you.

01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:37.050
Horrible, it creates problems absolutely you’re
an abnormal personality.

01:37:37.050 --> 01:37:38.870
Never do it.

01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:40.700
It’s sinful, sinful.

01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:54.130
If you accept My words really it’s horrible,
never do that.

01:37:54.130 --> 01:37:59.811
Question: What is the difference between western
spirituality and eastern spirituality?

01:37:59.811 --> 01:38:04.040
Shri Mataji:Now this word spirituality means
by these spiritualists you mean?

01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:05.370
Warren: No.

01:38:05.370 --> 01:38:06.370
Philosophy

01:38:06.370 --> 01:38:09.890
Shri Mataji: Is just the same, spirit is just
the same.

01:38:09.890 --> 01:38:16.130
Is universal, there is no difference at all,
I do not find any difference.

01:38:16.130 --> 01:38:23.060
Spirituality means the spirit that is the
Atma, you mean the spirit that is the Atma,

01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:24.060
the one....

01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:29.751
Question: I’m talking more about the quest
for the spirit.

01:38:29.751 --> 01:38:32.880
Shri Mataji: Search is just the same.

01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:40.200
But Indians you see now, modern Indians are
sort of developing you see, they have to go

01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:44.370
to that height to see where you have landed
yourself.

01:38:44.370 --> 01:38:49.882
See they can short circuit, they can short
circuit if they want but if they want they

01:38:49.882 --> 01:38:57.280
may have to go to various types of problems
you had with that affluence and they may come

01:38:57.280 --> 01:38:58.280
back.

01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:01.530
But it is better to short circuit it I tell
them.

01:39:01.530 --> 01:39:12.040
While yours is a problem so easy because you
have discovered now that matter is not sufficient.

01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:16.940
Matter doesn’t give us joy, no use running
after matter.

01:39:16.940 --> 01:39:20.540
But still some of them are running after sex
you see and all that.

01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:25.400
They have to finish another circuit, once
they are over with that also then things will

01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:26.400
be better.

01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:30.550
But in all this kind of a quest you have lost
something indefinitely, no doubt.

01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:35.680
Going through the matter, going through the
sex and going through the power all these

01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:39.690
trips you see you have lost something, which
requires correction.

01:39:39.690 --> 01:39:46.720
While Indians if they understand with their
wisdom they better short circuit this need

01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:49.860
not go into plastics and nylons.

01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:55.340
You see I have to carry nylon saris from England
for Indians while they have their silks they

01:39:55.340 --> 01:39:56.350
want to wear nylon.

01:39:56.350 --> 01:40:03.000
So this is the difference in the basic development.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:08.020
But Indians if they take to Sahaja Yoga they’re
very good and easy, especially Indian villagers

01:40:08.020 --> 01:40:09.020
are excellent.

01:40:09.020 --> 01:40:12.600
They don’t understand all this they have
no mental problems you see.

01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:16.640
I don’t have to discuss with them all these
things, they have not gone into all this nonsense

01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:20.600
so they suddenly become beautiful fruits,
that’s all.

01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:27.310
So this is the difference of little degrees
I would say that you are gone to other extreme

01:40:27.310 --> 01:40:33.320
and you still have to move to that extreme
or they may finish off and we can achieve

01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:34.320
results.

01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:38.670
But your quest is much ardent, very sincere
and truth.

01:40:38.670 --> 01:40:45.900
One more thing I always felt and today also
I feel that really some great souls are born

01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:53.110
in the west, that’s why is such a sincere
desire, very sincere in their desire.

01:40:53.110 --> 01:40:58.320
Indians first they come to Me for curing,
if not for curing for getting children if

01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:02.750
not for that for jobs or money all sorts of
thing they come up.

01:41:02.750 --> 01:41:07.350
Or they’ll say, “My mother is sick, my
father is sick, my brother is this,” all

01:41:07.350 --> 01:41:08.440
this goes on.

01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:14.010
But I have met many, many seekers in the west
who just want realisation, very beautiful

01:41:14.010 --> 01:41:15.910
people no doubt.

01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:21.720
But you have lost something in your seeking,
no doubt, doesn’t matter.

01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:42.100
Kundalini is that ardent desire within you,
which works it out.

01:41:42.100 --> 01:41:52.220
Question: It seems as though the simpler the
life we lead the better we are, it is much

01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:53.220
easier for us.

01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:54.430
We get away from thinking and so on.

01:41:54.430 --> 01:42:02.380
Shri Mataji: I agree is a good idea of simplicity
but is a, you must understand that also very

01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:06.950
clearly because we had somebody who was a
hippy I should say.

01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:13.570
He was a real hippy, such big grown, he had
grown hair up to this much and all that.

01:42:13.570 --> 01:42:18.320
He came to Me and scarcely wearing anything
in the horrible English cold you see.

01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:22.050
I said, “What are you doing to yourself
why don’t you clad your self properly into

01:42:22.050 --> 01:42:26.600
proper clothes and better cover yourself,”
and I was really didn’t understand him.

01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:30.740
I said, “You are not living in Africa why
are you dressed up like this, it’s like

01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:31.740
a primitive dress."

01:42:31.740 --> 01:42:33.410
He said, “I want to be primitive."

01:42:33.410 --> 01:42:35.960
I said, “You cannot by dressing up.

01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:41.360
Your brain is so over developed how can you
be primitive."

01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:43.590
You see by dressing up something do you become
that.

01:42:43.590 --> 01:42:49.160
I mean it’s just a drama you are playing
with yourself, you do not become primitive.

01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:54.891
This is the point is that and then the problem
is the brain is thinking the same way, that

01:42:54.891 --> 01:43:01.110
the same rate and everything the same, only
by changing is something that is not good

01:43:01.110 --> 01:43:02.810
because you should accept as you are.

01:43:02.810 --> 01:43:05.860
Why to do something like that?

01:43:05.860 --> 01:43:11.810
But simpler life means this way, that’s
another extreme.

01:43:11.810 --> 01:43:24.150
But you see too much of formality like having
a tail coat or wearing morning dress, grey

01:43:24.150 --> 01:43:29.220
suit and then having a particular type of
a glass for a thing and all that nonsense

01:43:29.220 --> 01:43:30.580
you see you better finish off.

01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:37.610
That’s bit too much going too far with it
and also caring for all these small, small

01:43:37.610 --> 01:43:43.490
things like matter that’s something that’s
grown in you.

01:43:43.490 --> 01:43:47.820
Preservation of horrible things and useless
things and all that it’s [really?].

01:43:47.820 --> 01:43:51.580
And then to think, think, think, think about
everything, sit down and think how miserable

01:43:51.580 --> 01:43:55.650
I am and when there is no misery you just
sit down and make miseries by thinking.

01:43:55.650 --> 01:43:59.060
I don’t find any thing miserable here, what
is there?

01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:04.430
You see in India these people where there
people are so happy, chirping just like birds

01:44:04.430 --> 01:44:05.430
enjoying themselves.

01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:09.160
They don’t have all the things that you
have.

01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:13.990
So you see to get out of materialism is a
better idea, to say that a simpler life means,

01:44:13.990 --> 01:44:15.790
but you must live beautifully.

01:44:15.790 --> 01:44:20.050
Beautiful doesn’t mean that you should have
ten types of things and all that.

01:44:20.050 --> 01:44:24.710
Beautifully means you should not be as a morbid
stinking, you see.

01:44:24.710 --> 01:44:32.150
Clean and beautiful you can make beauty out
of the soil anything; with love, you can do

01:44:32.150 --> 01:44:33.150
anything.

01:44:33.150 --> 01:44:36.970
So you see it’s alright I mean what ever
way you dress up or anything makes no difference

01:44:36.970 --> 01:44:38.760
that’s what I’m trying to say.

01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:41.400
That it is the inner thing that has to change
not the outer.

01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:43.230
Again the Sahaja Yoga is this.
