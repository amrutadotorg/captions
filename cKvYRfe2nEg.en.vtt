00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:16.609
[Music]

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:22.300
so now the other Center which we have

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.090
here is very important center call as

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.200
the vishuddhi chakra this is the center

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.140
we shoot them

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.980
one is shoot them in spoon but we should

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:36.430
the means absolutely pure this has got

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.760
60 patterns as we have got the cervical

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.790
plexus expressed the gross which has

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.980
also got sixteen sub-plexuses

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:50.740
it tallies with medical science

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:53.500
completely now let us see how is

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:57.790
vishuddhi chakra maintains all the

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:04.089
baubles that he used governorship

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:06.690
teacher and like in Devanagari language

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.870
duties ah

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.870
[Music]

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:22.110
aha so as you know that you cannot come

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:29.810
by the word without a moment it's so

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:34.110
important the consonant is weak without

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:41.700
near but without any stay without the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:43.590
wall so the strength of a person comes

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.940
through the vishuddhi chakra in his

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.280
speech it's the center what we call here

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.520
is the vishuddhi chakra is the center

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.220
where human beings raise their head up

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.740
this is the center that has made us a

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.250
human being and from this Center only

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.430
Rises the ego and superego because this

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.039
is the center of collectivity because we

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.170
speak through the center we talk through

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.209
this we have rapport with other people

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.410
through this and as a reaction to that

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:18.930
ego and superego is built within us when

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:23.700
that is built within us we become a

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.830
personality I am some he is some you are

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:32.519
some at that point

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:36.840
we become a person who has the

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:40.350
consciousness of ilus like then I say I

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.600
like this I want this say I will say I

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.329
am an Indian you will say I'm an

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.120
Englishman all these misidentifications

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:51.060
start because you become an individual

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:55.560
who tries to identify with many things

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:59.549
that's how we become separated from that

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:03.209
power this is the freedom we get where

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:05.700
we have to ourself learn from our errors

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.180
and trials what is right and what is

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.910
wrong this vishuddhi chakra is has got

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.650
sixteen petals and looks after our ear

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:18.540
nose eyes throat everything our face

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.150
everything is looked after by descent

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.660
now this Center also has left and right

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.160
all centers have left and

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:29.590
and when you feel guilty the left Center

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.840
gadgets which is a very dangerous thing

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.540
because this gives you diseases like

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.830
angina or maybe diseases like

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.550
spondylitis

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.870
and lethargic organs right when a person

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.570
is very aggressive talks very

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:48.820
aggressively and tries to dominate

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:51.610
others and use his power of speech to

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.500
show off the right side catches the the

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.980
reactions of this can be many that the

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.260
hand gets frozen and they also get the

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.890
cancer of the throat all kinds of things

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.540
can happen with this chakra being in

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:09.780
Japan

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.780
[Music]

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:23.490
now a person who shouts and screams and

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:27.210
talks loudly and loses is tempered in a

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:31.320
very loud voice or who speaks very

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:35.330
loudly all the time they all suffer from

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:38.730
the right wishes so one should

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.950
understand that even when you have to

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.540
score somebody you have to just say what

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.290
are you doing why are you doing like

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.280
this

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:52.860
otherwise why oh it's finished I'd push

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:56.790
it over finished now this is the things

00:04:52.860 --> 00:05:00.950
on the right side if you are talking

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:05.750
loudly if you talk too much

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:09.360
if you intimidate people with your

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:12.330
talking then you catch on right

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.330
vishuddhi so for that best is to take

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:18.270
some rest and give some rest - you're

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:22.250
right we should be by stopping your talk

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:25.350
go into mana they said just don't talk

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.060
for some time if you don't have you'll

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.000
see that where we should be will be

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:34.110
improved your problems will be in - so

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.570
what is the divine diplomacy you don't

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:45.390
have to shout but you change the subject

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:48.330
if you want to bring somebody to a some

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:51.450
conclusion the best thing is first you

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.670
change the subject and gradually if you

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:57.590
are clever enough then you go on

00:05:53.670 --> 00:06:01.650
changing changing and you bring it back

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:04.430
to the right thing that's the clever

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.430
thing to do

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:11.419
what is the essence of this diplomacy

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:27.240
its benevolence you have to achieve the

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:30.030
benevolence of the whole humanity this

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.280
is the essence of it if you are doing it

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.110
you are not doing for yourself for your

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.389
game you are not doing for the gain of

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:40.169
any particular person but you are doing

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:43.290
it for the benefits of the whole

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:47.070
humanity so once you know this is the

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:48.600
essence so what is the need to shout by

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:51.780
shouting you are not going to achieve

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.660
anything so to play around with it and

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:58.620
bring it to that point which is

00:06:53.660 --> 00:07:06.260
benevolence so our right we should be we

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:10.410
have to have a temperament a culture a

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:12.780
style a behavior which has got the

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:17.220
quality which is called as midoriya

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:20.340
means melodious melodious you should

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:24.419
talk in such a manner that it should be

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:27.780
melodious the voice of a sahaja yogi

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:32.060
should be sweet like that when you talk

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:35.580
to someone it should be melodies

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:38.130
it should not be aggressive at all but

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:41.340
on the contrary it should be melodious

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:44.880
it should not be sarcastic it should not

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:48.870
hurt another person any word that hurts

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:52.680
others cannot be coming from the proper

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:58.320
type of rightfully so in no way one

00:07:52.680 --> 00:08:01.560
should hurt the another quality which we

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:05.700
can express through our right we should

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:08.310
ease diplomacy but there are two types

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:12.020
of diplomacy's one is genuine one is

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:15.330
artificial in the genuine diplomacy you

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:18.599
do not have to take to a certain

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.430
standard or you don't have to read some

00:08:18.599 --> 00:08:23.660
books

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:27.230
to know how it is diplomacy is it

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:31.640
genuinely it comes to you it the whole

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:35.600
thing works very sweetly in such a

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:38.720
genuine manner I have used it many a

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:41.360
times myself and you all can use it also

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:44.480
many a time that's only possible if you

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:46.630
don't get angry with not possible if you

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.630
are

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:57.880
[Music]

00:08:55.890 --> 00:09:00.220
relationship between brothers and

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:03.580
sisters have to be established a very

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:09.070
pure brothers and sisters relationship

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:11.740
is without any lust or greed it's pure

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:15.900
relationship where the sister prays for

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:22.240
the protection of the brother and

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:24.060
brother play pray praise for the

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:31.120
self-sufficiency

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:33.580
now the Chima will be of the system so

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:37.410
this time you have to think of your

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:41.650
other sahaja Yogi's and sahaja Yogi's

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:45.220
who are like your brothers and sisters

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:49.570
you have to think like that purify your

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:50.980
hearts something funny in this countries

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:55.870
you know that there's no such

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:56.440
relationship bases purify your mind

00:09:55.870 --> 00:10:00.279
today

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:04.980
on that point that everybody else is my

00:10:00.279 --> 00:10:08.170
brother or sister if you have married

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:11.020
but look at everyone try to look at

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:19.029
everyone as a brother and a sister when

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:24.750
the sister who is your pure relation is

00:10:19.029 --> 00:10:31.170
not treated as a sister when the

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:35.500
attitude of a person towards women is of

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:39.370
indulgence and of lust then he develops

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:43.180
the left with you when he develops her

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:46.990
left we should be very strongly and if

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:49.630
he has a bad Agia or affairs eyes which

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:53.110
are roving eyes then this left vishuddhi

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:56.110
causes a lot of trouble left vishuddhi

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:57.760
cannot be also caused by as you know by

00:10:56.110 --> 00:11:02.620
feeling guilty about things for nothing

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:03.890
at all all these problems arise from

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:08.149
issues

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:15.890
the left side Center is what up when a

00:11:08.149 --> 00:11:21.620
person feels guilty and obstruct the

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:24.019
scent of the Kundalini that's why I

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:28.399
always request all the Western seekers

00:11:24.019 --> 00:11:38.149
first to say in their hearts mother I am

00:11:28.399 --> 00:11:43.940
NOT GUILTY these are the conditionings

00:11:38.149 --> 00:11:45.640
that have come to us from so-called

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:50.300
religions

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:52.700
from so-called psychologists and other

00:11:50.300 --> 00:12:00.260
people who are responsible for our

00:11:52.700 --> 00:12:03.050
development in our childhood when

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:10.100
material things very important for the

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:11.870
parents they all the time shout at

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:14.240
children or correct them saying that

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:17.380
don't spoil the carpet don't spoil that

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.380
don't spoil that

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:32.410
and that is how we develop a kind of a

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:35.050
guilt within us when we grow up in the

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:45.340
schools and colleges this can be built

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:50.530
up very heavily within us - so how much

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:54.400
important it is to understand the value

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:57.610
of left which all of us catch on left

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:59.530
which is D and we do not think that it

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:01.120
is such an important thing where is your

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:04.000
left Rashida catching means I am feeling

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.470
guilty we do not understand that what

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.790
have I done I have crossed the limits

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:13.000
that's why he's showing there I have

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:16.060
neglected some kind of a morality I have

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.820
gone on a wrong path against mother and

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:21.430
father that's why I left we should be

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:25.330
sketching left switch we should be is

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:28.780
the indication of the mistakes of the

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:30.940
wrongs of the sins we can't afford to

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:34.450
have left to shooting sahaja Yogi's

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:37.030
cannot afford to have left now what I

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:42.280
have seen that when this negativity

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:45.100
starts acting people instead of facing

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:46.840
it facing the mistakes that I am wrong I

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:49.200
should not have done it it's a wrong

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:52.240
thing to do start giving explanations

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:54.670
once you start giving explanation this

00:13:52.240 --> 00:14:00.330
left vishudhi starts becoming like a

00:13:54.670 --> 00:14:03.190
bloated big lump and then there's no

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:05.470
possibility of curing no possibility of

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:08.470
cleansing so people start giving

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:11.830
explanation why I did it why I do this

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:13.570
once it is said it's wrong is wrong to

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:17.850
be accepted all right next time I'm not

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:17.850
going to do it I'm very sorry

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:55.549
