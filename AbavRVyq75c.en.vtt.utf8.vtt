[Music]

00:23.039 --> 00:40.710
the word guru comes from the one which

00:32.769 --> 00:47.260
is magnetic the person who is magnetic

00:40.710 --> 00:55.719
the one it attracts the attention of the

00:47.260 --> 01:04.259
seekers is the Guru also it means the

00:55.719 --> 01:13.420
heaviness or you can say a person who is

01:04.259 --> 01:20.259
very steady who is very deep who has the

01:13.420 --> 01:27.149
knowledge and who can act like the

01:20.259 --> 01:33.000
mother earth for the power of magnetism

01:27.149 --> 01:36.700
in the mother earth also is called as

01:33.000 --> 01:46.420
magnetic but in sanskrit is guru to

01:36.700 --> 01:50.409
occur sure means the attraction of the

01:46.420 --> 01:58.600
heaviness of the mother but actually it

01:50.409 --> 02:04.859
is a power of the mother earth that

01:58.600 --> 02:09.369
makes us stand for he on our legs when

02:04.859 --> 02:14.410
it is rotating with such a tremendous

02:09.369 --> 02:18.040
speed otherwise he would be all thrown

02:14.410 --> 02:25.209
away with that velocity that she is

02:18.040 --> 02:33.190
moving we are still attached or we are

02:25.209 --> 02:33.950
one in our balance is only because she

02:33.190 --> 02:43.030
has

02:33.950 --> 02:54.370
gravity this gravity has to be in a guru

02:43.030 --> 02:54.370
gravity means a kind of a serious

02:54.670 --> 03:07.310
understanding of oneself and one's own

03:00.610 --> 03:14.060
responsibilities so a guru has to be

03:07.310 --> 03:21.920
very steady in these modern times people

03:14.060 --> 03:28.340
are very mobile all the time as you take

03:21.920 --> 03:30.230
it all the time getting disturbed small

03:28.340 --> 03:36.319
things happening here and there they get

03:30.230 --> 03:41.410
it they meet people who are not of any

03:36.319 --> 03:47.139
quality then they get disturbed these

03:41.410 --> 03:51.859
disturbing qualities come from our

03:47.139 --> 03:54.760
deficiency in our gravity a person who

03:51.859 --> 03:59.630
has gravity does not get depressed

03:54.760 --> 04:03.200
neither get excited not get overly

03:59.630 --> 04:08.030
enthusiastic not easy

04:03.200 --> 04:14.120
very sad or unhappy so he is in the

04:08.030 --> 04:17.060
center he is in the center of his be the

04:14.120 --> 04:23.950
most level we think a good guru is that

04:17.060 --> 04:23.950
person who

04:25.870 --> 04:50.020
just attraction towards themselves body

04:38.030 --> 04:50.020
language or maybe other attractions

04:52.480 --> 05:04.840
which are gross and that's why people

04:58.130 --> 05:04.840
always go to the Guru's who are false

05:04.960 --> 05:18.770
who are superficial but the one who is

05:13.850 --> 05:27.110
above the gravity of the mother earth

05:18.770 --> 05:31.810
the gross the subtle the subtle subtler

05:27.110 --> 05:38.140
in the subtlest beyond all these

05:31.810 --> 05:44.720
attractions that is the one is the Guru

05:38.140 --> 05:49.960
where is your attention is important if

05:44.720 --> 05:49.960
you are the Guru wearing your attention

05:51.310 --> 06:02.210
if your attention is on the correction

05:57.230 --> 06:05.780
and the nourishment of yourself are no

06:02.210 --> 06:08.290
further then you are first of all the

06:05.780 --> 06:08.290
sahaja yogi

06:11.130 --> 06:22.950
and once you rise above the

06:17.610 --> 06:28.380
gravitational force of materialism then

06:22.950 --> 06:31.740
you could be called as the good you do

06:28.380 --> 06:34.650
not need education for that in your city

06:31.740 --> 06:40.260
education you need not read books you

06:34.650 --> 06:43.020
need not do anything only thing is that

06:40.260 --> 06:47.370
you have to have your value system

06:43.020 --> 06:49.710
correctly in your value system you have

06:47.370 --> 06:58.670
to first of all understand what is

06:49.710 --> 07:05.070
auspiciousness what is divine beauty and

06:58.670 --> 07:09.180
what is morality of the Spirit these

07:05.070 --> 07:12.860
fittings are to be alive and how to be

07:09.180 --> 07:15.660
part and parcel of your being so that

07:12.860 --> 07:19.380
when people see you they should say it

07:15.660 --> 07:23.520
here is a person you can see who has

07:19.380 --> 07:27.570
that gravity here is the person who has

07:23.520 --> 07:30.750
that you then he talks to others he

07:27.570 --> 07:31.730
talks with them he doesn't talk to

07:30.750 --> 07:39.860
frivolous things

07:31.730 --> 07:43.580
useless things I think which are of very

07:39.860 --> 07:43.580
basic level

07:44.380 --> 07:57.480
in an all enter crisis I would say he

07:52.000 --> 08:01.030
has a kind of a decency and a decoder so

07:57.480 --> 08:04.600
not that the Guru himself has the value

08:01.030 --> 08:09.160
system but through his lifestyle through

08:04.600 --> 08:16.020
his own teachings through his own

08:09.160 --> 08:18.430
behavior he radiates gravity plus dvdx

08:16.020 --> 08:19.140
grammatical so either none of this

08:18.430 --> 08:25.960
gravity

08:19.140 --> 08:28.540
Evette discrimination let you know what

08:25.960 --> 08:31.240
is your personality and what is the

08:28.540 --> 08:35.530
water barometer you know how to

08:31.240 --> 08:39.160
discriminate and this discrimination is

08:35.530 --> 08:44.320
also actually innately comes from your

08:39.160 --> 08:46.900
guru person now and then I suppose you

08:44.320 --> 08:51.070
have constable you have come out of here

08:46.900 --> 08:55.570
so that yeah transcendence all those

08:51.070 --> 08:57.430
things through your amun-re but that

08:55.570 --> 09:05.350
does not mean that you have developed

08:57.430 --> 09:11.560
that gravity you have now achieved a

09:05.350 --> 09:14.500
state if a flower is there and you push

09:11.560 --> 09:16.560
it put the flower on the water it will

09:14.500 --> 09:16.560
float

09:17.520 --> 09:24.690
but when it becomes the fruit and

09:20.550 --> 09:27.200
matures then you put it in the water it

09:24.690 --> 09:30.780
does not feel it goes tick-tock

09:27.200 --> 09:35.880
it does not get dissolved it keeps its

09:30.780 --> 09:38.550
own identity that is what is to be done

09:35.880 --> 09:44.070
now that you have to become the fruits

09:38.550 --> 09:49.610
of reading now all of you can become

09:44.070 --> 09:54.030
gurus every one of you can become goose

09:49.610 --> 09:56.670
and can develop that great capacity to

09:54.030 --> 10:05.130
be being one with that cosmic

09:56.670 --> 10:09.200
consciousness completely out of the

10:05.130 --> 10:09.200
clutches of the gravity of the earth

10:09.290 --> 10:21.210
materialism without achieving that you

10:17.100 --> 10:27.630
have no right to tell it anybody what is

10:21.210 --> 10:30.840
to be done first it should be your

10:27.630 --> 10:36.810
practice and preserve it in your own

10:30.840 --> 10:39.590
life in your own example and then your

10:36.810 --> 10:43.050
example is sufficient to convince others

10:39.590 --> 10:45.510
and this is what they have to see if we

10:43.050 --> 10:49.650
can develop that gravity within our

10:45.510 --> 10:58.310
sense and understanding within okay well

10:49.650 --> 11:01.290
happy resides within you the joy of

10:58.310 --> 11:04.440
becoming sahaja Yogi's will be really

11:01.290 --> 11:09.150
effect will be really understood and

11:04.440 --> 11:11.630
will be enjoyed by all of it may God

11:09.150 --> 11:11.630
bless you
